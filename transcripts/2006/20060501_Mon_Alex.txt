[00:00:05.803 --> 00:00:06.444]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:08.144]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:09.985]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:11.445]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:13.126]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.487]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:22.088]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.370]  Well, it's May Day.
[00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:30.471]  The ancient druidic...
[00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:40.560]  Hi, holy day that was adopted by the murdering communist near the beginning of the last century.
[00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:50.586]  And today in the United States, millions of illegal aliens and their supporters are boycotting America.
[00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:51.486]  Boycotting.
[00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:51.706]  Why?
[00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:55.108]  To show everyone how they make the country run.
[00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:56.569]  They make the country operate.
[00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.792]  If it wasn't for all of this third world labor, we'd all be in the poorhouse.
[00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:07.665]  Kind of like when Democrats and Republicans tell us how wonderful China is, de-industrializing the United States.
[00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:15.909]  How wonderful it is that almost all Americans have seen their pay go down the last decade, and our manufacturing go offshore.
[00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.832]  So we'll get into a very important article that Paul Watson and I put out with some new developments.
[00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:26.634]  Bushite neocons responsible for May Day immigration protest.
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:37.846]  And we have the variant headline over at InfoWars.com that Bush and Fox governments hire U.S.
[00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:41.008]  PR firm to stage demonstrations and rallies.
[00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:49.693]  Today's scenes do not herald new civil rights movement, only invading army of foreigners, a fifth column.
[00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:51.414]  We'll get into this report.
[00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:53.856]  Also, speaking of Mexico, something good they're doing.
[00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:57.593]  But I'll give you my take on why they're doing it and it's not for a good reason.
[00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:03.828]  Mexico to legalize personal pot cocaine and heroin use.
[00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:10.049]  Also, Colbert lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner.
[00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.890]  President Bush not amused.
[00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.011]  We're going to play the whole thing coming up in exactly 30 minutes, 45 seconds.
[00:02:18.632 --> 00:02:28.414]  So at the bottom of the hour, when we come out of that break at 33 after, we will play the entire 13-minute piece and then continue with the news.
[00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:33.876]  In the meantime, we'll get into the open borders and the Iran situation that's really starting to heat up.
[00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:36.764]  MSNBC had a big poll.
[00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:40.565]  Do you believe President Bush misled the nation in order to go to war with Iraq?
[00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:43.165]  94% say yes.
[00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:48.787]  Meanwhile, the Boston Globe has the headline, Bush challenges hundreds of laws.
[00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.208]  President cites powers of his office.
[00:02:51.268 --> 00:03:02.351]  Now, if I say I believe that the criminalization of marijuana is bad, and then I go and protest the law, I'm challenging it.
[00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:17.701]  Or if once I'm in court, say I've been taken in, hypothetically I don't smoke marijuana, but let's say I've been taken in for having a marijuana cigarette, a joint, and I then challenge the law in court, that would be different.
[00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.101]  No, no, no.
[00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.083]  Bush just says he's above the law, and that's called tyranny.
[00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:26.385]  In fact, the comment here is, the headline should read, Bush Breaks Hundreds of Laws.
[00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.307]  If you or I challenge the law in the same way, Bush...
[00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.510]  ...has, we would be in jail.
[00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.331]  Again, the headline should read, Bush Breaks Hundreds of Laws.
[00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:39.913]  If you or I challenge the law in the way Bush has, we would be in jail.
[00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:47.898]  So we'll get into this whole above-the-law position that Bush and his controllers have.
[00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:50.819]  Really scary article here out of the Associated Press.
[00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.821]  Bird flu hitting TV screens May 9th.
[00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:05.634]  And it says here that martial law, barbed wire surrounding neighborhoods, troops, total control, all part of the conditioning.
[00:04:08.535 --> 00:04:16.959]  By the way, we have the Schindlers who haven't been on with us since they murdered, since they took the food and water away from Terry Shivo Schindler.
[00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:21.888]  And it's, of course, been the one-year anniversary late last month.
[00:04:22.408 --> 00:04:39.893]  We have them joining us coming up the third hour because now Michael Cockroach Shivo, this poster boy for the pro-euthanasia death crowd, has created a new foundation trying to block what the Schindlers are doing, trying to save others.
[00:04:40.973 --> 00:04:44.774]  All part of the culture of death feeds right into Professor Pianca.
[00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:47.185]  90% of us need to die.
[00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.607]  The dying needs to start now.
[00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:53.352]  We'll be talking about the whole pro-death crowd in the second hour.
[00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.475]  We'll have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.697]  Powerful show lined up for you.
[00:04:58.018 --> 00:04:58.999]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.476]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:06.437]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.537 --> 00:05:07.317]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:12.340]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:19.425]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.745 --> 00:05:21.725]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:24.766]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:29.507]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.727 --> 00:05:34.128]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:41.590]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.251]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:46.151]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:52.321]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit Infowars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:59.312]  That's Infowars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:12.822]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:13.003 --> 00:06:20.528]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:23.971]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:29.976]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:30.276 --> 00:06:36.418]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:36.778 --> 00:06:40.679]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.600]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.741]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:52.682]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:58.024 --> 00:06:58.484]  We're good to go.
[00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:21.519]  We're good to go.
[00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:36.865]  We're good to go.
[00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:37.326]  We're good to go.
[00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:37.726]  We're good to go.
[00:08:02.242 --> 00:08:04.423]  He's the T-Rex in political talk.
[00:08:05.003 --> 00:08:07.785]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.034 --> 00:08:29.954]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:30.174 --> 00:08:40.618]  It is May Day, Communist Celebration Day, a cultic celebration day for all the illegal aliens running around on our streets trying to disrupt our nation with the goal of, quote, shutting the U.S.
[00:08:40.678 --> 00:08:41.058]  down.
[00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:45.620]  We'll be getting into that coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:53.463]  We're going to play the entire speech that Mr. Colbert of Comedy Central gave at the White House Correspondents' Ball.
[00:08:54.901 --> 00:09:00.724]  It is classic, and I just love the satirical approach that he takes, agreeing with everything that's happening.
[00:09:00.784 --> 00:09:03.345]  So we'll be rolling that.
[00:09:03.865 --> 00:09:04.905]  Bush was not pleased, though.
[00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:13.869]  He was pleased when Ozzy Osbourne was there, talking about reigning death and hell and destruction, but he didn't like Colbert and was visibly shaken and upset about it.
[00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.211]  But let me go ahead and launch into this first.
[00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:19.572]  This is from prisonplanet.com.
[00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:25.084]  Of course, several weeks ago, we pointed this out and really broke the news.
[00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:34.209]  And it's funny, we can write a little story, say, about cell phones being bad for your brain, or we can put a story out about a Second Amendment issue.
[00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:38.971]  I never know what's going to get picked up by thousands of websites and get millions of visitors.
[00:09:39.131 --> 00:09:45.895]  We just report on what we think is most important, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason in what stories get legs and are big.
[00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:48.348]  This story should be huge.
[00:09:48.448 --> 00:09:51.869]  This story should be one of the biggest things in the country.
[00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:54.150]  It's easily verifiable.
[00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.892]  I don't even care if PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com gets visitors.
[00:09:59.492 --> 00:10:07.076]  This is something that thousands of other sites, hundreds of other immigration sites, pro and con, should be reporting on.
[00:10:07.196 --> 00:10:10.317]  It is mega scandalous.
[00:10:11.608 --> 00:10:24.159]  It shows that all of the past four plus weeks of demonstrations and protesting and riot light taking over roads, the rest of it, that we've been seeing is staged.
[00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:36.689]  Now, there was a Dallas Morning News article on Christmas Day, December 25th of last year, what, four, five months ago.
[00:10:38.466 --> 00:10:47.690]  And it said that the PR firm that Bush used for his gubernatorial run, his presidential run, these are Edward Bernays' mastermind types.
[00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.431]  It's the same group that Fox used in 2000 to get elected.
[00:10:52.378 --> 00:11:13.647]  This is so important that they were engaged by the President of Mexico to stage mass demonstrations and protest and to steer a major political move inside the United States to harness this literal fifth column of 25 to 30 million illegal aliens, mainly from Mexico,
[00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:30.617]  To bully the American people into backing off and shooting down legislation in the House and Senate that would make it a felony for these illegal aliens to be here illegally, and that would also get a little bit of funding, a small increase of funding for the border and Border Patrol.
[00:11:32.438 --> 00:11:38.742]  In your face, openly in the Dallas Morning News, the PR firm admitted they'd been hired to do this.
[00:11:40.336 --> 00:11:56.246]  Now since then, the Associated Press and others have reported that indeed the Spanish media did coordinate the demonstrations for three months beforehand, that it was a concerted effort with talking points, that it was a unified program.
[00:11:56.266 --> 00:11:59.628]  You saw that with the white shirts and the American flags.
[00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:09.615]  But imagine the magnitude of this if the American people learned that George Bush and Vicente Fox met at the ranch in December,
[00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:19.931]  Came up with this plan, hired the PR firm, sent the PR firm out for the next three plus months to prepare and stage this whole event.
[00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:29.817]  Meanwhile, the English-speaking media owned by the globalists is saying, oh, they're friendly immigrants, they love America, oh, they just want a better life, they're good people.
[00:12:30.877 --> 00:12:36.000]  They're trying to pacify the population of the U.S., whether you're Hispanic, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.882]  People that love America and are citizens are here legally.
[00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:40.758]  Who are the vast majority?
[00:12:40.798 --> 00:12:41.741]  Now the numbers are almost 92%.
[00:12:43.815 --> 00:12:46.357]  It was like 91.7 in a big Gallup poll.
[00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:49.739]  It's gone from 87 to 91 plus percent.
[00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:52.741]  That's mainstream news now.
[00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:54.002]  So it's backfired.
[00:12:54.062 --> 00:13:04.808]  So they're attempting to keep the demonstrations going to try to spin it because the first two weeks that we saw all the Mexican flags and the this is our continent and get out gringo, it backfired.
[00:13:04.848 --> 00:13:10.272]  The PR firm was unable to control the majority of the reconquerors that are here.
[00:13:12.766 --> 00:13:33.060]  But the news, what's really important is that this is admittedly staged, and it was in the Dallas Morning News, there was a blurb in the AP, but they're only telling you about part of the story, and if the American people learn that Bush is literally with Fox staging all of this, if you think they're mad now, they're really going to get mad.
[00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:37.223]  So I'm begging everyone, go to prisonplanet.com.
[00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:39.442]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:13:39.762 --> 00:13:42.843]  Get the new article we put out last night and this morning.
[00:13:43.043 --> 00:13:45.104]  Paul really wrote it last night with some of my input.
[00:13:45.485 --> 00:13:47.406]  Article by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:51.708]  Get this out to everyone and tell these websites.
[00:13:52.568 --> 00:13:53.589]  Tell these websites.
[00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:55.189]  Please.
[00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:56.630]  Please.
[00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:59.770]  Please, write your own stories.
[00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:01.472]  Check out our claims.
[00:14:01.572 --> 00:14:02.652]  Find out they're true.
[00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:06.074]  Read the Dallas Morning News from four plus months ago.
[00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:09.376]  And then write your own articles about this.
[00:14:09.597 --> 00:14:11.037]  This is the zeitgeist.
[00:14:11.398 --> 00:14:12.618]  This can bring them down.
[00:14:12.758 --> 00:14:14.560]  This will expose them.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.901]  This is so important.
[00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.723]  Now, I've got to give credit where credit's due.
[00:14:20.903 --> 00:14:24.926]  Common Dreams, which is a big, huge, liberal website.
[00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:29.212]  Did put out a report, and it's somewhere here in my massive stack.
[00:14:29.232 --> 00:14:30.012]  I'll get to it later.
[00:14:30.032 --> 00:14:31.452]  I was trying to find it during the last break.
[00:14:32.352 --> 00:14:33.792]  I printed it Saturday.
[00:14:34.712 --> 00:14:38.433]  I literally have a story of over 100 articles, a stack of over 100 articles here in the stack.
[00:14:39.013 --> 00:14:39.813]  I was trying to find it.
[00:14:40.634 --> 00:14:54.336]  But Common Dreams has an article admitting that NAFTA created the influx of these illegal aliens, or accelerated it, and that Bush wants this, and that Bush is manipulating the illegal aliens, the illegal immigrants.
[00:14:55.029 --> 00:15:03.532]  Now, they don't have all the details, they haven't done the research that we've done, but even the liberals, real liberals, see what's happening.
[00:15:04.173 --> 00:15:18.998]  Also, imagine if you explained to all these illegal aliens and their supporters, who are out there in many cases protesting Bush, if you explained to them, I mean, they got signs saying Bush hired the Minutemen and other such delusional statements whenever Bush has called the Minutemen vigilantes.
[00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:20.719]  Imagine!
[00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:28.835]  We're able to educate the illegal alien population that this is a staged op between our two governments.
[00:15:29.976 --> 00:15:31.297]  This is about globalization.
[00:15:31.337 --> 00:15:32.458]  This is about globalism.
[00:15:32.738 --> 00:15:34.359]  This is about getting rid of our borders.
[00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.440]  It's that simple.
[00:15:36.337 --> 00:15:40.839]  And notice, our media tells the American people, don't protest, lay down, don't get involved.
[00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.300]  You're extremists when you protest.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.821]  You know, you're weirdos.
[00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:45.062]  Oh, you might get arrested.
[00:15:45.302 --> 00:15:52.805]  They send riot police out for even small demonstrations of conservatives or liberals, land rights activists, anti-war demonstrators.
[00:15:52.886 --> 00:15:57.588]  Notice how they act whenever a mainstream group that's pro-America does something.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:13.412]  But then when these illegal aliens do all this, you don't see riot police, the media spends everything they do as good, the media barely reports back in the newspapers how the illegal aliens have been attacking blacks and whites all over the country.
[00:16:14.814 --> 00:16:15.514]  It's terrible.
[00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:17.436]  So here's the article.
[00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:26.123]  Bushite neocons responsible for May Day immigration protests today's scenes do not herald new civil rights movement, only invading army of foreigners.
[00:16:26.863 --> 00:16:40.540]  Today's massive immigration protests, which are being afforded lavish and complimentary media attention, were orchestrated by the neocons and the Bush administration and represent a fifth column movement openly intent on destroying America as we know it.
[00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:47.577]  The agenda is multifaceted and includes protecting government drug-running operations, balkanizing the U.S.
[00:16:47.637 --> 00:16:55.023]  and lowering the standard of living, and inciting race riots that lead to the justification of martial law and internment procedures being implemented.
[00:16:55.564 --> 00:17:03.450]  As we reported last month, in late December of 2005, Mexican President Vicente Fox hired a lobbying firm to sweeten political sentiment in the U.S.
[00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.832]  towards Mexicans and immigration issues.
[00:17:06.212 --> 00:17:06.792]  We're good to go.
[00:17:06.852 --> 00:17:07.132]  I think?
[00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.033]  So, again, they're doing it now here secretly, but it's really no secret at all.
[00:17:36.074 --> 00:17:42.639]  The very media being PR'd, being part of this program, taking orders from Rob Allen Co., is helping cover this up.
[00:17:42.699 --> 00:17:47.923]  Let's break that dam of news blackout.
[00:17:48.985 --> 00:18:02.157]  There can be no doubt that a foreign government is working in tandem with the government of the United States and a powerful politically connected public relations firm to manufacture consent and to hold back a growing grassroots movement to defend America's sovereignty.
[00:18:02.677 --> 00:18:06.361]  The LA Times reported that Vicente Fox hired Allen & Co.
[00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:11.025]  when the rumblings of immigration reform began to be heard in Congress.
[00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:17.711]  The legislation that Fox found so shameful, that's a quote, is the very same that is being protested so vehemently by hundreds of thousands around the country.
[00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:42.225]  The mainstream media's massive protest coverage kept coming back to a few central themes.
[00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:46.407]  The protesters are against criminalizing the illegals crossing to the U.S.
[00:18:46.468 --> 00:18:51.250]  borders, and they are seeking a blanket amnesty for undocumented immigrants currently residing in the country.
[00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.312]  Fox turned to Allen & Co.
[00:18:53.652 --> 00:18:57.114]  to push this very agenda and to defeat specific legislation.
[00:18:57.394 --> 00:19:00.596]  It even says in the article that they were going to defeat the legislation which they now have done.
[00:19:01.903 --> 00:19:07.767]  An LA Times report of last December's announcement quotes Allen pictured on his tactics on behalf of Fox.
[00:19:08.688 --> 00:19:19.115]  Our focus is on public opinion, which influences policy outcomes in Congress, said Allen, 46, who grew up in Huntington Beach, California, and moved to Texas when he was in high school.
[00:19:19.395 --> 00:19:22.697]  There is a huge misperception among the U.S.
[00:19:22.777 --> 00:19:24.098]  public about Mexico.
[00:19:25.311 --> 00:19:31.216]  Allen set up a phony human rights front group called Democracy Watch, supposedly to monitor elections in Mexico.
[00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:37.081]  The group solicited donations and used money to illegally sway the Mexican election in favor of Vicente Fox.
[00:19:37.101 --> 00:19:39.243]  When we get back, I'll finish up the article.
[00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.285]  It's lengthy and detailed.
[00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:42.606]  Good job, Paul Watson.
[00:19:44.647 --> 00:19:46.929]  So, here it is, the smoking guy.
[00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.851]  This can really hurt him.
[00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.921]  We can expose this as being staged.
[00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:59.090]  If not, they're going to cement this new, quote, civil rights movement and they're going to use it to bust open the sovereignty of this nation.
[00:20:01.613 --> 00:20:03.614]  Gee, honey, your feet look great in those sandals.
[00:20:03.754 --> 00:20:04.095]  Thanks.
[00:20:04.355 --> 00:20:06.596]  Last summer, I was too embarrassed by my nails to wear them.
[00:20:06.716 --> 00:20:08.738]  Well, your toenails sure look clear and healthy now.
[00:20:08.858 --> 00:20:10.239]  Makes me feel terrible about mine.
[00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:11.239]  See, this one looks thick.
[00:20:11.299 --> 00:20:12.140]  That one's yellow.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.081]  What you need is Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:20:14.201 --> 00:20:17.363]  Nonex clears out the buildup that discolors toenails and fingernails.
[00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:18.784]  It's called keratin debris.
[00:20:18.944 --> 00:20:20.185]  Just apply Nonex daily.
[00:20:20.265 --> 00:20:22.306]  And I'll have clear, healthy-looking toenails?
[00:20:22.546 --> 00:20:23.347]  Just look at mine.
[00:20:23.367 --> 00:20:25.969]  A diatrist-recommended Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:31.012]  Now at Walgreens, Longs, Eckerd Pharmacy, Rite Aid, and Brooks Pharmacy in the foot care section.
[00:20:32.952 --> 00:20:33.973]  Looking for profits?
[00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:35.414]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:20:35.674 --> 00:20:38.956]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:20:39.016 --> 00:20:46.262]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:20:46.642 --> 00:20:50.164]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:20:50.405 --> 00:20:51.926]  Secure your position today.
[00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:53.427]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.487 --> 00:20:53.727]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.066 --> 00:21:02.606]  We're good to go.
[00:21:29.462 --> 00:21:30.123]  We're good to go.
[00:22:03.846 --> 00:22:04.887]  The war on terrorism.
[00:22:05.207 --> 00:22:07.988]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:08.248 --> 00:22:12.411]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:13.671]  So what do you do?
[00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:18.554]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:19.034 --> 00:22:21.156]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:22:21.656 --> 00:22:36.349]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:43.455]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:48.219]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:23:02.791 --> 00:23:05.233]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:05.833 --> 00:23:19.884]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?
[00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:29.851]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:32.248 --> 00:23:32.708]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[00:23:37.473 --> 00:23:37.693]  It's free.
[00:23:37.713 --> 00:23:39.915]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[00:24:06.331 --> 00:24:08.233]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:11.475]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:20.843 --> 00:24:28.025]  Again, Allen set up a phony human rights front group called Democracy Watch, supposedly to monitor elections in Mexico.
[00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:33.526]  The group solicited donations and used the money to illegally sway the Mexican election in favor of Vicente Fox.
[00:24:33.566 --> 00:24:34.466]  That's the LA Times.
[00:24:35.486 --> 00:24:38.467]  So understand, these guys overthrow governments.
[00:24:38.507 --> 00:24:41.548]  These people get politicians elected.
[00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:43.688]  This is hardcore propaganda.
[00:24:45.402 --> 00:25:04.116]  The scenes you will witness on the streets of America over the next few days do not illustrate a new civil rights movement but an invading army of militant foreigners bankrolled and supported by predominantly white rich neocons and neolibs who are using the different Mexican race groups as a vice to crush the sleeping American middle class.
[00:25:04.897 --> 00:25:11.322]  The real agenda embraced by the ringleaders of the protest are still being whitewashed and covered up by the mainstream media.
[00:25:12.017 --> 00:25:26.800]  The demonstrators are part of an orchestrated advance on the part of a race hate movement that seeks to enact a brutal program of ethnic cleansing that will wipe uncooperative whites and blacks from the South and Southwestern states of the map as detailed in our previous article.
[00:25:27.552 --> 00:25:34.595]  The Aslan Movement openly states its goal is to create a separatist state that encompasses the entire southern and western states.
[00:25:35.515 --> 00:25:46.799]  Their version of Hitler's Mein Kampf is the Plan of San Diego, which was actually German finance, by the way, which outlines the plan to ethnically cleanse the entire region of whites and blacks by mass genocide.
[00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:49.740]  Metsch's own slogan reads, For the race, everything.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.421]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:25:52.927 --> 00:25:57.931]  And the head of Chicano Studies up at UT Arlington has stated all whites must die now.
[00:25:58.031 --> 00:26:00.973]  He's not just saying all whites, 16 and older white males.
[00:26:02.114 --> 00:26:13.904]  The catalyst for the agenda to intern millions of Americans deemed subversive in a time of manufactured chaos could be race riots kick-started by radicalizing Mexican plan groups and their establishment controllers.
[00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:20.209]  During our reporting on the immigration protests that are a front for the violent...
[00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:22.751]  Separate as Ozlon Movement.
[00:26:23.816 --> 00:26:36.385]  Watching Spanish TV news stations, we were able to ascertain that the marchers were not wholly an organic response to the introduction of an immigration bill, but were being artificially promoted and organized by the Spanish language media.
[00:26:36.905 --> 00:26:51.896]  The very next day, the Associated Press reported that as many as 500,000 people who crammed downtown Los Angeles on Saturday to protest legislation that would make criminals out of illegal immigrants learned where, when, and even how to demonstrate from the Spanish language media.
[00:26:53.007 --> 00:26:56.728]  For English-speaking America, the mass protests in Los Angeles and other U.S.
[00:26:56.768 --> 00:27:01.609]  cities over the past few days have been surprising for their size and seeming spontaneity.
[00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:03.349]  This is from the AP.
[00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:12.070]  But they were organized, promoted, and publicized for weeks by Spanish-language radio hosts and TV anchors as a demonstration of Hispanic pride and power.
[00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:18.852]  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertop dismissed concerns of repeated incursions on U.S.
[00:27:18.892 --> 00:27:20.912]  soil by Mexican military and drug runners.
[00:27:22.088 --> 00:27:25.890]  Calling claims of border war scare tactics.
[00:27:26.031 --> 00:27:28.872]  Yeah, the State Department just says it's more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel.
[00:27:29.933 --> 00:27:39.679]  Over the past few years, there have been hundreds of incidents of rocket attacks, drive-by shootings, murders of sheriffs and police chiefs, and abductions of U.S.
[00:27:39.719 --> 00:27:40.239]  citizens.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.943]  If Al-Qaeda was engaging in this kind of behavior, it would be all over the front pages without recourse.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:54.062]  Sheriff Rick Flores, whose jurisdiction includes vast swaths of the southern border, told the London Telegraph last week, yeah, it's a war.
[00:27:54.942 --> 00:27:57.463]  These people are sophisticated and they are organized.
[00:27:57.503 --> 00:28:00.764]  They wear body armor and helmets, just like our soldiers in Iraq.
[00:28:00.984 --> 00:28:05.005]  They have no respect for life and are not afraid of law enforcement on this side.
[00:28:05.672 --> 00:28:17.337]  The National Executive Director of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps, Al Garza, calls the southern border a war zone and says that areas of south Texas and Arizona are more dangerous per capita than Israel's West Bank.
[00:28:17.377 --> 00:28:18.038]  He repeated that.
[00:28:18.558 --> 00:28:19.739]  We are virtually at war.
[00:28:19.979 --> 00:28:22.220]  We should, in fact, deploy our military to the borders.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:31.344]  You do that and you will seize all these criminals and all these drug cartels that do what they want to do, Garza told the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:33.797 --> 00:28:50.270]  Continuing, Mexican drug commandos organized Las Zetas have been carrying out kidnappings of American citizens and politically motivated assassinations which have stretched from the border town of Nuevo Laredo through Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, all the way to Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:28:50.691 --> 00:28:52.152]  I would add Indianapolis, Indiana.
[00:28:52.742 --> 00:28:53.502]  Why should the U.S.
[00:28:53.522 --> 00:28:56.924]  government make it easier for drug smuggling death squads to enter the country?
[00:28:57.244 --> 00:28:57.804]  Because the U.S.
[00:28:57.844 --> 00:29:03.647]  government controls Los Santos and uses it as the front group for their narco empire, just like they're staging the demonstrations.
[00:29:04.127 --> 00:29:19.714]  Retired DEA agent Sulla Costello III served 12 years in the Drug Enforcement Agency, where he built cases against organized drug rings in Manhattan, raided jungle cocaine lambs in the Amazon, conducted aerial eradication operations in Guatemala, and assembled and trained anti-narcotics units in several countries.
[00:29:20.154 --> 00:29:24.655]  Costello affirms the truth is that they are still working for the U.S.
[00:29:24.715 --> 00:29:28.516]  government in protecting drug routes to keep the wheels of Wall Street oil.
[00:29:28.856 --> 00:29:33.398]  Costello has gone on the record to state that the commandos are working directly for the U.S.
[00:29:33.458 --> 00:29:38.139]  government drug cartel in carrying out hits on rival drug smugglers who aren't paying their cut.
[00:29:39.648 --> 00:29:40.729]  We're on the march.
[00:29:40.809 --> 00:29:41.750]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:43.332]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.512 --> 00:30:05.634]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:30:05.894 --> 00:30:12.699]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:30:13.139 --> 00:30:26.508]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:30:26.808 --> 00:30:30.551]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:31.179]  Thank you.
[00:31:02.176 --> 00:31:02.797]  We're good to go.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.041]  We're good to go.
[00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:54.322]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:01.908 --> 00:32:05.971]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:06.171 --> 00:32:09.574]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.754 --> 00:32:13.157]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:13.487 --> 00:32:16.729]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.749 --> 00:32:22.213]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:32:22.253 --> 00:32:31.880]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.321]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:38.805]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:39.285 --> 00:32:43.751]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:43.811 --> 00:32:45.172]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[00:32:56.771 --> 00:32:59.312]  This is Schindler's, whose daughter, Terri Shadow Schindler...
[00:33:23.428 --> 00:33:27.971]  I'm going to go ahead and play the entirety of Colbert's speech, the host of Comedy Central's Colbert Report.
[00:33:27.991 --> 00:33:31.193]  Colbert does the White House Correspondents Dinner.
[00:33:41.374 --> 00:33:56.389]  Stephen Colbert spoke tonight at the dinner in Lampoon, this was a few days ago, pretty much everything he could think of, and Helen Thomas, I think the second half of this performance, because it includes the General Scalia, the press briefing, and the EMP reported.
[00:33:56.589 --> 00:34:00.953]  Again, this is a clip, this is just part of it, from Crooks and Liars.
[00:34:01.374 --> 00:34:04.697]  Here's the article reporting on it from the Associated Press.
[00:34:06.013 --> 00:34:22.375]  Colbert Lampoon's Bush and White House Correspondents Dinner, President Not Amused, a blistering comedy tribute to President Bush by Comedy Central's talk show host Stephen Colbert at the White House Correspondents Dinner Saturday night left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close.
[00:34:23.056 --> 00:34:31.364]  Earlier, the President had delivered his talk to the 2,700 attendees, including many celebrities and top officials, with the help of a Bush impersonator.
[00:34:31.764 --> 00:34:41.633]  Colbert, who spoke in the guise of a talk show character who ostensibly supports the President strongly, urged Bush to ignore his low approval rating, saying that they were...
[00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:45.998]  Based on reality, and reality has a well-known liberal bias.
[00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:52.447]  So again, even though Colbert is saying a lot of things that are true, he acts like the liberals are basically going to save everybody.
[00:34:53.128 --> 00:34:54.250]  He's sarcastic about it.
[00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:57.895]  No, the Democratic Party is almost completely, 100% on board with Bush.
[00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:06.743]  He attacked those in the press who claimed that the shake-up at the White House was merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.
[00:35:07.083 --> 00:35:09.866]  He said, this administration is soaring, not sinking, he said.
[00:35:10.226 --> 00:35:13.969]  If anything, they are rearranging the deck chairs on the Hindenburg.
[00:35:14.549 --> 00:35:27.860]  Speaking of the famous airship filled with hydrogen that exploded over the U.S., Colbert told Bush that he could end the problem of protest by retired generals by refusing to let them retire.
[00:35:28.439 --> 00:35:35.243]  He compared Bush to Rocky Balboa in the Rocky movies, always getting punched in the face, and Apollo Creed is everything else in the world.
[00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:46.850]  He went on to say, turning to the war, he declared, I believe that the government that governs best is a government that governs least, and by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq.
[00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.792]  But enough of Alex Jones reading some of these one-liners.
[00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:52.733]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:35:52.893 --> 00:35:57.056]  This is Colbert from the White House Correspondents Dinner over the weekend.
[00:36:00.563 --> 00:36:02.124]  Isn't that an exciting clip, folks?
[00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:05.587]  John, do you feel like playing that for me?
[00:36:05.647 --> 00:36:08.809]  Are we going to roll that clip?
[00:36:11.471 --> 00:36:20.978]  As excited as I am to be here with the President, I am appalled to be surrounded by the liberal media that is destroying America.
[00:36:21.318 --> 00:36:22.679]  With the exception of Fox News.
[00:36:25.101 --> 00:36:27.403]  Fox News gives you both sides of every story.
[00:36:27.863 --> 00:36:28.824]  The President's side...
[00:36:29.841 --> 00:36:31.181]  And the Vice President's side.
[00:36:34.482 --> 00:36:36.002]  But the rest of you, what are you thinking?
[00:36:37.003 --> 00:36:40.964]  Reporting on NSA wiretapping or secret prisons in Eastern Europe?
[00:36:41.924 --> 00:36:45.405]  Those things are secret for a very important reason.
[00:36:45.945 --> 00:36:47.545]  They're super depressing.
[00:36:49.106 --> 00:36:51.326]  And if that's your goal, well, misery accomplished.
[00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:55.787]  Over the last five years, you people were so good.
[00:36:56.927 --> 00:36:57.688]  Over tax cuts.
[00:37:00.269 --> 00:37:01.330]  WMD intelligence?
[00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.871]  The effects of global warming?
[00:37:03.211 --> 00:37:07.273]  We Americans didn't want to know and you had the courtesy not to try to find out.
[00:37:08.734 --> 00:37:09.775]  Those were good times.
[00:37:10.975 --> 00:37:11.776]  As far as we knew.
[00:37:14.297 --> 00:37:15.858]  But listen, let's review the rules.
[00:37:15.898 --> 00:37:16.579]  Here's how it works.
[00:37:17.179 --> 00:37:19.040]  The president makes decisions.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.161]  He's the decider.
[00:37:22.518 --> 00:37:27.762]  The press secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down.
[00:37:28.462 --> 00:37:29.963]  Make, announce, type.
[00:37:30.063 --> 00:37:32.305]  Just put them through a spell check and go home.
[00:37:33.625 --> 00:37:34.746]  Get to know your family again.
[00:37:35.006 --> 00:37:36.147]  Make love to your wife.
[00:37:37.328 --> 00:37:39.549]  Write that novel you got kicking around in your head.
[00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:45.834]  You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration?
[00:37:45.854 --> 00:37:47.675]  You know, fiction!
[00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:59.752]  Because really, what incentive do these people have to answer your questions after all?
[00:38:00.713 --> 00:38:02.534]  I mean, nothing satisfies you.
[00:38:03.054 --> 00:38:04.735]  Everybody asks for personnel changes.
[00:38:05.195 --> 00:38:07.816]  So, the White House has personnel changes.
[00:38:08.176 --> 00:38:12.598]  And then you write, oh, they're just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.
[00:38:13.618 --> 00:38:15.619]  First of all, that is a terrible metaphor.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.661]  This administration is not sinking.
[00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:21.942]  This administration is soaring.
[00:38:22.825 --> 00:38:26.566]  If anything, they are rearranging the deck chairs on the Hindenburg.
[00:38:35.128 --> 00:38:37.128]  Now, it's not all bad guys out there.
[00:38:37.308 --> 00:38:38.708]  There are some of the heroes out there tonight.
[00:38:38.728 --> 00:38:41.609]  Christopher Buckley, Jeff Sachs, Ken Burns, Bob Schieffer.
[00:38:41.949 --> 00:38:42.789]  I've interviewed all of them.
[00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:45.770]  By the way, Mr. President, thank you for agreeing to be on my show.
[00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:47.070]  I appreciate it.
[00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.611]  I was just as shocked as everyone here is.
[00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:51.471]  I promise you.
[00:38:52.506 --> 00:38:53.367]  How's Tuesday for you?
[00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:56.649]  I've got Frank Rich, but we can just bump him.
[00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.171]  I mean, bump him.
[00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:02.113]  I know a guy.
[00:39:02.193 --> 00:39:02.733]  Say the word.
[00:39:03.433 --> 00:39:09.978]  Let's see who we got here tonight.
[00:39:10.058 --> 00:39:12.960]  We've got General Mosley, Air Force Chief of Staff.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.662]  We've got General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:39:16.042 --> 00:39:17.623]  They still support Rumsfeld.
[00:39:18.824 --> 00:39:20.045]  Right, you guys aren't retired yet, right?
[00:39:21.713 --> 00:39:21.913]  Right.
[00:39:21.973 --> 00:39:23.674]  They still support Rumsfeld.
[00:39:26.095 --> 00:39:29.957]  Look, by the way, I've got a theory about how to handle these retired generals.
[00:39:30.217 --> 00:39:31.157]  I've caused all this trouble.
[00:39:31.878 --> 00:39:33.038]  Don't let them retire.
[00:39:34.699 --> 00:39:35.259]  Come on.
[00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:36.620]  We've got a stop-loss program.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.940]  Let's use it on these guys.
[00:39:38.901 --> 00:39:41.422]  I've seen the zinni in that crowd on Wolf Blitzer.
[00:39:41.502 --> 00:39:46.924]  If you're strong enough to go on one of those pundit shows, you're strong enough to stand on a bank of computers and order men into battle.
[00:39:47.605 --> 00:39:48.085]  Come on.
[00:39:55.117 --> 00:39:56.097]  Jesse Jackson is here.
[00:39:56.858 --> 00:39:57.258]  The Reverend.
[00:39:57.278 --> 00:39:58.838]  Haven't heard from the Reverend in just a little while.
[00:39:59.499 --> 00:40:00.299]  I had him on the show.
[00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:01.319]  Very interesting interview.
[00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:03.240]  Very challenging interview.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:09.383]  You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants at the pace that he wants.
[00:40:09.403 --> 00:40:11.924]  It's like boxing a glacier.
[00:40:14.345 --> 00:40:17.766]  Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is.
[00:40:24.747 --> 00:40:26.288]  Justice Scalia is here.
[00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:30.012]  Justice Scalia, may I be the first to say, welcome, sir!
[00:40:31.673 --> 00:40:33.174]  You look fantastic!
[00:40:33.975 --> 00:40:35.456]  How are you?
[00:40:43.163 --> 00:40:44.865]  Stalking some Sicilian with my fives on.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.020]  John McCain is here.
[00:40:54.681 --> 00:40:56.181]  John McCain, what a maverick.
[00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.542]  Somebody find out what fork he used on his salad.
[00:41:00.582 --> 00:41:02.583]  Because I guarantee you it wasn't a salad fork.
[00:41:03.643 --> 00:41:04.804]  This guy could have used a spoon.
[00:41:04.824 --> 00:41:05.764]  There's no predicting him.
[00:41:08.325 --> 00:41:12.206]  By the way, Senator McCain, it's so wonderful to see you coming back into the Republican fold.
[00:41:12.646 --> 00:41:14.306]  I've actually got a summer house in South Carolina.
[00:41:14.567 --> 00:41:16.747]  Look me up when you go to speak at Bob Jones University.
[00:41:17.868 --> 00:41:19.248]  So glad you've seen the light, sir.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.681]  Mayor Nagin!
[00:41:23.301 --> 00:41:25.923]  Mayor Nagin is here from New Orleans, the chocolate city!
[00:41:27.525 --> 00:41:28.185]  Yeah, give it up!
[00:41:29.847 --> 00:41:36.633]  Mayor Nagin, I'd like to welcome you to Washington, D.C., the chocolate city with a marshmallow center.
[00:41:37.093 --> 00:41:39.995]  And a graham cracker crust of corruption.
[00:41:48.064 --> 00:41:49.805]  It's a Malamar, I guess is what I'm describing.
[00:41:49.865 --> 00:41:50.525]  It's a Malamar.
[00:41:50.846 --> 00:41:51.946]  It's a seasonal cookie.
[00:41:54.488 --> 00:41:55.488]  Joe Wilson is here.
[00:41:55.768 --> 00:41:57.529]  Joe Wilson right down here in front.
[00:41:57.549 --> 00:41:59.611]  The most famous husband since Desi Arnaz.
[00:42:05.114 --> 00:42:07.515]  And of course he brought along his lovely wife Valerie Plame.
[00:42:07.835 --> 00:42:08.696]  Oh my God!
[00:42:12.328 --> 00:42:13.549]  Oh, what have I said?
[00:42:13.569 --> 00:42:16.410]  Aye, G. Minetti.
[00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:17.691]  I am sorry, Mr. President.
[00:42:17.731 --> 00:42:21.873]  I meant to say he brought along his lovely wife, Joe Wilson's wife.
[00:42:23.854 --> 00:42:25.234]  Patrick Fitzgerald's not here tonight, right?
[00:42:25.734 --> 00:42:26.995]  Okay, dodged a bullet.
[00:42:28.616 --> 00:42:35.539]  And of course, we can't forget, man of the hour, new press secretary, Tony Snow.
[00:42:35.679 --> 00:42:37.200]  Secret Service name, Snowjob.
[00:42:41.101 --> 00:42:41.882]  Toughest job.
[00:42:41.902 --> 00:42:42.402]  What a hero.
[00:42:42.422 --> 00:42:47.947]  Took the second toughest job in government next to, of course, the ambassador to Iraq.
[00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.672]  Got some big shoes to fill, Tony.
[00:42:52.792 --> 00:42:53.713]  Big shoes to fill.
[00:42:54.213 --> 00:42:57.316]  Scott McClellan could say nothing like nobody else.
[00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:02.421]  McClellan, of course, eager to retire.
[00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:06.965]  Really, really felt like he needed to spend more time with Andrew Card's children.
[00:43:11.605 --> 00:43:14.586]  Mr. President, I wish you hadn't made the decision so quickly, sir.
[00:43:14.886 --> 00:43:16.626]  I was vying for the job myself.
[00:43:17.427 --> 00:43:19.167]  I think I would have made a fabulous press secretary.
[00:43:19.187 --> 00:43:21.087]  I have nothing but contempt for these people.
[00:43:23.568 --> 00:43:25.049]  I know how to handle these clowns.
[00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:29.610]  In fact, sir, I brought along an audition tape.
[00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:34.231]  And with your indulgence, I'd like to at least give it a shot.
[00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:38.312]  So, ladies and gentlemen, my press conference.
[00:43:51.431 --> 00:43:52.452]  I have a brief statement.
[00:43:53.592 --> 00:43:55.494]  The press is destroying America.
[00:43:58.495 --> 00:43:59.816]  Okay, let's see who we got here today.
[00:44:00.897 --> 00:44:01.317]  Stretch.
[00:44:03.539 --> 00:44:04.499]  Sir Nerdlington.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.081]  Sloppy Joe.
[00:44:09.102 --> 00:44:11.304]  Terry Lemon Moran Pie.
[00:44:13.105 --> 00:44:13.425]  Dope.
[00:44:14.425 --> 00:44:16.147]  Doubting Thomas, always a pleasure.
[00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:19.469]  And Suzanne Mal, hello!
[00:44:25.356 --> 00:44:25.556]  Yes.
[00:44:25.936 --> 00:44:29.519]  Will the Vice President be available soon to answer all questions himself?
[00:44:29.939 --> 00:44:30.820]  I've already addressed that question.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:31.440]  You.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.962]  Walter Cronkite denoted CBS anchor.
[00:44:35.202 --> 00:44:37.744]  Ah, no, he's the former CBS anchor.
[00:44:38.084 --> 00:44:41.166]  Katie Couric is the anchor of the CBS Evening News.
[00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:43.608]  Wait, wait, how do you guys feel about that?
[00:44:44.088 --> 00:44:45.729]  You tousled hair, guy in the back.
[00:44:46.129 --> 00:44:48.671]  Are you happy about Katie Couric taking over the CBS Evening News?
[00:44:49.331 --> 00:44:50.052]  No, sir, Mr. Colbert.
[00:44:50.092 --> 00:44:50.312]  Are you?
[00:44:50.332 --> 00:44:50.372]  No.
[00:44:54.702 --> 00:44:56.203]  Oh, look, we all came to Gregorio.
[00:44:56.884 --> 00:44:57.824]  David, do you have a question?
[00:44:58.345 --> 00:44:59.565]  Did Karl Rove commit a crime?
[00:44:59.946 --> 00:45:00.466]  I don't know.
[00:45:00.486 --> 00:45:00.966]  I'll ask him.
[00:45:01.827 --> 00:45:03.288]  Karl, pay attention, please.
[00:45:07.211 --> 00:45:19.899]  Do you stand by your statement from the fall of 2003 when you were asked specifically about Karl and Elliot Abrams and Scooter Libby and you said, I've gone to each of those gentlemen and they have told me they are not involved in this?
[00:45:19.939 --> 00:45:21.220]  Do you stand by that statement?
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.121]  Nah, I was just kidding.
[00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:23.381]  No, you're not finishing.
[00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:24.262]  You're not saying anything.
[00:45:24.662 --> 00:45:27.022]  You sit at that podium and say... Ah, that's where you're wrong.
[00:45:27.382 --> 00:45:28.083]  New podium.
[00:45:28.423 --> 00:45:29.583]  Just had it delivered today.
[00:45:30.143 --> 00:45:31.464]  Get your facts straight, David.
[00:45:31.504 --> 00:45:32.224]  This is ridiculous.
[00:45:32.624 --> 00:45:40.306]  The notion that you're going to stand before us after having commented with that level of detail and tell people watching this that somehow you've decided not to talk.
[00:45:40.586 --> 00:45:42.567]  You've got to... I'm sorry, what's that, David?
[00:45:45.175 --> 00:45:48.096]  If I can't hear you, I can't answer your question.
[00:45:48.116 --> 00:45:48.716]  I'm sorry.
[00:45:48.896 --> 00:45:49.757]  I have to move on.
[00:45:49.957 --> 00:45:50.137]  Yeah.
[00:45:50.577 --> 00:45:50.957]  Terry.
[00:45:51.557 --> 00:46:05.542]  After the investigation began, after the criminal investigation was underway, you said... All of a sudden you have respect for the sanctity of the criminal investigation?
[00:46:05.982 --> 00:46:09.243]  No, I never had any respect for the sanctity of a criminal investigation.
[00:46:09.563 --> 00:46:10.303]  Activist judges.
[00:46:10.603 --> 00:46:11.183]  Yes, Helen.
[00:46:11.444 --> 00:46:12.404]  You're going to be sorry.
[00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:19.348]  Whatcha gonna do, Helen?
[00:46:19.669 --> 00:46:21.250]  Ask me for a recipe?
[00:46:22.691 --> 00:46:27.696]  Your decision to invade Iraq has caused the deaths of thousands of Americans and Iraqis.
[00:46:28.336 --> 00:46:32.120]  Wounds of Americans and Iraqis for a lifetime.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:37.144]  Every reason given, publicly at least, has turned out not to be true.
[00:46:37.184 --> 00:46:40.567]  My question is, why did you really want to go to war?
[00:46:40.988 --> 00:46:42.209]  Helen, I'm gonna stop you right there.
[00:46:42.289 --> 00:46:42.950]  That's enough.
[00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.950]  No.
[00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.171]  Sorry, Helen, I'm moving on.
[00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:47.252]  Guys, no, I already said no!
[00:46:47.272 --> 00:46:51.975]  Guys, guys, please don't let Helen do this to what was a lovely day.
[00:47:06.382 --> 00:47:07.122]  No, no, no!
[00:47:07.323 --> 00:47:09.623]  I'm not listening to you!
[00:47:09.663 --> 00:47:10.824]  Look what you did, Alan!
[00:47:10.964 --> 00:47:11.924]  I hate you!
[00:47:11.944 --> 00:47:13.405]  Get out of here!
[00:47:13.465 --> 00:47:14.965]  There is a wall here!
[00:47:27.268 --> 00:47:32.309]  And then he basically gets chased around by the White House press corps in this little skit he did.
[00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:33.149]  It's pretty hilarious.
[00:47:33.169 --> 00:47:37.630]  You can watch it up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:39.671]  We're going to break here in a minute or two.
[00:47:39.691 --> 00:47:45.052]  When we get back, I want to get into some really serious news, shifting gears from the Associated Press.
[00:47:45.612 --> 00:47:49.333]  Bird flu hitting TV screens May 9th.
[00:47:52.254 --> 00:47:54.134]  And listen to the first few paragraphs.
[00:47:56.503 --> 00:48:00.647]  Bodies piling up so quickly it takes dump trucks to haul them away.
[00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:04.331]  Barbed wire to keep whole neighborhoods quarantined.
[00:48:04.971 --> 00:48:14.000]  It's Hollywood's version of bird flu, a blur of fact and fiction that some scientists say could confuse the public.
[00:48:14.581 --> 00:48:18.665]  Well, I'll tell you what's behind this after we get back from break, but before we do break...
[00:48:20.322 --> 00:48:46.762]  I want to encourage all listeners of this radio broadcast, whether you're listening on an AM or FM station, global shortwave, the internet, satellite, I want to encourage you to go to our secure online shopping cart at the video and bookstore on Infowars.com and to look at all the videos and books that I have produced, that I have written, that we carry by other wonderful authors.
[00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:59.577]  To take advantage of some of the discounts that we have available, you can get some of my films for as low as $5.95 apiece when you get multiple copies of other documentaries.
[00:49:00.577 --> 00:49:07.622]  Or in some cases, you can even get free books or videos when you make bulk orders of just a few documentaries.
[00:49:08.442 --> 00:49:09.963]  We have a lot of different specials.
[00:49:10.003 --> 00:49:10.623]  In fact, there's what?
[00:49:11.044 --> 00:49:11.224]  Now...
[00:49:12.159 --> 00:49:13.280]  There was 14 specials.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:18.503]  Now there's 16 different specials on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:20.044 --> 00:49:20.445]  Go there.
[00:49:20.485 --> 00:49:25.828]  Get Martial Law, 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, the preeminent 9-11 film that I produced last year.
[00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:31.052]  Get the original I made four years ago, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, that some say is still the best.
[00:49:31.912 --> 00:49:32.693]  I think it's excellent.
[00:49:34.142 --> 00:49:37.343]  Go to Infowars.com and get Loose Change, second edition.
[00:49:37.404 --> 00:49:38.484]  You may have seen it online.
[00:49:38.504 --> 00:49:43.826]  We've got a high-quality DVD copy of this amazing 9-11 film that's getting so much attention.
[00:49:44.386 --> 00:49:50.229]  Go to Infowars.com and get the new video we're carrying, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1.
[00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:53.931]  It's so important to understand where we are today.
[00:49:53.971 --> 00:49:55.311]  It's riveting information.
[00:49:55.871 --> 00:49:57.032]  And when you get my videos...
[00:49:58.658 --> 00:49:59.178]  We're good to go.
[00:50:21.738 --> 00:50:24.859]  Give them to your imam, your rabbi, whatever.
[00:50:25.199 --> 00:50:27.240]  Give them to community leaders in your area.
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.941]  Show them at your local college or at the local library.
[00:50:31.321 --> 00:50:33.922]  Do what tens of thousands of other Americans have done.
[00:50:34.283 --> 00:50:34.863]  Get involved.
[00:50:34.883 --> 00:50:35.463]  Take action.
[00:50:36.144 --> 00:50:39.106]  There's also another great activist tool, that's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:39.126 --> 00:50:47.413]  We have monthly and yearly subscriptions available there at PrisonPlanet.tv for 15 cents a day, or get a yearly subscription and you get three months free.
[00:50:47.773 --> 00:50:58.162]  You can download all my films and burn them on the disc, burn them on the DVD, over a thousand pieces of media, over two years up and operating, PrisonPlanet.tv, become a member today.
[00:50:58.622 --> 00:51:00.203]  We'll come back into the bird flu, stay with us.
[00:51:01.969 --> 00:51:03.489]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.669 --> 00:51:06.750]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:10.791]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.831 --> 00:51:15.072]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:15.412 --> 00:51:19.173]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.333 --> 00:51:21.194]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.314 --> 00:51:24.635]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.675 --> 00:51:25.775]  The medical bills.
[00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:29.398]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.539 --> 00:51:32.582]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.762 --> 00:51:35.625]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:36.105 --> 00:51:42.252]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.752 --> 00:51:43.473]  We're good to go.
[00:51:43.493 --> 00:51:43.973]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.981 --> 00:52:05.562]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.582 --> 00:52:06.082]  are located?
[00:52:06.302 --> 00:52:09.683]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:18.681]  Notice, at every level of our society, it's all about crisis.
[00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:19.881]  It's about terror.
[00:54:19.961 --> 00:54:21.482]  It's about you're in danger.
[00:54:22.162 --> 00:54:23.922]  Only the government can save you.
[00:54:24.022 --> 00:54:25.122]  You need the government.
[00:54:25.522 --> 00:54:28.763]  You need to relinquish your liberty and you'll get security.
[00:54:29.663 --> 00:54:33.044]  Why, there's going to be smallpox outbreaks.
[00:54:33.124 --> 00:54:34.264]  It's going to happen.
[00:54:34.324 --> 00:54:36.705]  Remember four years ago, for a full year,
[00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:39.431]  Oh, now SARS.
[00:54:39.491 --> 00:54:41.051]  It's going to kill hundreds of millions.
[00:54:41.131 --> 00:54:42.812]  It could kill billions worldwide.
[00:54:43.372 --> 00:54:44.973]  Oh, it's all over, but don't worry.
[00:54:45.293 --> 00:54:49.734]  Certain defense contractor-controlled drug companies have drugs for you that will save you.
[00:54:50.315 --> 00:54:52.876]  So they also make money off scaring everyone.
[00:54:53.136 --> 00:54:54.936]  And now, oh, it's the bird flu.
[00:54:54.976 --> 00:54:55.556]  It's coming.
[00:54:55.617 --> 00:54:57.097]  It's going to be here by the winter.
[00:54:57.797 --> 00:54:59.138]  The winter of 2005.
[00:54:59.178 --> 00:55:00.438]  It's going to kill everyone.
[00:55:00.498 --> 00:55:02.059]  Three billion humans could die.
[00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:03.659]  Hundreds of millions of Americans.
[00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:04.800]  It's going to happen!
[00:55:06.832 --> 00:55:09.653]  And then we're here on air going, well, if it does, it's going to be the globalists.
[00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:11.474]  They're the ones cooking up all these bio-weapons.
[00:55:11.494 --> 00:55:16.237]  This bird flu isn't even a threat at its current configuration.
[00:55:18.478 --> 00:55:26.061]  I remember six years ago seeing a Nightline piece on ABC where they did drills where smallpox is released.
[00:55:26.441 --> 00:55:33.705]  They used real riot footage from hurricane-ravaged areas and then did the newscast like it was real reports saying,
[00:55:34.346 --> 00:55:38.248]  We've been hit by smallpox, millions are dying, martial law has been declared.
[00:55:38.909 --> 00:55:41.930]  All of this is drilling us and conditioning us to accept it.
[00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.331]  And now they've moved on to bird flu.
[00:55:44.371 --> 00:55:48.454]  And all of this is psychologically preparing us, acclimating us.
[00:55:49.674 --> 00:55:57.238]  So when the globalists really pull this, we've seen 20 different TV programs and news shows over the years telling us how to respond and how to behave.
[00:55:58.599 --> 00:56:01.661]  This is by Andrew Bridges, Associated Press, May 1st.
[00:56:03.152 --> 00:56:05.673]  Bird flu hitting TV screens May 9.
[00:56:05.833 --> 00:56:09.474]  Bodies piling up so quickly it takes dump trucks to haul them all away.
[00:56:10.035 --> 00:56:12.695]  Barb wire to keep whole neighborhoods quarantined.
[00:56:13.196 --> 00:56:15.176]  It's Hollywood's version of bird flu.
[00:56:15.576 --> 00:56:19.738]  A blur of fact and fiction that some scientists say could confuse the public.
[00:56:20.692 --> 00:56:34.498]  Fatal Contact, Bird Flu in America, an ABC made-for-television movie, airs May 9th, just as scientists are to begin testing of wild birds in Alaska that could herald the arrival of bird flu in North America.
[00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:42.101]  Scientists fear that bird flu virus could evolve so it could be passed from human to human, sparking a global pandemic.
[00:56:42.141 --> 00:56:46.323]  Well, even if it does go human to human transmission, it doesn't necessarily mean that'll happen.
[00:56:46.623 --> 00:56:48.344]  That's where most flus come from, is birds.
[00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:49.631]  It's psyops, folks.
[00:56:49.772 --> 00:56:50.112]  It's P.R.
[00:57:15.834 --> 00:57:18.195]  We call this a plausible worst-case scenario.
[00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:19.275]  This could actually happen.
[00:57:19.395 --> 00:57:22.036]  It may not be this bad, but it could be this bad.
[00:57:22.216 --> 00:57:34.260]  See, this way if the globalists pull a bird flu attack, it only kills a few thousand, they can still have the hysteria, the lockdowns, and then say the military lockdown saved us and only a few thousand died.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.541]  Oh, see, then they set the precedent.
[00:57:37.395 --> 00:57:38.116]  We're good to go.
[00:57:58.644 --> 00:58:08.073]  How many years have I told you that before the globalists really release a super bioweapon, they'll have lots of little mini-scares and mini-releases to get the police state in place?
[00:58:08.353 --> 00:58:23.067]  And by letting them put the police state in place, you guarantee that the Malthusian, Dr. Pianca types in government will launch a real attack in America that will kill large numbers of people, including members of your family, possibly even you.
[00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:27.082]  Now, how did I know eight years ago to start talking about this?
[00:58:27.502 --> 00:58:29.202]  Because I read their own battle plans.
[00:58:30.542 --> 00:58:32.063]  I've read their own research papers.
[00:58:32.463 --> 00:58:33.903]  This is what they're engineering.
[00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.343]  This is what they're setting up.
[00:58:36.664 --> 00:58:39.124]  They're going to bring in their world government on the back of this.
[00:58:39.184 --> 00:58:40.204]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.705 --> 00:58:45.606]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.926 --> 00:58:46.746]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.766 --> 00:58:46.906]  Hello?
[00:58:58.255 --> 00:58:58.896]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.556 --> 00:59:00.617]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.317 --> 00:59:02.438]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.099 --> 00:59:03.900]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:05.581]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:10.165]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.405 --> 00:59:14.528]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.548 --> 00:59:15.989]  Music
[00:59:24.091 --> 00:59:27.732]  Terry Schindler Schiavo was over a year ago that she was starved to death.
[00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:29.632]  She was dehydrated.
[00:59:30.512 --> 00:59:40.934]  We'll have her family on with us coming up in the next segment for a report on the aftermath and some of the things they're doing and what Michael Schiavo is doing trying to block their activities with his own foundation.
[00:59:42.595 --> 00:59:43.815]  That is coming up.
[00:59:44.095 --> 00:59:49.976]  And in the third hour, we're going to have Colonel Al Rodriguez, retired decorated war veteran,
[00:59:51.286 --> 00:59:56.549]  With a group that, well, Hispanic Coalition tells illegal alien protesters, you don't speak for me.
[00:59:56.569 --> 01:00:00.270]  And they're having a national press conference on C-SPAN right now.
[01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:02.231]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[01:00:02.551 --> 01:00:03.572]  We'll get back into the border.
[01:00:03.592 --> 01:00:06.253]  A lot of news on Iran and what's happening there.
[01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:07.534]  A lot of news on the economy.
[01:00:08.154 --> 01:00:09.414]  A ton of news on the police state.
[01:00:09.434 --> 01:00:10.175]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:11.221 --> 01:00:17.765]  In the last segment, I was getting into this ABC TV show that AP's reporting on.
[01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:21.307]  Bird flu hits TV screens May 9th.
[01:00:21.767 --> 01:00:25.089]  Bodies piling up so quickly it takes dump trucks to haul them all away.
[01:00:25.529 --> 01:00:27.651]  Barbed wire to keep whole neighborhoods quarantined.
[01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:29.552]  It's Hollywood's version of bird flu.
[01:00:29.572 --> 01:00:33.494]  A blur of fact and fiction that some scientists say could confuse the public.
[01:00:34.114 --> 01:00:38.637]  Remember the Rocky Mountain News four years ago with the governor saying we've got mass crematoriums ready?
[01:00:39.372 --> 01:00:45.155]  Remember all the troops, urban warfare drills where they openly trained to take our guns and put us in camps?
[01:00:45.836 --> 01:00:55.901]  How many sheriff's deputies have I talked to that have been told, even before 9-11, that someday there's going to be a bio-attack and their job's going to be taking our guns because we can't have armed citizens during an emergency?
[01:00:57.963 --> 01:01:05.707]  It'll be armed citizens during an emergency that stop or curtail any rioting or bedlam that ensues.
[01:01:06.812 --> 01:01:10.896]  Just like we saw in the Los Angeles riots of 16 years ago.
[01:01:12.258 --> 01:01:13.199]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:20.306]  At every point of our social strata, of our society, of our civilization these control grids are being put in place.
[01:01:22.139 --> 01:01:37.205]  We have a criminal worldwide elite waging war against free humanity and engineering crises, fostering crises, staging crises, staging terror attacks, threatening biological attacks to herd us into this high-tech control grid.
[01:01:38.065 --> 01:01:39.346]  And we need to wake up to it.
[01:01:39.786 --> 01:01:41.307]  We need to realize what's happening.
[01:01:41.627 --> 01:01:43.808]  We need to resist what's going on.
[01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:47.349]  And we need to have a renaissance of understanding.
[01:01:49.039 --> 01:02:05.925]  Again, the Schindlers are coming up, and speaking of mass extermination, remember Dr. Pianca, UT professor, saying 90% of us need to be killed, need to die, that biological weapons or biological agents are going to do it, and he can't wait for it to start, and he can't wait to go, and for his family to go, and all of this has now been confirmed.
[01:02:06.205 --> 01:02:07.446]  The transcripts have been released.
[01:02:07.486 --> 01:02:09.127]  It was worse than we even first reported.
[01:02:09.527 --> 01:02:11.567]  And then the scary thing was 95% standing ovation.
[01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:14.350]  At St.
[01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:20.094]  Edwards here in Austin, at that private university, and at Lamar University here in Texas as well.
[01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:21.775]  They are the majority.
[01:02:22.295 --> 01:02:24.576]  These are the people working in the bioweapons labs.
[01:02:24.596 --> 01:02:27.818]  These are the people working in the Level 3 and Level 4 labs.
[01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:29.719]  They work for the elite.
[01:02:29.759 --> 01:02:32.961]  The elite have financed and funded the professors that have this view.
[01:02:33.381 --> 01:02:34.542]  They have fostered this view.
[01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:36.503]  They have grown this culture of death view.
[01:02:36.964 --> 01:02:38.404]  And it is a real threat.
[01:02:39.265 --> 01:02:40.125]  But what's it called?
[01:02:40.165 --> 01:02:41.006]  The Cassandra...
[01:02:41.815 --> 01:02:42.716]  We're good to go.
[01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:12.594]  Their psychology.
[01:03:13.555 --> 01:03:20.663]  And it's just horrible to see them setting up all the ducks in a row, gearing this whole thing, selling a culture of death.
[01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:23.226]  It is nightmarish to say the least.
[01:03:23.286 --> 01:03:32.957]  And if we don't have an awakening now, if we don't force this into an open debate,
[01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:36.092]  We're going to wake up dead very, very soon.
[01:03:36.432 --> 01:03:36.913]  Many of us.
[01:03:37.554 --> 01:03:47.868]  And I believe the next few bio-attacks we're going to see are going to be small, create hysteria, and then practice, drill, as a laboratory in the real world, their response and control of the population.
[01:03:48.348 --> 01:03:51.072]  And if those tests are successful, they're going to hit us with the big ones.
[01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.966]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.226 --> 01:03:58.927]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:59.027 --> 01:03:59.807]  Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:04.832]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.173 --> 01:04:11.899]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:14.200]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.241]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.341 --> 01:04:22.003]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.203 --> 01:04:26.604]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.865 --> 01:04:34.067]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.327 --> 01:04:36.748]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:54.742 --> 01:06:00.784]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:02.085]  Globalists are concerned.
[01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:08.296]  We're good to go.
[01:06:33.346 --> 01:06:33.947]  We're good to go.
[01:06:58.408 --> 01:06:59.049]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:00.751]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.472 --> 01:07:02.593]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.234 --> 01:07:04.055]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.816 --> 01:07:05.677]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.697 --> 01:07:10.323]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.563 --> 01:07:14.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:18.311]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:19.292]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:19.332 --> 01:07:20.272]  Central Standard Time.
[01:07:20.312 --> 01:07:22.433]  We're here live and, of course, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:24.454]  We wage war on corruption.
[01:07:24.494 --> 01:07:27.316]  We crash the lies and disinformation.
[01:07:27.356 --> 01:07:40.622]  We expose the global crime syndicate known as the New World Order that controls almost every nation on Earth, both political parties, and is seeking to expand and get a firmer grip on free humanity.
[01:07:42.383 --> 01:08:01.415]  A few months ago, well now, I guess about a month ago, we talked a lot about the Dr. Pianca, UT Austin professor, who got a 95% standing ovation at two separate speeches he gave in Texas, saying he can't wait until airborne Ebola or other bioagents are released to kill the population.
[01:08:01.475 --> 01:08:09.220]  Then we got some of his old speeches where he talks about how he knows his children and his grandchildren and his wife will have to die and that he'll have to go and that he'll willingly do it.
[01:08:10.527 --> 01:08:13.067]  And a lot of his students work in bioweapons labs.
[01:08:13.248 --> 01:08:20.209]  UT runs a level 4 bioweapons lab down in Galveston, Texas, but it only has level 3 containment facilities.
[01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.569]  They've gotten in trouble for that before, but have never stopped doing it.
[01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:31.611]  It's all very, very scary, very, very serious, and that dovetails with Terry Schindler-Scheibe, who died a little over a year ago.
[01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:37.712]  One of the most horrible deaths you can go through, dehydration, and they also have held food from her.
[01:08:38.453 --> 01:08:49.181]  And I know most of you are familiar with that story, but now in the last year there have been a lot of new developments, and her family has started the Terry Schindler Schiavo Foundation.
[01:08:49.882 --> 01:08:59.749]  And Robert Schindler, her father, joins us to talk about the new foundation, what they're going through, what Michael Cockroach Schiavo is up to as usual.
[01:09:00.675 --> 01:09:02.616]  Mr. Schindler, good to have you on with us.
[01:09:02.636 --> 01:09:03.777]  Thank you very much for having me.
[01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:05.398]  It's been a while since we had you on.
[01:09:05.438 --> 01:09:09.601]  For those that have been hiding under a rock or don't remember, a year is a long time.
[01:09:21.352 --> 01:09:26.477]  We just had the anniversary a few weeks ago of your daughter's brutal murder, death.
[01:09:27.117 --> 01:09:32.082]  Please, sir, recap what happened for people, and then let's get into some of the new developments.
[01:09:33.383 --> 01:09:40.309]  Well, Harry, you know, she suspiciously collapsed, a young girl, 25 years old.
[01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:46.034]  And from that, her husband was her guardian.
[01:09:47.126 --> 01:09:58.949]  Went to court, sued her doctor on the premise that she was mistreated medically that could have led to her collapse.
[01:10:00.049 --> 01:10:09.151]  Won a $1.6 million malpractice lawsuit that was supposedly to go to Terry's rehabilitation.
[01:10:09.991 --> 01:10:14.932]  And instead of doing that, he made a couple attempts really to murder her.
[01:10:16.232 --> 01:10:33.242]  By denying her the proper antibiotics when she was ill, and then eventually hired a euthanasia attorney to proceed to end her life based on a verbal hearsay, end-of-life declaration that she allegedly made.
[01:10:33.502 --> 01:10:43.347]  And the judge in the case, Judge Greer, accepted everything that was presented to him as credible, and there was so much perjured testimony, it was ludicrous.
[01:10:43.548 --> 01:10:43.848]  And then...
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:52.787]  Eventually, they removed Terri's hydration and feeding, and she died a horrific death after 13 days.
[01:10:53.247 --> 01:11:13.304]  Now, sir, again, Robert Schindler, father of Terri Schindler Shivo, many, many times they would pull her feeding tube, pull her water, and then there would be 10, 12 days of her not having food and water, and then it would get reinserted, reinstated,
[01:11:14.188 --> 01:11:16.989]  And this went on for several years, of course.
[01:11:17.029 --> 01:11:24.050]  The Genesis Network championed your cause for a full year and a half, long before the national media finally picked up on it.
[01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:29.291]  Then, of course, it became one of the biggest stories in modern media history, as big as the O.J.
[01:11:29.331 --> 01:11:30.111]  Simpson trial.
[01:11:30.651 --> 01:11:34.692]  Even mainstream news has said that it was as big for that six-month period.
[01:11:34.732 --> 01:11:36.253]  Now they'd like everybody to forget about it.
[01:11:36.313 --> 01:11:38.153]  But in that whole national debate,
[01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:40.231]  It never really came out.
[01:11:40.571 --> 01:11:50.354]  The media didn't want to discuss the facts that he, in court when they sued, said she wanted to live, he wanted to rehabilitate her, he wanted to take care of her.
[01:11:50.954 --> 01:11:59.676]  So see, he said this, and then as soon as he got the money, he said, oh, she didn't want to be resuscitated, she wants to die, clearly just wanting that money.
[01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.497]  Alex, if I could interrupt you, it's even worse than that.
[01:12:03.035 --> 01:12:07.739]  And when he got the money is when he tried to deny her the medication, the antibiotics.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.802]  And that's when he had them close the windows for years.
[01:12:10.842 --> 01:12:14.505]  That's when he wouldn't let her get any, you know, even her teeth brushed.
[01:12:14.945 --> 01:12:15.826]  I mean, this is torture.
[01:12:16.206 --> 01:12:31.299]  What he did was he waited four years to go in the court to have her feeding halted because of the statute of limitations expired on the fraud in the malpractice suit.
[01:12:32.335 --> 01:13:01.316]  So there was a four year period of time where he did not really instigate any kind of court action because if he would have they would have got him for fraud at the malpractice trial so he waited until that time elapsed then he went into the court and brought in this evidence that was just ludicrous and the judge who was obviously a pro-death judge just put a stamp of approval on everything and Terry was
[01:13:02.009 --> 01:13:14.879]  Unfortunately, what she endured in that period of time, as you said, she was locked in her room in solitary confinement with the shades drawn and the abuse that she took at a hospice facility.
[01:13:14.939 --> 01:13:17.421]  Now, not all hospice facilities are banned.
[01:13:17.862 --> 01:13:22.125]  Bob, let me interject something here because I've never really heard you ask this question.
[01:13:22.165 --> 01:13:22.886]  You may have been.
[01:13:22.906 --> 01:13:24.227]  I know it's hard for you to talk about.
[01:13:24.527 --> 01:13:27.129]  You fought for her life valiantly for over a decade.
[01:13:28.025 --> 01:13:28.986]  I think we're good to go.
[01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:49.898]  You know, save her from that.
[01:13:49.998 --> 01:13:57.504]  Was it not at any level, though, a relief to know that at least she is not in the clutches of these people now and is with her Lord and Savior?
[01:13:57.864 --> 01:13:58.604]  Well, of course.
[01:13:58.624 --> 01:14:07.271]  You know, that was the only consolation we had when she passed away was that her suffering had ended because she was being abused.
[01:14:07.491 --> 01:14:14.536]  And like you mentioned, her teeth were rotting in her mouth and she was not getting any kind of proper care.
[01:14:14.596 --> 01:14:18.159]  She was looked at as something that was disposable.
[01:14:19.006 --> 01:14:31.433]  And you mentioned, I listened to your intro, about the euthanasia movement in this country, and people have absolutely no idea of what is happening in these hospitals.
[01:14:31.453 --> 01:14:37.316]  What did you think of Dr. Pianka, the UT professor, when you heard him go public saying, 90% of us need to die?
[01:14:37.936 --> 01:14:41.258]  Well, it's in harmony with what these other people were saying.
[01:14:41.278 --> 01:14:42.138]  Look at Peter Singer.
[01:14:42.158 --> 01:14:45.360]  He's a bioethicist out of Princeton.
[01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:56.640]  And they're having a bioethics symposium today in Philadelphia where Judge George Greer, the one that killed Terry, is speaking along with Michael Schiavo.
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.321]  I mean, they're the guest speakers.
[01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:03.122]  Now, how in the world isn't that a conflict of some type of interest?
[01:15:03.983 --> 01:15:12.225]  That doesn't indicate exactly what the harmony was in this case between him and Schiavo.
[01:15:12.265 --> 01:15:13.506]  I mean, the whole thing was a farce.
[01:15:14.668 --> 01:15:25.132]  This judge has been honored throughout Florida by all the different legal communities for his valor in carrying out the death sentence.
[01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:26.933]  Yeah, they're like rock stars now.
[01:15:27.033 --> 01:15:31.834]  In fact, Bob, I did this a little over a year ago when she succumbed to the torture.
[01:15:32.315 --> 01:15:36.456]  Let's just have ten seconds of silence for your daughter right now.
[01:15:36.516 --> 01:15:37.437]  Is that okay if we do that?
[01:15:37.917 --> 01:15:38.477]  Yeah, certainly.
[01:15:38.497 --> 01:15:43.799]  Let's just have ten seconds of silence for her and think about her and all the others that have been murdered in a similar fashion.
[01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:05.672]  Because in this modern world we never really stop and just think.
[01:16:08.468 --> 01:16:15.191]  And for so many Americans who heard the mainstream media twist and spin what was really happening, what was that like for you, Bob?
[01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:17.632]  Because I'm not just choosing sides in this case.
[01:16:17.972 --> 01:16:21.873]  I didn't go, well, I'm with Bob Schindler and Mrs. Schindler and Terry Schindler.
[01:16:21.893 --> 01:16:23.174]  She shouldn't even be called Shivo.
[01:16:23.214 --> 01:16:26.995]  He basically divorced her and went and remarried the whole time this was happening.
[01:16:27.696 --> 01:16:29.836]  I mean, what was it like to know the truth?
[01:16:30.276 --> 01:16:31.437]  And I got to the truth, folks.
[01:16:31.457 --> 01:16:32.417]  We know what happened here.
[01:16:32.717 --> 01:16:36.779]  And then to see these sickening ghouls being turned into movie stars.
[01:16:37.432 --> 01:16:41.014]  Well, the frustration, I can't describe the frustration.
[01:16:41.454 --> 01:16:54.942]  The other part of it is that what was not reported by the mainstream media is the fact that more than likely all the evidence points that her husband caused her collapse.
[01:16:56.130 --> 01:16:58.231]  And we have gone to a different store.
[01:16:58.251 --> 01:16:59.892]  He's trying to get an investigation.
[01:17:00.512 --> 01:17:02.993]  And we get stonewalled wherever we go.
[01:17:03.153 --> 01:17:05.454]  And that's right on up through the state attorney of Florida.
[01:17:05.514 --> 01:17:12.157]  By the way, then Michael, when your daughter died, ran off with the body and tried to inter her without you guys even being there.
[01:17:12.197 --> 01:17:12.977]  And then he had some...
[01:17:13.437 --> 01:17:15.719]  Well, the connections, and you'd have to see how everything's intertwined.
[01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:49.105]  The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy was appointed by a committee that was headed up by the local district attorney.
[01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:53.287]  And he was the one that blocked an investigation on what happened to Terry.
[01:17:54.448 --> 01:18:03.812]  So he picks this medical examiner who comes out with a report that makes the whole court system, you know, it's whitewashed and it's lily white.
[01:18:04.772 --> 01:18:07.474]  And they would not allow us to bring in our own...
[01:18:09.173 --> 01:18:11.996]  A medical examiner, a pathologist.
[01:18:12.016 --> 01:18:17.042]  We could not have any pathologists to even witness the autopsy.
[01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:19.885]  So we had to take his word on it.
[01:18:20.466 --> 01:18:23.569]  And there's so many discrepancies in his report that it's ludicrous.
[01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:27.954]  So the whole thing you talk about, it was arranged.
[01:18:30.069 --> 01:18:30.570]  Stay there.
[01:18:30.850 --> 01:18:32.571]  We've recapped history for people now.
[01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:40.254]  I want to jump forward to the new developments in this case, which are unbelievable, with Robert Schindler, father of Terry Schindler.
[01:18:40.294 --> 01:18:41.655]  You know, it was Terry Schiavo.
[01:18:42.755 --> 01:18:44.576]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:18:44.596 --> 01:18:48.838]  The websites are Infowars.com, JonesReport.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:49.178 --> 01:18:51.219]  By the way, JonesReport.com is excellent.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.320]  Be sure and check it out.
[01:18:56.266 --> 01:18:57.906]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.507 --> 01:19:00.327]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.448 --> 01:19:09.331]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.552 --> 01:19:12.193]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:12.173 --> 01:19:13.593]  's patented methodology.

[01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:54.903]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.983 --> 01:19:59.765]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:07.730]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:13.353]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:13.573 --> 01:20:20.557]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:20.937 --> 01:20:21.557]  We're good to go.
[01:20:21.597 --> 01:20:21.797]  I think?
[01:20:39.444 --> 01:20:40.004]  We're good to go.
[01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:40.324]  I think?
[01:20:55.126 --> 01:20:56.147]  The war on terrorism.
[01:20:56.487 --> 01:20:59.269]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:59.529 --> 01:21:03.692]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:04.113 --> 01:21:04.953]  So what do you do?
[01:21:05.254 --> 01:21:09.837]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:10.325 --> 01:21:10.905]  We're good to go.
[01:21:39.924 --> 01:21:44.225]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.

[01:21:56.769 --> 01:22:05.952]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:22:06.934 --> 01:22:07.794]  We're good to go.
[01:22:07.814 --> 01:22:07.994]  I think?
[01:22:37.288 --> 01:22:40.150]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:43.731 --> 01:22:44.372]  Call now.

[01:22:55.237 --> 01:23:00.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.362]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:18.272 --> 01:23:19.573]  Bob Schindler is our guest.
[01:23:19.593 --> 01:23:27.517]  And I said something very important earlier that I don't want you to glaze over, folks.
[01:23:27.897 --> 01:23:29.278]  I don't just pick sides.
[01:23:30.078 --> 01:23:31.059]  I research things.
[01:23:31.599 --> 01:23:32.859]  I look into them.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:41.964]  And it had to be two, three years before it got to be really big news with the Terry Schindler Shivo case.
[01:23:42.404 --> 01:23:46.526]  We were on Terry and the Schindler's side because we knew what had happened.
[01:23:47.009 --> 01:23:47.870]  We knew the truth.
[01:23:48.591 --> 01:23:50.553]  The documented, verifiable truth.
[01:23:50.673 --> 01:23:57.459]  And to try to detail how ghoulish and how powerful the pro-death movement is in America.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:08.230]  I mean, I have interviewed liberals that write for major publications who are on our side who can list hundreds of cases of where people are in wheelchairs talking.
[01:24:09.193 --> 01:24:09.874]  We're good to go.
[01:24:33.184 --> 01:24:39.109]  Well, we're presently involved with the Andrea Clark case down there in Houston.
[01:24:40.269 --> 01:24:58.003]  What we've done with the foundation is, and it's more of Terry's legacy, we're committed to help people and to make sure this never happens again if we can do it, and also to expose the euthanasia that's going on throughout this country and the world.
[01:24:58.883 --> 01:25:02.166]  And I make a plea with all your listeners today
[01:25:03.592 --> 01:25:11.395]  There is a movement, and it's been shrouded before, but it's being exposed every day.
[01:25:11.455 --> 01:25:19.358]  And I think another example, aside from Terry, is what's happening with Andrea Clark down there in Houston.
[01:25:20.178 --> 01:25:24.400]  And that thing, her life is in jeopardy, I mean, right now.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.460]  Tell folks about that.
[01:25:26.423 --> 01:25:27.684]  Well, she's been in St.
[01:25:27.744 --> 01:25:37.533]  Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, and their bioethics committee determined they were not going to treat her any longer, and she's on a dialysis machine.
[01:25:37.553 --> 01:25:45.380]  And because they made that determination not to treat her
[01:25:46.364 --> 01:25:52.249]  They advised the family to get her out of that hospital or else she's going to die there because of lack of treatment.
[01:25:52.750 --> 01:26:00.596]  Well, apparently no other hospitals will take her once a hospital makes that declaration about a patient.
[01:26:01.557 --> 01:26:07.582]  And there was an opportunity, we thought, over the weekend to move her up to Illinois.
[01:26:08.643 --> 01:26:09.744]  And just think about that.
[01:26:09.784 --> 01:26:14.408]  You have to take a person from Texas and move them to Illinois to get them treated in a hospital.
[01:26:15.525 --> 01:26:16.706]  But that fell through.
[01:26:17.507 --> 01:26:31.858]  And I know the attorney, I spoke with the attorney this morning, is negotiating with the hospitals and their bioethics committee about preserving her life until they can possibly find a location for her.
[01:26:32.119 --> 01:26:33.560]  Now, tell folks about her condition.
[01:26:35.141 --> 01:26:35.662]  Andrea?
[01:26:35.782 --> 01:26:36.042]  Yes.
[01:26:36.542 --> 01:26:38.724]  She's on a dialysis machine.
[01:26:39.765 --> 01:26:40.565]  We know that she's...
[01:26:41.616 --> 01:26:42.236]  I mean, she's ill.
[01:26:42.256 --> 01:26:43.416]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:26:43.856 --> 01:26:47.737]  But she's not determined, unless they remove the life support.
[01:26:47.757 --> 01:26:51.618]  But she's cognizant, and she's told her family that she wants to live.
[01:26:51.638 --> 01:26:52.718]  She doesn't want to die.
[01:26:53.438 --> 01:26:56.519]  But the hospital has made a determination not to treat her again.
[01:26:56.539 --> 01:26:57.299]  Now, let's understand.
[01:26:57.319 --> 01:26:59.919]  And we see these cases every week, folks.
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.320]  This is a person.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:07.801]  They've been doing this quietly, but thanks to the Schindlers and others, it's not going on in the dark anymore, at least to some level.
[01:27:08.439 --> 01:27:16.506]  Now, it's still very shady, but this is someone openly saying, help me, I don't want to die, speaking the words, and they're having their treatment taken away.
[01:27:16.946 --> 01:27:18.127]  Yes, and it's happening.
[01:27:18.147 --> 01:27:19.769]  You know, it's not just St.
[01:27:19.809 --> 01:27:21.530]  Luke's Episcopal in Houston.
[01:27:22.231 --> 01:27:30.298]  It's happening in other hospitals, but they're doing it without the systematic way that St.
[01:27:30.338 --> 01:27:30.938]  Luke's is.
[01:27:31.018 --> 01:27:31.539]  At least St.
[01:27:31.599 --> 01:27:33.080]  Luke's put them on notice for a while.
[01:27:34.151 --> 01:27:35.192]  You know, 10 days.
[01:27:35.412 --> 01:27:38.893]  Meanwhile, Michael ghoulishly is circling.
[01:27:42.235 --> 01:27:50.598]  In regards to... Well, I had just read here in the papers that he's been out championing biorethesis boards having these powers.
[01:27:51.038 --> 01:27:51.619]  Exactly.
[01:27:51.839 --> 01:27:59.422]  No, he's up in Philadelphia speaking at the University of Pennsylvania at a symposium with Judge Greer.
[01:28:00.383 --> 01:28:02.065]  The one who sentenced Terry to die.
[01:28:02.245 --> 01:28:03.346]  Showing their pro-death.
[01:28:03.366 --> 01:28:08.409]  They're at the big bioethicist, Peter Singer, pro-death, sicko meeting.
[01:28:09.991 --> 01:28:11.132]  These people are activists.
[01:28:11.872 --> 01:28:12.953]  Bob, we're going to break.
[01:28:12.973 --> 01:28:16.536]  I want to come back and talk to you a few more minutes and talk about your foundation and how we can help you.
[01:28:17.176 --> 01:28:19.398]  I want to understand, though, the mindset.
[01:28:19.418 --> 01:28:22.240]  You've been around more of these people than I have.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.661]  You've been fighting them for a decade.
[01:28:23.701 --> 01:28:27.744]  Plus, I want to understand just why they love death so much.
[01:28:28.045 --> 01:28:29.806]  This is how they chose to be activists.
[01:28:31.158 --> 01:28:32.299]  This is what they're into.
[01:28:32.359 --> 01:28:33.060]  They just love it.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:40.004]  And of course, big money in this country and the insurance companies love it too because they don't want to pay for people that are sick.
[01:28:40.445 --> 01:28:40.965]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.127 --> 01:28:45.008]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.508 --> 01:28:47.089]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:50.712]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.019 --> 01:29:00.004]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:02.566]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[01:29:02.806 --> 01:29:11.072]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta synthetic oil treatments, Protecta engine treatment, Protecta transmission treatment, and Protecta complete fuel system treatment.
[01:29:11.252 --> 01:29:11.873]  We're good to go.

[01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:28.288]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.308 --> 01:29:28.849]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.949 --> 01:29:29.549]  We're good to go.

[01:30:58.869 --> 01:31:05.591]  Wouldn't it be nice if you had all of your important items in one place and ready to grab just in case you had to leave quickly in an emergency?

[01:32:13.468 --> 01:32:15.770]  We're going to be taking some of your calls, come up in about ten minutes.
[01:32:16.710 --> 01:32:17.830]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-
[01:32:20.572 --> 01:32:40.924]  2599231.
[01:32:23.294 --> 01:32:40.924]  Bob, I don't think the average American realizes, they're always shocked when it's reported in the Wall Street Journal or in the Associated Press, that they're actually killing people who are in wheelchairs or in beds, who are openly begging for food and water, in some cases who don't even have life-threatening illnesses.
[01:32:41.464 --> 01:32:46.387]  Can you explain to people, because obviously you're an expert on this, living it and fighting it for many years,
[01:32:47.302 --> 01:32:53.125]  The mindset of these individuals and why they do what they do and how we can help fight it.
[01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:55.886]  Well, I think you have different scenarios.
[01:32:55.926 --> 01:33:07.612]  You have these bioethics people are viewing people who are handicapped as a hindrance to society.
[01:33:08.613 --> 01:33:16.737]  And if your listeners would go in and do a Google search on the T4 program in Nazi Germany,
[01:33:17.682 --> 01:33:22.044]  And that was in the early 30s, and that was a precursor to the Holocaust.
[01:33:22.904 --> 01:33:31.588]  And what they were doing there was they were literally exterminating people based on their quality of life, and they used propaganda to do that.
[01:33:31.608 --> 01:33:37.571]  And that was the Nazis' way of cleansing that race, and you know all about that stuff.
[01:33:38.291 --> 01:33:47.295]  But you have a replication that is happening in this country today that's identical to the blueprint that was laid out in the early 30s by the Nazis.
[01:33:48.426 --> 01:33:49.586]  And that's the one scenario.
[01:33:49.626 --> 01:34:07.951]  Then you have the other case where people want to get rid of their loved ones for whatever their reasons, very possibly to inherit money, where they have parents that have an estate, and rather than essentially waste that money on their medical treatment, they'd rather end their lives.
[01:34:09.112 --> 01:34:14.113]  And you have wives that are trying to eliminate husbands because their marriages are not...
[01:34:15.433 --> 01:34:19.216]  Rather than divorce them, if the husband becomes ill, they would rather have him die.
[01:34:19.236 --> 01:34:43.111]  So it's a conglomeration of things, but the thing that's frightening is you have attorneys like this guy, Felix, who had Terry's case, who is spearheading this movement, and the courts are going along with it, where they will take these people and they will literally condemn them to death by having their life support removed.
[01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:47.462]  Now, Bob... Just one more thing let me add.
[01:34:47.482 --> 01:34:47.702]  Sure.
[01:34:48.122 --> 01:34:50.483]  You ask, you know, I've gotten to know these people.
[01:34:50.943 --> 01:35:02.226]  This guy, Felas, who is the euthanasia attorney, he makes statements that he can actually communicate with dead people who are thanking him for their murder.
[01:35:03.946 --> 01:35:07.307]  Now, that's unbelievable that somebody would make a statement like that.
[01:35:07.387 --> 01:35:08.147]  Well, it's creepy.
[01:35:08.607 --> 01:35:10.948]  Well, the guy, if you're ever in his company...
[01:35:12.136 --> 01:35:13.618]  I think he's possessed by the devil.
[01:35:14.038 --> 01:35:14.959]  I have no doubt about it.
[01:35:15.499 --> 01:35:17.401]  And other people have said the same thing.
[01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:19.542]  There's something about him.
[01:35:19.602 --> 01:35:22.485]  You get the chill that's through your body when you're in this man's company.
[01:35:22.505 --> 01:35:28.890]  And that's the type of people that are out there that are pushing this movement.
[01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:39.078]  And with Terry's case, they set a precedent by killing her, and we call it judicial homicide.
[01:35:40.135 --> 01:35:53.440]  And their effort will be to legalize euthanasia in Florida, where you have an elderly population that is costing the taxpayers money, that is costing the insurance companies money.
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.001]  So, if you'll follow the money trail.
[01:35:56.522 --> 01:36:03.644]  Well, Jack Kevorkian was fired from two hospitals for doing things with dead bodies in the morgue.
[01:36:03.744 --> 01:36:05.045]  That's mainstream news.
[01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:09.767]  And the people that have met him or talked to him say he's very ghoulish.
[01:36:09.807 --> 01:36:10.668]  You get chills.
[01:36:11.949 --> 01:36:13.590]  He admittedly is into death.
[01:36:14.071 --> 01:36:14.991]  He loves death.
[01:36:15.072 --> 01:36:16.413]  These are sick individuals.
[01:36:16.473 --> 01:36:17.914]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:19.215 --> 01:36:26.961]  Now, at the same time, this movement all over the world is pushing for the state to have the power to kill you.
[01:36:27.482 --> 01:36:28.763]  You mentioned Dr. Peter Singer.
[01:36:28.823 --> 01:36:31.185]  He calls babies mackerel babies.
[01:36:32.206 --> 01:36:35.388]  Old people, worthless, retarded children, subhuman.
[01:36:35.768 --> 01:36:37.149]  He's allowed to use those terms.
[01:36:37.209 --> 01:36:58.322]  Now, the first head of UNESCO, Julian Huxley, who of course his brother was Aldous Huxley of Brave New World, and Aldous Huxley wrote other books and then of course gave speeches saying, no, no, no, I wrote this book because I'm around the eugenics crowd and this is what they're planning by the year 2000.
[01:36:59.022 --> 01:37:01.324]  And obviously they're a few years behind, but not many.
[01:37:02.165 --> 01:37:06.308]  And the Nazis used, actually, British and American eugenics manuals.
[01:37:06.608 --> 01:37:08.109]  That was a defense at Nuremberg.
[01:37:08.129 --> 01:37:10.030]  And, of course, it didn't hold water.
[01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:18.696]  But Margaret Sanger and many others who were into eugenics that wanted to get rid of the, quote, social weeds, had actually been the forerunners of this.
[01:37:18.756 --> 01:37:24.720]  And so, in the 1950s, after eugenics had been discredited and the term had been demonized properly, so...
[01:37:26.098 --> 01:37:42.390]  They changed the name to bioethicists, bioethics, and then there's a range of views and a debate within that group, but the dominant circles, the leaders of it, funded by the big tax-free foundations, want us to have absolutely no human rights or God-given rights, Bob.
[01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:45.132]  So when you bring up the Nazis, you're absolutely hitting the nail on the head.
[01:37:45.612 --> 01:37:49.755]  Well, I'm kind of a history buff, and
[01:37:50.573 --> 01:37:52.854]  I said that immediately when this was happening with Terry.
[01:37:52.894 --> 01:37:55.955]  I said, my God, this is right out of the textbook.
[01:37:57.415 --> 01:37:58.296]  The word textbook.
[01:37:58.376 --> 01:38:02.017]  There was a case in California, Robert Wendland.
[01:38:02.037 --> 01:38:03.037]  I don't know if you remember that.
[01:38:03.057 --> 01:38:04.798]  Yeah, he was the guy in a wheelchair.
[01:38:04.858 --> 01:38:06.959]  He could even bowl.
[01:38:07.399 --> 01:38:10.800]  I interviewed the Wall Street Journal writer who physically went and visited him.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:14.541]  He would giggle, he would laugh, he would sing, and they murdered him.
[01:38:14.761 --> 01:38:16.662]  Yes, they absolutely murdered him.
[01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:30.227]  When Terry's case was public, I was communicating with people involved in the Wendland case who were kind of advising me of what to look for.
[01:38:32.028 --> 01:38:41.575]  I used the textbook 101 for euthanasia, what they do to these patients like Robert Wendland and the abuse they put him through, Robert Wendland and Terry.
[01:38:42.199 --> 01:38:50.081]  Where Wendland eventually had pneumonia and died before he could be treated properly and receive his rehabilitation.
[01:38:50.821 --> 01:38:56.923]  He won in the courts in California, but he wasn't alive to celebrate the victory because they killed him first.
[01:38:57.383 --> 01:38:59.184]  And they tried to do the same thing to Terry.
[01:39:00.684 --> 01:39:11.127]  They followed the script from the Wendland case where they tried to induce pneumonia by... They were like force-feeding her liquids where she would...
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.740]  No.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.121]  No, the only thing here is the... No, there's no radio.
[01:39:39.611 --> 01:39:42.452]  Yeah, I'm getting some type of strange, real low radio feed.
[01:39:42.472 --> 01:39:46.874]  The network needs to check that, but there's no other shows running right now, so I wonder what it is.
[01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:47.574]  Sorry, Bob.
[01:39:47.674 --> 01:39:50.455]  It's probably our euthanasia friends tapping our line.
[01:39:51.315 --> 01:39:51.835]  Who knows?
[01:39:52.916 --> 01:39:55.917]  And I say that facetiously, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.
[01:39:56.877 --> 01:40:05.400]  They don't like what we're doing, I can tell you that, because we're putting a stick in their spokes, and they're not happy at all because we've exposed them in a couple of cases.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.781]  Not only Andrea's, but...
[01:40:07.782 --> 01:40:09.764]  We had one up in Jacksonville the same way.
[01:40:09.804 --> 01:40:10.665]  Well, that's the good news.
[01:40:10.725 --> 01:40:19.353]  They cannot deal with exposure to the light of day because the vast majority of Americans are against their radical views.
[01:40:19.833 --> 01:40:23.336]  Yeah, tell us about the foundation and tell us about the new book, and then we're going to go to calls.
[01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:29.782]  Yeah, the foundation is Terry's, the Terry Schindler Schiavo Foundation.
[01:40:29.802 --> 01:40:33.426]  And you can pick that up on the website with on Terry's fight...
[01:40:34.585 --> 01:40:35.806]  Terrysfight.org.
[01:40:35.886 --> 01:40:37.748]  Terrysfight.org.
[01:40:37.788 --> 01:40:39.749]  We have a link to that on Infowars.com.
[01:40:39.789 --> 01:40:41.631]  That's been around for the past five years.
[01:40:42.171 --> 01:40:44.513]  And the book is called A Life That Matters.
[01:40:45.194 --> 01:40:46.995]  And it's a legacy of Terry Schiavo.
[01:40:47.656 --> 01:40:59.886]  And I think that people read that and it's going to open their eyes up not only to what's happening in our society, but also what happened to Terry that was totally...
[01:41:01.044 --> 01:41:03.945]  Bob, will you send me a copy?
[01:41:04.265 --> 01:41:06.506]  I may want to carry it in my online bookstore.
[01:41:06.746 --> 01:41:07.126]  Certainly.
[01:41:08.007 --> 01:41:08.887]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:08.907 --> 01:41:11.728]  I need your address.
[01:41:12.489 --> 01:41:13.129]  Fantastic.
[01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:14.029]  I'll do that.
[01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:16.610]  Tell us about the foundation itself.
[01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:23.393]  What we've done with the foundation is that originally it was established to fight for Terry's life.
[01:41:24.625 --> 01:41:36.049]  And when we lost that battle, our family sat down and said, we have to do something to prevent this from ever happening to anyone else again, because Terri had suffered a horrific death.
[01:41:37.069 --> 01:41:41.151]  Dehydrating someone to death is the worst possible thing you can do.
[01:41:42.171 --> 01:41:52.935]  And since then, we've been working and trying to establish a network throughout the country of physicians and neurologists and
[01:41:55.116 --> 01:42:09.078]  For healthcare professionals, that when we do get a case like Andrea Clark out there in Houston, that there's someone we can go to and try and get the person helped, the patient helped.
[01:42:09.927 --> 01:42:11.528]  And to expose what's happening.
[01:42:11.628 --> 01:42:13.389]  Now, we've got to resist these predators.
[01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:28.279]  And for those that don't know, literally every week, and I'm not even looking for these stories, I see reports of people who aren't even sick but are old and whose insurance has run out, and they literally strap them down and kill them.
[01:42:28.959 --> 01:42:33.002]  And it goes from that extreme to things where you have folks like Terry.
[01:42:34.603 --> 01:42:37.525]  And, I mean, Bob, what is it like for you to see this over and over again?
[01:42:39.173 --> 01:42:45.878]  Well, you know, it's an open wound, and the old adjuvant pouring salt into the wound.
[01:42:47.185 --> 01:42:53.308]  But if that's what it takes to get the people to wake up, then it's something that we'll have to endure.
[01:42:53.509 --> 01:43:05.395]  Well, the good news is we did get Jack Kevorkian into jail because even national news reports and the police admit that over 70% of the people he killed didn't even have serious illnesses.
[01:43:05.435 --> 01:43:12.339]  They were mentally ill and were pro-death, fixated mental patients, basically.
[01:43:12.859 --> 01:43:15.841]  And this ghoul would drive around in his Volkswagen bus and say,
[01:43:16.670 --> 01:43:16.910]  Well, sure.
[01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:17.991]  That's what happens with the press.
[01:43:18.011 --> 01:43:22.474]  They'll take a guy like Ted Bundy and they'll persecute him, but yet you have a Judge Greer or a George Felis that
[01:43:42.515 --> 01:43:46.576]  And I had told Felix on public radio that he's no different than Ted Bundy.
[01:43:46.596 --> 01:43:47.676]  He's a serial killer.
[01:43:47.696 --> 01:43:50.037]  And he's murdering innocent people.
[01:43:50.997 --> 01:43:53.218]  Which he was very offended by me saying that.
[01:43:53.258 --> 01:43:54.738]  He's helping them, not murdering them.
[01:43:55.219 --> 01:43:56.119]  They all get off on it.
[01:43:56.159 --> 01:43:56.959]  Everybody's a sicko.
[01:43:56.979 --> 01:43:59.360]  They're helping, and they're doing them a favor.
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:00.980]  Let's take a call.
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:02.521]  John in Ohio.
[01:44:02.581 --> 01:44:03.641]  John, you're on the air.
[01:44:03.681 --> 01:44:04.001]  Welcome.
[01:44:05.213 --> 01:44:25.242]  I was calling before you, Mr. Schindler, a guest about something else, and it's going to be hard for me not to be misunderstood in a short call, but I do agree with everything he said, even though, and maybe actually because I'm on the left, and because I think this is absolutely... Well, sir, this isn't a left-wing or right-wing issue.
[01:44:25.302 --> 01:44:33.165]  Right, but I understand that, but this is an issue of cost-cutting by, as you said, the insurance company's
[01:44:33.789 --> 01:44:43.694]  The Wall Street banks, the IMF, that are simply looting countries on behalf of monopoly capitalist corporations around the world and destroying the life support systems of their infrastructure.
[01:44:43.894 --> 01:44:44.735]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:44:44.975 --> 01:44:46.195]  I don't see where the debate is.
[01:44:46.335 --> 01:44:47.416]  Well, yeah.
[01:44:47.516 --> 01:45:02.784]  My other point was to really say, as much as I admire the things you're doing, exposing the military-industrial complex and the neocons' complicity in 9-11, the war against Iraq, the police state, and these Malthusian ideas...
[01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:18.697]  I think on two issues, you are being crack-switched right into their camp, into the camp of the military-industrial complex on the issue of this kind of birchite, anti-communist propaganda and the immigration issue, at least in the emphasis that you take.
[01:45:18.837 --> 01:45:19.938]  John, period.
[01:45:20.078 --> 01:45:23.339]  A Bush PR firm with Fox is staging all of this.
[01:45:23.399 --> 01:45:31.583]  It's about the Pan-American Union, no borders, and if you can't figure that out, you are being willfully ignorant, John, because you're not stupid.
[01:45:31.963 --> 01:45:50.252]  Well, I saw that thing on Common Dreams as well, and you sort of distorted it a little bit, because they were saying, don't blame, in effect, don't blame a scapegoat, these poor people coming in by the millions, blame NAFTA, blame some of these... John, I'm not, I don't even dislike all these illegal aliens, I'm saying they're tools.
[01:45:50.732 --> 01:46:01.578]  Well, the point I'm making here is that some of the same people that are calling for these stringent criminalizations, like Sensenbrenner and the others, are the same ones who push NAFTA, which are forcing these people off their land,
[01:46:01.994 --> 01:46:12.440]  Some of these same corporations that are bringing these people in are bashing Mexican immigrant workers to scapegoat them.
[01:46:12.661 --> 01:46:14.602]  But that's just propaganda.
[01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:16.363]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:46:16.563 --> 01:46:17.864]  Who's up next for Mr. Schindler?
[01:46:20.786 --> 01:46:21.706]  Mike in Louisiana.
[01:46:21.726 --> 01:46:22.367]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:46:22.767 --> 01:46:23.547]  Hello, Alex.
[01:46:23.848 --> 01:46:24.168]  Hi.
[01:46:24.488 --> 01:46:26.249]  Hello, Mr. Schindler.
[01:46:26.989 --> 01:46:30.732]  Well, I'm not on the left, and I'm not in the center.
[01:46:31.656 --> 01:46:36.900]  But I agree with what you're saying, times two probably.
[01:46:38.121 --> 01:46:49.068]  The primary reason for my call was an idea I had about the previous issue we were talking about, about the shut American down deal.
[01:46:50.549 --> 01:46:59.255]  What if everybody that took off work today to go to some kind of rally, or for whatever reason,
[01:47:00.768 --> 01:47:08.950]  What if an American out of work or two showed up and said, Hey, I need a job.
[01:47:10.150 --> 01:47:13.671]  You got any vacancies today?
[01:47:14.192 --> 01:47:24.654]  Just a thought, because I know a lot of people are going to hear that, and it's a little late in the day for everybody to get up and get out there and go find a job, but there may be some available today.
[01:47:24.894 --> 01:47:25.835]  I'll get off the air.
[01:47:26.135 --> 01:47:27.195]  Kudos to you guys.
[01:47:27.921 --> 01:47:29.282]  Death to the New World Order.
[01:47:29.742 --> 01:47:30.702]  We shall prevail.
[01:47:31.702 --> 01:47:32.583]  We shall prevail.
[01:47:32.983 --> 01:47:40.306]  Sir, the Spanish media, the English-speaking media, they all got together with a Bush PR firm with Fox publicly and staged all this.
[01:47:40.806 --> 01:47:43.847]  That's why you see millions of people out in the streets demonstrating.
[01:47:44.507 --> 01:47:54.751]  You don't see the media telling Americans, who are now 91-plus percent against the open borders, it's now grown from 87 percent in the last month, this stuff's kind of backfired,
[01:47:55.541 --> 01:47:58.982]  You don't see the media telling the American people to get out and demonstrate.
[01:47:59.382 --> 01:48:00.343]  That's why you've seen this.
[01:48:00.403 --> 01:48:04.064]  Bob, I know it's a separate issue, but the border's being wide open.
[01:48:04.284 --> 01:48:13.407]  Our government's more than happy to pay for all these illegal aliens and pay for their pregnancies and births and pay for their welfare, but then we can't pay for people who are sick in the hospital.
[01:48:13.867 --> 01:48:15.327]  It's all related, Alex.
[01:48:16.168 --> 01:48:18.608]  That's it.
[01:48:20.549 --> 01:48:23.870]  The cost for one of our own people
[01:48:25.311 --> 01:48:43.994]  They're not willing to address that cost and that dollar and cents are equating the cost and the value of a person's life and of their, I'm getting a mental blank here, of their condition.
[01:48:44.574 --> 01:48:48.975]  You know, is there really a help for society?
[01:48:48.995 --> 01:48:51.176]  Is there a detriment for society?
[01:48:51.196 --> 01:48:52.876]  And that's how they're looking at that.
[01:48:52.976 --> 01:48:53.676]  You know,
[01:48:54.537 --> 01:48:56.138]  You know, it's a dollar and cent equation.
[01:48:59.221 --> 01:48:59.581]  Hello?
[01:49:01.003 --> 01:49:01.283]  Hello?
[01:49:01.303 --> 01:49:02.444]  No, I'm listening to you.
[01:49:02.724 --> 01:49:04.626]  I mean, I was just thinking about what you were saying.
[01:49:05.046 --> 01:49:05.747]  No, it's what it is.
[01:49:05.767 --> 01:49:06.447]  I mean, come on.
[01:49:06.527 --> 01:49:08.949]  You know, everything is you follow the money trail.
[01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:13.213]  And quality of life is one of the key things that enters into it.
[01:49:13.273 --> 01:49:16.376]  And people, their insurance companies and...
[01:49:17.817 --> 01:49:19.939]  They're sitting back and they don't want to spend that money.
[01:49:19.959 --> 01:49:23.562]  You know, your people that are being attacked.
[01:49:23.722 --> 01:49:25.884]  You know, the government revenue.
[01:49:26.565 --> 01:49:30.048]  Well, we were always able to take care of our old and infirm before.
[01:49:30.909 --> 01:49:32.270]  And now, why can't we do it?
[01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:34.432]  I mean, it's just so shameful.
[01:49:34.472 --> 01:49:35.093]  And a lot of us...
[01:49:36.135 --> 01:49:40.937]  A lot of us are going to end up in the position that Terry was in near the end of our lives.
[01:49:41.137 --> 01:49:43.458]  We could go out and be in car wrecks today.
[01:49:43.498 --> 01:49:45.840]  It could happen right on you, anybody, at any time.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:46.980]  It could happen in your kitchen.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:47.921]  You could get electrocuted.
[01:49:47.961 --> 01:49:48.321]  Whatever.
[01:49:48.641 --> 01:49:49.281]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:49.341 --> 01:49:51.042]  Final segment for Bob Schindler.
[01:49:51.302 --> 01:49:52.143]  Take a few more calls.
[01:49:53.903 --> 01:49:58.265]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.445 --> 01:50:02.868]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.008 --> 01:50:03.808]  There is a change.
[01:50:05.469 --> 01:50:07.391]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:50:07.471 --> 01:50:10.253]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:50:10.553 --> 01:50:14.776]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.837 --> 01:50:21.762]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.902 --> 01:50:23.904]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:34.687]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.887 --> 01:50:40.268]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.769 --> 01:50:43.429]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:43.509 --> 01:50:44.670]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:45.150 --> 01:50:46.950]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:53.456 --> 01:51:01.722]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.982 --> 01:51:06.325]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.625 --> 01:51:15.551]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.751 --> 01:51:19.374]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.654 --> 01:51:24.676]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons for one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.976 --> 01:51:31.719]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:32.740]  What about you?

[01:53:03.033 --> 01:53:05.614]  We've got masses of calls coming in.
[01:53:05.634 --> 01:53:08.375]  People want to talk about the open borders, the May Day Parade.
[01:53:09.483 --> 01:53:10.103]  We'll get to it.
[01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:10.723]  We'll cover it.
[01:53:11.564 --> 01:53:12.984]  We have a guest coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:13.924 --> 01:53:25.647]  But I want you to realize how important it is that our government, our media, our culture, the establishment line is we want to start killing the old, the infirm.
[01:53:26.928 --> 01:53:30.248]  People who aren't even as in near about a shape as Terry was.
[01:53:30.268 --> 01:53:34.710]  I mean, people that are talking, openly saying, man, please have some water, honey.
[01:53:35.370 --> 01:53:36.490]  I'm very, very hungry.
[01:53:37.964 --> 01:53:43.585]  And it's so horrible to see this going on, and it's getting worse and worse.
[01:53:43.625 --> 01:53:55.908]  Now, it's the minority that holds this view and is pro-death, but that minority is in control of the hospital bioethics boards, they're in control of the universities, they're in control of the media, and they love it.
[01:53:55.968 --> 01:53:57.909]  It's a trendy thing.
[01:53:58.949 --> 01:54:01.090]  Going back to Bob Schindler.
[01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:02.530]  Bob...
[01:54:03.379 --> 01:54:04.839]  We've only got a few minutes left here with you.
[01:54:04.859 --> 01:54:06.260]  I really want to thank you for joining us.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.681]  Would you say things are getting more positive or more negative?
[01:54:09.701 --> 01:54:16.463]  Would you say that people are more awakened to this issue now and that more good things are happening than bad things are happening?
[01:54:17.023 --> 01:54:19.024]  What's your view about where things stand right now?
[01:54:19.424 --> 01:54:23.025]  We're nowhere near heading bottom on this thing.
[01:54:23.305 --> 01:54:24.305]  It's an ongoing thing.
[01:54:24.585 --> 01:54:27.646]  The amount of calls we're getting is increasing.
[01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:32.001]  So it's getting worse.
[01:54:32.201 --> 01:54:33.001]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:33.021 --> 01:54:41.208]  And I would suggest that your listeners go to your local hospice and ask them to give the information.
[01:54:41.228 --> 01:54:47.052]  This will give you an idea of what the longevity of a patient is at that hospice facility.
[01:54:47.773 --> 01:54:56.160]  Because some of them, you go back two, three, four years ago, the average stay maybe was three months or two months.
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:55:00.263]  And now in some places it's down to maybe two weeks to three weeks.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.722]  So what they're doing is they're bringing these people in.
[01:55:03.742 --> 01:55:12.151]  They're using, and not all of the hospices, and let me clarify that, but some of them are using hospices as a way to facilitate a quick death.
[01:55:13.513 --> 01:55:22.502]  And it would be a good thing for people to do that, to go to the hospice and say, okay, let me see what your longevity rate is of your patients and how long they've been in here before they die.
[01:55:23.183 --> 01:55:27.306]  Well, just in closing, Bob, my grandmother died about two years ago.
[01:55:27.326 --> 01:55:33.752]  I still have one great-grandmother, and she's a great-grandmother to my children, but I mean, she's a great person.
[01:55:34.192 --> 01:55:48.964]  But my other grandmother, my father's mother, had a stroke, and then she couldn't swallow, but she rehabilitated herself and lived, I guess, about ten years happily, and then finally died, but had ten good years.
[01:55:49.838 --> 01:55:56.203]  Now, over and over again, when they are killing somebody, most often it's where they can't swallow from a stroke.
[01:55:56.583 --> 01:56:02.488]  They can still walk around and walk the dog and go to the movies, whatever, go to church, and that they kill them.
[01:56:02.928 --> 01:56:11.094]  How often have you seen that where somebody doesn't have family that supports them, they have the stroke, they can't swallow, the bioethics board says, you die?
[01:56:11.114 --> 01:56:15.117]  Well, I've seen people...
[01:56:16.670 --> 01:56:34.204]  That have been declared, you know, their life is, they would no longer receive any type of medical assistance, then this was done where an appointed guardian would go in the court and ask for the termination of the person's life.
[01:56:35.265 --> 01:56:43.612]  And that's with the elderly people that have no family, and they get the estate appointed guardians, and once they fleece the money they do have in their estates,
[01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:49.503]  Bob Schindler will talk to you in the near future.
[01:56:49.543 --> 01:56:51.924]  God bless you for your fine work.
[01:56:51.944 --> 01:56:53.345]  I hope people do buy that book.
[01:56:53.365 --> 01:56:56.047]  I think it will wake a lot of people up and open their eyes.
[01:56:56.327 --> 01:56:57.087]  Absolutely, Bob.
[01:56:57.147 --> 01:56:58.208]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:56:58.248 --> 01:56:59.289]  Thank you very, very much.
[01:57:00.555 --> 01:57:00.875]  You bet.
[01:57:00.915 --> 01:57:01.775]  Take care, my friend.
[01:57:02.536 --> 01:57:08.977]  Folks, this is such a horrible issue, such a bone-chilling issue, but it's really going on, and it's one more thing we have to expose.
[01:57:09.017 --> 01:57:10.838]  It's all part of the culture of death.
[01:57:11.338 --> 01:57:23.121]  Don't forget prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day to get over 1,000 pieces of media, all my films, my book, my weekly TV reports, in-studio interviews, prisonplanet.tv, always improving it.
[01:57:23.701 --> 01:57:24.101]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.756 --> 01:57:55.641]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:57.323]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.984 --> 01:58:01.669]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.169 --> 01:58:06.254]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.627 --> 01:58:10.389]  Well, we've dropped the big bombshell.
[01:58:10.429 --> 01:58:12.530]  More documentation, more evidence of it.
[01:58:12.891 --> 01:58:17.535]  But even the pro-US, anti-illegal alien crowd isn't even aware of it.
[01:58:17.975 --> 01:58:26.122]  George Bush and Vicente Fox hired a PR firm and are staging now into, what, week four plus of the demonstrations.
[01:58:26.643 --> 01:58:31.287]  It is Commie Day, it is May Day, and they're out there stomping around working for Lord Bush.
[01:58:32.515 --> 01:58:34.836]  That's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:58:35.236 --> 01:58:43.218]  Coming up at 15 after, we have Susan Wioski, coordinator for a major press conference that they just had up in D.C.
[01:58:43.258 --> 01:58:44.238]  It was on C-SPAN.
[01:58:44.918 --> 01:58:49.500]  Hispanic Coalition tells illegal alien protesters, you don't speak for us.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:57.602]  And we also have Colonel Al Rodriguez, retired decorated war veteran, coming on to speak out against these illegal aliens and the people that control them.
[01:58:58.266 --> 01:58:59.827]  Again, we're not against most of these immigrants.
[01:58:59.847 --> 01:59:06.889]  The problem is they're being filled with anti-American hate, and they're controlled by a big Fortune 500 PR firm as a way to break down the U.S.
[01:59:06.929 --> 01:59:08.089]  and break down our sovereignty.
[01:59:08.249 --> 01:59:09.310]  It's called globalization.
[01:59:09.730 --> 01:59:12.531]  I want to move quick through your calls, Mark, Joe, Don, Michael, and others.
[01:59:12.911 --> 01:59:14.451]  Mark in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:59:14.491 --> 01:59:14.951]  Go ahead.
[01:59:15.732 --> 01:59:16.852]  Alex, what's going on, buddy?
[01:59:17.232 --> 01:59:18.532]  Doing a live radio show, my friend.
[01:59:19.333 --> 01:59:22.774]  Hey, I just wanted to say, as far as the...
[01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:33.182]  The concentration camps, you had an article posted on your website about KPR, I think it was $396 million no-bid contract to create...
[01:59:34.246 --> 01:59:35.767]  Okay, well I want to get your opinion.
[01:59:35.807 --> 01:59:37.508]  Now I think it's an example of the Hegelian dialectic.
[01:59:37.548 --> 01:59:37.748]  I think
[02:00:02.538 --> 02:00:04.659]  But I want to see which way you think it's going to go.
[02:00:04.719 --> 02:00:13.383]  Yes, Rex 84 openly in 1986 was declassified, and it admittedly was going to use a huge influx of illegal aliens as the pretext to build the camps.
[02:00:13.723 --> 02:00:14.544]  They'll then put U.S.
[02:00:14.584 --> 02:00:18.866]  citizens in them, and now they're openly saying that the KBR camps are for the illegal aliens.
[02:00:19.126 --> 02:00:20.887]  So Rex 84 is being implemented.
[02:00:20.907 --> 02:00:21.267]  Go ahead.
[02:00:21.987 --> 02:00:28.250]  Well, I was going to say, do you think they'll use maybe a combination of this bullcrap bird flu
[02:00:29.385 --> 02:00:33.327]  To justify it, or do you think they'll use the immigration thing, or maybe both?
[02:00:33.947 --> 02:00:39.669]  Well, it's like an old Mission Impossible episode where the guy's got an exploding capsule put in his brain.
[02:00:40.049 --> 02:00:42.030]  If he doesn't follow orders, they'll detonate it.
[02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:48.892]  The globalists can launch an atomic attack and blame it on whoever they want to have total martial law, and Tommy Frank says they're getting ready for it.
[02:00:49.412 --> 02:00:50.953]  They can launch bird flu and do it.
[02:00:51.293 --> 02:00:55.635]  They can have the same PR outfit, tell the illegals to riot.
[02:00:55.835 --> 02:00:57.576]  They'll burn down every major city.
[02:00:57.856 --> 02:01:00.798]  They've got big plaques saying they want to have a violent overthrow.
[02:01:00.898 --> 02:01:01.778]  I've seen it physically.
[02:01:02.038 --> 02:01:03.139]  I've witnessed the plaques.
[02:01:03.599 --> 02:01:04.560]  So they can do that.
[02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:06.761]  They can release smallpox.
[02:01:06.821 --> 02:01:07.801]  It can come out of left field.
[02:01:07.841 --> 02:01:09.042]  It can be a chemical release.
[02:01:09.382 --> 02:01:13.264]  Or it can be a few small attacks drilling us to get us ready for the big one.
[02:01:13.384 --> 02:01:13.864]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:14.165 --> 02:01:18.927]  So they've got all sorts of little capsules in the brain of America that they can detonate.
[02:01:19.949 --> 02:01:24.174]  Well, so probably here's what I foresee happening if they use the illegal aliens.
[02:01:25.155 --> 02:01:29.180]  They will precipitate some sort of violent riots on their part.
[02:01:31.182 --> 02:01:40.813]  Real Americans or citizens will try to defend themselves using firearms and they'll come in exactly like they did during Katrina and say no one will be allowed to have firearms.
[02:01:41.303 --> 02:01:44.165]  And they'll sweep up the potential patriots.
[02:01:44.205 --> 02:01:51.370]  Oh, they've said during race riots or during bio-attacks or during crises, the main mission isn't bringing food and water, it's taking your guns.
[02:01:51.730 --> 02:01:54.051]  It's like what happened in the L.A.
[02:01:54.131 --> 02:01:54.411]  riots.
[02:01:54.472 --> 02:01:58.354]  Remember how it was the Korean shopkeepers that defended themselves?
[02:01:58.414 --> 02:01:59.635]  The police just stood down?
[02:02:00.447 --> 02:02:00.627]  Yes.
[02:02:00.948 --> 02:02:04.130]  Well, they're going to let a riot run for four or five days, a week, two weeks.
[02:02:04.491 --> 02:02:06.933]  When it settles down, the cops aren't going to come help you.
[02:02:07.133 --> 02:02:09.816]  Guaranteed, they're coming for your guns.
[02:02:10.136 --> 02:02:11.217]  They've openly said it, sir.
[02:02:12.178 --> 02:02:12.458]  Okay.
[02:02:12.898 --> 02:02:14.079]  Well, I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:02:14.099 --> 02:02:15.360]  That's kind of what I thought.
[02:02:17.222 --> 02:02:17.502]  Thank you.
[02:02:17.542 --> 02:02:23.147]  And good law-abiding Americans will be fools and will hand their guns in to the cops.
[02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:25.790]  I mean, they'll love it.
[02:02:27.523 --> 02:02:28.445]  The troops will come in.
[02:02:28.465 --> 02:02:30.247]  Do I need to play that clip again of them taking the guns?
[02:02:31.069 --> 02:02:32.030]  They revel in it.
[02:02:34.173 --> 02:02:37.458]  It's so horrible, and I don't want to be at the throat of all these illegal aliens.
[02:02:37.518 --> 02:02:41.244]  I know most of them aren't bad people, but the movement itself is bad.
[02:02:41.985 --> 02:02:42.686]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:42.726 --> 02:02:43.127]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:49.572]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.832 --> 02:02:51.414]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.754 --> 02:02:56.437]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.758 --> 02:03:03.503]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.823 --> 02:03:05.805]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.005 --> 02:03:08.868]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.948 --> 02:03:13.612]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.832 --> 02:03:18.216]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.456 --> 02:03:25.703]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:04:47.276 --> 02:04:49.857]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:50.017 --> 02:04:52.178]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:52.438 --> 02:05:02.541]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:05:02.861 --> 02:05:05.182]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[02:05:05.362 --> 02:05:09.463]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[02:05:09.663 --> 02:05:15.365]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.
[02:05:15.705 --> 02:05:20.286]  Earth friendly, pure soaps for bathing, laundry and kitchen.
[02:05:20.466 --> 02:05:23.827]  Try pure soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:05:24.128 --> 02:05:29.049]  Now for the first time, Cal Bend Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:05:29.309 --> 02:05:32.852]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:32.872 --> 02:05:34.734]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.739 --> 02:06:08.026]  Coming up in just about seven minutes, Colonel Al Rodriguez, decorated war veteran, Hispanic Coalition tells illegal alien protesters, you don't speak for me.
[02:06:08.626 --> 02:06:09.907]  This was just live on C-SPAN.
[02:06:09.967 --> 02:06:18.753]  So we're going to be talking to Mr. Rodriguez as well as Susan Wioski, one of the coordinators.
[02:06:19.214 --> 02:06:20.434]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[02:06:20.554 --> 02:06:22.095]  Joe, where are you calling us from today?
[02:06:22.496 --> 02:06:23.136]  I'm in Kansas.
[02:06:23.216 --> 02:06:23.657]  Can you hear me?
[02:06:23.817 --> 02:06:24.237]  Yes, I can.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:25.280]  Thanks.
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:26.842]  A couple points I'd like to cover.
[02:06:27.602 --> 02:06:32.106]  One, in Kansas here, we're trying to find good candidates to run on these issues in November.
[02:06:32.586 --> 02:06:40.492]  If they could contact us quickly, we could see if they want to run for state rep or Congress or county commissioners.
[02:06:40.552 --> 02:06:42.014]  All of these are very important races.
[02:06:42.134 --> 02:06:46.497]  I don't have a problem with advocacy, but if I just get random calls saying, we're a group, call us.
[02:06:46.577 --> 02:06:48.058]  What's your group?
[02:06:48.359 --> 02:06:49.860]  This is the Reform Party of Kansas.
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:52.422]  We're a ballot access party in Kansas.
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:57.143]  And so people need to join you if they want to run on the issue of our borders?
[02:06:57.443 --> 02:07:06.049]  If they want to run for office on our ballot access, then yes, they would register a form, and then our nominating caucus is in about a month.
[02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:08.311]  Joe, is there a website?
[02:07:08.391 --> 02:07:14.336]  Our contact information is on our website, VoteKansas.org.
[02:07:14.516 --> 02:07:16.678]  Well, that's a good address, VoteKansas.org.
[02:07:16.718 --> 02:07:17.358]  Fantastic.
[02:07:17.558 --> 02:07:18.559]  What else is on your mind, Joe?
[02:07:18.579 --> 02:07:23.643]  All right, well, at the counter, this supposed boycott of Gringo products...
[02:07:24.632 --> 02:07:31.898]  By the way, that's the real name of the demonstrations, and then the media spends it and says, a day without immigrants.
[02:07:32.178 --> 02:07:35.600]  The media won't even tell the citizens what this is being called by the illegals.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:35.961]  Right.
[02:07:36.561 --> 02:07:46.168]  Well, so instead of don't buy from Gringo, our Americans that are trying to support Americans, if you just go to the store, half the stuff you find or more is going to be from China.
[02:07:46.561 --> 02:07:54.017]  If you want to support real American companies, buy from GCN and your radio shows and the sponsors of your radio shows this day or this week.
[02:07:55.357 --> 02:07:56.077]  I agree with you.
[02:07:56.117 --> 02:07:59.278]  We need to support the few American-made products that are left.
[02:07:59.298 --> 02:08:01.279]  That's why we sell Big Berkey's Made in America.
[02:08:01.639 --> 02:08:04.719]  We promote Calvin Pure Organic Soap, Made in America.
[02:08:05.159 --> 02:08:07.380]  My documentary films are Made in America.
[02:08:08.100 --> 02:08:11.101]  You cannot find the plastic cases for the Made in America.
[02:08:11.161 --> 02:08:17.503]  Those are not, but they're produced and made here in the U.S., which is most of the value of the product.
[02:08:17.843 --> 02:08:22.324]  My t-shirts are Made in America, so instead of $2 a piece, they're literally $5 to $6 a piece.
[02:08:23.804 --> 02:08:25.765]  So we try to put our money where our mouth is.
[02:08:25.805 --> 02:08:26.846]  Thank you so much, Joe.
[02:08:27.086 --> 02:08:27.266]  Thanks.
[02:08:27.987 --> 02:08:38.113]  Now imagine if we got on air, and black people did, or whites did, or Hispanics who love America, the majority got on and said, don't go to Mexican food restaurants run by illegals.
[02:08:38.533 --> 02:08:40.814]  Don't boycott restaurants run by illegals.
[02:08:41.115 --> 02:08:42.936]  Don't go to stores that hire illegals.
[02:08:42.996 --> 02:08:45.157]  Don't buy from the illegals.
[02:08:45.417 --> 02:08:47.478]  And didn't even use a racial term like gringo.
[02:08:47.859 --> 02:08:48.799]  It'd be horrible.
[02:08:48.879 --> 02:08:49.620]  It'd be racist.
[02:08:49.680 --> 02:08:50.720]  It'd be all over the news.
[02:08:51.281 --> 02:08:51.441]  But...
[02:08:52.461 --> 02:09:01.104]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Kansas City.
[02:09:01.124 --> 02:09:01.804]  Go ahead, Don.
[02:09:02.285 --> 02:09:02.725]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:03.845 --> 02:09:09.287]  I wish I could have gotten to the phone quicker and talked to Mr. Schumer about this because he knew Michael Schiavo so well.
[02:09:10.748 --> 02:09:17.770]  I don't remember the details of this case like I did a year ago back when it was raging, but something struck me as very curious.
[02:09:17.890 --> 02:09:20.531]  All these very powerful people going to the mat for this guy.
[02:09:21.406 --> 02:09:23.867]  A great public relations risk to them.
[02:09:23.887 --> 02:09:34.370]  I wondered if perhaps, was there something more here than just a right to die or euthanasia exercise or an attempted murder cover-up by Schiavo?
[02:09:34.990 --> 02:09:42.553]  I was wondering if this guy may be an intelligence asset and that Terry Schiavo was his little personal perk or slave or...
[02:09:43.288 --> 02:09:45.530]  Or part of a mind control experiment.
[02:09:45.590 --> 02:09:47.651]  Well, I don't really like to speculate, Don.
[02:09:47.671 --> 02:09:49.152]  That's a pretty wild speculation.
[02:09:49.212 --> 02:09:50.413]  But my guest is here.
[02:09:50.433 --> 02:09:51.193]  I've got to let you go.
[02:09:51.614 --> 02:09:52.494]  Thank you for the call.
[02:09:53.275 --> 02:10:00.339]  Okay, we are now joined, and they just had a national press conference, by just some amazing folks.
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:03.522]  And, of course, Susan Wioski joins us first.
[02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:08.965]  And we're going to be talking to Colonel Al Rodriguez, retired and, of course, decorated war veteran.
[02:10:09.586 --> 02:10:11.387]  Susan, tell us about what happened today.
[02:10:11.407 --> 02:10:13.028]  You guys are cowering the propaganda.
[02:10:13.832 --> 02:10:14.412]  Absolutely.
[02:10:14.472 --> 02:10:17.693]  Well, this is actually Susan Wysocki, I should just correct you.
[02:10:17.993 --> 02:10:22.615]  Wysocki, excuse me, I can't... That's quite all right, a tough Polish name.
[02:10:22.695 --> 02:10:42.861]  But we had a tremendous media circus here, finally getting the other side of the story out there and telling people that the Hispanic community is not a monolithic voice, that they are not getting the other side of the story, that there are lots of divergent opinions in the Hispanic community that want the American public and the media to know that
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:54.928]  All of the protesters marching in the streets that are making unreasonable demands on our government who are here illegally and breaking the cardinal rule of entry as their first act in entering the United States don't speak for the Hispanic community.
[02:10:57.322 --> 02:11:07.831]  Well, I know that in major polls, almost 70% of Hispanics are against the open borders, and now in major polls, 87% to 91% of Americans averaged together are against it.
[02:11:08.251 --> 02:11:10.513]  Are you guys aware that Dallas Morning News and L.A.
[02:11:10.533 --> 02:11:20.881]  Times and AP have all reported, but it's never gotten big national coverage, that a Bush-slash-Fox PR firm out of Dallas has staged this entire thing?
[02:11:21.642 --> 02:11:24.865]  Well, that's what we've heard, and there have obviously been connections to...
[02:11:25.424 --> 02:11:28.427]  Several Marxist organizations, communist organizations.
[02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:29.849]  Well, this is May Day today.
[02:11:30.389 --> 02:11:30.910]  Absolutely.
[02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:36.215]  There's no surprise that they chose May Day as the day to stage this event.
[02:11:37.156 --> 02:11:46.766]  There have been reports of mass groups handing out signs from vans to people who don't know what they're protesting against.
[02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:52.747]  What did you think of Cargill coming out and saying, we're telling our employees not to come in Monday.
[02:11:53.087 --> 02:11:58.388]  I mean, big corporations working in tandem with the illegal invaders telling them to go out and demonstrate.
[02:11:58.408 --> 02:12:08.751]  I mean, you don't see corporations telling citizens to go demonstrate and take the day off for property rights or go demonstrate and take the day off for the Second Amendment, but something anti-American you do.
[02:12:09.571 --> 02:12:11.751]  Well, it actually wasn't even just Cargill.
[02:12:11.771 --> 02:12:14.172]  It was Seaboard Foods, Tyson Foods, Hormel Foods,
[02:12:14.508 --> 02:12:30.418]  We actually asked people not to buy meat today as a way to protest companies that support illegal immigration, because they're making money off the backs of illegal immigrants who are here not working and not even earning a fair wage at the expense of the American worker and driving down American wages by something like a billion dollars every year.
[02:12:30.438 --> 02:12:31.038]  I agree.
[02:12:31.058 --> 02:12:32.259]  Tell us about what happened today.
[02:12:32.299 --> 02:12:34.861]  Tell us about your press conference, and I want to talk to Colonel Al Rodriguez.
[02:12:35.401 --> 02:12:35.721]  Sure.
[02:12:36.622 --> 02:12:40.885]  Well, basically, the press conference today was just a way of showing solidarity for the
[02:12:44.102 --> 02:12:49.406]  And giving a voice to the other side of the story so that people understand, again, that this is not a one-sided issue.
[02:12:49.426 --> 02:13:12.462]  What we've seen is only the protests in the streets and not the other side of the issue where you're hearing Hispanic Americans saying that they don't agree with Bush's policies and they don't agree with an open borders policy and they don't agree with amnesty or guest worker programs and they believe that there are not just two solutions to this issue, either mass deportation or mass amnesty, that there is a third option
[02:13:12.867 --> 02:13:31.039]  The attrition option where we enforce the laws that are actually on the books and punish corporate employers like we were promised under the 1986 amnesty and enforce those rules so that you will get a situation of self-attrition and you'll start to see people self-patriating to their home countries when the job magnet dries up.
[02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:34.421]  Can I speak to Colonel Al Rodriguez, please?
[02:13:34.461 --> 02:13:34.702]  Sure.
[02:13:34.942 --> 02:13:35.462]  Absolutely.
[02:13:35.502 --> 02:13:36.062]  He's right here.
[02:13:36.503 --> 02:13:36.783]  Thank you.
[02:13:43.312 --> 02:13:44.692]  Colonel, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:13:45.433 --> 02:13:47.113]  Sure, no problem.
[02:13:48.694 --> 02:13:50.994]  Tell us about the organization and what you guys did today.
[02:13:52.275 --> 02:14:09.960]  I think we had a good group in front of several reporters and TV media telling them what our feelings were as far as the illegal movement is concerned.
[02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:12.389]  I thought it went very well.
[02:14:12.409 --> 02:14:20.911]  It was some very professional people speaking on behalf of what we call our country, America.
[02:14:21.291 --> 02:14:24.192]  Well, we saw it on C-SPAN just a few hours ago.
[02:14:24.232 --> 02:14:26.193]  That's why we contacted you and had you on.
[02:14:26.573 --> 02:14:28.653]  What made you get involved in this organization?
[02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:35.855]  Tell us about the organization, and then give us your take on these illegal aliens running around saying that this is Aslan.
[02:14:37.087 --> 02:14:38.188]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:14:39.148 --> 02:14:41.709]  You better stop believing what they're talking about.
[02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:50.833]  I don't think it'll ever come to fruition, but I'll tell you, there's a lot that do really believe that that's where they're going.
[02:14:51.594 --> 02:15:03.679]  And consequently, that's why they've got so many illegals over here bringing more and more and more every day because they believe that eventually all the Southwest and Northwest
[02:15:04.241 --> 02:15:07.302]  Well, again, revert back to Mexico.
[02:15:07.642 --> 02:15:16.404]  And I think they're so damn foolish in thinking that that I don't know where they're coming from.
[02:15:17.264 --> 02:15:18.944]  The organization, we just started it.
[02:15:19.964 --> 02:15:28.006]  It started, you asked this question, it started, as far as I'm concerned, and I guess maybe I'm at fault in starting it,
[02:15:29.138 --> 02:15:39.406]  By the flag that was raised up with the Mexican flag on top of the flagpole and the American flag upside down with California.
[02:15:39.426 --> 02:15:42.269]  Same situation happened in Arizona.
[02:15:43.029 --> 02:15:45.731]  And I carry that picture with me to show it around.
[02:15:45.771 --> 02:15:49.915]  Don't forget we have a bunch of beverage.
[02:15:50.135 --> 02:15:50.475]  Hello?
[02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:52.557]  Yes, sir, we're here.
[02:15:52.617 --> 02:15:54.098]  Your cell phone's cutting out, but go ahead.
[02:15:55.624 --> 02:16:04.928]  We have a lot of veterans that have served this great nation of ours, and I guess you're taping it, which is all right.
[02:16:06.989 --> 02:16:16.772]  We have a lot of veterans that are completely upset, profoundly upset at that flag being flown over our country.
[02:16:17.453 --> 02:16:20.674]  So I guess that's what inspired me to get involved with this.
[02:16:21.932 --> 02:16:23.133]  Well, that's beautiful, sir.
[02:16:23.413 --> 02:16:30.479]  I mean, I have so many Hispanic friends, and when I talk to the radical loricanquistas, they laugh and say, no, you don't, you're a racist gringo.
[02:16:30.499 --> 02:16:32.020]  And I'm like, no, I'm not.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:42.248]  It's like this self-righteous America-hating, we're taking over, and then it creates division between blacks, whites, and Hispanics when we haven't been fighting with each other.
[02:16:42.508 --> 02:16:43.649]  We're just Americans.
[02:16:44.110 --> 02:16:45.291]  That's exactly right.
[02:16:46.011 --> 02:16:47.773]  And that's exactly the way we feel.
[02:16:47.853 --> 02:16:51.897]  If they start calling you racist, tell them, how about Mexico?
[02:16:52.337 --> 02:16:56.241]  Mexico is one of the most racist countries in the world, in case you don't know it.
[02:16:57.001 --> 02:16:58.543]  I was aware of that, but we're going to break, sir.
[02:16:58.563 --> 02:17:00.545]  I'd like to come back and hear you tell us about that.
[02:17:01.025 --> 02:17:03.127]  I mean, look at what they do to illegal immigrants there.
[02:17:03.608 --> 02:17:10.054]  But, I mean, here we're just supposed to... I don't understand how some of the illegals from Mexico, why they hate America so much.
[02:17:10.094 --> 02:17:12.616]  I mean, don't they know Mexico's horribly corrupt?
[02:17:13.849 --> 02:17:18.892]  Actually, what they ought to be doing is they ought to go to Mexico and fight for the rights over there.
[02:17:20.352 --> 02:17:22.793]  I agree with you, Colonel Al Rodriguez.
[02:17:22.833 --> 02:17:24.054]  Can you stay with us through the break?
[02:17:25.715 --> 02:17:26.555]  Sure, why not?
[02:17:26.915 --> 02:17:27.856]  Okay, it's a quick break.
[02:17:27.876 --> 02:17:30.677]  We'll come right back to you and talk about any issues you wish to discuss.
[02:17:31.257 --> 02:17:32.538]  Hey, they did more than talk about it.
[02:17:32.578 --> 02:17:37.200]  They started an organization, and boom, now they're on national television getting the word out.
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:38.941]  That's what a lot of you need to do.
[02:17:39.701 --> 02:17:40.522]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:40.582 --> 02:17:42.983]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're not going to back off from it.
[02:17:45.754 --> 02:17:46.334]  We're good to go.
[02:17:46.354 --> 02:17:47.035]  We're good to go.
[02:18:13.626 --> 02:18:14.187]  We're good to go.
[02:18:33.087 --> 02:18:34.488]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:34.508 --> 02:18:35.169]  One and the same.
[02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:36.290]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[02:18:59.542 --> 02:19:05.005]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.445 --> 02:19:08.566]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:08.826 --> 02:19:10.667]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:10.747 --> 02:19:13.749]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:13.849 --> 02:19:16.510]  Here is reality.
[02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:20.432]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:24.614]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:25.174 --> 02:19:27.996]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[02:19:29.358 --> 02:19:29.938]  We're good to go.
[02:19:30.059 --> 02:19:30.379]  I think?
[02:19:58.064 --> 02:19:58.464]  We're good to go.
[02:20:24.955 --> 02:20:27.438]  Just call our toll-free order line number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.458 --> 02:20:28.259]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:28.279 --> 02:20:28.539]  Call now.
[02:20:28.599 --> 02:20:32.324]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:45.859 --> 02:20:52.722]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:20:52.862 --> 02:21:05.806]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:05.966 --> 02:21:07.747]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:07.927 --> 02:21:08.307]  We're good to go.
[02:21:27.156 --> 02:21:30.317]  We're talking to one of the founders of a new organization called
[02:21:55.575 --> 02:21:57.776]  You don't speak for me, Hispanic Coalition.
[02:21:59.417 --> 02:22:02.599]  And he's a highly decorated veteran, Colonel Al Rodriguez.
[02:22:02.619 --> 02:22:03.439]  They just started the group.
[02:22:03.459 --> 02:22:04.640]  They were just on C-SPAN.
[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:08.002]  And more and more organizations like this are being started up.
[02:22:09.044 --> 02:22:12.685]  Understand, folks, the population of Mexico has doubled in the last 35 years.
[02:22:13.526 --> 02:22:15.046]  NAFTA has destroyed the country.
[02:22:15.066 --> 02:22:16.707]  They're all trying to move up here.
[02:22:17.067 --> 02:22:19.208]  And then they come up and say, this is Mexico.
[02:22:19.248 --> 02:22:26.070]  Well, they've got a problem, because most Hispanic Americans, who are just as patriotic or more so than anybody out there, are getting really mad.
[02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:30.452]  In fact, per capita, statistically, the Army will tell you this, so will the Marine Corps.
[02:22:30.472 --> 02:22:31.672]  This is an official statistic.
[02:22:32.805 --> 02:22:37.288]  Hispanic Americans are more highly decorated than anybody in our modern U.S.
[02:22:37.328 --> 02:22:42.451]  military history since World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, Gulf War II.
[02:22:42.471 --> 02:22:45.153]  They're incredibly patriotic people.
[02:22:45.893 --> 02:22:52.137]  Sir, tell us about your military past and when you finally got upset when you saw the American flag being desecrated.
[02:22:52.157 --> 02:22:53.237]  They've also been burning it.
[02:22:53.698 --> 02:22:57.180]  And why you guys started this organization and what you're planning to do.
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:22:59.181]  Okay.
[02:22:59.281 --> 02:23:00.422]  First of all, you're 100% right.
[02:23:00.442 --> 02:23:00.702]  There's...
[02:23:02.662 --> 02:23:16.706]  Quite a few American Hispanics, American First and Hispanics Next, that have served in the military, and yes, they have been very, very highly awarded as far as their service is concerned.
[02:23:17.486 --> 02:23:25.268]  And why do we have quite a number of American Hispanics in the armed services?
[02:23:25.829 --> 02:23:29.590]  It's only because they're patriotic, and they believe in this nation.
[02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.290]  And...
[02:23:31.928 --> 02:23:33.669]  We believe in the rule of law.
[02:23:34.149 --> 02:23:48.133]  And when these individuals come over to our country and attempt to fly their flag on a flagpole with an American flag upside down, that would aggravate anyone.
[02:23:48.153 --> 02:23:53.755]  And the veterans are profoundly aggravated at this.
[02:23:54.838 --> 02:23:57.880]  So, that's more or less why I got involved in this.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:08.645]  The flag picture that came out in Whittier, California, high school, with the Mexican flag on top of the flagpole and the American flag upside down on the bottom.
[02:24:09.206 --> 02:24:16.489]  Same situation happening in my home state of Arizona, in Apache Junction, Arizona.
[02:24:16.509 --> 02:24:19.231]  A young individual,
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:25.101]  That belonged to the junior ROTC program in the Pacific High School.
[02:24:26.361 --> 02:24:37.244]  They rented a flagpole for their ceremonial services that they had and attempted to raise a Mexican flag on that flagpole.
[02:24:37.684 --> 02:24:39.244]  Well, they made a mistake.
[02:24:39.884 --> 02:24:45.245]  This young man by himself took the flag down, the Mexican flag down, and burned it.
[02:24:45.805 --> 02:24:46.506]  But guess what?
[02:24:46.726 --> 02:24:48.086]  Guess who got punished?
[02:24:48.567 --> 02:24:51.968]  The individual American that took the flag down and burned it.
[02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:55.190]  Nothing was said about those that were attempting to put it up.
[02:24:56.390 --> 02:25:02.493]  This aggravated me and that's why I got involved in this movement and watch us go.
[02:25:03.033 --> 02:25:11.556]  Watch us bring in the American Hispanics throughout the nation that do believe in this great nation of ours.
[02:25:14.275 --> 02:25:17.396]  Yeah, build this country.
[02:25:17.436 --> 02:25:19.037]  Well, what about Congressman Bonilla?
[02:25:19.137 --> 02:25:22.558]  I mean, he's down in San Antonio, and his district goes down to the border.
[02:25:22.858 --> 02:25:25.219]  He's saying the exact same thing that you're saying.
[02:25:25.639 --> 02:25:26.659]  And I'm surprised.
[02:25:26.699 --> 02:25:29.480]  Bonilla, I guarantee you he'll be joining.
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:30.320]  I know Bonilla.
[02:25:31.161 --> 02:25:35.182]  I've had conversations with him several times.
[02:25:35.775 --> 02:25:37.336]  And he is saying the same thing.
[02:25:37.716 --> 02:25:39.617]  What if he's saying the same thing?
[02:25:39.917 --> 02:25:44.399]  I want to look at you specifically as the archetypal patriotic American.
[02:25:44.659 --> 02:25:48.821]  Tell us a little bit about your service to the country and what you've done for this nation.
[02:25:49.682 --> 02:26:00.227]  Well, going back to my retirement years, I was assigned as a military attache in the country of El Salvador.
[02:26:01.047 --> 02:26:04.669]  And that was under the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[02:26:05.288 --> 02:26:24.566]  I served in the Pentagon with a foreign liaison office, which comes under the Assistant Secretary, excuse me, Intelligence Officer of the Pentagon, and served a couple of tours in Vietnam, and that's about the extent of my...
[02:26:26.194 --> 02:26:30.336]  Army service, although I spent 31 years and five months in the Army.
[02:26:30.537 --> 02:26:33.198]  Sir, you've talked to these illegal aliens, I would imagine.
[02:26:33.438 --> 02:26:35.759]  Why do some of them hate America so much?
[02:26:35.779 --> 02:26:38.541]  I mean, why do they think America going down is a good idea?
[02:26:39.481 --> 02:26:41.382]  Well, you know what?
[02:26:41.462 --> 02:26:42.283]  It's not all of them.
[02:26:42.883 --> 02:26:44.444]  No, I know that.
[02:26:44.744 --> 02:26:46.385]  It's just a few of them.
[02:26:46.965 --> 02:26:50.727]  What you do when they tell you that, here's what I tell them.
[02:26:51.728 --> 02:26:52.448]  We don't hate you.
[02:26:53.072 --> 02:26:55.873]  Your own worst enemy is Mexico.
[02:26:56.274 --> 02:27:01.016]  That is who is hurting you, and that is your enemy, and that's a fact.
[02:27:01.996 --> 02:27:08.479]  Mexico is one of the richest little countries in the world, yet all the people are running out of there trying to escape what?
[02:27:08.699 --> 02:27:09.220]  Slavery?
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.181]  It's got triple the oil we do.
[02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:18.341]  Well, it's about, I think, fifth or sixth major oil producer in the world.
[02:27:18.801 --> 02:27:23.062]  And I don't know if it's not number one major natural gas producer.
[02:27:23.562 --> 02:27:30.743]  Gold, silver, tin, some of the best agricultural lands.
[02:27:30.783 --> 02:27:31.543]  Stay there, Colonel.
[02:27:31.783 --> 02:27:34.644]  Colonel Al Rodriguez will be back with the final segment, and we'll take your calls.
[02:27:35.804 --> 02:27:36.744]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.184 --> 02:27:38.844]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.864 --> 02:27:42.385]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.848 --> 02:27:52.252]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.532 --> 02:27:57.234]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:57.555 --> 02:28:05.219]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.499 --> 02:28:12.343]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.563 --> 02:28:13.964]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:14.104 --> 02:28:14.604]  We're good to go.
[02:28:38.357 --> 02:28:41.259]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:41.599 --> 02:28:45.361]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:46.742 --> 02:28:49.704]  The Berkey Light is your premier source of purified water.
[02:28:50.084 --> 02:28:58.910]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:03.893]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.373 --> 02:29:11.095]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.495 --> 02:29:23.279]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.739 --> 02:29:28.204]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:28.385 --> 02:29:30.848]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:30.868 --> 02:29:32.509]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:32.590 --> 02:29:33.911]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:33.991 --> 02:29:35.453]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:35.473 --> 02:29:36.474]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:46.542 --> 02:29:47.362]  Come on, Bill.
[02:29:47.582 --> 02:29:49.423]  Two weeks ago, you were riding the bicycle.
[02:29:49.603 --> 02:29:52.764]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:29:53.104 --> 02:29:53.664]  What did you do?
[02:29:53.764 --> 02:29:54.584]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:29:54.684 --> 02:29:55.404]  No, John.
[02:29:55.464 --> 02:29:56.665]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:29:56.945 --> 02:30:02.466]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:02.746 --> 02:30:09.008]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:09.348 --> 02:30:11.548]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:11.848 --> 02:30:12.448]  And get this.
[02:30:12.648 --> 02:30:14.709]  They guarantee my success in writing.
[02:30:15.209 --> 02:30:18.672]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:30:18.892 --> 02:30:19.312]  Whoa.
[02:30:19.693 --> 02:30:20.913]  What was that website again?
[02:30:20.994 --> 02:30:24.476]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:30:24.776 --> 02:30:25.877]  Now write this down, John.
[02:30:26.017 --> 02:30:30.320]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:30:30.481 --> 02:30:31.061]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:30:31.341 --> 02:30:32.522]  I'm going there right now.
[02:30:32.942 --> 02:30:33.583]  Check, please.
[02:30:35.386 --> 02:30:36.807]  Uh, you got this one, right Bill?
[02:30:37.287 --> 02:30:37.887]  Sure, John.
[02:30:38.108 --> 02:30:42.510]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:44.471]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:30:44.651 --> 02:30:44.931]  Deal.
[02:30:49.096 --> 02:30:49.636]  Don't worry.
[02:30:50.077 --> 02:30:51.638]  This show is documented.
[02:30:52.118 --> 02:30:58.802]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:58.822 --> 02:31:04.825]  They've started an organization, and they're taking action.
[02:31:05.846 --> 02:31:09.248]  We're extremely honored to have them with us today.
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:15.643]  Hispanic Coalition tells illegal alien protesters, you don't speak for me.
[02:31:15.683 --> 02:31:19.526]  And they're going to call it the You Don't Speak For Me Hispanic Coalition.
[02:31:19.546 --> 02:31:30.652]  And that's so important because you look at Gallup polls, 67% of Hispanic Americans, and that's illegals, legals, citizens, they average it all together, are against the open borders.
[02:31:31.453 --> 02:31:37.036]  And then you look at the numbers of Hispanic Americans, it's in the high 80s just like it is with every other major ethnic group.
[02:31:37.337 --> 02:31:39.438]  But then the media, CNN, even Fox,
[02:31:40.401 --> 02:31:49.470]  It behaves like if you're Hispanic, you need to stand with Hispanics and you need to be for total amnesty and all these other programs.
[02:31:50.511 --> 02:31:54.556]  And at the same time, it creates all this tension.
[02:31:55.557 --> 02:31:58.620]  It's just a horrible thing that's happening in our nation.
[02:32:00.313 --> 02:32:07.395]  Going back to our guest who joins us, Colonel Allen Rodriguez, I just finished a big press conference that was carried live on C-SPAN nationally.
[02:32:07.675 --> 02:32:09.016]  I saw it during some of the breaks.
[02:32:09.056 --> 02:32:10.256]  I couldn't watch the whole thing.
[02:32:10.596 --> 02:32:14.398]  What were some of the things that you talked about, Colonel Rodriguez, at the press conference?
[02:32:15.338 --> 02:32:27.182]  Well, I focused mostly on what our veterans have done here for this great nation of ours and how they're being affected by...
[02:32:28.092 --> 02:32:42.420]  The legal community in the United States of America, and one, of course, is specifically the flag raising and Mexican flags and check a lot of flags in these big protests that they're having.
[02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:43.941]  I don't know what they're trying to prove.
[02:32:44.581 --> 02:32:51.245]  And I talked about the number of veterans we have in America at this juncture, and
[02:32:52.518 --> 02:33:06.760]  If you take the Hispanics that have served with the Armed Forces of the United States of America, do you really think that they're going to be supporting illegal aliens when they react in that manner?
[02:33:07.734 --> 02:33:12.417]  We are a law-abiding country, and that's the way we want to keep it.
[02:33:12.677 --> 02:33:17.941]  Well, Colonel, the protesting has been going on for four weeks now, and they can't unring that bell.
[02:33:18.361 --> 02:33:26.387]  The first week and a half, it was 90-1 Mexican, El Salvador, Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, Panamanian flags.
[02:33:26.407 --> 02:33:28.849]  Now they served out all the American flags.
[02:33:30.010 --> 02:33:35.456]  But still, I think that really backfired on the Larry Conquista crowd.
[02:33:35.516 --> 02:33:45.827]  Now, I had the National Director Al Garza of the Minutemen on, and he said in Arizona, it's almost all the illegals that think this is a reconquering of the Southwest.
[02:33:45.867 --> 02:33:47.649]  You say it's a minority.
[02:33:47.749 --> 02:33:49.111]  I tend to more agree with you.
[02:33:49.731 --> 02:34:01.433]  But of that minority, that minority that hates America is predominantly the leadership of these amnesty groups, these sanctuary groups.
[02:34:01.813 --> 02:34:02.534]  I've interviewed them.
[02:34:02.574 --> 02:34:03.254]  I've talked to them.
[02:34:03.494 --> 02:34:05.494]  You hit it right on the head.
[02:34:06.374 --> 02:34:08.075]  You hit it right on the head.
[02:34:08.095 --> 02:34:09.575]  That's who it is.
[02:34:10.135 --> 02:34:13.696]  And that's who's promoting all these illegals to do what they're doing.
[02:34:14.236 --> 02:34:19.017]  And consequently, hopefully they continue carrying flags, I understand, on this protest.
[02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:23.999]  And by the way, this is Commie Day, isn't it?
[02:34:24.599 --> 02:34:26.700]  And they're doing it in the Commie Day.
[02:34:26.720 --> 02:34:27.760]  Why?
[02:34:27.881 --> 02:34:32.923]  We're in trouble with these folks if we continue receiving any more illegals in the nation.
[02:34:33.523 --> 02:34:39.926]  And what bothers the heck out of me is that Congress and the White House do not react.
[02:34:43.078 --> 02:34:45.839]  Well, I mean, I've been in demonstrations for a decade.
[02:34:45.919 --> 02:34:50.400]  You will see signs showing the Southwest and the name Aslan.
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:54.061]  You will see signs saying, violent revolution is needed.
[02:34:54.521 --> 02:34:56.341]  Have you heard of the Plan of San Diego?
[02:34:56.361 --> 02:35:06.504]  You'll see t-shirts saying, we need to implement the Plan of San Diego, which the German government, World War I, funded in South Texas, a plan of ethnic cleansing and race war.
[02:35:07.664 --> 02:35:10.585]  Were you aware, sir, that they have the Plan of San Diego shirts?
[02:35:11.577 --> 02:35:12.678]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:12.698 --> 02:35:13.919]  Let me tell you, though.
[02:35:14.659 --> 02:35:19.282]  If there is a violent revolution needed, it's needed in Mexico.
[02:35:19.963 --> 02:35:39.075]  And that's where the illegals have to turn their focus on and have a violent revolution to bring down the corrupt government of Mexico that is using them, the illegals, as slaves to
[02:35:45.057 --> 02:35:46.117]  Well, I agree with you, sir.
[02:35:46.157 --> 02:35:52.060]  I mean, Mexico... Yeah, his cell phone cut out.
[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:53.960]  I totally agree with him.
[02:35:54.701 --> 02:35:59.583]  Per capita, there are more billionaires in Mexico and more produced every year than any other nation in the world.
[02:35:59.963 --> 02:36:06.025]  It's only a population of 95 million people, incredibly rich natural resources, in fact, more than the U.S.
[02:36:06.465 --> 02:36:07.706]  I mean, that place is blessed.
[02:36:07.726 --> 02:36:08.766]  It's just like South Africa.
[02:36:09.106 --> 02:36:13.708]  Totally enslaved, still totally enslaved, more resources than you can imagine.
[02:36:14.648 --> 02:36:16.269]  Just all these massive resources.
[02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:17.770]  Same thing with Mexico.
[02:36:18.271 --> 02:36:25.296]  More resources, on average three times the resources, it depends on what element or what resource you're talking about, than the U.S.
[02:36:25.336 --> 02:36:27.177]  has, and the people are absolute slaves.
[02:36:27.437 --> 02:36:35.183]  You try to protest down there, you get beat up or sent to a camp, and they're all up here wrapping themselves in a Mexican flag, saying this needs to be Mexico.
[02:36:35.283 --> 02:36:36.324]  It's outrageous!
[02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:46.695]  And then the media acts like these illegal aliens out protesting speak for American Hispanics, and they try to intimidate American Hispanics into going along with what they're doing.
[02:36:46.735 --> 02:36:47.616]  Did you get him back on?
[02:36:51.959 --> 02:36:56.861]  I know that particular cell phone cutout sound, something like the power on that cell phone ran out.
[02:36:58.563 --> 02:36:59.463]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[02:36:59.843 --> 02:37:01.804]  It's totally unbelievable to watch.
[02:37:01.825 --> 02:37:05.867]  But again, at every level of our government, at every facet of our government,
[02:37:06.946 --> 02:37:07.366]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:30.539 --> 02:37:32.300]  First of all, I'd like to say it's an honor to speak to you.
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:35.361]  I'm very happy that you're doing all the hard work you're doing.
[02:37:35.381 --> 02:37:36.882]  I'd like to personally thank you for it.
[02:37:37.042 --> 02:37:37.382]  Thank you.
[02:37:38.202 --> 02:37:44.124]  And I kind of missed your first guest there, but I wanted to talk about an experience I had with my mother in a hospice.
[02:37:44.464 --> 02:37:44.724]  Yes.
[02:37:45.685 --> 02:37:46.485]  My mom was sick.
[02:37:46.525 --> 02:37:47.746]  She was laid up in the hospital.
[02:37:48.286 --> 02:37:53.328]  I'll try to keep this story short, but basically I got a phone call one day from her doctor.
[02:37:53.348 --> 02:37:53.868]  I never met him.
[02:37:54.308 --> 02:37:56.209]  And he says, oh, your mom's sick.
[02:37:56.229 --> 02:37:58.890]  She's dying and she needs to go someplace else.
[02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:59.510]  She can't stay here.
[02:38:00.561 --> 02:38:03.786]  And I was kind of flabbergasted at the way he put it, but he just put it so bluntly to me.
[02:38:03.966 --> 02:38:08.693]  He suggested either a nursing home or a hospice, and I said, well, what do you recommend?
[02:38:08.713 --> 02:38:10.436]  He said, well, I'd like to put her in a hospice.
[02:38:10.976 --> 02:38:12.358]  So I was all shocked about it.
[02:38:12.419 --> 02:38:13.981]  I said, okay, sure, yeah, I'll write it down.
[02:38:15.339 --> 02:38:19.701]  And so I went down to the hospital, and before going down, I checked out what a hospice was all about.
[02:38:20.121 --> 02:38:22.042]  And when I got there, I had second thoughts.
[02:38:22.502 --> 02:38:25.484]  So by the time I got there, the hospice worker was already there.
[02:38:25.504 --> 02:38:28.165]  I said, no, no, I'd prefer to put her in a nursing home.
[02:38:28.185 --> 02:38:28.585]  You know what?
[02:38:28.625 --> 02:38:29.465]  I don't want to be rude.
[02:38:30.026 --> 02:38:31.546]  I didn't know if we were going to get our guest back.
[02:38:31.586 --> 02:38:33.007]  He's only with us for a few more minutes.
[02:38:33.367 --> 02:38:35.748]  Mike, I want to give you plenty of time to tell this story.
[02:38:36.088 --> 02:38:41.791]  So let me go back to the colonel, and as soon as I'm done speaking to him, we'll go right back to you, okay?
[02:38:42.990 --> 02:38:43.730]  Is that okay, Mike?
[02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:44.351]  Yes, that's fine.
[02:38:44.611 --> 02:38:44.831]  Great.
[02:38:44.851 --> 02:38:52.293]  Let's go back to Colonel Al Rodriguez, retired, and they've started the organization, You Don't Speak For Me, Hispanic Coalition.
[02:38:52.313 --> 02:38:54.634]  They just were on C-SPAN about an hour ago.
[02:38:54.654 --> 02:38:56.195]  He's been gracious enough to spend time with us.
[02:38:56.855 --> 02:39:02.237]  Finishing up, Colonel, your phone cut out there, and I appreciate you coming back with us.
[02:39:03.237 --> 02:39:05.978]  I have a lot of Hispanic friends, I mean, good friends of mine.
[02:39:06.653 --> 02:39:14.219]  And they've told me that they'll be in a restaurant or, in one case, at Circuit City, and that these illegal alien types will march up to them.
[02:39:14.239 --> 02:39:17.522]  And my friend Tommy told me this has happened to him on more than one occasion.
[02:39:18.202 --> 02:39:21.525]  And they'll walk up and say, Hey, you're speaking English.
[02:39:21.565 --> 02:39:22.966]  You're supposed to only speak Spanish.
[02:39:23.006 --> 02:39:23.546]  What are you doing?
[02:39:23.586 --> 02:39:24.347]  This is Mexico.
[02:39:24.567 --> 02:39:25.388]  We're taking over.
[02:39:25.648 --> 02:39:27.269]  You better join with us, traitor.
[02:39:28.470 --> 02:39:32.033]  Have you heard of this going on where Hispanic Americans are being bullied?
[02:39:32.862 --> 02:39:33.442]  Absolutely.
[02:39:33.482 --> 02:39:53.395]  They just had, as a matter of fact, a couple of Mexican TV stations were here, and one of the individuals was trying to force one of our members to speak in Spanish, and he refused.
[02:39:54.402 --> 02:39:56.082]  And he got all upset about it.
[02:39:58.223 --> 02:40:00.603]  Our member told him, hey, this is America.
[02:40:00.643 --> 02:40:07.024]  We're conducting an American media event, and I will not speak Spanish for you.
[02:40:07.965 --> 02:40:10.805]  He knew that he was an American Hispanic.
[02:40:11.645 --> 02:40:20.947]  These people, they're attempting to run this country, attempting to get their legal status any way they can get it.
[02:40:21.627 --> 02:40:32.172]  And the culprit behind all this is, of course, the country that's getting over $13 billion from all the taxpayers in the U.S.
[02:40:33.032 --> 02:40:36.334]  hiring these illegal aliens and that money going back to Mexico.
[02:40:37.094 --> 02:40:44.538]  It costs you, the taxpayer, me, the taxpayer, over $61 billion here in the States.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:48.581]  To sustain hospitals, schools, etc.
[02:40:48.722 --> 02:40:49.582]  for the illegals.
[02:40:49.962 --> 02:40:55.124]  Well, also, it's over $35 billion a year that these illegal aliens send back to Mexico.
[02:40:55.144 --> 02:41:06.769]  Well, that figure, like the figure of how many illegals is here in the state, varies up and down, because there's no way that you and I, nor the U.S.
[02:41:06.789 --> 02:41:10.911]  government, can keep a track record of how many there is here.
[02:41:11.311 --> 02:41:13.272]  The figure that's being used right now is 11 to 12 million.
[02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:17.587]  But that's, to me, that's very low.
[02:41:18.186 --> 02:41:23.367]  I tend to believe that there's over 20 and pretty close to 30 million illegals here.
[02:41:24.868 --> 02:41:25.908]  Not paying taxes.
[02:41:26.148 --> 02:41:27.949]  Well, so let me bring up another point to you.
[02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:45.133]  A lot of people, whether they're black, white, or English-speaking Hispanics, are basically told now in some meatpacking plants or in restaurants, in the kitchen, hey, man, you don't speak Spanish, you're not wanted here, and these illegal aliens won't even work with somebody if they're not from Mexico.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:46.360]  Hey, listen.
[02:41:46.721 --> 02:41:48.782]  That's happening in communities.
[02:41:49.222 --> 02:41:50.443]  That's happening in schools.
[02:41:50.883 --> 02:41:54.185]  That's happening in many job areas.
[02:41:54.826 --> 02:41:59.609]  In California, in some instances, they're taking over the entire workforce.
[02:42:00.529 --> 02:42:01.230]  Believe you me.
[02:42:02.054 --> 02:42:04.876]  Yeah, it's not just, quote, jobs Americans don't want.
[02:42:04.896 --> 02:42:06.597]  This is a takeover.
[02:42:06.737 --> 02:42:15.964]  And if you want to talk about racism or nationalism, they're totally nationalistic, but then we're not supposed to be nationalistic about America.
[02:42:16.444 --> 02:42:23.990]  Oh, no, and I'll tell you, hey, we have immigrant laws in Mexico to protect Mexico.
[02:42:24.310 --> 02:42:29.974]  But, see, we can't protect the South because, and that's only because we have a very, very weak country.
[02:42:31.944 --> 02:42:34.285]  Well, sir, I only have two final questions for you.
[02:42:34.765 --> 02:42:36.505]  There's a call for violent revolution.
[02:42:36.565 --> 02:42:37.765]  You say it needs to be down there.
[02:42:37.845 --> 02:42:38.565]  I agree with you.
[02:42:39.165 --> 02:42:43.286]  But there's a lot of talk about massive riots in every major American city.
[02:42:43.806 --> 02:42:45.606]  The police won't be able to deal with it.
[02:42:45.686 --> 02:42:47.707]  We could see American cities burn.
[02:42:48.147 --> 02:42:49.907]  A lot of analysts are saying that.
[02:42:50.447 --> 02:42:51.607]  Do you see that happening?
[02:42:52.408 --> 02:42:53.168]  Well, let me tell you.
[02:42:53.268 --> 02:42:58.229]  I think you may be a little bit young to remember this.
[02:42:59.129 --> 02:42:59.929]  During World War II,
[02:43:01.343 --> 02:43:02.803]  Do you remember the Sioux Tutors?
[02:43:03.904 --> 02:43:04.264]  Yes.
[02:43:04.804 --> 02:43:12.006]  You recall the Sioux Tutors, how they were attacking mostly servicemen in the West Coast?
[02:43:12.846 --> 02:43:26.709]  Tell you what, when the armed forces got together, the Sioux Tutors disappeared immediately within a couple of weeks after they attempted, of course, to continue hurting the armed service members.
[02:43:27.525 --> 02:43:31.266]  In the lower Southern California area.
[02:43:31.786 --> 02:43:34.426]  And that was the end of the suit shooter era.
[02:43:34.687 --> 02:43:36.847]  Why were the good shooters attacking the troops?
[02:43:37.367 --> 02:43:47.649]  Well, they were, again, you don't know this, probably, but they were illegal in California going that far back.
[02:43:48.549 --> 02:43:56.911]  And that, consequently, I hate to see that come around because if anything like that happens now, there's a bunch of veterans
[02:44:03.176 --> 02:44:04.056]  Well, it's amazing.
[02:44:04.116 --> 02:44:05.316]  History just continues.
[02:44:05.857 --> 02:44:08.217]  I go back to, why don't they just want to be Americans?
[02:44:08.297 --> 02:44:12.498]  Why do they love corrupt Mexico, one of the most corrupt countries on the planet?
[02:44:12.879 --> 02:44:14.039]  Why do they love it so much?
[02:44:14.059 --> 02:44:15.739]  You know what?
[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:17.360]  I tell them,
[02:44:18.052 --> 02:44:20.214]  The greatest enemy is not us.
[02:44:20.694 --> 02:44:22.095]  It's not us that dislikes them.
[02:44:22.455 --> 02:44:27.478]  It's their country, Mexico and the Mexican government, and the corrupt Mexican government.
[02:44:27.919 --> 02:44:33.903]  I've got to go, Guy, very much for your time, and hopefully your audience got something out of this.
[02:44:33.943 --> 02:44:35.144]  No, we certainly did.
[02:44:35.464 --> 02:44:39.006]  Is there a website for your group you'd like to give out, or have you not started one yet?
[02:44:39.206 --> 02:44:42.989]  I do not have it presently, but we do have one, and I'll make sure you get one.
[02:44:43.509 --> 02:44:44.950]  Okay, thank you so much, sir.
[02:44:45.511 --> 02:44:46.171]  Thank you, sir.
[02:44:46.391 --> 02:44:46.752]  Take care.
[02:44:46.792 --> 02:44:47.172]  Bye-bye.
[02:44:48.507 --> 02:44:49.747]  Well, there you have it.
[02:44:50.148 --> 02:44:55.710]  And I read about the Zoot Suits, and I knew that they were kind of a racist, racial gang.
[02:44:56.430 --> 02:44:58.631]  And now you've got the Brown Berets and all the rest of it.
[02:44:58.651 --> 02:45:04.252]  We had some liberal listener who admits he's a socialist last hour go, Alex, I'm really concerned.
[02:45:04.292 --> 02:45:06.833]  You're buying Bush's propaganda against the illegals.
[02:45:07.334 --> 02:45:09.074]  Bush is running all of this.
[02:45:09.114 --> 02:45:11.955]  The globalists want to get rid of our sovereignty.
[02:45:12.555 --> 02:45:14.096]  We can all live in peace together.
[02:45:14.136 --> 02:45:17.217]  That's not going to happen with all these illegal aliens.
[02:45:18.513 --> 02:45:19.173]  And you heard him.
[02:45:19.233 --> 02:45:22.694]  I mean, the media is not going to be able to spin when they're beating people's heads in.
[02:45:23.355 --> 02:45:24.275]  And that's already started.
[02:45:24.815 --> 02:45:27.816]  You're not going to be able to suppress it, and the government just loves it.
[02:45:28.116 --> 02:45:29.817]  They love the big fight that's going to ensue.
[02:45:29.857 --> 02:45:30.497]  It's so sick.
[02:45:31.417 --> 02:45:34.278]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:45:34.338 --> 02:45:38.279]  Mike in Pennsylvania, he was talking about how the hospital didn't want to treat his mother anymore.
[02:45:38.599 --> 02:45:40.000]  They said, send her to a hospice.
[02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:42.701]  You go to the hospital because you love your mother.
[02:45:42.741 --> 02:45:44.861]  Most kids wouldn't even check it out for their parents.
[02:45:45.241 --> 02:45:45.942]  You get there.
[02:45:46.182 --> 02:45:46.662]  What happens?
[02:45:47.267 --> 02:45:53.211]  Well, before I got there, I made an arrangement that the only way that I would allow her to go there is if they kept intravenous in her.
[02:45:53.331 --> 02:45:55.893]  I mean, she was coherent, she was walking around, she was going to the bathroom.
[02:45:55.933 --> 02:45:59.655]  You know, everything was fine with her, except she wasn't eating because she had a slight stomachache.
[02:45:59.695 --> 02:46:00.556]  That's all I knew.
[02:46:01.516 --> 02:46:03.998]  So they agreed that they would leave the intravenous in her.
[02:46:04.258 --> 02:46:15.165]  Once she did get there, though, of course, no intravenous, and they started pumping her up with morphine, within three days, she went from being a perfect, coherent person to being gone.
[02:46:15.686 --> 02:46:16.026]  She died.
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:18.521]  And totally against my wishes.
[02:46:18.601 --> 02:46:23.884]  I even argued with the hospice worker, why aren't you putting her on intravenous like we agreed?
[02:46:24.585 --> 02:46:27.426]  And it's kind of like what you were talking about before.
[02:46:27.446 --> 02:46:30.088]  They basically just pumped her up with morphine.
[02:46:30.288 --> 02:46:35.631]  Why didn't you, I mean, I'm not attacking you, sir, because you didn't know them, but why didn't you get her out of there?
[02:46:35.651 --> 02:46:36.512]  I tried to argue with them.
[02:46:36.532 --> 02:46:38.393]  They kept telling me this is the best thing to do for them.
[02:46:39.019 --> 02:46:40.500]  Yeah, so bow down to the doctors.
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:43.342]  The number one rule is just do what you think is best.
[02:46:43.362 --> 02:46:44.303]  I learned it the hard way.
[02:46:44.363 --> 02:46:45.203]  No, I'm not knocking you.
[02:46:45.223 --> 02:46:46.084]  You lost your mama.
[02:46:46.144 --> 02:46:47.084]  I understand, sir.
[02:46:47.365 --> 02:46:51.227]  That's why I have people on like Bob Schindler to warn other people.
[02:46:51.247 --> 02:46:54.910]  That's why I want to be on other AM and FM stations.
[02:46:54.970 --> 02:46:56.331]  We're trying to save lives.
[02:46:56.791 --> 02:46:57.932]  And God bless you, my friend.
[02:46:57.972 --> 02:46:59.673]  Thanks for trying to do the right thing and take care.
[02:47:00.874 --> 02:47:02.074]  Let me just say this right now.
[02:47:02.995 --> 02:47:08.619]  We got a couple calls today saying that a station that's carried the show for, I guess, about seven years,
[02:47:10.403 --> 02:47:13.604]  WVTJ in Pensacola is no longer carrying the show.
[02:47:13.684 --> 02:47:15.405]  Now, they might have run something else today.
[02:47:15.445 --> 02:47:16.725]  They might have had technical problems.
[02:47:17.146 --> 02:47:19.186]  They may still be carrying, and I haven't had time to call them.
[02:47:20.567 --> 02:47:23.708]  But every time we lose a station, we've gained a lot more than we've lost.
[02:47:23.848 --> 02:47:26.789]  I have an actual adrenaline rush, a pang of anxiety.
[02:47:26.809 --> 02:47:31.351]  You know when you walk around the corner and your wife jumps out and scares you and you have that adrenaline rush?
[02:47:31.991 --> 02:47:33.991]  Whenever I hear that, I have this adrenaline rush.
[02:47:35.172 --> 02:47:38.173]  And it's not my ego going, oh darn it, I've lost a station.
[02:47:39.803 --> 02:47:44.426]  It's my psyche, my soul going, oh, tens of thousands of people a day.
[02:47:44.486 --> 02:47:47.488]  I was able to warn new people driving down the road listening.
[02:47:48.469 --> 02:47:51.932]  I talked to a county commissioner who was in Pensacola one time and heard me on there and liked it.
[02:47:53.193 --> 02:47:55.474]  Who, of course, could listen to me too in Austin.
[02:47:56.355 --> 02:47:59.497]  Whenever I hear about a station, we've been on especially a station for year after year.
[02:47:59.517 --> 02:48:03.160]  I mean, stations all the time change formats or they sell.
[02:48:03.861 --> 02:48:04.501]  That's fine.
[02:48:05.562 --> 02:48:07.243]  And the show's really grown in the last year.
[02:48:07.263 --> 02:48:08.284]  We've got a lot of new affiliates.
[02:48:09.113 --> 02:48:12.454]  But to lose affiliates is so upsetting.
[02:48:13.995 --> 02:48:14.655]  Please call.
[02:48:14.675 --> 02:48:20.437]  If you're listening on shortwave, the internet, or satellite, call local AM and FM stations and tell them, pick Alex Jones up.
[02:48:21.178 --> 02:48:22.438]  We're on the ABC Star Guide.
[02:48:23.138 --> 02:48:25.999]  And we've got the big official quality satellite.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.001]  Because I literally have a hunger to warn people.
[02:48:31.101 --> 02:48:34.763]  Just so I can get on air and say, hey, they'll kill your parents at some of these hospices.
[02:48:36.083 --> 02:48:37.724]  Hey, this is going on.
[02:48:37.784 --> 02:48:38.044]  Hey,
[02:48:39.093 --> 02:48:40.374]  Aspartame's bad for you.
[02:48:40.414 --> 02:48:42.516]  Hey, GMO food's bad.
[02:48:42.536 --> 02:48:44.397]  You know, cell phones are bad.
[02:48:45.959 --> 02:48:52.784]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.804 --> 02:48:54.485]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.666 --> 02:48:56.887]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.028 --> 02:48:59.109]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.389 --> 02:49:04.333]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.654 --> 02:49:08.697]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.917 --> 02:49:10.698]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.778 --> 02:49:21.424]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.585 --> 02:49:23.486]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.666 --> 02:49:27.548]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[02:52:00.501 --> 02:52:08.710]  When Bush and the Democrats are trying to pass anti-gun legislation, I want to force conservative listeners to hear the truth and defend this country.
[02:52:09.311 --> 02:52:16.659]  I want to be able to get on the air and go, hey, look, it's admitted, but nobody's paying attention to the fact that the Mexican government hired a U.S.
[02:52:16.699 --> 02:52:20.383]  PR firm that Bush uses to stage all these demonstrations.
[02:52:21.255 --> 02:52:25.819]  I want to be able to get on the air and expose what the Bilderberg Group is up to.
[02:52:25.879 --> 02:52:30.742]  I mean, we talk about real issues Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 and back from 9 to midnight.
[02:52:31.203 --> 02:52:32.003]  And I am excited.

[02:52:32.604 --> 02:52:33.064]  I'm honored.
[02:52:33.104 --> 02:52:37.147]  I'm humbled by the fact that we have millions of listeners, that the show has grown so much.
[02:52:38.428 --> 02:52:39.649]  But we need new affiliates.
[02:52:40.290 --> 02:52:44.513]  So if you don't have an AM or FM station in your area, call the local stations.
[02:52:44.553 --> 02:52:45.474]  Call the mom and pops.
[02:52:45.514 --> 02:52:46.354]  Call the independents.
[02:52:46.374 --> 02:52:47.335]  Tell them to pick up the show.
[02:52:47.876 --> 02:52:51.018]  Stations that are picking us up, call them and thank them for picking it up.
[02:52:52.688 --> 02:53:05.059]  And before we take a final call, it is so important to go to Infowars.com, the secure online video and bookstore, and to get my films and other films and books and books on tape and pro-Second Amendment t-shirts that we carry.
[02:53:05.700 --> 02:53:22.477]  There's so many good materials there that will wake you up, fully inform you, that will wake up those in your friends, your family, your surrounding area, and your purchase of martial law or order of death or road to tyranny makes this broadcast possible.
[02:53:22.978 --> 02:53:24.178]  And we need your support.

[02:54:17.108 --> 02:54:17.848]  Johnny, go ahead.
[02:54:18.428 --> 02:54:18.669]  Hi there.
[02:54:18.689 --> 02:54:21.850]  I'd like to make a comment and ask a question.
[02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:31.293]  My first question is, why hasn't the Israeli government brought up the idea of doing to Sharon the same thing that was done to Shaivo?
[02:54:31.773 --> 02:54:34.314]  I mean, he's in a far worse condition than she ever was.
[02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:37.840]  I don't know if they're big on euthanasia in Israel.
[02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:42.721]  I don't really know their policy on that, but they're pretty, quote, liberal so far as the West goes.
[02:54:42.841 --> 02:54:46.242]  I would imagine they have those same eugenic policies of the U.S.
[02:54:47.082 --> 02:54:47.802]  or Europe.
[02:54:47.822 --> 02:54:48.562]  That's a good question.
[02:54:49.122 --> 02:54:50.983]  Yeah, why didn't they kill Ronald Reagan?
[02:54:51.543 --> 02:54:54.403]  Why didn't they... I mean, I'm glad they didn't.
[02:54:54.643 --> 02:54:57.324]  Why didn't they withdraw his food and water?
[02:54:57.724 --> 02:55:00.624]  In the last year of his life, he was basically in a bed.
[02:55:00.644 --> 02:55:04.925]  And my comment is I'd like to...
[02:55:06.022 --> 02:55:10.525]  I commend GCN on getting rid of the French Connection.
[02:55:11.025 --> 02:55:13.787]  I think that was the worst program on GCN.
[02:55:14.547 --> 02:55:22.032]  And I'm glad that GCN now can get rid of the negative publicity that that show brought to the network.
[02:55:22.412 --> 02:55:24.774]  And they can finally have nothing to do with that.
[02:55:24.794 --> 02:55:26.435]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:55:26.635 --> 02:55:28.036]  You know, the funny thing about that is...
[02:55:29.014 --> 02:55:30.655]  I had never even heard the show.
[02:55:31.135 --> 02:55:31.535]  Literally.
[02:55:32.615 --> 02:55:42.759]  And then when the network, because of technical things, just said, you know, we don't want to pick the show up, I, of course, got blamed with it, which just shows the total delusional nature of that.
[02:55:43.419 --> 02:55:44.140]  Again, I don't care.
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:45.400]  It's not about that.
[02:55:46.641 --> 02:55:48.561]  I'm not involved in the programming of the network.
[02:55:48.881 --> 02:55:49.942]  I wish I had time to be.
[02:55:51.142 --> 02:55:53.023]  But I have a life.
[02:55:53.103 --> 02:55:53.903]  I produce films.
[02:55:53.943 --> 02:55:54.884]  I do radio interviews.
[02:55:55.264 --> 02:55:55.944]  I have a family.
[02:55:56.530 --> 02:56:06.557]  I'm involved writing articles or helping write articles every single day, so I spend my time on the issues, not on incredible ego-stroking convulsions.
[02:56:07.998 --> 02:56:09.419]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:09.459 --> 02:56:14.102]  Keep your eyes on the prize, defeating the New World Order, educating the people in your area.
[02:56:14.182 --> 02:56:14.883]  Do it now.
[02:56:14.983 --> 02:56:17.564]  Expose the murdering terrorist that carried out 9-11.
[02:56:18.305 --> 02:56:20.306]  To everybody out there, thank you for your support.
[02:56:20.847 --> 02:56:22.008]  God bless you all.
