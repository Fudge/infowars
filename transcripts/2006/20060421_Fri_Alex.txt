[00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.091]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.752 --> 00:00:07.813]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.634]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:11.096]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:12.778]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:17.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:21.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:31.898]  21st day of April 2006 on this live Friday edition.
[00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:41.926]  Al Garza of the Minutemen Project, one of the leaders of it, will be joining us coming up later to talk about the ongoing reconquista, the destruction of the U.S.
[00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:50.434]  border, and what it means to the American people and what the Minutemen are doing, and his particular brigade, to deal with this ongoing crisis.
[00:00:52.851 --> 00:01:09.851]  I tell you, yesterday, during a Rose Garden ceremony and during a Rose Garden press conference, during a Rose Garden staged event with a bloody, murdering piece of trash, the communist Chinese president, who openly orders troops to mow down peaceful protesters on a monthly basis.
[00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:11.012]  I mean, this guy's a Hitler!
[00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:21.886]  He's up there with Bush, and Bush is talking about the great freedom of China and the freedom in America, and this lady starts speaking up and saying the days of the Communist Party's abuses are numbered.
[00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:23.828]  The media spends that as a threat.
[00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:28.412]  No, it's saying, I say Bush's days politically in the White House are numbered.
[00:01:28.432 --> 00:01:29.392]  He may be impeached.
[00:01:29.613 --> 00:01:33.336]  Oh, Alex said the days of this particular administration could be numbered.
[00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:34.737]  Ron Paul said that.
[00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:35.498]  Oh my gosh.
[00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:37.960]  Let's conjure that into a threat.
[00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:49.322]  And last time I checked, she was still in custody, and they're talking about charging her with a subdivision of terrorism, threatening a foreign leader, intimidating a foreign leader.
[00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:54.823]  Of course, if she did this in China, they'd grab her up, take her to a slave camp, and take her organs.
[00:01:54.863 --> 00:01:57.845]  They love the Falun Gong because they don't take any drugs.
[00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.445]  They are into totally organic food.
[00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:05.467]  It's kind of a Zen Buddhist slash health kick.
[00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:07.508]  A very peaceful group.
[00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:15.214]  And they have a special facility for taking their organs because the doctors say they are in great tip-top shape.
[00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:19.955]  Very healthy organs of premium for you.
[00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:28.957]  It's kind of like you go to the store, and at least my family, we buy the cage-free, organically fed hens, the chicken.
[00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:30.317]  It costs about three times as much.
[00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:36.978]  Well, the elite, they go get the organically fed humans for their organs.
[00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:46.406]  And the big news is, I was stuck in traffic about 35 minutes yesterday, so I listened to local talk radio, I listened to San Antonio talk radio, and they were attacking her.
[00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:49.147]  They were saying she was bad.
[00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:52.348]  And I literally got nauseated.
[00:02:52.368 --> 00:02:53.208]  I was upset.
[00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:55.109]  Certain things hit me more than others.
[00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.270]  I've gotten pretty conditioned to accept a lot of things, be able to deal with them.
[00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.371]  But I literally was upset.
[00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:03.572]  I was just totally freaked out.
[00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:08.457]  I mean, you think that as much as I do this, stuff won't freak me out.
[00:03:08.497 --> 00:03:09.898]  It was freaking me out.
[00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:15.682]  And then I switched channels and they were attacking her and saying how good China is.
[00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.263]  See, turning in your guns is conservative.
[00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:20.825]  Having open borders is conservative.
[00:03:20.865 --> 00:03:23.306]  The communist Chinese murderers are conservative.
[00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:25.448]  Total tyranny is conservative.
[00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:27.129]  No free speech is conservative.
[00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.810]  Giant government is conservative.
[00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:33.773]  And freedom and the founding fathers and mom and apple pie are evil.
[00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:35.673]  They are communists.
[00:03:35.813 --> 00:03:37.233]  Communism isn't communism.
[00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:38.014]  It's conservative.
[00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:41.114]  And then conservatism is communism.
[00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:42.694]  So I'm bad.
[00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:43.375]  I'm evil.
[00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:44.015]  I admit it.
[00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:45.095]  Yes, you're right.
[00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:46.415]  We should all go to FEMA camps.
[00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:47.635]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:48.635]  She's been arrested.
[00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:53.236]  She should be charged as inciting and threatening and as an evil terrorist.
[00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:55.697]  And just hail world government.
[00:03:55.797 --> 00:03:56.577]  Hail Bush.
[00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:58.037]  And hail everything.
[00:03:59.417 --> 00:03:59.937]  I'm wrong.
[00:04:00.098 --> 00:04:00.638]  I'm bad.
[00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:01.658]  Freedom's bad.
[00:04:01.818 --> 00:04:02.578]  I apologize.
[00:04:03.982 --> 00:04:11.344]  The sickening worship of George Bush just makes me want to throw up.
[00:04:13.104 --> 00:04:13.824]  So we get back.
[00:04:13.844 --> 00:04:15.845]  I don't think I can say it better than Paul Watson has.
[00:04:15.925 --> 00:04:18.085]  It's an article by Alex Jones and Paul Watson here.
[00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:22.686]  Pro-torture, pro-tyranny media rebukes brave Falun Gong protesters.
[00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:24.046]  I'm going to read the whole six-page article.
[00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:31.948]  Because it covers most of the important points, and I'll read a few other blurbs from other news articles and blogs about it.
[00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:34.282]  And then we'll talk about America.
[00:04:35.403 --> 00:04:36.985]  This is out of the mainstream news.
[00:04:37.225 --> 00:04:39.427]  Tribune in Albuquerque.
[00:04:40.628 --> 00:04:48.756]  A Veterans Affairs nurse with a sterling record wrote a letter to the editor saying that she was angry about the criminal negligence in Katrina.
[00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:53.019]  And they called her in and they said, we're going to charge you with sedition.
[00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:58.865]  You're going to go to prison for your letter to the editor.
[00:05:02.242 --> 00:05:05.084]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:06.044]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.144 --> 00:05:06.925]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:11.928]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.288 --> 00:05:19.012]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.313]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:24.374]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.474 --> 00:05:29.136]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.336 --> 00:05:33.717]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:33.978 --> 00:05:41.200]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.881]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:45.762]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:02.967]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.327 --> 00:06:09.072]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:09.332 --> 00:06:14.457]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.817 --> 00:06:24.086]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:29.388]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:33.710]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.652]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:39.052 --> 00:06:44.914]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:06:55.505 --> 00:06:56.606]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:02.244]  We're good to go.
[00:07:24.156 --> 00:07:25.216]  We're good to go.
[00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:47.182]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:47.202 --> 00:07:48.963]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:49.023 --> 00:07:50.164]  All right, 8 minutes, 15 seconds in.
[00:07:50.184 --> 00:07:51.405]  It is Friday, the 21st day of April 2006.
[00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:51.885]  Al Garza...
[00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:19.874]  One of the head leaders of one of the big men-men group will be joining us from Arizona.
[00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:21.415]  They're the folks that are challenging Bush.
[00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:25.017]  Build a border fence or the citizens of America will.
[00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:28.418]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:31.340]  We'll have open phones today as well at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.701]  Let me get into what happened yesterday.
[00:08:36.408 --> 00:08:39.169]  In the Rose Garden outside the White House first.
[00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.432]  And let me just start with the fact that we covered it when the show began.
[00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:44.532]  We played clips.
[00:08:44.692 --> 00:08:48.314]  We discussed what was really happening and going on in China.
[00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:58.019]  We played audio from the video of them machine gunning crowds of incredibly brave farmers who were having their tiny plots of land taken and literally just put on the streets.
[00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:03.762]  The farmers are fighting back with hoes and pitchforks and shovels and being machine gunned.
[00:09:05.006 --> 00:09:08.368]  They're having cinnamon squares on average every month in China right now.
[00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:10.050]  China is being more abusive.
[00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.712]  They're openly putting ads in medical journals selling organs.
[00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:18.235]  The British Medical Journal, the American medical journals are criticizing it.
[00:09:18.415 --> 00:09:19.216]  It's admitted.
[00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:29.043]  And then the mainstream media spins it and says the Falun Gong claims they're taken to a secret camp, and then they list the camp, and have their organs harvested.
[00:09:29.623 --> 00:09:31.405]  No, there's no claiming about it.
[00:09:31.786 --> 00:09:38.534]  It's as documented as the rising and setting of the sun each day as the world turns.
[00:09:39.688 --> 00:09:47.071]  But the big news is that I listen to local talk radio, I listen to a local show out of San Antonio as well in traffic yesterday.
[00:09:47.111 --> 00:10:03.477]  I had a sick feeling when I tuned into the local station and the host was defending it and defending her arrest and saying China's our buddy and we're in bed with China and we've got to do this and we've got to show them we're tough and you don't have a right to do this and she threatened the Chinese president, which she didn't.
[00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:05.496]  They only took half of her quote.
[00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:13.965]  She was saying that the Communist Chinese government's abuse of the Falun Gong and their party's days are numbered, and then that's been spun into your days are numbered.
[00:10:15.807 --> 00:10:19.570]  That'd be like Ron Paul on the show saying he thinks George Bush's days in office are numbered.
[00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.054]  He'll probably be impeached, and then they just say, Ron Paul, Bush's days are numbered.
[00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:27.258]  See, that's how they spin this in this new Soviet-slash-Nazi America.
[00:10:28.368 --> 00:10:29.829]  But I had a sinking feeling.
[00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:31.190]  I said, this is a big story.
[00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.932]  I'm going to change the channel, and it's going to be on the next talk show.
[00:10:35.692 --> 00:10:40.995]  And I hit the button, and it went to the San Antonio station, and it was as if they were following a script.
[00:10:41.676 --> 00:10:45.718]  And I got really, not even mad, I got upset, I got frustrated.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:11:00.751]  It showed me how far America has fallen, how mind-controlled we are, and how there is just a group of sociopaths that worship at the altar of unbridled government power and think they're part of the system, and they'll go along with anything.
[00:11:02.032 --> 00:11:06.096]  They're going to go along with the government taking the pension funds, which is already happening, and private corporations doing it.
[00:11:06.356 --> 00:11:07.977]  They're going to go along with national ID cards.
[00:11:07.997 --> 00:11:09.478]  They're going to go along with forced drugging.
[00:11:09.718 --> 00:11:15.443]  They're going to go along with just all the cornucopia of bad things that are happening.
[00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:21.526]  That's all they know how to do is worship and lick boots because they're cowardly scum.
[00:11:22.506 --> 00:11:27.370]  And I watched as the media, as cameramen, tried to grab her and cover her mouth.
[00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.212]  And then the Secret Service dragging her out, covering her mouth.
[00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:32.553]  Oh, don't let her talk.
[00:11:32.653 --> 00:11:34.395]  Oh, the evil speech.
[00:11:34.595 --> 00:11:35.816]  Oh, no.
[00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.638]  And then CNN cut the video feed.
[00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:40.639]  Communist China didn't have to do it.
[00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:44.507]  CNN cut their feed.
[00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:50.512]  CNN, during the international transmission, CNN International, they don't need to be told by the Chai Coms.
[00:11:50.552 --> 00:11:50.912]  They know.
[00:11:50.952 --> 00:11:51.573]  They understand.
[00:11:51.793 --> 00:11:52.453]  They're controlled.
[00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:55.276]  They cut the feed instantly when she started talking.
[00:11:56.096 --> 00:11:57.117]  They went to black.
[00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:00.400]  And, of course, Communist China did as well.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.023]  And Google and Yahoo and all of them are busy censoring for China.
[00:12:04.443 --> 00:12:07.746]  Bill Gates is saying we need to censor and control and tax the web.
[00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:09.928]  It's all happening.
[00:12:10.768 --> 00:12:11.669]  It's all happening.
[00:12:12.751 --> 00:12:16.373]  Let me just read this article that Paul Watson put together, which is my input.
[00:12:16.393 --> 00:12:18.454]  It's by Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:12:19.014 --> 00:12:23.737]  Please go to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and get this article and email it out to everybody.
[00:12:23.797 --> 00:12:25.058]  Post it on every message board.
[00:12:25.518 --> 00:12:33.122]  Make sure that this gets out, because in six pages it lays out almost every important facet of this situation.
[00:12:35.996 --> 00:12:40.545]  Pro-torture, pro-tyranny media rebukes brave Falun Gong protester.
[00:12:40.645 --> 00:12:47.819]  Woman who told mass-murdering dictator Hu, your days are numbered, grabbed and arrested by Secret Service.
[00:12:48.815 --> 00:13:15.102]  The courageous and awe-inspiring actions of Falun Gong member who warned China's imperial festering slug dictator, Hu Jintao, that his days were numbered, you can tell what part of the article I wrote, I can't help it, and Paul doesn't do all the name-calling, were met with a reaction that foretells the collapse of America into the exact same style of tyrannical despotism mastered by the absolute rulers of China.
[00:13:15.802 --> 00:13:17.923]  And so I have the clip later, I forgot to tell the network,
[00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:22.390]  I want to tell my staff, go get the video clip off the web.
[00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:26.932]  Just type in Alex Jones arrested for questioning George Bush is the headline.
[00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:28.493]  And get that video.
[00:13:28.513 --> 00:13:31.414]  And I want to send that audio up to the network so we can play that later.
[00:13:31.774 --> 00:13:34.635]  This happened to me six, seven years ago.
[00:13:35.683 --> 00:13:53.007]  Wang Wenyi, I believe is how you pronounce it, a reporter for the Epoch Times admonished President Bush to stop Hu from persecuting the Falun Gong and after a couple of minutes was grabbed by Secret Service agents who are now trying to charge her with intimidating a foreign official.
[00:13:53.687 --> 00:13:59.729]  And of course, the Chinese dictator started walking off the stage and Bush grabbed him and said, it's okay.
[00:14:00.558 --> 00:14:08.022]  A foreign official who rules over a communist jackboot society in which any dissent is crushed by the iron fist of the state.
[00:14:08.843 --> 00:14:15.086]  After listening to talk radio in the hours after the incident, we were sickened to hear radio hosts and callers attacking.
[00:14:15.326 --> 00:14:17.147]  Oh yeah, I heard the callers attacking too.
[00:14:17.828 --> 00:14:20.349]  Just foaming and frothing caller after caller.
[00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.791]  And of course I called in one of the shows and wasn't allowed on.
[00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:26.922]  No, we're just going to have people attacking her.
[00:14:26.962 --> 00:14:28.102]  Sorry, thank you, Click.
[00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:30.823]  We love destroying America.
[00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:43.426]  After listening to talk radio in the hours after the incident, we were shaken to hear radio hosts and callers attacking the demonstrator for daring to interrupt President Bush, claiming that it sent the wrong message to China that the U.S.
[00:14:43.446 --> 00:14:46.227]  was not able to manage geopolitical events smoothly.
[00:14:47.588 --> 00:14:51.369]  Yeah, the quotes were, we've got to show them we're tough, we've got to show them we're in control.
[00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:52.109]  What does that mean?
[00:14:52.805 --> 00:15:05.953]  They were actually insinuating that it was an American virtue to silence free speech and dissent and that the demonstrator made the country look weak to the visiting Chinese despot who runs much of our port security, I would add.
[00:15:06.534 --> 00:15:07.294]  We're not worried about that.
[00:15:07.314 --> 00:15:08.475]  We're worried about the Arabs doing it.
[00:15:09.335 --> 00:15:11.617]  See, it's all Twilight Zone, how weird things are.
[00:15:12.637 --> 00:15:15.059]  This was echoed by news anchors across the nation.
[00:15:16.497 --> 00:15:17.377]  Watch the video.
[00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:18.358]  We have a link to that.
[00:15:18.998 --> 00:15:21.659]  And notice how CNN presenters express relief.
[00:15:21.859 --> 00:15:22.320]  Oh, good.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.780]  Oh, they finally got her.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:36.186]  In fact, go to the article network and get that little section where it says watch the video and notice how CNN presenters express relief when the Secret Service finally grabs and drags her away.
[00:15:36.826 --> 00:15:43.569]  The Judge Report picked up stories about how not only Chinese TV but also CNN International had tried to censor the protester.
[00:15:44.301 --> 00:15:49.724]  On China TV, as who was speaking, when yells of protest became audible, the screen went black.
[00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:55.486]  When the feed came back, the screen once again went black when the woman again was heard yelling.
[00:15:55.866 --> 00:16:06.752]  During the CNN International post-speech commentary mentioned on the South Lawn Heckler, the screen also went black again when the CNN reporter mentioned her.
[00:16:07.472 --> 00:16:09.573]  The CNN feed returned when the incident ended.
[00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:30.055]  Derek Mitchell, a former Pentagon advisor, told the Associated Press that the spectacle was an embarrassment because China, quote, must know that the Bush administration is good at controlling crowds for themselves, and the fact that they couldn't control this is going to play to their worst fears and suspicions about the United States into mistrust about American intentions toward China.
[00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:33.836]  I don't know, China just threatens to nuke us on a monthly basis, literally.
[00:16:34.392 --> 00:16:39.376]  They have press conferences with their top generals saying, here are the 200 cities targeted by ICBMs.
[00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:44.520]  If you get involved in any of our affairs or any of our strategic interests, we will preemptively strike you.
[00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:46.142]  That's Wall Street Journal, folks.
[00:16:46.502 --> 00:16:47.042]  Times of London.
[00:16:47.062 --> 00:16:47.643]  You think I'm kidding?
[00:16:47.663 --> 00:16:47.983]  Go read it.
[00:16:48.463 --> 00:16:50.705]  Just type in Chinese general threatens the U.S.
[00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:53.147]  You'll get hundreds of articles going back a decade.
[00:16:54.688 --> 00:16:55.629]  It's a monthly announcement.
[00:16:55.709 --> 00:16:56.790]  Oh, but they're our friends.
[00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.912]  Let's let them run the nuclear detectors at our ports.
[00:17:00.808 --> 00:17:03.190]  The only embarrassment Paul continues is Mitchell.
[00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.110]  He is an embarrassment.
[00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.652]  He's the guy saying that it's an embarrassment what happened to who.
[00:17:07.132 --> 00:17:08.133]  He is an embarrassment.
[00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:10.990]  To what it means to be an American.
[00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:18.754]  How dare this bootlicking pond scum piece of trash equate the image of America with crowd control and the wholesale abolition of free speech.
[00:17:19.194 --> 00:17:34.001]  The Bush administration's taste for stage-managed public town hall meetings and free speech zones would sit perfectly with the Chinese dictatorship as the shining examples of how to create the false perception that dissent is only confined to the fringes of society.
[00:17:34.855 --> 00:17:45.721]  If the Bush administration was really devoted to encouraging freedom around the world, then why is it cozying up and making apologies for the most mechanized and tyrannical police state on earth?
[00:17:47.222 --> 00:17:47.562]  U.S.
[00:17:47.702 --> 00:18:01.370]  officials involved in Hu's visit were quoted by Reuters expressing their anger that it took more than two minutes to grab Wenyi and worried about how it would reflect on Hu's team of traveling, bottom-feeding power prostitutes.
[00:18:02.694 --> 00:18:04.655]  By the way, last time I checked, they're still holding her.
[00:18:04.695 --> 00:18:05.496]  They may have released her.
[00:18:06.457 --> 00:18:08.658]  But they haven't, according to my knowledge.
[00:18:08.698 --> 00:18:09.539]  And why would they keep her?
[00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:11.720]  To keep her from getting to the press while it's still a big story.
[00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:15.042]  The reaction from Bush was to be expected.
[00:18:15.082 --> 00:18:27.311]  His apology was not offered to Falun Gong or the millions of others persecuted and tortured for his failure to demand answers from who, but to who himself for the unfortunate embarrassment it caused.
[00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:28.511]  As we...
[00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:39.336]  Are we surprised that President Bush, who has presided over global torture policy and declared himself to be above the law, finds common ground with a sniveling... Turn the page.
[00:18:41.478 --> 00:18:44.860]  Disgusting, pus-filled worm in the shape of who, Gentile?
[00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:55.535]  A recent report by Sky News, in which a journalist secretly filmed interviews with Chinese dissidents and peasants, revealed that the Chinese government had enacted a brutal policy of enforced displacement.
[00:18:55.875 --> 00:19:06.118]  The government and its contractors are seizing people's land and homes and building their own developments on it, owned by filthy generals, I would add, forcing the population to living in poverty and squalor, literally starving to death.
[00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:14.800]  The notification, no legal procedure, no compensation, the bulldozers and the men with machine guns turn up, the inhabitants are dragged out into the streets, and the home is demolished.
[00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:38.193]  In countryside areas, the sadistic PLA swoops in on farmers and forcibly ejects them from their own land while communities showing more backbone than the average American jellyfish fight and claw back with shovels and farm tools in the face of highly trained military death squads armed with the teeth of high-powered assault rifles.
[00:19:38.926 --> 00:19:45.134]  Massacres on the scale of Tiananmen Square routinely take place with barely a whimper of interest with the Western media or governments.
[00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:52.323]  According to Human Rights Watch, the Chinese government is disposing of anyone who speaks out as having political monomania.
[00:19:53.404 --> 00:19:54.466]  We'll continue when we get back.
[00:19:54.906 --> 00:19:57.670]  And our government's teaching, you're mentally ill if you don't like the corruption.
[00:20:01.954 --> 00:20:08.319]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:13.543]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:21.790]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:28.976]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:29.176 --> 00:20:30.378]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:30.538 --> 00:20:33.942]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:34.002 --> 00:20:36.685]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:20:36.886 --> 00:20:43.714]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:20:49.462 --> 00:20:50.424]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:04.288]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.688 --> 00:21:10.175]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.756 --> 00:21:11.257]  That's right.
[00:21:11.557 --> 00:21:13.860]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:21.350]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:29.589]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:34.831]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.493 --> 00:21:40.515]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.316 --> 00:21:45.457]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.817 --> 00:21:46.058]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.078 --> 00:21:48.018]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:48.399]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.699 --> 00:21:48.979]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.428 --> 00:22:10.050]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:21.533]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:22:21.753 --> 00:22:24.374]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:25.374]  We're good to go.

[00:22:49.645 --> 00:22:50.346]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:50.366 --> 00:22:51.066]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:01.738 --> 00:23:05.341]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:23:05.602 --> 00:23:06.462]  Look no further.
[00:23:06.743 --> 00:23:09.325]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:23:09.745 --> 00:23:18.193]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:23:18.413 --> 00:23:18.853]  We're good to go.
[00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:36.370]  We're good to go.
[00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.810]  We're good to go.
[00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.211]  We're good to go.
[00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:20.374]  The Falun Gong didn't back down.
[00:24:20.394 --> 00:24:33.205]  She stood up at the gates of hell in front of the communist dictator whose party in the last 50 years, now what, 56 years, has killed conservatively over 50 million.
[00:24:33.225 --> 00:24:34.126]  They say 60 million.
[00:24:34.146 --> 00:24:34.787]  They publish it.
[00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:36.308]  They're very proud of it.
[00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:41.305]  In fact, the Communist Party in China has published books.
[00:24:41.385 --> 00:24:52.271]  I remember Peter Jennings doing a newscast on it a decade ago, where they admit that they survived when they did the Great Leap Forward, kicking people off their land then, off of cooking humans in large pots.
[00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:59.475]  I mean, you talk about parasitic, and David Rockefeller and the New World Order have written all these editorials, worshipping Mao when he died.
[00:24:59.515 --> 00:25:00.335]  It's so sick.
[00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:04.338]  Notice all these bankers and industrialists just love these dirty commies.
[00:25:06.554 --> 00:25:23.665]  In countryside areas, the sadistic PLA tribes swoop in on farmers and forcibly eject them from their own land while communities showing more backbone than the average American jellyfish fight and claw back with shovels and farm tools in the face of highly trained military death squads armed to the teeth with high-powered assault weapons.
[00:25:25.038 --> 00:25:31.902]  Massacres on the Tiananmen Square level routinely take place with barely a whimper of interest from the Western media or governments.
[00:25:32.363 --> 00:25:40.127]  According to Human Rights Watch, the Communist Chinese government is diagnosing anyone who speaks out as having political monomania.
[00:25:40.187 --> 00:25:44.390]  By the way, the American Psychiatric Association has come out with a bunch of these rulings now, too.
[00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.191]  Turn the page.
[00:26:06.494 --> 00:26:19.842]  Filled with entire families of peaceful Falun Gong practitioners or even mild dissenters, vomit-inducing organ harvesting procedures are performed on live subjects as their remains then cremated to hide the evidence.
[00:26:20.082 --> 00:26:21.603]  I mean, just think about this.
[00:26:24.724 --> 00:26:34.570]  The forte of the Chinese dictatorship has always been iron-fisted totalitarianism spanning back to the days of Mao when people who owned any substantial amount of property were abducted and tortured to death.
[00:26:35.214 --> 00:26:51.105]  Mal's reign of terror claimed the lives of at least 50 million people, and yet today the image of Mal in the West has been made into a cuddly caricature, they sell it at a bunch of toy stores here in Austin, I've seen them, of cultural sophistication with restaurants opening in both the U.S., in Denver, Colorado, and the U.K.
[00:26:51.145 --> 00:26:56.029]  and London, glorifying a stereotype of a mass murder, starvation, and dehumanizer.
[00:26:57.489 --> 00:27:06.151]  Last year, the London Guardian reported that the Chinese cosmetics companies are using skin harvested from the corpses of executed convicts to develop beauty products for sale in Europe.
[00:27:06.311 --> 00:27:07.031]  They advertise it.
[00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:24.135]  Stories of organ harvesting from political prisoners and Falun Gong members are widespread and confirmed by multiple mainstream sources, including this week's esteemed British Transplantation Society, yet the State Department, even contradicting its own reports, suggested that it's an urban myth.
[00:27:24.975 --> 00:27:28.397]  China also still has a policy of public executions for dissidents.
[00:27:28.737 --> 00:27:30.138]  They have sports stadium executions.
[00:27:30.158 --> 00:27:31.378]  We have photos of that.
[00:27:31.818 --> 00:27:41.163]  The country has flirted with mobile execution vans as it shifts away from the communist system's traditional bullet in the head towards a more civilized use of lethal injection.
[00:27:41.934 --> 00:27:46.617]  The issue of forced sterilization and forced abortion have also recently resurfaced in the communist country.
[00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:56.625]  Despite withdrawing some funds from these policies, the Bush administration still bankrolls UNESCO's projects, which have had direct links to forced abortions and sterilizations.
[00:27:57.245 --> 00:28:01.068]  American corporations like Google and Yahoo follow the orders of the Chinese masters.
[00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:13.985]  Aiding the creation of the most entrenched system of censorship ever witnessed and reopening pro-freedom activists and reporting on pro-freedom activists to the authorities who were later arrested and tortured and executed, I would add.
[00:28:15.346 --> 00:28:24.391]  Alex Jones stated plainly that the events we saw unfold yesterday at Bush and whose public address illustrate nothing less than the fact that we are living in a dictatorship.
[00:28:25.547 --> 00:28:34.853]  Worship of unbridled power leads to tyranny, tyranny to slavery, and slavery to unmitigated human degradation, humiliation, and genocide.
[00:28:35.353 --> 00:28:50.342]  To watch any fellow countryman make excuses for the unarguably most evil and longest-lasting despotism the communist Chinese government causes me to realize that America, for all intents and purposes, is gone, says Jones.
[00:28:52.663 --> 00:28:53.644]  Our elite is...
[00:28:54.821 --> 00:28:59.395]  Wedded to the corrupt elite of China, and they are waging war against free humans everywhere.
[00:29:00.009 --> 00:29:17.239]  To see decadent Westerners making excuses for Bush and China is the height of folly, but we must understand that the average American associates themselves with a power structure and doesn't realize that their life, their liberty, their destiny is cheaper than dirt to the infinitely corrupt New World Order.
[00:29:17.699 --> 00:29:24.162]  Our civilization is run and controlled by degenerate, sadistic, psychopathic control freak filth.
[00:29:24.723 --> 00:29:28.765]  Killing is their business, and business is good, and they're killing America.

[00:31:34.934 --> 00:31:43.822]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:47.384]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:02.386]  Come on, Bill.
[00:32:02.606 --> 00:32:04.427]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[00:32:04.627 --> 00:32:07.769]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.670]  What did you do?
[00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.590]  Rob Bill Gates?
[00:32:09.711 --> 00:32:11.692]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:32:11.952 --> 00:32:17.475]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:32:17.776 --> 00:32:24.019]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.581]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:29.743]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[00:32:30.223 --> 00:32:33.685]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:32:33.925 --> 00:32:34.426]  Whoa.
[00:32:34.706 --> 00:32:35.906]  What was that website again?
[00:32:36.007 --> 00:32:39.489]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:40.909]  Now write this down, John.
[00:32:41.049 --> 00:32:45.352]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:32:45.492 --> 00:32:46.072]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:32:46.353 --> 00:32:47.533]  I'm going there right now.
[00:32:47.953 --> 00:32:48.594]  Check, please.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.862]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:32:52.322 --> 00:32:52.902]  Sure, John.
[00:32:53.143 --> 00:32:57.486]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:57.807 --> 00:32:59.488]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:32:59.668 --> 00:33:00.008]  Deal.
[00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:07.495]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.175 --> 00:33:10.477]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:14.978 --> 00:33:20.603]  Ray, Wes, Sean, Jim, many others are coming up here in just about 8 minutes or so, 10 minutes or so.
[00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:30.471]  I'm going to play that clip later where Bush had me grabbed just like they had that lady grab yesterday back in 1998 when he was running for governor again and already announcing he'd probably run for president.
[00:33:31.272 --> 00:33:32.573]  And this was at a press conference.
[00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:43.842]  And we'll also play the clip of them dragging what they call a heckler, what I call a valiant lady, standing up against a mass murderer, the communist dictator.
[00:33:45.706 --> 00:33:46.966]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:33:47.006 --> 00:33:50.808]  My heart goes out to the Falun Gong, the Chinese Christians as well, the farmers.
[00:33:50.848 --> 00:33:51.728]  Incredible bravery.
[00:33:51.748 --> 00:33:53.249]  I wish we had Americans like them.
[00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:57.050]  I don't mind if we get a few 20 million or so of them.
[00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.131]  I don't mind if those people come to America.
[00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.751]  They'll stand with me and defend freedom.
[00:34:02.912 --> 00:34:06.233]  I don't care if they bring in 20 million Chinese if they're like those people.
[00:34:07.699 --> 00:34:15.725]  What I don't want is these 20-something million illegal aliens from Mexico saying this is Mexico and saying they love their corrupt government that's just as bad as China in many respects.
[00:34:16.926 --> 00:34:18.107]  That's another point I want to make.
[00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:22.711]  I wish Americans were like these valiant Chinese.
[00:34:23.612 --> 00:34:24.432]  But let me just say this.
[00:34:25.333 --> 00:34:27.215]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:34:27.255 --> 00:34:31.378]  I mean, real hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants...
[00:34:32.037 --> 00:34:35.319]  Chlorides, glycerins, lanolens, chemicals, toxins, poisons.
[00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.439]  Probably never, right?
[00:34:36.459 --> 00:34:44.263]  Well, the Calvin Pure Soap Company has been around for 59 years and has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:34:44.303 --> 00:34:48.725]  Now, for the very first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[00:34:54.908 --> 00:35:00.190]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap called... Well, we'll give you the number later.
[00:35:00.825 --> 00:35:02.787]  Or go to CalbinPureSoap.com.

[00:35:12.014 --> 00:35:14.416]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never try anything else.
[00:35:14.456 --> 00:35:16.058]  And why do I not want to give the number out right now?
[00:35:16.698 --> 00:35:22.123]  Because every time we give the number out, their phones blow off the walls and I don't want that to happen and distract the...
[00:35:23.277 --> 00:35:37.061]  Wonderful individual who joins us, Marty, whose father, back in 1947, in a year, it will be 60 years, it is all organic, certified under California's strict procedures.
[00:35:37.081 --> 00:35:41.882]  It was organic before organic was cool.
[00:35:43.242 --> 00:35:49.584]  Normally organic is about double on average what the toxic chemicals are at the fancy organic stores here in Austin.
[00:35:50.313 --> 00:35:56.495]  Well, the stuff Marty sells is roughly 80% to 85% off supermarket prices.
[00:35:56.515 --> 00:35:57.355]  And I've done the math.
[00:35:57.795 --> 00:35:59.576]  And it's the best organics you've ever found.
[00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:04.337]  Made of citrus products, oil of coconut, cherry oil.
[00:36:04.357 --> 00:36:09.799]  I mean, it's just the bar soap, the shampoo, the lotions, the dishwashing soap, the laundry detergent.
[00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:10.839]  It's not a detergent.
[00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:11.379]  It's a soap.
[00:36:11.539 --> 00:36:13.660]  It is unbelievable.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.260]  It's what I use in my home.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.101]  It's what my staff uses now that they've tried it.
[00:36:17.961 --> 00:36:19.702]  It is just so fabulous.
[00:36:19.742 --> 00:36:23.563]  And joining us is Marty, whose son now runs the company with him.
[00:36:23.683 --> 00:36:24.704]  Three generations.
[00:36:25.184 --> 00:36:26.244]  Made in America.
[00:36:26.564 --> 00:36:28.085]  Save 85% off.
[00:36:28.425 --> 00:36:30.126]  You're nuts if you don't go to it.
[00:36:30.446 --> 00:36:31.706]  Marty, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:36:32.127 --> 00:36:32.887]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:34.307]  You're an honest American.
[00:36:35.488 --> 00:36:41.950]  It's a pleasure talking to you and being your sponsor and taking care of you and all the people that listen to you.
[00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.632]  Well, you know, Marty, people know I don't take many sponsors because I have to really believe in something.
[00:36:47.634 --> 00:36:51.677]  Well, we're very stubborn, very old-fashioned, and very conservative from the 18th
[00:37:12.552 --> 00:37:40.818]  19th and early 20th century, soap, real pure soap, was the predominant cleaner in the marketplace until detergents were created, which were far, far less cheaper to manufacture in the early 50s, late 40s, and we just stayed with soap, which doesn't hurt, harm, pollute, is earth-friendly, is triple concentrated, and twice as good
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.321]  As whatever you're buying right now.
[00:37:45.823 --> 00:37:47.945]  Sounds like a B-2 bomber's landing.
[00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:48.985]  Uh-oh.
[00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:50.006]  Yeah, we have it here.
[00:37:50.026 --> 00:37:58.452]  Hey, Marty, when you get into how high quality the soap is, for those that don't know, the big chemical giants...
[00:37:59.407 --> 00:38:08.034]  Around the 1920s, began to run PR campaigns and engineer the entire soap market to chemicalize it so they could control it.
[00:38:08.334 --> 00:38:09.415]  And now they've made deals.
[00:38:09.435 --> 00:38:17.641]  They dominate the store shelves to where it's almost impossible, unless you live near a high-quality health food store, to get real soaps.
[00:38:17.781 --> 00:38:18.662]  And then they cost...
[00:38:19.158 --> 00:38:20.918]  Well, first of all, products are triple concentrated.
[00:38:20.938 --> 00:38:22.179]  We make sure that...
[00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:47.294]  We work with very slim margins.
[00:38:47.855 --> 00:38:52.859]  Our main contention is to get poundage, is to get people to buy it in bulk.
[00:38:53.239 --> 00:38:54.760]  We have bulk packages.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:00.084]  We have one-year, three-year, four-year, five-year supplies.
[00:39:00.585 --> 00:39:07.630]  Since we're factory direct, there's no markups, no distributor, no salesman, no commissions.
[00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.031]  No broker fees.
[00:39:09.392 --> 00:39:12.355]  We've eliminated all that so we can sell direct.
[00:39:12.615 --> 00:39:13.656]  Well, think about that.
[00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:14.437]  Think about that.
[00:39:14.457 --> 00:39:23.366]  When you buy toxic detergents or chemical soaps with 100 plus ingredients in them, if you go read what all these ingredients do, all sorts of allergens and toxins.
[00:39:23.926 --> 00:39:24.567]  We're good to go.
[00:39:48.177 --> 00:39:49.817]  Soap dissolves the soil.
[00:39:50.218 --> 00:39:52.118]  It doesn't strip the fabrics.
[00:39:52.698 --> 00:39:55.059]  All the detergents are stronger than dirt.
[00:39:55.339 --> 00:40:03.301]  They advertise it as such, which means it slowly, microscopically strips the fabrics of soil.
[00:40:03.681 --> 00:40:12.623]  By doing so, it microscopically breaks down the fiber of the cotton or silk or wool or nylons, and that goes into a lint trap.
[00:40:12.963 --> 00:40:16.524]  The lint traps every year get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:22.328]  In the 30s, the 40s, the early 50s, there was no such thing as a lint trap.
[00:40:22.728 --> 00:40:29.552]  It was a little tube that picked up buttons or paper clips or buckles.
[00:40:30.072 --> 00:40:31.053]  That was the only thing.
[00:40:31.073 --> 00:40:33.014]  There was no destruction.
[00:40:33.314 --> 00:40:37.756]  You could have visualized the husband getting up in the morning and saying, Honey, where's my shorts?
[00:40:38.257 --> 00:40:39.737]  Look at the lint trap!
[00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:46.461]  There's no longevity of fabrics and clothing anymore with all these strong detergents.
[00:40:47.049 --> 00:40:53.732]  Soap is still being used, real soap, in laundries, in hotels, in motels, in hospitals.
[00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:55.673]  That's because they know it saves them money.
[00:40:55.913 --> 00:40:56.433]  Exactly.
[00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:57.714]  Because it doesn't destroy it.
[00:40:58.034 --> 00:41:07.078]  And, again, you, for years, have had a lot of wealthy people that have ordered it in bulk from you because they know a lot of elites use this because they're not suckers.
[00:41:07.418 --> 00:41:08.719]  Folks, you need to give Marty a call.
[00:41:08.759 --> 00:41:11.560]  Now, you also have, what, a $14 tote bag.
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.201]  Tell them what's in that starter pack.
[00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:15.842]  It's an introduction pack so you can get acquainted with it.
[00:41:16.022 --> 00:41:18.905]  We want the products to speak for themselves.
[00:41:19.265 --> 00:41:20.967]  This is a six-pound package.
[00:41:21.408 --> 00:41:23.870]  It's a nine-inch by 15-inch tote bag.
[00:41:24.451 --> 00:41:30.877]  We call it a one-month supply, but it'll actually last a family of four, anywhere from one to two months.
[00:41:31.378 --> 00:41:33.560]  It's got four bars of our pure soap.
[00:41:33.985 --> 00:41:35.565]  Nothing like it in the country.
[00:41:35.585 --> 00:41:40.887]  16 ounces of our triple concentrated cocoa butter shampoo.
[00:41:41.307 --> 00:41:43.067]  It's amazing the work it does.
[00:41:43.448 --> 00:41:46.468]  It cleans without all its chemicals.
[00:41:46.488 --> 00:41:49.449]  16 ounces of our liquid cream pure soap.
[00:41:49.789 --> 00:41:54.771]  This is for pots and pans, utensils, dishes, windows, floors.
[00:41:55.271 --> 00:41:55.831]  It's safe.
[00:41:55.891 --> 00:41:57.431]  There's no warning label on it.
[00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:00.312]  We've got 18 ounces of our
[00:42:01.095 --> 00:42:08.324]  Triple concentrated granulated laundry soap, real soap, a little tiny measuring scoop for measuring it.
[00:42:08.764 --> 00:42:15.192]  It's got a book of instructions, not only how to use the products, but all the other uses of the products.
[00:42:15.292 --> 00:42:16.373]  Let me just tell a story.
[00:42:16.414 --> 00:42:18.256]  You sent us another year's supply of
[00:42:18.696 --> 00:42:33.670]  Even though I already had a year's supply just a few months before at my home, and so I was giving it to staff, and the Basset Hound, Ryan's dog, Barron, is up here at night sometimes when we're working late, because I've told him to have the dog around.
[00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:34.271]  I like the dog.
[00:42:34.711 --> 00:42:38.535]  But Barron got in and ate part of a bar and didn't even get sick.
[00:42:38.575 --> 00:42:41.138]  Now, we're not saying eat a bar of this, but can you imagine...
[00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:47.665]  Again, pigs won't even eat genetically modified soybeans in many cases because they smell something toxic in it.
[00:42:48.105 --> 00:42:49.827]  And a dog won't normally eat soap.
[00:42:50.588 --> 00:42:59.038]  The soap smells so good with the cherry oil and the coconut oil and all of it that the dog was trying to eat a bar of soap.
[00:43:00.299 --> 00:43:01.401]  It's better than Exlex.
[00:43:03.889 --> 00:43:08.410]  Okay, Marty, I want folks to give you a call, and I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.632]  Folks, you save 85% off supermarket prices.
[00:43:11.692 --> 00:43:12.632]  It's made in America.
[00:43:13.212 --> 00:43:15.553]  Almost a 60-year company.
[00:43:15.613 --> 00:43:17.354]  How could you not call?
[00:43:17.694 --> 00:43:20.775]  They also have a free, great brochure or...
[00:43:21.556 --> 00:43:23.496]  Free catalog.
[00:43:23.997 --> 00:43:24.857]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:24.897 --> 00:43:27.297]  Free catalog.
[00:43:27.317 --> 00:43:27.617]  1-800-340-7091.
[00:43:27.637 --> 00:43:27.917]  1-800-340-7091.
[00:43:28.037 --> 00:43:31.538]  Or calbenpearsop.com.
[00:43:31.558 --> 00:43:34.019]  That's C-A-L-B-E-N-pearsop.com.
[00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:37.239]  We have a banner on infowars.com there on the left-hand side.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.020]  Over to calbenpearsop.com.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.041]  But here's that number if you missed it.
[00:43:43.061 --> 00:43:43.361]  800-340-7091.
[00:43:43.661 --> 00:43:44.921]  We have Marty on once a month.
[00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:45.801]  He's a great sponsor.
[00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:47.142]  Marty, thank you for joining us.
[00:43:47.302 --> 00:43:48.522]  Let me give you my new slogan.
[00:43:49.182 --> 00:43:51.344]  Our business is going down the drain.
[00:43:53.066 --> 00:43:53.826]  God bless you, Marty.
[00:43:53.846 --> 00:43:54.867]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[00:43:54.927 --> 00:43:55.548]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:43:55.888 --> 00:43:56.229]  You bet.
[00:43:56.729 --> 00:43:57.590]  Folks, give him a call.
[00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.552]  Get the free brochure or the free catalog.
[00:43:59.572 --> 00:44:00.633]  It's a great color catalog.
[00:44:00.853 --> 00:44:04.236]  Get the $14 one-month sampler.
[00:44:05.137 --> 00:44:08.620]  We spend 10 minutes a month with him because it's an American company.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.540]  It saves you money.
[00:44:10.121 --> 00:44:11.302]  It's a sponsor of this show.
[00:44:11.402 --> 00:44:12.263]  We love him.
[00:44:13.004 --> 00:44:14.444]  All right, that's it for that.
[00:44:15.384 --> 00:44:16.285]  Thank you for staying with us.
[00:44:16.585 --> 00:44:20.505]  Let's go ahead and take calls concerning the China situation.
[00:44:20.545 --> 00:44:22.426]  We've got some clips coming up of that.
[00:44:23.106 --> 00:44:25.306]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Delaware.
[00:44:25.386 --> 00:44:26.186]  Ray, you're on the air.
[00:44:27.487 --> 00:44:28.407]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:44:28.627 --> 00:44:29.007]  Good, sir.
[00:44:29.687 --> 00:44:40.269]  Listen, I called you about six months ago, and if you remember, I told you that the Wall Street Journal has all the good information on these creeps.
[00:44:41.147 --> 00:44:42.748]  And I'm glad to see that you use it.
[00:44:42.828 --> 00:44:44.510]  They can't lie in those pages.
[00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.533]  They can lie on the editorial page, but they have to tell the truth in the body of it.
[00:44:48.853 --> 00:44:54.257]  Now, are you mentioning the point I brought up about the Wall Street Journal admitting that they kill dissidents for their organs?
[00:44:54.318 --> 00:44:54.498]  Yes.
[00:44:54.938 --> 00:44:55.118]  Yes.
[00:44:55.198 --> 00:45:01.103]  See, they have to do that because the people that read that paper need to know that information to make money.
[00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:02.644]  So they can't hide it.
[00:45:02.905 --> 00:45:03.325]  Exactly.
[00:45:03.345 --> 00:45:09.548]  You have different brands of propaganda, and it's more elite propaganda, so there is more truth in the journal.
[00:45:09.568 --> 00:45:10.668]  They'll just put a spin on it.
[00:45:10.928 --> 00:45:11.109]  Right.
[00:45:11.169 --> 00:45:14.830]  Let me tell you what we're doing here in Delaware to fight back.
[00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:18.432]  This is a plan we're working on now, and I think you're going to love it.
[00:45:18.932 --> 00:45:25.415]  We're going to have a demonstration or a gathering with signs and what have you, but it's going to be on a sarcastic vein.
[00:45:26.116 --> 00:45:30.718]  We're going to call ourselves Middle Class Americans for More Corporate Profits.
[00:45:32.383 --> 00:45:38.346]  We're going to have signs that say our CEO should be better compensated.
[00:45:39.467 --> 00:45:42.589]  You know, quit persecuting Enron.
[00:45:42.969 --> 00:45:48.472]  You can also have signs that let China harvest political dividends.
[00:45:49.071 --> 00:45:50.371]  I'm taking notes, Alex.
[00:45:52.272 --> 00:45:53.092]  I love your ideas.
[00:45:53.132 --> 00:45:55.073]  National ID cards are good.
[00:45:55.093 --> 00:45:57.153]  Bill of Rights is bad.
[00:45:57.193 --> 00:45:57.754]  Get rid of it.
[00:45:58.274 --> 00:45:59.674]  Yeah, that's good.
[00:46:00.274 --> 00:46:01.615]  Bill of Rights is racist.
[00:46:01.635 --> 00:46:02.095]  Get rid of it.
[00:46:02.255 --> 00:46:03.255]  Yeah, that's great.
[00:46:03.575 --> 00:46:05.276]  See, all this stuff to make people think.
[00:46:05.936 --> 00:46:09.977]  Now, I'm a former anti-war protester, so I know how to do it.
[00:46:10.037 --> 00:46:12.158]  Stand out on a busy highway with your signs.
[00:46:12.705 --> 00:46:14.667]  Where the traffic has to slow down for life.
[00:46:14.687 --> 00:46:16.208]  But it may not be authorized now.
[00:46:16.268 --> 00:46:17.510]  We may have to arrest you.
[00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:18.390]  Yeah, I know.
[00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.593]  My first phone call from Guantanamo Bay will be to you, Alex.
[00:46:22.394 --> 00:46:25.737]  The point is, they're trying to chill political speech, but it's not working.
[00:46:26.017 --> 00:46:26.558]  Right, right.
[00:46:26.598 --> 00:46:27.679]  They won't.
[00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:28.740]  It's too inbred in us.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.322]  I really have faith that we'll win in the end here.
[00:46:32.183 --> 00:46:33.384]  Now, China's another story.
[00:46:33.664 --> 00:46:36.527]  Those people are in deep doo-doo because they've never had it before.
[00:46:37.208 --> 00:46:38.751]  Well, they're fighting back pretty hard.
[00:46:38.791 --> 00:46:43.561]  I mean, I say every month I see articles of giant riots, but, I mean, these are families.
[00:46:43.641 --> 00:46:44.923]  Now it's every few weeks.
[00:46:45.124 --> 00:46:49.152]  Yeah, they are showing a lot more courage at this point than the American public is.
[00:46:49.844 --> 00:46:51.946]  But I think the American public will turn around.
[00:46:51.966 --> 00:46:55.468]  Can you imagine fighting armed police with machine guns with shovels?
[00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:56.049]  Oh.
[00:46:56.389 --> 00:46:57.650]  I mean, I put video up of it.
[00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:58.531]  They're charging them.
[00:46:59.091 --> 00:47:03.515]  They're trying to run them off their land, and it's men and women with shovels going up against machine guns and being shot.
[00:47:03.935 --> 00:47:05.156]  Sure.
[00:47:05.276 --> 00:47:06.076]  It's unbelievable.
[00:47:06.397 --> 00:47:07.217]  It's unbelievable.
[00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:10.080]  You know, I follow China religiously.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:15.484]  I read five papers a day, so I always find articles about China in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:15.584 --> 00:47:19.647]  Sometimes, you know, the New York Times will have an article or the Washington Post or
[00:47:20.231 --> 00:47:24.454]  One paper or the other, but there's always something, but it's usually buried in the middle pages.
[00:47:24.474 --> 00:47:29.618]  Well, the reports will leave all the police machine gun crowds and show them how to run security.
[00:47:31.399 --> 00:47:32.139]  Have you seen those?
[00:47:32.219 --> 00:47:35.381]  I've read them on air where they just report like it's good.
[00:47:35.482 --> 00:47:36.642]  Yeah, I know.
[00:47:37.943 --> 00:47:43.067]  I really think that Bush was getting tips from the Chinese on torture and...
[00:47:44.045 --> 00:47:46.787]  Concentration camps and how to control the middle class.
[00:47:46.847 --> 00:47:47.388]  I really do.
[00:47:47.548 --> 00:47:48.048]  Ray, I hear you.
[00:47:48.088 --> 00:47:48.669]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:49.229 --> 00:47:50.710]  Let's talk to Wes in Atlanta.
[00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:51.511]  Wes, you're on the air.
[00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:51.931]  Go ahead.
[00:47:53.452 --> 00:47:53.713]  Hello?
[00:47:53.993 --> 00:47:54.313]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:54.673 --> 00:47:55.454]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:47:55.494 --> 00:47:55.694]  Good.
[00:47:56.635 --> 00:47:59.357]  Man, first let me say I just want to thank you for all you've been doing, man.
[00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:03.861]  You woke up my family and myself about two years ago, and I really appreciate it.
[00:48:03.901 --> 00:48:04.641]  I pray for you daily.
[00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:05.762]  I know you're doing the Lord's work.
[00:48:06.082 --> 00:48:06.443]  Thank you.
[00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:11.707]  I wanted to call in today just for I was watching the show on Natural Geographic the other day.
[00:48:11.787 --> 00:48:13.048]  It was Science for Surveillance.
[00:48:13.763 --> 00:48:16.324]  They're actually re-airing it tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[00:48:16.444 --> 00:48:17.005]  Eastern Time.
[00:48:17.765 --> 00:48:20.686]  And they go into, I felt like I was watching Minority Report.
[00:48:20.866 --> 00:48:27.750]  They had the face scanning software, and they put in somebody's face that they were looking for, and they were hooked up to Google Earth.
[00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:29.050]  They had Google Earth real time.
[00:48:29.671 --> 00:48:31.151]  And it was just a matter of seconds.
[00:48:31.191 --> 00:48:35.634]  They would say, fly to London, fly to New York, and it was linked into the webcams.
[00:48:36.134 --> 00:48:42.457]  And they would scan these guys' faces, and they actually found this guy in a matter of, I mean, thousands and thousands of faces in a matter of seconds.
[00:48:43.365 --> 00:48:47.914]  They also went into the eye scanning, the biometric equipment.
[00:48:48.675 --> 00:48:51.340]  There was the backscatter equipment.
[00:48:54.106 --> 00:48:56.228]  The ones that they're using in the airports.
[00:48:56.268 --> 00:48:59.110]  Yeah, they have systems that scan your brain to decide if you're angry.
[00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:05.315]  Now they make you talk into a telephone system and a computer face scanning you, and then it decides if you're a terrorist.
[00:49:05.355 --> 00:49:10.498]  See, now we've proven that their lie detectors are a quack fraud, so now they have more complex black bots.
[00:49:10.518 --> 00:49:13.140]  Well, it says you're a terrorist, so now you can't fly.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.161]  Insane.
[00:49:14.661 --> 00:49:15.722]  Did the show talk about that?
[00:49:16.703 --> 00:49:17.724]  They didn't get into that.
[00:49:18.184 --> 00:49:19.025]  They did go into...
[00:49:19.847 --> 00:49:28.910]  Like the same type of backscatter where they have an x-ray set up in an unmarked van, and they would go drive through parking lots and scan people's cars to see what they had inside of it.
[00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.991]  Yeah, they also have a deal where they pull up and then make you walk through a high-powered x-ray.
[00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:36.612]  They're going to put those in every airport, then on the streets, and at all shopping malls.
[00:49:36.952 --> 00:49:44.714]  The FBI has announced, everywhere you go, you'll be searched by men with machine guns, but the border will be wide open, and the port security will be run by the Communist Chinese military.
[00:49:44.934 --> 00:49:45.874]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:49:45.974 --> 00:49:46.875]  Yeah, it makes perfect sense.
[00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:52.346]  One more thing I wanted to talk about, actually about the video.
[00:49:52.366 --> 00:49:53.927]  They also go into the Baja Beach Club.
[00:49:53.967 --> 00:49:58.148]  I know you had on... How people are taking microchips to get to hang out with the girls in bikinis.
[00:49:58.308 --> 00:49:58.768]  Exactly.
[00:49:59.328 --> 00:50:01.409]  They got inside of there and they showed a little bit of that.
[00:50:02.129 --> 00:50:12.852]  My question is, how far are we away from the MMEA where they can actually take the neurotransmitters and program them back into the chips, manipulating those neurotransmitters, putting thoughts in people's heads?
[00:50:13.504 --> 00:50:16.085]  They already have that, CBS reported six years ago.
[00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:33.350]  They've had RoboRat for a decade, RoboRoach for 25 years, and now they're coming out with more advanced systems where you can have a cat stop, scratch, use the restroom, die, and they're talking about putting violent prisoners for our safety, of course.
[00:50:34.411 --> 00:50:38.532]  Peter Warwick, or Kevin Warwick, he's also got a new documentary coming out
[00:50:39.331 --> 00:50:40.312]  It's called I, Human.
[00:50:40.832 --> 00:50:43.794]  Yeah, he's the London professor with all the chips in him.
[00:50:44.175 --> 00:50:44.535]  Exactly.
[00:50:44.555 --> 00:50:45.956]  That's going to be coming out sometime this year.
[00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:47.797]  It's going to be on National Geographic as well.
[00:50:49.439 --> 00:50:51.800]  You want high-tech techno slavery, baby?
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.801]  You're going to get it.
[00:50:52.861 --> 00:50:53.602]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:54.482 --> 00:50:56.664]  You want to go into the depths of hell, America?
[00:50:57.464 --> 00:50:59.626]  Giggle and snicker about what happened to that lady.
[00:51:02.228 --> 00:51:05.110]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.501]  We're good to go.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:21.700]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:40.567 --> 00:51:42.649]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:51:42.729 --> 00:51:45.330]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:49.153]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:54.276]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:51:54.376 --> 00:51:56.377]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:51:56.617 --> 00:51:58.138]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:58.299 --> 00:52:00.380]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:01.703 --> 00:52:05.265]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.

[00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:34.291]  I think?
[00:54:07.658 --> 00:54:12.022]  Al Garza, Arizona Minute Man, one of their leaders, joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:12.042 --> 00:54:14.725]  We're going to go back to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:54:16.066 --> 00:54:23.192]  I want to challenge everybody to not wait to go to Infowars.com and the secure online video and bookstore and get Martial Law.
[00:54:23.232 --> 00:54:26.976]  I was thinking in the shower this morning about how good that film is and how I don't promote it enough.
[00:54:27.699 --> 00:54:31.641]  We spend over an hour on 9-11 proving that the globalists carried it out and showing how they did it.
[00:54:32.082 --> 00:54:38.925]  We show the latest police state developments, sound cannons, police threatening to arrest us with congressional press passes anywhere in the city interviewing anyone.
[00:54:39.506 --> 00:54:51.773]  We spend a whole hour on the Nazi connections to the New World Order and the Bushes and the Bohemian Grove and confront David Gergen and then we spend the last 15 minutes on Bushes and second inauguration and all the police state there and
[00:54:52.853 --> 00:54:57.154]  And in the last five minutes on their Global Master Plan, it's three hours long.
[00:54:57.174 --> 00:54:58.215]  A little over three hours.
[00:54:58.335 --> 00:55:00.575]  But three hours, 43 seconds, you want to get exact.
[00:55:01.935 --> 00:55:03.056]  You want to get precise about it.
[00:55:03.196 --> 00:55:03.956]  Martial Law.
[00:55:04.016 --> 00:55:04.656]  Get it today.
[00:55:05.116 --> 00:55:08.357]  Get my new film, The Order of Death, and get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove free.
[00:55:08.757 --> 00:55:13.338]  Infowars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:14.359 --> 00:55:17.099]  But we know China's run by a bunch of murdering criminals.
[00:55:17.799 --> 00:55:19.940]  We know the Chinese people are wonderful people.
[00:55:20.507 --> 00:55:29.670]  We know that the CIA now admits that in 1949 they put Mao in power and didn't want the Nationalists in there.
[00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.331]  That's now declassified public.
[00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:33.712]  We already knew that, but they declassified it six years ago.
[00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:46.256]  But the big story is that talk radio, so-called conservative talk radio, conservatism is now whatever Bush says it is.
[00:55:47.401 --> 00:55:56.284]  Again, we've had one of the NRA board members, former congressman Bob Barron, just a few months ago, saying, without me even prompting him, that Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton.
[00:55:57.344 --> 00:55:59.105]  He tried to get the assault offense ban passed.
[00:55:59.145 --> 00:55:59.605]  He couldn't.
[00:56:00.245 --> 00:56:02.806]  He flogged Congress to try to whip them into shape.
[00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:03.426]  It didn't work.
[00:56:05.306 --> 00:56:09.328]  And now he's using, they built a new federal building in D.C.
[00:56:09.368 --> 00:56:11.168]  It's now a giant new BATF complex.
[00:56:11.208 --> 00:56:13.389]  He's doubled their funding all at the state level.
[00:56:14.278 --> 00:56:17.561]  They are gun-grabbing everywhere, and Bart was saying this.
[00:56:18.081 --> 00:56:23.285]  They're using regulations, not laws, to ban importation and go after gun dealers.
[00:56:23.405 --> 00:56:28.269]  It is a reign of terror against our precious Second Amendment.
[00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:30.410]  And I'm a liberal for saying that.
[00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:39.497]  Again, a few months ago, I was buying the exact type of shotgun Cheney has, or very close to it, not exactly, but the same gauge, same choke, same load.
[00:56:40.718 --> 00:56:43.460]  And I'm there at McBride's, and half the people are huge fans of
[00:56:44.472 --> 00:56:48.213]  And the other half, it's a big gun shop, the other half are making snide comments.
[00:56:48.473 --> 00:56:50.754]  Hey, Alex, quit saying Bush is anti-gun.
[00:56:50.794 --> 00:56:52.195]  He wasn't for the assaultman's ban.
[00:56:52.535 --> 00:56:54.695]  And the manager would go, oh, yeah, he is.
[00:56:55.056 --> 00:56:55.516]  Yeah, he is.
[00:56:55.536 --> 00:57:00.477]  I don't remember the guy's name, but be quiet, Sal.
[00:57:00.497 --> 00:57:01.398]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:02.398]  And then they start an argument.
[00:57:03.258 --> 00:57:05.299]  They're living in la-la land.
[00:57:05.659 --> 00:57:08.500]  Bush wants blanket total amnesty for the illegals.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.801]  Bush wants totally open borders.
[00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:17.051]  Bush signed back on to UNESCO that regulates how we run our country under UN treaties.
[00:57:17.251 --> 00:57:20.732]  He's spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[00:57:22.092 --> 00:57:25.312]  I mean, with Republicans like this, who need Soviet-style Democrats?
[00:57:26.453 --> 00:57:27.353]  I haven't changed.
[00:57:27.453 --> 00:57:29.373]  I'm the same person I was ten years ago.
[00:57:29.693 --> 00:57:30.573]  I love America.
[00:57:30.813 --> 00:57:32.073]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:40.955]  And to hear talk show hosts that I know personally, in some cases on the radio, defending the arrest of this woman...
[00:57:41.852 --> 00:57:46.453]  Defending that they may charge her with some type of terrorism charge of intimidating a foreign official.
[00:57:48.254 --> 00:57:49.934]  To hear them defending China.
[00:57:51.514 --> 00:57:53.415]  I mean, it made my stomach turn.
[00:57:53.435 --> 00:57:55.435]  It really, it didn't even scare me.
[00:57:55.495 --> 00:57:56.235]  It made me sick.
[00:57:56.315 --> 00:57:57.256]  It made me sad.
[00:57:57.276 --> 00:57:59.636]  I couldn't even get angry about it.
[00:57:59.656 --> 00:58:01.877]  I was more of just, what?
[00:58:02.357 --> 00:58:03.797]  I wanted to wake them up.
[00:58:03.877 --> 00:58:07.078]  I wanted to get in a room with these talk show hosts and go, where's your humanity?
[00:58:07.438 --> 00:58:08.978]  Don't you see what's happening?
[00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:11.259]  Don't you see what you've become?
[00:58:13.596 --> 00:58:14.416]  But they don't care.
[00:58:14.436 --> 00:58:24.561]  They have gotten where they are by licking boots, by saying yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, by going along with this stuff, and it makes me sick.
[00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:32.704]  So give me 20 million of those Chinese peasants who will fight men with machine guns, with hoes and rakes and axes.
[00:58:34.625 --> 00:58:35.825]  Give me them.
[00:58:36.866 --> 00:58:39.487]  Don't give me you fat, white, stupid yuppies.
[00:58:41.269 --> 00:58:45.892]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:45.932 --> 00:58:46.392]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.432 --> 00:58:47.373]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.393 --> 00:58:50.535]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:54.237 --> 00:58:55.698]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.758 --> 00:58:56.798]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.946 --> 00:59:10.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:11.129 --> 00:59:15.252]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.373 --> 00:59:36.188]  If I had 20 million Americans of the same mettle and the same will as those Chinese peasants being run off their tiny plots to literally starve to death on the streets of Beijing and other cities, who charge troops with machine guns, who mow them down, they charge them with shovels and hoes,
[00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:37.988]  We're good to go.
[00:59:38.768 --> 00:59:39.529]  We're good to go.
[01:00:04.432 --> 01:00:07.153]  Now, Al Garza is another amazing American.
[01:00:07.173 --> 01:00:09.734]  If we had 20 million like him, we could save this country.
[01:00:10.794 --> 01:00:12.975]  He's the National Director of the Minutemen Project.
[01:00:13.995 --> 01:00:15.816]  And I salute him, and he joins us now.
[01:00:15.896 --> 01:00:17.196]  Mr. Garza, thank you for coming on.
[01:00:17.216 --> 01:00:18.657]  Alex Jones, good morning to you.
[01:00:19.257 --> 01:00:20.897]  You're there in Arizona on the front lines.
[01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:21.878]  You're making big headlines.
[01:00:21.898 --> 01:00:22.958]  You're having huge effects.
[01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:26.919]  Tell the listeners, we're going to break here in a minute, tell them about Al Garza, how you got involved.
[01:00:26.939 --> 01:00:28.900]  Tell us about the man, Al Garza.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.061]  Al Garza was born in Raymondville, Texas.
[01:00:33.012 --> 01:00:36.175]  I lived in far Texas, just close to the border.
[01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:39.017]  Went to school there until I was 12.
[01:00:39.197 --> 01:00:40.498]  I moved to California.
[01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:42.280]  California, graduated.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.302]  1965, went into the Marine Corps.
[01:00:44.322 --> 01:00:46.643]  1966, I was in Vietnam.
[01:00:47.945 --> 01:00:50.066]  69, I was discharged.
[01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:52.328]  73, I became a private investigator.
[01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:56.312]  And recently, it's two years ago, I retired from Southern California as a private investigator.
[01:00:57.012 --> 01:01:01.396]  Two years ago, I joined the force of the organization of the Minutemen Civil Defense Corps.
[01:01:05.051 --> 01:01:11.939]  I think that a bell got rung that can't be unrung when the Little Reconquista is funded by Bush and Fox and the big money in this country.
[01:01:13.596 --> 01:01:22.604]  It certainly did, and I'll tell you what really backfired.
[01:01:23.045 --> 01:01:37.439]  It's the fact that, number one, we know for a fact that who was waving these American flags, especially and in particular, what angered me was the fact that they were raising their Mexican flag, claiming that this is their continent, this is their country, all Europeans belong in Europe.
[01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:38.596]  All gringos.
[01:01:38.776 --> 01:01:39.516]  That includes me.
[01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:42.959]  But they are Europeans.
[01:01:43.039 --> 01:01:46.662]  Hispanics are Spanish and German and Native American.
[01:01:47.022 --> 01:01:47.643]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:51.967]  But they're really claiming Mexico as obviously their country.
[01:01:52.027 --> 01:01:55.309]  And they want nothing less than a Mexican takeover.
[01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:58.592]  And this is directly from Fox and all these troopers out there.
[01:01:58.872 --> 01:02:02.015]  And we're supposed to lay down as Americans and not get angry at that.
[01:02:02.255 --> 01:02:05.978]  Well, we've been doing that nonchalantly for several decades now.
[01:02:06.758 --> 01:02:26.228]  Myself, I've never accepted the fact that these people are so nonchalantly coming in, sneaking in, breaking our laws, illegally entering our land, vandalizing us, committing crimes, running stoplights, running over people, bringing their dope in, smuggling human beings.
[01:02:27.204 --> 01:02:29.065]  Smuggling drugs, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:02:29.085 --> 01:02:30.386]  Breaking the laws once they get here.
[01:02:30.426 --> 01:02:31.426]  False documentation.
[01:02:31.486 --> 01:02:32.347]  I mean, the list goes on.
[01:02:32.427 --> 01:02:33.387]  Fraud, fraud, fraud.
[01:02:33.687 --> 01:02:34.828]  Felony, felony, felony.
[01:02:34.868 --> 01:02:36.329]  And everybody thinks it's a big joke.
[01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:38.790]  Well, you and I know it's not a joke.
[01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:42.071]  You're absolutely right, Mr. Garza.
[01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:46.153]  And I want to recap what you said when we get back and then get into more details.
[01:02:46.693 --> 01:02:54.237]  Just personalizing and how you woke up, how you got involved, what you've seen in the last few years since you got involved, and how the movement...
[01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:59.045]  How the movement has grown and some of the websites and how people can get involved.
[01:02:59.085 --> 01:03:06.328]  Then I want to open the phones up to callers so they can get involved and ask you any pertinent questions or commend you or give you any ideas they have.
[01:03:06.728 --> 01:03:12.190]  But first off, give us some of the websites for people that want to support you and other valiant American patriots, other Paul Revere's.
[01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:19.152]  The best website to go to is directly to our website, MinutemenHQ.com.
[01:03:19.492 --> 01:03:21.353]  That's Minutemen, single word,
[01:03:22.815 --> 01:03:29.220]  We're going to break, Mr. Garza.
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.021]  Modern Paul Revere.
[01:03:32.262 --> 01:03:33.543]  Putting his money where his mouth is.
[01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:36.985]  Putting his body in the most dangerous region in America.
[01:03:37.586 --> 01:03:43.870]  The Texas-New Mexico-Arizona border is an absolute war zone with State Department advisories not to travel into the area.
[01:03:44.631 --> 01:03:45.491]  They're being shot at.
[01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:46.672]  They're being killed.
[01:03:46.712 --> 01:03:47.813]  There's been kidnappings.
[01:03:48.273 --> 01:03:51.095]  And he's right there defending America just as he did in Vietnam.
[01:03:51.315 --> 01:03:51.896]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:55.757 --> 01:03:58.600]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.441]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.782 --> 01:04:05.446]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.806 --> 01:04:10.230]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:14.855]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:15.055 --> 01:04:17.898]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.998 --> 01:04:20.480]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:27.245]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:27.485 --> 01:04:34.711]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:37.393]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:56.266 --> 01:05:00.749]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:05.193]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:05.493 --> 01:05:06.033]  We listened.
[01:05:06.353 --> 01:05:11.317]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:11.597 --> 01:05:12.078]  We listened.
[01:05:12.478 --> 01:05:15.520]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:16.461]  We listened.
[01:05:16.921 --> 01:05:20.983]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:21.363 --> 01:05:21.863]  We listened.
[01:05:22.204 --> 01:05:27.426]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:27.846 --> 01:05:29.207]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:29.567 --> 01:05:36.951]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:40.492]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by
[01:05:46.825 --> 01:05:47.827]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:47.847 --> 01:05:49.471]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:55.327 --> 01:06:02.210]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:06:02.351 --> 01:06:15.277]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:06:15.457 --> 01:06:17.238]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:06:17.398 --> 01:06:17.978]  We're good to go.
[01:06:36.527 --> 01:06:37.649]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[01:06:37.669 --> 01:06:38.069]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[01:06:59.116 --> 01:06:59.756]  Big Brother.
[01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:01.457]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:02.177 --> 01:07:03.297]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:04.778]  You want answers?
[01:07:05.518 --> 01:07:06.398]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.418 --> 01:07:11.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.402]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.863 --> 01:07:26.426]  Al Garza is a Vietnam Marine Corps veteran, an American modern-day Paul Revere,
[01:07:28.752 --> 01:07:31.452]  He's the National Director of the Minutemen Project.
[01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:36.613]  And he joins us today from Arizona.
[01:07:36.633 --> 01:07:38.974]  He was going to be in Texas, but got delayed in the next few weeks.
[01:07:39.094 --> 01:07:43.014]  I hope to have him in studio here in Austin, Texas.
[01:07:43.034 --> 01:07:44.815]  But he joins us over the telephone.
[01:07:44.855 --> 01:07:49.976]  They've made announcements that they're going to build a fence on a section of the border, and they'll build more fences.
[01:07:50.596 --> 01:07:54.276]  If Bush won't do it, we'll get his take on this thousand arrested.
[01:07:54.296 --> 01:07:57.917]  If they arrested a thousand a day for a year,
[01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:02.569]  That would be less than 1% of the illegal aliens in this country.
[01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:04.029]  As it is, it was .00004.
[01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:16.592]  We did the math yesterday, so .00004 were arrested in that ridiculous sting on businesses with all these illegal aliens.
[01:08:17.972 --> 01:08:19.273]  So we'll get his take on that as well.
[01:08:20.233 --> 01:08:23.493]  But again, Mr. Garza, we're honored to have you on with us.
[01:08:23.894 --> 01:08:25.094]  It's an honor to be with you, Alex.
[01:08:25.174 --> 01:08:25.594]  It really is.
[01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:38.396]  For those who just joined us, tell us how you got involved, why you got involved, and then I want to get into the things you've witnessed, what you've seen, some of the attacks you personally have been under.
[01:08:38.416 --> 01:08:51.765]  You know, the Chicano Studies UT professor up at Arlington who openly says, well, two years ago it was an implement plan of San Diego to kill all whites above the age of 16, all white males, 16 and older.
[01:08:51.805 --> 01:08:54.387]  Now he said two weeks ago, kill all the gringos.
[01:08:55.083 --> 01:08:58.905]  And so I want to get your take on that as well, but how did you first wake up to this invasion?
[01:08:59.906 --> 01:09:07.850]  A couple of years ago, in 2004, I retired from Southern California, and I found a place not too far from Tombstone that I really, it really intrigued me.
[01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:15.814]  It's just a small piece of land with a manufactured home, and I came from a real nice home, a 2,600 square foot home with a pool, etc., etc.
[01:09:15.854 --> 01:09:20.676]  I wanted something small, buy a little tractor, be back into the ranching business,
[01:09:21.398 --> 01:09:22.560]  A wave of things.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.265]  And it took me about a week to figure out that I had made a big mistake.
[01:09:26.305 --> 01:09:35.578]  And by that, simply meaning that my fences, which, by the way, I had just completely fenced my property on the southwest corner...
[01:09:37.447 --> 01:09:43.312]  The fence was completely trampled down the day after I put the fence up, and I thought it was one of my neighbors.
[01:09:43.752 --> 01:09:49.797]  I later found out that it was a transient, they call them transients, found out it was in fact illegal aliens that are coming through.
[01:09:50.197 --> 01:10:01.826]  What they do is they pull the fence down, they go behind the bushes, they do their thing, they drop their soiled pants, their soiled underwear, their backpacks, tennis shoes, and just discard them there, and I found a pile of all kinds of stuff there.
[01:10:01.866 --> 01:10:07.030]  And I began to ask questions, and oddly enough, one morning, I was watching the news, and this is with Chris Simcox,
[01:10:07.685 --> 01:10:10.749]  To just introduce his organization.
[01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:14.013]  I called him up and I interviewed him.
[01:10:14.053 --> 01:10:14.674]  He interviewed me.
[01:10:14.694 --> 01:10:15.395]  We liked each other.
[01:10:15.415 --> 01:10:15.916]  We shook hands.
[01:10:15.956 --> 01:10:17.017]  He took me out in the field.
[01:10:17.798 --> 01:10:21.363]  And I figured, well, this is another white boy out to kill Mexicans.
[01:10:21.423 --> 01:10:23.606]  It's really what I thought, to be honest with you, being Hispanic.
[01:10:24.628 --> 01:10:29.152]  Well, I soon found out that this was a complete contrast as to what I thought he was.
[01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:33.315]  I was very suspicious of him, but he took me out in the field and he showed me what was going on.
[01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:36.777]  And again, I saw the classic example of what I've seen in my own property.
[01:10:37.138 --> 01:10:45.884]  Backpacks, soil clothing, underwear, literature, Spanish literature, Arabian literature, Japanese literature that was laying there on the ground.
[01:10:46.485 --> 01:10:50.548]  And you're talking about the deserts that we really enjoy trekking through because we like to hike.
[01:10:50.628 --> 01:10:51.989]  Well, can't do that no more.
[01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:54.051]  So needless to say,
[01:10:55.484 --> 01:11:04.609]  About five minutes after we had arrived at this particular observation post, a line of what I'm assuming, it was approximately 50 people.
[01:11:04.689 --> 01:11:12.393]  Among that 50 people were two elderlies, a man and a husband, and I speculated that they either related or husband and wife.
[01:11:13.233 --> 01:11:19.797]  They were distressed, they were dehydrated, and Mr. Simcox was passionate enough and compassionate enough
[01:11:20.436 --> 01:11:24.238]  To go to the back of his truck and he showed me the gallons of water that he carried with him.
[01:11:24.679 --> 01:11:33.484]  We offered him water, he gave him food, and obviously called the Border Patrol and summoned the EMTs to come in and take care of this couple.
[01:11:34.044 --> 01:11:35.805]  I shook his hand, I enjoyed what I saw.
[01:11:36.446 --> 01:11:37.166]  Where do I sign?
[01:11:37.246 --> 01:11:38.267]  I've been with him ever since.
[01:11:39.027 --> 01:11:41.268]  Our reputation speaks for itself without incident.
[01:11:41.308 --> 01:11:48.933]  For well over two years, and although we've been provoked by many organizations that are anti-American, up to now we're unblemished, completely unblemished.
[01:11:49.554 --> 01:11:51.635]  And we've saved well over 380 lives.
[01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:56.157]  So I don't believe that we're the vigilantes nor the racists that we are portrayed to be.
[01:11:57.838 --> 01:12:04.060]  Well, then 87% of Americans are racist and 67% of Hispanics on average are against the open borders.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.102]  So I guess almost 70% of Hispanics don't like Hispanics then.
[01:12:08.702 --> 01:12:12.344]  Well, you know, it depends on how you were reared, I'm assuming.
[01:12:12.424 --> 01:12:15.545]  I was reared to believe in one flag, and that's the United States flag.
[01:12:15.585 --> 01:12:16.946]  My grandfather was in World War I.
[01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:19.973]  My father was in World War II and I was in Vietnam.
[01:12:20.013 --> 01:12:24.977]  So we go back some time and we are, in fact, the fifth generation in the United States legally.
[01:12:25.697 --> 01:12:27.258]  And only one flag for us.
[01:12:27.318 --> 01:12:34.944]  We don't acknowledge nor do we honor any other flag other than, for example, the POW MIA flag and obviously my Marine Corps flag.
[01:12:34.964 --> 01:12:35.785]  But they both go up.
[01:12:37.206 --> 01:12:43.251]  What was it like for you to see in the first three weeks of the staged demonstrations that Bush and Fox put on?
[01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:46.253]  That's now mainstream news that a PR firm staged all this out of Dallas.
[01:12:47.646 --> 01:12:47.867]  I think?
[01:13:01.598 --> 01:13:01.999]  Knowing.
[01:13:02.059 --> 01:13:04.220]  I mean, Mexico enslaves their people.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.562]  Why would these folks want to wrap themselves in the Mexican flag?
[01:13:07.602 --> 01:13:11.124]  It's like wrapping yourself in a communist Chinese flag.
[01:13:11.144 --> 01:13:11.965]  I mean, that's my opinion.
[01:13:12.285 --> 01:13:13.266]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:13:13.286 --> 01:13:15.647]  Your opinion is honored because that's really what it's all about.
[01:13:16.067 --> 01:13:21.371]  First of all, these people that are coming across, they are, as we call them, the peons.
[01:13:23.712 --> 01:13:25.253]  President Fox wants to get rid of them.
[01:13:25.853 --> 01:13:26.794]  He wants to discard them.
[01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:33.390]  And it behooves him because when they come out here, they're sending back something like $20 to $40 billion tax-free dollars into Mexico.
[01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:34.131]  So it behooves him.
[01:13:34.211 --> 01:13:35.192]  It's good for his economy.
[01:13:35.913 --> 01:13:39.797]  And while they're here, they're not only enjoying the freedoms that they shouldn't be enjoying.
[01:13:40.287 --> 01:13:54.179]  They're also digging into our, and depleting, by the way, our public services examples would be Medicare, you know, the medical end of it, the welfare, preschooling for their children without having to pay taxes, and honoring their own flag.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.101]  I mean, the list goes on.
[01:13:56.241 --> 01:14:00.865]  On top of being criminals, they're also cheaters, they're liars, and I'll call them names to their face.
[01:14:00.965 --> 01:14:01.626]  They're connivers.
[01:14:02.066 --> 01:14:03.728]  They'll do anything to get what they want.
[01:14:04.605 --> 01:14:06.447]  But they will not protest in Mexico.
[01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:10.312]  If they would do that in Mexico, they probably would be a lot better off.
[01:14:10.532 --> 01:14:13.756]  But they choose to come out here in our country and disturb our own freedoms.
[01:14:14.757 --> 01:14:19.861]  Well, I know you're familiar with some of the statements by Chicano Studies professors.
[01:14:19.881 --> 01:14:22.182]  One of them is Polish, isn't even Hispanic.
[01:14:23.403 --> 01:14:26.525]  And then she calls Mexicans the cockroaches.
[01:14:27.346 --> 01:14:29.848]  The Mexican elite is very racist.
[01:14:30.568 --> 01:14:32.089]  They try to, quote, stay European.
[01:14:32.109 --> 01:14:37.393]  They're very racist against their own Hispanic population that's indigenous and European mixed.
[01:14:37.813 --> 01:14:41.796]  I don't understand how these people will put up with being...
[01:14:42.336 --> 01:14:43.137]  We're good to go.
[01:15:03.935 --> 01:15:06.976]  What do you think about them now saying, no, let's just kill all whites?
[01:15:06.996 --> 01:15:11.578]  I mean, it's gone from, go back to Europe, Pilgrim, ten years ago, to, you need to die.
[01:15:11.938 --> 01:15:12.578]  Well, that's true.
[01:15:12.618 --> 01:15:16.820]  As a matter of fact, I spoke to my father, who's about, I think, about 85 years old.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.181]  He's been around some time.
[01:15:18.221 --> 01:15:24.243]  He recognizes cultures, and obviously the Mexican movement, as he's explained to me on several occasions.
[01:15:24.696 --> 01:15:26.597]  But I mean, how does that UT professor get away...
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:51.944]  I mean, can you imagine a black professor or a white professor saying, you know, let's say a white professor saying, kill all blacks?
[01:15:52.004 --> 01:15:54.326]  I mean, he's openly saying this.
[01:15:54.726 --> 01:15:55.427]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:55.867 --> 01:16:02.132]  He says it, and there's another professor from Riverside, I can't quite remember his last name.
[01:16:02.512 --> 01:16:03.192]  We're good to go.
[01:16:23.516 --> 01:16:24.696]  Well, that's what Hitler did.
[01:16:24.736 --> 01:16:27.878]  He used the freedom that Germany had to destroy the freedom.
[01:16:50.755 --> 01:16:51.316]  That's correct.
[01:16:51.717 --> 01:16:58.146]  And we've got similarities with these people that are thinking and teaching the same ideals.
[01:16:58.687 --> 01:17:00.309]  You've got Hispanics teaching it.
[01:17:00.329 --> 01:17:03.354]  You've got even whites that are from other countries, by the way.
[01:17:03.394 --> 01:17:04.215]  Oh, yeah, they're running it.
[01:17:04.696 --> 01:17:05.196]  Absolutely.
[01:17:05.216 --> 01:17:06.879]  And they're all wanting to take over America.
[01:17:08.366 --> 01:17:09.407]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[01:17:09.507 --> 01:17:10.927]  I was taught this in college.
[01:17:11.028 --> 01:17:12.528]  I was sitting there in an art class.
[01:17:12.568 --> 01:17:20.132]  They took us down to UT to the art building, and they had a fellow there with a, quote, Chicano Studies art display.
[01:17:20.512 --> 01:17:29.797]  And I sat there for an hour hearing about how... And really what this is doing is, and I'm only 32 years old, folks, there wasn't hardly any racial tension that I knew of between whites and Hispanics.
[01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:30.678]  Now...
[01:17:31.418 --> 01:17:31.959]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:17:31.999 --> 01:17:32.319]  Absolutely.
[01:17:32.339 --> 01:17:35.581]  In fact, you know, just to tie the knot on that thing, going right back to illegal immigration.
[01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:50.753]  As soon as they walk into your land, they're not laughing at you.
[01:17:50.793 --> 01:17:51.714]  They even laugh at me.
[01:17:52.074 --> 01:18:01.263]  They'll flip you the bird and they'll ask you to make a move because they know exactly where to go because if you do anything out of the ordinary, they will sue you and they will own your ranch.
[01:18:01.663 --> 01:18:02.884]  That's coming right out of their mouths.
[01:18:03.505 --> 01:18:04.466]  Yeah, that's Morris Deeds.
[01:18:04.486 --> 01:18:05.806]  They try to start fights.
[01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:06.427]  Sure.
[01:18:06.827 --> 01:18:08.448]  And it's unbelievable.
[01:18:08.748 --> 01:18:12.750]  Now, they call you all sorts of names, but again, I have a lot of Hispanic friends.
[01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:13.550]  I live here in Austin.
[01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.692]  They all agree with you and I, sir, Mr. Garza.
[01:18:17.272 --> 01:18:23.315]  But it's this, what percentage would you say, just a guesstimation of the illegal aliens, are frothing racist?
[01:18:24.876 --> 01:18:28.838]  I think all of the illegal aliens are racist, to be quite frank with you.
[01:18:30.126 --> 01:18:35.811]  If they move into the United States, it'll take them 20 or 30 years to really figure out that they shouldn't be racist.
[01:18:35.831 --> 01:18:36.872]  But it's going to take them some time.
[01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:41.156]  But as soon as they walk in, the first thing they've got in mind is to take completely over.
[01:18:41.496 --> 01:18:42.677]  That's their agenda.
[01:18:43.138 --> 01:18:43.899]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:49.003]  I have a Hispanic friend who's had the illegals walk up to him and go, You don't speak Spanish.
[01:18:49.023 --> 01:18:50.144]  You need to only use that.
[01:18:50.545 --> 01:18:51.225]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:51.246 --> 01:18:51.566]  Stay with us.
[01:18:56.889 --> 01:18:58.510]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:00.931]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:02.052 --> 01:19:09.937]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:10.177 --> 01:19:12.799]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:12.779 --> 01:19:14.200]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:21.305]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:21.545 --> 01:19:24.527]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:24.887 --> 01:19:25.387]  We're good to go.
[01:19:56.181 --> 01:19:57.242]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.642 --> 01:20:03.127]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:04.188]  That's right.
[01:20:04.508 --> 01:20:06.790]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:07.111 --> 01:20:14.277]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.841 --> 01:20:22.527]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.967 --> 01:20:27.771]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:28.448 --> 01:20:33.470]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:34.251 --> 01:20:38.392]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:38.772 --> 01:20:39.013]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.033 --> 01:20:40.973]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:41.033 --> 01:20:41.334]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.634 --> 01:20:41.914]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.665 --> 01:20:55.345]  Hello, folks.

[01:22:10.688 --> 01:22:12.709]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[01:22:12.969 --> 01:22:18.352]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.

[01:22:57.151 --> 01:23:03.174]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:03.774 --> 01:23:06.756]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.636 --> 01:23:11.998]  Al Garza, National Director of the Minutemen Project, is our guest.
[01:23:12.018 --> 01:23:15.820]  We'll give you websites, phone numbers, ways to get in touch with them, support them.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.262]  And we're going to talk about some of the new things they're doing.
[01:23:20.943 --> 01:23:25.105]  Al, I don't think the average American, even the average American Hispanic...
[01:23:25.994 --> 01:23:29.095]  The last few years has realized how big this La Rica Enquista is.
[01:23:29.115 --> 01:23:32.337]  But before we hit the break, I told the story of my friend Tommy.
[01:23:33.337 --> 01:23:36.198]  And he said, yeah, a couple of years ago, I didn't know what you were talking about.
[01:23:36.258 --> 01:23:41.860]  He goes, you know, because he's an American Hispanic, loves America, his dad, you know, the Coast Guard, the whole nine yards.
[01:23:43.941 --> 01:23:48.243]  And he says that now these illegal aliens walk up to him in restaurants or at Circuit City and they go, hey.
[01:23:48.883 --> 01:23:51.444]  And they call him names and they go, what's your problem speaking English?
[01:23:52.068 --> 01:23:53.408]  You're only allowed to speak Spanish.
[01:23:53.469 --> 01:23:56.009]  It's almost like a mafia type thing.
[01:23:56.049 --> 01:23:57.710]  Have you and others gone through that?
[01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.670]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:00.511]  This has been ongoing for years.
[01:24:00.831 --> 01:24:04.732]  And in particular, the last couple of years when they were really exposed for what they truly are.
[01:24:05.313 --> 01:24:07.513]  They will, in fact, call you names.
[01:24:07.573 --> 01:24:08.774]  They refuse to speak English.
[01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:09.614]  They're not going to learn it.
[01:24:09.654 --> 01:24:10.794]  They are here to take over.
[01:24:10.814 --> 01:24:16.156]  And again, it may sound like I'm double-talking everything, but those are facts.
[01:24:16.576 --> 01:24:17.317]  They are so bold.
[01:24:17.357 --> 01:24:18.057]  They're aggressive.
[01:24:18.077 --> 01:24:20.758]  They're no longer like the old-time Bracero that was honorable.
[01:24:21.178 --> 01:24:22.280]  They have dignity.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:26.225]  They came here to work specifically for doing that and then once they completed their
[01:24:26.673 --> 01:24:32.754]  Their term of being here, whether it was over the summer, the winter, whatever, they go back home and they come back the following year.
[01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:34.955]  They're not here to do jobs Americans won't do.
[01:24:34.995 --> 01:24:38.095]  They're here to completely take over, and they're not somodely doing it.
[01:24:38.215 --> 01:24:39.876]  And they've been getting away with it for years.
[01:24:40.216 --> 01:24:46.377]  Well, I know people who are white in L.A., and it's all over the city who are chefs.
[01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:50.698]  They can hardly get jobs now because the Mexican crews in there will run them off.
[01:24:50.758 --> 01:24:54.539]  They say, listen, this is a Mexican or Latin American...
[01:24:56.079 --> 01:24:57.340]  Well, they constantly say that, and...
[01:25:19.344 --> 01:25:20.545]  Well, it's a double standard.
[01:25:20.565 --> 01:25:24.529]  I've sent this message many times to President Fox to look in the mirror.
[01:25:40.764 --> 01:25:42.746]  And see what he sees, because you're right.
[01:25:42.806 --> 01:25:44.567]  What they do is they do protect their borders.
[01:25:45.127 --> 01:25:49.931]  And by the way, they're fine, as I understand it.
[01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:52.312]  It's either $25,000 or $28,520 in two years in prison.
[01:25:52.753 --> 01:25:56.215]  And I'm sure that the prisons are nowhere near what ours are like.
[01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.917]  Ours are Disneyland by comparison.
[01:25:59.297 --> 01:26:00.078]  But that's what happens.
[01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:04.641]  They do protect their borders, but we're not allowed to do so in America because it's inhumane.
[01:26:05.791 --> 01:26:07.052]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:10.234]  You know, I'm trying to understand where this is all going.
[01:26:10.274 --> 01:26:12.915]  What do you predict is going to happen in the next few years?
[01:26:12.975 --> 01:26:17.838]  Because at a lot of these rallies, they have big signs, including Austin, saying violent revolution is the only way.
[01:26:17.979 --> 01:26:18.999]  Start the violence now.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.700]  They've been wanting to do that.
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:28.205]  This is why they've been provoking not only America, but now they're provoking the Minutemen.
[01:26:28.245 --> 01:26:33.748]  They want us to get involved in some form of altercation so they can get rid of us.
[01:26:33.808 --> 01:26:34.809]  Well, that's not going to happen.
[01:26:35.245 --> 01:26:36.406]  I'll tell you what is going to happen.
[01:26:36.906 --> 01:26:39.387]  We are going to seal the borders one way or the other.
[01:26:39.587 --> 01:26:40.327]  We've got plans.
[01:26:41.008 --> 01:26:50.312]  And the minute you seal the borders, you also address the illegal immigration issue in terms of the hiring of these illegals, because that is, in fact, a crime.
[01:26:50.652 --> 01:26:51.612]  We're addressing that.
[01:26:51.732 --> 01:26:55.254]  Once that happens, there is no reason for amnesty or guest worker programs.
[01:26:55.274 --> 01:26:59.516]  They will be locked in, positioned where they will have to come out of the shadows one way or the other.
[01:27:00.116 --> 01:27:04.458]  And I've been approached and asked, well, how are all these people going to be deported?
[01:27:04.518 --> 01:27:04.638]  Well,
[01:27:05.419 --> 01:27:09.904]  If you do it, you just do it one by one, and you will succeed.
[01:27:11.286 --> 01:27:12.587]  Well, it's a big job.
[01:27:12.607 --> 01:27:17.993]  They had 1,000 arrests, supposedly, of employers and illegal aliens a few days ago, but that is only .00004.
[01:27:19.075 --> 01:27:21.437]  That's correct.
[01:27:21.517 --> 01:27:24.521]  I overheard that conversation you were having earlier, and I agree with you.
[01:27:25.786 --> 01:27:29.267]  And if we grabbed 1,000 a day, that'd be less than 1% in a year.
[01:27:29.627 --> 01:27:31.548]  So we need to... It's simple.
[01:27:31.648 --> 01:27:36.369]  I mean, if you had millions of drunk drivers driving around, the police would arrest them and they'd go to jail.
[01:27:36.549 --> 01:27:37.110]  That's correct.
[01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:40.551]  Well, every time they catch somebody illegal, ship them out of here.
[01:27:40.931 --> 01:27:42.531]  Well, there's laws for the United States.
[01:27:42.571 --> 01:27:44.732]  We're a nation under the rule of law.
[01:27:45.307 --> 01:27:50.430]  We've got rules and laws for American citizens and no rules and no laws for illegal aliens.
[01:27:50.491 --> 01:27:50.791]  Why?
[01:27:51.231 --> 01:27:55.694]  Again, I think it's been a plan all along and they've been told from the very top.
[01:27:55.754 --> 01:27:57.515]  In fact, I'll give you another classic example.
[01:27:58.556 --> 01:28:05.360]  Not too long ago, they pulled over an automobile where I know for a fact each and every one of them, there were four or five of them in this automobile.
[01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:11.985]  They were driving towards the 10, which is not far from where I live.
[01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:14.742]  Probably making their way into Tucson.
[01:28:14.762 --> 01:28:20.867]  They got pulled over, and the only thing they could do, they couldn't arrest them, because they're out of jurisdiction in so doing.
[01:28:21.207 --> 01:28:21.927]  They can't cite them.
[01:28:21.967 --> 01:28:23.469]  I mean, who are you going to cite?
[01:28:23.489 --> 01:28:25.150]  Is it David, Roberto, Julian?
[01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:33.518]  The bottom line is that the only thing they're allowed to do is call the Border Patrol, only to take them right down to Mexico and have them tracked back again the following morning.
[01:28:33.798 --> 01:28:35.119]  This goes on and on all the time.
[01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:37.161]  So it's a revolving door.
[01:28:37.381 --> 01:28:37.921]  Stay right there.
[01:28:37.941 --> 01:28:43.926]  We'll talk about solutions and other key facets of this when we get back with Al Garza.
[01:28:44.867 --> 01:28:45.787]  We're on the march.
[01:28:46.248 --> 01:28:47.849]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:51.452]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.435 --> 01:28:56.256]  Come on, Bill.
[01:28:56.476 --> 01:29:01.660]  Two weeks ago you were riding the bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.481]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:29:03.581 --> 01:29:05.562]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:29:05.842 --> 01:29:11.366]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:17.910]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:20.452]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:29:20.752 --> 01:29:23.614]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[01:29:24.114 --> 01:29:27.557]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:29:27.798 --> 01:29:28.198]  Whoa.
[01:29:28.598 --> 01:29:29.799]  What was that website again?
[01:29:29.879 --> 01:29:33.363]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:29:33.663 --> 01:29:34.784]  Now write this down, John.
[01:29:34.924 --> 01:29:39.228]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:29:39.368 --> 01:29:39.949]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:41.430]  I'm going there right now.
[01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:42.471]  Check, please.
[01:29:44.257 --> 01:29:45.698]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:29:46.198 --> 01:29:46.778]  Sure, John.
[01:29:47.019 --> 01:29:51.381]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:51.681 --> 01:29:53.362]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:29:53.542 --> 01:29:53.802]  Deal.
[01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:59.454]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:29:59.654 --> 01:30:04.098]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:30:04.278 --> 01:30:18.290]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two black Berkey purification elements.
[01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:37.718]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.

[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.381]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:55.888]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:30:56.249 --> 01:31:00.191]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:31:00.572 --> 01:31:04.094]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:31:04.474 --> 01:31:08.017]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[01:31:08.417 --> 01:31:13.281]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them,
[01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:19.408]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:31:19.708 --> 01:31:25.855]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:31:26.195 --> 01:31:31.962]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:31:32.382 --> 01:31:33.563]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:31:33.884 --> 01:31:35.005]  Don't take my word for it.

[01:31:40.711 --> 01:31:44.174]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:31:44.455 --> 01:31:45.756]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:31:45.796 --> 01:31:46.076]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:31:55.524 --> 01:31:58.305]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:58.845 --> 01:32:02.186]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.147 --> 01:32:10.709]  I want to bring up some other issues with the National Director of the Minutemen Project, Al Garza.
[01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:18.472]  When you talk about illegal aliens from China, Mexico, Russia, wherever, bringing in diseases, they go, oh, that's a code word for racism.
[01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:18.792]  No.
[01:32:18.812 --> 01:32:24.374]  They're having to open up huge tuberculosis wards again, something we didn't have in the last 30 years.
[01:32:25.999 --> 01:32:28.841]  We had had the Associated Press run a report on this last year.
[01:32:28.881 --> 01:32:29.261]  What was it?
[01:32:29.301 --> 01:32:32.703]  Three cases of wet leprosy in a 10-year period.
[01:32:33.364 --> 01:32:36.926]  And then in 2005, we had 7,000 cases.
[01:32:37.446 --> 01:32:40.728]  And out in East Texas, the government's opened a huge leper colony.
[01:32:42.469 --> 01:32:45.071]  Drug-resistant immune TB is spreading everywhere.
[01:32:45.151 --> 01:32:54.238]  I mean, what American, whether you're black, white, purple polka-dotted, I don't care, wants your kids in these public schools sitting next to the illegal alien children coughing TB?
[01:32:54.258 --> 01:32:55.298]  There's not even a test done!
[01:32:55.499 --> 01:32:57.180]  They don't even want to treat and help the kids!
[01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:02.773]  I mean, in Ellis Island, when people came in, they had to give a clean bill of health.
[01:33:03.373 --> 01:33:04.755]  Now, it's just unlimited.
[01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:15.844]  And there was a statistic out of North Carolina where 24% of the year's accidents, the serious injury or fatality accidents, were illegal aliens, and nothing happens to them.
[01:33:15.864 --> 01:33:19.186]  We had the railway killer running around murdering, getting released all the time.
[01:33:19.907 --> 01:33:20.427]  Imagine.
[01:33:20.467 --> 01:33:22.809]  I mean, it's not just that they say, this is our land, we're taking over.
[01:33:22.869 --> 01:33:24.250]  It's, we're not going to follow any laws.
[01:33:24.811 --> 01:33:28.694]  And all over the country, sheriffs have said, listen, we called the Border Patrol, and they say, we're not coming.
[01:33:30.393 --> 01:33:34.757]  Al Garza, you want to comment on the subjects I've just mentioned?
[01:33:34.777 --> 01:33:37.679]  I mean, we've got an above-the-law group of 20-plus million people here.
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:38.700]  Well, that's right.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.223]  Border of entry is really essential in this case and in cases like this.
[01:33:42.704 --> 01:33:45.786]  This is why we've got Border Patrol and we do have ports of entry.
[01:33:46.147 --> 01:33:49.550]  They go through and they keep coming back with the fact that we're racist.
[01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:52.152]  Well, the bottom line is we're not racist, as you well mentioned.
[01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:54.274]  We are under the rule of law.
[01:33:54.554 --> 01:33:55.815]  We're concerned about rule of law.
[01:33:56.556 --> 01:33:57.957]  We want to enforce our laws.
[01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:01.152]  Well, we're concerned about public safety and national security.
[01:34:01.192 --> 01:34:07.878]  That includes diseases, terrorists, and in fact, speaking of terrorism, I mean, this is nothing less than terrorism.
[01:34:08.238 --> 01:34:15.244]  When they're coming through your property and nonchalantly just walking through and flipping you off and, you know, they've got the United States upside down.
[01:34:15.264 --> 01:34:19.608]  They've got... This is nothing less than terrorism.
[01:34:19.808 --> 01:34:21.049]  This is exactly what they're doing.
[01:34:21.409 --> 01:34:24.252]  They don't have to go through the ports of entry because it's too long of a wait.
[01:34:24.692 --> 01:34:26.874]  They're in a hurry because they've got to feed their families.
[01:34:27.347 --> 01:34:29.188]  And, of course, at our expense.
[01:34:29.648 --> 01:34:31.609]  If we don't accommodate them, well, we become racist.
[01:34:31.689 --> 01:34:33.470]  If we don't accommodate them, we're inhumane.
[01:34:33.671 --> 01:34:40.494]  And ACLU and all these other, La Raza and Aslan, all these other people, first thing you want to do is take somebody to court.
[01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:42.776]  And that's going to stop, too.
[01:34:42.856 --> 01:34:52.721]  Eventually, all this is going to stop, chiefly because we are demanding with fences, we're demanding border patrol, we're demanding the military, we're demanding that we restore the rule of law.
[01:34:52.821 --> 01:34:54.642]  Once that happens, you clean house.
[01:34:54.702 --> 01:34:56.063]  And that's really what the bottom line is.
[01:34:58.135 --> 01:35:06.799]  Let me just read, and then I want to talk about some of the projects you guys are launching right now valiantly, and then I want to take some calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:35:07.239 --> 01:35:18.424]  There are several letters to the editor this week in the Chronicle that's attacking anyone that wants to control our borders and anyone who's upset about 20-plus million people running around saying we're taking over.
[01:35:19.193 --> 01:35:21.335]  And by the way, they get more welfare, more tuition.
[01:35:21.395 --> 01:35:26.280]  A lot of states roll out the red carpet on purpose because the big banker boys like Bush want this.
[01:35:26.881 --> 01:35:29.343]  But there are multiple letters to the editor just like this one.
[01:35:29.744 --> 01:35:32.146]  And this is from Carlos R. Garza, U.S.
[01:35:32.206 --> 01:35:33.107]  Air Force retired.
[01:35:34.108 --> 01:35:36.210]  Dear Editor... Let me... The paper's big here.
[01:35:36.250 --> 01:35:38.493]  I'm trying to get it here where I can read it.
[01:35:38.513 --> 01:35:38.773]  Sorry.
[01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:43.751]  Dear editor, here are some basic truths as I see them.
[01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:49.473]  The illegal immigrants in this country are making minor contributions to our economy as they always have in the past.
[01:35:50.214 --> 01:35:54.635]  They have become a larger economic burden on our public health, education, and welfare system.
[01:35:54.675 --> 01:35:58.536]  Like so many of the working poor in this country, they cannot afford health care.
[01:35:59.077 --> 01:36:08.540]  These economic refugees, what they truly are, have exposed the greatest failure of our foreign policy in the 20th century, economic justice.
[01:36:09.841 --> 01:36:17.085]  China and India have booming economies now, and have done so largely because of so much aid from the United States.
[01:36:17.125 --> 01:36:24.810]  The culture of Latin America has yet to throw off the strict patron-peon-calf system inherited from Spanish colonial rule.
[01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:28.892]  Until they do that, their economies will continue to flounder and fail.
[01:36:30.473 --> 01:36:34.055]  Mexico is a country rich in both natural—they have double the oil we do—
[01:36:34.935 --> 01:36:42.039]  Natural and human resources, but yet it has failed to develop economically so that most of its people can look forward to a better life.
[01:36:42.919 --> 01:36:45.000]  There's now a huge double standard in this country.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.181]  Working in this country without a permit is a crime.
[01:36:47.562 --> 01:36:51.263]  Any illegal immigrant is allowed to walk around free in this country without fear of prosecution.
[01:36:53.144 --> 01:36:55.005]  And it goes on with government benefits.
[01:36:56.006 --> 01:37:02.189]  And it goes on, but 200,000 troops are kept in harm's way protecting foreign oil fields in the name of economic stability.
[01:37:02.794 --> 01:37:09.078]  If a GI commits a crime in that country, he will be prosecuted, but an illegal alien won't in this country.
[01:37:09.558 --> 01:37:19.403]  I feel it's the greatest betrayal of our military veterans who have served our country to spend a penny on assistance for illegal immigrants or foreign aid of any kind.
[01:37:19.463 --> 01:37:21.324]  Let's take care of our vets first.
[01:37:21.945 --> 01:37:23.365]  Carlos Argarza, U.S.
[01:37:23.425 --> 01:37:25.687]  Air Force, retired out of Hudson Bend, Texas.
[01:37:26.167 --> 01:37:28.008]  That's a very well-composed letter.
[01:37:29.597 --> 01:37:37.881]  Well, there's others here, but they keep trying to bully Hispanic Americans who are the majority, saying, shut up, shut up, calling them names, you, you, shut up.
[01:37:38.421 --> 01:37:39.161]  We're taking over.
[01:37:39.481 --> 01:37:40.842]  Yeah, well, we're not going to shut up.
[01:37:40.902 --> 01:37:48.905]  They're hearing our voice flat and clear, and we're echoing it, and we're going to continue doing so until we shut everything down.
[01:37:49.466 --> 01:37:53.007]  And we said, as he well mentioned, they're breaking their laws.
[01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:55.028]  Once you start incarcerating these individuals...
[01:37:55.549 --> 01:38:06.056]  And I think if we allow the sheriff's department, our local authorities, to do their job, which, for example, our own governor refuses to do, if we allow them to do their job, we would not have this problem.
[01:38:06.856 --> 01:38:07.657]  That's where you start.
[01:38:07.697 --> 01:38:12.139]  You start by enforcing the law and going into the educational end of it.
[01:38:12.159 --> 01:38:14.301]  We are educating children at our expense.
[01:38:14.341 --> 01:38:23.907]  And, by the way, these kids that are getting educated will eventually and ultimately wind up being your leaders because they get free education, no cost to them,
[01:38:24.443 --> 01:38:29.687]  And they have one thing in mind, again, going right back to the same old cliche, Mexico takeover.
[01:38:29.767 --> 01:38:30.528]  That's their plan.
[01:38:32.029 --> 01:38:32.750]  We better beware.
[01:38:33.010 --> 01:38:34.791]  Well, they call it the La Reconquista.
[01:38:34.991 --> 01:38:36.373]  That's exactly what that means.
[01:38:36.853 --> 01:38:41.757]  Well, my wife speaks Spanish because she lived for many years in Spain, in Madrid.
[01:38:42.759 --> 01:38:43.239]  We're good to go.
[01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:06.893]  I mean, if they'll march up to Hispanic Americans and say, hey, you better speak Spanish, buddy, you traitor.
[01:39:07.713 --> 01:39:13.496]  I mean, I guess as soon as illegals get here, and also when they're in Mexico, they're taught that the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[01:39:13.516 --> 01:39:23.101]  And again, our own schools here in America are colluding on this because they don't tell them that a third of the people in the war for Texas independence were Hispanic.
[01:39:23.361 --> 01:39:29.144]  They don't tell them that a Hispanic man wrote the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and is seen as the founder of the Texas Constitution.
[01:39:29.464 --> 01:39:30.605]  They don't tell them any of that.
[01:39:31.085 --> 01:39:32.026]  Well, that's very true.
[01:39:32.046 --> 01:39:52.838]  And I may be wrong in saying 100% of these people that are coming in are dedicating their efforts to an agenda that I'm talking about, but the bulk of them do, because I've seen and I've talked to a lot of them, and the ones that I've spoken to, they have that attitude, that aggressiveness, that brutal type of attitude.
[01:39:54.295 --> 01:39:55.876]  Because they've been educated to do so.
[01:39:55.976 --> 01:40:00.118]  They're educated in Mexico, and obviously they've got organizations out here that are giving them a handout.
[01:40:00.298 --> 01:40:07.943]  Sir, I was in the interior of Yucatan, right up against the, just 10 miles or so from the border of Guatemala a few months ago, and down there for a week.
[01:40:09.418 --> 01:40:09.998]  It's a plan.
[01:40:10.038 --> 01:40:13.200]  As I said before, my father is the one that really opened my eyes on it.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.102]  And then once I woke up, I began to smell the coffee.
[01:40:37.839 --> 01:40:38.340]  That's their plan, pal.
[01:41:00.945 --> 01:41:02.187]  Well, that's the globalization.
[01:41:02.227 --> 01:41:06.472]  Our government wants us to turn into the Pan-American Union, and they're going to use this rent-a-mod to do it.
[01:41:06.492 --> 01:41:09.335]  You know, you have these amnesty groups, you have these sanctuary groups.
[01:41:10.417 --> 01:41:12.860]  This one lady from Chicago, I've heard her on multiple shows.
[01:41:13.743 --> 01:41:23.028]  People will call in, including myself, and go, Hey, the plan of La Rica Enquista, La Raza's motto is for those inside the race, everything.
[01:41:23.048 --> 01:41:24.248]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[01:41:24.608 --> 01:41:25.809]  And she'll go, You're a total liar.
[01:41:25.849 --> 01:41:26.509]  It's all made up.
[01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:28.370]  She speaks English perfectly.
[01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:32.152]  You go to her website, and you go to their websites, and in Spanish it says all that.
[01:41:32.392 --> 01:41:36.754]  So they're also real slick about going on the English media and lying.
[01:41:36.995 --> 01:41:41.657]  Then meanwhile, the Spanish media, usually owned by old white men, is saying exactly that.
[01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:52.132]  I, in fact, just yesterday, just to confirm what you're talking about, just yesterday, just before I went to three points, I glued myself to the Mexican news on the radio.
[01:41:52.412 --> 01:41:53.993]  And that's exactly what they were broadcasting.
[01:41:54.353 --> 01:41:56.515]  You hurry up and get into the United States.
[01:41:56.535 --> 01:41:58.817]  The smell of amnesty is in the air.
[01:41:59.158 --> 01:42:00.919]  You go there and get a piece of the action.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.861]  You do whatever you've got to do.
[01:42:02.901 --> 01:42:03.481]  You get there.
[01:42:03.602 --> 01:42:06.364]  And by the way, take over North Carolina.
[01:42:06.444 --> 01:42:09.707]  Now, there must be a reason for North Carolina being one of their targets.
[01:42:10.722 --> 01:42:13.284]  That was disclosed effective yesterday.
[01:42:13.825 --> 01:42:21.630]  And the guy that's doing this talking by the name of El Cucuy, I believe his name is, he's been in our country three or five years.
[01:42:22.211 --> 01:42:23.291]  He came here illegally.
[01:42:23.892 --> 01:42:25.233]  He went in to pick strawberries.
[01:42:25.533 --> 01:42:31.757]  He worked hard labor for these people to come into our country and completely invade us.
[01:42:31.918 --> 01:42:36.521]  Sir, we have two stations in town with names like The Invader, The Rebel.
[01:42:37.362 --> 01:42:39.024]  And on it is just, we are taking over.
[01:42:39.104 --> 01:42:39.705]  Move forward.
[01:42:39.765 --> 01:42:40.445]  Strike, strike.
[01:42:40.606 --> 01:42:41.526]  Take over everything.
[01:42:41.567 --> 01:42:42.988]  Don't buy nothing from the gringos.
[01:42:43.008 --> 01:42:43.709]  They are your enemy.
[01:42:44.309 --> 01:42:45.971]  Meanwhile, it's owned by gringos.
[01:42:46.412 --> 01:42:49.174]  It's all a big, sick joke to break down this country.
[01:42:49.975 --> 01:42:57.583]  The poor Mexicans that are coming in knew that they're just ensuring that they'll continue to be slaves, and all Americans are going to be peons now.
[01:42:58.043 --> 01:42:58.904]  I mean, imagine...
[01:42:59.865 --> 01:43:03.647]  It's like Tokyo Rose in World War II going, lay down, GI.
[01:43:03.707 --> 01:43:07.990]  And what was the name of the lady that would come on and tell the GIs to lay down in Vietnam?
[01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:08.970]  Yeah.
[01:43:11.772 --> 01:43:18.716]  But instead, it's literally military-style transmissions going 24 hours a day.
[01:43:20.177 --> 01:43:24.979]  And it's perfect because it's another language, and so the English speakers don't know.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:26.920]  Well, that's true.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:27.621]  As a matter of fact...
[01:43:28.463 --> 01:43:30.024]  These people are being exploited.
[01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:38.568]  They really have the advantage over the American citizen that is paying tax because they come in and they do labor themselves for cheap wages.
[01:43:38.908 --> 01:43:39.548]  But guess what?
[01:43:40.528 --> 01:43:42.709]  They also go on and apply for welfare and qualify.
[01:43:42.729 --> 01:43:43.650]  They know exactly.
[01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:44.630]  They're well connected.
[01:43:44.690 --> 01:43:50.393]  They know exactly who to go to and when to go to this particular bunch of people that are working in the welfare department.
[01:43:50.673 --> 01:43:52.934]  They walk out of there with benefits that we can't enjoy.
[01:43:53.482 --> 01:43:57.066]  So they can afford to go out and work for six, seven, eight, ten dollars an hour.
[01:43:57.306 --> 01:43:58.207]  But that's all cash.
[01:43:59.028 --> 01:44:03.509]  But they're getting subsidized by our own tax dollars in terms of the medical, the welfare.
[01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:11.771]  Well, also, Vicente Fox, three years ago, and I bullhorned him and shut down his press conference, he came to Austin, he gave an award to the police chief for not enforcing the law.
[01:44:12.011 --> 01:44:13.251]  He said, here's an award.
[01:44:13.571 --> 01:44:28.354]  He gave an award to Wells Fargo for issuing debit cards with any fake name, and then the government in Texas is accepting those, and Perry's head chief of Texas-Mexico relations, he is a registered lobbyist of Vicente Fox.
[01:44:29.394 --> 01:44:30.755]  That was in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:44:31.135 --> 01:44:35.458]  And then the government called up threatening the writer that reported that saying that's secret information.
[01:44:35.778 --> 01:44:42.041]  So a foreign national from Mexico who works for Fox is paid running our policies for Rick Perry.
[01:44:42.962 --> 01:44:49.205]  Well, and that's not new to me because you've got governors, you've got mayors, you've got police, you've got detectives.
[01:44:49.485 --> 01:44:50.666]  You might even have FBI.
[01:44:50.686 --> 01:44:52.727]  You've got personnel working in welfare.
[01:44:53.667 --> 01:44:54.928]  All these people are plants.
[01:44:55.655 --> 01:45:08.040]  And infiltrators that, again, going right back to the invasion... Well, it's like the former head of the Border Patrol, what, five years ago, for what, a four-year term before that, he was the former head of the Ford Foundation.
[01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:09.661]  I know.
[01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:10.841]  I know.
[01:45:10.861 --> 01:45:18.144]  Well, what's happening is that these... Well, Vicente Fox and his Foxy regime have...
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:26.644]  Well, being connected with these other people, they're putting up... Well, let's take, for example, the mayor in Los Angeles.
[01:45:27.404 --> 01:45:29.885]  This guy that claims to be of Mexican descent.
[01:45:30.005 --> 01:45:33.047]  Antonio Ria... Yeah, Ria Vassa, or whatever his name is.
[01:45:33.087 --> 01:45:34.407]  Via Rosa, something like that.
[01:45:34.907 --> 01:45:44.692]  He's, again, very boldly declared that not only are the Minutemen going to be completely wiped out, that his intention is to make sure that the Mexicans...
[01:45:45.345 --> 01:45:46.606]  And he didn't say American.
[01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:48.128]  He didn't say Mexican-American.
[01:45:48.148 --> 01:45:52.933]  He just said the Mexicans have every right to be here, and we're going to make sure that their rights are enforced.
[01:45:53.193 --> 01:45:58.598]  Well, he has said in years past, before he was mayor, when he was just a council member, he has said that this is Mexico.
[01:45:58.979 --> 01:46:01.601]  Absolutely, and you ought to see the signs out there in Los Angeles.
[01:46:01.882 --> 01:46:04.785]  Loretta Sanchez, what is she, some representative from out there,
[01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:05.925]  The same thing.
[01:46:05.945 --> 01:46:06.986]  She's got the same agenda.
[01:46:07.246 --> 01:46:16.208]  Well, they put up 675 huge billboards saying, this is Mexico, and it was paid for by the white owner of the TV network.
[01:46:16.448 --> 01:46:16.908]  That's correct.
[01:46:16.928 --> 01:46:23.410]  There's a sign up there in Los Angeles that says, Los Angeles, and they erase California and put Mexico on it.
[01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:25.431]  It goes on all the time, and they get away with it.
[01:46:26.231 --> 01:46:32.933]  Well, basically, the white ruling elite in America, the establishment, who loves people like the communist butcher who...
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:43.252]  They love it, and they are just mobilizing a foreign army that they can use to push around Americans as America goes into the Pan-American Union.
[01:46:43.272 --> 01:46:43.853]  It's simple.
[01:46:44.294 --> 01:46:44.714]  That's right.
[01:46:44.774 --> 01:46:45.736]  They don't have to fire a road.
[01:46:47.168 --> 01:46:47.768]  Not one round.
[01:46:47.869 --> 01:46:49.710]  When you talk to the illegal aliens, do they understand?
[01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:57.514]  I mean, it's now proven that Bush's PR firm with Fox financed these protests, financed all of this, and it's all staged.
[01:46:58.055 --> 01:47:01.977]  I mean, do some of these illegal alien Mexicans, do they understand that they're being manipulated?
[01:47:02.478 --> 01:47:13.424]  Well, I think they do understand, but they go with it because they know it's to their advantage in the long run because a lot of them have actually received dollars from lawsuits.
[01:47:14.065 --> 01:47:15.125]  They carry in their wallet.
[01:47:15.145 --> 01:47:16.046]  We have found wallets.
[01:47:16.716 --> 01:47:17.737]  It's a military... It's scary!
[01:47:17.817 --> 01:47:18.437]  It is, it's scary.
[01:47:18.917 --> 01:47:20.378]  In fact, we're not kidding about this.
[01:47:36.301 --> 01:47:37.142]  Not at all.
[01:47:37.182 --> 01:47:45.046]  We have found literature from Arabia, China, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Jamaica, you name it.
[01:47:45.426 --> 01:47:49.408]  I think it was 86 or 87 different countries so far that we found literature on.
[01:47:49.789 --> 01:47:56.532]  Let's take a quick call, and we're going to get out your website and cover some of the things you guys are going to be doing in the future and how folks can support you.
[01:47:57.313 --> 01:48:01.035]  Let's talk to Al in Pennsylvania, then Sean, Jim, and others.
[01:48:01.075 --> 01:48:01.635]  Go ahead, Al.
[01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:03.116]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:48:04.297 --> 01:48:04.477]  Good.
[01:48:04.517 --> 01:48:04.797]  Go ahead.
[01:48:05.293 --> 01:48:16.421]  I was brought up to a little understanding of Lithuanian history, and when the Russians wanted to integrate the Lithuanian people into the Soviet Union, they sent in colonists to mix up the culture and Russianize the population.
[01:48:17.121 --> 01:48:20.843]  And when I look at the American Southwest, I've got to say I see the same kind of thing happening.
[01:48:20.883 --> 01:48:23.825]  Oh, they call it the re-colonization or the re-conquista.
[01:48:24.826 --> 01:48:27.348]  And the Lithuanian people never gave in to that stuff.
[01:48:27.368 --> 01:48:29.029]  They always held their language and their culture.
[01:48:29.489 --> 01:48:33.452]  And the Russian colonists that came to Lithuania always ended up speaking Lithuanian and
[01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:35.811]  Well, that's affirmative.
[01:48:35.831 --> 01:48:36.552]  I tend to agree with him.
[01:48:36.572 --> 01:48:41.593]  What's going on is that a lot of these people are now suing, and I think Americans are afraid of courts, obviously, so...
[01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:05.261]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:05.321 --> 01:49:06.902]  Anything else, Al, for Al?
[01:49:07.002 --> 01:49:07.502]  No, that's it.
[01:49:07.542 --> 01:49:11.105]  We've got to try to resist that kind of stuff and take examples from history.
[01:49:28.464 --> 01:49:30.305]  And maintain our nationalism is all I have to say.
[01:49:30.806 --> 01:49:31.186]  I agree.
[01:49:31.206 --> 01:49:35.769]  You know, another example is the communist Chinese force all Tibetan women to marry Chinese.
[01:49:36.249 --> 01:49:37.450]  They're destroying that culture.
[01:49:37.951 --> 01:49:38.991]  It's totally sick.
[01:49:39.011 --> 01:49:39.652]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:43.832 --> 01:49:51.221]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:49:51.482 --> 01:49:56.227]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:49:56.448 --> 01:50:02.115]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:02.335 --> 01:50:06.877]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:07.077 --> 01:50:14.219]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:14.239 --> 01:50:18.781]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:18.941 --> 01:50:21.462]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:21.682 --> 01:50:28.404]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:28.644 --> 01:50:33.887]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:33.907 --> 01:50:34.328]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:42.845 --> 01:50:51.087]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:50:51.347 --> 01:50:55.708]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:50:56.008 --> 01:51:04.910]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:08.731]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:09.031 --> 01:51:14.057]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:14.358 --> 01:51:21.086]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:51:21.587 --> 01:51:22.127]  What about you?
[01:51:22.868 --> 01:51:28.213]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:50.223 --> 01:51:52.465]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:51:52.665 --> 01:51:59.029]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:51:59.349 --> 01:52:00.009]  We're good to go.
[01:52:19.701 --> 01:52:19.981]  Imagine!
[01:52:50.049 --> 01:53:01.155]  Being a white guy from Central Texas, brought up by parents that I wouldn't call liberal, but I would call educated and not taught to dislike anybody, playing football and baseball with blacks and Hispanics.
[01:53:01.195 --> 01:53:02.376]  Everybody always got along.
[01:53:02.396 --> 01:53:16.304]  And then going to college and hearing America's bad and that America's going to be taken over by Mexico and then seeing it being set up and hearing that I have to die, that my son, when he turns 16, will have to be taken and exterminated.
[01:53:17.431 --> 01:53:24.478]  Because all white males by the age of 16, and then now the big UT professor says, no, we just have to kill all whites.
[01:53:25.963 --> 01:53:36.809]  I mean, imagine hearing that, and then the radio stations are saying, we're taking over, take over, take over, and then PR firms are handing out American flags, but the American quiches won't listen and wave the Mexican flags.
[01:53:37.689 --> 01:53:40.031]  Al Garza, that did backfire on him.
[01:53:40.071 --> 01:53:48.555]  How big of a backfire do you think it was that Americans really got their wake-up call with tens of millions of illegals running around waving Mexican flags, foaming at the mouth?
[01:53:49.304 --> 01:53:52.787]  The big backfire, and I'll tell you why.
[01:53:52.807 --> 01:54:07.198]  Not shortly after all these incidents occurred, the protests, that is, we began to receive calls from nationwide, how they could help the Minutemen, could they volunteer, could they give us donations, and we went from 6,500 in a matter of days to almost 8,000 volunteers.
[01:54:11.621 --> 01:54:13.604]  Well, that's how Americans have always been.
[01:54:28.263 --> 01:54:28.923]  How would you say that?
[01:54:28.963 --> 01:54:30.564]  Tight family of Americans.
[01:54:31.104 --> 01:54:32.625]  We defend and protect each other.
[01:54:32.945 --> 01:54:39.408]  The bottom line is that most of these people have been completely oblivious to what the agenda has really been all about.
[01:54:39.768 --> 01:54:43.730]  We have compassion, and these people know how to thrive on our compassion.
[01:54:44.130 --> 01:54:45.250]  And again, that's going to stop.
[01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:46.411]  No more compassion.
[01:54:47.171 --> 01:54:48.692]  Rule of law, back to rule of law.
[01:54:49.092 --> 01:54:51.673]  Public safety, national security, the rest is going to be history.
[01:54:52.233 --> 01:54:52.914]  Seal the border.
[01:54:52.974 --> 01:54:53.674]  That's the bottom line.
[01:54:55.006 --> 01:54:55.966]  Well, absolutely.
[01:54:56.006 --> 01:54:58.747]  Give out the website one more time for the Minutemen Project.
[01:54:58.768 --> 01:54:59.528]  Absolutely.
[01:54:59.548 --> 01:55:04.090]  That is Minutemen, single word, HQ.com.
[01:55:04.110 --> 01:55:07.891]  You'll get any and all information you want, how to donate, how to volunteer.
[01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:11.052]  You'll get the history, SOPs, our training manual is in there.
[01:55:11.532 --> 01:55:13.113]  Our media department is in there.
[01:55:13.173 --> 01:55:14.794]  You've got anything and everything you need there.
[01:55:14.874 --> 01:55:16.494]  We're about to go to Jim and others that are holding.
[01:55:16.514 --> 01:55:18.675]  We're going to keep Mr. Garza with us into the next hour.
[01:55:18.755 --> 01:55:20.116]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:55:23.519 --> 01:55:24.840]  But I want to ask you this now.
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:26.182]  What do you see in the future?
[01:55:26.482 --> 01:55:28.784]  You're a combat Marine Corps veteran in Vietnam.
[01:55:28.804 --> 01:55:30.946]  You've lived a lot.
[01:55:30.986 --> 01:55:32.307]  You're an older gentleman, retired.
[01:55:32.748 --> 01:55:33.889]  You've seen a lot in life.
[01:55:34.309 --> 01:55:35.590]  Where do you see this going?
[01:55:35.610 --> 01:55:38.473]  Where does your 84-year-old father see this going?
[01:55:38.493 --> 01:55:39.534]  Do you think we're going to win this?
[01:55:40.054 --> 01:55:40.875]  We are going to win it.
[01:55:41.215 --> 01:55:43.718]  Now, we would not have won it, and I'm not going to take...
[01:55:44.278 --> 01:55:44.618]  The Minutemen...
[01:56:13.075 --> 01:56:14.617]  Are hot to trot on it.
[01:56:14.657 --> 01:56:16.018]  You guys are doing a bang-up job.
[01:56:16.358 --> 01:56:18.060]  It's things like this that are going to help out.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:21.763]  I mean, literally, the Minutemen were Paul Revere's.
[01:56:22.064 --> 01:56:24.626]  And then I heard a clip.
[01:56:24.706 --> 01:56:34.335]  You spoke to the mayor saying that, you know, what would happen if Paul Revere wouldn't have ridden and that Paul Revere isn't going to ride this time.
[01:56:34.656 --> 01:56:37.138]  I don't think they've gotten the word that Paul Revere has ridden.
[01:56:37.981 --> 01:56:52.990]  Well, you know, they think that because they're trying to frighten us into saying that they've got all this money, they've got all the backing, for example, again, going back to the old thing, the ACLU is just waiting to see their ambulance.
[01:56:53.090 --> 01:56:56.332]  They're waiting to see how they can sue somebody.
[01:56:56.372 --> 01:56:59.314]  So they figure that they've got us in their pocket, but I've got news for them.
[01:56:59.554 --> 01:56:59.975]  They don't.
[01:57:01.075 --> 01:57:01.996]  We don't frighten that easy.
[01:57:04.145 --> 01:57:12.748]  I agree, and I have to tell you that I haven't been able to wake up these illegal aliens and explain it to them, so I've been able to reach out to them when they get the big picture.
[01:57:12.768 --> 01:57:18.089]  I mean, when they learn that a Bush PR firm is running all of this, I mean, come on.
[01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:21.010]  We'll go right to your calls when we start the third hour.
[01:57:22.611 --> 01:57:27.492]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.705 --> 01:57:39.345]  Big Brother.
[01:57:40.006 --> 01:57:41.086]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:41.787 --> 01:57:42.908]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:43.549 --> 01:57:44.369]  You want answers?
[01:57:45.110 --> 01:57:45.991]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:46.011 --> 01:57:50.614]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:50.855 --> 01:57:54.998]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:02.925]  I hope the Lorican pieces know that the Revolutionary War...
[01:58:04.671 --> 01:58:16.235]  In that seven and a half year war starting in 1776 on April 19th, I hope they know that on average, the colonial forces fought six to one odds.
[01:58:17.015 --> 01:58:26.018]  And I hope they know that Americans, I don't care what color they are, Hispanic, black, white, Asian, who love this country and love our values, are not going to be beaten.
[01:58:27.165 --> 01:58:40.151]  And it's sad to see a people with a history of being slaves to the Spanish government and Santa Ana and then to the PRI and now to the Fox crowd, totally enslaved, would be up here trying to destroy one of the only free countries left.
[01:58:40.251 --> 01:58:41.352]  We're talking to Al Garza.
[01:58:41.952 --> 01:58:44.713]  He is the national director of the Minutemen Project.
[01:58:45.093 --> 01:58:51.096]  We're going to be taking some of your calls right now, but do you have any comments on what I just said about our revolutionary forefathers?
[01:58:51.576 --> 01:58:54.317]  That's what America is all about, and that's what the Minutemen are about.
[01:58:54.438 --> 01:58:55.378]  And I'll tell you something else.
[01:58:55.945 --> 01:58:59.688]  We will stand tall, and if it comes down to toe-to-toe, that's exactly what we'll do.
[01:58:59.988 --> 01:59:01.429]  We will defend and protect America.
[01:59:01.689 --> 01:59:04.011]  That's the oath we've taken, and we'll abide by it.
[01:59:04.931 --> 01:59:07.713]  Let's talk to Jim in Texas and Sean, Malta, and others.
[01:59:07.733 --> 01:59:08.414]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:59:09.354 --> 01:59:09.875]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:10.175 --> 01:59:11.095]  Hi, Mr. Garza.
[01:59:11.316 --> 01:59:12.076]  How are you, sir?
[01:59:12.877 --> 01:59:13.077]  Good.
[01:59:13.377 --> 01:59:23.384]  I come from an industry, construction, that was one of the first to be overwhelmed by the invasion, agriculture probably being the first.
[01:59:24.212 --> 01:59:28.776]  The construction industry has been decimated, beginning at more than 30 years ago.
[01:59:29.197 --> 01:59:38.386]  You used to see a crew of black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and a ton of white European Americans
[01:59:39.298 --> 01:59:40.278]  Doing construction jobs.
[01:59:40.318 --> 01:59:41.459]  Well, they aren't there now.
[01:59:41.879 --> 01:59:42.759]  Yeah, you never.
[01:59:42.819 --> 01:59:43.679]  You never.
[01:59:43.939 --> 01:59:49.981]  I mean, literally, maybe one time out of 50, do you see whites or blacks doing the job because they're leveraged out of the market?
[01:59:50.221 --> 01:59:51.881]  An American has to have insurance.
[01:59:52.182 --> 01:59:53.222]  He's got to pay taxes.
[01:59:53.242 --> 01:59:54.722]  He's got to subsidize the illegals.
[01:59:55.082 --> 01:59:57.263]  When the illegals come in, there's no way to compete against them.
[01:59:57.763 --> 01:59:59.964]  And that's been going on for 30 or 40 years.
[02:00:00.304 --> 02:00:08.426]  And the reason nobody cared was because the average construction worker didn't have much money and they didn't vote.
[02:00:09.264 --> 02:00:38.102]  But speaking of voting, Mr. Garza, you know, preferring the ballot box over the jury box or the ammo box, for example, as an agent of change, I believe that what we end up with is more of a Pandora's box because we can't know, for example, these upcoming elections, we can't know
[02:00:38.601 --> 02:00:40.322]  So what's your point, Jim?
[02:00:40.362 --> 02:00:40.882]  Make a point.
[02:00:40.902 --> 02:00:46.825]  My point is, would either of you agree with me that a candidate for elected office could be...
[02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:09.086]  Quiz on essentially two issues, gun control and abortion.
[02:01:09.807 --> 02:01:11.387]  Two things that China's great at.
[02:01:12.228 --> 02:01:16.110]  Whereby, if you want my guns, you probably want me too.
[02:01:16.811 --> 02:01:20.673]  And if you kill helpless babies, you're certainly not fit to serve in office.
[02:01:22.096 --> 02:01:23.297]  I think that's a good litmus test.
[02:01:23.337 --> 02:01:23.957]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:23.977 --> 02:01:25.739]  You think that's a good test, Mr. Garza?
[02:01:25.839 --> 02:01:26.659]  Well, absolutely.
[02:01:26.679 --> 02:01:37.588]  In addition to that, I think what we should do is we should be considering strongly, as Americans, and I wouldn't be opposed to it, a third party that would go in there and do the job that Americans want done.
[02:01:38.328 --> 02:01:42.572]  There would be a president that's obviously going to control things, and that's what we need.
[02:01:42.732 --> 02:01:49.177]  Right now, we've got the Democrats that are not listening because they want the Hispanic vote, and the Republicans not listening because they want the cheap wages.
[02:01:50.171 --> 02:01:51.512]  So, we're right in the middle.
[02:01:51.812 --> 02:01:52.692]  We're in a crunch.
[02:01:52.712 --> 02:01:55.693]  So, by having a third party, I think it would be a good way to start.
[02:01:56.114 --> 02:01:56.534]  I agree.
[02:01:56.894 --> 02:01:58.635]  And, of course, they also want to break down the borders.
[02:01:58.935 --> 02:01:59.795]  American Union.
[02:02:00.335 --> 02:02:02.596]  Chavez has shot that down for them right now, though.
[02:02:03.096 --> 02:02:05.297]  And, you know, all of this stuff is happening.
[02:02:05.758 --> 02:02:11.720]  And, you know, Chavez was correct when he said, just a few months ago, that America is really controlling Mexico.
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:14.221]  You know, Mexicans think they're taking over America.
[02:02:14.241 --> 02:02:17.483]  No, the big banks in New York are just letting them think that.
[02:02:17.823 --> 02:02:18.363]  Absolutely.
[02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:24.732]  All right, folks, we'll be right back, and we'll take more of your calls, but I want to get into the violence.
[02:02:24.912 --> 02:02:32.701]  You know, the men and men have held back, even when they've been assaulted, but we've got mass murder going on everywhere here.
[02:02:35.481 --> 02:02:38.343]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:38.604 --> 02:02:39.304]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:39.384 --> 02:02:40.185]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:40.525 --> 02:02:45.189]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:45.529 --> 02:02:52.275]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:02:52.595 --> 02:02:54.577]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:02:54.777 --> 02:02:57.619]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:02.384]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:02.584 --> 02:03:06.988]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:07.228 --> 02:03:14.454]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:14.714 --> 02:03:17.136]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:17.296 --> 02:03:19.018]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:35.248 --> 02:03:38.252]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:38.593 --> 02:03:47.424]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:47.745 --> 02:03:52.431]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:03:52.891 --> 02:03:59.615]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:03:59.996 --> 02:04:11.783]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:12.263 --> 02:04:16.728]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:16.888 --> 02:04:19.350]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:34.949 --> 02:04:37.291]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:37.531 --> 02:04:39.573]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:39.713 --> 02:04:46.760]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:55.588]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:05:22.934 --> 02:05:25.316]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:05:35.521 --> 02:05:41.543]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:42.163 --> 02:05:45.184]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:45.784 --> 02:06:00.708]  In the last 30 minutes of the broadcast, I'm going to get back into what's happening in China, this poor lady being arrested, all the media spin surrounding that, play the audio clip of what she actually said, also play a clip where Bush had me arrested for asking a question at the end of his speech at a scheduled press conference they canceled.
[02:06:01.736 --> 02:06:04.718]  Many years ago, so we'll be playing those clips, so stay with us for that.
[02:06:05.218 --> 02:06:11.261]  Al Garza is the National Director of the Minutemen Project, and it's MinutemenHQ.com.
[02:06:11.281 --> 02:06:14.163]  We have a link to it up on Infowars.com.
[02:06:14.183 --> 02:06:19.086]  We're about to go right back to these loaded phone lines, Sean Malta, Paul BL, and others.
[02:06:20.166 --> 02:06:24.789]  But, sir, you're from South Texas, you live in Arizona, I'm from Central Texas.
[02:06:25.484 --> 02:06:31.971]  Three times last year, and it's still in effect, they put out a State Department warning about Laredo, Laredo on the Texas side.
[02:06:32.011 --> 02:06:35.034]  It's really one city with a river in between it, for those that don't know.
[02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:38.658]  I went down there as a kid with my parents to sightsee.
[02:06:38.979 --> 02:06:43.804]  I went down there as a college student to drink tequila, which I don't do now, folks, but most of us have done it.
[02:06:44.605 --> 02:06:46.246]  And have a great time.
[02:06:46.687 --> 02:06:48.129]  It's a huge ghost town now.
[02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:50.812]  The people are begging for the tourists to come back.
[02:06:51.152 --> 02:06:53.094]  800 dead on our side and their side last year.
[02:06:53.234 --> 02:06:54.095]  800 and something dead.
[02:06:54.556 --> 02:06:55.297]  Rocket attacks.
[02:06:55.317 --> 02:06:57.519]  50 plus Americans captured at one pop.
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:06:59.842]  Car bombs going off in Dallas.
[02:06:59.882 --> 02:07:00.943]  Machine gunning deaths.
[02:07:01.383 --> 02:07:02.825]  Los Zetas, which is the CIA...
[02:07:04.086 --> 02:07:04.466]  We're good to go.
[02:07:04.486 --> 02:07:05.046]  We're good to go.
[02:07:05.086 --> 02:07:05.667]  We're good to go.
[02:07:29.754 --> 02:07:39.561]  I mean, it's a huge secret that the State Department said areas of south Texas and southern Arizona are more dangerous per capita than Israel's West Bank.
[02:07:39.661 --> 02:07:40.662]  Al Garza comments.
[02:07:41.242 --> 02:07:42.163]  Well, that's correct.
[02:07:42.623 --> 02:07:44.925]  And thus, the Minutemen and also...
[02:07:45.467 --> 02:07:53.250]  We have been declaring that we are virtually at war, that we should in fact engage and deploy our military out to the borders.
[02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:59.333]  You do that, you will seize all these crimes and all these pathetic drug cartels that want to do what they want to do.
[02:07:59.593 --> 02:08:07.936]  I've heard special forces colonels and others say that if you put 10,000 regular troops on the 2,000 mile southern border, it is over.
[02:08:08.157 --> 02:08:13.619]  But they can put out sensors, they can stop every single person trying to come across.
[02:08:14.199 --> 02:08:15.000]  That's affirmative.
[02:08:15.380 --> 02:08:22.047]  And the reason they haven't done it again is chiefly because it's not economically practical for the politicians.
[02:08:22.937 --> 02:08:23.558]  On the two sides.
[02:08:23.618 --> 02:08:30.242]  The Democrats won in the votes, and obviously the Republicans won in the cheap labor.
[02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:32.423]  So it's right back to the same root.
[02:08:32.963 --> 02:08:34.844]  Labor, cheap labor, and votes.
[02:08:35.185 --> 02:08:45.271]  Well, for those that don't know, forest agents, FBI, DEA, their informants, sheriff's deputies have been killed almost on a monthly basis now in the last few years, and it's kept very quiet.
[02:08:45.611 --> 02:08:47.172]  Imagine if Al-Qaeda terrorists...
[02:08:47.572 --> 02:08:48.092]  We're good to go.
[02:08:48.132 --> 02:08:48.552]  We're good to go.
[02:09:17.423 --> 02:09:19.764]  Yeah, if you do that a couple of times, they'll stop.
[02:09:19.804 --> 02:09:24.646]  See, the reason they keep doing it and pursuing the same old pattern is because we're not responding.
[02:09:25.026 --> 02:09:26.107]  We're letting them get away with it.
[02:09:26.147 --> 02:09:31.089]  But you respond out there with the military or even us old-timers that have been combat-ready for years.
[02:09:31.409 --> 02:09:32.129]  We'll go out there.
[02:09:32.529 --> 02:09:38.052]  If we are licensed to go out there, if we become authorized, we're not going to break the law, but we'll certainly put a stop to it.
[02:09:38.072 --> 02:09:40.493]  Well, you could be deputized by the governor right now.
[02:09:40.813 --> 02:09:45.355]  Absolutely, but they refuse to do it because it's not economically practical.
[02:09:46.150 --> 02:09:57.038]  Well, I want to go to calls, but two things that you made me think of when you just talked about that is that Rick Perry said, oh, I'm going to put 100 people in the next year on the border, and it's a few state guard, a few national guard, a few state police.
[02:09:57.458 --> 02:10:02.562]  On average, 10 on duty per day at any one time in these shifts.
[02:10:02.962 --> 02:10:05.704]  Ten people on the Texas border is an absolute joke.
[02:10:06.264 --> 02:10:09.245]  He simply did that and had a big PR conference with Bush.
[02:10:09.645 --> 02:10:12.485]  Now, again, the 1,000 people getting arrested, that is .00004.
[02:10:12.685 --> 02:10:18.407]  If they did 1,000 a day for the next year, it would be less than 1% of the illegal aliens.
[02:10:18.727 --> 02:10:22.828]  This is an absolute joke, but it shows they're having to at least respond on the surface.
[02:10:23.308 --> 02:10:26.688]  Yeah, they've got no choice now but to continue addressing it because we're not going to let up.
[02:10:26.708 --> 02:10:33.850]  We've made it publicly known that the Minuteman will not secure until we are relieved of our duties by the military,
[02:10:34.792 --> 02:10:41.619]  The Border Patrol, a combination of both, including fences, technology, whatever it takes, we will not leave.
[02:10:41.719 --> 02:10:45.863]  We are going to be the 800-pound gorilla there daily, pounding on their table.
[02:10:46.103 --> 02:10:56.273]  Well, I've read the Constitution, I've read the state constitutions, and what, six years ago, seven years ago, when Clinton allowed the feds to have controlled burns that then burned down a bunch of states.
[02:10:56.893 --> 02:11:01.616]  The sheriff said, we're declaring our own emergencies, kicking the feds out and deputizing citizenry.
[02:11:02.037 --> 02:11:17.527]  Right now, those sheriffs could deputize you and give you the funding and put you guys out there with .50 caliber rifles to simply return fire and protect the deputies when Mexican troops shoot at you guys on a routine basis.
[02:11:17.988 --> 02:11:21.050]  Would you like to see the sheriff start deputizing you guys?
[02:11:21.330 --> 02:11:21.930]  Absolutely.
[02:11:22.091 --> 02:11:24.032]  I'll tell you what, we would take joy in it.
[02:11:24.548 --> 02:11:40.386]  The problem we're having as Minutemen is that we've got to watch our P's and Q's because we've got not only the politicians constantly breathing down our throats, we've got the ACLU breathing right on us, monitoring every move that we make so we can't do anything out of the ordinary, not that we're going to,
[02:11:40.987 --> 02:11:49.593]  But that makes it very uncomfortable because they've got the right to spy on us and monitor us, but we don't have the right to monitor illegal entries.
[02:11:49.613 --> 02:11:53.755]  Well, I've seen case after case of men and others getting shot at.
[02:11:54.076 --> 02:11:55.817]  And it happens in the Huachuca.
[02:11:55.877 --> 02:11:57.278]  Not long ago, we got fired upon.
[02:11:58.198 --> 02:12:00.980]  The Whetstones, not far from where I live, we got fired upon.
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.702]  Over in the Nahuatl line, we got fired upon.
[02:12:04.198 --> 02:12:08.425]  The three points in Arizona by Tucson we got fired upon.
[02:12:08.445 --> 02:12:09.827]  These people mean business.
[02:12:10.348 --> 02:12:13.913]  Now, if you were authorized by the sheriff, you guys could return fire.
[02:12:14.234 --> 02:12:15.736]  If we return fire, you bet.
[02:12:15.796 --> 02:12:17.479]  They would stop just like a doornail.
[02:12:18.427 --> 02:12:21.968]  But we just don't have the right unless our lives are at stake.
[02:12:22.008 --> 02:12:30.771]  And at this point in time, again, we're very reluctant to do anything out of the ordinary because we initially started this thing and engaged it chiefly to bring awareness.
[02:12:30.811 --> 02:12:31.691]  And we've done that very well.
[02:12:31.711 --> 02:12:38.794]  You had unbelievable restraint and showed incredible fortitude and stoic repose.
[02:12:39.094 --> 02:12:39.594]  That's right.
[02:12:39.914 --> 02:12:40.754]  And we bite our tongue.
[02:12:40.794 --> 02:12:44.075]  Me as a Marine is obviously as loyal I am to this country.
[02:12:44.135 --> 02:12:45.396]  I bite my tongue every time I...
[02:12:46.136 --> 02:12:48.838]  I engage, for example, the ACLU or La Raza.
[02:12:49.218 --> 02:12:50.379]  I've got to bite my tongue.
[02:12:50.459 --> 02:12:52.260]  Otherwise, I would say things I shouldn't say.
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:54.542]  I understand.
[02:12:55.062 --> 02:12:59.505]  But we're going to have the final victory against this, and they can't cover up all the people their troops are killing.
[02:13:00.005 --> 02:13:00.886]  It's starting to come out.
[02:13:01.166 --> 02:13:04.228]  How long ago was that that you guys had all the burnings, all the arson?
[02:13:04.949 --> 02:13:08.571]  That was, this is 2006.
[02:13:08.671 --> 02:13:10.092]  I think it was last year.
[02:13:10.673 --> 02:13:11.373]  Yeah, last year.
[02:13:11.873 --> 02:13:15.135]  I believe it was, what, 13 houses and cars got burned in one night?
[02:13:15.276 --> 02:13:15.716]  That's right.
[02:13:16.354 --> 02:13:16.794]  That's right.
[02:13:17.415 --> 02:13:17.975]  And you know what?
[02:13:18.115 --> 02:13:24.961]  It's been going on before, but again, the news, the media wasn't covering that kind of thing because it just wasn't the appropriate thing to do.
[02:13:25.521 --> 02:13:26.642]  Now they've got no choice.
[02:13:26.722 --> 02:13:30.585]  Even when I get interviewed, sometimes and oftentimes they'll misquote me.
[02:13:31.726 --> 02:13:33.107]  They're still very reluctant.
[02:13:33.167 --> 02:13:35.889]  I have a feeling the drug cartels are really the ones behind all this.
[02:13:37.052 --> 02:13:37.933]  Oh, we know they are.
[02:13:38.973 --> 02:13:44.876]  Celica Stillo, former chief DEA agent in Latin America, said that on this broadcast, and he's from the same area as you in South Texas.
[02:13:45.436 --> 02:13:47.357]  Same story, you know, great patriot family.
[02:13:47.997 --> 02:13:50.038]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:13:50.458 --> 02:13:52.499]  Let's talk to Sean in New Hampshire.
[02:13:52.519 --> 02:13:53.120]  Go ahead, Sean.
[02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:54.280]  Hi, Alex.
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:55.501]  Great to be on with you again.
[02:13:56.661 --> 02:14:05.085]  I'm moving to Arizona next month, and I certainly plan to stand with Al and be a Minuteman volunteer as well.
[02:14:05.346 --> 02:14:06.006]  That'd be wonderful.
[02:14:07.216 --> 02:14:09.577]  And I also want to speak to a point.
[02:14:09.597 --> 02:14:30.547]  There's a lot of professional people who, like myself, who are engineers, etc., who listen to your show, Alex, and I want to implore them to participate, to volunteer, to get the word out, because our rights, our way of life, your paycheck is at stake here.
[02:14:30.607 --> 02:14:33.708]  Yeah, we're under military and economic and cultural assault.
[02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:49.731]  And I'll tell you, I talk to my friends, they're mad as hell about it, and the thing of it is, is people have to get to the point of taking action, and we've got to take action, we've got to stand up for our rights, because no one else is going to do it for you.
[02:14:50.011 --> 02:14:52.513]  The elected politicians, they're bought and paid for.
[02:14:52.533 --> 02:14:54.514]  Well, I agree with you, Al.
[02:14:54.534 --> 02:15:00.879]  There's been a lot of bravado and arrogance, whatever you want to call it, machismo, you know...
[02:15:02.162 --> 02:15:03.804]  Well, it has been talked.
[02:15:03.884 --> 02:15:05.566]  At first they thought they were going to...
[02:15:13.945 --> 02:15:15.585]  Kind of blow us away and frighten us.
[02:15:15.605 --> 02:15:19.186]  Well, I sent them a very strong message, even the Bomberay.
[02:15:19.907 --> 02:15:23.087]  You know, if they want to toe-to-toe, let's do it the right way, we'll toe-to-toe.
[02:15:24.128 --> 02:15:25.148]  We're not going to break laws.
[02:15:25.248 --> 02:15:26.988]  If anybody's going to break laws, it's going to be them.
[02:15:27.008 --> 02:15:27.828]  But we're not frightened.
[02:15:27.929 --> 02:15:30.429]  We know what their plan has been.
[02:15:30.789 --> 02:15:37.411]  They've had a very well-planned, and by the way, they have executed their agenda quite properly, but we're on to them.
[02:15:37.851 --> 02:15:38.831]  And that's what they didn't want.
[02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:41.652]  And again, the Minutemen, I feel, are responsible for that.
[02:15:43.041 --> 02:15:43.701]  We exposed them.
[02:15:44.041 --> 02:15:44.521]  I agree with you.
[02:15:44.541 --> 02:15:46.682]  Thanks for the call, and I'm glad you're going to Arizona.
[02:15:46.702 --> 02:15:47.562]  That's very exciting.
[02:15:48.262 --> 02:15:51.443]  Let's go ahead and talk to Malta and Denmark, and then Paul and BL.
[02:15:52.063 --> 02:15:52.784]  Malta, go ahead.
[02:15:53.424 --> 02:15:54.204]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[02:15:54.464 --> 02:15:54.744]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:54.824 --> 02:15:56.825]  It's very sad what happened in America.
[02:15:58.165 --> 02:15:59.345]  I've seen the same here.
[02:16:00.366 --> 02:16:04.907]  The police are doing nothing if you go to them with any one of these...
[02:16:06.677 --> 02:16:08.699]  I'm not sure they are legal or legal, man.
[02:16:09.119 --> 02:16:10.320]  That's right.
[02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:13.102]  You're getting overrun by Eastern Europeans, Arabs, and others.
[02:16:13.162 --> 02:16:15.904]  No, Eastern Europeans is mafia, I think.
[02:16:16.264 --> 02:16:17.205]  Many of them, at least.
[02:16:17.445 --> 02:16:19.467]  But they're burning your cities down.
[02:16:20.187 --> 02:16:23.310]  Yeah, but some places I will never visit.
[02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:31.816]  There's actually something in the Constitution that says illegal aliens have no rights, but they don't use it.
[02:16:34.925 --> 02:16:37.487]  I mean, Al, it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:16:38.488 --> 02:16:39.288]  Exactly right.
[02:16:39.548 --> 02:16:42.630]  Again, when we address illegal immigration, we use the umbrella.
[02:16:42.650 --> 02:16:51.997]  We're not saying specifically one nation or... It's unfortunate, and it's a fact that Mexico has obviously probably 90% of the illegals coming through.
[02:16:52.077 --> 02:16:52.937]  It's the worst offender.
[02:16:52.997 --> 02:16:54.498]  Yeah, it's the worst offender, absolutely.
[02:16:54.898 --> 02:16:57.260]  But other countries do exist.
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:01.583]  People of interest, people who want to hurt us, are in fact coming through the borders.
[02:17:02.336 --> 02:17:03.537]  And he's right.
[02:17:03.597 --> 02:17:05.498]  A lot of people don't understand the Constitution.
[02:17:05.558 --> 02:17:07.880]  And there are some real terrorists out there.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:09.421]  You better believe it.
[02:17:09.441 --> 02:17:16.725]  I mean, we just caught this Chinese guy trying to sell 2,000 shoulder-launched missiles that can take down Boeing jumbo jets.
[02:17:16.825 --> 02:17:18.847]  Al, do one more segment with us so we can take some more calls.
[02:17:18.987 --> 02:17:19.547]  You got it, pal.
[02:17:19.707 --> 02:17:21.649]  We'll come back and give out the website as well.
[02:17:22.009 --> 02:17:22.409]  Stay with us.
[02:17:22.429 --> 02:17:23.490]  Thank you, Mulder from Denmark.
[02:17:23.510 --> 02:17:23.970]  Great call.
[02:17:24.571 --> 02:17:25.271]  All right.
[02:17:25.711 --> 02:17:26.332]  Other callers?
[02:17:26.592 --> 02:17:27.432]  Paul, BL, others?
[02:17:27.452 --> 02:17:29.734]  We'll get to you on the other side after this quick break.
[02:17:34.369 --> 02:17:36.391]  Gee, honey, your feet look great in those sandals.
[02:17:36.531 --> 02:17:36.871]  Thanks.
[02:17:37.131 --> 02:17:39.393]  Last summer, I was too embarrassed by my nails to wear them.
[02:17:39.493 --> 02:17:41.534]  Well, your toenails sure look clear and healthy now.
[02:17:41.634 --> 02:17:43.015]  Makes me feel terrible about mine.
[02:17:43.076 --> 02:17:44.016]  See, this one looks thick.
[02:17:44.076 --> 02:17:44.917]  That one's yellow.
[02:17:44.997 --> 02:17:46.858]  What you need is Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:17:46.978 --> 02:17:50.121]  Nonex clears out the buildup that discolors toenails and fingernails.
[02:17:50.141 --> 02:17:51.562]  It's called keratin debris.
[02:17:51.702 --> 02:17:52.963]  Just apply Nonex daily.
[02:17:53.043 --> 02:17:55.104]  And I'll have clear, healthy-looking toenails?
[02:17:55.325 --> 02:17:56.145]  Just look at mine.
[02:17:56.285 --> 02:17:58.747]  The Dietrist Recommended Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:17:58.927 --> 02:18:03.791]  Now at Walgreens, Longs, Eckerd Pharmacy, Rite Aid, and Brooks Pharmacy in the foot care section.
[02:18:05.729 --> 02:18:06.750]  Looking for profits?
[02:18:06.810 --> 02:18:08.190]  Looking for safety and security?
[02:18:08.531 --> 02:18:11.372]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[02:18:11.772 --> 02:18:19.356]  This low-vintage collector coin, with a total series vintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[02:18:19.416 --> 02:18:22.958]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[02:18:23.178 --> 02:18:24.679]  Secure your position today.
[02:18:24.999 --> 02:18:26.200]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:26.500]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:40.119 --> 02:18:43.385]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:18:44.126 --> 02:18:45.469]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[02:18:48.487 --> 02:18:53.969]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:54.369 --> 02:18:57.490]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:59.590]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:59.650 --> 02:19:02.691]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:03.371 --> 02:19:05.452]  Here is reality.
[02:19:05.812 --> 02:19:09.373]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:09.873 --> 02:19:13.494]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:36.369 --> 02:19:37.922]  We're good to go.
[02:19:42.094 --> 02:19:51.156]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:19:51.416 --> 02:20:02.639]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:20:02.979 --> 02:20:08.680]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:20:08.920 --> 02:20:09.881]  We're good to go.
[02:20:23.857 --> 02:20:26.238]  If you had to flee your home in three minutes, what would you bring?
[02:20:26.258 --> 02:20:30.741]  Wouldn't it be nice if you had all of your important items in one place and ready to grab just in case you had to leave quickly in an emergency?
[02:20:55.866 --> 02:21:01.109]  Guardian Angel Preparedness specializes in survival products and 72-hour survival kits.
[02:21:01.549 --> 02:21:07.813]  Our kits contain only the finest quality survival supplies, hand-selected to be of real value in an emergency.
[02:21:08.213 --> 02:21:11.155]  We have kits for one, two, four people or more.
[02:21:11.615 --> 02:21:18.679]  We also carry emergency lighting, tools, and even survival supplies for your dog, like saddlebags and collapsible food and water bowls.
[02:21:19.279 --> 02:21:20.820]  Contact us toll-free at 877-442-7548.
[02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:21.120]  That's 877-442-7548.
[02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:22.281]  Or visit www.gapkids.com.
[02:21:22.301 --> 02:21:23.241]  That's www.gapkids.com.
[02:21:44.901 --> 02:21:56.204]  Al Garza, National Director of the Minute Minute Project, is our guest, Marine Corps Vietnam veteran, great American patriot, in the footsteps of Paul Revere, and the great men at the Alamo.
[02:21:57.264 --> 02:21:59.704]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[02:21:59.904 --> 02:22:01.645]  Paul in Atlanta and BL and others.
[02:22:01.685 --> 02:22:02.505]  Paul, you're on the air.
[02:22:02.545 --> 02:22:02.965]  Go ahead.
[02:22:03.605 --> 02:22:04.125]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:04.185 --> 02:22:05.346]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:22:05.366 --> 02:22:10.286]  I just want to tell you I am a PrisonPlanet.com subscriber.
[02:22:10.947 --> 02:22:12.607]  I am a former National Guardsman
[02:22:13.374 --> 02:22:21.557]  I served during the Desert Storm and I got to tell you I'm also an immigrant and I completely disagree with everything you and Al Garza here are talking about here.
[02:22:21.577 --> 02:22:28.120]  I think you guys are talking about attacking this problem at the surface and not at the deeper level.
[02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:30.420]  Sealing the borders is not going to do a thing.
[02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:35.062]  You're talking about just doing something superficial.
[02:22:35.142 --> 02:22:37.503]  It's not going to stop the drug inflow.
[02:22:37.563 --> 02:22:41.284]  It's not going to stop violence in Texas or Arizona or New Mexico or anything.
[02:22:43.164 --> 02:22:44.124]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:22:44.144 --> 02:22:51.766]  Do you believe me, or have you checked out the head of Chicano Studies saying now all whites must die and the killing needs to start soon?
[02:22:51.786 --> 02:22:53.107]  I have, Alex.
[02:22:53.207 --> 02:22:53.587]  I have.
[02:22:53.687 --> 02:22:55.267]  And look, like I told you, I'm an immigrant.
[02:22:55.287 --> 02:22:56.448]  I came from Argentina.
[02:22:56.588 --> 02:22:59.288]  But I'm asking you, sir, we're not supposed to get upset about that.
[02:23:01.269 --> 02:23:02.769]  I'm not saying you're not supposed to get upset about it.
[02:23:02.789 --> 02:23:03.890]  Because I'm not laying down, buddy.
[02:23:03.930 --> 02:23:04.650]  I'm not laying down.
[02:23:05.010 --> 02:23:06.330]  Who told you to lie down, Alex?
[02:23:06.370 --> 02:23:09.931]  I'm telling you that you're attacking the problem at the wrong end.
[02:23:10.371 --> 02:23:12.132]  If you want to talk about sealing borders...
[02:23:12.526 --> 02:23:18.954]  Why don't you go and seal a border around Walmart or Nike or these companies that set up sweatshops down in Guatemala?
[02:23:19.054 --> 02:23:21.136]  I spent the first hour on that.
[02:23:21.397 --> 02:23:22.838]  I absolutely agree with you, sir.
[02:23:22.858 --> 02:23:26.463]  I mean, they pay these people five cents an hour to make shoes.
[02:23:28.345 --> 02:23:29.326]  What kind of future is that?
[02:23:29.366 --> 02:23:30.708]  Well, I've got the answer for you.
[02:23:31.488 --> 02:23:32.610]  I've got the answer for you, Paul.
[02:23:32.650 --> 02:23:34.012]  We are addressing that as we speak.
[02:23:34.032 --> 02:23:38.018]  As a matter of fact, we launched an operation we call Operation Spotlight.
[02:23:38.499 --> 02:23:40.542]  It's as old as probably a little over a year now.
[02:23:40.943 --> 02:23:45.270]  We are addressing corporations, as you were just mentioning, different factories.
[02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:46.432]  That has been part of the plan.
[02:23:47.012 --> 02:23:49.694]  You can't talk about sealing the borders without, you know, talking about, you know...
[02:24:13.747 --> 02:24:22.354]  attacking these companies, our biggest export in America is poverty to South America and to Central America through NAFTA, through gas.
[02:24:22.634 --> 02:24:25.616]  They create these economies that just exploit these people.
[02:24:25.656 --> 02:24:27.678]  Paul, let me say something to you.
[02:24:28.365 --> 02:24:32.487]  Do you understand the same people that like NAFTA and GATT are the ones that like the open borders?
[02:24:32.507 --> 02:24:43.831]  It is the jewel in their crown to not have borders and have a Pan-American Union, a Union of American States, and that's what's going on, and you can just keep saying it won't help.
[02:24:44.231 --> 02:24:47.132]  No, they're fighting tooth and nail to stop us from doing this, sir.
[02:24:47.152 --> 02:24:53.335]  This nationalism, this idea that we've got to have these safe borders,
[02:24:53.866 --> 02:24:55.108]  It's not going to end anything.
[02:24:55.128 --> 02:24:56.049]  Yes, it is.
[02:24:56.170 --> 02:24:58.813]  Sir, the globalists want open borders.
[02:24:59.374 --> 02:25:08.047]  Okay, so the very people that love the Nike slaves and that love President Who are the very ones that love what you're saying, man.
[02:25:08.067 --> 02:25:09.149]  Can't you figure that out?
[02:25:09.767 --> 02:25:11.109]  I'm trying to figure it out, Alex.
[02:25:11.129 --> 02:25:20.919]  What I'm trying to make heads or tails out of is why you guys are sitting here proposing, you know, violence against violence, talk about shooting at the borders, talk about an open war.
[02:25:21.259 --> 02:25:23.281]  You're talking about... Sure, sure.
[02:25:23.301 --> 02:25:24.342]  Wait a minute, I'll hold.
[02:25:24.362 --> 02:25:24.442]  Sure.
[02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:28.731]  We're being killed, okay?
[02:25:28.771 --> 02:25:30.532]  The police are being killed.
[02:25:31.032 --> 02:25:32.373]  People are being kidnapped.
[02:25:32.513 --> 02:25:33.454]  Rocket attacks.
[02:25:33.554 --> 02:25:34.394]  Car bombs.
[02:25:34.834 --> 02:25:39.457]  I'm saying if foreign military attacks America, we should shoot back.
[02:25:39.937 --> 02:25:40.558]  Al Garza.
[02:25:41.118 --> 02:25:42.239]  Well, that's correct.
[02:25:42.899 --> 02:25:47.381]  To sit back and just go along with the ride would not be the appropriate thing to do for America.
[02:25:48.242 --> 02:25:51.944]  You know, I share in his concerns, but it's obvious that we've got no other choices.
[02:25:53.179 --> 02:25:56.881]  Our options are minimal now, and the only obvious thing to do is into the Pacific.
[02:25:57.181 --> 02:26:00.844]  You're talking about the Laredo and the Rio areas.
[02:26:00.904 --> 02:26:02.005]  They're very dangerous.
[02:26:03.146 --> 02:26:04.126]  New Mexico as well.
[02:26:05.127 --> 02:26:10.050]  If you put your military out there and they play games with the military, we would return fire.
[02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:12.152]  And once you do that, you seize it.
[02:26:12.762 --> 02:26:19.566]  But we're not going to lay down, as Alex is saying, lay down on the mere fact that the guys are saying, well, you know, we shouldn't be doing that because that's war.
[02:26:19.606 --> 02:26:21.147]  Well, it is war.
[02:26:21.247 --> 02:26:22.288]  We are being invaded.
[02:26:22.428 --> 02:26:28.972]  When you're talking about millions of people penetrating our borders, completely unannounced, it's nothing less to me than an invasion.
[02:26:30.193 --> 02:26:31.934]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:26:32.335 --> 02:26:36.077]  You cannot talk about, you know, a police state coming down on America...
[02:26:36.536 --> 02:26:41.924]  Talking about surveillance, talking about how they're watching us, and then play right into their hands by going out and having open warfare.
[02:26:41.964 --> 02:26:43.366]  Sure, they don't want trips.
[02:26:43.386 --> 02:26:44.767]  Hey, don't worry.
[02:26:44.788 --> 02:26:47.992]  Bush isn't going to put trips on it, and Hillary won't put trips on it.
[02:26:48.673 --> 02:26:49.294]  Do you understand?
[02:26:49.314 --> 02:26:50.556]  America is dying.
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:53.820]  It is not a police state to control your border.
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:56.061]  That's where the military and police are supposed to be.
[02:26:56.381 --> 02:26:56.901]  That's correct.
[02:26:57.181 --> 02:27:04.122]  Listen, I get pulled over in the middle of the country in Kansas, and they want to search my car, and they say, for homeland security, but they won't go do it on the border.
[02:27:04.142 --> 02:27:07.323]  You know, Al, I meant to let you go now, but do five more minutes on the other shots.
[02:27:07.343 --> 02:27:08.283]  I'd be happy to, Alex.
[02:27:08.583 --> 02:27:08.863]  Okay.
[02:27:09.123 --> 02:27:10.604]  Paul, you want to stay there so you can finish up?
[02:27:11.084 --> 02:27:11.304]  Sure.
[02:27:11.644 --> 02:27:13.044]  I mean, Paul, I think you're emotional.
[02:27:13.084 --> 02:27:13.884]  You're not listening.
[02:27:14.605 --> 02:27:17.005]  People have said they plan to kill me and my family.
[02:27:18.547 --> 02:27:19.368]  I'm not racist.
[02:27:19.548 --> 02:27:20.289]  They're racist.
[02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:22.391]  I'm going to stand up against them.
[02:27:24.794 --> 02:27:25.695]  We're on the march.
[02:27:26.175 --> 02:27:27.777]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:28.698 --> 02:27:31.401]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:35.194 --> 02:27:38.315]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[02:27:38.576 --> 02:27:45.379]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[02:27:45.819 --> 02:27:59.185]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[02:27:59.485 --> 02:28:03.227]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[02:28:03.581 --> 02:28:04.261]  We're good to go.
[02:28:04.281 --> 02:28:04.481]  I think?
[02:28:35.163 --> 02:28:38.164]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:38.504 --> 02:28:47.327]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:47.647 --> 02:28:52.329]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:28:52.789 --> 02:28:59.517]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:28:59.918 --> 02:29:11.712]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:12.172 --> 02:29:16.637]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:16.798 --> 02:29:19.621]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:19.641 --> 02:29:21.643]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:21.683 --> 02:29:22.324]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:22.404 --> 02:29:23.866]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:23.886 --> 02:29:24.947]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:34.170 --> 02:29:38.615]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:29:38.895 --> 02:29:42.499]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:29:42.639 --> 02:29:50.748]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:29:51.008 --> 02:29:56.650]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:29:56.951 --> 02:30:02.173]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:30:02.453 --> 02:30:04.534]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[02:30:04.794 --> 02:30:16.939]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:30:17.179 --> 02:30:21.600]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:22.761]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:22.941 --> 02:30:24.581]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:30:24.701 --> 02:30:25.502]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:30:25.522 --> 02:30:25.802]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:30:25.842 --> 02:30:26.122]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:30:26.142 --> 02:30:26.942]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:26.982 --> 02:30:27.802]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:27.822 --> 02:30:28.382]  Al Garnesville
[02:30:48.152 --> 02:30:53.417]  Who was shot at in Vietnam as a Marine Corps member of the Marine Corps.
[02:30:54.318 --> 02:31:07.250]  Just told you earlier in the last hour that he's been shot at repeatedly, out peacefully on the border, videotaping the hordes of illegals pouring across from every nation you can imagine and simply calling the Border Patrol.
[02:31:07.771 --> 02:31:11.634]  The Border Patrol for five years has had a $200,000 bounty on their head.
[02:31:11.895 --> 02:31:13.196]  They get killed every year.
[02:31:14.184 --> 02:31:18.448]  Their cars are shot up by armored vehicles firing .50 calibers.
[02:31:19.048 --> 02:31:28.177]  And then we say that we should put the military down there to return fire when we're fired on by a foreign country, and the answer is we're evil, wanting to use weapons.
[02:31:29.077 --> 02:31:38.506]  If somebody comes to my house and is busting down the door to kill me and my family, I'm going to go in the instant access pistol safe, I'm going to pull out my handgun, and I'm going to deal with it.
[02:31:38.526 --> 02:31:40.668]  That's a normal, natural, decent...
[02:31:41.843 --> 02:31:43.345]  Fatherly response.
[02:31:43.405 --> 02:31:44.405]  That's normal.
[02:31:45.186 --> 02:31:46.187]  I'm not gelded.
[02:31:46.387 --> 02:31:47.628]  I haven't been castrated.
[02:31:48.488 --> 02:31:52.071]  And I don't know what to say.
[02:31:52.731 --> 02:31:55.653]  The Minutemen have been so controlled, they don't even return fire.
[02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:56.274]  This has been in the news.
[02:31:56.294 --> 02:32:05.600]  They sit there with total self-control, letting foreign troops and drug dealers shoot at them, and then Paul calls in going, I'm an immigrant, so basically I'm with the immigrants.
[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.621]  Let me tell you something.
[02:32:07.481 --> 02:32:11.784]  Bush hired a big fancy PR firm for his gubernatorial run, his presidential run.
[02:32:12.245 --> 02:32:13.866]  Fox used him for his presidential run.
[02:32:13.886 --> 02:32:16.708]  They're based up in Dallas, which is the Dallas Morning News.
[02:32:17.388 --> 02:32:18.609]  They staged all of this.
[02:32:18.849 --> 02:32:23.893]  Evil, controlling globalists are sacrificing America on the altar of globalism.
[02:32:24.713 --> 02:32:29.697]  It's about a new world order, as the head of the Border Patrol Union said a few years ago on this show.
[02:32:30.297 --> 02:32:32.279]  So go ahead and finish up what you have to say, Paul.
[02:32:32.839 --> 02:32:34.280]  Did that go in one ear and out the other?
[02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:36.802]  I never called you evil.
[02:32:37.339 --> 02:32:40.781]  I never said that you had evil intentions or anything like that.
[02:32:40.801 --> 02:32:45.363]  I just said that some of this violence against violence may be playing into their hands.
[02:32:45.863 --> 02:32:52.887]  I also said, not only am I an immigrant, but I'm also a veteran of the US Armed Forces as well.
[02:32:52.947 --> 02:32:54.247]  I fought for this country, Alex.
[02:32:54.707 --> 02:32:55.648]  I fought for this country.
[02:32:56.129 --> 02:32:57.490]  I believe in a lot of what you say.
[02:32:57.831 --> 02:32:59.793]  Like I said, I'm a PrisonPlanner.com subscriber.
[02:32:59.813 --> 02:33:00.413]  Well, thank you.
[02:33:00.834 --> 02:33:07.120]  So we've got to go fight with Saddam when he's done nothing, but then we've got to be running around letting our border be open being attacked.
[02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:14.547]  No, Alex, don't make this out to be, you know, that I'm trying to paint a double standard here.
[02:33:14.607 --> 02:33:15.428]  What I'm trying to say is,
[02:33:16.178 --> 02:33:19.980]  That a lot of these people are coming across the border actually seeking a better opportunity.
[02:33:20.380 --> 02:33:28.543]  You know, a future in Guatemala or Mexico means that your daughter or son, who's barely educated, gets to go work at a shoe factory for five cents an hour.
[02:33:28.623 --> 02:33:31.165]  Sure, I'm totally against it.
[02:33:31.365 --> 02:33:33.766]  You know, I support Chavez having sovereignty.
[02:33:34.046 --> 02:33:35.506]  Don't agree with some of his politics.
[02:33:35.947 --> 02:33:39.968]  I support the people of Mexico getting control of their country and not being slaves.
[02:33:40.048 --> 02:33:40.569]  Al Garza?
[02:33:41.109 --> 02:33:43.170]  Well, I agree with both of you.
[02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:45.631]  But, you know, again, you're talking about illegal immigration.
[02:33:45.951 --> 02:33:46.491]  We're good to go.
[02:34:00.749 --> 02:34:09.518]  All in all, you still need a port of entry, you need people signing in and signing out, and you also, at this point in time, you've got to seal the border regardless.
[02:34:09.558 --> 02:34:20.330]  You seal the border at all costs, whatever it takes, whether it be a fence, a combination of a fence, better technology, troops, border patrol, whatever, but you must seal the border.
[02:34:20.470 --> 02:34:23.233]  Otherwise, you will continue with this problem, and it will just get worse.
[02:34:23.803 --> 02:34:31.947]  Look, you put 100 aircraft down there, you put a couple thousand armored vehicles down there, 10,000 troops, and the problem's solved overnight.
[02:34:32.867 --> 02:34:34.308]  That's correct.
[02:34:34.728 --> 02:34:37.430]  I was in combat in Vietnam, as you already know, Alex.
[02:34:38.350 --> 02:34:42.432]  I served in the Marine Corps with the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, a very brave outfit.
[02:34:42.532 --> 02:34:46.134]  I was under good generals, good colonels, good leadership.
[02:34:46.554 --> 02:34:50.276]  I came out a sergeant from Vietnam, and I saw a battle every day.
[02:34:51.056 --> 02:34:51.636]  Not only that, 19...
[02:34:54.207 --> 02:34:57.188]  Very famous operations.
[02:34:57.908 --> 02:34:59.289]  So I know combat when I see it.
[02:35:00.009 --> 02:35:01.589]  This is definitely a war.
[02:35:02.009 --> 02:35:03.570]  Not only an invasion, it's a war.
[02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:06.671]  These people have declared war upon us, and Alex is right.
[02:35:06.711 --> 02:35:08.191]  You must defend your property.
[02:35:08.672 --> 02:35:11.492]  If you don't defend your property, then you've been castrated.
[02:35:12.293 --> 02:35:13.173]  But I'll tell you something.
[02:35:13.313 --> 02:35:16.774]  As Alex indicated earlier, you must defend your family.
[02:35:16.814 --> 02:35:20.375]  If you defend your family, you must also, and in particular, people that have been in the service.
[02:35:20.415 --> 02:35:22.576]  You yourself, Paul, took it off.
[02:35:23.208 --> 02:35:28.714]  To serve and protect American citizens, and by the sounds of what you're saying, you're not very interested in so doing.
[02:35:29.275 --> 02:35:30.036]  That's not true.
[02:35:30.056 --> 02:35:36.062]  I never said that I wasn't interested in serving my country, or my family, or anybody like that.
[02:35:36.103 --> 02:35:39.166]  What I am saying is that this violence is playing into the hands of
[02:35:40.998 --> 02:35:42.740]  And that's why they want more illegals here.
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:44.821]  That's why they want more here to get us all fighting with each other.
[02:35:44.881 --> 02:35:45.942]  Listen, listen, sir, let me ask you.
[02:35:46.303 --> 02:35:49.365]  The globalists want open borders, okay?
[02:35:49.405 --> 02:35:52.187]  And you say, you mention nationalism as if it's bad.
[02:35:52.588 --> 02:35:53.288]  Come on, man.
[02:35:53.508 --> 02:35:59.793]  The bad people, you know, the big bad bankers that are gutting this country are behind this little reconquista.
[02:36:00.654 --> 02:36:01.034]  That's right.
[02:36:01.835 --> 02:36:04.077]  Alex, it's not that nationalism is bad.
[02:36:04.097 --> 02:36:05.418]  It's not that patriotism is bad.
[02:36:05.802 --> 02:36:06.984]  It's just that it's misused.
[02:36:07.324 --> 02:36:10.349]  You know, there's a lot of broad brush strokes being painted here.
[02:36:11.811 --> 02:36:15.878]  One of the things that Al was talking about is 100% of these Mexicans that want to...
[02:36:16.417 --> 02:36:18.159]  Well, let me pose a question to you, Paul.
[02:36:18.179 --> 02:36:19.520]  Let me pose a question.
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:27.787]  If they've got the nuts to go out there and protest in a foreign land the way they've done so before, nonchalantly, and I thought that was very bold of them, very aggressive, why don't they do it in Mexico?
[02:36:27.827 --> 02:36:29.608]  Maybe things would change.
[02:36:44.980 --> 02:36:46.041]  They don't do it in Mexico.
[02:36:46.061 --> 02:36:46.621]  They'd be shot.
[02:36:46.681 --> 02:36:47.481]  They'd be persecuted.
[02:36:47.941 --> 02:36:48.822]  They do it in Mexico.
[02:36:48.842 --> 02:36:49.822]  They do it in Guatemala.
[02:36:49.842 --> 02:36:50.703]  They do it in Nicaragua.
[02:36:50.783 --> 02:36:51.963]  And yeah, they get shot at.
[02:36:52.123 --> 02:36:54.224]  Paul, I'm going to let you go because I'm just out of time.
[02:36:54.244 --> 02:36:57.066]  I've got to let Mr. Garza go after one more call because I've got some other news I've got to cover.
[02:36:57.306 --> 02:36:58.547]  Nice talking to you, Paul.
[02:36:58.567 --> 02:37:00.828]  Yeah, Paul, you can call me back tomorrow and we can debate this more.
[02:37:00.868 --> 02:37:01.628]  Please do, sir.
[02:37:01.668 --> 02:37:02.308]  I respect you.
[02:37:02.328 --> 02:37:03.869]  I think you reasonably are disagreeing.
[02:37:04.349 --> 02:37:07.091]  I don't think you're looking at the big picture here.
[02:37:07.471 --> 02:37:10.892]  And listen, I've been to these rallies, especially the first two weeks of them.
[02:37:10.972 --> 02:37:11.713]  We saw it on TV.
[02:37:12.771 --> 02:37:14.111]  I mean, what would you say, Al Garza?
[02:37:14.131 --> 02:37:22.333]  They'd have maybe 90 foreign flags, every American flag, and then later they served out more, and then on their own website snickered that it was to fool the gringo.
[02:37:24.094 --> 02:37:30.155]  Well, actually it was us, because at that point in time the radios were just going berserk, and the media was just going berserk.
[02:37:30.175 --> 02:37:30.995]  They were biting on this.
[02:37:31.435 --> 02:37:36.076]  And I personally did, I must have done about 25 shows all in a matter of hours.
[02:37:36.096 --> 02:37:39.497]  And obviously Chris was busy on the phone, Carmen Mercer was on the phone.
[02:37:39.537 --> 02:37:39.797]  When we...
[02:37:40.417 --> 02:37:41.878]  You can't unring that bell.
[02:37:41.918 --> 02:37:42.498]  One final call.
[02:37:42.518 --> 02:37:43.738]  Well, maybe two quickly.
[02:37:43.758 --> 02:37:43.838]  B.L.
[02:37:43.858 --> 02:37:44.458]  in Texas, quickly, go ahead.
[02:37:44.498 --> 02:37:44.638]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:44.678 --> 02:37:45.779]  I've got two things for Al Garza.
[02:37:45.799 --> 02:37:45.979]  Hello?
[02:37:45.999 --> 02:37:46.359]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:37:46.379 --> 02:37:46.839]  Hi, Al.
[02:38:08.459 --> 02:38:10.020]  Greatest respect for everything you're doing.
[02:38:10.681 --> 02:38:13.963]  My next-door neighbors are Mexicans from Mexico.
[02:38:14.324 --> 02:38:17.887]  They were amnestied back in the 90s.
[02:38:17.947 --> 02:38:27.174]  Now, they're decent, hard-working people, but four years ago, and I don't know how many times since, five Mexican soldiers showed up at their house and stayed two weeks.
[02:38:27.735 --> 02:38:37.983]  I know they were Mexican soldiers because they had bloused combat boots, high and tight white wall haircuts, and when I walked up behind them and shouted, They jumped to attention.
[02:38:38.869 --> 02:38:48.575]  How much coercion and threats of people that are here legally now do you think the Mexicans are putting on them to forward their agenda?
[02:38:48.976 --> 02:38:51.477]  Well, it's a very good question, and I've got an answer for you.
[02:38:51.958 --> 02:38:54.319]  Again, this is going back and it's dated back decades.
[02:38:54.339 --> 02:38:58.502]  You're talking about, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 years ongoing.
[02:38:58.902 --> 02:39:02.204]  People are coming into our country nonchalantly.
[02:39:02.224 --> 02:39:04.806]  Again, I like to use that word because that's what they do.
[02:39:05.603 --> 02:39:10.524]  They walk in here, and they rip us apart, and they move in, they buy a house, they buy cars.
[02:39:11.024 --> 02:39:11.804]  They're on welfare.
[02:39:11.844 --> 02:39:16.525]  A lot of them now, your next-door neighbor may or may not be, but most of them are.
[02:39:16.985 --> 02:39:17.625]  And you're right.
[02:39:17.745 --> 02:39:18.725]  They have people coming in.
[02:39:19.185 --> 02:39:25.047]  A lot of them are going to be part of the, what is it, the Beta Zeta, Zeta Beta, whatever they're called.
[02:39:25.087 --> 02:39:25.987]  Yeah, Los Zetas.
[02:39:26.047 --> 02:39:27.527]  Yeah, they're from that group.
[02:39:27.867 --> 02:39:32.768]  And specifically, retired military, people that are on the take in Mexico, they come in here, and they...
[02:39:34.429 --> 02:39:36.110]  They're drug dealer enforcers.
[02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:37.610]  That's even been in the Texas papers.
[02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:38.131]  Absolutely.
[02:39:38.151 --> 02:39:45.234]  And I sit in front of illegal aliens every day at the store next door, watching them pay for food and stuff with Lone Star cards.
[02:39:45.254 --> 02:39:47.196]  And that's the state welfare card, boys and girls.
[02:39:47.296 --> 02:39:48.036]  That's correct.
[02:39:48.516 --> 02:39:49.917]  Done all the time in Arizona, too.
[02:39:50.057 --> 02:39:51.738]  They can't speak English, but they're on welfare.
[02:39:52.358 --> 02:39:54.279]  Well, Al, that was four years ago.
[02:39:54.339 --> 02:39:56.260]  These people are still afraid to talk about it.
[02:39:57.281 --> 02:40:00.803]  Well, that doesn't surprise me, because they're probably... They've been targeted...
[02:40:01.682 --> 02:40:10.505]  As a special family to them that's going to cater to their needs, whatever those needs are, and they've got no other choice but to comply.
[02:40:11.805 --> 02:40:20.627]  It's just like the Chinese gangs have internal triad mafias now operating everywhere, and they feed on their own people.
[02:40:21.408 --> 02:40:22.308]  BL, I've got to let you go.
[02:40:22.328 --> 02:40:23.148]  Okay?
[02:40:23.428 --> 02:40:24.128]  Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.
[02:40:24.548 --> 02:40:26.249]  Chris in Kentucky, and then that's it.
[02:40:26.329 --> 02:40:26.949]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:40:27.549 --> 02:40:28.710]  Yes, I'll make it really quick.
[02:40:29.010 --> 02:40:29.970]  Last night on a...
[02:40:30.615 --> 02:40:40.408]  Radio Talk Show, somebody from the legislature of Kentucky was talking about the illegal problem, and they were talking about, well, I think it would be a good idea to have biometrics for everyone to condition them to get into the biometric system.
[02:40:40.928 --> 02:40:41.930]  And how far is this off?
[02:40:43.573 --> 02:40:44.514]  Well, no, that's what they do.
[02:40:44.534 --> 02:40:48.019]  They're going to track and control Americans, but then the illegals aren't going to have to do it, Al.
[02:40:49.220 --> 02:40:50.442]  Well, it's like everything else.
[02:40:50.522 --> 02:40:53.826]  Again, the rule of law is going to only apply to Americans.
[02:40:54.307 --> 02:41:02.517]  It's currently not applied to illegal aliens, and I don't think anything's going to change unless we continue pounding on them, and that's what we're going to continue doing.
[02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.770]  Anything else, Chris?
[02:41:04.151 --> 02:41:08.733]  Yeah, I just want to also say that the Thunder Over Loyola and the Derby festivities, it looks like we're going to have the military out here.
[02:41:08.773 --> 02:41:10.473]  They're going to have, like, checkpoints already.
[02:41:10.633 --> 02:41:11.994]  It's welcome to the New World Order.
[02:41:12.194 --> 02:41:19.437]  Yeah, we have urban warfare drills, and the military now marching around in Ohio and wherever else, quote, because of terrorism.
[02:41:20.018 --> 02:41:20.678]  Totally illegal.
[02:41:20.738 --> 02:41:22.099]  Violation of posse comitatus.
[02:41:22.519 --> 02:41:24.420]  And then, meanwhile, they won't put troops on the border.
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:29.322]  I just want to check the card and use Trimac, and, you know, make sure everybody's safe out here.
[02:41:30.268 --> 02:41:30.888]  All right, Chris.
[02:41:30.928 --> 02:41:31.529]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:31.589 --> 02:41:34.090]  Al Garza, give us the website one more time for the Minutemen project.
[02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.331]  All right.
[02:41:34.811 --> 02:41:35.331]  Minutemen.
[02:41:35.411 --> 02:41:35.972]  Single word.
[02:41:36.872 --> 02:41:37.913]  HQ.com.
[02:41:38.073 --> 02:41:39.554]  Anything and everything you need is there.
[02:41:39.834 --> 02:41:41.095]  MinutemenHQ.com.
[02:41:41.195 --> 02:41:42.255]  And what about a phone number?
[02:41:43.116 --> 02:41:46.538]  They can have mine.
[02:41:46.558 --> 02:41:47.939]  520-559-2520.
[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:52.242]  When are you going to be in Texas so I can have you in studio?
[02:41:52.502 --> 02:41:57.485]  I'm going to try to get up there next week, but I call you just before I make my plans.
[02:41:57.990 --> 02:42:01.432]  Because plans change daily, as you well know now.
[02:42:02.113 --> 02:42:04.214]  So I'm going to try to get there sometime next week.
[02:42:04.354 --> 02:42:08.017]  I don't know what day exactly, but I will call you prior to that, and then maybe we can set something up.
[02:42:08.117 --> 02:42:10.198]  Yeah, we've got a red carpet for you here at the office.
[02:42:10.218 --> 02:42:11.539]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:42:11.579 --> 02:42:12.920]  Thank you very much, my friend, Alex.
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:13.841]  You better take care.
[02:42:13.901 --> 02:42:16.823]  Al Garza, and that's the national director of the Minutemen Project.
[02:42:18.023 --> 02:42:18.644]  Unbelievable.
[02:42:20.385 --> 02:42:21.126]  I said I'd play this.
[02:42:21.146 --> 02:42:23.647]  Here's a two-minute clip of that poor lady being drug out.
[02:42:23.967 --> 02:42:27.610]  While Bush is talking about free speech, she brings up the tyranny.
[02:42:49.426 --> 02:43:00.352]  I have come to enhance dialogues, expand common ground, deepen mutual trust and cooperation, and promote the all-round growth of constructive and cooperative China-U.S.
[02:43:00.372 --> 02:43:02.073]  relations in the 21st century.
[02:43:02.093 --> 02:43:13.900]  The Chinese people have always had a friendly relationship with the American people.
[02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:14.080]  In 1784,
[02:43:20.317 --> 02:43:34.042]  The American merchant ship, the Queen of China, is sailing across the ocean to guard China.
[02:43:34.122 --> 02:43:40.024]  It has opened up two people's fates of friendship.
[02:43:40.084 --> 02:43:47.346]  In the mid-19th century, tens of thousands of Chinese workers and the American people
[02:43:49.324 --> 02:44:00.092]  As President Hu speaks, what you're seeing in the right side of your screen clearly is a protester.
[02:44:00.733 --> 02:44:02.874]  Don't know what she's saying, she's speaking in Chinese clearly.
[02:44:02.894 --> 02:44:16.985]  She's in the middle of the press corps there, and unclear what her protest is all about, whether it is something to do with human rights issues in China, but we're obviously going to continue to watch this as the talk continues.
[02:44:17.205 --> 02:44:20.409]  Clearly security making their way there right now.
[02:44:20.509 --> 02:44:34.386]  At one point she was saying when President Bush stopped him, we don't know what she was saying in Chinese, but as you mentioned, protests were there and some are taking heavy issue with human rights in China.
[02:44:36.056 --> 02:44:40.139]  Oh, there they are.
[02:44:40.259 --> 02:44:46.623]  Yes, there's uniformed Secret Service there now, squirting her away.
[02:44:46.703 --> 02:44:53.668]  Somehow, obviously got into the compound with a press credential of some kind in the middle of the press corps there.
[02:44:53.888 --> 02:44:55.949]  It took a while for them to get her.
[02:44:56.029 --> 02:45:03.054]  A surprising amount of time, but, you know, usually the press is kind of bottled up and put off in a corner and is not
[02:45:03.706 --> 02:45:08.847]  Yeah, well, it can be a pack, as you can see there.
[02:45:09.128 --> 02:45:13.429]  And kind of an embarrassing moment, potentially, for the president.
[02:45:13.529 --> 02:45:16.329]  I should say, amid the pomp and circumstance, a blemish.
[02:45:16.430 --> 02:45:17.950]  But let's continue to listen.
[02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:22.851]  Now, there was a CNN clip, but the link went dead.
[02:45:22.891 --> 02:45:25.372]  I guess people that had it posted, their servers crashed.
[02:45:26.667 --> 02:45:28.748]  In fact, I wish we had that clip.
[02:45:28.948 --> 02:45:34.772]  I think we actually taped it here at the office, but that's another clip that got off the web where the reporter goes, Oh, thank goodness they stopped her.
[02:45:35.172 --> 02:45:35.792]  Oh, thank goodness.
[02:45:35.832 --> 02:45:39.034]  And reporters are grabbing at her mouth and trying to help shut her up.
[02:45:39.134 --> 02:45:41.756]  Oh, we're all good little Nazis here.
[02:45:43.397 --> 02:45:55.904]  But the point here is, China is run by murdering killers who do kill dissidents and take their organs and do arrest Christians and do arrest Buddhists and do steal people's property and does incredibly horrible things.
[02:45:57.748 --> 02:46:00.129]  And our media acts like it's normal and okay.
[02:46:00.369 --> 02:46:08.892]  These people have killed more of their own citizens by far, tripling what Hitler did, killing more than 10 million than what the Soviets killed in Russia.
[02:46:11.452 --> 02:46:22.356]  And I've got other quotes in other TV clips where they've got a former Defense Department spokesman who's still on the payroll, obviously, going, very embarrassing, we've got a show where it's tough with stuff like this here.
[02:46:22.376 --> 02:46:26.177]  And then I heard local talk show hosts defending what happened to her.
[02:46:27.049 --> 02:46:29.711]  Saying it's great and she's good and they hope they charge her.
[02:46:29.731 --> 02:46:33.694]  And what she said is, the days of the Communist Party and its abuse of the Falun Gong are numbered.
[02:46:34.314 --> 02:46:36.696]  They spun that into, ooh, the President's days are numbered.
[02:46:36.756 --> 02:46:37.776]  She's threatening.
[02:46:40.178 --> 02:46:43.100]  Go ahead and start rolling the clip where I confronted Bush four years ago.
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:44.841]  No, no, this is eight years ago.
[02:46:44.861 --> 02:46:45.201]  Excuse me.
[02:46:45.221 --> 02:46:45.742]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:46:46.562 --> 02:46:49.604]  The victory will be more than just politics as far as I'm concerned.
[02:46:50.565 --> 02:46:53.247]  The victory will be an endorsement of a philosophy.
[02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:59.301]  I believe in my heart of hearts the victory in 1998 is going to be good for Texas.
[02:46:59.561 --> 02:47:02.221]  And that's the most important thing about the campaign.
[02:47:02.681 --> 02:47:05.902]  Wouldn't the... Sir, shouldn't we abolish the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[02:47:06.522 --> 02:47:09.322]  That's the real reality that none of you will talk about and most of you are members.
[02:47:10.203 --> 02:47:11.983]  That's what's destroying this country, Governor.
[02:47:14.063 --> 02:47:15.484]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[02:47:16.124 --> 02:47:18.024]  What about the Federal Reserve and the CFR?
[02:47:19.424 --> 02:47:20.624]  You people are being lied to.
[02:47:20.644 --> 02:47:22.145]  This country's been taken over by Europe.
[02:47:22.625 --> 02:47:23.465]  And I'm being drug up.
[02:47:23.625 --> 02:47:24.165]  Laugh at it!
[02:47:31.477 --> 02:47:41.684]  Let's grab an arm.
[02:47:41.804 --> 02:47:50.050]  And they dragged me out and almost break my arm and then drive me around for an hour and throw me out on the side of the highway.
[02:47:51.758 --> 02:47:55.761]  They did the same thing to Alan Keyes when he was scheduled in a Republican debate on the debate list.
[02:47:56.101 --> 02:48:00.784]  He'd made the grade getting enough votes in the polls.
[02:48:01.804 --> 02:48:05.146]  His numbers were high enough to be there, and they dropped him out in a crack-infested neighborhood.
[02:48:05.166 --> 02:48:06.007]  He almost got mugged.
[02:48:07.428 --> 02:48:08.989]  And you can watch that video.
[02:48:09.009 --> 02:48:10.770]  That was when he was Governor Bush.
[02:48:12.331 --> 02:48:14.072]  And by the way, that was a press conference.
[02:48:14.617 --> 02:48:17.519]  He was going to give a short speech at a press conference, and they saw me in the front.
[02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:19.481]  They go up and announce, no questions.
[02:48:20.062 --> 02:48:20.922]  Bush does his speech.
[02:48:20.982 --> 02:48:23.424]  I had the pre-prepared speech from the governor's website.
[02:48:24.205 --> 02:48:28.388]  When it ended, I asked a question, and you saw what just happened.
[02:48:29.569 --> 02:48:32.832]  In the paper it reported, he turned to one of his colleagues, and I'll tell you what he said when we get back.
[02:48:34.525 --> 02:48:36.047]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:36.227 --> 02:48:39.310]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:39.450 --> 02:48:43.354]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:43.394 --> 02:48:47.619]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:47.979 --> 02:48:51.743]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:48:51.883 --> 02:48:53.685]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:48:56.547 --> 02:49:01.931]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:02.091 --> 02:49:05.133]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:05.313 --> 02:49:08.215]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:08.675 --> 02:49:14.800]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:15.840]  We're good to go.
[02:49:34.233 --> 02:49:39.198]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:49:39.498 --> 02:49:44.943]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:49:44.983 --> 02:49:49.267]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.

[02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:56.373]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:49:56.693 --> 02:50:06.036]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:09.817]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:10.037 --> 02:50:17.159]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:51:28.998 --> 02:51:44.791]  Final segment of the final broadcast this week.
[02:51:45.131 --> 02:51:47.453]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back on Monday, 11 to 2.
[02:51:48.684 --> 02:51:50.165]  Central Standard Time.
[02:51:51.646 --> 02:51:56.330]  But it was in the local papers that after they drugged me out, everybody cheers.
[02:51:57.170 --> 02:52:00.212]  Bush said, that's the freedom we have in America and Texas.
[02:52:00.232 --> 02:52:01.613]  That's the freedom we have of speech.
[02:52:02.294 --> 02:52:04.315]  Like a big joke, he snickered and laughed.
[02:52:05.036 --> 02:52:08.779]  You can't hear that on tape because the camera guy was videotaping me, but I had a handheld microphone.
[02:52:08.839 --> 02:52:10.420]  They took it away from me and drug me out.
[02:52:10.996 --> 02:52:12.776]  And they walked out with my microphone with me.
[02:52:13.116 --> 02:52:19.097]  By the time you hear the cheering, I'm going out the front door with them with my arm behind my back with my fist cranked up to my neck.
[02:52:19.978 --> 02:52:21.518]  And they pushed me up against the wall.
[02:52:21.578 --> 02:52:22.778]  And boy, you're going down.
[02:52:22.838 --> 02:52:25.779]  And put me in the squad car and drove me around.
[02:52:25.819 --> 02:52:30.999]  And the governors, people came over the radio and just said, drive them around for a while and go to the cell phone.
[02:52:31.019 --> 02:52:32.080]  They called them back on the cell phone.
[02:52:32.100 --> 02:52:38.801]  But then Bush turns to, I believe it was K. Billy Hutchinson at the time, turned to the senator and said, that's Alex Jones.
[02:52:38.821 --> 02:52:39.481]  He's the one who...
[02:52:40.538 --> 02:52:42.559]  As they're dragging me out before he makes a snide comment.
[02:52:42.579 --> 02:52:46.760]  That's the one who... And then whispers in her ear, so we don't know that I'm the one who what's.
[02:52:48.081 --> 02:52:54.924]  But... America's always been about these people being accessible, especially at open events.
[02:52:54.944 --> 02:52:56.324]  It was open to the public, not just press.
[02:52:56.344 --> 02:52:57.285]  There were no press passes.
[02:52:58.145 --> 02:53:04.067]  They had a big press riser there, and all these reporters up front ready to ask questions, and all these DuPont photo masking plant employees worshipping him.
[02:53:04.087 --> 02:53:05.948]  And he finishes up his speech...
[02:53:06.775 --> 02:53:11.439]  And they're clapping, and I bust in with, you know, the globalists are selling out America.
[02:53:12.339 --> 02:53:13.120]  And what happened to me?
[02:53:15.602 --> 02:53:16.402]  I got drug off.
[02:53:18.204 --> 02:53:24.409]  Now, you'll have 500 Bush supporters on a public street, on the sidewalk, supporting one person with a sign saying they don't support Bush.
[02:53:24.849 --> 02:53:26.530]  They take him to jail, and they get six months in prison.
[02:53:28.192 --> 02:53:31.174]  And now they're talking about charging that lady with some type of terrorism charge.
[02:53:32.466 --> 02:53:35.407]  They asked his lordship and the butchering dictator next to him.
[02:53:35.947 --> 02:53:37.548]  Bush must really admire him.
[02:53:38.468 --> 02:53:44.410]  He gets to kill whoever he wants and take whoever's organs he wants and melt down their flesh for collagen for your rich wives.
[02:53:44.430 --> 02:53:46.151]  I mean, this is a nightmare.
[02:53:46.211 --> 02:53:47.731]  Think about what we're dealing with.
[02:53:49.912 --> 02:53:51.532]  We're totally in bed with these criminals.
[02:53:51.572 --> 02:53:57.374]  This talk show host yesterday here locally kept going, on another station, kept going, well, we're in bed with them.
[02:53:57.394 --> 02:53:57.875]  We've got to do it.
[02:53:57.895 --> 02:53:58.275]  We've got to do it.
[02:53:58.295 --> 02:53:59.135]  We've got to show them we're tough.
[02:54:00.294 --> 02:54:02.195]  In bed with them, we're being raped by the commies.
[02:54:02.675 --> 02:54:03.815]  By the communist Chinese.
[02:54:05.235 --> 02:54:08.396]  I'm going to close out the broadcast here with a lavish plug for my videos.
[02:54:09.217 --> 02:54:13.658]  I really hope that you won't procrastinate, that you'll think about how important this information is.
[02:54:15.278 --> 02:54:19.300]  How effective my films and other films and books we carry are at waking people up.
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:26.482]  The power of you, the listeners, getting the hard copy DVDs or VHS tapes, making copies of them, burning copies of them.
[02:54:28.115 --> 02:54:30.856]  One time I got a snail mail letter going, burn copies?
[02:54:30.956 --> 02:54:33.857]  For people that don't have computers, that's a term of making copies on a computer.
[02:54:34.858 --> 02:54:35.958]  And getting them out to folks.
[02:54:36.018 --> 02:54:38.259]  If you already have my videos, make copies.
[02:54:38.319 --> 02:54:39.359]  Keep making copies.
[02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:43.641]  So if the globalists carry out more terror attacks, more people will know who was behind it.
[02:54:46.142 --> 02:54:49.343]  We could easily be in a situation soon where there's not even free media anymore.
[02:54:50.083 --> 02:54:51.784]  There could be another terror attack any time.
[02:54:51.844 --> 02:54:55.806]  It's so important to strike while the iron's hot and to wake people up now.
[02:54:55.846 --> 02:54:56.666]  We got discounts.
[02:54:57.373 --> 02:55:00.355]  On my films, as low as $5.95 apiece when you get multiple copies.
[02:55:01.215 --> 02:55:03.476]  Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, Order of Death.
[02:55:03.536 --> 02:55:07.198]  I carry a lot of other great books and videos that are up on the website.
[02:55:07.218 --> 02:55:09.499]  A lot of big specials that you need to take advantage of.
[02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:15.543]  Infowars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart at the video and bookstore.

[02:55:18.244 --> 02:55:20.865]  All 14 of my films, my new film in a month or so will be up there.
[02:55:22.046 --> 02:55:25.568]  My book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, video interviews here in studio.
[02:55:26.889 --> 02:55:28.910]  It's all up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:29.270 --> 02:55:30.951]  15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.

[02:55:41.116 --> 02:55:42.216]  That was quite a show today.
[02:55:54.776 --> 02:56:04.799]  And I'm going to terminate this transmission in about 15 seconds and get to work editing a new video we're making, doing other radio interviews, and spending some time with my family this weekend.
[02:56:04.819 --> 02:56:10.780]  I hope you do the same and count the cost and think about your children and join us in the fight against the New World Order and come in for the big win.
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:11.901]  God bless you all.
[02:56:24.611 --> 02:56:24.799]  Hello!
