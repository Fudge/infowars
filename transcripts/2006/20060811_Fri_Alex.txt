[00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:06.492]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:08.214]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:10.016]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.497]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:13.159]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.523]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:22.127]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.511]  It is Friday, the 11th day of August 2006.
[00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:31.575]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:34.516]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:48.062]  Paul Watson, joining us from England, will give us a little ten-minute report at the bottom of the hour, how the Brits are responding to the government's fear-mongering, saying this is the greatest threat that England has faced since the German Blitz.
[00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:49.723]  That is just ridiculous.
[00:00:51.383 --> 00:01:01.270]  We've also now gotten some hindsight on the fear-mongering announcements that they arrested 21, now a 22nd, pregnant lady, 8 months pregnant.
[00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.292]  Oh, we're all about to be killed by her.
[00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:04.612]  It's so deadly.
[00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:06.013]  Give up all your rights.
[00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:08.215]  Bush's approval ratings are now going back up.
[00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.378]  And they admit they're trying to politically capitalize on it.
[00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:14.540]  Again, who has the motive for all of this?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.281]  We're going to go over it today.
[00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:28.731]  Meanwhile, the neocons and their followers are busy beating the drum, openly saying, World War II is... World War III, excuse me, is absolutely needed, and it's just going to be wonderful.
[00:01:30.193 --> 00:01:45.946]  And just like they claim that Saddam threw dead babies out of incubators, or that the Iranians make Jews wear yellow stars, and again, back of the paper admitted that that was all lies, but front of the paper, people read that, the general public still believes both of those things the government admits were hoaxes.
[00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:54.624]  Well, they now claim that Iran is going to launch an Armageddon with imaginary nuclear weapons that do not exist on August 22nd.
[00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:57.169]  This started last week in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:07.304]  And the professor that reported it said that this is just vague conjecture of some small Muslim sect that he is then extrapolating their text.
[00:02:07.684 --> 00:02:21.553]  He literally is making this up, and he says it's not true, but by the time it gets on to neocon sickos like Glenn Beck and the rest of them, it is certain the Muslims are going to kill us, and the end of the world is August 22nd.
[00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:27.757]  And of course, when it doesn't happen, the neocons won't get in any trouble for this.
[00:02:28.538 --> 00:02:40.870]  They'll just go on to the next hoax and continue hoaxing a general public that is so in the dark, 30% of Americans don't even know what year 9-11 happened in a major poll that came out two days ago.
[00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:43.313]  Don't even know what year it happened.
[00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:54.046]  And guaranteed these same people don't know the Bill of Rights, don't know the Constitution, can't find Iraq on a map, but I'll guarantee you that 30% loves George Bush and thinks he's conservative.
[00:02:54.387 --> 00:02:58.172]  These are people who literally don't know anything about anything.
[00:02:58.773 --> 00:02:59.234]  They just
[00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:06.647]  They just mindlessly like herd animals like a stampede of lemmings.
[00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:08.848]  They think open borders are conservative.
[00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:11.109]  They think the end of this country is conservative.
[00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.090]  They think massive big government is conservative.
[00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.851]  These people are scum.
[00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:26.555]  And of course they're all herded and controlled by the Judascoats, the Glenn Becks, and the Rush Limbaughs, and the Sean Hannity's of the world.
[00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:36.711]  And that's why we'll probably lose the Second Amendment and lose total sovereignty, and then this country is basically going to be gone very soon, and these people are such stupid scum, they won't even know it!
[00:03:37.532 --> 00:03:38.233]  They won't even know it!
[00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:39.153]  They don't care!
[00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:40.354]  They're trash!
[00:03:40.774 --> 00:03:42.255]  Alright, I'm going to control myself.
[00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:44.457]  I hate them so much now.
[00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:52.923]  As a real paleo-conservative who really wants to save the Second Amendment and our sovereignty, I see our country literally sinking like a ship.
[00:03:53.715 --> 00:04:08.444]  Literally on the edge of keeling over on its side, rotating water quickly, and I watched the deck covered with a bunch of bleating, ninnying, nattering, mindless people who think our enemies are our friends.
[00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:12.727]  It's just, it's too rich for me to have to sit here and face this.
[00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:19.431]  When we get back though, I'm going to engage in the supreme effort to calmly
[00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:38.956]  Go into the analysis I brought forward yesterday with more detail, more angles, on why I believe, barring a gargantuan effort, a monolithic effort to expose government-sponsored terror, that we see the confluence, the intersection of all these different elements.
[00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:48.022]  I see the New World Order staging a spectacular war provocation, that is terror event, in the next two months.
[00:04:48.943 --> 00:04:50.144]  We'll be right back
[00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:51.628]  Stay with us.
[00:04:51.688 --> 00:04:53.209]  This is very important radio.
[00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.050]  Again, stay with us.
[00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:05.116]  It's here.
[00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:10.099]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:18.063]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:25.831]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.232 --> 00:05:37.700]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.483]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.943 --> 00:05:43.845]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.205 --> 00:05:48.048]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:07.466]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.731]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:08.472]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.172 --> 00:08:10.333]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.953 --> 00:08:11.754]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:13.355]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:18.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.258 --> 00:08:22.380]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:25.963]  Alright, my friends.
[00:08:26.063 --> 00:08:30.766]  It's been a long and dangerous and sad and frightening week.
[00:08:31.787 --> 00:08:33.668]  It is Friday, the 11th day of August, 2006.
[00:08:34.188 --> 00:08:39.690]  Dar Jamal, fresh back from the front lines in southern Lebanon.
[00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.111]  He's also been in Syria, been in the capital of Lebanon, Beirut.
[00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:47.393]  He's been there for, I guess, about a month since the fighting started.
[00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:50.694]  He got there right when it started and has just got back yesterday.
[00:08:50.794 --> 00:08:55.536]  He'll be joining us from a good old landline, not a sat phone.
[00:08:56.292 --> 00:09:02.415]  In fact, again, he was down there in Kwana and some of the places where the big massacres took place in Darjeelmal.
[00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:05.436]  An American of Lebanese descent, a Christian.
[00:09:05.456 --> 00:09:11.999]  I know most of the neocon types out there think that all people from the Middle East are Muslim.
[00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:14.340]  That actually shows how stupid and ignorant you are.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.902]  He'll be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:18.262 --> 00:09:23.204]  Paul Watson for a little ten minute report at the bottom of the hour in about twenty minutes or so.
[00:09:24.187 --> 00:09:29.801]  He'll be coming on because he's in England, where they are on red alert.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:36.504]  In the country itself, here, only our, quote, airports are on red alert.
[00:09:37.164 --> 00:09:41.287]  First it was a dozen airports yesterday, now they're saying hundreds more.
[00:09:41.387 --> 00:09:47.992]  I have the AP report here that will be under... So see, now it's, oh, it's martial law here, or it's there.
[00:09:48.072 --> 00:09:51.454]  And we decide, well, the whole country might as well be then.
[00:09:51.834 --> 00:09:53.155]  We know they're using the airports.
[00:09:53.715 --> 00:09:55.937]  Federal admissions, I've seen it come out of Ridge's mouth.
[00:09:56.777 --> 00:10:01.460]  To train everyone and that life in the airports will be life on the streets of the U.S.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:07.244]  and now they've announced they're going to have troops and police and FBI and Viper teams in shopping malls.
[00:10:07.284 --> 00:10:11.507]  They want to put turnstiles and x-ray machines in the shopping malls.
[00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:16.010]  This is all being announced but the border will stay wide open.
[00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:24.055]  But let me calm down right now and just go through the analysis that's why you're tuning in to the broadcast.
[00:10:26.414 --> 00:10:54.401]  I noticed there were some blogs and news articles I got emailed yesterday, but where people kindly posted on hundreds of websites my alert, my red alert, that the global crime syndicate, the military black ops squads, the indicators, the pattern, the signature is there, that I've only seen one other time, right before 9-11, and this one is not as clear as 9-11.
[00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:54.781]  I want to be
[00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:58.827]  We're good to go.
[00:11:13.812 --> 00:11:21.675]  Really, if you knew what you were looking at there, it was, so I could go on air and say, on radio and TV, call the White House, tell them, don't attack the World Trade Centers and blame it on your asset.
[00:11:21.695 --> 00:11:26.077]  There's some of Bin Laden, there'll probably be airplanes being blown up and involved in it.
[00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:42.943]  That was just because I had their own manuals, their own handbooks, I'd seen their past actions, I had a few sources saying, look out, something coming in New York, and I saw CFR members go on CNBC and brag about how there was going to be massive terror attacks and they were going to take all our rights.
[00:11:43.752 --> 00:11:44.814]  They were celebrating.
[00:11:45.154 --> 00:11:46.376]  These guys do it out in the open.
[00:11:47.758 --> 00:11:49.841]  There were literally hundreds of other points.
[00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:50.843]  That's the problem.
[00:11:51.183 --> 00:11:54.428]  I study this, I look at it, and then I try to articulate it.
[00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:55.910]  It's very complex.
[00:11:56.631 --> 00:11:57.653]  Really, it's an art form.
[00:12:00.012 --> 00:12:13.260]  It's like somebody who's an expert on football, been coaching it their whole life, or watching it their whole life, and they eat, breathe, and sleep it, and you ask them, well, how did you know they were about to run a bootleg 49 to the right?
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.923]  Or, you know, how did you know they were going to do a handoff?
[00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:24.728]  It's just, you've been watching it so long, studying it, that you know what you're seeing.
[00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:26.769]  You can tell the body language, all of it.
[00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:53.691]  And again, it's not like I'm one of these people that gets on air and goes, Houston will be nuked on this date, and then it never happens, and I don't get on air and I say, you know, uh, why there's shootouts with French intelligence underneath in Chicago, and they're saving us from the Mossad, and of course it's all just made up disinformation tripe from the same people that always bring you the disinfo.
[00:12:54.463 --> 00:12:55.183]  I don't do that.
[00:12:55.623 --> 00:12:57.124]  I don't follow the rabbit trails.
[00:12:57.204 --> 00:12:59.044]  I don't jump on every bandwagon.
[00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:08.607]  That's why, despite all of my crazed, bombastic rants, people know there's something real to this broadcast.
[00:13:09.308 --> 00:13:11.868]  People understand that we really do our homework.
[00:13:11.888 --> 00:13:12.769]  We really do work hard.
[00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:23.752]  My biggest falling, my biggest shortcoming, is that I calmly do the analysis and then I get all upset about it and I get on air.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:32.107]  And it takes energy to, you know, get on air and articulate this, and it's kind of like as adding a match to gasoline, I go ahead and explode.
[00:13:32.127 --> 00:13:41.477]  I mean, this is upsetting to know we have a government that carries out terror attacks, that's totally criminal, and hundreds and hundreds of their crimes are admitted publicly.
[00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:45.801]  Stuff that's so horrific, each crime is enough to overthrow the whole government.
[00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:54.862]  And they're putting in a cashless society, dehumanization, control, tracking, taxation grid.
[00:13:55.994 --> 00:14:02.300]  And a large portion of the public literally doesn't even know the basics of the planet we live on.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.143]  Geography, politics, sociology.
[00:14:05.464 --> 00:14:07.085]  They don't even know what those words mean.
[00:14:07.706 --> 00:14:09.608]  And again, I'm not even that smart.
[00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.149]  That's what shocks me.
[00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:18.076]  The real world is so incredible, so dynamic, so exciting, so exhilarating, so horrifying.
[00:14:18.616 --> 00:14:21.277]  So complex, so beautiful, so ugly.
[00:14:21.637 --> 00:14:22.898]  How could you not look at it?
[00:14:23.218 --> 00:14:24.658]  How could you not want to understand it?
[00:14:24.818 --> 00:14:29.200]  How could you not want to spend your life learning how the world works and being involved?
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.421]  Not these people, man.
[00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:37.383]  It's all about self-gratification, all about the next bestial level of their brain they want to feed.
[00:14:37.403 --> 00:14:41.965]  And folks, that's got a part in your life that you're supposed to be balanced.
[00:14:42.848 --> 00:15:01.300]  Literally, the people that just feed and feed and feed, uh, ad nauseum, their animal sinners are totally unhappy, and they're like, no matter how much I feed my sinners, no matter how much I shink into the flesh, I just get more unhappy!
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.061]  Well, of course you're unhappy!
[00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:06.723]  Humans are first and foremost builders, creators.
[00:15:07.378 --> 00:15:12.241]  People a hundred years ago wrote about rocket ships to the moon and laser beams and computers.
[00:15:12.702 --> 00:15:13.742]  We envisioned it.
[00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.063]  It was then built.
[00:15:15.724 --> 00:15:23.288]  As Genesis, the first book in the Bible, tells us, we were made in God's image as creators.
[00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.873]  We literally are a shadow of the entity that formed the heavens.
[00:15:31.124 --> 00:15:34.166]  And even if you don't believe in God, which I do, look at the evidence!
[00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:35.647]  Look at us!
[00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:37.788]  Look at what we do!
[00:15:38.149 --> 00:15:40.690]  The potential is limitless!
[00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:43.472]  You cannot deny it!
[00:15:43.552 --> 00:15:44.953]  We are creators!
[00:15:45.373 --> 00:15:48.795]  We envision, and then we manifest with that brain.
[00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:51.237]  Our brain is such a powerful computer.
[00:15:53.247 --> 00:15:59.972]  That we envision something, we imagine something, and we can actually create it very quickly.
[00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:06.538]  And instead of taking 50 years for something that humans envision to become reality, now technology is doubling exponentially.
[00:16:06.878 --> 00:16:09.260]  It was every two years, but it keeps doubling so fast.
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.181]  Now it's doubling every 14 months.
[00:16:12.242 --> 00:16:23.170]  And the experts that look at this, depending on what type of technology, are saying it's going to start doubling every six months, and then doubling every month, and then doubling every week, and then doubling every hour, and then doubling every minute.
[00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:25.742]  Do you realize?
[00:16:25.782 --> 00:16:28.284]  And the elite doesn't want us to have access to that.
[00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:29.385]  They are scared.
[00:16:29.425 --> 00:16:33.730]  They know that new elites are going to rise who develop technologies before they do.
[00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:49.425]  So they want a global monopoly, a system where they can suppress and dominate and oppress populations, but more importantly, technology and development of technology so they can have a monopoly, so they can enjoy all of that and we get none of it.
[00:16:50.552 --> 00:16:59.618]  And like they haven't just said that we're going to get none of it, we're going to be exterminated and one child and vaccinated and sterilized out of existence.
[00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:02.059]  No!
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.582]  I am the progeny of those that struggle before me.
[00:17:07.502 --> 00:17:08.423]  And my progeny
[00:17:09.858 --> 00:17:15.523]  Again, I love my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchildren as much as I love my children.
[00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:17.445]  I don't have grandchildren yet.
[00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:25.792]  I don't have great-grandchildren, but I want to work to ensure that my progeny goes forward, and I live on through that progeny.
[00:17:25.872 --> 00:17:34.780]  And you know, grandparents out there, if you can hold your great-great-grandchildren that aren't born yet, you know you love them as much as your own children.
[00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:36.859]  So we're fighting for them.
[00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:39.680]  We have an elite that has hijacked human development.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.980]  We have an elite that hates our development.
[00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:46.382]  An elite that seeks to destroy our development because they're greedy and self-centered.
[00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:49.163]  And because they're threatened by you being free.
[00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:59.347]  And they're using terror to scare you into submission so they can put the final touches on their control prison, on their control grid, and it's horrible.
[00:18:00.047 --> 00:18:01.728]  It's absolutely horrible.
[00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:04.029]  So to put it in a nutshell,
[00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:10.121]  Tom Martino had me on today, a big national show, and he's like, Alex, why do you think everything is a conspiracy?
[00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:13.262]  You know, I know the government is doing some bad stuff, but, you know, is everything?
[00:18:13.322 --> 00:18:14.182]  Is this latest thing?
[00:18:14.242 --> 00:18:15.043]  Is this the government?
[00:18:15.063 --> 00:18:17.063]  You know, why do you think that?
[00:18:17.504 --> 00:18:20.625]  And I said, because the last... I haven't counted them up.
[00:18:20.685 --> 00:18:24.526]  It's like 50-something fake terror alerts and fake busts, just in the U.S.
[00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:24.886]  alone.
[00:18:25.467 --> 00:18:30.268]  And every time, a week later, a month later, sometimes a year later, it comes out it was totally staged.
[00:18:30.949 --> 00:18:34.610]  Every time, it's an FBI or MI6 agent leading the group.
[00:18:36.423 --> 00:18:38.484]  Every time, they go out and create it out of scratch.
[00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:50.572]  Every time, they either totally set up people who are totally innocent, or they go get some idiot to shoot their mouth off at the mosque, and the government hypes it all up and acts like they were about to destroy the entire planet, when they don't even have weapons.
[00:18:51.973 --> 00:18:53.054]  I mean, look at Miami.
[00:18:53.454 --> 00:18:54.295]  Look at Canada.
[00:18:54.335 --> 00:18:56.316]  Look at what has happened in London in the last few months.
[00:18:57.252 --> 00:19:01.514]  Look at how they claim that the Muslims had riots and were going to kill half of London.
[00:19:01.754 --> 00:19:04.136]  Turned out none of them had riots and it was totally made up.
[00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:05.096]  That's admitted!
[00:19:05.516 --> 00:19:06.797]  Made up by MI6!
[00:19:07.177 --> 00:19:08.258]  Made up by the military!
[00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:23.065]  Then you've got other real events where the FBI cooks the bomb, trains the driver, gives them the detonators, lets the bombing go forward, World Trade Center, where they go out and find people and actually, our government leads real Muslim extremists to attack us.
[00:19:24.053 --> 00:19:28.295]  Yes, there are real cases, but it's only as real as far as our government goes and does it.
[00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:30.756]  Same thing on Oklahoma City.
[00:19:31.237 --> 00:19:31.817]  Same thing.
[00:19:32.897 --> 00:19:33.638]  It's a fact.
[00:19:34.678 --> 00:19:35.899]  Again, the government has the motive.
[00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:37.800]  Look, Bush's approval ratings are going up.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.942]  And, when we get back, I'm going to go over it.
[00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:52.567]  In the five short minutes we've got before Paul Watson joins us, I'm going to lay out why, as it stands now, you are going to see a massive terror attack in the next two months
[00:19:53.695 --> 00:19:56.297]  I'm trying to really study it and narrow down where it could be.
[00:19:56.337 --> 00:19:58.318]  I've got a few scenarios that I think they may launch.
[00:19:58.878 --> 00:20:02.180]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.742]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[00:20:05.902 --> 00:20:11.805]  The water east of the continental divide travels downhill over 1,600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:20:11.966 --> 00:20:16.708]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost 1,000 miles to reach the Pacific Ocean.
[00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:19.490]  As you ponder this miracle, ask yourself this question.
[00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.814]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[00:20:24.294 --> 00:20:28.318]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified, simply, internationally.
[00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:32.102]  At the heart of these portable systems are the Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:20:32.282 --> 00:20:37.647]  So powerful, these elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and DNA.
[00:20:37.927 --> 00:20:40.488]  Yeah, they can purify that downward-flowing water.
[00:20:40.588 --> 00:20:47.492]  Berkey Purification Systems get rid of the unhealthy stuff in your water while leaving you healthy beneficial materials that your body needs.
[00:20:47.712 --> 00:20:51.334]  For more information on powerful Berkey Purifiers, call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:51.374 --> 00:20:53.955]  Call today, that's 888-803-4438, or visit us on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:05.262]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:05.662 --> 00:21:11.090]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:12.653]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:16.719]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:30.685]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:36.487]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:36.787 --> 00:21:42.670]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:43.425 --> 00:21:44.766]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:44.786 --> 00:21:49.450]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.093]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.553 --> 00:21:57.096]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:57.116 --> 00:21:58.637]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.919 --> 00:22:07.864]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:13.168]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:22:13.894 --> 00:22:20.940]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:30.587]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[00:22:31.248 --> 00:22:36.332]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:36.832 --> 00:22:37.333]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.771 --> 00:22:48.093]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:49.154 --> 00:22:50.114]  Just call today.
[00:22:50.234 --> 00:22:53.255]  Our operators are standing by to take your subscription.
[00:22:53.335 --> 00:22:54.596]  It's absolutely free.
[00:23:01.115 --> 00:23:06.396]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:23:06.657 --> 00:23:09.257]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:23:09.677 --> 00:23:12.238]  But then my podiatrist gave me Kallax Ointment.
[00:23:12.598 --> 00:23:17.579]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.341]  Kallax never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:23.221]  Now they look and feel great!
[00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:27.042]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Kallax Ointment.
[00:23:27.362 --> 00:23:30.263]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:23:31.721 --> 00:23:34.202]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:36.584]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:40.466]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:47.590]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:23:48.371 --> 00:23:50.572]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:23:50.952 --> 00:23:51.193]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.213 --> 00:23:51.673]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:13.137 --> 00:24:15.078]  Okay, so to boil it down, this is what's happening.
[00:24:18.059 --> 00:24:22.840]  The PNAC boys, the globalists, openly have said they want to invade 65 countries.
[00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:27.242]  They have successfully taken two of those countries over.
[00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:29.783]  And of course, Serbia was on the list.
[00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:39.883]  Before that, so they did that back in the late 1990s in a successful total overthrow in 2000 and they killed Slobodan Milošević, of course, with the poison which was found in his blood.
[00:24:41.545 --> 00:24:43.426]  Then the UN claimed he poisoned himself.
[00:24:43.466 --> 00:24:44.086]  Yes, sure.
[00:24:44.747 --> 00:24:45.728]  That makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:47.369 --> 00:24:53.894]  So they are killing and taking over the leadership of the governments that they wish to invade.
[00:24:53.914 --> 00:24:56.376]  They want to go into Iran and Syria.
[00:24:57.469 --> 00:25:04.554]  They're all over the news claiming that Iran plans, and you go research it, there is no connection to reality.
[00:25:04.894 --> 00:25:07.136]  It is not in the Quran, it's not in their teachings.
[00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:16.202]  They say that Ahmedinejad, the president of Iran, believes the end of the world is on the 22nd of this month, and is going to destroy the planet.
[00:25:16.482 --> 00:25:17.343]  I mean, I have the articles.
[00:25:17.403 --> 00:25:22.246]  It says he is going to start Armageddon, and then no evidence of how he's going to destroy the planet.
[00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:24.536]  It's like saying, I'm going to destroy the planet.
[00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:31.898]  You know, I have the power to fire laser beams out of my fingers and, you know, power beams like a superhero and blow the planet up.
[00:25:32.158 --> 00:25:32.739]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:34.379]  You have a general public in the U.S.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.862]  who can't differentiate between cartoons and superheroes, you know, X-Men, and reality.
[00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:42.682]  And they just hear Achmed Demirjad.
[00:25:42.722 --> 00:25:43.843]  It's all over radio and TV.
[00:25:44.163 --> 00:25:45.323]  He's going to blow the planet up.
[00:25:46.164 --> 00:25:47.164]  It's in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:47.204 --> 00:25:47.964]  It's all over the news.
[00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:49.505]  He's just, the end of the world is on the 22nd.
[00:25:51.334 --> 00:25:53.975]  So that's another one of the reasons I say the globalists are going to pull something.
[00:25:54.735 --> 00:25:56.535]  They are pulling out all the stops right now.
[00:25:57.656 --> 00:26:00.176]  They're saying that Ahmadinejad is behind Lebanon.
[00:26:00.917 --> 00:26:04.778]  They're saying Ahmadinejad is planning to cause Armageddon on the 22nd.
[00:26:05.298 --> 00:26:07.598]  They're saying Hamas and Hezbollah are in the U.S.
[00:26:07.638 --> 00:26:17.061]  and England and are sure to strike us and it's sure to be nuclear and that they supposedly got it from the North Koreans or the Russians or the Pakistanis.
[00:26:17.933 --> 00:26:19.453]  And so I see all of this.
[00:26:19.513 --> 00:26:38.919]  I see the neocons are out in force saying, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke, nuke, like they never have before, just like a gaggle of crows chirping, and it's a chorus of bleating individuals, and they're saying, the only thing they can say is an attack on Iran.
[00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:40.019]  We must attack Iran.
[00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:46.001]  So you have this background noise that, remember, the average American is kind of just halfway listening.
[00:26:47.442 --> 00:26:50.623]  And you can walk around a restaurant or listen to the people at a bus stop.
[00:26:50.643 --> 00:26:51.383]  I mean, I've been doing it.
[00:26:51.423 --> 00:26:53.323]  They're all, have you heard World War III?
[00:26:53.563 --> 00:26:55.424]  Yes, that madman's going to blow us up!
[00:26:55.764 --> 00:27:04.825]  Even people that are somewhat informed are, yeah, I know our government's bad, but that man in Iran, the one with the beard, he said he's going to blow the planet up!
[00:27:06.086 --> 00:27:08.826]  Didn't say that, but believe me, that's out there now.
[00:27:09.246 --> 00:27:12.747]  Well, I mean, I'm sure you've experienced it at the water cooler at work or at church.
[00:27:14.421 --> 00:27:16.682]  And he wants to make Jews wear yellow stars!
[00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:22.403]  I mean, that was in all over the news for two weeks, and they admitted it was a hoax, but that was in the back of the paper.
[00:27:22.663 --> 00:27:23.763]  The retractions are small.
[00:27:24.744 --> 00:27:27.544]  All they remember is that he makes Jews wear yellow stars.
[00:27:28.665 --> 00:27:34.126]  So, they're hyping all of that, and they've had all these fake terror bots that we know were staged,
[00:27:34.787 --> 00:27:39.129]  And then now they have this big one, and now the government's saying, we don't know if we can stop them all!
[00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:40.069]  We don't know!
[00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.969]  It's getting tough!
[00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:42.410]  You gotta work with us!
[00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:53.433]  And Bush's approval rating starts going up, which they've commissioned, the White House admits they've commissioned focus group studies of would the people support the President more if there was another terror attack?
[00:27:53.774 --> 00:27:57.455]  That wasn't just in Capitol Hill Blue, that was in the Associated Press.
[00:27:58.415 --> 00:28:03.597]  Months after Capitol Hill Blue reported on it, a couple years ago, what, two years ago, the White House had studies done.
[00:28:05.001 --> 00:28:09.402]  Now we know there's that new Republican memo saying they know that their ratings will go up if there's another attack.
[00:28:09.762 --> 00:28:18.205]  And so the fact that his ratings now, a day in, are going up is even more of an encouragement for these people to stage another attack.
[00:28:18.265 --> 00:28:20.765]  Now they could do something small like claim a jet's hijacked.
[00:28:21.025 --> 00:28:22.366]  They've already nerve-gassed the crew.
[00:28:22.706 --> 00:28:23.946]  The government will have it all set up.
[00:28:24.686 --> 00:28:27.187]  This could be a plane that doesn't even have supposed patsies on it.
[00:28:28.868 --> 00:28:30.468]  And again, they've done this before, so they could do it again.
[00:28:31.508 --> 00:28:40.111]  And then have our troops, have our military shoot it down, and then have the big controversy that most Americans will support it, and then it'll be like Bush is a big hero.
[00:28:40.211 --> 00:28:43.332]  I hate to give my ideas, but this is a tough... I know they fought it all out.
[00:28:43.352 --> 00:28:44.813]  They're really smart.
[00:28:45.693 --> 00:28:47.254]  That's on the good side of things.
[00:28:47.714 --> 00:28:54.036]  Sure, it'll kill 200 people on a plane, but Bush could get a huge boost, the globalists could get a big boost out of that.
[00:28:54.996 --> 00:28:59.538]  The next biggest step would be a string of truck bombs going off,
[00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.831]  Of course, this is all the less likely stuff.
[00:29:02.871 --> 00:29:05.132]  The more likely is something really big is what I'm seeing happening.
[00:29:06.052 --> 00:29:11.114]  The next less likely, but getting more probable, would be a string of truck bombing.
[00:29:11.774 --> 00:29:16.776]  Minimum of 5, maximum of 15 or so, that go off simultaneously.
[00:29:18.026 --> 00:29:19.468]  But it would go something like this.
[00:29:19.928 --> 00:29:25.873]  Police will bust the truck bomber, and there'll be real cops that are tipped off, and there'll be like two mentally retarded Muslims.
[00:29:26.334 --> 00:29:27.114]  It's always this way.
[00:29:27.435 --> 00:29:28.335]  They'll be on welfare.
[00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:30.958]  And it'll turn out they had FBI handlers, but that won't matter.
[00:29:31.718 --> 00:29:36.002]  There'll be a truck bomb that's about to go off.
[00:29:36.022 --> 00:29:37.223]  They'll bust them.
[00:29:37.243 --> 00:29:38.704]  30 minutes before, and it'll be like the show 24,
[00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:41.531]  They'll go on the news and go, everyone stop!
[00:29:41.731 --> 00:29:42.091]  Police!
[00:29:42.171 --> 00:29:42.812]  Emergency!
[00:29:42.872 --> 00:29:43.452]  Check everywhere!
[00:29:43.472 --> 00:29:44.052]  Guard the buildings!
[00:29:44.232 --> 00:29:44.593]  Oh no!
[00:29:45.073 --> 00:29:45.873]  Simultaneously!
[00:29:45.893 --> 00:29:46.614]  They're going off!
[00:29:46.654 --> 00:29:48.254]  We didn't stop them!
[00:29:51.896 --> 00:29:52.797]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.297 --> 00:29:54.898]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.818 --> 00:29:58.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:06.154]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[00:30:06.494 --> 00:30:08.535]  And check this out, I bought a new car.
[00:30:08.615 --> 00:30:13.837]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:18.558]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[00:30:18.878 --> 00:30:23.780]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.601]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:30:26.961 --> 00:30:30.283]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:30:30.543 --> 00:30:31.444]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[00:30:31.804 --> 00:30:34.186]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[00:30:34.546 --> 00:30:36.807]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[00:30:36.907 --> 00:30:37.568]  It's incredible!
[00:30:37.948 --> 00:30:45.413]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[00:30:45.753 --> 00:30:50.296]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.971]  Check, please.
[00:30:52.432 --> 00:30:53.314]  I got this one, Bill.
[00:30:53.715 --> 00:30:54.396]  Sure, John.
[00:30:54.557 --> 00:30:59.147]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:30:59.308 --> 00:30:59.548]  Deal.
[00:31:01.801 --> 00:31:04.682]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:31:05.022 --> 00:31:07.904]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:31:08.124 --> 00:31:14.326]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:32:01.656 --> 00:32:06.297]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:07.078]  have diabetes.
[00:32:07.398 --> 00:32:14.360]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.021]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:32:19.221 --> 00:32:22.042]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:18.329]  Welcome back.
[00:33:18.369 --> 00:33:23.230]  Darja Maul just back from Lebanon, the front lines in southern Lebanon, just back to the U.S.
[00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:25.651]  will join us in the next hour to talk about
[00:33:26.468 --> 00:33:30.999]  All of the fake terror attacks our government has been carrying out in Iraq.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.323]  We shouldn't forget that.
[00:33:32.663 --> 00:33:33.185]  Our government.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:50.444]  We know, and the Israelis and the British have all been caught red-handed blowing up mosques, shooting police, bombing crowds of people, assassinating leaders they don't like, or people they do like, but they want to blame it on their enemies.
[00:33:50.864 --> 00:33:51.384]  You understand?
[00:33:51.604 --> 00:33:52.844]  They've caught British SAS.
[00:33:52.884 --> 00:33:53.744]  They've caught Israelis.
[00:33:54.065 --> 00:34:00.426]  The Marines have caught Israelis dressed up as Arabs going around shooting Marines.
[00:34:01.192 --> 00:34:06.137]  And it's in the foreign mainstream papers, there are incidents, and people are told to release them and shut up.
[00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:11.021]  I mean, so all three governments are doing this.
[00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:12.943]  The US, the Brits, and the Israelis.
[00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:21.971]  And so, the establishment likes to claim, well, what, it's all, Alex, you're saying it's all the government?
[00:34:22.432 --> 00:34:22.752]  Yes!
[00:34:22.972 --> 00:34:26.936]  Either it's totally provocateured, it's set up, or it's completely staged.
[00:34:28.513 --> 00:34:41.137]  Every once in a while, there'll be a real Muslim woman who lost her son and daughters, and she'll go into a Jewish restaurant and kill eight people bare-handed with a butcher knife.
[00:34:42.137 --> 00:34:42.417]  Men!
[00:34:42.437 --> 00:34:43.797]  I mean, that's how angry these women get.
[00:34:44.157 --> 00:34:45.378]  And that happens every few months.
[00:34:46.158 --> 00:34:47.759]  And yes, that's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:48.279 --> 00:34:53.580]  And there are real Palestinians that get machine guns and shoot at the Israelis.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.381]  And there are occasionally real suicide bombings.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.261]  But we've studied it.
[00:34:58.441 --> 00:35:03.102]  In most cases, the funding for the suicide bombers actually comes from our government.
[00:35:03.883 --> 00:35:04.803]  Yes, the evidence is there.
[00:35:05.063 --> 00:35:06.124]  You go, why is that?
[00:35:06.584 --> 00:35:07.964]  To keep a military state.
[00:35:08.004 --> 00:35:08.965]  To not have peace.
[00:35:09.545 --> 00:35:11.106]  To keep the crises expanding.
[00:35:11.146 --> 00:35:13.307]  This is a military form of government.
[00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:14.407]  They want war.
[00:35:15.007 --> 00:35:16.468]  This is war provocation.
[00:35:16.528 --> 00:35:19.349]  The military hardware manufacturers want war.
[00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:21.910]  They're making over.
[00:35:22.586 --> 00:35:26.809]  A hundred billion dollars a year in weapons sales and contracts in Iraq alone.
[00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:31.532]  The war on terror is costing another hundred billion a year.
[00:35:32.653 --> 00:35:37.516]  That's on top of the six plus hundred billion for the mainline defense budget.
[00:35:37.676 --> 00:35:38.897]  There's now a whole new budget!
[00:35:39.417 --> 00:35:42.559]  Over a hundred billion in anti-terror here in the U.S.
[00:35:44.588 --> 00:35:48.591]  And now you can't get a scholarship to be a professor or a scholarship to be a scientist.
[00:35:49.071 --> 00:35:53.315]  No, now it's a scholarship for Homeland Security and all the finest, finest schools.
[00:35:53.375 --> 00:35:55.196]  See, the economy is shifting over.
[00:35:55.596 --> 00:36:06.805]  First, the military-industrial complex took over the industry and the media and the colleges, and now they're going to take over all the other major industries and make the economy a police-state economy.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:23.131]  With tens of thousands of graduates with master's degrees and with four-year degrees graduating college right now for Homeland Security, and it's all for surveillance and tracking and all of this, you're going to find terrorists, folks.
[00:36:23.651 --> 00:36:25.332]  And terrorism is the Second Amendment.
[00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:26.673]  It is family rights.
[00:36:26.774 --> 00:36:27.614]  It is property rights.
[00:36:27.994 --> 00:36:29.095]  It is listed as such.
[00:36:30.116 --> 00:36:31.497]  Oh, it's a reign of terror.
[00:36:31.517 --> 00:36:32.698]  We're going to enjoy.
[00:36:33.607 --> 00:36:35.648]  You better believe they're going to provocateur bust.
[00:36:36.169 --> 00:36:39.471]  You better believe they're going to go out and entrap and set people up.
[00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:42.513]  You better believe the government's going to outright carry attacks out.
[00:36:43.213 --> 00:36:44.634]  Because this is the new America.
[00:36:45.315 --> 00:36:51.018]  It's a way of enslaving us, grabbing our property, and then capturing us as an engine to go invade the planet.
[00:36:51.218 --> 00:36:52.179]  And that's the official plan.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:57.983]  And I'm telling you, I see all the lines intersecting right now.
[00:36:59.815 --> 00:37:17.607]  For anything from an A-bomb going off to a string of dirty bombs, down to a staged event where they shoot down a passenger liner and claim it was hijacked, and have a big drama for an hour while it's hijacked, and they'll even have little recordings they're playing over the radio of, they've got me!
[00:37:17.647 --> 00:37:18.627]  The hijackers are here!
[00:37:18.647 --> 00:37:22.330]  I mean, it's just, you can see the Hollywood script and they already did it on 9-11.
[00:37:24.002 --> 00:37:35.290]  By the way, you know, there's all those air phone calls, most of them from phones from 8,000 to 32,000 feet from people's supposed, you know, private phones, but then it gets pointed out that several of the calls were from air phones.
[00:37:36.071 --> 00:37:46.419]  It's the air phone calls where the stewardess is going, I can't breathe, there's something in the cockpit, which fits in what I was told by Pentagon sources of how they gas the people on board.
[00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:47.540]  You see?
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.981]  Again, another issue.
[00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:50.502]  The point is,
[00:37:51.767 --> 00:37:54.448]  That I see the same rhetoric, the same gleam in the eye.
[00:37:55.068 --> 00:37:57.869]  We know their agenda is stalling to attack Iran and Syria.
[00:37:58.069 --> 00:38:01.850]  They're not going to be able to do this, but they're on TV saying, World War III is here.
[00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.050]  We've got to do it.
[00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:03.791]  It's great.
[00:38:04.731 --> 00:38:08.352]  And then there's no provocations in the Middle East, so they start one with Lebanon.
[00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:11.893]  They spin it that Lebanon is just defending itself.
[00:38:13.988 --> 00:38:15.829]  Excuse me, that's a Freudian slip because they are.
[00:38:16.149 --> 00:38:22.491]  They spin it that Israel is just defending itself when Israel is routinely bombarding southern Lebanon.
[00:38:22.851 --> 00:38:24.391]  Hezbollah is always attacking them.
[00:38:25.832 --> 00:38:28.692]  And those troops are always being captured.
[00:38:28.712 --> 00:38:31.273]  They just hype this up and it's not going to stop.
[00:38:33.094 --> 00:38:35.174]  So they need to go into Syria.
[00:38:35.214 --> 00:38:36.455]  They need to go into Iran.
[00:38:36.495 --> 00:38:38.896]  They're saying they openly may strike them any day now.
[00:38:38.976 --> 00:38:40.176]  Bush is openly saying it.
[00:38:41.644 --> 00:38:44.665]  But they're not going to get the people behind it unless there's a big attack.
[00:38:46.426 --> 00:38:56.669]  I don't think it's going to cut it having a string of, oh, you know, we foiled this attack, we foiled that attack, oh, we're on red alert in England, and we're on red alert in American airports.
[00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:05.512]  And I think Bush's approval ratings, now it's being reported, the preliminary numbers came out today, that his numbers are going way up right now.
[00:39:06.352 --> 00:39:06.972]  From 30% to as high as 40%.
[00:39:09.321 --> 00:39:12.464]  And that's going to embolden them to go ahead and say, see, it's going to work.
[00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:16.127]  And they've also got to try to short-circuit the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:39:16.428 --> 00:39:19.611]  If they carry out another big event, people won't remember 9-11 anymore.
[00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:21.573]  It'll all be the new event.
[00:39:22.934 --> 00:39:24.976]  And then if it's something like an A-bomb that's clean,
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:32.844]  A low-yield, maybe one-megaton, two-megaton bomb, it'll kill tens of thousands immediately, hundreds of thousands over the next week.
[00:39:32.884 --> 00:39:34.244]  It'll cause nationwide panic.
[00:39:34.685 --> 00:39:38.867]  Just what they need to radically come in and make the permanent change in the U.S.
[00:39:39.067 --> 00:39:40.087]  to total police state.
[00:39:40.988 --> 00:39:42.048]  So what do you do to stop it?
[00:39:42.769 --> 00:39:44.049]  You make it a major buzz.
[00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:48.072]  You call into every major talk show in the country, local, national.
[00:39:48.492 --> 00:39:50.973]  You pick, each of you, two shows you're going to call in a day.
[00:39:51.313 --> 00:39:52.834]  A local show, a national show.
[00:39:53.174 --> 00:39:54.655]  You call till you get in.
[00:39:56.107 --> 00:40:09.412]  Once you get in, you drop websites that expose 9-11 as an inside job, and you talk about how the government or criminal elements of it are about to stage new terror attacks, and how important it is to get the word out on this, to start World War III.
[00:40:09.772 --> 00:40:13.793]  Again, you explain they need to do this to kick-start World War III.
[00:40:15.173 --> 00:40:16.294]  If there's enough of a buzz,
[00:40:18.675 --> 00:40:22.157]  Just like I said, call the White House and call Congress back in July.
[00:40:22.417 --> 00:40:31.422]  And the phone calls went in, and we documented that thousands of phone calls went in, but the mainstream media won't touch it with a ten-foot pole because there's more evidence than government prior knowledge.
[00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:35.444]  Again, if I even knew it was about to happen, what did the government know?
[00:40:36.745 --> 00:40:39.686]  Alright, joining us from England, I appreciate him coming on board.
[00:40:39.706 --> 00:40:42.308]  He wrote four articles yesterday, he's getting more out today.
[00:40:43.126 --> 00:40:46.429]  They're the most insightful and on target out there about this escalation.
[00:40:46.729 --> 00:40:48.691]  We are entering World War III right now.
[00:40:49.292 --> 00:40:51.734]  If you had a chance to stop World War III, would you?
[00:40:52.334 --> 00:40:56.118]  Don't look back in hindsight and wish you wouldn't have gotten the word out.
[00:40:56.518 --> 00:40:58.060]  Paul Watson, good to have you on with us.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.521]  Good to be back, Alex.
[00:41:00.001 --> 00:41:01.262]  You join us from Sheffield, England.
[00:41:01.282 --> 00:41:04.686]  Your brothers in London also reporting for us on what's happening in England.
[00:41:05.566 --> 00:41:09.430]  Paul, go through the Chronicle of False Flag.
[00:41:10.735 --> 00:41:17.980]  Fake terror busts and fake alerts and then give us the latest on what's happening right now in airstrip one the capital of Oceania.
[00:41:19.321 --> 00:41:36.753]  Okay well to understand the latest terror alert scam in Britain we need to look at it from the perspective of the fact that the British government has been totally and immensely discredited in faking terror alerts for the past five years.
[00:41:38.154 --> 00:41:38.234]  In 2003
[00:41:40.154 --> 00:41:50.937]  January 2003, two months before the war in Iraq, the British government said they had found the poison riocin in a flat in Wood Green in London.
[00:41:52.057 --> 00:42:02.340]  Immediately afterwards, Blair's ministers went out on a PR campaign to push this great new threat that they'd averted by finding this riocin in London.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:08.742]  The British government sent these samples they'd got from the flat to court and down.
[00:42:09.577 --> 00:42:12.219]  Which is a bioweapons government research facility.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:20.265]  They did the analysis and there was no trace of riocin, the actual completed poison.
[00:42:20.706 --> 00:42:22.347]  There was no trace of it whatsoever.
[00:42:22.387 --> 00:42:23.808]  There was no plan to use it.
[00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:26.470]  The British government
[00:42:27.594 --> 00:42:29.395]  For two years afterwards.
[00:42:29.655 --> 00:42:35.679]  Then planted a story in an Afghan cave, which they later had to admit was staged, of plans to use Ryerson.
[00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:47.227]  And don't forget, this is all on the eve of the Gulf War II, with Tony Blair with tanks driving around Heathrow, so it's the same MO, clear indications of a new invasion, they're replaying the same cards.
[00:42:47.987 --> 00:42:53.471]  Yeah, and they didn't admit that the Ryerson plot was non-existent until two years after.
[00:42:53.491 --> 00:42:55.412]  And in fact, two years after,
[00:42:56.112 --> 00:42:59.676]  The director of The Power of Nightmares was given a BAFTA speech.
[00:43:00.036 --> 00:43:07.284]  The BBC excised it from the TV broadcast that went out one hour later because it was, quote, too sensitive.
[00:43:07.344 --> 00:43:08.144]  It touched a nerve.
[00:43:08.665 --> 00:43:17.434]  And that, in that speech, he outlined how the Ryerson plot was completely fabricated and how people should be aware that the government's fabricating terror alerts in Britain.
[00:43:18.345 --> 00:43:26.310]  Then the government went around British newspapers like the Guardian and directly told them to remove the articles from their website.
[00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.451]  What's that particular order in England called?
[00:43:28.511 --> 00:43:29.212]  A D-Notice?
[00:43:29.792 --> 00:43:33.114]  It was in the news that D-Notices were sent out not to report on that.
[00:43:34.295 --> 00:43:38.557]  Yeah, and to retroactively remove all the reports about it being a hoax.
[00:43:38.797 --> 00:43:41.079]  But you screenshot the articles and have them saved.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.461]  Yeah, so that was rioting in 2003.
[00:43:44.501 --> 00:43:45.221]  The British government
[00:43:47.088 --> 00:43:54.012]  Bill used it as PR until 2005 and then they censored anybody from talking about it on the BBC and in British newspapers.
[00:43:56.013 --> 00:44:11.441]  Before the ID card Bill was introduced in the Queen's Speech, I believe it was in 2003 again, we had this plot to attack buildings in London around the Canary Wharf area by terrorist hijacking planes flying them into London landmarks.
[00:44:12.372 --> 00:44:27.823]  Turned out, as the Independent of London reported, that it was cooked up by government lobbyists in alliance with all these heads of news corporations like ITN, who were behind the fake Serbian death camps in the early 90s which launched that war.
[00:44:28.563 --> 00:44:36.609]  Turns out it was all scripted, all manufactured to try and give the ID cards bill which was introduced an extra push to get people in fear so they'd accept it.
[00:44:37.671 --> 00:44:46.974]  Yeah, that plot was recycled again about six weeks ago, two months ago, where they again said they'd foiled this plot against Canary Wharf.
[00:44:47.034 --> 00:44:51.796]  And Paul, you've only gone through like two of these now, we're going to run out of time.
[00:44:52.576 --> 00:44:57.418]  On PrisonPlanet.com you have posted, it's got to be over 20 of them, there's over 50 of them.
[00:44:57.818 --> 00:44:58.558]  Here in the U.S.
[00:44:58.638 --> 00:44:59.419]  it gets worse though.
[00:44:59.439 --> 00:45:02.960]  We have Ari Fleischer and we have us in the Washington Post, Washington Times folks.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.402]  Slipping up in a press conference and saying, it's political, it's staged.
[00:45:07.763 --> 00:45:09.684]  The White House is issuing fake terror alerts.
[00:45:09.704 --> 00:45:14.586]  We have headlines, MSNBC, CNN, CBS.
[00:45:15.007 --> 00:45:18.428]  We have a headline, 23 Intel experts say terror alerts are fake.
[00:45:18.969 --> 00:45:23.831]  So we have a cast iron that they are staging these events.
[00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:30.175]  Then, Paul, what about all the events where they then provocateur patsies or raid innocent houses
[00:45:30.655 --> 00:45:42.446]  And shoot people, or deliver ammonium nitrate to their houses, or go find mind-brain-dead Rastafarian street kids and give them 50 grand to march around as soldiers in Miami.
[00:45:42.726 --> 00:45:47.910]  I mean, this is... Then we've got that whole other class of not just fake terror alerts, but provocateur busts.
[00:45:49.272 --> 00:45:52.875]  Yeah, in Toronto where the ammonium nitrate was delivered,
[00:45:53.294 --> 00:45:58.977]  They had infiltrated the group for at least a year before they had funded the ringleader.
[00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:06.781]  They had them stomping around in these warehouses and fields and gardens in a militaristic fashion, trying to get people's attention.
[00:46:07.701 --> 00:46:09.022]  And that's what a set-up is.
[00:46:09.082 --> 00:46:17.246]  And then in Forest Gate in London, a 300 armed police raided two houses before they raided the suspects.
[00:46:17.286 --> 00:46:21.608]  They raided their neighbours, who were completely unconnected, but they decided to beat them up anyway.
[00:46:22.329 --> 00:46:22.829]  They shoot
[00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.070]  Uh, the suspect's brother.
[00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:27.991]  First they claim his own brother shot him.
[00:46:28.031 --> 00:46:32.672]  They let the police later admit that the police officer himself did shoot him.
[00:46:33.532 --> 00:46:39.593]  And then, two months later, the investigation... They conduct the investigation.
[00:46:39.653 --> 00:46:44.274]  People are trying to charge the police officer on health and safety violations.
[00:46:44.354 --> 00:46:47.835]  Shooting somebody at point-blank range violates health and safety.
[00:46:48.295 --> 00:46:53.196]  But then, uh, about a week ago, the police got absolved of all charges of that anyway.
[00:46:53.641 --> 00:47:00.007]  And obviously, again, it was proven that no dangerous chemicals were found at this address in Forest Gate, London.
[00:47:00.107 --> 00:47:09.215]  But the average person still remembers the big nightly headlines, dun-dun-dun-dun, tonight, top story, deadly nerve gas found, a plan to kill all of London.
[00:47:09.515 --> 00:47:12.237]  It turns out it's totally made up and they've released the people.
[00:47:12.918 --> 00:47:13.398]  Right.
[00:47:13.478 --> 00:47:17.882]  You can just go pick a house with Arabs in it and raid it and claim they had ray guns.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:31.771]  April 2004, the Man Utd suicide bomb plot, the grab occurred, interrogated him at a police station, says he has Manchester United, which is a football team, soccer.
[00:47:32.392 --> 00:47:37.336]  Paraphernalia, which is ticket stubs and match programs and so forth.
[00:47:38.337 --> 00:47:44.243]  Because they bought the tickets, him and his friend from Ticketouts, they were sat in different areas of the stadium.
[00:47:44.898 --> 00:47:50.423]  So they made up this plot that they were planning to bomb the stadium just because they were sitting in two different areas.
[00:47:50.483 --> 00:47:59.751]  And to explain how that happens, a lot of times with tickets, because we've talked about this before, and it's the same in England as it is here in the U.S., if you get tickets at different times, you get different seats.
[00:48:00.832 --> 00:48:08.939]  Yeah, and they bought them from touts, which means you have to go to the match and people sell them at exorbitant prices, and they're obviously in different parts of the stadium.
[00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:11.562]  Again, the papers ran big with it.
[00:48:12.182 --> 00:48:15.403]  Man U suicide bomb plot all turned out to be fake.
[00:48:15.463 --> 00:48:17.404]  It was admitted in the back of the paper.
[00:48:17.884 --> 00:48:23.746]  So to understand that perspective, every single major terror alert has been politicized and faked in Britain.
[00:48:23.766 --> 00:48:26.467]  So why should we believe that this latest one is any different?
[00:48:26.747 --> 00:48:36.470]  Well, also then it fits in with Bojinka, which we know was another staged event where our government for many years tried to get terrorists to actually attack us and tried to have it carried out.
[00:48:37.389 --> 00:48:43.254]  Yeah, the mastermind of which was Ramzi Youssef, who was also the mastermind of the 93 World Trade Center bombing.
[00:48:44.395 --> 00:48:49.599]  The terrorist group in that bombing penetrated by the FBI, yet the attack still went ahead.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.222]  Explosives supplied by the FBI?
[00:48:53.242 --> 00:48:57.845]  Yeah, in a supposed sting operation, but they supplied them with real explosives.
[00:48:59.727 --> 00:49:04.951]  This latest one, we know now that Bush and Blair discussed it last Friday.
[00:49:05.802 --> 00:49:14.007]  So that in itself proves that the timing was in place and it was dedicated, focused timing to release it... Six days before!
[00:49:14.067 --> 00:49:14.968]  Six days before!
[00:49:15.028 --> 00:49:18.330]  Yeah, but now... Months before with the investigation.
[00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:18.750]  Yeah.
[00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:33.540]  So, I mean, that delay tells me that they were so concerned about the fact that they'd been discredited with all these previous terror plots because they'd concocted the evidence and there's no tangible plot.
[00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:45.839]  They waited until these idiots, these morons, whoever they are that they set up, because that's what happens in every case, actually did this dry run, which was reported on last night.
[00:49:45.859 --> 00:49:47.720]  They were caught engaging in a dry run.
[00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:57.587]  So they waited until these patsies could be seen at the scene of the crime and get noticed, and then that would present them with more... But we don't even know if that's true!
[00:49:58.948 --> 00:50:01.510]  Well, not yet, but I mean, that's probably the line they'll go down.
[00:50:02.946 --> 00:50:12.734]  That happened on 9-11 when the actor James Woods reported to the FBI that he thought hijackers were conducting similar drills before 9-11.
[00:50:12.854 --> 00:50:22.701]  Yeah, a lot of times what they do is they hire people and they tell them, oh you're going to take part in some drills with us and then they bust them and set them up and it's just so sick.
[00:50:23.682 --> 00:50:27.605]  Yeah, but the fact they knew about it weeks or months in advance shows that
[00:50:28.171 --> 00:50:29.812]  You know, it's very careful timing.
[00:50:29.892 --> 00:50:30.732]  Suddenly, snap!
[00:50:30.792 --> 00:50:36.475]  It was announced and, you know, baby milk formula became evil and people had to hand in their iPods.
[00:50:37.455 --> 00:50:47.260]  Paul, I want to do one more little segment with you because I want to get your analysis on my concern that I think we're going to have a major terror attack in the next two months.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.503]  The evidence shows it and unless we really have a huge effort to get the word out on this subject,
[00:50:54.562 --> 00:50:57.445]  I want to get your take, your honest take on My Views.
[00:50:57.485 --> 00:50:58.145]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.466 --> 00:51:05.271]  It's here.
[00:51:05.471 --> 00:51:10.255]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.616 --> 00:51:18.242]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.953 --> 00:51:25.996]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.396 --> 00:51:37.860]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.641]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.102 --> 00:51:44.042]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.362 --> 00:51:48.184]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:56.673 --> 00:54:05.917]  We don't need no education.
[00:54:07.418 --> 00:54:09.799]  We don't need any thought control, my friends.
[00:54:11.633 --> 00:54:12.234]  Welcome back.
[00:54:12.254 --> 00:54:15.717]  Dar Jamal just got back from the front lines in Lebanon.
[00:54:16.138 --> 00:54:22.464]  He also is an expert on government-sponsored terror and has witnessed it up close in Iraq and other areas.
[00:54:22.924 --> 00:54:30.992]  He'll be with us, and 30 minutes into the next hour, we're going to have open phones for the balance of the broadcast, the second half of the broadcast today.
[00:54:31.012 --> 00:54:32.354]  I'm going to take a lot of your phone calls.
[00:54:33.647 --> 00:54:41.472]  Don't forget, coming up on the 26th of this month in Dallas, Texas, that's a Saturday, from 7 to 2 in the morning, we're going to show my film Terror Storm.
[00:54:41.512 --> 00:54:42.193]  I'll give a speech.
[00:54:42.573 --> 00:54:45.975]  Professor Jim Maher is an expert on government-sponsored terror and the New World Order.
[00:54:46.336 --> 00:54:48.057]  We'll give an hour-long speech and take questions.
[00:54:48.077 --> 00:54:51.379]  Then I'll air about 35 minutes of footage shot up at the Bilderberg Group.
[00:54:51.859 --> 00:54:53.981]  That'll be an exclusive and we'll have a lot of press there.
[00:54:54.021 --> 00:54:54.981]  It'll be a great 9-11 event.
[00:54:55.001 --> 00:54:59.364]  Then we're going to have live music from around 11.30 to 2 in the morning.
[00:55:00.919 --> 00:55:02.900]  But it's an event you don't want to miss.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:11.224]  Tickets available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:11.664 --> 00:55:14.825]  And my new film, Terror Storm, is out.
[00:55:15.405 --> 00:55:16.726]  It's the best film I've ever made.
[00:55:16.806 --> 00:55:27.871]  It's the history of government-sponsored terror, the 7-7 bombings, the fake terror alerts, SAS British troops caught carrying out terror attacks, 9-11, just it's an incredible film.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:43.623]  You need to get Terror Storm available at Infowars.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or get a 15 cent a day membership at PrisonPlanet.tv and see all 15 of my films in super high quality bandwidth.
[00:55:44.023 --> 00:55:45.524]  A lot better than you'll find anywhere else.
[00:55:45.964 --> 00:55:47.624]  My weekly TV reports and a lot more.
[00:55:48.524 --> 00:55:51.465]  Paul Watson, the last three minutes we've got left in this hour.
[00:55:52.585 --> 00:55:53.985]  You know I haven't made other predictions.
[00:55:54.065 --> 00:55:57.206]  I've made one other prediction and I said then we could stop it.
[00:55:58.261 --> 00:56:00.742]  I think we're in the most danger we've been in since the anthrax attacks after 9-11 of
[00:56:25.683 --> 00:56:29.184]  The government staging an attack on whatever scale.
[00:56:29.764 --> 00:56:32.465]  I don't think it'll be kind of a medium-scale 9-11.
[00:56:32.625 --> 00:56:46.690]  It'll either continue to be small-scale, like the London bombings which killed 50-some people, or it will be a lot bigger, radiological New King of the City in the West or in Israel.
[00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:49.030]  Because that's what the propaganda has been.
[00:56:49.771 --> 00:56:50.951]  Brainwashing into people.
[00:56:50.991 --> 00:56:51.711]  That's a key point.
[00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:53.452]  They always lay the script down before.
[00:56:53.672 --> 00:56:54.092]  Exactly.
[00:56:54.915 --> 00:56:58.756]  Yeah, there's two events which we need to watch out for for the rest of August.
[00:56:59.957 --> 00:57:10.360]  15th of August, there's a nuclear casualty drill in Hawaii, which drills a nuke going off and killing 10,000 people.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:20.803]  They always piggyback staged terror attacks on the back of government-run drills, so they can absolve themselves of culpability if any evidence leads back to them.
[00:57:20.843 --> 00:57:21.924]  It's all part of the drill.
[00:57:21.984 --> 00:57:22.844]  We weren't involved in it.
[00:57:23.598 --> 00:57:44.352]  So there's that in Hawaii, and then these wild-eyed neo-fascists and blackout evangelicals are saying that on August 22nd, Iran wants to initiate the return of the 12th Emon, or whatever the 14th Loch Ness Monster Bigfoot, that's how crazy it all is.
[00:57:44.492 --> 00:57:47.754]  And no one's saying that in Iran, we've looked into it, they're just making this up.
[00:57:48.555 --> 00:57:50.876]  Well, they don't have the capability.
[00:57:51.216 --> 00:57:53.378]  The CIA's own report said 10 years.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:59.682]  You know, their nuclear processing facilities have, by UN mandate, cameras lined up everywhere.
[00:57:59.702 --> 00:58:14.007]  So, if a nuke goes off in a major western city, or in Tel Aviv, as Fox News fear-mongered a couple of weeks ago on Haniyeh and Combs, then for sure it's the globalists, because Iran does not have the capability.
[00:58:14.047 --> 00:58:16.288]  So, Paul, I mean, just boil it down.
[00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:17.868]  You agree with my analysis.
[00:58:17.928 --> 00:58:21.649]  You think that, barring exposing what's happening, we're going to have an attack?
[00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:23.170]  Or do you think it's not that bad?
[00:58:24.452 --> 00:58:27.213]  I think if we double our efforts, we can prevent it.
[00:58:27.233 --> 00:58:29.813]  They'll just ramp out more fake terror alerts.
[00:58:30.233 --> 00:58:32.374]  If we lay back, they'll go ahead and launch it.
[00:58:33.434 --> 00:58:33.774]  I agree.
[00:58:33.814 --> 00:58:37.415]  They're seeing if Bush's approval rating goes up, which it is, and that's another sign they're going to do it.
[00:58:37.695 --> 00:58:38.615]  Thank you, Paul Watson.
[00:58:38.635 --> 00:58:39.095]  We'll be back.
[00:58:41.416 --> 00:58:45.936]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:02.152]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.812 --> 00:59:03.613]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.373 --> 00:59:05.293]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.954 --> 00:59:09.675]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.136 --> 00:59:14.258]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:25.283]  I want to be clear, you've got real evangelical Christians that are a huge part of this broadcast, and I myself am a Christian.
[00:59:26.067 --> 00:59:32.052]  Southern Baptist type, who know about the New World Order and the bedrock fighting it.
[00:59:32.132 --> 00:59:41.440]  But when Paul Watson said he's a wacko evangelist, I mean, they really do believe that Iran is the Antichrist and they're about to start World War...
[00:59:42.429 --> 00:59:43.570]  Three on the 22nd.
[00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:45.491]  The Wall Street Journal started this rumor.
[00:59:45.851 --> 01:00:01.720]  I have the Wall Street Journal article here in the stack, and the Wall Street Journal professor that put this out said, well, that's a limited sect that believed this a thousand years ago, and I found these texts, and according to my calculations, this is the date
[01:00:02.902 --> 01:00:08.024]  And really, it's as if they're putting out some new prophecy, hoping Muslims pick it up.
[01:00:08.064 --> 01:00:10.025]  And there are a bunch of crazy Muslims in the world.
[01:00:10.045 --> 01:00:12.326]  You know, you've got a billion, three hundred million people.
[01:00:13.066 --> 01:00:14.947]  You're going to have some nuts in there, and there are.
[01:00:15.347 --> 01:00:16.828]  They'll probably pick up on it now.
[01:00:16.888 --> 01:00:20.269]  I mean, it's just this self-fulfilling prophecy baloney.
[01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:28.501]  You add that into the mix, so the Globals are trying to say Iran, August 22nd is going to blow up the planet, basically start Armageddon.
[01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.605]  And I don't think it'll be Iran, ladies and gentlemen, if something happens.
[01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:32.867]  Understand, I'm not saying this.
[01:00:33.308 --> 01:00:36.393]  Fox News has got experts on every night saying we will be nuked.
[01:00:36.813 --> 01:00:38.134]  The White House has told U.S.
[01:00:38.174 --> 01:00:39.835]  News and World Report we will be nuked.
[01:00:40.276 --> 01:00:42.397]  It's all over the media that we're going to be hit.
[01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:43.718]  We've got to have World War III.
[01:00:43.758 --> 01:00:46.100]  And Newt Gingrich is saying, we've got to attack Iran!
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:46.880]  They're about to hit us!
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.041]  We've got to have World War III!
[01:00:48.121 --> 01:00:48.782]  Oh, no!
[01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:51.864]  I mean, you can really see them with the propaganda.
[01:00:52.784 --> 01:00:57.768]  And now, this huge fake terror alert and these busts of Patsy's or whatever they are.
[01:00:57.868 --> 01:00:59.409]  You know it's going to follow the MO of the past.
[01:00:59.629 --> 01:01:00.390]  It always comes out.
[01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:01.470]  It's like 50-something times.
[01:01:02.251 --> 01:01:03.492]  So, that's why I'm saying,
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:07.881]  There's a bunch of other points, that it's all coming together.
[01:01:09.122 --> 01:01:28.429]  And the White House admittedly, in fact I'm telling my crew right now, I forgot to tell them during the break, go pull the article, I think it was about a year and a half, two years ago, it was Associated Press, and in it was a mainstream news article about the White House, got some focus groups,
[01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:50.092]  That's where they get people randomly off the street and bring them, and then these lobbyists and sociologists ask them questions, and they were trying to ascertain, I forget the exact headline, it was in a bunch of newspapers, but AP was one of the newswires, that would the American people support the President more if there was another terror attack, or would they be angry because the President couldn't protect them?
[01:01:51.953 --> 01:01:56.996]  So, right there, they are studying it, and this is a beta test.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:10.224]  If Bush's approval rating goes up off of this big fake terror alert, it will only encourage him to have more fake terror alerts and more fake busts or a real event.
[01:02:11.625 --> 01:02:14.446]  So again, key word here is Nexus Point.
[01:02:15.026 --> 01:02:17.007]  All these different lines are intersecting.
[01:02:17.327 --> 01:02:22.669]  We're getting more chatter, more propaganda, more war provocation, more hype right now
[01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:28.272]  And we have seen, even before 9-11, there was a big ramp up to 9-11.
[01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:29.072]  Here's Bin Laden.
[01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:30.233]  He's going to get you soon.
[01:02:30.253 --> 01:02:32.013]  There's going to be a terror attack.
[01:02:32.133 --> 01:02:34.234]  When there's a terror attack, you give your rights up.
[01:02:34.554 --> 01:02:36.074]  Now repeat after me, America.
[01:02:36.154 --> 01:02:37.774]  What do you do if there's a terror attack?
[01:02:38.275 --> 01:02:40.035]  We give our rights up!
[01:02:40.435 --> 01:02:40.835]  Good.
[01:02:40.915 --> 01:02:42.216]  Let's repeat that now.
[01:02:43.576 --> 01:02:48.037]  So I saw all these indicators and I went on air and I said, they'll probably attack the World Trade Center.
[01:02:48.217 --> 01:02:49.758]  These criminals return to the scene of the crime.
[01:02:50.038 --> 01:02:51.258]  They repeat themselves.
[01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:59.374]  It's a type of psychosis and they're going to probably attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset Bin Laden.
[01:03:00.696 --> 01:03:02.737]  Now, call the White House and tell them don't do it.
[01:03:03.898 --> 01:03:10.543]  Well, now I'm telling you again that I'm seeing even more indicators, more nexus points than I saw then.
[01:03:13.965 --> 01:03:18.388]  It's getting really out of control, and I'm really concerned about this.
[01:03:18.468 --> 01:03:34.937]  So, we've got to get maximum attention on all 9-11 Truth events, whether they're in Dallas coming up the 26th of this month, or in early September in areas of the East Coast like Philadelphia, and on September 10th in New York.
[01:03:37.419 --> 01:03:39.900]  All these events, wherever you are, you've got to have your own events.
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.001]  We've got to have marches.
[01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:42.622]  We've got to get aggressive.
[01:03:43.425 --> 01:03:44.485]  We've got to get out there.
[01:03:44.505 --> 01:03:46.486]  We've got to call in to talk radio shows.
[01:03:46.966 --> 01:03:48.066]  We've got to do it now.
[01:03:48.286 --> 01:03:48.906]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:57.268]  It's here.
[01:03:57.448 --> 01:04:02.249]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.609 --> 01:04:10.230]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:17.993]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.394 --> 01:04:29.839]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.119 --> 01:04:33.641]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.101 --> 01:04:36.022]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.362 --> 01:04:40.124]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:57.002]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:57.022 --> 01:05:01.064]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:01.204 --> 01:05:03.765]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.826 --> 01:05:06.147]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.347 --> 01:05:14.771]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:14.851 --> 01:05:16.152]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:19.514]  Water molecules take minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:19.514 --> 01:05:20.014]  We're good to go!

[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:00.265]  United States Pharmacopeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[01:06:00.465 --> 01:06:03.467]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[01:06:03.608 --> 01:06:06.930]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:07.791]  We're good to go!
[01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:39.774]  Since we are of nature, we should eat foods in their natural form.
[01:06:40.114 --> 01:06:44.215]  Only Grown by Nature offers a full line of re-natured nutrients.

[01:06:45.395 --> 01:06:51.217]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[01:06:54.958 --> 01:07:00.980]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.581]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.483 --> 01:07:12.427]  I was asked by Tom Martino on National Radio today why I think every terror attacks the government.
[01:07:13.528 --> 01:07:15.349]  Well, it's because I have official U.S.
[01:07:15.369 --> 01:07:23.574]  government and British and Israeli documents and mainstream news stories where almost every event in modern history has been staged by our governments.
[01:07:24.324 --> 01:07:49.198]  Going back to 1953, Kermit Roosevelt and an 11-man team of British and CIA officers from the U.S., MI6 and CIA, staged terror attacks with what they had like 20 million dollars all over Iran, blew up mosques, bombed schools, shot crowds of kids, attacked religious leaders, imams, and the people were pretty naive back then like Americans are today.
[01:07:49.258 --> 01:07:50.739]  They're not too naive over there now though.
[01:07:51.716 --> 01:07:56.760]  And they overthrew Mozadek and cut most of his cabinet's heads off and imprisoned him for life.
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.302]  And they brag about it and it's declassified.
[01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:08.848]  And Kermit Roosevelt tells Tim Downing Street, that's who he reported to first, the bosses, then to President Eisenhower, that this works absolutely wonderfully.
[01:08:08.888 --> 01:08:10.389]  You can go read his after-action reports.
[01:08:10.790 --> 01:08:14.772]  Just type Kermit Roosevelt, Project Ajax, after-action report.
[01:08:14.792 --> 01:08:15.953]  You'll be at CIA.gov.
[01:08:16.073 --> 01:08:16.834]  They're very proud of it.
[01:08:17.817 --> 01:08:19.979]  And he just says, this works wonderfully, we should do this.
[01:08:20.079 --> 01:08:21.560]  And so they did it hundreds of times.
[01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:23.942]  And many of those have been declassified.
[01:08:24.762 --> 01:08:28.365]  And they have all these fake terror alerts that we tried to chronicle last hour.
[01:08:28.385 --> 01:08:29.386]  There's over 50 of them.
[01:08:30.087 --> 01:08:32.528]  And all these top experts saying these are staged alerts.
[01:08:32.548 --> 01:08:37.852]  And then they have the provocateur types, where they literally go find people who are on welfare, who are mentally retarded.
[01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:40.915]  In almost every case, these are mentally retarded people.
[01:08:41.575 --> 01:08:45.558]  They could be Christian, Rastafarian, black street kids in Florida.
[01:08:45.618 --> 01:08:46.319]  It doesn't matter.
[01:08:47.777 --> 01:08:50.579]  And the leaders, the founders of the groups are FBI.
[01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:54.421]  And for years, it may take years, they get them to shoot their mouths off.
[01:08:55.241 --> 01:08:56.062]  And then they finally do.
[01:08:56.242 --> 01:09:01.845]  It's like the Texas Monthly in 98 gave a bum steer award to the FBI.
[01:09:01.865 --> 01:09:02.606]  That's a big insult.
[01:09:03.466 --> 01:09:05.887]  They won first place for creating a Klan group.
[01:09:05.927 --> 01:09:07.208]  They couldn't find a Klan group.
[01:09:07.548 --> 01:09:10.410]  They went and led and created one and tried to get them to blow up a chemical plant.
[01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:14.272]  They were so stupid that they couldn't even load firearms.
[01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:17.454]  And so the FBI finally just got them to shoot their mouths off and busted them.
[01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:22.884]  And they weren't on welfare and registered retarded.
[01:09:22.904 --> 01:09:23.804]  They were just on welfare.
[01:09:24.184 --> 01:09:26.846]  But basically, you hear them describe in the article, they were retarded.
[01:09:28.186 --> 01:09:29.407]  So it's the same story.
[01:09:29.787 --> 01:09:32.668]  And the cops that do this, do this because they all get promotions.
[01:09:32.708 --> 01:09:36.370]  They go from $50,000 a year to $80,000 a year to $100,000 a year.
[01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:38.190]  I mean, this is how these guys make money.
[01:09:39.151 --> 01:09:40.491]  It's like before they go into Waco.
[01:09:40.511 --> 01:09:44.793]  We got the BATF on tape, loading their cameras, going, man, this is going to be great for funding.
[01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.174]  We're going to get a lot of funding out of this.
[01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.926]  You go out and find people, call them kooks, kill them, make some money.
[01:09:51.727 --> 01:09:59.551]  And I'm ranting here, ladies and gentlemen, it's just that do you understand that even Ray McGovern, senior CIA analyst, said the evidence is clear?
[01:10:00.211 --> 01:10:01.392]  Witnesses, even U.S.
[01:10:01.432 --> 01:10:02.452]  troops, saw other U.S.
[01:10:02.492 --> 01:10:09.396]  troops and Iraqis and British go into that mosque earlier this year and blow it up to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other.
[01:10:09.416 --> 01:10:14.018]  Do you understand they've caught Israelis shooting Marines dressed up like Arabs with big beards?
[01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:24.595]  Do you understand they have caught British Special Air Services shooting and killing and bombing the elected government advisory to blame it on different religious sects?
[01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:30.933]  So, yeah, of course we think this newest thing in England stays, because it fits the same M.O.
[01:10:31.133 --> 01:10:32.474]  Do they provocateur it?
[01:10:32.534 --> 01:10:33.314]  Is it a frame-up?
[01:10:33.714 --> 01:10:34.654]  Is it entrapment?
[01:10:35.035 --> 01:10:37.255]  Or is, in most cases, it just totally made up?
[01:10:37.295 --> 01:10:39.476]  They're now arresting some pregnant woman.
[01:10:39.516 --> 01:10:40.656]  She's the top terrorist.
[01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:42.697]  Some eight-month pregnant woman.
[01:10:43.797 --> 01:10:44.677]  It's disgusting.
[01:10:44.797 --> 01:10:47.178]  Alright, Darjeeling is an American.
[01:10:48.246 --> 01:10:51.228]  And he has a Lebanese descent and he has family in Lebanon.
[01:10:51.268 --> 01:10:51.588]  He was there.
[01:10:51.608 --> 01:10:52.548]  He was on the front lines.
[01:10:52.888 --> 01:10:54.529]  He was there in Kwana that got bombed.
[01:10:54.549 --> 01:10:56.210]  The big massacre.
[01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.331]  And he was over there for three weeks or so.
[01:10:58.351 --> 01:10:59.592]  He just got back a few days ago.
[01:10:59.992 --> 01:11:00.592]  And he joins us.
[01:11:00.612 --> 01:11:05.254]  But before we get into what's really happening over there in the escalation, this is pretty clear, Dar.
[01:11:05.774 --> 01:11:06.815]  They want World War III.
[01:11:06.835 --> 01:11:07.715]  They're calling for it.
[01:11:07.735 --> 01:11:08.796]  They're hyping it right now.
[01:11:09.685 --> 01:11:15.290]  And now we see they're saying that Iran plans to start Armageddon on the 22nd.
[01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:18.512]  Totally made up, but the Wall Street Journal is putting this out.
[01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:24.937]  And we've got the media saying Hezbollah is about to start attacking the U.S.
[01:11:24.957 --> 01:11:26.859]  This looks like the kickoff of World War III, Dark.
[01:11:27.808 --> 01:11:53.116]  Well, I think that's exactly their goal, and I'm really glad that you just said what you did about this recent so-called terrorist plot to really keep everybody on edge, test the waters for what is to come, because I think as bad as things are out here in this country and as bad as they are in the Middle East right now, they're certainly going to need to stage another big event or have something happening here on our home soil before they can go into Iran, but I think
[01:11:53.653 --> 01:12:00.355]  After seeing what I've seen Israel do in Lebanon and continue to do, I certainly wouldn't put anything past them at this point.
[01:12:00.955 --> 01:12:02.236]  Well, I've looked at all the numbers.
[01:12:02.296 --> 01:12:03.996]  I've looked at the past history.
[01:12:04.016 --> 01:12:05.156]  I've looked at what they need.
[01:12:05.617 --> 01:12:10.078]  They're not going to be able to go into Syria or Iran, barring a big attack here in the U.S.
[01:12:10.138 --> 01:12:10.598]  or England.
[01:12:10.918 --> 01:12:15.700]  And, Dar, I see the nexus, all the things coming together, like I saw right before 9-11.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.901]  I see the gleam in Bush and other people's eyes.
[01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:20.261]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:12:21.326 --> 01:12:22.967]  Well, it's really hard to say.
[01:12:22.987 --> 01:12:27.108]  I mean, I've kind of given up trying to predict these people because they're absolute lunatics.
[01:12:27.208 --> 01:12:32.150]  It'd be like going into an insane asylum and trying to predict what certain people are going to do.
[01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:33.551]  I mean, who knows?
[01:12:33.651 --> 01:12:35.671]  Because these people are capable of anything.
[01:12:35.731 --> 01:12:36.912]  You know that, I know that.
[01:12:37.432 --> 01:12:41.473]  And I think the question is really just when is it going to happen, but not if.
[01:12:43.154 --> 01:12:45.355]  Well, I think it's going to happen before the end of October.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.142]  I think, first, I've been talking with people about this recently.
[01:12:51.162 --> 01:13:02.789]  People consistently ask me, when is Syria going to be dragged into this, which means, when is Iran going to be dragged into this, which means massive aerial bombardment of Iran and possibly the kickoff of World War III.
[01:13:02.829 --> 01:13:09.172]  And I think that it is certainly a matter of, I think before the end of the year, Syria will be drugged into this.
[01:13:09.648 --> 01:13:13.109]  Well, Israel is openly saying they may go ahead and hit Iran any day.
[01:13:13.149 --> 01:13:20.092]  They've been delivered, what is it, 250 plus huge bunker busters, the reports are, may even have nukes in them.
[01:13:20.112 --> 01:13:22.913]  They're openly saying they've got 400 to 600 nukes.
[01:13:23.253 --> 01:13:25.534]  They're openly talking about hitting Iran or Syria.
[01:13:26.254 --> 01:13:27.775]  They're calling up more and more military.
[01:13:27.795 --> 01:13:29.975]  They're clearly moving in to stay in Lebanon.
[01:13:30.636 --> 01:13:32.036]  Let's shift gears into Lebanon.
[01:13:33.036 --> 01:13:37.258]  What did you witness, kind of in a thumbnail sketch, while you were there, and what do you see happening in the future?
[01:13:38.112 --> 01:13:53.223]  Well, the thumbnail sketch of what I saw is completely indiscriminate attacks on civilian population of Lebanon, not just southern Lebanon, but in the entire country, even just yesterday on the northern border of Lebanon, Abu Dhabi border station, which is how I went in.
[01:13:54.444 --> 01:13:55.044]  It was bombed.
[01:13:55.084 --> 01:13:59.367]  The border station was bombed and 11 people were killed and at least 11 more wounded.
[01:13:59.467 --> 01:14:13.198]  This is the same day they dropped leaflets up north saying that basically any car on the coastal road was going to be a legitimate target, especially if it was some kind of truck, which might be, according to them, transporting ammunition.
[01:14:13.278 --> 01:14:16.060]  But basically just widespread civilian carnage.
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:21.524]  They've killed well over a thousand Lebanese now, and at least 90% of those are civilians.
[01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:25.447]  Conversely, Hezbollah has killed approximately 100 Israelis.
[01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.489]  About 50% of those are soldiers.
[01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.551]  So, who is the terrorist organization?
[01:14:31.512 --> 01:14:36.897]  Well, Darg, last time I had you on, you know, Israel was saying, we'll just be there a few more weeks.
[01:14:36.917 --> 01:14:38.679]  Now they're saying another month, maybe two months.
[01:14:39.319 --> 01:14:42.822]  Now they're openly discussing going all the way to the border with Syria.
[01:14:42.862 --> 01:14:46.085]  They're continually bombing right up against the border of Syria.
[01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:52.396]  I mean it's clear they're trying to escalate or elicit some type of response from Syria.
[01:14:52.416 --> 01:14:57.684]  Syria is saying that they may have to come in on the war if any of their property or territory is touched.
[01:14:58.425 --> 01:14:59.647]  How do you see this shaking out?
[01:15:00.652 --> 01:15:13.663]  I do, and you and I both know that it's key to watch what they do and don't listen to the nonsense, the lies, the propaganda that they spout, because, yeah, let's have another few weeks, we have to finish the job, etc., etc.
[01:15:13.903 --> 01:15:28.135]  But look at the fact that they have tens of thousands of troops already in Lebanon, they're trying to push further each day, they're pulling up more to bring in, it doesn't matter the fact that the President of Israel, Ehud Olmert's approval rating is down to 38%, his defense
[01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:30.376]  I don't think so.
[01:15:51.568 --> 01:16:00.560]  For longer than another couple of months, because I, like you, I really think it's just a matter of possibly even weeks before Israel does whatever it takes to drag Syria, i.e.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:01.521]  Iran, into this.
[01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:03.071]  A provocation.
[01:16:03.231 --> 01:16:07.453]  Oh, our bomb went up two miles over the border and blew up that school on accident.
[01:16:08.033 --> 01:16:10.114]  And of course, Syria has its countrymen.
[01:16:10.594 --> 01:16:14.856]  The population is angry at the government, wanting to militarily strike Israel.
[01:16:16.236 --> 01:16:21.238]  Really, Lebanon has historically been basically part of Syria, or under its dominion.
[01:16:21.838 --> 01:16:25.100]  Refugees have been trying to flood into Syria, putting pressure on it.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:28.221]  The Lebanese had just gotten the Syrians out in the last year.
[01:16:29.101 --> 01:16:32.223]  Well, I haven't seen the recent ones, but past documents, including what some of the
[01:16:48.064 --> 01:16:56.991]  Leaders of the Zionists in Israel, as well as their own military there in Israel, have been saying that they're very keen to get back into southern Lebanon.
[01:16:57.051 --> 01:16:57.712]  And it is that.
[01:16:57.792 --> 01:17:01.455]  A lot of it so much is about, as you well know, is about the Lakani River.
[01:17:01.475 --> 01:17:03.176]  It's about the freshwater resources.
[01:17:03.516 --> 01:17:04.657]  They have to have that.
[01:17:04.898 --> 01:17:10.422]  They're already at about maximum capacity with their water, even after stealing the water of the Palestinians.
[01:17:10.482 --> 01:17:13.885]  And so I think it's important that people remember this isn't just about oil.
[01:17:13.925 --> 01:17:15.406]  This isn't just about Zionists.
[01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:24.194]  Now, most Americans don't even know what a Zionist is.
[01:17:24.214 --> 01:17:27.415]  30% don't even know what year 9-11 happened.
[01:17:28.275 --> 01:17:31.896]  So for those that don't know, Dar, why don't you briefly describe what the Zionists are?
[01:17:32.868 --> 01:17:45.072]  Well, basically the rough description is that the Zionist movement are full of people that believe it's their God-given right to populate the land around Israel.
[01:17:45.092 --> 01:17:54.035]  They believe, even though in the Bible Israel is simply a mindset, it's not actually a physical place, the Zionists, their radical movement, they've taken this
[01:17:54.495 --> 01:18:09.769]  Well, they openly say that Saudi Arabia, Egypt, I mean the entire region is, in the Bible it's clearly that area right there around Jerusalem, but now it's been turned into the Middle East.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:23.663]  Right, and that's why we, you know, just to give you some people, some hard examples, is the settlers, for example, they call them settlers, they're actually colonists, who are being given M-16s in houses and Palestinian land.
[01:18:24.043 --> 01:18:35.665]  They're trying to expand their territory, and it is a land grab, and that is the primary example of what the... Well, really, it's like Hitler, when he went into Poland, he said, we need living space, Lebensraum.
[01:18:36.985 --> 01:18:38.227]  It is similar to that.
[01:18:38.527 --> 01:18:40.150]  Yeah, we'll be right back with Darja Maul.
[01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:50.927]  I want to get some of the eyewitness accounts for me, some of the things you witnessed, the level of carnage, the smoking cities, the plumes of black smoke, and we'll get back into government-sponsored terror.
[01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:56.148]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:18:56.188 --> 01:18:56.688]  are located?

[01:21:08.778 --> 01:21:17.463]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:21:18.264 --> 01:21:23.587]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[01:21:23.607 --> 01:21:31.712]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:32.492 --> 01:21:32.972]  Just call 1-800
[01:21:34.633 --> 01:21:34.953]  516-8736.
[01:21:35.014 --> 01:21:35.354]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:35.394 --> 01:21:36.696]  It's absolutely free.
[01:21:36.716 --> 01:21:39.139]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:21:39.159 --> 01:21:39.740]  Just call right now.
[01:21:51.832 --> 01:21:54.713]  So Janice, where are you and Jim going on vacation this summer?
[01:21:54.913 --> 01:21:58.775]  Definitely somewhere with a beach, though who knows if our feet will even touch the sand.
[01:21:58.975 --> 01:22:02.717]  That reminds me Janice, have you figured out how to talk to Jim about his problem?
[01:22:02.837 --> 01:22:05.738]  No, I want to, but men can be so sensitive.
[01:22:05.918 --> 01:22:07.299]  Well it's only going to get worse.
[01:22:07.579 --> 01:22:09.640]  Remember I was going through the same thing with Dan.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.561]  Then I found mycoside NS.
[01:22:11.781 --> 01:22:12.942]  What's mycoside NS?
[01:22:13.282 --> 01:22:16.583]  Mycoside NS kills the germs that can cause fungal infections.
[01:22:16.843 --> 01:22:18.044]  It works great for Dan.
[01:22:18.204 --> 01:22:20.225]  He had the worst looking, thick yellow toenails.
[01:22:20.465 --> 01:22:22.186]  Now his nails look clear and healthy.
[01:22:22.306 --> 01:22:23.286]  Do I need a prescription?
[01:22:23.566 --> 01:22:23.726]  No.
[01:22:23.766 --> 01:22:29.248]  You can get Mycoside NS anti-fungal treatment in the foot care aisle at any drug store or major retailer.
[01:22:29.368 --> 01:22:30.469]  And it really worked?
[01:22:30.489 --> 01:22:32.130]  Yep, it worked on me too.
[01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:34.350]  I had some white discolorations on my toe.
[01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:36.511]  I just applied Mycoside NS daily.
[01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:38.392]  I didn't even have to remove my nail polish.
[01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:39.392]  Sounds easy.
[01:22:39.552 --> 01:22:41.333]  I can start planning our beach getaway.
[01:22:41.353 --> 01:22:45.814]  Yeah, Micocide definitely gave us the confidence to bare our feet again.
[01:22:46.055 --> 01:22:49.036]  Pick up Micocide NS at drugstores and major retailers.
[01:22:49.136 --> 01:22:51.096]  Look for a free bonus gift in each box.
[01:22:55.358 --> 01:22:55.878]  Don't worry.
[01:22:56.318 --> 01:22:57.879]  This show is documented.
[01:22:58.359 --> 01:23:01.660]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.621]  Darja Maul's our guest.
[01:23:06.015 --> 01:23:09.036]  We're going to have open phones coming up later in this hour.
[01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:24.680]  Dar, I'm sure you've read it, William Crystal, Newt Gingrich, really 30 or 40 of them have been all over radio, TV, newsprint saying, this is World War III, we need to totally attack the Arabs.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:29.441]  There's open discussions on Fox News about lining up all the Arabs and quote, killing them.
[01:23:30.341 --> 01:23:32.241]  I mean, this is really psycho talk.
[01:23:32.281 --> 01:23:34.202]  The Arabs, they claim talk like this.
[01:23:35.237 --> 01:23:36.758]  Well, that's actually what I've been telling people.
[01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:41.182]  I've already started doing presentations since I just got back, and that's what I'm doing up here in Seattle.
[01:24:01.775 --> 01:24:02.895]  That's their message.
[01:24:02.915 --> 01:24:05.616]  That's the main message I'm trying to impress upon people.
[01:24:05.976 --> 01:24:11.418]  That these people, the Bush so-called administration, the people backing them are absolute lunatics.
[01:24:11.478 --> 01:24:12.779]  They want World War III.
[01:24:12.819 --> 01:24:14.119]  They want Armageddon.
[01:24:14.159 --> 01:24:15.499]  They believe in the Rapture.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:20.201]  And we're like probably one big step away from having that happen.
[01:24:20.958 --> 01:24:28.283]  It's total lunacy, and if anyone's been thinking of taking the next step to try to do something to stop these people, now is that time.
[01:24:28.323 --> 01:24:29.324]  Well, that's the incredible thing.
[01:24:29.344 --> 01:24:43.473]  I mean, Bush and others are cynical manipulators of a large block of evangelical Christians that have been given a false doctrine, but they're the ones then claiming that Ahmedinejad wants Armageddon, and he hasn't said that anywhere!
[01:24:43.753 --> 01:24:44.913]  He's not saying that!
[01:24:44.994 --> 01:24:46.174]  It's made up!
[01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:47.135]  It's incredible!
[01:24:48.132 --> 01:24:52.233]  It absolutely is, just like what you said, this demonization of Arabs.
[01:24:52.733 --> 01:25:02.315]  For example, I was reading a story in the newspaper this morning about this so-called terrorist plot that they just foiled in Britain, saying that all 19 people had Muslim names.
[01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:05.235]  So, what does that mean if John Smith is a Muslim?
[01:25:05.455 --> 01:25:07.195]  Is that a Muslim name?
[01:25:07.255 --> 01:25:09.776]  I mean, this is the kind of thinking these people are using.
[01:25:09.816 --> 01:25:15.417]  It shows the ignorance of even the journalists that they don't understand that Muslim has nothing to do with a name.
[01:25:16.147 --> 01:25:34.288]  Exactly, as well as the ignorance to assume that most of the population have, and that's why it's so important that people get the right information and really understand that these people are lunatics, they're hell-bent on destroying the world and bringing this Armageddon about, and that is their agenda, and they're pretty close to pulling it off, and that's what people need to understand.
[01:25:35.194 --> 01:25:35.855]  You were there.
[01:25:35.935 --> 01:25:41.360]  I want to go over some of the carnage you witnessed in the different cities that were hit.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:49.888]  I mean, every day we see the video footage of just smoking rubble, satellite photos of whole areas of Beirut leveled.
[01:25:50.609 --> 01:25:51.810]  What does Beirut look like?
[01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:54.032]  What does the southern area, what does the north look like?
[01:25:54.699 --> 01:25:56.601]  Well, they're hitting more and more areas of Beirut.
[01:25:56.661 --> 01:26:02.926]  As you said, the Dakhia District, the southern suburbs of the southern area of Beirut City is basically gone.
[01:26:02.946 --> 01:26:10.213]  It's like the faster pictures of Fallujah, that what buildings are left standing are certainly not livable at this point.
[01:26:10.233 --> 01:26:13.236]  Then you get into southern Lebanon, and parts of it look like the moon.
[01:26:13.316 --> 01:26:19.021]  It's just one bomb crater after another, oftentimes with civilian cars in the bottoms of them or ambulances.
[01:26:19.605 --> 01:26:22.547]  I want to talk a lot about the policy I saw.
[01:26:22.807 --> 01:26:31.192]  What I saw was a very clear pattern that what the Israelis are doing is pamphleting villages, telling people to leave after they've been bombed in their homes for several weeks.
[01:26:31.472 --> 01:26:37.236]  And when people follow the instructions, get in their cars and fly white surrender flags and try to flee, they're hitting the cars.
[01:26:37.596 --> 01:26:41.939]  And then when people with the Red Cross try to come rescue those cars, they're hitting the Red Cross.
[01:26:42.386 --> 01:26:45.651]  That's the pattern that I saw over and over in the weeks that I reported there.
[01:26:45.931 --> 01:26:52.300]  And if that is incomparable to what we saw Hitler doing against the Jews themselves during World War II, I don't know what is.
[01:26:53.715 --> 01:26:58.277]  Well, the Israelis have said that every time one of their troops get killed, they're going to kill at least 10 civilians.
[01:26:58.617 --> 01:26:59.917]  That's what the Nazis would do.
[01:26:59.957 --> 01:27:02.818]  If an SS man got shot, they would kill 100 people.
[01:27:02.838 --> 01:27:05.319]  If a regular military man got shot, they would kill 10.
[01:27:05.539 --> 01:27:09.881]  And in some cases, if a big officer got killed, they'd put 400, 500 people.
[01:27:10.341 --> 01:27:13.182]  In one case, it was almost 500 in a barn and burn it down.
[01:27:13.862 --> 01:27:14.882]  And folks, it's on record.
[01:27:14.902 --> 01:27:19.084]  The UN says, please don't bomb us, so they shoot a precision-guided missile into it.
[01:27:20.864 --> 01:27:23.647]  So it's just a repeat of this, and they tell them, flee!
[01:27:23.928 --> 01:27:27.913]  They flee, they bomb the convoys, they blow up the bridges, so they can't flee.
[01:27:27.933 --> 01:27:30.136]  This is just so cynical!
[01:27:31.269 --> 01:27:31.990]  Well, it really is.
[01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:40.619]  I mean, really, it's only one step away from putting them in trains and shipping them off to be incinerated in chambers like Hitler did.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:46.565]  Except now they're using technology so they can bypass the trains and just incinerate people in their homes.
[01:27:46.585 --> 01:27:48.507]  And that's what I saw repeatedly.
[01:27:48.527 --> 01:27:51.150]  Ghana is really the prime example.
[01:27:52.222 --> 01:27:59.544]  There's countless Qanas where people are massacred, hiding in their homes, except they don't get the press attention because it's not six people in one go.
[01:27:59.884 --> 01:28:02.125]  Instead, it's five and ten people in one go.
[01:28:02.425 --> 01:28:04.966]  And this is what Southern Lebanon has turned into.
[01:28:04.986 --> 01:28:10.308]  This is why there's over a million people of this 3.8 million populated country now displayed.
[01:28:10.468 --> 01:28:11.288]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:28:11.328 --> 01:28:19.831]  The UN positions and the observer positions have been bombarded, and everybody's trying to flee, so very few brave people like yourself
[01:28:20.764 --> 01:28:21.925]  Dar Jamal have gone down there.
[01:28:21.985 --> 01:28:22.506]  Stay there, Dar.
[01:28:22.526 --> 01:28:30.632]  I want to do five more minutes on the other side, just to finish up what you witnessed while you were there in the three weeks that you were in Lebanon, because this is so important.
[01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.594]  But, yeah, I mean, it's much worse.
[01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:35.476]  Mainstream media is saying a thousand dead civilians now.
[01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.199]  Folks, it's much higher than that.
[01:28:38.219 --> 01:28:38.899]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:42.662 --> 01:28:43.543]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.043 --> 01:28:45.645]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.566 --> 01:28:49.248]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:58.805]  September 11, 2001 changed the world, and the world is now realizing that the official story of that infamous day just doesn't make sense.
[01:28:59.105 --> 01:29:03.489]  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that there is a government cover-up, according to a CNN poll.
[01:29:03.509 --> 01:29:12.575]  9-11 In Plain Sight, the director's cut, is a compilation of unaltered news footage and photos from major networks and publications that raises questions that officials dare not ask, let alone answer.
[01:29:12.935 --> 01:29:20.861]  The worldwide firestorm of questions raised has forced some into a position of desperation damage control to keep this documentary from being seen or accepted by the masses.
[01:29:21.401 --> 01:29:26.063]  Why have these efforts been made to keep you from seeing this documentary and simply asking common sense questions?
[01:29:26.344 --> 01:29:26.724]  Find out.
[01:29:26.984 --> 01:29:31.306]  You must see 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut and share it with as many people as possible.
[01:29:31.646 --> 01:29:34.828]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your copy.
[01:29:35.088 --> 01:29:36.608]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:42.271]  Unless these questions are answered honestly, the world could be plunged into a third world war.
[01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:43.252]  Stop this madness.
[01:29:43.272 --> 01:29:45.373]  Call 877-817-9829 today and order your copy of 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut.
[01:29:54.204 --> 01:29:58.706]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:29:59.046 --> 01:30:03.148]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:30:03.428 --> 01:30:03.968]  We listened.
[01:30:04.288 --> 01:30:09.270]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:10.031]  We listened.
[01:30:10.411 --> 01:30:13.452]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:30:13.872 --> 01:30:14.412]  We listened.
[01:30:14.873 --> 01:30:18.034]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:30:18.274 --> 01:30:18.834]  We're good to go.
[01:30:48.234 --> 01:30:49.318]  Forkywater.com.
[01:30:49.679 --> 01:30:50.884]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.996 --> 01:30:58.158]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:30:58.378 --> 01:31:00.159]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:31:00.419 --> 01:31:06.762]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:13.245]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.485 --> 01:31:20.969]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:31:21.349 --> 01:31:24.191]  Now available is the 2006 Biosolutions Plus.
[01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:28.453]  The Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:31:28.613 --> 01:31:32.175]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:31:32.475 --> 01:31:36.217]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:38.958]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:39.098 --> 01:31:41.499]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[01:32:01.954 --> 01:32:09.863]  Dar Jamal is our guest, an American of Lebanese descent, Christian Lebanese, over there witnessing the untold horror in Lebanon.
[01:32:10.304 --> 01:32:12.046]  Speaking of Christian Lebanese, Dar,
[01:32:13.254 --> 01:32:17.276]  A large portion, what, 30-35% of the population in Lebanon.
[01:32:18.396 --> 01:32:21.298]  What has been their response to the carnage?
[01:32:21.318 --> 01:32:33.583]  Because I know a lot of Christians have been killed as well, and I know that Hezbollah didn't have a lot of support in the country, but now is, I've seen in polls, and I want to know if this is accurate, 80% support now by the Lebanese people.
[01:32:34.597 --> 01:32:38.840]  No, actually, it's up over 90% now, support by the Lebanese people.
[01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:39.901]  Also, it's grown now.
[01:32:40.342 --> 01:32:41.242]  It's well over 90%.
[01:32:41.503 --> 01:32:45.766]  Yeah, that statistic was a little bit old, and it's well over 90% now.
[01:32:45.826 --> 01:32:58.156]  And also, the Christian population over there, and I can say this because my cousins personally, that I know personally, of course, are Christian, and they have historically been vehemently against
[01:32:58.516 --> 01:32:58.897]  Thank you.
[01:33:15.066 --> 01:33:23.894]  But when you really look at the plan, they just want to balkanize and break up the regions, and they thought they'd do that here as they've done in Iraq, but it looks like it's backfiring.
[01:33:23.954 --> 01:33:28.638]  Why did they replace three days ago that Israeli head of Northern Command with a new guy?
[01:33:28.678 --> 01:33:29.519]  What does that mean?
[01:33:30.119 --> 01:33:33.042]  They had called up 30,000, now they called up 10,000 more.
[01:33:33.342 --> 01:33:35.283]  Now they're saying they may call up 20,000 more.
[01:33:35.804 --> 01:33:39.427]  So if they're panicking from saying they need 30,000 to 40,000 to 50,000 to 60,000 troops now, where is all this leading?
[01:33:42.422 --> 01:33:44.624]  Well, it's leading to a permanent occupation.
[01:33:44.644 --> 01:33:48.027]  They're going to try to annex southern Lebanon is where this is going to end up.
[01:33:48.327 --> 01:33:56.354]  Don't look for any kind of a withdrawal, and I think we should continue to look for changing of the heads, just like we've seen so many times in the Bush administration.
[01:33:56.674 --> 01:34:04.180]  When one person starts to take too much heat and it looks like they'll be able to pin some responsibility on them for war crimes or other atrocities, they'll just change them out.
[01:34:06.972 --> 01:34:09.234]  Now, I had you on just a few weeks ago in Lebanon.
[01:34:09.274 --> 01:34:11.855]  You weren't sure if the Israelis were trying to grab the land.
[01:34:11.915 --> 01:34:13.376]  Now they're openly talking about it.
[01:34:14.436 --> 01:34:27.703]  This is going to go over like a lead balloon in the Middle East, because the Arabs, the Muslims, the Christians, the Zoroastrians over there, they have all read the Israeli papers where they say they're going to take over the whole region.
[01:34:28.083 --> 01:34:32.345]  And imagine, folks, if some foreign country was telling you, we're going to take you over,
[01:34:32.945 --> 01:34:42.511]  I mean, that's why the Arabs are always saying, okay, we'll wipe you off the map, and then our media takes it out of context and goes, look at them, for no reason, saying they'll wipe Israel off the map.
[01:34:43.512 --> 01:34:52.278]  Right, exactly, and that's another very important point, because there is massive shifting going on in the populations in the Middle East, although most of them are under puppets.
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.041]  Thank you.
[01:35:06.457 --> 01:35:22.587]  But that's part of the larger plan in P2OG, and going back to the Israeli doctrines of 83, is to actually stir the area up and get people to respond as a pretext for World War III, where then they will force our sons and daughters to go over there and fight and die.
[01:35:23.108 --> 01:35:25.429]  We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dead Americans, folks.
[01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:27.170]  This will be worse than World War II.
[01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:31.413]  To literally take the land away from hundreds of millions of people?
[01:35:31.733 --> 01:35:32.454]  It ain't gonna work!
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:42.751]  Well, I agree, and that is the goal, and I've seen some of the maps for what a new Middle East would look like, and it's just absolutely madness.
[01:35:42.791 --> 01:35:52.863]  People should really look up on the internet and see these proposed maps of what the new lines will look like, and it absolutely is not going to succeed, and they've certainly bitten off more than they can chew here.
[01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:58.555]  All right, well, Dar, just in closing, any other things that you witnessed?
[01:35:59.637 --> 01:36:06.205]  I mean, any ways to kind of describe in words for us the scene in Lebanon now, bombed from end to end?
[01:36:07.401 --> 01:36:23.274]  Well, one story I want to share is that you mentioned it earlier, that they're saying now even the government is admitting that over a thousand Lebanese people have been killed so far, and a ways back I did a story when they were admitting the number to be 400.
[01:36:24.335 --> 01:36:28.318]  And I did a story showing, no, it should be at least twice that, if not three times that.
[01:36:28.638 --> 01:36:40.227]  And I want to just repeat again, they're saying a thousand, and again, the number, we're looking at, even right now, just because of their inability to recover bodies, should be more like around two thousand dead.
[01:36:40.367 --> 01:36:46.812]  And as this continues, again, I just look to double that number, because they're simply unable to get in and get to these bodies.
[01:36:46.872 --> 01:36:49.254]  As you said, they've bombed so many roads and bridges.
[01:36:49.554 --> 01:36:51.816]  They're bombing ambulances when they go to collect people.
[01:36:51.876 --> 01:36:53.377]  So many bodies are under houses.
[01:36:57.622 --> 01:37:01.067]  Well, you drove into the middle of this just late last week.
[01:37:01.147 --> 01:37:04.091]  What was it like when you were driving along?
[01:37:04.111 --> 01:37:05.673]  What type of car were you in?
[01:37:05.693 --> 01:37:07.415]  Did you see explosions?
[01:37:07.695 --> 01:37:08.917]  Did you hear artillery?
[01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:09.578]  What was it like?
[01:37:10.188 --> 01:37:21.413]  Well, we were in a small car, because they're bombing anything from minibuses on up, and we were in southern Lebanon during that so-called 48-hour ceasefire, and I was watching jets bomb.
[01:37:21.433 --> 01:37:22.514]  There was no ceasefire.
[01:37:22.554 --> 01:37:24.575]  There was nothing like a ceasefire.
[01:37:24.595 --> 01:37:31.538]  I was at Kana, and they were bombing, and the bombs were getting so close, they were rattling the buildings, what were left of the buildings that we were standing near.
[01:37:32.038 --> 01:37:35.624]  They're using artillery, they're using ships to shell it from the sea.
[01:37:36.405 --> 01:37:37.947]  One destroyed home after another.
[01:37:38.027 --> 01:37:40.110]  Most of the villages are basically ghost towns.
[01:37:40.515 --> 01:37:47.398]  Although there's still elderly, disabled, and young children hiding in the basements of houses because they're too afraid to leave.
[01:37:47.798 --> 01:37:52.060]  And that's another reason why this atrocity is off the charts that we're seeing.
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:54.440]  A lot of these people that can't flee are the poor.
[01:37:54.921 --> 01:38:02.844]  And so there might be three telephones in a little village and they call a house that's empty and say, we're now going to grid bomb your area.
[01:38:02.964 --> 01:38:04.284]  Every home will be destroyed.
[01:38:04.584 --> 01:38:05.865]  You have twenty minutes to leave.
[01:38:06.245 --> 01:38:08.426]  And the phone just rings and then all of a sudden they just
[01:38:09.026 --> 01:38:10.427]  They just shell the houses.
[01:38:10.507 --> 01:38:11.488]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:38:11.908 --> 01:38:13.109]  Well, it's worse than that, Alex.
[01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:14.110]  There are no phones.
[01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:16.351]  Everyone I interviewed down there said the same thing.
[01:38:16.831 --> 01:38:22.455]  During the first week of their operations against Lebanon, they cut all the phones, all the landlines, all the mobiles.
[01:38:22.795 --> 01:38:25.417]  There is no phone access whatsoever down there.
[01:38:25.457 --> 01:38:26.978]  They just begin bombing villages.
[01:38:27.318 --> 01:38:30.240]  Maybe even they'll drop pamphlets, but we've already covered that.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.623]  That basically means we'll hit you in your cars when you leave.
[01:38:33.803 --> 01:38:38.446]  So they cynically get on the news and go, we're giving them each family a friendly call?
[01:38:39.548 --> 01:38:41.810]  Well, how dare you say we're hurting anybody?
[01:38:42.811 --> 01:38:49.877]  Right, well again, it's just recycled propaganda techniques that we've seen and that I've reported to you guys about what I've seen about in Iraq.
[01:38:50.017 --> 01:38:52.860]  How do you see, how do you see Syria coming into this?
[01:38:54.219 --> 01:38:57.282]  Well, I think they're doing their best, like Iran, to stay out of it.
[01:38:57.322 --> 01:39:01.605]  They're well aware of the plan, and they know that they can't bite the bait.
[01:39:01.665 --> 01:39:11.634]  But I think it's going to be something like what you said, that Israel will have to launch a provocative attack, maybe even bombing Damascus, which they've done before in a limited way.
[01:39:11.694 --> 01:39:19.420]  But I think they'll probably say, hey, we found a truck coming directly from Syria, so Damascus is a threat, and they'll bomb Damascus.
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.322]  And then to that, Syria would have to respond.
[01:39:23.254 --> 01:39:29.199]  Wow, and then people will say, how dare Syria, when their capital was bombed, respond?
[01:39:29.239 --> 01:39:30.960]  We've never seen evil at this level!
[01:39:32.502 --> 01:39:37.866]  Well, I tell you, this is a massive shut-up, and it's only going to hurt Muslims, it's only going to hurt Christians, it's only going to hurt Jews.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.025]  And it's just so sad to see this escalation.
[01:39:42.325 --> 01:39:45.229]  Dar Jamal, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:39:45.249 --> 01:39:47.392]  You've been inside Fallujah when it was being bombarded.
[01:39:47.432 --> 01:39:49.295]  Now you've been in Lebanon while it's being bombarded.
[01:39:49.635 --> 01:39:51.037]  You know where your family comes from.
[01:39:51.057 --> 01:39:53.461]  This is getting really close to home for you, isn't it?
[01:39:54.298 --> 01:39:55.019]  It really is.
[01:39:55.979 --> 01:40:10.031]  But at the same time, even though my ancestry is from Lebanon and still seeing the same thing in Iraq, because it was being done more directly by my own country, both situations have outraged me really equally.
[01:40:10.811 --> 01:40:19.078]  I'm just shattered to see that this is happening, that we're this close to really all of World War III, and I just really want to remind people that that's what we're looking at here.
[01:40:20.609 --> 01:40:24.638]  Alright, well thank you for joining us and we prayed for you and we're glad you got home safe.
[01:40:24.678 --> 01:40:25.179]  Take care.
[01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:26.481]  You're in Seattle now?
[01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:28.425]  When will you be coming home to Texas?
[01:40:29.429 --> 01:40:37.455]  Well, actually, I'm going to go back down to where I'm living in California now and finish up the book that I've been working on for the next few months.
[01:40:37.795 --> 01:40:38.696]  Alright, take care, Dar.
[01:40:39.096 --> 01:40:39.556]  Thanks a lot.
[01:40:39.676 --> 01:40:40.297]  We appreciate it.
[01:40:40.317 --> 01:40:41.898]  We'll have you on once the new book comes out.
[01:40:41.938 --> 01:40:47.162]  And knowing Dar, he will go to many other war-torn regions and cover it for us.
[01:40:47.202 --> 01:40:48.383]  We appreciate his courage.
[01:40:48.823 --> 01:40:53.567]  That's a lot of courage, folks, to go into southern Lebanon during the bombardments.
[01:40:55.688 --> 01:40:57.129]  Alright, I know we've got a lot of calls.
[01:40:57.209 --> 01:40:58.090]  Tony, Don,
[01:40:59.329 --> 01:41:02.730]  And Ernie and Chris and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:05.191]  I'm going to go to your calls and I'm going to move to them quickly.
[01:41:05.771 --> 01:41:06.871]  And I'm going to move to the next person.
[01:41:06.931 --> 01:41:10.472]  Even if the questions are great or the comments are wonderful, I've got to limit it.
[01:41:10.532 --> 01:41:11.153]  So be ready.
[01:41:11.193 --> 01:41:12.133]  Have your thoughts ready.
[01:41:12.513 --> 01:41:13.773]  Because I want to get a lot of people in.
[01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:18.075]  Well, I've opened phones with the balance of the broadcast the next hour and 17 minutes.
[01:41:19.075 --> 01:41:25.497]  And there's a bunch of other news items I'll be interweaving into the discussions and calls to just briefly recap.
[01:41:26.298 --> 01:41:30.380]  Every major terror attack in modern history has been staged by Western governments.
[01:41:31.081 --> 01:41:33.902]  There have been over 50 fake terror alerts in the U.S.
[01:41:33.942 --> 01:41:37.084]  and England, all admitted later to be fake staged events.
[01:41:37.364 --> 01:41:45.969]  We have huge archives on PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, right now detailing all of that for you.
[01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:49.731]  The Globalists openly have said they want World War III.
[01:41:51.095 --> 01:41:53.437]  We've got a bunch of audio clips of that coming up in the next hour.
[01:41:53.537 --> 01:42:01.523]  They are hyping this thing like never before and all the indicators show that it looks like they're going to stage some massive terror attack here in the U.S.
[01:42:01.984 --> 01:42:07.128]  or in England to be blamed on Syria or Iran to truly kick off World War III.
[01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:15.875]  I want everybody to go to PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com and get the stories that I've written and that Paul Watson's written that we've put out.
[01:42:16.721 --> 01:42:22.422]  Laying out all the evidence, every claim we make is hyperlinked to mainstream news and documents.
[01:42:23.363 --> 01:42:32.525]  And if we expose who stands to gain from terror, who's carried out terror in the past, how they provocateur and set these events up, then we may be able to stop it.
[01:42:33.685 --> 01:42:35.586]  This is on record, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:38.606]  I'll talk more about that in the next hour.
[01:42:39.046 --> 01:42:41.227]  Right now, let's go to Tony in Toronto, Canada.
[01:42:41.527 --> 01:42:42.207]  Tony, welcome.
[01:42:43.127 --> 01:42:45.108]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:50.502]  Yeah, I think it's a real obscenity what's going on over there in Lebanon.
[01:42:50.522 --> 01:42:54.804]  I just wanted to touch on what Darja Ma had talked about with Zionism.
[01:42:54.824 --> 01:42:57.986]  I have a friend who is also a Lebanese Christian.
[01:42:58.026 --> 01:42:59.226]  I've known him since kindergarten.
[01:42:59.266 --> 01:43:02.748]  I have to explain to him that, you know, Christians can be Zionists too.
[01:43:03.548 --> 01:43:14.974]  And further to this concept of a greater Israel, what they really want to do is they want to demolish, they believe they need to demolish the Temple Mount, and they have the plans, they've had them for years, to rebuild Solomon's Temple.
[01:43:15.569 --> 01:43:23.257]  What they need for that, they need some kind of holocaust, like a nuke or a major war, so they can go in and bulldoze this.
[01:43:23.457 --> 01:43:25.480]  And this could be the beginning of it.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:30.725]  I mean, I'm one of those people over the years of Middle East turmoil that hadn't really covered it because I didn't think this was the big one.
[01:43:31.106 --> 01:43:32.147]  This is the big one, folks.
[01:43:32.187 --> 01:43:32.968]  Everything we're seeing.
[01:43:33.248 --> 01:43:34.129]  We're in Iraq.
[01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.890]  We're in Israel.
[01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:41.514]  I mean, imagine Christians saying, we've got to help bring the Antichrist in, we've got to get a temple built so he can come there.
[01:43:41.874 --> 01:43:44.456]  I mean, folks, that's not what Christians are supposed to be doing.
[01:43:44.796 --> 01:43:45.517]  This is sick!
[01:43:46.077 --> 01:43:49.499]  Well, they really play on the ignorance of Westerners about Islam.
[01:43:49.919 --> 01:43:56.404]  I was born Catholic, but I've studied Islam, Judaism, and Christianity for years, and everything they say is a complete lie.
[01:43:56.424 --> 01:44:01.387]  Most people don't know this, but the Catholic Church actually had a papal bull.
[01:44:02.143 --> 01:44:05.786]  Up until recently, condemning the Prophet Muhammad as the Antichrist.
[01:44:05.886 --> 01:44:08.447]  So they're just basically picking the ball up again.
[01:44:33.308 --> 01:44:35.249]  Every time Israel says we'll destroy you or the U.S.
[01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:38.652]  does anything, he says back, we'll destroy you, and it's taken out of context.
[01:44:38.692 --> 01:44:40.693]  And I'm not defending Ahmadinejad.
[01:44:41.013 --> 01:44:41.914]  Governments are evil.
[01:44:43.195 --> 01:44:44.856]  But our government is super evil.
[01:44:45.296 --> 01:44:47.077]  Don in Texas, go ahead.
[01:44:47.097 --> 01:44:49.179]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:51.060]  This is an important time.
[01:44:51.781 --> 01:44:59.686]  I think what's very difficult is to reach the masses of the people, not just your audience that, you know, you preach to the choir, you know,
[01:45:00.307 --> 01:45:01.649]  They know all about it.
[01:45:01.949 --> 01:45:03.270]  Well, we're not really preaching to the choir.
[01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:06.494]  We have tens of thousands of new listeners every day, sir.
[01:45:06.514 --> 01:45:09.137]  Well, what I mean was they agree with you.
[01:45:09.417 --> 01:45:10.839]  Not that you're doing anything bad.
[01:45:10.979 --> 01:45:11.320]  Well, no.
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:14.183]  Don, I'm going to stop you right there because I don't agree with you.
[01:45:14.921 --> 01:45:19.423]  What I'm saying is, we're on AM and FM stations all over this country.
[01:45:19.823 --> 01:45:21.344]  The internet, shortwave, and satellite.
[01:45:21.604 --> 01:45:23.885]  There are new listeners every millisecond, sir.
[01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:25.766]  So everyone listening does not agree with us.
[01:45:25.806 --> 01:45:26.126]  Go ahead.
[01:45:26.367 --> 01:45:28.988]  Well, I just guess I made a false presumption.
[01:45:29.368 --> 01:45:33.770]  Well, I think it's true to say the majority of our listeners agree and are regular listeners.
[01:45:33.810 --> 01:45:38.412]  But a huge, probably 20-30% don't agree or are open-minded.
[01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:38.773]  Go ahead.
[01:45:38.873 --> 01:45:39.653]  You have a huge audience.
[01:45:40.313 --> 01:46:06.633]  And like on Coast to Coast, you know, I've noticed lately they've changed their tone, they're starting to go along with these, you know, some of the people I don't agree with, you don't, to give them the idea, there's kind of a fable or a formula thought that all the Muslims have been, all the terrorists have been Muslims, which I don't believe that, and that therefore, the equation says, they're our enemy, they want to kill us, we need to nuke them off.
[01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:08.535]  And you're hearing that very prolifically now,
[01:46:08.988 --> 01:46:15.233]  On the news, Neil Bark and Limbaugh and even a lot of the local people, and it seems so childish and stupid.
[01:46:15.703 --> 01:46:18.905]  You get to wonder if maybe the chemtrails had some suggestibility.
[01:46:19.085 --> 01:46:27.031]  Well, the President has openly announced, it has been in official newspapers, that they have a plan to use mini-nukes on 214 sites.
[01:46:27.091 --> 01:46:32.574]  Well, a mini-nuke is just as painful as a Maggie nuke.
[01:46:32.614 --> 01:46:34.316]  Well, it's an oxymoron.
[01:46:34.536 --> 01:46:34.896]  That is.
[01:46:35.196 --> 01:46:37.398]  And they're going to use the Neron.
[01:46:37.418 --> 01:46:40.239]  The point is, sir, is that it isn't craziness.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.001]  As much as it is... Don?
[01:46:42.021 --> 01:46:42.781]  John Hagee.
[01:46:45.874 --> 01:46:46.434]  I agree, Don.
[01:46:46.514 --> 01:46:48.636]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:48.676 --> 01:46:51.858]  Let me try to go back and respond to the point you were just making.
[01:47:14.731 --> 01:47:17.352]  Notice that the White House says we may nuke Iran.
[01:47:17.412 --> 01:47:19.313]  I mean, that has been officially put out.
[01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:20.533]  Okay?
[01:47:21.434 --> 01:47:22.414]  What, about three months ago.
[01:47:23.894 --> 01:47:27.176]  And they've put in magazines and newspapers pictures of the nukes.
[01:47:27.256 --> 01:47:27.956]  I mean, they've made them.
[01:47:27.996 --> 01:47:29.216]  They made them four years ago.
[01:47:30.937 --> 01:47:32.437]  And imagine, you're Iran and the U.S.
[01:47:32.457 --> 01:47:33.278]  saying, we're going to nuke you.
[01:47:33.438 --> 01:47:34.978]  And Iran goes, boy, we're going to fight back.
[01:47:35.339 --> 01:47:36.779]  Oh my gosh, they said they'll attack us!
[01:47:36.819 --> 01:47:37.199]  Look, look!
[01:47:37.539 --> 01:47:39.240]  And the actual quote is, we're going to attack you back.
[01:47:40.399 --> 01:47:45.402]  And, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't call these, quote, Christian Zionists, uh, even Christians.
[01:47:46.863 --> 01:47:49.405]  I mean, I mean, Hagee, you can watch Hagee.
[01:47:49.425 --> 01:47:50.186]  He's in San Antonio.
[01:47:50.246 --> 01:47:51.186]  I've watched him.
[01:47:51.206 --> 01:47:53.548]  I agree with most of the stuff he says until he gets to this Israel thing.
[01:47:53.848 --> 01:47:55.910]  And I have heard him say it's the dual covenant.
[01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:59.912]  And that Jews are better than the rest of Christians.
[01:48:00.733 --> 01:48:02.274]  And that there are big brothers.
[01:48:02.294 --> 01:48:03.795]  I've actually seen him say this.
[01:48:04.375 --> 01:48:04.956]  And you know what?
[01:48:05.056 --> 01:48:06.877]  Jews are just as good as everybody else.
[01:48:08.078 --> 01:48:08.358]  Okay?
[01:48:09.230 --> 01:48:15.615]  And everybody is, you know, an American Indian is as good as a Jew, a German is as good as somebody who's Chinese.
[01:48:15.835 --> 01:48:17.157]  I am sick of this!
[01:48:17.837 --> 01:48:21.240]  I'm tired of hearing... And most Jews don't like this either.
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:22.501]  I mean, this is craziness!
[01:48:23.582 --> 01:48:29.827]  And Hagee flies to Israel, he's got this American pack to support it, and this is craziness!
[01:48:31.388 --> 01:48:34.791]  This is absolute craziness, and they do imply that
[01:48:35.794 --> 01:48:38.015]  Well, they state to be a Christian.
[01:48:38.055 --> 01:48:44.319]  Well, I mean, Pat Robertson, every time a Jewish leader gets killed, he gets in and says, well, that's because they didn't support expanding Israel.
[01:48:44.839 --> 01:48:49.902]  Or, oh, Ariel Sharon had a stroke because he took people out of this area of Israel.
[01:48:50.982 --> 01:48:53.064]  I mean, that is not Christianity.
[01:48:54.104 --> 01:49:01.628]  Pat Robertson, with all his racehorses and all the TV networks he owns and everything he does, it's a joke, okay?
[01:49:02.249 --> 01:49:04.530]  How do you think the devil is going to take over America?
[01:49:05.470 --> 01:49:06.891]  He takes control of the churches.
[01:49:08.071 --> 01:49:11.652]  It is now a sacrament.
[01:49:11.712 --> 01:49:15.754]  It is now part of the religion of most people who call themselves Christians.
[01:49:16.274 --> 01:49:16.874]  It's a cult!
[01:49:17.955 --> 01:49:20.456]  And it is wild.
[01:49:20.656 --> 01:49:22.136]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:49:22.797 --> 01:49:24.137]  You actually look at the prophets.
[01:49:24.197 --> 01:49:31.840]  They came and would rebuke Israel and tell Israel they'd been bad and tell their leaders they were going to be judged and would speak out against the corrupt government.
[01:49:32.758 --> 01:49:35.100]  No, you, it is now, they say, a tenant.
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:38.683]  You will go to hell if you criticize Israel in any way.
[01:49:39.143 --> 01:49:43.566]  I mean, I've had the calls here on air before going, Alex, I used to listen to you, but you're going to hell now.
[01:49:43.606 --> 01:49:44.567]  You criticize Israel.
[01:49:45.467 --> 01:49:46.888]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[01:49:47.429 --> 01:49:48.810]  I criticize all these governments.
[01:49:55.479 --> 01:49:55.940]  It's here!
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:00.944]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.304 --> 01:50:08.990]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.650 --> 01:50:16.716]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.096 --> 01:50:23.962]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:24.474 --> 01:50:28.516]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.816 --> 01:50:32.338]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.798 --> 01:50:34.699]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.059 --> 01:50:38.961]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.913 --> 01:50:56.433]  Captain, we got trouble.
[01:50:56.653 --> 01:50:56.994]  What?
[01:50:57.174 --> 01:50:58.815]  The cattle haven't had water for two days.
[01:50:58.995 --> 01:51:01.156]  We found a pond, but the cattle won't drink from it.
[01:51:01.216 --> 01:51:01.896]  Well, why not?
[01:51:02.036 --> 01:51:05.538]  Well, Captain, it's loaded with pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites.
[01:51:05.638 --> 01:51:09.800]  It's also contaminated with chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, and MTBE.
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:12.642]  And there's even heavy metals like lead and mercury in the water.
[01:51:12.842 --> 01:51:14.365]  Break out the Crown Berkey.
[01:51:14.505 --> 01:51:16.728]  But Captain, we've got 200 head of cattle.
[01:51:16.828 --> 01:51:20.574]  That Crown Berkey will purify 27 gallons of water per hour with 8 elements.
[01:51:20.674 --> 01:51:21.716]  You just keep it full.
[01:51:21.916 --> 01:51:22.958]  Captain, it's working.
[01:51:23.038 --> 01:51:25.582]  The cattle are drinking, and look, they're even smiling.
[01:51:29.053 --> 01:51:31.975]  Berkey, the filter that won the West.
[01:51:32.295 --> 01:51:37.357]  Get your Crown Berkey Purifier with two black Berkey purification elements for only $299 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:37.377 --> 01:51:37.638]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:37.698 --> 01:51:39.178]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:39.339 --> 01:51:40.739]  Not yet available in California or Iowa.
[01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.349]  I think so.
[01:52:08.411 --> 01:52:09.052]  We're good to go!
[01:52:37.933 --> 01:52:41.034]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:41.174 --> 01:52:47.155]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.116 --> 01:53:03.678]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:04.999 --> 01:53:06.139]  Glad that you were able to
[01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:08.231]  Join us today.
[01:53:10.012 --> 01:53:21.920]  Briefly, before I go back to your phone calls and then get into... I'm going to recap and bring in some of the other elements I haven't gotten into yet of why I believe the government is going to stage a terror attack by late October.
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:26.484]  It could be any time now until October to really kick off World War III.
[01:53:26.584 --> 01:53:31.987]  This is my second alert in my 12 years of telecasting and broadcasting.
[01:53:32.568 --> 01:53:34.129]  I think you really should take it seriously.
[01:53:35.023 --> 01:53:36.204]  It's not a gut feeling.
[01:53:36.244 --> 01:53:39.307]  It's like I look at all the evidence and I see the pattern and I go, that's it!
[01:53:39.967 --> 01:53:41.649]  That's, you know, I see it again.
[01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:43.390]  The second time I've seen this.
[01:53:44.211 --> 01:53:47.394]  And just look at all the rest of the wild things that are happening right now.
[01:53:48.695 --> 01:53:52.358]  I hope you'll join us in Dallas on the 26th of August.
[01:53:53.099 --> 01:53:57.803]  Jim Mars, professor, author, lecturer, will give a speech for an hour titled,
[01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:59.510]  It's going to be excellent.
[01:53:59.550 --> 01:54:01.693]  JFK at 9-11 and take your questions.
[01:54:02.314 --> 01:54:03.836]  His new book will be launched there.
[01:54:03.956 --> 01:54:08.282]  We're going to be selling his new book that I just got in that won't even be available until September 11th.
[01:54:08.343 --> 01:54:09.384]  We're going to have it there on the 26th.
[01:54:11.196 --> 01:54:12.057]  Up in Dallas.
[01:54:12.077 --> 01:54:15.618]  And we're going to show my new film, Terror Storm, the final complete version.
[01:54:15.678 --> 01:54:16.258]  It's amazing.
[01:54:16.678 --> 01:54:20.820]  Then I'll show about 35 minutes of Bilderberg footage we got up in Ottawa in June.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.921]  And then, you know, that's from 7 to about 11.30.
[01:54:24.602 --> 01:54:28.543]  And then if you want to stay, there's going to be great music by Shanghai Five and others.
[01:54:28.683 --> 01:54:29.484]  Great lounge music.
[01:54:29.824 --> 01:54:32.545]  It's a nice theater with snacks and drinks and all that stuff.
[01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:35.731]  for you there, and there's restaurants in the area.
[01:54:36.212 --> 01:54:39.113]  So it's going to be a great event coming up this August 26th.
[01:54:39.673 --> 01:54:47.638]  Get your tickets at InfoWars.com or call toll free to get tickets 1-888-253-3139 888-253-3139 Now, you can also get a copy of my new film Terror Storm by going to InfoWars.com
[01:55:00.787 --> 01:55:07.710]  By next Monday, we will probably stop selling the emergency release edition that doesn't have the extras on it.
[01:55:08.150 --> 01:55:19.055]  It is the raw, about four minutes longer than the official film, American Scholars Symposium version of Terror Storm.
[01:55:19.475 --> 01:55:27.098]  It has the menu that says American Scholars Symposium version, and it's a little bit longer film, and each copy is signed.
[01:55:28.104 --> 01:55:31.929]  If you mail us a check, it's posted by Monday.
[01:55:32.770 --> 01:55:44.344]  We'll keep a few over for mail orders that come in, but by Monday we're going to take it down off the site because by end of week next week we're going to be getting the official DVDs in.
[01:55:46.816 --> 01:55:51.860]  I am encouraging everybody to go to InfoWars.com and get this collector's edition.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:52.821]  It's an excellent film.
[01:55:53.141 --> 01:55:54.963]  It also makes this broadcast possible.
[01:55:55.343 --> 01:56:02.589]  Again, that's InfoWars.com to get your American Scholars Symposium version of the film.
[01:56:02.649 --> 01:56:04.671]  It's the version of the film we screened in
[01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:10.250]  We're good to go.
[01:56:25.923 --> 01:56:27.084]  We're good to go.
[01:56:48.724 --> 01:57:07.206]  is now up on PrisonPlanet.TV for members with four camera shoots, my weekly TV reports, in-studio video reports, my book, Paul Watson's book, all my best audio interviews, PrisonPlanet.TV, 15 cents a day, get a monthly membership for $5.95, get a yearly membership and get three months free!

[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:12.261]  I've done some accounting.
[01:57:12.741 --> 01:57:16.785]  If it wasn't for you supporting us, we really wouldn't even be in operation right now.
[01:57:16.825 --> 01:57:18.066]  I'm spending so much money.
[01:57:18.526 --> 01:57:20.588]  I'm spending... I'm actually losing money right now.
[01:57:20.908 --> 01:57:24.452]  We're spending so much to fight the New World Order, but that's okay.
[01:57:24.812 --> 01:57:27.654]  That's what money's meant to be spent on, is to fight these creatures.
[01:57:28.155 --> 01:57:29.876]  Alright, so get a membership.
[01:57:29.896 --> 01:57:31.298]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:32.037 --> 01:57:39.159]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:48.641 --> 01:57:49.301]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.941 --> 01:57:51.042]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.702 --> 01:57:52.822]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.482 --> 01:57:54.283]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.043 --> 01:57:55.823]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.585 --> 01:58:00.529]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.789 --> 01:58:04.852]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.305 --> 01:58:21.471]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number three, coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:58:21.531 --> 01:58:41.228]  I'll try to do a calm, concise, five-minute recap and add some data points I haven't discussed on air of why I believe, why I predict, that barring a massive mobilization and the people getting the word out, we are going to have a huge government false flag, self-inflicted wound, inside job, terror attack,
[01:58:42.353 --> 01:58:42.953]  In the U.S.
[01:58:43.013 --> 01:58:46.454]  or England by late October and probably earlier.
[01:58:47.854 --> 01:58:49.635]  Early October is the main zone.
[01:58:51.335 --> 01:58:52.675]  It could even be in September.
[01:58:54.416 --> 01:58:58.077]  Very, in fact, I would say mid-September to early October is the key zone.
[01:58:58.297 --> 01:58:59.297]  But it could happen tomorrow.
[01:58:59.917 --> 01:59:00.837]  It could happen next week.
[01:59:02.098 --> 01:59:11.760]  Or they could have a bunch of fake terror alerts and kind of just move it into the election, hope that works, and then definitely something huge before the next presidential election.
[01:59:12.981 --> 01:59:16.423]  But I'm predicting right now, in the next two months, we're going to see something big.
[01:59:18.143 --> 01:59:19.944]  Unless we really get the word out.
[01:59:21.765 --> 01:59:24.566]  In fact, a victory would just be the government staging something small.
[01:59:25.647 --> 01:59:28.688]  I've only made one other prediction like this, and unfortunately it came true.
[01:59:29.108 --> 01:59:31.869]  So I'm telling you, that's how many indicators I've got on this.
[01:59:31.969 --> 01:59:32.549]  It's serious.
[01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:33.370]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:38.252]  Let's talk to Ernie in New Jersey.
[01:59:38.272 --> 01:59:39.232]  You're on the air, Ernie.
[01:59:39.252 --> 01:59:40.073]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:41.857 --> 01:59:42.177]  Bless you.
[01:59:42.197 --> 01:59:42.898]  How are you doing?
[01:59:43.078 --> 01:59:43.378]  Thank you.
[01:59:43.398 --> 01:59:44.018]  What's on your mind?
[01:59:44.038 --> 01:59:44.939]  A couple things.
[01:59:45.059 --> 01:59:46.060]  Always lead the people.
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:49.002]  Many hands make the job a lot easier.
[01:59:49.142 --> 01:59:56.886]  My thought was, listening to you, was that, uh, briefly, Fraunhofer stood up to Hitler right during the, uh, midst of when Hitler was taken over.
[01:59:56.906 --> 02:00:01.029]  I think there's a lot, a lot of people like him around right now, so we're going to have to wait until the very end.
[02:00:01.689 --> 02:00:03.130]  My thoughts are on Lou Dobbs, quickly.
[02:00:03.411 --> 02:00:10.275]  Uh, he's done excellent, excellent pieces on illegal, uh, immigration, especially now with the drug smuggler getting, uh,
[02:00:11.218 --> 02:00:17.799]  You need to go after the Border Patrol agents for breaking some type of administration procedure.
[02:00:18.599 --> 02:00:20.700]  I called Johnny Sutton.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.940]  He's the District Attorney.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:29.542]  I said I believe him and his assistant actually belong in jail for aiding and abetting a drug dealer and he's illegal.
[02:00:31.202 --> 02:00:37.163]  So my quick follow-up comment would be start getting in on Lou Dawes when he says something like this.
[02:00:37.978 --> 02:00:39.999]  Should be from $15,000 to $20,000 to $40,000 to $50,000.
[02:00:40.299 --> 02:00:42.921]  You should have it's own estimate.
[02:00:42.961 --> 02:00:44.462]  Also, you should do something like this.
[02:00:44.562 --> 02:00:45.483]  I missed that last part.
[02:00:45.503 --> 02:00:46.123]  What are you saying?
[02:00:46.403 --> 02:00:47.064]  Oh, Lou Dobbs.
[02:00:47.324 --> 02:00:56.889]  He has a quick vote on the Justice Department that gave him immunity to an illegal immigrant who was a drug smuggler.
[02:00:57.590 --> 02:00:59.291]  He was shot apparently by Border Patrol.
[02:01:00.583 --> 02:01:03.644]  Trying to apprehend... Oh, yeah, to then prosecute the Border Patrol.
[02:01:03.704 --> 02:01:07.525]  Yeah, to prosecute it and let the... This is a pattern they do.
[02:01:07.845 --> 02:01:08.165]  Oh, I know.
[02:01:08.205 --> 02:01:10.106]  Illegal aliens have more rights than citizens.
[02:01:10.146 --> 02:01:10.966]  Thank you for the call.
[02:01:11.426 --> 02:01:12.506]  Good to hear from you, Ernie.
[02:01:12.987 --> 02:01:13.767]  Chris in Florida.
[02:01:13.787 --> 02:01:14.447]  You're on the air.
[02:01:15.847 --> 02:01:16.048]  Alex?
[02:01:16.708 --> 02:01:16.988]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:17.008 --> 02:01:17.408]  Go ahead.
[02:01:18.048 --> 02:01:20.609]  Yes, I called up... I spoke with Bill O'Reilly today.
[02:01:20.969 --> 02:01:21.489]  Oh, really?
[02:01:21.829 --> 02:01:22.049]  Yeah.
[02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.269]  Yeah.
[02:01:22.309 --> 02:01:23.810]  Well, not... I called the show, actually.
[02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.790]  No, no.
[02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:25.530]  Good job.
[02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.910]  Go ahead.
[02:01:26.411 --> 02:01:27.851]  And spoke with Michael Sparkonish.
[02:01:28.636 --> 02:01:52.442]  I said that in this past Summer of Fear, of course that's a term Jack Blood terms, and I asked him, in the last six months, have you been able to find one terrorist attack that has not been by entrapment, done by patsies, or informants who entrapped and formed a group that never existed in the first place, and brought up the Miami deal?
[02:01:53.062 --> 02:01:57.363]  And I'm sorry, I'm getting a bad echo, it's just hard to hear what I'm saying.
[02:01:58.341 --> 02:02:02.945]  So I said, I would encourage your listeners to double-check your response.
[02:02:03.565 --> 02:02:10.991]  Well, his answer was that he'd like to turn the tables on me and ask me of one case where it was as I described.
[02:02:11.772 --> 02:02:15.915]  And I said, I kept on repeating, I just did, I just did, but he had already cut me off.
[02:02:16.675 --> 02:02:17.876]  That's what they do.
[02:02:17.916 --> 02:02:19.778]  They know the public is stupid.
[02:02:20.538 --> 02:02:27.744]  And so they know if they just make false claims and say you're a liar, that somehow that makes you a liar.
[02:02:28.402 --> 02:02:30.564]  Good job, but anything else you'd like to add, Chris?
[02:02:31.145 --> 02:02:32.906]  Uh, yeah, if anybody, uh... Well, stay there.
[02:02:32.986 --> 02:02:33.567]  Stay there, Chris.
[02:02:33.627 --> 02:02:35.909]  I want to hear more about this Bill O'Reilly call.
[02:02:36.450 --> 02:02:39.312]  Yeah, I mean, you'll announce things that are totally true on these talk shows.
[02:02:39.653 --> 02:02:40.713]  We'll just say you're a liar.
[02:02:40.734 --> 02:02:44.357]  Because they know we have a public that literally doesn't know anything.
[02:02:47.410 --> 02:02:50.571]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:50.911 --> 02:02:52.852]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:53.232 --> 02:03:00.874]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.575 --> 02:03:08.597]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.017 --> 02:03:15.859]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:16.383 --> 02:03:20.425]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.746 --> 02:03:24.228]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.708 --> 02:03:26.629]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.969 --> 02:03:30.872]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:46.804 --> 02:03:48.344]  Captain, we got trouble.
[02:03:48.564 --> 02:03:48.905]  What?
[02:03:49.065 --> 02:03:50.726]  The cattle haven't had water for two days.
[02:03:50.886 --> 02:03:53.047]  We found a pond, but the cattle won't drink from it.
[02:03:53.127 --> 02:03:53.787]  Well, why not?
[02:03:53.927 --> 02:03:57.449]  Well, Captain, it's loaded with pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites.
[02:03:57.529 --> 02:04:01.391]  It's also contaminated with chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, and MTBE.
[02:04:01.731 --> 02:04:04.553]  And there's even heavy metals like lead and mercury in the water.
[02:04:04.733 --> 02:04:06.255]  Break out the Crown Berkey.
[02:04:06.415 --> 02:04:08.618]  But Captain, we've got 200 head of cattle.
[02:04:08.718 --> 02:04:12.482]  That Crown Berkey will purify 27 gallons of water per hour with 8 elements.
[02:04:12.583 --> 02:04:13.624]  You just keep it full.
[02:04:13.824 --> 02:04:14.865]  Captain, it's working.
[02:04:14.945 --> 02:04:17.489]  The cattle are drinking, and look, they're even smiling.
[02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:23.871]  Berkey, the filter that won the West.
[02:04:24.191 --> 02:04:29.274]  Get your Crown Berkey Purifier with two black Berkey purification elements for only $299 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:29.294 --> 02:04:29.594]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:29.614 --> 02:04:31.075]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:31.095 --> 02:04:32.675]  Not yet available in California or Iowa.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:50.368]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[02:04:50.628 --> 02:04:56.195]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[02:04:56.515 --> 02:04:57.857]  Currently for sale by owner,
[02:04:58.237 --> 02:05:03.060]  The Ultimate Secure Home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of Southwest Colorado.
[02:05:03.281 --> 02:05:10.125]  This patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[02:05:10.345 --> 02:05:19.332]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[02:05:19.872 --> 02:05:20.192]  That's it!
[02:05:44.587 --> 02:05:50.211]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.336 --> 02:06:03.739]  The British government was caught making up stories about a plot to kill everybody in London with Ryerson.
[02:06:05.396 --> 02:06:08.718]  They have been caught over and over again staging fake terror alerts.
[02:06:09.298 --> 02:06:13.620]  Ari Fleischer, the White House Press Secretary, admitted they were releasing them for political reasons.
[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.320]  Republican memos have come out.
[02:06:15.921 --> 02:06:17.261]  We know they're doing this.
[02:06:17.601 --> 02:06:25.085]  We know that they go and have FBI agents or informants literally, from whole cloth, go create Klan groups to carry out terror.
[02:06:25.505 --> 02:06:26.845]  Go create militia groups.
[02:06:27.145 --> 02:06:28.766]  Go create Muslim groups.
[02:06:29.306 --> 02:06:31.167]  Over and over, it's the same memo!
[02:06:31.207 --> 02:06:32.908]  These groups don't really exist!
[02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:35.948]  Here in the Western world.
[02:06:36.970 --> 02:06:41.275]  And believe me, you can go find mental patients, you can go find extremists, you can go find weirdos.
[02:06:41.635 --> 02:06:45.620]  You start throwing a bunch of money around, you can get people to at least talk about doing it.
[02:06:47.101 --> 02:06:50.926]  And Chris in Florida said he called into O'Reilly's show today
[02:06:51.915 --> 02:07:09.138]  and brought all this up and then and said show me one instance O'Reilly where it hasn't been a set up provocateur entrapment and O'Reilly said you show me one instance and then hung up on him you see and so the average dumbbell listening to that goes oh see there isn't one instance O'Reilly sure told him
[02:07:10.228 --> 02:07:12.690]  This is a public that doesn't know how many continents there are.
[02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:15.893]  This is a public that doesn't know their state capitals on average.
[02:07:16.253 --> 02:07:18.795]  Most high school seniors cannot tell you who the vice president is.
[02:07:19.376 --> 02:07:20.036]  80 plus percent.
[02:07:20.877 --> 02:07:24.140]  Most Americans believe that there is no free speech in America.
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:26.882]  30 percent don't know what year 9-11 happened.
[02:07:27.462 --> 02:07:35.349]  I mean, they just literally, but they know all about the sitcoms, all about baseball and football, all about beauty products, all about things that don't matter.
[02:07:37.190 --> 02:07:39.072]  It's not just that, it's not even that we're stupid.
[02:07:40.463 --> 02:07:44.046]  It's that we're just mesmerized by things that don't matter.
[02:07:44.506 --> 02:07:45.988]  And so we're being taken advantage of!
[02:07:46.708 --> 02:07:53.013]  And you've got these scammers on radio and TV that can only get away with this because the people are so uninformed.
[02:07:53.433 --> 02:07:57.957]  Going back to Chris, and then we'll go to Zach and so many others that are holding.
[02:07:57.977 --> 02:08:00.138]  Uh, Chris, Chris dropped by.
[02:08:00.158 --> 02:08:01.399]  I told him twice to hold on.
[02:08:01.419 --> 02:08:03.140]  Then I came back and said we were going to him.
[02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:03.801]  Did he just drop?
[02:08:06.363 --> 02:08:06.783]  Oh, I wish.
[02:08:07.083 --> 02:08:07.504]  Oh, okay.
[02:08:07.624 --> 02:08:07.664]  Oh.
[02:08:08.777 --> 02:08:09.858]  Makes a lot of sense now, doesn't it?
[02:08:10.818 --> 02:08:12.379]  Let's go ahead and go to Zach in New York.
[02:08:12.459 --> 02:08:13.140]  Zach, go ahead.
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:19.043]  Hi, I'm engaged in a rather tragic intellectual battle on a highly conservative web forum.
[02:08:19.263 --> 02:08:24.126]  The kind of place where, you know, they talk about the need for all the Muslims to die, and what else?
[02:08:24.266 --> 02:08:26.348]  You know, they fawn over Ann Coulter and Adam Zabel.
[02:08:26.908 --> 02:08:31.311]  And I don't really have enough time or internet access to fully engage in the debate.
[02:08:31.711 --> 02:08:33.572]  And I was wondering if I could give a plug for the website.
[02:08:33.592 --> 02:08:34.733]  I'm in no way involved with it.
[02:08:34.813 --> 02:08:35.733]  It's at the public forums.
[02:08:37.757 --> 02:08:50.390]  Also, I was wondering if you had any more information about the enormous series of bombings in Bangladesh that I remember you speaking about like a year ago or so, the simultaneous bombings in 300 different places, and I never heard anything about that again.
[02:08:50.850 --> 02:08:53.473]  Well, I mean, let's go back first to some neocon blog.
[02:08:53.793 --> 02:08:55.695]  I would imagine this is a predominantly
[02:08:57.085 --> 02:08:58.887]  Communist brainwash zombie site.
[02:08:58.927 --> 02:09:02.109]  By that, according to their own political paradigm, it's false.
[02:09:02.129 --> 02:09:05.312]  If they really looked at themselves, they're communist.
[02:09:06.133 --> 02:09:08.495]  In their real actions and support, not in their rhetoric.
[02:09:08.795 --> 02:09:15.621]  But the new brainwash commie is so commie, they don't even know it.
[02:09:15.821 --> 02:09:24.308]  I would guess this is an ultra-liberal website calling itself conservative, probably run by some minion.
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:28.981]  Well, they're rather fair about letting, you know, if you want to... Okay, well, that's good.
[02:09:29.221 --> 02:09:36.824]  But, I mean, my point is, Christ said, don't throw your pearls before swine, let the dead bury the dead, dust the dust off your feet.
[02:09:37.544 --> 02:09:40.566]  I mean, I personally, you can plug any website you want, brother.
[02:09:41.006 --> 02:09:46.648]  It's just that, why go argue with a bunch of people that don't want to be convinced and can care less?
[02:09:46.688 --> 02:09:49.009]  I mean, why not go on to people that care and want to hear?
[02:09:49.249 --> 02:09:52.890]  Look, I mean, I argue with these zombies all the time.
[02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:54.731]  They don't believe Bush is anti-gun.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.025]  They don't believe he wants open borders.
[02:09:57.125 --> 02:09:58.952]  They don't know he signed an American Union.
[02:09:59.273 --> 02:10:00.798]  They don't know he signed onto U.N.
[02:10:00.838 --> 02:10:01.159]  treaties.
[02:10:02.046 --> 02:10:02.626]  They don't know.
[02:10:02.946 --> 02:10:05.207]  He spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[02:10:05.527 --> 02:10:08.688]  They'll admit they're stealing money out of the treasury and say that's good.
[02:10:09.148 --> 02:10:12.608]  I mean, these people are sick, but sure, go ahead, plug it.
[02:10:13.028 --> 02:10:14.789]  It's cronwatch.com.
[02:10:14.969 --> 02:10:18.210]  C-H-R-O-N-W-A-T-C-H dot com.
[02:10:19.590 --> 02:10:23.451]  And you want us all to go in there and basically take, overwhelm them.
[02:10:23.751 --> 02:10:26.492]  What particular forum area is it?
[02:10:26.632 --> 02:10:27.552]  Topics of the day.
[02:10:27.652 --> 02:10:28.232]  You know, there's
[02:10:29.182 --> 02:10:31.224]  That's basically the one with the most traffic.
[02:10:31.384 --> 02:10:33.145]  There's like 20,000 posts on there, so far.
[02:10:33.485 --> 02:10:38.509]  Well, I mean, I think, you know, instead you should not even engage them, but carpet bomb them with info.
[02:10:38.929 --> 02:10:42.192]  I would just go post a bunch of links to TerrorStorm.
[02:10:42.432 --> 02:10:44.053]  Oh, you're a nutjob, just so you know.
[02:10:44.433 --> 02:10:45.134]  Oh, of course I am.
[02:10:45.514 --> 02:10:46.115]  Of course I am.
[02:10:46.815 --> 02:10:48.497]  Of course, I mean, you know, I read official U.S.
[02:10:48.517 --> 02:10:58.284]  government documents that say they want to carry out terror attacks, and I read official CIA after-action reports on CIA.gov where they admit they carry them out, and I'm upset about it, so I'm nuts, yeah.
[02:10:59.691 --> 02:11:07.055]  But if you really want to freak them out, go in there and go, well, here's Bob Barr saying Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton.
[02:11:07.375 --> 02:11:08.435]  And then put a link up there.
[02:11:08.775 --> 02:11:11.397]  And explain to them that they're not the conservatives.
[02:11:11.417 --> 02:11:12.097]  They're scum.
[02:11:12.617 --> 02:11:13.598]  I appreciate your call.
[02:11:14.478 --> 02:11:16.699]  Let's go ahead and who's up next here?
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:18.960]  Chad in Iowa.
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:19.600]  You're on the air.
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:20.041]  Go ahead.
[02:11:20.061 --> 02:11:21.221]  Hi.
[02:11:22.001 --> 02:11:25.203]  I just called to say I'm not so sure
[02:11:25.805 --> 02:11:37.873]  The temple that the Antichrist is supposed to come to is a physical thing, because he said he would come and set down in the temple, and Christ said, know ye not that the temple is in your heart.
[02:11:38.033 --> 02:11:41.976]  That's all I had to say, but you're doing an awesome, awesome job on talking to people every day.
[02:11:42.036 --> 02:11:42.696]  Thank you very much.
[02:11:42.716 --> 02:11:42.997]  Goodbye.
[02:11:43.337 --> 02:11:44.338]  I appreciate your call.
[02:11:44.438 --> 02:11:52.223]  Christ is saying because the temple is going to be destroyed, and not a stone left unturned, that now the temple is going to be in your heart.
[02:11:52.887 --> 02:12:06.832]  But that doesn't mean that a false third temple will not be built, and that there will be, you know, the beast will be there, and he'll have this likeness that speaks, there'll be this big hologram, pretty high tech, it's like a science fiction book if it's all in there.
[02:12:09.514 --> 02:12:11.514]  So, you know, that's what's happening.
[02:12:13.255 --> 02:12:19.697]  I mean, again, even if you don't believe in God, which I do, the people that are running Christianity in the U.S.
[02:12:19.718 --> 02:12:19.918]  today
[02:12:21.707 --> 02:12:23.728]  Openly won Armageddon, and I've talked to them.
[02:12:23.768 --> 02:12:24.588]  I've gone, it's horrible.
[02:12:24.628 --> 02:12:25.828]  They want to put chips in people.
[02:12:26.128 --> 02:12:28.169]  Praise the Lord, the end's here.
[02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:30.089]  I love it!
[02:12:30.490 --> 02:12:33.430]  And I go, but, but, we've got to warn people.
[02:12:33.891 --> 02:12:36.391]  No, no, we're going to be gone soon, Alex.
[02:12:36.771 --> 02:12:37.452]  You'll be with us.
[02:12:37.492 --> 02:12:38.952]  I go, but we've, okay, even if that's true,
[02:12:39.648 --> 02:12:41.748]  We've got to warn all these people this is happening.
[02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:44.709]  But if it's meant for them to take it, they will.
[02:12:44.749 --> 02:12:45.909]  They're going to hell!
[02:12:46.289 --> 02:12:47.870]  And I'll say, no, no, no, listen.
[02:12:47.890 --> 02:12:48.930]  We've got a job to warn people.
[02:12:48.970 --> 02:12:49.790]  This is bad stuff.
[02:12:49.810 --> 02:12:51.250]  This is a control grid.
[02:12:52.631 --> 02:12:54.011]  Your churches are paid off.
[02:12:54.031 --> 02:12:55.931]  They can't talk about politics now.
[02:12:56.992 --> 02:12:57.592]  Well, that's it.
[02:12:57.812 --> 02:13:00.372]  Just don't worry about it, Alex.
[02:13:02.333 --> 02:13:03.813]  And you're just like, oh my gosh.
[02:13:07.054 --> 02:13:08.715]  I don't even know what to say anymore about it.
[02:13:09.155 --> 02:13:12.236]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Montana!
[02:13:12.916 --> 02:13:13.576]  Welcome, Mike!
[02:13:14.277 --> 02:13:16.337]  Hello from Big Sky Country!
[02:13:16.497 --> 02:13:17.138]  Alex, how are ya?
[02:13:17.518 --> 02:13:17.758]  Good.
[02:13:17.838 --> 02:13:18.518]  Roll your mic.
[02:13:19.158 --> 02:13:21.179]  Hey, I'm 34 years old.
[02:13:21.419 --> 02:13:23.420]  I feel a kindled spirit with ya.
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:26.061]  I run a library up here with your videos.
[02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:31.803]  And people can come in and check them out and view them and bring them back.
[02:13:31.883 --> 02:13:34.124]  And people who've got different ones can bring them in and view them out.
[02:13:34.144 --> 02:13:35.144]  So I'm doing my fight.
[02:13:35.615 --> 02:13:36.915]  Good job, alright!
[02:13:37.516 --> 02:13:44.298]  Now, this is what I want to bring up, as I know that history repeats itself, that's not some propaganda, that's true.
[02:13:44.778 --> 02:13:49.560]  As I looked at the timeline of how Hitler took over and how he spent a lot of time creating
[02:13:50.325 --> 02:13:52.145]  Uh, terrorism to take over the state.
[02:13:52.445 --> 02:14:04.128]  There was a point in time where he started annexing different places, and that's, uh, like... He grabbed Danzig, he grabbed, uh, different, uh, little, little sub-districts that had been taken originally, which sounded good to the Germans.
[02:14:04.168 --> 02:14:10.229]  Then he, then he grabbed Austria, then he grabbed, uh, Czechoslovakia, and then when he rolled into Poland, World War II started.
[02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:16.510]  Right, then, then he went to Middle East, and he went for Samoa, and then he brought his forces back in defeat,
[02:14:16.937 --> 02:14:21.440]  And then he went to the Eastern Front, and we know that the Eastern Front is where they would approach you.
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:23.461]  Oh, you don't agree with Hitler's program?
[02:14:23.501 --> 02:14:24.322]  Well, join the Army.
[02:14:24.382 --> 02:14:25.522]  To the Eastern Front you go.
[02:14:25.902 --> 02:14:35.008]  So I think what the New World is trying to do is give us a World War III so that all us good Americans that would carry on the fight here would be drafted and pushed over into some Eastern Front.
[02:14:35.408 --> 02:14:36.230]  Oh, no, that's it!
[02:14:36.250 --> 02:14:46.824]  No, no, they've got the draft boards re-lined up, they've set them back up, they've gotten the funding, the Army posted a year ago, they're getting ready for the draft, they've introduced the legislation, and you call in to Bill O'Reilly, he'll say it doesn't exist!
[02:14:47.545 --> 02:14:47.826]  Again!
[02:14:48.917 --> 02:14:50.758]  Again, they're all liars.
[02:14:50.798 --> 02:14:54.119]  They'll tell you it's the law, you've got to take vaccinations, and your kids do.
[02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:54.920]  Not true.
[02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:59.442]  Then they'll tell you there's no such thing as a draft being set back up, you see.
[02:15:00.762 --> 02:15:02.823]  And see, that's what comes after the next big attack, folks.
[02:15:02.903 --> 02:15:09.266]  World War III, the draft, domestic police state, we told you about FEMA camps for years, now it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[02:15:09.566 --> 02:15:10.366]  It's all happening.
[02:15:11.327 --> 02:15:13.368]  Yeah, so this is where I'm confused, Alex.
[02:15:14.221 --> 02:15:16.542]  Am I being duped, or have you been duped?
[02:15:16.882 --> 02:15:31.528]  Because it's like, you're almost like the paparazzi for the Bush family, because you're revealing so many truths, yet you drum up that old paradigm, that age-old drum of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel propaganda.
[02:15:32.329 --> 02:15:35.790]  I mean... I mean, I can't under... I'm totally confused by what you're saying.
[02:15:36.431 --> 02:15:39.753]  Well, I mean, we've been stupid.
[02:15:39.773 --> 02:15:46.796]  The last month, we've been talking about some war over in Israel, when the real war is here on the home front.
[02:15:46.836 --> 02:15:50.398]  You and other guys have been listening to us about Israel, Israel, Israel.
[02:15:50.718 --> 02:15:54.520]  And I'll tell you the truth, man, there is real problems over there.
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:57.502]  I think you went through there on a tour trip.
[02:15:57.562 --> 02:15:58.242]  I've been over there.
[02:15:59.002 --> 02:16:05.127]  I was involved in three suicide bombings where I nearly got killed and people got killed around me.
[02:16:05.347 --> 02:16:05.747]  You know what?
[02:16:06.047 --> 02:16:10.150]  About a minute ago you said anti-Jew or something.
[02:16:10.371 --> 02:16:11.611]  I'm not anti-Israel.
[02:16:12.332 --> 02:16:13.333]  Oh, come on Alex.
[02:16:13.373 --> 02:16:14.534]  Call it the way it is.
[02:16:14.574 --> 02:16:17.055]  You're constantly berating Israel for defending itself.
[02:16:17.296 --> 02:16:20.138]  It's got 200 missiles in its country yesterday.
[02:16:20.158 --> 02:16:22.619]  So hold on just a minute.
[02:16:22.659 --> 02:16:23.440]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:16:25.456 --> 02:16:28.198]  You disagree with me, so I'm going to hold you over.
[02:16:28.739 --> 02:16:30.360]  But I'm going to flesh this out with you.
[02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:32.862]  I'm going to find out exactly what you're saying.
[02:16:33.903 --> 02:16:39.388]  There are probably, there's got to be a hundred plus websites where I'm a SOD agent.
[02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:42.331]  I am an evil, devil Jew.
[02:16:43.471 --> 02:16:49.675]  I am Jewish, which I'm not, but so what if I was?
[02:16:49.695 --> 02:16:50.536]  Nothing wrong with it.
[02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:54.458]  And I have been attacked for not being anti-Israel.
[02:16:55.359 --> 02:16:56.699]  Israel is lying.
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:00.262]  Israel is bombing peaceful targets.
[02:17:01.282 --> 02:17:06.345]  Israel is manipulating our government to a great extent, just like the British are.
[02:17:06.365 --> 02:17:07.186]  I'm mad about that.
[02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:11.091]  Uh, Israel is exacerbating things.
[02:17:11.191 --> 02:17:14.833]  Israel did create fake Al Qaeda groups to bomb itself.
[02:17:15.253 --> 02:17:16.434]  Are you denying that?
[02:17:17.334 --> 02:17:18.314]  Well, let's take a look.
[02:17:18.354 --> 02:17:27.538]  You guys were bringing up the whole incident where, um, it turned out Reuters was actually staging photos and you're blaming Israel for killing 40 innocent people when... Let me ask you a question.
[02:17:27.558 --> 02:17:28.398]  Let me ask you... Well, stay there.
[02:17:28.839 --> 02:17:29.359]  Let me get back.
[02:17:29.599 --> 02:17:34.561]  Are you saying all the CNN and Fox video of blown up buildings and smoking cities, that's fake too?
[02:17:36.209 --> 02:17:41.452]  They probably paid that reporter to put out those fake photos that a five-year-old could tell were fake.
[02:17:41.872 --> 02:17:42.472]  Just stay there.
[02:17:42.792 --> 02:17:43.092]  Stay there.
[02:17:43.112 --> 02:17:43.673]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.893 --> 02:17:47.314]  Your area has just unexpectedly flooded.
[02:17:47.514 --> 02:17:48.355]  The power's out.
[02:17:48.575 --> 02:17:49.355]  So has the water.
[02:17:49.515 --> 02:17:51.016]  And you are thirsty.
[02:17:51.116 --> 02:17:52.216]  But wait outside.
[02:17:52.256 --> 02:17:53.737]  Look, there's lots of water.
[02:17:53.997 --> 02:17:55.058]  And then you see it.
[02:17:55.178 --> 02:17:56.879]  Oh my gosh!
[02:17:57.239 --> 02:17:59.180]  What is that floating in the water?
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.781]  And what is that odor?
[02:18:02.421 --> 02:18:03.182]  No problem.
[02:18:03.382 --> 02:18:06.665]  You thought ahead and own a Berkey water purification system.
[02:18:06.785 --> 02:18:10.608]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply and naturally.
[02:18:10.728 --> 02:18:22.318]  Requiring no power, electricity, or water pressure, the powerful black Berkey elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and yeah, other nasties that might be found in flood water.
[02:18:22.578 --> 02:18:27.383]  Berkey systems can purify treated water during normal times and during unexpected emergencies.
[02:18:27.443 --> 02:18:30.265]  They can get rid of the unhealthy stuff in raw, untreated
[02:18:30.265 --> 02:18:30.465]  Thank you.
[02:18:45.843 --> 02:18:46.883]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:47.284 --> 02:18:52.766]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:53.326 --> 02:18:53.826]  That's right.
[02:18:54.146 --> 02:18:56.427]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:56.767 --> 02:19:03.910]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:04.477 --> 02:19:12.183]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:12.624 --> 02:19:17.428]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:18.087 --> 02:19:23.109]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:23.909 --> 02:19:28.030]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:28.410 --> 02:19:28.670]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:28.690 --> 02:19:30.611]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:30.671 --> 02:19:30.991]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.291 --> 02:19:31.551]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.013 --> 02:19:47.434]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.454 --> 02:19:52.795]  Did you know that the Bible forecasts signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[02:19:52.815 --> 02:19:59.597]  The book of Revelation says that world travel, quickly and efficiently, would be one sign, and also knowledge would increase.
[02:20:00.298 --> 02:20:03.718]  Knowledge is doubling every two and a half years in the electronic industry.
[02:20:04.299 --> 02:20:11.901]  We'd like to help you understand more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:12.741 --> 02:20:14.322]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:14.342 --> 02:20:19.466]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:19.486 --> 02:20:21.727]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:47.951]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:48.171 --> 02:20:51.572]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:51.752 --> 02:20:55.193]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[02:20:55.501 --> 02:20:58.742]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:20:58.762 --> 02:21:04.225]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:21:04.265 --> 02:21:13.889]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:14.029 --> 02:21:15.330]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:21:15.350 --> 02:21:20.812]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:21.292 --> 02:21:25.734]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:25.754 --> 02:21:27.195]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:27.355 --> 02:21:31.177]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:21:31.277 --> 02:21:32.097]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:50.641 --> 02:22:02.048]  Alright, so George Bush's grandfather's a Nazi, and Bush is evil in turning America into a police state, but he totally supports the government of Israel and the widening war and doesn't want to cease fire.
[02:22:02.709 --> 02:22:07.692]  But then I'm bad because now I'm supposedly anti-Israel.
[02:22:09.753 --> 02:22:13.936]  And I guess then half the population in Israel who is against the government.
[02:22:14.898 --> 02:22:17.839]  I guess, and what the government's doing, I guess they're bad too.
[02:22:17.939 --> 02:22:23.421]  I mean, Israel clearly is trying to use these regular military occurrences to escalate this.
[02:22:23.461 --> 02:22:24.281]  So is Hezbollah.
[02:22:24.481 --> 02:22:25.682]  That's how these groups get power.
[02:22:25.922 --> 02:22:34.265]  I'm trying to have a more sophisticated view of this, geopolitically, of what's really going on, leading into World War III, which the neocons in Israel say they want.
[02:22:34.525 --> 02:22:37.806]  And Israel does have official maps, saying they want most of the Middle East.
[02:22:38.426 --> 02:22:39.527]  I have to apologize.
[02:23:05.304 --> 02:23:23.190]  I lived over in the West Bank for a while, and I've been around the PLO, and I've watched a lot of TV over there, and when I came back to the States, that was before 9-11, and so when all the events unfolded, you know, I was pretty wrapped up in a real good understanding of what was going on over there.
[02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:25.631]  The common guy on the street wants to blow up America.
[02:23:25.911 --> 02:23:30.133]  I was afraid to tell people I was American, but if I would take a trip over to Israel,
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:40.427]  And I told somebody I was an American, my gosh, they invited me into their house, we're the greatest country in the world, how they wish their children could live over here, because it was two different worlds.
[02:23:40.487 --> 02:23:45.711]  And so when 9-11 happened, and I'm like you, I told people, I said, it's gonna happen.
[02:23:45.751 --> 02:23:49.313]  In fact, I was at a, somebody knows I like to speak, and so I got invited.
[02:23:49.393 --> 02:23:51.775]  So I'm asking you, sir, who carried out 9-11?
[02:23:51.795 --> 02:23:54.757]  Who carried it out?
[02:23:55.517 --> 02:23:59.220]  I think a good, healthy perspective would be to recognize that
[02:23:59.756 --> 02:24:03.278]  The same organization that carried out the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:09.963]  Yes, and clearly that's elements of our government.
[02:24:10.003 --> 02:24:12.905]  The International Intelligence Agency apparatchik.
[02:24:13.445 --> 02:24:15.586]  Now, you and I love the American people.
[02:24:15.827 --> 02:24:19.409]  You and I are risking our lives and our reputation... No, but listen, listen, listen.
[02:24:19.809 --> 02:24:21.250]  Just stop a minute, Mike.
[02:24:21.350 --> 02:24:22.351]  I'm trying to understand this.
[02:24:23.152 --> 02:24:26.774]  Okay, we know we've got a corrupt, evil government, just like Israel does.
[02:24:26.855 --> 02:24:30.917]  Just like most of these countries, high places are held by evil.
[02:24:31.538 --> 02:24:33.559]  That's world history, that's common sense.
[02:24:34.239 --> 02:24:47.288]  So all I'm telling you is these people want World War III, and it doesn't need to happen, and it's not anti-Israel to say, you know, I don't like Israel, say, selling our weapons secrets to China, or
[02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:54.026]  I don't like Israel manufacturing most of the ecstasy that's shipped into the U.S.
[02:24:54.406 --> 02:24:56.468]  It doesn't mean I hate Israel itself.
[02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:58.531]  This is really confusing.
[02:24:59.431 --> 02:25:00.753]  I don't know where to go with this, sir.
[02:25:01.253 --> 02:25:02.755]  We're probably going to have the government
[02:25:03.806 --> 02:25:27.927]  stage a huge terror attack very very soon in this country and it isn't about Zionists, it isn't about Hitler, it isn't about... it's about evil people want crises so they can use the crises to bring in world government and the people that run world government are Luciferian and they are not Jewish or German or Christian or whatever and so I just... you know...
[02:25:29.412 --> 02:25:34.595]  I've studied this, I've looked at this, and I just don't understand even what you're disagreeing with.
[02:25:44.944 --> 02:25:47.526]  And we present them in the fact that all Israelis are bad.
[02:25:47.566 --> 02:25:53.611]  I mean, they've got a huge militia movement there, much bigger than we could ever hope for, that hates their government.
[02:25:53.931 --> 02:25:57.934]  Those kibbutzes are the militia movement, and the government came after them.
[02:25:57.974 --> 02:26:05.700]  They have M16, because they believe their worst threat wasn't the PLO, but the Israeli government that is controlled by the CIA.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.182]  I'll tell you, when I was in the West Bank, I saw
[02:26:09.097 --> 02:26:27.230]  5 ton diesel pickup trucks drive up, US weapons, brand new US weapons, maybe they're 20 years old but never came out of the storage, brand new US weapons and ammunition with marked US stuff on it, come, because I'm a former Ranger, alright, and I know what these things are, come right to the PLO from the CIA.
[02:26:27.730 --> 02:26:35.115]  We've been helping build Hezbollah because we need this distraction and diffraction in the military.
[02:26:35.335 --> 02:26:37.237]  Sir, that's what Barry Homish says.
[02:26:38.207 --> 02:26:40.549]  I agree.
[02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:42.471]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:26:42.491 --> 02:26:45.473]  You're welcome to call back next week and we can talk more about it.
[02:26:45.493 --> 02:26:49.016]  I've got to get to everybody else, but you just made my point for me.
[02:26:49.977 --> 02:26:51.198]  It's staged!
[02:26:52.299 --> 02:26:57.863]  I don't need to believe you about our government shipping M-16s to the PLO, because I know it's true!
[02:26:59.364 --> 02:27:00.585]  You didn't answer my question.
[02:27:00.725 --> 02:27:07.431]  Haraj and Jerusalem Post have reported that Israel, UPI has too, has created fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[02:27:08.561 --> 02:27:11.382]  Do you understand it's the elite against the people?
[02:27:11.983 --> 02:27:14.203]  Against Christians, against Muslims, against Jews?
[02:27:15.924 --> 02:27:17.025]  Do you understand?
[02:27:17.525 --> 02:27:19.846]  People go, well why would our government fund both sides?
[02:27:20.166 --> 02:27:22.427]  Because it's a wartime government!
[02:27:23.828 --> 02:27:29.410]  They need crises to keep a police state system in place and expand it and have weapon sales.
[02:27:30.210 --> 02:27:33.132]  So yes, I know the Muslims are armed by our government.
[02:27:33.212 --> 02:27:33.812]  I know that!
[02:27:35.033 --> 02:27:35.953]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.413 --> 02:27:37.914]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.946 --> 02:27:41.709]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.592 --> 02:27:47.314]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:27:47.695 --> 02:27:54.221]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[02:27:54.241 --> 02:27:56.163]  That's over 46% savings!
[02:27:56.563 --> 02:27:58.826]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[02:28:00.687 --> 02:28:09.116]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page, so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.
[02:28:09.416 --> 02:28:12.699]  RxDrugCard.com is for anyone who pays for their own prescriptions.

[02:28:16.943 --> 02:28:17.243]  I think so.
[02:28:44.582 --> 02:28:47.023]  Your area has just unexpectedly flooded.
[02:28:47.223 --> 02:28:48.064]  The power's out.
[02:28:48.284 --> 02:28:49.044]  So is the water.
[02:28:49.224 --> 02:28:50.725]  And you are thirsty.
[02:28:50.805 --> 02:28:51.286]  But wait!
[02:28:51.506 --> 02:28:52.146]  Outside, look!
[02:28:52.246 --> 02:28:53.447]  There's lots of water!
[02:28:53.707 --> 02:28:54.787]  And then you see it.
[02:28:55.328 --> 02:28:56.608]  Oh my gosh!
[02:28:56.948 --> 02:28:58.849]  What is that floating in the water?
[02:28:59.390 --> 02:29:01.431]  And what is that odor?
[02:29:02.131 --> 02:29:02.892]  No problem.
[02:29:03.072 --> 02:29:06.354]  You thought ahead and own a Berkey water purification system.
[02:29:06.494 --> 02:29:10.317]  Berkey has revolutionized the way water is purified simply and naturally.
[02:29:10.437 --> 02:29:22.024]  Requiring no power, electricity, or water pressure, the powerful black Berkey elements extract pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, heavy metals, and yeah, other nasties that might be found in flood water.
[02:29:22.265 --> 02:29:27.088]  Berkey systems can purify treated water during normal times and during unexpected emergencies.
[02:29:27.128 --> 02:29:30.470]  They can get rid of the unhealthy stuff in raw, untreated water.
[02:29:31.971 --> 02:29:32.531]  We're good to go.
[02:30:00.776 --> 02:30:02.497]  It's time to take back your health.

[02:30:44.957 --> 02:30:47.278]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:47.858 --> 02:30:50.639]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:59.409 --> 02:31:20.557]  I'm going to run through five more calls, and then I'm going to play this little part of this apocalypse clip, one of massive, I don't know how many of these are on, and I've got five or six we found, and it's all over the newspapers, from the news, that we're going to, the apocalypse is coming, Ahmadinejad is probably going to start World War III in 11 days, the 22nd.
[02:31:21.457 --> 02:31:28.700]  Then you read the Wall Street Journal article, the professor that came up with it, and he admits he has no proof of it.
[02:31:29.675 --> 02:31:30.536]  He just says it.
[02:31:32.016 --> 02:31:33.397]  I mean, you talk about propaganda.
[02:31:33.617 --> 02:31:36.299]  Can you imagine the Muslims over there read our newspapers?
[02:31:36.339 --> 02:31:38.080]  They actually are into the news and actually read.
[02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:45.404]  And they're hearing that they all need to die, we need to nuke them, race-specific bioweapons, let's kill them all.
[02:31:47.665 --> 02:31:52.347]  And it's still the minority of the Muslims that are shooting their mouths off saying, let's kill all the Westerners.
[02:31:53.868 --> 02:31:55.589]  I'm not siding with anybody here!
[02:31:55.969 --> 02:31:57.550]  I don't want World War III, folks!
[02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:58.491]  I want to live in peace!
[02:32:00.745 --> 02:32:01.505]  This is sick!
[02:32:03.886 --> 02:32:08.526]  You know, the caller brings up the fact that our government's driving up, arming the PLO.
[02:32:08.566 --> 02:32:09.787]  Well, of course they are!
[02:32:11.407 --> 02:32:15.968]  And it's no secret that they armed the provisional government over there.
[02:32:16.808 --> 02:32:24.309]  It's just like putting Saddam in power, giving him $30 billion plus, telling him to attack Iran, telling him to go ahead and go in Kuwait, then shutting him up.
[02:32:24.769 --> 02:32:25.469]  It's on record!
[02:32:25.509 --> 02:32:27.090]  Our government said, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[02:32:27.350 --> 02:32:27.990]  It's on record!
[02:32:28.270 --> 02:32:29.370]  This is admitted!
[02:32:31.474 --> 02:32:37.640]  But the general public doesn't know what year 9-11 happened, much less what happened in 1990, 1991.
[02:32:39.302 --> 02:32:40.543]  They probably think that happened in 2000.
[02:32:40.583 --> 02:32:43.526]  There's just no connection.
[02:32:43.806 --> 02:32:45.428]  We are literally under mass mind control.
[02:32:45.788 --> 02:32:47.730]  The general public is mesmerized.
[02:32:48.030 --> 02:32:49.251]  These people know nothing.
[02:32:50.535 --> 02:32:58.297]  I keep repeating that because it's just now starting to come home to roost to me just how stupid about half the population is.
[02:32:58.517 --> 02:33:06.278]  It's not even stupid, it's like they're zombies, they're mesmerized and they don't have any information.
[02:33:06.338 --> 02:33:12.499]  I guess they just go through life and don't even think about how things work or who's behind what or history.
[02:33:12.519 --> 02:33:13.860]  They have no grasp of anything.
[02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:16.020]  They're basically like stupid animals.
[02:33:18.303 --> 02:33:22.025]  So of course the globalists are behind both sides.
[02:33:22.085 --> 02:33:23.646]  That's why they're in control.
[02:33:23.886 --> 02:33:26.408]  That's why they'll be in control until we figure it out.
[02:33:27.649 --> 02:33:30.350]  They're behind the terrorists, they're behind the response.
[02:33:32.632 --> 02:33:39.956]  They'll then be behind most of the opposition, but they're losing that monopoly because of the internet, because people are finally at least a cross-section
[02:33:41.229 --> 02:33:43.050]  Of society is getting more sophisticated.
[02:33:43.090 --> 02:33:50.393]  Okay, I said though I'd do a brief explanation of why I think we're going to see a terror attack in the next two months, unless we get the word out to stop it.
[02:33:53.054 --> 02:34:04.419]  For those that haven't tuned in before, let me just tell you, there's video of it, there's audio of it, it's all over the web, it's on record, that July 25th, 2001, I launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[02:34:05.316 --> 02:34:06.137]  And said that the U.S.
[02:34:06.177 --> 02:34:13.224]  government criminal elements would stage terror attacks on the World Trade Center and probably blame their asset Bin Laden for the attacks.
[02:34:14.465 --> 02:34:15.766]  And I said a lot more than that.
[02:34:16.587 --> 02:34:17.388]  That's on record.
[02:34:17.428 --> 02:34:20.731]  Well now, for the second time only, and we can stop it!
[02:34:22.313 --> 02:34:27.938]  Now again, it's not like I'm always making these predictions and then going, oh, we stopped it, see, it didn't happen.
[02:34:27.958 --> 02:34:28.579]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:28.959 --> 02:34:29.920]  I'm not doing that!
[02:34:31.073 --> 02:34:35.194]  I've said there's going to be an attack, and I've given specifics one time.
[02:34:36.794 --> 02:34:37.114]  Okay?
[02:34:37.154 --> 02:34:38.835]  And now I'm telling you we can stop it.
[02:34:38.855 --> 02:34:40.215]  And of course, I'm going to be attacked.
[02:34:40.675 --> 02:34:42.855]  I'm going to be attacked if we do stop it.
[02:34:43.476 --> 02:34:45.336]  But I'm willing to take one for the team, folks.
[02:34:46.536 --> 02:34:46.796]  Okay?
[02:34:46.816 --> 02:34:50.177]  People will take what I've said out of context, and that's fine and dandy.
[02:34:52.357 --> 02:34:55.098]  So let me be clear about this.
[02:34:56.738 --> 02:35:21.143]  If we call them to talk radio shows, if we call them to C-SPAN, if we call our congressmen, if we spread the word to our neighbors, believe me, the NSA is sampling this, they're listening on radio, phones, everywhere, they have little graphs they look at for what percentage of the public is aware of 9-11 being an inside job, they look at the public polls, they cross-reference all of that, and if
[02:35:23.271 --> 02:35:30.876]  They hear enough of us speaking out, getting involved, exposing 9-11 as an inside job, pointing out that all of the ingredients are there.
[02:35:30.916 --> 02:35:32.777]  They're saying World War III is about to start.
[02:35:33.077 --> 02:35:35.218]  They're saying Iran is about to start Armageddon.
[02:35:35.518 --> 02:35:38.080]  They're saying that Hezbollah and Hamas is in the U.S.
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:38.760]  and going to kill us.
[02:35:39.201 --> 02:35:41.622]  They're hyping all this, and those indicators come together.
[02:35:41.942 --> 02:35:46.085]  I see the pattern I saw before for massive terror attacks.
[02:35:48.539 --> 02:35:53.201]  Now in the first hour I went over what I think those attacks may look like and how they'll respond.
[02:35:54.702 --> 02:35:59.924]  And you can, we now re-air the show for 23 hours, or excuse me, 21 hours afterwards.
[02:36:01.184 --> 02:36:04.145]  As soon as it's broadcast in today's, it will re-loop.
[02:36:05.546 --> 02:36:12.469]  It will loop again for you until we start back up on Monday.
[02:36:13.709 --> 02:36:15.850]  This show today will run all weekend.
[02:36:16.490 --> 02:36:18.051]  It will run until Monday.
[02:36:19.036 --> 02:36:21.718]  Friday I guess is the only show that ends up airing for a couple days.
[02:36:21.778 --> 02:36:24.941]  Normally it just relapses for 21 hours.
[02:36:25.801 --> 02:36:33.067]  But you can listen during the first hour and you'll be able to hear the full basic info rant.
[02:36:33.227 --> 02:36:37.970]  I guess it's an info rant is a good term for it in that first hour.
[02:36:40.012 --> 02:36:44.015]  The fake terror alerts, the busting these patsies, the hype,
[02:36:44.914 --> 02:36:53.420]  Israel going into Lebanon, all of this coming together, the fear-mongering, especially now that Bush is getting approval rating boost from this.
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:55.961]  These busts were a trial balloon.
[02:36:56.001 --> 02:37:05.107]  There is a very good chance, in fact I see it happening, unless we have a maximum output out there to wake everybody up.
[02:37:06.969 --> 02:37:10.251]  You know my mother had a surprise birthday party last night and
[02:37:11.661 --> 02:37:22.926]  She came over to my house and one of her friends was there, one of my family friends, and she said, yeah, you know, I got friends calling me up during work going, oh Alex, your buddy's saying the government's behind these alerts.
[02:37:24.046 --> 02:37:24.987]  What do you say to that?
[02:37:25.007 --> 02:37:32.530]  Hey, why don't you just call into the show instead of calling up somebody that you know knows me, that I'm bad because
[02:37:33.365 --> 02:37:34.526]  She says, you've got a couple culls.
[02:37:35.146 --> 02:37:39.268]  I'm bad because I don't want to cower in fear that the Muslims are going to get me.
[02:37:39.709 --> 02:37:42.030]  The government staged these things over and over again.
[02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:43.871]  The British are the worst at it.
[02:37:44.832 --> 02:37:48.314]  I mean, they're the most egregious, and they've been caught doing it over and over again.
[02:37:48.334 --> 02:37:50.415]  And so I'm not going to believe this story.
[02:37:50.895 --> 02:37:54.117]  If somebody lies to me over and over and over and over and over again,
[02:37:54.935 --> 02:37:59.336]  And then tells everybody they've got to dump their bottles out and all this other baloney.
[02:37:59.356 --> 02:38:00.656]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:38:00.957 --> 02:38:02.477]  Look at the timing of all of this.
[02:38:02.857 --> 02:38:03.597]  And you watch.
[02:38:03.657 --> 02:38:05.038]  It's going to come out at stage.
[02:38:06.258 --> 02:38:08.898]  And by the way, it isn't my spin that it comes out at stage.
[02:38:09.199 --> 02:38:11.579]  They come out and later admit it's staged.
[02:38:12.019 --> 02:38:14.800]  Or it just disappears and they release whoever they arrest.
[02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:19.061]  And they do this over and over and over again.
[02:38:19.736 --> 02:38:21.216]  So we've written articles about this.
[02:38:21.296 --> 02:38:22.377]  We've documented this.
[02:38:22.717 --> 02:38:25.157]  We're going to write more articles about it over the weekend.
[02:38:27.018 --> 02:38:33.399]  Bottom line, the government is getting ready to stage a war provocation to blame it on Hezbollah and claim Iran did it or Syria did it.
[02:38:34.400 --> 02:38:35.240]  They have to have it.
[02:38:35.660 --> 02:38:37.080]  They've got to have a Lusitania.
[02:38:37.300 --> 02:38:38.841]  They've got to have a USS Maine.
[02:38:39.281 --> 02:38:40.641]  They've got to have a 9-11.
[02:38:40.961 --> 02:38:42.942]  They've got to have some new provocation.
[02:38:43.002 --> 02:38:48.043]  Every time they launch a new war, they have a big terror event to kick it off.
[02:38:49.088 --> 02:38:51.229]  And I'm seeing the exact same pattern again at 100%.
[02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:56.993]  They got it turned up on high right now, and so it's not very hard to predict.
[02:38:58.414 --> 02:38:58.774]  Okay?
[02:38:59.974 --> 02:39:09.160]  But I think we've got the listeners, and through this kind of tree that we have, because we have a certain amount of listeners, but then you know a certain amount of people, and they know a certain amount of people.
[02:39:10.777 --> 02:39:27.484]  And we have all these other activist groups that if we get the word out now, if we get involved now, if we get really aggressive now about government-sponsored terror and how before every major war, World War I, World War II, Vietnam, with the Gulf of Tonkin, these are all kicked off by a major provocation.
[02:39:27.825 --> 02:39:33.807]  USS Liberty, 1967, that was a staged event to try to kick off World War III then.
[02:39:33.827 --> 02:39:36.168]  I mean, I've had the admirals on to tell you that.
[02:39:36.949 --> 02:39:37.889]  This isn't my opinion.
[02:39:39.082 --> 02:39:40.363]  They're trying it again!
[02:39:40.483 --> 02:39:41.484]  We can stop them!
[02:39:43.065 --> 02:39:49.549]  Captain William L. McGonagall kept that ship afloat while they were bombing it and strafing it for hour after hour and torpedoing it.
[02:39:50.509 --> 02:39:55.892]  And if they'd have sunk that thing and killed all aboard and strafed the life rafts, we would have had World War III.
[02:39:55.912 --> 02:39:56.813]  We'd be in a different world.
[02:39:57.373 --> 02:40:00.875]  God uses us to fight this evil and to stop it.
[02:40:01.856 --> 02:40:03.717]  Now again, I'm not against Israel.
[02:40:03.777 --> 02:40:04.838]  I'm not against the Muslims.
[02:40:04.898 --> 02:40:05.899]  I'm not against the Arabs.
[02:40:06.179 --> 02:40:08.060]  I'm for the people of this planet.
[02:40:09.753 --> 02:40:12.295]  And we don't need or want World War III.
[02:40:12.335 --> 02:40:14.236]  There's nothing macho or cool about it.
[02:40:14.276 --> 02:40:15.777]  This war is against us.
[02:40:16.717 --> 02:40:18.478]  This war is against our liberties.
[02:40:19.319 --> 02:40:20.920]  We've got to fight it and stop it now.
[02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:23.381]  Alright, let's go to the calls quickly now.
[02:40:24.782 --> 02:40:26.663]  Brian in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:40:26.703 --> 02:40:27.044]  Welcome.
[02:40:28.164 --> 02:40:30.986]  Alex, thanks for waking me up.
[02:40:31.046 --> 02:40:33.347]  I've been listening to you for over two years now.
[02:40:34.288 --> 02:40:35.869]  And I gotta tell you,
[02:40:36.957 --> 02:40:39.699]  I can just see these things when they happen now.
[02:40:39.739 --> 02:40:41.680]  It's like a second sense to me.
[02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:48.683]  I can understand exactly what the government's doing, what these people are doing, that are controlling these events.
[02:40:49.264 --> 02:40:54.886]  Well, criminals and criminology shows the psychology of the criminal.
[02:40:55.247 --> 02:40:57.308]  There's a few subsets, but it's basically the same.
[02:40:57.628 --> 02:40:58.528]  It's to repeat.
[02:40:58.989 --> 02:41:00.069]  It's a repetition.
[02:41:00.429 --> 02:41:02.771]  So really, they do the same thing over and over again.
[02:41:02.791 --> 02:41:03.071]  Go ahead.
[02:41:05.734 --> 02:41:08.856]  You know, we need to support you, Alex, every way that we can.
[02:41:08.876 --> 02:41:10.518]  I love my Berkey water filter.
[02:41:10.538 --> 02:41:18.804]  I support... I'm a member of GCNlive.com, and by the way, that is the best way to listen to your show.
[02:41:18.824 --> 02:41:30.913]  I'm also a PrisonPlanet.tv member, and I've gotten copies of all of your books and movies.
[02:41:31.454 --> 02:41:31.694]  I mean,
[02:41:32.665 --> 02:41:34.746]  The work that you're doing is just outstanding.
[02:41:34.766 --> 02:41:36.586]  Your analysis is right on the mark.
[02:41:36.606 --> 02:41:39.987]  Well, thank you for putting that in there, because without you, sir, we wouldn't be here.
[02:41:40.608 --> 02:41:41.368]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:41.828 --> 02:41:42.768]  What else is on your mind?
[02:41:45.409 --> 02:41:53.232]  How about the fact that the Israeli flag is actually the coat of arms of the Rothschild family?
[02:41:54.993 --> 02:41:55.833]  Well, I knew that.
[02:41:55.853 --> 02:41:57.713]  You know, they call it the Star of David.
[02:41:57.753 --> 02:41:58.814]  That is not true.
[02:41:59.534 --> 02:42:00.394]  This is official.
[02:42:00.434 --> 02:42:01.415]  This is historical.
[02:42:01.475 --> 02:42:02.275]  Go research.
[02:42:03.557 --> 02:42:07.299]  Type into Google, Origins of Star of David.
[02:42:07.319 --> 02:42:09.521]  It will tell you that it is the seal.
[02:42:10.942 --> 02:42:14.164]  Now this is Jewish lore, but I'm going to break this down.
[02:42:14.805 --> 02:42:15.705]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:42:15.725 --> 02:42:16.846]  Let me comment on that briefly.
[02:42:18.207 --> 02:42:20.849]  Solomon was supposedly the wisest man that ever lived.
[02:42:20.949 --> 02:42:22.790]  But he wasn't a man after God's own heart.
[02:42:23.131 --> 02:42:24.071]  It was David's son.
[02:42:24.492 --> 02:42:26.553]  And he married all these women, hundreds of them.
[02:42:27.734 --> 02:42:29.415]  I forget how many hundreds of wives he had.
[02:42:29.996 --> 02:42:31.717]  And a bunch of them were into black magic.
[02:42:33.991 --> 02:42:35.051]  By the way, this is in the Bible.
[02:42:35.532 --> 02:42:40.393]  And so, King Solomon was conjuring genies, spirits, demons.
[02:42:41.854 --> 02:42:48.316]  And he got into a bunch of trouble and tried to repent about it, but finally he was having trouble with all these demons.
[02:42:48.616 --> 02:42:49.496]  This is where it comes from.
[02:42:50.017 --> 02:42:55.799]  And the Star of David is really the Star of Solomon, and it's not called the Star of Solomon either.
[02:42:55.999 --> 02:42:57.179]  Those are the two false names.
[02:42:57.239 --> 02:42:59.380]  It's the Seal of Solomon.
[02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:02.221]  It's the Seal of Solomon.
[02:43:03.115 --> 02:43:11.739]  And he came up with this symbol that sealed the genie in the bottle.
[02:43:12.239 --> 02:43:13.620]  Okay, so that's what it is.
[02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:16.301]  It's a black magic seal.
[02:43:17.382 --> 02:43:21.664]  And that's what it is, and so that's what's on the Israeli flag.
[02:43:21.684 --> 02:43:28.287]  So, there you know, it's not the Star of David, it's not the Star of Solomon, it is the Seal of Solomon.
[02:43:29.315 --> 02:43:30.156]  It is occultic.
[02:43:30.276 --> 02:43:39.561]  It is one of the most powerful, and this is even in black magic books, official reprints of 15th century black magic books.
[02:43:39.581 --> 02:43:52.129]  Because I've gone and studied it to make Dark Secrets Inside a Bohemian Grove, I went and looked at it, and it is supposedly one of the most, if not the most, powerful seals to control demons.
[02:43:53.169 --> 02:43:57.112]  Okay, it's like having a pentagram for your symbol, folks.
[02:43:58.216 --> 02:44:02.098]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:44:03.219 --> 02:44:06.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick in California.
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:06.760]  Rick, go ahead.
[02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:22.208]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to let you know that I wrote a song inspired by you and it's called Big Brother is Watching You and Kevin Booth is going to be, I believe he's going to be using a little bit of it in his new documentary American Drug War.
[02:44:22.388 --> 02:44:22.848]  Oh good!
[02:44:23.448 --> 02:44:25.469]  When is Kevin's new film coming out?
[02:44:26.149 --> 02:44:27.150]  I think it should be out like
[02:44:27.908 --> 02:44:29.188]  In a few weeks, I'm imagining.
[02:44:31.029 --> 02:44:38.131]  What I did is I put the song up on the internet for you to download it because I want to dedicate it to your show and give you permission to use it for whatever.
[02:44:38.151 --> 02:44:38.871]  Oh, well thank you.
[02:44:38.911 --> 02:44:39.411]  Where is it?
[02:44:40.192 --> 02:44:49.254]  If you go to MySpace.com slash Rebel Soul Band, that's Rebel Soul Band, and it's the first song on there, and you can just download it right off there.
[02:44:49.274 --> 02:44:51.475]  Are you a member of MyMySpace?
[02:44:52.705 --> 02:44:53.465]  I am, actually.
[02:44:53.926 --> 02:44:57.227]  It'd be easier for folks if you just post it right there.
[02:44:57.287 --> 02:44:58.628]  People can go there right now and get it.
[02:44:59.588 --> 02:45:00.869]  Okay, I'll go do that right now.
[02:45:01.449 --> 02:45:05.251]  That way, because I didn't write down the site you said, that way I can go listen to it myself.
[02:45:06.151 --> 02:45:06.832]  Yeah, that'd be great.
[02:45:07.152 --> 02:45:08.072]  I would appreciate that.
[02:45:08.092 --> 02:45:09.693]  What else is on your mind, Rick?
[02:45:11.594 --> 02:45:20.258]  Well, I just enjoy listening to your show and definitely it educates me and opens up my mind to think about things in a different way.
[02:45:21.121 --> 02:45:25.504]  I haven't thought about it before, so I just want to say thanks for that, and you inspire me.
[02:45:25.764 --> 02:45:26.744]  Well, thank you.
[02:45:27.164 --> 02:45:27.725]  God bless you.
[02:45:27.745 --> 02:45:28.165]  Take care.
[02:45:28.205 --> 02:45:31.727]  You know, I think about, wow, there's all these people writing me poetry.
[02:45:32.147 --> 02:45:33.368]  They're making music.
[02:45:34.289 --> 02:45:35.469]  I better do a good job.
[02:45:35.509 --> 02:45:37.150]  There's all these great people counting on me.
[02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:39.692]  Listen, listen, I mean this when I say it.
[02:45:39.712 --> 02:45:41.993]  I want to thank you, okay?
[02:45:43.115 --> 02:45:44.015]  I mean, I work hard.
[02:45:44.055 --> 02:45:45.156]  I do a pretty good job.
[02:45:45.256 --> 02:45:47.077]  I fall down sometimes like everybody else.
[02:45:47.137 --> 02:45:47.777]  I'm not perfect.
[02:45:48.117 --> 02:45:49.617]  But we really try as best we can.
[02:45:49.658 --> 02:45:51.178]  But I deserve some credit.
[02:45:51.218 --> 02:45:52.979]  My crew really deserves a lot of credit.
[02:45:53.839 --> 02:45:55.460]  All the folks that work in here in my office.
[02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:57.861]  They know that we're really having an effect.
[02:45:57.901 --> 02:45:59.201]  We really are changing history.
[02:45:59.541 --> 02:46:01.122]  But none of that happens without you.
[02:46:01.302 --> 02:46:04.983]  You, the listeners, give the work we've done the legs.
[02:46:05.023 --> 02:46:06.064]  You give it the power.
[02:46:06.144 --> 02:46:09.445]  You give it the oomph behind everything.
[02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:22.851]  And so I just want to thank you and commend you and let you know that I'm very humble and don't think I do a very good job in a lot of respects and I'm trying hard for you and I appreciate the confidence you've put in me.
[02:46:23.771 --> 02:46:32.438]  I appreciate the love you've given me and I appreciate everything you've done and I'm trying my best to live up to the type of support you've given me.
[02:46:32.999 --> 02:46:34.100]  So thank you so much.
[02:46:34.736 --> 02:46:37.742]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Chicago.
[02:46:37.822 --> 02:46:38.483]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:46:38.503 --> 02:46:39.565]  Hey, Alex.
[02:46:40.527 --> 02:46:45.256]  We say the same thing back to you, and you have really done the job, and I think right now it's time to double the efforts.
[02:46:46.229 --> 02:46:47.090]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:47:06.201 --> 02:47:08.522]  We know this subject pretty much in and out.
[02:47:08.602 --> 02:47:12.063]  We have to go out now and proselytize among the masses.
[02:47:12.403 --> 02:47:15.244]  We have literally the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:15.444 --> 02:47:20.605]  We have to go out now as ambassadors to aggressively proselytize.
[02:47:21.085 --> 02:47:27.007]  And what I noticed on your show is the same reaction, whether it's Morgan Reynolds, whether it's Mike Malloy,
[02:47:27.737 --> 02:47:28.637]  I don't know.
[02:47:28.717 --> 02:47:29.198]  I don't know.
[02:47:48.015 --> 02:47:49.156]  Look for it for themselves.
[02:47:49.236 --> 02:47:51.037]  And those two things are so powerful.
[02:47:51.097 --> 02:47:57.040]  On my site I feature them on 911essentials.com and I really want people to go there and just get the videos.
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:14.951]  It's all the links to your page, your sites, it's the links to your videos, it's links to your Sunday show, which again, I'd like to congratulate that program director there at KLBJ who's got the guts to do this and to put you in mainstream radio, which I think is going to really happen here.
[02:48:14.991 --> 02:48:15.591]  And I predict
[02:48:16.304 --> 02:48:22.246]  Alex, there may be a little bit of time, but when this takes off and when people start going, you're going to be up there with you-know-who.
[02:48:22.266 --> 02:48:24.566]  I don't even want to say his name.
[02:48:24.947 --> 02:48:26.067]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:48:26.107 --> 02:48:26.647]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:26.687 --> 02:48:27.167]  I'm out of time.
[02:48:27.767 --> 02:48:32.689]  Look, I can already get a bigger audience and higher ratings just because I'm telling the truth to those people.
[02:48:33.129 --> 02:48:34.969]  But believe me, I've already talked to all the big networks.
[02:48:35.009 --> 02:48:35.950]  They've contacted us.
[02:48:36.310 --> 02:48:37.770]  They know this show would go huge.
[02:48:39.311 --> 02:48:43.572]  We are on a lot of official stations, and KLBJ is big, so we're excited about it.
[02:48:47.666 --> 02:48:48.146]  It's here!
[02:48:48.367 --> 02:48:53.150]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.510 --> 02:49:01.176]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.856 --> 02:49:08.901]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.301 --> 02:49:16.186]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:16.676 --> 02:49:20.719]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.019 --> 02:49:24.542]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.003 --> 02:49:26.904]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.244 --> 02:49:31.167]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.423 --> 02:49:45.203]  Terrorism!
[02:49:45.343 --> 02:49:46.103]  Terrorism!
[02:49:46.203 --> 02:49:52.265]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:49:52.525 --> 02:49:54.105]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:49:54.365 --> 02:49:56.826]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:49:57.226 --> 02:50:11.789]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:11.829 --> 02:50:12.129]  government.
[02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:14.089]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:50:14.489 --> 02:50:20.414]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:20.554 --> 02:50:25.037]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:51:48.805 --> 02:51:51.227]  We had a whole bunch of clips today I wanted to play.
[02:51:52.503 --> 02:51:58.970]  One of them's Lou Dobbs saying this government can't be trusted, has no credibility, and there should be a full, new, truly independent investigation.
[02:51:59.471 --> 02:52:02.634]  Before that, the reporter's talking about how this is fueled conspiracy theories.
[02:52:03.355 --> 02:52:04.657]  Here's just a short clip of it.
[02:52:04.697 --> 02:52:06.258]  Here's Lou Dobbs last night.
[02:52:07.199 --> 02:52:12.926]  Still, so far, government investigators stopped short of calling all these inaccuracies lies.
[02:52:14.392 --> 02:52:22.835]  Investigations are underway by the Inspectors General of the Pentagon and the Department of Transportation to find out just why the FAA and NORAD didn't tell the truth.
[02:52:23.316 --> 02:52:31.639]  Now, Cain and Hamilton say all the inaccuracies have fueled conspiracy theorists, they've stymied the investigation, and they've damaged the credibility of this government.
[02:52:32.419 --> 02:52:35.440]  Well, this government doesn't deserve much credibility, does it?
[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:42.223]  In point of fact, if all of the after-action reports are untrue, for whatever reason,
[02:52:42.925 --> 02:52:47.567]  That's a lie, because they are asserted as the truth by people who knew better or should have.
[02:52:47.687 --> 02:52:57.731]  And really troubling, the Department of Defense own Inspector General report that was declassified showed that if the same thing happened again, you have the same chaos and the same misreporting or lies afterward.
[02:52:58.672 --> 02:53:07.856]  Incompetence and ineptitude on the part of this government, on September 11th and in the weeks and months leading up to it, are established.
[02:53:08.496 --> 02:53:11.217]  The fact that the government would permit deception
[02:53:12.103 --> 02:53:19.328]  After a deception, whether honestly, if you can call it that, honestly intended, or not.
[02:53:19.969 --> 02:53:33.919]  But the fact that they would continue and perpetuate the lie suggests that we need a full investigation of what is going on, what is demonstrably and incompetent, and at worst, deceitful federal government.
[02:53:36.009 --> 02:53:37.230]  All right, folks.
[02:53:37.610 --> 02:53:40.491]  The point is, we're getting real close to cooking these turkeys.
[02:53:40.651 --> 02:53:41.892]  And Ludovic isn't stupid.
[02:53:41.912 --> 02:53:43.212]  He knows it's an inside job.
[02:53:43.372 --> 02:53:44.093]  Everybody knows.
[02:53:44.113 --> 02:53:46.514]  So I was talking to an LAPD detective.
[02:53:46.534 --> 02:53:48.135]  He goes, Alex, we've known for years.
[02:53:48.175 --> 02:53:48.835]  We all know.
[02:53:49.475 --> 02:53:58.659]  Anybody who isn't a naive moron, people who are so cowardly, people who are smart are, they decide to not believe it.
[02:53:59.019 --> 02:54:01.060]  You know the official story is impossible.
[02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:02.641]  You know it's a fraud.
[02:54:03.564 --> 02:54:06.325]  And then you look at all the evidence, the people who have the motive are behind it!
[02:54:06.585 --> 02:54:08.385]  Surprise, surprise, the globalists!
[02:54:08.905 --> 02:54:11.125]  And I will be on KLBJ from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:11.165 --> 02:54:13.126]  Central, that's 5 to 7 p.m.
[02:54:14.086 --> 02:54:14.506]  Eastern.
[02:54:15.126 --> 02:54:18.927]  I guess that'd be, what, 2 to 4 p.m.
[02:54:19.047 --> 02:54:22.608]  Pacific, 3 to 5 p.m.
[02:54:22.668 --> 02:54:23.108]  Mountain.
[02:54:23.608 --> 02:54:30.329]  You can listen via Infowars.com, the stream there, coming up on Sunday, and we'll cover whatever new developments there have been.
[02:54:31.485 --> 02:54:35.247]  On that Sunday show, and I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:54:35.547 --> 02:54:37.928]  Mike in Texas, last caller, all we have time for.
[02:54:38.208 --> 02:54:38.828]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:48.292]  Alex, listen, I have a friend of mine that works for the NRO in Washington, D.C., and I got into an argument with him about six months ago.
[02:54:48.312 --> 02:54:56.336]  I've kind of been sitting back just watching everything take place, and it is absolutely true as you have said it from the beginning.
[02:54:56.876 --> 02:55:00.958]  There is footage of the supposed Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon.
[02:55:01.477 --> 02:55:02.597]  I got into it with him.
[02:55:02.657 --> 02:55:04.298]  I said, why don't you release it?
[02:55:04.838 --> 02:55:10.160]  He said, we don't release it because it will, you know, it's too tragic for people to relive it again.
[02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:11.941]  I said, that's a crock of you-know-what.
[02:55:12.421 --> 02:55:14.342]  And it just went on and on from there.
[02:55:14.522 --> 02:55:19.524]  So you were talking to somebody at the Naval Reconnaissance or National Reconnaissance Office?
[02:55:20.384 --> 02:55:20.724]  Yes.
[02:55:21.024 --> 02:55:24.406]  And so he said that he knows they've got footage but won't release it.
[02:55:24.946 --> 02:55:25.486]  He's seen it.
[02:55:27.051 --> 02:55:32.573]  Well, of course they've got it, and whether it's real or manufactured, they're going to release it to try to discredit this movement.
[02:55:32.894 --> 02:55:35.155]  That's why they've always made it the number one topic.
[02:55:36.255 --> 02:55:43.178]  And if I might talk about the new movie, The World Trade Center, I went and saw it a couple days.
[02:55:43.658 --> 02:55:44.619]  It is terrible.
[02:55:45.139 --> 02:55:47.800]  It's ridiculous that Oliver Stone even made it.
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:50.961]  It's really not even a high-class A film.
[02:55:51.301 --> 02:55:52.442]  It's like a C film.
[02:55:52.924 --> 02:56:01.386]  And in it, in the first 20 minutes, one of the firefighters, you know, that's an actor, said that, you know, they're walking down the hallway before the tower, the first tower collapsed.
[02:56:01.807 --> 02:56:04.327]  And he said, did you hear that a Pentagon got hit?
[02:56:04.367 --> 02:56:05.488]  They said a missile hit it.
[02:56:05.908 --> 02:56:12.570]  And then right at the end of the movie, they bring up, like, like Lou Dobbs talking in the background, but it's not him, it's somebody else.
[02:56:12.590 --> 02:56:13.230]  Hey, I'm out of time.
[02:56:13.270 --> 02:56:13.810]  Gotta let you go.
[02:56:13.870 --> 02:56:14.370]  God bless you.
[02:56:14.610 --> 02:56:18.611]  Folks, get your tickets for the big event we got, 9-11 event in Dallas on the 26th.
[02:56:18.952 --> 02:56:19.272]  Get them.
[02:56:19.492 --> 02:56:20.352]  God bless you all.
