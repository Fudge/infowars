[00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:06.068]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:07.809]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.590]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.071]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:12.752]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:17.054]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:21.636]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.802]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:36.143]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:46.732]  We have Michael Rivero with his once-a-month visit coming up in the next hour from Hawaii, the webmaster and man behind WhatReallyHappened.com.
[00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:50.175]  We were going to have him on yesterday, but we had some scheduling conflicts.
[00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:54.639]  We do have the folks doing the Boston Tea Party, throwing the...
[00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:00.952]  9-11 Whitewash Commission books into Boston Harbor, also San Francisco Harbor.
[00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:02.512]  That's coming up Saturday.
[00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:06.113]  He'll be on with us about 15-20 minutes in the third hour.
[00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:11.574]  I'm also lining up one of the Watson brothers with big breaking news that's developed concerning 7-7.
[00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:15.755]  We'll tell you about that even before they come on with us later.
[00:01:17.155 --> 00:01:21.056]  In the meantime, I've got a lot of important news here in front of me.
[00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:23.076]  But things like this...
[00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:30.614]  Though they seem petty, illustrate the type of psychological dictatorship that this country is becoming.
[00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:34.616]  Trees being returned at Sea-Tac Airport.
[00:01:36.156 --> 00:01:37.957]  And this is in Washington State.
[00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:43.360]  Christmas trees are going back up at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.762]  A rabbi had seen the trees and was upset by them.
[00:01:49.827 --> 00:01:55.329]  And demanded that it be taken down, and they jumped to and took them down.
[00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.593]  Now, the Muslims also want their own private prayer rooms in all of our airports.
[00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:09.375]  Even though the airports, and I've walked by them, no one's ever in them.
[00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:13.637]  I've been all over the country, all over the world, and you see the meditation rooms.
[00:02:14.257 --> 00:02:15.298]  No religious symbols.
[00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.894]  Sometimes it's one big room I've looked in.
[00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:20.316]  Sometimes it's multiple rooms.
[00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:22.057]  No one's using them.
[00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:24.039]  Meditation rooms.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.821]  Religious rooms.
[00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.262]  And that's not good enough.
[00:02:30.304 --> 00:02:31.044]  It's not good enough.
[00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:33.006]  Take down your cannon bomb.
[00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:35.508]  Take down your Christmas tree.
[00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.391]  Take down your Germanic fertility tree.
[00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.575]  And put up our menorah.
[00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:47.683]  Personally, I could care less about either one of the symbols.
[00:02:50.184 --> 00:02:51.584]  I mean, a Christmas tree is pretty.
[00:02:51.684 --> 00:02:52.865]  It's occultic as heck.
[00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:55.525]  It has nothing to do with Christmas.
[00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:57.626]  It's a Germanic fertility tree.
[00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:04.828]  In the dark of winter, they would take an evergreen into the hut because it was seen as everlasting.
[00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:12.311]  It was seen as braving the winter and so they could remember what the sun was like and hope for its return.
[00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.471]  That's what happened.
[00:03:17.512 --> 00:03:21.195]  And you don't expect the Germans to quit doing what they were doing once they were Christianized.
[00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.037]  So the Christmas trees caught on.
[00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.999]  C'est la vie.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.647]  The point is, this is the type of country we've become where illegal aliens can get bank accounts without ID cards.
[00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:37.629]  And home loans, but citizens can't.
[00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.472]  And where a rabbi doesn't like a
[00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.434]  Christmas tree, and so he demands it's taken down, like he's God, and it's done.
[00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:51.076]  When he says jump, they say how high.
[00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:58.921]  And when the Muslims want their own separate prayer rooms, there is a move initiated to, oh, okay, we'll do that.
[00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:08.828]  I mean, pretty soon airports will be, you know, just every religious group having their own church built onto it, their own gathering place will be bigger than the rest of the facility.
[00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:19.735]  You know, you don't think when you go over to Israel and, hey, take down those menorahs, put up Christmas trees, I'm a Christian.
[00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:23.437]  Or I'm a Druid.
[00:04:23.477 --> 00:04:24.197]  I'm a pagan.
[00:04:24.578 --> 00:04:25.718]  Give me my Christmas tree.
[00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:27.119]  They could call for it, too.
[00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.080]  It really is their symbol.
[00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.042]  And can you imagine the Israelis jumping?
[00:04:33.483 --> 00:04:33.943]  Yes, sir!
[00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:34.543]  Yes, sir!
[00:04:35.264 --> 00:04:35.824]  We'll get up.
[00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:40.727]  How about hundreds of... It just shows how they get us all fighting with each other.
[00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:49.673]  Meanwhile, the big private banks are sucking out the insides of the country and our future.
[00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:51.497]  Big news on the other side.
[00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:52.019]  Stay with me.
[00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:07.466]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.767]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:17.791]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:25.514]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:28.856]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:31.557]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:32.798]  NSA spying.
[00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:37.319]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.160]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.281]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:47.782]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.841]  Good morning, honey.
[00:06:03.202 --> 00:06:09.208]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:06:09.488 --> 00:06:10.089]  Yeah.
[00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:11.891]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:15.655]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:17.617]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:06:18.057 --> 00:06:19.759]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.922]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:06:22.142 --> 00:06:22.983]  Honey, cheer up.
[00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.645]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[00:06:25.905 --> 00:06:26.225]  What?
[00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:37.134]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[00:06:37.434 --> 00:06:42.258]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:43.780]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:49.367]  Travel Berkey, not available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:07.669]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.853]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:15.836]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:16.336 --> 00:07:19.759]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:24.842]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.303 --> 00:07:28.485]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:31.928]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:32.688 --> 00:07:34.829]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:36.750]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.910]  U.S.
[00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.071]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:39.371]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:40.272]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:41.092]  Ask for George.
[00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:08.439]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:12.081]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.446 --> 00:08:28.972]  Coming up later in this hour, I'm going to play a six-minute report from PBS Laird NewsHour a couple nights ago, where...
[00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:35.083]  They admit that the firemen and police lungs are filled with concrete and asbestos.
[00:08:36.305 --> 00:08:44.197]  And then they've got some city and federally funded scientists going, well, it's clear they're sick, but we don't know why.
[00:08:45.074 --> 00:08:49.397]  And then it shows Mount Sinai scientists and doctors going, no, we know exactly.
[00:08:49.857 --> 00:08:51.638]  Here are biopsies of lung tissue.
[00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:53.900]  It's filled with asbestos.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.881]  Here are the asbestos fibers.
[00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:59.663]  And they have asbestos.
[00:08:59.824 --> 00:09:01.665]  I'm suddenly having trouble pronouncing it.
[00:09:02.405 --> 00:09:03.726]  You get nervous on air, folks.
[00:09:03.806 --> 00:09:07.949]  I can pronounce and say asbestos anytime I want off air.
[00:09:07.969 --> 00:09:10.490]  And then I have trouble once I get on air.
[00:09:11.531 --> 00:09:14.513]  Asbestos, I believe is how they pronounce it.
[00:09:15.323 --> 00:09:19.944]  And just, you're not going to get treatment and it's not going to be paid for.
[00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:22.005]  You know what I mean?
[00:09:22.105 --> 00:09:23.505]  That's the government's attitude.
[00:09:23.845 --> 00:09:24.385]  Period.
[00:09:25.745 --> 00:09:37.408]  And I remember just a few months after 9-11, the EPA chief's report came out for about a day saying that we had serious inhalation problems there at Ground Zero.
[00:09:38.886 --> 00:09:53.893]  And then suddenly, Christina Todd Whitman came out and said, we were wrong, we've had federal air quality testing systems there within hours of the attack, and it shows that the air is not polluted, that particulates are at normal levels.
[00:09:54.914 --> 00:10:04.959]  Now, the police, the firemen, the general public, was a little more trusting five, six years ago, and they literally said, well, they say it's safe, it must be.
[00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:06.295]  We're good to go.
[00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:06.475]  I think?
[00:10:33.522 --> 00:10:38.685]  And has the basic consistency and the same chemical effect as Drano.
[00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:48.049]  We've used that analogy several times with different firemen and emergency workers we've had on the show because that's what Mount Sinai told them.
[00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:49.570]  They said it's like Drano.
[00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.872]  Well, you're going to hear that same quote coming up.
[00:10:54.702 --> 00:11:04.737]  And so now the government's still dancing around it saying, we don't know, we don't know, and thousands and thousands and thousands of the rescue workers are deathly ill.
[00:11:05.513 --> 00:11:08.594]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds have already died.
[00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:13.016]  Every day it's in a New York paper where a couple people died.
[00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:17.578]  Nuns who were helping, National Guard who were helping, police who were helping.
[00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:34.626]  And instead of giving the family some type of pension, like normally when a cop gets killed or a fireman gets burned to death, instead of saying, here's half a million dollars, which is a paltry sum with today's inflation, over the widow and the children's lives.
[00:11:35.413 --> 00:11:38.515]  No, they just said, you get nothing!
[00:11:40.276 --> 00:11:43.857]  And most of the police said, hey, we're ready to lick your boots.
[00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:44.378]  Thank you.
[00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:45.838]  We're ready to run checkpoints.
[00:11:45.858 --> 00:11:47.359]  We're ready to scream at demonstrators.
[00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:50.241]  We're ready to violate the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment.
[00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:53.322]  We want to serve the government that abuses us.
[00:11:53.502 --> 00:11:54.623]  We love it.
[00:11:55.563 --> 00:11:57.244]  Thank you for all you do.
[00:11:57.324 --> 00:11:58.765]  I mean, that's sick.
[00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:06.091]  But it's just like an Aztec who would give their child willingly to the high priest to have its heart cut out and thank the high priest for doing it.
[00:12:06.712 --> 00:12:16.160]  It's just like Romans thinking it was normal to throw women and children into the arena by the time they really got decadent to be torn apart by lions, by bears.
[00:12:16.781 --> 00:12:17.862]  They think it's cute.
[00:12:18.903 --> 00:12:20.644]  They think it's fun.
[00:12:20.905 --> 00:12:23.247]  It's funny what's happened to the country.
[00:12:24.273 --> 00:12:26.515]  And I get the threatening emails.
[00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:28.137]  I've gotten the phone calls here on air.
[00:12:28.157 --> 00:12:28.637]  You've heard them.
[00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:30.699]  Saying that I'm a traitor.
[00:12:30.859 --> 00:12:31.740]  I'm lying.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.363]  Depleted uranium isn't bad for the troops.
[00:12:34.683 --> 00:12:37.446]  Doesn't matter if we have the Army and Pentagon training manuals.
[00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:39.788]  Doesn't matter if we have mining college documents.
[00:12:40.028 --> 00:12:44.412]  Doesn't matter if we have documents going back to the 50s and the 70s and the 80s and the 90s.
[00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:47.195]  And the head of the Pentagon's DU program on.
[00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:49.097]  Most of his team has died.
[00:12:50.194 --> 00:12:51.315]  From handling this stuff.
[00:12:51.635 --> 00:12:52.395]  Doesn't matter.
[00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:54.536]  They're going to continue to use it.
[00:12:55.257 --> 00:13:03.421]  And I can go out to Crawford where the neocon followers are out there protesting against the anti-Bush people, you know, 365 days a year.
[00:13:03.441 --> 00:13:06.723]  And I've got them on tape saying, I'm a liar.
[00:13:07.043 --> 00:13:08.324]  DU isn't bad for you.
[00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:11.836]  And we've got local newscasts saying Mercury's good for you.
[00:13:12.316 --> 00:13:13.997]  I mean, they'll tell you DU's good.
[00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:15.658]  They'll tell you asbestos is good.
[00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.719]  They'll tell you Mercury's good.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.081]  They'll tell you cameras in school bathrooms are good.
[00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:24.963]  They'll tell you thumb scanning going in nationwide to get driver's licenses is good.
[00:13:25.244 --> 00:13:29.406]  They'll tell you illegal aliens not having to show any type of ID is good.
[00:13:29.426 --> 00:13:32.688]  I mean, it's just pandemonium.
[00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:35.509]  In-your-face corruption.
[00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.011]  So we've got that clip coming up.
[00:13:39.548 --> 00:14:03.134]  And really, I don't have a lot of respect for some of the New York police and firefighters and others who will go on national TV and defend the government and say that the government didn't know that the asbestos was bad for them and that George Bush didn't do anything wrong.
[00:14:03.554 --> 00:14:08.355]  Remember a few weeks ago, Kevin Smith was on Mancow National Fox News television?
[00:14:09.694 --> 00:14:10.255]  We're good to go.
[00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:44.835]  And there's a lot of papers in New York, had it on the cover, and you'd buy the paper, and it would be two or three, four stories in each article every day I was there.
[00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:56.821]  And this guy's a New York firefighter, and he goes on TV and says that we're wrong because we are saying the government knew it was killing them and didn't give them any help.
[00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:00.983]  Defending those that are killing them!
[00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:10.018]  No, frankly, frankly, I'd like to slap them upside the head and ask them what their problem is.
[00:15:12.701 --> 00:15:19.829]  That's like a woman who's got a boyfriend that beats her and knocks her teeth out and rapes her and puts cigarettes out on her and she's sitting there defending them.
[00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.334]  I don't have any respect for people like that!
[00:15:25.552 --> 00:15:34.796]  You have got a major problem, and your denial, your weak-mindedness, is going to destroy this country.
[00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:43.401]  Now, I remember being at Ground Zero two years ago, two years and some change, for the Republican National Convention.
[00:15:44.201 --> 00:15:50.024]  And at that time, I'd say about 60% of the firefighters, they were all there in their, you know, dress blues, running around.
[00:15:50.344 --> 00:15:51.124]  We're in agreement.
[00:15:51.184 --> 00:15:52.245]  We're telling this good job.
[00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:53.565]  They know it's an inside job.
[00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:54.786]  They know there's a cover-up.
[00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.151]  Half the police were friendly.
[00:15:57.191 --> 00:16:01.133]  The other half would scream at us and threaten to arrest us anywhere.
[00:16:01.353 --> 00:16:03.174]  Central Park interviewing people.
[00:16:03.494 --> 00:16:04.474]  Walking down the street.
[00:16:04.694 --> 00:16:05.895]  They think it's Nazi Germany.
[00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:13.917]  Well, I was there two years later on 9-11, and I'd say 65-70% of the police were saying thank you.
[00:16:13.937 --> 00:16:15.118]  We know it's an inside job.
[00:16:15.338 --> 00:16:16.558]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:19.059]  When you've got police captains going, hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:19.519]  Keep it up.
[00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:21.200]  And they go, do you know about Northwoods?
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.880]  Yeah, we know.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.460]  Keep it up.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.701]  I mean, in their dress uniforms with the cameras on them.
[00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:26.881]  We've got all this on tape.
[00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:31.903]  We've got like 75-80 hours of stuff in New York.
[00:16:32.723 --> 00:16:34.524]  Don't have even the staff to go through it all.
[00:16:36.866 --> 00:16:40.829]  So this is the type of things that we're witnessing.
[00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.112]  I'd say 65-70% of the cops totally on our side.
[00:16:44.172 --> 00:16:46.294]  Most of the others neutral.
[00:16:46.314 --> 00:16:49.877]  5% still threatening to arrest us, cussing at us, sticking their feet out to trip us.
[00:16:50.117 --> 00:16:54.241]  Just mindless, gibbering thugs who love being abused.
[00:16:54.761 --> 00:16:57.544]  And 99% of the firefighters were on our side.
[00:16:58.124 --> 00:16:59.664]  We could hardly do interviews.
[00:17:00.024 --> 00:17:01.585]  We could hardly get down the street.
[00:17:01.805 --> 00:17:03.685]  We could hardly eat dinner in restaurants.
[00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:05.465]  We couldn't buy our food.
[00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:09.286]  The firemen wouldn't leave us alone.
[00:17:09.306 --> 00:17:10.426]  We're trying to do our job.
[00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.047]  Coming up, shaking our hands, telling us, thank you.
[00:17:13.387 --> 00:17:14.227]  They know the truth.
[00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.387]  They've seen Terror Storm.
[00:17:15.427 --> 00:17:16.407]  They've seen Loose Change.
[00:17:16.687 --> 00:17:17.868]  They've seen Martial Law.
[00:17:18.788 --> 00:17:21.128]  All their buddies are dying and fighting for their lives.
[00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:22.168]  They're sick.
[00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:23.829]  They know they were lied to.
[00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:26.049]  So, big change in two years.
[00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:27.550]  Big change.
[00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:28.811]  So I commend them.
[00:17:29.392 --> 00:17:30.173]  They're heroes.
[00:17:31.374 --> 00:17:32.415]  They have moral courage.
[00:17:32.455 --> 00:17:34.156]  They can admit the truth to themselves.
[00:17:34.977 --> 00:17:49.630]  But I'm telling you, the type of people like that firefighter that Kevin went up against, what was his name, Harvey, on Fox News, after it's been all over the newspapers, he lives in New York, he's sick from this stuff.
[00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.172]  They tell him he's dying from it.
[00:17:52.253 --> 00:17:52.593]  Okay?
[00:17:53.968 --> 00:17:55.509]  It's going to end up probably killing him.
[00:17:56.369 --> 00:17:57.570]  He can't work anymore.
[00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.251]  His buddies are dying and are sick, these men and women.
[00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:03.752]  And he's going, no, no, the government didn't know.
[00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.492]  The government didn't know.
[00:18:04.532 --> 00:18:05.973]  The government didn't.
[00:18:05.993 --> 00:18:08.574]  It's in the official newspapers.
[00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:19.178]  It's admitted that they knew a weekend and they wanted $96 million for emergency treatment immediately, which could have helped a lot of these people.
[00:18:19.478 --> 00:18:20.899]  And the Bush administration said no.
[00:18:22.106 --> 00:18:23.648]  No, we don't want the liability.
[00:18:24.288 --> 00:18:25.009]  But it gets worse.
[00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:28.012]  They knew day one.
[00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:31.535]  The firemen and police were saying, we need breathing apparatus.
[00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:36.339]  They were collapsing within hours of being in there breathing all of this particula.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.041]  Okay, just everywhere.
[00:18:38.061 --> 00:18:41.564]  Have you ever walked around a campfire and a little bit of smoke blows in your face?
[00:18:41.844 --> 00:18:47.249]  Well, imagine the real smoke filled with asbestos and mercury and lead and concrete.
[00:18:48.573 --> 00:18:50.214]  And they said, we need help.
[00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.415]  And they said, oh, the air is safe.
[00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:53.716]  You don't need anything.
[00:18:54.876 --> 00:18:58.979]  And then a few days later, here's some paper masks for you.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:16.708]  Meanwhile, FEMA and the FDA and the EPA and all the rest of these federal agencies that were out there, they were wearing full hazmat body gear, full rubber suits, basically space helmets.
[00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:19.759]  Like you see in the movie Outbreak.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.980]  With oxygen tanks.
[00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:26.301]  And well they should have been.
[00:19:26.842 --> 00:19:30.463]  Did they say fly in every one of those hazmat suits they had?
[00:19:30.643 --> 00:19:37.165]  Did they say get into the federal armories and fly them all in out of the military bases where they've got hundreds of thousands of these?
[00:19:37.525 --> 00:19:38.385]  No!
[00:19:39.065 --> 00:19:42.046]  It's safe for you.
[00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:44.347]  It's not bad.
[00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:54.709]  We're your government, the one that gave you atomic soldiers and radiated children and gave black men syphilis and covertly thousands of times tested bioweapons on the U.S.
[00:19:54.749 --> 00:19:55.449]  population.
[00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:57.109]  We love you.
[00:19:57.749 --> 00:19:58.670]  You're heroes.
[00:19:59.090 --> 00:19:59.950]  Go breathe it.
[00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:00.670]  It's good.
[00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:06.132]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:20:08.439 --> 00:20:13.262]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:16.204]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:20:16.244 --> 00:20:17.364]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:20:18.705 --> 00:20:23.308]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:20:24.228 --> 00:20:31.493]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:20:32.493 --> 00:20:35.535]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:20:37.688 --> 00:20:41.149]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:22:02.296 --> 00:22:05.237]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:10.519]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:15.361]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[00:22:15.921 --> 00:22:24.284]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?

[00:23:04.558 --> 00:23:06.499]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:06.999 --> 00:23:09.421]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:10.221 --> 00:23:18.586]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:23:39.942 --> 00:23:39.982]  702-953-0267.

[00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:54.845]  That's www.lazemedinc.com.
[00:24:17.964 --> 00:24:18.825]  Get that clip.
[00:24:19.165 --> 00:24:21.166]  I don't want to play the whole ten minute man cow piece.
[00:24:21.826 --> 00:24:24.488]  But can you find it for the next segment?
[00:24:24.528 --> 00:24:33.033]  Just the part where Kevin brings up what's happening to the police and firemen breathing the toxic stuff and how they haven't been given treatment.
[00:24:33.113 --> 00:24:37.075]  And then he denies it and goes, oh no, they didn't know.
[00:24:37.836 --> 00:24:39.717]  They didn't know when it's admitted.
[00:24:39.797 --> 00:24:40.958]  We have the memos.
[00:24:42.499 --> 00:24:46.481]  There's congressional talk of indicting Christina Todd Whitman.
[00:24:47.176 --> 00:24:50.497]  But still, no, the government wouldn't do bad to me.
[00:24:51.338 --> 00:24:54.499]  And then Kevin goes on to say, well, the founding fathers said don't trust the government.
[00:24:55.159 --> 00:24:56.920]  And both of them go, what?
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.681]  They never said that.
[00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:01.241]  You're just claiming that.
[00:25:01.301 --> 00:25:02.321]  They never said that.
[00:25:02.642 --> 00:25:04.522]  Oh, no, there's literally just hundreds of quotes.
[00:25:05.803 --> 00:25:07.523]  That's just what this whole country's founded on.
[00:25:10.164 --> 00:25:10.804]  They don't know.
[00:25:11.225 --> 00:25:14.806]  They think patriotism is just believing whatever lie you're told.
[00:25:15.538 --> 00:25:21.283]  Having absolutely no freedom and living in a police state where their children have no future either.
[00:25:22.484 --> 00:25:28.589]  The globalists want the police state so they can implode the economy and destroy the middle class and take your private property.
[00:25:30.174 --> 00:25:43.557]  They've got federal guidelines now nationwide through the states trying to make every gully, every little creek, every little depression have a barbed wire fence around it so the cows don't destroy the water quality.
[00:25:43.938 --> 00:25:57.201]  I heard Gary Brownfield talking about that this morning, and that's one of the things over the years I've researched, and I happen to follow the state and federal laws and regulations and guidelines because my family is in ranching.
[00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:00.564]  And it'll totally bankrupt everyone.
[00:26:00.584 --> 00:26:03.584]  There's no way to fence every little gully and every little thing.
[00:26:03.604 --> 00:26:14.047]  Of course, deer and buffalo and other species were... And they've done studies from the accounts back in the 1700s and 1800s.
[00:26:14.587 --> 00:26:17.408]  Actually, there was a greater...
[00:26:18.414 --> 00:26:24.658]  Population of grass-eating mammals in this country, and so an even higher level.
[00:26:25.159 --> 00:26:28.281]  I mean, it is true cows go get down in streams and do muddy them up.
[00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:29.862]  That's what animals do.
[00:26:30.682 --> 00:26:33.264]  Oh, no, it's killing the fish, killing the ecosystem.
[00:26:36.546 --> 00:26:46.994]  No, actually, the fish will come up in a creek where you've got cows, and they will sit there while the cow's feet stir up worms and other particulates and other...
[00:26:48.709 --> 00:26:52.451]  Other animals waste.
[00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:53.732]  Other fish waste.
[00:26:53.752 --> 00:26:54.612]  And that's what the fish eat.
[00:26:54.852 --> 00:26:57.194]  The fish actually come in and like the cows.
[00:26:57.454 --> 00:26:58.875]  They like the deer in the water.
[00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:00.876]  I'm already digressing.
[00:27:00.916 --> 00:27:07.740]  I wanted to get... It's just... Everything that's being done is about driving small businesses out of business.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.941]  It's about consolidating power.
[00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:12.082]  We're under attack.
[00:27:12.582 --> 00:27:13.523]  And the very people...
[00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:20.674]  That are attacking us, have orchestrated terror attacks, so they can then pose as our saviors, so we'll go along with what they're doing.
[00:27:24.714 --> 00:27:26.815]  Coming up in the next segment, I will play this clip.
[00:27:29.176 --> 00:27:35.097]  First, we'll play the clip of the firefighter going, oh no, the government didn't know, the government didn't know, no, no, no, they didn't know.
[00:27:36.257 --> 00:27:36.837]  They're good.
[00:27:36.857 --> 00:27:43.779]  And then we've got the clip from PBS, which you would think is a fair report, but it's really a whitewash.
[00:27:44.284 --> 00:27:49.266]  You know, they finally go to the scientist at major institutions going, no, we know what's doing it.
[00:27:49.586 --> 00:27:51.247]  Look, here's their lung tissue.
[00:27:51.327 --> 00:27:52.788]  It's full of asbestos.
[00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:57.750]  I mean, they know.
[00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.291]  You breathe a bunch of asbestos, it will kill you.
[00:28:01.632 --> 00:28:06.114]  Those buildings had tens of thousands of tons apiece of asbestos.
[00:28:09.423 --> 00:28:11.905]  That's another ridiculous thing we always hear.
[00:28:12.466 --> 00:28:14.848]  Oh, the steel columns melted because of the jet fuel.
[00:28:15.249 --> 00:28:18.071]  They were jacketed with asbestos.
[00:28:19.453 --> 00:28:27.120]  Incredible fire retardant that they put on the outside of huge engines and ships and in trains.
[00:28:29.382 --> 00:28:31.645]  Incredible insulation.
[00:28:31.665 --> 00:28:32.946]  That's why they used it.
[00:28:34.542 --> 00:28:39.731]  And then, of course, you can't talk about the evidence of how they brought down the buildings with bombs without going through the evidence.
[00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:41.173]  I can't do it a disservice.
[00:28:41.714 --> 00:28:44.439]  Remember the holes in the buildings with the people looking out?
[00:28:45.385 --> 00:28:45.845]  We're good to go.
[00:29:13.863 --> 00:29:20.868]  But then right next to tiny fires, gouts of molten steel pouring out like it was a foundry.
[00:29:21.208 --> 00:29:25.612]  And we have the firefighters saying it was like molten steel like a volcano.
[00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:28.914]  Right next to people waving shirts.
[00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:31.236]  See, that's localized heat sources.
[00:29:33.978 --> 00:29:36.059]  Only localized heat sources can do that.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.062]  Oh no, the planes did it.
[00:29:40.502 --> 00:29:42.804]  And then pulverized the buildings into dust.
[00:29:43.892 --> 00:29:45.094]  Sure they did.
[00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:49.241]  Sure they did.
[00:29:51.664 --> 00:29:52.586]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.087 --> 00:29:54.689]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.295]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:01.951]  We're good to go.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:19.861]  We're good to go.
[00:30:35.742 --> 00:30:36.182]  We're good to go.
[00:30:36.202 --> 00:30:36.623]  We're good to go.
[00:30:36.643 --> 00:30:37.023]  We're good to go.
[00:31:01.158 --> 00:31:09.404]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.664 --> 00:31:14.027]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.307 --> 00:31:23.233]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.433 --> 00:31:27.056]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.296 --> 00:31:27.997]  We're good to go.
[00:31:28.077 --> 00:31:28.358]  I think?
[00:31:41.095 --> 00:31:41.815]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:41.835 --> 00:31:43.116]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.411 --> 00:32:03.052]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[00:32:03.132 --> 00:32:03.933]  What's wrong?
[00:32:03.953 --> 00:32:05.234]  I am so tired.
[00:32:05.294 --> 00:32:07.775]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:32:07.915 --> 00:32:08.996]  I have tried everything.
[00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:10.817]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:32:10.957 --> 00:32:12.098]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:32:12.238 --> 00:32:14.540]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.261]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:18.543]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[00:32:18.663 --> 00:32:20.884]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:32:21.064 --> 00:32:21.585]  The what?
[00:32:21.845 --> 00:32:23.926]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.

[00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:32.812]  How well are you sleeping?

[00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:39.397]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:32:39.637 --> 00:32:42.939]  The Bedfan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[00:32:49.023 --> 00:32:52.265]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[00:32:52.506 --> 00:32:53.806]  The Bedfan is the answer.
[00:32:54.027 --> 00:32:55.428]  Visit Bedfan.com.
[00:32:55.688 --> 00:32:58.069]  That's Bedfan.com.
[00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:04.281]  Federal agents!
[00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:05.322]  We are armed!
[00:33:05.582 --> 00:33:09.024]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[00:33:09.204 --> 00:33:11.566]  Would you stand up for truth?
[00:33:11.686 --> 00:33:14.628]  Or would you turn away too?
[00:33:14.928 --> 00:33:19.951]  And then what if you saw all of the things that's right?
[00:33:20.012 --> 00:33:22.013]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:23.166]  We're good.
[00:33:43.902 --> 00:33:48.024]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[00:33:48.284 --> 00:33:50.865]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[00:33:51.165 --> 00:33:53.226]  They wanted me about a summer or whatever.
[00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:55.127]  Picture me buying the scam.
[00:33:55.187 --> 00:33:55.887]  I said never.
[00:33:56.387 --> 00:33:58.808]  You ain't tuned to a hard truth, so just spit it.
[00:33:59.049 --> 00:34:01.490]  I stay committed, give up, survive, lose commission.
[00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.211]  It's all a part of fighting devil's state mind control.
[00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:06.672]  And all about the battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[00:34:06.752 --> 00:34:09.433]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shake you.
[00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:11.874]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and rapists.
[00:34:12.074 --> 00:34:12.594]  We're good to go.
[00:34:12.614 --> 00:34:13.214]  We're good to go.
[00:34:43.773 --> 00:34:46.230]  We're good to go.
[00:34:48.567 --> 00:34:51.029]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[00:34:51.229 --> 00:34:53.631]  On 9-11 morning, couldn't stand his name.
[00:34:53.731 --> 00:34:56.553]  Now even he's waving flags like they lost their mind.
[00:34:56.613 --> 00:34:58.875]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[00:34:59.155 --> 00:35:01.477]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[00:35:01.497 --> 00:35:03.919]  The oldest trick in the book is make an enemy.
[00:35:04.259 --> 00:35:06.521]  A phony evil so the government can do its dirt.
[00:35:06.881 --> 00:35:09.243]  And take away your freedom, lock and load, beat and search.
[00:35:09.323 --> 00:35:11.925]  Ain't nothing changed but more colored people locked in prison.
[00:35:11.945 --> 00:35:14.567]  These pigs still beat us, but it seems we forgetting.
[00:35:14.687 --> 00:35:17.049]  But I remember 4 September, how these devils do it.
[00:35:17.669 --> 00:35:19.790]  Tuliani, ask Diallo how he doing.
[00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.870]  We in the streets, holler jail to the feet.
[00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.651]  Follow, waving flags, bring these dragons to they knees.
[00:35:24.991 --> 00:35:27.171]  Oil, blood, money, make these killers ride cold.
[00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.932]  Suspicious suicide, people dying, never told.
[00:35:30.332 --> 00:35:32.872]  It's all a part of playing cards, so you think we need them.
[00:35:32.912 --> 00:35:35.633]  While being Ashcroft, take away your rights to freedom.
[00:35:35.673 --> 00:35:37.973]  Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators.
[00:35:38.253 --> 00:35:40.614]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cause it's nature.
[00:35:40.894 --> 00:35:43.355]  Why don't you tell us what you do?
[00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:45.255]  There's a lot of things we know.
[00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.192]  So now you askin' why my records always come the same?
[00:36:04.413 --> 00:36:06.875]  Keep it real, ain't no fillers blingin'.
[00:36:06.915 --> 00:36:09.197]  Mine eyes seen the gory of the comin' of the beast.
[00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:11.699]  So every story, every word I'm sayin' peace.
[00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:14.502]  See you can witness the Illuminati body count.
[00:36:14.662 --> 00:36:17.184]  Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout.
[00:36:17.224 --> 00:36:19.846]  You think a couple thousand lies mean the killers?
[00:36:19.906 --> 00:36:22.349]  Nigga, I swear to God, we the ones, ain't no villains.
[00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:24.951]  Or any other word they think to demonize the country.
[00:36:25.211 --> 00:36:25.692]  We're good to go.
[00:36:41.227 --> 00:36:41.607]  All right.
[00:36:41.627 --> 00:36:43.348]  I tell you, that is such an amazing song.
[00:37:12.085 --> 00:37:13.426]  Just never gets old, does it?
[00:37:13.726 --> 00:37:16.309]  Paris says it all right there.
[00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.430]  All right.
[00:37:19.491 --> 00:37:26.617]  I mean, I really do get angry, because they knew day one that the dust was deadly, and they just didn't care.
[00:37:26.637 --> 00:37:37.607]  I remember asking my dad as a child when we were watching a show about atomic soldiers on PBS, and I said, Daddy, why'd they have the soldiers walk through after they dropped the bomb?
[00:37:38.533 --> 00:37:44.116]  Because it was showing the documents about how the government knew it was going to make them sick, but they wanted to get the full effects and used them as guinea pigs.
[00:37:44.617 --> 00:37:46.478]  I said, why didn't they just put monkeys out there?
[00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:51.561]  And he said, son, GIs are a lot cheaper than monkeys.
[00:37:54.983 --> 00:37:57.265]  And he knew what he was talking about.
[00:37:58.325 --> 00:38:05.790]  My dad had worked in college and even in high school at MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility and said he saw quite a bit.
[00:38:08.337 --> 00:38:09.117]  Yep, that's true.
[00:38:09.557 --> 00:38:12.358]  People are a lot cheaper than monkeys, and monkeys are expensive.
[00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:16.099]  There's not six and a half billion monkeys or apes.
[00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:18.379]  Well, a lot of them are endangered.
[00:38:18.399 --> 00:38:20.079]  No, no, no, no, those are expensive to ship in.
[00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:21.480]  You've got animal rights people defending them.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.541]  No, no, no, you test it on the soldiers, and they love you for it.
[00:38:27.801 --> 00:38:33.082]  It's a big, sick joke with the New World Order that they abuse their own servants.
[00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:38.835]  They abuse their own attack dogs and their own attack dogs and look at us trying to warn them.
[00:38:40.215 --> 00:38:42.337]  Those of us that are standing strong and tall.
[00:38:43.257 --> 00:38:45.338]  And you look at us and say, we're the bad man.
[00:38:45.919 --> 00:38:48.680]  No, you work for the evil people.
[00:38:50.281 --> 00:38:54.183]  And you need to come to grips with that and the corruption.
[00:38:55.544 --> 00:39:00.586]  There are no police I know who will deny that the government ships in much of the narcotics.
[00:39:00.747 --> 00:39:01.547]  Everybody knows that.
[00:39:02.199 --> 00:39:05.021]  Well, just take it from that logical extension into everything else.
[00:39:06.242 --> 00:39:08.004]  This system is a joke!
[00:39:10.346 --> 00:39:11.187]  Take the toll roads.
[00:39:12.027 --> 00:39:22.536]  The official TxDOT plans that came out two years ago show 14 major roads in Austin, this is just a microcosm of the country, that are going to have toll roads.
[00:39:23.617 --> 00:39:24.558]  Existing roads.
[00:39:25.499 --> 00:39:26.340]  Ben White, 183, Mopac...
[00:39:29.077 --> 00:39:32.240]  I-35, William Cannon, it goes on and on.
[00:39:34.602 --> 00:39:36.563]  We have the official text documents.
[00:39:37.304 --> 00:39:38.525]  Texas Department of Transportation.
[00:39:40.126 --> 00:39:43.869]  We go to huge public meetings with thousands of people screaming, saying they don't want it.
[00:39:43.889 --> 00:39:44.750]  They say, who's for it?
[00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.311]  Six people raise their hands.
[00:39:47.332 --> 00:39:51.876]  1,400 at one meeting say no and start stomping so hard the building starts shaking and they ask them to quit.
[00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:53.097]  We've got this on tape.
[00:39:55.706 --> 00:39:59.608]  And they get up in line and say, there's no plans to put toll roads on any of these roads.
[00:40:00.869 --> 00:40:05.331]  And then now they announce in Sunday's paper that they indeed are going to slap a toll road on Ben White.
[00:40:08.712 --> 00:40:09.673]  They're not going to stop.
[00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:11.774]  They don't care.
[00:40:14.095 --> 00:40:16.356]  Then the tax documents come out a year and a half ago.
[00:40:19.491 --> 00:40:36.379]  That they have more than enough money, that TxDOT has huge $6-plus billion surpluses, that the roads are all paid for, that they're bathing in money, more fuels being used than ever on that gas tax, not to mention the sticker taxes and the tags and everything else.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:42.342]  Their own internal document is going, why are we handing over our roads to foreign countries?
[00:40:43.943 --> 00:40:45.984]  Because we're going into receivership.
[00:40:48.078 --> 00:40:48.558]  Period.
[00:40:48.598 --> 00:40:50.399]  You know what receivership is?
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.482]  And it isn't like when you lose your house because you didn't pay the mortgage where you supposedly owe the money.
[00:40:57.302 --> 00:41:00.703]  That's all zeros and ones created on a ballot sheet to begin with itself in a fraud.
[00:41:01.424 --> 00:41:02.664]  But at least there's some connection.
[00:41:02.704 --> 00:41:03.565]  You've signed a contract.
[00:41:04.045 --> 00:41:13.129]  Here, they set up the banking system in 1913 to destroy the economy and basically transfer the wealth.
[00:41:13.189 --> 00:41:16.510]  And now they've done it, and now the economy is shifting into the police state.
[00:41:17.777 --> 00:41:23.200]  I also want to play a clip from Splinter Cell, the new TV show, where they make fun of 9-11 truthers.
[00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:26.903]  It's the terrorists sitting and laughing and kissing each other.
[00:41:26.923 --> 00:41:29.344]  Going, oh baby, they're so stupid.
[00:41:29.364 --> 00:41:32.326]  They don't know we're carrying out the attacks.
[00:41:32.366 --> 00:41:33.547]  They think the government's doing it.
[00:41:34.727 --> 00:41:37.989]  And weak-minded people sit there and watch that.
[00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.731]  And think that's reality.
[00:41:40.951 --> 00:41:42.652]  That's called propaganda.
[00:41:42.872 --> 00:41:45.394]  That's called devil state mind control!
[00:41:46.502 --> 00:41:48.063]  That's how these devils do it!
[00:41:51.346 --> 00:41:52.106]  I'm sick of it!
[00:41:53.647 --> 00:41:54.528]  I'm tired of it!
[00:42:02.614 --> 00:42:10.300]  Now here's PBS admitting Larry Neusauer
[00:42:11.488 --> 00:42:16.572]  That they're sick, but oh, since we can't isolate it, we're not going to pay for their treatment or really help them.
[00:42:17.233 --> 00:42:21.797]  They're not helping them.
[00:42:21.817 --> 00:42:25.400]  But then later in the report, they go to Mount Sinai and other institutions.
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.301]  They go, no, we know.
[00:42:26.341 --> 00:42:27.122]  Here's their lungs.
[00:42:27.422 --> 00:42:28.523]  It's called a particula.
[00:42:29.163 --> 00:42:29.544]  Here it is.
[00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:34.973]  Now, dust and debris at the World Trade Center site after 9-11.
[00:42:34.993 --> 00:42:38.094]  Did it cause disease in rescue workers?
[00:42:38.574 --> 00:42:42.336]  NewsHour correspondent Tom Bearden has our science unit report.
[00:42:43.196 --> 00:42:54.121]  Clouds of toxic dust rolled down New York City streets like tidal waves on September 11, 2001, engulfing tens of thousands of people fleeing the collapse of the World Trade Center.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.343]  In the months that followed, thousands more labored on what they called the pile.
[00:42:59.824 --> 00:43:03.647]  First trying to rescue people, and later recovering human remains.
[00:43:04.327 --> 00:43:06.889]  And all the while, they inhaled the dust.
[00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:12.374]  Philip Landrigan is the Chairman of Preventive Medicine at Manhattan's Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
[00:43:12.914 --> 00:43:20.160]  The major component of the World Trade Center dust was pulverized concrete, cement, which was very, very alkaline.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.562]  It had a pH of 10 or 11.
[00:43:22.682 --> 00:43:28.163]  Which means that the alkalinity of this material is equivalent to that of Drano.
[00:43:28.783 --> 00:43:33.364]  The dust also contained billions of microscopic shards of glass and other contaminants.
[00:43:33.904 --> 00:43:37.225]  The question is, what did the dust do to those who inhaled it?
[00:43:37.845 --> 00:43:43.947]  You trudged through, you know, this debris and smoke, and half of the street was sunny, the other half was a dark cloud.
[00:43:44.447 --> 00:43:45.847]  You know, debris up to my thighs.
[00:43:46.767 --> 00:43:52.551]  NYPD detectives John Walcott and his partner Richard Volpe spent hundreds of hours at the Trade Center.
[00:43:52.972 --> 00:43:54.613]  Basically, I didn't have a shovel or anything.
[00:43:54.653 --> 00:44:00.297]  I just started digging with my hands and going through the rubble and picking up, you know, twisted metal and stuff like that.
[00:44:00.317 --> 00:44:02.038]  Just trying to find somebody.
[00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:05.481]  They believe the experience is slowly killing them.
[00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:12.966]  I ended up with AML leukemia, which is mainly caused by exposure to benzene, which we all know is an airline fuel.
[00:44:14.102 --> 00:44:14.462]  How about you?
[00:44:15.322 --> 00:44:20.963]  I was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy, which is basically the filters in my kidneys.
[00:44:21.023 --> 00:44:23.044]  They don't filter out the toxins in my body.
[00:44:24.164 --> 00:44:27.925]  Right now, I'm sitting here with less than 40% function in both my kidneys.
[00:44:28.905 --> 00:44:37.166]  Attorney David Warby has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Volpe and Walcott and nearly 9,000 more Ground Zero rescue workers.
[00:44:37.726 --> 00:44:41.387]  In the courtroom, he will have to prove it's the dust that caused their illnesses.
[00:44:42.129 --> 00:44:44.070]  I have eighty clients who have died.
[00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:51.392]  Some from heart attacks from pulmonary collapse, some from leukemia, some from cancers that are carcinogenically related.
[00:44:52.053 --> 00:44:55.294]  The lawsuit was filed against the city of New York and its contractors.
[00:44:55.714 --> 00:44:58.635]  City officials did not return calls for interview requests.
[00:45:00.296 --> 00:45:04.717]  Warby knows that proving all these injuries were caused by the dust will be a formidable task.
[00:45:05.397 --> 00:45:09.919]  In court you have to prove with a reasonable degree of medical certainty based upon
[00:45:10.725 --> 00:45:23.654]  We've recognized epidemiological and toxicological studies, expert opinions, peer-reviewed rated medical studies with 95% scientific certainty upon which your experts base their decisions.
[00:45:24.315 --> 00:45:29.278]  So if you're dealing with a situation that no one's seen before, it's awfully tough to come up with those studies.
[00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.339]  Take a big breath in again.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:36.103]  And scientific studies, particularly those relating to human health, take decades.
[00:45:36.687 --> 00:45:38.248]  There have been similar cases before.
[00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:39.949]  Agent Orange in Vietnam.
[00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.551]  Industrial Chemicals at Love Canal, New York.
[00:45:42.992 --> 00:45:44.733]  Dioxin at Times Beach, Missouri.
[00:45:45.173 --> 00:45:49.236]  The issue of certainty is one that we often dance around.
[00:45:49.737 --> 00:45:51.698]  That's the objective of science.
[00:45:51.778 --> 00:45:53.219]  It's the search for the truth.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:59.364]  Joseph Graziano is Associate Dean for Research at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.
[00:45:59.904 --> 00:46:05.008]  He says it's extraordinarily hard to scientifically establish specific causes and effects.
[00:46:05.746 --> 00:46:24.691]  Each of us has a different lifestyle, a different diet, a different family history, and so we end up studying sets of people who are a mix of people, and not everyone will respond to a given dose or a given dose of a mixture of chemicals in the same fashion.
[00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:30.512]  He says what's needed most to make a causal connection between dust and disease is time.
[00:46:31.132 --> 00:46:33.093]  It's like developing a piece of film.
[00:46:34.465 --> 00:46:39.429]  In the dark room, you look at the film early on and you see a faint image of what the picture is.
[00:46:39.929 --> 00:46:41.830]  Look at cigarette smoking.
[00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:46.113]  It takes 20 years before cancers develop, for example.
[00:46:46.953 --> 00:46:48.574]  And asbestos exposure.
[00:46:48.594 --> 00:46:53.057]  It takes many years before the mesotheliomas develop.
[00:46:53.498 --> 00:46:57.961]  But Detective Volpe says the one thing many Trade Center workers don't have is time.
[00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:00.422]  People are dying every day.
[00:47:01.403 --> 00:47:01.523]  And...
[00:47:02.395 --> 00:47:03.875]  Time is everything right now.
[00:47:03.915 --> 00:47:08.896]  I mean, they want to sit here and they want to do all these different tests and they want to do all this research.
[00:47:09.736 --> 00:47:12.837]  You know, we might not have that time for the research.
[00:47:13.657 --> 00:47:19.038]  Some scientists believe they have already proven a connection between Trade Center dust and respiratory problems.
[00:47:19.658 --> 00:47:30.360]  Dr. William Rahm, who is director of chest services at Bellevue Hospital, showed us microscopic images of material found in the lungs of a firefighter who came into his hospital in respiratory failure.
[00:47:31.044 --> 00:47:33.344]  This is a World Trade Center dust particle.
[00:47:33.364 --> 00:47:39.866]  You can see that it's been burned, and it has a very rounded shape, but it's got some odd pieces to it.
[00:47:40.066 --> 00:47:42.766]  Relatively speaking, how big is that?
[00:47:44.206 --> 00:47:50.708]  A red blood cell is 7 microns, so this is below the size of a red blood cell.
[00:47:51.248 --> 00:47:58.369]  So that means that this can be inhaled into the nose and into the trachea and way out to the periphery of the lung to the air sacs.
[00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:03.706]  Ram also found a burned piece of fiberglass and this asbestos fiber.
[00:48:04.807 --> 00:48:07.669]  And this is very long and very narrow.
[00:48:07.949 --> 00:48:17.354]  So this kind of fiber can get into the lung by coming lengthwise with the end or radius leading the way.
[00:48:17.954 --> 00:48:21.476]  Dr. Ram says an awful lot of people inhaled these materials.
[00:48:22.475 --> 00:48:37.526]  Over 11,000 firefighters responded to the initial collapse and were exposed to the most intense dust clouds over those days and over 1,800 of these firefighters have been retired on a respiratory disability.
[00:48:39.267 --> 00:48:42.310]  Are you satisfied that's a direct result of working in that area?
[00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:49.675]  We are convinced that this is a direct result from the dust exposure to the World Trade Center dust.
[00:48:50.572 --> 00:48:57.997]  And in September, Mount Sinai released a significant study that monitored roughly 9,200 recovery workers, showing similar connections.
[00:48:58.977 --> 00:49:10.484]  The major finding that we reported was that approximately 60% of these people had developed new respiratory symptoms since starting work at Ground Zero.
[00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:17.829]  While scientists seem to agree there's a causal connection between the dust and respiratory illnesses,
[00:49:18.502 --> 00:49:24.490]  Attorney Warby says thousands of people have also contracted many other diseases, like cancer and kidney disease.
[00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:30.557]  So you've got a list of carcinogens, you've got a list of toxins, you've got a list of diseases that my people have.
[00:49:30.917 --> 00:49:34.422]  You have the 50,000 people who weren't there, the 50,000 people who weren't there.
[00:49:34.702 --> 00:49:36.805]  You stack them all up, and the...
[00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:51.482]  Catastrophic response, scientifically, is that, oh my God, thousands and thousands and thousands of people are going to be significantly ill, and more people will die post-9-11 from these illnesses than died on 9-11.
[00:49:51.702 --> 00:49:57.828]  Dr. Landrigan says it'll take a long-term commitment to study and treat all of the victims of the World Trade Center.
[00:49:57.848 --> 00:49:58.588]  Okay, so it goes on.
[00:49:58.648 --> 00:50:00.190]  See, they're putting it into a process.
[00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.753]  They're now admitting it, but then claiming it's a process and they didn't know.
[00:50:04.324 --> 00:50:11.586]  There's massive peer-reviewed case studies of asbestos alone, other particulate inhalation for minors.
[00:50:12.226 --> 00:50:13.186]  They know.
[00:50:13.346 --> 00:50:14.647]  They know immediately.
[00:50:14.667 --> 00:50:17.707]  It was out three years ago with the chest scans.
[00:50:18.588 --> 00:50:20.948]  Now it's just been codified into studies.
[00:50:21.168 --> 00:50:22.288]  They knew day one.
[00:50:22.308 --> 00:50:24.149]  The EPA knew day one.
[00:50:25.009 --> 00:50:28.130]  I mean, everybody knows about inhaling asbestos alone.
[00:50:29.574 --> 00:50:36.197]  Even if you're just cutting it into sections and removing it out of ships that are being broken, that is scrapped, or buildings.
[00:50:36.818 --> 00:50:37.278]  They knew!
[00:50:38.558 --> 00:50:41.040]  But now, oh no, it'll take more to study.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.321]  Their lungs are filled with asbestos.
[00:50:44.281 --> 00:50:46.282]  Their lungs are filled with toxic concrete.
[00:50:47.563 --> 00:50:51.265]  And they have to pay for their own treatment.
[00:50:52.805 --> 00:50:53.706]  This is your government.
[00:50:54.446 --> 00:50:55.307]  This is what they do.
[00:50:55.927 --> 00:50:57.007]  This is how they operate.
[00:50:57.408 --> 00:50:58.008]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.324 --> 00:51:07.486]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.827 --> 00:51:09.788]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.148 --> 00:51:17.813]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.474 --> 00:51:25.559]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.939 --> 00:51:28.881]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.221 --> 00:51:31.583]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.003 --> 00:51:32.844]  NSA spying.
[00:51:33.317 --> 00:51:37.338]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.658 --> 00:51:41.158]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.619 --> 00:51:43.519]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.879 --> 00:51:47.800]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:15.163 --> 00:54:15.803]  Welcome back.
[00:54:19.644 --> 00:54:42.749]  Shifting gears out of the particulate inhalation in lower Manhattan and surrounding areas, there is a new TV show called Sleeper Cell, American Terror, where the media, in conjunction with the government, and it's been admitted the Justice Department is involved in these programs,
[00:54:44.193 --> 00:54:45.833]  The Associated Press has reported on that.
[00:54:47.334 --> 00:54:51.215]  They create this illusion of terrorists everywhere they're about to get you.
[00:54:52.535 --> 00:54:53.876]  We're all in grave danger.
[00:54:53.896 --> 00:54:59.717]  If we don't just completely become total slaves of government, it's just all over.
[00:55:02.498 --> 00:55:06.939]  And this program starts with them torturing someone who they know is Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:08.132 --> 00:55:08.532]  We're good to go.
[00:55:08.552 --> 00:55:09.033]  We're good to go.
[00:55:38.398 --> 00:55:40.379]  I'm just here doing all this because I hate America.
[00:55:41.419 --> 00:55:47.361]  Of course, the government is getting rid of America with the North American Union and destroying our freedoms, but let's just ignore that.
[00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:51.802]  Let's ignore the facts that they're the ones destroying America, that they are Al-Ciata.
[00:55:53.443 --> 00:55:57.204]  Here is the sleeper cell clip right now.
[00:55:57.224 --> 00:56:00.225]  I gave them stingers, they gave me tea.
[00:56:02.165 --> 00:56:03.866]  No longer, and I'm not sure I've got the better deal.
[00:56:07.976 --> 00:56:11.178]  I would very much like a cup of tea.
[00:56:37.621 --> 00:56:39.763]  All right.
[00:56:39.803 --> 00:56:41.445]  Time to pick up where we left off.
[00:56:43.486 --> 00:56:45.808]  Who's the African-American member of your cell?
[00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:53.335]  And I swear to Allah, if you say Malcolm X, I'm going to kick your balls up into your throat and hold them there until you choke on them.
[00:56:55.697 --> 00:56:56.838]  What's a Malcolm X?
[00:56:58.139 --> 00:56:59.280]  Let's call him Tom.
[00:57:01.602 --> 00:57:02.243]  Oh, fuck!
[00:57:14.778 --> 00:57:16.698]  Nothing even close to the front page.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.441]  I'm happy to say I'm not a star anymore.
[00:57:23.702 --> 00:57:24.762]  You're a cooking star.
[00:57:28.264 --> 00:57:29.845]  You know, every time we have sex...
[00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:36.085]  It's like the ultimate **** you to Bush, Cheney, and the whole 9-11 plot.
[00:57:37.146 --> 00:57:46.996]  I just keep picturing Giuliani and the rest of those **** supervising the whole thing from that $15 million bunker on the 23rd floor of Building 7.
[00:57:47.036 --> 00:57:51.020]  You know that's where they broadcast the homing signal from?
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.162]  Make sure the planes don't hit the towers.
[00:57:54.981 --> 00:58:02.489]  I know, and the Pentagon was actually hit by a CIA global hawk, so the administration could start an endless war and turn America into a police state.
[00:58:02.889 --> 00:58:13.119]  And what idiot could believe that Osama bin Laden and his cave-dwelling Muslim militia managed to outsmart the CIA, the NSA, and the Pentagon?
[00:58:13.139 --> 00:58:16.382]  Unless Uncle Sam was behind the whole thing.
[00:58:17.323 --> 00:58:17.724]  Not me.
[00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:21.991]  And of course, that's the terrorist.
[00:58:22.111 --> 00:58:24.172]  Oh, and by the way, most terrorists are white.
[00:58:24.472 --> 00:58:26.993]  They're also getting you ready for that image, you see.
[00:58:27.013 --> 00:58:33.156]  There's all these secret Caucasian people that are part of Al-Qaeda now.
[00:58:34.016 --> 00:58:39.579]  You see, and if you talk about it, you talk about the government being involved, you're really Al-Qaeda.
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:45.942]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.577 --> 00:58:58.197]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.878 --> 00:58:59.938]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.638 --> 00:59:01.739]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.419 --> 00:59:03.220]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:04.861]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.881 --> 00:59:09.483]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.723 --> 00:59:13.845]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.367 --> 00:59:20.048]  I have been called a conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:23.190]  We're talking about the Gulf of Tonkin being staged.
[00:59:23.783 --> 00:59:27.144]  Despite the fact the government publicly has declassified that it was staged.
[00:59:27.925 --> 00:59:35.088]  I've been called a conspiracy theorist for reporting with CIA after action reports that our government staged terror attacks in Iran to blame it on their government.
[00:59:35.308 --> 00:59:37.169]  When the government admits it, people still deny it.
[00:59:37.689 --> 00:59:42.111]  Dick Cheney gets up on national television and says that he was secret about his CFR membership.
[00:59:43.031 --> 00:59:47.613]  We play the video of him saying it and people post in the message board that it isn't real.
[00:59:49.042 --> 00:59:56.486]  I had been at Ground Zero two years ago, I was there again this year, and I've had firemen and police tell me I'm a conspiracy terrorist, that the particulates were not bad for them.
[00:59:57.006 --> 01:00:00.248]  Now it's totally admitted the government knew it was going to kill them, and it is.
[01:00:01.529 --> 01:00:10.793]  And now they've got TV shows all over the country, this isn't the only one we just played in the last hour, where the terrorists sit around joking about how the American people think the government did it and how wonderful that is.
[01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:11.634]  Ha ha ha.
[01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:17.459]  This is the type of total propaganda immersion that we're under.
[01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:19.299]  And I, for one, am sick of it!
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.801]  For over a decade, I've been a conspiracy theorist because I read official North American Union document plans.
[01:00:27.161 --> 01:00:29.601]  Now it's all over national news, and it's admitted.
[01:00:32.542 --> 01:00:34.802]  All we're doing is reporting the facts here.
[01:00:35.003 --> 01:00:37.203]  The facts are easily attainable.
[01:00:39.437 --> 01:00:40.798]  Terrorists run our government.
[01:00:41.199 --> 01:00:42.259]  They are the Federal Reserve.
[01:00:42.299 --> 01:00:43.881]  They are the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:45.142]  They own the planet.
[01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.264]  They are enemies of humanity.
[01:00:47.764 --> 01:00:55.310]  David Rockefeller in his own autobiography three years ago, called Memoirs, said he's getting rid of the U.S.
[01:00:56.131 --> 01:00:57.112]  He runs it.
[01:00:59.194 --> 01:01:01.456]  Along with the rest of the crime board he sits on.
[01:01:02.817 --> 01:01:07.681]  And you out there are in denial, some of you listening right now, and I for one am tired of it.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.121]  The hour is late.
[01:01:09.181 --> 01:01:11.843]  Michael Rivero is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:11.863 --> 01:01:14.585]  We'll be taking your calls as well later in the shower.
[01:01:14.605 --> 01:01:15.186]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:15.566 --> 01:01:19.589]  Now, a few program notes here.
[01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:23.232]  I'll be on Coast to Coast AM for three hours tonight.
[01:01:24.974 --> 01:01:27.256]  Heard on over 600 radio stations nationwide.
[01:01:27.276 --> 01:01:28.677]  You can also listen via the Internet.
[01:01:30.619 --> 01:01:31.599]  Hope you'll join me.
[01:01:31.719 --> 01:01:37.024]  I'll be talking about the plunge of the dollar, world government-sponsored terrorism,
[01:01:38.539 --> 01:01:41.963]  And a few other key issues as well.
[01:01:43.024 --> 01:01:47.309]  So that is coming up tonight.
[01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:54.917]  Also, we have hundreds of thousands of people who tune in on the Internet alone each and every day.
[01:01:55.825 --> 01:01:56.305]  We're good to go.
[01:02:18.624 --> 01:02:20.905]  But every day it's hundreds of thousands on the Internet alone.
[01:02:20.965 --> 01:02:22.825]  We'll tell your friends and family to tune in.
[01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:31.728]  We can easily double our listenership every month, not every year like we've been doing, and reach more people, and bring down the New World Order.
[01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:37.150]  We can do it if we have the facts, and we have the determination, and we have the will.
[01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:42.312]  As constitutionalists, as Americans, we can do it.
[01:02:43.132 --> 01:02:46.313]  And all this evil being carried out in our name can be reversed.
[01:02:48.692 --> 01:02:51.314]  The alternative is total slavery, and I don't want to be part of that.
[01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:51.954]  What about you?
[01:02:53.255 --> 01:02:59.579]  Also, if you order by Friday, we ship it out to your UPS ground, you'll get it three or four days before Christmas.
[01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:00.920]  If you order by Friday.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.742]  Well, still, you can order the next day after that, and you might get it.
[01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:07.063]  You might get it if you even order the Monday after that, the 17th or 18th.
[01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:11.606]  But you need to go ahead and order so you can get it before Christmas.
[01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:15.247]  Makes great Christmas gifts, and your purchase makes what we do possible here.
[01:03:15.588 --> 01:03:25.653]  Go to InfoWars.com, get Terror Storm, get America, Freedom to Fascism, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions, the new film put out by Ken Jenkins, David Ray Griffin, amazing.
[01:03:26.073 --> 01:03:32.076]  All available at InfoWars.com on the secure online video bookstore, shopping cart, or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:03:36.793 --> 01:03:43.417]  Or give a PrisonPlanet.tv membership a monthly for $5.95 or get a year membership and get almost a half year free.
[01:03:43.437 --> 01:03:48.420]  5.3 months free until the end of December at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.441]  We'll be right back with Michael Levero.
[01:03:56.437 --> 01:03:59.600]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.882]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.242 --> 01:04:09.908]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.588 --> 01:04:17.634]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:20.997]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.337 --> 01:04:23.699]  The White House probed to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.119 --> 01:04:24.920]  NSA spies.
[01:04:26.334 --> 01:04:29.436]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:04:29.756 --> 01:04:33.239]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:35.661]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.981 --> 01:04:39.924]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:04:40.445 --> 01:04:48.211]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:53.194 --> 01:04:55.055]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:04:55.376 --> 01:04:56.917]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:04:57.317 --> 01:04:57.577]  What?
[01:04:57.938 --> 01:04:58.298]  Again?
[01:04:58.718 --> 01:05:00.339]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:05:00.399 --> 01:05:04.823]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:05:05.063 --> 01:05:06.364]  Why did you do that?
[01:05:06.564 --> 01:05:12.368]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:05:12.648 --> 01:05:13.689]  Are we there yet?
[01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:14.870]  for the entire trip.
[01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.312]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:18.793]  Great idea.
[01:05:18.813 --> 01:05:21.595]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:05:22.017 --> 01:05:24.482]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:05:24.702 --> 01:05:29.091]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:05:29.371 --> 01:05:29.712]  Honey!
[01:05:30.495 --> 01:05:31.736]  You're terrific!
[01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:33.618]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[01:05:33.738 --> 01:05:37.142]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[01:05:37.422 --> 01:05:38.223]  Now can we stop?
[01:05:38.723 --> 01:05:39.444]  I need to go, too.
[01:05:39.744 --> 01:05:44.189]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.249 --> 01:05:44.549]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:46.151]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:52.777 --> 01:05:53.357]  It's a fact.
[01:05:53.557 --> 01:05:57.979]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:05:58.319 --> 01:06:03.521]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:06:03.801 --> 01:06:07.002]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[01:06:07.262 --> 01:06:14.405]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:21.908]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:06:22.168 --> 01:06:24.269]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:30.994]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:06:31.234 --> 01:06:35.037]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:06:35.357 --> 01:06:36.838]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[01:06:37.038 --> 01:06:37.939]  Open 9 a.m.
[01:06:37.999 --> 01:06:38.819]  to 5 p.m.
[01:06:38.859 --> 01:06:40.360]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:40.800]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:41.861]  And ask for Robert.
[01:06:41.901 --> 01:06:44.883]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:06:53.341 --> 01:06:58.984]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:13.870]  Later in the show, I'm going to play that little two-and-a-half-minute clip from Sleeper Cell, American Terror, that airs on national cable television on Showtime.
[01:07:15.706 --> 01:07:21.048]  Where the Al-Qaeda members, the terrorists on the show, are sitting around joking after they've made love.
[01:07:22.349 --> 01:07:23.409]  The government carried out 9-11.
[01:07:23.469 --> 01:07:24.710]  I love it.
[01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:26.370]  Oh, they ran it from Building 7.
[01:07:27.231 --> 01:07:31.552]  Again, this is how they do it.
[01:07:31.672 --> 01:07:36.234]  And mindless people sit there and watch that and think, Why, people saying that?
[01:07:36.354 --> 01:07:37.655]  These with Al-Qaeda.
[01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:45.769]  Meanwhile, they've never watched the National Press Club with FBI agents breaking down and crying, holding up letters where they've been threatened to be arrested.
[01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:56.233]  Like Robert Wright, if they quote, tell you what they know about 9-11, all I can say is, the Bushes vacation with the Bin Ladens, and then breaking down and crying.
[01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.334]  I don't know why you don't just shoot your mouth off, right?
[01:07:59.354 --> 01:08:04.996]  Because you've got all those lawyers that were placed around you that you can trust who are telling you not to.
[01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:11.126]  I mean, this is the type of sick stuff we have to deal with.
[01:08:11.206 --> 01:08:21.850]  Imagine doing the research, knowing the facts, knowing terrorists run our government, both political parties, and just seeing the incredible propaganda.
[01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:22.811]  And I haven't mentioned this yet.
[01:08:22.831 --> 01:08:25.712]  I want to start with this, with Michael Rivera, who joins us once a month.
[01:08:25.732 --> 01:08:29.573]  He's going to be starting a new broadcast the first of the year on the weekend here.
[01:08:29.593 --> 01:08:33.415]  We're really honored to be having him with us.
[01:08:33.635 --> 01:08:34.475]  Great analysis.
[01:08:35.874 --> 01:08:37.514]  Great to have him part of the Genesis team.
[01:08:38.535 --> 01:08:42.476]  Incoming House Intelligence Chief botches easy intel quiz.
[01:08:44.496 --> 01:08:54.919]  Now, I covered Representative Sylvester Reyes of Texas last week, because remember he said we need 20,000 to 30,000 more troops, and the answer is a build-up and then a build-down later, but no set time frame.
[01:08:55.299 --> 01:08:59.320]  Exact same Bush policy, but the Democrats say it and act like Bush is against it,
[01:08:59.989 --> 01:09:07.155]  So they just put it into this process, and the Iraq Study Group comes out and acts like they're spanking Bush, and then the Democrats all jump on.
[01:09:07.535 --> 01:09:09.477]  It's just good cop, bad cop, smoke and mirrors.
[01:09:11.718 --> 01:09:14.821]  Incoming House Intelligence Chief botches easy intel quiz.
[01:09:14.861 --> 01:09:16.122]  Sylvester Reyes of Texas.
[01:09:17.463 --> 01:09:22.707]  The incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has tapped ahead of the Intelligence Committee when the Democrats take over in January.
[01:09:22.827 --> 01:09:26.490]  Failed a quiz of basic questions about Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah.
[01:09:28.138 --> 01:09:28.720]  We're good to go.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:42.562]  He didn't know that Hamas was a separate group.
[01:09:42.622 --> 01:09:43.622]  He didn't know any of it.
[01:09:43.942 --> 01:09:59.251]  When asked by CQ National Security Editor Jeff Stein whether Al-Qaeda is one of the other of two major branches of Islam, Sunni or Shiite, Reyes answered they are probably both, then ventured predominantly probably Shiite.
[01:10:00.131 --> 01:10:06.595]  No, the Shiites are a separate group, a minority group.
[01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:16.438]  And they think that you have to be directly descended from Muhammad to be part of... I mean, it's a wide area, but the point is they're always fighting with each other.
[01:10:17.219 --> 01:10:20.702]  And Al-Qaeda is more associated with our own government than anything else.
[01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:24.885]  It's a computer file name for Muslim extremist groups recruited in the 70s.
[01:10:25.186 --> 01:10:29.810]  They really were recruited after World War II, but really activated in the late 70s in Operation Cyclone.
[01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:31.231]  It was wrong!
[01:10:32.077 --> 01:10:36.880]  Al-Qaeda was founded by some of bin Laden as a Sunni organization and views Shiites as heretics.
[01:10:37.301 --> 01:10:41.383]  Yeah, they say Shiites are a greater threat than the great Satan Americans.
[01:10:42.824 --> 01:10:43.985]  And Americans aren't the great Satan.
[01:10:44.285 --> 01:10:48.408]  Our leaders are hijacked by who can only be described as the great Satan.
[01:10:48.948 --> 01:10:53.651]  Reyes could not answer questions put by Stein about Hezbollah, a Shiite group on the U.S.
[01:10:54.112 --> 01:10:56.874]  list of terrorist organizations.
[01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:01.897]  I always get Hezbollah.
[01:11:02.472 --> 01:11:09.514]  And Hamas mixed up myself, but then he was further asked about it and didn't know.
[01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:12.454]  Amazing.
[01:11:14.575 --> 01:11:14.995]  Amazing.
[01:11:16.255 --> 01:11:17.715]  Let's go to Michael Rivera.
[01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:19.076]  Michael, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:11:19.656 --> 01:11:20.396]  Hi, can you hear me?
[01:11:21.016 --> 01:11:21.356]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:22.136 --> 01:11:27.857]  Okay, yeah, sorry about that before, but the phones just all went dead right when I was going to talk to you before.
[01:11:27.877 --> 01:11:29.578]  Well, that's fine.
[01:11:29.598 --> 01:11:30.398]  You're on air with us now.
[01:11:30.438 --> 01:11:30.738]  Go ahead.
[01:11:31.275 --> 01:11:40.641]  Okay, well, first of all, I think obviously the big news right now, of course, is Olmert's admission the other day that Israel does, in fact, possess nuclear weapons.
[01:11:40.701 --> 01:11:44.324]  Of course, the government of Israel is attempting to backpedal that as quickly as they can.
[01:11:44.344 --> 01:11:45.725]  Well, they've got over 400.
[01:11:46.906 --> 01:11:51.989]  Yeah, they do, but Israel's official position has been never to admit, never to deny.
[01:11:52.870 --> 01:12:00.915]  And, of course, now that Olmert has basically just admitted that they do have the nuclear warheads, Israel is officially trying to backpedal from that
[01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.058]  And, you know, it's...
[01:12:28.495 --> 01:12:30.396]  Basically, Israel is not a weak nation.
[01:12:30.436 --> 01:12:31.657]  They are a nuclear power.
[01:12:32.017 --> 01:12:33.418]  Nobody is going to attack them.
[01:12:33.738 --> 01:12:38.021]  Meanwhile, we see all these staged incidents to justify Israel's attacking their neighbors.
[01:12:39.362 --> 01:12:52.849]  Absolutely, and I want to get into that, but let's talk about, as I read at the beginning of the article, this guy thinking that the Shiites are the Al-Qaeda-connected instead of the Sunni.
[01:12:55.191 --> 01:12:57.172]  The new head of our Senate Intelligence Committee, you mean.
[01:12:58.132 --> 01:12:58.452]  Yes.
[01:12:58.472 --> 01:13:07.201]  I mean, I want to talk about that because, and then of course get into the big Israel situation, which was next in my stack, because it illustrates.
[01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:12.967]  I mean, I try to be informed about the Middle East, and it's incredibly complex, and I get confused about it.
[01:13:13.007 --> 01:13:13.688]  We all do.
[01:13:14.048 --> 01:13:18.532]  But then you've got the average American who, what, 80 plus percent can't find Iraq on a map,
[01:13:19.773 --> 01:13:27.477]  Well, I think what that underscores is that the agenda that is being followed is not one that really feels it needs to pay attention to the reality of...
[01:13:48.408 --> 01:13:49.628]  What's going on in Iraq?
[01:13:50.169 --> 01:13:58.991]  Sylvester is not paying attention to who Al-Qaeda is because he realizes that Al-Qaeda is just a banner to be waved in service to the real agenda, which of course is U.S.
[01:13:59.031 --> 01:14:05.794]  military control of Mideast oil resources, certainly subservience to Israel's agenda in the region.
[01:14:06.014 --> 01:14:13.416]  Well, I mean, our military comes into whole towns and rounds up every male 11 and older, and if anybody fights back, they're called Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:13.436 --> 01:14:16.217]  It doesn't matter if they're Sunni, Shiite, Kurd, it doesn't matter.
[01:14:16.954 --> 01:14:20.436]  Yeah, it's just a label to be put on the people to dehumanize the victims.
[01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:28.701]  And what we're really dealing with are people who are resisting an armed invasion of their home and the capture and kidnapping of their loved ones.
[01:14:29.041 --> 01:14:41.168]  And if you really want to put it in context, go back and read the history of the American Revolution and how the British troops came in to American towns and villages and how the Americans fought back.
[01:14:41.653 --> 01:14:50.777]  And one thing you'll notice almost immediately is the British were at least a little bit more restrained in their actions against the Americans, but the Americans still fought back.
[01:14:50.817 --> 01:14:51.977]  They formed armed groups.
[01:14:52.258 --> 01:14:53.418]  They stockpiled weapons.
[01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:55.839]  They attempted to defend their homes militarily.
[01:14:56.099 --> 01:14:58.720]  This is exactly what we're seeing on the ground in Iraq.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.141]  These are not terrorists.
[01:15:00.341 --> 01:15:01.521]  They are not al-Qaeda.
[01:15:01.822 --> 01:15:10.005]  They are ordinary human beings, men, women, and even children, who are trying to protect their homes against a foreign invader, and that's what's going on.
[01:15:10.479 --> 01:15:16.383]  And the reason Sylvester isn't really paying attention to who makes up Al-Qaeda is because it doesn't really matter to him.
[01:15:16.884 --> 01:15:20.686]  Al-Qaeda and terrorists are just labels to serve the agenda of invasion.
[01:15:20.886 --> 01:15:32.495]  But even the official construct is the Saudi Arabian-based Sunnis, which are, again, in the hip pocket of the British and the intelligence agencies, and he doesn't know that, and he's saying it's the Shiites.
[01:15:33.475 --> 01:15:39.960]  Yeah, absolutely, and it just really indicates that the people who are in charge of this aren't really paying attention to the facts on the ground.
[01:15:40.861 --> 01:15:49.527]  Basically what it is, is the web of lies and deceptions that took us into war have become so complex that the liars themselves cannot keep track of it all.
[01:15:50.147 --> 01:15:53.329]  They can't keep track of what the current lie needs to be.
[01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:59.093]  Now, as far as the Saudis are concerned, this may be coming apart right now because the story just broke.
[01:15:59.133 --> 01:16:01.214]  It was buried on the back page of the Washington Post.
[01:16:01.614 --> 01:16:04.656]  But apparently the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.
[01:16:04.696 --> 01:16:06.577]  has just resigned and is heading home.
[01:16:07.038 --> 01:16:08.879]  Apparently rather unexpected.
[01:16:09.344 --> 01:16:13.545]  And while details are not forthcoming, it does seem like... That wasn't Bandar?
[01:16:14.085 --> 01:16:14.325]  Yes.
[01:16:14.885 --> 01:16:16.965]  Bandar Bush just... Oh, my!
[01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:20.406]  Bandar Bush just resigned?
[01:16:20.426 --> 01:16:21.206]  It just came out.
[01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:22.546]  I've got it on my front page.
[01:16:22.606 --> 01:16:25.367]  Let me go down here and read the actual article.
[01:16:25.427 --> 01:16:28.088]  His name is Bandar, but they call him Bandar Bush.
[01:16:28.408 --> 01:16:30.228]  Now, last time I checked, he was still ambassador.
[01:16:30.268 --> 01:16:31.168]  Maybe a new guy.
[01:16:31.548 --> 01:16:32.508]  But, yeah, is it Bandar?
[01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.889]  I'm pulling up the article right now to confirm that.
[01:16:36.969 --> 01:16:40.171]  But it says, no, this is Prince Turkey Al-Faisal.
[01:16:41.232 --> 01:16:42.193]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:16:42.213 --> 01:16:49.079]  Yeah, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States flew out of Washington yesterday after informing Secretary of State that he would be leaving the post.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:52.622]  So, yeah, he has basically left.
[01:16:54.003 --> 01:16:55.345]  Again, no DSL report coming.
[01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:58.928]  Now, Saudi Arabia has now figured out what's happening because Limbaugh has bragged about it.
[01:16:59.428 --> 01:17:02.551]  The globalists admit that the plan is to destabilize the whole region.
[01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:12.420]  Destruction, civil war, balkanization is the admitted program, going back to Israeli documents in 1983, 2002 Pentagon documents.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:17.385]  And so the Saudi king said, what, a week ago he said, or five days ago he said,
[01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:25.309]  The whole Middle East is about to implode and fall apart into total civil war, and maybe the Saudis are starting to get that they're being set up?
[01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:36.456]  Yeah, I would say that's probably what's going on, or alternatively, the Saudis have been made aware of the impending invasion of Iran, and they basically are starting to de-link.
[01:17:37.223 --> 01:17:42.486]  Because the longer they stay friends with the U.S., the more their immediate neighbors are seeing them as part of the problem.
[01:17:42.506 --> 01:17:43.827]  Well, that's what they said a few days ago.
[01:17:43.847 --> 01:17:47.689]  The king said, look, if you attack Iran, we're already going to probably have a revolution here.
[01:17:47.949 --> 01:17:49.170]  We can barely keep control.
[01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:50.291]  It was all over the news.
[01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.152]  And he said, please don't do it.
[01:17:52.492 --> 01:17:54.853]  But then meanwhile, Cheney's been over there in secret meetings.
[01:17:54.873 --> 01:17:55.774]  What do you think's going on there?
[01:17:56.474 --> 01:18:02.718]  Well, I think basically, you know, the push to find some reason to attack Iran is obviously still on.
[01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:11.639]  Cheney and Rice are flying all over trying to keep up support for this thing, but I think the support is really beginning to rapidly erode away.
[01:18:11.739 --> 01:18:17.120]  Well, Mr. Steele, a high-level former CIA operative, last week says they're going to attack by Christmas.
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.561]  I hope he's wrong, but a lot of people are saying that.
[01:18:20.241 --> 01:18:28.223]  Well, my concern is that Christmas is such an important holiday, and behind this whole war-making is this phrase, clash of civilizations.
[01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:32.684]  So Christmas, unfortunately, makes a very tempting target for another false flag terror attack.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:34.321]  Let's talk about Israel.
[01:18:34.361 --> 01:18:37.685]  I mean, would Olmert on accident spill the beans?
[01:18:37.905 --> 01:18:38.366]  I don't know.
[01:18:39.407 --> 01:18:41.709]  I mean, is this staged or do you think he just slipped up?
[01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:45.574]  I think he just slipped up because he lost his temper at the question.
[01:18:45.814 --> 01:18:46.555]  Well, stay there.
[01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:46.995]  Stay there.
[01:18:47.015 --> 01:18:50.659]  We're going to come back and talk about that and get into the really meat and potatoes of this.
[01:18:50.739 --> 01:18:52.181]  Is there going to be an attack on Iran?
[01:18:53.345 --> 01:18:54.325]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:18:54.405 --> 01:18:59.187]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:07.170]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:12.792]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:19:12.992 --> 01:19:19.974]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:19:20.234 --> 01:19:20.695]  We're good to go.
[01:19:42.017 --> 01:19:42.999]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.

[01:22:53.305 --> 01:22:53.626]  I think.
[01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:23.883]  In 1814 we took a little trip Along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi We took a little bacon and we took a little beans And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans We fired our guns and the British kept on coming There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to run it On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[01:23:26.787 --> 01:23:29.509]  We looked down a river and we seen the British come.
[01:23:29.609 --> 01:23:32.231]  And there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drum.
[01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:34.933]  They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring.
[01:23:35.213 --> 01:23:37.595]  We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
[01:23:37.695 --> 01:23:40.437]  We fired our guns and the British kept on coming.
[01:23:40.658 --> 01:23:43.079]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.520]  We fired once more.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.862]  Michael Rivera.
[01:23:46.882 --> 01:23:51.626]  Yes, the Saudi prince who replaced, about a year ago, Prince Bandar.
[01:23:52.941 --> 01:23:55.243]  Who left for personal reasons for 22 years on the job.
[01:23:55.263 --> 01:24:00.648]  Well, this new guy has left after a little more than a year on the job, citing personal reasons.
[01:24:02.109 --> 01:24:20.065]  And it says here that he claims it's happening because his brother, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saadi al-Faisal, is in ill health, noting rumors that the prince could be a possible replacement for Prince Saad.
[01:24:20.817 --> 01:24:21.578]  So, who knows?
[01:24:22.618 --> 01:24:26.742]  Going back to Michael Rivera, do you think they're going to hit Iran by Christmas?
[01:24:27.782 --> 01:24:31.025]  I know that there are a great many people who want that to happen.
[01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:44.915]  What I'm seeing within our own government, of course, is a continuing faction fight between the neocons and the war hawks and the incoming Congress, some of whom, at least, recognize that they were sent to Washington, D.C.
[01:24:44.935 --> 01:24:46.837]  with a clear anti-war mandate.
[01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:49.442]  So there's a lot of deal-making going on.
[01:24:49.482 --> 01:24:50.682]  There's a lot of faction fight.
[01:24:51.062 --> 01:25:05.186]  I think the most likely scenario is that the only real way they can get an attack on Iran going is with another false flag terrorist attack because the numbers of public support for the war continue to dwindle.
[01:25:05.966 --> 01:25:07.186]  There was a poll that came out today.
[01:25:07.226 --> 01:25:08.087]  Basically, 70% of Americans
[01:25:09.586 --> 01:25:11.408]  Disapprove of the handling of the Iraq War.
[01:25:12.008 --> 01:25:14.191]  60% of Americans don't think we should even be there.
[01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:17.454]  I'm not even sure the numbers are even that good for Bush.
[01:25:17.814 --> 01:25:22.738]  But the bottom line is... But meanwhile, neocons on Fox are saying, he's a lame duck, go ahead and attack Iran.
[01:25:23.639 --> 01:25:24.540]  I mean, they don't care.
[01:25:25.181 --> 01:25:30.005]  No, they absolutely don't because they're not answering to Bush or the American civil government or the American voter.
[01:25:30.345 --> 01:25:35.130]  They're there to push Israel's agenda of smashing up every other country in the Middle East.
[01:25:35.484 --> 01:25:43.989]  Well, I know there's an Israeli plan for greater Israel that spans the length and breadth of the Middle East, but certainly the oil companies have a lot of power, and so do the big banks.
[01:25:44.009 --> 01:25:45.529]  I mean, how do they play into this in your analysis?
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:08.665]  Well, I think the oil companies are going to go with whoever cuts them the best deal.
[01:26:09.285 --> 01:26:16.074]  And I think if Israel is a little less demanding tax-wise and environmental-wise than the U.S.
[01:26:16.114 --> 01:26:20.059]  government, that the oil companies will just switch over who they work for gladly.
[01:26:20.793 --> 01:26:30.062]  The problem with multinational corporations is that it's very hard to pin down just which nation they might be most loyal to of all the nations that they work in.
[01:26:30.742 --> 01:26:35.967]  Ultimately they're going to go and do business with whoever's got their hands on that big valve.
[01:26:36.307 --> 01:26:38.489]  Up until now it's mostly been the Arab nations.
[01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:41.652]  Israel has long resented...
[01:26:42.213 --> 01:26:52.318]  The fact that the oil money that countries like Saudi Arabia pour back into the United States in the form of investments buys with it a tremendous amount of political influence.
[01:26:52.679 --> 01:26:56.961]  So Israel's goal has been all along, because Israel doesn't put money into the U.S.
[01:26:56.981 --> 01:27:08.367]  Well, the reason I agree with you on this, and I don't think it's total influence, but I think they have one of the dominant influences, is I've heard Limbaugh and Hannity and others licking their lips for three years saying we should just go ahead and attack Saudi Arabia.
[01:27:09.353 --> 01:27:13.617]  And they've openly said, and then quote, take the oil.
[01:27:13.677 --> 01:27:14.558]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:27:15.539 --> 01:27:16.180]  Yeah, it is.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.042]  But that's really what we've come down to.
[01:27:19.263 --> 01:27:21.605]  And the big reason, of course, is the U.S.
[01:27:21.665 --> 01:27:25.449]  economy is really in very, very dangerous shape right now.
[01:27:25.829 --> 01:27:27.651]  We've got three forces pushing it down.
[01:27:27.711 --> 01:27:29.012]  We have the trade imbalance.
[01:27:29.668 --> 01:27:31.831]  And the dollar is sinking.
[01:27:31.851 --> 01:27:34.595]  Yeah, it's lost half its value in the last five years alone.
[01:27:46.162 --> 01:27:50.084]  The only thing that is reversible is the trade imbalance.
[01:27:50.564 --> 01:27:52.325]  I think the thinking in Washington, D.C.
[01:27:52.365 --> 01:27:53.206]  was that if the U.S.
[01:27:53.266 --> 01:28:01.910]  grabs control of the Mideast oil, technically that turns it from an imported product to an exported product if American oil companies are put in charge of it.
[01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:06.052]  And it keeps OPEC on American-controlled petrodollars.
[01:28:06.933 --> 01:28:08.153]  Absolutely, it does that.
[01:28:08.273 --> 01:28:09.254]  It also gives the U.S.
[01:28:09.314 --> 01:28:11.555]  leverage against its creditor nations to say,
[01:28:12.335 --> 01:28:16.938]  Look, you know, if you get too demanding about the money that we owe you, we'll just cut off the oil flow to you.
[01:28:17.259 --> 01:28:18.920]  It's just simply grabbing the energy.
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:19.920]  It is.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:23.983]  Plus, of course, control of oil is control of all conventional war fighting for the next century.
[01:28:26.665 --> 01:28:27.525]  Oh, man.
[01:28:28.466 --> 01:28:40.374]  Meanwhile, there are very people attacking the Middle East or dismantling our sovereignty, destroying our republic, and we serve them willingly like smiley-faced baboons.
[01:28:43.698 --> 01:28:44.580]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:46.703]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.624 --> 01:28:50.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.447 --> 01:28:59.570]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:01.551]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.811 --> 01:29:08.095]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.396 --> 01:29:14.520]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.784]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.084 --> 01:29:27.491]  With no side effects, the 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:27.631 --> 01:29:31.175]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:31.476 --> 01:29:35.180]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.903]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:38.043 --> 01:29:39.084]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:39.104 --> 01:29:39.384]  That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[01:29:53.197 --> 01:29:53.958]  Terrorism.
[01:29:54.098 --> 01:29:54.858]  Terrorism.
[01:29:54.958 --> 01:29:55.799]  Chemical attacks.
[01:29:55.879 --> 01:29:56.540]  Dirty bombs.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.060]  Fallout.
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.141]  Biological attack.
[01:29:58.301 --> 01:29:58.842]  Anthrax.
[01:29:58.922 --> 01:30:01.023]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:30:01.284 --> 01:30:02.885]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:05.607]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:30:05.987 --> 01:30:20.559]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:30:20.599 --> 01:30:20.919]  government.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.861]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:30:23.261 --> 01:30:29.164]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:30:29.304 --> 01:30:33.807]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:30:34.067 --> 01:30:39.730]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:32:24.093 --> 01:32:28.255]  And our guest is Mike Rivero with WhatReallyHappened.com.
[01:32:28.275 --> 01:32:32.317]  We'll be starting first of the year, a new weekend radio show.
[01:32:32.557 --> 01:32:36.539]  Mike, before we get back into the news, tell us about the new transmission you'll be doing.
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:42.422]  Well, I will be joining you on GCN Live, Saturdays at 11 a.m.
[01:32:42.462 --> 01:32:44.803]  to 12 noon Central Time.
[01:32:45.704 --> 01:32:47.245]  We'll be taking phone calls.
[01:32:47.265 --> 01:32:49.906]  We'll be having guests, and I hope, of course, that you will be one of them.
[01:32:51.348 --> 01:32:56.750]  And basically fill in that gap on the weekend when the listeners cannot reach your show.
[01:32:58.171 --> 01:32:59.071]  I'm excited about it.
[01:32:59.091 --> 01:33:04.653]  A lot of great folks joining the Genesis team, and I'm really excited about you joining, Michael Rivera.
[01:33:05.274 --> 01:33:12.537]  Before we go to calls, here looking at this, we know that Israel was chartered and helped set up by the British and the U.S.
[01:33:12.597 --> 01:33:15.898]  We know that a very powerful interest in England,
[01:33:16.713 --> 01:33:17.174]  We're good to go.
[01:33:17.254 --> 01:33:17.414]  I think?
[01:33:35.712 --> 01:33:48.235]  But it was that very same elite that helped put the neocons in, who I see as folks, they just kind of gave the ball and let them run with the ball, and then if they fall down, they kind of take the blame and they remove them and keep moving forward.
[01:33:49.535 --> 01:33:55.836]  I mean, certainly this whole New World Order system has competing factions, but it's like a crime syndicator and the Godfather.
[01:33:56.196 --> 01:34:02.998]  They still meet and get around the round table and make decisions about the general direction and policy of the world.
[01:34:03.558 --> 01:34:04.578]  Give me your take on that.
[01:34:05.594 --> 01:34:12.719]  Well, I tend to agree that they still meet together, but I don't know that that necessarily means that they're unified.
[01:34:13.759 --> 01:34:30.250]  Certainly within the United States, you have a very clear, obvious conflict of interest between those people who want to support Israel and those interests who still recognize that we are very dependent upon Arab oil to fuel our economy.
[01:34:31.282 --> 01:34:37.686]  And the real politic has been how do we keep both factions happy because we don't want the Arabs to shut off the valve.
[01:34:38.286 --> 01:34:50.332]  And at the same time, the Israel factor, of course, is still inescapable in American politics through AIPAC, through various other mechanisms by which they hold control over our government.
[01:34:51.533 --> 01:34:55.935]  None more obvious, I think, than the way Nancy Pelosi has stood up in Congress
[01:34:56.694 --> 01:35:07.224]  And just announced ahead of time, there will be no investigations of the lies that took us to war, that there will be no attempts to impeach President Bush for lying us into the war.
[01:35:07.925 --> 01:35:18.314]  Obviously, they're not worried about protecting Bush, but they are worried about protecting the various parties who were behind all of the lies that led to war, possibly even including 9-11 itself.
[01:35:18.674 --> 01:35:22.738]  It's one of those situations where they don't dare let any one thread
[01:35:27.835 --> 01:35:29.396]  Certainly, one of those loose ends.
[01:35:29.616 --> 01:35:42.547]  Now, with this deck of cards, we know there's a real split in Bilderberg that really reared its head four years ago, five years ago, 2002, when they were building towards the invasion.
[01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.459]  I think we're good to go.
[01:36:07.136 --> 01:36:26.387]  That they want to go ahead and have Armageddon and go ahead and have a big war, and they believe that just by getting us into such a huge conflict that we'll then be forced, the people, to serve in that global clash, World War IV, the neocons see World War III as the Cold War, that then by forcing us to engage...
[01:36:27.127 --> 01:36:28.568]  But then a lot of the old liners...
[01:36:56.084 --> 01:36:56.684]  We're good to go.
[01:36:56.704 --> 01:36:57.365]  We're good to go.
[01:37:14.315 --> 01:37:15.096]  We're good to go.
[01:37:15.156 --> 01:37:16.436]  We're good to go.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:37.601]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:38.141 --> 01:37:44.225]  It is very clear that events on the ground in the Mideast are not matching the expectations of the planners.
[01:37:45.266 --> 01:37:56.413]  And we see this repeated in history time and time again where a bunch of really bright boys will get in some very comfortable room in some nation's capital and they'll draw up a plan and say, oh, this is how it's all going to work.
[01:37:56.815 --> 01:38:01.876]  And then they get into the reality of what they've created, and it's not going the way it's planned.
[01:38:02.097 --> 01:38:24.843]  I liken the old line globalist as, say, Stalin, and then the other side as Hitler, and so they make pacts with each other, but the neocons cannot be restrained in their imperial lust, the war lust, the warmonger tyrant lust, and that it is some type of struggle going on.
[01:38:25.664 --> 01:38:34.194]  Yeah, there is, and on one side you've got a group of people who can never admit that they were wrong, who will keep the war going rather than admit that they were wrong.
[01:38:34.514 --> 01:38:39.400]  Excuse me, what you said earlier about the Christian evangelicals,
[01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:50.793]  These are people who are all hot and bothered to go on to a major global war, and they don't care if it's won or lost, because their end result is that Jesus is going to come down and invite them up to the big house when it's all over.
[01:38:50.893 --> 01:38:53.154]  As if they're going to tell Jesus what to do.
[01:38:53.214 --> 01:38:58.415]  I've heard these preachers, we've played clips, saying that they're going to force God to do something.
[01:38:58.455 --> 01:39:00.656]  Boy, that is blasphemy.
[01:39:01.436 --> 01:39:02.656]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[01:39:02.716 --> 01:39:09.058]  It's also arrogant in the extreme that we can set things up so that God will be forced to act,
[01:39:09.463 --> 01:39:19.827]  There's one school of thought that Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus to the Romans because he believed that would force Jesus to expose his godlike powers.
[01:39:19.847 --> 01:39:24.408]  Of course, that didn't work out the way it was planned, if you go along with that particular theory.
[01:39:24.909 --> 01:39:28.390]  But, yeah, we've got a lot of people who want war to happen.
[01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:32.471]  They don't care about its cost because the costs are always going to be dumped on other people.
[01:39:32.791 --> 01:39:37.153]  They just see at the end of it some glorious treasure or some other fulfillment already.
[01:39:38.379 --> 01:39:41.000]  Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.882]  These are really power-mad, totally decadent people.
[01:39:44.262 --> 01:39:48.545]  No amount of gay porn star mistresses will make them happy.
[01:39:49.045 --> 01:39:53.268]  And so, literally, that's what power-mad people have always done.
[01:39:53.328 --> 01:39:56.950]  They want a war to basically challenge their power.
[01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:57.891]  It's like gambling.
[01:39:58.692 --> 01:39:59.732]  Yeah, it is.
[01:39:59.852 --> 01:40:02.514]  It's playing the game of Empire, but with the real planet.
[01:40:02.994 --> 01:40:05.656]  And they don't understand and appreciate...
[01:40:06.409 --> 01:40:16.836]  What they're causing to the common human being because they're so above the idea of ever going hungry for a day, they are literally blind to the misery that war is going to cause other people.
[01:40:17.196 --> 01:40:17.977]  It is just a game.
[01:40:18.057 --> 01:40:19.037]  It's a roll of the dice.
[01:40:19.438 --> 01:40:20.098]  It's numbers.
[01:40:20.258 --> 01:40:22.139]  I get to stand on this and say I own it all.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:33.987]  And there seems to be a curse on the entire planet that every so many hundred years we get some maniac coming along who dreams that he can own it all and doesn't matter how many people he kills trying to prove it.
[01:40:34.912 --> 01:40:40.224]  But in this case, I do believe that the neocon path that our country is currently on right now...
[01:40:40.735 --> 01:40:41.956]  ...is doomed to failure.
[01:40:42.216 --> 01:40:47.418]  They cannot attain what they think they can attain, and a lot of people are going to get hurt in the process.
[01:40:47.618 --> 01:40:48.618]  And I interrupted you earlier.
[01:40:48.638 --> 01:40:54.961]  You were talking about they always get together in the smoky rooms, like Hitler turning east, and just think that they can take over the whole world.
[01:40:55.461 --> 01:41:03.484]  And then when they start getting bogged down with their axles, they tend to just intensify and start attacking other countries, thinking, well, at least I can win here, or at least I can win there.
[01:41:03.584 --> 01:41:07.306]  Some new war will divert the people's attention, and you're going to finish up.
[01:41:07.996 --> 01:41:10.297]  Well, basically you're on the right track there.
[01:41:10.657 --> 01:41:17.700]  When they get bogged down in it, they start thinking that any victory is politically good, even if it's not the victory they originally defined.
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:24.102]  This is the problem that we face in Iraq, or not necessarily we, but Bush and his administration facing Iraq.
[01:41:24.542 --> 01:41:32.045]  We were sold this war on the claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that Iraq was aiding Al-Qaeda, that Iraq had something to do with 9-11.
[01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:36.507]  Since none of those were true, political victory...
[01:41:37.165 --> 01:41:42.526]  In that we can accomplish the objectives that we went into Iraq with is absolutely impossible.
[01:41:42.826 --> 01:41:57.750]  And I think a big reason for the push to go into Iran is to develop a new front in a new war in the hope that when that war is won, if ever, that that will erase the fact that we didn't really quite accomplish what we were told we were going to accomplish in Iraq.
[01:41:58.496 --> 01:42:05.060]  So right now we have a war in Iraq that cannot be won politically because the stated objectives are impossible.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.642]  We can hang on for a long time or we can lose.
[01:42:09.082 --> 01:42:10.403]  So the only way for the U.S.
[01:42:10.443 --> 01:42:13.084]  to distract from that is to create another war someplace else.
[01:42:13.104 --> 01:42:21.449]  But why don't they just declare that, okay, now there's an elected government, there's still some problems, but they'll fix it, and then just pull out and then it would leave a lot of the pages.
[01:42:22.610 --> 01:42:26.671]  It would absolutely reduce the issue of terrorism and sectarian violence in Iraq.
[01:42:26.791 --> 01:42:31.112]  That's the CIA assessment, but they don't want that because they want to build a permanent basis to control the oil.
[01:42:31.553 --> 01:42:32.773]  That's absolutely right.
[01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:38.274]  Plus, of course, Israel does not want Iraq left by the Americans until it is shattered into lots of little tiny pieces.
[01:42:38.755 --> 01:42:50.978]  And, of course, while the United States is on the ground in Iraq, Israel feels that it can attack Iran with impunity because the path for an Iranian counterattack is going to go right through our young people in uniform.
[01:42:51.477 --> 01:42:51.957]  In Iraq.
[01:42:51.997 --> 01:42:55.279]  So Israel does not want that group of people to go away.
[01:42:55.379 --> 01:42:57.780]  Well, it's clear Israel wants to lure the U.S.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.541]  into a new world war.
[01:43:00.141 --> 01:43:01.542]  Absolutely they do.
[01:43:01.902 --> 01:43:04.443]  Israel is a master at playing let's you and him fight.
[01:43:04.763 --> 01:43:06.224]  They would love to see the U.S.
[01:43:06.264 --> 01:43:17.909]  and even Russia locked in a mutually destructive conflict, which would leave Israel with its nuclear arsenal in charge of the Middle East, if not a major part of Europe and Asia as well.
[01:43:18.553 --> 01:43:24.117]  Israel's also, members of their Knesset have said that they threaten to nuke Europe if they don't go along.
[01:43:24.557 --> 01:43:25.678]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:43:25.918 --> 01:43:31.321]  And this is why Olmert's recent admission really was a serious mistake.
[01:43:31.341 --> 01:43:32.262]  Oh yeah, let's get into that.
[01:43:32.322 --> 01:43:34.443]  Why do you think he really slipped up?
[01:43:35.204 --> 01:43:36.325]  I think he really slipped up.
[01:43:36.385 --> 01:43:39.687]  Now, of course, the Jerusalem Post has already changed the story that's
[01:43:40.326 --> 01:43:44.348]  ...at the end of the link to basically pull back and say, no, that's not what he said.
[01:43:44.388 --> 01:43:47.170]  He was just saying Germany should cut funding to Iran, blah, blah, blah.
[01:43:47.470 --> 01:44:09.723]  But I kept the original article as it was posted by the Jerusalem Post, and it basically says that the German television interviewer asked him if the fact that Israel possessed nuclear weapons weakened the West's position against Iran, also possessing nuclear weapons, and Olmert apparently lost his temper...
[01:44:10.285 --> 01:44:12.386]  Saying, Israel, we don't threaten anybody.
[01:44:13.086 --> 01:44:14.567]  You know, we are peaceful users.
[01:44:14.807 --> 01:44:22.809]  And basically said to the effect that Israel was responsible enough to use nuclear weapons along with Great Britain and the United States.
[01:44:22.829 --> 01:44:25.130]  But why do we even need Israel to admit it?
[01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:26.791]  I mean, they don't allow inspection.
[01:44:26.831 --> 01:44:28.531]  They admittedly have over 400 weapons.
[01:44:28.571 --> 01:44:31.693]  They've bought cruise missiles, submarines, medium-range missiles.
[01:44:31.753 --> 01:44:34.213]  I mean, we know they've had nukes since the 60s.
[01:44:34.253 --> 01:44:37.635]  Well, why is it even, why are we even, who cares what they say?
[01:44:37.675 --> 01:44:38.435]  We know they've got them.
[01:44:38.835 --> 01:44:56.548]  Well, because this gets down to political perceptions, because as long as Israel was denying they had nuclear weapons, they could go on pretending, oh, we're victims, you've got to send us money, we are justified in attacking Lebanon because we're poor little Israel, and Hezbollah and Hamas are such a threat to us.
[01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:59.130]  Now they can't do that anymore.
[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:03.313]  They're trying to backpedal away from Omer's admission, but this one is not going to go away.
[01:45:03.794 --> 01:45:05.255]  Israel is a nuclear power.
[01:45:05.315 --> 01:45:06.476]  We've known it since the new, new...
[01:45:07.409 --> 01:45:10.872]  Publish the photos about the weapons lab that's hidden under the Dimona reactor.
[01:45:11.692 --> 01:45:19.358]  So now it makes it very difficult for people who support Israel to stand up and say, we must support Israel because they are defenseless against the Arab nations.
[01:45:19.638 --> 01:45:20.359]  No, they're not.
[01:45:20.399 --> 01:45:22.721]  They're the only nuclear power in the region.
[01:45:22.761 --> 01:45:26.263]  Well, it's the fifth overall military force with conventional weapons.
[01:45:27.264 --> 01:45:28.025]  Absolutely.
[01:45:28.285 --> 01:45:35.110]  And the really hard part is that this underscores the lies that we went into Iraq with.
[01:45:35.447 --> 01:45:41.329]  We went to war in Iraq because they supposedly possess banned weapons of mass destruction.
[01:45:41.710 --> 01:45:45.571]  Now we find out that Iraq didn't have them, but Israel really does.
[01:45:46.031 --> 01:45:52.414]  And a lot of people who are stuck fighting this war in Iraq have got to be scratching their head right now saying, why are we even here?
[01:45:54.929 --> 01:46:01.313]  Even if Iraq had had weapons of mass destruction, they were never going to attack Israel because Israel could retaliate.
[01:46:01.333 --> 01:46:02.594]  Well, the globalists got their way.
[01:46:02.634 --> 01:46:05.376]  They sucked us into World War I, staged by the British.
[01:46:05.697 --> 01:46:06.958]  That then created Hitler.
[01:46:07.018 --> 01:46:08.539]  We were sucked into World War II.
[01:46:09.159 --> 01:46:11.181]  And now here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:11.221 --> 01:46:13.302]  We had World War III with the Cold War.
[01:46:13.322 --> 01:46:15.524]  This is what the Pentagon and the neocons call it.
[01:46:15.864 --> 01:46:17.666]  And now we're going to be sucked into a hot war.
[01:46:18.326 --> 01:46:20.528]  Is there anything that can stop us being sucked into this?
[01:46:22.507 --> 01:46:26.470]  Yeah, just everybody standing up and saying, no, I refuse to go along.
[01:46:26.670 --> 01:46:28.731]  And let me elaborate on that just a little bit.
[01:46:29.452 --> 01:46:34.135]  First of all, the thing I really hate about going into World War IV is that we're the bad guys this time.
[01:46:34.535 --> 01:46:39.499]  Somebody spun a little wheel and the arrow came up and said, okay, this time the United States gets to be the bad guys.
[01:46:39.939 --> 01:46:45.883]  So we're the ones who are going... And meanwhile, we're being used by these multinational global forces as their front.
[01:46:46.303 --> 01:46:48.725]  We're not even the real bad guy, we're a front bad guy.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:58.589]  Yeah, we're a front bad guy, and of course the purpose of the war is to destroy work product so that the world's population can be kept working going into the future.
[01:46:59.069 --> 01:47:03.153]  But going into this idea about another world war...
[01:47:05.638 --> 01:47:10.999]  Oh, I lost the thought that I was going to say about... Okay, I lost that thought.
[01:47:11.279 --> 01:47:19.322]  But going into this World War situation, it's going to kill a lot of people and it's going to destroy a lot of property.
[01:47:21.094 --> 01:47:27.760]  And the only thing that is really going to stop it is for the people to simply say, I refuse to go along with it en masse.
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.222]  And that may mean general strikes.
[01:47:31.523 --> 01:47:34.005]  We are in a very unique situation here with this war.
[01:47:35.246 --> 01:47:40.450]  There is nothing new about leaders lying to their populations to trick them into war.
[01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:42.171]  It's been going on all along.
[01:47:42.291 --> 01:47:49.117]  But in the present situation, we have a unique moment in history because the lies that launched this war...
[01:47:49.685 --> 01:47:55.206]  are known to the majority of the population of the nation while that war is still going on.
[01:47:55.327 --> 01:47:58.627]  That particular circumstance has never happened before.
[01:47:59.128 --> 01:48:14.432]  And this is why we're seeing these disastrously low poll numbers for the Bush administration, which makes pushing into Iran very problematic, because at some point the American people are going to reach a flashpoint and say, we're not going to go along with this anymore.
[01:48:14.592 --> 01:48:16.052]  And the example I like to push back
[01:48:16.454 --> 01:48:16.955]  Ceaușescu.
[01:48:17.115 --> 01:48:17.555]  Say again?
[01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:17.875]  Ceaușescu, yeah.
[01:48:39.534 --> 01:48:55.721]  So, I suspect that we are nearing a similar flashpoint here, where everybody is going to look around and realize that everybody else around them is just as angry, just as pissed off at the government at this pointless war of conquest that we were lied into.
[01:48:55.741 --> 01:48:57.402]  Well, the poll numbers show that already.
[01:48:57.842 --> 01:48:59.543]  Yeah, it's definitely getting there.
[01:48:59.883 --> 01:49:03.445]  And so, those people who are pushing into a war in Iran...
[01:49:05.044 --> 01:49:13.031]  The really dangerous possibility is that they are completely not paying attention to what's going on on the streets of America and how the public is feeling.
[01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:20.937]  They may be believing their public relations people that the propaganda is succeeding and that Americans are supporting the war in Iran.
[01:49:21.558 --> 01:49:31.766]  The real danger when you get a very large governmental structure is everybody in the middle is lying to cover their own asses and the people at the top may be really blind to what the population is thinking.
[01:49:31.786 --> 01:49:34.388]  Well, that happens over and over again.
[01:49:35.770 --> 01:49:40.012]  And that blindness is what leads them on to hideous mistakes of judgment.
[01:49:40.892 --> 01:49:48.334]  Well, we know that their think tanks are telling them back off, but their answer is to press harder on the accelerator.
[01:49:48.574 --> 01:49:49.775]  We'll come back, take a few calls.
[01:49:49.795 --> 01:49:50.215]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.698 --> 01:49:59.859]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:02.180]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:10.204]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.864 --> 01:50:17.927]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.327 --> 01:50:21.268]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:23.969]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:25.230]  NSA spies.

[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:21.404]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:21.444 --> 01:51:23.765]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:54.596 --> 01:53:14.282]  Let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls.
[01:53:14.382 --> 01:53:16.222]  Travis in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:53:16.302 --> 01:53:16.682]  Welcome.
[01:53:17.242 --> 01:53:18.143]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:18.203 --> 01:53:19.203]  Travis Call from Austin.
[01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:23.404]  Look, you guys are talking about how quickly things can change.
[01:53:23.605 --> 01:53:28.672]  What is it going to take to get our honorable military people to start thinking about getting rid of these criminals?
[01:53:29.153 --> 01:53:32.758]  Have you guys ever heard any chatter out there about the possibility of a coup?
[01:53:34.039 --> 01:53:35.160]  I've heard a lot about that.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.082]  The problem is that's very dangerous to our system of government.
[01:53:38.122 --> 01:53:46.269]  The internal global forces could actually stage a coup and put in a dictatorship instantly in the name of cleaning things up.
[01:53:47.389 --> 01:53:50.612]  But at a certain point, I mean, the process is leading that way.
[01:53:50.652 --> 01:53:59.319]  The top generals, though, it isn't like Smedley Butler, the big Marine Corps Congressional Medal of Honor winning general, when they tried to hire him, the Bushes, and others.
[01:53:59.959 --> 01:54:02.421]  Well, I'd like to go back to the Ukrainian protests, because when that happened,
[01:54:29.717 --> 01:54:36.401]  What we saw was not the police and the military staging the coup, but simply abandoning the government and joining with the protesters.
[01:54:37.141 --> 01:54:40.604]  And that's what ultimately forced the Prime Minister to step down.
[01:54:40.984 --> 01:54:44.606]  I agree with Alex that a military coup is fraught with peril.
[01:54:45.467 --> 01:54:51.430]  I'd like to temper that, however, with the observation that most military people I know are staunch constitutionalists.
[01:54:52.811 --> 01:54:56.794]  And, you know, if you start getting to a situation where something is going to happen...
[01:54:58.173 --> 01:55:01.474]  You have to start evaluating which is the best course of what is going to happen.
[01:55:01.834 --> 01:55:03.214]  Yeah, I think the military is good.
[01:55:03.274 --> 01:55:07.555]  The problem is they get tricked and lied to, and they're quite dutiful.
[01:55:07.995 --> 01:55:12.176]  And so will they be able to be sophisticated enough to recognize a false flag?
[01:55:12.536 --> 01:55:15.617]  And we saw them go confiscate the guns in New Orleans when they were ordered to.
[01:55:16.557 --> 01:55:17.858]  Yeah, absolutely they were.
[01:55:18.218 --> 01:55:23.919]  And I think we need to look back at the Clinton administration, because back then there were a lot of top,
[01:55:24.511 --> 01:55:32.735]  Senior military commanders of the type that we would think would really be loyal to the idea of America rather than loyal to individuals.
[01:55:33.075 --> 01:55:35.896]  And they were all very quietly being given early retirement.
[01:55:35.916 --> 01:55:37.917]  Or getting shot twice in the chest.
[01:55:38.117 --> 01:55:39.398]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:40.258 --> 01:55:41.379]  Some of them were killed outright.
[01:55:41.639 --> 01:55:46.421]  But a lot of the commanders that we would expect to be the focus point of a military...
[01:55:46.923 --> 01:55:48.944]  Yeah, they got fellow travelers in place now.
[01:56:01.312 --> 01:56:08.895]  So, I mean, clearly the top military brass at the time had to be at least partially involved in 9-11, too, knowing it was going on.
[01:56:08.935 --> 01:56:09.196]  Michael?
[01:56:09.656 --> 01:56:10.616]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:56:11.356 --> 01:56:21.521]  Certainly when you have all those military exercises that were taking place at the same time, which involved airplanes being hijacked, this is why civilian flight controllers...
[01:56:21.971 --> 01:56:22.712]  Travis, anything else?
[01:56:22.752 --> 01:56:23.352]  The beast system, guys.
[01:56:23.372 --> 01:56:23.732]  I appreciate it.
[01:56:23.752 --> 01:56:24.153]  Thank you.
[01:56:24.193 --> 01:56:24.813]  Good to hear from you.
[01:56:37.542 --> 01:56:38.323]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:38.423 --> 01:56:39.003]  We'll be back.
[01:56:39.183 --> 01:56:41.125]  We'll do five more minutes with Michael Rivero if he can do it.
[01:56:41.145 --> 01:56:43.046]  And we'll talk to Dan and Jeffrey at least.
[01:56:43.066 --> 01:56:46.028]  Then we'll get to another Dan and Frank and others.
[01:56:46.689 --> 01:56:49.991]  And we'll be talking about the 9-11 protests that's coming up later.
[01:56:50.011 --> 01:56:53.593]  Then I'll get into a whole bunch of other news I haven't covered yet.
[01:56:54.194 --> 01:57:04.461]  But before we break, Michael, have you seen this new sleeper cell thing from Showtime where the terrorists are sitting around laughing at 9-11 truth, making jokes about the government being involved in the attacks?
[01:57:04.481 --> 01:57:04.541]  Yes.
[01:57:05.448 --> 01:57:09.610]  I'm afraid I haven't seen that yet, but I will take a look at it.
[01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:11.331]  It's amazing.
[01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:14.212]  I'm going to play that later in the next hour one more time.
[01:57:14.292 --> 01:57:18.154]  It's just, I mean, the propaganda is getting so base now.
[01:57:19.314 --> 01:57:22.436]  Oh, 9-11 truth is Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:24.777]  Oh, we now see.
[01:57:25.477 --> 01:57:27.758]  I mean, that is not going to work on people anymore.
[01:57:28.618 --> 01:57:29.939]  The propagandas are fools.
[01:57:33.815 --> 01:57:36.778]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:36.818 --> 01:57:37.078]  Big Brother.
[01:57:37.098 --> 01:57:38.019]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.039 --> 01:57:38.580]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:38.620 --> 01:57:39.000]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.144 --> 01:57:57.005]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.025 --> 01:58:01.347]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.888 --> 01:58:06.010]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.734 --> 01:58:19.859]  Final signal, Michael Rivera starting a new broadcaster on Genesis, the first of the year.
[01:58:22.193 --> 01:58:23.914]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:58:23.954 --> 01:58:25.575]  Let's talk to Dan in Washington.
[01:58:25.615 --> 01:58:27.136]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Dan.
[01:58:28.097 --> 01:58:29.057]  Actually, it's David Alex.
[01:58:29.537 --> 01:58:30.538]  I just wanted to talk about it.
[01:58:30.638 --> 01:58:36.602]  It's not related to the subject you two were talking about, but I just got out of my local county jail for...
[01:58:37.887 --> 01:58:48.359]  Some ridiculous charges, and most of the people in there, Alex, are in there on ridiculous probation violations, failure to pay on constitutional fines, and some of the human rights violations I saw in there were pretty ridiculous.
[01:58:48.379 --> 01:58:49.521]  Yeah, the government's criminal.
[01:58:49.581 --> 01:58:52.985]  We have over 7 million people in the system, more than any other country in the world.
[01:58:53.545 --> 01:58:54.105]  We're good to go.
[01:59:14.276 --> 01:59:15.497]  Yeah, I saw that commercial.
[01:59:15.617 --> 01:59:16.517]  It was ridiculous.
[01:59:16.537 --> 01:59:20.679]  Yeah, the new economy, all the big new scholarships, they're taking over the universities.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:24.622]  The jobs are going to be a military dictatorship.
[01:59:25.642 --> 01:59:27.163]  Michael Rivero, comments on that?
[01:59:27.863 --> 01:59:32.386]  Well, one wonders how you're going to pay for all of this, because the problem with...
[01:59:33.646 --> 01:59:39.489]  Security guards and all of these other positions, they don't actually make a product you can sell.
[01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:43.730]  And at some point... But you just tax and imprison people and seize their property.
[01:59:44.451 --> 01:59:45.571]  It's a predatory system.
[01:59:46.251 --> 01:59:49.313]  It absolutely is, but it's a self-feeding, self-consuming system.
[01:59:49.653 --> 02:00:00.757]  Because without new money coming in from outside the country, this kind of a system eventually implodes on itself because as the money circulates around internally, the government simply takes more and more of it.
[02:00:00.777 --> 02:00:02.738]  But there's no new money coming into the system
[02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:09.070]  Meanwhile, the money that's there is being dead-ended in jobs and occupations that produce no goods that can be sold.
[02:00:10.811 --> 02:00:12.271]  But we've got to fight Al-Qaeda.
[02:00:15.492 --> 02:00:18.033]  Why don't we just hire them and give them jobs, and I think they'll calm down.
[02:00:18.213 --> 02:00:21.053]  So what was going on in this loving facility you were in?
[02:00:21.293 --> 02:00:31.256]  Well, the first thing I saw, the first day I was in there, before they move you into an open bay pod, is what they're called, is that... Hold on, I'm going to...
[02:00:31.969 --> 02:00:32.369]  There we go.
[02:00:32.429 --> 02:00:33.750]  Yeah, we need to go ahead and get your points.
[02:00:34.011 --> 02:00:36.933]  Yeah, there was a Muslim person in there.
[02:00:36.973 --> 02:00:38.034]  He was a nice enough guy.
[02:00:38.674 --> 02:00:41.076]  And they were serving us sausages with our meals.
[02:00:41.116 --> 02:00:43.258]  And he was trying to find out whether or not there was pork in there.
[02:00:44.178 --> 02:00:47.841]  And the female corrections officer he was talking to refused to give him an answer.
[02:00:48.001 --> 02:00:56.908]  And when he demanded his rights, you know, as the meal that he told them that he needed to have, you know, free of pork, she immediately got angry.
[02:00:57.529 --> 02:01:03.522]  In his face, yelling at him, and when he tried to defend his point of view, they put him on lockdown for like 10 days.
[02:01:04.628 --> 02:01:07.569]  Well, talking's wrong, but listen, that's nothing, sir.
[02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:11.191]  They've shut down four prisons right around Austin in the last few years.
[02:01:11.271 --> 02:01:13.832]  At one of them, they would rape all the women, and it said all.
[02:01:14.152 --> 02:01:15.533]  They would make videotapes of it.
[02:01:15.793 --> 02:01:18.294]  At another one, the men would rape the men and video it.
[02:01:18.314 --> 02:01:19.375]  They thought that was normal.
[02:01:20.315 --> 02:01:27.579]  I mean, believe me, sir, if there's not mass raping and torturing people and drug dealing by the guards, you were in a wonderful facility.
[02:01:28.099 --> 02:01:28.779]  Absolutely.
[02:01:28.859 --> 02:01:29.500]  That's nothing.
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:32.221]  Michael Rivero, tell him how bad the jails are.
[02:01:32.717 --> 02:01:34.999]  Yeah, the jails are very bad in the U.S.
[02:01:35.019 --> 02:01:36.681]  You're not allowed to find out about it.
[02:01:37.301 --> 02:01:39.983]  There are all kinds of human rights violations going on.
[02:01:40.664 --> 02:01:43.607]  And, of course, the mainstream media very rarely reports it.
[02:01:44.568 --> 02:01:47.110]  But it's a very ugly situation in there.
[02:01:47.130 --> 02:01:50.353]  And I know there's a lot of people who said, well, they're criminals.
[02:01:50.613 --> 02:01:51.994]  Jails should be a place to suffer in.
[02:01:52.494 --> 02:01:57.519]  But when you temper that with what Alex was saying before, that a lot of the laws people are being put in jails for
[02:01:57.961 --> 02:02:06.445]  are really rather pointless, victimless crimes, procedural crimes, failure to obey some regulation or submit some kind of piece of paperwork.
[02:02:07.326 --> 02:02:09.507]  And it's really an ugly situation.
[02:02:09.607 --> 02:02:16.370]  And ultimately, I think where it's headed, because the system is a huge cash sink, that we're going to see an increase on this so-called...
[02:02:17.194 --> 02:02:21.055]  Prison labor industries, where the prisoners are jailed and put to work.
[02:02:21.155 --> 02:02:26.016]  Yeah, there are two million people in prison industries, and the idiots on the streets say, good, make them work.
[02:02:26.456 --> 02:02:28.377]  Hey, they're getting 20 cents an hour on average.
[02:02:28.397 --> 02:02:29.497]  That's taking your job.
[02:02:31.418 --> 02:02:33.498]  Yeah, it's pulling everybody's wages down.
[02:02:33.598 --> 02:02:34.438]  Hey, thanks, caller.
[02:02:34.478 --> 02:02:35.599]  Michael Lavera, we're out of time.
[02:02:35.639 --> 02:02:36.619]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[02:02:37.019 --> 02:02:37.939]  Talk to you next month.
[02:02:38.159 --> 02:02:38.559]  Take care.
[02:02:38.579 --> 02:02:40.140]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:40.620]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.564 --> 02:02:51.705]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.085 --> 02:02:53.985]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.385 --> 02:03:02.047]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.727 --> 02:03:09.768]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.169 --> 02:03:13.109]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.449 --> 02:03:15.810]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.230 --> 02:03:17.070]  NSA spies.
[02:03:17.626 --> 02:03:20.887]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[02:03:45.608 --> 02:03:49.171]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:03:49.231 --> 02:03:49.712]  are located?
[02:03:49.932 --> 02:03:53.315]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:03:53.535 --> 02:03:58.259]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[02:04:03.783 --> 02:04:04.363]  We're good to go.

[02:04:45.771 --> 02:04:48.193]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:48.713 --> 02:04:52.035]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:04:52.395 --> 02:04:55.337]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:04:55.617 --> 02:05:02.001]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:06.464]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:05:06.704 --> 02:05:11.066]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:05:11.227 --> 02:05:13.828]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:05:13.848 --> 02:05:16.629]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:05:17.090 --> 02:05:19.631]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:05:19.671 --> 02:05:23.913]  attack on Iran could result in China dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:05:23.973 --> 02:05:24.814]  Treasury bonds.
[02:05:25.094 --> 02:05:29.739]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:05:29.899 --> 02:05:31.541]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:31.561 --> 02:05:33.543]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:05:45.163 --> 02:05:52.909]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:02.536 --> 02:06:13.904]  Larry Patriarca is our guest, and then at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get into the world news, some of the news we haven't covered, and replay that clip from a new cable special, a drama.
[02:06:14.895 --> 02:06:18.996]  Sleeper cell where the terrorists joke about 9-11 Truth.
[02:06:19.096 --> 02:06:19.816]  Ha ha ha!
[02:06:20.236 --> 02:06:21.416]  The government did it!
[02:06:21.496 --> 02:06:22.176]  Ha ha ha!
[02:06:22.656 --> 02:06:26.077]  How ridiculous you see the terrorists are laughing at us.
[02:06:26.857 --> 02:06:28.677]  No, the terrorists, they really did it.
[02:06:30.518 --> 02:06:31.938]  Larry, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:06:32.158 --> 02:06:34.198]  There's going to be a big event.
[02:06:34.979 --> 02:06:38.439]  The Boston Tea Party for 9-11 Truth going viral.
[02:06:39.639 --> 02:06:42.900]  And we are honored to have you on with us
[02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:45.910]  First of all, Alex, it's a pleasure to join you.
[02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:46.450]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:07:13.232 --> 02:07:13.692]  No problem.
[02:07:14.393 --> 02:07:14.813]  My pleasure.
[02:07:16.635 --> 02:07:20.258]  Well, it's the anniversary of the actual Tea Party.
[02:07:20.278 --> 02:07:38.594]  The original Tea Party just gives us a great opportunity to try to wake up America to a modern-day similar situation where we're being oppressed, tyrannies rampant, and we have some truth to share with fellow Americans.
[02:07:40.522 --> 02:07:48.327]  We feel what we're doing is extremely patriotic compared to passive ignorance that's just rampant everywhere.
[02:07:49.708 --> 02:08:00.335]  People waving their flags, declaring themselves patriotic because they've got yellow stickers on the back, ribbon stickers on the back of their SUVs, and that's all it takes to be a patriot these days.
[02:08:01.645 --> 02:08:02.625]  Yeah, it's pretty easy.
[02:08:02.665 --> 02:08:05.286]  Let the firefighters and police breathe asbestos and die.
[02:08:05.306 --> 02:08:11.388]  Let the troops breathe DU, be in false wars, lose the Bill of Rights, have cameras put up nationwide, leave the borders wide open.
[02:08:11.688 --> 02:08:16.969]  As long as you can wave a plastic, desecrated flag made by slaves in China, everything's good.
[02:08:16.989 --> 02:08:24.031]  Oh yeah, and then of course we spend a trillion dollars on military spending this year alone, and that's all for our safety.
[02:08:24.511 --> 02:08:26.812]  Sorry, I just don't see the results of that money.
[02:08:28.267 --> 02:08:29.949]  You know, you just brought up a key point.
[02:08:29.969 --> 02:08:33.332]  The University of Texas has almost 40 million dollars
[02:08:47.779 --> 02:08:48.840]  In surplus funds.
[02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:49.980]  I just knew about one of the funds.
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:51.041]  I've learned of more now.
[02:08:51.481 --> 02:08:52.282]  Total cream.
[02:08:52.942 --> 02:08:53.823]  Not investments.
[02:08:53.923 --> 02:08:55.684]  Not pension funds.
[02:08:55.764 --> 02:08:57.505]  These are just liquid cash accounts.
[02:08:58.065 --> 02:09:06.671]  But they're going to raise tuition again from a college that in the past was totally free to the people of Texas who paid taxes for it if you had above a B+.
[02:09:07.311 --> 02:09:08.312]  And not now.
[02:09:08.892 --> 02:09:09.372]  Not now.
[02:09:09.953 --> 02:09:10.413]  Sorry.
[02:09:10.433 --> 02:09:11.614]  No, no, no.
[02:09:11.654 --> 02:09:13.115]  They've got to jack up the prices again.
[02:09:13.135 --> 02:09:14.275]  It is a raping.
[02:09:14.516 --> 02:09:16.857]  Just another example of how we're being scammed.
[02:09:17.684 --> 02:09:18.125]  Exactly.
[02:09:18.707 --> 02:09:19.871]  And it's education.
[02:09:21.396 --> 02:09:24.285]  I see it all as part of a master agenda for dumbing down America.
[02:09:25.587 --> 02:09:26.768]  Oh, that's their stated agenda.
[02:09:27.008 --> 02:09:33.974]  Tell us when you're going to have the rally, what it's going to consist of, some of the other areas of the country that are going to be having it, and how we can learn more about it on 9-11 Blogger.
[02:09:34.515 --> 02:09:38.518]  We have a link up on Infowars.com, the subpages that detail it.
[02:09:38.738 --> 02:09:42.641]  Tell us what you're going to do, and then what you're going to say to the press if they do arrive to cover it.
[02:09:43.402 --> 02:09:44.683]  This is the tough thing.
[02:09:44.783 --> 02:09:49.367]  This was an undecisive thing for us as far as how much to reveal in a press release.
[02:09:50.927 --> 02:10:06.012]  You know, we felt as soon as you start pointing a finger at the government, they did it, they did it, you know, your natural-born skeptics are all wearing press badges and, you know, it's going to make it tough to get them to show and not show just for the point of making fun of us.
[02:10:07.792 --> 02:10:12.534]  So, you know, the introductory message is going to involve...
[02:10:13.914 --> 02:10:24.806]  You know, spelling out what it means to be an American, what it means to be a patriot, and that we are here to support and defend the Constitution and American citizens, not a renegade government.
[02:10:27.048 --> 02:10:34.276]  And the guest speakers, one by one, will give their message, and some of it may include my hop and my hop, and
[02:10:35.191 --> 02:10:40.033]  But the general message will be that, you know, we're making a stand.
[02:10:40.053 --> 02:10:41.134]  We're tired of being lied to.
[02:10:41.174 --> 02:10:45.575]  The commission report is an obvious cover-up and a 571-page lie.
[02:10:45.715 --> 02:10:46.016]  It is.
[02:10:46.116 --> 02:10:47.596]  It's been analyzed by scholars.
[02:10:47.816 --> 02:10:49.417]  Everything is a huge lie.
[02:10:50.083 --> 02:10:51.184]  They don't even mention Building 7.
[02:10:51.524 --> 02:10:54.025]  They claim there were no big steel columns in Tower 1 or 2.
[02:10:54.725 --> 02:11:00.427]  I mean, they don't mention, you know, that the money came from ISI slash MI6.
[02:11:00.628 --> 02:11:02.488]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:11:02.668 --> 02:11:03.849]  Oh, the list goes on and on.
[02:11:03.909 --> 02:11:15.334]  I mean, just try and piece together what they determined, you know, the minute-by-minute results of September 11th were, and it's 50 pages of fluff and maybe...
[02:11:15.874 --> 02:11:20.181]  Maybe one full page of text that actually pertains to minute-by-minute account of the day.
[02:11:20.642 --> 02:11:25.130]  The rest of it, you know, just that one chapter of September 11th just talks about the heroism of the day.
[02:11:25.854 --> 02:11:28.855]  You know, and yeah, we all support that, but excuse me, that's a distraction.
[02:11:28.915 --> 02:11:32.297]  I want to hear you tell me what time the terrorists got on the planes.
[02:11:32.357 --> 02:11:34.037]  What time, how did they get on the planes?
[02:11:34.057 --> 02:11:42.961]  And we also caught the report lying against admitted, published Pentagon and FAA and NORAD with dates.
[02:11:43.001 --> 02:11:44.642]  We have them also cooking the numbers.
[02:11:44.842 --> 02:11:47.863]  Right, and everybody's report conflicts with everybody else's, but yet.
[02:11:48.365 --> 02:11:51.246]  You know, that isn't pointed out in the book.
[02:11:51.747 --> 02:11:58.710]  So we know it's just all a cover-up, and it basically blames nobody, incriminates nobody for anything, regardless of liha, miha.
[02:11:58.770 --> 02:12:01.652]  But then calls for a huge police state in America.
[02:12:02.572 --> 02:12:02.952]  Of course.
[02:12:03.512 --> 02:12:05.233]  That's the only way to protect us from within.
[02:12:05.353 --> 02:12:10.596]  You know, take away our rights, and take away the rights of Muslims.
[02:12:11.495 --> 02:12:12.376]  To protect us.
[02:12:12.596 --> 02:12:19.659]  And, you know, the complacent sheep in this country fail to realize that if you read between the lines, it doesn't say just Muslims or terrorists.
[02:12:19.699 --> 02:12:22.960]  It may say that here and there in the Patriot Act and the Military Extermination Act.
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:27.602]  But, you know, you read through it enough and you'll find where it says all citizens.
[02:12:28.157 --> 02:12:33.222]  You know, so we are not exempt from these laws that are supposed to protect us.
[02:12:34.303 --> 02:12:36.825]  They are laws to be held against us.
[02:12:36.845 --> 02:12:41.709]  Well, it's like Hitler at first said, oh, I'm just taking the Communists and the Jews' rights, but really he took everybody's.
[02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:43.291]  Exactly.
[02:12:43.631 --> 02:12:51.518]  And that's the naivety of those waving the flag, you know, standing up to the soldiers and yelling, go get them, boys, but, you know.
[02:12:52.542 --> 02:12:57.324]  It usually, it mostly isn't the people that are sending their sons and daughters over, it's the people down the street.
[02:12:57.525 --> 02:13:01.606]  Well, what do they think America is if it isn't the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[02:13:01.646 --> 02:13:02.827]  I mean, that's being scrapped.
[02:13:02.847 --> 02:13:09.170]  The very group launching the war, the very group that carried out the attacks, is the very group getting rid of our borders and our sovereignty.
[02:13:09.210 --> 02:13:11.491]  I mean, two plus two equals four, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:13:11.811 --> 02:13:11.951]  Yep.
[02:13:12.431 --> 02:13:14.212]  Well, it's the propaganda machine at work.
[02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:17.994]  You know, everybody just, you know, has been brainwashed since we were kids that, you know,
[02:13:18.856 --> 02:13:25.177]  They've blurred the difference between American America, its Constitution, its citizens, and its government.
[02:13:26.598 --> 02:13:31.979]  You know, I had a vet say to me, you know, for country, right or wrong?
[02:13:31.999 --> 02:13:35.340]  I'm like, bull, what about for family and American citizens?
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:36.860]  And do the right thing.
[02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:44.962]  You know, even Teddy Roosevelt, you know, claimed that to follow a president right or wrong was not only...
[02:13:48.913 --> 02:13:55.597]  Well, I mean, the folks that say you serve the government, I see this, oh, I'm a good, I've been loyal to the government.
[02:13:56.118 --> 02:13:58.739]  I hear politicians, FBI agents, cops say this.
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:01.541]  The Founding Fathers said the exact opposite.
[02:14:01.561 --> 02:14:10.127]  You're loyal to the people, and the Bill of Rights and Constitution restricts the government that is always deadly dangerous to your life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[02:14:10.787 --> 02:14:12.268]  And, in fact, did you ever cue that up?
[02:14:12.328 --> 02:14:13.409]  I know that was in the first hour.
[02:14:13.469 --> 02:14:14.430]  John, do you have that clip?
[02:14:14.930 --> 02:14:16.831]  This morning with Jefferson regarding a Shea uprising.
[02:14:37.998 --> 02:14:42.561]  In 1786, you know, others wanted them all executed.
[02:14:43.742 --> 02:14:47.605]  And Jefferson stated, well, a little uprising now and then is a good thing.
[02:14:48.065 --> 02:14:49.866]  Or a little rebellion now and then is a good thing.
[02:14:51.067 --> 02:14:53.468]  And, you know, a healthy country needs it every 20 years.
[02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:56.911]  Or you get rampant corruption.
[02:14:57.751 --> 02:15:00.773]  Those with the power will take advantage of it and run with it.
[02:15:00.993 --> 02:15:06.037]  And that's what's happened to us, I believe, since, you know, long before the Federal Reserve Act.
[02:15:07.248 --> 02:15:10.751]  Here's an example of the register.
[02:15:10.771 --> 02:15:18.960]  A big technology newspaper reported yesterday that the thing that would destroy internet neutrality and basically kill the freedom on the net was defeated.
[02:15:29.039 --> 02:15:39.085]  But the telecommunications company spent $150 million this year lobbying for it.
[02:15:39.105 --> 02:15:43.228]  $150 million lobbying Congress alone.
[02:15:44.508 --> 02:15:45.609]  I mean, that is incredible.
[02:15:46.309 --> 02:15:48.351]  Yeah, and this is why it's such a tough battle for us.
[02:15:49.099 --> 02:15:54.323]  You know, even with the Boston Tea Party, I mean, you know, we don't have a big bankroll flipping the bill on this.
[02:15:54.363 --> 02:15:56.085]  You know, it's all out of pocket and donations.
[02:15:56.125 --> 02:15:58.106]  Tell folks where they meet, how they get involved.
[02:15:58.126 --> 02:15:59.167]  Tell us about it.
[02:15:59.207 --> 02:16:08.935]  The actual event will commence at 11.30 outside Faneuil Hall between Quincy Market and Faneuil Hall, between the entrances of each.
[02:16:10.557 --> 02:16:11.658]  Commences, kicks off at 11.30 a.m.
[02:16:11.758 --> 02:16:12.138]  on Saturday.
[02:16:15.234 --> 02:16:16.835]  By 1 p.m.
[02:16:16.915 --> 02:16:25.244]  after a few guest speakers including Barbara Honiger and Dr. Bob Bowman will speak and a few others.
[02:16:25.925 --> 02:16:36.876]  Then we commence with a parade down to the Boston Harbor and another session and round of speeches and press conference and then we will
[02:16:37.803 --> 02:16:39.205]  And I see that on 9-1-1 Blogger.
[02:16:55.289 --> 02:17:01.033]  Some people are worried about, well, we can't go throwing trash in the river, or we can't go throwing trash in that lake.
[02:17:01.153 --> 02:17:01.993]  Oh, give me a break.
[02:17:02.033 --> 02:17:07.497]  The government dumped 3 million gallons of nerve gas right near that harbor just a few years ago.
[02:17:07.577 --> 02:17:11.559]  I say dress up like Indians and throw them in there.
[02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:13.380]  Let them arrest you.
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:15.122]  That'll get more attention.
[02:17:15.202 --> 02:17:17.983]  Somebody asked on Blogger, well, why did they dress up like Indians?
[02:17:18.083 --> 02:17:20.625]  It was to hide their identity.
[02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:22.086]  They boarded ships.
[02:17:22.586 --> 02:17:25.228]  They couldn't dress up as colonials, obviously.
[02:17:25.749 --> 02:17:27.630]  Yeah, of course, it was disguises.
[02:17:27.650 --> 02:17:34.576]  They had paint on their faces because they went on ships in the docks and destroyed the equivalent of $50 million worth of product.
[02:17:35.437 --> 02:17:42.903]  And we'll be right back.
[02:17:43.183 --> 02:17:50.449]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:52.739 --> 02:17:57.562]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:57.762 --> 02:18:00.504]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:00.544 --> 02:18:01.665]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:03.006 --> 02:18:07.608]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:08.529 --> 02:18:15.794]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:18:16.794 --> 02:18:19.856]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:18:21.986 --> 02:18:25.448]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:18:26.428 --> 02:18:27.709]  Call for your copy today.
[02:18:27.949 --> 02:18:30.170]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:31.211 --> 02:18:37.073]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:18:37.754 --> 02:18:38.174]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:38.194 --> 02:18:38.414]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:47.256 --> 02:18:48.297]  The war on terrorism.
[02:18:48.617 --> 02:18:51.399]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:55.823]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.263 --> 02:18:57.124]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.404 --> 02:19:01.968]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:02.455 --> 02:19:04.576]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:19:05.076 --> 02:19:19.763]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:19.803 --> 02:19:26.947]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:19:40.614 --> 02:19:43.375]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:48.398]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[02:19:49.058 --> 02:19:55.702]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:19:56.883 --> 02:19:59.084]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:59.961 --> 02:20:00.562]  We're good to go.
[02:20:00.582 --> 02:20:01.162]  We're good to go.
[02:20:28.487 --> 02:20:29.147]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:45.308 --> 02:20:47.609]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:20:47.689 --> 02:20:50.010]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:54.592]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:20:55.193 --> 02:21:01.656]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:21:02.176 --> 02:21:14.282]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:21:14.822 --> 02:21:18.624]  WristEase is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.

[02:21:35.174 --> 02:21:41.458]  That's WristEase, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, WristEase.com.
[02:21:41.598 --> 02:21:44.100]  Once again, WristEase.com.
[02:21:54.188 --> 02:21:54.809]  In a bloody war.
[02:21:54.829 --> 02:21:55.929]  Liberty for their descendants.
[02:21:55.969 --> 02:22:01.794]  Now, when I mention nerve gas, let me give you the background.
[02:22:01.814 --> 02:22:08.758]  A year and a half ago in the Delaware River,
[02:22:24.674 --> 02:22:31.397]  They released tens of millions of gallons of diluted nerve gas, and it killed everything in the river.
[02:22:31.977 --> 02:22:33.978]  That was in the news, just, oh, we're dumping nerve gas.
[02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:45.003]  And a few years before that, they dumped millions of gallons of pure nerve gas off of the East Coast at three different spots.
[02:22:45.903 --> 02:22:52.146]  So here's the government just out dumping solid nerve gas into the ocean you're going to be eating fish and lobsters out of and crabs.
[02:22:53.852 --> 02:22:56.973]  But oh my gosh, don't you dare throw some books in the harbor.
[02:22:57.854 --> 02:22:59.234]  See, it's all these laws for us.
[02:22:59.595 --> 02:23:02.636]  No laws, or no following laws for them.
[02:23:02.656 --> 02:23:03.996]  Can you imagine?
[02:23:04.317 --> 02:23:05.237]  I'm not knocking you guys.
[02:23:05.257 --> 02:23:07.698]  Going out and speaking out about 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:23:07.718 --> 02:23:10.099]  We're talking about government involvement.
[02:23:10.139 --> 02:23:10.599]  That's great.
[02:23:10.639 --> 02:23:11.220]  It's good to get out.
[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:15.401]  But I can just see this with the... The cops will probably tell you not even to do that.
[02:23:15.421 --> 02:23:19.003]  They'll probably say a rope tied to a book is an Al-Qaeda weapon.
[02:23:19.924 --> 02:23:22.645]  I mean, is it an authorized demonstration?
[02:23:22.705 --> 02:23:23.786]  Did you get your permit?
[02:23:24.446 --> 02:23:26.227]  Yeah, we actually did, but you're right.
[02:23:26.247 --> 02:23:32.790]  They may look for a reason to disrupt it, you know, and they may not even need a legal or valid reason to disrupt it.
[02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:35.411]  But that's the land of the free, home of the brave.
[02:23:35.451 --> 02:23:37.052]  I'm glad you got your permit.
[02:23:37.705 --> 02:23:37.885]  Yes.
[02:23:38.265 --> 02:23:54.333]  I mean, imagine how far we've come to a bunch of drunk Founding Fathers spilling out of the tavern, dressed up like Indians, savaging up in giant cases of tea, and climbing on board ships for hours, dumping whole loads of tea into Boston Harbor.
[02:23:54.553 --> 02:23:56.153]  I'm not knocking you, sir.
[02:23:56.213 --> 02:23:58.154]  I'm just illustrating what we are today.
[02:23:58.614 --> 02:24:06.018]  We've got our permits, and we're not going to let them touch the water, and we're going to... You know, your black ski mask is so handsome, and I please...
[02:24:07.887 --> 02:24:16.790]  So obviously you're assuming that it doesn't matter how careful we are about how we proceed with this.
[02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:21.152]  No, no, I think what you're doing is... No, no, listen, I've been part of permanent protest.
[02:24:21.172 --> 02:24:22.292]  I'm not knocking you.
[02:24:22.872 --> 02:24:25.433]  I'm illustrating that we're both gelded, that's all.
[02:24:25.773 --> 02:24:25.953]  Right.
[02:24:26.173 --> 02:24:29.574]  I mean, I like to admit the pathetic slave I am here on air.
[02:24:30.095 --> 02:24:33.796]  You know, I say on air that the country is gone.
[02:24:35.196 --> 02:24:36.857]  I say on air the country is gone.
[02:24:37.415 --> 02:24:38.696]  And I'm not being negative there.
[02:24:38.936 --> 02:24:44.600]  We have to admit how bad it is and admit how far we've slid to then set about getting it back.
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:45.380]  Right.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:46.581]  Do you see my point?
[02:24:46.921 --> 02:24:47.521]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:24:48.462 --> 02:24:48.902]  Absolutely.
[02:24:49.363 --> 02:24:55.446]  It's amazing how many people fail to realize how destroyed this country is right now.
[02:24:56.127 --> 02:24:59.569]  How it is not the America that is portrayed to us.
[02:24:59.589 --> 02:25:00.430]  We're not as free...
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:05.561]  As we think we are.
[02:25:05.641 --> 02:25:07.923]  We're not as liberal as we think we are.
[02:25:08.363 --> 02:25:09.944]  We have very few rights.
[02:25:09.964 --> 02:25:15.929]  The only rights you have are the ones that agree with their agenda or what they say is okay.
[02:25:16.149 --> 02:25:19.511]  The only reason we have Indian rights left is because they know we're armed.
[02:25:20.532 --> 02:25:22.433]  And not much longer.
[02:25:22.934 --> 02:25:23.334]  Exactly.
[02:25:23.394 --> 02:25:25.296]  I don't like Mao Zedong, but what he said was true.
[02:25:25.796 --> 02:25:28.278]  All political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
[02:25:30.129 --> 02:25:32.030]  And they'd like to be violent, we're not violent.
[02:25:32.050 --> 02:25:33.610]  Well, I wish I could be there with you.
[02:25:34.090 --> 02:25:36.011]  Is there a particular website you'd like to plug?
[02:25:36.031 --> 02:25:42.934]  Yeah, let's see, Boston, www.boston911truth.org.
[02:25:44.534 --> 02:25:53.337]  We're getting so much response from people, oh, thanks for doing this, we wish we could be there, and certainly we encourage others to have their own events in their area.
[02:25:53.417 --> 02:25:57.739]  I mean, we envision this being, you know, just like the Boston Tea Party has been a yearly tradition for 200 years,
[02:25:59.244 --> 02:26:01.566]  We can see this being some kind of a yearly tradition.
[02:26:01.686 --> 02:26:05.590]  Oh, does the city allow the devil tea to touch the water?
[02:26:06.431 --> 02:26:08.813]  Well, we'll see, won't we?
[02:26:10.175 --> 02:26:14.820]  No, but I mean, you know, the yearly reenactment there in Boston, they do throw tea in.
[02:26:16.293 --> 02:26:18.594]  I don't know if they actually go that far.
[02:26:18.694 --> 02:26:21.176]  It's the environment.
[02:26:21.456 --> 02:26:27.560]  Fortunately for us, there is no actual Boston Tea Party reenactment this year, so there's no conflict with another group trying to do it.
[02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:29.181]  I had just read about that in the past.
[02:26:29.221 --> 02:26:30.802]  I guess we don't do that anymore in America either.
[02:26:31.122 --> 02:26:35.604]  Now, San Francisco, and I'm told they're doing it also somewhere in Missouri.
[02:26:35.705 --> 02:26:37.246]  Philadelphia, St.
[02:26:37.306 --> 02:26:37.646]  Louis.
[02:26:38.226 --> 02:26:44.090]  Milwaukee, San Francisco are the four or five that I know of so far.
[02:26:44.210 --> 02:26:50.373]  So folks, just search 9-11 Truth in those cities and check out, what's the Boston website again?
[02:26:51.134 --> 02:27:00.780]  Boston911truth.org and for anybody that would love to go and can't, we have a donations button and any help would be very grateful for us.
[02:27:01.459 --> 02:27:06.003]  It helps us out with the cost for the speakers and the event.
[02:27:06.123 --> 02:27:08.085]  How many people do you think you're going to have there?
[02:27:08.545 --> 02:27:12.068]  Oh, man, it is so hard to tell.
[02:27:12.088 --> 02:27:13.889]  It could be anywhere from 200 to 2,000.
[02:27:13.970 --> 02:27:15.611]  We just can't really tell.
[02:27:16.011 --> 02:27:18.734]  Yeah, I bet you're going to have about 800 people, and that's going to be great.
[02:27:18.994 --> 02:27:21.196]  Everybody needs to call the press in those cities in demand.
[02:27:21.236 --> 02:27:22.096]  They show up and cover it.
[02:27:22.317 --> 02:27:26.640]  Hey, I appreciate you coming on, Larry, and I hope you'll send us some video of it so we can put it out on the web.
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:27.561]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:27:27.581 --> 02:27:28.362]  Thanks for the invite.
[02:27:28.542 --> 02:27:29.843]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:27:30.683 --> 02:27:36.828]  Alright, we'll come back, get some phone calls, cover some news, talk about some new developments with the London bombings, you name it.
[02:27:37.328 --> 02:27:38.949]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:42.532]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.084 --> 02:27:50.066]  I found this company online, and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:27:50.286 --> 02:27:53.808]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:27:54.108 --> 02:27:58.189]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:27:58.470 --> 02:27:59.410]  I was so amazed.
[02:27:59.650 --> 02:28:02.511]  I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect nightlight.
[02:28:02.672 --> 02:28:04.552]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:28:04.953 --> 02:28:10.135]  SolelyWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:16.521]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:28:16.801 --> 02:28:18.523]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:28:18.783 --> 02:28:21.946]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:28:22.146 --> 02:28:26.050]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:28:26.310 --> 02:28:27.772]  Plus, the service was great.
[02:28:28.112 --> 02:28:33.254]  If you're interested in natural, homeopathic, time-tested remedies, visit SolayWellness.com.
[02:28:33.294 --> 02:28:36.435]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness.com.
[02:28:36.615 --> 02:28:37.075]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[02:28:37.095 --> 02:28:37.135]  312-224-2710.
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:47.561]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:28:47.881 --> 02:28:49.422]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:28:49.822 --> 02:28:50.082]  What?
[02:28:50.442 --> 02:28:50.802]  Again?
[02:28:51.222 --> 02:28:52.843]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:28:52.923 --> 02:28:57.345]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[02:28:57.565 --> 02:28:58.866]  Why did you do that?
[02:28:59.066 --> 02:29:04.868]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:29:05.168 --> 02:29:06.189]  Are we there yet?
[02:29:06.289 --> 02:29:07.369]  for the entire trip.
[02:29:07.609 --> 02:29:09.810]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:29:10.290 --> 02:29:11.291]  Great idea.
[02:29:11.311 --> 02:29:14.172]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:29:14.532 --> 02:29:21.597]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:29:21.878 --> 02:29:22.178]  Honey?
[02:29:23.004 --> 02:29:24.245]  You're terrific!
[02:29:24.645 --> 02:29:26.125]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:29:26.245 --> 02:29:29.647]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:29:29.927 --> 02:29:30.728]  Now can we stop?
[02:29:31.228 --> 02:29:31.948]  I need to go, too.
[02:29:32.248 --> 02:29:36.690]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:45.487 --> 02:29:47.068]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:55.996]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:29:56.356 --> 02:30:02.081]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:30:02.481 --> 02:30:09.906]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[02:30:10.246 --> 02:30:15.609]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.

[02:30:26.636 --> 02:30:29.380]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?

[02:31:00.171 --> 02:31:00.751]  We're good.
[02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:28.162]  God, it ain't mean, it ain't mean love, I ain't no sinner that's done.
[02:31:28.262 --> 02:31:35.023]  It ain't mean love, it ain't mean, I ain't some fortune that's won.
[02:31:35.104 --> 02:31:38.604]  Some folks are born to wish food in their hands.
[02:31:45.646 --> 02:31:46.187]  We're good.
[02:32:23.598 --> 02:32:27.261]  Welcome back.
[02:32:27.441 --> 02:32:29.163]  Glad that you were able to join us.
[02:32:30.544 --> 02:32:37.930]  There's a big, complex story up on Infowars.net, up on PrisonPlanet.com, now in yesterday's news.
[02:32:38.170 --> 02:32:40.392]  And I really wanted to get Steve or Paul on.
[02:32:41.753 --> 02:32:46.515]  To break this down, and we're even working on getting the individual himself on.
[02:32:47.116 --> 02:32:55.099]  And this fits in with the press reports, some of the other bus employees, bus company employees we've talked to, local witnesses who we talked to.
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.220]  They're at the site of the bombing.
[02:32:57.240 --> 02:32:58.921]  Remember, there were three trains that got bombed.
[02:32:59.361 --> 02:33:07.365]  And then an hour later, right at an hour later, what, 58, 59 minutes later, the bus blows up.
[02:33:07.865 --> 02:33:09.826]  Now, they took the bus by itself,
[02:33:10.789 --> 02:33:13.870]  And directed it off its route and drove it to this point.
[02:33:16.030 --> 02:33:27.532]  And then they were listening to the radio on the bus and were talking about bombs and backpacks and a man then got agitated and sort of looking like he didn't know what was in it and then it went off.
[02:33:29.252 --> 02:33:35.373]  And eyewitnesses reported he was on the bus and the picture of his bloody shirt, what he did, what the police said to him.
[02:33:36.794 --> 02:33:37.894]  And the bus...
[02:33:39.295 --> 02:33:44.979]  Was directed by two black unmarked cars that got in front and back of it and told to go there.
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:52.925]  It looks like bombs in the backpack didn't go off by remote control, that these guys were all couriers.
[02:33:53.732 --> 02:33:55.433]  This is even what Scotland Yard said.
[02:33:55.453 --> 02:33:56.693]  This isn't me saying this.
[02:33:57.253 --> 02:34:22.180]  Scotland Yard, their head detective, who obviously wasn't part of the conspiracy, said, listen, we've looked at the MO on this, and from everything we've seen, eyewitnesses, reports, arguing about ticket prices, laughing, playing cricket the night before, these guys' backgrounds, it looks like they were some type of couriers hired to carry these backpacks, or didn't know what was in the backpacks.
[02:34:22.791 --> 02:34:28.735]  And then the evidence, the bombs on the trains were simultaneous, within seconds of each other.
[02:34:29.495 --> 02:34:30.716]  But then something didn't go right.
[02:34:30.736 --> 02:34:35.479]  They didn't want it announced, so the police were told, lock it down, claim it's a power surge.
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:40.823]  But then after an hour, it started leaking out that, no, there's been big bombs that have gone off.
[02:34:42.084 --> 02:34:44.065]  Just from people coming in and out of the underground.
[02:34:45.025 --> 02:34:49.709]  And so this bus gets directed to a site right there in Tavistock Square.
[02:34:49.769 --> 02:34:50.269]  I've been there.
[02:34:51.215 --> 02:34:52.717]  We're good to go.
[02:34:52.737 --> 02:34:53.677]  We're good to go.
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:25.307]  Then with the trains, a bunch of eyewitnesses said that they didn't see rucksacks go off, that they were all just sitting there and suddenly the bottom of the train blew up.
[02:35:25.847 --> 02:35:31.551]  And then eyewitnesses, police and others, said that it showed the metal sticking up through the floor.
[02:35:32.752 --> 02:35:34.413]  And that was in multiple newspapers.
[02:35:35.173 --> 02:35:40.877]  And of course, so they put blue tarps all around it and took the carriages out under guard, wouldn't let anybody look at the damage.
[02:35:43.539 --> 02:35:44.720]  You have to ask yourselves why.
[02:35:46.101 --> 02:35:47.462]  And then it goes into all the other evidence.
[02:35:47.482 --> 02:35:57.189]  The government had paid for a drill that morning of the exact same trains at the exact same time at the exact same locations.
[02:35:57.889 --> 02:36:02.012]  That is one in multi-tractogillion.
[02:36:03.313 --> 02:36:06.175]  And we go through all that in the film.
[02:36:06.335 --> 02:36:07.436]  It has 43 zeros on it.
[02:36:09.177 --> 02:36:13.139]  That's many times all the... It's billions and billions and billions and still billions.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:15.101]  More time...
[02:36:15.828 --> 02:36:26.955]  More times, more... I've been asking for months for somebody to get me a phone without a ringer, and I've got two phones here, and they both don't have ringers, so I have to unplug the studio phone.
[02:36:26.975 --> 02:36:28.036]  I'll probably never have one.
[02:36:28.056 --> 02:36:29.637]  If I want one, I've got to go down and get one myself.
[02:36:31.538 --> 02:36:32.178]  Sorry about that.
[02:36:32.518 --> 02:36:34.079]  Now I've lost my train of thought there.
[02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:39.963]  It's probably annoying Russian media.
[02:36:40.183 --> 02:36:41.464]  I have this little office phone in here.
[02:36:42.310 --> 02:36:46.591]  And I told this Russian media TV station that keeps calling me, don't call this phone number.
[02:36:46.651 --> 02:36:49.372]  And they just call it every day, multiple times daily.
[02:36:50.473 --> 02:36:51.253]  Very annoying.
[02:36:51.273 --> 02:36:55.314]  I just have to have some little private phone I can use, you know, in my own office.
[02:36:55.334 --> 02:36:58.515]  All right, that's enough.
[02:36:59.335 --> 02:37:01.276]  What was I talking about just now?
[02:37:04.717 --> 02:37:07.218]  There's one downside of starting to exercise a lot more.
[02:37:08.470 --> 02:37:13.151]  Back when I used to jog every day and lift weights every day, I was a lot more aggressive, higher testosterone level.
[02:37:13.772 --> 02:37:17.193]  And now I've been jogging again and lifting weights and biking a lot.
[02:37:18.333 --> 02:37:26.455]  And I am having the old feelings of wanting to smash things, wanting to overturn things, wanting to... Usually somebody flips me off driving down the highway.
[02:37:26.515 --> 02:37:26.995]  I don't care.
[02:37:27.956 --> 02:37:29.296]  My eye's bugging out again.
[02:37:29.316 --> 02:37:30.336]  I've got to control myself.
[02:37:30.356 --> 02:37:32.117]  I almost smashed this phone.
[02:37:34.998 --> 02:37:35.458]  Anyways...
[02:37:38.286 --> 02:37:55.099]  So, we, yes, we have drills being run of the exact same target at the exact same times, at the exact same location being bombed.
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:56.480]  That's impossible.
[02:37:57.461 --> 02:38:03.446]  And, of course, we have the exact same targets, exact same places, exact same time.
[02:38:05.342 --> 02:38:10.726]  On the same date, everything, that's really being hit in real life, in real time on 9-11.
[02:38:11.607 --> 02:38:19.413]  And we told you that almost two years before it was in USA Today, Associated Press, Newsweek, when they broke the big story for you.
[02:38:23.476 --> 02:38:26.959]  So, this is how they operate.
[02:38:30.949 --> 02:38:33.690]  And there's about 150 other examples plus on 7-7.
[02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:36.150]  That's why I made the film Terror Storm.
[02:38:36.190 --> 02:38:37.251]  And now let me digress.
[02:38:37.751 --> 02:38:45.933]  You can go read this article, the headline, 7-7 witness bus was diverted to Tavistock Square by two unmarked cars.
[02:38:46.733 --> 02:38:52.654]  Soon to be published account will detail the plot and cover-up of the number 30 bus bombing.
[02:38:54.075 --> 02:39:00.136]  And then it goes into a lengthy report on that
[02:39:02.529 --> 02:39:07.994]  And it fits in with all the information that we have as well.
[02:39:08.994 --> 02:39:16.901]  So, I would ask listeners, this is an important broadcast.
[02:39:17.041 --> 02:39:19.003]  We're fighting for the republic.
[02:39:20.104 --> 02:39:24.767]  This is life and death for the country, and the sovereignty and the liberty we have all enjoyed.
[02:39:25.608 --> 02:39:26.809]  And things are very dark.
[02:39:26.849 --> 02:39:31.213]  We're very down, far down the rat hole of the New World Order right now.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.740]  Things have gotten very, very serious.
[02:39:34.521 --> 02:39:36.641]  The good news is people are waking up in droves.
[02:39:36.681 --> 02:39:38.461]  There is a huge awakening taking place.
[02:39:39.842 --> 02:39:46.263]  But I still don't think most people realize how late it is and that officially we're in the North American Union.
[02:39:46.703 --> 02:39:48.504]  Officially they've already dissolved the borders.
[02:39:48.984 --> 02:39:54.585]  Officially they're legalizing all the illegal aliens and ordering all the banks to give them bank accounts with no ID.
[02:39:54.645 --> 02:39:55.345]  That is so key.
[02:39:57.246 --> 02:39:59.186]  I mean, you educate the public on that, they will get mad.
[02:39:59.918 --> 02:40:08.760]  We've got to give up all our rights and be treated like slaves and go through checkpoints and be minded by the police like they're our nannies, ninnying after us with their nightsticks.
[02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:11.680]  Put the borders wide open.
[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:17.021]  And we need to address just how bad a shape the country's in.
[02:40:18.542 --> 02:40:20.602]  The final stages of total dismantling.
[02:40:21.782 --> 02:40:23.363]  To then set about fixing it.
[02:40:24.663 --> 02:40:25.443]  You know, if you've got...
[02:40:27.668 --> 02:40:28.328]  We're good to go.
[02:40:28.368 --> 02:40:28.969]  We're good to go.
[02:40:46.132 --> 02:40:49.133]  The federal agencies are merging with Canadian and Mexican agencies.
[02:40:49.833 --> 02:41:07.399]  Foreign companies and countries are taking into receivership the countries being carved up and handed over to different IMF and World Bank crime syndicate components, nodules, modes, nodes.
[02:41:08.299 --> 02:41:10.620]  I guess the best term would be just components.
[02:41:13.621 --> 02:41:13.761]  And
[02:41:15.265 --> 02:41:15.886]  I don't like it.
[02:41:16.946 --> 02:41:20.089]  And I'm here to try to warn people in my own shoddy way.
[02:41:21.250 --> 02:41:22.271]  I don't claim to be perfect.
[02:41:24.933 --> 02:41:33.259]  People expect me to have all the answers and put it all just perfectly and do all the work and step and fetch it for them and plug this, plug that.
[02:41:35.481 --> 02:41:36.322]  I haven't done enough.
[02:41:36.442 --> 02:41:37.383]  I'm not good.
[02:41:38.003 --> 02:41:39.645]  I need to cover this on the show.
[02:41:40.986 --> 02:41:43.808]  And I just want them to walk a mile in my shoes, something they can never do.
[02:41:44.674 --> 02:41:45.134]  Obviously.
[02:41:46.575 --> 02:41:52.177]  But I know there's millions of you out there that do care and do know how far things have gone.
[02:41:53.578 --> 02:41:58.981]  And a year, two years, three years in the scale of humanity is just a few seconds.
[02:42:02.542 --> 02:42:06.604]  And just because they have killed the country, they did it artificially.
[02:42:06.804 --> 02:42:10.146]  They basically electrocuted the nation and knocked our heart off.
[02:42:11.386 --> 02:42:13.287]  And so I'm saying we can defibrillate.
[02:42:14.429 --> 02:42:20.654]  We can do resuscitation here, but you have to stop putting perfume on the dead body.
[02:42:20.714 --> 02:42:23.536]  You have to stop eating around the edges.
[02:42:24.837 --> 02:42:34.445]  We need to fully recognize... I mean, people are just now figuring out that there's a plan for a North American Union when we're already in it.
[02:42:37.611 --> 02:42:41.772]  You see, back when they were setting it up, people couldn't believe it.
[02:42:41.812 --> 02:42:45.533]  Now that we're in it, they're just now thinking that they're trying to set it up.
[02:42:46.613 --> 02:42:48.194]  See, we don't have time for that.
[02:42:48.754 --> 02:43:00.397]  It's like if your house is on fire, you've got time to get out, but none of you sit there and assess it for five minutes, or none of you try to get your belongings out or save the goldfish.
[02:43:01.117 --> 02:43:02.658]  No, get out of the house.
[02:43:04.429 --> 02:43:07.252]  We don't have time to sit here and play games.
[02:43:09.454 --> 02:43:19.443]  We have to assess for ourselves and then admit to ourselves just how bleak and how dark and how bad things really are.
[02:43:19.483 --> 02:43:23.487]  I mean, yeah, you see people waking up and being more receptive now because we're so deep in it.
[02:43:24.067 --> 02:43:25.929]  Frankly, there should be a lot more people waking up
[02:43:26.781 --> 02:43:34.706]  Folks should be running around in the streets protesting, freaking out everywhere, suing every government you can, calling into talk radio, all the propaganda, writing into the newspaper.
[02:43:35.186 --> 02:43:37.307]  It's just laced propaganda everywhere.
[02:43:38.268 --> 02:43:40.149]  People should be outraged.
[02:43:40.209 --> 02:43:42.951]  And I know you are, but I mean to a higher level.
[02:43:47.458 --> 02:43:58.204]  I'm asking you, the listeners, if you are on the Internet, to email your entire email list with a nice little note saying, Hey, tune in to Alex Jones Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central and Sundays 4 to 6.
[02:43:58.864 --> 02:44:04.467]  Or go subscribe to the free podcast, which, believe me, isn't cheap for us to pay for.
[02:44:05.908 --> 02:44:09.690]  Thousands of dollars a month to serve hundreds of thousands of you just on the podcast.
[02:44:11.691 --> 02:44:12.012]  Free.
[02:44:12.972 --> 02:44:13.573]  Tell everybody.
[02:44:13.613 --> 02:44:16.114]  The free podcast at Infowars.com.
[02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:28.043]  And then it just serves it right to your MP3 player, right to your iPod, and there's no excuse, and you can sit there and you can listen, you can fast forward, pass whatever you don't like, free.
[02:44:29.084 --> 02:44:30.604]  Tell people about it.
[02:44:31.945 --> 02:44:36.106]  I'm not pleased and I'm not satisfied with hundreds of thousands of podcast listeners.
[02:44:36.286 --> 02:44:37.366]  I want tens of millions.
[02:44:38.927 --> 02:44:46.069]  I want to circumvent the mainstream media that's pulled out every stop they can to censor and to block us and to keep us from reaching the people.
[02:44:47.066 --> 02:44:48.166]  I don't want them to win.
[02:44:48.567 --> 02:44:53.408]  I'm not endangering my life and everything I do for nothing.
[02:44:53.508 --> 02:44:55.269]  I'm doing this to beat these criminals.
[02:44:55.729 --> 02:44:56.830]  I know we can beat them.
[02:44:58.490 --> 02:45:00.671]  If we can just recognize them as enemies.
[02:45:01.051 --> 02:45:02.252]  Your governors are enemies.
[02:45:02.572 --> 02:45:04.272]  Most of your congressmen and women are enemies.
[02:45:04.532 --> 02:45:05.633]  Your senators are enemies.
[02:45:05.873 --> 02:45:11.135]  The President, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, all of them are New World Order pimps.
[02:45:11.455 --> 02:45:13.756]  Paid for mafia minions.
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:17.083]  They're operatives of the global corporate state.
[02:45:17.383 --> 02:45:18.384]  Do you understand?
[02:45:18.404 --> 02:45:20.647]  They need to be seen as enemies.
[02:45:21.148 --> 02:45:26.413]  They need to get past the whole fake political spectrum they project to confuse you.
[02:45:26.473 --> 02:45:27.455]  It is an illusion.
[02:45:28.275 --> 02:45:29.397]  And it's skin deep.
[02:45:29.857 --> 02:45:31.319]  It is like a mist.
[02:45:32.173 --> 02:45:41.437]  You can just walk right behind the screen and see the little man behind the curtain anytime you want to, but you've got to be willing to face what you see on the other side of that curtain.
[02:45:41.617 --> 02:45:44.899]  And believe me, folks, it's a lot more scary than a little man.
[02:45:47.620 --> 02:45:52.802]  You're going to find what can only be described as the devil and his legions behind that curtain.
[02:45:54.423 --> 02:45:59.285]  And when you find out how evil these people are, it will chill you, but I hope it will also motivate you.
[02:46:00.538 --> 02:46:02.139]  They don't just not care about your life.
[02:46:02.199 --> 02:46:04.160]  They enjoy sorrow.
[02:46:05.420 --> 02:46:05.720]  Okay?
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:07.921]  They're the opposite of normal people.
[02:46:09.722 --> 02:46:11.043]  They are the priest of power.
[02:46:11.103 --> 02:46:12.143]  They are into power.
[02:46:12.564 --> 02:46:13.584]  Raw power.
[02:46:14.004 --> 02:46:15.005]  Raw control.
[02:46:18.106 --> 02:46:21.027]  So please, tell everyone about the podcast.
[02:46:21.107 --> 02:46:23.228]  Tell everyone you know about the internet streams.
[02:46:23.489 --> 02:46:24.169]  Free.
[02:46:24.369 --> 02:46:25.129]  24 hours a day.
[02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:26.770]  In 16-bit.
[02:46:27.851 --> 02:46:28.631]  Pretty good quality.
[02:46:29.372 --> 02:46:31.793]  Streaming out to you 24 hours a day.
[02:46:31.833 --> 02:46:34.534]  My show airs over and over and over again.
[02:46:34.574 --> 02:46:35.274]  A live 11 to 2.
[02:46:35.314 --> 02:46:36.054]  It airs, airs, airs.
[02:46:36.334 --> 02:46:38.435]  If you're listening on the AM or FM station, even better.
[02:46:38.855 --> 02:46:40.675]  Tell people at red lights.
[02:46:40.775 --> 02:46:41.796]  Tell people on the street.
[02:46:42.196 --> 02:46:42.996]  Tell your neighbors.
[02:46:43.136 --> 02:46:43.896]  Tell them at church.
[02:46:44.397 --> 02:46:46.137]  Print up little flyers on your computer.
[02:46:46.437 --> 02:46:47.938]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:46:48.018 --> 02:46:48.998]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[02:46:49.338 --> 02:46:51.299]  Wake up everybody you know.
[02:46:51.459 --> 02:46:52.419]  Get aggressive!
[02:46:55.501 --> 02:46:57.262]  There's a few other shows I can recommend.
[02:46:57.302 --> 02:46:59.963]  People like Dr. Stan Monteith, Pastor Butch Paul.
[02:47:01.964 --> 02:47:04.125]  There's a few other shows I can recommend that are good.
[02:47:04.885 --> 02:47:05.545]  Promote them.
[02:47:05.605 --> 02:47:07.826]  Some of the other Patriot shows are diseased.
[02:47:08.787 --> 02:47:14.769]  They're a bunch of egomaniacs attacking other Patriots and straw men and just lunacy.
[02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:18.851]  You've got to be the leaders.
[02:47:18.991 --> 02:47:20.031]  You've got to get out there.
[02:47:20.051 --> 02:47:21.332]  Start your own radio shows.
[02:47:22.012 --> 02:47:22.992]  Start your own local show.
[02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:24.113]  Start your own webcast.
[02:47:24.253 --> 02:47:24.873]  I don't care.
[02:47:24.933 --> 02:47:26.894]  Get involved in the fight now.
[02:47:27.634 --> 02:47:28.674]  The people are waking up.
[02:47:28.734 --> 02:47:30.835]  We just don't have the leaders we need.
[02:47:32.776 --> 02:47:34.116]  I told you I'm not your leader.
[02:47:34.657 --> 02:47:35.637]  I don't want to be your leader.
[02:47:38.858 --> 02:47:40.479]  You need to be leaders in your area.
[02:47:41.957 --> 02:47:46.039]  Really, this isn't me just putting this out.
[02:47:46.659 --> 02:47:54.622]  I'm asking you to enlist in the defense, the last-ditch defense, the last-ditch defense of this country!
[02:47:58.204 --> 02:48:08.108]  They got their pretty billboards and their TVs and their big Christmas trees and everybody running around buying stuff and cramming cheeseburgers in their mouth, but behind it is Ritalin and Prozac and Mercury.
[02:48:10.302 --> 02:48:13.803]  And degradation and factories shutting down and the dollar devalued.
[02:48:13.844 --> 02:48:15.584]  I mean, we're in serious trouble.
[02:48:15.904 --> 02:48:17.725]  And the public has been anesthetized.
[02:48:18.846 --> 02:48:21.527]  Has basically been happy gassed by all this propaganda.
[02:48:22.087 --> 02:48:25.408]  We have to cut through it like a laser beam.
[02:48:26.269 --> 02:48:28.369]  And we have to cut through it now.
[02:48:31.331 --> 02:48:32.791]  So tell folks about the broadcast.
[02:48:32.811 --> 02:48:34.292]  I think we're doing the best job out there.
[02:48:34.672 --> 02:48:35.552]  That isn't saying much.
[02:48:35.592 --> 02:48:36.953]  That shows us how much trouble we're in.
[02:48:38.013 --> 02:48:39.254]  But you tune in because...
[02:48:39.924 --> 02:48:42.045]  We're doing the best job that's being done.
[02:48:42.405 --> 02:48:48.147]  I'm asking you to do better.
[02:48:48.887 --> 02:48:52.028]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.388 --> 02:48:54.329]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.689 --> 02:49:02.312]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.024 --> 02:49:10.067]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.467 --> 02:49:21.892]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.212 --> 02:49:25.734]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.174 --> 02:49:28.095]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.435 --> 02:49:32.277]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:00.692 --> 02:52:02.373]  You know what the last ditch is?
[02:52:02.513 --> 02:52:03.394]  It's in a war.
[02:52:03.414 --> 02:52:09.837]  The old system of trench warfare when they run across four or five of your defenses and they're coming to the last ditch.
[02:52:10.357 --> 02:52:13.559]  Coming over into your ditch to bayonet you.
[02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:16.681]  Okay, they've hit the last ditch.
[02:52:16.781 --> 02:52:19.262]  Now the public's kind of going, Hey, what is that?
[02:52:19.702 --> 02:52:21.624]  Huh, I did hear something about global government.
[02:52:21.864 --> 02:52:24.345]  I did hear something about one-child policies in America.
[02:52:24.625 --> 02:52:26.086]  I did hear something about forced drugging.
[02:52:26.266 --> 02:52:27.687]  Huh, what's that coming over the ditch?
[02:52:28.357 --> 02:52:41.372]  And so a lot of them aren't going to listen now, but when they hit the ditch, as they get bayoneted by the New World Order, by CPS, and by the tax man, and by the cops at the checkpoint, that's when it's coming.
[02:52:41.392 --> 02:52:44.055]  And that's when we're finally going to beat you.
[02:52:44.416 --> 02:52:47.960]  Because they're not going to know they're under attack until they're in the ditch.
[02:52:49.756 --> 02:52:52.398]  A lot of these yuppies and others, a lot of them are going to try to serve.
[02:52:52.718 --> 02:52:54.760]  They're going to be there at the ditch, and this is all figurative.
[02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:55.680]  It's an allegory.
[02:52:56.341 --> 02:52:58.602]  Oh, the bad men are here.
[02:52:58.703 --> 02:52:59.643]  Come get them.
[02:52:59.723 --> 02:53:03.306]  Once the yuppies finally see it, they'll go, I want to join.
[02:53:03.366 --> 02:53:04.807]  Can I have one of your uniforms?
[02:53:08.852 --> 02:53:11.654]  A lot of smart people, by the way, just decide to serve the system.
[02:53:11.694 --> 02:53:15.797]  I've talked to a lot of lawyers, high-powered lobbyists, former big politicians, some current.
[02:53:16.237 --> 02:53:19.019]  Oh, Alex, we all know it's true, but you've just got to work in it.
[02:53:19.059 --> 02:53:20.420]  You know, that's how it is.
[02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:26.385]  I hope you will go to Infowars.com in the fight and get Terror Storm, get American Freedom of Fascism.
[02:53:26.745 --> 02:53:28.586]  Get them, make copies, get them out to everybody.
[02:53:28.626 --> 02:53:29.767]  Give them as Christmas presents.
[02:53:31.228 --> 02:53:33.309]  I hope you'll get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.

[02:53:41.607 --> 02:53:44.388]  If you've already got my films, make copies of them aggressively.
[02:53:44.708 --> 02:53:49.489]  Tell folks about the Google, how you can watch on Google Video Terror Storm for free.
[02:53:50.609 --> 02:53:52.189]  Help me get this out to people.
[02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:53.570]  Warn the population.
[02:53:54.650 --> 02:53:56.570]  Let's go to Jeff in Michigan.
[02:53:56.610 --> 02:53:57.230]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:53:58.531 --> 02:53:59.711]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:00.491 --> 02:54:05.432]  Up here in the Great Lakes, I don't know how much you've heard, but the Coast Guard right now is wanting to
[02:54:06.664 --> 02:54:07.724]  We're good to go.
[02:54:30.088 --> 02:54:31.929]  Yes, that was in Michigan papers.
[02:54:32.049 --> 02:54:33.530]  That was in Illinois papers.
[02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:39.873]  There was an IMF World Bank agreement to let big tankers come in and get fresh water.
[02:54:40.493 --> 02:54:44.535]  They load oil tankers with it and take it back to other places, believe it or not.
[02:54:44.555 --> 02:54:44.976]  Okay.
[02:54:44.996 --> 02:54:47.017]  And it's been put into an international zone.
[02:54:47.697 --> 02:54:48.357]  Oh.
[02:54:48.497 --> 02:54:49.878]  I don't remember the exact articles.
[02:54:50.178 --> 02:54:53.520]  Okay.
[02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:55.241]  Who has control?
[02:54:55.261 --> 02:54:57.482]  I mean, I can see what you're saying as far as
[02:54:58.086 --> 02:55:04.467]  The IMF has control over the water supply, but do we as the state still have control?
[02:55:04.487 --> 02:55:10.269]  Yeah, one side of the Great Lakes is U.S., out to the middle, and on the other side is Canada.
[02:55:11.149 --> 02:55:12.029]  Okay.
[02:55:12.429 --> 02:55:25.952]  And then one other thing, I completely agree with you on previous arguments you've had against child family services, but on behalf of my parents, they were foster parents also, I just needed to defend their honor in saying that
[02:55:26.584 --> 02:55:28.385]  There are some good foster parents out there.
[02:55:28.425 --> 02:55:30.167]  I mean, there are terrible ones, too.
[02:55:30.267 --> 02:55:30.947]  Hold on a second.
[02:55:31.007 --> 02:55:33.389]  Take Hutton Gibson, Mel Gibson's dad.
[02:55:33.729 --> 02:55:34.910]  He had ten children.
[02:55:35.631 --> 02:55:37.973]  They loved children so much they adopted another child.
[02:55:38.793 --> 02:55:40.815]  Okay, I'm not adopted, but my sister is.
[02:55:41.676 --> 02:55:42.016]  Okay?
[02:55:42.496 --> 02:55:45.659]  I'm not saying... I'm saying five times more likely.
[02:55:46.319 --> 02:55:52.504]  I'm saying that it's... I'm saying the government has a horrible record compared to the general public, so they have no...
[02:55:53.468 --> 02:55:55.629]  Moral authority to sit around bossing everybody.
[02:55:55.649 --> 02:55:56.269]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:55:56.569 --> 02:55:57.569]  I agree with you completely.
[02:55:57.889 --> 02:55:59.610]  Okay, so your parents are great.
[02:56:00.010 --> 02:56:00.950]  Hutton Gibson's great.
[02:56:00.990 --> 02:56:01.870]  My parents are great.
[02:56:03.891 --> 02:56:05.151]  You know, that's what I'm saying here.
[02:56:05.751 --> 02:56:12.073]  I'm saying the government and the big foster home mills where they got 20 kids, five times more likely.
[02:56:12.933 --> 02:56:15.614]  It's like saying the cops are twice as likely to be involved in crime.
[02:56:16.154 --> 02:56:17.774]  That's not saying all the police are criminals.
[02:56:18.194 --> 02:56:19.395]  I'm just stating a fact.
[02:56:19.855 --> 02:56:20.935]  God bless you all.
