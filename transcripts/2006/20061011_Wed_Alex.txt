[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.161]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:07.901]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.742]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:11.182]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:12.802]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:17.283]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:21.805]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.706]  The pace of everything is intensifying.
[00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.107]  The drumbeat is now...
[00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:53.003]  Moving so quickly in its rhythm that you can barely separate the different blows on the drumhead as we hurdle towards one world government, as we accelerate into total micromanagement with a high-tech dehumanization slave extermination grid being lowered over us.
[00:00:53.846 --> 00:01:03.297]  And some of us see the net, some of us read the enemy publications, the enemy public transmissions of what they plan to do to us, and we warn the people.
[00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:07.441]  Many don't listen, but many are beginning to listen.
[00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:13.048]  I'm Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide on the Internet, shortwave, AM and FM stations.
[00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:37.616]  This is a defense of the human species against our own species, a predator class in the human species that has always arisen in civilization in the last 6,000 years since civilization developed, has now gotten high-tech tools to expand their level of micromanagement, control, and enslavement.
[00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:38.818]  We're good to go.
[00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:39.038]  I think?
[00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.845]  Again, their statements are public, but the public doesn't go and read government documents or think tank documents.
[00:01:59.205 --> 00:02:03.490]  Their programs are moving ahead, but more resistance is mounting.
[00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.931]  We are resisting.
[00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.012]  We are defending.
[00:02:06.453 --> 00:02:08.395]  We are standing up for humanity.
[00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:09.456]  We're good to go.
[00:02:09.516 --> 00:02:09.756]  I think?
[00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:29.797]  I think we're good to go.
[00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:48.112]  As packs of venomous wolves rending and savaging their own species.
[00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:50.694]  Humans are super predators.
[00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:53.916]  We have been the most powerful species on the planet.
[00:02:54.257 --> 00:03:03.343]  And now that humans have dominated every other species, we are now engaging in intramural warfare and a tiny elite who wishes to remain hidden
[00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.883]  He's now being exposed.
[00:03:06.283 --> 00:03:17.987]  So as their crimes become greater, as the abuse against you becomes greater, many of you who are laughing now, I want you to remember when it gets really bad, who your enemies are and who carried out these attacks upon you.
[00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:21.388]  Maybe then we'll have a chance of defeating these parasites.
[00:03:22.308 --> 00:03:24.829]  The parasites are threatening to destroy the entire host.
[00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:26.809]  We're good to go.
[00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:27.049]  I think?
[00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:51.811]  The USA Today, I have the Daily Mail all announcing in unison that masses of the population are preparing to take implantable microchips for discounts on buying and selling.
[00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:54.792]  Headline, young shoppers want to pay with a chip in the skin.
[00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:56.753]  Of course, no one is saying they want this.
[00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:58.554]  It's just being announced that everyone wants it.
[00:03:58.874 --> 00:04:00.795]  Again, you are living in the twilight zone.
[00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:02.375]  Countries threatening to nuke us.
[00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.637]  Big, huge newspapers in unison saying everyone wants chips.
[00:04:07.858 --> 00:04:12.120]  Again, we're entering this vortex where everything is accelerating technologically.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.480]  Every two years, the technology doubles.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:23.404]  That's the known technology, not the hidden technology 40 years ahead that has been exponentially dividing and exponentially growing.
[00:04:24.684 --> 00:04:28.325]  Again, this is where much of the arrogance and humor comes from in the elite.
[00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:33.287]  We cannot even imagine the untold technologies they've been suppressing.
[00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:57.644]  We are in just major crisis mode as a species, and this broadcast is only one small part of the organic response of the human species against an aberrant, carcinogenic subspecies of super predator Homo sapiens sapien, now tending Homo sapien as cattle, and now preparing mass culls.
[00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:07.554]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:09.856]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:17.881]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:25.605]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:28.948]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.649]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:32.910]  NSA spies.
[00:05:34.322 --> 00:05:37.443]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:05:37.723 --> 00:05:41.224]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:43.625]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:47.866]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:07.085]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:11.646]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:12.507]  We listened.
[00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:17.969]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.749]  We listened.
[00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.290]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:23.251]  We listened.
[00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:26.712]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:06:29.157 --> 00:06:34.562]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:34.982 --> 00:06:36.384]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:44.311]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:47.492]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:47.912]  Only $279.
[00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:48.573]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.613 --> 00:06:48.933]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:06:50.314 --> 00:06:51.094]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:05.346]  If you're tired of spending a small fortune every time you fill up, now you can do something about it.
[00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:12.068]  Ethos FR, a product used all over the world, has reported savings of up to 19% on gas and even reduced emissions of up to 30%.
[00:07:12.788 --> 00:07:17.530]  Ethos FR is easy to use and works with any kind of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.
[00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:25.012]  Ethos FR works by reformulating the gas in your tank to burn more completely, resulting in a cleaner engine, better mileage, more power, and fewer emissions.

[00:07:31.656 --> 00:07:34.137]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:36.498]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:40.399]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:47.502]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:07:51.343 --> 00:07:52.784]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:07.771]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.993 --> 00:08:25.602]  Well, we had guests lined up today yet again, but I just had them canceled, as I did on Monday, because I want to have time to take your calls, I want to have time to go over the news and information, all of the earth.
[00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:32.030]  Rattling developments that are taking place on our planet with our species.
[00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:54.294]  But I got a call from Jason Bermas with the Loose Change crew reporting, and I said, wait, wait, before you report what they're now doing to Loose Change online, before you report that to me, let me guess, they're not erasing Loose Change's numbers now that they've been caught doing a terror storm.
[00:08:55.313 --> 00:08:56.914]  They're freezing the numbers.
[00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:01.236]  And he said, yes, they're freezing the numbers to knock us out of the top 100.
[00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:11.382]  Now, Google Video, and if you're sick of hearing about this, I'm sick of it happening, but there are new developments.
[00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:17.886]  If you get into the top 100 of Google, there's something like 100 million people every week that go and watch videos on there.
[00:09:17.906 --> 00:09:22.008]  That's what I read in the press a few months ago, and it's growing exponentially.
[00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:28.563]  And when you're in the top 100, many of those 100 million go and peruse that.
[00:09:28.603 --> 00:09:31.505]  And once you get in the top 100, it's kind of hard to get out of the top 100.
[00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.510]  And we first discovered it three weeks ago.
[00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.412]  Now there's evidence that was going on before.
[00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:47.138]  But Google, two separate times, admits that they erased the viewer statistics for Terror Storm, my new film...
[00:09:48.556 --> 00:09:55.339]  And hence knocking it out of the top 100 as it was rising on its way to being number one.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:03.303]  And we noticed that other 9-11 films, other films, period, because after I first caught them, I began to monitor the others.
[00:10:03.343 --> 00:10:04.304]  They hadn't been erased.
[00:10:04.684 --> 00:10:08.566]  When they erased mine again about a week ago, it hadn't been erased.
[00:10:10.456 --> 00:10:18.560]  And then Google had to put out a larger press release that thousands of people got, it's been sent to me thousands of times, saying, yes, we did it again, but it's all an accident.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.362]  Then they lied and said, but we're doing it to other people, not just Terror Storm.
[00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:24.042]  That's not true.
[00:10:26.884 --> 00:10:31.026]  And now they have frozen the Patriot videos.
[00:10:31.826 --> 00:10:32.306]  All of them.
[00:10:34.007 --> 00:10:38.489]  Again, every night, I spend about 30 minutes tracking this because it's so interesting, plus it's so important.
[00:10:39.381 --> 00:10:40.822]  And I didn't want to announce it yet.
[00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:43.763]  I've been tracking it for three or four days since I noticed it.
[00:10:43.783 --> 00:10:46.625]  And I was saying, well, maybe the new numbers aren't coming up.
[00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:50.167]  So I went through watching other mainstream films, other mainstream videos.
[00:10:50.327 --> 00:10:54.309]  Their counters are live time going up every few hours.
[00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:59.331]  I noticed Terror Storm wasn't going up for several days, many of the versions.
[00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:01.272]  But I said, I'm going to wait and see.
[00:11:01.312 --> 00:11:03.353]  Maybe in a few days it will just bump up dramatically.
[00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:05.474]  Then I said, let me go over and look at Loose Change.
[00:11:05.494 --> 00:11:06.755]  This was about three days ago.
[00:11:07.415 --> 00:11:08.856]  And I noticed they had been frozen.
[00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:18.113]  You know, one would be three million, one would be two million, one would be one million, because they uploaded new versions a few weeks ago, so they started back over again.
[00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:25.682]  And I thought, you know, I also noticed, well, that's funny, they've got millions of views, but they're not in the top...
[00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:31.096]  100 anymore, but stuff with just a few hundred thousand views is.
[00:11:31.116 --> 00:11:37.197]  And I noticed they froze in their hip counter to knock them out, to cheat them out.
[00:11:37.737 --> 00:11:50.659]  So I guess by pointing out they hadn't censored them, why were they just censoring Terror Storm has now caused a system-wide, I guess they're listening and figured out their mistakes, and now it's a bunch of other Patriot videos, 9-11 videos, the same thing.
[00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:56.000]  So the phone rings, Kevin's in there about 30 minutes ago, and he says, hey, I know you said no guest today, but...
[00:11:56.926 --> 00:11:58.106]  Jason Berners is on the line.
[00:11:58.126 --> 00:11:58.967]  Do you want to have him on?
[00:11:59.127 --> 00:12:00.327]  Jason wasn't asking to come on.
[00:12:00.347 --> 00:12:01.627]  He was just calling to tell us.
[00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.388]  He said, hey, they're doing something to lose change.
[00:12:03.408 --> 00:12:04.728]  And I said, let me guess.
[00:12:04.768 --> 00:12:05.489]  Stop right there.
[00:12:06.089 --> 00:12:06.909]  I said, don't tell me.
[00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:11.030]  Because I want to confer and show you I'm doing research on this.
[00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.111]  I said, your hit counters have been frozen for at least three days.
[00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:15.852]  And that's when I noticed it and started looking.
[00:12:17.252 --> 00:12:18.412]  Actually, I started noticing.
[00:12:19.092 --> 00:12:19.653]  Time flies.
[00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:20.513]  It was actually last Friday.
[00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:23.894]  So I keep saying, that would be one, two, three, four, five, six days.
[00:12:23.934 --> 00:12:24.254]  Excuse me.
[00:12:25.501 --> 00:12:25.961]  You know how it is.
[00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:28.402]  You start thinking about something, it's three and away, it's really six days.
[00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:29.723]  Time gets away from you.
[00:12:30.703 --> 00:12:32.624]  So there's no debating it.
[00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:34.625]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts.
[00:12:34.665 --> 00:12:38.466]  Google has admittedly been caught censoring the entire Chinese web.
[00:12:38.846 --> 00:12:41.027]  They've now been caught censoring the Indian web.
[00:12:41.368 --> 00:12:44.489]  They've now been caught censoring the Middle Eastern web.
[00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:45.889]  They've announced they're censoring.
[00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:47.870]  They put it on their website they're censoring.
[00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.112]  YouTube told the New York Times yesterday they're going to censor any hate content
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.040]  We're good to go.
[00:13:07.893 --> 00:13:09.394]  And it's because we're cleaning their clocks.
[00:13:09.514 --> 00:13:15.238]  They don't like it that I can make a film, and in a month and a half of being on the web, it gets four million viewers.
[00:13:15.278 --> 00:13:20.122]  And again, it's like when you're accelerating towards light speed.
[00:13:20.162 --> 00:13:22.724]  The faster you go, you just exponentially go quicker.
[00:13:23.564 --> 00:13:37.468]  It took a month and a half to get to 2 million, and then it took a week to get to 4 million, and then it was going to take a few days to get to 8 million, and then another week to get to 20 million, and then another week to get to 30 million, and another, oh yes, we're crushing the New World Order!
[00:13:37.908 --> 00:13:40.069]  We've got our hands around their throats!
[00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:41.870]  So I don't blame them.
[00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.952]  They've got to knock it, cut it, stop, no, disconnect.
[00:13:46.352 --> 00:13:48.193]  It'll be too obvious if we remove these videos.
[00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:49.354]  Just keep them out of the top 100.
[00:13:49.514 --> 00:13:57.738]  Their algorithm studies have shown that that will keep them from reaching a mass audience and going viral, as they call it.
[00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:01.240]  I coined the term supernova.
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:09.644]  I don't like the term viral, because information is a connotation of good, in my opinion, if it's truthful or objective or from another angle.
[00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:15.933]  But I guess supernova really is more destructive than viruses, so whatever.
[00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:17.454]  I'm now digressing.
[00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:23.096]  The point is, this is becoming a major scandal.
[00:14:24.177 --> 00:14:38.184]  And so Jason will be joining us in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast for a segment to discuss this, and I'll get Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Ryan Slickheisen, Aaron Dykes, whoever around here wants to engage the enemy with me and get a report out on this.
[00:14:40.425 --> 00:14:42.208]  Okay, let me give you a rundown of what we're going to cover.
[00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:44.752]  North Korea has threatened to blow up U.S.
[00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:45.173]  cities.
[00:14:45.574 --> 00:14:47.817]  They have missiles that can hit U.S.
[00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:48.218]  cities.
[00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:48.719]  They have...
[00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:52.106]  Well, we don't know how many they have.
[00:14:52.146 --> 00:14:55.168]  We know they get out on the tarmac upwards of 50 missiles.
[00:14:55.208 --> 00:14:56.989]  We know they'll test three or four at a time.
[00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:59.971]  We know they've shot missiles that go out in the middle of the Pacific.
[00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:01.532]  They've fired missiles that go over Japan.
[00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:05.575]  We know the Taipan Dong-2s are based on a Chinese-slash-U.S.
[00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:09.437]  design, though it's primitive, an early 60s-type technology.
[00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:16.342]  It can't hit Chicago, Seattle, New York, Boston, Toronto, places like that.
[00:15:16.602 --> 00:15:18.043]  They shoot over the North Pole.
[00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:32.237]  I mean, most of their missile tests, they shoot out towards the Pacific because there's less land mass, and I guess they don't want to start World War III, though in 2000 they did, according to the mainstream press reports in Japan and South Korea, hit the U.S.
[00:15:32.257 --> 00:15:33.278]  with a test missile.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.580]  Again, without a warhead.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.122]  Without a payload.
[00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:43.628]  And North Korea, think of it, North Korea has missiles, has atomic weapons,
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:58.125]  That our government through AQ Khan in Pakistan and through ABB and the Swiss and their chairman, their vice chairman, Donald Rumsfeld, they are armed, threatening to nuke us if we put sanctions on them.
[00:15:58.865 --> 00:16:01.126]  Japan has slapped total sanctions on them.
[00:16:01.607 --> 00:16:07.149]  All their ships are barred from their waters, barred from their ports, barred from trade, no more aid.
[00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:11.891]  Japan gives them heating oil, rice, money, just you name it.
[00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:13.932]  It's billions every year.
[00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:16.712]  The South Koreans are talking about cutting off aid.
[00:16:17.372 --> 00:16:18.232]  Of course, the U.S.
[00:16:18.292 --> 00:16:21.353]  is literally groveling, saying, we're not going to invade, we're not going to attack.
[00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:23.954]  China's saying, we're going to do nothing.
[00:16:25.274 --> 00:16:37.918]  Meanwhile, Iran had inspectors all over their country, peaceful systems, literally licking boots, a moderate president in, and the neocons said, that's not enough, and so they put in a hardliner, Ahmadinejad.
[00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:42.539]  Who knows whose side he's really on, with Iran's CIA past and history.
[00:16:43.698 --> 00:16:45.279]  But let's just look at it at face value.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:17:05.791]  And they've done nothing to us, and there's a carrier group about to arrive, another carrier in the Med, and another one cruising around there south of Africa, last time I checked, looking like it could be there in three or four days up there in the Persian Gulf area.
[00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:11.354]  So there's three carriers in the area, one of them admittedly going to the Persian Gulf area,
[00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:18.960]  And the neocons are openly saying they have special forces there preparing targets inside Iran, carrying out operations.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.681]  General's on scene and admitted.
[00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:22.022]  Cy Hirsch has got the documents.
[00:17:23.243 --> 00:17:25.185]  Openly threatening to hit them with nuclear weapons.
[00:17:25.225 --> 00:17:25.845]  Imagine Iran.
[00:17:25.885 --> 00:17:27.187]  You're being threatened with nuclear attack.
[00:17:27.427 --> 00:17:29.308]  Your government's been overthrown by the U.S.
[00:17:29.989 --> 00:17:31.650]  crime syndicate that controls the U.S.
[00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.211]  in 1953.
[00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:34.973]  Death camps and torture centers were set up.
[00:17:35.273 --> 00:17:38.035]  There are special forces of the foreign country inside your country.
[00:17:38.296 --> 00:17:39.857]  The foreign country's threatening to nuke you.
[00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:43.980]  North Korea's running around threatening to nuke the U.S.
[00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:45.961]  and, oh, that's probably not a real nuke.
[00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:47.382]  Oh, they're not a threat.
[00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:48.363]  Oh, they're not a problem.
[00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:49.743]  Never mind North Korea.
[00:17:49.783 --> 00:17:50.584]  Get Iran.
[00:17:50.624 --> 00:17:50.964]  Get them.
[00:17:51.004 --> 00:17:51.364]  Get them.
[00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:51.784]  Get them.
[00:17:54.886 --> 00:17:57.027]  So we're going to go over this report first when we get back.
[00:17:57.927 --> 00:18:02.489]  Then I have an amazing clip from Stan Jones, libertarian for U.S.
[00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:08.532]  Senate, on C-SPAN last night at the end of a debate he had with the sniveling Republicans and Democrats.
[00:18:10.695 --> 00:18:16.440]  And he gets into the New World Order, World Government, SPP, all of it.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.521]  And we're going to get Stan Jones on.
[00:18:18.561 --> 00:18:19.262]  We salute him.
[00:18:20.703 --> 00:18:22.464]  Hey, the rest of you out there are going to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:18:22.524 --> 00:18:24.185]  It's the New World Order.
[00:18:25.046 --> 00:18:25.907]  I can't help it, folks.
[00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:26.507]  I had to say it.
[00:18:27.348 --> 00:18:34.393]  But, you know, the king of stupid puns, the king of cliché, that's me.
[00:18:35.494 --> 00:18:38.777]  Stan Jones, Libertarian for U.S.
[00:18:38.957 --> 00:18:39.277]  Senate.
[00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:44.423]  To the people of Montana.
[00:18:44.643 --> 00:18:48.784]  We're going to put a link up on our website too, Mr. Jones' Senate stuff.
[00:18:48.804 --> 00:18:49.524]  We're going to get him on.
[00:18:49.564 --> 00:18:50.544]  Again, we're trying right now.
[00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:55.245]  In fact, if he could, we'd even have him on today, but I'll probably have him on tomorrow for a longer period of time.
[00:18:57.026 --> 00:19:00.566]  But we're very proud and very excited about what he said.
[00:19:00.586 --> 00:19:01.527]  We're going to play that clip.
[00:19:02.027 --> 00:19:05.488]  We're putting it up on... This thing hadn't even really been seen by any yet.
[00:19:05.508 --> 00:19:06.928]  When we saw it on YouTube, it had 200 views.
[00:19:07.972 --> 00:19:08.593]  We're good to go.
[00:19:08.613 --> 00:19:08.793]  I think?
[00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:34.220]  Infowars.net once a day, but it has a lot of original content, so it's excellent.
[00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:38.686]  But Jones Report is really our least visited mainline website.
[00:19:38.707 --> 00:19:45.256]  We've got a few others that are specialty sites, you know, one subject like Arnold Exposed or Marshall Law 911.info.
[00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:48.627]  But Jones Report deserves your traffic.
[00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:52.469]  So we're going to be posting the Stan Jones Libertarian for U.S.
[00:19:52.529 --> 00:19:53.350]  Senate clip up there.
[00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.211]  We're going to play it at the bottom of this hour.
[00:19:55.751 --> 00:20:00.374]  And for those of you that didn't get a chance to hear my conversation with John Ashcroft yesterday, we're going to play that again, too.
[00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:07.117]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:07.618 --> 00:20:09.999]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:10.808 --> 00:20:19.231]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:25.093]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:20:25.733 --> 00:20:35.716]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:20:36.196 --> 00:20:38.457]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:20:39.286 --> 00:20:40.466]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:40.486 --> 00:20:40.526]  702-953-0267.

[00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:42.987]  That's www.lazemedinc.com.
[00:21:01.835 --> 00:21:08.041]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:16.268]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:16.629 --> 00:21:24.476]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:29.537]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.877 --> 00:21:34.578]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:35.078 --> 00:21:38.939]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:39.439 --> 00:21:40.459]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:40.519 --> 00:21:44.600]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:21:49.921 --> 00:21:52.442]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:52.762 --> 00:21:53.243]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[00:22:01.431 --> 00:22:06.392]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[00:22:20.116 --> 00:22:23.557]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:22:23.897 --> 00:22:33.246]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:22:33.506 --> 00:22:37.010]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:44.357]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:23:25.644 --> 00:23:29.486]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[00:23:29.886 --> 00:23:33.688]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.
[00:23:34.168 --> 00:23:36.449]  So many different cell products available for you.
[00:23:36.869 --> 00:23:38.429]  It's time to let the secret out.

[00:23:49.632 --> 00:23:50.332]  Music
[00:24:15.952 --> 00:24:22.854]  We're here for now, but tomorrow we're forever gone.
[00:24:22.874 --> 00:24:33.858]  Remember that when you live your life and you're worried about petty baubles and trinkets and sickness of status and when you lust after goods and power.
[00:24:34.499 --> 00:24:35.819]  It's all going to go away.
[00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:40.661]  It all falls like the mountains will one day crumble into the sea.
[00:24:42.558 --> 00:24:45.900]  So coming up in about 10 minutes, I'm going to air this Stan Jones Libertarian for U.S.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.041]  Senate from C-SPAN.
[00:24:47.641 --> 00:24:49.722]  Just going public about one world government.
[00:24:49.762 --> 00:24:51.183]  More and more of us going public.
[00:24:51.983 --> 00:24:53.284]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:24:54.225 --> 00:24:57.386]  And again, yesterday morning, I was in the shower.
[00:24:57.446 --> 00:24:58.367]  My wife runs in.
[00:24:58.407 --> 00:24:59.408]  National radio show.
[00:24:59.508 --> 00:25:01.969]  Mancow's Morning Madhouse had called.
[00:25:01.989 --> 00:25:04.130]  They had Attorney General John Ashcroft in studio.
[00:25:05.011 --> 00:25:06.892]  And they said, we want you to go on against Ashcroft.
[00:25:07.732 --> 00:25:10.614]  And then Mancow acted like I was just a caller and put me on with him.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.281]  And I prefaced it with, I was half awake.
[00:25:14.362 --> 00:25:15.543]  And I told listeners that.
[00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:18.144]  Sharing up the message boards, the emails.
[00:25:18.164 --> 00:25:19.605]  It was a minority of them, but still.
[00:25:19.965 --> 00:25:20.926]  You screwed up.
[00:25:20.966 --> 00:25:22.647]  You should have asked Ashcroft this.
[00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:24.248]  You screwed up.
[00:25:24.308 --> 00:25:26.729]  You know, you didn't do a good job with Ashcroft.
[00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.811]  Folks, number one, I'm not a morning person.
[00:25:29.911 --> 00:25:37.496]  And if I've been awake roughly five minutes, I got out of bed, went and got in the shower, my wife ran in,
[00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.230]  We're good to go.
[00:26:03.553 --> 00:26:03.973]  We're good to go.
[00:26:34.175 --> 00:26:36.096]  We're good to go.
[00:26:36.176 --> 00:26:36.456]  I think?
[00:26:57.074 --> 00:26:59.836]  I'm not saying everybody out there is sniping 24-7s and operatives.
[00:26:59.856 --> 00:27:02.037]  No, most of them are mockingbirds.
[00:27:02.598 --> 00:27:05.340]  Most of them are quackers.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.862]  Most of them repeat like parrots.
[00:27:09.442 --> 00:27:10.303]  Polly, you want a cracker?
[00:27:10.343 --> 00:27:11.143]  Polly, you want a cracker?
[00:27:11.864 --> 00:27:14.766]  Over and over again, they repeat what they hear.
[00:27:16.027 --> 00:27:24.232]  And again, I prefaced the clip we played yesterday with the fact that I was literally right out of bed, basically, when I went up against Ashcroft.
[00:27:24.798 --> 00:27:26.259]  But later I thought about questions.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.240]  What was I supposed to say?
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.121]  What was I supposed to do?
[00:27:28.482 --> 00:27:30.624]  I would have just said, 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:27:31.004 --> 00:27:32.385]  You were involved, traitor!
[00:27:33.426 --> 00:27:35.989]  Which I would have done at a public function where they couldn't hang up on me.
[00:27:36.693 --> 00:27:39.635]  If I'd have been in a public function, I did confront Janet Reno in person.
[00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:47.378]  I did come out and say she was basically blood on her hands and that it was mass murder at Waco and that the Delta Force did it under her command.
[00:27:47.739 --> 00:27:49.880]  Because Janet Reno couldn't run off the stage.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.601]  Janet Reno couldn't get away.
[00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:56.023]  I was at the microphone down there at the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum.
[00:27:58.263 --> 00:28:05.810]  But when you're on the phone with somebody, if I would have just said 9-11 is an inside job and you were involved, he would have just laughed at me and Mankow probably would have let me go.
[00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:15.258]  But I brought up serious questions trying to trip him up, and we did trip him up and put a big article out yesterday that's at the top of Infowars.com right now.
[00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:18.060]  Please get it out to everybody.
[00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:24.660]  And again, I'm not here whining on air because a few people sent me emails and I went and looked at a few of the blogs.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.282]  You know, I do that just to see what people are saying about our reports.
[00:28:28.843 --> 00:28:32.465]  I was over on 911blogger.com and I thought, oh, let me see what the comments are.
[00:28:33.025 --> 00:28:36.948]  And about half of them were, ah, look at Jones.
[00:28:37.408 --> 00:28:39.970]  He, you know, he's, uh...
[00:28:41.315 --> 00:28:45.596]  Being too easy on Ashcroft, or Jones, man, drop the ball.
[00:28:45.636 --> 00:28:47.036]  He should have asked tougher questions.
[00:28:47.276 --> 00:28:48.997]  Well, what are those tougher questions?
[00:28:51.017 --> 00:28:52.657]  I mean, imagine, this is my weird life.
[00:28:53.057 --> 00:28:55.458]  I'm in the shower, and they go, come confront Ashcroft.
[00:28:55.578 --> 00:28:55.978]  Okay.
[00:28:56.958 --> 00:28:58.038]  And they said, right now.
[00:28:58.218 --> 00:29:01.079]  And it was a good thing I got down there quick, because then they went to break, and that was it.
[00:29:02.199 --> 00:29:03.199]  Just a few minutes later.
[00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:05.920]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.580]  The point is...
[00:29:09.349 --> 00:29:14.914]  I'm trying the best I can, and I want everybody to know, I know that I'm not the best at what I do.
[00:29:15.114 --> 00:29:18.518]  I know that I'm a failed, flawed person.
[00:29:18.558 --> 00:29:19.158]  We all are.
[00:29:20.119 --> 00:29:20.479]  Okay?
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.262]  But we all, at the same time, are successes.
[00:29:23.342 --> 00:29:24.323]  We fail, we succeed.
[00:29:24.983 --> 00:29:26.185]  But I think I did a pretty good job.
[00:29:26.265 --> 00:29:27.906]  I got in the arena with John Ashcroft.
[00:29:29.147 --> 00:29:30.849]  I threw hard questions at him.
[00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.092]  And I just don't think people out there...
[00:29:35.114 --> 00:29:36.354]  Again, I'm worried about you.
[00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:38.615]  I'm not worried about the fact that you criticize me.
[00:29:38.655 --> 00:29:39.475]  Personally, I don't care.
[00:29:39.495 --> 00:29:40.356]  I got a very thick skin.
[00:29:40.436 --> 00:29:42.796]  In fact, I tend to like being attacked.
[00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:43.717]  It just makes me laugh.
[00:29:44.077 --> 00:29:45.077]  It's kind of sick, I think.
[00:29:45.137 --> 00:29:50.058]  But what I don't like is the fact that you're so screwed up.
[00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:52.559]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.660]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.872 --> 00:30:04.035]  Admit it, the moral rot in America runs deep.
[00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:11.023]  Massive debt, rampant materialism, pedophilia by clergy, endless war, and yes, the sin of religious cannibalism.
[00:30:11.284 --> 00:30:17.692]  Communion was practiced by the Aztecs, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Gnostics of the Mystery Schools long before the Messiah was born.
[00:30:18.052 --> 00:30:22.637]  Due to carefully placed forgeries within the New Covenant texts, the worship of pagan gods prevailed.
[00:30:22.917 --> 00:30:28.383]  The Church's sacred cannibalism service, known as Communion, is based upon words the Messiah never said.
[00:30:28.623 --> 00:30:29.924]  The Savior was no cannibal.
[00:30:30.185 --> 00:30:31.326]  He lived and taught the Torah.
[00:30:31.686 --> 00:30:32.147]  See proof!
[00:30:32.427 --> 00:30:35.110]  Get the book, Communion, the Bloodfest of Babylon, today.
[00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.233]  Write to Two Witnesses Ministries, PO Box 2453, Abilene, Texas.
[00:30:41.055 --> 00:30:51.783]  Yes, Gnostics did hijack the Antique to fulfill their devious plan to make abomination look holy.
[00:30:52.063 --> 00:30:56.086]  Gnostic conspiracy exposed in Communion, the Blood Fest of Babylon.
[00:30:56.326 --> 00:30:56.507]  Call 325-572-3913.
[00:31:01.348 --> 00:31:02.088]  Terrorism.
[00:31:02.268 --> 00:31:02.989]  Terrorism.
[00:31:03.109 --> 00:31:03.949]  Chemical attacks.
[00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.689]  Dirty bombs.
[00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:05.190]  Fallout.
[00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.270]  Biological attacks.
[00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.990]  And threats.
[00:31:07.071 --> 00:31:09.171]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:31:09.432 --> 00:31:11.032]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:31:11.272 --> 00:31:13.733]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:31:14.134 --> 00:31:28.700]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.060]  government.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.001]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:31:31.401 --> 00:31:37.323]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:31:37.463 --> 00:31:41.964]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:31:42.204 --> 00:31:49.666]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:49.686 --> 00:31:51.627]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:32:01.337 --> 00:32:03.818]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:32:03.939 --> 00:32:06.300]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:13.444]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:32:14.024 --> 00:32:16.326]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:32:16.986 --> 00:32:20.528]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:32:21.068 --> 00:32:25.191]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:32:25.771 --> 00:32:28.733]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:32:29.716 --> 00:32:30.156]  We're good to go.
[00:33:10.283 --> 00:33:11.964]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:11.984 --> 00:33:16.107]  We'll have open phones in the second and third hour, and we're going to take a lot of your calls today.
[00:33:16.147 --> 00:33:17.528]  First-time callers are always welcomed.
[00:33:17.588 --> 00:33:19.390]  If you disagree with me, here's how the rules work with calls.
[00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.751]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:33:39.122 --> 00:33:45.927]  Other than, if you disagree with something I'm saying, you go to the front of the line.
[00:33:47.349 --> 00:33:58.037]  See, unlike other mainstream talk radio shows who try to censor and control, and believe me, I've witnessed it firsthand, they try to find only stupid callers who disagree with them.
[00:33:59.796 --> 00:34:01.017]  And that's the secret to sneak past.
[00:34:01.077 --> 00:34:03.459]  I'm calling and go, I like Bill Clinton.
[00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:06.361]  I like that right-winger Bush.
[00:34:06.621 --> 00:34:07.442]  You're on.
[00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.043]  I mean, just bam.
[00:34:09.083 --> 00:34:12.666]  And then you get on and say, Bush is actually not a little conservative at all.
[00:34:12.706 --> 00:34:17.950]  He's destroying the borders, bringing in world government, expanding the size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.292]  And literally, I've done that before driving around on road trips.
[00:34:21.332 --> 00:34:23.774]  I've called in and gone, I've called in even testing it.
[00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:27.417]  And on some long eight-hour road trip, I'll call in and go,
[00:34:28.627 --> 00:34:30.708]  I've now got digressing, but it's an important story.
[00:34:32.189 --> 00:34:37.932]  I've called in and said, yes, I disagree with the fact that you're claiming this war is good, and the, quote, liberals are against it.
[00:34:37.972 --> 00:34:43.436]  The Democrats are actually voting for the war in the majority, and they've actually been warmongers in the past.
[00:34:43.456 --> 00:34:44.796]  I don't think this is a partisan issue.
[00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:48.799]  This is an issue of the defense contractors lobbying and wanting more war.
[00:34:49.499 --> 00:34:50.159]  Well, thank you.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.901]  We don't need that opinion right now.
[00:34:52.981 --> 00:34:53.361]  Thank you.
[00:34:53.381 --> 00:34:54.422]  Call back some other time.
[00:34:55.777 --> 00:34:56.318]  We're good to go.
[00:34:56.338 --> 00:34:56.758]  We're good to go.
[00:35:11.299 --> 00:35:13.480]  And see, they have to cheat.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.782]  They can't fight on a level playing field.
[00:35:16.802 --> 00:35:18.042]  They have to create the illusion.
[00:35:18.362 --> 00:35:26.066]  And if it's fake left or fake right, they allow that false contained, limited, false paradigm discussion.
[00:35:27.166 --> 00:35:28.147]  It's a facsimile.
[00:35:28.347 --> 00:35:28.927]  It's limited.
[00:35:28.967 --> 00:35:29.647]  It's not real.
[00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:32.589]  But I've called right back in a minute later.
[00:35:32.609 --> 00:35:35.530]  I've even done this in front of my wife on a road trip.
[00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.250]  She started laughing.
[00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.031]  And I just call in and go, Yeah?
[00:35:39.782 --> 00:35:48.805]  I just don't like the president, and I just think what he's doing is despicable, and he's just doing a terrible job.
[00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:50.006]  Well, sir, hold on.
[00:35:50.186 --> 00:35:50.986]  Please don't hang up.
[00:35:51.186 --> 00:35:52.567]  We're going to go right to you, okay?
[00:35:52.587 --> 00:35:53.307]  And then you're on.
[00:35:53.347 --> 00:36:08.572]  They skip you right past the other people, Houston, San Antonio Radio, and some of the local stuff I've called into, and then I get on the air, and I say, yes, and the host will hang up on you in ten seconds and go, you know, you lied to our call screener.
[00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:11.431]  Lied?
[00:36:11.511 --> 00:36:12.232]  No, I didn't lie.
[00:36:12.272 --> 00:36:13.273]  I just acted stupid.
[00:36:13.293 --> 00:36:16.094]  Because you want stupid people to disagree with you.
[00:36:16.575 --> 00:36:18.296]  Because you can't have a real debate.
[00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:19.817]  You've got to cheat.
[00:36:21.037 --> 00:36:21.938]  We don't do that here.
[00:36:23.039 --> 00:36:26.541]  If you disagree with me, if you disagree with me,
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:30.161]  You go to the head of the line.
[00:36:30.561 --> 00:36:32.723]  And we're on all these AM and FM stations.
[00:36:33.103 --> 00:36:39.928]  From California to upstate New York to Texas to Illinois to Indiana, Florida.
[00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:41.890]  And there are people out there listening.
[00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.711]  And I know some of you disagree.
[00:36:43.751 --> 00:36:44.492]  It's a minority.
[00:36:44.592 --> 00:36:45.632]  But you send me emails.
[00:36:46.633 --> 00:36:47.794]  I need to be killed.
[00:36:47.814 --> 00:36:49.755]  I need to be put in a prison camp.
[00:36:49.855 --> 00:36:50.516]  I'm a traitor.
[00:36:50.596 --> 00:36:51.437]  I'm a communist.
[00:36:52.157 --> 00:36:53.078]  On and on and on.
[00:36:54.058 --> 00:36:54.519]  Okay.
[00:36:55.199 --> 00:36:56.080]  Call into the show.
[00:36:56.696 --> 00:36:59.357]  And I've gotten better about not screaming at you or laughing at you.
[00:36:59.377 --> 00:37:02.197]  I mean, don't expect me to be nice to you, though.
[00:37:02.757 --> 00:37:03.158]  Come on.
[00:37:03.578 --> 00:37:05.178]  What do I have to do to entice you to call in?
[00:37:05.198 --> 00:37:05.258]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:05.278 --> 00:37:05.338]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:37:05.358 --> 00:37:09.879]  I was on Kelby J last weekend, and every week I get about, on average, maybe two callers.
[00:37:23.388 --> 00:37:25.930]  Most shows it's one, but I've had some shows with three or four call in.
[00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.872]  And I can take 20 calls, and maybe one of them disagrees.
[00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:30.954]  And it's always just, you're a liar.
[00:37:30.994 --> 00:37:32.615]  There's no Operation Northwoods.
[00:37:32.915 --> 00:37:34.216]  There's no world government.
[00:37:35.417 --> 00:37:40.221]  We're not openly spraying viruses on the meat at these slaughterhouses.
[00:37:41.322 --> 00:37:44.064]  There is no FEMA camps.
[00:37:46.566 --> 00:37:47.507]  I'm Chicken Little.
[00:37:47.607 --> 00:37:48.527]  I'm a liar.
[00:37:49.048 --> 00:37:50.169]  On and on and on.
[00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:52.611]  And so...
[00:37:55.091 --> 00:37:55.651]  Here I am.
[00:37:55.671 --> 00:38:04.416]  I remember the folks at KLBJ 590, which is a marquee station, one of the top five talk stations in the country, wins national awards routinely.
[00:38:04.796 --> 00:38:07.538]  And this year it was in the top five of the best talk stations in the country.
[00:38:07.938 --> 00:38:14.001]  And that big national award thing they had up at the big radio convention they just had in Dallas a few weeks ago.
[00:38:14.561 --> 00:38:15.622]  They got, what, fifth place?
[00:38:16.902 --> 00:38:18.463]  Or was it fourth place?
[00:38:18.523 --> 00:38:18.903]  I forget.
[00:38:19.924 --> 00:38:22.866]  But they said, well, we think you're going to get a lot of people disagreeing.
[00:38:22.886 --> 00:38:23.606]  And I said, no, I'm not.
[00:38:25.037 --> 00:38:28.000]  But I said, we'll put them in front of the line, but I'm not going to get it.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.501]  And it hasn't happened.
[00:38:30.982 --> 00:38:31.803]  And I don't know why.
[00:38:31.923 --> 00:38:33.364]  I mean, ten years ago, it was great.
[00:38:33.404 --> 00:38:36.947]  I could have half the lines disagreeing with me, but I really do, I guess, know the reason why.
[00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.249]  We've convinced most people.
[00:38:38.309 --> 00:38:40.831]  Most people have already heard the things I tell them.
[00:38:41.071 --> 00:38:43.073]  Most people have already learned what I'm telling them.
[00:38:43.093 --> 00:38:45.955]  Most people already know instinctively, and you're not stupid, you're smart.
[00:38:46.156 --> 00:38:46.996]  You're real smart.
[00:38:48.137 --> 00:38:52.281]  You have just lied to yourselves and been in denial, and so I don't teach you anything.
[00:38:53.727 --> 00:39:03.095]  I simply get you to look in the mirror, to look inside yourself, to look inside your brain, inside your consciousness, inside your soul, inside your intellect, and go, you know what, this is true.
[00:39:04.636 --> 00:39:05.017]  That's all.
[00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:06.518]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:39:06.798 --> 00:39:07.739]  That's all I'm doing.
[00:39:08.039 --> 00:39:09.901]  And I don't put a pretty picture on it.
[00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:10.781]  I don't spin it.
[00:39:11.102 --> 00:39:15.565]  In fact, I don't even expand on it.
[00:39:15.685 --> 00:39:17.567]  I don't downgrade what I'm saying.
[00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:18.768]  I don't upgrade what I'm saying.
[00:39:19.927 --> 00:39:26.289]  But if you really had to look at it at the end of the day, I probably do downgrade it a bit just because I don't have words to describe how bad it is.
[00:39:26.669 --> 00:39:29.110]  It's as bad as you can imagine and then some, okay?
[00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.211]  You've heard that saying, it's true.
[00:39:32.691 --> 00:39:37.193]  Whatever you can think of that's feasible, they're doing it, okay?
[00:39:37.853 --> 00:39:38.713]  I've learned that.
[00:39:39.554 --> 00:39:49.277]  I have spent 14 years studying this, probably about 14 hours a day on average.
[00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.934]  The last few years, 16 hours a day, but I'm averaging that out in my mind, giving you a dead reckoning estimate.
[00:39:56.455 --> 00:39:59.637]  Because, you know, 14 years ago, I studied about 3 or 4 hours a day.
[00:39:59.657 --> 00:40:03.700]  12 years ago, I studied about 6 hours a day and fought at 6 hours a day.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.782]  10 years ago, I fought at about 10 hours a day.
[00:40:06.802 --> 00:40:10.645]  5 years ago, I fought at about 14 hours a day.
[00:40:11.145 --> 00:40:13.087]  And now I fight at about 16 hours a day.
[00:40:13.107 --> 00:40:14.388]  Lately, I've kind of backed off a bit.
[00:40:16.351 --> 00:40:17.793]  And again, I'm not here talking about myself.
[00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:21.917]  It's just a microcosm of the world and what I've studied and what I've learned.
[00:40:23.178 --> 00:40:26.381]  So if you disagree with me, you go to the head of the line.
[00:40:27.022 --> 00:40:36.732]  The only thing that can trump somebody who disagrees is someone who disagrees and is calling from a foreign country on their own dime.
[00:40:38.234 --> 00:40:46.719]  And the only thing that can trump that is someone pulled over by the police at the time, having them bust in their car, or having their children snatched at the time.
[00:40:46.759 --> 00:40:47.760]  We've had that many times.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.683]  Or having their ranch taken at the time, or having their farm taken at the time they're on the line.
[00:40:53.124 --> 00:40:56.866]  That goes, and that's rare every few, maybe twice a year.
[00:40:57.386 --> 00:40:59.488]  That is like a royal flush.
[00:41:00.088 --> 00:41:01.749]  You go directly to the head of the line.
[00:41:02.169 --> 00:41:03.250]  You go directly on air.
[00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.693]  And behind all of that is first-time callers, and then behind all of that is regular callers.
[00:41:10.454 --> 00:41:14.478]  So we want to give first-time callers and people who disagree a chance today.
[00:41:14.498 --> 00:41:16.580]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.785]  And I really should preface that.
[00:41:22.805 --> 00:41:28.070]  By first-time caller, I mean people who are first-time callers or folks that call every few months, or people who can never get through.
[00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.014]  All right, let me...
[00:41:35.442 --> 00:41:37.523]  Let me do this right now.
[00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:39.763]  And then we'll get into North Korea.
[00:41:39.783 --> 00:41:41.884]  Then we've got two incredible Keith Oberman clips.
[00:41:41.904 --> 00:41:45.125]  This guy just gets more and more amazing by the day.
[00:41:45.145 --> 00:41:50.527]  He had a piece a few nights ago titled, Why Habeas Corpus Hates America.
[00:41:50.547 --> 00:41:55.248]  He had another one, Rumsfeld Armed North Korea with Nukes.
[00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:01.870]  And oh, the liberal media is, oh, it was discovered by Keith Oberman that they gave him nukes.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.602]  It was discovered by the Swiss papers, the British papers, the U.S.
[00:42:05.642 --> 00:42:05.902]  papers.
[00:42:05.962 --> 00:42:06.963]  It's all old news.
[00:42:07.343 --> 00:42:12.266]  We've been beating, I mean, it's in Paul Watson's book, Water Out of Chaos, out for almost four years.
[00:42:13.647 --> 00:42:14.228]  It's old news.
[00:42:15.068 --> 00:42:15.689]  I didn't break it.
[00:42:15.749 --> 00:42:16.409]  Oberman didn't break it.
[00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:17.009]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.570]  It's public in plain view.
[00:42:19.351 --> 00:42:26.856]  The reactors, the missile secrets, the MIRV technology, the fissile material, all of it, our government or its surrogates.
[00:42:28.641 --> 00:42:33.907]  But they're not a problem, threatening to nuke us again, openly saying they will destroy U.S.
[00:42:33.947 --> 00:42:34.347]  cities.
[00:42:39.653 --> 00:42:42.856]  Nothing, no sanctions, nothing by this criminal government.
[00:42:43.777 --> 00:42:50.284]  But the task forces are mashing to blow Iran off the map, and the good old boys are all going to go to the liquor store and...
[00:42:50.911 --> 00:42:52.832]  Go get a big bucket of fried chicken.
[00:42:52.972 --> 00:42:57.275]  Again, I talked to a friend who owns a liquor store, and he said, I said, let me guess, when are your record sales?
[00:42:57.295 --> 00:42:59.216]  I already could just intuitively know.
[00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:00.677]  Just common sense.
[00:43:01.157 --> 00:43:02.979]  I said, when do you sell the most alcohol?
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.922]  This was about six months after the war started in 2003, so it was still fresh in his mind.
[00:43:08.942 --> 00:43:11.724]  If you ask him today, they probably won't remember, you know, on average.
[00:43:11.944 --> 00:43:15.126]  So I asked another liquor store owner, who I didn't know.
[00:43:15.166 --> 00:43:16.207]  I just walked in and asked him.
[00:43:17.608 --> 00:43:18.008]  And, uh,
[00:43:18.931 --> 00:43:38.448]  They said, on the eve of the war, in the first few days of the war, and I talked to somebody I know who runs a pizza place, I talked to somebody I know who's a manager at a chicken place, and they said it's just people stumbling around with buckets of chicken, people running and grabbing huge tankards of Jack Daniels.
[00:43:38.848 --> 00:43:43.532]  It's just manliness, just rolling around in their homes, getting falling down drunk.
[00:43:44.548 --> 00:43:56.355]  And I've got to tell you, folks, I have actually sat with family I visited while they drink whiskey, while they drink whiskey, watching the war.
[00:43:58.216 --> 00:43:59.377]  I mean, it is religious.
[00:43:59.977 --> 00:44:03.779]  Guzzling whiskey, watching the military channel.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:06.541]  Hoorah!
[00:44:08.502 --> 00:44:08.782]  Okay?
[00:44:09.588 --> 00:44:23.538]  I have visited family, and you walk in the front door, and they're trying to give you big glasses of whiskey on ice, and you sit there for three hours with them, and you eat dinner at their table with a big screen TV on, just talking about how we need to turn it all into a glass parking lot.
[00:44:26.881 --> 00:44:28.002]  And these aren't stupid people.
[00:44:28.062 --> 00:44:29.903]  This is what America has turned into.
[00:44:34.449 --> 00:44:35.471]  I'm digressing again.
[00:44:35.592 --> 00:44:37.555]  Here is Stan Jones, libertarian for U.S.
[00:44:37.575 --> 00:44:38.437]  Senate out of Montana.
[00:44:38.457 --> 00:44:39.379]  We're going to get him on the show.
[00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:40.181]  We need to support him.
[00:44:40.979 --> 00:44:43.540]  He shouldn't have prefaced it with, this sounds like a conspiracy theorist.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:50.523]  He should have just said, the elite have told us it's a conspiracy theory, and they do that to neutralize us, but this is the facts, this is reality.
[00:44:50.803 --> 00:44:52.303]  And he also keeps calling it communism.
[00:44:52.683 --> 00:44:57.785]  Communism is only one manifestation and one cloaking device of this crime syndicate.
[00:44:58.186 --> 00:45:07.229]  They have to have a false bipolar world so they'll control two sides and play off the two sides against each other, but really the fight is against the indigenous populations, it's against the people.
[00:45:08.226 --> 00:45:15.072]  As Orwell told you, as Machiavelli told you, as the Roman historians told you, as common sense in history dictates.
[00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:19.495]  This war is against the people drinking the whiskey, watching the military channel.
[00:45:20.136 --> 00:45:21.577]  You're under attack, okay?
[00:45:21.597 --> 00:45:30.645]  There are people with 180 IQs, literally, inside high computer systems with advanced modeling, AI technologies, figuring out how to brainwash you.
[00:45:31.045 --> 00:45:32.306]  You're the target, Bubba.
[00:45:33.445 --> 00:45:35.767]  How to sell the public on eugenics.
[00:45:36.027 --> 00:45:39.570]  How to sell them on sterilization.
[00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:45.994]  How to sell them on the hemlock society on killing you.
[00:45:48.156 --> 00:45:50.398]  On you being killed when you go to the hospital when you're sick.
[00:45:50.738 --> 00:45:53.080]  On getting rid of you after you've served your usefulness.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.981]  You're the target.
[00:45:55.482 --> 00:45:56.302]  Don't you understand?
[00:45:56.342 --> 00:45:57.423]  You've been brainwashed.
[00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:59.370]  This is not our government!
[00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.691]  It's been totally taken over since 1947 with the National Security Act.
[00:46:04.271 --> 00:46:05.671]  That is when they got their foothold.
[00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:08.392]  Then they totally took over completely in 63.
[00:46:08.772 --> 00:46:09.612]  That is the government.
[00:46:09.872 --> 00:46:13.033]  Now they're totally taking over the entire society, the whole system.
[00:46:15.413 --> 00:46:18.614]  Here is Stanton Jones on C-SPAN nationally last night.
[00:46:18.634 --> 00:46:20.434]  This is on jonesreport.com right now.
[00:46:20.454 --> 00:46:21.414]  You can watch the video of it.
[00:46:21.434 --> 00:46:21.854]  Here it is.
[00:46:22.414 --> 00:46:24.615]  I wish to thank the sponsors for inviting me.
[00:46:24.635 --> 00:46:26.515]  I don't often get invited.
[00:46:30.312 --> 00:46:31.772]  This was an important debate.
[00:46:33.433 --> 00:46:37.654]  I had planned another closing message, but I feel compelled to say what I'm about to say.
[00:46:38.414 --> 00:46:44.596]  Now I risk sounding like a conspiracy theorist, but it's no longer a theory.
[00:46:45.816 --> 00:46:47.356]  What I'm about to say is fact.
[00:46:48.737 --> 00:46:52.398]  The secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret.
[00:46:53.338 --> 00:46:57.479]  They have planned and are now leading us into a one world communist government.
[00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.292]  The combining of national government started with the European Union.
[00:47:02.893 --> 00:47:16.142]  That union started with trade agreements, then a common currency, the Euro, and now a European Parliament that is feverishly passing laws that override the laws of the member nations.
[00:47:17.923 --> 00:47:23.487]  A constitution was drafted but rejected by a few of those nations, but never mind.
[00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:26.049]  They implemented it anyway.
[00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:28.771]  Now it's North America's turn.
[00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:39.686]  Building on the North American Free Trade Agreement, the NAFTA section of the Commerce Department is busy drafting laws and regulations for a North American union.
[00:47:40.907 --> 00:47:43.009]  A union of Canada, America and Mexico.
[00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:51.377]  The President has attended secret meetings and signed at least two agreements under the Security and Prosperity Partnership Program.
[00:47:52.518 --> 00:47:55.841]  Information leaked out about the meetings and now it is all in the open.
[00:47:56.892 --> 00:48:00.456]  No treaty has been signed, so Congress has not become involved.
[00:48:01.216 --> 00:48:05.300]  However, money from our treasury is now being spent for this effort.
[00:48:06.501 --> 00:48:14.269]  We will have a new currency, the Emeril, and a new Constitution, modeled on the Soviet Union's Constitution.
[00:48:15.149 --> 00:48:20.955]  Our rights will not be inalienable, but they will be granted by government, who can also take them away.
[00:48:22.782 --> 00:48:29.788]  One sign that this is our future is the plans for the superhighways from southern Mexico through America and into Canada.
[00:48:30.688 --> 00:48:32.470]  These plans are not secret any longer.
[00:48:33.691 --> 00:48:40.376]  Huge amounts of property will be taken in the name of free trade, peace, and security.
[00:48:41.877 --> 00:48:46.401]  You will have a national ID card with a radio frequency chip in it.
[00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:51.780]  That's already law in America and will be implemented by May 2000.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.401]  This man voted for it.
[00:48:55.641 --> 00:48:57.802]  You will not be able to move about freely.
[00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:02.063]  This is terrorism of the most worst kind.
[00:49:03.103 --> 00:49:04.723]  Brought on you by our own government.
[00:49:06.004 --> 00:49:12.125]  The strongest, freest nation in the history of mankind will be averaged into world communism.
[00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:14.646]  Is that what you want?
[00:49:15.726 --> 00:49:18.189]  Are we the people still in control of this nation?
[00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.112]  We must begin to act like we are.
[00:49:21.132 --> 00:49:22.914]  Stan Jones.
[00:49:23.895 --> 00:49:24.956]  On that, Conrad Burns.
[00:49:25.036 --> 00:49:25.496]  Three minutes.
[00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:29.901]  Sure glad you got such a rosy outlook on our future for our kids.
[00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:32.564]  Hey, did you hear the scumbag?
[00:49:33.926 --> 00:49:36.108]  I forget if that's a Republican or a Democrat he was debating.
[00:49:36.728 --> 00:49:40.552]  Oh, you see, his answer is, I'm glad you got such a rosy eye to look.
[00:49:40.772 --> 00:49:43.734]  See how he talks?
[00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:45.376]  That's why I talk like that.
[00:49:45.616 --> 00:49:47.517]  They're the ones killing this country.
[00:49:47.978 --> 00:49:49.459]  They're not good country boys.
[00:49:49.499 --> 00:49:50.660]  They're not good Americans.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.341]  They're not good Montanans.
[00:49:52.381 --> 00:49:54.303]  They're fake buckets of pus.
[00:49:55.744 --> 00:49:57.966]  Everything Stan Jones said was true.
[00:49:59.019 --> 00:50:00.080]  It's all happening.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:00.680]  It's done.
[00:50:01.021 --> 00:50:01.941]  But what's his answer?
[00:50:02.322 --> 00:50:05.904]  These minions decide to decide it doesn't exist.
[00:50:06.385 --> 00:50:11.489]  They make a conscious decision to just say, You've got a negative outlook, don't you, boy?
[00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.751]  The country's dying, scum!
[00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:21.376]  And all people want to do is go get big bottles of whiskey and go watch the military channel.
[00:50:23.678 --> 00:50:27.061]  I support the troops breathing new year, taking deadly vaccines.
[00:50:27.853 --> 00:50:28.854]  That's how you're a patriot.
[00:50:28.874 --> 00:50:32.356]  I'm going to stick a plastic flag made by slaves on my car.
[00:50:35.498 --> 00:50:36.539]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:45.724]  If you're a real American, a real Montanan, a real Texan, a real New Yorker, you'll join us in fighting the scum.
[00:50:45.744 --> 00:50:52.889]  And if you think I'm weird for getting mad over my country dying, there's something wrong with you and I want to punch you upside the head.
[00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:54.810]  I want to knock your teeth out.
[00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.111]  You want to know what I think of you?
[00:51:04.642 --> 00:51:07.803]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.163 --> 00:51:10.063]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.463 --> 00:51:18.125]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.805 --> 00:51:25.826]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.247 --> 00:51:29.187]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[00:51:29.567 --> 00:51:31.868]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.308 --> 00:51:33.128]  NSA spies.
[00:51:33.621 --> 00:51:37.703]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.984 --> 00:51:41.466]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.966 --> 00:51:43.847]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.207 --> 00:51:48.130]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:21.009]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:52:21.269 --> 00:52:22.530]  To below detectable levels.
[00:52:22.831 --> 00:52:26.774]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:26.995 --> 00:52:33.581]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:33.821 --> 00:52:39.326]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:39.566 --> 00:52:46.493]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:52:46.613 --> 00:52:48.375]  The Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.

[00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:04.854]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:08.720]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.768 --> 00:54:17.111]  Waging war on corruption, crashing into lies and disinformation.
[00:54:17.471 --> 00:54:21.193]  Your call's coming up in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:21.513 --> 00:54:27.157]  We'll also, early in the next hour, re-air my little confrontation with John Ashcroft yesterday.
[00:54:27.177 --> 00:54:31.900]  Because I know we aired it at the end of the show because we hadn't even gotten it yet until the end of the show.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:35.021]  And a lot of you weren't able to listen to the full three hours to catch it.
[00:54:35.442 --> 00:54:38.724]  So we'll play that coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:38.824 --> 00:54:40.485]  Also, two incredible Keith Oberman...
[00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:42.546]  I think we're good to go.
[00:54:42.566 --> 00:54:43.486]  I think we're good to go.
[00:55:09.009 --> 00:55:13.152]  But I didn't write them down, and then I get on the air, and I'm like, there's all these things I want to say, and I don't have the notes.
[00:55:13.473 --> 00:55:24.140]  I'm writing notes during the break, just about the true nature of the New World Order, about their true plan, about what life will be like, about how fast technology is accelerating.
[00:55:25.642 --> 00:55:26.682]  This is not my opinion.
[00:55:26.722 --> 00:55:27.543]  This is their plan.
[00:55:27.563 --> 00:55:28.744]  This is what's being done.
[00:55:28.764 --> 00:55:33.267]  And I always say I'm going to get into this, and I never do properly, because I spend 30 minutes on it.
[00:55:35.706 --> 00:55:36.686]  I want to write a book about it.
[00:55:36.706 --> 00:55:37.786]  I want to make a film about it.
[00:55:37.806 --> 00:55:40.147]  But how do you get into all of the little minutia of it?
[00:55:40.627 --> 00:55:41.387]  But that's coming up.
[00:55:43.787 --> 00:55:45.308]  And listen, I do get mad.
[00:55:45.448 --> 00:56:00.370]  I'm sick of fakes who have their cars painted up like American flags, who strut around with George W. stickers everywhere, who will argue with me, who will get in my face, who will send me emails, who will flip us off at events.
[00:56:01.711 --> 00:56:04.411]  They're the most dangerous type of people.
[00:56:05.473 --> 00:56:07.094]  Because they mean well, folks.
[00:56:07.814 --> 00:56:10.915]  I love America and we should kill whoever we want.
[00:56:12.356 --> 00:56:13.796]  And they just don't know.
[00:56:14.797 --> 00:56:15.877]  They don't know.
[00:56:15.897 --> 00:56:16.897]  They're stupid.
[00:56:17.818 --> 00:56:19.618]  And the liberals, they mean well.
[00:56:20.199 --> 00:56:22.820]  But they don't know how they've been conditioned or brainwashed.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:28.522]  I mean, the liberals are big on the eugenics and the social Darwinism and the master plan.
[00:56:29.102 --> 00:56:30.623]  And they're going to be getting into office now.
[00:56:30.663 --> 00:56:31.363]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:31.423 --> 00:56:33.884]  It's like we're being thrown from one latrine to the next.
[00:56:35.991 --> 00:56:37.071]  We're in so much trouble.
[00:56:37.271 --> 00:56:47.213]  I'm working on getting that guest tomorrow who was inside Singapore and saw a lot of secretive stuff.
[00:56:48.073 --> 00:56:51.894]  You want to know what life's going to be like in just five, six years here.
[00:56:52.374 --> 00:56:53.534]  It's already going on there.
[00:56:54.574 --> 00:56:55.254]  Heaven help us.
[00:56:55.675 --> 00:57:03.796]  Before we end this hour, if you believe in what we're doing, if you believe in this fight, then you need to join us in that fight.
[00:57:04.807 --> 00:57:10.871]  You need to step up to the plate, and you need to get my new film, Terror Storm, and you need to make copies of it.
[00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:12.452]  You need to give it to people.
[00:57:12.492 --> 00:57:13.392]  You can afford it.
[00:57:13.412 --> 00:57:16.754]  You need to buy a whole bunch of the original, high-quality, original DVDs from us.
[00:57:17.435 --> 00:57:18.215]  Give them as gifts.
[00:57:19.996 --> 00:57:21.117]  Sell them at your church.
[00:57:21.157 --> 00:57:24.199]  Sell them at your store, your truck stop, your vegetable stand.
[00:57:24.639 --> 00:57:25.399]  Give them to folks.
[00:57:25.559 --> 00:57:26.080]  I don't care.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:26.760]  Make copies.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:33.224]  Terror Storm, my new film exposing 9-11 as an inside job, 7-7, the Madrid bombings,
[00:57:34.128 --> 00:57:37.931]  The Iraq War, the torture, the surveillance, the brainwashing.
[00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:39.532]  It's an incredible film.
[00:57:39.952 --> 00:57:41.072]  Terror Storm.
[00:57:42.794 --> 00:57:49.598]  With 68 minutes of extras from the 9-11 neocon agenda symposium we had out in L.A., the highlights of that two-day conference in 68 minutes.
[00:57:49.878 --> 00:57:50.538]  It's powerful.
[00:57:51.999 --> 00:57:53.520]  On one DVD over three hours.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.021]  Get 9-11 demolitions.
[00:57:56.042 --> 00:57:58.383]  Get 9-11 mysteries demolitions that we're carrying.
[00:57:58.443 --> 00:57:59.644]  Amazing film.

[00:58:02.515 --> 00:58:04.217]  Loose Change 2nd Edition we carry.
[00:58:04.277 --> 00:58:04.918]  Amazing.
[00:58:04.978 --> 00:58:07.120]  Don't just watch a cruddy online clip.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.683]  It's cruddy compared to the actual DVD.
[00:58:12.266 --> 00:58:12.746]  Support us.
[00:58:12.786 --> 00:58:13.347]  Support them.
[00:58:13.387 --> 00:58:14.068]  Get the word out.
[00:58:14.688 --> 00:58:15.670]  They let you make copies of it.
[00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:17.692]  They ask you to of Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.591]  Infowars.com to order.
[00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:26.495]  Infowars.com or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:58:36.982 --> 00:58:37.742]  Expose them.
[00:58:38.022 --> 00:58:39.283]  They're becoming afraid.
[00:58:41.324 --> 00:58:45.987]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.802 --> 00:58:58.463]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.123 --> 00:59:00.184]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.885 --> 00:59:01.986]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.666 --> 00:59:03.467]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.227 --> 00:59:05.128]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:09.612]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.972 --> 00:59:14.095]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.442 --> 00:59:24.103]  I'm just an average Texan.
[00:59:24.881 --> 00:59:31.447]  An American who already knew a lot about history and in college learned they were setting up a world government openly.
[00:59:31.467 --> 00:59:37.913]  They were openly announcing it in scholarly publications, governmental documents, U.S.
[00:59:37.953 --> 00:59:40.295]  government, Russian government, U.N.
[00:59:40.335 --> 00:59:42.177]  government, British government, French government.
[00:59:42.217 --> 00:59:43.278]  And then I'd watch singing in.
[00:59:43.298 --> 00:59:44.739]  They'd say, there's no world government.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:46.121]  Dangerous crazies.
[00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:46.741]  Talk about it.
[00:59:47.462 --> 00:59:48.263]  And I went, wait a minute.
[00:59:48.283 --> 00:59:49.504]  They're teaching us world government.
[00:59:49.544 --> 00:59:50.645]  It's in all these documents.
[00:59:51.627 --> 01:00:01.353]  But then when the common folk talk about it, the media says they're probably connected to terrorists and probably connected to the OKC bomber and connected to Waco.
[01:00:01.393 --> 01:00:05.095]  And I said, you know, I better investigate this a little bit.
[01:00:06.276 --> 01:00:09.658]  So I've been taking action since right after the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:00:09.698 --> 01:00:13.821]  I was already aware of the New World Order then, but really took action right after it in late 1995.
[01:00:13.921 --> 01:00:16.502]  And here I am.
[01:00:19.742 --> 01:00:22.004]  All those years later after fighting the New World Order.
[01:00:23.545 --> 01:00:24.986]  And it's all coming down on us.
[01:00:25.026 --> 01:00:28.128]  And a lot of people have woken up because everything we talked about has come true.
[01:00:30.189 --> 01:00:32.711]  And North Korea again threatened to nuke us yesterday.
[01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:33.592]  We're going to cover that.
[01:00:34.893 --> 01:00:36.494]  Meanwhile, the neocons don't care about that.
[01:00:36.514 --> 01:00:37.334]  They say, no problem.
[01:00:37.354 --> 01:00:40.176]  We need to go into Iran and now.
[01:00:40.556 --> 01:00:42.358]  And the carrier task forces are massing.
[01:00:42.798 --> 01:00:44.299]  Everyone's focusing on the Eisenhower.
[01:00:44.319 --> 01:00:47.081]  There are two other carriers in strike distance right now.
[01:00:51.696 --> 01:00:56.059]  Meanwhile, you've got Foley Gates spinning out of control with all the perverts in Congress.
[01:00:58.061 --> 01:01:00.303]  We've got all this news today we're going to be covering.
[01:01:00.363 --> 01:01:09.329]  Bizarre police state news as things get crazier and crazier as the schools, the businesses, the streets, the malls of America are turned into many prisons.
[01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.952]  The entire Bill of Rights is disappearing, overthrown.
[01:01:16.855 --> 01:01:18.136]  The borders are dissolving.
[01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:20.312]  It's upon us.
[01:01:20.412 --> 01:01:21.693]  The New World Order is upon us.
[01:01:21.773 --> 01:01:22.414]  It isn't coming.
[01:01:22.994 --> 01:01:24.556]  It isn't over the hill and down the dale.
[01:01:25.217 --> 01:01:25.577]  It's here.
[01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:26.838]  We're in it right now.
[01:01:26.918 --> 01:01:29.320]  We have penetrated enemy lines.
[01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:31.082]  We are now inside the New World Order.
[01:01:31.643 --> 01:01:32.704]  We have been overrun.
[01:01:32.724 --> 01:01:34.365]  And I say good.
[01:01:34.405 --> 01:01:35.006]  We're surrounded.
[01:01:35.026 --> 01:01:35.967]  Don't let any of them escape.
[01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:37.501]  We're good to go.
[01:02:04.386 --> 01:02:05.387]  And get her done.
[01:02:05.507 --> 01:02:08.869]  Don't, oh, thank you, Alex, for your fight against the New World Order.
[01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:09.890]  Oh, thank you, thank you.
[01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:17.896]  Hey, listen, I don't want you, while I'm in the trenches, firing at the enemy, and they're coming over the trenches, into the trenches, and I'm busy bayonetting the enemy.
[01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:22.139]  I don't want you, frankly, coming over and hugging me, telling me what a great job.
[01:02:22.159 --> 01:02:24.361]  Just please, please, we're being overrun!
[01:02:24.381 --> 01:02:26.262]  Listen, keep your eye on the enemy!
[01:02:29.515 --> 01:02:35.497]  And I frankly don't need the latest gossip on what's going on inside the Patriot or Truth Community with the Cohen-Kelpro people trying to get us to end fight.
[01:02:36.497 --> 01:02:38.038]  I frankly just need to stay on target.
[01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:40.479]  Stay on target.
[01:02:42.199 --> 01:02:45.840]  Coming up after this break, I'm going to play the Ashcroft clip, briefly comment on it.
[01:02:46.541 --> 01:02:48.681]  It aired at the end of the show yesterday when we first got it.
[01:02:49.262 --> 01:02:53.403]  I confronted him in the early morning, but Man Cal's radio show didn't get us the clip until...
[01:02:54.574 --> 01:02:56.375]  The radio show Ashcroft was on that I was on.
[01:02:56.895 --> 01:02:58.817]  Didn't get it to us until about 20 minutes at the end of the show.
[01:02:58.877 --> 01:02:59.697]  So a lot of you didn't hear it.
[01:02:59.717 --> 01:03:00.758]  A lot of you have been requesting it.
[01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:05.721]  We're going to play that clip coming up here in the next segment.
[01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:06.721]  It's just three minutes long.
[01:03:07.142 --> 01:03:14.446]  Then we'll go to Andrew in Australia, David in North Carolina, Danny in Florida, Leo in Illinois, Joe in Canada, and many others.
[01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:20.630]  We've got two incredible Oberlin clips from the last two days coming up from MSNBC.
[01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:21.530]  Really proud of him.
[01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:22.351]  He is on fire.
[01:03:23.573 --> 01:03:25.394]  We'll cover North Korea's threats to Nukes.
[01:03:26.614 --> 01:03:29.436]  Can't let yourself get desensitized by the monthly threat.
[01:03:30.536 --> 01:03:32.257]  This illustrates something essential.
[01:03:33.337 --> 01:03:36.159]  Paramount to understand the geopolitical structure.
[01:03:37.579 --> 01:03:38.880]  So it's all coming up.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.481]  Wide open phones for the next two hours.
[01:03:42.101 --> 01:03:45.743]  I canceled guests again because I want to have a chance to let you get involved on air.
[01:03:45.763 --> 01:03:48.464]  We always enjoy your informative input.
[01:03:49.064 --> 01:03:50.005]  Scrap yourselves in.
[01:03:50.025 --> 01:03:50.585]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.474 --> 01:03:59.676]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.016 --> 01:04:01.957]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.318 --> 01:04:09.982]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.663 --> 01:04:17.707]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.107 --> 01:04:21.049]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.429 --> 01:04:23.750]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.191 --> 01:04:24.971]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.578 --> 01:04:28.839]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.021]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.221 --> 01:04:54.941]  Terrorism.
[01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:55.902]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:55.982 --> 01:04:56.643]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.723 --> 01:04:57.163]  Fallout.
[01:04:57.243 --> 01:04:58.224]  Biological attack.
[01:04:58.404 --> 01:04:58.944]  Anthrax.
[01:04:59.024 --> 01:05:01.126]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:01.386 --> 01:05:02.988]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:03.228 --> 01:05:05.710]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:20.681]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.701 --> 01:05:21.021]  government.
[01:05:21.202 --> 01:05:22.963]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.363 --> 01:05:29.288]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.408 --> 01:05:33.912]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:05:34.172 --> 01:05:41.598]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:41.618 --> 01:05:43.580]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:55.832]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:55.933 --> 01:05:58.314]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:05:58.374 --> 01:06:04.558]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:06.038 --> 01:06:08.340]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.542]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:13.082 --> 01:06:17.225]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:17.785 --> 01:06:20.747]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:24.652]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:25.393 --> 01:06:31.398]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:31.638 --> 01:06:34.480]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:39.304]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[01:06:39.384 --> 01:06:42.307]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:45.549]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:45.609 --> 01:06:49.813]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[01:06:50.153 --> 01:06:51.114]  And ask for George.
[01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:58.550]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:00.271]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.991 --> 01:07:02.171]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.751 --> 01:07:03.572]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:05.172]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.252 --> 01:07:09.834]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.054 --> 01:07:14.176]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.376 --> 01:07:19.498]  All right, the Ashcroft clip is coming up one more time here in just a moment.
[01:07:21.719 --> 01:07:22.939]  Let's talk sociology.
[01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:24.019]  Let's talk psychology.
[01:07:24.059 --> 01:07:25.420]  Let's talk mob psychology.
[01:07:26.428 --> 01:07:52.314]  That energy, that drive, that growl in your soul that was engineered into humanity through time and space, when you go to a UT football game and they make the touchdown in the last three seconds of the game, and when Vince Young does it and you feel exhilarated, you feel like your life means something, you feel like your life is worth something,
[01:07:53.266 --> 01:07:59.731]  Do you know what that worthless, ritualized combat is manipulating?
[01:07:59.751 --> 01:08:00.752]  Do you know what it's triggering?
[01:08:08.413 --> 01:08:20.761]  Off of southern England and 50 guys pile off and come into your village to rape and kill your women and haul your women off and kill you and take your sons.
[01:08:21.322 --> 01:08:31.649]  That exhilaration is the ancient instinct of grabbing your axe or your sword and going berserk and killing five of them and driving them off.
[01:08:33.237 --> 01:08:41.520]  That exhilaration is there so when they chop your arm off, you keep going, because if you don't, they're going to kill your two-year-old.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:47.782]  It has nothing to do with some idiot running across a finish line.
[01:08:50.723 --> 01:08:52.184]  It has zero.
[01:08:52.904 --> 01:08:55.585]  And so when you hear me get all hyped up, and, ooh, man, that's scary.
[01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.165]  That guy shouldn't get so excited.
[01:08:57.426 --> 01:08:58.066]  Baloney.
[01:08:58.326 --> 01:08:59.706]  This is where it's supposed to be.
[01:08:59.966 --> 01:09:01.327]  Do you understand that?
[01:09:03.487 --> 01:09:05.368]  And I get mad about this stuff, folks.
[01:09:05.788 --> 01:09:08.449]  And frankly, I feel very violent.
[01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:21.333]  But I understand the information war is where the power is today, so I focus my violence with a sword of truth against the New World Order buckets of garbage.
[01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.014]  And it's that simple.
[01:09:25.074 --> 01:09:25.434]  And again...
[01:09:28.507 --> 01:09:29.347]  Again, let me be clear.
[01:09:29.507 --> 01:09:31.408]  I am not against somebody like Vince Young.
[01:09:31.448 --> 01:09:34.950]  I'm not even against UT winning the national championship.
[01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:53.978]  The point is to see men turned into shadows of themselves and to see men wearing their tribal burnt orange, to see men basically being... It would be like a man marrying a blow-up doll.
[01:09:55.052 --> 01:10:08.899]  Your manliness being your fan worship of football is like someone being sad that their son never grew up and married a woman and gave them grandchildren, that their son was proud and worshipped their blow-up doll.
[01:10:10.299 --> 01:10:11.740]  That's basically my disgust.
[01:10:13.562 --> 01:10:30.668]  It'd be like if you were a father and a mother, and you had a couple sons, and you were proud of the other two who went off and had children for you and got married and were successful, and you're 70 years old, and you've got this 35-year-old son who just doesn't have his fake wife in the closet that nobody knows about.
[01:10:31.108 --> 01:10:33.029]  He takes her to the restaurant.
[01:10:33.309 --> 01:10:34.829]  He takes her to the country club.
[01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:36.090]  He worships her.
[01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:38.311]  He's proud of a blow-up doll.
[01:10:39.491 --> 01:10:42.052]  Now, I'm sorry, it's the only analogy that fits.
[01:10:43.096 --> 01:10:45.959]  I guess in ranching it's like they have fake cows for bulls.
[01:10:46.839 --> 01:10:49.862]  For stud bulls that you want to then artificially inseminate your cows.
[01:10:50.502 --> 01:10:54.545]  And that's one way is to have the bulls, you know, go mount the fake cow.
[01:10:55.086 --> 01:10:56.187]  That's not how it's done normally.
[01:10:56.207 --> 01:11:00.550]  There's another procedure I won't get into of how you extract that genetic material from a bull.
[01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:04.333]  Because I've worked in that industry for a couple summers.
[01:11:05.754 --> 01:11:11.879]  But to make a long story short, it's pathetic when you watch the bull up there on the fake cow.
[01:11:12.907 --> 01:11:20.872]  And I see these men, these men with their blow-up dolls, walking around smiling, proud of themselves, and I just frankly want to break down and cry.
[01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:30.148]  And if you don't get what I'm saying, we're really getting down here to the way my brain works.
[01:11:30.168 --> 01:11:31.789]  Because I get into sociology.
[01:11:32.109 --> 01:11:33.370]  I get into mob psychology.
[01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:34.811]  I get into what we are.
[01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:36.172]  I don't need to go read a textbook.
[01:11:36.212 --> 01:11:40.435]  Long before I read those textbooks, which I've now read in the last few years, I knew what would be in them.
[01:11:40.835 --> 01:11:42.376]  Because it is the truth, folks.
[01:11:42.756 --> 01:11:45.838]  They don't lie when it comes to this science because they use it to manipulate us.
[01:11:46.199 --> 01:11:52.743]  I instinctively know what I feel and what I am because I've gotten in touch with what it is to be a real live human being.
[01:11:52.923 --> 01:11:54.024]  Nothing special, folks.
[01:11:54.604 --> 01:11:55.805]  I'm basically a caveman.
[01:11:56.605 --> 01:11:56.926]  Okay?
[01:11:57.106 --> 01:12:00.808]  And I am almost immune to their engineering and programming and propaganda.
[01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:04.490]  And you can get there, too.
[01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:06.652]  A lot of you have already gone way past where I'm at.
[01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:23.662]  And so, basically, this ritualized combat, this ritualized warfare, where two football teams or two hockey teams or two basketball teams or two baseball teams come together...
[01:12:25.211 --> 01:12:26.132]  We're good to go.
[01:12:49.423 --> 01:13:00.134]  To get yourself hyped up, and to paint a scary face on you, to get yourself hyped up, to get in the mood to go out and kill people!
[01:13:01.516 --> 01:13:02.897]  To go out and be killed!
[01:13:02.937 --> 01:13:05.340]  To go out and have people drive spears through you!
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.422]  To go out and fight cave bears!
[01:13:08.703 --> 01:13:12.127]  To go out and defend ladies and gentlemen!
[01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:21.096]  You're meant to have this aggressive instinct so you'll get on a sailing ship and circumnavigate the planet like Magellan.
[01:13:21.537 --> 01:13:24.900]  That takes aggression and courage and that drive to survive.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.121]  Why do we always search and quest?
[01:13:27.162 --> 01:13:29.183]  It's a survival mechanism of the species.
[01:13:29.824 --> 01:13:39.993]  And to see your vital instincts misdirected into mindless idiocy that is only a facsimile, a prosthesis...
[01:13:40.865 --> 01:13:41.765]  It's not even a prosthesis.
[01:13:41.805 --> 01:13:43.286]  A prosthesis actually does a job.
[01:13:43.306 --> 01:13:46.168]  That's the improper term.
[01:13:46.728 --> 01:13:51.750]  Again, it is like marrying a blow-up doll.
[01:13:54.011 --> 01:13:55.332]  It's so pathetic.
[01:13:56.895 --> 01:13:59.457]  Men don't talk about how the border's being erased.
[01:13:59.537 --> 01:14:01.238]  Men don't talk about most of them.
[01:14:01.278 --> 01:14:02.159]  Some are real men and do.
[01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:09.825]  About how there's cancer viruses in the vaccines or how the school is taking their children away from them piecemeal or how they're physically doing it.
[01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:12.046]  They don't talk about how we're being treated like slaves.
[01:14:12.507 --> 01:14:13.307]  Real men would.
[01:14:13.327 --> 01:14:15.649]  That's what real men a thousand years ago talked about.
[01:14:15.969 --> 01:14:17.010]  Two thousand years ago.
[01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:18.051]  Three thousand years ago.
[01:14:18.331 --> 01:14:19.972]  Two hundred and thirty years ago.
[01:14:20.413 --> 01:14:22.014]  Men all got around every week.
[01:14:22.454 --> 01:14:26.137]  You know, there at the pub or down by the big tree and they talked about it.
[01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:30.846]  And if they didn't talk about it, their women and children were enslaved.
[01:14:31.406 --> 01:14:36.669]  Because if you don't have the instinct to fight, if you've got the instinct to fight, you're probably going to be enslaved most of the time.
[01:14:36.909 --> 01:14:39.191]  It's just you've got a fighting chance to not be a slave.
[01:14:39.691 --> 01:14:41.312]  If you're a jellyfish, it's over.
[01:14:44.394 --> 01:14:49.257]  And so I get mad because everything about being a man today is sports.
[01:14:50.456 --> 01:14:51.077]  We're good to go.
[01:14:51.097 --> 01:14:52.177]  We're good to go.
[01:15:13.272 --> 01:15:19.214]  And the arrogant, puffed-up football players that as soon as their knees are blown out, no one will care about.
[01:15:19.534 --> 01:15:22.335]  And their weird little worship society cultures.
[01:15:22.415 --> 01:15:27.737]  And they're always busy raping women and drug dealing and gang banging.
[01:15:27.797 --> 01:15:31.258]  And your children are taught that that is manhood.
[01:15:31.938 --> 01:15:34.719]  Your children are taught that that is strength.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.401]  I said I'd go to your calls, and we're going to go to them.
[01:15:42.683 --> 01:15:45.645]  So, I'm just telling you, you can still go to a ball game.
[01:15:46.505 --> 01:15:55.771]  You can still do all these things, but your main anger, that feeling of tribal warfare you have, is there for a reason.
[01:15:56.091 --> 01:15:57.372]  It's meant for defense.
[01:15:58.393 --> 01:16:00.694]  It's meant to explore.
[01:16:01.255 --> 01:16:07.478]  It is not meant to be squandered at a stadium, paying exorbitant prices with a bunch of idiots.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.541]  You've been robbed of real life.
[01:16:12.429 --> 01:16:16.332]  You've been robbed of a real woman.
[01:16:17.794 --> 01:16:24.880]  So if you're going to be into the blow-up doll, just don't bring it out in public and don't show it to me because it makes me sick.
[01:16:27.057 --> 01:16:28.899]  That's basically what your sports are.
[01:16:29.279 --> 01:16:33.022]  You're playing at being a warrior and you're not even on the field.
[01:16:33.383 --> 01:16:42.911]  You're basically like the women back at the cave hoping the men are fighting off the tribe from over the next valley.
[01:16:45.293 --> 01:16:50.238]  And so it's the same exuberance of when your men come in, half of them come back and they're all bleeding.
[01:16:51.488 --> 01:16:52.669]  You know, the survivors.
[01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:57.695]  And they come back and they've beaten off the psycho tribe from over the hill.
[01:16:58.877 --> 01:17:00.679]  And you have this big celebration.
[01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:03.102]  My God, your children aren't going to be enslaved.
[01:17:03.122 --> 01:17:04.884]  You're not going to be raped and taken into captivity.
[01:17:05.124 --> 01:17:06.266]  Your men aren't going to be killed.
[01:17:06.306 --> 01:17:07.367]  Your men fought for you.
[01:17:07.888 --> 01:17:09.009]  Oh, you tend their wounds.
[01:17:09.049 --> 01:17:09.590]  You love them.
[01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:10.591]  You appreciate them.
[01:17:12.913 --> 01:17:18.116]  No, now the men are basically the cave women going and ninnying in the stands.
[01:17:20.958 --> 01:17:21.979]  Oh, you make me sick!
[01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:23.299]  Oh, you make me sick!
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.501]  You've had all your manhood taken away from you!
[01:17:28.763 --> 01:17:29.243]  All of it!
[01:17:30.811 --> 01:17:34.934]  And you tell me I've got a problem because I'm angry.
[01:17:35.435 --> 01:17:55.030]  Because there's an elite openly poisoning us, openly hurting us, openly running one-child policies in China against one-fifth of our population of humanity, openly putting dictators in, openly killing 200-plus million last century, openly saying they're going to do it even bigger this century, putting in a prison grid...
[01:17:55.982 --> 01:18:04.051]  I mean, even a cow who isn't a predator animal, when they start seeing other ones go to the slaughterhouse, they start kicking and bucking and trying to get out.
[01:18:04.672 --> 01:18:08.657]  I mean, even prey animals kick and buck and try to escape.
[01:18:09.357 --> 01:18:12.261]  At the bare minimum, I'm just kicking and bucking here going, grrr, grrr.
[01:18:16.384 --> 01:18:19.966]  Trying to... And then there's a bunch of just mindless lobotomized cows.
[01:18:20.186 --> 01:18:21.007]  Just going, huh?
[01:18:21.327 --> 01:18:21.667]  What?
[01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:23.028]  What'd he say?
[01:18:23.208 --> 01:18:23.989]  He's bad!
[01:18:24.329 --> 01:18:26.270]  He's making a noise!
[01:18:27.091 --> 01:18:31.934]  My master that brings me grain says that if you make a noise, you're bad.
[01:18:32.014 --> 01:18:33.795]  I'm a well-trained slave.
[01:18:34.556 --> 01:18:37.397]  I'm going to go in the squeeze chute so they can slit my throat.
[01:18:37.417 --> 01:18:39.739]  I'll show him.
[01:18:40.059 --> 01:18:41.220]  I'm part of the system.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.701]  I'm a house slave.
[01:18:43.826 --> 01:18:46.709]  We'll play the Ashcroft clip, and I promise, go right to your calls.
[01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:48.952]  I'm in a preaching mood today, folks.
[01:18:49.413 --> 01:18:49.993]  Look out!
[01:18:54.184 --> 01:18:54.765]  Hello, friends.
[01:18:54.825 --> 01:18:56.526]  Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:58.808]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:18:58.928 --> 01:19:06.073]  I mean, real hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:19:06.253 --> 01:19:14.820]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.842]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:19:20.002 --> 01:19:26.645]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:31.188]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.

[01:19:41.773 --> 01:19:44.334]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:19:53.502 --> 01:19:54.743]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:19:54.783 --> 01:19:56.785]  Today is October 11th, 2006.
[01:19:57.246 --> 01:20:03.452]  Gold opened at $574.20 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $605.64.
[01:20:03.652 --> 01:20:06.896]  Again, that's $605.64 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:20:07.396 --> 01:20:10.059]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[01:20:10.559 --> 01:20:15.180]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.981]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[01:20:17.441 --> 01:20:20.582]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[01:20:20.962 --> 01:20:26.423]  We, the people, labor to create the money, only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[01:20:26.803 --> 01:20:32.465]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[01:20:32.885 --> 01:20:37.789]  Midas Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.469]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.489 --> 01:20:40.111]  If you haven't read this book, get a copy today.
[01:20:40.131 --> 01:20:40.171]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.191 --> 01:20:42.332]  If you have, pick up a copy for your friend or relative.
[01:20:42.392 --> 01:20:42.733]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:55.831]  Good morning, honey.
[01:20:56.171 --> 01:21:02.175]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[01:21:02.456 --> 01:21:03.056]  Yeah.
[01:21:03.456 --> 01:21:04.857]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:21:05.218 --> 01:21:08.620]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel Berkey system.
[01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:10.582]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:21:11.042 --> 01:21:12.743]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:21:13.123 --> 01:21:14.905]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:21:15.105 --> 01:21:16.046]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:21:16.386 --> 01:21:18.647]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:19.168]  What?! !
[01:21:19.628 --> 01:21:30.121]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[01:21:30.401 --> 01:21:35.247]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:21:35.567 --> 01:21:36.747]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[01:21:36.848 --> 01:21:38.668]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209.
[01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:39.428]  Or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.

[01:21:39.708 --> 01:21:39.889]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:39.929 --> 01:21:40.949]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:40.969 --> 01:21:42.269]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.553 --> 01:21:56.694]  Do you know the secret to reading 1,000% faster?
[01:21:57.114 --> 01:21:57.694]  That's right.
[01:21:57.914 --> 01:22:02.375]  The secret that could allow you to read 10 books in the time it takes others to read one.
[01:22:02.836 --> 01:22:06.016]  Hi, I'm Steve Glick, CEO of Infinite Mind.
[01:22:06.316 --> 01:22:10.998]  I'd like to send you a free demo of this secret developed by a leading expert in brain function.
[01:22:11.438 --> 01:22:14.319]  Experience with this free demo the secret to reading 1,000% faster.

[01:22:31.084 --> 01:22:33.985]  This free demo is only available for a limited time.
[01:22:34.205 --> 01:22:34.745]  Call now.
[01:22:35.145 --> 01:22:39.627]  Just think how reading 10 times faster could improve your life and the life of your family.
[01:22:40.007 --> 01:22:40.348]  That's 1-800-403-7311.
[01:22:40.368 --> 01:22:40.428]  1-800-403-7311.
[01:23:05.373 --> 01:23:11.798]  All right, John Ashcroft, yesterday morning, I'm in the shower, I get the call, and I preface that because, you know, my questions were decent.
[01:23:12.299 --> 01:23:14.501]  Could have, I guess, maybe had better ones, but I was a half asleep.
[01:23:14.961 --> 01:23:18.304]  Run down, get on the phone, National Radio Show wants me to go up against Ashcroft.
[01:23:19.051 --> 01:23:21.132]  They act like I'm just a caller, a regular caller.
[01:23:21.152 --> 01:23:21.793]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:23:22.393 --> 01:23:26.615]  And I ask him some questions, and he basically twists and lies and spins the whole thing.
[01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:28.496]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:28.977 --> 01:23:30.577]  I just heard a... Oh, boy.
[01:23:30.678 --> 01:23:31.078]  Okay.
[01:23:31.558 --> 01:23:32.939]  Let's go to Alex.
[01:23:33.019 --> 01:23:34.139]  Alex, you're on with John Ashcroft.
[01:23:34.179 --> 01:23:35.300]  His book is Never Again.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.481]  It's out now, folks.
[01:23:37.621 --> 01:23:38.222]  Well, yes.
[01:23:38.602 --> 01:23:39.562]  It's good to be here.
[01:23:39.622 --> 01:23:42.824]  I just have three questions for John Ashcroft.
[01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:43.705]  Well, okay.
[01:23:43.725 --> 01:23:46.066]  I don't know if we have that kind of time, sir, but let's get to them.
[01:23:46.246 --> 01:23:46.666]  Sure, man.
[01:23:46.686 --> 01:23:47.647]  Let me just throw them out.
[01:23:48.504 --> 01:23:56.848]  Number one, John Ashcroft in July before the attacks quit flying commercial because of the, quote, security threat the day before 9-11.
[01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:58.089]  Not.
[01:23:58.509 --> 01:24:02.591]  The White House called Mayor Willie Brown to not to fly to New York that day.
[01:24:03.111 --> 01:24:04.111]  That's the first question.
[01:24:04.171 --> 01:24:04.972]  Why did he do that?
[01:24:05.732 --> 01:24:09.354]  Then number two, they claim they never heard of a plan to fly hijacked planes into buildings.
[01:24:09.814 --> 01:24:11.415]  We know now that that was false.
[01:24:11.455 --> 01:24:13.136]  We know that that was a lie.
[01:24:13.236 --> 01:24:14.997]  Rice and others lied about that.
[01:24:15.357 --> 01:24:17.578]  And number three, what about Operation Northwoods?
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.221]  The official U.S.
[01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:22.706]  government plan to carry out 9-11-style attacks.
[01:24:22.966 --> 01:24:28.494]  And then, my comment, the bottom line... Well, wait, wait, wait.
[01:24:28.514 --> 01:24:29.515]  Do you want him to answer?
[01:24:29.535 --> 01:24:29.855]  Go ahead.
[01:24:29.895 --> 01:24:30.436]  Go ahead.
[01:24:30.516 --> 01:24:30.937]  I'll shut up.
[01:24:31.177 --> 01:24:32.198]  Yeah, the first three questions.
[01:24:32.218 --> 01:24:32.479]  Go ahead.
[01:24:34.839 --> 01:24:38.521]  You know, I did not cease flying on commercial aircraft.
[01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:40.602]  I flew back from Missouri with my wife.
[01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:41.562]  Have you heard this before?
[01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:43.723]  Oh, yeah, and it was on CBS.
[01:24:43.743 --> 01:24:47.425]  I think Dan Rather was the person popularizing this.
[01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:57.550]  I used government jets on government business, but in my private life, I was flying commercial aircraft right up through and beyond 9-11.
[01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:01.731]  I have never abandoned... Did you fly here commercially?
[01:25:01.751 --> 01:25:02.652]  No.
[01:25:03.957 --> 01:25:04.557]  For this trip.
[01:25:04.657 --> 01:25:05.258]  For this interview.
[01:25:06.139 --> 01:25:07.660]  I flew commercially yesterday.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:07.921]  Yeah.
[01:25:08.461 --> 01:25:12.846]  And I flew a private plane from Nashville here last night.
[01:25:12.986 --> 01:25:13.206]  Okay.
[01:25:13.506 --> 01:25:15.509]  So... So a combination.
[01:25:15.589 --> 01:25:17.531]  I fly commercially all the time.
[01:25:17.611 --> 01:25:19.232]  I was in Europe last week.
[01:25:19.312 --> 01:25:20.434]  I flew commercially over...
[01:25:21.134 --> 01:25:22.896]  And I flew commercially back.
[01:25:23.096 --> 01:25:23.396]  Okay.
[01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:27.219]  So... But what about... Okay, so it's just flat false.
[01:25:27.319 --> 01:25:27.900]  Okay.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.801]  But you fly commercially now, but what about 9-11?
[01:25:29.841 --> 01:25:32.303]  Around 9-11, did you stop because you knew something?
[01:25:32.323 --> 01:25:33.444]  Absolutely not.
[01:25:33.464 --> 01:25:33.865]  Okay.
[01:25:34.045 --> 01:25:36.247]  As I said, my wife and I... And what else did he ask?
[01:25:36.307 --> 01:25:36.847]  I've forgotten.
[01:25:36.867 --> 01:25:37.208]  Do you know?
[01:25:37.228 --> 01:25:44.393]  He talked... About the attacks that they knew about the 9-11... Your plan, the government's plan for 9-11... Was there a government plan to blow up planes...
[01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:48.271]  Not to my knowledge.
[01:25:49.272 --> 01:25:50.033]  Okay, sir.
[01:25:50.073 --> 01:25:51.315]  That's astounding.
[01:25:51.335 --> 01:25:52.436]  Sir, is there anything else?
[01:25:54.259 --> 01:25:55.140]  He also asked, sir.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.862]  Did he hang up, sir?
[01:25:57.462 --> 01:25:57.923]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:25:58.804 --> 01:26:01.728]  Well, no, it's just that, bottom line...
[01:26:02.583 --> 01:26:07.267]  We know that the PNAC boys wrote in their own documents they needed a new Pearl Harbor attack.
[01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:09.368]  We know governments stage events.
[01:26:09.448 --> 01:26:13.431]  Operation Northwoods has been on ABC News, Baltimore Sun, U.S.
[01:26:13.451 --> 01:26:16.013]  government plan to stage terror attacks.
[01:26:16.093 --> 01:26:23.438]  And he didn't answer the question about Mayor Willie Brown getting the call from the White House not to fly the night before.
[01:26:23.498 --> 01:26:24.939]  That was in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.300]  That was in the Associated Press.
[01:26:27.701 --> 01:26:29.322]  John, your comments on that.
[01:26:29.342 --> 01:26:31.144]  Were certain people in the government told not to
[01:26:32.074 --> 01:26:32.635]  Not to fly?
[01:26:32.655 --> 01:26:36.257]  I have no awareness that anybody was ever told not to fly.
[01:26:36.297 --> 01:26:39.360]  And if they were told not to fly, I don't know about it.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.662]  I certainly have never called Mayor Willie Brown.
[01:26:45.044 --> 01:26:47.326]  Former Attorney General John Ashcroft is here.
[01:26:47.766 --> 01:26:51.349]  John, man, I'm telling you, this is a growing thing.
[01:26:51.469 --> 01:26:54.732]  It's a scary thing to me that people believe our government...
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:59.703]  And it goes to such weird extremes that our government caused 9-11.
[01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:06.367]  And then Mancow goes on to say, but it does look to me like you guys are staging fake terror alerts, which, by the way, is admitted.
[01:27:06.788 --> 01:27:11.671]  Notice Ashcroft didn't touch the fact that Rice and he and many others all said, we never heard of a plan.
[01:27:11.731 --> 01:27:13.932]  We never heard of a plan to fly hijacked planes in the buildings.
[01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:20.156]  Running drills that day, running drills two weeks before, running drills a year before, Project Bojangles, all of it.
[01:27:20.217 --> 01:27:21.978]  Total lies, now proven to be lies.
[01:27:21.998 --> 01:27:23.759]  We told you it was lies five years ago.
[01:27:24.632 --> 01:27:26.963]  And he lied about the Stopping Flying commercial.
[01:27:27.004 --> 01:27:28.149]  That's an FBI memo.
[01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.772]  That's admitted.
[01:27:30.194 --> 01:27:34.375]  And he's got to be lying about not knowing about Northwoods.
[01:27:34.815 --> 01:27:38.836]  And clearly people like Ashcroft are involved in at least the cover-up of 9-11.
[01:27:39.516 --> 01:27:43.917]  It is the Defense Department and private contractors that are involved in carrying out the attacks themselves.
[01:27:44.557 --> 01:27:48.218]  But immediately, the majority thanked me for confronting him.
[01:27:48.238 --> 01:27:52.399]  But I got a few emails and looked at a few message boards that said, Jones dropped the ball.
[01:27:52.439 --> 01:27:53.979]  He should have asked this question, that question.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.140]  Hey, I'll call you some morning.
[01:27:57.163 --> 01:28:03.685]  When you've been awake about ten minutes and you're in the shower, and I'll say, you've got a minute and a half to get to the phone to ask John Ashcroft questions.
[01:28:04.665 --> 01:28:11.687]  And then while your hair is dripping, I'll let you then talk to the Attorney General and see if you don't stutter and bumble about.
[01:28:12.247 --> 01:28:16.028]  And again, it isn't about me getting criticized for not doing the best job of confronting Ashcroft.
[01:28:17.369 --> 01:28:18.609]  It's about the mindset.
[01:28:19.719 --> 01:28:21.120]  Instead of, hey, good job, Alex.
[01:28:21.581 --> 01:28:22.742]  Hey, you should have asked him this.
[01:28:22.782 --> 01:28:24.583]  You know, maybe your next time, ask him this.
[01:28:24.823 --> 01:28:26.745]  No, it's like, man, you dropped the ball.
[01:28:26.765 --> 01:28:27.466]  You're an idiot.
[01:28:28.186 --> 01:28:32.210]  Should have asked the trader about insider trading, CIA.
[01:28:32.370 --> 01:28:34.471]  Should have asked him about where's the blood.
[01:28:34.491 --> 01:28:37.514]  Should have... Okay, whatever.
[01:28:37.834 --> 01:28:38.815]  I got on the field.
[01:28:39.055 --> 01:28:39.796]  I took action.
[01:28:39.896 --> 01:28:40.637]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.979 --> 01:28:44.860]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:46.862]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.851 --> 01:28:55.237]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:28:55.557 --> 01:29:02.962]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[01:29:03.102 --> 01:29:10.888]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[01:29:11.088 --> 01:29:12.169]  And there's no odor.
[01:29:12.429 --> 01:29:22.432]  Stabilized Allison gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[01:29:22.472 --> 01:29:30.714]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[01:29:30.994 --> 01:29:36.556]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.

[01:29:53.842 --> 01:29:57.404]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.444 --> 01:29:57.944]  are located?
[01:29:58.144 --> 01:30:01.545]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:30:53.374 --> 01:30:56.016]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[01:30:56.336 --> 01:30:58.537]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[01:30:58.837 --> 01:31:00.558]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.

[01:31:12.985 --> 01:31:18.108]  We've learned verbiage from the Total Transformation program, and it's almost like magic.
[01:31:18.448 --> 01:31:20.869]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[01:31:20.969 --> 01:31:26.251]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.

[01:32:04.464 --> 01:32:10.408]  All right, your calls from Australia to Canada, from North Carolina to Florida are coming up, but for just a moment, I can't help myself.
[01:32:10.448 --> 01:32:11.189]  Let me hear Jimmy.
[01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:27.140]  There must be some kind of way out of here Said a joker to the thief There's too much confusion I can't get no relief
[01:32:28.401 --> 01:32:30.083]  We're good to go.
[01:33:01.602 --> 01:33:03.763]  We're good to go.
[01:33:38.401 --> 01:33:39.522]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:33:39.562 --> 01:33:41.003]  Let's go right to your calls.
[01:33:41.063 --> 01:33:41.924]  Thank you for holding.
[01:33:42.084 --> 01:33:44.506]  Andrew in the land down under.
[01:33:44.706 --> 01:33:45.927]  Australia, welcome, sir.
[01:33:46.968 --> 01:33:47.629]  Yes, Alex.
[01:33:47.929 --> 01:33:48.390]  G'day, mate.
[01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:49.290]  Hello, sir.
[01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.791]  Good to hear.
[01:33:49.811 --> 01:33:51.032]  Good to talk to you again.
[01:33:52.236 --> 01:33:52.916]  Interesting.
[01:33:53.296 --> 01:33:56.577]  Love Jimi Hendrix and my favourite songs all along the Watchtower.
[01:33:56.677 --> 01:34:00.638]  I urge you to hear the XTC version of that song.
[01:34:00.738 --> 01:34:01.358]  Fantastic.
[01:34:01.758 --> 01:34:05.659]  But on what I called, synchronicity is with me tonight.
[01:34:06.099 --> 01:34:09.200]  You're talking about sports fans being a big problem.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:17.921]  Have you heard about the alternate or original 7-7 plan for sarin gassing the Australian and British cricketers?
[01:34:18.602 --> 01:34:20.682]  Yes, I did see that government hype.
[01:34:21.727 --> 01:34:23.589]  Well, that was... Totally.
[01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:37.422]  It was hyped so hard in Australia that our media ownership laws, which were changed and passed in our lower house, was completely pushed to the back of the news on the back of this sports-related fiasco.
[01:34:38.655 --> 01:34:43.956]  Well, again, I don't know if my analogy made sense, but it's literally a facsimile of combat.
[01:34:44.296 --> 01:34:47.057]  That's why people get so excited about it, but it's not real.
[01:34:47.497 --> 01:34:52.378]  We should be engaging in the information war against those that are really attacking us.
[01:34:53.178 --> 01:34:58.219]  This is where men expend their, quote, male energy, and I don't think people actually play sports.
[01:34:58.239 --> 01:34:58.999]  I think that's great.
[01:34:59.239 --> 01:35:04.880]  You actually want to go have ritualized combat with people playing the sport, but to watch it, and to
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.603]  Well, Alex, as you may remember, I work in the entertainment industry.
[01:35:08.643 --> 01:35:09.704]  I did the Superman stuff for you.
[01:35:09.764 --> 01:35:12.887]  And I got your message out for Martial Law 9-11 on the set there.
[01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:36.045]  And I worked on our grand final here for the equivalent of your NFL.
[01:35:37.165 --> 01:35:41.867]  And it's literally turned into just a... What would you call it?
[01:35:41.907 --> 01:35:46.748]  The Simpsons or any commercial TV show.
[01:35:47.089 --> 01:35:48.349]  Just total mindlessness?
[01:35:49.437 --> 01:35:50.017]  Completely.
[01:35:50.097 --> 01:35:52.618]  There's nothing to do now about the sportsmanship.
[01:35:53.018 --> 01:35:55.739]  I grew up with rugby league here in Australia.
[01:35:56.399 --> 01:35:59.639]  Oh yeah, I played all sorts of sports myself.
[01:35:59.719 --> 01:36:01.520]  I'm not even knocking going to a game.
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:04.041]  It's just, this is their lives.
[01:36:04.421 --> 01:36:05.701]  This is why they're men.
[01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:07.561]  It's because they wear a stupid shirt.
[01:36:09.142 --> 01:36:12.983]  And the colors are just, it's almost gang-like, isn't it?
[01:36:13.023 --> 01:36:14.243]  It's almost occult-like.
[01:36:15.046 --> 01:36:15.506]  Oh, it is.
[01:36:15.526 --> 01:36:23.448]  Again, I'm angry about it because it robs people of what those instincts are really designed for.
[01:36:24.648 --> 01:36:26.368]  Well, it hasn't got me, Alex.
[01:36:26.408 --> 01:36:28.168]  I'm out there still distributing.
[01:36:28.208 --> 01:36:32.289]  I've got another half a dozen out tonight of Terror Storm and Martial Law.
[01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:43.131]  One thing for your listeners, I've found if you take the time to just burn and print an actual copy and do a cover...
[01:36:43.737 --> 01:36:44.899]  That's why we do that, yeah.
[01:36:56.785 --> 01:36:58.507]  We need to re-upload the covers.
[01:36:58.627 --> 01:37:01.829]  We need to re-upload the covers, too, because the first printing had a little typo.
[01:37:01.890 --> 01:37:04.532]  The new printing we're doing right now doesn't have a little typo.
[01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:07.834]  It says an inside job instead of, you know, is an inside job.
[01:37:08.675 --> 01:37:10.256]  But thank you, sir, and keep it up.
[01:37:10.276 --> 01:37:11.918]  What do you think about North Korea?
[01:37:11.958 --> 01:37:13.439]  You're definitely in strike zone.
[01:37:13.819 --> 01:37:17.122]  They threatened to attack Japan, Australia, but they're not a problem.
[01:37:17.382 --> 01:37:18.884]  We've got to go ahead and attack Iran.
[01:37:18.964 --> 01:37:19.644]  Of course not.
[01:37:19.664 --> 01:37:20.625]  Was it Singapore, Alex?
[01:37:22.247 --> 01:37:24.728]  Was it Singapore that attacked us, or perhaps Japan?
[01:37:25.168 --> 01:37:25.688]  Exactly.
[01:37:25.748 --> 01:37:27.368]  Let's go after Singapore or Japan.
[01:37:27.968 --> 01:37:33.170]  It's kind of like Afghanistan supposedly attacks us, even if you believe the official story, but we attack Iraq.
[01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:34.490]  Indeed.
[01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:34.970]  Indeed.
[01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:45.012]  I mean, we're so far, we're such a small community here in Australia, and it was another thing, the media laws here, nothing to worry about.
[01:37:45.032 --> 01:37:51.234]  We've only got three commercial stations free to air in Australia, but now we can have two of them owned by the same person.
[01:37:52.065 --> 01:37:53.026]  Well, that's wonderful.
[01:37:53.086 --> 01:37:55.367]  That's just absolutely fabulous.
[01:37:55.427 --> 01:37:56.488]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:57.388 --> 01:37:58.429]  Now, what is Australia?
[01:37:58.689 --> 01:37:59.570]  25 million people?
[01:38:00.190 --> 01:38:00.871]  Show my ignorance.
[01:38:00.891 --> 01:38:02.111]  I should have kept him on and asked him out.
[01:38:02.151 --> 01:38:03.172]  I think it's like 25 million.
[01:38:03.913 --> 01:38:05.954]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:38:05.974 --> 01:38:09.016]  Let's talk to Dave in North Carolina, a little closer to field.
[01:38:09.056 --> 01:38:09.436]  Go ahead.
[01:38:09.976 --> 01:38:11.277]  Northern California, brother.
[01:38:11.537 --> 01:38:14.739]  Okay, well, they told me NC, so... Okay, that's cool, man.
[01:38:16.508 --> 01:38:18.050]  About $29 million in 1996.
[01:38:18.190 --> 01:38:19.892]  I was down there.
[01:38:20.492 --> 01:38:20.953]  Okay, good.
[01:38:20.973 --> 01:38:22.114]  So it's almost $30 million now.
[01:38:22.134 --> 01:38:23.355]  There you go.
[01:38:23.555 --> 01:38:29.381]  So I wanted to fact-check myself on Luis Posada Carrillo and Orlando Bosch.
[01:38:29.441 --> 01:38:31.343]  Weren't those the guys that bombed the Cuban jet?
[01:38:31.744 --> 01:38:35.548]  Well, yeah, and four other guys got convicted, too.
[01:38:35.908 --> 01:38:39.752]  Okay, well, anyway, so I got that wrong on my rant about George Herbert Walker Bush the other day.
[01:38:40.287 --> 01:38:45.449]  So I wanted to straighten that out, because I know you're a stickler for facts, and you can keep more facts in your head than anybody I've ever heard.
[01:38:45.489 --> 01:38:46.249]  That's one of the reasons I like you.
[01:38:46.269 --> 01:38:46.889]  Well, I make mistakes, though.
[01:38:46.949 --> 01:38:47.590]  Check out what I do.
[01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:48.490]  We all do, of course.
[01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:52.131]  You're dealing with so much information, and there's no way not to, and things change.
[01:38:52.511 --> 01:38:57.073]  Anyway, so I've got two more things real fast about the censorship of YouTube and that.
[01:38:57.553 --> 01:39:05.336]  Stephen Colbert, I followed a link to him to watch his routine on the Republican Man Boy Love Association.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.521]  And it was blocked.
[01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:09.082]  It said, you can't access this.
[01:39:09.122 --> 01:39:11.263]  There's a property issue or something.
[01:39:11.283 --> 01:39:12.724]  I don't remember the exact quote.
[01:39:12.744 --> 01:39:16.846]  Yeah, C-SPAN asked that the Colbert press dinner be removed.
[01:39:17.607 --> 01:39:17.947]  Oh, okay.
[01:39:18.067 --> 01:39:19.728]  Well, anyway, so you can't even get it on YouTube.
[01:39:19.748 --> 01:39:21.009]  At least I couldn't on that link.
[01:39:21.049 --> 01:39:21.789]  Maybe there's other ones.
[01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:25.731]  And also, I must have missed this.
[01:39:25.871 --> 01:39:31.054]  On October 4th, President Bush signed a bill giving $33.8 billion to Homeland Security.
[01:39:31.074 --> 01:39:32.075]  Is that true?
[01:39:32.095 --> 01:39:32.155]  Yes.
[01:39:33.096 --> 01:39:33.356]  My God.
[01:39:35.975 --> 01:39:45.703]  That money will be used to be paid to the military industrial complex to run domestic operations against the new occupied slave population of the United States of Slaves.
[01:39:46.044 --> 01:39:46.644]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:46.684 --> 01:39:48.005]  I appreciate your call, Dave.
[01:39:48.025 --> 01:39:48.686]  Good to hear from you.
[01:39:49.246 --> 01:39:51.108]  Let's talk to Danny in Florida.
[01:39:51.168 --> 01:39:51.808]  Go ahead, Danny.
[01:39:54.611 --> 01:39:54.851]  Hello.
[01:39:55.111 --> 01:39:55.391]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:56.112 --> 01:39:56.953]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:57.393 --> 01:40:00.415]  Hey, man, I just want to let you know you're doing a great job.
[01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:03.398]  Don't listen to all that criticism out there, you know.
[01:40:04.638 --> 01:40:05.258]  Oh, I don't.
[01:40:05.338 --> 01:40:08.319]  I'm more concerned about why they themselves are criticizing.
[01:40:08.579 --> 01:40:12.961]  See, it isn't about that I got criticized for not confronting Ashcroft correctly.
[01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:23.724]  It's that instead of those guys taking action or confronting other people themselves or finding out what shows he's going to be on and, you know, getting on themselves, it's that I didn't do it properly.
[01:40:23.764 --> 01:40:25.025]  It's just a mindset.
[01:40:25.965 --> 01:40:26.705]  Exactly, man.
[01:40:27.265 --> 01:40:27.985]  That's the way I feel.
[01:40:28.025 --> 01:40:32.787]  I see a lot of people, they listen to you, you know, people out there listening to the show, you know,
[01:40:33.484 --> 01:40:37.445]  And they just listen, but they don't take any action themselves, and they want to turn around and criticize.
[01:40:37.465 --> 01:40:45.208]  You know, there's a lot of things people can do that I think that they, you know, they're not really realizing the simple things that they can do to help the movement.
[01:40:46.188 --> 01:40:47.689]  You know, walk around with the t-shirts.
[01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:52.570]  You know, I got a couple of the shirts from you, like the Gun Right shirt.
[01:40:53.311 --> 01:40:55.691]  And you meet a lot of like-minded people doing that, don't you?
[01:40:56.272 --> 01:40:56.672]  Exactly.
[01:40:56.692 --> 01:40:57.212]  That's what happened.
[01:40:57.292 --> 01:40:59.073]  I mean, I'm on, right now I'm in Florida.
[01:40:59.173 --> 01:41:00.593]  I'm on vacation with my family.
[01:41:01.353 --> 01:41:02.094]  I live in Tennessee.
[01:41:02.134 --> 01:41:03.054]  I listen to you every day.
[01:41:03.907 --> 01:41:04.708]  On Truth Radio.
[01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:12.076]  And I went to Florida on vacation and we went to, we happened to go to Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios and all that.
[01:41:13.016 --> 01:41:15.179]  I knew they were going to have the thumb scanning in place.
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:24.067]  So I'm there with my family, alright, my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, and they're very aware of, you know, what's going on in the world.
[01:41:24.107 --> 01:41:26.770]  You know, they're very receptive, like you say, to the truth.
[01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:27.531]  They're from Columbia.
[01:41:28.851 --> 01:41:29.992]  So they know a lot more things.
[01:41:30.052 --> 01:41:32.294]  I mean, they pay attention to a lot of different media sources.
[01:41:32.414 --> 01:41:37.177]  Oh, yeah, you tell somebody from a place where they've been slaves that stuff's going on, they're like, oh, yeah, we know.
[01:41:37.197 --> 01:41:47.005]  But you tell the decadent, stupid Americans who can't hold a candle to our forefathers' stuff, and some of them, that's ridiculous.
[01:41:47.325 --> 01:41:48.066]  But, sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:48.846 --> 01:41:51.348]  Yeah, that's exactly, and that's the way I feel.
[01:41:52.029 --> 01:41:57.713]  And I'm in line with my father-in-law and my mother-in-law, you know, my wife, my little girl, and my sister-in-law.
[01:41:58.410 --> 01:42:02.093]  Let me guess, a manager comes over and says, it's fine, you don't have to, please quiet down.
[01:42:02.113 --> 01:42:02.433]  No, nobody...
[01:42:28.894 --> 01:42:29.094]  Good.
[01:42:29.154 --> 01:42:29.535]  Exactly.
[01:42:29.555 --> 01:42:29.715]  Yeah.
[01:42:48.689 --> 01:42:50.551]  He says, but they're not going to record no information.
[01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:52.392]  You know, they're not going to do nothing with that thumbprint.
[01:42:52.412 --> 01:42:58.497]  Which is the exact same, did you hear me air that newscast where they go, we take your fingerprints, but there's no data saved.
[01:42:58.817 --> 01:42:59.678]  Total lie!
[01:42:59.898 --> 01:43:01.740]  It's all turning to zeros and ones.
[01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:03.921]  What do you think a digital photo is?
[01:43:03.981 --> 01:43:05.062]  What do you think everything?
[01:43:05.323 --> 01:43:06.944]  It's zeros and ones.
[01:43:07.144 --> 01:43:12.809]  But they tell the moron public, we don't take your digital face scan, it's zeros and ones.
[01:43:13.069 --> 01:43:15.411]  We don't take your thumbprint, it's zeros and ones.
[01:43:15.931 --> 01:43:16.071]  Exactly.
[01:43:16.091 --> 01:43:17.152]  That's what he was saying.
[01:43:17.172 --> 01:43:18.993]  The exact words that he just said.
[01:43:19.093 --> 01:43:20.033]  Oh, of course.
[01:43:20.053 --> 01:43:25.136]  Because there's one talking point written up in 19... What was it?
[01:43:25.156 --> 01:43:27.517]  It was in 2001 at the big Chicago conference.
[01:43:27.537 --> 01:43:28.278]  We have the minutes.
[01:43:28.838 --> 01:43:33.201]  They had a vote and wrote up the talking points publicly how to lie to us.
[01:43:33.421 --> 01:43:33.901]  And they said...
[01:43:35.422 --> 01:43:42.885]  Our internal data shows that 78% are violently opposed to this, but we've also found that they're passive and will submit.
[01:43:43.145 --> 01:43:44.725]  They use the word submit.
[01:43:44.745 --> 01:43:45.866]  You've got to submit.
[01:43:46.626 --> 01:43:48.387]  Yeah, that's what it looks like in the line, man.
[01:43:48.407 --> 01:43:49.747]  You've got a lot of people just doing it.
[01:43:49.767 --> 01:43:50.628]  They go along with it.
[01:43:51.288 --> 01:43:54.789]  And I just think more people need to make a scene in these kind of situations.
[01:43:54.809 --> 01:43:55.350]  So what did he say?
[01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:56.250]  It's okay, sir.
[01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:57.310]  You don't have to.
[01:43:58.071 --> 01:43:58.211]  Right.
[01:43:58.251 --> 01:43:59.131]  He told me to go ahead.
[01:43:59.191 --> 01:43:59.912]  It's okay.
[01:43:59.932 --> 01:44:00.372]  Don't worry.
[01:44:00.392 --> 01:44:00.912]  We understand.
[01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:09.274]  And then I turned around, I waited for my family, and they're like, you know, because my mother-in-law, she don't speak English, and, you know, I seen him telling her to do the same thing, to scan her thumb.
[01:44:09.314 --> 01:44:10.335]  I said, no, they're all with me.
[01:44:10.355 --> 01:44:11.956]  You know, they're all not going to scan.
[01:44:12.937 --> 01:44:14.698]  You know, so everybody just kept going through the line.
[01:44:15.712 --> 01:44:18.474]  And, you know, we all made it through, and I told them, good, congratulations.
[01:44:18.514 --> 01:44:21.136]  You know, everybody helped defeat the New World Order today, you know?
[01:44:21.456 --> 01:44:22.016]  Exactly.
[01:44:22.056 --> 01:44:35.645]  The problem is, they say that at first they're not going to make you, but then they're going to have it where it's all computerized, and you won't have a choice, and all that will be there is security guards in the future that will run up with submachine guns, because it's going to be terror groups.
[01:44:35.665 --> 01:44:43.130]  They're going to be Christian groups that are against the chip, against the biometrics, who are going to blow up the buildings and poison water supplies.
[01:44:43.170 --> 01:44:44.291]  Of course, it will be the government...
[01:44:44.751 --> 01:45:05.923]  And then the government is going to associate all of that, and literally, folks, you're going to have cop shows in 3D in your living room where the car's running somewhere in Iowa or somewhere in Montana, and it's going to be the police jet coppers have got the terrorists in their line, and they're trying to escape, and they'll be chasing them, and they refuse to take the ship.
[01:45:05.963 --> 01:45:07.524]  They were involved in the terror attack.
[01:45:08.164 --> 01:45:09.885]  Watch as our troops fire missiles!
[01:45:10.899 --> 01:45:11.820]  I know.
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:13.041]  Laugh at me like everything else.
[01:45:13.061 --> 01:45:13.801]  You will see it.
[01:45:14.162 --> 01:45:16.564]  And the car is going to blow up with the family in it.
[01:45:16.724 --> 01:45:18.745]  And the people at home are going to go, Yay!
[01:45:18.825 --> 01:45:19.986]  Terrorist defeated!
[01:45:20.026 --> 01:45:21.067]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:45:21.608 --> 01:45:22.268]  Yeah!
[01:45:22.288 --> 01:45:23.069]  Alright!
[01:45:23.169 --> 01:45:23.569]  Yeah!
[01:45:23.609 --> 01:45:24.470]  We're stupid!
[01:45:26.016 --> 01:45:28.059]  Because the Fed, see, the first phase is the Muslims.
[01:45:28.179 --> 01:45:28.920]  Oh, they're going to get us.
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:29.500]  They're everywhere.
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:30.521]  They're going to nuke us.
[01:45:30.541 --> 01:45:31.462]  They're going to attack us.
[01:45:31.482 --> 01:45:32.303]  They're going to kill us.
[01:45:32.604 --> 01:45:33.865]  Build the camps for them.
[01:45:34.186 --> 01:45:40.173]  But the Fed, all the training manuals, all the real information is about their co-members who won't take the biometrics.
[01:45:40.433 --> 01:45:42.295]  There's co-members who won't take the chips.
[01:45:42.635 --> 01:45:44.538]  They're going to be involved in terrorism.
[01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:55.701]  And of course, really, Christians are just going to try to stay on farms and ranches and be left alone and be in their own communities and the armored vehicles are going to roll in and the families will fight back and it'll be on the news.
[01:45:55.961 --> 01:45:57.922]  Look at the terrorists fighting!
[01:45:57.942 --> 01:46:01.943]  Look at them fighting our brave forces!
[01:46:02.623 --> 01:46:05.444]  Why, they're probably molesting children in there!
[01:46:05.644 --> 01:46:06.904]  We need to kill them!
[01:46:10.606 --> 01:46:12.248]  I mean, it's just 1, 2, 3.
[01:46:12.848 --> 01:46:13.409]  What comes next?
[01:46:13.429 --> 01:46:13.409]  4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[01:46:16.031 --> 01:46:17.353]  I mean, that's all I'm doing is counting.
[01:46:17.913 --> 01:46:19.455]  Just following the road map.
[01:46:19.495 --> 01:46:20.596]  They've said what they're going to do.
[01:46:22.170 --> 01:46:23.770]  We had the Bergen County Police Chief on.
[01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:25.251]  He said he will make us take chips.
[01:46:25.291 --> 01:46:26.031]  He will enforce it.
[01:46:26.051 --> 01:46:27.151]  He believes we all need them.
[01:46:27.251 --> 01:46:28.731]  I've had nightclub owners on.
[01:46:28.771 --> 01:46:29.712]  Everyone must have a chip.
[01:46:30.032 --> 01:46:32.672]  I've had head marketing people for Applied Digital.
[01:46:32.712 --> 01:46:34.212]  Yes, everyone will have to take the chip.
[01:46:34.633 --> 01:46:39.253]  The big top university professors, the post-humanists, say they're going to make everyone take chips.
[01:46:39.854 --> 01:46:40.794]  It's coming soon.
[01:46:40.874 --> 01:46:41.754]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:46:42.214 --> 01:46:44.655]  And you will be a terrorist if you don't.
[01:46:44.675 --> 01:46:47.855]  Andy Rooney, take a chip and prove you're a good person.
[01:46:48.155 --> 01:46:50.276]  Everyone must have it to prove you're good.
[01:46:50.596 --> 01:46:51.416]  Exact quote.
[01:46:54.989 --> 01:46:55.349]  You see?
[01:46:55.369 --> 01:46:56.910]  And see, we're not the weirdos.
[01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:59.131]  We're the normal people going, they're on TV all the same way.
[01:46:59.331 --> 01:47:00.472]  I've got USA Today.
[01:47:00.912 --> 01:47:02.593]  I've got, which one is it?
[01:47:03.474 --> 01:47:04.734]  Daily Mail out of England.
[01:47:05.355 --> 01:47:10.077]  And I've got another article here in the stack, all mainstream the last two days, with the same similar headlines.
[01:47:10.817 --> 01:47:13.579]  Young shoppers want to pay with a chip in the skin.
[01:47:14.419 --> 01:47:15.800]  There aren't young shoppers.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:23.184]  I mean, you might have like that Jacobs kid who just died in a motorcycle accident, who four years ago, it turned out,
[01:47:24.055 --> 01:47:24.795]  We're good to go.
[01:47:24.875 --> 01:47:25.656]  We're good to go.
[01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:42.850]  What did I say?
[01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:50.514]  I said they're going to pitch it, that the youth want it, and it's the new trendy thing, and that the adults are squares.
[01:47:51.195 --> 01:47:52.995]  Oh, man, I've got 12 chips.
[01:47:53.316 --> 01:47:54.396]  My mom doesn't know.
[01:47:54.596 --> 01:47:55.697]  Look, I can activate.
[01:47:55.917 --> 01:47:57.578]  I can get into the theme park cheaper.
[01:47:58.678 --> 01:48:00.139]  Oh, the police trust me more now.
[01:48:00.459 --> 01:48:01.760]  I'm really cool.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:04.201]  It wasn't hard to see.
[01:48:04.241 --> 01:48:09.584]  That's how they pushed every other program is through fake rebellion, fake counterculture.
[01:48:11.147 --> 01:48:23.181]  I said they were using the body modification movement and hyping it on television and the internet to push it, and then the Washington Post wrote that industry officials were indeed funding it for preparation for implantation.
[01:48:23.521 --> 01:48:25.924]  That was WashTech, Washington Post computer page.
[01:48:26.627 --> 01:48:27.628]  We had the writer on.
[01:48:28.268 --> 01:48:48.042]  Then it came out that the Army Pentagon document got released in January 1, 2000, a year after I had announced all this from other programs I'd seen, and they said, we're going to use security as a way to make people take it, and we're also going to push it as stylish and cool with the young people.
[01:48:48.322 --> 01:48:50.624]  Pentagon programs.
[01:48:51.869 --> 01:49:06.002]  And now you see USA Today, all the big magazines, Time Magazine for Kids, and three different issues in the last two years in the public schools, tens of millions reading that, oh, the chip's so much fun and cool, you're going to be getting them soon.
[01:49:06.282 --> 01:49:09.825]  You see, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
[01:49:10.065 --> 01:49:11.707]  You see, it's all happening.
[01:49:11.967 --> 01:49:13.449]  It's all going on.
[01:49:13.749 --> 01:49:15.130]  It's all unfolding.
[01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:17.052]  And they're going to start the terrorist attacks.
[01:49:17.955 --> 01:49:20.136]  This is five, six, seven years down the road.
[01:49:20.156 --> 01:49:20.856]  It could be even quicker.
[01:49:20.876 --> 01:49:22.837]  If a nuke goes off, that could accelerate things.
[01:49:23.237 --> 01:49:24.398]  Kind of a quickening effect.
[01:49:24.918 --> 01:49:25.719]  Everything's a quickening.
[01:49:25.919 --> 01:49:27.779]  And they'll just be setting off the nukes.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:31.341]  And oh my gosh, the Christian cultists did it.
[01:49:32.021 --> 01:49:32.822]  They did it.
[01:49:32.942 --> 01:49:33.822]  They're the ones.
[01:49:33.902 --> 01:49:35.143]  They don't want the chip.
[01:49:36.092 --> 01:49:38.174]  Oh, we've got to put them in camps.
[01:49:38.435 --> 01:49:39.556]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:49:40.217 --> 01:49:45.944]  They killed so many people that crazy Christian bioweapon scientists released it.
[01:49:46.665 --> 01:49:47.686]  Kill those people!
[01:49:47.706 --> 01:49:49.529]  If they won't take it, kill them!
[01:49:49.549 --> 01:49:50.390]  Just protect me!
[01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:50.690]  Kill them!
[01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:51.211]  Kill them!
[01:49:51.331 --> 01:49:51.732]  Kill them!
[01:49:56.793 --> 01:49:59.974]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.334 --> 01:50:02.234]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.634 --> 01:50:10.276]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.956 --> 01:50:18.017]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.418 --> 01:50:21.338]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.738 --> 01:50:24.039]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.479 --> 01:50:25.299]  NSA spies.

[01:50:53.388 --> 01:51:01.652]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.913 --> 01:51:06.275]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.555 --> 01:51:15.460]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.302]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.582 --> 01:51:24.610]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons for one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:31.661]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.142 --> 01:51:32.682]  What about you?
[01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:38.774]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:53.243 --> 01:52:01.171]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:52:01.651 --> 01:52:04.814]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:52:05.194 --> 01:52:08.237]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[01:52:08.618 --> 01:52:13.442]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[01:52:13.883 --> 01:52:16.205]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[01:52:16.954 --> 01:52:21.657]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?
[01:52:22.137 --> 01:52:28.001]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.

[01:52:29.942 --> 01:52:35.605]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows and birds.
[01:52:36.075 --> 01:52:36.676]  We're good to go.
[01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:37.497]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.204 --> 01:53:02.225]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.825 --> 01:53:05.826]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.126 --> 01:53:09.787]  Mr. News, I've got a favor I want to ask you.
[01:53:09.827 --> 01:53:16.128]  We've got two Blue Dobbs clips talking about the Pan-American Union, North American Union, Trans-Texas Corridors, all of it.
[01:53:16.528 --> 01:53:20.689]  But remember that first clip from like three months ago where he said, America as we know it is now dead?
[01:53:21.889 --> 01:53:25.310]  Can somebody find that for us and email it to Aaron at Infowars.com?
[01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:30.814]  We've been looking for a while, and millions of us together, I guarantee you, can find it.
[01:53:31.474 --> 01:53:33.055]  I know YouTube took it down a couple times.
[01:53:33.115 --> 01:53:34.036]  It was put back up there.
[01:53:34.056 --> 01:53:34.877]  Does somebody have that?
[01:53:35.317 --> 01:53:46.587]  And we're trying to get the actual video, high-quality video, of that Montana Senate debate for a documentary we're going to be working with, and we can't seem to get a copy of it.
[01:53:46.607 --> 01:53:47.888]  Did somebody TiVo that?
[01:53:47.908 --> 01:53:49.109]  Did somebody take that?
[01:53:49.409 --> 01:53:50.090]  We need your help.
[01:53:51.471 --> 01:53:54.794]  Speaking of needing your help, Google Video has now frozen the counters.
[01:53:55.690 --> 01:53:56.611]  On Terror Storm.
[01:53:57.391 --> 01:54:05.275]  Twice that they admit to, they've erased our numbers to get us out of the top rankings so we're not in the top 100 where tens of millions would then watch the film.
[01:54:06.396 --> 01:54:15.500]  It's over 4 million now, adding together all the views we've had before they erase them, which would keep us in the very top of the top 100 to get 4 million views in just a few weeks.
[01:54:17.081 --> 01:54:21.003]  So please, tell everyone you know that Terror Storm is free at Google Video.
[01:54:21.043 --> 01:54:25.105]  Just go to Google, click Video, right there at the top and type in Terror Storm
[01:54:25.911 --> 01:54:27.812]  Terror Storm, into your search engine.
[01:54:28.312 --> 01:54:32.354]  And you can find free downloads of it there at YouTube as well, which is now Google as well.
[01:54:33.274 --> 01:54:35.195]  It's all available, please.
[01:54:35.375 --> 01:54:36.076]  I made the film.
[01:54:36.136 --> 01:54:36.576]  It's free.
[01:54:36.636 --> 01:54:37.676]  I travel all over the place.
[01:54:38.156 --> 01:54:39.237]  Spent all my money making it.
[01:54:40.231 --> 01:54:44.472]  Will you at least help us get it out and not let the censors keep erasing it or deleting it?
[01:54:44.512 --> 01:54:46.372]  Because people need to see this.
[01:54:46.412 --> 01:54:56.355]  The history of government-sponsored terror, 7-7, 9-11, the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the propaganda, the fake news, the torture, the secret police, the brainwashing.
[01:54:56.435 --> 01:54:58.035]  It's all in Terror Storm.
[01:54:58.175 --> 01:54:59.215]  Very fast-moving.
[01:54:59.635 --> 01:55:00.936]  Very professionally produced.
[01:55:01.196 --> 01:55:03.436]  With 68 minutes of extras on the DVD.
[01:55:03.736 --> 01:55:05.617]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:05.657 --> 01:55:06.117]  Support us.
[01:55:07.688 --> 01:55:09.029]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:09.370 --> 01:55:11.131]  Again, it's $19.95.
[01:55:11.171 --> 01:55:19.098]  You can get them as low as $9.95 when you buy multiple copies of the DVD from Infowars.com.
[01:55:19.118 --> 01:55:19.558]  Get that.
[01:55:19.618 --> 01:55:20.719]  Make high-quality copies.
[01:55:20.759 --> 01:55:21.380]  Give it to people.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.601]  Give it as a Christmas present, a birthday present.
[01:55:23.661 --> 01:55:24.142]  Don't wait.
[01:55:24.242 --> 01:55:24.862]  Get them now.
[01:55:25.383 --> 01:55:27.565]  And your purchase also makes this broadcast possible.
[01:55:27.985 --> 01:55:30.047]  I'm asking you listeners to support us
[01:55:30.527 --> 01:55:30.927]  We're good to go.
[01:55:30.947 --> 01:55:31.108]  I think?
[01:55:58.229 --> 01:56:02.111]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:04.492 --> 01:56:11.035]  All right, I know that we have Leo and Joe and Joseph and Isaac and Michelle and others.
[01:56:11.055 --> 01:56:12.856]  Let's go to Joseph in England right now.
[01:56:13.276 --> 01:56:14.317]  Joseph, you're on the air.
[01:56:14.377 --> 01:56:14.977]  Thanks for holding.
[01:56:15.857 --> 01:56:16.318]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:16.438 --> 01:56:17.698]  Here in sunny England.
[01:56:18.139 --> 01:56:18.859]  Yeah, right, I wish.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.142]  Yeah, we've got a lot of 9-11 truth activism here in the UK.
[01:56:25.122 --> 01:56:29.963]  Last month alone we had three events that I attended that went down brilliantly.
[01:56:30.003 --> 01:56:36.085]  We had a film showing in Leeds with David Shaler that came to it and we thought if we had 40 or 50 people that would be good.
[01:56:36.125 --> 01:56:36.606]  Well, we had like 210.
[01:56:36.726 --> 01:56:42.487]  I'm just basically trying to get people in my area mobilised.
[01:56:42.547 --> 01:56:47.189]  I know that there's a lot of people that listen to your show over the internet in the Yorkshire area.
[01:56:47.759 --> 01:56:55.122]  So we basically wanted to say that we've got two events coming up next week with David Shaler, who's going to be coming to do a bit of a talk, and we're going to have a bit of a film showing.
[01:56:55.142 --> 01:56:59.523]  And if anybody wants to learn about this, they can go to cremationofcare.com.
[01:56:59.683 --> 01:57:00.763]  That's a great website.
[01:57:00.803 --> 01:57:01.964]  Great folks over there.
[01:57:02.764 --> 01:57:04.005]  Cremationofcare.com.
[01:57:04.025 --> 01:57:05.605]  You can also go to, like, 9-11 Blogger.
[01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:06.806]  They list all the big events.
[01:57:07.506 --> 01:57:15.188]  And I did see that Shaler's showing that new film about MI5, MI6 terrorism, and he speaks on 9-11.
[01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:15.869]  I haven't seen that.
[01:57:15.889 --> 01:57:16.649]  What's the name of it again?
[01:57:17.425 --> 01:57:20.446]  Short-changed, I think you mean, and there's another one called Mind the Gap.
[01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:21.887]  I can send you a copy if you want, Alex.
[01:57:22.527 --> 01:57:23.248]  I would love that.
[01:57:23.308 --> 01:57:31.371]  Thank you so much for the call from the United Kingdom, center of the New World Order, and one of the centers of resistance as well.
[01:57:33.392 --> 01:57:38.274]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:50.669]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:52.390]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.111 --> 01:57:54.231]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.872 --> 01:57:55.692]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.452 --> 01:57:57.353]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.013 --> 01:58:01.655]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.196 --> 01:58:06.298]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:16.994 --> 01:58:20.124]  The Alex Jones Show!
[01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:31.236]  Welcome, welcome, welcome now into the third and final hour of this live Wednesday, October 11, 2006 edition.
[01:58:31.716 --> 01:58:36.519]  Coming up in about a ten minute report will be Jason Bermas of the Loose Change crew.
[01:58:37.099 --> 01:58:39.861]  They are now having their video censored and it's been confirmed.
[01:58:39.881 --> 01:58:42.103]  In fact, when he called and said, what's happening to us?
[01:58:42.123 --> 01:58:45.525]  I said, let me guess, they're not erasing your numbers, they're freezing them.
[01:58:45.565 --> 01:58:47.466]  That's the new trick Google's pulling.
[01:58:47.486 --> 01:58:52.750]  And they've admitted to censorship and it's a big deal because on a level playing field, we'll clean the New World Order's clocks.
[01:58:54.994 --> 01:58:56.457]  But they gotta cheat, don't they?
[01:58:56.518 --> 01:58:58.341]  Well, we just gotta fight that much harder.
[01:58:58.502 --> 01:59:00.987]  So help us get the word out about Terror Storm, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:02.136 --> 01:59:03.977]  We've got wide open phones in this hour.
[01:59:04.017 --> 01:59:09.459]  I do have two little, one's four minutes, one's about five minutes of Keith Olbermann on fire Monday and Tuesday.
[01:59:10.459 --> 01:59:12.500]  I've never seen such courage on mainstream television.
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:13.900]  I don't know how he's getting away with it.
[01:59:14.321 --> 01:59:15.241]  We're going to play those.
[01:59:15.621 --> 01:59:18.122]  And I've had a lot of requests for those that missed it in the first hour.
[01:59:18.162 --> 01:59:25.065]  We will re-air the three-hour clip of the Libertarian for Senate out of Montana, Stan Jones, on C-SPAN.
[01:59:26.425 --> 01:59:28.686]  It happened live Monday, but it re-aired last night.
[01:59:29.246 --> 01:59:30.807]  Just incredible footage.
[01:59:31.914 --> 01:59:35.596]  Incredible, where he talks about the North American Union and the New World Order.
[01:59:35.616 --> 01:59:38.957]  We'll re-air that at the bottom of this hour, I promise.
[01:59:39.297 --> 01:59:41.478]  Right now, let's get all these great calls out of the way here.
[01:59:42.379 --> 01:59:46.601]  Let's talk to Leo in Illinois, then Joe and others.
[01:59:46.641 --> 01:59:46.981]  Go ahead.
[01:59:47.001 --> 01:59:49.342]  Alex?
[01:59:49.682 --> 01:59:49.902]  Yes.
[01:59:50.462 --> 01:59:53.204]  Yes, this is Leo from Chicago calling.
[01:59:53.224 --> 01:59:54.044]  First time caller.
[01:59:54.614 --> 01:59:57.376]  I'm a great follower, big fan.
[01:59:57.436 --> 02:00:09.785]  I know you're not into, you know, the cult, you know, personality thing, which is, you know, if you look at, like, the thing with Katie Couric, how it's such a big deal that she's, you know, becoming a news anchor.
[02:00:11.746 --> 02:00:12.767]  But that's all hype.
[02:00:12.827 --> 02:00:13.488]  That's all hype.
[02:00:13.508 --> 02:00:14.729]  Her ratings aren't even that high.
[02:00:14.769 --> 02:00:15.409]  She's a joke.
[02:00:16.170 --> 02:00:19.132]  It's all hype, but it's all about the messenger, not the message.
[02:00:20.052 --> 02:00:22.634]  It's all about how her dress looks instead of the information.
[02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:23.535]  Exactly.
[02:00:24.548 --> 02:00:29.451]  I wanted to make a comment about the Ashcroft thing.
[02:00:30.332 --> 02:00:36.015]  Something you could have brought up was what he's doing now, how he's profiting off of this police state security system.
[02:00:36.216 --> 02:00:38.377]  Well, I mean, we did bring that up.
[02:00:38.437 --> 02:00:44.301]  Mancow brought that up, and Ashcroft denied and said, no one's made money off this, and it's not for money, and that they want to end the war.
[02:00:44.481 --> 02:00:44.821]  Bull.
[02:00:44.881 --> 02:00:47.523]  They want to keep the war on terror going for 100 years.
[02:00:47.583 --> 02:00:48.263]  Bush has said it.
[02:00:48.884 --> 02:00:49.144]  Right.
[02:00:50.465 --> 02:00:50.725]  Right.
[02:00:50.865 --> 02:00:52.266]  So, I mean, that's something we could have brought up.
[02:00:52.951 --> 02:00:58.895]  I wanted to ask you and get your comment about the North American Union and the Fenley and Superhighway.
[02:00:59.055 --> 02:01:01.236]  Yeah, openly signed, openly happening.
[02:01:01.436 --> 02:01:04.018]  Our governments are meeting secretly in official government meetings.
[02:01:04.818 --> 02:01:04.998]  Right.
[02:01:06.502 --> 02:01:28.978]  Mostly I hear about how this is for free trade, to bring these goods in from China, but when you think about the history of the interstate system in this country, Eisenhower instituted that program to mobilize... It was originally designed to be a military transport and landing field system to defend against Russian bombardment and invasion, and so they claim they still own it today.
[02:01:29.901 --> 02:01:38.165]  Well, I'm thinking that this Pendling Superhighway, because the plan is obviously to implode our economy, you know, enslave the people, kill them off.
[02:01:38.726 --> 02:01:45.409]  I'm thinking that this Pendling Superhighway is more along the lines of a way of, you know, the same
[02:01:45.976 --> 02:01:50.760]  The idea that the Interstate Highway System was for military mobilization.
[02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:51.000]  Sure.
[02:01:51.441 --> 02:02:01.129]  Listen, it's romantic to think we're going to be invaded by troops like Red Dawn, but it's already happening with 30 million illegals caught by our government through funding to Mexico.
[02:02:01.169 --> 02:02:01.989]  This is Mexico.
[02:02:02.590 --> 02:02:04.431]  We're already being invaded by the Third World.
[02:02:04.451 --> 02:02:06.113]  We're already being invaded economically.
[02:02:06.493 --> 02:02:07.654]  We're already falling apart.
[02:02:07.674 --> 02:02:09.976]  We're already being bought up and subdivided and merged.
[02:02:10.576 --> 02:02:19.604]  So I see, and they've signed agreements, foreign troops physically ruling over us in our neighborhoods, but they won't have to march in.
[02:02:19.624 --> 02:02:21.025]  It'll just be here they are.
[02:02:22.166 --> 02:02:22.386]  Right.
[02:02:22.546 --> 02:02:24.267]  Well, and they could use that family and superhighways.
[02:02:24.788 --> 02:02:25.068]  Easily.
[02:02:25.408 --> 02:02:25.668]  Sure.
[02:02:26.529 --> 02:02:35.556]  That's for economic military attack to further deindustrialize and to tax you exorbitantly with international taxes to use it.
[02:02:36.217 --> 02:02:38.759]  It is a new blood supply system.
[02:02:39.583 --> 02:02:51.833]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.173 --> 02:02:54.075]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.475 --> 02:03:02.121]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.819 --> 02:03:09.862]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.262 --> 02:03:21.706]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.006 --> 02:03:25.507]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.968 --> 02:03:27.888]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:32.050]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:15.728 --> 02:05:16.128]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:05:46.747 --> 02:05:52.790]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:56.432]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.373 --> 02:06:05.036]  Already into the final hour of this transmission, two Keith Ullman clips coming up.
[02:06:06.087 --> 02:06:07.347]  We'll re-air one more time.
[02:06:07.367 --> 02:06:08.448]  We've got a lot of requests for it.
[02:06:08.788 --> 02:06:10.428]  The Stan Jones Libertarian for U.S.
[02:06:10.468 --> 02:06:18.570]  Senator out of Montana clip at the end of his closing comments at a televised debate by Montana PBS picked up by C-SPAN.
[02:06:19.730 --> 02:06:25.752]  We called C-SPAN to get it, but they said they don't have it because it was actually them just taking the feed off of PBS.
[02:06:25.812 --> 02:06:28.272]  So if somebody's got that, please get it to us in high quality.
[02:06:28.772 --> 02:06:30.873]  I want that for my North American Union film I'm making.
[02:06:32.193 --> 02:06:33.594]  Probably just get one from Stan Jones.
[02:06:33.614 --> 02:06:34.934]  I'm getting in contact with him.
[02:06:35.891 --> 02:06:36.871]  I'll get him on the show.
[02:06:36.891 --> 02:06:38.552]  I would imagine he has a copy.
[02:06:39.252 --> 02:06:42.113]  So that's what's coming up later in the broadcast.
[02:06:43.134 --> 02:06:44.654]  We'll be playing that clip again.
[02:06:44.774 --> 02:06:59.360]  And we've got, just briefly, to give us an update on censorship, Jason Burmess, Loose Change 2nd Edition, is now being censored as well, as Google widens its Chinese-style surveillance and censorship here in the United States and the Western world.
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:03.562]  In fact, let's just go ahead and go to one of the Keith Olbermann's now, so we don't run out of time.
[02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:04.182]  Then we'll go to...
[02:07:05.342 --> 02:07:10.764]  Joe and Isaac and Michelle and others that are patiently holding.
[02:07:11.864 --> 02:07:14.465]  Let's play the habeas corpus clip first.
[02:07:14.665 --> 02:07:16.326]  I forget, how long is this clip, Scott?
[02:07:17.586 --> 02:07:18.647]  How long is the habeas corpus?
[02:07:20.067 --> 02:07:22.108]  Okay, we can't play the whole thing then.
[02:07:22.148 --> 02:07:23.108]  It's longer than I thought.
[02:07:23.328 --> 02:07:24.528]  How long is the other one on...
[02:07:27.185 --> 02:07:27.686]  We're good to go.
[02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:28.466]  We're good to go.
[02:07:49.853 --> 02:07:52.974]  Because it was overturned two Fridays ago, publicly.
[02:07:53.354 --> 02:07:53.874]  So here it is.
[02:07:54.254 --> 02:07:58.495]  Coley's story began to break on the night of September 28th, exploding the following day.
[02:07:58.535 --> 02:08:01.655]  Many people may not have noticed the bill passed by the Senate that night.
[02:08:02.296 --> 02:08:09.517]  Our third story on the countdown tonight, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, and what it does to something called habeas corpus.
[02:08:10.057 --> 02:08:18.799]  And before we reduce the very term habeas corpus to something vaguely recalled as sounding kind of like the cornerstone of freedom, or maybe kind of like a character from Harry Potter...
[02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:21.942]  We thought a countdown special investigation was in order.
[02:08:22.383 --> 02:08:29.469]  Congress passed the Military Commissions Act to give Mr. Bush the power to deal effectively with America's enemies, those who seek to harm the country.
[02:08:29.890 --> 02:08:31.972]  He has been very clear about who he thinks that is.
[02:08:33.493 --> 02:08:38.978]  For people to leak that program and for a newspaper to publish it does great harm to the United States of America.
[02:08:39.339 --> 02:08:43.703]  The fact that we're discussing this program is helping the enemy.
[02:08:44.798 --> 02:08:51.743]  So the President said it was urgent that Congress send him this bill as quickly as possible, not for the politics of next month's elections, but for America.
[02:08:53.364 --> 02:08:55.106]  The need for this legislation is urgent.
[02:08:57.267 --> 02:09:06.534]  We need to ensure that those questioning terrorists can continue to do everything within the limits of the law to get information that can save American lives.
[02:09:08.616 --> 02:09:13.219]  My administration will continue to work with the Congress to get this legislation enacted,
[02:09:14.042 --> 02:09:15.362]  But time is of the essence.
[02:09:17.223 --> 02:09:22.365]  Congress is in session just for a few more weeks, and passing this legislation ought to be the top priority.
[02:09:23.005 --> 02:09:26.626]  The families of those murdered that day have waited patiently for justice.
[02:09:28.687 --> 02:09:30.047]  Some of the families are with us today.
[02:09:30.728 --> 02:09:32.268]  They should have to wait no longer.
[02:09:33.188 --> 02:09:40.451]  Because time was of the essence, and to ensure that the 9-11 families would wait no longer, as soon as he got the bill, the President whipped out his pen and immediately signed
[02:09:41.289 --> 02:09:45.199]  A statement saying he looks forward to signing the actual law eventually.
[02:09:46.030 --> 02:10:14.558]  He has not signed it yet, almost two weeks later, because, of course, he has been swamped by a series of campaign swings at which he has made up quotes from unnamed Democratic leaders, and because when he is actually at work, he's been signing so many other important bills, such as the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, the Third Higher Education Extension Act, ratification requests for extradition treaties with Malta, Estonia, and Latvia, his proclamation of German American Day, the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act, and his proclamation of Leif Erikson Day.
[02:10:15.606 --> 02:10:24.293]  Still, getting the Military Commissions Act to the President so he could immediately mull it over for two weeks was so important, some members of Congress did not even read the bill before voting on it.
[02:10:24.834 --> 02:10:27.616]  Thus, as some of its minutiae, escaped scrutiny.
[02:10:28.156 --> 02:10:38.805]  One bit of trivia that caught our eye was the elimination of habeas corpus, which apparently used to be the right of anyone who's tossed in prison to appear in court and say, Hey, why am I in prison?
[02:10:41.007 --> 02:10:43.549]  Why does habeas corpus hate America?
[02:10:44.278 --> 02:10:47.082]  And how is it so bad for us?
[02:10:47.122 --> 02:10:49.926]  Mr. Bush says it gets in the way of him doing his job.
[02:10:50.066 --> 02:10:55.933]  This legislation passed in the House yesterday is a part of making sure that we do have the capacity to protect you.
[02:10:57.536 --> 02:10:58.497]  Our most solemn job
[02:11:00.248 --> 02:11:01.589]  It's the security of this country.
[02:11:02.009 --> 02:11:05.932]  It may be solemn, but is that really his job?
[02:11:06.352 --> 02:11:13.036]  In this rarely seen footage, Mr. Bush seems to be describing a different job.
[02:11:13.156 --> 02:11:16.438]  Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[02:11:16.818 --> 02:11:31.475]  Countdown has obtained a copy of this Constitution of the United States, and sources tell us it was originally sneaked through the Constitutional Convention and state ratification in order to establish America's fundamental legal principles.
[02:11:32.139 --> 02:11:36.261]  But this so-called Constitution is frustratingly vague about the right to trial.
[02:11:36.621 --> 02:11:39.542]  In fact, there's only one reference to habeas corpus at all.
[02:11:39.982 --> 02:11:50.647]  Quoting, "...the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it."
[02:11:51.758 --> 02:11:58.550]  But even Democrats who voted against the Military Commissions Act concede that it doesn't actually suspend habeas corpus.
[02:11:58.711 --> 02:12:02.257]  The bill before us would not merely suspend the Great Red.
[02:12:02.918 --> 02:12:03.659]  The Great Red.
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:04.962]  The Red of habeas corpus.
[02:12:05.586 --> 02:12:07.227]  It just eliminates it permanently.
[02:12:07.447 --> 02:12:15.252]  And there is considerable debate whether the conditions for suspending habeas corpus, rebellion or invasion, have even been met.
[02:12:15.392 --> 02:12:19.035]  Conditions for suspending habeas corpus have not been met.
[02:12:19.055 --> 02:12:22.557]  We do not have a rebellion or an invasion.
[02:12:22.777 --> 02:12:23.978]  Well, we're not in a rebellion.
[02:12:24.498 --> 02:12:25.779]  Nor are we being invaded.
[02:12:26.179 --> 02:12:28.181]  Okay, maybe the debate wasn't that considerable.
[02:12:28.501 --> 02:12:39.468]  Nevertheless, Countdown has learned that habeas corpus actually predates the Constitution, meaning it's not just pre-September 11th thinking, it's also pre-July 4th thinking.
[02:12:40.109 --> 02:12:46.273]  In those days, no one could have imagined that enemy combatants might one day attack Americans on native soil.
[02:12:47.140 --> 02:13:09.248]  In fact, Countdown has obtained a partially redacted copy of a colonial declaration indicating that back then, depriving us of trial by jury was actually considered sufficient cause to start a war of independence based on the then fashionable idea that, quote, liberty, unquote, was an unalienable right.
[02:13:09.961 --> 02:13:18.174]  But today, thanks to modern post-9-11 thinking, those rights are now fully alienable for your protection.
[02:13:20.774 --> 02:13:24.497]  The reality is, without habeas corpus, a lot of other rights lose their meaning.
[02:13:24.517 --> 02:13:30.742]  But if you look at the actual Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to that pesky Constitution, you'll see just how many remain for your protection.
[02:13:30.762 --> 02:13:32.443]  Well, okay, number one's gone.
[02:13:32.463 --> 02:13:39.029]  I mean, if you're detained without trial, you'll lose your freedom of religion and speech, press, assembly, all of that.
[02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:40.010]  So you don't need that one anymore.
[02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:42.972]  And, you know, you can't petition the government for anything.
[02:13:43.467 --> 02:13:43.929]  Number two?
[02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:50.627]  Well, while you're in prison, your right to keep and bear arms just might be infringed upon, even if you're in the NRA.
[02:13:50.667 --> 02:13:51.429]  So that's gone.
[02:13:51.530 --> 02:13:51.690]  Three?
[02:13:52.611 --> 02:13:55.613]  Well, okay, no forced sleepovers at your house by soldiers.
[02:13:56.073 --> 02:13:56.553]  Three's all right.
[02:13:57.074 --> 02:14:04.498]  Four, you're definitely not secure against searches and seizures, as it says here, with or without probable cause.
[02:14:05.138 --> 02:14:08.980]  And in prison, that's not even limited to just the guards, so forget the fourth.
[02:14:09.381 --> 02:14:13.243]  Five, grand juries and due process, obviously out, so forget five.
[02:14:13.643 --> 02:14:14.844]  And the little trailer up here.
[02:14:15.204 --> 02:14:18.926]  Six, well, trials are gone, too, let alone the right to counsel.
[02:14:19.486 --> 02:14:20.327]  Speedy trials?
[02:14:21.147 --> 02:14:21.848]  You want it when?
[02:14:22.674 --> 02:14:22.994]  Seven.
[02:14:23.014 --> 02:14:28.336]  Well, this is about... I thought we just covered trials and juries earlier, so forget the seventh.
[02:14:28.996 --> 02:14:29.216]  Eight.
[02:14:30.576 --> 02:14:30.857]  Bail.
[02:14:30.937 --> 02:14:32.537]  Well, bail's kind of a moot point, isn't it?
[02:14:33.737 --> 02:14:34.338]  And nine.
[02:14:34.718 --> 02:14:36.298]  Other rights retained by the people.
[02:14:36.358 --> 02:14:40.439]  Well, you know, if you can name them during your waterboarding, we'll consider them.
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:41.200]  Ten.
[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:44.921]  Power is not delegated to the United States federal government.
[02:14:45.741 --> 02:14:47.281]  Well, they seem to have ended up there anyway.
[02:14:48.162 --> 02:14:52.163]  So, as you can see, even without habeas corpus, at least one-tenth of the Bill of Rights...
[02:14:52.952 --> 02:14:54.274]  I guess that's the bill right now.
[02:14:56.497 --> 02:14:57.739]  Remains virtually intact.
[02:14:57.799 --> 02:14:59.402]  Number three is still safe.
[02:14:59.702 --> 02:15:07.093]  We can rest easy knowing that we will never ever have to quarter soldiers in our homes as long as the Third Amendment still stands strong.
[02:15:08.376 --> 02:15:10.376]  President can just take care of that with a signing statement.
[02:15:10.837 --> 02:15:11.217]  All right.
[02:15:11.737 --> 02:15:13.917]  Again, it's a cruddy Internet clip.
[02:15:13.957 --> 02:15:15.658]  We apologize, but it's important to play that.
[02:15:15.678 --> 02:15:21.219]  We've got one more clip where he gets into Rumsfeld arming the North Koreans with the nukes.
[02:15:21.239 --> 02:15:25.040]  That's publicly admitted for anybody that wants to search that out.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:32.781]  As I told you, the legislation that passed last week not only gets rid of the Habeas Corpus that is the linchpin of the entire Bill of Rights.
[02:15:32.801 --> 02:15:34.982]  If you get rid of that, I mean, the whole thing's moot.
[02:15:36.750 --> 02:15:44.800]  In New Orleans, they did quarter trips in homes, they did confiscate guns, a National Guardsman shot and killed somebody who didn't even have a gun, just got out of his car and argued.
[02:15:46.054 --> 02:15:47.655]  Now it turns out he had a flashlight in his hands.
[02:15:47.675 --> 02:15:48.396]  They blew him away.
[02:15:48.856 --> 02:15:50.537]  So actually, you do have to quarter troops.
[02:15:50.818 --> 02:15:54.561]  And that was also really seen as a tax to pay for the troops' housing.
[02:15:54.601 --> 02:15:57.103]  So it was not just keeping them in your house.
[02:15:57.503 --> 02:15:59.104]  So there is no third either.
[02:15:59.125 --> 02:16:02.647]  And of course, that's only one area of H.R.
[02:16:02.667 --> 02:16:02.647]  6166.
[02:16:02.788 --> 02:16:11.435]  If you look at some of the other subsections on enemy combatant designation and punishments, it says damaging private property, going on to government property,
[02:16:12.455 --> 02:16:17.599]  Basically demonstrating not having total allegiance to the government and everything it says and does.
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.782]  Judges are traitors if they ever question any of it.
[02:16:21.342 --> 02:16:23.804]  So it's much worse than what Oberman is saying.
[02:16:25.165 --> 02:16:26.406]  This is not piecemeal.
[02:16:26.486 --> 02:16:28.528]  This is martial law enabling acts.
[02:16:28.548 --> 02:16:29.969]  Now the question is, will they try to implement this?
[02:16:30.329 --> 02:16:32.631]  They already are for years, long before George Bush.
[02:16:33.051 --> 02:16:35.974]  You know, the cops want to search your car without a warrant, checkpoints.
[02:16:36.454 --> 02:16:37.755]  Stuff like that's total treason.
[02:16:38.991 --> 02:16:41.233]  But our policy says we will.
[02:16:41.913 --> 02:16:47.977]  It's to keep you safe from the rugs that the government allied crime syndicate ships in.
[02:16:48.497 --> 02:16:49.898]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:16:49.958 --> 02:16:50.599]  I'm sick of it.
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:17:01.325]  In other news, Army is saying, telling the Washington Post, that troops to stay in Iraq until 2010, that's old news, they'll be there in 30 years, folks, study 655,000 Iraqis dead during war, Associated Press reports,
[02:17:07.632 --> 02:17:15.296]  The study of nearly 655,000 Iraqis have died because of the war, suggesting a far higher death toll than other estimates.
[02:17:15.756 --> 02:17:17.677]  The timing of the survey released just weeks before the U.S.
[02:17:17.697 --> 02:17:18.617]  Congressional elections.
[02:17:20.178 --> 02:17:26.501]  And it goes on to say the study researchers attempted to calculate how many more Iraqis have died since March 2003 than one would expect without the war.
[02:17:27.621 --> 02:17:30.642]  And it's conservatively 200,000, but it might be 600,000.
[02:17:30.763 --> 02:17:32.743]  It's freedom, folks.
[02:17:32.783 --> 02:17:33.224]  It's freedom.
[02:17:34.504 --> 02:17:36.165]  But again, Iraq deserves it.
[02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.136]  We've got to kill them.
[02:17:38.176 --> 02:17:40.878]  But North Korea threatened to nuke us and being able to, that's good.
[02:17:40.898 --> 02:17:42.739]  We're going to leave them alone.
[02:17:42.759 --> 02:17:44.160]  It's Iran that's the problem.
[02:17:46.421 --> 02:17:49.623]  You know, I really wish I could just power my place with solar.
[02:17:51.242 --> 02:17:57.425]  That's what I was saying to myself over and over again for years until I found out about Ken Solar.
[02:17:57.745 --> 02:18:04.328]  Ken has been working with solar power for over a decade and has designed systems for people all over the world.
[02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:13.773]  He's put together customized alternative energy packages for everything from powering the local supermarket all the way down to portable solar power generators.
[02:18:14.353 --> 02:18:25.501]  On-grid, off-grid, big systems or tiny systems, Ken has the proven experience to design a tailored alternative energy system that's just right for you and your budget.
[02:18:25.881 --> 02:18:30.144]  He'll also show you how a system can pay for itself in the first month.
[02:18:30.544 --> 02:18:33.326]  So if you're looking for solar, check out Ken Solar.
[02:18:33.566 --> 02:18:38.890]  Tell Ken you heard about him on GCN and he'll give you an additional 10% off your order.
[02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:42.092]  Just point your browser at Kensolar.com.
[02:18:42.132 --> 02:18:43.793]  That's Ken Solar.
[02:18:45.394 --> 02:18:46.615]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[02:18:46.675 --> 02:18:47.516]  Today is October 11, 2006.
[02:18:47.576 --> 02:18:50.358]  Gold opened at $574.20 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $605.64.
[02:18:50.458 --> 02:18:52.740]  Again, that's $605.64 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[02:18:59.282 --> 02:19:01.964]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[02:19:02.425 --> 02:19:07.068]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:08.870]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[02:19:09.330 --> 02:19:12.473]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[02:19:12.853 --> 02:19:18.297]  We, the people, labor to create the money, only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[02:19:18.697 --> 02:19:24.362]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[02:19:24.762 --> 02:19:29.667]  Midas Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.

[02:20:32.825 --> 02:20:35.507]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[02:20:38.328 --> 02:20:41.094]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:47.645 --> 02:20:51.768]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:20:52.008 --> 02:20:53.769]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:20:54.030 --> 02:21:00.314]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:21:00.614 --> 02:21:06.738]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:21:06.979 --> 02:21:13.003]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:13.303 --> 02:21:19.707]  With no side effects, the 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:21:19.847 --> 02:21:23.389]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:21:23.689 --> 02:21:27.392]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:21:27.572 --> 02:21:30.113]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:21:30.253 --> 02:21:31.314]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:21:31.514 --> 02:21:32.615]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[02:21:32.775 --> 02:21:35.717]  Got another Obermann clip coming up later concerning Rumsfeld arming the good old boys.
[02:21:35.737 --> 02:21:36.518]  They're in North Korea.
[02:22:00.581 --> 02:22:04.883]  Old news to you, the audience, but new news from MSNBC, and we appreciate the courage of Oberman to cover it.
[02:22:05.423 --> 02:22:08.965]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Canada.
[02:22:09.325 --> 02:22:09.966]  Welcome, Joe.
[02:22:10.366 --> 02:22:10.926]  Hello, Alex.
[02:22:11.206 --> 02:22:11.546]  Hi.
[02:22:12.087 --> 02:22:15.448]  Yeah, I wanted to go over about five points, then a question.
[02:22:15.968 --> 02:22:17.029]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:22:17.169 --> 02:22:26.293]  Okay, I did a little bit of studying on the Kennedy assassination, and I came to the conclusion that Greer did it, that he covered it up until he died in 1985, which is like a 22-year cover-up.
[02:22:28.875 --> 02:22:33.557]  And George Herbert Walker Bush has been covering it up for 43 years in hopes to take it to the grave with him.
[02:22:34.737 --> 02:22:36.478]  And he's been doing this stuff for five decades.
[02:22:37.618 --> 02:22:44.321]  And my next point is, Nextel, do you recall the 9-11 movie, the documentary, the Naughty Brothers?
[02:22:45.081 --> 02:22:45.361]  Yes.
[02:22:46.002 --> 02:22:48.883]  Yeah, I noticed some clips were missing from that movie.
[02:22:49.443 --> 02:22:49.963]  Did you notice that?
[02:22:50.783 --> 02:22:52.044]  I don't really know what you're talking about.
[02:22:52.244 --> 02:22:57.866]  Yeah, do you remember the firemen in the firehouse discussing what it seemed like to be controlled demolition?
[02:22:58.465 --> 02:23:00.426]  Oh, you're saying they re-released it and removed that?
[02:23:00.707 --> 02:23:00.927]  Yeah.
[02:23:01.867 --> 02:23:02.648]  That's one of the clips.
[02:23:02.728 --> 02:23:09.372]  Another one of the clips was one of the firemen was outside the building and his face was all bloody and he said he heard explosions.
[02:23:09.813 --> 02:23:10.753]  Yeah, I've gotten emails.
[02:23:10.793 --> 02:23:13.775]  They had some fifth anniversary one that aired in England and the U.S.
[02:23:13.855 --> 02:23:15.837]  and it cut out all the key stuff.
[02:23:15.857 --> 02:23:17.078]  Isn't that suspicious?
[02:23:17.298 --> 02:23:17.898]  Very weird.
[02:23:18.278 --> 02:23:21.841]  And if it's just, you know, an anomaly, leave the firemen in sand bombs.
[02:23:22.581 --> 02:23:23.622]  Oh, take it out.
[02:23:23.742 --> 02:23:24.462]  Yeah, why?
[02:23:25.543 --> 02:23:27.885]  Okay, and then I was reading Looking Forward.
[02:23:29.028 --> 02:23:31.610]  And I got a quote from George Herbert, again.
[02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:38.074]  Quote, the violence and terrorism, the warfare between Christians and Muslims would soon come to an end.
[02:23:39.374 --> 02:23:39.775]  Unquote.
[02:23:41.316 --> 02:23:41.636]  Okay.
[02:23:41.936 --> 02:23:46.559]  I thought that was pretty suspicious, being that what's happening with the Muslims over there, eh?
[02:23:46.619 --> 02:23:46.799]  Sure.
[02:23:46.819 --> 02:23:48.000]  And trying to put the blame on the Christians.
[02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:54.584]  And then another quote, this one's from his son there, 9.30 in the morning on September 11th.
[02:23:55.284 --> 02:23:58.046]  Quote, we have had a national tragedy...
[02:23:58.652 --> 02:24:03.913]  Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country.
[02:24:04.213 --> 02:24:05.953]  Thus begins the conditioning of the masses.
[02:24:07.354 --> 02:24:07.574]  Sure.
[02:24:07.594 --> 02:24:08.654]  My little statement at the end there.
[02:24:10.314 --> 02:24:18.416]  And in the same book, which is actually... They tell you not to print anything without their permission, but I just went ahead with it anyways.
[02:24:18.456 --> 02:24:23.937]  That at 5.20, WTC 7 collapses and nearby buildings remain ablaze, but don't collapse like WTC 7.
[02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:25.600]  All right.
[02:24:25.961 --> 02:24:27.242]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:24:28.002 --> 02:24:32.646]  Let's go ahead and take another call from Isaac in Texas.
[02:24:32.686 --> 02:24:33.046]  Welcome.
[02:24:34.567 --> 02:24:34.687]  Hello?
[02:24:35.008 --> 02:24:35.248]  Yes.
[02:24:36.189 --> 02:24:36.889]  Hey, Alex.
[02:24:37.470 --> 02:24:44.395]  I just want to talk to you about the situation in North Korea with the apparent dud that went off, the 200 pounds of TNT.
[02:24:44.635 --> 02:24:53.122]  Yes, the trusted source, Bill Gertz, I mean that sarcastically, saying it's a dud, the New York Times saying it may be, and the government saying they don't know.
[02:24:53.142 --> 02:24:53.802]  200 pounds...
[02:24:55.922 --> 02:25:00.345]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:25:00.446 --> 02:25:11.433]  The point I want to make is back when we dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, we didn't even actually test that design on that bomb.
[02:25:11.453 --> 02:25:14.155]  The gun type that we dropped on Hiroshima, we just dropped it.
[02:25:14.355 --> 02:25:15.276]  It wasn't even tested.
[02:25:16.296 --> 02:25:22.801]  And the fact that somebody 60 years after we dropped that bomb, they can't get it right, that doesn't make sense to me.
[02:25:24.528 --> 02:25:28.670]  Well, there's some people running around saying no one has nukes but the U.S., and it's not true.
[02:25:29.931 --> 02:25:34.213]  Well, also, this actually leads into something else I want to bring up.
[02:25:34.273 --> 02:25:41.197]  When that happened, and now since everybody's going to be like, oh, since North Korea has nukes, you're going to give them to Iran, so we've got to invade Iran, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:25:41.957 --> 02:25:50.140]  And already the United States Army and Navy and Air Force are having trouble recruiting people, so the only way I see in a few years is a draft coming about.
[02:25:50.621 --> 02:25:51.561]  Well, no, you're right.
[02:25:51.581 --> 02:25:53.282]  They've set up the draft boards.
[02:25:53.342 --> 02:25:57.744]  They're calling it now National Compulsory Service.
[02:25:57.784 --> 02:25:59.864]  They go, no, no, no, it's National Compulsory Service.
[02:26:00.185 --> 02:26:02.506]  It's not a draft because they've changed the name.
[02:26:03.606 --> 02:26:05.787]  You see, that's how they treat us, like little children.
[02:26:07.171 --> 02:26:07.471]  Okay.
[02:26:08.212 --> 02:26:10.313]  It's not a shot.
[02:26:10.373 --> 02:26:11.774]  It's an inoculation.
[02:26:11.794 --> 02:26:22.880]  Well, it was the final blow to me to convince myself to go get myself a passport because as much as I love America, I don't love Bush and I don't love Cheney and I don't love Halliburton.
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:24.701]  Well, you should go to Iraq and Iran.
[02:26:24.721 --> 02:26:30.945]  You should breathe DU, take deadly injections, be ripped off when your legs are blown off, have your family have to pay to fly you back.
[02:26:31.365 --> 02:26:32.286]  That's patriotism.
[02:26:32.306 --> 02:26:34.927]  You can wrap yourself in a big plastic flag made by slaves.
[02:26:35.168 --> 02:26:35.628]  How's that sound?
[02:26:36.656 --> 02:26:38.417]  I don't know if I actually would get flown back.
[02:26:38.477 --> 02:26:39.317]  My parents would see me.
[02:26:39.377 --> 02:26:40.798]  I've heard that that doesn't happen.
[02:26:40.818 --> 02:26:43.819]  What do you mean, flown back?
[02:26:43.839 --> 02:26:44.479]  I don't understand.
[02:26:44.499 --> 02:26:45.520]  What's that?
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:46.820]  You've heard what doesn't happen.
[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:55.043]  That when a soldier is killed in Iraq, that the parents are not allowed to see the body.
[02:26:55.103 --> 02:26:56.324]  I've heard it.
[02:26:56.904 --> 02:26:57.845]  It's very vague in my mind.
[02:26:57.865 --> 02:26:58.725]  That's not what I said.
[02:26:58.785 --> 02:27:02.707]  I said when your legs get blown off, you have to a lot of times pay for your own flight back.
[02:27:03.267 --> 02:27:04.847]  They discharge you at the base.
[02:27:05.308 --> 02:27:06.188]  They're so cheap.
[02:27:06.852 --> 02:27:16.359]  They'll pay billions for each bomber, but they're so cheap that they will make you pay for your own flight back and $4 a day for your own meals when your legs are blown off.
[02:27:16.379 --> 02:27:17.060]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:18.401 --> 02:27:19.501]  That was the point I was making.
[02:27:20.682 --> 02:27:21.823]  And that's a fact, by the way.
[02:27:21.843 --> 02:27:23.764]  That's been in a score of mainstream papers.
[02:27:24.225 --> 02:27:25.085]  That is admitted.
[02:27:25.105 --> 02:27:29.008]  And when you tell that to a Bushite, they go, well, that's just the way it is.
[02:27:29.068 --> 02:27:30.349]  George Bush knows best.
[02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:32.451]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.067 --> 02:27:36.988]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.468 --> 02:27:39.069]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.089 --> 02:27:42.791]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.753 --> 02:27:49.795]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:50.015 --> 02:27:53.417]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.597 --> 02:27:56.999]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:57.327 --> 02:28:00.590]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:00.610 --> 02:28:06.075]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:06.115 --> 02:28:15.744]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:15.864 --> 02:28:17.245]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:28:17.265 --> 02:28:22.650]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:23.127 --> 02:28:27.568]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:27.588 --> 02:28:29.029]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:29.189 --> 02:28:33.850]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?
[02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:33.930]  1-877-928-8822
[02:28:45.717 --> 02:28:47.557]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:28:47.898 --> 02:28:49.418]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:28:49.838 --> 02:28:50.098]  What?
[02:28:50.438 --> 02:28:50.798]  Again?
[02:28:51.218 --> 02:28:52.839]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:28:52.919 --> 02:28:57.340]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:28:58.860]  Why did you do that?
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:04.862]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:29:05.162 --> 02:29:06.182]  Are we there yet?
[02:29:06.302 --> 02:29:07.382]  for the entire trip.
[02:29:07.602 --> 02:29:09.803]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:29:10.283 --> 02:29:11.283]  Great idea.
[02:29:11.303 --> 02:29:14.144]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:29:14.542 --> 02:29:17.007]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:29:17.208 --> 02:29:21.596]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:29:21.877 --> 02:29:22.178]  Honey?
[02:29:23.004 --> 02:29:24.245]  You're terrific!
[02:29:24.645 --> 02:29:26.125]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:29:26.245 --> 02:29:29.647]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:29:29.927 --> 02:29:30.708]  Now can we stop?
[02:29:31.208 --> 02:29:31.948]  I need to go, too.
[02:29:32.248 --> 02:29:36.710]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.810 --> 02:29:37.170]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:38.671]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:45.822 --> 02:29:48.323]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:29:48.423 --> 02:29:50.805]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:29:50.865 --> 02:29:57.948]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[02:29:58.528 --> 02:30:00.830]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:05.012]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:30:05.572 --> 02:30:09.694]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:30:10.274 --> 02:30:13.236]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:30:14.221 --> 02:30:17.142]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:30:17.883 --> 02:30:23.865]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:24.125 --> 02:30:27.667]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:28.447 --> 02:30:31.789]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[02:30:31.869 --> 02:30:34.770]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:38.031]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:30:38.091 --> 02:30:42.293]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[02:30:42.633 --> 02:30:43.594]  And ask for George.
[02:30:46.599 --> 02:30:51.742]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.402 --> 02:30:54.784]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:09.372]  We'll be going to Jason Burmess with just a quick little update in a moment.
[02:31:09.532 --> 02:31:13.174]  Of course, with the three guys with the Loose Change crew, Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[02:31:13.874 --> 02:31:15.395]  They're now being censored by Google.
[02:31:17.106 --> 02:31:17.967]  Very important.
[02:31:18.847 --> 02:31:34.516]  And I'm asking all of you that are tuning in right now, who have computers, to aggressively, this is a war, this is a fight, to email your whole email list, to go on message boards, to tell people at work, to do banner hangs, you know, Google Terror Storm.
[02:31:35.376 --> 02:31:36.417]  Watch Terror Storm.
[02:31:36.457 --> 02:31:37.798]  I mean, get aggressive.
[02:31:38.698 --> 02:31:39.939]  They're afraid of Terror Storm.
[02:31:39.959 --> 02:31:42.760]  That's why they started censoring about three weeks ago.
[02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:44.341]  They've admitted twice they've done it.
[02:31:44.741 --> 02:31:45.782]  They go in and delete posts.
[02:31:46.351 --> 02:31:46.831]  We're good to go.
[02:32:16.165 --> 02:32:17.086]  We're good to go.
[02:32:17.106 --> 02:32:17.286]  I think?
[02:32:33.434 --> 02:32:34.095]  It's huge.
[02:33:01.457 --> 02:33:02.518]  And we want to reach people.
[02:33:02.578 --> 02:33:03.398]  That's the goal.
[02:33:03.438 --> 02:33:05.819]  That's why I make an expensive film.
[02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:09.781]  I didn't spend $6,000 to do it on Loose Change 2.
[02:33:10.621 --> 02:33:11.381]  I wish I would have.
[02:33:11.862 --> 02:33:15.503]  I spent close to $100,000 and I made it and I put it out for free.
[02:33:18.044 --> 02:33:19.325]  Don't let them get away with it.
[02:33:19.405 --> 02:33:20.985]  It's on YouTube, which they've now bought.
[02:33:21.226 --> 02:33:22.566]  Go get our YouTube version of it.
[02:33:22.586 --> 02:33:24.247]  Go get our Google version of it.
[02:33:24.547 --> 02:33:25.788]  They haven't taken them down yet.
[02:33:25.828 --> 02:33:26.928]  That might be coming next.
[02:33:27.088 --> 02:33:28.329]  Upload more copies of it.
[02:33:28.369 --> 02:33:29.109]  Just get aggressive.
[02:33:29.987 --> 02:33:40.490]  And tell everybody you know, hey, they're censoring this, and go out to the four corners of the Internet, and, I mean, ABC News blog, go to their comment sections, go everywhere.
[02:33:41.310 --> 02:33:42.450]  Tell people what's happening.
[02:33:42.490 --> 02:33:43.950]  Give them the link to Terror Storm.
[02:33:44.291 --> 02:33:44.891]  Help us!
[02:33:46.271 --> 02:33:50.032]  Because Terror Storm hadn't been downloaded 30 million times like Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[02:33:50.552 --> 02:33:51.552]  I want it to be seen.
[02:33:51.592 --> 02:33:53.633]  I want Loose Change to be seen another 30 million times.
[02:33:53.933 --> 02:33:57.994]  But it isn't going to be on Google Video, the main source, if they continue this chicanery.
[02:33:59.323 --> 02:34:01.905]  Google has complied with China on total censorship.
[02:34:02.146 --> 02:34:03.406]  They're complying with Europe now.
[02:34:03.687 --> 02:34:05.368]  They openly admit they're censoring here.
[02:34:05.728 --> 02:34:08.170]  I've got an article here out of Mainstream News.
[02:34:09.108 --> 02:34:10.029]  We're registered today.
[02:34:10.669 --> 02:34:13.291]  Yahoo, IBM blocking YouTube URLs.
[02:34:13.311 --> 02:34:14.492]  They're all blocking each other.
[02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:16.493]  This is the end of net neutrality.
[02:34:16.513 --> 02:34:18.174]  There's all sorts of stuff going on.
[02:34:18.555 --> 02:34:21.657]  So while we can still use the web, get the truth out.
[02:34:21.777 --> 02:34:22.858]  Terror storm.
[02:34:23.358 --> 02:34:24.159]  Tell everybody.
[02:34:24.199 --> 02:34:25.440]  Call into every Patriot show.
[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:26.380]  I want to hear you folks.
[02:34:26.781 --> 02:34:28.322]  I want to hear you call into the other networks.
[02:34:28.362 --> 02:34:30.003]  I want to hear you call into other mainstream shows.
[02:34:30.283 --> 02:34:30.703]  Help me.
[02:34:30.803 --> 02:34:31.524]  I can't do it all.
[02:34:32.373 --> 02:34:33.853]  I usually don't look for interviews.
[02:34:33.913 --> 02:34:35.174]  I usually just do them when they come in.
[02:34:35.654 --> 02:34:38.994]  When they started censoring me, I said, call every show we've been on, book me.
[02:34:39.435 --> 02:34:41.035]  Call all the Patriot shows, book me.
[02:34:41.195 --> 02:34:42.655]  You're going to hear me calling into shows.
[02:34:42.675 --> 02:34:43.755]  You're going to hear me everywhere.
[02:34:44.816 --> 02:34:49.757]  When somebody tries to suppress me and suppress my information, I always expand.
[02:34:50.057 --> 02:34:52.077]  When they hack a website, we start another one.
[02:34:53.037 --> 02:34:53.638]  That's our rule.
[02:34:53.658 --> 02:34:55.298]  You cut off one arm, we grow two.
[02:34:56.109 --> 02:34:57.851]  You cut off our head, we grow three.
[02:34:58.552 --> 02:35:03.657]  And we teach them that way that every time they hit us, we come back that much harder.
[02:35:04.805 --> 02:35:06.005]  And I want you to do this right now.
[02:35:06.025 --> 02:35:07.466]  I want you to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:35:07.486 --> 02:35:08.766]  We need your financial support.
[02:35:09.006 --> 02:35:12.307]  We need you to make films like this and get high-quality DVDs of Terror Storm.
[02:35:12.607 --> 02:35:14.827]  We've got big discounts on them when you get multiple copies.
[02:35:15.067 --> 02:35:17.148]  You want to be a mass distributor and help us get them out?
[02:35:17.248 --> 02:35:19.588]  I want you to call my office right now, extension 51-512-291-5750.
[02:35:19.608 --> 02:35:20.188]  512-291-5750, extension 51.
[02:35:20.228 --> 02:35:22.709]  They don't answer, leave your name and number.
[02:35:22.729 --> 02:35:24.189]  I want you to get 100 copies from us.
[02:35:32.151 --> 02:35:34.252]  I want you to get a thousand copies if you can afford it.
[02:35:34.593 --> 02:35:36.654]  Or I want you to go tell the four winds about it.
[02:35:36.814 --> 02:35:41.397]  I want you to go get a prisonplanet.tv membership and get it in a lot better internet quality than you'll get at Google.
[02:35:41.597 --> 02:35:42.517]  Fifteen cents a day.
[02:35:42.737 --> 02:35:43.598]  You've got a good connection.
[02:35:43.638 --> 02:35:45.259]  You can download it in super high quality.
[02:35:45.299 --> 02:35:45.999]  Burn it to disk.
[02:35:46.279 --> 02:35:47.340]  Give it to people that way.
[02:35:48.321 --> 02:35:49.942]  Use that prisonplanet.tv.
[02:35:51.202 --> 02:35:54.664]  We'll give all this stuff out for free and try to do it, but we do need some support.
[02:35:54.864 --> 02:35:55.185]  Okay?
[02:35:55.265 --> 02:35:56.666]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[02:35:56.686 --> 02:35:57.326]  Get a membership.
[02:35:58.285 --> 02:36:04.161]  Also, you can go to InfoWars.com to order all my DVDs, the other films we carry, Loose Change 2nd Edition on DVD.
[02:36:04.401 --> 02:36:06.326]  You support us, you support the Loose Change guys.
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:08.320]  It's just so important.
[02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:21.484]  All right, Jason, you've been holding while I've been ranting, but I want folks to call 512-291-5750, extension 51, and become mass warfare specialists with these weapons, these info bombs.
[02:36:21.804 --> 02:36:28.025]  I want everybody to call the toll-free number and get the videos, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:36:28.285 --> 02:36:29.806]  We will not be stopped.
[02:36:30.146 --> 02:36:31.966]  All right, going back to Jason.
[02:36:32.346 --> 02:36:33.887]  Jason, good to talk to you again, my friend.
[02:36:34.227 --> 02:36:35.087]  Good to talk to you too, Alex.
[02:36:36.557 --> 02:36:41.100]  Starting when I learned three weeks ago, obviously, that they were deleting my numbers and not you guys and not others.
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:47.464]  And then I guess now they've started some new thing, and it's not... It's only Patriot Truth 9-11 videos.
[02:36:47.925 --> 02:36:51.287]  Now you've caught them and you've sent us the screenshots to Paul Watson.
[02:36:51.307 --> 02:36:52.508]  We're going to do an article on this.
[02:36:52.608 --> 02:36:54.509]  Now they are freezing your numbers.
[02:36:54.529 --> 02:36:55.310]  What do you think is going on?
[02:36:56.011 --> 02:37:03.816]  Well, you know, I noticed a couple days that we were knocked out of the top 100, and I thought that that was kind of bizarre because we were really, you know, riding high, usually not out of the top 10 too much.
[02:37:04.236 --> 02:37:04.877]  You know, we were riding...
[02:37:05.731 --> 02:37:06.532]  Three versions of us.
[02:37:07.172 --> 02:37:11.496]  And then all of a sudden, you know, I go over and I say, all right, we're out of there.
[02:37:11.516 --> 02:37:12.397]  Let me check out my stats.
[02:37:12.417 --> 02:37:15.019]  And I'm seeing my last seven-day stats to 131,000 views.
[02:37:15.059 --> 02:37:17.241]  And I'm like, all right, that makes sense.
[02:37:17.261 --> 02:37:18.702]  So let me see how many I got for yesterday.
[02:37:18.962 --> 02:37:19.683]  And it was zero.
[02:37:20.263 --> 02:37:25.167]  Zero page views when I had 131,000 apparently the six days before.
[02:37:25.588 --> 02:37:27.089]  And I just couldn't understand why.
[02:37:27.529 --> 02:37:30.472]  And I did it again this morning, and it came up with zero views.
[02:37:30.993 --> 02:37:35.157]  So it really does look like they're trying to keep us out of the top 100, because that's where we've been so successful.
[02:37:35.197 --> 02:37:39.701]  I've been seeing conspiracy of silence in the top 100, which really exposes the Franklin cover-up.
[02:37:40.054 --> 02:37:43.517]  Which is very encouraging, given the recent events of Foley and others.
[02:37:43.637 --> 02:37:46.419]  I almost don't like to mention this, because I think they're stupid.
[02:37:46.459 --> 02:37:47.299]  We know they listen.
[02:37:47.319 --> 02:37:49.001]  I mean, I like Oberman.
[02:37:49.041 --> 02:37:50.382]  It's like he's getting talking points.
[02:37:50.522 --> 02:37:56.186]  You know, Oberman's good, by the way, where he comes out and says, you know, this Foley thing's covering up 6166.
[02:37:56.546 --> 02:37:57.907]  So we know the media listens.
[02:37:57.927 --> 02:37:58.668]  They admit they listen.
[02:37:58.908 --> 02:37:59.789]  I've talked to CNN.
[02:37:59.829 --> 02:38:00.910]  They all listen to this show.
[02:38:01.690 --> 02:38:03.952]  But I hate to almost mention the Franklin cover-up video.
[02:38:03.972 --> 02:38:05.493]  They'll probably have that out of there next week.
[02:38:06.614 --> 02:38:09.496]  It's very upsetting, but yeah, that's possible to happen.
[02:38:10.001 --> 02:38:10.542]  We're good to go.
[02:38:33.191 --> 02:38:36.052]  Yeah, they're going to stage it again because you can't just steal the machines.
[02:38:36.352 --> 02:38:38.012]  You've got to have a ringer who takes a dive.
[02:38:38.632 --> 02:38:42.974]  Again, I hope you guys get the report we put out and spread it to the Four Winds listeners.
[02:38:43.314 --> 02:38:45.774]  That goes for the Loose Change crew as well.
[02:38:46.034 --> 02:38:52.516]  It's frustrating to make something, to put it out for free, and to just want to be on a level playing field and have those cheats.
[02:38:53.156 --> 02:38:55.457]  And of course, I don't know if you've seen their press release, Jason.
[02:38:55.657 --> 02:39:02.118]  They admit they accidentally delete our viewers, but it's an accident, Jason.
[02:39:02.378 --> 02:39:03.818]  Yeah, well, I've had the same thing happen to me.
[02:39:03.898 --> 02:39:05.319]  You know, Loose Change has been erased before.
[02:39:05.339 --> 02:39:07.899]  I had something like 2 million hits on the thing.
[02:39:08.419 --> 02:39:09.599]  I check it the next week, it's down to 100,000.
[02:39:09.739 --> 02:39:11.480]  I'm thinking, how can this happen?
[02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:14.260]  But, you know, you know what kind of business we're in, Alex.
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:15.981]  And you know they're going to keep opposing us.
[02:39:16.321 --> 02:39:18.421]  And it's unfortunate, because Google just bought up YouTube.
[02:39:18.821 --> 02:39:21.522]  You know, YouTube is going to start getting censored more, and we have to be aware of that.
[02:39:21.922 --> 02:39:22.422]  So, again...
[02:39:22.921 --> 02:39:26.403]  Like you said, if they cut off one of our heads, we have to have 50 other people out there.
[02:39:26.683 --> 02:39:38.550]  And I think that's why you and your crew are so successful, because people like Aaron Dykes are getting out there, Kevin Smith are getting out there, and they're confronting monsters like Crystal and Keen, and it's just becoming so successful because of the viral Internet nature of it.
[02:39:39.911 --> 02:39:42.212]  Just a program note, it's not extension 51 to buy them in mass.
[02:39:42.252 --> 02:39:42.332]  It's 54, 54, 54.
[02:39:42.432 --> 02:39:43.472]  Whose extension is 51, Mike?
[02:39:49.102 --> 02:39:49.882]  Video production.
[02:39:49.922 --> 02:39:50.443]  It doesn't matter.
[02:39:50.463 --> 02:39:51.163]  Call whatever you want.
[02:39:51.183 --> 02:39:51.924]  We're going to check them all.
[02:39:52.224 --> 02:39:59.988]  I'll call and counter Google and the rest of them by buying a bunch of loose change second edition and a bunch of Terror Storm DVDs from us today.
[02:40:00.268 --> 02:40:04.050]  But I tell you, folks, I was hoping it was an accident.
[02:40:04.210 --> 02:40:06.211]  They're not doing it to other videos.
[02:40:06.451 --> 02:40:09.673]  They're not doing it to, you know, it's happening to our videos.
[02:40:09.933 --> 02:40:10.514]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:40:10.554 --> 02:40:11.054]  And they'll continue to.
[02:40:11.074 --> 02:40:13.697]  And they've got trolls on the comment board to, you know, bash us and say that we're...
[02:40:31.579 --> 02:40:35.464]  Wacky conspiracy theories when anybody can take... By the way, you know how they're staged?
[02:40:35.944 --> 02:40:46.937]  I can go to 20-something versions of Terror Storm, and it's the same trolls posting in the same order at the exact same time, showing it's automated, and then our regular people are there with diverse posts.
[02:40:47.217 --> 02:40:48.559]  So yeah, they're trolling everywhere.
[02:40:48.719 --> 02:40:50.161]  And it still has four and a half stars.
[02:40:51.082 --> 02:40:57.408]  They also pose as Muslims going, yes, these infidels work for us, letting you think it's your government.
[02:40:57.588 --> 02:40:59.309]  We can't wait to slit your women's throats.
[02:40:59.349 --> 02:41:00.210]  Hail Allah.
[02:41:01.311 --> 02:41:03.033]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:03.894]  I totally agree.
[02:41:03.954 --> 02:41:06.716]  And they are scared of Terror Storm because it has such a broad spectrum.
[02:41:07.037 --> 02:41:13.623]  And really, that first 35, 45 minutes hits you so hard, you almost want to hit stop on the DVD player and start it again.
[02:41:14.025 --> 02:41:16.806]  Because it's that rapid fire and it's that documented.
[02:41:17.126 --> 02:41:19.968]  And that's what they're really afraid of because it's not just our government.
[02:41:20.228 --> 02:41:21.989]  That's just such a small spectrum.
[02:41:22.069 --> 02:41:25.350]  It's governments throughout history, you know, staging these type of events.
[02:41:25.390 --> 02:41:27.831]  We just happen to be top dog militarily right now.
[02:41:28.191 --> 02:41:31.493]  You know, it's happening in Europe and you go over that so well in your movie.
[02:41:32.049 --> 02:41:33.151]  You've been saying that for years.
[02:41:47.646 --> 02:41:48.227]  We're good to go.
[02:42:04.746 --> 02:42:07.427]  People have this hero image that they've got to do it all themselves.
[02:42:07.707 --> 02:42:08.728]  They've got to be perfect.
[02:42:08.768 --> 02:42:12.870]  They've got to Schwarzenegger and defeat the running man all by themselves.
[02:42:12.930 --> 02:42:13.130]  No.
[02:42:13.450 --> 02:42:16.771]  It's all of us together, with initiative, taking action.
[02:42:17.351 --> 02:42:20.873]  We're going to wake this country up, and we're at least going to give the New World Order a run for their money.
[02:42:21.213 --> 02:42:21.793]  So listen.
[02:42:22.714 --> 02:42:24.114]  Don't let them get away with it.
[02:42:24.935 --> 02:42:25.435]  Right now.
[02:42:26.115 --> 02:42:28.216]  People know I've been hammering this the last two weeks because I'm mad.
[02:42:28.857 --> 02:42:29.417]  What about you, Jason?
[02:42:29.457 --> 02:42:30.098]  Absolutely, and you know,
[02:42:58.763 --> 02:43:08.109]  Every single one of your listeners can go into their email box right now, and I guarantee they have at least 10 to 20 people that they know that they talk to on a regular basis that have not seen this movie, that are not aware of it.
[02:43:08.169 --> 02:43:12.151]  All they have to do is put a link down on it and say, hey, give it 10 minutes of a watch.
[02:43:12.711 --> 02:43:14.372]  If they find it compelling, keep watching it.
[02:43:14.812 --> 02:43:17.174]  And people are going to keep watching it because it has that type of effect.
[02:43:17.214 --> 02:43:19.735]  People get sucked into this information because they're aware now.
[02:43:20.196 --> 02:43:23.338]  Hey, if they're deleting everything, Jason, what do you think the real numbers are?
[02:43:23.358 --> 02:43:24.678]  Oh, man.
[02:43:24.998 --> 02:43:25.599]  Well, you know what?
[02:43:26.089 --> 02:43:31.151]  You know, Google Video and YouTube are still such a small, you know, niche of the piracy networks out there.
[02:43:31.191 --> 02:43:33.672]  There's Kazaa, Morpheus, BitTorrent.
[02:43:33.792 --> 02:43:34.432]  Exactly.
[02:43:34.532 --> 02:43:37.174]  I want everyone to go insane on those networks.
[02:43:37.494 --> 02:43:38.534]  Put it on your own machine.
[02:43:38.594 --> 02:43:39.735]  Serve it out on your own site.
[02:43:39.775 --> 02:43:40.415]  Go nuts!
[02:43:40.755 --> 02:43:41.255]  That's right.
[02:43:41.275 --> 02:43:45.477]  And, you know, that's what's so great about this Internet and why we have to fight Internet, too.
[02:43:45.973 --> 02:43:54.018]  Because we need more and more people distributing this information guerrilla style, because there's going to come a point in time when the radio shows aren't going to have us on anymore.
[02:43:54.498 --> 02:43:57.900]  It's pretty surprising to me how much press we have been getting recently, but it's died out a little bit.
[02:43:58.581 --> 02:44:00.362]  Well, you got attacked by the Rolling Stone.
[02:44:00.382 --> 02:44:02.663]  Yeah, well, I've been in contact with him.
[02:44:02.723 --> 02:44:04.044]  I can't wait to release those emails.
[02:44:04.084 --> 02:44:05.965]  If he chickens out on the debate, he's promising me.
[02:44:06.385 --> 02:44:07.266]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:44:07.286 --> 02:44:08.627]  But I'll face any of these guys.
[02:44:08.667 --> 02:44:12.189]  If they want to come up with their garbage, one of his questions to me via email...
[02:44:12.954 --> 02:44:16.437]  What did the Bush administration have to do with the controlled demolitions of the World Trade Center?
[02:44:17.017 --> 02:44:23.903]  And I state to him, you know, we never say the Bush administration had anything to do with it, just the fact that the controlled demolitions happened in every government report.
[02:44:24.063 --> 02:44:35.732]  And they covered it up, and they stripped the game, and the CIA, and everybody else was based in the building, and Marvin Bush's company was running security, and they ordered NORAD to stand down.
[02:44:36.152 --> 02:44:37.053]  But this is how they nitpick.
[02:44:37.293 --> 02:44:38.374]  Yeah, of course.
[02:44:38.394 --> 02:44:39.355]  Let me tell you how they nitpick.
[02:44:39.395 --> 02:44:43.999]  They go, Alex Jones says in a video that the CIA ran drills.
[02:44:44.299 --> 02:44:54.188]  Yes, the CIA with the Naval Reconnaissance Office, the Department of Pentagon Defense, and with the Defense... They all together did it.
[02:44:54.408 --> 02:44:57.550]  It was the CIA officer that first released it to the AP...
[02:44:58.591 --> 02:44:59.372]  John Fulton!
[02:45:00.112 --> 02:45:11.220]  So like the little shills and the fake liberal shills, you know, the types we're talking about, the fake 9-11 movement, people that claim to be the leaders, they go, look at Alex, he's the CIA!
[02:45:11.521 --> 02:45:15.103]  Well, John Fulton, CIA, said he was there running the drill!
[02:45:15.303 --> 02:45:17.345]  Yeah, and you're absolutely correct, CIA.
[02:45:17.385 --> 02:45:20.527]  See, they build straw men.
[02:45:20.547 --> 02:45:22.008]  They build straw men, folks.
[02:45:22.248 --> 02:45:24.070]  They claim we're wrong when we're not.
[02:45:24.270 --> 02:45:25.551]  And then you don't check it out.
[02:45:26.212 --> 02:45:26.654]  That's right.
[02:45:26.795 --> 02:45:27.457]  And you're right.
[02:45:27.839 --> 02:45:28.923]  NORAD's running those drills.
[02:45:28.983 --> 02:45:30.650]  NEADS is coming out with all those drills.
[02:45:30.670 --> 02:45:32.056]  The FAA is admitting the drills.
[02:45:32.409 --> 02:45:36.172]  I mean, it's all out there, and you've had people out there claiming, oh, there were no drills on the morning of 9-11.
[02:45:36.452 --> 02:45:37.113]  Are you kidding me?
[02:45:37.153 --> 02:45:43.798]  Cynthia McKinney, in a 2005 Defense Department budget hearing, had Rumsfeld and Myers confirm it, and she has the paperwork.
[02:45:44.139 --> 02:45:44.399]  I know.
[02:45:44.479 --> 02:45:46.841]  Jason, we've got to get you up for a full hour in the near future.
[02:45:46.861 --> 02:45:53.326]  We love your work, and say hi to Dylan and Corey for me and all the rest of the auxiliary crew.
[02:45:53.647 --> 02:45:54.187]  God bless you.
[02:45:54.207 --> 02:45:55.028]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:45:55.048 --> 02:45:55.548]  All right.
[02:45:55.568 --> 02:45:56.129]  Later on, Alex.
[02:45:56.149 --> 02:45:56.609]  Thanks for having me.
[02:45:56.769 --> 02:45:57.430]  God bless you.
[02:45:57.450 --> 02:45:58.070]  All right.
[02:45:58.110 --> 02:45:59.211]  Get Loose Change 2 out there.
[02:45:59.231 --> 02:46:00.152]  Get Terror Storm out there.
[02:46:00.172 --> 02:46:01.213]  And everybody else, help us.
[02:46:01.773 --> 02:46:03.055]  I mean the other hosts, all of you.
[02:46:03.075 --> 02:46:03.995]  Get egos aside.
[02:46:04.256 --> 02:46:04.636]  Help us.
[02:46:04.676 --> 02:46:05.637]  This is the real fight.
[02:46:05.897 --> 02:46:07.339]  This is where we're reaching the most people.
[02:46:07.719 --> 02:46:08.060]  Okay?
[02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:12.063]  I told people it was micro-FMs seven, eight years ago.
[02:46:12.204 --> 02:46:15.066]  Well, I'm telling you now, this is the most successful way.
[02:46:15.227 --> 02:46:19.010]  So I'm challenging you out there, the micro-crowd and the rest of the people.
[02:46:19.291 --> 02:46:20.472]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:46:20.752 --> 02:46:20.972]  Okay?
[02:46:21.032 --> 02:46:23.575]  I'm the one fighting stuff the longest here in Austin, Texas.
[02:46:23.755 --> 02:46:31.321]  And now I've got people telling me what to do, and telling me how to think, and telling me how to operate, and telling me what I should say, and telling me I'm not doing enough.
[02:46:31.582 --> 02:46:32.643]  You're not doing enough.
[02:46:32.903 --> 02:46:38.728]  I demand you get on the ball, all of our M&FM stations, micros, shortwave, everybody.
[02:46:39.248 --> 02:46:41.790]  I want you to help us get Terror Storm out.
[02:46:43.772 --> 02:46:46.074]  If you want some straight shooting, that's it.
[02:46:46.756 --> 02:46:47.116]  All right?
[02:46:47.677 --> 02:46:52.560]  And I don't claim to have all the answers, but I don't need other people telling me they know more than I know.
[02:46:53.041 --> 02:46:53.901]  I'm sick of it.
[02:46:55.462 --> 02:47:02.167]  I want to play part of Sundown on the Union by good old Bob Dylan.
[02:47:02.448 --> 02:47:03.528]  I'm really fired up right now.
[02:47:04.369 --> 02:47:04.989]  Sundown on the Union.
[02:47:05.009 --> 02:47:09.132]  We'll come back and play this clip, as I promised to, of the guy running for Senate.
[02:47:09.152 --> 02:47:09.493]  Here it is.
[02:47:10.293 --> 02:47:11.114]  Go out with Bob Dylan.
[02:47:18.709 --> 02:47:21.291]  Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore.
[02:47:21.431 --> 02:47:25.873]  My flesh, that's from Taiwan.
[02:47:25.894 --> 02:47:29.375]  My paper car's from Malaysia.
[02:47:29.516 --> 02:47:32.998]  My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
[02:47:33.078 --> 02:47:39.461]  You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines.
[02:47:39.821 --> 02:47:42.223]  And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
[02:47:45.367 --> 02:47:46.287]  We're good to go.
[02:48:17.957 --> 02:48:25.324]  Well, this dress is from Hong Kong, and the pearls are from Japan.
[02:48:25.444 --> 02:48:35.193]  And the dog collar's from India, and the flower pot's from Pakistan.
[02:48:35.773 --> 02:48:40.738]  All the furniture is made in Brazil, well, a woman, she's made.
[02:48:48.946 --> 02:48:52.148]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.488 --> 02:48:54.429]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.790 --> 02:49:02.454]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.135 --> 02:49:10.179]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.579 --> 02:49:13.541]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.901 --> 02:49:16.222]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.663 --> 02:49:17.483]  NSA spies.

[02:50:04.708 --> 02:50:08.151]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:50:08.471 --> 02:50:17.813]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:18.073 --> 02:50:21.573]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:51:24.648 --> 02:51:25.328]  We're good to go.
[02:51:50.109 --> 02:51:53.871]  One day in the U.S.A.
[02:51:54.131 --> 02:51:56.752]  Sure was a good idea.
[02:51:56.993 --> 02:52:05.336]  Till we got in the way.
[02:52:05.496 --> 02:52:09.938]  Well, it's just this.
[02:52:10.159 --> 02:52:11.199]  It's from Hong Kong.
[02:52:11.419 --> 02:52:14.561]  And it comes out from Japan.
[02:52:19.531 --> 02:52:21.052]  I apologize.
[02:52:21.392 --> 02:52:23.733]  I don't have time to go to these loaded phones.
[02:52:23.753 --> 02:52:25.514]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:52:25.754 --> 02:52:27.094]  I'll get you on.
[02:52:27.154 --> 02:52:32.037]  We've got Steve Jones coming on later next week.
[02:52:48.757 --> 02:52:49.357]  Sponsors for inviting me.
[02:52:49.377 --> 02:52:49.957]  I don't often get invited.
[02:52:49.977 --> 02:52:50.638]  This was an important debate.
[02:53:14.483 --> 02:53:18.686]  I had planned another closing message, but I feel compelled to say what I'm about to say.
[02:53:18.706 --> 02:53:25.631]  Now I risk sounding like a conspiracy theorist, but it's no longer a theory.
[02:53:26.852 --> 02:53:28.413]  What I'm about to say is fact.
[02:53:29.794 --> 02:53:33.456]  The secret organizations of the world power elite are no longer secret.
[02:53:34.377 --> 02:53:38.540]  They have planned and are now leading us into a one world communist government.
[02:53:40.228 --> 02:53:43.350]  The combining of national governments started with the European Union.
[02:53:43.931 --> 02:53:57.200]  That union started with trade agreements, then a common currency, the Euro, and now a European Parliament that is feverishly passing laws that override the laws of the member nations.
[02:53:58.961 --> 02:54:04.525]  A constitution was drafted but rejected by a few of those nations, but never mind.
[02:54:05.766 --> 02:54:07.087]  They implemented it anyway.
[02:54:08.488 --> 02:54:09.829]  Now it's North America's turn.
[02:54:11.058 --> 02:54:20.726]  Building on the North American Free Trade Agreement, the NAFTA section of the Commerce Department is busy drafting laws and regulations for a North American union.
[02:54:21.947 --> 02:54:24.049]  A union of Canada, America and Mexico.
[02:54:25.029 --> 02:54:32.415]  The President has attended secret meetings and signed at least two agreements under the Security and Prosperity Partnership Program.
[02:54:33.556 --> 02:54:36.879]  Information leaked out about the meetings and now it is all in the open.
[02:54:37.933 --> 02:54:41.516]  No treaty has been signed, so Congress has not become involved.
[02:54:42.276 --> 02:54:46.339]  However, money from our treasury is now being spent for this effort.
[02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:55.325]  We will have a new currency, the Amaro, and a new constitution, modeled on the Soviet Union's constitution.
[02:54:56.186 --> 02:55:01.990]  Our rights will not be inalienable, but they will be granted by government, who can also take them away.
[02:55:03.826 --> 02:55:10.830]  One sign that this is our future is the plans for the superhighways from southern Mexico through America and into Canada.
[02:55:11.730 --> 02:55:13.511]  These plans are not secret any longer.
[02:55:14.732 --> 02:55:21.416]  Huge amounts of property will be taken in the name of free trade, peace, and security.
[02:55:22.916 --> 02:55:27.439]  You will have a national ID card with a radio frequency chip in it.
[02:55:28.826 --> 02:55:32.830]  That's already law in America and will be implemented by May 2000.
[02:55:33.130 --> 02:55:35.452]  This man voted for it.
[02:55:36.693 --> 02:55:38.855]  You will not be able to move about freely.
[02:55:40.076 --> 02:55:43.119]  This is terrorism of the most worst kind.
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:45.781]  Brought on you by our own government.
[02:55:47.062 --> 02:55:53.188]  The strongest, freest nation in the history of mankind will be averaged into world communism.
[02:55:54.889 --> 02:55:55.710]  Is that what you want?
[02:55:56.767 --> 02:55:59.229]  Are we the people still in control of this nation?
[02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:02.151]  We must begin to act like we are.
[02:56:03.492 --> 02:56:03.952]  Stan Jones.
[02:56:04.933 --> 02:56:06.514]  On that, Conrad Burns, three minutes.
[02:56:07.635 --> 02:56:10.938]  Sure glad you got such a rosy outlook on our future for our kids.
[02:56:11.558 --> 02:56:20.004]  So the traitor who voted for all this in Congress looks at the libertarian candidate and laughs at him and just says, so glad you got a thing for our kids' future.
[02:56:21.365 --> 02:56:22.446]  Incredible treason.
[02:56:22.606 --> 02:56:23.347]  God bless you all.
[02:56:26.081 --> 02:56:26.321]  Or call 877-300-7645.
