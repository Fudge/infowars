[00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:06.542]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.202 --> 00:00:08.283]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:10.145]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:11.566]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:13.227]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:17.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:22.194]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:24.316]  Music
[00:00:30.436 --> 00:00:32.118]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:33.839]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.881]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.503]  We're here live, my friends.
[00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:48.874]  Paul Watson joins us on this Thursday, 21st day of September 2006 edition for one of his bi-weekly news blitzes.
[00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:51.676]  He'll be with us coming up in about a half an hour.
[00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:54.099]  Then we're scheduled to have Congressman...
[00:00:54.912 --> 00:01:00.097]  We'll also talk about the legislation he's introduced to bring forward a national draft or conscription.
[00:01:00.517 --> 00:01:04.041]  And then in the third hour, we're scheduled to have two different gentlemen on.
[00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:19.968]  We're good to go.
[00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:20.268]  I think?
[00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.917]  I would like you to have your question or comment or statement ready so we can move to you and move to the next person quickly.
[00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:50.921]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:55.083 --> 00:02:04.228]  They've zoomed in on the spinach after a week of freaking out and hysteria over E. coli, one death and 120-something people sick.
[00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:14.533]  Surprise, surprise, it's being connected to illegal aliens going potty in the fields in Southern California and in the Valley area.
[00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:19.035]  The precious, wonderful, illegal aliens.
[00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:22.277]  The sun wouldn't rise if it wasn't for them.
[00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:23.907]  We're good to go.
[00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:24.127]  I think?
[00:02:46.892 --> 00:02:48.914]  Hugo Chavez slams U.S.
[00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:57.260]  protection of CIA plane bomber Posada United Nations and goes back into allusions to 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.521]  I want to read some of his quotes.
[00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:03.125]  Great report Paul Watson's put out on this up at prisonplanet.com.
[00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:11.472]  Also, we cover the CIA bombing of the Cuban passenger plane
[00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:19.539]  To be blamed on their own government in my film, Terror Storm, my new documentary.
[00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.880]  The little-known U.S.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.824]  government terror attack that Chavez just talked about yesterday at the United Nations is covered in Terror Storm.
[00:03:30.284 --> 00:03:40.870]  It isn't just Jerome Corsi or Alex Jones or the occasional comment or statement about the North American Union from Lou Dobbs.
[00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.075]  Big report here.
[00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:45.316]  This is out of the Toronto Star.
[00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:49.337]  Getting closer to Uncle Sam.
[00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:58.040]  And they go on to say that public and business leaders kept in the dark about North American integration.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:10.383]  It talks about a secret meeting with our leaders in Canada just last week about the North American Union and how they're being very secretive.
[00:04:11.638 --> 00:04:16.819]  Because half the public doesn't know they're headed from a hole in the ground and doesn't know we're going into a North American Union.
[00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.700]  And the other half is starting to learn of it and is hopping mad so the government does what it always does.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.780]  It just keeps it secret.
[00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:33.162]  The end of our countries and no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, no private property, no nothing under this system.
[00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:34.162]  And then another story here.
[00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:36.002]  Bajram, of course, you roll that daily.
[00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:39.543]  North American confab undermines democracy.
[00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.112]  Attendee of high-level meetings says officials wanted to hide it from the public.
[00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:45.754]  This is today.
[00:04:45.774 --> 00:04:51.337]  Of course, he basically just is reporting on what the Toronto Star broke yesterday.
[00:04:52.478 --> 00:04:54.099]  So we'll cover both these as well.
[00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:55.620]  A lot of other news.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.081]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:07.936]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.276 --> 00:05:10.217]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.578 --> 00:05:18.242]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.923 --> 00:05:25.967]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.269]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.030]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:33.251]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.121]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:04.759]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.862]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:11.544]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:13.926]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.126 --> 00:06:22.573]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:23.954]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:06:24.094 --> 00:06:28.097]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.097 --> 00:06:31.179]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:53.455]  Get the Advanced Berkey Life Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:53.515 --> 00:06:54.656]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:07:58.667 --> 00:08:04.590]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.954 --> 00:08:28.275]  We're good to go.
[00:09:05.092 --> 00:09:06.192]  Yeah, you there, bro?
[00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:32.481]  We're good to go.
[00:10:09.973 --> 00:10:12.235]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:20.561]  I am so busy news gathering during the breaks and being besieged from all directions that occasionally I forget these are three minute breaks.
[00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:21.862]  So we are back.
[00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:27.906]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:38.273]  Thrust into my little hand, and I have been aware of this since Monday, is the official court ruling that
[00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:58.402]  By the federal government that they are declaring total ownership and control over all waterways, all coastal waterways, all rivers and streams, and that no boats of any type are allowed on any of them at any time.
[00:10:59.923 --> 00:11:01.003]  This is not a joke.
[00:11:01.063 --> 00:11:03.364]  I have the ruling here in front of me.
[00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:07.986]  So we'll be getting into that a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:11:09.213 --> 00:11:18.099]  America Blog did point out today, what I had pointed out yesterday, that Bush bashes Syria at United Nations...
[00:11:19.492 --> 00:11:20.073]  We're good to go.
[00:11:20.093 --> 00:11:20.253]  I think?
[00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:58.484]  Criticized several countries by name, demanding that Iran abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions and telling Syrians that their government has allowed their country to become a crossroads for terrorism and a tool of Iran.
[00:11:58.965 --> 00:12:00.665]  His audacity is amazing.
[00:12:00.965 --> 00:12:04.447]  No, he just knows the general public is not very well informed.
[00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.494]  He rallied against Syria at the U.N.
[00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:11.717]  the same day after we learned the U.S.
[00:12:11.737 --> 00:12:16.500]  conspired with Canada to send an innocent man to Syria to be tortured.
[00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:26.048]  Canadian intelligence officials passed false warnings and bad information to American agents about Muslim Canadian citizen after which U.S.
[00:12:26.088 --> 00:12:29.631]  authorities secretly whisked him to Syria where he was tortured.
[00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:33.634]  A judicial report and review in Canada concluded on Monday.
[00:12:37.185 --> 00:12:37.825]  Exactly.
[00:12:38.946 --> 00:12:49.871]  We have innocent people taken to Syria by our government, by the Canadian government, by the British government, by the German government, by the French government for that matter, to be tortured.
[00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:56.854]  Now, how is Syria not working with the hijackers of our government?
[00:12:56.914 --> 00:12:59.715]  I don't want to say not working with us, because this isn't our government.
[00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:00.776]  They are.
[00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:02.857]  They have totally rolled over.
[00:13:03.957 --> 00:13:05.878]  And this is just more evidence of that.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:14.282]  So Bush is criticizing Syria out of one side of his mouth and out of the other side, sending people there to be tortured.
[00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:16.682]  I mentioned this yesterday.
[00:13:16.782 --> 00:13:23.824]  I'm just going to get into it now because I wanted to cover it and I never did, and I saw it at the top of the stack when I got in today to the office.
[00:13:25.224 --> 00:13:26.864]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:13:30.285 --> 00:13:33.966]  Gore says tax pollution, not payrolls.
[00:13:35.618 --> 00:13:36.599]  Former U.S.
[00:13:36.739 --> 00:13:49.988]  Vice President Al Gore on Monday suggested taxing carbon dioxide emissions instead of employees' pay in a bid to stem global warming.
[00:13:50.891 --> 00:14:00.601]  Penalizing pollution instead of penalizing employment will work to reduce that pollution, Gore said in a speech at New York University School of Law.
[00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:08.229]  The pollution tax would replace all payroll taxes, including those for Social Security and unemployment compensation, Gore said.
[00:14:08.249 --> 00:14:11.413]  He said the overall level of taxation would remain the same.
[00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:20.623]  Instead of discouraging businesses from hiring more employees, it would discourage businesses from producing more pollution, Gore said.
[00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:23.645]  Okay, let me just stop right there.
[00:14:26.626 --> 00:14:37.232]  Whether you believe in global warming or not, whether you believe what Al Gore is saying or not, the solution...
[00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:59.617]  That has been put forward by Al Gore and the IMF and the World Bank and the European Union is a global set of taxes against all forms of industry and then money transfers, private property, everything.
[00:15:00.917 --> 00:15:02.858]  This is the global tax.
[00:15:02.918 --> 00:15:04.399]  The oil wellhead tax.
[00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:06.120]  The emissions tax.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.801]  The Kyoto Protocol.
[00:15:10.942 --> 00:15:14.264]  It has nothing to do with global warming.
[00:15:14.324 --> 00:15:15.785]  It is a global tax.
[00:15:15.885 --> 00:15:21.528]  It will not reduce the use of fuels.
[00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:25.351]  It will simply pass on costs to the people.
[00:15:27.452 --> 00:15:32.275]  So even if you believe the fraud of global warming,
[00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:42.304]  There is no debating that this, quote, solution has nothing to do with your religious tenet.
[00:15:44.885 --> 00:15:51.307]  It is nothing more but another way to fund world government, period.
[00:15:51.407 --> 00:15:59.610]  And if you think they're going to get rid of the income tax, and they're going to get rid of all these other taxes when they institute their energy tax, give me a break.
[00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.492]  They always say that when they're pushing a tax, and once it goes into place...
[00:16:05.342 --> 00:16:10.424]  Occasionally at first they'll lower existing taxes, and then a year or two later jack them back up.
[00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:12.325]  But they never get rid of them.
[00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:18.527]  And on the other side of the equation, we've got phony neocons on talk radio pushing the fair tax.
[00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:20.467]  Oh, it'll be so fair.
[00:16:20.487 --> 00:16:23.228]  23% national sales tax.
[00:16:25.149 --> 00:16:27.630]  Graduated where the poor won't even have to pay it.
[00:16:29.409 --> 00:16:31.710]  And they say, oh, we'll get rid of the income tax.
[00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:34.072]  They're not going to get rid of the income tax.
[00:16:34.392 --> 00:16:48.220]  They're going to keep it and simply change the name of it to the Social Security tax and cut down the current rate and then jack up both of the new national sales tax along with the existing income tax.
[00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:57.086]  And yeah, they're going to have, via the transponders in all your cars, the international money transfer tax.
[00:17:00.726 --> 00:17:01.686]  The Tobin tax.
[00:17:01.986 --> 00:17:06.127]  They're going to have the energy tax via the transponders.
[00:17:06.948 --> 00:17:11.949]  Transponders in your credit cards, transponders in your driver's license, transponders in your inspection sticker.
[00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:19.171]  Folks, it is in the official NAFTA and CAFTA and North American Union documents.
[00:17:21.872 --> 00:17:26.333]  It is there for the entire world to see.
[00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:34.520]  We're good to go.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:34.881]  I think?
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:02.986]  And it's different arms, our private, our run-for-profit, IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, World Trade Organization, World Health Organization.
[00:18:04.627 --> 00:18:08.850]  There is no liberty, there is no freedom, there is no Bill of Rights, there is no Constitution.
[00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:14.074]  Read Article 30 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:18:14.174 --> 00:18:19.158]  It says you have no rights in plain black and white.
[00:18:20.245 --> 00:18:21.746]  That the state is all powerful.
[00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:24.467]  It is a declaration of dictatorship.
[00:18:27.508 --> 00:18:28.929]  It's classic contract fraud.
[00:18:28.969 --> 00:18:33.050]  The first 29 articles are how you have this wonderful liberty and that wonderful right.
[00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:39.273]  And then you get to article 30 and it says you have absolutely no rights whenever we feel like it and whenever we say it.
[00:18:42.174 --> 00:18:46.016]  And you can't own guns and you can't own private property and you're an absolute slave.
[00:18:46.056 --> 00:18:47.036]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:18:50.313 --> 00:18:52.797]  And I know a lot of you are squealing and screaming.
[00:18:52.817 --> 00:18:53.778]  I've read the blogs.
[00:18:53.838 --> 00:18:54.639]  I've gotten your emails.
[00:18:54.679 --> 00:18:57.663]  How dare you, you ignorant fool, say there's no global warming?
[00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:02.991]  Oh, there's global climate change, and it is constant.
[00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:06.370]  And it is quite violent right now, and you bet.
[00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.111]  Large areas of the world are heating up and other areas are cooling down.
[00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:12.891]  And I've got all the big climatology reports here.
[00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:13.971]  I actually read these.
[00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:22.613]  I don't just go see Al Gore's movie and then go get in a fetal position in the bathroom and roll around on the ground, you know, wetting myself.
[00:19:23.314 --> 00:19:25.694]  Going, global government, oh, please come save me.
[00:19:26.174 --> 00:19:28.135]  What is your global tax going to do?
[00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:29.015]  Oh, by the way...
[00:19:30.876 --> 00:19:34.418]  It's a selectively enforced global tax against the Western world.
[00:19:35.638 --> 00:19:46.684]  The United States, England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, China, India, and 166 other countries have to make zero emissions, reductions, or cuts.
[00:19:47.004 --> 00:19:52.246]  So if you think the deindustrialization of this country is bad now, you think it's hard to get an industry job now.
[00:19:52.906 --> 00:19:53.487]  Ha ha!
[00:19:54.307 --> 00:19:56.388]  The fun hasn't even begun.
[00:19:56.688 --> 00:19:57.248]  I want to get to this...
[00:19:59.056 --> 00:20:00.276]  Well, just stay with us.
[00:20:00.316 --> 00:20:01.057]  Important news coming up.
[00:20:01.957 --> 00:20:04.838]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:05.198 --> 00:20:08.079]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:14.481]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:22.183]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:20:22.363 --> 00:20:26.464]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.360]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.222]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.402 --> 00:21:15.206]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:20.828]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:28.011]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.411 --> 00:21:29.212]  We're good to go.
[00:21:29.252 --> 00:21:29.872]  We're good to go.
[00:21:46.921 --> 00:21:53.166]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.487 --> 00:21:57.009]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.910]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:03.815]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:10.180]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:10.961]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:16.031]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:19.694]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:20.675 --> 00:22:25.959]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:35.027]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:04.238 --> 00:23:06.179]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.061]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:18.294]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:19.254 --> 00:23:24.156]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.
[00:23:24.796 --> 00:23:34.781]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:23:35.261 --> 00:23:37.522]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:23:38.348 --> 00:23:39.528]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:39.548 --> 00:23:39.588]  702-953-0267.

[00:23:41.129 --> 00:23:42.049]  That's www.lazemedinc.com.
[00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:27.526]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[00:24:27.546 --> 00:24:30.188]  Paula Watson joining us in the next segment.
[00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:36.691]  Colorado State Professor disputes global warming is human-caused.
[00:24:37.732 --> 00:24:41.274]  See, this is reasonable, and this is what the science matches.
[00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:48.177]  The Daily Reporter-Herald, global warming is happening, but humans are not the cause.
[00:24:48.317 --> 00:24:53.060]  You see, I would just change that to radical climate change is happening.
[00:24:54.346 --> 00:24:55.747]  But humans are not the cause.
[00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:59.769]  One of the nation's top experts on hurricanes said Monday.
[00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:11.897]  Bill Gray, we're trying to get on, who has studied tropical meteorology for more than 40 years, spoke at the Laramere County Republican Club breakfast about global warming and whether humans are to blame.
[00:25:11.937 --> 00:25:13.438]  About 50 people were at the talk.
[00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:24.250]  Gray, who was a professor at Colorado State University, said human-induced global warming is a fear perpetrated by the media and scientists who are trying to get federal grants, and that is part of it.
[00:25:25.511 --> 00:25:36.461]  I think we are coming out of the little ice age, and warming is due to changes to ocean circulation patterns due to salinity variations, Gray said.
[00:25:36.581 --> 00:25:37.422]  I'm sure that's it.
[00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.470]  We're good to go.
[00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:38.830]  We're good to go.
[00:26:08.766 --> 00:26:26.391]  They're saying we're having very serious climate change, and that human activity is negligible in the overall, compared to other inputs, such as volcanoes, such as natural forest fires and things of that nature.
[00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:35.053]  But then even those inputs, or global climate changing engines,
[00:26:35.822 --> 00:26:51.329]  Pale in significance themselves to that gigantic ball of burning gas at the center of our solar system that we orbit here happily, my friends, that's the real problem.
[00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:58.893]  And if you will simply type into Google, sun brighter, or sun entering brightest cycle,
[00:27:00.111 --> 00:27:04.314]  The scientists thought the last 11 and a half year cycle was the greatest ever recorded.
[00:27:04.874 --> 00:27:10.397]  Now they're saying that the new cycle is already online to dwarf that cycle.
[00:27:11.317 --> 00:27:12.498]  And then hold on to your hat.
[00:27:12.518 --> 00:27:15.340]  I know I've talked about this quite a bit, but it's pretty darn important.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:24.064]  The new sun cycle may be 50% brighter than the previous cycle.
[00:27:24.184 --> 00:27:27.266]  And if it is, it's definitely online to be much brighter than the last one.
[00:27:28.675 --> 00:27:42.870]  And they're saying if it continues to heat up and increase its burn rate, that is the nuclear reactions going on in its furnace, that it may be 50% brighter by the time the cycle peaks about seven years from now.
[00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:47.795]  And folks, if that happens, Lord knows what's going to develop.
[00:27:48.622 --> 00:27:49.623]  NASA doesn't know.
[00:27:49.643 --> 00:27:50.563]  No one knows.
[00:27:51.064 --> 00:27:52.365]  But you better believe this.
[00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:57.688]  It is, in the short term, going to accelerate global warming.
[00:27:58.089 --> 00:28:05.914]  And then global warming itself, if it's too quick, then it triggers a massive cooling that has to do with precipitation and then
[00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:16.137]  They get these flash freezes in the north and then suddenly polar ice caps get much larger almost overnight in the scheme of time.
[00:28:16.177 --> 00:28:18.899]  It gets off into all these other calculations.
[00:28:19.399 --> 00:28:24.362]  The point is, no global tax is going to save us from the sun heating up.
[00:28:25.114 --> 00:28:27.196]  No global tax is going to save us.
[00:28:28.316 --> 00:28:42.386]  I mean, again, even if our cars were doing this, what does a global tax selectively put on the Western world, on our industries and on our transportation, what is that going to do to stop the end of the world?
[00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:46.349]  Oh my gosh, save me Al Gore, let me sit in your lap, oh please.
[00:28:48.711 --> 00:28:50.873]  It's an emotional salve.
[00:28:51.633 --> 00:28:54.215]  It is nothing but a crisis to bring in world governments.
[00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:56.810]  What happened 20 years ago?
[00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.551]  The patents for DuPont and Dow Chemical ran out on Freon.
[00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:03.892]  They openly went and lobbied the UN.
[00:29:03.932 --> 00:29:05.832]  They went and openly lobbied the federal government.
[00:29:05.872 --> 00:29:23.316]  They put out junk science that CFCs were eating the ozone layer and the earth was going to die and we were all going to be dead if we didn't switch over to these new patented chemicals that they had in this new refrigeration and air conditioning system and they forced the entire globe over to it.
[00:29:24.702 --> 00:29:25.422]  And here we are.
[00:29:27.863 --> 00:29:39.445]  But then on the other hand, they tell you our cars create too much ozone, our engines do, and so there's Ozone Action Day, oh, there's deadly ozone everywhere, but it's dying in the atmosphere, CFCs, ah!
[00:29:40.806 --> 00:29:42.206]  It's just another scam.
[00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:45.326]  So good, if it feels good, look, be scammed.
[00:29:45.466 --> 00:29:46.127]  Don't listen to me.
[00:29:46.807 --> 00:29:47.607]  Enjoy yourselves.
[00:29:51.937 --> 00:29:52.877]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.337 --> 00:29:54.938]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:58.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:04.840]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.320]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:14.422]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:30:15.042 --> 00:30:17.322]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:21.463]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.202]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:30:26.782 --> 00:30:29.763]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:30:30.743 --> 00:30:33.644]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:30:34.385 --> 00:30:37.006]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:37.146 --> 00:30:37.626]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:37.686 --> 00:30:40.427]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:42.728]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:30:52.262 --> 00:31:00.113]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[00:31:01.454 --> 00:31:06.418]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:31:06.718 --> 00:31:12.163]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:16.486]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:31:16.846 --> 00:31:19.849]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:23.592]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:31:23.912 --> 00:31:33.278]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:37.040]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:44.384]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:31:44.644 --> 00:31:46.005]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[00:31:46.065 --> 00:31:47.786]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:50.828 --> 00:31:54.910]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.511]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:31:57.671 --> 00:32:00.712]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.242 --> 00:32:15.485]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:15.505 --> 00:32:20.970]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:30.639]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:32.120]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:37.545]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:32:38.044 --> 00:32:42.528]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:42.548 --> 00:32:43.909]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.089 --> 00:32:47.913]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:47.973 --> 00:32:48.853]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:37.904]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:38.865 --> 00:33:40.966]  I'm so glad that you decided to tune in here.
[00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:46.669]  Each day we do the best job we can to warn you about the scams, the frauds, the criminal activities in the New World Order.
[00:33:47.387 --> 00:33:50.349]  David, Brett, Dino, James, Ron, everybody, we'll get to your calls.
[00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:57.214]  We do have Congressman Rangel lined up, always colorful, always engaging, always informative in the next hour.
[00:33:57.514 --> 00:34:04.639]  And then we've got former special secret agents coming on who have been intimately involved in government-state-sponsored terrorism.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.542]  Oh yes, as we continue to expose the New World Order's criminal activities.
[00:34:10.183 --> 00:34:15.867]  But right now we are joined by Paul Joseph Watson, who joins us from the United Kingdom.
[00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:22.563]  To run through some of the news that he's been covering and documenting and breaking down for us.
[00:34:22.663 --> 00:34:24.165]  Chronicling, I guess, is the best term.
[00:34:24.465 --> 00:34:25.946]  Paul, good to have you on with us, my friend.
[00:34:26.346 --> 00:34:27.287]  Good to be back, Alex.
[00:34:27.807 --> 00:34:28.288]  You bet.
[00:34:29.209 --> 00:34:30.009]  Paul, what do you think?
[00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:34.573]  Kind of lay out some of the issues you're about to cover and then tell us which one you want to get into first.
[00:34:35.694 --> 00:34:37.915]  Well, you were just talking about global warming.
[00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.678]  You can go to space.com.
[00:34:41.758 --> 00:34:43.500]  You can go to newscientist.com.
[00:34:44.255 --> 00:34:46.956]  And read about global warming on Pluto.
[00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:50.258]  Read about global warming on Jupiter.
[00:34:50.818 --> 00:34:53.679]  I don't see many SUVs on Pluto or Jupiter.
[00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:55.560]  No, it's just the SUV's fault.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.161]  We need a global UN tax and that will fix it.
[00:34:59.622 --> 00:35:01.943]  It's all, you know, perception is reality.
[00:35:01.983 --> 00:35:05.004]  The British media, the British people are sold on it, basically.
[00:35:05.644 --> 00:35:09.706]  And every summer when it gets hot in July, because it's summer...
[00:35:10.692 --> 00:35:15.277]  The BBC report, oh, it's so hot today, it's so hot today, every single day.
[00:35:15.797 --> 00:35:20.942]  And then this year it got to August and it was cold and wet throughout the entire month of August.
[00:35:21.183 --> 00:35:23.845]  Were there any news reports on the fact that it was cold and wet?
[00:35:24.166 --> 00:35:24.946]  None whatsoever.
[00:35:25.447 --> 00:35:27.289]  It's all in how the media report it.
[00:35:28.533 --> 00:35:45.377]  Well, that's right, and globally the temperature is up about 2 degrees from what it was in the last 50 years on average, but that is part of, there is no normal cycle, just part of the ongoing cycle of the climate gyrating.
[00:35:47.237 --> 00:35:47.777]  That's right.
[00:35:48.737 --> 00:35:50.958]  The other subjects I wanted to get into are obviously...
[00:35:51.758 --> 00:36:00.180]  Hugo Chavez's speech at the UN yesterday and the details within it that the media deliberately ignored, basically.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:05.902]  And then a little something about the prediction you made.
[00:36:05.942 --> 00:36:14.024]  We've got Karl Rove coming out and saying that a promise, not a prediction from him, but a promise that there will be
[00:36:14.659 --> 00:36:20.080]  Be an October surprise that will win the Republicans both houses in November.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.620]  Have you done a report on this yet?
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.661]  This is new news to me.
[00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:28.202]  It's just broke in the last couple of hours, so I've got a report coming out on it later today.
[00:36:29.042 --> 00:36:31.282]  All right, well, let's run through both of those right now.
[00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:33.403]  Let's get into Chavez first.
[00:36:35.263 --> 00:36:38.664]  Well, yeah, Chavez got up to make his speech to the UN yesterday.
[00:36:39.044 --> 00:36:43.065]  Obviously, he made the kind of jokey offhand comment
[00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:50.916]  Characterizing Bush as the devil within minutes before he'd even finished his speech.
[00:36:52.037 --> 00:36:53.138]  Fox News alert!
[00:36:54.719 --> 00:36:59.863]  Hugo Chavez calls Bush the devil before he'd even finished his speech.
[00:37:00.283 --> 00:37:02.525]  And that was what all the headlines were about after it.
[00:37:02.565 --> 00:37:04.086]  It's classic bait and switch.
[00:37:05.007 --> 00:37:10.872]  When, if you read the entirety of what Chavez said, which we've posted on prisonplanet.com today...
[00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:25.459]  He discusses CIA control of terrorists, specifically the case of Luis Posada Carriles, the anti-Cuban terrorist and plane bomber who was on the payroll of the CIA from the 60s until 1976.
[00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:30.443]  And being protected today in this country.
[00:37:31.563 --> 00:37:32.264]  Well, that's right.
[00:37:32.284 --> 00:37:37.007]  He originally started out, as I've detailed in that article I put out today...
[00:37:37.637 --> 00:38:00.395]  As the leader, with another CIA operative, Orlando Bosch, of the Commanders of United Revolutionary Organizations Group, which was a terrorist cell, they carried out over 50 bombings and political assassinations, including that October 1976 bombing of the Cuban passenger airliner as it took off from Barbados.
[00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:07.229]  All under the supervision of the then-director of the CIA, George H.W.
[00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:09.471]  Bush, President Bush's father.
[00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:10.411]  Ah!
[00:38:11.492 --> 00:38:12.593]  Interesting connection.
[00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:21.579]  They were arrested and jailed in Venezuela, but escaped in 1985 after they bribed the prison guards.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:30.585]  They were then transported by another Cuban expatriate called Felix Rodriguez to El Salvador to link up with
[00:38:31.394 --> 00:38:35.696]  Old Ollie North and become part of the Iran-Contra conspiracy.
[00:38:35.716 --> 00:38:40.278]  So they were engaged in that role for quite some time.
[00:38:40.298 --> 00:38:47.261]  You had senators asking questions on the Senate floor as to why this known terrorist was being allowed to collude with U.S.
[00:38:47.301 --> 00:38:48.541]  government operations.
[00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:59.386]  Afterwards, he was released again into Miami, and then he went on to carry out a wave of tourist industry bombings in Havana during the 1990s.
[00:39:01.477 --> 00:39:22.529]  And then just three days ago, the ruling came through from a Texas magistrate to order the Immigration Bureau to release Posada once again so he can presumably carry on the terrorist mass murdering activities that he's been doing for decades under the jurisdiction of the CIA.
[00:39:22.669 --> 00:39:26.111]  And he's pled guilty to this before he's gotten out of prison and escaped.
[00:39:26.838 --> 00:39:30.182]  And there's no talk of extraditing this convicted terrorist.
[00:39:30.282 --> 00:39:30.683]  Oh, no.
[00:39:31.223 --> 00:39:34.126]  In fact, he'll probably start having fun again right here in Texas.
[00:39:35.768 --> 00:39:47.101]  Well, what's interesting about it is that Rodriguez, who was Posada's handler during the Iran-Contra congressional hearings, actually bragged of meeting with
[00:39:47.737 --> 00:39:48.737]  Yes, the Bush crime family.
[00:40:08.374 --> 00:40:09.255]  So we have that.
[00:40:09.375 --> 00:40:26.747]  We also have his quotes concerning where he says, and the CIA is behind the other terror here in the U.S., and that's basically where he left it concerning 9-11, though early last week he came out and said, hey, buildings don't fall like that without explosives, and it's gaining momentum.
[00:40:27.627 --> 00:40:34.752]  The theory, the hypothesis that this was an inside job is a pretext to launch this global war of domination, to paraphrase.
[00:40:36.226 --> 00:40:37.207]  Yeah.
[00:40:37.407 --> 00:40:39.489]  He gave that speech laying it out full board.
[00:40:39.509 --> 00:40:43.752]  He alluded to it yesterday in saying that Americans who died in the U.S.
[00:40:44.093 --> 00:40:46.935]  were the victims of the CIA terrorists.
[00:40:47.836 --> 00:40:59.005]  Time magazine did a report just last week, which I'm looking at now, and the picture is of a giant billboard in Havana which reads, Coming soon to North American courts.
[00:40:59.086 --> 00:41:01.868]  The assassin with Posada Carrilez.
[00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:03.492]  We're good to go.
[00:41:29.705 --> 00:41:35.669]  At every turn, the Bush family is instrumental in ensuring their safe passage and protection.
[00:41:37.291 --> 00:41:41.754]  It's amazing, and you can break through that news blackout at prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:41:41.794 --> 00:41:43.295]  Paul's done a great job with this report.
[00:41:44.315 --> 00:41:48.939]  Shifting gears now to the second subject, you just brought up Karl Rove.
[00:41:48.979 --> 00:41:57.345]  We have White House memos where they're saying, hey, we need to catch bin Laden or have a huge terror attack before the next election or we're going to lose.
[00:41:58.185 --> 00:41:58.686]  We've got...
[00:42:00.469 --> 00:42:04.070]  Back in the 2004 election, the White House told U.S.
[00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.750]  News & World Report that, quote, D.C.
[00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.411]  would be nuked, and we said to folks, don't believe that.
[00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:16.592]  Since Roe is now saying, again, we will be hit, I will have to downgrade and say it's not guaranteed, because usually these people lie.
[00:42:17.013 --> 00:42:17.873]  They are terrorists.
[00:42:18.673 --> 00:42:23.914]  But, Paul, going back, you said there's been some new development that I am ignorant of.
[00:42:24.514 --> 00:42:25.554]  Please enlighten me.
[00:42:27.035 --> 00:42:28.035]  Yeah, it's one of these...
[00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:29.319]  Yeah.
[00:42:46.616 --> 00:42:51.800]  He didn't give any other details as to what that surprise might be, but he made a promise that it would happen.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.661]  Well, I think we're seeing the surprise.
[00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:58.664]  We've gone from an average of $3.10 a gallon of gas down to an average of about $2.30.
[00:42:59.104 --> 00:43:05.768]  By the way, folks, just three and a half years ago it was $1.35 a gallon, so people now think $1 more a gallon is a great deal.
[00:43:05.828 --> 00:43:07.069]  You're being scammed either way.
[00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.872]  I see it as a good sign that they've pressured the oil companies at lower prices to
[00:43:13.536 --> 00:43:14.896]  At least until the end of the election.
[00:43:14.936 --> 00:43:21.858]  That shows that they're trying more of the classical things to get votes instead of blowing up a city.
[00:43:21.918 --> 00:43:23.859]  But we're not out of the woods yet, Paul.
[00:43:23.899 --> 00:43:24.259]  Go ahead.
[00:43:25.739 --> 00:43:42.043]  Well, obviously before the 2004 election, it was in late October, days before the actual election itself, that we witnessed the release of bin Laden campaigning basically for the re-election of Bush.
[00:43:43.112 --> 00:43:47.219]  And John Kerry controls Cullenbone's asset that he is.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.650]  Even himself later blamed his election defeat on the release of that Bin Laden tape.
[00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.896]  So when Rove talks about another October surprise...
[00:43:57.811 --> 00:44:02.152]  It could obviously be in the realm of the PR propaganda war front.
[00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:14.856]  We've already seen a bunch of new Al-Qaeda tapes, and everybody's starting to notice this, even mainstream media, that Al-Qaeda and bin Laden just seem to work for the Republican Party, because they just always pop up at the exact perfect time.
[00:44:16.476 --> 00:44:20.038]  Well, yeah, and we know for a fact that these tapes are part of a U.S.
[00:44:20.078 --> 00:44:21.538]  propaganda campaign, because...
[00:44:22.219 --> 00:44:48.811]  Before the appearance of Musab al-Zarqawi, who was later pronounced dead for the 24th time by the US government, before his first appearance in a videotape rather than an audio tape, it was a stated Pentagon propaganda campaign to quote, target the US home audience in inflating the role, exaggerating the role of Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq.
[00:44:49.611 --> 00:44:51.012]  And they even went to the
[00:44:51.661 --> 00:44:52.621]  We're good to go.
[00:45:15.968 --> 00:45:17.408]  You're right, Paul.
[00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:23.829]  And I think, well, I don't think I know more and more people are beginning to see through this.
[00:45:43.268 --> 00:45:47.430]  What else do you have on your front burner there news-wise that you think is important?
[00:45:49.431 --> 00:46:09.420]  Just to tie into the protection of Posada and this Cuban terrorist Selvig Chavez was talking about yesterday, the Washington Post recently reported that a guy by the name of Abdallah Tabarek, who was bin Laden's bodyguard, was assassinated.
[00:46:10.009 --> 00:46:10.309]  I don't know.
[00:46:29.713 --> 00:46:32.734]  To, you know, hoodwink the U.S.
[00:46:32.754 --> 00:46:38.917]  military campaign to catch Bin Laden, which they released him and failed to target him over and over again deliberately.
[00:46:38.997 --> 00:46:41.098]  Buzzy Krongard said they weren't interested in him.
[00:46:41.738 --> 00:46:46.540]  So he provided that distraction so Bin Laden could escape in 2001.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.282]  He was arrested by the U.S., taken to Guantanamo Bay.
[00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:53.442]  Nobody was allowed to see him.
[00:46:53.482 --> 00:46:54.843]  The Red Cross tried to see him.
[00:46:55.362 --> 00:47:02.244]  And then after supposedly spending three years there, if he was ever there in the first place, he was released without charge.
[00:47:02.544 --> 00:47:08.986]  And this is the very guy that helped Bin Laden escape in December 2001 at Tora Bora.
[00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:18.128]  So another example of the US government providing safe passage for their high-grade terrorist patsies, just as was the case with Posada.
[00:47:19.149 --> 00:47:20.329]  That was in the Washington Post.
[00:47:21.374 --> 00:47:22.234]  It's amazing.
[00:47:23.215 --> 00:47:39.101]  Paul, from the outside, looking into the U.S., seeing all the videos, reading the analysis and the press reports out of last week's historic demonstrations at Ground Zero on the five-year anniversary, what's your take on what happened?
[00:47:40.902 --> 00:47:45.944]  Well, it proves that the 9-11 truth movement and the general awareness movement
[00:47:46.653 --> 00:47:51.155]  is now insipid within American culture and we are becoming the majority.
[00:47:51.735 --> 00:48:06.540]  There's a good speech by Barry Zwicker on Prison Planet now where he points out that we normally would expect to see such a groundswell of sentiment in the American population, the people that are actually turned on and who can sing, not the dumbbells.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:13.002]  We would expect to see such an obvious groundswell reflected back from the mainstream media.
[00:48:13.607 --> 00:48:24.009]  But because the mainstream media cast a veil over that reflection, over that mirror, we don't see it, which could lead to some people thinking that it doesn't exist.
[00:48:24.149 --> 00:48:33.891]  But simply on the anecdotal evidence where Zwicker talks about, and you've had the same experiences which you've talked about on your show, he's going through airports.
[00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:40.932]  He makes jokes with airport security personnel about, oh, aren't you worried about all this terrorist stuff?
[00:48:40.992 --> 00:48:42.212]  It's pretty frightening, isn't it?
[00:48:42.617 --> 00:48:45.960]  And they just immediately snap back, no, it's all fraud.
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.941]  It's a giant fraud.
[00:48:47.262 --> 00:48:49.664]  He's talking to people in the street who say the same thing.
[00:48:49.684 --> 00:48:54.308]  He's talking to people who he boards the airplane with and they say exactly the same thing.
[00:48:54.388 --> 00:48:55.369]  It's a giant fraud.
[00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:05.039]  But it's not reflected in the mainstream media that now at least half and soon to be the majority of American people see this fraud for what it is.
[00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:07.261]  And the anecdotal evidence suggests that
[00:49:07.802 --> 00:49:08.483]  We're good to go.
[00:49:29.444 --> 00:49:30.084]  Absolutely.
[00:49:30.144 --> 00:49:35.686]  Paul Watson, more great reports from you and your brother Steve Watson throughout today and the weekend.
[00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:40.268]  Keep it up over at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:40.308 --> 00:49:47.390]  We have added a lot of new features to PrisonPlanet.tv, a lot of new material, the entire 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium.
[00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.751]  My speech is now up there.
[00:49:50.706 --> 00:49:51.306]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:50:19.897 --> 00:50:27.845]  In-studio guests, speeches, Alex Jones TV show, the best audio interviews from the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:41.859]  One other thing before you break that's interesting, we've got it up on prisonplanet.com, is Barack Obama's new book where he says that after shaking hands with people, President Bush orders his aides to clean his hands.
[00:50:42.577 --> 00:50:44.799]  So, again, perception is reality.
[00:50:44.819 --> 00:50:51.283]  This scrub, brush-clearing, cowboy hat-wearing individual boss is actually the biggest fraud walking the planet.
[00:50:53.665 --> 00:50:55.626]  Now, now, he's afraid of horses.
[00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:57.247]  That makes him a cowpoke.
[00:50:57.747 --> 00:50:58.568]  Thanks, Paul.
[00:50:58.628 --> 00:50:59.208]  Take care.
[00:50:59.228 --> 00:51:00.790]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:01.270]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:08.131]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.471 --> 00:51:10.411]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.771 --> 00:51:18.433]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.113 --> 00:51:26.154]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.575 --> 00:51:29.495]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[00:51:29.895 --> 00:51:32.396]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.636 --> 00:51:33.456]  NSA spies.
[00:51:34.886 --> 00:51:37.987]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:51:38.287 --> 00:51:41.809]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.269 --> 00:51:44.190]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:48.433]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:34.187 --> 00:53:34.487]  I think?
[00:54:04.486 --> 00:54:10.530]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:14.152]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:23.378 --> 00:54:25.340]  My new film Terror Storm is out.
[00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.562]  It is available on DVD, the two-hour film, plus 66 minutes.

[00:54:43.206 --> 00:54:44.747]  It has an Iraq war section.
[00:54:44.867 --> 00:54:46.088]  It is my crowning achievement.
[00:54:46.668 --> 00:54:47.408]  We're good to go.
[00:54:47.448 --> 00:54:48.108]  We're good to go.
[00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:08.223]  Hi, good morning, Alex.
[00:55:30.054 --> 00:55:31.457]  Two things on my mind this morning.
[00:55:31.658 --> 00:55:34.104]  One, you're absolutely right about the global warming.
[00:55:34.184 --> 00:55:38.936]  I recall a story about Dow Chemical Company putting out a bunch of propaganda about
[00:55:39.591 --> 00:55:43.354]  The ozone layer and hydrocarbons and so forth.
[00:55:43.394 --> 00:55:44.335]  The patent was written out.
[00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:46.917]  The peak oil hoax was put out by Dutch World Shell.
[00:55:46.957 --> 00:55:48.939]  Greg Pallas, BBC, has the documents.
[00:55:49.159 --> 00:55:51.201]  But the fake liberals don't want to hear it.
[00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:53.943]  They want to be conned by the oil companies yet again.
[00:55:54.203 --> 00:55:56.465]  Listen, I don't want to breathe toxins.
[00:55:56.585 --> 00:55:58.266]  I don't want to have all these poisons.
[00:55:58.306 --> 00:55:59.687]  We should get on to new fuels.
[00:55:59.948 --> 00:56:02.650]  But the point is, is it's not destroying the planet.
[00:56:03.297 --> 00:56:03.837]  Sorry.
[00:56:04.077 --> 00:56:04.618]  That's right.
[00:56:04.798 --> 00:56:11.821]  I remember they came out with this new Freon, which is much more corrosive and not nearly as good quality as the original R12.
[00:56:12.601 --> 00:56:21.164]  My second point is the neocons seem to be flopping at the mouth lately about an impending attack by sleeper cells.
[00:56:21.865 --> 00:56:29.968]  I think the most disgusting of all the neocons, I listened to them just to see how skewed their propaganda is, is this guy Michael Savage.
[00:56:30.942 --> 00:56:32.263]  Every day he goes on and on.
[00:56:32.283 --> 00:56:35.104]  Oh yeah, they're getting ready to release a nuke in the United States.
[00:56:35.124 --> 00:56:36.105]  Do you know his history?
[00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:36.985]  Do you know his history?
[00:56:37.745 --> 00:56:38.266]  No, I don't.
[00:56:38.326 --> 00:56:45.249]  I just know he's a disgusting... He writes novels about men who lavish each other.
[00:56:46.034 --> 00:56:49.595]  And he writes love novels about his little tryst with his boyfriends.
[00:56:50.195 --> 00:56:51.356]  This is mainstream news.
[00:56:51.516 --> 00:56:52.476]  No, no, no, I'm not kidding.
[00:56:53.437 --> 00:56:54.197]  These are published.
[00:56:54.217 --> 00:56:56.678]  He was a best-selling author before he ever got a radio show.
[00:56:57.258 --> 00:56:57.698]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:57.838 --> 00:56:58.478]  Oh, top.
[00:56:58.718 --> 00:56:59.679]  Oh, you didn't know.
[00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:00.339]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:57:00.679 --> 00:57:02.219]  Top writer in that genre.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.140]  Oh, yes.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.201]  But let me add, top beatnik of the 60s.
[00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:08.722]  Top.
[00:57:09.302 --> 00:57:12.943]  So, of course, a dirtbag like him is going to be out there posing as a conservative.
[00:57:13.576 --> 00:57:14.497]  Yeah, he talks about it.
[00:57:14.537 --> 00:57:15.978]  Hey, you think you're a hateful savage?
[00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:18.841]  I hate big scum like you, you piece of filth!
[00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:21.224]  You think you got hatred, scum sucker?
[00:57:22.465 --> 00:57:24.207]  Sorry, sorry, that guy's a fake!
[00:57:24.447 --> 00:57:25.308]  He's a fake!
[00:57:25.668 --> 00:57:27.530]  He's a fake from the bowels of hell!
[00:57:28.459 --> 00:57:35.384]  I agree with you, Alex, and you know, your prediction that they're going to try another false flag terror operation seems to coincide with this.
[00:57:35.884 --> 00:57:40.907]  George Norrie was interviewing some former prosecutor on the air a couple, two or three nights ago.
[00:57:41.007 --> 00:57:42.628]  Peter Lance, give me a break.
[00:57:42.949 --> 00:57:49.133]  All that was it, yeah, and he was talking about, oh yeah, it's impending, and the intelligence community is looking the other way.
[00:57:49.193 --> 00:57:51.354]  They're inept and don't know what they're doing.
[00:57:51.694 --> 00:57:56.978]  And see, notice, I made the prediction they're going to launch an attack, and now look at them hyping it and getting it ready.
[00:57:57.558 --> 00:57:58.199]  Absolutely.
[00:57:58.299 --> 00:58:06.546]  I'm just waiting for the next tactical loop to go off in the United States, and then they can get their martial law rocking and rolling.
[00:58:06.966 --> 00:58:09.268]  They'll probably even claim Saddam did it or something.
[00:58:09.348 --> 00:58:12.971]  See, they had WMDs, but they already smuggled them here!
[00:58:12.991 --> 00:58:15.733]  I am your beatnik!
[00:58:16.614 --> 00:58:17.655]  I love men!
[00:58:17.675 --> 00:58:20.357]  I am... Oh, you love men!
[00:58:20.397 --> 00:58:21.138]  We love you!
[00:58:22.279 --> 00:58:23.480]  I'm sorry, what else is on your mind?
[00:58:24.244 --> 00:58:25.945]  Well, keep up the good work, Alex.
[00:58:26.065 --> 00:58:31.568]  I'm promoting your films, I'm making copies, and I'm a Prison Planet TV member.
[00:58:32.369 --> 00:58:34.290]  All right, I appreciate you joining us, sir.
[00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:34.810]  Take care.
[00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:36.891]  Oh, yeah.
[00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:40.673]  They couldn't win, so they posed as conservatives and they took the country down.
[00:58:41.534 --> 00:58:46.436]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.731 --> 00:58:58.371]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.052 --> 00:59:00.112]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.812 --> 00:59:01.972]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.552 --> 00:59:03.412]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.133 --> 00:59:05.053]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.713 --> 00:59:09.494]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.894 --> 00:59:14.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.095 --> 00:59:25.397]  Well, he's one of the esteemed and senior congressmen from New York, Charles Rangel.
[00:59:26.303 --> 00:59:28.585]  We've had him on the broadcast before a few years ago.
[00:59:28.605 --> 00:59:32.508]  I don't think he needs an introduction to this audience.
[00:59:33.209 --> 00:59:34.730]  This is a quick segment we'll break in a moment.
[00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:38.753]  We'll come back and talk more with Charles Rangel, but let's go ahead and go to him right now.
[00:59:39.514 --> 00:59:41.175]  Congressman, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:44.578]  Good to be on your show all the way there in Austin.
[00:59:45.242 --> 00:59:45.643]  That's right.
[00:59:45.663 --> 00:59:49.287]  Well, we're also on in upstate New York, so you're talking, I guess, to some of your constituents.
[00:59:50.508 --> 00:59:56.454]  The big announcement, you're saying that you're not going to run again for Congress if the Democrats don't win by win.
[00:59:56.514 --> 00:59:58.136]  How much do they need to win for you to stay?
[00:59:59.858 --> 01:00:02.721]  Well, that wasn't exactly the way it went.
[01:00:03.162 --> 01:00:04.143]  Okay, well, tell us, tell us.
[01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:23.598]  Well, I had an interview and I was sharing why I thought the Democrats would be winning and talked about the war and the fight against terrorism, the incompetency of the administration, the corruption, the deficit, the obscene tax cuts for the rich, the cuts in services of veterans.
[01:00:23.638 --> 01:00:29.764]  And so it went well, and then the reporter asked me from AP, but what happens if you don't win?
[01:00:29.784 --> 01:00:31.225]  It was such a horrible thought.
[01:00:31.897 --> 01:00:46.348]  That I said then, and agree now, that if the American people are willing to accept another two years, for two more years, the domestic and foreign policy of this president, then there's no place for me in the House.
[01:00:46.448 --> 01:00:55.395]  It doesn't mean I won't be active or won't be doing something, but I cannot see the Congress and the country...
[01:00:56.651 --> 01:01:01.736]  Just be devastated by these blind partisan positions and just sit on the bench.
[01:01:01.756 --> 01:01:08.342]  I'm 76, but there's too much life and energy in me to accept this happening to my country.
[01:01:08.642 --> 01:01:12.766]  And if I can't do anything in the Congress, I am prepared to do something outside.
[01:01:12.846 --> 01:01:17.991]  But quite frankly, I don't want to talk about this because from every indication...
[01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:30.015]  Americans are fed up with these things, and I am preparing and dealing with economists and all types of experts to see what we can do to sit down with Republicans and work together in a bipartisan way.
[01:01:30.095 --> 01:01:32.238]  So quitting is not on my mind.
[01:01:33.018 --> 01:01:37.804]  Well, Congressman Rangel, we appreciate you joining us and just shifting gears a bit.
[01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:49.374]  President Bush's chief strategist, Karl Rove, has leaked to neocon publications that he's planning to pull an October rabbit out of a hat blatantly in October.
[01:01:50.075 --> 01:01:51.717]  What do you think that surprise could be?
[01:01:52.578 --> 01:01:54.600]  Well, I don't know whether it's much of a surprise.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:59.686]  It's already been said that the Republicans are soliciting a lot of money to
[01:02:00.379 --> 01:02:23.787]  Distract from what looks like a negative reaction on a national agenda and what they intend to do is to try to bring the contest down to the individual congressional seats rather than have a referendum on President Bush and that by doing this they intend to have a very heavy finance negative campaign against the
[01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.755]  Well, it's pretty late in the game for that to work.
[01:02:26.775 --> 01:02:28.135]  Then they don't have time to respond.
[01:02:28.195 --> 01:02:29.876]  Look what they did to Cynthia McKinney, boy.
[01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:30.636]  They're always after her.
[01:02:51.914 --> 01:02:55.816]  Well, you know, when you know you're in the spotlight, you've got to fly under the radar.
[01:02:55.956 --> 01:03:07.822]  And sometimes there's a level of conduct that people expect, whether it's with guards or whether it's your lack of sensitivity to other people's feelings.
[01:03:08.822 --> 01:03:12.564]  And listen, these are things that you can expect.
[01:03:12.604 --> 01:03:21.108]  But you're 100% right that once they decide that there's any chink in the armor, any vulnerability, they exploit it.
[01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:32.192]  Unless it's vulnerabilities and chinks in the armor with Bush, no matter how much corruption he's involved in, it's all supposedly A-OK and wonderful, and we should just all accept it.
[01:03:32.492 --> 01:03:34.332]  Congressman Rangel, we've got a quick three-minute break.
[01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:44.014]  When we come back, I want to talk about the war in Iraq, what happened in Lebanon, Bush wanting to go into Iran, where you think all that's going, and how you see the election shaking out.
[01:03:44.334 --> 01:03:49.416]  We have the senior congressman, a Democrat from New York, joining us.
[01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.316]  Charles Rangel, stay with us.
[01:03:56.727 --> 01:03:59.910]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:02.212]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:10.218]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.899 --> 01:04:17.944]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.364 --> 01:04:21.327]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.627 --> 01:04:23.989]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.429 --> 01:04:25.210]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:26.377]  We're good to go.
[01:04:26.437 --> 01:04:27.257]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.539 --> 01:04:55.379]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:04:55.719 --> 01:04:57.260]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:57.900]  What?
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:58.620]  Again?
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.661]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:05:00.741 --> 01:05:05.161]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.682]  Why did you do that?
[01:05:06.882 --> 01:05:12.683]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:05:12.983 --> 01:05:14.003]  Are we there yet?
[01:05:14.123 --> 01:05:15.184]  for the entire trip.
[01:05:15.424 --> 01:05:17.624]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:05:18.104 --> 01:05:19.104]  Great idea.
[01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:22.005]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:05:22.345 --> 01:05:24.828]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:05:25.028 --> 01:05:29.412]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:30.013]  Honey?
[01:05:30.836 --> 01:05:32.077]  You're terrific!
[01:05:32.457 --> 01:05:33.958]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[01:05:34.058 --> 01:05:37.480]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.541]  Now can we stop?
[01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:39.782]  I need to go, too.

[01:06:05.937 --> 01:06:11.783]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest, greatest nutritional wonder products?
[01:06:12.123 --> 01:06:16.905]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.
[01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:27.550]  But what if you found from a single source the world's freshest, purest, most complete, whole, live food nourishment that tastes delicious and couldn't be any easier to consume?

[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:48.362]  805-595-2711.
[01:06:48.683 --> 01:07:00.793]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:04.436]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.777 --> 01:07:07.759]  We've just got him for one more segment.
[01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:09.240]  He's Congressman Charles Rangel.
[01:07:10.094 --> 01:07:14.557]  Himself a decorated veteran of the Korean conflict.
[01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:16.878]  And he joins us now.
[01:07:18.379 --> 01:07:22.142]  Congressman Hugo Chavez, and I want to get into the war in a second.
[01:07:22.182 --> 01:07:26.905]  Hugo Chavez obviously gave a speech and said he could smell the sulfur that the devil had been there.
[01:07:27.637 --> 01:07:29.598]  And quite frankly, I've got to say that's accurate.
[01:07:29.658 --> 01:07:32.519]  Bush is the devil if America is the promised land.
[01:07:32.899 --> 01:07:35.300]  He really is turning a country into a police state.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.001]  Spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:07:38.301 --> 01:07:42.283]  He is not a conservative, by the way, by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:07:43.323 --> 01:07:45.444]  What do you think of Hugo Chavez's statements?
[01:07:46.485 --> 01:07:50.246]  Well, it's strange you would say that because I just had a press conference.
[01:07:50.406 --> 01:07:54.568]  Hugo right now is still at a church in my congressional district.
[01:07:55.669 --> 01:08:11.143]  Condemning the president, and we've been the recipient of the generosity of the Venezuelan government giving to us the billions of barrels of home heating oil at 40% discount prices.
[01:08:11.343 --> 01:08:13.104]  Something our own federal government won't do.
[01:08:13.565 --> 01:08:16.908]  And something that our oil companies here won't do.
[01:08:17.577 --> 01:08:28.502]  But Alex, to tell you the truth, I made it clear at the press conference that I resent foreigners coming into my country, in my congressional district, condemning my president.
[01:08:29.002 --> 01:08:46.029]  And I don't want them to mistake the fact that because I criticize them or because the Americans that speak out in criticism about leaders, Republican or Democrat, that really should not give the right of foreigners to do the same thing.
[01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.030]  As a matter of fact,
[01:08:48.418 --> 01:08:54.623]  Whether or not I agree with the President, he still represents me and millions of Americans.
[01:08:54.663 --> 01:09:01.307]  Sure, sure, but Congressman, at the same time, most of his statements were made at the United Nations.
[01:09:01.527 --> 01:09:03.228]  I mean, where is he supposed to make it?
[01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:11.574]  Well, my comments in my press conferences is in response that he was doing this in my congressional district just a few hours ago.
[01:09:12.134 --> 01:09:12.695]  What did he say?
[01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:19.970]  Well, he went on to call the president a devil and to condemn him and, you know, just carried on.
[01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:20.670]  I love it.
[01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:26.515]  He had his personal relationship with Jesus and the crowd loved it too.
[01:09:26.635 --> 01:09:42.209]  But, you know, I represent my government and I just don't like foreigners being critical because I know one thing, that if I was critical of him and his country, I wouldn't be around.
[01:09:44.076 --> 01:09:46.758]  Oh, I bet Chavez would let you criticize his government down there.
[01:09:47.258 --> 01:09:50.400]  Well, I would not depend on that.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.481]  So did you tell Chavez this?
[01:09:53.641 --> 01:09:55.582]  No, I'm in Washington, D.C.
[01:09:55.642 --> 01:09:59.304]  He's in Harlem, where I should be if I weren't in session, you know.
[01:09:59.545 --> 01:10:00.385]  Sure, sure.
[01:10:00.885 --> 01:10:01.926]  Well, I mean, come on.
[01:10:02.246 --> 01:10:03.887]  Somebody's got to stand up against Bush.
[01:10:04.227 --> 01:10:05.508]  It should be Americans.
[01:10:05.728 --> 01:10:06.628]  You bet your life.
[01:10:06.789 --> 01:10:07.409]  You bet your life.
[01:10:07.429 --> 01:10:08.149]  I agree with you 100%.
[01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:11.071]  And that is one of the reasons why I think...
[01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:17.974]  And I'm pretty certain that we will take over the House and the Democratic Party as well.
[01:10:18.883 --> 01:10:20.484]  As probably the Senate.
[01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:23.946]  None of the electronic voting machines have their way.
[01:10:24.366 --> 01:10:25.067]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:10:25.127 --> 01:10:26.007]  That is a threat.
[01:10:26.428 --> 01:10:28.609]  What do you think of Chavez's comments about 9-11?
[01:10:28.869 --> 01:10:34.412]  Now, Congressman, we have a majority of Americans, 68%, believing there's a cover-up in a Zogby poll.
[01:10:34.632 --> 01:10:37.414]  In the same poll, 42% believing it was an inside job.
[01:10:37.774 --> 01:10:40.856]  Scripps-Hallard News Service, 36% believing it's an inside job.
[01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:44.038]  The majority of Americans believe there is a cover-up.
[01:10:44.578 --> 01:10:47.959]  And a majority of that group think that there's involvement.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:49.780]  Give us your take.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:50.180]  Come on.
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.661]  You're not going to live forever.
[01:10:51.961 --> 01:10:58.003]  Let us know what Charles Rangel and his gut... In your gut, you know 9-11 is a big stinking rat.
[01:10:58.223 --> 01:10:59.204]  What do you think about 9-11?
[01:11:00.164 --> 01:11:02.985]  I don't really think we have to resort to gut feelings.
[01:11:03.405 --> 01:11:07.267]  When we take over the House, we'd have to file a subpoena.
[01:11:07.307 --> 01:11:12.188]  We have witnesses to testify under oath, and we'll be able, believe me...
[01:11:14.093 --> 01:11:33.938]  Anytime you put our troops in harm's way, anytime we've lost some 2,600 men and women and got thousands of people that have been wounded and impaired for life, hundreds of thousands of innocent people killed, you bet your life that Congress has a responsibility to provide oversight with the rights of subpoenas.
[01:11:34.598 --> 01:11:41.780]  And the fact that we've been there and everyone says it's a mistake doesn't mean it was not wrongdoing.
[01:11:42.619 --> 01:12:02.704]  I know as a fact that there were meetings by the Project for a Better American Century with Wolfowitz and Cheney and Rumsfeld and the guy there at the United Nations and... Bolton.
[01:12:02.864 --> 01:12:03.384]  Bolton.
[01:12:03.849 --> 01:12:08.212]  And they had already, during the Clinton administration, they were planning to knock off Saddam Hussein.
[01:12:08.312 --> 01:12:10.534]  All they were looking for was some excuse.
[01:12:10.714 --> 01:12:17.119]  Yeah, they said they needed a helpful Pearl Harbor catalyzing event, and without that event, they couldn't get their agenda through.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:26.746]  Can I get you, Congressman, your take on a majority of your constituents believing that there is a 9-11 cover-up?
[01:12:26.766 --> 01:12:29.128]  I would think that...
[01:12:30.819 --> 01:12:45.130]  That a lot of them thought that the president knew that the information... The president knew or should have known that the information he was receiving was cherry-picked and that with all that came before him, he selected what he thought could have stretched the...
[01:12:46.178 --> 01:12:47.619]  I know, but you're a master, though.
[01:12:47.639 --> 01:12:56.046]  You keep going to Bush lying about intelligence to go to war, and certainly the experts are saying, Ron Paul on this show, fellow congressman with you, of course,
[01:13:07.074 --> 01:13:07.214]  Well...
[01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:39.053]  I don't really believe that the president thought that his big gamble would cost so many American lives.
[01:13:39.173 --> 01:14:00.844]  I really think that he allowed himself to believe that it was a slam dunk, that he could go over there and knock off Saddam Hussein, scare the hell out of Iran, and then share with Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Jordan that America was in charge and that they had to get out of the way of Israel and recognize us as a world power.
[01:14:01.289 --> 01:14:04.631]  And he just miscalculated and screwed up the whole thing.
[01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:07.633]  And so I don't think there's any question of that.
[01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:21.963]  I'm not prepared to say that he got us into this bloody war knowing that now he is saying that he has no clue as to how the hell he's going to get out and that it's going to take presidents in the future to work it out.
[01:14:22.864 --> 01:14:24.205]  You know, it's not so much him.
[01:14:24.265 --> 01:14:26.006]  I'm concerned with the American people.
[01:14:26.066 --> 01:14:28.828]  I don't mean to be avoiding or evading your question.
[01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:36.596]  That if that's what America really believes and wants, a president that could start a war and not know who the enemy is.
[01:14:36.656 --> 01:14:43.961]  You know, I oftentimes say that if Jesus came to me in the middle of the night and said, tell the president, your brother, that we, the enemy's got to surrender.
[01:14:44.469 --> 01:14:49.912]  All he has to do is describe who the enemy is, who he wants to surrender, what the conditions are.
[01:14:50.173 --> 01:14:53.635]  He has no clue as to the terrorist that he's created.
[01:14:53.675 --> 01:14:54.415]  Well, it's a perfect enemy.
[01:14:54.475 --> 01:14:55.976]  It's an enemy that can never be defeated.
[01:14:56.016 --> 01:14:58.237]  It's the Goldstein of Orwell.
[01:14:59.018 --> 01:15:04.481]  Congressman, you have a constituent, Mike McCormick, the guy that found the flag at Ground Zero, the big hero.
[01:15:04.841 --> 01:15:07.143]  He helped get some of the documents out about the dust.
[01:15:07.824 --> 01:15:11.208]  The mercury, the asbestos, he himself is sick from it.
[01:15:11.768 --> 01:15:18.417]  And three days after he went public at a meeting that I attended in front of the news cameras, he got raided by a federal SWAT team
[01:15:19.725 --> 01:15:20.826]  Have you heard about that case?
[01:15:21.286 --> 01:15:22.327]  I really haven't.
[01:15:22.447 --> 01:15:25.770]  I'm appalled, and I wish you could send me some information.
[01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:27.812]  That should not happen to any American.
[01:15:28.532 --> 01:15:30.114]  I'm really not surprised.
[01:15:30.514 --> 01:15:32.656]  Well, I'll get Mike McCormick to contact your office.
[01:15:32.676 --> 01:15:33.236]  Please do that.
[01:15:33.316 --> 01:15:34.557]  I'll do all that I can.
[01:15:34.637 --> 01:15:35.878]  What do you think of the dust, though?
[01:15:35.918 --> 01:15:41.963]  It's come out that Bush knew they were breathing it and cynically decided to block medical funding and even give these heroes funding.
[01:15:42.344 --> 01:15:46.387]  Well, they're catching hell now, and there's no reason why anybody that...
[01:15:46.847 --> 01:15:55.154]  Rush to be a first responder should have their health jeopardized without the federal government being there for them.
[01:15:55.474 --> 01:15:58.817]  They're just as much heroes as anybody that's fighting in Iraq.
[01:15:59.858 --> 01:16:00.638]  Well, I agree.
[01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:02.240]  And in closing, sir...
[01:16:03.613 --> 01:16:12.498]  You, of course, have introduced legislation in the last several Congresses, the Universal Service Act for a national draft of men and women, what, your version, 18 to 42.
[01:16:13.058 --> 01:16:16.940]  But I'm called a conspiracy theory when I talk about that legislation.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.901]  Does that legislation exist, A?
[01:16:19.281 --> 01:16:20.862]  And, B, why did you introduce it?
[01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:22.783]  Well, one, it exists.
[01:16:22.843 --> 01:16:23.663]  It's in committee.
[01:16:23.763 --> 01:16:26.645]  I don't expect that the Republicans would call it up.
[01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:28.906]  And I introduced it for two reasons.
[01:16:29.066 --> 01:16:29.166]  One,
[01:16:29.884 --> 01:16:34.145]  When our great country goes to war, there has to be a sense that we were endangered.
[01:16:34.945 --> 01:16:41.447]  I think a lot of people have advocated for the war, but they don't want to make any sacrifices for it.
[01:16:41.988 --> 01:16:53.751]  And when you're getting volunteers and paying them $20,000, $30,000, and $40,000 to be in harm's way, it just seems to me that this is a war where the not well-off are the ones paying for it.
[01:16:54.292 --> 01:16:57.634]  And the well-off are the ones that are actually supporting it.
[01:16:57.774 --> 01:17:05.759]  Well, Congressman, I mean, even if they go back to a draft, there's still going to be loopholes for the rich, and it's... That's just not so.
[01:17:05.799 --> 01:17:11.963]  First, we won't go back to the draft because it would be too easy to avoid getting involved in a war if you think you've got... That's right.
[01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:14.425]  Your universal service is even worse than the draft.
[01:17:15.245 --> 01:17:16.106]  I mean, it's even more wide-wide spread.
[01:17:16.146 --> 01:17:17.927]  What's not more universal service means is...
[01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:21.030]  You know, we've got bigger threats than just the war.
[01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:22.191]  We've got terrorist threats.
[01:17:22.251 --> 01:17:28.835]  We need eyes and ears and education to help our people, like in Katrina, in case there was a national disaster.
[01:17:28.855 --> 01:17:31.016]  You're talking about a big domestic core as well.
[01:17:31.036 --> 01:17:32.376]  Yes, you bet your life.
[01:17:32.957 --> 01:17:38.300]  There will be millions of people that will be called up to serve, men and women, and no exclusions.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.321]  None of this, the rich gets by.
[01:17:40.341 --> 01:17:42.462]  There would not be any exclusions at all.
[01:17:43.064 --> 01:17:47.546]  If you don't want to fight, there's something that you can do, and there's plenty to be done.
[01:17:47.946 --> 01:17:50.387]  You can look at the competency of the people at the airport.
[01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:55.749]  If there's another major terror attack, Congressman, do you think the legislation like yours will then finally be passed?
[01:17:56.189 --> 01:18:09.314]  I think that once they realize, this makes more sense than just trying to embarrass the President, once they realize that national security means that you get young people in our schools, our hospitals, our airports, our seaports,
[01:18:09.713 --> 01:18:11.074]  And these will be patriots.
[01:18:11.114 --> 01:18:14.797]  And not only that, that they'll be entitled to service education.
[01:18:15.157 --> 01:18:18.879]  We are so far behind in getting education available for our youth.
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:23.763]  Most nations have a free access to education.
[01:18:24.123 --> 01:18:27.546]  We have kids indebted for years after they're educated.
[01:18:27.866 --> 01:18:29.347]  This would pay for their education.
[01:18:29.367 --> 01:18:30.908]  Okay, we've got 20 seconds, Congressman.
[01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:34.330]  Will the Democrats get the House and the Senate, or just one of them?
[01:18:35.071 --> 01:18:37.853]  We definitely get one, and we have a great shot at the Senate.
[01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:39.334]  Which one do you think is guaranteed?
[01:18:39.992 --> 01:18:40.673]  Oh, come on.
[01:18:40.733 --> 01:18:41.335]  It's the House.
[01:18:41.595 --> 01:18:42.677]  The Senate has problems.
[01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:46.183]  Okay, but you're saying good chance that the Democrats get both?
[01:18:46.443 --> 01:18:47.565]  Better than a good chance.
[01:18:47.666 --> 01:18:49.629]  Even Democrats couldn't screw themselves.
[01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:50.991]  Thank you, Congressman.
[01:18:51.011 --> 01:18:51.713]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:18:52.073 --> 01:18:52.414]  Take care.
[01:18:53.678 --> 01:19:01.944]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:02.185 --> 01:19:06.548]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.848 --> 01:19:15.755]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.955 --> 01:19:19.578]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.878 --> 01:19:24.901]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons for one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:25.201 --> 01:19:31.924]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:19:32.405 --> 01:19:32.945]  What about you?
[01:19:33.701 --> 01:19:39.065]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:19:42.367 --> 01:19:42.808]  Hi, folks.
[01:19:42.828 --> 01:19:44.789]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:19:44.829 --> 01:19:45.489]  The real money, folks.
[01:20:02.039 --> 01:20:03.961]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:20:04.461 --> 01:20:05.322]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:05.362 --> 01:20:05.982]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:20:06.022 --> 01:20:06.403]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:06.423 --> 01:20:08.865]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:20:08.885 --> 01:20:10.746]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:10.766 --> 01:20:12.228]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[01:20:12.248 --> 01:20:13.809]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.563]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:20:33.123 --> 01:20:38.267]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.829 --> 01:20:43.491]  Remember, gold is liquid, private and portable.
[01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:47.114]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:20:47.555 --> 01:20:48.956]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.672 --> 01:20:57.053]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.514 --> 01:21:04.219]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[01:21:05.009 --> 01:21:05.609]  We're good to go.
[01:21:32.214 --> 01:21:33.875]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:33.895 --> 01:21:34.255]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:34.295 --> 01:21:34.875]  Call now.
[01:21:35.095 --> 01:21:40.076]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:54.082 --> 01:21:56.564]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:21:56.684 --> 01:21:59.046]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:21:59.106 --> 01:22:05.291]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:22:06.772 --> 01:22:09.074]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:22:09.735 --> 01:22:13.277]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:22:13.818 --> 01:22:17.961]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:22:18.522 --> 01:22:21.484]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:22:22.463 --> 01:22:25.385]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:22:26.125 --> 01:22:31.868]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:22:31.928 --> 01:22:35.910]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:22:36.691 --> 01:22:40.032]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[01:22:40.113 --> 01:22:43.034]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:22:43.995 --> 01:22:46.296]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:22:46.356 --> 01:22:50.538]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[01:22:50.878 --> 01:22:51.839]  And ask for George.
[01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:06.533]  Last week we talked to Mike McCormick, Major Mike McCormick, one of the emergency workers that saved a lot of people.
[01:23:07.294 --> 01:23:10.456]  He went into the rubble, the fellow that found the American flag.
[01:23:10.476 --> 01:23:11.817]  He's been all over national television.
[01:23:12.538 --> 01:23:15.760]  And he's gone public about the poison dust and helped get some of the documents out.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.241]  So we got SWAT teamed last week.
[01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:20.410]  And we had Congressman Rangel on.
[01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:23.270]  I had wanted to be notified when McCormick got online.
[01:23:24.231 --> 01:23:27.072]  We crossed our wires so he didn't get to get on when Rangel was with us.
[01:23:28.352 --> 01:23:35.154]  But regardless, Mike, I brought up your case to the Congressman so you can contact him now if you need to.
[01:23:35.674 --> 01:23:37.915]  But you had already talked to folks at my office.
[01:23:37.935 --> 01:23:42.116]  You told me you got a lot of calls from media and others after you came on last week, my friend.
[01:23:43.016 --> 01:23:44.237]  That's correct, Alex.
[01:23:45.697 --> 01:23:47.838]  I've gotten calls as far as...
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.802]  United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany.
[01:23:51.822 --> 01:23:54.164]  I mean, the calls are flooding in.
[01:23:54.744 --> 01:24:03.391]  Unfortunately, there hasn't been many calls regarding the assistance that I asked for.
[01:24:03.891 --> 01:24:08.515]  However, I get solace knowing that
[01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:11.623]  The message is being put out.
[01:24:11.763 --> 01:24:12.163]  That's right.
[01:24:12.463 --> 01:24:15.024]  They tricked you into signing an agreement to let them in your house.
[01:24:15.444 --> 01:24:18.785]  Then minutes later, after the detectives got there, they sent in a federal SWAT team.
[01:24:18.825 --> 01:24:22.426]  They found an unloaded gun in the supposed free country of America.
[01:24:23.047 --> 01:24:25.267]  You even have a permit in the nearby state to have.
[01:24:25.287 --> 01:24:28.388]  There's a 48-hour travel permit, but they don't care.
[01:24:28.708 --> 01:24:33.910]  They're charging you with that right now, and you need some type of legal help in the state or city of New York.
[01:24:35.431 --> 01:24:36.651]  That's correct, Alex.
[01:24:37.651 --> 01:24:38.692]  One thing I wanted to...
[01:24:39.918 --> 01:24:52.882]  Make you aware of... During the interview last week, I was a major, but I was not in the U.S.
[01:24:53.002 --> 01:24:53.302]  Army.
[01:24:53.842 --> 01:24:56.563]  It was an emergency services unit.
[01:24:56.843 --> 01:24:57.664]  Yeah, we understand that.
[01:24:57.704 --> 01:24:58.144]  Yeah, sure.
[01:24:58.924 --> 01:25:04.266]  And also, I was not a paid asset for Homeland Security.
[01:25:04.286 --> 01:25:08.147]  I don't think we brought that up in the interview, but...
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:09.460]  Sure.
[01:25:09.861 --> 01:25:16.404]  I've been involved with it, teaching EMS, working for different agencies.
[01:25:16.924 --> 01:25:18.285]  I've been involved with it.
[01:25:19.705 --> 01:25:34.573]  However, at this point, I am just so totally disgusted and heartbroken with the entire country that I never thought that I would just say,
[01:25:35.399 --> 01:25:40.823]  I'd rather not get up in the morning out of total disgust and dismay.
[01:25:42.264 --> 01:25:46.907]  Well, we've tried to give as much attention to your plot as we can, and we'll continue to watch it and track it.
[01:25:47.207 --> 01:25:55.072]  We're about to put up the video on the web of the interview that we did with you, both your speech and the interview we did with you in New York.
[01:25:55.412 --> 01:25:56.853]  Mike, you've got my number.
[01:25:56.873 --> 01:25:59.675]  As things develop, if you need any help or anything, give me a call, okay?
[01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:01.394]  You got it.
[01:26:01.655 --> 01:26:04.016]  You better give Congressman Rangel's office a call.
[01:26:04.056 --> 01:26:05.818]  He may be able to help you.
[01:26:06.038 --> 01:26:09.561]  Do you know when your first court date is?
[01:26:10.762 --> 01:26:13.664]  Yeah, my first court date is the 6th of November.
[01:26:14.284 --> 01:26:22.130]  You know, the worst thing about it is the ulterior motive.
[01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:28.135]  And the ulterior motive seems to be nothing more than character assassination.
[01:26:28.996 --> 01:26:29.396]  Because
[01:26:30.424 --> 01:26:36.266]  Digging up the flag, being a hero, and I mean, I don't look at myself as a hero.
[01:26:36.326 --> 01:26:37.726]  But that's what they said you were, yeah.
[01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:56.171]  Yeah, but you know, you can be the poster boy one day, and the next day you're handcuffed to a wall, and the only reason you're really handcuffed to the wall is because you're tired of seeing responders die.
[01:26:57.168 --> 01:26:59.450]  You don't want to see cops die.
[01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:04.674]  You don't want to see firemen die, EMS or any kind of responder sick.
[01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:10.680]  And in the last three weeks, I've been with responders.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.382]  One guy needs a double lung transplant.
[01:27:14.143 --> 01:27:21.189]  Another guy was a National Guardsman who served in the first Gulf War, David Miller, that you know.
[01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:22.430]  Well, he was really sick.
[01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.831]  How's he doing this week?
[01:27:26.717 --> 01:27:32.499]  He's kind of staying at that plateau because he cannot get any sicker.
[01:27:32.559 --> 01:27:37.041]  He's at the verge where the doctor gave him 90 days and
[01:27:38.766 --> 01:27:45.307]  I'm just disgusted in seeing people that I befriend die, and there's nothing I can do to save them.
[01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:51.268]  Well, Mike, you and others have helped expose the fact that the government knew what the dust was doing, and they're in deep water right now.
[01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.789]  That's why they're coming after you and others.
[01:27:53.889 --> 01:27:57.109]  Have a great Friday, and have a great weekend, my friend, and we'll talk to you soon.
[01:27:57.849 --> 01:27:58.910]  You take care, Alex.
[01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:00.130]  Take care, Mike.
[01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:01.690]  And we wrote an article about this.
[01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:06.231]  If folks want to get in contact with you, it's up on prisonplanet.com, and your number's right there, my friend.
[01:28:07.288 --> 01:28:08.969]  Okay, you've got to keep the faith.
[01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.672]  We'll try our best to continue to expose this evil.
[01:28:11.712 --> 01:28:12.112]  Take care.
[01:28:12.132 --> 01:28:21.059]  All right, when we get back, we'll go to Brett, Dino, James, Ron, Rico, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:28.445]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:28.905 --> 01:28:29.866]  We'll go to your calls.
[01:28:29.886 --> 01:28:33.569]  I also want to get into NBA students likelier to cheat.
[01:28:35.042 --> 01:28:37.464]  58% surveyed, acknowledged dishonesty.
[01:28:39.006 --> 01:28:39.687]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:39.727 --> 01:28:40.207]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.211 --> 01:28:45.132]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:47.214]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.115 --> 01:28:50.838]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.542 --> 01:28:56.864]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:28:57.124 --> 01:28:59.166]  When was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:30:08.874 --> 01:30:20.398]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.

[01:30:54.181 --> 01:30:58.842]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:30:58.882 --> 01:30:59.603]  have diabetes.
[01:30:59.943 --> 01:31:06.885]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:31:07.025 --> 01:31:11.546]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:14.567]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:31:54.650 --> 01:31:59.812]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.472 --> 01:32:02.853]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:05.614 --> 01:32:09.616]  We are becoming a decadent and degenerate society.
[01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:15.758]  We have gotten fat, dumb, and happy off of the labor of our forefathers and mothers.
[01:32:17.559 --> 01:32:20.340]  And not only do the yuppies, the so-called middle class...
[01:32:22.174 --> 01:32:28.296]  groups out there in the Western world believe that only caring about themselves gets them ahead.
[01:32:28.316 --> 01:32:35.339]  They also think that they can lie, they can cheat, they can steal, and that that is going to be acceptable.
[01:32:35.399 --> 01:32:48.303]  But pretty soon when an entire society starts to lie, cheat, and steal, that society comes to a screeching halt and falls apart and implodes on itself, and you end up looking like India or Mexico.
[01:32:49.663 --> 01:32:51.044]  And that's the way the U.S.
[01:32:51.104 --> 01:32:51.544]  is going.
[01:32:52.854 --> 01:32:58.139]  But the gibbering public is so stupid, they won't even know it while they're slaves.
[01:32:58.159 --> 01:33:06.627]  I mean, I would take some solace in it of, ha ha, all you corrupt yuppies think you're going to get power out of this, but you're really going to just destroy your future.
[01:33:06.927 --> 01:33:08.088]  But they won't know that.
[01:33:09.549 --> 01:33:14.253]  I mean, as long as they're ruling over some clutch of monkeys somewhere, they won't care.
[01:33:14.274 --> 01:33:19.038]  They'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven, as the saying goes.
[01:33:20.618 --> 01:33:22.478]  This is out of the Toronto Star today.
[01:33:23.759 --> 01:33:27.019]  MBA students likelier to cheat.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.720]  56% surveyed acknowledge dishonesty.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:34.321]  Study blames focus on getting a job done.
[01:33:35.281 --> 01:33:37.121]  Who says cheaters never prosper?
[01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:46.123]  MBA students in Canada and the United States are more likely to cheat than students in other disciplines because they believe it is how the business world operates.
[01:33:46.283 --> 01:33:50.144]  Well, that's not how it operated in the past.
[01:33:50.834 --> 01:33:55.256]  And people don't want to work with you or be around you if you do cheat and lie.
[01:33:55.776 --> 01:33:57.457]  Though, no, I don't know.
[01:33:57.517 --> 01:34:00.278]  Here locally, I've kind of seen that in the patriot community.
[01:34:00.639 --> 01:34:06.701]  People like the liar, the cheater, the person that congenitally lies.
[01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:15.665]  I just got an email the other day where I was told, we like this person and we don't like you because I don't lie and cheat and do all of these things.
[01:34:16.026 --> 01:34:16.606]  I am bad.
[01:34:17.228 --> 01:34:17.929]  We're good to go.
[01:34:44.272 --> 01:34:51.038]  Jim Fisher, Vice Dean of MBA Programs at the University of Toronto's Rodham School of Management, said he wasn't surprised by the new development.
[01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:25.178]  And they've also had polls where the majority of college seniors across the board don't know what the Bill of Rights is, and when they're given examples, they believe it's bad.
[01:35:26.958 --> 01:35:31.040]  They believe the Second Amendment, First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fifth, Tenth, it's all bad.
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:38.382]  They believe black mask and torture and evil and corruption and secret arrest is good.
[01:35:38.402 --> 01:35:41.723]  Because they watch shows like CSI where it's glorified.
[01:35:46.127 --> 01:35:55.874]  And one academic expert said, those numbers are probably underreported, said Donald McCabe, lead researcher of the study and business strategy professor at Rutgers.
[01:35:56.995 --> 01:35:57.496]  I agree.
[01:35:57.516 --> 01:36:03.360]  It says, since the survey was voluntary, more dishonest students were less likely to fill out the survey.
[01:36:04.181 --> 01:36:04.701]  Exactly.
[01:36:05.968 --> 01:36:16.954]  I've studied polls and surveys, and it's one of the main rules of it, that if it's a controversial question, people will err generally on the less controversial answer and will lie.
[01:36:18.235 --> 01:36:22.017]  So, 36% believe the government carried out 9-11.
[01:36:23.458 --> 01:36:25.299]  It's probably 60-plus percent.
[01:36:26.119 --> 01:36:31.762]  I mean, the average person gets a call, Hello, this is Scripps Howard, Ohio, surveyed.
[01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:34.144]  Do you believe the government was involved in 9-11?
[01:36:36.444 --> 01:36:38.545]  36% say yes, it's a lot higher.
[01:36:38.625 --> 01:36:44.228]  Most people, even if they think it's an inside job, are still going to be afraid and go, no, no, I don't think it's an inside job.
[01:36:44.829 --> 01:36:50.232]  Just like Zodby, 42% believe inside job, 68% believe cover-up.
[01:36:51.693 --> 01:36:56.595]  I would imagine it's more like 68% believe inside job, 90% believe cover-up.
[01:36:57.656 --> 01:37:04.880]  And they go on here to say that if 56% say they lie and cheat, it's probably much higher.
[01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:16.486]  And I remember in college that I had friends who told me how they cheated on their test scores.
[01:37:17.867 --> 01:37:20.269]  Personally, I just thought the whole thing was a joke.
[01:37:21.049 --> 01:37:26.893]  Having foreigners who couldn't even speak English sit up there and teach me things they knew nothing about.
[01:37:26.913 --> 01:37:28.994]  I just quit college.
[01:37:29.014 --> 01:37:30.255]  It was a complete waste of time.
[01:37:31.435 --> 01:37:32.896]  But that's what college is.
[01:37:32.976 --> 01:37:34.077]  It's a bunch of foreigners...
[01:37:35.066 --> 01:37:35.826]  We're good to go.
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.221]  I don't know what they're learning in business school.
[01:38:08.321 --> 01:38:09.862]  I don't know what they're learning in the arts.
[01:38:09.942 --> 01:38:14.005]  I don't know what you're paying for, you know, sociology, psychology.
[01:38:14.025 --> 01:38:15.005]  It's a big joke.
[01:38:16.386 --> 01:38:17.987]  I mean, really, it is a big joke.
[01:38:18.767 --> 01:38:22.169]  And it might not have been 20, 30 years ago.
[01:38:22.209 --> 01:38:23.890]  I mean, you've got top flight professors.
[01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:26.231]  You've got to sit there in the big auditorium seating.
[01:38:26.251 --> 01:38:27.632]  You've got to have real discussions.
[01:38:28.132 --> 01:38:31.134]  Now you go in there, folks, and there will be a foreigner who speaks no English.
[01:38:31.838 --> 01:38:36.160]  And they will walk in and give you your assignment for five minutes and walk out.
[01:38:37.221 --> 01:38:39.202]  And, I mean, that's even mid-level courses.
[01:38:39.322 --> 01:38:46.665]  So let me tell parents right now, do not waste your children's time sending them to college unless you're sending your daughter to find a rich husband.
[01:38:47.806 --> 01:38:48.966]  I know that's what most of you do.
[01:38:49.287 --> 01:38:51.428]  That's the main reason for women to go to college nowadays.
[01:38:52.248 --> 01:38:54.609]  But that's the funny thing.
[01:38:55.049 --> 01:38:58.071]  Sixty percent of college graduates now in this country are women.
[01:38:59.184 --> 01:39:04.087]  They're talking about this big gap and, oh, men, men, you know, are being left behind.
[01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:19.337]  We aren't given grants or money to go to college and men are ignored and men are, you know, oh, poor men, but it's still men making the most money, men starting most of the new businesses, men doing the best in business because men are the most highly motivated.
[01:39:19.977 --> 01:39:23.740]  And I'm not saying there aren't really smart, super cool women who will outdo a man any day.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:28.423]  My point is that these colleges are a joke.
[01:39:29.514 --> 01:39:32.917]  Okay, now I've really digressed off the map, and I apologize.
[01:39:34.859 --> 01:39:36.881]  Obviously, a lot of you get something great out of college.
[01:39:38.922 --> 01:39:42.426]  And I just, more and more, it's a joke.
[01:39:42.466 --> 01:39:43.366]  That's my point.
[01:39:44.628 --> 01:39:50.313]  I mean, it must be failing if the vast majority don't know what the First Amendment is, and 56% think cheating's good.
[01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:55.331]  Because that's how you get ahead in business.
[01:39:55.851 --> 01:39:57.471]  No, that's not how you get ahead in business.
[01:39:57.491 --> 01:40:00.252]  You might get ahead for a few months, then you get caught.
[01:40:00.792 --> 01:40:02.053]  Then you lose your job.
[01:40:02.173 --> 01:40:03.253]  Then you go to jail.
[01:40:03.533 --> 01:40:05.494]  Then you get a bad name in the community.
[01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:07.734]  Now, that's mid-level.
[01:40:08.155 --> 01:40:12.576]  Cheating and stealing is the way at the higher levels, and I guess people are talking about that.
[01:40:14.585 --> 01:40:16.646]  But again, then it's a synthesis of evil.
[01:40:16.966 --> 01:40:21.289]  You've got really smart evil people up above you who use your corruption to burn you.
[01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:23.730]  More of a reason to not be involved in corruption.
[01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:25.951]  All right, now I really have digressed.
[01:40:25.991 --> 01:40:28.193]  Let's go to your calls here today.
[01:40:28.213 --> 01:40:31.995]  Brett, where are you calling us from?
[01:40:32.015 --> 01:40:32.715]  Missouri.
[01:40:32.955 --> 01:40:33.676]  Hello, my friend.
[01:40:33.696 --> 01:40:34.656]  How are you doing today?
[01:40:35.017 --> 01:40:35.517]  Pretty good.
[01:40:35.537 --> 01:40:39.859]  Hey, a little bit off topic today, but it's kind of stuck in my mind because I just heard it this morning.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.721]  Aaron Russo was on Mancow's show.
[01:40:43.823 --> 01:40:48.327]  And the more I listen to it, I think Man Cow is controlled, and I wondered what you thought about that.
[01:40:48.587 --> 01:40:49.888]  I haven't been on Man Cow lately.
[01:40:49.928 --> 01:40:50.929]  I need to get back on the show.
[01:40:50.949 --> 01:41:04.219]  I know he's got a lot of listeners, and I appreciate him having me on to talk about issues that are important, and I'm not going to bash venues that let me get on and reach millions of people, but I'm not a listener to Man Cow, so I don't know.
[01:41:04.699 --> 01:41:06.320]  He seems pretty fair when I'm on the show.
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.543]  He lets me come on and talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:41:09.983 --> 01:41:12.745]  Well, Russo was talking about his movie.
[01:41:12.825 --> 01:41:13.486]  I mean, they openly...
[01:41:14.236 --> 01:41:15.456]  Mancow, I will give him credit.
[01:41:15.476 --> 01:41:17.057]  He openly talks about the New World Order.
[01:41:17.077 --> 01:41:19.117]  They talked about the big banks running everything.
[01:41:19.197 --> 01:41:25.978]  But the one thing that caught my attention was the subject of 9-11 come up and Russo mentioned Building 7.
[01:41:27.099 --> 01:41:31.059]  And Mancow says, you know, I don't believe in the conspiracies.
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.060]  I don't believe a plane hit the Pentagon.
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.440]  And Russo, I give him credit.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.881]  He held his ground well.
[01:41:36.941 --> 01:41:39.521]  And he said, all I'm asking about is Building 7.
[01:41:39.701 --> 01:41:41.241]  He said, I'm not talking about the Pentagon.
[01:41:41.402 --> 01:41:43.322]  He said, explain to me how Building 7 fell.
[01:41:44.346 --> 01:41:57.454]  Phil, and Mancow just really seemed to avoid that question and kept trying to steer the conversation away from Building 7 and, you know, kind of start going down the conspiracy route.
[01:41:57.574 --> 01:42:00.055]  And Russo just said, hey, all I'm talking about is Building 7.
[01:42:00.116 --> 01:42:01.857]  Sure, yeah.
[01:42:01.877 --> 01:42:03.578]  And so that kind of made me wonder.
[01:42:03.778 --> 01:42:07.700]  And, you know, and then earlier in the conversation they were talking about, oh, the –
[01:42:09.813 --> 01:42:18.159]  The elections and voting fraud, and Mankow, he said that he didn't believe that Bush stole Ohio.
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:25.965]  Well, it's good that we don't have to judge the world through the eyes of Mankow.
[01:42:26.125 --> 01:42:28.647]  I mean, we have the evidence that there's election fraud.
[01:42:28.948 --> 01:42:37.354]  Yeah, I was just curious on your take on it, because he has a pretty vast audience, and there's a big part of me that appreciates what he's doing, but then it makes me wonder...
[01:42:37.859 --> 01:42:39.980]  If he's not part of the bigger picture.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.101]  I think people like Mankow are trying to survive and keep their radio show.
[01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:51.062]  I'm not too intellectual in the radio business, so I'm not really sure.
[01:42:51.862 --> 01:42:53.563]  I don't listen to the show, so I don't know.
[01:42:54.443 --> 01:42:58.264]  If you have another minute or so, I was curious about Mike Judge.
[01:42:58.995 --> 01:43:00.016]  Good guy.
[01:43:00.056 --> 01:43:01.198]  Knows all about the New World Order.
[01:43:01.878 --> 01:43:02.339]  Obviously.
[01:43:03.139 --> 01:43:04.461]  Oh, you've seen Idiocracy now?
[01:43:04.701 --> 01:43:16.253]  No, I haven't seen Idiocracy, but I've watched King of the Hill over the years, and there has been some very numerous comments made in the dialogue on the animated cartoon King of the Hill.
[01:43:17.193 --> 01:43:21.598]  And I was just curious on how he gets away with that on the Fox network.
[01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:25.644]  Well, he gets away with it because he's had other hit TV shows.
[01:43:26.264 --> 01:43:33.188]  But his Idiocracy, which really takes aim at the New World Order, would have been a big movie, but Fox did kill it.
[01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:38.832]  And literally just said, we're not going to distribute this, and so it's dying on the vine.
[01:43:38.872 --> 01:43:41.394]  I think it's only in like 20 or 30 cities right now.
[01:43:42.394 --> 01:43:50.099]  And I keep meaning to write an article about Idiocracy and maybe even try to get Mike Judge on, but that's basically it.
[01:43:50.825 --> 01:44:05.168]  Okay, I was just curious, you know, because there's been some pretty blatant undertones on some of his series that were on the Fox network, and I just wondered if he was flipping that stuff in, or if they were just letting him go away with a certain amount of it, or, you know, I wasn't sure how that worked.
[01:44:05.308 --> 01:44:06.368]  Yep, thanks for the call.
[01:44:06.388 --> 01:44:07.068]  Appreciate it.
[01:44:07.648 --> 01:44:09.508]  Dino, where are you calling us from?
[01:44:09.528 --> 01:44:10.969]  Hi, Alex.
[01:44:10.989 --> 01:44:12.729]  Yes, where are you calling us from?
[01:44:13.529 --> 01:44:14.409]  Eugene, Oregon.
[01:44:14.529 --> 01:44:14.909]  Welcome.
[01:44:15.650 --> 01:44:17.570]  You know, I became an info warrior...
[01:44:19.464 --> 01:44:22.426]  After about six months of listening to you.
[01:44:23.607 --> 01:44:25.048]  And it's the hardest job I've ever had.
[01:44:25.969 --> 01:44:27.049]  It's fun, though, isn't it?
[01:44:27.630 --> 01:44:40.078]  It is, but the first couple times that I went out there to restaurants and I told people, hey, 9-11 was an inside job and here's some information, the next day I got home and I was worried that I was going to get in trouble, I was going to get a call, get arrested.
[01:44:40.098 --> 01:44:41.799]  I mean, it's a hard life to lead.
[01:44:42.219 --> 01:44:45.722]  But every morning when I wake up, my brain tells me, don't forget about 9-11.
[01:44:45.822 --> 01:44:47.423]  Don't forget it was an inside job.
[01:44:47.523 --> 01:44:49.004]  Don't forget to tell people about it.
[01:44:50.672 --> 01:44:55.055]  Well, I mean, listen, we're in a lot of trouble if we don't expose this.
[01:44:55.695 --> 01:44:57.897]  Have you seen the new reports from Dubai?
[01:44:59.098 --> 01:45:04.521]  The interviewer, the last name of M-I-R, Murr, he interviewed Osama bin Laden.
[01:45:05.322 --> 01:45:17.570]  He's interviewed a Taliban general recently that says, I have it here on World Net Daily and a few other places where...
[01:45:18.783 --> 01:45:22.324]  It says that they've already got a nuke inside America.
[01:45:22.544 --> 01:45:42.451]  Yeah, no, I mean, listen, I put the alert out a month ago saying this is the prime zone the next few months for a staged government terror attack, and they're pulling out all the stops for the election, hyping that it's about to happen, and anybody who believes bin Laden is still alive, anybody who believes these interviews are real, I got a bridge I want to sell them.
[01:45:43.371 --> 01:45:45.112]  You're thinking he's just making this all up.
[01:45:45.452 --> 01:45:46.633]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:45:46.793 --> 01:45:47.613]  Come on.
[01:45:47.653 --> 01:45:49.274]  The interview of Mir, M-I-R.
[01:45:50.054 --> 01:45:53.416]  Man, all this new stuff, yeah, it's all a complete joke.
[01:45:53.436 --> 01:45:54.356]  I mean, come on.
[01:45:54.376 --> 01:45:58.999]  They're going to let off a nuke in Washington and New York as soon as we bomb Iran.
[01:45:59.019 --> 01:46:03.501]  Yeah, so why is Bush rushing to bomb Iran?
[01:46:04.881 --> 01:46:07.843]  Because he wants a nuke to go off so that he can start his whole...
[01:46:08.775 --> 01:46:09.435]  Martial law.
[01:46:09.475 --> 01:46:14.817]  But my question to you is, do you think that bin Laden is real and that he's really going to detonate a nuke?
[01:46:15.657 --> 01:46:23.299]  No, bin Laden is an asset of the CIA, Kim Osmond, and it's obvious that they're just using them against us so that they can cause all of this chaos.
[01:46:23.919 --> 01:46:24.719]  That's it, my friend.
[01:46:24.759 --> 01:46:25.820]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:35.142]  Number one, the fat bin Laden, Jay, that's been out for three and a half years is an admitted fake.
[01:46:35.902 --> 01:46:36.603]  Does it matter?
[01:46:36.683 --> 01:46:37.903]  The news still uses him.
[01:46:39.227 --> 01:46:43.930]  They have claimed that they've killed different Al-Qaeda operatives, in some cases over ten times.
[01:46:44.491 --> 01:46:50.255]  They will announce they've killed the same person over and over and over again, and never even retract the previous story.
[01:46:50.555 --> 01:46:52.176]  They do that on purpose.
[01:46:52.216 --> 01:46:56.619]  They're setting a precedent to just enter a comic book world.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.601]  None of it has any connection to reality.
[01:47:00.902 --> 01:47:04.885]  Then there's all these old videos of bin Laden outside the same cave.
[01:47:04.925 --> 01:47:05.966]  They're in that little valley.
[01:47:06.666 --> 01:47:08.708]  They're there in that little valley, in that little cliffside.
[01:47:09.552 --> 01:47:15.337]  And over and over again after that, a new Bin Laden tape, Fox, breaking news, released by Al Jazeera.
[01:47:15.797 --> 01:47:16.758]  Al C.I.A.
[01:47:16.798 --> 01:47:17.339]  Jazeera.
[01:47:18.239 --> 01:47:20.461]  And it's always the same thing.
[01:47:20.841 --> 01:47:26.386]  And then a week later they go, oh, that was actually re-edited old tapes of hundreds of hours pre-9-11.
[01:47:27.387 --> 01:47:28.367]  You can always watch it.
[01:47:28.407 --> 01:47:32.751]  It's the same clip, the same Bin Laden video, the same thing, the same person.
[01:47:33.372 --> 01:47:36.054]  So when it's a real Bin Laden tape, it's pre-9-11.
[01:47:37.175 --> 01:47:38.836]  Or the one or two that happen in the month after.
[01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:43.832]  Or it's a fat bin Laden, which they did voice print on, isn't bin Laden.
[01:47:43.852 --> 01:47:45.733]  I mean, you could look at it and tell it wasn't him.
[01:47:47.174 --> 01:47:49.036]  How many times did they kill Chemical Ali?
[01:47:49.116 --> 01:47:49.676]  Three times.
[01:47:50.076 --> 01:47:52.818]  How many times did they kill the Saddam boys?
[01:47:53.499 --> 01:47:59.583]  I mean, they just... They must think we are completely and totally stupid.
[01:48:01.124 --> 01:48:09.731]  And just because Bush says a nuke will go off, and just because they say we're going to be hit by terrorists, and just because Karl Rove says there will be an October surprise...
[01:48:11.343 --> 01:48:13.524]  That doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[01:48:13.544 --> 01:48:14.905]  They say that every election.
[01:48:14.945 --> 01:48:17.046]  They said that in 2004.
[01:48:17.526 --> 01:48:19.026]  And they said it in 2006.
[01:48:19.146 --> 01:48:21.948]  I mean, they're saying it right now.
[01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:25.929]  They say it every two years at every congressional election.
[01:48:27.670 --> 01:48:33.172]  What makes me think they may be really ready to do it is they're massing troops near Iran.
[01:48:33.212 --> 01:48:34.753]  They're building up troops in Iraq.
[01:48:34.773 --> 01:48:36.594]  They've got the aircraft carriers over there.
[01:48:37.222 --> 01:48:39.343]  They're telling the minesweepers to get in position.
[01:48:39.363 --> 01:48:41.605]  They're telling the public they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[01:48:42.005 --> 01:48:44.246]  Israel's openly saying they're getting ready to hit Iran.
[01:48:44.566 --> 01:48:47.028]  The media's telling us terrorists are about to hit us any minute.
[01:48:47.368 --> 01:48:49.249]  The whole neocon agenda's in trouble.
[01:48:49.829 --> 01:48:59.515]  And so, yeah, you put all that together, and these killers have hit us before with Oklahoma City and the First World Trade Center attack and 9-11 and the rest of it.
[01:48:59.575 --> 01:49:04.978]  So, yes, they are very capable, and right now is the prime time danger of,
[01:49:06.284 --> 01:49:07.145]  For this to happen.
[01:49:10.547 --> 01:49:19.894]  And so I have said that I believe barring a huge public hue and cry exposing government sponsored terror that we're going to see big events by late October.
[01:49:20.535 --> 01:49:21.535]  And I stand by that.
[01:49:22.776 --> 01:49:26.319]  Though there has been a big hue and cry and big demonstrations in D.C.
[01:49:26.379 --> 01:49:34.305]  and New York and all over the country and right here on the air and Fox News has even covered my prediction that we have a chance
[01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:36.150]  I'm backing them off.
[01:49:36.891 --> 01:49:42.118]  But we are still on thin ice, hot water, whatever you want to call it.
[01:49:42.238 --> 01:49:44.881]  We are in very serious times right now.
[01:49:45.742 --> 01:49:47.044]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[01:49:47.084 --> 01:49:49.246]  Got a bunch of North American Union news as well.
[01:49:49.647 --> 01:49:50.568]  And we got some guests.
[01:49:56.912 --> 01:50:00.093]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.413 --> 01:50:02.333]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.733 --> 01:50:10.395]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.075 --> 01:50:18.116]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.537 --> 01:50:21.457]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.857 --> 01:50:24.178]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.598 --> 01:50:25.418]  NSA spies.
[01:50:25.988 --> 01:50:27.328]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:27.348 --> 01:50:29.249]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:50:54.531 --> 01:50:58.097]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[01:50:58.297 --> 01:51:04.166]  The water east of the Continental Divide travels downhill over 1600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:51:04.346 --> 01:51:07.531]  On the western side, water travels downhill almost a thousand miles
[01:51:12.062 --> 01:51:16.346]  How many people and animals has that water passed through before it reaches my area?
[01:51:31.186 --> 01:51:31.626]  We're good to go.

[01:52:56.310 --> 01:53:02.333]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.953 --> 01:53:05.895]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.169 --> 01:53:09.090]  Hey, this isn't hype.
[01:53:09.150 --> 01:53:10.410]  I'm serious when I say it.
[01:53:11.471 --> 01:53:18.555]  Documentary films, high quality, high powered documentary films are the way to go to wake people up about government sponsored terror.
[01:53:19.396 --> 01:53:21.517]  And that isn't just one issue, that's a foundation.
[01:53:22.097 --> 01:53:25.900]  They are building everything they're doing, the police state, the destruction of our sovereignty.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:33.404]  Everything these crooks do, they then say it's for your safety, for the terrorists, when they are the terrorists.
[01:53:34.033 --> 01:53:37.418]  And we're carrying the new video, 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions.
[01:53:37.939 --> 01:53:41.644]  Incredible film, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:53:41.724 --> 01:53:45.790]  Don't forget Terror Storm, now available with 66 minutes of extras on it.
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:47.901]  We're good to go.
[01:54:04.262 --> 01:54:09.527]  All of my films are available there via the Safe, Secure Video and Bookstore at InfoWars.com or again, 888-253-3139.
[01:54:09.547 --> 01:54:10.848]  You can also write to me.
[01:54:10.868 --> 01:54:12.769]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:54:24.884 --> 01:54:28.567]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Maryland and Rico, Mark, and others.
[01:54:28.607 --> 01:54:29.308]  James, welcome.
[01:54:29.608 --> 01:54:30.309]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:54:30.429 --> 01:54:35.774]  I'd like to read some scripture in light of Congressman Rangel's statements.
[01:54:36.915 --> 01:54:43.681]  This is when Israel had rejected Yahweh as ruling over them and asked for a king.
[01:54:44.041 --> 01:54:49.466]  And Yahweh granted their request and spoke to Samuel the prophet and said...
[01:54:50.686 --> 01:54:57.808]  Now listen to their voice, but you shall certainly warn them and shall make known to them the ruling of the sovereign who does reign over them.
[01:54:59.348 --> 01:55:01.889]  This is the ruling of the sovereign who does reign over you.
[01:55:02.329 --> 01:55:15.273]  He shall take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots to be his horsemen, and they shall run before his chariots and appoint commanders over his thousands and commanders over his fifties, or to plow his ground and reap his harvests.
[01:55:15.726 --> 01:55:19.729]  Or to make his weapons and equipment for his chariots.
[01:55:19.749 --> 01:55:22.692]  And that's exactly what Rangel is saying.
[01:55:23.152 --> 01:55:24.353]  It isn't just a draft.
[01:55:24.413 --> 01:55:32.700]  It's national captivity and slavery coming from the loving liberal Rangel who's going to save us.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:35.142]  And I had him on here to illustrate that.
[01:55:35.182 --> 01:55:37.303]  And there's Republican versions of the bills too.
[01:55:37.724 --> 01:55:39.385]  Domestic police state thugs.
[01:55:39.425 --> 01:55:39.885]  You heard him.
[01:55:40.106 --> 01:55:42.868]  He said we need the kids to go guard the ports.
[01:55:43.328 --> 01:55:51.650]  We're talking about a bunch of zit-faced punk video game playing kids in black uniforms with trudgeons literally beating our brains out.
[01:55:51.670 --> 01:55:58.271]  Can you imagine hordes of all the high school graduates just running around in Nazi bucket-of-puss uniforms?
[01:55:58.751 --> 01:56:00.272]  That's the future of America.
[01:56:00.292 --> 01:56:01.592]  It makes me sick.
[01:56:02.032 --> 01:56:03.973]  And I'm sorry to sound mean and vicious, folks.
[01:56:04.373 --> 01:56:09.954]  This is what we've come to, a Soviet America, and they're selling it through the phony leftist wrangle.
[01:56:10.294 --> 01:56:13.737]  Well, Congressman Rangel knows full well what he's doing and what he said.
[01:56:13.777 --> 01:56:16.439]  He knows he's arguing a false left-right paradigm.
[01:56:16.479 --> 01:56:17.560]  He knows that doesn't exist.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:20.622]  And Congressman Rangel, drift your own children!
[01:56:22.424 --> 01:56:22.884]  Exactly.
[01:56:22.924 --> 01:56:27.488]  Now, I mean, I like to be somewhat friendly, just to get Rangel on to illustrate it all.
[01:56:28.528 --> 01:56:33.312]  And we got Rangel on, but his draft, he goes, Oh, this isn't a draft.
[01:56:33.793 --> 01:56:34.513]  No, Alex.
[01:56:34.533 --> 01:56:34.994]  That's right.
[01:56:35.334 --> 01:56:36.114]  It's for everybody.
[01:56:36.134 --> 01:56:37.455]  And he goes, Yes!
[01:56:37.956 --> 01:56:39.177]  Yes!
[01:56:40.191 --> 01:56:40.591]  Liar.
[01:56:41.312 --> 01:56:41.712]  Liar.
[01:56:42.272 --> 01:56:44.053]  I tell you what... No, actually, he's not a liar.
[01:56:44.093 --> 01:56:45.354]  He came right out with it.
[01:56:45.394 --> 01:56:50.537]  Well, he's lying, saying that there's no loopholes for the rich and arguing the false left-right paradigm.
[01:56:51.518 --> 01:56:53.759]  All I can say... I'll say this in ending, Alex.
[01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:55.070]  We'd better repent.
[01:56:55.311 --> 01:56:56.651]  This country better repent.
[01:56:56.951 --> 01:56:58.272]  You're in trouble, America.
[01:56:58.612 --> 01:57:00.393]  I'm telling you, you're in trouble.
[01:57:00.433 --> 01:57:01.793]  Look at the sand on this earth.
[01:57:02.153 --> 01:57:07.615]  There's more stars in the universe than there is sand on this earth, and Yahweh spoke them into existence.
[01:57:07.656 --> 01:57:08.796]  He's coming back soon.
[01:57:08.856 --> 01:57:10.217]  You'd better repent.
[01:57:10.657 --> 01:57:11.277]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:12.646 --> 01:57:16.447]  Yeah, we should repent, but the phony churches say worship world government.
[01:57:16.487 --> 01:57:18.188]  The leader will soon be here.
[01:57:18.828 --> 01:57:20.708]  Our world leader will soon appear.
[01:57:20.768 --> 01:57:21.889]  He will be Jesus.
[01:57:22.509 --> 01:57:24.069]  We must worship him.
[01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:26.430]  He will rule us from Israel.
[01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:27.710]  You must support Israel.
[01:57:28.031 --> 01:57:32.412]  And the one leader who will soon rise, kneel before him.
[01:57:34.132 --> 01:57:38.333]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7777.
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:50.700]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:52.421]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.142 --> 01:57:54.302]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.883 --> 01:57:55.743]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.463 --> 01:57:57.344]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.364 --> 01:58:01.686]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.227 --> 01:58:06.289]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.727 --> 01:58:10.788]  Already into the third and final hour.
[01:58:10.848 --> 01:58:12.389]  We'll open the phones up in the shower.
[01:58:12.409 --> 01:58:19.812]  We have two amazing guests together, and we really won't have time to do justice to this in the 45 minutes of airtime we have each hour, but we'll try.
[01:58:20.992 --> 01:58:32.337]  They were both with the Force Research Unit, covert military intelligence unit established by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense under the British Army Special Intelligence Wing, or SIW.
[01:58:33.143 --> 01:58:42.929]  Along with the Joint Service Schools of Intelligence, originally based in Ashford and Kent, and later moved to Chicks Ends at Bedfordshire.
[01:58:43.630 --> 01:58:45.110]  And we've covered it.
[01:58:47.012 --> 01:58:55.497]  Sometimes you'd have both guys, high level in a whole branch of the IRA, really being British intelligence, and the two people not even knowing it.
[01:58:56.514 --> 01:58:59.575]  And just, this goes into false flag terror.
[01:58:59.595 --> 01:59:00.435]  It's so important.
[01:59:01.075 --> 01:59:05.436]  And both of our guests are going to use pseudonyms, though we do know both their names.
[01:59:06.116 --> 01:59:07.716]  And it's Kevin Fulton.
[01:59:08.517 --> 01:59:12.137]  And, of course, there's also Martin Ingram.
[01:59:12.697 --> 01:59:17.078]  And there have been literally hundreds of mainstream news articles written about both men in the U.S.
[01:59:17.178 --> 01:59:17.838]  and in England.
[01:59:18.259 --> 01:59:22.679]  And we're honored to have Martin Ingram and Kevin Fulton on with us today.
[01:59:22.739 --> 01:59:23.480]  Gentlemen, thank you.
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:24.960]  Good evening.
[01:59:26.484 --> 01:59:32.047]  Just so people learn to recognize each separate voice, can Martin Ingram say hi first?
[01:59:32.787 --> 01:59:33.347]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:33.627 --> 01:59:34.067]  Good evening.
[01:59:34.988 --> 01:59:36.308]  Thank you for coming on the show with us.
[01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:37.609]  You're welcome.
[01:59:38.409 --> 01:59:41.371]  Okay, that's Martin, and then Kevin, say hi.
[01:59:42.471 --> 01:59:42.871]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:42.971 --> 01:59:44.392]  Thank you very much for having me on the show.
[01:59:45.212 --> 01:59:46.613]  Yeah, I appreciate you both coming on.
[01:59:46.633 --> 01:59:50.715]  Now, were both of you what we call infiltrators?
[01:59:52.375 --> 01:59:53.896]  First off, Martin, tell us what you did.
[01:59:54.963 --> 01:59:58.204]  Well, I controlled the agents within the IRA.
[01:59:58.304 --> 02:00:06.967]  I directed people like Kevin to penetrate and infiltrate the IRA and commit crimes for and on behalf of the state.
[02:00:08.448 --> 02:00:11.369]  Commit crimes for and on behalf of the state.
[02:00:11.849 --> 02:00:13.149]  And Kevin, what did you do?
[02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:23.353]  Well, Alex, I was a member, a serving member of the British Army, and I was recruited by the Force Research Unit to actually become a terrorist on behalf of Her Majesty's government.
[02:00:25.356 --> 02:00:26.096]  Unbelievable.
[02:00:26.156 --> 02:00:27.916]  Well, you've definitely both boiled it down.
[02:00:28.017 --> 02:00:29.937]  Why are you now going public, gentlemen?
[02:00:29.957 --> 02:00:30.917]  Why are you speaking out?
[02:00:33.397 --> 02:00:38.398]  Well, from my perspective, I've been doing this since 1999.
[02:00:39.419 --> 02:00:45.240]  Basically, in a democracy, the state should not be targeting its own people.
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:48.260]  And I fundamentally feel that that is wrong.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:52.301]  And that we should learn from the mistakes of the past, the last 30 years.
[02:00:53.513 --> 02:00:59.097]  And I wouldn't like my children to suffer what many children in Northern Ireland suffered, and in other theatres.
[02:01:00.298 --> 02:01:03.901]  So that would be my motivation.
[02:01:04.421 --> 02:01:05.582]  Now, you're quite famous.
[02:01:05.622 --> 02:01:07.043]  You were known as Steak Knife.
[02:01:08.484 --> 02:01:10.345]  Well, I wrote the book Steak Knife.
[02:01:10.365 --> 02:01:12.927]  I exposed the agent who was a mass murderer.
[02:01:14.809 --> 02:01:15.169]  Exactly.
[02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:17.711]  You've been known for exposing Steak Knife, is what I should say.
[02:01:18.271 --> 02:01:18.832]  Yes, yes.
[02:01:18.992 --> 02:01:21.874]  I exposed the infamous killer.
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:31.640]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:38.026]  You know, we have a lot of laymen, people who haven't researched this, and I've read quite a few articles and books on the subject, and still I'm a complete...
[02:01:38.735 --> 02:01:39.336]  We're good to go.
[02:02:01.047 --> 02:02:08.272]  Perhaps I'll take it first, from the institution point of view, and then let Kevin take it.
[02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:27.431]  Well, we appreciate both of you men joining us and your courage.
[02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:32.654]  It takes a lot of courage to have been involved in things unsavory and then later go public and expose them.
[02:02:33.134 --> 02:02:36.876]  And obviously a lot of courage because both of you men are in physical danger.
[02:02:37.937 --> 02:02:39.337]  And that is an understatement.
[02:02:39.457 --> 02:02:40.518]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.538 --> 02:02:40.958]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:52.043]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.403 --> 02:02:54.305]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.705 --> 02:03:02.371]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.052 --> 02:03:10.077]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.497 --> 02:03:13.440]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:16.142]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.562 --> 02:03:17.363]  NSA spies.
[02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:18.570]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:45.929 --> 02:03:49.513]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:03:49.553 --> 02:03:50.054]  are located?
[02:03:50.254 --> 02:03:53.637]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:03:53.878 --> 02:03:58.582]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[02:04:46.141 --> 02:04:49.442]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[02:04:49.922 --> 02:04:52.103]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[02:04:52.603 --> 02:04:57.964]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[02:04:58.505 --> 02:05:04.406]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[02:05:45.662 --> 02:05:51.307]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.828 --> 02:06:00.533]  Joining us from undisclosed locations in the United Kingdom are two individuals that have become quite famous.
[02:06:00.994 --> 02:06:10.861]  Martin Ingram is a pseudonym used by one of the chief controlling officers who refused to go along with amazing levels of corruption and went public
[02:06:11.687 --> 02:06:16.817]  About British intelligence being involved in murders, crime, terrorism, you name it.
[02:06:17.962 --> 02:06:20.763]  And then at the same time, we're also joined by Kevin Fulton.
[02:06:21.144 --> 02:06:22.304]  That's a pseudonym as well.
[02:06:22.824 --> 02:06:24.605]  Again, this is all over the mainstream British press.
[02:06:24.625 --> 02:06:25.386]  This is vetted.
[02:06:25.426 --> 02:06:26.206]  This is admitted.
[02:06:27.026 --> 02:06:31.909]  But they're going a little bit further here today than they've gone in the past, and we're honored to have both of these gentlemen on.
[02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:37.932]  So we've got the field operative level, and then we've got the commander level with Martin Ingram.
[02:06:38.212 --> 02:06:39.352]  Martin, you take it first.
[02:06:39.973 --> 02:06:42.774]  If you can, boil it down, condense it to what you did.
[02:06:44.095 --> 02:06:51.180]  In intelligence, what you witnessed, what they told you you would be doing, and what really ended up happening, and some of the crimes that were committed that you can talk about.
[02:06:52.461 --> 02:07:01.427]  Okay, well, effectively, what Northern Ireland was, was two communities, the Protestant and the Roman Catholic, to make it very simplistic.
[02:07:01.927 --> 02:07:11.074]  What the British government did, through its various agencies, but primarily by the army and the police, was to control both factions,
[02:07:11.775 --> 02:07:12.696]  In its entirety.
[02:07:12.756 --> 02:07:20.380]  The leadership of the Republican community was infiltrated and the Protestants or the Loyalist community was infiltrated.
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:22.120]  Now, you just said the key thing there.
[02:07:22.401 --> 02:07:29.024]  Control the leadership of both entirely and literally steer and control the ongoing crises.
[02:07:29.044 --> 02:07:29.464]  Go ahead.
[02:07:30.265 --> 02:07:33.386]  Well, that is fundamental to achieving your objective.
[02:07:34.087 --> 02:07:40.250]  And effectively what they did for 30 years was to have them fight each other
[02:07:40.996 --> 02:07:52.201]  And make it look to the world that the British government was the honest arbitrator and the honest party who was basically being caught up in the middle and trying to do its best.
[02:07:52.441 --> 02:08:03.105]  And from what I've taken away from what other agents in the record shows and the inquiries show is, in truth, they were there actually trying to stir it up as a pretext to continue control over the region.
[02:08:03.165 --> 02:08:03.885]  Is that accurate?
[02:08:04.766 --> 02:08:06.627]  Yeah, they didn't stir it.
[02:08:06.727 --> 02:08:07.707]  They generated it.
[02:08:08.294 --> 02:08:17.241]  Without the British government's involvement and action by various agencies, there wouldn't have been the prolonged conflict.
[02:08:17.401 --> 02:08:19.122]  So it's worse than what I said.
[02:08:19.562 --> 02:08:24.246]  I mean, to repeat what you just said, they didn't stir it, they generated it.
[02:08:24.926 --> 02:08:25.667]  Absolutely.
[02:08:25.707 --> 02:08:28.949]  They directed it.
[02:08:31.291 --> 02:08:36.515]  If your imagination couldn't run to the levels of ingenuity which was taken to
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:38.340]  To run these sort of people.
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:48.282]  To give you an example, the man known as Stake Knife, Mr. Alfredo Scappaticci, was run for over 30 years in the capacity of the head of the Internal Security Unit.
[02:08:48.642 --> 02:08:51.963]  And that is, he killed people fallen on behalf of the state.
[02:08:52.483 --> 02:09:06.646]  Now, many of the people that he killed were people who were genuinely Republicans or people who were committed to the fight, but weren't following the doctrine which was being set by Her Majesty's Government.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.882]  In other words, if it didn't fit in Her Majesty's government strategy, then you were disposed of.
[02:09:13.903 --> 02:09:21.087]  And for listeners who just joined us, describe your role, sir, inside of this whole operation.
[02:09:22.267 --> 02:09:35.534]  Well, myself, we control agents like Freddy Scappaticci and others who were tasked to commit crimes, to gather intelligence,
[02:09:36.637 --> 02:09:43.902]  Which would, in theory, allow the commanders to exploit intelligence in a timely fashion to save life.
[02:09:44.322 --> 02:09:46.844]  That's what I joined the service for, which was to save life.
[02:09:48.225 --> 02:10:00.173]  And what actually happened was that we took life, and it was very arbitrary inasmuch as it wasn't very fair, let me put it that way.
[02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:05.016]  And it didn't follow what I would expect in a normal democracy.
[02:10:06.437 --> 02:10:23.222]  Well, from my research, obviously not being on the inside like both of you gentlemen were, it was just really to keep the crises going and to make sure that it never really became a serious political discussion and to keep the two sides fighting with each other as a pretext to keep British control in Northern Ireland.
[02:10:24.043 --> 02:10:26.243]  And that is exactly what's happened today, isn't it?
[02:10:26.283 --> 02:10:31.885]  Because, you know, effectively the Republican movement today has been neutered.
[02:10:31.925 --> 02:10:34.746]  Well, not been neutered, it's been defeated in its entirety.
[02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:49.054]  And from a loyalist point of view, criminality still goes on, but the Good Friday Agreement unbelievably respects the right of the United Kingdom to administer rule in the North.
[02:10:49.514 --> 02:10:57.556]  It also makes sure that the Republic of Ireland renounces its territorial claim to the North of Ireland.
[02:10:57.596 --> 02:11:01.037]  Have the Irish and British people started to see through this, sir?
[02:11:02.447 --> 02:11:12.995]  I'd say the Northern Irish community prior to 1999 were totally at a loss to explain what had gone on in the past.
[02:11:13.596 --> 02:11:30.889]  Since 1999, when people like myself and Kevin Fulton and a few others and a number of very, very good journalists like Greg Harkin and Liam Clarke and a few other people who have exposed certain aspects of this story, the public today
[02:11:31.971 --> 02:11:33.317]  Absolutely 100% believers.
[02:11:33.397 --> 02:11:33.518]  And...
[02:11:35.672 --> 02:11:40.354]  Which is something that I believe that you're trying to convince the American public in respect to 9-11.
[02:11:40.755 --> 02:11:41.495]  Oh, exactly.
[02:11:41.555 --> 02:11:49.599]  In fact, just out of the gates, we know that our government has Operation Northwoods, an official plan to stage 9-11-style attacks.
[02:11:49.639 --> 02:11:51.400]  We know Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:57.764]  Totally declassified that our government staged attacks in 1953 against Iran to blame it on their government.
[02:11:58.144 --> 02:12:01.125]  So, yes, sir, we believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:12:01.145 --> 02:12:02.306]  You want to give us your take on that?
[02:12:03.587 --> 02:12:07.991]  Well, I have met with David Shaler and I have discussed, so I'll make that clear.
[02:12:08.411 --> 02:12:15.577]  And I have watched some of the video footage of the attacks.
[02:12:15.597 --> 02:12:20.721]  I would caution, from my perspective, that I don't know enough about it.
[02:12:20.741 --> 02:12:29.749]  But what I would say is there are very many questions which would require to be answered in a very explicit and detailed way.
[02:12:29.969 --> 02:12:31.310]  So you do smell a rat then?
[02:12:32.234 --> 02:12:40.363]  Yeah, there are certain aspects of this that I think they don't deserve, but I would demand answers to them.
[02:12:40.424 --> 02:12:51.376]  If I had lost a loved one in that incident, then I would be absolutely, fundamentally in favour of a, we call it a public inquiry.
[02:12:51.995 --> 02:12:54.196]  But an open inquiry into all that.
[02:12:54.256 --> 02:12:54.436]  Sure.
[02:12:54.456 --> 02:12:55.457]  We know there's been a cover-up.
[02:12:55.637 --> 02:12:57.237]  The first step would be a real investigation.
[02:12:57.538 --> 02:13:07.442]  We're talking to one of the commanders from the Force Research Unit, covered military intelligence unit, established running operations in Northern Ireland and, of course, in areas of England.
[02:13:09.242 --> 02:13:13.003]  Gentlemen, how far can you go in saying what your role was?
[02:13:13.044 --> 02:13:20.486]  Well, before we do that, and I also want to give Kevin a chance to pop in here and say some things here in just a moment, but I'll continue with Martin Ingram.
[02:13:20.906 --> 02:13:26.587]  Martin, what did you see in 99, or what was the string of things you witnessed that made you finally go public?
[02:13:28.208 --> 02:13:34.449]  Well, in essence, what it is is that we are being fed a lie.
[02:13:37.043 --> 02:13:45.404]  And I dislike the public being lied to and ultimately the victims deserve to be told the truth.
[02:13:45.705 --> 02:13:53.506]  We're in a period now in Northern Ireland where there isn't going to be a conflict, another conflict, as this generation has been defeated.
[02:13:53.966 --> 02:14:05.668]  So it's incumbent upon the government and there has been three governments principally during this conflict who shut all their hands up and accept
[02:14:06.525 --> 02:14:19.475]  The blame and the responsibility and also people like myself also have to accept responsibility at the coalface because we all have the right to say no.
[02:14:20.296 --> 02:14:26.801]  I didn't say no but, you know, clearly what we did was wrong.
[02:14:28.522 --> 02:14:31.905]  99% of our operations I have no problem with and I would defend.
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:34.521]  But the 1%... Let's get into that 1%.
[02:14:34.661 --> 02:14:40.504]  I mean, I've got all the articles here in front of me, but it's better to hear it directly from the people who witnessed it.
[02:14:41.205 --> 02:14:43.426]  What type of criminal activities are we talking about?
[02:14:44.126 --> 02:14:44.667]  Mass murder.
[02:14:47.688 --> 02:14:50.150]  Would you like to give us an example of one of the famous cases?
[02:14:50.230 --> 02:14:53.552]  Or if Kevin would like to pop in, give us an example of anything he witnessed?
[02:14:54.372 --> 02:14:59.175]  Well, let me give you an example of, say, the human bomb, the strategy of...
[02:15:00.479 --> 02:15:03.441]  ...of using a human being as a proxy bomb.
[02:15:03.902 --> 02:15:11.607]  I suppose very similar to a suicide bomb in it, but where you scratch or you contain an individual.
[02:15:11.647 --> 02:15:19.472]  Kevin is ideally placed to give you an insight into that because he was involved in that type of an operation.
[02:15:20.993 --> 02:15:21.334]  Yes, sir.
[02:15:21.354 --> 02:15:28.879]  Please tell us, Kevin Fulton, give us just kind of a bird's eye view of what Martin's talking about.
[02:15:29.781 --> 02:15:38.343]  Well, since I released the book actually just there in June, and since June the police have now started a criminal investigation into my activities.
[02:15:39.203 --> 02:15:58.728]  So a lot of the stuff I can't go into in exact detail, but what I can say is IRA operations, there were a number of agents involved in operations, and these people were agents for the British state in the human bomb attacks, which killed soldiers, innocent civilians, also landmine attacks,
[02:15:59.611 --> 02:16:05.833]  I mean, listen, the best way to put it to your listeners is, I was a soldier recruited to go into the ILA.
[02:16:05.913 --> 02:16:09.654]  Basically, in my capacity as a British agent, I became a terrorist.
[02:16:10.374 --> 02:16:13.035]  Now, you can't pretend to be a terrorist.
[02:16:13.955 --> 02:16:17.516]  You know, I had to be able to do the same thing as the man next to me was doing.
[02:16:18.297 --> 02:16:21.758]  I'm not going to go into specifics, but I mean, just listen to what I'm saying.
[02:16:21.778 --> 02:16:24.358]  You know, that's exactly what it is.
[02:16:24.378 --> 02:16:29.160]  I mean, I was in operations and they were basically frustrated
[02:16:29.918 --> 02:16:30.859]  No target turned up.
[02:16:31.299 --> 02:16:34.521]  Sometimes, operations have got, things didn't go to plan.
[02:16:36.402 --> 02:16:38.242]  And I think you should be able to read into that again.
[02:16:38.263 --> 02:16:43.305]  I mean, this interview that I'm doing now will be used against me by the British authorities.
[02:16:44.726 --> 02:16:47.928]  Well, I would imagine they're pretty upset that you're going public right now, aren't they?
[02:16:48.068 --> 02:16:50.529]  Well, the thing is, I had no other choice.
[02:16:50.589 --> 02:16:51.910]  They tried to have me killed.
[02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:55.872]  I work for Internal Security for the IRA as well, along with Mr. Scabatici.
[02:16:56.721 --> 02:17:01.225]  I mean, my own people in the government, someone took the decision to have me murdered.
[02:17:01.285 --> 02:17:09.051]  I had outlived my use on this, and the best way to look at it now is, I see it now since I'm away from it, they had to tie up loose ends.
[02:17:10.112 --> 02:17:14.616]  Now, I had friends, I still have friends in the intelligence community, who took me off.
[02:17:15.517 --> 02:17:16.457]  They saved my life.
[02:17:17.298 --> 02:17:18.279]  Well, stay there.
[02:17:18.319 --> 02:17:18.919]  We've got a break.
[02:17:18.959 --> 02:17:21.602]  When we come back, I want to hear about how your life's in danger.
[02:17:22.502 --> 02:17:22.983]  And, uh...
[02:17:24.170 --> 02:17:28.713]  Then I can go over a few of the cases that were admitted and now public.
[02:17:28.733 --> 02:17:33.415]  But we're talking about state-sponsored terror, talking about the government staging attacks, blaming it on enemies.
[02:17:33.435 --> 02:17:43.661]  We're talking about the government literally leading the IRA, leading the Orange, leading both sides, leading them into conflict as a pretext to keep the military in place in Northern Ireland.
[02:17:44.081 --> 02:17:44.762]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.901 --> 02:17:50.385]  As snow falls on the majestic Rocky Mountains, it eventually melts.
[02:17:50.586 --> 02:17:56.452]  The water east of the Continental Divide travels downhill over 1600 miles before reaching the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:17:56.633 --> 02:17:58.655]  On the western side, water travels downhill
[02:18:03.302 --> 02:18:03.702]  We're good to go.
[02:18:22.432 --> 02:18:24.974]  Yeah, they can purify that downward flowing water.
[02:18:25.094 --> 02:18:32.038]  Berkey Purification Systems get rid of the unhealthy stuff in your water while leaving the healthy beneficial materials that your body needs.
[02:18:32.179 --> 02:18:35.621]  For more information on the powerful Berkey Purifiers, call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:46.229 --> 02:18:47.450]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[02:18:47.490 --> 02:18:49.831]  Today is September 21st, 2006.
[02:18:50.131 --> 02:18:55.794]  Gold opened at $579.50 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $610.79.
[02:18:56.534 --> 02:18:59.835]  Again, that's $610.79 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[02:19:00.236 --> 02:19:07.339]  With a slow economy, real estate prices dropping, the war on terrorism, the economic climate in the United States is questionable.
[02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:07.979]  U.S.
[02:19:08.019 --> 02:19:11.301]  citizens work a third of their life just to cover their tax liabilities.
[02:19:11.821 --> 02:19:12.562]  We're good to go.
[02:19:28.716 --> 02:19:30.577]  Call today for a free copy, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.617 --> 02:19:37.278]  Our government may be bound to repeat, so arm yourself with knowledge, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.318 --> 02:19:37.498]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.518 --> 02:19:42.359]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:19:57.898 --> 02:20:07.560]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:15.101]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:20:16.021 --> 02:20:24.823]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[02:20:25.464 --> 02:20:27.025]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.045 --> 02:20:27.286]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.306 --> 02:20:27.466]  Call now.
[02:20:27.486 --> 02:20:32.850]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:46.593 --> 02:20:49.094]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:20:49.194 --> 02:20:51.575]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:20:51.635 --> 02:20:57.818]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:20:59.299 --> 02:21:01.580]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.782]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:21:06.342 --> 02:21:10.464]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:21:11.045 --> 02:21:14.006]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:21:14.989 --> 02:21:17.911]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:21:18.651 --> 02:21:24.395]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:21:24.455 --> 02:21:28.457]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:21:29.218 --> 02:21:32.560]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:35.561]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:21:36.522 --> 02:21:38.803]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:21:38.884 --> 02:21:43.046]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[02:21:43.406 --> 02:21:44.367]  And ask for George.
[02:21:47.998 --> 02:21:58.887]  During the break I was looking at martiningram.blogspot.com and other websites that have photos and documents up there from Kevin Fulton and Martin Ingram.
[02:21:59.567 --> 02:22:04.712]  Pictures of British intelligence officers that posed as the leaders of groups like Sinn Fein.
[02:22:06.133 --> 02:22:07.594]  Just amazing stuff.
[02:22:07.614 --> 02:22:09.195]  The photos we're looking at, gentlemen...
[02:22:10.689 --> 02:22:16.251]  Can you describe some of the images that I've been looking at that we've got linked to up on InfoWars.com?
[02:22:16.831 --> 02:22:21.813]  Kevin, and can you relay to us how much danger you guys are in for going public?
[02:22:23.414 --> 02:22:24.874]  Do you want me to go first, Alex?
[02:22:26.014 --> 02:22:26.335]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:26.355 --> 02:22:26.675]  Please.
[02:22:27.335 --> 02:22:29.096]  I'm not near my computer.
[02:22:29.376 --> 02:22:33.577]  Some of the photographs up there, there may be some of the dead agents lying at the side of the road.
[02:22:35.298 --> 02:22:36.658]  I don't know why you have linked to those.
[02:22:36.698 --> 02:22:38.859]  Those were three guys digging in stars and burns.
[02:22:39.434 --> 02:22:40.675]  These were three British agents.
[02:22:41.375 --> 02:22:54.101]  They had warned their handlers that they were compromised, they needed to be pulled out, and someone within the Force Research Unit, Colonel Kerr, he took the decision, let them go, let them die.
[02:22:54.822 --> 02:23:02.926]  Now, they were abducted by the Ireland Internal Security Unit, and now, I wasn't involved in that operation, but
[02:23:05.138 --> 02:23:11.443]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:23:11.503 --> 02:23:15.846]  We have people who are British intelligence heading up IRA internal security.
[02:23:16.687 --> 02:23:17.528]  That's a key point.
[02:23:17.948 --> 02:23:24.954]  I mean, we're talking about leadership on both sides, the groups not just being infiltrated, but being led by British intel.
[02:23:25.014 --> 02:23:25.975]  Break that down for us.
[02:23:27.076 --> 02:23:30.338]  Well, the thing is, I was involved in the internal security unit.
[02:23:30.398 --> 02:23:31.039]  I was a driver.
[02:23:31.059 --> 02:23:32.120]  Now,
[02:23:32.796 --> 02:23:34.937]  I mean, everything I learned went back to my handlers.
[02:23:35.777 --> 02:23:40.899]  Now, I didn't know that Agent Steakknife, who was there at present as well, was also an agent.
[02:23:41.759 --> 02:23:43.900]  You know, no one knows what the man next to him is.
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.061]  I treated everybody as my enemy.
[02:23:46.941 --> 02:23:51.243]  So basically, people's lives could have been saved and weren't.
[02:23:52.243 --> 02:23:53.784]  That's exactly just what it is.
[02:23:53.804 --> 02:23:55.824]  They picked and chose who they wanted to die.
[02:23:56.725 --> 02:23:57.065]  Which was...
[02:23:58.186 --> 02:23:58.946]  Sounds terrible.
[02:23:59.226 --> 02:24:03.087]  In intelligence circles, it's a logical thing to do when you conduct black operations.
[02:24:03.927 --> 02:24:07.488]  You know, that is the way I was set up in another operation.
[02:24:07.548 --> 02:24:13.469]  I didn't even see it coming until someone friendly in the service actually warned me not to go back.
[02:24:14.629 --> 02:24:17.510]  And that's when I had to go running and that's when I exposed everything.
[02:24:18.530 --> 02:24:24.832]  So the government asked you, recruited you out of the army to go do all of this and then tried to just cut you loose?
[02:24:25.832 --> 02:24:26.532]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:24:27.904 --> 02:24:32.865]  I mean, my government, we even got to the stage of... I helped develop triggers for bombs.
[02:24:32.885 --> 02:24:35.346]  I helped develop bombs for the IRA.
[02:24:35.766 --> 02:24:44.888]  I mean, at one time, because the Army had jamming devices to stop radio signals, I mean, this is used everywhere, the IRA started to work on a flash unit.
[02:24:45.688 --> 02:24:50.269]  Now, I was actually asked to go to New York to buy some of these units in New York.
[02:24:51.389 --> 02:24:55.010]  Now, my MI5 military handlers and one special branch officer...
[02:24:55.856 --> 02:24:59.858]  Arranged, you know, for safe passage for me to go to New York, which I did.
[02:25:00.718 --> 02:25:04.880]  But when I met there, there was FBI and Secret Service people there with my handlers.
[02:25:05.741 --> 02:25:10.803]  You know, I met up with another bomb maker who was on the run from the provisional IRA.
[02:25:10.843 --> 02:25:12.344]  He was living in New York illegally.
[02:25:13.644 --> 02:25:22.989]  They had lost him and I basically met up with him for dinner and, you know, the FBI people picked him up later on to try to recruit him as an agent.
[02:25:23.609 --> 02:25:25.130]  I mean, this is another thing that's
[02:25:26.666 --> 02:25:27.626]  It makes sense to me now.
[02:25:27.666 --> 02:25:29.607]  At the time, you know, I was in the middle of things.
[02:25:29.727 --> 02:25:30.887]  I wasn't seeing fairly.
[02:25:31.448 --> 02:25:33.288]  And I was a willing tool of the government.
[02:25:35.049 --> 02:25:43.931]  You know, I would target people who were killing people as well, and I would tell my handlers, thinking that these people would be arrested on a job, on an operation.
[02:25:43.971 --> 02:25:47.613]  It did happen sometimes, but other times, these people were recruited.
[02:25:47.633 --> 02:25:54.795]  So instead of locking these people up, they actually recruited real terrorists and made them their agents.
[02:25:54.815 --> 02:25:55.215]  You know, it's
[02:25:56.575 --> 02:26:00.737]  Sure, that's the type of people the government wants, and then you're a real live agent.
[02:26:00.757 --> 02:26:02.437]  You're just a nobody to them.
[02:26:02.457 --> 02:26:06.999]  They try to cut loose later, and then you've got government out sponsoring terror.
[02:26:07.679 --> 02:26:16.123]  How many cases were you aware of, both of you gentlemen, where the government cooked the bomb or trained the driver or let the attack go forward for political gain?
[02:26:16.143 --> 02:26:22.445]  One that springs to mind straight away, I mean, I wasn't involved with the bomb that went off in Omaha.
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:36.348]  But just before that bomb, and a number of occasions before that, I'd met the same guy, the man here, the ombudsman called him, and he was making bombs, so I would tell my handler, and sure enough, within two or three days, the bomb would go off locally.
[02:26:36.368 --> 02:26:45.314]  Three days before the bomb went off in Oma, I met this guy again, just about ten past twelve after midnight, and he was mixing the bomb.
[02:26:45.374 --> 02:26:47.775]  I mean, this guy is an agent as well.
[02:26:47.795 --> 02:26:48.756]  He was my...
[02:26:49.611 --> 02:26:52.532]  He was my boss in the IRA.
[02:26:52.732 --> 02:26:59.173]  So your boss in the IRA is a government agent, too, and he's making the bomb that they go, and then, of course, the Omaha bomb killed a bunch of people.
[02:26:59.893 --> 02:27:02.033]  The Omaha bomb killed 30 people, yeah.
[02:27:02.073 --> 02:27:03.914]  Say that number again for folks that missed it.
[02:27:05.574 --> 02:27:06.874]  Pardon?
[02:27:07.434 --> 02:27:07.955]  30 people.
[02:27:07.995 --> 02:27:08.775]  Yeah, 30 people.
[02:27:09.775 --> 02:27:09.995]  Yeah.
[02:27:10.135 --> 02:27:10.775]  Hey, but don't worry.
[02:27:10.795 --> 02:27:15.036]  I get to put up some more cameras, take some more freedoms, put some more troops on the streets.
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:16.961]  Learn to worship the government?
[02:27:17.181 --> 02:27:19.503]  Okay, this was a short segment, gentlemen.
[02:27:19.844 --> 02:27:20.844]  Long segment coming up.
[02:27:20.864 --> 02:27:21.825]  Plenty of time to talk.
[02:27:22.185 --> 02:27:23.787]  I'd like you both to just have a free-for-all.
[02:27:23.847 --> 02:27:33.975]  Go back and forth and let's get it all out there and hopefully this can stop more of this activity in the future because disclosing this makes the government suspend their actions.
[02:27:36.137 --> 02:27:37.078]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.538 --> 02:27:39.180]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:42.743]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:52.112]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:52.332 --> 02:27:54.093]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:54.353 --> 02:28:00.657]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:28:00.937 --> 02:28:07.060]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:07.300 --> 02:28:09.161]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument
[02:28:09.581 --> 02:28:20.028]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:28:20.188 --> 02:28:23.731]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:28:24.031 --> 02:28:27.733]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:28:27.914 --> 02:28:30.455]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:28:30.595 --> 02:28:31.596]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:31.596 --> 02:28:31.736]  1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[02:28:45.845 --> 02:28:49.027]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:28:49.067 --> 02:28:53.110]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:55.792]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:28:55.852 --> 02:28:58.193]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:28:58.374 --> 02:29:06.799]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:29:06.879 --> 02:29:08.200]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:12.363]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:29:12.743 --> 02:29:26.154]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[02:29:26.374 --> 02:29:32.739]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[02:29:47.834 --> 02:29:48.515]  Hey, Bill.
[02:29:48.835 --> 02:29:49.916]  I'm buying lunch today.
[02:29:50.256 --> 02:29:51.077]  And check this out.
[02:29:51.397 --> 02:29:52.298]  I bought a new car.
[02:29:52.378 --> 02:29:53.039]  Wow, John.
[02:29:53.099 --> 02:29:57.623]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[02:29:58.183 --> 02:30:02.307]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[02:30:02.647 --> 02:30:07.551]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:07.972 --> 02:30:10.434]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:10.734 --> 02:30:14.077]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[02:30:14.317 --> 02:30:15.218]  Whoa, that's awesome.
[02:30:15.558 --> 02:30:17.960]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:20.562]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[02:30:20.682 --> 02:30:21.342]  It's incredible.
[02:30:21.702 --> 02:30:29.188]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[02:30:29.508 --> 02:30:34.432]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:35.052 --> 02:30:35.752]  Check, please.
[02:30:36.213 --> 02:30:37.093]  I got this one, Bill.
[02:30:37.494 --> 02:30:38.174]  Sure, John.
[02:30:38.314 --> 02:30:42.918]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:43.058 --> 02:30:43.318]  Deal.
[02:30:46.452 --> 02:30:52.076]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.618 --> 02:31:05.585]  When Martin Ingram, and now Kevin Fulton and many others, started going public in the late 1990s, you notice that IRA bombings just suddenly went away.
[02:31:07.546 --> 02:31:12.590]  You notice that the pretext for the occupation of Northern Ireland suddenly ended.
[02:31:14.913 --> 02:31:16.974]  This is why disclosure is so important.
[02:31:18.014 --> 02:31:31.599]  Because when you've got both sides led and controlled, and in the cases of where low-level IRA who weren't government agents, who really were terrorists, you know, getting kneecapped, getting beat up, getting killed because they refuse to go out and kill people.
[02:31:32.259 --> 02:31:34.920]  Imagine British agents, get out there and kill!
[02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:35.860]  Kill!
[02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:38.361]  And they think it's their IRA commanders.
[02:31:40.601 --> 02:31:41.982]  It's just so sick.
[02:31:43.044 --> 02:31:46.125]  And it's the same thing we've seen in this country, Israel, everywhere.
[02:31:47.906 --> 02:31:49.026]  It's horrible.
[02:31:49.667 --> 02:31:50.927]  And it's order out of chaos.
[02:31:50.947 --> 02:31:52.168]  That's what we're talking about here.
[02:31:52.568 --> 02:32:04.653]  Going back to Kevin Fulton and, of course, Martin Ingram, just so people know who Martin is, Martin Ingram is the pseudonym for the ex-British Army soldier who served in the Intelligence Corps and Force Research Unit.
[02:32:05.973 --> 02:32:11.936]  And he has really exposed the British Army, its operations in Northern Ireland via the Force Research Unit and against...
[02:32:13.028 --> 02:32:17.589]  Features in the Provisional Irish Republican Army, or PIRA.
[02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:21.390]  And we're going to just leave it right there.
[02:32:21.950 --> 02:32:27.032]  I've got the encyclopedia here, and it's got more on his name and information, but we're not going to give you his name here on air today.
[02:32:27.752 --> 02:32:32.793]  We do have links to both these gentlemen's websites, their blogs, where you can learn more about what they're saying and doing.
[02:32:33.773 --> 02:32:36.014]  They have really stopped a lot of further killing.
[02:32:36.994 --> 02:32:39.535]  Gentlemen, and either one of you can take this first.
[02:32:40.661 --> 02:32:43.742]  Is my outside analysis and view of this correct?
[02:32:44.203 --> 02:33:02.610]  That as soon as the fact that British intelligence was running the operations came out, that we saw an almost end or a major drop-off down to almost nothing of terrorist attacks in Northern Ireland and England, supposedly from the IRA?
[02:33:04.831 --> 02:33:06.172]  Can I say that one first, Kevin?
[02:33:06.492 --> 02:33:06.712]  Sure.
[02:33:06.772 --> 02:33:07.492]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:33:08.193 --> 02:33:08.913]  Okay, well...
[02:33:09.798 --> 02:33:13.520]  Yes, a little bit too simplistic, Alex, and I'll explain why.
[02:33:15.681 --> 02:33:19.202]  Prior to 99, the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 98.
[02:33:19.302 --> 02:33:28.046]  Effectively, the war in the North was actually finished by the very early 90s, the 92 to 96 period.
[02:33:28.426 --> 02:33:32.868]  We saw the odd mainland bombing at Docklands in London and Canary Wharf.
[02:33:33.689 --> 02:33:36.410]  They were again committed and directed by agents.
[02:33:37.009 --> 02:33:39.871]  But what effectively happened... Hold on, hold on.
[02:33:40.091 --> 02:33:47.256]  The bombing that you just mentioned at Canary Wharf, carried out by British agents.
[02:33:48.276 --> 02:33:54.000]  Yeah, and also the Manchester bombing, and the police in Manchester were actually stopped.
[02:33:54.020 --> 02:34:00.224]  They actually had forensic evidence against the bombers, and very controversially have been...
[02:34:01.046 --> 02:34:08.751]  Stopped, politically stopped, from mounting a prosecution against the bombers, who, again, were agents of the state.
[02:34:09.572 --> 02:34:24.181]  So, you know, you could argue why that bombing was carried out, but, you know, at the end of the day, it was carried out, and the state has now decided that it does not want to prosecute those involved.
[02:34:24.895 --> 02:34:25.395]  Primarily.
[02:34:25.536 --> 02:34:26.937]  So why did this come out then?
[02:34:26.977 --> 02:34:32.101]  The operations were kind of ending and they wanted to tie up loose ends and you guys didn't feel like getting killed?
[02:34:33.762 --> 02:34:35.043]  Not so much getting killed.
[02:34:35.203 --> 02:34:51.075]  No, it came about because for one thing we've got the internet, so the control of information is very difficult because what I would say, and it is very crucial to the overall conflict,
[02:34:51.465 --> 02:34:54.588]  Was that the British government had control over the media.
[02:34:55.349 --> 02:35:00.873]  And just may I pick up on the point that Kevin raised before the break about Ulmer?
[02:35:01.534 --> 02:35:03.696]  Ulmer bombing, yeah.
[02:35:04.257 --> 02:35:05.017]  The Ulmer bombing.
[02:35:05.317 --> 02:35:15.807]  Well, the British government decided that it would leak certain information to the BBC, the British Broadcasting Corporation, which has a phenomenal record.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.421]  Sort of reputation.
[02:35:18.441 --> 02:35:21.583]  Total government front going back to George Orwell's day.
[02:35:22.263 --> 02:35:22.824]  Absolutely.
[02:35:22.884 --> 02:35:29.507]  Now, what they did effectively, they have a very high-profile program called Panorama.
[02:35:30.068 --> 02:35:34.770]  You have a similar sort of program in the States, and it's the number one flagship.
[02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:36.431]  It's like 60 Minutes.
[02:35:36.871 --> 02:35:38.352]  It's exactly like 60 Minutes.
[02:35:38.852 --> 02:35:43.955]  And they have their number one reporter, a gentleman who I know very well, called John Ware.
[02:35:44.396 --> 02:35:45.036]  Now, John Ware...
[02:35:45.589 --> 02:35:47.830]  His integrity is beyond reproach.
[02:35:48.471 --> 02:36:00.156]  Basically, he was fed information, and as Kevin outlined, the bomb maker and the OMA bombing, he calls him Man A. I will call him by his real name, Patrick Joseph Mooch Blair.
[02:36:00.957 --> 02:36:08.561]  And he, basically, his telephone was used within 30 seconds of the bombing going off.
[02:36:08.601 --> 02:36:13.063]  The location where it went off, his phone was used within 30 seconds.
[02:36:13.783 --> 02:36:26.107]  And they deliberately did not tell the journalists involved in the Panorama program because they wanted to keep the attention away from the agent who both committed the bomb and also constructed the bomb.
[02:36:26.747 --> 02:36:37.070]  Now, the journalist was given this information subsequently and he was mystified as to why he was not fed that information.
[02:36:37.490 --> 02:36:39.351]  Now, what it does go to show is that
[02:36:39.830 --> 02:36:43.552]  The government wants total control over the media.
[02:36:43.832 --> 02:36:45.753]  And I would imagine that's the same in the States.
[02:36:46.633 --> 02:36:53.716]  But it is becoming more and more difficult to control because the advent of the Internet has made it almost impossible.
[02:36:53.956 --> 02:36:55.217]  I myself have a blog.
[02:36:55.677 --> 02:36:56.657]  You have a blog.
[02:36:57.117 --> 02:36:59.618]  Kevin has a means of getting information out.
[02:36:59.638 --> 02:37:07.722]  So the old ways of dealing with the situation, frankly, have had to go with the Cold War.
[02:37:07.822 --> 02:37:08.162]  It's gone.
[02:37:08.567 --> 02:37:14.029]  And they're having to design and devise different ways of maintaining that control.
[02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:31.817]  Okay, well, at the risk of being too simplistic again, and you can correct me and enlighten me here, and I also want to get Kevin Fulton's response to all that's been said here and any other caveats or addendums or points he thinks are salient and central for the people to get a good panoramic view, pun intended.
[02:37:32.598 --> 02:37:32.718]  Yes.
[02:37:34.528 --> 02:37:34.748]  I think.
[02:37:49.448 --> 02:38:06.401]  The most common is the provocateur, where the terrorists are led by government agents, handled by government agents, given weapons by government agents, and then they go out and carry out attacks, and the agents are kept safe, and then even their main terrorists are kept safe, and some normally mentally retarded patsy is sent down the river.
[02:38:08.897 --> 02:38:17.980]  The majority of bombings in England in the last 30, 40 years, which of the three type attacks are the most common?
[02:38:18.881 --> 02:38:20.361]  I mean, just give me your dead reckoning.
[02:38:20.401 --> 02:38:26.544]  Which percentage are real terror attacks, what percentage are provocateurs, and what percentage are total government?
[02:38:28.004 --> 02:38:35.707]  Well, just to give you an overview of that situation, the IRA was armed by the Libyans,
[02:38:36.411 --> 02:38:41.533]  And the Protestants were armed by a major shipment from South Africa.
[02:38:41.893 --> 02:38:53.557]  Now, both shipments, that is the IRA's Libyan one and the Protestants from South Africa, were both controlled and allowed to proceed by agents.
[02:38:54.818 --> 02:38:57.379]  They were directly involved.
[02:38:57.419 --> 02:38:58.979]  So it's a provocateur action, okay.
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:38:59.600]  Absolutely.
[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:05.602]  Now, to answer your question about the majority of high-profile attacks on the mainland,
[02:39:06.597 --> 02:39:24.585]  A large proportion, I wouldn't lie to put a percentage, but certainly well over 60% or 70% would have involved the use of agents and would certainly have been preventable if you didn't have the long-term interest.
[02:39:25.446 --> 02:39:32.869]  But of that 60%, 70%, what percentage of those are pure government ops versus provocateur or shepherded?
[02:39:33.755 --> 02:39:37.596]  Well, I would always say that they were government ops, because ultimately a lot of... I agree.
[02:39:37.656 --> 02:39:38.576]  No, no, certainly I agree.
[02:39:38.596 --> 02:39:40.077]  I was trying to separate the two.
[02:39:40.717 --> 02:39:41.057]  Absolutely.
[02:39:41.217 --> 02:39:42.857]  Well, it's very difficult.
[02:39:43.018 --> 02:39:49.479]  I don't think you should separate the two, because ultimately the government... Well, the reason I do is the public gets confused.
[02:39:49.539 --> 02:39:51.400]  They go, but there's a real terrorist.
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:57.562]  Okay, well, there's agents, but they just can't understand it, so I try to... And I'm not patronizing.
[02:39:57.602 --> 02:39:59.682]  I mean, most of my audience is smarter than I am.
[02:39:59.722 --> 02:40:02.723]  I'm trying to let people see how this happens.
[02:40:04.099 --> 02:40:05.580]  Yeah, I accept what you're saying.
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:10.124]  It's just that, you know, from an insider's point of view, there is very little difference.
[02:40:10.204 --> 02:40:12.165]  You could get a cigarette paper between the two.
[02:40:12.345 --> 02:40:13.446]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:40:13.686 --> 02:40:15.027]  Listen, I totally agree.
[02:40:15.107 --> 02:40:16.268]  And you guys are the experts.
[02:40:16.489 --> 02:40:17.469]  You've been quiet, Kevin.
[02:40:17.489 --> 02:40:18.270]  You've got the floor.
[02:40:18.310 --> 02:40:19.371]  Give us your take on everything.
[02:40:19.911 --> 02:40:23.334]  Well, just to explain it there, I mean, there's a lot of operations I went on.
[02:40:23.774 --> 02:40:25.135]  And I knew I was an agent.
[02:40:25.195 --> 02:40:26.496]  I didn't know the other people with me.
[02:40:27.277 --> 02:40:29.438]  And my handlers would know what operation was coming up.
[02:40:29.599 --> 02:40:30.920]  And we did save lives.
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:32.701]  And as I said before, sometimes...
[02:40:33.168 --> 02:40:34.229]  The plan didn't go to plan.
[02:40:35.109 --> 02:40:43.454]  Now, I've learned since coming away from those things, a lot of the other people who were planning these jobs have also now turned out to be agents as well.
[02:40:44.515 --> 02:40:46.296]  So, I mean, there's a very fine line.
[02:40:46.336 --> 02:40:51.139]  I think most operations were basically a duty.
[02:40:51.239 --> 02:40:52.719]  Our young provocateurs were there.
[02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:53.800]  They were helping out.
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:55.181]  We were allowed to go ahead with things.
[02:40:56.262 --> 02:40:58.703]  You know, people lost lives.
[02:40:59.263 --> 02:41:00.204]  A lot of people were saved.
[02:41:01.016 --> 02:41:02.437]  I don't think you can distinguish.
[02:41:02.618 --> 02:41:07.202]  When you're saying that government ops are proper terrorists, this is always proper terrorists.
[02:41:07.723 --> 02:41:09.464]  But always watch the man next beside him.
[02:41:09.504 --> 02:41:10.906]  There's always an agent in somewhere.
[02:41:12.147 --> 02:41:13.608]  So there is government control.
[02:41:14.009 --> 02:41:16.491]  I've seen operations basically frustrated.
[02:41:16.531 --> 02:41:18.013]  The IRA didn't know what was hitting them.
[02:41:18.773 --> 02:41:20.655]  And I've seen operations that did go ahead and
[02:41:21.857 --> 02:41:25.680]  I mean, I would not have known in advance, so I couldn't tell them afterwards, but I would tell them afterwards.
[02:41:26.261 --> 02:41:27.842]  And things were covered up.
[02:41:27.862 --> 02:41:30.885]  I mean, there was collusion in every aspect.
[02:41:31.225 --> 02:41:37.190]  Well, bottom line, the state stood to gain from having terror as a pretext to scare the population into submission.
[02:41:39.312 --> 02:41:42.735]  Kevin, at what point did you decide to go public?
[02:41:43.056 --> 02:41:46.959]  I mean, did it happen gradually, or did you just wake up one morning and say, that's it, I'm going public?
[02:41:47.981 --> 02:41:51.965]  No, actually, listen, I have to say, I have to accept my responsibility.
[02:41:52.125 --> 02:41:54.607]  I was a willing tool of the state as a soldier.
[02:41:55.428 --> 02:41:56.308]  I was in a compartment.
[02:41:56.328 --> 02:41:58.670]  I thought I was doing right, fighting terrorists.
[02:41:59.471 --> 02:42:06.057]  And when they tried to actually hit, my own bosses in the intelligence services tried to have me killed by Agent Steakknife.
[02:42:06.717 --> 02:42:09.139]  They set up a complete operation and everybody was caught.
[02:42:09.179 --> 02:42:10.180]  The IRA member caught.
[02:42:10.460 --> 02:42:11.661]  But you were a good agent.
[02:42:11.741 --> 02:42:13.743]  I mean, you were going along to get along.
[02:42:13.783 --> 02:42:15.385]  Why did they try to have Steakknife kill you?
[02:42:17.136 --> 02:42:19.737]  Well, the best way to put it, Alex, is I know too much.
[02:42:21.297 --> 02:42:22.357]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:42:22.377 --> 02:42:24.278]  I am a loose end.
[02:42:24.398 --> 02:42:25.438]  Well, that shows.
[02:42:25.498 --> 02:42:28.659]  So basically, you've gone public because for no reason they tried to kill you.
[02:42:29.119 --> 02:42:35.981]  And see, folks, that shows how criminal this system is, is they'll just try to kill and kill their own agents.
[02:42:36.041 --> 02:42:37.121]  How many people have been killed?
[02:42:37.161 --> 02:42:38.001]  I've been researching this.
[02:42:38.041 --> 02:42:41.322]  I'm seeing all these photos of dead, tortured bodies of agents.
[02:42:41.662 --> 02:42:45.923]  How many people do you know of that your government's killed who were agents?
[02:42:46.869 --> 02:42:47.890]  Martin, you take that one.
[02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:50.451]  You would be more into the amount of agents that were killed.
[02:42:51.411 --> 02:42:52.592]  Well, many, many.
[02:42:53.412 --> 02:43:00.035]  I can think of... Well, one of the most famous ones was one of my agents, a man called Frank Hegarty.
[02:43:01.196 --> 02:43:06.518]  Frank Hegarty was responsible for bringing in a very large shipment of Libyan arms.
[02:43:07.659 --> 02:43:12.921]  And ultimately, it was the largest ever find of arms on the island of Ireland.
[02:43:13.341 --> 02:43:15.102]  And he was killed by an agent...
[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:21.243]  By steak knife and by Martin McGuinness, who were working together.
[02:43:21.883 --> 02:43:26.346]  And effectively, there are many, many other agents.
[02:43:26.706 --> 02:43:31.329]  Ruby Davidson, you know, there are loads and loads of agents who've been killed by other agents.
[02:43:32.289 --> 02:43:42.475]  Another one, Martin McGatland, who was taken to be killed, and he threw himself out of a third floor set of flats, very high up, and...
[02:43:43.226 --> 02:43:46.789]  Basically saved his life by running through a glass pane of window.
[02:43:48.170 --> 02:43:50.212]  There are many, many incidents of it.
[02:43:50.472 --> 02:43:54.316]  But just to come back... Yeah, so they were grabbing on him going, come with us, and he went, no!
[02:43:54.456 --> 02:43:55.477]  Boom, out the window.
[02:43:55.917 --> 02:43:57.979]  Yeah, they had him for a number of hours.
[02:43:58.019 --> 02:44:03.404]  They were waiting for the killers to come and basically kill him.
[02:44:04.034 --> 02:44:07.675]  And he thought better of it, and he was tied up just like a turkey.
[02:44:08.215 --> 02:44:12.376]  And being very brave and very stubborn, he decided that he wasn't going to die.
[02:44:12.756 --> 02:44:13.857]  So he threw himself at it.
[02:44:13.937 --> 02:44:15.717]  Or at least don't die the way they want to.
[02:44:15.817 --> 02:44:17.938]  Go hobble over to the window and jump out, yeah.
[02:44:18.138 --> 02:44:18.658]  Absolutely.
[02:44:18.698 --> 02:44:19.918]  He took a running jump at it.
[02:44:20.259 --> 02:44:29.121]  But just to give your viewers an insight into the level of infiltration, one of the most high-profile killings in the North, and I'm certain you've heard of it,
[02:44:29.565 --> 02:44:31.506]  Is the murder of Mr. Patrick Finucane.
[02:44:31.587 --> 02:44:32.747]  Sure, yeah.
[02:44:32.787 --> 02:44:42.914]  The lawyer, basically, out of the nine people that committed that murder, seven are agents of the state.
[02:44:43.735 --> 02:44:45.256]  And why did the government want him dead?
[02:44:46.437 --> 02:44:50.260]  Well, it's not so much the government... I know, the criminal elements within the state.
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:59.246]  Yeah, criminal elements within the state, because he upset a lot of people within the police and other agencies by defending the rights
[02:45:05.627 --> 02:45:13.453]  Well, I think right here is the problem with having soldiers involved in domestic activities.
[02:45:13.853 --> 02:45:15.675]  Soldiers are trained to go kill people.
[02:45:15.715 --> 02:45:17.016]  They're not trained to be police.
[02:45:17.436 --> 02:45:20.819]  You start putting soldiers into domestic operations, they're going to start killing people.
[02:45:21.869 --> 02:45:25.710]  Yeah, but in that instance, that was police, not police.
[02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:26.810]  Lily, so it was the police.
[02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:27.431]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:45:28.091 --> 02:45:29.111]  That was the police, you see.
[02:45:29.731 --> 02:45:30.731]  Well, then it never ends.
[02:45:30.811 --> 02:45:37.533]  It just, I mean, what do you think about the setup of domestic militarized police here in the U.S.
[02:45:37.613 --> 02:45:43.475]  and secret police and secret arrest and secret torture and the president openly talking about it?
[02:45:44.195 --> 02:45:46.956]  Well, it's certainly, you have moved away from
[02:45:47.795 --> 02:46:03.579]  Some of your fundamental principles, which your democracy is built on, and you do have a Bill of Rights, where we don't have a Bill of Rights in the United Kingdom, and effectively, you know, your rights are enshrined in law.
[02:46:03.959 --> 02:46:06.459]  Kevin, what do you think of what's happening in this country?
[02:46:07.940 --> 02:46:13.361]  Well, I mean, the one aspect, yes, I believe in law and order, but I mean, who watches law and order?
[02:46:14.293 --> 02:46:21.638]  My boss and MI5 used to have a saying, they used to have great sayings, and I always remember, and he used to say, governments can come and go, but we are always here.
[02:46:22.639 --> 02:46:30.625]  And I always remember that, but I mean, there are a lot of good policemen, a lot of good everybody, but there is other people who make decisions who, you know, you don't see.
[02:46:30.645 --> 02:46:34.847]  You know, I found that out the hard way, but thankfully I'm still here at the moment.
[02:46:35.548 --> 02:46:37.229]  But I mean, I couldn't see the woods or the trees.
[02:46:38.530 --> 02:46:42.653]  So you were in the middle of it going along until they just decided to kill you to get rid of you.
[02:46:43.422 --> 02:46:44.103]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:46:44.483 --> 02:46:49.246]  And now what they're doing now is, since a release, the book came out, Unsung Hero.
[02:46:50.167 --> 02:46:51.708]  I didn't choose the title, by the way.
[02:46:51.808 --> 02:46:53.349]  I mean, I don't class myself as a hero.
[02:46:53.849 --> 02:46:57.451]  But they have now started a criminal investigation into my activities.
[02:46:57.471 --> 02:47:11.161]  I mean, we're seeing in the newspapers where the United States government and the British government accused Iran of supplying this infrared technology to all these... Yes, yeah, the Arabs.
[02:47:12.401 --> 02:47:21.388]  Well, the thing is, Greg Harkin spoke to himself as a journalist to expose this stuff, and he exposed it in the British newspapers that the IRA basically developed it.
[02:47:21.628 --> 02:47:27.192]  The British government and the Americans helped an agent of the state, which was me, to purchase the stuff and bring it back.
[02:47:27.893 --> 02:47:29.034]  And the IRA shorted out.
[02:47:29.174 --> 02:47:31.976]  Now, the British government then had to withdraw that comment.
[02:47:32.961 --> 02:47:40.106]  That's right, and so a lot of the bombs overseas in the Middle East, they're not being triggered by cell phones, it's triggered by infrared, correct?
[02:47:40.166 --> 02:47:40.646]  A lasing?
[02:47:40.686 --> 02:47:45.189]  It's like infrared beams, yeah, infrared light, flashes and infrared beams.
[02:47:45.909 --> 02:47:46.770]  They do a number of things.
[02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:49.251]  Telephones, you see, they can put out, block the signals.
[02:47:49.812 --> 02:47:51.353]  That's why the IRA developed it.
[02:47:51.853 --> 02:47:53.934]  But you can't block line-of-sight lasing?
[02:47:55.175 --> 02:47:55.715]  No, you can't.
[02:47:55.875 --> 02:47:58.657]  They're trying to get away around it, and they cannot find the way around it.
[02:47:59.538 --> 02:48:01.299]  Light is a frequency of light, and
[02:48:01.874 --> 02:48:06.675]  You know, some of the stuff that I got in New York, it was coded infrared.
[02:48:06.995 --> 02:48:09.876]  You punched in a code in your transmitter and the receiver.
[02:48:09.896 --> 02:48:11.496]  If the code didn't match, it wouldn't work.
[02:48:12.076 --> 02:48:14.317]  Now, these were innocent things for photography.
[02:48:15.137 --> 02:48:17.938]  But they were re-engineered to set off bombs.
[02:48:18.658 --> 02:48:21.599]  Yeah, so you're saying right now that isn't coming from Iran?
[02:48:22.639 --> 02:48:25.700]  No, that came from IRA, British Intelligence.
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:26.820]  Yeah, of course.
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:29.261]  Of course the bombs are British Intelligence in Iraq.
[02:48:29.581 --> 02:48:30.881]  Or at least that's where it came from.
[02:48:31.557 --> 02:48:36.744]  I mean, look at British SAS, got caught dressed up like Arabs with beards, running around with bombs, shooting people.
[02:48:36.764 --> 02:48:44.154]  In fact, let me ask you guys about that, what happened in Basra late last year when we get back in the final segment, and then tell us about the book, too.
[02:48:49.079 --> 02:48:52.282]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:54.564]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.944 --> 02:49:02.590]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.271 --> 02:49:10.316]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.736 --> 02:49:13.639]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:14.059 --> 02:49:16.361]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.801 --> 02:49:17.602]  NSA spies.
[02:49:19.032 --> 02:49:22.173]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:49:22.433 --> 02:49:25.953]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.414 --> 02:49:28.334]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.674 --> 02:49:32.555]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:29.463 --> 02:52:36.746]  We have a lot of great affiliates across the country, but stations come and stations go, but the Internet, we hope, will always be there for you.
[02:52:38.466 --> 02:52:39.907]  This broadcast is almost over.
[02:52:39.947 --> 02:52:42.308]  I know we had a lot of callers who were holding, but that was on other issues.
[02:52:42.648 --> 02:52:43.508]  We can't go to your calls.
[02:52:44.509 --> 02:52:54.032]  And I appreciate the courage of both these men to go public here on the broadcast to great danger to themselves, but you've heard them to be more dangerous to not go public.
[02:52:54.765 --> 02:52:55.326]  It's Amazon.co.uk.
[02:52:55.426 --> 02:52:57.167]  It's Unsung Hero by Kevin Fulton.
[02:52:57.187 --> 02:52:58.208]  I didn't pick the title.
[02:53:17.260 --> 02:53:23.443]  I understand, that's the publisher, but I know you're not saying you're a hero, but you are going public and that is heroic.
[02:53:24.744 --> 02:53:26.045]  Absolutely, folks should get the book.
[02:53:26.085 --> 02:53:27.145]  I hear it's pretty powerful.
[02:53:27.846 --> 02:53:30.927]  In closing, gentlemen, any other key points people should be made aware of?
[02:53:32.328 --> 02:53:33.669]  Always keep asking questions.
[02:53:33.769 --> 02:53:35.430]  Never take anything you're told for granted.
[02:53:37.050 --> 02:53:37.831]  That's what I would say.
[02:53:38.611 --> 02:53:40.372]  I would concur with that.
[02:53:40.412 --> 02:53:44.174]  The most obvious point is not always the one that's in your face.
[02:53:44.714 --> 02:53:45.995]  Always look behind the curtain.
[02:53:47.529 --> 02:53:49.450]  Start questioning a little bit.
[02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:51.911]  Start not being so gullible.
[02:53:52.211 --> 02:53:57.013]  Listen, that's my motto, because I am just amazed by the crimes.
[02:53:57.053 --> 02:53:58.433]  Take your government, my government.
[02:53:58.753 --> 02:54:00.694]  Project Shed, we did that together.
[02:54:01.014 --> 02:54:06.476]  They take our own troops and nerve gas innocent troops to death just to see what nerve gas would do.
[02:54:06.536 --> 02:54:08.637]  I mean, how can we trust anything these governments do?
[02:54:10.298 --> 02:54:10.778]  Very true.
[02:54:11.989 --> 02:54:18.274]  I don't know how so many criminals have gotten into government and basically set up their own little empires, but it's bad.
[02:54:20.175 --> 02:54:29.102]  But as Kevin outlined a few minutes ago, it's not so much the governments, because governments can be removed at... Bureaucracy.
[02:54:29.443 --> 02:54:36.068]  But it's the... Well, in our system, it's the civil service which is there forever and a day.
[02:54:36.525 --> 02:54:38.667]  And that is what really runs the government.
[02:54:38.707 --> 02:54:43.570]  Well, the government thinks it's running the country, but effectively the civil service runs the government.
[02:54:43.930 --> 02:54:44.811]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:54:44.831 --> 02:54:49.674]  You've got the private global corporate interests that come in and pay off and manipulate the civil service.
[02:54:50.835 --> 02:54:53.797]  Well, they manipulate the system full stop.
[02:54:54.758 --> 02:54:57.380]  And in today's globalization...
[02:54:57.745 --> 02:55:02.791]  They're becoming the most powerful component of all.
[02:55:03.311 --> 02:55:03.832]  Absolutely.
[02:55:03.892 --> 02:55:06.014]  Martin Ingram, we've got links to your blog.
[02:55:06.334 --> 02:55:08.116]  Any other things we should go visit?
[02:55:09.638 --> 02:55:18.708]  Well, if you go and visit Sinn Fein's website, you will basically be visiting another section of the British government.
[02:55:20.194 --> 02:55:20.895]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:55:21.515 --> 02:55:25.878]  And that's why these people are in control, because they're masters at controlling all sides.
[02:55:25.938 --> 02:55:27.299]  And we need to realize that.
[02:55:27.659 --> 02:55:31.921]  Well, gentlemen, I hope to get you back up in the future to have a longer talk and take calls.
[02:55:32.262 --> 02:55:34.223]  Thank you for spending time with us this evening.
[02:55:34.883 --> 02:55:35.864]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:55:36.264 --> 02:55:36.924]  And be careful.
[02:55:36.944 --> 02:55:39.186]  I'll see you... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:55:40.066 --> 02:55:42.608]  Just saying good evening to your listeners, and thanks for having us on.
[02:55:42.768 --> 02:55:43.569]  Good evening to you.
[02:55:43.629 --> 02:55:44.789]  Take care, and Godspeed.
[02:55:44.849 --> 02:55:45.810]  We should all pray for you.
[02:55:46.370 --> 02:55:47.031]  Well, there you are.
[02:55:47.131 --> 02:55:49.052]  Most of the bombings are carried out by the government.
[02:55:50.485 --> 02:55:52.967]  And Martin Ingram was one of the commanders.
[02:55:53.888 --> 02:55:56.329]  And then we also have it from the low level with Kevin Fulton.
[02:55:56.369 --> 02:55:57.590]  Both recruited out of the Army.
[02:55:58.091 --> 02:55:59.231]  Both patriotic men.
[02:56:00.472 --> 02:56:03.535]  And there they were telling you the government stages most of the terror.
[02:56:04.375 --> 02:56:05.856]  Just like they stage 9-11.
[02:56:06.377 --> 02:56:07.898]  Just like they'll stage the next event.
[02:56:07.958 --> 02:56:11.741]  Don't worry, they'll have some stupid Arab to drag out and blame for it.
[02:56:12.501 --> 02:56:19.186]  The real target is you and your freedoms and your liberties, so you better get Terror Storm and make copies and get it out to everybody.
[02:56:19.787 --> 02:56:20.789]  Terror Storm!
