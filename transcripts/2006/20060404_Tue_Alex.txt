[00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.281]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:07.982]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.702 --> 00:00:09.823]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:11.303]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:13.044]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:17.586]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.786 --> 00:00:21.908]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:44.113]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:49.100]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday edition, the fourth day of April.
[00:00:50.994 --> 00:01:09.211]  2006.
[00:00:51.234 --> 00:01:09.211]  And coming up in the next hour, we'll have professor, theologian, David Ray Griffin, author of two best-selling books on September 11th, and one of the most effective people out there exposing the government inside job, joining us in the next hour.
[00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.532]  We will, of course, be able to take phone calls today.
[00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:17.414]  I'll be doing that from my studios here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:23.978]  So later, I will give you that toll-free number, and you'll be able to call into the broadcast.
[00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:31.923]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and now
[00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:34.794]  JonesReport.com.
[00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:38.895]  I've had Jones Report for about, what, five years, but we updated it about once a year.
[00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:44.357]  It was just kind of a static site floating around out there in the asteroid belt of the blogosphere.
[00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:49.038]  But now it's being updated daily, sometimes multiple times daily.
[00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:50.898]  It's a little different than the other sites.
[00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:53.139]  It has a lot of the same headlines and news and information.
[00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:57.663]  But it also has some of its new archives on 9-11.
[00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:00.285]  It's going to be a big 9-11 site will be its main function.
[00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:12.617]  Also archives on depleted uranium, archives on sodium and stannous fluoride, archives on mercury and lead, archives on some of the things that are in our environment that are a serious problem.
[00:02:13.337 --> 00:02:22.223]  So I'm very proud of the job that Aaron Dykes, one of our new team members here in the last few months, is doing on that and other projects.
[00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:26.406]  So be sure and tell everybody about JonesReport.com.
[00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:32.250]  We're putting a lot of work into it, and it's a very simple site, a quick download site, no bells and whistles.
[00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.933]  It's of course modeled after the Drudge Report, hence the Jones Report.
[00:02:37.414 --> 00:02:39.195]  JonesReport.com.
[00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:41.957]  Be sure and check it out today.
[00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:45.518]  A lot of original content there on the site.
[00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.240]  It also serves as a mirror of the top stories of the other sites.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:03:02.587]  We do this so we have more servers, more redundancy, more cruisers, more ships on the high seas in the information battle, engaging the enemy and crushing them on every front.
[00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:10.511]  Smashing them as we march towards the empire to bring down the New World Order and restore our constitutional republic.
[00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.455]  We are engaging the enemies of the Republic at point-blank range.
[00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:24.564]  We will continue to engage the enemies of the Republic and all free humans on this planet every single day dedicated to the fight.
[00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:26.646]  And I lead by example here.
[00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:28.448]  I was here until 1 a.m.
[00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:30.610]  last night and I will be here tonight at 1 a.m.
[00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.291]  and I will be here the next night at 1 a.m.
[00:03:32.572 --> 00:03:34.774]  and I will be here the next night because we're making a new film.
[00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:37.042]  And we're doing a lot of other things.
[00:03:37.102 --> 00:03:38.623]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:41.004]  Masses of news in this first hour.
[00:03:41.244 --> 00:03:45.305]  And yes, we will take some of your calls trying out this new system.
[00:03:47.086 --> 00:03:50.027]  And we are working that out right now with the network.
[00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:52.408]  The new toll-free number to join us on air is 888-234-4564.
[00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:54.849]  And of course, someday in the future.
[00:04:01.918 --> 00:04:09.902]  Someday in the future, light years from now, we will have the old 1-800-259-9231 number, but for now, 888-234-4564, and we will be taking your calls in this... I've got my 1-800 number wired right in here to my laptop computer.
[00:04:22.757 --> 00:04:37.529]  And we're going to try to run that back into the network and have them run the calls live from there, but if that snafu's here with the gremlins constantly invading us, we will wire it into my board here and get around that problem and move forward.
[00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.892]  So, uh, 888-234-4564, 888-234-4564, because I will not be stopped if I can help it.
[00:04:48.218 --> 00:04:48.860]  Alright, a lot of news.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.084]  We'll tell you about it when we get back on the other side.
[00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:55.552]  More about this nutcase professor here at UT trying to defend himself now.
[00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:57.396]  And a lot more on the other side.
[00:04:57.416 --> 00:04:57.997]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:09.481]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:14.507]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.727 --> 00:05:20.375]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:25.139]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.507]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.527 --> 00:05:35.930]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.050]  And much, much more.
[00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.731]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:46.713]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:03.883]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.203 --> 00:06:06.985]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.265 --> 00:06:11.408]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:12.669]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.553]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:20.175]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:21.556]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:06:21.957 --> 00:06:35.368]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:07:00.945 --> 00:07:06.931]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:07:07.132 --> 00:07:09.474]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:13.018]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[00:07:13.238 --> 00:07:18.003]  Protect-A Engine Treatment, Protect-A Transmission Treatment, and Protect-A Complete Fuel System Treatment.

[00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:53.725]  Call now!
[00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:08.658]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.278 --> 00:08:12.300]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.762 --> 00:08:18.484]  The information war certainly does continue.
[00:08:20.005 --> 00:08:23.027]  Alright, I'm going to get into some of these other headlines later in the hour.
[00:08:23.407 --> 00:08:26.630]  UK Big Brother has eye on ID card Refusenix.
[00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.192]  Eliminates opportunity for stay of execution.
[00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:41.764]  And if you don't take their national ID card that's been voted down, what, eight times now, but Blair is going to use the Parliament Act to force the House of Lords to acquiesce to the demands.
[00:08:42.484 --> 00:08:46.226]  Eighty-plus percent of Britons in polls are against the national ID card.
[00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:53.929]  The illegal aliens that have flooded the country, as they've flooded all Western governments, part of the globalist crime family program to bring down sovereign nations,
[00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.174]  They don't have to carry the cards, and if you don't carry it, you are not allowed to leave your house.
[00:08:59.214 --> 00:09:00.135]  This is mainstream news.
[00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:01.596]  You will then be arrested.
[00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:07.842]  You will then be deported to some unnamed country, even if you are a citizen of the United Kingdom.
[00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:09.684]  Oh, Britannia!
[00:09:10.144 --> 00:09:12.566]  And the same thing is going to happen here in the United States.
[00:09:12.606 --> 00:09:17.411]  They passed the REAL ID, National ID Card Act, last year, but over the next two years,
[00:09:18.522 --> 00:09:32.364]  All states under federal law must acquiesce and implement the National ID Card Thumb Scan, Face Scan, Smart Chip, and Swipe system on all cards under federal regulations.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.362]  Now, several states are saying that they're going to pass laws.
[00:09:37.422 --> 00:09:39.824]  Places like West Virginia is moving to block it.
[00:09:40.264 --> 00:09:42.806]  Areas like Vermont, New Hampshire are moving to block it.
[00:09:43.226 --> 00:09:48.590]  A lot of exciting things happening because these are totally unconstitutional federal laws.
[00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:55.314]  And this will be used as your new national ID card for the new national sales tax being pushed by phony conservatives who are not conservative at all.
[00:09:55.614 --> 00:09:59.717]  And it will bring federal control into every search engine, every terminal, every shopping card.
[00:10:00.217 --> 00:10:16.070]  Every cash register, every lawn man that comes and mows your yard, every lemonade stand, even if you pay cash, by law, you've got to swipe the card to make sure you're paying your new national sales tax when they try to ram that through.
[00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:21.415]  And of course, if you're against a whole new layer of taxation, you're an evil liberal.
[00:10:21.895 --> 00:10:24.617]  And they're not going to get rid of the IRS, they're going to keep that as well.
[00:10:24.637 --> 00:10:25.278]  So we'll get into that
[00:10:26.748 --> 00:10:29.650]  More on the Scientist Cheer Holocaust Wish.
[00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.832]  Texas Academy honored professor who once 90% of the human race exterminated.
[00:10:34.632 --> 00:10:37.733]  And I want to get more into this report.
[00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:41.875]  We covered it a lot yesterday, but we didn't spend enough time on it.
[00:10:41.935 --> 00:10:43.636]  It is of the utmost importance.
[00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:53.981]  And it ties in with Mr. Gutierrez, Jose Angel Gutierrez, professor at UT, that says we've got to kill all the whites.
[00:10:55.023 --> 00:11:02.007]  And he was the head of Hispanic Studies at UT and kind of got broken down a few years ago because of all his speeches saying, kill everybody.
[00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:03.868]  But he's back at it again.
[00:11:03.908 --> 00:11:19.437]  In fact, we played clips here before when I've done a TV show on it during Mexican Independence last year because some of his followers were leading some of the marches here locally and had their t-shirts on saying, all whites above the age of 16, all white males must be killed.
[00:11:20.298 --> 00:11:24.160]  And then I've been rebuked for criticizing it, for saying that I don't want to be killed.
[00:11:24.795 --> 00:11:46.082]  And there's a lot of denial about this, just like there's denial, just like there's massive denial concerning what's going on with Dr. Pionka, Professor, Doctor, the prestigious Pionka, who says that 90% of us need to die and the dying needs to start now.
[00:11:47.552 --> 00:11:50.517]  Of course, Mr. Pianka is now backpedaling.
[00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:53.502]  We have a local newscast where he's backpedaling.
[00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:55.565]  We're also going to link to an entire interview they did.
[00:11:55.585 --> 00:11:56.126]  They didn't just...
[00:11:57.361 --> 00:11:57.982]  We're good to go.
[00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:29.775]  But I tell you what, before I get into all this news, let me just first off get into Jose Gutierrez.
[00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:33.916]  Understand that he is indicative.
[00:12:34.036 --> 00:12:35.717]  He is the norm.
[00:12:37.178 --> 00:12:38.798]  He is the benchmark.
[00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:42.340]  He's up at UT Dallas.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.322]  Pianka is at UT Austin, the main mothership here in Austin, Texas.
[00:12:49.156 --> 00:12:52.998]  And I became aware of Mecha La Raza and others.
[00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:57.801]  Mecha stands for the Aztec Kingdom of the Southwest and translated into Spanish.
[00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:05.545]  And then, of course, when you look at La Raza, that means the race.
[00:13:06.165 --> 00:13:08.586]  And that was the chant here in Austin and L.A.
[00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:14.169]  and Chicago and Phoenix and all across the nation was Viva La Raza, the race!
[00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:18.483]  And when you read these groups, Universal Literature, they say, for our race, everything.
[00:13:18.503 --> 00:13:20.244]  For those outside the race, nothing.
[00:13:20.304 --> 00:13:22.785]  That is a mecha-motto.
[00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:24.246]  But they're all very similar.
[00:13:24.306 --> 00:13:28.328]  When they get caught red-handed, they say, no, we mean the human race.
[00:13:28.748 --> 00:13:40.474]  But you read their founding documents, and what they're currently actually saying in their publications, it is the Chicano-Aztlan race, or the Mesoamerican race.
[00:13:41.582 --> 00:13:56.192]  I guess a mixture of European conquerors, settlers, predominantly Spanish and Portuguese, and later the French and the Germans, big influence in Mexico, and of course in Latin America in general.
[00:13:57.013 --> 00:14:00.475]  And so we're just going to report what they actually say here.
[00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:10.382]  Saturday night I called into a national radio show and heard one of these amnesty asylum groups that runs a big operation out of Chicago,
[00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:13.556]  And the guest just said, no, it's not true.
[00:14:13.616 --> 00:14:15.517]  She's never heard of anyone with a Mexican flag.
[00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:18.919]  They only have American flags at these demonstrations.
[00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.500]  And they only love America.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.261]  And they do not believe this is Mexico.
[00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.482]  And I'm just a big fat liar.
[00:14:24.582 --> 00:14:25.582]  I'm making it all up.
[00:14:25.622 --> 00:14:32.826]  And then a caller from San Antonio called in to back her up and said, yes, Alex Jones is just as sensational as he makes all of this up.
[00:14:33.767 --> 00:14:37.009]  And the caller said, I've never heard of such a thing.
[00:14:37.049 --> 00:14:41.251]  Well, maybe you've been hiding under a rock, but somehow I doubt that.
[00:14:42.165 --> 00:14:48.929]  Now let me make it clear, and every time I say this, these very people go, oh shut up, Gringo, you're a racist, that's what you all say.
[00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:50.530]  But no, it's not true.
[00:14:51.010 --> 00:15:08.221]  Many of my friends, in fact one of my best friends, is Hispanic, and they're Americans, just as American or more so than I am, very patriotic people, and they certainly don't want to live in Mexico, and they certainly don't believe Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma,
[00:15:09.224 --> 00:15:15.445]  California, Nevada, Washington, and Oregon, and parts of Idaho and Wyoming.
[00:15:15.825 --> 00:15:17.465]  That's now what Aslan is claiming.
[00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:19.286]  A few years ago it was half that.
[00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:29.128]  They certainly don't like that idea, and they certainly don't like the fact that America is imploding with all this cheap third world labor.
[00:15:30.008 --> 00:15:31.048]  Our government loves it.
[00:15:31.068 --> 00:15:32.128]  They want blanket amnesty.
[00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:33.408]  They love all these policies.
[00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:36.949]  So I don't want to hear that you're down fraud and you're fighting against the man
[00:15:37.489 --> 00:15:40.131]  The man is behind this.
[00:15:41.932 --> 00:15:45.774]  But, I mean, where to start?
[00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:50.016]  I'm looking for my Jose Gutierrez article here.
[00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:52.618]  DV Kid did a report on this, and again, we reported on this last year.
[00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:58.421]  We have this guy on tape saying this, but a Mexican university professor calls for murder of all whites.
[00:15:59.221 --> 00:16:04.064]  And the tape I have of him says that, but he also says we need to implement the plan of San Diego.
[00:16:05.026 --> 00:16:08.454]  Which was a German funded plan that was executed.
[00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:13.124]  And there was Charlie Manson style murders all over South Texas in a matter of days.
[00:16:13.424 --> 00:16:14.988]  The death toll was staggering.
[00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:25.921]  And that actually created some of the first enmity between South Texas Hispanics, who saw themselves as Mexicans, and the white population here.
[00:16:26.521 --> 00:16:36.771]  Before that, the Czechoslovakian, the Polish, and the German, and the British, and the Scottish and Irish communities, people seemed to back then be in their own communities.
[00:16:38.276 --> 00:16:48.926]  There was more intermarrying, and more living together, and more getting along, like you wouldn't have Germans in a Czech town, but you'd have Mexicans there, or Tejanos, Texans, Mexican-Texans.
[00:16:49.906 --> 00:16:51.608]  And that's just a historical Texas fact.
[00:16:51.628 --> 00:16:55.431]  Go take Texas history, and go look at these towns and witness it for yourselves.
[00:16:56.312 --> 00:16:59.635]  You've got, you know, all of these German-looking big
[00:17:00.382 --> 00:17:09.085]  You know, big, olive-skinned, dark-haired people whose, you know, grandma was Mrs. Gonzales, who married Mr. Schmidt.
[00:17:09.665 --> 00:17:11.526]  But no, that's all over now.
[00:17:12.306 --> 00:17:16.607]  Now we have the l'Reconquista upon us.
[00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:21.749]  And it's really disgusting and a serious problem.
[00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:26.437]  Mexican University professor calls for murder of all whites.
[00:17:26.977 --> 00:17:32.459]  We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean is by that if the worst comes to worst, we've got to kill him.
[00:17:33.319 --> 00:17:38.240]  The words above were spoken by Jose Gutierrez, professor, University of Texas, Arlington.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.841]  I just say Dallas, same thing, Metroplex.
[00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:44.882]  And founder of La Raza Unida political party, or the race.
[00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:48.583]  His full comment was, we have an aging white America.
[00:17:48.623 --> 00:17:49.243]  They are dying.
[00:17:49.283 --> 00:17:50.763]  We have got to eliminate the gringo.
[00:17:51.003 --> 00:17:53.824]  And what I mean by this is, worse comes to worse, we've got to kill him!
[00:17:55.084 --> 00:17:56.565]  And people don't know the actual numbers.
[00:17:56.585 --> 00:18:00.986]  They're looking at five-year-old numbers, you know, that the majority in the below 20 are Hispanic.
[00:18:01.006 --> 00:18:01.246]  No, no, no.
[00:18:01.446 --> 00:18:03.046]  The majority, period, is now Hispanic.
[00:18:03.586 --> 00:18:11.208]  In a matter of five years, and again, if they wanted to be American, if they weren't flooding in from Latin America, running around screaming with Mexican flags, it wouldn't be a problem.
[00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:14.029]  But they're here saying, we're taking America down.
[00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:22.882]  In a column dated March 25th, 06 by Ernesto Sintagulos titled, La Gran Marcha,
[00:18:24.095 --> 00:18:25.756]  surpasses all expectations.
[00:18:25.956 --> 00:18:32.379]  He wrote, What does the immense success of La Grande Marche mean to Mexicanos and Latinos?
[00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:47.206]  It simply means that we now have the numbers, the political will, and the simple means that we now have the numbers, political will, and the organizational skills to direct our own destinies and not be subservient to the white and Jewish power structure.
[00:18:47.706 --> 00:18:51.868]  Really, it's the white and Jewish power structure, and I can prove that, I have, that funds you.
[00:18:53.314 --> 00:19:00.540]  I mean, it's a big Jewish mogul that owns the majority of the TV stations in the United States that are Spanish speaking.
[00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:02.963]  We've got World Net Daily and AP articles about it.
[00:19:03.924 --> 00:19:08.508]  And he put up 670 plus signs saying California is now Mexico.
[00:19:08.568 --> 00:19:11.971]  Remember crossing out L.A., California and putting Mexico on it?
[00:19:13.733 --> 00:19:14.854]  I mean, this is what's happening.
[00:19:14.974 --> 00:19:15.895]  What are you talking about?
[00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:29.487]  It means that we can now undertake bigger and more significant mass actions to achieve total political and economic liberation, like that being proposed by Jose Gutierrez, President of the Latino USA.
[00:19:29.827 --> 00:19:40.254]  Jose Gutierrez is proposing that the coalition that organized La Grande March meet in Arizona or Texas on April 8th to organize a mass boycott against the economy of the U.S.
[00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.236]  to take place on May 5th or 19th.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:54.198]  And let me tell you, I could go to this meeting with an interpreter, I could record it all, or a lot of it will be in English, and it'll be openly, as soon as we got the numbers, we're gonna kill you, and if I'm against being murdered, I'm dead.
[00:19:54.739 --> 00:19:56.102]  And of course, none of this exists.
[00:19:56.182 --> 00:19:56.763]  Everything's fine.
[00:20:02.873 --> 00:20:07.375]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.716 --> 00:20:11.818]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.098 --> 00:20:12.658]  We listened.
[00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:17.941]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:18.702]  We listened.
[00:20:19.082 --> 00:20:22.123]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.544 --> 00:20:23.084]  We listened.
[00:20:23.544 --> 00:20:26.706]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:20:26.926 --> 00:20:27.246]  I don't know.
[00:20:53.442 --> 00:20:54.403]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:20:54.423 --> 00:20:56.064]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:20:56.084 --> 00:20:57.444]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:20:57.504 --> 00:20:58.745]  One and the same.
[00:20:58.825 --> 00:21:07.350]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.297 --> 00:21:24.419]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.699 --> 00:21:26.520]  The bank pays you 1%.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.041]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.302 --> 00:21:32.363]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.743 --> 00:21:36.305]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.805 --> 00:21:40.467]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.027 --> 00:21:43.548]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[00:21:50.454 --> 00:21:50.694]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.449 --> 00:22:03.931]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.951 --> 00:22:11.055]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:17.019]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:29.507]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.
[00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:38.255]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:40.256 --> 00:22:40.656]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:02.821]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:06.222]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:23:06.542 --> 00:23:11.823]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:23:12.123 --> 00:23:21.665]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:23:21.945 --> 00:23:24.126]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[00:23:24.426 --> 00:23:27.988]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:23:28.228 --> 00:23:31.470]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.293]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:23:35.453 --> 00:23:38.915]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:23:39.055 --> 00:23:40.316]  I'm really amazed.
[00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:46.319]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:23:46.459 --> 00:23:48.861]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:55.936]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:23:55.956 --> 00:23:57.319]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:24:12.654 --> 00:24:19.685]  This weekend listening to talk radio and reading the blogs and seeing what the Liberty Conquistadors are saying is, is they're very very slick.
[00:24:21.007 --> 00:24:27.317]  In fact they even admit that they served out American flags, this is mainstream news, at the fronts of the rallies.
[00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:32.091]  And then our national complicit media would just focus on those.
[00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:35.874]  Meanwhile, 90 plus percent were foreign flags.
[00:24:36.594 --> 00:24:41.297]  And then when they have their leaders on radio, they have one crowd that goes out and says they're all friends.
[00:24:41.317 --> 00:24:43.479]  They go, we don't know what you're talking about.
[00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:44.820]  Reconquista?
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.820]  That's made up.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.022]  No one's ever heard of that.
[00:24:48.782 --> 00:24:53.065]  What do you mean we say the Southwest belongs to Mexico?
[00:24:54.173 --> 00:25:01.236]  And then, folks, you go to one of these rallies, I mean, there'll be 10,000 people there, and that's all that's being discussed.
[00:25:01.817 --> 00:25:04.178]  I mean, that is universal.
[00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:07.019]  And so it's very sneaky.
[00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:14.743]  I mean, imagine, it's a perfect takeover plan, that's what the globalists are using, these foreigners, is that an average American doesn't speak the language, doesn't know what's going on.
[00:25:15.203 --> 00:25:18.565]  Again, my wife does, because she lived, I don't know, five, six years in Spain.
[00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:31.256]  Her dad was in the Agriculture Department in the Diplomatic Corps, so she grew up and knows Spanish fluently, and we were driving through Mejia to go visit family a few months ago, and she's like, look at that grocery store!
[00:25:31.936 --> 00:25:37.139]  It says Mexico Land, you know, the new land, and look at that sign, it says, you know, we're taking over!
[00:25:37.879 --> 00:25:39.420]  And she said, it's everywhere!
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.001]  It says Revolution right there!
[00:25:41.021 --> 00:25:42.222]  It says Revolution right there!
[00:25:42.982 --> 00:25:46.424]  They've got a Mexican radio station here in Austin called the Invader.
[00:25:47.122 --> 00:25:49.743]  They have another one in San Antonio called The Usurper.
[00:25:50.303 --> 00:25:53.905]  There's another radio station called The Bandit.
[00:25:54.605 --> 00:25:57.086]  And they've got them called Raza.
[00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:59.487]  And on and on and on.
[00:25:59.507 --> 00:26:02.068]  I mean, you're driving around seeing the bumper stickers everywhere.
[00:26:03.189 --> 00:26:07.490]  You hear the people when you're in a restaurant and they don't know that you've got people with you that speak Spanish.
[00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.871]  Take my cousin, Buckley Hammond.
[00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:13.093]  He lives in Chicago now, but he lived in Austin the last five, six years.
[00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:13.753]  Good friend of mine.
[00:26:14.528 --> 00:26:18.171]  He even worked on the main editor on Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror.
[00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:29.219]  And he, when he's dreaming, because I've been on a road trip with him before, and he's in the bed next to me, you know, in the twin bed next to me, and he's speaking in Spanish.
[00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:31.420]  He'll wake up, because he grew up in Guatemala.
[00:26:32.361 --> 00:26:34.022]  And he's a bartender.
[00:26:34.923 --> 00:26:41.908]  And he just sits, you know, and of course, frankly, most of his friends, when he lived here in Austin, he'd live with a bunch of his Hispanic friends who were other DJs.
[00:26:42.541 --> 00:26:45.483]  But so again, he's not against Mexicans or Hispanics.
[00:26:46.784 --> 00:26:52.888]  But to make a long story short, he says, oh yeah, when I'm bartending, he goes, it's probably only 20-30% of the Mexicans.
[00:26:53.429 --> 00:26:55.510]  But they'll walk up and go, look at this scumbag gringo.
[00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.651]  I can't wait till we take over and deal with him.
[00:26:58.252 --> 00:27:00.073]  And he'll just snap back and fluent Spanish.
[00:27:00.113 --> 00:27:01.354]  Hey, what's your problem, racist?
[00:27:01.974 --> 00:27:03.355]  You know, I'm more Latin than you are.
[00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:04.236]  I'm from Guatemala.
[00:27:04.256 --> 00:27:07.878]  And they'll go, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:11.401]  Because again, it's just everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:12.316 --> 00:27:16.024]  It's going on all over the place.
[00:27:17.788 --> 00:27:18.730]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.697]  And it's just like I told you, the professors want to kill 90% of you.
[00:27:23.211 --> 00:27:25.533]  And I say it every broadcast on average.
[00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:27.354]  I'm constantly talking about it.
[00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:38.061]  I give you documents, State Department, CIA, Department of Commerce, World Health Organization, UN Food Program, all these documents.
[00:27:38.261 --> 00:27:45.846]  And I show where they've done it, where they've engineered AIDS, where they've engineered all of this, where they've released it on purpose.
[00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:47.908]  Nobel Prize winners have gone public.
[00:27:48.388 --> 00:27:51.710]  Even that Ed Asner on, he starts bringing up how they want to exterminate the population.
[00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.512]  I mean, anybody in the know knows this.
[00:27:55.353 --> 00:27:58.435]  When you're in the know, and I just got on air and warned you!
[00:27:59.455 --> 00:28:05.659]  Believe me, I found it hard to believe that they got an open plan they're spreading to kill all whites above the age of 16, all white males.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.220]  Plan of San Diego.
[00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:10.963]  But I mean, and then they get on the air, and they lie about it.
[00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:17.067]  People that head up groups that I know are pushing Larry Conquista, I went and checked this lady's organization, and what funds it,
[00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:23.471]  And you go look it up, and they're behind the Lorica Keys, and they'll go around the radio and go, That's made up!
[00:28:23.511 --> 00:28:25.351]  You're making that up, Mr. Jones!
[00:28:25.932 --> 00:28:27.772]  How dare you make that up!
[00:28:27.812 --> 00:28:29.673]  We want to be your friend!
[00:28:30.793 --> 00:28:32.634]  Just wait until Planets in the Eagle!
[00:28:32.654 --> 00:28:35.295]  I mean, it's just like, Hey!
[00:28:35.855 --> 00:28:36.775]  You wanna live in peace?
[00:28:36.855 --> 00:28:37.235]  Fine!
[00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:40.996]  Stop sneaking around, saying you're gonna kill me!
[00:28:41.617 --> 00:28:43.097]  I'm not gonna put up with it!
[00:28:43.557 --> 00:28:44.858]  Do you understand?
[00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:45.858]  Comprende?
[00:28:47.634 --> 00:28:48.034]  Okay?
[00:28:49.215 --> 00:28:49.735]  It's simple.
[00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:53.597]  By the way, we tested this new phone system.
[00:28:53.617 --> 00:28:58.539]  They're someday, over the rainbow, going to get the old one back up and working, the 1-800 lines.
[00:28:59.879 --> 00:29:02.941]  But I've got my own little system here, and I've got to unmute it.
[00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:06.202]  We're running it through the internet to take calls, so there's about a second delay.
[00:29:06.642 --> 00:29:08.003]  So be prepared for that, callers.
[00:29:08.403 --> 00:29:10.984]  And we'll go to Keith, Dan, Randy, Steve, and others.
[00:29:12.765 --> 00:29:14.446]  And we do appreciate everybody out there.
[00:29:14.466 --> 00:29:15.246]  We moved the studios.
[00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:16.087]  They're great new studios.
[00:29:16.127 --> 00:29:16.667]  Sounds better.
[00:29:17.765 --> 00:29:19.286]  I don't know what's going on with the phone company.
[00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:21.448]  Frankly, it's... the computer system's in there.
[00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:22.829]  We'll deal with it.
[00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:32.658]  But, uh, when we come back, I'll take calls, then I'll get into... this professor that says that he wants 90% of us to die, and he gets standing ovations, 95%.
[00:29:33.358 --> 00:29:36.221]  Stand up according to reports and praise him, and just, we all need to die.
[00:29:37.582 --> 00:29:39.844]  And, again, it's just the facts.
[00:29:39.904 --> 00:29:41.645]  I'm just reporting on people that want to kill us.
[00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:43.166]  Simple.
[00:29:43.787 --> 00:29:44.367]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:44.428 --> 00:29:45.589]  I'll continue to expose these people.
[00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:45.949]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.825 --> 00:29:52.726]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:54.788]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.808 --> 00:29:58.432]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.869 --> 00:30:05.173]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:30:05.614 --> 00:30:09.799]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:17.690]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:22.114]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:30:22.494 --> 00:30:35.887]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cost for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:30:36.347 --> 00:30:39.730]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of Stem and Hem.
[00:30:40.131 --> 00:30:44.374]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:30:44.735 --> 00:30:47.657]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:30:47.817 --> 00:30:51.120]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.121]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:31:02.024 --> 00:31:05.607]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.627 --> 00:31:06.148]  are located?
[00:31:06.348 --> 00:31:09.731]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:32:02.805 --> 00:32:05.386]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:05.526 --> 00:32:07.687]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:18.071]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:32:18.371 --> 00:32:20.712]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[00:32:20.892 --> 00:32:24.954]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.

[00:33:07.305 --> 00:33:11.087]  Alright, your calls are coming up here in just a minute or two.
[00:33:11.107 --> 00:33:23.373]  And then I'll get into how the majority of environmental scientists, the majority of biologists, I can say this with total confidence, openly, constantly talk about how they want to kill everybody.
[00:33:24.474 --> 00:33:31.237]  And the University of Texas runs level 4 bio-weapons laboratories with Department of Defense funding.
[00:33:31.597 --> 00:33:32.718]  They have one at Galveston.
[00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:39.551]  They have a Level 3 here in Austin, and I demand the FBI get in there.
[00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:45.512]  I demand they investigate every single one of these graduate students that is in there, that has gone to Bianca's classes.
[00:33:46.353 --> 00:33:50.734]  I demand that they start reading their research papers, but the FBI knows.
[00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:56.795]  Listen, I've been reading these research papers for years, by scientists, by graduate students, where all they talk about is how they want to kill us.
[00:33:57.495 --> 00:34:12.581]  And you've got top biologists, graduates, and undergrads, and PhDs all over the web calling Bianca God, saying he's right, and they're now working in Department of Defense labs, they're working in level 4 labs, level 3 labs, all over the country.
[00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:20.944]  And they've got stuff in these laboratories that makes the bird flu and the Spanish flu look like mother's milk, look like lemonade.
[00:34:21.716 --> 00:34:24.197]  Look like a spoonful of medicine.
[00:34:24.938 --> 00:34:26.038]  And so we're going to get into that.
[00:34:26.298 --> 00:34:28.320]  Listen, do you understand what we're talking about?
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:29.440]  Right now?
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.802]  And don't worry, when the government releases this stuff, it won't be some grad student.
[00:34:33.062 --> 00:34:34.603]  It won't be some biology professor.
[00:34:34.723 --> 00:34:36.424]  They'll blame it on one of these little fruitcakes.
[00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:38.205]  It's going to be the globalists.
[00:34:38.885 --> 00:34:39.105]  Okay?
[00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:40.246]  We're going to get into this later.
[00:34:40.606 --> 00:34:42.427]  David Ray Griffin coming up in 25 minutes.
[00:34:42.927 --> 00:34:44.148]  Before I go to your calls,
[00:34:45.273 --> 00:34:46.674]  I've got to tell you about some great folks.
[00:34:46.694 --> 00:34:49.415]  When was the first time, when was the last time you used Pure Soap?
[00:34:49.455 --> 00:34:59.621]  I mean, hard to find all-natural Pure Soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, chlorides, glycerins, lanolins, weird synthetic vitamins and antibacterials?
[00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:00.342]  Probably never, right?
[00:35:00.622 --> 00:35:10.448]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past, what is it now, 59 years, since 1947, has been making triple-concentrated Pure Soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:14.410]  Now, for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory-direct to you and your family
[00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:20.292]  That's great news because Calvin and Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[00:35:20.632 --> 00:35:24.073]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned Pure Soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:35:24.293 --> 00:35:28.774]  And you can get a free catalog.
[00:35:28.814 --> 00:35:29.314]  Call them right now.
[00:35:29.334 --> 00:35:30.795]  It's a beautiful color catalog.
[00:35:31.565 --> 00:35:36.107]  For $14 you can get their tote bag that's the equivalent of like a $100 value.
[00:35:36.127 --> 00:35:36.928]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:35:37.928 --> 00:35:40.629]  And it's over 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[00:35:40.669 --> 00:35:41.190]  Call today.
[00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.951]  Calbin Pure Soap.
[00:35:43.971 --> 00:35:44.831]  1-800-340-7091.
[00:35:45.212 --> 00:35:45.752]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[00:35:46.052 --> 00:35:49.654]  Or on the web at CalbinPureSoap.com.
[00:35:49.674 --> 00:35:52.235]  That's C-A-L-B-N PureSoap.com.
[00:35:52.255 --> 00:35:53.576]  CalbinPureSoap.com.
[00:35:53.896 --> 00:35:56.737]  Try Pure Soap once and I guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:06.082]  My wife, he sent us another year's supply free a few months ago and I gave it to the staff because we had a year's supply and my wife's already burned through that.
[00:36:06.643 --> 00:36:10.947]  We gave some to some family as well and everybody's ordering and everybody's going crazy over it.
[00:36:12.028 --> 00:36:13.409]  I cannot hype this enough.
[00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:20.195]  It's made out of citrus and out of coconut oil and it's got cherry oil in it.
[00:36:20.396 --> 00:36:21.316]  Oh, the bar soap.
[00:36:21.357 --> 00:36:22.618]  It's just the greatest smell.
[00:36:23.334 --> 00:36:25.196]  They've got shampoo.
[00:36:25.376 --> 00:36:26.597]  They've got conditioners.
[00:36:26.777 --> 00:36:29.079]  They've got lotions.
[00:36:29.179 --> 00:36:30.741]  They've got dishwasher soap.
[00:36:31.101 --> 00:36:33.243]  They've got soap for your clothes.
[00:36:33.623 --> 00:36:34.184]  They've got it all.
[00:36:34.704 --> 00:36:35.985]  And it's 85% off.
[00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:36.826]  It's triple concentrated.
[00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:41.530]  You will save 85% and you won't get toxic chemicals that are very bad for your skin and your family.
[00:36:42.788 --> 00:36:45.269]  So give him a call, or go to www.CalBenPierceHub.com.
[00:36:45.669 --> 00:36:48.510]  Okay, again, the new phone system here, it's got about a second delay.
[00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.710]  The original phone system supposedly was going to be up last week.
[00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.291]  It's not yet, so I'm undoing this IP phone.
[00:36:53.451 --> 00:37:01.414]  Callers can call into it with regular phone lines at 888-234-4564.
[00:37:01.434 --> 00:37:02.294]  888-234-5464.
[00:37:03.234 --> 00:37:06.675]  And let's go ahead and unmute Keith in Ohio.
[00:37:07.195 --> 00:37:08.396]  Keith, you're on the air.
[00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:09.916]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[00:37:10.897 --> 00:37:11.437]  Alright, thank you.
[00:37:11.457 --> 00:37:12.437]  Keep up the good work, Alex.
[00:37:13.627 --> 00:37:24.494]  You know, for a Christian, Matthew 10 talks about we need to not fear them that can kill the body, but Him, that is the Lord, that can destroy both body and soul and hell, you know?
[00:37:24.975 --> 00:37:34.561]  And in Isaiah 8, Isaiah was living in a time similar to ours, and the Lord told him and others not to fear what the people were fearing.
[00:37:35.325 --> 00:37:38.086]  That is, to let God be your fear and let Him be your dread.
[00:37:38.186 --> 00:37:44.508]  Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and so fear of the devil is the beginning of idiocy.
[00:37:45.469 --> 00:37:46.769]  Yeah.
[00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:58.533]  You know, what we're looking at here over the last number of years, and even longer than that, is the forming of this one-world, end-time system, the end-time beast system, going according to the Word of God.
[00:37:58.653 --> 00:38:02.715]  And religion plays a big central part to this.
[00:38:04.144 --> 00:38:11.030]  And believe it or not, you know, the Vatican plays a very central part to what's been happening over the years.
[00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.131]  And there's a couple different authors.
[00:38:13.171 --> 00:38:15.473]  The World's Last Dictator by Dwight Kinman.
[00:38:16.233 --> 00:38:17.935]  That book is loaded with information.
[00:38:18.015 --> 00:38:18.555]  It's solid.
[00:38:18.575 --> 00:38:19.236]  I recommend that.
[00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:21.678]  And also Chick.com.
[00:38:21.698 --> 00:38:26.121]  Chick Publications, The Godfathers, Smokescreens, and books by Rick Jones.
[00:38:26.141 --> 00:38:27.702]  You know, we just need the truth.
[00:38:27.742 --> 00:38:30.244]  We want to love people, but we want them to have the truth.
[00:38:31.741 --> 00:38:34.763]  Well, let me say something about the churches, if I may.
[00:38:35.544 --> 00:38:37.785]  They have been taken over by the Schofield crowd.
[00:38:37.866 --> 00:38:41.808]  They say, lay down, go along, it's not your job to fight it, you're going to get raptured out of here.
[00:38:42.268 --> 00:38:43.529]  Were people raptured with Hitler?
[00:38:43.549 --> 00:38:48.793]  Were they raptured in Rwanda when 800,000 were killed by the Hutus in the UN?
[00:38:50.386 --> 00:38:53.407]  This stuff is going to come down on us, and it's our job to warn people.
[00:38:53.447 --> 00:39:00.371]  And I hear so many so-called Christians calling the talk radio and say, lay down, don't get involved, go along, it's not our job.
[00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:01.852]  And I know you're not saying that.
[00:39:01.892 --> 00:39:03.473]  It is our job to warn people.
[00:39:03.933 --> 00:39:04.793]  Duty is ours.
[00:39:04.853 --> 00:39:06.314]  Consequences belong to God.
[00:39:06.334 --> 00:39:10.456]  It is, as the Founding Fathers said, it is our job to just state the facts as they are.
[00:39:11.357 --> 00:39:11.737]  Exactly.
[00:39:11.777 --> 00:39:13.458]  We want to be active, not passive.
[00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:17.300]  We don't want to be tossed to and fro by the waves and the winds, you know.
[00:39:19.662 --> 00:39:26.289]  I believe a lot can happen even before the tribulation period, just like you mentioned historical examples.
[00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:37.980]  We're talking a lot of apostasy and Christian type religion, but with the Roman system you're looking at a false Christianity, an appearance of Christianity mixed with paganism over the centuries.
[00:39:38.587 --> 00:39:42.528]  And so, you know, you see... Let me ask you a question, sir.
[00:39:42.548 --> 00:39:49.411]  Do you have any comments about Professor Panika and all these people running around saying we've all got to die?
[00:39:50.811 --> 00:39:55.233]  Yeah, that's pretty... I've heard different things like that in the past.
[00:39:56.934 --> 00:40:00.935]  It's just where things are heading, you know, and maybe
[00:40:01.539 --> 00:40:04.943]  He's kind of a diversionary tactic, maybe slightly.
[00:40:05.163 --> 00:40:06.204]  Yeah, we get conditioned to it.
[00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:22.344]  You know, sometimes the enemy hides behind putting out their front men.
[00:40:22.384 --> 00:40:25.987]  So you can attack the front men like a lightning, like a lightning rod, you know?
[00:40:26.007 --> 00:40:31.051]  So they, kind of like the, uh, some of our political leaders, you know, people think that they're invested with so much power.
[00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:33.773]  When the real powers are behind the scene, you never vote them in.
[00:40:33.994 --> 00:40:38.377]  I totally, I totally agree with you, sir, and I really do appreciate your call.
[00:40:38.417 --> 00:40:39.378]  You're absolutely right.
[00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:40.999]  We're going to go ahead and take another call.
[00:40:41.019 --> 00:40:42.861]  I believe this next one is Dan in California.
[00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:46.484]  I may have these mixed up here on the computer screen, but let's go ahead and, uh,
[00:40:47.665 --> 00:40:49.687]  Go ahead and go to Dan.
[00:40:49.747 --> 00:40:50.848]  Dan, are you there, my friend?
[00:40:51.929 --> 00:40:52.830]  I'm here, Alex.
[00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.370]  Can you hear me?
[00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.171]  Yes, sir, I can.
[00:40:54.211 --> 00:40:54.551]  Go ahead.
[00:40:54.571 --> 00:41:00.416]  Okay, I'm on a cell phone, so I try to get it to where I can get the best signal.
[00:41:00.656 --> 00:41:01.257]  That's okay, sir.
[00:41:01.277 --> 00:41:01.797]  Go ahead.
[00:41:02.718 --> 00:41:10.024]  Okay, well, I tell a lot of people about you because you're credible, you know, at least up to this point.
[00:41:10.664 --> 00:41:14.888]  I still think you are, but you had a guest on yesterday, Robert Bowman.
[00:41:15.811 --> 00:41:16.091]  Yes.
[00:41:16.431 --> 00:41:22.575]  And on his website he says that he's an Archbishop of the United Catholic Church, an independent Catholic movement.
[00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:28.959]  And I go to his website and I click on there and he's talking about this United Catholic Church.
[00:41:29.379 --> 00:41:31.040]  And let me read this one paragraph real quick.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.324]  It just says, United Catholic Church includes religious parishes, progressive parishes, everything in between.
[00:41:36.364 --> 00:41:40.246]  You can walk into one of our parishes and hear the trip in Latin.
[00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:51.088]  And then it says, in another you can hear the Novus Ordo Mass, and it will be indistinguishable from what you will experience in most parishes.
[00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:54.229]  And in another you'll find a woman priest and her congregation.
[00:41:54.830 --> 00:42:01.032]  And what binds us together is our Catholic faith, and you know, we're open to ordaining homosexual priests, and we don't care.
[00:42:03.795 --> 00:42:04.995]  Sir, I didn't disconnect you.
[00:42:05.015 --> 00:42:07.216]  Your cell phone dropped there.
[00:42:08.156 --> 00:42:14.078]  Listen, everyone I have on this broadcast, and notice we have two calls in a row talking about Catholics.
[00:42:15.378 --> 00:42:16.819]  There'll probably be five more in a row.
[00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:20.520]  I don't think this is a setup today, but sometimes it is.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.840]  Again, I'm not Catholic, folks.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:28.162]  I'm trying to talk about the New World Order, population control agendas, what the globalists are up to, what they're doing.
[00:42:29.955 --> 00:42:35.618]  And it just gets frustrating that I've laid out all these issues, all these pertinent things that are happening right now.
[00:42:36.218 --> 00:42:39.120]  Mr. Bowman, Dr. Bowman, was the head of the Star Wars program.
[00:42:39.955 --> 00:42:45.579]  Dr. Bowman did fly 101 combat missions over Vietnam as a fighter pilot, and he's highly decorated.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.164]  And as a fighter pilot, and as a pilot, he's saying 9-11 story is impossible and a fable and a fraud.
[00:42:52.704 --> 00:43:03.231]  That's why we have conservatives on, we have liberals on, we have libertarians on, we have people we don't even agree with on, and we have them on to talk about 9-11 and other key issues.
[00:43:04.853 --> 00:43:13.440]  If we ever tried to only interview people on this broadcast we totally agree with, then we would not even have any guests on, because there's no one out there I totally agree with.
[00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:16.883]  I disagree with my beliefs from one month to the next.
[00:43:16.923 --> 00:43:21.046]  My general beliefs are core and stay the same, but I'm always learning more.
[00:43:22.447 --> 00:43:26.811]  So I appreciate your call.
[00:43:28.012 --> 00:43:31.254]  We're going to go ahead now and go to another caller.
[00:43:31.314 --> 00:43:33.096]  I believe this is Dan in California.
[00:43:33.136 --> 00:43:33.856]  Dan, you're on the air.
[00:43:35.711 --> 00:43:37.092]  Yeah, hey Alex, how are you?
[00:43:37.132 --> 00:43:37.533]  Good, sir.
[00:43:38.634 --> 00:43:40.335]  Okay, very good.
[00:43:40.596 --> 00:43:44.960]  Well, the thing is that the U.N.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:54.008]  has this, some of you set up this Georgia Guidestones, and where it talks about they want to depopulate 80% of the people, and they set this up in 1980.
[00:43:57.208 --> 00:44:13.140]  Yes, I meant to put that in the article that Paul and I wrote two days ago about this Professor Pianco saying 90% of us need to die and getting a standing ovation from 95% of those in the audience and we are going to add that in a part two that's coming up today or tomorrow
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.461]  about this, and we've covered the Georgia Guidestones a lot.
[00:44:16.621 --> 00:44:27.246]  A Masonic organization put them up saying this is the Ten Commandments, and the Ten Commandments is actually to reduce the world population to 400 to 500 million, from memory I believe is what it says.
[00:44:27.286 --> 00:44:32.088]  Just type Georgia Guidestones into Google or another search engine and you can see the photos of it.
[00:44:32.568 --> 00:44:34.769]  And yes sir, sir, this is the master plan.
[00:44:34.789 --> 00:44:36.390]  This is all these people talk about.
[00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:40.032]  Their religion's sacrament is killing 80 to 95 percent of us.
[00:44:44.468 --> 00:44:45.609]  Does that answer your question, sir?
[00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:52.352]  I can hear you there, but he's still there.
[00:44:52.412 --> 00:44:53.153]  He's just not talking.
[00:44:55.254 --> 00:44:59.977]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and kick that caller then.
[00:45:01.057 --> 00:45:06.480]  Let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Colorado, I believe.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.262]  There's so many calls coming in here on this phone system.
[00:45:09.322 --> 00:45:11.323]  I guess this thing can take like 20 calls.
[00:45:11.343 --> 00:45:13.204]  I don't even know which one I'm on.
[00:45:14.255 --> 00:45:15.656]  So I'll try it from the bottom up.
[00:45:15.756 --> 00:45:16.396]  That sounds better.
[00:45:16.436 --> 00:45:18.297]  New phone system I'm here getting used to.
[00:45:18.317 --> 00:45:19.657]  Let's go to Jonathan.
[00:45:20.658 --> 00:45:26.781]  Jonathan in, I believe, in California is up next.
[00:45:26.841 --> 00:45:27.761]  Go ahead, Jonathan.
[00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:28.381]  You're on the air.
[00:45:29.602 --> 00:45:30.362]  Hello, Jonathan.
[00:45:30.422 --> 00:45:30.782]  Welcome.
[00:45:34.784 --> 00:45:35.144]  Okay.
[00:45:35.585 --> 00:45:36.145]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:40.871]  This is what I've been forced to do is go to this phone system, folks.
[00:45:41.451 --> 00:45:43.212]  I'm gonna put him, uh... Hello?
[00:45:43.252 --> 00:45:44.552]  Yes, yes, Jonathan, go ahead.
[00:45:45.353 --> 00:45:48.094]  Okay, do you know how many, how many square feet are in a mile?
[00:45:49.334 --> 00:45:57.097]  You know, I don't have that in front of me, but I know the calculations are you could give each person on Earth, uh, a acre, and... And do you know where I'm getting at?
[00:45:57.458 --> 00:46:00.259]  Let me just stop, and, and, and put him into the state of Texas.
[00:46:02.039 --> 00:46:05.841]  There's 20, well, rounded that up, 28 million, uh, square feet in a mile.
[00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:10.208]  So in a thousand miles, you've got 2,800,000,000 square feet.
[00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:15.172]  And that's... I was just doing a study on my county, Nevada County, which is a thousand miles.
[00:46:15.612 --> 00:46:19.175]  You get yourself something like Fresno, that's 168,000,000,000 square feet.
[00:46:19.315 --> 00:46:24.079]  These people have got to look at the numbers.
[00:46:24.839 --> 00:46:25.620]  There's plenty of room.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:29.143]  This overpopulation is just a bunch of propaganda and I'm tired of it.
[00:46:29.946 --> 00:46:34.190]  Well, sir, what it is is a pretext and an excuse to devalue human life.
[00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:56.790]  The radical animal rights people are funded by the big banks and the big foundations of the universities, because then they can say, well, animals have the same rights as you, and the government represents the animals, so the animals' rights outweigh your rights, or you could say outvote your rights, and so we are all as valuable as bacteria, as Professor Pianka and Professor Peter Singer
[00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.772]  And others have said, and so we're going to have to get rid of you.
[00:47:00.792 --> 00:47:09.475]  In fact, he's an expert on his site in corralling human populations, he says, and environmental buffer zones, and putting us into compact cities.
[00:47:09.876 --> 00:47:13.277]  A prison planet in the name of saving the Earth.
[00:47:13.597 --> 00:47:22.701]  This is the excuse of the globalists to bring in an incredible tyranny, and they've propagandized millions of students and graduate students to be adherents to this modern death cult.
[00:47:23.782 --> 00:47:25.222]  It's indoctrination.
[00:47:25.242 --> 00:47:26.803]  That's all public school is anymore.
[00:47:27.395 --> 00:47:28.336]  Indoctrination.
[00:47:28.356 --> 00:47:29.798]  But I just want to put the numbers out there.
[00:47:29.818 --> 00:47:33.343]  There's plenty of room for us, the animals, the fish.
[00:47:33.383 --> 00:47:35.346]  It's a bunch of bollocks.
[00:47:36.768 --> 00:47:37.429]  You're right, sir.
[00:47:37.489 --> 00:47:39.632]  And I appreciate your call.
[00:47:40.353 --> 00:47:41.454]  You're absolutely right.
[00:47:41.494 --> 00:47:41.955]  Let's go to...
[00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.914]  I'm told this next caller is Steve Mason, who I know personally.
[00:47:46.934 --> 00:47:47.835]  I hope I got the right one here.
[00:47:49.036 --> 00:48:00.849]  And Steve is a local activist who exposes the open borders, and who has given me some of the audio and videotapes of the mayor saying that they are the master race, and this is Oslon, three years ago, outgoing mayor.
[00:48:01.926 --> 00:48:11.614]  And of course, his name was Gus Garcia, and then he gave me the Gutierrez tape where he said we've got to kill all the whites, implement the plan of San Diego, and now that's back in the news today.
[00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:19.720]  So, right now, let's go ahead and speak to Steve Mason.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.701]  I believe this is Steve.
[00:48:21.222 --> 00:48:22.743]  Steve, thank you for calling.
[00:48:22.763 --> 00:48:23.483]  What's on your mind?
[00:48:24.324 --> 00:48:25.085]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:48:25.145 --> 00:48:30.209]  I first wanted to alert everybody to the reckoning up in Crawford, Texas on May 6th.
[00:48:31.226 --> 00:48:34.251]  Where they're going to go protest against Bush's open border policies.
[00:48:35.192 --> 00:48:38.517]  And you can find that at www.areckoning.com
[00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:45.301]  Alex, you know they're going to have another pro-illegal march tomorrow, on Monday, this coming Monday?
[00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:50.825]  I knew that, and I'm going to be out of town just for Monday, but let me just bring this up to you, Steve.
[00:48:50.865 --> 00:49:06.876]  You were there at the Mexican Independence Day parade, where they were calling us gringos and telling us to leave, and they had their t-shirts on saying, all whites above age 16 who are male must die, and is this a minority view with the illegal lobby, or is this a majority view?
[00:49:09.774 --> 00:49:13.456]  The people who are outspoken about it, of course, are a minor view.
[00:49:14.036 --> 00:49:18.078]  But, of course, the majority will always tell you, oh, they don't agree with it.
[00:49:18.118 --> 00:49:21.799]  But it seems to me that birds of a feather flock together, if you know what I mean.
[00:49:21.979 --> 00:49:24.480]  Well, I mean, it's the leaders of the movement.
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.201]  It's the dominant forces.
[00:49:26.561 --> 00:49:28.902]  And they're on the extreme saying you all must die.
[00:49:29.202 --> 00:49:33.144]  But then the majority of the illegal lobby just says, no, you've just got to go back to Europe.
[00:49:34.484 --> 00:49:35.345]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:35.825 --> 00:49:37.245]  Well, I mean, do you agree with that?
[00:49:37.285 --> 00:49:38.446]  Because you're an expert on this.
[00:49:39.301 --> 00:49:40.302]  Yes, I agree with you.
[00:49:40.682 --> 00:49:41.362]  I agree with you.
[00:49:41.382 --> 00:49:52.688]  I think this Ocelot stuff and Kill the Gringo and I think we cleansed Whitey out is part and parcel of the warp and weave of the Chicano movement.
[00:49:54.468 --> 00:50:04.653]  And I don't know if you read in the paper about the Cesar Chavez march this weekend and heard what Susana Almanza from Poder had to say?
[00:50:04.954 --> 00:50:07.535]  No, I heard about the march but not her.
[00:50:07.575 --> 00:50:07.915]  What happened?
[00:50:09.036 --> 00:50:11.157]  Oh, well, you know, she's an Aztec supremacist.
[00:50:12.078 --> 00:50:14.659]  She was put on the planning commission in the city of Austin.
[00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:15.919]  She's a former Brown Beret.
[00:50:18.001 --> 00:50:25.744]  She was talking about that we shouldn't be allowed to pass laws against her people because this is a continent.
[00:50:26.405 --> 00:50:27.425]  This is all one continent.
[00:50:27.505 --> 00:50:30.147]  Oh, yeah, I mean, about half the signs say this is our continent.
[00:50:30.207 --> 00:50:30.507]  Leave.
[00:50:31.901 --> 00:50:32.481]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:32.561 --> 00:50:34.202]  And so they're totally racialized.
[00:50:34.342 --> 00:50:38.104]  And she was a featured speaker for it, along with Lloyd Doggett up there.
[00:50:38.784 --> 00:50:39.785]  Oh, I know.
[00:50:41.245 --> 00:50:46.748]  When their leaders are brown supremacists, and our congressman marches with them, then it is brown supremacy.
[00:50:47.488 --> 00:50:48.248]  All right, Steve.
[00:50:48.288 --> 00:50:49.869]  Always good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:50:49.949 --> 00:50:50.629]  I appreciate it.
[00:50:50.649 --> 00:50:51.530]  We'll take some more calls.
[00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:52.470]  This is working pretty good.
[00:50:53.491 --> 00:50:56.612]  I guess this thing can take like 10, 15 lines.
[00:50:56.712 --> 00:50:57.232]  I don't know.
[00:50:57.252 --> 00:50:59.393]  So we'll just keep plowing through your calls.
[00:51:02.873 --> 00:51:05.734]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.

[00:51:25.101 --> 00:51:29.763]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[00:54:21.551 --> 00:54:22.673]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[00:54:26.598 --> 00:54:30.222]  Professor David Ray Griffin joins us coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:31.103 --> 00:54:33.226]  I want to get more into this professor saying we all have to die.
[00:54:33.987 --> 00:54:36.430]  This other one in more detail is very important.
[00:54:37.722 --> 00:54:47.846]  But we've extended the deal that we were going to have in March where you get five plus months free, almost half a year free, when you go sign up for a yearly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:23.925]  And then it will be gone.
[00:55:25.406 --> 00:55:27.587]  We're getting rid of that deal early next week.

[00:55:51.337 --> 00:55:53.278]  We're going to go ahead now and talk to Anita.
[00:55:53.298 --> 00:55:54.958]  And Anita, you're on the air.
[00:55:55.078 --> 00:55:55.418]  Welcome.
[00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:55.718]  Hi Alex.
[00:55:55.738 --> 00:55:55.778]  Hi.
[00:55:56.318 --> 00:55:57.378]  I hope this is still pertinent.
[00:56:11.958 --> 00:56:40.005]  While you were gone off the air, Lou Dobbs came on and they were talking about 9-1-1 and they had this man who was supposedly the shadow conspirator who had trained the men who were on the plane that flew into the tower and how they couldn't find him but that supposedly he was killed during the first round of battle over in Iraq.
[00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:43.547]  Sure, yeah.
[00:56:43.607 --> 00:56:55.151]  Well, it's like in Ohio, they bust a group of, quote, terrorists, and then it turns out that a government agent, special forces Arab, you know, from the U.S.
[00:56:55.191 --> 00:56:58.892]  military, is their, quote, handler, the unnamed conspirator.
[00:56:59.172 --> 00:57:03.814]  So they go set these patsies up to create the illusion that there's really domestic terrorists.
[00:57:05.034 --> 00:57:05.335]  Right.
[00:57:05.375 --> 00:57:07.155]  Sounds like chalk one up for Alex.
[00:57:07.195 --> 00:57:07.655]  Good job.
[00:57:10.018 --> 00:57:11.559]  Well, it's the same story all the time.
[00:57:11.579 --> 00:57:12.960]  I mean, they have the same M.O., Anita.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:17.323]  I'm just doing my job, and I appreciate your support, and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:17.744 --> 00:57:19.305]  Now, let's try to jam one more in here.
[00:57:19.345 --> 00:57:20.966]  Let's talk to Scott in California.
[00:57:21.066 --> 00:57:22.767]  Scott, you're on the air, sir.
[00:57:22.827 --> 00:57:23.187]  Welcome.
[00:57:24.448 --> 00:57:25.669]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:57:25.889 --> 00:57:28.111]  Boy, yesterday's broadcast was amazing.
[00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:29.192]  Those two interviews.
[00:57:29.632 --> 00:57:35.036]  We've now got a smoking gun about this population control agenda, or what I would call mass murder.
[00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:45.275]  Boy, and we've got such a great list of 9-11 whistleblowers now between British members, former members of government, German, various Americans.
[00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:46.837]  You've got such an amazing list.
[00:57:47.738 --> 00:57:54.364]  Let me tell your listeners, you really need to go to prisonplanet.tv and get a membership because these interviews are all posted.
[00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:57.708]  If you missed the interviews from yesterday with, what was his name, Mims?
[00:57:58.188 --> 00:57:58.429]  Yes.
[00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:04.663]  Yeah, about the population control thing, or the other individual who's 9-11 whistleblower.
[00:58:04.683 --> 00:58:05.944]  What was his name, Alex?
[00:58:06.024 --> 00:58:08.264]  Former head of Star Wars, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:11.225]  We also had the chairman, Mims.
[00:58:13.126 --> 00:58:13.866]  Yeah, amazing.
[00:58:13.926 --> 00:58:14.646]  So credible.
[00:58:15.246 --> 00:58:16.487]  Credible sources.
[00:58:16.587 --> 00:58:25.029]  And Alex, let me say, I hear the music so I've got to rush, but I've been kind of sitting here observing things, and after yesterday, I'm going active.
[00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:26.409]  I can't just sit here on my desk.
[00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.190]  I'm going to launch a big project.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.683]  If you would let me, after the break, give out my email address to your listeners, I need some volunteers.
[00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:39.546]  Yeah, we can't do that because we've got the professor joining us, but start a website and we'll plug it.
[00:58:41.847 --> 00:58:46.149]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.169 --> 00:59:02.351]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.991 --> 00:59:03.811]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.571 --> 00:59:05.472]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.132 --> 00:59:09.753]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.314 --> 00:59:14.395]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:26.442 --> 00:59:26.962]  All right!
[00:59:29.903 --> 00:59:32.084]  Now into hour number dose.
[00:59:32.725 --> 00:59:33.285]  Second hour.
[00:59:34.306 --> 00:59:41.349]  Coming up in the next segment, we're scheduled to have Professor Dr. David Ray Griffin joining us.
[00:59:41.749 --> 00:59:43.230]  Best-selling author on 9-11.
[00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:44.090]  Very astute.
[00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.491]  Able to wake up a lot of people.
[00:59:46.244 --> 00:59:49.125]  We're here with a big tent to promote him and promote what he's doing.
[00:59:49.145 --> 00:59:54.967]  He just had a sold-out crowd in San Francisco there exposing the myth of 9-11.
[00:59:54.987 --> 00:59:58.328]  We've got links to that up on InfoWars.com, an MP3 of that.
[00:59:58.388 --> 01:00:02.670]  But he'll be joining us with another newsmaker interview here today.
[01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:11.793]  Another one of the credible whistleblowers and people exposing government complicity in 9-11, running the attacks as a pretext for global empire.
[01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:19.115]  And we will continue to take calls throughout the broadcast today as well on a new number for now, 888-234-5464, 888-234-5464, 888-234-5464,
[01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:43.045]  And we will certainly get you up and on the air as well.
[01:00:43.065 --> 01:00:48.807]  And then later, I want to spend some time on the headline, Scientists Cheers Holocaust Wish, from right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:49.467 --> 01:00:56.449]  He gave a speech last weekend saying it again, and he gave a speech a month ago to the Texas Academy of Scientists saying it, and it's not based in science.
[01:00:57.009 --> 01:01:00.271]  And he got off on it, according to the professors and others we've talked to that witnessed it.
[01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:09.355]  Ninety-five percent of the professors and scientists and students and graduate students got up to a rousing applause, a standing ovation, and went on and on.
[01:01:10.356 --> 01:01:14.438]  And this is an elite mentality, an elite philosophy, and we're going to be exposing it.
[01:01:15.618 --> 01:01:20.060]  It's even crept into the 9-11 Truth Movement, people pushing these Malthusian social Darwinistic views.
[01:01:20.181 --> 01:01:20.941]  Very destructive.
[01:01:22.339 --> 01:01:27.503]  I am honored to now be joined by Professor David Ray Griffin, best-selling author.
[01:01:28.223 --> 01:01:29.604]  We'll tell you about those books as well.
[01:01:30.325 --> 01:01:32.887]  And it is good to have you on with us today, sir.
[01:01:34.268 --> 01:01:34.988]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:01:35.068 --> 01:01:36.049]  Good to be back with you.
[01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.589]  You bet.
[01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:37.270]  We're about to break.
[01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:40.952]  When we come back, I want to get into how things went over the weekend in San Francisco.
[01:01:40.972 --> 01:01:41.793]  You're very successful.
[01:01:43.121 --> 01:01:44.221]  How did it go in San Francisco?
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.720]  Oh, quite well.
[01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:14.703]  All three events that I spoke for were sold out.
[01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:21.446]  The one, they had a capacity of 600 and I guess they turned away 50 or more.
[01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:23.827]  So, it's very encouraging.
[01:02:23.887 --> 01:02:35.913]  It shows that there's a growing movement of people out there who are interested in this, you know, interested enough to come out on a rainy night and
[01:02:37.807 --> 01:02:41.989]  There's an enormous amount of interest and enthusiasm about it.
[01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:50.032]  I also spoke for the Democratic World Federalists and then at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.
[01:02:51.192 --> 01:02:56.214]  And again, they said they had the biggest audiences they had had in some time.
[01:02:58.415 --> 01:02:59.335]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.456]  What did you title your speech in San Francisco?
[01:03:01.496 --> 01:03:04.157]  Wasn't it something like the 9-11 hoax or fraud?
[01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:09.459]  Uh, all three of them were called, uh, 9-11, the myth, and the reality.
[01:03:09.639 --> 01:03:10.999]  Ah, yes, the myth and the reality.
[01:03:11.059 --> 01:03:11.540]  I saw that.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:11.820]  Yeah.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.401]  Saw that on some of the sites, and I believe we have a link to that MP3.
[01:03:14.781 --> 01:03:31.771]  Yeah, what I stressed was that myth is used in, in various ways, and our ordinary use of it is, just means something that's false, but also it's, uh, you know, a religious myth serves as a sacred story, and that's what 9-11 has done.
[01:03:32.471 --> 01:03:33.912]  A sacred fable.
[01:03:35.485 --> 01:03:37.847]  A new religion of the police state.
[01:03:39.008 --> 01:03:42.330]  A new religion delivering us into the hands of neo-fascism.
[01:03:44.032 --> 01:03:45.533]  Professor David Ray Griffin is our guest.
[01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:47.614]  We'll be back in just three short minutes.
[01:03:47.654 --> 01:03:48.515]  Important messages.
[01:03:49.336 --> 01:03:50.056]  So stay with us.
[01:03:50.396 --> 01:03:51.097]  Strap yourselves in.
[01:03:53.624 --> 01:03:55.166]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.306 --> 01:03:58.389]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.529 --> 01:04:02.454]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.494 --> 01:04:06.718]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:07.079 --> 01:04:10.843]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.983 --> 01:04:12.705]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.965 --> 01:04:16.267]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.307 --> 01:04:21.029]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.189 --> 01:04:24.230]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:27.252]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.752 --> 01:04:33.875]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.395 --> 01:04:38.200]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:39.983]  Order your video today.
[01:04:40.383 --> 01:04:41.364]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:04:41.424 --> 01:04:43.667]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.727 --> 01:04:44.969]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:53.059 --> 01:04:56.320]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:00.562]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.822 --> 01:05:03.603]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.783 --> 01:05:06.184]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.384 --> 01:05:15.028]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.208 --> 01:05:16.568]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:16.768 --> 01:05:20.930]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.030]  We're good to go!
[01:05:50.057 --> 01:05:51.717]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:52.718 --> 01:05:54.218]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:05:54.538 --> 01:05:58.499]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:05:58.879 --> 01:06:02.400]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:06:02.781 --> 01:06:06.321]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[01:06:06.722 --> 01:06:11.583]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:06:11.923 --> 01:06:17.705]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:06:18.025 --> 01:06:21.726]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[01:06:22.086 --> 01:06:24.167]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:06:24.507 --> 01:06:30.249]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:06:30.689 --> 01:06:31.869]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:33.289]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:38.810]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:42.471]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:06:42.751 --> 01:06:44.171]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:06:44.211 --> 01:06:44.431]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:06:44.451 --> 01:06:45.412]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.612 --> 01:06:47.452]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.054 --> 01:07:03.556]  War on Corruption.
[01:07:03.716 --> 01:07:06.299]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.822]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 p.m.
[01:07:08.842 --> 01:07:09.223]  Central.
[01:07:09.243 --> 01:07:10.124]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[01:07:11.586 --> 01:07:14.169]  On the Ragtag GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:15.502 --> 01:07:17.423]  And we will be taking your calls later in this hour.
[01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:22.244]  Sean, Chris, Doug, Fred, and many, many others.
[01:07:22.445 --> 01:07:33.028]  And the toll-free call-in number at this time, while we're getting the old phone system in order, and the gremlins have attacked it, is 888-234-4564.
[01:07:33.889 --> 01:07:38.990]  And this new phone system can take even more calls, so... I think we had, like, 12 of them lined up earlier.
[01:07:39.451 --> 01:07:40.211]  Okay, um...
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:51.388]  Well, Professor David Ray Griffin, I know some of you don't know who he is, most of you do, but Professor, before we get into 9-11, just for people who don't know who you are, tell us about yourself and then tell us how you woke up to 9-11.
[01:07:51.428 --> 01:07:59.255]  I saw a story, a positive one, the San Francisco Chronicle, with the headline, out loud, an inside job.
[01:08:00.183 --> 01:08:05.426]  And the San Francisco Chronicle just came right out and said you're very credible and they're saying it's an inside job.
[01:08:05.727 --> 01:08:12.111]  By the way, the San Francisco Chronicle, I didn't mention this, wrote an article saying Infowars.com is right and calling us a watchdog yesterday.
[01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:13.391]  I just learned of this article.
[01:08:13.411 --> 01:08:15.152]  I don't know if we posted it.
[01:08:15.172 --> 01:08:16.253]  I think I gave it to my webmaster.
[01:08:16.273 --> 01:08:19.195]  She's saying we're right about MySpace censoring people.
[01:08:19.555 --> 01:08:22.377]  You know, deleting 200,000 profiles, hate speech, and all the rest of this.
[01:08:22.397 --> 01:08:23.678]  So that's coming up later.
[01:08:24.557 --> 01:08:38.702]  Professor, tell us about yourself and your awakening so we can compare it to other people's awakenings, and then I want to talk about some of the other whistleblowers, and then your particular approach to 9-11 and why it's been so effective with your scholarly approach to waking people up.
[01:08:41.583 --> 01:08:47.426]  Well, my background, I've been a philosophy of religion and theology professor.
[01:08:48.406 --> 01:08:52.007]  I had gotten interested in the last 10-15 years of my
[01:08:54.605 --> 01:09:05.328]  ...teaching career in the questions of global politics and then after 9-11 I started writing a book on U.S.
[01:09:05.388 --> 01:09:13.450]  imperialism because I had originally accepted the blowback thesis that 9-11 was a blowback from U.S.
[01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:16.571]  foreign policy that most Americans didn't know about.
[01:09:18.492 --> 01:09:21.013]  But then about a year and a half in I
[01:09:22.543 --> 01:09:35.347]  People saw that this was, like many other incidents, a false flag operation to promote our entry into a war, in this case, a self-declared war on terrorism.
[01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.368]  Now, describe that awakening.
[01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:46.430]  Do you remember the moment when you just had seen so much evidence that it clicked, or was it more incremental?
[01:09:47.248 --> 01:09:49.410]  Oh, uh, yeah, it was very definite.
[01:09:49.530 --> 01:09:57.376]  It was after a colleague had sent the, uh, a website that had Paul Thompson's timeline.
[01:09:57.996 --> 01:10:12.807]  Um, there's a 200 and page, what at that time was a 200 single page, uh, timeline giving all sorts of stories from the strictly mainstream press that contradicted the official story.
[01:10:13.632 --> 01:10:24.202]  So, if I recall correctly, it was only a couple hours into that that I saw that the official story most likely was false.
[01:10:25.524 --> 01:10:35.952]  I've found that's very effective, the different 100 smoking guns, 200 smoking guns, 20 smoking guns, there's all these different articles out there that just list mainstream what is available.
[01:10:36.352 --> 01:10:45.059]  If you can, for people to just join us, go through your four different views, there's four different ways to historically look at this from different perspectives.
[01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:50.183]  Let's see, that was some time back that I gave that.
[01:10:51.374 --> 01:11:07.843]  lecture, certainly there's the official theory that this was an attack by foreign terrorists, and therefore, in order to protect ourselves, we had to launch this war on terror.
[01:11:08.043 --> 01:11:17.168]  Other people believe that, yeah, that was true, but that we lied about some of the details, and certainly particularly lied about Iraq.
[01:11:18.277 --> 01:11:27.880]  In order to justify a response that was completely disproportionate to the cause, and in some cases had no relation.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:35.882]  So, that would be the view of many of the... much of the left who hold that view.
[01:11:37.403 --> 01:11:44.885]  Certainly a third view is that the government knew it was coming, but deliberately
[01:11:46.197 --> 01:11:48.898]  Let it happen, and then perhaps joined in.
[01:11:48.998 --> 01:12:03.384]  So, for example, perhaps Al-Qaeda really did organize the attack on the World Trade Center, but of course they couldn't have made the buildings come down so that our own agents placed the explosives in there.
[01:12:03.404 --> 01:12:09.806]  And then, of course, the force theory is that our people were orchestrating the whole thing.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:19.263]  Now, you've said on this broadcast that you believe only number four fits the facts, and I concur.
[01:12:20.223 --> 01:12:27.546]  Well, that's right, and for many people it's more comfortable to think about, well, maybe we just allowed it to happen.
[01:12:28.206 --> 01:12:35.368]  It seems more evil to orchestrate the whole thing, but really it doesn't make much difference in terms of the level of evil involved.
[01:12:36.049 --> 01:12:39.230]  And when you start looking at the details, you realize that
[01:12:40.327 --> 01:12:45.550]  The let-it-happen position just doesn't fit so many of the facts.
[01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:51.314]  Like, how did Al-Qaeda defeat the most sophisticated defense system in history?
[01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:56.057]  They could not have carried off even the attack on the World Trade Center.
[01:12:56.597 --> 01:13:08.244]  When you see Bush's behavior at the school, obviously the lead Secret Service agent had to know that that schoolhouse was not going to be a target, or they would have been out of there immediately, and so on and so on.
[01:13:10.037 --> 01:13:13.659]  And then you clearly have the bomb blast points going off in all three of the buildings.
[01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:15.460]  Building 7, Sterling, for example.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.521]  You have the public officials warned not to fly.
[01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:18.302]  It goes on and on.
[01:13:19.422 --> 01:13:19.983]  That's right.
[01:13:20.163 --> 01:13:20.703]  That's right.
[01:13:20.883 --> 01:13:24.205]  So... And then we have things like Northwoods, where the U.S.
[01:13:24.225 --> 01:13:31.949]  government says, we can stage our agents getting on planes, have that land somewhere else, fly a drone, blow it up, and claim young people are on board.
[01:13:32.289 --> 01:13:34.891]  That'll cause a helpful wave of national indignation.
[01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:35.311]  I think?
[01:13:52.572 --> 01:13:55.974]  Yeah, and in my recent lecture I laid out a lot of this background information.
[01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:22.225]  It seemed like it was helpful to people to hear that before they got into the details about the World Trade Center.
[01:14:22.245 --> 01:14:27.306]  I don't know if you've seen my films, but that's what I do in Road to Tyranny.
[01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:28.707]  That's what I do in Martial Law.
[01:14:28.927 --> 01:14:32.128]  That's what I did in my little book, and of course I was the first to cover this.
[01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:39.811]  I'm not tooting my horn, I just organically went from the position of, hey look, they admit they've done it all these times, so why are you shocked now?
[01:14:41.246 --> 01:14:57.120]  That's right, and I find that the two a priori arguments that keep people from looking at the evidence, one is this view that such a big conspiracy could not be kept secret.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:02.444]  And again, if people knew the history of big operations, they would know that is not true.
[01:15:02.725 --> 01:15:05.527]  Many, many big operations have been kept a secret.
[01:15:05.987 --> 01:15:09.010]  Nobody has come forward who was on the inside and talked.
[01:15:09.696 --> 01:15:13.237]  And the other one is simply that we wouldn't do such a thing.
[01:15:13.918 --> 01:15:24.181]  And again, if people knew our own history of false flag operations and terrorist campaigns, they would realize that a priori argument doesn't work either.
[01:15:24.201 --> 01:15:30.744]  And so you have to look at the evidence in this particular case and say, did they do it again?
[01:15:31.713 --> 01:15:40.476]  Exactly, and I would add the caveat that big operations do go public, but the whistleblowers get ignored because the media is owned and no one ever learns of it.
[01:15:41.757 --> 01:15:51.421]  Yeah, I asked yesterday at the Commonwealth Club if anybody there knew about the war that we started in Indonesia in 1957, a full-scale civil war.
[01:15:57.805 --> 01:15:58.626]  Nobody had.
[01:15:59.386 --> 01:16:01.127]  It hadn't even been revealed until 1995.
[01:16:01.187 --> 01:16:08.492]  Well, the average American doesn't even know that we've got tens of thousands of troops in a full-scale war in Colombia right now.
[01:16:09.372 --> 01:16:09.933]  That's right.
[01:16:10.593 --> 01:16:14.496]  So these things can be kept secret, at least from the American public.
[01:16:16.237 --> 01:16:18.878]  You were trying to finish up with Indonesia when I interrupted.
[01:16:19.239 --> 01:16:20.039]  Well, that's right.
[01:16:20.079 --> 01:16:24.462]  I mean, this is pretty amazing to think that nothing came out in public
[01:16:25.445 --> 01:16:36.202]  Between 1957 and 1995 when George and Audrey Cahan published the book called Subversion as Foreign Policy and still
[01:16:37.449 --> 01:16:44.452]  Most Americans have not heard of that, so they don't realize that there was a huge operation that was kept secret for several decades.
[01:16:44.572 --> 01:16:52.255]  Well, basically, you have academics and you have independent researchers who've been cloistered because of mainstream media compartmentalization.
[01:16:52.295 --> 01:16:53.575]  We've never gotten out to the people.
[01:16:53.695 --> 01:16:55.556]  Now that dam has broken.
[01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:57.117]  Do you agree the dam has broken?
[01:16:58.257 --> 01:16:59.197]  I think it has.
[01:16:59.817 --> 01:17:02.118]  One big factor was the rise of this
[01:17:04.418 --> 01:17:07.739]  There's an organization called Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[01:17:08.539 --> 01:17:22.303]  So, you know, just a while ago, people could ridicule the movement, say it's a bunch of crazies on the internet, and a few people with talk shows, and, you know, a theologian.
[01:17:23.543 --> 01:17:29.245]  And now there are, what, 60 or 70 full members.
[01:17:29.285 --> 01:17:32.326]  That means, I believe in all cases, people with PhDs.
[01:17:33.069 --> 01:17:41.676]  who have joined this movement and we have a, you know, they're now mechanical engineers and all the disciplines that are needed.
[01:17:41.696 --> 01:17:44.238]  Physicists, structural engineers.
[01:17:44.798 --> 01:17:45.299]  That's right.
[01:17:45.919 --> 01:17:52.444]  And so it cannot be ridiculed anymore as something that only a bunch of crazies believe.
[01:17:53.425 --> 01:18:00.551]  And then the fact, you mentioned Charlie Sheen, the fact that there's this breakthrough that you helped instigate.
[01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:03.536]  Uh, that got national media attention.
[01:18:04.276 --> 01:18:22.564]  And, uh, the, you know, as soon as people become aware that these things are being talked about, and look into them, they can see rather immediately, uh, you know, as long as they don't have these a priori blinders on, they can see rather immediately that the official story, uh, just doesn't make sense.
[01:18:22.604 --> 01:18:28.267]  Like, Charlie particularly stressed Building 7, and, uh, that is probably one of the
[01:18:28.806 --> 01:18:31.548]  The clearest example is that it had to be an inside job.
[01:18:32.668 --> 01:18:34.329]  Stay there, riveting information.
[01:18:34.369 --> 01:18:41.573]  We'll continue to talk about this breakthrough that's happened and where David Ray Griffin, Professor David Ray Griffin, believes this is going in the future.
[01:18:42.214 --> 01:18:43.314]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:18:43.394 --> 01:18:44.675]  It's the Genesis Network.
[01:18:45.335 --> 01:18:47.797]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:18:47.877 --> 01:18:49.498]  We'll tell you about his websites and his books.
[01:18:54.412 --> 01:18:57.395]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:18:57.755 --> 01:19:06.584]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:19:06.904 --> 01:19:11.589]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:12.049 --> 01:19:18.773]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:19.174 --> 01:19:30.961]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:31.421 --> 01:19:35.886]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:19:36.067 --> 01:19:38.369]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:38.389 --> 01:19:40.372]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:56.821]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:19:57.241 --> 01:20:01.583]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:07.666]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:20:07.906 --> 01:20:11.947]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:20:12.248 --> 01:20:17.270]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:18.390]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:20:22.712 --> 01:20:26.615]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.036]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:20:29.377 --> 01:20:31.678]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:20:32.058 --> 01:20:35.701]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:20:36.161 --> 01:20:42.365]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:43.786]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:20:44.126 --> 01:20:44.466]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:20:55.561 --> 01:20:57.202]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:57.823 --> 01:20:59.604]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:00.745 --> 01:21:08.632]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:21:08.872 --> 01:21:11.494]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:21:11.474 --> 01:21:12.895]  's patented methodology.

[01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:55.276]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.376 --> 01:22:00.719]  Did you know executive orders and other laws have already been passed that can create a legal dictatorship in America?
[01:22:01.239 --> 01:22:18.187]  These laws can affect you by seizing all communication media, all electric power, fuel, minerals, food supplies, and resources, all farms and farm equipment, all means of transportation, including personal vehicles, total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.
[01:22:18.728 --> 01:22:21.249]  Seize all American people for workforces.
[01:22:22.169 --> 01:22:24.550]  These laws extend to all parts of our life.
[01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:32.773]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:59.226 --> 01:23:04.011]  Defending the human species from psychopaths that have gotten control of our society.
[01:23:04.411 --> 01:23:09.496]  And I am a student of history, a layman, but that is what I have done for entertainment for decades.
[01:23:09.777 --> 01:23:12.780]  I find history to be much more riveting than fiction.
[01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:22.069]  And I don't know of governments or empires or societies where evil people didn't normally get into control, where despotism and subterfuge wasn't the norm.
[01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:33.014]  Professor David Ray Griffin, best-selling author, one of the leaders in the 9-11 scholar movement, in fact, the founder, I would venture to say, of that movement.
[01:23:34.115 --> 01:23:39.557]  One of the first prominent people in the vanguard of that second wave we saw three years ago.
[01:23:42.208 --> 01:23:53.533]  From your study of history, and I know you've studied history quite a bit, I mean, was my previous statement false, or is tyranny the normal ether, and liberty a rare, delicate flower?
[01:23:55.093 --> 01:24:06.478]  Well, that's certainly the case, and, you know, we have this saying from Ben Franklin, you know, what do we have here, a republic if you can keep it.
[01:24:07.348 --> 01:24:16.414]  And it is very hard to keep it, and of course now we have people who deliberately don't want it to be kept.
[01:24:17.315 --> 01:24:34.507]  And unfortunately, in the meantime, they co-opted the Fourth Estate so that the mainstream media, which we would assume would be protesting all these incursions on civil rights,
[01:24:35.459 --> 01:24:41.001]  And all these violations of international law are, for the most part, remaining silent.
[01:24:41.701 --> 01:24:42.801]  What are they going to do about that?
[01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:45.602]  I mean, they're really moving to tax and regulate the shutdown speech.
[01:24:46.022 --> 01:24:52.424]  Rumsfeld and others, the head of the Defense Department, Ministry of Defense in England, has said the same thing, that they're losing.
[01:24:52.464 --> 01:24:54.584]  The mainstream media now knows they've lost credibility.
[01:24:55.065 --> 01:24:59.766]  The alternative media surpassed in visitors and readership and viewership last year.
[01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:03.127]  They're really starting to panic, and I see them moving to try to block us.
[01:25:05.222 --> 01:25:10.064]  Yeah, and I've seen these signs.
[01:25:10.204 --> 01:25:20.287]  I haven't studied it enough to speak with any authority on it, but I certainly fear that that will be the next step and that a few steps have already been taken.
[01:25:20.528 --> 01:25:22.008]  Is Pandora's box already open?
[01:25:22.048 --> 01:25:23.329]  Is the genie already out of the bottle?
[01:25:23.369 --> 01:25:24.509]  Are the floodgates already open?
[01:25:25.549 --> 01:25:26.470]  I just don't know.
[01:25:28.038 --> 01:25:34.719]  The problem is that the alternative media, whereas it's reaching a lot of people, is fractured.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:51.423]  It's fractured and you don't have an organizing center, whereas with the mainstream media, you still have a large percentage of the voting public there, so when they get all hot about something, they can mobilize the masses.
[01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:55.784]  They can still steer the debate to a certain extent, but I see that deteriorating.
[01:25:57.336 --> 01:25:59.538]  Yeah, but it's still so powerful.
[01:26:00.738 --> 01:26:09.324]  My own view as for the future of the 9-11 movement, I think there are two major things that are going on now.
[01:26:09.545 --> 01:26:19.151]  One is the one I already mentioned, the growth of enormous increase in the number of scholars who are involved in it and visibly involved.
[01:26:20.072 --> 01:26:25.556]  The second front that I've been starting to focus more on now is... Young people?
[01:26:26.633 --> 01:26:26.853]  Pardon?
[01:26:27.513 --> 01:26:28.714]  I was just guessing, young people?
[01:26:29.334 --> 01:26:35.296]  Well, that's a third one that needs to come also, is some sort of mass movement.
[01:26:35.997 --> 01:26:42.799]  But maybe prior to that, or simultaneously, it needs to become a religious movement.
[01:26:43.539 --> 01:26:51.442]  So I have been speaking more directly on that recently, speaking specifically from a Christian point of view.
[01:26:52.023 --> 01:26:54.583]  My Madison Lecture, of course, was a more general
[01:26:56.334 --> 01:27:04.097]  question about what religious people in general should do insofar as we share a lot of basic moral values.
[01:27:05.677 --> 01:27:12.099]  We're about to break in a longer segment coming up, but I'd like to give you a chance, David Ray Griffin and Professor Griffin, to elaborate on that.
[01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:21.643]  Before we break, though, I recognized four years ago and have spoken on this, and it's interesting that you've, I'm sure just parallel to that, from your own instinctual level, came up with this.
[01:27:23.723 --> 01:27:30.505]  That 9-11 is a religious-style fable, a religion that is to promote the police state and a centralization of tyranny.
[01:27:31.386 --> 01:27:43.530]  And I looked at it as a generational thing, dealing with government-sponsored terror being the touchstone of a leech, that it is important to get the religious leaders off their duffs into that.
[01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:47.911]  So I'm very excited to be able to start learning that you've got a plan.
[01:27:49.045 --> 01:27:58.551]  Yeah, and I'm starting already to get an increase in emails from people who are saying, uh, I'm, uh, I'm working on contacting churches in this region.
[01:27:58.871 --> 01:28:00.733]  Uh, what are the, what are the resources?
[01:28:01.793 --> 01:28:04.835]  So there's a sudden increase in, in that kind of interest.
[01:28:05.015 --> 01:28:14.021]  Because, uh, schools, colleges, and, and, and, and primary education, and then, uh, the, the churches themselves really are the center of the community.
[01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:15.502]  That's right.
[01:28:15.522 --> 01:28:18.204]  So, uh, just as in Germany,
[01:28:18.857 --> 01:28:25.699]  There was a confessing church movement that said one cannot both be a Christian and a supporter of Nazism.
[01:28:26.679 --> 01:28:33.282]  We need to see a similar thing here with our various religions and American imperialism.
[01:28:33.782 --> 01:28:34.182]  I agree.
[01:28:34.222 --> 01:28:34.782]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:34.822 --> 01:28:39.123]  We'll come back, get into that and a lot more on the other side.
[01:28:39.504 --> 01:28:39.984]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.165 --> 01:28:45.105]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.545 --> 01:28:47.086]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.058 --> 01:28:50.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.301 --> 01:29:01.185]  For months now you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.325 --> 01:29:14.272]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.432 --> 01:29:14.852]  Are you sick
[01:29:15.112 --> 01:29:19.854]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:20.134 --> 01:29:23.915]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:24.155 --> 01:29:29.137]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:30.998]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:31.198 --> 01:29:31.838]  We're good to go.
[01:29:54.002 --> 01:29:57.025]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:57.345 --> 01:30:02.269]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.529 --> 01:30:06.892]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.173 --> 01:30:16.100]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:19.923]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:20.203 --> 01:30:25.251]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:32.241]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.737 --> 01:30:33.378]  What about you?
[01:30:34.038 --> 01:30:38.942]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[01:30:38.982 --> 01:30:39.403]  A $14 savings.
[01:30:39.443 --> 01:30:40.544]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.624 --> 01:30:42.505]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:57.590]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:04.631]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[01:31:05.091 --> 01:31:18.433]  For example, did you know that LIV52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[01:31:18.753 --> 01:31:22.494]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:31:22.674 --> 01:31:23.834]  We're good to go!
[01:32:17.289 --> 01:32:17.910]  Welcome back.
[01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:26.181]  Professor David Wright Griffin is our guest.
[01:32:27.401 --> 01:32:36.732]  And I know that we have Randy in Virginia, Joel in London, England, Fred in Pennsylvania, Doug in Arizona, Chris in Arizona, Sean in New Hampshire, Matthew in North Carolina, and many, many others.
[01:32:36.912 --> 01:32:41.437]  This new phone system can take, I'm told, like 15 plus calls or more.
[01:32:41.457 --> 01:32:43.859]  I guess it'll just continue on and on and on.
[01:32:44.821 --> 01:32:46.102]  So we'll try to get to all your calls.
[01:32:46.182 --> 01:32:47.724]  Professor Griffin is a gentleman.
[01:32:47.744 --> 01:32:48.625]  He's very gracious.
[01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:56.479]  He just got back from several speeches and he's going to be with us until the middle of the next hour, so we have plenty of time to take your calls.
[01:32:56.539 --> 01:32:58.361]  We'll go to calls later in this segment.
[01:32:58.822 --> 01:32:59.943]  I appreciate you all being patient.
[01:32:59.963 --> 01:33:02.527]  We'll try to go to Joel first because he's on his dime from London, England.
[01:33:03.746 --> 01:33:12.576]  But, Professor Griffin, I don't do this, and I want to get into your religious views on this and how to make a movement in the religious circles where it needs to be.
[01:33:12.616 --> 01:33:19.244]  That's the black brigades of the priests and pastors that started the Revolutionary War.
[01:33:19.264 --> 01:33:22.228]  They were the heart, the dynamo, the fulcrum, the engine.
[01:33:22.728 --> 01:33:23.788]  Same thing against Hitler.
[01:33:24.048 --> 01:33:33.890]  In Heinz Hobel's Order of the Deathshead, a 900-page book I read in high school, it was all the secret Nazi communiques about how their biggest problems in occupied Europe were the Christians.
[01:33:34.171 --> 01:33:36.071]  Just like slavery was ended by Christians.
[01:33:36.671 --> 01:33:37.691]  And so much more.
[01:33:37.771 --> 01:33:40.432]  It is our jobs to get out there and do this.
[01:33:40.472 --> 01:33:41.632]  It's our historical role.
[01:33:41.652 --> 01:33:47.793]  I want to speak to that, but I want you to understand, Professor, I do not do this because of ego.
[01:33:48.614 --> 01:33:49.834]  The question I'm going to ask you
[01:33:50.882 --> 01:34:03.991]  I do this because I have been forced to because of people claiming the mantle of founder, claiming the mantle of leaders, claiming the mantle of forerunners, and then even saying you're a Johnny-come-lately and others.
[01:34:04.432 --> 01:34:14.519]  I'm a platform for you and Dr. Bob Bowman and Andres von Bulow and Michael Meacher and David Shaler MI5 agents and Andy Michon MI5 and Dr. Ray McGovern.
[01:34:17.481 --> 01:34:22.545]  I'm a platform for all of you who put everything on the line for Charlie Sheen and many others that are going to go public.
[01:34:23.265 --> 01:34:25.226]  We are here to defend and survive.
[01:34:25.366 --> 01:34:26.447]  I'm in this for the right reason.
[01:34:26.487 --> 01:34:27.468]  You're in this for the right reason.
[01:34:27.488 --> 01:34:34.973]  When I went on air on 9-11 and said it's an inside job, laid out the facts, when I did it two months before the attack, I lost a lot.
[01:34:35.013 --> 01:34:35.894]  I went through a lot.
[01:34:36.354 --> 01:34:43.179]  And I did it because I understood what was happening because I was already an expert on government-sponsored terror and had made films about it previous to 9-11.
[01:34:44.873 --> 01:34:49.177]  And then I saw other people claiming that they were the leaders, the founders, when it wasn't true.
[01:34:49.217 --> 01:34:51.919]  They were poo-pooing involvement for six months, a year.
[01:34:52.299 --> 01:35:00.786]  And then now they claim they're the founders and tell us that we've got to get in line, that we've got to subscribe to their orthodoxy, and I see it as very, very dangerous.
[01:35:00.806 --> 01:35:02.928]  So I'd like to hear from you, who's researched this,
[01:35:03.588 --> 01:35:05.650]  Who do you think first talked about and exposed 9-11?
[01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:08.231]  I'd like to hear from you if it matters.
[01:35:08.371 --> 01:35:08.532]  Who?
[01:35:08.552 --> 01:35:11.293]  Because I don't think it matters that I'm the founder of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:35:11.594 --> 01:35:17.998]  It's irritating to me, though, to be the founder of this, to have taken the hits that I'm not going to get into here on air.
[01:35:18.038 --> 01:35:18.919]  They were substantial.
[01:35:19.819 --> 01:35:29.666]  And then to see others try to position themselves and basically rewrite history, knowing that the foundational view of any movement is a very important position to hold.
[01:35:32.065 --> 01:35:36.066]  Well, this is a question that I haven't dealt with.
[01:35:36.246 --> 01:35:40.027]  I did mention it in the New Pearl Harbor in a note.
[01:35:40.087 --> 01:35:50.269]  I said one problem with the book is that when I cite certain sources, they're not necessarily the original sources for these stories.
[01:35:50.849 --> 01:35:59.431]  For example, I appealed heavily to Paul Thompson's work and Nafis Ahmed's work
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.321]  But, you know, they were not founders.
[01:36:02.381 --> 01:36:03.342]  They were derivatives.
[01:36:03.382 --> 01:36:06.644]  And Paul himself admits that.
[01:36:06.784 --> 01:36:08.725]  He got started by Michael Rupert.
[01:36:08.765 --> 01:36:10.766]  I know other people got started from you.
[01:36:10.786 --> 01:36:14.568]  It's not a question I deal with.
[01:36:15.049 --> 01:36:17.050]  I've called myself a Johnny-come-lately.
[01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:19.531]  What we need are a lot more.
[01:36:19.551 --> 01:36:25.735]  I mean, the way to express our gratitude to people like you and Rupert and
[01:36:26.850 --> 01:36:54.573]  uh... others who were there at the forefront is to get a lot more johnny's and uh... valley come lately closer understand i don't have a movement i agree with you professor i don't believe it even matters but other people then try to position themselves as grandpa bars i'm talking about orthodoxy so you agree that that doesn't matter i mean i think it's despicable i mean what else now the important thing is what are people doing now and uh... my view is that uh...
[01:36:55.231 --> 01:37:00.375]  A history of the movement will need to be written, particularly if the movement is successful.
[01:37:00.975 --> 01:37:07.320]  And at that stage, the historians can sort out who did what, and who got to what first, and so on.
[01:37:07.961 --> 01:37:15.586]  But at this stage, I think that's a great distraction, I agree with you, and that we ought to just focus on the issues.
[01:37:15.626 --> 01:37:20.690]  Let me make clear that I've only addressed this two or three times in the last couple of years on air, only because I've been forced to, sir.
[01:37:21.988 --> 01:37:23.349]  It's like pulling teeth for me.
[01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:28.471]  Frankly, I don't like being on the radar screen as, you know, as the Moses of this movement.
[01:37:29.771 --> 01:37:30.932]  I mean, I like other people.
[01:37:30.972 --> 01:37:32.433]  I like lots of other people doing it.
[01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:36.694]  And I just think it's disgusting what some other individuals have done.
[01:37:38.075 --> 01:37:46.999]  Yeah, it's unfortunate, but I think for the most part we just need to ignore that and keep focusing on the issues and the real enemy.
[01:37:47.019 --> 01:37:49.239]  Yeah, this is not about egos.
[01:37:49.259 --> 01:37:50.220]  This is about survival.
[01:37:50.822 --> 01:37:51.082]  Right.
[01:37:51.222 --> 01:37:52.462]  I mean, I wake up at 3 a.m.
[01:37:52.502 --> 01:37:57.023]  some mornings covered in sweat realizing we have a terrorist government, realizing we're all in danger.
[01:37:57.283 --> 01:37:57.964]  I'm freaked out.
[01:37:58.324 --> 01:37:59.764]  I mean, I take this real serious.
[01:38:00.164 --> 01:38:07.185]  And I can't believe there's all these prima donna ego maniacs out there running around attacking everyone, saying, you know, my way or the highway.
[01:38:08.846 --> 01:38:13.447]  Yeah, and these questions come up when I'm talking.
[01:38:13.507 --> 01:38:19.148]  What do you think about, you know, who are disinformation agents and who are
[01:38:19.924 --> 01:38:21.984]  Left gatekeepers and all that.
[01:38:22.004 --> 01:38:23.205]  Figure it out for yourself!
[01:38:23.585 --> 01:38:29.646]  I just ignore those and, you know, keep trying to focus on the issues.
[01:38:30.026 --> 01:38:32.906]  I totally agree, sir, and that's why I've been affected, that's why you've been affected.
[01:38:33.967 --> 01:38:43.028]  Give us your view on the theology, how to get in there to the churches, how to use them as their proper designation, as an engine to defend human life and liberty.
[01:38:44.468 --> 01:38:46.769]  Well, I think it's very important to see that
[01:38:48.072 --> 01:39:08.716]  This 9-11 based imperial stage that we're in now is definitely a religious movement and one that is diametrically opposed to the basic values of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism... Explain how it's religious, because I agree, I concur, but explain.
[01:39:09.616 --> 01:39:17.758]  Well, it's religious in that religion has to do with having the censure in harmony
[01:39:18.604 --> 01:39:20.426]  With the way things really are.
[01:39:20.606 --> 01:39:26.291]  I think that's the most generic idea, definition of religion.
[01:39:26.371 --> 01:39:29.513]  It's the desire to be in harmony with the way things really are.
[01:39:30.474 --> 01:39:40.863]  Now, the way things really are, that can be understood as God, or that can be understood as the movement of history, like from a more Hegelian point of view.
[01:39:41.704 --> 01:39:45.107]  And so people who say, well, you're just on the wrong side of history,
[01:39:46.219 --> 01:39:51.482]  They're making it a religious appeal there, and that's what goes on here.
[01:39:51.602 --> 01:39:55.363]  Sometimes they use explicitly the God language.
[01:39:55.483 --> 01:40:07.869]  Bush, immediately after 9-11, gave this sermon in the cathedral, in which he consecrated this as a religious movement that God was blessing.
[01:40:08.246 --> 01:40:22.194]  And believing the fraud of 9-11 as the foundational event to build this empire out of, which they even admitted in documents previous to the attack they launched, they say they're going to use it as a foundational event, it's almost like a sacrament to just mindlessly not ask questions.
[01:40:22.675 --> 01:40:26.377]  That's right, that it's sacrilegious to ask questions.
[01:40:27.157 --> 01:40:32.501]  And another feature of religion, unfortunately, most of the time,
[01:40:34.176 --> 01:40:38.179]  is that things are supposed to be taken on faith without proof.
[01:40:38.399 --> 01:40:47.145]  Now, that's not a characteristic of all religion, as some people mistakenly think, but it is a widespread tendency, and that's what we have here.
[01:40:47.906 --> 01:40:59.814]  And I saw an interview the other day by Ed Haas in the Muckraker Report, where he had interviewed Michael Newman, a spokesperson for NIST.
[01:41:01.618 --> 01:41:03.759]  The National Institute of Standards and Technology.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:15.107]  And Haas was saying, well, you know, we've got all these scientists now who are rejecting the NIST report and there's this great division in the country between people who believe the official theory and
[01:41:15.966 --> 01:41:20.490]  Why don't we just have a public debate between these scientists and get this cleared up?
[01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:21.231]  They can't do it.
[01:41:21.571 --> 01:41:29.597]  And he said that no scientist from NIST would engage in any public debate with any scientist who reject the NIST report.
[01:41:29.857 --> 01:41:31.078]  You just hit the key point there.
[01:41:31.119 --> 01:41:34.521]  Charlie Sheen said, stop talking about what I did 15 years ago, 20 years ago.
[01:41:34.942 --> 01:41:36.163]  Talk about my facts.
[01:41:36.303 --> 01:41:38.324]  Challenge me on the facts.
[01:41:38.364 --> 01:41:41.707]  I think that should be a slogan for the movement, is challenge us on the facts.
[01:41:41.747 --> 01:41:42.728]  Debate us on the facts.
[01:41:42.988 --> 01:41:44.529]  Don't use little buzzword
[01:41:46.193 --> 01:41:50.947]  religious dogma that's right and showbiz tonight reported that
[01:41:51.618 --> 01:41:57.963]  They tried to get somebody from the government to come on and take on some representatives.
[01:41:58.344 --> 01:42:01.426]  We learned it was Chairman Keene and then he canceled an hour and a half before.
[01:42:01.506 --> 01:42:09.393]  I'm talking about the earlier night when Mike Berger from Truth.org was on.
[01:42:09.673 --> 01:42:16.559]  They brought on this woman from National Geographic who was completely incapable of speaking.
[01:42:17.341 --> 01:42:34.216]  There's authority about it, and evidently they tried to get some spokesperson from the government, and no one would come on, and then as you say, the representative from the Kane Commission backed out at the last minute, so they had to cancel the show with Ed Asner and Sandra Pick.
[01:42:34.977 --> 01:42:41.683]  So this is a sure sign, and that's what I raised in this talk, a sure sign that the official story is a myth.
[01:42:42.392 --> 01:42:43.293]  In the pejorative sense.
[01:42:43.313 --> 01:42:47.415]  Oh, they admitted to me that no one would come on to debate me, and I said, all the better.
[01:42:47.455 --> 01:42:48.775]  I can go on and just crush them.
[01:42:48.815 --> 01:42:52.417]  I mean, have you ever seen so much info spewed out in two six-minute segments?
[01:42:52.998 --> 01:42:53.618]  Have you seen them?
[01:42:55.159 --> 01:43:04.724]  And this is what should make people really suspicious, that nobody from the Kaine Commission, the government, or NIST will come on and defend their official reports.
[01:43:04.884 --> 01:43:11.948]  Well, they put that little ringer in up against Berg and others, but they wouldn't get in the ring with me or Ed Asner.
[01:43:13.228 --> 01:43:25.980]  No, and this shows you if with their best scientists on their payroll, they're afraid to take on radio talk shows and actors, they're in very bad shape.
[01:43:27.233 --> 01:43:28.374]  Well, I agree with you, sir.
[01:43:28.394 --> 01:43:31.356]  I mean, it's really good news.
[01:43:31.416 --> 01:43:34.218]  And the last day when they were going to have Asner on, they were going to go the whole week.
[01:43:34.238 --> 01:43:36.020]  They were saying, we're getting the highest ratings we've ever had.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:43.125]  We're getting thousands of emails an hour, 53,400 plus votes, 83% believing, Sheen, that there's a cover-up of the official story.
[01:43:43.825 --> 01:43:48.909]  And they just said, yeah, we can't get anybody to debate you, and now we're not allowed to have anybody on unless somebody's debating.
[01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:51.311]  And then they're even saying, just kill the story, period.
[01:43:52.011 --> 01:43:53.733]  And it isn't even about ratings anymore.
[01:43:54.503 --> 01:44:01.967]  I think maybe this would be a good strategy for the 9-11 Truth Movement to start taunting the government.
[01:44:03.147 --> 01:44:05.329]  Say, come on, defend your account.
[01:44:05.389 --> 01:44:09.971]  Defend your account in public against people who are qualified to challenge it.
[01:44:11.172 --> 01:44:17.495]  And keep raising that challenge until maybe the mainstream media would say, isn't this peculiar?
[01:44:18.354 --> 01:44:23.281]  Yeah, it's like a prize fighter that can't get in any fights because no one will go up against him.
[01:44:23.642 --> 01:44:26.065]  Sometimes they've got to get on TV and taunt the opponent.
[01:44:27.788 --> 01:44:34.137]  That's right, so maybe your show can be a forum for that taunting to go on.
[01:44:34.631 --> 01:44:36.272]  Well, I've been taunting him for a long time.
[01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:38.373]  I mean, I went on C-SPAN and taunted him.
[01:44:38.473 --> 01:44:41.175]  I've done thousands of radio interviews and taunted him.
[01:44:41.855 --> 01:44:48.999]  And you and I were involved in a national debate on Coast to Coast AM with Lance and others, and I mean, it's just that they had no facts.
[01:44:49.039 --> 01:44:50.220]  It was nothing but name-calling.
[01:44:52.101 --> 01:45:04.268]  Yeah, but I mean, you know, actual representatives of the government, if they have any confidence in their story, they should have a spokesperson they can send out to debate people whom they consider
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:08.082]  Uh, you know, nutty conspiracy theorists.
[01:45:08.162 --> 01:45:13.186]  If they think that we're all so nutty, they could surely show us up in a public debate.
[01:45:14.006 --> 01:45:15.167]  Well, I hardly agree with you.
[01:45:15.187 --> 01:45:15.247]  Now...
[01:45:16.647 --> 01:45:26.272]  Another example of this is the fact that the Commission itself wouldn't even face the facts, not even mentioning the support pillars, not even mentioning Building 7.
[01:45:26.892 --> 01:45:37.438]  We confronted Chairman Keene, we played the clips yesterday, but we confronted him Friday when he was here north of Austin in Georgetown at Southwestern University, and we said, why didn't you talk about Building 7?
[01:45:37.778 --> 01:45:39.119]  He said, oh, we didn't really look at that.
[01:45:39.139 --> 01:45:40.920]  That was just his answer.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.862]  Right, because the FEMA report had already come out saying
[01:45:45.819 --> 01:45:53.563]  The best scenario they could come up with to explain the collapse of Building 7 had only a low probability of occurrence.
[01:45:54.463 --> 01:45:58.605]  So that's, I think, why the 9-11 Commission did not look at Building 7.
[01:45:58.666 --> 01:46:05.149]  Well, I think Charlie Sheen was also kind of a crap for him, and we didn't do this on purpose, but I think it organically developed.
[01:46:05.788 --> 01:46:08.249]  Let me just say something about Mr. Sheen, and I'm not kissing up to him.
[01:46:08.269 --> 01:46:11.189]  I know a lot of other big Hollywood people, and they're not as informed.
[01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:13.890]  They're very informed, but not as informed as Sheen.
[01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:17.911]  This guy spends hours a day researching this, and he is so informed.
[01:46:20.391 --> 01:46:26.552]  I think they thought in some quarters, the neocon publications, that they could attack him, but then everybody just asked the question.
[01:46:26.592 --> 01:46:29.393]  I mean, they'll have blogs on, say, Scripps Hour News Service,
[01:46:30.501 --> 01:46:42.544]  With 500 people and there might be six people out of 500 that disagree with Sheen on the blog of a writer who was attacking Sheen, who then can't address any of his facts, just name calls.
[01:46:42.864 --> 01:46:50.647]  So I think it was kind of a trap for the neocons because they went and attacked Sheen and they even admit, London Guardian writers and others admit, that it totally blew up in their face.
[01:46:51.647 --> 01:46:54.908]  Yeah, and I think these percentages that
[01:46:56.868 --> 01:47:06.337]  On CNN, when they ask their viewership, do you agree with Charlie Sheen that the government's covering up the truth, what was it, 82, 83 percent?
[01:47:06.898 --> 01:47:10.762]  It hit 86, they pulled it and then claimed it was 83.
[01:47:11.622 --> 01:47:11.963]  Yeah.
[01:47:12.423 --> 01:47:21.592]  Well, I think it's time for somebody with some deep pockets to sponsor a Zogby poll nationwide asking the question,
[01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:27.213]  Do you think our own government orchestrated 9-11?
[01:47:28.053 --> 01:47:38.138]  And it would be very interesting to find out what the current state is of that opinion, even though the mainstream media has yet to begin to address it.
[01:47:38.939 --> 01:47:41.300]  I think the percentage would be pretty high already.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.862]  Well, Jimmy Walter says he did a whole other Zodwey I didn't know of.
[01:47:44.902 --> 01:47:47.163]  He's commissioned too, and he said it got similar numbers.
[01:47:48.539 --> 01:47:49.960]  I haven't heard about the second one.
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:51.660]  He did another one a few months ago, yeah.
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.461]  Well, let's take a few calls, sir.
[01:47:54.581 --> 01:47:58.903]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[01:47:59.603 --> 01:48:03.565]  Let's go ahead and speak with Joel from London, England.
[01:48:03.925 --> 01:48:05.446]  Joel on line 9.
[01:48:06.266 --> 01:48:07.166]  You're on the air.
[01:48:07.246 --> 01:48:08.827]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:48:10.064 --> 01:48:12.026]  Thank you very much for taking my call, Alex.
[01:48:12.046 --> 01:48:14.509]  It's an absolute pleasure to speak to you and Dr Griffin.
[01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:17.972]  I've got two or three very quick points.
[01:48:17.992 --> 01:48:20.434]  My first one is to David O. Griffin.
[01:48:21.235 --> 01:48:24.198]  How do you think it's being covered up as it is?
[01:48:24.278 --> 01:48:31.124]  Do you think the establishment are threatening, really threatening a kind of 9-12 if people go public on it?
[01:48:31.144 --> 01:48:31.945]  Do you think it's that?
[01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:37.265]  Well, I don't know, and I don't get very much into the future because it's so indeterminate, so I don't think I have anything to add to that.
[01:49:01.627 --> 01:49:04.830]  Do you think we're in danger of this crowd carrying out more attacks, period?
[01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:06.351]  Oh, sure.
[01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:09.913]  I think that's a definite danger.
[01:49:10.254 --> 01:49:14.997]  But, you know, whether they will do it or not, I don't have any predictions about that.
[01:49:15.017 --> 01:49:18.019]  Don't you think it'll blow up in their face, literally and figuratively, if they try it?
[01:49:19.361 --> 01:49:20.121]  I don't know.
[01:49:21.162 --> 01:49:27.607]  You know, the people get so panicked when something like this happens that reason usually does not prevail.
[01:49:28.226 --> 01:49:30.187]  For a while, though, but it's like a heroin addict.
[01:49:30.227 --> 01:49:33.488]  The dose gets bigger and bigger, but the effect gets diminished.
[01:49:35.129 --> 01:49:39.731]  Yeah, but the effect lasts long enough to get the next operation going.
[01:49:40.511 --> 01:49:40.931]  You're right.
[01:49:41.071 --> 01:49:41.731]  You're absolutely right.
[01:49:41.771 --> 01:49:43.312]  Joel, you want to add something else?
[01:49:45.433 --> 01:49:49.895]  I just was going to ask... Stay there.
[01:49:50.075 --> 01:49:50.355]  Stay there.
[01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:51.415]  I'll let you finish up from England.
[01:49:54.818 --> 01:49:57.679]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.939 --> 01:49:59.520]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:04.523]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.863 --> 01:50:09.305]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.725 --> 01:50:13.887]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.127 --> 01:50:16.970]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:21.714]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.914 --> 01:50:26.359]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:50:58.048 --> 01:51:06.857]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:07.177 --> 01:51:11.862]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.322 --> 01:51:19.069]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.449 --> 01:51:31.200]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:53:00.198 --> 01:53:02.479]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:04.275 --> 01:53:06.357]  David Ray Griffin is our guest in the next hour.
[01:53:06.397 --> 01:53:10.340]  We'll tell you about his two best-selling books which we're trying to get a hold of to carry here.
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:12.701]  You can get them for his publisher.
[01:53:12.741 --> 01:53:13.622]  They're excellent, both of them.
[01:53:15.423 --> 01:53:22.589]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to our caller, Joel in London, England.
[01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:23.830]  Joel, finish up what you were saying.
[01:53:24.370 --> 01:53:33.597]  Yeah, I was just saying that, Alex, because I've noticed in the news you've got Hamilton, Keene and the Council on Foreign Relations have really been heavily talking up the threat of a new
[01:53:34.341 --> 01:53:34.941]  Terrorist event.
[01:53:34.961 --> 01:53:35.841]  That's very concerning.
[01:53:35.881 --> 01:53:41.403]  Yeah, we got him on tape last Friday saying we're going to get nude, give up all your rights, the internet's bad, biometrics will save you.
[01:53:42.543 --> 01:53:46.484]  It's just extraordinary, really, because you can't help but interpret some of that.
[01:53:46.524 --> 01:53:50.165]  Is that part of that response to the things with Charlie Sheen and yourself?
[01:53:50.985 --> 01:53:54.506]  It's part of their fear-mongering as a bunch of criminal control freaks.
[01:53:54.526 --> 01:53:55.526]  David Ray Griffin, comments?
[01:53:58.347 --> 01:53:59.087]  Nothing to add.
[01:53:59.187 --> 01:54:00.167]  I agree with you.
[01:54:01.408 --> 01:54:02.288]  Anything else, Joe?
[01:54:03.115 --> 01:54:08.540]  Yeah, one last point is on who I've heard from David Ray Griffith in some of his speeches.
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:15.366]  He often talks about Philip Delacalle, who's the secret, sort of, not secret, but the executive director of the 9-11 Commission.
[01:54:15.386 --> 01:54:16.007]  That's right, isn't it?
[01:54:16.593 --> 01:54:20.475]  I mean, there's some extraordinarily disturbing information on this guy.
[01:54:20.495 --> 01:54:21.915]  If you go to Wikipedia, I don't think you'll read it.
[01:54:21.935 --> 01:54:22.555]  I'm not going to read all of it.
[01:54:22.575 --> 01:54:26.057]  Well, the whole commission... And it's legalized in public midst and stuff like that.
[01:54:26.077 --> 01:54:26.877]  It's extraordinary.
[01:54:26.957 --> 01:54:28.158]  I mean, it's mind-blowing.
[01:54:28.458 --> 01:54:30.059]  Well, yeah.
[01:54:30.659 --> 01:54:32.720]  I mean, that whole commission had conflicts of interest.
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:34.740]  Keynes and business with the Bin Laden family.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.961]  Thanks for the call.
[01:54:36.301 --> 01:54:38.722]  Comments on the conflicts of interest with the Keynes Commission, David?
[01:54:38.802 --> 01:54:39.382]  Well, yes.
[01:54:39.442 --> 01:54:44.384]  Let me add, I've learned a new thing about Philip Zelikow that's just amazing.
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:55:02.546]  You know, one of the apparent motives for 9-11 was to get the new doctrine of preemptive warfare, preemptive preventive warfare, accepted, where we could attack other countries even though there was no imminent threat.
[01:55:04.667 --> 01:55:09.909]  This doctrine was first enunciated in the National Security Strategy of 2002.
[01:55:14.089 --> 01:55:17.692]  There hasn't been much public discussion about who was the author of that.
[01:55:17.932 --> 01:55:18.433]  Zelikow.
[01:55:18.953 --> 01:55:35.326]  James Mann in Rise of the Vulcans reports that first Richard Haas had written a first draft representing the State Department and Condoleezza Rice looked at it and thought it wasn't bold enough and so she brought in Zelikow to write this.
[01:55:36.055 --> 01:55:54.516]  So here you have that prior to becoming Executive Director of the 9-11 Commission, which was supposed to be investigating why the White House allowed these attacks to occur, he's the one who has written their primary ideological doctrine
[01:55:55.471 --> 01:56:01.614]  Justifying this greatly increased, increasingly bellicose foreign policy.
[01:56:01.694 --> 01:56:03.355]  He's a neocon priest.
[01:56:03.515 --> 01:56:04.815]  That's right.
[01:56:05.576 --> 01:56:07.276]  Pushing wars of aggression.
[01:56:07.316 --> 01:56:09.377]  Hitlerian invasion plans.
[01:56:09.797 --> 01:56:10.338]  That's right.
[01:56:10.478 --> 01:56:13.819]  Max Boot had called NSS2002 a quintessentially neocon document.
[01:56:21.198 --> 01:56:48.564]  So, this is the guy that's supposedly investigating the Bush administration, someone who holds the most bellicose views, and they evidently, according to James Mann and others who've written about this, none of the others, like Cheney and Rumsfeld, even had to get involved, even though it sounds like their language, that they were perfectly content to let
[01:56:49.597 --> 01:56:52.519]  Rice and Zelikow handle the writing.
[01:56:52.559 --> 01:57:02.124]  Well, exactly, but back to the commission, we asked Chairman Keene Friday in the press conference, we said, this is an independent, Bush appointed you.
[01:57:02.624 --> 01:57:05.185]  But he said, ah, yes, but I appointed the others.
[01:57:05.265 --> 01:57:06.246]  Well, what does that mean?
[01:57:07.406 --> 01:57:10.808]  It's like Hitler appoints Heinrich Himmler and then he appoints the SS deputies.
[01:57:12.749 --> 01:57:14.370]  That's the new meaning of independence.
[01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:17.712]  Yeah, and then first they tried to have Dr. Kissinger
[01:57:19.351 --> 01:57:21.472]  Alright, we've got a few more segments left with our guest.
[01:57:21.492 --> 01:57:27.056]  We'll come back, take more of your calls and any other issues that David Ray Griffin wishes to cover.
[01:57:28.057 --> 01:57:30.178]  We'll tell you about his publisher and how to get his books as well.
[01:57:30.538 --> 01:57:32.320]  Stay with us.

[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:50.581]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.241 --> 01:57:52.321]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.021 --> 01:57:54.142]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.782 --> 01:57:55.602]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.343 --> 01:57:58.263]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.283 --> 01:58:01.845]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.105 --> 01:58:06.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.887 --> 01:58:11.268]  We're joined by Professor David Ray Griffin.
[01:58:12.688 --> 01:58:13.869]  And we're gonna go to your calls.
[01:58:15.049 --> 01:58:17.470]  All 11 of them if we have time before he leaves us.
[01:58:18.723 --> 01:58:25.708]  But Professor Grimm, before we go any further, tell us about your two books, tell us about websites, tell us about places to check out your work.
[01:58:26.609 --> 01:58:43.322]  Okay, the easiest way for my two books, the new Pearl Harbor and the 9-11 Commission report, Omissions and Distortions, is Amazon.com, but also all good bookstores locally have it.
[01:58:43.991 --> 01:58:47.972]  Let me also mention that I've got some new books coming out pretty soon.
[01:58:48.052 --> 01:58:56.915]  There's one on Christian faith and the truth behind 9-11, which Westminster John Knox will be publishing in May.
[01:58:57.495 --> 01:59:10.540]  They will also be doing a book that Richard Falk and John Cobb and Katherine Keller and I are doing on American Empire and the Commonwealth of God, in which there's some about 9-11.
[01:59:12.048 --> 01:59:14.890]  Then there are two books that Interlink is putting out.
[01:59:15.450 --> 01:59:19.213]  Peter Dale Scott and I are editing a book called 9-11 and the American Empire.
[01:59:19.873 --> 01:59:21.354]  Intellectuals speak out.
[01:59:22.175 --> 01:59:31.001]  And Kevin Barrett and John Cobb and Sandra Lubarski, a Jew, a Christian and a Muslim, are editing a book called 9-11 and the American Empire.
[01:59:31.521 --> 01:59:33.663]  Christian, Jews and Muslims speak out.
[01:59:33.683 --> 01:59:37.526]  So I mention this to reinforce what I said earlier, that both
[01:59:39.582 --> 01:59:49.346]  The number of scholars getting involved in this is increasing but also there is going to be a surge of religious writing about 9-11.
[01:59:49.686 --> 01:59:57.750]  Now I know we can't reveal a lot on air but there's a lot of other big prominent people that are very close to going public in Hollywood and in government that I know of.
[01:59:58.271 --> 02:00:02.273]  You know of a few others and even some other individuals that are very well known.
[02:00:03.973 --> 02:00:07.075]  Do you predict or do you have an inkling that any of them will start going public?
[02:00:09.284 --> 02:00:26.649]  At this stage I don't know, but it certainly helps because, rightly or wrongly, that's about the only way this movement gets any mainstream attention is if some people in the entertainment business speak out.
[02:00:27.742 --> 02:00:31.943]  Because then if the media ignores them, it makes a story of its own, of how are you ignoring this?
[02:00:32.263 --> 02:00:41.704]  You'll have top news if one of these people falls off their bicycle, or, you know, drinks a beer, but, uh, you know, huge news like this, they try to ignore it.
[02:00:41.884 --> 02:00:46.365]  You know, the media tried to ignore the Sheen thing for a few days, but it just got too big on the web.
[02:00:47.425 --> 02:00:56.387]  Yeah, so you can have a physicist come out and say, uh, the World Trade Center collapses could not have occurred without, uh,
[02:00:57.114 --> 02:00:57.814]  Explosive.
[02:00:58.635 --> 02:01:04.037]  And for the most part, that's ignored, as if a physicist's word is not very important.
[02:01:04.697 --> 02:01:09.319]  But when Charlie Sheen comes out, it gets a lot of attention.
[02:01:10.519 --> 02:01:22.624]  Now, that's, you know, I mean, I think that's great that Charlie could do this, and it'll be great if other people can do it, because unfortunately, the way our culture is now,
[02:01:23.194 --> 02:01:25.055]  That is about the only way to break through.
[02:01:25.435 --> 02:01:26.136]  Well, he knew that.
[02:01:26.156 --> 02:01:27.437]  I mean, he did this... Oh, yeah.
[02:01:27.457 --> 02:01:35.622]  I mean, he did this selflessly, and then it made me angry to see some of the so-called minority of the 9-11 people criticize him when he did them a huge favor.
[02:01:36.002 --> 02:01:46.749]  Yeah, and it was very good that it was somebody who, as you said, had done his homework so that he was making points that other people could then defend.
[02:01:47.369 --> 02:01:49.730]  Well, Charlie, I know, listens to the rebroadcast of this show.
[02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:50.511]  You want to say hi to him?
[02:01:51.505 --> 02:01:52.105]  Hey, Charlie.
[02:01:52.806 --> 02:01:53.326]  Good work.
[02:01:53.926 --> 02:01:54.386]  Keep it up.
[02:01:55.627 --> 02:01:56.707]  He's such a great guy.
[02:01:57.287 --> 02:01:59.048]  Just really informed.
[02:01:59.068 --> 02:02:01.089]  You ought to hear him even when he was great on air.
[02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.989]  You ought to hear him off air.
[02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.549]  Oh, boy.
[02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:05.131]  He really has done his homework.
[02:02:05.971 --> 02:02:08.912]  We're going to break here in a moment and come back and just take a raft of calls.
[02:02:10.073 --> 02:02:17.295]  But just to give people kind of a taste, what are a few of the other little tidbits or issues, things you want to talk about when we get back?
[02:02:17.936 --> 02:02:18.276]  Okay.
[02:02:19.016 --> 02:02:21.017]  Can you just give us an idea of some of the things you might want to mention?
[02:02:22.527 --> 02:02:29.272]  Oh, um, well, I could talk a little more about this, uh, about the, uh, the religious side of this.
[02:02:30.112 --> 02:02:32.814]  Good, let's do that with Professor David Ray Griffin.
[02:02:32.854 --> 02:02:33.935]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[02:04:57.694 --> 02:05:05.579]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.739 --> 02:05:12.784]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:13.004 --> 02:05:14.224]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:14.364 --> 02:05:17.766]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:17.806 --> 02:05:18.926]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:19.206 --> 02:05:20.507]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:20.707 --> 02:05:27.529]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:05:34.351 --> 02:05:38.352]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:38.372 --> 02:05:40.313]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:56.943 --> 02:05:59.443]  Alright, you've been holding patiently.
[02:06:00.624 --> 02:06:08.185]  And we've got, what, 12 calls online of folks that would like to talk to David Ray Griffin.
[02:06:09.365 --> 02:06:12.446]  And right now, we're going to go ahead and go back to your calls.
[02:06:13.166 --> 02:06:15.346]  The number to join us is 888-234-4564.
[02:06:15.586 --> 02:06:24.928]  We're having to use the backup phone system here because the phone company is back for like the fifth time trying to get it all hooked up to the network.
[02:06:25.515 --> 02:06:26.536]  But we're doing it down here.
[02:06:26.876 --> 02:06:30.158]  Let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Virginia.
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:33.040]  Randy, welcome.
[02:06:33.260 --> 02:06:34.401]  You are on the air, sir.
[02:06:35.742 --> 02:06:36.222]  Hello, Alex.
[02:06:36.262 --> 02:06:36.863]  How are you doing today?
[02:06:37.063 --> 02:06:37.423]  Good, sir.
[02:06:37.443 --> 02:06:37.804]  Go ahead.
[02:06:39.164 --> 02:06:41.586]  I called you a few months ago.
[02:06:42.187 --> 02:06:48.251]  I was going to make you a copy of a DVD that's in my local library where the military came here and took over the town back in the fifties.
[02:06:49.211 --> 02:06:49.672]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:49.732 --> 02:06:51.413]  I've made you the copy and I've
[02:06:52.031 --> 02:06:54.792]  I know you keep saying your address, but I can't get it quick enough.
[02:06:54.812 --> 02:06:56.292]  3001 South Lamar?
[02:06:56.472 --> 02:06:57.152]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:57.172 --> 02:07:03.614]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:07:04.394 --> 02:07:06.414]  And I'm aware of that historical event.
[02:07:06.814 --> 02:07:08.895]  They admitted it was for a martial law takeover drill.
[02:07:10.535 --> 02:07:12.016]  Yeah, so I will get that out to you.
[02:07:12.056 --> 02:07:17.477]  Now, I do have a question that is really synchronized exactly with what you've been talking about today.
[02:07:19.682 --> 02:07:25.947]  I'm a Christian, you're a Christian, we know that the New World Order is totally satanic, which you've covered in your films and stuff.
[02:07:28.689 --> 02:07:40.258]  This is something that people don't know, you know, how the New World Order, we know they've captured the mainstream media, for instance, but the average person has no idea about their involvement in the mainstream church.
[02:07:40.458 --> 02:07:42.039]  And I don't know if we've covered that.
[02:07:42.816 --> 02:07:44.417]  You know, enough to really get that out there.
[02:07:44.457 --> 02:07:51.902]  Well, governments, I mean, look at China, look at Russia, they always try to take over and use the churches as their organs, and the neocons have been doing that quite effectively.
[02:07:51.922 --> 02:07:53.283]  Do you have a question or comment for our guest?
[02:07:55.124 --> 02:08:04.110]  Uh, well, just, you know, maybe he can comment on a few of the, of the way the New World Order is going to have to use, you know, the religious, uh, organized people.
[02:08:04.150 --> 02:08:05.271]  Like, look at Pat Robertson.
[02:08:05.311 --> 02:08:07.092]  He's coming out saying we need to kill Chavez.
[02:08:09.757 --> 02:08:10.457]  Great point, sir.
[02:08:10.698 --> 02:08:12.199]  And you can call me back one day when I don't have a guest.
[02:08:12.219 --> 02:08:12.880]  We'll spend more time.
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:13.581]  You're a great caller.
[02:08:13.601 --> 02:08:14.281]  Sorry to have to cut you off.
[02:08:14.301 --> 02:08:15.162]  I'm going to have to move quicker.
[02:08:15.943 --> 02:08:19.587]  Yes, with the Faith-Based Initiative and all this, they're trying to pay off the churches.
[02:08:19.607 --> 02:08:25.192]  You're saying we need the churches to go back, to default back to their original role of fighting tyranny.
[02:08:25.773 --> 02:08:28.476]  David Ray Griffin, who's a professor of theology.
[02:08:28.516 --> 02:08:28.756]  Go ahead.
[02:08:29.611 --> 02:08:32.172]  Yeah, some points I've been stressing recently.
[02:08:33.012 --> 02:08:39.393]  The fact is that Christianity began as an anti-imperial movement.
[02:08:39.553 --> 02:08:43.814]  The very image of the symbol of Jesus dying on the cross.
[02:08:43.914 --> 02:08:47.314]  The cross was a Roman means of crucifixion.
[02:08:47.414 --> 02:08:49.415]  Only Romans could do that.
[02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:51.095]  Throwing Christians to the lions.
[02:08:51.635 --> 02:08:55.136]  Yeah, so Jesus died as a rebel against the empire.
[02:08:55.868 --> 02:08:57.569]  No, that needs to be remembered.
[02:08:57.629 --> 02:09:07.673]  The early church was anti-imperialistic, and it's because the values of empire are almost always diametrically opposed to basic religious values.
[02:09:07.713 --> 02:09:17.458]  Oh, and by the way, Hitler tried to misinterpret Romans 13 to lay down the government, when the entire Bible says the opposite, and the prophets were almost universally killed for resisting tyranny.
[02:09:18.739 --> 02:09:21.140]  Yeah, so I tell you, I've been stressing more the
[02:09:22.372 --> 02:09:24.235]  The spiritual nature of this.
[02:09:24.535 --> 02:09:33.509]  One factor is just the very way we understand this reality that we call God or use some other term for.
[02:09:34.595 --> 02:09:37.696]  Uh, this is a, you know, a life-creating force.
[02:09:37.916 --> 02:09:40.937]  That's what the sacred reality of the universe is.
[02:09:40.977 --> 02:09:41.877]  Let me bring that up to you.
[02:09:41.897 --> 02:09:42.658]  Let me bring up a key question.
[02:09:42.678 --> 02:09:44.438]  In fact, I have this in my notes and never had asked it.
[02:09:44.738 --> 02:09:52.501]  I mean, if there isn't a dark side and a light side, look at how John Yoo says they can torture people's children sexually in front of their parents.
[02:09:52.741 --> 02:09:54.281]  That was a White House top lawyer.
[02:09:54.581 --> 02:09:59.703]  And then his commander, the Chief Counsel, went on to be Attorney General, saying they can torture people to death.
[02:10:00.383 --> 02:10:01.844]  And then Bush says he's above the law.
[02:10:01.884 --> 02:10:08.068]  I mean, this is pure darkness, Cheney running around throwing fits, screaming and cussing at people.
[02:10:08.308 --> 02:10:10.909]  I mean, clearly you can see that they serve those that love death.
[02:10:12.490 --> 02:10:20.595]  Yeah, and one of the theological bases for this is a view of the divine reality as primarily a destructive force.
[02:10:21.336 --> 02:10:28.240]  So, you know, just with the recent tornadoes, one official called it the wrath of God.
[02:10:29.631 --> 02:10:48.339]  And when people do that, given the fact that religion has to do with the desire to be in harmony with the ultimate, with the divine reality, they can convince people that by murdering, by slaughtering enemies, that they're somehow in line with the divine reality.
[02:10:48.439 --> 02:10:57.023]  But Christ said, suffer the little ones to come unto me, and it'd be better for you to throw yourself in the ocean with a big rock tied around your neck than to hurt some innocent.
[02:10:57.043 --> 02:10:58.804]  And these people just love hurting innocents.
[02:10:59.932 --> 02:11:24.553]  Yeah, so I would hope that the Christian Right would start focusing on the Christian part of that more than the right-wing part because they're using Christianity to justify policies that are diametrically opposed to any basic Christian values or values that are found in all the great religions of the world.
[02:11:25.234 --> 02:11:28.335]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:11:28.415 --> 02:11:30.796]  Let's speak with Fred in Pennsylvania.
[02:11:31.277 --> 02:11:32.477]  Fred, you're on the air.
[02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:32.877]  Welcome.
[02:11:32.897 --> 02:11:33.097]  Hi.
[02:11:33.698 --> 02:11:34.858]  Hi.
[02:11:34.898 --> 02:11:42.941]  You should keep the new phone service, Alex, because it's crystal clear on the phone link.
[02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:54.106]  I also want to talk about the possibility of everyone getting together and maybe buying a network.
[02:11:55.626 --> 02:12:03.525]  Uh, because the media model of broadcasting, we have many receivers at one point over the air.
[02:12:04.258 --> 02:12:05.919]  I think it's extremely powerful.
[02:12:06.059 --> 02:12:07.980]  What does your guest have to say about that?
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.362]  Well, number one, sir, let's say we had a couple billion dollars.
[02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:12.523]  I mean, to buy a network, probably about ten billion bucks.
[02:12:12.823 --> 02:12:17.306]  Then the FCC and others would block you and wouldn't even let you do it, would claim it was some monopoly.
[02:12:17.506 --> 02:12:18.746]  We have that with the Internet.
[02:12:18.786 --> 02:12:21.248]  We need to support alternative networks like Genesis.
[02:12:21.688 --> 02:12:27.892]  But, you know, I've heard the people out there say, oh, send me a bunch of money and we're going to start a big network, a big TV network, and it doesn't happen.
[02:12:28.192 --> 02:12:29.713]  I think the key is at grassroots level.
[02:12:29.733 --> 02:12:31.774]  But go ahead, David Ray Griffin.
[02:12:32.959 --> 02:12:41.088]  There is an alternative coming on that I don't know much about, but what I've heard thus far sounds pretty promising.
[02:12:41.268 --> 02:12:47.175]  It's an independent TV news network called The Real News.
[02:12:48.238 --> 02:12:54.963]  And I don't know enough about it to recommend it, but I think it's something worth looking into.
[02:12:54.983 --> 02:13:00.186]  Well, certainly as the spectrum of media gets larger and larger, you're going to see hundreds of new little networks forming.
[02:13:00.226 --> 02:13:08.832]  It's just that I think at the age of big centralized systems, by the nature of the direction the media is going, our dinosaurs, even Rupert Murdoch,
[02:13:09.472 --> 02:13:11.794]  Uh, has, uh, has, uh, said that.
[02:13:11.854 --> 02:13:14.015]  So I really do appreciate that caller's call.
[02:13:14.415 --> 02:13:22.160]  Let's go ahead now and talk to, I guess the next person up is Doug, uh, in, um, Arizona.
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:23.180]  You're on the air, Doug.
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:23.560]  Welcome.
[02:13:25.061 --> 02:13:25.582]  Hi, Alex.
[02:13:25.742 --> 02:13:26.742]  Hey, I love your show.
[02:13:27.002 --> 02:13:30.465]  I just, uh, a friend told me about it just a few days ago and I love it.
[02:13:31.185 --> 02:13:35.227]  Hey, what I'd like to do is I would like to make a comment about the religious aspect of 9-11.
[02:13:35.247 --> 02:13:35.748]  But first,
[02:13:37.079 --> 02:13:44.224]  Would it be okay to just touch on the subject of illegal immigration and what I feel is really coming?
[02:13:44.404 --> 02:13:49.888]  Well, the globalists are publicly using it to break down our sovereignty and drive down wages, and it doesn't help anybody but the elites.
[02:13:50.088 --> 02:13:50.809]  But sure, go ahead.
[02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:52.610]  Okay.
[02:13:53.051 --> 02:13:58.955]  Well, if you check into the UN Charter, they have divided the Earth into ten regions or kingdoms.
[02:13:59.055 --> 02:14:01.577]  And they say everybody in those regions is allowed to migrate, yeah.
[02:14:02.908 --> 02:14:03.508]  Exactly.
[02:14:03.548 --> 02:14:11.092]  So that's what they're doing is they're bringing the Mexican and the Canadians and we're all going to be one in this global, one world government.
[02:14:11.312 --> 02:14:18.296]  And what they're going to also do is they've created the problem of the illegal immigrants and that, the only way to solve that problem
[02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:22.467]  We'll be to put the injectable ID chips into those folks.
[02:14:22.507 --> 02:14:27.612]  Well, they're certainly trying to use the National ID Card as the first step towards that, so I agree with you.
[02:14:27.652 --> 02:14:28.513]  Absolutely.
[02:14:28.673 --> 02:14:29.514]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:30.215 --> 02:14:37.762]  David Ray Griffin, your comment on companies making their employees take chips, the Mexican Attorney General making his employees take chips, is that scary?
[02:14:40.604 --> 02:14:45.188]  I try to not speak about things I don't know much about, and that's something I don't know much about.
[02:14:45.208 --> 02:14:45.588]  I understand.
[02:14:45.628 --> 02:14:48.011]  You stay focused on the issue at hand.
[02:14:48.091 --> 02:14:48.831]  Okay, great.
[02:14:49.292 --> 02:14:55.378]  Let's go ahead and go to line 10, and let's speak to Chris in Arizona.
[02:14:55.458 --> 02:14:56.499]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:14:56.559 --> 02:14:56.879]  Welcome.
[02:14:58.621 --> 02:14:59.161]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:59.962 --> 02:15:04.186]  First of all, I just want to thank David Ray Griffin for coming on and doing the interview today.
[02:15:04.981 --> 02:15:09.345]  I have to agree with the caller two calls ago that said the phone lines were crystal clear.
[02:15:09.365 --> 02:15:11.848]  I've never been able to call in here so clearly.
[02:15:13.509 --> 02:15:20.516]  I wanted to mention, you know, you guys said that nobody would come on and debate you, Alex, or Ed Asner.
[02:15:21.397 --> 02:15:24.300]  And, you know, the reason for that is because they don't have any
[02:15:24.827 --> 02:15:26.247]  Well, I mean, I think that's right.
[02:15:26.267 --> 02:15:27.708]  If I were involved in the government,
[02:15:50.706 --> 02:15:55.348]  I wouldn't want to go in public and try to defend a story that I knew was false.
[02:15:57.829 --> 02:16:02.452]  So, I mean, their guilt is written all over their faces and by their actions.
[02:16:02.892 --> 02:16:05.493]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in New Hampshire.
[02:16:05.973 --> 02:16:09.035]  Sean, you're on the air with our guest, David Red-Riffin.
[02:16:09.055 --> 02:16:09.535]  Go ahead, Sean.
[02:16:10.959 --> 02:16:12.981]  Hi Alex, it's great talking to you.
[02:16:13.021 --> 02:16:14.662]  I've been trying to get on your show for a while.
[02:16:14.983 --> 02:16:32.438]  I'm an electrical engineer, and I am also a member of 9-11, Scholars for 9-11 Truth, and one of the things I wanted to point out is what I've been doing individually, I don't have a radio network like you do or something, is I go and I print out stuff from your site, and also I
[02:16:34.318 --> 02:16:39.141]  Cut CDs, and I pass them out to people individually, and I get the information out... Wonderful!
[02:16:40.001 --> 02:16:41.162]  ...hand to hand.
[02:16:41.322 --> 02:16:45.564]  I mean, I have cut down literal trees getting the information out to people.
[02:16:45.924 --> 02:16:48.546]  And also, too, I buy books by the case and give those out.
[02:16:48.906 --> 02:16:52.968]  And I'd like to recommend, too, because a lot of people... There's an army of people like you.
[02:16:53.008 --> 02:16:57.891]  There's an army of people like you saving this country and this world, potentially, so bravo, but go ahead.
[02:16:59.907 --> 02:17:12.514]  One of the books I'd like to recommend, in addition to your guest books, are The Creature from Jekyll Island, A Second Look at the Federal Reserve, and also something called The Medusafile,
[02:17:13.184 --> 02:17:16.267]  Uh, by Craig Robert who authored, uh... Yeah, we've interviewed him.
[02:17:16.327 --> 02:17:17.248]  We've interviewed him many times.
[02:17:17.308 --> 02:17:19.790]  I intend to get him back on in the near future.
[02:17:19.850 --> 02:17:22.672]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:17:23.513 --> 02:17:30.239]  Alright, we're going to, uh, come back with our final segment with David Ray Griffin and get any final comments from him.
[02:17:30.259 --> 02:17:37.485]  We'll take a few more calls and I'll continue in the last 30 minutes taking calls and getting more into this UT professor that wants to kill 90% of us.
[02:17:37.505 --> 02:17:39.206]  We got a clip of what he had to say as well.
[02:17:39.807 --> 02:17:40.728]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:17:40.748 --> 02:17:41.068]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.862 --> 02:17:48.723]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:49.083 --> 02:17:51.963]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:52.183 --> 02:17:58.385]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:17:58.765 --> 02:18:06.066]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:18:06.246 --> 02:18:10.287]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophe.
[02:18:10.627 --> 02:18:16.149]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[02:18:16.350 --> 02:18:29.475]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[02:18:38.899 --> 02:18:45.885]  803-4438 or order on the web at Berkeywater.com Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:45.905 --> 02:18:46.365]  One and the same.
[02:18:46.445 --> 02:18:51.189]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.281]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:08.541 --> 02:19:10.362]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:10.422 --> 02:19:13.463]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:14.003 --> 02:19:16.224]  Here is reality.
[02:19:16.584 --> 02:19:20.166]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:20.646 --> 02:19:24.307]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:24.868 --> 02:19:27.469]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:29.045 --> 02:19:32.770]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.582]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.103 --> 02:19:57.189]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[02:19:57.969 --> 02:20:02.953]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[02:20:03.701 --> 02:20:11.129]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[02:20:11.969 --> 02:20:15.693]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[02:20:16.554 --> 02:20:19.857]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[02:20:20.758 --> 02:20:25.162]  And offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:27.264 --> 02:20:27.704]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.764 --> 02:20:28.365]  Call now.
[02:20:28.405 --> 02:20:31.688]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:44.324 --> 02:20:46.406]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:20:46.606 --> 02:20:48.847]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:20:49.148 --> 02:20:49.808]  New toenails?
[02:20:50.189 --> 02:20:51.189]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:20:52.170 --> 02:20:54.872]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:20:55.412 --> 02:20:56.814]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:20:56.834 --> 02:20:59.636]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:20:59.856 --> 02:21:01.237]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:21:01.257 --> 02:21:03.358]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:21:03.519 --> 02:21:04.880]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:07.742]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:21:07.942 --> 02:21:09.163]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:21:09.748 --> 02:21:10.789]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:15.334]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:21:16.055 --> 02:21:16.956]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:21:17.196 --> 02:21:19.759]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:21:20.019 --> 02:21:21.681]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:21:22.161 --> 02:21:25.245]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:21:25.645 --> 02:21:26.206]  You bet.
[02:21:26.386 --> 02:21:30.510]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are gonna look just as good as yours do.
[02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:32.092]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel,
[02:21:32.552 --> 02:21:35.535]  Nonex Nail Gel, for clear, healthy looking nails.
[02:21:35.915 --> 02:21:42.281]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart, in the foot care section.
[02:21:43.602 --> 02:21:53.231]  Toll free number to join us here on Genesis, triple A, two, three, four, four, five, six, four,
[02:21:58.897 --> 02:22:00.378]  Final segment with David Ray Griffin.
[02:22:00.498 --> 02:22:02.179]  Always a great honor to have him with us.
[02:22:02.579 --> 02:22:03.659]  Take a few final calls.
[02:22:04.039 --> 02:22:09.222]  Mr. Griffin, before we take a few calls and close out here, do you think we're going to win this fight?
[02:22:09.242 --> 02:22:11.663]  I know you don't like to project into the future, but it's got to be heartening.
[02:22:12.450 --> 02:22:14.631]  I really don't know if we're going to win, of course.
[02:22:14.651 --> 02:22:15.952]  The future is indeterminate.
[02:22:15.972 --> 02:22:19.293]  But at least I have the belief that we have a chance.
[02:22:42.683 --> 02:22:44.744]  And so that's enough to work with.
[02:22:45.405 --> 02:22:47.806]  And regardless, we've got to fight and expose these murderers.
[02:22:47.906 --> 02:22:51.008]  I mean, their victims, 2,800 plus, deserve that.
[02:22:52.129 --> 02:22:52.709]  That's right.
[02:22:52.809 --> 02:22:57.452]  Even if you lose, it's important that you fought the good fight.
[02:22:58.412 --> 02:22:59.353]  I heartily agree.
[02:22:59.393 --> 02:23:02.655]  Let's talk to Matthew, calling us from North Carolina.
[02:23:03.035 --> 02:23:04.155]  Matthew, you're on the air.
[02:23:05.696 --> 02:23:06.197]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[02:23:06.437 --> 02:23:06.577]  Hi.
[02:23:07.495 --> 02:23:09.361]  I have a quick question before I get to a comment.
[02:23:09.401 --> 02:23:14.637]  Have you discussed this report that came out by the two scholars from Harvard on the power of the Israeli lobby?
[02:23:15.546 --> 02:23:16.607]  In the United States?
[02:23:16.647 --> 02:23:23.811]  Yes, that's a big AIPAC report, very scholarly, admitting that... Sir, listen, the Communist Chinese have most of our major ports and run security.
[02:23:24.131 --> 02:23:25.732]  Customs isn't allowed to investigate.
[02:23:26.073 --> 02:23:28.714]  The UAE, you know, 21 ports.
[02:23:29.595 --> 02:23:36.919]  Our highways are being taken over by the King of Spain, who owns the company Centra, to taxes the equivalent of $3 a gallon.
[02:23:36.939 --> 02:23:41.422]  I mean, it's just, we're totally being sold out to these international crime syndicates.
[02:23:41.783 --> 02:23:43.884]  Any comments on that, David Ray Griffin?
[02:23:45.680 --> 02:24:03.709]  I've been on the road and working on speeches, and I haven't had a chance to read the Walt Merzheimer piece, but it certainly has evoked enormous controversy, and it does suggest that where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:11.253]  Well, I agree with you, and I appreciate the caller's call, and I appreciate his important question.
[02:24:13.189 --> 02:24:16.311]  Next up is Daniel in Boston.
[02:24:16.351 --> 02:24:17.311]  Daniel, you're on the air.
[02:24:17.351 --> 02:24:17.732]  Go ahead.
[02:24:18.892 --> 02:24:20.773]  Alex, I want to thank you for taking my call.
[02:24:20.933 --> 02:24:28.197]  I called you about a few months ago asking about Noam Chomsky and his role as sort of the chief left gatekeeper.
[02:24:29.018 --> 02:24:30.859]  He's a real... I've debated him.
[02:24:30.899 --> 02:24:33.640]  He's a real piece of work and he just pooh-poohs everything.
[02:24:34.201 --> 02:24:34.461]  Go ahead.
[02:24:35.629 --> 02:24:37.051]  Well, listen, I know we're pressed for time.
[02:24:37.071 --> 02:24:38.153]  I wanted to say a couple of things.
[02:24:38.433 --> 02:24:41.197]  You asked me to write an article to research Professor Chomsky.
[02:24:41.237 --> 02:24:43.060]  I've done that, so I'm going to send you that article.
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:45.864]  I pulled up some of his most-choice quotes here.
[02:24:45.904 --> 02:24:48.828]  I just want to read two of them really quickly for Professor David Ray Griffin.
[02:24:49.352 --> 02:24:58.679]  On the NORAD stand down, Professor Chomsky says the following, he says, whether or not NORAD followed standard operating procedure, I have no idea, and have not investigated the matter.
[02:24:58.959 --> 02:25:02.561]  I think the case is very weak and diverts people from the really serious issues.
[02:25:02.862 --> 02:25:07.645]  So he says he hasn't, I've seen that, he says he hasn't investigated it, but we're bad to look at it.
[02:25:08.045 --> 02:25:08.906]  Let me stop you there.
[02:25:09.146 --> 02:25:15.050]  Professor Griffin, he's out there telling us all to shut up, and it's not an inside job, and what do you think of that?
[02:25:18.055 --> 02:25:19.735]  You know, it's a complex issue.
[02:25:19.755 --> 02:25:21.896]  Noam Chomsky is a great man.
[02:25:21.976 --> 02:25:24.457]  He's done so much good.
[02:25:24.477 --> 02:25:29.938]  I think we have to say everybody is entitled to a few errors.
[02:25:30.338 --> 02:25:32.919]  But he's on the Defense Department payroll.
[02:25:32.959 --> 02:25:33.519]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:25:33.959 --> 02:25:39.061]  On the other hand, I would say that he's just completely wrong on this.
[02:25:39.221 --> 02:25:44.462]  I saw a letter that he had written to someone trying to get him involved in this.
[02:25:45.447 --> 02:25:57.803]  And, uh, Chomsky, one of his, uh, reasons for saying this really wasn't very important was that only 3,000 people were killed and far more have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:25:58.264 --> 02:25:59.445]  Well, of course that's true.
[02:25:59.565 --> 02:26:01.528]  But this is the foundation for that!
[02:26:01.708 --> 02:26:03.711]  That's right, and that seems so obvious.
[02:26:04.805 --> 02:26:07.426]  Um, that, uh, it's just very puzzling.
[02:26:07.706 --> 02:26:09.466]  Well, I gotta be honest with you, Professor.
[02:26:09.546 --> 02:26:15.808]  I debated him for an hour, and I mean, I've talked to a lot of professors, a lot of people that are just esteemed, and I really respect, like yourself.
[02:26:16.388 --> 02:26:19.009]  I've interviewed Nobel laureates in science routinely.
[02:26:19.249 --> 02:26:21.450]  This guy, he just didn't know anything.
[02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:23.531]  And I'm tired of hearing how smart he is.
[02:26:23.571 --> 02:26:24.411]  He's a guy that's a joke.
[02:26:24.451 --> 02:26:24.911]  I'm sorry.
[02:26:25.939 --> 02:26:52.212]  Well, you can be very smart and be ignorant about certain things that you, as a matter of principle, refuse to investigate, and that seems to be his attitude here, because he has a view that's called structuralism, that leads him to believe that the government simply wouldn't do this sort of thing because they don't need to, and he thinks that people who are involved in talking about conspiracy are individualists.
[02:26:52.827 --> 02:26:55.510]  So he has a principle reason for doing it.
[02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:57.011]  I just happen to think he's wrong.
[02:26:57.091 --> 02:27:04.278]  But as you say, it is religious in that I choose not to believe it so I don't look at it, but then I tell you you're wrong without looking at it.
[02:27:04.318 --> 02:27:06.720]  David Ray Griffin, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:07.621]  Stay there, caller.
[02:27:07.641 --> 02:27:09.503]  I'm going to let you finish up on Chomsky on the other side.
[02:27:09.523 --> 02:27:13.647]  We've got a lot of other news to cover, and we'll talk to Casey and Brandon and Tim and others.
[02:27:14.427 --> 02:27:16.790]  But Professor Griffin, thank you so much, sir.
[02:27:17.498 --> 02:27:18.319]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:27:18.399 --> 02:27:18.799]  Keep it up.

[02:27:20.701 --> 02:27:22.442]  I'd like to talk to you off-air for just a second.
[02:27:22.922 --> 02:27:25.945]  And so, just Godspeed, and we'll see you in the future.
[02:27:25.965 --> 02:27:32.990]  Okay.
[02:27:34.011 --> 02:27:34.931]  We're on the march.

[02:29:47.407 --> 02:29:50.809]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:50.989 --> 02:29:54.471]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[02:29:54.719 --> 02:29:57.940]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:03.463]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[02:30:03.503 --> 02:30:08.765]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:08.945 --> 02:30:13.127]  Now, going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:13.267 --> 02:30:14.608]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:30:14.648 --> 02:30:20.030]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:20.530 --> 02:30:24.971]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:25.052 --> 02:30:26.412]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:26.592 --> 02:30:30.053]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:30.073 --> 02:30:31.053]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:46.369 --> 02:30:52.395]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:52.995 --> 02:30:55.998]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.639 --> 02:30:59.180]  Alright, folks.
[02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:03.144]  I'm gonna take four or five, maybe even more calls.
[02:31:04.777 --> 02:31:17.006]  And I want to spend about five minutes at least just recapping and adding some more data to this Professor Death, this pianka, who says 90% of us need to die or die now, and how that ties into the globalist operation here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:17.046 --> 02:31:31.355]  But I was listening on the radio the other day and heard an old Guns N' Roses song, and it talks about how when Kennedy got killed, you know, when I learned the truth, you know, basically woke me up and then made me kind of go into my shell.
[02:31:31.415 --> 02:31:32.016]  It talks about
[02:31:32.754 --> 02:31:33.395]  What we've got here is
[02:31:59.892 --> 02:32:01.853]  Failure to communicate.
[02:32:01.993 --> 02:32:06.556]  Some men you just can't reach.
[02:32:06.636 --> 02:32:11.740]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants.
[02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:13.040]  Well, he is.
[02:32:13.241 --> 02:32:14.681]  I don't like it anymore.
[02:32:27.887 --> 02:32:41.383]  Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before
[02:32:47.490 --> 02:32:57.938]  Look at the hate we're breeding.
[02:32:58.118 --> 02:33:01.221]  Look at the fear we're feeding.
[02:33:01.501 --> 02:33:04.843]  Look at the lives we're leading.
[02:33:04.903 --> 02:33:08.426]  The way we've always done before.
[02:34:18.450 --> 02:34:21.793]  I don't care when they shot the man who's sick.
[02:34:21.853 --> 02:34:23.714]  Peace could last forever.
[02:34:23.874 --> 02:34:25.735]  I need my first memories.
[02:34:25.815 --> 02:34:27.836]  They shot Kennedy.
[02:34:28.137 --> 02:34:30.959]  I went numb when I learned to speak.
[02:34:31.059 --> 02:34:33.960]  So I never fell for Vietnam.
[02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:42.406]  We've got the wall of disease to remind us all that you can't trust freedom when it's not in your fist.
[02:35:03.712 --> 02:35:11.533]  Welcome back!
[02:35:16.454 --> 02:35:19.515]  Alright, well, uh... That's Guns N' Roses, isn't it?
[02:35:19.535 --> 02:35:20.235]  What's the name of that song?
[02:35:20.295 --> 02:35:20.895]  Civil War.
[02:35:21.135 --> 02:35:21.715]  It's part of it.
[02:35:21.735 --> 02:35:22.215]  It goes on.
[02:35:22.235 --> 02:35:24.516]  I was writing notes during it.
[02:35:25.676 --> 02:35:29.856]  Brainwashed masses, for the love of God and civil rights, wake up.
[02:35:30.697 --> 02:35:31.457]  Look at the hate.
[02:35:31.697 --> 02:35:32.957]  Look at the fear we're breeding.
[02:35:34.338 --> 02:35:38.120]  When he learned about the men who shot Kennedy, the men, plural.
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:40.501]  When he learned the scene, he went numb.
[02:35:40.521 --> 02:35:45.723]  I mean, he goes on and on, and it's just about the New World Order and the government waging war against the people.
[02:35:47.123 --> 02:35:48.744]  And we all instinctively know this.
[02:35:48.764 --> 02:35:55.027]  We all instinctively understand that, unless we're on the Defense Department MIT payroll, like Noam Chomsky.
[02:35:55.627 --> 02:35:58.048]  Okay, I believe it was Daniel in Boston that was bringing that up.
[02:35:58.088 --> 02:36:00.729]  Let's try to go back to him and see if he's still there.
[02:36:01.089 --> 02:36:02.650]  Daniel, you want to finish up your comments?
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:06.462]  Alex, I'm here and I want to thank you for giving me a towel on the other end.
[02:36:06.762 --> 02:36:13.126]  I'm going to try to fit in a couple quotes about Professor Chomsky and this is all part of the article that I'm going to send you today.
[02:36:13.206 --> 02:36:15.148]  Send it to Ryan at InfoWars.com.
[02:36:15.208 --> 02:36:19.811]  Send it to Paul over on the present planet at email to make sure we get it posted.
[02:36:21.599 --> 02:36:23.481]  Let me read a couple of choice quotes.
[02:36:23.581 --> 02:36:30.050]  I want to make it clear that it would be one thing if Noam Chomsky were to say, well, some of these points are controversial, I have yet to investigate them, but it's beyond that.
[02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:32.353]  Let me just add this.
[02:36:32.373 --> 02:36:37.740]  A lot of people attack me on the web because I, five years ago or so, attacked him when he was on the show.
[02:36:38.593 --> 02:36:40.256]  Because the guy was full of baloney.
[02:36:40.336 --> 02:36:41.678]  I mean, I really know my facts.
[02:36:42.339 --> 02:36:46.206]  And he was intellectually dishonest, and they worship him when he gives these speeches.
[02:36:46.586 --> 02:36:49.732]  He only gives people half the paradigm, and he knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:36:49.772 --> 02:36:50.753]  The guy is bad news.
[02:36:51.034 --> 02:36:51.455]  So go ahead.
[02:36:52.581 --> 02:36:55.363]  Well, listen, I'm a college student, so I've encountered this.
[02:36:55.403 --> 02:36:58.986]  I know that most of the social activists have been brainwashed by these left gate keepers.
[02:36:59.006 --> 02:37:00.007]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:37:00.027 --> 02:37:01.868]  So let me read you a quote here by the professor.
[02:37:01.888 --> 02:37:07.633]  He says, on 9-11, he says, if the left spends any time on this, that's the end of the left, in my opinion.
[02:37:07.893 --> 02:37:10.015]  The mainstream would be utterly delighted.
[02:37:10.255 --> 02:37:13.317]  It is highly unlikely that anything significant will be found.
[02:37:13.597 --> 02:37:19.382]  And if it is, which I greatly doubt something found, which would quickly send everyone in Washington
[02:37:19.907 --> 02:37:24.129]  In Washington, the death chamber, the left is unlikely to emerge triumphant.
[02:37:24.189 --> 02:37:30.353]  On Operation Northwood, he says, Operation Northwood is only one of the many examples for being skeptical about your theory.
[02:37:30.533 --> 02:37:31.633]  It doesn't even come close.
[02:37:31.673 --> 02:37:32.674]  It was not carried out.
[02:37:33.054 --> 02:37:34.795]  He says, nothing empirical is impossible.
[02:37:34.855 --> 02:37:38.197]  Thus, it's conceivable that everyone in the White House is totally insane.
[02:37:38.417 --> 02:37:43.620]  And in my opinion, it would have had to have been to try something that would have very likely turned into an utter fiasco.
[02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:45.881]  A sudden miracle could have succeeded.
[02:37:48.547 --> 02:37:50.248]  Well, your cell phone cut out, sir.
[02:37:50.788 --> 02:37:51.688]  I appreciate your call.
[02:37:51.708 --> 02:37:52.729]  Yeah, I've read most of that.
[02:37:52.789 --> 02:37:54.029]  I've seen the stuff he puts out.
[02:37:55.350 --> 02:37:57.251]  And, I mean, what do you say to that?
[02:37:58.651 --> 02:37:59.351]  What do you say to that?
[02:37:59.471 --> 02:38:05.254]  Operation Northwoods was an operational plan, not some war game that they tried to greenlight that was almost executed.
[02:38:05.794 --> 02:38:09.415]  It was greenlighted by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to go operational.
[02:38:10.496 --> 02:38:10.896]  Okay?
[02:38:11.776 --> 02:38:17.299]  That's like if I decide to go rob the bank and I'm about to walk in the door with a gun and a cop walks over and stops me.
[02:38:17.439 --> 02:38:18.119]  And that was Kennedy.
[02:38:19.818 --> 02:38:21.963]  Still, I'm going to go to prison for attempted bank robbery.
[02:38:22.744 --> 02:38:24.648]  And that plan got nixed.
[02:38:25.349 --> 02:38:30.540]  And then you've got the executional plans, Ajax and Iran, admittedly declassified.
[02:38:31.306 --> 02:38:32.387]  The Gulf of Tonkin staged.
[02:38:33.127 --> 02:38:36.329]  We have the USS Liberty executed, which is right out of Northwoods.
[02:38:36.429 --> 02:38:41.552]  Blowing up ships, blaming it on people, mass shootings, bombings, how to blame Patsy's.
[02:38:41.993 --> 02:38:44.034]  Yeah, and then Chomsky just hopes you don't read it.
[02:38:44.054 --> 02:38:46.135]  Look, I don't just sit here and attack him for no reason.
[02:38:46.155 --> 02:38:47.296]  The guy's a piece of trash!
[02:38:47.876 --> 02:38:49.037]  He's a sniveling joke!
[02:38:49.237 --> 02:38:50.378]  He's not even smart!
[02:38:50.658 --> 02:38:53.820]  There are other professors exposing the globalists that are a hundred times better.
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:55.101]  He believes in globalism.
[02:38:55.121 --> 02:38:58.463]  He says the UN is going to save us when it's bankrolled by the very same corporations.
[02:38:59.003 --> 02:38:59.744]  He knows that!
[02:39:00.545 --> 02:39:01.731]  Chomsky is a joke!
[02:39:02.676 --> 02:39:03.922]  I'm tired of these people!
[02:39:04.884 --> 02:39:05.844]  Now you're getting me really mad.
[02:39:05.864 --> 02:39:08.505]  He is so arrogant when he speaks.
[02:39:08.825 --> 02:39:10.126]  He is on such a power trip.
[02:39:10.146 --> 02:39:15.007]  And a lot of people take that arrogant smacking and that authoritativeness as intelligence.
[02:39:15.727 --> 02:39:18.468]  We see it by the peak oil people on the 9-11 side of the debate.
[02:39:18.708 --> 02:39:25.450]  We need to get rid of billions and stop talking about 9-11.
[02:39:26.671 --> 02:39:29.071]  Let's go ahead here and just take a few more calls.
[02:39:29.091 --> 02:39:31.472]  Tim, in New York City, you're on the air.
[02:39:36.355 --> 02:39:37.957]  Oh, sorry, it's Upstate New York.
[02:39:38.017 --> 02:39:43.021]  I listen to you on the Sunshine Radio Network, and Dr. Wolf is the one who brought me to life.
[02:39:44.142 --> 02:39:50.768]  We need to understand about the incorporated church that is keeping the people quiet.
[02:39:50.828 --> 02:39:55.993]  They can't talk about politics, and someday you need to look at a show on that.
[02:39:56.113 --> 02:39:58.635]  But, number one, this is my reason for calling.
[02:39:59.347 --> 02:40:02.670]  Uh, there's a place called The Little Theater in Rochester, New York.
[02:40:02.890 --> 02:40:09.076]  I am sponsoring Showing Loose Change 2 on April 18th at 7pm.
[02:40:09.897 --> 02:40:10.277]  Great!
[02:40:10.297 --> 02:40:13.900]  We're getting, well, I rented the theater and- Where is that?
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.142]  No, no, no.
[02:40:16.282 --> 02:40:20.907]  It's in downtown Rochester at 240 East Avenue.
[02:40:20.927 --> 02:40:22.008]  Excellent!
[02:40:22.028 --> 02:40:23.429]  Right in downtown Rochester.
[02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.970]  Excellent.
[02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:30.253]  We're going to try and we need to get people out there to support us because we want to do this more.
[02:40:30.333 --> 02:40:33.795]  We're looking every two to three weeks at getting a film on.
[02:40:34.135 --> 02:40:34.796]  Good.
[02:40:35.316 --> 02:40:37.497]  I hope you'll show Marshall Law or Road to Jeremy sometime.
[02:40:38.985 --> 02:40:44.326]  Oh, Road to Tyranny is the next one on the list if we can get people to come out and support us.
[02:40:44.646 --> 02:40:45.406]  Good, good.
[02:40:45.566 --> 02:40:50.327]  Alright, well listen, I really appreciate your call and it's exciting to hear that stuff's going on.
[02:40:50.367 --> 02:40:54.368]  By the way, we carry Loose Change 2, an excellent film, at InfoWars.com.
[02:40:55.148 --> 02:40:56.869]  You can go to the online video bookstore and get that.
[02:40:56.889 --> 02:41:03.570]  You get Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, The Book, Descent into Tyranny, Order Out of Chaos, Least Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order.
[02:41:04.010 --> 02:41:05.450]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:41:05.490 --> 02:41:07.411]  We're extending it for another week and then that's it.
[02:41:07.971 --> 02:41:08.651]  Actually, less than a week.
[02:41:09.742 --> 02:41:11.455]  Until April 10th, we are extending it.
[02:41:12.555 --> 02:41:20.340]  And you can go and get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv for all 14 of my films, my weekly TV show, the video reports.
[02:41:20.380 --> 02:41:20.901]  It's all there.
[02:41:21.261 --> 02:41:21.861]  Such a great deal.
[02:41:21.921 --> 02:41:26.164]  PrisonPlanet.tv or call toll free to get any of the films, hard copies of them.
[02:41:26.424 --> 02:41:27.485]  Be sure and get them and make copies.
[02:41:27.505 --> 02:41:27.845]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:41:27.865 --> 02:41:36.091]  Okay, and I'm sorry I'm moving quicker, but I've got to cover some news here in just a minute that I haven't detailed enough.
[02:41:36.931 --> 02:41:39.873]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cliff in Utah.
[02:41:40.193 --> 02:41:41.094]  Cliff, you're on the air.
[02:41:42.423 --> 02:41:43.404]  How you doing there, Alex?
[02:41:43.524 --> 02:41:46.927]  I've been in this fight with you a long time, and I'd like to say something real fast.
[02:41:47.788 --> 02:42:01.940]  I think everybody, all the lonely patriots out there, ought to buy two tickets to the National Lottery, and if one of us wins, we need to sue the New World Order, because they're on record now, the Bush Administration, and start a bunch of private radio stations to spread the word.
[02:42:03.241 --> 02:42:04.262]  Well, that's interesting, sir.
[02:42:04.282 --> 02:42:07.625]  You know, I'm not a fan of gambling, so I can't... But it is funny.
[02:42:07.665 --> 02:42:08.926]  I mean, it is an interesting idea.
[02:42:10.231 --> 02:42:11.334]  I'm not either, Alex.
[02:42:11.374 --> 02:42:13.899]  In fact, I don't gamble, but I'm sure gonna try this.
[02:42:14.039 --> 02:42:18.870]  And, uh, if everybody just buy two tickets, all us lonely patriots out here...
[02:42:19.518 --> 02:42:24.260]  And one of us that happened to win, we could get this thing over with real quick like, and I'm sure going to try.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:25.941]  All right, sir, I hear you.
[02:42:25.981 --> 02:42:27.021]  That's an interesting idea.
[02:42:27.081 --> 02:42:29.122]  I appreciate that call.
[02:42:29.422 --> 02:42:39.867]  But you know, that sits on hitting the jackpot, or sits on that idea of beating them all at once, and that sits, that kind of rests on the idea of then having luck to win the lottery.
[02:42:40.127 --> 02:42:41.847]  And I believe most lotteries are staged.
[02:42:43.168 --> 02:42:44.369]  And let me get something straight here.
[02:42:44.509 --> 02:42:47.730]  I'll, maybe once a year, I do it every weekend if I could, you know,
[02:42:48.593 --> 02:42:49.514]  I love a poker game.
[02:42:50.294 --> 02:42:55.118]  Nothing wrong with going and betting a few dollars or piles of quarters just to make it fun.
[02:42:56.172 --> 02:43:03.358]  The reason I don't like gambling is that I line up to try to buy milk, say, at 10 o'clock at night on a Friday night, because my wife calls me and says, bring some milk home, honey.
[02:43:03.758 --> 02:43:06.520]  And I see all these poor people lined up buying tickets.
[02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:08.562]  They buy three or four, and they go, oh, I've got to have three or four more.
[02:43:09.062 --> 02:43:10.683]  And they scratch those and come back in.
[02:43:10.703 --> 02:43:13.646]  And you just see that while you're gassing your car up or whatever.
[02:43:13.666 --> 02:43:14.366]  You can witness it.
[02:43:15.087 --> 02:43:21.632]  And there might be 5, 10 people, sometimes 20, if it's the big lottery night, lined up just hoping, above all hope, they're going to win.
[02:43:22.714 --> 02:43:39.681]  Whereas if they took that money and invested it in a little business, maybe a tire repair place or cleaning people's windshields and invested it over the years or mowing lawns and got enough money to hire a few helpers, they could end up living in a $200,000 house and going on vacations, putting their kids through college.
[02:43:39.721 --> 02:43:42.602]  I got a lot of friends that got degrees and they run lawn companies now.
[02:43:44.763 --> 02:43:46.384]  They run lawn companies now and make a living.
[02:43:48.281 --> 02:43:51.162]  But instead, my problem is it hits the poor.
[02:43:51.402 --> 02:43:53.623]  Hey, you've got millions of dollars, you want to go gamble?
[02:43:53.643 --> 02:43:56.604]  I mean, that's basically what fishing is.
[02:43:56.884 --> 02:43:57.784]  Humans like that.
[02:43:57.964 --> 02:44:01.626]  We like throwing the spear and seeing if we hit the monkey and we get to eat it or whatever.
[02:44:02.006 --> 02:44:02.846]  Or, you know, hit the bird.
[02:44:02.866 --> 02:44:06.007]  That's what's so much fun about bass fishing.
[02:44:06.027 --> 02:44:08.028]  You're kind of gambling, but you're using some skill.
[02:44:08.068 --> 02:44:08.628]  Where are the fish?
[02:44:08.648 --> 02:44:09.248]  Are you going to get it?
[02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:13.507]  They found gambling manipulates a key enzyme in the brain.
[02:44:13.567 --> 02:44:14.951]  I mean, so it's a very natural thing.
[02:44:14.991 --> 02:44:15.853]  It's very destructive.
[02:44:15.873 --> 02:44:18.399]  I mean, look at the Romans, you know, playing dice over Christ's cloak.
[02:44:20.388 --> 02:44:49.697]  I remember one time, there's a casino right down the road from where the network was based in Minnesota, an Indian Casino, and that was the cheapest hotel that was nice, put me in, so Ted Harrison put me up and out with my wife, and I waddled on downstairs, and I got, you know, I play a little blackjack, my wife won, but I just keep playing because, so I'm not saying, you know, like, oh my gosh, if you gamble, you're going to go to hell, it's just, it's really disruptive and bad, and I see our whole economy kind of switching over to this, and
[02:44:51.127 --> 02:44:52.347]  I just don't know what to say about it.
[02:44:56.288 --> 02:45:04.010]  It's just there's tried and true ways to make money, and if you knew the statistics of winning the lottery, and then if you knew the fraud involved with it, I mean, it's been proven state by state.
[02:45:05.470 --> 02:45:07.290]  It's a mafia thing, and it's just a joke.
[02:45:08.491 --> 02:45:09.611]  Okay, I've said enough.
[02:45:09.691 --> 02:45:14.212]  I'm just going to take two more calls, because let's just jam through them quickly, we'll see how many we get to.
[02:45:14.752 --> 02:45:16.772]  Robert in Texas, you're on the air, Robert, go ahead.
[02:45:16.792 --> 02:45:19.453]  Hi Alex, first time caller.
[02:45:19.673 --> 02:45:20.193]  Welcome, sir.
[02:45:21.815 --> 02:45:29.909]  I just wanted to let you know that there's a website called archive.org and you might be able to find the stuff that CIA took down on that website.
[02:45:29.949 --> 02:45:32.133]  They pretty much back up the entire internet.
[02:45:32.914 --> 02:45:35.519]  Oh I know and they've got a bunch of my films up there too.
[02:45:37.179 --> 02:45:44.527]  Okay, and the only other thing I wanted to say was that this weekend, a little bit west of Austin, is a big festival in Dripping Springs, Texas.
[02:45:45.087 --> 02:45:51.454]  And I was going to pass out some flyers to do, you know, to promote you, but I don't know what exactly I should put on them.
[02:45:51.474 --> 02:45:54.817]  Do you have something on your site that I could... I got an idea!
[02:45:54.837 --> 02:46:00.343]  Get a prisonplanet.tv membership, or if you have any of my original DVDs, because they're higher quality, burn 50 copies of that.
[02:46:01.081 --> 02:46:01.341]  Yeah, hi.
[02:46:01.361 --> 02:46:02.222]  I just have some questions.
[02:46:02.302 --> 02:46:04.784]  I've been reading the re-open 9-11 website and their theories on the blue screen.
[02:46:24.632 --> 02:46:28.354]  Yeah, I totally disagree with that.
[02:46:28.414 --> 02:46:30.935]  It's a red herring and very destructive and not based on reality.
[02:46:31.196 --> 02:46:33.257]  Blue screens, holograms, give me a break.
[02:46:33.317 --> 02:46:35.778]  But, you know, I don't spend my time attacking those ridiculous theories.
[02:46:36.118 --> 02:46:36.858]  I just ignore it.
[02:46:36.899 --> 02:46:38.980]  I cover the real things we can follow and document.
[02:46:40.981 --> 02:46:41.181]  Thank you.
[02:46:41.641 --> 02:46:42.021]  Thank you.
[02:46:42.141 --> 02:46:43.782]  You've got to really, really watch it.
[02:46:45.003 --> 02:46:45.683]  Last caller.
[02:46:45.743 --> 02:46:47.344]  Let's talk to Sean in New Hampshire.
[02:46:48.044 --> 02:46:48.845]  Sean, you're on the air.
[02:46:48.885 --> 02:46:49.205]  Go ahead.
[02:46:50.140 --> 02:47:04.137]  Hi Alex, I wanted to mention real quick, I didn't get to mention it before, I have in my hands the metallurgical analysis done by Dr. Frank Gale, and I passed that out, and I've emailed that to you, I wish you could put it on your site.
[02:47:04.277 --> 02:47:08.662]  Well we have underwater laboratories engineered that looked at it saying it's impossible, and it's made up to.
[02:47:09.082 --> 02:47:10.204]  They are underwrote the building.
[02:47:10.948 --> 02:47:21.179]  And you can see the electron micrograph of the steel and know that none of them got, none of the steel got above the temperature of an ordinary commercial oven.
[02:47:21.739 --> 02:47:26.484]  Okay, so therefore... Yeah, why doesn't the oven, why doesn't the oven melt?
[02:47:26.564 --> 02:47:26.985]  Exactly.
[02:47:28.286 --> 02:47:29.347]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:29.547 --> 02:47:37.171]  And the temperatures that the steel did reach were more than a thousand degrees short centigrade.
[02:47:37.531 --> 02:47:38.172]  Of even reddening.
[02:47:38.212 --> 02:47:40.313]  By having the steel weakened from temperature.
[02:47:40.453 --> 02:47:47.377]  Yeah, of reddening to just become somewhat elastic, meaning you could maybe beat it into shape with a large hammer.
[02:47:48.604 --> 02:47:49.525]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:49.885 --> 02:48:09.806]  And, uh, also, too, the, uh, architectural, um, uh, requirements for that is the theoretical, uh, the actual maximum load for a floor was, uh, uh, one-sixth of the theoretical, according to the engineering... Sir, we know they blew up, we know they blew up Tower 1 and 2, and they certainly blew up 7 way down the street that was only hit by some dust.
[02:48:10.717 --> 02:48:29.163]  Yes, and appendix, section 8 of appendix C of the FEMA report says that there is severe oxidation and sulfidication of the steel, which is an unusual event for the fire, and of course it's entirely ignored, and that can only be produced by RDX or a thermite explosive that is meant to take out steel.
[02:48:29.683 --> 02:48:30.303]  Exactly.
[02:48:30.323 --> 02:48:34.965]  But forget the facts, they can't debate us on those, so they won't.
[02:48:36.201 --> 02:48:37.983]  They blew that building up right in front of you.
[02:48:38.003 --> 02:48:39.104]  They overreached.
[02:48:39.444 --> 02:48:40.945]  We're going to defeat them!
[02:48:41.245 --> 02:48:42.847]  We're going to bring them to justice!
[02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:49.913]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.173 --> 02:48:51.754]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:48:57.099 --> 02:49:03.845]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.165 --> 02:49:06.125]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.346 --> 02:49:09.186]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.266 --> 02:49:13.947]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.147 --> 02:49:18.568]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.788 --> 02:49:25.990]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:50:03.030 --> 02:50:07.232]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:07.512 --> 02:50:11.454]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:11.694 --> 02:50:18.197]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:18.417 --> 02:50:23.899]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[02:51:45.546 --> 02:51:49.628]  As promised, here is Dr. Pianca, the local whitewash newscast.
[02:51:49.648 --> 02:51:50.928]  He didn't really mean it.
[02:51:50.968 --> 02:51:51.489]  Here it is.
[02:51:52.889 --> 02:51:54.530]  This is your news at six.
[02:51:55.834 --> 02:52:02.601]  Well, reports of a University of Texas scientist's plans for mass extermination of the human race got our attention today.
[02:52:02.761 --> 02:52:10.369]  So, tonight we're getting to the bottom of a controversial theory that is spawning death threats on campus and controversy across the country.
[02:52:10.790 --> 02:52:13.873]  Keg fans, Rich Parsons is live at UT with more Rich.
[02:52:14.750 --> 02:52:17.173]  Michelle, this has been the buzz around campus all day.
[02:52:17.493 --> 02:52:22.639]  Some are accusing a UT professor of advocating genocide as a way to control the world's population.
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:23.800]  Sound crazy?
[02:52:24.021 --> 02:52:29.607]  Well, the professor, whose ideas are under scrutiny, says, yeah, it sounds crazy, because it's not true.
[02:52:30.914 --> 02:52:37.218]  Well, let's see if I can see if there's enough... Dr. Eric Pionka does not want everyone on Earth dead.
[02:52:37.638 --> 02:52:39.680]  I don't bear any ill will towards anybody.
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:44.463]  But many do bear ill will towards this soft-spoken University of Texas ecologist.
[02:52:44.783 --> 02:52:46.224]  I've got a really great death threat.
[02:52:46.584 --> 02:52:53.869]  He's getting death threats like this one threatening the slaughter of his family after recent speeches pushing for population control.
[02:52:53.889 --> 02:52:57.311]  If we don't control our population, microbes will.
[02:52:59.455 --> 02:53:03.859]  Why do we have these lethal microbes that kill humans in the first place?
[02:53:04.359 --> 02:53:06.321]  The answer is there's too many of us.
[02:53:06.361 --> 02:53:12.146]  Dr. Bianca says he would never advocate genocide or extermination like some suggest he does.
[02:53:12.546 --> 02:53:14.488]  I've got two granddaughters, man.
[02:53:14.768 --> 02:53:17.931]  I'm putting money in a college fund for my granddaughters.
[02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:19.731]  I'm worried about him.
[02:53:20.191 --> 02:53:25.535]  He believes criticism of his theory about an inevitable plague on mankind comes from a rival.
[02:53:26.195 --> 02:53:30.698]  Jealous about his Distinguished Scientist Award from the Texas Academy of Science.
[02:53:30.718 --> 02:53:35.881]  He's an avowed enemy and he's made this very clear that he's going to get me and take me down.
[02:53:36.402 --> 02:53:41.965]  But Dr. Pianka has the full backing of UT behind him, as radical as his ideas may seem.
[02:53:42.325 --> 02:53:45.968]  We have a lot of different points of view on the University of Texas at Austin campus.
[02:53:46.949 --> 02:53:51.373]  And we certainly support our faculty in saying what they think.
[02:53:51.893 --> 02:53:59.940]  After 50 years of ecological study and authoring nearly 20 books, Dr. Pianka thinks the world's in trouble and just wants everyone to know.
[02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:03.223]  We're taking over the earth and not leaving anything for anything else.
[02:54:03.243 --> 02:54:03.724]  That's enough!
[02:54:04.284 --> 02:54:04.944]  We're out of time.
[02:54:04.984 --> 02:54:06.064]  I'll play the rest tomorrow.
[02:54:06.104 --> 02:54:10.806]  And by the way, the transcripts of his speeches where he did say all of this are now available.
[02:54:11.526 --> 02:54:12.946]  And recordings are now available.
[02:54:13.246 --> 02:54:14.366]  And these are going out.
[02:54:14.867 --> 02:54:21.348]  And major newspapers and scientific papers are reporting that he got a 95% standing ovation.
[02:54:21.728 --> 02:54:23.469]  He did say 90% of us need to die.
[02:54:25.669 --> 02:54:27.391]  He did say Ebola is ideal.
[02:54:27.871 --> 02:54:31.834]  He did tell people to turn their cameras off and not to tape it because the world isn't ready.
[02:54:32.075 --> 02:54:37.659]  You can hear his tremulous voice of that creature as he's freaking out as people learn what he's pushing.
[02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:39.841]  And he's pushing the same thing the government's pushing.
[02:54:39.861 --> 02:54:43.124]  Go read our analysis at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:43.914 --> 02:54:45.335]  He is trying to backpedal.
[02:54:45.975 --> 02:54:52.298]  And there are prestigious reports and eyewitnesses and multiple scientists filing official complaints with him over what he said.
[02:54:52.338 --> 02:55:02.282]  And the chairman of the Environmental Sciences Division of the Texas Academy of Scientists, who was there and is on the board, is one of our witnesses, but now we have the tapes.
[02:55:02.322 --> 02:55:06.344]  He was in the Statesman Saturday with his Ebola plush toy saying how great it would be.
[02:55:07.594 --> 02:55:10.677]  But when the light gets shined on these cockroaches, they freak out.
[02:55:10.977 --> 02:55:15.141]  And I guarantee you those emails said things like, Hey, if it's so great, how about your family?
[02:55:15.521 --> 02:55:16.662]  That isn't a death threat.
[02:55:17.483 --> 02:55:26.531]  It's just like the Scripps Hour News Service claimed I sent her an email calling her a whore, and then I made Scripps Hour News Service retract it because it turned out they looked at it and it wasn't even true.
[02:55:26.931 --> 02:55:27.532]  Made up.
[02:55:27.912 --> 02:55:29.374]  Straw man attacks.
[02:55:29.454 --> 02:55:32.877]  I guarantee you the emails he's getting are, Hey, if it's such a great idea, how about you go?
[02:55:34.384 --> 02:55:35.725]  Oh, but no, they know best.
[02:55:35.745 --> 02:55:36.526]  They're the guardians.
[02:55:36.866 --> 02:55:37.186]  They're the 10%.
[02:55:37.706 --> 02:55:40.168]  He says he, quote, loves the police state of China.
