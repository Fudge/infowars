[00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:07.814]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio experience like no other.
[00:00:08.834 --> 00:00:10.675]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:13.016]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:14.476]  Defending our borders.
[00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:16.517]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:17.938]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.599]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.700]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.161]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:26.881]  Call Alex now.
[00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:27.962]  Toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:36.642]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.111]  Absolutely, my friends.
[00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:44.754]  I am excited to be here.
[00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:47.538]  The first official syndicated broadcast from the historical...
[00:00:48.678 --> 00:00:49.279]  We're good to go.
[00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.059]  We're good to go.
[00:01:43.038 --> 00:01:47.321]  But we're glad somebody's here filling in for them while they drive like maniacs to get here.
[00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:48.862]  No, seriously, don't speed.
[00:01:48.902 --> 00:01:49.763]  Everything's all right.
[00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:51.064]  We want you to drive safe.
[00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:56.948]  Number one cause of death in this country is automobiles, but you don't hear about a war on the automobile, and I don't think there should be one.
[00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:02.172]  You hear about a war on terror, because the war on terror is being used to take your liberties, to take your freedoms.
[00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:03.413]  All right, let's get serious.
[00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:07.576]  Let's dispense with the pleasantries and get down to brass tacks.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.000]  We're good to go.
[00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.900]  I'm going to pay you to put a microphone or camera in your house.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.761]  Unless it was a lot of money, or unless you were a freak, I'd say 99% of you would say no, hell no, and kick you out of their house, kick you out of their front door.
[00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:48.162]  Not anymore, folks.
[00:02:48.262 --> 00:02:49.502]  You don't have a choice.
[00:02:49.622 --> 00:02:56.824]  They're doing this, and I got an email saying I'm a liar, because I was mentioning a story that we reported on a few months ago.
[00:02:57.124 --> 00:03:02.505]  Two weeks ago, I was just mentioning it, and somebody thought I was lying, a listener, so I thought I'd go pull the reports.
[00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:03.666]  We're good to go.
[00:03:03.686 --> 00:03:04.227]  We're good to go.
[00:03:22.924 --> 00:03:23.565]  We're good to go.
[00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:44.692]  We're good to go.
[00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.251]  We're good to go.
[00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:23.911]  They totally lie to you.
[00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:25.652]  They claim they make Jews wear yellow stars.
[00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:28.936]  Total fabrication, right out of the bowels of the CIA.
[00:04:29.256 --> 00:04:32.719]  We're going to go over this today, but I am worried about North Korea.
[00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.421]  That's why nobody's going to be attacking them.
[00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:37.324]  Any real threat to this country is left completely alone.
[00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:43.210]  Anybody with oil, who's got a pushover military like Iraq or Iran, compared to places like China and Russia.
[00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.772]  We'll be picked on, we'll be bombed, and everyone will, of course, jump around loving it.
[00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:48.872]  Well, I shouldn't say everyone.
[00:04:48.912 --> 00:04:57.896]  Only 30% of the people in this country now are for these ridiculous wars that are all about profits and domestic diversions here in the United States.
[00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:01.237]  And then the big news we're going to be covering.
[00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.933]  I don't want to say we broke this news, because everything was there in plain view, but we really did.
[00:05:07.794 --> 00:05:10.275]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.net.
[00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:17.580]  Well, actually, my webmaster and writer, one of my writers for Infowars.net, Steve Watson, broke this, but it's gone supernova on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.162]  That's why we've surged past the Dallas Morning News over 1,000 place points.
[00:05:21.682 --> 00:05:22.923]  It's kind of getting scary when my...
[00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.950]  We're good to go.
[00:05:47.643 --> 00:05:48.224]  We're good to go.
[00:05:48.344 --> 00:05:48.624]  I think?
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:28.429]  We see Muhammad Atta and one of the other supposed 9-11 hijackers on this tape with no sound saying, well, they said the lip readers couldn't say what they were saying, but the government announced it and said it was total proof that they had carried out 9-11.
[00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.090]  Well, there was a problem.
[00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:37.314]  This is how stupid the government, that is the criminal elements, not our whole government, criminal elements of our government think we are.
[00:06:38.012 --> 00:06:40.255]  This was in a docudrama for U.S.
[00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.877]  television a year ago.
[00:06:41.897 --> 00:06:43.479]  It aired in the U.S.
[00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.062]  about 13 months ago and England about 11 months ago.
[00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:48.986]  And it's called The Road to Guantanamo.
[00:06:49.246 --> 00:06:51.309]  You've seen it on PBS and all over the place.
[00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.493]  And this is footage released...
[00:06:55.246 --> 00:06:56.767]  By an unnamed government source.
[00:06:57.527 --> 00:06:59.088]  It goes back four years ago.
[00:06:59.348 --> 00:07:11.633]  The media has never aired it, and now it's coming out that, yes, it is some type of fake, and they admit that it was computer-enhanced on the TV show, and they added hijackers' faces via CGI.
[00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:17.676]  Do you realize what you're hearing right now nationwide, ladies and gentlemen, from the studios of NewsRadio 590, KLBJ?
[00:07:17.836 --> 00:07:20.117]  Do you realize what I just said?
[00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:21.978]  It is admitted.
[00:07:22.678 --> 00:07:40.142]  That there was a documentary that aired worldwide titled The Road to Guantanamo where they took previous CIA surveillance footage, then they CGI'd in different, quote, hijackers into the footage and used it on television.
[00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:44.858]  And now the government a year later thinks we're so dumb.
[00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:47.139]  First they announced Al-Qaeda released the tape.
[00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:49.220]  Now it's been admitted that our government leaked the tape.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.900]  Lie number one.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.420]  We already knew that day one.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.941]  Every time they're in trouble politically, new Al-Qaeda tapes are released.
[00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:55.522]  We already proved four years ago.
[00:07:55.562 --> 00:07:56.702]  Remember the fat bin Laden?
[00:07:56.882 --> 00:07:57.902]  His nose had grown an inch.
[00:07:58.042 --> 00:07:59.063]  He gained 100 pounds.
[00:07:59.243 --> 00:08:01.364]  They did voice print in Canada and the U.S.
[00:08:01.444 --> 00:08:02.504]  universities in France.
[00:08:02.944 --> 00:08:03.545]  We're good to go.
[00:08:19.537 --> 00:08:21.278]  We're good to go.
[00:08:44.312 --> 00:08:46.297]  But this is exciting.
[00:08:46.838 --> 00:08:49.525]  And not to mention everybody that copies our stories all over the web.
[00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:52.292]  So again, it feels good to be exposing these liars.
[00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:56.490]  A lot of the mainstream pundits will ignore this, but it doesn't matter.
[00:08:56.531 --> 00:08:59.833]  It's a huge international incident right now.
[00:09:00.453 --> 00:09:17.144]  All over the world, people are going and watching the video clip that we have, every claim we make we show, right off of the documentary, The Road to Guantanamo, and everyone's saying that this new video was a release by our government, and they lied and said Al Qaeda did it.
[00:09:17.444 --> 00:09:19.144]  And B, it's CGI fake.
[00:09:19.385 --> 00:09:25.706]  It's like The Running Man, where they show Mad Dog Ben Richards really attacking the people with a helicopter, but he didn't do it.
[00:09:26.086 --> 00:09:28.627]  You understand they can show Forrest Gump shaking hands with Kennedy.
[00:09:28.787 --> 00:09:31.847]  They can show Steve McQueen 20-something years after he's dead.
[00:09:31.867 --> 00:09:32.768]  He died in 81.
[00:09:33.048 --> 00:09:35.348]  Last year, pitching the new Mustang, which, by the way, I like.
[00:09:35.388 --> 00:09:37.509]  I'm not knocking the new retro Mustang.
[00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:39.209]  I'm just telling you, he's dead, folks.
[00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:40.689]  It wasn't really Steve McQueen.
[00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.730]  All right, when we get back.
[00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.350]  I'm going to mention some of the other big stories we've got.
[00:09:45.491 --> 00:09:46.271]  Then we'll take calls.
[00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.091]  Then we'll go through all these articles.
[00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:51.412]  In fact, there's a lot of stuff on the Foley scandal you won't hear anywhere else.
[00:09:51.752 --> 00:09:52.152]  Stay with us.
[00:09:52.172 --> 00:09:52.772]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:59.214 --> 00:10:01.555]  Hi, this is Mark.
[00:10:03.946 --> 00:10:07.108]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:10:07.448 --> 00:10:09.389]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:17.413]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:18.093 --> 00:10:25.136]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.557 --> 00:10:28.478]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:31.199]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.480]  NSA spies.
[00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.341]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:36.282]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:11:00.307 --> 00:11:02.129]  Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.051]  Today is October 6, 2006.
[00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.534]  Gold opened at $586.80, and one-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $599.25.
[00:11:05.574 --> 00:11:07.677]  Again, that's $599.25 to purchase one-ounce gold coins.
[00:11:14.238 --> 00:11:16.939]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:21.960]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.761]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[00:11:24.221 --> 00:11:27.362]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:33.203]  We, the people, labor to create the money, only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[00:11:33.603 --> 00:11:39.245]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:44.568]  Midas Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.
[00:11:44.968 --> 00:11:45.268]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:12:31.187 --> 00:12:34.049]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[00:12:34.109 --> 00:12:35.669]  A tornado under your hood.
[00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:41.652]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[00:12:41.973 --> 00:12:49.116]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with tornado.
[00:12:49.256 --> 00:12:54.099]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:59.462]  Visit tornadoair.com or go to Pep Boys, Napa, or AutoZone today.

[00:14:12.168 --> 00:14:13.429]  Agree or disagree?
[00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:18.531]  Alex wants to hear from you right now at 877-590-5525.
[00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:21.652]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[00:14:29.715 --> 00:14:30.695]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:14:30.755 --> 00:14:35.137]  I'm glad that you've decided to join us on this October 8, 2006 transmission against tyranny.
[00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.633]  Your calls are coming up later.
[00:14:40.653 --> 00:14:45.698]  In fact, in this segment, the toll-free number across the country is 877-590-5525.
[00:14:45.878 --> 00:14:52.084]  Is that George Bush in the background doing a Bohemian Grove or Skull and Bones chant?
[00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.132]  All right.
[00:14:56.272 --> 00:14:59.734]  I tell you, they've got some weird music around here.
[00:14:59.754 --> 00:15:06.899]  877-590-5525 or locally all over Central Texas, 836-0590 or pound 590 for singular wireless.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.081]  Folks, let me get serious because this is serious.
[00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.919]  This happened again yesterday.
[00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:13.359]  It's escalating today.
[00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:16.920]  Shots fired across tense Korean border.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:26.102]  AP reports a midday incursion Saturday by North Korean troops into the southern side of the no-man's land separating North and South Korea only stoked the unease.
[00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:35.945]  South Korea soldiers rattled off 40 warning shots at the five communist troops who crossed the center line of the demilitarized zone, the inter-Korean buffer, or DMZ.
[00:15:37.094 --> 00:15:40.999]  It was unclear whether the North Korean advance was intended as a provocation.
[00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:42.501]  Oh, gee, I wonder.
[00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:48.688]  They've just been caught digging huge tunnels under it, constantly seizing, constantly shooting at South Korean tribes.
[00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:51.430]  I mean, this is a real problem, okay?
[00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:59.234]  But the media will not demonize North Korea because the establishment in this country does not want to go to war with them because they've got over 20 weapons.
[00:15:59.254 --> 00:16:00.935]  They had 20 weapons four or five years ago.
[00:16:01.235 --> 00:16:03.056]  And who helped give them the reactors in 1996?
[00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:07.418]  The head of ABB, the Swiss company, and guess who that was?
[00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:08.859]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:11.540]  Bill Clinton was evil for allowing the transfer.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:12.860]  Of the reactors.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.181]  And the conservatives all got mad at him.
[00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:18.322]  But I went and did more research and found out who was behind it.
[00:16:18.402 --> 00:16:22.644]  Clinton just always signed off on what the neocons wanted to happen.
[00:16:22.664 --> 00:16:24.324]  That's why they're even worse.
[00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:26.165]  But I understand.
[00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:28.926]  Reactors are good if it's a conservative giving it to North Korea.
[00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:30.366]  It's only bad if it's Bill Clinton.
[00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:36.168]  Just like I was saying it was bad when Democrats were... Barney Frank was running the underage...
[00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:37.304]  We're good to go.
[00:16:57.877 --> 00:17:02.158]  Basically most of them are paid off or compromised or they wouldn't be to that level of power.
[00:17:02.518 --> 00:17:06.860]  The establishment picks people now for positions of power who are compromised.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.360]  And we're going to get into that later.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.581]  I'm kind of jumping back and forth.
[00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:12.601]  But it's all interconnected.
[00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:21.144]  We have a decadent Congress, a decadent executive, a decadent government in the judicial as well.
[00:17:21.344 --> 00:17:25.525]  And things are not going in a good direction.
[00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:44.725]  Japan and China tell North Korea that a test is unacceptable, and Japan is saying they may scrap their constitution that MacArthur got rammed through when he was, of course, the governor general of Japan, where they're not allowed to have an offensive military.
[00:17:45.046 --> 00:17:49.589]  And Japan's saying, hey, we take the preemptive strike policy of Bush, we're going to develop nukes.
[00:17:49.649 --> 00:17:54.733]  And again, that's back of the newspaper that Japan, and my sources tell me, have already been developing in.
[00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:55.317]  Thank you.
[00:18:13.604 --> 00:18:14.804]  Ridiculous amount.
[00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:17.185]  Clearly not just for nuclear power.
[00:18:17.365 --> 00:18:19.306]  Though they're big into nuclear power there.
[00:18:19.626 --> 00:18:20.506]  That is certainly true.
[00:18:20.526 --> 00:18:29.269]  So it's a massive escalation, a massive arms race, a huge escalation of tensions in the entire region, in the entire area.
[00:18:29.689 --> 00:18:31.430]  And it's extremely serious.
[00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.931]  You're welcome to call in on that subject as well.
[00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:42.185]  Also, later in the broadcast, I'm going to go to calls right now, and then we'll go to break and come back and get into the fake video.
[00:18:42.245 --> 00:18:48.289]  They released fake video last Friday, not this Friday, but last Friday, nine days ago, remember?
[00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.133]  Fake video of Muhammad Adda and one of his cohorts.
[00:18:53.453 --> 00:18:57.636]  That is not real, and we're going to tell you why and how it's been admitted.
[00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:00.268]  Again, they just release these fake videos.
[00:19:00.308 --> 00:19:01.970]  It's a big national headline for two or three days.
[00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.593]  And then always it gets retracted a week, a month, six months later.
[00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:07.774]  And I want to go over some past cases of this.
[00:19:07.914 --> 00:19:10.496]  Again, this is huge hoax in front of you.
[00:19:10.697 --> 00:19:12.818]  You're being lied to, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:13.699 --> 00:19:15.080]  You realize the magnitude of that.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.622]  Sometimes something this big kind of escapes people.
[00:19:19.012 --> 00:19:19.532]  We're good to go.
[00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:19.933]  We're good to go.
[00:19:42.032 --> 00:19:44.094]  All he walked by and said, the war is reprehensible.
[00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:45.255]  Seize that man!
[00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:50.259]  And now the press has gone back and found dozens and dozens and dozens of cases of this.
[00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:53.871]  Where you get arrested if you just say anything to the Lord.
[00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:58.153]  And I heard neocons during the week when this story was big saying, That's good!
[00:19:58.213 --> 00:19:59.773]  How dare you be disrespectful!
[00:20:00.054 --> 00:20:05.356]  How dare you talk bad to Lord Cheney or Lord Bush!
[00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:06.917]  Again, you need to leave America, folks.
[00:20:06.937 --> 00:20:07.977]  You're not conservatives.
[00:20:08.338 --> 00:20:09.618]  You don't care about this country.
[00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.739]  You are cancer to this country.
[00:20:11.799 --> 00:20:17.502]  Even if you don't agree with some person who's anti-war walking in Colorado through...
[00:20:17.962 --> 00:20:25.256]  An outdoor mall and being five feet from Cheney and saying, and this is admitted, your war is reprehensible, or no, this war is reprehensible.
[00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:28.142]  The Secret Service arrested him.
[00:20:28.968 --> 00:20:32.150]  Took him in and told the police there at the county, the sheriff's department.
[00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.231]  They said, he said, this war is reprehensible.
[00:20:34.472 --> 00:20:35.232]  That is assault.
[00:20:35.292 --> 00:20:35.892]  Charge him.
[00:20:36.493 --> 00:20:39.455]  And later the county dropped the charges and the Secret Service is very upset.
[00:20:39.495 --> 00:20:39.715]  No, no.
[00:20:39.915 --> 00:20:42.417]  You must be charged for talking to God.
[00:20:42.677 --> 00:20:43.157]  What do you think?
[00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:45.779]  This is America where you can talk to a God?
[00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:46.559]  A God?
[00:20:46.639 --> 00:20:47.059]  What do you think?
[00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.040]  You're living in the U.S.?
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.001]  No, man.
[00:20:49.041 --> 00:20:49.901]  We're living in Russia.
[00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:50.742]  Oh, wait.
[00:20:50.762 --> 00:20:51.642]  We are living in America.
[00:20:52.243 --> 00:20:54.264]  So do I have time to go to calls before break?
[00:20:54.604 --> 00:20:55.065]  I don't do.
[00:20:55.265 --> 00:20:55.665]  You know what?
[00:20:56.593 --> 00:21:01.098]  We're going to continue ranting, and then as soon as I come back, I'll go to Troy in Duluth, Minnesota.
[00:21:01.118 --> 00:21:02.099]  Man, that is a beautiful town.
[00:21:02.619 --> 00:21:10.628]  When you go up over the hill and there's that big lake, and you're up there, it's all... I want to go fishing up there with some more walleye and... What's the big ones that look like gar, but they're not?
[00:21:11.429 --> 00:21:11.909]  I forget.
[00:21:11.949 --> 00:21:13.230]  I caught a bunch of them up there.
[00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:15.393]  And then there's... I'm talking to folks through the glass window.
[00:21:15.413 --> 00:21:16.234]  Talk shows do that.
[00:21:16.254 --> 00:21:19.277]  You think we're talking to ourselves, we're talking to the in-studio audience.
[00:21:19.693 --> 00:21:20.494]  Three people in there.
[00:21:20.514 --> 00:21:21.435]  That's a huge audience.
[00:21:22.756 --> 00:21:25.719]  All right, and then Jeff in Denver, Colorado.
[00:21:25.779 --> 00:21:28.962]  We'll talk to some locals, too, at 836-0590.
[00:21:29.222 --> 00:21:31.064]  If you just joined us, we tested it last week.
[00:21:31.084 --> 00:21:31.605]  It did great.
[00:21:32.025 --> 00:21:34.007]  This week, this is officially syndicated.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:38.031]  Star Guide ABC up on the big fancy bird.
[00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:40.860]  And I am really excited about this.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.701]  And we've got a lot of stations that I'm told this week are already signed on.
[00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:45.601]  I think they're tuned in today, picking us up.
[00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:52.504]  But if not, they'll be tuned in next week, which is the first official broadcast of the new syndicated Sunday show.
[00:21:52.804 --> 00:21:54.144]  Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:21:54.224 --> 00:21:56.805]  from the beautiful and historic studios.
[00:21:57.265 --> 00:21:57.746]  We're good to go.
[00:22:19.332 --> 00:22:19.933]  Up and on the air.
[00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:24.680]  So let me just set the table again for you of what we're going to be covering later in the broadcast.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.046]  I have some new interesting, I wouldn't call them tidbits because it's disgusting.
[00:22:29.487 --> 00:22:35.235]  Tidbit kind of notes something delicious and tasty, like maybe some beer nuts or something.
[00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:39.496]  More of the pervert activities of the Republicans and Democrats.
[00:22:39.856 --> 00:22:41.017]  Oh yes, both sides are involved.
[00:22:41.317 --> 00:22:43.818]  This is really one side, the establishment criminals.
[00:22:44.378 --> 00:22:47.659]  And we'll get into the fake hijacker videos they've been releasing.
[00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:52.041]  We'll get into how Google's going to use the microphones and cameras in your computer to watch and listen to you.
[00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:56.402]  And a lot more on the other side, so stay with us.
[00:23:02.242 --> 00:23:04.825]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[00:26:05.963 --> 00:26:08.986]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[00:26:09.246 --> 00:26:12.710]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:18.816]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest, greatest nutritional wonder products?
[00:26:19.156 --> 00:26:23.937]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.

[00:27:32.423 --> 00:27:33.484]  First week syndicating the show.
[00:27:33.504 --> 00:27:34.005]  We're excited.
[00:27:34.485 --> 00:27:38.290]  Okay, so the big news really is that North Korea has sent troops across the DMZ.
[00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:40.493]  They got shot at by the South Koreans and backed off.
[00:27:40.813 --> 00:27:44.438]  All of this while North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il threatens to test.
[00:27:44.918 --> 00:27:45.859]  We're good to go.
[00:28:05.856 --> 00:28:07.037]  Toy gun to school.
[00:28:07.097 --> 00:28:08.539]  He's been charged with terrorism.
[00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:09.319]  That's right.
[00:28:09.339 --> 00:28:11.762]  Under Patriot Act, all misdemeanors are terrorism.
[00:28:11.782 --> 00:28:12.482]  You have no rights.
[00:28:12.943 --> 00:28:14.344]  Go read Section 802 for yourself.
[00:28:15.045 --> 00:28:17.247]  Also, I'm not kidding when I say this.
[00:28:17.287 --> 00:28:18.088]  This is serious.
[00:28:18.168 --> 00:28:19.149]  I don't do potty humor.
[00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:21.811]  This is BBC headline and a NOVA headline.
[00:28:22.031 --> 00:28:23.433]  This was in major British news.
[00:28:23.893 --> 00:28:25.915]  Police hunting, farting dissident.
[00:28:26.827 --> 00:28:27.167]  Okay.
[00:28:27.788 --> 00:28:30.249]  He was disrespectful of a dear leader in Poland.
[00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.852]  There was a national manhunt for the man that was disrespectful of the president.
[00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.853]  We'll tell you about that a little bit later.
[00:28:36.133 --> 00:28:39.476]  Really serious report here that was in the Israeli and U.S.
[00:28:39.516 --> 00:28:43.799]  battle plans going back to 83, even when Saddam was our big ally.
[00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:47.681]  Our government swore to later invade the country and break it in three parts.
[00:28:48.302 --> 00:28:51.444]  Since 2002, I've been telling you, when I learned of the plans and read them,
[00:28:51.684 --> 00:28:52.084]  We're good to go.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.620]  We're good to go.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.681]  We're good to go.
[00:29:30.052 --> 00:29:30.292]  Thank you.
[00:29:30.312 --> 00:29:30.592]  Thank you.
[00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:49.773]  We will then, of course, get back into the really huge story that we broke at PrisonPlanet.com with the great work of Steve Watson.
[00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:52.214]  Thanks to tips from listeners in plain view.
[00:29:52.915 --> 00:29:56.957]  Hidden in plain view, it is admitted that the hijacker video that you saw is a fraud.
[00:29:56.977 --> 00:30:01.138]  Remember two weeks ago, the two hijackers, Muhammad Atta and his deputy, laughing and taking credit?
[00:30:01.418 --> 00:30:05.580]  Turns out that is a fake, and the media isn't going to be retracting it anytime soon.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.141]  We'll tell you exactly how it's fake.
[00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:11.423]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Troy in Duluth, Minnesota.
[00:30:12.284 --> 00:30:16.068]  It's good to have you on board with us, Troy, here on our maiden voyage.
[00:30:16.328 --> 00:30:16.889]  Welcome, sir.
[00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:18.090]  Hey, Alex.
[00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:18.551]  Yes, sir.
[00:30:18.591 --> 00:30:18.891]  Go ahead.
[00:30:18.972 --> 00:30:19.833]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[00:30:19.913 --> 00:30:20.073]  Good.
[00:30:22.101 --> 00:30:31.065]  I've been following you for quite a while now, and I came across a bulletin today on MySpace that you were live right now on the radio station on air in Texas.
[00:30:31.105 --> 00:30:32.665]  I figured I'd just go ahead and call in.
[00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:33.045]  Well, good.
[00:30:33.066 --> 00:30:33.746]  Good to have you on board.
[00:30:33.766 --> 00:30:34.466]  What's on your mind, sir?
[00:30:34.806 --> 00:30:41.349]  The main reason why I'm calling in is because, just like any other American, I'm concerned about where this country is headed.
[00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:43.990]  We've got over 800 prison camps in the United States.
[00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.531]  They've got FEMA there that are going to take over once martial law is declared.
[00:30:48.228 --> 00:30:56.958]  Now there's all this talk, I mean, there's enough distractions to be able to get the Americans to not see exactly what Congress is doing, what the government's doing to us, whatever.
[00:30:56.978 --> 00:31:08.572]  The stuff with North Korea, they're talking about that there's going to be some testing going on, and the president and the government is making some pretty stiff decisions,
[00:31:10.021 --> 00:31:11.662]  What's the term I'm looking for?
[00:31:11.683 --> 00:31:14.164]  Some pretty stiff demands.
[00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:17.427]  If you're going to be doing this testing, there's going to be some kind of consequences.
[00:31:17.487 --> 00:31:18.828]  Now, there's talk about drafts.
[00:31:18.868 --> 00:31:19.729]  There's talk about this.
[00:31:19.769 --> 00:31:20.609]  There's talk about that.
[00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.752]  What is your take as far as if something really goes down in North Korea?
[00:31:25.573 --> 00:31:27.815]  Well, let me give you my take on that, as you put it.
[00:31:27.935 --> 00:31:29.536]  And everything you said is important.
[00:31:31.878 --> 00:31:33.659]  The reason I brought up North Korea is this.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.563]  We're being told that the Iranians are literally Satan's children.
[00:31:39.113 --> 00:31:42.214]  We're being told that they're going to kill all of us any minute if we don't invade them.
[00:31:42.435 --> 00:31:46.857]  We're being told they've got nuclear weapons, A-bombs, missiles to hit us.
[00:31:46.937 --> 00:31:47.777]  It's all lies.
[00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:52.359]  We've been told the same stuff, like they throw babies out of incubators like Saddam did.
[00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:55.080]  That was a New York PR firm that's admitted fraud.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.641]  Same thing, they claim they make Jews wear yellow stars.
[00:31:57.921 --> 00:32:00.623]  Turned out that was totally made up out of the bowels of our own government.
[00:32:00.923 --> 00:32:01.883]  A total psyop.
[00:32:02.844 --> 00:32:03.144]  Okay?
[00:32:03.564 --> 00:32:05.505]  My whole point is the Iranians aren't perfect.
[00:32:05.985 --> 00:32:10.588]  But they are no threat to this country when you compare them to places like North Korea or China.
[00:32:10.608 --> 00:32:13.309]  Just type in, Chinese military threatens to nuke U.S.
[00:32:13.329 --> 00:32:13.889]  Just type it in.
[00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:15.610]  You'll get hundreds of articles over the years.
[00:32:15.991 --> 00:32:26.596]  Just a few months ago, their top general called a press conference, the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine was there, Forbes was there, AP was there, Reuters was there, and they said, we're your 214 cities targeted.
[00:32:26.897 --> 00:32:33.060]  We will kill over half your population if you get involved in Taiwan and we take it in the next two years.
[00:32:33.638 --> 00:32:45.729]  I mean, they had press conferences saying, we're targeting you, we're going to attack you if you get involved, not just in Taiwan, they said in any of our interests, including the Panama Canal, which our government just gave to them.
[00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:51.795]  And don't blame it on Jimmy Carter, he was part of it, but in 2000 the Republican Congress let it go through.
[00:32:52.075 --> 00:32:54.938]  We're being totally encircled, totally and completely sold out.
[00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:58.722]  So I don't want to hear about Iran by all these phony, gutless...
[00:32:59.222 --> 00:33:02.144]  Chicken hawk fake conservatives that call into these talk shows.
[00:33:02.665 --> 00:33:04.106]  You're the people killing my country.
[00:33:04.406 --> 00:33:06.107]  The New World Order loves North Korea.
[00:33:06.147 --> 00:33:06.788]  They love China.
[00:33:06.808 --> 00:33:10.170]  They love all these places where people are slaves and they sell political dissonance organs.
[00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:10.991]  People have no rights.
[00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:12.792]  They hate the United States.
[00:33:13.152 --> 00:33:17.195]  And they're bringing this country down every way they can with open borders, with NAFTA, with GATT.
[00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:17.735]  We're good to go.
[00:33:33.487 --> 00:33:34.969]  You know, what's going to happen with North Korea?
[00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.829]  I don't know.
[00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:37.591]  The guy's a complete psychopath.
[00:33:37.631 --> 00:33:41.295]  He's like a four-foot-nine Napoleon complex spoiled brat.
[00:33:41.575 --> 00:33:43.617]  His father gave him power when he died.
[00:33:43.637 --> 00:33:52.906]  I mean, the guy literally hijacks aircraft, has his troops hijack aircraft because he wants Asian film stars, and then when he gets mad at them...
[00:33:53.126 --> 00:33:53.907]  He kills them.
[00:33:53.947 --> 00:34:09.098]  I mean, he kidnaps, he grabs, and think of a Hollywood movie where there's an evil dictator in some third world country living in some mountain armored base, and he has troops hijacking jets and kidnapping women, and then he takes them back and rapes them and kills them.
[00:34:09.945 --> 00:34:15.789]  Okay, I mean, this is like Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy running a country with nuclear weapons, okay?
[00:34:16.209 --> 00:34:19.011]  He's just as bad as the New World Order that runs our country.
[00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:21.473]  Again, North Korean people are good people.
[00:34:21.673 --> 00:34:22.693]  People of America are good people.
[00:34:22.713 --> 00:34:23.814]  People of Iran are good people.
[00:34:24.194 --> 00:34:26.296]  Governments throughout history are corrupt and wicked.
[00:34:26.576 --> 00:34:28.817]  A very wicked group's gotten control of our government.
[00:34:28.857 --> 00:34:31.159]  And a very wicked group's gotten control of North Korea.
[00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:34.341]  And I'm here to tell you folks that it's serious.
[00:34:34.521 --> 00:34:35.762]  I don't know what's going to happen with it.
[00:34:36.042 --> 00:34:37.563]  But it's escalating the entire region.
[00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:38.484]  Let's take another call.
[00:34:39.264 --> 00:34:42.346]  Let's talk to Jeff in Denver, Colorado.
[00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:43.006]  Jeff, welcome.
[00:34:44.727 --> 00:34:45.868]  Yes, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:45.888 --> 00:34:46.148]  Go ahead.
[00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:47.829]  Hey, it's great to talk to you, Alex.
[00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:48.270]  Welcome.
[00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.491]  Great show, great films, great info, great job.
[00:34:52.112 --> 00:34:52.632]  Thank you, sir.
[00:34:53.553 --> 00:34:54.213]  I appreciate you.
[00:34:54.273 --> 00:34:54.634]  Go ahead.
[00:34:55.414 --> 00:34:58.176]  Listen, I just wanted to kind of ask you your thoughts on something.
[00:34:58.196 --> 00:34:59.637]  Something that was brought to my attention.
[00:34:59.657 --> 00:35:01.218]  I haven't heard it anywhere, read it anywhere.
[00:35:01.238 --> 00:35:04.980]  Can't think of any better place to kind of check the validity of this, but
[00:35:05.463 --> 00:35:08.659]  Something that I heard regarding Marvin Bush, brother of George Bush.
[00:35:09.693 --> 00:35:13.396]  Being a director of a security company that's a Kuwaiti-American-owned security company.
[00:35:13.456 --> 00:35:16.078]  Yes, that ran security on the World Trade Centers.
[00:35:16.438 --> 00:35:16.739]  Exactly.
[00:35:16.859 --> 00:35:20.802]  And the last day of their three-year contract was September 11, 2001.
[00:35:21.622 --> 00:35:23.984]  That was the final day.
[00:35:24.024 --> 00:35:25.606]  Their contract actually ended the day before.
[00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:28.048]  And he was in the subway system when it collapsed.
[00:35:28.088 --> 00:35:31.210]  We learned this from his mother, who wrote the biography, Reflections.
[00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.994]  Then two East Coast papers picked up and did report that they were running security on the towers.
[00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:48.674]  And, of course, Jeb Bush declared martial law, that's the AP headline, on September 9th, what, three days before the first time in Florida history he declared martial law three days before.
[00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:52.251]  Yep, so it sounds pretty valid.
[00:35:52.371 --> 00:35:54.253]  That's because Flight 93 was going to the Capitol.
[00:35:54.473 --> 00:35:57.235]  It was going to decapitate the legislative branch.
[00:35:57.255 --> 00:36:08.885]  We were going to have official martial law then, but the happy hooligans out of North Dakota, based in Virginia, were drilled, refused to follow orders, and fired two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles into the aircraft.
[00:36:09.926 --> 00:36:13.909]  Then they stopped the Central Intelligence Agency attempted decapitation of the United States government.
[00:36:14.289 --> 00:36:15.210]  Well, bless those folks.
[00:36:15.786 --> 00:36:16.307]  Absolutely.
[00:36:16.327 --> 00:36:16.767]  Isn't that great?
[00:36:16.787 --> 00:36:18.128]  The fake let's roll story.
[00:36:18.168 --> 00:36:19.409]  Tell the state police to shut up.
[00:36:19.629 --> 00:36:21.291]  You didn't see missiles blow that plane up.
[00:36:21.551 --> 00:36:25.494]  Oh, planes normally have an eight and a half mile debris field and an engine eight and a half miles.
[00:36:25.634 --> 00:36:26.615]  I was just going to say that.
[00:36:26.635 --> 00:36:28.657]  Wasn't there debris that was for miles upon miles?
[00:36:28.677 --> 00:36:34.422]  Yeah, the biggest crash site of a large plane was less than a mile long, okay?
[00:36:34.742 --> 00:36:36.844]  I mean, they've had planes crash many times.
[00:36:36.864 --> 00:36:38.024]  There have been a few.
[00:36:38.525 --> 00:36:39.686]  Now, that's a normal crash.
[00:36:39.946 --> 00:36:40.787]  They've had some.
[00:36:44.489 --> 00:36:48.392]  Thanks for the call.
[00:36:48.552 --> 00:36:50.153]  We'll come right back and take more calls.
[00:36:50.173 --> 00:36:51.474]  We'll get into the fake video.
[00:36:51.714 --> 00:36:56.057]  Our government, criminal elements of our government, have released a fake hijacker video.
[00:36:56.437 --> 00:36:58.298]  Confession video of a week and a half ago.
[00:36:58.618 --> 00:37:01.159]  Stay with us as we transmit from the studios of NewsRadio.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.801]  ...use Cardivite, know about the pollutants in our body, and want the milk.
[00:37:05.021 --> 00:37:08.423]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:37:08.603 --> 00:37:12.025]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:37:12.324 --> 00:37:15.587]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:37:15.607 --> 00:37:21.092]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:37:21.112 --> 00:37:26.397]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:30.761]  Now, going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:32.182]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:37:32.202 --> 00:37:37.647]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:37:38.147 --> 00:37:42.589]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:37:42.669 --> 00:37:44.050]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:48.012]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:05.819]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:40:05.879 --> 00:40:06.600]  have diabetes.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:13.882]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:40:14.022 --> 00:40:18.543]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:40:18.763 --> 00:40:21.564]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:41:40.919 --> 00:41:46.544]  Okay, let me just try to hit a few of these stories and get some of the details out of the way of some stories I've mentioned.
[00:41:46.844 --> 00:41:48.326]  Then we'll go right back to your calls.
[00:41:48.346 --> 00:41:49.547]  I'd like to get your take on these.
[00:41:50.873 --> 00:41:57.315]  We know that there are criminal elements of our government that really work for global corporations that use the U.S.
[00:41:57.375 --> 00:42:00.196]  as its muscle to go around dominating the planet.
[00:42:00.576 --> 00:42:04.938]  And the American people pay for this, but it's not the American people that are, quote, you know, getting anything out of this.
[00:42:04.958 --> 00:42:07.158]  There's so many good old boys who mean well.
[00:42:07.179 --> 00:42:08.519]  You know, they're not bad individuals.
[00:42:08.639 --> 00:42:10.760]  Think that we're over there getting some oil.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.880]  I mean, I've heard them on talk radio.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.060]  All right, so what?
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:13.881]  We're getting our oil.
[00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:14.641]  We need it.
[00:42:15.143 --> 00:42:24.034]  The oil company's own memos, and this has been in the AP, Associated Press, report that they want to go into Iraq and shut off the oil to then jack up the prices.
[00:42:24.334 --> 00:42:25.395]  There's too much oil.
[00:42:25.796 --> 00:42:30.602]  Oil company documents came out in 2001 that they were going to buy up all the refineries in the U.S.,
[00:42:31.082 --> 00:42:34.885]  The private Leon ones and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:42:35.145 --> 00:42:38.187]  And it's about $100 plus billion in weapons sales every year.
[00:42:38.227 --> 00:42:42.209]  It's about $100 plus billion in no-bid contracts to service the troops.
[00:42:42.509 --> 00:42:44.331]  It's about big business.
[00:42:44.411 --> 00:42:50.855]  And again, the Ram Corporation, the government's own think tanks, the private corporations, they all brag about this.
[00:42:51.395 --> 00:42:51.875]  We're good to go.
[00:42:51.915 --> 00:42:52.356]  We're good to go.
[00:43:08.141 --> 00:43:10.882]  On the fake video, and how is it fake?
[00:43:12.142 --> 00:43:24.385]  Last Friday, not this Friday, but last Friday, they announced, oh, here's Muhammad Atta and the number two hijacker, number one, number two, and this is them in 2000 in a cave somewhere, and here's some shots of bin Laden, and they suddenly cut the close shots of them, and this has never before been seen.
[00:43:24.445 --> 00:43:29.126]  Al-Qaeda just released this to program sleeper cells to start blowing America up.
[00:43:29.266 --> 00:43:29.986]  They're going to hit us.
[00:43:30.026 --> 00:43:30.826]  It's all over.
[00:43:31.146 --> 00:43:32.486]  You better vote for Republicans.
[00:43:32.546 --> 00:43:33.306]  I mean, you've heard it.
[00:43:33.326 --> 00:43:33.887]  You've seen it on TV.
[00:43:33.907 --> 00:43:34.787]  You've heard it on the radio.
[00:43:35.007 --> 00:43:35.907]  You know they said that.
[00:43:36.716 --> 00:43:42.319]  And then it came out earlier in the week that the Times of London who released it said, well, it actually didn't come from Al-Qaeda.
[00:43:42.339 --> 00:43:43.179]  It's a government source.
[00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:46.821]  And then we had listeners' emails that go, you know, I've seen this video.
[00:43:47.141 --> 00:43:50.503]  This very video was on a documentary there in the U.S.
[00:43:50.543 --> 00:43:53.244]  and England called The Road to Guantanamo.
[00:43:54.211 --> 00:43:55.933]  I've even seen parts of it on television.
[00:43:56.534 --> 00:44:12.812]  And lo and behold, you went online, there was the video, we went and watched it, there was the exact same video in a docudrama, and they said that the government had created this video and spliced in a different supposed terrorist with footage they'd shot at bin Laden training camps.
[00:44:13.385 --> 00:44:14.606]  Our government, how they have footage of this.
[00:44:14.926 --> 00:44:20.531]  And then they show it to terrorize and trick people into incriminating themselves at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:21.532]  So it's CGI.
[00:44:21.732 --> 00:44:31.840]  It's spliced, fake, mixed video with real footage being shown to us, and the government lied and said it was new, and this was Al Qaeda triggering sleeping cells.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.002]  Now that's yelling fire in a theater.
[00:44:34.422 --> 00:44:36.524]  That is terrorizing people.
[00:44:37.535 --> 00:44:38.256]  You understand that.
[00:44:38.836 --> 00:44:43.219]  We've written five reports on this at InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:44:43.239 --> 00:44:44.841]  Two of the reports at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:44:45.201 --> 00:44:47.683]  Two of them were detailed, long, like ten-page reports.
[00:44:48.483 --> 00:44:49.404]  Well, four and ten.
[00:44:49.424 --> 00:44:53.127]  The two reports are quite lengthy, full of hyperlinks.
[00:44:53.187 --> 00:44:55.168]  Every claim we make is documented.
[00:44:56.189 --> 00:45:01.713]  And then we found out where a lot of these videos first get posted within minutes or even before it's released on the news...
[00:45:03.092 --> 00:45:19.018]  This company called Defense, it's called Intel Center, and it's connected into some other groups, and the head of it is the former deputy of Donald Rumsfeld, Jim Milnick, and he served 16 years in U.S.
[00:45:19.178 --> 00:45:27.081]  Army Defense Intelligence and worked in psychological operations overseas in Russia and the Middle East, and that's where the videos are coming from.
[00:45:28.702 --> 00:45:32.945]  I mean, this is getting really, really rich, my friends.
[00:45:33.086 --> 00:45:35.527]  And that's just a few lines from the four reports.
[00:45:36.088 --> 00:45:38.450]  The rabbit hole goes quite deep.
[00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:44.294]  Or you can just choose to think, well, having the White House buy $1.6 billion last year in fake news.
[00:45:44.635 --> 00:45:45.015]  Don't believe me?
[00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:46.156]  Just type into Google.
[00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.557]  $1.6 billion in fake news bought.
[00:45:47.577 --> 00:45:51.160]  You'll get AP Reuters, ABC News, Fox News, and Fox.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:57.947]  No, the Congress says it's illegal to buy fake reporters and have reporters on your payroll, but the White House says they're going to continue the practice because they're above the law.
[00:45:58.427 --> 00:46:12.121]  You see, in an age where they openly admit they're buying fake news, planting fake news, they have Army and Defense Intelligence and Pentagon PSYOPs, psychological warfare, engaging in psychological brainwashing.
[00:46:12.739 --> 00:46:14.400]  I don't call that a war effort, folks.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.042]  I call that brainwashing.
[00:46:16.282 --> 00:46:18.263]  It's illegal, and it should stop.
[00:46:18.524 --> 00:46:27.010]  And if you think having the military planning fake stories and paying off reporters in our country and writing fake letters to the editor is freedom, get out of my country!
[00:46:27.391 --> 00:46:27.831]  I'm sorry.
[00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:29.532]  Now, what do you think about this story?
[00:46:29.652 --> 00:46:31.754]  I want to come back in the next hour.
[00:46:31.774 --> 00:46:32.695]  We've still got a ways to break.
[00:46:33.015 --> 00:46:35.137]  And I want to hear your comments on this at 836-0590 or toll-free, 877-590-5525.
[00:46:40.387 --> 00:46:44.856]  I want your... In fact, we've got a liner that we'll have next week.
[00:46:44.876 --> 00:46:48.063]  It's not ready yet, where I say that if you disagree with us, you go to the head of the line.
[00:46:48.818 --> 00:46:53.400]  I want to hear people... Some guy called in last week and said Operation Northwood is the official U.S.
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:56.742]  government plan to stage 9-11-style attacks and blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:46:57.002 --> 00:46:58.342]  He called in and said that was a lie.
[00:46:58.683 --> 00:47:10.568]  I got an email a week ago that I forgot to cover on the show from two weeks ago where a listener heard me say that Google has announced they're going to use the microphones and video cameras on your computers without your permission to watch you.
[00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:13.239]  It's in their own press release.
[00:47:13.679 --> 00:47:16.120]  And I've got the article right here that we wrote about it.
[00:47:17.281 --> 00:47:18.802]  Look, I know this stuff sounds crazy.
[00:47:19.042 --> 00:47:20.343]  I know this stuff's off the chart.
[00:47:20.803 --> 00:47:22.764]  I'm not the one making all this happen.
[00:47:23.144 --> 00:47:28.007]  I'm just a reporter here reporting you the news and information, and I happen to be an angry reporter.
[00:47:28.267 --> 00:47:30.128]  I'm trying to get you moving to wake up.
[00:47:30.488 --> 00:47:33.210]  Okay?
[00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:35.071]  That's my goal, basically.
[00:47:35.931 --> 00:47:37.392]  That's what I'm attempting to do.
[00:47:38.253 --> 00:47:40.474]  Now, speak of the devil...
[00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.552]  Let me just go ahead and get into this report briefly.
[00:47:44.572 --> 00:47:45.333]  Then we'll take a call.
[00:47:45.353 --> 00:48:01.146]  We'll go to break, start the next hour, and get into the Foley, the new revelations with Mark Foley, the pervert by any stretch of the imagination, a middle-aged congressman trying to get into the boys' dorm.
[00:48:01.186 --> 00:48:02.427]  I mean, come on, folks.
[00:48:03.368 --> 00:48:08.973]  But we'll talk about how he's being defended by some people and how they're trying to spin it.
[00:48:09.807 --> 00:48:14.189]  And then we'll cover just the police state in this country, people being arrested.
[00:48:14.389 --> 00:48:28.534]  In fact, do you think that you should be arrested if the vice president's walking around in an outdoor mall in Colorado, you walk by with your eight-year-old son, and you say from five feet away, this is all admitted, this war is reprehensible, and you're arrested and charged with assaulting the vice president?
[00:48:28.915 --> 00:48:30.155]  Because that's what they've done coast to coast.
[00:48:30.455 --> 00:48:35.677]  Finally, the reporters out there for the Rocky Mountain News and other big papers went and found out this had happened to a bunch of people.
[00:48:35.737 --> 00:48:36.538]  We were aware of this.
[00:48:36.578 --> 00:48:37.278]  We were noticing it.
[00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:40.707]  But the mainstream news has never gotten all these cases together.
[00:48:41.227 --> 00:48:45.131]  Folks, if you have a bumper sticker on your car... Oh, that's another thing.
[00:48:45.271 --> 00:48:46.432]  They don't just buy fake news.
[00:48:46.732 --> 00:48:53.157]  They have fake town hall meetings where on television they say, Oh, Dick Cheney or President Bush is here for a town hall meeting.
[00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:54.698]  He's here in our town in Arizona.
[00:48:55.019 --> 00:48:58.101]  Or he's here in Norfolk, Virginia.
[00:48:58.161 --> 00:49:00.363]  Or he's here in Miami, Florida for a town hall meeting.
[00:49:01.673 --> 00:49:01.953]  I think so.
[00:49:16.232 --> 00:49:18.673]  They have little cameras hooked onto computers that just scan them.
[00:49:18.954 --> 00:49:21.395]  You can just walk by, and they scan the license plates.
[00:49:21.515 --> 00:49:23.796]  Just type in plate scanning software.
[00:49:23.876 --> 00:49:26.398]  It's been put in on most of the cameras on the street corners, but they have this.
[00:49:26.658 --> 00:49:34.963]  And then they go in and find out where you're at and arrest you if you've got a Democrat or no war sticker claiming it's a violation of what you swore to do.
[00:49:35.243 --> 00:49:39.025]  Meanwhile, people at home watching the town hall think everyone agrees with the president.
[00:49:39.245 --> 00:49:40.606]  Everyone agrees with the vice president.
[00:49:40.766 --> 00:49:42.447]  It's a public open town hall.
[00:49:42.607 --> 00:49:43.788]  I mean, is that America?
[00:49:44.108 --> 00:49:46.289]  Signing forms swearing you won't disagree?
[00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.071]  Signing forms that you agree?
[00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:51.833]  And then lying on television and saying it's a town hall?
[00:49:53.114 --> 00:49:54.454]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:49:54.495 --> 00:49:55.115]  But here's Google.
[00:49:56.256 --> 00:50:00.838]  Government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[00:50:00.878 --> 00:50:02.600]  And that's the headline Paul gave it.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:03.460]  I wrote part of the article.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.061]  It's an article by Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:50:05.441 --> 00:50:11.265]  Invasive surveillance and advertising obliterates even minority report style technology.
[00:50:12.404 --> 00:50:14.165]  And people are saying, well, this is prisonplanet.com.
[00:50:14.185 --> 00:50:14.965]  This is your report.
[00:50:15.825 --> 00:50:20.447]  Go to the article and click on it, and it's all hyperlinks.
[00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:28.391]  You can go to the report and click through to Google's own website, and they're bragging in a press release.
[00:50:28.411 --> 00:50:30.251]  That's how we learned of this, listener synthesis.
[00:50:30.551 --> 00:50:32.252]  And they said, oh, don't worry.
[00:50:32.912 --> 00:50:39.155]  The microphones that are now standard on most computers, and some have cameras, it will just listen to your television broadcast.
[00:50:39.255 --> 00:50:54.172]  To you and your wife, to your wife and your husband, to everything that's said, the radio, and we'll judge your taste with this algorithm, psychological profiling software, and then we'll sell that data to the government and private industries and take your name out of it.
[00:50:55.123 --> 00:50:56.644]  Well, how are they going to do that and sell the data?
[00:50:56.684 --> 00:51:02.907]  The point is, they didn't ask you, and they claim, well, the computer digitizes just the keywords and isn't really recording everything you say.
[00:51:03.228 --> 00:51:04.648]  It's just getting the keywords.
[00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:05.809]  It's the same thing.
[00:51:06.009 --> 00:51:07.670]  And this is out of the gates, they're telling us.
[00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:08.731]  They didn't ask us.
[00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:11.592]  They're just going to have a microphone running in your house.
[00:51:12.053 --> 00:51:14.274]  They're going to have the camera running in your house.
[00:51:15.435 --> 00:51:18.436]  I want to get your take on this when we start the next hour as well.
[00:51:18.736 --> 00:51:23.159]  So, Rick in Belton, Texas, when we get back in the second hour, we'll go straight to you and others.
[00:51:24.634 --> 00:51:32.196]  And again, we've got the government issuing Al-Qaeda videos and then saying Al-Qaeda released them, being caught in that being a lie.
[00:51:32.516 --> 00:51:35.756]  Now it's admittedly fake from some docudrama TV show.
[00:51:36.237 --> 00:51:38.117]  We've got cameras watching everybody.
[00:51:38.537 --> 00:51:42.818]  We've got all these microphones, people being arrested for questioning the vice president.
[00:51:43.138 --> 00:51:46.319]  I want to hear what you think about America turning into a police state when we get back.
[00:51:46.339 --> 00:51:46.839]  Stay with us.
[00:51:51.064 --> 00:51:55.306]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.
[00:51:55.426 --> 00:51:58.227]  Now you can do even more to hear Genesis shows in your area.

[00:52:21.863 --> 00:52:24.344]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:52:24.804 --> 00:52:26.705]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.425 --> 00:52:30.607]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.247 --> 00:52:37.710]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:53:02.187 --> 00:53:03.768]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:04.088 --> 00:53:05.249]  Defending our borders.
[00:53:05.269 --> 00:53:07.310]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:08.551]  Fighting the American Union.
[00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:11.312]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:11.433 --> 00:53:13.374]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:53:13.674 --> 00:53:16.135]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:16.776 --> 00:53:17.676]  Call Alex now.
[00:53:17.937 --> 00:53:18.757]  Toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:27.132]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.650]  That's right.
[00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:32.692]  We just officially syndicated the broadcast today.
[00:53:33.192 --> 00:53:34.593]  Been working on it the last few weeks.
[00:53:35.133 --> 00:53:36.033]  This is the second hour.
[00:53:36.073 --> 00:53:38.555]  We're here Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:53:39.055 --> 00:53:41.356]  from the studios of NewsRadio 590 KLBJ.
[00:53:41.436 --> 00:53:42.837]  We're going to add some more 1A underlines.
[00:53:42.857 --> 00:53:46.498]  I know those lines have been filled up as soon as we hang up on one that they fill up.
[00:53:46.918 --> 00:53:49.920]  But I'd also like to get local listeners here in Central Texas at 836-0590.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.861]  Let me just recap some of the news.
[00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:55.162]  We've been covering some of the stuff that's coming up in this hour.
[00:53:55.182 --> 00:53:58.384]  We'll go right back to your call, Rick, and others that are patiently...
[00:53:58.857 --> 00:53:59.478]  We're good to go.
[00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:24.237]  To Google Networks, and the government's already doing this, folks.
[00:54:24.257 --> 00:54:25.858]  It's just Google's now announcing they're going to do it.
[00:54:26.118 --> 00:54:35.443]  We'll record everything that goes on in your house, what you're listening to on the radio, TV, what you're saying, and use it to then profile you psychologically for marketing.
[00:54:35.463 --> 00:54:37.824]  I mean, this is what the register had to say about it.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:56.533]  The idea is to use the existing PC microphone to listen to whatever is heard in the background, be it music, your phone going off, or the TV turned down, the PC then identifies it using fingerprinting and then shows you relevant content, whether that's adverts or search results, or a chat room on the subject reports the register.
[00:54:56.833 --> 00:55:04.198]  This is in real time, and they say, oh, because it's the computer doing it, the AI software, it's okay, it's not a person.
[00:55:04.833 --> 00:55:07.255]  Total violation of your privacy.
[00:55:07.275 --> 00:55:13.040]  So people say, oh, you know, 1984 where there's cameras in your house and cameras on the streets, it'll never happen.
[00:55:13.661 --> 00:55:20.267]  Now it's happening and they report it dryly and people, the news just reported on it like it was no big deal and people then buy into it.
[00:55:21.347 --> 00:55:21.808]  By the way,
[00:55:22.501 --> 00:55:29.246]  About two months ago, the Houston police chief called for making people put cameras in their houses in high crime neighborhoods.
[00:55:29.806 --> 00:55:34.430]  In Chicago and in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the last two weeks.
[00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.051]  I have the articles here today in my stack.
[00:55:36.271 --> 00:55:37.532]  Came out and said, we're going to make...
[00:55:38.252 --> 00:55:41.135]  Businesses take cameras and the government's going to be hooked into it.
[00:55:41.535 --> 00:55:42.756]  This is Big Brother.
[00:55:42.916 --> 00:55:48.461]  Did you know that most of the cameras the feds have put in, dual use, are being used for traffic, but also for surveilling you?
[00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:51.663]  They have license plate scanning and reading technology.
[00:55:52.044 --> 00:55:53.585]  They have face scanning technology.
[00:55:54.526 --> 00:55:55.867]  That's why four horse towns are...
[00:55:56.443 --> 00:55:59.284]  One-horse towns at four-way stops.
[00:55:59.445 --> 00:56:02.306]  It's a one-horse town, but four-way stops at one-horse towns.
[00:56:02.366 --> 00:56:04.367]  I'm now doing ebonics here on air.
[00:56:05.167 --> 00:56:06.868]  That's why there's cameras there.
[00:56:06.888 --> 00:56:10.210]  MIT Magazine reported the Pentagon designed it.
[00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:16.573]  It is a military control grid under NORTHCOM's control, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[00:56:16.793 --> 00:56:19.515]  We are in a control prison system.
[00:56:19.795 --> 00:56:21.136]  It is a grid of surveillance.
[00:56:21.556 --> 00:56:22.036]  All right, I'm going to...
[00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:25.812]  I'm going to go to your calls right now, but I want to get your take on this.
[00:56:25.892 --> 00:56:33.036]  I want to get your take on the video that was released last Friday, nine days ago, of Muhammad Adam, one of the other hijackers.
[00:56:33.296 --> 00:56:35.777]  Turns out it was CG, fake video.
[00:56:36.578 --> 00:56:37.218]  This is admitted.
[00:56:37.598 --> 00:56:42.601]  It was aired a year ago in the road to Guantanamo, and the government released this to the filmmakers.
[00:56:43.062 --> 00:56:43.962]  It's fake.
[00:56:44.743 --> 00:56:48.805]  But they think we're so dumb, a video they've already brought out in a docudrama,
[00:56:49.617 --> 00:56:58.899]  They release it again and claim Al-Qaeda released it and terrorize people for a week saying that Al-Qaeda released this to activate their sleeper cells.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.100]  And again, you won't now hear about this on the mainstream media.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.321]  You may see a few reports on it.
[00:57:03.581 --> 00:57:06.281]  We've broken this, but it's totally admitted.
[00:57:06.381 --> 00:57:09.702]  It's in the Road to Guantanamo documentary from a year ago.
[00:57:09.722 --> 00:57:10.803]  Okay, the lines are loaded up here.
[00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:14.023]  Let's go to Rick in Bolton, Texas.
[00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:15.084]  Welcome, sir.
[00:57:15.204 --> 00:57:15.864]  Thank you for holding.
[00:57:17.686 --> 00:57:18.386]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:57:18.806 --> 00:57:19.487]  Great show.
[00:57:19.987 --> 00:57:20.267]  Thank you.
[00:57:21.027 --> 00:57:28.608]  I just wanted to tell you that I listen to Rush Limbaugh for 30 minutes every weekday when I'm at lunch.
[00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:35.470]  You're right about the assault on children by these monsters.
[00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:45.392]  On Bill O'Reilly's show, they played a clip on Rush's show where one of the CIA people said that one of the terrorists, one of the top guys,
[00:57:46.038 --> 00:57:51.242]  They were waterboarding him and he lasted longer than anybody.
[00:57:51.943 --> 00:58:00.989]  They finally had him weeping like a schoolgirl because they threatened his children who were captured in the same raid that he was captured in.
[00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:07.995]  We know that what you were talking about is true even if you don't have a computer and you don't have access to the Internet.
[00:58:08.595 --> 00:58:10.397]  They're openly putting it on the radio.
[00:58:12.717 --> 00:58:13.617]  You know, they captured children.
[00:58:13.637 --> 00:58:14.917]  Hey, but that's what the good guys do.
[00:58:14.977 --> 00:58:17.818]  The good guys, by the way, they don't threaten to torture children.
[00:58:18.118 --> 00:58:20.539]  The Army's own report says they kill them.
[00:58:21.439 --> 00:58:22.679]  They kill children.
[00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:23.779]  They blow their heads off.
[00:58:24.159 --> 00:58:25.160]  They torture them to death.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.560]  They rape them with acid.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.621]  We're taking a page from the Orientals, evidently.
[00:58:31.201 --> 00:58:33.381]  Well, you go read Tugumbu's report.
[00:58:33.421 --> 00:58:34.441]  They take underage people.
[00:58:34.461 --> 00:58:35.562]  That's what they call them in the report.
[00:58:35.902 --> 00:58:40.283]  And I can't say what else they do with the acid, but they, well, just can you imagine?
[00:58:40.303 --> 00:58:41.723]  It's Jeffrey Dahmer stuff, sir.
[00:58:42.475 --> 00:58:44.757]  May I have a snail mail address for you, please?
[00:58:45.057 --> 00:58:45.318]  Sure.
[00:58:45.558 --> 00:58:46.199]  Let me give it to you.
[00:58:46.859 --> 00:58:48.661]  And this is not my office, okay?
[00:58:49.882 --> 00:58:51.123]  It's a place I've used for years.
[00:58:51.203 --> 00:58:52.605]  I cannot get out of my actual office.
[00:58:52.905 --> 00:58:54.086]  I have a drop box in there.
[00:58:54.106 --> 00:58:56.208]  If I gave out my office, I'd be besieged.
[00:58:56.608 --> 00:58:59.311]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:59:04.045 --> 00:59:04.385]  Okay?
[00:59:04.666 --> 00:59:06.887]  And I've been using it for almost 13 years.
[00:59:07.207 --> 00:59:08.448]  It's my dad's dental office.
[00:59:08.789 --> 00:59:10.590]  And you guys go in there and bug him every day.
[00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:11.871]  And there's a drop box in there.
[00:59:12.151 --> 00:59:13.812]  Please don't accost him when you go in there.
[00:59:14.233 --> 00:59:20.137]  But, yes, it's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:59:20.317 --> 00:59:21.358]  I also have a P.O.
[00:59:21.378 --> 00:59:23.720]  Box on Infowars.com.
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:27.903]  I don't have time to... Yeah, I've got time for one more call before we go to break here.
[00:59:28.792 --> 00:59:29.212]  Hi, how are you Alex?
[00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:29.933]  Yes, I'm very worried too.
[00:59:58.026 --> 01:00:05.811]  I have been researching a lot of things that you said, and I found a couple of things that I haven't found anywhere else.
[01:00:06.572 --> 01:00:09.053]  Searching the NWO.
[01:00:09.413 --> 01:00:10.194]  Okay, what is that?
[01:00:10.834 --> 01:00:11.895]  Order of Malta.
[01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:18.299]  It's some kind of religion that they're using that is connected with the EUC.
[01:00:18.319 --> 01:00:23.202]  Well, ma'am, the Order of Malta is a Catholic...
[01:00:23.618 --> 01:00:24.158]  We're good to go.
[01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:48.580]  Liz has said they have the Grand Priory of Bohemia.
[01:01:01.776 --> 01:01:04.397]  And there's a lot of, they have a big interconnection.
[01:01:04.597 --> 01:01:08.839]  That's referring to a province outside Czechoslovakia, I believe.
[01:01:08.859 --> 01:01:11.661]  When you hear about the same name, Bohemia, that's a region.
[01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:17.703]  And then because of a group of artists in Bohemia, then you get the more modern, last 200 years, current Bohemian.
[01:01:17.943 --> 01:01:24.806]  So when the people on the West Coast set up kind of a branch of skull and bones, it's known as the Bohemian Grove.
[01:01:24.826 --> 01:01:25.907]  That's the name of the grove.
[01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.973]  So you don't think this religion has nothing to do with it?
[01:01:29.993 --> 01:01:33.477]  Well, I don't believe that the particular
[01:01:34.413 --> 01:01:36.275]  Order of... Is it Yalter?
[01:01:36.295 --> 01:01:42.540]  I just haven't seen that on my radar screen because I don't think it's a religion in and of itself, and I appreciate your call.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.303]  What it is is a fraternal order of Catholics.
[01:01:47.724 --> 01:01:49.365]  But again, I don't claim to be an expert on that.
[01:01:49.425 --> 01:01:50.446]  I can't be an expert on everything.
[01:01:50.706 --> 01:01:53.548]  A lot of talk show hosts will say, I know everything about that.
[01:01:53.969 --> 01:01:57.091]  I don't know that much about that particular subject.
[01:01:57.151 --> 01:01:59.013]  Okay, Doug wants to...
[01:02:00.677 --> 01:02:02.999]  He wants to know what the solutions are to all these problems.
[01:02:03.299 --> 01:02:04.860]  We'll go to Brent and come back and talk to him first.
[01:02:05.081 --> 01:02:06.141]  Then Leo in Dallas.
[01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:10.004]  War games are going to be starting the 23rd in the Persian Gulf.
[01:02:10.065 --> 01:02:10.925]  Global Lightning 07.
[01:02:11.466 --> 01:02:14.268]  Will that be used as a cover for the strike on Iran?
[01:02:14.628 --> 01:02:15.629]  Very important issue.
[01:02:15.669 --> 01:02:16.350]  We'll talk to him.
[01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:18.791]  Also, Mike in Rockfield, Maryland.
[01:02:19.632 --> 01:02:21.794]  He wants to talk about what's been happening.
[01:02:22.544 --> 01:02:23.766]  With the Amish up there.
[01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:26.048]  We'll be all over the map, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:26.388 --> 01:02:30.432]  I'll be glad to answer your questions on the other side.
[01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:33.695]  We'll get into some of the latest Foley revelations, too, I promise.
[01:02:34.256 --> 01:02:39.581]  And Police State USA getting arrested for just telling Cheney you think the war is reprehensible.
[01:02:39.862 --> 01:02:43.745]  We'll be right back from deep in the heart of Texas from the studios of News Radio 590-KOBJ.
[01:02:55.502 --> 01:02:58.664]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:02:59.004 --> 01:03:00.925]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:03:01.326 --> 01:03:08.970]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.671 --> 01:03:16.695]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:17.115 --> 01:03:20.037]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:03:20.377 --> 01:03:22.758]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[01:03:23.179 --> 01:03:24.019]  NSA spies.

[01:03:51.937 --> 01:03:52.377]  Gold.
[01:03:52.717 --> 01:03:53.998]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:03:54.258 --> 01:04:00.341]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:04:00.522 --> 01:04:04.364]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:04:04.704 --> 01:04:06.605]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:04:06.645 --> 01:04:08.926]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:04:09.086 --> 01:04:14.889]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[01:04:14.929 --> 01:04:15.309]  We're good to go.
[01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:37.584]  For the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[01:05:52.768 --> 01:06:01.297]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:06:01.518 --> 01:06:03.320]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.661]  That's one in four adults.

[01:07:12.703 --> 01:07:14.384]  That's right, they're going to add more 1-800 lines.
[01:07:14.404 --> 01:07:19.205]  I'm really flattered by all the hoops that...
[01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:27.528]  KLBJ and MS have been jumping through to get this show up and syndicated.
[01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:28.749]  I appreciate it.
[01:07:28.869 --> 01:07:31.972]  Through the Genesis Communications Radio Network, they've done a great job as well.
[01:07:32.012 --> 01:07:33.973]  And next week, I'm told, we'll have more 1-800 lines.
[01:07:34.293 --> 01:07:36.975]  Those have been jammed completely, and then the local lines are all jammed up.
[01:07:36.995 --> 01:07:39.217]  I think there's one open now, 836-0590.
[01:07:39.577 --> 01:07:45.081]  If you're outside Texas or outside Central Texas, you can put a 512 in front of that.
[01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:45.362]  512-836-0590.
[01:07:45.382 --> 01:07:46.723]  Pound 590 for singular wireless customers.
[01:07:46.743 --> 01:07:47.183]  Or toll-free 877-590-590.
[01:07:53.137 --> 01:07:54.138]  KLBJ.
[01:07:55.399 --> 01:07:58.021]  Okay, let's go straight back to your calls.
[01:07:58.181 --> 01:08:00.343]  Doug in Austin, a little closer to home.
[01:08:00.783 --> 01:08:04.366]  He wants to know what we should do about all of these problems.
[01:08:05.307 --> 01:08:08.409]  Doug, let the fly havoc and release the dogs on me.
[01:08:08.449 --> 01:08:09.030]  What should I do?
[01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:09.930]  What should you do?
[01:08:11.111 --> 01:08:15.715]  I'm one of those guys that used to just look at you on television and didn't know what the heck to say.
[01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:19.718]  And after Bush stuff the election the first time around,
[01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:23.405]  I began to realize maybe something you were saying had some merit.
[01:08:23.425 --> 01:08:26.508]  9-11, all those things really made me start to look.
[01:08:26.948 --> 01:08:33.933]  Now, I've seen your latest DVD, the one that you're talking about on the radio, and I'm afraid.
[01:08:35.634 --> 01:08:37.236]  Well, join the club, brother.
[01:08:37.276 --> 01:08:39.077]  That's why I'm freaking out here on air.
[01:08:39.137 --> 01:08:40.598]  I'm not working on Sunday for nothing.
[01:08:40.918 --> 01:08:41.499]  I don't need to.
[01:08:41.559 --> 01:08:43.320]  I'm just here because I want to warn people.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.702]  I cannot stop wanting to warn people.
[01:08:45.742 --> 01:08:47.023]  I have this desire.
[01:08:47.043 --> 01:08:48.364]  You know, you ask what solutions are.
[01:08:49.406 --> 01:08:51.187]  It's still warning the people.
[01:08:51.347 --> 01:08:53.729]  It's still, because the average police officer is good.
[01:08:53.769 --> 01:08:56.491]  The average person in federal service is good.
[01:08:56.551 --> 01:08:58.512]  The average American is a good person.
[01:08:58.773 --> 01:08:59.813]  We're naive.
[01:09:00.093 --> 01:09:01.154]  We don't know history.
[01:09:01.234 --> 01:09:06.218]  We don't know that corruption and evil is the norm and that liberty is incredibly rare.
[01:09:06.458 --> 01:09:10.060]  People don't know there's almost 4 trillion missing from the Pentagon, even though it was in the...
[01:09:11.323 --> 01:09:11.843]  We're good to go.
[01:09:37.879 --> 01:09:41.800]  Get rid of the electronic no-paper-ballot voting machines.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.081]  Seal our borders.
[01:09:43.141 --> 01:09:44.921]  Put a fence along the 2,000 miles.
[01:09:46.262 --> 01:09:49.523]  Deport anybody that doesn't swear allegiance to this country.
[01:09:51.063 --> 01:09:57.285]  Indict the individuals who are involved in stealing the trillions at the Pentagon that nobody wants to talk about.
[01:09:57.545 --> 01:09:58.485]  Go after crime.
[01:09:58.565 --> 01:09:59.286]  Get involved.
[01:10:00.846 --> 01:10:04.947]  Listen, we have 60%, 55% turnouts in national elections, my friend.
[01:10:05.387 --> 01:10:06.508]  And then what do we have in...
[01:10:07.742 --> 01:10:08.102]  Local.
[01:10:08.122 --> 01:10:10.363]  What is it, 8% in Austin?
[01:10:10.543 --> 01:10:11.723]  And that's the national average.
[01:10:11.763 --> 01:10:13.404]  It's like 8.6 or something.
[01:10:13.424 --> 01:10:15.765]  I forget the... It's 8 point something.
[01:10:15.805 --> 01:10:18.445]  The point is, go look it up for yourself.
[01:10:19.086 --> 01:10:20.206]  That's where the real power is.
[01:10:20.246 --> 01:10:21.866]  That's where one person can have an effect.
[01:10:22.267 --> 01:10:26.848]  Listen, we've had gun control bills 10 years ago, 5 years ago, about to pass.
[01:10:27.654 --> 01:10:28.174]  We're good to go.
[01:10:56.347 --> 01:10:59.590]  Every time you get on the field, you're going to make plays.
[01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:00.891]  It's just like sports.
[01:11:01.372 --> 01:11:03.033]  And so everybody's like, what are we going to do?
[01:11:03.073 --> 01:11:03.634]  What are we going to do?
[01:11:03.794 --> 01:11:05.896]  You're not taking my Second Amendment.
[01:11:06.216 --> 01:11:11.901]  They were two votes away from passing transponders in all of the inspection stickers.
[01:11:12.542 --> 01:11:18.987]  And one of my, again, listeners and the guy who's been involved in my TV show called me and said, I was reading the new transportation bill.
[01:11:19.147 --> 01:11:21.490]  They're going to put a tracker chip in all the inspection stickers.
[01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:22.911]  Go to your email, Alex.
[01:11:24.244 --> 01:11:26.226]  So, Mr. Cantoff, my good friend.
[01:11:27.147 --> 01:11:31.512]  So I went and looked in my email, and sure enough, there was the transponders.
[01:11:31.592 --> 01:11:32.893]  We went absolutely ape.
[01:11:33.234 --> 01:11:34.134]  People didn't believe us.
[01:11:34.174 --> 01:11:34.995]  They went and checked it.
[01:11:35.075 --> 01:11:36.177]  It made it in a few papers.
[01:11:36.457 --> 01:11:37.138]  We defeated it.
[01:11:37.498 --> 01:11:37.818]  Okay?
[01:11:38.119 --> 01:11:38.419]  Okay?
[01:11:38.639 --> 01:11:42.283]  One phone call to me, the people at Central Texas taking action, we beat it.
[01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:45.050]  Federally, we've beaten a lot of legislation.
[01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:48.751]  So if you'll just get up off your hind ends and take action, we can beat this thing.
[01:11:49.391 --> 01:11:52.232]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[01:11:52.252 --> 01:11:53.872]  Then we'll go to Leo, Mike, and others.
[01:11:54.492 --> 01:11:55.692]  Dave, thank you for holding.
[01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:57.332]  You're on the air worldwide, sir.
[01:11:58.613 --> 01:11:59.093]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:12:00.813 --> 01:12:01.633]  Okay, Dave.
[01:12:01.653 --> 01:12:05.914]  We're going to have to let Dave in Cincinnati, Ohio, go.
[01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:07.154]  I sure wanted to hear his question.
[01:12:07.474 --> 01:12:10.415]  He was asking, how are they using our webcams?
[01:12:10.755 --> 01:12:12.235]  Can they turn them on at will?
[01:12:13.157 --> 01:12:14.017]  Let me be specific.
[01:12:16.359 --> 01:12:22.802]  Dave, you need to go to Google, the very culprits doing this, and type in our headline.
[01:12:22.962 --> 01:12:23.302]  Why?
[01:12:23.442 --> 01:12:24.422]  Why type in our headline?
[01:12:25.123 --> 01:12:32.526]  Because when you go to my articles, every line or every paragraph, usually every line, is a hyperlink to every claim we make.
[01:12:32.886 --> 01:12:33.987]  You'll have the register.
[01:12:34.067 --> 01:12:35.527]  I think there's a link in Reuters in here.
[01:12:35.547 --> 01:12:40.910]  You'll have a link, most importantly, to Google, where you can read their big research division and their public findings and their announcements.
[01:12:41.394 --> 01:12:43.377]  Google is announcing this, okay?
[01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:51.148]  And just type into Google, government industry to use computer microphones to spy on 150 million Americans.
[01:12:51.168 --> 01:12:52.450]  By the way, I think Google has a great product.
[01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:53.331]  I use them, I plug them.
[01:12:53.531 --> 01:12:54.813]  I'm very upset about them doing this.
[01:12:55.934 --> 01:12:56.515]  So here it is.
[01:12:56.595 --> 01:12:58.478]  Invasive surveillance and advertising.
[01:12:59.497 --> 01:13:02.178]  Obliterates even minority report style technology.
[01:13:02.218 --> 01:13:03.018]  It's much worse than that.
[01:13:03.398 --> 01:13:04.758]  And every claim we make is in there.
[01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:05.679]  It's mainstream news.
[01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.719]  And it talks about how TiVo tracks everything you watch.
[01:13:09.199 --> 01:13:12.820]  It talks about how the scientific Atlantic cable boxes do it with links.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.141]  It has the register talking about it.
[01:13:15.201 --> 01:13:16.521]  And so what it does is this.
[01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:20.102]  They're saying, how does the NSA work?
[01:13:20.742 --> 01:13:22.102]  Back 10 years ago, I told you about it.
[01:13:22.122 --> 01:13:22.703]  People laughed at me.
[01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:24.123]  Oh, the NSA can't listen to you.
[01:13:24.423 --> 01:13:26.263]  Oh, they don't have computers that listen to keywords.
[01:13:26.544 --> 01:13:27.604]  It's already been declassified.
[01:13:28.024 --> 01:13:28.224]  Okay.
[01:13:29.017 --> 01:13:29.718]  We're good to go.
[01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:29.998]  I think?
[01:13:48.348 --> 01:13:50.069]  Go look it up for yourself.
[01:14:16.804 --> 01:14:33.622]  And so now Google, with the same technology, and they've teamed up with the government, is going to be using keyword with the microphone built into most new computers, listening to everything you say, your radio, your TV, getting your taste, getting a true psychological algorithm assessment, these are the terms they use, of exactly who you are.
[01:14:34.199 --> 01:14:34.520]  Okay?
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:38.664]  You may lie on some psych test and try to fool it, folks, but you can't lie to what you're really doing.
[01:14:38.824 --> 01:14:42.288]  This makes cookies in your computer tracking what you do totally obsolete.
[01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:48.174]  So we're going to break here in just a... Oh, no, I've got a minute.
[01:14:48.475 --> 01:14:50.076]  This new clock, folks, has got me flustered.
[01:14:50.096 --> 01:14:50.877]  I've got a minute or two.
[01:14:51.578 --> 01:14:56.223]  And this is how... Understand, if somebody came to your door and went...
[01:14:57.028 --> 01:14:57.748]  Knock, knock, knock.
[01:14:57.788 --> 01:15:08.971]  This is Billy Bob from Google, and we'd like to pay you to put a microphone in your house to record everything you're saying with computers analyzing it and putting it in your file to sell it to the government and private industry.
[01:15:09.591 --> 01:15:11.631]  We're going to offer you $100 a week.
[01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:13.111]  You'd say, get out of here!
[01:15:13.572 --> 01:15:19.373]  Unless you're some freak who likes to display yourself, an exhibitionist.
[01:15:21.261 --> 01:15:28.463]  Now, Nielsen comes to you and says, we want to put a machine on your computer, or a machine on your TV, and pay you, and watch your listening habits.
[01:15:28.503 --> 01:15:29.044]  You say, sure.
[01:15:29.064 --> 01:15:33.925]  Or, you know, Arbitron says, hey, would you like to fill out this book about what you listen to?
[01:15:34.205 --> 01:15:35.646]  You know, things like that.
[01:15:36.026 --> 01:15:37.086]  We're not talking about this.
[01:15:37.106 --> 01:15:39.747]  We're talking about, without asking you, it's already happening.
[01:15:39.807 --> 01:15:45.789]  Microphones and cameras that are hooked up to your computer are recording what you're doing with NSA-style systems, okay?
[01:15:45.969 --> 01:15:46.889]  Let me just announce it.
[01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:47.610]  It's huge.
[01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:48.790]  It should be a huge story.
[01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.911]  The only place it's huge is at prisonplanet.com.
[01:15:52.132 --> 01:15:53.972]  We'll be right back from the studios of NewsRadio 590K.

[01:16:52.732 --> 01:16:55.373]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[01:16:55.693 --> 01:16:57.893]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.914]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.

[01:17:17.817 --> 01:17:20.240]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.605]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.

[01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:50.314]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:18:51.475 --> 01:18:55.539]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:59.143]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:18:59.303 --> 01:19:02.747]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:19:03.044 --> 01:19:06.307]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:19:06.327 --> 01:19:11.791]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:21.458]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:19:21.599 --> 01:19:22.880]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:28.364]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:19:28.863 --> 01:19:33.304]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:19:33.364 --> 01:19:34.724]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:38.785]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:19:38.825 --> 01:19:39.565]  That toll-free number again?
[01:19:39.585 --> 01:19:39.645]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:19:39.665 --> 01:19:41.085]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:00.763]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:04.085 --> 01:20:05.346]  Agree or disagree?
[01:20:05.766 --> 01:20:08.587]  Alex wants to hear from you right now at 877-590-5525.
[01:20:09.428 --> 01:20:13.570]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:20:16.072 --> 01:20:16.952]  All right, I love it.
[01:20:16.972 --> 01:20:17.852]  It's great to be here.
[01:20:17.872 --> 01:20:20.314]  I'm glad you're spending a Sunday afternoon with us.
[01:20:20.374 --> 01:20:22.075]  It is so beautiful here in Central Texas.
[01:20:22.095 --> 01:20:24.476]  I would imagine it's quite lovely in your part of the world.
[01:20:24.516 --> 01:20:25.657]  But these...
[01:20:26.525 --> 01:20:28.726]  These October days, the light starts getting at an angle.
[01:20:28.926 --> 01:20:30.006]  I'm looking out the window here.
[01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:31.286]  It's beautiful out there.
[01:20:31.306 --> 01:20:35.467]  It's not as beautiful as that music, George Bush's favorite.
[01:20:35.607 --> 01:20:38.188]  Again, that's George Bush recorded live from Skull and Bones.
[01:20:38.808 --> 01:20:39.608]  This is the president.
[01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:46.550]  Yes, sir, we know you're Christian.
[01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:49.290]  Oh, is that Jeff Gannon, the male prostitute running by?
[01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:49.770]  Excuse me.
[01:20:51.311 --> 01:20:52.591]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:20:53.024 --> 01:20:54.044]  No, I mean, let's get serious.
[01:20:54.845 --> 01:20:56.986]  George Bush does engage in satanic rituals.
[01:20:57.506 --> 01:20:59.587]  And you can say that he's just having fun doing it.
[01:21:00.347 --> 01:21:06.029]  But I assure you, I've interviewed employees of the Bohemian Grove, people who've infiltrated Skull and Bones.
[01:21:06.049 --> 01:21:08.190]  I remember Peter Jennings, before he died, he played a clip.
[01:21:08.210 --> 01:21:09.510]  They got Skull and Bones.
[01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:10.931]  They're going, ah, Satan, die!
[01:21:10.971 --> 01:21:12.351]  And doing the mock stabbings.
[01:21:12.391 --> 01:21:13.492]  He said, they're just having fun.
[01:21:13.932 --> 01:21:16.693]  Yeah, but as old men, they go to Bohemian Grove and do all of this.
[01:21:16.733 --> 01:21:17.813]  And I've been there and witnessed it.
[01:21:18.294 --> 01:21:19.114]  And the president...
[01:21:20.686 --> 01:21:21.066]  We're good to go.
[01:21:21.086 --> 01:21:21.466]  We're good to go.
[01:21:50.883 --> 01:21:53.727]  Let's go ahead and talk to Leo, then Mike, then John, and many others.
[01:21:53.947 --> 01:21:54.728]  John, you stay there.
[01:21:54.748 --> 01:21:55.709]  I'm going to callers in order.
[01:21:55.949 --> 01:22:01.175]  I want to hear this about your college classes are teaching that the patriot movement is domestic terror.
[01:22:01.836 --> 01:22:03.498]  Actually, I have their own training manuals.
[01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:06.722]  What you said is absolutely true, but I want to hear it directly from your mouth.
[01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.844]  Let's talk to Leo in Dallas.
[01:22:08.904 --> 01:22:09.385]  Welcome, sir.
[01:22:10.396 --> 01:22:10.836]  Hey, Alex.
[01:22:10.856 --> 01:22:11.216]  What's up?
[01:22:11.817 --> 01:22:14.598]  Doing a national radio show, and I'm very excited.
[01:22:15.058 --> 01:22:15.899]  I'm glad for you.
[01:22:15.959 --> 01:22:16.579]  I'm really glad.
[01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:22.082]  I've been listening to you about six months now, and I feel like I've been missing out all along.
[01:22:22.142 --> 01:22:30.246]  But I've caught up pretty quickly, and I feel we're in an imminent sense of danger right now through this month.
[01:22:30.927 --> 01:22:33.108]  And at this point, we have...
[01:22:34.469 --> 01:22:39.071]  The Enterprise there in the Arabian Sea, you have the Eisenhower.
[01:22:39.191 --> 01:22:40.211]  Left the West Coast.
[01:22:40.451 --> 01:22:42.472]  Yeah, right.
[01:22:42.512 --> 01:22:50.295]  You have the Eisenhower's left, and then you have Expeditionary Strike Force 5 also going to be there for some ground troops.
[01:22:50.315 --> 01:22:51.775]  And they've beefed.
[01:22:54.326 --> 01:22:56.288]  Man, you're right on as always.
[01:23:19.082 --> 01:23:25.247]  The main thing is we have this global, this is a Stratcom drill.
[01:23:26.188 --> 01:23:29.510]  Stratcom, this all comes out of the Office of Special Plans.
[01:23:30.331 --> 01:23:33.173]  They brought us our lovely Iraq war.
[01:23:33.694 --> 01:23:40.139]  This is very scary because on the 22nd you have a full moon, I mean a new moon, no moon
[01:23:40.966 --> 01:23:42.187]  That's going to be the prime time.
[01:23:42.207 --> 01:23:50.453]  Yeah, that's perfect because the helicopters and warplanes go in with their infrared and a moon blocks out a lot of their vision.
[01:23:51.254 --> 01:23:52.314]  You're right on.
[01:23:52.795 --> 01:23:57.378]  And I would look for the possible false flag here in America.
[01:23:57.398 --> 01:24:00.801]  Tell folks what a false flag is.
[01:24:01.021 --> 01:24:07.546]  A false flag attack is an attack such as any attack that happens on...
[01:24:08.661 --> 01:24:14.686]  The actual country that's doing the attack is usually its own country.
[01:24:14.706 --> 01:24:17.389]  It's more of a self-inflicted wound, much like 9-11.
[01:24:17.729 --> 01:24:24.195]  It's perpetrated to look at an outside threat or some other threat, a made-up threat, a puppet threat.
[01:24:24.597 --> 01:24:28.359]  And then to actually induce fear.
[01:24:28.659 --> 01:24:28.859]  Sure.
[01:24:28.899 --> 01:24:32.901]  I mean, a false flag is somebody burning down their own store.
[01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:34.001]  Oh, those never happen.
[01:24:34.461 --> 01:24:35.882]  That's where cops always look.
[01:24:35.942 --> 01:24:39.164]  Real criminologists always look at the person first, okay?
[01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:41.745]  Because statistically, that's normally who does it.
[01:24:41.965 --> 01:24:43.726]  And boy, with terrorism, it certainly is.
[01:24:44.266 --> 01:24:44.586]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:44.686 --> 01:24:46.447]  If they don't attack them by late October...
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:47.641]  We're good to go.
[01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:05.178]  We're good to go.
[01:25:23.052 --> 01:25:24.352]  Grabbing Taiwan during that.
[01:25:24.372 --> 01:25:33.015]  North Korea is talking about attacking the South, escalating us into World War III, which will make the defense contractors a lot of money, and they'll be able to have a domestic police state crackdown here domestically.
[01:25:33.075 --> 01:25:37.477]  And you won't mind if you have your pension funds taken if we're at war with the evil enemies, will you?
[01:25:37.697 --> 01:25:39.998]  The real target in any war is the U.S.
[01:25:40.378 --> 01:25:43.319]  Wars are really waged by governments against their own populations.
[01:25:43.799 --> 01:25:44.359]  Did you know that?
[01:25:45.271 --> 01:25:49.974]  Again, they may be attacking some foreign country, but the main focus is the domestic homeland.
[01:25:50.614 --> 01:25:51.955]  Let's take another call.
[01:25:52.415 --> 01:25:55.937]  Let's go ahead and... Who's up next here?
[01:25:56.337 --> 01:25:57.378]  Where is... Oh, there it is.
[01:25:57.418 --> 01:26:02.140]  I want to talk to John in Greensboro, North Carolina.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.441]  John, welcome.
[01:26:03.481 --> 01:26:04.862]  You're going out worldwide.
[01:26:05.022 --> 01:26:05.722]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:26:06.262 --> 01:26:07.403]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:26:07.423 --> 01:26:08.123]  How are you doing today?
[01:26:08.263 --> 01:26:08.604]  Good, sir.
[01:26:09.304 --> 01:26:14.647]  Okay, I just wanted to call and tell you that in a college class taught at my college called Terrorism in America...
[01:26:15.299 --> 01:26:19.061]  It specifically makes reference to the Patriot Movement as political terrorists.
[01:26:19.241 --> 01:26:19.782]  Uh-huh, sure.
[01:26:20.422 --> 01:26:24.365]  Yeah, so I just wanted to say that... Because we are the most popular on every issue.
[01:26:24.705 --> 01:26:27.687]  We're not establishment Democrat or Republican hacks working for the elite.
[01:26:28.047 --> 01:26:31.309]  We're against open borders, against the North American Union, against gun control.
[01:26:31.529 --> 01:26:33.230]  We're against high taxes and regulation.
[01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:34.731]  We're against all the issues.
[01:26:34.771 --> 01:26:38.913]  We have Democrats and Republicans loving us because we're just good old-fashioned patriots.
[01:26:39.053 --> 01:26:40.354]  That's why we're called patriots.
[01:26:40.714 --> 01:26:43.356]  And we were the weirdos ten years ago who flew American flags...
[01:26:43.576 --> 01:26:49.079]  Now we don't fly them because it's been expropriated by the neocons to mean that we support the killing of this country.
[01:26:49.119 --> 01:26:50.480]  Sir, have you seen Terror Storm?
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.821]  I have the Texas federally written manual.
[01:26:53.061 --> 01:26:55.222]  I have the North Carolina federally written manual.
[01:26:55.402 --> 01:26:57.183]  I have the Arizona federally written manual.
[01:26:57.323 --> 01:27:03.166]  Then I have the root federal manual with the FBI's phone numbers where they say, people who make references to the Constitution.
[01:27:03.346 --> 01:27:04.987]  Frequent references are terrorists.
[01:27:05.348 --> 01:27:06.689]  Gun groups are terrorists.
[01:27:06.969 --> 01:27:09.471]  Land rights groups activists are terrorists.
[01:27:09.671 --> 01:27:14.194]  People who wear Levi's and talk on cellular phones and have women and children are terrorists.
[01:27:14.434 --> 01:27:15.996]  You think I'm joking, folks.
[01:27:16.276 --> 01:27:20.779]  You can call Homeland Security right here in Austin and ask them for the dirty manual.
[01:27:20.939 --> 01:27:22.440]  They'll give you the dirty manual.
[01:27:22.641 --> 01:27:29.245]  You can go to Google Video and type in Terror Storm and you'll get dozens and dozens of versions of my film that's been uploaded.
[01:27:29.546 --> 01:27:29.986]  Watch it.
[01:27:30.206 --> 01:27:31.867]  My film, it almost cost me $100,000 to make.
[01:27:32.047 --> 01:27:33.487]  It was like $90-something grand.
[01:27:34.527 --> 01:27:37.808]  Go watch my film for free and see all the actual manuals.
[01:27:38.008 --> 01:27:46.771]  We zoom in on the words that say, land rights activist, terrorist, period, terrorist, because the government's the terrorist.
[01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:51.352]  It's been hijacked by criminals, and so they say if we even speak out against them, we're terrorists.
[01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:53.773]  Tell me what these slugs at your college teach you.
[01:27:54.204 --> 01:27:54.825]  No, I know.
[01:27:54.945 --> 01:27:58.247]  I just, you know what, I was going to take the course just as a survey.
[01:27:58.267 --> 01:27:59.829]  Just tell me what the slugs say.
[01:28:00.009 --> 01:28:01.370]  Tell me the name of the particular school.
[01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:02.311]  Tell me the name of the course.
[01:28:02.471 --> 01:28:05.013]  Because I bet you can put the, in fact, I didn't have a pen in here.
[01:28:05.854 --> 01:28:06.975]  Pull the syllabus.
[01:28:07.235 --> 01:28:07.915]  Tell me the school.
[01:28:07.935 --> 01:28:09.376]  I bet I can pull the syllabus right now.
[01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:09.717]  Tell me.
[01:28:09.777 --> 01:28:10.457]  Sure, sure.
[01:28:10.597 --> 01:28:12.859]  It's Guilford College in Greensboro.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:13.780]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:16.002]  Guilford, of course they all teach this, by the way, folks.
[01:28:16.122 --> 01:28:16.642]  UT teaches it.
[01:28:16.662 --> 01:28:18.104]  They have a Homeland Security office there.
[01:28:18.444 --> 01:28:20.125]  A&M, massive facility.
[01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:21.927]  Guilford College where?
[01:28:22.521 --> 01:28:24.122]  In Greensboro, North Carolina, sir.
[01:28:24.162 --> 01:28:26.344]  Okay, what's the name of this Soviet school?
[01:28:26.604 --> 01:28:27.525]  I mean, the Soviet class?
[01:28:28.486 --> 01:28:31.568]  The actual course title is P-S-C-I-3-6-5.
[01:28:31.668 --> 01:28:33.209]  Say it slowly.
[01:28:33.269 --> 01:28:33.850]  P-what?
[01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:35.591]  P-S-N-C-R-S.
[01:28:35.771 --> 01:28:37.712]  C as in candy.
[01:28:38.033 --> 01:28:38.833]  I as in India.
[01:28:39.073 --> 01:28:39.814]  Uh-huh.
[01:28:39.834 --> 01:28:40.154]  3-6-5.
[01:28:40.414 --> 01:28:40.955]  Okay.
[01:28:41.515 --> 01:28:43.637]  And who's the creature that teaches it?
[01:28:44.217 --> 01:28:45.758]  You're going to love this, Alex.
[01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:47.758]  Robert Duncan, Ph.D.
[01:28:47.778 --> 01:28:50.299]  He's a CIA veteran of two decades.
[01:28:50.579 --> 01:28:51.199]  It always is.
[01:28:51.419 --> 01:28:52.579]  They've got them all over the country.
[01:28:52.599 --> 01:28:53.580]  I've got these syllabus.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:54.300]  It's the same thing.
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:29:01.522]  It'll say land rights, environmentalists, all the conservatives, all the liberals, gun rights activists.
[01:29:01.582 --> 01:29:02.162]  It's all listed.
[01:29:02.482 --> 01:29:03.223]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:03.283 --> 01:29:04.743]  I mean, I want to send you this syllabus.
[01:29:04.763 --> 01:29:09.364]  That's why I went in, because I knew what this was all about, and I just need to get my hands on it.
[01:29:09.384 --> 01:29:11.365]  Well, listen, folks who don't believe me, just type in...
[01:29:12.898 --> 01:29:17.802]  FBI, Phoenix, Flyer, Constitutionalists or Terrorists.
[01:29:18.042 --> 01:29:19.003]  Type it into Google.
[01:29:19.043 --> 01:29:19.783]  You'll get that one.
[01:29:20.123 --> 01:29:21.705]  Folks, just go read them.
[01:29:21.765 --> 01:29:24.006]  Oh, you'll think it's fake, so call the number.
[01:29:24.326 --> 01:29:24.907]  FBI?
[01:29:25.487 --> 01:29:27.489]  Yes, I have to have a Constitution.
[01:29:27.509 --> 01:29:28.189]  I don't believe in it.
[01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:30.371]  Yes, well, are you calling?
[01:29:30.391 --> 01:29:32.432]  Well, we have this manual here.
[01:29:32.712 --> 01:29:33.193]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:33.233 --> 01:29:34.133]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:34.434 --> 01:29:35.434]  Final segment.
[01:29:35.474 --> 01:29:37.236]  We enter the vortex.
[01:29:37.776 --> 01:29:40.798]  Go the distance with us, my friends.
[01:29:40.898 --> 01:29:41.939]  Stay the course.
[01:29:42.642 --> 01:29:48.645]  When we get back, I'll tell you about the herbos up in Congress and a lot more.
[01:29:48.945 --> 01:29:50.246]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:52.928 --> 01:29:55.429]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:29:55.549 --> 01:29:57.910]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:29:57.970 --> 01:30:04.174]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:30:05.634 --> 01:30:07.936]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:30:08.596 --> 01:30:12.058]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:30:12.674 --> 01:30:16.816]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:30:17.376 --> 01:30:20.358]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:30:21.318 --> 01:30:24.240]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.601]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:30:27.721 --> 01:30:28.221]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[01:30:28.261 --> 01:30:31.023]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[01:30:31.063 --> 01:30:33.324]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[01:30:42.839 --> 01:30:50.723]  Call 888-8-XANADU, that's 888-8-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[01:30:51.864 --> 01:30:54.045]  Admit it, the moral rot in America runs deep.
[01:30:54.425 --> 01:31:01.029]  Massive debt, rampant materialism, pedophilia by clergy, endless war, and yes, the sin of religious cannibalism.
[01:31:01.309 --> 01:31:07.712]  Communion was practiced by the Aztecs, Egyptians, Babylonians, and Gnostics of the mystery schools long before the Messiah was born.
[01:31:08.053 --> 01:31:10.694]  Due to carefully placed forgeries within the New Covenant texts,
[01:31:10.974 --> 01:31:11.074]  Yeah.
[01:31:37.103 --> 01:31:41.766]  Nostics did hijack the Antigua to fulfill their devious plan to make abomination look holy.
[01:31:42.047 --> 01:31:46.089]  Gnostic conspiracy exposed in Communion, the Blood Fest of Babylon.
[01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:46.490]  Call 325-572-3913.
[01:31:53.032 --> 01:31:55.593]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[01:31:55.913 --> 01:31:57.453]  A tornado under your hood!
[01:31:57.613 --> 01:32:03.395]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[01:32:03.695 --> 01:32:10.777]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[01:32:10.917 --> 01:32:15.698]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[01:32:15.878 --> 01:32:21.420]  Visit tornadoair.com or pick up your tornado at Checker, Shucks, and Cragen today.
[01:32:23.377 --> 01:32:27.120]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:32.184]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[01:32:32.464 --> 01:32:33.925]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[01:32:34.205 --> 01:32:34.426]  No.
[01:32:34.766 --> 01:32:38.529]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[01:32:38.909 --> 01:32:40.270]  Are all covers the same?
[01:32:40.530 --> 01:32:40.750]  No.
[01:32:41.031 --> 01:32:44.713]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:32:45.114 --> 01:32:47.235]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[01:32:47.515 --> 01:32:50.057]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabric's got you covered.
[01:32:50.318 --> 01:32:52.099]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:32:52.419 --> 01:33:00.361]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:33:00.822 --> 01:33:03.983]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:33:04.363 --> 01:33:07.384]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[01:33:55.571 --> 01:33:59.914]  Thank you for listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:34:05.496 --> 01:34:10.200]  Alex Jones is deep in the heart of Texas, and he wants to talk to you.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.182]  Toll free, 877-590-5525.
[01:34:16.185 --> 01:34:17.186]  All right, final segment.
[01:34:17.226 --> 01:34:19.828]  Well, these two hours just explode past us, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:20.649 --> 01:34:26.293]  Coming to you from the historic and beautiful studios of NewsRadio 590, KOBJ, now syndicated nationwide.
[01:34:27.574 --> 01:34:27.934]  All right.
[01:34:29.065 --> 01:34:33.967]  We've got a caller who disagrees, so Burton in North Austin will go ahead of Mike and others that are holding.
[01:34:34.008 --> 01:34:36.609]  But I promised to get to this news, so let me just briefly get to it.
[01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:46.834]  Let me just calmly tell you that if you think Foley, chasing a bunch of underage pages around drunkenly,
[01:34:47.574 --> 01:34:56.662]  For years and years, six-term congressman, folks, that is literally not even one molecule off the type of the iceberg.
[01:34:57.082 --> 01:35:07.291]  Prostitutes of every age and configuration are as ubiquitous in Washington as water fountains or as napkins in the bathroom.
[01:35:07.331 --> 01:35:09.273]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:35:09.393 --> 01:35:10.414]  It's totally corrupt.
[01:35:10.454 --> 01:35:11.355]  It's out of control.
[01:35:11.795 --> 01:35:14.458]  And you don't get into these super hot positions in most cases.
[01:35:15.146 --> 01:35:17.569]  And in the committee chairman positions, unless you're compromised.
[01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:25.219]  Whether it be underage, men, women, boys, girls, money laundering, payoffs, I mean, it's just constant.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:30.946]  And I'm more concerned with the fact that there's pedophilia going on, and that came out in the late 80s.
[01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:34.272]  Just type in Pedophile Scandal White House.
[01:35:34.552 --> 01:35:35.973]  You'll get Washington Times, AP.
[01:35:35.993 --> 01:35:38.055]  You'll get the big front page headlines.
[01:35:38.075 --> 01:35:38.856]  They've all been scammed.
[01:35:38.876 --> 01:35:39.517]  They're on the web.
[01:35:39.797 --> 01:35:41.018]  We've been covering this for years.
[01:35:41.318 --> 01:35:42.599]  You know, underage call boys.
[01:35:42.639 --> 01:35:46.483]  We're talking 14, 15 years old by the dozen in the White House.
[01:35:46.743 --> 01:35:51.927]  And they stole some of Dolly Madison's, you know, the First Lady, some of her silverware.
[01:35:52.208 --> 01:35:53.529]  I mean, it was a huge scandal.
[01:35:53.989 --> 01:35:54.930]  So just go read it.
[01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:56.311]  And it's such a rat hole.
[01:35:56.652 --> 01:35:59.274]  Once you go down this rat hole, I'm not even going to talk about it on air.
[01:35:59.614 --> 01:36:01.435]  I want you to go read it all for yourself.
[01:36:01.775 --> 01:36:07.459]  Because Jeff Gannon, the gay madams and the porn stars, well, that was two years ago.
[01:36:07.539 --> 01:36:09.600]  I mean, it just... I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:10.761]  It was in mainstream news in the 80s.
[01:36:10.821 --> 01:36:12.742]  It was in the news last year.
[01:36:12.782 --> 01:36:16.304]  They bus in the top porn stars to service them.
[01:36:16.384 --> 01:36:20.646]  And this is Christian conservative Republicans at Bohemian Grove, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:20.726 --> 01:36:28.070]  And, I mean, it's just... This stuff is so bad that it's hard to even be able to deal with.
[01:36:28.111 --> 01:36:28.811]  And it's just the truth.
[01:36:29.355 --> 01:36:31.477]  I mean, listen, I can't get away with what I'm doing if I wasn't telling the truth.
[01:36:31.677 --> 01:36:33.098]  I've got sources for everything I say.
[01:36:33.498 --> 01:36:34.059]  In triplicate.
[01:36:34.879 --> 01:36:36.400]  And then there's this, and we'll go to some final calls.
[01:36:36.681 --> 01:36:39.262]  A man arrested for criticizing Cheney files a lawsuit.
[01:36:39.282 --> 01:36:40.123]  I told you about this.
[01:36:40.243 --> 01:36:40.924]  I interviewed him.
[01:36:41.764 --> 01:36:42.445]  He walked by.
[01:36:43.317 --> 01:36:48.058]  And he simply said, with his eight-year-old son, he said, I think the war is reprehensible from about five feet away.
[01:36:48.078 --> 01:36:48.798]  This is all admitted.
[01:36:48.998 --> 01:36:54.479]  The Secret Service demanded he be charged with assault, calling it verbal assault, and finally it got dropped.
[01:36:54.759 --> 01:36:55.299]  Here's one.
[01:36:55.879 --> 01:36:56.839]  These are all over the country.
[01:36:56.859 --> 01:36:58.100]  The latest is October 3rd.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.880]  Lafayette student arrested for allegedly bringing a gun to school.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:01.760]  Then you read it.
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.220]  It says it was a plastic toy gun.
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.061]  He was charged with terrorism for the crime of terrorizing.
[01:37:06.241 --> 01:37:07.121]  He didn't point at anybody.
[01:37:07.141 --> 01:37:08.361]  He had the toy gun to show it to friends.
[01:37:08.641 --> 01:37:11.782]  Plastic gun to help you buy at any Walgreens or wherever.
[01:37:11.802 --> 01:37:12.482]  A little plastic gun.
[01:37:13.087 --> 01:37:14.007]  And that's it, folks.
[01:37:14.027 --> 01:37:14.488]  He's a terrorist.
[01:37:14.828 --> 01:37:15.768]  Everything is terrorism.
[01:37:16.368 --> 01:37:18.469]  And then I'm not going to spend long on this.
[01:37:18.509 --> 01:37:19.629]  I'm not into potty humor.
[01:37:20.049 --> 01:37:21.370]  This is the Ananova headline.
[01:37:21.390 --> 01:37:23.031]  The BBC said the same thing.
[01:37:24.211 --> 01:37:27.212]  Police hunt farting dissidents.
[01:37:28.382 --> 01:37:35.985]  And it says that police in Poland have launched a nationwide hunt for a man who passed gas loudly when asked what he thought of the president.
[01:37:36.525 --> 01:37:40.907]  And it says Hubert Hoffman, 45, was charged with contempt for the office of the head of the state.
[01:37:40.927 --> 01:37:42.527]  See, we don't want that to happen here now.
[01:37:42.888 --> 01:37:45.489]  And under the new bill they passed a week and a half ago, they can do this.
[01:37:46.369 --> 01:37:54.712]  He said that he complained that President Leach Kozinski and his twin brother, the country is returning to a communist-style dictatorship.
[01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:58.538]  It said he was at a routine checkpoint, like we have here now, Freedom.
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:00.643]  And he didn't show up for courts.
[01:38:00.663 --> 01:38:02.548]  It was a nationwide manhunt for treason.
[01:38:03.746 --> 01:38:04.646]  We don't want to turn into that.
[01:38:05.327 --> 01:38:06.667]  Let's go to Burton in North Austin.
[01:38:06.687 --> 01:38:07.527]  He says he disagrees.
[01:38:07.567 --> 01:38:08.668]  You are a chicken little.
[01:38:09.068 --> 01:38:12.169]  The sky is not falling, he says.
[01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:14.669]  I never said the sky was falling, sir.
[01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:15.910]  I covered real news.
[01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:17.630]  What have I said that isn't true?
[01:38:17.710 --> 01:38:22.352]  Is Google not announcing they're going to listen to you over microphones without telling you at your house?
[01:38:22.432 --> 01:38:24.752]  Did North Korea send troops across?
[01:38:24.872 --> 01:38:26.573]  Are they talking about going into Iran?
[01:38:26.893 --> 01:38:28.113]  Are we losing our freedoms?
[01:38:28.594 --> 01:38:31.094]  What am I saying that isn't true?
[01:38:31.154 --> 01:38:31.714]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:38:32.655 --> 01:38:33.435]  You're on the air, Burton.
[01:38:35.253 --> 01:38:35.953]  Okay, there you go.
[01:38:35.973 --> 01:38:38.114]  I, uh, I, uh... Excuse me, my man.
[01:38:38.474 --> 01:38:39.454]  Get the buttons right.
[01:38:39.474 --> 01:38:41.475]  You got a real thing going.
[01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:42.395]  No, I went to the buttons.
[01:38:42.415 --> 01:38:42.715]  Go ahead.
[01:38:42.755 --> 01:38:43.535]  That's a nice little trick.
[01:38:43.555 --> 01:38:43.835]  Go ahead.
[01:38:44.055 --> 01:38:44.536]  All right.
[01:38:44.796 --> 01:38:47.656]  Hey, you know, you do sound like Chicken Little a lot of the time.
[01:38:47.696 --> 01:38:48.096]  Okay, great.
[01:38:48.117 --> 01:38:49.317]  Yeah, I'll just stick my head in the sand.
[01:38:49.437 --> 01:38:52.758]  I guess the Founding Fathers did, too, saying we were losing our liberties and our freedoms.
[01:38:52.778 --> 01:38:54.678]  Do you think cameras going up in your neighborhoods are freedom?
[01:38:55.118 --> 01:38:57.679]  Hey, I'm not looking for cameras going up in my neighborhood.
[01:38:57.999 --> 01:38:59.880]  But I'm not looking for a lot of false things.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:02.340]  I'm not looking for a lot of... Oh, it's false.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.861]  Cameras aren't going up.
[01:39:03.961 --> 01:39:04.241]  I see.
[01:39:04.301 --> 01:39:04.561]  Okay.
[01:39:05.348 --> 01:39:07.270]  Uh, man, you keep talking and talking.
[01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:09.071]  Come on, let me hear some facts, okay?
[01:39:09.111 --> 01:39:10.012]  Let me hear some facts.
[01:39:10.052 --> 01:39:11.293]  What have I said that isn't true?
[01:39:11.753 --> 01:39:13.034]  What have you said that isn't true?
[01:39:13.054 --> 01:39:13.894]  Yeah, let's hear it, buddy.
[01:39:14.235 --> 01:39:16.737]  I haven't picked out anything you said that wasn't true.
[01:39:16.757 --> 01:39:21.740]  Well, then you're calling in to disagree with me because I'm telling you we're losing our liberties and our freedom.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:26.964]  Did you know the North American Union, the end of this country, and under that system we won't have due process for private property.
[01:39:27.144 --> 01:39:28.765]  Did you know we're losing our country right now?
[01:39:28.966 --> 01:39:30.086]  It's officially been signed.
[01:39:30.206 --> 01:39:33.449]  They're already having secret trilateral meetings with the heads of state.
[01:39:33.903 --> 01:39:37.005]  All I called in to say was you're screaming like Chicken Little, man.
[01:39:37.045 --> 01:39:38.865]  The sky is falling, the sky is falling.
[01:39:38.885 --> 01:39:42.307]  You don't seem to be able to accept the constructive criticism.
[01:39:42.327 --> 01:39:43.488]  No, I am ready to get it.
[01:39:43.608 --> 01:39:45.148]  I want to hear what I'm saying.
[01:39:45.328 --> 01:39:46.409]  Chicken Little was wrong.
[01:39:46.589 --> 01:39:47.790]  The sky wasn't falling.
[01:39:48.010 --> 01:39:49.831]  Okay, number one, I'm not saying the sky is falling.
[01:39:49.971 --> 01:39:51.711]  Number two, I'm not saying things that are false.
[01:39:52.052 --> 01:39:54.733]  You tell me what I'm saying that isn't true.
[01:39:55.093 --> 01:39:58.735]  No, you just sound like Matt Drudge who rages on and on and on.
[01:39:58.895 --> 01:40:00.195]  Oh, give me a break.
[01:40:00.235 --> 01:40:03.497]  Went across because he's so angry and PO'd
[01:40:03.817 --> 01:40:05.278]  That nobody gets his point.
[01:40:05.338 --> 01:40:05.979]  But you're listening.
[01:40:06.319 --> 01:40:06.759]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:06.899 --> 01:40:08.140]  He's just gone all over the country.
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.001]  Nobody gets his point.
[01:40:09.141 --> 01:40:12.043]  My man, I listen to every radio station all the time.
[01:40:12.103 --> 01:40:14.905]  I'm glad you're listening to... I guess you're listening to 590 here in Austin?
[01:40:15.405 --> 01:40:16.426]  Oh, you got it, man.
[01:40:16.826 --> 01:40:19.548]  If you listened to 590 here in Austin, you'd know who I am.
[01:40:20.368 --> 01:40:21.429]  Well, my gosh, sir.
[01:40:21.489 --> 01:40:22.890]  I have to learn how powerful you are.
[01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:23.791]  There you go.
[01:40:23.811 --> 01:40:24.411]  I'll step.
[01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:29.030]  Yeah, I'm kind of busy, my friend, but I do listen to NewsRadio 590.
[01:40:29.651 --> 01:40:30.871]  But you are very illustrious.
[01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:33.972]  The next time you call in, we will kneel before you and say, Burton is calling.
[01:40:33.992 --> 01:40:35.132]  In fact, we can get some trumpets.
[01:40:35.332 --> 01:40:42.415]  And maybe we can have someone herald you.
[01:40:42.795 --> 01:40:45.035]  Ladies and gentlemen, what's his name again?
[01:40:45.536 --> 01:40:45.776]  Brett?
[01:40:46.276 --> 01:40:46.436]  Huh?
[01:40:47.518 --> 01:40:58.621]  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lord Burton of Grimshillshire, Archduke of Quimberry, the defender of the crown, guarder of the Sacred Tooth Fairy, and leader of the Snoopies.
[01:40:59.141 --> 01:41:04.803]  What am I supposed to... All right, hey, nice try.
[01:41:05.123 --> 01:41:09.724]  None of you neocons can call in and tell me Bush hasn't... I kept saying doubled.
[01:41:09.764 --> 01:41:10.904]  It was pointed out it's now been tripled.
[01:41:11.344 --> 01:41:14.045]  Tripled the funding of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[01:41:14.565 --> 01:41:15.986]  I know, gun control's conservative.
[01:41:16.006 --> 01:41:16.706]  Just shut up.
[01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:18.954]  Go ahead and try to call me next week.
[01:41:18.994 --> 01:41:20.095]  If you don't, you're afraid.
[01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:22.998]  I'm just having fun here, folks.
[01:41:23.319 --> 01:41:25.281]  I'm telling the truth, and I'm knocking them dead.
[01:41:25.801 --> 01:41:27.864]  Mike in Rockfield, Maryland.
[01:41:28.184 --> 01:41:29.225]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:41:29.245 --> 01:41:30.907]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:41:30.967 --> 01:41:31.228]  You bet.
[01:41:31.248 --> 01:41:31.588]  Thank you.
[01:41:31.908 --> 01:41:35.673]  Thanks to you, LBJ, for having you on the air.
[01:41:35.953 --> 01:41:36.654]  I really appreciate it.
[01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:37.635]  We kneel before him.
[01:41:38.075 --> 01:41:38.875]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:39.335 --> 01:41:44.296]  Well, you know, who were thought insulting the president of Poland would cause such a big stink?
[01:41:44.416 --> 01:41:45.276]  Firing cannons.
[01:41:45.356 --> 01:41:45.796]  Ha-ha!
[01:41:45.856 --> 01:41:46.336]  Good pun!
[01:41:46.397 --> 01:41:46.997]  Double pun!
[01:41:47.277 --> 01:41:47.597]  Okay.
[01:41:47.837 --> 01:41:51.697]  Now, listen, before I ask the question, I'm going to plug our 9-11 Truth Movement here in the D.C.
[01:41:51.777 --> 01:41:52.058]  area.
[01:41:52.638 --> 01:41:53.098]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:53.158 --> 01:41:53.418]  Do it.
[01:41:54.438 --> 01:41:57.358]  www.dc911.org.
[01:41:57.698 --> 01:42:02.199]  We showed your film, Terror Storm, at the Luna Cafe to Pop Turk on the D.C.
[01:42:02.219 --> 01:42:03.900]  You had about 50, 60 people there.
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:04.960]  Well done!
[01:42:06.832 --> 01:42:07.052]  Huh?
[01:42:07.313 --> 01:42:08.554]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[01:42:09.074 --> 01:42:10.616]  Okay, and we're trying to spread the word.
[01:42:11.377 --> 01:42:14.500]  And, you know, I want to encourage people to come out of the shadows.
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.481]  Good.
[01:42:15.641 --> 01:42:16.442]  Don't be afraid.
[01:42:17.202 --> 01:42:22.528]  And so it's really great, you know, it's liberating to tell the truth.
[01:42:22.548 --> 01:42:25.731]  Like on the subway, a war mine, I don't live in truth, we have a t-shirt and
[01:42:26.124 --> 01:42:27.885]  I had people asking me questions, you know?
[01:42:28.185 --> 01:42:31.867]  Yeah, well, Terror Storm made it back into the top 100 Google videos.
[01:42:31.887 --> 01:42:33.148]  That is, of all videos.
[01:42:33.408 --> 01:42:35.149]  They deleted our ratings again.
[01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:36.610]  We're back in the top 100 again.
[01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:40.572]  Even cheating me, we've gotten 4 million views, and we're not going to stop.
[01:42:40.652 --> 01:42:45.114]  So Terror Storm, tell everybody about it, and thank you for showing Terror Storm up there.
[01:42:45.234 --> 01:42:45.874]  I salute you.
[01:42:46.095 --> 01:42:47.775]  What do you think of all the things that are happening?
[01:42:47.815 --> 01:42:54.419]  Why is North Korea, with that psycho running and asking for it, coming across the DMZ today and threatening to test nukes?
[01:42:55.407 --> 01:42:55.968]  I don't know.
[01:42:55.988 --> 01:43:00.675]  There are several ways this could play out.
[01:43:01.476 --> 01:43:03.018]  The globalist agenda.
[01:43:03.038 --> 01:43:05.702]  They have probably several irons in the fire.
[01:43:06.394 --> 01:43:09.496]  It's extremely difficult to second-guess them, you know?
[01:43:09.876 --> 01:43:11.817]  I agree with you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:43:11.857 --> 01:43:12.537]  You keep it up.
[01:43:12.798 --> 01:43:14.979]  And let me just say something to the caller earlier.
[01:43:15.039 --> 01:43:16.179]  His lordship had called in.
[01:43:16.199 --> 01:43:18.160]  You know, I'm Chicken Little.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:33.168]  Hey, man, Google has announced, and a bunch of other companies are admitted they're doing it, to use the microphone standard on most PCs and digital cable boxes, they've announced, by the way, that you listen to the audio and record with computer programs everything you're doing.
[01:43:33.188 --> 01:43:33.649]  Listen.
[01:43:34.389 --> 01:43:41.043]  It's normal to freak out over the fact that microphones in your house are going to be used to listen to you.
[01:43:41.363 --> 01:43:44.189]  If you came home today and pulled a book out of the bookshelf and there was a microphone there,
[01:43:44.941 --> 01:43:45.481]  You pulled it out.
[01:43:45.501 --> 01:43:46.242]  There was a wire.
[01:43:46.282 --> 01:43:47.562]  It went to a transmitter.
[01:43:47.782 --> 01:43:49.343]  You go, good Lord, honey, look at this!
[01:43:49.563 --> 01:43:50.203]  A microphone!
[01:43:50.243 --> 01:43:51.764]  I'm calling the police!
[01:43:52.104 --> 01:43:54.545]  But I get up here on the air and go, hey, I got links to mainstream news.
[01:43:54.565 --> 01:43:56.545]  They're listening to you right now.
[01:43:56.965 --> 01:43:58.726]  Oh, that guy's a chicken little.
[01:43:59.086 --> 01:44:00.267]  He's freaking out.
[01:44:00.507 --> 01:44:03.168]  Hey, I have all these major foreign papers, Mexican papers and U.S.
[01:44:03.188 --> 01:44:05.028]  papers, saying the North American Union's been set up.
[01:44:05.048 --> 01:44:06.069]  They're getting rid of our sovereignty.
[01:44:06.269 --> 01:44:08.510]  Texas business owners have been given North American business codes.
[01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:11.611]  Hey, listen, it's going to affect your... Shut up, you commie!
[01:44:12.948 --> 01:44:14.009]  You shut up!
[01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:15.290]  Turn my guns in!
[01:44:15.450 --> 01:44:17.312]  Turn your guns in, you liberal!
[01:44:17.792 --> 01:44:19.074]  Prove you're a conservative!
[01:44:19.274 --> 01:44:20.475]  Turn them all in!
[01:44:21.996 --> 01:44:22.617]  I like it!
[01:44:22.697 --> 01:44:23.978]  I like open borders!
[01:44:24.738 --> 01:44:25.219]  Liberal!
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.681]  I like Bush!
[01:44:28.342 --> 01:44:29.042]  Bratatongue!
[01:44:29.683 --> 01:44:32.285]  Got a little fired up there at the end.
[01:44:33.086 --> 01:44:33.706]  God bless you.
[01:44:33.846 --> 01:44:34.607]  See you back next week.
[01:44:34.647 --> 01:44:35.428]  Tell all your friends.
[01:44:35.608 --> 01:44:36.789]  More stations signing on.
[01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.870]  Syndication!
[01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:38.530]  I love it!
[01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:39.131]  God bless you!
[01:44:42.188 --> 01:44:42.588]  Stay tuned.
[01:44:42.608 --> 01:44:43.309]  Ted Anderson here.
[01:44:43.329 --> 01:44:50.474]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:44:50.734 --> 01:44:53.636]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[01:44:53.836 --> 01:44:59.480]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:02.242]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[01:45:04.184 --> 01:45:08.627]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:14.730]  Looking for profits?
[01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:16.191]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:45:16.532 --> 01:45:19.394]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:19.794 --> 01:45:27.041]  This low-vintage collector coin, with a total series vintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:30.984]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:45:31.184 --> 01:45:32.685]  Secure your position today.
