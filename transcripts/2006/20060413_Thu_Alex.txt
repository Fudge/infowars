[00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:06.252]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:07.953]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:09.794]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:11.275]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:12.895]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:17.198]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.758 --> 00:00:21.920]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:31.205]  We have a very important broadcast today.
[00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:44.175]  For you today, coming up in the next hour, David Bay of Cutting Edge Ministries has produced an incredible new film about the history of the Illuminati, the New World Order, the founding of America.
[00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:46.298]  We'll be joining us and we'll have open phones.
[00:00:47.777 --> 00:01:05.674]  In the meantime, a few things clicked last night concerning the staged, now going into week three, protest demonstrations, many riots that have been going on coast to coast, predominantly by the illegal alien lobby and illegal aliens themselves.
[00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.097]  So we'll get into some new developments there.
[00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:12.300]  I do want to take a lot of your calls in this first hour.
[00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:21.617]  The toll-free number to join us on any news item, any issue, any story, any question, any comment, 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:58.317]  And what clicked last night, one of the many things that clicked, is I knew that the Associated Press and others had reported what was already obvious, the Spanish-speaking media, TV, radio, print, in the United States, websites, you name it, had been unified, had been funded, had been pushed for at least two months before what we saw start three weeks ago.
[00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:05.466]  To go out and basically push for total blanket amnesty, total blanket open borders.
[00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:11.211]  And then last night, right before my TV show, I remembered.
[00:02:12.372 --> 00:02:28.024]  I remembered that in late 2005, in December, the President of Mexico hired George Bush's PR firm, the firm he uses out of Dallas, Texas, to craft a strategy with the U.S.
[00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:28.605]  media
[00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:38.660]  To block the American people's move to control our borders and defend our sovereignty from this invading force.
[00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:46.526]  And in front of me I have Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, several other news reports on it.
[00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:52.991]  Headline, Who'd Vicente Fox hire to stop us from building our border fence?
[00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:56.074]  Why George Bush's old PR hack, of course.
[00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:57.425]  L.A.
[00:02:57.465 --> 00:03:00.147]  Times headline, Fox hires lobbyists to sweeten U.S.
[00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:01.148]  views on immigration.
[00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:20.764]  We are seeing a foreign government, a foreign state, in tandem, in tandem, in unison, choreographing a move to destroy our sovereignty and to foil the grassroots wishes of the Constitutional
[00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:45.391]  uh... points that the American people have been demanding so we'll try to get an article out on this today this is hidden in plain view no one has picked up on this yet and I finally clicked to it last night so much of this is hidden in plain view but we get distracted by how much news and information there is all the different things uh... that are going on now
[00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:49.757]  We're going to be taking your calls, of course, as I mentioned.
[00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:53.119]  I'd like to specifically talk about this issue, but you're welcome to call in about whatever you'd like.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.182]  We'll also get into some of the new big developments concerning Iran.
[00:03:57.302 --> 00:03:59.723]  Iran vows not to back away from enrichment.
[00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:08.648]  Of course, two days ago they announced that they had successfully enriched uranium for their, quote, peaceful program of power.
[00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.931]  For nuclear power plants.
[00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:18.597]  And obviously they do want an A-bomb in the future because once you get one like North Korea or China or Pakistan, you are left alone.
[00:04:20.238 --> 00:04:26.563]  And continuing, Libby says Bush-Cheney did not authorize CIA agents' name leak.
[00:04:26.784 --> 00:04:30.947]  So now he's trying to go back on what he originally said.
[00:04:32.888 --> 00:04:36.151]  Also, well that's just some of what's coming up.
[00:04:37.563 --> 00:04:39.505]  We'll get into all of it today.
[00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:42.148]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.913]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:04:46.393 --> 00:04:47.314]  until 2 p.m.
[00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:49.897]  Central Standard Time.
[00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:55.023]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:57.186]  So stay with us.
[00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.132]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.413 --> 00:05:06.994]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.334 --> 00:05:11.998]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.338 --> 00:05:16.762]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.202 --> 00:05:21.385]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.606 --> 00:05:24.448]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.528 --> 00:05:27.050]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks...
[00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.796]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:41.263]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.503 --> 00:05:43.945]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:45.827]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.031]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.351 --> 00:06:07.133]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:11.556]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:12.817]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.137 --> 00:06:17.701]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:20.323]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:35.513]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.553 --> 00:06:42.618]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.360]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.842]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.122 --> 00:06:54.884]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:59.126]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:05.089]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:08.710]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.292]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:07:12.617 --> 00:07:15.839]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:21.362]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:07:21.382 --> 00:07:31.027]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:32.488]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:07:32.528 --> 00:07:37.931]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:07:38.431 --> 00:07:42.873]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:44.314]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:07:44.474 --> 00:07:49.136]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?
[00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:49.216]  1-877-928-8822
[00:08:02.463 --> 00:08:08.506]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:12.088]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.744 --> 00:08:29.826]  Alright, 8 minutes 30 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:31.527]  Well into the second segment, my friends.
[00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:33.829]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:35.530]  Wide open phones today, 800-259-9231.
[00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:41.254]  And David Bay of Cutting Edge Ministries produced a new incredible film.
[00:08:41.594 --> 00:08:43.375]  We'll be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:43.395 --> 00:08:45.096]  We'll have open phones for that as well.
[00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:47.337]  Concerning the good old New World Order.
[00:08:47.678 --> 00:08:50.860]  Alright, last segment I mentioned this, but now I will detail it more.
[00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:59.233]  Last night, I'm driving down to the TV station to do my local TV show, and I had one of those epiphanies, or it clicked.
[00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:05.778]  We know that the federal government, in tandem with the Mexican government, with U.S.
[00:09:05.818 --> 00:09:13.665]  corporations that predominantly own the Spanish media, for at least two months, hyped and prepared and scripted
[00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:25.554]  The last three weeks of demonstrations and I'd call it riot light that we have been witnessing by the illegal aliens and their lobby.
[00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:32.118]  And a lot of people ask, well, why don't Americans go out and counter-demonstrate this?
[00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:41.925]  Well, because the mainstream media is pacifying mainstream Americans, black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter, citizens of this country or people who are here illegally.
[00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:47.235]  They're saying, oh, the immigrants are loving, they're good, let's have unlimited, let's be reasonable.
[00:09:47.255 --> 00:10:04.468]  They're having lots of personalized human interest stories to make everybody feel good, and everything's alright, and oh look, the illegal aliens are wrapped in the American flag, and they don't call them illegal aliens, they call them migrants or immigrants, and oh, they're taking the jobs that nobody else wants.
[00:10:04.548 --> 00:10:05.469]  We know it's a script.
[00:10:06.335 --> 00:10:09.760]  Meanwhile, the Spanish media is saying this land is our land.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.943]  This is greater Mexico.
[00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:15.829]  This was stolen in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
[00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.714]  And you own the continent.
[00:10:19.854 --> 00:10:20.335]  Take it.
[00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:20.836]  Take it.
[00:10:20.896 --> 00:10:21.537]  It's yours.
[00:10:23.408 --> 00:10:32.352]  And so if CNN, if Fox, if ABC, if all these different news channels, cable channels, were saying get out there and demonstrate, get out and protest.
[00:10:32.412 --> 00:10:33.012]  No, no, no.
[00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:35.473]  They tell Americans don't demonstrate, don't protest.
[00:10:35.513 --> 00:10:36.774]  Demonstrators are bad.
[00:10:37.154 --> 00:10:38.494]  Demonstrators are stupid.
[00:10:38.534 --> 00:10:39.955]  Demonstrators are dangerous.
[00:10:40.135 --> 00:10:42.996]  Oh, the riot police have cornered the demonstrators.
[00:10:43.016 --> 00:10:44.997]  It doesn't matter if it's liberal or conservative.
[00:10:45.037 --> 00:10:49.919]  But suddenly when the millions of illegal aliens and their supporters pour out on the streets...
[00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.413]  And the different groups that support them and promote them, they're different PR firms.
[00:10:57.194 --> 00:10:58.735]  You don't see any of the riot police.
[00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:00.336]  You see nothing but positive spin.
[00:11:01.717 --> 00:11:08.722]  So we know, it's admitted, even the Associated Press has reported, that it was a PR campaign by, quote, Spanish media.
[00:11:08.742 --> 00:11:09.502]  But it's more than that.
[00:11:10.043 --> 00:11:19.129]  It is a PR campaign by a foreign power, a foreign government, against the United States.
[00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:22.556]  Against the American people.
[00:11:23.577 --> 00:11:25.318]  And we've got to get this story out.
[00:11:25.358 --> 00:11:27.419]  We've got to make it perfectly clear.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:43.671]  This is Mexico, in tandem with our own federal government, the Republican Party led by George W. Bush and the Democrats, in tandem, working together to counter the revolution that's been brewing, the hottest issue for years.
[00:11:44.813 --> 00:11:51.735]  For as long as I can remember, four or five years in talk radio, hasn't been the war on terror, hasn't been Iraq, hasn't been even the police state.
[00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:53.795]  It's been the illegal aliens.
[00:11:56.256 --> 00:11:57.736]  And so they're trying to counter this.
[00:11:57.756 --> 00:12:01.317]  They're trying to counter the move to build a border fence, to simply control our borders.
[00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:08.899]  To maybe deport a few of the 25 to 30 million illegals in this country.
[00:12:09.577 --> 00:12:15.138]  To maybe not let them get preferential treatment on housing loans or welfare or college tuition.
[00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:20.760]  Did you know in places like California and now Idaho and other states, they get more tuition than citizens?
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.160]  I mean, it's a red carpet.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:29.082]  American hospitals put ads in Mexican newspapers for years saying, come up here, get free health care, have your baby here.
[00:12:30.202 --> 00:12:32.123]  The anchor babies instantly becoming...
[00:12:32.899 --> 00:12:41.321]  Citizens at birth and the parents then getting their instant green cards basically by fiat become citizens and are hooked into the system.
[00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:43.601]  24% of the prison population in the Southwest.
[00:12:43.641 --> 00:12:44.341]  Illegal alien.
[00:12:45.561 --> 00:12:46.721]  A large portion of the crime.
[00:12:46.761 --> 00:12:47.362]  Illegal alien.
[00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:50.342]  A disproportionate amount of the auto accidents.
[00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:51.622]  Major national studies.
[00:12:51.962 --> 00:12:53.283]  Triple A study on this.
[00:12:54.183 --> 00:12:59.544]  But the illegal aliens are around 6-7% of the population if you use official numbers.
[00:12:59.604 --> 00:13:00.184]  It's really about 12%.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.544]  But at the same time, it's what, 20-something percent of the auto accidents.
[00:13:06.564 --> 00:13:07.946]  That just came out a few months.
[00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:08.726]  I forget the exact.
[00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:09.547]  It was 20-plus.
[00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:12.690]  I think 24 is what memory says, but don't quote me.
[00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.372]  Just put it in Google and find it for yourself.
[00:13:15.372 --> 00:13:17.274]  AAA, and there were several other news articles about it.
[00:13:17.614 --> 00:13:19.957]  There was a study out of Georgia where the number was even higher.
[00:13:19.997 --> 00:13:22.079]  I think it was, I've got a pretty good memory.
[00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:23.540]  I think it was 27, something like that.
[00:13:24.722 --> 00:13:28.604]  With the state study in Georgia, so even higher than what AAA said.
[00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:31.306]  Fox, but I digress, excuse me.
[00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:32.046]  You know I'm good at that.
[00:13:32.927 --> 00:13:35.028]  What we do know is the smoking gun.
[00:13:35.188 --> 00:13:42.952]  No one's pointed out, no one remembered, and I've dropped the ball for the last three weeks not remembering this, but here it is!
[00:13:43.212 --> 00:13:44.413]  I have it!
[00:13:45.974 --> 00:13:47.735]  I have the total proof here in my...
[00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.242]  My little hands.
[00:13:50.682 --> 00:13:53.824]  Fox hires lobbyists to sweeten U.S.
[00:13:53.904 --> 00:13:56.886]  views on immigration December 28, 2005.
[00:13:58.207 --> 00:14:05.632]  And this first broke on December 25 on Christmas Day in the Dallas Morning News.
[00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:16.299]  And of course, their headline, dig it out here, is President Fox hires Dallas firm lobbyists
[00:14:17.717 --> 00:14:25.267]  And then you read into the article, you learn that it is to, quote, stop anti-immigrant legislation that he calls, quote, abhorrent.
[00:14:25.288 --> 00:14:26.950]  But let me just read from the LA Times here.
[00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:28.350]  Mexico City.
[00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:38.797]  President Vicente Fox has rehired the Texas public relations man and GOP political consultant who quietly helped engineer his election victory in 2000.
[00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:42.280]  This time, Fox wants Rob Allen and co.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.344]  to put the brakes on growing anti-immigration, anti-Mexican sentiment in the United States.
[00:14:49.042 --> 00:14:49.982]  Last week, the U.S.
[00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:55.604]  House approved a bill to add 700 miles of border fencing and make illegal immigration a felony.
[00:14:55.904 --> 00:14:58.065]  You notice that just got shot down two days ago, by the way.
[00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:00.706]  Fox denounced the measure as shameful.
[00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:04.747]  His foreign minister called it stupid and underhanded.
[00:15:06.428 --> 00:15:07.568]  This, and it goes on.
[00:15:08.289 --> 00:15:11.970]  Contributions of Mexicans in the United States who are making their best efforts...
[00:15:12.737 --> 00:15:22.146]  Generating lots of wealth, and yes, sending two-thirds of it back to Mexico, are not known, said Rodrigo Ivan Cortez Jimenez.
[00:15:23.038 --> 00:15:28.201]  The elected deputy of Mexico's lower house and a member of its commission on foreign affairs.
[00:15:28.602 --> 00:15:38.328]  The immigration bill, expected to reach the Senate in February, and boy did it, and in April it's bye-bye, has no provision for allowing temporary Mexican workers.
[00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:43.812]  See, they're taking a bill that would have done something, and by the time they're done with it, it's a blanket amnesty plan.
[00:15:43.992 --> 00:15:50.656]  And that's what the PR firm wanted, George Bush's firm, the one he used, the one Fox uses, and now look what's happened.
[00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:58.812]  Now look what George Bush and Vicente Fox have done with the media they control, a totally staged event.
[00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:04.774]  And you're not going to hear that on the other neocon talk shows.
[00:16:04.814 --> 00:16:11.197]  They'll tell you how bad the open borders are, and then say their solution is George Bush's amnesty plan, which they say is an amnesty, which if you read the bill, it is.
[00:16:12.017 --> 00:16:17.358]  The bill expected to reach the Senate in February has no provision for allowing temporary Mexican workers a further slap.
[00:16:17.838 --> 00:16:21.659]  In Fox's view, he and President Bush agree on the need for a guest worker program.
[00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:23.199]  Total blanket amnesty.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.240]  An unlimited skilled and unskilled worker visas.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.340]  You think it's bad now?
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.421]  Oh, it'll end the border problem because we won't have a border.
[00:16:31.541 --> 00:16:36.262]  By the way, we have a local newscast clip where the lady's up there on TV going, we need a Pan-American union.
[00:16:36.822 --> 00:16:39.703]  In fact, perhaps one of my great staff who do such a wonderful job
[00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:41.956]  We're good to go.
[00:17:02.668 --> 00:17:09.451]  So the Mexican leader last week turned to the political operative who helped him topple Mexico's longtime ruling party to win the presidency.
[00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:14.413]  Rob Allen helped George Bush defeat Ann Richards for the governorship of Texas in 1994.
[00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:20.916]  Three years later, Allen saw another potential winner in Fox, then governor of one of the states of Mexico.
[00:17:20.976 --> 00:17:24.237]  He agreed to join Fox's presidential campaign, but only in secret.
[00:17:24.818 --> 00:17:28.519]  Well, it ain't secret now that you launched this in December.
[00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:30.360]  I totally forgot about it.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.381]  Since day one, we should have been out front on this.
[00:17:33.721 --> 00:17:35.221]  No one else has written about this.
[00:17:35.562 --> 00:17:36.922]  No one else has noticed this.
[00:17:37.162 --> 00:17:38.583]  This came out three months ago.
[00:17:42.084 --> 00:17:42.464]  And now...
[00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:47.864]  They've run it right in front of our face, a foreign government.
[00:17:47.905 --> 00:17:55.152]  They've run the PR campaign, the propaganda campaign, that's what it is, psychological warfare campaign, right in front of our face.
[00:17:55.392 --> 00:17:56.534]  This is what the headlines should be.
[00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:01.491]  Foreign government runs propaganda campaign in U.S.
[00:18:01.551 --> 00:18:04.633]  successfully defeats legislation.
[00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:07.334]  This is psychological warfare.
[00:18:07.614 --> 00:18:11.996]  This is a military attack on the United States.
[00:18:12.557 --> 00:18:20.881]  And I'm sure this will only encourage the lobbyists, two lobbyists for every member of Congress, over half of them foreign lobbyists, that already run our country.
[00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.442]  Now I guess they'll just start running...
[00:18:23.142 --> 00:18:26.263]  Multi-billion dollar Bush has done that with our tax money.
[00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:27.884]  Propaganda campaigns.
[00:18:27.924 --> 00:18:29.405]  And it's just over, folks.
[00:18:30.365 --> 00:18:32.666]  Unless people understand what's going on.
[00:18:34.567 --> 00:18:36.367]  So I'll get with Paul Watson or Steve Watson.
[00:18:36.387 --> 00:18:37.448]  Maybe one of them can write an article.
[00:18:37.488 --> 00:18:38.548]  I've got so much to do today.
[00:18:38.568 --> 00:18:40.789]  I'm trying to finish a new film we're working on.
[00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.090]  I've got a bunch of other stuff I'm trying to organize.
[00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.650]  And I want to spend a little bit of time with my family.
[00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:45.391]  I've been out of town.
[00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:47.411]  So I hope Paul's listening.
[00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:51.413]  I hope he'll get on it and write an article out of what I've said here today and do his own research.
[00:18:53.638 --> 00:18:57.720]  It just... It makes me tired, is what it does.
[00:19:01.802 --> 00:19:03.423]  It makes me very, very upset.
[00:19:06.504 --> 00:19:14.708]  And it says, Alan, who runs the propaganda firm called Dallas Morning News, he hid his work for Fox because he didn't want to be a political liability.
[00:19:14.768 --> 00:19:18.490]  Mexicans are sensitive to foreign interference, especially involving the United States.
[00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.251]  Oh, they absolutely hate us, on average.
[00:19:21.051 --> 00:19:22.592]  But they've been taught that for generations.
[00:19:23.923 --> 00:19:27.066]  And that is a large portion of the people in Mexico.
[00:19:27.386 --> 00:19:28.787]  Not Mexican-Americans.
[00:19:30.688 --> 00:19:34.631]  But though the propaganda is getting pretty effective, a lot of them are going to turn against the country, I guess.
[00:19:35.192 --> 00:19:36.673]  I mean, this is really bad.
[00:19:37.413 --> 00:19:43.018]  So see, they don't want foreign interference, but they'll run interference in this country with George Bush's PR boy.
[00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:44.879]  So there you have it.
[00:19:45.379 --> 00:19:47.701]  Foreign power overturns U.S.
[00:19:47.741 --> 00:19:48.622]  legislation.
[00:19:50.163 --> 00:19:51.604]  Just, we are humiliated.
[00:19:51.664 --> 00:19:52.605]  We are a joke.
[00:19:53.346 --> 00:19:57.908]  Mexico, Russia, China, they'd never put up with one one-hundredth of this.
[00:19:58.168 --> 00:19:58.788]  Literally.
[00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.850]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.152]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:20:07.532 --> 00:20:11.054]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:20:11.414 --> 00:20:14.976]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:20.238]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:20:20.558 --> 00:20:26.363]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:20:26.664 --> 00:20:32.809]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:38.915]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:20:39.335 --> 00:20:40.516]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:20:40.836 --> 00:20:41.956]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:20:42.036 --> 00:20:47.479]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:51.141]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.

[00:20:52.742 --> 00:20:53.022]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:20:53.042 --> 00:20:53.803]  Here it is, folks.
[00:20:53.823 --> 00:20:54.403]  The 2006 Red Book.
[00:20:54.423 --> 00:20:56.484]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:21:06.778 --> 00:21:10.419]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.

[00:21:42.845 --> 00:21:42.905]  1-800-686-2237
[00:22:01.161 --> 00:22:05.665]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:10.108]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:10.409 --> 00:22:10.949]  We listened.
[00:22:11.249 --> 00:22:16.234]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:16.514 --> 00:22:16.994]  We listened.
[00:22:17.395 --> 00:22:20.437]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:20.857 --> 00:22:21.378]  We listened.
[00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:25.900]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:26.761]  We listened.
[00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:32.343]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:32.764 --> 00:22:34.124]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:34.484 --> 00:22:41.868]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:42.248 --> 00:22:45.710]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:22:51.745 --> 00:22:52.686]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:54.167]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:59.764 --> 00:23:02.005]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[00:23:23.078 --> 00:23:26.621]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:30.123]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:23:30.383 --> 00:23:33.946]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:23:34.086 --> 00:23:37.569]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:38.970]  I'm really amazed.
[00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:44.954]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:23:45.094 --> 00:23:47.516]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:55.981]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:23:56.161 --> 00:23:58.162]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:24:03.706 --> 00:24:09.770]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.312]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.891]  So the headline, Fox hires lobbyists to sweeten U.S.
[00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:26.295]  views on immigration, to block the bill, to make illegal aliens felons, to block the bill, to build a border fence, and they've done it.
[00:24:26.315 --> 00:24:32.678]  They hired Bush's old PR firm he used in some of his elections, the firm that was secretly used to get Fox into office.
[00:24:32.698 --> 00:24:36.800]  He's a total stooge to the bankers in New York and London, and look what's happened.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.300]  They've done it.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.142]  And even I, for three weeks while this has been going on, didn't remember this.
[00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:42.702]  They do it right in front of us.
[00:24:42.742 --> 00:24:44.183]  They got mad when this went public.
[00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:45.822]  And we have them.
[00:24:45.862 --> 00:24:46.963]  We have the smoking gun.
[00:24:47.003 --> 00:24:49.545]  A foreign government manipulating our internal elections.
[00:24:49.986 --> 00:24:53.428]  Let's go to John in Ohio, then Jason, Rick, Tim, Steve, and others.
[00:24:53.468 --> 00:24:54.069]  Go ahead, John.
[00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.953]  Alex, I'll save my difference in emphasis on that issue for another time.
[00:24:59.013 --> 00:25:10.923]  I wanted to alert you to a media alert about a hatchet man for the Bush neocons' planned nuclear attack against Iran on a program I just heard.
[00:25:12.116 --> 00:25:22.542]  And this man goes even beyond Bush and the rabidness of his calls for attacking Iran, the disinformation, the lies, the rest of it, that even Bush wouldn't dare put.
[00:25:22.562 --> 00:25:28.206]  Yeah, they're now saying that they're going to have an A-bomb in 16 days and must be attacked now.
[00:25:28.686 --> 00:25:39.653]  Yes, and the host of this program is in total agreement with him, chummy with him, totally supports him, has him on months before and wants to have him on again, and that person is George Norrie.
[00:25:40.214 --> 00:25:57.383]  And I think that the soft, gentle voice really covers up a very dangerous position that Norrie has on this issue, and it completely contradicts and cancels out a lot of the good that's being done bringing out the conspiracy of the 9-11 attacks.
[00:25:57.443 --> 00:26:08.429]  If you just isolate that as an abstraction while you promote the PMAC objective and policies of this attack on 9-11, if you help galvanize, as PMAC says,
[00:26:09.011 --> 00:26:13.974]  There are plans to have this attack to justify attacks against Iran, Iraq and beyond.
[00:26:14.374 --> 00:26:18.676]  Well, then you're absolutely schizophrenic and I think it's really dangerous.
[00:26:18.756 --> 00:26:20.257]  I think something has to be...
[00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:38.813]  Well, now, in fairness to George Norrie, you've heard me on the show on a three-hour interview a few months ago saying I'm against attacking Iran and laying out the evidence, because I heard you call in, John.
[00:26:39.273 --> 00:26:45.475]  Yeah, but Norrie is the most rabid insider and promoter of this propaganda and lies for the attack against Iran.
[00:26:45.615 --> 00:26:52.358]  I wouldn't say he's the... I don't think it's fair to say he's the most rabid, but I have heard a few guests on there that have been saying that, and I appreciate your call, John.
[00:26:52.998 --> 00:26:54.098]  I will talk about Iran.
[00:26:54.138 --> 00:26:55.119]  In fact, that's up next.
[00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:58.260]  A bunch of new developments on that, as I mentioned in the first segment.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.300]  We will get into it.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.962]  And I'm totally against attacking Iran, and I agree with you that we shouldn't attack them, John.
[00:27:04.462 --> 00:27:05.983]  Let's talk to Jason in Maryland.
[00:27:06.043 --> 00:27:06.943]  Jason, you're on the air.
[00:27:07.823 --> 00:27:08.124]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:08.184 --> 00:27:08.864]  Thanks.
[00:27:09.224 --> 00:27:11.006]  I have a question and then a comment.
[00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:25.157]  I've been watching Lou Dobbs for about a week, and it seems as if he's not really lying, but he's telling half the truth, and I think that that's really a step up from everybody else I've seen.
[00:27:25.217 --> 00:27:27.339]  I was wondering what your opinion was on Lou Dobbs.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.401]  Well, I mean, he's better than most.
[00:27:30.822 --> 00:27:34.825]  So is the host of Countdown on MSNBC, but...
[00:27:35.639 --> 00:27:37.101]  So he's bought and paid for.
[00:27:53.266 --> 00:27:56.809]  Well, I mean, he is on CNN every single day and has one of their most popular shows.
[00:27:56.889 --> 00:28:01.572]  I personally like watching the guy and think he's one of the more believable people on there.
[00:28:02.033 --> 00:28:05.055]  But, you know, they've got to do that to have some type of audience.
[00:28:05.115 --> 00:28:06.996]  So, I mean, what do you think of Lou Dobbs?
[00:28:07.677 --> 00:28:13.101]  I think now that I listen to you that it's just the good cop, bad cop disinformation.
[00:28:14.542 --> 00:28:18.925]  Well, I would even say so much disinformation as it is just good cop, bad cop.
[00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:21.087]  Well, it's disinformation if the end...
[00:28:23.047 --> 00:28:24.148]  My second comment is
[00:28:49.853 --> 00:29:11.305]  If you would like to see, and perhaps you already know, I know that you're well-versed in Scripture, but if you would like to see the PNAC document in Scripture as the war with Iraq and then staging ground for Iran and Syria, that's in Ezekiel 38, specifically the war that's coming up.
[00:29:11.525 --> 00:29:12.666]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[00:29:12.706 --> 00:29:13.906]  We'll come back and talk to...
[00:29:15.891 --> 00:29:20.437]  Rick and Tim and Steve and many others, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:29:20.477 --> 00:29:26.343]  And what I'll do, people are already bringing up Iran, so I'll spend a few minutes on Iran.
[00:29:26.363 --> 00:29:27.184]  We'll go back to your calls.
[00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:30.869]  So on the other side, we'll get into Iran, some of the new developments there.
[00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:33.131]  And then we will...
[00:29:34.497 --> 00:29:35.417]  Take more of your calls.
[00:29:35.497 --> 00:29:37.658]  And then we've got David Bay, Cutting Edge Ministries, joining us.
[00:29:38.139 --> 00:29:42.040]  There's a lot of other police state news, Iraq news we'll get to as well.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.881]  Big broadcast today.
[00:29:44.461 --> 00:29:50.604]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and don't forget JonesReport.com, now updated daily.
[00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:52.525]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:54.605]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.546 --> 00:29:58.207]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.687 --> 00:30:02.327]  We're good to go.
[00:30:24.261 --> 00:30:24.902]  We're good to go.
[00:30:44.923 --> 00:30:45.984]  Or call 888-216-2461.
[00:30:46.004 --> 00:30:46.224]  That's 888-216-2461.
[00:31:01.684 --> 00:31:02.325]  We're good to go.
[00:31:22.645 --> 00:31:23.906]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:31:24.006 --> 00:31:29.890]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:35.174]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.294 --> 00:31:44.160]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.723]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:07.155]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:32:07.355 --> 00:32:09.717]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:32:09.937 --> 00:32:18.222]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta synthetic oil treatments, Protecta engine treatment, Protecta transmission treatment, and Protecta complete fuel system treatment.
[00:32:18.502 --> 00:32:26.245]  Protecta meets the demands you put on your vehicle by providing more horsepower, improving gas mileage, decreasing emissions, and promotes longer engine life.
[00:32:26.546 --> 00:32:33.349]  Only Protecta contains a new technology, Nano-B, which is not found in any competitive additive products at your local auto parts store.
[00:32:34.469 --> 00:32:35.970]  We do not compromise quality.
[00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:40.814]  Because you expect the very best, we provide products that work right the first time, every time.
[00:32:41.114 --> 00:32:43.556]  So get more when you treat it right with Protecta.

[00:32:53.483 --> 00:32:53.943]  Call now!
[00:33:02.222 --> 00:33:04.943]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:04.963 --> 00:33:08.905]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.191]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:26.772]  Monday through Friday.
[00:33:27.952 --> 00:33:28.312]  We're here.
[00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:29.713]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:31.889 --> 00:33:33.390]  Bloomberg News.
[00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:38.773]  Iran could produce a nuclear bomb in 16 days, says U.S.
[00:33:39.033 --> 00:33:41.334]  And we think, oh, U.S., that means us.
[00:33:41.414 --> 00:33:46.017]  No, that means the foreign banking entities that have had control of us since 1913.
[00:33:48.118 --> 00:33:56.603]  Iran, defying United Nations Security Council demands to halt its nuclear program, may be capable of making a nuclear bomb within 16 days, a U.S.
[00:33:56.643 --> 00:33:58.364]  State Department official said.
[00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:05.724]  The same people that constantly have been lying to us for years and planning false evidence and being caught doing it.
[00:34:05.924 --> 00:34:15.508]  Iran will move to industrial-scale uranium enrichment involving 54,000 centrifuges at its Natazn plant.
[00:34:15.868 --> 00:34:22.311]  The Associated Press quoted Deputy Nuclear Chief Mohammad Saeed as telling state-run television today.
[00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:29.695]  Using those 50,000 centrifuges, they could produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in 16 days.
[00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:32.496]  Stephen Rademaker, U.S.
[00:34:32.936 --> 00:34:38.579]  Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation, told reporters today in Moscow.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.262]  He also went on to say that reacting to a statement by Iranian President...
[00:34:44.193 --> 00:34:51.839]  Who said yesterday, the country has succeeded in enriching uranium on a small scale for the first time using 164 centrifuges.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:58.665]  That announcement defies demands by the UN Security Council that Iran shut down its nuclear program this month.
[00:34:59.045 --> 00:35:08.954]  The US fears Iran is pursuing a nuclear program to make weapons, while Iran says it is intent on purely civilian purposes to provide energy.
[00:35:09.654 --> 00:35:24.341]  Said 74,000 centrifuges will be able to enrich uranium to provide fuel for 1,000 megawatt nuclear power plants, similar to the Russian one that Russia is finishing in southern Iran, AP reported.
[00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:31.084]  It was a deeply disappointing announcement, Raidmaker said of the President's statement.
[00:35:31.784 --> 00:35:38.167]  Weapons-grade uranium, they continue, by saying the technology to enrich uranium...
[00:35:39.076 --> 00:35:48.822]  And saying that it would take a little over 13 year weapons with 164 centrifuges currently in use.
[00:35:49.283 --> 00:35:51.264]  So it would take 13 years to do that.
[00:35:51.424 --> 00:35:53.685]  My printer cut off part of the text, excuse me.
[00:35:54.746 --> 00:36:04.592]  But using the 50 plus thousand centrifuges, they can do that in, they're now reporting 16 days.
[00:36:06.562 --> 00:36:14.467]  With 3,000 of the machine cascade centrifuges, they're saying 271 days.
[00:36:14.848 --> 00:36:15.208]  All right.
[00:36:15.808 --> 00:36:17.269]  Enough of me babbling through that.
[00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:23.333]  The CIA's own threat assessment last year said it would take 10 years.
[00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:27.356]  Now, that would be 9 years for them...
[00:36:28.617 --> 00:36:37.682]  With the current centrifuges that they have purchased to produce one weapons grade A-bomb.
[00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:44.126]  And then, of course, once you have the material, you don't just put it together like a bologna or ham sandwich.
[00:36:44.668 --> 00:36:46.129]  But let's just stop right there.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.081]  Let's go back to history.
[00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:28.486]  Iran about a year and a half ago voluntarily agreed to freeze its admittedly peaceful programs.
[00:37:29.153 --> 00:37:32.454]  The United Nations had video cameras in every facility.
[00:37:32.934 --> 00:37:35.555]  They were given unfettered access anywhere they wished.
[00:37:35.615 --> 00:37:44.257]  They admitted that no country in history had given them total access and they were receiving total access from Iran.
[00:37:44.777 --> 00:37:52.079]  There was a moderate leader who had been elected there who was trying to be pro-West and was visiting the U.S.
[00:37:52.639 --> 00:37:56.100]  and other countries and was trying to be friendly towards Israel.
[00:37:57.159 --> 00:38:04.968]  And our government's response was to pressure the United Nations to lie to Iran and to claim that in one year they would allow them to go back to their peaceful process.
[00:38:05.509 --> 00:38:11.456]  One year later they refused, and look who got elected, but now the hard-line president.
[00:38:13.453 --> 00:38:14.573]  And then let's look at India.
[00:38:14.714 --> 00:38:15.914]  They've signed no treaties.
[00:38:16.014 --> 00:38:18.415]  They have at least 20 nuclear weapons.
[00:38:18.455 --> 00:38:23.137]  They have medium and long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[00:38:23.157 --> 00:38:27.658]  In 2002, they openly said that they were considering a nuclear strike on Pakistan.
[00:38:28.279 --> 00:38:33.501]  George Bush and Bill Clinton blocked the FBI from stopping Khan Laboratories in 1999, in 2000, in 2001, in 2002.
[00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:36.002]  W199I dealt with that as well, not just blocking the FBI from stopping
[00:38:42.424 --> 00:38:57.792]  Al-Qaeda operatives here in the United States, and our government, at least for four years, has been in full control of Pakistan, helped stage a coup there, what, in 2000 with Musharraf.
[00:38:57.972 --> 00:39:02.194]  So all of this is going on.
[00:39:03.214 --> 00:39:08.657]  Pakistan is reported to have at least six warheads and medium-range missiles.
[00:39:09.478 --> 00:39:10.298]  No one's concerned.
[00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:12.442]  No one's concerned about India.
[00:39:12.482 --> 00:39:20.228]  No one's concerned about North Korea threatening to nuke us in 1999, firing a dummy missile at the United States that actually hit Alaska, a test missile.
[00:39:20.248 --> 00:39:21.088]  That's mainstream news.
[00:39:21.128 --> 00:39:23.630]  But again, back of the paper, the average person never heard of that.
[00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:25.491]  All of this is going on.
[00:39:25.551 --> 00:39:34.017]  Meanwhile, Iran tried to engage in detente with us, tried to engage in diplomatic activities with us.
[00:39:34.318 --> 00:39:34.898]  It didn't work.
[00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:35.919]  So this is what happens.
[00:39:36.659 --> 00:39:38.801]  Either you go along with whatever the UN says...
[00:39:39.696 --> 00:39:50.541]  No matter what that is, give up your sovereignty, totally have your country controlled from without, or the bad cop, America comes and gets you if you don't submit to the good cop.
[00:39:52.402 --> 00:39:59.685]  And now they've accelerated the time frame saying, 16 days, they could have it, oh my gosh, they're about to nuke us any minute.
[00:39:59.725 --> 00:40:04.487]  And if a nuke goes off, if an A-bomb goes off, the number one suspect is not Iran.
[00:40:05.259 --> 00:40:08.101]  The number one suspect is the New World Order.
[00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:10.202]  And let's also look at it from this perspective.
[00:40:11.563 --> 00:40:16.486]  Our government admits, this has been in the news for two years, that U.S.
[00:40:16.506 --> 00:40:28.774]  Special Forces have parachuted, have been dropped in, all over Iran, and are routinely supplied in the mountains, overseeing facilities.
[00:40:29.194 --> 00:40:31.596]  They are admittedly lazing and marking locations
[00:40:32.313 --> 00:40:37.098]  Targets for laser-guided bombs and GPS-guided munitions.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.605]  They have been openly caught carrying out terror attacks in Iran.
[00:40:44.366 --> 00:40:54.957]  Two and a half years ago, after Iraq had been somewhat secured, the CIA tried to stage riots nationwide and then even bragged about it and almost overturned the government.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.505]  And our government is openly saying they may strike them anytime.
[00:41:00.645 --> 00:41:03.249]  Israel has purchased over 500 bunker busters.
[00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:07.014]  Over 200 nuclear bunker busters have been built by the U.S.
[00:41:07.054 --> 00:41:08.236]  government the last two years.
[00:41:08.557 --> 00:41:10.139]  They have been shipped to the region.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.983]  They are in airfields right now in Europe.
[00:41:13.627 --> 00:41:16.248]  Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel.
[00:41:16.848 --> 00:41:18.168]  They are on aircraft carriers.
[00:41:18.208 --> 00:41:19.789]  They have been loaded on submarines.
[00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:21.809]  They're openly saying they may attack them any minute.
[00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:28.752]  And Iran responds by saying Israel should be wiped off the map.
[00:41:29.052 --> 00:41:30.852]  Not that they're going to wipe them off the map.
[00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:35.354]  While Israel is saying their administration should be wiped off the map.
[00:41:37.654 --> 00:41:40.455]  Cheney and Bolton, an envoy to the U.N.
[00:41:40.515 --> 00:41:42.336]  from the State Department, head U.N.
[00:41:42.396 --> 00:41:43.236]  envoy from the U.S.,
[00:41:44.011 --> 00:41:47.193]  Says that we're going to cause them great pain and great suffering.
[00:41:47.813 --> 00:41:50.014]  The president of Iran repeats that back.
[00:41:50.154 --> 00:41:52.035]  Our media ignores that it's a repeat.
[00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:53.676]  They cut out of context.
[00:41:53.696 --> 00:41:56.317]  He said, you threaten to cause us great harm and pain.
[00:41:56.697 --> 00:42:03.501]  If you do cause us great harm and pain, we will cause you great harm, pain, and then the full quote was, suffering.
[00:42:04.201 --> 00:42:07.943]  And then we just simply hear, oh, he's threatening us with great harm, pain, and suffering.
[00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:14.859]  When he just simply said, if you cause us great harm, pain, and suffering, we have the capability to cause you great harm, pain, and suffering.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:21.908]  So see, in that context, it doesn't sound as reasonable to attack Iran.
[00:42:23.157 --> 00:42:39.221]  What's happening with a lot of talk show hosts and people out there is that they know where this is going, and they know it's going to be very popular once the war starts, though it'll just be for a few months, because any time America's in a war, people who even normally think in a sane fashion suddenly get swept up by the mass mind control.
[00:42:40.841 --> 00:42:44.182]  And that's exactly what's happening with this peer pressure right now.
[00:42:45.382 --> 00:42:47.003]  And it's just horrible.
[00:42:47.963 --> 00:42:48.543]  It's horrible.
[00:42:49.511 --> 00:42:53.073]  The globalists want the trillions of dollars of oil that's in that country.
[00:42:53.113 --> 00:42:57.956]  They will have Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan right up against the border of China.
[00:42:57.996 --> 00:43:05.140]  This is admitted in their own PNAC policy papers, Israeli policy war plans, Brzezinski's public war plans.
[00:43:05.641 --> 00:43:07.902]  This has been the war plan all along.
[00:43:08.983 --> 00:43:11.624]  And they're just marching forward with a PNAC plan.
[00:43:12.345 --> 00:43:17.408]  And I believe it will be preceded or will be followed by a major...
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:27.769]  Terror attack on the order of 9-11 at least, or perhaps even larger, in Europe, in the UK, or somewhere in the North American Union.
[00:43:27.789 --> 00:43:28.709]  That's what they already call it.
[00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:32.193]  Canada, Mexico, and the US are already in the North American Union.
[00:43:33.514 --> 00:43:36.176]  And it's very, very serious.
[00:43:36.777 --> 00:43:41.221]  What we face is very, very serious right now.
[00:43:42.402 --> 00:43:42.522]  And...
[00:43:45.828 --> 00:43:48.989]  Our country is being overthrown by foreign interest.
[00:43:49.509 --> 00:43:58.372]  Our roads, our ports, our water districts, our water plants, our power plants are already more than 50% owned by foreign companies.
[00:43:58.812 --> 00:44:08.975]  Vicente Fox openly hires Bush's Republican operative PR firm to stage these rallies and protests in media, both on English and Spanish speaking.
[00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:10.295]  We are a joke.
[00:44:11.198 --> 00:44:12.199]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:44:12.659 --> 00:44:21.044]  The people claiming they're doing all this for our, quote, national sovereignty are the very people destroying our national sovereignty.
[00:44:21.444 --> 00:44:26.467]  And there's this primitive, bloodlust hatred of anybody different, anybody overseas.
[00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:29.168]  When the government tells you to hate them, people get angry.
[00:44:29.468 --> 00:44:34.611]  But when real-life foreigners are overthrowing our sovereignty, people lay back and take it.
[00:44:36.592 --> 00:44:37.773]  Let's go to Rick in Ohio.
[00:44:37.793 --> 00:44:38.654]  You're on the air, Rick.
[00:44:38.994 --> 00:44:39.554]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:39.614 --> 00:44:40.215]  First-time caller.
[00:44:40.235 --> 00:44:40.455]  Welcome.
[00:44:40.635 --> 00:44:40.935]  Welcome.
[00:44:41.824 --> 00:44:42.224]  Thank you.
[00:44:42.364 --> 00:44:47.887]  I want to thank you first off for helping me open up my eyes and my ears to what really is going on.
[00:44:47.907 --> 00:44:58.292]  I want to encourage the people to buy the videos and the books and support the sponsors of this program because we really have to get into the fight here and get off our butts.
[00:44:58.332 --> 00:44:59.433]  Listening is not enough.
[00:44:59.473 --> 00:45:00.794]  We must get involved.
[00:45:01.794 --> 00:45:09.658]  I know it seems like you have a lot of pressure on you, but the people, we can help ease that pressure just by getting the information out.
[00:45:10.723 --> 00:45:13.284]  Well, I appreciate the support.
[00:45:13.424 --> 00:45:19.207]  And we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, the listeners, that have supported us and supported our affiliates and our sponsors.
[00:45:19.247 --> 00:45:19.768]  So thank you.
[00:45:20.048 --> 00:45:20.988]  Well, I'm thankful, too.
[00:45:21.329 --> 00:45:21.969]  Thankful to you.
[00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:23.950]  A question that I had today.
[00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:31.314]  First off, I heard on a program earlier today that Special Forces are already doing black ops in Iran right now.
[00:45:32.554 --> 00:45:35.656]  Listen, two and a half years ago, Special Forces were put in.
[00:45:36.276 --> 00:45:37.337]  They had been built up.
[00:45:38.192 --> 00:45:52.241]  And imagine if foreign troops were in America, and they've been caught, there's been a bunch of bombings, there's a bombing every few weeks over there, and missiles hitting dams, and they're doing everything they can to get Iran to do something stupid.
[00:45:52.641 --> 00:46:01.327]  I got a suspicion that they're just already started the invasion over there, and that they're just not going to tell us about it until they can get us behind them.
[00:46:02.003 --> 00:46:04.484]  Well, I agree with you and I appreciate your call.
[00:46:04.924 --> 00:46:08.166]  Let me just add that I don't believe it's going to be a full-scale invasion.
[00:46:09.527 --> 00:46:13.348]  I don't believe it's going to be a complete overthrow of the country.
[00:46:13.388 --> 00:46:14.389]  This is what they're going to do.
[00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:18.771]  214 sites, and it'll probably be more than that.
[00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:29.175]  The infrastructure of the country, it's not just going to be hitting their laboratories, their engineering facilities for nuclear power or atomic weapons.
[00:46:29.615 --> 00:46:30.635]  Let's not fool ourselves.
[00:46:30.836 --> 00:46:36.979]  Sure, they're trying to get an A-bomb, but not to use it on anybody.
[00:46:37.019 --> 00:46:37.879]  That would be suicide.
[00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:44.042]  To engage in nuclear blackmail or mutually assured destruction, mad, that's actually held us in good stead.
[00:46:44.822 --> 00:46:45.163]  Okay?
[00:46:46.583 --> 00:46:47.684]  So, but the
[00:46:48.837 --> 00:46:50.058]  We're talking years and years.
[00:46:50.498 --> 00:46:54.161]  The liberal estimates by the neocons are three years.
[00:46:54.221 --> 00:46:55.542]  That's the real estimates, okay?
[00:46:55.822 --> 00:46:57.083]  It was four years, now it's three years.
[00:46:57.723 --> 00:47:01.466]  The more moderate estimates by the CIA are nine years.
[00:47:02.527 --> 00:47:02.887]  Okay?
[00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:04.328]  Nine years.
[00:47:04.348 --> 00:47:05.088]  It was ten.
[00:47:05.148 --> 00:47:06.049]  Now a year's gone by.
[00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:09.151]  Please, because I get emails going, you said ten.
[00:47:09.191 --> 00:47:10.432]  Well, now it's nine, folks.
[00:47:11.493 --> 00:47:14.695]  Regardless, this is what I see happening.
[00:47:15.825 --> 00:47:34.781]  A little under half, I said half last week, I looked it up, I'm wrong, about 45% of Iran's discovered extractable crude oil and light crude and sweet crude reserves are in a small region right up against the border with Iraq.
[00:47:34.821 --> 00:47:37.083]  Just wonderful, easy pickings.
[00:47:38.664 --> 00:47:59.382]  And so special forces will engage, not just in picking targets and in target intelligence, but they are also in Iran to carry out destabilization attacks, as were carried out in 1953, and as were carried out, admittedly, two and a half years ago when they tried to overthrow the country.
[00:47:59.422 --> 00:47:59.702]  Remember that?
[00:47:59.722 --> 00:48:02.545]  It was in the news a few days ago, riots and bombings nationwide.
[00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:10.873]  And then to also be the vanguard for intelligence in the western area of Iran, and that U.S.
[00:48:10.933 --> 00:48:13.995]  forces and British forces will pour into that area.
[00:48:14.015 --> 00:48:15.996]  And they're now admitting they plan to do this, by the way.
[00:48:16.016 --> 00:48:17.257]  This is in the battle plans.
[00:48:17.944 --> 00:48:19.866]  To, quote, secure not the oil.
[00:48:19.906 --> 00:48:21.448]  Of course, they don't want that oil.
[00:48:21.468 --> 00:48:24.471]  It just so happens that that's where the oil's at.
[00:48:25.072 --> 00:48:35.323]  It's a, quote, buffer to stop Iran from sending its, quote, IED, improvised explosive device terrorist, over the border into Iraq.
[00:48:37.999 --> 00:48:39.279]  So that's the story.
[00:48:39.359 --> 00:48:50.102]  And then if special forces and operatives and spies in the country, and the old SAVAK operatives that are still there, are able to overthrow Iran, so much the better.
[00:48:50.542 --> 00:48:59.704]  But that will be a coup d'etat type overthrow, similar to what we saw with Oslo and Milajevic in 2000, or similar to what we saw with Mosaddegh and Iran in 1953.
[00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.390]  Hey, Alex.
[00:49:01.411 --> 00:49:01.491]  Hi.
[00:49:22.185 --> 00:49:27.468]  Hey, I got a couple of questions for you and a comment about the whole immigrant thing.
[00:49:27.788 --> 00:49:28.108]  Okay.
[00:49:28.188 --> 00:49:31.630]  I'll start with the immigrant thing since that was the first thing we were talking about.
[00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:39.254]  The illegal alien thing, the people protesting, demanding that they be allowed to have no insurance and get all free welfare and run all over us.
[00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:40.514]  Absolutely.
[00:49:40.534 --> 00:49:42.155]  Wrapped in foreign flags.
[00:49:42.916 --> 00:49:51.560]  It appears to me that it's so obvious that what it is is as we outsource jobs, we need to insource these people
[00:49:52.119 --> 00:49:56.640]  And it's just another step in eliminating American middle class.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:03.462]  And more than that, the point we need to add to the story we're going to write this afternoon is that this is globalization.
[00:50:03.782 --> 00:50:05.182]  This is their Pan-American Union.
[00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:09.243]  If they can't get it by hook, they'll get it by crook.
[00:50:11.704 --> 00:50:20.946]  So the other thing I wanted to ask you about was I got an interesting clip played to me a few days back by a guy named Rick Wiles.
[00:50:21.832 --> 00:50:22.092]  Yes.
[00:50:22.692 --> 00:50:23.893]  You familiar with Rick Wild?
[00:50:23.933 --> 00:50:24.473]  Sure, yeah.
[00:50:25.153 --> 00:50:27.413]  I don't know what his credibility is or anything.
[00:50:27.433 --> 00:50:34.415]  It was brand new to me, but it was about the power outage at the Capitol building last week.
[00:50:35.815 --> 00:50:41.617]  Yeah, and then now a lot of people are saying, was that an excuse for somebody to put something in there?
[00:50:42.237 --> 00:50:42.477]  Right.
[00:50:43.234 --> 00:50:43.994]  Who knows, sir?
[00:50:44.334 --> 00:50:44.795]  Who knows?
[00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:49.597]  I really don't have any comment on that particular individual you named.
[00:50:50.077 --> 00:50:51.077]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:50:51.257 --> 00:50:51.797]  Anything else?
[00:50:52.998 --> 00:50:54.078]  No, hey, keep up the good work.
[00:50:54.098 --> 00:50:54.999]  I appreciate it, man.
[00:50:55.299 --> 00:50:56.559]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:56.619 --> 00:50:57.019]  Thank you.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:58.440]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:05.963]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.123 --> 00:51:10.585]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.685 --> 00:51:11.225]  There is a
[00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:15.083]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:15.163 --> 00:51:17.986]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.246 --> 00:51:22.471]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.531 --> 00:51:29.458]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.598 --> 00:51:31.600]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:42.308]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:56:13.343 --> 00:56:13.763]  How are you?
[00:56:13.984 --> 00:56:14.224]  Good, sir.
[00:56:14.264 --> 00:56:16.786]  I have to give a shout-out to Charlie Sheen.
[00:56:16.846 --> 00:56:21.489]  I had a chance to meet him in 1995 when I was sleeping on the beach in L.A.
[00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:29.595]  My question is concerning this audio that's been circulating all over the Internet.
[00:56:29.715 --> 00:56:32.096]  The guy, previous caller, mentioned it.
[00:56:32.217 --> 00:56:34.958]  Have you heard this audio from True News?
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.462]  I mean, what, a report about how the power went off?
[00:56:40.262 --> 00:56:41.103]  Have you heard the audio?
[00:56:41.123 --> 00:56:41.163]  No.
[00:56:42.403 --> 00:56:43.244]  Well, tell me what it is.
[00:56:44.546 --> 00:56:45.227]  Well, you can get it.
[00:56:45.307 --> 00:56:50.395]  I've sent it to you and I'm sure if I've sent it to you, millions of other people have sent it to you.
[00:56:50.875 --> 00:56:51.837]  Listen to the audio.
[00:56:51.877 --> 00:56:52.978]  I think it's significant.
[00:56:53.339 --> 00:56:54.781]  Okay, well tell us what the audio is.
[00:56:55.422 --> 00:56:57.906]  The audio talks about how
[00:56:59.795 --> 00:57:01.676]  He got a call from a friend.
[00:57:01.696 --> 00:57:02.576]  Oh, yeah.
[00:57:03.136 --> 00:57:03.336]  Right.
[00:57:03.376 --> 00:57:06.998]  Well, I mean, I'm fully aware that this could be a hoax.
[00:57:07.178 --> 00:57:07.638]  I don't know.
[00:57:08.578 --> 00:57:09.979]  Frankly, people sent it to me.
[00:57:09.999 --> 00:57:12.239]  I opened it up and started listening and didn't even continue.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.520]  Wow, really?
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.601]  Yeah, I'm not going to... Thanks for the call.
[00:57:15.741 --> 00:57:18.282]  Look, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.
[00:57:18.822 --> 00:57:19.962]  Call or ask me what I thought.
[00:57:20.042 --> 00:57:20.983]  I just said no comment.
[00:57:21.783 --> 00:57:22.123]  Okay?
[00:57:22.183 --> 00:57:24.384]  I mean, we've seen a lot of this stuff.
[00:57:24.824 --> 00:57:27.505]  I got a call or he heard or this is going on and I just...
[00:57:28.061 --> 00:57:32.946]  That's not what I do here, and so, you know, whatever.
[00:57:32.966 --> 00:57:38.292]  I mean, I've answered your question, and I just, you know.
[00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:40.515]  I'll look into it some more if you'd like, sir.
[00:57:40.535 --> 00:57:48.804]  I mean, when you see unconfirmed stuff over and over again from the same sources...
[00:57:50.027 --> 00:57:56.529]  Or somebody's family member has a vision of a nuke going off or stuff like that.
[00:57:56.609 --> 00:57:57.369]  I've heard in the past.
[00:57:57.429 --> 00:57:58.549]  I mean, that's just not my show.
[00:58:00.329 --> 00:58:00.650]  Great.
[00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:04.470]  I mean, if people like that, they can enjoy themselves.
[00:58:05.491 --> 00:58:05.771]  Great.
[00:58:06.231 --> 00:58:08.211]  It's just that's not what I do on my show.
[00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:13.213]  And I cover the news and information that we have in front of us.
[00:58:14.213 --> 00:58:15.193]  Could the federal government...
[00:58:15.919 --> 00:58:16.599]  Attack itself?
[00:58:16.639 --> 00:58:18.200]  Could the federal government attack the Capitol?
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.020]  Could something like that happen?
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.040]  Absolutely.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:26.501]  You know, a few months ago, there were people putting out reports, somebody else, about how Texas City would be nuked.
[00:58:27.722 --> 00:58:31.982]  And then I looked at the sources where it was coming from, and it just was ridiculous.
[00:58:32.022 --> 00:58:37.164]  And people got mad at me that I wouldn't go off the deep end and say that Texas City was going to be nuked.
[00:58:37.204 --> 00:58:39.024]  I mean, you got the wrong show.
[00:58:41.667 --> 00:58:45.909]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.949 --> 00:58:46.369]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.529 --> 00:58:47.129]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:50.710]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.091 --> 00:58:55.232]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.512 --> 00:58:56.993]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.766 --> 00:59:09.388]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.968 --> 00:59:14.070]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.871 --> 00:59:20.053]  Now into hour number two.
[00:59:21.294 --> 00:59:22.814]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:22.834 --> 00:59:26.896]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:59:27.016 --> 00:59:28.297]  Already into hour number two.
[00:59:28.397 --> 00:59:30.198]  David Bay of Cutting Edge Ministries.
[00:59:31.021 --> 00:59:32.222]  David, you're on the air.
[00:59:32.242 --> 00:59:33.002]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:59:33.022 --> 00:59:33.302]  Malta, Illinois.
[00:59:33.322 --> 00:59:33.602]  Welcome, sir.
[00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.688]  You're a true American hero and patriot, Alex.
[01:00:02.748 --> 01:00:03.548]  I'll try my best.
[01:00:03.588 --> 01:00:04.889]  I'm just trying to live in a free country.
[01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:05.949]  No, we appreciate it.
[01:00:05.989 --> 01:00:06.309]  Thank you.
[01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:10.691]  I don't know if you're aware of it, but you've been coming up an awful lot on the Michael Medved Show.
[01:00:11.791 --> 01:00:14.473]  Yeah, I mean, I know over the years he savages me routinely.
[01:00:15.173 --> 01:00:16.413]  Yeah, he's getting worse, too.
[01:00:16.653 --> 01:00:23.916]  I mean, this is the guy who called Howard Stern an extremely intelligent and talented person, and he has the nerve to cut you down like he does.
[01:00:24.796 --> 01:00:28.958]  And I know why, because he's a neocon shill, and a lot of people are starting to realize that now.
[01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:32.411]  He dismisses Building 7.
[01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:34.473]  I sent you a tape a year ago about that.
[01:00:34.913 --> 01:00:44.502]  However, yesterday he said there was absolutely no proof that Neil Bush ran security on the Trade Centers and got really irate with the guy and cut him off.
[01:00:44.902 --> 01:00:46.343]  I believe that's the Associated Press.
[01:00:46.703 --> 01:00:47.784]  That's mainstream news.
[01:00:48.485 --> 01:00:49.005]  Yeah, I know.
[01:00:49.106 --> 01:00:50.987]  I know everything you source is mainstream news.
[01:00:51.187 --> 01:00:57.593]  And then he also said that he won't let you on his show, but he expects you to let him on your show.
[01:00:58.942 --> 01:01:00.443]  Which I thought was kind of ridiculous.
[01:01:01.723 --> 01:01:06.185]  He said that about a year ago, and I called his producer up and said, any time, and never got a call back.
[01:01:06.846 --> 01:01:08.686]  Yeah, I wouldn't think he'd want to go on your show.
[01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:10.327]  I mean, they're afraid of you, it's obvious.
[01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.729]  I actually heard him say the FBI should arrest you.
[01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:17.070]  I mean, this guy is just out of control.
[01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:17.871]  Yeah, I've heard that.
[01:01:17.911 --> 01:01:18.791]  I've heard the type of that.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:19.800]  Yeah.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.663]  Yeah, I got national talk show hosts calling for my arrest.
[01:01:22.963 --> 01:01:24.424]  Yeah, that's just beyond belief.
[01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.266]  Yeah, no, they're afraid.
[01:01:26.686 --> 01:01:29.208]  They better be, because I'm going to try to defend this country and my family.
[01:01:29.608 --> 01:01:30.129]  Exactly.
[01:01:30.389 --> 01:01:32.331]  And I think you've got a lot of people on your side now.
[01:01:33.432 --> 01:01:40.317]  And that's basically all I really had to say, except if you could give us an update on the Rodriguez thing and...
[01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:43.210]  With Hugo Chavez.
[01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:45.011]  I'm told they met with him.
[01:01:45.031 --> 01:01:46.391]  They did not go on the TV show.
[01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:49.912]  I think they're now down in Chile.
[01:01:50.112 --> 01:01:51.012]  So they're out of pocket.
[01:01:51.032 --> 01:01:54.033]  I've been trying to get a hold of them, and we're going to try to get them back up for an update.
[01:01:54.053 --> 01:01:55.114]  Thanks for reminding me.
[01:01:55.434 --> 01:01:56.174]  I've been out of town.
[01:01:56.194 --> 01:01:59.395]  I tried to call them last week, but I left town.
[01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.535]  I'm going to try to get a hold of them today.
[01:02:01.775 --> 01:02:08.137]  Do you know if you ever got that cassette I sent you nearly a year ago about the Silverstein question that went on the Medved show?
[01:02:09.618 --> 01:02:10.758]  I think I missed that.
[01:02:11.454 --> 01:02:16.557]  Yeah, I sent it in a... Yeah, I did, but I did get a lot of the clips and stuff.
[01:02:16.577 --> 01:02:21.239]  People sent me online of him just saying that I should be arrested and stuff like that.
[01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:22.340]  Oh, okay, yeah.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.761]  All right, that's basically it, Alex.
[01:02:24.801 --> 01:02:25.762]  Keep up the great work.
[01:02:25.922 --> 01:02:27.663]  I mean, is he still saying I should be arrested?
[01:02:28.263 --> 01:02:33.185]  No, I heard him say that maybe several months ago at least.
[01:02:33.386 --> 01:02:34.646]  What was the context of that?
[01:02:35.307 --> 01:02:39.709]  They were talking about somebody else that got arrested, and I wish I remembered who he was talking about.
[01:02:39.749 --> 01:02:39.829]  It's...
[01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:45.220]  Oh, so he was strawmanning me, mixing me into someone else.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.362]  Yeah, something like that, yeah.
[01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:51.667]  Yeah, they have a little handbook in their heads of dirty tricks.
[01:02:51.707 --> 01:02:52.628]  It doesn't work anymore.
[01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.349]  People know exactly who they are.
[01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:55.971]  Yep, you got that right.
[01:02:57.212 --> 01:02:58.353]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:58.894 --> 01:03:02.818]  You know, I get hit by the big national publications, the big national talk show host.
[01:03:03.487 --> 01:03:04.508]  I mean, we're going all the way.
[01:03:23.368 --> 01:03:31.131]  Pointing over the turn, we're not stopping, and none of the intimidation, none of the threats, which I rarely even talk about, they've been voluminous, affect me.
[01:03:31.151 --> 01:03:45.778]  In fact, whenever I'm tired and don't want to put in an extra five hours of work, I just tune in and hear these people lying to the American people, trying to destroy my country, my future, my family's future, your children's future, and their threats, and it just energizes me.
[01:03:45.878 --> 01:03:49.539]  So, we know we're over the target when we're getting the flag.
[01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:50.580]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.100]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.545 --> 01:03:57.408]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.648 --> 01:03:59.230]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:04.254]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.595 --> 01:04:08.999]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.439 --> 01:04:13.644]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.844 --> 01:04:16.686]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.787 --> 01:04:19.269]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:04:19.469 --> 01:04:21.411]  But the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.631 --> 01:04:26.034]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.274 --> 01:04:33.500]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.182]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.342 --> 01:04:38.063]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.371]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:58.393]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:23.311 --> 01:05:35.741]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[01:05:35.961 --> 01:05:42.526]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:16.510]  We're good to go.
[01:06:35.126 --> 01:06:36.987]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.738]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.338 --> 01:06:59.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.782 --> 01:07:04.424]  All right, David Bay is scheduled.
[01:07:04.444 --> 01:07:15.513]  There's some phone number stuff going on, so while we figure out what's happening with that and his powerful film, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, The New Atlantis, let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:07:15.533 --> 01:07:16.834]  We've been talking about the open borders.
[01:07:16.854 --> 01:07:30.206]  We've been talking about Vicente Fox hiring George Bush's PR firm out of Dallas to stage all these demonstrations with the media, our government, the American media, the Spanish media, all working in tandem together.
[01:07:31.827 --> 01:07:32.268]  We're good to go.
[01:07:32.308 --> 01:07:32.448]  I think?
[01:07:55.074 --> 01:08:03.485]  To overturn the legislation that had already passed the House, went to the Senate, got watered down, now going back to the House, and Hastert just gutted it yesterday.
[01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:10.354]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Chris in Florida, then Angela, Keith, and others.
[01:08:10.394 --> 01:08:11.416]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:08:12.449 --> 01:08:18.472]  Alex, I know you've talked about vitamin C before, and I don't know if you've heard about intravenous vitamin C that's very effective.
[01:08:19.093 --> 01:08:20.373]  Yeah, I covered that two weeks ago.
[01:08:20.393 --> 01:08:41.205]  They just had two big Canadian official medical studies showing that it was actually making cancer shrivel up and disappear in different organs, and it's totally conclusive and just mirroring the studies that Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling engaged in in the mid-1970s.
[01:08:42.581 --> 01:08:48.682]  Which they try to ignore, and the Harvard School of Medicine just backed them up a few months ago, too, with cancer.
[01:08:48.722 --> 01:08:52.923]  But vitamin C is also great for viral and bacterial diseases.
[01:08:53.883 --> 01:09:02.944]  If anybody wants to find an alternative doctor in their area, there's a great website called icimed.com, and that's a great resource.
[01:09:03.004 --> 01:09:03.805]  Lots of doctors there.
[01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:09.806]  I wanted to ask you about Iran, some of the issues that I know I've seen on your website.
[01:09:09.826 --> 01:09:11.806]  I don't remember having heard you mention it.
[01:09:12.225 --> 01:09:19.207]  Like the UK shipping over the zirconium silicate and the weapons-grade metal beryllium, of course, is on your website.
[01:09:19.867 --> 01:09:28.909]  A few months ago, the zirconium silicate from the UK, that's used for only preventing corrosion of the fuel rods for their nuclear reactors.
[01:09:29.369 --> 01:09:30.489]  So it has no other use.
[01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:37.271]  And the fact that you brought up AQ Khan, I haven't heard you mention Ruud Lubbers, the former Dutch Prime Minister.
[01:09:38.651 --> 01:09:39.291]  He said that
[01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:42.980]  Back in the 70s, we knew that A.Q.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:47.222]  Khan was trying to spread around his nuclear plans.
[01:09:47.242 --> 01:09:54.104]  He had been caught copying nuclear blueprints twice, and our CIA convinced the Dutch to not prosecute him.
[01:09:54.164 --> 01:09:55.245]  That's right.
[01:09:55.505 --> 01:09:59.686]  We have covered that, and we've covered how England has helped arm Iran.
[01:09:59.706 --> 01:10:04.288]  But then, again, it's all just in a vacuum.
[01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.676]  But they have an arms embargo, and what's the deal with that?
[01:10:07.796 --> 01:10:09.117]  It's just crazy.
[01:10:09.857 --> 01:10:18.722]  With AQ Khan, the fact that we're supposed to be following him since the 70s, and Rude Luber says that we were told about him and we knew about him.
[01:10:19.483 --> 01:10:24.286]  Meanwhile, he's spreading around all his nuclear plans and materials amongst the various countries.
[01:10:24.986 --> 01:10:26.707]  And then George Tenet comes out in 2001.
[01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:33.287]  Well, we don't need to believe either one of them, because we know the Dutch are telling the truth, because Bush signed W1999.
[01:10:50.254 --> 01:11:01.617]  Among other things, telling the FBI to back off Hamas, back off Al-Qaeda, back off the Bin Ladens, ABL, but also to back off AQ Khan and Khan Laboratories.
[01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:02.298]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:03.338 --> 01:11:03.758]  All right.
[01:11:04.238 --> 01:11:13.921]  Our guest is with us, and we're carrying his amazing new film that he produced, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, The New Atlantis.
[01:11:15.283 --> 01:11:16.424]  David Bay is a great guy.
[01:11:16.825 --> 01:11:17.645]  I've known him for years.
[01:11:17.685 --> 01:11:21.869]  He carries a lot of my books and videos and things at Cutting Edge Ministries.
[01:11:21.889 --> 01:11:23.010]  We've got links to his website.
[01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:26.113]  I hope you will go to Infowars.com and get this film.
[01:11:26.133 --> 01:11:30.677]  I hope to have him with us into the next hour so we can take phone calls on this subject.
[01:11:30.797 --> 01:11:31.898]  He can speak on any subject.
[01:11:31.918 --> 01:11:34.400]  9-11, the New World Order.
[01:11:34.841 --> 01:11:39.225]  But it all goes back to these occultic roots that I've been studying and
[01:11:40.522 --> 01:11:42.743]  So, David Bay, it's really great to have you on with us.
[01:11:42.983 --> 01:11:44.004]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:11:44.044 --> 01:11:44.945]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:11:45.285 --> 01:11:45.606]  You bet.
[01:11:45.646 --> 01:11:55.033]  Let's just launch right into how you produced this film, your great director, what it covers, and why this is so important in today's context.
[01:11:55.954 --> 01:12:04.560]  Well, I've been studying the New World Order and the Illuminati plan and how it relates to prophecy and all that for almost 20 years now.
[01:12:06.202 --> 01:12:20.126]  And the research for Volume 1, 2, 3, and 4 are basically in the can right now, and it's taken me 12 years to produce this research.
[01:12:20.847 --> 01:12:32.971]  But I wanted to show why America is the nation that it is today, why it is going the direction it's gone, especially since 9-11.
[01:12:33.591 --> 01:12:34.331]  And in this film...
[01:12:35.426 --> 01:12:36.767]  We got a big boost.
[01:12:36.927 --> 01:12:49.356]  We were just about ready to start serious script writing when President Bush gave his second inaugural address on January 20, 2005.
[01:12:50.137 --> 01:12:55.140]  And he made a statement toward the end of his speech that just brought me out of my chair.
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:59.824]  It was full of classical, occultic, cryptic statements.
[01:13:00.124 --> 01:13:00.824]  It really was.
[01:13:02.085 --> 01:13:04.427]  As was his first inaugural address.
[01:13:06.434 --> 01:13:13.219]  Toward the end of this second inaugural address, he said one specific thing, and we show this on our documentary.
[01:13:13.719 --> 01:13:21.945]  He says, when our founders declared a new order of the ages, they were acting on an ancient hope which is meant to be fulfilled.
[01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:34.414]  Now, the context of this statement was in his defense of his foreign policy in general and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in particular.
[01:13:35.143 --> 01:13:45.150]  And what George is saying is that he is, through the force of American arms, he is meaning to fulfill this new order of the ages, this ancient hope.
[01:13:46.111 --> 01:14:01.882]  Now, what intrigued me about this is that while new order of the ages is identical in meaning to the Novus Ordo Seclorum or new world order on the back of your dollar bill, it predates new world order.
[01:14:02.452 --> 01:14:05.473]  It predates Novus Ordo Seclorum by almost 200 years.
[01:14:06.133 --> 01:14:14.594]  It is a very ancient Rosicrucian, Sir Francis Bacon created model.
[01:14:15.454 --> 01:14:29.157]  And it took me right back where I wanted to start in this documentary, which is in the 1580s, when Sir Francis Bacon, Queen Elizabeth I, and her astrologer, John Dee, created this plan
[01:14:30.235 --> 01:14:32.677]  By the way, let me stop you.
[01:14:32.777 --> 01:14:34.438]  They wrote books about this.
[01:14:34.558 --> 01:14:39.140]  This was the hottest thing in London, in Europe, for decades and decades.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.222]  So understand, this is not David Bay's opinion.
[01:14:42.962 --> 01:14:44.083]  This is in their own words.
[01:14:44.123 --> 01:14:44.963]  These are occultists.
[01:14:45.023 --> 01:14:45.383]  Go ahead.
[01:14:45.744 --> 01:14:45.964]  Right.
[01:14:46.124 --> 01:14:47.344]  In fact, we let them speak.
[01:14:47.645 --> 01:14:51.547]  We let everybody speak in this video rather than being heavy-handed commentary.
[01:14:51.947 --> 01:14:54.008]  We let people speak for themselves.
[01:14:54.028 --> 01:14:59.071]  I think that's one of the reasons that this documentary is proving to be so magic right now.
[01:14:59.651 --> 01:15:08.156]  But yeah, they created this plan whereby England would indirectly lead the world
[01:15:09.011 --> 01:15:17.077]  Into this ancient order of the ages, this new world order, which by definition is a global government, economy, and religion.
[01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:20.640]  You say global government based on occultic principles.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:29.807]  Right, and once it is established, then they're going to stage a Masonic Christ to rule over it all.
[01:15:30.808 --> 01:15:34.170]  And so this was their plan, and England...
[01:15:37.307 --> 01:15:46.312]  was to play the role of creating the nation that would lead the nations of the world into this global system.
[01:15:46.452 --> 01:15:48.554]  England herself was not going to do it.
[01:15:48.754 --> 01:15:49.874]  They were to be the progenitor.
[01:15:50.435 --> 01:15:50.935]  Exactly.
[01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:57.139]  And the nation that they were to create was to come out of the North American colonies.
[01:15:58.099 --> 01:16:06.424]  And, of course, in 1580, they were largely unexplored, and England had yet to make a major effort.
[01:16:06.986 --> 01:16:18.471]  But this new nation was to be a new Atlantis, which is the old legendary nation, island nation, based on occult principles.
[01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:20.552]  The people were highly enlightened.
[01:16:20.572 --> 01:16:31.156]  They had a very high understanding of human consciousness and the godhood within and all that.
[01:16:32.057 --> 01:16:35.318]  And America was to be a recreation of this
[01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:44.030]  She was to be a nation of unprecedented military power, unprecedented diplomatic power.
[01:16:46.271 --> 01:17:01.239]  She was to be the most powerful nation that the world had ever seen in any era, and her power and her influence was to bring the people gradually into this global system called the New World Order.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.301]  And it all began back in the early 1580s.
[01:17:05.362 --> 01:17:17.246]  Over 400 years ago, I mean, this is clearly demonic that they were, quote, being given these occultic insights of what would happen, what would become.
[01:17:17.686 --> 01:17:18.387]  Clearly occultic.
[01:17:18.407 --> 01:17:24.249]  In fact, John Day, Sir Francis Bacon, and Queen Elizabeth I were all Rosicrucians.
[01:17:24.749 --> 01:17:27.870]  And that is a secret society that actually created Freemasonry.
[01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:28.810]  And...
[01:17:32.154 --> 01:17:46.303]  It claimed many Christian symbols, prayed to Jesus Christ, quoted Bible scripture a lot, but they also did things like witchcraft, commuting with the dead.
[01:17:46.843 --> 01:17:56.829]  They believed that supernatural spirits were just over into the next dimension, waiting and anxious to communicate with
[01:17:57.202 --> 01:18:00.124]  To perfected men in this world.
[01:18:00.184 --> 01:18:06.109]  And a perfected man, of course, is a member of a secret society who's gone through the rituals and all that.
[01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:17.758]  And they actually communicated with these spirits and got at least a certain degree of information from them.
[01:18:18.692 --> 01:18:24.454]  So it's clearly demonic and most definitely occultic.
[01:18:24.894 --> 01:18:25.755]  All right, stay there.
[01:18:25.795 --> 01:18:28.155]  We're talking to David Bay, Cutting Edge Ministries.
[01:18:28.175 --> 01:18:30.396]  We're going to tell you how to get this incredible film.
[01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:35.338]  And I want to just go through Volume 1 and then kind of give us a glimpse at some of the other volumes that are coming.
[01:18:35.998 --> 01:18:37.399]  And get into...
[01:18:38.872 --> 01:18:40.393]  Just the symbolism of D.C.
[01:18:40.453 --> 01:18:46.096]  itself, how it's laid out as an occult amulet or power center or totem.
[01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:50.338]  We'll be right back with our guest to understand what's happening today and in the future.
[01:18:50.898 --> 01:18:51.979]  One must know the past.
[01:18:54.173 --> 01:18:58.796]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:18:58.856 --> 01:18:59.597]  have diabetes.
[01:18:59.917 --> 01:19:06.862]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:19:07.002 --> 01:19:11.545]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:19:11.745 --> 01:19:14.567]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:20:22.283 --> 01:20:27.086]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.

[01:21:43.113 --> 01:21:44.154]  Not get available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:55.512]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:21:55.752 --> 01:21:57.975]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:21:58.295 --> 01:21:58.976]  New toenails?
[01:21:59.336 --> 01:22:00.337]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:22:01.318 --> 01:22:03.981]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:22:04.525 --> 01:22:05.965]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:22:05.985 --> 01:22:08.766]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[01:22:08.986 --> 01:22:10.367]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:22:10.387 --> 01:22:12.507]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:14.008]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:22:14.048 --> 01:22:16.848]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:22:17.068 --> 01:22:18.329]  Well, here's my secret.
[01:22:18.889 --> 01:22:19.929]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:20.409 --> 01:22:24.490]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:26.091]  Ah, so that's it.
[01:22:26.331 --> 01:22:28.891]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[01:22:29.172 --> 01:22:30.792]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[01:22:31.312 --> 01:22:34.375]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:35.316]  You bet.
[01:22:35.536 --> 01:22:39.640]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.321]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:22:41.701 --> 01:22:42.862]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:22:43.022 --> 01:22:44.704]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[01:22:45.064 --> 01:22:50.169]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[01:22:50.349 --> 01:22:51.370]  In the foot care section.
[01:22:59.762 --> 01:23:02.183]  David, we've already jumped right into the middle of this.
[01:23:02.283 --> 01:23:08.426]  Perhaps I should give you the floor and let you break down the film, which I've seen.
[01:23:08.466 --> 01:23:09.287]  It's just amazing.
[01:23:09.327 --> 01:23:10.948]  I recommend everybody else watch it.
[01:23:10.968 --> 01:23:18.571]  I had it for about three weeks before I finally got on the exercise bike here at the office and watched it late one night.
[01:23:19.332 --> 01:23:20.092]  Go through it for us.
[01:23:22.771 --> 01:23:45.945]  This plan was created, as I said before, by Sir Francis Bacon and Queen Elizabeth I and John Dee, and they foresaw that under America's leadership and America's economic power and military power, that the world would gradually move into a new world order.
[01:23:46.306 --> 01:23:51.569]  They foresaw this to be a benign process, to be a peaceful process.
[01:23:53.989 --> 01:23:55.310]  They didn't foresee world wars.
[01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.912]  They didn't foresee assassinations being required.
[01:23:57.932 --> 01:23:59.372]  It was a benign process.
[01:24:02.815 --> 01:24:20.005]  They figured that for maybe 500 years after they initiated their planning, the world would gradually come to... They believed that man is inherently good, as did all Rosicrucians, and that the evil could be educated and trained out of him.
[01:24:20.813 --> 01:24:21.416]  And so the...
[01:24:25.069 --> 01:24:44.677]  You know, succeeding generations would be better, slightly better than the previous generation, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, until one time, one moment in time, the entire world would undergo a paradigm shift in consciousness and suddenly realize the Godhood within them and come to an enlightened understanding.
[01:24:44.797 --> 01:24:47.498]  Of course, the exact opposite has happened.
[01:24:48.058 --> 01:24:51.880]  Well, the exact opposite happened because of Adam Wiesoft in 1776.
[01:24:53.812 --> 01:25:00.935]  What happened in 17... And we don't really go into this, because we're saving it for a succeeding volume, and we didn't want to get distracted here.
[01:25:00.955 --> 01:25:02.616]  But that's how this occultism is always designed.
[01:25:02.636 --> 01:25:10.199]  At the low level, they recruit saying, brotherly love, enlightenment, but then it's always the dark magicians that hijack it, or the Sith.
[01:25:10.539 --> 01:25:14.761]  Well, Adam Vitoff hijacked this in 1776.
[01:25:15.562 --> 01:25:23.145]  He basically told the... Of course, he was backed by Mayor Anshul Bauer, the money man who later changed his name to Rothschild.
[01:25:24.435 --> 01:25:27.698]  And I would say it was destined to be hijacked from the beginning.
[01:25:27.838 --> 01:25:28.679]  Well, I think so, yeah.
[01:25:28.699 --> 01:25:30.041]  It was designed to be hijacked.
[01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:33.745]  Well, at least Satan was designing it to be hijacked.
[01:25:33.765 --> 01:25:35.847]  I don't think Sir Francis Bacon meant it to be.
[01:25:36.408 --> 01:25:39.111]  But Adam Vesoff basically told...
[01:25:41.157 --> 01:25:53.660]  All the Freemasons in the world, including the Founding Fathers of America, you're crazy if you think this can come about, this wonderful global system can come about naturally and by just natural human evolution.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:03.962]  If it's going to happen, it's got to occur by war, world war, and blood and assassinations and that kind of activity.
[01:26:04.002 --> 01:26:08.003]  And Albert Pike said the same thing in the late 1870s.
[01:26:08.023 --> 01:26:10.084]  He said, we're going to have three world wars.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:11.621]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:12.181 --> 01:26:16.104]  And we're on the cusp of the third one.
[01:26:16.164 --> 01:26:23.149]  But in 1776, when Adam Wiesoft created his Masters of the Illuminati, it took him exactly 13 years to 1789 to...
[01:26:32.816 --> 01:26:36.899]  To take over all of the Masonic Lodges in Europe.
[01:26:37.119 --> 01:26:49.769]  And by the way, there was a big fight, of course, and this is in mainstream writings by George Washington and others and John Quincy Adams, that they realized this, because there were really Rosicrucians, a lot of them, and openly were fighting it and then outlawing it.
[01:26:49.789 --> 01:26:51.090]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:59.217]  This VSoft fiery brand of revolutionary war absolutely frightened every...
[01:27:00.187 --> 01:27:06.231]  I mean, every founding father except for Ben Franklin and possibly Thomas Jefferson.
[01:27:06.251 --> 01:27:11.393]  Those were the only two that were in the VSOC camp.
[01:27:11.874 --> 01:27:20.959]  But, yeah, the American fathers basically kept it out of American lodges until the early 1800s when they had all passed away.
[01:27:21.879 --> 01:27:26.462]  And so it's important for Masons to know today, then, to understand this.
[01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:27.602]  Yes, it is.
[01:27:28.003 --> 01:27:28.503]  Absolutely.
[01:27:29.908 --> 01:27:42.411]  But the founding fathers really believed in the benign aspect of the Bacon Plan.
[01:27:42.551 --> 01:27:49.812]  And in 1776, they had their key man, which is Ben Franklin, in place.
[01:27:50.072 --> 01:27:53.793]  He had already been, you know, to make sure to work with British authorities.
[01:27:54.338 --> 01:28:01.224]  To make sure that America was established exactly as the Bacon Plan foresaw.
[01:28:01.244 --> 01:28:12.713]  And Bacon actually had made several trips to London, specifically to meet with British Masons, British intelligence officials.
[01:28:13.113 --> 01:28:14.675]  And of course he ended up dying there.
[01:28:14.715 --> 01:28:15.956]  He ended up moving there and living there.
[01:28:16.436 --> 01:28:16.676]  Right.
[01:28:18.038 --> 01:28:21.040]  But he went there first in 1758.
[01:28:22.768 --> 01:28:27.029]  To discuss the implementation of Bacon's Plan in America.
[01:28:27.369 --> 01:28:27.769]  Stay there.
[01:28:27.789 --> 01:28:29.950]  We're going to be right back after this break and continue.
[01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:32.451]  We will open the phones up and take your calls.
[01:28:32.471 --> 01:28:32.711]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:32.791 --> 01:28:40.273]  Get to all the callers that are holding and continue with this historical document.
[01:28:43.854 --> 01:28:44.754]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.254 --> 01:28:46.835]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.855 --> 01:28:50.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.732 --> 01:28:55.433]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:28:55.853 --> 01:28:58.814]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:28:59.154 --> 01:29:04.436]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:29:04.736 --> 01:29:14.259]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:29:14.539 --> 01:29:16.740]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.582]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:29:20.842 --> 01:29:24.084]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:29:24.365 --> 01:29:27.907]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:29:28.047 --> 01:29:31.529]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:32.910]  I'm really amazed.
[01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:38.913]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:29:39.073 --> 01:29:41.475]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.

[01:30:53.349 --> 01:30:55.710]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:57.971]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:58.131 --> 01:31:05.174]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:05.434 --> 01:31:14.038]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:03.870]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:10.733]  All right, callers, Angela, David, Chris, Don, many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:10.753 --> 01:32:14.074]  No matter what issue or topic you bring up, David Bacon, speak to it.
[01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:17.816]  I know he's very informed about the entire New World Order system.
[01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:22.118]  It would be nice to hear specific discussions of the globalists, the Illuminati, their plan, what they're up to.
[01:32:22.138 --> 01:32:23.119]  Before we go back to David...
[01:32:23.639 --> 01:32:24.600]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.340]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:35.485]  I mean real, hard to find, all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, chlorides, glycerins, lanolens, synthetic vitamins or antibacterials?
[01:32:35.565 --> 01:32:36.285]  Probably never, right?
[01:32:36.725 --> 01:32:40.227]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company has been around for 59 years.
[01:32:40.747 --> 01:32:41.888]  Almost 60, folks.
[01:32:42.698 --> 01:32:47.120]  And has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for health care professionals and hospitals.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:50.641]  Now, for the first time, you can get Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:32:51.021 --> 01:32:53.582]  It is available factory direct at you and your family.
[01:32:53.903 --> 01:33:00.165]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[01:33:00.185 --> 01:33:07.368]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, give them a call and get a free catalog or some of their samples.
[01:33:07.828 --> 01:33:08.288]  We're good to go.
[01:33:33.328 --> 01:33:36.509]  And that website is CalBenPureSoap.com.
[01:33:36.529 --> 01:33:39.230]  That's C-A-L-B-E-N PureSoap.com.
[01:33:39.630 --> 01:33:47.292]  On the left-hand side of InfoWars.com, about midway down, we have a big link, banner to CalBenPureSoap.com.
[01:33:47.812 --> 01:33:51.793]  And for like $14, you get this sampler pack that's got to be worth like $40, $50.
[01:33:53.994 --> 01:34:00.376]  With shampoo, dishwasher, clothes washing, bar soap, moisturizer, cream.
[01:34:01.327 --> 01:34:01.767]  For $14.
[01:34:02.108 --> 01:34:05.249]  And it really is triple concentrated and it's made from plants.
[01:34:05.309 --> 01:34:07.090]  It's made from vegetables.
[01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:08.191]  It's made from citrus.
[01:34:08.551 --> 01:34:12.293]  It's got cherry oil, almond oil, and it smells so good.
[01:34:12.333 --> 01:34:13.254]  We use it here at the office.
[01:34:13.754 --> 01:34:14.514]  I use it at home.
[01:34:14.575 --> 01:34:16.876]  My staff thought, man, you're not hyping this.
[01:34:16.896 --> 01:34:17.556]  This is really good.
[01:34:17.576 --> 01:34:18.917]  And I said, I don't hype stuff.
[01:34:18.937 --> 01:34:19.777]  This really is good.
[01:34:20.358 --> 01:34:22.319]  So it costs less.
[01:34:23.038 --> 01:34:23.818]  We're good to go.
[01:34:53.038 --> 01:34:58.565]  We're called toll free to get the new Atlantis at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:59.667 --> 01:35:00.728]  Going back to David Bay.
[01:35:00.748 --> 01:35:05.975]  David, continuing... I mean, I guess a good place to get into this is this war.
[01:35:06.816 --> 01:35:09.800]  Because when you actually read letters before his death...
[01:35:10.459 --> 01:35:25.197]  Where George Washington is saying, look, I'm a Mason, and I believe in all this great society stuff, but I don't believe in this, quote, dark Masonry, this occultic stuff, and this evil takeover.
[01:35:25.217 --> 01:35:27.720]  Then, of course, John Quincy Adams and then his son.
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.664]  Well, yeah, Washington and other founding fathers were terribly alarmed by the Adam Beesoff brand of a violent twist
[01:35:56.396 --> 01:35:57.658]  ...to Bacon's plan.
[01:35:57.798 --> 01:36:08.608]  And at one point in one of these letters, not too long before his death, Washington actually called the VSOFT plan diabolical, which, of course, is devilish from the devil.
[01:36:08.868 --> 01:36:10.690]  And they... Because our...
[01:36:11.828 --> 01:36:27.751]  Except for Jefferson and Franklin, our founding fathers really believed that Bacon was right, that this would come about very peacefully and most benignly, and they did not foresee three world wars.
[01:36:27.872 --> 01:36:34.473]  They did not foresee assassinations and regime changes and invasions and that kind of thing.
[01:36:35.113 --> 01:36:39.354]  So when our president says that he is committed to achieving the ancient order of the ages,
[01:36:39.798 --> 01:36:42.680]  He's really telling a half-truth, which is a whole lie.
[01:36:43.561 --> 01:36:50.246]  Yes, he is over there to try to bring about this final global kingdom.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:56.963]  But he's doing it by force of arms, which is the VSOF principle, not the Bacon principle.
[01:36:57.243 --> 01:37:09.829]  Well, the Weishauptians, at the time that he was around, and then a hundred years later with the Grand Master Albert Pike, I mean, they wrote, I feel the power of Lucifer seething in my hands.
[01:37:09.869 --> 01:37:11.649]  I mean, these guys were sick.
[01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:14.391]  Yeah, and Manly P. Hall says that...
[01:37:15.444 --> 01:37:34.274]  You know, in his Lost Keys of Freemasonry, he says, when the master mason learns the secret of his craft, he shall have the seething power of Lucifer in his hands, which is a perfect description of what a black magic witch has, that kind of power, when he correctly performs a ritual.
[01:37:34.755 --> 01:37:41.278]  So, you know, it's most definitely black magic witchcraft, which, of course, is what Skull and Bones is.
[01:37:41.899 --> 01:37:42.659]  Skull and Bones is...
[01:37:43.067 --> 01:37:47.468]  Is black magic a masonically based secret society?
[01:37:48.549 --> 01:37:49.649]  And that's not debatable.
[01:37:49.929 --> 01:37:53.510]  I mean, Peter Jennings did a newscast on it, and he said, oh, it's no big deal.
[01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:58.692]  I mean, George Bush has engaged in satanic rituals his entire adult life.
[01:37:59.192 --> 01:38:07.194]  Well, see, Skull and Bones is part of a global system of satanic covens called Brotherhood of Death Societies.
[01:38:07.955 --> 01:38:12.596]  And each major nation on Earth is allowed only one Brotherhood of Death Society.
[01:38:13.277 --> 01:38:14.957]  And in America, that's Yale.
[01:38:15.998 --> 01:38:25.740]  But in Europe, in Germany, the One Brotherhood of Death Society there is the Thule Society, or some people call it the Thule Society, T-H-U-L-E.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:31.301]  And that society is the one that trained Adolf Hitler in all of the powers.
[01:38:31.401 --> 01:38:39.143]  And again, that's on History Channel now, and of course I cover that in my film, The Order of Death, hence the Brotherhood of Death.
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:43.021]  I think these two films are good companions together.
[01:38:43.321 --> 01:38:46.602]  America's Beginnings, The New Atlantis, and The Order of Death.
[01:38:46.822 --> 01:38:49.864]  Yeah, I see that you have them combined on your website.
[01:38:50.144 --> 01:38:50.364]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:50.384 --> 01:38:51.764]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:38:51.844 --> 01:38:52.805]  It's a great combination.
[01:38:53.205 --> 01:39:06.450]  But that's the... What most people don't understand, and they need to, whether they like it or not is another point, but they need to understand this, that since Skull and Bones is identical to The Tool Society...
[01:39:07.037 --> 01:39:10.418]  That means that Preska Bush, George H.W.
[01:39:10.478 --> 01:39:14.720]  Bush, and George Zilby Bush have all gone through the same rituals that Hitler went through.
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:19.141]  You need to understand that and come to grip with that.
[01:39:20.502 --> 01:39:27.444]  And of course, that's why Preska Bush in the early 20s started money flowing to the Nazi Party through his Union City Bank.
[01:39:29.305 --> 01:39:35.507]  So it's all a very worldwide tight fit.
[01:39:36.730 --> 01:39:37.790]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:58.556]  I mean, how over 130 years ago could the global head of masonry, Albert Pike, founder of the Klan, you never heard Jesse Jackson say take down his statue right next door to the Supreme Court, how could he say we're going to have three world wars and then detail exactly how they would take place?
[01:39:58.756 --> 01:40:02.377]  Yeah, not only that, but in 1870 when he had that demonic vision,
[01:40:05.576 --> 01:40:16.862]  The most incredible thing to me is that he said that the Third World War would start between Israel and her Arab neighbors, and would expand out to include the whole world, and out of that war would come the Masonic Christ.
[01:40:16.982 --> 01:40:18.962]  And Israel wouldn't exist for 70 years.
[01:40:19.123 --> 01:40:19.683]  Exactly.
[01:40:20.123 --> 01:40:28.407]  The only people in 1870 who were saying that Israel was going to come back to her land at the end of the age were Bible-thumping Christians.
[01:40:29.039 --> 01:40:30.140]  I mean, nobody else believed it.
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:32.141]  Not even Jews dare believe it.
[01:40:33.081 --> 01:40:38.444]  None of the ardent Zionists that were in the world at that time dare believe that this could ever happen.
[01:40:39.505 --> 01:40:46.429]  But, I mean, it just shows you the limited foreknowledge that the demonic host has.
[01:40:48.230 --> 01:40:53.233]  Because this third world war is coming down exactly as they had said.
[01:40:53.803 --> 01:40:59.146]  But I'd like to make a point about Ben Franklin, if I could, before we take any calls, because there's something important here.
[01:41:00.186 --> 01:41:16.575]  Ben Franklin met on several occasions, beginning in 1758, with Sir Francis Dashwood, who was a member of Parliament, and British Masons, especially the Masons controlling the British intelligence at the time.
[01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:25.759]  And they met through the offices of Sir Francis Dashwood's Hellfire Club.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.241]  Now, that was a true gentleman's club.
[01:41:28.301 --> 01:41:33.905]  In fact, that's where we get the term for a stripper joint, is the Hellfire Club.
[01:41:33.925 --> 01:41:34.926]  It was called the Gentleman's Club.
[01:41:35.407 --> 01:41:38.569]  It was a place of debauchery for British nobility.
[01:41:39.207 --> 01:41:45.192]  If a British nobleman wanted to get blind drunk, he could go to the Hellfire Club.
[01:41:45.212 --> 01:41:48.214]  If he wanted to take drugs, go to the Hellfire Club.
[01:41:48.234 --> 01:41:50.896]  If he wanted a sexual orgy, go to the Hellfire Club.
[01:41:51.617 --> 01:42:02.105]  And while Benjamin Franklin was a playboy, a known playboy, and undoubtedly took advantage of these pleasures, he went there with another reason in mind also.
[01:42:02.526 --> 01:42:06.749]  And that was to meet in the back rooms, in the subterranean rooms, with key...
[01:42:09.409 --> 01:42:14.170]  Key members of the British intelligence and key ministers of the parliament.
[01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:16.331]  We're going to get to that in a second.
[01:42:16.371 --> 01:42:17.972]  I should have thought of this before the interview.
[01:42:18.012 --> 01:42:19.892]  I thought of it last week when we set the interview up.
[01:42:20.372 --> 01:42:22.853]  Scott, it's been in the computer for years.
[01:42:23.633 --> 01:42:26.074]  I know it's there because we replayed it about six months ago.
[01:42:27.294 --> 01:42:30.995]  It's Benjamin Franklin Hellfire Club, something along those lines.
[01:42:31.055 --> 01:42:36.037]  It's a clip from History Channel admitting all the orgies and satanic rituals, even mainstream news.
[01:42:37.242 --> 01:42:38.103]  Try to find that.
[01:42:38.123 --> 01:42:43.866]  If not, I will find it and instant message you a hyperlink to it, but I want to play that before the hour ends.
[01:42:43.886 --> 01:42:44.927]  You get that message, Scott?
[01:42:45.747 --> 01:42:46.548]  Fantastic.
[01:42:46.768 --> 01:42:47.889]  Please continue, David Bay.
[01:42:47.989 --> 01:42:48.189]  Okay.
[01:42:48.369 --> 01:43:01.998]  Anyway, British intelligence worked so closely with Franklin as an agent that they gave him two code names.
[01:43:02.098 --> 01:43:05.260]  One was number 72, and the other one was Moses.
[01:43:06.107 --> 01:43:09.908]  Now, when I discovered this initially, I was stunned.
[01:43:10.108 --> 01:43:10.629]  Moses?
[01:43:11.589 --> 01:43:13.790]  But I thought of what the biblical Moses did.
[01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:16.670]  He led the people of Israel... Out of bondage.
[01:43:17.311 --> 01:43:21.272]  Out of bondage from Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh.
[01:43:21.372 --> 01:43:22.412]  He was a rebel leader.
[01:43:23.133 --> 01:43:23.333]  Right.
[01:43:23.813 --> 01:43:31.155]  And that's exactly what British intelligence, who was committed to the Bacon Plan, envisioned for Franklin.
[01:43:31.555 --> 01:43:33.816]  He was to be a more modern-day Moses.
[01:43:34.552 --> 01:43:45.334]  He was to lead the American people out from control of Egypt, I mean, from Great Britain, out of control of the more modern pharaoh, King George III.
[01:43:46.554 --> 01:44:02.397]  And so British intelligence and key Masonic ministers of parliament were very supportive of Ben Franklin and his implementation in the Americas
[01:44:02.893 --> 01:44:03.833]  Of Bacon's plan.
[01:44:04.213 --> 01:44:18.338]  Now, two current British historians whom we quote in this documentary actually asked the question, was Ben Franklin a British agent working for the British?
[01:44:19.239 --> 01:44:25.721]  Thus implying that Franklin may have been trying to sell the American ideal out.
[01:44:27.141 --> 01:44:28.722]  And that is in no way the case.
[01:44:29.622 --> 01:44:31.663]  The traitor...
[01:44:32.512 --> 01:44:33.352]  And there is one here.
[01:44:33.472 --> 01:44:45.815]  But the traitors are the British masons, both in Parliament and controlling British intelligence, who were working in direct opposition to King George's policies.
[01:44:46.615 --> 01:44:48.756]  They owed allegiance to their monarch.
[01:44:49.356 --> 01:44:55.717]  And they betrayed him so that they could implement Bacon's plan.
[01:44:56.318 --> 01:44:57.698]  But my point is,
[01:44:58.208 --> 01:45:03.173]  That this is a characteristic of a Freemason.
[01:45:03.653 --> 01:45:16.585]  They are not, they are ministers, I mean, they are citizens of a global ideal, a global state, rather than patriots to their own country.
[01:45:17.285 --> 01:45:21.930]  And if they are ever asked to have to choose between
[01:45:22.443 --> 01:45:29.193]  Patriotism to their own country and patriotism to the global plan, the global state which they envision.
[01:45:29.473 --> 01:45:31.116]  They will always choose the global state.
[01:45:32.999 --> 01:45:34.040]  And that's what's happening.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.946]  Again, when we're about to elect a Freemason president, people really ought to know that.
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:39.940]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:48.244]  And then now look at what's happening here today with the Pan-American Union, the European Union, all these guys working together to bring this in.
[01:45:48.304 --> 01:45:59.428]  George Bush and Vicente Fox and the PR firm Bush uses in Dallas for his elections, staging all these protests and demonstrations with the media.
[01:46:01.008 --> 01:46:02.009]  So that's a modern...
[01:46:02.677 --> 01:46:04.759]  They believe in it with all their hearts.
[01:46:26.696 --> 01:46:27.857]  With all their hearts, they believe this.
[01:46:27.897 --> 01:46:33.779]  They believe as much as Christians believe the doctrine that Jesus Christ was God.
[01:46:33.859 --> 01:46:36.740]  I mean, this is doctrine to them.
[01:46:37.721 --> 01:46:41.122]  And there's silly people who say, oh, something can't last for 500 years.
[01:46:41.182 --> 01:46:42.303]  What do universities do?
[01:46:42.703 --> 01:46:44.084]  What do religious sects do?
[01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:51.907]  The elites of those organizations sit in power over the organization while the mission of the corporation is to grow and expand.
[01:46:52.287 --> 01:46:55.689]  In fact, almost every major institution is as old as the hills.
[01:46:56.323 --> 01:46:56.523]  Right.
[01:46:57.023 --> 01:47:04.325]  You know, I ask people that doubt that a plan like this could be passed down that many generations.
[01:47:04.385 --> 01:47:09.786]  I ask them, how has Christianity survived these past 2,000 years?
[01:47:10.186 --> 01:47:12.507]  And their answer to me is, the church.
[01:47:13.107 --> 01:47:13.707]  Absolutely.
[01:47:13.767 --> 01:47:18.808]  The church was the vehicle by which Christianity was passed from generation to generation.
[01:47:19.346 --> 01:47:23.049]  In like manner, secret societies are the church of the occult.
[01:47:23.329 --> 01:47:30.494]  Yeah, they have their own banks, their own universities, they founded their own institutions, and literally you see these societies as a throne.
[01:47:30.915 --> 01:47:36.539]  The throne goes on forever or for thousands of years, and then it's whoever sits in that high office.
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:38.000]  Right.
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:45.745]  I mean, these guys are doing just as President Bush alluded in his second inaugural address.
[01:47:46.206 --> 01:47:47.787]  They are looking toward...
[01:47:48.348 --> 01:47:50.889]  The plan of the ancient order of the ages.
[01:47:51.370 --> 01:48:01.295]  They're following the twisted plan that Vesop created as he hijacked the Bacon Plan in 1776.
[01:48:01.955 --> 01:48:09.960]  And believe me, these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were planned decades and decades ago.
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:12.241]  Hey, Scott, did you find that clip?
[01:48:13.883 --> 01:48:18.827]  Let's go ahead and roll this clip from the History Channel about the Hellfire Club and Benjamin Franklin.
[01:48:18.867 --> 01:48:19.327]  Here it is.
[01:48:19.988 --> 01:48:26.333]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[01:48:30.303 --> 01:48:44.715]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and mocking its sacred rituals.
[01:48:44.795 --> 01:48:49.579]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:55.644]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.642]  I think that says it all, doesn't it?
[01:49:00.662 --> 01:49:01.542]  That says it all.
[01:49:01.782 --> 01:49:04.484]  I did not realize that the History Channel ran that.
[01:49:05.445 --> 01:49:06.186]  That's amazing.
[01:49:06.346 --> 01:49:09.769]  That's an amazing corroboration of what we just said.
[01:49:10.389 --> 01:49:13.091]  Well, we'll play it again later in the next hour in case anybody missed it.
[01:49:13.111 --> 01:49:15.433]  You can tell your friends and family or neighbors to tune in for that.
[01:49:15.773 --> 01:49:16.614]  We're going to go to break now.
[01:49:16.634 --> 01:49:18.195]  When we come back, we'll take some calls.
[01:49:18.215 --> 01:49:18.976]  There's a lot of other issues.
[01:49:19.276 --> 01:49:22.739]  David, do you want to ride shotgun with us well into the next hour?
[01:49:22.979 --> 01:49:23.159]  Sure.
[01:49:23.909 --> 01:49:24.809]  Okay, we'll do that.
[01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:27.791]  And we've got Debbie Morrow popping in later in the next hour for about four minutes.
[01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:29.952]  But we'll come back and take all your calls.
[01:49:30.892 --> 01:49:31.792]  There's a lot of other news.
[01:49:32.553 --> 01:49:38.895]  And in about, I guess, 45 minutes of the next hour or so, we'll let David go and I'll cover some news we haven't gotten to and recap some top stories.
[01:49:38.915 --> 01:49:44.718]  So it's all jam-packed on this live Thursday edition, the 13th day of April, 2006.
[01:49:45.518 --> 01:49:50.180]  Hey, I better schedule a tax time guest.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.841]  I've forgotten to do that.
[01:49:53.772 --> 01:50:00.595]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.935 --> 01:50:02.295]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.495 --> 01:50:04.696]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.856 --> 01:50:06.937]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.217 --> 01:50:12.139]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.479 --> 01:50:16.521]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.761 --> 01:50:18.543]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.623 --> 01:50:29.271]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.411 --> 01:50:31.313]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.533 --> 01:50:35.396]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:50:35.476 --> 01:50:37.058]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:50:37.078 --> 01:50:37.598]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:50:43.963 --> 01:50:45.226]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.098 --> 01:51:01.365]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.626 --> 01:51:05.969]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:15.198]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.398 --> 01:51:19.021]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.301 --> 01:51:24.329]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.630 --> 01:51:31.360]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:32.381]  What about you?
[01:51:33.061 --> 01:51:33.761]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:14.231]  David Bay, Cutting Edge Ministries, is our guest.
[01:53:14.251 --> 01:53:16.291]  We carry his new film that he produced.
[01:53:16.311 --> 01:53:18.551]  It's a monumental achievement.
[01:53:18.571 --> 01:53:19.332]  You need to have it.
[01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:23.712]  Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, The New Atlantis.
[01:53:24.473 --> 01:53:30.074]  Available at the online video and bookstore on the secure shopping cart, infowars.com right now.
[01:53:30.374 --> 01:53:32.114]  Or call toll free to secure your copy, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:36.275 --> 01:53:36.855]  David in Illinois.
[01:53:36.875 --> 01:53:37.736]  You're on the air, David.
[01:54:07.093 --> 01:54:07.353]  Hello?
[01:54:07.673 --> 01:54:07.953]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:07.993 --> 01:54:09.554]  Go ahead.
[01:54:10.234 --> 01:54:15.655]  Hello to David Bay, and I look forward to looking at his Secret Mysteries film.
[01:54:16.355 --> 01:54:27.937]  It's because of his research, Alex, and the research of others, along with the teaching of educators such as yourself, that we see these historical manipulations of events and social control in context.
[01:54:28.037 --> 01:54:35.359]  And it's important that we see that in context, because without that context, we can't understand how we're being manipulated in the present.
[01:54:37.154 --> 01:54:40.936]  It's very important that the researchers and the education continue here.
[01:54:41.257 --> 01:54:45.999]  And Alex, by the way, I want to congratulate you on elevating the visibility of 9-11 with Sheen.
[01:54:46.019 --> 01:54:54.804]  It's because of you and the work that Sheen did together that a new audience of hundreds of thousands were exposed.
[01:54:54.944 --> 01:54:56.324]  Millions, millions, sir.
[01:54:56.364 --> 01:55:03.128]  I was out in California in the last three days and everywhere I went people walked up to myself and said,
[01:55:03.801 --> 01:55:06.802]  Well, I just wanted to say I support him in his work in continuing research and education.
[01:55:32.367 --> 01:55:38.756]  I was wanting to say something about Lou Dobbs, but I don't want to take... I support Lou Dobbs and what he's doing, but I don't want to take time right now.
[01:55:38.796 --> 01:55:39.337]  No, go ahead.
[01:55:39.417 --> 01:55:41.340]  Somebody brought up Lou Dobbs earlier.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.261]  Go ahead and make your comment.
[01:55:43.007 --> 01:55:52.393]  Well, the caller made some charges there that he was maybe supporting a new world agenda or something like that, and I just don't think that's the case.
[01:55:52.493 --> 01:56:01.459]  Well, I said I like him, and I said that it seems like he's doing a pretty good job, but I have seen him say, well, you know, the National ID card will deal with this and stuff like that, so there are some problems.
[01:56:01.499 --> 01:56:02.980]  But he's better than what we've got.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.303]  You know, we've got to be thankful for stuff that's better than, you know, O'Reilly or Hillary Clinton, I mean.
[01:56:08.015 --> 01:56:08.936]  Right, absolutely.
[01:56:09.216 --> 01:56:18.346]  You know, everybody is not going to be 100% correct on everything, and I think that every night he's pounding on the issues of free trade, outsourcing, open borders.
[01:56:19.122 --> 01:56:21.124]  And non-enforcement of immigration laws.
[01:56:21.144 --> 01:56:24.687]  And that right there, if you turn him in tonight, you'll see that.
[01:56:24.927 --> 01:56:25.367]  I hear you.
[01:56:25.808 --> 01:56:26.689]  He's getting an audience.
[01:56:27.029 --> 01:56:28.610]  He's getting an audience showing that people want that.
[01:56:28.891 --> 01:56:30.832]  David Bay, comments on what our caller just said?
[01:56:31.793 --> 01:56:38.719]  Well, you've got to have a perspective on history to understand the present.
[01:56:38.779 --> 01:56:43.023]  And that's what this documentary is based upon.
[01:56:44.044 --> 01:56:45.305]  We stay very clearly.
[01:56:45.325 --> 01:56:46.886]  If you're going to understand history,
[01:56:47.924 --> 01:56:55.508]  Why Bush has us in Iraq and Afghanistan, you have to go back 400 years to the origins of this plan.
[01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:58.570]  Well, we'll talk more about that when we get back.
[01:56:58.590 --> 01:57:00.011]  We'll also take your calls again.
[01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:06.895]  It would be nice specifically on this issue, but any issue is fine because it's all interconnected.
[01:57:06.915 --> 01:57:07.255]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:07.995 --> 01:57:09.436]  And again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:57:09.996 --> 01:57:12.558]  David Bay is riding shotgun with us into the next hour.
[01:57:13.425 --> 01:57:14.926]  And we'll get into a lot of other facets.
[01:57:14.946 --> 01:57:16.887]  The occult setup of D.C.
[01:57:16.967 --> 01:57:17.407]  itself.
[01:57:17.848 --> 01:57:19.008]  How the city is built.
[01:57:19.028 --> 01:57:25.892]  And they admit it's set up along Masonic slash Rosicrucian slash Illuminati guidestones.
[01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:29.154]  As are most American East Coast cities.
[01:57:29.534 --> 01:57:30.215]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:30.275 --> 01:57:30.735]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.717 --> 01:57:37.599]  If you would like a copy of this show, head to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.939 --> 01:57:38.799]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.881 --> 01:57:50.521]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.202 --> 01:57:52.262]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.963 --> 01:57:54.043]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.723 --> 01:57:55.544]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.284 --> 01:57:57.205]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.845 --> 01:58:01.527]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.047 --> 01:58:06.169]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.531 --> 01:58:10.292]  Now into hour number three.
[01:58:10.372 --> 01:58:14.614]  David Bay of Cutting Edge Ministries joining us, talking about the...
[01:58:15.811 --> 01:58:22.834]  Secret societies that helped found America, how they were hijacked by the Illuminati, what we face today, their global master plan.
[01:58:22.854 --> 01:58:28.276]  We'll get into the architecture of the Illuminati, literal and figurative, coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:28.316 --> 01:58:30.697]  Right now, let's continue with your calls.
[01:58:30.717 --> 01:58:32.538]  Let's talk to Don in North Carolina.
[01:58:32.878 --> 01:58:33.798]  Don, you're on the air.
[01:58:33.818 --> 01:58:34.839]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:34.899 --> 01:58:35.939]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:58:36.119 --> 01:58:36.479]  You bet.
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:38.380]  I'm a pilot from U.S.
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:43.342]  Airways, but I spoke to you before, and I'd mentioned, you know,
[01:58:44.037 --> 01:58:46.218]  At our airline, they terminated all the pensions.
[01:58:47.058 --> 01:58:56.221]  When I started doing some research, we had the senior advisor from Rothschild on the board of directors and also the chairman of Rothschild North America.
[01:58:57.301 --> 01:59:00.683]  The more I dug, the more I started finding.
[01:59:01.143 --> 01:59:02.503]  You called about three years ago.
[01:59:02.803 --> 01:59:04.144]  Yeah, I called several times.
[01:59:04.944 --> 01:59:06.464]  Here's something that's really unusual.
[01:59:06.484 --> 01:59:08.185]  I don't think it's an accident.
[01:59:09.033 --> 01:59:12.296]  Our former CEO at US Airways, he was from India.
[01:59:12.536 --> 01:59:17.019]  And they're starting a new airline in India called Indigo Air.
[01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:23.805]  And the company that's financing this operation is called Interglobe Enterprises.
[01:59:24.125 --> 01:59:35.554]  Now, if you go to their website, they have the IG for their name, Indigo Enterprises, is in the shape of a pyramid with a red capstone pyramid.
[01:59:35.854 --> 01:59:38.236]  And it spins around and around while you're on the website.
[01:59:38.837 --> 01:59:44.902]  But if you go and you look at their address, one of their addresses at the very first location.
[01:59:45.462 --> 01:59:47.083]  Now, listen to this address.
[01:59:47.143 --> 01:59:54.409]  It's Interglobe Air Transport, Galileo, India, 911 Upper Level Empire Towers.
[01:59:54.909 --> 01:59:55.630]  That's the address.
[01:59:56.210 --> 01:59:57.591]  And all their phone numbers start with 911.
[01:59:57.932 --> 02:00:01.134]  They have 911 or 911 in them.
[02:00:01.334 --> 02:00:06.538]  And also, I noticed, if you go to the Grand Lodge of India, all of their phone numbers are 911.
[02:00:08.579 --> 02:00:11.480]  And if you go to U.S.
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:17.782]  China Chamber of Commerce, Prescott Bush, their last three phone number digits are 911.
[02:00:17.922 --> 02:00:19.943]  This isn't a coincidence.
[02:00:20.163 --> 02:00:20.423]  No, no.
[02:00:20.863 --> 02:00:25.324]  Listen, almost all the major corporate logos are all seeing eyes, pyramids, numerology.
[02:00:25.384 --> 02:00:26.945]  This is a part of their religion.
[02:00:26.985 --> 02:00:28.005]  David Bay, comment on that.
[02:00:29.386 --> 02:00:30.986]  Well, absolutely.
[02:00:31.006 --> 02:00:31.506]  We have seen...
[02:00:36.724 --> 02:00:45.176]  Such a determined drive to bring all facets under their control.
[02:00:46.318 --> 02:00:47.139]  These numbers, 911, 666...
[02:00:50.210 --> 02:00:54.533]  And, you know, 11s and 13s and multiples thereof.
[02:00:55.234 --> 02:00:54.533]  32, 33.
[02:00:57.616 --> 02:00:58.796]  Absolutely.
[02:00:58.957 --> 02:00:59.977]  They just predominate.
[02:00:59.997 --> 02:01:10.565]  In fact, if you look in the news, and at Cutting Edge we put up a daily news update, which is a modified Drudge Report format where we list...
[02:01:11.105 --> 02:01:13.926]  You know, 40 to 70 articles a day.
[02:01:14.486 --> 02:01:18.407]  It's amazing to see these occult numbers pop up in the daily news.
[02:01:19.107 --> 02:01:27.369]  11 killed here, 44 killed in a mine accident, 33, 22, you know, it's just amazing.
[02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:29.169]  These numbers pop up everywhere.
[02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:31.250]  Well, they admit that that's part of their religion.
[02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:34.771]  Well, see, they, yes, they are pagans.
[02:01:35.231 --> 02:01:39.372]  And pagans worship the creature rather than the creator, according to Romans 1.25.
[02:01:40.808 --> 02:01:43.851]  And that's why these guys worship the sun, the moon, the stars.
[02:01:44.532 --> 02:01:48.615]  They worship numbers.
[02:01:50.057 --> 02:01:51.298]  Numbers is one of God's creations.
[02:01:51.598 --> 02:01:56.623]  They believe that certain occult numbers contain inherent power.
[02:01:57.364 --> 02:02:04.749]  And so they believe that a good plan can literally fail if it's not carried out according to the numbers.
[02:02:04.989 --> 02:02:06.350]  Caller, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:07.010]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:07.050 --> 02:02:08.491]  Let me just add a caveat to that.
[02:02:08.511 --> 02:02:24.661]  It's admitted by his own astrologer, and Nancy Reagan admits it, that down to the day, to the hour, to the minute, to the color of the tie he wore, everything was occultic in the astrology of what Ronald Reagan did.
[02:02:25.814 --> 02:02:29.497]  Now, for most of us, that sounds completely nuts.
[02:02:29.597 --> 02:02:31.139]  But that's what these guys believe in.
[02:02:31.519 --> 02:02:33.380]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:34.441]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:02:34.461 --> 02:02:35.362]  David Bay is our guest.
[02:02:35.802 --> 02:02:43.649]  And we will get into some of the most incredible evidence of this occult empire, the architecture of Eastern American cities.
[02:02:46.744 --> 02:02:49.606]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.866 --> 02:02:50.567]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.647 --> 02:02:51.448]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.788 --> 02:02:56.451]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.792 --> 02:03:03.537]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.857 --> 02:03:05.839]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.039 --> 02:03:08.881]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.981 --> 02:03:13.645]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.845 --> 02:03:18.248]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.489 --> 02:03:25.714]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.975 --> 02:03:28.396]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.557 --> 02:03:30.298]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:45.808 --> 02:03:46.508]  Hello, folks.
[02:03:46.528 --> 02:03:53.370]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[02:03:53.610 --> 02:04:00.731]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:04:00.851 --> 02:04:12.394]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:04:12.774 --> 02:04:14.394]  Its multi-voltage capabilities
[02:04:14.394 --> 02:04:20.759]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:20.799 --> 02:04:21.520]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:46.139 --> 02:04:49.463]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[02:04:49.883 --> 02:04:54.048]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[02:04:54.588 --> 02:05:01.976]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance crew and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[02:05:02.389 --> 02:05:06.373]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[02:05:06.753 --> 02:05:20.205]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[02:05:20.626 --> 02:05:23.989]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhancement.
[02:05:24.389 --> 02:05:28.650]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[02:05:29.010 --> 02:05:31.911]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[02:05:32.071 --> 02:05:38.352]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[02:05:38.752 --> 02:05:42.453]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[02:05:42.994 --> 02:05:50.255]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.615 --> 02:05:52.876]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.726 --> 02:06:12.832]  We're going to go right back to David Bailey here in just a few minutes to talk about his powerful new film he's produced, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1.
[02:06:14.053 --> 02:06:24.717]  Learn the incredible secrets of the esoteric traditions hidden within the manifold layers of signs and symbols in our nation's infrastructure, symbols that for many represent the secret destiny of the world's greatest nation.
[02:06:25.874 --> 02:06:27.315]  And why is Washington, D.C.
[02:06:27.355 --> 02:06:29.197]  built on the 77th meridian?
[02:06:30.177 --> 02:06:32.499]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:06:32.579 --> 02:06:35.841]  Why are the Revolutionary War cities really built in perfect alignment with Stonehenge?
[02:06:36.882 --> 02:06:38.844]  I mean, this is serious business, folks.
[02:06:38.884 --> 02:06:42.006]  This is the religion of the elite that run our planet.
[02:06:42.286 --> 02:06:48.791]  As I said on the back of the cover for The Order of Death, my film on this subject, The Satanic Secret Society That Rules the World, Discovered,
[02:06:49.588 --> 02:06:50.209]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:51.990]  Thank you very much for having me on.
[02:06:52.010 --> 02:06:52.390]  It's a pleasure.
[02:07:16.648 --> 02:07:18.769]  Why is filtering your water important, Debbie?
[02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:28.015]  Well, it's really important to have your own personal water filters that you filter it because you just don't know what's going on in the water nowadays.
[02:07:28.615 --> 02:07:42.824]  You know, I mean, besides the chemicals that they put in the city water that are killing us a little bit at a time, we also have the things that are in the air that are getting in that rainwater that people collect and in the ponds and lakes.
[02:07:44.158 --> 02:07:57.449]  So, I mean, you know, in the long run, you really need to filter your water whether or not you are in the city or out in the country, because you just want to have the most healthiest, best drinking water.
[02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:09.999]  Your body consists of 70% water, so it's very important to always have a good source of water, and the Berkey water filters
[02:08:10.586 --> 02:08:20.554]  Are great because one, they don't require any electricity or water pressure and so you can just fill it up and gravity pulls it down and you have great
[02:08:21.147 --> 02:08:23.589]  Drinking water within minutes.
[02:08:23.989 --> 02:08:27.151]  Well, I really believe in this, and this is what I use, what we use at the office.
[02:08:27.211 --> 02:08:31.234]  It's what I give as gifts, birthday presents and things of that nature.
[02:08:31.955 --> 02:08:32.816]  It's so important.
[02:08:32.876 --> 02:08:45.545]  I mean, the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA allow so many chemicals and toxins in our food and water, and water is the greatest thing that we ingest, or at least it should be to be healthy, and it's just so full of poison.
[02:08:45.885 --> 02:08:48.287]  Debbie, tell people about some of the specials you're running right now.
[02:08:48.795 --> 02:08:54.098]  Well, we have a free gift with all of the Berkey water filters for being an Alex Jones listener.
[02:08:54.598 --> 02:09:02.182]  Our filters start at $199 and you can get them as big as you want with as many filters as you want to add on to it.
[02:09:03.523 --> 02:09:09.967]  We're especially excited for the people who've been waiting for a smaller Berkey in stainless steel.
[02:09:09.987 --> 02:09:11.767]  We have the new Berkey Travel.
[02:09:12.588 --> 02:09:16.850]  It's a one and a half gallon stainless steel unit with two black filters in it.
[02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:18.131]  It does accommodate
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:23.004]  The PF2 fluoride filters, if you have fluoride added to your water system.
[02:09:23.925 --> 02:09:30.431]  And so it's a great all-around one for boats, RVs, for people who are in an apartment.
[02:09:30.471 --> 02:09:33.514]  In fact, I just ordered another one of those for the office yesterday.
[02:09:33.694 --> 02:09:34.495]  Yes, you did.
[02:09:34.515 --> 02:09:38.719]  But y'all ordered a big Royal Berkey so that you could have plenty of room...
[02:09:39.259 --> 02:09:41.663]  Wait a minute.
[02:09:41.703 --> 02:09:43.886]  I told Kevin when he was on the phone with you to get the little one.
[02:09:43.926 --> 02:09:44.767]  He got a big one?
[02:09:45.187 --> 02:09:46.930]  Yeah, it was a Royal Berkey.
[02:09:47.050 --> 02:09:47.671]  Yeah, whatever.
[02:09:48.992 --> 02:09:51.696]  That's the type of taskmaster that I am.
[02:09:51.756 --> 02:09:53.619]  Everybody does the opposite, but that's fine.
[02:09:53.879 --> 02:09:55.061]  I don't know where we'll have room for it.
[02:09:55.101 --> 02:09:56.723]  I mean, it's not that big, though.
[02:09:57.441 --> 02:09:58.582]  No, and it hasn't shipped yet.
[02:09:58.622 --> 02:10:07.108]  I mean, I can go ahead and change that if you want, but I think the Royal Berkey will accommodate your people because you have several people in the office, and that way you won't run out.
[02:10:07.148 --> 02:10:09.090]  How many gallons a day does the little one do?
[02:10:09.850 --> 02:10:17.576]  Well, it holds a gallon and a half at a time, and as long as you fill it up and keep it going, it does about a gallon every hour, hour and a half.
[02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:20.338]  One thing neat about the gravity filter is
[02:10:20.828 --> 02:10:25.569]  Is the more full you have the top, and the bigger the top, the faster it goes down into the bottom.
[02:10:25.869 --> 02:10:28.650]  Yeah, give me a favor, change it to the little one.
[02:10:29.010 --> 02:10:29.670]  Okie dokie.
[02:10:29.710 --> 02:10:32.630]  I mean, I've got two in my garage for emergencies boxed up.
[02:10:32.670 --> 02:10:34.331]  If I wanted, I could just bring one of those over.
[02:10:34.351 --> 02:10:34.731]  Okay.
[02:10:34.751 --> 02:10:36.991]  You know, the regular Berkeys, but that's probably my fault.
[02:10:37.031 --> 02:10:37.931]  I probably didn't make it clear.
[02:10:38.311 --> 02:10:42.132]  Yeah, I'll take the little one, the new little one, instead of the Royal.
[02:10:42.152 --> 02:10:42.932]  What's the Royal do?
[02:10:42.992 --> 02:10:43.832]  Three gallons?
[02:10:43.872 --> 02:10:45.493]  The Royal's three and a half gallons.
[02:10:45.513 --> 02:10:46.493]  It's real nice.
[02:10:46.553 --> 02:10:46.773]  Wait!
[02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:48.791]  Yeah, let me look at the order.
[02:10:48.811 --> 02:10:50.613]  I'm positive it was the wrong order.
[02:10:50.633 --> 02:10:53.797]  Not unless we're going to have a horse trough out back.
[02:10:53.817 --> 02:10:57.141]  No, but those are good for restaurants or good for big families.
[02:10:57.161 --> 02:11:01.686]  They are, especially if you're going to cook with it, things like that.
[02:11:01.726 --> 02:11:05.451]  You know, you want to have the bigger ones so you don't run out.
[02:11:06.833 --> 02:11:07.714]  Let me look.
[02:11:07.794 --> 02:11:09.335]  I've got your order right here.
[02:11:09.475 --> 02:11:10.156]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[02:11:11.116 --> 02:11:12.517]  We can figure it out later, Debbie.
[02:11:13.018 --> 02:11:14.899]  What if folks just want to get sports bottles?
[02:11:14.919 --> 02:11:16.320]  Now, they don't cut everything out.
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:23.745]  They just reduce the toxins and poisons and herbicides and pesticides and make it safe to drink and knock out all the bacteria.
[02:11:24.446 --> 02:11:25.787]  Tell us about the deals on those.
[02:11:26.347 --> 02:11:27.127]  We have them.
[02:11:27.448 --> 02:11:31.170]  You can get them individually, the Berkey Sport bottles for $39, or you can get two for $70.
[02:11:33.999 --> 02:11:42.461]  Or if you want the generic labeled ones, which are exactly the same bottle, but we don't have the silk screening put on them, then you can get five for $99.
[02:11:43.581 --> 02:11:50.522]  That's an amazing deal, because they're about $35 in camping supply stores, and so by getting five of them, you save masses of money.
[02:11:50.823 --> 02:11:52.183]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[02:11:52.203 --> 02:11:53.343]  She's a wonderful lady.
[02:11:53.643 --> 02:11:54.783]  Give you a lot of great service.
[02:11:54.803 --> 02:11:54.863]  1-888-803-
[02:11:58.973 --> 02:11:59.093]  4-4-3-8.
[02:11:59.153 --> 02:12:01.035]  They've got shower filters as well.
[02:12:01.435 --> 02:12:05.337]  You absorb a lot of it through your skin or breathe it.
[02:12:05.357 --> 02:12:05.677]  888-803-4438.
[02:12:05.838 --> 02:12:10.120]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com and you can order online.
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:11.521]  Tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[02:12:11.541 --> 02:12:14.063]  Tell them what free gifts you want with your orders.
[02:12:14.083 --> 02:12:15.404]  They've got sheltering in place DVDs.
[02:12:15.424 --> 02:12:17.505]  They've got potassium iodate for nuclear attack.
[02:12:17.805 --> 02:12:19.406]  They've got the sports bottles as free gifts.
[02:12:19.426 --> 02:12:28.853]  888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com or you can order all the same stuff, same price at InfoWars.com as well.
[02:12:29.173 --> 02:12:31.654]  Debbie, thank you so much for taking time out today to join us.
[02:12:32.115 --> 02:12:32.955]  Oh, well, thank you.
[02:12:32.975 --> 02:12:35.437]  I always enjoy it and have a wonderful day.
[02:12:35.737 --> 02:12:37.478]  You too, and we'll talk to you soon.
[02:12:37.498 --> 02:12:38.059]  Thank you.
[02:12:38.809 --> 02:12:45.654]  Folks, I like to have her up at least once a week because they're a great sponsor and they help us with the global shortwave to reach the entire planet without outreach.
[02:12:45.794 --> 02:12:46.875]  And it's made in America.
[02:12:47.255 --> 02:12:47.855]  And I use it.
[02:12:47.955 --> 02:12:48.556]  I believe in it.
[02:12:48.576 --> 02:12:50.837]  I only promote what I believe in, what I know to be good.
[02:12:52.158 --> 02:12:54.240]  They're the national distributor and the national maker.
[02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:58.822]  So, you're getting the equivalent discount of somebody who's ordering 50 of these.
[02:12:59.342 --> 02:13:01.483]  Go buy a Big Berkey at the store.
[02:13:01.523 --> 02:13:03.084]  It's $300 for a little one.
[02:13:03.104 --> 02:13:04.464]  $350, $400 for a big one.
[02:13:04.884 --> 02:13:06.785]  You can get them for $199, $249.
[02:13:07.546 --> 02:13:08.366]  Shave a lot of money.
[02:13:08.466 --> 02:13:09.086]  Go through her.
[02:13:09.546 --> 02:13:12.248]  I'm telling you.
[02:13:12.268 --> 02:13:12.428]  888-803-4438.
[02:13:12.828 --> 02:13:13.708]  Okay, back to David Bay.
[02:13:13.748 --> 02:13:14.589]  David, thanks for holding.
[02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:15.589]  Thanks for holding, listeners.
[02:13:15.929 --> 02:13:19.071]  That's just an important announcement information for people we do once a week.
[02:13:20.749 --> 02:13:22.350]  David, let's get into the architecture.
[02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:27.633]  We know there's this ruling elite, helped found America, more sinister group, hijacked it around 1770... 1786.
[02:13:28.554 --> 02:13:38.919]  Yeah, well, I know it was founded in 1776, but the hijacking, it took them a few years to get that done.
[02:13:38.939 --> 02:13:46.284]  Like I said, it took them only 13 years to grab control of all the Masonic Lodges in Europe.
[02:13:46.664 --> 02:13:50.186]  A few more years after that, it grabbed control of Britain, and then...
[02:13:51.031 --> 02:14:01.517]  Once the Founding Fathers passed away, then the VSOF brand of Illuminism began to take over American lodges.
[02:14:01.617 --> 02:14:13.384]  Probably by the William Morgan murder affair, the lodges had been turned over in America to the Illuminist lodges.
[02:14:13.977 --> 02:14:23.446]  Get into the William Morgan murder that then caused the anti-Masonic party, and tell us about that a little bit, and then let's get into the architecture.
[02:14:24.167 --> 02:14:25.849]  All right.
[02:14:26.329 --> 02:14:33.196]  The William Morgan affair reveals, in my opinion, it reveals the true nature of Freemasonry.
[02:14:33.856 --> 02:14:35.478]  Not because three guys...
[02:14:38.488 --> 02:14:39.870]  ...murdered William Morgan.
[02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:45.998]  Because Freemasonry was a large organization that had tens of thousands of members at the time in America.
[02:14:46.478 --> 02:14:50.023]  And any organization of that size can have three...
[02:14:51.423 --> 02:14:54.604]  Crackpots pop up and murder somebody.
[02:14:54.624 --> 02:15:01.107]  And, of course, that's what Freemasonry tried to say, was that these guys weren't representative of what Masonry's all about.
[02:15:01.127 --> 02:15:08.830]  They literally took these horrible... The point was the national cover-up.
[02:15:09.530 --> 02:15:12.091]  Yeah, the cover-up was the issue.
[02:15:12.511 --> 02:15:20.534]  I mean, when this affair began to get out into the open, people began to press for the...
[02:15:21.201 --> 02:15:21.721]  We're good to go.
[02:15:37.368 --> 02:15:38.850]  And they covered it up.
[02:15:39.070 --> 02:15:42.173]  They refused to launch the investigation.
[02:15:42.373 --> 02:15:53.062]  And that's the scandal in England right now that's in all the mainstream papers in the last four years is almost all the judges, the politicians, they can get away with murder literally now today.
[02:15:53.403 --> 02:15:56.105]  Well, you know, in the upper levels of the York right, you know...
[02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:07.414]  You know, a mason, you know, vows that he will cover the crimes of a fellow mason, even including treason and murder.
[02:16:08.294 --> 02:16:21.080]  So you just can't, you should, there should be a law, Alex, against any free mason holding any office, because their goals are not the goals of American democracy.
[02:16:21.946 --> 02:16:22.927]  They're simply not.
[02:16:23.107 --> 02:16:24.649]  Well, they're not the goals of this republic.
[02:16:24.669 --> 02:16:26.310]  You're absolutely right about that.
[02:16:27.671 --> 02:16:33.696]  So, in the last minute of this segment, then we'll get into the architecture, break down what ended up happening in that affair.
[02:16:34.937 --> 02:16:37.540]  Well, William was murdered.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:42.944]  The authorities were pressed to launch an investigation, which they absolutely refused to do.
[02:16:43.665 --> 02:16:46.908]  And once one of the perpetrators...
[02:16:47.797 --> 02:16:49.058]  We're good to go.
[02:17:08.064 --> 02:17:11.505]  We'll be right back and get into the architecture, I promise, with our guests.
[02:17:11.625 --> 02:17:17.708]  We'll also play that little History Channel clip about the Hellfire Club and the satanic rituals and Benjamin Franklin.
[02:17:17.728 --> 02:17:20.749]  And we'll take more of your calls on the other side.
[02:17:34.933 --> 02:17:35.915]  Be sure and stay with us.
[02:17:36.095 --> 02:17:36.876]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:36.896 --> 02:17:38.819]  We're talking to David Bay of Cutting Edge Ministries.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:41.602]  And the new film is a must-see.
[02:17:42.123 --> 02:17:43.104]  America's Beginnings.
[02:17:43.124 --> 02:17:44.146]  You need to have it.
[02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:47.312]  Come on, Bill.
[02:17:47.532 --> 02:17:49.352]  Two weeks ago, you were riding the bicycle.
[02:17:49.552 --> 02:17:52.713]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:17:53.034 --> 02:17:53.594]  What did you do?
[02:17:53.714 --> 02:17:54.534]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:17:54.614 --> 02:17:55.334]  No, John.
[02:17:55.354 --> 02:17:56.615]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:17:56.875 --> 02:18:02.417]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:18:02.677 --> 02:18:08.959]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:18:09.279 --> 02:18:11.480]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:12.400]  And get this.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.641]  They guaranteed my success in writing.
[02:18:15.161 --> 02:18:18.603]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:18:18.843 --> 02:18:19.243]  Whoa.
[02:18:19.643 --> 02:18:20.844]  What was that website again?
[02:18:20.924 --> 02:18:24.425]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:18:24.725 --> 02:18:25.826]  Now write this down, John.
[02:18:25.966 --> 02:18:30.268]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:18:30.408 --> 02:18:30.988]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:18:31.268 --> 02:18:32.468]  I'm going there right now.
[02:18:32.869 --> 02:18:33.529]  Check, please.
[02:18:35.292 --> 02:18:36.753]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:18:37.233 --> 02:18:37.833]  Sure, John.
[02:18:38.054 --> 02:18:42.436]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:18:42.736 --> 02:18:44.437]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:18:44.597 --> 02:18:44.857]  Deal.
[02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:48.727]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.127 --> 02:18:54.612]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.192 --> 02:18:55.693]  That's right.
[02:18:55.993 --> 02:18:58.295]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.615 --> 02:19:05.781]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.323 --> 02:19:14.035]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.476 --> 02:19:19.283]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.933 --> 02:19:24.958]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.759 --> 02:19:29.903]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.264 --> 02:19:30.504]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.524 --> 02:19:32.466]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.546 --> 02:19:32.846]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.147 --> 02:19:33.407]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.962 --> 02:19:48.845]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:19:49.205 --> 02:19:52.087]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:19:52.307 --> 02:19:58.513]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:19:58.873 --> 02:20:06.199]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:20:06.379 --> 02:20:10.463]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[02:21:28.848 --> 02:21:29.909]  Or call 888-216-2461.
[02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:30.150]  That's 888-216-2461.
[02:21:58.753 --> 02:22:02.457]  Bill, Melissa, Sally, Brock, Mark, coming up in the next segment, we'll go right to your calls.
[02:22:02.477 --> 02:22:11.725]  My guest, David Bay, Cutting Edge Ministries, talking about his new film, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, The New Atlantis.
[02:22:12.986 --> 02:22:14.307]  Let's get into the architecture.
[02:22:14.767 --> 02:22:22.314]  I mean, last year I had a big professor and scholar who was all over major newspapers in...
[02:22:23.354 --> 02:22:36.278]  Canada, and he'd caught them building government buildings, the parliament, according to 666, the sun calculation, having the rooms set up with actually the ritualistic altars in plain view.
[02:22:36.378 --> 02:22:40.919]  These are really temples built on certain meridians, certain lines.
[02:22:41.399 --> 02:22:45.561]  And when he went and talked to the people who designed them, the architects, they said, yeah, okay, it's a cultic.
[02:22:45.941 --> 02:22:46.561]  Now shut up.
[02:22:47.250 --> 02:22:50.833]  So this is mainstream, but a lot of people aren't aware.
[02:22:50.893 --> 02:22:51.854]  Tell us about the capital.
[02:22:51.894 --> 02:22:53.195]  Tell us about these eastern cities.
[02:22:54.516 --> 02:22:58.799]  Well, you know, Freemasons have been doing this for over a thousand years.
[02:22:59.379 --> 02:23:02.041]  They did it in Europe, they did it in Great Britain, and they did it in the United States.
[02:23:02.482 --> 02:23:05.644]  They did it in South America, they did it in Australia, etc.
[02:23:05.804 --> 02:23:06.265]  It's all over.
[02:23:07.426 --> 02:23:14.271]  What they really... See, the five American cities that are built in line with each other and with Stonehenge...
[02:23:16.002 --> 02:23:21.985]  Are on a ley line, L-E-Y line, ley line.
[02:23:22.565 --> 02:23:27.046]  And a ley line, you'll find no reference to it in any scientific journals.
[02:23:27.527 --> 02:23:29.747]  It's strictly an occult concept.
[02:23:30.348 --> 02:23:35.410]  They believe that the Earth is crisscrossed by these ley lines.
[02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:37.871]  Of course, the most obvious ley line is the equator.
[02:23:38.271 --> 02:23:39.551]  But there are many ley lines, some...
[02:23:42.057 --> 02:23:46.519]  Some, you know, going, you know, crisscrossing each other at rather strange angles.
[02:23:47.120 --> 02:24:03.929]  But they believe that the world reverberates with occult power and, you know, they follow established lines, which they call ley lines, just as an electrical current would follow
[02:24:04.605 --> 02:24:06.986]  A circuit.
[02:24:07.187 --> 02:24:08.967]  They believe in places of power.
[02:24:09.388 --> 02:24:11.049]  Yeah, places of power.
[02:24:11.189 --> 02:24:20.874]  And like Bill Schnebelin says on our video, if you're an occultist, you build things on ley lines.
[02:24:21.174 --> 02:24:24.656]  You build cities and you build monuments on ley lines.
[02:24:25.236 --> 02:24:33.001]  And so, you know, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston are all...
[02:24:34.028 --> 02:24:46.758]  On the ley line, which, you know, is at a 52-degree azimuth, when you extend that line across the Atlantic Ocean, you run right smack dab through the middle of Stonehenge.
[02:24:46.818 --> 02:24:48.859]  I mean, it is a zero deviation.
[02:24:48.919 --> 02:24:50.460]  It goes right through the middle.
[02:24:50.981 --> 02:24:53.903]  Now, Boston was originally founded in 1630.
[02:24:54.964 --> 02:25:00.227]  So that means that, you know, in Francis Bacon, you know, his official death is listed as 1626.
[02:25:02.845 --> 02:25:16.153]  So, you know, you just have to understand, you know, that it's probable that the location of the five American cities was, you know, being aligned with each other and being aligned with Stonehenge was part of the Baconian plan.
[02:25:16.633 --> 02:25:19.035]  Now, then we look at the actual architecture itself.
[02:25:20.436 --> 02:25:29.101]  Yeah, the architecture itself is just full of the symbols, the geometric symbols of
[02:25:29.634 --> 02:25:53.697]  That, you know, occultist love, you know, pyramids, you know, triangles, you know what I mean, triangles, squares, and circles, pentagrams, hexagrams, you know, the, you know, the, you know, the,
[02:25:56.310 --> 02:26:08.518]  The Freemasons square compass and rule are shown in the street design between the White House and the Capitol building.
[02:26:09.118 --> 02:26:13.762]  The whole thing is set up as a huge occultic playground, really.
[02:26:13.862 --> 02:26:14.642]  It's more than that.
[02:26:14.662 --> 02:26:17.744]  From the occult point of view, it's got a very definite reason for
[02:26:26.009 --> 02:26:27.251]  For being built this way.
[02:26:27.271 --> 02:26:35.942]  You see, the occultists believe that it's important to put a symbol on the
[02:26:41.386 --> 02:26:42.207]  On a building.
[02:26:42.247 --> 02:26:43.128]  Yeah, it's markers.
[02:26:43.508 --> 02:26:50.353]  Well, no, they believe that that symbol begins to reverberate with occult power 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:26:50.674 --> 02:26:51.534]  That's a resonance.
[02:26:51.735 --> 02:26:56.959]  Yeah, it draws... You know, I had one former Satanist tell me that it's like a...
[02:26:57.594 --> 02:27:10.799]  You know, it's like a transfer of PowerPoint, where the power comes from the other dimension through this symbol on the ground or through this symbol on the side of a building and comes into this dimension.
[02:27:10.839 --> 02:27:18.642]  Yeah, they've got to have the all-seeing eyes, the pyramids, the symbols on everything they do because they believe that they're going to have a disaster if they don't.
[02:27:19.202 --> 02:27:25.846]  Yeah, well, or at least they believe that the New World Order will be further enhanced by this power that's coming through these various symbols.
[02:27:25.926 --> 02:27:32.389]  All right, we're going to come back right to your calls with David Bay talking about the new film, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings.
[02:27:32.970 --> 02:27:33.450]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.111 --> 02:27:36.992]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.492 --> 02:27:39.093]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.013 --> 02:27:42.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:58.822 --> 02:29:03.486]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:03.966 --> 02:29:10.694]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.075 --> 02:29:22.889]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.329 --> 02:29:23.750]  We're good to go.

[02:30:52.793 --> 02:30:55.134]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:55.334 --> 02:30:58.594]  We've got about 27 minutes left and a lot of news I haven't even gotten to.
[02:30:58.614 --> 02:31:01.415]  But I want to go through these calls, patient people have been holding for David Bay.
[02:31:01.995 --> 02:31:07.716]  I appreciate him joining us today and I'm really impressed with the film that he's produced and with his director.
[02:31:07.756 --> 02:31:08.436]  You need to get it.
[02:31:08.456 --> 02:31:10.416]  I can't wait to see the other volumes when they produce those.
[02:31:10.836 --> 02:31:14.117]  Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 1, The New Atlantis.
[02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:25.856]  Learn the incredible secrets of the esoteric traditions hidden within the manifold layers of signs and symbols in our nation's infrastructure, symbols that for many represent the secret destiny of the world's greatest nation.
[02:31:26.196 --> 02:31:30.038]  And when you buy America's Beginnings, you get two of my films for $14.95.
[02:31:30.899 --> 02:31:32.760]  You get The Order of Death and then the updated...
[02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:34.221]  We're good to go.
[02:32:03.286 --> 02:32:05.086]  Okay, thank you, Alex and David.
[02:32:06.006 --> 02:32:14.028]  Many years ago, when I taught in public school, I used the writings of an author by the name of Solange Hertz.
[02:32:14.728 --> 02:32:17.368]  Have you ever heard of her, David?
[02:32:18.249 --> 02:32:18.829]  No, I haven't.
[02:32:19.069 --> 02:32:32.931]  Okay, well, she writes from a Catholic perspective, and I use these in public schools, and what she essentially brought out was everything that you've been talking about today.
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:44.284]  And she based it upon the encyclicals of the popes prior to the Catholic Church being subverted as it is today.
[02:32:45.024 --> 02:32:50.587]  So all of the information that you're talking about, the Church warred against it.
[02:32:51.147 --> 02:32:58.990]  In fact, Albert Pike, in his book, Morals and Dogma, talked about how the monarchies of Europe
[02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:05.386]  And the Catholic Church, namely the papal throne, had to be overthrown.
[02:33:06.021 --> 02:33:07.842]  Before all this could be accomplished.
[02:33:07.922 --> 02:33:12.025]  Well, yeah, that was what the... I mean, whether people like the Catholics or dislike them, that's a new point.
[02:33:12.085 --> 02:33:17.729]  It is admitted that the Illuminati's main war, they said, was against the royals and the church.
[02:33:17.769 --> 02:33:21.031]  David, does that go along with your research?
[02:33:21.331 --> 02:33:21.852]  Absolutely.
[02:33:21.952 --> 02:33:33.860]  I mean, the Jesuits were formed in the mid-1500s to try to return the supremacy of Rome in the areas of...
[02:33:34.927 --> 02:33:41.509]  All right, one other item that I'd like to point out is that you talk about how Washington and some of the founders
[02:34:01.574 --> 02:34:05.056]  took an approach where they were opposing Adam Weishaupt.
[02:34:05.576 --> 02:34:08.498]  But, you know, it's like the Fabian Socialists.
[02:34:08.918 --> 02:34:13.280]  We're going to arrive at the same point at a point in history.
[02:34:13.781 --> 02:34:23.886]  And you've also pointed out how over the years the Masons themselves have covered up what the Illuminists have done.
[02:34:24.466 --> 02:34:26.967]  So we're going to end up with this creation.
[02:34:27.027 --> 02:34:28.648]  Now, whether we do it violently...
[02:34:30.179 --> 02:34:37.686]  Adam Weishaupt or whether we do it gradually in a Fabian Socialist way, it doesn't matter.
[02:34:38.627 --> 02:34:40.068]  One last item.
[02:34:40.288 --> 02:34:41.809]  Alex, you got me going.
[02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:45.252]  I got elected town board chairman last April.
[02:34:45.793 --> 02:34:47.254]  I'm still in that position.
[02:34:47.535 --> 02:34:48.415]  I am now.
[02:34:48.676 --> 02:34:54.561]  I got elected two Tuesdays ago as the county board supervisor.
[02:34:55.183 --> 02:35:07.872]  And I'm going to get on law enforcement committees, social services, look into psychotropic drugs, look into the connection of the police state to our local sheriff's office.
[02:35:09.253 --> 02:35:11.435]  I commend you for everything that you do.
[02:35:12.128 --> 02:35:17.534]  And there's a lot of people out there that could do the same thing that an old geezer like me could do.
[02:35:18.576 --> 02:35:22.380]  You can turn around your local government and expose a lot of this.
[02:35:22.460 --> 02:35:25.344]  Bill, I appreciate your call, and it's exciting what you've done.
[02:35:25.524 --> 02:35:26.164]  Absolutely.
[02:35:26.385 --> 02:35:30.750]  So many people say we can't affect change, we can't get involved, we can't help anything.
[02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:44.038]  You know, David Bay, you're a degree from college, Army Intelligence, Vietnam, of course a Baptist yourself, teach Sunday school, the whole nine yards.
[02:35:44.458 --> 02:35:49.381]  Looking at the modern dominant church today, I don't care, the Catholics, the Protestants, the whatever.
[02:35:49.921 --> 02:35:54.886]  They're all, the big dominant churches, pushing this New World Order as well, or almost all.
[02:35:55.587 --> 02:36:01.733]  What is it like to see so-called Christians out there saying, lay down, go along with the New World Order, we're going to get raptured out of here?
[02:36:02.613 --> 02:36:04.035]  Well, it's heart-rending.
[02:36:04.155 --> 02:36:09.760]  I mean, they've all been lulled to sleep.
[02:36:09.981 --> 02:36:10.881]  And you're right.
[02:36:13.177 --> 02:36:18.403]  I believe the rapture of the church to be a real doctrine that's taught.
[02:36:18.423 --> 02:36:19.124]  I believe in that.
[02:36:19.885 --> 02:36:29.117]  But this idea that we're going to be living in clover one day and raptured out the next day and then the bad stuff happens.
[02:36:29.737 --> 02:36:35.340]  I think that's a tenant from hell, because it's just lowly people asleep.
[02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:40.403]  Exactly, but whatever the truth is, I know I've got a job to fight evil.
[02:36:40.843 --> 02:36:41.423]  Absolutely.
[02:36:41.924 --> 02:36:42.324]  Absolutely.
[02:36:42.344 --> 02:36:43.024]  You've got to fight it.
[02:36:43.044 --> 02:36:44.785]  You've got to get involved.
[02:36:44.825 --> 02:36:55.611]  You've got to use the knowledge you have that Cutting Edge Ministries and Alex Jones puts out there to make the kind of changes that this guy just...
[02:36:56.261 --> 02:36:56.721]  Described.
[02:36:57.121 --> 02:36:57.822]  Exactly.
[02:36:58.102 --> 02:36:59.503]  Let's talk to Melissa in Texas.
[02:36:59.543 --> 02:37:00.583]  Thanks for holding, Melissa.
[02:37:01.424 --> 02:37:02.024]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:02.504 --> 02:37:02.784]  Hi.
[02:37:03.385 --> 02:37:04.245]  Is there an echo?
[02:37:05.225 --> 02:37:06.066]  There is an echo.
[02:37:06.106 --> 02:37:07.887]  I don't know if that's our phone system or your phone.
[02:37:07.927 --> 02:37:08.287]  Go ahead.
[02:37:08.307 --> 02:37:08.947]  Okay.
[02:37:08.967 --> 02:37:16.551]  The question I have would be, David, do you talk about the Jeffersonian Bible?
[02:37:19.613 --> 02:37:22.534]  We don't cover the Jeffersonian Bible in this video, but
[02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:28.744]  Jefferson tried to demystify the New Testament.
[02:37:31.567 --> 02:37:36.390]  I think he took out all the miracles and anything that couldn't be explained by natural process.
[02:37:37.191 --> 02:37:38.452]  Well, he got rid of Paul.
[02:37:39.733 --> 02:37:39.933]  Yeah.
[02:37:40.493 --> 02:37:41.394]  The Apostle Paul.
[02:37:41.434 --> 02:37:44.897]  Without the Apostle Paul... You don't have a church.
[02:37:45.457 --> 02:37:45.857]  That's right.
[02:37:46.218 --> 02:37:46.918]  Yeah.
[02:37:46.938 --> 02:37:51.722]  See, Jefferson was one of the founding fathers who's...
[02:37:53.610 --> 02:37:59.596]  Whose vision was tilted more toward the Beesoft model than the Baconian model.
[02:38:00.497 --> 02:38:03.940]  He defended Beesoft as being harmless.
[02:38:04.361 --> 02:38:11.088]  And it's not surprising that he would make this kind of an attack on the Bible.
[02:38:11.888 --> 02:38:15.372]  But, you know, New Agers and occultists of all stripes...
[02:38:15.891 --> 02:38:17.112]  Hate the Apostle Paul.
[02:38:17.452 --> 02:38:26.375]  They uniformly denounce him and try to debunk him and completely discredit him.
[02:38:26.395 --> 02:38:28.616]  Yeah, you know it's the devil when they go after Paul.
[02:38:29.116 --> 02:38:29.877]  Exactly right.
[02:38:30.357 --> 02:38:32.138]  They're going to have some explaining to do.
[02:38:33.338 --> 02:38:36.479]  Oh yeah, well there's a judgment day for all these people.
[02:38:36.519 --> 02:38:37.600]  Anything else, Melissa?
[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:40.321]  Just God bless you both in the name of God.
[02:38:41.007 --> 02:38:42.228]  His son, Jesus Christ.
[02:38:42.448 --> 02:38:43.288]  All right, thank you.
[02:38:43.328 --> 02:38:44.829]  That phone's really bad.
[02:38:44.849 --> 02:38:46.049]  I hope that's not our system.
[02:38:46.529 --> 02:38:47.790]  We'll find out when we take another call.
[02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:49.471]  Sally, you're on the air.
[02:38:49.491 --> 02:38:50.491]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:38:50.691 --> 02:38:51.712]  Yeah, it's from Florida.
[02:38:51.992 --> 02:38:52.452]  Welcome.
[02:38:52.692 --> 02:39:10.400]  I just got a newsletter from a pastor you've had on your program, Pastor Butch, and he said that they just had a meeting March 23rd in Ohio where the FEMA is going around to the churches trying to get their pastors to get their parishioners to submit to detention centers.
[02:39:11.309 --> 02:39:13.872]  Yeah, and the forced vaccination and the rest of it.
[02:39:14.213 --> 02:39:15.034]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:15.094 --> 02:39:21.221]  In fact, David, that's been in mainstream news that now FEMA's building these emergency camps for our safety.
[02:39:22.322 --> 02:39:26.587]  Right, but it's particularly ominous if they're going to the pastors.
[02:39:26.627 --> 02:39:29.730]  I heard this a couple of weeks ago.
[02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:32.093]  I haven't been able to get any confirmation on it, but
[02:39:33.709 --> 02:39:34.649]  But I heard it.
[02:39:34.669 --> 02:39:41.112]  If they're coming to the pastors now, we're now moving into a very dangerous phase.
[02:39:41.873 --> 02:39:51.558]  The Nazis did this in the late 30s, about 37, just about a year and a half before they actually started moving against the Jews in an open way.
[02:39:52.578 --> 02:39:52.779]  They...
[02:39:56.098 --> 02:40:08.287]  They paid visits to various pastors to get them to start spying on the congregations and to get them to working in parallel with the Nazi Party.
[02:40:08.467 --> 02:40:12.610]  Well, it's admitted that Homeland Security and Army Intelligence and Defense Intelligence
[02:40:13.090 --> 02:40:14.551]  You know, there's such an attack on property rights.
[02:40:14.571 --> 02:40:17.793]  Not only from that manual, but from the Supreme Court decision that
[02:40:36.983 --> 02:40:49.486]  That a city can seize, you know, by imminent domain, any property, any privately held property, if they believe they could get more taxes from a development coming in there.
[02:40:49.806 --> 02:40:50.686]  It's unbelievable.
[02:40:50.706 --> 02:40:54.447]  Private property is just under attack like never before.
[02:40:54.767 --> 02:40:55.607]  I agree with you.
[02:40:55.647 --> 02:40:56.088]  Brock.
[02:40:56.528 --> 02:40:59.808]  Brock, where are you calling us from?
[02:41:00.249 --> 02:41:01.369]  Knoxville, Tennessee.
[02:41:01.609 --> 02:41:01.969]  Welcome.
[02:41:04.009 --> 02:41:04.950]  I'm working.
[02:41:05.050 --> 02:41:06.390]  I've been waiting for like an hour, but...
[02:41:07.665 --> 02:41:08.606]  Well, you're on the air now.
[02:41:08.666 --> 02:41:09.486]  Make it count, brother.
[02:41:11.187 --> 02:41:14.089]  I've been listening to you since, oh, 98 or so.
[02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:17.711]  But anyway, I thank you for all you're doing and everything.
[02:41:17.991 --> 02:41:18.492]  Well, thank you.
[02:41:18.632 --> 02:41:25.056]  I just want to make a comment about the ideology of world government.
[02:41:25.556 --> 02:41:31.119]  And I think it goes back farther than 1776 with Adam Weishaupt.
[02:41:31.159 --> 02:41:35.682]  I think it goes all the way back to Babylon and the Tower of Babel.
[02:41:36.394 --> 02:41:36.935]  Absolutely.
[02:41:37.875 --> 02:41:42.158]  That's the one world merging of all the cultures.
[02:41:43.059 --> 02:41:52.986]  This whole current system moving toward this new world order is in reality a Tower of Babel revisited.
[02:41:53.807 --> 02:41:54.287]  Absolutely.
[02:41:54.307 --> 02:41:55.148]  You hit it right on the head.
[02:41:55.848 --> 02:41:56.209]  Exactly.
[02:41:58.450 --> 02:42:04.095]  I didn't learn that anywhere but from being in the Word of God and praying and
[02:42:05.336 --> 02:42:08.458]  And talking to the Lord about the whole situation.
[02:42:08.858 --> 02:42:12.359]  I've always been one to want to know why things are the way they are.
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:14.460]  Well, he told me.
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:20.543]  But anyway, that's all I wanted to comment about as far as that goes.
[02:42:21.383 --> 02:42:23.004]  And I'll just hang up and listen.
[02:42:23.224 --> 02:42:23.765]  Thank you, sir.
[02:42:23.805 --> 02:42:24.705]  I appreciate the call.
[02:42:24.725 --> 02:42:26.846]  You want to comment on that and we'll take one final call, David?
[02:42:27.086 --> 02:42:30.668]  Well, the Freemasons and occultists of all stripes...
[02:42:31.576 --> 02:42:35.879]  Do trace their roots back to ancient Egypt and ancient Babylon.
[02:42:35.899 --> 02:42:37.300]  Yeah, the Babylon Mystery Schools.
[02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:38.501]  Absolutely.
[02:42:38.661 --> 02:42:39.161]  Absolutely.
[02:42:39.181 --> 02:42:45.086]  That's the core of Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Skull and Bones, all of the secret societies.
[02:42:45.166 --> 02:42:48.428]  It's all based upon this Luciferian worship.
[02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.989]  Absolutely.
[02:42:50.029 --> 02:42:50.830]  Let's take a call.
[02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:51.450]  Final call.
[02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:52.951]  Angela in California.
[02:42:53.252 --> 02:42:54.092]  Go ahead, Angela.
[02:42:54.552 --> 02:42:55.153]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:55.906 --> 02:42:58.428]  Can I make a comment on the immigration thing?
[02:42:58.708 --> 02:42:59.369]  Anything you'd like.
[02:42:59.409 --> 02:42:59.769]  Go ahead.
[02:43:00.069 --> 02:43:03.352]  Listen, I'm really glad that you started your show with that today.
[02:43:04.993 --> 02:43:08.095]  The whole thing has got to be a huge scam.
[02:43:08.235 --> 02:43:12.158]  Well, it goes back to getting rid of the borders, merging the cultures.
[02:43:12.178 --> 02:43:13.019]  It's the same thing.
[02:43:13.359 --> 02:43:14.800]  They could not have done this, Alex.
[02:43:14.900 --> 02:43:18.063]  Look, these people supposedly come here because they're so poor.
[02:43:18.443 --> 02:43:22.286]  They just want to find some under-minimum wage job to feed their families.
[02:43:22.839 --> 02:43:24.059]  So they don't have laptops.
[02:43:24.140 --> 02:43:26.620]  Half of them don't even speak English, okay?
[02:43:27.021 --> 02:43:31.302]  How in the heck do you organize and coordinate something like this?
[02:43:31.342 --> 02:43:32.603]  Well, ma'am, let me give you the answer.
[02:43:32.683 --> 02:43:34.503]  I mean, you obviously heard the first hour of the show.
[02:43:34.563 --> 02:43:35.444]  It's not debatable.
[02:43:35.724 --> 02:43:36.924]  We have the smoking gun.
[02:43:37.624 --> 02:43:50.309]  Fox hired Bush's big lobbying firm out of Dallas and openly said, we're going to stage all this with the media and protest to defeat this legislation, to control the borders, and to make these people felons.
[02:43:50.989 --> 02:43:54.692]  What we are seeing here, and here's the dirty little secret, NAFTA is being formed.
[02:44:11.977 --> 02:44:13.578]  You remember NAFTA, right, Alex?
[02:44:13.778 --> 02:44:14.538]  Yeah.
[02:44:14.558 --> 02:44:17.380]  1993, I mean, George H.W.
[02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:20.061]  Bush started the move toward NAFTA.
[02:44:20.141 --> 02:44:21.642]  Clinton finished it, right?
[02:44:22.422 --> 02:44:27.064]  Western Europe was founded on December 31, 1992.
[02:44:27.625 --> 02:44:40.671]  Now, NAFTA was created as an economic union with the understanding that just like Western Europe has done since 1992, NAFTA would begin to become a single nation.
[02:44:41.318 --> 02:44:47.920]  We are seeing the people of America, Mexico, and Canada about to become NAFTA citizens.
[02:44:48.541 --> 02:44:50.261]  And that's the dirty little secret.
[02:44:50.782 --> 02:44:51.622]  And that's the truth.
[02:44:51.662 --> 02:44:52.882]  That's the official documents.
[02:44:52.942 --> 02:44:54.003]  That's the legislation.
[02:44:54.043 --> 02:44:54.743]  That's the treaties.
[02:44:54.783 --> 02:44:55.623]  That's the agreements.
[02:44:55.963 --> 02:44:56.364]  Absolutely.
[02:44:56.404 --> 02:44:58.624]  And then people see all these illegal aliens running around.
[02:44:58.664 --> 02:45:01.165]  This was all staged by our government in Mexico, and it's admitted.
[02:45:01.185 --> 02:45:02.846]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I...
[02:45:03.689 --> 02:45:10.453]  You know, whenever you see mass spontaneous demonstrations, you just have to assume they're staged.
[02:45:10.514 --> 02:45:12.695]  It's a government provocateur operation.
[02:45:12.955 --> 02:45:18.899]  Exactly, but everybody says they're staged from instinct, and we have the proof here, and for three weeks I didn't think of this.
[02:45:19.119 --> 02:45:32.368]  And then I went, wait a minute, Vicente Fox was going to hire Bush's big PR firm, the guy that got Bush in, the guy that got Fox in, to run this propaganda campaign, and they said they'd do this, and they've done it, and the media acts like it's spontaneous when it's a PR firm.
[02:45:32.728 --> 02:45:33.588]  Right, of course.
[02:45:33.828 --> 02:45:42.450]  You know, just last week, Bush of the United States, Fox of Mexico, and Barbara, I think his name is, of Canada... Met down in Cancun.
[02:45:42.871 --> 02:45:44.071]  Met down in Cancun.
[02:45:44.091 --> 02:45:54.533]  Now, just before they met, Congress starts considering this very draconian bill to make the illegal immigrants felons.
[02:45:54.814 --> 02:46:00.375]  So, of course, this makes the immigrants mad, and so the spontaneous...
[02:46:01.108 --> 02:46:04.390]  Demonstrations pop out at the time of the... That's a key point.
[02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:05.410]  That's a key point.
[02:46:05.610 --> 02:46:08.571]  The timing is too cute by half.
[02:46:09.452 --> 02:46:12.953]  Sure, sure, but that's a point I haven't made, but I thought that, and I think you're right.
[02:46:13.273 --> 02:46:19.756]  They brought the legislation the American people have been demanding for decades up right during the PR campaign, knowing it would be a collision.
[02:46:20.196 --> 02:46:21.877]  Absolutely, and wanting the collision.
[02:46:26.655 --> 02:46:27.856]  David, you're absolutely right.
[02:46:28.196 --> 02:46:30.676]  In closing here, we've got about a minute and a half left.
[02:46:30.716 --> 02:46:37.378]  I hope people will go to Infowars.com and the video and bookstore and get Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, The New Atlantis.
[02:46:37.739 --> 02:46:42.700]  Tell folks, again, just in a nutshell, well, let's play this Hellfire Club clip one more time.
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:45.281]  This is from, I mean, I promised to play this.
[02:46:45.661 --> 02:46:51.703]  This is from the History Channel just a few years ago, admitting the satanic activities of Benjamin Franklin.
[02:46:51.723 --> 02:46:52.043]  Here it is.
[02:46:52.883 --> 02:46:59.330]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[02:47:03.193 --> 02:47:16.265]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and mocking its sacred rituals.
[02:47:17.669 --> 02:47:22.431]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[02:47:23.412 --> 02:47:29.334]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[02:47:30.375 --> 02:47:31.535]  Well, that's a good way to close.
[02:47:31.596 --> 02:47:33.837]  David Bay, I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:36.078]  We have links to your site up on Infowars.com.
[02:47:36.098 --> 02:47:37.938]  Again, we are carrying your new film.
[02:47:38.639 --> 02:47:40.059]  Why do people need to get this video?
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:41.720]  Absolutely.
[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:43.221]  If you want to understand...
[02:47:44.905 --> 02:47:47.367]  The present, you must go back to the past.
[02:47:47.907 --> 02:47:49.048]  And that's what this video does.
[02:47:49.348 --> 02:47:55.534]  It's a rollicking good story, and it just teaches so many things that people have to know today.
[02:47:56.234 --> 02:47:58.376]  Well, it's something that's going to wake up a lot of people.
[02:47:58.436 --> 02:48:00.918]  And again, I commend you and your director for the fine work.
[02:48:01.158 --> 02:48:02.399]  When will Volume 2 be out?
[02:48:03.040 --> 02:48:05.042]  We are planning for it to be out in late September.
[02:48:05.962 --> 02:48:08.024]  Okay, and so you're going to have a new volume every six months?
[02:48:08.765 --> 02:48:10.967]  We are going to have a new volume every six months.
[02:48:11.387 --> 02:48:12.428]  Four volumes are planned.
[02:48:13.121 --> 02:48:19.903]  All right, well, I want to end up carrying all four volumes, and as soon as the second volume comes out, give me a call so I'll be sure and carry it.
[02:48:19.943 --> 02:48:20.504]  God bless you.
[02:48:20.784 --> 02:48:21.304]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:21.344 --> 02:48:21.964]  God bless you, too.
[02:48:22.064 --> 02:48:22.724]  Take care, my friends.
[02:48:23.284 --> 02:48:34.708]  Okay, we'll be right back, and then I'll have a kind of news roundup, some recap of headlines, and then some other stuff we have ahead on, kind of a little news blitz for you on the other side of this quick break.
[02:48:34.728 --> 02:48:40.330]  So stay with us, stay the course, come in for the big finish, and then we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:48:40.390 --> 02:48:42.371]  But we'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:48:46.593 --> 02:48:49.534]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.195 --> 02:48:51.495]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.695 --> 02:48:57.438]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:07.362]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:07.662 --> 02:49:09.443]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:49:09.503 --> 02:49:11.224]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:51:53.238 --> 02:51:58.520]  Information exposing the global crime syndicate is coming out so fast we can't even cover it all.
[02:52:00.837 --> 02:52:08.042]  I'm just flabbergasted by the fact that it comes out that Bush ordered the leaks and then says, oh, but it was accidental that Libby burned a plane.
[02:52:08.062 --> 02:52:10.644]  If you believe that, I got a bridge on the moon I want to sell you.
[02:52:12.406 --> 02:52:13.787]  They're at Tranquility Base.
[02:52:15.108 --> 02:52:23.494]  And they're now saying the very same people that have manufactured intelligence over and over again have been caught red-handed and been caught wanting to stage shoot-downs of our planes.
[02:52:24.403 --> 02:52:25.143]  To claim their U.N.
[02:52:25.183 --> 02:52:31.745]  aircraft are now saying Iran's going to have an A-bomb or could have one in 16 days and we've got to attack them.
[02:52:31.825 --> 02:52:33.786]  It's just mind-blowing.
[02:52:34.226 --> 02:52:36.867]  And I cannot stress enough that I'm an idiot.
[02:52:38.267 --> 02:52:43.929]  But I guess I'm less of an idiot than everybody else because no one has put two and two together.
[02:52:43.989 --> 02:52:47.790]  I mean, everybody put two and two together saying it's staged, it's staged, it's staged.
[02:52:48.792 --> 02:52:52.576]  But with the demonstrations by the illegal aliens and their supporters.
[02:52:52.896 --> 02:52:55.679]  But I remember in December going, watch what happens.
[02:52:56.460 --> 02:53:02.266]  You're going to see riots, you're going to see demonstrations, you're going to see PR campaigns, because Fox said he was going to do it.
[02:53:02.306 --> 02:53:08.052]  A foreign leader destabilizing our country with his citizens, with their Mexican flags out marching.
[02:53:08.272 --> 02:53:10.795]  Now that blew up in their face, and now they're serving out American flags.
[02:53:11.255 --> 02:53:12.615]  We're going to get an article out on this.
[02:53:12.655 --> 02:53:14.076]  This is very, very important.
[02:53:14.096 --> 02:53:16.156]  And the Republicans brought the legislation up.
[02:53:16.176 --> 02:53:18.097]  They've been stalling for, what is it, four or five years?
[02:53:18.477 --> 02:53:26.799]  They brought it up right at this point to coincide with the PR campaign to make it look like the illegal aliens had a victory to embolden them in the future.
[02:53:26.839 --> 02:53:33.760]  They're starting a major movement in our country, but then our media is telling Americans to lay down and don't get involved and you can't fight City Hall.
[02:53:34.180 --> 02:53:37.681]  So the government and the media are mobilizing a foreign force in our country.
[02:53:39.851 --> 02:53:40.992]  And it's outrageous.
[02:53:42.113 --> 02:53:43.595]  And I'm extremely upset about it.
[02:53:43.615 --> 02:53:45.236]  I'm extremely angry about it.
[02:53:45.256 --> 02:53:49.200]  Meanwhile, they've got us ready to tromp off into a new war with Iran.
[02:53:50.882 --> 02:53:53.845]  Meanwhile, Chinese President Hu to face protest as he meets Bush.
[02:53:54.305 --> 02:53:55.806]  But of course, he'll be in a free speech zone.
[02:53:55.826 --> 02:53:59.210]  We're almost like China now when he comes to town on April 20th.
[02:53:59.310 --> 02:54:02.533]  I'm guessing that's in about six, seven days.
[02:54:03.266 --> 02:54:04.967]  And I could have spent all day on this, and I should.
[02:54:05.007 --> 02:54:07.988]  Drug companies inventing diseases to boost their profits.
[02:54:08.048 --> 02:54:09.368]  I ended with this yesterday, too.
[02:54:10.148 --> 02:54:13.129]  I'm going to get some guests on concerning this subject.
[02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:19.131]  The British Medical Society and others coming out and documenting what, again, we already knew organically, but now it's admitted.
[02:54:19.591 --> 02:54:22.492]  Big article by Paul Watson reinforcing the official lie.
[02:54:22.552 --> 02:54:31.415]  Government keen on playing a la Akbar tapes, but goes shy on shredding air traffic control conversations.
[02:54:32.432 --> 02:54:46.782]  Yeah, they shred all those, and they stage some new tapes of people yelling, Allah Akbar, but won't play them for us, and just put out the transcripts, and suddenly Michelle, he says he's a patching, and it's all staged, shows up and confesses to everything, and then the judge is saying the whole trial's staged, but so what?
[02:54:46.822 --> 02:55:00.912]  Let's just believe a government that produced the fat bin Laden tape, a fat guy in a room with a nose twice the size of bin Laden's, and they do a voice print test, it's not even anything near bin Laden, then linguists listen to it, and it's not even a Middle Eastern accent.
[02:55:02.524 --> 02:55:02.905]  I think?
[02:55:18.089 --> 02:55:19.449]  We're out of time here today.
[02:55:19.489 --> 02:55:23.971]  We'll be back again tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2 for the Big Friday edition.
[02:55:24.031 --> 02:55:26.852]  I do want to thank the great folks of the network running the show.
[02:55:26.872 --> 02:55:33.874]  I want to thank my folks, my employees down here in Austin, my staff, my comrades, my collaborators in the fight against the globalists.
[02:55:34.994 --> 02:55:40.076]  I want to thank all the sponsors, the affiliates, you the listeners, and of course God, number one.
[02:55:40.842 --> 02:55:42.763]  And we exposed the occult today.
[02:55:42.783 --> 02:55:45.764]  We spent about an hour and a half on it because that's what drives it.
[02:55:45.784 --> 02:55:47.765]  Every time you turn over a stone, that's what's there.
[02:55:48.325 --> 02:55:53.348]  That's the mindset of our enemies, the controllers, the slave masters.
[02:55:53.428 --> 02:55:54.608]  And you need to know your enemy.
[02:55:54.628 --> 02:55:56.049]  You need to know history.
[02:55:56.698 --> 02:56:00.859]  That's what we attempt to bring you at least once a week as a historical review of who we face.
[02:56:00.899 --> 02:56:04.120]  I intend to do some shows on the Federal Reserve System here in the near future.
[02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:05.140]  We haven't done that in about a year.
[02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:16.322]  It's important to bring that information back and add any new information because the new Fed chief says he's going to print money even faster than Greenspan did, devaluing the dollar already massively.
[02:56:16.782 --> 02:56:17.603]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:56:17.623 --> 02:56:18.443]  God bless you all.
[02:56:18.483 --> 02:56:19.903]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:20.103 --> 02:56:21.143]  Defeat these people.
[02:56:21.203 --> 02:56:21.904]  Take it to them.
[02:56:22.124 --> 02:56:23.324]  We can win with God's help.
[02:56:25.629 --> 02:56:25.829]  Hello.
