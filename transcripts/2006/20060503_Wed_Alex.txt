[00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.406]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.127]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:09.968]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:11.468]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:13.089]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.691]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:22.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:31.998]  Well, the mainstream media is starting to openly announce what we warned you of several years ago.
[00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:36.946]  They're going to shut down, piece by piece, the old internet.
[00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.927]  You know it as the current internet, the free internet.
[00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:49.731]  And force you on to the new internet where they restrict free speech and make you pay exorbitant prices to send email, to watch videos online, to stream any information.
[00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.125]  It is extremely serious what's happening.
[00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:54.826]  We'll get into those new developments.
[00:00:55.266 --> 00:01:01.648]  Of course, legislation has also passed the House that goes a long way towards doing this.
[00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:06.490]  There's also new thought crime, speech crime legislation very close to passing.
[00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.513]  Yet again, we've defeated this the last seven years in a row, but they're back at it double-headed.
[00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:17.194]  They've already tried once this year, tried last year, and they're trying it again.
[00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:18.475]  We'll cover that.
[00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:23.877]  Oil prices are getting very close to $75 a barrel.
[00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:28.900]  But don't worry, the House is to take up anti-price gouging bill.
[00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:32.403]  That's like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
[00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:36.425]  And the Exxon chief says she understands gas woes.
[00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:43.149]  Meanwhile, we found a video yesterday and posted it on JonesReport.com.
[00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.131]  An old drudgily-wudgily picked it up.
[00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:51.158]  And has it up on his main page, George Bush waving Mexican flags.
[00:01:51.898 --> 00:01:59.563]  George Bush in the 2004 presidential campaign singing the Star Spangled Banner in Spanish.
[00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:05.706]  Of course, a week ago, with a big controversy over the new Star Spangled Banner, they've changed the words and sing it in Spanish.
[00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.407]  Bush says that's not proper.
[00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:11.370]  Well, then why don't we have video of him doing just that?
[00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.352]  And that's up at jonesreport.com right now.
[00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:20.853]  Also, 113 killed in Russian plane crash.
[00:02:20.893 --> 00:02:21.973]  We'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:25.174]  Wisconsin bill to ban coerced chip implants.
[00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.515]  This out of RFID Journal.
[00:02:28.136 --> 00:02:32.337]  And the day without gringos was a big flop, the Associated Press was reporting.
[00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:39.240]  Yes, we could see that that had happened by yesterday, but now they're getting on the bandwagon and reporting the truth for once, I guess.
[00:02:40.678 --> 00:02:43.683]  But coming up, we've got three guests today.
[00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:55.801]  We're going to have Terry Anderson on, who's going to be here in Texas this weekend for a reckoning, a demonstration of protest they've been planning for months to be held out at Crawford.
[00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:57.217]  We're good to go.
[00:03:12.957 --> 00:03:32.457]  Sheriff Arpaio, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, announced that approximately 100 volunteer posse and sheriff's deputies will soon be randomly patrolling the desert areas and main roadways in southwest Maricopa County as a part of an operation to curb the flow of illegal immigrants entering the country.
[00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:54.467]  Of course, last week we had Al Garza, National Coordinator of the Minutemen, on, and I came up with the idea, I don't think I originated this, but I forwarded it, hadn't seen it in the media, to have sheriffs deputize citizens to defend the border so they can at least shoot back when the Mexican troops are firing on them, which happens on a weekly basis on average.
[00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:57.859]  And boom, we put a report out on this.
[00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.901]  It got a lot of circulation on the immigration sites.
[00:04:00.322 --> 00:04:03.245]  I wonder if that's where Arpaio got the idea.
[00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:07.851]  I don't agree with a lot of the things that Arpaio does do, but I agree with this.
[00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.810]  This is exactly what the sheriff's supposed to be doing.
[00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.613]  CBS News 5 headline, Sheriff to start posse patrols to curb illegal immigration flow.
[00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:21.535]  And he is scheduled with us coming up in the next segment.
[00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:26.537]  Now, usually when we try to get the sheriff on, he says he's coming on at one time and he comes on at another time.
[00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:28.318]  But he always shows up.
[00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:33.680]  He knows that he takes a licking and keeps on a ticking.
[00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.862]  And so at least we can say that he's not afraid to
[00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:41.606]  Coming to an interview that's confrontational.
[00:04:41.646 --> 00:04:46.849]  But how do I become confrontational with Arpaio, the sheriff, over this?
[00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:47.610]  I agree with him.
[00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.515]  So we'll be praising Sheriff Joe Arpaio after this quick break on the other side.
[00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:59.038]  Websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.476]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.737 --> 00:05:07.318]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:12.302]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:19.408]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:21.709]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.750]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.512]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:34.115]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:41.598]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:44.259]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:03.314 --> 00:06:04.354]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:07.456]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:11.877]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.318 --> 00:06:13.158]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:18.020]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:20.654]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:21.134 --> 00:06:35.818]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:42.920]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.745]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.105 --> 00:07:20.654]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:27.877]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:29.498]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:33.459]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[00:07:51.006 --> 00:07:51.847]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:06.443]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:08.143]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.004]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.644 --> 00:08:11.445]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:13.045]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:17.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:22.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:40.360]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, blasting out nationwide on the AM and FM dial, simulcasting on Global Shortwave and on the Internet at InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, and many other sites.
[00:08:40.861 --> 00:08:46.084]  We're really pleased to be joined by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Maricopa County, Phoenix.
[00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:48.266]  Arizona, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:52.111]  Sheriff to start posse patrols to curb illegal immigration flow.
[00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:57.459]  We've been calling for this for quite a while, and I really asked listeners to push for this last week.
[00:08:58.172 --> 00:09:03.738]  And we talked to the head of the Minutemen Project, the National Coordinator, Al Garza, about it.
[00:09:03.758 --> 00:09:06.781]  And he said he was going to contact sheriffs and try to get this done.
[00:09:07.122 --> 00:09:08.003]  They've killed police.
[00:09:08.023 --> 00:09:08.944]  They've killed FBI.
[00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:10.085]  They've killed Forest Service.
[00:09:10.105 --> 00:09:11.747]  They've killed DEA.
[00:09:12.167 --> 00:09:14.630]  We had a Texas sheriff on a few months ago.
[00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:19.455]  They came right up to him, aimed machine guns at him, and took drugs back that they had seized.
[00:09:20.255 --> 00:09:32.080]  We need the military on the border, but if the military won't do it because our president won't, we need the sheriffs to deputize, we need the sheriffs to move armored vehicles in there, and when the Mexican troops open fire, we need to open fire on them.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.542]  Sheriff Arpaio, I agree with you on your stance on this, sir.
[00:09:36.582 --> 00:09:37.582]  Why did you decide to do this?
[00:09:37.802 --> 00:09:40.563]  Well, first of all, the Minutemen never contacted me.
[00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:42.383]  Well, I wasn't saying that this came from the Minutemen.
[00:09:42.423 --> 00:09:44.244]  I'm saying that we've been calling for this.
[00:09:44.524 --> 00:09:45.144]  Well, okay.
[00:09:45.164 --> 00:09:46.104]  You're very astute.
[00:09:46.124 --> 00:09:46.985]  I have a posse.
[00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.585]  I've had it 13 years.
[00:09:48.645 --> 00:09:49.485]  I've been the sheriff.
[00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:53.607]  I go after hookers, deadbeats, patrol, and everything else.
[00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:55.347]  This is just another operation.
[00:09:55.827 --> 00:10:01.649]  There's a new state law here in Arizona where you can, according to the legal opinion...
[00:10:02.513 --> 00:10:09.318]  From our attorneys, you can arrest the coyote, the smuggler, plus those that are conspiring.
[00:10:09.398 --> 00:10:10.599]  Those are the illegals.
[00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:14.701]  We've arrested 120 so far in two months.
[00:10:15.142 --> 00:10:19.925]  They're charged with felonies, one and a half years to three years in jail they can get.
[00:10:20.425 --> 00:10:27.648]  Under this new law, it's a little controversial, but now I'm calling out my posse because we just can't handle this.
[00:10:27.728 --> 00:10:35.291]  I'm the only law enforcement agency in the state of Arizona and across the nation locking up the illegals.
[00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:41.733]  If there are Minutemen that live in your county, can they come join the posse if you vet them?
[00:10:42.533 --> 00:10:46.195]  Well, if I want to swear them in, the posse is not vigilantes.
[00:10:46.215 --> 00:10:47.215]  They're not Minutemen.
[00:10:48.030 --> 00:11:01.404]  Only the sheriff under the Constitution can swear in private citizens and make them posse men, and they have the same authority as my deputy sheriffs when they're working under my supervision and are close by to deputies.
[00:11:02.074 --> 00:11:05.738]  And we've been doing so many programs with the volunteer posse.
[00:11:05.758 --> 00:11:17.451]  We have airplanes, helicopters, jeeps, horses, and I've built this posse up to 3,000 since I've been the sheriff, and now I'm going to utilize them on this other program.
[00:11:17.471 --> 00:11:19.153]  It's just another little program.
[00:11:19.253 --> 00:11:20.915]  The sheriff's got a posse.
[00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:26.479]  Now, at the same time, I just want to get your view on the minute, man.
[00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:33.223]  All they do, and they've had no incidents, all they do is go with binoculars and radios and call the Border Patrol when they see lawbreakers.
[00:11:33.243 --> 00:11:34.324]  You don't have a problem with that, do you?
[00:11:35.044 --> 00:11:37.846]  No, it's just like citizens on patrol.
[00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.027]  It's like block watch.
[00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:40.708]  There's no difference.
[00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:47.292]  Why do you think some of the liberals and people have been so upset about citizens simply looking for crime?
[00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.491]  Well, I can understand that.
[00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:52.473]  They're making a big national statement on this.
[00:11:52.513 --> 00:11:54.294]  I'm not saying I'm for the minute, man.
[00:11:54.354 --> 00:12:00.237]  I believe legitimate law enforcement should handle this problem.
[00:12:00.337 --> 00:12:02.138]  I'll just put more Border Patrol there.
[00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:03.239]  But it's not been handled.
[00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:04.259]  That's why they're having to do it.
[00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:05.300]  Well, I don't know.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.844]  They're not going to clean up the illegal immigrant problem, aliens, and I'm not going to do it either with what I'm doing.
[00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:16.026]  I'm trying to send a message, stay out of this county, go to another county,
[00:12:16.696 --> 00:12:19.177]  I'm the sheriff here in this county.
[00:12:19.457 --> 00:12:21.217]  3.8 million people I represent.
[00:12:21.257 --> 00:12:23.478]  Well, sir, I've been to Phoenix.
[00:12:23.518 --> 00:12:26.078]  There are obviously illegal aliens walking around all over.
[00:12:26.098 --> 00:12:27.599]  It's been a few years since I was there.
[00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:32.280]  I mean, are you going to have your posse out asking for people that fit the M.O.?
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.081]  No.
[00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:35.301]  No, I am not.
[00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:39.722]  I was the director in Mexico City of the Federal Drug Enforcement.
[00:12:39.762 --> 00:12:41.442]  I know Mexico.
[00:12:41.502 --> 00:12:43.443]  I work with the Attorney General, the President.
[00:12:43.843 --> 00:12:49.364]  I am not going on a street corner, just like I don't go on a street corner to bust a guy using marijuana.
[00:12:49.805 --> 00:12:54.586]  I am going after the smuggler, and this new law says I can lock up the people that they're smuggling.
[00:12:54.606 --> 00:12:56.626]  Ian, I'm locking them all up.
[00:12:56.786 --> 00:13:01.027]  Well, that's a good point, because it's the smugglers are the folks that are shooting at police.
[00:13:01.988 --> 00:13:03.188]  Well, I'm going after them.
[00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:04.388]  I'm going after the illegals.
[00:13:04.428 --> 00:13:11.470]  We just busted 100 pounds of methamphetamine, a record case here, last week, and they were all illegals.
[00:13:12.113 --> 00:13:16.296]  They're smuggling drugs into this country and selling it to our kids.
[00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:20.358]  So it's not just being illegal, it's also committing crimes.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.083]  What do you think the national media is going to do with you in making this announcement?
[00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:27.903]  Oh, I don't know.
[00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:29.684]  They call me when I go to the toilets.
[00:13:29.764 --> 00:13:31.045]  They're already calling me.
[00:13:31.265 --> 00:13:34.287]  This isn't the only controversial thing I've done.
[00:13:34.307 --> 00:13:37.829]  And I've got a tent city with 2,000 people in it.
[00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.552]  So nobody better ever say that I don't have room...
[00:13:42.256 --> 00:13:46.480]  That police and jurists don't have room in their jails.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.084]  I have 10,000 in jail, and I'll put 50,000 in there if I have to.
[00:13:51.104 --> 00:13:53.946]  So nobody ever used that as an excuse.
[00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:55.187]  There's no place to put them.
[00:13:55.548 --> 00:13:58.130]  So you have 10,000 people in jail?
[00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.951]  Yeah, and I want 20,000.
[00:14:00.352 --> 00:14:04.415]  So nobody's going to tell me that I have no room.
[00:14:04.455 --> 00:14:05.276]  I don't have room.
[00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:05.856]  But you know what?
[00:14:05.896 --> 00:14:06.897]  I put tents up.
[00:14:07.818 --> 00:14:09.920]  Thirteen years ago, I put tents up.
[00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:12.992]  And I'm going to put more tents up if I have to.
[00:14:13.032 --> 00:14:15.214]  So I don't want anybody to say there's no room.
[00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:16.434]  And it's expensive.
[00:14:16.495 --> 00:14:18.416]  My meals are 30 cents a day.
[00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:20.777]  A day, not a meal.
[00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:23.639]  So what does it cost to feed these guys?
[00:14:25.004 --> 00:14:25.945]  No, I understand.
[00:14:25.985 --> 00:14:36.350]  You know, I've had you on a few times in the past, and I disagree with some of the things you do, because I believe some of it doesn't look very constitutional from my point of view.
[00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.132]  And I am concerned by the fact that America has more people in prison than any other country in the world.
[00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:44.974]  The more people we put in prison, the more drugs we have on our streets.
[00:14:45.194 --> 00:14:48.576]  I mean, Sheriff Arpaio, would you say the drug war is working?
[00:14:49.276 --> 00:14:50.997]  No, but I'm doing my part.
[00:14:51.037 --> 00:14:51.677]  I spent 45 years...
[00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:55.670]  In the drug fight.
[00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.652]  In Turkey, I was the only federal agent in Turkey.
[00:14:59.512 --> 00:15:03.315]  In Mexico, South America, I fought this battle for 45 years.
[00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:05.476]  Now I'm fighting it as the sheriff.
[00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:10.259]  But national statistics show we have triple the heroin, double the cocaine on our streets than we had 12 years ago.
[00:15:10.499 --> 00:15:11.600]  Well, I don't know about that.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.601]  You're right.
[00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:14.682]  Everybody's talking about methamphetamine.
[00:15:14.702 --> 00:15:15.803]  They're forgetting heroin.
[00:15:16.303 --> 00:15:18.405]  We're cracking down on heroin, too.
[00:15:18.465 --> 00:15:19.385]  It's back again.
[00:15:19.405 --> 00:15:20.466]  Full time.
[00:15:21.238 --> 00:15:22.078]  So, I don't know.
[00:15:22.318 --> 00:15:24.159]  I'm not for legalizing drugs.
[00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:26.499]  Let me ask you a question, sir.
[00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:31.560]  What are you going to do if your deputies are near the border and Mexican troops open fire on you?
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.981]  I mean, federal agencies and others just lay down and flop around begging them and don't even shoot back.
[00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:38.321]  Well, I'm not at the border.
[00:15:38.381 --> 00:15:39.841]  I'm 150 miles from the border.
[00:15:39.881 --> 00:15:48.503]  Well, I understand, but what would you do if your county was on the border, like a lot of sheriffs are, and troops open fire on you from a...
[00:15:48.983 --> 00:15:50.104]  Well, you fire back.
[00:15:50.164 --> 00:15:51.384]  What do you mean what you would do?
[00:15:52.725 --> 00:15:53.926]  I don't understand the question.
[00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:55.506]  Well, the Border Patrol and others don't.
[00:15:55.526 --> 00:15:58.028]  They've been told that they'll be fired if they do.
[00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:00.349]  They just literally lay on their bellies and beg.
[00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:01.790]  You've got to protect yourself.
[00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.411]  How can you be shot at and not retaliate?
[00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:05.291]  I don't understand that.
[00:16:05.311 --> 00:16:07.372]  My deputies, we give them AR-16s.
[00:16:09.053 --> 00:16:12.195]  I give them, and I got a machine gun, .50 caliber.
[00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:17.598]  You think if they fire on my deputies, we're just going to hide in the bushes?
[00:16:18.038 --> 00:16:24.142]  In fact, Los Zetas, their special forces folks have been running around in Texas killing a lot of people.
[00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:27.324]  What are you going to do if Los Zetas starts operating in Phoenix?
[00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:28.824]  If what operates here?
[00:16:29.325 --> 00:16:34.087]  Los Zetas, the paramilitary drug dealing gangs.
[00:16:34.107 --> 00:16:34.988]  They're real big in Texas.
[00:16:35.008 --> 00:16:36.589]  Well, we're going to protect ourselves.
[00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:39.971]  Just like we do on anybody that shoots at my deputies.
[00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:41.632]  I don't care who they are.
[00:16:42.212 --> 00:16:45.214]  What difference does it make who they are when they're firing on my deputies?
[00:16:45.274 --> 00:16:49.097]  How has organized crime behaved since you've really gotten tough in your county?
[00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:50.638]  Have they moved out of Phoenix?
[00:16:50.898 --> 00:16:51.939]  What organized crime?
[00:16:51.979 --> 00:16:54.661]  Mafia or the others that are copying the Mafia?
[00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.442]  You mean the Mexicans and all that?
[00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:57.983]  Yeah, the Mexican Mafia, all of it.
[00:16:58.063 --> 00:16:59.003]  Well, they're still around.
[00:16:59.043 --> 00:17:04.507]  I have quite a few in jail in the maximum security waiting to go to trial.
[00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:08.304]  I mean, you got the gangs around this area.
[00:17:08.324 --> 00:17:09.486]  You got them in California.
[00:17:09.506 --> 00:17:10.386]  You got them everywhere.
[00:17:11.808 --> 00:17:13.249]  We got to take care of those gangs.
[00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:14.470]  It used to be the mafia.
[00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.312]  Are you worried about assassination?
[00:17:16.332 --> 00:17:21.917]  I saw an article here out of the news where it says the plot to assassinate Arpaio.
[00:17:21.937 --> 00:17:23.499]  Can you briefly tell us about that?
[00:17:23.519 --> 00:17:24.359]  Well, I don't know.
[00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:28.103]  I had about 12 convictions that killed me in the last two, three years.
[00:17:28.123 --> 00:17:28.984]  It doesn't bother me.
[00:17:29.904 --> 00:17:30.747]  I've been around 45 years.
[00:17:30.807 --> 00:17:34.559]  Did you say you've had 12 convictions of people that were attempting to murder you?
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.204]  Well, murder or threats.
[00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:43.975]  Who was this particular guy that was in your jail and then it came out that he was supposedly planning to bomb you or something?
[00:17:43.995 --> 00:17:46.617]  Yeah, that guy was found not guilty.
[00:17:46.677 --> 00:17:47.698]  He built a bomb.
[00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:53.983]  He's suing me for millions and millions for false arrest when he built a bomb to put in my car.
[00:17:54.623 --> 00:17:58.226]  He spent four years in jail and the jury found him not guilty.
[00:17:58.806 --> 00:18:00.207]  Was that a sting, though?
[00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:01.649]  I mean, was that entrapment?
[00:18:02.009 --> 00:18:03.250]  No, it wasn't entrapment.
[00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.911]  You don't entrap.
[00:18:05.291 --> 00:18:05.932]  The guy is...
[00:18:06.828 --> 00:18:07.909]  Help build the bomb.
[00:18:07.929 --> 00:18:09.990]  We had the conversation.
[00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:11.271]  We had the case.
[00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:14.693]  We had stings all the time on drugs and every other crime.
[00:18:15.313 --> 00:18:18.775]  But wasn't it officers or sheriff's deputies that tried to get him to do that?
[00:18:18.976 --> 00:18:19.976]  No, no, no.
[00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:20.937]  We don't try.
[00:18:20.977 --> 00:18:23.538]  The guy tried to blow up a high school before that.
[00:18:23.558 --> 00:18:23.879]  Really?
[00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:26.960]  I can't trap a guy that already knows about the bomb.
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.341]  Why did the jury find him non-guilty?
[00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:31.143]  Well, he was in jail for four years before he got to trial.
[00:18:31.223 --> 00:18:32.284]  One of our detectives...
[00:18:33.297 --> 00:18:37.736]  Who is facing other problems with this office, backtracked.
[00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.049]  I'm not going to get into it that much.
[00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:44.611]  I don't know if you play in Phoenix, but there's a lawsuit pending on me on that.
[00:18:44.652 --> 00:18:44.812]  Okay.
[00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:49.254]  Well, listen, Sheriff Arpaio, I agree with you about having a posse.
[00:18:49.974 --> 00:18:52.276]  I don't want the feds running around deputizing people.
[00:18:52.316 --> 00:18:53.476]  That's unconstitutional.
[00:18:54.117 --> 00:18:57.098]  But I'm glad that you're actually deputizing people to deal with real crises.
[00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:01.201]  Remember the FBI flyer saying those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.362]  Constitution could be terrorists?
[00:19:03.382 --> 00:19:04.362]  Remember that flyer back in 1999?
[00:19:04.402 --> 00:19:04.562]  Mm-hmm.
[00:19:06.255 --> 00:19:06.815]  Vaguely.
[00:19:07.036 --> 00:19:08.737]  I used to be a Fed for 30 years.
[00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.779]  I know, but you didn't agree with that, saying those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.020]  Constitution might be terrorists.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.821]  No, we've got to protect our Constitution.
[00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:18.083]  We've got to protect the people of this country.
[00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:22.005]  Isn't that the first mission of government, to protect our people?
[00:19:22.085 --> 00:19:23.686]  I thought that's what it was.
[00:19:23.706 --> 00:19:25.067]  Well, I mean, that's the point I'm making.
[00:19:25.087 --> 00:19:27.428]  You're actually deputizing people for real issues.
[00:19:27.488 --> 00:19:32.392]  I mean, of illegal alien invaders saying this is Mexico isn't a crisis, I don't know what is.
[00:19:32.792 --> 00:19:33.692]  Well, you're right.
[00:19:34.093 --> 00:19:34.393]  Listen...
[00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:35.673]  Thank you, sir.
[00:19:35.993 --> 00:19:38.914]  All right, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, we agree on this one.
[00:19:39.134 --> 00:19:40.315]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[00:19:40.395 --> 00:19:40.795]  Thank you.
[00:19:41.035 --> 00:19:41.475]  Take care.
[00:19:42.775 --> 00:19:46.096]  Folks, that guy is the real character.
[00:19:46.176 --> 00:19:50.638]  I mean, you ought to see the outtake video I've got from a drug war film I've been working on.
[00:19:51.138 --> 00:19:53.579]  You ought to spend a few days inside his camp.
[00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:56.880]  Just a complete and total maniac.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.060]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.816 --> 00:20:07.319]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.743]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.043 --> 00:20:12.583]  We listened.
[00:20:12.903 --> 00:20:17.887]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.147 --> 00:20:18.648]  We listened.
[00:20:19.028 --> 00:20:22.070]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.011]  We listened.
[00:20:23.471 --> 00:20:26.633]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259 by calling
[00:20:52.757 --> 00:20:53.938]  We're good to go.
[00:21:21.835 --> 00:21:29.543]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.963 --> 00:21:34.768]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.445 --> 00:21:40.467]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.248 --> 00:21:45.389]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:46.030]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.970]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:48.331]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.631 --> 00:21:48.911]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:03.531]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.072 --> 00:22:13.481]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[00:22:13.702 --> 00:22:18.466]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[00:22:18.486 --> 00:22:23.832]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[00:22:24.632 --> 00:22:34.879]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War, 1990-1991.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:43.565]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:46.286]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:46.346 --> 00:22:46.827]  Call now.
[00:22:46.847 --> 00:22:49.208]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:01.194 --> 00:23:01.995]  We're good to go.
[00:23:02.015 --> 00:23:02.496]  We're good to go.
[00:23:18.254 --> 00:23:23.297]  The MPG cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[00:23:23.457 --> 00:23:28.160]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved, and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.

[00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:11.156]  I'll be honest with you, I don't like Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[00:24:11.196 --> 00:24:16.078]  I mean, if I try to list all the horrible things he's up to, the police state he has set up.
[00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:24.362]  Last thing I heard is he's going to put thumb scanners in all the police cars, all the sheriff's cars, and make you thumb scan when he pulls you over.
[00:24:24.382 --> 00:24:31.145]  He's got helicopters flying around looking for pools that don't look clean, and he comes and arrests you if you don't.
[00:24:31.977 --> 00:24:43.723]  Of course, when he ran over a sidewalk and jumped a large boulder and was stumbling around, no one got in trouble.
[00:24:44.363 --> 00:24:46.544]  And he's been involved in a bunch of other craziness.
[00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:49.265]  And he's a total maniac.
[00:24:49.285 --> 00:24:55.228]  Whenever you talk to him during the breaks, it's like he's not there.
[00:24:55.849 --> 00:25:00.731]  In fact, when Scott got him on the line, he said, this guy seems totally out of it.
[00:25:01.403 --> 00:25:02.744]  And then I went and talked to him during the break.
[00:25:02.764 --> 00:25:03.465]  Hello, Sheriff.
[00:25:03.485 --> 00:25:04.386]  Thank you for coming on.
[00:25:04.746 --> 00:25:12.352]  He's like... And then as soon as he gets on air, it's like he comes alive and... I've got 30 cent a day meals.
[00:25:12.473 --> 00:25:13.433]  I've got camps.
[00:25:13.613 --> 00:25:15.635]  I've got tents out there.
[00:25:15.955 --> 00:25:16.276]  I want 50,000, 20,000.
[00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:25.744]  I want... But side issue, I shouldn't be getting off into Arpaio.
[00:25:27.987 --> 00:25:36.429]  But let's just say he was giving us the old spin job with what he was telling us about that pipe bomb case.
[00:25:36.849 --> 00:25:40.369]  There's a reason the jury went against him.
[00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:46.971]  There's a reason there's a sheriff's deputy who's siding with those that are suing him.
[00:25:47.491 --> 00:25:50.311]  There's a reason Arpaio is in trouble.
[00:25:51.272 --> 00:25:53.192]  And you watch down the road...
[00:25:54.454 --> 00:25:56.815]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:25:56.876 --> 00:26:03.159]  But I have to agree with Arpaio with having the posse go out and go after these illegal aliens.
[00:26:03.219 --> 00:26:10.504]  But you notice he backed off a little on when someone's obviously an illegal alien and they pull them over and they don't have any of their driver's license, nothing.
[00:26:10.844 --> 00:26:13.206]  They just let them go, and that's happening all over the country.
[00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:18.749]  I personally get sick of talking about the open borders.
[00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:21.811]  I personally get sick of having to discuss it, but we have to.
[00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:24.031]  Our country is being invaded.
[00:26:24.131 --> 00:26:27.314]  Our country's borders are predominantly wide open.
[00:26:28.476 --> 00:26:43.813]  A large portion of the 25 million illegal aliens that are here hate America openly and say that they, quote, hate the gringos and a day without gringos and that this is going to be Aslan, a mythical Aztec kingdom.
[00:26:45.638 --> 00:26:47.398]  And it's being taught in the public schools.
[00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:48.739]  It's being taught in the colleges.
[00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:55.800]  Again, there's the UT professor, Chicano Studies head up in UT Arlington who openly says kill all the whites now.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:03.202]  Can you imagine if a white professor was getting up saying kill all the Mexicans, kill all the Latin Americans?
[00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:06.462]  Again, I have nothing against Mexicans.
[00:27:06.622 --> 00:27:08.643]  I have nothing against any of these groups.
[00:27:09.143 --> 00:27:12.184]  We're not the ones saying kill all the Mexicans.
[00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:13.964]  Do you understand that
[00:27:14.873 --> 00:27:21.058]  The prominent leaders of these movements are rabid, anti-American hate mongers.
[00:27:22.099 --> 00:27:28.424]  And they have the right to say whatever they want, but I have the right to say that I disagree with them and I'm against what they're doing.
[00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:33.691]  And I don't like them burning American flags, and we've got photos of that in the last four weeks of demonstrations.
[00:27:34.232 --> 00:27:40.075]  I don't like the 4-1, 5-1, 6-1, 7-1, 8-1, 9-1 in some cases.
[00:27:41.016 --> 00:27:42.757]  In the first few weeks it was like 9-1.
[00:27:42.797 --> 00:27:44.318]  Now it's about half and half.
[00:27:44.839 --> 00:27:46.860]  Mexican flags against American flags.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.342]  Flying American flags upside down.
[00:27:49.442 --> 00:27:51.623]  Flying Mexican flags over American flags.
[00:27:52.344 --> 00:27:53.044]  Come on!
[00:27:54.485 --> 00:27:55.125]  Come on!
[00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:58.868]  And even liberal websites are now saying they've had enough.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.684]  Even mainstream news is starting to say this is ridiculous.
[00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:06.188]  Even the Associated Press is reporting headline, A Day Without Gringos.
[00:28:06.208 --> 00:28:08.430]  In fact, where's that article?
[00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.954]  I just had it here in front of me.
[00:28:13.696 --> 00:28:14.157]  Oh, here it is.
[00:28:14.177 --> 00:28:16.780]  A Day Without Gringos is a flop.
[00:28:18.436 --> 00:28:19.676]  The boycott of U.S.
[00:28:19.716 --> 00:28:26.519]  businesses dubbed a day without gringos, this is AP, and aimed at supporting migrants, they're not illegal aliens, they're migrants, in the U.S.
[00:28:26.559 --> 00:28:31.561]  appears to have had little impact, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico said Tuesday.
[00:28:32.081 --> 00:28:41.424]  Monday's protests were timed to coincide with the great American boycott in the United States, where hundreds of thousands of immigrants stayed away from jobs and schools across the country.
[00:28:42.242 --> 00:28:44.965]  Again, it was officially in Mexico called A Day Without Gringos.
[00:28:44.985 --> 00:28:46.746]  That was on their national television.
[00:28:46.786 --> 00:28:47.427]  Imagine that.
[00:28:48.128 --> 00:28:51.751]  Even though we don't have the conclusive numbers, I think there wasn't a lot of negative effect.
[00:28:52.151 --> 00:28:58.757]  Chamber President Larry Rubin said by telephone from Washington where he and other business leaders are lobbying for comprehensive immigration reform.
[00:28:59.678 --> 00:29:03.321]  Now, again, they're the ones calling for open borders, but even they admit it didn't have a big effect.
[00:29:03.662 --> 00:29:05.984]  We basically think it was more symbolic.
[00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:10.994]  Rubin said the boycott unwisely targeted some of the immigrants' best allies, U.S.
[00:29:11.014 --> 00:29:20.622]  corporations that have actively lobbied Congress for immigration reform, including legalization for many of the estimated 11 million, it's 25 million folks, undocumented migrants in the United States.
[00:29:21.283 --> 00:29:22.964]  By the way, 25 million is conservative.
[00:29:24.185 --> 00:29:28.929]  Yeah, Cargill and most of the other big meatpackers told him, take Monday off, yes.
[00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:32.212]  Some cases we're going to pay your salary, we're going to pay your wages.
[00:29:32.862 --> 00:29:34.303]  You just go protest, okay?
[00:29:34.323 --> 00:29:38.407]  You're a foreign group and big bankers control you and you go do a good job.
[00:29:38.667 --> 00:29:43.230]  We support George Bush's PR firm that hired you with Vicente Fox to stage this.
[00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.773]  So you go out there and you bully those Americans back into submission.
[00:29:47.034 --> 00:29:48.575]  You go ahead and you do a good job.
[00:29:48.855 --> 00:29:49.516]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:52.758]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.239 --> 00:29:54.840]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.443]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.092 --> 00:30:05.673]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[00:32:02.236 --> 00:32:09.119]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:22.185]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:32:22.365 --> 00:32:24.146]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:27.807]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:32:28.067 --> 00:32:31.849]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:32:32.109 --> 00:32:37.071]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[00:32:39.312 --> 00:32:43.293]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[00:32:51.616 --> 00:32:55.097]  I want to get into the scam concerning energy.
[00:32:55.117 --> 00:32:56.998]  Oil prices right up at $75 a barrel.
[00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:57.638]  Talk of it hitting $100.
[00:33:22.176 --> 00:33:24.498]  Congress is going to investigate, so don't worry.
[00:33:24.518 --> 00:33:26.320]  They'll fix it.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:29.182]  Most of them are just on the oil company payroll.
[00:33:30.123 --> 00:33:34.306]  Squadrons of neocons on talk radio lying about what's really going on.
[00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:35.427]  We'll discuss it all.
[00:33:35.827 --> 00:33:37.849]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:42.933]  And again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:43.294 --> 00:33:45.095]  Let's go ahead and talk to BL in Texas.
[00:33:45.155 --> 00:33:45.996]  BL, go ahead.
[00:33:46.576 --> 00:33:47.137]  Hi, Alex.
[00:33:47.417 --> 00:33:48.378]  Two Scots well met.
[00:33:49.352 --> 00:33:54.914]  I got a couple of quick things about gas, but I just wanted to say it's unusual.
[00:33:54.934 --> 00:34:06.939]  It seems odd to me that the Sturm Group and Fuhrer of Maricopa County has only captured 120 illegals in two months when Gwen Spencer can find more than that in two hours.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.602]  In fact, I meant to get to that with Arpaio, the sheriff.
[00:34:12.982 --> 00:34:16.583]  This is obviously, at least on the surface, looks like a publicity stunt.
[00:34:17.644 --> 00:34:18.264]  Guaranteed.
[00:34:19.062 --> 00:34:26.907]  If I had, say, 50 Austin police, I could go out and in a day probably arrest 200 people.
[00:34:27.027 --> 00:34:30.349]  I could have paddy wagons, throw them in the back, drive them in.
[00:34:30.809 --> 00:34:40.195]  Guaranteed, you go to the day labor sites, you go into East Austin, you go into these areas, and you can spot these people from a mile away.
[00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:41.459]  Absolutely.
[00:34:42.439 --> 00:34:47.501]  On the gas thing, everybody's upset about $75 a barrel, $100 a barrel.
[00:34:47.541 --> 00:35:02.906]  It's surprising how insignificant the cost of a barrel of oil is compared to the fact that when Bush came into office, when the Reichsfuhrer took power, they removed the $2 profit cap per barrel, and now it's up over 1,100%.
[00:35:02.946 --> 00:35:04.986]  They're reporting profits over $22 per barrel.
[00:35:10.102 --> 00:35:14.210]  I know, and they've got this fraudulent number that the oil companies are only making 8.6%.
[00:35:15.092 --> 00:35:17.016]  Number one, that's not true.
[00:35:17.036 --> 00:35:18.018]  We've got their numbers.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.823]  But, I mean, there's so many facets to this.
[00:35:21.437 --> 00:35:27.843]  Well, the other thing is, after Katrina, Bush deregulated the formulation of gasoline.
[00:35:27.983 --> 00:35:30.245]  So that should have driven it down even more.
[00:35:30.285 --> 00:35:34.268]  Yeah, we hear that it's the boutique oils, and they won't let us build more refineries.
[00:35:34.648 --> 00:35:35.969]  It's all lies.
[00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:41.294]  Well, I'm getting much less fuel mileage than I was before Katrina happened.
[00:35:41.554 --> 00:35:51.416]  And I think when people start seeing their fuel injection components failing and they're wondering why, it's because whatever you're buying a gallon of, it's not necessarily a gallon of gasoline.
[00:35:52.136 --> 00:35:52.836]  I agree with you.
[00:35:52.876 --> 00:35:54.997]  There's all sorts of scamming going on.
[00:35:55.057 --> 00:35:56.257]  BL, thanks for the call.
[00:35:57.517 --> 00:36:02.678]  We're going to go to Dave and Richard and others here in just a moment, but since he brings it up now, let me just comment on energy.
[00:36:04.459 --> 00:36:05.739]  It is not my opinion...
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:33.449]  Okay, this weekend I was listening to several different neocon talk shows driving around doing errands, and it's like they have a script or talking points, and they were saying that, well, the oil companies are only making 8.6%, and it's the liberals, they won't let us build more refineries, and it's the boutique oils or fuels, and it's caused by all of this, and it's the Arabs, it's not the oil companies, it's the oil companies, it's not their fault.
[00:36:35.287 --> 00:36:36.428]  Let's just stop right there.
[00:36:38.929 --> 00:36:43.212]  It came out last year in the LA Times, the Washington Post.
[00:36:43.352 --> 00:36:51.117]  It is totally confirmed, and it of course first broke in the alternative media via lawsuits and leaks.
[00:36:51.397 --> 00:36:57.620]  And ExxonMobil and Chevron and Dutch Royal Shell and Texaco do not deny it.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.401]  These are authentic.
[00:36:59.989 --> 00:37:13.033]  In fact, you can just type in, Peak Oil is a Fraud, Peak Oil Scam Alex Jones, or Peak Oil Scam Prison Planet, into Google, and you'll find several big articles we wrote late last year on this subject.
[00:37:13.093 --> 00:37:16.533]  I even did a three-hour coast-to-coast AM appearance on the subject.
[00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:25.716]  And within that article, we have links to the other articles we wrote, with links to all the mainstream news articles, when the documents got released.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:36.009]  And in the documents, ExxonMobil, Texaco, Chevron, a bunch of others, openly are conspiring with each other.
[00:37:36.189 --> 00:37:45.318]  In 1995 and 1996, the documents are from those two years, and they say there's too much oil, too many new fields being found, too much oil coming online.
[00:37:46.515 --> 00:38:04.323]  We need to go and buy up the rest of the private refineries, and we need to shut them down and close them, and then we can create an artificial bottleneck and not allow too much fuel on the market and guarantee large profits.
[00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:06.644]  Now, that's not free market.
[00:38:06.704 --> 00:38:07.905]  That is an oligopoly.
[00:38:08.265 --> 00:38:13.287]  An oligopoly is a consortium or a cartel getting together to create a monopoly.
[00:38:13.903 --> 00:38:17.708]  Monopoly is just when one company owns it all and controls the entire system.
[00:38:18.168 --> 00:38:23.475]  But a cartel oligopoly is the same thing, just with different partners in the syndicate.
[00:38:25.377 --> 00:38:27.620]  Now, this is admitted.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.823]  This should have been national news forever.
[00:38:29.883 --> 00:38:31.465]  It should be national news right now.
[00:38:31.545 --> 00:38:32.266]  But just like...
[00:38:33.354 --> 00:38:42.436]  We have the case of it being admitted that Vicente Fox and Bush hired a Dallas PR firm, Rob Allen & Co., top PR firm in the country.
[00:38:43.056 --> 00:38:49.897]  They hired them to stage these demonstrations, to stage the move in Congress to defeat the legislation that would have made them felons.
[00:38:49.917 --> 00:38:50.718]  That's all been defeated.
[00:38:51.318 --> 00:38:55.339]  They've won that battle, but I think the bell they've rung, you can't unring.
[00:38:55.379 --> 00:38:57.199]  People now saw those Mexican flags.
[00:38:57.519 --> 00:39:00.920]  They saw that this is Mexico, this is Aslan signs.
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.240]  People are awake now.
[00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:10.355]  So we've gone from the high 80s to the low 90s in people that are against the La Reconquista and that are now aware of it.
[00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.460]  So it's the same thing.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.383]  We know they went in and bought up the private refineries and shut them down.
[00:39:17.763 --> 00:39:26.388]  Then the oil companies try to spin it and say, well, we have expanded plant capacity, but not to match demand.
[00:39:26.508 --> 00:39:28.709]  Nothing near it at their own plants.
[00:39:28.809 --> 00:39:35.974]  Yes, certainly, once they bought up hundreds and hundreds of privately owned or independent refineries, and it's several hundred,
[00:39:36.734 --> 00:39:42.177]  Sure, they had to now meet the demand for what they'd shut off, but they didn't fully meet that demand.
[00:39:42.617 --> 00:39:44.098]  They artificially did that.
[00:39:44.158 --> 00:39:44.698]  Guaranteed.
[00:39:44.818 --> 00:39:56.464]  Then, you have the fact that oil executives and others have gone public that in Gull Island alone, in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, there is more oil discovered than there is in all of Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:57.535 --> 00:39:58.455]  Where does that oil go?
[00:39:58.475 --> 00:40:02.577]  84% of it is shipped to Japan and China.
[00:40:03.157 --> 00:40:08.840]  America, mainly the West Coast, only gets over a little than 20% of it.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.741]  Canada gets another, what, 6% of it.
[00:40:12.441 --> 00:40:15.022]  So, we have enough oil.
[00:40:15.303 --> 00:40:17.023]  We don't even need new pipelines.
[00:40:17.063 --> 00:40:18.724]  Those pipelines aren't in full capacity.
[00:40:19.804 --> 00:40:21.225]  And then they act like the liberals.
[00:40:21.265 --> 00:40:25.707]  Notice Bush has the House, the Senate, the majority of the governors, the executive.
[00:40:27.265 --> 00:40:34.933]  Congress, what the House passed a law last year allowing, quote, opening up ANWR, it's already open.
[00:40:36.194 --> 00:40:38.537]  And then the Senate shoots it down and Bush didn't do anything.
[00:40:38.557 --> 00:40:41.680]  I mean, he gave a few speeches, but it was theater.
[00:40:43.382 --> 00:40:47.286]  There's a 600 and something square mile area off the coast of Louisiana.
[00:40:48.383 --> 00:40:51.085]  And they're not even allowed to drill there.
[00:40:51.586 --> 00:41:02.034]  The first thing Bush did when he got elected was give thousands of square miles of U.S.-controlled waters to Mexico and Pemex as a deal.
[00:41:03.295 --> 00:41:04.436]  Just Google that.
[00:41:04.516 --> 00:41:05.657]  That was on the news.
[00:41:05.677 --> 00:41:07.258]  It was in the Wall Street Journal at the time.
[00:41:07.699 --> 00:41:14.884]  Bush is like, here, have some of the richest oil reserves in shallow water right off the coast of the U.S.
[00:41:14.924 --> 00:41:15.705]  and northern Mexico.
[00:41:15.985 --> 00:41:16.826]  Here, you just have it.
[00:41:17.586 --> 00:41:18.568]  Thousands of square miles.
[00:41:18.588 --> 00:41:22.574]  600 plus off limits since the 80s.
[00:41:22.854 --> 00:41:24.036]  There's so much oil.
[00:41:24.096 --> 00:41:26.780]  Remember Saddam Hussein in 1990?
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.281]  Remember?
[00:41:27.782 --> 00:41:28.763]  We have memories, folks.
[00:41:28.783 --> 00:41:29.384]  16 years ago,
[00:41:31.312 --> 00:41:34.033]  They were angry at him for, quote, overproducing.
[00:41:34.093 --> 00:41:36.094]  Remember OPEC, the big cartel?
[00:41:36.114 --> 00:41:38.215]  But it's only one part of a larger cartel.
[00:41:38.956 --> 00:41:41.237]  OPEC, the petroleum producers, were mad.
[00:41:41.277 --> 00:41:42.077]  He was overpumping.
[00:41:42.097 --> 00:41:45.899]  And he said, look, I got a $30-something billion weapons bill to the U.S.
[00:41:45.939 --> 00:41:46.399]  and Russia.
[00:41:46.799 --> 00:41:47.960]  I've got to pay this off.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.700]  And they said, stop it.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.001]  You're overproducing.
[00:41:51.401 --> 00:41:54.603]  Remember gas was like 95 cents a gallon then in 1990?
[00:41:58.323 --> 00:42:00.665]  I remember sometimes it was as low as like 82 cents.
[00:42:00.745 --> 00:42:03.988]  I mean, it was because Saddam was pumping.
[00:42:05.429 --> 00:42:07.091]  And it made people angry.
[00:42:08.252 --> 00:42:09.813]  It made them extremely upset.
[00:42:11.375 --> 00:42:23.185]  And so when you see the Exxon chairman getting a $400 million parachute on top of his $200-something million in stock and all the rest of it, look, that's $600-plus million plus the hundreds of millions he was paid before that.
[00:42:23.205 --> 00:42:25.047]  What was he getting, like $40-something million a year?
[00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:30.833]  All those hundreds of millions of dollars, so it's over $600 million, that he gets, that's nothing.
[00:42:31.974 --> 00:42:37.577]  Last year, ExxonMobil had a $36 billion profit.
[00:42:37.778 --> 00:42:40.459]  And that's after they play all their little offshore tax scams.
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.841]  What was the total Big 12 profits?
[00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:44.962]  It was $130-something billion.
[00:42:49.958 --> 00:42:51.099]  I mean, think about that.
[00:42:51.139 --> 00:42:56.082]  In fact, ExxonMobil is about to push Walmart out as the most profitable corporation.
[00:42:56.102 --> 00:43:05.247]  Of course, GM, that actually manufactures something, at least puts the parts together here in the U.S., is on the verge of filing Chapter 11.
[00:43:06.909 --> 00:43:07.969]  That's been all over the news.
[00:43:07.989 --> 00:43:11.591]  I don't know if that's going to happen, but for all intents and purposes, it has.
[00:43:12.412 --> 00:43:13.373]  Ford is plunging.
[00:43:13.413 --> 00:43:14.573]  GM is plunging.
[00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:16.474]  Chrysler is German-owned now.
[00:43:16.955 --> 00:43:18.856]  Toyota just exploded their sales recently.
[00:43:19.722 --> 00:43:22.264]  And it's because, frankly, American cars are junk.
[00:43:23.485 --> 00:43:26.346]  No one respects us enough to even sell us good parts.
[00:43:27.427 --> 00:43:31.110]  America, they know we're fat, dumb, and happy, so we're here to be robbed and looted.
[00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.811]  We're known as the easy mark.
[00:43:32.851 --> 00:43:34.151]  We're known as the suckers.
[00:43:35.873 --> 00:43:42.377]  Once we were feared and known as being a free, strong, vibrant people, you couldn't con, that it was very hard to manipulate us.
[00:43:43.095 --> 00:43:48.718]  But our forefathers and mothers, our forebearers, gave us plenty because they had liberty and plenty always follows.
[00:43:49.219 --> 00:43:52.921]  And we got decadent and now we're being sheared down to the bone.
[00:43:55.363 --> 00:43:56.463]  So I read articles like this.
[00:43:56.563 --> 00:43:57.984]  Oil prices steady near $75 a barrel.
[00:44:00.746 --> 00:44:01.407]  Unbelievable.
[00:44:01.427 --> 00:44:02.768]  So now stabilizing there.
[00:44:02.808 --> 00:44:04.890]  They're saying, though, the London Guardian, it could go over 100.
[00:44:05.251 --> 00:44:06.852]  Big Wall Street analysts are saying that.
[00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:09.375]  House to take out anti-price gouging bill.
[00:44:09.916 --> 00:44:18.364]  Worried about the political heat from high gasoline prices, the House is preparing to vote on a bill that would impose criminal and civil penalties on any energy company caught price gouging.
[00:44:18.384 --> 00:44:22.048]  And they'll bust some little natural gas company or something, I predict.
[00:44:22.068 --> 00:44:22.849]  Something very small.
[00:44:23.926 --> 00:44:26.487]  It'll be big numbers like $10 million in steel.
[00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:28.927]  And the average person goes, man, $10 million is a lot.
[00:44:29.387 --> 00:44:38.230]  The legislation offered by Representative Heather Wilson calls for penalties up to $150 million for refiners and other wholesalers and $2 million for retailers.
[00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.591]  And they'll bust some little Midwest chain.
[00:44:42.611 --> 00:44:47.872]  Because the governors are telling them, they're saying, you can only sell gas at $1.30.
[00:44:48.333 --> 00:44:49.433]  You're allowed $0.04 of profit.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.323]  Well, I mean, again, a retailer should be able to charge whatever they want.
[00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:56.224]  That is free market.
[00:44:57.005 --> 00:45:00.768]  Retailers should be able to charge $500 a gallon if they want.
[00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:03.811]  See, I'm a free marketer.
[00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:15.468]  If you've got hundreds and hundreds of mid-sized gas chains, thousands and thousands of mom-and-pop gas stations and small chains where they own three or four stores.
[00:45:15.908 --> 00:45:17.409]  I have a friend who owns four gas stations.
[00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:19.130]  By the way, they get hammered.
[00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.931]  The oil companies tell them, you're going to pay more.
[00:45:21.411 --> 00:45:24.733]  See, if you broker it and own 200 stations, you get it really cheap.
[00:45:24.913 --> 00:45:30.457]  But you own four stations, the very same trucks bringing you the gas, but you're paying 10, 15 cents a gallon more.
[00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:35.873]  If they pass that on to you, no, no, no.
[00:45:36.313 --> 00:45:46.721]  So they should be able to charge $5 a gallon if they want, because we do have choices, even though the big chains are muscling people out and selling it for cheaper.
[00:45:48.283 --> 00:45:50.144]  They still have a right to do that.
[00:45:50.504 --> 00:45:51.225]  That's free market.
[00:45:51.265 --> 00:45:59.512]  You do not have a right to meet in smoky boardrooms in 1995 and 1996 and collude to create a shortage of refining space.
[00:46:00.092 --> 00:46:01.212]  And refining capacity.
[00:46:02.513 --> 00:46:03.693]  Now, that's the facts.
[00:46:03.733 --> 00:46:06.354]  And I don't want to hear it from the neocons anymore.
[00:46:06.454 --> 00:46:07.314]  I know I will.
[00:46:07.774 --> 00:46:09.134]  The oil companies have done nothing.
[00:46:09.194 --> 00:46:11.035]  It's free market.
[00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:13.936]  The liberal commies are against it.
[00:46:13.996 --> 00:46:17.417]  No, the liberals in Congress are all involved and on the same payroll.
[00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:20.457]  So don't worry.
[00:46:20.497 --> 00:46:22.538]  They're taking up an anti-gouging bill.
[00:46:23.838 --> 00:46:26.219]  Exxon Chiefs says he understands gas woes.
[00:46:27.097 --> 00:46:33.702]  ExxonMobil chairman Rex Tillerson says oil companies do not get together and illegally manipulate oil prices.
[00:46:35.023 --> 00:46:35.563]  Sure you don't.
[00:46:35.603 --> 00:46:36.484]  We just have the memos.
[00:46:37.765 --> 00:46:46.071]  He tells NBC Today that he understands gas prices are causing difficulties for people, but the alternative of no gas or long lines isn't attractive either.
[00:46:46.912 --> 00:46:53.657]  Tillerson pointed out that the price of oil is set on the open commodities market, and the price of the oil pump eventually reflects that.
[00:46:54.975 --> 00:47:03.437]  Yeah, but you've colluded on top of the cartels scamming us, the oil producers, then you have another cartel with a refining space.
[00:47:04.377 --> 00:47:05.197]  That's incredible.
[00:47:05.717 --> 00:47:14.759]  And again, the very same lobbyists that control and manipulate Saudi Arabia and other nations, the very same lobbyists that won't let us have Alaskan oil, are the oil company lobbyists.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.220]  Tillerson pointed out that the price of oil is set in the open commodities market.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.581]  Politicians and the public are looking for ways to deal with the rising gas prices.
[00:47:23.447 --> 00:47:25.429]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in California.
[00:47:25.449 --> 00:47:26.029]  Dave, go ahead.
[00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.990]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.450]  Good morning.
[00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:28.011]  Hello.
[00:47:28.131 --> 00:47:29.232]  I've got some good news for you.
[00:47:30.253 --> 00:47:37.638]  A couple days ago, you guys posted the United Flight 93 Apologist movie on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:45.580]  And so I got online right away and I spent about 30 hours in that forum that United... We didn't post that movie.
[00:47:46.941 --> 00:47:49.603]  I thought I saw a link to it from Prison Planet TV.
[00:47:49.703 --> 00:47:51.904]  You're talking about a link to... A link to the forum.
[00:47:52.244 --> 00:47:53.165]  Yeah, sure.
[00:47:53.185 --> 00:47:55.287]  I mean, the way it came off, I misheard you.
[00:47:55.347 --> 00:47:57.888]  Like, we posted Flight 93, the movie.
[00:47:58.089 --> 00:47:58.369]  No, no.
[00:47:58.449 --> 00:47:58.909]  I didn't mean that.
[00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:00.070]  Anyway, so I went there.
[00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:05.614]  I spent about 30 hours on there under a pseudonym of Algorithm posting stuff about your site's
[00:48:06.484 --> 00:48:09.267]  And I've been watching that and it's been extremely busy.
[00:48:09.287 --> 00:48:13.049]  The first day they actually took it down, I guess they panicked.
[00:48:13.149 --> 00:48:14.330]  Yeah, let me just thank you.
[00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:19.995]  We put a link to Flight 93, this government propaganda piece, put out by Universal.
[00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:30.009]  And so then you guys went and took the forum over, so they shut it down, they brought it back up, and now last time I checked, you'd taken it over again.
[00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.192]  I'd say nine out of ten posts are exposing the inside job.
[00:48:34.452 --> 00:48:35.413]  It's more than that now.
[00:48:35.593 --> 00:48:39.155]  Almost all the people that were arguing, and all the arguments were just ridiculous.
[00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:41.196]  It wasn't even arguments.
[00:48:41.276 --> 00:48:42.877]  It was just spam.
[00:48:42.897 --> 00:48:45.879]  They've almost all given up.
[00:48:46.119 --> 00:48:46.940]  It's almost 100% now truth.
[00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:55.851]  Really, I checked it over the weekend, and literally I'd have to read page after page to find an idiot posting.
[00:48:56.972 --> 00:48:58.473]  How many people are on that forum now?
[00:48:59.194 --> 00:48:59.754]  I don't remember.
[00:48:59.815 --> 00:49:05.960]  The last I saw last night, there had been, I don't remember, it was about 7,000 posts a day.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.262]  Well, I'll tell you what's beautiful.
[00:49:09.634 --> 00:49:21.486]  Is the fact that all over the country, truth seekers, truth tellers, have been out protesting at the opening of the film from New York to Chicago to L.A., and it's been getting on national television.
[00:49:21.526 --> 00:49:22.547]  I mean, that is beautiful.
[00:49:22.908 --> 00:49:23.609]  Yeah, it is.
[00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:25.330]  It's really been something to see.
[00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:31.797]  I mean, you can just watch the opposition dropping out because they just can't stand up to the volume.
[00:49:32.037 --> 00:49:33.278]  Well, they're also sheeple.
[00:49:33.719 --> 00:49:39.864]  So once they see 9 out of 10 posting facts, knowing what they're talking about, they will convert.
[00:49:40.364 --> 00:49:44.988]  Yeah, not only that, they even changed the name from Theories to 9-11, which I thought was kind of cool.
[00:49:45.208 --> 00:49:51.434]  And it looks like the staff of Universal are actually listening and considering what to do next.
[00:49:52.034 --> 00:49:54.717]  They might even keep it open, which would be interesting.
[00:49:54.877 --> 00:49:56.658]  Yeah, at first they deleted all the threads.
[00:49:56.858 --> 00:49:57.319]  That's right.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.680]  Well, that's exciting.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.601]  Listen, I mean, they've had CNN polls.
[00:50:01.641 --> 00:50:03.701]  Do you agree about 9-11 cover-up in 83%?
[00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:06.761]  They've had scientific Zogby, 66%, 50%.
[00:50:08.722 --> 00:50:09.982]  First poll, 50%, now 66%.
[00:50:11.102 --> 00:50:12.463]  They've had other national polls.
[00:50:12.823 --> 00:50:21.764]  AOL had some staged poll that I don't believe with, you know, 70% saying that 9-11 being an inside job is ridiculous.
[00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:25.565]  And I don't know if I even buy that because it doesn't fit with all the other polls we've seen.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:33.465]  Yeah, well, there was a number of polls in that particular forum as well, and every one was running approximately 85 to 90.
[00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:36.106]  It was very consistent.
[00:50:37.087 --> 00:50:37.467]  All right.
[00:50:37.527 --> 00:50:38.228]  Anything else, sir?
[00:50:38.508 --> 00:50:39.248]  Oh, well, one more thing.
[00:50:39.268 --> 00:50:41.209]  It's getting hard to get on your show, and I like that.
[00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.351]  So good job, man.
[00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:45.712]  Keep up the good work and keep the faith.
[00:50:45.912 --> 00:50:47.153]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:47.534 --> 00:50:51.256]  Yeah, you can always get in on the show because we don't open the phones up until I'm taking calls.
[00:50:52.108 --> 00:50:56.250]  So normally you can call in, you know, right when I start taking calls and load the lines up.
[00:50:56.791 --> 00:50:59.312]  You try to call once we're taking calls, it's hard.

[00:54:01.483 --> 00:54:14.189]  Barry Anderson, an American who's been warning about the invasion and the anti-Americanism of some of the leadership.
[00:54:14.961 --> 00:54:17.684]  Most of the leadership of the illegal alien controllers.
[00:54:19.166 --> 00:54:21.348]  And so we'll be talking with him in the next hour.
[00:54:21.368 --> 00:54:22.930]  We're going to take calls in this segment in the next
[00:54:24.272 --> 00:54:33.758]  Before I do that, again, I just want to encourage you to visit the online video and bookstore and the secure online shopping cart at infowars.com.

[00:54:49.407 --> 00:54:50.528]  Pro-gun t-shirts.
[00:54:50.928 --> 00:54:52.089]  Because being pro-gun is liberal now.
[00:54:52.149 --> 00:54:52.530]  Remember that.
[00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:57.393]  You need to go to InfoWars.com because these are excellent films.
[00:54:57.433 --> 00:54:58.113]  They're dynamic.

[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.861]  I believe a rising tide raises all ships.
[00:55:19.961 --> 00:55:21.382]  I want everyone to be successful.
[00:55:21.782 --> 00:55:25.724]  Some of the so-called patriots get absolutely jealous of anyone else's success.
[00:55:26.244 --> 00:55:33.087]  I'm glad Loose Change 2nd Edition is in USA Today and on CNN and that they're selling it like hotcakes.
[00:55:33.287 --> 00:55:34.188]  That makes me happy.
[00:55:34.688 --> 00:55:37.909]  But I also want to see Martial Law be very successful.

[00:56:02.778 --> 00:56:05.519]  All right, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:56:05.919 --> 00:56:07.499]  Richard in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[00:56:07.959 --> 00:56:08.579]  You're welcome.
[00:56:08.679 --> 00:56:09.480]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.940]  Listen, a couple questions.
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.061]  You spoke of all these detention camps they got all over the U.S.
[00:56:14.961 --> 00:56:16.641]  Supposedly they're going to be used for us.
[00:56:17.061 --> 00:56:23.623]  Why aren't they rounding up these people and putting them in these camps and holding them until some kind of program is resolved?
[00:56:24.076 --> 00:56:25.457]  This is just getting out of hand.
[00:56:25.857 --> 00:56:33.019]  Well, sir, they're very sophisticated, and I don't know if you're a regular listener, but in 1986, a 1984 plan called Rex 84 was leaked to Miami papers, and Congress had hearings on it.
[00:56:39.942 --> 00:56:50.826]  And Jack Brooks and others and Henry B. Gonzalez admitted they were going to use the camp construction as a smoke screen and say it was for illegals, but it was really for American citizens.
[00:56:51.266 --> 00:56:53.747]  Now the Houston Chronicle has reported just that.
[00:56:53.827 --> 00:57:02.730]  So they are implementing Rex 84, and so they'll put a few illegals in these camps before deportation if the feds are able to stage riots.
[00:57:03.331 --> 00:57:05.591]  So they're trying to set the illegals up right now.
[00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:07.252]  I hope the illegals aren't that dumb.
[00:57:07.632 --> 00:57:09.294]  Well, I hope so, too.
[00:57:09.314 --> 00:57:10.815]  A couple other things I want to hit on.
[00:57:10.935 --> 00:57:12.436]  I'm glad you mentioned the thing with Alaska.
[00:57:12.516 --> 00:57:13.497]  I was curious at that.
[00:57:13.858 --> 00:57:15.039]  Why is the oil going there?
[00:57:15.059 --> 00:57:15.999]  Why don't it go here?
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:22.385]  And another thing, we just found out that off of Cuba, the Chinese are going to be putting the oil rigs in.
[00:57:23.191 --> 00:57:24.671]  No, I don't know how they're getting away with that.
[00:57:24.711 --> 00:57:26.072]  They have a spill over there.
[00:57:26.112 --> 00:57:29.012]  It's going to wipe out Florida and the whole coast there.
[00:57:29.052 --> 00:57:29.712]  Well, that's right.
[00:57:29.972 --> 00:57:30.492]  The U.S.
[00:57:30.532 --> 00:57:37.193]  has agreements with the state of Florida not to drill there within hundreds of miles of those beaches.
[00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:38.974]  But don't worry.
[00:57:39.334 --> 00:57:41.074]  China is, and that's okay.
[00:57:41.114 --> 00:57:47.115]  And then Bush gave Mexico five years ago over 2,000 square miles of premium drilling area.
[00:57:47.395 --> 00:57:49.616]  Yeah, but remember what happened to the Exxon Valdez.
[00:57:49.636 --> 00:57:51.416]  You know, that went more than 200 miles.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:52.680]  I know.
[00:57:52.941 --> 00:57:53.701]  I understand.
[00:57:53.741 --> 00:57:56.242]  The Chinese get the oil just like they do from Alaska.
[00:57:56.302 --> 00:57:56.803]  We don't.
[00:57:57.163 --> 00:57:57.383]  Yeah.
[00:57:57.403 --> 00:58:01.525]  I don't know if you knew, but the people in Alaska, every year they get a check from the oil companies.
[00:58:01.625 --> 00:58:05.307]  I guess that's like a bribe or restitution for what?
[00:58:06.468 --> 00:58:06.848]  They do.
[00:58:06.888 --> 00:58:08.369]  They do get a check for the state.
[00:58:08.769 --> 00:58:09.030]  Okay.
[00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.050]  Another thing I want to hit on.
[00:58:10.831 --> 00:58:12.151]  We've been listening to a lot of the shows.
[00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:15.213]  You know, Steve Coyle, all the guys, Alex, Derry Brownfield.
[00:58:15.857 --> 00:58:16.758]  It's hard to get through.
[00:58:17.138 --> 00:58:22.483]  Okay, the government claims they don't have enough personnel for documentation of illegals, okay?
[00:58:22.984 --> 00:58:29.049]  But they also seem to have enough people for monitoring the ID chipping of all livestock.
[00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:33.273]  That's right, which will take hundreds of thousands of monitors.
[00:58:34.314 --> 00:58:35.635]  Sir, that's an excellent point.
[00:58:35.696 --> 00:58:40.240]  Listen, the illegal aliens drive around with their inspection stickers out, pull them over, take them to jail.
[00:58:41.457 --> 00:58:46.300]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:46.780]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:47.741]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.941 --> 00:58:50.542]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:50.622 --> 00:58:54.845]  You want answers?
[00:58:54.905 --> 00:58:56.746]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.073 --> 00:59:10.016]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.276 --> 00:59:14.400]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.441 --> 00:59:21.485]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, it is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:21.505 --> 00:59:29.111]  We've got Terry Anderson, national talk show host, defending our borders, defending our freedoms.
[00:59:30.177 --> 00:59:37.345]  Coming up in the next segment, he's going to be out at Crawford this weekend with Lupe Morano and others protesting the open borders against Lord Bush.
[00:59:37.805 --> 00:59:39.507]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:59:39.547 --> 00:59:43.051]  Let's talk to, I believe, Diane is up next.
[00:59:44.453 --> 00:59:45.754]  Diane, where are you calling us from?
[00:59:45.774 --> 00:59:47.716]  Hi, South Carolina Shortwave.
[00:59:47.916 --> 00:59:51.260]  Alex, this morning someone called me and said, get on your AM real quick.
[00:59:51.807 --> 00:59:56.709]  Michael somebody was doing a talk show and he was really putting down loose change.
[00:59:56.769 --> 00:59:57.410]  And I said, ooh.
[00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:03.072]  So I called in because he was really hitting hard at all these people who believe in conspiracy theories.
[01:00:03.553 --> 01:00:04.613]  Why do they do this?
[01:00:04.693 --> 01:00:05.774]  They're a bunch of nuts.
[01:00:06.454 --> 01:00:07.174]  And I called in.
[01:00:07.254 --> 01:00:14.658]  I said, well, either we've got to think it's a conspiracy or we totally have so much ineptitude in our government it's sad.
[01:00:15.198 --> 01:00:21.001]  And I started talking about the different things going on, you know, with Project Bojinka because they said there was no idea that
[01:00:21.403 --> 01:00:22.044]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:00:34.628 --> 01:00:41.790]  And I said, and what about Gary Hart speaking in front of the CFR that they needed a catalyst like this, like Pearl Harbor?
[01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:43.990]  Cut me right off.
[01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:47.051]  So you were never able to get an Infowars.com in?
[01:00:47.491 --> 01:00:47.831]  Never.
[01:00:48.251 --> 01:00:49.532]  They cut me off time.
[01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:54.093]  I started reeling off stuff that documented what he was going against.
[01:00:54.493 --> 01:01:02.475]  So another lady called in and she said, well, you know, I saw the movie and she said it really made me start to question
[01:01:03.135 --> 01:01:11.818]  The ideas that the regular media has handed out to us because, and then she brought up about, he was putting out, well, where could they have sent the planes?
[01:01:11.898 --> 01:01:12.618]  Where were the people?
[01:01:12.998 --> 01:01:16.219]  She said, well, there's documentation that two landed in Cleveland.
[01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:17.459]  I don't know where they would have sent them.
[01:01:17.479 --> 01:01:19.100]  He said, oh, I understand.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.181]  They have them in underground NASA bunkers.
[01:01:21.521 --> 01:01:24.522]  She said, well, probably so because aren't they going to send a bunch of us there?
[01:01:24.622 --> 01:01:25.742]  Isn't that what y'all have been telling us?
[01:01:26.195 --> 01:01:29.576]  I mean, they were just so... Well, do me a favor.
[01:01:29.636 --> 01:01:33.017]  Call back in tomorrow because, again, I'm really excited that Loose Change is gone.
[01:01:33.037 --> 01:01:35.638]  It is getting it out here on the AMFN station now.
[01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:38.239]  Well, I was about to say, it's gone supernuclear.
[01:01:38.639 --> 01:01:47.161]  I need you, the listeners, to call in and promote martial law, 9-11, rise of the police state because it... And I carry Loose Change, too.
[01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.962]  You can get it from us right now, folks, DVD.
[01:01:49.022 --> 01:01:50.582]  Alex, they just cut us off time.
[01:01:50.622 --> 01:01:53.443]  We start spouting off, and then they'll let somebody else talk this in.
[01:01:53.903 --> 01:01:56.325]  Oh, well, you know, this is a bunch of bonkers.
[01:01:56.785 --> 01:01:58.987]  Nobody that's giving evidence, they let this go.
[01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:05.452]  But the good news is people hear the names, they still go out and check it out, they learn on their own.
[01:02:06.653 --> 01:02:07.593]  Thank you so much.
[01:02:07.674 --> 01:02:08.194]  God bless.
[01:02:08.574 --> 01:02:09.015]  Thank you.
[01:02:09.195 --> 01:02:12.757]  And seriously, folks, the power of the web.
[01:02:12.817 --> 01:02:18.261]  We have posted, that is Google Video has, so we link to it, also is InternetArchive.org.
[01:02:18.962 --> 01:02:21.564]  They both have it posted, Marshall Loft.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:28.182]  Which, in about an hour and 20 minutes of a three-hour film, is the most in-depth 9-11 info you're ever going to see.
[01:02:28.902 --> 01:02:45.968]  And we go at it from the angle of Bin Laden's a CIA asset, public officials warn not to fly, NORAD drills that day, bombs in the buildings, the controlled demolition, the firefighters, Cheney in the bunker, the stand-down order.
[01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:53.642]  Marvin Bush on the board of directors of the security company of the World Trade Centers.
[01:02:54.983 --> 01:02:58.626]  There's different films that cover different angles, and martial law is so important.
[01:02:59.545 --> 01:03:05.148]  So please go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or JonesReport.com and get it right now.
[01:03:05.608 --> 01:03:07.469]  Send it to your whole email list, that article.
[01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:08.990]  It's an article with a link in it.
[01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:13.112]  And tell them, download it, post it on MySpace, get it out to everybody.
[01:03:13.152 --> 01:03:15.973]  And get other 9-11 films and do the same thing.
[01:03:16.013 --> 01:03:17.514]  People have done that with Loose Change 2.
[01:03:18.054 --> 01:03:21.856]  That's why I think they see over 3 million downloads on Google Video alone.
[01:03:23.057 --> 01:03:25.218]  And see, I didn't even know martial law was on Google Video.
[01:03:26.019 --> 01:03:28.201]  Somebody just sent me a link and said, hey, this is here too.
[01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:28.841]  You need to promote it.
[01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:29.782]  So we are.
[01:03:30.442 --> 01:03:30.982]  It's free.
[01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:31.983]  It's there.
[01:03:32.443 --> 01:03:39.988]  Now, if you want a high-quality DVD copy, which also makes this broadcast possible, go get that and then burn copies of it and give it to people.
[01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:44.611]  The power of you getting the originals and making copies is just unbelievable.
[01:03:45.312 --> 01:03:46.753]  So it's all available right now.
[01:03:46.853 --> 01:03:47.113]  Get it.
[01:03:47.233 --> 01:03:48.854]  Buy a copy or download it for free.
[01:03:49.194 --> 01:03:50.255]  Just get it out there.
[01:03:50.315 --> 01:03:51.236]  Get it out there now.
[01:03:54.972 --> 01:03:57.814]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.074 --> 01:03:59.655]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.995 --> 01:04:04.678]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:11.743]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.063 --> 01:04:14.043]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.264 --> 01:04:17.104]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.204 --> 01:04:21.845]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.065 --> 01:04:26.446]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.706 --> 01:04:33.928]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.168 --> 01:04:36.589]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:38.489]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:04:38.609 --> 01:04:41.970]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:46.632]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:57.341]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:57.401 --> 01:05:01.604]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:01.844 --> 01:05:04.626]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:04.806 --> 01:05:07.228]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:07.408 --> 01:05:16.053]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:16.253 --> 01:05:17.594]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:17.794 --> 01:05:21.937]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:22.197 --> 01:05:22.718]  We're good to go.
[01:05:41.277 --> 01:05:42.798]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:42.818 --> 01:05:44.900]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.162]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:05:47.262 --> 01:05:47.823]  New toenails?
[01:05:47.963 --> 01:05:50.105]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:05:50.145 --> 01:05:54.268]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:06.322]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:06:06.342 --> 01:06:09.124]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[01:06:09.344 --> 01:06:10.725]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:06:10.745 --> 01:06:12.846]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:06:13.007 --> 01:06:14.367]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:06:14.407 --> 01:06:17.209]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:18.690]  Well, here's my secret.
[01:06:19.251 --> 01:06:20.291]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:20.772 --> 01:06:24.855]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[01:06:25.555 --> 01:06:26.456]  Ah, so that's it.
[01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:29.258]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[01:06:29.538 --> 01:06:31.159]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:34.740]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:35.680]  You bet.
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:40.001]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[01:06:40.142 --> 01:06:41.682]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:06:42.062 --> 01:06:43.202]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:06:43.382 --> 01:06:45.043]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[01:06:45.403 --> 01:06:50.505]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[01:06:50.705 --> 01:06:51.705]  In the foot care section.
[01:06:54.804 --> 01:07:00.826]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.426 --> 01:07:04.468]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:09.590]  Well, we've been interviewing him for, I don't know, six, seven years.
[01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:15.372]  He's a great American, very fiery, has the best immigration show I've heard bar none, does it every weekend.
[01:07:15.812 --> 01:07:18.153]  I get to hear it locally here on one of the local stations, 100.1.
[01:07:20.234 --> 01:07:36.091]  And he's Terry Anderson, and Terry, before we go to you, my friend, I want to play this blasphemous, treacherous little three-minute clip of the Star Spangled Banner in Spanish, but I have the lyrics here.
[01:07:37.692 --> 01:07:38.892]  They changed the lyrics.
[01:07:38.932 --> 01:07:40.153]  They make fun of America.
[01:07:40.173 --> 01:07:41.433]  It doesn't even sound like it.
[01:07:42.073 --> 01:07:52.216]  And Bush says that he's against it, but then I have Bush on video singing it in Spanish in 2004 during the election in Milwaukee and waving a Mexican flag.
[01:07:52.596 --> 01:07:54.776]  They're globalists, Democrats and Republicans.
[01:07:55.036 --> 01:07:55.956]  They love what's happening.
[01:07:56.157 --> 01:07:57.937]  Let's roll this, and we'll go to Terry Anderson.
[01:08:01.863 --> 01:08:06.105]  Latinos, Latinas, hermanos y hermanas.
[01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.066]  Yo soy un latino, papá.
[01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:18.510]  Amanecer lo ve a la luz de la aurora lo que tanto aclamamos
[01:08:27.518 --> 01:08:45.109]  La noche al caer Sus estrellas Sus trancas Lloraban ayer En el viento combate El señal de ayer
[01:09:00.138 --> 01:09:01.138]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:26.818 --> 01:09:28.840]  Yeah.
[01:09:29.702 --> 01:09:30.583]  Yeah.
[01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:51.914]  My people keep fighting!
[01:10:17.533 --> 01:10:20.396]  I guess just let it play out.
[01:10:20.476 --> 01:10:22.558]  I said I would.
[01:10:50.223 --> 01:10:50.805]  All right, folks.
[01:10:50.865 --> 01:10:51.928]  Genesis Communications.
[01:10:52.008 --> 01:10:53.311]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:10:53.472 --> 01:10:54.654]  Terry Anderson's our guest.
[01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:58.942]  Now, if you listen to that, it starts out with Latin father, Latino father.
[01:10:58.982 --> 01:11:00.383]  So it's saying to our fathers.
[01:11:00.943 --> 01:11:05.504]  And in the news, they only list the main lyrics.
[01:11:05.564 --> 01:11:11.226]  But if you listen to it, what's going on under it, it's lots of, on top of it, little aggressive comments.
[01:11:11.286 --> 01:11:13.807]  And when you read it, we have the text on Infowars.com.
[01:11:14.307 --> 01:11:16.768]  It's really a revolutionary La Reconquista song.
[01:11:17.168 --> 01:11:20.129]  Terry Anderson, was your stomach turning during that?
[01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:21.849]  Made me want to vomit.
[01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:24.550]  Absolutely want to vomit, Alex.
[01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:30.368]  I mean, we're living in the twilight zone.
[01:11:30.388 --> 01:11:32.509]  Terry Anderson, a lot has happened.
[01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:35.110]  Everything you said years ago would happen is coming true.
[01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:38.871]  And I think this has blown up into Loree Conquista's face.
[01:11:38.931 --> 01:11:46.814]  I think that they tried to come intimidate the American people, along with Bush's and Fox's Dallas PR firm, and I think it's failed miserably.
[01:11:46.834 --> 01:11:51.315]  Do you think they've inadvertently engaged in Paul Revere's ride?
[01:11:51.755 --> 01:11:53.276]  They have done us a huge service.
[01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:54.504]  You know what, Alex?
[01:11:54.564 --> 01:11:55.925]  Everything they do works for us.
[01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.626]  Everything they say works for us.
[01:11:58.146 --> 01:12:10.095]  If I was running their side of the issue and trying to get what they're trying to get, I would never engage in this in-the-face, out-on-the-street demands for whatever they're demanding.
[01:12:10.135 --> 01:12:12.096]  And this thing with the Star Spangled Banner...
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.442]  I would refuse to play it if I was one of them.
[01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:18.205]  I would say, no, no, no, we don't want any parts of this, and I would disavow any knowledge of it.
[01:12:18.565 --> 01:12:23.249]  But no, these people are so in your face, they think they're so strong now, they think they can do whatever they want.
[01:12:23.549 --> 01:12:26.171]  They think their numbers are so big that they're going to conquer this nation.
[01:12:26.371 --> 01:12:34.058]  They have no idea how many Americans are out here hating them right now, and that number's growing every day with the shenanigans that they pull.
[01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:40.315]  Well, Colonel Al Ramirez and others are going public and saying, hey, you don't speak for us.
[01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:46.820]  And in major polls, most Hispanics, the vast majority, don't like what's happening either.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:47.760]  Absolutely.
[01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:48.801]  And God bless them.
[01:12:49.121 --> 01:12:57.547]  Those are valiant Americans just like you and I who understand the need for sovereignty and the need to expel these invaders from our country.
[01:12:58.268 --> 01:13:01.170]  If you lived here in L.A., anybody that's never been to L.A.
[01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:02.411]  doesn't really get it.
[01:13:03.226 --> 01:13:04.606]  This city is over with.
[01:13:04.787 --> 01:13:05.367]  It is through.
[01:13:05.467 --> 01:13:06.007]  It is done.
[01:13:06.067 --> 01:13:12.949]  It will never be an American city again unless they do a retroactive addressing of the 14th Amendment.
[01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:14.530]  They would have to be retroactive.
[01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:15.530]  That's the only way they can do it.
[01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:21.892]  This city has got so many illegal aliens and their jackpot babies living in it now that it's irreversible.
[01:13:21.953 --> 01:13:23.033]  And let me tell you something, Alex.
[01:13:23.413 --> 01:13:25.634]  They are speaking in terms of revolution now.
[01:13:25.674 --> 01:13:29.095]  They're speaking in terms of expelling all white Americans
[01:13:29.545 --> 01:13:30.948]  We're good to go.
[01:13:41.574 --> 01:13:55.402]  Shuffle and jive Negroes who have aligned themselves with them like Earl O'Farre Hutchinson and Tony Muhammad and all the messy Jesse Jackson and all the rest of them who are in this city now saying, oh no, these are our brown brothers and we have to align ourselves with them.
[01:13:55.802 --> 01:14:03.546]  Even though they're killing black folks in prisons, they're killing these kids out here in the streets and they're rioting every day against black kids in the schools.
[01:14:03.767 --> 01:14:05.668]  But no, we've got to align ourselves with them.
[01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:06.248]  This thing is...
[01:14:06.588 --> 01:14:07.789]  This thing is getting ready to explode.
[01:14:07.809 --> 01:14:15.573]  By the way, down in Orange County two days ago, they attacked police with bottles, rocks, and marbles, and the cops stood there and took it.
[01:14:16.053 --> 01:14:16.233]  Yep.
[01:14:16.973 --> 01:14:17.914]  Yes, they did.
[01:14:18.114 --> 01:14:21.096]  They always stand and take it because they don't want to offend these people.
[01:14:21.436 --> 01:14:24.717]  These people are the new chosen members of society.
[01:14:24.938 --> 01:14:27.479]  This is the chosen people, and they can do whatever they want.
[01:14:28.118 --> 01:14:33.546]  Well, that's because the big banks, the big money, the big PR firms are going to use them to break down the U.S.
[01:14:33.586 --> 01:14:34.607]  for the American Union.
[01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:35.629]  They openly say they are.
[01:14:35.909 --> 01:14:40.936]  The official CFR document last year, Lou Dobbs even read it on air, says America's going down.
[01:14:41.938 --> 01:14:43.480]  Well, I think it has gone down.
[01:14:43.965 --> 01:14:44.466]  I really do.
[01:14:44.506 --> 01:14:45.527]  And I'm going to tell you something.
[01:14:45.907 --> 01:14:47.549]  The time to stand up for this is now.
[01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:54.698]  I said years ago, and there was people saying it before me, George Putnam and Glenn Spencer and Barbara Cole, they were right on the money with this thing.
[01:14:55.198 --> 01:14:59.083]  This thing has gotten to the point now where it is just totally out of hand.
[01:14:59.183 --> 01:15:01.826]  Not irreversible for the country, irreversible for Los Angeles.
[01:15:01.886 --> 01:15:02.887]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:15:02.907 --> 01:15:05.029]  Yeah, but that's a beachhead, an invasion port.
[01:15:05.349 --> 01:15:05.610]  Sure.
[01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.473]  Let me ask you a question, because you've been living around this.
[01:15:08.493 --> 01:15:09.373]  You've witnessed it.
[01:15:09.414 --> 01:15:11.576]  You've lived there in the black neighborhoods.
[01:15:11.676 --> 01:15:14.038]  I mean, you organically saw this happen.
[01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:23.247]  I mean, why do such a large portion of these illegal aliens hate America so much when Mexico is such a police state and they have no freedom?
[01:15:23.688 --> 01:15:25.870]  I have an opinion on that, and that's that they're cowards.
[01:15:26.368 --> 01:15:28.430]  These people take the path of least resistance.
[01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:34.434]  You'd think they would stay home and try to do what they do here, there, march in the streets, protest, change the national anthem.
[01:15:34.494 --> 01:15:34.674]  No.
[01:15:35.154 --> 01:15:40.038]  They come here because we, as a citizenry, we allow this.
[01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:41.539]  We allow them to come here.
[01:15:41.759 --> 01:15:43.340]  This is the path of least resistance.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.321]  And they hate us.
[01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:48.584]  They basically hate us because they think we owe them something, and we don't owe them nothing.
[01:15:48.784 --> 01:15:50.205]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[01:15:50.265 --> 01:15:52.687]  I mean, I had Lieutenant Colonel...
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:59.127]  Well, actually, full Colonel Al Ramirez on, and I hadn't really studied the zoot suits.
[01:15:59.147 --> 01:16:10.562]  I knew a little bit about it, but he reminded me that the illegal aliens in the 40s and 50s viciously attacked servicemen, black, white, and Hispanic, in L.A., and that the servicemen, literally in huge mobs, had to go fight them off.
[01:16:11.242 --> 01:16:13.805]  And he said Mexico is racist, and I knew that.
[01:16:13.925 --> 01:16:17.087]  I knew that they have horrible names for the Indian population.
[01:16:17.107 --> 01:16:19.890]  I know they call blacks mayatas or blackbird.
[01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:24.073]  I know that all of this is going on.
[01:16:24.093 --> 01:16:26.896]  I know, I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[01:16:28.177 --> 01:16:29.198]  You know, it's hard to say.
[01:16:30.579 --> 01:16:32.680]  I think that they are a racist society.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:37.044]  You know, a lot of people say America's a racist society, but I think they're a little more racist than we are.
[01:16:37.064 --> 01:16:38.224]  I've been all over Mexico, Alex.
[01:16:38.665 --> 01:16:42.207]  I've been to Veracruz, where they have a large black population.
[01:16:42.267 --> 01:16:44.229]  Not black as we would see here in the United States.
[01:16:44.676 --> 01:16:48.618]  But you can look at the features, the hair, the noses, you know, the way they're built.
[01:16:48.658 --> 01:16:52.160]  You can see that there was a black influence in the people, if you know what I mean.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.282]  And those people there have the least of the least, the bottom of the bottom.
[01:16:56.662 --> 01:17:00.384]  They get the worst jobs, if any, and they're treated with disdain.
[01:17:00.564 --> 01:17:02.025]  Well, look at Spanish TV.
[01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:04.426]  All the stars have got blonde hair, blue eyes.
[01:17:04.546 --> 01:17:05.327]  I was getting ready to say it.
[01:17:05.347 --> 01:17:06.588]  Watch the novellas.
[01:17:06.608 --> 01:17:08.389]  Watch the Spanish soap operas and see what you see.
[01:17:08.429 --> 01:17:09.169]  You see white folks.
[01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:11.231]  Nothing but white folks.
[01:17:11.331 --> 01:17:12.612]  So you've got a ruling class.
[01:17:12.652 --> 01:17:17.836]  If you go look at the Mexican Congress online, like half of them are Jones, Schmidt, Berger.
[01:17:18.276 --> 01:17:23.000]  So they're white and Jewish ruling them, and then their people still love that and hate America.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:23.801]  There you go.
[01:17:24.721 --> 01:17:33.068]  And every time we want to enforce our laws to the extent, just to the extent that they enforce their laws, they call us racist.
[01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:35.197]  And I applaud Mexico on that.
[01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.498]  I mean, they're very hypocritical.
[01:17:36.698 --> 01:17:38.619]  But I applaud the way they enforce their border.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.501]  I applaud the way they enforce their voting.
[01:17:40.801 --> 01:17:45.384]  I applaud the way they don't let foreigners get jobs here.
[01:17:45.524 --> 01:17:49.006]  I applaud the way they don't let foreigners buy prime property there.
[01:17:49.066 --> 01:17:49.546]  I applaud it.
[01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:50.467]  We should be the same way.
[01:17:50.727 --> 01:17:53.389]  But no, when we try to do exactly what they've done,
[01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:55.546]  The hypocrisy comes out.
[01:17:55.566 --> 01:17:58.209]  Well, they've got an elite there trying to keep control of their country.
[01:17:58.429 --> 01:17:58.989]  And it's working.
[01:17:59.069 --> 01:18:01.752]  They've got triple the resources we've got, but their people get none of it.
[01:18:01.792 --> 01:18:03.914]  Why don't their people go down there and have a real revolution?
[01:18:03.934 --> 01:18:04.835]  Because they're cowards.
[01:18:05.836 --> 01:18:06.496]  They are cowards.
[01:18:07.157 --> 01:18:07.677]  That is why.
[01:18:07.798 --> 01:18:16.145]  And so Americans are a bunch of liberal saps because we did do wrong in the past, so we went overboard the other direction, and so now they see an easy mark.
[01:18:16.506 --> 01:18:16.606]  Yep.
[01:18:17.918 --> 01:18:18.138]  Yep.
[01:18:18.378 --> 01:18:19.279]  They see an easy mark.
[01:18:19.319 --> 01:18:23.101]  They figure we're just going to let them do whatever they want.
[01:18:23.501 --> 01:18:24.722]  And basically, we have.
[01:18:25.062 --> 01:18:28.164]  Well, Terry Anderson, you know, I grew up right here in Texas.
[01:18:28.184 --> 01:18:29.444]  A lot of black and Hispanic friends.
[01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.826]  I've got to tell you, we didn't have a racism problem.
[01:18:31.846 --> 01:18:35.108]  It was almost unheard of, at least where I lived, in Dallas.
[01:18:35.888 --> 01:18:38.852]  But I've got to tell you, I hear a lot about it now.
[01:18:38.912 --> 01:18:40.474]  This is actually creating division.
[01:18:40.494 --> 01:18:41.175]  Would you agree with that?
[01:18:41.395 --> 01:18:42.016]  Absolutely.
[01:18:42.196 --> 01:18:42.757]  Well, stay there.
[01:18:42.797 --> 01:18:43.858]  We'll be right back after the break.
[01:18:43.878 --> 01:18:50.446]  I'm going to talk about the reckoning coming up this weekend out in Crawford, Texas, how you can get involved with Terry Anderson, a great American hero.
[01:18:50.906 --> 01:18:52.829]  We'll continue to fight the invasion on the other side.
[01:18:54.685 --> 01:18:57.669]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[01:19:31.694 --> 01:19:36.158]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:20:56.014 --> 01:20:57.655]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:20:58.256 --> 01:21:00.077]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:01.177 --> 01:21:09.062]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:21:09.302 --> 01:21:11.924]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:21:11.904 --> 01:21:13.345]  's patented methodology.
[01:21:13.485 --> 01:21:20.449]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:21:20.689 --> 01:21:23.671]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:21:24.031 --> 01:21:24.511]  We're good to go.
[01:21:24.571 --> 01:21:24.852]  I think?
[01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:54.542]  We're good to go.
[01:22:08.769 --> 01:22:08.929]  I think.
[01:22:31.732 --> 01:22:31.992]  I remember...
[01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:08.992]  Eight, nine years ago, I was invited by the young conservatives at the University of Texas to go give a Texas Independence Day speech.
[01:23:10.593 --> 01:23:17.796]  And I got there, and people dressed up like Aztecs ran up and grabbed the birthday cake and put it in their mouths and spit it on the cake and screamed at us that they were going to get us.
[01:23:17.856 --> 01:23:21.357]  And this wasn't even really a political thing.
[01:23:21.477 --> 01:23:25.339]  And then UT said, we don't allow the celebration of Texas Independence anymore.
[01:23:25.719 --> 01:23:27.280]  They don't officially do it like it's dirty.
[01:23:28.678 --> 01:23:29.159]  Yeah, the Chosen People.
[01:23:50.006 --> 01:23:50.987]  Everybody's afraid of them.
[01:23:51.447 --> 01:23:54.829]  Everybody wants to kiss them, if you know what I mean, to get their vote.
[01:23:54.869 --> 01:23:57.530]  Everybody's thinking we can woo these people to our side.
[01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:59.071]  These people are going to be on their own side.
[01:23:59.091 --> 01:24:01.052]  They're not going to be wooed to anybody's side.
[01:24:01.592 --> 01:24:06.095]  But it seems to me like they have advantages and privileges that we never had as American citizens.
[01:24:06.135 --> 01:24:07.215]  We never will ever have.
[01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:09.757]  These people have a clear shot at everything.
[01:24:10.057 --> 01:24:11.478]  They have crippled this country, Alex.
[01:24:11.498 --> 01:24:15.260]  They have literally crippled this country, not with their demonstrations, but with their presence.
[01:24:16.044 --> 01:24:17.306]  And nobody seems to care.
[01:24:17.687 --> 01:24:18.708]  Everybody wants them here.
[01:24:18.768 --> 01:24:29.746]  But those of us who aren't speaking up, those of us who are Americans are against it, which is like 90% of the country oppose this, but it's the vocal ones who make the world think that it's okay.
[01:24:30.595 --> 01:24:40.300]  Well, the mainstream media tries to collude with the La Reconquistas to shut everybody up, but tens of, what is it, 30-something billion dollars a year in welfare for them.
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.321]  It's like six billion in California alone.
[01:24:42.621 --> 01:24:45.663]  They get first shots at health care.
[01:24:45.703 --> 01:24:47.904]  They get first shots at everything.
[01:24:47.964 --> 01:24:50.365]  Some states give them more tuition than citizens.
[01:24:50.565 --> 01:24:56.308]  There are programs in Los Angeles set up for Hispanic people, period, with a big period at the end.
[01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:58.932]  Hispanic people can get their children.
[01:24:58.952 --> 01:25:02.274]  This is mostly for illegal aliens who don't have other benefits.
[01:25:02.654 --> 01:25:05.156]  They can get their children looked out for after school.
[01:25:05.396 --> 01:25:08.679]  They can get different types of food for their kids.
[01:25:08.899 --> 01:25:13.342]  There's so many programs set up here where they can get loans that we can't get.
[01:25:13.522 --> 01:25:16.064]  There's loans that they can get to buy a house.
[01:25:16.164 --> 01:25:17.325]  I can't get it as an American.
[01:25:17.606 --> 01:25:18.106]  I can't get it.
[01:25:18.366 --> 01:25:20.848]  They can get loans for small businesses that I can't get.
[01:25:21.548 --> 01:25:22.169]  Now, why is that?
[01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:29.495]  It's because the elites have decided to team up with a foreign mass to literally bully this country.
[01:25:29.515 --> 01:25:33.878]  You know, the establishment can push a few buttons, pull a few levers, and every U.S.
[01:25:33.898 --> 01:25:34.939]  city will burn to the ground.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.421]  Let's talk about rioting.
[01:25:37.501 --> 01:25:39.102]  I was getting ready to say that.
[01:25:39.463 --> 01:25:42.845]  This whole thing is about race, Alex.
[01:25:42.865 --> 01:25:46.568]  We already did the disclaimer about the good American citizens who happen to be Hispanic.
[01:25:46.588 --> 01:25:47.509]  We're not talking about them.
[01:25:47.789 --> 01:25:49.010]  We're talking about these demonstrators.
[01:25:49.622 --> 01:25:51.563]  And the illegal aliens that they demonstrate for.
[01:25:51.984 --> 01:25:52.744]  This is about race.
[01:25:53.004 --> 01:25:56.567]  These are the most racist people I have ever met in my life.
[01:25:57.127 --> 01:25:57.487]  Racist.
[01:25:57.687 --> 01:25:59.328]  I mean racist to their bones.
[01:25:59.709 --> 01:26:03.031]  And if you think I'm wrong, you watch what's happening here in Los Angeles schools.
[01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:10.736]  As their population gets, in predominantly black schools, when their population gets to 65-70% at school, the rioting begins.
[01:26:10.776 --> 01:26:14.058]  Now, when it was 65-70% black, there was no rioting.
[01:26:14.864 --> 01:26:16.785]  When it was 90% black, there was no rioting.
[01:26:17.066 --> 01:26:20.128]  When it was 90% white in some of these schools, there was no rioting.
[01:26:20.368 --> 01:26:24.011]  But when they get their percentages up, they start to attack.
[01:26:24.331 --> 01:26:26.532]  And there's going to be riots in the streets, I'm telling you.
[01:26:26.712 --> 01:26:28.674]  And they have already threatened to burn Los Angeles.
[01:26:28.714 --> 01:26:31.116]  Well, you know, maybe that's not such a bad thing.
[01:26:31.156 --> 01:26:34.238]  You know, if that's what it's going to take to wake up the rest of the country, then do it.
[01:26:34.298 --> 01:26:37.660]  Well, I grew up in Dallas, and I had black friends and Hispanic friends.
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.802]  And when I was in the predominantly black neighborhoods...
[01:26:40.502 --> 01:26:40.862]  We're good to go.
[01:26:40.882 --> 01:26:41.283]  We're good to go.
[01:27:05.483 --> 01:27:12.209]  They tell me that we should align ourselves with these people because we're, quote, both, and I hate this word but I'll use it, minorities, unquote.
[01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:16.553]  What I tell them is, okay, fine, you say he's your brown brother.
[01:27:17.133 --> 01:27:18.194]  Do two things for me.
[01:27:18.735 --> 01:27:19.696]  Go to East L.A.
[01:27:20.116 --> 01:27:23.319]  and attempt to buy a house and see if he's your brother.
[01:27:23.719 --> 01:27:27.983]  Secondly, when you find out you can't buy it, get a Hispanic to buy it for you.
[01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:29.129]  We're good to go.
[01:27:48.991 --> 01:27:51.893]  Three weeks later, they burned his car, and four weeks later, they burned the house.
[01:27:52.173 --> 01:27:53.433]  This has happened in Azusa.
[01:27:53.734 --> 01:27:55.515]  Two black men were killed in Highland Park.
[01:27:55.555 --> 01:27:57.636]  By the way, that's now happening in southern Arizona.
[01:27:57.816 --> 01:27:59.397]  Sure.
[01:27:59.417 --> 01:28:04.980]  One mile north of downtown L.A., two black men on separate occasions were killed just for being black.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.161]  All they did was get out of their cars, and they were shot.
[01:28:07.681 --> 01:28:11.143]  No gangs, no nothing, no robbery, just shot because they were black.
[01:28:11.183 --> 01:28:13.103]  The guys were apprehended, but the guys are still dead.
[01:28:13.223 --> 01:28:16.945]  It seems to me that the Lurican Kistas hate blacks even more than whites.
[01:28:17.145 --> 01:28:21.907]  Oh, well, you know, I debated a woman once from Churla, which is the... Well, stay there.
[01:28:21.927 --> 01:28:23.187]  I want to hear about it on the other side, Terry.
[01:28:23.207 --> 01:28:23.467]  Sure.
[01:28:24.028 --> 01:28:25.548]  This is so important, Terry Anderson.
[01:28:25.568 --> 01:28:26.509]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[01:28:26.569 --> 01:28:28.910]  I mean, it's hard for me to go on the air and talk about this.
[01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:32.611]  Slowly but surely, I've made myself because I love this country.
[01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:34.532]  I mean, I can't believe... I just want to live in peace.
[01:28:35.919 --> 01:28:37.139]  I just want to be left alone.
[01:28:37.199 --> 01:28:38.540]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520]  It's unbelievable.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.760]  We'll be right back with Terry Anderson to tell you about his website and a lot more.
[01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:45.161]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.621 --> 01:28:47.241]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:50.922]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:57.803]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:28:57.943 --> 01:29:04.444]  Did you know that one goal of international communism was to get our young people's mind off religion by getting them on to sex?
[01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:15.271]  By destroying the morals of the younger generation, America would eventually become ripe for revolution without understanding why communism wanted to make young people soft and easily controlled.
[01:29:16.357 --> 01:29:16.797]  We're good to go.
[01:29:45.787 --> 01:29:46.349]  Call now.
[01:29:46.369 --> 01:29:49.199]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:29:52.096 --> 01:29:56.697]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:29:56.897 --> 01:30:01.339]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:30:01.539 --> 01:30:15.543]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:30:15.783 --> 01:30:16.203]  We're good to go.
[01:30:44.474 --> 01:30:45.977]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:46.037 --> 01:30:47.239]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:52.156 --> 01:30:56.779]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:30:56.839 --> 01:30:57.560]  have diabetes.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:04.845]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:31:04.985 --> 01:31:09.508]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:31:09.728 --> 01:31:12.550]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:31:55.394 --> 01:32:00.535]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:01.216 --> 01:32:03.576]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:04.817 --> 01:32:10.779]  Lupe Moreno, who's running for the 34th State Senate District, I'll tell you about that, joins us in the next hour.
[01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:14.921]  And the website's latinoamericans.org.
[01:32:15.801 --> 01:32:18.062]  And they are very upset about what's happening.
[01:32:18.082 --> 01:32:21.663]  And let me state this for the record, and we're going to go back to our guest.
[01:32:22.748 --> 01:32:26.613]  Well, I'll just state it after Terry has a chance to finish his story.
[01:32:26.753 --> 01:32:42.712]  Before we go back to Terry Anderson and tell you about his talk show and his website and the reckoning that's coming up this weekend in Crawford, just about 60 miles from where I sit right now, out there by Bush's Ranch, grab a pen and paper because I'm going to tell you about two important things.
[01:32:43.593 --> 01:32:45.455]  The water is full of poison.
[01:32:45.535 --> 01:32:51.259]  Herbicides, pesticides, motor oil, the chlorine only kills the bacteria so you're drinking.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:56.844]  Dead amoebas, some of the amoeba cysts can be passed and you get parasites.
[01:32:56.924 --> 01:33:01.708]  What about 37% of Americans when they're tested have these parasites already and don't know it.
[01:33:02.608 --> 01:33:06.792]  Your body is 73% water of your female, 71% of your male.
[01:33:07.212 --> 01:33:09.254]  Most of the toxins you ingest are through the water.
[01:33:10.137 --> 01:33:11.697]  You also breathe it in the shower.
[01:33:11.757 --> 01:33:13.578]  It is so poisonous in major cities.
[01:33:14.018 --> 01:33:16.399]  Most well water is toxic.
[01:33:16.799 --> 01:33:18.239]  There are so many problems.
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:21.220]  We have made in America big Berkeys.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:26.622]  With the new black Berkey element even stronger, it cuts everything out to non-detectable levels.
[01:33:26.642 --> 01:33:35.985]  That means under an electron microscope, after they put even swamp water, they call it long growth, that means green water, through these when they've tested them, major universities have.
[01:33:36.025 --> 01:33:37.245]  They have it on their website, the test.
[01:33:37.925 --> 01:33:43.129]  An electron microscope, a week later, giving it time to grow, can find nothing.
[01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:46.972]  They have an added filter that goes on the spigot that even cuts out the fluoride.
[01:33:47.413 --> 01:33:49.434]  Reverse osmosis doesn't even cut out all the fluoride.
[01:33:49.454 --> 01:33:50.595]  It's something like 95%.
[01:33:51.156 --> 01:33:52.637]  So these are the best you can get.
[01:33:52.757 --> 01:33:53.878]  Made in America.
[01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:57.459]  It is so important to give them a call.
[01:33:57.559 --> 01:33:58.880]  And they've got sports bottles.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:00.442]  They've got the big stainless steel units.
[01:34:00.462 --> 01:34:03.145]  They've got them from $25 up to $259.
[01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:05.207]  They've got so many specials.
[01:34:05.267 --> 01:34:06.688]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:34:06.788 --> 01:34:08.390]  We have them on the secure online shopping cart.
[01:34:08.690 --> 01:34:10.071]  We fax the orders to them each day.
[01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:11.393]  They ship it out to you UPS.
[01:34:12.805 --> 01:34:17.247]  You can also call them directly, 1-888-803-4438.
[01:34:18.288 --> 01:34:21.629]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:34:21.749 --> 01:34:27.592]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com and tell them what free gift you want with your order there in the comments section.
[01:34:27.612 --> 01:34:34.455]  When you go to InfoWaters.com, on the left-hand side, there's a banner to New Millennium Concepts and the Big Berkeys.
[01:34:34.815 --> 01:34:37.877]  They also have British made if you prefer those, but the Americans are even better.
[01:34:38.217 --> 01:34:40.900]  This is the big national manufacturer, the big national distributor.
[01:34:41.161 --> 01:34:42.602]  You're getting wholesale prices.
[01:34:42.642 --> 01:34:48.269]  A $200 unit, a $195 unit is $300 plus bucks in a camping supply store.
[01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:55.938]  Believe me, I bought these before they were sponsors from people that weren't the manufacturers or the main distributors and paid over $100 more.
[01:34:56.698 --> 01:34:57.860]  We use this in the office.
[01:34:58.701 --> 01:34:59.641]  It is so good.
[01:35:00.202 --> 01:35:01.282]  Your food tastes better.
[01:35:01.642 --> 01:35:02.942]  It's safer than bottled water.
[01:35:02.962 --> 01:35:03.723]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:35:04.143 --> 01:35:09.124]  If their lines are busy, leave your name and number.
[01:35:09.144 --> 01:35:09.965]  They'll call you right back.
[01:35:09.985 --> 01:35:11.785]  They're great folks.
[01:35:11.805 --> 01:35:13.186]  888-803-4438.
[01:35:13.466 --> 01:35:20.508]  And then, last but not least, we're carrying Loose Change 2nd Edition that is sending shockwaves across the country.
[01:35:20.588 --> 01:35:26.510]  Such a powerfully produced cinematic experience with all the real questions about what really happened on 9-11.
[01:35:28.084 --> 01:35:31.345]  You may have seen it online, but that is a shadow of the film itself.
[01:35:31.705 --> 01:35:33.226]  Get a high quality DVD.
[01:35:33.306 --> 01:35:33.926]  We carry it.
[01:35:34.426 --> 01:35:36.047]  We have it at a discounted price.
[01:35:36.667 --> 01:35:41.228]  Infowars.com And of course there's my 9-11 film that I believe is the best out there.
[01:35:41.709 --> 01:35:42.809]  And many others have said that.
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:45.361]  And it is such an important film.
[01:35:45.702 --> 01:35:46.602]  Three hours long.
[01:35:46.662 --> 01:35:51.566]  Covers the police state, 9-11, and then the neocons, Nazi connections, and much more.
[01:35:52.126 --> 01:35:53.227]  It is a tour de force.
[01:35:53.387 --> 01:35:55.169]  Really, it's three films for the price of one.
[01:35:55.509 --> 01:35:58.891]  Go to InfoWars.com and order it via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[01:35:59.292 --> 01:36:00.333]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:00.353 --> 01:36:03.875]  And you can download Martial Law for free at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:09.602 --> 01:36:20.607]  But if you want to see the high bandwidth quality, or the high download quality ones, get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership for 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, the cost of about three cups of Starbucks coffee.
[01:36:20.867 --> 01:36:25.410]  Get a monthly membership, download everything on the CD, and use that as a great activist tool.
[01:36:25.650 --> 01:36:29.992]  The power is you, the people, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, polka-dotted, Eskimo.
[01:36:31.204 --> 01:36:35.667]  Chinese, I don't care, we're all in this together, so go to InfoWars.com.
[01:36:35.727 --> 01:36:46.315]  Now, going back to Terry Anderson, before we continue with your story, sir, and then get into the reckoning, tell us about your radio show, tell us about the website, because you are the best speaker and the most informed on this subject I've seen.
[01:36:46.596 --> 01:36:47.757]  Well, you're too kind, Alex.
[01:36:48.217 --> 01:36:49.538]  I really appreciate that, too.
[01:36:49.878 --> 01:36:54.342]  Anybody who wants to know about the show can go to our website, TheTerryAndersonShow.com.
[01:36:54.362 --> 01:36:55.062]  We're on here in L.A.
[01:36:55.102 --> 01:36:55.883]  on KRLA.
[01:36:55.923 --> 01:36:56.183]  We're on
[01:36:56.855 --> 01:36:58.276]  In Phoenix on KFNX.
[01:36:58.356 --> 01:36:59.876]  We're on Vegas, KDON.
[01:37:00.117 --> 01:37:02.177]  We're all across the country on the RBN network.
[01:37:02.858 --> 01:37:04.599]  And they can hear us online.
[01:37:04.839 --> 01:37:10.201]  If they're not around one of our radio stations, they can just go to our website, the TerryAndersonShow.com, and listen there.
[01:37:10.221 --> 01:37:13.342]  We're on at 9 o'clock Pacific time, Sunday nights.
[01:37:14.223 --> 01:37:15.804]  Well, that's just fantastic, Terry.
[01:37:16.024 --> 01:37:18.605]  I wanted to finish the story real quick.
[01:37:19.445 --> 01:37:22.807]  Her name was Angelica Solis, and she was from an organization here in L.A.
[01:37:22.847 --> 01:37:23.407]  called CHIRLA.
[01:37:23.951 --> 01:37:40.975]  And at a debate with an audience that was 99% black, she made the statement that she's from Oaxaca, the state of Oaxaca, and in Oaxaca, as she grew up, they were taught to hate and treat black people as though they were animals.
[01:37:41.576 --> 01:37:42.256]  She says this.
[01:37:42.276 --> 01:37:43.637]  I have her on tape saying this.
[01:37:43.877 --> 01:37:52.799]  Something that you and I would have never said, even if it was true, at a debate of people of the opposite race who you're trying to convince that your position is correct.
[01:37:53.039 --> 01:37:54.900]  Why are they so arrogant?
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:55.680]  I don't know.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:03.582]  She actually said this, and she said, yeah, because a young man asked her, why do your young black Hispanics hate us black men so much?
[01:38:03.622 --> 01:38:06.583]  And she said, well, we're taught that from birth in Mexico.
[01:38:06.863 --> 01:38:07.903]  She actually said this.
[01:38:09.193 --> 01:38:13.655]  Well, I mean, we know that's true because it was... We know it, but I had never heard it said before.
[01:38:13.735 --> 01:38:15.075]  I mean, why would she say that?
[01:38:15.575 --> 01:38:16.796]  I thought she was pretty stupid.
[01:38:16.876 --> 01:38:20.477]  I would have never said that if I... What did the predominantly black audience do?
[01:38:21.037 --> 01:38:23.999]  Well, there was a gasp, and then the heads started shaking.
[01:38:24.039 --> 01:38:24.979]  Yeah, well, we knew it.
[01:38:25.539 --> 01:38:28.140]  Let me tell you about the black population here in L.A.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.282]  I can't speak for the rest of the country, but black folks here are fed up with the illegal immigration.
[01:38:32.322 --> 01:38:33.302]  Now, you won't know that
[01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:43.256]  From Maxine Waters and Diane Watson and the rest of these politicians and people like Earl Afari Hutchinson and Tony Mohammed, the spokesman allegedly for the black race.
[01:38:44.337 --> 01:38:44.777]  Excuse me.
[01:38:44.817 --> 01:38:50.701]  They will have you convinced that black people are in alignment with these reconquistas, but that's wrong.
[01:38:51.802 --> 01:39:00.068]  99% of these black people on the street are angry, but they just haven't got to the point where they're ready to speak up yet because they don't want to be castigated as being racist.
[01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:01.169]  Well, I...
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:17.648]  I mean, I have a lot of friends in Los Angeles, and I have some black friends and white friends, and they've told me that if you work as a chef or you work cleaning cars, you work at a hotel, that literally the Hispanics say, we've taken over, get out of here.
[01:39:17.708 --> 01:39:18.048]  Get out.
[01:39:18.248 --> 01:39:21.930]  And the management, even if they're white or black, says, look, we can't have whites in this kitchen.
[01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:23.731]  We can't have blacks in this kitchen.
[01:39:23.811 --> 01:39:25.852]  I mean, this is like Alabama in 1890 or
[01:39:28.533 --> 01:39:39.624]  Alex, you wouldn't believe the young black kids in this neighborhood have told me that they can't get hired because they're not Hispanic or they don't speak Spanish at a McDonald's or a Jack in the Box or a Burger King.
[01:39:40.025 --> 01:39:42.867]  And a lot of those owned by black people.
[01:39:43.228 --> 01:39:49.274]  And the black people will tell them, I'm sorry, I can't hire you, but we have a Spanish-speaking kitchen and we're not going to disrupt our kitchen to hire you.
[01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:50.671]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:39:50.691 --> 01:39:55.053]  They say, I mean, the main excuse is there's no communication here.
[01:39:55.073 --> 01:39:55.513]  There you go.
[01:39:56.293 --> 01:39:57.714]  That is outrageous.
[01:39:57.974 --> 01:40:00.355]  And a lot of these kids where I live, I live in the ghetto.
[01:40:00.735 --> 01:40:05.557]  A lot of these kids here are trying not to sell drugs like their big brothers do or their fathers did.
[01:40:05.777 --> 01:40:06.957]  They're trying to do right.
[01:40:07.158 --> 01:40:13.820]  They're trying to get after school jobs and summer jobs and jobs on the weekend so they can buy them some tennis shoes and some clothes.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.702]  They're trying to do the right thing and they cannot get jobs at these establishments because they're not foreigners.
[01:40:19.002 --> 01:40:20.343]  That is outrageous.
[01:40:20.583 --> 01:40:23.485]  That is outrageous that we are allowing this to happen.
[01:40:23.565 --> 01:40:24.625]  And I ask you this, Alex.
[01:40:24.986 --> 01:40:27.247]  It's not a black thing, but I have to speak from where I live.
[01:40:27.747 --> 01:40:30.809]  Where are the black leaders on this happening to these black kids?
[01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:38.394]  Where are the black leaders when a black man can't get a job in this town anymore as a bricklayer or a drywaller or a roofer or a body and fender man?
[01:40:38.674 --> 01:40:40.175]  Where are the black leaders on that?
[01:40:40.415 --> 01:40:47.479]  They are so quick to talk about what we have to achieve for the newly arrived people, and they're not saying a damn thing about their own people.
[01:40:48.459 --> 01:40:49.219]  It's outrageous.
[01:40:49.239 --> 01:40:50.760]  It is really outrageous.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.100]  And it comes back to racism.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.802]  It is a hatred for whites that makes these black leaders go in favor of the brown people.
[01:40:59.103 --> 01:41:01.363]  I mean, Terry, I'm not just saying this.
[01:41:01.423 --> 01:41:02.284]  I mean, this is the truth.
[01:41:03.024 --> 01:41:06.625]  Whites certainly did some things that were wrong.
[01:41:06.645 --> 01:41:09.226]  I mean, world history has been very corrupt.
[01:41:09.326 --> 01:41:10.767]  All cultures have done bad things.
[01:41:10.847 --> 01:41:11.947]  But whites I know...
[01:41:12.896 --> 01:41:16.538]  I mean, even so-called conservatives are these guilty people.
[01:41:16.618 --> 01:41:19.560]  They want to red carpet everybody.
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.481]  I think a lot of it's their problem.
[01:41:21.521 --> 01:41:22.162]  You can't do it.
[01:41:22.342 --> 01:41:24.363]  And I mean, listen, I'm 32 years old.
[01:41:24.483 --> 01:41:25.844]  I haven't done anything to anybody.
[01:41:26.264 --> 01:41:29.466]  And I'm sick of hearing how I'm racist and how I'm bad.
[01:41:29.486 --> 01:41:31.908]  And actually, it creates racism.
[01:41:32.288 --> 01:41:36.510]  I mean, I think 10, 15 years ago, racism was really settling down in this country.
[01:41:36.811 --> 01:41:38.532]  Now I think it's back in everybody.
[01:41:38.572 --> 01:41:40.753]  We were better off in the 60s.
[01:41:40.793 --> 01:41:41.914]  Well, late 60s and the 70s.
[01:41:42.794 --> 01:41:45.558]  In the 80s, we were a lot better off racially in this country.
[01:41:45.918 --> 01:41:50.744]  But now, oh my God, we are just absolutely going in the wrong direction.
[01:41:51.745 --> 01:41:52.787]  And let me say this to you.
[01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:55.550]  Most of the races I know now are Hispanics.
[01:41:56.011 --> 01:41:57.512]  And a lot of the races I know are black.
[01:41:57.673 --> 01:42:00.456]  Well, I have to tell you, I mean, I remember deer hunting when I was about 12.
[01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.690]  Quick.
[01:42:01.710 --> 01:42:01.810]  Quick.
[01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:02.050]  Very quick.
[01:42:25.376 --> 01:42:27.377]  They'll use that term mayate in a second.
[01:42:27.417 --> 01:42:28.698]  And they use the other terms, too.
[01:42:29.178 --> 01:42:30.519]  But they use that one in a second.
[01:42:30.979 --> 01:42:36.143]  A guy named Ted Hayes here, another gentleman I know, went down to the Mexican consulate in downtown L.A.
[01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:37.744]  the other day and protested.
[01:42:37.964 --> 01:42:40.305]  They had signs saying, you know, illegal immigration is wrong.
[01:42:40.325 --> 01:42:40.986]  These are black men.
[01:42:41.026 --> 01:42:42.046]  These are black men who did this.
[01:42:42.286 --> 01:42:42.827]  Well, guess what?
[01:42:43.147 --> 01:42:50.912]  One of the guys, James Spencer, tells me they walked from one corner where they were protesting to the Mexican embassy where they had an appointment to talk to the consul general.
[01:42:51.692 --> 01:42:53.213]  He said he's from Mississippi.
[01:42:53.863 --> 01:43:05.969]  And he said his years growing up in Mississippi in the 50s and 60s, he never experienced the racism that he did in that one block walk over there in the area where the Mexican consulate is.
[01:43:06.309 --> 01:43:13.793]  He said those were the most racist people he's ever seen with their comments, go back to Africa, talking about he had a tail, the whole bit.
[01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:16.543]  Saying he had a tail.
[01:43:16.583 --> 01:43:17.563]  Saying he had a tail.
[01:43:17.623 --> 01:43:18.244]  The whole bit.
[01:43:18.324 --> 01:43:21.465]  But at the same time, then, they call everybody else racist.
[01:43:21.805 --> 01:43:24.407]  They're the most racist people in the world that I've ever met.
[01:43:25.167 --> 01:43:26.088]  They are the worst.
[01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:41.836]  And the second part I didn't get to about buying a house in East L.A., the other one is any black man who thinks that these people are his brown brothers, try to date his sister or his aunt or his daughter and see what happens.
[01:43:42.576 --> 01:43:43.116]  What happens?
[01:43:43.316 --> 01:43:44.397]  Well, ho, please.
[01:43:45.037 --> 01:43:45.817]  There'll be a lynching.
[01:43:46.697 --> 01:43:48.098]  A new millennium style.
[01:43:49.198 --> 01:43:49.658]  Trust me.
[01:43:49.998 --> 01:43:51.499]  They don't play that.
[01:43:51.519 --> 01:43:52.959]  They do not play that one.
[01:43:53.259 --> 01:43:55.460]  There's some white folks who won't play it either.
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:00.081]  And there's some black people who don't want their kids bringing white kids home or Hispanics home.
[01:44:00.221 --> 01:44:06.483]  But I'm going to tell you, you will see more of that than you will see... You'll see Hispanic men with black women, but you won't see it the other way around.
[01:44:06.603 --> 01:44:07.023]  Not here.
[01:44:07.243 --> 01:44:07.883]  Not in this town.
[01:44:09.703 --> 01:44:12.084]  This is... Terry, I want to get into the reckoning, but...
[01:44:12.859 --> 01:44:13.139]  Yeah, they do.
[01:44:35.158 --> 01:44:39.902]  And Alex, a lot of them come from areas of the Latin world where it's nothing.
[01:44:40.142 --> 01:44:41.523]  There's violence all the time.
[01:44:41.643 --> 01:44:42.464]  No, I understand.
[01:44:42.504 --> 01:44:44.506]  So when do you think it's going to blow up?
[01:44:44.546 --> 01:44:49.810]  Glenn Spencer thinks in the next two years we're going to see giant race riots and the media is going to spin it.
[01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:52.132]  Oh, it's just predominantly the illegals doing it.
[01:44:52.412 --> 01:44:56.295]  It's going to be, oh, look at the precious illegals demanding their rights as every U.S.
[01:44:56.315 --> 01:44:57.496]  city goes down in flames.
[01:44:57.756 --> 01:45:00.218]  I have absolutely no reason to think it will take two years.
[01:45:01.324 --> 01:45:02.885]  I really don't believe it will take that long.
[01:45:03.225 --> 01:45:07.106]  And, of course, a few blacks will join in, so blacks will get blamed for it.
[01:45:07.386 --> 01:45:07.686]  Sure.
[01:45:08.366 --> 01:45:13.367]  I have video where I got in the back of my son's El Camino with a video camera.
[01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:16.628]  In 1992, we rode from neighborhood to neighborhood in video to looting.
[01:45:17.008 --> 01:45:18.789]  Ninety percent of that looting was Hispanics.
[01:45:19.329 --> 01:45:20.009]  But guess what?
[01:45:20.029 --> 01:45:21.270]  You didn't hear that down in Texas.
[01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:23.310]  What you heard was it was blacks doing it all.
[01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:24.530]  Yeah, they were out there.
[01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:25.391]  The brothers were out there.
[01:45:25.411 --> 01:45:26.211]  I'm not going to deny that.
[01:45:26.411 --> 01:45:28.171]  But 90 percent of the looting was Hispanics.
[01:45:28.892 --> 01:45:30.352]  I've got that on videotape.
[01:45:31.613 --> 01:45:32.854]  Well, I mean, it's simple.
[01:45:33.354 --> 01:45:37.898]  You don't come to somebody's house and then defecate on their dinner table at dinner.
[01:45:38.338 --> 01:45:40.680]  And I hate to use that analogy, but that's what we're dealing with.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:41.241]  Sure it is.
[01:45:41.521 --> 01:45:56.933]  And, again, I hate to even have to get up here and do this, but my Hispanic friends, they admit, multiple friends of mine admit, they'll be at a store or a restaurant, and these La Rican quiches will walk right over and go, what are you doing speaking English, gringo lover?
[01:45:57.313 --> 01:45:59.915]  You should only speak Spanish and be in the Raza.
[01:46:00.196 --> 01:46:00.616]  That's right.
[01:46:01.216 --> 01:46:02.157]  I hear it all the time.
[01:46:02.557 --> 01:46:07.780]  You know, you go in the store and the two checkout girls are speaking Spanish to each other, you know, back and forth.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:09.401]  So I always go to the manager and say, you know what?
[01:46:09.702 --> 01:46:10.762]  They were talking about me.
[01:46:11.082 --> 01:46:12.023]  They were looking at me.
[01:46:12.203 --> 01:46:12.903]  I understand Spanish.
[01:46:12.923 --> 01:46:13.524]  It's not a problem.
[01:46:13.944 --> 01:46:16.266]  But I say, you know, I don't understand Spanish, sir.
[01:46:16.446 --> 01:46:17.446]  And they were talking about me.
[01:46:17.506 --> 01:46:18.727]  I could tell they were talking about me.
[01:46:18.747 --> 01:46:20.108]  And he'll go over there and say something to them.
[01:46:20.148 --> 01:46:23.050]  I even got one of them fired one time because she did it twice.
[01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:24.150]  They weren't talking about me.
[01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:25.171]  They were just speaking Spanish.
[01:46:25.411 --> 01:46:26.552]  That is disrespectful.
[01:46:26.994 --> 01:46:28.115]  That is disrespectful.
[01:46:28.316 --> 01:46:29.097]  You're in America.
[01:46:29.337 --> 01:46:33.362]  And if you want to speak a foreign language on your break, out of the earshot of other people, fine.
[01:46:33.542 --> 01:46:35.244]  But you don't do it in front of customers.
[01:46:35.544 --> 01:46:36.446]  You do not do it.
[01:46:36.726 --> 01:46:37.807]  And that's what we've got to do.
[01:46:38.047 --> 01:46:38.808]  And we must stop.
[01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:44.075]  If we go to stores where they do this, Alex, we've got to stop going to these places and giving them our money.
[01:46:44.575 --> 01:46:52.397]  Well, you know, I've had to, I mean, frankly, I've had to do that because, you know, there's the day without gringos, don't serve the gringos.
[01:46:52.817 --> 01:46:53.798]  It's been going on in months.
[01:46:53.838 --> 01:46:54.898]  I've never experienced this.
[01:46:54.998 --> 01:46:57.639]  I'll just go, and most Mexican food restaurants are like this.
[01:46:57.699 --> 01:46:58.319]  Boy, do I love it.
[01:46:58.339 --> 01:46:59.459]  I've got a big belly to prove it.
[01:47:00.339 --> 01:47:12.823]  But, I mean, some of these places now, they actually won't serve you or you'll see, I mean, the thing I always heard about Blacks and Denny's, I'm experiencing it where 45 minutes later I've got to walk out, I haven't even gotten a glass of iced tea.
[01:47:13.163 --> 01:47:15.464]  That's right, and I would be afraid to drink the iced tea.
[01:47:16.725 --> 01:47:19.606]  When I go in restaurants and see them, I just get up and go.
[01:47:20.067 --> 01:47:22.928]  I just, you know, I don't even want to take the chance.
[01:47:22.948 --> 01:47:25.930]  You never know what they're going to do to your food, and I've heard stories of them doing it.
[01:47:26.010 --> 01:47:26.690]  So you know what?
[01:47:27.370 --> 01:47:29.972]  Anybody wants to take their chances with it, fine, but not me.
[01:47:31.212 --> 01:47:31.612]  Why?
[01:47:31.732 --> 01:47:32.153]  Why?
[01:47:32.173 --> 01:47:33.733]  I mean, what did we do?
[01:47:33.753 --> 01:47:35.274]  I just don't understand it.
[01:47:35.654 --> 01:47:36.435]  We gave too much.
[01:47:37.276 --> 01:47:38.217]  We allowed too much.
[01:47:38.397 --> 01:47:39.478]  We put up with too much.
[01:47:39.958 --> 01:47:41.180]  We surrendered too much.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.362]  And by doing that, we looked weak.
[01:47:43.642 --> 01:47:46.364]  And the weaker you look, the more advantage people will take of you.
[01:47:46.604 --> 01:47:49.727]  If we were strong people again, Alex, like we used to be, we were strong.
[01:47:49.887 --> 01:47:50.948]  This was a strong country.
[01:47:50.988 --> 01:47:52.750]  We didn't tolerate nothing from nobody.
[01:47:53.170 --> 01:48:00.537]  If we were strong again and we presented ourselves as strong people, every time we found one of these rotten people and we deported them,
[01:48:01.311 --> 01:48:04.653]  We would look strong again, and they wouldn't have this attitude that they could conquer us.
[01:48:04.893 --> 01:48:06.895]  But the more we allow, the more they're going to take.
[01:48:06.955 --> 01:48:08.196]  It's just human nature.
[01:48:09.977 --> 01:48:10.717]  It's unbelievable.
[01:48:10.737 --> 01:48:13.339]  The reckoning is coming up this weekend in Crawford.
[01:48:13.359 --> 01:48:14.120]  Tell us about it, Terry.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.482]  Yeah, a rumble at the ranch, we're calling it.
[01:48:17.582 --> 01:48:20.084]  And there's going to be quite a few great speakers there.
[01:48:20.544 --> 01:48:23.466]  It is an event to energize the American people.
[01:48:24.111 --> 01:48:26.772]  It's an event to rally the American people.
[01:48:27.492 --> 01:48:28.933]  It's never been done there in Texas.
[01:48:28.953 --> 01:48:31.754]  We want to get people used to being at these types of events.
[01:48:31.774 --> 01:48:32.554]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:48:32.654 --> 01:48:41.117]  Wild horses couldn't pull me away, but I'm on a deadline to finish a new film to present it out in Los Angeles late next month, so I cannot come.
[01:48:41.157 --> 01:48:42.497]  I'm literally up to like 2 a.m.
[01:48:42.557 --> 01:48:42.997]  every night.
[01:48:43.177 --> 01:48:44.458]  We totally understand that, Alex.
[01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:45.238]  It's not a problem.
[01:48:45.378 --> 01:48:47.039]  You don't have to make any excuses.
[01:48:47.059 --> 01:48:47.699]  You've done enough.
[01:48:47.999 --> 01:48:50.480]  You've done enough for this movement, and we appreciate it.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:49:00.526]  Well, a few months ago I went down and bullhorned the La Reconquista March, and I bullhorned Fox when he was here, but you guys are going to be there.
[01:49:00.786 --> 01:49:02.127]  Tell folks at what time it's going to be.
[01:49:02.487 --> 01:49:09.251]  It's going to be at 1 o'clock, and I don't have the information in front of me, but they can go to the website areckoning.com.
[01:49:09.672 --> 01:49:11.253]  And you guys are meeting in downtown Crawford.
[01:49:11.273 --> 01:49:11.933]  You can't miss it.
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.101]  Yeah, areckoning.com.
[01:49:14.201 --> 01:49:17.483]  It's parking out of a stadium there we're going to be in.
[01:49:17.743 --> 01:49:18.904]  How long are you going to be in Texas?
[01:49:18.924 --> 01:49:24.027]  Because I'd love to have you in studio Monday or something so I can videotape it and put it on the TV show.
[01:49:24.368 --> 01:49:25.208]  No, I'm coming home.
[01:49:25.288 --> 01:49:28.190]  I'm leaving here Friday evening and I'm coming home Saturday night.
[01:49:28.650 --> 01:49:31.012]  Wow, and so what day is the Reckoning?
[01:49:31.572 --> 01:49:32.633]  Saturday at 1 p.m.
[01:49:32.813 --> 01:49:35.354]  My gosh, you're going to do the Reckoning and you'll jump right back on an airplane.
[01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:36.115]  Yeah, I have to.
[01:49:36.135 --> 01:49:37.276]  Because you've got the radio show.
[01:49:37.496 --> 01:49:37.596]  Yep.
[01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:39.892]  Boy, I tell you, Terry, stay there.
[01:49:39.952 --> 01:49:40.874]  Final segment with you.
[01:49:40.894 --> 01:49:43.939]  We've got Luba Moreno coming on with us as well.
[01:49:44.961 --> 01:49:46.844]  And there are a lot of people mad.
[01:49:46.964 --> 01:49:47.986]  Al Garza's mad.
[01:49:48.006 --> 01:49:50.530]  Al Ramirez is mad.
[01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:51.452]  People are getting mad.
[01:49:51.692 --> 01:49:52.293]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.115 --> 01:49:54.617]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.797 --> 01:49:57.901]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.021 --> 01:50:01.926]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:01.986 --> 01:50:06.211]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:10.316]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.456 --> 01:50:12.278]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.538 --> 01:50:15.759]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:50:15.799 --> 01:50:20.521]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.661 --> 01:50:23.702]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:23.902 --> 01:50:26.803]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.244 --> 01:50:33.346]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:33.886 --> 01:50:34.606]  We're good to go.
[01:50:34.626 --> 01:50:35.107]  We're good to go.
[01:50:52.433 --> 01:51:00.677]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:00.937 --> 01:51:05.298]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:05.599 --> 01:51:14.502]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:14.702 --> 01:51:18.344]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:18.624 --> 01:51:23.646]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:23.946 --> 01:51:30.689]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:51:31.150 --> 01:51:31.710]  What about you?
[01:51:32.298 --> 01:51:32.838]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:51:32.858 --> 01:51:34.399]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:59.608]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:59.848 --> 01:52:02.109]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.289 --> 01:52:08.651]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:08.991 --> 01:52:09.631]  We're good to go.
[01:52:09.651 --> 01:52:10.172]  We're good to go.
[01:52:38.507 --> 01:52:38.867]  Terry Anderson.
[01:52:58.656 --> 01:53:09.761]  If 5 million of the 25 million were to riot and burn things, it would make the riots of the 60s look like child's play, and then the government will say, oh, see, we've got to legalize them, got to give them what they want.
[01:53:09.961 --> 01:53:18.684]  We look just like ancient Rome when the Romans brought in the Germans and the French, the Gauls, who then decided to go ahead and take over, too.
[01:53:19.165 --> 01:53:21.045]  Yeah, and that was successful, and guess what?
[01:53:21.385 --> 01:53:24.347]  If we do this, they will have successfully conquered us.
[01:53:24.447 --> 01:53:25.087]  I mean, you know what?
[01:53:25.856 --> 01:53:30.859]  How could you possibly think in terms of legalizing somebody who's blackmailing you?
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:32.560]  What do you think?
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:33.581]  They're blackmailing.
[01:53:33.701 --> 01:53:34.921]  Now they're threatening us with violence.
[01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:42.926]  I don't know if you guys heard, but here in L.A., they were threatening to park their trucks on a freeway, to send their children walking on the freeways, which they did already once.
[01:53:43.526 --> 01:53:46.408]  They threatened to block the port, to block the airport.
[01:53:46.608 --> 01:53:49.090]  They were going to block everything with their diesel trucks.
[01:53:50.170 --> 01:53:51.111]  I mean, that's blackmail.
[01:53:52.122 --> 01:53:53.404]  That's total blackmail.
[01:53:53.424 --> 01:53:54.004]  That's all it is.
[01:53:54.285 --> 01:53:57.629]  What do you think of Bush and Fox hiring a PR firm in December?
[01:53:57.669 --> 01:54:00.732]  Dallas Morning News admits this whole thing was staged by Bush.
[01:54:01.753 --> 01:54:03.776]  Oh, I believe anything you would tell me about him.
[01:54:05.138 --> 01:54:06.499]  I've never liked him.
[01:54:06.579 --> 01:54:07.200]  I never will.
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:16.127]  And I am so disgusted with these Republicans who still tell me that he's a good man.
[01:54:16.387 --> 01:54:18.088]  That he's a good, honest American man.
[01:54:18.128 --> 01:54:18.669]  He is not.
[01:54:18.989 --> 01:54:20.350]  He is everything but that.
[01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:23.452]  This man has sold out this country in about a dozen different ways.
[01:54:23.713 --> 01:54:26.655]  But on this issue, he's the Antichrist.
[01:54:27.734 --> 01:54:29.055]  Terry, let's take a call.
[01:54:29.375 --> 01:54:31.896]  Let's talk to Osa in Texas.
[01:54:31.956 --> 01:54:33.517]  Osa, you're on the air with Terry Anderson.
[01:54:34.237 --> 01:54:35.397]  Hi, yeah, this is Osa.
[01:54:35.497 --> 01:54:37.478]  I had a couple of quick things to say.
[01:54:37.919 --> 01:54:54.526]  I mean, I wish someone would just sit the radical Hispanics down and just talk to them and let them know and tell them that the same group who funds the rest of these racial hate groups like the KKK and many others are the same groups, in effect, that fund the Hispanic groups.
[01:54:54.906 --> 01:54:57.087]  And if someone just sat them down just for a minute
[01:54:57.987 --> 01:54:59.648]  And just talked to them and told them these things.
[01:55:00.068 --> 01:55:02.069]  I bet you there would be a change probably by tomorrow.
[01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:04.409]  I would disagree with you, caller.
[01:55:04.810 --> 01:55:06.930]  Also, I understand where you're coming from.
[01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:07.591]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:55:07.711 --> 01:55:08.591]  I think it's a good idea.
[01:55:08.951 --> 01:55:10.152]  I don't think it would change anything.
[01:55:10.492 --> 01:55:16.134]  I think their hatred for America and their hatred for anybody who's non-Hispanic goes so deep it wouldn't do any good.
[01:55:16.630 --> 01:55:18.172]  I really don't think it would change anything.
[01:55:18.272 --> 01:55:19.193]  I would be willing to do it.
[01:55:19.273 --> 01:55:19.853]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:55:19.873 --> 01:55:20.394]  Well, let's boil it down.
[01:55:20.414 --> 01:55:21.675]  I don't think it would change anything.
[01:55:21.855 --> 01:55:22.616]  Let's boil it down.
[01:55:22.676 --> 01:55:28.782]  You have a very primitive third world population, and racism is a primitive thing.
[01:55:28.842 --> 01:55:41.353]  I call it tribalism, and it's just we're this domesticated, modern, lapdog society here, and we're colliding with an ancient culture that likes its culture, and that's its identity, and it's
[01:55:42.194 --> 01:55:43.155]  It's a pride thing.
[01:55:43.175 --> 01:55:47.317]  They don't care if they're being conned, some of them, by the globalists being used.
[01:55:47.617 --> 01:55:50.658]  As long as they're used, they're happy to be, Terry.
[01:55:51.399 --> 01:55:58.982]  Well, I think so, and I also think, going back to the caller's point, I understand what he's saying.
[01:55:59.883 --> 01:56:04.465]  I think that these people have an agenda, and they don't care who funds them.
[01:56:05.026 --> 01:56:11.396]  I think they will take money from the devil if they think it's going to make them be in a position to conquer this country.
[01:56:11.416 --> 01:56:12.698]  That's all that matters to them.
[01:56:12.778 --> 01:56:13.700]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:56:14.581 --> 01:56:15.142]  It's important.
[01:56:16.053 --> 01:56:21.874]  There is nobody harder working, friendlier, more patriotic than Hispanic Americans that I know.
[01:56:21.894 --> 01:56:24.114]  I mean, some of my best friends are.
[01:56:24.214 --> 01:56:26.275]  I mean, and that's the old cliche, but I mean, that's true, folks.
[01:56:26.355 --> 01:56:26.795]  Oh, me too.
[01:56:27.095 --> 01:56:35.396]  And so you've got these wonderful American folks, like Juan Navarro, who helped found Texas, and it was nationally a morning when he died, blah, blah, blah.
[01:56:36.117 --> 01:56:42.438]  But at the same time, then you get this group from southern and central Mexico, and they like the Aztec culture, man.
[01:56:42.698 --> 01:56:43.898]  I mean, they're into evil stuff.
[01:56:44.138 --> 01:56:44.518]  Cannibals.
[01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:46.651]  People have played with heads.
[01:56:46.731 --> 01:56:49.875]  I mean, these are some vicious, vile people.
[01:56:50.135 --> 01:56:56.562]  And if they're praising that culture and saying that they came from a culture of warriors and they want to be Aztecs, give me a break.
[01:56:57.022 --> 01:56:59.225]  I mean, I could pick a little better culture than that.
[01:56:59.525 --> 01:57:03.029]  Well, I don't go back and pick some weird German tribe that ate their children.
[01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.769]  There you go.
[01:57:03.849 --> 01:57:06.112]  I don't say... I have a good one, too, Alex.
[01:57:06.512 --> 01:57:06.692]  Huh?
[01:57:06.712 --> 01:57:06.933]  You know?
[01:57:08.502 --> 01:57:10.624]  I'm sure there was one back in history at one time.
[01:57:10.704 --> 01:57:11.264]  Oh, there were.
[01:57:11.304 --> 01:57:12.145]  There were lots of them.
[01:57:12.185 --> 01:57:12.966]  There were lots of them.
[01:57:12.986 --> 01:57:13.306]  Yeah.
[01:57:13.486 --> 01:57:16.989]  You can go pick some African tribe, Terry, to model yourself.
[01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:18.910]  Terry Anderson, will you do five more minutes with us?
[01:57:19.150 --> 01:57:19.391]  Sure.
[01:57:19.871 --> 01:57:22.793]  I want to do a few more minutes, then we're going to get Lupe Moreno on with us.
[01:57:23.454 --> 01:57:24.895]  And anything else, Elsa?
[01:57:25.756 --> 01:57:25.976]  Yes.
[01:57:26.036 --> 01:57:26.596]  Well, stay there.
[01:57:26.636 --> 01:57:27.657]  I'll let you finish up when we get back.
[01:57:27.977 --> 01:57:30.699]  We'll start the third hour in 70 seconds.
[01:57:33.428 --> 01:57:37.649]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.689 --> 01:57:38.109]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.269 --> 01:57:38.889]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.049 --> 01:57:42.450]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:46.531]  You want answers?
[01:57:46.571 --> 01:57:48.451]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.541 --> 01:58:01.164]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.724 --> 01:58:05.847]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.707 --> 01:58:08.729]  Lupi Marino is joining us.
[01:58:09.289 --> 01:58:14.573]  Latino Americans, and they're very upset about the La Reconquista movement.
[01:58:15.313 --> 01:58:25.400]  We're talking to Terry Anderson, taking a few more calls here before he leaves as national talk show host and immigration activist against the takeover that's happening funded by our own government, Mexico's government.
[01:58:26.568 --> 01:58:37.295]  Terry, it's also, and I've talked to my Hispanic friends, it's painful for them, because before this whole Reconquista fired up in the last ten years, they didn't have any tension with whites and blacks, but now it's creating tension.
[01:58:37.315 --> 01:58:40.376]  They're some of the most angry people I've found out there about this.
[01:58:40.757 --> 01:58:41.617]  They hate everybody.
[01:58:42.258 --> 01:58:47.801]  They hate everybody that's not like them, and that includes people like one of the greatest Americans I've ever known, Lupe Moreno, who...
[01:58:48.297 --> 01:58:52.998]  Who is an American who happens to be Hispanic, who has Mexican roots, who speaks the language.
[01:58:53.278 --> 01:58:53.759]  You know what?
[01:58:53.939 --> 01:58:56.519]  They hate her because she's not in alignment with them.
[01:58:56.579 --> 01:58:57.740]  They hate everybody.
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:00.200]  And yes, it has made tension with black folks here.
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:01.301]  And it's going to get worse.
[01:59:01.361 --> 01:59:07.222]  Whenever you start taking what people have away, like their jobs, their schools, their communities, yeah, it's going to create problems.
[01:59:07.522 --> 01:59:09.563]  We never had a huge piece of the pie here, Alex.
[01:59:09.603 --> 01:59:10.483]  We had a little slice.
[01:59:10.823 --> 01:59:15.665]  And we tried to increase that over the years through affirmative action and all the other stuff that's outdated now.
[01:59:16.005 --> 01:59:16.725]  But let me say this.
[01:59:17.205 --> 01:59:22.386]  Since the illegals got here, they took that little sliver of pie we had, they cut it in three pieces, and they took two.
[01:59:22.887 --> 01:59:25.747]  Now, how do we just sit back and not say anything about that?
[01:59:26.247 --> 01:59:27.548]  Oh, so finish up what you were saying.
[01:59:27.588 --> 01:59:28.768]  I'm going to move on.
[01:59:28.788 --> 01:59:30.249]  Okay, I'll just be real quick about it.
[01:59:30.329 --> 01:59:37.411]  I mean, it's such a shame that we've allowed ourselves to become, you know, susceptible to a lot of these distractions that are going on out there.
[01:59:37.731 --> 01:59:42.732]  Now, the immigration problem, and it is a problem because it could potentially damage our sovereignty,
[01:59:43.226 --> 01:59:49.770]  I mean, there are many other things that are going on, like the war in Iraq, the casualties, the murders, and everything else.
[01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:51.331]  I mean, it's just so sad.
[01:59:51.391 --> 01:59:53.273]  Yes, sir, and we cover that.
[01:59:53.293 --> 01:59:59.777]  But let me tell you, this globalism, this breaking down our borders, is one of the jewels in the crown of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.797 --> 02:00:02.139]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:02.419 --> 02:00:03.079]  And it's working.
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:04.900]  It is working.
[02:00:07.062 --> 02:00:09.343]  Okay, let's talk to Skio in Pennsylvania.
[02:00:09.383 --> 02:00:10.104]  Go ahead, Skio.
[02:00:10.879 --> 02:00:11.880]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:12.800]  Doing a talk show.
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:13.380]  What's on your mind?
[02:00:13.921 --> 02:00:16.562]  Hey, real quick here.
[02:00:17.202 --> 02:00:19.704]  And I'll tie this all in together in a second.
[02:00:19.964 --> 02:00:20.424]  Hey, go ahead.
[02:00:20.664 --> 02:00:27.668]  But I went to Domestic Relations to try to get my petition to get it remodified.
[02:00:28.688 --> 02:00:29.769]  So they sent me back a letter.
[02:00:30.729 --> 02:00:34.991]  And it tells me in this letter that I have to bring a W-2 form and blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:35.952 --> 02:00:39.754]  And on the next page, it tells me if I fail to bring this...
[02:00:40.427 --> 02:00:41.608]  Now listen, they're super-citizens.
[02:01:10.746 --> 02:01:12.246]  They have more rights than anybody.
[02:01:12.426 --> 02:01:14.047]  But this caller is right on the money.
[02:01:14.327 --> 02:01:18.067]  They're going to place him to a higher standard when it comes to proving who he is.
[02:01:18.347 --> 02:01:22.588]  A guy born here, a guy who's been here his whole life, parents from here, grandparents from here, but guess what?
[02:01:22.788 --> 02:01:24.448]  He's got to prove who he is.
[02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.929]  Others don't.
[02:01:26.869 --> 02:01:29.569]  And another thing, Alex, you guys hit it right on the barrel head.
[02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:31.410]  This is a crown jewel.
[02:01:31.810 --> 02:01:33.270]  This is exactly what they want.
[02:01:34.330 --> 02:01:34.630]  Okay?
[02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:36.131]  Is to tear down them borders.
[02:01:36.931 --> 02:01:38.631]  Canada and Mexico.
[02:01:39.651 --> 02:01:43.393]  And Alex, I've talked to you before in the past about the New World Order, when's it coming?
[02:01:43.553 --> 02:01:43.933]  It's here.
[02:01:44.993 --> 02:01:46.174]  Let's just face it, it's here.
[02:01:46.954 --> 02:01:52.076]  Now it's time for all the Americans to gather together and say, enough.
[02:01:52.737 --> 02:01:53.277]  It's time.
[02:01:54.197 --> 02:01:55.658]  If we don't stand up today...
[02:01:56.317 --> 02:01:57.758]  We won't be able to stand up tomorrow.
[02:01:58.138 --> 02:01:58.579]  I hear you.
[02:01:58.659 --> 02:02:00.600]  I appreciate the call, sir.
[02:02:01.541 --> 02:02:03.262]  Terry Anderson, thank you for joining us.
[02:02:03.282 --> 02:02:03.562]  My pleasure.
[02:02:03.582 --> 02:02:07.345]  And you're going to be out there at the Reckoning Saturday, 1 o'clock, downtown Crawford.
[02:02:07.365 --> 02:02:08.446]  And you're going out to the ranch.
[02:02:09.046 --> 02:02:12.268]  And we're going to have some folks out there with some cameras to cover it.
[02:02:12.529 --> 02:02:12.849]  Great.
[02:02:12.989 --> 02:02:16.071]  And I really look forward to someday in the future having a chance to meet you in person.
[02:02:16.311 --> 02:02:16.892]  We will, buddy.
[02:02:16.912 --> 02:02:17.552]  We'll get together.
[02:02:17.792 --> 02:02:18.453]  Take care, Terry.
[02:02:18.573 --> 02:02:19.113]  Thanks for having me.
[02:02:19.294 --> 02:02:19.554]  You bet.
[02:02:19.574 --> 02:02:19.874]  Bye-bye.
[02:02:20.294 --> 02:02:20.714]  All right.
[02:02:21.194 --> 02:02:23.295]  We've got Libby Marino coming on with us.
[02:02:23.415 --> 02:02:25.276]  We'll talk for about 30-40 minutes as well.
[02:02:25.736 --> 02:02:27.337]  We'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:02:27.357 --> 02:02:31.418]  1-800-259-9231 on this subject.
[02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:34.259]  And we'll go to your calls coming up in the next segment.
[02:02:35.079 --> 02:02:39.281]  And we'll get into a whole host of other issues in the last 15 minutes of the show after Libby leaves us.
[02:02:39.781 --> 02:02:40.581]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:40.661 --> 02:02:42.522]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:02:46.556 --> 02:02:49.419]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.679 --> 02:02:50.380]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:51.241]  Alex Jones here.

[02:03:03.673 --> 02:03:05.653]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.854 --> 02:03:08.694]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.794 --> 02:03:13.455]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.655 --> 02:03:18.056]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.296 --> 02:03:25.538]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.758 --> 02:03:28.199]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:04:45.769 --> 02:04:49.352]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:04:49.592 --> 02:04:50.473]  Look no further.
[02:04:50.773 --> 02:04:53.335]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.

[02:05:02.421 --> 02:05:02.861]  We're good to go.
[02:05:20.034 --> 02:05:20.715]  We're good to go.
[02:05:45.605 --> 02:05:47.828]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.388 --> 02:05:51.171]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:12.854 --> 02:06:16.578]  Alright, now 8 minutes, 30 seconds into this third and final hour.
[02:06:17.339 --> 02:06:23.785]  Libby Moreno has the website latinoamericans.org and their organization is Pro-America.
[02:06:24.907 --> 02:06:26.768]  Why would you not want to be pro-U.S.?
[02:06:26.828 --> 02:06:29.251]  I mean, more freedoms, more liberties than Mexico.
[02:06:30.712 --> 02:06:35.998]  And she has been demonstrating and protesting and speaking out for a long time about the invasion of this country.
[02:06:36.934 --> 02:06:39.075]  And people that are wrapping themselves in foreign flags.
[02:06:39.935 --> 02:06:42.016]  Lupe, thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[02:06:42.396 --> 02:06:43.616]  Well, thank you for having me on.
[02:06:43.876 --> 02:06:44.156]  You bet.
[02:06:44.176 --> 02:06:48.117]  Tell us about your organization and what you're up to right now.
[02:06:48.898 --> 02:06:53.379]  Well, our organization started about 14 years ago.
[02:06:54.559 --> 02:07:02.462]  My sister's child was murdered by an illegal alien, and they were inviting her to Washington to...
[02:07:03.024 --> 02:07:16.850]  Give testimony before Congress and she was doing a lot of speaking engagements and I started helping her and we just didn't have a name for our group and since there was so many Latinos involved with the organization, we decided to call it that.
[02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:23.893]  And we've been doing, what is it, lobbying Congress and Sacramento ever since.
[02:07:25.018 --> 02:07:26.460]  And it's Latino Americans.
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:29.403]  Latino Americans for Immigration Reform.
[02:07:29.623 --> 02:07:29.944]  Yes.
[02:07:30.344 --> 02:07:42.878]  Now, I don't like hyphenated words, except it seemed to get the interest of the population and the media at a time when nobody was paying attention to this issue.
[02:07:44.051 --> 02:07:48.434]  Lupe, you're in a good position to explain something to me because I don't like talking about this.
[02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:49.775]  I like to bring people together.
[02:07:50.395 --> 02:07:55.379]  I'm somebody who's gone out over 10 times and protested the Ku Klux Klan going back 12 years.
[02:07:56.039 --> 02:07:57.400]  We put video of it on the site.
[02:07:58.081 --> 02:07:59.401]  I don't like racist groups.
[02:08:00.962 --> 02:08:02.323]  I wouldn't call myself a liberal.
[02:08:02.383 --> 02:08:03.763]  I mean, I'm a constitutionalist.
[02:08:04.383 --> 02:08:09.945]  And over the last six, seven, eight years, I've had to talk about Mecha, La Raza, all the racism.
[02:08:10.705 --> 02:08:12.766]  They don't even like Hispanics that love America.
[02:08:12.806 --> 02:08:17.827]  They come up to my Hispanic friends and tell them, hey, you should only speak Spanish when they hear Hispanics speaking English.
[02:08:19.088 --> 02:08:24.870]  Why is there this dichotomy between Hispanic Americans and then a large group of these illegal aliens?
[02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:29.251]  Why are they just so rabidly anti-America from your experience?
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:31.841]  Well, let me tell you.
[02:08:33.022 --> 02:08:37.325]  The groups that you're mentioning started in the late 60s, early 70s.
[02:08:37.945 --> 02:08:52.015]  And when they brought it to the population here in California, they actually came as saying that they wanted to, what is it, empower the Chicanos.
[02:08:52.055 --> 02:08:53.056]  We were called Chicanos.
[02:08:53.076 --> 02:08:57.519]  And the reason we were called Chicanos was to say we were not Mexicans.
[02:08:58.075 --> 02:09:00.736]  Because the Mexicans actually did not like us.
[02:09:00.836 --> 02:09:03.696]  The Mexicans called us half-breeds or borchers.
[02:09:04.356 --> 02:09:15.319]  And so the kids that walked out of the school and actually formed these groups actually thought they were fighting for their rights as Americans.
[02:09:15.539 --> 02:09:17.019]  That's what they walked out for.
[02:09:17.039 --> 02:09:18.699]  That's what they thought they were doing.
[02:09:19.219 --> 02:09:26.621]  Never realizing that these groups were actually formed by people that were either hardcore socialists or communists.
[02:09:27.242 --> 02:09:36.865]  Now, a lot of the kids went on to finish high school and went on to college and forgot all about the Mecha Movement and everything like that.
[02:09:37.285 --> 02:09:44.467]  But a hardcore group of them stayed together and they became what I call our politicians today.
[02:09:44.627 --> 02:09:52.650]  And it's very scary because there is so many politicians here in California that belong to these groups
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:54.821]  That it's just mind-boggling.
[02:09:54.841 --> 02:10:06.248]  The Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, the Mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Larrigoza, the Lieutenant Governor of California.
[02:10:06.728 --> 02:10:11.771]  We have congressmen from the state of California that belong to this group.
[02:10:11.831 --> 02:10:21.197]  We have... I haven't seen a senator yet, but I did go to Barbara Boxer's office one time
[02:10:21.821 --> 02:10:25.782]  And the first thing, you see, they have code words for us.
[02:10:26.183 --> 02:10:31.584]  And the code word either has to do with gente, raza, the people.
[02:10:31.724 --> 02:10:37.346]  When they throw those code words at you, they're seeing where you stand on the issue as a Latino.
[02:10:37.986 --> 02:10:51.271]  And I was, I mean, it totally terrorized me when I went to Washington, D.C., and this young man that was a top aide of Barbara Boxer, who was one of our senators,
[02:10:51.906 --> 02:10:56.050]  Yeah, saying, are you with the Raza?
[02:10:56.551 --> 02:10:58.293]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:10:58.453 --> 02:11:02.497]  I mean, it's just totally chilling how far this thing has gone.
[02:11:02.797 --> 02:11:06.902]  And most people don't, most Americans don't even realize
[02:11:07.502 --> 02:11:09.183]  Well, see, it's perfect for a takeover.
[02:11:09.223 --> 02:11:14.745]  That's why enemy armies use codes so the other army can't hear when you're using a foreign language.
[02:11:15.285 --> 02:11:19.167]  The local radio stations in Austin are called the Invader, the Bandit.
[02:11:19.547 --> 02:11:22.228]  It's all over the cars, the Mexican flags everywhere.
[02:11:23.468 --> 02:11:29.731]  And then my wife lived almost five, six years in Spain, so she speaks fluent Spanish.
[02:11:30.211 --> 02:11:30.652]  We're good to go.
[02:11:49.850 --> 02:11:50.290]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:50.931 --> 02:11:51.731]  It's totally true.
[02:11:51.932 --> 02:12:07.143]  And so I don't understand why... But that's a key point you brought up, is that Mexico is such a classist society that the government itself doesn't like Hispanics who are mainly Indian or Aboriginal descent.
[02:12:07.683 --> 02:12:10.766]  And then here in America, there's racism towards blacks.
[02:12:11.326 --> 02:12:12.847]  All of this, I mean... Oh, yes.
[02:12:13.067 --> 02:12:14.488]  Why are these people like this?
[02:12:15.329 --> 02:12:16.930]  I'll tell you the truth.
[02:12:17.150 --> 02:12:18.471]  I don't know...
[02:12:20.988 --> 02:12:37.552]  Because my father was a Mexican, I was surrounded by cousins and uncles that would actually make fun of us because we were American-born, and they didn't consider us real Mexicans, which, thank God, my father, who was an immigrant, said, you know what?
[02:12:37.992 --> 02:12:39.513]  You were born in the United States.
[02:12:39.673 --> 02:12:40.613]  You are Americans.
[02:12:40.833 --> 02:12:45.614]  Men and women have died to give you the right to say you're an American.
[02:12:45.694 --> 02:12:47.675]  I better not hear you say anything else.
[02:12:47.955 --> 02:12:49.175]  Thank God for my father, but
[02:12:50.426 --> 02:12:53.228]  That's the way my uncles and my cousins acted.
[02:12:53.748 --> 02:12:59.533]  And there's this whole mentality that for some reason they think they're better than everybody else.
[02:12:59.633 --> 02:13:06.999]  And yes, they use very nasty names on white people and on black people and people that they don't like.
[02:13:07.039 --> 02:13:17.328]  Well, even on people like me, I'm called a coconut, an Aryan collaborator, a traitor to my race, a traitor to them.
[02:13:17.799 --> 02:13:27.903]  And, you know, in the beginning it was very scary because I actually dropped out of school very early, and when those groups were starting, I never got involved with them.
[02:13:28.063 --> 02:13:30.184]  I was actually called a geek.
[02:13:30.244 --> 02:13:31.764]  My sister called me a geek, a reader.
[02:13:32.184 --> 02:13:33.765]  So I didn't pay attention.
[02:13:33.825 --> 02:13:41.028]  So when I grew up and I started going out into the world and finding these people, and right away they start using the code words on you.
[02:13:41.108 --> 02:13:44.849]  Now, it gets scary, I'll tell you, because I've been doing this for so long.
[02:13:44.889 --> 02:13:46.470]  A lot of people do recognize me.
[02:13:46.969 --> 02:13:50.610]  I come on Spanish TV a lot.
[02:13:50.630 --> 02:13:54.192]  I've been the voice of the American people.
[02:13:54.852 --> 02:13:59.793]  American TV doesn't pay attention to me and American media doesn't pay attention to me.
[02:14:00.114 --> 02:14:02.194]  But the Spanish media knows who I am.
[02:14:02.674 --> 02:14:08.877]  So I went into my doctor's office one day and there was this woman.
[02:14:09.037 --> 02:14:10.117]  Right away she came out.
[02:14:10.197 --> 02:14:13.258]  Right away I knew that she knew who I was.
[02:14:14.078 --> 02:14:15.659]  And she was livid.
[02:14:16.201 --> 02:14:19.002]  And this woman was going to put eye drops in my eye.
[02:14:19.542 --> 02:14:28.404]  And I sat there for an hour in that seat terrified because I knew that she was a La Raza person.
[02:14:29.125 --> 02:14:32.365]  And I just kept thinking, Lord, please, Alexis, let her do her job.
[02:14:32.445 --> 02:14:33.446]  Let her do her job.
[02:14:34.066 --> 02:14:36.106]  And thank goodness she did.
[02:14:36.307 --> 02:14:37.687]  I never went back there.
[02:14:37.847 --> 02:14:40.108]  I'm very careful where I go to the doctor now.
[02:14:40.808 --> 02:14:42.768]  But I had the same problem with the dentist.
[02:14:42.888 --> 02:14:45.329]  I walked into the dentist's office and the girl recognized me.
[02:14:45.754 --> 02:14:51.179]  Now she wasn't one of them, but I thought, you know what, who knows who in this office is.
[02:14:51.639 --> 02:15:06.611]  So I've actually, I started going to Vietnamese doctors, because at least Vietnamese doctors don't know who I am, and I won't be hurt, but it's a movement that is in everything.
[02:15:06.751 --> 02:15:13.297]  It's in the schools, it's like I said, it's in the medical profession, it is everywhere, and
[02:15:13.993 --> 02:15:16.075]  You just have to listen for the key words.
[02:15:16.315 --> 02:15:17.536]  Well, this stuff is dangerous.
[02:15:17.616 --> 02:15:22.219]  I mean, look what Hitler did with this type of tribalist, primitive, racial stuff.
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:23.320]  Absolutely.
[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:24.281]  Absolutely.
[02:15:24.461 --> 02:15:26.643]  And that's who they remind me of.
[02:15:26.683 --> 02:15:31.967]  But they're the first ones that will call Americans racist.
[02:15:32.167 --> 02:15:35.729]  I mean, and when you think about it, they're the racist.
[02:15:35.809 --> 02:15:38.471]  They're the ones that bring up all this stuff.
[02:15:38.912 --> 02:15:41.594]  And the white America, and even all of them, even me,
[02:15:42.785 --> 02:15:45.792]  I was taken back the first time I was called a racist.
[02:15:45.892 --> 02:15:52.306]  I'm thinking, well, you know, I even looked up the word just to make sure what in the world they were talking about.
[02:15:52.779 --> 02:15:56.921]  And I'd seen what it meant, and I thought, well, no, this can't be me.
[02:15:56.981 --> 02:16:01.923]  Well, now, the illegal aliens have a disproportionate for their population amount of crimes they commit.
[02:16:02.243 --> 02:16:05.425]  You talked about your sister's, one of her children, being killed by an illegal alien.
[02:16:05.925 --> 02:16:15.330]  I mean, I'm sure you brought this up to the Lurican Keys, just, hey, I'm involved, you know, you guys are doing whatever you want, you've killed members of my family, and, I mean, do they just make jokes about that, too?
[02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:17.210]  Well, they don't care.
[02:16:17.230 --> 02:16:19.952]  It just seems like they don't care.
[02:16:19.972 --> 02:16:20.252]  They're
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:42.649]  Now, one thing is that what the, I can't say that word, the Mesa people, what the Mesa people started realizing in the, I think in the late 70s and 80s, is that most American Latinos are American.
[02:16:43.149 --> 02:16:47.491]  And they didn't, you know, listen to what they were saying.
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:54.502]  So basically they went after the immigrant population because the immigrant population is so easy to manipulate.
[02:16:55.082 --> 02:16:57.803]  No, I've had Hispanic friends tell me, Alex, you're right.
[02:16:57.983 --> 02:17:02.724]  I've been having illegals walk up to me again and say, you don't use English.
[02:17:02.784 --> 02:17:03.444]  Do you hear us?
[02:17:03.484 --> 02:17:04.785]  You joined the Raza.
[02:17:05.005 --> 02:17:06.045]  You're in the Raza.
[02:17:06.745 --> 02:17:08.326]  They say they're aggressive about it.
[02:17:08.546 --> 02:17:09.866]  They're very aggressive.
[02:17:10.006 --> 02:17:13.367]  And, you know, we have let them do that to us.
[02:17:14.297 --> 02:17:18.458]  Because Americans were so afraid of being called racist.
[02:17:18.998 --> 02:17:21.819]  They kept quiet, especially here in California.
[02:17:21.859 --> 02:17:31.401]  I mean, you know, here in California we have all that hippie generation, and so all they want to do is kumbaya, and so when people tell them stuff, they kept quiet.
[02:17:31.501 --> 02:17:35.942]  Everybody kept quiet, kept quiet, and these people have gotten to be... Lupe, we've got a break.
[02:17:35.962 --> 02:17:37.223]  We're going to break here in just a second.
[02:17:37.263 --> 02:17:37.763]  Stay with us.
[02:17:38.567 --> 02:17:38.767]  Okay.
[02:17:39.128 --> 02:17:42.231]  And we'll come back and tell folks about your organization, the website, and a lot more.
[02:17:42.251 --> 02:17:43.372]  We're so honored to be joined by you.
[02:17:43.652 --> 02:17:44.373]  And we'll take calls.
[02:17:45.606 --> 02:17:48.488]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:17:48.828 --> 02:17:51.710]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:58.134]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:17:58.514 --> 02:18:05.819]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:18:05.999 --> 02:18:10.082]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:18:10.362 --> 02:18:15.883]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[02:18:16.103 --> 02:18:29.205]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[02:18:48.432 --> 02:18:51.693]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:18:52.433 --> 02:18:56.415]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:02.679 --> 02:19:05.820]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:10.981]  The bank paid you 1%, your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:11.521 --> 02:19:13.742]  Here is reality.
[02:19:14.122 --> 02:19:17.703]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:18.203 --> 02:19:21.844]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:22.404 --> 02:19:24.925]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:26.593 --> 02:19:27.453]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:27.553 --> 02:19:32.476]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[02:19:32.496 --> 02:19:34.657]  It discussed the United States military under U.N.
[02:19:34.717 --> 02:19:34.997]  command.
[02:19:56.684 --> 02:19:58.125]  Would the Marines accept this?
[02:19:58.346 --> 02:20:09.055]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[02:20:09.575 --> 02:20:10.996]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:20:11.016 --> 02:20:12.918]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[02:20:13.458 --> 02:20:20.965]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:43.461 --> 02:20:46.583]  If you had to flee your home in three minutes, what would you bring?
[02:20:47.563 --> 02:20:54.288]  Wouldn't it be nice if you had all of your important items in one place and ready to grab just in case you had to leave quickly in an emergency?
[02:20:57.603 --> 02:21:02.847]  Guardian Angel Preparedness specializes in survival products and 72-hour survival kits.
[02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:09.553]  Our kits contain only the finest quality survival supplies, hand-selected to be of real value in an emergency.
[02:21:09.953 --> 02:21:12.896]  We have kits for one, two, four people or more.
[02:21:13.356 --> 02:21:20.442]  We also carry emergency lighting, tools, and even survival supplies for your dog, like saddlebags and collapsible food and water bowls.
[02:21:20.802 --> 02:21:21.482]  We're good to go.
[02:21:51.616 --> 02:21:56.720]  In a bloody war for liberty for their descendants.
[02:22:12.902 --> 02:22:17.526]  Imagine the founding fathers witnessing tens of millions of foreigners running around saying this is Mexico.
[02:22:17.566 --> 02:22:22.091]  And that's really, I mean, I've studied the sociology, I've studied the history of it, that's what's happening.
[02:22:22.531 --> 02:22:28.937]  The Mexican government has been very, very oppressive, and any time they do something bad to the Mexican people, they say, it's America's fault, it's the U.S.
[02:22:28.977 --> 02:22:35.203]  fault, they stole the Southwest from us, when in truth, they're only in the entire Southwest under 10,000 Mexicans.
[02:22:37.225 --> 02:22:39.947]  Most of them wanted to be part of Texas because they had more freedom.
[02:22:40.608 --> 02:22:48.133]  Again, a third of the people that fought in it, the founders, the guy that wrote the Constitution, Navarro, were Hispanic.
[02:22:49.234 --> 02:22:50.515]  Santa Ana was a dictator.
[02:22:51.655 --> 02:22:57.119]  But they've been taught from birth, especially in the last 30, 40 years, that the Southwest is Mexico.
[02:22:57.179 --> 02:22:57.800]  We conquer it.
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:00.582]  And Mexican presidents, the last three, have all said that.
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:02.942]  And then why is our government playing along?
[02:23:23.567 --> 02:23:27.131]  Lupi, do you agree with the statement I just made about what's taught in Mexican schools?
[02:23:27.711 --> 02:23:28.312]  Absolutely.
[02:23:28.873 --> 02:23:42.807]  Not only in Mexican schools, the Mexican government has come into California with their Mexican consulates, and they have infiltrated our community-based organizations, and they have even gone into our schools
[02:23:43.799 --> 02:23:44.320]  Giving.
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:48.082]  They give thousands and thousands of free books.
[02:23:48.522 --> 02:23:51.544]  But what it does, it teaches the Mexican Constitution.
[02:23:51.924 --> 02:23:58.389]  And it teaches that our flag is a foreign enemy flag and that we're an imperialist country.
[02:23:59.009 --> 02:24:02.791]  And they even go into the libraries and give books to the libraries.
[02:24:03.272 --> 02:24:04.913]  And they do it smiling.
[02:24:04.953 --> 02:24:06.754]  This is what I don't understand about Americans.
[02:24:06.814 --> 02:24:08.275]  Why are we letting this happen?
[02:24:08.295 --> 02:24:09.536]  It's like a Trojan horse.
[02:24:09.916 --> 02:24:11.677]  They come bearing gifts to kill us.
[02:24:12.526 --> 02:24:15.668]  And we sit here like nobody's doing anything.
[02:24:16.229 --> 02:24:24.195]  I listen to the news once in a while, and they're talking about baseball games when our country is in serious, serious danger.
[02:24:24.435 --> 02:24:27.217]  We all need to get up and fight this.
[02:24:27.778 --> 02:24:30.760]  By the way, Vicente Fox almost three years ago came to Austin.
[02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:32.221]  I bullhorned him and shut it down.
[02:24:32.702 --> 02:24:34.223]  I put it on TV, but never on the web.
[02:24:34.263 --> 02:24:35.464]  I've got to dig that out.
[02:24:36.525 --> 02:24:37.746]  In fact, Mike Hanson, you're listening.
[02:24:37.806 --> 02:24:38.406]  Find that show.
[02:24:38.426 --> 02:24:39.167]  I want to re-air it.
[02:24:39.687 --> 02:24:41.429]  And I shut down his speech with a bullhorn.
[02:24:41.469 --> 02:24:49.216]  He was giving an award to the Austin police and to the mayor for letting the reconquista go on openly.
[02:24:49.256 --> 02:24:58.704]  And he gave an award to Wells Fargo for issuing them debit cards, which then the state is accepting as a form of ID to then get welfare, bank accounts, everything else.
[02:24:59.345 --> 02:25:00.987]  And then on top of that...
[02:25:01.767 --> 02:25:02.887]  It gets even worse.
[02:25:03.427 --> 02:25:13.050]  Governor Rick Perry's head of Texas-Mexico relations is a Mexican citizen who is at the same time a lobbyist, the head lobbyist for Mexico to Texas.
[02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:17.971]  I mean, their officials, Mexican government officials, are now becoming our rulers.
[02:25:18.411 --> 02:25:19.171]  Well, you know what?
[02:25:19.211 --> 02:25:29.354]  There is a man here in Orange County called Carlos Olamende, very good friend of Fox, but also a very good friend of Bush.
[02:25:29.924 --> 02:25:31.865]  And he is Bush's advisor.
[02:25:32.266 --> 02:25:40.471]  And I'm thinking, and this man has dual citizenship, and his number one aim is to have amnesty for 12 million illegal aliens.
[02:25:40.972 --> 02:25:43.073]  We just cannot have that.
[02:25:43.814 --> 02:25:58.264]  We are just, you know what, for being Americans and probably the smartest people in the world, our leadership is just plain dumb and stupid, and there are a bunch of globalists and elitists that we need to just get rid of.
[02:25:59.648 --> 02:26:00.629]  Wake up, America.
[02:26:00.669 --> 02:26:01.389]  We're in trouble.
[02:26:01.769 --> 02:26:02.490]  Well, you're right.
[02:26:02.610 --> 02:26:06.231]  It's stupid for America, but it's good for the elite to break down this country.
[02:26:07.052 --> 02:26:08.212]  Well, we can't have that.
[02:26:08.272 --> 02:26:14.535]  I mean, our founding fathers, the framers of this country, that's their number one thing that they were worried about.
[02:26:14.575 --> 02:26:18.377]  That's why they worked so hard on the Constitution.
[02:26:19.017 --> 02:26:23.679]  These men are betraying everything that these...
[02:26:24.281 --> 02:26:30.724]  The framers stood for it, and they're betraying the men and women that have died to give us the freedoms that we have.
[02:26:31.024 --> 02:26:31.504]  I agree.
[02:26:31.764 --> 02:26:35.526]  How long until you think we're going to see bloody riots and burning cities?
[02:26:36.687 --> 02:26:38.788]  Nobody has said anything.
[02:26:39.068 --> 02:26:52.554]  In Santa Ana, we had on March 23, they actually invaded government buildings, chased down government workers, and stabbed them with Mexican flags
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:58.688]  And I went to talk to the Board of Supervisors yesterday because I know the film is there.
[02:26:59.068 --> 02:27:00.430]  I've seen the film.
[02:27:00.450 --> 02:27:04.396]  And they sit there so calmly like...
[02:27:05.095 --> 02:27:07.056]  Like they're going to a church picnic.
[02:27:07.216 --> 02:27:10.297]  Well, the cops stood there and let them attack them.
[02:27:11.377 --> 02:27:21.121]  Now, for those that don't know, it was in the AP that they threw things at police, but it's now been in some of the independent news services, and Lupe, you said you've seen the tape, that they were physically attacking.
[02:27:21.181 --> 02:27:21.701]  Stay there!
[02:27:22.001 --> 02:27:23.242]  We're going to write an article about this.
[02:27:23.262 --> 02:27:27.263]  You tell us exactly what happened, and we'll get an article out by tomorrow.
[02:27:27.943 --> 02:27:30.484]  Stay there with the Moreno, and we'll take your calls on the other side.
[02:27:30.504 --> 02:27:31.585]  This is very important.
[02:27:33.579 --> 02:27:34.459]  We're on the march.
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:36.560]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:44.391]  Come on, Bill.
[02:29:44.611 --> 02:29:46.431]  Two weeks ago, you were riding the bicycle.
[02:29:46.631 --> 02:29:49.772]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:29:50.113 --> 02:29:50.673]  What did you do?
[02:29:50.793 --> 02:29:51.613]  Rob Bill Gates?
[02:29:51.713 --> 02:29:53.674]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:29:53.954 --> 02:29:59.496]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:29:59.776 --> 02:30:06.038]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:06.358 --> 02:30:08.579]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:08.879 --> 02:30:11.720]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:15.683]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:30:15.703 --> 02:30:16.323]  Whoa.
[02:30:16.724 --> 02:30:17.924]  What was that website again?
[02:30:18.005 --> 02:30:21.487]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:30:21.787 --> 02:30:22.908]  Now write this down, John.
[02:30:23.048 --> 02:30:27.351]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:30:27.492 --> 02:30:28.072]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:29.553]  I'm going there right now.
[02:30:29.953 --> 02:30:30.594]  Check, please.
[02:30:32.357 --> 02:30:33.838]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:30:34.318 --> 02:30:34.918]  Sure, John.
[02:30:35.139 --> 02:30:39.501]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:30:39.801 --> 02:30:41.522]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:30:41.662 --> 02:30:42.022]  Deal.
[02:30:49.926 --> 02:30:54.368]  The sleeping giant that is America is awakening.
[02:30:55.525 --> 02:30:56.747]  Everybody can be part of this.
[02:30:56.787 --> 02:30:58.589]  I don't care if you're Hispanic, black, white.
[02:30:58.629 --> 02:30:59.470]  It doesn't matter.
[02:31:00.130 --> 02:31:01.612]  We've got to defend this country.
[02:31:01.672 --> 02:31:10.401]  Listen, the CFR last year, Lou Dobbs even covered it, came out with their border plan, wide open borders, total legalization, merger with Canada and Mexico.
[02:31:10.481 --> 02:31:10.922]  It's happening.
[02:31:10.982 --> 02:31:11.663]  It's like the EU.
[02:31:12.657 --> 02:31:28.171]  The same elites over there, you know, bring in, nothing against Muslims, folks, but they'll bring in, you know, five, ten million, depending on the country, three million in smaller countries, and then they start rioting and going nuts, and the government uses them as like a client to threaten the population into submission.
[02:31:28.571 --> 02:31:29.492]  We're talking to Lupi Moreno.
[02:31:29.512 --> 02:31:31.674]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a minute or two, but...
[02:31:32.466 --> 02:31:40.071]  Libby, we confirmed, the Orange County Register confirmed, AP confirmed that they were throwing bottles, rocks, big marbles at cops.
[02:31:40.231 --> 02:31:42.052]  We got photos of the cops taking it.
[02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:44.974]  I know that they were charging around in some government buildings.
[02:31:45.255 --> 02:31:51.118]  Give us the names, the full details, because we're going to do a story off of... And you say you've seen some of the footage.
[02:31:51.138 --> 02:31:51.679]  Tell us about it.
[02:31:51.979 --> 02:31:55.481]  Well, people are terrified to come forward.
[02:31:56.002 --> 02:31:57.843]  And it seems like I've become...
[02:31:58.430 --> 02:32:18.020]  The person they come to when nobody can't say it, they're too terrified to say it, they give me the information and somebody, I heard the rumors and somebody actually showed me the tape of county workers looking out because they heard noise and then they seen a bunch of people beating up on cars.
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:21.402]  So they went out with their cell phones and started taking pictures.
[02:32:21.982 --> 02:32:28.165]  When the crowd realized they were taking pictures, they ran, chased the county workers
[02:32:29.006 --> 02:32:31.648]  And one actually got stabbed with a Mexican flag.
[02:32:32.148 --> 02:32:40.934]  Then my daughter, I live in Santa Ana, and the footage you've seen about the police getting beat up, it happened here on Monday night, May 1st.
[02:32:41.635 --> 02:32:53.083]  The thing is, is that the street they closed down is one of our major streets, and when they closed down that major street, they actually pushed the crowd into my block.
[02:32:53.563 --> 02:32:56.285]  So I had my children calling me terrified,
[02:32:56.812 --> 02:33:00.253]  That there was people just all over the place.
[02:33:00.573 --> 02:33:08.296]  And you see, on my bumper sticker, I have actually Secure the Borders, Close the Borders, and Minuteman Project, because I am a Minuteman.
[02:33:08.817 --> 02:33:11.778]  And so my kids said, you know, Mom, we need to turn your car around.
[02:33:11.818 --> 02:33:13.258]  People are starting to look at your car.
[02:33:13.879 --> 02:33:20.461]  And I was on my way to church, but what happened is they literally called out the SWAT team.
[02:33:20.621 --> 02:33:25.503]  The SWAT team went out, and they started throwing rocks and bottles at the SWAT team here in Santa Ana.
[02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:37.056]  Now, back to March 27th, it was nowhere, nobody heard anything, but they actually ran into a local school, high school here.
[02:33:37.597 --> 02:33:46.802]  They send in the SWAT teams because the kids wanted to take down the American flag, and I guess the principal thought that they were going to shoot the kids.
[02:33:46.842 --> 02:33:51.865]  They were so out of control that we have something called a school police, Santa Ana
[02:33:53.228 --> 02:33:53.949]  School police.
[02:33:54.069 --> 02:34:03.535]  They went in and basically they held their ground, saved the flag from being torn down, but the kids went crazy and messed up the school.
[02:34:04.096 --> 02:34:12.942]  I went to the school board to talk about this, and they sat there and acted like, I don't know, so passive, like lambs.
[02:34:13.002 --> 02:34:16.544]  I'm thinking, my God, our city is being destroyed by these
[02:34:17.250 --> 02:34:22.615]  Foreign invaders, and you're sitting there and not saying one single word.
[02:34:22.675 --> 02:34:26.078]  So we are literally, we could be days, weeks, months away.
[02:34:26.539 --> 02:34:38.150]  Our buildings are, if they have the nerve, I found out by different people throughout the city that just come and whisper in my ear, five county government buildings
[02:34:38.706 --> 02:34:40.268]  We're broken into.
[02:34:40.549 --> 02:34:42.031]  They tried to get into them.
[02:34:42.892 --> 02:34:48.920]  Every time they say they're going to have a rally now, the county actually locks down the buildings.
[02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:51.564]  So my daughter is back in the middle of this
[02:34:51.997 --> 02:34:57.220]  She's sitting there locked in a government building because they're afraid that they're going to come in.
[02:34:57.321 --> 02:34:59.722]  What in the world do they want to do to government workers?
[02:34:59.742 --> 02:35:02.644]  I mean, what is that reasoning?
[02:35:03.024 --> 02:35:11.110]  And if the government isn't saying anything and all these people don't realize that they're in danger, my daughter does because she knows, you know, she lives with me.
[02:35:11.130 --> 02:35:13.091]  Well, the government's trying to legalize them.
[02:35:13.731 --> 02:35:15.933]  Absolutely the government's trying to legalize them.
[02:35:16.213 --> 02:35:19.055]  The worst thing that could happen to this nation again is
[02:35:19.395 --> 02:35:23.157]  is another amnesty or guest worker program, and I'll tell you exactly why.
[02:35:23.237 --> 02:35:25.419]  Well, before we do that, I want to go back specifically.
[02:35:25.439 --> 02:35:26.840]  Tell us the names of the schools.
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:30.182]  Tell us the name of another building.
[02:35:30.402 --> 02:35:30.982]  Hold on, Lupe.
[02:35:31.182 --> 02:35:35.865]  And then describe to us, please, ma'am, what you saw on the tape you were allowed to see.
[02:35:36.706 --> 02:35:41.388]  The tape that I've seen, and I'm going to write my own report.
[02:35:41.428 --> 02:35:42.669]  I just haven't had a chance.
[02:35:43.490 --> 02:35:48.693]  What I've seen was kids, county workers first looking out the window,
[02:35:49.764 --> 02:35:54.167]  County workers going to take pictures with their cell phones.
[02:35:54.727 --> 02:35:57.849]  Then all of a sudden they start running back towards the building.
[02:35:58.409 --> 02:36:10.777]  I see all these kids with Mexican flags and there is this woman in there and she turns around and starts running and then the men start running and then you can see all these people and they weren't just kids.
[02:36:10.857 --> 02:36:14.099]  Some were like adults and then the kids were behind them.
[02:36:14.460 --> 02:36:18.162]  But you could see this guy chasing this man down
[02:36:18.797 --> 02:36:26.322]  And he plunges the stick of his flagpole into this man's chest, and then it stops.
[02:36:26.862 --> 02:36:28.283]  But it was a Mexican flag.
[02:36:28.323 --> 02:36:29.724]  Now, is this a Mexican flag?
[02:36:29.764 --> 02:36:32.006]  Is this a surveillance camera or someone with a video camera?
[02:36:32.166 --> 02:36:33.847]  It was a surveillance camera.
[02:36:34.007 --> 02:36:36.809]  I did go to the Board of Supervisors yesterday.
[02:36:36.949 --> 02:36:38.190]  Oh, we've got to have that tape.
[02:36:38.290 --> 02:36:40.231]  And I demanded that tape.
[02:36:40.391 --> 02:36:47.536]  Now, I tell you, I had county workers come up to me afterwards and whisper and thank me.
[02:36:48.563 --> 02:36:49.805]  You know, this report can't wait.
[02:36:49.865 --> 02:36:51.406]  I'm telling my staff in the room right now.
[02:36:51.586 --> 02:36:52.788]  Very intimidated.
[02:36:53.608 --> 02:36:56.691]  County workers are very intimidated in Santa Ana.
[02:36:56.711 --> 02:36:58.994]  This is the city of Santa Ana.
[02:36:59.334 --> 02:37:01.576]  We are in the United States.
[02:37:01.736 --> 02:37:06.621]  Even though they spray painted down my street, that major street is called Bristol.
[02:37:06.961 --> 02:37:09.404]  Even though they spray painted, this is Mexico.
[02:37:09.995 --> 02:37:10.275]  No.
[02:37:10.595 --> 02:37:12.896]  This is the United States of America.
[02:37:13.136 --> 02:37:17.537]  And as Americans of all colors, it doesn't matter what party you belong to anymore.
[02:37:18.138 --> 02:37:21.339]  Our country is in serious, serious trouble.
[02:37:21.839 --> 02:37:28.301]  My children do not want to live in the city they were born anymore because we have been taken over so badly.
[02:37:28.321 --> 02:37:32.422]  78% of my neighbors are illegal aliens.
[02:37:33.311 --> 02:37:34.272]  And you know what they tell me?
[02:37:34.312 --> 02:37:35.873]  They tell me California is lost.
[02:37:35.953 --> 02:37:37.654]  Well, no, California is not lost.
[02:37:37.714 --> 02:37:41.597]  As long as one of us is here fighting, California is not lost.
[02:37:41.717 --> 02:37:49.143]  We will continue to fight, and we will save it, even with these passive lambs that don't believe that this is going on.
[02:37:50.618 --> 02:37:52.039]  I'm sorry I get so emotional.
[02:37:52.059 --> 02:37:52.679]  No, that's okay.
[02:37:52.699 --> 02:37:53.800]  We should get emotional.
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:57.301]  America's dying on the altar of globalism right now.
[02:37:57.381 --> 02:37:57.822]  Believe me.
[02:37:58.182 --> 02:37:59.602]  Ma'am, I guess it was eight years ago.
[02:37:59.622 --> 02:38:00.683]  I told the story last hour.
[02:38:00.743 --> 02:38:08.207]  I was asked down to speak at Texas Independence Day by the young conservatives and the UT Longhorn libertarians.
[02:38:08.327 --> 02:38:14.550]  And people in Aztec outfits ran up screaming racist stuff, grabbed the birthday cake, gobbled it, spit it all over the cake.
[02:38:14.970 --> 02:38:15.651]  It's just a hatred of us.
[02:38:15.671 --> 02:38:16.431]  There's a total hatred.
[02:38:16.451 --> 02:38:18.012]  I think it's because this nation is a blessed nation.
[02:38:18.072 --> 02:38:21.374]  We have people that sacrifice for this nation so this nation continues to be blessed.
[02:38:37.702 --> 02:38:44.253]  And they come from a nation that isn't blessed because of their corruption, the way they've treated their people and their nation.
[02:38:44.293 --> 02:38:45.576]  So it's not a blessed nation.
[02:38:45.616 --> 02:38:48.160]  So they come over here and they envy us.
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:49.803]  They covet what we have.
[02:38:50.296 --> 02:38:52.457]  And, you know, that's against God's plan.
[02:38:52.517 --> 02:38:54.798]  That's totally against God's plan.
[02:38:55.218 --> 02:38:58.499]  These people are just so full of hate.
[02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:00.500]  Well, I think you hit on something key here.
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:05.662]  They're not allowed to protest or demonstrate or stand up against the PRI or FOX or any of the groups in Mexico.
[02:39:05.983 --> 02:39:11.285]  So Mexico is exporting its angry populations and scapegoating America.
[02:39:11.825 --> 02:39:12.465]  Absolutely.
[02:39:12.965 --> 02:39:13.906]  Absolutely.
[02:39:14.446 --> 02:39:18.647]  Lupe, you were going to try to tell a story about... I mean, the real numbers are over 25 million.
[02:39:18.687 --> 02:39:21.308]  I mean, we can use their number of 12, 14 million, whatever.
[02:39:21.808 --> 02:39:24.888]  And the anchor babies, the jackpot babies, whatever you want to call it.
[02:39:25.789 --> 02:39:28.349]  I mean, Mexico's population doubling every 35 years.
[02:39:28.369 --> 02:39:31.170]  They're all being taught they're going to, quote, racially take over.
[02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:34.811]  I mean, yes, we've got to defeat Bush's amnesty.
[02:39:35.291 --> 02:39:35.931]  Absolutely.
[02:39:36.031 --> 02:39:40.152]  And the reason why is because we do not have the money to...
[02:39:42.395 --> 02:39:44.156]  We don't have money for enforcement.
[02:39:44.176 --> 02:39:45.757]  That's what happened in 1986.
[02:39:45.958 --> 02:39:48.259]  There was no money for anything.
[02:39:48.459 --> 02:39:57.065]  We've got hundreds of billions in the last 10 years to pay for all the welfare for the illegals and their tuition, but we don't have a few billion to secure our borders and deport these people.
[02:39:57.546 --> 02:39:58.786]  There is no money.
[02:39:58.847 --> 02:40:01.909]  There is no money to enforce anything.
[02:40:02.189 --> 02:40:06.732]  So what they did, they actually got the community-based organizations involved
[02:40:07.071 --> 02:40:22.638]  The same La Raza group, the same Hermandad Mexicana group, the same community, anything, the Catholic, what is it, the Catholic charities, they used all these minority groups to actually do all the work.
[02:40:22.738 --> 02:40:23.759]  And what did they do?
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:29.101]  I would say two-thirds of the people that actually...
[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:31.540]  What is it?
[02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:34.161]  Received amnesty didn't even qualify.
[02:40:34.201 --> 02:40:35.361]  They weren't even here.
[02:40:35.821 --> 02:40:40.943]  It corrupted the system because all they needed was one paper with a certain date.
[02:40:41.083 --> 02:40:41.663]  Well, you're right.
[02:40:41.683 --> 02:40:49.345]  They've got the foxes guarding the hen house where the illegal alien advocacy groups were the ones that set up the amnesty citizen program and implemented it.
[02:40:49.845 --> 02:40:50.385]  Absolutely.
[02:40:50.425 --> 02:40:51.025]  That's what happened.
[02:40:51.045 --> 02:40:52.286]  That's what happened in California.
[02:40:52.546 --> 02:40:54.746]  And they were giving the people the answers.
[02:40:55.106 --> 02:40:56.887]  Lupe, what do you... And we're going to take some calls.
[02:40:56.947 --> 02:40:59.307]  People have been very patient and you've been great to join us.
[02:40:59.327 --> 02:41:00.787]  I want you to stay with us for the calls.
[02:41:00.867 --> 02:41:02.128]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:41:02.448 --> 02:41:03.528]  When do you think it will happen?
[02:41:03.548 --> 02:41:05.528]  And what's going to happen when they start burning down the cities?
[02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.849]  It's scary.
[02:41:08.669 --> 02:41:17.371]  It's totally scary at this point because I know for sure that our law enforcement knows and they're keeping quiet.
[02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:18.450]  I hate to say it.
[02:41:47.294 --> 02:41:48.801]  I'm not going to say that.
[02:41:48.822 --> 02:41:50.208]  Let me describe this for people.
[02:41:50.228 --> 02:41:51.233]  Let me see if I can get this straight.
[02:41:51.892 --> 02:41:59.834]  There was teachers and school police, campus police could barely hold off the illegal alien students from getting the flag.
[02:41:59.874 --> 02:42:13.578]  When the SWAT team got there, you have the police and administration around the flagpole literally guarding it with the hordes like hyenas trying to get at a baby hippo, and the SWAT team had to stop it.
[02:42:13.618 --> 02:42:14.318]  Is that what happened?
[02:42:14.738 --> 02:42:18.719]  Well, the principal was scared that the SWAT team was going to shoot the kids,
[02:42:19.079 --> 02:42:25.046]  So they actually only let the school staff and school police stand by the flag.
[02:42:25.967 --> 02:42:30.473]  And so then the students threw a fit, rioted, and tore up the school.
[02:42:30.513 --> 02:42:31.394]  How bad did they tear it up?
[02:42:32.115 --> 02:42:38.262]  Now, when I went to the school board, they said that it was minor, if nothing, damage.
[02:42:38.703 --> 02:42:43.986]  That there is a film also about that, and I'm trying to get that film also.
[02:42:44.066 --> 02:42:46.047]  Well, what did you hear from the witnesses really happened?
[02:42:46.888 --> 02:42:51.851]  What I heard what really happened was exactly what I said, that the SWAT team was called in.
[02:42:51.931 --> 02:42:53.051]  The principal got scared.
[02:42:53.071 --> 02:43:04.218]  They thought they might shoot some of the kids, so they brought in the school police and the staff, and they went around that flag, and they held their ground and did not let the flag fall.
[02:43:04.847 --> 02:43:05.647]  Get taken down.
[02:43:05.687 --> 02:43:13.631]  So specifically, what I envision in my mind's eye, the school police and teachers and the principal literally in a ring around the American flag.
[02:43:13.931 --> 02:43:15.431]  That's what it's come to in this country.
[02:43:15.651 --> 02:43:21.094]  And we know in Arizona and other areas, they've jerked down the American flag, put the Mexican flag up there.
[02:43:21.294 --> 02:43:23.415]  Have you seen the video of them burning American flags?
[02:43:23.755 --> 02:43:24.315]  Absolutely.
[02:43:24.335 --> 02:43:29.237]  Not only that, in Montevideo, where they have the flag, it's all over the Internet.
[02:43:29.557 --> 02:43:39.107]  They actually did put the Mexican flag first, and then they put the American flag upside down, not realizing that the American flag upside down means we're in distrust.
[02:43:39.428 --> 02:43:40.849]  I said, that's the perfect symbol.
[02:43:41.370 --> 02:43:41.870]  They did it.
[02:43:42.411 --> 02:43:43.352]  They actually did it.
[02:43:44.485 --> 02:43:46.166]  And so what is that telling us?
[02:43:46.407 --> 02:43:52.150]  And these kids, I don't know if you've seen the videos, but they actually ran into our freeways.
[02:43:52.310 --> 02:43:54.492]  Our freeways do not go slow.
[02:43:54.892 --> 02:43:58.414]  Our freeways go very fast, and they're six-lane freeways.
[02:43:58.814 --> 02:44:01.216]  And these kids actually stopped the freeways.
[02:44:01.676 --> 02:44:02.717]  I know, it's insane.
[02:44:03.497 --> 02:44:04.878]  Give us the website.
[02:44:05.078 --> 02:44:09.181]  It's latinoamericans.org, but give us any other information.
[02:44:09.201 --> 02:44:10.282]  I'm almost speechless here, folks.
[02:44:10.762 --> 02:44:12.303]  Any other information?
[02:44:12.463 --> 02:44:14.945]  I'm going to Texas this weekend.
[02:44:15.005 --> 02:44:17.907]  We're going to have a reckoning in Crawford, Texas.
[02:44:18.007 --> 02:44:18.887]  I'm going to be there.
[02:44:18.967 --> 02:44:20.268]  We do have that website.
[02:44:20.648 --> 02:44:24.411]  It's areckoning.com if you guys want to join us in Texas.
[02:44:25.012 --> 02:44:28.754]  Everybody that's anybody in the immigration movement will be there.
[02:44:29.615 --> 02:44:30.275]  Visit us.
[02:44:30.595 --> 02:44:31.556]  We will be talking.
[02:44:31.596 --> 02:44:32.796]  We will be discussing.
[02:44:32.816 --> 02:44:34.657]  We will try to strategize.
[02:44:34.717 --> 02:44:39.780]  We might even ask for, you know what, we need to get rid of all these elitists in the Senate.
[02:44:40.521 --> 02:44:44.683]  That's what we've come down to, a bunch of elitists in the Senate.
[02:44:44.703 --> 02:44:53.728]  And Congress, thank you, Jesus, at least Congress is still standing to a point that we have a lot of congressmen that are La Raza.
[02:44:54.412 --> 02:44:55.533]  A lot of congressmen.
[02:44:55.653 --> 02:45:07.238]  Xavier Becerra out of Los Angeles, Luis Gutierrez out of Illinois, and then we have all the foolish, foolish, stupid congressmen that think they're going to sing Kumbaya with these people.
[02:45:07.278 --> 02:45:09.059]  These people do not want to sing Kumbaya with us.
[02:45:09.079 --> 02:45:09.979]  No, they want to take over.
[02:45:10.239 --> 02:45:10.459]  Yes.
[02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:14.201]  It's the same old corrupt system in Mexico, and they're conning their people.
[02:45:14.241 --> 02:45:16.442]  They want to just rule over them like king rats.
[02:45:17.122 --> 02:45:18.263]  Let's take a few calls here.
[02:45:18.743 --> 02:45:20.104]  Jeff and Mass, thanks for holding.
[02:45:20.124 --> 02:45:22.385]  You're on the air with a great American hero, Lupin Moreno.
[02:45:23.258 --> 02:45:23.979]  Totally agreed.
[02:45:24.219 --> 02:45:31.465]  Now, the satanic trinity that's doing this to America is Washington, D.C., Moscow, and Beijing.
[02:45:31.945 --> 02:45:37.650]  Now, Lupe, if you ever read the book called Through the Eyes of the Enemy by Stanislav Lunov, which is a brilliant book,
[02:45:38.257 --> 02:45:41.760]  There is a three-stage plan to collapse this country.
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:45.143]  The softening process, the breakdown, and reconstruction.
[02:45:45.463 --> 02:45:47.425]  This is Red Dawn in slow motion.
[02:45:47.986 --> 02:45:48.946]  Yes, indeed.
[02:45:48.966 --> 02:45:50.087]  Yes, it is.
[02:45:50.428 --> 02:46:00.136]  Now, on page 22 of the book, which I'm not going to read, I'm just going to highlight, one of the high points of the GRU is getting intelligence for the assassination of our political leaders.
[02:46:00.437 --> 02:46:01.798]  That's the hard warfare.
[02:46:02.138 --> 02:46:05.301]  The soft warfare is illegal immigration, drugs,
[02:46:05.902 --> 02:46:06.543]  We're good to go.
[02:46:25.726 --> 02:46:26.846]  It's very frightening.
[02:46:26.946 --> 02:46:33.708]  Well, when they burn our cities, the media is going to tell us it's all our fault, and we'll have to give total amnesty and learn how to step and fetch it.
[02:46:34.068 --> 02:46:35.168]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[02:46:35.188 --> 02:46:37.348]  Well, let's talk to Skunk in Missouri.
[02:46:37.428 --> 02:46:38.248]  Skunk, go ahead.
[02:46:38.969 --> 02:46:39.689]  Hey, guys.
[02:46:39.749 --> 02:46:40.569]  How are you doing today?
[02:46:40.649 --> 02:46:40.869]  Good.
[02:46:41.789 --> 02:46:42.649]  I just want to comment.
[02:46:42.709 --> 02:46:43.929]  I actually have a two-part comment.
[02:46:44.130 --> 02:46:51.871]  One is I remember I was watching cable news last Friday when this butchered version of our national anthem was going to be aired.
[02:46:52.367 --> 02:46:55.088]  And they actually had a translation broken down so you could read it.
[02:46:55.108 --> 02:47:05.672]  I remember reading one of the passages, basically said that, you know, the America that you knew was over, you're waking up to a new day, and we are going to control this day from here on forward.
[02:47:06.413 --> 02:47:14.556]  If people don't realize right there that that is a declaration of war, they are trying to dismantle our sovereignty, they are trying to invade every facet of our lives.
[02:47:14.915 --> 02:47:16.176]  I'm not against immigration.
[02:47:16.216 --> 02:47:17.757]  Both of my parents are from Germany.
[02:47:18.218 --> 02:47:19.239]  I am an American citizen.
[02:47:19.299 --> 02:47:21.020]  It doesn't matter where my parents are.
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:26.785]  I'll keep you over it, but Lope, you've heard the text of that, and it starts out with Papa of our race.
[02:47:26.805 --> 02:47:30.648]  It starts out with talking about Raza.
[02:47:30.888 --> 02:47:33.590]  What are you hearing and seeing in the different versions that are out there?
[02:47:34.211 --> 02:47:34.711]  Well, you know what?
[02:47:34.751 --> 02:47:36.913]  I've only listened to one version myself.
[02:47:37.615 --> 02:47:41.217]  And when a reporter called to ask me about it, I said, you know what?
[02:47:41.317 --> 02:47:43.178]  This is going to open a can of worms.
[02:47:43.338 --> 02:47:45.579]  It's going to be a hornet's nest.
[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:47.100]  I said, because you know what?
[02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:52.563]  Even though I am a Latina, I don't want to even hear that version.
[02:47:52.683 --> 02:47:53.844]  I don't want to hear it.
[02:47:54.144 --> 02:47:55.765]  I don't want it near me.
[02:47:55.905 --> 02:48:00.327]  I said, if you don't realize that American Latinos are Americans.
[02:48:00.767 --> 02:48:02.488]  We love nation.
[02:48:02.608 --> 02:48:03.489]  We do not.
[02:48:04.346 --> 02:48:06.047]  Do not want to hear nothing in Spanish.
[02:48:06.187 --> 02:48:09.750]  Well, they also changed the... The lyrics!
[02:48:10.090 --> 02:48:13.312]  I could see if they'd translate, but they didn't translate it.
[02:48:13.332 --> 02:48:14.573]  They changed the lyrics.
[02:48:15.094 --> 02:48:16.655]  Anything else, Skunk?
[02:48:17.355 --> 02:48:23.099]  Yes, I'm just concerned about the acceleration of the protests and the beginning of the violence in the protests.
[02:48:23.139 --> 02:48:29.864]  I think in the next few months we are actually going to see an explosion of illegals versus citizens.
[02:48:30.144 --> 02:48:30.565]  And I mean...
[02:48:31.443 --> 02:48:33.504]  We already have it.
[02:48:33.605 --> 02:48:35.426]  They don't show the problems.
[02:48:35.466 --> 02:48:39.128]  We've been protesting and protesting for at least the last year.
[02:48:39.148 --> 02:48:40.429]  I tell you what, stay there.
[02:48:40.489 --> 02:48:41.149]  Final segment.
[02:48:41.170 --> 02:48:42.130]  Skunk, you stay there too.
[02:48:42.430 --> 02:48:47.714]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:47.894 --> 02:48:52.237]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.077 --> 02:48:56.839]  Disaster is a new world order.
[02:48:56.919 --> 02:48:59.703]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:49:00.003 --> 02:49:04.229]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:04.289 --> 02:49:11.218]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:11.358 --> 02:49:13.361]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:13.601 --> 02:49:24.103]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:24.343 --> 02:49:29.704]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:49:30.204 --> 02:49:32.864]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:49:32.964 --> 02:49:34.125]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:49:34.665 --> 02:49:36.445]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:43.209 --> 02:49:48.172]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[02:49:48.472 --> 02:49:50.714]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:49:50.774 --> 02:49:53.916]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:49:53.956 --> 02:49:58.258]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:49:58.579 --> 02:50:01.601]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:50:01.921 --> 02:50:05.343]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:50:05.663 --> 02:50:15.027]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:15.287 --> 02:50:18.789]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:51:49.334 --> 02:51:52.036]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.568 --> 02:51:59.730]  Folks, I'm so busy that I have to cut a live promo for a local radio station here live on air.
[02:51:59.750 --> 02:52:03.732]  And then we're going to go back to Lupe Moreno and let two callers finish up.
[02:52:04.392 --> 02:52:08.494]  KLBJAM has been trying to figure out a way to get this show on Monday through Friday.
[02:52:09.535 --> 02:52:10.335]  They contacted us.
[02:52:10.355 --> 02:52:13.136]  They wanted on, but I told them I can't do two shows a day.
[02:52:13.676 --> 02:52:17.118]  But I'm going to go the next few weekends and do a Sunday show there from noon to 2 p.m.
[02:52:17.758 --> 02:52:22.160]  And my other voiceover rig is hooked up right now for voiceovers on the new film, and I'm so busy.
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:26.843]  I have to do this right now, live on air, three 10-second promos.
[02:52:26.923 --> 02:52:27.583]  So bear with me.
[02:52:27.603 --> 02:52:30.504]  When you talk about multitasking, here it is.
[02:52:30.985 --> 02:52:32.345]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:32.385 --> 02:52:35.167]  Be sure and join me this Sunday from noon to 2 p.m.
[02:52:35.467 --> 02:52:38.228]  right here on KOBJ, 590 a.m.
[02:52:38.248 --> 02:52:39.248]  You're not going to want to miss it.
[02:52:40.129 --> 02:52:40.789]  That sound all right?
[02:52:40.809 --> 02:52:41.490]  Let's try another one.
[02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:43.310]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:43.330 --> 02:52:44.311]  That didn't sound good.
[02:52:46.405 --> 02:52:47.726]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:47.786 --> 02:52:53.510]  Be sure and join me coming up this Sunday on KLBJ 590 AM from noon to 2 PM.
[02:52:53.550 --> 02:52:55.552]  You don't want to miss what... That's not good.
[02:52:55.692 --> 02:52:58.034]  I get nervous doing this live on air.
[02:52:58.514 --> 02:52:59.775]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:59.835 --> 02:53:05.920]  Be sure and join me this Sunday right here on KLBJ 590 AM from noon to 2 PM.
[02:53:06.060 --> 02:53:07.040]  You can edit that, can't you?
[02:53:07.761 --> 02:53:09.963]  And there's one more for live on that day.
[02:53:11.944 --> 02:53:15.647]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here inviting you to join me coming up today at noon...
[02:53:16.423 --> 02:53:18.785]  Hey folks, Alex Jones, I can't do it live.
[02:53:19.486 --> 02:53:21.768]  The network's so busy, they won't let me do it after.
[02:53:22.268 --> 02:53:22.828]  After the show.
[02:53:22.848 --> 02:53:24.390]  Can you believe the position I'm in here?
[02:53:25.183 --> 02:53:26.024]  It's insane.
[02:53:26.164 --> 02:53:26.984]  Support the networks.
[02:53:27.024 --> 02:53:29.926]  They've got more money so they can have two people there so I can do this.
[02:53:30.326 --> 02:53:32.167]  Lupi Moreno, I've never done that before on air.
[02:53:32.207 --> 02:53:35.369]  Actually, I've cut promos for affiliates live on air before.
[02:53:35.549 --> 02:53:36.890]  But that's how busy I am.
[02:53:36.930 --> 02:53:38.410]  This is how insane my life is.
[02:53:39.091 --> 02:53:41.872]  Lupi, the Reckoning is coming up this Sunday, isn't it?
[02:53:42.473 --> 02:53:44.314]  Actually, it's this Saturday.
[02:53:44.354 --> 02:53:47.115]  Saturday, 1 p.m., yeah.
[02:53:47.195 --> 02:53:53.859]  My mother is from Texas, so we're going to go tomorrow and visit family that I've never seen, and then we're going to a Reckoning.
[02:53:54.990 --> 02:54:00.172]  And hopefully we could... Oh, I hate to say that word, but you know what?
[02:54:00.272 --> 02:54:06.815]  I've gotten to the point where I almost think this president needs to be impeached, not for everything else, but for this issue alone.
[02:54:07.495 --> 02:54:08.995]  Our borders are not secure.
[02:54:09.496 --> 02:54:13.917]  We have been invaded, and everybody is being passed about it.
[02:54:13.997 --> 02:54:15.918]  We need moral men and women.
[02:54:16.613 --> 02:54:17.854]  To stand up for this nation.
[02:54:18.054 --> 02:54:20.836]  No, no, I absolutely agree with you.
[02:54:21.556 --> 02:54:23.357]  Let's quickly, Skunk, you've got 30 seconds.
[02:54:23.377 --> 02:54:24.578]  I've got to finish up here and go to Mike.
[02:54:25.194 --> 02:54:28.157]  All right, I just want to say thank you again for bringing this up.
[02:54:28.197 --> 02:54:35.102]  I remember you, as far as, as long as I've been listening to you, I've heard you speaking about the immigration problem developing all along the Texas border.
[02:54:35.503 --> 02:54:37.745]  Now it seems that now it's getting national attention.
[02:54:38.025 --> 02:54:43.650]  People countrywide are starting to get concerned and actually starting to motivate themselves to do something.
[02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:45.952]  And that's what the mainstream media are trying to spin it.
[02:54:45.992 --> 02:54:46.652]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:47.013 --> 02:54:48.174]  Last caller, Chris in Florida.
[02:54:48.194 --> 02:54:49.395]  You're on the air with Libby Moreno.
[02:54:49.415 --> 02:54:49.675]  Go ahead.
[02:54:51.497 --> 02:54:55.519]  Alex, I wanted to address the last caller in the supermarket incident.
[02:54:55.559 --> 02:55:06.045]  I just wanted to encourage him to tell the truth about what happened, actually to address the manager and tell him that he will not tolerate that kind of treatment by the cashiers.
[02:55:06.665 --> 02:55:15.710]  And I wanted to make the point that I'm not so afraid of an enemy that's not very well educated, non-welfare, and has a lot of welfare babies, because I see them on the bus.
[02:55:17.186 --> 02:55:23.410]  I'm afraid of an enemy that controls the welfare, controls the buses, controls the camps.
[02:55:24.091 --> 02:55:28.594]  And I was wondering, I've heard there's a Supreme Court case against internment camps.
[02:55:28.654 --> 02:55:29.254]  Are you aware of that?
[02:55:29.635 --> 02:55:32.176]  Yes, there's a lot of things that are happening.
[02:55:32.196 --> 02:55:34.318]  Japanese Americans are assuming a lot more is happening.
[02:55:34.578 --> 02:55:35.239]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:35.259 --> 02:55:37.941]  Libby Moreno, I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:55:38.181 --> 02:55:45.446]  And if you're still going to be in town on Monday, maybe I could have you in studio here in Austin because we can then videotape it and put it on the local TV show.
[02:55:46.229 --> 02:55:49.135]  Actually, I am going to leave Sunday.
[02:55:49.155 --> 02:55:54.186]  I have... They're doing... The 700 Club is doing a documentary on me.
[02:55:54.326 --> 02:55:54.967]  Oh, fantastic.
[02:55:55.268 --> 02:55:57.152]  They are going to a reckoning.
[02:55:57.797 --> 02:56:01.940]  And so I need to be back home by Sunday because we're going to go visit our church.
[02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:03.501]  Lupe, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:56:03.741 --> 02:56:05.002]  Well, thank you for having me.
[02:56:05.262 --> 02:56:05.843]  God bless.
[02:56:06.483 --> 02:56:07.564]  All right, I'm out of time.
[02:56:07.584 --> 02:56:12.688]  I shouldn't try cutting promos here live on the radio, but it's certainly real.
[02:56:13.208 --> 02:56:14.509]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:56:14.549 --> 02:56:20.013]  Be sure and join me coming up at noon today right here on KLBJ 590 AM.
[02:56:20.353 --> 02:56:21.554]  All right, God bless you all.
[02:56:23.413 --> 02:56:27.341]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[02:56:27.662 --> 02:56:28.444]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
