[00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:06.162]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:07.903]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:09.724]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:11.185]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:12.847]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:17.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.793]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:30.540]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.122]  It is the 13th day of July...
[00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:38.945]  Coming up in the second hour, 60 minutes from now, we're going to be joined
[00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:59.517]  By Kevin Barrett, and of course he is a doctor, he is a professor, and he was on Hannity & Combs a few nights ago, did a great job exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:05.900]  Many neocons are calling for him to be fired from his job or removed as a professor.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.443]  Dr. Bob Bowman last night was on Hannity & Combs and did a decent job.
[00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:12.404]  He wasn't as hardcore as I would have liked.
[00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:16.006]  We'll play both of those clips and analyze them and comment on them today.
[00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:33.259]  Then coming up later in the third hour, we have Connie Fogle joining us, and she heads up an organization in Canada that's fighting for their sovereignty, and they're dealing with the American Union situation.
[00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:39.581]  There have been several big new developments that Jerome Corsi and others have also written about, even in the mainstream media and human events.
[00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.782]  So we'll be covering the American Union in the third hour today.
[00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:54.224]  Of course, Israel has stepped up its military offensives now into two separate countries, regions in their area.
[00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:56.514]  In their area of the world.
[00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:58.315]  They have a long history.
[00:01:58.335 --> 00:01:59.855]  They're saying it's insane and wrong.
[00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.799]  We're good to go.
[00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:50.589]  No, they're just blowing up different governmental facilities.
[00:02:51.109 --> 00:03:07.375]  Bush and Merkel made clear at a joint news conference that they felt Israel's actions in seeking kidnapped soldiers and responding to Hezbollah rocket attacks were justified, but Russian foreign minister denounced both Israel's attacks on Lebanon and its operations against the Palestinian territories.
[00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:14.697]  This is a disproportionate response to what has happened, and both sides are going to drive each other into a tight corner that I think...
[00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:15.618]  I think?
[00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:36.044]  Intensifying reprisals after Hezbollah seized two Israeli soldiers and killed eight in cross-border attacks on Wednesday.
[00:03:36.404 --> 00:03:39.265]  The Israeli attacks have killed 52 Lebanese civilians.
[00:03:39.725 --> 00:03:51.768]  Disproportionate French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy called Israel's bombardment of Beirut airport a disproportionate act of war, saying there was a real risk of regional war.
[00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.069]  I agree.
[00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.030]  We are really seeing the kickoff, what could be the kickoff,
[00:03:57.597 --> 00:03:58.117]  We're good to go.
[00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:18.634]  We're good to go.
[00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:19.134]  I think?
[00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:45.441]  And then we'll shift gears to some of the police state developments here domestically.
[00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:57.069]  Also, Ken Lay's disgusting funeral, a mysterious death of a banker connected to Enron, while three other Britons are being extradited today for scams in and around the Bank of Scotland.
[00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.189]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:58.650]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.754]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.160]  We're good to go.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.622]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:26.882 --> 00:05:31.525]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:37.868]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.908 --> 00:05:39.749]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:42.312]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:45.756]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:56.268 --> 00:05:57.810]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.053]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:03.740]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.862]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.123 --> 00:06:11.286]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:12.547]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.847 --> 00:06:17.431]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:20.039]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:35.227]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:42.331]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:08.900]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.942]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:14.282 --> 00:07:21.845]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:29.127]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:30.748]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:34.709]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:42.011]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:07:49.133 --> 00:07:49.493]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:50.393]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:53.754]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.586 --> 00:08:18.229]  Welcome to this Thursday edition, 13th of July, 2006.
[00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:23.613]  Kevin Barrett, who is a director and founding member of Muslim-Jewish-Christian Alliance for 9-11 Truth.
[00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:24.974]  He's also a member of 9-11 Scholars.
[00:08:43.886 --> 00:08:44.467]  We're good to go.
[00:08:55.567 --> 00:09:07.554]  Second hour today and the third hour we're going to go north to Canada where a national organization has decided to make it their main focus to fight the formation of the American Union.
[00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:12.436]  It is big news in Canada all over their mainstream newspapers for the last three years.
[00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:17.359]  It's now gotten an even bigger boost with the public announcements of the Bush administration.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:27.674]  To set up the American Union and the resulting fallout in our national press as the American people begin to actually find out that this is really happening.
[00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:28.455]  So that's coming up.
[00:09:29.424 --> 00:09:34.449]  In the third hour today with Connie Fogle joining us from Canada.
[00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:45.281]  There have been several new big developments concerning the American Union as people begin to find out just how much control this new international body will have over the American people, the people of Canada and Mexico.
[00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:50.206]  It's a total transfer from the American people to these unelected regional governors.
[00:09:51.533 --> 00:09:53.294]  It's called tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:54.414]  It's called despotism.
[00:09:54.754 --> 00:09:59.216]  It's called dictatorship of the elite, the alpha maggots, over the people.
[00:09:59.256 --> 00:10:00.637]  They are elite in name only.
[00:10:00.657 --> 00:10:03.718]  They are elite in their wickedness and their corruption.
[00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:11.021]  Getting back to Israel, Israel is now in a two-front war, attacking multiple areas surrounding Israel.
[00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:20.905]  It is, of course, being decried by nations like Greece that are historically anti-Muslim, anti-Arab.
[00:10:22.563 --> 00:10:23.644]  We're good to go.
[00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:48.082]  Israel is imposing a blockade on Lebanon, and they have bombed their main airport.
[00:10:48.202 --> 00:10:50.324]  Israel is imposing a CN air blockade on Lebanon.
[00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:56.290]  A senior Israeli military official said Thursday, the official spoke after Israel aircraft bombed Beirut's international airport.
[00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:59.974]  He spoke on a condition of anonymity because he has not authorized to discuss military information.
[00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:05.203]  Well, we don't even need Israeli defense officials to tell us what they're doing.
[00:11:05.223 --> 00:11:07.066]  We can see the naval blockade.
[00:11:07.386 --> 00:11:09.210]  We can see the bombardment going on.
[00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.754]  We can see government buildings being blown up.
[00:11:12.315 --> 00:11:13.517]  That's a minor footnote.
[00:11:14.617 --> 00:11:16.399]  In these different reports.
[00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:18.641]  Speaking of Greece, this is out of the Jerusalem Post.
[00:11:19.022 --> 00:11:22.345]  Greece, Israel's using excessive pointless force.
[00:11:22.786 --> 00:11:28.111]  Greece on Thursday expressed serious concern over Israel's attacks in Lebanon and urged neighboring countries to show restraint.
[00:11:28.452 --> 00:11:31.335]  Government spokesman Evangelos N.
[00:11:32.344 --> 00:11:32.824]  Thank you.
[00:11:32.844 --> 00:11:33.485]  Thank you.
[00:11:49.413 --> 00:11:54.095]  Their minister told the Israelis it is vital to stop the situation worsening.
[00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:56.837]  Hezbollah must immediately release the soldiers taken hostage.
[00:11:57.077 --> 00:12:05.100]  He said at the same time, Greece calls on the government of Israel to avoid the use of excessive pointless force, which cannot provide a solution to the problem.
[00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:11.583]  Greece has traditionally close ties with Arab countries, but has also recently improved relations with Israel.
[00:12:12.044 --> 00:12:15.545]  And that's kind of a deceptive little headline here out of the Jerusalem Post.
[00:12:15.805 --> 00:12:17.126]  Greece is well known for
[00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:17.887]  We're good to go.
[00:12:17.907 --> 00:12:18.609]  We're good to go.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.841]  Olmert is in trouble in a big sexual harassment case.
[00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:35.182]  Members of his cabinet are getting in trouble for bribes.
[00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:39.263]  Tony Blair's chief fundraiser has now been arrested.
[00:12:39.763 --> 00:12:42.824]  Bush is in trouble on 100 plus different fronts.
[00:12:43.264 --> 00:12:47.685]  They've said they want to escalate a war in the Middle East and invade Syria and Iran.
[00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:51.247]  The path that Israel is now taking is directly into Syria.
[00:12:51.507 --> 00:12:56.128]  They've been trying to blame Syria and claiming that Syria controls Hezbollah.
[00:12:56.668 --> 00:12:57.449]  We're good to go.
[00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:37.483]  And the Israelis have always sought to foment strife and warfare in the region as a pretext to continue the military government of Israel, the control of the press and the oppression of the Israeli people themselves.
[00:13:37.963 --> 00:13:40.946]  And UPI has also reported, as well as the Jerusalem Post,
[00:13:41.406 --> 00:13:57.242]  Going back to 2002, that Israel has been caught, Shembet has been caught internally creating fake Al-Qaeda terror groups who carry out bombings and shootings to then be blamed on the Palestinians and other neighbors as a pretext to then militarily attack them.
[00:13:57.523 --> 00:14:03.309]  And I don't want the neocons listening, the neocon brainwashed zombie followers to hiss and say I'm making this up.
[00:14:03.849 --> 00:14:07.793]  Many of you are ignorant out there that support this administration and what Israel's doing.
[00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:19.523]  If you'll simply go research, even the Jewish newspapers, the Israeli newspapers over there, admit that much of the terrorism caught red-handed in the region is being carried out by Israel.
[00:14:21.244 --> 00:14:22.926]  Now, that is just a fact.
[00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:27.830]  Israel staged the USS Liberty event in collusion with our own government.
[00:14:28.813 --> 00:14:29.073]  In 1967.
[00:14:29.293 --> 00:14:31.194]  That is on the record.
[00:14:31.494 --> 00:14:32.694]  Try to blame it on Egypt.
[00:14:33.174 --> 00:14:44.557]  They have always wanted to have a greater Israel that goes into areas of Iraq, large sections of Syria, and this is what they're attempting to do right now.
[00:14:46.377 --> 00:14:47.458]  They want an empire.
[00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:48.038]  The U.S.
[00:14:48.058 --> 00:14:49.038]  wants an empire.
[00:14:49.358 --> 00:14:51.999]  It's Britain, the U.S., and Israel allied together.
[00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:52.999]  This is not the...
[00:14:54.318 --> 00:14:59.179]  Interest of the American people, the interest of Israel, the interest of the British people.
[00:14:59.219 --> 00:15:03.561]  This is the interest of elites that want that oil, that want control of that region.
[00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:12.163]  And we have Israeli, U.S., and British-owned policy reports going back in the early 80s through the late 90s where they lay out this plan.
[00:15:12.819 --> 00:15:18.363]  For Balkanized, fractured Arab countries, broken depending on which nation, from two to six parts.
[00:15:18.823 --> 00:15:20.244]  Iraq they want in three or four parts.
[00:15:20.284 --> 00:15:21.545]  Saudi Arabia in three parts.
[00:15:21.945 --> 00:15:23.766]  They talk about putting Syria in three parts.
[00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:26.468]  Breaking Lebanon into a couple more parts.
[00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:29.911]  This is what the elites have been doing for the last hundred years.
[00:15:30.251 --> 00:15:33.133]  The British attempted to do this and were successful a hundred years ago.
[00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.715]  Starting a hundred years ago through to about 80 years ago.
[00:15:37.135 --> 00:15:38.196]  It's an ongoing program.
[00:15:38.216 --> 00:15:40.097]  They overthrew the elected government of Iran in 1953.
[00:15:41.458 --> 00:15:43.059]  Using stage terror yet again.
[00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:45.780]  That was the British, MI6, and the CIA.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.941]  That's all declassified.
[00:15:49.062 --> 00:15:52.163]  And we cover this in my film Terror Storm, by the way.
[00:15:53.257 --> 00:16:02.381]  So President Bush said today that Israel has the right to defend itself as it launched fresh attacks on Lebanon after the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers.
[00:16:03.222 --> 00:16:04.982]  Israeli soldiers are getting captured all the time.
[00:16:05.002 --> 00:16:05.583]  This is a war.
[00:16:06.083 --> 00:16:11.265]  Thousands and thousands of Palestinians and Lebanese and others get captured every year by the Israelis.
[00:16:11.325 --> 00:16:12.186]  This is a war.
[00:16:12.706 --> 00:16:15.567]  And again, I'm not defending the actions of some of the Arabs over there.
[00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:18.969]  The point is, this is an ancient war.
[00:16:20.298 --> 00:16:37.031]  That has flared up big time since Israel took over in the late 1940s, early 1950s because the globalists believe they get order out of chaos and Israel clearly is behind many of the provocations that have caused escalation.
[00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:39.937]  We're good to go.
[00:16:39.957 --> 00:16:40.417]  We're good to go.
[00:17:00.257 --> 00:17:03.658]  Behind, and actually maybe in some cases, there's a mix in there.
[00:17:03.678 --> 00:17:12.060]  There are some real Arab fighters, there are some real people launching military strikes on Israel in low-intensity conflict that Israel then deems as terrorism.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.881]  So again, however you cut this, this is war.
[00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:25.944]  This is tribal, sectarian war between cousins, and any time the Arabs fight, or any time the Arabs attack, it is called terrorism.
[00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:37.507]  When the Israelis fire a Hellfire missile into a school or into a hospital or into a mosque or into a government building and kill sometimes hundreds at a pop, it is called military strikes.
[00:17:38.047 --> 00:17:49.518]  But when a Palestinian straps five pounds of explosives to their belly and blows up a bus and kills 20-something people, it's called terrorism.
[00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:51.080]  Well, war itself is terror.
[00:17:52.518 --> 00:17:52.998]  We're good to go.
[00:17:53.018 --> 00:17:53.159]  I think?
[00:18:16.716 --> 00:18:23.382]  Bush's comments came during a joint news conference with German Chancellor Merkel as Israeli intensified attacks in Lebanon.
[00:18:24.543 --> 00:18:26.205]  So they're bombing Palestine, Lebanon.
[00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:27.803]  They've got tanks.
[00:18:27.843 --> 00:18:32.664]  They've got the big howitzers, the big guns out there just blowing things to kingdom come.
[00:18:32.684 --> 00:18:34.925]  They've got fighter bombers dropping bombs.
[00:18:34.945 --> 00:18:36.465]  They're blowing up airports.
[00:18:36.485 --> 00:18:38.426]  They're blowing up government buildings.
[00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:42.687]  And it is just absolutely disgusting.
[00:18:42.847 --> 00:18:46.708]  It is a travesty to see this type of thing happening.
[00:18:49.449 --> 00:18:54.070]  Now, I want to shift gears before...
[00:18:55.205 --> 00:19:01.369]  We run out of time here, and our guest joins us coming up in about 40 minutes and get into some other news.
[00:19:01.429 --> 00:19:03.030]  I mentioned this, but let's detail it.
[00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:10.375]  This leads into Ken Lay and the new mysterious death of one of the bankers involved with Ken Lay, who was about to be indicted.
[00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:19.301]  Three of his cohorts are being extradited to the United States today for Enron connections and their sellout of energy companies to Enron.
[00:19:19.681 --> 00:19:25.125]  The fellow that the evidence looks like he was murdered, the police are saying they don't know a day into it.
[00:19:26.226 --> 00:19:27.386]  It's down in the London Park.
[00:19:28.326 --> 00:19:32.588]  But before we get into that, Blair Chief Fundraiser arrested by police.
[00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:43.013]  Lord Levy, the Chief Fundraiser for Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair's Labour Party, has been arrested by police, probing allegations that state awards have been given in return for cash.
[00:19:43.374 --> 00:19:52.738]  The Labour Party has come under pressure after it was said it received more than $40 million on loans for 12 businessmen, some of whom were nominated for seats in Britain's unelected Upper House of Parliament.
[00:19:53.199 --> 00:19:56.789]  We'll be right back with details of the Enron murders.
[00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:58.555]  That's what it clearly is when we get back.
[00:20:01.457 --> 00:20:08.302]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:14.147]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[00:20:14.467 --> 00:20:21.032]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[00:20:21.252 --> 00:20:28.017]  This patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[00:20:28.297 --> 00:20:37.345]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[00:20:37.565 --> 00:20:41.068]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:44.831]  Its many self-sufficient and high-security features will amaze you.
[00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:52.437]  With nuclear World War III looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey ready for a new owner.
[00:20:52.757 --> 00:20:56.899]  For more information, visit www.UltimateSecureHome.com.
[00:20:57.099 --> 00:21:00.781]  That's www.UltimateSecureHome.com.
[00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:04.402]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.822 --> 00:21:10.305]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.865 --> 00:21:11.365]  That's right.
[00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:14.347]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:15.367 --> 00:21:21.450]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:22.003 --> 00:21:29.709]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:34.953]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.615 --> 00:21:40.637]  If you'd like to take a look at gold-free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.438 --> 00:21:45.559]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.939 --> 00:21:46.180]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.140]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:48.521]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:49.081]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.363 --> 00:22:02.964]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:03.344 --> 00:22:09.088]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:14.472]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:22:14.812 --> 00:22:24.078]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:22:24.438 --> 00:22:29.421]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:33.704]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:22:33.924 --> 00:22:38.707]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:44.971]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:51.519]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:52.540]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.521]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.921]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails.
[00:23:03.061 --> 00:23:07.324]  I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:23:07.744 --> 00:23:10.406]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:10.566 --> 00:23:13.368]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem.
[00:23:13.548 --> 00:23:15.169]  Yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:20.153]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris so toenails look clear.
[00:23:20.353 --> 00:23:25.076]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:23:25.296 --> 00:23:27.978]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:28.198 --> 00:23:31.100]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:33.381]  Looking for profit?
[00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:34.842]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:38.383]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offered both.
[00:23:38.423 --> 00:23:46.007]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:49.588]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:23:49.828 --> 00:23:51.309]  Secure your position today.
[00:23:51.629 --> 00:23:52.850]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.150]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:07.182 --> 00:24:09.924]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.344 --> 00:24:18.169]  Israel's little escalation of the conflict that's been ongoing.
[00:24:18.189 --> 00:24:21.632]  They're just suddenly making a big deal out of daily occurrences.
[00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:28.712]  Is that oil prices are at all-time highs, back over $76 a barrel.
[00:24:29.232 --> 00:24:35.794]  Speaking of oil and energy manipulation, we'll get into the latest Enron bankers and whistleblowers dying.
[00:24:35.854 --> 00:24:36.794]  Are they being murdered?
[00:24:36.814 --> 00:24:39.034]  I think the evidence is clearly yes.
[00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:46.176]  But before we do that, as you know, I have very few sponsors because I'm choosing.
[00:24:46.696 --> 00:24:50.397]  I want an American company with American products made by and for Americans.
[00:24:51.053 --> 00:24:57.178]  I have chosen the Calvin Pure Soap Company, a 60-year-old family-owned and operated soap manufacturer in Oakland, California.
[00:24:57.839 --> 00:25:06.106]  I and my wife and staff are currently using these all-natural, earth-friendly, triple-concentrated pure soaps for bathing, shampooing, laundry, and dishes.
[00:25:06.466 --> 00:25:08.007]  And I have to tell you, they are the best.
[00:25:08.147 --> 00:25:09.168]  I mean the very best.
[00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:13.012]  We have never seen better, bar none.
[00:25:13.872 --> 00:25:14.613]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:29.971]  You can continue to use all those detergents you are buying now and paying 20% of your grocery bill on average for cleaners that I can prove with statistical evidence are very, very toxic and dangerous.
[00:25:30.832 --> 00:25:33.754]  Most likely you don't even know what you are paying.
[00:25:33.834 --> 00:25:37.297]  Have you noticed that there are no prices on anything but barcodes?
[00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:43.458]  As an example, if you spend $100 a week at the market, $20 goes for cleaning chemicals.
[00:25:43.778 --> 00:25:46.599]  That's over $1,000 a year going down the drain.
[00:25:46.939 --> 00:25:49.441]  Why not put your money up the drain for a change?
[00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:55.664]  By one simple toll-free call, you can get a one-year supply of soap for $125 plus $35 to $45 shipping.
[00:25:55.684 --> 00:25:58.565]  At about $325 a week for all your bath, hair, laundry, and dishes, it's the best bargain available
[00:26:06.778 --> 00:26:09.620]  For these fantastic cleaning products in the United States.
[00:26:10.141 --> 00:26:12.563]  This is an Alex Jones and GCN exclusives.
[00:26:13.063 --> 00:26:17.427]  See it on the website, 5starsoap.com, or call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:26:19.088 --> 00:26:22.591]  You say you want to try it first and order?
[00:26:22.871 --> 00:26:28.375]  Their six-pound sampler, one-month supply of four products for $14.
[00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:30.737]  Another great bargain.
[00:26:32.439 --> 00:26:33.219]  And it goes on.
[00:26:33.239 --> 00:26:36.222]  Again, this little ad I've written up just with my thoughts here.
[00:26:37.917 --> 00:26:49.139]  It is a guaranteed way to save money, cutting down from 20% of your weekly grocery bill to 3% and getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:26:49.499 --> 00:26:52.740]  Triple concentrated, earth-friendly, and all-American.
[00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.240]  This is a super good deal.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.280]  Give them a call at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:55.581]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[00:26:55.601 --> 00:26:56.321]  Or when you call them...
[00:27:03.802 --> 00:27:04.942]  Tell them you want a free catalog.
[00:27:04.962 --> 00:27:06.923]  You can also do that.
[00:27:06.943 --> 00:27:07.483]  1-800-340-7091.
[00:27:07.623 --> 00:27:25.248]  Get the $14 sampler tote bag, or get the year's supply, or get a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091, or calbinpuresoap.com, or fivestarsoap.com, or there's a banner on the left-hand side of infowars.com.
[00:27:25.308 --> 00:27:26.909]  No petrochemicals in there, by the way.
[00:27:26.949 --> 00:27:27.729]  It's all natural.
[00:27:28.289 --> 00:27:35.054]  It's organic on top of that, and they have all their organic certification certificates, scans of them there on the website for you to check it out for yourself.
[00:27:35.434 --> 00:27:40.438]  So it's made in America, it's family-owned, and you save 80% off supermarket prices.
[00:27:40.718 --> 00:27:41.559]  Give them a call right now.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.380]  All right!
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.343]  Oh my gosh, there is just so much here, so much happening.
[00:27:48.183 --> 00:27:48.604]  I'm almost...
[00:27:49.628 --> 00:27:53.889]  Floundering with all of this news here in front of me.
[00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:56.530]  Let me just read excerpts of the article by Steve Watson.
[00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.550]  We'll cover more of this after the break that's coming up in the long segment.
[00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:03.011]  Are Enron bankers witnesses being murdered?
[00:28:03.291 --> 00:28:16.554]  With the latest revelation that a body discovered in northeast London is that of a banker intimately connected with the Enron fraud case, one has to begin to ask, why are so many unexplained deaths linked to this case?
[00:28:17.469 --> 00:28:28.614]  And even, I would add, mainstream newspapers and publications and the BBC and others are asking if this is murder, too, and asking if this is political hits in an attempted cover-up.
[00:28:28.654 --> 00:28:31.315]  I mean, this is really breaking big time.
[00:28:31.716 --> 00:28:39.479]  The BBC is reporting that London police are treating the death of Neil Colbeck, who worked for the Royal Bank of Scotland until 2004, as unexplained.
[00:28:39.819 --> 00:28:42.661]  Colbeck had been interviewed by the FBI's potential witness.
[00:28:42.981 --> 00:28:45.502]  The fraud case centers on a NatWest...
[00:28:45.902 --> 00:28:46.722]  We're good to go.
[00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:01.861]  And it continues.
[00:29:02.542 --> 00:29:06.804]  Is this becoming a case of too many unexplained deaths, spoiling a good cover-up?
[00:29:07.824 --> 00:29:17.989]  In 2002, Enron Vice Chairman Jay Clifford Baxter was found shot to death in his Mercedes Benz in the early hours of Friday morning, January 25th, near his home in Sugar Land, Texas.
[00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:29.274]  The death was officially reported as a suicide, yet local justice of the peace, Jim Richard, initially declared that Baxter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but then reversed himself, citing the intense public interest in the death.
[00:29:30.174 --> 00:29:37.998]  There were many suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, including the moving of evidence and the tampering of the body, prior to the immediate investigation of the scene.
[00:29:38.479 --> 00:29:47.384]  CBS reported he'd been shot with a rat shot, which is what assassins use because it covers up any type of bullet forensics.
[00:29:47.404 --> 00:29:48.004]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.586 --> 00:29:52.507]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.987 --> 00:29:54.588]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.508 --> 00:29:58.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.846 --> 00:31:03.467]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.607 --> 00:31:07.710]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.712]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.812 --> 00:31:17.516]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.716 --> 00:31:20.698]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.918 --> 00:31:23.300]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.143]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:28.323 --> 00:31:42.906]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:43.046 --> 00:31:49.727]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:53.469]  888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:54.469]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:59.693]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:01.675 --> 00:32:06.098]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:11.942]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[00:32:12.303 --> 00:32:17.226]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[00:32:17.487 --> 00:32:21.970]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:22.831]  We're good to go.
[00:32:22.911 --> 00:32:23.071]  I think?
[00:32:43.391 --> 00:32:46.092]  One of the most disgusting displays of neocon arrogance
[00:33:13.912 --> 00:33:19.655]  Was displayed yesterday at Ken Lay's funeral that Bush and others attended.
[00:33:19.675 --> 00:33:21.075]  This convicted criminal.
[00:33:23.977 --> 00:33:26.498]  They compared him to Jesus, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:26.718 --> 00:33:28.099]  That's how arrogant they are.
[00:33:28.319 --> 00:33:29.459]  Jesus Christ.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.081]  That is unbelievable.
[00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:34.502]  This arch criminal.
[00:33:35.582 --> 00:33:43.386]  So we'll be going over that and individuals that could expose Enron who have been involved in the corruption are dropping dead like flies.
[00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:46.932]  And, of course, now it's even on national British television.
[00:33:46.952 --> 00:33:49.433]  The majority of the Brits and even members of Parliament are going public.
[00:33:49.493 --> 00:33:52.334]  Police are going public that Dr. David Kelly was murdered.
[00:33:52.354 --> 00:33:54.615]  It's the same thing with Vince Foster.
[00:33:54.655 --> 00:33:55.295]  They kill you.
[00:33:56.015 --> 00:33:57.356]  It's obvious you were murdered.
[00:33:57.456 --> 00:33:58.676]  There's no blood at the scene.
[00:33:58.976 --> 00:34:03.978]  They drag you out to a park and throw you there with carpet fibers all over you, killed in some house.
[00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:06.571]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:07.432]  It's the same M.O.
[00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:14.201]  I mean, if I'm ever found dead in a park with a gunshot wound in my head, please, ladies and gentlemen, I will never commit suicide.
[00:34:14.261 --> 00:34:15.042]  I love life.
[00:34:15.974 --> 00:34:18.476]  And even Baxter was saying, I'm not going to commit suicide.
[00:34:18.516 --> 00:34:19.316]  I need a bodyguard.
[00:34:19.356 --> 00:34:20.137]  I'm getting threats.
[00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:22.558]  They blow his head off with the rat shot.
[00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:25.820]  The mafia used to use a .22, but even that has some rifling.
[00:34:27.041 --> 00:34:27.661]  Let's be technical.
[00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:32.945]  There's not rifling on it, but there are grooves in the barrel that can be signatured forensically to the gun.
[00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:34.646]  Not with a rat shot, folks.
[00:34:34.686 --> 00:34:41.410]  You shoot somebody in the head with a rat shot at point-blank range, just the gas alone is going to shoot into your brain and scramble your gray matter.
[00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:45.400]  But you have those little BBs.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.102]  They shoot right through the skull and absolutely make mincemeat out of your brain tissue.
[00:34:52.002 --> 00:34:56.104]  But, again, it's like Gary Webb's writing a new book about CIA drug dealing.
[00:34:56.124 --> 00:35:00.326]  He'd gotten all the proof to totally vindicate himself from Dark Alliance.
[00:35:00.906 --> 00:35:05.348]  And he starts telling people he's getting threats, and he shoots himself twice in the head.
[00:35:05.548 --> 00:35:11.731]  And the police go, that's quite normal to blow your whole jaw off and then shoot yourself in the head again.
[00:35:13.385 --> 00:35:15.667]  So, again, I'm digressing.
[00:35:15.727 --> 00:35:18.289]  I'm going to get into Enron in full detail.
[00:35:18.389 --> 00:35:30.319]  The funeral, the latest clear murder there in England of one of the minions involved in all of this who looked like he might have flipped over on his side and might have gone public.
[00:35:32.261 --> 00:35:32.841]  No, no.
[00:35:34.543 --> 00:35:35.904]  But before we do that,
[00:35:36.821 --> 00:35:37.942]  I wanted to get her up today.
[00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:39.963]  Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:48.730]  They are the national manufacturer, made in America, just like Calvin Trousseau, made in America, the highest quality, gravity-fed water filtration systems out there, bar none.
[00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:55.715]  I mean, I was buying these things seven, eight years ago, back when they were the national distributor of the British Berkey, and they still are.
[00:35:55.735 --> 00:35:56.396]  You get those, too.
[00:35:56.716 --> 00:35:57.497]  And I did research.
[00:35:57.537 --> 00:35:59.038]  It was the best filter you could get for the price.
[00:35:59.751 --> 00:36:02.472]  You can buy Indian and Chinese knockoffs that cost even more.
[00:36:02.852 --> 00:36:04.272]  You get a distributor price.
[00:36:04.312 --> 00:36:06.472]  You get a wholesale price when you buy just one of these.
[00:36:06.492 --> 00:36:09.973]  So you get the price that distributors are getting when they buy 20, 30 of them.
[00:36:10.533 --> 00:36:13.174]  And it's made in America, and it's what I use, what we use in the office.
[00:36:13.774 --> 00:36:19.415]  And Debbie just handles the radio interviews for this national manufacturer and distributor.
[00:36:19.435 --> 00:36:20.075]  So they have the British.
[00:36:20.095 --> 00:36:20.875]  They have the American.
[00:36:21.156 --> 00:36:27.217]  They have whatever you want, but we believe in the scientific test done by the University of New Orleans.
[00:36:28.866 --> 00:36:31.807]  To be the best, and Debbie Morrow joins us.
[00:36:31.847 --> 00:36:32.807]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:33.607]  Hi, Alex.
[00:36:33.707 --> 00:36:34.948]  Thank you for having me.
[00:36:35.268 --> 00:36:35.848]  You bet.
[00:36:35.888 --> 00:36:45.090]  Tell us about what the Big Berkey does, some of the different models you have, including the Travel Berkey, and about some of the free gifts people get, and encourage folks to give you a call.
[00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.071]  Hi there.
[00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:46.991]  Thanks.
[00:36:47.651 --> 00:36:55.253]  Well, the Berkey water filters are gravity water filters that actually purify the water with the Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:36:55.987 --> 00:37:03.972]  They take the pathogenic bacteria, cyst sediment, inorganic compounds, and the VOCs to a non-detectable level.
[00:37:03.992 --> 00:37:13.738]  And according to the EPA, you know, there are all these different allowable substances that they do allow in the water.
[00:37:13.758 --> 00:37:16.420]  And we want to get that out.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.720]  You don't want to drink it.
[00:37:17.901 --> 00:37:20.642]  You know, whether it's allowable or not, it's not good for your health.
[00:37:21.143 --> 00:37:23.444]  And the new Black Berkey purification elements
[00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:37.671]  Actually set a new standard in the water filter industry for purification because it's the only gravity filter out there that we're aware of that takes the bacteria and things out to a non-detectable level.
[00:37:39.512 --> 00:37:48.360]  We are offering them with a free Alex Jones special gift so that, you know, encourage people to, you know, want to call in and get them now.
[00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:49.501]  We are...
[00:37:50.626 --> 00:38:00.952]  Not doing the Berkey Sport bottles temporarily because we have run short on them, and so we are offering the LED flashlights or KDF shower filters, different items.
[00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:05.494]  When people call in, I'll be glad to go over the items with them.
[00:38:05.994 --> 00:38:10.237]  Just say they're an Alex Jones listener, and I can be reached toll-free at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:10.277 --> 00:38:12.358]  Also, our website is berkeywater.com,
[00:38:18.479 --> 00:38:23.645]  Spelled D-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R dot com.
[00:38:24.065 --> 00:38:35.798]  And if you do go to the website to order, be absolutely sure that you put that you're an Alex Jones listener in the comments so we can go ahead and include a free gift on that, as well as help support your airtime.
[00:38:36.542 --> 00:38:37.103]  That's right.
[00:38:37.383 --> 00:38:49.657]  For those that don't know, we don't pay for airtime except on Global Shortwave as an international service, really, because Shortwave doesn't really help us pay for the airtime.
[00:38:49.717 --> 00:38:53.842]  We do it because we get letters and emails from all over the planet saying,
[00:38:54.122 --> 00:38:55.063]  I think we're good to go.
[00:39:14.236 --> 00:39:16.839]  And it's the best filtration system out there that we've found.
[00:39:17.199 --> 00:39:20.362]  So give Debbie a call, 1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:20.783 --> 00:39:22.825]  Or go to Infowars.com.
[00:39:22.865 --> 00:39:29.131]  You can order it off the Secure Online shopping cart there or link over on the banner on the left-hand side to BerkeyWater.com.
[00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:30.092]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[00:39:30.112 --> 00:39:31.032]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:31.253 --> 00:39:31.793]  Take care.
[00:39:32.073 --> 00:39:33.575]  Have a great weekend coming up.
[00:39:33.775 --> 00:39:34.436]  Thanks, you too.
[00:39:34.516 --> 00:39:34.816]  Bye-bye.
[00:39:35.136 --> 00:39:36.077]  Folks, give her the call.
[00:39:36.117 --> 00:39:37.038]  Here's the number, 1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.961]  The water's full of poison.
[00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:49.548]  I mean, you think Bayer would knowingly for a decade have AIDS virus in their factor VIII for the hemophiliacs, hundreds of thousands conservatively dying from it?
[00:39:50.969 --> 00:39:51.870]  It's upwards of a million.
[00:39:52.529 --> 00:39:57.793]  From Australia to the UK to the US, and you think the same people running our government aren't putting poison in the water?
[00:39:57.873 --> 00:40:01.355]  It's admitted, and I don't want to say it's a tasteless death.
[00:40:01.415 --> 00:40:05.438]  I mean, you can taste the garbage in the water, and I don't know why people are drinking it.
[00:40:05.478 --> 00:40:12.023]  It's like the Romans, I guess, didn't know that lead-lined pots for their wine and water were bad, but we do know.
[00:40:12.323 --> 00:40:20.869]  We do know herbicide and pesticide and all this stuff is bad, and we need to immediately stop drinking the poisonous water, especially your children.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.542]  So give her a call, 888-803-4438, or berkywater.com, or infowars.com.
[00:40:26.662 --> 00:40:26.982]  All right.
[00:40:27.502 --> 00:40:32.885]  We'll take calls after I get into this news on Enron, and there's multiple facets to this.
[00:40:32.905 --> 00:40:33.745]  At 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:37.127]  But just running through the news and finishing up, are Enron bankers' witnesses being murdered?
[00:40:48.604 --> 00:40:49.284]  Is the question.
[00:40:49.304 --> 00:40:51.766]  And here's the BBC headline on this.
[00:40:51.886 --> 00:40:53.867]  Enron witness found dead in park.
[00:40:54.527 --> 00:40:57.809]  And the police still are... And this is the same MO every time for a day or two.
[00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:59.630]  They'll say, oh, it's unexplained.
[00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:00.610]  We don't know how they died.
[00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:05.333]  They won't tell you while they're busy telling the first detectives to get there what the official story is.
[00:41:05.413 --> 00:41:15.178]  And months later, detectives and others will go public like they have with Dr. David Kelly, who was found a few years ago dead in a park with his wrist slit, no blood at the scene, with two undigested...
[00:41:15.658 --> 00:41:16.338]  We're good to go.
[00:41:39.347 --> 00:41:46.750]  And showing they've been crammed down his throat after he died, or right as he was dying, and there's no blood, so he clearly didn't bleed to death.
[00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:52.892]  But that's okay, and five guys in black uniforms run away, but it's suicide.
[00:41:53.536 --> 00:41:59.782]  Then he told an American colleague and a British colleague the week before, I've been told to shut up, quote, or I'm going to be found dead in the woods.
[00:42:00.262 --> 00:42:04.767]  And then he's found dead in the woods with five men running away in black outfits.
[00:42:06.088 --> 00:42:07.829]  I mean, just come on, folks.
[00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:08.670]  Come on.
[00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.853]  And you go back to Vince Foster, it's even more ridiculous.
[00:42:12.294 --> 00:42:12.414]  It's...
[00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:20.137]  We look at the case of Jay Clifford Baxter, Enron Vice Chairman, says, I've been threatened, I'm not going to commit suicide, I need a bodyguard.
[00:42:20.177 --> 00:42:32.310]  He tells the police and friends this, and then he's found drug out of his house, clearly in his underwear, a few blocks from his house, dead in a car, shot in the brain, with rat shot at point-blank range, which the mafia hitmen use.
[00:42:33.692 --> 00:42:35.554]  Because there's no rifling, it's a bunch of BBs.
[00:42:36.872 --> 00:42:44.576]  Again, it barely kills a rat from 15 feet away, but you shoot somebody at point-blank range, it's more devastating than a slug, than a full metal jacket, than a hollow point.
[00:42:45.597 --> 00:42:46.797]  It's about as deadly as it gets.
[00:42:46.817 --> 00:42:49.459]  Like a sheer safety slug that the air marshals use.
[00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:54.302]  You shoot somebody with that, it goes in and just turns you into jelly.
[00:42:55.422 --> 00:42:55.882]  Splatter.
[00:42:56.043 --> 00:42:57.003]  I don't want to get into details.
[00:42:57.663 --> 00:43:02.346]  I've shot a lot of different things, you know, hunting and a lot of target practice back when I had time and shot...
[00:43:03.089 --> 00:43:12.291]  You know, there's many different things, from wet phone books to old cars, and I know what bullets do, and I know what Ratshot does, and I've read that it's used by... I already said that five times.
[00:43:12.311 --> 00:43:13.251]  You know it's used by the mafia.
[00:43:14.132 --> 00:43:14.832]  You can look that up.
[00:43:16.312 --> 00:43:17.352]  So, that happens.
[00:43:17.532 --> 00:43:21.093]  CBS also reported that experts found, again, several things highly unusual.
[00:43:21.133 --> 00:43:24.954]  First, the particular ammunition, not regular bullets, but something called Ratshot bullets.
[00:43:25.902 --> 00:43:28.264]  Rat shot is a type of ammunition that cannot be easily traced.
[00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:29.726]  Back to the weapon that fired it.
[00:43:29.766 --> 00:43:31.387]  It is usually specifically fired at snakes.
[00:43:31.407 --> 00:43:34.050]  Small pest is not found readily.
[00:43:35.271 --> 00:43:35.671]  It goes on.
[00:43:35.731 --> 00:43:45.540]  Furthermore, according to the New York Times, an unnamed associate added that Baxter was talking about perhaps needing a bodyguard just days before his attack.
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.442]  That's from CBS.
[00:43:47.882 --> 00:43:49.003]  Again, CBS is wrong.
[00:43:49.724 --> 00:43:50.985]  Rat shot is found readily.
[00:43:51.025 --> 00:43:51.706]  It's in every major...
[00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:53.491]  Firearms ammunition supplier.
[00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:54.672]  You can buy it at Walmart or anywhere.
[00:43:55.092 --> 00:43:57.213]  The case remained open for months after his death.
[00:43:57.633 --> 00:44:04.317]  Why would a very successful businessman one day be talking about needing someone to guard his life, and then the next day decide to end it?
[00:44:04.718 --> 00:44:18.006]  Enron Vice Chairman Sharon Watkins, who warned top company officials that the energy trading giant might implode in a wave of accounting scandals, said she feared for her own life during the crisis that culminated in Enron's filing for bankruptcy.
[00:44:19.907 --> 00:44:25.111]  Then, of course, there is the timely death by heart attack, we're told, of Enron founder Ken Lay earlier this month.
[00:44:25.632 --> 00:44:29.154]  Lay was facing a lengthy jail sentence for conspiracy and fraud.
[00:44:29.194 --> 00:44:31.837]  His death has erupted a firestorm of rumors.
[00:44:31.897 --> 00:44:34.999]  Even the Miami Herald is questioning whether Lay has faked his own death.
[00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:39.723]  Some have intimated that Lay's death, whether it be natural, faked, or terminated...
[00:44:40.725 --> 00:44:43.626]  Why would this individual, convicted of all these felonies, what was it, six counts?
[00:44:43.646 --> 00:44:46.928]  Five counts of conspiracy and one count of something else.
[00:44:46.988 --> 00:44:50.229]  Why would they let him wait months and months for sentencing at his ski lodge?
[00:45:10.425 --> 00:45:11.005]  At Aspen.
[00:45:11.025 --> 00:45:17.107]  And then a week after he dies, Colin Powell's having dinner with the Clintons and collapses and has to go to the very same hospital.
[00:45:17.387 --> 00:45:18.927]  A lot of weird stuff going on in Denmark.
[00:45:20.567 --> 00:45:27.489]  Other Enron executives said witnesses involved in the case have gone on record saying they are scared to death of being intimately caught up in the case or killed.
[00:45:29.449 --> 00:45:31.110]  So it goes on and on.
[00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.370]  Now...
[00:45:32.293 --> 00:45:42.960]  We go from that and the mysterious death in England to these three individuals tied up with selling in a big scam, selling off Enron Control Company's divisions in England.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.401]  They're being extradited right now.
[00:45:44.421 --> 00:45:47.843]  They've been told they've been put on an airplane to be flown to D.C.
[00:45:49.465 --> 00:45:52.767]  where they've been indicted for scams with Enron.
[00:45:54.228 --> 00:45:57.490]  One of the people involved in testifying about this has been questioned by the FBI again.
[00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:58.511]  He's found dead.
[00:45:58.991 --> 00:46:01.793]  Meanwhile, we move into the ultra-bizarro
[00:46:02.874 --> 00:46:07.536]  World of Ken Lay being compared to Martin Luther King and Jesus.
[00:46:08.296 --> 00:46:10.697]  Ken Lay's memorial attracts power elite.
[00:46:11.197 --> 00:46:12.078]  George H.W.
[00:46:12.118 --> 00:46:21.381]  Bush, James Baker, among attendees at Pack Church for the Enron founder, the reverend compared fallen energy titan to Jesus.
[00:46:23.662 --> 00:46:26.563]  So that's the CNN Money headline and sub-headline.
[00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:32.852]  Reuters, Houston's political and business leaders, including former President George H.W.
[00:46:32.892 --> 00:46:33.113]  Bush.
[00:46:33.815 --> 00:46:39.198]  Turned out for Ken Lay's memorial service yesterday, less than a week after the Enron founder's sudden death.
[00:46:39.658 --> 00:46:50.164]  Friends and family lauded as a devout Christian and a family leader the man who built Enron into an international energy powerhouse before its collapse and the biggest corporate scandal of its time.
[00:46:50.704 --> 00:47:01.930]  Lay's stepson, David Harold, told the merely fool First Methodist Church that Lay was wrongly convicted and he was angry about the portrayals of his stepfather in the media.
[00:47:02.828 --> 00:47:11.888]  He did have a strong faith in God and I know he's in heaven and I'm glad he's not in a position anymore to be whipped by his enemy, Harold said.
[00:47:11.908 --> 00:47:12.870]  Who's the enemy?
[00:47:13.743 --> 00:47:21.108]  Thousands of Enron employees had their pensions stolen, or the millions of stockholders who were robbed as you transferred it all to offshore accounts.
[00:47:21.648 --> 00:47:24.190]  Enron, of course, was a big money laundering, drug dealing operation.
[00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.771]  It was involved in so much organized crime.
[00:47:26.151 --> 00:47:38.759]  Lay, who was 64, died while vacationing in Colorado on July 5th, just six days after a jury convicted him and former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling on conspiracy and fraud in 2001 and the collapse of the energy company.
[00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:40.288]  And I was wrong.
[00:47:40.308 --> 00:47:41.949]  At first it was six counts I read.
[00:47:42.009 --> 00:47:42.710]  This is ten.
[00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:54.076]  Lay was found guilty on ten counts of conspiracy, fraud, and misusing personal bank loans on May 25th and was facing decades in prison at his sentencing, which was scheduled for October 23rd.
[00:47:56.177 --> 00:47:59.879]  So you give the guy months and months and months and months and months to then be sentenced.
[00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:07.923]  The Reverend Dr. Bill Lawson compared Lay with civil rights leader Martin Luther King and Jesus Christ and said his name would eventually be cleared.
[00:48:10.956 --> 00:48:13.557]  I'm really holding my nose reading and hearing all this.
[00:48:13.797 --> 00:48:16.358]  Let's talk about what Ken Lay, what we know he did.
[00:48:16.378 --> 00:48:35.244]  They had their California Energy Western Trading Division, and of course Enron every day would just set the price of the coal oil, the gas, gasoline, unrefined oil, and the refineries and the pipelines and down to the trucks and the delivery.
[00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:38.419]  This is all on record.
[00:48:38.459 --> 00:48:39.259]  This is all admitted.
[00:48:39.299 --> 00:48:40.320]  We have their own documents.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.941]  Those they didn't shred have been testified to.
[00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:52.308]  They took members of the California legislature, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, even Canadian officials, U.S.
[00:48:52.568 --> 00:48:58.972]  Congress members, on multiple trips through, quote, the Enron trading room.
[00:49:00.313 --> 00:49:01.234]  And it was fake news.
[00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.131]  We're good to go.
[00:49:03.171 --> 00:49:03.791]  We're good to go.
[00:49:27.628 --> 00:49:34.993]  Of the total level of fraud and lies and false reality hoaxing that Enron was involved in.
[00:49:37.275 --> 00:49:43.259]  And then the Colorado-based Arthur Anderson accounting firm with all of its ridiculous scamming.
[00:49:44.292 --> 00:49:48.015]  I mean, Enron was just a huge, huge criminal outfit.
[00:49:48.095 --> 00:49:50.137]  And Alberto Gonzalez, of course, worked for them.
[00:49:50.177 --> 00:49:51.377]  He's now our Attorney General.
[00:49:51.958 --> 00:50:00.304]  Bush was intimately involved, running their scams with them when he was governor out of Texas through his first year and a half of his administration as president.
[00:50:02.126 --> 00:50:04.828]  And now Ken Lay is compared to Jesus.
[00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:12.834]  Yes, the preacher, the reverend, compared him to Jesus Christ.
[00:50:14.463 --> 00:50:30.012]  This is the type of sick jokes that they foist, that they hoist, that they peddle, that they shove off, that they dump, as they attempt to bamboozle the American people.
[00:50:30.072 --> 00:50:34.994]  So now, if you don't like Ken Lay, you're not a good Christian, and you don't love Jesus, is basically what they're saying.
[00:50:36.955 --> 00:50:43.179]  Organized criminals, where things got out of control with their scams, they didn't manage it properly, it blew open,
[00:50:44.308 --> 00:50:48.292]  And now... And frankly, in my gut, I don't think he's dead, folks.
[00:50:49.193 --> 00:50:53.977]  I mean, the government fakes deaths all the time of Special Forces soldiers who they want to change their identities.
[00:50:53.997 --> 00:50:55.098]  I mean, that's declassified.
[00:50:55.578 --> 00:50:59.242]  So don't think for a minute they don't do this with billionaire energy moguls.
[00:51:01.204 --> 00:51:05.548]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.748 --> 00:51:10.172]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.312 --> 00:51:14.676]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:51:14.736 --> 00:51:16.098]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:22.085]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:29.073]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.213 --> 00:51:31.216]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.596 --> 00:51:42.000]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:47.602]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:54:54.335 --> 00:55:02.478]  Let's go ahead now and take a few calls before our guest joins us at the 5 after.
[00:55:02.498 --> 00:55:04.659]  I have my call list here in front of me.
[00:55:04.699 --> 00:55:07.199]  I could use the instant message on the computer, but I don't.
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.060]  Who's up first?
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:09.880]  Jeff in California.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:10.261]  Go ahead.
[00:55:10.281 --> 00:55:19.684]  Yeah, Alex, I know you guys talk about different diseases and illnesses and vaccines and stuff like that, and
[00:55:20.194 --> 00:55:27.339]  I just wanted to make a comment about... I don't know if anybody remembers this, and I think it really plays an important part of what's going on today.
[00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:35.906]  Four Corners, the Four Corners area, which includes the states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico.
[00:55:37.387 --> 00:55:44.993]  What happened was, this was back in 1993, and I think it coincides with what's happening related to the bird flu illness.
[00:55:45.633 --> 00:55:46.654]  Navajo Nation...
[00:55:48.328 --> 00:55:52.129]  Indian Reservation is now the decommissioned army munitions base at Fort Wingate.
[00:55:52.169 --> 00:55:55.131]  It's about 30 miles east of Gallup, New Mexico.
[00:55:56.171 --> 00:56:07.155]  What happened was back in 1993, there were several Navajo Indians that died of what was first a mysterious flu-like illness.
[00:56:07.455 --> 00:56:17.339]  What happened was many concerned citizens who didn't believe the government's official version of the epidemic is propagated by the CIA-controlled media
[00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.311]  Didn't they claim that that came from rats?
[00:56:20.511 --> 00:56:21.572]  Yeah, exactly, Alex.
[00:56:21.672 --> 00:56:25.514]  And what it was, they didn't believe the medical or military establishment.
[00:56:25.994 --> 00:56:40.241]  And, of course, you know, the answers that they gave, as in many publicized cases of mysterious death, like the Legionnaire's disease back in Philadelphia in the late 70s, were, you know, were just as elusive, basically.
[00:56:40.381 --> 00:56:47.485]  And these, well, the Navajo Indians, they were calling it the Navajo flu or the Navajo disease and
[00:56:48.288 --> 00:56:49.948]  Yes, I remember and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:19.067 --> 00:57:20.789]  I don't know about that specific case.
[00:57:20.849 --> 00:57:30.636]  I mean, new diseases do develop, and we do get things from different animals that are similar to us in their metabolic system.
[00:57:32.077 --> 00:57:36.861]  Everybody always talks about things that we can't prove one way or the other, and I'm not saying we shouldn't look at mysteries.
[00:57:36.901 --> 00:57:39.403]  Mysteries are always interesting, and the brain likes a riddle.
[00:57:40.724 --> 00:57:42.926]  What about Project Shad from the 1960s until the 1980s?
[00:57:45.494 --> 00:57:47.176]  Killing U.S., killing British troops.
[00:57:47.276 --> 00:57:54.641]  I mean, BBC reported, AP's reported, they'll have people go stand out in a field, a plane flies over, nerve gas troops, and some die right there.
[00:57:55.642 --> 00:58:01.967]  Or having a young British officer march into a chamber, telling them they're going to test a flu bug on him for his country.
[00:58:02.007 --> 00:58:10.073]  He's volunteered, and they hit him with nerve gas, and he dies, and they dissect the body and take body parts and ship him back to his parents and say he died of the flu, and here's the signed form he agreed to.
[00:58:11.595 --> 00:58:13.216]  I mean, that's all declassified in public.
[00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:17.910]  They've sprayed chemical and biological weapons on New York, San Francisco.
[00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:20.051]  They've done it thousands of times.
[00:58:20.212 --> 00:58:29.177]  It's been declassified just in aerial spraying over 1,300 declassifications in 1976 from the 40s through the 70s.
[00:58:29.957 --> 00:58:31.118]  And it's just ongoing.
[00:58:31.198 --> 00:58:34.980]  So there's so many examples of the government murdering us.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.482]  I mean, it's just like Bayer knowing we're the AIDS virus.
[00:58:38.502 --> 00:58:39.042]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:40.931 --> 00:58:45.773]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.813 --> 00:58:46.254]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.414 --> 00:58:47.194]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.414 --> 00:58:52.817]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.217 --> 00:58:55.778]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.878 --> 00:58:57.439]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.325 --> 00:59:08.967]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.507 --> 00:59:13.608]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.172 --> 00:59:34.257]  Well, Israel is attacking Lebanon, blowing up government facilities, bombing the airport, putting in an air and land in the naval blockade.
[00:59:35.157 --> 00:59:36.838]  We're also attacking areas of Palestine.
[00:59:37.159 --> 00:59:38.800]  We'll get more into that coming up in the next hour.
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:52.851]  We'll be talking to Dr. Kevin Barrett, who is a professor and who heads up the Muslim, Christian, Jewish group that is all working together to expose 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:59:53.292 --> 00:59:55.614]  And so he's coming up after this first break.
[00:59:56.014 --> 00:59:59.136]  Right now, let's go to Nick in California and then Mike in Pennsylvania and others.
[00:59:59.517 --> 01:00:00.297]  Nick, you're on the air.
[01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:01.418]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:01.979 --> 01:00:02.219]  Hi.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.060]  It's an honor to meet you.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:04.701]  You're my hero.
[01:00:05.512 --> 01:00:06.592]  Well, okay.
[01:00:06.612 --> 01:00:07.052]  Well, thank you.
[01:00:07.232 --> 01:00:08.373]  I'm just trying to do my job, sir.
[01:00:09.213 --> 01:00:12.594]  Have you ever heard the quote from George H.W.
[01:00:12.634 --> 01:00:18.575]  Bush in 1992 saying that if the people ever found out what we did, we'd be lynched in the street?
[01:00:19.576 --> 01:00:21.196]  Yes, I've heard that quote.
[01:00:22.136 --> 01:00:27.077]  Well, I think it has a lot... You've got a call waiting.
[01:00:27.097 --> 01:00:27.978]  Somebody's calling you.
[01:00:28.018 --> 01:00:29.058]  You need to repeat what you said.
[01:00:31.318 --> 01:00:33.159]  It has a lot to do with the Enron thing.
[01:00:34.904 --> 01:00:36.185]  Well, yes, it does.
[01:00:37.225 --> 01:00:44.950]  Much of the stock market, much of the derivatives, many of these companies, there's no reality based on the numbers and the things they post.
[01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.911]  It's just a total scam.
[01:00:49.993 --> 01:00:51.094]  Anything else on your mind, Nick?
[01:00:52.414 --> 01:00:53.435]  Yeah, there's plenty of it.
[01:00:53.535 --> 01:00:57.097]  It's just like they killed JFK Jr.
[01:00:57.998 --> 01:00:58.118]  in 1999.
[01:00:58.718 --> 01:01:00.479]  The Bush fingerprints are all over it.
[01:01:00.859 --> 01:01:03.401]  Because he was going to spill the beans in his magazine...
[01:01:04.071 --> 01:01:05.113]  On who killed his father.
[01:01:05.855 --> 01:01:09.061]  And they're just getting rid of all these Enron witnesses like the same thing.
[01:01:10.729 --> 01:01:13.291]  I know, and it really becomes an open secret.
[01:01:13.351 --> 01:01:14.592]  It's kind of a threat to everyone.
[01:01:14.632 --> 01:01:16.013]  Yeah, we'll kill you.
[01:01:16.434 --> 01:01:18.855]  We'll have the police come up on the murderers.
[01:01:18.895 --> 01:01:24.460]  They'll run off, and then we'll still say that you committed suicide.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:34.267]  I mean, pretty soon they'll blow people's heads off on national TV, or Bush will take a hatchet and hack someone's head up right in front of everyone, and then they'll say that the person fell downstairs.
[01:01:34.748 --> 01:01:38.811]  I mean, I'm being sarcastic, but that's how ridiculous it's starting to get.
[01:01:41.317 --> 01:01:41.917]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:01:41.977 --> 01:01:42.858]  Yeah, thank you for the call.
[01:01:42.878 --> 01:01:44.298]  Let's talk to Mike in Pennsylvania.
[01:01:44.338 --> 01:01:44.838]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:01:44.858 --> 01:01:45.358]  You're on the air.
[01:01:45.378 --> 01:01:47.319]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:47.339 --> 01:01:47.819]  How you doing?
[01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:48.059]  Good.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:54.321]  Hey, just letting you know, I'm pretty new to this.
[01:01:54.601 --> 01:01:57.843]  I just got woken up to the truth about a few weeks ago.
[01:01:58.503 --> 01:02:02.684]  I watched the Loose Change video that's on the Internet about 9-11.
[01:02:02.704 --> 01:02:04.485]  That's been waking a lot of people up.
[01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:05.985]  Yeah, and then I got...
[01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:13.952]  I was told about you and Infowars.com, and I watch a lot of your videos online.
[01:02:13.992 --> 01:02:17.653]  I'm sorry, I don't have the money to be purchasing your videos right now.
[01:02:17.673 --> 01:02:18.333]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:18.393 --> 01:02:20.114]  We authorize people to make copies.
[01:02:20.454 --> 01:02:21.314]  We want you to see them.
[01:02:21.674 --> 01:02:24.355]  So please don't apologize for something we want to thank you for.
[01:02:24.835 --> 01:02:25.435]  Yeah.
[01:02:26.296 --> 01:02:27.416]  A few quick things.
[01:02:28.516 --> 01:02:30.197]  Did you call C-SPAN this morning?
[01:02:31.377 --> 01:02:31.857]  No, I didn't.
[01:02:32.357 --> 01:02:33.898]  Okay.
[01:02:33.978 --> 01:02:35.178]  It sounded just like you.
[01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:36.759]  Well, what happened?
[01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:42.845]  This guy from, I think he's from New Jersey, named Saxon, was calling.
[01:02:43.265 --> 01:02:57.213]  He must have said something talking about the ideology of the terrorists, you know, and talking about how the Arabs are the ones responsible for 9-11 and the whole war is against an ideology.
[01:02:57.233 --> 01:02:57.914]  Okay, what happened?
[01:02:57.994 --> 01:02:58.454]  What happened?
[01:02:59.135 --> 01:03:02.997]  Oh, well, the gentleman, he just totally, he was like, you're,
[01:03:03.632 --> 01:03:06.493]  You're so... Everything that you're saying is anti-American.
[01:03:06.733 --> 01:03:10.735]  Okay, so a caller called in and what happened?
[01:03:10.795 --> 01:03:11.315]  Nothing.
[01:03:11.335 --> 01:03:12.475]  I was just wondering if it was you.
[01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:14.676]  Okay, well, why did you think it was me?
[01:03:14.716 --> 01:03:16.337]  What did the caller say?
[01:03:17.457 --> 01:03:22.579]  He said that... It sounded like a quote exactly from you.
[01:03:22.619 --> 01:03:28.121]  You were like, straight from the Constitution, that we are given our God-given rights...
[01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.315]  I don't know, it was really... Okay, listen, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:45.342]  No, I'm not... I didn't call C-SPAN, but people should start calling on the air, on the live shows, and telling them to air the panel discussion that they came and videotaped two and a half weeks ago.
[01:03:46.242 --> 01:03:47.163]  Almost three weeks ago.
[01:03:48.163 --> 01:03:49.084]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:03:49.104 --> 01:03:49.484]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.136 --> 01:03:56.978]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.238 --> 01:03:58.820]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.843]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.164 --> 01:04:10.909]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.229 --> 01:04:13.231]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:16.254]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.354 --> 01:04:21.018]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.238 --> 01:04:25.642]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:25.882 --> 01:04:33.109]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:35.771]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:54.935 --> 01:04:55.976]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.296 --> 01:04:59.078]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.359 --> 01:05:03.502]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:04.783]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:09.647]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.134 --> 01:05:12.255]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.755 --> 01:05:27.443]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.503 --> 01:05:34.547]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:34.907 --> 01:05:39.249]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.

[01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:43.594]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:43.614 --> 01:06:44.474]  Dr. Kevin Barrett
[01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:13.440]  He has a PhD from the University of Wisconsin in Madison in African Languages and Literature and Arabic.
[01:07:14.261 --> 01:07:18.262]  In November of 2004, he founded the Muslim-Jewish Christian Alliance for 9-11 Truth.
[01:07:18.663 --> 01:07:33.949]  Barrett explains his decision to move from literature to activism by citing several different reports by the Israeli intellectual, an endorser who moved from Russia literature to activism in response to Ariel Sharon's outrages of 2001.
[01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:36.270]  We have links to the organization
[01:07:37.638 --> 01:07:43.060]  That Dr. Barrett founded up on Infowars.com.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:50.123]  You can link through over to their Muslim Jewish Christian Alliance for 9-11 Truth.
[01:07:50.523 --> 01:07:54.844]  That was one of the co-sponsors of the big 9-11 symposium that I attended.
[01:07:54.884 --> 01:07:58.686]  That was a keynote speaker back in early June in Chicago.
[01:08:00.847 --> 01:08:04.128]  In a few minutes here, we're going to play the clip from him a few nights ago.
[01:08:05.425 --> 01:08:11.587]  On Hannity and Combs, I think you did a pretty good job in standing up to these individuals, especially Hannity.
[01:08:11.627 --> 01:08:14.988]  So let's go ahead and go to Dr. Kevin Barnett.
[01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:26.911]  He's also a Muslim since 1992 and has taught Islam, English, French, Arabic, Humanities, African Literature, American Civilization and Folklore at colleges and universities in San Francisco, Bay Area, Paris, Madison, Wisconsin.
[01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:29.191]  Dr. Barrett, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:30.592]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:31.652]  I'm really pleased to be with you.
[01:08:32.179 --> 01:08:32.959]  You bet, my friend.
[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.242]  Just before we play this Hannity and Combs piece, how did you wake up to 9-11?
[01:08:38.302 --> 01:08:40.002]  Why did you form this organization?
[01:08:40.703 --> 01:08:42.743]  And why did you join Scholars for 9-11 Truth?
[01:08:43.644 --> 01:08:46.445]  Well, you know, Alex, I have to admit I'm a little slower than you.
[01:08:46.465 --> 01:08:48.826]  I mean, you were on top of it before it happened.
[01:08:48.846 --> 01:08:51.087]  It took me two years after it happened to figure it out.
[01:08:51.107 --> 01:08:56.609]  I mean, I saw there were a whole lot of anomalies in the official story, but I just thought, well, you know, we'll never know.
[01:08:56.629 --> 01:08:58.890]  I'm sure maybe it was an inside job.
[01:08:58.930 --> 01:08:59.950]  It wasn't until I saw...
[01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:14.412]  Terry Mason, the French guy who wrote about the Pentagon, what may have hit it, on Al Jazeera TV debating this guy from the Pentagon and just making mincemeat of him, that I said, hey, this is interesting, okay?
[01:09:14.432 --> 01:09:19.714]  At the beginning of the show, the poll was running 75% of the respondents say U.S.
[01:09:19.754 --> 01:09:22.696]  government did 9-11 and 25% say it was Al Qaeda.
[01:09:23.156 --> 01:09:24.737]  And by the end of that show, it was up to 89-11.
[01:09:27.003 --> 01:09:31.166]  I said, man, you know, that Pentagon suit was just throwing insults at Mason.
[01:09:31.186 --> 01:09:34.028]  He didn't have any evidence, and Mason had a lot of evidence.
[01:09:34.048 --> 01:09:35.809]  There's something interesting going on here.
[01:09:35.849 --> 01:09:37.510]  So that awakened my interest.
[01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:42.934]  And then when I heard David Griffin was doing his book, I had to start looking into it myself.
[01:09:42.974 --> 01:09:48.078]  Because, you know, I know Griffin from way back as a brilliant philosopher and theologian.
[01:09:48.278 --> 01:09:49.859]  I cited his stuff in my dissertation.
[01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:53.822]  So I said, yeah, he's looking into this, and he's saying there's really evidence for inside jobs.
[01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:55.515]  He may be right.
[01:09:55.535 --> 01:09:56.756]  I better take a look for myself.
[01:09:56.816 --> 01:10:01.297]  I did, and lo and behold, it's just pretty amazing and in your face, isn't it?
[01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:02.818]  It is.
[01:10:02.878 --> 01:10:06.079]  Tell us a little bit about this Fox News piece before we play it.
[01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:07.399]  Okay.
[01:10:07.679 --> 01:10:15.562]  Yeah, I've been in the middle of this controversy dating back about ten days or so when I got ambushed by a right-wing, well, I should say a Bushite.
[01:10:16.249 --> 01:10:21.353]  A talk show host named Jessica McBride, who called me up in the afternoon and said, Oh, would you like to be on my show tonight?
[01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:23.875]  I hear you're doing really interesting work.
[01:10:23.975 --> 01:10:25.696]  Could you send me a syllabus so I can see what you teach?
[01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:26.737]  And so I sent it to her.
[01:10:26.837 --> 01:10:37.044]  And I got on her show at 8 o'clock that night, and she introduced me as Wisconsin's Ward Churchill, an evil man who's teaching horrible things to our innocent children.
[01:10:37.244 --> 01:10:41.527]  So she was trying to start a controversy and be the darling and be on TV.
[01:10:41.807 --> 01:10:42.248]  Exactly.
[01:10:42.268 --> 01:10:45.250]  And then the very next morning, this guy, Steve Nast,
[01:10:45.886 --> 01:10:51.891]  The local troglodyte in the Wisconsin legislature came out with a press release calling for me to be fired.
[01:10:52.232 --> 01:11:11.188]  Now, Steve Nass is not really that quick of a thinker, and so it seems to me that the fact that he had this press release out the very next morning after this radio show suggested to me that he and McBride had gotten together and kind of set me up in an attempt to get Nass's name into the papers and also to get McBride some ratings.
[01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:13.571]  It's backfired on them since then.
[01:11:13.751 --> 01:11:20.096]  I've been fighting back and having a real good time doing it, and this fight has kind of gotten bigger and bigger, and I ended up on Fox.
[01:11:21.897 --> 01:11:27.741]  If you can prove a conspiracy to try to get you fired civilly, there are very serious penalties.
[01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:40.389]  Well, yeah, and that's why I've been asking some of the journalists around here to look into this and go ask this NASS guy whether he had discussed this with Jessica McBride before my radio show.
[01:11:41.191 --> 01:11:43.934]  Because he's been indicating that he just happened to hear it on the radio.
[01:11:44.415 --> 01:11:46.217]  And I'm not sure that's necessarily the case.
[01:11:46.257 --> 01:11:59.432]  And if it isn't, and if he's been misleading the public about this, then not only is he wasting the taxpayers' dollars, but he's also engaging in some pretty deceitful behavior that could even get bringing some civil... Well, that's what neocons do.
[01:11:59.472 --> 01:12:00.593]  They collude with each other.
[01:12:00.633 --> 01:12:01.434]  They sneak around.
[01:12:01.454 --> 01:12:02.095]  They conspire.
[01:12:03.045 --> 01:12:09.410]  Let's go ahead and play the Hannity and Combs piece, and then we'll be right back with you, Doctor.
[01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:10.030]  Here it is.
[01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:12.312]  This is from, what was this, Monday or Tuesday night?
[01:12:13.012 --> 01:12:14.713]  Oh, which, you know, I'm forgetting it.
[01:12:15.854 --> 01:12:17.455]  It was just a few nights ago.
[01:12:17.475 --> 01:12:18.856]  I believe it was Tuesday night.
[01:12:18.896 --> 01:12:22.019]  It's posted on prisonblinded.com and infowars.com.
[01:12:22.059 --> 01:12:22.379]  Here it is.
[01:12:23.268 --> 01:12:27.149]  It's happening largely through this false flag terrorism.
[01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:45.894]  It looks to me like not only 9-11, but also Madrid 7-7, the Bali hotel bombing, and probably most of these so-called Zarqawi-style bombings in Iraq are all false flag operations being carried out by a special wing of probably U.S.
[01:12:45.954 --> 01:12:47.795]  or Western military intelligence.
[01:12:48.553 --> 01:12:58.038]  That was University of Wisconsin professor Kevin Barrett, who has recently drawn criticism for plans to teach an Islamic studies course next fall that will incorporate conspiracy theories that the U.S.
[01:12:58.078 --> 01:13:00.099]  government was involved in the events of September 11.
[01:13:00.519 --> 01:13:02.400]  Professor Barrett joins us now.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.862]  Professor, can you give us the context within which you teach this course?
[01:13:07.401 --> 01:13:07.901]  Well, yeah, sure.
[01:13:07.921 --> 01:13:09.702]  I'm teaching an introductory course on Islam.
[01:13:10.402 --> 01:13:14.903]  And I think it's really important to cover these contemporary political issues.
[01:13:15.443 --> 01:13:17.764]  And one of them is, of course, the so-called war on terror.
[01:13:18.204 --> 01:13:23.466]  Now, the fact is that the great majority of the world's Muslims believe that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:13:23.846 --> 01:13:25.066]  But that's your opinion, right?
[01:13:25.586 --> 01:13:27.807]  Well, no, that's your opinion that there was an inside job.
[01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:34.776]  Well, after studying the evidence pretty intensively for two and a half years, I am convinced that 9-11 was, in fact, an inside job.
[01:13:34.796 --> 01:13:39.140]  Are students required to regurgitate that in some way in order to do well in your class?
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:39.941]  Of course they're not.
[01:13:39.961 --> 01:13:40.441]  That's ridiculous.
[01:13:40.461 --> 01:13:42.744]  No, I'm not interested in making students regurgitate anything.
[01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:49.770]  I'm interested in training people how to use critical thinking skills to look at the evidence in any area and come to their own conclusions.
[01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:50.791]  Is this a required class?
[01:13:50.811 --> 01:13:51.171]  No, it's not.
[01:13:53.701 --> 01:13:55.501]  So this is basically an elective class.
[01:13:56.022 --> 01:14:00.062]  How much of the time is spent focusing on who caused 9-11?
[01:14:01.623 --> 01:14:02.383]  Only about one week.
[01:14:02.423 --> 01:14:05.884]  We're looking at the war on terror for one week and in fact it's not focusing on who caused it.
[01:14:06.264 --> 01:14:08.544]  It's looking at the main interpretations of 9-11.
[01:14:08.624 --> 01:14:18.046]  And there are really several different ways of looking at 9-11 and one of them of course is the standard American story of the war on terror that changed everything.
[01:14:18.447 --> 01:14:19.427]  It set us at war.
[01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:23.651]  To roll back our civil liberties, to double our military budget.
[01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:25.953]  All those things have been planned before 9-11.
[01:14:26.093 --> 01:14:28.216]  Every one of those things was put in place before 9-11.
[01:14:28.256 --> 01:14:34.002]  You objectively put forth that view as well as the view of how you perceive Muslims viewing us.
[01:14:34.022 --> 01:14:36.305]  So they presented in a fair and balanced manner.
[01:14:37.114 --> 01:14:37.474]  Of course.
[01:14:37.694 --> 01:14:40.576]  In the classroom, I always present things in a fair and balanced manner.
[01:14:40.936 --> 01:14:45.018]  Outside the classroom, when I'm an activist or a satirist, I'll tell it like it is.
[01:14:45.379 --> 01:14:53.543]  Inside the classroom, I'll present all of the defensible interpretations and let the students use their own critical reasoning skills to come to their own conclusions.
[01:14:54.043 --> 01:14:55.684]  All right, Mr. Barrett, Sean Hannity here.
[01:14:55.744 --> 01:15:02.348]  Do you really believe that 9-11 was an inside job, not just 9-11, but Madrid and Bali and the Zakaoui operations?
[01:15:02.368 --> 01:15:04.509]  Well, you know, actually... I'm at... Hold on a second.
[01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:05.529]  Yeah, yeah, okay, okay, finish up.
[01:15:05.549 --> 01:15:06.290]  Do you believe personally...
[01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:09.971]  That these are inside jobs, yes or no?
[01:15:11.311 --> 01:15:12.212]  It's not quite that simple.
[01:15:12.632 --> 01:15:15.833]  I do know, I don't believe, I know that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:21.514]  Professor Stephen Jones has found residue of permeate on the steel samples from the World Trade Center.
[01:15:21.754 --> 01:15:24.515]  We now know that it was taken down in a controlled demolition.
[01:15:24.995 --> 01:15:27.996]  So you believe that the buildings came down in a controlled demolition?
[01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:28.916]  Well, I don't believe it.
[01:15:28.956 --> 01:15:31.257]  I've looked at the evidence, and the evidence is overwhelming.
[01:15:31.477 --> 01:15:38.581]  All right, the evidence is overwhelming to you because you're a conspiracy nut, but... No, actually, all of you, I ask your viewers to take a look at this evidence for themselves.
[01:15:38.841 --> 01:15:39.541]  They can go to st911.org.
[01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:40.542]  That's dollars for 9-11 proofs.
[01:15:40.562 --> 01:15:41.242]  Take a look.
[01:15:41.262 --> 01:15:43.083]  Take a look at the demolition.
[01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:45.365]  Morgan Reynolds, a former Bush administration official, says that...
[01:15:53.889 --> 01:15:57.372]  The Bush administration blew the World Trade Center to kingdom come.
[01:15:57.652 --> 01:16:00.233]  That's a direct quote from a member of the Bush administration itself.
[01:16:00.253 --> 01:16:02.455]  They blew the World Trade Center to kingdom come.
[01:16:02.515 --> 01:16:03.756]  The Jews were told to leave.
[01:16:03.816 --> 01:16:06.578]  We've heard a lot of these sick, bizarre theories.
[01:16:06.718 --> 01:16:10.200]  I don't believe any of them, but you're allowed to believe what you want, but that's not what's at hand here.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:17.745]  The issue is whether or not you, with your bizarre theories, are the best, the most confident... I think you have the bizarre theory.
[01:16:17.785 --> 01:16:22.889]  You think it was 19 guys with box cutters led by a guy with dialysis in a cave in Afghanistan?
[01:16:22.909 --> 01:16:23.569]  That's ridiculous.
[01:16:24.269 --> 01:16:26.651]  I mean, that's the craziest conspiracy theory of all of them.
[01:16:27.511 --> 01:16:27.791]  Okay.
[01:16:27.931 --> 01:16:29.312]  I wish I had the Twilight Zone music.
[01:16:29.472 --> 01:16:30.553]  Now, here's my next question.
[01:16:30.973 --> 01:16:33.674]  The issue that is at hand here, you're entitled to have your opinion.
[01:16:33.694 --> 01:16:34.935]  I don't really care what you believe.
[01:16:35.475 --> 01:16:40.998]  But if we're talking about a captive group of students in a classroom... I'm not going to hold them captive.
[01:16:41.198 --> 01:16:42.259]  Hang on a second.
[01:16:42.299 --> 01:16:43.339]  Well, they're sitting in your classroom.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.381]  And you have a position of authority.
[01:16:46.261 --> 01:16:49.783]  I'm wondering, the question is whether or not you're the most competent to teach them.
[01:16:50.442 --> 01:16:51.963]  And most people think you're a nut.
[01:16:52.383 --> 01:16:54.664]  Most people think your views are not even worth listening to.
[01:16:54.965 --> 01:17:02.509]  We just had a poll here in Madison, and we found that 90% of the respondents at Channel 3000 poll said that I should be allowed to teach.
[01:17:02.569 --> 01:17:03.229]  Only 10% said I should.
[01:17:03.269 --> 01:17:05.070]  And 60% agreed with me about the questions I'm raising about 9-11.
[01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.711]  60% of the respondents.
[01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:12.974]  You're in the minority.
[01:17:13.355 --> 01:17:17.796]  I don't think this is the proper forum, though, for people that hold extremist views like yourself.
[01:17:18.456 --> 01:17:19.516]  No, you guys are extremists.
[01:17:19.576 --> 01:17:22.057]  Fox News is the biggest bunch of extremists on the planet.
[01:17:22.157 --> 01:17:26.879]  But reasonable people see you as an extremist, and I don't think you're the most appropriate guy to teach that class.
[01:17:27.259 --> 01:17:32.340]  I don't think you're the most appropriate guy to be on the airwaves spewing your venom throughout this country.
[01:17:33.041 --> 01:17:34.801]  I think you guys should be taken off the airwaves.
[01:17:34.821 --> 01:17:36.462]  We don't want to silence anybody.
[01:17:36.482 --> 01:17:37.122]  Thank you, Professor.
[01:17:41.923 --> 01:17:44.044]  Now, of course, you're being flippant.
[01:17:44.084 --> 01:17:45.585]  He's saying you shouldn't be teaching the class.
[01:17:45.605 --> 01:17:47.666]  You're saying back to him, well, then you shouldn't be on the air.
[01:17:48.066 --> 01:17:49.807]  And then they go, oh, you want to take free speech.
[01:17:49.867 --> 01:17:52.068]  They're saying, take your free speech away.
[01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:54.490]  And then you say, okay, we'll take yours away, too.
[01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:55.770]  And, oh, my gosh, he's evil.
[01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:56.811]  He wants to take free speech.
[01:17:56.851 --> 01:17:57.711]  That's double think.
[01:17:58.111 --> 01:17:59.072]  And they try to twist it.
[01:17:59.998 --> 01:18:00.598]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:18:00.819 --> 01:18:02.720]  I mean, the majority, and we'll come back and talk about this.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:04.280]  We've got a break right now, Doctor.
[01:18:04.621 --> 01:18:07.822]  But I just want to get this out right now.
[01:18:08.703 --> 01:18:13.725]  The vast majority of Americans now, 48% believe the government carried out the attacks.
[01:18:13.886 --> 01:18:15.506]  68% believe that there's a cover-up.
[01:18:15.967 --> 01:18:22.010]  A minority then doesn't buy into reality and buys into the official government fairytale.
[01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:25.791]  But they try to keep making the issue about how you're teaching this in school.
[01:18:26.271 --> 01:18:30.492]  All you're teaching is look at the different views in the world.
[01:18:30.612 --> 01:18:42.834]  And if the majority of people in the world, even higher in Muslim countries, it's like 90%, believe it's an inside job, and this is a Muslim studies class, then you absolutely should be looking at this.
[01:18:42.894 --> 01:18:48.755]  And I know actually the vast majority of your course, this section on it, actually gives the government view.
[01:18:49.035 --> 01:18:50.816]  So I think you're not being hardcore enough.
[01:18:50.836 --> 01:18:51.436]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.753 --> 01:18:57.074]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.094 --> 01:19:00.935]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:02.456 --> 01:19:12.100]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.821]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:16.801 --> 01:19:18.182]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:18.982 --> 01:19:29.808]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:30.448 --> 01:19:32.950]  Star War technology at its best.

[01:19:53.187 --> 01:19:57.091]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:57.311 --> 01:20:09.581]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:20:10.001 --> 01:20:10.422]  The U.S.
[01:20:10.462 --> 01:20:16.046]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:20:16.447 --> 01:20:18.649]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.970]  We're good to go.
[01:20:41.118 --> 01:20:41.658]  We're good to go.
[01:20:41.678 --> 01:20:41.819]  I think?
[01:20:54.198 --> 01:20:54.538]  We're good to go.
[01:21:18.257 --> 01:21:18.617]  We're good.

[01:22:45.602 --> 01:22:47.143]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:47.263 --> 01:22:48.945]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:50.686]  Talking to Professor Dr. Kevin Barrett.
[01:22:50.706 --> 01:22:53.828]  We're honored to have him for the full hour.
[01:22:53.848 --> 01:22:53.928]  Dr.
[01:23:13.024 --> 01:23:19.767]  They hate having to have people like you and myself on national television, Dr. Bob Bowman, many others.
[01:23:20.467 --> 01:23:29.491]  But they're having to respond now, and you notice they're panicked, they're upset, because the majority of Americans now know the truth, and it is snowballing.
[01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:33.193]  Right now it's growing exponentially, and they are beginning to panic.
[01:23:33.713 --> 01:23:40.156]  And then last night they had Dr. Bob Bowman on, and he kept saying, there was no controlled demolition, we saw the airplanes, as if that proved something.
[01:23:40.196 --> 01:23:41.637]  Of course the government used airplanes.
[01:23:42.037 --> 01:23:49.071]  So they're building straw man right in front of us, but comment on that exchange with you and Hannity, the ultra-liberal.
[01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:50.815]  He's not really a conservative.
[01:23:50.835 --> 01:23:51.817]  It's all a false paradigm.
[01:23:51.837 --> 01:23:53.039]  I mean, he supports Bush.
[01:23:53.059 --> 01:23:54.001]  He's for the biggest government ever.
[01:23:54.986 --> 01:23:55.927]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:23:56.087 --> 01:24:00.389]  You know, I keep telling people 9-11 is not about right versus left, it's right versus wrong.
[01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:05.892]  But I agree with you that the whole right-left paradigm, you know, which dates back to the French Revolution, doesn't really apply anymore.
[01:24:06.212 --> 01:24:15.517]  And I think it makes a lot more sense to look at things in terms of people who are trying to put together a huge oppressive government and people who are trying to keep that from happening.
[01:24:16.078 --> 01:24:18.199]  And I'm definitely on the side of the latter.
[01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:22.905]  And Hannity and Combs, I mean, they're pretty much the dupes of these Trotskyite neocons.
[01:24:22.925 --> 01:24:24.706]  I mean, these neocons are not conservatives.
[01:24:24.786 --> 01:24:27.447]  I mean, they're, you know, Trotskyites and Jacobins.
[01:24:27.467 --> 01:24:37.812]  They're just, you know, trying to set up a new myth that will allow this elite of self-proclaimed supermen to ride...
[01:24:38.362 --> 01:24:39.362]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:24:39.382 --> 01:24:42.063]  What's the response you've gotten since you went on the show?
[01:24:42.103 --> 01:24:45.844]  It's been amazingly good, especially if you count the people who saw it on the Internet.
[01:24:45.884 --> 01:24:51.445]  But even among people who just happened upon it on Fox News or Fox TV, it's running over 50% in my favor.
[01:25:08.662 --> 01:25:09.983]  About 60%, I would guess.
[01:25:10.704 --> 01:25:14.427]  If you throw in the people who caught it on the Internet, it's like 95% in my favor.
[01:25:14.867 --> 01:25:26.896]  Of course, the other 5% are all these illiterate people who were thrown around obscenities and death threats, but 95% are a lot more literate and articulate, which tells you something.
[01:25:29.016 --> 01:25:30.337]  Well, the neocons have a problem.
[01:25:30.357 --> 01:25:33.298]  They try to claim it's evil liberals saying the government carried out 9-11.
[01:25:33.618 --> 01:25:37.740]  No, we know the Democrats and Republicans are owned, the leadership is, by the very same crime syndicates.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:44.842]  Really, some of the strongest people from day one exposing 9-11 have been paleo-conservatives, true conservatives.
[01:25:45.543 --> 01:25:48.044]  Absolutely, and I try to make that point as often as I can.
[01:25:48.664 --> 01:25:52.366]  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to make that on Fox News, but it's true.
[01:25:53.266 --> 01:25:55.447]  Some of the best, strongest voices in 9-11 truth
[01:25:56.597 --> 01:26:14.407]  are these true conservatives, people who really want to preserve the good side of our tradition, things like our Constitution, our tradition of limited government, our avoidance of getting entangled in foreign wars, our preservation of individual liberty against collectivism.
[01:26:14.427 --> 01:26:17.289]  These are all the basic tenets of real conservatism.
[01:26:18.099 --> 01:26:21.001]  Well, I couldn't agree with you more on that statement.
[01:26:21.021 --> 01:26:22.862]  Where do you think this is going in the future?
[01:26:22.882 --> 01:26:24.943]  I mean, it really seems the 9-11 Truth Movement is...
[01:26:37.168 --> 01:26:41.830]  Well, you know, it looks like the world is starting to catch up to you, Alex.
[01:26:41.850 --> 01:26:44.050]  I understand that you actually were hip to 9-11 before it happened.
[01:27:05.621 --> 01:27:13.388]  And, you know, being that far ahead of the crowd, I suppose, has its good side and its bad side, but it must be nice to see more and more people catching up to you.
[01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:18.472]  Well, that's been my main mission, is to spread the word about government-sponsored terrorism for about 10 years.
[01:27:19.113 --> 01:27:23.236]  I've been on air for 12, but about 10 years ago I figured out government-sponsored terror was their key.
[01:27:23.256 --> 01:27:24.577]  I mean, this is nothing new.
[01:27:24.597 --> 01:27:26.359]  Oh, that's for sure, yeah.
[01:27:26.839 --> 01:27:27.560]  And it makes sense.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.781]  You just have to think about it.
[01:27:29.822 --> 01:27:32.924]  People have a built-in aversion to killing other people.
[01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:33.805]  And
[01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:39.890]  The only way that people pretty much feel okay about killing another human being is if they're being attacked.
[01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:51.992]  And that means that if there's a government that's stronger than some other group and wants to go attack them and steal their stuff, they have to frame the coming war as a defensive operation.
[01:27:52.412 --> 01:27:56.733]  And to do that, of course, they have to make it look like they were attacked.
[01:27:57.253 --> 01:28:01.734]  And hence the basic false flag war trigger attack, which is as old as history.
[01:28:02.601 --> 01:28:08.365]  Also, of course, violence creates this need for some protection from the violence.
[01:28:08.385 --> 01:28:13.989]  And so the government, which is the place, they want to get the money and the prestige.
[01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:16.111]  They want to be the heroes.
[01:28:16.151 --> 01:28:23.116]  I mean, it's so sick to watch the people that carried out 9-11 grandstanding as the heroes and hugging and kissing widows.
[01:28:23.176 --> 01:28:25.458]  I mean, it literally has made me nauseous, Dr.,
[01:28:26.318 --> 01:28:27.538]  It is sickening, isn't it?
[01:28:27.658 --> 01:28:38.461]  It's like watching Ted Bundy bust some innocent person after he's killed ten people, and then he sends them to the electric chair and he pulls the lever, talking about how he's killing a bad person when he made all the murders.
[01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:39.921]  We'll be right back with our guest, Doctor.
[01:28:40.702 --> 01:28:41.122]  Stay there.
[01:28:43.482 --> 01:28:44.383]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.843 --> 01:28:46.483]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.383 --> 01:28:50.064]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.388 --> 01:28:53.808]  We're good to go.
[01:29:11.374 --> 01:29:12.114]  We're good to go.
[01:29:27.699 --> 01:29:28.540]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.557 --> 01:29:57.141]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.181 --> 01:29:57.682]  are located?
[01:29:57.882 --> 01:30:01.285]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:30:01.506 --> 01:30:06.210]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:30:06.491 --> 01:30:11.496]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:30:11.676 --> 01:30:12.336]  We're good to go.
[01:30:31.203 --> 01:30:31.683]  We're good to go.
[01:30:55.357 --> 01:30:56.018]  Hey, Bill.
[01:30:56.358 --> 01:30:57.439]  I'm buying lunch today.
[01:30:57.779 --> 01:30:58.600]  And check this out.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:30:59.801]  I bought a new car.
[01:30:59.901 --> 01:31:00.541]  Wow, John.
[01:31:00.601 --> 01:31:05.125]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[01:31:05.705 --> 01:31:09.828]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[01:31:10.168 --> 01:31:15.072]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:15.492 --> 01:31:17.934]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:18.254 --> 01:31:21.597]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[01:31:21.837 --> 01:31:22.738]  Whoa, that's awesome.
[01:31:23.078 --> 01:31:25.460]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:28.082]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[01:31:28.202 --> 01:31:28.863]  It's incredible.
[01:31:29.223 --> 01:31:36.709]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[01:31:37.029 --> 01:31:41.974]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:42.574 --> 01:31:43.255]  Check, please.
[01:31:43.715 --> 01:31:44.616]  I got this one, Bill.
[01:31:45.016 --> 01:31:45.697]  Sure, John.
[01:31:45.837 --> 01:31:50.440]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:50.581 --> 01:31:50.841]  Deal.
[01:31:57.902 --> 01:31:59.323]  Dr. Kevin Barrett is our guest.
[01:31:59.343 --> 01:32:03.066]  We'll be taking your calls coming up here in about 10 minutes on 9-11 and the whole Neocon agenda.
[01:32:03.086 --> 01:32:03.206]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:03.226 --> 01:32:03.266]  800-259-9231.
[01:32:03.286 --> 01:32:05.928]  I'm going to take a minute out here before we go back to the doctor.
[01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:18.693]  To remind you that I personally have made four films on 9-11, exposing it as an inside job.
[01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:26.255]  I produced the first film on 9-11, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and some say it is still my best, right under three hours long.
[01:32:26.975 --> 01:32:28.335]  It's an excellent film you should get.
[01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:34.117]  Marshall Lobb, of course, is a film I made last year on 9-11, probably one of my most professional films.
[01:32:35.397 --> 01:32:40.098]  And then we also made the film The Masters of Terror,
[01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:43.412]  And my latest film is Terror Storm.
[01:32:43.472 --> 01:32:47.475]  And Terror Storm gets into the overthrow of Mosaddegh, staged by the CIA, declassified.
[01:32:47.815 --> 01:32:48.595]  The Israeli-U.S.
[01:32:48.635 --> 01:32:52.038]  attack on our own ship, the USS Liberty, to blame it on Egypt.
[01:32:53.259 --> 01:32:54.860]  We get into a whole bunch of other cases.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:01.625]  We get into Hitler, not just with the Reichstag, but also attacking Poland, after staging an attack on their own facility on the border with Gleiwitz.
[01:33:02.582 --> 01:33:04.524]  We then interview so many people.
[01:33:04.604 --> 01:33:22.319]  Cindy Sheehan, Ray McGovern, Morgan Reynolds, Professor Dr. Stephen Jones, Andy Michon, MI5, David Shaler, MI5, Michael Nietzsche, of course, former Blair Cabinet member and current member of Parliament, Charlie Sheen.
[01:33:23.239 --> 01:33:24.920]  It is such an important film.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.780]  We go to Crawford.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:29.241]  We show you the crazy neocons believing WMDs were found.
[01:33:29.281 --> 01:33:30.062]  We expose 9-11.
[01:33:30.142 --> 01:33:31.042]  They blow up.
[01:33:31.062 --> 01:33:33.543]  It's incredible footage.
[01:33:33.883 --> 01:33:36.004]  We get into Big Brother and the police state.
[01:33:36.024 --> 01:33:38.825]  We get into double-think and brainwashed populations.
[01:33:40.986 --> 01:33:44.447]  Terror Storm, I've got to tell you, blows all my other films out of the water.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:55.367]  We have a professional score done by a local, I guess you'd call it symphony group that does music for major films like Scanner Darkly now in theaters.
[01:33:55.767 --> 01:34:00.070]  Graham Reynolds did the score and performed it with a small orchestra.
[01:34:00.951 --> 01:34:04.233]  We also, of course, it just has incredible graphics.
[01:34:04.413 --> 01:34:07.135]  It is for the MTV generation.
[01:34:07.555 --> 01:34:08.555]  It's really flashy.
[01:34:09.156 --> 01:34:11.937]  And we're proud of the information, though, is what's important.
[01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:13.538]  And it's 1995.
[01:34:13.578 --> 01:34:14.659]  We have an emergency edition.
[01:34:14.679 --> 01:34:15.959]  I'm signing every copy that goes out.
[01:34:16.219 --> 01:34:20.622]  It doesn't have the extras because the big official film won't be ready for three or four more weeks.
[01:34:21.454 --> 01:34:22.856]  And we just got to get this out now.
[01:34:22.916 --> 01:34:24.358]  So please go to InfoWars.com.
[01:34:24.378 --> 01:34:29.825]  Get the special emergency release edition of Terror Storm today.
[01:34:30.306 --> 01:34:31.527]  InfoWars.com.
[01:34:31.547 --> 01:34:33.810]  You can order there off the Safe, Secure Online video and bookstore.
[01:34:34.150 --> 01:34:38.256]  Or call, feel free to get Terror Storm or any of my other films or books I carry, other videos I carry.
[01:34:38.556 --> 01:34:38.896]  We're good to go.
[01:35:06.913 --> 01:35:07.733]  You're signing up.
[01:35:07.773 --> 01:35:09.453]  Just pay for the bandwidth and the webmasters.
[01:35:10.374 --> 01:35:12.774]  Our goal is to break even and get the word out, and that is happening.
[01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:13.994]  So we're expanding it.
[01:35:14.354 --> 01:35:25.396]  Over 1,000 pieces of media, all 15 of my films, including Terror Storm, in three different formats and two different quality bandwidths, high and low, depending on your connection, whether it be a T1 or a dial-up, you can get it.
[01:35:25.896 --> 01:35:27.156]  Downloads, they're all there.
[01:35:27.697 --> 01:35:34.278]  My weekly TV reports, my special reports, we've already uploaded half of the 20-hour conference to prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:34.298 --> 01:35:35.978]  The rest is going up in the next week and a half.
[01:35:37.044 --> 01:35:38.285]  From the Big 9-11 Conference.
[01:35:38.305 --> 01:35:43.728]  Just to give you an idea of what you get, you get my book, Paul Watson's book, e-editions there at prisonplanet.tv as well.
[01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:50.352]  $5.95 a month to get a subscription, 15 cents a day is what it averages out to, or get a yearly membership and get three months free.
[01:35:50.653 --> 01:35:54.435]  So please take action now, and your purchase also makes this broadcast possible.
[01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:57.437]  Again, your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231 if you have questions for Dr. Kevin Barrett.
[01:35:57.477 --> 01:35:57.717]  Kevin, any...
[01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:05.597]  Any facets of 9-11 you want to cover?
[01:36:05.657 --> 01:36:19.788]  Any facets of the attack on Iraq and what Israel's doing right now, rampaging around there in the Middle East, trying to escalate, as many foreign ministers are saying, into a full-bore regional war that could tip off World War III?
[01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:23.171]  The White House is even saying that, of course, loving it every minute.
[01:36:23.732 --> 01:36:26.094]  This is the provocation to go into Syria, it looks like.
[01:36:26.574 --> 01:36:28.936]  Give us your take on that and any other issues you think are important.
[01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:40.533]  Well, Alex, you know, I think that it's just horrendous the way these neoconservatives have taken over our government through their 9-11 coup d'etat, and now they're heading straight towards world war.
[01:36:40.873 --> 01:36:42.014]  They want to have a world war.
[01:36:42.414 --> 01:36:46.935]  And the reason for it, as far as I can determine, is that they figure that, well, you know, U.S.
[01:36:46.975 --> 01:36:48.896]  military is still the biggest bully on the block.
[01:36:49.597 --> 01:37:00.739]  And we can just go in and pulverize the Middle East and Central Asia and take over that key part of the grand chessboard and enforce a hundred-year American right on the world.
[01:37:01.279 --> 01:37:17.422]  Well, I mean, this is a nutty vision, and I think it's partly informed by the concern for Israel's continued expansion and ethnic cleansing on the part of some of these neoconservatives who I think are at least as interested in Israel's
[01:37:17.819 --> 01:37:18.681]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:37:31.525 --> 01:37:33.106]  The neocons want to go into Iran.
[01:37:33.146 --> 01:37:44.655]  That's stalling to a certain extent, though most experts agree they will attack it in the next year and perhaps take some buffer zone there on the western side of Iran, bordering Iraq, of course, where half the oil just so happens to reside.
[01:37:45.295 --> 01:37:53.281]  But a lot of experts I've talked to inside the military say no, the real attack is going to be on Syria, and now it looks like Israel, because this is a normal occurrence, kidnappings, killings.
[01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:57.502]  The military attacks going on both sides, ancient tribal warfare.
[01:37:57.522 --> 01:37:58.763]  I'm not defending either side.
[01:37:58.843 --> 01:38:01.044]  It's out of control, and it's being manipulated.
[01:38:01.704 --> 01:38:04.825]  But Israel's been creating fake al-Qaeda groups to escalate crises.
[01:38:05.165 --> 01:38:10.187]  Clearly they're hyping this up and trying to escalate it as a way to go into Syria, and they're trying to blame Syria right now.
[01:38:11.188 --> 01:38:11.688]  Well, that's true.
[01:38:12.168 --> 01:38:15.129]  And, you know, I try not to beat on Israel too much.
[01:38:15.309 --> 01:38:16.170]  You know, I'm a Muslim.
[01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:17.870]  I'm anti-Zionist.
[01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:20.411]  I don't think Israel ever should have been founded as a Jewish state.
[01:38:20.771 --> 01:38:27.013]  And I think it needs to be taken down and made into a state for all the people that live there, regardless of their ethnicity or religion.
[01:38:27.253 --> 01:38:30.094]  Well, it's been like that for 2,000 plus years.
[01:38:30.314 --> 01:38:31.835]  Well, no, it hasn't, Alex, actually.
[01:38:32.175 --> 01:38:35.796]  But the kind of state we have now in Israel... Sir, I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying.
[01:38:36.136 --> 01:38:36.356]  Okay.
[01:38:37.377 --> 01:38:44.602]  I'm saying going back to what it was, you know, pre-1940s, and the founding of Israel wasn't 47, 48.
[01:38:45.363 --> 01:38:56.811]  What I'm saying is that it was multicultural, multi-faith, going back to before Titus in 70 A.D., going back 2,500 years ago.
[01:38:57.352 --> 01:38:58.252]  Okay, I got you.
[01:38:58.493 --> 01:38:59.253]  You're absolutely right.
[01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:01.295]  Yeah, what I was trying to say was that...
[01:39:02.014 --> 01:39:06.855]  The Israel we have today is really the last outpost of European settler colonialism.
[01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:12.176]  You know how European settlers took over Algeria and turned the natives into peons.
[01:39:12.216 --> 01:39:13.876]  They did the same thing in southern Africa.
[01:39:13.916 --> 01:39:15.236]  They did the same thing in Kenya.
[01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:17.737]  And they've all been booted out of these places.
[01:39:17.897 --> 01:39:19.877]  Local people have taken back their own lands.
[01:39:20.297 --> 01:39:24.418]  And some of the Europeans choose to live on there as equal citizens with the local people.
[01:39:24.438 --> 01:39:30.119]  That's happened everywhere on the planet, except, of course, places like the Americas where there was genocide.
[01:39:31.366 --> 01:39:36.972]  And it hasn't happened in Israel-Palestine, and that's why Israel finds itself in an impossible position.
[01:39:36.992 --> 01:39:43.619]  It's trying to keep this settler colony going decades after the last settler colonies have folded up everywhere.
[01:39:43.639 --> 01:39:44.540]  Well, I want to make it clear.
[01:39:45.241 --> 01:39:46.762]  I've protested the Ku Klux Klan.
[01:39:46.802 --> 01:39:49.265]  I've been death-threatened, protested them over ten times.
[01:39:49.405 --> 01:39:50.867]  I've stood up against racist groups.
[01:39:51.633 --> 01:39:54.195]  And the ADL and others really are racist.
[01:39:54.235 --> 01:39:55.516]  They do slander people.
[01:39:56.156 --> 01:40:01.260]  And Israel really does have laws about Jews there can only marry Jews.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:13.369]  It's been in major newspapers, Israeli papers, that when say 10,000, 6,000 in different groups of Chinese workers come in, they have them sign a document swearing they won't date good Jewish girls.
[01:40:13.909 --> 01:40:23.392]  I mean, the last time we saw racial laws like this was in Nazi Germany, and I just wonder why the media and others never seem to point this out.
[01:40:24.112 --> 01:40:29.973]  Well, that's a good question, Alex, although I think we did actually see laws like that in South Africa after Nazi Germany.
[01:40:30.213 --> 01:40:32.434]  And in fact, that's where I think it's important to point out that
[01:40:32.887 --> 01:40:33.328]  We're good to go.
[01:40:33.368 --> 01:40:33.528]  I think?
[01:40:51.108 --> 01:40:52.349]  So you're right.
[01:40:52.649 --> 01:40:53.090]  I'm sick.
[01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.910]  I'm a Christian.
[01:40:54.311 --> 01:40:58.233]  And I'm sick of so-called liberals going, you Christians, George Bush, you crazy Christians.
[01:40:58.874 --> 01:41:01.836]  Hey, real Christians don't believe what George Bush believes.
[01:41:01.996 --> 01:41:04.398]  George Bush isn't a Christian.
[01:41:04.898 --> 01:41:11.363]  And so just like I don't appreciate people saying, and they do do this, that Jews are all bad.
[01:41:11.743 --> 01:41:14.805]  Just like they say Muslims are all bad or Christians are all bad.
[01:41:15.246 --> 01:41:16.827]  I personally am sick of it.
[01:41:16.867 --> 01:41:18.108]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:41:18.635 --> 01:41:32.107]  Yeah, what I'm saying is that what the Jews and Jews who are part of it are doing in Israel is exactly what French people were doing in Algeria and what Afrikaners of Dutch origin were doing in South Africa and what British settlers were doing in Kenya.
[01:41:32.147 --> 01:41:32.787]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:41:32.827 --> 01:41:39.373]  But I think the only difference is is it the Dutch in South Africa or the French on the Ivory Coast
[01:41:40.498 --> 01:41:40.999]  We're good to go.
[01:41:57.153 --> 01:42:01.456]  Yeah, well, from a Zionist perspective, that's of course true, that they're invoking a 2,000-year-old claim to that land.
[01:42:25.366 --> 01:42:35.072]  Other people would say that that's just about as rational as like having the Gypsies invoke a claim to Egypt, or maybe call them Romanies and have them invoke a claim to Romania.
[01:42:35.532 --> 01:42:49.700]  Oh no, oh no, it's true that there were many tribes in that area, and the sick thing about it, you know Israel, and this has come out in PNAC documents and come out in James Webber's quarterly, Israel and South Africa teamed up big time because they were apartheid states,
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:50.980]  We're good to go.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:51.360]  I think?
[01:43:13.007 --> 01:43:21.376]  And so the reality here is that if they had to drop the bioweapon move, the race specific, because it would have actually killed around 30% of Jews.
[01:43:22.096 --> 01:43:22.477]  That's right.
[01:43:22.497 --> 01:43:23.317]  I did read that, too.
[01:43:23.618 --> 01:43:32.146]  And I'll tell you, those horrific things that these South African scientists were doing really should give us pause and make us realize that we really need to change our way of life.
[01:43:32.186 --> 01:43:32.747]  We need to stop...
[01:43:33.114 --> 01:43:39.917]  Well, I would add that the mix that you have, the original populations of the Mediterranean are a mix of Central Asians who are Asian, who are Oriental, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:51.963 --> 01:44:13.865]  To boil it down, with some European migrants in the area, so it's really a hybrid population, and so even a lot of Americans who are of European descent, if these bioweapons are released, that's why they dropped it, they're trying to make it more specific, even a lot of Americans who aren't Jewish, but have any Native American background,
[01:44:14.845 --> 01:44:22.329]  may be killed by these because, believe it or not, the genetic strain in the Middle East is of the same bloodline as Native Americans.
[01:44:23.249 --> 01:44:23.689]  That's true.
[01:44:24.029 --> 01:44:38.095]  And I think that this whole idea of racialism, that it really matters, people fall into these genetic groups based on racial heritage that really mean something, I think that's a pretty dubious way of looking at the world.
[01:44:38.135 --> 01:44:40.056]  I think it makes more sense to think in terms of
[01:44:40.527 --> 01:44:43.268]  Ideas and practices and traditions and cultures.
[01:44:43.348 --> 01:44:44.089]  Oh, I agree with you.
[01:44:44.129 --> 01:44:53.273]  I'm just saying, you know, the Zionists come directly with an extreme racial identity setup.
[01:44:53.873 --> 01:44:55.034]  Right, and I don't buy into that.
[01:44:55.114 --> 01:45:00.397]  When they say that, oh, we have this racial identity and our racial forefathers had this land, I say, bunk.
[01:45:00.417 --> 01:45:01.257]  I don't think it matters.
[01:45:01.677 --> 01:45:04.479]  I don't care who lived in the land that you're on 2,000 years ago.
[01:45:04.539 --> 01:45:07.380]  You don't have the right to go there and ethnic cleanse the people who are living there.
[01:45:08.576 --> 01:45:28.908]  Well, I mean, you've studied this more than I, but there were some bad pockets of persecution on all sides, but predominantly Arabs, Muslims, Jews, Christians, especially Jews and Muslims, got along very well from Iraq to Iran to areas in the Mediterranean to right there in Jerusalem.
[01:45:29.608 --> 01:45:33.811]  Well, that's true, and part of the reason for that is that in the Islamic world in the past,
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:34.840]  I think so.
[01:45:50.723 --> 01:45:55.566]  And that's really why you have these different religions.
[01:45:55.626 --> 01:46:19.522]  But then Hitler came along, Professor, as you know, with the Muslim Brotherhood and moved into Tunis, moved into Egypt, moved into North Africa, moved into Iraq, and tried to radicalize the Muslims, and then afterwards the CIA took over and didn't like secular, mainline, strong Arab and Central Asian countries, and so they actually put radical Muslims into control.
[01:46:19.542 --> 01:46:20.223]  Were you aware of that?
[01:46:20.788 --> 01:46:22.871]  Well, yes, I am, although I don't think it started with Hitler.
[01:46:22.951 --> 01:46:27.596]  Actually, the British, in a way, started the process by moving into the Arabian Peninsula.
[01:46:27.616 --> 01:46:28.477]  With Turkey.
[01:46:28.657 --> 01:46:34.845]  Yeah, making an alliance with the Wahhabi-supported groups to rebel against Turkey.
[01:46:34.885 --> 01:46:36.607]  That goes back to Lawrence of Arabia.
[01:46:36.987 --> 01:46:37.468]  Exactly.
[01:46:37.728 --> 01:46:40.972]  So there's been this process of European colonial powers meddling.
[01:46:41.352 --> 01:46:43.933]  And, you know, pitting one group against the other group and messing around.
[01:46:44.093 --> 01:46:50.056]  But I would like to, you know, debunk this idea that the Muslim Brotherhood is basically a Nazi group.
[01:46:50.356 --> 01:46:54.398]  That idea has been put out by Zionist propaganda.
[01:46:54.458 --> 01:46:58.160]  I mean, it's like there's, you know, 20 companies with the name Federal in their name.
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:59.381]  I'm saying certain strains.
[01:46:59.904 --> 01:47:09.388]  Well, yeah, what it was was sort of a tactical alliance of, you know, your enemy is my enemy, you know, we're friends.
[01:47:09.908 --> 01:47:13.929]  In fact, that doesn't mean that people in the Muslim Brotherhood see the world even remotely.
[01:47:13.989 --> 01:47:14.670]  Well, that's right.
[01:47:14.690 --> 01:47:15.810]  I mean, Hitler invaded.
[01:47:15.850 --> 01:47:18.571]  He wasn't asking permission, so people rolled over, too.
[01:47:18.931 --> 01:47:19.231]  Right.
[01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:21.492]  I think I just did a bush on that quote.
[01:47:22.973 --> 01:47:23.513]  What is the quote?
[01:47:23.553 --> 01:47:25.154]  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[01:47:25.554 --> 01:47:25.734]  Right.
[01:47:26.074 --> 01:47:26.914]  Anyway, yeah.
[01:47:26.954 --> 01:47:28.615]  Nigeria is a very important continent.
[01:47:30.012 --> 01:47:30.432]  That's true.
[01:47:33.014 --> 01:47:34.015]  He's had a few of those, hasn't he?
[01:47:34.876 --> 01:47:38.119]  But getting back into 9-11, and I want to briefly, well, we've got a bunch of calls here.
[01:47:38.179 --> 01:47:38.780]  Let's just go to them.
[01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:41.482]  John in Michigan, you're on the air with the good doctor.
[01:47:41.502 --> 01:47:41.863]  Go ahead.
[01:47:42.203 --> 01:47:42.864]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:43.644 --> 01:47:45.906]  That's a great conversation there.
[01:47:46.427 --> 01:47:47.248]  That's a good premise.
[01:47:47.708 --> 01:47:49.550]  I did order Terror Storm just the other day.
[01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:50.651]  Thank you.
[01:47:51.113 --> 01:47:56.274]  And I got at least five copies of Painful Deceptions going out all over America, too.
[01:47:56.594 --> 01:47:57.715]  Good.
[01:47:58.175 --> 01:47:59.515]  So, I mean, I'm doing my part.
[01:47:59.675 --> 01:48:04.256]  I mean, are you familiar with David Barton's ministry in Texas?
[01:48:05.237 --> 01:48:06.477]  I don't believe I am.
[01:48:06.917 --> 01:48:07.197]  Okay.
[01:48:07.337 --> 01:48:09.438]  Well, just wallbuilders.com at some point.
[01:48:10.098 --> 01:48:10.718]  Oh, I am, yes.
[01:48:10.938 --> 01:48:11.718]  Okay, yeah.
[01:48:11.998 --> 01:48:12.998]  That's an excellent ministry.
[01:48:13.038 --> 01:48:15.059]  And then are you familiar with Dr. Kent Hovind, too?
[01:48:16.378 --> 01:48:16.898]  You know what?
[01:48:16.958 --> 01:48:17.359]  I'm not.
[01:48:18.019 --> 01:48:19.580]  He'd be a great guest.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:19.720]  Sure.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.101]  Do you have any questions or comments for our guests?
[01:48:22.181 --> 01:48:24.863]  Oh, well, I heard that comment.
[01:48:25.103 --> 01:48:27.764]  See, what we're doing now is we're just attaching adjectives to everything.
[01:48:27.844 --> 01:48:29.985]  Paleo-conservative versus neoconservative.
[01:48:30.645 --> 01:48:36.208]  And I just think that's an absolute great point because we live in a day and age now where we have to define Christianity.
[01:48:36.248 --> 01:48:42.672]  We have to say biblical Christianity because all the mainstream denominations have gone apostate away from the Bible in one form or another.
[01:48:42.752 --> 01:48:45.013]  Like you have a pro-choice Catholic
[01:48:45.612 --> 01:48:51.295]  You look at a guy like Sean Hannity and all these guys, all these professing Catholics, the fact of the matter is, just like he said, they're not Christians.
[01:48:51.775 --> 01:48:55.877]  They're not biblical Christians because a biblical Christian is a separated person.
[01:48:56.077 --> 01:48:58.898]  Okay, I hear you and I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:48:58.918 --> 01:48:59.279]  I really do.
[01:48:59.319 --> 01:49:03.020]  We're going to come back and take a few more calls from Leslie and others for our guest.
[01:49:03.661 --> 01:49:08.543]  And, Doctor, why don't you give people the website for your organization that you had?
[01:49:09.167 --> 01:49:11.530]  Yeah, I edit for Mujka.com.
[01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:15.093]  That's the Muslim-Jewish-Christian Alliance for 9-11 Truth.
[01:49:15.554 --> 01:49:24.083]  That's M-U-J-C-A dot com, and you can Google up Muslim-Jewish-Christian 9-11, and you'll get there real fast.
[01:49:25.184 --> 01:49:31.151]  And right now we have a link to it on Infowars.com on the main page for people that missed it or weren't aware of it.
[01:49:31.872 --> 01:49:32.653]  Be sure and visit it.
[01:49:32.693 --> 01:49:33.673]  It's a good organization.
[01:49:34.193 --> 01:49:37.735]  Just getting people past all the politics and getting down and exposing 9-11.
[01:49:38.076 --> 01:49:38.996]  We're all in this together.
[01:49:39.036 --> 01:49:41.097]  The globalists are not Christians, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:41.478 --> 01:49:42.438]  I want to restate that.
[01:49:42.478 --> 01:49:47.021]  George Bush, when he really engages in religious activity, he worships Lucifer.
[01:49:47.461 --> 01:49:48.622]  And you know I don't make stuff up.
[01:49:48.662 --> 01:49:49.582]  We've made films about it.
[01:49:49.602 --> 01:49:50.343]  We've infiltrated it.
[01:49:50.703 --> 01:49:51.043]  It's true.
[01:49:53.183 --> 01:50:00.026]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.326 --> 01:50:01.706]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:01.886 --> 01:50:04.107]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.247 --> 01:50:06.328]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[01:50:28.819 --> 01:50:30.720]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:52:54.327 --> 01:53:00.289]  It's the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:03.751]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:06.712]  Dr. Kevin Barrett is our guest.
[01:53:07.324 --> 01:53:09.305]  We have links to his website up on Infowars.com.
[01:53:09.685 --> 01:53:11.785]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls for our guests.
[01:53:11.805 --> 01:53:13.286]  I appreciate joining us.
[01:53:14.406 --> 01:53:19.767]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joy in Hawaii.
[01:53:19.887 --> 01:53:20.927]  Joy, you're on the air.
[01:53:20.987 --> 01:53:21.348]  Welcome.
[01:53:22.088 --> 01:53:23.128]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:23.228 --> 01:53:26.729]  I mostly had a question for you about this 9-0-1-1 thing.
[01:53:26.789 --> 01:53:32.550]  One of the things that I'm concerned about or wondering about, I can believe the demolition.
[01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:34.991]  I can believe everything that you're saying, but
[01:53:35.327 --> 01:53:45.052]  I'm wondering, how do you answer someone when they ask you, well, what about Flight 93 and Todd Beamer and Let's Roll and the mothers talking to their sons being interviewed on CNN?
[01:53:45.072 --> 01:53:47.093]  Let me tell you how you answer that.
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:50.901]  Number one, it's been scientifically tested.
[01:53:51.422 --> 01:53:57.005]  Cell phones do not work above 2,000 feet, you know, flying at 300 miles an hour.
[01:53:57.485 --> 01:53:58.066]  I've tested it.
[01:53:58.086 --> 01:53:59.267]  Everybody I know has tested it.
[01:53:59.287 --> 01:54:00.968]  But scientists have tested it.
[01:54:01.048 --> 01:54:03.769]  Everyone knows, even now they're trying to develop the technology.
[01:54:03.789 --> 01:54:06.911]  Everybody knows that five years ago it never worked.
[01:54:06.971 --> 01:54:07.592]  It didn't work.
[01:54:07.832 --> 01:54:09.473]  They're not saying those were air phones.
[01:54:10.153 --> 01:54:10.753]  We're good to go.
[01:54:35.393 --> 01:54:36.094]  We're good to go.
[01:54:55.299 --> 01:54:57.160]  Number two, we know they really shot down Flight 93.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.762]  It had an eight and a half mile debris field.
[01:55:00.322 --> 01:55:00.703]  Okay?
[01:55:01.283 --> 01:55:02.284]  We have that on record.
[01:55:02.324 --> 01:55:04.545]  And Rumsfeld slipped up twice and said they shot it down.
[01:55:05.005 --> 01:55:06.246]  And so that's theater.
[01:55:06.326 --> 01:55:07.827]  It's just like the fat bin Laden in 2002.
[01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:09.949]  They did a voice print.
[01:55:10.009 --> 01:55:10.949]  It wasn't bin Laden.
[01:55:11.269 --> 01:55:12.670]  The face wasn't bin Laden.
[01:55:12.850 --> 01:55:14.011]  He didn't even look like him.
[01:55:14.051 --> 01:55:15.192]  Linguists listened to the voice.
[01:55:15.272 --> 01:55:16.733]  It wasn't the same dialect.
[01:55:17.093 --> 01:55:18.214]  It's totally fake.
[01:55:18.234 --> 01:55:20.475]  These are people that manufacture fake evidence.
[01:55:20.515 --> 01:55:21.336]  Doctor, you want to comment?
[01:55:22.122 --> 01:55:23.624]  Well, I totally agree with you, Alex.
[01:55:23.684 --> 01:55:28.210]  As far as the cell phone calls go, it looks to me like those had to have been fake.
[01:55:28.570 --> 01:55:37.522]  And I have looked fairly closely at that fake confession video from December 2001, and it's pretty bizarre that the government is still waving that in our face.
[01:55:38.092 --> 01:55:41.574]  As the smoking gun proving that there was some link between us on Bin Laden and 9-11.
[01:55:41.695 --> 01:55:49.660]  Yeah, Bin Laden suddenly gains 100 pounds, and they take real Bin Laden tapes, make a voice key, then you try to run that Bin Laden's voice through a voice print key.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:50.580]  It doesn't work.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:50.761]  It's 100%.
[01:55:51.941 --> 01:55:53.662]  Major universities have studied it, ma'am.
[01:55:53.702 --> 01:55:54.243]  It's not real.
[01:55:54.903 --> 01:55:57.525]  Okay, now what about, that's a good answer.
[01:55:57.785 --> 01:56:00.647]  What about the planes that went into the Twin Towers?
[01:56:00.767 --> 01:56:03.469]  If they were American and United Airlines planes,
[01:56:04.019 --> 01:56:08.242]  Or if they were military planes, would it look like there was bombs on the bottom of them?
[01:56:08.623 --> 01:56:13.326]  So if they were military planes going into the buildings, then what happened to those two flights?
[01:56:13.406 --> 01:56:20.091]  Well, ma'am, the media loves to give attention to belly bombs and stuff like that because we can debate it for a thousand years, okay?
[01:56:20.512 --> 01:56:26.576]  If you look at CIA insider trading, NORAD standing down, PNAC saying they needed terror attacks to get their agenda.
[01:56:26.957 --> 01:56:31.860]  If you look at Cheney in the bunker controlling the operation, the supposed hijackers trained at U.S.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:32.661]  military bases.
[01:56:32.981 --> 01:56:40.807]  You look at all of that, then you prove the government was running the attacks, then all the minutia, they're not going to tell us because they're the criminals that carried it out.
[01:56:41.147 --> 01:56:43.169]  We need to arrest them and bring them in for questioning.
[01:56:43.409 --> 01:56:44.750]  We need to get all those files.
[01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:48.733]  But we know, then we know that it just goes on and on, ma'am.
[01:56:49.727 --> 01:56:51.088]  Yeah, I could add something there, Alex.
[01:56:51.328 --> 01:56:51.769]  Sure.
[01:56:52.049 --> 01:57:09.444]  Yeah, actually, back in 1962, as you know, there was something called Operation Northwoods, which was a plan drafted by Lemnister, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and signed off on by every member of the Joint Chiefs to provoke a war with Cuba by blowing people up in American cities and staging a fake jetliner shoot-down.
[01:57:09.824 --> 01:57:11.886]  Now, that jetliner was going to be loaded with 200 CIA agents,
[01:57:14.464 --> 01:57:19.228]  Playing the role of college students under carefully developed aliases, that is, non-existent people.
[01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:21.330]  And they were going to do a fake shoot-down.
[01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:22.271]  The plane would land.
[01:57:22.411 --> 01:57:23.792]  A military drone would cross paths.
[01:57:23.812 --> 01:57:25.974]  Professor, do you want to stay five more minutes and finish?
[01:57:26.575 --> 01:57:27.335]  Oh, sure.
[01:57:27.896 --> 01:57:28.697]  Ma'am, just stay there.
[01:57:28.717 --> 01:57:29.698]  We're going to answer your questions.
[01:57:30.698 --> 01:57:31.319]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.461 --> 01:57:37.685]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[01:57:49.557 --> 01:57:50.178]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.858 --> 01:57:51.919]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.619 --> 01:57:53.720]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:55.181]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.961 --> 01:57:56.842]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.862 --> 01:58:01.205]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.705 --> 01:58:05.808]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:08.249]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:58:08.289 --> 01:58:12.212]  We're here live already in the third hour on this Thursday, the 13th edition of July.
[01:58:14.258 --> 01:58:20.020]  Coming up, we're going to be talking about the American Union and how the Canadians are fighting back against it more than the people in the U.S.
[01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:29.083]  Right now, we are joined by the founder of the Muslim-Jewish Christian Alliance for 9-11 Truth, Dr. Kevin Barrett.
[01:58:29.864 --> 01:58:36.066]  We were talking to a lady out of Hawaii with the classic questions of how the cell phone calls, and then you look at the evidence that those are fake.
[01:58:36.526 --> 01:58:39.447]  Then you ask, well, how did they stage these planes flying into buildings?
[01:58:40.436 --> 01:58:41.377]  We have an official U.S.
[01:58:41.417 --> 01:58:47.080]  government document where they say they'll stage a fake manifest of CIA agents getting on a plane.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:52.383]  It takes off and lands, a plane with the same tail numbers, painted up the same, is blown up.
[01:58:52.783 --> 01:58:58.567]  Then they issue a list of young people that are dead, and the government says, young people really, you know, that gets people real mad.
[01:58:58.827 --> 01:58:59.547]  It says all that.
[01:59:00.388 --> 01:59:00.788]  Right.
[01:59:00.828 --> 01:59:02.409]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:59:04.298 --> 01:59:13.428]  Yeah, the plane business on 9-11 is pretty mysterious, but we do have that precedent for some kind of a plane switcheroo that they were planning in Operation Northwest.
[01:59:13.448 --> 01:59:23.158]  It's very odd that the occupancy on those four planes on 9-11 was down around 25%, whereas on all the other cross-continental flights... Almost 90%.
[01:59:23.979 --> 01:59:24.479]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:25.841]  It was actually 21%, yeah.
[01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:28.671]  Yeah, why were they so empty?
[01:59:29.372 --> 01:59:45.745]  By the way, it was Air Force pilots who just so happened to go to work for the airlines who'd run drills the year before flying planes into Pentagon, and then that's the pilot supposedly piloting the plane that hits the Pentagon, and there's all these CIA people.
[01:59:46.145 --> 01:59:48.687]  Oh, all these government people just so happened to die on the flight.
[01:59:48.767 --> 01:59:49.828]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:59:50.028 --> 01:59:56.694]  Yeah, it's a pretty bad story to have the guy who was the pilot in the test to fly a plane into the Pentagon.
[01:59:57.014 --> 02:00:08.224]  Be the guy who gets hijacked, and then a guy who can't fly a Cessna supposedly takes over and flies it all the way back from Ohio and finds his way into the Pentagon by doing a stunt maneuver.
[02:00:08.244 --> 02:00:10.726]  I mean, it's pretty bad script writing.
[02:00:11.606 --> 02:00:14.088]  Well, I'll tell you what fits the facts we know.
[02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:17.071]  We know the supposed hijackers were really U.S.
[02:00:17.111 --> 02:00:25.218]  government agents who thought they were taking part in live-action drills, and it looks like the pilot of whatever plane took off that they claim at the Pentagon, wherever it went,
[02:00:25.971 --> 02:00:29.373]  ...was probably killed or was sheet-dipped, and they staged deaths all the time.
[02:00:29.413 --> 02:00:30.333]  That's declassified.
[02:00:30.353 --> 02:00:34.375]  You know, either way, it just shows that all of these were, quote, live-action drills.
[02:00:35.296 --> 02:00:35.716]  That's right.
[02:00:35.916 --> 02:00:40.298]  Yeah, it seems like that's how they usually do it with these false-flag terror attacks.
[02:00:40.358 --> 02:00:44.840]  They take a drill, and they make it go live, just like on 7-7 when we heard from Peter Piper.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.481]  I'm sorry, Peter, what's his name?
[02:00:46.501 --> 02:00:47.081]  Peter Power.
[02:00:47.422 --> 02:00:48.742]  Peter Power is Peter Piper.
[02:00:48.762 --> 02:00:54.445]  Yeah, Peter Power, right about the same day, came out and said, Oh, that's funny, you know, these bombs that just went off.
[02:00:54.725 --> 02:01:00.569]  That's exactly the place and the time of these bombs that we were, you know, fake bombs that we were going to set off in a terror drill.
[02:01:00.689 --> 02:01:02.090]  And we need an actuary on that.
[02:01:02.130 --> 02:01:04.572]  It's over 300 Tractor Gillian chance for that to happen.
[02:01:04.852 --> 02:01:05.532]  It's impossible.
[02:01:05.552 --> 02:01:07.213]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:01:07.514 --> 02:01:09.595]  Let's jam one more call in here real quick, and I've got to let you go.
[02:01:09.635 --> 02:01:10.996]  It's been great having you on.
[02:01:11.036 --> 02:01:12.557]  Let's talk to Leslie in Virginia.
[02:01:12.597 --> 02:01:13.338]  Leslie, go ahead.
[02:01:14.238 --> 02:01:15.479]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:15.679 --> 02:01:22.804]  Alex Jones has interviewed Jerome Corsi several times, and I don't know if you're aware of this, but the hostility toward you that was shown on Fox News...
[02:01:24.035 --> 02:01:33.026]  Most likely was attributed to Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation, and the other CBS and Disney, and they were to submit the bids to Univision.
[02:01:33.066 --> 02:01:34.909]  We're talking about billions of dollars here.
[02:01:34.929 --> 02:01:35.790]  Okay, I'm ignorant.
[02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:38.132]  What are you... I mean, I'm kind of missing it.
[02:01:38.152 --> 02:01:38.813]  What's going on?
[02:01:38.893 --> 02:01:41.517]  Okay, what it is, if they give credit...
[02:01:41.957 --> 02:01:42.717]  We're good to go.
[02:01:42.757 --> 02:01:43.077]  I think?
[02:02:05.256 --> 02:02:09.518]  They're running this thing to a freight train, and that's why all the hostility towards them.
[02:02:09.578 --> 02:02:12.319]  I was just thinking maybe this is a... Okay, listen, I've got to go.
[02:02:12.399 --> 02:02:13.120]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.220]  Doctor, it was wonderful having you on.
[02:02:15.241 --> 02:02:16.821]  I hope to have you up in the near future again.
[02:02:16.841 --> 02:02:18.522]  I'd love to come back, Alex.
[02:02:18.742 --> 02:02:19.262]  I love your show.
[02:02:19.302 --> 02:02:19.963]  Keep up the good work.
[02:02:20.143 --> 02:02:20.823]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:02:20.863 --> 02:02:21.623]  You keep up the good work.
[02:02:21.663 --> 02:02:23.584]  Dr. Kevin Barrett, we appreciate you joining us.
[02:02:23.604 --> 02:02:26.666]  All right, we'll be right back with our next guest getting into the American Union.
[02:02:26.686 --> 02:02:27.806]  You do not want to miss this.
[02:02:27.826 --> 02:02:33.889]  We'll give you all the latest updates and info on how they're fighting it north of the United States, up in...
[02:02:34.651 --> 02:02:35.191]  Canada.
[02:02:36.011 --> 02:02:37.932]  All that and a lot more on the other side.
[02:02:38.012 --> 02:02:39.653]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[02:02:39.913 --> 02:02:40.373]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.014 --> 02:02:53.417]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.677 --> 02:02:58.418]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.618 --> 02:03:04.280]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:09.041]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.261 --> 02:03:16.404]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.444 --> 02:03:20.965]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.125 --> 02:03:23.626]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:23.866 --> 02:03:30.588]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:30.808 --> 02:03:36.070]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:36.090 --> 02:03:36.510]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.177 --> 02:03:48.458]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.518 --> 02:03:52.699]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:55.720]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.321]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.521 --> 02:04:07.144]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.344 --> 02:04:08.685]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:08.885 --> 02:04:13.046]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.106 --> 02:04:13.807]  We're good to go.
[02:04:32.329 --> 02:04:35.091]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:35.111 --> 02:04:36.031]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.717 --> 02:04:48.859]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[02:04:49.119 --> 02:04:55.924]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[02:04:56.364 --> 02:05:09.713]  For example, did you know that Live 52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[02:05:10.033 --> 02:05:13.476]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[02:05:14.107 --> 02:05:14.407]  Thank you.
[02:05:45.962 --> 02:05:51.587]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.468 --> 02:06:08.801]  There are thousands of facets to the American Union, which will then be merged into the Pan-American Union, encompassing all of Latin America, from Chile to Alaska, the Caribbean Islands, and even into the Pacific.
[02:06:10.983 --> 02:06:13.605]  And we are joined by Connie Fogel.
[02:06:14.392 --> 02:06:29.703]  She's written a great article, The Bell Tolls for Canada, and she is the head of the Canadian Action Party, and they're going to make it their main central platform issue to defend the sovereignty of Canada.
[02:06:31.043 --> 02:06:32.524]  And yes, we've gotten down to this point.
[02:06:32.564 --> 02:06:39.029]  I remember three or four years ago reading big Canadian newspapers admitting, American Union, the deals are being signed, it's happening, we're losing our sovereignty.
[02:06:39.679 --> 02:06:41.060]  You didn't see that in Mexico, though.
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:41.521]  They love it.
[02:06:41.541 --> 02:06:43.142]  They're run by Chase Manhattan and Citibank.
[02:06:43.503 --> 02:06:44.764]  Never saw it in our newspapers.
[02:06:44.824 --> 02:06:46.105]  Now you're seeing it in our newspapers.
[02:06:46.145 --> 02:06:48.347]  Now you're hearing Lou Dobbs and others talk about it.
[02:06:49.148 --> 02:06:52.631]  And so, Connie Fogle, thank you for joining us from Canada.
[02:06:53.012 --> 02:06:54.593]  Tell us about the Canadian Action Party.
[02:06:54.613 --> 02:06:55.474]  Tell us about yourself.
[02:06:55.754 --> 02:06:57.596]  Tell us about this fight you're weighing in on.
[02:06:58.497 --> 02:07:02.200]  Well, thank you very much for having me on your show.
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:03.762]  I really appreciate the opportunity.
[02:07:04.968 --> 02:07:30.079]  I know a number of Canadian listeners to your show over the years have told me that I should try to get on your show and I'm just so grateful that somebody connected with you and then you connected with me and I'm here because I'm told that you have a pretty respectable audience right from Canada and it's been the difficulty of the Canadian Action Party as one of Canada's few small parties
[02:07:31.422 --> 02:07:33.543]  To get exposure.
[02:07:34.823 --> 02:07:37.104]  Well, we're glad that you're out there fighting for your sovereignty.
[02:07:37.624 --> 02:07:40.345]  Tell us about the party and some of the issues you've been involved in.
[02:07:40.365 --> 02:07:43.106]  And now let's get into this American Union.
[02:07:43.326 --> 02:07:50.229]  Yeah, the Canadian Action Party began in 1997 and has been in, I think it's four elections now in Canada.
[02:07:50.989 --> 02:07:58.472]  And it was a party that came into existence with the first leader, who was a former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada by the name of Paul Hillier.
[02:08:00.133 --> 02:08:11.420]  Who had a primary platform of concern about the power of money, the sovereignty of money, and whoever controls the money in your nation controls the nation.
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:16.783]  It doesn't matter who's actually there in government because the power strings are pulled by those who control money.
[02:08:16.823 --> 02:08:20.445]  You're talking about the Bank of Canada, the central bank, who controls that?
[02:08:20.585 --> 02:08:21.006]  That's right.
[02:08:21.746 --> 02:08:23.787]  Same as our Federal Reserve.
[02:08:23.848 --> 02:08:26.109]  Well, it's different because your Federal Reserve is private.
[02:08:26.209 --> 02:08:27.130]  Our bank is public.
[02:08:29.206 --> 02:08:49.137]  The second prong of the party's concern always has been a concern about sovereignty, independence, which basically has, as you know, the principle is the right to make your decisions in your own area the way you want it, rather than being dictated to by something or somebody else.
[02:08:51.299 --> 02:08:56.902]  So the second prong was a concern about the growing corporatization of the world,
[02:08:57.392 --> 02:09:08.062]  And its impact on Canada, and of course it's exemplified in the Free Trade Agreement and the NAFTA Agreement, which has been the vehicle of economic domination and control of Canada and the removal of our economic sovereignty.
[02:09:08.563 --> 02:09:11.866]  Those were our primary platforms and have always been the
[02:09:15.149 --> 02:09:22.994]  Well, Connie Fogel, break down what the North American Union is to be expanded into the American Union and then the Pan-American Union.
[02:09:23.414 --> 02:09:25.436]  Break down the reportage you've seen in Canada.
[02:09:25.456 --> 02:09:28.137]  I've actually seen more there than I have here, though it's still not enough.
[02:09:28.558 --> 02:09:35.202]  And then the concerns Canadians have and how this will affect you and how your population is being sold on this right now.
[02:09:36.082 --> 02:09:42.184]  I mean, it's interesting you say what you say, because I think there's been more information coming up from the states than there has been in Canada about it.
[02:09:42.244 --> 02:09:47.466]  You may have missed the Toronto Star and a bunch of other articles that came out a few years ago and then last year.
[02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:51.727]  Yeah, well, there are snippets of things in various... Now, the Toronto Star doesn't cover the country, you see.
[02:09:52.067 --> 02:09:54.468]  It's not a major paper that goes right across the country.
[02:09:54.508 --> 02:09:56.289]  It serves the Toronto area primarily.
[02:09:57.509 --> 02:10:04.432]  So our major mainstream papers do not, have not been covering any... There will be little snippets somewhere, somewhere that's significant that everybody misses it.
[02:10:04.472 --> 02:10:05.392]  The majority of people miss it.
[02:10:06.342 --> 02:10:26.531]  I, in this, just before the last election we had, which was held in January of 2006, a number of articles before that, a number of months before that, I began doing research because of information I was receiving about this North American Union, this Pan-American concept, and put together an article which is called The Metamorphosis and Sabotage of Canada by Our Own Government.
[02:10:27.151 --> 02:10:30.793]  It's on the Canadian Action Party website, canadianactionparty.ca.
[02:10:32.172 --> 02:10:36.055]  And basically, I mean, it wasn't very hard to find the information.
[02:10:36.075 --> 02:10:50.524]  I had a few other people helping me go to the various websites, government websites, the websites of the corporate elite, to learn what is being done to us.
[02:10:51.184 --> 02:10:56.928]  And that became the major platform in the election that we've just had, and mostly
[02:10:57.714 --> 02:11:02.700]  Because we're so small, we don't get the exposure, and most people, I'm sorry to say, don't know what's going on.
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:04.562]  That's why I'm grateful to be on your show.
[02:11:04.843 --> 02:11:13.233]  People who listen to your show do know, and it's the whole business of getting more and more information out to the masses so that they can understand what's happening to us.
[02:11:13.814 --> 02:11:15.556]  Well, let me be clear, though.
[02:11:16.389 --> 02:11:26.397]  I have spent hours every couple days studying the American Union, reading the government websites, reading the news reports about it, and I learn more every day.
[02:11:26.457 --> 02:11:29.739]  So to even say this audience is informed, I'm not informed.
[02:11:30.159 --> 02:11:36.384]  I'm informed more than most people who are informed on this issue, but my point is this thing runs dark and deep.
[02:11:36.664 --> 02:11:37.245]  You're right.
[02:11:37.265 --> 02:11:41.548]  You know, this black ocean of wickedness that we're witnessing.
[02:11:41.588 --> 02:11:53.718]  So impart to us the knowledge you have, in case it's something we're not aware of, of how this is going to interface with Mexico, Canada, and the U.S., and what your strategy is to try to combat this.
[02:11:53.998 --> 02:11:54.198]  Okay.
[02:11:54.659 --> 02:12:05.167]  Well, you know, we spent time learning about the two major agreements, the first one being the Smart Border Declaration, which happened in 2001 by a Deputy Prime Minister of Canada and the
[02:12:05.535 --> 02:12:15.283]  And of your Homeland Security, which basically began the parameters of extending this union of North America from the Economic Master Plan, which was set out in the NAFTA agreement.
[02:12:16.104 --> 02:12:20.867]  It's extended into the military and into the legal system, into the policing system, into immigration.
[02:12:21.548 --> 02:12:31.376]  And it was there in December of 2001 that they agreed that both countries, in particular, are going to focus on Canada and the United States.
[02:12:32.388 --> 02:12:45.896]  would bring in anti-terrorist legislation, which was to be the mechanism to control the population as the introduction of this new restructuring was to unfold.
[02:12:47.257 --> 02:12:57.303]  Even their own language, when you read the reports on the websites of the chief corporate executives of North America, they acknowledge and confirm that
[02:12:58.110 --> 02:13:03.613]  The implementation of a unification of this entire area has to be done incrementally, and that's what they're doing.
[02:13:04.053 --> 02:13:16.440]  Unfortunately, our legislators don't read enough, don't pay attention enough, just accept what's put in front of them in the bits and pieces, and we end up with actual law in our country that is harmful to the citizens.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:23.964]  The second important significant agreement is the Security and Prosperity Partnership Agreement, which came...
[02:13:24.617 --> 02:13:48.238]  ...into existence by the three leaders of our three countries, Canada, the United States, and Mexico, in March of 2005, whereby they basically agreed to expand the agenda of the North American corporate military elite into this restructuring of North America and created committees, and they agreed that in each country would have three major...
[02:13:50.705 --> 02:13:58.388]  Cabinet ministers, ministers of the highest level of government, whose job it would be to effect the implementation process.
[02:13:59.048 --> 02:14:13.694]  And what's significant, I'll just give you an interesting little aside here, the three people who were Canada's implementers, two of whom did not get re-elected in the January election in Canada,
[02:14:14.333 --> 02:14:14.893]  One did.
[02:14:14.913 --> 02:14:43.805]  He was running for the Liberal Party, which lost its majority, and the party that did get the majority in our minority government is a conservative, and this third person, named David Emerson, walked across before they were even on the floor, before the parliament even reconvened, was invited to join the conservative party, which he did, and he is now a cabinet minister there in the opposite party, and now in that party, and he was aghast that his
[02:14:44.451 --> 02:14:45.111]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:45.131 --> 02:14:46.372]  I mean, let's get down to brass tacks.
[02:14:46.392 --> 02:14:47.552]  In early June, the Bilderberg Group,
[02:15:11.050 --> 02:15:13.473]  I was there in Ottawa, in your capital.
[02:15:13.533 --> 02:15:14.073]  I went there.
[02:15:14.093 --> 02:15:15.915]  Right, I know all about that and what happened to you.
[02:15:16.096 --> 02:15:17.337]  Yeah, I was grilled.
[02:15:17.357 --> 02:15:18.819]  It was hellish.
[02:15:18.839 --> 02:15:22.783]  They grabbed Canadian citizens and took them to facilities and threatened to cut their arms off.
[02:15:23.364 --> 02:15:24.245]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[02:15:24.285 --> 02:15:25.446]  Yes, I read about it.
[02:15:25.466 --> 02:15:25.726]  I mean, it's...
[02:15:26.997 --> 02:15:33.979]  So can you, I mean, as a Canadian and the head of your party, can you specifically talk about your views on what's happening with your border police?
[02:15:34.039 --> 02:15:44.523]  And here's this international group who admittedly is pushing and behind the American Union, and there they are with your own government guarding them and treating your own citizens and visitors like trash.
[02:15:45.203 --> 02:15:45.503]  I know.
[02:15:45.583 --> 02:15:46.224]  It's outrageous.
[02:15:46.284 --> 02:15:47.004]  It's wrong.
[02:15:47.104 --> 02:15:55.687]  And I have to tell you that we're the only party, we're one of the small, small parties in Canada, but we're the only ones that are taking this stuff on, trying to profile it, trying to...
[02:15:56.181 --> 02:15:57.082]  Yeah, denial is not a river.
[02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.671]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:16:20.691 --> 02:16:21.311]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:16:45.406 --> 02:17:00.419]  But they're not laughing as much now because it is in the news now that we are going into an American Union and that security and prosperity partnership has been signed and our federal agencies respectively are merging without any legislation in your parliament or in our congress.
[02:17:00.439 --> 02:17:00.819]  Exactly.
[02:17:00.859 --> 02:17:05.102]  I mean, they're acting totally beyond and outside of and contrary to our constitutions.
[02:17:05.683 --> 02:17:08.145]  It is technically, you know, illegal.
[02:17:09.304 --> 02:17:17.009]  And it's something that I want to look at via another group that I'm part of, the Defense of Canadian Liberty.
[02:17:17.350 --> 02:17:18.250]  I'm here in Toronto.
[02:17:18.391 --> 02:17:19.011]  We've got a break.
[02:17:19.051 --> 02:17:20.592]  We'll come back and continue with that.
[02:17:20.832 --> 02:17:22.494]  I know we've got a bunch of callers we'll go to.
[02:17:22.634 --> 02:17:23.354]  You'll be all over the map.
[02:17:23.394 --> 02:17:23.835]  That's fine.
[02:17:24.555 --> 02:17:27.578]  I'm just talking to the callers out there.
[02:17:27.598 --> 02:17:29.640]  We're going to be all over the map, but that's okay.
[02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:31.402]  And we're going to be taking more of your calls.
[02:17:31.462 --> 02:17:36.988]  If you're calling in from Canada, you'll get preferential treatment because we want to get you to the front of the line to get your take on all this.

[02:18:47.532 --> 02:18:48.574]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.974 --> 02:18:54.461]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.042 --> 02:18:55.543]  That's right.
[02:18:55.843 --> 02:18:58.146]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.466 --> 02:19:05.616]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.169 --> 02:19:13.875]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.316 --> 02:19:19.120]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.779 --> 02:19:24.804]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.605 --> 02:19:29.729]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.350]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.370 --> 02:19:32.312]  Make sure that you secure your future.

[02:20:45.971 --> 02:20:51.772]  September 11th, 2001 changed the world, and the world is now realizing that the official story of that infamous day just doesn't make sense.
[02:20:52.093 --> 02:20:56.474]  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that there is a government cover-up, according to a CNN poll.
[02:20:56.494 --> 02:20:57.914]  9-11 in plain sight.
[02:20:57.954 --> 02:21:05.536]  The director's cut is a compilation of unaltered news footage and photos from major networks and publications that raises questions that officials dare not ask, let alone answer.
[02:21:05.916 --> 02:21:13.838]  The worldwide firestorm of questions raised has forced some into a position of desperation damage control to keep this documentary from being seen or accepted by the masses.
[02:21:14.378 --> 02:21:14.738]  We're good to go.
[02:21:45.882 --> 02:21:51.026]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:51.706 --> 02:21:54.048]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:58.711 --> 02:22:01.814]  Connie Fogel's our guest.
[02:22:02.334 --> 02:22:04.195]  She heads up the Canadian Action Party.
[02:22:04.215 --> 02:22:05.456]  It's a serious party up there.
[02:22:06.137 --> 02:22:07.698]  Has a lot of prominent people involved in it.
[02:22:09.563 --> 02:22:21.853]  Imagine, you have to tune into this show or read a few news articles or maybe catch it on Lou Dobbs to hear openly the deals have been signed, the agreements are going through, our governments are being merged, Social Security for Mexicans, I'm sure you've heard that.
[02:22:22.374 --> 02:22:25.316]  That's a small part of that, those little announcements you hear.
[02:22:25.957 --> 02:22:26.997]  Mexicans in Mexico.
[02:22:28.359 --> 02:22:29.940]  It's happening, the end of our country.
[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:36.665]  And under these regional governorships and these nine-member boards, three members from Canada, the U.S.
[02:22:36.685 --> 02:22:37.206]  and Mexico,
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:39.981]  We lose control.
[02:22:40.021 --> 02:22:41.102]  We lose our due process.
[02:22:41.142 --> 02:22:42.143]  We lose our Bill of Rights.
[02:22:42.543 --> 02:22:44.304]  The Canadians lose many of their freedoms.
[02:22:44.684 --> 02:22:45.465]  The Mexicans do.
[02:22:45.545 --> 02:22:47.046]  I mean, this is really happening.
[02:22:47.687 --> 02:22:49.648]  And ask yourselves, why isn't it bigger news?
[02:22:49.668 --> 02:22:56.393]  I mean, we celebrate that it's finally being admitted, but still it's like an open secret or something.
[02:22:56.874 --> 02:22:59.956]  Connie, I want to continue and have you for the whole hour, but let's go to some calls right now.
[02:23:00.636 --> 02:23:03.038]  Tim in Alberta, Canada, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:23:03.058 --> 02:23:03.418]  Go ahead.
[02:23:05.020 --> 02:23:08.142]  Good to hear some other Canadians are doing some stuff, too.
[02:23:09.028 --> 02:23:11.959]  Just a quick question for Alex.
[02:23:12.099 --> 02:23:13.846]  Are you flying your flag upside down yet?
[02:23:15.358 --> 02:23:28.001]  No, I was too busy defending the United States part-time, even on the 4th of July, to actually even have a flag flying or to fly it upside down.
[02:23:28.041 --> 02:23:30.142]  I was too busy actually defending the spirit of a flag.
[02:23:30.562 --> 02:23:34.043]  But yes, flying the flags upside down is a good way to get people to talk to you.
[02:23:34.423 --> 02:23:36.143]  You explain it's not disrespectful.
[02:23:36.163 --> 02:23:41.124]  No, the Veterans for 9-11 Truth want people to do that, and I think that's the greatest protest.
[02:23:41.564 --> 02:23:42.825]  I was calling for that 12 years ago.
[02:23:44.765 --> 02:23:46.726]  That's what I'm trying to make.
[02:23:46.846 --> 02:23:51.128]  It's respectful to fly a flag when the country's in distress upside down.
[02:23:51.788 --> 02:23:58.472]  It's a good way to start conversations, and not just over 9-11 being an inside job, but over this American Union.
[02:23:58.512 --> 02:24:01.253]  We should all be flying our flags upside down.
[02:24:01.273 --> 02:24:03.534]  You're going to have a flag much longer.
[02:24:05.015 --> 02:24:05.935]  Connie, comments on that?
[02:24:06.135 --> 02:24:07.116]  Yes, I agree with you.
[02:24:08.264 --> 02:24:17.273]  Even on the point that you were making, the reality is that our elected representatives are truly in no control.
[02:24:18.114 --> 02:24:21.617]  They don't even acknowledge if they even know what's really going on.
[02:24:21.657 --> 02:24:22.498]  The information is...
[02:24:23.972 --> 02:24:30.378]  Everything is being done in secret by the permanent government, which operates totally outside the elected... Yeah, that's it.
[02:24:30.398 --> 02:24:30.758]  That's it.
[02:24:30.779 --> 02:24:36.684]  They've been building parallel regional governments at the county, city, federal, state, international level for 70 years.
[02:24:36.804 --> 02:24:40.007]  Now they're transferring final total control to those.
[02:24:40.047 --> 02:24:40.948]  You understand, folks?
[02:24:41.188 --> 02:24:42.189]  We're being hijacked.
[02:24:42.750 --> 02:24:43.430]  It goes to everything.
[02:24:43.470 --> 02:24:45.372]  It goes to the core of all the significant parts.
[02:24:46.188 --> 02:24:47.389]  Of the system, you know.
[02:24:47.449 --> 02:24:53.732]  The courts, food, transportation, schooling, law enforcement, military.
[02:24:53.752 --> 02:24:55.293]  It's all going into these.
[02:24:55.834 --> 02:24:56.954]  Go ahead.
[02:24:56.974 --> 02:24:57.715]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:57.775 --> 02:25:14.564]  And the astonishing thing, the frustrating aspect, is that we've just been through two elections in Canada in the last two years, and none of the mainstream parties in Canada, which there are four who have elected people in Parliament, not one of them profiled any of this.
[02:25:16.653 --> 02:25:24.301]  So Canadian constituents need to go to the meetings, go to the government meetings, get in their face, put pamphlets out, warn the Canadian people.
[02:25:24.341 --> 02:25:25.402]  Same thing in the U.S.
[02:25:25.422 --> 02:25:26.003]  and Mexico.
[02:25:26.323 --> 02:25:27.565]  Tim, anything else from Alberta?
[02:25:28.342 --> 02:25:29.223]  Yeah, just one final thing.
[02:25:29.263 --> 02:25:32.905]  Have you filed a complaint with the Canadian government about your treatment coming across the border?
[02:25:32.925 --> 02:25:38.569]  Because I've emailed all 308 members of Parliament complaining about the way you were treated, and Don's treatment as well.
[02:25:38.969 --> 02:25:39.789]  Have you filed a complaint?
[02:25:39.809 --> 02:25:44.772]  Listen, I've been so busy getting the news out when I got back, hit the ground running, I haven't really worried about myself.
[02:25:45.133 --> 02:25:47.114]  Though I should complain so it doesn't happen to others.
[02:25:47.574 --> 02:25:53.358]  Exactly, because otherwise they'll just brush it off and say, well, Alex hasn't even complained, so what are you so worked up over?
[02:25:54.082 --> 02:25:56.183]  Well, no, I've complained on air into the newspapers.
[02:25:56.203 --> 02:25:56.783]  That's right.
[02:25:56.843 --> 02:26:02.166]  I think that's probably... But a formal complaint into the bureaucracy that they can't say, oh, he doesn't say anything about it.
[02:26:02.346 --> 02:26:05.307]  Well, again, I think Canadians are treated pretty well on average by their government.
[02:26:05.387 --> 02:26:11.570]  I think, just like Americans are naive, I've now been told by a lot of Americans, I got particularly, especially bad treatment.
[02:26:11.610 --> 02:26:12.511]  I mean, I was singled out.
[02:26:12.991 --> 02:26:19.054]  But, man, I'm told that for all over the world, Canadian customs is just vicious.
[02:26:19.674 --> 02:26:25.757]  I mean, I'm told that they're vicious to even American families visiting on tourism, and I don't think Canadians are aware of this.
[02:26:25.777 --> 02:26:28.779]  I mean, have you guys ever heard of that?
[02:26:29.579 --> 02:26:32.680]  Well, I mean, both of you, both to Connie.
[02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:34.001]  No, no, the tables are reversed.
[02:26:34.021 --> 02:26:39.604]  We hear about the difficult, how badly people can be treated by the U.S.
[02:26:39.644 --> 02:26:40.244]  border officials.
[02:26:40.544 --> 02:26:42.865]  I think the reality is, it's not a U.S.
[02:26:42.925 --> 02:26:44.086]  or a Canadian thing.
[02:26:44.642 --> 02:26:49.404]  It's, as such, it's a mentality of a police mentality.
[02:26:49.444 --> 02:26:50.505]  You're right.
[02:26:50.625 --> 02:26:52.226]  Police state mentality, that's it.
[02:26:52.766 --> 02:26:54.146]  And that's the issue.
[02:26:54.647 --> 02:27:00.309]  You see, people would criticize us, the Canadian Action Party, as being narrow, nationalistic, and being anti-American.
[02:27:00.329 --> 02:27:01.890]  We said, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
[02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:06.452]  Oh, no, that's pro-America for you to want to keep your sovereignty.
[02:27:06.472 --> 02:27:10.414]  But, you see, we're talking about the fundamental, we're going to fundamental truths that are applicable...
[02:27:10.854 --> 02:27:14.836]  We're all human beings, you know, internationally, and particularly for us in North America.
[02:27:14.876 --> 02:27:17.617]  We're talking about sovereignty and independence.
[02:27:17.637 --> 02:27:19.097]  Hey, I totally agree with you.
[02:27:19.137 --> 02:27:19.577]  Stay there.
[02:27:20.058 --> 02:27:20.718]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:20.738 --> 02:27:24.920]  We've got links to this organization's websites up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:34.603]  More calls for our guests straight ahead.
[02:27:35.664 --> 02:27:36.564]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.044 --> 02:27:38.565]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.577 --> 02:27:42.261]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.327 --> 02:27:48.189]  So, Janice, where are you and Jim going on vacation this summer?
[02:27:48.209 --> 02:27:52.272]  Definitely somewhere with a beach, though who knows if our feet will even touch the sand.
[02:27:52.512 --> 02:27:56.214]  That reminds me, Janice, have you figured out how to talk to Jim about his problem?
[02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:59.236]  No, I want to, but men can be so sensitive.
[02:27:59.417 --> 02:28:00.818]  Well, it's only going to get worse.
[02:28:01.078 --> 02:28:03.139]  Remember, I was going through the same thing with Dan.
[02:28:03.339 --> 02:28:05.080]  Then I found mycoside NS.
[02:28:05.281 --> 02:28:06.441]  What's mycoside NS?
[02:28:06.782 --> 02:28:10.124]  Mycoside NS kills the germs that can cause fungal infections.
[02:28:10.324 --> 02:28:10.384]  It
[02:28:10.384 --> 02:28:11.544]  It worked great for Dan.
[02:28:11.684 --> 02:28:13.745]  He had the worst looking, thick yellow toenails.
[02:28:13.965 --> 02:28:15.685]  Now his nails look clear and healthy.
[02:28:15.805 --> 02:28:16.786]  Do I need a prescription?
[02:28:17.066 --> 02:28:22.747]  No, you can get Microcyde NS anti-fungal treatment in the foot care aisle at any drug store or major retailer.
[02:28:22.887 --> 02:28:23.968]  And it really worked?
[02:28:24.148 --> 02:28:25.608]  Yep, it worked on me too.
[02:28:25.788 --> 02:28:27.849]  I had some white discolorations on my toe.
[02:28:27.969 --> 02:28:30.009]  I just applied Microcyde NS daily.
[02:28:30.129 --> 02:28:31.890]  I didn't even have to remove my nail polish.
[02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:32.871]  Sounds easy.
[02:28:33.052 --> 02:28:34.854]  I can start planning our beach getaway.
[02:28:35.075 --> 02:28:39.321]  Yeah, Mycoside definitely gave us the confidence to bare our feet again.
[02:28:39.562 --> 02:28:42.526]  Pick up Mycoside NS at drugstores and major retailers.
[02:28:42.627 --> 02:28:44.490]  Look for a free bonus gift in each box.
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:53.444]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.705 --> 02:28:58.047]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.347 --> 02:29:07.252]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.472 --> 02:29:11.094]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.374 --> 02:29:16.423]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons for one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.704 --> 02:29:23.456]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:29:23.936 --> 02:29:24.477]  What about you?
[02:29:25.123 --> 02:29:25.843]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:25.863 --> 02:29:27.144]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.703 --> 02:29:48.045]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:48.285 --> 02:29:50.327]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:50.467 --> 02:29:57.572]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:29:57.792 --> 02:30:06.379]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:30:06.679 --> 02:30:11.365]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:30:11.525 --> 02:30:15.570]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:18.193]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[02:30:18.373 --> 02:30:22.718]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:30:26.122 --> 02:30:26.622]  We're good to go.
[02:30:53.226 --> 02:30:58.288]  If you're calling from Canada, go to the head of the line, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:30:58.328 --> 02:31:00.129]  But this affects us all.
[02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:05.831]  I'm going to give my own little advice to Connie Fogle and everybody who's fighting the American Union.
[02:31:06.571 --> 02:31:10.033]  You explain to people that they're going to use trans-NEPTA highways.
[02:31:10.774 --> 02:31:14.956]  This is in the Texas newspapers with the equivalent of $3.85 per gallon.
[02:31:15.116 --> 02:31:24.239]  The average car, 24 miles to the gallon, and even Tech Scott implementing the international slash federal plan says it will be $3.85 equivalent for 24 miles traveled.
[02:31:24.259 --> 02:31:26.180]  So $3.85 equivalent per gallon average.
[02:31:32.604 --> 02:31:44.186]  And they're going to use that to expand the highways, international zones, giving the Mexican and Canadian government control of major port facilities, including inland train and railway hubs.
[02:31:44.906 --> 02:31:46.326]  The same thing happens to Canada.
[02:31:46.346 --> 02:31:55.508]  This is just a free-for-all with private corporations going in and paying off the regional governors to just hand them entire blocks of infrastructure.
[02:31:55.668 --> 02:31:56.908]  It's gunboat diplomacy.
[02:31:57.849 --> 02:32:00.249]  That term comes from Teddy Roosevelt and the Forbes.
[02:32:01.241 --> 02:32:01.902]  We're good to go.
[02:32:01.922 --> 02:32:02.102]  I think?
[02:32:16.778 --> 02:32:18.039]  And they got more sophisticated.
[02:32:18.059 --> 02:32:21.020]  The IMF and World Bank documents were declassified, were released.
[02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:30.085]  Joseph Sticklitz, chief economist, went public in 2002, and they talked about how they go in, they pay off politicians, the politicians then sign over the infrastructure to them.
[02:32:30.425 --> 02:32:31.166]  It's all criminal.
[02:32:31.206 --> 02:32:34.427]  It's all Enron times ten, times a hundred.
[02:32:34.467 --> 02:32:36.208]  I mean, it is so huge.
[02:32:36.788 --> 02:32:43.592]  So you explain to people that unelected, unaccountable regional boards then report to larger unaccountable parties,
[02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:56.131]  American Union government, and then they just do whatever they want, and then everything is basically turned into our original governing councils that we elect become vestigial.
[02:32:56.931 --> 02:33:00.174]  They become just a side item.
[02:33:01.475 --> 02:33:06.659]  So they become basically rubber stamps or titular.
[02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:08.280]  They don't count.
[02:33:08.841 --> 02:33:10.022]  They're there in name only.
[02:33:10.652 --> 02:33:12.413]  So, it's extremely serious.
[02:33:13.193 --> 02:33:19.735]  Connie, what is your... I mean, you've written a great article here, The Bell Tolls for Canada, and that speaks to your national anthem.
[02:33:20.975 --> 02:33:27.077]  But still, O Canada, my Canada, there are many who will not go silent into this night.
[02:33:28.217 --> 02:33:35.000]  And, of course, that's Connie Fogle, the leader of the CAP, kind of doing a play on words from a national anthem.
[02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:39.401]  And you've written, Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, O Canada, it tolls for thee.
[02:33:40.251 --> 02:33:47.695]  And you've got this article breaking down some of the things that are happening, but what's your main approach to try to warn Canadians about what's happening?
[02:33:48.536 --> 02:33:52.017]  Well, trying to get information out to them.
[02:33:53.818 --> 02:34:01.242]  We have a website, of course, and connecting with media such as yourself or other media... Give that site out.
[02:34:01.262 --> 02:34:06.605]  www.canadianactionparty.ca www.canadianactionparty.ca www.canadianactionparty.ca
[02:34:10.034 --> 02:34:30.063]  You know, just trying to encourage people to understand that this is a political party, a legitimate legal entity of opposition in Canada, that we're inviting people to join and to become part of in order to save ourselves.
[02:34:30.825 --> 02:34:31.305]  We're good to go.
[02:34:57.958 --> 02:34:59.819]  And I've seen in Mexican, Canadian, and U.S.
[02:34:59.839 --> 02:35:05.062]  papers, you'll see the courts rule in the exact same way because they're now already controlled by these international crime syndicates.
[02:35:05.082 --> 02:35:07.324]  They will come in, so continent-wide...
[02:35:20.482 --> 02:35:24.284]  In North America, they're announcing, oh, you don't own your private property.
[02:35:24.304 --> 02:35:27.106]  If a private interest wants it, you've got to give it to them.
[02:35:27.366 --> 02:35:29.227]  They're not even giving just compensation.
[02:35:29.267 --> 02:35:32.049]  Supreme Court rulings, Canadian Supreme Court rulings.
[02:35:32.369 --> 02:35:42.275]  So we see this unification as the puppet governments now rubber stamp everything that the executive branches order them to do.
[02:35:42.595 --> 02:35:42.975]  That's right.
[02:35:43.616 --> 02:35:45.417]  And, I mean, it's important.
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:51.601]  You know, what are people, what are we to do, the ordinary citizen, how are we to combat this?
[02:35:51.661 --> 02:35:57.503]  How are we to take, to wrest back control in the interest of people is the big question.
[02:35:57.883 --> 02:36:15.147]  And so the point of the existence of the Canadian Action Party and the reason for my work in it and my trust is to be able, first of all, to express my unhappiness and dissatisfaction and absolute opposition to what's going on, to have a mechanism to be the voice
[02:36:15.737 --> 02:36:17.938]  The alternatives are nothing but staggeringly frightening.
[02:36:41.491 --> 02:36:41.811]  It is.
[02:36:41.851 --> 02:36:43.352]  We've got to ring the alarm.
[02:36:43.392 --> 02:36:44.273]  It's our job.
[02:36:44.333 --> 02:36:46.254]  I mean, this is actually happening.
[02:36:46.314 --> 02:36:47.495]  Let's take a call.
[02:36:47.995 --> 02:36:49.136]  William in Georgia.
[02:36:49.196 --> 02:36:49.756]  Welcome, sir.
[02:36:49.816 --> 02:36:50.957]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:36:50.997 --> 02:36:52.658]  Hey, yeah, it's great talking to you, Alex.
[02:36:52.678 --> 02:36:54.939]  I just want to bring up a few issues.
[02:36:55.159 --> 02:37:06.566]  I was listening to NPR earlier talking about Iran invading Lebanon, and now they're talking about how those Israeli prisoners they suspect are in Iran.
[02:37:06.966 --> 02:37:08.427]  This could be the spark, my friend.
[02:37:08.447 --> 02:37:10.608]  I just want to see what you think about that.
[02:37:11.331 --> 02:37:13.913]  Well, I mean, restate that a little bit more for me.
[02:37:14.714 --> 02:37:19.738]  Yeah, you know those Israeli prisoners that they're doing all these bombings to justify for?
[02:37:19.778 --> 02:37:20.518]  Yes, yes.
[02:37:20.979 --> 02:37:26.223]  Yeah, I just heard them talking, saying that they believe that they're being smuggled into Iran.
[02:37:26.563 --> 02:37:28.025]  And this could be the spark.
[02:37:28.045 --> 02:37:30.887]  You know, they already openly said they want to nuke Iran.
[02:37:31.624 --> 02:37:32.705]  This is so obvious.
[02:37:32.745 --> 02:37:35.906]  They've been trying to claim that Syria's behind it.
[02:37:35.966 --> 02:37:41.709]  Syria's been trying to grovel, lick boots, begging, pleading, arresting whoever Israel or the U.S.
[02:37:41.749 --> 02:37:48.233]  government tells them to, literally on their knees saying, please, please, please, they're not involved in any terrorism.
[02:37:48.553 --> 02:37:53.856]  They were years ago, and of course terrorism is any military strike back at Israel.
[02:37:54.356 --> 02:37:55.417]  I mean, you've got to love it.
[02:37:55.457 --> 02:37:56.978]  When we, the U.S.
[02:37:57.038 --> 02:38:04.744]  or Israel, attack somebody, or England does, it's loving and sweet and, oh, a 2,000-pound bomb because we love you because we're good.
[02:38:05.785 --> 02:38:08.287]  And even if we attack first, it's called defensive.
[02:38:09.108 --> 02:38:12.250]  But then if anybody else fights back, it's called terrorism.
[02:38:12.911 --> 02:38:21.417]  And you're telling me now, sir, that they're announcing on the news that Israel is saying they think they smuggled these captured troops into Iran.
[02:38:21.437 --> 02:38:22.698]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[02:38:22.919 --> 02:38:23.279]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:24.801]  This could be the spark.
[02:38:24.921 --> 02:38:25.821]  Who reported that?
[02:38:26.202 --> 02:38:26.862]  Who reported that?
[02:38:27.823 --> 02:38:28.323]  NPR.
[02:38:29.023 --> 02:38:42.312]  Okay, we've got a lot of continual coverage on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com on all of this, and we'll continue throughout the weekend, throughout Friday and the weekend, to be covering this, but we'll get that posted as soon as we can find it.
[02:38:42.592 --> 02:38:44.353]  Who exactly was saying this on NPR?
[02:38:44.433 --> 02:38:45.374]  I wouldn't be able to tell you.
[02:38:46.234 --> 02:38:48.696]  You were just driving along and some sniveling creature was saying it?
[02:38:48.776 --> 02:38:49.276]  Exactly.
[02:38:50.397 --> 02:38:52.098]  Okay, thank you for the call.
[02:38:54.497 --> 02:38:56.418]  I tell you, this is really starting to get serious.
[02:38:56.678 --> 02:38:57.659]  It is very serious.
[02:38:57.719 --> 02:38:59.920]  I mean, we're talking potentially for the end of the world.
[02:39:02.302 --> 02:39:04.083]  It's serious stuff.
[02:39:04.963 --> 02:39:05.544]  Well, you're right.
[02:39:05.584 --> 02:39:09.426]  In fact, even New York Daily News is saying the start of World War III has begun.
[02:39:09.466 --> 02:39:13.509]  That was last Thursday was the headline, seven days ago.
[02:39:13.549 --> 02:39:14.009]  You saw that?
[02:39:14.668 --> 02:39:16.248]  Well, you're informed.
[02:39:16.729 --> 02:39:19.269]  Most people wouldn't read New York Daily News even if they lived in New York.
[02:39:19.989 --> 02:39:31.472]  But all of this is happening, and then at the very same time, for no reason they want to attack all these countries to escalate a global crisis, and meanwhile they're getting rid of our own countries.
[02:39:32.113 --> 02:39:35.233]  They claim they're going to have these wars for the U.S.
[02:39:35.293 --> 02:39:39.034]  and for Canada and for England and for the sovereignty of these countries.
[02:39:39.335 --> 02:39:40.875]  Meanwhile, they're killing our countries.
[02:39:42.512 --> 02:39:47.994]  Well, you know, we are in the age of doublespeak, you know, the Orwellian doublespeak.
[02:39:48.034 --> 02:40:00.919]  If anybody has never read or a long time ago read Orwell's 1984, I recommend everybody go back and read it because what he predicted, which was a futuristic novel, but in fact, when you read it, it's what's happening right now.
[02:40:00.959 --> 02:40:03.540]  It's unfolding right now, and people get a handle on it.
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:08.862]  The major ploy, of course, is the use of language to say one thing but mean something totally other to it.
[02:40:09.127 --> 02:40:13.511]  To use language that pretends you're doing something for the benefit and the good of people when in fact it's hurting them.
[02:40:14.291 --> 02:40:20.437]  It's important to understand how all of this operates and you put your finger on that just in what you've described.
[02:40:21.077 --> 02:40:37.571]  So we have to inform people for them to be thinking and understanding how to go to the root of what is really happening and what is really being meant so that people can stand up for themselves and defend themselves.
[02:40:39.355 --> 02:40:40.995]  Well, you're absolutely right about that.
[02:40:41.895 --> 02:40:43.036]  Let's take another call.
[02:40:43.616 --> 02:40:45.156]  Let's talk to Mick in New York.
[02:40:45.256 --> 02:40:46.156]  Mick, thanks for holding.
[02:40:47.456 --> 02:40:49.377]  Mike, I love to butcher names.
[02:40:49.437 --> 02:40:49.917]  Go ahead.
[02:40:51.337 --> 02:40:53.397]  I just want to talk about the Zawahiri videos.
[02:40:53.637 --> 02:40:54.978]  I've been watching those a lot lately.
[02:40:56.338 --> 02:41:01.239]  I don't know if he's writing this stuff himself, but whoever's writing it is clearly a PR master.
[02:41:02.659 --> 02:41:05.460]  It's clear the intention is to infuriate the average bush lover.
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:07.820]  My specific question is...
[02:41:08.530 --> 02:41:15.398]  There's one tape where he claims that Bin Laden made Bush an offer that could end the Iraq conflict.
[02:41:16.119 --> 02:41:18.162]  And he said Bush's answer was, we don't
[02:41:18.723 --> 02:41:19.724]  Negotiate with terrorists.
[02:41:20.064 --> 02:41:22.005]  Now, those guys are all CIA operatives.
[02:41:22.045 --> 02:41:23.486]  That's even been in mainstream news.
[02:41:23.906 --> 02:41:25.087]  It's all completely staged.
[02:41:25.127 --> 02:41:26.028]  It's all PR.
[02:41:26.588 --> 02:41:30.351]  From chopping people's heads off, it's come out.
[02:41:30.391 --> 02:41:31.331]  That's all staged.
[02:41:31.691 --> 02:41:33.212]  The fake bin Laden videos.
[02:41:33.633 --> 02:41:35.574]  Folks, we have White House documents.
[02:41:35.594 --> 02:41:39.196]  They bought $1.6 billion in fake news.
[02:41:39.797 --> 02:41:41.778]  They tell us all the Iraq newspapers are independent.
[02:41:41.798 --> 02:41:44.840]  It turns out they're all completely run and staged and written out of the U.S.,
[02:41:45.336 --> 02:41:45.676]  We're good to go.
[02:41:45.696 --> 02:41:45.836]  I think?
[02:42:09.105 --> 02:42:10.566]  I met a neighbor that lied to me once.
[02:42:10.927 --> 02:42:13.168]  I said, hey, will you house shit for me?
[02:42:13.208 --> 02:42:17.132]  I'll pay you to do it, or I'll swap out next month when you're on vacation.
[02:42:17.392 --> 02:42:18.653]  Will you feed my dogs twice a day?
[02:42:18.673 --> 02:42:19.974]  Will you feed my fish?
[02:42:20.614 --> 02:42:25.398]  And then you come home, and your fish are dead, and your dog's almost dead.
[02:42:25.418 --> 02:42:28.001]  And you say, did you feed them?
[02:42:28.021 --> 02:42:28.681]  Did you water them?
[02:42:28.741 --> 02:42:29.422]  Oh, yeah, I did.
[02:42:29.442 --> 02:42:32.184]  And there's dog poop all over the house, and your fish are dead.
[02:42:32.644 --> 02:42:34.606]  And then you ask them to do it again.
[02:42:35.226 --> 02:42:35.807]  You believe them.
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:41.787]  But you set something on top of the fish food, you know, a little speck or something to see if they actually feed them.
[02:42:42.027 --> 02:42:43.829]  You come back, the fish are dead again.
[02:42:45.011 --> 02:42:48.895]  This time the dog looks sick, but it looks like they might have been given one bowl of water.
[02:42:48.915 --> 02:42:52.380]  Or you ask them to water your plants for the second time, they're all dead.
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:54.502]  You're not going to have them house-sit again.
[02:42:54.522 --> 02:42:55.283]  Or it's worse.
[02:42:56.064 --> 02:42:57.404]  You come home and you've been robbed.
[02:42:57.424 --> 02:42:59.045]  Your television and your computers are gone.
[02:42:59.585 --> 02:43:02.326]  And your neighbor says, oh gosh, somebody must have broke in while you were gone.
[02:43:02.346 --> 02:43:04.027]  But the police say no breaking and entering.
[02:43:04.407 --> 02:43:07.908]  And then a year later you're at their house for a barbecue and there's your television set.
[02:43:08.188 --> 02:43:12.489]  And you see the scratch on the front of it where your five-year-old threw something at it a year before.
[02:43:12.509 --> 02:43:13.650]  And you know it's your TV.
[02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:14.730]  You go, that's my TV.
[02:43:14.770 --> 02:43:15.810]  And they go, no it's not.
[02:43:16.471 --> 02:43:17.771]  Imagine 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 times they lie to you.
[02:43:21.372 --> 02:43:26.513]  Okay, I mean, let's say you know that they're cheating with your wife.
[02:43:26.813 --> 02:43:37.936]  You finally catch him in bed after a year of suspecting it, and then he's actually in bed with your wife, they are actually in the act, and then they look at you while they're having sex, and they say we weren't having sex.
[02:43:38.096 --> 02:43:38.856]  That's not happening.
[02:43:39.817 --> 02:43:40.477]  Well, exactly.
[02:43:40.537 --> 02:43:43.017]  This is just cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[02:43:43.838 --> 02:43:44.558]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:44.578 --> 02:43:47.178]  So, I don't know.
[02:43:47.198 --> 02:43:48.979]  It just infuriates me.
[02:43:49.019 --> 02:43:49.339]  I mean, it's
[02:43:50.629 --> 02:43:54.090]  Do you think PR firms are really just writing this stuff for them to read out?
[02:43:56.431 --> 02:43:56.831]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:56.911 --> 02:44:00.132]  There are so many different ways they propagandize, but that's one of the main ones.
[02:44:01.052 --> 02:44:01.272]  Wow.
[02:44:01.912 --> 02:44:03.033]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:44:03.473 --> 02:44:06.013]  I was just told... I'm on remote every day, folks.
[02:44:06.053 --> 02:44:07.194]  I'm down in Austin, Texas.
[02:44:07.214 --> 02:44:08.094]  They're in Minnesota.
[02:44:08.394 --> 02:44:16.596]  They offer to have the instant message to give me calls, but I like to scribble them down, and then when they pop in my ear and tell me I have another caller from Canada who goes in front of people, I miss it.
[02:44:16.916 --> 02:44:18.617]  So who was that caller from Canada again?
[02:44:19.773 --> 02:44:20.553]  Chuck in Canada.
[02:44:20.573 --> 02:44:21.114]  You're on the air.
[02:44:21.154 --> 02:44:21.594]  Go ahead.
[02:44:22.134 --> 02:44:31.378]  I just want to mention that I think the reason why Canadians are so dumbed down on what's going on is because the media is absolutely refusing to print any information on this.
[02:44:31.458 --> 02:44:35.400]  I'm just wondering what she has done in her initiative.
[02:44:36.075 --> 02:44:39.477]  To approach the media and try and make them print something about it.
[02:44:39.497 --> 02:44:40.098]  Let me stop you.
[02:44:40.118 --> 02:44:49.264]  To be fair, almost, not almost, all the Ottawa papers and several national papers and CBC and CTV all ran reports while I was there.
[02:44:49.284 --> 02:44:50.485]  And that's just the stuff I saw.
[02:44:50.965 --> 02:44:56.810]  It was everywhere talking, and they were quoting me saying, they're creating an American Union, they're getting rid of Canada's sovereignty.
[02:44:57.070 --> 02:44:58.951]  But they never backed me up.
[02:44:59.011 --> 02:45:03.054]  Everything I was saying was true, but it was like Mr. Conspiracy says this.
[02:45:03.394 --> 02:45:11.579]  Yeah, and I was talking to a senior producer at CBC named Mark Harrison, and he made a comment that this is not taking place.
[02:45:11.659 --> 02:45:15.702]  And I actually have an audio on Wavefile that says precisely that.
[02:45:15.722 --> 02:45:20.665]  So according to CBC, this push for the North American Union and the NAFTA highway...
[02:45:21.701 --> 02:45:22.702]  Does not exist.
[02:45:22.902 --> 02:45:31.264]  So according to the CBC, there are not walleye in your lakes, and you do not have moose, and there are not lots of pine trees.
[02:45:31.444 --> 02:45:32.605]  That's right.
[02:45:32.625 --> 02:45:34.605]  The caller is correct about what's happening in Canada.
[02:45:34.625 --> 02:45:37.686]  What you've described, you think it's great that there's been this exposure, but you know what?
[02:45:38.166 --> 02:45:39.207]  It's because of your being.
[02:45:39.587 --> 02:45:46.289]  Whatever was written there was because you happened to what happened to you at the border, and that made some news and some profile.
[02:45:46.729 --> 02:45:49.450]  You caused a response and a reaction, so...
[02:45:49.941 --> 02:45:50.181]  Exactly.
[02:46:11.604 --> 02:46:15.805]  Well, see, that's the good news.
[02:46:15.925 --> 02:46:16.846]  That's the good news.
[02:46:17.226 --> 02:46:17.906]  That's great news.
[02:46:18.046 --> 02:46:20.647]  Connie, the mainstream media is losing its credibility.
[02:46:20.707 --> 02:46:21.487]  Anything else, Chuck?
[02:46:21.907 --> 02:46:22.607]  No, that's it.
[02:46:22.687 --> 02:46:24.148]  I just also want to say thanks, Alex.
[02:46:24.188 --> 02:46:25.968]  Thanks, Carol, for bringing this information out.
[02:46:26.008 --> 02:46:29.269]  Because if it wasn't for you, I know a lot of people would be completely ignorant.
[02:46:29.369 --> 02:46:32.730]  And it's that Lou Dobbs video that I've played for people that has really opened their eyes.
[02:46:33.130 --> 02:46:34.491]  And that's what this all comes down to.
[02:46:34.551 --> 02:46:40.257]  In fact, speak of the devil, can you find that Lou Dobbs piece from last week?
[02:46:40.277 --> 02:46:41.818]  I just want to play the first minute or two of that.
[02:46:42.799 --> 02:46:47.923]  And once people hear that, something instinctively switches on that light.
[02:46:48.444 --> 02:46:54.529]  Well, let's go ahead and roll just a minute of that right now before we go to break, and we'll come back and take more calls.
[02:46:54.569 --> 02:46:55.210]  Scott, you find it?
[02:46:56.972 --> 02:46:59.633]  Here is Lou Dobbs last week.
[02:46:59.673 --> 02:47:00.154]  Here it is.
[02:47:00.454 --> 02:47:09.798]  The Bush administration's open borders policy and its decision to ignore the enforcement of this country's immigration laws is part of a broader agenda.
[02:47:10.598 --> 02:47:14.660]  President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States as we know it.
[02:47:15.421 --> 02:47:18.142]  And he took the step without approval from either the U.S.
[02:47:18.182 --> 02:47:20.843]  Congress or the people of the United States.
[02:47:21.743 --> 02:47:22.704]  Bill Tucker reports.
[02:47:24.309 --> 02:47:32.834]  The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America sounds benign, partly like a policy that critics call NAFTA on steroids.
[02:47:33.254 --> 02:47:35.215]  It's a deal that few have even heard of.
[02:47:35.496 --> 02:47:42.940]  It's being done again by very few people at the very top on behalf of the investment class, but the working class of people.
[02:47:43.795 --> 02:47:49.918]  The political officials across our country from communities, from cities and so forth, they don't know anything about this.
[02:47:50.398 --> 02:47:56.241]  Yet it was agreed to by Mexico's President Fox, Canada's Prime Minister Martin and President Bush in 2005.
[02:47:56.581 --> 02:48:04.464]  The administration officials countered their critics by saying everything about SPP is on the White House website.
[02:48:04.885 --> 02:48:12.328]  And they say the partnership is not a treaty but more of an outline of priorities between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
[02:48:12.948 --> 02:48:18.011]  Still, some wonder why there haven't been public discussions about the goals being pursued.
[02:48:18.311 --> 02:48:27.237]  This SPP includes, for instance, a committee that is sitting down to harmonize our meat inspection and food safety.
[02:48:27.337 --> 02:48:29.098]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:48:29.118 --> 02:48:33.581]  We'll be right back with a few final calls with our guest, and we'll wrap up this.
[02:48:33.961 --> 02:48:35.582]  This has been a good Thursday edition.
[02:48:36.405 --> 02:48:37.768]  Alright, stay with us, stay the course.
[02:48:37.908 --> 02:48:42.957]  PrisonPlanet.com Infowars.com JonesReport.com Infowars.net
[02:48:45.555 --> 02:48:47.035]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.215 --> 02:48:50.316]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.436 --> 02:48:54.357]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.397 --> 02:48:58.618]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:58.958 --> 02:49:02.739]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.819 --> 02:49:04.700]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:08.201]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.221 --> 02:49:09.321]  The medical bills...
[02:49:10.922 --> 02:49:12.943]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.103 --> 02:49:16.144]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.324 --> 02:49:19.186]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[02:49:19.666 --> 02:49:25.789]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.309 --> 02:49:27.029]  We're good to go.
[02:49:27.049 --> 02:49:27.530]  We're good to go.
[02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:48.624]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:48.985 --> 02:49:57.797]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.117 --> 02:50:02.804]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.264 --> 02:50:09.989]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:22.158]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.638 --> 02:50:27.102]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.263 --> 02:50:31.586]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:31.606 --> 02:50:34.329]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:34.349 --> 02:50:35.390]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.212 --> 02:50:52.141]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.381 --> 02:50:54.644]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:54.825 --> 02:51:01.194]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.514 --> 02:51:02.155]  We're good to go.
[02:51:31.033 --> 02:51:34.114]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.294 --> 02:51:40.295]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:47.976 --> 02:51:53.997]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.617 --> 02:51:57.578]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:04.545 --> 02:52:06.687]  Final segment with Connie Vogel.
[02:52:06.988 --> 02:52:10.171]  She is the leader of the Canadian Action Party.
[02:52:10.191 --> 02:52:12.373]  We have details at Infowars.com for you.
[02:52:12.393 --> 02:52:14.755]  A few final phone calls here.
[02:52:14.856 --> 02:52:16.357]  Cliff in Idaho, thanks for holding.
[02:52:16.637 --> 02:52:17.318]  You're on the air.
[02:52:17.618 --> 02:52:19.721]  Thank God for you and Connie.
[02:52:20.001 --> 02:52:23.444]  I've got some important information to give to you, if I can real quick.
[02:52:24.265 --> 02:52:25.907]  You know Tom Martino, the troubleshooter?
[02:52:26.465 --> 02:52:28.646]  I mean, he's got an audience all over the United States.
[02:52:28.666 --> 02:52:29.686]  Yes, I've heard the show.
[02:52:29.946 --> 02:52:34.107]  Okay, I sent him some material, and he put it out yesterday, and he is madder than hell.
[02:52:34.487 --> 02:52:40.689]  And I sent him some more yesterday, you know, concerning the 82 more international toll roads they're putting in.
[02:52:41.049 --> 02:52:41.349]  Really?
[02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:43.050]  So Tom Martino's gotten on board?
[02:52:43.310 --> 02:52:43.930]  Oh, you betcha he has.
[02:52:43.950 --> 02:52:45.090]  Well, see, that's how this happens.
[02:52:45.150 --> 02:52:46.691]  Most people in the media aren't evil.
[02:52:46.711 --> 02:52:47.531]  They're just ignorant.
[02:52:48.171 --> 02:52:48.891]  That's correct.
[02:52:48.951 --> 02:52:51.652]  And also, I put it out on Probing America.
[02:52:52.387 --> 02:52:54.869]  And Mark Richardson's brother is Todd Richardson.
[02:52:54.909 --> 02:53:00.432]  He's an attorney, and he said there wasn't signed in all this stuff, and then I gave him the deal from Lou Dobbs.
[02:53:01.053 --> 02:53:08.397]  And, Connie, you ought to get on the Tom Martino Show or whatever, and you have him on also, Alex.
[02:53:08.818 --> 02:53:09.318]  Okay.
[02:53:09.478 --> 02:53:10.119]  You want his number?
[02:53:10.699 --> 02:53:11.399]  No, that's okay.
[02:53:11.479 --> 02:53:13.040]  I know how to get a hold of him if I need to.
[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:15.202]  Okay, well, get a hold of this Todd Richardson, too.
[02:53:15.262 --> 02:53:18.904]  His website is ToddRichardson at Excite.com.
[02:53:18.984 --> 02:53:20.125]  Okay, thank you so much.
[02:53:20.145 --> 02:53:20.825]  I appreciate it.
[02:53:20.845 --> 02:53:21.626]  You keep it up.
[02:53:22.279 --> 02:53:22.679]  Well, yes, it is.
[02:53:22.700 --> 02:53:22.900]  It does.
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:23.400]  I agree with you.
[02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:23.680]  My concern is...
[02:53:42.788 --> 02:53:43.048]  I agree.
[02:53:43.068 --> 02:53:48.813]  I think they foresee that they're going to lose things politically, so they're getting ready for dictatorship.
[02:53:56.451 --> 02:53:57.071]  You're doing it.
[02:53:57.092 --> 02:53:57.772]  It's so important.
[02:53:57.872 --> 02:54:04.237]  And what I'm trying to do up here and to let people know that we have... Well, you need volunteers.
[02:54:04.257 --> 02:54:05.057]  You need supporters.
[02:54:05.077 --> 02:54:06.658]  And so they need to contact you and get involved.
[02:54:06.698 --> 02:54:07.339]  You're a good group.
[02:54:07.539 --> 02:54:09.601]  Let's talk to Joe in Florida.
[02:54:09.641 --> 02:54:10.441]  Joe, last caller.
[02:54:10.481 --> 02:54:10.861]  Go ahead.
[02:54:11.102 --> 02:54:11.482]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:11.502 --> 02:54:12.202]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:54:12.262 --> 02:54:13.723]  I've got a real cool question for you.
[02:54:14.684 --> 02:54:15.785]  I'm trying to do my part.
[02:54:15.925 --> 02:54:19.668]  I'm trying to assemble a documentary myself, kind of like in a Dylan Avery style.
[02:54:20.108 --> 02:54:21.009]  I don't want my computer.
[02:54:21.569 --> 02:54:25.452]  I heard that JFK speech the other day on your show about secret societies.
[02:54:26.289 --> 02:54:28.933]  I need the date and location he gave that.
[02:54:28.973 --> 02:54:30.696]  Yeah, it's been on Infowars.com.
[02:54:30.716 --> 02:54:32.859]  It's in the archives, so you just have to look around for it.
[02:54:32.939 --> 02:54:33.620]  I looked it up.
[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:35.823]  I couldn't find the date or location on every link.
[02:54:36.384 --> 02:54:40.010]  Yeah, I can't really direct everybody to each link, but it's there, sir.
[02:54:41.227 --> 02:54:42.048]  I'm sorry, I can't help it.
[02:54:42.068 --> 02:54:43.628]  I mean, I don't even have a computer on in front of me.
[02:54:43.648 --> 02:54:47.390]  I usually have a computer off in here because when I do have one on, it becomes a distraction.
[02:54:47.430 --> 02:54:50.172]  I start surfing and then I'm not listening to the guests or the callers.
[02:54:50.592 --> 02:54:53.554]  I tried it for a few months again and then I just turned it off.
[02:54:53.594 --> 02:54:54.254]  I just can't have it.
[02:54:54.274 --> 02:54:57.436]  Because I would try to go answer your question right now and I just can't do it.
[02:54:58.396 --> 02:54:59.577]  But sorry I couldn't help you.
[02:54:59.597 --> 02:55:01.038]  I'm not trying to be persnickety.
[02:55:01.138 --> 02:55:03.039]  I'm just not going to blow hot air at you.
[02:55:03.579 --> 02:55:05.921]  Well, Connie, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:55:05.961 --> 02:55:07.423]  Give us that website one more time.
[02:55:07.943 --> 02:55:14.469]  www.canadianactionparty.ca And what about a phone number for folks that want to call you?
[02:55:15.049 --> 02:55:19.473]  They can call me at 604-872-2128.
[02:55:20.134 --> 02:55:22.756]  One more time.
[02:55:22.776 --> 02:55:23.277]  604-872-2128.
[02:55:23.997 --> 02:55:24.958]  Connie, Godspeed.
[02:55:24.978 --> 02:55:26.379]  We'll be talking to you in the near future.
[02:55:26.559 --> 02:55:26.940]  Excellent.
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:27.781]  God bless you.
[02:55:27.821 --> 02:55:28.641]  Keep up the good work.
[02:55:28.661 --> 02:55:29.322]  Good to hear from you.
[02:55:31.411 --> 02:55:33.972]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:34.032 --> 02:55:35.153]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:35.293 --> 02:55:38.414]  And we'll see you back, of course, on Monday as well, through the weekend.
[02:55:39.794 --> 02:55:41.275]  Things are really heating up in Israel.
[02:55:41.955 --> 02:55:46.217]  A serious situation as they try to have a provocation for the neocons to start World War III.
[02:55:47.118 --> 02:55:49.458]  Pray that God try to stop this.
[02:55:49.498 --> 02:55:51.299]  Pray that the people try to stop this.
[02:55:51.839 --> 02:55:53.000]  Pray that God lead them to do that.
[02:55:54.122 --> 02:55:57.525]  And please get my new film, Terror Storm, so you'll learn who's really behind the terror.
[02:55:57.625 --> 02:56:00.106]  It's out right now, available at Infowars.com.

[02:56:06.491 --> 02:56:08.212]  We live in very serious times.
[02:56:08.232 --> 02:56:20.661]  We live at massive crossroads at so many levels, and it's important that every man, woman, and child, Hispanic, black, white, polka-dotted, and purple, it's important that all of us come together against tyranny, all of us exert ourselves to expose this evil.
[02:56:21.021 --> 02:56:22.442]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:22.482 --> 02:56:23.383]  God bless you all.
