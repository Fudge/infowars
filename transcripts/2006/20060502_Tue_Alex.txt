[00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.444]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:08.165]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:09.986]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:11.448]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:13.089]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.612]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:22.095]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.361]  Well, New Hampshire has done something that's...
[00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.067]  Good news for the entire country, especially if it spreads.
[00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:42.291]  They have passed, out of their legislature, officially, a law blocking the Real ID Act.
[00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:50.816]  The federal legislation passed early last year, almost a year ago, by George Bush and his so-called Conservative Congress.
[00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:55.759]  And now it is going to the Governor's desk, and the Governor is saying he's going to sign it.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:11.424]  And coming up in the next hour, just for about 10-15 minutes, we're going to have some of the folks on who are responsible for getting this done, and hopefully you can duplicate what they're doing in your area, whether it's California, Texas, Illinois, Missouri, Florida, any state in the Union.
[00:01:12.293 --> 00:01:18.175]  And there are several other states following suit to move forward to block the REAL ID Act as well.
[00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:27.619]  And we'll also get into why the REAL ID Act is bad and why you don't want a national ID card and databases and all the control that goes with it.
[00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:43.483]  Also, another state has introduced legislation, in fact quite a few have, but Vermont is moving ahead nicely to impeach Bush, which actually through the Electoral College and the Constitution, that's where impeachment really should start.
[00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:50.514]  And so very similar to what we saw in the eve of the Civil War when there were moves by the states to pull out of the Union.
[00:01:50.534 --> 00:01:53.237]  Well this is a move to impeach the President by the states.
[00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:54.098]  It's now spread to what?
[00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:57.903]  Four separate states and Vermont is very close to defeating that.
[00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:00.386]  So that's coming up with a guest in about 30 minutes.
[00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:17.705]  We will have open phones, of course, today after we've talked to these two guests coming up at the bottom of this hour and the start of the next hour as we look at the Tenth Amendment in play as the people, through their states, stand up to the out-of-control central government.
[00:02:18.986 --> 00:02:20.747]  I don't know how I didn't get into this yesterday.
[00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:24.190]  I mean, I barely mentioned it, so I should spend some time on it today.
[00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.531]  The U.S.
[00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:28.193]  allowed Zarqari to escape
[00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:44.023]  The United States deliberately passed up repeated opportunities to kill the head of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, Jordanian-born terrorist Abu Massab al-Zawahiri, before the March 2003 US-led invasion of that country.
[00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:45.564]  So we'll get into that.
[00:02:45.584 --> 00:02:48.346]  I also want to cover some economic developments.
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.701]  Official federal numbers foreclosures soar 63% over the last year, not a very good economic indicator.
[00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:59.942]  And people say, Alex, be positive!
[00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:03.242]  You're trying to wreck our economy, just be positive!
[00:03:03.262 --> 00:03:09.023]  Well, I'm sorry, I can't be positive about the real economic indicators and indices that we see.
[00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:18.105]  And so I'm going to get into it today and what globalization is doing to this nation, what it's doing to this country.
[00:03:19.392 --> 00:03:26.760]  A lot of different reports and tidbits coming out concerning the May Day rallies by millions of illegal aliens across the country.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.320]  300,000 in Chicago.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.101]  500,000 in Los Angeles.
[00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.123]  A few thousand in Austin.
[00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:31.224]  Tens of thousands in Dallas.
[00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:33.507]  Tens of thousands in Houston.
[00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:42.859]  The media trying to hype it and talk about how it's as American as sliced bread.
[00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.500]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.363]  But finally, the mainstream media is having to report on some of the violence.
[00:03:47.904 --> 00:03:50.026]  Here's one out of Orange County Register.
[00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:52.508]  Rock throwing reported in Santa Ana.
[00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:55.570]  Hitting cops with rocks, bottles, and marbles.
[00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:59.114]  And the police were ordered to stand down and take it.
[00:03:59.914 --> 00:04:03.878]  We've seen this before, so I'll get into this report and some of the others.
[00:04:05.046 --> 00:04:10.007]  Really interesting story out of WNBC News 4.
[00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:15.409]  Bird flu strain not dangerous to people found in New Jersey market.
[00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.171]  That's right, but for a day or so they reported that bird flu had been found in New Jersey.
[00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:27.552]  Well there are at any one time hundreds of different bird flus going around the world.
[00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:32.433]  Birds get the flu just like people and of course it's not the deadly
[00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:37.781]  Strange that they've seen in Europe and Asia, but it didn't matter.
[00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:43.366]  It was good for hype, good for fear, good dress rehearsal for when it does arrive.
[00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:51.694]  So when we get back, we'll go over this first, and we'll get into the economy, we'll get into the illegal aliens, and of course your phone calls and a lot more.
[00:04:52.014 --> 00:04:53.235]  By the way, I'm really proud of it.
[00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:54.496]  We're updating it daily now.
[00:04:55.037 --> 00:04:56.938]  It's jonesreport.com.
[00:04:57.359 --> 00:04:59.641]  Be sure and check out jonesreport.com.
[00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:09.762]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:10.022 --> 00:05:14.765]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.985 --> 00:05:20.628]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:25.409]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:32.772]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:33.592]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:05:33.612 --> 00:05:37.333]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.493 --> 00:05:39.994]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.234 --> 00:05:46.936]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:47.176 --> 00:05:52.442]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.462 --> 00:05:52.882]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:11.255]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:22.738]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw, stagnant pond water, into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:28.780]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.961]  We're good to go!
[00:06:50.244 --> 00:07:04.528]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:07:04.768 --> 00:07:05.648]  Look no further!
[00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:08.489]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:17.412]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:07:17.592 --> 00:07:18.712]  You can order everything you need
[00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:19.032]  I think so.
[00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:35.579]  I don't know.
[00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:07.331]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:19.861]  The social architects that openly manipulate our society using psychological techniques.
[00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:24.905]  They write official textbooks bragging about it, calling us their slaves, literally.
[00:08:26.787 --> 00:08:35.890]  They are using things like the war on terror, the threat of drugs, the threat of bird flu to sell us on giving up our freedoms.
[00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:45.393]  And the more freedom we give up, the more tyranny we witness, the more of America that we see being dismantled.
[00:08:45.433 --> 00:08:46.434]  Take the war on drugs.
[00:08:46.514 --> 00:08:51.956]  The bigger the war on drugs gets, the more people are in prison and the more narcotics flood our streets.
[00:08:52.716 --> 00:08:54.897]  Simultaneously, Big Pharma is pushing
[00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:12.893]  Legal drugs, in some cases forcibly on the population, which their own molecular makeup and their own inserts admit, are in many cases more toxic, more dangerous, more addictive, more destructive than the illegal drugs.
[00:09:14.714 --> 00:09:15.975]  And that's just one example.
[00:09:15.995 --> 00:09:17.657]  We've had a war on illiteracy.
[00:09:17.697 --> 00:09:18.798]  We have higher illiteracy.
[00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:21.540]  We've had a war on poverty.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.681]  We have more poverty.
[00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:24.269]  We've had the war on drugs.
[00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:25.030]  We have more drugs.
[00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.211]  We're having a war on terror.
[00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:27.533]  More terror globally.
[00:09:28.554 --> 00:09:29.374]  It never ends.
[00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:31.477]  There's always got to be a new war.
[00:09:31.497 --> 00:09:37.783]  Well, remember yesterday I read this Associated Press article by Andrew Bridges.
[00:09:37.903 --> 00:09:40.126]  Bird flu hitting TV screens May 9th.
[00:09:40.928 --> 00:09:44.150]  And this is from the AP article, first line here.
[00:09:44.711 --> 00:09:48.453]  Bodies piling up so quickly it takes dump trucks to hold them away.
[00:09:48.973 --> 00:09:52.075]  Barbed wire to keep whole neighborhoods quarantined.
[00:09:52.556 --> 00:09:54.417]  It's Hollywood's version of bird flu.
[00:09:54.857 --> 00:09:58.660]  A blur of fact and fiction that some scientists say could confuse the public.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.121]  Why do I go back and mention that?
[00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:04.203]  Because here it is out of WNBC.
[00:10:05.844 --> 00:10:09.567]  Yesterday afternoon, for a few hours of hysteria,
[00:10:10.365 --> 00:10:16.447]  They announce that bird flu has been found in Trenton, New Jersey!
[00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:20.509]  It's all over America!
[00:10:20.969 --> 00:10:22.189]  We're doomed!
[00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.210]  Oh my gosh!
[00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:27.891]  We may have martial law within days!
[00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:31.733]  And then the government comes back to our aid and says no!
[00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:37.209]  No, it was an N1 virus, but there are many, many variants of that.
[00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:45.673]  It's not the latest mutation of what, six, eight months ago in Central Asia and now into Western Europe.
[00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:51.857]  Oh no, it's the type that just makes the birdies sick.
[00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:58.801]  Now, most human flus develop from pigs, that's swine, oinkers, you know,
[00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.012]  Or it comes from the quackers.
[00:11:02.072 --> 00:11:03.052]  The quack quackers.
[00:11:03.072 --> 00:11:04.353]  Sorry, I'm going to stop being stupid here.
[00:11:05.094 --> 00:11:06.995]  The point is, this is all very irritating.
[00:11:07.976 --> 00:11:12.218]  Bird flu strain, not dangerous to people, found in New Jersey markets.
[00:11:12.238 --> 00:11:15.180]  So they could have gone out and found any bird flu anywhere.
[00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:17.442]  They knew full well that it wasn't deadly.
[00:11:17.702 --> 00:11:24.507]  They knew full well it wasn't even the type that's passed from fowl to fowl, whether it be chicken or geese or ducks or turkeys.
[00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:28.581]  And then rarely pass to humans from the animal.
[00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:29.782]  Not human to human.
[00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:39.967]  And almost everyone who's gotten it, of the hundred and what, twenty-something that have died now in the last year and a half, remember we were told a year ago by Christmas there'd be millions dead worldwide.
[00:11:40.027 --> 00:11:41.348]  Perhaps millions dead in America.
[00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:42.969]  Perhaps two billion, three billion.
[00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:44.330]  Perhaps five billion.
[00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:50.273]  Perhaps everyone would die from it because there's flus and they're in the birds.
[00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:53.415]  And who's hyping it?
[00:11:54.102 --> 00:11:59.749]  Rumsfeld, Gilead Pharmaceutical, who made over $5 billion dollars last time I checked.
[00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:00.710]  It's in the first few months.
[00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:05.936]  Last year of the hysteria, they'd made $5 billion extra off of their Tamiflu.
[00:12:06.317 --> 00:12:09.120]  And the Japanese started reporting that people were taking it there and dying.
[00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:13.065]  And then it didn't even protect you from the bird flu to begin with.
[00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:37.169]  It's just like what, almost four years ago we were told, everyone, 14 million emergency workers, every fireman, every policeman, every nurse, every doctor, every person that works in a hospital, key state and federal employees, you've got to show up in the next month or your insurance will be revoked, you've got to immediately take the smallpox vaccine.
[00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:45.576]  And then top virologists, top epidemiologists, top scientists began to go public and say, I'm not going to take this!
[00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:58.410]  This protects you from a 70's strain of smallpox, and if we're hit with smallpox, it's going to be weaponized, and this is more dangerous per capita.
[00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:12.495]  This will actually cause smallpox to spread, because it's a live virus, and it's going to cause heart attacks and strokes as a side effect, and only a few thousand people took it out of that... I forget the numbers.
[00:13:12.555 --> 00:13:14.115]  I mean, I never counted them all up.
[00:13:14.175 --> 00:13:15.796]  It was every few days somebody was dying.
[00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:18.418]  Reporters were taking it in Iraq and dying.
[00:13:18.758 --> 00:13:20.179]  Cops were taking it and dying.
[00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:21.419]  Doctors were taking it and dying.
[00:13:21.939 --> 00:13:29.202]  And Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson went from saying everyone must take it to a member six months later saying, I'm not taking it, it's not safe!
[00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:37.966]  But not before the government's buddies in industry have been given billions of dollars to cook up what several hundred million doses of it.
[00:13:39.188 --> 00:13:40.429]  So this is multi-level.
[00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:54.439]  It gets you ready for martial law, conditions you that the government's going to save you, and we're all basically children, and then at the same time they also always position it where the media hypes whatever big pharma drug makes people in the Bush administration rich.
[00:13:56.841 --> 00:13:58.942]  Remember the anthrax antibiotic?
[00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:01.044]  Remember that?
[00:14:01.364 --> 00:14:02.685]  And who did it lead back to?
[00:14:02.725 --> 00:14:03.565]  The Bush administration?
[00:14:03.585 --> 00:14:04.126]  Who was on it?
[00:14:04.586 --> 00:14:08.489]  September 10th, three and a half weeks before it popped up in Boca Raton, Florida in American media.
[00:14:10.188 --> 00:14:11.008]  Remember all that?
[00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:15.911]  They made what was like over ten million off that little hysteria.
[00:14:17.472 --> 00:14:20.454]  And no, this isn't the plot to V for Vendetta.
[00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:27.037]  I've already gotten an email yesterday after I talked about how they staged these crises and how they make money off of the pharmacologicals.
[00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:30.379]  I got an email saying, you got that from V for Vendetta.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.000]  No, you got it backwards.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.162]  It's art imitating life, not life imitating art.
[00:14:38.479 --> 00:14:39.119]  You understand?
[00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:45.043]  I mean, I know most listeners are smarter than I am, but some of them out there just can't get it.
[00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:48.145]  I got emails, I've got many emails and calls over the years.
[00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:49.926]  You're making up Skull and Bones.
[00:14:49.966 --> 00:14:50.627]  It doesn't exist.
[00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:53.048]  You got it from that movie, Skulls.
[00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:59.212]  No, Skulls is based on Skull and Bones.
[00:15:01.194 --> 00:15:07.818]  Alex, you got the claim the government remote-controlled the jet aircraft from a Lone Gun the Next Files episode.
[00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:15.938]  It's the same thing over and over again, but a bird flu strain not dangerous to people in New Jersey market.
[00:15:15.978 --> 00:15:28.247]  A strain of bird flu not dangerous to people turned up at a live poultry market in South Jersey during routine testing last week and samples are undergoing further tests the State Department of Agriculture said.
[00:15:29.168 --> 00:15:36.654]  Preliminary tests from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory show the samples taken from birds the live poultry market in Camden County did not have
[00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:39.048]  N1 type of virus.
[00:15:39.068 --> 00:15:40.769]  So it's not even in the whole N1 category.
[00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:46.011]  The bird flu strain that has spread to 45 countries killed more than 110 people since 2003.
[00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:48.812]  I think it's 120 last time I checked.
[00:15:49.452 --> 00:15:55.074]  And sparked fears of a deadly pandemic called H5N1.
[00:15:56.254 --> 00:15:59.715]  So again, there's hundreds of these viruses, but this isn't even an N1 variant.
[00:16:02.384 --> 00:16:08.469]  Anything that was sold, if it was properly cooked and handled, it would not be of any consequence to humans at Agriculture Department spokesman.
[00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:09.230]  It goes on and on.
[00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.332]  But at first, see, they were reporting, there may be a bird flu.
[00:16:12.813 --> 00:16:14.014]  Bird, bird flu!
[00:16:14.815 --> 00:16:21.800]  You read this AP article from yesterday, they've got ABC producers of the stupid TV show saying, oh, we're getting you ready for the bird flu.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.082]  This is kind of a public service announcement.
[00:16:24.102 --> 00:16:29.447]  See, they admit it's propaganda to position you psychologically to accept what they plan to do.
[00:16:31.036 --> 00:16:32.737]  And SARS was a dress rehearsal.
[00:16:32.777 --> 00:16:34.278]  Smallpox was a dress rehearsal.
[00:16:34.998 --> 00:16:40.101]  This now year-plus hype of bird flu may be a dress rehearsal.
[00:16:40.461 --> 00:16:48.965]  But I'm telling you, one day they're going to let out of the box some type of super bio-weapon and use that to bring in martial law, a la V for Vendetta.
[00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:51.786]  Now how many years?
[00:16:52.427 --> 00:16:57.990]  It's got to be about eight, nine years since I figured out they're going to use that that's on the table, that that's on the front burner.
[00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.631]  It's one of the tools they have
[00:17:01.596 --> 00:17:03.257]  To bring in martial law in this country.
[00:17:03.977 --> 00:17:09.038]  Remember, I'm the weirdo who made films eight years ago about martial law.
[00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.700]  I'm the weirdo for twelve years that's been talking about martial law.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.300]  Yes, we're coming up on twelve years on the year.
[00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:26.344]  I'm the weirdo who's running around concerned about these issues because I read federal documents, I went to urban warfare training grills,
[00:17:27.683 --> 00:17:42.395]  Old-timers in and out of government warn me about this and I saw the indicators and I'm somewhat of a student of history, Soviet history, Nazi history, Roman history, and I know what preparations for an authoritarian police state look like and baby, this is it!
[00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:48.821]  But they've got to have a reason, a smoke screen, an excuse to sell you on it.
[00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:54.806]  And they can use rioting third world
[00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:05.480]  Attack dog populations to trigger a crisis, burn every American city, the globalists can give the order and it will happen overnight.
[00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:11.208]  With our friendly 25 million frothing illegal aliens and their supporters, another 10 million or so.
[00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:17.640]  So, you start looking at that, the globalists can set off an A-bomb.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:29.785]  Oh, don't think they won't vaporize a third of the city, and kill 400,000 people, 300,000 people, and radiate another couple million right in front of you, and re-engineer our entire lifestyle, our entire world, our entire freedoms.
[00:18:30.465 --> 00:18:42.670]  Don't think they won't attack Iran, and then detonate a nuke on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, or a dirty bomb, and claim that Iran launched it, and frankly, Iran may launch something on their own.
[00:18:43.484 --> 00:18:44.485]  I mean, we only have the U.S.
[00:18:44.545 --> 00:18:46.526]  and Israel and others threatening to attack them every day.
[00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:47.827]  And again, I'm not defending Israel.
[00:18:48.187 --> 00:18:49.407]  I'm not defending Iran.
[00:18:50.248 --> 00:18:51.749]  I'm not defending any of these people.
[00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.111]  They're all controlled by the globalists at one level or another.
[00:18:56.431 --> 00:19:00.394]  Don't forget, Iran did the whole hostage scam.
[00:19:00.434 --> 00:19:05.977]  Iran-Contra for a bunch of missiles and cash and stuff from the CIA.
[00:19:06.777 --> 00:19:11.220]  They held the hostages and the day Reagan took office, they released them.
[00:19:12.313 --> 00:19:14.595]  And admittedly, that's now admitted, that was staged!
[00:19:15.935 --> 00:19:28.784]  Don't forget our CIA sent, what, Clinton sent $45 million to Iran, another $30-something million to Albania, to send in Osama Bin Laden to attack the Serbs, Serbs fight back, and oh my gosh, they're engaging in genocide.
[00:19:29.344 --> 00:19:33.687]  Oh, but it's Slobo's bad, because he's fighting Al-Syiedah.
[00:19:35.809 --> 00:19:42.053]  But, but, imagine, bird flu, being released,
[00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:48.554]  There could just be a few hundred deaths and it would bring America to its knees because the media will hype it and use it.
[00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:54.456]  We'll come back, get into the illegal aliens and some of the things that happened yesterday.
[00:19:54.476 --> 00:19:57.538]  Got an important guest coming up, stay with us.
[00:20:01.641 --> 00:20:03.943]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:04.043 --> 00:20:09.387]  Did you know executive orders and other laws have already been passed that can create a legal dictatorship in America?
[00:20:09.887 --> 00:20:26.880]  These laws can affect you by seizing all communication media, all electric power, fuel, minerals, food supplies, and resources, all farms and farm equipment, all means of transportation including personal vehicles, total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.922]  Seize all American people for workforces.
[00:20:30.817 --> 00:20:33.219]  These laws extend to all parts of our life.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:41.326]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:06.804]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:22:07.004 --> 00:22:09.085]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:16.467]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:22:16.567 --> 00:22:28.091]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:22:28.491 --> 00:22:35.854]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:41.115]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[00:22:41.275 --> 00:22:46.257]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[00:22:46.737 --> 00:22:51.258]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:23:15.629 --> 00:23:17.791]  Poison of globalism is nationalism.
[00:23:18.192 --> 00:23:20.234]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[00:23:20.475 --> 00:23:25.881]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:34.891]  Published monthly since 1985, The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[00:23:35.191 --> 00:23:35.411]  We're good.
[00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:12.454]  Every major U.S.
[00:24:12.754 --> 00:24:28.647]  city, hundreds and hundreds yesterday, saw hordes of foreigners stomping around who've been served down American flags by Bush and Vicente Fox's PR firm.
[00:24:28.947 --> 00:24:32.090]  That's mainstream news, but the average American isn't even aware of it.
[00:24:32.924 --> 00:24:37.648]  And by that, this stuff gets reported, it's there if you know where to look, but it should be top story.
[00:24:38.209 --> 00:24:45.535]  And we have written several on the subject that are on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, but see, Neocon talk show host won't talk about it.
[00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:53.622]  They'll whine about the open border all day, but then say Bush is good when Bush is the one that wants the blanket total amnesty in the name of the guest worker program.
[00:24:54.603 --> 00:24:55.944]  And I've read the proposed program.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.664]  Unlimited foreigners who are in this country or who can get to this country for six years will be legalized.
[00:25:05.284 --> 00:25:09.026]  The amnesty in, what, 86 was only for one year.
[00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:16.928]  And the Border Patrol and Border Sheriffs, I was just talking to one this morning, are reporting record levels.
[00:25:16.968 --> 00:25:18.628]  They've never seen it.
[00:25:19.028 --> 00:25:28.651]  Deputies who are now sheriffs or in the press, who've been working for different departments for over 20 years, have never seen it at this level.
[00:25:30.584 --> 00:25:36.049]  Mexican TV is openly telling their people, get up here, this is Mexico, re-colonize.
[00:25:36.069 --> 00:25:38.751]  Do you understand that's on Mexican TV in the U.S.
[00:25:39.252 --> 00:25:40.313]  and of course in Mexico?
[00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:45.177]  They're saying, this is Mexico, you have a right to be there, take that over, it's for the pride of your country!
[00:25:46.098 --> 00:25:52.363]  And Mexico is just dumping its poor, its population that doubles every 35 years, is dumping them here.
[00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:56.369]  And they're all pouring in, driving down the wages.
[00:25:56.429 --> 00:25:58.669]  Some of our cities, some areas of L.A.
[00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:00.630]  are going to look like Mexico City soon.
[00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.491]  If you haven't been to Mexico City, folks, don't go, but it's a hellhole.
[00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:10.352]  And again, I'm not against these poor people who do want, quote, a better way of life.
[00:26:11.552 --> 00:26:15.733]  The problem is once they get here, they're indoctrinated, not just by the Spanish media, but by our own media.
[00:26:16.408 --> 00:26:29.317]  And they're given welfare, they're given tuition, and in many states at higher levels than citizens even get, and the amount of contribution they make to the economy is totally outweighed by the incredible social services cost, and that's admitted.
[00:26:31.158 --> 00:26:42.226]  It's looting and wrecking this country, and now even Lou Dobbs admitted last night that the La Reconquista, Mecha, and La Raza type groups totally control these organizations.
[00:26:43.024 --> 00:26:43.405]  Met you!
[00:26:43.465 --> 00:26:44.666]  For the race, everything.
[00:26:44.706 --> 00:26:46.668]  For those outside the race, nothing!
[00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:56.339]  In fact, yesterday I was listening to Jack Bloodshow that comes on after this broadcast, and he did two hours live down there via cell phone, taking callers and talking to people on the streets.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.525]  Cops were coming over to people saying, you can't have cameras, turn them off, you can't videotape the demonstrations.
[00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:02.827]  This was confirmed and witnessed.
[00:27:03.547 --> 00:27:24.125]  I mean, just amazing, the cops working with the illegals, the illegals up there saying, we want to thank Matt General Raza, and now several big websites are going through and translating what's being said in Spanish, and it's, we're going to get the gringos, go home, we're taking over, plan of San Diego.
[00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:29.790]  Gutierrez up at UT Arlington openly says in English, kill all the gringos.
[00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:37.177]  In fact, he's shifted gears in the last year from saying all males 16 and older, all white males, must die.
[00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:42.822]  I guess the women could live, and I guess if they can be re-educated, the young ringos.
[00:27:43.243 --> 00:27:46.486]  And again, I'm supposed to sit here and go, Oh, I love you!
[00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:48.468]  You say you want to kill me!
[00:27:48.488 --> 00:27:50.069]  Oh, I love you!
[00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:51.871]  Thank you!
[00:27:52.972 --> 00:27:53.913]  It's just not going to happen.
[00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:57.720]  And I'm seeing even all these liberal publications starting to panic.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:07.787]  Even Colbert, in his report yesterday on Comedy Central, was talking about Bush diversions and said, don't worry about the invasion of America and the illegal aliens.
[00:28:08.908 --> 00:28:11.850]  I almost fell over this morning when I was watching the clip online.
[00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.611]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:15.332 --> 00:28:21.797]  Even liberal publications, even the San Francisco Chronicle starting to panic over the illegal aliens because, man, it's not good for America.
[00:28:22.742 --> 00:28:25.123]  America's like a lifeboat that's saying it can take a hundred people.
[00:28:25.724 --> 00:28:27.004]  And we're trying to put five hundred in it.
[00:28:27.485 --> 00:28:28.285]  It's gonna sink.
[00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:37.671]  And when you prove what you can do, that Bush and Fox and a big, fancy Republican PR firm are running all of this.
[00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:44.234]  You know, Dobbs talked about radical groups controlling it and claimed liberal groups like Answer are controlling the illegals.
[00:28:44.494 --> 00:28:45.415]  That is baloney.
[00:28:46.539 --> 00:28:49.761]  Again, nothing against Dobbs, but why don't you go with the juggler Dobbs?
[00:28:50.301 --> 00:28:53.422]  Why don't you talk about how it's controlled by Mecha and La Raza?
[00:28:53.702 --> 00:28:55.763]  Why don't you go to the Dallas Morning News and L.A.
[00:28:55.803 --> 00:28:59.905]  Times from four months ago where they said, Rob Allen and co.
[00:28:59.965 --> 00:29:14.032]  out of Dallas that ran Bush's presidential campaign as gubernatorial and ran Fox's campaign secretly is going to stage demonstrations nationwide to defeat legislation and try to get other legislation brought forward to legalize the estimated 14 million illegals in America.
[00:29:14.612 --> 00:29:15.433]  Again, that number is really 25 million.
[00:29:17.273 --> 00:29:23.617]  But the point is, is it's all right there, back in December of last year, but no one now will report on it.
[00:29:24.397 --> 00:29:25.598]  We are reporting on it.
[00:29:25.618 --> 00:29:28.279]  They did exactly what they promised.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:35.103]  And now, rock-throwing report in Santa Ana, they attack police, and the cops were ordered to stand there and take it.
[00:29:35.964 --> 00:29:43.068]  You so much as stick your tongue out at a cop at a land rights meeting, you'll be lucky if you're not scooping your brains up off the ground from a baton.
[00:29:44.423 --> 00:29:45.804]  But you're an illegal alien?
[00:29:45.844 --> 00:29:48.285]  You can knock them upside the head with beer bottles!
[00:29:51.906 --> 00:29:52.846]  We're on the march.

[00:33:33.326 --> 00:33:35.327]  Impeaching Bush state-by-state.
[00:33:36.148 --> 00:33:40.691]  Forget bird flu, impeachment is spreading across the nation state-by-state.
[00:33:40.831 --> 00:33:49.196]  On Tuesday afternoon, Representative Dave Zuckerman dropped the third of three nearly unreported bombshells on the Bush administration.
[00:33:50.077 --> 00:33:57.242]  Zuckerman, along with 12 fellow lawmakers, introduced a formal resolution for the Vermont State Legislature to call on the U.S.
[00:33:57.282 --> 00:34:00.964]  House of Representatives to impeach President George W. Bush.
[00:34:01.621 --> 00:34:04.163]  There are now, what, three other states that are considering this.
[00:34:04.643 --> 00:34:10.186]  Now, but this is the first state, I believe, to go on the record and begin those proceedings.
[00:34:11.607 --> 00:34:13.809]  There are several ways impeachment can be initiated.
[00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:20.553]  In the House of Representatives, or it can be initiated by a single state or multiple states.
[00:34:21.073 --> 00:34:23.534]  And this goes back to the Constitution and the Electoral College.
[00:34:23.875 --> 00:34:26.416]  The real power resides with the states.
[00:34:28.578 --> 00:34:30.779]  In fact, that's why we have a 10th Amendment.
[00:34:32.142 --> 00:34:36.403]  And now we are joined by Representative Dave Zuckerman.
[00:34:36.423 --> 00:34:38.063]  Thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[00:34:38.363 --> 00:34:39.484]  Thank you for the opportunity.
[00:34:40.004 --> 00:34:40.284]  You bet.
[00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:53.187]  Tell us a little bit about what you guys are doing in Vermont and about why you're moving to try to have Bush impeached and what that process may look like if your state formally passes it.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.880]  Well, a couple things.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.782]  I'd like to give you a little bit of an update that we actually have 24 co-sponsors along with myself.
[00:34:59.862 --> 00:35:02.943]  So we got a few more before we finally got it turned in.
[00:35:04.164 --> 00:35:07.325]  And that was pretty satisfying in large part.
[00:35:08.145 --> 00:35:18.949]  The history of this came from county Democratic committees around the state starting this process based on the Jefferson Manual, Section 603, where this could start in the states.
[00:35:19.649 --> 00:35:22.470]  The Democratic Party, sort of powerful folks in the state,
[00:35:23.351 --> 00:35:37.823]  Decided to squish it and say, you know, just because our grassroots folks want this doesn't mean we want it in the legislature and politics because it'll get too partisan and too mucky and we're near the end of the session and so we're just going to write a letter to the president and to our congresspeople.
[00:35:38.992 --> 00:35:56.968]  I did sign that letter as well, but I also felt that there are a lot of folks in the state who understand what this president has done with particularly the Foreign Intelligence Services Act and sort of walking over that with the illegal surveillance of our phone conversations.
[00:35:57.608 --> 00:36:04.114]  Certainly other information that they've used either selectively or at best and misleading at worst.
[00:36:05.746 --> 00:36:11.768]  to lie to the American public about certain circumstances around the world and Iraq and others to start this process.
[00:36:12.088 --> 00:36:29.293]  And so a number of people, like I said, 25 of us signed on and it's been sent to the House Judiciary Committee where at this point they have not scheduled any hearings for it and in all likelihood they probably won't, which as you can imagine is relatively frustrating given the
[00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:38.468]  Does it have to go to committee to be able to be brought before the full legislature?
[00:36:48.337 --> 00:36:54.981]  Any bill or resolution can ultimately be what's called pulled from committee or moved to the floor.
[00:36:55.101 --> 00:36:59.003]  What party controls, I would imagine Democrats, what party controls that committee?
[00:36:59.143 --> 00:37:01.705]  Democrats control both the House and the Senate in Vermont.
[00:37:01.725 --> 00:37:02.906]  We have a Republican governor.
[00:37:03.246 --> 00:37:05.787]  So I want to illustrate this.
[00:37:06.188 --> 00:37:10.030]  Now a few months ago I remember having the citizen group on
[00:37:11.354 --> 00:37:15.138]  From Vermont, just a few citizens got together and started with two guys.
[00:37:15.578 --> 00:37:17.681]  Then they went to some of their local city councils.
[00:37:19.162 --> 00:37:20.764]  They got resolutions passed there.
[00:37:21.164 --> 00:37:23.346]  Now a few months later, you've taken action.
[00:37:24.027 --> 00:37:32.876]  You've got over 20 co-sponsors to this, but there are the Democrats defending George W. Bush as usual.
[00:37:32.956 --> 00:37:34.558]  So how is this going to play out?
[00:37:35.347 --> 00:37:36.548]  Well, it's interesting.
[00:37:36.608 --> 00:37:40.031]  In Vermont, as you may or may not be aware, we actually have a third party.
[00:37:40.051 --> 00:37:41.312]  I'm a member of that third party.
[00:37:41.332 --> 00:37:42.533]  It's called the Progressive Party.
[00:37:43.253 --> 00:37:45.635]  And we may or may not agree on other things.
[00:37:45.675 --> 00:37:54.782]  I don't know all the aspects of your show and your listeners, but with this situation, sometimes there's enough tension and pressure on the Democrats to maybe actually do something.
[00:37:56.283 --> 00:37:57.825]  I'm not sure that's going to happen this year.
[00:37:57.865 --> 00:37:59.306]  We're in our last week of this session.
[00:37:59.766 --> 00:38:04.550]  We'll be adjourning with a budget probably on Friday or Saturday, and then we're done until January.
[00:38:05.134 --> 00:38:13.177]  And one of the things I want to make sure people are aware of, too, is you don't just start the impeachment process because you don't like someone's policies one way or the other.
[00:38:13.657 --> 00:38:14.818]  I didn't particularly like Bill Clinton.
[00:38:14.838 --> 00:38:17.939]  You need to have hearings to bring forward and demonstrate the evidence.
[00:38:18.279 --> 00:38:20.360]  Well, absolutely, but also just as a public.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.221]  I mean, President Clinton also got impeached.
[00:38:22.879 --> 00:38:26.003]  Again, I think that was mostly because of people not liking his policies.
[00:38:26.043 --> 00:38:29.528]  There's a lot of people that are behind this effort because they don't like the President's policies.
[00:38:29.548 --> 00:38:35.315]  And we all need to remember that this process and the states' rights that were established through the Constitution and with these kinds of rules
[00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:39.110]  It's not about whether you like someone's policies or not, that's what voting is about.
[00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:50.759]  No, it's about if someone is a repeated lawbreaker who openly is stating a new legal theorem that he is above the law with dictatorial powers on a host of issues.
[00:38:51.099 --> 00:39:04.370]  Well, we threw monarchies overboard a couple hundred years ago in the Boston Tea Party, and this is what we're trying to maintain is the rule of law in this country, and if the president feels they can
[00:39:04.986 --> 00:39:08.390]  But I think that's important so that the constituency knows what their representatives have done.
[00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:24.271]  Absolutely.
[00:39:24.792 --> 00:39:25.272]  Absolutely.
[00:39:25.552 --> 00:39:29.336]  And as far as I can tell, that's probably the only option we're going to have.
[00:39:29.477 --> 00:39:31.939]  Well, Bush has got about a 30% approval rating.
[00:39:31.979 --> 00:39:33.181]  Some polls show 27.
[00:39:33.241 --> 00:39:33.701]  Some show 33.
[00:39:34.162 --> 00:39:38.606]  So we'll average them together and take the mean and say it's 30.
[00:39:39.147 --> 00:39:40.869]  So it's wildly popular.
[00:39:40.949 --> 00:39:41.990]  It's constitutional.
[00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.911]  It makes total sense.
[00:39:42.971 --> 00:39:43.512]  I mean, Bush
[00:39:44.036 --> 00:39:50.418]  I don't know if you're aware of this, Representative, but he's been openly talking about martial law and how we may need to have troops on the streets.
[00:39:50.878 --> 00:39:53.799]  He was involved in ordering gun confiscation in New Orleans.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.721]  He tried to sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:57.941]  All of that is treasonous.
[00:39:58.201 --> 00:39:59.962]  He lied on Iraq intelligence.
[00:39:59.982 --> 00:40:01.602]  He said he was above the law on torture.
[00:40:02.102 --> 00:40:03.423]  He signed a two billion dollar
[00:40:04.554 --> 00:40:06.835]  Spending bill a few months ago that hadn't even passed.
[00:40:07.275 --> 00:40:11.497]  Congress, I mean, he has his top lawyers openly saying he's above the law.
[00:40:11.797 --> 00:40:12.918]  He must be removed.
[00:40:12.998 --> 00:40:33.087]  Ron Paul, congressman from Texas, has said that he believes that when the Democrats are swept into office, if we have a real election, which I always thought I'd be horrified of that, but even Ron Paul's a Republican and says it will be a good thing to stop this attempted dictatorship from forming so we can see impeachment proceedings as early as early next year.
[00:40:33.687 --> 00:40:36.690]  Well, you know, it depends who's in Congress, certainly in part.
[00:40:38.311 --> 00:40:39.131]  But not entirely.
[00:40:39.151 --> 00:40:47.718]  I mean, as you stated early on, sometimes the collusion between the two parties in Washington is frighteningly strong.
[00:40:48.158 --> 00:40:56.925]  And that's one of the reasons I argue, again, whether someone agrees with a particular party that we're forming here, but there's got to be more options than the two that are currently
[00:40:57.523 --> 00:41:00.210]  Well, I'm sure, Mr. Zuckerman, that you have worked in
[00:41:06.602 --> 00:41:22.936]  An office building before, where you go down to the vending machine area by the bathrooms and there's two or three choices, and the Republicans are one vending machine, say Coca-Cola, the Democrats are PepsiCo, the lobbyists put their quarters in or their dollars in, they pull the lever and get what they want.
[00:41:22.976 --> 00:41:30.183]  The level of corruption that is running rampant is unparalleled in modern American history or American history period.
[00:41:30.823 --> 00:41:32.784]  And look at Hillary, pro-war.
[00:41:32.804 --> 00:41:34.705]  Look at Schumer, pro-war.
[00:41:35.005 --> 00:41:38.647]  Look at Kerry saying he wants to attack Iran back during the presidential election.
[00:41:39.407 --> 00:41:40.128]  So I agree with you.
[00:41:40.168 --> 00:41:42.229]  We need a third party, a fourth party, or whatever.
[00:41:42.489 --> 00:41:49.552]  But we, number one, need to realize that the Congress, federally and at many state levels, is just intellectually bankrupt.
[00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:50.493]  Well, that's true.
[00:41:50.553 --> 00:41:54.595]  And ultimately, along with this impeachment resolution and this process,
[00:41:55.123 --> 00:42:01.945]  This is a process trying to solve a symptom of today's electoral problem, which is obviously this president feeling that he's above the law.
[00:42:02.265 --> 00:42:04.246]  But it doesn't really solve the underlying illness.
[00:42:04.826 --> 00:42:11.749]  And the underlying illness, as you pointed out, is the money influence in politics, and frankly, in my opinion, the electoral system that we have.
[00:42:12.249 --> 00:42:23.733]  With winner-take-all elections, you can't run, whether you're to the right or to the left, you can't run as a third-party person without the media and the parties themselves spending so much money calling you a spoiler, or, you know,
[00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:53.145]  Not viable that there's no way for for the general public to feel like you have a chance of winning And that's something I think people should look at from all ends of the political spectrum as well Whether you could rank your candidates for what's called instant runoff voting or other methods, but the inherent election system itself Which obviously as we all know is stolen by the Supreme Court in 2000 and obviously 2004 the elections were pretty much in question as well There's there are so many layers to this onion in terms of the problems that exist and
[00:42:53.675 --> 00:42:58.439]  And we're just exposing what, you know, the core of the onion is in this particular instance.
[00:42:58.519 --> 00:43:03.783]  But, you know, President Bush, there's an article I just was handed and I haven't had a chance to read it.
[00:43:03.803 --> 00:43:07.966]  It was in the Boston Sunday Globe on the 30th about how Bush has bypassed
[00:43:08.476 --> 00:43:09.377]  Hundreds of laws.
[00:43:09.397 --> 00:43:12.699]  Yeah, the headline is, Bush challenges hundreds of laws.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:20.726]  No, if you go criticize a law, you're challenging it, or if in court you challenge it, the headline should be, Bush breaks hundreds of laws.
[00:43:20.886 --> 00:43:24.209]  Right, well it says, the one I have says, Bush bypasses hundreds of laws.
[00:43:24.509 --> 00:43:31.895]  But he's challenged over 750 laws because he believes it's unconstitutional just by fiat, by being King Bush.
[00:43:32.435 --> 00:43:33.156]  And, you know,
[00:43:33.766 --> 00:43:38.769]  It's hundreds and hundreds more than any other president has done recently, as far as I know, in history.
[00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:44.373]  And this guy is on another planet, and he's getting away with it.
[00:43:44.873 --> 00:43:49.577]  And the folks... You know, when you look at polls, as you indicated, Bush is not particularly popular.
[00:43:49.677 --> 00:43:53.479]  Again, the reason to impeach someone is not due to popularity or not, it's because they broke the law.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:58.062]  But ultimately, if you look at Washington, the Democrats aren't particularly that popular either.
[00:43:58.182 --> 00:43:58.783]  Well, exactly.
[00:43:58.803 --> 00:43:59.663]  I mean, they're 45%, you know?
[00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:12.131]  You wonder, well wait a minute folks, when is the American public going to wake up to the fact that as long as we keep electing people from each of these two parties, we're going to keep getting the result that we're seeing.
[00:44:13.572 --> 00:44:21.718]  And, you know, we can do our best to try to impeach the President, but it's also going to take a public that's got some backbone to say, you know what, I'm not voting for either of these two anymore.
[00:44:21.738 --> 00:44:23.639]  I'm tired of these lack of choices.
[00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:29.163]  Well, Representative David Zuckerman, let's get down to brass tacks here.
[00:44:30.729 --> 00:44:54.139]  I have gotten so conditioned, so acclimated by election fraud, literally thousands of cases documented, admitted, with these electronic voting machines defrauding the public by design, their own engineers going public, intelligence agencies running them, the Republican Party hiring thugs to jam phone banks.
[00:44:55.139 --> 00:44:59.441]  I mean, there are thousands of Watergate-scale
[00:45:00.672 --> 00:45:13.337]  Scandals, armies of local corrupt technicians, stealing votes, the Help America Vote Act, over six billion dollars to put in these federally controlled systems.
[00:45:13.837 --> 00:45:17.279]  I think it's darker and later than you are even saying, sir.
[00:45:17.659 --> 00:45:19.080]  Well, I don't disagree with you.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:25.342]  I mean, the problem is massive, and it's certainly a long way along in its progress.
[00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:26.523]  I mean, this cancer is
[00:45:28.044 --> 00:45:29.165]  Very progressed, as one would say.
[00:45:29.185 --> 00:45:43.391]  And it's so bad, sir, that every day I see maybe ten articles that are mainstream news, but again, are only regional, never get picked up nationally, so people just see those few articles locally and don't get the big picture, to where I don't even cover it anymore.
[00:45:43.451 --> 00:45:52.855]  I mean, the level of wild corruption and... Well, you know, the only way to, in my opinion, the only way to change it is to start locally.
[00:45:53.447 --> 00:46:00.910]  You know, one of the things that frustrates me about so much of what we get wrapped up in elections is- We get 60% turnout for the- That's right.
[00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:11.253]  We get all this turnout and all this attention when there's a presidential election, and then every other fall, you know, with the congressional elections, and then, you know, a little less so in our local elections.
[00:46:11.773 --> 00:46:15.254]  It all starts locally, and we can start to change some of those laws.
[00:46:15.295 --> 00:46:16.615]  Like I said earlier, here in Vermont,
[00:46:17.179 --> 00:46:21.743]  We are on the verge, we're not there yet, of changing our voting system where you rank your candidates.
[00:46:21.763 --> 00:46:23.004]  It's called instant runoff voting.
[00:46:23.384 --> 00:46:25.706]  You pick your first choice and then your second and your third.
[00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:35.513]  So you can vote for whomever you want without the risk of getting the bad guy that, you know, you're afraid of if you're a Democrat or a Republican and you're afraid of the other one.
[00:46:36.174 --> 00:46:40.397]  And things like that will allow for folks to speak the truth.
[00:46:41.117 --> 00:46:44.320]  Because you can speak the truth, you're no longer a spoiler, you no longer have to
[00:46:44.815 --> 00:46:46.657]  Well, I've actually got the national averages here in my brain.
[00:47:06.044 --> 00:47:09.725]  But the last presidential election we had about a 61% turnout.
[00:47:10.545 --> 00:47:13.765]  On average, a local election has around an 8% turnout.
[00:47:14.205 --> 00:47:17.826]  The power is at the state and county and city level.
[00:47:18.006 --> 00:47:33.329]  It's on the water boards, it's on the school boards, and if the citizens would get focused on that and get informed, just pick a few issues, get informed, go get involved, run themselves, and then be obstructionist, block big government, block loss of freedom,
[00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:35.810]  Fair it out and expose corruption.
[00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:37.511]  Use the office as a bully pulpit.
[00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:44.074]  They will then be loved and can move up through the ranks into higher level office and then do even more good.
[00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:52.478]  I mean, Ron Paul and a few others in Congress that are good have proven with, you know, record re-election numbers, record poll numbers.
[00:47:52.859 --> 00:47:55.000]  Congress has like a 25% approval rating.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:58.161]  Ron Paul's got like a, what, 69% approval rating.
[00:47:58.882 --> 00:48:03.364]  So literally, folks, you can win if you just take action.
[00:48:03.908 --> 00:48:11.835]  Well, that's right, and one of the things you mentioned earlier in terms of the President with martial law and other areas where he's taken away people's guns, just the right to assemble.
[00:48:12.175 --> 00:48:18.781]  When you look at when people assembled around the World Trade Organization meetings, both in Seattle and other places... Yeah, look at the free speech zone!
[00:48:18.821 --> 00:48:31.071]  Sir, we were down... This whole thing, well, obviously, I guess we're in agreement here, you know, where they say, well, you can assemble, but you've got to do it over in this park five miles away from where the event is, and we're going to put a little fence around you with hundreds and hundreds of armed... Serbs?
[00:48:31.851 --> 00:48:45.659]  We had camera people down at the big immigration rally at the Capitol, three miles from where I sit, and the cops documented, were coming over to peaceful reporters with video cameras saying, turn those off, get out of here, go get in the free speech zone.
[00:48:45.859 --> 00:48:46.260]  That's right.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.083]  And of course they said no, go ahead and arrest me, and the cops backed off, but it's already happening where they do arrest you.
[00:48:52.103 --> 00:49:00.428]  Well that's right, and you know that you have the right to do that, and a lot of other folks who get involved with rallies like this and others,
[00:49:01.053 --> 00:49:02.453]  Don't know your protections.
[00:49:02.733 --> 00:49:11.195]  And then, by the way, because most people follow the cop's orders, that psychologically tells the cop that what they're doing is okay, and then reaffirms it.
[00:49:11.995 --> 00:49:13.035]  No, police!
[00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:14.275]  That's commie China!
[00:49:14.576 --> 00:49:18.116]  And a lot of people also don't have someone watching their back.
[00:49:18.276 --> 00:49:27.758]  I mean, if you, you know, if Alex Jones was taken to, um, in for having a camera, you know you've got other people that are going to sit there and do the legal fight to get you out.
[00:49:28.314 --> 00:49:36.103]  A lot of everyday people who come out to a rally like this, they don't have a team of people that are involved with either their production or what they're doing.
[00:49:36.587 --> 00:49:38.807]  You know, it's extremely intimidating for a lot of people.
[00:49:38.828 --> 00:49:39.668]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:49:39.728 --> 00:49:41.648]  And so they're trying to steal our votes.
[00:49:41.988 --> 00:49:43.208]  They're trying to take control of that.
[00:49:43.348 --> 00:49:44.069]  Caught red-handed.
[00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:47.649]  They're trying to restrict our free speech and our capacity to demonstrate.
[00:49:47.709 --> 00:49:48.050]  That's right.
[00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:53.811]  I mean, at every level, they are just wholesale dismantling the Bill of Rights, Representative.
[00:49:54.031 --> 00:49:56.851]  But the good news is, people like you are leading the charge.
[00:49:57.111 --> 00:50:03.893]  I believe, unless there's another terror attack, which would certainly help them, the establishment, I believe Bush will be impeached.
[00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:06.409]  I don't doubt that.
[00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:10.052]  Sadly, it's still three more years of this guy in the presidency.
[00:50:10.532 --> 00:50:19.298]  I don't know exactly how he got re-elected in the first place, although I think we've already touched on that whole issue of the voting machines and access to voting and so forth.
[00:50:19.698 --> 00:50:22.400]  But I don't disagree with you at all.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:28.564]  I think this guy has built up such a pile of evidence against him that it is just a matter of time.
[00:50:28.584 --> 00:50:30.185]  But it takes people organizing.
[00:50:30.205 --> 00:50:32.386]  It takes people calling their representatives.
[00:50:32.406 --> 00:50:33.407]  Like I said, I've got
[00:50:33.988 --> 00:50:37.310]  Uh, twenty-five co-sponsors, but, you know, we still have another year.
[00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:38.750]  Representative, stay there.
[00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:43.332]  Will you come back and tell us, maybe dig up the phone number so we can call this committee?
[00:50:44.013 --> 00:50:44.293]  Sure.
[00:50:44.673 --> 00:50:50.696]  Okay, let's do five more minutes, or just about three other minutes on the other side, but, uh, this is so important.
[00:50:51.636 --> 00:50:53.037]  This is for all the marbles.
[00:50:53.157 --> 00:50:56.318]  Look, Ron Paul's got the most conservative voting record in Congress.
[00:50:56.818 --> 00:50:59.299]  He says it'll be a good thing if Bush gets impeached.
[00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:00.220]  He needs to be.
[00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.833]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.113 --> 00:51:07.674]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.015 --> 00:51:12.699]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.039 --> 00:51:17.463]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.884 --> 00:51:22.108]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.308 --> 00:51:25.131]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.251 --> 00:51:27.713]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:27.913 --> 00:51:28.474]  We're good to go.
[00:51:52.756 --> 00:51:56.121]  That's InfoWars.com or AAA-253-3139.
[00:51:56.201 --> 00:51:59.667]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:08.309]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:08.469 --> 00:52:14.632]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:14.913 --> 00:52:23.338]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:23.598 --> 00:52:30.602]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.922 --> 00:52:35.745]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.965 --> 00:52:41.329]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:41.709 --> 00:52:44.771]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:45.112 --> 00:52:53.077]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.117 --> 00:52:53.697]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.585 --> 00:53:03.905]  I think so.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.480]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.337 --> 00:53:51.439]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:57.562]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:06.386 --> 00:54:11.249]  Not since the Civil War has the federal government declared absolute dictatorial violence.
[00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:13.290]  And what's happening?
[00:54:14.099 --> 00:54:19.361]  They're war profiteering, they're looting, they're stealing, they're engaging in crimes in front of us at every level.
[00:54:21.803 --> 00:54:23.683]  If you study the policy, there's no doubting it.
[00:54:23.743 --> 00:54:25.264]  We're going into dictatorship.
[00:54:25.304 --> 00:54:27.725]  And I mean a dictatorship of this plutocracy.
[00:54:28.145 --> 00:54:30.546]  The elite, the controls, Bush, the Democrats, all of them.
[00:54:31.607 --> 00:54:34.128]  And they openly are stating they're going to take your pension funds.
[00:54:34.528 --> 00:54:37.570]  They're openly stating that they have already devalued the dollar by over 40%.
[00:54:38.826 --> 00:54:41.967]  They're openly stating they're going to jack up a whole bunch of different taxes.
[00:54:42.808 --> 00:54:44.969]  Final segment with Representative Dave Zuckerman.
[00:54:45.009 --> 00:54:52.111]  You can go to Infowars.com and link through to the legislature's website and to some of the news stories that have been written about what they're doing.
[00:54:52.852 --> 00:54:56.873]  If you live in Vermont or anywhere around Vermont, nationwide, you need to support this man.
[00:54:57.594 --> 00:55:03.276]  How do we get on the horn and tell this committee to do the right thing?
[00:55:03.866 --> 00:55:04.446]  Sure, thank you.
[00:55:04.466 --> 00:55:05.507]  There's a couple things.
[00:55:05.747 --> 00:55:13.809]  One is I can give you the website for the legislature in general, so you can track both the legislation itself and who is on the committee.
[00:55:14.229 --> 00:55:22.152]  And that's just www.leg.state.vt.us.
[00:55:22.212 --> 00:55:24.052]  It's pretty common in a lot of different states.
[00:55:24.552 --> 00:55:29.614]  And if you go there, you can find out how to track the resolution, which is the Joint House Resolution No.
[00:55:29.634 --> 00:55:29.614]  75.
[00:55:29.974 --> 00:55:32.855]  You can also find out who the committee members are.
[00:55:33.251 --> 00:55:36.333]  Because we have one central switchboard where they take messages for all of us.
[00:55:36.373 --> 00:55:42.236]  We've got a much smaller legislature than you in Texas, and we haven't got individual staff or anything like that.
[00:55:42.316 --> 00:55:43.677]  How many members of the legislature?
[00:55:43.917 --> 00:55:44.638]  The same as you've got.
[00:55:44.658 --> 00:55:46.419]  150 House and 30 Senate.
[00:55:46.699 --> 00:55:48.941]  So if you've already got 20-something, you're doing good.
[00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:49.821]  We're doing pretty well.
[00:55:49.941 --> 00:55:50.822]  You want to give that number out?
[00:55:50.842 --> 00:55:51.002]  Yep.
[00:55:51.062 --> 00:55:53.143]  The phone number for the central switchboard is 802-828-2228.
[00:55:53.163 --> 00:55:54.884]  So I'll say that again.
[00:55:54.904 --> 00:55:55.044]  It's 802-828-2228.
[00:56:03.272 --> 00:56:10.399]  2228.
[00:56:04.013 --> 00:56:10.399]  And like I said, you know, well I didn't say this, but sometimes you get calls from all over the country as a legislator here.
[00:56:11.481 --> 00:56:13.623]  You don't always return all those calls, as you can imagine.
[00:56:13.763 --> 00:56:16.546]  Folks tend to focus on the ones that are from within the state.
[00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:20.930]  So if people know folks in Vermont and can get Vermonters to call, that's particularly helpful.
[00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:22.291]  And the committee is?
[00:56:22.472 --> 00:56:23.813]  It's a judiciary committee.
[00:56:25.031 --> 00:56:27.473]  Mr. Bill Lippert is the chair of that committee.
[00:56:27.533 --> 00:56:28.614]  Bill Lippert's the one then.
[00:56:28.854 --> 00:56:29.734]  We've got to let you go.
[00:56:29.754 --> 00:56:31.555]  I want to get you back on.
[00:56:31.896 --> 00:56:34.897]  Representative Zuckerman, as this develops, thanks for the time.
[00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:35.378]  Great.
[00:56:35.498 --> 00:56:36.198]  Thank you very much.
[00:56:36.358 --> 00:56:37.379]  God bless and take care.
[00:56:37.779 --> 00:56:39.160]  He's there at the legislature.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.241]  It's in session.
[00:56:40.281 --> 00:56:42.562]  He took time out to join us.
[00:56:43.083 --> 00:56:44.864]  I'm going to end this hour here in just a moment.
[00:56:44.884 --> 00:56:45.464]  We'll come back.
[00:56:45.504 --> 00:56:51.748]  We have another guest for 30 minutes concerning what's happening in New Hampshire, throwing out the National ID Card.
[00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:57.196]  And then for the second half of the broadcast, we'll be taking calls and covering a bunch of other news.
[00:56:58.057 --> 00:57:00.999]  I want to encourage you as the listeners to support this broadcast.
[00:57:01.019 --> 00:57:09.206]  You do that by, if you don't have an AM or FM station in your area, you're listening on satellite, shortwave, or internet, calling your local stations and telling them to pick up the broadcast.
[00:57:09.226 --> 00:57:13.290]  Then go to GCNlive.com and look at all the satellites and the affiliate relations agreements.
[00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.070]  It's very easy.
[00:57:15.612 --> 00:57:20.596]  And at the same time, you can also tell your email list or on your own website, tell folks about the show.
[00:57:21.582 --> 00:57:23.663]  That's really how we grow and how we reach more people.
[00:57:25.284 --> 00:57:28.886]  So we can tell them about how we're moving forward to try to impeach dictator Bush.
[00:57:29.566 --> 00:57:40.611]  And you can also go to the online video and book store at InfoWars.com on the secure online safe shopping cart and order my documentary films and the other books and videos.
[00:57:40.671 --> 00:57:44.533]  We carry a growing list every week and there's a lot of huge discounts.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:52.022]  There's the America's Hidden History DVD special, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings and the Order of Death DVD for $39.90.
[00:57:52.902 --> 00:58:00.964]  When you get those two DVDs, and that's already a $10 discount, you then get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the updated version, absolutely free.
[00:58:01.084 --> 00:58:04.305]  So, you already get a discount and you get a free DVD on top of it.
[00:58:05.205 --> 00:58:13.367]  There's the Terror USA special, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State DVD with 9-11 Synthetic Terror book by Webster Tarpley for $29.95.
[00:58:16.167 --> 00:58:16.567]  That's about a $15.

[00:58:46.063 --> 00:58:46.583]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.763 --> 00:58:47.564]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.584 --> 00:58:53.588]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.868 --> 00:58:56.429]  You want answers?
[00:58:56.810 --> 00:58:58.090]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.954 --> 00:59:09.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.137 --> 00:59:14.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.001 --> 00:59:23.608]  We'll get into more details in this hour about the giant illegal alien demonstration staged by the Bush administration and the government of Mexico yesterday.
[00:59:24.108 --> 00:59:28.332]  Some of the violence that broke out that's in local papers but hasn't hit the national news.
[00:59:29.292 --> 00:59:31.134]  There's also a new oil shock ahead.
[00:59:31.154 --> 00:59:32.695]  They're looking at $100 a barrel.
[00:59:32.715 --> 00:59:33.616]  That's the London Guardian.
[00:59:35.885 --> 00:59:43.087]  Chalibi, the guy that staged the intelligence out of that special Pentagon office Bush created, is backstaging Iran intelligence.
[00:59:43.867 --> 00:59:45.367]  Iran will hit Israel if U.S.
[00:59:45.407 --> 00:59:46.828]  does anything, quote, evil.
[00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:50.669]  And a story here out of the Denver Post, 666 cents.
[00:59:52.009 --> 00:59:53.970]  Date marked with caution.
[00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:57.370]  And we'll tell you what the Feds are saying about 666 coming up.
[00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:58.111]  6-6 of 0-6.
[01:00:01.182 --> 01:00:05.763]  Also Fox News attacking Stephen Colbert for his Correspondence Dinner comments.
[01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:06.503]  How dare him?
[01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:10.304]  Something I never got into a few days ago, but it's important.
[01:00:10.364 --> 01:00:12.725]  Mexico said to legalize pot, cocaine, heroin.
[01:00:12.745 --> 01:00:18.766]  I'm going to give you my take on that and a lot more coming up in this hour.
[01:00:19.346 --> 01:00:23.287]  Last hour we got into how they have a good chance in this session or the next session
[01:00:24.536 --> 01:00:31.741]  That starts in a few months, to be able to start the impeachment process at the state level in Vermont.
[01:00:33.603 --> 01:00:39.667]  Well, there's other good news, this time out of the live free or die state, and that's New Hampshire!
[01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:46.032]  House Bill 1582 has passed the legislature and is going to the governor.
[01:00:46.612 --> 01:00:54.616]  And this blocks the National ID Card, known as the Real ID Act, passed last year that federalizes state driver's licenses and puts them into a centralized database.
[01:00:54.656 --> 01:00:56.637]  Of course, illegal aliens are all exempt.
[01:00:57.597 --> 01:01:04.520]  And we are honored to be joined by State Representative Neil M. Kirk from the Live Free or Die State.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.741]  The bill is House Bill 1582.
[01:01:07.441 --> 01:01:08.722]  Representative, thank you for joining us.
[01:01:09.602 --> 01:01:11.083]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[01:01:12.123 --> 01:01:21.427]  We're about to break here in just a moment, and so we'll come back and recap, but please tell us how this legislation developed, and will the Governor sign it, and what it does exactly?
[01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.027]  I'd be glad to.
[01:01:23.148 --> 01:01:29.030]  First, it passed the House by a 70% margin, and it's now in the Senate.
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:34.552]  The Governor has said that if the Senate passes it, he will sign it, but it is not yet on his desk.
[01:01:34.772 --> 01:01:36.513]  Okay, excuse me, I'm misreading.
[01:01:37.856 --> 01:01:51.122]  The bill basically says the state of New Hampshire will not participate in the Real ID Act because the Real ID Act is a de facto national identification card masking as a state driver's license.
[01:01:51.583 --> 01:02:03.048]  And the people of New Hampshire, as you correctly called us, the live free or die state, didn't elect people to come to Concord to put a federally sponsored national identification card on them.
[01:02:03.635 --> 01:02:05.235]  We believe in individual liberties.
[01:02:05.536 --> 01:02:07.396]  We believe that the government serves us.
[01:02:07.936 --> 01:02:17.579]  We don't think that the government should be empowered to collect information about us, which this will facilitate, without our consent.
[01:02:17.699 --> 01:02:21.220]  It's not the kind of thing that we think is the American way.
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:29.822]  It reminds many of us of what happened in the Second World War, and indeed it happens in countries today where they have a papers-please mentality.
[01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:37.637]  The Real ID Act, in itself, is designed to provide security for driver's licenses, which everybody can support.
[01:02:37.657 --> 01:02:39.999]  Well, they have a paper, please, unless you're an illegal alien.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:47.563]  Well, the illegal aliens, of course, try to avoid being asked for papers, so I think your point is well taken.
[01:02:48.463 --> 01:02:52.826]  Technically, an illegal alien is not supposed to be able to get a driver's license.
[01:02:53.346 --> 01:03:00.750]  So, under any circumstances, if this bill works correctly, those folks will not get driver's licenses, but on the other hand, they don't need them to drive.
[01:03:02.392 --> 01:03:03.953]  As we all know, they drive without them.
[01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:05.555]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:07.056 --> 01:03:22.268]  So, what this bill will do is nothing to provide security for us in terms of terrorism, because terrorists will get passports from their home countries, and a passport from a home country entitles you to a real ID in the United States.
[01:03:23.749 --> 01:03:26.071]  And at the borders, as you well know,
[01:03:26.953 --> 01:03:31.797]  Illegal aliens are not going to bother to get one of these documents.
[01:03:31.817 --> 01:03:32.878]  Well, see, that's a key point.
[01:03:33.098 --> 01:03:36.640]  I mean, this is basically the guest worker program on top of it.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:43.866]  Another reason the REAL ID Act is so bad, because it allows any foreigner who wants to, to go ahead and get one of these, and then get welfare and everything else.
[01:03:44.346 --> 01:03:48.409]  But then if the illegals choose, they don't have to have this, or they can use a fake identity to get one.
[01:03:48.849 --> 01:03:50.110]  It actually makes us less secure.
[01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:51.231]  We'll be back with the state rep.
[01:03:53.712 --> 01:03:55.214]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.394 --> 01:03:58.477]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.617 --> 01:04:02.520]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.805]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:07.145 --> 01:04:10.908]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:12.950]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:16.394]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.414 --> 01:04:17.495]  The medical bills!
[01:04:19.096 --> 01:04:21.097]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.277 --> 01:04:24.299]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.479 --> 01:04:27.380]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.964]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.484 --> 01:04:38.286]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:38.686 --> 01:04:40.067]  Order your video today.
[01:04:40.467 --> 01:04:41.448]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:04:41.468 --> 01:04:43.488]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.509 --> 01:04:45.049]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:53.214 --> 01:04:56.695]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:56.955 --> 01:05:00.457]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.557 --> 01:05:04.498]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.718 --> 01:05:10.880]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:19.183]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.563 --> 01:05:19.984]  I think so.
[01:05:34.485 --> 01:05:35.246]  That's triple eight.
[01:05:35.266 --> 01:05:35.306]  803-4438.
[01:05:35.346 --> 01:05:36.007]  Protect your family.
[01:05:52.976 --> 01:05:53.816]  Come on, Bill.
[01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:59.198]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:05:59.538 --> 01:06:01.018]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:06:01.118 --> 01:06:03.099]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:06:03.379 --> 01:06:08.900]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:15.442]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:06:15.762 --> 01:06:17.982]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:06:18.282 --> 01:06:21.143]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[01:06:21.643 --> 01:06:25.086]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:06:25.326 --> 01:06:25.786]  Whoa!
[01:06:26.126 --> 01:06:27.347]  What was that website again?
[01:06:27.427 --> 01:06:30.910]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:32.331]  Now write this down, John.
[01:06:32.451 --> 01:06:36.754]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:06:36.914 --> 01:06:37.494]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:06:37.754 --> 01:06:38.975]  I'm going there right now.
[01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:40.016]  Check, please!
[01:06:41.794 --> 01:06:43.255]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:06:43.735 --> 01:06:44.335]  Sure, John.
[01:06:44.555 --> 01:06:48.896]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:49.216 --> 01:06:50.897]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:06:51.077 --> 01:06:51.417]  Deal.
[01:06:53.397 --> 01:06:58.439]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:01.140]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:06.601]  That's right, waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:07:06.621 --> 01:07:09.042]  In fact, Ron Paul has talked about how
[01:07:09.952 --> 01:07:20.380]  The REAL ID Act really is part of a Pan-American ID, because any of these foreigners who want it can apply and get it with their visas, with their passports.
[01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:24.283]  So it does that too, which I know is very conservative.
[01:07:24.343 --> 01:07:28.927]  Open borders, gun control, record spending.
[01:07:29.207 --> 01:07:30.388]  I know, I'm liberal, I understand.
[01:07:31.389 --> 01:07:32.990]  Because I actually defend the Bill of Rights.
[01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:39.495]  And then on top of it, it's going to track and trace citizens with the Total Information Awareness Network that just changed its name.
[01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:46.371]  And it's going to be used as a new national sales tax that a lot of other fake neocons are pushing.
[01:07:46.471 --> 01:07:47.651]  Oh, we need to get rid of the income tax.
[01:07:48.071 --> 01:07:48.591]  No, no, no, no.
[01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:49.872]  They're going to keep both.
[01:07:49.892 --> 01:07:51.612]  They're going to have the quote social security tax.
[01:07:51.672 --> 01:07:52.693]  It won't be called income tax.
[01:07:53.053 --> 01:07:54.433]  It'll be 12 to 15 percent.
[01:07:54.713 --> 01:07:57.334]  Then a nice 20 to 30 percent sales tax.
[01:07:57.694 --> 01:08:00.475]  By the time they're done jacking it up, you're going to love it.
[01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:03.896]  Five, ten years from now, you'll be saying, I wish I wouldn't have been conned.
[01:08:04.296 --> 01:08:06.037]  We got both these taxes now.
[01:08:06.617 --> 01:08:09.982]  And they're going to have a graduated sales tax and this is official.
[01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:16.051]  These are the federal plans and big industry symposiums they have that we've covered.
[01:08:17.273 --> 01:08:23.202]  When you go into say Target or Walmart or the Five and Dime, it brings federal control into every shopping cart, every terminal.
[01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:32.097]  You'll have to swipe your driver's license that doubles as a national ID card to decide what graduated sales tax you're in.
[01:08:32.117 --> 01:08:37.560]  Because if you make under, they're saying, $15,000 a year, you won't have to pay the sales tax.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.781]  But then it'll be graduated to be fair.
[01:08:41.122 --> 01:08:43.103]  But see, we can't have tax cheats.
[01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:47.485]  We're about to go back to our guest, the state rep, who's honored us by joining us.
[01:08:48.425 --> 01:09:00.999]  We can't have people who've got money fencing it through poor people that go in and make the purchases and so they get a lower sales tax rate of say twenty percent in some cases or higher.
[01:09:01.039 --> 01:09:05.644]  See that's a lot of money and so we'll have to... you think the IRS investigating is bad?
[01:09:05.984 --> 01:09:08.107]  Imagine all these new revenue officers
[01:09:09.047 --> 01:09:11.068]  With a database of everything you bought and sold.
[01:09:11.148 --> 01:09:13.389]  Oh, we show you bought too much for your income.
[01:09:13.769 --> 01:09:18.470]  You must be fencing goods with your sales tax.
[01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:24.292]  Oh, you must be having a second job of black market income.
[01:09:24.632 --> 01:09:26.913]  This is total transparent economy.
[01:09:27.273 --> 01:09:28.514]  The opposite of freedom.
[01:09:28.854 --> 01:09:32.175]  Big brother on a thousand injections of steroids.
[01:09:33.172 --> 01:09:36.094]  Alright, I'm ranting, but you read their plan.
[01:09:36.114 --> 01:09:43.078]  I mean, you go read the minutes of the RFID conference and conventions they have in Chicago and New York.
[01:09:43.238 --> 01:09:46.220]  They're just snickering and giggling about all this.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.163]  Going back to the wonderful state rep in the Live Free or Die state.
[01:09:51.183 --> 01:09:54.365]  By the way, I have an Infowars.com bumper sticker that says Live Free or Die.
[01:09:54.385 --> 01:09:55.546]  I've stolen that wonderful motto.
[01:09:56.718 --> 01:09:59.101]  It belongs to more than just Patrick Henry, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:59.701 --> 01:10:01.283]  They've introduced House Bill 1582.
[01:10:01.623 --> 01:10:07.009]  It's passed the House, it's in the Senate, and that is to throw out the National ID Card Real ID Act.
[01:10:07.049 --> 01:10:10.833]  Going back to Representative Neal M. Kirk, we're honored to have you, sir.
[01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:17.960]  Please give us more details of the legislation, and I've also heard now other states are thinking about following suit.
[01:10:19.702 --> 01:10:21.023]  The legislation is very simple.
[01:10:21.063 --> 01:10:21.764]  It's a paragraph.
[01:10:21.824 --> 01:10:28.487]  It simply says we will not participate in the National ID Program as implemented through the Real ID Act.
[01:10:28.888 --> 01:10:38.313]  But I did think, Alex, that I was hearing about a state that I certainly wouldn't want to live in, as you described some of the things that might happen.
[01:10:38.493 --> 01:10:44.957]  I'd just like to make it clear that these are possibilities, some of which have been discussed, as you've suggested,
[01:10:45.849 --> 01:10:47.050]  Others are conjecture.
[01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:59.475]  The point of the Real ID Act, and the reason why we're so concerned about it in New Hampshire, is that while it does none of those things, it makes any or all of those things possible.
[01:10:59.615 --> 01:11:12.741]  What it does is to set up the framework, specifically common data elements, a machine-readable technology yet to be determined, which could be RFID chips or smart chips or something else, and
[01:11:13.662 --> 01:11:18.327]  A national database to which the federal government and all states would have access.
[01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:22.570]  It's an integrated national database with federal standards to the states.
[01:11:23.011 --> 01:11:23.671]  That's correct.
[01:11:23.711 --> 01:11:24.332]  Let me just interrupt.
[01:11:24.352 --> 01:11:30.998]  So the reason I know so much about this is that, I'm not trying to brag, this is one of my specialties, just so you know, I'm not shooting my mouth off.
[01:11:31.698 --> 01:11:33.639]  Texas was openly the model state.
[01:11:33.739 --> 01:11:38.941]  Clinton signed an executive order for highway funds in 1993, right when he got into office.
[01:11:39.381 --> 01:11:42.603]  I protested it and was arrested in 97, made a film about it in 97.
[01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:45.044]  America destroyed by design.
[01:11:45.424 --> 01:11:53.848]  And in the executive orders and the plans, it says we're going to have a digital thumbprint, digital face scan photo, and a readable chip, and a script.
[01:11:53.888 --> 01:11:55.369]  They're going to have all these in there.
[01:11:55.649 --> 01:11:58.270]  Of course, the federal law says several of them.
[01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.071]  Which then has a key number that integrates to the database.
[01:12:01.091 --> 01:12:03.132]  So that's why I'm so aware of this.
[01:12:03.192 --> 01:12:08.034]  And I know a lot of that stuff I was bringing up sounds wild, but this has been a long time coming, sir.
[01:12:09.514 --> 01:12:13.295]  I have no doubt that a lot of people have been talking about these things, Alex.
[01:12:13.516 --> 01:12:21.518]  But I just wanted to make clear that the way things, such as you described, happen is not all at once, but incrementally.
[01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:25.460]  The first step is to create the framework, which is what RealID does.
[01:12:26.107 --> 01:12:36.073]  Beyond that, I think we will see not just the government, but also the private sector see the advantages of incorporating all sorts of information about you onto this chip.
[01:12:36.654 --> 01:12:46.320]  Credit card information, health information, banking information, which then will join the other driver's license type information in the data bank.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:49.582]  And frankly, Lord Acton had it right.
[01:12:50.402 --> 01:12:53.244]  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:12:53.795 --> 01:12:58.861]  And this is a potential source of what amounts to absolute informational power.
[01:12:59.101 --> 01:13:00.623]  And we're very concerned about it.
[01:13:01.384 --> 01:13:01.864]  Well, I agree.
[01:13:01.884 --> 01:13:08.071]  I want to talk about the strategy to get this passed and get it passed in other states, but you just mentioned a British statesman.
[01:13:09.773 --> 01:13:10.875]  At the same time, sir,
[01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:21.675]  We have England implementing a national ID card saying they're going to fund it by selling the data and private companies here are already selling the data back to the Fed.
[01:13:21.715 --> 01:13:28.738]  So it was in the New York Times what three years ago where it said every credit card purchase, everything you do, it's all going to go in the database.
[01:13:28.778 --> 01:13:29.579]  So that's admitted.
[01:13:29.619 --> 01:13:40.084]  I mean, TiVo when you watch your cable box is reporting your psychological algorithm, that's Chicago Tribune, in real time back to be sold to the data companies.
[01:13:41.564 --> 01:13:44.587]  These kinds of things are happening in the private sector as we speak.
[01:13:44.627 --> 01:13:46.028]  I think you're quite right about that.
[01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.051]  They see ways to use this information to make money.
[01:13:49.131 --> 01:13:59.600]  But at the moment, while the federal government is collecting some of this, our safety is preserved by the separation of a lot of these databases.
[01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:03.984]  The concern about RealID is that there will be a single database
[01:14:04.525 --> 01:14:23.009]  Which has a single number representing you, which will be the repository for both the private sector databases, additional government sector databases, and therefore information about yourself where you have had no control as to what is included in the central database.
[01:14:23.089 --> 01:14:26.930]  And by the way, they admit that around 2% of it will probably be wrong information.
[01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:29.231]  They call it the Grand Database.
[01:14:29.271 --> 01:14:31.692]  They have the Matrix System in Florida.
[01:14:31.752 --> 01:14:33.512]  They have the... Please continue.
[01:14:34.648 --> 01:14:38.469]  The database itself, of course, will be subject to abuse.
[01:14:38.529 --> 01:14:44.930]  It will be the kind of information that every marketer in the world will want to get into, and every ID thief will get into.
[01:14:45.491 --> 01:14:53.152]  And I put it to you that it will be hacked, that it will not provide us the security that we want for the reasons I've suggested.
[01:14:53.232 --> 01:14:59.354]  And by the way, the feds are already saying it's going to include your Google searches, your Yahoo searches, your internet history.
[01:14:59.614 --> 01:15:04.015]  That's already being sold between the companies, but now that has a potential to be in there.
[01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:17.436]  Uh, it certainly, the system would allow that to happen, but I certainly hope that you and I and other Americans would rise up in righteous indignation against the federal government which would contemplate that.
[01:15:17.736 --> 01:15:19.457]  Did you see the article two years ago?
[01:15:19.477 --> 01:15:20.358]  I'm sorry?
[01:15:20.758 --> 01:15:27.763]  Did you see the article two years ago in USA Today where it was something like scoff laws targeted by ordering pizzas?
[01:15:28.303 --> 01:15:43.789]  Front page USA Today where the big three pizza companies when you instantly order it goes into a federal database to scan if you have federal or state warrants and then they get twenty percent of fines or fees and so instead of a pizza you get a SWAT team?
[01:15:45.810 --> 01:15:51.572]  No I'm sorry I missed that but that sounds like the things that we could expect government to do when they have the technology
[01:15:52.034 --> 01:16:01.624]  And the ability to do that, which is one of the reasons why we don't want to give them the power to centralize all of this information and data through the real ID system.
[01:16:01.664 --> 01:16:07.791]  And it's why I think New Hampshire, if the Senate joins with the House, will lead the nation into a revolt against this.
[01:16:07.891 --> 01:16:13.517]  I expect and have been told that other states will follow once one state has the courage to lead the way.
[01:16:13.577 --> 01:16:14.158]  And I hope
[01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:17.763]  That that will be a live free or die state of New Hampshire.
[01:16:17.783 --> 01:16:22.606]  Now we gotta know, there are a bunch of lobbyists, the hardware sellers and the federal government, they're in your state right now.
[01:16:22.927 --> 01:16:33.254]  How do we help you, Representative Neil Kirk, make sure the Senate passes this as the House has done, and then finally, where does the Governor stand?
[01:16:34.434 --> 01:16:35.895]  The Governor will support the bill.
[01:16:35.955 --> 01:16:39.738]  If the Senate passes it and it goes on to his desk, the Governor has said he will sign it.
[01:16:40.807 --> 01:16:42.868]  So that isn't a particular issue.
[01:16:42.888 --> 01:16:44.730]  Do you have any obstructionists in the Senate?
[01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.291]  Yes.
[01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:57.277]  Some of our two state senators, excuse me, our two federal senators, Senator Gregg and Senator Sununu, are on opposite sides of this issue.
[01:16:58.158 --> 01:17:07.063]  So our state Senate is hearing two different versions of the story, and I think that they have not yet made up their minds as to what they're going to do.
[01:17:07.103 --> 01:17:08.944]  They're going to be voting tomorrow or the next day.
[01:17:09.981 --> 01:17:16.863]  And a lot of people in New Hampshire who are very concerned about this issue have been calling their state senators.
[01:17:16.903 --> 01:17:18.424]  There have been rallies in New Hampshire.
[01:17:18.904 --> 01:17:21.604]  There's been an extraordinary amount of publicity in the state.
[01:17:21.644 --> 01:17:23.385]  It's on the front pages of the newspapers.
[01:17:23.465 --> 01:17:24.225]  It's in the columns.
[01:17:24.285 --> 01:17:25.266]  It's in the editorials.
[01:17:25.826 --> 01:17:30.227]  Our conservative newspaper, the Union Leader, and our liberal newspaper, the Concord Monitor,
[01:17:30.768 --> 01:17:34.451]  Both of them have come out editorially against Real ID.
[01:17:35.012 --> 01:17:37.774]  It's across the spectrum here, and the Senators are aware of this.
[01:17:37.834 --> 01:17:40.196]  They know the people don't like this bill.
[01:17:40.977 --> 01:17:50.326]  And hopefully, Washington lobbying aside, our Senators will listen to their constituents and do the right thing and vote in favor of 1582.
[01:17:50.686 --> 01:17:53.929]  Well, Communist China last year put in a national ID card.
[01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.230]  We don't need to be like China.
[01:17:57.137 --> 01:18:00.339]  Or many of the other countries who have put in these national ID cards.
[01:18:00.379 --> 01:18:05.763]  Let me just give you one sad example from the past that should provide some historical guidance for us.
[01:18:06.344 --> 01:18:16.071]  In the early 1930s, the Dutch, in order to provide a better system of administering their particular variety of social benefits, put in a national identification card.
[01:18:16.511 --> 01:18:22.976]  And they included in that all sorts of information about a person, including name, race, religion, sex, and all of that.
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.922]  Six or seven years later, Nazi Germany took over... I'm sorry to interrupt you again.
[01:18:29.962 --> 01:18:30.943]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:18:30.983 --> 01:18:32.464]  I want you to be able to finish your story, okay?
[01:18:32.564 --> 01:18:32.864]  Sure.
[01:18:33.084 --> 01:18:42.929]  And then give out any websites or phone numbers so folks can basically lobby these politicians and others who are trying to block this right now.
[01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:48.171]  We're on the front lines of the Info War, defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[01:18:48.211 --> 01:18:49.552]  I want to thank our guest for joining us.
[01:18:49.832 --> 01:18:51.413]  Final segment with him coming up in your calls.
[01:18:53.897 --> 01:18:55.981]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:18:56.181 --> 01:18:58.405]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:18:58.726 --> 01:18:59.387]  New toenails?
[01:18:59.767 --> 01:19:00.769]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:19:01.751 --> 01:19:04.416]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:06.389]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:19:06.769 --> 01:19:09.190]  They were so discolored and really awful looking.
[01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:10.791]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:19:11.231 --> 01:19:12.911]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:14.432]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:19:14.472 --> 01:19:17.292]  Look, this one looks white and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:19:17.492 --> 01:19:18.753]  Well, here's my secret.
[01:19:19.313 --> 01:19:20.353]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:20.833 --> 01:19:24.894]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[01:19:25.614 --> 01:19:26.515]  Ah, so that's it.
[01:19:26.775 --> 01:19:29.315]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[01:19:29.596 --> 01:19:31.216]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[01:19:31.756 --> 01:19:34.818]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[01:19:35.178 --> 01:19:35.759]  You bet!
[01:19:35.959 --> 01:19:40.061]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are gonna look just as good as yours do.
[01:19:40.221 --> 01:19:41.762]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:42.122 --> 01:19:43.283]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:43.443 --> 01:19:45.124]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[01:19:45.484 --> 01:19:50.588]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[01:19:50.768 --> 01:19:51.888]  In the foot care section.
[01:19:59.073 --> 01:20:01.134]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:02.310]  One and the same.
[01:20:03.051 --> 01:20:07.052]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:07.072 --> 01:20:09.113]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:09.633]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:09.673 --> 01:20:11.173]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:11.453 --> 01:20:11.913]  Here is reality.
[01:20:11.933 --> 01:20:13.974]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:28.806 --> 01:20:32.488]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:36.791]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:20:37.211 --> 01:20:40.933]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:20:42.814 --> 01:20:43.054]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.692 --> 01:20:55.313]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:55.453 --> 01:20:59.554]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:59.675 --> 01:21:02.576]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:21:02.656 --> 01:21:09.379]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:21:09.539 --> 01:21:12.540]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.141]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:15.281 --> 01:21:19.983]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:21:20.163 --> 01:21:34.757]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:21:34.917 --> 01:21:41.583]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today, and order a 2-pack of Blunt Murky Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-8033.
[01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:57.416]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:57.537 --> 01:22:02.861]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:09.727]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[01:22:10.367 --> 01:22:13.210]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:25.041]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:45.096 --> 01:22:47.938]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:23:09.713 --> 01:23:13.136]  Nobody's going to track the illegal aliens, but you're going to be tracked.
[01:23:14.718 --> 01:23:15.718]  National ID card.
[01:23:15.738 --> 01:23:19.081]  Bush also passed the new Freedom Initiative, openly written by the drug companies.
[01:23:19.482 --> 01:23:30.912]  Their own internal documents got leaked a year before Bush even passed it, where they bragged that 15% of children were now on psychotropic drugs and that they would force half of our school children onto it with this new diagnosing system.
[01:23:31.493 --> 01:23:35.056]  That's right, the schools are mental institutions slash prisons now.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:41.602]  Going back to State Rep Neil M. Kirk, it's HB 1582 in the Live Free or Die State.
[01:23:41.943 --> 01:23:47.025]  Please continue, sir, with your story about a European experience with a national ID card.
[01:23:47.745 --> 01:23:57.509]  As I was saying, Alex, in Holland in the early part of the 30s, they set up a national ID card to help them better serve the people through their version of social programs.
[01:23:57.589 --> 01:24:00.070]  Well, when the Nazi Germans took over Holland,
[01:24:00.752 --> 01:24:13.821]  At the end of the 1930s, the first thing they did was to get hold of these national ID cards and use them to identify, locate, and kill the Jewish Dutch citizens.
[01:24:15.082 --> 01:24:24.149]  The point is that what could be used for a benign purpose, what could be used to help people, too often is misused.
[01:24:24.509 --> 01:24:28.632]  Not in the extreme example of the Nazis, but perhaps by our own government,
[01:24:29.301 --> 01:24:33.745]  Acting in what they think is our best interest, but not in fact in our best interest.
[01:24:33.765 --> 01:24:34.945]  But I go further than that.
[01:24:34.965 --> 01:24:36.387]  I mean, I go further than that.
[01:24:36.427 --> 01:24:40.370]  This government's openly saying it's above the law, engaging in all sorts of crime.
[01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:42.491]  I mean, there's no way I trust them with that.
[01:24:43.672 --> 01:24:49.897]  I share your concern about government in general, and that's why we in New Hampshire don't want to participate in the REAL ID Act.
[01:24:49.957 --> 01:24:53.299]  Why give those people who might harm you the tools to do it?
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:55.201]  It's not a smart thing to do.
[01:24:56.923 --> 01:25:04.988]  Other key points that you need to make, sir, and how do we help you get this passed in New Hampshire to be a bellwether and a domino effect across the country?
[01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:25.762]  I certainly think that contacting some of our state senators and other officials would be helpful, and I'd be pleased to give you a website to which some of your listeners might refer, but I would say at the end of the day, this is a battle that's fought within New Hampshire.
[01:25:26.218 --> 01:25:39.522]  I understand that the rest of the country is listening carefully to what we do, and hopefully, if we decide to opt out of Real ID, their state governments will also follow us, which would really undercut the Act.
[01:25:40.042 --> 01:25:48.725]  But ultimately, at this point, it's something that New Hampshire citizens have to talk about to their Senators, and the Senators in New Hampshire have to listen to their constituents.
[01:25:49.265 --> 01:25:55.227]  The website, for those who are interested, is GraniteStateID.com.
[01:25:55.868 --> 01:25:58.949]  GraniteStateID.com.
[01:25:59.549 --> 01:26:00.169]  No spaces.
[01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:15.213]  And if you go onto that website, you'll get all sorts of information about House Bill 1582, what can be done if you wanted to do something, and a little bit of history about what's going on in New Hampshire with respect to this effort.
[01:26:16.445 --> 01:26:22.546]  Do you, just in your gut, or looking at the field, do you see it going down in defeat?
[01:26:22.566 --> 01:26:26.007]  Do you see New Hampshire throwing out the National ID Card?
[01:26:27.427 --> 01:26:35.228]  I can't predict what the Senate will do tomorrow, but I can assure you that the opera isn't over until the fat lady sings.
[01:26:35.668 --> 01:26:44.270]  And even if the Senate turns it down tomorrow, and I'm not making a prediction, Alex, it's just a very divisive issue in the Senate.
[01:26:45.842 --> 01:26:54.708]  There are other ways that we can force this issue back to the table, and don't count us out if the Senate vote tomorrow doesn't go the right way.
[01:26:54.868 --> 01:27:02.993]  Well, there's also blocking the state from funding it, if you have to, or blocking the state from taking the federal money to fund it.
[01:27:03.013 --> 01:27:04.674]  I mean, there's many ways of skin a cat.
[01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:14.900]  There are, but if this bill does not pass, in New Hampshire at least, the impetus will be towards accepting the federal money and participating in the system.
[01:27:15.839 --> 01:27:16.279]  You're right.
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:22.590]  We will still, I certainly will make an effort to take other actions so that that doesn't happen.
[01:27:23.652 --> 01:27:26.677]  But it will not be a happy day in Concord, our state capital.
[01:27:27.327 --> 01:27:30.489]  Well, I really appreciate you, Neil Kirk, Representative.
[01:27:30.549 --> 01:27:32.289]  I wish we had more people like you in this country.
[01:27:32.329 --> 01:27:50.058]  It's shameful that a state like Texas, who thinks it's so free, the average Texan is just walking around, and I'm a Texan, I'm proud to be Texan, is walking around totally uninformed about what's going on, that our state is the most advanced in tracking and controlling of any of the 50, and I've looked at it closely, but hopefully we'll
[01:27:51.363 --> 01:27:56.585]  Follow your great example and start trying to do that here and other states where we have affiliates.
[01:27:57.645 --> 01:28:02.127]  I'd like to be able to talk to you again in the future, especially if you're able to pass this, and Godspeed.
[01:28:02.827 --> 01:28:03.668]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:28:03.988 --> 01:28:04.368]  Take care.
[01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:09.631]  Folks, we're going to come back and get into some other news and take some calls.
[01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:11.551]  In fact, I'm going to go right to your calls when we get back.
[01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:12.912]  Wide open phones right now.
[01:28:13.552 --> 01:28:17.833]  Any issue, any news story, any item I've raised, it's your chance to get involved.
[01:28:17.853 --> 01:28:22.615]  We'll take calls for the second half of the broadcast that starts in 30 seconds, basically.
[01:28:24.304 --> 01:28:25.585]  The point of no return here.
[01:28:26.305 --> 01:28:31.128]  The total free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:31.589 --> 01:28:33.810]  Talk about the illegal alien demonstrations yesterday.
[01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:34.851]  Talk about Iran.
[01:28:35.251 --> 01:28:36.212]  Talk about the economy.
[01:28:36.252 --> 01:28:38.093]  I've got some more comments on that I haven't gotten to.
[01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:39.013]  Some other news items.
[01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:40.114]  It's all coming up.
[01:28:44.217 --> 01:28:45.117]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.598 --> 01:28:47.179]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.199 --> 01:28:50.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.869 --> 01:29:00.254]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.575 --> 01:29:05.218]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency technology.
[01:29:05.579 --> 01:29:13.085]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequency.
[01:29:13.505 --> 01:29:20.348]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.568 --> 01:29:21.969]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:22.309 --> 01:29:25.951]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:26.211 --> 01:29:31.493]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions.
[01:29:31.753 --> 01:29:33.234]  And is very easy to use.
[01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:36.535]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:39.477]  Ask about our Spring Special now in progress.
[01:29:39.737 --> 01:29:43.039]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.099 --> 01:29:43.439]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:43.459 --> 01:29:44.339]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.832 --> 01:30:01.338]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.618 --> 01:30:14.607]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.887 --> 01:30:18.190]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:28.995]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:29.275 --> 01:30:29.775]  That's right!
[01:30:29.955 --> 01:30:37.079]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.359 --> 01:30:43.502]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[01:30:44.602 --> 01:30:46.103]  Calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:46.163 --> 01:30:46.823]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.898 --> 01:30:57.260]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.522]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:59.682 --> 01:31:06.729]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:06.989 --> 01:31:15.557]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:31:15.897 --> 01:31:20.583]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:31:20.723 --> 01:31:27.410]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:31.935]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:35.319 --> 01:31:38.863]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[01:31:39.043 --> 01:31:41.885]  Call today for a Calvin Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:42.046 --> 01:31:49.613]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalvinPureSoap.com.
[01:31:49.753 --> 01:31:52.976]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[01:31:54.758 --> 01:31:59.823]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.558 --> 01:32:02.919]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:03.739 --> 01:32:06.460]  You know, I love it whenever we talk about a particular state's issue.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.581]  It could be Hawaii.
[01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:11.522]  It could even be a protectorate or a possession like Puerto Rico.
[01:32:11.542 --> 01:32:13.303]  We get callers in on that issue.
[01:32:13.363 --> 01:32:16.924]  Just a testament to the type of listenership we have across the country.
[01:32:18.124 --> 01:32:19.885]  We have a smattering of AM and FM's.
[01:32:19.965 --> 01:32:20.185]  What?
[01:32:20.405 --> 01:32:23.426]  This show has affiliates in about 25 states.
[01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:28.648]  But we have global shortwave listeners and internet listeners and satellite listeners all over the world.
[01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:31.585]  But we can talk about any issue you wish.
[01:32:31.625 --> 01:32:35.907]  Again, the toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:36.368 --> 01:32:41.130]  Before we go, back to your calls, everybody needs to visit InfoWars.com.
[01:32:41.190 --> 01:32:42.251]  Short for Information War.
[01:32:42.591 --> 01:32:45.733]  I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S dot com.
[01:32:46.313 --> 01:32:50.855]  And you need to peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart at the video and bookstore.
[01:32:53.017 --> 01:32:59.340]  Number one, because these are powerful videos that I produced, and I carry the other best videos I've seen out there.
[01:32:59.853 --> 01:33:07.022]  Whether it's Loose Change 2nd Edition or just so many other films that we carry, you need to have them!
[01:33:08.317 --> 01:33:11.238]  There, of course, is also my classic 9-11 films.
[01:33:11.298 --> 01:33:13.479]  It's so important to expose government-sponsored terror.
[01:33:13.499 --> 01:33:15.280]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:16.901]  Masters of Terror.
[01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:19.822]  Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:33:20.122 --> 01:33:20.903]  My book on 9-11.
[01:33:20.923 --> 01:33:22.583]  9-11, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:33:22.603 --> 01:33:25.345]  Webster Tarpley's definitive work on the subject.
[01:33:25.365 --> 01:33:27.986]  9-11, Synthetic Terror, Made in the USA.
[01:33:28.026 --> 01:33:29.086]  George Humphrey's excellent.
[01:33:29.106 --> 01:33:30.947]  9-11, The Great Illusion.
[01:33:31.647 --> 01:33:32.828]  Endgame of the Illuminati.
[01:33:33.508 --> 01:33:35.049]  All of these are must-haves.
[01:33:35.089 --> 01:33:40.311]  Then I have Tex Marr's Codex Magicka, an encyclopedic book on the occult activities of the elite.
[01:33:40.591 --> 01:33:53.816]  My newest film, The Order of Death, that has new footage inside Bohemian Grove, inside the Idol, the ritualistic sacrifice, a human effigy that they do a ritualistic mock murder of,
[01:33:55.313 --> 01:34:04.919]  So much more, and when you get that video, you get free on the same DVD, the updated, re-edited, remastered, with new information added, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:08.621]  I've got a whole bunch of different specials.
[01:34:08.661 --> 01:34:12.664]  Again, there's 16 different specials on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:13.736 --> 01:34:33.401]  And when you order any videos, I mean if you order one video or one book, you get a free 69 page, color cover, citizen rule book with a Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, jury nullification, the power of the jury, the grand jury, famous quotes, powerful little booklet.
[01:34:33.781 --> 01:34:37.482]  And when you get a larger order, we put two or three of them in there,
[01:34:38.334 --> 01:34:39.895]  And we've got all these different specials.
[01:34:39.915 --> 01:34:45.278]  We have the Red, White, and Blue special, where you get Martial Law, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, and Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:34:45.758 --> 01:34:49.520]  And you just get a huge discount when you order that.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:53.962]  And we have all the savings listed for each special that is up there.
[01:34:54.863 --> 01:35:00.426]  We have the Reveal the New World Order special, the Order of Death and Dark Secrets combo, with Dylan Avery's Loose Change 2.
[01:35:00.906 --> 01:35:06.589]  We have the September 11th book special, Descent into Tyranny, Order Out of Chaos, George Humphrey's 9-11 The Great Illusion,
[01:35:07.395 --> 01:35:08.956]  For only $19.95.
[01:35:09.056 --> 01:35:10.037]  Three of those for $19.95.
[01:35:10.117 --> 01:35:13.039]  And we have the amazing t-shirt specials.
[01:35:13.099 --> 01:35:16.362]  Get one t-shirt and save $5.00.
[01:35:16.442 --> 01:35:18.944]  Get two t-shirts and save even more.
[01:35:19.284 --> 01:35:24.488]  Get t-shirts for as low as $5.95 apiece when you get three t-shirts.
[01:35:25.028 --> 01:35:28.791]  Again, the goal here is getting the information out.
[01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:34.501]  And you're authorized to make copies of any of the 14 films I've made.
[01:35:34.602 --> 01:35:38.031]  I can't authorize you to make copies of the other films we sell that other people produced.
[01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:45.524]  When you go to PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see all 14 of my films, over 100 of my weekly TV reports going back over two years.
[01:35:46.404 --> 01:35:50.368]  You can get dozens and dozens of weekly reports where I have a guest in studio each week.
[01:35:50.968 --> 01:35:57.273]  On average, some weeks I have two people in, some weeks I have nobody in, but on average it's a report every week inside the studio.
[01:35:57.333 --> 01:36:01.617]  Two cameras shoot, professionally done, with a lot of documents and key information added.
[01:36:02.437 --> 01:36:04.799]  You get all my best audio interviews posted up there.
[01:36:04.839 --> 01:36:07.580]  You can skip past all my babble, right to the interviews.
[01:36:07.921 --> 01:36:09.662]  You get my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:36:09.842 --> 01:36:11.203]  Normally an e-book is $5 to $6.
[01:36:11.463 --> 01:36:15.205]  You get a whole bunch of e-books, a bunch of other videos, all this stuff.
[01:36:15.445 --> 01:36:16.506]  It's a great activist tool.
[01:36:16.526 --> 01:36:18.727]  You can download them, burn copies, give them to people.
[01:36:19.047 --> 01:36:21.609]  PrisonPlanet.tv, $5.95 for a month.
[01:36:21.969 --> 01:36:24.951]  That's the price of less than three cups of Starbucks coffee a month.
[01:36:25.912 --> 01:36:29.075]  Or get a year membership and get three months free.
[01:36:29.436 --> 01:36:30.837]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:30.877 --> 01:36:35.862]  But whatever you do, go to InfoWars.com and get some of the hard copy of the videos and get them out today.
[01:36:36.182 --> 01:36:39.065]  The effect of you getting the films and making copies is massive.
[01:36:39.626 --> 01:36:40.747]  Or call toll free.
[01:36:42.088 --> 01:36:43.489]  They can answer all your questions.
[01:36:43.509 --> 01:36:43.569]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:49.953 --> 01:36:56.538]  That's 888-253-3139, or you can just write to me.
[01:36:56.618 --> 01:37:04.463]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:37:05.884 --> 01:37:06.764]  Please take action.
[01:37:07.645 --> 01:37:09.426]  Let's go ahead and talk to Shawna, New Hampshire.
[01:37:09.446 --> 01:37:15.150]  We were just talking about the great work of your fellow New Hampshireans that are there trying to defeat the National ID Card, sir.
[01:37:15.908 --> 01:37:29.299]  Yes, Alex, and I've been showing up at the protests, and we've been going around the towns in Portsmouth and Stratum waking people up to this atrocious police state law.
[01:37:29.979 --> 01:37:41.248]  And I'm an electrical engineer, and also a subscriber to PrisonPlanet.tv, and I use your films and videos to help wake people up to the New World Order.
[01:37:41.826 --> 01:37:43.807]  So, thank you very much for having that fight.
[01:37:44.047 --> 01:37:51.231]  Oh no, thank you for Karen, thank you for being a member, you make it all possible, but number one, thank you for waking other people up.
[01:37:52.112 --> 01:38:01.077]  Well, Alex, every man in his life has to stand up for something, and we have to stand against the New World Order.
[01:38:01.893 --> 01:38:03.415]  And what's going on in this country?
[01:38:03.495 --> 01:38:14.125]  Well, I think that state rep we had on was very informed, but see, he didn't even know about USA Today admitting that the major pizza companies track you and run it through a federal database when you order a pizza.
[01:38:14.566 --> 01:38:15.707]  You know, he giggled at that.
[01:38:15.747 --> 01:38:16.968]  He thought I was making that up.
[01:38:17.634 --> 01:38:20.116]  No, you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:38:20.676 --> 01:38:37.849]  I've worked as a software consultant inside some of these government agencies, and it is absolutely scary, and I know people who work inside these agencies and who have worked in them before, and it is absolutely scary the amount of information that they have on you.
[01:38:38.089 --> 01:38:39.510]  For instance, I'll give you an example.
[01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:43.873]  I worked for R. R. Donnelly and Sons, who owned a company called Metro Mail.
[01:38:44.691 --> 01:38:55.654]  Back in the early 90s, and they did a demonstration to the executives and some of the people there, and they said, oh well, what's your name, and just give me your name, and the state you live from.
[01:38:55.934 --> 01:39:01.936]  He told them how many kids he had, what grades they were in school, all kinds of information, and this was
[01:39:03.156 --> 01:39:06.677]  1990.
[01:39:03.276 --> 01:39:06.677]  And information technology is what, doubling every two years?
[01:39:07.257 --> 01:39:07.918]  Absolutely.
[01:39:08.178 --> 01:39:09.858]  It's doubling every two years.
[01:39:10.859 --> 01:39:18.741]  The number of disk drives, the number of data that can be stored on these disk drives, the government's investing in terabyte drives.
[01:39:20.062 --> 01:39:21.702]  It's an incredible amount of data.
[01:39:21.842 --> 01:39:26.264]  Well, the way the feds describe it in their own policy reports that are publicly linked to, folks.
[01:39:26.304 --> 01:39:28.745]  If we ever tried to read it all here on air, we wouldn't even have a show.
[01:39:28.785 --> 01:39:30.005]  We'd just be reading the whole time.
[01:39:31.154 --> 01:39:31.955]  This is how it works.
[01:39:32.075 --> 01:39:43.861]  Google has these little spiders and robots, that's what they're called, these programs that go out and scan all the text and keywords and it's basically older NSA technology, National Security Agency echelon type systems.
[01:39:44.001 --> 01:39:54.647]  Now with RFID and face scans and with your purchases being uploaded and all of this, the feds describe it and IT experts and information technology experts describe it
[01:39:55.789 --> 01:40:15.338]  As Google, not in cyberspace, but a Google type system in the real world where your family, your information, your viewing habits, your psychological algorithm, all of this is in real time in a government slash private database that's always being updated millisecond by millisecond.
[01:40:16.379 --> 01:40:18.620]  It literally is like Google for reality.
[01:40:19.449 --> 01:40:20.250]  Yes, it is.
[01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:28.436]  It's called fractal type searching of data mining techniques.
[01:40:29.717 --> 01:40:44.408]  It's the same sort of technology that allows you to go and do a fingerprint thumb scan and be able to, within a few seconds, identify the person from a database of millions of thumb scans or even billions.
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.762]  This technology is out there.
[01:40:47.882 --> 01:40:51.085]  It is absolutely incredible and state-of-the-art.
[01:40:51.486 --> 01:40:56.431]  Think of Star Trek when you were thinking of this technology, and this is what the feds have.
[01:40:56.932 --> 01:40:57.432]  Well, you're right.
[01:40:57.452 --> 01:40:59.354]  I mean, I remember seeing six years ago now
[01:41:00.459 --> 01:41:19.006]  In Indiana, AP report that the feds had put up hundreds of cameras hooked into software that, let's say there's a hundred cars in the camera's view coming down the interstate, it could instantly, without zooming into each one, instantly recognize all the plate numbers and instantly run those through a database.
[01:41:19.026 --> 01:41:20.767]  Then three years ago, remember the headline?
[01:41:21.127 --> 01:41:25.448]  Florida town runs the license of every car that drives through it.
[01:41:25.468 --> 01:41:26.549]  It was some headline like that.
[01:41:26.829 --> 01:41:29.230]  But that got big attention.
[01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:36.415]  And as you come into the town, as you leave, as you drive around, you're having your background run, everything's tracking you.
[01:41:36.735 --> 01:41:43.119]  Well now, I read articles, it's been put in Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, New York, Chicago, on the interstate highways.
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:45.041]  Now they're just wiring it all in.
[01:41:45.061 --> 01:41:46.141]  I mean, how is that freedom?
[01:41:46.362 --> 01:41:47.723]  But we can't control our borders.
[01:41:49.023 --> 01:41:49.864]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:41:50.324 --> 01:41:51.105]  And also too,
[01:41:51.690 --> 01:41:53.771]  People are saying, well, where are they getting this technology?
[01:41:53.851 --> 01:41:55.452]  Well, they're getting it from industry.
[01:41:55.512 --> 01:42:04.377]  I worked in print industry where you use vision systems to see if your magazines were aligned as they were going through the binder and stuff and reject bad ones.
[01:42:04.858 --> 01:42:07.359]  And it's called doing fast four-year transforms.
[01:42:07.939 --> 01:42:13.422]  And it's able to instantly, it recognizes things very much similarly the way the human brain does.
[01:42:14.163 --> 01:42:21.347]  And so it can go and look at a whole bunch of cars in the license place and instantly grab those numbers and then run them through a database.
[01:42:22.106 --> 01:42:25.832]  And people, it is very, very scary.
[01:42:26.775 --> 01:42:31.999]  The technology that they have, and the means by which they can implement their security.
[01:42:32.459 --> 01:42:45.729]  That started 30 years ago when the NSA would have satellite photos taken, or high altitude aircraft surveillance taken, and they didn't want to have thousands of humans having to, with big magnifying glasses, look at each picture.
[01:42:46.089 --> 01:42:51.633]  So they taught the computers how to look at certain key shapes and things, and then red flag those for analysis.
[01:42:51.933 --> 01:42:55.676]  Exactly, and that's how a system like Carnivore works.
[01:42:56.064 --> 01:43:13.958]  In fact, Barnes & Noble had a search engine that was implemented in a computer language called Smalltalk, which is what I write in, and you could type in the word, Boya Bayes, and it would recognize that you're talking about fish stew and give you a book with that type of recipe in it.
[01:43:14.578 --> 01:43:17.601]  So, the intelligence that they have in
[01:43:18.246 --> 01:43:19.307]  We're good to go.
[01:43:31.409 --> 01:43:45.116]  It even has a lexicon or a thesaurus of popularly used code words, which then also brings in the error rate, which they may even want on purpose as an excuse to widen their net and claim that intelligence is showing a higher threat level.
[01:43:45.356 --> 01:43:57.502]  By the way, talking to folks who've worked in NSA, and I can't get into much of it because I'm sworn to secrecy, a lot of it's classified, but really what NSA does, most of its operations is economic espionage.
[01:43:57.942 --> 01:43:59.784]  And most of that isn't against foreign countries.
[01:43:59.864 --> 01:44:03.766]  It's against Americans and other independent individuals and companies.
[01:44:04.107 --> 01:44:10.972]  That, whatever they steal, is then selectively given to globalist companies that are part of the Allied Crime Syndicate.
[01:44:11.192 --> 01:44:12.072]  It's not free market.
[01:44:12.773 --> 01:44:13.213]  That's right.
[01:44:13.694 --> 01:44:15.515]  You're absolutely correct in that.
[01:44:16.175 --> 01:44:26.483]  And what we have is a system of government where you have your tax dollars at hundreds of billions of dollars a year being used to
[01:44:27.133 --> 01:44:35.298]  Fund technology that benefits a few private corporations so that they can steal more of our dollars.
[01:44:35.879 --> 01:44:37.580]  And that's just the plain, simple truth.
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.403]  And your videos and stuff like that and your websites explain that in great detail.
[01:44:43.704 --> 01:44:44.985]  Well, I try the best I can.
[01:44:45.125 --> 01:44:54.331]  Listen, it was really wonderful talking to you, Sean, and I want to commend you guys for being very close to defeating the National ID Card via the REAL ID Act there in New Hampshire.
[01:44:54.881 --> 01:45:03.445]  We are going to do everything we can to get this to pass, and so that New Hampshire is the lead state, so that we can take the first step forward.
[01:45:03.545 --> 01:45:14.050]  And I've got to commend Vermont on putting together papers of impeachment for the President, because if we do not stop this tyranny, it's going to roll over us.
[01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:15.691]  I hear you, Sean.
[01:45:15.711 --> 01:45:16.051]  Thank you.
[01:45:16.071 --> 01:45:20.173]  We're going to talk to Brett McClellan and others here in a few minutes, but first off, how long is this clip?
[01:45:20.193 --> 01:45:22.954]  Do I have time to roll it in the five minutes for the break?
[01:45:23.965 --> 01:45:30.587]  Yeah, okay, this is a little piece of a few years ago, and we're going to repost it on Infowars.com.
[01:45:31.687 --> 01:45:35.068]  When you go there, you're the technician at the pizza place.
[01:45:35.688 --> 01:45:42.350]  And this was done after the report came out in USA Today about how when you order a pizza, you're running through a database.
[01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:47.071]  And it admitted that the big three pizza companies in America are doing this.
[01:45:47.791 --> 01:45:50.492]  Okay, no judge, no jury, no Fourth Amendment, no Fifth Amendment.
[01:45:50.872 --> 01:45:51.772]  This is just happening.
[01:45:52.282 --> 01:46:01.730]  And so they put it together with the view of you're the technician looking at a computer screen clicking on these data files as you talk to the individual just off of their phone number.
[01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:03.331]  So let's go ahead and roll this.
[01:46:03.391 --> 01:46:04.873]  This is not even satire, folks.
[01:46:04.893 --> 01:46:05.233]  Here it is.
[01:46:05.874 --> 01:46:09.196]  Pizza Palace.
[01:46:09.236 --> 01:46:10.718]  Guaranteed hot in 30 minutes, so it's free.
[01:46:10.738 --> 01:46:11.278]  This is Mary.
[01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:12.019]  May I take your order?
[01:46:12.259 --> 01:46:13.280]  Hi, uh, Mary.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:14.801]  Yes, I'd like to order.
[01:46:15.181 --> 01:46:15.742]  This is Mr. Kelly.
[01:46:16.437 --> 01:46:16.797]  Uh, yes?
[01:46:17.158 --> 01:46:18.239]  Thank you for calling again, sir.
[01:46:18.599 --> 01:46:24.003]  I see your national identification number is 6102049998-45-54610, is that correct?
[01:46:24.083 --> 01:46:26.045]  Uh, yes.
[01:46:26.525 --> 01:46:27.286]  Thank you, Mr. Kelly.
[01:46:27.586 --> 01:46:30.749]  I see you live at 736 Montrose Court, but you're calling from your cell phone.
[01:46:30.789 --> 01:46:31.289]  Are you at home?
[01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:34.432]  I'm just leaving work, but I'm- Oh, we can deliver to Bob's Auto Supply.
[01:46:34.632 --> 01:46:36.353]  That's at 175 Lincoln Avenue, yes?
[01:46:36.453 --> 01:46:38.015]  No, I'm on my way home.
[01:46:38.715 --> 01:46:39.836]  How do you know all this stuff?
[01:46:40.056 --> 01:46:41.678]  We just got wired into the system, sir.
[01:46:42.058 --> 01:46:42.158]  Oh.
[01:46:42.678 --> 01:46:45.761]  Well, I'd like to order a couple of your double meat special pizzas.
[01:46:46.161 --> 01:46:46.582]  Sure thing.
[01:46:46.903 --> 01:46:48.587]  There'll be a new $20 charge for those, sir.
[01:46:49.048 --> 01:46:49.510]  What do you mean?
[01:46:50.325 --> 01:46:54.628]  Sir, the system shows me that your medical records indicate that you have high blood pressure and extremely high cholesterol.
[01:46:55.009 --> 01:47:01.414]  Luckily, we have a new agreement with your national health care provider that allows us to sell you double meat pies as long as you agree to waive all future plans of liability.
[01:47:01.594 --> 01:47:01.854]  What?
[01:47:01.874 --> 01:47:02.635]  Do you agree, sir?
[01:47:02.915 --> 01:47:05.537]  You can sign the form when we deliver, but there is a charge for processing.
[01:47:05.557 --> 01:47:07.959]  The total is $67 even.
[01:47:08.439 --> 01:47:07.959]  $67?
[01:47:08.759 --> 01:47:13.563]  That includes the delivery surcharge of $15 to cover the added risk to our driver of traveling through an orange zone.
[01:47:14.103 --> 01:47:15.384]  I live in an orange zone?
[01:47:15.464 --> 01:47:16.025]  Now you do.
[01:47:16.425 --> 01:47:18.587]  Looks like there was another robbery on Montrose yesterday.
[01:47:18.607 --> 01:47:18.667]  Hmm.
[01:47:20.495 --> 01:47:24.518]  You could save $48 if you ordered our special Sprout Submarine Combo and picked it up yourself.
[01:47:24.959 --> 01:47:26.019]  Comes with tofu sticks.
[01:47:26.059 --> 01:47:27.461]  Those are very tasty, sir.
[01:47:27.521 --> 01:47:28.361]  Good value, too.
[01:47:28.381 --> 01:47:29.582]  But I want double meat.
[01:47:30.463 --> 01:47:32.645]  Well, I'm sure you can afford the $67, then.
[01:47:32.985 --> 01:47:34.546]  You just bought those tickets to Hawaii.
[01:47:34.606 --> 01:47:35.487]  They weren't cheap, eh?
[01:47:36.568 --> 01:47:36.828]  Oh.
[01:47:37.288 --> 01:47:40.611]  But I see you checked out the budget beach bum at the library last week.
[01:47:41.271 --> 01:47:41.852]  Hmm.
[01:47:42.352 --> 01:47:43.073]  Up to you, sir.
[01:47:43.153 --> 01:47:44.054]  Alright, alright.
[01:47:44.074 --> 01:47:46.275]  I'll get the Sprout Subs.
[01:47:46.556 --> 01:47:47.236]  Good choice, sir.
[01:47:47.756 --> 01:47:49.518]  Gotta watch that waste if you're hitting the beach, eh?
[01:47:50.915 --> 01:47:51.316]  42 inches!
[01:47:51.916 --> 01:47:52.317]  Wow.
[01:47:53.117 --> 01:47:55.960]  Man, I'd say tofu and sprouts is, like, required.
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:56.800]  That's how much?
[01:47:57.201 --> 01:48:01.224]  Just between you and me, there's a $3 off coupon in this month's Total Men's Fitness Magazine.
[01:48:01.505 --> 01:48:03.006]  Your wife Betty subscribes to that, right?
[01:48:03.646 --> 01:48:05.888]  Anyhow, clip that and it's $19.99 even.
[01:48:06.429 --> 01:48:08.891]  Whoa, looks like you maxed out on all your credit cards.
[01:48:09.211 --> 01:48:09.992]  Bring cash, okay?
[01:48:10.012 --> 01:48:12.354]  I want to stop this from happening.
[01:48:15.598 --> 01:48:37.384]  Now, the Feds have openly announced, the Department of Agriculture of all people, and then Health and Human Services a year later, I guess it was four years ago this started, that under the new national ID card, sales tax that Neil Bortz promotes every single day, because he's so conservative, when you swipe your card, you're going to start getting CPS visits if you're eating too much ice cream or buying too much beer.
[01:48:37.404 --> 01:48:41.425]  Remember the guy who admitted he drank a six-pack every night to his doctor, but drank at home?
[01:48:43.531 --> 01:48:46.353]  He was having heart palpitations, and so they went ahead and revoked his license.
[01:48:46.393 --> 01:48:47.934]  No judge, no jury, no arrest.
[01:48:48.675 --> 01:48:49.776]  They just revoked his license.
[01:48:49.796 --> 01:48:50.717]  Remember that a few years ago?
[01:48:50.737 --> 01:48:50.977]  Remember?
[01:48:50.997 --> 01:48:51.217]  Remember?
[01:48:52.718 --> 01:48:55.220]  They are going to tax you and make you pay more.
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:49:03.306]  There'll be certain amounts of red meat you can buy, certain amounts of sugar, and then after that, it's going to cost more and go into a new national fund for health care.
[01:49:04.967 --> 01:49:07.949]  Now, a lot of you have been listening for ten years, or longer.
[01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:09.250]  You know I'm not kidding.
[01:49:09.450 --> 01:49:10.591]  Listen, that's not a joke.
[01:49:12.023 --> 01:49:13.664]  Okay, I'm serious.
[01:49:14.865 --> 01:49:16.947]  Okay, that wasn't satire you were just hearing.
[01:49:16.967 --> 01:49:20.069]  That's the level of control the government has.
[01:49:20.169 --> 01:49:25.113]  And the major pizza chains are uploading and running your background.
[01:49:25.153 --> 01:49:29.757]  See, because fugitives and wanted individuals will, the government won't know their address.
[01:49:29.777 --> 01:49:33.540]  But when someone calls them with their name and credit card and info, they will give a real address.
[01:49:34.930 --> 01:49:37.112]  And some of you will say, what do you got to hide?
[01:49:37.152 --> 01:49:38.133]  You're the rescue!
[01:49:38.513 --> 01:49:40.415]  The point is, we're all being surveilled.
[01:49:40.435 --> 01:49:44.679]  Remember, I told you that all the major phone companies have NSA offices in them?
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.843]  That was public in 96, now it's in the news and everybody's freaking out!
[01:49:54.986 --> 01:49:57.829]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.089 --> 01:49:59.671]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:04.696]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.036 --> 01:50:11.783]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.103 --> 01:50:14.084]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.285 --> 01:50:17.126]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.227 --> 01:50:21.870]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:26.493]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.733 --> 01:50:33.958]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.198 --> 01:50:36.639]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:54.002 --> 01:50:55.983]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:50:56.063 --> 01:51:06.767]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:07.147 --> 01:51:11.669]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:11.749 --> 01:51:23.073]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.673 --> 01:51:30.519]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:30.919 --> 01:51:33.041]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:33.541 --> 01:51:38.505]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[01:51:38.825 --> 01:51:44.890]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at
[01:51:45.811 --> 01:51:45.891]  803-4438.

[01:51:49.592 --> 01:51:52.433]  That's toll free.
[01:51:52.453 --> 01:51:53.173]  888-803-4438.

[01:52:40.675 --> 01:52:43.777]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.937 --> 01:52:49.841]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:49.861 --> 01:52:55.424]  So it's simple.
[01:52:55.464 --> 01:53:02.048]  The criminal globalists are going to carry out bombings, stage riots,
[01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:10.150]  Release bird flu, smallpox, whatever they need.
[01:53:10.210 --> 01:53:11.371]  Get us all herded into cities.
[01:53:11.831 --> 01:53:13.051]  Track and trace everything we do.
[01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:14.812]  Force drug the entire population.
[01:53:15.092 --> 01:53:16.093]  Take your pension funds.
[01:53:16.133 --> 01:53:16.933]  Totally enslave you.
[01:53:17.853 --> 01:53:18.414]  I'm not kidding.
[01:53:18.494 --> 01:53:19.434]  That's their official plan.
[01:53:20.935 --> 01:53:23.556]  And I'm sorry the real world's scary, but look at history.
[01:53:23.676 --> 01:53:26.157]  Tyranny and abuse and despotism is the norm.
[01:53:26.537 --> 01:53:27.818]  Freedom is almost unknown.
[01:53:29.233 --> 01:53:30.995]  And America's always bigger and better.
[01:53:31.035 --> 01:53:32.676]  We're always bigger and better in Texas, too.
[01:53:32.756 --> 01:53:35.118]  So, we're really on the forefront here in Texas.
[01:53:35.158 --> 01:53:38.000]  I've been sitting here watching it in horror since college.
[01:53:38.741 --> 01:53:39.801]  Brett in Oklahoma.
[01:53:39.841 --> 01:53:40.842]  Thank you for holding, Brett.
[01:53:41.543 --> 01:53:42.524]  Yes, Alex.
[01:53:42.584 --> 01:53:45.046]  I've got a little workaround for your pizza.
[01:53:45.606 --> 01:53:52.711]  If you go in and see them in the store and order Pizza Direct, they'll ask only for your first name.
[01:53:52.832 --> 01:53:54.533]  If you pay for it cash, right up front.
[01:53:55.396 --> 01:53:56.456]  No track, no trace.
[01:53:56.956 --> 01:54:04.399]  Well see, that's why with the National ID card, your driver's license, they're going to swipe it just to decide what sales tax bracket you're in.
[01:54:05.079 --> 01:54:13.441]  Well I know, I just took my daughter to get a new ID card the other day and they took her fingerprint, her thumbprint, and you know, eye zap, you know.
[01:54:13.702 --> 01:54:15.442]  And see, you're in Oklahoma, it's already there.
[01:54:15.842 --> 01:54:16.422]  Oh yes sir.
[01:54:17.943 --> 01:54:19.263]  I have it and don't like it.
[01:54:20.544 --> 01:54:24.605]  Did you ever use my footage I sent you on the Goldsby gassing there?
[01:54:25.638 --> 01:54:27.919]  They were spraying down south of Norman there.
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:31.101]  Sir, I was looking for that video.
[01:54:31.181 --> 01:54:32.021]  How was it labeled?
[01:54:32.041 --> 01:54:32.781]  When did you send it?
[01:54:33.642 --> 01:54:35.743]  Oh, it was back when it first happened.
[01:54:35.763 --> 01:54:37.023]  A year and a half ago?
[01:54:37.063 --> 01:54:37.644]  Yeah.
[01:54:38.064 --> 01:54:46.808]  We actually, right now, have a guy in there sitting on the floor with huge boxes of VHS tapes, digging through them, logging them, and watching them.
[01:54:47.488 --> 01:54:48.789]  You ought to see the stuff I'm finding.
[01:54:48.809 --> 01:54:49.829]  And you probably get a lot.
[01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:52.651]  Well, I've just gotten
[01:54:54.045 --> 01:54:56.367]  We now have probably 500 tapes, no exaggeration.
[01:54:56.967 --> 01:54:59.289]  But we are going through them, so people keep sending stuff.
[01:55:00.189 --> 01:55:00.850]  Absolutely.
[01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:03.011]  We try to go through it when it comes in.
[01:55:03.031 --> 01:55:04.592]  I just, it's insane around here.
[01:55:04.973 --> 01:55:05.853]  All we do is work.
[01:55:07.194 --> 01:55:09.836]  I encourage everybody to plant a little victory garden, too.
[01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:14.159]  If things get tight, you know, you got some food that's there.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:21.725]  Well, instead of buying your kids some junky GI Joe $200 toy set, plant a garden.
[01:55:22.065 --> 01:55:23.646]  Children instinctively love it.
[01:55:24.548 --> 01:55:25.069]  Absolutely.
[01:55:25.969 --> 01:55:28.091]  But again, the Gardens are very Al Qaeda-ish.
[01:55:28.231 --> 01:55:30.754]  They're trying to restrict them in areas of Oregon.
[01:55:31.034 --> 01:55:31.534]  Cities are.
[01:55:32.735 --> 01:55:35.258]  We're kind of, you know, out here in the territories in Oklahoma.
[01:55:36.639 --> 01:55:37.680]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:38.561]  Criminals, all of us.
[01:55:39.301 --> 01:55:49.290]  Oh, I was just wondering if we should go out and all by, you know, as a form of protest by large numbers of Levi's or something, or communications equipment, or
[01:55:51.877 --> 01:55:54.418]  Consumable goods, you know, that would label us as terrorists.
[01:55:54.858 --> 01:56:05.521]  Oh yeah, the Texas manual says those that wear Levi's, those that have cell phones, those that have children, those that are nice to police, friendly to police is the exact quote, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:56:05.561 --> 01:56:12.604]  Constitution, those that have road almanacs, those that are, I believe, in the Second Amendment, land rights activists, or property rights activists, excuse me.
[01:56:13.064 --> 01:56:16.885]  Yeah, and if you have social security cards or a driver's license, either originals or copies,
[01:56:17.412 --> 01:56:19.473]  It's in the Unusual Discoveries list.
[01:56:19.593 --> 01:56:20.613]  It's just crazy.
[01:56:20.813 --> 01:56:26.715]  Well, it's designed to make everyone a terrorist, sir, because the government are the real terrorists, so the terrorists want us to be the terrorists.
[01:56:26.975 --> 01:56:28.116]  They want us to be the bad guys.
[01:56:28.436 --> 01:56:36.199]  In a tyranny, there are laws that everyone breaks, there are regulations that everyone breaks, so if they want to selectively enforce, they can.
[01:56:36.219 --> 01:56:42.181]  Well, I think a lot of our police are waking up, and the Barney Fife's that get caught behind the lines, I don't know.
[01:56:43.359 --> 01:56:44.680]  They probably won't be treated well.
[01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.660]  Look at New Orleans.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.761]  The cops threw FEMA out of three parishes.
[01:56:47.981 --> 01:56:53.284]  They refused to let FEMA sabotage equipment and they tried to stand up against gun confiscation.
[01:56:54.345 --> 01:56:54.905]  Absolutely.
[01:56:54.965 --> 01:56:56.846]  I definitely back them there.
[01:56:56.886 --> 01:56:59.508]  They take mine out of my cold dead of hands there.
[01:57:00.308 --> 01:57:00.828]  God bless you.
[01:57:00.848 --> 01:57:01.609]  Good to hear from you.
[01:57:01.629 --> 01:57:02.809]  We'll start the third hour.
[01:57:02.829 --> 01:57:03.770]  We're going to get into Iran.
[01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:04.670]  Big developments there.
[01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:06.651]  More on the illegal aliens getting violent.
[01:57:06.691 --> 01:57:07.852]  The media trying to cover that up.
[01:57:08.556 --> 01:57:09.657]  I want to get into the economy.
[01:57:09.717 --> 01:57:10.818]  Some of the indicators there.
[01:57:10.919 --> 01:57:12.040]  Very important information.
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:13.561]  Totally jam-packed third hour.
[01:57:13.601 --> 01:57:14.963]  But first, we'll continue with your phone calls.
[01:57:14.983 --> 01:57:15.363]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:15.383 --> 01:57:17.065]  1-800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[01:57:17.145 --> 01:57:19.107]  Listen, the globalists are trying to implement right now.
[01:57:19.127 --> 01:57:20.489]  That means people are waking up.
[01:57:20.849 --> 01:57:21.289]  Fertile ground.
[01:57:33.502 --> 01:57:38.345]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.385 --> 01:57:38.845]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.865 --> 01:57:39.766]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:41.887]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:41.947 --> 01:57:42.607]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.414 --> 01:57:57.315]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.335 --> 01:58:01.959]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.159 --> 01:58:06.283]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.263 --> 01:58:09.986]  Defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[01:58:10.066 --> 01:58:11.607]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:12.108 --> 01:58:13.188]  Now to the third hour.
[01:58:13.208 --> 01:58:22.937]  I want to get into rock and bottle throwing incidents reported in Santa Ana and other areas of the country by the precious invading hordes that say this is Mexico.
[01:58:24.153 --> 01:58:27.234]  Get into Iran, we're really starting to rattle the sabers.
[01:58:27.794 --> 01:58:30.935]  Some info on the economy, but right now let's go to Russell in Florida.
[01:58:30.975 --> 01:58:31.976]  Tom, Scott and others.
[01:58:32.276 --> 01:58:33.656]  Go ahead Russell, you're on the air.
[01:58:33.716 --> 01:58:37.158]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call and I really appreciate everything you're doing, sir.
[01:58:37.178 --> 01:58:37.738]  Appreciate you!
[01:58:38.038 --> 01:58:38.458]  Thank you.
[01:58:40.039 --> 01:58:46.961]  You probably are aware of this AP article that came out today, entitled Government Draft Pandemic Flu Plan.
[01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:59.933]  There's a quote in there that says the report envisions possible breakdowns in public order and says governors might deploy National Guard troops or request federal troops to maintain order.
[01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:05.855]  The military also could be activated to enforce travel restrictions and deliver vaccines and medicines the report says.
[01:59:06.315 --> 01:59:15.358]  This is just like your Urban Warrior drills that you were at and it sounds like they're really cramping down and planning
[01:59:15.976 --> 01:59:16.836]  This thing to happen.
[01:59:17.176 --> 01:59:21.718]  And you can guarantee that when it does, the food and water isn't coming.
[01:59:22.238 --> 01:59:26.139]  They're sending SWAT teams to take your guns and make a few examples of people.
[01:59:27.179 --> 01:59:27.780]  It's sick.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:28.920]  Yeah, it is.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:35.462]  I mean, do you think that this whole bird flu thing is going to be a cover for a false flag bio attack?
[01:59:36.182 --> 01:59:38.043]  I'm not saying it's going to happen with bird flu.
[01:59:38.103 --> 01:59:38.503]  It could.
[01:59:39.489 --> 01:59:40.430]  But I know this.
[01:59:40.530 --> 01:59:41.751]  They're going to do something.
[01:59:41.772 --> 01:59:44.975]  They've been preparing for decades, quietly laying the groundwork.
[01:59:45.395 --> 01:59:53.564]  And now, as soon as their infrastructure's in, and as soon as they think the public will buy into their scenario and go along with it, they'll implement.
[01:59:53.584 --> 02:00:00.491]  They were clearly, three years ago, almost four, getting ready for a smallpox attack.
[02:00:00.591 --> 02:00:02.633]  Remember they were saying it's going to happen.
[02:00:03.467 --> 02:00:04.948]  We're going to have martial law.
[02:00:04.988 --> 02:00:06.330]  We're going to have crematoriums.
[02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:08.031]  There are going to be dump trucks of dead.
[02:00:08.391 --> 02:00:09.933]  It will happen.
[02:00:09.953 --> 02:00:10.874]  Those were the headlines.
[02:00:11.814 --> 02:00:18.861]  And I said on air, I said, if the state police and the cops and the firefighters and the medical workers, the 14 million people,
[02:00:20.269 --> 02:00:26.973]  If the emergency responders refuse to take it, they will not implement because that's a sign that they won't force it.
[02:00:27.353 --> 02:00:28.754]  But again, it's not even a shot.
[02:00:28.974 --> 02:00:30.354]  I don't even think that's the big deal.
[02:00:30.394 --> 02:00:31.555]  And of course, you've got to say no to that, too.
[02:00:31.575 --> 02:00:32.335]  There's major problems.
[02:00:32.776 --> 02:00:34.717]  It's the smoke screen of the hysteria.
[02:00:35.017 --> 02:00:36.598]  It's the smoke screen for the takeover.
[02:00:36.618 --> 02:00:46.102]  I mean, why have I videotaped Marines from Maryland to Oakland, California, from North Carolina to South Texas training to take our guns and put us in camps and saying it's for America?
[02:00:47.143 --> 02:00:48.984]  They've been preparing this for a long time.
[02:00:49.665 --> 02:00:55.608]  And as soon as they think they can get away with it, the minute they think they can get away with it, they will launch it.
[02:00:56.489 --> 02:00:56.929]  I agree.
[02:00:57.009 --> 02:01:11.938]  And also, once the hysteria sets in, you'll have a lot of these people that you think know what's going on, or are on our side, turning tail and accepting an ID card, or accepting food rations, or accepting the police, declaring martial law.
[02:01:11.998 --> 02:01:14.840]  And then we'll see a lot of people we didn't think were on our side fighting.
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:15.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:16.120]  You're right.
[02:01:16.921 --> 02:01:17.281]  You're right.
[02:01:17.847 --> 02:01:45.855]  But, you know, that one article that was on Prison Planet yesterday where they were talking about this movie that's coming out in a few weeks regarding bird flu and that the authorities were rolling out barbed wire, chicken... Dump trucks, massive funeral pyres... It sounds like they're setting up a major PSYOP to condition us, as you said, to condition us for this control grid, totalitarian police state, and
[02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:51.634]  I think something's going to happen here in the next, if not this year, in the next few years.
[02:01:51.714 --> 02:01:55.898]  Why do you think Bush, every day, is declaring he's above the law on a host of issues?
[02:01:55.918 --> 02:01:57.199]  They're setting that precedent.
[02:01:57.479 --> 02:02:04.486]  Why do you think Tommy Franks, who we later learned was on the federal payroll illegally, was out, after he retired, PRing for martial law?
[02:02:05.426 --> 02:02:07.128]  Because they're all part of a connected network.
[02:02:07.228 --> 02:02:08.629]  These are sick crooks!
[02:02:08.909 --> 02:02:10.471]  They're going to kill the country!
[02:02:11.337 --> 02:02:15.641]  And you're going to have all these sicko neocons who live by a different set of rules.
[02:02:15.681 --> 02:02:19.724]  Your kid gets caught, or you get caught gobbling Oxycontin, and you're going to prison.
[02:02:20.025 --> 02:02:21.186]  You're allowed to gobble it.
[02:02:22.367 --> 02:02:23.568]  Yeah, they're always above the law.
[02:02:25.249 --> 02:02:26.810]  They are the law, boy!
[02:02:27.691 --> 02:02:28.632]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:29.633 --> 02:02:31.635]  More calls coming up after this quick break.
[02:02:31.655 --> 02:02:31.715]  1-800-259-9231.

[02:02:45.638 --> 02:02:49.961]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.161 --> 02:02:54.503]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:56.493 --> 02:02:59.115]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.155 --> 02:03:01.956]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:03:02.277 --> 02:03:06.499]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.559 --> 02:03:13.484]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.624 --> 02:03:15.625]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.885 --> 02:03:26.369]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.609 --> 02:03:32.011]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.

[02:03:46.832 --> 02:03:47.874]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.194 --> 02:03:50.978]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.258 --> 02:03:55.403]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.844 --> 02:03:56.665]  So what do you do?
[02:03:56.986 --> 02:04:01.552]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.032 --> 02:04:04.153]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.653 --> 02:04:05.553]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:04:05.953 --> 02:04:19.338]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:04:45.336 --> 02:04:52.202]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:04:52.362 --> 02:05:05.293]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:05:05.473 --> 02:05:07.255]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:05:07.435 --> 02:05:10.897]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:05:11.157 --> 02:05:14.959]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:05:15.199 --> 02:05:20.181]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:05:20.441 --> 02:05:22.162]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:05:22.422 --> 02:05:26.384]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:05:26.644 --> 02:05:28.485]  Dango is what you are looking for!

[02:05:46.637 --> 02:05:48.719]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:52.142]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.302 --> 02:05:57.868]  Alright, Tom, Scott, Chris, Fred, many others.
[02:05:58.168 --> 02:05:59.669]  Wide open phones in this third hour.
[02:05:59.709 --> 02:06:01.371]  We got 52 minutes left.
[02:06:01.391 --> 02:06:01.611]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:01.631 --> 02:06:07.016]  I've covered a lot of news so far today, but there's a bunch of it on the borders.
[02:06:07.216 --> 02:06:08.658]  The illegal aliens getting violent.
[02:06:09.358 --> 02:06:12.181]  National media covering it up, but it is in local media around the country.
[02:06:13.678 --> 02:06:15.179]  I want to get into some economic news as well.
[02:06:15.219 --> 02:06:16.601]  I will cover those issues.
[02:06:17.021 --> 02:06:21.485]  We will get to your calls, but I haven't played this in a long time.
[02:06:22.126 --> 02:06:26.449]  It's pretty funny, but it's also serious with the Neocon Star.
[02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:27.911]  Remember OnStar?
[02:06:27.951 --> 02:06:37.879]  I reported about two years before it was mainstream news, because I've seen it in some federal documents, that the FBI was using OnStar, which you can hardly not buy a new car now that doesn't have it on it.
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:39.721]  And you have to have it disabled.
[02:06:41.192 --> 02:06:42.253]  Where they were using it.
[02:06:42.293 --> 02:06:44.035]  It's a cell phone in your car with audio.
[02:06:44.075 --> 02:06:45.717]  They were using it to listen to people.
[02:06:46.098 --> 02:06:49.121]  And you just have the NSA dial in and it listens for keywords.
[02:06:50.503 --> 02:06:51.424]  Total surveillance.
[02:06:52.205 --> 02:06:54.948]  So it's a classic little piece.
[02:06:54.988 --> 02:06:55.969]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[02:07:01.038 --> 02:07:01.819]  We're good to go.
[02:07:40.707 --> 02:07:41.868]  But I can't find it.
[02:07:41.928 --> 02:07:42.989]  I'm looking everywhere.
[02:07:43.049 --> 02:07:45.170]  I can't find my national ID card.
[02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:45.551]  Okay.
[02:07:59.804 --> 02:08:01.885]  I'll take the lethal injection, please.
[02:08:02.125 --> 02:08:04.406]  Thanks for using Neocon Star.
[02:08:04.746 --> 02:08:05.546]  Have a nice day.
[02:08:06.207 --> 02:08:10.328]  Yeah, you've got to love all those ridiculous OnStar commercials.
[02:08:10.368 --> 02:08:11.589]  Help me, I'm locked.
[02:08:11.769 --> 02:08:12.289]  Save me.
[02:08:12.309 --> 02:08:14.270]  Unlock my car for me.
[02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:15.230]  Will you?
[02:08:15.250 --> 02:08:17.251]  I use the potty, will you?
[02:08:17.271 --> 02:08:18.552]  I'm not going to say that.
[02:08:20.593 --> 02:08:23.094]  It's like they're babies, you know, they have to have their diapers changed.
[02:08:23.994 --> 02:08:25.274]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:08:25.635 --> 02:08:28.816]  Your calls and news are coming up, but we are always honored to be joined
[02:08:29.742 --> 02:08:31.243]  By Debbie Maher of Numulium Concepts.
[02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:32.004]  Let me just say this.
[02:08:32.564 --> 02:08:33.465]  Cutting through all the hype.
[02:08:34.445 --> 02:08:39.729]  I don't sell magical super cures like some of the quack snake oil people do.
[02:08:39.769 --> 02:08:40.830]  It's quite embarrassing.
[02:08:41.890 --> 02:08:44.812]  I don't sell miracle machines that heal you.
[02:08:46.013 --> 02:08:51.337]  I don't sell, you know, I mean, I'm a somewhat honorable person.
[02:08:53.038 --> 02:08:54.799]  I sell high quality books and videos.
[02:08:54.879 --> 02:08:56.160]  I promote organic soap.
[02:08:57.475 --> 02:09:00.376]  That saves you a lot of money and is good for your skin.
[02:09:01.076 --> 02:09:02.676]  Won't make you live forever or anything though.
[02:09:03.716 --> 02:09:04.096]  Sorry.
[02:09:04.236 --> 02:09:05.757]  And of course it's all made in America.
[02:09:06.377 --> 02:09:08.237]  And we have the American Berkey.
[02:09:08.257 --> 02:09:09.698]  They'll sell the British Berkey if you want that.
[02:09:10.558 --> 02:09:12.318]  But they have the American Berkey even better.
[02:09:12.738 --> 02:09:14.038]  We have one right here in the office.
[02:09:14.799 --> 02:09:21.700]  I just moved the office Oscar fish we have into a bigger tank today and we've been filling up the tank with Berkey water so he's very happy.
[02:09:23.369 --> 02:09:34.472]  But seriously, they've got the new travel Berkey, they've got sports Berkeys, they've got all this, and you can't count on the government if there's a bird flu outbreak, or if we go to war with Iran, or some type of attack, or whatever happens.
[02:09:34.532 --> 02:09:40.593]  All the time, I hear locally on the news, we're in different cities around me, boil your water this week, the sewage overflowed into it.
[02:09:40.993 --> 02:09:47.474]  In LA, they drink water toilet to tap, where the sewer water is recycled and people drink that.
[02:09:48.115 --> 02:09:50.215]  And by the way, a fish, speaking of fish,
[02:09:52.210 --> 02:09:53.471]  I was thinking about this today.
[02:09:54.351 --> 02:10:03.697]  If you take tap water in any major city full of chlorine and fluoride, and you put it in a fish bowl, and you put a fish in there, it's going to die in a day.
[02:10:03.717 --> 02:10:07.559]  Depending on the species, it could die in two hours, it could die in two days.
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:09.861]  Depending on how tough the fish is.
[02:10:13.183 --> 02:10:19.587]  I guess it was about a year ago, I was talking to a guy at the neighborhood pool.
[02:10:21.507 --> 02:10:22.348]  What's the name of the company?
[02:10:22.408 --> 02:10:23.369]  Pool Aid, yeah.
[02:10:23.869 --> 02:10:28.994]  And I was at the neighborhood pool, and he was talking about how their company does hot tubs, pools, private pools, everything.
[02:10:29.014 --> 02:10:30.315]  And he goes, yeah, no, no.
[02:10:30.375 --> 02:10:35.099]  He goes, I watch your show here, you talk about fluoride and chlorine, and he listed a bunch of other stuff.
[02:10:35.119 --> 02:10:42.986]  And he said, Alex, did you know that we can fill a pool here in Austin with Austin water
[02:10:43.886 --> 02:10:53.108]  And for the first two weeks, we don't have to add any chemicals unless it's a heavy-use pool, because if you get a bunch of swim teams in there, you know, an eight-year-old's all urinating in the pool, he said it's a little bit different.
[02:10:54.249 --> 02:11:10.413]  But he said with an average-use pool, for two weeks in Austin, there is no chemicalization needed because the level of chlorine in the pool water from the municipal Austin water supply is actually a little higher than what you would normally put in the pool.
[02:11:10.653 --> 02:11:12.093]  And it takes a few weeks for that to break down.
[02:11:13.516 --> 02:11:17.379]  So then I talked to a pool guy a few months later.
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:18.560]  I saw him at my neighbor's house.
[02:11:18.580 --> 02:11:19.661]  There was a little pool in his backyard.
[02:11:20.002 --> 02:11:23.545]  And I asked the pool guy, I said, hey, when you put pool water in, do you need to add chlorine?
[02:11:23.565 --> 02:11:25.967]  And he said, no, not at first, for the first week or two.
[02:11:26.267 --> 02:11:27.328]  Got the same story.
[02:11:27.348 --> 02:11:28.829]  So I talked to two different pool guys.
[02:11:28.869 --> 02:11:31.772]  My neighbor's pool guy and the local pool aid company.
[02:11:33.733 --> 02:11:37.096]  And it's higher than what a pool normally has.
[02:11:37.156 --> 02:11:38.798]  Folks, if you drink pool water, you get sick.
[02:11:38.818 --> 02:11:41.200]  I mean, if you throw a fish in pool water, it's going to die.
[02:11:42.759 --> 02:11:43.800]  You shower in it.
[02:11:44.641 --> 02:11:45.261]  You inhale it.
[02:11:45.282 --> 02:11:47.323]  It goes through your biggest organ in your body, your skin.
[02:11:48.384 --> 02:11:49.145]  You drink it.
[02:11:50.466 --> 02:11:51.668]  And then there's bottled water.
[02:11:52.508 --> 02:11:56.912]  I mean, I had a Berkey here in the office about five years ago.
[02:11:56.933 --> 02:11:59.135]  It fell off the table once and got dented.
[02:11:59.155 --> 02:12:00.556]  For some reason we quit using it.
[02:12:01.437 --> 02:12:04.820]  And we just got another one a few months ago.
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:07.843]  And sometimes I forget to bring Berkey water from home.
[02:12:08.985 --> 02:12:12.046]  Bob, I'm really getting into a spiel here, but this is actually news.
[02:12:12.066 --> 02:12:15.287]  We're going to get to Debbie in just a second and your calls and the other news, but this is important.
[02:12:15.647 --> 02:12:16.767]  This isn't even a plug right now.
[02:12:17.928 --> 02:12:19.848]  And so I go by bottled water.
[02:12:20.348 --> 02:12:23.489]  And then I remember, wait, I know this, but I'm still doing it.
[02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:26.930]  Just type in bottled water more toxic than regular water.
[02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:27.891]  Something like that into Google.
[02:12:27.911 --> 02:12:29.851]  You'll get probably 50 reports.
[02:12:29.871 --> 02:12:30.992]  I mean, I've seen a whole bunch of them.
[02:12:31.812 --> 02:12:35.213]  Remember Gannon water in New York like five years ago killed people?
[02:12:35.713 --> 02:12:37.354]  Or they found Coca-Cola water?
[02:12:39.466 --> 02:12:43.209]  Their brand of water in England had deadly toxic poison in it at high levels.
[02:12:44.429 --> 02:12:49.313]  These are big plants, folks, with big filters, and they get problems, and they're charcoal-based.
[02:12:49.913 --> 02:12:51.474]  All it does is take the taste out.
[02:12:52.375 --> 02:12:56.497]  And, I mean, seriously, folks, Dannon Water killed people in upstate New York.
[02:12:56.517 --> 02:12:57.958]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[02:12:59.219 --> 02:13:00.380]  You'll save so much money.
[02:13:00.928 --> 02:13:02.109]  I mean, what's a little bottle of water?
[02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.790]  Like a dollar?
[02:13:02.810 --> 02:13:05.532]  A big bottle is like two bucks or a dollar and sixty-nine or something?
[02:13:06.633 --> 02:13:13.038]  I mean, in just a few months you'll pay for your big Berkey and it's the preeminent model worldwide.
[02:13:13.478 --> 02:13:20.143]  Debbie, I've already done the big plug there, but I got off into a rant, but how are we drinking tap water if fish will die in it?
[02:13:20.663 --> 02:13:21.084]  I don't know.
[02:13:21.124 --> 02:13:25.487]  You know, my fish lived four years and it was a bait and they said they only last one year.
[02:13:25.507 --> 02:13:28.750]  And it lived four years in Berkey water.
[02:13:29.685 --> 02:13:36.571]  In fact, the poor thing finally died of old age, and so I have a great testimony about my fish.
[02:13:37.031 --> 02:13:50.202]  But, you know, it's like I always tell people, if you love your family so much that you're not burping your water, then just go ahead and buy a little rat poison, make spaghetti sauce for dinner, and put a little pinch of it in.
[02:13:50.442 --> 02:13:51.223]  Nobody will notice.
[02:13:51.263 --> 02:13:52.224]  You won't taste it.
[02:13:52.664 --> 02:13:54.726]  You won't see it, but you just might.
[02:13:55.478 --> 02:14:05.827]  Get a little bit of that in your kidneys and in your liver and then as time goes by it will accumulate more and more until finally you get sick and die at an early age from something and they don't know what.
[02:14:07.549 --> 02:14:15.616]  Well, it's admitted that calcium fluoride isn't that bad for you, that's naturally occurring, but stannous fluoride settles in the bones and causes bone fractures.
[02:14:16.837 --> 02:14:22.598]  And what about, you know, like the chlorine and things, you know, that stuff can't be good for you no matter what they tell you.
[02:14:22.618 --> 02:14:24.879]  And by the way, it just kills the amoebas.
[02:14:24.959 --> 02:14:26.399]  It just kills the bacteria.
[02:14:26.479 --> 02:14:29.240]  If you're lucky, you're still drinking the dead amoebas.
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:30.280]  That's right.
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:31.140]  That's right.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:36.221]  And they're accumulating in your system, and then you wonder why you don't feel very good.
[02:14:36.561 --> 02:14:42.903]  Fibromyalgia has become such a big thing, especially in women, and this
[02:14:44.232 --> 02:14:44.892]  What is it called?
[02:14:44.992 --> 02:14:46.873]  Oh, the chronic fatigue syndrome?
[02:14:46.893 --> 02:14:48.773]  Yeah, that's been linked to the toxins in the water.
[02:14:49.134 --> 02:14:52.335]  Absolutely, they've been linked to the toxins in the water.
[02:14:52.415 --> 02:14:55.716]  And so I really encourage people to get a Berkey.
[02:14:56.056 --> 02:14:58.096]  You know, hurricane season is coming.
[02:14:58.236 --> 02:14:59.817]  We surely do not want
[02:15:00.359 --> 02:15:06.481]  People to be waiting to get their systems, you know, while emergencies happen.
[02:15:06.502 --> 02:15:11.283]  Well, there's all sorts of crises looming, but the crises is going on every day, drinking that stuff.
[02:15:11.584 --> 02:15:12.864]  You also have shower filters.
[02:15:12.884 --> 02:15:14.025]  Tell them about the shower filters.
[02:15:14.045 --> 02:15:15.165]  Tell them about sports bottles.
[02:15:15.525 --> 02:15:17.566]  Tell them about big Berkeys with the fluoride elements.
[02:15:17.886 --> 02:15:19.147]  Tell them about the specials, Debbie.
[02:15:19.627 --> 02:15:26.910]  Okay, well, our specials are, actually, we have the KDS shower filters on sale for $35, and they are excellent.
[02:15:26.930 --> 02:15:29.851]  They're normally $49, and in the nine years that I've
[02:15:30.359 --> 02:15:31.060]  We're good to go.
[02:15:37.884 --> 02:15:40.706]  They're really excellent.
[02:15:40.746 --> 02:15:51.752]  By the way, before I had you as a sponsor, I would use shower filters and the stuff you buy at Home Depot, the element is about half the size of the element you guys have.
[02:15:51.792 --> 02:15:54.074]  It's the same thing with your sports bottles, your portable ones.
[02:15:54.394 --> 02:16:00.397]  Your element's got to be three times the size of the other sports bottles I bought years ago when I was going on a camping trip.
[02:16:00.437 --> 02:16:02.819]  So, you guys have bigger and better in everything.
[02:16:03.159 --> 02:16:04.240]  Yes, we really do.
[02:16:05.615 --> 02:16:15.362]  And our specials are, like, if you get a Berkey light with the lights for $259, we'll go ahead and throw in a free shower filter with that.
[02:16:15.903 --> 02:16:18.364]  Or you can get two Berkey sports bottles.
[02:16:18.444 --> 02:16:20.386]  Just let me know you're an Alex Jones listener.
[02:16:20.993 --> 02:16:22.855]  And we'll be glad to go ahead and do that.
[02:16:22.955 --> 02:16:29.202]  And they do 600 plus refills of tap water, 130 something of swamp water, the little portable Berkeys.
[02:16:29.642 --> 02:16:30.783]  You get 5 for $100 or what, 1 for $25?
[02:16:30.984 --> 02:16:31.324]  What is it?
[02:16:31.424 --> 02:16:31.684]  Right.
[02:16:31.704 --> 02:16:34.427]  You get 1 for $25 of the generic labeled or 5 for
[02:16:38.391 --> 02:16:40.973]  99.
[02:16:38.511 --> 02:16:40.973]  Okay, folks, give her a call right now.
[02:16:41.053 --> 02:16:41.734]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:16:42.495 --> 02:16:45.857]  Give her a call.
[02:16:45.877 --> 02:16:46.458]  The phone's busy.
[02:16:46.478 --> 02:16:47.038]  Leave her a number.
[02:16:47.319 --> 02:16:48.179]  She'll call you right back.
[02:16:48.199 --> 02:16:49.741]  888-803-4438 or berkeywater.com.
[02:16:54.285 --> 02:16:57.567]  Berkeywater.com or order from Infowars.com.
[02:16:57.587 --> 02:17:05.674]  They're the big national maker and distributor so you get wholesale prices and Debbie just handles the calls from this radio show and a few others that she does.
[02:17:05.955 --> 02:17:06.595]  Give her a call.
[02:17:06.675 --> 02:17:08.317]  Great Christian lady.
[02:17:08.337 --> 02:17:13.101]  1-888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[02:17:13.141 --> 02:17:14.082]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:17:14.102 --> 02:17:14.802]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:17:14.962 --> 02:17:15.223]  Bye-bye.
[02:17:15.523 --> 02:17:15.903]  You bet.
[02:17:16.524 --> 02:17:17.104]  Folks, I'm sorry.
[02:17:17.164 --> 02:17:18.325]  I meant to have her on for three minutes.
[02:17:18.926 --> 02:17:19.586]  I had her on for 12.
[02:17:20.996 --> 02:17:22.077]  I don't apologize though.
[02:17:22.297 --> 02:17:23.697]  I mean, I did but I really don't.
[02:17:23.757 --> 02:17:26.879]  I mean, I talked about water, I talked about the insanity of it.
[02:17:26.899 --> 02:17:29.520]  888-803-4438.
[02:17:30.121 --> 02:17:31.361]  Give her a call.
[02:17:31.381 --> 02:17:34.243]  888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[02:17:34.543 --> 02:17:36.844]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get the discounts.
[02:17:37.404 --> 02:17:39.145]  On the website you can list what free gifts you want.
[02:17:39.365 --> 02:17:44.288]  Alright, I promise, Tom, Scott, Chris, Fred and others, your calls are straight ahead and a ton of news!
[02:17:45.751 --> 02:17:47.332]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:17:47.733 --> 02:17:53.478]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:17:53.718 --> 02:17:58.863]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:17:59.203 --> 02:18:08.511]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:18:08.852 --> 02:18:13.776]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:18:14.096 --> 02:18:18.118]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:18:18.318 --> 02:18:23.100]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:18:23.441 --> 02:18:29.404]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:18:29.704 --> 02:18:35.166]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:35.186 --> 02:18:36.427]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:42.970 --> 02:18:44.070]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:47.511 --> 02:18:48.672]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.072 --> 02:18:54.553]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.133 --> 02:18:55.633]  That's right.
[02:18:55.953 --> 02:18:58.234]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.554 --> 02:19:05.716]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.272 --> 02:19:13.976]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.416 --> 02:19:19.199]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.881 --> 02:19:24.902]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.702 --> 02:19:29.823]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.203 --> 02:19:30.443]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.463 --> 02:19:32.404]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.484 --> 02:19:32.784]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.084 --> 02:19:33.344]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.215 --> 02:19:48.737]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.417 --> 02:19:59.063]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:20:00.064 --> 02:20:09.590]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:20:10.629 --> 02:20:15.511]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:16.911 --> 02:20:24.634]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:25.314 --> 02:20:27.235]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.255 --> 02:20:27.595]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:37.982]  516-8736.
[02:20:39.604 --> 02:20:40.305]  Call now.
[02:20:40.505 --> 02:20:44.229]  Operators are standing by to take your order for a free subscription.
[02:20:45.611 --> 02:20:49.655]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:49.875 --> 02:20:53.279]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:53.459 --> 02:20:56.883]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:57.173 --> 02:21:00.396]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:21:00.456 --> 02:21:05.920]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:15.588]  When we do our programs, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:15.708 --> 02:21:17.089]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:21:17.109 --> 02:21:22.494]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function instead on
[02:21:22.993 --> 02:21:27.435]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:27.515 --> 02:21:28.876]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:29.036 --> 02:21:32.498]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:21:32.518 --> 02:21:33.498]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:48.155 --> 02:21:54.197]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.797 --> 02:21:57.778]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:02.899 --> 02:22:05.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Kansas.
[02:22:05.940 --> 02:22:06.940]  We're going to move quick here.
[02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:07.660]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:22:09.361 --> 02:22:09.661]  Hello?
[02:22:10.161 --> 02:22:10.601]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:11.161 --> 02:22:13.422]  Yeah, Alex, listen to your program.
[02:22:13.502 --> 02:22:14.482]  I'm really enjoying it.
[02:22:15.037 --> 02:22:19.960]  I've got your DVD of 9-11 Road to Martial Law.
[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:20.700]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:21.381 --> 02:22:30.886]  And in that, you state that Marvin Bush was over the complexes, security over the complexes.
[02:22:30.946 --> 02:22:33.667]  Yeah, that was in several mainstream East Coast newspapers.
[02:22:33.687 --> 02:22:34.988]  We have copies of the newspapers.
[02:22:35.388 --> 02:22:38.830]  Okay, I've got two questions I need to ask you to clear something up.
[02:22:39.310 --> 02:22:42.292]  Now, the other night on, I believe it was the History Channel,
[02:22:43.161 --> 02:22:47.187]  Uh, they had a program on called, uh, The Man Who Predicted 9-11.
[02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:51.614]  And it was the guy who ran security on the two buildings.
[02:22:51.754 --> 02:22:52.635]  Yeah, John O'Neill.
[02:22:53.096 --> 02:22:54.959]  Yeah, did he work for Marvin Bush?
[02:22:56.647 --> 02:23:06.292]  He was hired, let me be specific, they have the company that administered the security, and then the Port Authority also had its own security.
[02:23:06.572 --> 02:23:07.953]  There were about five different layers.
[02:23:07.973 --> 02:23:13.376]  There was New York City security, there was fire marshal security, there was all sorts of surveillance.
[02:23:13.416 --> 02:23:19.899]  You had the command bunker across the street at Building 7 for the city and the state and the CIA and Defense Intelligence.
[02:23:20.559 --> 02:23:21.460]  All in one building.
[02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:23.782]  But I'd have to look that up.
[02:23:24.242 --> 02:23:36.591]  I know that the FBI anti-terrorism director had left a few months before and then been hired as the head of security and then died that day in the building.
[02:23:37.191 --> 02:23:40.814]  Well, you know, I don't want to make you mad because I'm with you a hundred percent.
[02:23:41.114 --> 02:23:47.358]  But they had a guy up there in Kansas City that was on the other day, and I don't know his name, and he was really cutting into you.
[02:23:47.858 --> 02:23:49.960]  And he said that you lied about the people that
[02:23:50.543 --> 02:23:53.846]  I mean, whoever the KCXL host is, I'd be more than happy to come on their show.
[02:23:53.906 --> 02:23:55.087]  I'm not going to have him on my show.
[02:24:22.521 --> 02:24:32.605]  Another question, they were talking about on National Geographic Channel the other night, they were going through 9-11, and they said that the plane, Flight 77, that went into the Pentagon,
[02:24:37.253 --> 02:24:40.375]  I have heard that there was only a 16 foot hole there.
[02:24:40.715 --> 02:24:41.356]  Yes, there was.
[02:24:41.416 --> 02:24:43.277]  And then it collapsed and it was much larger.
[02:24:43.877 --> 02:24:44.217]  Oh, okay.
[02:24:44.257 --> 02:24:50.861]  I didn't know because they said... No, we have the photos of the 16 foot hole and then it collapsed after they'd been spraying it with water.
[02:24:50.982 --> 02:24:55.464]  Yeah, what they said was that it was a two story hole, 77 feet wide.
[02:24:56.185 --> 02:24:57.826]  Yeah, that's not true, sir.
[02:24:58.466 --> 02:25:00.027]  Okay, now one other thing.
[02:25:00.067 --> 02:25:01.068]  Well, let me go back.
[02:25:01.108 --> 02:25:02.148]  Let me go back, okay?
[02:25:02.729 --> 02:25:04.470]  I want to go back to the first thing you raised.
[02:25:06.106 --> 02:25:27.145]  I don't have it in front of me, but if you go to marshalllaw911.info, every article, every document, every claim, every bill, every snooze story that we put in that film is on the website.
[02:25:27.466 --> 02:25:30.789]  I don't have my computer on here in front of me because it seems to be a distraction,
[02:25:31.645 --> 02:25:50.049]  I can go, I guess during the break, try to pull that up or just type Marvin Bush ran security on the towers into Google and if memory serves, there were two, and they're in the film, there were two mainstream big newspapers that reported on that.
[02:25:50.729 --> 02:25:56.850]  So certainly John O'Neill was the head of building security
[02:25:57.757 --> 02:26:01.618]  But that doesn't mean that he's the head of the company that ran security.
[02:26:01.658 --> 02:26:05.199]  That's what I was wondering, if he might not work for Marvin.
[02:26:05.239 --> 02:26:07.580]  But I mean, let me just add something to this.
[02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:09.801]  I don't know the particulars of that.
[02:26:10.501 --> 02:26:11.661]  Let me just add something to this.
[02:26:11.681 --> 02:26:12.721]  This is what these people do.
[02:26:14.002 --> 02:26:15.422]  This is what they did on Larry King Live.
[02:26:15.482 --> 02:26:21.344]  They say, it's an urban legend, it's a lie that the FBI allowed the bin Laden's to fly out.
[02:26:23.357 --> 02:26:32.765]  And didn't question them why on September 16th they did interview them at this Miami airport.
[02:26:34.487 --> 02:26:36.369]  So by saying that, they're telling the truth.
[02:26:36.409 --> 02:26:41.994]  They go, see, they did interview them and they didn't let them fly out when all commercial air traffic was grounded.
[02:26:42.014 --> 02:26:43.615]  Well, see, it's a shell game.
[02:26:44.432 --> 02:26:49.235]  There were flights on September 12th and 13th when all traffic was grounded.
[02:26:49.275 --> 02:26:52.518]  Miami Herald, Associated Press, Reuters had sent all my films.
[02:26:52.758 --> 02:26:55.420]  Flew out 168 members of the Bin Laden family.
[02:26:55.700 --> 02:26:57.341]  The FBI was not allowed to talk to them.
[02:26:57.561 --> 02:27:01.144]  They were allowed to fly out when all commercial air traffic and even private traffic was grounded.
[02:27:01.504 --> 02:27:01.744]  Now!
[02:27:02.985 --> 02:27:03.205]  Now!
[02:27:04.386 --> 02:27:08.949]  Then the media fixated on more Bin Ladens flying out a few days later
[02:27:10.296 --> 02:27:11.176]  We're on the march.
[02:27:11.196 --> 02:27:12.836]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:30:46.793 --> 02:30:53.461]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.662 --> 02:31:01.971]  As for the honesty of this host, of Alex Jones, the guy you're listening to, me, I make mistakes.
[02:31:03.913 --> 02:31:06.336]  I do the best job I can, though, to tell the truth.
[02:31:08.934 --> 02:31:11.836]  That's the difference between myself and a lot of mainstream individuals.
[02:31:11.896 --> 02:31:13.518]  They have their own view of the world.
[02:31:13.538 --> 02:31:15.399]  They have the team they think they're playing on.
[02:31:16.020 --> 02:31:18.882]  And then they twist everything they do in that direction.
[02:31:20.663 --> 02:31:25.767]  But I really do get tired of people attacking myself with straw dogs, straw men.
[02:31:27.028 --> 02:31:28.269]  And you know what a straw man is.
[02:31:28.970 --> 02:31:30.651]  You don't attack the real person.
[02:31:30.711 --> 02:31:33.853]  You build something that's false, that's fake, that's flawed.
[02:31:34.534 --> 02:31:38.577]  And then you put on that straw man face of false claims and then say they said it.
[02:31:39.898 --> 02:32:04.860]  There's a local former UT professor here in Austin, who's just a sad person, I don't even really dislike him, who goes all over the internet, all over message boards, and posts things that I haven't said, or maybe one or two of sometimes 50 plus quotes, I mean there might be more than that, of all these crazy quotes, and then maybe two or three of them are actual real things I've said,
[02:32:05.706 --> 02:32:11.271]  And then the rest are either outright fabrications or are twisted.
[02:32:14.354 --> 02:32:20.620]  The other night I was looking at some of these and somebody sent me an email and I'm sitting there and the individual sends me emails too poking at me.
[02:32:21.241 --> 02:32:23.643]  It really just reminds me that I'm doing a good job though.
[02:32:23.663 --> 02:32:26.706]  A lot of times when I'm out of energy at midnight up here working,
[02:32:27.398 --> 02:32:35.665]  I'll see some hate-filled things some national talk show host has said about me, or somebody will send me an audio clip, or some new big national publication attacks me.
[02:32:36.325 --> 02:32:38.027]  And it just reminds me who we're fighting.
[02:32:39.888 --> 02:32:44.091]  But then there's other people who just attack me because I guess I'm kind of a big dog.
[02:32:44.532 --> 02:32:45.793]  I don't see myself as that.
[02:32:45.833 --> 02:32:47.915]  It's very humbling that millions of people listen to me.
[02:32:49.196 --> 02:32:54.480]  And they just want to attack me to get me to respond for publicity for themselves.
[02:32:54.940 --> 02:32:55.821]  You have to remember that.
[02:32:59.207 --> 02:33:06.691]  I remember a big national radio show for weeks and weeks of years ago attacked me saying, Alex Jones, you're a liar!
[02:33:07.391 --> 02:33:11.653]  Bush didn't sign anything called W1999 telling the FBI.
[02:33:11.673 --> 02:33:13.054]  This was like four years ago actually.
[02:33:13.654 --> 02:33:16.335]  Back when only people saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:33:17.416 --> 02:33:23.719]  And they would get on the air because I was sent the clips of the show over and over again by listeners.
[02:33:25.192 --> 02:33:29.616]  And they would make up things I hadn't said about 9-11, and then attribute it to me.
[02:33:29.836 --> 02:33:34.880]  Or, they would just say, Alex claims Bush told the FBI to back off the Bin Ladens.
[02:33:35.420 --> 02:33:36.601]  Alex is a liar.
[02:33:36.661 --> 02:33:39.203]  Where's W1999 Alex?
[02:33:39.523 --> 02:33:40.364]  Show us that proof!
[02:33:40.544 --> 02:33:41.305]  Oh, he won't do it!
[02:33:41.525 --> 02:33:44.287]  We've challenged him to a debate, but he won't come on!
[02:33:46.589 --> 02:33:48.230]  And then I actually called the host up,
[02:33:49.597 --> 02:33:50.579]  Talk to their assistant.
[02:33:50.599 --> 02:33:52.041]  They said, OK, we'll schedule you.
[02:33:52.081 --> 02:33:52.782]  They never did.
[02:33:52.842 --> 02:33:55.085]  And they were on the air a week later saying I was afraid.
[02:33:55.766 --> 02:33:56.847]  They're liars!
[02:34:00.813 --> 02:34:02.115]  But it isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:34:02.175 --> 02:34:04.959]  It's the issue of these people twist.
[02:34:07.426 --> 02:34:08.607]  And that's what they do.
[02:34:08.747 --> 02:34:15.215]  They just don't agree with what I'm saying, so they're going to twist it in their own brains, and that's the best case scenario.
[02:34:15.235 --> 02:34:15.876]  They don't mean it.
[02:34:15.896 --> 02:34:17.178]  They're not trying to be evil.
[02:34:17.498 --> 02:34:19.601]  They're not openly, consciously trying to lie.
[02:34:20.321 --> 02:34:21.803]  They just convince themselves.
[02:34:21.823 --> 02:34:24.627]  They just look for anything and say it isn't true.
[02:34:25.589 --> 02:34:26.769]  I mean, say it ain't so!
[02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:31.911]  I've gotten emails claiming the troops and the police didn't confiscate guns in New Orleans and surrounding areas.
[02:34:32.572 --> 02:34:34.252]  I've gotten emails saying I lied.
[02:34:34.512 --> 02:34:38.214]  Those weren't real clips of sheriffs saying the feds were sabotaging.
[02:34:39.454 --> 02:34:40.915]  Yes, I just make it all up.
[02:34:41.395 --> 02:34:48.478]  I have received hundreds of emails, dozens and dozens of phone calls in the first two years after I put out Police State 2000.
[02:34:50.572 --> 02:34:55.473]  Which shows the Marines training to take your guns and put you in camps and admitting it's for America.
[02:34:56.713 --> 02:35:09.235]  That shows Delta Force with foreign troops covertly leasing buildings and then blowing them up next door to nursing homes and police chiefs admitting that foreign troops were there and other police chiefs saying they're against it and that the Delta Force tried to bribe them.
[02:35:11.616 --> 02:35:18.477]  I was accused organically, people were just making this up to themselves, of hiring the Coronado.
[02:35:23.012 --> 02:35:24.492]  It's almost the size of an aircraft carrier.
[02:35:24.512 --> 02:35:26.113]  It's the big marine troop carrying ship.
[02:35:26.593 --> 02:35:27.673]  I was accused of hiring it!
[02:35:28.353 --> 02:35:30.854]  I was accused of having 10 hovercraft land!
[02:35:31.314 --> 02:35:34.495]  I was accused of having 50 armored vehicles, warrior vehicles!
[02:35:34.555 --> 02:35:37.957]  I was accused of 3,000 marines and 2,000 foreign troops!
[02:35:38.357 --> 02:35:48.420]  I was accused of shutting down part of Oakland and having helicopters flying around because people couldn't watch that video and couldn't deal with the truth!
[02:35:51.067 --> 02:35:53.089]  They couldn't deal with it!
[02:35:55.771 --> 02:36:01.755]  I'm trying to save my family that happens to live in Austin, Texas, and are living inside this country.
[02:36:03.296 --> 02:36:04.457]  I know this is life and death.
[02:36:04.517 --> 02:36:05.898]  I know we've got a criminal elite.
[02:36:07.019 --> 02:36:08.080]  I know there's an official U.S.
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:11.142]  government plan to carry out 9-11 called Operation Northwoods.
[02:36:13.419 --> 02:36:15.861]  I've got a new film coming out that doesn't even get into 9-11.
[02:36:15.881 --> 02:36:31.351]  I mean, it covers it for maybe 15 minutes or almost two hours, but the main film is about all the admitted official CIA.gov Library of Congress openly admitting our government carried out terror attacks worldwide to blame it on their enemies.
[02:36:31.411 --> 02:36:33.672]  I'm going to take four more calls.
[02:36:33.692 --> 02:36:36.694]  That's all I have time for because I need to get into the news, but Scott in New York.
[02:36:36.714 --> 02:36:37.014]  Go ahead.
[02:36:40.436 --> 02:36:41.057]  Hello, Scott.
[02:36:41.781 --> 02:36:43.582]  Hi Alex, it's a pleasure to speak with you.
[02:36:43.602 --> 02:36:45.503]  Nice talking to you, what's on your mind?
[02:36:45.683 --> 02:36:47.604]  Real quick, I'll go as quickly as I can.
[02:36:48.285 --> 02:36:51.206]  Firstly, I wanted to just mention Oreldo Rivera last night.
[02:36:51.226 --> 02:36:55.068]  I don't know if you saw him on Fox with O'Reilly.
[02:36:55.188 --> 02:36:56.049]  I'm sure it was horrible.
[02:36:56.749 --> 02:36:58.270]  It was just the worst.
[02:36:58.350 --> 02:37:06.314]  I mean, I think he's really trying to run for president in the next four or five years, and trying to get the support of the illegal aliens.
[02:37:06.875 --> 02:37:11.017]  I just want to make sure that the truckers out there know, that the construction workers know,
[02:37:11.567 --> 02:37:30.352]  They better take some time out of their day and call their representatives, because once these illegal aliens become legal, the truck driving jobs are going to go, the construction worker jobs are going to go, and when GM and Ford find they can't continue anymore and they file for some sort of protection, they'll hire the new
[02:37:31.181 --> 02:37:33.003]  Legal, illegal aliens.
[02:37:33.083 --> 02:37:33.863]  They'll hire them.
[02:37:34.144 --> 02:37:37.607]  Sir, that is what the official guest worker program is.
[02:37:38.047 --> 02:37:44.553]  Everyone who's here or can get here for six years, legal, into the Citizenship Project automatically.
[02:37:45.273 --> 02:37:48.036]  And it allows unlimited skilled and unskilled.
[02:37:48.256 --> 02:37:49.357]  That's reform.
[02:37:50.798 --> 02:37:53.000]  I've known about this for
[02:37:53.444 --> 02:37:56.166]  For many, many years, and for ten, twelve years of my life.
[02:37:56.526 --> 02:37:57.847]  Oh no, it's a conspiracy!
[02:37:57.947 --> 02:37:59.107]  Alex is a liar!
[02:38:00.348 --> 02:38:01.309]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:38:01.529 --> 02:38:03.210]  Bush isn't calling for amnesty.
[02:38:03.390 --> 02:38:04.170]  I'm a liar.
[02:38:04.591 --> 02:38:07.252]  No, just to let you know something real quick.
[02:38:07.312 --> 02:38:10.995]  It was funny because since the early 80's I've known about this.
[02:38:11.055 --> 02:38:14.197]  And then around 95 or so, I just said to heck with it.
[02:38:14.617 --> 02:38:16.138]  And I left New York.
[02:38:16.218 --> 02:38:17.118]  I went out to Vegas.
[02:38:17.198 --> 02:38:20.480]  I played poker for a living for about ten years.
[02:38:20.961 --> 02:38:23.222]  And I was out there when 9-1-1 happened.
[02:38:23.692 --> 02:38:27.273]  And my brother called me and said, you believe what they pulled off?
[02:38:27.353 --> 02:38:28.514]  And I said, please.
[02:38:28.974 --> 02:38:30.634]  I said, they couldn't have done this.
[02:38:31.555 --> 02:38:33.515]  And I put it out of my mind.
[02:38:33.715 --> 02:38:35.496]  And for three years I didn't do anything.
[02:38:35.896 --> 02:38:42.098]  Well, since my brother told me about you, you've rekindled the fire within me to start
[02:38:44.566 --> 02:38:49.227]  Fighting the New World Order, and now it's so evident that there's a New World Order.
[02:38:49.547 --> 02:38:55.629]  Back when I was fighting it, really, people laughed when I mentioned Bilderberg or the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:38:56.049 --> 02:39:01.130]  I even had to prove to myself by going down to Fifth Avenue to look at the building.
[02:39:01.570 --> 02:39:04.131]  I looked at it myself and said, well, there it is, the building.
[02:39:04.151 --> 02:39:05.111]  They never mention it.
[02:39:05.451 --> 02:39:06.772]  The presidents come from there.
[02:39:06.812 --> 02:39:08.432]  The vice presidents come from there.
[02:39:09.182 --> 02:39:11.143]  All the ambassadors and so on and so forth.
[02:39:11.163 --> 02:39:13.283]  You're talking about the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:39:13.303 --> 02:39:14.904]  What's it on 34th Street?
[02:39:15.964 --> 02:39:17.205]  No, I think it's further up.
[02:39:17.265 --> 02:39:18.525]  It's like on 54th.
[02:39:19.085 --> 02:39:28.868]  But regardless, I went down there myself in 1983 to see it for myself as a young guy to say it really does exist.
[02:39:29.268 --> 02:39:33.550]  Because the newspapers and the media would deny it existed.
[02:39:36.282 --> 02:39:38.003]  Sir, you're an amazing caller.
[02:39:38.583 --> 02:39:39.503]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:39:39.524 --> 02:39:44.165]  Because I just had him print up all the mainstream news articles about Marvin running security.
[02:39:45.085 --> 02:39:47.506]  I know you have a lot, but I'll mention another thing.
[02:39:47.566 --> 02:39:56.829]  On George Report right now, the Cato Institute, they got it right now that President George W. Bush is shown disdain and indifference for the U.S.
[02:39:56.909 --> 02:39:57.570]  Constitution.
[02:39:57.630 --> 02:39:58.750]  It's a nice little article.
[02:39:59.210 --> 02:40:04.012]  One other thing, if I could one day speak with you about Mel Gibson.
[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:08.942]  And what he really is, what a true patriot he really is.
[02:40:08.962 --> 02:40:10.522]  Maybe you already know that.
[02:40:10.662 --> 02:40:11.362]  He certainly is.
[02:40:11.422 --> 02:40:12.223]  I appreciate the call.
[02:40:12.263 --> 02:40:13.523]  Call me back again, Scott.
[02:40:13.563 --> 02:40:14.243]  We'll talk more.
[02:40:14.704 --> 02:40:15.904]  I've got this other news I've got to cover.
[02:40:15.924 --> 02:40:18.945]  I want to talk to Chris Fred and Umar, I believe.
[02:40:19.725 --> 02:40:29.329]  But before I do that, I just asked my staff to Google it and they brought in the original source, but it's still not in here.
[02:40:29.509 --> 02:40:33.130]  There were two mainstream news articles, big East Coast papers.
[02:40:33.886 --> 02:40:34.686]  And they're in the film!
[02:40:35.047 --> 02:40:38.488]  When I claim it in the film, you can see it, and it's on martiallaw901.info.
[02:40:39.569 --> 02:40:41.830]  I'll find those when I get off the air and post them on InfoWars.
[02:40:43.471 --> 02:40:49.093]  But here it is directly from Barbara Bush's own autobiography, published in 2003.
[02:40:49.133 --> 02:40:54.696]  It's called Reflections by Barbara Bush.
[02:40:56.157 --> 02:40:58.538]  In my film, I have the page number.
[02:41:00.260 --> 02:41:04.701]  It says, we later learned that Marvin had been in New York on the subway under Wall Street on his way to the meeting.
[02:41:05.081 --> 02:41:07.702]  The train came to a stop and they had no idea what happened.
[02:41:08.102 --> 02:41:11.862]  Eventually they were evacuated, single file onto a platform and then onto the subway.
[02:41:12.322 --> 02:41:15.363]  They were told either to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge or walk uptown.
[02:41:16.443 --> 02:41:17.383]  But get out of there!
[02:41:17.463 --> 02:41:19.404]  Marvin said smoke and debris were everywhere.
[02:41:19.784 --> 02:41:24.945]  He walked 70 blocks back to the hotel, stopping in front of the electronics store to watch TV of what had happened.
[02:41:25.305 --> 02:41:29.786]  Marvin told us that the people of New York were very supportive, offering water and encouragement.
[02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:31.920]  Where's the part about?
[02:41:32.861 --> 02:41:35.622]  Needless to say, we learned how close Marvin was to the disaster.
[02:41:35.662 --> 02:41:36.662]  Grateful he was safe.
[02:41:37.082 --> 02:41:41.183]  I also learned that my nephew, Jim Pierce, narrowly escaped injury or possible death.
[02:41:41.203 --> 02:41:46.005]  He was scheduled to attend a meeting on the 102nd floor of the South Tower, which was the second building.
[02:41:46.065 --> 02:41:51.966]  However, the night before the meeting was moved to an adjacent building because the group had outgrown the conference room.
[02:41:51.986 --> 02:41:55.928]  Jim later learned that 12 people were in the room where he was supposed to be
[02:41:59.139 --> 02:42:01.120]  At 11, where 11 died.
[02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:02.221]  I'm trying to find it here.
[02:42:02.281 --> 02:42:02.882]  Here's one.
[02:42:04.302 --> 02:42:05.803]  This is out of American Reporter.
[02:42:05.823 --> 02:42:09.386]  This is mainstream news, but this is about the other mainstream news articles.
[02:42:09.926 --> 02:42:11.427]  They just gave me a huge stack here.
[02:42:12.428 --> 02:42:14.869]  Secrecy surrounds 9-11 investigation.
[02:42:14.909 --> 02:42:18.412]  A member of the commission investigating September 11th attacks in Washington and New York.
[02:42:18.852 --> 02:42:22.194]  Say, we'll push for a wide-ranging... Where's the part here?
[02:42:23.275 --> 02:42:23.995]  Trying to find it.
[02:42:25.596 --> 02:42:26.177]  Oh, here it is.
[02:42:27.249 --> 02:42:30.010]  This is an article out of the American Reporter.
[02:42:31.391 --> 02:42:34.452]  Secrecy surrounds the Bush Brothers' role in 9-11 security.
[02:42:34.492 --> 02:42:39.734]  A company provided security at New York City's World Trade Center, Dulles International Airport.
[02:42:40.114 --> 02:42:40.614]  Oh, that's right.
[02:42:41.115 --> 02:42:43.155]  They were running security on one of the planes, or two of the planes.
[02:42:43.536 --> 02:42:54.720]  In Washington, D.C., the United Airlines, between 1995 and 2001, was backed by a private Kuwaiti-American investment firm with ties to a brother of President Bush and the family, according to records obtained by the American Reporter.
[02:42:55.620 --> 02:42:59.461]  And then it says Marvin P. Bush, a younger brother of George Bush, was the principal in the company.
[02:43:00.321 --> 02:43:03.782]  And then it goes on to say that he worked in security projects for the company.
[02:43:04.763 --> 02:43:07.203]  And it's Securicon.
[02:43:07.603 --> 02:43:14.145]  Nonetheless, public records reveal that the firm formerly named Securicon listed Bush on its board of directors and a significant shareholder firm.
[02:43:14.705 --> 02:43:15.826]  That's not the one, though.
[02:43:15.946 --> 02:43:18.246]  There's two that are mainstream.
[02:43:19.167 --> 02:43:20.647]  I'll have to go to break and read through these.
[02:43:20.667 --> 02:43:22.108]  They just walked in and gave them to me.
[02:43:22.128 --> 02:43:23.688]  Literally, there's one, two, three, four.
[02:43:24.673 --> 02:43:26.394]  Five, six articles here.
[02:43:28.276 --> 02:43:29.517]  The Counter-Terrorists.
[02:43:29.537 --> 02:43:31.138]  This is one about John O'Neill.
[02:43:31.758 --> 02:43:36.502]  This was out of the New Yorker magazine about his role.
[02:43:37.082 --> 02:43:39.024]  This is... How many pages is this?
[02:43:39.044 --> 02:43:40.025]  Like 18 pages?
[02:43:40.465 --> 02:43:41.126]  I'll have to scan.
[02:43:41.146 --> 02:43:42.607]  I'm a speed reader, but not that fast.
[02:43:42.647 --> 02:43:43.387]  I'll scan through it.
[02:43:43.748 --> 02:43:44.968]  But bottom line, it's in the film.
[02:43:44.988 --> 02:43:47.450]  We've got the news articles, and we'll go ahead and repost those.
[02:43:48.011 --> 02:43:52.174]  They're on martiallaw911.info, but there's like 700 articles or something there.
[02:43:52.214 --> 02:43:53.455]  I've got to go find it.
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:56.102]  Guys, you're listening right now.
[02:43:56.623 --> 02:43:57.624]  Keep looking.
[02:43:58.305 --> 02:44:03.873]  There's two mainstream newspapers, okay, that get into this.
[02:44:03.933 --> 02:44:04.875]  Those are the ones I need.
[02:44:05.015 --> 02:44:08.500]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to Chris in Florida.
[02:44:08.520 --> 02:44:09.141]  Chris, welcome.
[02:44:10.191 --> 02:44:11.032]  Thanks Alex.
[02:44:11.072 --> 02:44:15.457]  I'm calling about the bird flu and all sorts of other diseases that we're not allowed to treat ourselves with.
[02:44:15.497 --> 02:44:19.482]  These are suppressed treatments and cures like ozone I've mentioned.
[02:44:19.502 --> 02:44:29.194]  We need to put more pressure on our congress critters to have the FDA approve such devices as ozone generators.
[02:44:30.074 --> 02:44:30.775]  For human use.
[02:44:30.935 --> 02:44:37.341]  That's where the issue is because you'll be prosecuted if the FDA finds out that you're even treating yourself with something like ozone.
[02:44:38.161 --> 02:44:44.186]  Or if you have what's called a medical-grade ozone generator because that implies it's for human use also.
[02:44:44.927 --> 02:44:53.314]  So we have our own FDA that's preventing us from taking care of ourselves, let alone the boards of medicine that come down on the doctors.
[02:44:53.474 --> 02:44:57.838]  Well, with Codex Salamentarius, they're trying to make vitamin C be a prescription.
[02:44:59.486 --> 02:45:02.127]  The intravenous is, that's actually a good thing.
[02:45:03.028 --> 02:45:03.848]  No sir, no sir.
[02:45:03.868 --> 02:45:10.391]  In Europe, and the US is trying to adopt it, we're talking about shutting down many of the over-the-counter supplements.
[02:45:11.031 --> 02:45:11.392]  Really?
[02:45:11.492 --> 02:45:14.413]  Wow, because I know vitamin C, you can take that in huge amounts.
[02:45:14.453 --> 02:45:15.573]  They try to say it's dangerous.
[02:45:15.934 --> 02:45:19.895]  You can take up to, you know what they say, the bowel tolerance, 15-20 milligrams a day.
[02:45:19.915 --> 02:45:27.439]  Well, they just had a big Canadian study where it was knocking cancers out, an official, multi-level, double-blind study.
[02:45:28.706 --> 02:45:33.970]  Yeah, yeah, it's just a wonderful treatment for so many different diseases, viral and bacterial also.
[02:45:34.991 --> 02:45:37.233]  I wanted to bring up another talk show host.
[02:45:37.273 --> 02:45:38.113]  Have you heard of Lionel?
[02:45:39.294 --> 02:45:39.574]  No.
[02:45:40.535 --> 02:45:45.779]  Well, for the past month or so, since you had Charlie Sheen on, that's when he started really digging into 9-11.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:48.321]  And he had a couple shows.
[02:45:48.601 --> 02:45:52.304]  I left a few messages for you to see if you'd want to call in and be a guest.
[02:45:52.324 --> 02:45:53.745]  But he's on every night.
[02:45:53.805 --> 02:45:54.986]  He covers Flight 93 or
[02:45:56.317 --> 02:45:59.740]  Or tries to cover the lack of wreckage, I guess.
[02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:02.902]  But yeah, he's asking that question all the time.
[02:46:02.942 --> 02:46:05.243]  Talks about 9-11 all the time as an open subject.
[02:46:05.263 --> 02:46:08.626]  If you want to check out his website, it's LionelOnline.com.
[02:46:08.646 --> 02:46:09.326]  Okay, thank you.
[02:46:09.366 --> 02:46:10.367]  I appreciate the call.
[02:46:11.028 --> 02:46:13.089]  Let's talk to Fred in South Dakota.
[02:46:13.109 --> 02:46:13.710]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:15.551]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:46:15.771 --> 02:46:15.991]  Good.
[02:46:16.432 --> 02:46:21.695]  Yes, right before me, I have Tuesday, May 2, 2006, USA Today.
[02:46:22.256 --> 02:46:25.298]  And the headline, and it was the last paper, I might add,
[02:46:25.891 --> 02:46:29.073]  Headline says, thousands boycott work and school.
[02:46:29.513 --> 02:46:40.298]  What the headline should say is that the United States government watches Americans while thousands of illegal immigrants boycott work, school, and run around the country everywhere in public view.
[02:46:40.759 --> 02:46:42.219]  Blocking highways.
[02:46:42.239 --> 02:46:46.642]  By the way, the AP did a good job, but nobody picked it up.
[02:46:46.882 --> 02:46:47.422]  It was called...
[02:46:48.546 --> 02:46:49.847]  No Gringo Day.
[02:46:49.907 --> 02:46:53.189]  We have it posted on InfoWars and Prison Planet right now.
[02:46:53.589 --> 02:46:54.590]  Very racist.
[02:46:54.970 --> 02:46:58.692]  And by the time they were done on the media, it was a day without immigrants.
[02:46:58.792 --> 02:46:59.052]  No.
[02:46:59.613 --> 02:47:02.154]  It was called No Gringo Day.
[02:47:02.735 --> 02:47:04.616]  A day without gringos.
[02:47:04.656 --> 02:47:06.417]  Now the people have got to get this.
[02:47:06.597 --> 02:47:12.841]  When they read this article, the boycott is because the United States has been oppressing them with these felony immigrant laws.
[02:47:13.661 --> 02:47:15.182]  Well, if they don't want to be oppressed,
[02:47:15.595 --> 02:47:18.376]  Go back to Mexico and fix your country.
[02:47:18.616 --> 02:47:20.957]  This is the wrong country to be fixing right now.
[02:47:21.017 --> 02:47:21.678]  Yeah, I don't get it.
[02:47:21.758 --> 02:47:29.281]  Why are they here saying they hate America, they love Mexico, this is Mexico, go back to Europe pilgrim, and that's what's really going on.
[02:47:29.321 --> 02:47:30.982]  That's the majority that are leading these things.
[02:47:31.042 --> 02:47:36.364]  Well, better yet, fix your country first, Mexicans, then come back and fix us.
[02:47:37.205 --> 02:47:38.005]  Absolutely, Fred.
[02:47:38.025 --> 02:47:38.705]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:38.905 --> 02:47:39.606]  Who's up next here?
[02:47:41.546 --> 02:47:42.647]  Osa in Texas, go ahead.
[02:47:44.235 --> 02:47:45.095]  Hello?
[02:47:45.415 --> 02:47:45.915]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:47:46.256 --> 02:47:47.816]  Oh yeah, this is Ozak here from Dallas Tech.
[02:47:47.856 --> 02:47:54.557]  First of all, I would like to commend you on your information war and the war against the military-industrial complex and the New World Order.
[02:47:54.898 --> 02:47:55.738]  But I had a question.
[02:47:56.218 --> 02:47:58.358]  Aren't you afraid that something may happen to you?
[02:47:58.638 --> 02:48:13.082]  Because basically you're exposing not only the corruption that's going on right now, I mean, the secret societies, how Bush and the rest of these guys are tied into this elite who make policies not only to destroy our sovereignty, but to switch into one world government with
[02:48:13.732 --> 02:48:14.572]  ID causes such.
[02:48:16.133 --> 02:48:20.574]  Oh so that's a really good question and I'd love to have you on longer but I've got to end it here.
[02:48:20.594 --> 02:48:22.455]  I'll come back after the break and answer your question.
[02:48:22.495 --> 02:48:24.836]  It's the most often asked question.
[02:48:25.956 --> 02:48:37.260]  I'll begin by answering it by saying the men at Bunker Hill knew something bad could happen to them when they were fighting what six times their number of cracked British Invincibles as they were known.
[02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:38.720]  Dragoons.
[02:48:40.601 --> 02:48:40.801]  So
[02:48:41.701 --> 02:48:42.282]  I mean, yeah.
[02:48:42.802 --> 02:48:45.105]  Of course something could happen to me.
[02:48:47.067 --> 02:48:49.910]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.170 --> 02:48:50.871]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:50.971 --> 02:48:51.752]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.092 --> 02:48:56.797]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.118 --> 02:49:03.865]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.165 --> 02:49:06.147]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.347 --> 02:49:09.189]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.290 --> 02:49:13.954]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.154 --> 02:49:18.538]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.798 --> 02:49:26.024]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:49:46.371 --> 02:49:47.992]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:48.112 --> 02:49:52.255]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:52.355 --> 02:49:55.237]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:55.317 --> 02:50:02.041]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:02.221 --> 02:50:05.223]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:05.443 --> 02:50:07.825]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:07.965 --> 02:50:12.668]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:12.848 --> 02:50:27.441]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[02:51:51.874 --> 02:51:53.976]  We did find one of the mainstream news articles.
[02:51:53.996 --> 02:51:55.157]  We're looking for the other one right now.
[02:51:55.197 --> 02:51:56.297]  We're going to be posting it as well.
[02:51:56.898 --> 02:52:01.461]  BushLink Company handled security for WTC, Dulles, and United Airlines.
[02:52:02.446 --> 02:52:06.490]  Published Tuesday, July 4th, 2003 by Prince George's Journal.
[02:52:06.650 --> 02:52:10.794]  See, it came out in 2003 because his mother wrote about how he worked on the security.
[02:52:11.434 --> 02:52:20.142]  And then later more on this came out that he was there for a meeting about security that day, and their contract ended on September 11th.
[02:52:20.243 --> 02:52:21.624]  And a lot of that is here in this article.
[02:52:22.505 --> 02:52:26.188]  And they changed the name in 2000, but he was still on the Board of Directors after that.
[02:52:26.769 --> 02:52:28.150]  And it just goes through it all here.
[02:52:30.075 --> 02:52:37.781]  And, uh, it says that Marvin Bush was called by the Prince George's Journal, Mainstream News in Maryland, and would not respond, and the White House is being very secretive.
[02:52:38.561 --> 02:52:48.528]  And headline, BushLink Company handled security for WTC, Dulles United, and he was, uh, very close to the towers, as you heard from his mother, on that fateful day when all this happened.
[02:52:48.948 --> 02:52:55.973]  So, uh, and also, uh, ran security at Dulles, and then directly into, uh, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[02:52:55.993 --> 02:52:57.054]  I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
[02:52:57.615 --> 02:52:58.535]  So, there you go, folks.
[02:53:00.268 --> 02:53:03.009]  The caller brought up the question of why am I still alive.
[02:53:04.789 --> 02:53:07.490]  I get sick of talking about this, but people ask it all the time.
[02:53:07.530 --> 02:53:09.531]  I know it gets boring for regular listeners.
[02:53:10.171 --> 02:53:11.371]  I've been physically attacked.
[02:53:11.431 --> 02:53:12.091]  I've been threatened.
[02:53:12.111 --> 02:53:13.212]  I've had a lot of stuff happen.
[02:53:13.232 --> 02:53:14.552]  I'm not going to get off into it.
[02:53:15.032 --> 02:53:15.832]  I'm in a war.
[02:53:15.932 --> 02:53:16.753]  I know the cost.
[02:53:16.833 --> 02:53:18.153]  I don't care about my safety.
[02:53:19.213 --> 02:53:19.533]  Okay?
[02:53:19.573 --> 02:53:20.614]  I'm not worried about it.
[02:53:21.754 --> 02:53:22.834]  Whatever happens, happens.
[02:53:22.894 --> 02:53:23.835]  It's in God's hands.
[02:53:23.975 --> 02:53:25.155]  I'm fighting tyranny.
[02:53:25.815 --> 02:53:28.756]  I have a responsibility to do that, and I'm going to do that.
[02:53:30.686 --> 02:53:32.667]  Then they say, well why haven't they killed you?
[02:53:33.267 --> 02:53:34.548]  Because there's millions of us.
[02:53:34.668 --> 02:53:35.928]  And because I've already done my work.
[02:53:35.968 --> 02:53:37.349]  I've put my material out.
[02:53:37.369 --> 02:53:38.569]  They don't want to make me a martyr.
[02:53:39.029 --> 02:53:43.651]  What they might try to do is plant drugs on me or demonize me in the media.
[02:53:44.111 --> 02:53:45.572]  That's what I've seen them do to other people.
[02:53:46.332 --> 02:53:49.594]  Or if they can get me to do something stupid, then they'll send out a SWAT team to kill me.
[02:53:50.294 --> 02:53:53.635]  Like they did to Bill Cooper.
[02:53:54.716 --> 02:53:55.316]  So that's it.
[02:53:56.276 --> 02:53:57.877]  I've got a whole bunch of these articles here.
[02:53:58.576 --> 02:53:59.376]  But here's an example.
[02:53:59.436 --> 02:54:01.877]  Rock throwing reported in Santa Ana, California.
[02:54:02.437 --> 02:54:16.020]  The Orange County Register police asked other law enforcement agencies for help this afternoon after a group of 1,500 protesters jammed traffic on Bristol Street near First Street and Edgar Avenue and some started to hurl rocks, plastic bottles, and marbles at officers.
[02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:17.901]  It's starting to take a turn for the worse.
[02:54:17.921 --> 02:54:26.623]  Santa Ana Police Sergeant Lorenzo Carrillo said, and it goes on to talk about, and I've got video now online
[02:54:29.671 --> 02:54:36.416]  Where they show this stuff happening around the country, and they're cussing or yelling or throwing stuff at cops, and the cops just stand there and take it.
[02:54:37.197 --> 02:54:38.198]  Because they've been told to.
[02:54:39.298 --> 02:54:44.923]  And there's been video of them beating whites and blacks up, and this has been happening, and then the media calls it a fight.
[02:54:44.943 --> 02:54:47.545]  You know, they come up and beat somebody down, and, oh, it's a fight!
[02:54:48.005 --> 02:54:52.929]  So next time somebody mugs you, when the cops come, they'll just say, oh, it was just a fight.
[02:54:53.509 --> 02:54:54.650]  No, no, you were attacked.
[02:54:55.651 --> 02:54:57.292]  And, uh, really scary.
[02:54:59.307 --> 02:55:01.028]  Again, the dollar's been devalued.
[02:55:01.208 --> 02:55:03.850]  The globalists are de-industrializing us by design.
[02:55:04.170 --> 02:55:10.275]  Then as the dollar's devalued, it allows foreigners to accelerate the buy-up of the infrastructure of this country.
[02:55:10.776 --> 02:55:11.556]  That's happening.
[02:55:12.017 --> 02:55:15.639]  London Guardian reporting oil may go over $100 a barrel.
[02:55:15.659 --> 02:55:16.780]  They're now predicting that.
[02:55:17.301 --> 02:55:18.762]  Wall Street analysts are warning.
[02:55:20.897 --> 02:55:21.738]  It goes on and on.
[02:55:21.778 --> 02:55:25.441]  The situation with Iran is getting just more and more serious by the millisecond.
[02:55:25.801 --> 02:55:27.102]  And I haven't talked about this.
[02:55:27.162 --> 02:55:28.223]  I meant to talk about this.
[02:55:28.323 --> 02:55:29.824]  Listeners want to talk about this.
[02:55:30.384 --> 02:55:31.906]  The globalists are into the occult.
[02:55:31.926 --> 02:55:33.167]  They believe in numerology.
[02:55:33.627 --> 02:55:34.908]  And now it's in the Denver Post.
[02:55:36.109 --> 02:55:36.689]  666 cents.
[02:55:37.150 --> 02:55:38.371]  Date marked with caution.
[02:55:38.691 --> 02:55:41.373]  While some say June 6th of 2006 is the date of fear.
[02:55:41.833 --> 02:55:44.195]  For its biblical significance, officials see little to dread.
[02:55:44.796 --> 02:55:46.177]  I'll start the show with this tomorrow.
[02:55:47.197 --> 02:55:48.158]  I meant to get to it today.
[02:55:48.699 --> 02:55:50.220]  I meant to get more into al-Zaqqari
[02:55:51.625 --> 02:55:51.886]  U.S.
[02:55:51.906 --> 02:55:57.959]  government protecting him and not letting people kill him because he's CIA and then staging his death over and over again.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:00.143]  That was mainstream news.
[02:56:01.696 --> 02:56:03.077]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
