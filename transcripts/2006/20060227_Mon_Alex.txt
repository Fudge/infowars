[00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:06.310]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:08.051]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.752 --> 00:00:09.873]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.513 --> 00:00:11.314]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:12.975]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:17.319]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:21.903]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.349]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.711]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition, the 27th day of February 2006.
[00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:43.153]  Coming up in the next hour, we have Don Darling, who I've never interviewed before, but is a good friend of mine.
[00:01:02.037 --> 00:01:03.779]  He's a member of Veterans for Peace.
[00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.242]  He was a Navy captain and a Navy diver.
[00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:17.891]  And, of course, one of the ships he captained was a submarine rescue ship, one of the first and most sophisticated, of course, of its time.
[00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:21.534]  And he worked in the Mediterranean and many other areas.
[00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:25.577]  And then he began to discover the New World Order.
[00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:29.581]  He began to discover that our government was run by criminals.
[00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:37.188]  He began to discover that they had taken he and his men and many others many times and used them and lied to them.
[00:01:37.248 --> 00:01:38.469]  And he's an activist.
[00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:40.010]  He's a member of Veterans for Peace.
[00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.951]  He's off tonight.
[00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:47.637]  And so Captain Don Darling will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:48.597 --> 00:01:49.038]  All right.
[00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:53.439]  And then a surprise guest in the third hour of that materializes.
[00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.080]  UAE terminal takeover extends to 21 ports.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.940]  Now we're hearing it extends to 25 ports.
[00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:02.621]  But it is confirmed to be 21 ports.
[00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:08.483]  Now, back last week, we had learned that it was going to be the port of Corpus Christi and Beaumont, that being eight ports.
[00:02:08.803 --> 00:02:11.083]  Corpus Christi is just a massive port.
[00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:12.864]  Very, very important.
[00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:16.905]  Really the gateway to the intercoastal ship channel that runs for over 1,000 plus miles.
[00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:22.616]  And now we learn it's 21 ports.
[00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:28.962]  And I listened to a lot of talk radio this weekend, driving around town doing errands or here in the office working.
[00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:32.044]  And I noticed the neocons have this mantra.
[00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.105]  They won't run security.
[00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.006]  They won't run security.
[00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:34.907]  They won't run security.
[00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:36.268]  It's evil liberal lie.
[00:02:36.368 --> 00:02:37.229]  Evil liberal lie.
[00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:38.249]  Evil Democrats.
[00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.410]  Evil, evil Democrats.
[00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:41.032]  They won't run security.
[00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:41.913]  They won't run security.
[00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:43.214]  The UAE won't do it.
[00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:44.755]  Do port security.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.562]  Dubai Ports World won't run it.
[00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:49.063]  It's a total lie.
[00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:49.764]  Total lie.
[00:02:50.124 --> 00:02:55.729]  No, it's just one of their chief executives is going to be running all security for all the ports.
[00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:56.770]  So, yes, you're right.
[00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.134]  It's much, much worse than you're even trying to spin it.
[00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.332]  So, I've got some more comments on the port situation when we get back.
[00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:07.832]  I'm not going to spend long on it today.
[00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:18.777]  That's all anyone is talking about, and frankly, it's a distraction from most of our roads being handed over to farm corporations, most of our water, most of our power companies.
[00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:20.617]  It's all being handed over.
[00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:26.440]  I mean, literally, the majority of the infrastructure has been and is being handed over right now.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.902]  So, that's the real story, is that our infrastructure is being sold out, not just our jobs.
[00:03:32.363 --> 00:03:39.261]  Not just our morals, not just the fabric of what makes America, it's all being repossessed right now.
[00:03:40.393 --> 00:03:43.294]  A chilling article out of the Associated Press and Newsday.
[00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:47.677]  Officials, smart cameras, armed guards to protect WTC site.
[00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:52.599]  And everything they say in this article is the plan for the entire country.
[00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:53.539]  I've got the documents.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:08.787]  Huge article about civilian inmate labor camps, not from 1996 when the Pentagon declassified it, but the new memorandum, what is it, 50 plus pages, by General Shoemaker, head of the Army, got his feet wet in American blood at Waco.
[00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:09.627]  What a commander.
[00:04:10.214 --> 00:04:18.037]  Well, he loves the New World Order, and they've got quite an announcement for the camps for you and your family.
[00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:20.438]  And finally, it's all over the news.
[00:04:20.538 --> 00:04:22.719]  It's in several mainstream newspapers.
[00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.540]  Are these camps for us?
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.421]  Why is the government building camps?
[00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:35.664]  I've got two mainstream news articles out of the U.S., one out of the Asia Times, and several others about the loving camps.
[00:04:36.727 --> 00:04:37.948]  The loving camps.
[00:04:38.048 --> 00:04:42.090]  Yes, it's just... Because to use them, they've got to start announcing them, you see.
[00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:48.714]  We'll get into the evidence emerging of the mosque bombing, the shine bombing, being a globalist.
[00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:51.716]  Attacks on free speech globally.
[00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:52.856]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:54.137]  Such an important broadcast.
[00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:56.098]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:58.119]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.080]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:09.658]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.680]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.562]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:25.323]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:32.685]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:37.246]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:39.926]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.146 --> 00:05:46.848]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:47.429]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:02.516]  Hello, folks.

[00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:08.447]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:13.669]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:21.894]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.054 --> 00:07:29.098]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:30.519]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:34.062]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:34.122 --> 00:07:36.805]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:07:37.025 --> 00:07:43.851]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:50.555]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:04.211]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:07.654]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:14.500]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.303]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:17.783 --> 00:08:21.146]  Defending this republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:08:23.468 --> 00:08:27.872]  I got an email over the weekend and it said, Alex, I heard you on Coast to Coast AM.
[00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:28.813]  I'm paraphrasing it.
[00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.892]  And I agree with a lot of the things you say, but it seems like you're always bashing Republicans.
[00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.873]  Are you some type of secret Democrat?
[00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:37.454]  Why are you doing this?
[00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:39.415]  Sir, we're not partisan.
[00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:46.519]  Both parties are equally controlled, but the current Bush White House is trying to set up an official dictatorship.
[00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.701]  Congressman Ron Paul has told you this on this broadcast.
[00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:54.623]  We have articles written about and quotes and transcripts of what they've said and audio files.
[00:08:54.904 --> 00:08:57.505]  They're at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com for you.
[00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:02.249]  We have had Cynthia McKinnon, Congresswoman, on in the last month saying that.
[00:09:02.569 --> 00:09:06.538]  Bob Barr saying that, saying clearly we're going into a dictatorship.
[00:09:07.173 --> 00:09:13.074]  We've had Paul Craig Roberts, one of the twin fathers of Reaganomics, extremely conservative, saying that.
[00:09:13.834 --> 00:09:29.018]  We had Ray McGovern on Friday saying that in his 40-plus years in government as an Army officer in Southeast Asia, as an intelligence officer, as a CIA top-level briefing, briefing presidents, that yes, we are in real danger.
[00:09:29.038 --> 00:09:30.978]  They are trying to set up a dictatorship.
[00:09:31.753 --> 00:09:32.854]  Okay, do you understand that?
[00:09:32.914 --> 00:09:33.794]  This isn't a joke.
[00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:34.595]  It isn't a game.
[00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:39.538]  I was the coup 10, 12 years ago talking about this because I saw the federal documents.
[00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:41.380]  I posted the federal documents.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.081]  I made films about the documents.
[00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:49.545]  I went and showed the military with foreign troops openly training to do it here in America and saying it was for America.
[00:09:50.046 --> 00:09:52.828]  All I've done is report on what I know to be the truth.
[00:09:52.848 --> 00:09:54.769]  And let me boil something down for people.
[00:09:56.249 --> 00:09:57.790]  You know, I come off as aggressive.
[00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.590]  I even come off as arrogant sometimes.
[00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.571]  It is not arrogance.
[00:10:00.671 --> 00:10:01.771]  It is that I am angry.
[00:10:01.931 --> 00:10:02.631]  I am threatened.
[00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:03.472]  I am frantic.
[00:10:03.872 --> 00:10:04.672]  I am desperate.
[00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:05.632]  I am focused.
[00:10:06.193 --> 00:10:07.653]  I am extremely serious.
[00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:10.654]  And I am doing the best defense I can.
[00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:12.555]  I am bucking up.
[00:10:12.715 --> 00:10:13.575]  I am bulling up.
[00:10:14.015 --> 00:10:16.316]  I am doing everything I can against the threat.
[00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.617]  It's just that simple.
[00:10:17.857 --> 00:10:24.339]  Just like a firefighter when he runs into a burning house to save a child, gets an adrenaline rush and fires up to get over their fears.
[00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:25.580]  It's that simple.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.002]  And you know, there's different types of people in this world, but you can break them into a few groups.
[00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:32.865]  There's a lot of people that think you get ahead by only caring about yourself.
[00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:38.028]  There's a lot of people that think that you win in life, because the media has told them, by being self-centered.
[00:10:38.309 --> 00:10:43.912]  They could care less about anybody around them, even their own wife, their own husband, their own children, their grandparents.
[00:10:44.973 --> 00:10:53.299]  We've gone from being a nation that took care of their old folks to being a nation where we warehouse them, and not everybody, but warehouse them in these horrible nursing homes and don't even visit them.
[00:10:54.272 --> 00:11:02.909]  We've turned into a nation that doesn't spend the time with their friends and family to make sure they're taken care of and to make sure they're put on the right path in life.
[00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:09.855]  I have an intense drive, an intense... I grieve for this country.
[00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:21.882]  I grieve for families when I see them at the grocery store or walking down the street because they're so happy-go-lucky and enjoying life and so simple-minded and have no idea of the evil growing up all around them.
[00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:25.644]  I have an intense love and a passion for humanity.
[00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:30.648]  I have an instinctive need to fight corruption and evil, and I almost explode.
[00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:31.088]  I almost...
[00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:31.970]  It's that simple.
[00:11:42.158 --> 00:11:58.541]  When I see the individuals who are so self-centered, they're posing, they're preening, all they care about is status, and they've been told by the establishment that if you do these certain things, go along to get along, be greedy, be self-centered, that you'll supposedly get the status.
[00:11:58.821 --> 00:12:02.062]  Then if you get the status, they're the most unhappy people you've ever met.
[00:12:02.442 --> 00:12:07.483]  The happy people I know, the driven people I know, the fulfilled people I know, care about others.
[00:12:07.523 --> 00:12:08.983]  They're committed to service.
[00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:18.128]  And yes, I have an intense, heartfelt feeling in my soul that I was forged for service.
[00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:20.750]  And I'm telling you, we were all forged.
[00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:38.083]  God made us in our mother's wombs for service, to stand up and to be good and to create and to love beauty and to love decency and to have courage and to stand up against evil and ugliness and the twisted activities of the globalists.
[00:12:38.642 --> 00:12:40.803]  Evil is taking control right now.
[00:12:41.103 --> 00:12:43.824]  If you think things are bad now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:12:44.324 --> 00:12:49.286]  All of this is simply a preparation for the New World Order takeover.
[00:12:49.506 --> 00:12:56.089]  And it could happen within a twinkling of an eye when an A-bomb detonates in an American or European city.
[00:12:56.789 --> 00:13:01.211]  All of it has been prepared, and it isn't going to be the Arabs when it happens, I assure you.
[00:13:01.231 --> 00:13:04.832]  All right, let me just try to cover the news as...
[00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:13.848]  The simplest, but at the same time most detailed fashion I can with the time constraints that we have here today.
[00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.990]  Let me just try to go over this as best I can.
[00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:34.525]  The UAE situation with the Dubai ports world, we are now learning, is not 6, it is not 8, it is not 12, it is not 18, it is not even 21.
[00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:47.434]  It is more than 21 port complexes, and of course now we're learning between 10 and 15, no one knows the actual number yet, depending on which paper you read, in Canada.
[00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:56.174]  It is the majority of major port systems in the United States and North America.
[00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:02.220]  To show how long we've been sold out, yes, the British owned these 20-plus ports.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.861]  Let me give you a little tip here.
[00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:14.811]  Even Forbes magazine and Money, in past issues I've read over the years, admit the majority owners aren't Japan, they aren't the Sauds, they aren't the Frenchies, they aren't the Germans.
[00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:21.194]  It is the British royal family and a handful of lords surrounding them.
[00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:23.755]  They own the majority of the country.
[00:14:23.795 --> 00:14:27.497]  So why do we care if UAE is being given these ports?
[00:14:27.597 --> 00:14:28.617]  Frankly, I don't.
[00:14:29.237 --> 00:14:30.058]  It doesn't matter.
[00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:33.339]  The supposed terrorism threat is a red herring.
[00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:38.141]  But I'm against the port transfer because I'm against key infrastructure being sold off.
[00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:41.583]  And I don't like the fact that Snow and others in the administration...
[00:14:42.103 --> 00:14:48.915]  Have made millions of dollars personally and billions of dollars for their companies in these sales.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:15:11.176]  One of these individuals, according to the Associated Press, who has now been nominated and is about to be confirmed to run all of the ports in the country and run security in the ports under the Maritime Administration, is the current number two man in this company, Dubai Ports World.
[00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:17.962]  So when you hear a neocon get on the air and say, don't worry, UAE won't be running the security at these ports,
[00:15:18.582 --> 00:15:19.663]  In a way, that's true.
[00:15:19.723 --> 00:15:21.605]  They won't be running the security at those ports.
[00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:29.271]  Their former executive will be running all the security at over half the major port complexes in the United States.
[00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:38.679]  By that, big, major, dry dock, deep water ports where goods and services are shipped in, where oil field equipment is shipped out, where pipelines for oil and gas come in.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.923]  I mean, there are thousands of little sailboat and motorboat and fishing boat
[00:15:43.752 --> 00:15:44.914]  We're good to go.
[00:15:54.944 --> 00:15:58.407]  So, number one, this deal is criminal.
[00:15:58.487 --> 00:16:10.878]  It is violating all sorts of ethics and federal laws to have people who are getting billions of dollars, tens of millions personally apiece, who are executives of companies in these deals being able to head up the Maritime Administration.
[00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:14.541]  Treasury Secretary Snow being involved in a one-point deal.
[00:16:16.102 --> 00:16:17.282]  $1.15 billion deal.
[00:16:17.882 --> 00:16:24.445]  All of this, and he is the chairman of the government committee that authorized this deal.
[00:16:24.685 --> 00:16:25.285]  You understand?
[00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:31.727]  Snow authorizes the deal when he just made a deal a year and a half ago for $1,150,000,000.
[00:16:31.947 --> 00:16:32.908]  And now it's coming out.
[00:16:32.928 --> 00:16:34.248]  That's only one deal he made.
[00:16:34.268 --> 00:16:35.189]  He made other deals.
[00:16:39.702 --> 00:16:46.906]  And there's a lawsuit by the city of New York and others just trying to find out what other deals were made.
[00:16:46.926 --> 00:16:48.988]  You see, much of this is secret.
[00:16:49.088 --> 00:16:55.451]  All we know now is 21-plus sports, and these suckers are going to be running security.
[00:16:56.952 --> 00:17:01.795]  And in the fake neocon debates, you're going to hear them go, well, I don't like it, but still it's okay.
[00:17:02.976 --> 00:17:08.339]  It runs the gamut from that to, oh, it's wonderful, this is no big deal, it's an evil, calming line.
[00:17:09.432 --> 00:17:10.953]  So it runs that gamut.
[00:17:10.973 --> 00:17:12.695]  But here it is at United Press International.
[00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:15.778]  UAE terminal takeover extends to 21 ports.
[00:17:16.178 --> 00:17:24.025]  United Arab Emirates government-owned company is poised to take over port terminal operations in 21 American ports, far more than the six widely reported.
[00:17:24.245 --> 00:17:27.488]  And they knowingly, when it came out, released that slowly, see?
[00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:30.290]  And you'll be having arguments with neocon followers a month from now.
[00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.692]  They'll go, it's only six.
[00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:33.093]  You'll go, no, it's actually 25.
[00:17:33.213 --> 00:17:35.315]  And they'll go, no, it ain't.
[00:17:36.204 --> 00:17:38.886]  Again, it's more than 21 we're now learning, but that's what this report says, 21.
[00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:44.488]  The Bush administration has approved the takeover of British-owned Pensler and Oriental Steam Navigation Co.
[00:17:44.729 --> 00:17:50.211]  to DP World, a deal set to go forward March 2nd unless Congress intervenes.
[00:17:51.312 --> 00:17:58.255]  And it goes on to list all of these ports and the things that are happening.
[00:17:59.896 --> 00:18:00.016]  It's...
[00:18:02.606 --> 00:18:03.606]  It's just disgusting.
[00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:06.848]  It's totally, totally disgusting that this is happening.
[00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:09.209]  And why is everybody upset about this?
[00:18:09.229 --> 00:18:21.413]  Again, the highways, the water districts, the toll roads, the lakes, the former city and state-owned power companies, they're just being handed over, not even bought.
[00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:27.436]  They'll come pay a few pennies on the dollar, select money to politicians, and the politicians just hand it over.
[00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:33.962]  And it's all an inside deal, a mafioso-style takeover of this country.
[00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:37.145]  The communist Chinese got the Long Beach military base.
[00:18:37.165 --> 00:18:38.566]  They got Freeport and the Bahamas.
[00:18:38.806 --> 00:18:40.127]  They got the Panama Canal.
[00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:52.539]  And, you know, I get on air and I criticize Bill Clinton for doing that, and I criticize Jimmy Carter for doing what he did, and I criticize the Republicans in 2000 for going along with the handover of the Panama Canal.
[00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.652]  You know, they'd stand up and grab and complain about it, but when it got down to brass tacks, they'd authorize it.
[00:18:58.272 --> 00:19:00.013]  It's because both parties are bought off.
[00:19:00.053 --> 00:19:03.014]  So, I want to hear the Democrats criticize Bill Clinton for this.
[00:19:03.335 --> 00:19:04.995]  And I want to hear you criticize George Bush.
[00:19:05.015 --> 00:19:12.399]  Let's actually criticize and be effective here, instead of only picking and choosing what area of the sellout you want to talk about.
[00:19:13.059 --> 00:19:17.361]  Now, when we get back, a bone-chilling article out of the Associated Press.
[00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:19.342]  Officials, smart cameras...
[00:19:20.334 --> 00:19:22.936]  Armed guards to protect WTC site.
[00:19:23.116 --> 00:19:24.858]  Now, I saw Ridge on TV.
[00:19:24.938 --> 00:19:26.098]  I've read the federal documents.
[00:19:26.379 --> 00:19:28.540]  I heard him on C-SPAN talk about it four years ago.
[00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:31.502]  This is going to be nationwide.
[00:19:31.723 --> 00:19:37.567]  What you're going to hear after the break is going to be nationwide unless we stop it.
[00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:40.449]  Nationwide.
[00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.413]  And then we'll get into the detention centers and the mainstream media.
[00:19:46.674 --> 00:19:47.754]  We'll get into...
[00:19:49.329 --> 00:19:55.673]  The Bedlam, the Civil War, that's what it is going on in Iraq right now, and much more.
[00:19:56.474 --> 00:19:57.094]  Stay with us.
[00:19:57.554 --> 00:19:58.295]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.738 --> 00:20:03.458]  Listen up, folks.
[00:20:03.518 --> 00:20:04.719]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:20:04.919 --> 00:20:07.320]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.161]  You heard that right.
[00:20:08.241 --> 00:20:10.723]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:20:10.983 --> 00:20:12.043]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:20:12.183 --> 00:20:13.384]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:20:13.724 --> 00:20:15.105]  Now's the time to fight back.
[00:20:15.305 --> 00:20:17.667]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[00:20:18.007 --> 00:20:18.607]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.254 --> 00:20:40.734]  We're good to go.
[00:21:02.992 --> 00:21:05.213]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:21:05.653 --> 00:21:09.996]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:21:10.276 --> 00:21:16.079]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:20.361]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:21:20.662 --> 00:21:26.305]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:21:26.405 --> 00:21:29.026]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:21:31.127 --> 00:21:34.650]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 amounts.
[00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.431]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:21:37.792 --> 00:21:40.093]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:21:40.474 --> 00:21:44.096]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:21:44.576 --> 00:21:50.781]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:52.182]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:21:52.202 --> 00:21:52.882]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.922 --> 00:21:53.162]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.864 --> 00:22:03.525]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:22:03.545 --> 00:22:06.507]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:30.765]  We're good to go.
[00:22:48.916 --> 00:22:51.678]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:52.639]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:02.185 --> 00:23:04.547]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:23:04.787 --> 00:23:06.829]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:14.034]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:23:14.294 --> 00:23:22.841]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:23:23.181 --> 00:23:27.867]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:23:28.027 --> 00:23:32.071]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[00:23:32.251 --> 00:23:34.694]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[00:23:34.874 --> 00:23:39.219]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:43.103]  All right, welcome back.
[00:24:11.824 --> 00:24:16.296]  This is out of the Associated Press today, and this is what the entire country will be like.
[00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:28.485]  Official federal plans, and I simultaneously have a Boston Globe article about how they're buying the system designed by the British that they use in London for, quote, smart cameras for all of Boston.
[00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:32.267]  See, now the cameras they put up for traffic in your neighborhood for no reason?
[00:24:32.748 --> 00:24:34.629]  Well, again, we saw the documents a decade ago.
[00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:36.270]  Those are to track and trace and control you.
[00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.912]  Now the Pentagon brags to MIT Magazine and other publications about it.
[00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:44.575]  Now they're making the big public announcement, not just the one in trade publications.
[00:24:45.216 --> 00:24:51.706]  Official Smart Cameras Armed Guards to Protect WTC Site by Amy Westfeld.
[00:24:52.561 --> 00:25:02.130]  Someday, at the new and rebuilt World Trade Center site, visitors might submit to an iris scan or analysis of their thumbprint to get into buildings.
[00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.854]  And our children, many public schools are now doing this to get school lunches, get library books.
[00:25:07.174 --> 00:25:09.617]  Parents to pick their children up have to do it all over the country.
[00:25:09.657 --> 00:25:11.438]  It's starting all federally grants.
[00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:13.000]  See, training everyone.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.805]  While smart cameras try to match their faces to a photo database of known terrorists.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:25.941]  Well-paid armed guards would be on patrol while sensors test the air for lethal gases.
[00:25:26.062 --> 00:25:28.122]  Again, so they face scan your face.
[00:25:28.162 --> 00:25:32.323]  It says smart cameras try to match their faces to a photo database.
[00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:34.063]  That's a face scan.
[00:25:35.384 --> 00:25:41.305]  And it says preliminary details of a plan to make the redeveloped 16-acre site a terrorism-proof facility.
[00:25:42.032 --> 00:25:51.396]  As possible, we're provided to the Associated Press this week by former FBI agent James Kallstrom, Governor George Pataki's senior counterterrorism advisor.
[00:25:51.737 --> 00:26:00.661]  Kallstrom and city federal officials are aiming for a standard of security that doesn't yet exist in public places around the nation.
[00:26:01.201 --> 00:26:04.182]  This will be reflective of the times we live in, said Kallstrom.
[00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:07.962]  The consequences of attacking here would have more significance to the terrorists.
[00:26:08.323 --> 00:26:09.983]  It has a lot of symbolism.
[00:26:10.383 --> 00:26:12.724]  It's going to be extremely well protected.
[00:26:13.604 --> 00:26:15.724]  And it goes more into what they'll be doing.
[00:26:15.744 --> 00:26:24.206]  And similar things were done at the Salt Lake City Olympics and then also the Olympics that they just had that just closed up over in Europe.
[00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:31.970]  I remember seeing Ridge four years ago, before he even got authorization, before he was even a cabinet position, just a few months before they funded it.
[00:26:32.711 --> 00:26:34.574]  I watched a two-hour meeting with him with CEOs.
[00:26:34.615 --> 00:26:35.376]  I talk a lot about this.
[00:26:35.416 --> 00:26:36.418]  I've got it on tape somewhere.
[00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:43.580]  And he just said, you'll have an RFID in your ID badge to get into any building over three stories nationwide.
[00:26:44.361 --> 00:26:45.582]  It'll be a worker card.
[00:26:45.642 --> 00:26:46.702]  It'll be a national ID card.
[00:26:46.722 --> 00:26:47.603]  He called it a real ID.
[00:26:47.623 --> 00:26:48.723]  They didn't pass it last year.
[00:26:48.743 --> 00:26:50.984]  It becomes law in 2008, being everyone at the state level.
[00:26:51.605 --> 00:26:53.966]  And everywhere you go, you'll be tracked with this card.
[00:26:53.986 --> 00:26:55.747]  There'll be transponders in your cars.
[00:26:56.667 --> 00:26:57.868]  He just went through it.
[00:26:57.908 --> 00:27:00.830]  And then magically, we see states starting to pass it.
[00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.031]  Texas almost passed it.
[00:27:02.391 --> 00:27:03.812]  We see the feds passing it.
[00:27:03.832 --> 00:27:10.697]  We see it all magically going into place right on time in everyone's face.
[00:27:11.738 --> 00:27:16.681]  So that's the reality of what's going on today.
[00:27:17.362 --> 00:27:19.403]  And that's what's happening here in our country.
[00:27:20.444 --> 00:27:21.905]  And it's horrible.
[00:27:22.765 --> 00:27:23.586]  All over the country.
[00:27:23.646 --> 00:27:26.971]  It's already started in London and a few airports here in the U.S.
[00:27:26.991 --> 00:27:33.500]  They have these radar scanners that send out radio waves that bounce off your body.
[00:27:34.421 --> 00:27:36.704]  And it gives them a complete image.
[00:27:36.744 --> 00:27:38.406]  I mean, down to every pore on your skin.
[00:27:38.426 --> 00:27:39.368]  You're completely naked.
[00:27:40.038 --> 00:27:42.160]  And they record that onto a computer.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:49.224]  And right now at the Boston Airport and four others that we read about that are doing it, they just, oh, you look suspicious.
[00:27:49.244 --> 00:27:51.706]  We're going to wave you through here and make you walk through this.
[00:27:52.106 --> 00:27:55.469]  But in the future, everyone's going to have to go through them.
[00:27:55.489 --> 00:28:00.712]  And I've got the reports right here where they're going to be to get on the bus, to go in the mall.
[00:28:00.953 --> 00:28:02.914]  You'll just have to walk through these.
[00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:23.102]  The best Hollywood example of this, for somebody to get a grip on it who hasn't seen these documents or seen the news articles or photos on our website of this, is in The Running Man, not The Running Man, is in Total Recall where Schwarzenegger's running through the subway and he runs behind this screen and it scans through to his bones and they see the gun in his waist belt.
[00:28:23.843 --> 00:28:24.383]  In his belt?
[00:28:24.684 --> 00:28:29.811]  Well, it doesn't scan down to the bones, though some models will scan beneath the skin.
[00:28:29.831 --> 00:28:38.402]  No, it just simply gives them an image of your body with greater sharpness than the human eye provides.
[00:28:38.442 --> 00:28:39.303]  You go, what does that mean?
[00:28:39.864 --> 00:28:45.128]  Well, the human eye at 10 feet away doesn't pick up pores on someone's skin.
[00:28:45.468 --> 00:28:56.056]  When you look at these photos of these naked men and women that have been released by the government, people who have been scanned by these, and these are the photos they release, you can see everything on them, right down to the pores on their skin.
[00:28:56.116 --> 00:29:02.081]  Now, for things like CBS Nightly News, they released some more blurred photos where you can still see the genitalia.
[00:29:03.101 --> 00:29:05.202]  And details of the breast and the rest of it.
[00:29:05.442 --> 00:29:14.127]  But in photos where these industry companies brag about this technology, you can go look at the equivalent of Playboy magazine clarity.
[00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:19.309]  But again, Playboy magazine doesn't even show, doesn't look through hair.
[00:29:19.889 --> 00:29:22.170]  I mean, folks, it is unbelievable.
[00:29:23.151 --> 00:29:25.192]  And so get ready with your family to walk through.
[00:29:25.252 --> 00:29:29.734]  Okay, we're going to be recorded naked now because we live in a free country but the border stays wide open.
[00:29:31.109 --> 00:29:36.051]  When we get back, I'm going to get into the sectarian violence exploding across Iraq.
[00:29:36.111 --> 00:29:47.235]  Remember Ray McGovern, senior CIA analyst, said that the government is a prime suspect, has a prime motive in this, either Mossad, CIA, Defense Intelligence, or MI6.
[00:29:47.675 --> 00:29:48.295]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:52.457]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.558]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.478 --> 00:29:58.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:11.774]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that include an item called TriVives that allow you to save hundreds of dollars by wearing rather than orally taking vitamins and nutrients.
[00:30:12.294 --> 00:30:20.621]  When you purchase TriVortex technology products, you make possible outstanding GCN programs such as the Power Hour, Alex Jones, Jack Blood, and Greg Szymanski.

[00:31:02.193 --> 00:31:05.217]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:05.558 --> 00:31:14.370]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:19.377]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:19.837 --> 00:31:26.565]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:26.965 --> 00:31:38.739]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:39.219 --> 00:31:43.661]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:46.162]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:48.163 --> 00:31:49.423]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.443 --> 00:31:50.904]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:31:50.924 --> 00:31:51.964]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:01.345 --> 00:32:02.426]  You don't love me anymore.
[00:32:02.766 --> 00:32:04.568]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:32:04.588 --> 00:32:06.049]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:32:06.209 --> 00:32:06.489]  Yes.
[00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:07.650]  You neglect me.
[00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:09.792]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:32:11.634 --> 00:32:12.635]  Use the cheapest gas.
[00:32:12.975 --> 00:32:13.856]  I'm getting sick.
[00:32:14.176 --> 00:32:16.338]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:32:17.399 --> 00:32:17.860]  Wait a minute.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.562]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:32:19.582 --> 00:32:28.392]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:32:28.852 --> 00:32:34.339]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:36.942]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:32:37.082 --> 00:32:41.746]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[00:32:41.966 --> 00:32:43.628]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:32:43.808 --> 00:32:47.131]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[00:32:47.311 --> 00:32:51.675]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:32:51.755 --> 00:32:53.076]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:18.874]  Do you know why you're here, Evie Hammond?
[00:33:18.894 --> 00:33:26.079]  You've been formally charged with conspiracy to commit treason, terrorism and sedition, the penalty for which is death by firing squad.
[00:33:26.299 --> 00:33:30.182]  You have one chance, and only one chance, to save your life.
[00:33:30.582 --> 00:33:36.526]  You must tell us the identity or whereabouts of Codename V. Do you understand what I'm telling you?
[00:33:37.387 --> 00:33:37.647]  Yes.
[00:33:38.127 --> 00:33:39.408]  Are you ready to cooperate?
[00:33:39.428 --> 00:33:39.468]  No.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.221]  There is something terribly wrong with this country.
[00:33:55.521 --> 00:33:56.482]  Excuse me, miss.
[00:33:56.682 --> 00:33:57.302]  I'm sorry.
[00:33:57.342 --> 00:33:58.042]  No, you're not.
[00:33:58.082 --> 00:33:59.242]  But you will be.
[00:33:59.462 --> 00:34:01.803]  The only verdict is vengeance.
[00:34:02.083 --> 00:34:03.564]  The vendetta.
[00:34:03.664 --> 00:34:14.587]  If my own government was responsible for the deaths of a hundred thousand people, would you really want to know?
[00:34:14.607 --> 00:34:17.828]  You're getting back at them for what they did to you.
[00:34:17.868 --> 00:34:19.389]  What was done to me was monstrous.
[00:34:19.529 --> 00:34:20.489]  And they created a monster.
[00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:25.112]  Fear became the ultimate tool of this government.
[00:34:25.292 --> 00:34:28.393]  I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.
[00:34:28.653 --> 00:34:33.375]  I want everyone to remember why they need us!
[00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:35.615]  I wish I wasn't afraid all the time.
[00:34:35.835 --> 00:34:37.796]  People should not be afraid of their government.
[00:34:38.116 --> 00:34:39.957]  The government should be afraid of their people.
[00:34:40.057 --> 00:34:40.577]  It is you.
[00:34:42.117 --> 00:34:45.378]  Several prominent party members have been murdered, Chief Inspector.
[00:34:45.519 --> 00:34:46.979]  This is exactly what he wants.
[00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:47.459]  What?
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.280]  Chaos.
[00:34:57.003 --> 00:34:59.785]  In this mask, there's more than flesh.
[00:34:59.885 --> 00:35:12.634]  There is an idea, Mr. Creepy, and ideas are bulletproof.
[00:35:15.356 --> 00:35:18.738]  Remember, remember the 5th of November.
[00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:27.681]  All right, and that's another one of the trailers for the new movie coming out in about a week or two, V for Vendetta.
[00:35:27.741 --> 00:35:28.522]  Sounds pretty good.
[00:35:28.582 --> 00:35:30.383]  The government's behind the terrorism.
[00:35:30.403 --> 00:35:34.607]  The government wants us to think that we need them, that we need to give up our liberties.
[00:35:35.227 --> 00:35:37.769]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:39.911]  You can't kill them once they're out.
[00:35:40.521 --> 00:35:54.900]  And the idea everybody better get and get quickly if we're going to keep any freedom and save this republic from enemies foreign and domestic is that criminal elements of the government working with international corporations and intelligence agencies are carrying out
[00:35:55.743 --> 00:36:05.766]  Terror attacks systematically across the Western world and Asia and the Middle East to scare us into submission and as a pretext for the global empire.
[00:36:06.226 --> 00:36:13.608]  Now, I'm not going to spend all day on this because I want to take some calls before our next guest, Don Darling, gets in studio with us.
[00:36:13.648 --> 00:36:17.789]  But before we do that, detention centers for who exactly?
[00:36:18.644 --> 00:36:28.955]  And I've got, what, four mainstream news articles here today, two of them out of the United States about detention centers, but I have something much better than that.
[00:36:30.249 --> 00:36:42.238]  I have Civilian Inmate Labor Camp Program, Army Regulation 210-35, the unclassified variant, released a year ago.
[00:36:42.258 --> 00:36:45.861]  And there's so many documents, how can I ever keep track of them all?
[00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:48.983]  The last time any area of this program was declassified...
[00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.991]  It was in 1996.
[00:36:53.151 --> 00:36:55.752]  It had been completely secret.
[00:36:55.952 --> 00:36:57.953]  Never been reported on, never been released.
[00:36:58.033 --> 00:37:08.039]  No Army documents had been brought forward since it was set up in 1987 covertly in a massive national sprawling program.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.802]  Then in 1996, they declassified it.
[00:37:11.902 --> 00:37:17.525]  I have the cover page of that directly from the Army in my documentary book,
[00:37:18.423 --> 00:37:25.609]  9-11 Descent into Tyranny, and we have that original article posted in those documents on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:26.049 --> 00:37:34.375]  Well, I learned that more than a year ago, this was released by the Army itself, and guess who signed it?
[00:37:34.435 --> 00:37:37.598]  Guess who is on the cover page?
[00:37:38.476 --> 00:37:39.297]  Well, that's right.
[00:37:39.398 --> 00:37:52.317]  Peter J. Shoemaker, General United States Army Chief of Staff, and his adjunct, Sandra R. Riley, Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army.
[00:37:53.118 --> 00:38:02.485]  And you can go read the classified portions of this and its addendums and sub-links that is in the hundreds of pages.
[00:38:02.545 --> 00:38:05.047]  The main cover document is 29 pages.
[00:38:05.067 --> 00:38:09.691]  There's another 20-page additional document that is a supplemental.
[00:38:09.991 --> 00:38:11.572]  And then, as I said, countless links.
[00:38:11.712 --> 00:38:13.294]  I didn't count them all up.
[00:38:13.694 --> 00:38:15.876]  And references to other areas of U.S.
[00:38:15.936 --> 00:38:20.079]  code and other Army documents, both classified and unclassified.
[00:38:20.916 --> 00:38:26.558]  And when you read this, in the previous 1990-60 classification, it's very deceptive.
[00:38:26.578 --> 00:38:32.480]  First it says, there are 12 civilian inmate labor camps with American citizens working on them right now.
[00:38:33.041 --> 00:38:35.662]  Then it goes on to list more than 20 others.
[00:38:35.722 --> 00:38:43.645]  It's kind of like, there are six ports being given to UAE, and, well, there are also 15 others.
[00:38:45.342 --> 00:38:46.323]  And then there are five others.
[00:38:46.843 --> 00:38:47.604]  Well, how many are there?
[00:38:47.644 --> 00:38:48.165]  Oh, there are 26.
[00:38:48.445 --> 00:38:49.185]  Well, wait, there's 25.
[00:38:49.225 --> 00:38:50.206]  Well, wait, there's 30.
[00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:51.147]  Well, wait, there's 21.
[00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:56.712]  On and on and on and on and on.
[00:38:57.492 --> 00:38:58.393]  This is what they do.
[00:38:59.394 --> 00:39:00.875]  I'm working with Paul Watson today.
[00:39:00.935 --> 00:39:01.876]  He works so hard.
[00:39:01.916 --> 00:39:05.399]  Together we're going to try to put an article out on this.
[00:39:05.959 --> 00:39:08.862]  But the big lie is that these don't exist.
[00:39:09.648 --> 00:39:10.529]  You can go read.
[00:39:10.889 --> 00:39:11.930]  You can learn about them.
[00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:12.770]  You can see them.
[00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:13.851]  It's all happening.
[00:39:14.312 --> 00:39:15.252]  It's all going on.
[00:39:16.893 --> 00:39:21.357]  And what they do is, in plain view, they demonstrate that all of this is normal and okay.
[00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:23.118]  Now you read the original 1996 document, and it says...
[00:39:26.581 --> 00:39:31.743]  We use only federal prisons on the camps, but we're in negotiations for state prisoners.
[00:39:32.123 --> 00:39:43.087]  Then you read deeper into just the first three-page synopsis or the document summary, and it says, oh, we're actually working with multiple states with state inmates living at our camps.
[00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:47.329]  So these documents are so weird.
[00:39:48.406 --> 00:39:56.170]  And now I have this new Army regulation, 21035, and I learned of it, what, 14 months?
[00:39:56.391 --> 00:39:57.811]  Excuse me, I'm not perfect.
[00:39:58.272 --> 00:40:11.379]  See, there's so many of these, and so we're going to be writing an article about it, and today we're linking to the raw document and the news articles, but we are doing our own analysis of it as soon as this transmission ends today.
[00:40:11.959 --> 00:40:13.400]  Then I have these articles.
[00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.892]  Here's one out of Alternet.
[00:40:16.972 --> 00:40:19.453]  It's an alternative news article, and I'll read some of the mainstream ones.
[00:40:19.894 --> 00:40:23.196]  Bush's Mysterious New Programs by Nat...
[00:40:23.849 --> 00:40:26.430]  Perry, Consortium News, carried by Alternet.
[00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:37.176]  Not that George W. Bush needs much encouragement, but last week, Senator Lindsey Graham suggested to Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez a new target for the administration's domestic operations.
[00:40:37.276 --> 00:40:41.878]  Fifth columnist, supposedly disloyal Americans who sympathize and collaborate with the enemy.
[00:40:42.299 --> 00:40:43.239]  How do they collaborate?
[00:40:43.279 --> 00:40:44.640]  By protesting the war.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.401]  And he openly called for their arrest.
[00:40:46.881 --> 00:40:51.405]  The administration is not only the right, but the duty, in my opinion, to pursue fifth column movements.
[00:40:51.805 --> 00:40:57.731]  Graham, Republican, South Carolina, told Gonzalez during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings February 6th.
[00:40:59.199 --> 00:40:59.399]  Hmm, so...
[00:41:21.574 --> 00:41:28.516]  Senator A. Smiling Gonzalez reported and responded, the President already said we'd be happy to listen to your ideas.
[00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:31.696]  Hmm, Smiling, let's not bring that up here, sweetie.
[00:41:32.417 --> 00:41:35.797]  Same guy who says they can torture people to death as long as they don't call it torture.
[00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:42.099]  And his deputy, John Yoo, another White House counsel, said they can torture small children crushing body parts in front of their parents.
[00:41:43.052 --> 00:41:49.558]  In less paranoid times, Graham's comments might be viewed by many Americans as a Republican trying to have it both ways.
[00:41:49.999 --> 00:42:03.452]  Integrating himself to the administration of his own party, while seeking some credit for Washington centrists for suggesting Congress should have at least a tiny say in how Bush runs the war on terror.
[00:42:03.832 --> 00:42:15.665]  But recent developments suggest that Bush administration may already be contemplating what to do with Americans who are deemed insufficiently loyal or who disseminate information that may be considered helpful to the enemy.
[00:42:15.985 --> 00:42:19.930]  Top US officials have cited the need to change news
[00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:28.478]  And challenge news that undercuts Bush's actions as a key front in defeating the terrorists who are aided by news informers.
[00:42:28.518 --> 00:42:35.944]  That's a quote in the words of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who has said the Internet needs to be targeted and targeted immediately.
[00:42:35.964 --> 00:42:43.992]  Now, it came out two weeks ago that $1.6 billion has been used in the last two and a half years for fake newscasts and paying off reporters.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:59.085]  Why, this weekend I was researching the overthrow of Mosaddegh in 1953 by the CIA MI6 led by Kermit Roosevelt, and there I was reading the declassified communiques and reports to Downing Street and D.C., to the White House.
[00:42:59.425 --> 00:43:02.666]  The Oval Office by Kermit Roosevelt is after Action Report.
[00:43:03.006 --> 00:43:03.526]  Go read it.
[00:43:03.626 --> 00:43:04.487]  Just go read it.
[00:43:04.527 --> 00:43:05.087]  It's online.
[00:43:05.847 --> 00:43:09.551]  And just type in Kermit Roosevelt declassified Mosaic overthrow documents.
[00:43:09.691 --> 00:43:13.755]  There's a whole document section on the New York Times, of all places, about it.
[00:43:14.136 --> 00:43:21.803]  And he talks about, well, we're already paying off a lot of American newspapers and media and have our agents over most major newspapers, but we need to do more.
[00:43:22.384 --> 00:43:28.210]  I mean, go read from 1953 an after-action report about what they can do better.
[00:43:29.887 --> 00:43:31.309]  And of course, what were they doing then?
[00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:37.256]  They were blowing up mosques, bombing religious leaders, machine-gunning crowds, and then blaming Mosaddegh for it.
[00:43:39.058 --> 00:43:48.469]  And you can go to the CIA.gov, and you can go to their website, and you can sit right there, and you can read it all for yourself.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:49.900]  Last week, Morrissey.
[00:44:15.811 --> 00:44:19.313]  The tame, we want to call him rock and roll.
[00:44:19.353 --> 00:44:21.394]  He's kind of like a depressed lounge singer.
[00:44:22.815 --> 00:44:24.936]  I had a girlfriend like Morrissey many years ago.
[00:44:24.956 --> 00:44:27.818]  And the guy has, of course, no criminal record, done nothing wrong.
[00:44:28.258 --> 00:44:29.079]  And it was all over the news.
[00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:29.759]  They're very proud of him.
[00:44:29.779 --> 00:44:34.542]  They want to scare all of us and have a chilling effect, as Ray McGovern agreed with me last Friday.
[00:44:36.023 --> 00:44:40.105]  And he just said this government's completely corrupt and out of control and is the real terrorist.
[00:44:41.076 --> 00:44:42.717]  And so they came and arrested him.
[00:44:42.737 --> 00:44:46.199]  They came and took him in for questioning into the Ministry of Love and Truth.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.801]  And they said, why did you say that?
[00:44:48.821 --> 00:44:49.841]  And he said, because it's true.
[00:44:50.622 --> 00:44:53.864]  And his comment on it, let me just grab his quote here.
[00:44:54.264 --> 00:44:55.945]  I don't belong to any political groups.
[00:44:56.145 --> 00:44:58.687]  I really don't say anything unless I'm asked directly about it.
[00:44:58.967 --> 00:45:00.248]  And I don't even demonstrate in public.
[00:45:00.288 --> 00:45:01.108]  He's apologizing.
[00:45:01.448 --> 00:45:04.510]  My view is that neither England nor America are democratic societies.
[00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.071]  You can't really speak your mind.
[00:45:06.191 --> 00:45:08.793]  And if you do, then you're investigated.
[00:45:10.456 --> 00:45:12.078]  And just go read it.
[00:45:12.299 --> 00:45:14.221]  And the news reports it like it's a good thing.
[00:45:16.143 --> 00:45:20.008]  Of course, they don't come do that to me because they know I won't be intimidated by it and I'll sue them.
[00:45:20.712 --> 00:45:21.753]  Of course, they don't do that.
[00:45:21.813 --> 00:45:22.173]  No, no, no.
[00:45:22.433 --> 00:45:33.438]  They do that to little mothers who go out with five other people and hand out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches down in Houston going, there's toxic waste been dumped on your property at Halliburton.
[00:45:33.478 --> 00:45:34.258]  It's toxic.
[00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.319]  They're just there protesting the environment.
[00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:37.780]  Protesting for the environment.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.941]  Oh, the Pentagon's out watching you.
[00:45:40.161 --> 00:45:42.302]  And the Pentagon releases the fact they're watching you.
[00:45:42.582 --> 00:45:46.604]  Trying to scare these little housewives out there with their kids and baby strollers.
[00:45:47.259 --> 00:45:53.849]  See, it's an attempt by criminals, by this mafia, to intimidate us.
[00:45:56.312 --> 00:45:57.374]  To back us off.
[00:45:59.417 --> 00:46:00.639]  To make us shut up.
[00:46:01.883 --> 00:46:03.744]  To make us go along with what they're doing.
[00:46:03.764 --> 00:46:10.427]  I know there's a lot of little, afraid men and women in their little cubicles right now trying to manage all of this.
[00:46:10.828 --> 00:46:13.009]  And deep down, you're scared of this system.
[00:46:13.029 --> 00:46:14.509]  You make excuses to yourself.
[00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:18.291]  You go drink every night or whatever you do to try to forget about what you're a part of.
[00:46:18.591 --> 00:46:20.913]  But deep down, you know you're involved in evil.
[00:46:23.414 --> 00:46:25.975]  Deep down, you know what you're doing is wrong.
[00:46:28.276 --> 00:46:31.478]  Deep down, you know that the New World Order...
[00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:33.799]  We're good to go.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:35.621]  We're good to go.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:07.743]  Just coming out and going, wait a minute, Halliburton's going to run camps for illegal aliens and American citizens during emergencies?
[00:47:08.063 --> 00:47:10.724]  Hey, wait a minute, there's government documents.
[00:47:10.744 --> 00:47:13.526]  Wait a minute, Bush is saying he wants to get rid of posse commentatus.
[00:47:13.926 --> 00:47:19.148]  Wait a minute, the government's saying that they may have to set aside the Constitution for a military form of government.
[00:47:19.988 --> 00:47:25.431]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to, I believe it's James in Maryland.
[00:47:25.451 --> 00:47:26.091]  James, go ahead.
[00:47:27.071 --> 00:47:33.835]  Yes, I was wondering if you had heard anything more about Bill Clinton replacing Kofi Annan.
[00:47:34.615 --> 00:47:35.656]  And that's all I had.
[00:47:35.976 --> 00:47:36.557]  Thank you, sir.
[00:47:36.717 --> 00:47:45.702]  Well, memory serves, it's been in six mainstream newspapers, including three of them being U.S., and it was also on World Net Daily.
[00:47:45.722 --> 00:47:47.163]  I don't count that as a mainstream newspaper.
[00:47:48.241 --> 00:47:54.064]  And it was in an Italian newspaper and a British newspaper over the last four years.
[00:47:54.565 --> 00:48:01.989]  We have a little archive on prisonplanet.com concerning that, and it says of the G8, they've lined up seven.
[00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:07.052]  The only country that hasn't agreed to it, I mean, they're actually officially lining it up, is the United States.
[00:48:08.084 --> 00:48:12.066]  And they have to change a rule, but they're talking about making that rule change.
[00:48:12.527 --> 00:48:17.850]  And it's the Security Council that does that, or the Five Nations and then the G8 that vote together to do that.
[00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:22.913]  So they could do it and, yeah, end up with Hillary, the war honk, the gun grabber.
[00:48:23.713 --> 00:48:28.296]  And as President and Clinton, as the head of the UN, wouldn't that be special?
[00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:35.180]  Again, it's like five days before it was in mainstream news about the UAE.
[00:48:36.315 --> 00:48:40.758]  I got on air and covered some of the watchdog groups that were reporting on federal filings.
[00:48:41.138 --> 00:48:43.600]  I linked through to the federal filings and I read it on air.
[00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:46.262]  And people didn't believe it.
[00:48:46.502 --> 00:48:49.424]  I was accused, in emails and on air, of making it up.
[00:48:50.225 --> 00:48:50.705]  Okay, fine.
[00:48:51.165 --> 00:48:51.946]  Whatever makes you happy.
[00:48:52.426 --> 00:48:54.127]  And I'm not saying you were doing that, sir.
[00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:57.269]  I just, every time I mention this Clinton thing, I get emails going, it isn't true.
[00:48:57.289 --> 00:48:58.690]  Well, just learn how to use a search engine.
[00:48:59.331 --> 00:49:02.133]  Because it is very serious.
[00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:02.413]  And...
[00:49:04.334 --> 00:49:06.436]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next here?
[00:49:10.639 --> 00:49:11.740]  I believe you said Barrett.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.801]  Your mic cuts out every time you talk to me, so I couldn't hear it.
[00:49:14.502 --> 00:49:15.422]  Barrett in Texas.
[00:49:15.442 --> 00:49:15.723]  Go ahead.
[00:49:15.743 --> 00:49:16.243]  You're on the air.
[00:49:16.783 --> 00:49:16.984]  Oh, hey.
[00:49:17.004 --> 00:49:20.126]  It's an honor to talk to you, Alex.
[00:49:20.266 --> 00:49:27.791]  I think you were spot on, man, when you were talking about earlier about this fake neocon debate around this Dubai port deal.
[00:49:28.292 --> 00:49:32.675]  Because these are all essentially multinational corporations, and they're not attached to any country.
[00:49:33.306 --> 00:49:41.510]  So they're going to argue, and a lot of the popular support base for Bush has been saying that this is bad for our national security, and they've been kind of turning tail on Bush.
[00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:51.054]  But the fact of the matter is that all these corporations are essentially self-serving, and they're just going to outsource whatever product it is they produce to other countries
[00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.171]  Well, it was already British, and it wasn't six.
[00:49:54.311 --> 00:49:55.231]  It's now 21-plus ports.
[00:49:55.271 --> 00:49:56.051]  They knew that.
[00:49:56.091 --> 00:49:57.072]  The story that's being missed...
[00:50:11.216 --> 00:50:11.536]  I think so.
[00:50:38.155 --> 00:50:38.755]  Right, yeah.
[00:50:39.115 --> 00:50:44.577]  Well, I just also wanted to thank you, man, for not, like, succumbing to an element in the movement.
[00:50:44.737 --> 00:50:49.959]  And, you know, I'd just like to thank you for not balkanizing us on racial, ethnic, or religious lines, man.
[00:50:50.279 --> 00:50:52.820]  I think you're right on, dude.
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:54.001]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:50:54.021 --> 00:50:54.621]  God bless you.
[00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:55.921]  Hey, we're all in this together.
[00:50:55.941 --> 00:50:57.562]  We all hang together or hang separate.
[00:50:57.842 --> 00:50:58.862]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:05.613]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.873 --> 00:51:06.573]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:06.673 --> 00:51:07.454]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.794 --> 00:51:12.477]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.817 --> 00:51:19.561]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:21.863]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.063 --> 00:51:24.906]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.006 --> 00:51:29.670]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:34.274]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.514 --> 00:51:41.741]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.001 --> 00:51:44.423]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:54:02.476 --> 00:54:07.618]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.299 --> 00:54:10.640]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:29.450]  By the way, in my first documentary film that I produced, America Destroyed by Design, we didn't just go show the handover of the Panama Canal and, of course, the Long Beach Naval Base to the CHICOMs.
[00:54:30.436 --> 00:54:45.640]  We also played clips from the 1986 Iran-Contra hearings, where Congressman Jack Brooks from Texas goes to Oliver North, hey, what about this plan, of course in the name of dealing with illegal aliens, even then that was the plan.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.580]  We'll build camps, say it's for illegal aliens, and then put political dissidents in it.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:56.222]  And he says, what's this plan about putting political dissidents in camps here in America that I saw in Miami papers?
[00:54:56.502 --> 00:54:57.682]  We ought to get that clip and play it.
[00:54:58.243 --> 00:55:04.465]  And the committee chairman, Inouye, who's still up there, Brooks is dead now, says we cannot talk about that now.
[00:55:04.505 --> 00:55:07.125]  We'll talk about that if you'd like in executive session.
[00:55:07.165 --> 00:55:11.287]  A lot of that that was later declassified was Operation Rex 84.
[00:55:12.307 --> 00:55:21.230]  So now they're telling us, oh, we're building all these camps for illegal aliens, and then they're saying, oh, you know, because most Americans want to do something about the illegal aliens, but that's just the surface, and they say, oh.
[00:55:22.603 --> 00:55:23.644]  Even in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:55:24.325 --> 00:55:28.409]  And it's going to be during crises for American citizens.
[00:55:28.469 --> 00:55:29.931]  We've got to do this.
[00:55:29.951 --> 00:55:37.118]  And then we have this senator last week, we just read the quotes, last segment, coming out and saying, we need to do something about these war protesters.
[00:55:37.158 --> 00:55:38.219]  They're really fifth columns.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.842]  Folks, I've heard Michael Weir, real name, is...
[00:55:41.983 --> 00:55:43.224]  The stage name is Savage?
[00:55:43.604 --> 00:55:46.747]  I've heard him go, you just wait, you scumbag commies.
[00:55:47.147 --> 00:55:49.809]  When there's another attack, it's going to be your fault.
[00:55:50.049 --> 00:55:51.771]  And then you're all going in camps.
[00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:55.253]  If you disagree with this government or protest, you're hating Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:55.473 --> 00:55:58.496]  And then we need to have the sedition laws put back in place.
[00:55:58.676 --> 00:55:59.957]  And then you're going to go to a camp.
[00:56:00.177 --> 00:56:03.580]  And I shouldn't have to pay for you eating in that camp, you fat slobs.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.941]  So you're going to have to work.
[00:56:05.281 --> 00:56:08.003]  And he goes, I've already heard about it from good sources.
[00:56:08.263 --> 00:56:09.084]  You just wait.
[00:56:09.384 --> 00:56:10.045]  We're good to go.
[00:56:26.065 --> 00:56:31.950]  Saying the exact same thing, coming out and saying, you know, we need to start arresting these people, Attorney General.
[00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:36.873]  The Attorney General, we'll talk about that privately later, sir.
[00:56:37.034 --> 00:56:38.795]  So I'm not trying to scare people.
[00:56:39.115 --> 00:56:43.358]  When they were arresting rock stars who criticized Bush and going, why did you criticize him?
[00:56:43.819 --> 00:56:51.845]  They just suspended the mayor of London for a full month for calling a newspaper's tactics Nazi-like.
[00:56:53.052 --> 00:57:02.754]  I've got articles here where films in Germany critical of the war, the government's openly disgusting, not letting them show it, and it says we're sending secret police to the viewings.
[00:57:03.494 --> 00:57:05.795]  This is an attempted intimidation.
[00:57:06.595 --> 00:57:14.797]  And if we give in to it, like the Germans did, if we give in to it like the Russians did, if we give in to it like the Cubans did, it is over in this country.
[00:57:15.496 --> 00:57:27.847]  When we get back, a good friend of mine, never interviewed him, but watched his TV show many times, he's Don Darling, and he's just a wonderful individual, and of course worked in the Navy, and that's an interesting story, so he'll be smiling at me.
[00:57:28.948 --> 00:57:34.373]  He'll be joining us coming up for the next hour, and then one of his colleagues, also involved with Veterans for Peace,
[00:57:35.053 --> 00:57:46.579]  is scheduled to be joining us coming up in the third hour, and we'll cover a lot of news, get his takes on that, talk about what he experienced in the Navy, what he calls the mapmakers.
[00:57:47.579 --> 00:57:48.800]  I call it mapmakers of the mind.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.181]  He calls it something a little bit different.
[00:57:50.481 --> 00:57:54.203]  So that's coming up after this 70-second break here in about 45 seconds.
[00:57:56.081 --> 00:57:59.382]  Before I end this hour, if you want to support us, that's number two.
[00:57:59.602 --> 00:58:02.563]  Number one, they're powerful films, powerful books.
[00:58:02.643 --> 00:58:03.983]  Neocon, Neocon again.
[00:58:04.003 --> 00:58:04.983]  We're now carrying that.
[00:58:05.683 --> 00:58:07.504]  Jim Tucker's Bilderberg Diary.
[00:58:07.524 --> 00:58:09.884]  I was just rereading that this weekend on the exercise bike.
[00:58:10.245 --> 00:58:10.685]  Amazing.
[00:58:10.705 --> 00:58:11.405]  We're carrying that.
[00:58:11.665 --> 00:58:15.946]  My new film, The Order of Death, or my classic film that came out last year, Martial Law.
[00:58:16.406 --> 00:58:17.507]  Big discounts on them.
[00:58:17.547 --> 00:58:18.827]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:22.550]  Shop the secure online shopping cart at the video and bookstore.

[00:58:30.054 --> 00:58:32.615]  We're going to videotape this interview, put it up there for members.
[00:58:33.435 --> 00:58:36.057]  All my films, so much more at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:36.257 --> 00:58:36.897]  So check it out.
[00:58:36.977 --> 00:58:37.798]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:46.208]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.913 --> 00:59:02.098]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.739 --> 00:59:03.560]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:05.242]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.902 --> 00:59:09.627]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.067 --> 00:59:14.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.401 --> 00:59:19.022]  We're now into the second hour.
[00:59:19.062 --> 00:59:25.106]  In the last hour, we got into all these mainstream media reports with headlines like detention camps for who, exactly?
[00:59:25.546 --> 00:59:30.969]  We talked about the civilian inmate labor camp program, new army document, just declassified.
[00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:33.351]  We'll get more into the port situation.
[00:59:33.371 --> 00:59:34.512]  We'll take your calls.
[00:59:35.332 --> 00:59:46.019]  The exploding pandemonium in Bedlam going on in Iraq right now and the very suspicious circumstances surrounding the bombing of that particular shrine.
[00:59:46.759 --> 01:00:01.844]  We had former CIA high-level analyst Ray McGovern on last Friday saying that the evidence is pointing towards Western government's involvement in that, and we have an article with his quotes up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:00:02.844 --> 01:00:07.106]  Our guest for this hour, and perhaps a little bit into the next hour if you can stay with us,
[01:00:07.774 --> 01:00:09.316]  He's a good friend of mine, and I've known him for years.
[01:00:09.336 --> 01:00:13.662]  I've had dinner with him, watched his TV show countless times, so I feel like I know him better than I even do.
[01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:20.591]  And he's Don Darling, and he was the commander of, of course, a submarine rescue ship, I believe the Skylark.
[01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:25.437]  And he joins us here in studio because he's a member of Veterans for Peace.
[01:00:25.837 --> 01:00:38.865]  In the last five, six years, he's really gotten involved, having a lot of guests in from around the world in his TV show, and talking about the war, talking about what's happening in our country, talking about the deceptive activities of our government.
[01:00:39.085 --> 01:00:41.187]  And so he'll be joining us to talk about a host of issues.
[01:00:41.567 --> 01:00:42.748]  Don, it's great to have you with us.
[01:00:43.388 --> 01:00:44.329]  Good to be here, Alex.
[01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:46.530]  I'm pleased to have the opportunity.
[01:00:47.971 --> 01:00:51.692]  For those who just joined us, tell us a little bit about yourself because I always see you on TV.
[01:00:51.712 --> 01:00:53.013]  You never talk about yourself.
[01:00:53.313 --> 01:01:00.475]  I want to start out in this segment and a little bit in the next talking about Don Darling and just the process in your life of awakening.
[01:01:00.715 --> 01:01:05.457]  So let's go back to getting into the Navy, why you got in, what you thought you were fighting.
[01:01:05.497 --> 01:01:06.997]  You were a Navy diver as well.
[01:01:07.598 --> 01:01:08.158]  What developed?
[01:01:09.398 --> 01:01:11.899]  Well, I'd like to go back a little further.
[01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:13.099]  I was born in 1930.
[01:01:15.379 --> 01:01:27.526]  During the first part of the Depression, I mean, seven months after the stock market crashed in 1929, my parents were 16 years old.
[01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:30.348]  They were just 17 when I was born.
[01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:33.530]  My grandfather was superintendent of the county poor farm.
[01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:37.372]  That's where my folks found employment with my mother's father.
[01:01:38.032 --> 01:01:42.215]  My dad was a hired man and my mother was a hired girl at the county poor farm.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.841]  And I was the baby there.
[01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:46.021]  I lived there until I was eight years old.
[01:01:46.061 --> 01:01:54.085]  So I developed a compassion for poor people, disadvantaged people, people who had fallen into poverty or into difficulty.
[01:01:54.665 --> 01:01:56.365]  What we see in our country a lot today.
[01:01:57.186 --> 01:01:58.606]  Well, I went on from there.
[01:01:58.786 --> 01:02:07.090]  And anyway, when I was 17, I had been kind of discontent because I saw that the playing field wasn't level.
[01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.771]  So I joined the Navy.
[01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:10.251]  And
[01:02:11.503 --> 01:02:21.590]  I went to San Diego, was tested there, informed to make good scores on this test, because it'll make a big difference in your Navy career.
[01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:22.090]  I did.
[01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:34.618]  I was sent to electronic school, went up through the ranks, made chief petty officer on my first submarine, after I served on two aircraft carriers, and then went into the nuclear submarine program.
[01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:38.020]  From there, I was promoted out of the nuclear submarine program,
[01:02:38.507 --> 01:02:38.967]  We're good to go.
[01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:39.868]  We're good to go.
[01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:05.153]  Navigator of a Polaris submarine.
[01:03:05.233 --> 01:03:10.780]  It's my job to fix a position exactly where we are, because we knew exactly where the targets were.
[01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:12.583]  And that's how that all worked.
[01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.425]  Mutual assured destruction.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:21.705]  Well, we could have you on for a full hour just about becoming a Navy diver and then commanding a rescue ship for submarines.
[01:03:21.725 --> 01:03:23.486]  And I want to spend some time about that.
[01:03:23.506 --> 01:03:29.069]  And, you know, you're in there, you're fighting the commies, you're fighting for America, and then, you know, that process of awakening.
[01:03:29.110 --> 01:03:37.055]  Because I've one time seen you on TV talk about yourself personally, and I think that's because there's so many good people who make all these sacrifices, jump through all these hoops,
[01:03:37.475 --> 01:03:39.097]  And then they say, hey, I'm part of this government.
[01:03:39.137 --> 01:03:41.400]  This government can't be bad because I'm not bad.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:46.707]  We're going to come back with Don Darling and it's going to be a very interesting hour so be sure and stay with us, folks.
[01:03:53.419 --> 01:03:54.921]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.101 --> 01:03:58.204]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.344 --> 01:04:02.247]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.287 --> 01:04:06.532]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.872 --> 01:04:10.635]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.735 --> 01:04:12.657]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.777 --> 01:04:16.121]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:17.222]  The medical bills.
[01:04:18.822 --> 01:04:20.843]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:24.024]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:04:24.204 --> 01:04:27.085]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.566 --> 01:04:33.668]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:34.729]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.684 --> 01:05:02.752]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:02.992 --> 01:05:14.242]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:20.287]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.507 --> 01:05:21.187]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.735 --> 01:05:45.135]  803-4438.
[01:05:45.155 --> 01:05:50.841]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:56.345]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:05:56.546 --> 01:05:59.949]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:06:00.129 --> 01:06:03.572]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:06:03.863 --> 01:06:07.104]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:06:07.124 --> 01:06:12.587]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:06:12.627 --> 01:06:22.251]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:23.692]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:06:23.712 --> 01:06:29.174]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:06:29.674 --> 01:06:34.096]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:06:34.116 --> 01:06:35.536]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:06:35.716 --> 01:06:39.538]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:06:39.638 --> 01:06:40.458]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:58.590]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.271 --> 01:07:00.311]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.032 --> 01:07:02.153]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.793 --> 01:07:03.613]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.374 --> 01:07:05.234]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.935 --> 01:07:09.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.117 --> 01:07:14.239]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.521 --> 01:07:23.665]  All right, coming up, we're going to get into the Iraq War, the upcoming attack on Iran, which they're kind of backing off a little bit now.
[01:07:24.403 --> 01:07:26.985]  Just a few weeks ago, it was every Democrat and Republican you can imagine.
[01:07:27.005 --> 01:07:27.546]  We've got to attack.
[01:07:27.566 --> 01:07:28.106]  We've got to hit them.
[01:07:28.126 --> 01:07:29.487]  They're going to nuke us any minute.
[01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:31.329]  They've removed the seals, the nukes, the nukes.
[01:07:31.429 --> 01:07:38.074]  And they don't seem to mention it's a peaceful reactor that's already been completely inspected with video cameras in it, and it's their right to do it.
[01:07:39.967 --> 01:07:40.727]  We're good to go.
[01:07:40.768 --> 01:07:40.948]  I think?
[01:07:40.988 --> 01:07:41.808]  We're good to go.
[01:07:41.828 --> 01:07:41.988]  I think?
[01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.738]  And I said, why?
[01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:12.301]  He goes, well, we caught those Brits, SAS, Special Air Services, dressed up with fake beards, driving around with little truck bombs and shooting Iraqi policemen, our people, in Basra.
[01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:12.762]  Why?
[01:08:13.062 --> 01:08:14.162]  Pentagon's own plan.
[01:08:14.182 --> 01:08:16.083]  There's multiple plans, P2OG and others.
[01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:18.384]  There's an 83 Israeli plan they said they want.
[01:08:18.764 --> 01:08:19.624]  Balkanization.
[01:08:19.945 --> 01:08:25.207]  Do the defense contractors make more money if they're in Iraq a year, two years, or if they're there 20 years, 30 years?
[01:08:26.287 --> 01:08:28.049]  You see, order out of chaos.
[01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:30.390]  But the average person just can't get that.
[01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:31.892]  They can't begin to understand that.
[01:08:32.092 --> 01:08:36.575]  You know, why can we beat the Vietnamese in six weeks, hands down, but we're not allowed to for ten years?
[01:08:36.836 --> 01:08:39.197]  It's about the profit, the war machine.
[01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:40.739]  It's hard to get a war started.
[01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:42.420]  Once they get one started, they don't want to stop it.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.822]  In fact, they don't just want to stop the Iraq War.
[01:08:45.062 --> 01:08:49.866]  They want to expand it into Iran and Syria and 61 other countries, according to who?
[01:08:50.186 --> 01:08:53.389]  Not according to Richard Clarke, or not according to O'Neill, not according to...
[01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:56.332]  No, according to the PNAC documents.
[01:08:56.592 --> 01:08:57.333]  Who wrote those?
[01:08:57.713 --> 01:09:00.356]  Dick Cheney and 24 other neocons.
[01:09:00.396 --> 01:09:03.739]  Now, I know a lot of stations just joined us, so we're going to recap.
[01:09:04.767 --> 01:09:05.167]  We're good to go.
[01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:37.463]  But I've been watching Don for years, and I know he's been in the Navy, but I didn't know that he was a commander of a submarine rescue ship, a Navy diver.
[01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:40.528]  I didn't know how he awoke.
[01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:45.255]  This is an incredibly patriotic individual, and so many people who are in the military.
[01:09:45.815 --> 01:09:49.418]  So many people who are high level, low level, whatever, they email me and go, Alex, we know you're good.
[01:09:49.458 --> 01:09:52.800]  You were good when you were bashing Bill Clinton, but why are you bashing Bush now?
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.840]  He cares about us.
[01:09:54.121 --> 01:09:55.722]  We've got to get these evil Arabs.
[01:09:55.782 --> 01:10:00.665]  And you know, I'm in the government, so don't say the government's evil because you're saying I'm evil.
[01:10:01.306 --> 01:10:06.049]  Folks, a real man doesn't just go out and beat people up or climb obstacles.
[01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:11.072]  A real man or woman has to be able to face evil and have moral courage.
[01:10:11.112 --> 01:10:16.756]  In fact, major psychological studies have shown against peer pressure, it takes more courage
[01:10:17.516 --> 01:10:18.877]  We're good to go.
[01:10:40.826 --> 01:10:41.866]  He's such a good man.
[01:10:42.166 --> 01:10:43.687]  He's done so much wonderful work.
[01:10:43.827 --> 01:10:48.648]  And he's a patriot for this country today as he was years ago.
[01:10:49.128 --> 01:10:50.969]  So, Mr. Darling, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:10:51.009 --> 01:11:00.131]  And just quickly, rundown, you were kind of born into the Grapes of Wrath type situation out at one of the poor farms with your parents working there.
[01:11:00.932 --> 01:11:05.953]  You then went and got into the Navy, scored well, was in nuclear submarines and diesel subs.
[01:11:06.733 --> 01:11:08.714]  Recapping, we've gotten up to that point.
[01:11:08.754 --> 01:11:09.414]  Please continue.
[01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:15.765]  Well, I was promoted out of the nuclear program to officer candidate school.
[01:11:15.845 --> 01:11:32.831]  I became a 90-day wonder from charm school, and then went back to submarines as an officer, and then finally to a nuclear submarine, a Polaris submarine, engaged in mutually assured destruction.
[01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:38.893]  But I started seeing that a lot of the stuff that we were doing, I didn't
[01:11:39.736 --> 01:11:41.497]  I did not see the sense of it.
[01:11:41.537 --> 01:11:43.158]  It just didn't feel right to me.
[01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:47.961]  Well, I went on from having command of a submarine rescue ship.
[01:11:48.061 --> 01:11:53.405]  I served on three submarines and did 13 special operations in submarines.
[01:11:55.446 --> 01:12:01.350]  Then commanding officer of the submarine rescue ship Skylark, which by the way,
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:10.163]  Before I had command of it, it was with the USS Thrasher, when the Thrasher made her last dive, the one from which she did not surface.
[01:12:12.504 --> 01:12:21.768]  My last tour of duty in the Navy was in Washington, D.C., and I saw things there that I can't even talk about now that turned me off.
[01:12:22.761 --> 01:12:36.510]  It is a very difficult thing to be a red, white, and blue commissioned officer or enlisted person in the military forces of the United States and to start to see that something isn't right.
[01:12:37.151 --> 01:12:42.334]  That there's a fine line between patriotism and fascism.
[01:12:44.521 --> 01:13:04.446]  It is so difficult to make this transition because we are so convinced of the virtuosity and the righteousness of the United States of America and I understand when I speak out as I am now why people get offended because they think I'm talking to them directly and in a way I am.
[01:13:05.446 --> 01:13:11.868]  When I was ready to deliver nuclear weapons on Russian Soviet Union cities
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.340]  Who hired me?
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.281]  It was you folks.
[01:13:16.822 --> 01:13:21.503]  It was the American people who paid my way to do that.
[01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:26.285]  Sure, I worked for Carter.
[01:13:26.425 --> 01:13:28.066]  No, it was before Carter.
[01:13:28.126 --> 01:13:33.167]  Johnson and those presidents.
[01:13:33.768 --> 01:13:37.229]  I'm 75 years old, so if I pause once in a while,
[01:13:38.236 --> 01:13:39.617]  I deserve to.
[01:13:39.717 --> 01:13:40.317]  You're doing great.
[01:13:40.337 --> 01:13:41.058]  What are you talking about?
[01:13:41.798 --> 01:13:42.979]  Well, anyhow.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:48.862]  So I got out of the Navy and I became a chiropractor.
[01:13:49.582 --> 01:13:53.724]  But I continued to follow what was going on in the world.
[01:13:54.525 --> 01:14:04.590]  And I didn't speak out very much, but I saw a Navy Admiral, Admiral Gene LaRock, who founded the Center for Defense Information in Washington.
[01:14:05.547 --> 01:14:20.119]  Speaking out, and finally I had a chance to talk to him, and he gave me the courage to speak out against what I see as bad policies, domestic and foreign.
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:29.066]  Well, we've had a lot of admirals and captains and some of the folks involved with the USS Liberty here on the broadcast.
[01:14:29.106 --> 01:14:37.636]  Before you leave us today, don't let me forget to bring up the USS Liberty because you've also exposed that and worked on that and aired one of the documentaries here locally, Mr. Darling.
[01:14:38.176 --> 01:14:41.240]  But continuing, Don, I don't want to just glaze over this.
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:41.941]  Let's talk about...
[01:14:42.661 --> 01:14:55.485]  Just personally, because it's interesting, let's talk about how old you were when you had to go back and become a certified Navy diver, which isn't easy, and then what some of your work on the submarine rescue ship as its commander was like.
[01:14:56.845 --> 01:14:59.446]  Okay, well, I was 37 years old.
[01:14:59.506 --> 01:15:02.287]  I became a grandfather while I was in diving school.
[01:15:03.147 --> 01:15:11.530]  I had to go to diving school and become a Navy diving officer, helium oxygen, air.
[01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.970]  I'd been to
[01:15:12.877 --> 01:15:17.999]  320 feet on helium oxygen, 285 feet on air.
[01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:25.681]  I know how it is to be there, and did it at an older age, so I was in good shape then.
[01:15:26.161 --> 01:15:35.904]  I'm not in good shape now, because later on I was exposed to radiation, and overexposed, and had a daughter born with a birth defect.
[01:15:36.571 --> 01:15:38.692]  And when I went in the nuclear submarine program.
[01:15:39.092 --> 01:15:40.493]  But back to the Skylark.
[01:15:41.153 --> 01:15:48.356]  Some of the things we did, we were deployed in the Mediterranean when the French submarine Eurydice went down.
[01:15:49.777 --> 01:15:59.461]  We got underway and went through the Straits of Gibraltar to go see if we could help those guys, only to learn that they were in water far too deep for our capability to get to.
[01:16:00.642 --> 01:16:05.824]  There were other incidents where we were involved in potential submarine losses.
[01:16:06.488 --> 01:16:18.073]  A submissive program once where we were able to find the submarine that had not come in with its daily check report and to get it to surface and validate that it was okay.
[01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:23.895]  A lot of exciting things like that, and I really enjoyed having command of a Navy ship.
[01:16:24.015 --> 01:16:25.596]  It is a unique opportunity.
[01:16:26.036 --> 01:16:30.038]  Were you in the seas or near the Med when the USS Liberty happened in 1967?
[01:16:30.078 --> 01:16:30.298]  No, no, no.
[01:16:30.318 --> 01:16:30.558]  I came...
[01:16:35.742 --> 01:16:47.253]  The Mediterranean deployment on the Skylark was in 1970, and that was three years after the Liberty incident.
[01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:53.899]  When I bring that up later, because I want to talk about politics and what's happening currently, before we do that, I want to get the view of what you guys heard at the time.
[01:16:53.939 --> 01:16:55.200]  Now we know exactly what happened.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:01.546]  In hindsight, and people have spoken out, including admirals who took the phone call from LBJ saying, I want that GD boat on the bottom.
[01:17:02.006 --> 01:17:02.427]  We're good to go.
[01:17:02.447 --> 01:17:02.887]  We're good to go.
[01:17:19.865 --> 01:17:24.328]  I've just seen so many of your shows, so many of the research you've done, so many things we've talked about personally.
[01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:28.390]  I would like to get you to, when we get back, to talk about whatever you like.
[01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:32.673]  Current politics, what's happening, how you woke up, what you think is wrong.
[01:17:32.993 --> 01:17:34.814]  What are some of the things you want to discuss when we get back?
[01:17:35.646 --> 01:17:52.894]  Okay, I'd like to discuss this process of changing from, and how many people have done it, have decided that their military career was, they were like, we're like mercenaries employed to defend the special interest of global corporations.
[01:17:53.034 --> 01:18:03.279]  Instead, in the vital interest of the United States, the few times that they are defined, seem very close to the vital interest of global corporations to me.
[01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:11.134]  And I've raised that point before, and I believe it firmly, and I've had support from other military people who believe the same thing.
[01:18:11.914 --> 01:18:13.615]  Well, they wouldn't say that five years ago.
[01:18:13.695 --> 01:18:20.299]  Now the darling of the Naval War College, Dr. Barnett, goes on C-SPAN and says, we don't work for America.
[01:18:20.339 --> 01:18:20.999]  I've got him on tape.
[01:18:21.099 --> 01:18:24.361]  We work for global corporations, and this is a new world order.
[01:18:25.542 --> 01:18:31.345]  Well, I can refer you to a particular guy, Smedley Butler, who was a general in the Marine Corps.
[01:18:31.525 --> 01:18:33.286]  Well, they asked him to carry out a coup, and he said no.
[01:18:33.446 --> 01:18:33.986]  That's right.
[01:18:34.266 --> 01:18:35.207]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:36.019 --> 01:18:39.901]  Well, he comes out and says... Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:18:39.921 --> 01:18:41.002]  We've got to hear that quote when we get back.
[01:18:41.062 --> 01:18:42.242]  Quick break with our guest.
[01:18:42.662 --> 01:18:44.583]  He's Don Darling, a good friend of mine.
[01:18:45.004 --> 01:18:47.645]  And we'll tell you about Veterans for Peace and a lot more when we get back.
[01:18:47.685 --> 01:18:48.405]  So stay with us.
[01:18:55.909 --> 01:18:57.550]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.130 --> 01:18:59.891]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.981 --> 01:19:01.582]  We're good to go.
[01:19:01.622 --> 01:19:02.203]  We're good to go.
[01:19:17.103 --> 01:19:21.485]  We can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:21.885 --> 01:19:23.565]  Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:23.885 --> 01:19:25.086]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[01:19:25.326 --> 01:19:25.646]  That's 702-953-0267.
[01:19:25.666 --> 01:19:26.786]  Or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:45.337]  That's www.lasemedinc.com or call LazeMed at 702-953-0267 today.
[01:19:53.826 --> 01:19:57.509]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:57.909 --> 01:20:03.333]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:03.794 --> 01:20:08.958]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:09.598 --> 01:20:22.902]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:28.723]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:29.023 --> 01:20:34.905]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:35.563]  1-800-686-2237
[01:20:53.331 --> 01:20:58.615]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:20:58.836 --> 01:21:00.917]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:21:01.158 --> 01:21:08.263]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:21:08.403 --> 01:21:19.953]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:22.355]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple
[01:21:22.415 --> 01:21:27.239]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:27.399 --> 01:21:28.880]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:29.501]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:53.379 --> 01:21:55.081]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:58.484]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:21:58.804 --> 01:22:04.088]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:22:04.388 --> 01:22:13.936]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:22:14.216 --> 01:22:16.398]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[01:22:16.678 --> 01:22:20.241]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:22:20.501 --> 01:22:23.723]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:22:24.004 --> 01:22:27.546]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:22:27.707 --> 01:22:31.169]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:22:31.309 --> 01:22:32.570]  I'm really amazed.
[01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:38.575]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:22:38.715 --> 01:22:41.117]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:22:41.477 --> 01:22:48.178]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:22:48.198 --> 01:22:49.598]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:22:49.778 --> 01:22:54.539]  Later in the shower, we'll open the phones up.
[01:22:54.559 --> 01:22:56.240]  We're going to talk to Don Darling.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.460]  We can do a whole show just on submarine rescue.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:00.980]  It's so interesting.
[01:23:10.715 --> 01:23:16.339]  But, Don, let's kind of start accelerating through, because I want to get into DU, what's currently happening with that, with uranium.
[01:23:16.779 --> 01:23:21.062]  I want to get into how we work for the global corporations, and those aren't the interests of the American people.
[01:23:21.542 --> 01:23:29.367]  And then I want to get into the USS Liberty, and a lot more before you leave us today, and what you think of the whole Iran-Iraq situation as it develops.
[01:23:29.427 --> 01:23:30.968]  But please continue, sir.
[01:23:32.469 --> 01:23:32.989]  Okay.
[01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:37.973]  Well, again, it's very difficult to make that transition from a red, white, and blue...
[01:23:39.019 --> 01:23:47.082]  Committed, dedicated, commissioned, or enlisted man in the service of the United States to somebody who speaks out.
[01:23:47.642 --> 01:23:53.564]  But we feel it's our patriotic duty to speak out if we see things that are wrong with our country.
[01:23:54.024 --> 01:24:02.546]  I'm patriotic to the United States of America, to the Constitution of the United States, and not to George Bush or any of the presidents.
[01:24:02.566 --> 01:24:03.647]  This is President's Day.
[01:24:06.027 --> 01:24:08.028]  I really kind of almost resent that.
[01:24:10.191 --> 01:24:12.352]  I want to talk to you about campaign medals.
[01:24:13.112 --> 01:24:25.654]  During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon realized that for little pieces of ribbon and little pieces of metal, he could get people to risk their lives to achieve his goals.
[01:24:26.374 --> 01:24:33.776]  And another quote is from Napoleon, with a handful of ribbons, I can conquer all of Europe.
[01:24:34.309 --> 01:24:41.193]  So these ribbons that are so sought after are just come-ons to get us to risk our lives.
[01:24:41.413 --> 01:24:46.035]  It's like buying Long Island for a chest of glass beads.
[01:24:46.876 --> 01:24:48.316]  Yeah.
[01:24:49.077 --> 01:24:50.558]  What about that Smedley Butler quote?
[01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:57.081]  Well, Smedley Butler was a general in the Marine Corps who earned two Congressional Medals of Honor.
[01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:09.923]  He says, I spent 33 years and 4 months in active service as a member of our country's most agile military force, the Marine Corps.
[01:25:12.044 --> 01:25:20.051]  He goes on to say, during that period, I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for big business, for Wall Street, for the bankers.
[01:25:20.491 --> 01:25:22.633]  In short, I was a racketeer for capitalism.
[01:25:23.402 --> 01:25:25.562]  And I feel that way now, too.
[01:25:25.682 --> 01:25:28.563]  And I think a lot of veterans feel that way.
[01:25:28.963 --> 01:25:31.424]  Of course, a lot of them are still patriotic.
[01:25:31.464 --> 01:25:36.925]  They're still hooked on that patriotism, my country, right or wrong.
[01:25:37.005 --> 01:25:44.686]  Well, last hour, even if the government's saying do something that's actually anti-American, that's supposedly more American to destroy American freedom.
[01:25:45.046 --> 01:25:49.467]  Last hour, Don, I talked a lot about the police state, martial law, FEMA camps.
[01:25:50.047 --> 01:25:50.427]  I think so.
[01:26:12.129 --> 01:26:19.052]  Yeah, he did, and it turned out he was a true patriot that spoke out openly.
[01:26:19.112 --> 01:26:20.473]  Well, he had that super courage.
[01:26:20.873 --> 01:26:26.916]  This is a two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner in World War I, you name it, and then here he is saying, no, I won't do that.
[01:26:26.936 --> 01:26:28.477]  See, he really was a patriot.
[01:26:31.278 --> 01:26:33.379]  There was a prelude to all this.
[01:26:33.439 --> 01:26:39.582]  This guy, John Dryden, was an Englishman who was kind of the spokesman for his age.
[01:26:39.642 --> 01:26:39.882]  He was...
[01:26:40.858 --> 01:26:52.688]  He wrote in a prophetic insight, he wrote, Such subtle covenant shall be made till peace itself is war and masquerade.
[01:26:53.049 --> 01:27:05.199]  Now, if he were around today, to more fully cover the subtle covenants of the present age, he might have added, till morality itself is bigotry and masquerade.
[01:27:05.885 --> 01:27:07.466]  What do you mean by mapmakers?
[01:27:07.546 --> 01:27:08.806]  Break that down for people.
[01:27:08.826 --> 01:27:13.288]  Well, mapmakers of reality, they are people who write propaganda, for example.
[01:27:30.681 --> 01:27:34.003]  And make us believe that something's real that isn't real.
[01:27:34.863 --> 01:27:37.404]  Advertisers are mapmakers of reality.
[01:27:37.704 --> 01:27:48.489]  And so are people like Helen Keller, who showed us how to be blind and still to do well and to be a citizen of merit.
[01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:51.831]  There are a lot of different mapmakers, good and bad.
[01:27:52.691 --> 01:27:54.252]  Well, I mean, the human mind's a computer.
[01:27:54.292 --> 01:27:57.954]  You can have garbage in and garbage out, or real information in and real information out.
[01:27:58.436 --> 01:27:58.997]  Yes, that's right.
[01:27:59.017 --> 01:27:59.257]  Yeah.
[01:28:12.917 --> 01:28:20.162]  A subtle covenant shall be made till peace itself is war and masquerade.
[01:28:20.422 --> 01:28:21.903]  War masquerading as peace.
[01:28:22.084 --> 01:28:23.304]  I want to talk about Veterans for Peace.
[01:28:23.344 --> 01:28:33.832]  I want to talk about the Iran situation and the USS Liberty, DU, because you've been involved in the nuclear program as well, and we'll also get into Karl Rove and the rest of them.
[01:28:34.312 --> 01:28:35.633]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:30:53.268 --> 01:30:55.429]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?

[01:31:16.736 --> 01:31:17.297]  Call now.

[01:31:18.377 --> 01:31:30.320]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.860]  We got immediate results.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.461]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[01:31:34.921 --> 01:31:43.202]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the total transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.

[01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:47.845]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402
[01:32:19.425 --> 01:32:21.106]  For liberty.
[01:32:22.506 --> 01:32:24.167]  For their descendants.
[01:32:24.407 --> 01:32:28.288]  America is America because we have the Bill of Rights, because we have the Constitution.
[01:32:28.448 --> 01:32:29.549]  That's what makes us different.
[01:32:29.809 --> 01:32:30.709]  We've never been perfect.
[01:32:31.029 --> 01:32:32.790]  Now all of that is being erased.
[01:32:33.408 --> 01:32:37.009]  And the Attorney General and the President say, oh, because the Constitution says so.
[01:32:37.449 --> 01:32:40.050]  Then you go read it, and it's the complete opposite.
[01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:42.771]  We are seeing a dictatorship being perfected.
[01:32:43.311 --> 01:32:49.593]  And we've had so many congressmen, so many experts, so many former members of the Reagan, Bush senior, even the current Bush administration.
[01:32:49.613 --> 01:32:54.694]  Morgan Reynolds has come on here, their chief economist for the Department of Labor.
[01:32:54.794 --> 01:32:56.015]  We are going into this.
[01:32:56.055 --> 01:32:57.215]  There's no debating it.
[01:32:57.825 --> 01:33:06.589]  Just a few weeks ago, Bob Barb, who we also had on the show and who agreed with our analysis, got up and gave a speech against the police state in signing over all authority to the president.
[01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:15.574]  He was booed off the stage, and Viet Dinh, who'd been the deputy attorney general under Ashcroft, got up and said, no, the president is the law, and they had a standing ovation.
[01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:17.914]  I mean, this is the brown shirts.
[01:33:17.994 --> 01:33:18.994]  They want the power.
[01:33:19.054 --> 01:33:19.975]  They want the control.
[01:33:20.055 --> 01:33:20.995]  They smell blood.
[01:33:21.375 --> 01:33:22.516]  They think they're going to get it.
[01:33:23.096 --> 01:33:24.357]  And they're not conservatives.
[01:33:24.577 --> 01:33:26.117]  I'm what you can call a real conservative.
[01:33:26.137 --> 01:33:27.258]  I'm pro-Second Amendment.
[01:33:27.638 --> 01:33:29.019]  Okay, I want to control our borders.
[01:33:29.079 --> 01:33:30.760]  I'm for national sovereignty.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.760]  And they ain't it.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:32.901]  They're not it.
[01:33:33.261 --> 01:33:35.922]  And the Democrats are predominantly for this war as well.
[01:33:35.962 --> 01:33:37.223]  Some of them more hawkish, like...
[01:33:38.503 --> 01:33:39.024]  We're good to go.
[01:34:07.006 --> 01:34:07.448]  We're good to go.
[01:34:14.368 --> 01:34:26.650]  Don, I want to just get your take on the same crew that, in our own documents, we now have the Downing Street and the White House memo, where they said they were going to manufacture evidence, signed by them, that they don't even deny its authenticity.
[01:34:27.811 --> 01:34:29.971]  We have them using the exact same propaganda.
[01:34:30.291 --> 01:34:40.313]  In fact, there have been news articles where they'll give a speech, and it's exactly the same line for line, just Iraq is changed to Iran, and they're using the same lies for a new country.
[01:34:40.493 --> 01:34:41.313]  Give me your take on that.
[01:34:42.964 --> 01:34:50.212]  Well, it is exactly what people that profit from warfare want.
[01:34:50.232 --> 01:34:53.715]  And it's amazing to me how addicted to war we are here.
[01:34:54.896 --> 01:35:00.542]  I think it's ridiculous to be engaging in wars that take our...
[01:35:02.006 --> 01:35:03.927]  Resources, our economic resources.
[01:35:03.947 --> 01:35:09.750]  We have people in the Gulf Coast that are in dire need of those resources now.
[01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:11.331]  But we're spending them on war.
[01:35:11.711 --> 01:35:16.294]  Another thing we're doing that bothers the heck out of me is we're using war as a
[01:35:17.274 --> 01:35:20.076]  It's a worthy challenge for our young people.
[01:35:20.216 --> 01:35:20.716]  It's not.
[01:35:21.176 --> 01:35:31.882]  Don't we have alternatives we can use to challenge our young people to make them mature like a vision quest for the Native Americans and for the
[01:35:33.342 --> 01:35:42.666]  Well, you're back to mapmakers of reality.
[01:35:42.866 --> 01:35:54.931]  They tell you to be a man, you've got to go join the military, and there's nothing wrong with that, but then they give them experimental shots, they breathe DU, they use them in wars that are a fraud, and supposedly, this is how you become a man.
[01:35:55.859 --> 01:35:57.841]  Well, I think we do need a military, Alex.
[01:35:58.201 --> 01:35:58.882]  I think we do.
[01:35:59.082 --> 01:36:01.824]  But about a third of what we have now.
[01:36:03.125 --> 01:36:04.947]  Because we live in a hostile world.
[01:36:05.027 --> 01:36:06.849]  Why is it hostile toward us?
[01:36:06.889 --> 01:36:08.410]  We're in 160 plus countries.
[01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:09.271]  Is that in an empire?
[01:36:09.291 --> 01:36:09.931]  I don't know what is.
[01:36:10.732 --> 01:36:11.353]  Well, yes.
[01:36:12.654 --> 01:36:14.115]  Why are they hostile toward us?
[01:36:14.575 --> 01:36:20.801]  Because our foreign policies and our domestic policies are... Why doesn't anybody want to attack Canada?
[01:36:21.744 --> 01:36:26.747]  Well, because they are not doing the things that we're doing.
[01:36:27.567 --> 01:36:33.651]  They are minding their own business and taking care of their people and helping other countries.
[01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:36.333]  So many Americans think, though, they go, well, I want that oil.
[01:36:36.353 --> 01:36:37.493]  I've heard them on talk radio.
[01:36:37.513 --> 01:36:38.454]  Yeah, it's about oil.
[01:36:38.494 --> 01:36:39.034]  We need it.
[01:36:39.635 --> 01:36:44.858]  Don't they know that the same corporations that are raping Iraq are raping the American people?
[01:36:44.878 --> 01:36:48.520]  I mean, there's so many folks out there who think they're part of this power structure.
[01:36:50.635 --> 01:36:52.356]  It's amazing to me too, Alex.
[01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:55.276]  I see you on television.
[01:36:55.797 --> 01:36:58.997]  Sometimes you almost come to tears, man.
[01:37:00.278 --> 01:37:02.539]  And you're telling them what they need to hear.
[01:37:03.259 --> 01:37:09.120]  You're doing one of the hardest jobs there is to do, telling people what they don't want to hear in ways that they will listen to it.
[01:37:10.121 --> 01:37:12.922]  And I congratulate you in that regard.
[01:37:13.242 --> 01:37:14.282]  You do that very well.
[01:37:15.794 --> 01:37:17.355]  Don, let's get into some tough subjects.
[01:37:17.475 --> 01:37:22.459]  I've interviewed, I don't know, four admirals, including the former chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore.
[01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:27.182]  I've interviewed the admiral before he died who took the phone call.
[01:37:27.222 --> 01:37:35.267]  I mean, I've talked to the admiral who took the phone call when LBJ said, I want that GD ship going to the bottom.
[01:37:35.287 --> 01:37:36.088]  I mean, that's a quote.
[01:37:37.114 --> 01:37:42.018]  They're bombing it for hours, strafing it, shooting the lifeboats, 30-something dead of 130-something crew.
[01:37:42.258 --> 01:37:43.600]  Go on for memory, correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.683]  And all this is happening just to blame it on Egypt.
[01:37:48.744 --> 01:37:52.147]  And Israeli pilots gone public and said, yeah, we knew what we were doing, we were ordered to do it.
[01:37:52.507 --> 01:37:58.512]  I mean, that's an example of how cold-blooded, and our own admirals wanted to go save the ship, our own fighter pilots.
[01:37:58.532 --> 01:38:03.456]  And then I talked to the second mate and others, who once they got on the ship a day later,
[01:38:03.456 --> 01:38:03.776]  We're good to go.
[01:38:03.836 --> 01:38:04.597]  We're good to go.
[01:38:04.617 --> 01:38:06.078]  We're good to go.
[01:38:25.988 --> 01:38:30.811]  And to interview admirals who witnessed all of this, I mean, the ship did nothing.
[01:38:30.831 --> 01:38:42.078]  And clearly, and they all agree now, it's clear that our government, the White House, LBJ, it was basically Operation Northwoods is what they're implementing.
[01:38:42.979 --> 01:38:47.341]  And the Israelis were going to sink and kill all survivors and blame it on Egypt, clearly.
[01:38:47.361 --> 01:38:53.684]  I mean, that is an example for anybody in the military out there that doesn't understand that you're nothing to these controllers.
[01:38:54.045 --> 01:38:57.546]  They've taken the most honorable, most loved country and most loved military.
[01:38:57.566 --> 01:38:58.867]  We were the good guys in the past.
[01:38:59.287 --> 01:39:03.948]  And we become evil, and we've got to apologize for that and start rectifying it.
[01:39:04.048 --> 01:39:07.809]  I don't want my children to be known as Americans who come from an evil country.
[01:39:07.869 --> 01:39:12.191]  I don't want these evil people to use the great history and prowess of this nation.
[01:39:12.211 --> 01:39:14.631]  So can you speak to the USS Liberty?
[01:39:16.092 --> 01:39:16.852]  I've interviewed the...
[01:39:18.297 --> 01:39:24.680]  Medical officer, Liberty, who had to deal with 34 people dead and 170-some wounded.
[01:39:25.221 --> 01:39:28.122]  He was himself grievously wounded.
[01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:29.263]  I've seen his scars.
[01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:33.945]  He had to wear a life jacket to keep his intestines in.
[01:39:34.085 --> 01:39:34.906]  So did the captain.
[01:39:35.506 --> 01:39:43.370]  Yeah, well, I mean, they were walking around in the blood and brains of their shipmates during that thing.
[01:39:44.818 --> 01:39:56.210]  Captain, then Lieutenant Richard Kiefer, the medical officer, was on his feet treating people for about, I don't know, 17, 18, 20 some hours.
[01:39:56.770 --> 01:39:57.671]  Long, long time.
[01:39:57.751 --> 01:39:58.892]  I asked him how he did that.
[01:39:58.952 --> 01:40:05.659]  He said, well, I took a syringe and put a little shot of morphine in a syringe.
[01:40:07.665 --> 01:40:09.606]  And I gave myself microdoses.
[01:40:10.167 --> 01:40:11.507]  And he also said he was so angry.
[01:40:11.567 --> 01:40:12.188]  He really did.
[01:40:12.628 --> 01:40:13.729]  He said he wanted to get through it.
[01:40:13.909 --> 01:40:14.569]  He was so angry.
[01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.949]  Yeah.
[01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:16.330]  We interviewed him, too.
[01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:17.131]  Oh, you did, too.
[01:40:17.331 --> 01:40:17.631]  Yeah.
[01:40:17.991 --> 01:40:20.693]  Well, so anyway, he did that.
[01:40:20.793 --> 01:40:25.716]  And he walked that fine line between being able to stand the pain.
[01:40:26.661 --> 01:40:32.483]  And to think clearly in performing the medical duties that he had to do, that was heroic, I thought.
[01:40:33.123 --> 01:40:41.466]  And I'm really resentful that our government would do that to people that are there to defend the government.
[01:40:42.106 --> 01:40:44.847]  Not the government, but the Constitution of the United States.
[01:40:46.608 --> 01:40:47.928]  And it was a sellout.
[01:40:47.988 --> 01:40:53.930]  I mean, I don't know how we in the military can trust our government when things like that happen.
[01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:56.011]  Well, they do it over and over again.
[01:40:56.051 --> 01:41:00.513]  I've been researching Operation Gladio, and I've been researching the NATO option.
[01:41:01.314 --> 01:41:03.895]  Funny, in the next room I've got about four inches of documents.
[01:41:03.915 --> 01:41:04.836]  I'm making a film about it.
[01:41:05.796 --> 01:41:12.820]  CIA website, National Archives, admits hundreds of bombings our government carried out all over the world to blame it on their political enemies.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.561]  And their favorite was school buses.
[01:41:14.581 --> 01:41:18.263]  They like to blow up school buses of kids, because then that would really get people mad.
[01:41:18.303 --> 01:41:20.624]  And you're reading this, and you talk about freaking out.
[01:41:20.644 --> 01:41:23.486]  I mean, I'll be up here late at night while it's a rainy night and it's cold outside at night.
[01:41:23.726 --> 01:41:35.511]  Well, they must be criminals.
[01:41:35.551 --> 01:41:38.813]  They certainly aren't people that care about the Constitution very much.
[01:41:39.413 --> 01:41:42.334]  And they don't have the American people.
[01:41:42.654 --> 01:41:46.896]  I get sick when I hear them talk about, well, the American people, this and that.
[01:41:47.696 --> 01:41:50.257]  They don't give a damn about the American people, I don't think.
[01:41:50.818 --> 01:41:50.898]  And...
[01:41:52.493 --> 01:41:57.756]  I'm resentful of that because I and a lot of us have risked our lives to defend this country.
[01:41:58.196 --> 01:42:01.858]  And this isn't the country that we thought we were defending.
[01:42:01.998 --> 01:42:07.221]  Well, Don, they're the patriots, the guys that sit around in offices with their millions of dollars and their mistresses.
[01:42:07.662 --> 01:42:14.465]  They're the patriots, they say, who send a ship off to premeditatedly attack it to blame it on Egypt to start World War III.
[01:42:14.746 --> 01:42:16.426]  See, they think it's patriotic what they do.
[01:42:17.787 --> 01:42:18.988]  I don't know how they can think that.
[01:42:19.348 --> 01:42:19.968]  I really don't.
[01:42:20.028 --> 01:42:20.889]  How can they think that?
[01:42:21.778 --> 01:42:26.780]  I mean, what drives people to that level of obtuseness?
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:30.121]  What is it that makes them go in that direction?
[01:42:30.961 --> 01:42:32.282]  I've wondered that a long time.
[01:42:33.002 --> 01:42:38.184]  And I've asked some of the guests that I've had on television, what do you think the root cause is of all this?
[01:42:38.504 --> 01:42:42.285]  And the best answer I've gotten, unfettered greed.
[01:42:43.038 --> 01:42:43.258]  It is.
[01:42:43.278 --> 01:42:45.919]  They're on a power trip, and they rationalize.
[01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:51.361]  I don't know your personal thought processes, but I'm guilty for things I did when I was 12 years old.
[01:42:51.401 --> 01:42:52.541]  I'm guilty for things I did when I was 18.
[01:42:53.342 --> 01:42:58.483]  I'm guilty for being rude to a grandmother one time years ago, and she's dead now.
[01:42:59.324 --> 01:43:07.146]  I'm guilty when I'm rude to my wife, and I don't see that as a weakness that I have a conscience or that I feel like I need to warn people and help society.
[01:43:07.426 --> 01:43:10.267]  I thought that was normal, but according to these globalists, I'm a weakling.
[01:43:10.627 --> 01:43:12.028]  I'm weak because I'm soft.
[01:43:14.358 --> 01:43:16.239]  I don't know how to respond to that, Alex.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:29.926]  It's just incredible the conditions that we're under here and how far we've gone from, well, at least from what I thought was our foundations, the foundations on which America is built.
[01:43:31.448 --> 01:43:36.430]  Maybe some of the mapmakers of reality were the writers of our Constitution.
[01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:38.851]  A reality that I don't think we've achieved yet.
[01:43:39.331 --> 01:43:44.413]  I hope someday we can become the country that we've only pretended to be up to this point.
[01:43:44.453 --> 01:43:48.695]  Did you see that quote in the New York Times attributed to a reporter talking to Karl Rove?
[01:43:48.735 --> 01:43:50.976]  And he said, look, you guys say whatever you want, do whatever you want.
[01:43:51.016 --> 01:43:52.096]  We control reality.
[01:43:52.817 --> 01:43:54.997]  In fact, I believe the quote was, we make the maps.
[01:43:55.338 --> 01:43:58.139]  He said, we control reality and the rest of you are just spectators.
[01:43:58.459 --> 01:43:59.659]  I think they've gone loony.
[01:43:59.719 --> 01:44:01.260]  I think they're believing their own propaganda.
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:02.341]  I think they are, too.
[01:44:02.901 --> 01:44:04.222]  How could it not be that way?
[01:44:04.822 --> 01:44:06.843]  And what do we do about it?
[01:44:07.944 --> 01:44:09.145]  What do we do about it, Alex?
[01:44:09.265 --> 01:44:10.726]  That's another question I've had.
[01:44:10.826 --> 01:44:19.071]  I think we get people, frankly, I think things are going to get worse and worse, and we've got to wake people up so as they get worse and worse, people who were in denial will at least later wake up.
[01:44:19.131 --> 01:44:28.016]  I found doing this almost 12 years that no one listened to me 12 years ago, and now everybody does because people know deep down something's wrong, Don.
[01:44:28.236 --> 01:44:29.897]  Aren't you finding people are more receptive to you?
[01:44:30.137 --> 01:44:30.758]  Yes, I am.
[01:44:31.488 --> 01:44:31.769]  I am.
[01:44:32.329 --> 01:44:32.730]  Not all.
[01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:46.705]  I mean, there's still the folks that have bought into the red, white, and blue, the John Phillips suits and marches and all that stuff about patriotism that turns out to be very close to fascism.
[01:44:47.206 --> 01:44:51.791]  If you look in the dictionary, read about patriotism and fascism, you'll see they're not far apart.
[01:44:52.651 --> 01:44:59.097]  Well, patriotism towards the Fuhrer, towards the government, is patriotism to the documents and to a way of life, is Americana.
[01:44:59.497 --> 01:45:03.401]  But you're right, that false patriotism you're talking about is truly evil.
[01:45:04.382 --> 01:45:06.844]  I want to take some calls, but I want to get into DU.
[01:45:06.904 --> 01:45:10.147]  Now, I've had Doug Rockey on, Dr. Doug Rockey.
[01:45:10.387 --> 01:45:16.373]  I've read on air, we've posted them, the Army Field Manual, saying it's deadly poison and radioactive and particulate.
[01:45:18.093 --> 01:45:24.395]  Just a small whiff of it, a few thousand particulates, it's going to kill you.
[01:45:24.455 --> 01:45:26.836]  Or make the rest of your life very, very painful.
[01:45:27.156 --> 01:45:28.196]  Massive birth defects.
[01:45:28.256 --> 01:45:31.337]  The Fed's own numbers triple the birth defects from the first Gulf War.
[01:45:31.417 --> 01:45:33.578]  Now three years in, we're getting a quadrupling.
[01:45:33.818 --> 01:45:34.758]  And that's in our troops.
[01:45:35.198 --> 01:45:36.198]  This is official numbers.
[01:45:36.558 --> 01:45:39.399]  Even higher with the Iraqis and the Serbs and the Afghanis.
[01:45:39.919 --> 01:45:42.160]  And we have ten proving grounds here in the U.S.,
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:51.406]  Now the military was only going to use that if the Russians came into Europe and they were going to load the Shabos and the Abrams M1A and different tanks with it.
[01:45:52.106 --> 01:45:55.409]  Now they're serving it out to dozens and dozens of different weapons.
[01:45:55.429 --> 01:46:01.133]  They've used three times the numbers this go-around in Iraq that they used in 1991.
[01:46:01.493 --> 01:46:02.654]  They know it's deadly.
[01:46:03.414 --> 01:46:07.377]  I have Atomic Energy Agency documents from 25 years ago saying it's deadly.
[01:46:07.877 --> 01:46:14.140]  How does the elite let our troops and the Iraqis breathe this and just say, no, it's not bad for you?
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.481]  I mean, see, it seems like the government was bad 20 years ago.
[01:46:17.561 --> 01:46:19.682]  Now it's reaching just insane levels.
[01:46:20.003 --> 01:46:29.327]  Generals, I was reading, will move into a base bombarded with it and will just have sand dumped on where the shells impacted, breathing it themselves.
[01:46:29.627 --> 01:46:31.728]  The New World Order even doesn't breathe it themselves.
[01:46:32.882 --> 01:46:34.503]  Yeah, it's crazy, all right.
[01:46:35.324 --> 01:46:58.020]  I've interviewed Doug Rocky, too, and I think he's a good, honorable man and a true patriot who has seen the light about depleted uranium, but he sees it about a lot of other things, too, about the toxic aftermath of our presence, and most anywhere in the world.
[01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:08.983]  Another guy who sees a toxic nature of our foreign policy, of our policies, is Dave Grossman who wrote On Killing.
[01:47:09.383 --> 01:47:10.164]  Do you know about him?
[01:47:11.019 --> 01:47:11.619]  I've heard of him.
[01:47:11.679 --> 01:47:12.480]  I mean to interview him.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:14.121]  Yeah, I do.
[01:47:14.201 --> 01:47:15.662]  Be sure to write me a note before we go.
[01:47:15.922 --> 01:47:18.924]  And I don't mean to digress, but going back to you, you're an atomic sailor.
[01:47:19.244 --> 01:47:20.385]  I mean, you were on the nuclear sub.
[01:47:20.405 --> 01:47:21.505]  You were on the rescue vessel.
[01:47:21.805 --> 01:47:24.867]  You talked about having a birth defect with one of your children.
[01:47:24.887 --> 01:47:28.750]  I mean, these are real numbers that cannot be debated.
[01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:32.792]  I mean, from your own personal experience, you physically and your daughter.
[01:47:32.852 --> 01:47:33.873]  I mean, give us your view on it.
[01:47:34.153 --> 01:47:37.315]  Okay, I was a reactor operator at the S-1W plant.
[01:47:39.235 --> 01:47:41.176]  Nautilus prototype.
[01:47:41.736 --> 01:47:48.299]  It was a full nuclear power plant, not clear-fold, but with only one propeller.
[01:47:48.319 --> 01:47:56.262]  It wasn't a propeller, it was a water break, so we tested the nuclear power plant of the submarine Nautilus, the first submarine.
[01:47:56.922 --> 01:48:05.145]  And I was in end-of-core-life testing of that facility, and I pulled rods on the reactor there,
[01:48:06.432 --> 01:48:12.457]  Max rate with only two 120% scram power levels engaged.
[01:48:12.517 --> 01:48:13.758]  Please put it in layman's terms.
[01:48:13.919 --> 01:48:15.760]  Okay.
[01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.663]  We were checking to see if the thing would melt down.
[01:48:20.084 --> 01:48:22.186]  Westinghouse was the... So they guinea-pigged you.
[01:48:22.206 --> 01:48:22.767]  They gave you a test.
[01:48:22.807 --> 01:48:23.667]  They guinea-pigged me.
[01:48:23.707 --> 01:48:24.288]  That's right.
[01:48:24.328 --> 01:48:24.989]  They gave you a test.
[01:48:25.009 --> 01:48:26.070]  They knew it was going to radiate you.
[01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:29.593]  Well, I don't know how they could not have known.
[01:48:30.126 --> 01:48:36.171]  And if things had melted down, they would have blamed me for going in and doing an irrational thing.
[01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:39.054]  I took orders to pull those rods.
[01:48:39.434 --> 01:48:42.677]  And I saw the power level peak out and the startup rate peak out.
[01:48:42.717 --> 01:48:45.639]  These are instruments that tell you the condition of that reaction.
[01:48:45.659 --> 01:48:48.141]  So they just marched you right in there knowing what they were going to do?
[01:48:48.161 --> 01:48:49.302]  Well, they proved that...
[01:48:50.303 --> 01:48:56.949]  To their satisfaction, it didn't prove anything, really, but the rods did drop, and the reactor did shut down, and it didn't melt down.
[01:48:57.369 --> 01:49:02.093]  But it sure irradiated me, and ten months later, I had a child born with a birth defect.
[01:49:02.673 --> 01:49:03.414]  A serious one.
[01:49:03.434 --> 01:49:07.177]  The leg ended halfway between the knee and where the ankle should have been.
[01:49:08.558 --> 01:49:14.904]  And the Navy didn't pay for, the military didn't pay for getting prosthesis for my daughter.
[01:49:15.384 --> 01:49:18.987]  The Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children was recommended to us, and
[01:49:19.451 --> 01:49:20.692]  Thank God it was there.
[01:49:20.752 --> 01:49:22.413]  We went and it took care of the problem.
[01:49:22.933 --> 01:49:28.656]  Twenty-some years later, I had a spinal cord tumor from this radiation.
[01:49:29.477 --> 01:49:30.777]  Well, there's another example.
[01:49:30.837 --> 01:49:38.662]  Declassified Project Shad, they would just march a young lieutenant in, hit him with nerve gas and kill him and dissect him.
[01:49:40.002 --> 01:49:41.523]  I mean, how do they do this?
[01:49:44.031 --> 01:49:47.434]  Just march into that reactor, darling, and pull those rods.
[01:49:47.794 --> 01:49:48.555]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:48.595 --> 01:49:49.015]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:57.762]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.003 --> 01:49:58.703]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.803 --> 01:49:59.584]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.924 --> 01:50:04.608]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.948 --> 01:50:11.674]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.994 --> 01:50:13.975]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.175 --> 01:50:17.016]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.136 --> 01:50:21.778]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.978 --> 01:50:26.379]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:33.842]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.102 --> 01:50:36.523]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:54.051 --> 01:51:00.275]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:00.415 --> 01:51:06.578]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.859 --> 01:51:15.304]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:15.544 --> 01:51:22.568]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.868 --> 01:51:27.691]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.911 --> 01:51:33.315]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.655 --> 01:51:36.737]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:37.078 --> 01:51:45.023]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.083 --> 01:51:45.663]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.290 --> 01:51:55.830]  We're good to go.
[01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:56.131]  I think?
[01:52:10.942 --> 01:52:11.562]  I think so too.
[01:52:26.451 --> 01:52:27.351]  We're good to go.
[01:52:27.371 --> 01:52:27.872]  We're good to go.
[01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:10.447]  Alan Pogue is another off tonight, and he's been a combat journalist, photographer forever.
[01:53:10.527 --> 01:53:12.468]  He was a combat medic in Vietnam.
[01:53:13.277 --> 01:53:19.321]  And he's been in New Orleans lately, and a lot of the pictures you've seen in the national media of Mr. Whittington, he took.
[01:53:19.361 --> 01:53:22.363]  He's going to be in here, in studio with us, in the next hour.
[01:53:22.423 --> 01:53:25.785]  And Don Darling has decided to ride shotgun with us as well.
[01:53:25.845 --> 01:53:36.131]  Before I go to Mike and Matt and David and others that are holding, I want to just briefly encourage all of you to go to InfoWars.com and to get my new film, Martial Law, that really shows who carried out 9-11.
[01:53:36.231 --> 01:53:39.553]  Without a shadow of a doubt, we show that it was a military-industrial complex op.
[01:53:40.234 --> 01:53:40.715]  Bottom line.
[01:53:40.755 --> 01:53:42.897]  We have the documents, the evidence, all of it.
[01:54:05.385 --> 01:54:05.906]  We're good to go.
[01:54:27.424 --> 01:54:31.787]  A bunch of other films, like Dylan Avery's Loose Change 2nd Edition on 9-11.
[01:54:32.168 --> 01:54:32.728]  Excellent film.
[01:54:32.768 --> 01:54:33.148]  It's there.
[01:54:33.228 --> 01:54:38.672]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all these e-books, all my best audio interviews, special text reports for members.
[01:54:39.133 --> 01:54:40.234]  It's $0.15 a day.
[01:54:40.374 --> 01:54:41.595]  Monthly subscription is $5.95.
[01:54:41.695 --> 01:54:45.257]  If you get a yearly subscription, it's three months free.
[01:54:45.538 --> 01:54:47.839]  So go to prisonplanet.tv.
[01:54:47.999 --> 01:54:49.440]  Don, are you ready to take some calls?
[01:54:49.601 --> 01:54:49.901]  You bet.
[01:54:50.461 --> 01:54:52.463]  All right, let's talk to Mike in New York.
[01:54:52.523 --> 01:54:54.744]  Mike, thanks for holding your own here with Don Darling.
[01:54:55.465 --> 01:54:55.945]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:56.005 --> 01:54:56.506]  Hi, Don.
[01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:05.533]  First, Don, thank you for your service and everything you've contributed from your life to serve our country.
[01:55:05.674 --> 01:55:12.857]  It's very sad when you learn the real truth that all the service guys basically have been used because all the wars are prefab.
[01:55:12.917 --> 01:55:14.537]  We all know that.
[01:55:14.637 --> 01:55:15.678]  I want to thank you.
[01:55:16.038 --> 01:55:16.758]  I'll pray for you.
[01:55:16.798 --> 01:55:19.119]  God bless you and everyone that you love.
[01:55:22.017 --> 01:55:38.278]  You know, getting back to the port scenario, I was talking with Mark Levin at WABC the other day, a phony conservative, just like you're nailing him, and he says basically that he's not a protectionist, that anybody complaining...
[01:55:38.738 --> 01:55:39.258]  Well, that's my point.
[01:55:39.278 --> 01:55:42.720]  When Bill Clinton was doing this exact same thing with the Chi Coms, I was decrying it.
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:44.021]  I'm decrying it now.
[01:55:44.041 --> 01:55:46.162]  But Don Darling would like to comment on your statement.
[01:55:46.222 --> 01:55:47.083]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:55:47.123 --> 01:55:48.804]  Well, I just want to thank you for holding, Michael.
[01:56:04.872 --> 01:56:08.234]  I'm glad to hear comments like yours.
[01:56:09.034 --> 01:56:10.194]  That's what keeps us going.
[01:56:10.634 --> 01:56:11.315]  Thanks.
[01:56:11.355 --> 01:56:13.536]  Also, a plug about Veterans for Peace that you're a member of.
[01:56:14.016 --> 01:56:14.456]  Oh, yes.
[01:56:15.416 --> 01:56:32.943]  Veterans for Peace has, if you're not a veteran, we have associate memberships, and we'd be glad to have anyone who shares our views and works to end nuclear warfare and bring peace to the world.
[01:56:34.873 --> 01:56:36.636]  Check that out if you're interested, Mike.
[01:56:36.676 --> 01:56:38.598]  And that's veteransforpeace.org, I believe.
[01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:39.619]  Yes, that's right.
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:40.861]  Veteransforpeace.org.
[01:56:40.921 --> 01:56:43.625]  We have a big, fat link to it on InfoWars.
[01:56:43.925 --> 01:56:45.808]  Mike, in the closing seconds, anything else?
[01:56:45.828 --> 01:56:47.170]  Yes, definitely.
[01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:48.752]  Don, thank you, Don.
[01:56:49.953 --> 01:57:00.822]  Alex, keep us up to speed with the Supreme Court ruling in Texas on the property tax issue, because that is such big news, and we've got to see that start a grassroots fire.
[01:57:00.842 --> 01:57:06.947]  Yeah, for those that don't know, about six months ago, the Texas Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional, but you haven't heard anything about it.
[01:57:06.987 --> 01:57:11.031]  Meanwhile, the federal Supreme Court's ruling, if private interests want your land, they take it.
[01:57:11.351 --> 01:57:14.153]  And the big, dirty secret is they're not giving people just compensation.
[01:57:14.454 --> 01:57:16.535]  That's the new London, Connecticut situation.
[01:57:16.555 --> 01:57:16.996]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:22.219]  We're going to come back and talk to Matt, David, and Dale as quickly as possible with our guest, Don Barling.
[01:57:22.239 --> 01:57:28.723]  Then we'll be joined in studio by combat journalist, combat documentary photographer, Alan Poe.
[01:57:28.803 --> 01:57:29.664]  You don't want to miss this.
[01:57:33.947 --> 01:57:38.169]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.984 --> 01:57:50.625]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.285 --> 01:57:52.346]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.066 --> 01:57:54.147]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.828 --> 01:57:55.628]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.389 --> 01:57:57.289]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.309 --> 01:58:01.772]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.153 --> 01:58:06.255]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.278 --> 01:58:17.223]  Well, Don Darling joins us, commander of a Navy submarine rescue ship, worked on nuclear submarines, you name it.
[01:58:17.944 --> 01:58:26.530]  Found out about this whole globalist operation and has been exposing it for years here locally in Austin with his TV show where he interviews people for Veterans for Peace.
[01:58:27.271 --> 01:58:28.952]  And coming up, another Veteran for Peace.
[01:58:29.012 --> 01:58:35.416]  It'll be Alan Pogue, combat journalist, photographer, Vietnam veteran, combat medic as well.
[01:58:35.937 --> 01:58:43.562]  And a bunch of other news I'm going to bring up for both these guests in the next hour who are both gracious enough to join us today.
[01:58:43.902 --> 01:58:47.385]  Quickly, Matt in Texas, you're on the air with Alex Jones and Don Darling.
[01:58:47.745 --> 01:58:48.426]  Hello, gentlemen.
[01:58:49.527 --> 01:58:55.472]  Over the weekend, here in Austin, we were treated with a psychological operation.
[01:58:55.492 --> 01:58:56.292]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:58:56.312 --> 01:59:06.721]  They knew it wasn't Ryerson, and once they knew it wasn't, they wouldn't even say what it was, because some girls saw some powder, some old fungus that grew on some quarters, and this shows we're just clinging to the government.
[01:59:06.781 --> 01:59:07.622]  Take our rights!
[01:59:08.042 --> 01:59:08.563]  Save us!
[01:59:08.623 --> 01:59:12.226]  And helicopters flying around, and people in biocontainment suits.
[01:59:12.566 --> 01:59:22.850]  Meanwhile, they're going to dump toxic waste, chemical weapons waste from the Delaware River and dump tens of thousands of tons of raw nerve gas in the Atlantic Ocean just a few miles offshore.
[01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:24.151]  But that isn't a crisis.
[01:59:24.191 --> 01:59:27.472]  Go to the government to save you because there's some dust on some corridors.
[01:59:27.792 --> 01:59:28.913]  Don, you want to comment on that?
[01:59:29.313 --> 01:59:33.695]  Yeah, it was just, to me, it was, as you say, a way to scare us.
[01:59:33.955 --> 01:59:35.755]  We're kept scared all the time.
[01:59:35.975 --> 01:59:40.177]  And by golly, we need to do something about that and wake up.
[01:59:40.697 --> 01:59:42.078]  Wake up to this illusion.
[01:59:43.422 --> 01:59:52.731]  Isn't this a great way for the biometrics companies to do away with paper and coin money, to put in biometrics?
[01:59:52.791 --> 01:59:54.733]  Well, they've got ads running in Europe and the U.S.
[01:59:54.753 --> 01:59:59.578]  that cash money is dirty, and now you try to go to the post office, and most post offices, they won't even take cash anymore.
[01:59:59.878 --> 02:00:02.120]  You've got to swipe a smart card to buy stamps.
[02:00:02.561 --> 02:00:05.844]  So everything is being phased over to controlling and tracking.
[02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:07.160]  That's all I had to say.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:09.141]  You know, I meant to mention, that's why I take calls.
[02:00:09.221 --> 02:00:11.441]  They bring up stuff I forget to talk about or stuff I didn't know.
[02:00:11.742 --> 02:00:12.962]  Just endless hysteria.
[02:00:13.002 --> 02:00:15.203]  We're under Al-Qaeda attack.
[02:00:15.643 --> 02:00:18.563]  The hysteria of some girls opening an old roll of quarters.
[02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:21.564]  I've done that and they get fungus and stuff growing on them.
[02:00:21.584 --> 02:00:23.705]  So there was some rust on these quarters.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.321]  And it's just all over.
[02:00:26.541 --> 02:00:27.282]  Matt, anything else?
[02:00:27.642 --> 02:00:27.942]  That's all.
[02:00:27.982 --> 02:00:28.643]  Thanks a lot.
[02:00:28.843 --> 02:00:29.183]  Thank you.
[02:00:29.223 --> 02:00:30.624]  Anything else about this?
[02:00:30.864 --> 02:00:36.408]  We have White House memos admitting, Ari Fleischer admitted before he left, that this was being done for hysteria.
[02:00:36.428 --> 02:00:39.350]  They're yelling, fire in the theater with all these fake terror alerts.
[02:00:40.351 --> 02:00:40.551]  Yeah.
[02:00:41.235 --> 02:00:45.796]  If we can just be kept scared, we'll continue to vote for who's saving us from it.
[02:00:46.296 --> 02:00:48.177]  I don't think Al-Qaeda has to do a thing.
[02:00:48.277 --> 02:00:54.438]  They've got us so scared, and our government's going along with it to keep us afraid.
[02:00:56.979 --> 02:01:00.960]  We've got to get some guts and do something about that.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:04.681]  A hundred years ago, 50 years ago, if you tried to scare Americans, they'd laugh at you.
[02:01:04.961 --> 02:01:06.261]  Home of the free, land of the brave.
[02:01:06.321 --> 02:01:08.902]  Now, home of the surveillance camera, land of the coward.
[02:01:10.557 --> 02:01:11.117]  I guess so.
[02:01:11.597 --> 02:01:12.837]  It's amazing, isn't it?
[02:01:12.958 --> 02:01:15.358]  But you know, in history, that's what milk and honey does.
[02:01:15.698 --> 02:01:21.079]  People are blessed because they have the right values, they become wealthy, then they become fat, dumb, and happy.
[02:01:22.959 --> 02:01:23.819]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:24.319 --> 02:01:27.440]  We don't pay much attention to history, unfortunately.
[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:30.020]  David Norton, quickly, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:01:30.681 --> 02:01:31.161]  Thank you.
[02:01:31.901 --> 02:01:33.321]  Thank you for your service, Don.
[02:01:34.941 --> 02:01:38.662]  Quickly, I believe that if we abolished...
[02:01:39.605 --> 02:01:48.038]  All our consumption of our current oil and energy resources, and we implemented the use of marijuana.
[02:01:48.999 --> 02:01:52.905]  We would just grow marijuana for all of our natural needs.
[02:01:54.133 --> 02:01:56.294]  We could be an independent nation again.
[02:01:56.334 --> 02:01:57.855]  Well, George Washington smoked it.
[02:01:57.935 --> 02:01:58.596]  I don't smoke it.
[02:01:58.636 --> 02:01:59.236]  I don't like it.
[02:01:59.276 --> 02:02:01.097]  We don't need to smoke it.
[02:02:01.157 --> 02:02:08.301]  I understand that the byproduct for clothing, for oils, it blows petrol chemicals away.
[02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:10.302]  It is a magic plant.
[02:02:10.342 --> 02:02:11.042]  Don, comments?
[02:02:11.643 --> 02:02:13.003]  Well, that's a good comment.
[02:02:13.144 --> 02:02:13.564]  I agree.
[02:02:13.584 --> 02:02:15.345]  I think we need...
[02:02:16.365 --> 02:02:19.226]  We need better assisting factors than alcohol.
[02:02:19.646 --> 02:02:21.207]  There are some available, too.
[02:02:22.667 --> 02:02:25.268]  But they're not as profitable as alcohol.
[02:02:25.288 --> 02:02:34.251]  Marijuana, in hundreds of major medical studies, is a wonder drug for a host of problems, from glaucoma to nausea.
[02:02:37.503 --> 02:02:43.048]  Yeah, I certainly would like to see it legitimized in some way.
[02:02:43.188 --> 02:02:50.094]  I'm not for legitimizing everything, but... Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.274 --> 02:02:54.698]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.859 --> 02:02:59.242]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:02:59.343 --> 02:03:00.624]  A New World Order.
[02:03:02.398 --> 02:03:06.620]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:13.604]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.744 --> 02:03:15.825]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.985 --> 02:03:26.430]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.751 --> 02:03:29.292]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then mind you,
[02:03:29.292 --> 02:03:32.095]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:45.347 --> 02:03:48.809]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:49.089 --> 02:03:52.591]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.671 --> 02:03:56.614]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.834 --> 02:04:02.997]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.397 --> 02:04:11.322]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.722 --> 02:04:17.066]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.226 --> 02:04:20.988]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.368 --> 02:04:23.230]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:25.451]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:30.955]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.995 --> 02:04:36.398]  Hit the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:43.464]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:44.264 --> 02:04:50.029]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:52.732]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[02:04:52.912 --> 02:04:55.514]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[02:04:55.694 --> 02:04:59.397]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[02:04:59.498 --> 02:05:04.562]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[02:05:04.782 --> 02:05:05.223]  We're good to go.
[02:05:27.483 --> 02:05:30.164]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:30.244 --> 02:05:31.565]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:17.902]  Well, I tell you, we're here getting used to my new studio.
[02:06:18.483 --> 02:06:19.744]  We just crammed two guys in here.
[02:06:19.764 --> 02:06:21.445]  We're going to redesign it next time you come in.
[02:06:21.465 --> 02:06:28.449]  It won't be quite as cramped here doing our two-camera shoot, also for the local TV show and for the viewers on the Internet.
[02:06:29.218 --> 02:06:36.632]  You know, a testament, though, to the fact, last hour, talking to Don Darling, a Navy veteran and a great patriot, a member of Veterans for Peace.
[02:06:37.765 --> 02:06:43.447]  A testament is the fact that 10, 12 years ago, plus I was a lot more wild-eyed then, that most people didn't listen to Alex Jones.
[02:06:43.507 --> 02:06:50.989]  Now almost everyone I talk to does know that something's wrong and is realizing that all of my radical pronouncements have a basis in reality.
[02:06:51.529 --> 02:07:00.252]  And another testament to that is InfoWars.com and, of course, PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com with millions and millions and millions.
[02:07:00.942 --> 02:07:01.962]  We're good to go.
[02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:28.871]  And Alan Pogue now joins us in studio, and I really can't do justice to all the things that Alan has done.
[02:07:28.911 --> 02:07:33.853]  He's a photojournalist, combat journalist, photo documentarian.
[02:07:33.913 --> 02:07:40.315]  He heads up an organization here in Texas and just takes some of the, frankly, most amazing photos I've seen.
[02:07:40.835 --> 02:07:45.437]  He's been in all these different dangerous war zones, and he'll be with us for The Balance Live.
[02:07:46.137 --> 02:08:06.168]  I guess the next 50 minutes that we have left, and of course we'll open the phones up later to take your calls, but he's here to personalize it and talk about his experiences in warfare, his experiences in Vietnam, his experiences covering things in Iraq and other areas, and some of his eyewitness accounts, and then bounce those ideas off back and forth with Don Darling and myself.
[02:08:06.228 --> 02:08:12.252]  And again, I'm so honored to have both of these men here, because patriotism is standing up for the founding documents.
[02:08:12.272 --> 02:08:14.433]  It's for standing up for the country and the people.
[02:08:14.893 --> 02:08:17.374]  And I will repeat what I said at the beginning of the last hour.
[02:08:17.755 --> 02:08:19.295]  I have seen him on C-SPAN twice.
[02:08:19.415 --> 02:08:20.476]  I've tried to interview him.
[02:08:21.116 --> 02:08:22.817]  He came on and refused to be interviewed.
[02:08:23.137 --> 02:08:26.859]  And that's one of the chief war statisticians and experts.
[02:08:28.857 --> 02:08:30.519]  Alan Pogue, thank you so much for coming in today.
[02:08:30.539 --> 02:08:32.360]  I'm glad to be here and talk about all this.
[02:08:50.692 --> 02:09:03.280]  I think the best way to do this is just tell us about Alan Pogue and your journey of awakening and then basically what your view of the war is right now and what you personally have viewed and then any of the websites or news sites where we can see some of your amazing photos.
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:11.084]  Well, I started off, I was a chaplain's assistant in Vietnam in 1967.
[02:09:11.865 --> 02:09:16.848]  But how I got to be a chaplain's assistant is that I was an altar boy in the Catholic Church for 13 years.
[02:09:18.061 --> 02:09:22.862]  And so I used to go to the chapel to read philosophy books when I was at Fort Carson, Colorado.
[02:09:22.942 --> 02:09:27.564]  And this captain chaplain came up to me and asked me to be his assistant.
[02:09:27.944 --> 02:09:29.424]  So I said, well, sure, I'd love to.
[02:09:30.224 --> 02:09:34.446]  So to make it short, I wound up in Vietnam as a chaplain's assistant.
[02:09:35.286 --> 02:09:39.707]  But I transferred into the medics because I was trained as a medic.
[02:09:41.128 --> 02:09:45.909]  And I was a combat medic in Vietnam in the 198th Wide Infantry around July.
[02:09:47.034 --> 02:09:52.976]  So that's where I learned that we didn't give a hoot and a holler about the Vietnamese people.
[02:09:53.116 --> 02:09:58.057]  We were bombing them, dropping napalm and Asian orange and shooting their water buffaloes.
[02:09:58.157 --> 02:09:59.878]  And we just didn't really care about them.
[02:10:00.438 --> 02:10:09.641]  But back when I was in the United States and I was a good Catholic altar boy, I was taught you weren't supposed to kill people.
[02:10:10.689 --> 02:10:13.932]  And even in a war situation, you don't kill civilians.
[02:10:14.073 --> 02:10:16.855]  And you don't do things that will kill them.
[02:10:18.017 --> 02:10:19.618]  And you know that it will.
[02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:21.220]  We just can't do that sort of stuff.
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:29.488]  And if we're going to go to Vietnam and save the Vietnamese people for democracy and this and that, we couldn't act the way we were acting.
[02:10:30.369 --> 02:10:33.252]  So there was a huge, huge difference between...
[02:10:34.085 --> 02:10:43.270]  What I was told the war was about and what was actually going on, and this has happened to a lot of soldiers, a lot of people besides myself, they just say, well, this isn't right.
[02:10:44.151 --> 02:10:56.878]  But our educational system, our educational system doesn't teach us to be critical thinkers, and it doesn't give us the alternative view that's going to allow us to critique our culture and our government.
[02:10:57.378 --> 02:11:01.300]  We're taught just to believe, just believe that everything is just fine.
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.705]  Isn't that similar to the Nazis or the Soviets when they were doing all these horrible things?
[02:11:05.785 --> 02:11:07.647]  Oh, we're doing it because they're terrorists.
[02:11:07.927 --> 02:11:09.028]  They're bad people.
[02:11:10.029 --> 02:11:17.638]  I've talked to friends and family and folks who were helicopter pilots in Vietnam, and they say that scene in full metal jacket where they're flying out to the front...
[02:11:18.178 --> 02:11:25.561]  And the guy shooting women, children, water buffaloes, and one of the Marines says, you know, how do you do it?
[02:11:25.601 --> 02:11:27.262]  How do you kill men, women, children?
[02:11:27.722 --> 02:11:32.003]  And he says, it's easy, you just don't lead the women so much, because they don't run as fast.
[02:11:32.343 --> 02:11:35.525]  So with the M60 machine gun, you don't lead them as much.
[02:11:36.005 --> 02:11:38.106]  And I talked to him, and I said, that's exactly how it was.
[02:11:38.146 --> 02:11:39.346]  We just killed everyone.
[02:11:40.146 --> 02:11:42.147]  And, I mean, can you speak to that?
[02:11:42.447 --> 02:11:46.689]  Well, yes, and that's why right now, fast forward to Iraq,
[02:11:47.503 --> 02:11:48.724]  It's a free fire zone.
[02:11:49.544 --> 02:11:55.327]  Right now, as they pull back with the ground troops, they intensify the air war.
[02:11:55.827 --> 02:11:59.989]  And so we're just bombing cities, bombing neighborhoods.
[02:12:00.009 --> 02:12:01.810]  Yeah, we're supposedly bringing them all this freedom.
[02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:10.655]  Meanwhile, it turns out every newspaper is fake, with CIA statisticians and PR firms hired, writing fake news articles, and they're telling us how it's all free.
[02:12:11.135 --> 02:12:13.376]  Well, for instance, they're using white phosphorus rounds.
[02:12:13.416 --> 02:12:14.136]  Now, I was in Vietnam.
[02:12:14.256 --> 02:12:17.957]  White phosphorus is so awful, once it gets on your skin, there's no way to put it out.
[02:12:17.977 --> 02:12:18.398]  It burns to the bone.
[02:12:37.074 --> 02:12:38.415]  And burn right through your body.
[02:12:38.755 --> 02:12:39.916]  You can't put water on it.
[02:12:40.036 --> 02:12:41.358]  You can't put sand on it.
[02:12:41.578 --> 02:12:44.020]  You can't do anything unless you have a chemical antidote.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:49.444]  And in Vietnam, it was used just for lazing the targets or identifying targets.
[02:12:49.464 --> 02:12:52.727]  That's always the excuse they use, okay?
[02:12:52.847 --> 02:12:58.471]  You can lob a smoke round out there, and it'll do exactly the same thing, but it won't kill people.
[02:12:59.192 --> 02:13:00.513]  It'll just put up a bunch of smoke.
[02:13:01.113 --> 02:13:02.895]  And they admit they're bombing major cities with it.
[02:13:03.459 --> 02:13:09.243]  Yes, and using improved napalm, you know, like improved because it sticks better to your skin.
[02:13:10.724 --> 02:13:13.586]  Using cluster bombs in populated areas.
[02:13:14.027 --> 02:13:23.173]  And as we all know, you drop, say, a 55-gallon barrel full of hand grenades, and 10% of those hand grenades don't go off is what it amounts to.
[02:13:23.254 --> 02:13:30.639]  So then you have the ground littered with these beer can-sized bomblets that any kid can pick up and blow themselves up.
[02:13:31.457 --> 02:13:33.540]  Well, you know, I talk to troops that come back.
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:37.786]  I've talked to WMPTs, many others, and they realize how serious it is.
[02:13:37.806 --> 02:13:44.234]  I mean, I've talked to Marine Corps captains who break down and cry on the show because, you know, of little babies dying in their arms.
[02:13:44.655 --> 02:13:46.778]  But then there's these armchair quarterbacks.
[02:13:46.818 --> 02:13:48.881]  And these guys, you can tell, they're not tough guys.
[02:13:49.341 --> 02:13:49.982]  We're good to go.
[02:14:09.344 --> 02:14:14.267]  I think they'd be puking their guts up if they were around rotting corpses of dead children, as you have been.
[02:14:14.467 --> 02:14:24.493]  Yes, and I wish they could walk through wards full of children, babies really, just a few months old, maybe a year old or two old, dying of leukemia.
[02:14:24.513 --> 02:14:31.738]  They're dying of leukemia because they've been inhaling and ingesting depleted uranium, which is another huge factor.
[02:14:31.758 --> 02:14:32.778]  But they're not human.
[02:14:32.818 --> 02:14:33.399]  They deserve it.
[02:14:33.439 --> 02:14:33.759]  Duh!
[02:14:34.497 --> 02:14:36.099]  Yeah, a three-year-old baby.
[02:14:36.199 --> 02:14:41.283]  I remember an Iraqi woman said, this child wasn't even born in 1990.
[02:14:41.904 --> 02:14:43.625]  Why is the U.S.
[02:14:43.765 --> 02:14:44.846]  killing it today?
[02:14:44.886 --> 02:14:46.848]  We've got to get them before they come get us.
[02:14:46.868 --> 02:14:50.692]  But then all the assessments show this is actually increasing real terrorism.
[02:14:51.152 --> 02:15:00.721]  Well, when your brothers and your sisters all get killed, and another thing, when your economy is in the dirt, and there's no hope, and there's no horizon, there's no future,
[02:15:01.434 --> 02:15:04.017]  And you can see who's creating this situation.
[02:15:04.678 --> 02:15:06.019]  Well, what are you going to do?
[02:15:06.039 --> 02:15:07.020]  You're going to pick up a gun.
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:08.141]  You're going to pick up a bomb.
[02:15:09.446 --> 02:15:11.847]  And then anybody who fights back is called a terrorist.
[02:15:12.207 --> 02:15:12.487]  Yes.
[02:15:12.627 --> 02:15:14.648]  I mean, in the past, in wars, it was called the enemy.
[02:15:14.668 --> 02:15:18.549]  You at least said, but no, no, now, no, you're going to take all this.
[02:15:19.130 --> 02:15:28.093]  And so the logic is, if there's no one in Iraq to be trusted, and there's no one worth saving, then we're not there to save anyone.
[02:15:28.293 --> 02:15:29.913]  I mean, there's a huge contradiction.
[02:15:30.474 --> 02:15:36.996]  If none of these Arabs are even capable of loving democracy and all of this stuff,
[02:15:38.268 --> 02:15:44.951]  Well, then, that's no reason either, because they said after there were no weapons of mass destruction found, then it was to get rid of Saddam.
[02:15:44.971 --> 02:15:47.752]  Well, he got rid of Saddam, and so what have we got?
[02:15:48.012 --> 02:15:50.693]  Well, you've got 25 million Iraqis.
[02:15:50.773 --> 02:15:55.114]  Well, if not one of them can be trusted... There's 22.5 million now.
[02:15:55.154 --> 02:15:55.994]  Quite a few have died.
[02:15:56.035 --> 02:15:57.255]  Yes, quite a few have died.
[02:15:58.012 --> 02:16:03.533]  I mean, people forget we were killing 5,000 a month from 1991 until 2003.
[02:16:05.254 --> 02:16:18.096]  And now that's all accelerated, but the first official act by Bremer was to not let any statistics of cancer, deaths, automobile accidents, all the official numbers that even third world countries keep, that's not allowed to be released now.
[02:16:18.356 --> 02:16:21.197]  I talked to a woman Iraqi doctor when I was in Kuwait.
[02:16:21.986 --> 02:16:28.718]  And she said that if any doctor released information like that, they'd find themselves herding sheep in the desert.
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:30.722]  They were told bluntly.
[02:16:31.573 --> 02:16:34.015]  Oh, but it's a free society over there now.
[02:16:34.035 --> 02:16:35.456]  You know, you've been over there.
[02:16:35.476 --> 02:16:40.099]  You've got more courage than I do, because I'll fight and die if I need to be for this country, but I've got to stay here with my family.
[02:16:40.899 --> 02:16:42.600]  Alan Pogue, I mean, you go all over the world.
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:45.702]  I mean, I remember you before the war being there, during the war being there.
[02:16:45.722 --> 02:16:47.344]  I mean, you really go there.
[02:16:47.364 --> 02:16:49.465]  I mean, you get the sight seconds after they were bombed.
[02:16:49.485 --> 02:16:52.247]  You've got the smoke coming out of the heaps with the dead families.
[02:16:53.268 --> 02:16:54.728]  You're over there breathing the D.U.
[02:16:54.889 --> 02:16:58.931]  I mean, what made you commit to go risk your life to bring this information up?
[02:16:59.332 --> 02:17:01.313]  I think it's because when I went to Vietnam,
[02:17:02.453 --> 02:17:19.641]  Like a lot of other soldiers, I really did believe, and I still do believe in something that's even deeper than patriotism, and that is that humanity, our shared humanity, every human being all over the world, we're basically the same.
[02:17:20.162 --> 02:17:22.683]  So you're there as a soldier for truth and humanity?
[02:17:22.923 --> 02:17:26.344]  Yes, and I think that's the bedrock of it all.
[02:17:26.825 --> 02:17:29.706]  Now, we're sold a lot of propaganda and a lot of division.
[02:17:30.373 --> 02:17:39.046]  But as long as we accept these divisions, then we're just fighting among ourselves while the people that are reaping the benefits are driving their Lexus down the street.
[02:17:39.066 --> 02:17:41.269]  And they don't have their kids in the you-know-what.
[02:17:41.610 --> 02:17:42.351]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:42.371 --> 02:17:42.812]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.788 --> 02:17:47.270]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:17:47.610 --> 02:17:51.555]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:17:51.936 --> 02:17:55.460]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:17:55.841 --> 02:17:59.405]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[02:17:59.806 --> 02:18:04.652]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:18:04.972 --> 02:18:10.777]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:18:11.077 --> 02:18:17.222]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:18:17.562 --> 02:18:23.327]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:18:23.747 --> 02:18:24.928]  TriVortex is amazing.
[02:18:25.249 --> 02:18:26.370]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:18:26.470 --> 02:18:31.874]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[02:18:32.075 --> 02:18:35.538]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[02:18:35.818 --> 02:18:37.119]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[02:18:37.159 --> 02:18:37.439]  That's 619-884-1455.
[02:18:44.305 --> 02:18:50.509]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:50.969 --> 02:18:58.754]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:59.094 --> 02:19:06.959]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:07.259 --> 02:19:12.022]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:12.342 --> 02:19:17.066]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:17.566 --> 02:19:21.429]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:19:21.929 --> 02:19:22.930]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:23.010 --> 02:19:27.093]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:19:27.513 --> 02:19:31.897]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:19:32.417 --> 02:19:34.939]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:19:35.379 --> 02:19:35.720]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[02:19:43.911 --> 02:19:44.531]  Hello, folks.
[02:19:44.631 --> 02:19:45.532]  Alex Jones here.
[02:19:45.672 --> 02:19:49.794]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:52.796]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:52.876 --> 02:19:59.579]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:19:59.759 --> 02:20:02.781]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:02.981 --> 02:20:05.362]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:05.502 --> 02:20:10.225]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:20:10.385 --> 02:20:15.670]  Try halo-methanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:20:15.850 --> 02:20:16.611]  MTBE.
[02:20:16.811 --> 02:20:17.631]  Radon-222.
[02:20:17.732 --> 02:20:19.713]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:20:19.853 --> 02:20:20.694]  Even nitrates.
[02:20:20.974 --> 02:20:24.978]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:20:25.138 --> 02:20:32.805]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803.
[02:20:35.247 --> 02:20:35.927]  We're good to go.
[02:21:04.448 --> 02:21:05.049]  We're good to go.
[02:21:25.245 --> 02:21:25.625]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[02:21:48.795 --> 02:21:49.256]  Don't worry.
[02:21:49.757 --> 02:21:51.279]  This show is documented.
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:54.544]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.965 --> 02:21:58.410]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:21:58.430 --> 02:21:59.512]  All right, we're back live.
[02:21:59.552 --> 02:22:01.094]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:01.195 --> 02:22:03.799]  Alan Hogue, combat journalist, Medic Vietnam.
[02:22:04.634 --> 02:22:07.356]  And he's been to Haiti, he's been to just everywhere.
[02:22:07.376 --> 02:22:08.417]  He was just in New Orleans.
[02:22:09.157 --> 02:22:20.925]  And we're also, of course, joined by Don Darling, who was a commander of a submarine rescue ship in the Med, worked on nuclear reactors and subs, targeted, you name it, the whole nine yards.
[02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:21.726]  He's here with us.
[02:22:22.286 --> 02:22:24.408]  Don, you were chomping at the bit right before I went to break.
[02:22:24.748 --> 02:22:29.431]  Yeah, I just wanted to point out, earlier we were talking about Mapmakers of Reality.
[02:22:29.827 --> 02:22:33.148]  Well, Alan here is an example of a mapmaker of reality.
[02:22:33.208 --> 02:22:38.749]  He's trying to make a reality that we can trust and react to instead of propaganda.
[02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.869]  I agree.
[02:22:40.189 --> 02:22:47.690]  Well, I was in Haiti just after Aristide was kidnapped and dumped in the Central African Republic.
[02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:49.991]  With Special Forces soldiers guarding his replacement.
[02:22:50.031 --> 02:22:50.771]  It was on TV.
[02:22:51.391 --> 02:22:57.772]  And I went there and I went to Cap-Haitien, which is the northwestern city, the second largest,
[02:22:58.513 --> 02:23:02.957]  And I spoke with the French troops that were in charge, because this was a French-American operation.
[02:23:02.977 --> 02:23:06.200]  They were totally together on getting rid of Aristide.
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:11.364]  And I talked to the French commander, and I said, well, what about these rebel soldiers we hear about?
[02:23:11.444 --> 02:23:15.187]  And he told me, to my face, there are no more rebel soldiers.
[02:23:16.168 --> 02:23:20.512]  And, of course, I asked him, this question was a setup, because I knew that there were.
[02:23:20.572 --> 02:23:22.053]  I said, oh, as a matter of fact,
[02:23:23.255 --> 02:23:31.744]  I just saw and photographed 130 heavily armed rebel soldiers in the middle of Capetian at 22 O.P.
[02:23:31.804 --> 02:23:35.167]  Street, and you can go over and talk to them right now if you want to.
[02:23:35.848 --> 02:23:43.216]  He says, no, we have no intention of talking to these so-called rebels, and we have no intention of disarming them.
[02:23:44.105 --> 02:23:49.828]  So what the United States forces and the French forces were doing were enabling the rebels.
[02:23:49.968 --> 02:23:56.671]  Oh yeah, they go hire the rebels or fund them and then say, oh look, rebels have taken over, we've got to go deal with it.
[02:23:56.691 --> 02:23:59.612]  I mean, it's the same story, problem, reaction, solution.
[02:24:00.232 --> 02:24:04.014]  CIA overthrows time and time and time again.
[02:24:04.654 --> 02:24:12.918]  But the main thing about these rebels is they were kidnapping people, mostly government officials, but also I talked to a high school principal they had kidnapped.
[02:24:13.690 --> 02:24:17.772]  They put 27 people into a shipping container and tossed it into the ocean.
[02:24:18.593 --> 02:24:23.336]  And they had the principal of the high school, and they said if they can't come up with a ransom, they're going to kill them.
[02:24:23.836 --> 02:24:28.238]  So his teacher's association had to come up with the money to spring the principal.
[02:24:28.779 --> 02:24:32.281]  Now, this is not under the noses of the French military.
[02:24:32.321 --> 02:24:34.662]  This is the French military not giving a damn.
[02:24:35.162 --> 02:24:36.363]  Oh, it's more than that, Alan.
[02:24:36.383 --> 02:24:36.823]  You know that.
[02:24:36.863 --> 02:24:38.064]  Well, it goes into...
[02:24:41.569 --> 02:25:04.083]  The International Republican Institute and the National Endowment for Democracy, who helped fund training these troops, they sent millions of dollars into Haiti to organize opposition, to create what they call the Democratic Convergence, which was really what they call the group of 184, 184 factory owners, under the leadership of Andy Appaid,
[02:25:08.812 --> 02:25:10.434]  Who really calls all the shots.
[02:25:10.454 --> 02:25:14.017]  So they went and hired a bunch of thugs to overthrow things and then they come swooping to the rescue.
[02:25:14.417 --> 02:25:21.363]  So that Aristide couldn't do something like raise the minimum wage from 34 cents an hour to 50 cents an hour.
[02:25:21.944 --> 02:25:24.086]  Because that would be horrible if they made 50 cents an hour.
[02:25:24.628 --> 02:25:26.029]  The people that work in these sweatshops.
[02:25:26.430 --> 02:25:31.534]  But then we hear on the news that we're swooping in to help deal with the rebels when the rebels are clearly on the payroll.
[02:25:32.074 --> 02:25:32.534]  Oh, right.
[02:25:32.634 --> 02:25:36.938]  And the rebels they're talking about in that case, they're talking about gangs.
[02:25:37.398 --> 02:25:39.400]  And they say there are gangs in the slums.
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:42.683]  Well, there are armed people in the slums.
[02:25:42.723 --> 02:25:43.283]  That's true.
[02:25:43.583 --> 02:25:45.645]  Because if they weren't armed, they would be shot.
[02:25:45.885 --> 02:25:47.106]  And they know that's true.
[02:25:47.747 --> 02:25:48.767]  So they have guns.
[02:25:48.887 --> 02:25:49.368]  That's right.
[02:25:50.933 --> 02:25:55.015]  And the rebels, on the other hand, are a paramilitary force.
[02:25:55.095 --> 02:25:56.236]  They have uniforms.
[02:25:56.416 --> 02:25:58.037]  They have M16s.
[02:25:58.718 --> 02:26:00.259]  And they were shipped over.
[02:26:00.859 --> 02:26:07.664]  And so what they're trying to do is say anyone who is capable of protecting themselves is a threat.
[02:26:07.884 --> 02:26:09.004]  Well, it's like a New Orleans.
[02:26:09.024 --> 02:26:14.328]  Instead of bringing in food and water, the feds come out even to wealthy areas and start confiscating people's guns.
[02:26:15.385 --> 02:26:18.586]  Yeah, it's really bizarre.
[02:26:18.666 --> 02:26:26.708]  When I was just in New Orleans, and the progress of helping people has been so painfully slow.
[02:26:28.029 --> 02:26:36.051]  What I saw was that spontaneous groups, there's a group called Common Ground, sprung up almost immediately, and with the help of Veterans for Peace,
[02:26:36.927 --> 02:26:38.789]  Well, they're continuing to do it, but the problem is...
[02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:06.792]  Where are the massive supplies from FEMA?
[02:27:06.892 --> 02:27:13.336]  Well, we know the $200 billion that's going to be handed out, it's mainly going to be given to Halliburton and others, and it's going to be a big development project.
[02:27:13.356 --> 02:27:14.977]  They're not even helping the people.
[02:27:15.037 --> 02:27:16.798]  The message is, get out of New Orleans.
[02:27:16.978 --> 02:27:22.101]  And there's where we see the connection between domestic policy and international policy and foreign policy.
[02:27:22.301 --> 02:27:23.242]  It's the same policy.
[02:27:23.582 --> 02:27:24.883]  Well, I call it looting, Alan.
[02:27:25.003 --> 02:27:25.243]  Yes.
[02:27:25.783 --> 02:27:26.364]  Yeah, it's...
[02:27:27.142 --> 02:27:32.427]  Paying people $3,000 in New Orleans to put a piece of blue plastic on top of somebody's house.
[02:27:32.528 --> 02:27:33.228]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.268 --> 02:27:34.069]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.951 --> 02:27:36.852]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.352 --> 02:27:38.954]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.875 --> 02:27:42.578]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.452 --> 02:27:50.113]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[02:27:50.333 --> 02:27:52.114]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[02:27:52.294 --> 02:27:56.295]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[02:27:56.515 --> 02:27:57.875]  Now there's STEM Enhance.
[02:27:58.276 --> 02:28:02.897]  STEM Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.
[02:28:03.137 --> 02:28:08.879]  STEM Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[02:28:09.119 --> 02:28:15.262]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body.
[02:28:15.422 --> 02:28:20.564]  Like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[02:28:20.845 --> 02:28:30.349]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days to an improvement in overall health.
[02:28:30.669 --> 02:28:36.057]  Not available in stores, Stem Enhance is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[02:28:36.117 --> 02:28:36.377]  That's 860-567-7744.
[02:28:45.891 --> 02:28:53.414]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.694 --> 02:29:06.620]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.940 --> 02:29:10.262]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.603 --> 02:29:21.070]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:21.350 --> 02:29:21.850]  That's right.
[02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:29.135]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.435 --> 02:29:38.183]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.223 --> 02:29:38.683]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:50.631]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:29:50.912 --> 02:29:54.493]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:29:54.633 --> 02:30:02.775]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:30:03.015 --> 02:30:08.637]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:30:08.957 --> 02:30:14.201]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:30:14.461 --> 02:30:16.543]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[02:30:16.803 --> 02:30:28.972]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:30:29.192 --> 02:30:33.613]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:30:33.833 --> 02:30:34.794]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:34.974 --> 02:30:36.594]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:30:36.714 --> 02:30:38.515]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:30:38.755 --> 02:30:39.235]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:30:39.275 --> 02:30:39.455]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:30:56.992 --> 02:31:02.260]  Well, we've got Alan Pogue in studio with us, and also we've got Mr. Darling, Don Darling.
[02:31:02.921 --> 02:31:04.043]  Both great Austinites.
[02:31:05.709 --> 02:31:09.370]  Continuing with our discussion, your calls are coming up.
[02:31:09.390 --> 02:31:16.073]  1-800-259-9231 if it's about the war, if it's about the upcoming war with Iran, if it's about Bush declaring himself emperor.
[02:31:16.093 --> 02:31:20.595]  I mean, that's openly now being written about, not just by us in the alternative news, but it's a big discussion.
[02:31:20.935 --> 02:31:22.995]  Now, the torture camps, all of it.
[02:31:23.496 --> 02:31:27.737]  But I've just got a few bullet point questions for both of you gentlemen.
[02:31:28.938 --> 02:31:30.298]  First off, though, let's plug some things.
[02:31:30.358 --> 02:31:31.279]  Veteransforpeace.org.
[02:31:33.115 --> 02:31:35.881]  There's Alan Pogue's website, which is excellent.
[02:31:35.921 --> 02:31:39.589]  Go look at these incredible photos all over the world of the carnage, the reality.
[02:31:39.949 --> 02:31:42.855]  And it's documentaryphotos.com.
[02:31:42.915 --> 02:31:44.098]  Documentaryphotos.com.
[02:31:46.145 --> 02:32:05.778]  Documentaryphotographs.com Documentaryphotographs.com And if we don't have it, we'll get a big fat link on Infowars.com to Documentaryphotographs.com Of all the things you've heard Alan talk about in the last 20-30 minutes or so, Don Darling, any comments or any observations?
[02:32:06.499 --> 02:32:12.963]  Yeah, I'd like to talk about, for Alan and I, to cover conflict resolution issues.
[02:32:14.131 --> 02:32:18.894]  And we need alternatives to war to resolve conflicts.
[02:32:19.334 --> 02:32:24.738]  Right now, war is the conflict resolution way that this country operates.
[02:32:25.278 --> 02:32:36.265]  And we're still in a conflict with an imaginary opponent, I guess, with the weapons of the Cold War to carry on.
[02:32:36.305 --> 02:32:39.807]  We're still manufacturing those things at great profit to...
[02:32:41.127 --> 02:32:42.248]  To the manufacturers.
[02:32:42.448 --> 02:32:45.729]  Well, I mean, that's what our economy's gone other than that.
[02:32:45.769 --> 02:32:48.911]  And then even most of the profits from it don't even go to the American people.
[02:32:48.931 --> 02:32:52.032]  They're even outsourcing now, what, half of the defense contracting.
[02:32:53.593 --> 02:32:55.634]  Well, that's what Eisenhower warned us against.
[02:32:55.734 --> 02:32:59.036]  And people keep referring to the military-industrial complex.
[02:32:59.056 --> 02:32:59.896]  Farewell address.
[02:33:00.296 --> 02:33:02.697]  And if people would just listen to that.
[02:33:02.797 --> 02:33:04.278]  And also Martin Luther King.
[02:33:05.279 --> 02:33:10.201]  A lot of effort has been put into dumbing down Martin Luther King's message.
[02:33:10.814 --> 02:33:14.615]  To say that he just wanted us all to, you know, hug one another and be friendly.
[02:33:15.116 --> 02:33:19.657]  Martin Luther King's last major address said the same thing Eisenhower's did.
[02:33:19.737 --> 02:33:23.278]  His Riverside Baptist Church... It was anti-war, and that's why the government killed him.
[02:33:23.639 --> 02:33:25.539]  Yeah, he spoke directly to it.
[02:33:25.579 --> 02:33:30.721]  He said, you know, that... It's kind of like all the guns and butter rhetoric back in the late 60s.
[02:33:30.741 --> 02:33:31.761]  Well, here's an example.
[02:33:31.941 --> 02:33:36.103]  Whenever I go down to UT psychology department or engineering, getting a tour or whatever, I've got friends down there.
[02:33:37.057 --> 02:33:40.440]  They'll have on the door of each laboratory, you know, where it's professors, not even classes.
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:43.342]  And that's, most of it's just professors working for the government.
[02:33:43.362 --> 02:33:45.143]  They're not even teaching students, young people.
[02:33:45.723 --> 02:33:51.147]  And in the psychology department, it was DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, Defense Department, just for psychology.
[02:33:51.167 --> 02:33:56.571]  And I said to the guy who works up there, I said, he said, oh yeah, most of it is government and most of that is Defense Department.
[02:33:57.272 --> 02:34:01.535]  And right there is they control everything that's being said and done because they control all the research.
[02:34:02.242 --> 02:34:08.268]  Well, that's like USAID going to countries and saying, here, would you like to borrow this money?
[02:34:08.849 --> 02:34:11.672]  And then once they borrow it, then they tell them who they can loan it to.
[02:34:11.692 --> 02:34:13.714]  Well, you can't loan it to these people.
[02:34:13.794 --> 02:34:17.818]  Well, they say you've got to hire Halliburton to run your water system, and then they rip everybody off.
[02:34:18.536 --> 02:34:22.219]  And so that's how they control politics, by controlling the money.
[02:34:22.599 --> 02:34:24.340]  Then they take aid money and give it to themselves.
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:27.762]  This foreign aid, most of it's going right back to select globalist corporations.
[02:34:28.022 --> 02:34:35.968]  Well, yes, as they have to buy the products, and have to buy them from American manufacturers, or at least those who they're directed to buy it from.
[02:34:36.868 --> 02:34:41.071]  And that was true of Iraq as the best example.
[02:34:41.672 --> 02:34:45.534]  You know, you can't... They're getting people from Sri Lanka to come and work in Iraq.
[02:34:45.554 --> 02:34:46.595]  You know, they have...
[02:34:47.430 --> 02:34:48.691]  The 22 million Iraqis.
[02:34:48.711 --> 02:34:50.292]  They don't need people from Sri Lanka.
[02:34:51.193 --> 02:34:53.514]  But they can abuse them even more.
[02:34:54.435 --> 02:34:56.577]  I mean, it's just like here, the Bracero Program.
[02:34:56.597 --> 02:34:57.998]  They're trying to reintroduce that.
[02:34:58.878 --> 02:35:01.440]  On the one hand, they're saying, we're going to close the borders.
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:03.181]  We want to build these iron fences.
[02:35:03.261 --> 02:35:05.883]  On the other hand, they say, no, we want to bring in immigrant labor.
[02:35:06.123 --> 02:35:11.547]  Really, what they're going to do is legalize it and then just basically control it.
[02:35:12.428 --> 02:35:13.589]  It's a total legalization.
[02:35:13.629 --> 02:35:13.969]  That's what's...
[02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:15.049]  That's what's happening.
[02:35:15.069 --> 02:35:17.730]  In fact, I've talked to police that have been told this, and I've read the federal documents.
[02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:18.490]  You're absolutely right.
[02:35:19.250 --> 02:35:22.171]  And then some conservatives go, oh, yeah, let's get this guest worker program.
[02:35:22.471 --> 02:35:27.712]  No, it just basically, yeah, what do they call the little slave plantations down in Mexico?
[02:35:27.732 --> 02:35:29.393]  Oh, the Aquila Dora plant.
[02:35:29.513 --> 02:35:30.093]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:30.273 --> 02:35:34.774]  Yeah, you get people in there working for a couple hundred dollars a month and living in hovels.
[02:35:35.698 --> 02:35:38.640]  And they were living better down in the interior when they were corn farmers.
[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:40.341]  Yeah, they come to the border.
[02:35:40.361 --> 02:35:44.764]  They call them Maquilador's Mountains of Gold because they think they're going to come to the border and get a great job.
[02:35:45.185 --> 02:35:47.266]  But there are ten people for every available job.
[02:35:48.006 --> 02:35:51.509]  And so they have to accept whatever wages they can get.
[02:35:51.869 --> 02:36:00.195]  I talked to one woman whose husband was making more money than she was, and he was one of those guys that will wash your window at an intersection whether you like it or not.
[02:36:00.615 --> 02:36:03.597]  And he was making more money than she was working in an electronics plant.
[02:36:04.057 --> 02:36:06.039]  Meanwhile, it displaces American workers.
[02:36:06.079 --> 02:36:12.744]  By the way, under the, quote, UN biosphere down in Costa Maya, ten years ago, they pushed everybody off their land.
[02:36:12.764 --> 02:36:17.588]  I mean, they forcibly taped their land, and then they forced them up to Mexico City as a staging point.
[02:36:17.608 --> 02:36:18.548]  Now, 30 million people.
[02:36:18.568 --> 02:36:25.234]  There's a reason it's 30 million from 15 million 12 years ago, because they're forcing them all up here, and it is diabolical.
[02:36:25.294 --> 02:36:25.434]  Now...
[02:36:26.267 --> 02:36:29.129]  Before we go to some calls, I want to bring up torture.
[02:36:30.970 --> 02:36:34.471]  Even before we do that, there's so much I want to bring up, and we'll run out of time in the next 22 minutes.
[02:36:35.132 --> 02:36:36.573]  Alan, you've been all over the world.
[02:36:37.213 --> 02:36:46.158]  Tell us some of the horrors, and the photographs are on your website, but tell us some of the horrors that you have personally witnessed with these families in different countries that you photographed.
[02:36:47.198 --> 02:36:52.241]  Well, most of the horrors that I've seen were either imposed neglect,
[02:36:53.104 --> 02:37:04.991]  So that people don't have food, they don't have medicine, they can't have access to medical care, and this is all created on purpose.
[02:37:10.111 --> 02:37:16.514]  The United States knew exactly what would happen when they bombed the sewage treatment plants and water treatment plants of Iraq.
[02:37:16.654 --> 02:37:19.855]  They knew they projected 170,000 deaths in the first year.
[02:37:19.915 --> 02:37:21.776]  And those are not military targets.
[02:37:21.836 --> 02:37:23.797]  In fact, under international treaties, that's illegal.
[02:37:24.157 --> 02:37:25.578]  No, it's totally illegal.
[02:37:26.158 --> 02:37:28.119]  And it was all unknown.
[02:37:28.159 --> 02:37:33.381]  And then the sanctions were designed so that the harm couldn't be alleviated.
[02:37:34.248 --> 02:37:35.109]  It's genocide.
[02:37:35.530 --> 02:37:35.930]  It is.
[02:37:36.171 --> 02:37:40.055]  And then in Vietnam, well, where to start?
[02:37:40.876 --> 02:37:47.024]  Anything from mindlessly shooting someone's water buffalo, which is the center of their personal economy.
[02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:50.360]  And dropping all the Agent Orange on them.
[02:37:50.660 --> 02:37:56.005]  And that's the other good example of dropping Agent Orange on the Vietnamese, but you're dropping it on your own soldiers.
[02:37:56.225 --> 02:37:57.886]  Massive birth defects, just like DU.
[02:37:58.147 --> 02:37:59.288]  Just like DU.
[02:37:59.628 --> 02:38:04.732]  And then in the same, they denied compensation to U.S.
[02:38:05.233 --> 02:38:10.998]  soldiers that were hurt by Agent Orange, and they're denying compensation to psychological effects now.
[02:38:11.098 --> 02:38:14.544]  You've been unembedded over in Iraq.
[02:38:14.584 --> 02:38:16.527]  I mean, not just talking to the Iraqis.
[02:38:16.547 --> 02:38:18.891]  When you talk to the troops, you go, hey, DU's deadly.
[02:38:19.132 --> 02:38:19.833]  Do you know about that?
[02:38:19.873 --> 02:38:20.795]  I mean, have you talked to them?
[02:38:21.356 --> 02:38:23.239]  Well, I've talked to the Marines in...
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:32.502]  In Haiti, and the sad thing is, these guys, just like in Vietnam, they don't know why they're there.
[02:38:32.582 --> 02:38:33.822]  They don't know what they're doing.
[02:38:34.202 --> 02:38:35.083]  Blue collar, mainly?
[02:38:35.603 --> 02:38:43.645]  Yes, the guy from Dallas I talked to, he was at the main prison in Port-au-Prince, and they're running it just like Albuquerque.
[02:38:44.508 --> 02:38:45.589]  They're arresting people.
[02:38:45.989 --> 02:38:47.290]  They won't give their names out.
[02:38:47.310 --> 02:38:48.190]  You go to the prison.
[02:38:48.210 --> 02:38:49.251]  They won't say who's there.
[02:38:50.012 --> 02:38:51.613]  They claim that it's a Haitian prison.
[02:38:51.633 --> 02:39:01.999]  You go inside, and there's a Marine with a shirt off sitting at the desk, calling the shots, running the prison, and the Haitian military are just there to take orders.
[02:39:02.119 --> 02:39:04.501]  That guy's going to come back here and be a cop.
[02:39:04.561 --> 02:39:05.001]  Probably.
[02:39:05.021 --> 02:39:07.323]  We're in deep trouble.
[02:39:08.063 --> 02:39:09.424]  It's coming home, believe me.
[02:39:09.972 --> 02:39:11.593]  Well, that attitude... What about it coming home?
[02:39:11.653 --> 02:39:20.999]  Because I'm sure you've heard, you guys are tuned in, mainstream news articles about camps, Senate chairmen saying we need to start arresting fifth columnists who are against the war.
[02:39:21.059 --> 02:39:23.300]  They're really all, these peace people are really all Al Qaeda.
[02:39:23.621 --> 02:39:25.982]  Bush saying he's above the law, we can torture children.
[02:39:26.002 --> 02:39:27.483]  I mean, I'm sure you've been hearing all this.
[02:39:27.523 --> 02:39:28.043]  Oh, yes.
[02:39:28.323 --> 02:39:29.044]  What's your take on it?
[02:39:29.564 --> 02:39:31.185]  I mean, it's like a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:39:32.026 --> 02:39:32.226]  Well...
[02:39:32.947 --> 02:39:37.994]  Power, the people who want power, they just want it for its own ends.
[02:39:38.535 --> 02:39:40.197]  They have no reason.
[02:39:40.517 --> 02:39:42.500]  There's no good that they want to create.
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:43.782]  There's nothing they want to do.
[02:39:44.343 --> 02:39:48.068]  The ultimate power is the ability to kill people.
[02:39:48.971 --> 02:39:50.333]  And have no retribution.
[02:39:50.373 --> 02:39:51.894]  That's what O'Brien told Winston in 1984.
[02:39:52.075 --> 02:39:53.776]  He said, why are you torturing me?
[02:39:53.816 --> 02:39:55.138]  He goes, because this is what we do, buddy.
[02:39:55.158 --> 02:39:57.100]  This is why we're in control, because we like it.
[02:39:58.261 --> 02:40:00.964]  I remember, you know, we're creating jobs.
[02:40:01.465 --> 02:40:04.248]  And the jobs we're creating are harmful.
[02:40:05.492 --> 02:40:08.376]  We could use the same money, same people.
[02:40:09.157 --> 02:40:12.821]  We could be building roads in schools and delivering health care.
[02:40:13.202 --> 02:40:18.469]  But instead of selling our roads off to the foreign corporations, it makes the UAE deal look tame.
[02:40:19.370 --> 02:40:21.092]  Don, darling, I want to get...
[02:40:22.754 --> 02:40:26.097]  Your take here, specifically about torture.
[02:40:26.498 --> 02:40:32.543]  I mean, you know, as a naval commander of a ship, submarine rescue craft, working in nuclear subs, being a patriot, doing all this.
[02:40:32.964 --> 02:40:36.067]  I mean, sometimes now, I'm like, am I reading what I'm reading?
[02:40:36.107 --> 02:40:37.328]  Am I believing what I'm seeing?
[02:40:37.788 --> 02:40:48.241]  When Alberto Gonzalez says in front of the Senate, I don't apologize for torture, and we're above the law, the president is the law, if we say it isn't torture, then it isn't torture.
[02:40:48.361 --> 02:40:56.771]  I mean, it's getting crazier and crazier and crazier, and it seems like on purpose they're trying to change our moral compass and tell us that...
[02:40:57.311 --> 02:41:01.054]  Well, about torture, I'm very much against torturing of people.
[02:41:01.074 --> 02:41:03.797]  I don't think it gets the results that they say it gets.
[02:41:24.778 --> 02:41:25.498]  It just turns me on.
[02:41:46.916 --> 02:41:48.937]  Because the real information was there.
[02:41:49.497 --> 02:41:52.859]  I mean, people were warning about the attacks on the Twin Towers.
[02:41:52.919 --> 02:41:57.703]  People, you know, the guys that flew the planes, some of them were trained in military bases.
[02:41:57.863 --> 02:42:03.066]  Oh, accidentally, the dean of the defense language school went public and said the government did it.
[02:42:03.486 --> 02:42:05.007]  Then I called him and I said, what do you mean?
[02:42:05.027 --> 02:42:07.169]  And his wife's like, get off the phone, you've been told not to talk.
[02:42:07.929 --> 02:42:12.492]  Now, he told the San Jose Mercury News the government, quote, did it.
[02:42:12.532 --> 02:42:14.513]  He didn't say we were forced to train them.
[02:42:14.873 --> 02:42:16.574]  Oh, yeah, that was four years ago.
[02:42:16.594 --> 02:42:17.355]  Never heard about it again.
[02:42:17.375 --> 02:42:20.877]  Why are we hearing, oh, they were trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[02:42:20.897 --> 02:42:22.297]  They were trained at the Defense Language School.
[02:42:22.698 --> 02:42:25.899]  Oh, I've interviewed the heads of the embassies who were told, let them back in.
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:28.381]  They're part of a secret government program, Alan.
[02:42:28.681 --> 02:42:30.902]  It isn't just they were accidentally trained at U.S.
[02:42:30.962 --> 02:42:31.342]  bases.
[02:42:31.563 --> 02:42:33.844]  We now know they thought they were taking part in drills.
[02:42:34.404 --> 02:42:35.305]  But the point of all that to me is...
[02:42:59.671 --> 02:43:07.120]  The reason for trying to get Google to hand over everybody's web searches... Get them for porn.
[02:43:07.841 --> 02:43:08.142]  This is...
[02:43:09.105 --> 02:43:10.186]  This is beside the point.
[02:43:10.226 --> 02:43:15.929]  This is another example of wanting total control simply because they want total control.
[02:43:15.949 --> 02:43:16.710]  And setting the precedent.
[02:43:17.010 --> 02:43:23.373]  Because the real information, the stuff that would stop terrorists, you don't get it that way.
[02:43:23.954 --> 02:43:34.340]  And as a matter of fact, as you point out, all of the markers that would have led any really good investigator to stop some of these actions, they were all there.
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:35.502]  Well, it's like Able Danger.
[02:43:35.582 --> 02:43:40.469]  Bush signed an order ordering the FBI and Defense Intel not to stop the, quote, hijackers.
[02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:43.333]  And so you have to think, it's just like the torture thing.
[02:43:43.353 --> 02:43:48.742]  I mean, it's just simply desiring the ability to create more terror.
[02:43:49.492 --> 02:43:51.113]  Yeah, they're terrorizing the public.
[02:43:51.134 --> 02:43:55.317]  That's the schizophrenia or the dual personality.
[02:43:55.577 --> 02:44:00.942]  Saddam's bad, we claim he tortures, but then we're going to go set up actual rape rooms and it's okay.
[02:44:01.402 --> 02:44:08.588]  Well, in Iraq, of course, the United States have sold him all of the nerve gas, the anthrax, the botulism,
[02:44:09.088 --> 02:44:16.634]  And not only that, we supplied him with 60 intelligence officers and the aerial satellite information to know exactly where to use it.
[02:44:16.995 --> 02:44:19.957]  And when he did use it, that was everyone celebrated.
[02:44:20.658 --> 02:44:24.941]  And so now they come back years later and say, oh, we can't... We've never been at war with East Asia.
[02:44:25.001 --> 02:44:26.803]  Tomorrow, we've always been at war with East Asia.
[02:44:28.024 --> 02:44:31.867]  Don Darling, I mean, Alan's making incredibly important points here.
[02:44:32.007 --> 02:44:35.210]  The question is, can the general public, some of them out there, interface with this?
[02:44:35.390 --> 02:44:36.811]  Because we're told patriotism...
[02:44:37.031 --> 02:44:37.691]  And it's nothing new.
[02:45:06.796 --> 02:45:10.517]  That's been going on in the military for centuries, millennia probably.
[02:45:11.417 --> 02:45:16.478]  One thing I wonder about, we bring up all these points of what's going on that's wrong.
[02:45:16.538 --> 02:45:17.018]  Solutions.
[02:45:17.359 --> 02:45:18.999]  And what are the solutions here?
[02:45:20.099 --> 02:45:27.221]  I think that most people who are bringing up all the points about what's wrong are on the right track.
[02:45:28.021 --> 02:45:32.022]  But what are we suggesting to the people who are listening to us now?
[02:45:32.042 --> 02:45:36.143]  Are we suggesting that you write letters to your congressmen and your senators who
[02:45:36.894 --> 02:45:40.637]  Are probably, many of them, in on the things we're doing.
[02:45:40.657 --> 02:45:41.978]  Yeah, they put it in a circular file.
[02:45:42.098 --> 02:45:43.059]  What's our options?
[02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:44.520]  I want to know.
[02:45:44.880 --> 02:45:45.681]  What can we do?
[02:45:45.701 --> 02:45:55.589]  Is there enough representative democracy left that we can, in effect, change through the democratic process in our government?
[02:45:55.609 --> 02:45:56.449]  Well, I think we are.
[02:45:56.990 --> 02:46:01.353]  I mean, if we weren't exposing all this, if you and Alan weren't doing what you're doing, it'd be much worse right now.
[02:46:01.373 --> 02:46:02.194]  Do you have any doubt, gentlemen?
[02:46:02.214 --> 02:46:02.414]  Oh, yes.
[02:46:02.834 --> 02:46:03.515]  I agree with you.
[02:46:03.795 --> 02:46:11.803]  I mean, I really think sunlight is the best disinfectant, but we've got to be ready for the government to carry out a big terror attack and bring in martial law.
[02:46:12.243 --> 02:46:15.526]  I mean, even Bob Woodward told the San Antonio Express News that last week.
[02:46:15.566 --> 02:46:18.489]  He said, one more big attack, and we're going to have a dictatorship.
[02:46:19.122 --> 02:46:21.984]  So people really have to get on the grassroots level.
[02:46:22.504 --> 02:46:37.133]  When I go out and photograph all over the world, I go usually because I've been asked by a group, a peace group, an organization, and I go to photograph those people who are doing something to alleviate the problem that I'm photographing.
[02:46:37.273 --> 02:46:39.854]  We've got Darja Mall coming on tomorrow, so we need those communities.
[02:46:40.074 --> 02:46:40.934]  Yeah, we need communities.
[02:46:41.334 --> 02:46:47.275]  We need people really on the grassroots level, because either we are the government or we're not.
[02:46:47.695 --> 02:46:51.756]  I mean, you can't just vote every year or two years or four years.
[02:46:52.616 --> 02:46:56.097]  You have to be in on who gets to be the candidate.
[02:46:56.457 --> 02:46:58.638]  And sometimes you have to be the candidate.
[02:46:59.458 --> 02:47:04.979]  I think a very good model for this kind of thing is something called the Industrial Areas Foundation.
[02:47:05.849 --> 02:47:14.231]  Here in Texas, it's run by Ernie Cortez, and the model is you go into, and this is basically a church-based operation.
[02:47:15.432 --> 02:47:24.894]  You go into a church because a church is an organization, and it's a geographical organization, and you say, what are the problems that you have in your own geographical area?
[02:47:25.214 --> 02:47:26.935]  Is it sewage?
[02:47:27.735 --> 02:47:29.075]  Is it lack of schools?
[02:47:29.175 --> 02:47:30.236]  Is it lack of libraries?
[02:47:30.296 --> 02:47:31.356]  Is it lack of getting people?
[02:47:31.937 --> 02:47:38.164]  A lot of times, is your area redlined against getting money to rehab your house and things like that?
[02:47:39.446 --> 02:47:41.007]  Whatever it is, let's organize.
[02:47:41.087 --> 02:47:42.129]  And then what happens?
[02:47:42.249 --> 02:47:43.010]  Around that issue.
[02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:47.294]  And then they get people to organize and do something and win.
[02:47:48.770 --> 02:47:50.532]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:47:50.572 --> 02:47:52.153]  They tell us we can't fight City Hall.
[02:47:52.213 --> 02:47:53.114]  We can fight City Hall.
[02:47:53.134 --> 02:47:55.176]  We can fight City Hall.
[02:47:55.736 --> 02:48:00.360]  In San Antonio, the banks wouldn't lend in the West San Antonio where it's poor.
[02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:14.432]  So they organized everybody in the parish to come in with bags of pennies and have them all changed into dollars and then get right around and go in with their dollars and have them change them into pennies until it drove the banks crazy and said, well, what do you want?
[02:48:14.912 --> 02:48:16.514]  We want you to loan us money.
[02:48:17.094 --> 02:48:20.197]  So really, we've got a population sitting around saying we can't affect change.
[02:48:20.217 --> 02:48:21.017]  It isn't true.
[02:48:21.038 --> 02:48:21.978]  You haven't tried yet.
[02:48:22.038 --> 02:48:22.279]  Yes.
[02:48:22.719 --> 02:48:26.222]  And so what he shows is you can pick an issue and you can win.
[02:48:26.262 --> 02:48:26.802]  That's what I've said.
[02:48:26.822 --> 02:48:30.325]  I've told listeners, I've heard of a shotgun approach to inform the people.
[02:48:30.646 --> 02:48:33.208]  Then everybody needs to pick an issue or two and focus on that.
[02:48:33.568 --> 02:48:34.469]  That's most effective.
[02:48:34.509 --> 02:48:38.212]  Final segment, take a few calls from Dale and Chris and others on the other side.
[02:48:38.252 --> 02:48:39.953]  Got to have you gentlemen back in.
[02:48:39.993 --> 02:48:43.276]  And we've got links on InfoWars.com to both these gentlemen's websites.
[02:48:43.576 --> 02:48:43.977]  Check them out.
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.862]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.122 --> 02:48:50.823]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:50.903 --> 02:48:51.684]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.044 --> 02:48:56.707]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.048 --> 02:49:03.793]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.113 --> 02:49:06.094]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.294 --> 02:49:09.115]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.235 --> 02:49:13.897]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.097 --> 02:49:18.498]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.739 --> 02:49:25.961]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.221 --> 02:49:28.642]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.802 --> 02:49:30.543]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:46.238 --> 02:49:48.199]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:48.279 --> 02:49:59.004]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:59.364 --> 02:50:03.886]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:03.966 --> 02:50:15.292]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.632 --> 02:50:16.353]  We're good to go.
[02:50:45.572 --> 02:50:48.393]  We're good to go.
[02:51:03.599 --> 02:51:04.259]  We're good to go.
[02:51:33.112 --> 02:51:36.218]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:36.379 --> 02:51:42.250]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:48.857 --> 02:51:49.778]  We're good to go.
[02:51:49.798 --> 02:51:50.438]  We're good to go.
[02:52:04.648 --> 02:52:05.009]  We're good to go.
[02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:24.331]  Right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:24.351 --> 02:52:25.411]  It's a great activist center.
[02:52:25.451 --> 02:52:26.791]  Go there and download all my films.
[02:52:27.092 --> 02:52:27.772]  Put them on disc.
[02:52:27.872 --> 02:52:28.492]  Give them to people.
[02:52:28.872 --> 02:52:30.233]  Very, very effective.
[02:52:30.453 --> 02:52:31.573]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:31.633 --> 02:52:33.054]  Infowars.com.
[02:52:33.074 --> 02:52:34.774]  If you'd like to hear this type of broadcast.
[02:52:35.074 --> 02:52:37.916]  Now, I only have time to take two calls quickly.
[02:52:38.416 --> 02:52:41.797]  But before we do that, Alan, please again plug your website.
[02:52:42.769 --> 02:52:45.210]  Documentaryphotographs.com.
[02:52:45.290 --> 02:52:50.211]  Documentaryphotographs.com, and you can check out what you guys are up to also at veteransforpeace.org.
[02:52:50.271 --> 02:52:52.731]  We'll have some time for some final comments here in a moment.
[02:52:52.952 --> 02:52:54.632]  Dale in New Hampshire, quickly, thanks for holding.
[02:52:57.133 --> 02:52:58.553]  Dale, you still there?
[02:53:00.113 --> 02:53:00.493]  He's gone.
[02:53:00.513 --> 02:53:01.013]  Let's move on.
[02:53:01.093 --> 02:53:01.894]  Chris in Kentucky.
[02:53:01.934 --> 02:53:02.394]  You're on the air.
[02:53:02.434 --> 02:53:02.974]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:53:04.133 --> 02:53:04.513]  Hello, Alex.
[02:53:04.533 --> 02:53:05.274]  Thank you very much.
[02:53:07.475 --> 02:53:15.298]  We have to get out here and get active now because I have people from the Iraqi community that I talk to know about how Saddam got in power by our government.
[02:53:15.618 --> 02:53:17.139]  They are waking up.
[02:53:17.379 --> 02:53:22.621]  I've talked to people in the high school I work at about the recruiter situation.
[02:53:22.641 --> 02:53:24.942]  He went to your website and is now waking up.
[02:53:26.023 --> 02:53:27.624]  There are people out there waking up.
[02:53:27.684 --> 02:53:32.846]  They're moving the recruiters in to have four or five-year relationships with the kids, full-time brainwashing them.
[02:53:33.391 --> 02:53:33.851]  Absolutely.
[02:53:33.891 --> 02:53:36.694]  And I told this student, I said, you better go to Infowars.com.
[02:53:36.754 --> 02:53:38.475]  And he came back and said, you know what, you're right.
[02:53:38.635 --> 02:53:39.976]  I'm not going to go into the military.
[02:53:39.996 --> 02:53:44.519]  The problem is now they're just going to get all the Latin Americans and use them.
[02:53:44.559 --> 02:53:48.102]  What, 20-something percent of the troops on the ground in Iraq are foreigners.
[02:53:48.122 --> 02:53:49.483]  You want to comment on that, gentlemen?
[02:53:50.224 --> 02:53:50.704]  Oh, yes.
[02:53:51.465 --> 02:53:54.006]  They're heavily recruiting in Hispanic areas.
[02:53:54.026 --> 02:53:59.911]  Just the other day, the Department of Defense was over at Houston-Tillotson recruiting.
[02:54:00.772 --> 02:54:03.254]  They're targeting minority groups.
[02:54:04.455 --> 02:54:06.677]  I mean, it's just like Michael Morrison.
[02:54:07.057 --> 02:54:09.119]  They're going to go to the malls where the poor kids are.
[02:54:09.139 --> 02:54:10.660]  They're not going to go to the rich kids' malls.
[02:54:11.521 --> 02:54:13.663]  It's literally a foreign mercenary army.
[02:54:14.163 --> 02:54:15.804]  Oh, recruiting from other countries.
[02:54:15.924 --> 02:54:17.866]  Oh, yeah, from the Pacific.
[02:54:19.267 --> 02:54:22.009]  Well, the former death squads.
[02:54:22.450 --> 02:54:23.490]  Darling, you want to comment on that?
[02:54:23.591 --> 02:54:23.951]  Yes.
[02:54:24.972 --> 02:54:26.213]  Economic conscription.
[02:54:27.213 --> 02:54:28.815]  I've looked at my life and...
[02:54:30.850 --> 02:54:35.332]  60 years ago, when I enlisted in the Navy, it was economic conscription.
[02:54:37.013 --> 02:54:41.854]  There were not many jobs for young people coming out of high school.
[02:54:42.515 --> 02:54:43.995]  Not that I came out of high school.
[02:54:44.035 --> 02:54:45.936]  I dropped out, but I made that up later.
[02:54:46.536 --> 02:54:52.098]  Do you think they're going to go back to the old press gangs, the old conscription?
[02:54:54.006 --> 02:54:55.487]  Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:54:55.667 --> 02:54:56.768]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:54:56.788 --> 02:55:05.413]  I have a grandson who's been to Kosovo, and he's been to Iraq, was extended in Iraq, and he's concerned about it being recalled.
[02:55:05.493 --> 02:55:08.775]  Yeah, involuntary re-upping when you've done three tours.
[02:55:09.055 --> 02:55:10.856]  They didn't even do that non-three tours.
[02:55:11.236 --> 02:55:12.057]  Oh, no.
[02:55:12.297 --> 02:55:16.059]  And right now they're dropping the intelligence quotient ceiling.
[02:55:16.079 --> 02:55:19.921]  You can be fatter, you can be slower, you can be...
[02:55:23.321 --> 02:55:23.662]  Dumber.
[02:55:23.682 --> 02:55:25.103]  Yeah, dumber.
[02:55:25.123 --> 02:55:28.206]  Oh, when I was in basic training, it was so sad.
[02:55:28.246 --> 02:55:28.947]  They let in like 200,000...
[02:55:30.885 --> 02:55:35.306]  You know, really low-IQ guys, and they were the butt of every joke.
[02:55:35.366 --> 02:55:36.647]  They were molested.
[02:55:36.727 --> 02:55:38.227]  They were made fun of.
[02:55:38.267 --> 02:55:38.888]  It was pitiful.
[02:55:39.848 --> 02:55:45.029]  All right, gentlemen, I want to thank you both for coming in studio today, and thank you both for joining us.
[02:55:45.109 --> 02:55:59.194]  Alan Pogue, a combat journalist, documentary photographer, and, of course, Mr. Darling, Don Darling, Navy veteran, worked in nuclear submarines, and, of course, commanded a Navy rescue ship, Navy diver, here exposing the whole globalist scam.
[02:55:59.234 --> 02:55:59.694]  Thank you, Don.
[02:56:00.214 --> 02:56:00.955]  You're very welcome.
[02:56:01.055 --> 02:56:04.558]  Can I have you guys back in in three or four months again to talk more about solutions?
[02:56:04.858 --> 02:56:05.939]  Yeah, I'd be happy to.
[02:56:05.979 --> 02:56:06.900]  I would too, yes.
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:08.562]  Yeah, I'll get a whole raft of them.
[02:56:08.842 --> 02:56:10.063]  Alan, where are you going next?
[02:56:10.964 --> 02:56:13.166]  Well, I might go to Colombia next.
[02:56:14.247 --> 02:56:20.793]  Also, of course, I'd love to go to Venezuela and Bolivia, but I think the most real thing for me right now is Colombia.
[02:56:20.913 --> 02:56:21.793]  All right, we're out of time.
