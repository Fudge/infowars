[00:00:05.623 --> 00:00:06.283]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:07.984]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:09.805]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:11.285]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:12.946]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:17.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:21.889]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.012]  Fighting the good fight, exposing corruption, wherever it might be.
[00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.411]  And restoring truth, justice in the American way.
[00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:37.835]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show live behind enemy lines, Austin, Texas.
[00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:40.797]  I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:43.620]  It is the 22nd day of June, 2006.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.982]  Thanks so much for joining us today, folks.
[00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.364]  We've got a great show for you.
[00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:53.468]  Joining us in about 30 minutes is Larry Pratt from Gun Owners of America.
[00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:54.769]  We'll be talking about...
[00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:58.752]  The shot heard round the world this 4th of July.
[00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.574]  That's right, this 4th of July.
[00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:06.399]  Americans mistakenly worried the United Nations might take all their guns.
[00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.420]  Well, that's exactly what will be happening.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.388]  While you and your families celebrate the 230th anniversary of the founding of our great nation, there's one party you won't be invited to.
[00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:19.144]  And that's the party.
[00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:34.794]  Kofi Annan is throwing at the United Nations headquarters in New York, using your tax dollars, your protection money, for nearly 50 dictatorships, 6 terrorist states, governments that endorse execution based on religious faith, and a multitude of other nations from around the globe.
[00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:39.838]  You see, this party isn't to honor your freedoms, but to conspire to take them away.
[00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:40.418]  That's right.
[00:01:41.155 --> 00:02:08.179]  Over your 4th of July holiday, while TAPS is playing at Arlington National Cemetery to honor Americans who have sacrificed their lives for freedom, these dictatorships, terrorist states, and so-called, quote-unquote, free nations of the world plan to meet on our home soil to finalize a United Nations treaty that would strip all citizens of all nations of their right to self-protection and strip your rights under the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms.
[00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:11.339]  Well, I mean, it depends on how you read this story.
[00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:18.664]  If you happen to go to Netscape.com or CNN, you'll find that this is all a giant conspiracy theory, and that the United Nations really doesn't take anyone's guns.
[00:02:18.684 --> 00:02:21.045]  In fact, they love to enable us to...
[00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:39.409]  Protect our Second Amendment rights.
[00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.575]  Well, I think if any of you have done any homework or listened to this show for any amount of time, you'll know that it's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:48.076]  This is part of the U.N.
[00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:49.097]  Charter, part of the U.N.
[00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:55.783]  Constitution, that George Herbert Walker Bush said we would henceforth pledge our allegiance to on September 11, 1991.
[00:02:57.324 --> 00:03:00.426]  1990, sorry, 11 years to the day before 9-11.
[00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:04.210]  We're going to talk to Larry Pratt from Gun Owners of America.
[00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.671]  He'll come up and give us a skinny on that.
[00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:07.394]  In roughly about 30 minutes.
[00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:11.803]  And then in the second hour, Colonel Ronald Ray will join us.
[00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:14.809]  USMCR, Marine Corps, retired.
[00:03:15.786 --> 00:03:32.910]  Restoring America's Virtue is one of the things he talks about, but we spoke to him in a pre-interview last night, and he is very aware of the New World Order, very aware of false flag terrorism, and a lot of the things we talk about on this program, including the United Nations gun grab.
[00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:43.992]  He was the first attorney for Daniel New, who stood up to the NATO forces, did not want to be controlled in Bosnia-Kosovo,
[00:03:44.993 --> 00:03:47.956]  By a NATO commander of another foreign country.
[00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:50.278]  Did not want to wear his UN armband.
[00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:57.244]  And there was Colonel Ronald Ray to represent him to the military so that he wouldn't be court-martialed.
[00:03:57.264 --> 00:04:05.050]  He's been on World News Tonight, Larry King Live, Hannity & Combs, Fox & Friends, The Today Show, Fox News, Crossfire, a number of other radio broadcasts.
[00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:12.897]  Colonel Ron Ray will join us in the second hour of today's program and agree largely with Smedley Butler.
[00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:15.860]  That is, war is a racket.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.461]  War for the corporations.
[00:04:17.961 --> 00:04:20.544]  Probably no war in history can be justified.
[00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:24.607]  We'll enjoy speaking to Ron Ray in the second hour of today's program.
[00:04:24.907 --> 00:04:26.008]  What's the big story?
[00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:29.851]  We'll get to this and likely continue covering this in the next segment.
[00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:34.297]  Hundreds of WMDs found in Iraq.
[00:04:34.317 --> 00:04:34.798]  That's right.
[00:04:35.018 --> 00:04:43.731]  This rang all through the Senate chambers, all through the neocon radio talk shows, globalist shill shows like Hannity and Combs.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.204]  Did we or did we not find WMDs in Iraq yesterday?
[00:04:48.525 --> 00:04:50.607]  And if we did, what would that mean?
[00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:51.908]  Stay tuned, folks.
[00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:53.530]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.372]  I'm Jack Blood, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:58.075]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[00:04:58.335 --> 00:05:00.678]  You're listening to the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:05.440]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:06.402]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.502 --> 00:05:07.283]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.623 --> 00:05:12.309]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:19.377]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.697 --> 00:05:21.678]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.720]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.483]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:34.086]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.326 --> 00:05:41.571]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:44.233]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.393 --> 00:05:46.134]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:02.984 --> 00:06:07.488]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:07.848 --> 00:06:11.932]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:12.232 --> 00:06:12.773]  We listened.
[00:06:13.093 --> 00:06:18.077]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:18.338 --> 00:06:18.818]  We listened.
[00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:22.261]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:23.202]  We listened.
[00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:24.162]  We're good to go.
[00:06:24.182 --> 00:06:24.422]  I think?
[00:06:53.015 --> 00:06:54.336]  We're good to go.
[00:07:14.616 --> 00:07:17.757]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:08:02.552 --> 00:08:08.577]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:12.241]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.044 --> 00:08:18.446]  We've got a lot of news to report today, folks.
[00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:22.630]  We're going to run down all of this news and give you some analysis as well.
[00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.852]  Of course, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.854]  Jack Blood filling in for Alex today.
[00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:35.718]  We're going to try to snap to a few of your calls here in the first hour and largely take a lot of calls in the third hour of today's program.
[00:08:35.738 --> 00:08:37.539]  We've got a lot of guests and a lot of news today.
[00:08:38.266 --> 00:09:01.336]  Before we get to Michigan installing surveillance cameras in park restrooms, or robots patrolling the World Cup for the first time, or New Orleans planning juvenile curfews, or AT&T rewriting rules, your data is not yours, or even new revelations about the Bilderberg Conference, let's talk about this phony... Okay, I'll keep an open mind.
[00:09:01.656 --> 00:09:06.939]  The WMDs finally found, three years later, in Iraq.
[00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:13.346]  Now, according to Fox News, the United States has found 500 chemical weapons in Iraq since 2003.
[00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:13.927]  500 chemical weapons!
[00:09:13.947 --> 00:09:14.147]  Now again,
[00:09:17.662 --> 00:09:20.643]  We have to remember how they're classifying chemical weapons.
[00:09:21.123 --> 00:09:23.464]  And we've heard them say this over and over again.
[00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:43.370]  In fact, I can remember years ago just after the real debate started heating up and the fact that it started to look like we weren't going to find those WMDs which, of course, we already knew about because we listened to Scott Ritter and Scott Ritter was a UN weapons inspector on the ground and already knew there would be no weapons of mass destruction there and we could go into that if you like.
[00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:44.971]  But
[00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:58.184]  According to a new report, they have found some weapons, but these again are weapons they've found over the years, and what is called into question here is the purity of the agents.
[00:09:58.204 --> 00:10:06.771]  I hate to have to rehash old news, but this is thanks to Rick Santorum, who recently brought this up in the debate in the Senate over the war.
[00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:12.845]  This, of course, is an attack on not just Democrats, but anybody who is anti-war.
[00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:21.716]  I'm sure we have a few anti-war people out there, or people who are anti-illegal war, anti-phony wars built on phony pretexts.
[00:10:21.796 --> 00:10:24.059]  This is pointing right at you.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.342]  So Fox News has dug up
[00:10:27.806 --> 00:10:31.808]  500 chemical weapons that they found throughout the years.
[00:10:32.168 --> 00:10:36.930]  Obviously, if this had any teeth at all, it would have been blasted all over the media.
[00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:45.554]  But I remember several times when neocon talk show hosts, even local talk show hosts down the dial from me when I was broadcasting up in Rhode Island, would latch on to this.
[00:10:45.714 --> 00:10:48.175]  Oh, we just found some chemical weapons.
[00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:49.475]  We just found some WMDs.
[00:10:49.576 --> 00:10:50.676]  What do you say about that?
[00:10:50.716 --> 00:10:55.418]  And then two days later, they'd never talk about it again, and they'd never retract it.
[00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:58.621]  There is a story right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:04.668]  Sean Hannity and Rick Santorum cling to discredited findings of WMDs in Iraq.
[00:11:04.948 --> 00:11:06.349]  You see, it's not about proof.
[00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:07.310]  It's not about evidence.
[00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:13.677]  It's merely about how many times you repeat things to, quote, propel the propaganda.
[00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:27.606]  What a coincidence that one week after Karl Rove urged Republicans not to make excuses for going to war against Iraq and put critical Democrats on the defense of Senator Rick Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania.
[00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:30.409]  I would say a Republicrat from Pennsylvania.
[00:11:31.349 --> 00:11:35.212]  Put together 18 points behind his re-election efforts.
[00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:43.319]  And Representative Peter Hoekstra suddenly came up with some report that 500 chemical weapons had been found in Iraq.
[00:11:44.244 --> 00:12:02.639]  Almost the entire hour of Hannity and Combs last night was devoted to this quote-unquote discovery, despite the fact that Fox News' own Jim Angle already had reported that the Bush administration said the weapons were not in usable condition and were not the WMDs for which we went to war.
[00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:03.580]  You see, that's the point.
[00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:27.940]  Even if today, tomorrow, they found 500 barrels of Cerex gas or 500 barrels of some chemical odd weapon, the fact is, these particular... I'm calling these WMDs is actually even a stretch, but these particular variation of weapons need to be maintained constantly or they go bad.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.561]  And they amount to nothing really but poison.
[00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:34.593]  And I'm pretty sure that most countries of the world have poison.
[00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:40.801]  The entire show was filled with Fox News alerts about the report.
[00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:49.873]  This is exactly what we suspected we had all along, Hannity Crowed, before adding falsely, this is only a part of why we went into Iraq.
[00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:55.402]  Yeah, that is false, because of course, we have to remember, going back, this was the prime reason.
[00:12:55.422 --> 00:13:03.688]  He had WMDs, he was going to give these to the terrorists, and he was going to use them against the United States, and oh yeah, there was a mushroom cloud coming.
[00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:08.111]  Yes, I know that the neocon pundits will deny that that was ever said.
[00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:15.776]  Unfortunately for them, this is recorded ad nauseum by Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld, and George W. Bush.
[00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:19.138]  We have to stop Saddam Hussein, or the mushroom cloud is coming.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.546]  But what Hannity never asked...
[00:13:22.515 --> 00:13:32.378]  Either Santorum or Hoekstra, both of whom appeared on the show, about the administration's response or the likely degraded condition of the chemical weapons.
[00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:33.978]  They just passed right over that.
[00:13:34.118 --> 00:13:37.359]  Because look, folks, they're attacking you to their base.
[00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:41.580]  They're trying to reel in their base, who, by the way, is very upset.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.160]  We're going to go to this gun-grabbing story here in a minute.
[00:13:44.561 --> 00:13:45.661]  This is just one of the reasons.
[00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:46.481]  Immigration.
[00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:48.462]  The massive deficit.
[00:13:48.482 --> 00:13:49.822]  The biggest deficit in history.
[00:13:50.402 --> 00:14:01.954]  The growing of government, the consolidation of power, the kowtowing to the corporations, the lack of privacy, the lack of freedom, the evisceration of the Constitution.
[00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:07.160]  These are all things that actual conservatives get very upset about.
[00:14:09.302 --> 00:14:12.866]  And, of course, wasting all of our time and all of these lives and...
[00:14:13.556 --> 00:14:21.639]  Degrading and debilitating our armed forces by go-finding nation-building wars around the world.
[00:14:22.359 --> 00:14:29.662]  In fact, it wasn't until Alan Combs' portion of the discussion that Jim Angle's reporting was ever mentioned.
[00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:32.643]  Jim Angle reported this for Fox News.
[00:14:33.263 --> 00:14:35.164]  He quotes a defense official who says...
[00:14:35.894 --> 00:14:48.024]  These were pre-1991 weapons that could not have been fired as designed because they had already been degraded and the official went on to say that these are not WMDs.
[00:14:48.684 --> 00:14:54.689]  This country and the rest of the world believed Iraq had and not the WMDs for which this country went to war.
[00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:04.457]  So the chess beating that the Republicans are doing last night and today, this of course is a justification for
[00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:09.102]  And, again, not confirmed by the Defense Department.
[00:15:09.383 --> 00:15:14.547]  Santorum pooh-poohed that by saying, I'd like to know who that Defense Department spokesperson is.
[00:15:14.587 --> 00:15:22.735]  The fact of the matter is, I'll wait and see what the actual Defense Department formally says, or more importantly, the administration formally says.
[00:15:22.775 --> 00:15:27.599]  Of course, you and I both know we can't trust either the Bush administration or the Department of Defense.
[00:15:28.356 --> 00:15:43.043]  The Defense Department's comments were deemed credible enough to post on FoxNews.com, but Santorum insisted that the weapons couldn't maybe be fired efficiently and that they certainly could be used in a terrorist incident.
[00:15:44.104 --> 00:15:46.025]  Maybe they could be fired efficiently.
[00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:48.886]  Certainly they could be used in a terrorist incident.
[00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:52.988]  Yeah, so could Coca-Cola and Borax, okay?
[00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:58.574]  Combs noted that the White House has been silent, which Santorum could not account for.
[00:15:58.594 --> 00:16:10.502]  Of course, if this is true, if this was valid, we know that George Bush and Karl Rove would be using this, but they don't have to use it because they have Hannity and they have Santorum to do it for them.
[00:16:10.562 --> 00:16:14.045]  And they don't have to take any of the fallout when this turns out to be wrong.
[00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:24.232]  All they need to do is convince a few Americans out there, a few sheeple out there, a few Stepford Republicans that this is true and their objective is accomplished.
[00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:46.167]  Combs, who this story says was at the top of his game, all right, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, in this segment said further, Santorum's 18 points, his 18 points behind his challenger, wasn't this a quote-unquote desperate attempt by Santorum to reestablish himself in a race in which he's not doing very well?
[00:16:46.387 --> 00:16:50.969]  Well, good for you, Combs, though again, it's not about Democrats and Republicans as we know on this show.
[00:16:53.050 --> 00:17:02.485]  Oaksford insisted that reports undermine the democratic criticism of the war when, quote, we all knew before the war that Saddam had chemical weapons of mass destruction.
[00:17:04.112 --> 00:17:04.452]  Yes.
[00:17:05.013 --> 00:17:12.416]  The UN weapons inspectors declared in 2004 that there were no WMDs or any significant WMDs in Iraq.
[00:17:12.456 --> 00:17:20.400]  Despite that, Hoekstra insisted that this new report created an overwhelming case about how dangerous this regime was.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:30.785]  This, again, going back to the very, very weak position of our government, of the president, regarding WMDs.
[00:17:30.905 --> 00:17:32.325]  But, again, I mean, this isn't a surprise.
[00:17:32.345 --> 00:17:32.385]  In 1999...
[00:17:34.494 --> 00:17:45.682]  We saw the original Scott Ritter report, and again, before they let him go, when he wasn't happily confirming mass WMDs in Iraq, it said exactly that.
[00:17:46.442 --> 00:17:50.405]  There was no possibility of any major WMDs in Iraq.
[00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:53.267]  But again, we're beating a dead horse here.
[00:17:53.327 --> 00:17:58.250]  I just wanted to make sure we got this out, because God forbid somebody out there believes this tripe.
[00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:00.875]  Sean Hannity obviously does.
[00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:01.495]  Or does he?
[00:18:01.535 --> 00:18:02.076]  What do you think?
[00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:04.357]  Do you think Sean Hannity actually believes this?
[00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:08.440]  I mean, do you think that he's sweating a little bit under the collar?
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:15.324]  Do you think he maybe had an argument with one of his producers or his controllers or handlers that put him up to this?
[00:18:15.684 --> 00:18:17.545]  Saying, I can't go with this weak story.
[00:18:18.146 --> 00:18:19.266]  Oh, yes you can, Sean.
[00:18:20.387 --> 00:18:21.448]  Sean Hannity.
[00:18:21.528 --> 00:18:22.448]  Rick Santorum.
[00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:24.389]  Let's just call them what they are.
[00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.270]  Liars!
[00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:28.232]  We like to say that, uh...
[00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:33.747]  Every day, exposing the lies that your trusted government officials do not want you to know about.
[00:18:33.787 --> 00:18:35.428]  Well, here's a couple of problems.
[00:18:35.968 --> 00:18:38.809]  One, the mainstream media goes along with this tripe.
[00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:42.070]  And two, we should never trust our government.
[00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.510]  Ever.
[00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:45.171]  No government should ever be trusted.
[00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:45.732]  Ever.
[00:18:46.152 --> 00:18:50.714]  And as the great Bill Hicks once said, all governments are murderers and liars.
[00:18:51.094 --> 00:18:52.814]  Does that mean I'm an anarchist?
[00:18:53.075 --> 00:18:54.055]  Absolutely not.
[00:18:54.595 --> 00:18:56.898]  I believe in a constitutional rule of law.
[00:18:57.258 --> 00:19:00.922]  Because we have a few knuckleheads out there that don't know how to behave themselves.
[00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.265]  That don't know how to do unto others as they would like done unto them.
[00:19:04.465 --> 00:19:05.907]  So we have to have laws.
[00:19:05.987 --> 00:19:10.612]  Unfortunately, people are just too stupid to be good to their neighbors.
[00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:14.035]  So no, we can't have no government at all.
[00:19:14.055 --> 00:19:15.477]  We can't be total anarchists.
[00:19:15.885 --> 00:19:22.233]  I'm sure I'll get a few letters from this explaining to me in a 20-page manifesto about exactly what we need.
[00:19:22.814 --> 00:19:25.737]  And no, we'll never be able to trust government.
[00:19:25.777 --> 00:19:28.921]  That's why our government was set up with checks and balances.
[00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:34.248]  Unfortunately, most of those checks and balances have been checked and balanced right off the books.
[00:19:35.728 --> 00:19:37.229]  That's why we're doing this program.
[00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:39.030]  That's why it's up to you to be a check and balance.
[00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.771]  But now you have the truth about the WMDs.
[00:19:41.811 --> 00:19:43.312]  The WMDs are old.
[00:19:43.592 --> 00:19:44.312]  They're used up.
[00:19:44.612 --> 00:19:45.733]  They never would have worked.
[00:19:46.093 --> 00:19:47.994]  And this is absolute shill.
[00:19:48.034 --> 00:19:48.795]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:51.096]  More news, information, your calls right after this.

[00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.171]  We're good to go.
[00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.190]  Okay.
[00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:33.716]  Saddam's third or fourth lawyer, I've lost track now, killed and paraded around the streets of Baghdad by so-called Shia militia, although they were wearing Iraqi police uniforms.
[00:24:34.276 --> 00:24:43.801]  This also goes to our two dead and tortured Marines who were sacrificed also by people wearing Iraqi police uniforms.
[00:24:44.681 --> 00:24:48.523]  We know how easy these uniforms are to get, and I guess this could be anybody, and then on this
[00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:51.933]  This is also another similar story out of Iraq.
[00:24:51.953 --> 00:24:53.334]  And this is real news out of Iraq.
[00:24:53.394 --> 00:24:57.498]  A sailor and seven marines charged in an Iraqi slaying plot.
[00:24:58.098 --> 00:25:01.161]  Seven marines and a sailor were charged with murder yesterday.
[00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:10.309]  The alleged planning killing of a disabled Iraqi civilian whose shooting death was staged to look like a foiled roadside bombing.
[00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:20.224]  In a separate case, a fourth soldier from the Army's 101st Airborne Division was charged with premeditated murder in the shooting deaths of three prisoners north of Baghdad.
[00:25:20.564 --> 00:25:28.547]  The new cases bring to 12 the number of servicemen facing the death penalty for actions across the battlefield.
[00:25:28.847 --> 00:25:31.908]  I'm sure no one higher up is going to be taking responsibility for this.
[00:25:33.391 --> 00:25:45.543]  Military law experts could not recall a previous time when so many troops faced capital punishment suggesting the heightened awareness of commanders to the impact of atrocity allegations on the Iraq war effort.
[00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:46.744]  That's right, folks.
[00:25:46.844 --> 00:25:50.047]  Our troops are going mad in Iraq.
[00:25:51.232 --> 00:26:00.135]  Charges are also expected to be filed soon against several more Marines in the shooting deaths of 24 unarmed civilians in the western town of Haditha November 19th.
[00:26:00.535 --> 00:26:15.040]  At Camp Pendleton, California, Colonel Stuart Navarre said the Marine Corps, quote, prides itself on holding members accountable for their actions as he announced the charges against these seven enlisted Marines and Navy corpsmen or medic.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.681]  They threw this guy down a hole.
[00:26:19.397 --> 00:26:32.426]  Tortured him, beat him up a little bit, and shot him, and then planted an M16 and a shovel next to him to try to stage his death as somebody who was shot trying to plant IEDs in Iraq.
[00:26:33.506 --> 00:26:35.948]  I mean, I hope that's not what our boys are there to do.
[00:26:37.008 --> 00:26:40.230]  And I'd sure like to see somebody's head roll at the Pentagon for this.
[00:26:40.671 --> 00:26:42.532]  Don't worry, because I know we have...
[00:26:43.502 --> 00:26:45.265]  Various spooks listened to the program.
[00:26:45.305 --> 00:26:47.428]  That was what you call a metaphor.
[00:26:47.468 --> 00:26:50.492]  Yes, we use metaphors on talk radio programs.
[00:26:51.934 --> 00:26:55.459]  So, obviously, this is something Donald Rumsfeld needs to account for.
[00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:56.541]  Will he account for it?
[00:26:58.012 --> 00:26:59.232]  I think we know the answer to that.
[00:26:59.252 --> 00:26:59.893]  800-259-9231.
[00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:06.675]  Anything you want to talk about here, I can take a few calls, and then Larry Pratt is going to join us just a few minutes here.
[00:27:06.695 --> 00:27:07.935]  I've got to announce real quick, though.
[00:27:08.195 --> 00:27:09.135]  You already knew this.
[00:27:09.616 --> 00:27:14.177]  We were hinting at this wildly, but it has been confirmed, and I have been told to announce.
[00:27:14.557 --> 00:27:15.878]  Thanks for calling in.
[00:27:15.918 --> 00:27:17.138]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:27:17.198 --> 00:27:17.458]  Hey, Jack.
[00:27:44.602 --> 00:27:46.423]  I nearly fell out of bed this morning.
[00:27:46.703 --> 00:27:58.286]  They started up a smoker's vaccine program at UW-Madison, and I was reading through the documentation online, and they were saying that it'll cause an antibody response to nicotine.
[00:27:58.907 --> 00:27:59.707]  I was thinking about it.
[00:27:59.767 --> 00:28:04.868]  Okay, well, that's not as bad as it could be, but then I started thinking, well, what's like nicotine?
[00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:06.709]  Caffeine and everything else.
[00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:14.251]  So in the morning, after you've been inoculated against us, you drink your cup of coffee and it doesn't do a thing.
[00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:15.452]  Gee, I wonder why.
[00:28:16.212 --> 00:28:28.861]  And I thought, well, gee, if they make it communicable, like you can spread it to everybody else, then not only are you in this test trial, but everybody else
[00:28:29.802 --> 00:28:35.865]  Well, you know, obviously we've got to have a little more information here on this.
[00:28:35.925 --> 00:28:38.766]  I mean, look, there are actual nicotine blockers.
[00:28:38.806 --> 00:28:39.966]  They do actually work.
[00:28:40.146 --> 00:28:46.469]  And, yes, nicotine is an extremely dangerous and addictive drug that I happen to be addicted to myself.
[00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:49.230]  So I don't know, Joe, if there's all this to it.
[00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:55.633]  I certainly would be very wary of any type of inoculations, especially by university studies or by the government.
[00:28:55.653 --> 00:28:56.473]  I think we all know that.
[00:28:56.753 --> 00:29:03.318]  I think they would also accidentally switch a batch with a different lot number, and all of a sudden you get the Emerson blocker.
[00:29:04.059 --> 00:29:09.423]  They could do anything, Joe, but without any proof of this, I mean, we'd just be speculating, wouldn't we?
[00:29:09.443 --> 00:29:12.525]  Yeah, I guess so, but I still almost fell out of bed.
[00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:14.947]  It's like, oh my God, they're doing the same thing.
[00:29:14.967 --> 00:29:17.829]  Well, hey man, good that you're keeping your eyes open anyway.
[00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:18.750]  We'll try to look into that.
[00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.152]  Feel free to send me the news story if you got one, and we'll take a look at that.
[00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:22.633]  Okay, Joe?
[00:29:22.653 --> 00:29:25.315]  I finally started the website, and yeah, I sent you that link.
[00:29:25.766 --> 00:29:27.007]  Okay, good news.
[00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:30.048]  Eric Pratt joining us here in just a few minutes.
[00:29:30.068 --> 00:29:32.750]  We're going to talk about this UN gun grab on the 4th of July.
[00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.912]  Robert and Callie, Jesse in Nevada, everybody patiently holding.
[00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:36.692]  Stay with us.
[00:29:36.712 --> 00:29:37.352]  We'll get you on the air.
[00:29:37.392 --> 00:29:38.413]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:38.433 --> 00:29:38.893]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.021]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:55.002]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:58.795]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.839 --> 00:30:05.904]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:30:06.105 --> 00:30:09.509]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:30:09.689 --> 00:30:13.094]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:30:13.399 --> 00:30:16.661]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:22.164]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:30:22.184 --> 00:30:31.829]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:30:31.949 --> 00:30:33.290]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:38.733]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:30:39.233 --> 00:30:43.656]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:30:43.676 --> 00:30:45.117]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:30:45.278 --> 00:30:49.941]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?

[00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:10.507]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:11.107 --> 00:33:14.129]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:30.378]  Alex Jones is in Los Angeles, paving the way for thousands of people to join one of the greatest 9-11 conferences ever put together, ever assembled.
[00:33:31.603 --> 00:33:32.725]  And I am sitting in for Alex.
[00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:33.826]  My name is Jack Blood.
[00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:36.930]  I am also a host on this network, the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:42.698]  My show, of course, follows Alex Jones' show Monday through Friday at 2 o'clock Central Time.
[00:33:43.079 --> 00:33:47.925]  And as we just announced, Charlie Sheen has now made it public that he will be speaking at that 9-11 conference.
[00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:56.310]  I want to talk about gun control and this potential UN gun grab that seems to be taking place on July 4th of all dates.
[00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:06.356]  We know that these people, these globalists, love to use these dates as calling cards and certain numerological significance for themselves and their occult fellowship.
[00:34:06.876 --> 00:34:09.798]  So I think this is probably exactly right.
[00:34:09.818 --> 00:34:14.240]  But we have Eric Pratt with us from GunOwners.com, GunOwnersOfAmerica.com.
[00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:17.934]  Eric, thanks for making time here on such short notice to join us here.
[00:34:17.974 --> 00:34:19.836]  I'm sure you've seen this story by the NRA.
[00:34:20.397 --> 00:34:21.578]  Yes, we have, absolutely.
[00:34:21.598 --> 00:34:24.222]  In fact, we put out an alert to our members about this.
[00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:30.790]  Yeah, what a slap in the face to all Americans here on one of our most sacred holidays.
[00:34:32.068 --> 00:34:37.670]  You know, having gun control and disarmament being discussed in our own land.
[00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.351]  And really, Jack, this is the latest in a series of gun control conferences where the U.N.
[00:34:42.431 --> 00:34:45.772]  is trying to get member nations like us to sign a gun control treaty.
[00:34:45.812 --> 00:34:52.714]  And the ostensible reason that they talk about is gun control trafficking, illicit gun control trafficking, things like that.
[00:34:52.734 --> 00:34:53.954]  They'll throw out these terms.
[00:34:54.594 --> 00:35:03.140]  When you listen to what the official delegates at these conferences are saying, you see that what they're really after is your guns and my guns.
[00:35:03.781 --> 00:35:04.821]  That's what they're really after.
[00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:19.211]  For example, at the first of these conferences back in 2001, the delegate from Ireland boldly admitted that the purpose of these conferences was to get the nations of the world to suppress the private ownership of small arms and light weapons.
[00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:22.734]  He didn't want any private weapons for self-defense anywhere.
[00:35:23.556 --> 00:35:25.217]  And that's really what it's all about.
[00:35:25.237 --> 00:35:32.139]  You know, I think a lot of times we get desensitized when we hear that, you know, they throw the word small arms around.
[00:35:32.199 --> 00:35:37.220]  And to the American ear, we might think of rocket or grenade launchers.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:45.362]  But UN documents define small arms as things like pistols, revolvers, shotguns, semi-automatic fires.
[00:35:45.402 --> 00:35:47.223]  I mean, that's really what they're after.
[00:35:47.843 --> 00:35:48.304]  We're good to go.
[00:36:05.776 --> 00:36:08.838]  These are the guns they especially hate and want to do away with.
[00:36:21.235 --> 00:36:23.557]  Verify this for me, because I'm pretty sure that's the situation.
[00:36:23.577 --> 00:36:24.037]  That's correct.
[00:36:24.077 --> 00:36:25.518]  The semi-auto ban expired, yeah.
[00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:36.246]  But then in places like Los Angeles, Chicago, D.C., New York, and most particularly San Francisco, they're doing massive gun grabs right in people's faces, actually.
[00:36:36.566 --> 00:36:46.193]  Well, and isn't it interesting that in those places which are the most restrictive, and of course this isn't anything new, I mean, these are the places that are the most dangerous.
[00:36:46.294 --> 00:36:49.436]  And not only in our own country, but even...
[00:36:49.876 --> 00:36:50.136]  I think so.
[00:37:13.428 --> 00:37:13.928]  In England.
[00:37:14.969 --> 00:37:16.490]  So what did they do then, Eric?
[00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.032]  They still had all the murders, and now they're batting knives in England.
[00:37:20.272 --> 00:37:21.013]  Well, exactly.
[00:37:21.133 --> 00:37:22.553]  And so you're going to bat baseball bats.
[00:37:22.674 --> 00:37:26.056]  And now the Bobbies are having to carry firearms.
[00:37:26.096 --> 00:37:29.718]  For the longest time, they only carried nightsticks because it has gotten so dangerous.
[00:37:29.758 --> 00:37:42.005]  In fact, ironically, the United Nations themselves did a study in 2000, compared crime statistics all around the world of the 16 leading industrialized nations in the West
[00:37:42.976 --> 00:37:48.958]  England is at the top now with the highest crime rate, even higher than the United States.
[00:37:48.998 --> 00:37:49.938]  So isn't it interesting?
[00:37:50.318 --> 00:38:03.922]  A country that used to enjoy very low crime rates now has the highest crime rate, even while you can't blame it, at least on legal guns, because there are no legal guns, and yet they have a tremendous problem with
[00:38:04.372 --> 00:38:06.133]  Gun trafficking, illegal guns.
[00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:13.495]  In fact, the mayor of London not too long ago said he actually feels safer in New York City than he does in his own city of London.
[00:38:13.715 --> 00:38:14.255]  There you go.
[00:38:14.275 --> 00:38:15.475]  That's how bad it's gotten.
[00:38:15.675 --> 00:38:25.999]  I mean, because if there's gun control, and it is control, folks, that's the key word there, just like the war on drugs or the war on terrorism, you just seem to get more violence, more terrorism, more drugs.
[00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:30.440]  You wouldn't be surprised to know, I'm sure, that the United Nations has denied all of this.
[00:38:31.024 --> 00:38:31.465]  We're good to go.
[00:38:40.164 --> 00:38:41.545]  The phones are being flooded.
[00:38:41.825 --> 00:38:48.150]  John Bolton is being seriously attacked and flooded with letters and calls to do something about this.
[00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:56.415]  And they say, well, we're just going to meet at the United Nations and watch the fireworks and have a little discussion on gun control.
[00:38:56.495 --> 00:38:58.997]  It's nothing serious, nothing to be worried about.
[00:38:59.057 --> 00:39:01.519]  In fact, this is just a giant conspiracy theory.
[00:39:01.719 --> 00:39:06.202]  That is the official statement by the United Nations, of course, carried by...
[00:39:07.163 --> 00:39:09.844]  The Communist Network, CNN, and Reuters as well.
[00:39:10.744 --> 00:39:14.965]  Yeah, I think it's a good thing for people to contact the State Department.
[00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.406]  In fact, we've tried to make that easy.
[00:39:16.726 --> 00:39:23.247]  At the top of our website at gunowners.org, we have a link which discusses this issue that we're talking about here.
[00:39:23.287 --> 00:39:26.988]  We have a pre-written letter, actually two pre-written letters to make it easy for people.
[00:39:27.148 --> 00:39:28.949]  One that will go to their senators.
[00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.810]  We're good to go.
[00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:30.330]  We're good to go.
[00:39:48.892 --> 00:39:49.192]  I think so.
[00:40:06.438 --> 00:40:15.164]  What they sought to have as mandatory controls, they could only then have as recommendations, since the United States wouldn't go along.
[00:40:15.384 --> 00:40:23.989]  Eric, as you say this is incremental, I certainly wouldn't be too happy trusting my gun ownership rights to John Bolton, to be quite honest with you.
[00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:25.330]  Well, I agree.
[00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.992]  I don't think we should trust it to anyone, man.
[00:40:28.052 --> 00:40:31.674]  And that's why I did make mention of legislation in the Senate.
[00:40:32.174 --> 00:40:36.037]  That's been introduced by David Vitter of Louisiana.
[00:40:36.117 --> 00:40:36.577]  It's S-1488.
[00:40:36.938 --> 00:40:39.380]  And what it does is it would cut off U.S.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.620]  funds to the U.N.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.103]  And now as I say this, you've got to see my wink wink and nod here.
[00:40:44.543 --> 00:40:45.244]  If the U.N.
[00:40:45.284 --> 00:40:50.448]  does anything to infringe upon our gun rights, well, you know they're already infringing upon our gun rights.
[00:40:50.488 --> 00:40:54.911]  So the importance of this legislation is that when it gets passed,
[00:40:55.439 --> 00:41:04.788]  It then allows a president with a backbone to say, well, you know, the law says this, so we're now cutting off our 22% of the UN budget.
[00:41:05.148 --> 00:41:06.670]  No more money from the United States.
[00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.854]  Okay, when you have a president with a backbone, will you let me know whenever that happens?
[00:41:11.894 --> 00:41:13.975]  I don't foresee that happening anytime soon.
[00:41:15.376 --> 00:41:17.256]  That thing comes back to us then, Jack.
[00:41:17.296 --> 00:41:21.158]  You and me and the American people, we've got to put in somebody with a backbone.
[00:41:21.698 --> 00:41:26.740]  To the extent that we don't, then we have to look in the mirror and say, hey, it's partly our fault too.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.063]  Well, this show, Eric, going out to a lot of quote-unquote red states, okay?
[00:41:31.143 --> 00:41:32.704]  So we need to get this out to people.
[00:41:32.804 --> 00:41:33.104]  Absolutely.
[00:41:33.144 --> 00:41:39.169]  We need to do a really serious study on George W. Bush's record about gun control.
[00:41:39.229 --> 00:41:43.872]  And, yeah, there have been a few victories, but I wouldn't accredit Bush for those victories.
[00:41:43.912 --> 00:41:47.875]  I would accredit guys like you and guys like the NRA for this particular victory.
[00:41:53.158 --> 00:42:12.810]  I hope most of your listeners know that had the Congress reauthorized that ban, the Clinton 1994 ban, which was in force for 10 years, banned more than 200 types of firearms, that if Congress had reauthorized that ban, President Bush said, I will sign it.
[00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:21.602]  So, yeah, we know he's not, I mean, even though he may be from Texas and speak with a drawl, he's not a super defender of the Second Amendment.
[00:42:21.682 --> 00:42:24.864]  He's from Kennebunkport, but what's that between friends?
[00:42:25.264 --> 00:42:28.106]  I mean, he has done some good things on the issue.
[00:42:28.126 --> 00:42:29.827]  He did sign a concealed carry bill.
[00:42:30.167 --> 00:42:34.390]  So it just shows, you know, he kind of goes back and forth over the fence on this issue.
[00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.251]  And the fact that he would have signed...
[00:42:36.831 --> 00:42:42.372]  This onerous, unconstitutional ban just shows that he's not solidly 100% with us.
[00:42:42.392 --> 00:42:49.693]  Well, what we've got to look out for, Eric, is once we get past these midterms here, they'll have nothing left to lose, basically, at least the Bush administration.
[00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:55.354]  And I think that that's some time where we've really got to watch out for our gun ownership rights.
[00:42:55.394 --> 00:43:05.116]  Now, are you familiar with the phrase in the UN Charter, I believe, that just basically says that they're going to have to take all of our guns for a more, quote-unquote, peaceful world?
[00:43:06.215 --> 00:43:08.497]  Well, I don't know the phrase that you're referring to.
[00:43:08.517 --> 00:43:10.939]  I mean, certainly that is what the U.N.
[00:43:10.999 --> 00:43:11.760]  is all about.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:18.185]  You know, they've produced a video entitled, Armed to the Teeth, which is openly supportive of gun banning.
[00:43:18.665 --> 00:43:20.187]  It even includes a scene.
[00:43:20.247 --> 00:43:32.397]  I didn't know this was going on in our country, but according to the video, every September in the United States, all across the country, American schoolchildren, and I assume what are probably public schools,
[00:43:33.113 --> 00:43:35.574]  Taking a pledge never to touch a gun.
[00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:40.577]  Now, I don't imagine that happens in every school, but it's happening in enough of them.
[00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:48.381]  And, of course, they're trumpeting this along with their other asinine statements that they were making about the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:43:48.441 --> 00:43:52.463]  But, yeah, they are all about disarmament.
[00:43:52.984 --> 00:43:58.967]  In fact, usually you see them on the side of oppressive governments and against...
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.981]  Anybody who would be resisting the tyrannical regimes.
[00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:23.008]  I mean, Rwanda in 1994 is the classic example of that, where they helped arm the Hutu government, but then they sat idly by, even helped them have access to the weapons that were confiscated, and then sat idly by as genocide was committed by the Hutus, just wiped out.
[00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:29.094]  Almost a million tootsies just wiped them out, and these guys had been left defenseless.
[00:44:29.174 --> 00:44:35.559]  Largely with machetes, so if there had been guns, obviously they could have defended themselves against guys with machetes.
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.060]  Absolutely.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:45.887]  You constantly see them taking the side of the dictator and opposing the freedom fighter or those who stand for freedom.
[00:44:47.008 --> 00:44:52.874]  In fact, this was something that Lawrence Oster, who's a reporter who covered the first U.N.
[00:44:52.894 --> 00:44:55.317]  gun control conference in 2001, picked up.
[00:44:55.717 --> 00:44:58.440]  He says that the disarmament agenda at the U.N.
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:06.268]  is so blatant that they unembarrassedly admit that they want to strip small arms from anyone who's not associated with a government.
[00:45:06.648 --> 00:45:14.115]  Because their idea is that they want the possession of such weapons to be gone so that people can't oppose the UN itself.
[00:45:14.155 --> 00:45:15.516]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:45:15.536 --> 00:45:19.039]  And sure, and we know that that's part of the reason that we're still as free as we are.
[00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:21.501]  We can debate how free we really are here as well.
[00:45:21.521 --> 00:45:23.583]  That's why we don't speak with a British accent, right?
[00:45:23.663 --> 00:45:24.624]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:25.565 --> 00:45:30.988]  What do you speculate is going to be said and done in a meeting like this on July 4th by the UN?
[00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:33.270]  What objectives are they going to put together?
[00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:34.851]  How are they going to package this?
[00:45:34.871 --> 00:45:38.473]  Do you have any idea of what might be said in the halls of the UN on July 4th?
[00:45:38.653 --> 00:45:46.599]  Well, one of the things they're going to be doing is reviewing what they call as progress, what progress has been made since their first conference in 2001.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.301]  Ideally, they want to...
[00:45:50.121 --> 00:45:50.822]  I think so.
[00:46:02.786 --> 00:46:05.327]  Things such as registration of all firearms.
[00:46:05.407 --> 00:46:12.430]  Now, we do have a type of registration, a decentralized registration in this country at the gun dealer shop.
[00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:17.192]  In fact, you could argue we have a centralized registration with the NICS background check.
[00:46:17.592 --> 00:46:21.554]  They tell us that those names are being deleted after 24 hours.
[00:46:22.734 --> 00:46:26.096]  You know, whether any one of us as an individual... No one believes that, Eric.
[00:46:26.156 --> 00:46:27.037]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:27.077 --> 00:46:30.098]  Can actually document that that's truly happening.
[00:46:30.158 --> 00:46:33.280]  I mean, you have to leave that, at least at best, as an open question.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.642]  So, you know, registration is one thing that they're after.
[00:46:35.802 --> 00:46:46.188]  And the horror idea of having, you know, UN bureaucrats at the world global level having, you know, lists of American gun owners' names is certainly horrifying.
[00:46:46.508 --> 00:46:49.530]  But they also want a national system of licensing...
[00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:58.912]  And, of course, with licensing goes control and, you know, increase of fees, being able to, you know, basically make it difficult for people to even get a license to have a firearm.
[00:46:59.652 --> 00:47:06.813]  They want a so-called assault weapons ban, you know, ban on military-style firearms like the Colt AR-15 guns like that.
[00:47:07.353 --> 00:47:10.574]  They also want mandatory lock-up-your-safety laws.
[00:47:10.954 --> 00:47:18.415]  So, in other words, even while you are still allowed, in other words, not that you have the right to have a gun, but even while we still let you have a gun...
[00:47:18.857 --> 00:47:25.140]  You're going to have to have it locked up, and it's not going to be immediately useful in a case of self-defense.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:41.767]  For folks who might think that that's a good idea, that's a good law, realize that there are documented cases where people have died because when the bad guy shows up in your home, they don't have a trigger lock on their knife or their gun or whatever weapon they're using.
[00:47:42.267 --> 00:47:44.248]  So if you have to be fumbling in the dark...
[00:47:44.548 --> 00:47:51.196]  No, that's absolutely true because most of the crooks that are going to do a home invasion are going to come in the middle of the night.
[00:48:01.367 --> 00:48:09.091]  When you're asleep and you're going to have to make some real quick at-the-ready for your weapons, and if they're all locked up, you certainly cannot do that.
[00:48:09.231 --> 00:48:09.671]  Absolutely.
[00:48:09.691 --> 00:48:14.273]  In fact, there was a horrid situation in California where the home invasion didn't even involve a gun.
[00:48:14.333 --> 00:48:16.234]  It involved a pitchfork.
[00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:24.538]  The guy was buck naked, was out of his mind on drugs, and he managed to kill two of the kids in the home because the homeowners...
[00:48:25.026 --> 00:48:28.467]  Could not find the key to get their guns unlocked.
[00:48:28.527 --> 00:48:34.528]  Because, by the way, Jack, California requires that gun owners have their guns locked up.
[00:48:34.608 --> 00:48:38.129]  And unfortunately, this family has made the decision to comply with that law.
[00:48:38.489 --> 00:48:41.190]  Unfortunately, and they paid the ultimate price for that.
[00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:42.730]  We know what they're going to do, Eric.
[00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.131]  They're going to take our guns and replace them with cameras.
[00:48:45.171 --> 00:48:46.571]  This has been their solution.
[00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:50.452]  Cameras, microphones, this is how they're going to stop crime.
[00:48:50.692 --> 00:48:54.093]  When you go into an area, in fact, a lot of areas here in Texas where you know the...
[00:48:54.793 --> 00:48:56.935]  Homeowners and the people are armed to the teeth.
[00:48:57.635 --> 00:49:04.981]  Of course, there's a great part of Florida that does this and towns that actually require mandatory gun ownership to even live in the town.
[00:49:05.202 --> 00:49:10.786]  These are the safest places to live, and you can talk all you want about gun death statistics.
[00:49:10.826 --> 00:49:13.468]  Yeah, people are going to use guns irresponsibly.
[00:49:13.749 --> 00:49:14.870]  We give up our guns.
[00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:16.411]  They're replaced with cameras.
[00:49:16.491 --> 00:49:22.676]  Of course, the crooks will always still get these black market guns, and we will have nothing left to defend ourselves against.
[00:49:22.856 --> 00:49:35.935]  Whether they be crooks trying to take our food and our water during a Hurricane Katrina event, whether they be cops or global cops or UN cops for the global takeover, we've got to keep ourselves armed to back these people off.
[00:49:36.275 --> 00:49:38.478]  Again, your website is gunowners.com.
[00:49:39.719 --> 00:49:39.919]  .org.
[00:49:39.959 --> 00:49:41.000]  GunOwners.org.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:41.860]  That's why I asked.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.081]  GunOwners.org.
[00:49:43.121 --> 00:49:46.082]  I can never get those Tom Straits, Nets, Orgs straight.
[00:49:46.302 --> 00:49:51.525]  GunOwners.org, and I assume that you guys have a lot of suggestions for what people can do about this.
[00:49:51.765 --> 00:49:54.286]  I'm telling you, right now, they are getting inundated.
[00:49:54.306 --> 00:49:56.467]  There are 8 million or 80 million gun owners.
[00:49:56.667 --> 00:49:57.969]  Absolutely, Jack, and I appreciate that suggestion.
[00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:04.197]  I encourage folks to go to our website at gunowners.org and sign up for our free email alerts, and we will keep you up to date with what's going on.
[00:50:16.451 --> 00:50:17.271]  With this issue.
[00:50:17.692 --> 00:50:39.178]  And like I said earlier, you can just look at one of the top links at the top of our page where we discuss this conference coming up and make it easy for people with some pre-written language to their senator to ask your senators to sign on to the David Vitter legislation because I would sure like to stop my tax money from going to the United Nations.
[00:50:39.438 --> 00:50:47.048]  Even if you don't own a gun, which is kind of crazy, but even if you're not owning a gun, you want to keep that right available, certainly.
[00:50:47.068 --> 00:50:47.329]  Amen.
[00:50:47.469 --> 00:50:48.790]  Gunowners.org.
[00:50:48.911 --> 00:50:50.252]  Eric Pratt, thanks for joining us.
[00:50:50.292 --> 00:50:51.174]  Appreciate the time, man.
[00:50:51.194 --> 00:50:51.714]  Thank you, Jack.
[00:50:51.734 --> 00:50:52.355]  It's been a pleasure.
[00:50:52.395 --> 00:50:53.617]  We'll be right back after this, folks.
[00:50:53.637 --> 00:50:54.578]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:54.858 --> 00:50:55.940]  Infowars.com.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.041]  Prisonplanet.com.
[00:50:57.061 --> 00:50:57.502]  Stay tuned.
[00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:08.441]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.741 --> 00:51:10.141]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:12.522]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.662 --> 00:51:14.742]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.043 --> 00:51:19.984]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.304 --> 00:51:24.325]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.585 --> 00:51:26.366]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.426 --> 00:51:37.091]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.231 --> 00:51:39.132]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.332 --> 00:51:43.214]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:51:43.294 --> 00:51:44.735]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:52:06.735 --> 00:52:08.976]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:52:09.056 --> 00:52:12.178]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:52:12.218 --> 00:52:16.501]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:52:16.841 --> 00:52:19.863]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:52:20.184 --> 00:52:23.606]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:52:23.946 --> 00:52:33.289]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:37.050]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:44.392]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[00:54:02.527 --> 00:54:05.269]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:05.289 --> 00:54:09.152]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:34.595 --> 00:54:37.057]  Well, a very, very important issue, isn't that?
[00:54:37.557 --> 00:54:43.421]  How nice of the United Nations to take the day of our independence to discuss our slavery.
[00:54:44.508 --> 00:54:46.309]  That really takes the cake, doesn't it, folks?
[00:54:46.329 --> 00:54:49.029]  If that doesn't upset you, I don't know what will.
[00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:51.250]  What is your line in the sand?
[00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.170]  I mean, that's a question that's often asked.
[00:54:53.230 --> 00:55:03.773]  And if gun control or gun confiscation or gun registration doesn't bother you and isn't your line in the sand, then you just don't know what is important.
[00:55:03.813 --> 00:55:06.634]  Your priorities are completely out of whack.
[00:55:06.654 --> 00:55:10.035]  So we want you to inundate Bolton, the United Nations.
[00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:17.253]  I'm a little more, well, let's just face it, I have no confidence in Bolton and Bush to protect your gun ownership rights.
[00:55:18.133 --> 00:55:21.476]  But this is a piece of incrementalism.
[00:55:21.496 --> 00:55:23.777]  They're not just going to grab them on July 5th.
[00:55:23.857 --> 00:55:31.302]  They're going to put together rules, laws, plans to incrementally scale back gun ownership here in this country and around the world.
[00:55:31.402 --> 00:55:33.083]  But this has to be your line in the sand.
[00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:34.711]  I think that's the proper term.
[00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:35.071]  Firearms.
[00:55:57.317 --> 00:56:00.900]  But that won't be happening much longer unless you stand up to this, folks.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:17.131]  And I know there's a lot of things you've got to do and a lot of things you've got to stand up to, but something like subdermal implantable microchips to track and trace you, something like the no-work lists, the employee verification bills coming out, that's very, very important, and something like gun ownership.
[00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:19.613]  There's just really not much more important than that.
[00:56:20.533 --> 00:56:23.936]  That dictates you to drop what you're doing and get right on this.
[00:56:23.996 --> 00:56:29.401]  Speaking of inundating people, I might have some good news to announce about C-SPAN.
[00:56:29.461 --> 00:56:42.073]  Yesterday, we told you to get on C-SPAN, to get on the Washington Bureau show in the morning, to write them at their website, write to the editorial directors, and make it known that you want them to cover the 9-11 conference.
[00:56:43.475 --> 00:56:45.198]  In Los Angeles this weekend.
[00:56:45.218 --> 00:56:47.543]  We're starting to hear that they're cracking.
[00:56:47.603 --> 00:56:48.665]  They might be breaking.
[00:56:48.946 --> 00:56:51.171]  That means you need to turn up the heat even more.
[00:56:52.043 --> 00:56:59.906]  You can go to C-SPAN's website and fill out a complaint form, or you can call their offices, and you just keep letting them know.
[00:57:00.306 --> 00:57:03.788]  We're getting very close, though, and we could get some major coverage as well.
[00:57:03.968 --> 00:57:13.412]  Just want to let you know real quick, obviously, one of the best tools to wake people up going today are Alex Jones' documentary films, and it's nice...
[00:57:14.552 --> 00:57:18.633]  It's nice to hear Alex say it, but obviously it sounds like he's maybe tooting his own horn.
[00:57:18.673 --> 00:57:22.755]  I'll tell you from an outside perspective, I've used these films for years.
[00:57:23.095 --> 00:57:33.198]  I've given them to people that were strong Bush supporters, some even Masons, low-level Masons, and they now are calling for a revolution because of these films.
[00:57:33.478 --> 00:57:34.918]  They hit you where they live.
[00:57:35.138 --> 00:57:38.299]  Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, Alex's last film.
[00:57:38.339 --> 00:57:39.880]  I happen to have a little cameo in that.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:47.023]  Shows you what the coronation was like in New York, the police state of New York, during the 2004 coronation.
[00:57:47.203 --> 00:57:48.284]  They called it a convention.
[00:57:49.124 --> 00:57:54.887]  It also goes into state-sponsored terrorism, covers new information about 9-11.
[00:57:55.227 --> 00:57:57.568]  It is a great film, still very valid.
[00:57:57.628 --> 00:58:05.232]  Talks about the cult of death, talks about the Bush family connections to the Nazi party, Prescott Bush funding the Nazis.
[00:58:05.905 --> 00:58:08.547]  Just a great, great film, a great documentary.
[00:58:08.748 --> 00:58:11.310]  That's available as is all of Alex's films.
[00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.271]  9-11 Road to Tyranny, still valid.
[00:58:13.372 --> 00:58:14.613]  Order of Death, still valid.
[00:58:14.913 --> 00:58:16.935]  Of course, the Police State video, still great.

[00:58:32.563 --> 00:58:37.925]  We're going to take a quick break, come back, take a few calls possibly, and then Colonel Ron Ray will join us.
[00:58:37.945 --> 00:58:38.425]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:41.566 --> 00:58:46.228]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.203 --> 00:58:58.843]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.504 --> 00:59:00.564]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.285 --> 00:59:02.365]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.046 --> 00:59:03.846]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:05.527]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.168 --> 00:59:09.850]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:14.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.354 --> 00:59:19.876]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show coming your way.
[00:59:22.444 --> 00:59:23.544]  22nd day of June 2006.
[00:59:24.445 --> 00:59:27.446]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today and tomorrow.
[00:59:27.506 --> 00:59:29.667]  I assume Alex will be back on Monday.
[00:59:29.687 --> 00:59:36.890]  He is clearing the way for you in Los Angeles, making sure that this is the best 9-11 conference you've ever attended.
[00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:38.570]  I don't see how it won't be.
[00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:41.031]  I've been calling it the Super Bowl of 9-11 conferences.
[00:59:41.071 --> 00:59:43.752]  Really looking forward to meeting everybody out there.
[00:59:44.252 --> 00:59:46.013]  Colonel Ron Ray will be joining us.
[00:59:46.533 --> 00:59:47.934]  You're not going to want to miss this, folks.
[00:59:47.994 --> 00:59:48.514]  He is...
[00:59:49.094 --> 00:59:54.515]  A Vietnam combat veteran won two silver stars, a bronze star, and a purple heart.
[00:59:55.355 --> 00:59:58.056]  That's just part of his extensive resume.
[00:59:58.376 --> 01:00:00.596]  Colonel Ronald Ray joining us here in the next segment.
[01:00:00.616 --> 01:00:03.216]  I want to take a few of your calls before we go to our guest.
[01:00:03.536 --> 01:00:05.417]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:06.537]  Robert, thank you for holding.
[01:00:06.557 --> 01:00:07.677]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:08.577]  Hi, Jack.
[01:00:08.597 --> 01:00:09.437]  You're doing a great job.
[01:00:09.598 --> 01:00:09.958]  Thank you.
[01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:15.759]  I went to Save the Internet yesterday after you guys recorded that, and I put my whole emailing list on it.
[01:00:16.239 --> 01:00:16.659]  Atta boy.
[01:00:17.039 --> 01:00:18.179]  Everybody was thankful to get that.
[01:00:18.595 --> 01:00:19.896]  But I wanted to hit a couple things.
[01:00:19.976 --> 01:00:26.161]  The total orchestration this week for Bush's falling polling numbers, you know, to hide the mass destruction of our economy.
[01:00:26.201 --> 01:00:28.183]  It's so transparent that it's goofy.
[01:00:28.663 --> 01:00:32.026]  I'm trying to figure out, are they this stupid or are they this arrogant?
[01:00:32.447 --> 01:00:33.347]  National draft.
[01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:38.852]  I mean, dude, the list is so long, I could go on for a long time just listing all their corruption.
[01:00:39.072 --> 01:00:44.537]  And then, of course, Karl Rove gets bailed out by Patrick Fitzgerald for the corrupt cover-up investigation.
[01:00:44.577 --> 01:00:45.738]  Just another Kenneth Starr.
[01:00:46.889 --> 01:00:52.217]  Then we have more FEMA tests going on for Megan in New Orleans so we can grab more guns.
[01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:56.503]  A juvenile curfew being set for New Orleans?
[01:00:56.883 --> 01:00:57.704]  It's so obvious.
[01:00:57.724 --> 01:01:00.929]  I've never seen such a consistent day-after-day ramp-up
[01:01:02.338 --> 01:01:05.559]  This is why we called this, Robert, about a month ago.
[01:01:05.619 --> 01:01:07.600]  This was tagged the Summer of Fear.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.382]  Not that we're afraid, but they're trying to make us afraid.
[01:01:10.602 --> 01:01:15.945]  They want fear to win this midterm election, and they're going to do everything they can to scare us right out of our tennis shoes.
[01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:19.867]  Yeah, here's their crown on this week's propaganda.
[01:01:21.448 --> 01:01:22.809]  Was probably already dead.
[01:01:22.889 --> 01:01:27.793]  And if he wasn't, he sure looked good after having a couple 500-pound bombs dropped on his head, don't you think?
[01:01:28.014 --> 01:01:28.234]  Right.
[01:01:28.674 --> 01:01:30.476]  He was dead, but who's counting?
[01:01:30.816 --> 01:01:38.803]  Okay, so Abu Hamza, the new guy, steps up to the plate like all secret terrorists do, announced, I'm the next guy to get, hello.
[01:01:38.823 --> 01:01:43.446]  He looks like a nice, clean-cut, color picture in the paper, CIA, Harvard grad.
[01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.308]  That's what I see when I look at it.
[01:01:46.729 --> 01:01:47.610]  Talking about Masrii?
[01:01:48.226 --> 01:01:49.467]  Yeah, the new guy who's taken over.
[01:01:49.507 --> 01:01:51.607]  Yeah, who's already started beheading soldiers.
[01:01:51.627 --> 01:01:53.088]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I was just going to get to.
[01:01:53.128 --> 01:01:57.590]  So he immediately steps up and claims, you know, I just captured and tortured your guys.
[01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.770]  I'm the next guy.
[01:01:58.790 --> 01:01:59.831]  I'm shaking my spear.
[01:01:59.851 --> 01:02:01.091]  Ooga booga, you know.
[01:02:01.572 --> 01:02:02.612]  I'm the next boogeyman.
[01:02:02.632 --> 01:02:04.513]  When the fact of the matter is... I'm a straw man.
[01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:06.694]  I'm out there, and your president can only save me.
[01:02:06.754 --> 01:02:13.676]  When the fact of the matter is, jihadists who are real Quran-studying Muslims do not torture people.
[01:02:13.937 --> 01:02:15.217]  They do not torture the dead.
[01:02:15.257 --> 01:02:17.058]  That is one of the things they cannot do.
[01:02:17.498 --> 01:02:19.139]  But again, this is what we have.
[01:02:19.159 --> 01:02:23.382]  In fact, Kurt Nimmo has written a great story about this that is at PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[01:02:23.642 --> 01:02:26.504]  Beheaded soldiers, the new Zakao, he strikes in short order.
[01:02:26.964 --> 01:02:28.745]  Exactly, but what does that come after?
[01:02:28.765 --> 01:02:37.971]  That comes one day after they also announced that, you know, some of our little cowboy robot rangers went on quite the killing spree of so-called unarmed civilians.
[01:02:38.632 --> 01:02:44.575]  Sean Hannity and Michael Savage spent all day yesterday talking about their insurgents, their fifth columnists.
[01:02:44.656 --> 01:02:46.757]  There are no civilians, just insurgents.
[01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:51.585]  Hey, I'm not going to say that our troops deserve to be killed and tortured.
[01:02:51.705 --> 01:02:53.985]  I don't ever want to say that, but I will say this.
[01:02:54.045 --> 01:02:55.246]  You get what you pay for.
[01:02:55.526 --> 01:02:56.266]  It's a setup.
[01:02:56.646 --> 01:02:58.966]  It's an orchestration of how they're delivering the media.
[01:02:59.186 --> 01:03:00.047]  D-U-O-G.
[01:03:00.267 --> 01:03:00.467]  Yep.
[01:03:01.247 --> 01:03:04.227]  England, that's 100% success for the new rule of order.
[01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:04.808]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:05.068 --> 01:03:05.268]  Yep.
[01:03:05.428 --> 01:03:08.728]  The total crime, destruction, taking their guns, that's 100% success.
[01:03:08.748 --> 01:03:09.809]  That's what they want everywhere.
[01:03:09.889 --> 01:03:11.109]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:03:11.369 --> 01:03:11.729]  The U.N.
[01:03:11.749 --> 01:03:12.649]  will come in and save you.
[01:03:13.049 --> 01:03:14.229]  Robert, I've got to jump next.
[01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:14.850]  I've got a lot of calls.
[01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:16.870]  Are we going to see you at the American Scholar Symposium?
[01:03:18.156 --> 01:03:24.241]  I'm doing a film right now for my summer break in college, so I can't make it, but I'm going to hopefully get to hear all about it.
[01:03:24.782 --> 01:03:25.963]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[01:03:26.504 --> 01:03:29.987]  Jesse, Mark, William, everybody patiently holding.
[01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:30.808]  We're going to get to you.
[01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:31.909]  We've got to go to our guest.
[01:03:31.929 --> 01:03:33.010]  You're going to want to hear him.
[01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:36.193]  Colonel Ronald Ray, Marine retired...
[01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:44.766]  Army war veteran, Marine war veteran, two silver stars, a bronze star, a purple heart, and he knows exactly what's going on.
[01:03:44.786 --> 01:03:45.967]  He'll join us in the next segment.
[01:03:45.987 --> 01:03:46.428]  Stay tuned.
[01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:47.470]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:49.453]  I'm Jack Blood, InfoWars.com.
[01:03:54.582 --> 01:04:01.949]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:06.974]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:07.194 --> 01:04:12.840]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.560]  We're good to go.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.181]  We're good to go.
[01:04:28.234 --> 01:04:28.434]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:57.305]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:57.665 --> 01:05:06.488]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:06.808 --> 01:05:11.490]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:18.673]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:19.073 --> 01:05:30.838]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:31.338 --> 01:05:35.801]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:35.961 --> 01:05:38.422]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:38.442 --> 01:05:40.263]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.283 --> 01:05:41.424]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.564 --> 01:05:43.024]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:43.044 --> 01:05:44.085]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.862]  Hey, Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[01:05:58.202 --> 01:05:59.023]  And check this out.
[01:05:59.343 --> 01:06:00.244]  I bought a new car.
[01:06:00.324 --> 01:06:05.569]  Wow, John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:10.253]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:15.497]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:06:15.918 --> 01:06:18.380]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.023]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[01:06:22.263 --> 01:06:23.164]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[01:06:23.504 --> 01:06:25.906]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[01:06:26.246 --> 01:06:28.508]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[01:06:28.628 --> 01:06:29.288]  It's incredible.
[01:06:29.668 --> 01:06:37.134]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[01:06:37.454 --> 01:06:42.377]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:43.698]  Check, please.
[01:06:44.159 --> 01:06:45.039]  I got this one, Bill.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.120]  Sure, John.
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:50.844]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:51.004 --> 01:06:51.264]  Deal.
[01:06:54.057 --> 01:06:59.702]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.428 --> 01:07:09.089]  Well, this happens in radio.
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:13.973]  Apparently, there was a miscommunication on the time zones.
[01:07:15.014 --> 01:07:19.958]  We're trying to track down Colonel Ron Ray, and hopefully we'll get him on during today's program.
[01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:20.438]  If not...
[01:07:20.762 --> 01:07:23.983]  You're going to have to look for him on this show because this guy is just a hell of a guy.
[01:07:24.003 --> 01:07:41.111]  He does a great job and I'm really looking forward to having him on because it's always great to have these major military guys on who hangs out with all the generals, knows all the inside information, highly accredited, highly verified as an authority in war fighting.
[01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:42.772]  It's always good to have these guys on.
[01:07:43.513 --> 01:07:45.876]  To articulate our dilemma.
[01:07:45.936 --> 01:07:48.700]  So we'll hope we can get Ron Ray during the program today.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.804]  If not, I know there'll be a rebooking and he'll come back and join us.
[01:07:52.164 --> 01:07:54.848]  That means we get to go to your calls and cover a lot of news.
[01:07:54.888 --> 01:07:58.753]  There is just no lack of news and information we're trying to get out to you.
[01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:01.874]  Phone lines, I believe there might be one open.
[01:08:01.914 --> 01:08:05.676]  If not, when somebody drops, you can get in.
[01:08:05.696 --> 01:08:06.156]  800-259-9231.
[01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:08.557]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[01:08:08.637 --> 01:08:11.558]  Anything you want to talk about at this point, let's go to the phones.
[01:08:11.698 --> 01:08:13.719]  Jesse in Nevada, thank you for holding.
[01:08:13.759 --> 01:08:14.839]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:15.079 --> 01:08:15.760]  How are you, Jack?
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.300]  Okay.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:20.521]  I'm really excited about tomorrow, and I'm sorry, Saturday and Sunday, but I'm leaving tomorrow.
[01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:21.202]  Okay.
[01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:25.083]  I wanted to preface this call with that I know how to call a spade a spade.
[01:08:25.203 --> 01:08:27.164]  I don't have any qualms with having a spade.
[01:08:27.751 --> 01:08:30.973]  Firm belief about what really transpired in September on 2001.
[01:08:32.114 --> 01:08:37.717]  With that said, I wanted to see if there's a way we can touch on a few things that need some attention, in my opinion.
[01:08:38.137 --> 01:08:38.397]  Okay.
[01:08:38.597 --> 01:08:44.701]  Some of the people I've talked to have two things, one of them being a mainstream argument, another being about politics.
[01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:54.507]  The first was the mainstream argument was that the temperature of the plane when colliding with the buildings, because it was an enclosed space, that the temperature had some sort of a flashpoint of
[01:08:55.245 --> 01:08:59.268]  Multiple thousands of degrees, and the argument was that it kind of soldered the iron.
[01:08:59.308 --> 01:09:08.115]  I don't buy it, because especially the way the buildings fell, I mean, I know they were explosives, but I would like somebody to explain that, and I'm going to ask Stephen Jones about that, obviously.
[01:09:08.255 --> 01:09:11.658]  That would be the top expert in that particular question.
[01:09:11.838 --> 01:09:14.080]  And if he doesn't know the answer, maybe he can find out for us.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:19.624]  The other one is, I think we, there probably is a lot of information about this.
[01:09:19.644 --> 01:09:20.665]  I've just not found it.
[01:09:20.685 --> 01:09:22.627]  I don't know where to look.
[01:09:23.686 --> 01:09:34.131]  The political party system, how there's supposedly checks and balances between one another, and how the mantra in Washington is that you stay in your seat.
[01:09:34.752 --> 01:09:35.752]  That's the whole goal.
[01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:41.055]  You do anything to stay in your seat, so you do anything to out somebody else.
[01:09:41.335 --> 01:09:42.155]  I know about the corruption.
[01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:44.216]  Like I said, I know how to call a spade a spade.
[01:09:44.236 --> 01:09:45.677]  I know what really transpired that time.
[01:09:46.077 --> 01:09:49.719]  But I would like us to possibly, somebody out there, to focus on that.
[01:09:49.839 --> 01:09:51.040]  And I'm trying to focus on that.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.081]  Maybe I'm not smart enough.
[01:09:53.141 --> 01:09:53.421]  I don't know.
[01:09:53.996 --> 01:09:54.916]  Well, be specific.
[01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:56.677]  What do you think we should focus on?
[01:09:56.717 --> 01:09:58.198]  I mean, be very specific here.
[01:09:58.238 --> 01:09:59.979]  Well, we have so many answers already.
[01:10:00.479 --> 01:10:08.403]  What I'm specifically talking about is how there would be whistleblowers within the government telling on each other if this had transpired.
[01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:09.263]  And there are.
[01:10:09.423 --> 01:10:11.424]  I get that, but I'm talking about with Congress.
[01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:20.017]  You know, why aren't those guys going after each other to, you know, especially the Democrats who hate, supposedly, hate the President and want to get him out?
[01:10:20.037 --> 01:10:29.982]  Sure, that's a really logical question, but when you see that they're all paid off by the same people and all controlled by the same people, then that really answers your own question, doesn't it?
[01:10:30.002 --> 01:10:37.725]  I mean, Cynthia McKinney, who's not controlled, Ron Paul, who are not controlled, have managed to bring this into some of the debates.
[01:10:37.745 --> 01:10:40.707]  Cynthia McKinney, who held a panel to look into 9-11...
[01:10:42.027 --> 01:10:49.130]  Being very, very careful where she steps, certainly, is, I know, personally interested in getting a lot of emails.
[01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:54.452]  In fact, I've talked to her off the air and very interested in all the evidence and a lot of the new evidence.
[01:10:54.532 --> 01:10:55.692]  And she's a pit bull.
[01:10:55.712 --> 01:11:00.154]  I mean, when she gets something, in fact, we've got to get her this if she doesn't already have it.
[01:11:00.174 --> 01:11:03.935]  And that is, as you mentioned, Professor Stephen Jones' new analysis.
[01:11:04.295 --> 01:11:11.838]  Where he found a thermite definitely used at the World Trade Center to cut those buildings and to cause that demolition.
[01:11:11.858 --> 01:11:14.879]  And then that, of course, dictates an inside job.
[01:11:14.919 --> 01:11:23.962]  So here you've got an esteemed physics professor at BYU analyzing what's left of the evidence, saying, no, the heat wasn't hot enough, as you mentioned earlier.
[01:11:24.202 --> 01:11:30.224]  We have to remember there were people literally in the giant airplane holes minutes after the plane hit, okay?
[01:11:30.264 --> 01:11:33.085]  People that were alive and who weren't burned to death.
[01:11:33.825 --> 01:11:35.646]  But Stephen Jones has proven this.
[01:11:35.866 --> 01:11:38.027]  Cynthia McKinney is getting information like this.
[01:11:38.047 --> 01:11:43.110]  She's getting Richard Andrew Grove's information as well.
[01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:59.717]  So we have people getting the information, but unfortunately, and this is what we all know, whether it's APAC or Abramoff or GE or Lockheed Martin or what have you, they are so deep into the pockets of these guys that they just don't dare speak out.
[01:11:59.877 --> 01:12:01.438]  And these are the people we need to get rid of.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.481]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:11.107]  And I wanted to add, you know, just not to beat it to death, but I mean, the argument is, well, Nixon was, you know, something as simple as Watergate.
[01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:13.829]  I mean, gee, you know, something, a grand conspiracy.
[01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:16.772]  You know, someone would blow to us on that, obviously, you know.
[01:12:16.792 --> 01:12:22.657]  Well, we have centralized government, and government has been bought off much more than in the Nixon administration.
[01:12:22.677 --> 01:12:30.223]  And just remember, if we didn't have Daniel Ellsberg and people like that back in the Nixon administration, he would have gotten away with all of that.
[01:12:30.683 --> 01:12:37.570]  Yeah, and so what I'm saying is I would like, and maybe I need to do this myself, I would like some sort of detailed report talking about that.
[01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:45.299]  You know, I mean, saying, well, here's an instance where it wasn't leaked, and here's an instance where it wasn't leaked, and secrets can be kept, and there is no check and balance.
[01:12:46.556 --> 01:12:47.377]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:12:47.417 --> 01:12:47.957]  I understand.
[01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:49.077]  I hear your frustration.
[01:12:49.137 --> 01:12:49.838]  I understand.
[01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:52.980]  Honestly, there are a million articles like this already.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.363]  All you need to do is hit your Google up or hit up your search engine and you'll find that information.
[01:12:58.423 --> 01:13:02.225]  If we had time, I could just sit and do a whole show on this and run it down for you.
[01:13:02.725 --> 01:13:09.150]  The fact of the matter is, people are identifying the corruption, and it ain't the dog wagging the tail.
[01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.072]  It's the tail wagging the dog.
[01:13:11.272 --> 01:13:15.556]  Our government doesn't allow these lobbyists to come in and control them.
[01:13:15.776 --> 01:13:26.184]  They have been so controlled by the lobbyists for so long, and these include the international banks, the central banks, etc., that they are completely owned, lock, stock, and bagel, by these people.
[01:13:26.305 --> 01:13:27.345]  It's just the bottom line.
[01:13:27.365 --> 01:13:27.906]  And if we don't...
[01:13:28.226 --> 01:13:31.548]  Look, if you want a solution, I'm going to give you one.
[01:13:31.568 --> 01:13:38.373]  We need total disclosure by everyone in Congress, everyone in the Senate, everyone in government making policy.
[01:13:38.453 --> 01:13:48.959]  Bottom line, total disclosure so that we can see for ourselves who's in their pockets, who's controlling them, who their masters are, and at that point we can decide whether to keep them in office or not.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.240]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:50.721]  I appreciate it.
[01:13:50.741 --> 01:13:51.401]  You got it, Jesse.
[01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:52.302]  Keep the faith, man.
[01:13:52.562 --> 01:13:55.464]  Mark is calling us from somewhere.
[01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:56.845]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:13:56.905 --> 01:13:57.525]  Thank you for calling.
[01:13:59.466 --> 01:13:59.806]  Atlanta.
[01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:01.347]  Hold on, there we go.
[01:14:01.387 --> 01:14:02.367]  Yeah, Mark in Georgia.
[01:14:02.427 --> 01:14:03.187]  Thank you for calling, man.
[01:14:03.207 --> 01:14:04.088]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:04.448 --> 01:14:05.748]  Yeah, I just had to kill the speaker there.
[01:14:06.268 --> 01:14:26.455]  Yeah, you know, a while back I attended this cult awareness conference, and one of the tactics that cults use to keep their victims thinking that they're the chosen remnant and they're the only place where they can get the truth is a tactic called loaded language, where there is some kind of a subliminal message.
[01:14:26.675 --> 01:14:28.176]  Talking about neurolinguistics?
[01:14:28.726 --> 01:14:52.210]  Well, yeah, and it's like every time I hear, you know, on those rare occasions when somebody calls in these many truth media cartel talk shows, I'm like, with every ad hominem attack that I hear, it just further convinces me that there is a conspiracy, and there are people who just don't know better.
[01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:57.951]  But the term conspiracy theory, I am convinced, is a loaded term to keep people from thinking...
[01:14:58.191 --> 01:14:59.231]  But why is that?
[01:14:59.311 --> 01:15:00.972]  Why do people fall for that?
[01:15:01.052 --> 01:15:06.073]  Because there's nothing wrong with loading up a theory about a conspiracy.
[01:15:06.113 --> 01:15:07.273]  Conspiracies are bad.
[01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:08.514]  Conspiracies exist.
[01:15:08.854 --> 01:15:13.195]  In order to arrive at a conclusion, there has to be an investigation.
[01:15:13.255 --> 01:15:18.216]  Part of an investigation involves putting together theories and then proving those theories.
[01:15:18.276 --> 01:15:22.837]  So it's amazing to me that that carries such a negative vibe to it.
[01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:25.278]  Well, the thing is that it's not something...
[01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:34.360]  And that's one of the points I have to calling into these programs to point out that tactic is that people are not aware of how they're being manipulated.
[01:15:34.861 --> 01:15:42.846]  And the thing is, the point I would make to these people is the most outrageous conspiracy theory I've found is the officially sacked one.
[01:15:43.987 --> 01:15:44.207]  Right?
[01:15:44.728 --> 01:15:50.192]  Well, but see, that's why we're not conspiracy theorists as much as we are conspiracy debunkers.
[01:15:50.737 --> 01:15:55.140]  Well, or... I would... Conspiracy researchers, counter-conspiracy advocates.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.883]  But like I say, the whole point is that people are being manipulated.
[01:15:58.903 --> 01:15:59.043]  Yeah.
[01:15:59.703 --> 01:16:00.283]  And they are not...
[01:16:02.267 --> 01:16:07.909]  Well, you know that Tony Robbins actually coaches several presidents, has coached several presidents in the past.
[01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:22.756]  He has written the handbook on neurolinguistics, and this is, again, using imagery in order to get things into people's heads, using a phrase repeated over and over again, as Bush likes to say, to propel the propaganda.
[01:16:23.116 --> 01:16:29.659]  So, yes, this is being used on a very high-tech level, and you better believe that whether it's on radio and particularly on TV...
[01:16:30.359 --> 01:16:40.544]  There are little mind control programs running in order to drill in certain ideas into you, and one of those ideas you brought up, that there's something bad about being a conspiracy theorist.
[01:16:42.185 --> 01:16:43.165]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[01:16:43.205 --> 01:16:43.825]  You must have dropped.
[01:16:44.106 --> 01:16:47.407]  William in New Mexico, thank you for calling, and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:16:47.927 --> 01:16:48.868]  Taking my call, Jack.
[01:16:49.248 --> 01:16:49.688]  You got it.
[01:16:50.989 --> 01:16:55.111]  You know, you were talking about where is your personal line in the sand earlier?
[01:16:55.331 --> 01:16:55.551]  Yeah.
[01:16:56.151 --> 01:16:57.712]  Well, mine was crossed on November 22, 1963.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.162]  And I think we've all been kind of in terror.
[01:17:03.382 --> 01:17:07.605]  One of many coups, bloody coups in this country.
[01:17:08.966 --> 01:17:11.128]  And that was the first of the big ones, I think.
[01:17:11.588 --> 01:17:13.290]  Yeah.
[01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:17.553]  I wanted to run an idea past you and your listeners.
[01:17:18.153 --> 01:17:18.974]  Go right ahead.
[01:17:19.794 --> 01:17:22.577]  You know, it's possible in the United States, the U.S.
[01:17:22.617 --> 01:17:28.341]  Postal Service and Canada Post also, to design your own stamps.
[01:17:29.909 --> 01:17:34.712]  You know, I've heard that, and that would be a great idea.
[01:17:34.732 --> 01:17:37.133]  I have to hand it to you, William.
[01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:39.534]  You really came up with a good one there.
[01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.776]  And what would you put on your stamp?
[01:17:53.081 --> 01:17:58.484]  Oh, probably 9-11, inside job, sort of graphic on it.
[01:17:58.744 --> 01:18:06.388]  Now, do you think your letter to Grandma, and people don't even mail much anymore, but do you think your letter to Grandma would be delivered with that stamp?
[01:18:06.408 --> 01:18:07.309]  They'd actually deliver it?
[01:18:07.909 --> 01:18:09.570]  If my grandmothers were alive, yes.
[01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:11.771]  I'm using that, of course, as an example.
[01:18:12.611 --> 01:18:14.012]  They'd actually deliver the mail?
[01:18:15.493 --> 01:18:16.473]  On the U.S.
[01:18:16.513 --> 01:18:17.214]  Postal Service.
[01:18:17.274 --> 01:18:18.915]  Or would it get conveniently off?
[01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:21.376]  There aren't any limitations listed.
[01:18:23.123 --> 01:18:25.727]  No, I'm saying it might get conveniently lost.
[01:18:25.807 --> 01:18:26.748]  Let me tell you something.
[01:18:27.068 --> 01:18:29.692]  My mailman listens to the programs we do.
[01:18:29.852 --> 01:18:31.694]  He's a fan of our show.
[01:18:31.935 --> 01:18:35.860]  He'd deliver the original stamp saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:38.623]  Hey, I've got to tell you, William, that's a great idea, man.
[01:18:38.924 --> 01:18:40.426]  I think we're going to try to do something with that.
[01:18:40.945 --> 01:18:45.147]  There's a lot of talented artists on REST.com that do splash screens.
[01:18:45.207 --> 01:18:46.967]  Maybe one of them is listening.
[01:18:46.987 --> 01:18:50.229]  I'm going to guarantee you people are going to start doing that right now since you put that out.
[01:18:50.249 --> 01:18:51.189]  What a great suggestion.
[01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:52.090]  Thanks for the call, William.
[01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.770]  Stay tuned, folks.
[01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:56.551]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:57.072 --> 01:18:59.913]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:00.853 --> 01:19:10.457]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:15.195]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:15.175 --> 01:19:16.656]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:17.376 --> 01:19:28.200]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.341]  Star War technology at its best.
[01:19:32.221 --> 01:19:33.722]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[01:19:37.814 --> 01:19:41.496]  Or visit www.laysmedinc.com.
[01:19:42.096 --> 01:19:47.198]  That's www.l-a-s-e-m-e-d-i-n-c.com.
[01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:48.179]  Or call 792-953-0267.
[01:19:55.911 --> 01:19:56.952]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.353 --> 01:20:02.839]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:03.900]  That's right.
[01:20:04.221 --> 01:20:06.503]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:07.064 --> 01:20:13.992]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:22.254]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.674 --> 01:20:27.478]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:28.158 --> 01:20:33.580]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:38.102]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:38.482 --> 01:20:38.723]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.743 --> 01:20:40.683]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.743 --> 01:20:41.044]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.344 --> 01:20:41.624]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.955 --> 01:21:04.022]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:21:04.262 --> 01:21:15.510]  Black Fergie elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:20.674]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum...
[01:21:20.874 --> 01:21:21.335]  We're good to go.
[01:21:45.998 --> 01:21:46.198]  803-4438.
[01:21:46.218 --> 01:21:48.662]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:21:53.402 --> 01:21:55.023]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails.
[01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:59.406]  I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:21:59.806 --> 01:22:02.468]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:02.628 --> 01:22:07.251]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[01:22:07.411 --> 01:22:12.235]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:22:12.415 --> 01:22:17.158]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:22:17.378 --> 01:22:20.040]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.162]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:22:24.462 --> 01:22:25.282]  Looking for profit?
[01:22:25.522 --> 01:22:26.903]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:22:27.263 --> 01:22:30.463]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offered both.
[01:22:30.503 --> 01:22:37.744]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:41.625]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:22:41.885 --> 01:22:43.405]  Secure your position today.
[01:22:43.706 --> 01:22:44.826]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:44.986 --> 01:22:45.206]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:19.807 --> 01:23:23.110]  Robots patrol World Cup for the first time.
[01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:30.937]  Robots are being used to patrol the stadium at the World Cup for the first time, although they've hardly had a chance to show off what they can do.
[01:23:30.957 --> 01:23:41.447]  A Berlin company called RoboWatch has developed two models of surveillance robots, and 11 units between the two patrol parking lots underneath Berlin's
[01:23:43.208 --> 01:23:57.457]  This is the first time robots like this have ever been used as a major sporting event, RoboWatch Sports spokesman Benjamin Stengel said.
[01:23:57.955 --> 01:23:59.755]  Quote, they haven't caught anybody.
[01:23:59.996 --> 01:24:01.736]  They haven't actually had much to do.
[01:24:02.016 --> 01:24:05.237]  This is a very safe World Cup, luckily.
[01:24:05.277 --> 01:24:18.620]  The outdoor robot OFRO, O-F-R-O, which starts at $76,000 and resembles a Mars rover on treads, uses thermal cameras at night to spot intruders from their body heat.
[01:24:18.981 --> 01:24:20.481]  Similar to ones used by U.S.
[01:24:20.521 --> 01:24:24.282]  military as scouts in Iraq, the OFRO is capable of far more
[01:24:24.622 --> 01:24:30.343]  With sensors equipped to detect radiation, toxins, viruses, chemical warfare agents, etc.
[01:24:30.643 --> 01:24:37.844]  These things won't be used here, but we see this is a learning experience where we can go back and get better technology.
[01:24:37.884 --> 01:24:43.466]  Stengel said the robots here will be mostly used where it's very boring and very difficult to see.
[01:24:43.746 --> 01:24:51.307]  The robots get navigation help from global positioning satellite systems and send pictures back to a central room in the stadium called the Skybox.
[01:24:51.727 --> 01:24:56.609]  Though, through remote control, they can be sent to check out anything suspicious.
[01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:04.493]  A second robot, Moroso, is shaped like R2-D2 from Star Wars, so that will be nice and cuddly for everybody.
[01:25:04.873 --> 01:25:11.056]  The machine, which starts at $15,000, uses mostly video cameras to catch intruders in the parking lot.
[01:25:11.337 --> 01:25:14.038]  It also has infrared and ultrasonic sensors.
[01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:21.641]  Of course, we're all familiar with the Carlisle Group robots that are armed with machine guns, cameras, and microphones.
[01:25:21.741 --> 01:25:31.726]  And part of the problem with these soldiers, these robot soldiers, which have been predicted and articulated now for many years and are far more advanced than they're actually telling us,
[01:25:32.806 --> 01:25:36.188]  Is that they often shoot their own people.
[01:25:36.648 --> 01:25:40.030]  There's a lot of friendly fire incidents with these robots.
[01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:48.534]  And the only way the powers that be can figure out how to protect us from our own robots in war is, of course, to have your own.
[01:25:48.974 --> 01:25:50.295]  Subdermal microchip.
[01:25:50.315 --> 01:25:55.757]  This is just another excuse, another reason for us to all get chips so the robots won't shoot us.
[01:25:55.797 --> 01:25:57.898]  Sounds like I'm talking about the Terminator?
[01:25:58.218 --> 01:26:02.780]  It is reality, folks, and sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.361]  Let's go back to the phones.
[01:26:05.381 --> 01:26:05.621]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:26:05.881 --> 01:26:09.483]  I believe we have Daniel in Arizona.
[01:26:09.763 --> 01:26:11.043]  Daniel, thank you for calling in.
[01:26:11.063 --> 01:26:12.264]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:13.404 --> 01:26:13.764]  Hey, Jack.
[01:26:13.784 --> 01:26:14.965]  It's a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:26:15.566 --> 01:26:17.267]  I wanted to make a comment about 9-11.
[01:26:17.407 --> 01:26:25.472]  I've been following this thing for the last few years and probably come to similar conclusions as yourself and thousands of listeners.
[01:26:26.532 --> 01:26:30.214]  I watched a video, a history channel, something like that.
[01:26:30.674 --> 01:26:40.360]  It was before pre-9-11 and it was about the building of the World Trade Center complex, which was just a humongous structure, you know, the size that it took up.
[01:26:41.204 --> 01:26:43.786]  And it had a lot to do with David Rockefeller.
[01:26:43.806 --> 01:26:47.690]  It was pretty much his baby right after World War II.
[01:26:48.651 --> 01:26:52.053]  He spent 15, 20 years working on this dream.
[01:26:52.814 --> 01:26:54.896]  And it was very entertaining.
[01:26:54.996 --> 01:26:56.718]  It either was an hour or an hour and a half.
[01:26:56.738 --> 01:26:57.598]  It was fascinating.
[01:26:57.638 --> 01:27:00.000]  I've actually seen that documentary a while back, yeah.
[01:27:01.001 --> 01:27:08.227]  Well, after 9-11, I never saw this thing again, and I never even heard the name David Rockefeller come up.
[01:27:08.468 --> 01:27:08.688]  You know...
[01:27:09.346 --> 01:27:13.869]  Well, David Rockefeller and the Rockefeller Foundation is the Port Authority.
[01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:16.011]  I mean, what's there to hide here?
[01:27:16.051 --> 01:27:16.391]  I don't know.
[01:27:16.411 --> 01:27:18.633]  I mean, that's a common fact.
[01:27:18.673 --> 01:27:19.393]  Everybody knows that.
[01:27:20.594 --> 01:27:24.637]  Well, I just thought there would be an interview, a comment, something.
[01:27:24.657 --> 01:27:34.524]  You know, the name is just totally removed out of the public eye, and here's the man that created the entire assembly there of the buildings and land, the whole vehicle.
[01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:41.982]  Well, obviously it's not against the law to build buildings, and it doesn't even implicate him in 9-11, the fact that he built those buildings.
[01:27:42.242 --> 01:27:59.232]  But the fact that he did control large parts of the buildings and certainly a lot of the security of the buildings, and obviously David is not there watching it himself, David Rockefeller, but that particular group of people I think would point to some type of complicity in 9-11.
[01:27:59.272 --> 01:28:00.573]  Though, look, we know...
[01:28:01.323 --> 01:28:06.804]  David Rockefeller is worshipped by all of the neocons, and by the neoliberals as well.
[01:28:06.824 --> 01:28:13.465]  I mean, he is a classic neoliberal, of which most of the neocons were at one point, even a socialist and a communist.
[01:28:13.485 --> 01:28:24.827]  And I've seen David Rockefeller give speeches where, or be in attendance in speeches where Dick Cheney would be in attendance, and he would spend 20 minutes laying it on below and smoke up his skirt.
[01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:26.508]  They just worshipped the guy.
[01:28:26.528 --> 01:28:28.548]  I have a lot more to say about that if you want.
[01:28:29.468 --> 01:28:30.529]  Daniel, thanks for calling.
[01:28:30.569 --> 01:28:31.109]  Come right back.
[01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:32.470]  Take Linda, Patrick, and Chad.
[01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:32.890]  Stay tuned.
[01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:34.291]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:44.276 --> 01:28:45.177]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.677 --> 01:28:47.278]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:50.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:58.091]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[01:28:58.572 --> 01:29:00.752]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:06.615]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[01:29:07.155 --> 01:29:13.077]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[01:30:07.099 --> 01:30:10.582]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:30:10.842 --> 01:30:11.302]  We're good to go.
[01:30:31.972 --> 01:30:38.895]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:30:39.115 --> 01:30:41.776]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:44.417 --> 01:30:45.657]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:59.707]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.007 --> 01:31:04.710]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.031 --> 01:31:12.695]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.976 --> 01:31:19.820]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.421]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:45.808 --> 01:31:46.771]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:05.271 --> 01:32:18.559]  Well, yesterday we put a call out for you to get after C-SPAN, to really pressure them to cover this 9-11 event.
[01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:24.722]  That is the giant conference that Alex Jones is putting on this weekend that we're all going to.
[01:32:24.742 --> 01:32:26.163]  Hopefully you're going to.
[01:32:27.507 --> 01:32:35.115]  And we sicked some InfoWarriors on C-SPAN very politely and very respectfully and did a few info drive-bys.
[01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:40.640]  And I've just been told here in the InfoWar studio that C-SPAN will be covering the event.
[01:32:41.241 --> 01:32:41.701]  That's right.
[01:32:42.362 --> 01:32:49.910]  The message I got is that they will be filming some of the keynote speeches on Sunday and I believe airing those on C-SPAN.
[01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:51.031]  How's that for a victory?
[01:32:52.519 --> 01:32:55.380]  I want someone to call in now and say, there's nothing we can do.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.501]  I'm just one person.
[01:32:56.561 --> 01:32:57.421]  Nobody cares.
[01:32:58.062 --> 01:33:00.203]  We can't change the media's mind.
[01:33:00.223 --> 01:33:01.503]  They're going to do what they're going to do.
[01:33:02.103 --> 01:33:02.784]  They hate us.
[01:33:03.024 --> 01:33:03.384]  But look.
[01:33:04.512 --> 01:33:05.652]  We can do something.
[01:33:05.692 --> 01:33:06.853]  This is a giant victory.
[01:33:06.893 --> 01:33:10.593]  I want to thank everybody who called and pressured C-SPAN.
[01:33:10.613 --> 01:33:12.394]  I hope you are all really respectful.
[01:33:12.774 --> 01:33:16.574]  Obviously, whatever you did worked, because we've now got C-SPAN on board.
[01:33:16.774 --> 01:33:20.895]  And the BBC has also just checked in and said they'll be covering the event as well.
[01:33:21.335 --> 01:33:27.356]  So what I'd like you to do, if you have time, call C-SPAN or get a hold of them and just tell them thank you.
[01:33:27.396 --> 01:33:29.437]  We heard you're covering Alex Jones' 9-11 event.
[01:33:31.221 --> 01:33:34.483]  The Scholar Review, and thank them for doing that.
[01:33:34.923 --> 01:33:39.466]  Tell them that you are going to remain one of their listeners now.
[01:33:40.367 --> 01:33:43.909]  They've kept a listener, and you're going to tell everyone to watch this.
[01:33:44.309 --> 01:33:46.551]  And you hope they air the whole thing in entirety.
[01:33:46.571 --> 01:33:51.114]  You're going to have all your friends, your family watch this, and they're all going to be loving C-SPAN for that.
[01:33:51.894 --> 01:33:56.017]  They aired David Ray Griffin's speech, maybe just once, about a year ago.
[01:33:56.792 --> 01:33:58.973]  David Ray Griffin, of course, the new Pearl Harbor.
[01:33:59.273 --> 01:34:00.353]  A great book.
[01:34:00.753 --> 01:34:03.474]  So we can make them bend to our will.
[01:34:03.534 --> 01:34:04.894]  I guess is that too strong a word?
[01:34:05.895 --> 01:34:12.877]  We can quietly and respectfully wake them up to news, actual news, going on in this country.
[01:34:13.735 --> 01:34:16.295]  So that's a huge victory, and you should all be very proud of yourselves.
[01:34:16.355 --> 01:34:17.756]  Everybody that participated in that.
[01:34:18.176 --> 01:34:19.576]  And it feels good, doesn't it?
[01:34:19.636 --> 01:34:20.596]  Doesn't it feel good?
[01:34:21.236 --> 01:34:23.277]  You can call this a minor victory if you like.
[01:34:23.337 --> 01:34:23.817]  I don't care.
[01:34:23.877 --> 01:34:27.397]  But doesn't it feel good to be able to accomplish something together?
[01:34:27.437 --> 01:34:28.878]  There's a lot we can do together.
[01:34:29.158 --> 01:34:30.518]  Let's keep on keeping on.
[01:34:30.758 --> 01:34:32.258]  Let's go back to the phones.
[01:34:32.278 --> 01:34:33.959]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:34.039 --> 01:34:35.319]  Anything you want to talk about.
[01:34:35.619 --> 01:34:37.619]  We've got a lot of news here to report as well.
[01:34:37.959 --> 01:34:40.240]  Linda in Maryland, thank you so much for holding.
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.560]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:42.327 --> 01:34:42.908]  Hi, Jack.
[01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:49.553]  Maryland state government is proposing to widen Interstate 95.
[01:34:49.633 --> 01:34:51.174]  They're calling it Section 200.
[01:34:51.395 --> 01:35:02.003]  And the choices that they're giving the people are to do nothing and let the congestion remain the same, adding general purpose lanes and express toll lanes.
[01:35:02.104 --> 01:35:08.449]  Now, I know Alex has done shows on this, and I want to go to this meeting tonight and be able to drop a verbal bomb
[01:35:09.062 --> 01:35:11.906]  But it's been a while since I've heard what he had to say.
[01:35:11.926 --> 01:35:16.972]  The toll lanes are pretty self-explanatory because I'm sure that they're going to be privatized.
[01:35:17.052 --> 01:35:18.594]  Is that what you understand?
[01:35:18.674 --> 01:35:19.815]  Well, we'd have to look.
[01:35:19.895 --> 01:35:24.581]  Every case is different, but this is generally how it's gone, both in Indiana and here in Texas.
[01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:27.625]  They were privatized and actually owned by a Spanish bank.
[01:35:29.568 --> 01:35:30.509]  All by a foreign country.
[01:35:30.549 --> 01:35:31.729]  You have a problem with that, Linda?
[01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.689]  Big time.
[01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:33.590]  Well, we want to make sure.
[01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:41.593]  See, here's what's going to happen, because I went to all the meetings down here, and I've written a lot about the Trans-Texas Corridor down here, which is part of the NAFTA Highway.
[01:35:42.233 --> 01:35:47.195]  And here's what you're going to have to watch out for, because they're going to tell you things you want to hear.
[01:35:47.475 --> 01:35:50.556]  How much money this is going to bring to the community, okay?
[01:35:50.856 --> 01:35:55.258]  How the roads are going to pay for themselves and be paid for in a matter of years, okay?
[01:35:56.218 --> 01:36:00.761]  You know, how traffic is going to be alleviated and how easy it is going to be for you.
[01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:13.848]  But what you're going to hear are things like transponders, RFID transponders, which will easily get you right through these toll lanes without having to stop and fish for your dollar bills, your Federal Reserve notes.
[01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:14.869]  You're going to hear about that.
[01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.509]  We're good to go.
[01:36:15.529 --> 01:36:15.709]  I think?
[01:36:37.885 --> 01:36:38.546]  We're good to go.
[01:36:54.624 --> 01:36:58.665]  And people just recently arrested up in Boston for the Big Dig for doing the same thing.
[01:36:58.705 --> 01:37:11.028]  These are the people that make the aggregate, that make the concrete, and this is how they get in under budget and ahead of schedule is they cheat the taxpayers, they build a piece of poop, okay, and charge you for it three, four times.
[01:37:11.108 --> 01:37:12.909]  It's double, triple taxing.
[01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:15.769]  But I got to tell you, Linda, just sit and take notes.
[01:37:15.849 --> 01:37:16.990]  Don't trust anyone.
[01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:22.451]  And if they get a chance to speak, you can tell them what a nightmare all of these roads have been all over the country.
[01:37:23.574 --> 01:37:27.979]  Tell me briefly about the NAFTA Highway and who it's owned by.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:31.603]  Well, the NAFTA Highway is being built in sections.
[01:37:31.943 --> 01:37:35.767]  So depending on what state you live in and what territory you live in,
[01:37:36.512 --> 01:37:40.293]  It would depend on who would own the bank, who would own the road.
[01:37:40.473 --> 01:37:45.394]  Here's another problem, of course, is where are they going to get the land to expand this freeway?
[01:37:45.434 --> 01:37:46.935]  This is a question you need to ask.
[01:37:47.635 --> 01:37:55.017]  Are they going to use eminent domain to take people's land in order to build this wonderful new expanded freeway in Maryland?
[01:37:55.894 --> 01:38:00.157]  So that's something that they've done here, and of course a lot of good people have fought that.
[01:38:00.477 --> 01:38:12.807]  Basically, the NAFTA corridor, which is going to go right through every state, right up to Minnesota, is a different story than the one you're talking about.
[01:38:12.847 --> 01:38:18.491]  But what you're talking about is what they did in New Jersey, what they're doing up and down the Eastern Corridor,
[01:38:19.071 --> 01:38:22.194]  And yeah, we want to alleviate traffic, don't we?
[01:38:22.234 --> 01:38:27.538]  We all want to have an easier ride to work, but how much are we willing to pay to do it?
[01:38:27.859 --> 01:38:30.741]  Up here, I believe they figured it out.
[01:38:30.761 --> 01:38:38.888]  It was something like 40 cents a mile is what it would cost you on top of the exorbitant gasoline that you have to pay for to put in your car.
[01:38:39.208 --> 01:38:42.251]  But the first thing I would get on them is where are you going to get the property?
[01:38:42.311 --> 01:38:45.093]  Are you going to use eminent domain in order to...
[01:38:46.034 --> 01:38:48.535]  To get this property to build this road.
[01:38:48.976 --> 01:38:51.237]  Prove to me that this is going to pay for itself.
[01:38:51.317 --> 01:38:54.458]  And I want to know who's going to own this when it's all said and done.
[01:38:54.498 --> 01:39:02.382]  Is this going to be owned by the people of Maryland, by the taxpayers, or is this going to be owned by the bank in Spain or what have you?
[01:39:02.742 --> 01:39:12.368]  So, I mean, there are a lot of questions you can ask, but the first thing you want to do if this is the first meeting is just go there, take notes, and ask the number one question, where is the land coming from?
[01:39:12.388 --> 01:39:14.550]  And I think that you can get started with that.
[01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:19.533]  And certainly if you have any questions, you're more than welcome to get back to us and ask us any specific questions.
[01:39:19.593 --> 01:39:21.274]  But it's a nightmare.
[01:39:21.474 --> 01:39:22.135]  It really is.
[01:39:22.215 --> 01:39:28.439]  And here we have had a heck of a time trying to stop it, and we have in a few communities, but it just goes on.
[01:39:28.479 --> 01:39:30.460]  No matter what we do, it just seems to go on.
[01:39:31.013 --> 01:39:34.616]  Now, is the NAFTA Highway part of this superhighway going from Mexico to Canada?
[01:39:34.656 --> 01:39:35.757]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:39:35.777 --> 01:39:37.119]  They call it the NAFTA Highway.
[01:39:37.179 --> 01:39:47.068]  And actually, if you go to InfoWars.com, do a little Google, you'll find a ton of information about it, more than I could probably get into the show, especially since we did about two hours on it yesterday.
[01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:48.269]  Okay, wonderful.
[01:39:48.289 --> 01:39:49.150]  You've been very helpful.
[01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:49.931]  Thank you, Linda.
[01:39:49.971 --> 01:39:51.912]  Good luck, and go take it to them, okay?
[01:39:51.972 --> 01:39:54.034]  Patrick in Kentucky is with us.
[01:39:54.114 --> 01:39:55.596]  Patrick, thank you for calling in.
[01:39:55.636 --> 01:39:56.777]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:57.381 --> 01:39:58.262]  Hungry, anybody?
[01:39:58.322 --> 01:40:03.505]  Go down to Wendy's and get you a nice little sandwich and wipe your mouth off with a petroleum-based napkin.
[01:40:04.825 --> 01:40:07.187]  You know, they're just killing me with the water down here.
[01:40:07.487 --> 01:40:09.148]  Pouring tons of chemicals in here.
[01:40:09.488 --> 01:40:09.968]  Killing me.
[01:40:10.829 --> 01:40:16.272]  But, you know, I've got this little paperweight with these four little monkeys somebody gave me a long time ago.
[01:40:16.292 --> 01:40:19.334]  This kind of tells you where we're at today.
[01:40:19.354 --> 01:40:26.538]  It's got this one monkey that says, sense no evil, you know, with their little motions with their hands.
[01:40:27.065 --> 01:40:29.587]  And the other one's holding his hands over his eyes.
[01:40:30.007 --> 01:40:33.650]  See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
[01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:36.552]  You know, isn't that kind of where we are today?
[01:40:37.793 --> 01:40:38.474]  Well, I don't know.
[01:40:38.494 --> 01:40:39.795]  I think we've always been there.
[01:40:39.835 --> 01:40:52.484]  I mean, the problem we have with today is there's been some serious social engineering done by roundtable groups, groups like the Tavistock Institute, groups like UNESCO, which was really articulated.
[01:40:52.524 --> 01:40:55.947]  In fact, Julian Huxley was the first head of UNESCO's
[01:40:56.147 --> 01:40:59.090]  I'm not trying to sound like Al Gore's inconvenient truth or anything, but...
[01:41:16.311 --> 01:41:22.293]  You know... Let me just finish, because you asked how things are so bad and where we're at today.
[01:41:22.333 --> 01:41:38.299]  Well, look, I mean, we used to be able to understand that what we did to our neighbor would come back to us, and we tried to all be good citizens of the world, good custodians of the world, if you like, and that has been beat out of us, and we've been dumbed down, according and again thanks to the United Nations.
[01:41:38.339 --> 01:41:40.620]  George Bush has signed on to UNESCO.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.061]  Even Clinton wouldn't sign on to UNESCO.
[01:41:43.081 --> 01:41:43.421]  Go ahead.
[01:41:43.821 --> 01:41:44.021]  Right.
[01:41:44.921 --> 01:42:06.703]  And, you know, some of the, like we got the former lieutenant governor, Steve Henry, who was in the neocon democratic administration in the 90s under Patton, and he's going around, and I'm sure there's others going around the other day talking about adding a constitutional amendment for anti-flag burning.
[01:42:07.424 --> 01:42:07.584]  Yeah.
[01:42:07.604 --> 01:42:07.684]  Yeah.
[01:42:37.771 --> 01:42:43.612]  He bombed the Chinese embassy in Kuwait and tried to get us in a war with them.
[01:42:44.272 --> 01:42:46.432]  And this is the same kind of crap that we get.
[01:42:46.452 --> 01:42:56.494]  And people just are still trapped in this false ideological left-right, you know, Republican- That's probably our biggest problem.
[01:42:56.854 --> 01:42:57.074]  Right?
[01:42:57.274 --> 01:43:06.736]  Patrick, it's probably our biggest problem because even if we manage to, and I don't even like the term waking people up because waking up means that you fall out of that control paradigm and
[01:43:07.276 --> 01:43:10.838]  And you start looking out for yourself and your neighbors in an independent fashion.
[01:43:10.878 --> 01:43:23.384]  But even if we get through to people that 9-11 is an inside job or that robot soldiers are bad or microchips are bad, they still are locked into somehow Hillary Clinton might come save me.
[01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:25.144]  Anybody but Bush.
[01:43:25.204 --> 01:43:28.566]  I mean, this was the mentality we saw leading up to the 2004 election.
[01:43:28.866 --> 01:43:31.948]  But Jack, doesn't this sound like another rerun of, you know,
[01:43:57.084 --> 01:44:06.729]  Darien Bush Sr., I mean, when they're going around talking about adding a constitutional amendment to anti-flag burning and all this, doesn't it sound like, here we go again?
[01:44:06.989 --> 01:44:12.511]  It's a rallying cry to get to their dumbed-down base, gay marriage and flag burning.
[01:44:12.551 --> 01:44:22.536]  But more than that, getting into a constitutional convention will open up a whole can of worms because they're not just going to debate flag burning or gay marriage.
[01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:23.136]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:23.356]  Absolutely.
[01:44:23.376 --> 01:44:24.516]  It's a living document.
[01:44:48.985 --> 01:44:52.687]  You know, that means that it can constantly be reinterpreted.
[01:44:52.707 --> 01:44:54.888]  You know what I think is going to happen?
[01:44:54.948 --> 01:45:01.472]  I think more and more people are discovering more about Hillary, and I think more people are going to go toward Gore.
[01:45:02.693 --> 01:45:07.135]  Well, Gore's not going to run, but I'll tell you what, I predicted... I thought he was.
[01:45:07.155 --> 01:45:09.436]  I don't even know if I should say this.
[01:45:09.557 --> 01:45:13.899]  I have predicted who will get the nominations for both parties and who will be president.
[01:45:14.445 --> 01:45:14.545]  Yeah.
[01:45:14.585 --> 01:45:14.685]  Yeah.
[01:45:14.705 --> 01:45:14.785]  Yeah.
[01:45:44.066 --> 01:45:45.068]  And boom, there you go.
[01:45:45.108 --> 01:45:46.209]  But we've got Edwards.
[01:45:46.249 --> 01:45:47.991]  He's approved by the Bilderberg Group.
[01:45:48.211 --> 01:45:51.696]  He's the only one to come out and admit that he made a mistake.
[01:45:51.936 --> 01:45:52.897]  Not a flip-flopper.
[01:45:53.258 --> 01:45:57.543]  I messed up and voted for the war and gave George W. Bush the authorization for the war.
[01:45:57.923 --> 01:46:00.767]  And he's the only one of the Democrats to really come out and say that
[01:46:01.027 --> 01:46:04.710]  I've got a big problem with what John Stadmiller on RBN is talking about.
[01:46:25.819 --> 01:46:27.120]  We don't need a third party.
[01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:30.441]  It needs to be done in the Republican or Democratic Party.
[01:46:30.501 --> 01:46:31.381]  We've done that before.
[01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:33.022]  It's time for a third party.
[01:46:34.002 --> 01:46:38.784]  Well, you better watch out because the third parties are largely infiltrated and controlled.
[01:46:38.844 --> 01:46:41.125]  So, look, what you've got to do is forget the parties.
[01:46:41.245 --> 01:46:44.767]  Anyone who says, and I'm not refuting the man you mentioned.
[01:46:44.827 --> 01:46:45.847]  It's not about that.
[01:46:46.047 --> 01:46:49.248]  But anyone who says it's about a party, don't listen to them.
[01:46:49.509 --> 01:46:54.010]  It's about candidates, whether they're Democrats, Republicans, or Independents.
[01:46:54.130 --> 01:46:54.531]  Period.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:58.621]  I understand that, but you need to understand.
[01:46:58.681 --> 01:47:00.101]  Everyone out there needs to understand.
[01:47:00.361 --> 01:47:01.802]  Don't get sucked into a party.
[01:47:01.842 --> 01:47:03.342]  Don't contribute to a party.
[01:47:03.602 --> 01:47:06.323]  Don't donate your time and resources to parties.
[01:47:06.663 --> 01:47:12.725]  Donate your time, resources, and support to candidates that you have fully vetted, and then we'll start seeing a change.
[01:47:12.765 --> 01:47:13.465]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:13.505 --> 01:47:14.066]  Appreciate it.
[01:47:14.346 --> 01:47:15.686]  Let's go to Chad in Iowa.
[01:47:15.706 --> 01:47:16.366]  I think we have time.
[01:47:16.386 --> 01:47:17.447]  Chad, thank you for calling in.
[01:47:17.467 --> 01:47:18.567]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.987 --> 01:47:19.147]  Hi.
[01:47:19.187 --> 01:47:20.428]  Sorry for yelling at everybody.
[01:47:22.249 --> 01:47:26.610]  So far, the summer of terror or fear or whatever kicked off pretty good.
[01:47:27.231 --> 01:47:30.231]  I'm not sure if I'm more scared or just furiously angry.
[01:47:30.251 --> 01:47:30.792]  That's right.
[01:47:30.932 --> 01:47:31.812]  Because you can see through it.
[01:47:31.992 --> 01:47:33.292]  I woke up one of my friends.
[01:47:33.372 --> 01:47:34.853]  He thought I was completely insane.
[01:47:34.973 --> 01:47:39.854]  And then he called back because there was a giant pentagram that the jet sprayed in the sky a couple weeks ago.
[01:47:39.874 --> 01:47:42.255]  You get a picture of that.
[01:47:43.483 --> 01:47:44.063]  Um, no.
[01:47:44.363 --> 01:47:49.544]  All I have is just a regular... Nobody's going to believe that unless you get a picture of it, of course.
[01:47:49.724 --> 01:47:50.024]  I know.
[01:47:50.284 --> 01:47:51.925]  And that is absolutely amazing.
[01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:56.546]  But then again, we've got military installations in the shape of swastikas.
[01:47:56.586 --> 01:47:58.926]  So I guess I'll believe anything.
[01:47:59.186 --> 01:48:00.827]  But you've got to get pictures of stuff like that.
[01:48:00.847 --> 01:48:05.127]  It was Sunday and Tuesday, and I am going out with my digital camera so I can put these online.
[01:48:05.648 --> 01:48:12.749]  Sunday and Tuesday, my friend was driving home from work at 1.30, 1.45 in the morning, and he saw three yellow garbage trucks
[01:48:13.444 --> 01:48:15.305]  But they had biohazard stickers on them.
[01:48:16.066 --> 01:48:19.288]  They were spraying this thick fog on the highway, so thick you couldn't see.
[01:48:19.768 --> 01:48:26.332]  Today I took it upon myself to call the Department of Health and Human Services, ASMAT, DOT, other places.
[01:48:26.892 --> 01:48:28.393]  Nobody knew what I was talking about.
[01:48:28.413 --> 01:48:35.898]  I asked them about mosquito control and this and that, and they said, we have these little brick-type things that we put near standing water and creeks.
[01:48:36.338 --> 01:48:37.439]  I've been calling my...
[01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:41.346]  It's highly documented that our government experiments on their people with chemical warfare.
[01:48:41.386 --> 01:48:43.026]  In fact, there have been several books written about it.
[01:48:43.046 --> 01:48:45.307]  I can't remember the name of the one I want to recommend right now.
[01:48:45.347 --> 01:48:47.608]  Either they were spraying insecticide or some type of herbicide or...
[01:49:03.326 --> 01:49:07.230]  Or whatever, which isn't good for anybody either, or it was something more nefarious.
[01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:09.212]  But again, you've got to do the homework on that.
[01:49:09.412 --> 01:49:11.334]  Yeah, I called and asked everybody in the area.
[01:49:11.354 --> 01:49:17.279]  Like I said, Department of Health and Human Services, the DOT, Hazmat, a couple other places.
[01:49:17.379 --> 01:49:18.801]  Nobody's ever heard of these before.
[01:49:19.441 --> 01:49:22.003]  Yellow garbage trucks with biohazard stickers on them.
[01:49:22.043 --> 01:49:24.664]  They're spraying just this horribly thick fog you can't see.
[01:49:24.724 --> 01:49:29.107]  Well, look, when you see that next time, what you're going to have to do is take a license plate.
[01:49:29.127 --> 01:49:35.050]  You're going to have to get more information on the truck so you can track it down and start asking questions of the right people.
[01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:36.391]  But you're on the right track.
[01:49:36.431 --> 01:49:39.073]  You're noticing the right things, and you're making the phone calls.
[01:49:39.133 --> 01:49:42.795]  And if you keep doing that, you're going to unturn some serious information.
[01:49:43.115 --> 01:49:44.156]  Folks, we'll come right back.
[01:49:44.256 --> 01:49:46.357]  More of your calls, more news and information.
[01:49:46.637 --> 01:49:49.879]  Why is Walmart getting secret shipments?
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:51.440]  Maybe we'll find out about that, too.
[01:49:51.681 --> 01:49:52.101]  Stay tuned.
[01:49:53.986 --> 01:49:55.467]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.647 --> 01:49:58.748]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.868 --> 01:50:02.769]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.829 --> 01:50:07.050]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:11.172]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.252 --> 01:50:13.152]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.292 --> 01:50:16.634]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.674 --> 01:50:17.734]  The medical bills.
[01:50:19.354 --> 01:50:21.395]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.535 --> 01:50:24.576]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.756 --> 01:50:27.657]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.098 --> 01:50:34.220]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:35.461]  We're good to go.
[01:50:35.481 --> 01:50:35.961]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.507 --> 01:50:59.730]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:06.034]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.334 --> 01:51:14.758]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.998 --> 01:51:22.022]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:27.145]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.365 --> 01:51:32.769]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:36.191]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:36.532 --> 01:51:44.457]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:58.819 --> 01:53:00.740]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:01.201 --> 01:53:03.962]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:18.274 --> 01:54:20.975]  TCB, folks.
[01:54:22.476 --> 01:54:23.396]  Phone lines are open.
[01:54:23.416 --> 01:54:25.037]  We're going to take calls for the rest of the show.
[01:54:25.217 --> 01:54:29.678]  Our guest got his time schedule messed up, so that means you get to get on the show today.
[01:54:29.698 --> 01:54:31.059]  We've got a lot of time to take calls.
[01:54:31.079 --> 01:54:32.019]  That's always good news.
[01:54:32.039 --> 01:54:32.759]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:32.779 --> 01:54:32.839]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:32.859 --> 01:54:34.800]  I got a story about Walmart that's very strange, and...
[01:54:43.652 --> 01:54:45.874]  Kind of goes with a lot of the things we're talking about today.
[01:54:45.914 --> 01:54:46.955]  I want to get out to you.
[01:54:46.975 --> 01:54:49.036]  I want to just reiterate my point.
[01:54:49.116 --> 01:54:50.317]  Don't fall for it.
[01:54:50.417 --> 01:54:51.778]  Parties are infiltrated.
[01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:53.139]  They have agendas.
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:54.541]  Go for candidates.
[01:54:54.781 --> 01:55:05.389]  We have candidates we support that are in the Green Party, believe it or not, in the Libertarian Party, in the Constitution Party, even in the Democrat and Republican parties.
[01:55:05.469 --> 01:55:06.430]  Candidates, though.
[01:55:07.324 --> 01:55:07.964]  We're good to go.
[01:55:37.649 --> 01:55:47.801]  I want to just quickly again thank the sponsors of this program and thank Alex Jones for letting me sit in and make sure that you all know about Prison Planet TV.
[01:55:47.861 --> 01:55:51.565]  Prison Planet TV has so much information in one place.
[01:55:51.625 --> 01:55:52.747]  I just think it's unprecedented.
[01:55:52.767 --> 01:55:55.610]  There's probably nothing like it on the planet Earth.
[01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:57.112]  Everything you hear on this show.
[01:55:57.532 --> 01:55:59.273]  Alex Jones' TV show.
[01:55:59.653 --> 01:56:01.513]  All of the special information.
[01:56:01.633 --> 01:56:04.434]  First view of the films that Alex produces.
[01:56:04.534 --> 01:56:05.755]  Terror Storm coming out.
[01:56:05.935 --> 01:56:08.095]  You'll be able to see it first on Prison Planet TV.
[01:56:08.415 --> 01:56:09.876]  The convention coverage.
[01:56:09.916 --> 01:56:13.577]  The coverage from this 9-11 conference here over the weekend.
[01:56:13.677 --> 01:56:16.338]  First time you'll be able to see it is on Prison Planet TV.
[01:56:16.698 --> 01:56:19.539]  People often ask me about weather modification.
[01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:20.399]  Ben Livingston.
[01:56:20.419 --> 01:56:21.780]  The interview for Ben Livingston.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.820]  Weaponized weather.
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.543]  A sample clip of that is on Prison Planet TV.
[01:56:26.603 --> 01:56:28.064]  The interview with Dean Haglund.
[01:56:28.644 --> 01:56:31.366]  All of Alex Jones' selective works and appearances.
[01:56:31.486 --> 01:56:32.727]  Alex Jones in London.
[01:56:33.708 --> 01:56:34.588]  Loose Change.
[01:56:34.668 --> 01:56:36.650]  I mean, so much on Prison Planet TV.
[01:56:36.670 --> 01:56:38.431]  Of course, all of Alex's videos.
[01:56:38.852 --> 01:56:40.733]  It is just an amazing resource.
[01:56:40.773 --> 01:56:41.954]  The whole year is only $54.
[01:56:42.034 --> 01:56:42.354]  There's
[01:56:43.775 --> 01:56:44.496]  We're good to go.
[01:57:05.315 --> 01:57:05.495]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:05.515 --> 01:57:06.096]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:07.797 --> 01:57:09.999]  You support InfoWars.
[01:57:10.199 --> 01:57:11.000]  You go to the store.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:19.586]  You not only support the authors, but you support this endeavor by Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, and you support liberty and freedom.
[01:57:19.646 --> 01:57:20.767]  That's what you want to do, folks.
[01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:24.510]  All films authorized to make copies for educational purposes only.
[01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:27.533]  We'll come right back, top of the hour, take more of your calls, give you more news.
[01:57:27.773 --> 01:57:31.416]  This is the Alex Jones Show, GCN, Radio Network, InfoWars.com.
[01:57:33.775 --> 01:57:34.376]  We're good to go.
[01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:01.079]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[01:58:29.281 --> 01:58:35.546]  I believe Alex will be back with you on Monday giving you full reports from the convention.
[01:58:35.566 --> 01:58:36.667]  I call it a convention.
[01:58:36.747 --> 01:58:37.748]  It is a conference.
[01:58:37.788 --> 01:58:39.289]  A conference of scholars.
[01:58:39.349 --> 01:58:47.095]  A conference of highly placed individuals who are now all questioning what happened on 9-11.
[01:58:47.376 --> 01:58:52.039]  I think we're about done questioning because we have so many answers.
[01:58:52.339 --> 01:58:54.181]  Professor Stephen Jones will be appearing.
[01:58:54.221 --> 01:58:56.503]  We were just told to announce that Charlie Sheen...
[01:58:57.143 --> 01:59:04.669]  We'll be appearing at the Saturday version of the event, so if you go, make sure you're there Saturday if you want to see Charlie Sheen.
[01:59:04.689 --> 01:59:13.637]  I think that will be rather motivating, and I just really can't applaud him more for coming out and speaking out against 9-11, risking everything to do that.
[01:59:13.897 --> 01:59:22.624]  But Alex will be back on Monday talking about all of that, and not long after that, as we mentioned earlier on prisonplanet.tv, you'll begin to start seeing some of the video footage.
[01:59:22.664 --> 01:59:25.947]  And we were told earlier, thanks to a lot of you good info warriors,
[01:59:26.207 --> 01:59:26.887]  We're good to go.
[01:59:26.907 --> 01:59:27.107]  I think?
[01:59:50.163 --> 01:59:55.229]  And this came to my email box today, and it reads like this.
[01:59:55.269 --> 02:00:02.637]  For the past few months, there have been numerous trucks delivering inventory at our local Walmart here in Missouri.
[02:00:03.057 --> 02:00:08.043]  I am an inventory manager, and the trucks are not carrying Walmart containers.
[02:00:08.795 --> 02:00:18.619]  We have been told not to process the pallets, which are military style, the same we used in the Gulf War where I was a reservist in logistics and supply.
[02:00:18.979 --> 02:00:20.580]  The warehouse is now full.
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:25.202]  A few have peaked at the contents at the risk of being caught.
[02:00:25.795 --> 02:00:31.520]  And ten cans, or number ten cans, of what appears to be bulk non-perishable foods.
[02:00:32.101 --> 02:00:38.687]  Management have been acting very strange, always in a hurry, and there are numerous top management meetings.
[02:00:38.927 --> 02:00:48.136]  I know for a fact that we have huge contracts with FEMA, and that is why there is a Walmart within 50 miles of any population center.
[02:00:48.911 --> 02:00:49.452]  We're good to go.
[02:01:12.473 --> 02:01:13.334]  COG.
[02:01:13.474 --> 02:01:14.654]  What is COG?
[02:01:15.154 --> 02:01:17.856]  It is Continuity of Government.
[02:01:17.896 --> 02:01:20.857]  Continuity of Operations and Continuity of Government.
[02:01:20.877 --> 02:01:34.803]  This is a plan in part of a comprehensive emergency management program using comprehensive planning processes based on federal guidance and best practices in emergency management and continuity planning.
[02:01:36.404 --> 02:01:43.006]  The article here in front of me, it addresses what COOP and COG really is.
[02:01:43.066 --> 02:01:51.509]  And basically, what it refers to, and certainly this is some very shadow government stuff here, some very Orwellian stuff.
[02:01:51.929 --> 02:01:56.353]  But it was conceived during the Cold War as a way to ensure that the U.S.
[02:01:56.413 --> 02:01:59.815]  government would be able to continue in case of a nuclear war.
[02:01:59.856 --> 02:02:06.161]  In addition, continuity planning was a requirement for state and local governments under the Civil Defense Program mandate.
[02:02:06.461 --> 02:02:13.026]  Today, the continuity of operations and continuity of government planning remains an important planning requirement.
[02:02:13.066 --> 02:02:21.373]  While terrorism might be the threat that is leading to the increase of planning efforts, COOP and COG planning will help ensure governments that services...
[02:02:21.993 --> 02:02:23.874]  Are ready to go in the face of any hazards.
[02:02:23.934 --> 02:02:27.897]  In other words, the corporations will feed you in an emergency.
[02:02:28.297 --> 02:02:38.043]  Not your local churches, not your local community centers, but FEMA working through groups like Walmart will be able to take care of you in case of an emergency.
[02:02:38.244 --> 02:02:40.265]  We'll come back, take your calls, talk more about this.
[02:02:40.445 --> 02:02:41.546]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:41.586 --> 02:02:41.986]  Stay tuned.
[02:02:46.889 --> 02:02:49.771]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.539 --> 02:02:51.160]  We're good to go.
[02:03:05.339 --> 02:03:06.820]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:52.361]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:52.581 --> 02:03:58.785]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:04:53.965 --> 02:05:02.487]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival and financial freedom to history, politics, conspiracy and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:05:02.627 --> 02:05:04.428]  You can order everything you need on the web at
[02:05:04.608 --> 02:05:05.209]  We're good to go.
[02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:20.585]  We're good to go.
[02:05:20.605 --> 02:05:21.025]  We're good to go.
[02:05:21.045 --> 02:05:21.426]  We're good to go.
[02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:51.114]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:51.454 --> 02:05:53.776]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.796 --> 02:05:56.238]  We were just discussing briefly continuity of government, TOG.
[02:05:56.258 --> 02:05:59.601]  Some of these boxes at Walmart marked R2, which is Region 2, east of the Mississippi.
[02:05:59.641 --> 02:06:01.342]  Region 1 would be west of the Mississippi.
[02:06:14.284 --> 02:06:24.269]  And again, getting into the concept of if there is a real emergency or even a false flag operation, do we need to go running to Walmart to be fed?
[02:06:24.469 --> 02:06:29.071]  Or isn't that the job of our local churches, our community centers?
[02:06:29.811 --> 02:06:37.054]  Aren't they supposed to be stocking up on food and water to take care of us so that we don't have to take a FEMA number in order to get fed?
[02:06:38.195 --> 02:06:40.156]  Obviously, that's the moral of the story.
[02:06:40.556 --> 02:06:42.997]  The most important point that we can point out here is that
[02:06:43.891 --> 02:06:44.831]  You need to be prepared.
[02:06:47.193 --> 02:06:48.213]  I hope you understand that.
[02:06:48.353 --> 02:06:49.754]  You need to be prepared.
[02:06:49.794 --> 02:06:53.956]  That means whenever you go to the supermarket, buy an extra can of food.
[02:06:54.016 --> 02:06:56.117]  Buy some extra dry food and store them.
[02:06:56.917 --> 02:06:57.818]  Get MREs.
[02:06:58.138 --> 02:07:01.980]  And whatever you do, make sure you have a way to purify water.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.841]  These things have to be done.
[02:07:05.101 --> 02:07:12.145]  Make sure you have firearms to protect those things because as we saw in New Orleans, a lot of
[02:07:13.238 --> 02:07:23.489]  Gangs tracked down the sound of generators and went in shooting and simply stole everything from the people there that were prepared.
[02:07:23.509 --> 02:07:28.174]  So you have to not only be prepared, but be prepared to protect what you have.
[02:07:29.916 --> 02:07:32.098]  And everything that implies.
[02:07:32.685 --> 02:07:35.967]  So the bottom line is here, don't expect someone else to save you.
[02:07:36.007 --> 02:07:38.409]  Don't expect someone else to get you through an emergency.
[02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:40.270]  You make sure you're prepared.
[02:07:40.330 --> 02:07:44.993]  Make sure your friends and your family and everybody else is prepared and you'll ride through an emergency.
[02:07:45.193 --> 02:07:46.394]  Have a place picked out.
[02:07:47.314 --> 02:07:50.897]  Maybe 20, 30 miles outside of the city or longer if you can.
[02:07:50.917 --> 02:07:53.778]  Have a place you can go if you have to to get out of the city.
[02:07:53.818 --> 02:07:55.740]  Have a plan to get out of the city.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:59.482]  Because they're going to lock you into these grids and you're going to be stuck.
[02:08:00.287 --> 02:08:01.948]  And we've seen this happen time and time again.
[02:08:01.968 --> 02:08:04.390]  I remember the blackouts just about two years ago.
[02:08:04.691 --> 02:08:09.514]  Massive rolling blackouts from New York to Ohio and then throughout Canada.
[02:08:10.235 --> 02:08:19.082]  And it didn't take more than a day before martial law was declared in Cleveland by the mayor of Cleveland and the people were standing at FEMA trucks trying to get food and water.
[02:08:19.462 --> 02:08:21.584]  In this case, at the Walmart.
[02:08:22.405 --> 02:08:23.305]  I've got to tell you something else.
[02:08:23.325 --> 02:08:25.247]  This is just a strange coincidence, I'm sure.
[02:08:26.028 --> 02:08:28.910]  I'm looking at... I printed this up today from my e-mail.
[02:08:29.839 --> 02:08:35.903]  And it says at the top, it gives my email information, my Hotmail account information, and then it ends, message 666.
[02:08:37.904 --> 02:08:42.187]  Just a coincidence, or is somebody trying to tell me something?
[02:08:42.207 --> 02:08:43.648]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:43.888 --> 02:08:45.750]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:47.231]  We're going to go back to the phone.
[02:08:47.291 --> 02:08:51.353]  Steve in Florida, where I'm sure you better be prepared, living in Florida.
[02:08:51.373 --> 02:08:52.394]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:52.834 --> 02:08:54.255]  Hi, Jack, and yes, you're right.
[02:08:54.335 --> 02:08:56.457]  Anybody living here would be a fool if they were not prepared.
[02:08:56.677 --> 02:08:56.817]  Yep.
[02:08:57.185 --> 02:09:00.167]  I had several points to start with, though I came in late.
[02:09:01.127 --> 02:09:08.871]  And you were speaking as I came in on firearms confiscation, Mr. Bolton and you, and would you give a quickie to me of what's going on, and then I'll get in my other points?
[02:09:09.631 --> 02:09:12.393]  Well, basically, there was an alert put out by the NRA.
[02:09:13.313 --> 02:09:15.394]  I believe this just came out today.
[02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:17.035]  It's entitled...
[02:09:17.935 --> 02:09:20.336]  Fire a shot heard around the world on July 4th.
[02:09:20.376 --> 02:09:36.860]  Basically what this is, is the United Nations is getting together with a number of countries around the world on July 4th at the United Nations headquarters in New York to debate how they can continue to register firearms, how they can continue to control firearms, and eventually take our firearms from us.
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.881]  So that was the pretext of our interview.
[02:09:39.181 --> 02:09:41.922]  Okay, good.
[02:09:41.962 --> 02:09:46.103]  You or some of the guests were talking about brainwashing and mind control, and we see this a lot.
[02:09:46.798 --> 02:09:47.999]  I see it in many areas.
[02:09:48.039 --> 02:09:52.080]  I've gotten all of Alex Jones' videos over the years and passed them out and made copies.
[02:09:52.821 --> 02:09:59.383]  The latest one I'm passing out over the past year or so is the Beyond Treason by Joyce Reiling and Dr. Roeke.
[02:09:59.704 --> 02:10:06.226]  I noticed a very large segment of the population down here, which is a military town.
[02:10:06.286 --> 02:10:06.827]  It's shocking.
[02:10:07.687 --> 02:10:14.110]  I take copies of Dr. Hallenstein's depleted uranium article and I lay them around the waiting room's
[02:10:15.191 --> 02:10:18.072]  In the Naval Hospital filled with retirees and active duty personnel.
[02:10:18.572 --> 02:10:25.075]  And they picked them up and glanced at them for a moment and then put them down in favor of the silly magazines that you usually see in these hospitals.
[02:10:26.155 --> 02:10:29.097]  Given many copies of Beyond Treason to individuals.
[02:10:29.337 --> 02:10:35.039]  So you're putting free copies of videos in the lobby of the VA hospitals and they won't even take the free copies?
[02:10:35.319 --> 02:10:37.520]  Not the VA hospital, although that's been done.
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:39.581]  The Naval base, the Naval Hospital.
[02:10:40.081 --> 02:10:42.482]  Retirees and active duty personnel dependents.
[02:10:43.052 --> 02:10:44.232]  They pick it up and put it down.
[02:10:44.272 --> 02:10:44.913]  They're not interested.
[02:10:44.953 --> 02:10:47.473]  It says right on the top, Depleted Uranium Gulf War Illness.
[02:10:47.513 --> 02:10:48.394]  I've got it all highlighted.
[02:10:48.714 --> 02:10:50.494]  It might not be that they're not interested.
[02:10:50.534 --> 02:10:54.976]  It might be that they're just not prepared to face the information as soon as they see that title.
[02:10:55.516 --> 02:10:58.837]  Because, again, that makes you responsible, doesn't it, once you know the information?
[02:10:59.097 --> 02:10:59.557]  You're correct.
[02:10:59.597 --> 02:11:06.119]  I've given many copies of Beyond Treason to individual personnel, including doctors.
[02:11:06.219 --> 02:11:08.100]  And very interestingly enough, they become frightened.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:09.520]  And a few get angry.
[02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:12.161]  And I've noticed that the people who become angry are enlisted.
[02:11:13.205 --> 02:11:17.308]  Very strange that the officers do not get angry.
[02:11:17.328 --> 02:11:19.609]  They seem to get frightened and don't want to talk about things.
[02:11:19.649 --> 02:11:20.069]  You know what?
[02:11:20.130 --> 02:11:23.291]  I'm going to tell you something, Steve, and this is something we've started to figure out.
[02:11:23.371 --> 02:11:30.976]  I've had some pretty heated arguments with so-called war veterans from the Gulf War and from the Iraq War.
[02:11:31.036 --> 02:11:31.837]  One of them.
[02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:33.097]  Okay, well, then they stay.
[02:11:33.458 --> 02:11:34.078]  You know how it is.
[02:11:34.398 --> 02:11:35.519]  Well, I went and fought there.
[02:11:35.559 --> 02:11:36.340]  You didn't fight there.
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:37.361]  What do you know about it?
[02:11:37.401 --> 02:11:41.664]  Well, I know because I interview all the generals and all your commanders.
[02:11:41.704 --> 02:11:42.525]  That's how I know.
[02:11:42.785 --> 02:11:50.091]  I interview guys like Doug Rocky, who, as you mentioned, Dr. Rocky wrote the Pentagon Platform for how to handle depleted uranium.
[02:11:50.291 --> 02:11:53.694]  When he went there to supervise that, he was poisoned himself by that.
[02:11:53.734 --> 02:11:54.655]  But my point is...
[02:11:55.015 --> 02:11:55.736]  We're good to go.
[02:11:55.756 --> 02:11:56.276]  We're good to go.
[02:12:12.005 --> 02:12:15.748]  It's very, very scary stuff, but certainly something we need to know about.
[02:12:15.768 --> 02:12:21.453]  And I've got to compliment you, Steve, for what you're doing, man, getting these videos out, putting them in places where people need to see them.
[02:12:21.473 --> 02:12:29.819]  We can't worry about if everyone's going to absorb the information or latch onto it even, but we have to do what we can to get that information to them.
[02:12:29.859 --> 02:12:35.444]  And one of those videos could end up being shown to thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.
[02:12:35.624 --> 02:12:36.485]  We can never forget that.
[02:12:37.165 --> 02:12:39.207]  I thank you for thanking me, but it's really not me.
[02:12:39.247 --> 02:12:40.548]  If Alex is not carrying it or...
[02:12:41.075 --> 02:12:43.376]  Joyce Riley, I couldn't have these things to pass out.
[02:12:43.396 --> 02:12:47.697]  I put copies in all of the libraries in Escambia County and center of the county.
[02:12:48.057 --> 02:12:49.778]  I put it on AXS TV over the college.
[02:12:49.818 --> 02:12:51.378]  It's on Channel 4 every last Saturday.
[02:12:52.158 --> 02:12:53.239]  I've given them all over the place.
[02:12:53.439 --> 02:12:54.959]  If there's copies in my hand, I'm going to pass them out.
[02:12:54.979 --> 02:12:55.800]  You're the man, Steve.
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:13:06.743]  Well, this is a grassroots operation, and we don't hide behind the fact that we're activists first and talk radio hosts second, something that Dan Rather and Sean Hannity never admit to.
[02:13:06.763 --> 02:13:07.263]  But you know what?
[02:13:07.523 --> 02:13:08.844]  Dr. Roth, you listen to the show.
[02:13:08.864 --> 02:13:09.564]  You got a message for him?
[02:13:11.793 --> 02:13:13.834]  I pray for him in his house with my family.
[02:13:13.894 --> 02:13:14.374]  We love him.
[02:13:14.414 --> 02:13:15.595]  I'm glad he did the work.
[02:13:16.055 --> 02:13:16.916]  I'm a Gulf War veteran.
[02:13:16.936 --> 02:13:18.317]  I'm a Vietnam veteran, as he is.
[02:13:19.237 --> 02:13:23.760]  And I will continue to pass these out because I have Gulf War illness.
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:27.362]  I have friends that are on morphine and OxyContin all day long.
[02:13:28.083 --> 02:13:34.287]  Many of the people that serve with me with a SEAL team I was with and the Force Recon Marines in the 91 War have died in the past 15 years.
[02:13:34.307 --> 02:13:36.228]  I am not upset at...
[02:13:37.156 --> 02:13:40.958]  Anyone in the government, I am trying to wake people up as to what is happening to our veterans.
[02:13:40.978 --> 02:13:42.258]  There's half a million of us sick.
[02:13:42.479 --> 02:13:44.339]  Well, we're supposed to support our troops.
[02:13:44.379 --> 02:13:45.860]  This is one way to do it, isn't it, Steve?
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:49.982]  I do support them by telling people the truth of what's happening with the troops that are coming back right now.
[02:13:50.042 --> 02:13:51.023]  That's exactly right.
[02:13:51.663 --> 02:13:53.184]  Hey, good for you, Steve, man.
[02:13:53.224 --> 02:13:54.104]  Keep up the good work.
[02:13:54.184 --> 02:13:55.205]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:13:55.345 --> 02:13:56.145]  And one last thing.
[02:13:56.185 --> 02:13:56.425]  Sure.
[02:13:56.685 --> 02:14:01.948]  I want to tell people to watch not only all of Alex Jones' videos, but Lose Change.
[02:14:02.648 --> 02:14:04.109]  It's phenomenal and powerful.
[02:14:04.898 --> 02:14:07.059]  We carry all that right here at InfoWars.
[02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:19.544]  Thank you for recommending that, and there's even some new 9-11 videos and 9-11 information that's just starting to reach the public, which is boggling our minds, really starting to fill in all the last pieces of the puzzle.
[02:14:19.744 --> 02:14:28.468]  But, of course, when you make a puzzle, you can see what the picture's going to be, but, of course, there's always someone that's going to say, hey, there's a piece missing out of the sky in your puzzle.
[02:14:28.528 --> 02:14:29.368]  That's not right.
[02:14:29.708 --> 02:14:45.160]  So we're now even filling those pieces in, and the whole story is beginning to come together about insider trading, about global drug smuggling, global intelligence, and add on top of that the loss of liberties and all of these justifications and pretexts for war.
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:50.985]  We're starting to really get a serious understanding of what happened that day on 9-11.
[02:14:51.025 --> 02:14:52.626]  Steve, thanks again for the call.
[02:14:52.866 --> 02:14:53.807]  We've got Dave.
[02:14:53.847 --> 02:14:56.629]  Dave, I can't read my handwriting, but I think you're the only Dave.
[02:14:56.669 --> 02:14:57.770]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:58.638 --> 02:15:00.680]  Yeah, I'm actually calling from Utah.
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:01.200]  Okay.
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:06.324]  And I was in Washington recently, was speaking with a friend of mine who actually got back from Iraq.
[02:15:06.344 --> 02:15:23.556]  He was over there for 14 months, and even though he really doesn't want to talk about his experiences directly, since it's, I guess, pretty recent to him, the only thing he really will say and agree with is that, you know, America really doesn't have any place in being over there.
[02:15:24.577 --> 02:15:25.177]  And...
[02:15:26.685 --> 02:15:41.609]  In supporting the troops along that vein, as you were just speaking with Steve, it's hard for me to validate sending our troops to foreign countries to fight wars like this.
[02:15:42.628 --> 02:15:56.523]  Well, George Bush said when he was running for the presidency back in 2000, if we don't stop sending our troops around the world in these nation-building projects, we're going to see serious trouble coming down the road.
[02:15:56.543 --> 02:15:57.784]  And what is the first thing he did?
[02:16:00.131 --> 02:16:02.772]  Even George W. Bush knows this.
[02:16:02.812 --> 02:16:04.573]  They even knew this ahead of time.
[02:16:04.853 --> 02:16:09.215]  And for them to say, well, we really did think they were going to throw flowers at our feet.
[02:16:09.255 --> 02:16:20.341]  We really did think we were going over there to help the Iraqi people get freedom and democracy while we're grabbing their guns, putting together curfews, and torturing them and killing innocent women and children.
[02:16:20.361 --> 02:16:26.825]  They can say they really believe that all they want, but that doesn't change the fact that that's where we're at.
[02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:35.206]  Yeah, I'm only 25 years old, so this is like the first major conflict that I've really been alive for.
[02:16:35.226 --> 02:16:48.359]  I remember the first Gulf War, my mom turning on the TV when we were sending troops in there the first time, and I remember that made an impression on me.
[02:16:48.419 --> 02:16:51.922]  I was only probably about 11 or 12 at the time, and it just...
[02:16:53.635 --> 02:16:58.836]  It struck me as wrong then, and there I was young, you know, kind of realizing that.
[02:16:59.516 --> 02:17:00.456]  Well, look, it's wrong.
[02:17:00.477 --> 02:17:05.798]  I don't know if everyone agrees with this, but a majority of people believe now this was a big mistake.
[02:17:05.838 --> 02:17:09.278]  The problem people have is, what do we do about it?
[02:17:09.698 --> 02:17:13.899]  Okay, as Colin Powell said, you broke the dishes, you know, you got to clean up the store.
[02:17:13.979 --> 02:17:16.140]  But, look, this is the thing.
[02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:18.060]  People need to really understand this.
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:22.203]  We pulled out of Vietnam under the same criticism and the same circumstances.
[02:17:22.263 --> 02:17:27.487]  If we pull out, the domino theory is going to roll through Southeast Asia and the communists are going to take over the world.
[02:17:27.747 --> 02:17:28.908]  What happened when we pulled out?
[02:17:29.268 --> 02:17:29.868]  Nothing!
[02:17:30.289 --> 02:17:31.630]  Nothing bad happened.
[02:17:31.650 --> 02:17:32.530]  We saved face.
[02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:33.731]  Everything was good to go.
[02:17:34.452 --> 02:17:35.212]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:35.572 --> 02:17:36.933]  I'll hold you over, Dave, if you like.
[02:17:36.953 --> 02:17:39.695]  We're going to go to Dan and Gene and Greg, everybody patiently holding.

[02:19:14.119 --> 02:19:14.780]  We're good to go.
[02:19:46.832 --> 02:19:50.314]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:19:50.574 --> 02:19:54.075]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:54.175 --> 02:19:58.117]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:19:58.337 --> 02:20:04.500]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:12.804]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:20:13.224 --> 02:20:18.569]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:18.729 --> 02:20:22.492]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:22.853 --> 02:20:24.714]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:20:24.774 --> 02:20:26.936]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:20:27.196 --> 02:20:32.121]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:20:32.321 --> 02:20:37.725]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:40.868 --> 02:20:42.410]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:20:46.369 --> 02:20:46.649]  We're good.
[02:21:16.722 --> 02:21:20.483]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:21:20.723 --> 02:21:25.505]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:21:25.525 --> 02:21:27.286]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:21:27.566 --> 02:21:27.766]  No.
[02:21:28.106 --> 02:21:31.867]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:21:32.267 --> 02:21:33.628]  Are all covers the same?
[02:21:33.868 --> 02:21:34.108]  No.
[02:21:34.388 --> 02:21:38.069]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:21:38.450 --> 02:21:40.590]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:43.391]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabric's got you covered.
[02:21:43.671 --> 02:21:45.432]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:21:46.056 --> 02:21:59.204]  For over 50 years, the Cow Bench Soap Company has been showing customers around the world that soap
[02:22:07.935 --> 02:22:08.756]  We're good to go.
[02:22:31.514 --> 02:22:33.215]  We need to get you Cal-Ben soap.
[02:22:33.255 --> 02:22:35.377]  This is naturally good for the environment.
[02:22:35.997 --> 02:22:37.218]  I talked about this yesterday.
[02:22:37.238 --> 02:22:44.283]  I had a lot of joint pain, and as soon as I switched to Cal-Ben soap, my joint pain went away, and I found out it was from the formaldehyde in the soap.
[02:22:44.343 --> 02:22:48.466]  I thought I was going to need pain pills or surgery.
[02:22:48.846 --> 02:22:52.769]  No, I didn't need medication or surgery or pharmaceuticals.
[02:22:53.089 --> 02:22:59.834]  The Cal-Ben soap did it for me, and it's funny how these little changes you can make in your life make such a big difference.
[02:23:00.194 --> 02:23:07.044]  Cal Bend Soap, one of the great sponsors of this show, the Alex Jones Show, they are waiting for your call right now to order.
[02:23:07.124 --> 02:23:10.269]  You can go to their website, calbendpuresoap.com.
[02:23:10.791 --> 02:23:20.954]  Calben, C-A-L-B-E-N, puresoap.com, or give them a call at 510-638-7091.
[02:23:21.734 --> 02:23:23.714]  Again, 510-638-7091.
[02:23:24.935 --> 02:23:32.337]  This has been endorsed by so many people, and now I'm somebody who can endorse Calben Soap as well.
[02:23:32.377 --> 02:23:37.598]  So get on the bandwagon here, and you might, again, be having some of the same problems I had, some health problems.
[02:23:38.078 --> 02:23:39.179]  And see those alleviated.
[02:23:39.239 --> 02:23:41.281]  Not only that, it's good for the environment as well.
[02:23:41.762 --> 02:23:50.270]  Not that we're raging environmentalists here, like Al Gore, but anything we can do to, again, help our environment is always going to be good.
[02:23:50.290 --> 02:23:51.712]  I want to go back to the phones.
[02:23:51.752 --> 02:23:52.633]  I'm catching my breath.
[02:23:52.673 --> 02:23:55.255]  I had to run across the street and get some coffee here real quick.
[02:23:55.355 --> 02:23:55.716]  I'll ask
[02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:58.161]  Break, but we're all good.
[02:23:58.201 --> 02:23:58.861]  We're good to go.
[02:23:58.881 --> 02:24:01.942]  Let me go back to the phones.
[02:24:01.962 --> 02:24:04.503]  800-259-9231, anything that you want to talk about.
[02:24:04.623 --> 02:24:08.184]  And we had Dave in Utah was holding over, so Dave, we'll go back to you, let you finish up.
[02:24:08.884 --> 02:24:09.905]  Okay, thanks.
[02:24:11.585 --> 02:24:15.867]  As far as the Walmart shipments, I do have some family that works at a distribution center.
[02:24:17.571 --> 02:24:17.951]  In St.
[02:24:17.991 --> 02:24:18.891]  George here in Utah.
[02:24:18.931 --> 02:24:21.213]  So I think I'll give them a call to see if they've seen anything about that.
[02:24:21.233 --> 02:24:28.077]  You know, the thing about that is, though, when I first read that story, I mean, you know, the natural inclination is to go, well, Walmart just wants to help.
[02:24:28.177 --> 02:24:34.281]  What's wrong with Walmart working with FEMA and the government just to help people in case of an emergency?
[02:24:34.621 --> 02:24:37.503]  And I think I detailed exactly what is wrong with that.
[02:24:38.023 --> 02:24:42.966]  It is suspect that Walmart would be having an involvement.
[02:24:43.146 --> 02:24:44.067]  That's for certain.
[02:24:45.128 --> 02:24:45.628]  But, I mean...
[02:24:46.575 --> 02:24:51.960]  The preparedness of the country and of the government to handle disasters has been...
[02:24:53.345 --> 02:24:57.828]  Pretty much called into question since Katrina, very severely.
[02:24:57.868 --> 02:24:58.468]  Absolutely.
[02:24:58.748 --> 02:25:04.231]  Yeah, all that water and all that food couldn't even get into Katrina because, again, it's your government that's coming to save you.
[02:25:04.652 --> 02:25:15.078]  If the government really wants to do something to help people be prepared, they need to put out all kinds of free brochures and massive commercials on the mainstream media telling you how to be prepared for yourself.
[02:25:15.358 --> 02:25:17.439]  And then, of course, if people don't heed that message...
[02:25:18.079 --> 02:25:24.523]  Giving back to the local churches and community centers where you can go and actually get help immediately in a local emergency.
[02:25:24.583 --> 02:25:27.825]  But we beat that to death pretty much.
[02:25:28.165 --> 02:25:43.253]  One question I did have about the NAFTA super corridor coming in from Texas is the governor's involvement there, doesn't that kind of seem like a silent succession from the union?
[02:25:45.078 --> 02:25:46.338]  I don't think it's that.
[02:25:46.378 --> 02:25:51.540]  I mean, our governor here in Texas, Rick Perry, is a creation of Karl Rove.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:57.081]  I mean, he was the replacement that was groomed to come in and take over after George W. Bush.
[02:25:57.141 --> 02:25:59.402]  And Karl Rove helped make that happen.
[02:25:59.702 --> 02:26:07.584]  And Perry has done nothing but embody tech stock and help tech stock and all of these corporations put this thing up.
[02:26:07.684 --> 02:26:09.325]  So, secession?
[02:26:09.405 --> 02:26:09.765]  I don't know.
[02:26:09.885 --> 02:26:11.005]  Privatization?
[02:26:11.065 --> 02:26:13.586]  The selling off of our land to foreign countries?
[02:26:13.926 --> 02:26:14.706]  Certainly, yes.
[02:26:14.766 --> 02:26:23.749]  And the problem with this, and what I was trying to get through to Linda earlier, is we went through all these city council meetings for over a year, maybe longer, almost two years.
[02:26:24.249 --> 02:26:31.672]  And we'd have city council members here, it was Brewster McCracken and others, who would say, we're going to investigate this, and we're looking out for you.
[02:26:31.912 --> 02:26:39.954]  And what we'd find out is all they were doing was buying time for the corporations, because as soon as they got enough of this put up, there was just going to be no going back.
[02:26:41.755 --> 02:26:42.275]  Understood.
[02:26:43.258 --> 02:26:48.461]  In regard to the conference this weekend, I would love to attend.
[02:26:48.601 --> 02:26:49.542]  Unfortunately, I can't.
[02:26:49.582 --> 02:26:52.723]  So I'm hoping to catch as much of it on C-SPAN as possible.
[02:26:53.244 --> 02:26:56.505]  And it's encouraging to hear that they are definitely...
[02:26:58.553 --> 02:27:01.894]  Well, look, let me interrupt you, and I've got to move on here, too.
[02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:03.495]  Here's the thing.
[02:27:03.535 --> 02:27:05.255]  You'll be able to see all the speeches.
[02:27:05.315 --> 02:27:08.876]  You know Alex Jones is going to film all of this and make all this available to you.
[02:27:09.116 --> 02:27:19.699]  The reason why you want to go to these conferences is to meet like-minded people from all over the world who believe what you believe and to have that sense of positiveness and community spirit.
[02:27:20.139 --> 02:27:21.880]  That's the real reason you want to go to these folks.
[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:22.940]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:24.241]  Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:24.321 --> 02:27:25.882]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:27:25.982 --> 02:27:29.544]  Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.com, GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:36.589 --> 02:27:37.469]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.969 --> 02:27:39.570]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.491 --> 02:27:43.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.588 --> 02:27:50.991]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[02:27:51.171 --> 02:27:56.855]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[02:27:57.215 --> 02:28:02.139]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[02:28:02.379 --> 02:28:06.882]  It contains xanthomes, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[02:28:07.182 --> 02:28:07.803]  We're good to go.
[02:28:07.823 --> 02:28:07.983]  I think?
[02:28:28.286 --> 02:28:29.907]  Unleash the power of Zango today.
[02:28:30.147 --> 02:28:31.467]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[02:28:31.487 --> 02:28:32.348]  That's 888-203-6633.
[02:28:32.448 --> 02:28:34.148]  Or visit www.mangosteenmarket.com.
[02:28:34.289 --> 02:28:35.609]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[02:28:46.132 --> 02:28:53.641]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.921 --> 02:29:04.834]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.094 --> 02:29:06.895]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:29:07.175 --> 02:29:10.498]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.818 --> 02:29:21.285]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:22.065]  That's right.
[02:29:22.245 --> 02:29:29.367]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.667 --> 02:29:38.410]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:38.910]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:47.890 --> 02:29:50.451]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:50.611 --> 02:29:52.772]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:53.053 --> 02:30:03.158]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:30:03.478 --> 02:30:05.779]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[02:30:05.959 --> 02:30:10.060]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:16.983]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.
[02:30:17.243 --> 02:30:20.884]  Earth-friendly, pure soaps for bathing, laundry and kitchen.
[02:30:21.064 --> 02:30:24.405]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:30:24.725 --> 02:30:29.667]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:30:29.887 --> 02:30:30.427]  We're good to go.
[02:31:04.262 --> 02:31:08.245]  Is the NSA spying on United States Internet traffic?
[02:31:09.706 --> 02:31:19.313]  In a salon exclusive, they've uncovered two former AT&T employees saying that the telecom giant has maintained a secret, highly secure room in St.
[02:31:19.373 --> 02:31:20.774]  Louis since 2002.
[02:31:21.654 --> 02:31:27.338]  Intelligence experts say it bears the earmarks of a national security agency operation.
[02:31:27.639 --> 02:31:30.841]  Or as it used to be referred to as, no such agency.
[02:31:31.815 --> 02:31:36.562]  In a pivotal network operations center in the metropolitan St.
[02:31:36.622 --> 02:31:47.459]  Louis, AT&T has maintained a secret, highly secured room since 2002 where government work is being conducted according to two former AT&T workers once employed at the center.
[02:31:48.484 --> 02:32:02.454]  In interviews with Salon, the former AT&T worker said that only government officials or AT&T employees with top-secret security clearance are admitted to the room located inside AT&T's facility in Bridgeton.
[02:32:03.355 --> 02:32:13.122]  The room's tight security includes a biometric man-trap, quote-unquote, or highly sophisticated double door secured with retinal and fingerprint scanners...
[02:32:13.976 --> 02:32:18.099]  The former workers say company supervisors told them that employees working inside the
[02:32:22.324 --> 02:32:25.386]  And that the room was being used by a quote-unquote government agency.
[02:32:25.426 --> 02:32:38.975]  The details provided by the two former workers about the Bridgeton room bear the distinctive earmarks of an operation run by the National Security Agency, according to two intelligence experts with extensive knowledge of the NSA and its operations.
[02:32:39.075 --> 02:32:50.523]  In addition to the room's high-tech security, those intelligence experts told Salon that the exhaustive vetting process AT&T workers were put through before being granted top security clearance...
[02:32:50.883 --> 02:32:58.910]  And clearance points to the NSA, an agency known as much for its intense secrecy and technological sophistication.
[02:32:59.190 --> 02:33:03.134]  It was very hush-hush, said one former ANTT worker.
[02:33:03.814 --> 02:33:08.278]  Quote, we were told there was going to be some government personnel working in that room.
[02:33:08.478 --> 02:33:11.521]  We were told, do not try to speak to them.
[02:33:12.061 --> 02:33:13.182]  Do not hamper their work.
[02:33:13.202 --> 02:33:14.964]  Do not impede anything they're doing.
[02:33:14.984 --> 02:33:17.226]  And I'll add this, don't look them in the eye.
[02:33:19.059 --> 02:33:27.019]  The importance of the Bridgeton facility and its role in managing the quote, common backbone for all AT&T's internet operations.
[02:33:27.617 --> 02:33:39.926]  According to one former worker, Bridgeton serves as the technological command center from which the company manages all the routers and circuits carrying the company's domestic and international Internet traffic.
[02:33:39.966 --> 02:33:45.711]  Therefore, Bridgeton could be instrumental for conducting surveillance or collecting data.
[02:33:45.791 --> 02:33:53.637]  I would go a little farther than Salon here and say, most possibly, definitely, that is exactly what is going on.
[02:33:55.357 --> 02:33:57.738]  AT&T is involved in monitoring the Internet.
[02:33:58.298 --> 02:34:05.340]  They have massive security above and beyond all security provided in any general AT&T monitoring station.
[02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:07.541]  It has all the earmarks of the NSA.
[02:34:07.761 --> 02:34:11.362]  It most likely is exactly what they are alluding to in this article.
[02:34:11.722 --> 02:34:13.503]  By the way, you can find this at prisonplanet.com.
[02:34:14.269 --> 02:34:27.923]  If the NSA is using the secret room, it would appear to bolster recent allegations that the agency has been conducting broad and possibly illegal domestic surveillance and data collection operations authorized by the Bush administration after the terrorist attacks on 9-11-2001.
[02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:38.149]  AT&T's Bridgeton location would give the NSA potential access to enormous amounts of Internet data.
[02:34:38.249 --> 02:34:46.700]  Currently, the telecom giant controls approximately one-third of all bandwidth carrying Internet traffic to homes and businesses across the United States.
[02:34:47.620 --> 02:34:49.742]  Now, does that mean you should be paranoid?
[02:34:49.782 --> 02:34:56.688]  Does that mean that you should quiver in fear every time you stroke a key on your computer keyboard?
[02:34:57.008 --> 02:35:06.456]  Absolutely not, because they can't monitor all of us, they can't manage all of us, they can't take us all tomorrow and throw us all into camps, though I'm sure they would like to try.
[02:35:07.436 --> 02:35:11.800]  And the fact that we've, in a way, an article like this could have even been leaked,
[02:35:12.483 --> 02:35:17.526]  To try to evoke fear in you, because of course this does work in some cases.
[02:35:18.547 --> 02:35:24.371]  Though I know as bold as this audience is, that's not going to hamper you from continuing to fight the info war.
[02:35:24.911 --> 02:35:26.733]  Dan is calling in from Ohio.
[02:35:26.753 --> 02:35:28.254]  Dan, thank you for calling in and holding.
[02:35:28.274 --> 02:35:29.555]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:31.015 --> 02:35:31.776]  Paul in Ohio.
[02:35:32.496 --> 02:35:33.237]  Are you talking to me?
[02:35:33.397 --> 02:35:33.857]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:34.638 --> 02:35:35.639]  Oh, hi, this is Paul.
[02:35:36.399 --> 02:35:36.959]  Welcome, Paul.
[02:35:36.999 --> 02:35:37.600]  You're on the show.
[02:35:37.900 --> 02:35:38.320]  Hi, Jack.
[02:35:39.541 --> 02:35:40.582]  Um, yeah...
[02:35:41.018 --> 02:35:44.800]  There's definitely some kind of quickening and awakening going on.
[02:35:44.820 --> 02:35:50.703]  I mean, you have that great film coming out, A Scanner Darkly, that looks to be really good.
[02:35:50.723 --> 02:35:53.764]  You have the conference going on, everything else.
[02:35:54.084 --> 02:35:57.206]  And let me tell you about a little film called Land of the Blind.
[02:35:57.246 --> 02:35:58.166]  Have you heard about this?
[02:35:58.227 --> 02:35:59.227]  This is kind of our new 1984.
[02:35:59.827 --> 02:36:09.072]  It's a fictional, satirical look at the Orwellian society in which we live, and it stars Ralph Fiennes, Donald Sutherland, Lara Flynn Boyle,
[02:36:09.552 --> 02:36:16.776]  And if you go to my MySpace, by the way, my MySpace, Jack Blood MySpace, very easy to find me over there, folks, and you'll see Land of the Blind is in my top eight.
[02:36:16.816 --> 02:36:27.223]  But like V for Vendetta, like the brilliant speech given by James Spader on the court television program, now I'm having trouble remembering what it is.
[02:36:27.263 --> 02:36:27.863]  It'll come to me.
[02:36:29.617 --> 02:36:30.717]  Boston Legal, that's it.
[02:36:30.898 --> 02:36:39.443]  So all of these things really going together to try to, again, just even by osmosis, waking up a lot of people, getting a lot of people used to this information.
[02:36:39.463 --> 02:36:51.690]  I'll tell you, a lot of people from Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo got huge ovations at all the film festivals, and a lot of films were geared into this particular vein this year at all the film festivals.
[02:36:53.151 --> 02:36:57.294]  Yeah, and I wanted to tell you what I think it's attributed to.
[02:36:58.826 --> 02:37:02.988]  Have you heard that the North Star Polaris is not always the North Star?
[02:37:04.849 --> 02:37:08.931]  That it actually follows a 26,000 year processional wobble?
[02:37:09.452 --> 02:37:11.733]  I've read things like that and heard that on Coast to Coast.
[02:37:11.773 --> 02:37:15.955]  I don't know how much credence I put into a lot of that, but go ahead.
[02:37:16.496 --> 02:37:20.938]  I think it's like purely science that our Earth's axis wobbles.
[02:37:23.566 --> 02:37:27.788]  Science is subjective as to what you want the outcome to be.
[02:37:27.808 --> 02:37:29.108]  You do understand that, don't you?
[02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:34.491]  I mean, you could use scientific data to prove a lot of things.
[02:37:34.551 --> 02:37:40.934]  Not conclusively, certainly, but to get you close enough to a conclusion that you already wanted to arrive to.
[02:37:40.954 --> 02:37:43.395]  We've seen that happen certainly over and over again.
[02:37:43.415 --> 02:37:50.499]  So you think that the North Star is doing some gravitational pull and getting people out of their paradigms.
[02:37:50.519 --> 02:37:51.379]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:37:53.190 --> 02:38:09.125]  Well, Alex Jones used to report about how the sun's activity is increasing, and one of the main things is that our north axis will become the closest pointing to the North Star Polaris around the year 2012.
[02:38:10.126 --> 02:38:14.190]  We've always considered it to be the North Star, but it won't actually be.
[02:38:16.129 --> 02:38:17.889]  I mean, it'll be the closest at 2012.
[02:38:17.949 --> 02:38:19.830]  Well, let me just be honest with you.
[02:38:19.850 --> 02:38:24.471]  I don't know enough about this, and I don't put enough credence in it to even really comment on it.
[02:38:24.551 --> 02:38:31.112]  But, hey, look, I mean, I appreciate you looking in and investigating it, and I guess that's an aspect we can look at.
[02:38:31.532 --> 02:38:33.933]  I'm just, for some reason, stuck in reality.
[02:38:34.173 --> 02:38:34.693]  My problem.
[02:38:35.153 --> 02:38:36.373]  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[02:38:37.114 --> 02:38:38.234]  Can I throw out a website?
[02:38:38.894 --> 02:38:39.234]  Why not?
[02:38:39.946 --> 02:38:45.568]  Alright, this is for the World 13 Moon Calendar Change Peace Movement and the Plant Art Network.
[02:38:45.768 --> 02:38:49.689]  It's at tortuga.com and lawoftime.org.
[02:38:51.230 --> 02:39:01.213]  And they basically say that the Catholic Church has used our Catholic calendar that everyone uses unconsciously to basically corrupt our character at its core.
[02:39:03.112 --> 02:39:03.332]  Right.
[02:39:03.452 --> 02:39:05.933]  Well, again, there might be something to this, Paul.
[02:39:05.973 --> 02:39:09.495]  I'm just probably not the guy you want to talk to about it, but I appreciate the call.
[02:39:09.655 --> 02:39:10.235]  Thank you so much.
[02:39:10.275 --> 02:39:10.855]  Have a great day.
[02:39:10.875 --> 02:39:11.416]  Keep the faith.
[02:39:11.816 --> 02:39:13.817]  Gene in Texas, thank you for holding.
[02:39:13.837 --> 02:39:15.097]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:16.198 --> 02:39:17.158]  Yes, Jack.
[02:39:17.198 --> 02:39:28.543]  You have to deal with these people that have been brainwashed by these major talk show people like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hamney, against conspiracies.
[02:39:29.223 --> 02:39:30.764]  And how I do that, basically...
[02:39:31.977 --> 02:39:34.038]  Of course, I have a background in history.
[02:39:34.558 --> 02:39:44.703]  So, first of all, if they call me a conspiracy theorist, I'll say, well, are you a non-conspiracy theorist?
[02:39:45.343 --> 02:39:46.684]  That's a pretty good retort.
[02:39:46.844 --> 02:39:47.464]  I like that.
[02:39:47.724 --> 02:39:47.904]  Yeah.
[02:39:48.364 --> 02:39:49.085]  I don't believe it.
[02:39:49.105 --> 02:39:52.006]  Because who's going to say they don't believe in conspiracies?
[02:39:52.126 --> 02:39:52.306]  Yeah.
[02:39:53.007 --> 02:39:55.069]  And I just kind of throw it back at them.
[02:39:55.169 --> 02:39:57.351]  Instead of them putting me on the defensive, that's what it is.
[02:39:57.371 --> 02:39:58.412]  It's a defensive tactic.
[02:39:58.652 --> 02:40:01.614]  They want to put you on the defensive by calling you a conspiracy theorist.
[02:40:01.634 --> 02:40:02.935]  It's semantics, okay?
[02:40:02.995 --> 02:40:06.238]  How are we going to ever arrive to a fact if we don't have theories?
[02:40:06.258 --> 02:40:11.823]  I mean, this is done every day in police departments all around the country in multiple murder investigations.
[02:40:12.023 --> 02:40:12.683]  That's right.
[02:40:12.904 --> 02:40:15.946]  I've studied criminology, too, and that's definitely true.
[02:40:16.206 --> 02:40:21.250]  And so, of course, there's a difference between opinions, theories, and facts and evidence.
[02:40:21.451 --> 02:40:21.551]  And...
[02:40:22.846 --> 02:40:28.872]  I just say, well, you know, if you go into world history, Julius Caesar was murdered in a conspiracy.
[02:40:30.073 --> 02:40:32.154]  Even Christ Jesus was murdered in a conspiracy.
[02:40:32.315 --> 02:40:32.535]  Right.
[02:40:32.655 --> 02:40:39.521]  And I say the Bible, even in Ezekiel 22, verse 25, talks about a world conspiracy.
[02:40:40.006 --> 02:40:40.987]  But you hit on something.
[02:40:41.007 --> 02:40:41.947]  Let me interrupt you for one second.
[02:40:41.987 --> 02:40:42.668]  I'm sorry to do that.
[02:40:42.688 --> 02:40:44.649]  But you hit on something that I want to point out.
[02:40:44.689 --> 02:40:55.156]  Because part of the problem is, is that we get a lot of people out there with their theories, so convinced of their theories with nothing to back them up, that they try to present them as fact, as the quote-unquote truth.
[02:40:55.196 --> 02:40:56.657]  I'll remind you what Bill Cooper says.
[02:40:56.897 --> 02:40:57.978]  There are many truths.
[02:40:58.058 --> 02:41:06.924]  So we actually do ourselves a disservice and play right into the hands of the New World Order when we don't have the evidence, when we can't verify and back up what we're saying,
[02:41:09.947 --> 02:41:10.133]  True.
[02:41:10.822 --> 02:41:16.483]  Yeah, well, fortunately, I have a background in history and theology, so I can usually back up what I say to these people.
[02:41:16.623 --> 02:41:29.506]  It doesn't mean that you can't put out a theory and say, hey, here's my theory on how this happened, and here's what some of the evidence is that might back this up, but still, we're still investigating it, and then, hey, man, there's nothing wrong with being conspiracy theorists.
[02:41:29.526 --> 02:41:34.508]  Is something wrong, though, with passing off a theory as fact when you don't have the evidence to back it up, Gene?
[02:41:34.888 --> 02:41:39.769]  No, I mean, in fact, in the scientific community...
[02:41:41.133 --> 02:41:47.036]  Most of the things that have been discovered in the scientific community have started out as theories.
[02:41:47.296 --> 02:41:47.796]  Exactly.
[02:41:48.056 --> 02:41:52.038]  Now, I'm not talking about evolution, which I don't believe in, of course, which is still a theory.
[02:41:52.498 --> 02:41:53.839]  I don't believe it's a true one, of course.
[02:41:53.879 --> 02:42:03.503]  But there's been a lot of scientific discoveries and even modern technological things that we have today that started out as theories or science fiction.
[02:42:04.023 --> 02:42:05.924]  You don't believe in evolution, natural selection?
[02:42:06.424 --> 02:42:06.504]  No.
[02:42:07.273 --> 02:42:08.196]  Not at all.
[02:42:08.236 --> 02:42:10.302]  There is some scientific data to back that up.
[02:42:10.583 --> 02:42:14.955]  In a variety of species, I think where we sometimes get confused is that
[02:42:15.541 --> 02:42:28.572]  We're told that we came from apes, and that that can be proven through science, and I think regarding the human species as we are today, the fact that we came through natural selection and evolution is something that I think can be debated.
[02:42:28.592 --> 02:42:38.100]  But there's certainly some creatures that have evolved through time to be able to survive in a certain environment, and that's something that's hard to argue with, Gene.
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:43.705]  Well, I know, but I believe every creature had an original parent, though, of course, and
[02:42:44.399 --> 02:42:46.081]  And you don't get something from nothing.
[02:42:46.161 --> 02:42:54.610]  So you had to have what even atheists call intelligent design that started everything.
[02:42:55.171 --> 02:42:59.554]  And so you can't rule out an intelligent creator or creator.
[02:42:59.574 --> 02:43:01.015]  I'm going to agree with you on that.
[02:43:01.075 --> 02:43:05.698]  That way we won't, and I do agree, by the way, but that way we won't have to have a 20-minute debate on this as well.
[02:43:05.878 --> 02:43:06.619]  Hey, let me say this.
[02:43:06.659 --> 02:43:21.569]  I've got to take a few calls here, too, but you reminded me of something that I wanted to mention on today's show, and that is I have heard, and I believe this is going to happen, Jim Fetzer from the Scholars for Truth, who will be speaking at the conference this weekend, will be on Hannity and Combs tonight!
[02:43:22.149 --> 02:43:22.250]  Oh!
[02:43:23.270 --> 02:43:23.891]  That'll be good.
[02:43:24.111 --> 02:43:36.218]  He's going to be talking about what we talked about extensively yesterday, the bin Laden poster and the fact that Rex Toome over at the FBI, quote-unquote, said there's no hard evidence pinning 9-11 on bin Laden.
[02:43:36.238 --> 02:43:38.560]  That's one of the things he's going to try to get through to Sean Vanity.
[02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:47.005]  Well, let me tell you, even in 1996 when Sudan had Osama bin Laden, and we're going to hand him over to the United States government,
[02:43:47.492 --> 02:43:54.520]  The United States government said we don't want him because there's not enough evidence that he was behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:56.122]  Oh, those pesky liberals, huh, Gene?
[02:43:56.343 --> 02:43:58.866]  So, you know, I mean, what I'm saying, they have to have a boogeyman.
[02:43:58.906 --> 02:43:59.667]  You have to understand.
[02:44:00.187 --> 02:44:04.112]  They had to let Osama bin Laden escape from the Toro Toro Mountains there.
[02:44:04.856 --> 02:44:16.942]  In order to keep him as the boogeyman, as the phantom behind all of these supposed... Well, they've made Al-Qaeda... Look, they're not even trying to push that as much anymore.
[02:44:16.983 --> 02:44:19.644]  They've made Al-Qaeda the boogeyman in general.
[02:44:19.904 --> 02:44:27.509]  Trying to pass off the illusion that this is some organized organization that makes joint statements and all of this.
[02:44:27.749 --> 02:44:28.330]  But you're right.
[02:44:28.370 --> 02:44:29.571]  That's exactly what we've got.
[02:44:29.651 --> 02:44:31.812]  Emanuel Goldstein on steroids.
[02:44:31.852 --> 02:44:33.714]  We don't need to fight the commies anymore.
[02:44:33.934 --> 02:44:34.894]  We've got terrorists.
[02:44:34.954 --> 02:44:35.655]  And guess what?
[02:44:36.135 --> 02:44:39.478]  Everybody can be a terrorist, just like everybody could have been a communist.
[02:44:39.498 --> 02:44:40.478]  Gene, you're a good caller.
[02:44:40.498 --> 02:44:41.759]  I wish we had more time for you.
[02:44:42.059 --> 02:44:43.981]  Greg in Kansas, thank you for calling in.
[02:44:44.001 --> 02:44:45.141]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:45.962 --> 02:44:46.742]  Hey, what's up, Jack?
[02:44:47.083 --> 02:44:47.343]  What's up?
[02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:52.612]  Hey, do you ever get the feeling that the government kind of portrayed Al-Qaeda kind of like being Cobra from G.I.
[02:44:52.632 --> 02:44:52.892]  Joe?
[02:44:53.873 --> 02:44:55.134]  No.
[02:44:55.174 --> 02:44:57.555]  Yeah, I mean, just because... But I'm not that familiar with G.I.
[02:44:57.595 --> 02:45:04.098]  Joe, so... Well, I was just saying, you know, they try to make it to be like it's this, you know, huge thing that, you know...
[02:45:05.039 --> 02:45:09.382]  Anyway... I had a six million dollar man doll when I was a kid.
[02:45:09.422 --> 02:45:10.382]  I didn't go for the G.I.
[02:45:10.402 --> 02:45:17.006]  Joe, so I was more into the half-human, half-cyborg, you know, which I guess was setting me up for what we're seeing today.
[02:45:17.526 --> 02:45:19.067]  No, but I understand what you're saying.
[02:45:19.107 --> 02:45:19.387]  Go ahead.
[02:45:20.068 --> 02:45:24.010]  Yeah, I just wanted to say I was one of the info warriors that he did the call to call C-SPAN this morning.
[02:45:24.210 --> 02:45:24.710]  Attaboy!
[02:45:25.310 --> 02:45:26.471]  Look what you did!
[02:45:26.531 --> 02:45:27.472]  Aren't you proud of yourself?
[02:45:27.492 --> 02:45:28.032]  You should be.
[02:45:28.572 --> 02:45:29.493]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[02:45:29.593 --> 02:45:33.315]  I told them that I was going to look forward to them unbiasedly covering the event, and...
[02:45:34.352 --> 02:45:36.813]  So hopefully that kind of put them on the spot a little bit.
[02:45:37.073 --> 02:45:46.238]  Well, they may not cover it in an unbiased fashion, but it seems to me that they're going to be running some of the speeches, and I'm sure they'll try to do some editorial on top of that.
[02:45:46.278 --> 02:45:50.400]  And hopefully they will do that, and the evidence will get a chance to speak for itself.
[02:45:50.440 --> 02:45:54.542]  And I think this could even be better than the David Ray Griffin speech that they ran a while back.
[02:45:55.442 --> 02:46:00.164]  This has the potential to really get the debate going in the right direction.
[02:46:00.184 --> 02:46:04.406]  And if they actually do this, I think we're going to have to really compliment them for doing that.
[02:46:04.526 --> 02:46:04.826]  Okay?
[02:46:05.366 --> 02:46:06.166]  Oh, definitely, definitely.
[02:46:06.767 --> 02:46:13.369]  About the Walmart thing and the number 10 cans, I actually try to stock up on the ready-to-reserve food and stuff.
[02:46:13.710 --> 02:46:14.090]  Yeah.
[02:46:14.130 --> 02:46:17.471]  And I noticed that Mountain House is one of the companies that produces it.
[02:46:17.531 --> 02:46:19.532]  They were actually on backorder for several months.
[02:46:19.632 --> 02:46:22.353]  So, I mean, I guess that kind of ties into the story there.
[02:46:23.414 --> 02:46:24.134]  Sure, sure.
[02:46:24.174 --> 02:46:24.374]  Go ahead.
[02:46:25.256 --> 02:46:47.404]  I was just going to say, another thing is too, I guess one of the reasons why a lot of people don't accept the alternative theories, or they criticize people who think the way we do, it's just that a lot of the schools, like I'm a college student, and pretty much if you're not a neoliberal or pro-UN, pro-sustainable development, you get ostracized.
[02:46:48.695 --> 02:46:48.935]  Right.
[02:46:48.975 --> 02:46:51.497]  Well, I mean, really what this comes down to is groupthink.
[02:46:51.517 --> 02:46:56.640]  And I've got to tell you, I watched Bush give his speech at the 2004 coronation.
[02:46:56.701 --> 02:46:58.662]  I was probably 50 feet from him.
[02:46:59.204 --> 02:47:04.026]  And I was surrounded by people who were crying, literally crying.
[02:47:04.106 --> 02:47:11.589]  I mean, here's Bush standing in this giant occult symbol telling us how we've got to fight terrorism and give up our liberties and yada, yada, yada, right?
[02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:14.111]  And people were literally crying.
[02:47:14.131 --> 02:47:19.613]  And I've got to tell you, I found myself working with Fox News covertly the whole time.
[02:47:19.953 --> 02:47:24.575]  And I had caught myself a few times going, maybe Bush isn't so bad after all.
[02:47:24.655 --> 02:47:26.416]  I mean, it's really contagious.
[02:47:26.756 --> 02:47:33.999]  And anything that isn't conducive to global groupthink will be pounded out, hammered out, ferreted out, and punished.
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:38.901]  Well, it's funny that you brought that up because he actually came to speak at my university several months back.
[02:47:38.981 --> 02:47:43.984]  And, you know, I told people I wasn't going to go to listen to him and everything because I didn't support the guy.
[02:47:44.284 --> 02:47:45.985]  And they're like, well, you need to respect the office.
[02:47:46.045 --> 02:47:47.885]  And I'm like, well, he's a public servant, you know.
[02:47:47.925 --> 02:47:49.146]  So, you know.
[02:47:50.355 --> 02:47:53.537]  The only person I respect wholeheartedly is God.
[02:47:53.557 --> 02:47:55.377]  You've got a lot of stuff to do up there in Kansas.
[02:47:55.397 --> 02:47:58.939]  You've got the new border moving up to Kansas, I guess.
[02:47:59.299 --> 02:48:05.042]  And we just reported this NSA AT&T spying room up there in Kansas as well, in Bridgeton.
[02:48:05.222 --> 02:48:07.423]  A lot of work to do there in Kansas.
[02:48:07.483 --> 02:48:10.344]  Maybe you'll be the capital of the new world order United States.
[02:48:10.364 --> 02:48:10.804]  Who knows?
[02:48:10.864 --> 02:48:12.465]  But you're right there in ground zero.
[02:48:12.705 --> 02:48:14.726]  Greg, I appreciate you fighting the good fight.
[02:48:14.946 --> 02:48:16.507]  Let's go to Dave in California.
[02:48:16.547 --> 02:48:18.187]  Dave, thank you for holding so long.
[02:48:18.207 --> 02:48:19.308]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:19.827 --> 02:48:20.508]  Jack, thank you.
[02:48:20.928 --> 02:48:22.849]  I got a 9-11 scoop for you.
[02:48:23.189 --> 02:48:25.191]  You want to hold and bring that up on the next segment?
[02:48:25.211 --> 02:48:25.791]  I'll be happy to.
[02:48:25.811 --> 02:48:26.151]  All right.
[02:48:26.191 --> 02:48:28.973]  We'll finish up with Dave in California with a 9-11 scoop.
[02:48:29.013 --> 02:48:31.875]  Final segment on today's show, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:31.975 --> 02:48:33.016]  Infowars.com.
[02:48:33.056 --> 02:48:34.097]  PrismPlanet.com.
[02:48:34.117 --> 02:48:34.577]  Stay tuned.
[02:48:46.326 --> 02:48:50.652]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.852 --> 02:48:55.198]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:57.500 --> 02:48:59.821]  Use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:48:59.901 --> 02:49:02.703]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:49:02.963 --> 02:49:07.185]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.265 --> 02:49:14.189]  We rip the Senator-Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:16.330]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:27.035]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.315 --> 02:49:32.677]  If you want to understand what the new rule of order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:49:47.892 --> 02:49:58.595]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:58.975 --> 02:50:03.496]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:03.556 --> 02:50:14.899]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.359 --> 02:50:15.960]  You're good to go.

[02:51:47.507 --> 02:51:52.669]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:53.330 --> 02:51:55.651]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:52:02.082 --> 02:52:05.004]  Well, thanks for joining us today, folks, for the last three hours.
[02:52:05.604 --> 02:52:15.207]  We have Dar Jamal coming up briefly tomorrow to give us some updates on what's going on in Iraq and Ramadi and with all of these killings on both sides, this phony sectarian violence, P2OG.
[02:52:16.128 --> 02:52:18.449]  Dar Jamal was an unembedded reporter in Iraq.
[02:52:19.189 --> 02:52:30.153]  I will be back right after this show for two more hours and my guests will be joining me to talk about the psychiatric control mechanisms put out there for our children and for all of us
[02:52:30.678 --> 02:52:32.099]  A very, very important show.
[02:52:32.119 --> 02:52:36.680]  We'll also be covering a lot of news and taking all the calls that we have left over from this program as well.
[02:52:36.880 --> 02:52:39.321]  We'll finish up with Dave in California today.
[02:52:39.561 --> 02:52:41.882]  Dave, you have some new 9-11 info for us.
[02:52:41.902 --> 02:52:42.342]  Go for it.
[02:52:42.702 --> 02:52:43.082]  Thank you.
[02:52:43.102 --> 02:52:51.826]  I'm a member of the Scholars for 9-11 Truth, and I attend their forum and read their published... Is it true that Jim Fetzer is going to be on Hannity & Combs tonight?
[02:52:52.326 --> 02:52:52.866]  I don't know that.
[02:52:52.966 --> 02:52:53.886]  I haven't checked today.
[02:52:53.906 --> 02:52:54.526]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:52:54.867 --> 02:52:55.407]  Okay, well, anyway...
[02:52:57.234 --> 02:53:20.536]  One of the members is a physicist, and he's publishing soon in a peer-reviewed manner, pretty intensely peer-reviewed, judging from what I've seen, that because steel beams, like the steel beams that were in the columns of 9-11, compressed like springs 3% of their length, any collapse, even up to three floors collapsing and impacting on the floor below...
[02:53:22.717 --> 02:53:28.541]  A certain amount of energy gets absorbed by 58 meters worth of the steel below.
[02:53:28.561 --> 02:53:31.863]  In other words, it's not just one floor onto another.
[02:53:31.883 --> 02:53:34.765]  This dispels the pancake theory, in other words.
[02:53:35.225 --> 02:53:39.648]  Yeah, and he's been able to do this mathematically very well.
[02:53:40.008 --> 02:53:50.435]  The columns basically absorb one half of the momentum before the collapsing floor strikes the floor below, which gives a four times...
[02:53:51.078 --> 02:53:53.619]  Reduction in energy by the inverse square law.
[02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:58.802]  This is all easily provable, and he does a really excellent job of it.
[02:53:59.242 --> 02:54:08.127]  Anyway, so what it amounts to is even if three floors gave way and hit the floor below, there would be a deficit in the amount of energy to continue the collapse.
[02:54:09.067 --> 02:54:17.772]  So even if it was possible for the fires to be hot enough, and even if there was damage from the flames and all that, it's still impossible for the towers to come down from that particular impact.
[02:54:18.664 --> 02:54:19.164]  Absolutely.
[02:54:19.285 --> 02:54:21.106]  Well, this is actually what we've been saying all along.
[02:54:21.146 --> 02:54:33.955]  There was a lot of at least circumstantial evidence, and more and more we're getting, like you say, mathematical equations, extrapolations, and pure physics to prove that the government is lying to us, and they're a bunch of conspiracy theorists.
[02:54:34.235 --> 02:54:34.935]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:54:35.575 --> 02:54:37.616]  Hey, Dave, are you going to be out to the conference this weekend?
[02:54:37.656 --> 02:54:39.676]  Man, I would love to be out there, but I just couldn't do it.
[02:54:39.956 --> 02:54:41.596]  Make sure we get this information now.
[02:54:41.996 --> 02:54:49.018]  If somebody isn't going to send it to us, when this new report comes out, if it sounds like something that we don't already have, make sure to send it to both Alex and myself.
[02:54:49.058 --> 02:54:52.198]  We'll put it up on our websites and make sure it gets around to everybody, okay?
[02:54:52.418 --> 02:54:52.698]  Okay.
[02:54:52.898 --> 02:54:54.158]  Can you hold me over for a second?
[02:54:54.718 --> 02:54:58.539]  If you give me a private email address, I can copy some of this stuff and send it to you.
[02:54:58.839 --> 02:55:03.380]  Well, I'll just give you the one that everybody has, deadlineliveatyahoo.com.
[02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:04.040]  Okay.
[02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:05.641]  And that's the one at my website.
[02:55:05.661 --> 02:55:08.863]  And, of course, Alex Jones' tips at Infowars.com.
[02:55:08.883 --> 02:55:09.403]  Uh-huh.
[02:55:09.883 --> 02:55:11.184]  And we'll get both of those.
[02:55:11.204 --> 02:55:15.687]  We have people looking at all of our emails to cipher through all of the tips that we get.
[02:55:15.747 --> 02:55:20.089]  But, yeah, make sure to mark this new 9-11 evidence from Scholars for Truth.
[02:55:20.349 --> 02:55:20.549]  Okay.
[02:55:20.689 --> 02:55:21.970]  And we'll get right to it.
[02:55:22.010 --> 02:55:23.791]  Hey, Dave, I appreciate your input, man.
[02:55:23.811 --> 02:55:24.331]  No problem.
[02:55:24.351 --> 02:55:25.432]  Have fun out there at the conference.
[02:55:25.512 --> 02:55:26.172]  We're going to.
[02:55:26.192 --> 02:55:27.073]  We're going to have fun.
[02:55:27.093 --> 02:55:27.813]  That's right, folks.
[02:55:27.873 --> 02:55:32.436]  We will be dancing on the heads of the New World Order out in Los Angeles for this weekend.
[02:55:32.496 --> 02:55:36.898]  And I'm actually going to hang over for a few extra days to do some other business out there as well.
[02:55:36.958 --> 02:55:38.619]  But, you know, this is what it's all about, isn't it?
[02:55:38.879 --> 02:55:39.740]  Getting us all together.
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:40.520]  People coming from all over the world.
[02:55:40.780 --> 02:55:48.088]  All around the world in a like-minded fashion to look at the real evidence, not the theories, that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:55:48.148 --> 02:55:52.573]  If you're hearing that for the first time and it shocked you, take a few minutes to start looking at the evidence.
[02:55:52.593 --> 02:55:56.017]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 o'clock Central Time on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:56.277 --> 02:55:58.520]  Until then, well, I'll see you in about six minutes.
