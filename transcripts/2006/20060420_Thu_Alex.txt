[00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:10.068]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:11.549]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.191]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:17.834]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.103]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:34.427]  We're 30 seconds into this first hour of this live three-hour broadcast.
[00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:39.288]  20th day of April 2006.
[00:00:43.170 --> 00:01:03.904]  Coming up, psychologist, good friend of mine, Bill Vieth, who's an expert on the New World Order, another great Austinite, will be joining us in studio to talk about the world banking system and leaving the Bretton Woods Agreement, why the dollar is plunging, why we see gold exploding and crude oil prices having a skyrocket rise in prices.
[00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:08.880]  It's all coming up in the next hour, and we'll have open phones as well.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:25.769]  Then we've got, well, the author of Adventures in Legal Land, Scott Stevens, joining us coming up in the third hour, just to get into the corruption of the court systems here in the United States, and how there really is no rule of law, and his view that no state is legitimate.
[00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.892]  In the meantime, we'll be taking your calls and covering the news.
[00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:31.872]  Gold hit 640
[00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:38.458]  Dollars an ounce yesterday before dropping back down to $638.
[00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:39.639]  On Monday it hit, what, $608, then it hit $614.
[00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:40.820]  On Tuesday, again going to $640.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.284]  On Wednesday, and now it's Thursday, we'll tell you by the end of the broadcast where gold is at.
[00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:46.185]  Crude has gone above $74 a barrel.
[00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:02.535]  It's trading above that.
[00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:05.398]  Last time I checked, about 10 minutes ago.
[00:02:06.098 --> 00:02:11.043]  Meanwhile, Bush on the heels of the Chinese President visiting Boeing and Microsoft.
[00:02:11.713 --> 00:02:27.023]  And by the way, there were some cryptic statements made, that's the Associated Press' words, cryptic statements made about free speech on the internet by Bill Gates, then the murderer-in-chief, the criminal-in-chief, the Chinese president, hopped on his airplane and flew out to D.C.
[00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:28.384]  to meet with Lord Bush this morning.
[00:02:28.784 --> 00:02:39.251]  There was a heckler bringing up the fact that China steals the organs of murdered Falun Gong members, and there were Taiwanese protesters as well, but the protester that heckled
[00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:42.574]  Them during their press conference was drugged out.
[00:02:43.514 --> 00:02:46.597]  So we'll get into that for you as well.
[00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:52.802]  At the same time, Chinese man admits to plot to import 200 missiles.
[00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:55.465]  Each missile could shoot down a large passenger airliner.
[00:02:55.485 --> 00:03:00.409]  And of course it leads back to the Communist Chinese military.
[00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:05.113]  This is right out of Reuters, Washington Times, Associated Press, you name it.
[00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:16.140]  And by the way, the Communist Chinese were caught shipping in shoulder-fired missiles, and what, 3,000 plus AK-47s, and a bunch of heroin back in 1997.
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.183]  That's in my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:26.469]  And so they were rewarded the next year with a Long Beach Naval Base, Panama Canal, many other places, and now they're running security.
[00:03:27.432 --> 00:03:30.253]  In the Bahamas, and the nuclear scanning equipment.
[00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:40.995]  But when a cop pulls you over in the middle of this country, say in Indiana, and wants to search your car, and without a warrant he'll say, it's a post 9-11 atmosphere.
[00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:43.476]  We're doing this to keep you safe.
[00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:55.659]  There's been a ridiculous raid, they're calling it the biggest ever, 1,000 illegal aliens and their bosses arrested from Texas to California.
[00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:08.144]  There are conservatively 25 million illegal aliens, 20 million that are Mexican, 5 million others Russians, Chinese, Indians, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans.
[00:04:10.263 --> 00:04:13.924]  And, uh, the real numbers that I think are the most accurate show over 30 million now.
[00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:24.268]  So when you think a thousand sounds big, uh, last year, this same time, they raided, remember, Walmart distribution centers and then a couple lumberyards and arrested, what was it, over 500?
[00:04:24.588 --> 00:04:25.388]  Ooooooh!
[00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:26.789]  Ooooooh!
[00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:29.870]  That's like taking a thimble out of a swimming pool!
[00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.611]  I mean, what is a thousand arrests?
[00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:34.952]  Oh, they're getting tough!
[00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:35.252]  We can...
[00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:44.105]  We can all go back to sleep now, so I'm going to get into this and some of the new Larry Conquista open border news and the latest Iran news.
[00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:48.567]  It's all coming up in a big news blitz after this quick break.
[00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:51.348]  As we enter the second segment, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:04:51.368 --> 00:04:53.529]  The websites are JonesReport.com.
[00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:54.690]  Updated daily now.
[00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.892]  MartialLaw911.info, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:02.454 --> 00:05:05.295]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.341]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:13.289]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.816]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:19.117 --> 00:05:20.739]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.261]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:27.203]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.463 --> 00:05:32.106]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:34.928]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:38.451]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:40.312]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:42.873]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.600]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.301]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.622]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.882]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.942 --> 00:06:09.125]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:12.167]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:14.749]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:23.576]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.137]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:29.480]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.241]  We're good to go!
[00:06:48.803 --> 00:06:49.403]  We're good to go.
[00:07:01.306 --> 00:07:11.574]  TriVortex Technology features subtle energy products that include an item called Tri-Vibes that allow you to save hundreds of dollars by wearing rather than orally taking vitamins and nutrients.
[00:07:12.074 --> 00:07:20.420]  When you purchase TriVortex Technology products, you make possible outstanding GCN programs such as the Power Hour, Alex Jones, Jack Blood, and Greg Simansky.
[00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:29.507]  The GCN staff and countless GCN listeners benefit from TriVortex Technology products on a daily basis to increase energy levels and for fast pain relief.
[00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:40.548]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com, or call me, Brian, at 619-884-1455.
[00:07:41.468 --> 00:07:47.550]  Yes, everything about TriVortex technology, including fast pain relief, is real, true, and honest.
[00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:59.265]  Help GCN grow and thrive by clicking on Tribortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com, or call me, Brian, at 619-884-1455.
[00:08:02.687 --> 00:08:08.711]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.332 --> 00:08:12.314]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.012 --> 00:08:29.756]  I figured I'd start the second segment here in this first hour before I get into the Communist Chinese murdering despot as bad as Hitler visiting Boeing, Microsoft, and now President Bush, and they drug a... I wouldn't call it a heckler.
[00:08:30.356 --> 00:08:37.618]  They drug out a daring Falun Gong demonstrator who just simply brought up that they run death camps and murder people for their organs.
[00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:41.199]  I mean, it doesn't get any more Nazi-like and macabre, and it's admitted they do this.
[00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:43.987]  And our media acts like it's debatable.
[00:08:44.007 --> 00:08:49.910]  Well, the Falun Gong claims this, and China says that they're a deadly, dangerous cult.
[00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.311]  They're a totally peaceful group.
[00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:54.872]  No history of anything bad.
[00:08:54.892 --> 00:08:58.194]  No history of even stepping on a cockroach.
[00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.775]  But no, China says they're bad.
[00:09:01.815 --> 00:09:03.636]  So our media, pardon me, they're bad.
[00:09:03.696 --> 00:09:04.877]  China says they're bad.
[00:09:05.217 --> 00:09:06.257]  We'll get into all that.
[00:09:06.357 --> 00:09:07.818]  Gold hitting $640 an ounce yesterday.
[00:09:12.473 --> 00:09:13.213]  We're good to go.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.180]  I don't know.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.580]  I don't know.
[00:09:50.348 --> 00:09:59.236]  Except for a little slight anti-Christian comment, because people think Bush is supposedly a Christian, and they really believe the propaganda that he's being led by God.
[00:09:59.576 --> 00:10:05.802]  Yeah, he's being led by God, but he's being led by the God of this world that tempted Christ on the mountain.
[00:10:06.082 --> 00:10:08.504]  Or attempted to tempt Christ on the mountain.
[00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:10.206]  God of this world.
[00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:12.268]  But let's go ahead and roll this little piece.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.562]  And on Friday I stood up and said I don't appreciate the speculation about Don Rumsfeld.
[00:10:18.582 --> 00:10:19.662]  He's doing a fine job.
[00:10:19.722 --> 00:10:20.743]  I strongly support him.
[00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:26.985]  But what do you say to critics who believe that you're ignoring the advice of retired generals, military commanders, who say that there needs to be a change?
[00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:44.360]  I.M.D.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:49.123]  and Remy's here and it's free and we're all together.
[00:10:49.423 --> 00:10:53.886]  See the world burn when Dick shoots his gun.
[00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:55.427]  See how I lie.
[00:10:56.307 --> 00:10:57.588]  I'm lying.
[00:10:57.628 --> 00:11:01.451]  Sitting on my own brain.
[00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:05.493]  Waiting for the end of days.
[00:11:07.719 --> 00:11:10.282]  Corporation profits, bloody oil money.
[00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:13.485]  I'm above the law and I'll decide what's right or wrong.
[00:11:15.387 --> 00:11:16.748]  I am the egghead.
[00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:19.531]  I'm the commander.
[00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:22.354]  I'm the decider.
[00:11:22.634 --> 00:11:25.196]  Cuckoos that you bag that city.
[00:11:25.317 --> 00:11:27.419]  Policemen sitting pretty.
[00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:29.501]  Little targets in a row.
[00:11:32.096 --> 00:11:41.301]  Seein' how they die when strapped no fly to see mothers cry I'm lyin' I'm lyin' I'm lyin' I'm lyin' Yellow tape to pull me up Imaginary WMD
[00:12:01.856 --> 00:12:04.038]  I am the egghead.
[00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:05.359]  I'm the commander.
[00:12:05.499 --> 00:12:12.645]  I'm the decider.
[00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:17.969]  Cuckoo choo!
[00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:23.533]  I'm the decider and I decide what is best and what's best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain as the Secretary of Defense.
[00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:29.398]  Sitting in a White House garden talking to the Lord.
[00:12:30.683 --> 00:12:34.765]  Well, my thoughts would be busy, busy hatching if I only had a brain.
[00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:36.166]  I am Big Head!
[00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:39.648]  I'm the commander!
[00:12:41.843 --> 00:12:42.443]  I'm the decider!
[00:12:42.483 --> 00:13:04.253]  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:13.098]  I'm the decider.
[00:13:13.498 --> 00:13:19.724]  In fact, let's play that clip from a press conference Bush had a couple days ago, where he says, I'm the decider.
[00:13:19.764 --> 00:13:21.305]  Not, I'm the decision-maker.
[00:13:21.945 --> 00:13:23.126]  I'm the decider.
[00:13:23.146 --> 00:13:29.292]  And then they bring up all these generals, in fact, who've been in theater in Iraq, saying the whole thing's a horrible disaster.
[00:13:29.712 --> 00:13:36.217]  Fire Rumsfeld now, and he just snickers and giggles at first, totally out of place.
[00:13:37.719 --> 00:13:38.619]  It's just amazing.
[00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:39.260]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:44.077]  Mr. President, you've made it a practice of not commenting on potential personnel moves.
[00:13:44.097 --> 00:13:44.837]  Of course I did.
[00:13:44.877 --> 00:13:45.718]  Calling it speculation.
[00:13:45.738 --> 00:13:46.758]  You can understand why.
[00:13:47.218 --> 00:13:49.839]  Because we got people's reputations at stake.
[00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:54.980]  And on Friday I stood up and said I don't appreciate the speculation about Don Rumsfeld.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.061]  He's doing a fine job.
[00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:57.161]  I strongly support him.
[00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:03.483]  But what do you say to critics who believe that you're ignoring the advice of retired generals, military commanders, who say that there needs to be a change?
[00:14:04.303 --> 00:14:05.543]  I say I listen to all voices.
[00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:07.584]  But mine's the final decision.
[00:14:08.286 --> 00:14:10.908]  And Don Rumsfeld is doing a fine job.
[00:14:11.288 --> 00:14:15.631]  He's not only transforming the military, he's fighting a war on terror.
[00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:17.072]  He's helping us fight a war on terror.
[00:14:17.432 --> 00:14:19.333]  I have strong confidence in Don Rumsfeld.
[00:14:19.373 --> 00:14:29.660]  I hear the voices, and I read the front page, and I know the speculation, but I'm the decider, and I decide what is best, and what's best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain as the Secretary of Defense.
[00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:33.142]  Okay, so you're the decider.
[00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:36.237]  And I've heard the neocons spin on talk radio.
[00:14:36.737 --> 00:14:39.418]  It's very bad to have the military involved in politics.
[00:14:39.598 --> 00:14:42.979]  That's police state, and Bush is trying to stop that.
[00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:46.040]  We have a law against that, posse comitatus.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:54.743]  No, the law isn't that once generals are out of the military that they're not allowed to have their own political view, especially on something that they're experts on.
[00:14:56.468 --> 00:15:16.234]  No, Bush is doing the opposite, putting troops on the streets, brainwashing children at public schools across the country, having urban warfare drills, saying he wants to get rid of posse commentatus, and that martial law might be needed if bird flu breaks out, or one more terror attack and they'll set aside the Constitution in favor of a military form of government.
[00:15:16.554 --> 00:15:17.314]  And who said that?
[00:15:18.223 --> 00:15:27.827]  Outgoing head of CENTCOM said that two years ago, Tommy Frankson, it turned out he was on secret White House $455,000 a year payola.
[00:15:29.027 --> 00:15:34.970]  And the Governmental Accounting Office said that was illegal, along with the thousands of other people they've got on secret payroll.
[00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.671]  And when Bush got caught, he said, I don't care if the law says I can't do it.
[00:15:39.091 --> 00:15:40.092]  I'm the decider.
[00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:41.412]  I'm above the law.
[00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:44.033]  Get a view from my Attorney General.
[00:15:44.534 --> 00:15:46.474]  His Attorney General, of course he's allowed to do this.
[00:15:46.534 --> 00:15:47.815]  We're in a war on terror.
[00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:51.560]  And that war on terror means brainwashing you.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.842]  Now, TooStupidToBePresident.com had this out about a year ago.
[00:15:55.782 --> 00:15:57.163]  And I never played it, and I meant to.
[00:15:57.603 --> 00:16:00.504]  Then Paul reposted it on PrisonPlanet.com, so it reminded me to.
[00:16:01.165 --> 00:16:12.750]  And it starts out with Rumsfeld, it's a cartoon, up there literally with real quotes he gave in the past, because at the end they show those quotes.
[00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:15.349]  That's what twostupidwouldbepresident.com does.
[00:16:15.369 --> 00:16:17.710]  There's an incredibly talented animator there.
[00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.011]  One guy does it all.
[00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:20.212]  The music, the voices, everything.
[00:16:20.993 --> 00:16:21.854]  I'm just a big fan.
[00:16:22.855 --> 00:16:31.621]  And at the end of it, they again show the quotes, but it starts out with Rumsfeld as a cartoon character, like the beginning of every Seinfeld episode, doing some stand-up comedy.
[00:16:31.862 --> 00:16:35.384]  Then it cuts to Rumsfeld in the Oval Office with the cartoon Bush.
[00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:37.186]  So go ahead and roll that.
[00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:44.178]  Was I really expected to adhere to them?
[00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:45.619]  You tell me.
[00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:48.060]  Are they called the Geneva Laws?
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.961]  The Geneva Rules?
[00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:53.042]  Or merely the Geneva Convention?
[00:16:54.583 --> 00:16:58.084]  To me, that sounds more like a set of polite suggestions.
[00:17:00.985 --> 00:17:05.167]  Now that I've briefed you on the unforgivable conditions at Abu Ghraib,
[00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:07.276]  I offer my resignation.
[00:17:12.378 --> 00:17:13.518]  This really takes me back.
[00:17:14.058 --> 00:17:18.800]  To the rape rooms of the Texas penal system when you were governor?
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.841]  Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:27.022]  Uh, how as a child you used to put M80s in the mouths of frogs.
[00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:32.586]  Then throw the creatures in the air to watch them explode, you little Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:17:32.686 --> 00:17:34.747]  Good catch, but that wasn't it either.
[00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:43.088]  Do the stress position, sleep deprivation, and branding you enacted as part of your fraternity initiation, BULL?
[00:17:43.248 --> 00:17:43.708]  That's it.
[00:17:43.868 --> 00:17:47.169]  We made 40 pledges sit with their heads between their legs all night.
[00:17:47.829 --> 00:17:50.670]  If they so much as coughed, we'd kick them or tan them with paddles.
[00:17:51.368 --> 00:17:55.070]  Finally, in the morning, we bring out this big old glowing branding iron.
[00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.132]  Of course, when the story hit the old daily news, we got fined and had to stop.
[00:17:59.852 --> 00:18:01.333]  Oh, do I just have to get out?
[00:18:02.613 --> 00:18:06.815]  We could sit on the story for a few months and see if it blows over.
[00:18:07.716 --> 00:18:10.897]  Sort of the Republican version of don't ask, don't tell.
[00:18:12.678 --> 00:18:13.879]  I'd hate to ruin all the fun.
[00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.640]  You said you had something for me?
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.922]  Oh, as a matter of fact, I do.
[00:18:20.822 --> 00:18:24.425]  This snuff video from one of our other interrogation centers.
[00:18:24.926 --> 00:18:25.766]  Oh man!
[00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:28.769]  You are the best Secretary of Defense ever!
[00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:34.874]  You're doing a superb job.
[00:18:36.576 --> 00:18:39.559]  You are a strong Secretary of Defense.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.101]  Then they have the quotes.
[00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.874]  So many of the things you heard there were actual quotes, and the snuff film stuff goes on too.
[00:18:46.894 --> 00:18:49.597]  I mean, the fellow's not joking around dealing with that.
[00:18:49.617 --> 00:19:02.411]  These are SICOs, as many different former government high-level experts and the CIA generals have said here as the former founding commander of Delta Force.
[00:19:03.732 --> 00:19:15.298]  Who is the advisor on the big CBS show, The Unit, has gone public in LA Weekly and on national television saying that torture is directly ordered by Cheney and that he actually enjoys it.
[00:19:16.718 --> 00:19:25.382]  And then it was admitted that hundreds of videos and thousands of photos were quote delivered to the White House of the torture and killing to be reviewed.
[00:19:25.402 --> 00:19:27.984]  It was also showed to select members of Congress.
[00:19:29.344 --> 00:19:32.566]  And it is literally hundreds of times worse than what you've seen.
[00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.932]  And, I mean, I get sick of even listening what is admitted in there.
[00:19:38.992 --> 00:19:41.173]  Remember John Yoo, just a few months ago, the CFR meeting?
[00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:41.714]  It got recorded.
[00:19:41.734 --> 00:19:42.914]  We had a professor on that debated him.
[00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:45.215]  CFR meeting in Chicago.
[00:19:45.235 --> 00:19:48.737]  He said, yeah, we can torture small children in front of their parents sexually.
[00:19:50.358 --> 00:19:51.258]  Just out in the open.
[00:19:51.278 --> 00:19:53.279]  Yep, yep, we torture children sexually.
[00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:54.280]  We're your government.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.261]  Now, shut up and let us run everything.
[00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:06.066]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:20:06.346 --> 00:20:09.907]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:20:10.067 --> 00:20:18.190]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:24.092]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:20:24.392 --> 00:20:29.614]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:20:29.894 --> 00:20:31.975]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:20:32.235 --> 00:20:44.379]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:49.043]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:20:49.264 --> 00:20:50.204]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:20:50.405 --> 00:20:52.026]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:20:52.146 --> 00:20:53.948]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:54.669]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:54.889]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:04.581]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.981 --> 00:21:10.468]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:11.530]  That's right.
[00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.133]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:14.453 --> 00:21:21.623]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:22.176 --> 00:21:29.880]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.182]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.802 --> 00:21:38.804]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.605 --> 00:21:45.727]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:46.347]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:48.308]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:48.368 --> 00:21:48.688]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.968 --> 00:21:49.249]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:05.428]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:22:05.788 --> 00:22:14.592]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:19.615]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:26.797]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:22:27.197 --> 00:22:38.981]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:43.904]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:22:44.084 --> 00:22:48.667]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:52.189]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:52.289 --> 00:22:55.311]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:58.573]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:58.693 --> 00:22:59.854]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:05.798]  If you had to flee your home in three minutes, what would you bring?
[00:23:06.775 --> 00:23:13.503]  Wouldn't it be nice if you had all of your important items in one place and ready to grab just in case you had to leave quickly in an emergency?
[00:23:16.836 --> 00:23:22.080]  Guardian Angel Preparedness specializes in survival products and 72-hour survival kits.
[00:23:22.521 --> 00:23:28.785]  Our kits contain only the finest quality survival supplies, hand-selected to be of real value in an emergency.
[00:23:29.186 --> 00:23:32.128]  We have kits for one, two, four people or more.
[00:23:32.588 --> 00:23:39.654]  We also carry emergency lighting, tools, and even survival supplies for your dog, like saddlebags and collapsible food and water bowls.

[00:23:41.835 --> 00:23:42.095]  That's 877-442-7548.
[00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:43.255]  Or visit www.gapkits.com.
[00:23:43.275 --> 00:23:44.355]  That's www.gapkits.com.
[00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:47.196]  Remember, it wasn't raining when Noah built the ark.
[00:24:02.755 --> 00:24:07.897]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.577 --> 00:24:10.878]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:29.377 --> 00:24:32.598]  I will be going to your phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:34.458 --> 00:24:47.881]  But I never get over the fact that our media has gone from criticizing China over half of the reports they put out in decades past that I witnessed on television were negative.
[00:24:48.641 --> 00:24:53.222]  Now maybe 5% of the reporting is negative and China is worse than ever.
[00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.952]  In their abuse, all the human rights groups that analyze the cases admit.
[00:25:00.193 --> 00:25:08.417]  But suddenly our media many times is positive concerning some of the Tiananmen Square type activities that are going on a monthly basis there that we know about.
[00:25:09.657 --> 00:25:16.521]  Not to mention the mobile execution vans and the organ harvesting and the land grabbing, all of it.
[00:25:18.342 --> 00:25:23.404]  And then we have an Attorney General that says they can torture people to death and that it's not torture because they say it isn't.
[00:25:24.548 --> 00:25:27.570]  They've changed the name, so that supposedly changed the action.
[00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:41.981]  And we have his deputy coming out and saying they can torture children in front of their parents and then adding deviant sickness on top of it as if torturing children isn't bad enough and isn't deviant and sick enough.
[00:25:42.001 --> 00:25:50.127]  I mean, we're all having our psyches driven through the pit of hell for some future horror that's going to dwarf all of those.
[00:25:52.344 --> 00:25:55.566]  And it really is a deal with the devil the American people are being given.
[00:25:56.147 --> 00:26:00.670]  And of course, even when you make a deal with the devil, he always brings you down in the end.
[00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.772]  Look at Faust and his Faustian bargain.
[00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:16.181]  I mean, look at our dollar, look at our oil prices, look at our educational levels, look at the family statistics, marriage, broken marriages, drug use, every indicator, IQs,
[00:26:17.501 --> 00:26:20.082]  Cancer, diabetes, sperm counts.
[00:26:20.102 --> 00:26:21.242]  I mean, we're being cursed.
[00:26:21.302 --> 00:26:22.902]  We are a cursed people.
[00:26:22.942 --> 00:26:26.683]  We've gone from the most blessed, the most opulently successful.
[00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:30.724]  I mean, I heard some spin today out of investors' business.
[00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:41.207]  I heard a neo come on the radio going, look, we've gone from 800 people in America worth more than $5 million to 900 and something in the last year.
[00:26:42.854 --> 00:26:43.634]  Oh, look!
[00:26:44.094 --> 00:26:46.895]  We've gone from this many billionaires to that many billionaires.
[00:26:46.975 --> 00:26:47.535]  It's grown by 8%.
[00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:52.676]  Well, that's no benchmark of a successful society.
[00:26:52.716 --> 00:27:02.338]  I mean, Mexico produces more billionaires and millionaires than any other country, even countries that are much larger, even more than China, just because the communist Chinese leaders are good at hiding it.
[00:27:04.058 --> 00:27:06.379]  But the dollar has been devalued by 44%
[00:27:09.887 --> 00:27:20.131]  And so, of course, with the printing presses of the Federal Reserve on overdrive, admittedly, you're going to see increases in certain sectors of wealth.
[00:27:20.211 --> 00:27:27.174]  But if you look at overall indices, we are at a higher level of debt per capita.
[00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:29.015]  We are a debtor nation per capita.
[00:27:29.055 --> 00:27:29.996]  That's private.
[00:27:30.016 --> 00:27:31.816]  I'm talking about state, federal, or local.
[00:27:33.297 --> 00:27:34.398]  I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:27:34.418 --> 00:27:35.438]  These are just the real numbers.
[00:27:35.478 --> 00:27:37.319]  We have a lower debt ratio
[00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:43.840]  Versus savings ratio, a negative ratio than we had at the depth of the depression in late 1933.
[00:27:44.601 --> 00:27:47.622]  We broke that record a few months ago and plunging steadily downward.
[00:27:48.643 --> 00:27:51.704]  And people are paying off credit cards with other credit cards.
[00:27:51.724 --> 00:27:53.205]  And then we hear all these financial shows.
[00:27:53.365 --> 00:27:53.485]  Oh!
[00:27:53.986 --> 00:27:55.847]  Are the credit card companies going to get scammed?
[00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:56.307]  No!
[00:27:57.087 --> 00:27:58.908]  They're using fractional reserve banking.
[00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:00.669]  They're loaning out zeros and ones.
[00:28:00.729 --> 00:28:02.230]  It's just all in computer systems.
[00:28:03.711 --> 00:28:05.152]  It's all a Ponzi scheme.
[00:28:05.192 --> 00:28:07.093]  The globalists want everyone in debt.
[00:28:08.001 --> 00:28:11.483]  So overall, standard of living is going down versus inflation.
[00:28:11.943 --> 00:28:13.664]  Overall, debts are going up.
[00:28:13.824 --> 00:28:23.808]  Overall, every indicator of a society, educational level, test scores, factories, jobs, it's all going in the wrong direction, but it doesn't matter.
[00:28:24.168 --> 00:28:36.794]  You've got these delusional yuppies driving around, most of them living in debt, posing, trying to keep up appearances, the British term, trying to pose as if they're affluent, nouveau riche, and they're not.
[00:28:39.278 --> 00:28:47.826]  In fact, we have seen the real estate bubble begin to bust, which I think is a shame, because even though the real estate is vastly overvalued, it doesn't matter.
[00:28:47.866 --> 00:28:56.554]  At least with those fiat dollars, as they devalue, you can still buy something real that has some base value to it in the final equation.
[00:28:57.755 --> 00:28:58.255]  Gold!
[00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:01.999]  I remember buying a couple coins here, a couple coins there every few months.
[00:29:03.772 --> 00:29:15.278]  And over the years, buying at $200 an ounce, $230 an ounce, $250, $300, $350, and yes, we just tell Midas, I've been so busy the last three days, you're holding that gold for me, I'm going to buy a few more coins.
[00:29:16.078 --> 00:29:16.819]  Yeah, I'm going to buy them.
[00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:21.861]  I held them last week back at $595 an ounce, and I'm buying some bullion.
[00:29:21.881 --> 00:29:24.983]  I've got it held, it's already what, at $640?
[00:29:25.323 --> 00:29:28.725]  And am I selling my gold?
[00:29:29.445 --> 00:29:31.306]  Now that the gold I've got has gone up?
[00:29:32.246 --> 00:29:33.327]  More than doubled in value?
[00:29:34.543 --> 00:29:35.823]  I don't see the stock market doing that.
[00:29:36.803 --> 00:29:40.104]  No, I'm not dumping it, because it's an insurance policy.
[00:29:41.224 --> 00:29:43.985]  Okay, I'll come back, take your calls, and a whole bunch of news.
[00:29:44.385 --> 00:29:47.486]  Got some more clips for you too, and two powerful guests coming up as well.
[00:29:52.087 --> 00:29:53.007]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.487 --> 00:29:55.087]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.007 --> 00:29:58.708]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:07.750]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.312]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:30:10.552 --> 00:30:13.853]  That's why you need SFR's Protect-A Synthetic Oil Treatments.
[00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:18.816]  Protect-A Engine Treatment, Protect-A Transmission Treatment, and Protect-A Complete Fuel System Treatment.

[00:31:14.827 --> 00:31:18.310]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.792]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:23.073 --> 00:31:27.015]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:27.235 --> 00:31:33.759]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:39.462]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.143]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[00:32:16.243 --> 00:32:21.368]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.

[00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:44.481]  I think so.
[00:33:11.826 --> 00:33:13.707]  Iran says they're not scared of the U.S.
[00:33:13.747 --> 00:33:15.948]  That's what their defense minister stated.
[00:33:15.968 --> 00:33:25.655]  A communist Chinese agent caught trying to ship in 200 shoulder-fired rockets that can easily shoot down aircraft at thousands of feet.
[00:33:27.396 --> 00:33:28.636]  And of course it's connected to
[00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:35.236]  The Communist Chinese military, our friends, have been caught trying to ship in these weapons before.
[00:33:35.356 --> 00:33:36.037]  But that's okay.
[00:33:36.077 --> 00:33:38.358]  I'm sure it's some deal with our government to pull something later.
[00:33:38.378 --> 00:33:44.021]  Then they'll just take all our freedoms and grab all our pension funds and rob everyone like they're already doing, but just accelerate it.
[00:33:44.502 --> 00:33:45.442]  Ordered out of chaos.
[00:33:45.462 --> 00:33:51.886]  The worse the chaos gets, the more bedlam there is, the more control these people get over our lives.
[00:33:51.906 --> 00:33:55.508]  And then they finance the takeover of our lives with their own money and pay it themselves.
[00:33:56.221 --> 00:34:00.124]  I'm going to go through your calls fast, because I've got a bunch of news I want to cover, but I do want to take your calls.
[00:34:00.184 --> 00:34:02.966]  John, Jeff, Jim, Ron, Mike, get ready, because I'm going to you quick.
[00:34:03.526 --> 00:34:04.827]  John and Matt, you're on the air.
[00:34:05.688 --> 00:34:06.769]  Hi Alex, how are you today?
[00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.389]  Good, sir.
[00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:08.270]  Good.
[00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.712]  I just wanted to give you a little update out here in Massachusetts.
[00:34:12.453 --> 00:34:23.601]  Today I found out, as I went in for my office meeting, because I am a realtor, that we were talking about one of Romney's plans to fingerprint realtors.
[00:34:25.751 --> 00:34:31.194]  Which means, because I don't want to be registered with the government as having my fingerprints, I'm going to need to find a new job now.
[00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.595]  Yes, sir, that's Homeland Security.
[00:34:32.635 --> 00:34:52.348]  Again, I'm sure you've heard me many times talk about a two-hour meeting I saw almost four years ago with the former Homeland Security head, Governor Ridge, on C-SPAN, and they said, our national ID card to the driver's license, we'll have to have it to get into any job, we'll scan in to go to work, we'll have a national sales tax known as the fair tax, they're going to keep the income tax on top of it, isn't this what the neocons aren't?
[00:34:52.788 --> 00:34:58.591]  Telling you, and everyone's going to have to thumb scan and biometrically every day to get into work.
[00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:01.052]  The cars will have this on them.
[00:35:01.072 --> 00:35:02.733]  Toyota is now announcing it and others.
[00:35:03.154 --> 00:35:04.454]  It is a nightmare system.
[00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:16.200]  It absolutely is and it looks like they're really starting to implement it because as I recall when I took my real estate license a few years ago, the test for it, they did take certain people's fingerprints.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:18.461]  They thumb scanned them to get your results.
[00:35:18.622 --> 00:35:19.342]  That's how they did it.
[00:35:20.129 --> 00:35:23.410]  Yeah, nobody asked you, and there's no law at that point.
[00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.511]  Here, just come over here and do this.
[00:35:25.971 --> 00:35:35.094]  And now it's going in the schools, it's going in the colleges, it's going in the businesses, the HEB grocery stores, the Safeways, for the employees, and at some test facilities.
[00:35:35.715 --> 00:35:39.036]  When you do the self-checkout, it's an added security feature for you.
[00:35:39.456 --> 00:35:42.317]  And of course, it's the very thing that most states already implemented.
[00:35:42.357 --> 00:35:45.138]  Now by federal law, all are implementing biometrics.
[00:35:45.839 --> 00:35:50.924]  Yeah, they have that here too in a lot of the supermarkets and even at the Home Depot, Lowe's Home Improvement stores.
[00:35:51.665 --> 00:35:59.051]  And what I don't get is, they can tell, the computers can scan to see if whether or not you've checked something out before you actually check it out.
[00:35:59.232 --> 00:36:00.653]  So that was a little frightening to me.
[00:36:00.713 --> 00:36:05.578]  I mean... Yeah, it knows your algorithm, your history.
[00:36:05.618 --> 00:36:05.858]  Listen,
[00:36:06.528 --> 00:36:10.010]  If just a few hundred people sue over this and say no, they won't be able to implement.
[00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.213]  We've already held back implementation of RFID over a year and a half.
[00:36:14.913 --> 00:36:16.074]  They're really getting angry.
[00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.915]  At every front, we can say no to this.
[00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:20.256]  Toll roads, all of it.
[00:36:20.276 --> 00:36:22.538]  We just have to continue to say no, no, no.
[00:36:23.438 --> 00:36:24.319]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:36:24.379 --> 00:36:29.822]  And if I could just speak to what you were saying a little earlier about the system and how it's going to be run.
[00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:32.971]  Almost like a mafia system.
[00:36:33.231 --> 00:36:34.652]  Well, everything's going to be a prison.
[00:36:35.012 --> 00:36:37.672]  America itself is going to be a prison.
[00:36:37.712 --> 00:36:38.673]  It's almost there.
[00:36:39.593 --> 00:36:39.853]  It is.
[00:36:40.893 --> 00:36:47.294]  Maybe your listeners have never heard of the Winter Hill section of Boston, where the Winter Hill Gang ran.
[00:36:47.634 --> 00:36:50.955]  Whitey Bulger did hits with the FBI.
[00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:51.995]  Sure, yeah.
[00:36:52.835 --> 00:36:57.016]  I grew up there, and I remember what it was like when the cops were paid off.
[00:36:58.615 --> 00:36:59.255]  By these guys.
[00:36:59.355 --> 00:37:00.996]  When people were afraid to go to the store.
[00:37:01.677 --> 00:37:04.458]  And I'm not scared anymore.
[00:37:04.558 --> 00:37:06.740]  I'm angry because I don't ever want to see that come back.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.502]  And to have it done by the government means to protect my family.
[00:37:10.882 --> 00:37:13.084]  Death is not an option.
[00:37:13.404 --> 00:37:14.605]  I'll gladly die for this.
[00:37:14.865 --> 00:37:15.826]  Yeah, you're sick of it.
[00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:18.007]  We're not going to be ruled by a bunch of crooks.
[00:37:18.047 --> 00:37:18.787]  Thanks for the call.
[00:37:18.807 --> 00:37:21.029]  I mean, it's despicable.
[00:37:22.071 --> 00:37:29.574]  And there's certain regions of the country that have been known throughout our entire 230-something year history where government corruption was never put up with.
[00:37:29.594 --> 00:37:39.438]  And there's other areas like Boston, New York, Chicago, LA, where for some reason, I'm not saying the whole population, but generally the population is known for laying down.
[00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:49.743]  In areas of the South and the West, where just a few times citizens revolted, and they called them, you know, sagebrush rebellions,
[00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.913]  Wildfire rebellions, people backed off and learned who the boss was.
[00:37:54.473 --> 00:37:56.875]  Look, if you act like slaves, you're going to be a slave.
[00:37:57.836 --> 00:38:05.022]  If you're not a man... Look, I'm not a tough guy, folks, but I've found in life it's just better to just go ahead and bring it on.
[00:38:05.582 --> 00:38:14.549]  If somebody's going to try to push you around, if somebody's going to try to enslave you, if somebody's going to try to boss you around, I don't care how fancy their PR is, it's slavery, it's a fraud.
[00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.711]  Jeff in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:38:17.563 --> 00:38:21.386]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to make a couple of comments about some of the things you were saying.
[00:38:22.187 --> 00:38:27.992]  One of the things was about Dum Dum Rumsfeld and how President Bush said he was doing such a fine job.
[00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:35.019]  Well, you know, he said the same thing about the FEMA director, former FEMA director.
[00:38:35.039 --> 00:38:36.440]  Yeah, Brownie's doing a great job.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.602]  Yeah, he said Michael Brown was doing a great job.
[00:38:39.326 --> 00:38:41.747]  And of course, he got ousted a short time later.
[00:38:41.927 --> 00:38:43.147]  By the way, this isn't a joke.
[00:38:43.247 --> 00:38:44.868]  Everyone has a poo-poo name.
[00:38:45.608 --> 00:38:47.028]  Bill Vies is a good psychologist.
[00:38:47.048 --> 00:38:50.289]  We'll ask him what that means in Bush's psychology.
[00:38:50.709 --> 00:38:52.470]  But everybody has a poo-poo name.
[00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.511]  Turd Blossom, Brownie, Pooper, Turdy.
[00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:58.671]  I mean, Bush is a mentally ill sicko.
[00:38:58.971 --> 00:39:04.893]  Oh yeah, he even said, and you can even play the tape back, and he said, I hear the voices.
[00:39:05.613 --> 00:39:08.714]  And whatever he meant by that, but in any event,
[00:39:09.436 --> 00:39:38.410]  You know, a lot of stuff is going on, Alex, and you know, this is a good example of how President Bush lies to the American people, and one of the other things I wanted to point out is something related to global warming, and there's these NASA scientists who help write a report to Congress called, Our Changing Planet, then they send a draft to the White House, and what the Bush administration does, his Chief of Staff, Phil Cooney, they edit the report and actually delete a bunch of stuff out of it,
[00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:56.620]  And then Bush goes into the Rose Garden and he, of course, after they bog up this report to Congress, which they're not supposed to do, and of course he goes on national TV in the Rose Garden and basically false statements to the American people.
[00:39:57.201 --> 00:40:02.124]  And he, you know, pretty much out and out lying to the American people.
[00:40:02.164 --> 00:40:03.285]  That's what he does routinely.
[00:40:03.325 --> 00:40:03.966]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:06.741 --> 00:40:10.144]  I don't believe in global warming because of the science.
[00:40:10.244 --> 00:40:12.166]  I believe in global climate change.
[00:40:12.226 --> 00:40:14.187]  Some areas are getting colder, some are getting hotter.
[00:40:14.768 --> 00:40:22.014]  The sun went through its heaviest 11 and a half year cycle, if you want to get precise about it, over the last decade.
[00:40:22.455 --> 00:40:27.359]  They thought it would go into a light cycle for the next 11 years instead.
[00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:49.763]  Preliminary data from NASA and other observatories, private and public, around the world show that it's heating up to be 50% brighter, with a 50% or higher, they're saying, radiated increase of the radiation, the heat radiation, the gamma rays, all the different types of radiation that actually fuel the earth and heat the earth and run the earth.
[00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:51.323]  We already went over this last week.
[00:40:51.443 --> 00:40:52.544]  You look at volcanoes.
[00:40:53.647 --> 00:41:01.409]  One major gas volcano explosion, not a lava flow volcano, but a major gas explosion volcano like Mount St.
[00:41:01.429 --> 00:41:11.732]  Helens, which they have on average every two years, puts out more fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions than all human activity in the last thousand years.
[00:41:12.292 --> 00:41:17.834]  That's all the campfires, all the coal burning stoves, all the industries, all the cars for a thousand years.
[00:41:18.695 --> 00:41:19.976]  It isn't a hundred like you've heard.
[00:41:20.016 --> 00:41:22.457]  You go look at the actual numbers, it's really over a thousand.
[00:41:22.877 --> 00:41:28.419]  They've done the ice core test in Antarctica and in the North Pole, and the Earth goes through these cycles.
[00:41:28.499 --> 00:41:29.700]  We're on a 12,000 year cycle.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.221]  The sun's on an 11 and a half year cycle.
[00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:39.264]  And so what they do is they globally stampede and say, we need a global tax on oil and on the industrialized nations.
[00:41:39.324 --> 00:41:41.505]  And 167 third world countries are exempt.
[00:41:41.525 --> 00:41:45.527]  That'll just ensure that any jobs that hadn't shifted overseas will finally leave.
[00:41:45.867 --> 00:41:48.088]  The 20-something percent that haven't left that are industrial.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.941]  And it's just all a scam.
[00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:54.625]  It's stampeding us with, if you don't do what the government witch doctors say, the sun won't come up in the morning.
[00:41:55.425 --> 00:41:56.686]  Let's talk to Jim in Texas.
[00:41:56.706 --> 00:41:57.387]  Jim, go ahead.
[00:41:57.407 --> 00:41:58.728]  Hey Alex.
[00:41:59.468 --> 00:42:14.460]  Alex, I believe ICE conducted that sweep through Dallas last night, not because they wanted to enforce the law, but they didn't want real Americans to follow the example of the criminal illegals from Mexico and riot in the streets, or march to the Capitol.
[00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:15.261]  You know,
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:21.542]  They want to curb this insurrection before real Americans begin to realize that we can do it too.
[00:42:22.823 --> 00:42:43.851]  And not only that, but this Reconquista thing that they're pushing, that's a property rights issue every bit as much as that Kelo versus Connecticut where they distorted the eminent domain from private to public into private to private, whereby they're taking their land, our government,
[00:42:44.398 --> 00:42:47.159]  And given to the favored groups because they can.
[00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:51.561]  And we're not going into the streets protesting that when we should have.
[00:42:52.161 --> 00:43:05.886]  The morning after that Kelo versus Connecticut decision, when they declared that we don't have the right to life, liberty, or property, that we should have been in the streets in numbers a thousand times greater than the Mexicans have mustered.
[00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:11.829]  And because they're beginning to fear that we'll do that, they cracked down on
[00:43:13.345 --> 00:43:15.505]  The Mexican invaders last night... I agree.
[00:43:15.525 --> 00:43:16.506]  ...gave Bill a little fear.
[00:43:16.706 --> 00:43:18.466]  Jim, Jim, I totally agree with you.
[00:43:18.486 --> 00:43:20.186]  Let me, in fact, I have a whole stack of news on that.
[00:43:20.206 --> 00:43:21.726]  I want to comment on that in this hour.
[00:43:21.746 --> 00:43:23.887]  So let me comment on that and we'll go back to the calls.
[00:43:24.347 --> 00:43:26.507]  Well, thanks for having Bill Beef on also.
[00:43:26.867 --> 00:43:28.568]  He's another Austinite with a brain.
[00:43:28.588 --> 00:43:32.308]  And as you know, Austin's overflowing with talent.
[00:43:33.148 --> 00:43:36.209]  I believe it's probably the epicenter of the revolt that's coming.
[00:43:36.929 --> 00:43:37.449]  I agree with you.
[00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:38.149]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:41.970]  And everyone else agrees with that and that's why there's so many people moving here.
[00:43:42.876 --> 00:43:47.599]  Who are in the movement, which at certain points is okay, at other levels it gets a little bit annoying.
[00:43:48.119 --> 00:43:52.502]  But let me just try to comment on what you just brought up.
[00:43:53.783 --> 00:43:55.404]  There are 20 million illegal Mexicans.
[00:43:55.424 --> 00:43:57.606]  There are 5 million other illegals, conservatively.
[00:43:57.826 --> 00:43:59.687]  That's the real numbers, not 14, not 20.
[00:44:00.147 --> 00:44:08.933]  It's 25 million illegal aliens, Russians, Chinese, Latin Americans, Central Asians, Arabs, make up the 5 million Africans.
[00:44:09.453 --> 00:44:10.514]  They make up 5 million.
[00:44:11.275 --> 00:44:12.216]  And growing, by the way.
[00:44:12.296 --> 00:44:15.257]  It's now starting to outstrip, in the growth, the Larican Quista.
[00:44:15.277 --> 00:44:18.719]  Again, we're not talking about American Hispanics.
[00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:19.159]  We love them.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:25.103]  The major polls, again, 67 to 70 plus percent of Hispanics are against it.
[00:44:25.123 --> 00:44:32.427]  80 to 87 percent of Americans, when you average in Asians, Anglos, Hispanics, Blacks, it doesn't matter.
[00:44:33.347 --> 00:44:34.248]  Those are the big numbers.
[00:44:34.268 --> 00:44:36.629]  There's a whole bunch of polls, and they're all in those ranges.
[00:44:36.669 --> 00:44:37.549]  I don't just give you one poll.
[00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:38.330]  I give you the range.
[00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.811]  You can figure it out for yourself.
[00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:40.611]  It's somewhere in there.
[00:44:42.203 --> 00:44:43.304]  But you can just talk to your neighbors.
[00:44:43.364 --> 00:44:44.924]  This is the zeitgeist issue.
[00:44:44.944 --> 00:44:46.485]  This is what everybody wants to talk about.
[00:44:46.505 --> 00:44:48.365]  This is what almost every caller wants to talk about.
[00:44:48.805 --> 00:44:49.986]  It's what people are upset about.
[00:44:50.006 --> 00:44:55.468]  You hear our Hispanic callers agreeing with us from California and Texas and all over the world.
[00:44:55.608 --> 00:44:56.828]  They know what's going on.
[00:44:56.868 --> 00:44:59.189]  They understand it's to drive down wages and break up the U.S.
[00:44:59.569 --> 00:45:00.649]  with the Pan-American Union.
[00:45:00.709 --> 00:45:04.751]  Now, you got $25 million, and that's conservative.
[00:45:04.771 --> 00:45:05.271]  It's really over $30.
[00:45:06.824 --> 00:45:09.605]  My numbers are from government and private numbers.
[00:45:09.645 --> 00:45:10.906]  A couple years ago it was 30 million.
[00:45:10.926 --> 00:45:11.706]  It's now above that.
[00:45:12.926 --> 00:45:14.327]  But let's just say 25 million.
[00:45:15.607 --> 00:45:18.348]  And so ICE goes out and makes about a thousand arrests.
[00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:22.510]  And they say for a year they had told these companies 13 times
[00:45:23.982 --> 00:45:25.843]  That these are fake social security numbers.
[00:45:25.883 --> 00:45:27.283]  These aren't real social security numbers.
[00:45:27.604 --> 00:45:29.624]  These are social security numbers of dead people.
[00:45:30.025 --> 00:45:31.445]  You're not paying your taxes.
[00:45:31.465 --> 00:45:32.706]  A bunch of scams are going on.
[00:45:33.106 --> 00:45:36.207]  That's one reason that they're now saying that they weren't paying all their taxes.
[00:45:36.247 --> 00:45:37.088]  So, of course, they're mad.
[00:45:37.828 --> 00:45:39.569]  And that's what this guest worker program is.
[00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:40.869]  They're going to bring in unlimited.
[00:45:41.169 --> 00:45:43.130]  It's amnesty, but start taxing them.
[00:45:44.271 --> 00:45:46.291]  As if they'll ever even get near that social security.
[00:45:47.552 --> 00:45:48.872]  They are abusing these immigrants.
[00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:52.294]  I'm not against these hard-working Mexican immigrants.
[00:45:53.691 --> 00:46:03.960]  I've become against them once the Lovery Conquista, La Raza, Mexico, Oslon movements get them and they start running around with signs with white people's heads cut off openly saying we're going to kill you.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.961]  I mean, I've got it on tape.
[00:46:05.522 --> 00:46:07.183]  Then I go, hey man, come on.
[00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:08.925]  Listen, you're getting brainwashed.
[00:46:08.945 --> 00:46:10.386]  This is a Bush PR firm.
[00:46:10.406 --> 00:46:11.467]  Here's the Dallas Morning News.
[00:46:11.887 --> 00:46:14.490]  Because they know good PR is racial.
[00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.032]  Racial is very primitive, very tribal, very powerful.
[00:46:17.292 --> 00:46:19.354]  It's in all of us and it's really got to stop.
[00:46:21.514 --> 00:46:24.676]  So multiculturalism is really a governmental tool to get us all fighting with each other.
[00:46:24.756 --> 00:46:27.317]  It's to make us all see our differences and fight with each other.
[00:46:27.377 --> 00:46:28.538]  It's not for us all to get along.
[00:46:28.638 --> 00:46:29.318]  Understand that.
[00:46:30.479 --> 00:46:32.740]  You know, believe me now or believe me later, it's a fact.
[00:46:35.741 --> 00:46:38.523]  So 1,000... I don't have a calculator in front of me.
[00:46:38.543 --> 00:46:40.904]  Maybe I can do the math here just with a pen and paper.
[00:46:42.605 --> 00:46:44.425]  In fact, you've got a calculator there at your desk, don't you, Scott?
[00:46:44.485 --> 00:46:46.446]  What is 1,000 divided into 25 million?
[00:46:50.635 --> 00:46:52.116]  Do you have a calculator there?
[00:46:52.616 --> 00:46:55.238]  Okay, thank you, because it would be hard for me to talk and do that.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.160]  So what is a thousand?
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:15.292]  I mean, every month or so they'll have some bust where 15, 20, 30 people at some golf course or some hotel get grabbed or they'll go charge people every few months, say in Baltimore, for the whole restaurant staff being illegal aliens from Mexico.
[00:47:16.573 --> 00:47:18.975]  And by the way, I was talking to a chef when I was out in California
[00:47:19.904 --> 00:47:49.347]  and uh... he was uh... he was talking about how well how it is you know they'll be russian chefs at one place and they'll only hire russians or mainly mexicans and they only hire mexicans and then basically uh... you get told by the white owners or black owners or hispanic owners sorry they can't talk to you anymore you don't have your job and these are degreed chefs that basically it's just like outsourcing computer jobs to india you train someone to replace you and then sorry this this
[00:47:50.299 --> 00:47:52.242]  Kitchen is a Russian kitchen.
[00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:54.386]  This kitchen is a Middle Eastern kitchen.
[00:47:54.426 --> 00:47:56.229]  This kitchen is a Mexican kitchen.
[00:47:57.571 --> 00:47:58.933]  And I've talked to a lot of people.
[00:47:58.973 --> 00:47:59.854]  People in factories.
[00:47:59.894 --> 00:48:00.716]  People in businesses.
[00:48:01.428 --> 00:48:06.531]  I mean, it's getting so bad that the English speakers are literally being kicked out.
[00:48:06.591 --> 00:48:07.512]  I mean, it's really going on.
[00:48:07.812 --> 00:48:11.554]  In fact, they've called for, don't buy from the gringo, don't support the gringo day.
[00:48:11.754 --> 00:48:12.895]  That's what it's called on their websites.
[00:48:13.115 --> 00:48:17.158]  You hear on Time Magazine, you know, the boycott day or the protest day.
[00:48:17.198 --> 00:48:21.180]  No, man, it's hurt the gringo, don't let the gringo know.
[00:48:22.041 --> 00:48:23.141]  This is unacceptable.
[00:48:24.542 --> 00:48:30.366]  You know, I go out and protest the Klan, I've done it over ten times, and I'll protest Mecha, La Raza, and the Reconquistas all day long, because I
[00:48:31.357 --> 00:48:32.978]  I'm the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.802]  And that's just how I am, that's what I do.
[00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:38.743]  I just tell it like it is.
[00:48:39.604 --> 00:48:46.109]  And so I get threats from the Klan, and I get threats from Larrick and Keistis, and I just don't care, you're all a bunch of scum in my boat.
[00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:51.954]  And so, a thousand into twenty-five million.
[00:48:55.417 --> 00:48:59.300]  Point zero, zero, zero, zero, four.
[00:49:00.868 --> 00:49:12.555]  So, that's how many of the illegals they grabbed yesterday in this big, multi-state, five-state, one-thousand people arrested and their employers arrested.
[00:49:12.935 --> 00:49:16.798]  Because they know it's... Listen, they did their PR thing and it's a bell they can't unring.
[00:49:17.118 --> 00:49:23.622]  Everybody for the first week saw the Mexican flags and the pictures of whites' heads chopped off and the, this is our continent, blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:33.644]  And then the big UT Chicano study professor at Dallas, or at Arlington, I always just say Dallas, Metroplex, came out and said, we've got to kill all the gringos, it's a quote.
[00:49:34.184 --> 00:49:38.425]  Used to, he just said, implement the plan of San Diego, kill all white males, 16 and older.
[00:49:38.805 --> 00:49:44.686]  So when my son turns 16, he'll have to, I guess, go kneel, and he'll get a big sword, and, DIE DEVIL WHITE!
[00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:49.467]  I mean, I guess I need to go ahead and report for, you know, to be killed.
[00:49:50.063 --> 00:49:52.084]  I'm supposed to go, oh, you're so sweet.
[00:49:52.784 --> 00:49:54.304]  Oh, don't be mean to me.
[00:49:54.324 --> 00:49:57.725]  Oh, you're racist and not want the plan of San Diego.
[00:49:57.745 --> 00:50:04.927]  I mean, I had the Texas Civil Rights Review go, well, the plan of San Diego was real, but these are downtrodden groups, and Alex is bad.
[00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:05.427]  Talk about it.
[00:50:08.388 --> 00:50:09.969]  Meanwhile, here are the headlines.
[00:50:10.049 --> 00:50:12.149]  Turnt up, down place Mexican military incursions.
[00:50:12.189 --> 00:50:15.610]  Homeland Security Chief insists reports of past 10 years overblown.
[00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:18.111]  Yeah, cops being killed, informants being killed.
[00:50:19.005 --> 00:50:26.131]  DEA, FBI, every few months, mass kidnappings, 800 deaths last year alone, plus 800 and something on the Texas border.
[00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:30.934]  And here's another one, Minuteman to Bush, build a fence or we will.
[00:50:32.716 --> 00:50:33.376]  Bravo!
[00:50:35.218 --> 00:50:41.483]  So, I mean, we've got a group of people running around doing all this, declaring this is Mexico,
[00:50:42.336 --> 00:50:47.341]  And then the government, because everything's blowing up in their face, thank God, goes out and busts a thousand people.
[00:50:47.721 --> 00:50:54.507]  If I see a thousand busted a day, for a year, I will say bravo and the government's turn the corner.
[00:50:54.947 --> 00:50:56.228]  It ain't gonna happen, okay?
[00:50:56.268 --> 00:50:57.469]  You'll get one of these a year.
[00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.411]  I want one every day.
[00:50:59.792 --> 00:51:01.053]  That would be scratching.
[00:51:03.024 --> 00:51:05.886]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:07.708]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:08.068 --> 00:51:12.731]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:13.072 --> 00:51:19.817]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.137 --> 00:51:22.118]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.318 --> 00:51:25.178]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.258 --> 00:51:29.920]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.521]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:42.003]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.243 --> 00:51:44.643]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:02.136 --> 00:52:08.380]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:14.684]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:14.964 --> 00:52:23.389]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:30.674]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:30.974 --> 00:52:35.797]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:35.997 --> 00:52:41.381]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:41.761 --> 00:52:44.823]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:45.164 --> 00:52:53.129]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:53.749]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.636 --> 00:53:03.977]  I think so.
[00:53:18.869 --> 00:53:19.529]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.394 --> 00:53:51.477]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.657 --> 00:53:57.582]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:53:57.602 --> 00:54:14.316]  They railed against the crowd, another ragtag band.
[00:54:19.607 --> 00:54:36.038]  Bill Deese, a local Austin psychologist, patriot, known him for about, I should say Bill, ten years ago out of the Second Amendment rallies, because we're evil liberals, you know, pro-gun's liberal now, folks.
[00:54:36.358 --> 00:54:40.921]  Bush, as Bob Barr on the NRA board told us a few months ago, former congressman,
[00:54:41.707 --> 00:54:44.588]  George Bush is more anti-gun than Bill Clinton.
[00:54:44.608 --> 00:54:53.190]  But I know, I was at the gun shop a few weeks ago and they told me that it was all made up and I'm just lying, that George Bush is just absolutely wonderful.
[00:54:53.590 --> 00:55:06.413]  We're not going to be talking too much about the Second Amendment, we're going to be talking about the financial standing of this country and the agreements that have been made and the inflation of the money supply and foreign countries dumping the dollar, starting the dumping of the dollar
[00:55:07.299 --> 00:55:10.100]  That is coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.500]  Right now, let's go to Ron in New York.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:13.200]  Ron, go ahead.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:13.760]  You're on the air.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:14.620]  Hello, Alex.
[00:55:14.961 --> 00:55:18.801]  Alex, I'm calling up about two interviews that I heard on local New York radio this morning.
[00:55:18.861 --> 00:55:20.842]  Two separate subjects, but they were both shocking.
[00:55:21.442 --> 00:55:36.945]  One was with Chris Simcox of the Minutemen, and he said that he had inadvertently gotten swept up in traffic, and as a consequence of it, he had to enter Mexico, and he immediately turned around and did a U-turn to come back into the United States.
[00:55:37.739 --> 00:55:43.362]  When he did, he encountered American, American customs and authorities.
[00:55:44.202 --> 00:55:53.147]  And they actually gave him a hard time and asked this guy, I mean this man is clearly an American, a generational American, why he wanted to come into the United States.
[00:55:54.693 --> 00:55:55.994]  And they gave him a tough time of it.
[00:55:56.234 --> 00:56:18.182]  Sir, I mean, many times I've been down to Mexico, just in the last few years, and literally, people, you know, obvious people from the colonies, Southern Mexico, with little cowboy hats, and their families pour right in front of you, and then customs shakes you down because they think you might be carrying Rohypnol or steroids or Valium across.
[00:56:18.282 --> 00:56:19.483]  That's why they do it.
[00:56:19.663 --> 00:56:21.904]  They don't care about the illegal aliens.
[00:56:22.664 --> 00:56:28.986]  If that's their concern in search for drugs, why are you hassling an American citizen as to why he wants to come into the United States?
[00:56:29.066 --> 00:56:29.947]  That question was put to him.
[00:56:43.709 --> 00:56:48.470]  If you speak to him, I know that I believe you've spoken to members of that particular movement.
[00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:51.771]  I think he could probably... Yeah, we've had him on.
[00:56:52.372 --> 00:56:54.112]  We've had Mr. Simcox on many times.
[00:56:54.132 --> 00:56:57.493]  We have Al Garza with the Texas Minute Men in studio tomorrow.
[00:56:58.193 --> 00:57:07.016]  And in addition, on another issue, you remember the very famous incident of the American contract workers that were burnt and hung from a bridge in Fallujah?
[00:57:07.572 --> 00:57:08.392]  Yeah, Blackwater.
[00:57:08.752 --> 00:57:09.593]  Yes, Blackwater.
[00:57:09.873 --> 00:57:10.853]  What a rogue company.
[00:57:10.913 --> 00:57:13.694]  Do you know the families of those men that were burnt and hung?
[00:57:14.054 --> 00:57:16.094]  I heard another interview are suing Blackwater.
[00:57:16.814 --> 00:57:19.355]  Blackwater has reacted to those families.
[00:57:19.675 --> 00:57:22.116]  I'm telling you, Alex, it's criminal.
[00:57:22.816 --> 00:57:23.356]  It's criminal.
[00:57:23.396 --> 00:57:25.356]  They won't even tell those families.
[00:57:25.977 --> 00:57:32.738]  They won't even provide them with the report that was drawn up as to the events that led to the death of their loved ones.
[00:57:33.278 --> 00:57:35.519]  When their family members got to Iraq,
[00:57:36.201 --> 00:57:38.784]  Blackwater did things, wouldn't provide them with maps.
[00:57:38.844 --> 00:57:41.267]  In one case, disarmed a man and sent him on a mission.
[00:57:41.947 --> 00:57:44.070]  Rogue behavior on the part of that company.
[00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:47.213]  That eventually led to those men being killed that way.
[00:57:47.934 --> 00:57:49.616]  And these people are having a hard time.
[00:57:49.656 --> 00:57:52.519]  They went to our government to try and get some satisfaction.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.341]  They won't even touch the issue.
[00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:21.460]  In the last 30 seconds of this hour, I want to encourage everybody out there listening to go to InfoWars.com and the safe, secure online shopping cart at our video and bookstore and get my new 9-11 film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.

[00:59:01.002 --> 00:59:02.123]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.783 --> 00:59:03.584]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.345 --> 00:59:05.245]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.926 --> 00:59:09.749]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.089 --> 00:59:14.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.774 --> 00:59:19.657]  Now into the second hour on this live Thursday, the 25th day of April, 2006 edition.
[00:59:21.978 --> 00:59:34.945]  What would happen if Iran was caught through one of its surrogates, one of its minions, trying to sneak in 2,000 shoulder-launched missiles that can bring down commercial aircraft?
[00:59:35.665 --> 00:59:36.726]  Well, here's the headline.
[00:59:36.826 --> 00:59:37.666]  China's doing it.
[00:59:37.726 --> 00:59:39.808]  This is the second time I know of they've been caught.
[00:59:40.348 --> 00:59:43.630]  Back in 97, it was red-handed, connected to the Chinese military.
[00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:45.410]  What are they rewarded with?
[00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:46.531]  Running our port security.
[00:59:46.951 --> 00:59:49.273]  Oh, you're trying to bring in missiles, heroin, and machine guns.
[00:59:49.293 --> 00:59:49.593]  Here.
[00:59:50.794 --> 00:59:54.095]  Chinese man admits plot to import missiles to U.S.
[00:59:54.575 --> 01:00:05.339]  Reuters, a Chinese national living in Southern California, admitted on Wednesday to trying to arrange the sale from China to the United States of 200 shoulder-fired missiles that can be used to bring down aeroplanes.
[01:00:05.979 --> 01:00:14.522]  Chao-Tung Wu, 51, pled guilty in Los Angeles federal court to conspiring to import the missiles for a buyer who turned out to be an undercover FBI agent.
[01:00:14.582 --> 01:00:18.884]  Glad the FBI is doing something out there other than running around harassing patriots.
[01:00:19.972 --> 01:00:24.524]  This is out of the Washington Times, Bill Gertz, Chinese military linked to missile smuggling.
[01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:36.731]  Court papers made public yesterday in the case of California man who pled guilty to trying to smuggle anti-aircraft missiles into the United States show that Chinese general and state-run manufacturer are linked to the crime.
[01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:41.014]  Chow Tung Wu, 51, of California, pled guilty yesterday in U.S.
[01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:47.158]  District Court in Los Angeles to conspiracy to smuggle Chinese QW-2 anti-aircraft missiles into the United States.
[01:00:47.498 --> 01:00:54.903]  It was the first conviction under the 2004 anti-terrorism law into preventing the spread of shoulder-fired and portable anti-aircraft missiles.
[01:00:55.763 --> 01:01:01.787]  And the article then goes into how they basically, how it's connected to the Chinese military.
[01:01:01.807 --> 01:01:06.770]  And later after the break, later in the interview with Bill Vieth coming up, we will get more into this.
[01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:17.496]  And it mentions here that China's military has been linked in the past to illicit arms deals, including the attempted sale of AK-47 assault rifles to Los Angeles street gangs.
[01:01:17.516 --> 01:01:18.417]  That was the LA Times.
[01:01:18.937 --> 01:01:21.059]  And it doesn't mention the heroin of the other rockets.
[01:01:21.399 --> 01:01:23.081]  That was in there back in 1997.
[01:01:23.761 --> 01:01:30.907]  Wu informed the agent that there were 24 containers of weapons for sale including the missiles and that the minimum purchase would be eight containers.
[01:01:31.427 --> 01:01:40.395]  Documents provided that the agent included a proposal for the sale from the Chinese company which makes the QW-2 and other missiles.
[01:01:41.796 --> 01:01:43.437]  And the total price was going to be $18,380,000.
[01:01:46.862 --> 01:01:49.264]  $308,100 the statement said.
[01:01:51.546 --> 01:01:54.609]  So, our borders are wide open.
[01:01:55.029 --> 01:02:02.435]  They're having staged events where they go and arrest a thousand people, which we did the math, is .0000.
[01:02:03.636 --> 01:02:05.378]  Was it another zero you did in the calculator?
[01:02:06.058 --> 01:02:06.719]  How many zeros?
[01:02:11.334 --> 01:02:13.655]  Okay, so it's four zeros and a four, so five.
[01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:16.897]  I mean, just think about that.
[01:02:18.158 --> 01:02:20.919]  If they arrested a thousand people a day, what's 365 times a thousand?
[01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:21.479]  That would be 365,000.
[01:02:21.519 --> 01:02:24.921]  So if they arrested a thousand illegal aliens a day, what is 365,000 divided by 25 million?
[01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.382]  Again, I'm not... A little over 10%, right?
[01:02:26.482 --> 01:02:27.322]  No, a little over 1%.
[01:02:41.064 --> 01:02:43.526]  A little over 1%.
[01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:55.834]  So if for an entire year they arrested 1000 people a day instead of doing this once a year, it would only be 1% of the illegal aliens.
[01:02:57.495 --> 01:03:01.717]  So we need to write an article about that and put that in perspective.
[01:03:01.757 --> 01:03:08.882]  Now we're going to go break and come back with our guest Bill Vieth and we're going to get into some really important information for your financial future.
[01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:11.142]  We're not selling anything either.
[01:03:11.182 --> 01:03:12.443]  He's coming in on his own time.
[01:03:12.463 --> 01:03:13.724]  He's done a lot of study, a lot of research.
[01:03:13.744 --> 01:03:15.325]  I've heard him on the radio and other shows.
[01:03:15.345 --> 01:03:16.425]  I've known him for over a decade.
[01:03:17.386 --> 01:03:19.567]  So he's got the basic good information for you.
[01:03:20.028 --> 01:03:21.249]  So we're going to go over all of that.
[01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:23.950]  Then we're going to tie it into what's happening currently in the news.
[01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:34.597]  Keeping with us, if he wants to stay into the third hour, we have Mark Stevens joining us with adventures from legal land to get into just how corrupt and crazy our courts are.
[01:03:35.398 --> 01:03:38.580]  So it's all coming up on the other side and we will take your calls as well.
[01:03:39.457 --> 01:03:41.399]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.

[01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:12.866]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:13.086 --> 01:04:17.610]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.

[01:04:25.017 --> 01:04:25.797]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:04:25.837 --> 01:04:29.541]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.701 --> 01:04:32.223]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:04:32.463 --> 01:04:39.169]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:06:00.884 --> 01:06:02.364]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:06:02.464 --> 01:06:04.464]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:06:04.724 --> 01:06:10.245]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:06:10.526 --> 01:06:16.807]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.

[01:06:28.772 --> 01:06:32.255]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:33.676]  Now write this down, John.
[01:06:33.816 --> 01:06:38.119]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:06:38.259 --> 01:06:38.839]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:40.320]  I'm going there right now.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.381]  Check, please.
[01:06:43.142 --> 01:06:44.624]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:45.685]  Sure, John.

[01:06:52.433 --> 01:06:52.793]  Deal.
[01:06:54.015 --> 01:06:56.217]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.778 --> 01:06:59.581]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.108 --> 01:07:20.552]  Coming up in the next hour, Mark Stevens, author of Adventures in Legal Land, with a really interesting take on government, the state itself, is it legitimate in any form, and just the wild level of corruption that is now in state and federal courts around this country, and really the world.
[01:07:20.592 --> 01:07:24.873]  He'll be joining us, and Bill Vieth will be riding shotgun with us for at least part of that as well.
[01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:27.814]  Again, I've known Bill, he's never been on the show before,
[01:07:28.704 --> 01:07:42.049]  For about 10 years or longer, I've always seen with the Second Amendment demonstrations we have, we were barely beating Democrats and Republicans who were trying to restrict the Second Amendment down to almost New York style laws.
[01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:43.498]  I don't know.
[01:08:01.987 --> 01:08:02.328]  Okay, well, I
[01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:33.652]  Probably up until about six years ago, I was stuck in the left-right paradigm.
[01:08:34.032 --> 01:08:38.876]  So I'm not predisposed to believing the way I've come to believe in the last six years.
[01:08:39.376 --> 01:08:50.466]  But in listening to shows, programs like yours and other alternative media, I began to do my own search for the truth and stopped being so dependent on the mainstream media news.
[01:08:50.986 --> 01:08:57.852]  So what I focused my research on was, you know, back when they used to say, if you really want to know what's going on, follow the money.
[01:08:58.337 --> 01:09:03.819]  So I started following the money backwards, and I followed it all the way back to the people that print it out of thin air.
[01:09:04.379 --> 01:09:06.960]  And it's really not money, it's a system of worldwide credit.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.001]  And so that's what got me started.
[01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:25.927]  And then I realized that probably my conclusion is that if we were to magically go back to an honest money system of gold and silver coin rather than this fiat currency credit system, 99% of the world's problems would magically disappear if we could do that.
[01:09:28.067 --> 01:09:31.828]  The elite get so much power out of the power to coin the money.
[01:09:31.848 --> 01:09:36.709]  I mean, we always hear debates about who's wealthy, who's rich, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett.
[01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:47.672]  They're small players compared to the old-moneyed families that have their funds in tax-free foundations that literally own entire industries, entire countries, entire armament factories.
[01:09:47.772 --> 01:09:49.633]  I mean, these people are the true elite.
[01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:51.193]  Absolutely.
[01:09:51.633 --> 01:09:59.276]  I've read estimates that the Rothschilds' net worth is between $100 and $400 trillion, which dwarfs anything Bill Gates said.
[01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:02.477]  Yeah, a top Russian economist pegs it in between there at $300 trillion.
[01:10:02.777 --> 01:10:04.698]  Okay, that's within the range that I've read.
[01:10:04.758 --> 01:10:07.039]  They've got about 55% of the world's wealth.
[01:10:08.258 --> 01:10:14.223]  Yes, and probably if you add a few other dynasty families in there, it's probably closer to 75 or 80 percent.
[01:10:14.323 --> 01:10:14.903]  Oh, exactly.
[01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.085]  Just the Rothschilds alone.
[01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:18.627]  The Rockefellers have got about 25 percent of it.
[01:10:18.807 --> 01:10:23.571]  And by the way, major economic schools overseas know this.
[01:10:23.651 --> 01:10:24.092]  It's taught.
[01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:29.016]  In fact, people who are really in high-level finance, they all discuss this.
[01:10:29.076 --> 01:10:29.797]  It's all understood.
[01:10:29.817 --> 01:10:30.838]  There's almost like a false
[01:10:33.139 --> 01:10:36.901]  Let's get into the Federal Reserve.
[01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:38.942]  I know you've got your notes there.
[01:10:38.982 --> 01:10:40.002]  I've heard you go over it before.
[01:10:41.243 --> 01:10:47.005]  The best way you've found to explain this to the layman out there and why this system you believe isn't good.
[01:10:49.224 --> 01:11:01.875]  I would say the best way to explain it is by really going back to the basics, which almost seems so simplistic, it seems ridiculous, but nobody... I've asked over 250 people the question, what is the definition of a dollar?
[01:11:02.335 --> 01:11:05.778]  No one's ever gotten it right, and until a year ago, I didn't even know what it was.
[01:11:06.358 --> 01:11:16.167]  You know, here I've gone through the education system, a formal education, I've got two doctorate degrees, and I never learned what a dollar was until I went and researched it on my own.
[01:11:16.827 --> 01:11:26.156]  And the reason that's so important, what a dollar is, a constitutional dollar, is a United States manufactured coin of 371.25 grains of silver.
[01:11:26.756 --> 01:11:28.077]  And that's its value.
[01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:33.302]  Its value is not measured in economic terms, it's measured in its weight in silver in a coin.
[01:11:33.962 --> 01:11:35.543]  And that makes it very hard to manipulate.
[01:11:35.663 --> 01:11:40.407]  You can't manipulate it because you cannot change the value of it if its weight is in silver.
[01:11:40.708 --> 01:11:45.171]  For example, the value of an inch is not measured in economic terms.
[01:11:45.992 --> 01:11:47.273]  It's measured in its length.
[01:11:47.853 --> 01:11:48.194]  Okay?
[01:11:48.774 --> 01:11:54.098]  Congress has no authority to change the value of an inch or the value of a second or the value of an ounce.
[01:11:54.419 --> 01:11:56.020]  Those are our standard weights and measures.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.281]  It's the same with a dollar.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:09.790]  And when you have honest weights and measures, it engineers the economy to be based in a free market system where actual labor and ideas are valued and those individuals rise.
[01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:14.174]  But in a fiat system, it allows these wicked control freaks to get total control.
[01:12:14.474 --> 01:12:15.234]  Well, absolutely.
[01:12:15.274 --> 01:12:21.520]  And the main reason it does that in the free market system is the dollar, you have to have a constant.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.067]  That never changes value and then you can measure the change in every other dependent variable if you have that constant independent variable.
[01:12:30.468 --> 01:12:39.676]  But in the fiat dollar it floats so we never know what its value is so we can never accurately measure the change in the value of anything else because we're never holding anything constant.
[01:12:40.197 --> 01:12:48.024]  So it doesn't matter if it's a silver coin we could have our standard unit of measurement for money could be a bag of
[01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:49.164]  Sand.
[01:12:49.485 --> 01:12:55.008]  And as long as we hold that constant and never change it, we can still measure the value of everything else.
[01:12:55.148 --> 01:12:56.069]  It could be salt.
[01:12:56.329 --> 01:12:57.890]  It could be in the past slaves.
[01:12:57.930 --> 01:12:58.890]  It could be armaments.
[01:12:59.011 --> 01:13:01.132]  It could be seashells with two holes in them.
[01:13:01.172 --> 01:13:01.312]  Right.
[01:13:02.032 --> 01:13:05.495]  It can be anything as long as you hold one thing constant.
[01:13:05.895 --> 01:13:11.438]  But if we allowed the value of our inch to float every day, it would mess up our whole world.
[01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.699]  We couldn't measure anything.
[01:13:12.759 --> 01:13:14.260]  We wouldn't know what we were getting.
[01:13:15.398 --> 01:13:16.459]  And that's part of the deception.
[01:13:16.519 --> 01:13:27.602]  Not only do these elites literally own the private printing presses known as the world's central banks, and then invade countries that don't have those and install those central banks as control systems that control the entire economic system.
[01:13:29.262 --> 01:13:37.565]  At the same time, the people aren't able to truly measure what's really happening to them, and it's simply they have their view economically based on the propaganda.
[01:13:38.065 --> 01:13:41.386]  Absolutely, and like when you say propaganda, see we've allowed them
[01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:42.547]  We're good to go.
[01:13:57.464 --> 01:14:08.415]  It's not that I'm even that smart, but now it's hard for me to even communicate with even educated people because they've been given a false lexicon or a false encyclopedia and they can't even communicate now.
[01:14:08.495 --> 01:14:11.838]  That's exactly right, and one of the main things they've done it with is the dollar.
[01:14:12.259 --> 01:14:18.065]  They haven't changed what a constitutional dollar is, they've only changed the verbiage that describes it.
[01:14:18.465 --> 01:14:22.008]  So now we have a fiat dollar that we call a dollar, and it's not a dollar.
[01:14:22.468 --> 01:14:24.050]  It's a unit of debt.
[01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:27.993]  It's a piece of paper that signifies there is a debt out there.
[01:14:28.633 --> 01:14:29.274]  Here's an example.
[01:14:29.314 --> 01:14:36.840]  If we would have stayed on the silver system or the gold system, which some of the Arabs, even the Chinese, are now trying to move to, which is really going to mess us up.
[01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:44.246]  If we would have done that, Bush in five years wouldn't have been able to devalue the dollar by design by 44%.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:52.581]  George Bush and his globalist controllers, make no mistake, he's a puppet, wouldn't have been able to play all these games.
[01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:55.162]  That is a huge tax on your wealth.
[01:14:55.222 --> 01:14:57.782]  And now the new Fed Chief is saying it's unlimited.
[01:14:57.802 --> 01:14:59.243]  They're going to go wild.
[01:14:59.423 --> 01:15:05.944]  And then the banks, by the way, are able to loan out 9, 10, sometimes 20 times per dollar you put in the bank.
[01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:11.045]  They then loan out fiat currency that's just on a sheet of paper or in a computer.
[01:15:11.485 --> 01:15:13.145]  And then they want you to default.
[01:15:13.185 --> 01:15:14.566]  They want you to not pay the credit cards.
[01:15:14.586 --> 01:15:15.906]  They want you to not pay for the mortgage.
[01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:18.747]  Then they get real tangible assets.
[01:15:18.787 --> 01:15:21.427]  A Ponzi scheme isn't a strong enough word.
[01:15:21.447 --> 01:15:24.968]  It is a carnival barker, grifter, shell game.
[01:15:25.368 --> 01:15:25.948]  Absolutely.
[01:15:27.069 --> 01:15:29.469]  Basically, we have global loan sharks.
[01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:32.730]  And what they lend, they create out of thin air.
[01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:33.870]  They create it out of nothing.
[01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:34.811]  They lend credit.
[01:15:35.271 --> 01:15:36.251]  And to them, it's credit.
[01:15:36.271 --> 01:15:37.131]  To us, it's debt.
[01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:40.872]  And they're putting the world in debt through this false monetary system.
[01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:48.297]  And it's really, to use a physics term, it's a black hole where nothing can escape.
[01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:57.366]  It is designed to build to a certain point and then blow the Ponzi scheme and then everyone basically becomes sharecroppers who owe their souls to the company store.
[01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:01.711]  It's that same thing of where they would pay people, sharecroppers were basically slaves that didn't know it,
[01:16:02.552 --> 01:16:09.860]  Not enough to ever get out of debt, and they'd buy everything at inflated prices from a company store, and you'd have people for generations that are literally slaves.
[01:16:10.501 --> 01:16:11.001]  Absolutely.
[01:16:11.262 --> 01:16:15.767]  Well, it's the same principle as, suppose four of us sat down to play the game Monopoly.
[01:16:16.528 --> 01:16:22.632]  And we all get a certain amount of money to start the game to purchase properties so we can collect rent on those properties.
[01:16:22.972 --> 01:16:32.279]  Well, suppose one of those four entities playing the game could reach under the table and had an unlimited supply of these Monopoly dollars.
[01:16:32.339 --> 01:16:33.239]  Ooh, that's a better analogy.
[01:16:33.259 --> 01:16:33.960]  I'm going to steal that.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:34.860]  Yeah, you can take it.
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:41.885]  I mean, that guy will wind up with all of the property on the board, and everybody else will be a renter or a debtor to that person.
[01:16:42.045 --> 01:16:45.908]  Yeah, you and I get $100 a piece, and then he's got an 18-wheeler full of hundreds.
[01:16:46.288 --> 01:16:46.848]  Right.
[01:16:47.009 --> 01:16:48.069]  Or he's got an endless supply.
[01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.751]  He creates it out of thin air.
[01:16:50.471 --> 01:16:51.112]  You can't beat him.
[01:16:51.132 --> 01:16:53.654]  And then he even loans it to us for real assets we've got.
[01:16:53.714 --> 01:16:54.234]  Exactly.
[01:16:54.394 --> 01:16:54.795]  Exactly.
[01:16:54.835 --> 01:16:57.857]  You cannot beat that game, and that's the game that's going on.
[01:16:58.437 --> 01:17:02.300]  Every single country in the world, their central banks have a fiat currency system.
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.683]  There are no countries that trade in gold and silver coin.
[01:17:05.943 --> 01:17:07.024]  Well, at least at a casino, it's $60, $40, $70, $30, $55, $45.
[01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.705]  And of course, that's a total scam.
[01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:17.812]  But, I mean, this is a casino where there's no way to win, unless you're an insider.
[01:17:18.012 --> 01:17:26.659]  You cannot win, and they have imposed this on the entire world, and that's the way they're going to move their one-world government forward, is through the currency.
[01:17:26.919 --> 01:17:37.047]  I had Walter Berry on a few days ago, and I've looked at all his documents, even the former Comptroller of the Air Force says it's true, and the government investments, and this is off-budget, as you know, but for the listeners,
[01:17:38.012 --> 01:17:48.815]  The government investments and just cream, you know, in the black, extra money that they don't even discuss, every year is almost triple the entire GDP of the American people now.
[01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:52.036]  I mean, it's just, it's off the charts la-la land.
[01:17:52.076 --> 01:18:03.359]  He said now, I had him on a few years ago, it was up at 75% that they owned, and this is corporations and government merging, now he says it's 83%, in just a few more years they're going to own everything.
[01:18:04.219 --> 01:18:17.401]  And every time they issue more credit into the worldwide system, it dilutes the purchasing power of the credit instruments that are already in circulation, and that's a tax on the people, and it's a way to enslave the people.
[01:18:17.981 --> 01:18:19.062]  I mean, you're a middle class guy.
[01:18:19.082 --> 01:18:31.224]  Would you rather have Bush's 6% on average tax cut, I don't know what bracket you're in, but let's say 6% for someone in the middle income, would you rather, and I want you to answer this over the break, would you rather have that 6% cut, or would you rather have your dollar not be devalued by 44%?
[01:18:32.951 --> 01:18:34.452]  So I want to get your answer on that when we get back.
[01:18:34.472 --> 01:18:39.055]  And then let's get into the Bretton Woods Agreement and how this is all set up and what you think geopolitically is going on.
[01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:46.199]  Because we had this global agreement to not dump the dollar, but now we see a rebellion, or is it staged?
[01:18:46.499 --> 01:18:48.541]  Your opinion, why are people moving away from the dollar?
[01:18:48.841 --> 01:18:49.761]  Why is it in free fall?
[01:18:49.801 --> 01:18:50.962]  And why does Bush say that's good?
[01:18:51.182 --> 01:18:52.163]  We'll be right back with Bill Dee.
[01:18:53.999 --> 01:18:56.060]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.502]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:18:58.802 --> 01:18:59.482]  New toenails?
[01:18:59.862 --> 01:19:00.863]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:19:01.843 --> 01:19:04.545]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:19:05.065 --> 01:19:06.486]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:19:06.506 --> 01:19:09.288]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[01:19:09.528 --> 01:19:10.908]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:19:11.349 --> 01:19:13.010]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:14.530]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:17.392]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:19:17.612 --> 01:19:18.813]  Well, here's my secret.
[01:19:19.406 --> 01:19:20.446]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:20.927 --> 01:19:24.988]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:26.608]  Ah, so that's it.
[01:19:26.868 --> 01:19:29.409]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:31.330]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:34.851]  Now you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[01:19:35.291 --> 01:19:35.832]  You bet!
[01:19:36.052 --> 01:19:40.156]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[01:19:40.316 --> 01:19:41.857]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:42.218 --> 01:19:43.379]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:43.539 --> 01:19:45.220]  For clear, healthy looking nails.
[01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:50.686]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[01:19:50.866 --> 01:19:51.887]  In the foot care section.
[01:19:55.345 --> 01:19:56.406]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.786 --> 01:20:02.290]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:03.350]  That's right.
[01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:05.952]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.512 --> 01:20:13.437]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:21.701]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.121 --> 01:20:26.924]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.612 --> 01:20:32.634]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.414 --> 01:20:37.555]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:37.935 --> 01:20:38.175]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.215 --> 01:20:40.136]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.196 --> 01:20:40.496]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.796 --> 01:20:41.076]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.832 --> 01:20:56.715]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:20:57.055 --> 01:20:59.937]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:21:00.157 --> 01:21:06.383]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:21:06.743 --> 01:21:14.049]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:57.081]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:21:57.342 --> 01:21:58.202]  Look no further!
[01:21:58.502 --> 01:22:01.063]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:22:01.503 --> 01:22:10.007]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.

[01:22:11.988 --> 01:22:12.408]  I think so.
[01:22:27.754 --> 01:22:28.154]  I'm good.
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.124]  We don't need no education.
[01:23:00.126 --> 01:23:01.688]  We don't need your thought control.
[01:23:07.038 --> 01:23:07.518]  Welcome back.
[01:23:07.538 --> 01:23:08.379]  The calls are coming up.
[01:23:08.399 --> 01:23:12.920]  Bill Vieth, psychologist, good friend of mine, local Austinite activist, joins us.
[01:23:13.441 --> 01:23:25.265]  We've done a lot of studying on the agreements that were made about how to set up the world financial system right after World War II, and then again they had meetings in the 80s, and now it seems that that old order is breaking up.
[01:23:25.465 --> 01:23:30.347]  Give us your take on it historically, walk us through it, and then, oh, but first off, answer that question.
[01:23:30.387 --> 01:23:33.268]  Would you rather have a 6% tax cut or have your dollar not be
[01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:38.454]  No question I'd rather not have the dollar devalued.
[01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.306]  Thirty-nine percent.
[01:23:44.866 --> 01:23:45.467]  Absolutely.
[01:23:45.547 --> 01:23:53.472]  I mean, you know, the history of fiat currency shows that every single one in history eventually reaches its intrinsic value, which is zero.
[01:23:53.532 --> 01:23:54.693]  And there's not one exception.
[01:23:54.753 --> 01:23:58.496]  And there's no reason to think that the United States dollar would be an exception to that rule.
[01:23:58.896 --> 01:23:59.837]  They're debasing it.
[01:23:59.917 --> 01:24:03.199]  And once it starts its plunge, it never stops.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.682]  Gold hitting $640 an ounce yesterday.
[01:24:09.063 --> 01:24:13.746]  Going back down to $638, oil going above $74 a barrel crude.
[01:24:13.786 --> 01:24:14.446]  Comments on that?
[01:24:14.986 --> 01:24:19.409]  Well, that's not gold going up or oil going up.
[01:24:19.449 --> 01:24:22.471]  That's the purchasing power of the dollar going down.
[01:24:22.551 --> 01:24:30.075]  As they dilute the credit into the system, it takes more of those pieces of paper to purchase the same items.
[01:24:31.175 --> 01:24:34.238]  If you look at them against each other, they're not changing in value.
[01:24:34.398 --> 01:24:38.161]  The only person I heard in mainstream media to tell the truth on this was John Stossel.
[01:24:38.821 --> 01:24:45.787]  Locally, on Kelby Jay, they air his reports sometimes, and there he was admitting it, but he was acting like it was okay then.
[01:24:45.867 --> 01:24:46.728]  No, it's not okay.
[01:24:47.608 --> 01:24:52.252]  No, it's not okay, and I think, again, we should not adopt the language of the globalists.
[01:24:52.933 --> 01:24:56.715]  See, I make a distinction between the word value and the word purchasing power.
[01:24:57.336 --> 01:24:58.597]  Values don't change.
[01:24:59.436 --> 01:25:00.898]  The value of an inch doesn't change.
[01:25:00.938 --> 01:25:02.660]  The value of a dollar doesn't change.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.622]  It's 371.25 grains of silver.
[01:25:05.103 --> 01:25:08.307]  But the purchasing power of the fiat dollar changes minute to minute.
[01:25:09.528 --> 01:25:12.251]  Second to second on the mercantilism.
[01:25:12.271 --> 01:25:12.592]  You're right.
[01:25:12.612 --> 01:25:13.092]  I agree with you.
[01:25:13.553 --> 01:25:16.015]  So get into the history of some of this for people.
[01:25:17.097 --> 01:25:18.818]  Starting about what year would you like me to start?
[01:25:19.138 --> 01:25:19.759]  Wherever you like.
[01:25:20.319 --> 01:25:42.493]  Well, you know, right from the beginning, from the adoption of the Constitution, the central bankers from Europe had always been trying to impose a central banking system of paper credit into the society, and the founding fathers knew what that, you know, would entail, so they
[01:25:43.337 --> 01:25:48.680]  He gave certain powers to Congress and said that Congress had the power to coin money.
[01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:52.883]  And money was defined basically as a gold and silver coin.
[01:25:53.283 --> 01:25:59.167]  And Congress was prohibited from emitting bills of credit, which is what we have now.
[01:25:59.907 --> 01:26:08.853]  And so there was always this pressure right from the beginning to establish a central bank where they could impose bills of credit on us and get away from an honest monetary system.
[01:26:09.389 --> 01:26:17.338]  So it went through several machinations over time, and then the Federal Reserve came into existence in 1913, and that was the beginning of the end.
[01:26:17.899 --> 01:26:26.509]  But the first 20 years of the Federal Reserve, those pieces of paper, those dollars, were redeemable on demand for gold or silver coin.
[01:26:27.369 --> 01:26:36.791]  In 1933, as we know, Roosevelt came in and basically stole the money from the people by making them turn in their gold to the central banks.
[01:26:36.911 --> 01:26:39.892]  And a lot of people, when they hear this, email me and say, that's not true.
[01:26:39.912 --> 01:26:41.092]  I've talked to my grandmother.
[01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:42.353]  It's part of the public record.
[01:26:42.513 --> 01:26:44.533]  In 1933, he got into office.
[01:26:44.573 --> 01:26:45.833]  He said, turn all your gold in.
[01:26:45.853 --> 01:26:49.714]  And once he got the gold, overnight, he said, we're allowed to sell it to Europe.
[01:26:49.734 --> 01:26:50.835]  They basically gave it to Europe.
[01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:52.355]  And then overnight, they doubled the price.
[01:26:53.095 --> 01:27:08.155]  And you know, actually, most of the gold had already been turned in because people would take their gold to the central banks and get these receipts for the gold, which we call dollars, believing that those receipts, those pieces of paper, would be redeemable on demand.
[01:27:08.535 --> 01:27:09.416]  And they were for 20 years.
[01:27:10.397 --> 01:27:13.940]  And so as people began to realize, hey, this is pretty good.
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:19.224]  Every time I take my paper in, I'm given gold or silver, they would take more gold down to store.
[01:27:19.665 --> 01:27:23.308]  And so once the central banks had most of the gold, then they stole it.
[01:27:23.348 --> 01:27:23.848]  The U.S.
[01:27:23.868 --> 01:27:27.011]  government, folks, outlawed gold, openly shipped it to Europe.
[01:27:27.031 --> 01:27:29.673]  They would arrest you if you didn't turn your gold in.
[01:27:29.733 --> 01:27:31.114]  And I understand that.
[01:27:31.594 --> 01:27:33.096]  And they gave you paper back.
[01:27:33.316 --> 01:27:33.536]  Right.
[01:27:34.037 --> 01:27:37.841]  And you know, the Constitution says only gold and silver coin is money.
[01:27:37.981 --> 01:27:40.204]  So they literally stole the money from the people.
[01:27:40.904 --> 01:27:42.786]  Okay, then, but they didn't do it with silver.
[01:27:42.987 --> 01:27:47.512]  Silver was still, so we've always had a bimetallic, we've always had a silver standard.
[01:27:47.892 --> 01:27:49.634]  The silver dollar is the unit of account.
[01:27:49.654 --> 01:27:51.356]  We've never been on a gold standard.
[01:27:52.210 --> 01:27:58.697]  Yes, for a while we were on kind of a statutory gold standard for five years between 1873 and 1878, but we went off of that.
[01:27:58.757 --> 01:28:02.020]  But our standard for the monetary system is silver.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:05.343]  It always was and it still is constitutionally.
[01:28:06.044 --> 01:28:12.811]  So up until 1968, people could still turn in their dollars theoretically and get silver coin.
[01:28:13.211 --> 01:28:13.932]  That stopped in 68.
[01:28:15.876 --> 01:28:17.737]  And then in, want me to finish when we come back?
[01:28:17.757 --> 01:28:18.457]  Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[01:28:18.477 --> 01:28:20.397]  And then we can also go back and talk about Kennedy in 1963.
[01:28:20.797 --> 01:28:23.778]  He tries to issue 40-something billion in greenbacks.
[01:28:23.798 --> 01:28:25.899]  He gets $4 billion out before they blow his head off.
[01:28:26.519 --> 01:28:29.080]  And you can still find those $5 bills that don't say Federal Reserve.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.200]  They have a red stamp.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:36.162]  And it says Lincoln Greenback, which I guess would be redeemable in silver, but they weren't about to allow that to happen.
[01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:36.982]  Stay with us.
[01:28:37.002 --> 01:28:37.802]  Bill Viest, our guest.
[01:28:37.822 --> 01:28:40.023]  This is so important to your financial future.
[01:28:40.303 --> 01:28:42.264]  You're not going to hear this anywhere else in mainstream media.
[01:28:44.129 --> 01:28:47.139]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.062 --> 01:28:50.751]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:53.846 --> 01:30:01.371]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.651 --> 01:30:12.559]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.819 --> 01:30:14.620]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:18.221]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:28.984]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:29.304 --> 01:30:29.805]  That's right!
[01:30:29.985 --> 01:30:37.092]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.392 --> 01:30:41.536]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[01:30:54.443 --> 01:30:57.765]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[01:30:58.185 --> 01:31:02.347]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[01:31:02.868 --> 01:31:10.252]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:14.683]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[01:31:15.063 --> 01:31:28.493]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cost for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[01:31:28.933 --> 01:31:32.296]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of Stem in Hands.
[01:31:32.696 --> 01:31:36.619]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[01:31:37.299 --> 01:31:40.222]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[01:31:40.382 --> 01:31:43.205]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis at 860-567-7744.
[01:31:43.225 --> 01:31:44.686]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[01:31:57.150 --> 01:31:59.651]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:32:00.171 --> 01:32:02.873]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:14.256 --> 01:32:25.223]  ...is a global consortium of top economics experts who try to work in concert to bring into fruition the global economy.
[01:32:25.243 --> 01:32:29.906]  And they said that they're going to have an Asian Union, an American Union, a European Union.
[01:32:30.346 --> 01:32:36.170]  They're going to play those currencies off against each other and then convince the people that they need a global currency.
[01:32:36.210 --> 01:32:42.254]  And they're now openly discussing this this year at the Davos Switzerland Conference.
[01:32:42.974 --> 01:33:04.074]  They came out and said, well, we'll also have our currencies in a few years, but they'll all be at a global benchmark to stop this wild fluctuation, and then that will give them global control to then, in a unified way, manipulate the currencies and debase them even further, robbing us of the value of our daily work and the energies that we expend.
[01:33:04.694 --> 01:33:16.813]  And simultaneously you see a move to destroy property rights where, in kind of an imperial way, the government says if some local robber baron wants your property, he can take it, but they don't tell you about the New London
[01:33:17.814 --> 01:33:28.123]  Connecticut cases, they're not even paying people tax value, they're paying them condemned value in many cases, or nothing at all that they resist.
[01:33:28.183 --> 01:33:39.652]  So, similar to the riots we see in China as the farmers refuse to have their land stolen, these peasants, it's happening here in America and we're just rolling over for it because we just can't get that it can actually happen here.
[01:33:41.453 --> 01:33:48.218]  Going back to Bill Vieth, who's done a lot of research on this subject, a local Austin activist, and of course has two doctorates in psychology.
[01:33:49.999 --> 01:34:07.331]  Bill, or Doctor, please continue getting into this, because you had gotten up with the gold being confiscated in 1933 and the whole War Powers Act, then accelerating up into the late 60s and the dual system they had us on, and now where we are today.
[01:34:07.351 --> 01:34:08.372]  Let's talk about Bretton Woods.
[01:34:08.832 --> 01:34:12.255]  Okay, yeah, Bretton Woods was a major event in our monetary history.
[01:34:14.937 --> 01:34:25.465]  Toward the conclusion of World War II, the major countries of the world got together at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, at a hotel.
[01:34:26.025 --> 01:34:26.245]  I think?
[01:34:47.970 --> 01:34:58.115]  What they did was they decided that the central banks in all of these countries were going to hold dollars as their reserve assets to peg their own currency against.
[01:34:58.495 --> 01:35:01.737]  So they no longer had to hold gold or silver in reserve.
[01:35:02.017 --> 01:35:10.562]  They could hold dollars because the United States promised that those dollars would be redeemable internationally on demand for gold.
[01:35:11.142 --> 01:35:12.883]  And so the countries of the world
[01:35:13.556 --> 01:35:17.858]  Believe them, just like the people of the United States did, that those dollars would always be redeemable.
[01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:18.659]  Well, it's simple.
[01:35:18.699 --> 01:35:33.647]  You have the Bangalore American establishment, even Forbes admits the biggest owner of American companies are the British oligarchy, and the Sachs-Coburg does the Rothschilds others, and so they openly said, we got the big military, you're going to do this, and countries that didn't got invaded.
[01:35:34.007 --> 01:35:36.569]  Absolutely, and are still getting invaded to this day.
[01:35:36.589 --> 01:35:38.770]  There's a few countries that are not under the umbrella
[01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.550]  I think?
[01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.851]  I think?
[01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.250]  I think?
[01:36:19.685 --> 01:36:34.168]  They set up an oil exchange in London and the United States and basically the rule was that all oil purchases in the world would be settled in dollars at those two exchanges.
[01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:41.350]  And so they pegged the basic energy measurement or value to their fiat system as well.
[01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:50.819]  Right, so if let's say Japan wanted to buy oil, they couldn't use yen to buy the oil, they had to use yen to buy dollars and use dollars to buy the oil.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:37:02.370]  If Namibia or Cuba or any country wanted to buy oil, they had to get United States dollars because they had to buy it at either the London or the New York oil exchange and they would only sell it in dollars.
[01:37:02.410 --> 01:37:04.032]  So we imposed
[01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:20.420]  The fiat dollar on the rest of the world and now the entire world had to start competing for the United States dollars and then many countries, even if they traded with each other in other commodities or resources, they only settled their accounts in United States dollars.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:29.684]  So literally, the dollar became the world's reserve currency and it was in demand all over the world so the United States could import inflation worldwide.
[01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:59.133]  And then the euro came online four and a half years ago, and since then we've seen a massive slide in the value of the dollar from the euro being valued at its opening at 87 cents to the dollar, now being valued, depending on what day you look at it, at $1.30 above the dollar, $1.35 above the dollar, or my mother was just over in Italy visiting friends, and she said, yeah, 10, or, she was describing how basically six euros is $10.
[01:38:00.513 --> 01:38:04.314]  Okay, well, you know, the euro is a fiat currency also.
[01:38:04.394 --> 01:38:07.574]  It's no better than the dollar, it's just newer in its lifespan.
[01:38:08.114 --> 01:38:10.215]  If you look at... They haven't inflated it yet.
[01:38:10.335 --> 01:38:10.535]  Right.
[01:38:11.015 --> 01:38:11.575]  Not as much.
[01:38:12.175 --> 01:38:15.836]  They actually have inflated it, just less than what we've inflated the dollar.
[01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:18.136]  So in relative terms, they haven't inflated it.
[01:38:18.156 --> 01:38:20.837]  So basically the same globalists are starting a new Ponzi scheme.
[01:38:20.917 --> 01:38:21.477]  Exactly.
[01:38:21.617 --> 01:38:22.017]  Exactly.
[01:38:22.077 --> 01:38:25.438]  Because they know that every fiat currency has a lifespan.
[01:38:25.498 --> 01:38:27.678]  It has a beginning, and a middle, and an end.
[01:38:28.258 --> 01:38:35.980]  And as you look at the decline curve, as it reaches its end, the decline curve starts to go parabolic, and that's when they know they have to implement another system.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:36.700]  It speeds up.
[01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:39.661]  It speeds up, that's what the other... Where are we right now on that graph?
[01:38:39.681 --> 01:38:41.062]  You can show the cameras that are in here.
[01:38:41.102 --> 01:38:52.585]  Well, if you're going down, you start, you know, the dollar starts to decline very gradually, and then the slope gets steeper and steeper and steeper, and all of a sudden it starts to just drop off a table, and we're right where it's starting to drop off that table.
[01:38:52.625 --> 01:38:56.766]  I was about to say, every indicator is, and every indices is, that it's starting to plunge.
[01:38:56.906 --> 01:39:01.768]  That's called the parabolic decline, where you start to get the curve, instead of the straight line decline, it curves down.
[01:39:03.928 --> 01:39:12.811]  I mean, this is amazing, and these same people, as they do this to us, I talk to successful people, and I talk to millionaires who don't even understand this.
[01:39:13.627 --> 01:39:16.910]  I wouldn't top that in economics, and they just roll their eyes at you.
[01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:22.135]  But some poor immigrant from China or Mexico, they know all about having a weak currency.
[01:39:22.576 --> 01:39:26.560]  Well, because they've been stuck enough times with their currencies losing their value.
[01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:27.561]  See, it's never happened.
[01:39:27.881 --> 01:39:31.364]  Generation after generation after generation, it hasn't happened in the United States.
[01:39:31.424 --> 01:39:32.786]  We've been able to impose
[01:39:33.426 --> 01:39:37.387]  The currency system for a longer period of time because it is the world's reserve currency.
[01:39:37.407 --> 01:39:42.369]  So why is the Bretton Woods Agreement post-World War II breaking up?
[01:39:42.489 --> 01:39:54.073]  I mean I talked about it earlier and the Trilateral Commission said that they had to basically hide the parabolic plunge that you were just talking about and so to do that they have to give other false alternatives.
[01:39:54.113 --> 01:39:55.093]  It's kind of like with Bush.
[01:39:56.391 --> 01:40:02.635]  He's seen as the evil neocon, so the global media acts like, oh, but the loving liberal UN will shave you.
[01:40:02.855 --> 01:40:04.156]  They give us false choices.
[01:40:04.256 --> 01:40:05.176]  Is that what you see happening?
[01:40:05.277 --> 01:40:05.857]  Yes, I do.
[01:40:05.937 --> 01:40:12.121]  And, you know, actually, I see it as, in 1971, I think we actually entered into Bretton Woods II.
[01:40:13.161 --> 01:40:19.645]  What happened in 1971 was the United States defaulted worldwide on redemption of dollars for gold.
[01:40:20.146 --> 01:40:25.289]  So, starting in 1971 is really the year that we started being a full-blown fiat currency.
[01:40:26.174 --> 01:40:29.478]  Before that, it was still redeemable in gold internationally.
[01:40:29.498 --> 01:40:31.481]  People talk about what a conservative Nixon was.
[01:40:31.581 --> 01:40:38.589]  Price-fixing, dozens of new federal agencies, taking us off the silver and gold standard.
[01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:40.251]  Well, he wasn't a conservative.
[01:40:40.271 --> 01:40:41.292]  He was a straight globalist.
[01:40:41.332 --> 01:40:45.337]  He was a puppet of the globalists, as all our presidents have been since Lincoln.
[01:40:45.877 --> 01:41:00.619]  But in 1971, when we went off the gold standard internationally, the United States had made agreements with OPEC to only sell oil in dollars worldwide and only at certain prices.
[01:41:01.199 --> 01:41:05.883]  And so we kind of went off the gold standard, but we went on an oil standard.
[01:41:06.263 --> 01:41:10.947]  And oil has been the de facto backer of the dollar since 1971, and that's breaking down.
[01:41:11.047 --> 01:41:17.052]  And so militarily, the Anglo-American establishment has to dominate those oil reserves and those oil pools.
[01:41:17.352 --> 01:41:19.634]  People always think, well, Saddam, you know,
[01:41:20.314 --> 01:41:24.777]  Our government didn't want the oil, because now the oil isn't even flowing at previous levels.
[01:41:25.237 --> 01:41:31.281]  They don't understand that the globalists have said in their own documents, they got mad at Saddam in 1990 for quote, over-pumping.
[01:41:31.641 --> 01:41:33.622]  OPEC got mad, it was driving down prices.
[01:41:33.662 --> 01:41:34.843]  He said, I'm just paying off my debts.
[01:41:35.143 --> 01:41:36.044]  I have a right to do this.
[01:41:36.084 --> 01:41:37.605]  I have a right to sell as much oil as I want.
[01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:38.825]  Then they set him up.
[01:41:39.206 --> 01:41:41.087]  I'm not defending Saddam, he was one of their cronies.
[01:41:41.427 --> 01:41:44.929]  But I mean, right there it shows they actually want to keep oil prices
[01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:48.592]  Not only that, but they have to keep it where oil is only settled in dollars.
[01:42:00.783 --> 01:42:01.183]  Exactly.
[01:42:01.403 --> 01:42:12.508]  Because if it starts to be settled in Euros or seashells or gold or silver, anything else but dollars, then the dollar will continue its implosion.
[01:42:12.828 --> 01:42:18.451]  The Arabs are always talking about going to a gold system where you have to buy their oil and gold.
[01:42:18.511 --> 01:42:20.812]  The problem is there's not that much gold out there.
[01:42:21.132 --> 01:42:23.513]  Now the Chinese are coming into the gold market.
[01:42:23.553 --> 01:42:29.476]  The Chai Kom government is allowing people to buy gold, and I think that's part of one of the things that's stimulating the surge in gold prices.
[01:42:30.026 --> 01:42:35.227]  Well, I'm sure it is, but I think it's kind of a fallacy to say there isn't enough gold out there.
[01:42:35.628 --> 01:42:36.288]  There is enough.
[01:42:36.348 --> 01:42:40.849]  All you have to do is revalue the gold price.
[01:42:41.289 --> 01:42:45.270]  Make a smaller unit worth more, which is actually how supply and demand works.
[01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.990]  Exactly.
[01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:58.614]  What it would do is it would bring down the false prices that we have of everything based on this inflated currency, and everything would get back into line with the real value against gold or silver.
[01:42:59.114 --> 01:43:00.275]  And so there is enough gold.
[01:43:00.655 --> 01:43:13.723]  And then these Keynesian economists from the British School of Economics there in London, they try to say, well, the fiat system is good because it encourages people because their money is being devalued at a moderate pace.
[01:43:13.743 --> 01:43:14.764]  Now it's at lightning speed.
[01:43:15.244 --> 01:43:18.126]  It encourages people to spend and keep the quote economy growing.
[01:43:18.166 --> 01:43:27.852]  But we look at previous economies, our own economy, the strongest, fastest growing real value economies are the economies that aren't fiat.
[01:43:28.532 --> 01:43:38.177]  Well, that's a historical and statistical fact, that if you look through civilizations, that during the periods they used gold and silver coin, they prospered.
[01:43:38.517 --> 01:43:44.680]  And it was when they started to debase the coinage or implement other types of fiat currency systems is when they declined.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:50.303]  The Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, the French, I mean, it just goes on and on.
[01:43:51.083 --> 01:43:53.645]  Absolutely, and those are historical facts, those are not opinions.
[01:43:55.629 --> 01:44:09.193]  So from your studying, Dr. Belvede, when you look at it, it's pretty clear then that there isn't some global war between elites going on over who will have the preeminent currency because we know that these institutions are owned by the same individuals.
[01:44:09.473 --> 01:44:11.234]  This is just a grand manipulation.
[01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:12.234]  Right.
[01:44:13.114 --> 01:44:15.115]  They centralize by increments.
[01:44:15.555 --> 01:44:16.216]  I think so.
[01:44:32.916 --> 01:44:40.563]  And now if they can get us into a three currency system and make it look like they're competing, they can play one off the other, devalue all of them or two of them against one.
[01:44:40.603 --> 01:44:43.245]  And then say just what they said with the 1913 Federal Reserve Act.
[01:44:43.706 --> 01:44:46.769]  Oh, we've been having global spikes in currency value.
[01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:52.434]  That's because the currencies are fighting with each other, not because they're based on a fraud measurement or value.
[01:44:52.894 --> 01:44:54.936]  And then, oh, we have one currency.
[01:44:54.956 --> 01:44:56.778]  If we have one system, it'll be okay.
[01:44:56.918 --> 01:44:57.078]  Right.
[01:44:57.558 --> 01:45:05.823]  And this fighting between currencies is not really fighting, it's intentional manipulation so that nobody ever knows the value of their currency so they can continue to steal the wealth.
[01:45:06.023 --> 01:45:11.786]  Now they have tried to suppress gold, which a lot of experts say is valued well over a thousand dollars with inflation or even higher.
[01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:15.248]  Do you think they've genuinely lost control?
[01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:26.154]  Because we know they've been trying to buy gold from each other at reduced prices and then posting daily that reduced price globally to drive it down, but it seems like there's a gold rush on now and they can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[01:45:26.474 --> 01:45:28.796]  I think it's the beginning of the loss of control.
[01:45:28.816 --> 01:45:44.928]  I don't think they've lost the control yet because as long as they can, these different central banks, can print currency and impose them on an unsuspecting public and get the public to use those and buy dollar-denominated assets and other paper promises, as long as they can do that, they can continue to manipulate.
[01:45:45.328 --> 01:45:52.534]  But when that game is up, when everybody says, you know, this paper, these paper promises are worthless, we're not doing this anymore, then the game's over.
[01:45:53.855 --> 01:45:56.920]  So you think they're in real danger of their system gyrating out of control?
[01:45:57.761 --> 01:45:59.243]  I think it's starting to go that way.
[01:45:59.383 --> 01:46:01.406]  Certainly more and more people are getting informed.
[01:46:01.426 --> 01:46:02.648]  The internet's been a big help.
[01:46:02.688 --> 01:46:05.212]  Shows like yours letting the public know is a big help.
[01:46:05.652 --> 01:46:08.457]  But they haven't completely lost control yet because
[01:46:09.117 --> 01:46:15.761]  All of the central banks in the world, they don't want the dollar to just collapse because they've got dollar-denominated assets.
[01:46:15.801 --> 01:46:19.523]  They want to get out of theirs before everybody else catches on.
[01:46:19.924 --> 01:46:21.184]  So they're out of theirs.
[01:46:21.224 --> 01:46:27.128]  They've taken their worthless paper and bought tangible assets and resources while the public has no idea what's going on.
[01:46:27.148 --> 01:46:29.069]  They're still buying T-bills and Treasury bonds.
[01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:39.339]  That's why there's wild buying by the Spanish family of our roads and water districts, and Germans buying everything up, and Japanese, and UAE.
[01:46:40.019 --> 01:46:43.262]  Well, they're privatizing what used to be public resources.
[01:46:43.302 --> 01:46:47.106]  They're privatizing them now, and these rich families are getting control of them.
[01:46:47.746 --> 01:46:56.473]  Now, let me get your view on investments because, I mean, obviously real estate is overvalued in most areas of the country, but at least there's something real, tangible, real land.
[01:46:56.493 --> 01:46:59.976]  It may go down for a while, but it will go back up later.
[01:47:00.316 --> 01:47:01.697]  So I see them demonize real estate.
[01:47:02.137 --> 01:47:03.638]  Meanwhile, they're grabbing it with both hands.
[01:47:03.939 --> 01:47:05.099]  I see them demonize gold.
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:05.820]  Oh, don't buy it.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:06.400]  It's stupid.
[01:47:07.201 --> 01:47:09.403]  Meanwhile, they're buying it up with both hands.
[01:47:09.423 --> 01:47:12.125]  I mean, do you think real estate is a good investment?
[01:47:12.145 --> 01:47:13.406]  Or buy real estate once it plunges?
[01:47:16.648 --> 01:47:22.354]  Well, see, I think right now the real estate prices are at an inflated bubble, so I don't know if it's a good purchase.
[01:47:22.394 --> 01:47:34.086]  I think if you've already got it... See, the people that are in trouble with real estate are the ones that are leveraged too highly, and now if the prices of real estate plunge 10 or 20 or 30 percent,
[01:47:35.947 --> 01:47:36.708]  I think so.
[01:47:52.296 --> 01:47:53.297]  So that's not a problem.
[01:47:53.317 --> 01:48:08.267]  The problem is going to be for the people that bought at inflated prices, borrowed at 100% or 95% of the debt, and now they can't make their mortgage payment two months in a row, and the bank comes in, they lent them credit out of thin air, but they're going to get a house now, a tangible asset.
[01:48:09.347 --> 01:48:11.649]  What about people who are just sitting on a bunch of cash?
[01:48:12.754 --> 01:48:21.803]  Well, I started, and I put my money where my mouth is, three and a half years ago, I started buying gold and silver coins and silver bullion.
[01:48:22.363 --> 01:48:25.506]  I bought a lot of silver when it was $4.88 an ounce.
[01:48:25.686 --> 01:48:27.028]  And now it's $13 plus.
[01:48:27.048 --> 01:48:33.294]  Well, yesterday it reached $14.66, and I tripled my investment in three and a half years.
[01:48:33.454 --> 01:48:36.036]  No, I bought silver at like $5, at $6, at $7, at $8, at $10.
[01:48:38.098 --> 01:48:38.479]  Yes, I do.
[01:48:55.915 --> 01:49:01.797]  Bullion, and it's a good idea to do it in coinage, because that can become a good medium of exchange.
[01:49:01.837 --> 01:49:07.099]  If you have a hundred ounce or a thousand ounce bullion bar, you can sell it, but you can't really use it to buy things.
[01:49:07.139 --> 01:49:09.800]  Oh no, it's great to have them in small, in fact, smaller than ounce coins.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.701]  Right, right, small units, so you can use it.
[01:49:11.721 --> 01:49:12.761]  Tenth of an ounce, quarter ounce.
[01:49:13.161 --> 01:49:18.863]  Right, because if the economy collapses, the day could come when people say, we don't want your paper.
[01:49:19.463 --> 01:49:22.744]  And you're going to have to have something to exchange with them if you want to get food to eat.
[01:49:23.145 --> 01:49:24.385]  That could possibly happen.
[01:49:25.251 --> 01:49:26.852]  Guns are also a good investment.
[01:49:26.932 --> 01:49:28.514]  Most of my guns have doubled in value.
[01:49:28.634 --> 01:49:29.174]  Absolutely.
[01:49:29.234 --> 01:49:31.296]  And ammunition, because they're going to make that harder to get.
[01:49:31.876 --> 01:49:32.637]  They already are.
[01:49:33.958 --> 01:49:36.440]  I want to take a few calls in the next segment and the segment after that.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.282]  I want to keep you with us with Mark Stevens.
[01:49:38.382 --> 01:49:39.743]  If that's okay, you got time to do that, Doc?
[01:49:39.763 --> 01:49:39.903]  Sure.
[01:49:40.544 --> 01:49:40.824]  Great.
[01:49:41.304 --> 01:49:44.507]  It's just amazing information.
[01:49:44.807 --> 01:49:46.088]  We'll take a few calls after this break.
[01:49:46.108 --> 01:49:46.508]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:46.528 --> 01:49:46.568]  800-259-9231.
[01:49:55.293 --> 01:49:58.136]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.397 --> 01:49:59.979]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.339 --> 01:50:05.005]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.345 --> 01:50:12.073]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.393 --> 01:50:14.395]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.595 --> 01:50:17.437]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.517 --> 01:50:22.200]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.401 --> 01:50:26.784]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:27.044 --> 01:50:34.270]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:36.932]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:37.092 --> 01:50:38.833]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:54.309 --> 01:50:56.270]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:50:56.350 --> 01:51:07.074]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:07.434 --> 01:51:11.976]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:12.036 --> 01:51:23.380]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:30.805]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:31.205 --> 01:51:33.346]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:33.827 --> 01:51:38.810]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:51:39.110 --> 01:51:45.254]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.274 --> 01:51:46.395]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[01:51:46.435 --> 01:51:47.316]  That's toll free!
[01:51:47.336 --> 01:51:47.376]  888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:54.100]  I think so.
[01:52:11.463 --> 01:52:12.123]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.988 --> 01:52:44.076]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:44.236 --> 01:52:50.111]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:04.386 --> 01:53:05.907]  Information is power.
[01:53:05.967 --> 01:53:09.850]  Information is one of the most important currencies out there.
[01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:11.552]  And that's what we traffic in.
[01:53:11.592 --> 01:53:12.252]  That's what we do.
[01:53:12.332 --> 01:53:13.313]  It's the information war.
[01:53:13.533 --> 01:53:23.601]  And I challenge every single one of you out there that hasn't gotten my... I think my most important film, Martial Law, or Road to Tyranny, or my new film, The Order of Death.
[01:53:23.681 --> 01:53:24.182]  It is excellent.
[01:53:24.202 --> 01:53:26.203]  You get a free film with it when you order that.
[01:53:26.343 --> 01:53:31.968]  You get The Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, 2005 update and upgraded when you get the new film, Order of Death.
[01:53:33.163 --> 01:53:42.960]  These are all so important, the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the books on tape, the DVDs that we carry on the online video and bookstore shopping cart at InfoWars.com
[01:53:44.523 --> 01:53:48.344]  Or simply call toll-free and they can answer all your questions and take your order.
[01:53:48.364 --> 01:53:49.124]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:53:50.025 --> 01:53:53.946]  Give them a call.
[01:53:54.306 --> 01:53:54.846]  Get the films.
[01:53:54.866 --> 01:53:56.526]  You're authorized to make copies of my films.
[01:53:56.546 --> 01:54:00.708]  You're not authorized to make copies of the other films and books of other offers we carry.
[01:54:01.468 --> 01:54:02.788]  But be sure and get theirs as well.
[01:54:02.828 --> 01:54:04.329]  And you know, buy originals.
[01:54:04.569 --> 01:54:05.069]  Give them to people.
[01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:08.090]  But when you get mine, I'm not doing you a favor.
[01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:11.390]  I'm begging you to make copies of them.
[01:54:11.591 --> 01:54:12.931]  If you already have the films,
[01:54:13.951 --> 01:54:14.772]  Make copies of them.
[01:54:14.812 --> 01:54:15.412]  Get them out to people.
[01:54:15.432 --> 01:54:16.493]  Air them on AXS TV.
[01:54:16.993 --> 01:54:18.354]  This is how we're having an effect.
[01:54:18.374 --> 01:54:19.354]  We're having a huge effect.
[01:54:19.374 --> 01:54:20.055]  So take action.
[01:54:20.655 --> 01:54:28.959]  That toll-free number 1-888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com to order hard copies.
[01:54:28.999 --> 01:54:30.280]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.721]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:54:32.081 --> 01:54:33.342]  15 cents a day for a monthly subscription.
[01:54:33.382 --> 01:54:33.762]  Even less.
[01:54:34.182 --> 01:54:38.444]  for a yearly subscription and all the films are there, just so much is there.
[01:54:38.524 --> 01:54:39.905]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:40.245 --> 01:54:43.947]  Bill, I know these calls will be all over the map, but that's okay, because you can speak to all of it.
[01:54:43.967 --> 01:54:45.128]  I've heard you on the radio do that.
[01:54:45.528 --> 01:54:48.910]  Mike in Ohio, you're on the air, then Sean, Peggy, and others.
[01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:49.850]  Mike, welcome.
[01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:51.131]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:54:51.291 --> 01:54:51.631]  Good, sir.
[01:54:52.692 --> 01:54:58.054]  I'd just like to say thank you, first off, for doing what you're doing, because you are educating a lot of people.
[01:54:58.555 --> 01:55:02.937]  And I can imagine how hard it is to try to get people to understand
[01:55:03.382 --> 01:55:07.766]  How bad of a shape we really are in this country, because we really are in bad shape.
[01:55:08.107 --> 01:55:13.352]  Well, if you think it's bad now, we're just cruising in towards the tarmac and just wait until we crash.
[01:55:14.113 --> 01:55:19.298]  And I'd also like to thank Charlie Sheen, because he really, really helped a lot.
[01:55:19.798 --> 01:55:21.981]  I was hoping that more stars would come out.
[01:55:22.648 --> 01:55:24.829]  Keep the, you know, keep the wave going.
[01:55:25.029 --> 01:55:26.249]  Well, I mean... Even in the public eye.
[01:55:26.329 --> 01:55:28.890]  Ed Asner did, and there's a bunch of others who are just afraid, too.
[01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:30.150]  They're gonna see what happens to Charlie.
[01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:42.013]  Um, and I wanted to bring up one point that I haven't heard you mention today, and that was, uh, last night on MSNBC on the, uh, Rita Cosby Show, they interviewed Josh Nichols, the son of, uh, Terry Nichols.
[01:55:42.773 --> 01:55:43.073]  Yes.
[01:55:43.213 --> 01:55:46.214]  Saying that there's more people involved in Oklahoma City?
[01:55:46.434 --> 01:55:46.674]  Yeah.
[01:55:47.114 --> 01:55:48.975]  And I was just wondering what your opinion on that was.
[01:55:49.488 --> 01:55:50.830]  Well, we know their names.
[01:55:51.491 --> 01:55:53.954]  They were Iraqi Republican Guard hired by the U.S.
[01:55:53.975 --> 01:55:55.777]  government at least to play the part of decoys.
[01:55:56.378 --> 01:55:58.421]  They were arrested and ordered released by Bill Clinton.
[01:55:58.461 --> 01:55:59.903]  The federal government bombed OKC.
[01:56:00.123 --> 01:56:00.864]  There's no debating it.
[01:56:01.205 --> 01:56:03.388]  I spent 45 minutes on that in my film Road to Tyranny.
[01:56:03.408 --> 01:56:04.950]  Bill, you want to comment on OKC?
[01:56:07.663 --> 01:56:08.784]  I don't think I have any more to add.
[01:56:08.824 --> 01:56:11.126]  You've done so much more research on that than I have.
[01:56:11.246 --> 01:56:12.768]  I yield to you on that subject.
[01:56:13.088 --> 01:56:13.409]  What about 9-11?
[01:56:13.429 --> 01:56:14.490]  You want to comment on that?
[01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:23.279]  Well, I think anybody that believes the official version has not spent one minute doing any independent research.
[01:56:23.419 --> 01:56:31.787]  Yes, so many people since Shane went public thought he was crazy and went and looked it up, and he's getting literally hundreds of letters and emails, but people don't even know his address, he's still getting it.
[01:56:32.187 --> 01:56:36.091]  And his parents are getting letters, everybody he knows are getting letters, and it's almost all positive.
[01:56:36.111 --> 01:56:38.653]  And it's, I didn't believe you, I checked it out, it's true, oh my God.
[01:56:38.913 --> 01:56:40.295]  Great, I'm glad to hear that.
[01:56:40.415 --> 01:56:44.118]  And some of these are really prominent people, I can't say any names, but it's waking up others.
[01:56:44.218 --> 01:56:44.418]  Good.
[01:56:45.139 --> 01:56:46.100]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:56:46.681 --> 01:56:48.442]  Let's talk to Sean in New Hampshire.
[01:56:48.482 --> 01:56:49.123]  Sean, go ahead.
[01:56:49.881 --> 01:56:51.502]  Hi Alex, great to be on your show again.
[01:56:52.442 --> 01:57:04.569]  I wanted to let you and your listeners know that in New Hampshire we aren't laying down to this police state and on Saturday 11 to 1 p.m.
[01:57:05.269 --> 01:57:19.097]  the Granite Staters are getting together to support our law that's coming up to not obey the Real ID Act and you can get information on that at www.granitestateid.com and to your author
[01:57:20.838 --> 01:57:27.541]  The Federal Reserve started to stop reporting on the M3 money supply a few months ago.
[01:57:27.821 --> 01:57:28.381]  Stay there, caller.
[01:57:28.401 --> 01:57:29.141]  I'll let you finish up.
[01:57:29.381 --> 01:57:32.883]  We're going to be back with a third hour in 70 seconds.
[01:57:33.843 --> 01:57:38.485]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:50.650]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.311 --> 01:57:52.392]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.072 --> 01:57:54.193]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.834 --> 01:57:55.655]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.435 --> 01:57:57.276]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.296 --> 01:58:01.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:06.304]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.705 --> 01:58:08.566]  We're now into the third hour.
[01:58:08.586 --> 01:58:11.509]  Hey, it just goes by quick with all the great folks we're interviewing today.
[01:58:13.041 --> 01:58:15.482]  And Bill Vieth, Dr. Bill Vieth, is my guest.
[01:58:15.862 --> 01:58:21.045]  Coming up in about five minutes, he'll continue to ride shotgun with us, but we'll have Mark Stevens of the No State Project joining us.
[01:58:21.825 --> 01:58:24.526]  And we're also now carrying his book, Adventures in Legal Land.
[01:58:24.546 --> 01:58:28.008]  It had been a few years since I had him on, and a caller called in and said, It's a conspiracy!
[01:58:28.028 --> 01:58:28.988]  You won't have him on!
[01:58:29.028 --> 01:58:29.668]  You never have!
[01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:31.769]  I said, No, I like Mark.
[01:58:31.789 --> 01:58:32.550]  We'll have him back on.
[01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:34.651]  Thanks for inviting me, even though it was viciously.
[01:58:35.711 --> 01:58:37.112]  So that's coming up.
[01:58:37.492 --> 01:58:39.953]  But the caller just raised the point of
[01:58:41.093 --> 01:58:42.774]  Inflating the money supply.
[01:58:42.794 --> 01:58:51.256]  The Federal Reserve since 1913 has always told us how much money they're printing in digits on a ballot sheet, and also in fiat paper currency.
[01:58:51.636 --> 01:58:57.158]  Now they're saying, hey, we're not going to have any reporting to you, and that's one reason that the gold's exploding.
[01:58:57.258 --> 01:58:57.758]  Tell us about it.
[01:58:59.077 --> 01:59:06.140]  Well, on March 20th they stopped, as a caller said, publishing the M3 number.
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:13.062]  And that's the number that lets us know how many fiat dollars in paper and electronic digits are in circulation in the world.
[01:59:13.682 --> 01:59:18.244]  And, you know, there has been some information circulating on the internet saying that Bernanke is
[01:59:19.238 --> 01:59:21.041]  Printing two trillion more dollars.
[01:59:21.061 --> 01:59:21.942]  That's the new Fed Chief.
[01:59:22.122 --> 01:59:22.382]  Right.
[01:59:22.462 --> 01:59:31.154]  So if that's the case, it's just, you know, even though they're not printing the number, the world, the effect is the world is acting like they are printing two trillion dollars.
[01:59:31.174 --> 01:59:33.898]  And that's why the commodity prices have exploded since March 20th.
[01:59:34.278 --> 01:59:36.659]  And nothing in intelligence is really secret.
[01:59:36.679 --> 01:59:45.180]  They can make the decision in a smoky back room or in some underground base or in some cabin when they're having a roundtable meeting, but we see the implementation of it.
[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:47.941]  We see the commodities across the board start exploding.
[01:59:48.181 --> 01:59:51.161]  We know what that real number is because the insiders know that.
[01:59:51.662 --> 01:59:56.363]  I've been saying conservatively gold will go to a thousand, but you've done the math, doctor.
[01:59:56.383 --> 01:59:58.463]  You were saying twenty-one plus hundred dollars per ounce?
[01:59:58.743 --> 02:00:05.967]  Right, well, back in 1980, gold hit about $850 an ounce before they started really manipulating the gold price downward.
[02:00:06.607 --> 02:00:10.929]  And $850 in 1980 dollars is equivalent to $2150 today, so gold would have to reach a price today of $2150 just to be equivalent to what it reached 26 years ago.
[02:00:21.861 --> 02:00:23.382]  Again, these numbers have been looked at.
[02:00:23.422 --> 02:00:27.085]  Even mainstream financial publications are saying gold could hit $2,500.
[02:00:27.765 --> 02:00:28.946]  I'm trying to be conservative.
[02:00:29.426 --> 02:00:37.632]  I told people 5, 6, 7, 10 years ago when gold was $250 an ounce, just 4 years ago, and I said, buy it because it's not fiat.
[02:00:37.672 --> 02:00:38.773]  It may go up, it may go down.
[02:00:38.813 --> 02:00:41.095]  I think it will go up, but at least you've got something real.
[02:00:41.415 --> 02:00:42.416]  Look at the stock market.
[02:00:42.436 --> 02:00:44.057]  It's been down, now it's been back up.
[02:00:45.058 --> 02:00:46.138]  People are making 4 or 5% on their money.
[02:00:47.279 --> 02:00:53.484]  I mean, if they make good investments, and with the Dow Jones 30 industrial average, they only keep the winners in there.
[02:00:53.504 --> 02:00:54.484]  They take the losers out.
[02:00:54.504 --> 02:00:56.866]  They take the losers out of the S&P.
[02:00:56.906 --> 02:00:58.107]  They take the losers and winners.
[02:00:58.127 --> 02:01:00.529]  I mean, it's total cookbooks.
[02:01:00.949 --> 02:01:06.313]  Well, not only that, Alex, but let's say the stock market stays at $11,000 for the last four years.
[02:01:06.373 --> 02:01:07.314]  It's been right around there.
[02:01:07.934 --> 02:01:17.139]  If the purchasing power of the dollar has gone down over 40% and the number $11,000 stays the same, well, the stock market value has dropped 40%.
[02:01:17.179 --> 02:01:18.060]  It hasn't held its own.
[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:19.361]  It's really at the equivalent of about $6,500.
[02:01:20.581 --> 02:01:21.182]  Exactly.
[02:01:21.462 --> 02:01:21.842]  Exactly.
[02:01:21.862 --> 02:01:23.423]  And that's what people don't understand.
[02:01:25.049 --> 02:01:26.591]  Is it frustrating?
[02:01:26.671 --> 02:01:28.814]  I don't feel like I'm some normal guy.
[02:01:28.854 --> 02:01:30.837]  This isn't hard to understand.
[02:01:30.897 --> 02:01:35.302]  I know so many prominent, even wealthy people who think they're a part of the elite.
[02:01:35.322 --> 02:01:36.444]  They don't even understand this.
[02:01:37.024 --> 02:01:37.445]  Not at all.
[02:01:37.485 --> 02:01:39.888]  They don't understand it at all and it is very frustrating.
[02:01:40.829 --> 02:01:42.711]  You know, they don't want to put the time in it.
[02:01:42.791 --> 02:01:45.994]  You know, it's kind of like, they call it cognitive dissonance.
[02:01:46.074 --> 02:01:52.920]  In psychology, there's a paradigm that we call the assimilation-accommodation model of information processing.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.061]  Is that rationalization?
[02:01:54.381 --> 02:01:56.623]  Well, no, it's not exactly.
[02:01:56.963 --> 02:02:03.349]  What the accommodation model is, is it says that with a lot of people, they have a mental paradigm in their mind of how something works.
[02:02:03.889 --> 02:02:07.592]  And they can easily assimilate information that fits the paradigm.
[02:02:07.972 --> 02:02:15.138]  But if they get novel information that doesn't fit the paradigm, they can't accommodate the paradigm to accept the new information.
[02:02:15.158 --> 02:02:16.639]  So they just reject the information.
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:21.904]  Oh, is that where the sailing ships would pull up in the Americas and the natives couldn't even recognize the ships?
[02:02:22.104 --> 02:02:22.924]  Right, same principle.
[02:02:22.944 --> 02:02:24.185]  Because they'd never seen it before.
[02:02:24.246 --> 02:02:24.946]  Same principle.
[02:02:25.326 --> 02:02:25.907]  Same principle.
[02:02:25.967 --> 02:02:28.469]  If they can't, the model won't accommodate the information.
[02:02:29.142 --> 02:02:29.462]  So that's
[02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:47.170]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.351 --> 02:02:50.434]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.574 --> 02:02:54.477]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.517 --> 02:02:58.761]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:59.102 --> 02:03:02.885]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:03.005 --> 02:03:04.867]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.007 --> 02:03:08.351]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.371 --> 02:03:09.472]  The medical bills!
[02:03:11.033 --> 02:03:13.055]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.215 --> 02:03:16.259]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.439 --> 02:03:19.342]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.802 --> 02:03:25.909]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.449 --> 02:03:30.230]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:03:47.208 --> 02:03:51.331]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.451 --> 02:03:54.333]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.413 --> 02:04:01.138]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.298 --> 02:04:04.321]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.521 --> 02:04:06.902]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:07.043 --> 02:04:11.766]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:04:11.946 --> 02:04:26.513]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are Extracted.

[02:04:45.603 --> 02:04:52.465]  For months now you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:04:52.625 --> 02:05:05.530]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobeys, Mystic and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:05:05.730 --> 02:05:06.510]  Are you sick of barely
[02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:07.531]  Are you really having enough money?
[02:05:07.691 --> 02:05:11.153]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:05:11.433 --> 02:05:15.215]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:05:15.476 --> 02:05:20.459]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:05:20.719 --> 02:05:22.420]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:28.764]  To create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions, Dango is what you are looking for!

[02:05:45.385 --> 02:05:50.428]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.788 --> 02:05:53.110]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.611 --> 02:06:03.916]  Every week or so, we add the best videos and books to the Infowars.com online video and book store.
[02:06:04.884 --> 02:06:10.430]  There's also Citizen Rule books and t-shirts and bumper stickers and things up there on the site as well at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:11.211 --> 02:06:18.018]  Mark Stevens is going to be joining us in just one moment after I finish up something here with Bill Vieth who's in the studio and will be riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:06:18.439 --> 02:06:21.022]  We're honored to have him.
[02:06:21.122 --> 02:06:24.125]  Mark Stevens' book, I read it a couple years ago and he's got an updated version.
[02:06:24.245 --> 02:06:25.767]  It's Adventures in Legal Land.
[02:06:26.267 --> 02:06:32.753]  And it just gets into the criminality of the courts, the general craziness, and he's here to talk about his book with us today.
[02:06:32.793 --> 02:06:41.421]  And near the end of the hour I want to get some into his view of there just no state is legitimate and we can debate that and go over that because I believe that you're always going to have some type of state.
[02:06:41.901 --> 02:06:45.482]  Because you're always going to have rogue criminal groups that try to set up a state.
[02:06:45.842 --> 02:06:51.543]  So we need to be able to set up some type of limited, even if it's a free market, voluntary state to control and restrict those folks.
[02:06:51.563 --> 02:06:57.024]  And I know Mark has some views on that that I think are revolutionary and very informative.
[02:06:57.764 --> 02:07:00.185]  But Bill, during the break we were talking about your family.
[02:07:00.225 --> 02:07:09.367]  You told them three years ago, and you just woke up, you've been a conservative for many years, we've helped fight gun laws and stuff here in Texas together, because we're liberal, we're pro-guns, we're liberal under the Bush paradigm.
[02:07:11.648 --> 02:07:22.517]  But some of your family, I guess, wasn't fully believing you, but three plus years ago you convinced them to get gold and silver, and boy, I bet you've really got some converts now because their investments have more than doubled with silver.
[02:07:22.577 --> 02:07:24.259]  Is it tripling or quadrupling?
[02:07:24.299 --> 02:07:25.560]  Tripling since we purchased.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.383]  I did it three and a half years ago.
[02:07:29.663 --> 02:07:40.252]  I took every piece of paper I had, whether it was a stock, a bond, or a Federal Reserve note, or a CD, and I cashed them all in and I started purchasing gold and silver coin.
[02:07:40.813 --> 02:07:42.984]  And I took physical possession and they are hidden.
[02:07:43.004 --> 02:07:44.914]  They are buried under the ground somewhere.
[02:07:45.496 --> 02:07:45.916]  Same here.
[02:07:46.237 --> 02:07:49.880]  And I don't care what happens with the paper market.
[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:52.042]  That's right, there's not one shekel in my house.
[02:07:52.122 --> 02:07:52.662]  Right, no.
[02:07:53.062 --> 02:07:54.143]  It's hidden and it's safe.
[02:07:54.343 --> 02:07:55.925]  By the way, safety deposit boxes aren't safe.
[02:07:56.045 --> 02:07:56.765]  No, not at all.
[02:07:56.966 --> 02:07:59.588]  What did Long, Young & Silver know that the American people don't know?
[02:07:59.988 --> 02:08:03.851]  I mean, they changed laws under the Patriot Act to immediately take what's in your box.
[02:08:03.871 --> 02:08:04.292]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:08:04.392 --> 02:08:05.773]  Absolutely, they did that in 1933.
[02:08:06.373 --> 02:08:14.180]  A member of the government would accompany people to their safe deposit box and they'd take out the gold and guns, basically.
[02:08:14.833 --> 02:08:17.394]  And so no, you've got to take physical possession.
[02:08:17.434 --> 02:08:20.895]  I mean, you can't even buy a gold or a silver stock.
[02:08:20.935 --> 02:08:34.080]  You've got to buy it physical and take physical possession because the way they have suppressed the prices of gold and silver and manipulated prices downward over the years is by selling paper contracts for gold and silver.
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:37.241]  Well, that's how the Rothschilds took control in Europe starting 300 years ago.
[02:08:37.281 --> 02:08:38.502]  They were just local goldsmiths.
[02:08:38.522 --> 02:08:39.983]  That was the pawn dealer.
[02:08:40.003 --> 02:08:40.963]  This is historical fact.
[02:08:54.669 --> 02:09:01.794]  And the local nobles would drop by and put in a ring or a pile of gold, and they would give them, quote, a seatch.
[02:09:02.134 --> 02:09:05.516]  Well, they learned very quickly that they could loan out five, ten, fifteen, twenty times.
[02:09:05.536 --> 02:09:07.358]  Their rule is normally one to ten.
[02:09:08.278 --> 02:09:09.939]  They usually get caught if they go higher.
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.821]  Now they've gone higher, and that's all this system is.
[02:09:12.861 --> 02:09:14.162]  Imagine, they're the goldsmith.
[02:09:14.422 --> 02:09:22.368]  They issue the paper, and now they've just gotten rid of the gold entirely, and then tell us, oh, don't have gold, while they're privately buying gold for themselves.
[02:09:22.648 --> 02:09:23.168]  Comments on that?
[02:09:24.909 --> 02:09:30.931]  Yeah, this has been going on for years and years, and that was the beginning of the fractional reserve banking system.
[02:09:30.991 --> 02:09:33.891]  I mean, our Federal Reserve didn't invent this system.
[02:09:34.151 --> 02:09:38.633]  They just looked back in history and saw what had been done in the past and repeated it.
[02:09:39.253 --> 02:09:39.873]  Absolutely.
[02:09:40.113 --> 02:09:42.053]  Stay with us, Dr. Bill Vieth.
[02:09:42.113 --> 02:09:49.355]  Let's go to Mark Stevens, The No State Project, and we are carrying his book, Adventures in Legal Land, up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:09:49.395 --> 02:09:49.895]  It's a doozy.
[02:09:50.236 --> 02:09:51.896]  Mark, thank you for spending time with us today.
[02:09:52.529 --> 02:09:53.670]  Oh, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:09:54.110 --> 02:09:54.490]  You bet it.
[02:09:54.591 --> 02:09:57.152]  It's been about two or three years since I had you on last.
[02:09:57.232 --> 02:09:59.894]  I want to do it at least once a year, not every three years.
[02:10:00.314 --> 02:10:01.916]  It's good to have you here with us.
[02:10:02.356 --> 02:10:09.721]  You're hearing us have this discussion of banking systems, of fractional reserve banking, of why gold and oil and silver is exploding.
[02:10:09.741 --> 02:10:11.862]  It's because they're not up, it's just the dollar is down.
[02:10:12.163 --> 02:10:13.283]  That value is still the same.
[02:10:13.303 --> 02:10:14.064]  You want to comment on that?
[02:10:15.861 --> 02:10:19.023]  Well, the whole problem extends from government.
[02:10:19.383 --> 02:10:27.066]  If you didn't have government, then the Federal Reserve and systems and the manipulation of the monetary system, if you will, couldn't take place.
[02:10:27.526 --> 02:10:30.247]  It's only because of government that you have such abuses.
[02:10:30.427 --> 02:10:39.311]  You take government out of the picture, and in a voluntary society, you can have a bunch of idiots put worthless pieces of paper on the market, and people would have the
[02:10:39.913 --> 02:10:44.294]  Able to either accept it or not, and obviously, you know, idiots like that will go out of business.
[02:10:44.414 --> 02:10:47.115]  But it's because of government, and government is the base problem.
[02:10:48.196 --> 02:10:49.176]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:10:49.196 --> 02:10:51.457]  The problem is, is that they've confused all the terms.
[02:10:51.557 --> 02:11:00.959]  Now, of the 100 biggest economies, 40 plus of them, what, 44 of them are corporations, and they're acting in a governmental way, and then fake conservatives confuse people and go, yeah, we agree with Mark Stevens.
[02:11:01.300 --> 02:11:05.721]  We want privatization, hand everything over to them, but then they just operate as governments.
[02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:13.197]  Well, corporations have the same... The reason why corporations do what they're doing... They're chartered by the government.
[02:11:13.657 --> 02:11:14.558]  They're chartered by government.
[02:11:14.779 --> 02:11:16.481]  They have no personal accountability.
[02:11:17.232 --> 02:11:19.833]  Usually, there's almost no personal liability whatsoever.
[02:11:20.154 --> 02:11:25.276]  Occasionally, you'll get something where they so-called pierce the corporate bail, but they typically don't.
[02:11:25.776 --> 02:11:29.698]  They work hand-in-hand with government to, of course, plunder and rape people.
[02:11:30.038 --> 02:11:33.380]  I want to start... I mean, I've kind of brought us to the end here at the start.
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:35.341]  Start with how you woke up, who you are.
[02:11:35.701 --> 02:11:40.163]  Tell us about your book, and then I want to first get into just the insane criminality of the courts.
[02:11:40.183 --> 02:11:44.285]  I mean, here's one example after you tell us about yourself, for those who don't know who you are, who've been hiding under a rock.
[02:11:45.686 --> 02:11:58.191]  Two weeks ago, Rocky Mountain News State Judge says, I don't care if this 16-year-old didn't break a law, photographing himself with a gun, because his dad's a gun collector, and then someone saw the picture.
[02:11:58.691 --> 02:12:00.752]  It doesn't matter if he's allowed to have the gun in his house.
[02:12:00.792 --> 02:12:02.513]  It doesn't matter if he didn't threaten anybody.
[02:12:02.773 --> 02:12:03.954]  He's been in jail for two months.
[02:12:04.074 --> 02:12:06.095]  I'm convicting him and keeping him in jail for years.
[02:12:06.515 --> 02:12:09.096]  And the judge just said, I don't need a law anymore to put you in jail.
[02:12:09.296 --> 02:12:10.377]  Or, people aren't even
[02:12:11.434 --> 02:12:24.752]  People aren't even indicted or charged yet in the case of them arresting two quote drug dealers and they're taking them to the dentist to rip out their gold fillings out of their mouth, their gold crowns.
[02:12:26.254 --> 02:12:29.696]  You're trying to steal people's teeth before even charges have been made.
[02:12:29.836 --> 02:12:32.839]  Are those not two examples of government total criminality?
[02:12:32.899 --> 02:12:42.465]  Bush saying he's above the law on torture, Bush saying he's above the law on the NSA, Bush saying he's above the law... He signed a bill a month ago that hadn't even passed, a two billion dollar spending bill.
[02:12:42.485 --> 02:12:44.547]  I mean, we've entered Twilight Zone La La Land.
[02:12:45.107 --> 02:12:45.607]  Go ahead.
[02:12:45.687 --> 02:12:53.033]  Well, it's the above the law mentality that led me to realize there was no state and that there is no such thing as a legitimate government, ever.
[02:12:53.333 --> 02:12:54.814]  Because I was researching into
[02:12:55.763 --> 02:12:59.047]  This absolute immunity that judges are supposed to have.
[02:12:59.407 --> 02:13:06.595]  And what I found in cases like, I quote in the book, Bowers v. Vito, and there's hundreds of these, that the government has no duty to protect anybody.
[02:13:07.208 --> 02:13:09.490]  Whether it's state, local, federal, it doesn't matter.
[02:13:10.411 --> 02:13:11.512]  No duty to protect.
[02:13:11.912 --> 02:13:19.459]  And I look and the only thing that makes somebody a citizen is a duty of allegiance in return for a duty of protection at their reciprocal obligations.
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:28.047]  Well, if there's no duty to protect, it struck me that then there's no duty of allegiance, there are no citizens, and the whole thing started to collapse from there.
[02:13:29.008 --> 02:13:30.289]  And I've gone into court,
[02:13:31.414 --> 02:13:38.303]  And I, based on that information, not that I've gone into court with a lot, I know a lot of people that go in and they, they don't understand that the state doesn't exist, it's a fiction.
[02:13:38.804 --> 02:13:39.945]  I don't take a position.
[02:13:39.965 --> 02:13:44.050]  I would go in and ask a simple question such as, is there evidence of a complaining party?
[02:13:45.112 --> 02:13:46.634]  Which is a standard legal question.
[02:13:47.919 --> 02:13:51.682]  And not one prosecutor, judge, lawyer, cop, none of them could ever answer.
[02:13:51.963 --> 02:13:53.984]  None of them would actually say yes or no to me.
[02:13:54.445 --> 02:14:02.732]  Well, before we get into all these legal theories and ideas, which I agree with you on most of your stances on your research, go back to how Mark Stevens woke up.
[02:14:04.699 --> 02:14:15.662]  Well, not to go into too big a case, I was in a traffic case for failure to produce identification, which that tells you right there you've got a serious problem that you're not in a free society.
[02:14:15.742 --> 02:14:21.263]  Hundreds of times federal and state courts have ruled you don't have to ID, but still they arrest people every day for it.
[02:14:21.863 --> 02:14:23.104]  Well, you have Brown v. Texas.
[02:14:23.564 --> 02:14:31.426]  Brown v. Texas makes it clear, unanimous Supreme Court decision, you don't have to show police identification unless it's probable cause that you are engaged in a crime.
[02:14:31.446 --> 02:14:32.786]  And that's an Austin, Texas case.
[02:14:34.176 --> 02:14:35.778]  Yeah, and it's 9-0!
[02:14:36.398 --> 02:14:41.223]  Go ask any legal scholar, any lead constitutional lawyer, a son-in-law of the Supreme Court.
[02:14:41.403 --> 02:14:43.385]  How many 9-0 decisions are there from the U.S.
[02:14:43.405 --> 02:14:43.945]  Supreme Court?
[02:14:44.606 --> 02:14:45.647]  There's only a handful.
[02:14:46.047 --> 02:14:46.948]  So they ignore it.
[02:14:47.088 --> 02:14:53.374]  And so what happened was I read Brown v. I mean, I impeached all five police officers against me that testified.
[02:14:53.454 --> 02:14:57.498]  The judge said, you can impeach all your witnesses, they're a bunch of liars,
[02:14:58.229 --> 02:15:04.135]  He still convicted me, and I figured, well, the last thing I have is Brown vs. Texas, and I read it, and the guy sneers down at me.
[02:15:04.635 --> 02:15:05.856]  That's your interpretation.
[02:15:05.876 --> 02:15:07.037]  And I was floored.
[02:15:07.077 --> 02:15:08.118]  I didn't know where else to go.
[02:15:08.699 --> 02:15:15.585]  So what happened was, because of that, I started looking at any situation where this guy with the robot has discretion.
[02:15:15.605 --> 02:15:18.908]  Now, discretion means, literally, he can do whatever he wants.
[02:15:18.928 --> 02:15:19.629]  Okay?
[02:15:20.685 --> 02:15:23.866]  And it's the worst word you want to hear if you're in a court case, I think.
[02:15:23.886 --> 02:15:25.107]  In my opinion, anyway.
[02:15:25.127 --> 02:15:26.688]  Yeah, the court's discretion.
[02:15:27.088 --> 02:15:28.468]  And did you see the case two weeks ago?
[02:15:28.508 --> 02:15:32.810]  I see one every day now, where they go, no one was found guilty, but you're going to jail.
[02:15:33.690 --> 02:15:41.693]  How many people know the Davidians, in 94, were found not guilty by the jury, but Walter E. Smith said, I'm putting you all in jail for 47 years.
[02:15:42.854 --> 02:15:48.296]  He said, I find you guilty for using firearms in the commission of murder, when they were found not guilty for murder.
[02:15:49.849 --> 02:15:59.537]  Yeah, they were acquitted on all the charges of murder, that it was a self-defense, and yes, and it's happened here in Phoenix, and it's happened a lot of places, especially a tax case.
[02:15:59.897 --> 02:16:19.032]  There's a famous case here, out of Phoenix, where a man sued Smitty's on his own, won a huge jury settlement, and the judge stood up and said, not in my court, and I actually saw the order from the judge, and it said, whoa, what a tangled web we weave, when unto a lawyer we fail to cleave.
[02:16:19.637 --> 02:16:26.840]  And even though the judge was censored by the Arizona Supreme Court, they never reversed or gave him back his jury decision.
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:29.321]  So, I want people to hear this loud and clear.
[02:16:29.721 --> 02:16:34.003]  People are going to jail and the judge says, no laws have been violated, but I'm sending you to prison.
[02:16:34.083 --> 02:16:35.143]  That is dictatorship.
[02:16:36.004 --> 02:16:39.165]  Well, it gets even worse than that, and I don't know how much time we have in this segment.
[02:16:39.445 --> 02:16:46.608]  What I started looking at was the whole basis of government and the whole basis for the government to bring a case against you, even if they, even if you
[02:16:48.328 --> 02:16:56.054]  Let's say you have drugs, and the law says you're not supposed to have drugs, or you're supposed to file a tax return, and the law says you're supposed to file a tax return.
[02:16:56.475 --> 02:17:01.979]  Even if they can show that, they still don't have a case against you or have standing to complain against you in court.
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:13.409]  And I tried to have on my show, on the No Stay Project, the lead attorney in the EEOC v. Lowry's The Prime Rib Case, where they want to sue, or they are suing,
[02:17:14.244 --> 02:17:20.385]  Lowry's, this company, who's been in business since 1938, because they won't hire male servers.
[02:17:22.406 --> 02:17:24.866]  Stay there, Mark Stevens.
[02:17:24.906 --> 02:17:30.607]  We'll come back and we'll get Bill Vieth to ask you some questions and then just go over just how criminal it is.
[02:17:30.627 --> 02:17:35.208]  Because, look, I know government always tends to go bad and it's always pretty illegitimate unless it's very restricted.
[02:17:35.568 --> 02:17:38.609]  Now it's just pale male wildness.
[02:17:39.489 --> 02:17:41.110]  And it's only going to get worse.
[02:17:41.370 --> 02:17:43.170]  We've hit the point of no return.
[02:17:45.951 --> 02:17:51.921]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:17:58.848 --> 02:18:02.050]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:18:51.375 --> 02:18:52.596]  Currency devaluation.
[02:18:52.936 --> 02:18:53.497]  Inflation.
[02:18:53.957 --> 02:18:54.638]  One and the same.
[02:18:55.378 --> 02:18:59.361]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:59.381 --> 02:19:01.443]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:01.463 --> 02:19:01.963]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:02.003 --> 02:19:03.504]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:03.784 --> 02:19:04.305]  Here is reality.
[02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:20.645]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:21.125 --> 02:19:24.808]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:25.368 --> 02:19:29.111]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[02:20:55.758 --> 02:20:59.321]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[02:20:59.701 --> 02:21:04.564]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:21:04.904 --> 02:21:10.689]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:21:11.009 --> 02:21:14.712]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.

[02:21:52.795 --> 02:21:55.258]  Mark Stevens, Adventures in Legal Land author.
[02:21:55.278 --> 02:21:57.039]  We carry it at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:57.059 --> 02:21:57.760]  Just went up today.
[02:21:57.780 --> 02:21:59.262]  Tell you more about the book later.
[02:22:00.626 --> 02:22:02.927]  Mark, my question of this orgy of looting.
[02:22:03.307 --> 02:22:07.127]  I mean, every indicator is that the government and its minions are going wild.
[02:22:07.307 --> 02:22:19.450]  People don't know that in the New London case, Kelo versus New London up in Connecticut, that they're not even giving people tax value, much less best value or best price.
[02:22:19.890 --> 02:22:24.111]  They're telling them, we're going to give you condemned value, a $300,000 plus house you've been paying taxes on.
[02:22:24.511 --> 02:22:31.958]  Well, that's true because people, I explain this in my seminars at length, because you're talking, if you look at the Stanford Prison Experiment, I agree with you about the prison planet.
[02:22:51.389 --> 02:23:12.206]  Uh, and what I discuss is how the whole world is one big stand-for-prison experiment, where you've got billions of people pretending to be citizens or residents of non-existent states and countries, and you've got a few million people, a couple hundred million people, pretending to be senators and presidents and congressmen and whatnot, and if you go through that experiment, it explains why people
[02:23:12.706 --> 02:23:21.211]  In the United States, so-called, can't get away from this theology called government... And we have a multiple doctorate psychologist here.
[02:23:21.231 --> 02:23:26.734]  For those who don't know what the Stanford experiment was, tell them in a nutshell.
[02:23:27.295 --> 02:23:31.137]  Well, I mean, obviously, in a nutshell... Yeah, Mark, you tell them.
[02:23:31.747 --> 02:23:38.934]  Well, what happened was, in a nutshell, it was a psychological experiment conducted, it was supposed to be two weeks long, where they were doing a mock prison.
[02:23:39.274 --> 02:23:43.718]  Half a group of young men were going to pretend to be prisoners, the other half were going to pretend to be prison guards.
[02:23:43.978 --> 02:23:51.185]  They had to stop the experiment within six days because the psychiatrist doing the experiment said that the guards were becoming sadistic.
[02:23:51.485 --> 02:23:54.408]  He also had what was called de-individuation within 36 hours.
[02:23:56.129 --> 02:24:06.194]  Because what that means in a nutshell is that the people pretending to be prisoners, who knew they were pretending, this is extremely critical, they knew they were pretending and lost their personal identity.
[02:24:06.214 --> 02:24:10.196]  They could only identify themselves as part of the collective group of prisoners.
[02:24:10.876 --> 02:24:17.499]  And that's what you have where people cannot identify themselves as other than citizens or residents of the United States or Texas or whatnot.
[02:24:17.739 --> 02:24:26.568]  There was another famous case where they had them practice giving them electric shocks but told them in a double-blind study you're actually going to kill somebody and they would follow the orders to kill.
[02:24:27.168 --> 02:24:37.278]  That was the Milgram experiment and I have that link on my website and I used those two experiments together to explain the nature and basis of government and the psychological basis why people cannot accept
[02:24:37.904 --> 02:24:38.465]  The truth!
[02:24:38.865 --> 02:24:46.371]  And when you were speaking with the doctor before the break, before I came on, about the cognitive dissonance, that it doesn't fit the paradigm.
[02:24:46.651 --> 02:24:54.938]  People cannot identify that they have a very difficult time accepting that there is no state, there is no United States, there is no such thing as a president, and there are no citizens.
[02:24:56.179 --> 02:24:58.261]  And that's because of the de-individuation.
[02:24:58.301 --> 02:25:02.044]  They've been pretending that they're citizens for so long, they can't
[02:25:03.134 --> 02:25:11.877]  You have to grasp the truth that they are just Alex Jones, or they're just Mark Stevens, and the whole thing that they've been scamming their entire lives.
[02:25:13.078 --> 02:25:16.159]  These two experiments give you the psychological basis for that.
[02:25:16.279 --> 02:25:20.620]  Why is it possible for George Bush and all these other people to murder 3,000 people?
[02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:25.522]  If you look at the Stanford Prison Experiment, within six days of controlling other men and women,
[02:25:26.033 --> 02:25:26.293]  Okay?
[02:25:26.513 --> 02:25:27.593]  You become sadistic.
[02:25:27.814 --> 02:25:29.654]  You don't see them as human beings anymore.
[02:25:29.974 --> 02:25:31.915]  And that's why it's possible to do that.
[02:25:32.235 --> 02:25:41.637]  That explains the whole psychological nature that it is very possible... And by the way, it is almost unknown in history for governments not to mass murder and slaughter and go totally nuts.
[02:25:41.977 --> 02:25:44.478]  It's the very nature of sickos to get into control.
[02:25:45.337 --> 02:25:49.819]  Well, that's because a normal person doesn't have an appetite to continually, you know, try to exert power.
[02:25:49.839 --> 02:25:55.562]  Well, I'm glad you said normal, because you're absolutely right, because government is just a gang of kill-if-these-are-liars.
[02:25:55.682 --> 02:26:01.244]  And someone, another host of GCN had asked me, didn't the founding fathers at least have good intentions?
[02:26:01.564 --> 02:26:08.047]  And I said, well, I don't care what their intentions are, but I would say no, because the one question you need to ask about their intentions is this.
[02:26:08.708 --> 02:26:13.730]  Were the services of protection, which is the only legitimate basis of government was to protect, which of course they don't,
[02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:17.472]  Were their services provided on a voluntary basis?
[02:26:18.012 --> 02:26:18.252]  No.
[02:26:18.593 --> 02:26:22.095]  Anybody who's willing to kill you in order to protect you is not normal.
[02:26:22.535 --> 02:26:27.638]  And that's why government can never be legitimate, and that's why government cannot be restricted.
[02:26:27.838 --> 02:26:28.698]  Well, here's an example.
[02:26:28.758 --> 02:26:32.520]  In New York, guns are banned unless you pay the sheriff $30,000 on average.
[02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:33.901]  You've got to pay them off.
[02:26:33.921 --> 02:26:34.422]  That's public.
[02:26:35.142 --> 02:26:42.206]  And then the courts have ruled the police have no duty to protect you, but we want your guns, and we're not going to protect you.
[02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:50.117]  Exactly, and you have to look, and somebody needs to call someone like Schumer to the carpet and say, look, this is the law.
[02:26:50.558 --> 02:26:52.059]  It's federal, state, and local.
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.921]  There's no duty to protect anybody.
[02:26:54.062 --> 02:27:05.093]  Now, if there's no duty to protect anybody, and we know statistically over two million crimes are prevented by private people every year, and not by the police, tell me why you want the guns.
[02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:15.223]  It would be a very interesting response if you could get one, which you probably would not, because he would probably argue that they do have a duty to protect, which of course is an outright lie.
[02:27:16.324 --> 02:27:24.589]  Because we have all the court cases in their own statements, and I'm not saying there aren't some good cops who change your tire and help you, and help you cross the street, and that the firemen don't do a great job.
[02:27:25.009 --> 02:27:33.995]  It's just that, cynically at the top, it's something but a bunch of parasites, and government is a mechanism, a proboscis to suck our innards.
[02:27:34.475 --> 02:27:34.876]  We're good to go.
[02:27:36.050 --> 02:27:39.052]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.973 --> 02:27:42.655]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:30:45.942 --> 02:30:48.524]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:49.084 --> 02:30:51.867]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:58.374 --> 02:31:01.536]  Mark Stevens, we've got Dr. Bill Veith riding shotgun with us.
[02:31:01.556 --> 02:31:08.380]  By the way, there's links to Bill and his wife's website, BringOurTroopsHome, up on Infowars.com.
[02:31:08.520 --> 02:31:11.621]  These are great little yellow ribbons you can put on your car that say, Support Troops, Bring Them Home.
[02:31:12.262 --> 02:31:13.302]  That's how you really support them.
[02:31:13.422 --> 02:31:17.525]  And by the way, we do carry adventures in legal land.
[02:31:17.565 --> 02:31:22.387]  If you've ever felt there was something wrong with the world, but you just couldn't put your finger on it, then this is the book for you.
[02:31:22.467 --> 02:31:25.329]  Perhaps the most controversial, informative, entertaining book.
[02:31:26.102 --> 02:31:31.026]  To see print in years, you need to read Mark Stevens' Adventures in Legal Land.
[02:31:31.926 --> 02:31:32.667]  It's a big book.
[02:31:32.827 --> 02:31:34.048]  It's an easy read, though.
[02:31:34.388 --> 02:31:40.233]  It'll give you a different view on things, and I think it's very healthy for this whole debate about what we face.
[02:31:40.273 --> 02:31:45.376]  So please go to InfoWars.com to get Adventures in Legal Land, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:49.824 --> 02:31:52.746]  And there's Mark battering his microphone.
[02:31:53.966 --> 02:31:54.386]  Sorry, man.
[02:31:54.666 --> 02:31:55.347]  Hey, that's alright.
[02:31:55.407 --> 02:31:56.287]  Mark, I listen to you sometimes.
[02:31:56.327 --> 02:31:59.329]  I hear you doing it and I go, man, he's mutilating his microphone again.
[02:31:59.889 --> 02:32:00.629]  Batting it about.
[02:32:01.690 --> 02:32:06.312]  No, seriously, my friend, I hope people will get the book that's up on InfoWars.com because it's excellent.
[02:32:06.332 --> 02:32:10.334]  I've been promoting it for years and people have procrastinated and not gotten it.
[02:32:10.354 --> 02:32:10.915]  They really should.
[02:32:12.597 --> 02:32:17.766]  We've only got about 25 minutes left here and later I do want to take some calls.
[02:32:19.308 --> 02:32:21.151]  We'll jam a few in before this hour ends at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:32:28.037 --> 02:32:34.940]  Dr. Veith wanted you to be able to comment on the Stanford and the other research tests they did, but then during the break he was giving me more detail on it.
[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:38.941]  Of course, I've read the studies, but it's been years, but he was describing them perfectly.
[02:32:38.981 --> 02:32:42.443]  So, Dr. Veith, take a minute or two out and for the listeners.
[02:32:43.897 --> 02:32:44.417]  Okay, yeah.
[02:32:44.437 --> 02:32:50.199]  It's actually been a number of years since I've read the studies back when I was in graduate school, but my recollection of them is that
[02:33:00.163 --> 02:33:17.843]  In one of them, an authority figure would tell somebody on command to increase the stimulus of torture to a confederate of the experiment that was in the other room and that person actually believed he could push a button and incrementally increase the amount of
[02:33:18.383 --> 02:33:38.613]  Shock that the person in the other room was getting and the person in the other room each time could tell when the Increments were being increased and that person would scream louder and louder of course that person wasn't really getting shocked But the one that was ordered to give the shock didn't know it thought he was actually given a shot and was doing it on command just because the authority figure was telling him to
[02:33:39.173 --> 02:33:45.980]  And so that shows, you know, they can send our police out and our military and have them do stuff to us just based on the command when the authorities tell them to.
[02:33:46.281 --> 02:33:48.803]  And they say, just following orders, as the Germans said.
[02:33:48.863 --> 02:33:49.965]  Mark, do you want to comment on that?
[02:33:50.825 --> 02:33:53.608]  Yeah, that was the Stanley Milgram experiment.
[02:33:53.628 --> 02:33:56.672]  I know Stanley's better known for the Six Degrees of Separation.
[02:33:57.593 --> 02:34:01.617]  The subject was told that they are not responsible.
[02:34:02.270 --> 02:34:09.517]  And that's why I always tie that together with the Stanford Prison Experiment, the obedience to authority, so-called, and the lack of personal responsibility.
[02:34:09.797 --> 02:34:11.098]  Now, let's expand on that, though.
[02:34:11.519 --> 02:34:12.500]  I mean, let's expand on that.
[02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:18.685]  There's a reason Alberto Gonzalez and John Yoo from the White House are saying, we're going to torture children, we're going to sexually torture them.
[02:34:18.705 --> 02:34:27.073]  It's the reason they say it in public, is they're trying to warp the general public to think, well, authority says they can torture kids, so if they can do that, they can do anything else they want.
[02:34:28.489 --> 02:34:39.180]  Well, right, and the reason why these people are doing that is because if you become sadistic within 6 days of controlling another man or woman, then what does that say to someone who's been doing it for 6 months, 6 years, or 16 years?
[02:34:40.221 --> 02:34:41.362]  And yes, they are trying.
[02:34:41.422 --> 02:34:42.503]  It's all mind control.
[02:34:42.684 --> 02:34:49.711]  And I even say the Constitution is part of that mind control because it convinces you you're a citizen and resident of this non-existent country.
[02:34:50.391 --> 02:34:56.975]  And they are able to then demonize people who are not from the United States.
[02:34:57.035 --> 02:34:59.437]  Well, I've got something that dovetails with that.
[02:34:59.457 --> 02:35:01.038]  If you clearly look at it...
[02:35:01.741 --> 02:35:04.563]  Elite billionaires have the most rights because they're insiders.
[02:35:04.583 --> 02:35:05.503]  They're a good old boy club.
[02:35:05.943 --> 02:35:09.685]  Then the illegal aliens get more welfare, more tuition.
[02:35:09.705 --> 02:35:11.366]  They don't have to follow the laws.
[02:35:11.386 --> 02:35:15.388]  If you really study it, illegal aliens have more rights than citizens.
[02:35:15.428 --> 02:35:19.310]  Being a citizen in America is really now a negative.
[02:35:19.350 --> 02:35:22.091]  It means you're a fat chump to be pushed around.
[02:35:22.131 --> 02:35:24.453]  I mean, I guess it means you're an easy mark.
[02:35:24.473 --> 02:35:25.033]  Go ahead.
[02:35:25.829 --> 02:35:44.398]  Well, the citizen, convincing someone he's a citizen, okay, and using that false theology I call it, because, like, separation of church and church, which, you know, the state is a considered church, that enables them, or conditions them, to accept certain other premises, which is, I have to pay taxes, I have to do this, and I have to do that.
[02:35:45.279 --> 02:35:51.882]  And by creating this, by creating citizens, which don't exist, you can then create illegal aliens, which don't exist.
[02:35:51.902 --> 02:35:52.863]  And I have an article about that.
[02:35:52.883 --> 02:35:54.744]  And I'm not saying that there are people who are not trespassers.
[02:35:55.598 --> 02:35:57.298]  I'm in Arizona, I understand the situation.
[02:35:57.938 --> 02:36:10.441]  But by focusing the attention on a non-issue like illegal aliens, gets people and their attention diverted from the fact that there's a group of men and women called government who are stealing and robbing them blind.
[02:36:10.721 --> 02:36:15.482]  They're torturing them, they're spying on them, they're controlling them, they're regulating them, they're killing them, they're lying to them.
[02:36:15.982 --> 02:36:24.304]  And people are, instead of being focused on that, hey, you know, the Bush and gang and, you know, gender politics, these people are stealing from me!
[02:36:24.604 --> 02:36:25.324]  They're not protecting
[02:36:27.797 --> 02:36:28.377]  Mark, are you there?
[02:36:29.257 --> 02:36:32.858]  I think he was using a digital line to be connected to us.
[02:36:32.878 --> 02:36:34.859]  I didn't recommend that, but people insisted so.
[02:36:35.319 --> 02:36:35.799]  Reconnect?
[02:36:35.859 --> 02:36:39.700]  He's on a Skype line, isn't he?
[02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:40.901]  Yeah, get him back on.
[02:36:41.881 --> 02:36:42.181]  Thank you.
[02:36:43.381 --> 02:36:46.182]  Let me add this addendum to what we've been saying here.
[02:36:47.094 --> 02:36:52.837]  The globalists are setting up a one-world government, where they set the rules, where they have the armies, where they have the courts.
[02:36:53.457 --> 02:37:10.645]  And the way they've written the rules in the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the Ex-Im Bank, the International Bank of International Settlements, they've set it up where they follow no rules, they're above the law, and then we, the people, have absolutely no rights and are chattel slaves for our best interests.
[02:37:11.065 --> 02:37:12.286]  Dr. V, do you want to comment on that?
[02:37:12.978 --> 02:37:14.579]  Well, that's exactly what they've done.
[02:37:14.619 --> 02:37:20.044]  I mean, we do not want to be a citizen of the international community.
[02:37:20.084 --> 02:37:28.671]  We do not want to be a citizen of the United States, because a citizen has what are called civil rights, and that takes away our God-given rights.
[02:37:28.691 --> 02:37:29.892]  The 14th Amendment replaced it.
[02:37:29.912 --> 02:37:33.515]  See, you can argue with Mark Stevens about, was it ever legitimate?
[02:37:34.195 --> 02:37:34.856]  That can be debated.
[02:37:34.876 --> 02:37:36.436]  We've got to have some type of system, I believe.
[02:37:36.456 --> 02:37:43.940]  But you certainly can't debate that now we have a totally illegitimate, out-of-control, crime syndicate that is predatory and seizes its cattle.
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:44.260]  Right.
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:48.822]  And you know, the Constitution really did not put any restrictions on the people.
[02:37:49.182 --> 02:37:56.186]  The Constitution spoke to the powers and the disabilities of the federal government.
[02:37:56.786 --> 02:37:58.347]  It didn't make people do one thing.
[02:37:59.248 --> 02:38:01.691]  Uh, it just talked to the government what they were allowed to do.
[02:38:02.152 --> 02:38:12.063]  It's the same thing as, let's say I have a get-together with my neighbors where we live and we hire a company to come in and mow the lawn and clean the common area.
[02:38:12.623 --> 02:38:15.827]  And we tell them, here's what you're allowed to do and here's what you're not allowed to do.
[02:38:16.207 --> 02:38:19.168]  And then we start paying them to come in and mow the lawn and clean the common area.
[02:38:19.188 --> 02:38:23.769]  And over time, they start telling us what to do and how we need to do our lawns.
[02:38:23.829 --> 02:38:30.871]  And all of a sudden, this company that we hired and gave them specific powers, they're telling us how we need to operate and regulate our lawns.
[02:38:31.051 --> 02:38:33.051]  That's the same thing that happened with the Constitution.
[02:38:33.251 --> 02:38:34.431]  Yeah, I can hear Mark.
[02:38:34.932 --> 02:38:35.732]  You're absolutely right.
[02:38:37.132 --> 02:38:39.154]  I mean, everybody's experiences that's had employees.
[02:38:39.214 --> 02:38:44.800]  Most employees are pretty good, but always you get one who starts trying to slowly, oh, for your own good, hey, you need to do this.
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:51.646]  And if you let them do that, especially doctors, you know, with office managers they have, the office manager ends up being over them, telling them what to do.
[02:38:51.666 --> 02:38:54.049]  And that's what government, the people are supposed to be above the government.
[02:38:54.069 --> 02:38:56.832]  You know, the liberals always say, we don't have God-given rights, they're civil rights.
[02:38:56.872 --> 02:38:58.213]  Wait, civil's from government?
[02:38:58.533 --> 02:39:07.417]  Even if you don't believe in God, which I do, you want something above man, because then that can't be changed, because you're going to have a God, whether it's government or whether it's Jesus Christ.
[02:39:07.938 --> 02:39:10.459]  Well, you know, we have Creator-given rights.
[02:39:10.539 --> 02:39:14.601]  Even if you don't want to call it a God, I know that the government did not create me.
[02:39:15.021 --> 02:39:18.082]  So I don't want to get my rights, or my lack of rights, from the government.
[02:39:18.102 --> 02:39:20.824]  Well, here's another example, and we'll go back to Mark Stevens, who I'm honored to have with us.
[02:39:21.464 --> 02:39:27.687]  A black man, the laws 200 years ago said he was not a human being, he had no rights, and he got out of line.
[02:39:28.681 --> 02:39:30.103]  He could have his head beaten in.
[02:39:30.123 --> 02:39:32.625]  Go ahead and put Mark on hold.
[02:39:32.745 --> 02:39:33.706]  His line's got noise on it.
[02:39:35.806 --> 02:39:38.428]  He could have his head beaten in if he tried to escape.
[02:39:38.488 --> 02:39:39.989]  He could have one of his feet chopped off.
[02:39:40.470 --> 02:39:42.131]  And the government said, hey, that's the law.
[02:39:42.151 --> 02:39:42.752]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:39:43.092 --> 02:39:53.040]  The organic, God-given right of a free human being that came out of his mother's womb from the congress between his mother and his father, that didn't come from the state.
[02:39:53.060 --> 02:40:02.367]  And that black man, I don't care what the law was, had a right to grab that axe handle out of Master's hands and beat Master's brains out all over the ground and to escape.
[02:40:02.767 --> 02:40:03.888]  He is not a slave.
[02:40:05.089 --> 02:40:05.929]  Mark Stevens, are you there?
[02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:08.330]  Let's bring Mark back up.
[02:40:09.070 --> 02:40:09.590]  It's okay, Mark.
[02:40:09.610 --> 02:40:11.011]  Go ahead and comment on what we were just saying.
[02:40:11.791 --> 02:40:16.593]  Well, this is why government is the problem, the nature of government is the problem, because it's not voluntary.
[02:40:16.613 --> 02:40:21.194]  If normal people bring the services to the market on a voluntary basis,
[02:40:21.847 --> 02:40:32.033]  And this way, if someone's paying for a service, and the employee or the contractor gets abusive, you can just stop paying him, and the abuse will probably stop.
[02:40:32.773 --> 02:40:42.678]  When you have government where, by its very nature, is the slave master, there's not much you can do about it, especially when you have the fact that there's no personal accountability, there's no personal liability.
[02:40:42.899 --> 02:40:50.963]  And then if the black slave, or the Roman-Germanic slave, whatever, tries to escape and kills the master, he's then called a terrorist.
[02:40:52.173 --> 02:41:01.300]  Well, anybody who opposes the dictates of some lunatic doing business as a government or calling himself a state is always going to be viewed as an enemy.
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:04.242]  The real enemy of the state, so-called, is the truth.
[02:41:04.502 --> 02:41:07.204]  When you show that there is no state, there are no citizens.
[02:41:07.464 --> 02:41:10.026]  And that's why I've been able to go into court and be so successful.
[02:41:10.146 --> 02:41:15.090]  Other people who have bought my scripts have gone in and been so successful at exposing that there is never a case.
[02:41:15.310 --> 02:41:26.240]  By the way, Mark, for those that don't understand what we're talking about here, can you specifically get into my analogy of the black slave?
[02:41:26.741 --> 02:41:29.763]  I mean, according to this government, they would say he's a terrorist.
[02:41:29.783 --> 02:41:40.153]  Then I would add, have you seen the new federally written Virginia anti-terrorism manual given to all the state employees that says land rights activists, property rights activists are terrorists?
[02:41:41.445 --> 02:41:48.472]  Well, according to somebody who doesn't believe, like, if you look in my book, and you're probably familiar with Senate Resolution No.
[02:41:48.492 --> 02:41:53.918]  62, that people who do business as a government, or as the state, believe that all property is theirs.
[02:41:54.238 --> 02:42:00.645]  So when you've got somebody saying it's not, that is a threat to them, and they would consider them, and I could see them considering them a terrorist.
[02:42:01.272 --> 02:42:05.697]  Anything that threatens their so-called, well, their little system is going to be seen as a threat.
[02:42:05.757 --> 02:42:06.938]  And I want people to understand this.
[02:42:07.138 --> 02:42:12.304]  I mean, governments at every state level and federal level are issuing manuals, are saying protesting is terror.
[02:42:12.604 --> 02:42:13.645]  Land rights protesting.
[02:42:13.685 --> 02:42:15.367]  It says peaceful is terror.
[02:42:15.507 --> 02:42:16.348]  Everything is terror.
[02:42:16.568 --> 02:42:17.830]  Founding fathers are terrorists.
[02:42:17.890 --> 02:42:18.631]  Freedom is terror.
[02:42:18.831 --> 02:42:19.912]  Homeschoolers are terrorists.
[02:42:19.932 --> 02:42:21.173]  I mean, they actually say it.
[02:42:21.213 --> 02:42:22.615]  Dr. V, do you want to comment on that?
[02:42:23.195 --> 02:42:26.936]  Well, most of what I've learned about that, actually, I've heard from listening to you.
[02:42:26.956 --> 02:42:35.277]  But, yeah, I know of cases where people would try to assert their property rights or talk about the Constitution or label terrorists.
[02:42:35.297 --> 02:42:37.418]  So you're not even supposed to bring up the Constitution anymore.
[02:42:37.478 --> 02:42:40.318]  Well, we have the public manuals posted with the phone numbers on them.
[02:42:40.358 --> 02:42:41.498]  I mean, they don't even hide it anymore.
[02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:41.898]  I mean, how?
[02:42:41.978 --> 02:42:45.639]  I mean, Mark Stevens, that really shows how wild they've gotten, though.
[02:42:45.659 --> 02:42:50.460]  I mean, they weren't doing that 50 years ago, openly saying that if you protest, you're a terrorist.
[02:42:51.596 --> 02:43:05.719]  Well, no, they did that back in, you know, around World War I, where Woodrow Wilson really was the one that, uh, was the guy who was rounding up anybody who was a so-called anarchist, or protested, or said anything negative about the war.
[02:43:05.799 --> 02:43:12.061]  Yeah, trading with the Enemy Act, which, by the way, multiple governors, including Rhode Island and other areas, have tried to implement that very law again.
[02:43:13.363 --> 02:43:17.866]  Well, and you've mentioned on the show a number of times, if people just go to your website, you have the information.
[02:43:17.886 --> 02:43:19.047]  You could even do a Google search.
[02:43:19.287 --> 02:43:23.911]  My gosh, what they wanted to do in Oregon, they want to set up prison camps!
[02:43:23.931 --> 02:43:26.953]  I mean, concentration camps, for heaven's sake.
[02:43:27.173 --> 02:43:30.876]  It's a life in prison in a forced labor camp or downloading music.
[02:43:31.436 --> 02:43:36.620]  Any firearms violation, instant life in prison in a forced labor... It says, forced labor forest camp.
[02:43:37.597 --> 02:43:47.624]  Yeah, if that's not enough, I mean, I've spoken enough about what it is going to take for people to give up this theology called politics and, you know, the laws and orders.
[02:43:47.664 --> 02:43:50.146]  The government's not there to protect you, it never was.
[02:43:50.627 --> 02:43:54.509]  And a good example of how corrupt the system was, you talked about how corrupted the courts are.
[02:43:54.529 --> 02:44:02.976]  One of the questions I've used, and I've never got a responsive answer to the second question, I ask, am I presumed innocent of the alleged crime?
[02:44:02.996 --> 02:44:03.976]  And they'll say, yes.
[02:44:04.217 --> 02:44:05.998]  Well, am I presumed innocent
[02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:17.239]  of uh... every element of the alleged crime and it won't go any further because jurisdiction's an element of the crime and he has to presume he's innocent so he's gotta let me go and that's just as unfair today as it was in 1776
[02:44:18.823 --> 02:44:25.267]  The difference, though, which you point out all the time, is the degree of control that they were able to exercise today, as opposed to 1776.
[02:44:25.407 --> 02:44:27.708]  Well, yeah, that's the difference.
[02:44:27.788 --> 02:44:31.270]  In the past, most men didn't care if 20 people came for them.
[02:44:31.310 --> 02:44:34.812]  If they came for their family, they were going to fight to the death, and so government backed off.
[02:44:34.912 --> 02:44:35.572]  We were men.
[02:44:36.313 --> 02:44:42.076]  I mean, really, it's like Tony Montana says in Scarface, there's one thing in this world that gives orders, okay?
[02:44:42.336 --> 02:44:45.298]  And that's being a man and just being willing to get it on.
[02:44:45.888 --> 02:44:47.088]  And it's simple, folks.
[02:44:47.108 --> 02:44:50.029]  You're a lot safer when you're ready to get in a fight.
[02:44:50.049 --> 02:44:52.229]  I mean, it's not even a courage thing.
[02:44:52.269 --> 02:44:54.710]  It's just that's who you are, and you're willing to fight.
[02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:56.330]  And I tell you, I was talking to Bill Vieth.
[02:44:56.350 --> 02:45:00.611]  Probably some of the things he's doing legally right now, he's putting his money where his mouth is, fighting these people.
[02:45:00.951 --> 02:45:01.851]  And I can only commend him.
[02:45:01.871 --> 02:45:03.012]  You know, I choose my battles.
[02:45:03.052 --> 02:45:03.992]  We all have to do that.
[02:45:04.012 --> 02:45:10.033]  But I wanted to bring up something else to both of you gentlemen here before we go to break and come back and take one or two final calls in the final segment if we have time.
[02:45:11.545 --> 02:45:15.147]  The government admittedly radiated tens of thousands of American children killing them.
[02:45:15.367 --> 02:45:26.652]  Black men, syphilis, Tuskegee, sterilizing 400 and something thousand women, the ring-armed children I used, you know, these popular examples, public, you know, radiating 110,000 Jewish children, the Israeli government for the U.S.
[02:45:26.672 --> 02:45:27.193]  government did.
[02:45:27.653 --> 02:45:29.814]  They do these as tests to test their own minions.
[02:45:30.374 --> 02:45:37.520]  You know, the biological spring, all of this, and people go, well, they wouldn't kill 2,850-something on 9-11.
[02:45:38.260 --> 02:45:38.801]  Baloney!
[02:45:38.841 --> 02:45:42.143]  We have all these admissions where they radiate little babies for fun!
[02:45:43.084 --> 02:45:45.406]  You want to comment, Dr. Veef, about the psychology of that?
[02:45:47.087 --> 02:45:50.089]  Yes, well, you know, they're experts at mind control.
[02:45:51.511 --> 02:46:04.104]  They understand a lot of these experiments that these universities have done over the years have been funded by the globalists who want to figure out better ways to mind control the people because mind control has to precede behavioral control.
[02:46:04.685 --> 02:46:08.189]  So they hire the best in the world to conduct these experiments.
[02:46:08.709 --> 02:46:11.352]  You know, even TV puts you in a trance state.
[02:46:11.372 --> 02:46:18.879]  When you go to the movies and they darken the theater and they take out all the external distractions and they focus on the big screen, you're in a trance state.
[02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:24.925]  And when they get you in that kind of a trance state, you are susceptible to suggestions.
[02:46:25.246 --> 02:46:26.507]  You've got a specific degree in that.
[02:46:27.225 --> 02:46:32.289]  I've got a PhD in psychology and a doctoral degree in clinical hypnotherapy.
[02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:37.754]  So, you know, even though I don't use clinical hypnotherapy in my practice right now, I've studied a lot about trans states.
[02:46:37.814 --> 02:46:39.675]  I want to have you in for a full hour sometime on that.
[02:46:39.855 --> 02:46:40.095]  Okay.
[02:46:40.115 --> 02:46:41.176]  I'd be glad to do that.
[02:46:41.196 --> 02:46:41.857]  Mark, comments?
[02:46:41.877 --> 02:46:51.865]  I think he's right, you know, and I would also say that, and I've said this a number of times, you don't necessarily have to be in a trans state to have the images
[02:46:52.954 --> 02:46:54.535]  I was talking about your map of the world.
[02:46:54.575 --> 02:47:07.863]  I know that's not original to me, and we all have our own individual maps of the world, but you could just have Fox News on in the house, and it's going to pass through your conscious mind, right past it, and become a part of your map of the world.
[02:47:08.303 --> 02:47:09.964]  That's why it's called programming.
[02:47:10.545 --> 02:47:17.069]  But I agree, yeah, it puts you in a more susceptible state, especially as far as... Well, there's a flicker rate.
[02:47:17.089 --> 02:47:18.930]  I mean, there's a flicker rate, all of it.
[02:47:20.811 --> 02:47:21.111]  I'm sorry?
[02:47:21.611 --> 02:47:22.872]  The flicker rate of the television.
[02:47:23.913 --> 02:47:24.433]  Well, yeah.
[02:47:24.573 --> 02:47:25.974]  You don't even have to be watching it.
[02:47:25.994 --> 02:47:29.936]  You can just be on in the background where the sound of it is going.
[02:47:29.996 --> 02:47:32.377]  I'm just saying it's more effective with the flickering, though.
[02:47:32.417 --> 02:47:39.341]  Well, they have multiple techniques, and I mean, we're under barrage from all of them all the time, and most of the time we're not even aware of it.
[02:47:40.761 --> 02:47:47.725]  But if you're constantly conscious of that, and have your own map that you've laid out, I mean, to me, now when I see propaganda, it just irritates me.
[02:47:47.765 --> 02:47:48.825]  It's noise now.
[02:47:48.885 --> 02:47:49.686]  It's dissonance, yeah.
[02:47:51.358 --> 02:48:01.626]  Oh yeah, and you can get going on at proclaiming to be, once you understand the truth of what's going to go on in citizens, nations, and countries, and you see someone on TV saying, I'm the president, you know he's lying through his teeth.
[02:48:01.886 --> 02:48:03.167]  It's just like the whole war on terror.
[02:48:03.207 --> 02:48:07.991]  The only thing I need to show that the war on terror is a complete fraud is to show there's no duty to protect anybody.
[02:48:08.411 --> 02:48:14.216]  So when this nutcase gets on the TV and says my most solemn obligation is to protect the American people, no it's not.
[02:48:14.736 --> 02:48:18.599]  And Jim Jones, Jim Jones said he made everybody drill, drink, and make Kool-Aid for their safety.
[02:48:21.554 --> 02:48:29.177]  Stay there, final segment with Dr. Bill Veith and of course Mark Stevens and we'll see if we can jam a few quick calls in, quick questions.
[02:48:29.597 --> 02:48:30.997]  The book is Adventures in Legal Land.
[02:48:31.017 --> 02:48:34.639]  We carry it at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:48:42.661 --> 02:48:43.642]  I'm really proud of that site.
[02:48:43.662 --> 02:48:44.342]  Be sure and check it out.
[02:48:47.051 --> 02:48:49.894]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.154 --> 02:48:51.735]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.076 --> 02:48:56.760]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.100 --> 02:49:01.524]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.945 --> 02:49:06.149]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.369 --> 02:49:09.212]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.292 --> 02:49:11.794]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:49:11.974 --> 02:49:18.542]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[02:49:46.368 --> 02:49:48.009]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:48.129 --> 02:49:52.272]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:52.372 --> 02:49:55.253]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:55.333 --> 02:50:02.037]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:02.238 --> 02:50:05.239]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:07.821]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:07.961 --> 02:50:12.684]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:12.864 --> 02:50:27.431]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:51:48.092 --> 02:51:50.916]  We're talking about propaganda, and you can't deny it.
[02:51:50.956 --> 02:51:55.141]  When you watch TV, you watch the news, white males are always shown as bumbling idiots.
[02:51:55.621 --> 02:52:00.487]  But they'll do more than that, because they know that's the middle class, that's where some of the money, some of the old power is.
[02:52:01.368 --> 02:52:05.053]  Really powerful white males are attacking their rivals that run things.
[02:52:06.775 --> 02:52:08.356]  Okay, be glad to do that.
[02:52:26.616 --> 02:52:27.577]  Because it's everywhere.
[02:52:27.977 --> 02:52:31.820]  We're social creatures and so they manipulate us through basically dog training.
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:33.841]  That's why we have dogs in our homes.
[02:52:33.861 --> 02:52:36.443]  We're very similar psychologically to them at base level.
[02:52:36.983 --> 02:52:39.065]  Mark Stevens, let's jam a few final calls in here.
[02:52:39.125 --> 02:52:40.726]  Peggy in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding.
[02:52:40.966 --> 02:52:41.506]  You're on the air.
[02:52:41.546 --> 02:52:42.127]  Go ahead Peggy.
[02:52:42.447 --> 02:52:43.648]  Hi Alex.
[02:52:43.868 --> 02:52:45.729]  I'm an attorney originally from Ohio.
[02:52:46.430 --> 02:52:50.192]  I can testify that what you say about mind control being everywhere is absolutely true.
[02:52:52.170 --> 02:52:55.451]  I've been harassed in Cincinnati pretty bad.
[02:52:55.491 --> 02:53:00.753]  We've had to move, and we moved about four years ago, and we've moved three times trying to get away from the harassment.
[02:53:01.533 --> 02:53:19.559]  It consists of, when I was in law school, I didn't realize this until later, because like the doctor said about cognitive dissonance, I came from a sort of conservative and extremely naive point of view, and I didn't fit in with the people in the law school and the general
[02:53:25.097 --> 02:53:28.499]  Well, they basically barred me from getting a job in real estate.
[02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:41.947]  Not only that, but after I got a job for $20,000 a year as basically a paralegal, they started to ransom me in the recorder's office.
[02:53:42.147 --> 02:53:44.769]  I was assaulted frequently.
[02:53:45.805 --> 02:53:51.107]  And they didn't like how I was responding to it, because I was trying to do it the normal way and go to the prosecutor and so on.
[02:53:51.567 --> 02:53:55.869]  They instituted a series of three legal prosecutions against me, in which I was found not guilty.
[02:53:56.149 --> 02:53:57.570]  Mark Stevens, we're almost out of time.
[02:53:57.610 --> 02:53:58.910]  Comments to what she's talking about?
[02:54:00.391 --> 02:54:03.072]  I'm not familiar with something like that.
[02:54:04.653 --> 02:54:09.815]  Well, it got to the point where we left town in 2002, and we've been trying to get away from this.
[02:54:10.375 --> 02:54:11.716]  I've been trying to get somebody to help me.
[02:54:14.946 --> 02:54:16.908]  They basically track me through the local police.
[02:54:17.508 --> 02:54:20.811]  And I can't do anything or try to reach anybody that can help me.
[02:54:20.831 --> 02:54:21.711]  Well, a lot of it is.
[02:54:21.771 --> 02:54:26.575]  A lot of this predatory system, if you act afraid or you act concerned, they dominantly come in.
[02:54:26.615 --> 02:54:31.459]  If you act like you're in command, and a lot of us just do this organically, you are in command.
[02:54:31.499 --> 02:54:32.820]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:33.040 --> 02:54:40.406]  Mark, isn't a lot of this has gotten so criminal now that just stomping around like you're the ogre makes a lot of these people leave you alone?
[02:54:41.631 --> 02:54:46.237]  It can help in some situations and some it's going, depending on the individual, might actually embolden them.
[02:54:47.078 --> 02:54:50.703]  And, you know, I don't believe in being a martyr to, you know, it seems like I'm a traffic stop.
[02:54:51.163 --> 02:54:55.489]  But, you know, depending on the individual, yeah, it could be very effective.
[02:54:56.289 --> 02:55:03.116]  Well, I mean, by that, I've noticed as soon as someone is wrongly subservient, they psychologically see it as their role to dominate.
[02:55:03.376 --> 02:55:08.361]  And then if you are confident, but really confident, that telegraphs, then it's their role to be subservient.
[02:55:08.381 --> 02:55:09.602]  Dr. Veef, you're a psychologist.
[02:55:09.622 --> 02:55:10.382]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:55:10.523 --> 02:55:10.963]  I sure do.
[02:55:10.983 --> 02:55:12.004]  I agree with it totally.
[02:55:12.024 --> 02:55:13.385]  I mean, that's my experience.
[02:55:14.266 --> 02:55:15.107]  It's a good observation.
[02:55:16.836 --> 02:55:26.962]  In my experience, what happens when I go into court and I use an unsigned plea of guilty to disarm them psychologically, or I'll go into a tax meeting and say, we're prepared to pay, we'd just like to see the facts.
[02:55:27.402 --> 02:55:31.564]  That puts them in a pretty dominant role, and they feel that they're going to get what they want.
[02:55:31.744 --> 02:55:32.965]  I ask a couple of questions,
[02:55:33.625 --> 02:55:34.967]  Absolutely cuts them off at the knee.
[02:55:35.027 --> 02:55:45.276]  I'm not trying to force them to see things my way, but they now, once I ask the questions, the wheels start turning, and then they start to realize I don't have a case here, and they typically back down.
[02:55:45.416 --> 02:55:48.719]  Mark Stevens, it's clear I'm going to have to get you back up for longer in the near future.
[02:55:48.739 --> 02:55:53.103]  Author of Adventures in Legal Land, and I hope folks will go to InfoWars.com and get the book.
[02:55:53.143 --> 02:55:54.044]  Thanks for joining us, Mark.
[02:55:54.699 --> 02:55:55.740]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:56.080]  You bet.
[02:55:56.100 --> 02:55:56.821]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:55:56.841 --> 02:55:58.062]  And Dr. Bill Veith, this has been great.
[02:55:58.522 --> 02:55:59.303]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:55:59.323 --> 02:55:59.983]  I've really enjoyed it.
[02:56:00.003 --> 02:56:00.203]  You bet.
[02:56:00.223 --> 02:56:01.104]  Will you come back in with us?
[02:56:01.144 --> 02:56:01.985]  I'll be glad to, Alex.
[02:56:02.025 --> 02:56:02.365]  I loved it.
[02:56:02.946 --> 02:56:03.726]  It was great having you.
[02:56:03.926 --> 02:56:04.207]  Thank you.
[02:56:04.387 --> 02:56:06.048]  We ought to do a whole show on mind control.
[02:56:06.068 --> 02:56:15.756]  I had a great DVD here that had a lot of facts, and it was expropriated by somebody that watched it at home, and it hasn't come back to the office yet, but I want to play some clips of that, too, on air.
[02:56:16.096 --> 02:56:17.357]  So we'll have you back real soon.
[02:56:17.377 --> 02:56:18.137]  We've been honored to have you.
[02:56:18.177 --> 02:56:18.338]  Great.
[02:56:18.398 --> 02:56:18.718]  Thank you.
[02:56:18.878 --> 02:56:19.118]  You bet.
[02:56:19.338 --> 02:56:20.779]  Folks, we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:22.661]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
