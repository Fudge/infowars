[00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:06.435]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:08.156]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:09.977]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:11.438]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:13.119]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.521]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.043]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:44.284]  Well, I'm fired up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:46.486]  In fact, I've never cooled down.
[00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:49.844]  I was, of course, on Coast to Coast AM last night.
[00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:59.612]  I thought it was an excellent three-hour broadcast that I was able to be involved with George Norrie and the second biggest radio show in the country.
[00:01:00.173 --> 00:01:13.264]  Always honored to be a part of that, and we discussed the Cashless Society control and tracking grid, and I don't think I've ever heard that much information come out in mainstream media in a major venue on the subject.
[00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:22.816]  So that was very informative, and I want to go back over, kind of an overview of just how serious this is today, spend maybe 10 minutes on it.
[00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:30.864]  We also talked about the new infiltration of the Bohemian Grove, the new footage that's in the new documentary, The Order of Death.
[00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:34.487]  And then also, Nori wanted to talk about Iran quite a bit.
[00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.436]  And listen, we need to talk about Iran again today.
[00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:48.904]  So we'll do that throughout the three hours because it's so important and just some huge new developments coming out on that front.
[00:01:49.365 --> 00:01:53.088]  And front by front, I mean, pun intended, we are very close to that.
[00:01:54.111 --> 00:02:04.521]  We have the Professor Castle, who debated John Yoo, one of the White House advisors that wrote memos that Bush could torture children in front of their parents and crush their body parts.
[00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:06.003]  Very, very sick.
[00:02:06.723 --> 00:02:07.805]  He'll be joining us.
[00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:09.546]  He was there at the University debating Mr. Yoo.
[00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:14.387]  We have that audio clip as well, so we'll be playing it.
[00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:17.551]  That's in the second hour scheduled.
[00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:27.140]  And then in the third hour, Dylan Avery, one of the producers of the amazing 9-11 doc, Loose Change.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.622]  Now there's Loose Change 2.
[00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:46.194]  Even better, much better than the first, and we're carrying it here at InfoWars.com, here on Real Talk Radio, real issues of significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.636]  I got an email the other day going, you know, I've heard of another show called Real Talk Radio.
[00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:53.897]  Alex, uh, well, you know, I called the show that six, seven years ago, five years ago.
[00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:55.517]  I even had t-shirts printed up that said it.
[00:02:55.557 --> 00:02:56.537]  I'd wear them about.
[00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:59.238]  And other shows have claimed that mantle.
[00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:03.159]  So I thought, you know, I might as well just use my name since others have tried to do it.
[00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.700]  So it's a Real Talk Radio, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.000]  Okay.
[00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:10.372]  Here's some of the news.
[00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:13.694]  Bin Laden warns of attacks, offers truce.
[00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:15.595]  This is total theater.
[00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:19.436]  Now they're claiming the bombing last week in Pakistan, big victory.
[00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:30.941]  That's right out of the neocon Republican strategy book where they said we need victories, even if they're fake, or another terror attack to get the people behind our agenda.
[00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:35.544]  And I heard the neocons today on the radio running around foaming at the mouth celebrating over it.
[00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:36.464]  It's just total theater.
[00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:41.308]  Meanwhile, Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.330]  No wonder Americans are so scared.
[00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.331]  Listen to that headline.
[00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:45.993]  Iran nukes.
[00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.176]  They don't have what you'd think of as nukes.
[00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:52.299]  They don't have even the materials to make an A-bomb.
[00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.203]  They're ten years away from an A-bomb, the CIA's own reports admit.
[00:03:56.763 --> 00:03:57.965]  Conservatively ten years.
[00:03:58.325 --> 00:03:59.186]  If they were left alone.
[00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.468]  And it just doesn't matter.
[00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:02.248]  It doesn't matter.
[00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:10.396]  Everybody thinks we're about to be nuked by the Iranians, and I believe the globalists probably will detonate a weapon and blame it on them so that you can live in a police state.
[00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:14.881]  But it isn't going to be Iranians kicking down your door wearing black masks with MP5 submachine guns.
[00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:17.883]  It isn't going to be the Iranians taking your pension funds.
[00:04:18.164 --> 00:04:21.627]  It isn't going to be Iranians feeding you genetically engineered food that's very bad for you.
[00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:24.450]  It isn't going to be the Iranians trying to force-inoculate you.
[00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.350]  But, I mean, you know, it feels good.
[00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.552]  If it feels good to hate the Iranians, even though people that hate them don't even know anything about the country, then c'est la vie, folks.
[00:04:31.612 --> 00:04:32.532]  Just c'est la vie.
[00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:37.274]  And they want to compromise, but the world says, no way!
[00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:40.795]  We gon' come in there and you gon' die!
[00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:42.975]  We gon' take your oil.
[00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:46.996]  You gon' give it to us, boy.
[00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:52.238]  So, we'll come back and get into all of this.
[00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:56.899]  And Bush Administration wants all of your Google search records!
[00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.662]  But it's for the children.
[00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:05.526]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.787 --> 00:05:07.368]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:12.392]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:19.459]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.760]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:24.802]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:29.546]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:34.149]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:41.634]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.894 --> 00:05:44.295]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:07:02.057 --> 00:07:06.701]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:07.481]  have diabetes.
[00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:14.747]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:19.431]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:22.453]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:08:06.122 --> 00:08:06.762]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:08.483]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:10.404]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.944 --> 00:08:11.805]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:13.365]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:17.748]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:22.370]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:37.624]  Just in the last few hours, there are global reports coming out.
[00:08:37.664 --> 00:08:40.326]  I have one here from the Associated Press, Reuters, you name it.
[00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:46.031]  That Osama bin Laden warns of new attacks, but he offers a truce.
[00:08:48.306 --> 00:08:53.228]  And I might as well say the Sandman threatens more attacks and offers a truce.
[00:08:53.268 --> 00:08:58.429]  Or maybe Rumble Stillskin warns of attacks but offers a truce.
[00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:02.170]  Or perhaps I should say a false of doom.
[00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.191]  He doesn't really exist outside of
[00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:13.915]  Robert E. Howard, Conan the Barbarian books, but perhaps Thulse of Doom is threatening us and he's going to get us any minute.
[00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:25.805]  Of course, just like a jack-in-the-box, Bin Laden pops out to scare us right on the eve of airstrikes on Iran that could come any day or any month or any year now.
[00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:31.010]  You don't know when they're going to strike, but it looks like sooner than later and right out of the box comes Osama Bin Laden.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.924]  Three and a half years ago, they tried the fat man.
[00:09:34.984 --> 00:09:40.493]  There was a fat guy with a nose about twice the size of Bin Laden's, looked absolutely nothing like him.
[00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:47.544]  And the CIA said it's off the neck and Bin Laden's going to kill us all.
[00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:53.729]  And then, over and over again, they will re-air old Bin Laden tapes, re-edited.
[00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:57.793]  Everyone knows it's the same cave from four-plus years ago.
[00:09:58.073 --> 00:10:03.057]  And then, a day later, there'll be a little retraction, just a small little, oh, that was an old re-edited tape.
[00:10:03.077 --> 00:10:05.759]  But the general public saw it as, Bin Laden is back.
[00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:12.123]  They did a voice-print analysis of the fat Bin Laden, and
[00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:16.923]  It was not Bin Laden because you can have a hundred percent voice print.
[00:10:16.943 --> 00:10:27.529]  You can take the real voice of Bin Laden from interviews and tapes and make a code key to open a pass lock on a voice recognition software system.
[00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:36.694]  And then you take the voice of the fat Bin Laden, and of course the CIA turned down the lights so it would be a little bit blurry and all the rest of it, but
[00:10:37.514 --> 00:10:53.468]  The French, a major university in Canada, US researchers, they all took the voice and tested it, and it wasn't even near the biometric access code of the voice pattern of Osama bin Bush, bin Laden, al-Qaeda.
[00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:55.690]  It wasn't even near it.
[00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:57.632]  And then linguists
[00:10:58.688 --> 00:11:01.170]  Listen to it, and listen to the voice patterns.
[00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:10.676]  It was a Westerner, a Westerner, trying to pose with a Middle Eastern accent.
[00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:12.597]  Sod accent.
[00:11:13.818 --> 00:11:22.123]  And you can go read all the mainstream news articles about that, but again, those are the news articles that are in a few newspapers, and are maybe on a few news wires, but never make the big nightly news.
[00:11:23.212 --> 00:11:31.995]  But, of course, last week they said that over the weekend they had killed the number two Al-Qaeda man, Ford Bin Laden.
[00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:34.156]  And, folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:35.797]  I quit counting it ten times.
[00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:39.438]  And, of course, most of the talk show hosts mix up the two.
[00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:42.639]  The supposed Iraqi commander of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.320]  Talk about a handle the Western media created.
[00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:52.433]  And then there's his supposed doctor, the number two man, and different talk show hosts are saying that he was killed.
[00:11:52.453 --> 00:11:53.614]  They don't even know the names.
[00:11:54.134 --> 00:11:55.055]  It's hard to pronounce them.
[00:11:55.095 --> 00:11:55.775]  I don't blame them.
[00:11:56.776 --> 00:11:58.116]  And both guys have been killed.
[00:11:58.997 --> 00:12:00.638]  Well, I mean, they're killed on a monthly basis.
[00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:08.323]  And the Neocon documents, one of their little memos going around Washington and the Republican circle says, we need a terrorist attack.
[00:12:08.363 --> 00:12:09.824]  The people aren't buying our agenda.
[00:12:10.044 --> 00:12:13.846]  We're all getting in trouble for corruption and bid rigging and war profiteering.
[00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.047]  We've got to do something.
[00:12:16.624 --> 00:12:19.925]  To get people back behind what we're doing, our scams.
[00:12:21.005 --> 00:12:27.787]  And they said a terror attack would really be great, or we could capture Bin Laden or claim we killed him, or that we're killing his lieutenants.
[00:12:27.807 --> 00:12:33.289]  And so you see those policy papers being carried out, being executed.
[00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:36.390]  And it has no connection to reality.
[00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:41.666]  Just absolutely no connection, and it's extremely frustrating for me.
[00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:42.367]  I mean, listen to this.
[00:12:42.807 --> 00:12:45.830]  Bin Laden warns of attacks, offers truce.
[00:12:46.531 --> 00:13:00.303]  Al Jazeera on Tuesday broadcast portions of an audio tape purportedly from Osama Bin Laden saying, Al Qaeda is making preparations for attacks in the United States, but offering a possible truce to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:13:01.704 --> 00:13:08.770]  The voice on the tape said, "...security in the United States is not the reason there have been no attacks since September 11, suicide hijackings.
[00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.193]  Instead, the reason is because there are operations that needed preparations," he said.
[00:13:13.213 --> 00:13:15.215]  Okay, let's just stop right there.
[00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:18.638]  Number one, I'm sure that Al Jazeera is a front.
[00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:22.661]  And by the way, in major polls in the Middle East, most Arabs think that.
[00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:22.901]  Why?
[00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:23.882]  Because they're not stupid.
[00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:30.974]  There are things like Al Arabia and a whole bunch of other channels that are 50 times more hardcore.
[00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:34.875]  I mean, just better reports, more information.
[00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:51.899]  I mean, look, when the British government makes Al Jazeera a major channel and is supporting it, and the Queen of England's giving interviews to it, and David Frost, the little Royal Institute of International Affairs frontman, goes to be their host and their anchor, you know there's a problem.
[00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:59.713]  They've got to be able to talk to the billion Muslims and convince them to be good little slaves so they have to build credibility for Al Jazeera.
[00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:05.018]  And there's literally a hundred different points that prove this without a shadow of a doubt that they're fronts.
[00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:11.003]  But one of the big ones is Bush wanting to bomb them and then that gets released by
[00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:16.390]  Blair cabinet officials and oh Bush is an idiot and Tony Blair to talk him down.
[00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.532]  Folks, if you believe that, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:23.975]  I got some swamp land on Mars that's really a good price for you.
[00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:28.838]  Just send the check and I'll sign over the deed to Martian landscape to you.
[00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:32.943]  This is how they have to create a false choice.
[00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:44.397]  It's like Bill Clinton and George Bush vacationing together and having 11 meetings right before the election, before Clinton even ran back in 1991 and Clinton going to Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:45.157 --> 00:14:48.602]  And then he's a known intelligence asset right out of high school.
[00:14:50.897 --> 00:14:59.159]  Royal Institute of International Affairs, CFR, he went to their Rhodes Scholarship, which is total British intelligence.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.241]  I mean, the Rhodes Scholarship is the prototype of MI5, MI6.
[00:15:04.301 --> 00:15:05.721]  I mean, that's what it is.
[00:15:06.581 --> 00:15:08.842]  I mean, it is to expand the British Empire.
[00:15:09.697 --> 00:15:15.840]  And then now people never could believe me on that when I interviewed the CIA agents who were there watching the cocaine be unloaded for years.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.461]  Bill Clinton pulling up and overseeing operations.
[00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:21.202]  Excellent job, man!
[00:15:21.302 --> 00:15:22.503]  Bush flying in.
[00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:24.884]  I mean, it's a joke, people.
[00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:29.506]  We're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars in this economy being looted.
[00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:32.787]  They don't leave it up to real debates as
[00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.889]  And real presidential elections.
[00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:37.590]  Since Kennedy, we haven't had a real president.
[00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:41.073]  And most of them before that, since Lincoln, weren't real.
[00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:43.655]  And that's just on the record.
[00:15:44.796 --> 00:16:00.087]  I mean, Kennedy, a month before he was killed, at a major university, and you can go read these transcripts out there, said, a secret government's in control, it's totally evil, I'm gonna abolish the CIA and the Federal Reserve, and he signed the executive orders to do it, and had our troops on the way back from
[00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:03.875]  From Vietnam when they blew his head off in Dallas.
[00:16:07.698 --> 00:16:11.562]  So it's the same crew, it's the same crowd, and it's totally staged.
[00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:15.445]  And until we hear that Ahmad Chalabi
[00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:31.891]  We hear that, you know, he's a convicted bank robber, and he was a Iranian torture master, and he's all these things, but oh, he's the good guy, and then he's the bad guy, and he's giving stuff to Iran, and then he flies to the U.S.
[00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:32.931]  to New York, meets with Cheney.
[00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.331]  Now he's the good guy.
[00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:39.012]  They put him in charge of the Iraqi oil program.
[00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:43.693]  I mean, a known convicted crook by our allies!
[00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:49.388]  A known torture master and convicted crook in Jordan runs the oil program.
[00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:53.291]  And they admit that there are tens of millions of dollars every month just missing.
[00:16:54.331 --> 00:16:55.852]  And again, no one gets in trouble.
[00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:57.293]  Just mass looting.
[00:16:57.774 --> 00:17:01.156]  And then meanwhile, I'm driving into the office this morning and I hear Neocons on the radio.
[00:17:01.196 --> 00:17:02.857]  I flip through channels knowing what I hear.
[00:17:03.237 --> 00:17:07.240]  And they were literally celebrating, going, this is a great victory.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.481]  He's offering cruises.
[00:17:08.821 --> 00:17:10.582]  It means we've got him on the ropes.
[00:17:10.882 --> 00:17:11.842]  We're good to go.
[00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:36.636]  I heard that one neocon ago, and I think we killed his number two man!
[00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:39.579]  And I heard that neocon a month ago say they killed the number two man.
[00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:45.383]  And that particular neocon that's on here locally, it's a national show, he's not stupid, he knows it's all staged.
[00:17:46.263 --> 00:17:47.724]  I mean, do you like this, folks?
[00:17:47.964 --> 00:17:52.448]  I mean, look, the government told you that it was all free news and free media, that was a sign of the freedom.
[00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:55.310]  Turns out there's not one free newspaper in Iraq.
[00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:01.194]  But our government will go in and kill you immediately if you don't write exactly what they want.
[00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:03.380]  It's all staged.
[00:18:04.781 --> 00:18:15.910]  And I've got articles right here where respected editors, secular editors over there, are given thirty years by the puppet government if they write an editorial criticizing the occupation.
[00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:17.071]  Oh man, that's freedom!
[00:18:17.292 --> 00:18:26.940]  And then they'll go, well this is a war, Alex, and we gotta... Wait a minute, I thought you... but the other day you were saying that it's freedom and look at the... look at the beautiful free press they've got!
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.661]  And don't you understand that fake press is used here domestically.
[00:18:30.681 --> 00:18:41.707]  The Pentagon admits, with the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information, the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence, excuse me, that they are openly planting fake news stories.
[00:18:42.007 --> 00:18:43.407]  Folks, that is not freedom!
[00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.289]  I mean, this is mind-blowing.
[00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:51.211]  I mean, here's an example of just wordsmithing and total manipulation.
[00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:55.053]  World Net Daily, and you can find these everywhere else in every other major publication.
[00:18:56.386 --> 00:19:00.969]  Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.912]  Air Force has workable war plan with high probability of success.
[00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:06.153]  What?
[00:19:06.673 --> 00:19:09.655]  Blowing up a peaceful uranium enrichment center?
[00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:13.970]  Which you can't even make A-bombs with?
[00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:14.851]  Even A-bombs?
[00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:16.152]  Primitive A-bombs?
[00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:17.052]  I mean, that's just 101.
[00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:22.115]  It's what all the nuclear physicists and nuclear engineers are saying.
[00:19:22.175 --> 00:19:23.075]  It's just, you can't do it.
[00:19:23.115 --> 00:19:25.997]  You can't make a ham sandwich without ham and bread.
[00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:26.877]  You just can't.
[00:19:26.897 --> 00:19:28.898]  There's no ham, there's no bread, you can't make it.
[00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.059]  You understand?
[00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:31.219]  It's just a total lie!
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.541]  But the average person hears this.
[00:19:35.201 --> 00:19:40.064]  Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:43.656]  Israel's nuke?
[00:19:44.136 --> 00:19:45.696]  Iran nukes, nukes, nukes.
[00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:47.097]  They took the seal off the nukes.
[00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:50.859]  Sounds like a, you know, movie, uh, with Harrison Ford.
[00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:52.219]  They're taking the seal off the nukes.
[00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:52.960]  They're gonna detonate it.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:53.900]  People go, nukes!
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.101]  They've got them!
[00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:57.282]  There are no nukes!
[00:19:57.982 --> 00:19:59.423]  But they just say nukes!
[00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:04.979]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:09.221]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:12.262]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:14.843]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:15.043 --> 00:20:23.686]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:23.886 --> 00:20:25.226]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[00:20:25.407 --> 00:20:29.548]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:30.229]  We're good to go!
[00:20:48.928 --> 00:20:50.571]  Screams and Stagnant Ponds.
[00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:53.976]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:53.996 --> 00:20:55.098]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.403 --> 00:21:01.863]  Gold.
[00:21:02.204 --> 00:21:03.484]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:09.829]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:13.831]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:16.073]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:18.414]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.554 --> 00:21:24.138]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:24.798]  We're good to go.
[00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:44.528]  Is Black Magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[00:22:08.556 --> 00:22:09.337]  I'm Tex Mars.
[00:22:09.757 --> 00:22:13.961]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener.
[00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:17.544]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[00:22:18.084 --> 00:22:26.932]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[00:22:27.532 --> 00:22:31.178]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati.
[00:22:31.439 --> 00:22:32.861]  Their mysterious symbols.
[00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:34.724]  Their hidden language.
[00:22:35.365 --> 00:22:36.247]  Encyclopedic.
[00:22:36.827 --> 00:22:37.428]  Documented.
[00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:41.796]  Codex Magicka unmask a conspiracy of immense evil.
[00:22:42.577 --> 00:22:51.847]  Please order your personal copy of Codex Magicka on the internet at PowerOfProphecy.com or simply phone toll free 1-800-234-9673.

[00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:04.670]  Thanks for tuning in to this edition of Coffee on the Air.
[00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.272]  I'm your host, Joe Java.
[00:23:06.412 --> 00:23:09.054]  Today we're talking about guilt-free, healthy coffee.
[00:23:09.334 --> 00:23:11.976]  Yes, it is possible to enjoy healthy coffee.
[00:23:12.237 --> 00:23:14.779]  And on today's episode, we're going to tell you how.
[00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:16.060]  More after this break.
[00:23:16.991 --> 00:23:20.733]  It's time to wake up and start your day on a healthy note with Gano Coffee.
[00:23:20.853 --> 00:23:31.678]  What makes Gano Coffee so special is the addition of high quality Ganoderma from the amazingly nutritious red reishi mushroom that provides energy and health to expel toxins from the body.
[00:23:31.898 --> 00:23:33.759]  For your coffee sample call toll free 866-271-3653.
[00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:39.183]  Welcome back to Coffee on the Air.
[00:23:39.403 --> 00:23:42.706]  I'm Joe Java with news that you can enjoy guilt-free coffee.
[00:23:42.806 --> 00:23:50.032]  Just visit our website, coffeeontheair.com or call us directly at 866-271-3653.
[00:23:50.412 --> 00:23:59.600]  Stay tuned for the next episode of Coffee on the Air when we discuss how agave coffee can boost your immune system and can actually help you get a good night's sleep.
[00:24:05.596 --> 00:24:15.514]  We've got Dylan Avery, one of the producers and the director of the Loose Change 2 9-11 documentary that we're carrying on Infowars.com, joining us in the third hour.
[00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.678]  Coming up next hour, we've got Professor Castle.
[00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:25.696]  Coming on to talk about John Yoo, one of Bush's top advisors, saying Bush can torture small children in front of their parents.
[00:24:26.036 --> 00:24:32.638]  Oh, by the way, Scott, don't forget to find that clip that we played last week of their exchange so we can play that on air.
[00:24:32.658 --> 00:24:37.660]  Just giving you a heads up to dig that out of the computer that's probably got, I have no idea how many clips in it.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.682]  But on this whole Iran situation, Iran's new confidence
[00:24:44.648 --> 00:24:46.750]  You know, they're just gotta be nuked.
[00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.971]  They're evil because they've got nukes.
[00:24:49.211 --> 00:25:02.581]  And Rumsfeld and others have said they don't rule out using tactical weapons, tactical thermonuclear weapons to, quote, knock out these deep bunkers, these facilities.
[00:25:03.274 --> 00:25:04.435]  And understand, there have been U.N.
[00:25:04.475 --> 00:25:05.916]  inspectors in all of them.
[00:25:05.956 --> 00:25:07.977]  They have video cameras in them.
[00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:16.303]  And all of the experts that run laboratories and plants and have made weapons for this country and other countries go, what do you mean?
[00:25:16.343 --> 00:25:17.804]  You can't make anything with that!
[00:25:18.396 --> 00:25:29.124]  But it doesn't matter, they've got a steady stream of government agents and operatives to go on TV and Christina Amanpour to misquote the Iranian president.
[00:25:29.164 --> 00:25:34.409]  Listen, last night I was on Coast to Coast AM and a couple callers called in and go, well he just threatened to nuke Israel!
[00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:40.673]  Well, what do we... Alex, I agree with you on a lot of stuff, but... A man called in and said that?
[00:25:40.713 --> 00:25:41.834]  A lady called in and said that?
[00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:42.755]  Of the calls he took?
[00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:46.338]  I mean, again, people don't hear the retraction.
[00:25:46.934 --> 00:25:49.296]  That's why Christina Amanpour did that.
[00:25:49.636 --> 00:25:51.298]  And they always do that.
[00:25:51.318 --> 00:26:05.290]  You understand CNN with ITN and others, back in the mid-90s, went and showed one starving guy up at a fence, who had a disease, trying to break into the food pantry at an aid station.
[00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.251]  They had barbed wire around it.
[00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:08.393]  And they said he was inside a camp.
[00:26:09.294 --> 00:26:10.054]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:26:10.074 --> 00:26:12.156]  Do we like being conned like this?
[00:26:12.877 --> 00:26:13.998]  Does it feel good?
[00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:22.025]  I know you're going to have debates around the water cooler or out there on the job site with people that are like, he said he'd nuke Israel!
[00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:23.365]  He said it!
[00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:25.025]  What are you, against Israel?
[00:26:28.246 --> 00:26:29.366]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:26:29.406 --> 00:26:30.386]  He did not say that.
[00:26:30.466 --> 00:26:34.187]  Most of the things you hear the Iranian President has said is not true.
[00:26:35.187 --> 00:26:37.328]  And I'm not even defending the Iranian President.
[00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:41.049]  Last night I kept trying to explain my position on Iran.
[00:26:41.089 --> 00:26:42.289]  I'm like, the top
[00:26:43.445 --> 00:26:48.131]  Chinese General, on record, last year, late last year, remember?
[00:26:48.492 --> 00:26:54.279]  He called together over a hundred top reporters, said there's going to be a press conference in one week.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.146]  Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, CNN, Time Magazine, they're all there!
[00:26:59.878 --> 00:27:17.209]  And he says, if you get involved in Taiwan, you get involved in any of our possessions, any of our national interest, anywhere in the world, we are targeting 200 of your cities and we will preemptively, that is with no provocation, without telling you, hit you first
[00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:21.077]  And kill half of your population.
[00:27:21.237 --> 00:27:24.779]  By the way, 90% of the American people live in cities.
[00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:26.320]  And 200 cities.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.582]  I mean, when you get up in the 150's, you're looking at little bitty towns.
[00:27:30.702 --> 00:27:37.886]  I mean, we're only 300 million people now, with the projections with the new midterm census coming up.
[00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:40.827]  In fact, we just crossed the 300 million mark.
[00:27:40.847 --> 00:27:43.308]  It's really higher than that with all the illegal aliens.
[00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.729]  I'd say 320 million, but who's counting?
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.142]  We're only 300 million people, and you hit 200 cities.
[00:27:50.323 --> 00:27:51.724]  He said, we'll kill half of you.
[00:27:51.744 --> 00:27:52.884]  That's a lot more than half.
[00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:56.607]  I would imagine that more than half would die.
[00:27:56.627 --> 00:27:59.148]  And then he said, we are 1,350,000,000.
[00:27:59.188 --> 00:28:00.709]  We want a war with you.
[00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:05.332]  He's the head of their military, number three in the entire government.
[00:28:07.398 --> 00:28:13.121]  And I brought it up last night and people were like, Alex, it doesn't matter, man, that Iranian president, he's just scary!
[00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:14.202]  Yeah, but he won't.
[00:28:14.362 --> 00:28:15.402]  He doesn't have A-bombs.
[00:28:15.442 --> 00:28:16.283]  He can't have them.
[00:28:16.543 --> 00:28:18.364]  This is all just hype and hysteria.
[00:28:19.004 --> 00:28:20.985]  But everybody shares the word, Iran's nukes.
[00:28:21.025 --> 00:28:24.247]  You know, Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:28:24.807 --> 00:28:28.910]  Then you read it's peaceful enrichment for reactors.
[00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:34.733]  You know, the University of Texas has actually, I've been wrong the last few years, I keep saying one reactor, they have two reactors.
[00:28:35.093 --> 00:28:36.734]  And a lot of big universities have reactors.
[00:28:37.614 --> 00:28:38.915]  We'll have them right in your neighborhood.
[00:28:38.935 --> 00:28:39.816]  You'll never even know they're there.
[00:28:40.117 --> 00:28:41.959]  Up off Palmer, North Austin, or downtown.
[00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:43.761]  You know, nuclear reactors, no big deal.
[00:28:44.742 --> 00:28:45.863]  Nobody guarding them, nothing.
[00:28:45.883 --> 00:28:46.664]  You just drive in there.
[00:28:46.684 --> 00:28:48.345]  You can do whatever you want.
[00:28:48.385 --> 00:28:48.846]  No problem.
[00:28:49.326 --> 00:28:49.747]  Seriously.
[00:28:50.448 --> 00:28:52.570]  But to make a long story short,
[00:28:54.073 --> 00:29:10.197]  If a university wants this stuff enriched, that Iran's not even allowed to enrich to have something peaceful that you can't use for weapons, different isotopes, different animal folks, it's like you ride a horse, you don't ride a, say, a Boston Terrier, it'd break its back.
[00:29:10.217 --> 00:29:11.957]  See, you can't do that with it.
[00:29:12.257 --> 00:29:12.997]  It's not a horse.
[00:29:13.057 --> 00:29:16.318]  It's like weapons-grade plutonium or uranium is a horse.
[00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:19.580]  And this is like saying that Iran is going to be able to make an A-bomb.
[00:29:19.961 --> 00:29:22.203]  Write a mouse.
[00:29:22.483 --> 00:29:23.203]  Forget a dog.
[00:29:23.243 --> 00:29:26.066]  It's like saying they can mount a mouse and ride it to town.
[00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:31.010]  But see what a university can just call up and, hey, send over some of that.
[00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.151]  I'm going to have a reactor.
[00:29:32.451 --> 00:29:34.072]  Sure, we'll deliver it next week.
[00:29:34.413 --> 00:29:35.413]  Sign a few forms.
[00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:36.654]  No big deal.
[00:29:37.455 --> 00:29:40.958]  Iran isn't even allowed to have.
[00:29:40.998 --> 00:29:42.199]  That's global government, folks.
[00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:44.601]  This is all a big lesson in global government.
[00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:46.494]  More than anything, that's what this is about.
[00:29:46.554 --> 00:29:47.595]  About hearing how the U.N.
[00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:48.156]  is the boss.
[00:29:48.437 --> 00:29:49.999]  Everyone's gotta go to the U.N.
[00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:51.261]  and see what they say.
[00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:52.824]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.305 --> 00:29:54.908]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:31:07.923 --> 00:31:14.086]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[00:31:14.387 --> 00:31:22.812]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.052 --> 00:31:30.076]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.

[00:32:12.737 --> 00:32:21.102]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[00:32:21.762 --> 00:32:29.207]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[00:32:29.707 --> 00:32:31.488]  This is real, not science fiction.
[00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:40.814]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X.com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.

[00:33:06.497 --> 00:33:08.422]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:11.649]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:24.612]  John, Stan, Mark, Paula, many others.
[00:33:25.073 --> 00:33:25.953]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:33:26.033 --> 00:33:31.555]  It's always a good idea to give the phone number out.
[00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:32.235]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:32.255 --> 00:33:32.455]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:32.536 --> 00:33:36.037]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:33:36.317 --> 00:33:42.099]  We do have the professor coming on that debated John Yoo, a literal pig demon.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.880]  And so that is coming up.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.841]  And I just can't think of a better term for them than pig demons.
[00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:49.242]  I mean, just they're pig-like demons.
[00:33:49.958 --> 00:33:52.379]  Talking about torturing children and snickering about it.
[00:33:52.439 --> 00:33:53.619]  It's just sickos.
[00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:57.921]  Jeffrey Dahmer type mindsets being openly promoted as if it's good.
[00:33:57.961 --> 00:34:00.482]  I mean, folks, they're really trying to warp our brains right now.
[00:34:00.502 --> 00:34:01.783]  This is all being scientifically done.
[00:34:02.183 --> 00:34:02.803]  That's coming up.
[00:34:03.843 --> 00:34:07.905]  But I want to just briefly get into some of the other news here.
[00:34:09.245 --> 00:34:11.846]  Some of the other news that is developing.
[00:34:11.966 --> 00:34:12.247]  U.S.
[00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:16.348]  openly tortures suspects, says report, Associated Press.
[00:34:17.048 --> 00:34:18.549]  The gauntlet has just been thrown down.
[00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:20.531]  Look at this.
[00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:22.352]  I see articles like this every day.
[00:34:22.932 --> 00:34:24.933]  They're recasting Big Brother.
[00:34:25.553 --> 00:34:26.293]  He's good.
[00:34:30.214 --> 00:34:30.935]  He's helpful.
[00:34:31.855 --> 00:34:32.575]  He's friendly.
[00:34:33.335 --> 00:34:34.296]  He's a good guy.
[00:34:35.056 --> 00:34:38.997]  A friendly Big Brother could offer a helping hand.
[00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:41.298]  That's an article out of the Irish Times.
[00:34:43.288 --> 00:34:49.276]  Federal grants bring surveillance cameras to small towns, Washington Post, everywhere.
[00:34:49.557 --> 00:34:55.966]  The face scanning, license plate reading cameras are going in, federally, financially, Defense Department program.
[00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:58.325]  Here's another one.
[00:34:58.425 --> 00:34:59.146]  Official U.S.
[00:34:59.246 --> 00:35:04.928]  agency paints dire picture of out-of-control Iraq, London Guardian, plunging into civil war.
[00:35:04.968 --> 00:35:07.789]  Well, that was what they wanted to do from the start.
[00:35:08.129 --> 00:35:12.170]  Extent of soldiers' injuries in Iraq hidden by Ministry of Defense.
[00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:15.712]  Iranian president cements Syrian alliance.
[00:35:15.812 --> 00:35:19.613]  And, of course, on top of all that, Bush administration wants Google search records.
[00:35:20.013 --> 00:35:21.194]  Records sought in U.S.
[00:35:21.274 --> 00:35:23.835]  quest to revive porn law.
[00:35:23.915 --> 00:35:24.615]  Now, listen.
[00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:37.870]  The law has already been struck down that websites have no responsibility to keep teenagers or children from accessing porn on the internet.
[00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:48.080]  And as out of control as it is on the web, I don't like being sent, you know, emails that say, your mortgage numbers, or your bank, or, hi, it's your mother, and you click on it, and it's a woman with a horse.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.023]  I mean, you know, we've all been on the internet, run into that.
[00:35:53.475 --> 00:35:56.039]  That could all be dealt with through ISPs.
[00:35:56.139 --> 00:35:58.722]  If you actually complain and do something, people will get shut down.
[00:35:58.962 --> 00:35:59.883]  But nobody does that.
[00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:04.930]  Instead, the government, I'm going to talk about this later more, prances around.
[00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.652]  Meanwhile, this is the same Pentagon.
[00:36:08.536 --> 00:36:19.200]  This is the same White House where we have congressional hearings where they admit hundreds of thousands of kidnapped women and children into sex slavery and physical slavery, work camp slavery, public.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.442]  Chicago Tribune, MSNBC, Associated Press just three weeks ago.
[00:36:23.462 --> 00:36:24.262]  Remember all those articles?
[00:36:25.578 --> 00:36:26.839]  And it's just, ah, so what?
[00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:28.480]  Ah, who cares where the kids are?
[00:36:28.721 --> 00:36:29.441]  I mean, just public.
[00:36:29.801 --> 00:36:32.704]  Public, massive, twilight zone level, totally insane.
[00:36:33.504 --> 00:36:53.981]  And meanwhile, uh-oh, we've got to, uh, we've got to have all the search records of Google, of everyone, uh, without a warrant, just set the precedent when the law they're talking about has been struck down by the Supreme Court to make sure, uh, and to get some statistics about, uh, if you're searching for random other issues, like you,
[00:36:54.641 --> 00:36:58.602]  You know, type in, say, auto loan, are you getting porn?
[00:36:58.642 --> 00:36:59.722]  And I'm here to tell you, no.
[00:36:59.782 --> 00:37:02.403]  You type in auto loan, you do not get porn.
[00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:07.724]  But it's opening the email that you get the unwanted porn.
[00:37:07.764 --> 00:37:14.625]  It's a total red herring, an excuse to go in there and people just hear children porn, protect children.
[00:37:15.085 --> 00:37:16.546]  It has nothing to do with it.
[00:37:18.186 --> 00:37:19.926]  Parents should control this.
[00:37:20.606 --> 00:37:23.287]  I mean, there is no way in the world
[00:37:24.048 --> 00:37:31.790]  That my children are going to have computers unattended till they are, you know, at least partway through high school.
[00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:40.672]  And I don't care if you see 10 year olds on the street with their own personal handheld Palm Pilots, surfing to their heart's content.
[00:37:41.012 --> 00:37:46.493]  Listen, my children aren't going to be getting cars till they're a little bit older, or until they've proven they can drive safely.
[00:37:46.793 --> 00:37:49.414]  I have no idea why I was allowed to have a car at 16.
[00:37:49.574 --> 00:37:51.074]  I mean, I was a danger.
[00:37:53.293 --> 00:37:55.375]  It's just, you've got to gauge the child's responsibility.
[00:37:55.395 --> 00:37:56.075]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:57.476 --> 00:38:02.680]  Or the other answer is, is have them driving tractors when they're 10, and driving work trucks on a ranch.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.642]  That's how it used to grow up, and they'll have responsibility by the time they're 16.
[00:38:06.062 --> 00:38:07.623]  But don't just... Side issue!
[00:38:07.643 --> 00:38:11.846]  The point is, folks, again, I'm just going to cover this down.
[00:38:11.866 --> 00:38:15.309]  We've got Debbie Morrow on hold, spent about five minutes with her, but let me just talk about this Google thing right now.
[00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.530]  Because this is so amazing.
[00:38:19.311 --> 00:38:29.134]  Bush has Arlen Specter, Bush has his chief counsels, he has his advisors, all saying Bush is above the law.
[00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:30.615]  Bush can order torture of children.
[00:38:31.595 --> 00:38:32.335]  Think how sick that is.
[00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:38.757]  We can torture children in front of their parents, but we want to have all your search records to keep kids safe when it doesn't even do anything.
[00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:46.100]  They say just so they know data-wise, so they can get search engines in trouble if they're directing people wrong, which they don't do.
[00:38:49.506 --> 00:38:54.332]  This is just federal control into everything you've searched, everything you're doing.
[00:38:54.352 --> 00:38:55.553]  And let me just give you a news flash.
[00:38:55.954 --> 00:38:57.215]  They've already got all that.
[00:38:57.256 --> 00:39:04.985]  They've got hubs built into all the telecommunications grids at 96 by federal law, upwards of 10 billion bucks of them.
[00:39:05.993 --> 00:39:09.256]  Part of that law was that every cell phone be satellite tracked by October 1st, 2001.
[00:39:09.836 --> 00:39:11.017]  They passed it in 96.
[00:39:11.958 --> 00:39:13.419]  That was five years before.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.001]  And then now all your cell phones are tracking you.
[00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:19.284]  Just try calling up with your cell phone and going, hey, tell me where I'm at.
[00:39:19.885 --> 00:39:23.768]  And if you've got it on your service, the government can already do it, but only some services let you do it.
[00:39:24.048 --> 00:39:26.070]  And they'll tell you the exact where you're at.
[00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.051]  You're at the corner of Washington and Liberty.
[00:39:29.312 --> 00:39:30.713]  You're at the corner of Maine and 24th.
[00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:33.477]  I mean, I was, again, up in Fort Worth.
[00:39:34.078 --> 00:39:37.205]  So, number one, number one, they already got all that data.
[00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:37.826]  Okay?
[00:39:37.926 --> 00:39:39.189]  I mean, that's number one.
[00:39:40.522 --> 00:39:42.804]  Number two, all they're doing is announcing it.
[00:39:42.824 --> 00:39:50.709]  They're announcing, we have total power, we can spy on you, it's for your own good, it's to stop Al-Qaeda, Bin Laden wants to call America, shouldn't we be able to listen?
[00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:52.590]  They don't even need a warrant for that, folks.
[00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.432]  The FISA isn't even a warrant, it's a rubber stamp.
[00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:55.452]  They didn't even do that.
[00:39:55.993 --> 00:40:02.317]  I got a big stack here of farmers being watched by NSA satellites, being used by local governments, being tapped into.
[00:40:03.544 --> 00:40:04.625]  War protesters.
[00:40:04.865 --> 00:40:09.847]  Oh, oh, oh, two vegans went and peacefully protested in front of a Honey Ham shop.
[00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:10.767]  This is mainstream news.
[00:40:12.848 --> 00:40:15.609]  Homeland Security pulled up and said that it was terrorism.
[00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:18.390]  They didn't have a permit to protest on the street corner.
[00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.831]  They weren't even on the business property.
[00:40:20.974 --> 00:40:22.315]  And they arrested them as terrorists.
[00:40:22.515 --> 00:40:26.038]  Folks, that is the Associated Press reporting it like it's normal and dry.
[00:40:26.459 --> 00:40:31.022]  Imagine, you're protesting the Honey Ham place, saying pigs are abused in these little boxes.
[00:40:31.343 --> 00:40:33.264]  Now, again, folks, I'm not an animal rights activist.
[00:40:33.284 --> 00:40:34.085]  I'm not even getting into that.
[00:40:34.125 --> 00:40:36.067]  My point is, they got a right to do that.
[00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.610]  Folks, I was on George Norrie last night.
[00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:45.194]  I had 127 articles that I physically went through my stacks from the last few weeks, because I print everything as a hard copy.
[00:40:46.015 --> 00:40:49.578]  All these mainstream news articles, and I got through about 10 of them, and he said, okay, stop, stop.
[00:40:50.416 --> 00:41:05.905]  And it was just NSA listening to everything, NSA watching reporters, NSA using it for political control, FBI harassing war protesters, harassing gun groups, just military taking photos of citizens all over the country.
[00:41:07.366 --> 00:41:07.706]  Again!
[00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:12.929]  But the national debate is about Bin Laden calling America, are we allowed to listen?
[00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:16.431]  So of course we're supposed to listen to Bin Laden!
[00:41:16.711 --> 00:41:18.472]  What's wrong with you liberals?
[00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:26.342]  So, the new thing is, Bush administration wants Google search records, records sought in U.S.
[00:41:26.402 --> 00:41:30.644]  quest to rein porn law, or revive porn law.
[00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:35.187]  I just, it is so unbelievable, folks.
[00:41:35.947 --> 00:41:37.648]  It is so unbelievable.
[00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:43.632]  And, it's just, we want access to everything you're doing, no more warrants, no more nothing.
[00:41:43.832 --> 00:41:49.135]  They're already doing it, they just want to now openly do it so they can start using it.
[00:41:49.853 --> 00:41:54.717]  You see, it's one thing to be doing it, now they want to use it on an everyday basis.
[00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:58.260]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.261]  It is unbelievable.
[00:41:59.321 --> 00:42:00.822]  And this should drive down Google's stock.
[00:42:00.862 --> 00:42:01.823]  Of course it won't.
[00:42:01.843 --> 00:42:03.024]  People should be upset about this.
[00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:06.347]  People should be really demanding.
[00:42:06.707 --> 00:42:15.975]  Google's already worked with China to selectively edit where you can't even do searches in China, in-country, through those web ports and hubs.
[00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.792]  It's just like MySpace with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:42:18.872 --> 00:42:22.877]  Live time, you criticize Rupert Murdoch, you type, nothing will post.
[00:42:23.357 --> 00:42:36.211]  You talk about any of Rupert Murdoch's CityCorps holdings, or talk about any other competition, you can't type it on your own supposed blog, because it ain't your own blog!
[00:42:38.007 --> 00:42:46.674]  They came and bought up a 38 million size community, and I've talked to the Myspacers walking around, falling all over themselves, talking about how trendy they are.
[00:42:46.694 --> 00:42:49.216]  I mean, they'll actually walk over to you and go, it's the most trendy thing ever.
[00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:51.037]  I'm like, yeah, man, it's real trendy.
[00:42:51.578 --> 00:42:52.659]  Go somewhere else now.
[00:42:52.759 --> 00:42:53.639]  You know, it's no good.
[00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:58.903]  And he's like, well, maybe, yeah, he's doing that, but so what?
[00:42:58.923 --> 00:43:01.526]  It's just like, totally trendy, man.
[00:43:01.626 --> 00:43:02.546]  Totally trendy.
[00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:05.088]  I'm sorry, it was trendy.
[00:43:05.128 --> 00:43:05.789]  It was fun.
[00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:06.369]  It was good.
[00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:06.990]  It ain't now.
[00:43:08.206 --> 00:43:08.647]  Okay?
[00:43:09.707 --> 00:43:12.910]  We have the power by where we go, what we do, and what we support.
[00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:16.934]  And so when something starts doing things like this, leave it!
[00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:18.675]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[00:43:18.955 --> 00:43:21.317]  Debbie Morrow, thanks for holding there graciously.
[00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:31.106]  Haven't had you on in a week or so, and I believe in Made in America products, and I believe in New Millennium Concepts, Made in America, highest quality, gravity-fed filters.
[00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:35.770]  You also are the national distributor, meaning at the lowest price, on the British Bergfeld.
[00:43:37.106 --> 00:43:38.888]  And you've got a bunch of deals for us, Debbie.
[00:43:39.729 --> 00:43:46.196]  Yes, I do, and thank you for having me, and I don't mind holding it all, because it gives me an opportunity to hear you.
[00:43:46.276 --> 00:43:50.881]  Well, I know you're busy, but just be honest with me, Debbie, because I want your real response.
[00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:51.742]  Okay.
[00:43:51.802 --> 00:43:52.963]  I mean, I really want what you think.
[00:43:54.004 --> 00:43:55.826]  Did any of what I was just saying make sense?
[00:43:55.846 --> 00:43:57.388]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:43:57.428 --> 00:43:58.609]  Do you see what I'm getting at?
[00:43:59.847 --> 00:44:10.622]  Oh yeah, I mean I wish I could listen more, but absolutely, because it doesn't have anything to do with whether or not you believe in the issues, it's whether or not we have the right to protest.
[00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:14.948]  You know, I mean, when did we lose the right to be Americans?
[00:44:15.939 --> 00:44:20.422]  You know, stand on the corner with a picket sign or something, and that's the whole issue.
[00:44:20.822 --> 00:44:29.708]  It's not whether or not you believe in what these people are picking about, but we do believe that we have the right to do it, you know, and that's what's been taken away from us.
[00:44:30.428 --> 00:44:32.470]  We don't have the right to be Americans anymore.
[00:44:33.453 --> 00:44:37.015]  And then they say it's to stop Al Qaeda, but it has nothing to do with it.
[00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:38.856]  Right.
[00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:45.260]  I mean, I have over 120 articles here just in the last two weeks that I have in a stack here, Debbie.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:52.724]  And none of it has anything to do with the forked tail, cloven hoofed Bin Laden.
[00:44:53.204 --> 00:44:53.504]  Right.
[00:44:53.905 --> 00:44:54.965]  Well, and that's what they do.
[00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:59.908]  They say, well, if we do it to Bin Laden, we have to be able to do it to everybody.
[00:45:00.413 --> 00:45:06.237]  And that's such nonsense, because if they really wanted to get rid of him, they could get rid of him, you know?
[00:45:06.617 --> 00:45:15.103]  I mean, it's like, you know, they... Well, number three at the CIA said, we don't want to kill him, we don't want to capture him.
[00:45:15.243 --> 00:45:16.524]  Well, yeah, because he works for them.
[00:45:17.564 --> 00:45:18.985]  Debbie, tell us about the specials.
[00:45:19.225 --> 00:45:21.467]  Well, we have the Berkey specials.
[00:45:21.507 --> 00:45:29.192]  We have the big Berkeys, all the stainless steel models are available with free Berkey sport bottles.
[00:45:29.636 --> 00:45:58.128]  For being an Alex Jones listener or if you get the Royal Berkey, Imperial Berkey or Crown Berkey you can get a KDF shower filter instead of sport bottles or you can you know mix and match we can figure it out but main thing is we really want to have good drinking water with the Berkeys and I really want to implore people to please call get your orders in don't wait until there's another disaster in a couple of months you know I mean things are kind of
[00:45:58.683 --> 00:46:06.446]  You know, laid back right now, people are lulled into apathy because nothing bad is happening, and so they don't think they need a Berkey.
[00:46:06.907 --> 00:46:11.289]  But you need a Berkey for every single day, not just for an emergency.
[00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:16.591]  Go to the EPA's own website and see the allowable levels.
[00:46:17.655 --> 00:46:18.836]  We're good to go.
[00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:45.095]  Made in America, gravity filters, new standard, and of course you've got the sports bottles where you get like five of them and they're $20 apiece.
[00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:48.316]  You buy these at the camping store, they're $35 apiece.
[00:46:48.896 --> 00:46:55.178]  You've also got free gifts like sheltering in place DVDs, how to make your house safe from chemical, radiological, biological.
[00:46:55.839 --> 00:46:58.960]  You've got just so much other great stuff, Debbie.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.601]  Folks, you need to give New Millennium Concepts a call and it's 1-888-GOOD.
[00:47:04.563 --> 00:47:05.023]  803-4438-8888.
[00:47:05.043 --> 00:47:07.687]  803-4438.
[00:47:08.969 --> 00:47:12.414]  The biggest discounts out there when you tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:16.961]  Not only is it made in America, the best out there, what I've been using for many years before they were sponsors.
[00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:22.092]  It is, of course, also you get an even bigger discount when you tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:47:22.332 --> 00:47:26.796]  Go to Berkeywater.com to order off their secure shopping cart.
[00:47:26.836 --> 00:47:28.837]  Tell them in the comment section what free gift you want.
[00:47:28.857 --> 00:47:29.578]  They have those listed.
[00:47:29.958 --> 00:47:34.901]  Or order via the safe secure shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:35.662 --> 00:47:39.605]  Debbie, I tell you, I just hope people will give you a call.
[00:47:39.725 --> 00:47:43.968]  And this is an area where we can at least take control of this area of our lives.
[00:47:44.568 --> 00:47:45.909]  And water is 70% of the body.
[00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:53.112]  Right, and if you think you're safe because you're on rainwater or well water, you know, don't believe it.
[00:47:53.172 --> 00:47:57.714]  Yesterday when I was driving, you know, they were like doing the sky with the chemtrails.
[00:47:58.594 --> 00:48:02.535]  And I literally saw a cloud that had a rainbow in it.
[00:48:03.676 --> 00:48:05.396]  And I know that was from the chemtrails.
[00:48:05.936 --> 00:48:09.998]  You know, and that oily substance they put in the sky and it gets in the clouds.
[00:48:10.118 --> 00:48:13.559]  If we ever got rain again in Dallas, it'd be a miracle.
[00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:29.935]  You know, people think, well I'm on a well, or I'm on rainwater, so I don't need a Berkey, but if you go ahead and make some ice water, make some ice cubes and water, put it in a clear pitcher and let it melt down, and then take a look at how brown the bottom of your glass is.
[00:48:30.035 --> 00:48:31.376]  Oh, listen, that's what I told people to do.
[00:48:31.436 --> 00:48:38.221]  Take tap water, put it in an ice tray, and then look at the sediment, then make it with Berkey water, and there's not going to be any sediment.
[00:48:38.481 --> 00:48:40.162]  Debbie, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:48:40.222 --> 00:48:41.023]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:48:41.543 --> 00:48:44.085]  I really appreciate, you bet, I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:48:44.485 --> 00:48:45.646]  Folks, it's up to you.
[00:48:45.666 --> 00:48:49.669]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.732]  I mean, we're poisoning ourselves with what is in this water.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.083]  888-803-4438 or InfoWars.com.
[00:48:58.103 --> 00:49:02.847]  Go check out the Better Living Through Clean Water section on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:03.367 --> 00:49:08.271]  And as the orders come in same day, we fax them up to Dallas and they ship them out to you or you can get it directly from them.
[00:49:09.152 --> 00:49:11.354]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[00:49:11.394 --> 00:49:11.955]  Thanks for holding.
[00:49:11.995 --> 00:49:12.575]  Go ahead, John.
[00:49:13.156 --> 00:49:13.656]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:49:14.136 --> 00:49:20.702]  I was at my local friendly neighborhood Veterans Hospital, Administration Hospital yesterday.
[00:49:21.408 --> 00:49:24.150]  I'm getting my medication with some other buddies of mine.
[00:49:25.971 --> 00:49:47.764]  I was looking through it, through my medication, and my friend was, and he found, we found embossed in some of our pills was a small metallic substance, like we broke it apart and was looking at it, and some of the, I think they're RFIDs, like in the medication or something.
[00:49:48.502 --> 00:49:50.023]  I just thought that was interesting.
[00:49:50.183 --> 00:49:59.286]  Actually, Viagra just announced they're going to put chips in the pill bottles, and there is a discussion of putting chips in pills.
[00:49:59.326 --> 00:50:00.987]  You can type that into Google, you'll find it.
[00:50:01.007 --> 00:50:02.547]  Of course, Bush now wants to know what you're typing in.
[00:50:02.567 --> 00:50:03.647]  It has a chilling effect.
[00:50:03.688 --> 00:50:04.768]  It's meant to scare us, folks.
[00:50:04.948 --> 00:50:07.549]  They should be scared, because we're getting wise to the globalist.
[00:50:08.249 --> 00:50:10.770]  He's just a puppet.
[00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:12.931]  What type of medication is it?
[00:50:13.351 --> 00:50:14.491]  It was a painkiller.
[00:50:16.431 --> 00:50:17.411]  Percocet painkiller.
[00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:21.353]  Yeah, they do use RFID in the bottles.
[00:50:21.453 --> 00:50:27.715]  I've been reading on them some of those, what is it, Class 3 narcotics, but prescription narcotics.
[00:50:27.735 --> 00:50:31.036]  Percocet's one of them, but I didn't know it was in the pills.
[00:50:31.856 --> 00:50:39.759]  Yeah, he found it in his pill, but also there's some other stories I have about some of my friends who were in Afghanistan and Iraq about
[00:50:40.652 --> 00:50:42.834]  Having snipers come after them and stuff like that.
[00:50:42.894 --> 00:50:46.936]  I don't know if you heard about Duba, the sniper, and Pashtun.
[00:50:47.016 --> 00:50:47.997]  Well, yeah, stay there.
[00:50:48.017 --> 00:50:48.898]  I'll let you finish up, John.
[00:50:48.978 --> 00:50:52.980]  And Stan, Mark, Paula, and others are coming up in about 10 minutes in the next hour if we take some of these calls.
[00:50:54.141 --> 00:51:01.066]  We're going to have an interesting guest on you don't want to miss.
[00:51:02.427 --> 00:51:05.309]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.025 --> 00:51:07.306]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.506 --> 00:51:13.249]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.529 --> 00:51:18.792]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.072 --> 00:51:20.693]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[00:51:20.933 --> 00:51:23.235]  The program for world domination has blown wide open.
[00:51:23.395 --> 00:51:27.179]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.439 --> 00:51:32.084]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.184 --> 00:51:34.947]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:51:35.247 --> 00:51:38.430]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:40.312]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:52:09.257 --> 00:52:22.221]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:25.843]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.183 --> 00:52:36.650]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:37.430]  That's right!
[00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:44.715]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[00:54:01.618 --> 00:54:06.539]  Look, I should have gone to close earlier.
[00:54:06.639 --> 00:54:09.700]  I want to get to everybody here as quickly as possible.
[00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:14.843]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Tennessee.
[00:54:14.923 --> 00:54:15.984]  John, you're on the air.
[00:54:16.004 --> 00:54:19.447]  Finish up what you were saying, some of the stories over with your friends in Afghanistan.
[00:54:19.867 --> 00:54:36.059]  Yeah, I have some friends who got back from Afghanistan, and while they were over there, told me stories about they, you know, they wouldn't run into resistance, but all of a sudden they'd get calls over the radio of, you know, like guys called, you know, Pashtun and, you know, speaking English.
[00:54:36.159 --> 00:54:36.839]  Oh, we know where you are.
[00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:37.420]  We're going to kill you.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:37.980]  We're going to get you.
[00:54:38.841 --> 00:54:42.305]  And for those that don't know, that is mainstream European news and it never is on U.S.
[00:54:42.325 --> 00:54:42.786]  news.
[00:54:42.886 --> 00:54:43.466]  They've called Israelis
[00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:55.943]  Over and over again, dressed up like Arabs, shooting Marines.
[00:54:55.983 --> 00:55:00.107]  The Marines will catch them, beat them up, and they're ordered to release them.
[00:55:00.127 --> 00:55:01.329]  And, you know, they take their clothes off.
[00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:04.592]  They're all Massad or Shin Bet, big Star of the Davids all over them.
[00:55:05.213 --> 00:55:07.155]  And the same thing is down in Basra.
[00:55:07.195 --> 00:55:07.676]  They caught MI6.
[00:55:08.977 --> 00:55:17.064]  And I say in my sixth SAS is assigned to them, Special Air Services, dressed up in fake beards, driving around with car bombs, shooting cops, shooting our allies.
[00:55:17.544 --> 00:55:27.873]  It's because the PNAC document, the Israeli document of 83, even before that, says civil war, balkanization, they want a problem to stay there.
[00:55:28.153 --> 00:55:30.615]  So you're saying your buddies who were over there are starting to figure that out?
[00:55:30.955 --> 00:55:36.660]  Yeah, and there's one, every time there's an Israeli advisor in their company or platoon,
[00:55:37.475 --> 00:55:38.397]  They always get ambushed.
[00:55:38.477 --> 00:55:46.975]  Every time they go into an area that's not supposed to have anybody in it, it's totally cleared out and set up with traps and everything.
[00:55:47.015 --> 00:55:48.558]  It's insane.
[00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:48.939]  It looks like...
[00:55:49.463 --> 00:55:53.485]  Literally, the Israelis are just promulgating more terror, more stuff going on.
[00:55:53.525 --> 00:55:56.027]  It's because the Arabs aren't even fighting, my friend.
[00:55:57.948 --> 00:55:59.068]  There isn't even a war.
[00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:08.734]  Listen, there are real bombings going on with some real killing, but what will happen is our government, or the Israelis and the British, and they've been caught, will carry out a bombing against one group, say, of Shia.
[00:56:09.354 --> 00:56:15.858]  Then they really will go run and attack some Sunnis, or they stir it up.
[00:56:16.485 --> 00:56:18.606]  Well, Blackwater doesn't have any Israeli advisors.
[00:56:18.887 --> 00:56:23.950]  And once they kicked them out of their ranks, they haven't had any sneak attacks.
[00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:27.513]  They haven't had as many deaths as the Marines have.
[00:56:27.573 --> 00:56:30.274]  If people have family, write to them.
[00:56:31.215 --> 00:56:33.116]  You don't have to take orders from a foreign nation.
[00:56:33.176 --> 00:56:34.978]  Get the Israelis out of your platoons.
[00:56:35.018 --> 00:56:35.778]  Get them out of your groups.
[00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:39.140]  Well, I mean, it was Israelis predominantly.
[00:56:39.321 --> 00:56:41.162]  And this is just the facts, folks.
[00:56:41.202 --> 00:56:45.705]  Taking the photos of the idiots like Grainer in England, torturing people.
[00:56:46.528 --> 00:56:47.088]  I mean, why?
[00:56:47.168 --> 00:56:48.909]  Why aren't the people taking the photos in trouble?
[00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:52.991]  Let's start putting two and two together.
[00:56:53.011 --> 00:56:54.291]  See, see, people don't understand.
[00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:57.593]  Do the globalists make more money where they're a year or twenty?
[00:56:58.953 --> 00:57:00.134]  See, we think we're failing.
[00:57:00.194 --> 00:57:02.454]  No, man, the war on drugs is succeeding.
[00:57:02.494 --> 00:57:05.776]  The more drugs, the more people in prison, the more the police state, it's working.
[00:57:06.116 --> 00:57:08.197]  See, failing is winning for the globalists.
[00:57:08.557 --> 00:57:11.498]  Failing in Iraq, failing in Afghanistan is winning.
[00:57:11.538 --> 00:57:12.639]  People don't understand that.
[00:57:13.959 --> 00:57:16.060]  The troops better start figuring that out.
[00:57:17.845 --> 00:57:23.709]  Are the people you talk to over there, your comrades, are they aware of how bad DU is?
[00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:27.391]  The ones who got back are.
[00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:28.752]  I have a few buddies who are sick.
[00:57:28.792 --> 00:57:34.336]  One of my buddies gave his company commander a 9-11 road to tyranny.
[00:57:34.536 --> 00:57:35.597]  The man sat down and cried.
[00:57:37.438 --> 00:57:39.219]  He wrote me and said this guy sat down and cried.
[00:57:42.721 --> 00:57:46.244]  Really, I think it's our responsibility as the people back here in the rear
[00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.950]  Get the troops out.
[00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.491]  Do something.
[00:57:48.591 --> 00:57:57.094]  We have to... Well, I'll tell you, crying is the real response of a real man when he realizes murdering terrorists are in control of the government and everything's a complete fraud.
[00:57:57.114 --> 00:57:58.315]  Yeah.
[00:57:58.655 --> 00:58:09.400]  But I'll tell you, the good news is the people are waking up and even if the globalists carry off a nuke in this country, all the king's horses and all the king's men aren't going to be able to put the new world order back together again.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.561]  I'm telling you, they've already lost and they're just starting to figure it out.
[00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:15.062]  They're just starting to figure it out.
[00:58:15.482 --> 00:58:16.683]  Bunch of arrogant trash.
[00:58:17.483 --> 00:58:18.985]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:58:19.005 --> 00:58:19.945]  I appreciate the call.
[00:58:21.307 --> 00:58:25.911]  The facts are the facts, and find out what's in the... I bet I know what made him cry.
[00:58:26.672 --> 00:58:30.595]  FEMA saying our founding fathers are terrorists, America's bad, and all Christians are terrorists.
[00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:32.257]  Oh yeah, that's what they're teaching.
[00:58:32.657 --> 00:58:35.940]  They're not teaching the police that the Arabs are bad.
[00:58:37.081 --> 00:58:40.505]  They're teaching them that red-blooded Americans are.
[00:58:41.923 --> 00:58:44.864]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:44.904 --> 00:58:45.165]  Big Brother.
[00:58:45.185 --> 00:58:45.985]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:46.005 --> 00:58:46.725]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:46.745 --> 00:58:47.105]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.284 --> 00:59:05.185]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.205 --> 00:59:09.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.027 --> 00:59:14.130]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:17.611]  This is your wartime transmission against the New World Order.
[00:59:18.192 --> 00:59:22.574]  We are the organic, natural response to the tyrants.
[00:59:23.555 --> 00:59:31.939]  We are engaging in special warfare with the truth at point-blank range at the local level across the country, defending this country, exposing the terrorists.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:32.960]  We are
[00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:38.314]  In a figure of speech, swinging our muskets, ladies and gentlemen, against the enemy.
[00:59:38.354 --> 00:59:39.935]  We are at point-blank range.
[00:59:40.055 --> 00:59:41.176]  Join us in the fight.
[00:59:41.196 --> 00:59:42.797]  There is plenty to go around.
[00:59:42.897 --> 00:59:44.578]  We are completely surrounded.
[00:59:44.698 --> 00:59:45.039]  Good.
[00:59:45.399 --> 00:59:47.040]  Don't let any of them escape.
[00:59:48.481 --> 00:59:50.182]  This is just for all the marbles.
[00:59:50.282 --> 00:59:51.223]  Point-blank range.
[00:59:51.303 --> 00:59:52.544]  Get past the propaganda.
[00:59:52.924 --> 00:59:53.704]  Face the facts.
[00:59:53.845 --> 00:59:54.825]  Face the reality.
[00:59:55.185 --> 00:59:55.966]  Engage them.
[00:59:56.266 --> 00:59:57.747]  You do not have a choice.
[00:59:57.847 --> 01:00:00.309]  Licking their boots will only ensure your destruction.
[01:00:01.232 --> 01:00:03.233]  Alright, let's go to Mark in Texas.
[01:00:03.293 --> 01:00:04.213]  Mark, go ahead, welcome.
[01:00:05.113 --> 01:00:06.894]  Well, Alex, good to talk to you today.
[01:00:06.914 --> 01:00:14.616]  Hey, if you and I were to talk, we would certainly agree about this a whole lot more than we disagree.
[01:00:15.096 --> 01:00:20.417]  And we do have a terrible trend here, and the whole point is, what are you going to do to stay ahead of the trend?
[01:00:20.457 --> 01:00:23.978]  How can you actually profit from what's coming down?
[01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:25.979]  You don't have a radio on, do you?
[01:00:26.439 --> 01:00:27.219]  No, I do not.
[01:00:27.239 --> 01:00:28.280]  Okay, it's just echoing.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.180]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:00:30.149 --> 01:00:33.832]  Okay, well you, for one, you have figured out how to profit from what's coming down.
[01:00:34.433 --> 01:00:43.720]  You know, for one thing, you've got a lot of advertisement on there, you make a lot of money off of what's going on, so congratulations on that.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.723]  No, no, put them on hold, put them on hold.
[01:00:47.763 --> 01:00:50.085]  Let's counter each thing one point at a time.
[01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:54.048]  That's a nice little passive-aggressive thing, and I can tell where it's going.
[01:00:54.328 --> 01:00:57.411]  So before you dole out some more bills, some more chum,
[01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:00.009]  Let me just say this to you.
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.870]  Number one, there's nothing wrong with making money if it's done morally.
[01:01:04.991 --> 01:01:10.913]  Number two, if you really want to be honest, I wish the Genesis Network had made $10 million.
[01:01:10.973 --> 01:01:12.213]  Unfortunately, it hasn't.
[01:01:12.733 --> 01:01:20.615]  In the aggregate in seven years, since its inception from another failed network before it, it has actually lost money in the aggregate.
[01:01:20.755 --> 01:01:24.877]  I mean, if you really want to know the numbers, the network has not turned a profit until the last year.
[01:01:24.957 --> 01:01:25.857]  You are a buffoon.
[01:01:26.537 --> 01:01:27.358]  Why don't you do the math?
[01:01:27.398 --> 01:01:40.505]  Why don't you call the network up and buy some advertising, and then listen to how many advertisers there are, and figure out how much it costs just for our $5,000 a month satellites that we've got two up.
[01:01:41.318 --> 01:01:43.860]  Why don't you learn what a big staff cost?
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.843]  Here in my little office in Texas, total now I've got 8 employees.
[01:01:49.304 --> 01:01:52.085]  Right here in this office right now there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 people.
[01:01:53.006 --> 01:01:54.707]  Their cars are lined up right there.
[01:01:54.747 --> 01:01:55.668]  They have families.
[01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:56.749]  They have to eat.
[01:01:57.609 --> 01:01:57.990]  Okay?
[01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:04.474]  So, countering what you do, and I wish, because all it is is gas in my fuel tank.
[01:02:04.514 --> 01:02:10.278]  If we had a lot of money, which we really need, then I could do even more.
[01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:12.491]  Okay, I could do a lot more.
[01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:14.872]  I love fighting the New World Order.
[01:02:14.952 --> 01:02:16.712]  I get a thrill out of waking people up.
[01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:24.594]  I'll probably be killed someday for what I do while little coward whiners like you go around sniping at people.
[01:02:25.214 --> 01:02:28.355]  Now, if you got something you disagree with, buddy, you put it on the table.
[01:02:28.815 --> 01:02:32.415]  But don't sit there and give me a bunch of tripe, okay?
[01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:34.996]  Don't even sit there and try it with me.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.140]  Alright?
[01:02:36.401 --> 01:02:37.181]  Makes me sick.
[01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:38.582]  Now go ahead and finish what you were saying.
[01:02:38.602 --> 01:02:41.324]  How about you saw how you sold out the Gray family?
[01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.025]  There you go.
[01:02:42.045 --> 01:02:49.750]  And you notice, thanks for the call, yesterday another one of them called in here with a total made-up fable.
[01:02:50.751 --> 01:02:52.472]  And they don't care if stuff's a fable.
[01:02:52.893 --> 01:02:54.514]  And this is because we're hurting them bad.
[01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:57.796]  But the globalists don't even have to come out and attack me.
[01:02:58.196 --> 01:03:02.960]  They can put out this info and then these totally unhappy nobodies
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.763]  Can go out and do whatever they want.
[01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:07.485]  And imagine being Alex Jones.
[01:03:07.525 --> 01:03:08.426]  Being in Austin, Texas.
[01:03:08.446 --> 01:03:09.447]  Being on the Genesis Network.
[01:03:09.848 --> 01:03:11.930]  And having parasites.
[01:03:12.171 --> 01:03:16.396]  A parasite that has moved down here and that has tried to set up an operation.
[01:03:17.237 --> 01:03:21.603]  And that has put out lies about me that I was an idiot enough to even put up with.
[01:03:22.316 --> 01:03:32.259]  And then to see the fruit of their lies, and then to see them literally trying to sit upon the back of this network, and feed on us and do bad things.
[01:03:32.399 --> 01:03:33.719]  Let me just tell you something, all of you.
[01:03:33.999 --> 01:03:42.582]  You are not going to stop us, and we are not afraid of any of the New World Order's minions, and we're going to move forward, and we're going to expose the globalists.
[01:03:42.842 --> 01:03:44.182]  You want to talk about the Iran War?
[01:03:44.202 --> 01:03:46.683]  You want to talk about the Bush administration saying they can torture children?
[01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:47.923]  Let's talk about it.
[01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:51.064]  You want to suck your thumb and be a bunch of trailer trash?
[01:03:51.104 --> 01:03:51.484]  Go ahead.
[01:03:54.727 --> 01:03:57.570]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.412]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:04.437]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.777 --> 01:04:11.524]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:13.806]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.026 --> 01:04:16.868]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.948 --> 01:04:21.611]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.812 --> 01:04:26.215]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.475 --> 01:04:33.680]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.941 --> 01:04:36.362]  Discover the documentary through yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:03.705]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:12.971]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:15.172]  Into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:21.256]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:21.476 --> 01:05:28.119]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:35.163]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[01:05:53.106 --> 01:06:01.768]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[01:06:02.108 --> 01:06:06.368]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:06:07.189 --> 01:06:11.129]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:06:11.469 --> 01:06:16.510]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:20.711]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like joint care,
[01:06:20.991 --> 01:06:21.611]  We're good to go!
[01:06:45.545 --> 01:06:48.548]  3-8-4-1 to learn more.
[01:06:49.669 --> 01:06:50.130]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:06:50.330 --> 01:07:01.020]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:04.604]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:13.334 --> 01:07:18.677]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight, blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[01:07:19.138 --> 01:07:22.139]  From Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California.
[01:07:22.159 --> 01:07:24.461]  From Kansas City, Missouri to Austin, Texas.
[01:07:24.481 --> 01:07:27.663]  From Pensacola, Florida to Rochester, New York.
[01:07:27.783 --> 01:07:30.484]  Gaining more and more affiliates all the time.
[01:07:30.544 --> 01:07:34.827]  From Montana to places like Needles, California.
[01:07:35.467 --> 01:07:36.428]  There at the three corners.
[01:07:36.508 --> 01:07:38.649]  It's just so exciting to be getting so many new affiliates.
[01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:40.190]  Because really,
[01:07:41.095 --> 01:07:42.375]  We were a little bit ahead of our time.
[01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:49.858]  It was wild to talk about NSA and black site torture programs six, seven years ago, and yet they were going on before Bush got in.
[01:07:49.878 --> 01:07:51.458]  This is just kind of the coming out.
[01:07:52.038 --> 01:07:56.740]  Dictatorships of the elite are not built and manifested overnight.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:07.463]  They build slowly, generally, as societies rot, but the slow-growing tumors are generally the worst when you talk about civilizations and societies.
[01:08:09.464 --> 01:08:14.229]  A great American, Professor Doug Castle, debated a pig demon.
[01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:21.816]  And I don't normally call names, but folks, somebody who goes, yeah, we can torture small children and crush their testicles in front of their parents is a pig demon.
[01:08:21.836 --> 01:08:23.197]  I mean, there's no better word.
[01:08:23.217 --> 01:08:26.740]  I mean, Joseph Mingala didn't promote this in the open.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.841]  They had some shame.
[01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:32.926]  And I just learned it was Stephen Bybee that actually wrote the memo saying that.
[01:08:33.776 --> 01:09:01.995]  uh... but then it was uh... it was uh... it was john you another one of these uh... uh... those palestinian creatures who said yeah the president there's no treating do that if he wants i mean this is it isn't in the president can barbecue small children on the white house lawn the president can snort cocaine off the backs of uh... uh... topless dancers on in the oval office on national tv no he can't do that and again he is it to a higher standard okay i want to go to our guest on the show
[01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.260]  That's coming up in just a minute.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:22.634]  I didn't plug it last hour, and I tend to not plug my videos as much as I should, but because I had some sniveling creature call up and say I was bad for basically making films and doing things and being involved in the world, let me just plug them now just for him.
[01:09:23.255 --> 01:09:25.397]  My new film is The Order of Death, okay?
[01:09:26.157 --> 01:09:39.750]  And it's a Nazi death cult society, and I snuck into Bohemian Grove, and we've got the skull and bones information, and we've got their own autobiographies where they admit that they engage in these rituals, so you can just go off what these elitists say in their own published books with their names on it.
[01:09:40.411 --> 01:09:47.778]  And we got new footage from an employee inside the Grove, not just from my infiltration back in 2000 that's been on national and international television.
[01:09:48.607 --> 01:09:51.070]  The original Dark Secrets has been upgraded.
[01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:53.693]  And then there's the new Order of Death film.
[01:09:53.733 --> 01:09:56.376]  Two films combo DVD for the price of one.
[01:09:56.396 --> 01:09:59.940]  $24.95 each additional $9.95 if you want to give one as a gift.
[01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:03.024]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:10:03.364 --> 01:10:04.185]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.880]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:15.282]  Then there's my other new film, Martial Law.
[01:10:15.742 --> 01:10:31.089]  In the first hour is the police state, the microwave guns, the blimps, the police threatening to arrest us at the RNC, the police state around the country, and then the reality of 9-11, and then a full hour on the globalist master plan and what these neocons are up to.
[01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:34.851]  That miniseries is $24.95 as well.
[01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:36.192]  It's three films in one.
[01:10:36.252 --> 01:10:38.093]  It's infowars.com.
[01:10:38.786 --> 01:10:41.247]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv and see it all online right now.
[01:10:41.607 --> 01:10:42.687]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[01:10:42.807 --> 01:10:44.668]  I am just really fired up.
[01:10:45.388 --> 01:10:49.490]  Bush Adviser says President has legal power to torture children.
[01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:58.093]  John Yee publicly argued that there is no law that could prevent the President from ordering the torture of a child or a suspect in custody, including by crushing that child's
[01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:04.636]  I hate to tell you, we don't talk like this on the show, but when the President's people are putting these in memos, you've got to talk about it.
[01:11:04.656 --> 01:11:08.457]  It's like Gonzalez, now Attorney General, says they don't need warrants to spy on you.
[01:11:08.777 --> 01:11:09.978]  I mean, that ought to scare everybody.
[01:11:10.698 --> 01:11:12.139]  That's a felony every time they do that.
[01:11:12.579 --> 01:11:21.483]  This came out in response to a question in a debate in Chicago with Notre Dame professor, international human rights scholar, Doug Castle, who's on with us now.
[01:11:22.323 --> 01:11:25.484]  And he brought up some of these White House memos.
[01:11:25.504 --> 01:11:26.945]  I mean, sick things, folks.
[01:11:27.757 --> 01:11:28.018]  Sick!
[01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:32.604]  I mean, I've read the memos on air where, well, we can torture them to death, and if we don't call it torture, it isn't.
[01:11:33.806 --> 01:11:40.315]  And now, torturing children, which is, by the way, came out of the Abu Ghraib General Toghumbu report.
[01:11:41.952 --> 01:11:49.937]  He was charged with it, raping women, beating children in front of people, raping people with large objects dripping with acid.
[01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:54.400]  I mean, again, this is Mingela Jeffrey Dahmer hell-pitched.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.701]  This is Silence of the Lambs.
[01:11:56.021 --> 01:11:58.102]  You know, she rubs the lotion on the skin.
[01:11:58.122 --> 01:11:59.403]  That's enough.
[01:11:59.603 --> 01:12:01.204]  Professor, thank you for joining us today.
[01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:02.585]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:12:03.165 --> 01:12:05.287]  I mean, does this freak you out like it freaks me out?
[01:12:05.307 --> 01:12:08.849]  I mean, it's getting so... I think I'm in an alternate dimension.
[01:12:08.869 --> 01:12:10.130]  I mean, this is getting so crazy.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:37.033]  Well, we're in one of those periods when the executive branch is going off the rails, and the purpose of my questioning Professor Yu, who's now a professor at Berkeley in California in the law school, about the idea of torturing a child, was to really draw out the unstated implications of this Justice Department memo, of which he was, although it was signed by Stephen Bybee, it was actually authored by John Yu.
[01:12:37.771 --> 01:13:04.584]  And in that memo, which was directed in August of 2002 to then-Presidential Legal Counsel Alberto Gonzalez, now the Attorney General, the basic line of argument from the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, which is the official legal advisor to the executive branch, was that whenever the President thinks he needs to do something in order to win a war, he can do it, and no law and no treaty can stop him.
[01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:11.451]  Now when you read that, sort of in the general and the abstract, it sounds like they can't really mean to do anything.
[01:13:12.292 --> 01:13:17.936]  So I thought I would try to see just how far you would take it in the Chicago debate last month.
[01:13:18.716 --> 01:13:26.722]  And as you have reported, he did indicate that if it involved torturing someone, well, the president could authorize that.
[01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:29.244]  I said, well, what if the guy doesn't talk after you torture him?
[01:13:29.264 --> 01:13:32.306]  Can you torture his child in front of him, including by crushing
[01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:35.815]  The testicles, and his answer was legally yes.
[01:13:35.915 --> 01:13:40.764]  Now to be fair to Professor Yu, he says he's against crushing the testicles of children.
[01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:45.727]  He doesn't think it would be a good idea, but legally he claims the President can do it.
[01:13:45.827 --> 01:13:47.487]  Well, that's total double thinking.
[01:13:47.527 --> 01:13:50.689]  I don't like to do this, but we're going to maybe have to.
[01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:52.169]  It's like Tommy Franks.
[01:13:52.369 --> 01:13:58.492]  It's going to be generals hate to run martial law and have a new military dictatorship, but we're going to have to.
[01:13:59.972 --> 01:14:04.814]  Well, it's basically asking us to throw out the rule of law, because it's basically saying
[01:14:05.484 --> 01:14:06.865]  We don't think it's a good idea.
[01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:07.825]  We're nice guys.
[01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.466]  Trust us, we won't do it.
[01:14:09.526 --> 01:14:12.148]  But Saddam didn't even... Don't tell us we can't do it.
[01:14:12.368 --> 01:14:14.869]  Saddam didn't even torture people's children in front of them.
[01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:19.252]  I mean, even in the wildest propaganda, the neocons spewed about him.
[01:14:19.272 --> 01:14:22.153]  That wasn't said, and then they just write memos about it.
[01:14:22.193 --> 01:14:23.394]  I mean, this is sick!
[01:14:24.315 --> 01:14:24.975]  Well, it's sick.
[01:14:25.035 --> 01:14:26.536]  Unfortunately, there are cases.
[01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:31.919]  Years ago, I was legal advisor to the UN Truth Commission in El Salvador, and we had
[01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:42.616]  Evidence there that one of the torture techniques used in El Salvador, and there are also reports of this in Chile, is to torture people's children, or in some cases their wives.
[01:14:42.656 --> 01:14:45.858]  But that isn't Saddam, that's Negroponte's death squads.
[01:14:46.499 --> 01:14:48.460]  That's Negroponte's death squads.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:54.224]  I don't remember whether there was specifically this involving Saddam, but I'm certainly not going to defend Saddam.
[01:14:54.264 --> 01:14:55.425]  He's a bloody guy.
[01:14:55.445 --> 01:14:59.569]  Oh, I understand, but Negroponte's our new head of all intelligence.
[01:14:59.909 --> 01:15:01.090]  I feel much safer now.
[01:15:02.494 --> 01:15:29.863]  Well, Negroponte was the United States Ambassador in Honduras during the early 1980s at a time when Honduran death squads were operating, and the official State Department human rights reports on Honduras at the time did not give any indication that the State Department was aware that the government was backing death squads, let alone that American intelligence agents were involved in some of these interviews where people were tortured
[01:15:30.715 --> 01:15:31.536]  And then killed.
[01:15:31.596 --> 01:15:34.338]  That's not the info I've gotten from our guests and people that were there.
[01:15:34.378 --> 01:15:39.362]  Negroponte supposedly was the prime mover on a lot of that.
[01:15:39.682 --> 01:15:43.966]  And we know that at the School of America, they trained those very Latin American countries.
[01:15:44.366 --> 01:15:49.010]  I've had Special Forces commanders on here who trained to put electrodes on the genitalia.
[01:15:49.591 --> 01:15:50.491]  Well, that's my point.
[01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:52.273]  I'm not saying Negroponte wasn't involved.
[01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:53.614]  I'm saying that he was there
[01:15:54.535 --> 01:15:54.955]  I don't know.
[01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:10.698]  Evidence admissible in a court that would prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
[01:16:10.738 --> 01:16:14.820]  Regardless, we have this memo by John Yoo.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.661]  Let's get into that.
[01:16:15.701 --> 01:16:18.743]  I mean, but imagine just how, I mean, so describe the scene.
[01:16:18.763 --> 01:16:21.384]  You're in there and you're having this discussion, this debate.
[01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:22.745]  I mean, describe it for us, Professor.
[01:16:23.306 --> 01:16:31.871]  Well, this was a debate on the subject of torture as used against terrorism, sponsored by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:16:31.991 --> 01:16:34.112]  It was held on December 1st in Chicago.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:59.012]  It was just Professor Yu and me and a moderator on the stage, and basically the questions went back and forth, and one of the questions, as I indicated earlier, was designed by me to see if Professor Yu would take it so far as to say that the President could torture children, and as we've indicated, that was exactly what he said as a matter of law.
[01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:04.475]  I'm going to play that clip when we get back, but the Council on Foreign Relations, how many of those guys were in attendance?
[01:17:05.975 --> 01:17:11.779]  It was held actually in a club in Chicago, because this is part of their outreach program to younger members.
[01:17:11.879 --> 01:17:16.522]  I would say that in the audience, probably 150-200 people.
[01:17:16.562 --> 01:17:25.087]  Yeah, because I had read that somehow there were thousands of students watching, and I guess there must be a tape of it that was shown then at a college, because I'm getting conflicting reports here.
[01:17:25.127 --> 01:17:28.629]  But okay, so you've got junior CFR members there.
[01:17:28.829 --> 01:17:31.991]  I mean, were they disgusted, or did people stand up and go, Yes!
[01:17:32.392 --> 01:17:33.372]  Kill the children!
[01:17:33.392 --> 01:17:33.893]  Get them!
[01:17:33.953 --> 01:17:34.593]  I mean, what happened?
[01:17:34.873 --> 01:17:42.584]  No, the people who were at the crowd, while they didn't, I don't know that they specifically commented on that, just in general it was clear.
[01:17:43.593 --> 01:18:11.253]  that uh... about ninety percent something like that of of the crowd was uh... was uh... opposed to the line of argument but i don't know if it was a and i'm probably opposed to joseph mingola and jeffrey dahmer and ted bundy too i think that might get up to ninety one percent yeah i mean i i mean listen if i was there's money was saying crushed the uh... we can crush children's genitalia i'd say hey get out of here punk you're assuming i i would stand up and yell at him but this was a this was a very polite crowd there was no
[01:18:12.304 --> 01:18:14.786]  No transcript being taken.
[01:18:14.827 --> 01:18:16.308]  There was no official recording.
[01:18:16.348 --> 01:18:25.357]  The recording that's now on the internet was apparently done by someone in the audience whose method of protest was to make sure that what was said actually got out into the internet.
[01:18:25.977 --> 01:18:29.481]  Oh, that's right, because a lot of these CFR meetings, they sign non-disclosure agreements.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.020]  That's right.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.782]  I didn't know, frankly, that it was a... Sorry, there goes my cell phone.
[01:18:34.802 --> 01:18:35.442]  Let me find it.
[01:18:35.922 --> 01:18:36.782]  It's okay, Professor.
[01:18:36.822 --> 01:18:38.423]  We're going to break and come right back.
[01:18:38.443 --> 01:18:38.563]  Okay.
[01:18:38.683 --> 01:18:40.703]  I know I'm getting boisterous here.
[01:18:40.723 --> 01:18:41.844]  I'm just very upset by this.
[01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:43.144]  I mean, we're all in danger, folks.
[01:18:43.164 --> 01:18:48.526]  When they're openly saying they can torture children in front of their parents, I mean, we've entered the ninth circle of hell.
[01:18:48.606 --> 01:18:51.447]  I mean, we are actually in the presence of Satan right now.
[01:18:53.777 --> 01:18:55.239]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:18:55.579 --> 01:18:59.543]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:18:59.924 --> 01:19:03.448]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:19:03.828 --> 01:19:07.372]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[01:19:07.772 --> 01:19:12.638]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:18.743]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:19:19.063 --> 01:19:22.766]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:25.188]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:19:25.528 --> 01:19:31.313]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:32.914]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:19:33.234 --> 01:19:34.354]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:19:34.434 --> 01:19:39.856]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.

[01:22:48.134 --> 01:23:06.048]  I read several articles about this exchange in Chicago and I didn't even know it was a
[01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:13.780]  A CFR branch meeting and I was just talking to the professor during the break.
[01:23:14.181 --> 01:23:17.687]  Most of the local CFR meetings are open to the public in Chicago.
[01:23:17.948 --> 01:23:19.450]  They just have the secret ones mainly.
[01:23:20.893 --> 01:23:22.435]  They're off 24th Street in New York.
[01:23:23.056 --> 01:23:23.918]  They're at the Proud House.
[01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:31.350]  Well, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, which is a formally independent organization from the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, but they cooperate on a lot of matters,
[01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:59.009]  I've been to many of their programs and in my experience they are generally, not always, but generally open to the public and on the record when you're talking about a large program like this one with about 200 people present.
[01:24:00.109 --> 01:24:09.436]  When I got to this one I was made to realize, maybe they had told me before and I paid no attention, but I was made to realize that this one was
[01:24:10.131 --> 01:24:16.275]  Off the record, in the sense that there was no recording and no transcript being taken of what was being said.
[01:24:17.276 --> 01:24:25.682]  And later on, it turned out that someone who was in the audience apparently recorded the debate and has put at least portions of it on the internet.
[01:24:26.203 --> 01:24:29.105]  Yeah, we've got that up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:30.646]  We'll play that coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:30.986 --> 01:24:37.831]  And we're going to have Kevin Smith, who got video, we put it on TV locally, where they had an official CFR meeting, but it was public as well.
[01:24:38.918 --> 01:24:42.320]  And where they said things just as amazing as what we've caught on tape here.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.702]  But, Professor, getting into the psychology, I mean, you study this.
[01:24:45.722 --> 01:24:50.344]  You've been an advocate for human rights and people's liberties for a long time.
[01:24:50.384 --> 01:24:52.565]  I've done some research on you, and what you've done is admirable.
[01:24:53.546 --> 01:24:54.566]  Did this even shock you?
[01:24:54.586 --> 01:25:00.169]  I mean, I know you've read the memo that they'd penned, but to actually hear him go, yeah, we can do that.
[01:25:00.809 --> 01:25:10.333]  Well, I was shocked when I first read this August 2002 memo, which I first read when it became public for the first time after Abu Ghraib in about June of 2004.
[01:25:11.994 --> 01:25:27.380]  I was shocked then because I never thought, as a human rights lawyer who goes around the world trying to do what we can to prevent and to punish people who commit torture, I never thought that I would have to be debating in my own country.
[01:25:28.204 --> 01:25:49.464]  uh... the idea that it's okay for the president to authorize torture uh... so that the shock for me really came back in two thousand four when it became obvious on reading this memo that uh... torture at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere was not merely a matter of some low-level uh... soldier or prison guard going going haywire but was a matter of high-level
[01:25:50.146 --> 01:25:51.306]  Official policy.
[01:25:51.346 --> 01:26:04.951]  Yeah, the memos went out to the Pentagon and they gave it to the officers and they had the private wings, and we interviewed Janice Karpinski, who wouldn't play ball with them, she wasn't even allowed in those wings of the prisons, and they tried to blame her for something she hadn't done when she didn't go along with it.
[01:26:04.991 --> 01:26:06.371]  They made her the fall girl.
[01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:14.694]  The August 2002 memo, which by the way has now been officially revoked by the Justice Department after it became public and became very embarrassing.
[01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:17.735]  But we got this big lawyer who works for them still defending it.
[01:26:18.499 --> 01:26:28.439]  Well, not only is this lawyer who worked for them, he's now out of government and a professor is still defending it, but when they revoked it, they reissued a new memo in December of 2004.
[01:26:30.493 --> 01:26:40.156]  But that new memo did not withdraw all the claims made in the August 2002 memo, and one of the claims it did not withdraw was the very wanted issue here.
[01:26:40.516 --> 01:26:43.497]  And now Steve Bybee, he is now a federal judge, right?
[01:26:43.557 --> 01:26:58.142]  Steven Bybee, who was then an official in the Justice Department, was since elevated to the federal bench by nomination of... And so they're stacking the executive agencies and the judiciary with these ghouls.
[01:26:59.745 --> 01:27:04.689]  Well, I don't know Mr. Bivey, so I don't know whether I would call him a ghoul.
[01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:09.314]  Well, you said he signed off on used... He signed off on used memo.
[01:27:09.354 --> 01:27:18.844]  To be fair to Mr. Bivey, he was not present at the exchange about crushing children's testicles, and I hope he would recoil at the suggestion that that would be...
[01:27:20.177 --> 01:27:26.580]  Well, we can say Alberto Gonzalez is a ghoul, saying they can torture people to death and then not call it torture.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.501]  I mean, we know he's the Attorney General.
[01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:30.722]  I mean, are they not stacking the courts with their ghouls?
[01:27:31.262 --> 01:27:41.707]  They are stacking the courts and the executive branch agencies, unfortunately, with people like John Yoo and many others of his persuasion.
[01:27:43.283 --> 01:28:04.504]  Who believe that the country is so threatened by terrorists and other menaces to our national security that the necessary response to that, they say, is to throw the rule book out the window and to essentially say to the courts, hands off, the president, the commander-in-chief, he can do whatever he deems
[01:28:05.094 --> 01:28:05.735]  Necessary.
[01:28:05.775 --> 01:28:06.936]  The courts can't interfere.
[01:28:06.956 --> 01:28:12.060]  Well, I've even got a clip of Specter, who they push to get appointed as the head of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate.
[01:28:12.361 --> 01:28:13.942]  Their boy, Mr. Magic Bullet.
[01:28:14.803 --> 01:28:19.727]  We played it a few days ago, going, well, I'm kind of upset, but the president may have this executive power.
[01:28:19.987 --> 01:28:24.351]  Of course he's going to say in his hearing next week or two weeks from now, he's got this power.
[01:28:24.772 --> 01:28:26.073]  I mean, we're just in deep trouble.
[01:28:26.233 --> 01:28:27.714]  I mean, they're throwing down the gauntlet.
[01:28:27.754 --> 01:28:28.535]  Professor, stay with us.
[01:28:28.575 --> 01:28:30.637]  I want to hear more of what you have to say when we get back.
[01:28:30.657 --> 01:28:31.498]  I want to play this clip.
[01:28:31.918 --> 01:28:35.022]  And I got Kevin Smith in here who witnessed, and we have the video of it.
[01:28:35.302 --> 01:28:36.604]  We ought to put that on the radio sometime.
[01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:39.247]  The audio's pretty bad because it was far away.
[01:28:39.487 --> 01:28:41.630]  Where they're sitting there talking about concentration camps.
[01:28:44.213 --> 01:28:45.134]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.614 --> 01:28:47.236]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.256 --> 01:28:50.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.423 --> 01:28:58.869]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:28:59.149 --> 01:29:02.754]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:29:02.874 --> 01:29:10.984]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:29:11.244 --> 01:29:16.907]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:29:17.187 --> 01:29:22.450]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:24.791]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:29:25.051 --> 01:29:37.198]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:41.861]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:29:42.062 --> 01:29:43.022]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:43.202 --> 01:29:44.824]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:29:44.944 --> 01:29:46.745]  That's FilterMag.com.

[01:29:54.443 --> 01:29:56.424]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:56.504 --> 01:30:07.229]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.609 --> 01:30:12.111]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:12.191 --> 01:30:23.516]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:24.116 --> 01:30:30.960]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.481]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.981 --> 01:30:38.944]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:39.244 --> 01:30:46.009]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:31:55.165 --> 01:32:00.327]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.987 --> 01:32:03.309]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:06.306 --> 01:32:09.187]  All right, our final segment with the professor.
[01:32:09.867 --> 01:32:13.648]  Professor, we've only got 10-15 minutes left with you here or less.
[01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:27.191]  Before we let Kevin Smith get in here and talk a little bit about some of the things he's witnessed and play this little two-minute clip that was ferried out of the secret CFR meeting up there that you were there debating this pig demon at
[01:32:28.011 --> 01:32:29.112]  I'm sorry, that's my term.
[01:32:29.192 --> 01:32:29.853]  They deserve it.
[01:32:29.873 --> 01:32:31.774]  I mean, I would call Joseph Mingala a pig demon.
[01:32:32.094 --> 01:32:35.096]  That's just my own little term I like to use that describes these creatures.
[01:32:35.877 --> 01:32:37.478]  That's just kind of what I see them as.
[01:32:38.098 --> 01:32:42.882]  But to be really serious here, any other key points that you think people need to know that you haven't had a chance to make?
[01:32:43.242 --> 01:32:48.446]  Any websites we should visit to see any of your writings or any of the things that you're fighting right now?
[01:32:49.006 --> 01:33:05.796]  Well, one key point is that, as many people may know, with the leadership of Senator John McCain and a number of others, Congress passed a law in late 2005 that said that torture is just completely illegal.
[01:33:06.057 --> 01:33:07.738]  No agent of the U.S.
[01:33:07.778 --> 01:33:11.680]  government can conduct torture anywhere, anytime, for any reason.
[01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:23.133]  When the President signed that bill, which he signed only because it was passed in both houses with an overwhelming veto-proof majority... He declared an imaginary power and said, I don't have to follow this.
[01:33:23.433 --> 01:33:29.255]  He basically said, I am signing this subject to my powers as Commander-in-Chief.
[01:33:29.396 --> 01:33:39.180]  So as recently as late last year, just a month or two ago, the President is continuing to maintain the same legal theory that John Yoo
[01:33:39.989 --> 01:33:43.632]  And Stephen Bybee put into that memo back in August of 2002.
[01:33:44.213 --> 01:34:01.767]  But Professor Castle, I have the Article 2, Section 2, and it clearly says that he's only the Commander-in-Chief when Congress declares war and specifically funds him with a specific job, and that he must abide by the Constitution, but that's the complete opposite.
[01:34:01.807 --> 01:34:04.029]  He claims that it literally makes him God-Emperor.
[01:34:04.847 --> 01:34:11.450]  Well, and that's the theory of Professor Yu that has now become accepted, apparently, by the Bush administration.
[01:34:11.490 --> 01:34:15.252]  And when that theory is taken to its extreme, there is no limit.
[01:34:15.392 --> 01:34:18.593]  And that was exactly the point of that question in Chicago.
[01:34:18.733 --> 01:34:22.655]  According to these guys, there are simply no legal limits on the President.
[01:34:23.175 --> 01:34:24.656]  That is not the rule of law.
[01:34:24.696 --> 01:34:27.397]  That's not what our Constitution was intended to establish.
[01:34:28.138 --> 01:34:40.889]  Well, I mean, listen, martial law, total control, tyrannies, so they can bid-brig and war profiteer and just do it all right out in front of us, and so, you know, that congressman in California won't go to jail in the future for stealing $800 million.
[01:34:40.909 --> 01:34:41.570]  It's no big deal.
[01:34:41.610 --> 01:34:43.892]  I mean, literally, to fake to a fake post office box.
[01:34:45.172 --> 01:34:49.833]  If they're Supreme Rulers, they can do whatever they want, and they're actually openly declaring that power.
[01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:53.854]  I mean, Bush said things would be a heck of a lot easier if this was a dictatorship.
[01:34:54.134 --> 01:34:55.274]  In fact, guys, find that clip.
[01:34:55.294 --> 01:34:55.915]  It's in a computer.
[01:34:56.715 --> 01:35:02.616]  If this was a dictatorship, so long as I'm a dictator, and that's now what they're declaring.
[01:35:02.636 --> 01:35:04.156]  Do you disagree with that statement, Professor?
[01:35:04.636 --> 01:35:07.737]  No, but what they also declare is, trust us.
[01:35:07.857 --> 01:35:08.837]  We're nice guys.
[01:35:08.897 --> 01:35:09.978]  We're reasonable people.
[01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:12.138]  We're just trying to do what's right for the country.
[01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:18.510]  And the problem with their message is they don't come out of the closet as, as you say, pig demons.
[01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:25.655]  They present themselves as reasonable people just presenting a particular constitutional interpretation.
[01:35:25.695 --> 01:35:28.017]  That is a seductive approach.
[01:35:28.698 --> 01:35:35.063]  It's one that is capable, unfortunately, of misleading many Americans into thinking, well, this guy's not so bad.
[01:35:35.623 --> 01:35:41.668]  But the problem is once you remove any constitutional or legal constraint on the president to
[01:35:42.421 --> 01:35:47.766]  Even go so far as to torture children in the opinion of Professor Yu, then the sky's the limit.
[01:35:47.786 --> 01:35:54.532]  There's no law, there's no Congress, there's no court, there's no international treaty to stop them.
[01:35:54.552 --> 01:35:59.397]  They've got to come out public and say it to legitimize it if they're planning to use it.
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.761]  And all the preparations we're seeing, I mean, my friend, I've been to urban warfare drills where U.S.
[01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:07.842]  military is trying to take over America, and they admit it!
[01:36:08.462 --> 01:36:21.305]  So, and they're openly saying, get rid of Posse Comitatus, they've got these TSA Viper teams now right here in Texas just randomly surrounding buildings and just searching everyone, and they say it's just random?
[01:36:21.345 --> 01:36:22.505]  I mean, this is getting scary!
[01:36:23.385 --> 01:36:24.926]  Well, again, my point is,
[01:36:26.114 --> 01:36:40.520]  They have already done some things, but what worries me more than anything else is that once they tear down the rule of law, once they remove any legal or institutional constraint on what they want to do, then we have to worry about how far they can go in the future.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:47.263]  They're already doing it in some cases, but if this theory is allowed to stand, we have no protection.
[01:36:47.623 --> 01:36:49.724]  Go ahead, did you say you had that dictator clip?
[01:36:49.744 --> 01:36:51.245]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:36:52.766 --> 01:36:53.426]  But that's okay.
[01:36:54.602 --> 01:36:56.943]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[01:36:58.484 --> 01:36:59.785]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:37:02.447 --> 01:37:05.608]  And folks, remember, I've been a Republican right out of high school.
[01:37:06.069 --> 01:37:07.109]  I am a conservative.
[01:37:07.169 --> 01:37:07.930]  I'm pro-gun.
[01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.550]  Everything, folks.
[01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:09.731]  I'm telling you, George Bush
[01:37:10.331 --> 01:37:12.392]  is about as conservative as the Tooth Fairy.
[01:37:13.133 --> 01:37:14.854]  I want to bring in Kevin Smith.
[01:37:14.994 --> 01:37:17.695]  Kevin goes to a lot of these meetings, tracks a lot of this.
[01:37:18.136 --> 01:37:22.138]  Kevin, you went to two series, the War on Terror series and the quote, New World Order series.
[01:37:22.698 --> 01:37:29.842]  And just quickly for the professor, because he wasn't there, perhaps you can get in contact with him in sending this other video or whoever's getting this secret tape out.
[01:37:29.882 --> 01:37:31.223]  We're going to play it in a minute.
[01:37:31.563 --> 01:37:36.606]  But I mean, tell him what we've got on tape with the former CIA Director and Professor Lino Graglia.
[01:37:37.468 --> 01:37:39.148]  Professor Castle, it's good to speak with you today.
[01:37:39.168 --> 01:37:39.869]  Thank you.
[01:37:40.469 --> 01:37:41.649]  Let me set this a little bit.
[01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:51.651]  This was the first day of the war back in March of 2003 while the liberal college professors were battling the riot cops down in downtown Austin.
[01:37:51.771 --> 01:37:57.953]  I took it upon myself and a few other people to go to a lecture that night by Anne Marie Slaughter.
[01:37:58.033 --> 01:37:59.373]  She is the Dean of
[01:37:59.913 --> 01:38:14.006]  The Woodrow Wilson School of International Policy study at Princeton in the name of her lecture and I have the handout was a new world order and I got there a little late after they had said you're not allowed to film this we came in and filmed it and we got
[01:38:15.433 --> 01:38:19.134]  Professor Leo Graglia, Philip Bobbitt, a number of people were pretty put out by it.
[01:38:19.254 --> 01:38:22.775]  But there was maybe 250, 300 people at this event.
[01:38:22.855 --> 01:38:32.017]  So they were having a three-day festival, lavishing Philip Bobbitt over his new book, Shield of Achilles, where he had actually predicted events such as 9-11.
[01:38:32.797 --> 01:38:43.259]  And there was a Saturday luncheon lecture, and I thought, I'm going to go to this, I'm going to get there before them, I'm going to be set up, and I'm going to confront them for what they're doing and bring up Brzezinski's book and all those things.
[01:38:43.968 --> 01:38:44.549]  And I got to
[01:39:00.903 --> 01:39:16.088]  And it's scary that the moderate in the room was Woolsey, but there's Professor Leo Graglia, there's Professor Philip Bobbitt, there's Harold Prince, I believe Bobby Inman was there, Ann Marie Slaughter, and these arguments they were having, Graglia was chastising
[01:39:16.608 --> 01:39:17.329]  We're good to go.
[01:39:40.516 --> 01:39:56.510]  And then they start dripping and smacking their lips and, you know, woolsy looking like some little conehead, a Martian, rubbing his little hands together with those big hypnotic eyes going, ah, World War IV is coming, we will win, oh!
[01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:57.631]  Professor, comments on that?
[01:39:58.631 --> 01:40:07.439]  Well, you're always going to have, obviously I wasn't there and don't know who said what, but you're always going to have people in or close to governments.
[01:40:08.072 --> 01:40:15.999]  Who, for reasons that they think are in good faith and well-meaning, are going to propose things like concentration camps and torture.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.581]  You're never going to get rid of that.
[01:40:17.681 --> 01:40:32.775]  What you need, however, are independent courts with clear laws and constitutional principles and international treaties so that some independent check can be imposed on the inevitable excesses of people in and close to the executive branch.
[01:40:33.283 --> 01:40:43.985]  So once again, my answer is, it's good that if they're going to say these things that they can be recorded and brought out to the open, but what we need are courts who can stop them.
[01:40:44.025 --> 01:40:55.607]  And what worries me about the nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court is that there's nothing... He's another one that wrote in memos that the executive is God Emperor.
[01:40:56.267 --> 01:40:58.807]  Well, his memos are a bit ambiguous.
[01:40:59.007 --> 01:41:02.448]  If you look at what he wrote about the so-called unitary executive,
[01:41:03.095 --> 01:41:09.857]  He is there using a phrase which is also used by the John Hughes of the world, but he did not spell out what he meant by it.
[01:41:09.937 --> 01:41:12.718]  Well, I read on air some of the quotes out of memos.
[01:41:12.738 --> 01:41:14.599]  I mean, certainly there's a diverse body.
[01:41:15.139 --> 01:41:21.681]  I mean, he said in front of the Senate last week that he doesn't believe in a Supreme Presidency, but we do have memos that contradict that.
[01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:25.102]  I mean, they're not pushing him forward unless he's for that.
[01:41:25.482 --> 01:41:42.133]  Well, he's been very careful about what he has said, particularly in the confirmation hearings, but my point about Alito is that we are at a time in our history when you have things being said, such as Kevin Smith just referred to, and such as John, you put in that memo from the Justice Department.
[01:41:42.794 --> 01:41:50.179]  We're at a point in our history where we need Supreme Court Justices who know how to stand up and put up a stop sign.
[01:41:51.307 --> 01:42:06.327]  And while I suspect that Alito would go along with what the White House is proposing, what is clear, and beyond any doubt to me, is that we have no evidence that he is the kind of person that we need.
[01:42:07.105 --> 01:42:10.448]  It's not enough to say, well, we haven't caught him with a smoking gun.
[01:42:10.508 --> 01:42:18.295]  We ought to be saying, unless you can show me a Supreme Court Justice who's prepared to stand up to these guys, that version should not be confirmed.
[01:42:18.575 --> 01:42:18.975]  Exactly.
[01:42:19.015 --> 01:42:24.180]  It's almost worse to not know what you're getting than just kind of draw a card out of the deck randomly.
[01:42:24.898 --> 01:42:29.443]  Well, he's not random, but he's sort of a stealth candidate.
[01:42:29.744 --> 01:42:33.868]  No, I know that, but I'm saying, for the American people, all we have is this PR machine.
[01:42:33.888 --> 01:42:38.413]  But listen, let's say Republicans love George Bush and want him to be dictator, and I've heard him say that.
[01:42:38.473 --> 01:42:39.694]  Hey, what's wrong with the dictatorship?
[01:42:39.734 --> 01:42:43.519]  He's a good conservative who's spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:42:44.079 --> 01:42:46.020]  Who's appointing anti-gun judges everywhere.
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.640]  He's very conservative and wants open borders.
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:49.661]  A very conservative professor.
[01:42:50.101 --> 01:42:51.742]  Just wonderfully conservative.
[01:42:52.022 --> 01:42:54.542]  But what about when there's a Hillary Clinton in office?
[01:42:54.582 --> 01:42:57.904]  What about ten years from now when there's somebody else?
[01:42:58.004 --> 01:42:59.784]  I mean, let's say Bush is a little angel.
[01:43:00.224 --> 01:43:02.065]  Still, it's our form of government.
[01:43:02.125 --> 01:43:05.326]  We're America because we have this Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:43:06.007 --> 01:43:12.895]  And that's really what is summed up in the phrase that we need a government of laws and not of men, or nowadays we would say of men and women.
[01:43:13.096 --> 01:43:18.282]  Your point is exactly right that whether you like whoever is in office today or not,
[01:43:19.261 --> 01:43:25.265]  Somebody else may be in office tomorrow, and if there are no limits on what that person can do, sooner or later we will come to regret it.
[01:43:25.505 --> 01:43:31.188]  Well, the Democrats are now saying that this is the administration of corruption, and it's true.
[01:43:31.248 --> 01:43:36.892]  I mean, Bush could come in and say, we're going to be the uncorrupt, the upstanding administration.
[01:43:36.912 --> 01:43:39.333]  You talk about double-think, double-speak.
[01:43:39.393 --> 01:43:41.915]  I mean, it's the complete opposite, just the level.
[01:43:42.335 --> 01:43:45.357]  No one's ever gotten away with this much open stealing.
[01:43:45.377 --> 01:43:48.259]  I mean, the Vice President running the Halliburton contracts?
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.201]  Uh, out of the Vice President's office.
[01:43:51.581 --> 01:43:55.423]  Meanwhile, his wife's on the Lockheed Martin board while he's giving her contracts.
[01:43:55.483 --> 01:43:58.265]  I mean, that is just patently, on its surface, illegal.
[01:43:59.246 --> 01:44:04.729]  Well, it is, of course, illegal, and there are many more things that they're doing that are not illegal.
[01:44:04.769 --> 01:44:14.115]  We've got an election system right now which is built on money, and most of the campaign contributions on which candidates rely are legal.
[01:44:14.195 --> 01:44:17.537]  So, that's obviously another whole subject, but to me, the problem of
[01:44:18.132 --> 01:44:29.140]  American democracy now being beholden to people who have enough money and corporations that have enough money to pay for it is part of the problem that leads us to this place in the first place.
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:33.983]  We're going to let you go here in just a minute or two, but I want to get your take, just any final comments after we play this clip.
[01:44:34.503 --> 01:44:44.350]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip from back in December, and this just came out last week because the audio got loaded onto the web and then got picked up by the news, of John Yoo.
[01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:45.511]  It's one thing to have his memo.
[01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:50.634]  If the President deems that he's got to torture somebody, including by crushing the testicles of the person's child, there is no law that can stop that.
[01:45:11.897 --> 01:45:13.801]  No, and also held law by Congress.
[01:45:13.841 --> 01:45:15.844]  That's what you wrote in the August 2002 memo.
[01:45:15.924 --> 01:45:18.389]  I think it depends on why the President thinks he needs to do that.
[01:45:21.423 --> 01:45:24.004]  So, there is the clip.
[01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:39.050]  Now the same crowd that's been congenital liars keeps saying, nukes, nukes, nukes, when remove the seals, remove the seals, Professor, when the seals are peaceful areas for peaceful nuclear power.
[01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:44.993]  That's admitted by all the engineers and the experts, but the media is acting like we're about to be nuked any minute by Iran.
[01:45:45.053 --> 01:45:50.235]  In closing, give us your take on the whole PNAC, New American Century empire.
[01:45:51.135 --> 01:45:56.117]  Well, I don't think I can do that in a quick closing phrase, but let me clarify that.
[01:45:56.177 --> 01:46:00.019]  Last answer by John Yoo, he said he thinks it depends on what the President's purpose is.
[01:46:00.619 --> 01:46:10.644]  What he meant by that, what was clear from his writings, is that his position, if the President's purpose is to, in effect, prosecute a war, the President can do whatever he wants.
[01:46:11.064 --> 01:46:15.986]  If the President's purpose were just to be vindictive or something like that, of course he could not.
[01:46:16.599 --> 01:46:22.362]  So the answer was a little ambiguous, but essentially it says the President's war powers give him carte blanche.
[01:46:22.862 --> 01:46:33.668]  That is not something that Americans, Republican, Democrat, or otherwise... But that is nowhere in precedent other than Lincoln arresting his political enemies.
[01:46:35.221 --> 01:46:41.788]  But that is light years away from torturing small children in front of their parents.
[01:46:42.128 --> 01:46:45.852]  Well, that's right, and this is one of those areas where you don't need precedent.
[01:46:45.972 --> 01:46:56.143]  If you get someone who says that that kind of thing is lawful, then in my view, that is just so far off the charts of any good constitutional judgment.
[01:46:57.027 --> 01:47:02.651]  That we need, again, to stand up and to make sure we have Supreme Court Justices who will stand up and put a stop to it.
[01:47:02.671 --> 01:47:04.532]  We only have 60 seconds left with our guest.
[01:47:04.592 --> 01:47:06.453]  Kevin, any final comments or questions for him?
[01:47:06.613 --> 01:47:08.574]  Yeah, Professor Castle, one last thing.
[01:47:09.034 --> 01:47:13.437]  During that meeting, Ann Marie Slaughter at one point said, well, this is two days into the war, mind you.
[01:47:13.457 --> 01:47:23.483]  She said, now we can't let the American people know that Iraq will simply be a base of operations for permanent bases to then launch attacks on Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.
[01:47:23.823 --> 01:47:25.925]  And at the end of the program, I got to ask a question.
[01:47:25.945 --> 01:47:26.185]  I said,
[01:47:26.665 --> 01:47:30.347]  You know, how many millions of people are you planning on killing in this World War IV?
[01:47:30.407 --> 01:47:32.928]  And they looked at me like, that's not even a consideration.
[01:47:32.988 --> 01:47:37.029]  So we, the American public, judge these success or not by the number of our dead.
[01:47:37.129 --> 01:47:38.970]  That's not how they factor these things.
[01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.670]  Oh, exactly.
[01:47:39.710 --> 01:47:40.911]  I forgot that point, Professor.
[01:47:41.671 --> 01:47:44.932]  They were openly saying what's in the PNAC document cynically.
[01:47:45.433 --> 01:47:50.755]  They say we can't let them know because they know the average person isn't going to go to their little meeting.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:56.303]  We want your point of view on the whole war situation, in closing.
[01:47:57.524 --> 01:48:10.433]  Well, first of all, the war in Iraq is, in my judgment, a violation of international law, and indeed it fits within the definition of a crime against peace as defined at Nuremberg.
[01:48:11.053 --> 01:48:15.697]  Secondly, the so-called war against terrorism does not qualify as a war
[01:48:16.698 --> 01:48:22.603]  Under international law, it could be referred to as a war in the same sense as the war on drugs or the war on poverty.
[01:48:22.703 --> 01:48:24.145]  It's a nebulous witch hunt.
[01:48:25.366 --> 01:48:26.487]  A rhetorical device.
[01:48:27.007 --> 01:48:43.302]  But the problem with using that language loosely is that the president then decides to say, well, all of the powers that I would have in a legal, recognized war, I can now exercise in this so-called war against terrorism.
[01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:57.991]  And I can treat any individual that I identify anywhere in the world, whether or not he or she is an American citizen, whether or not they're in the United States, I can, on the basis of secret intelligence information, identify that person as a quote,
[01:48:58.404 --> 01:49:04.208]  I think how far they can go depends on how many Americans get informed about what they're trying to do and try to put a stop to it.
[01:49:28.277 --> 01:49:30.459]  But, I mean, where do you see the breaks?
[01:49:30.519 --> 01:49:31.499]  I mean, do you see them failing?
[01:49:31.539 --> 01:49:32.240]  I see them failing.
[01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:38.925]  I see radio shows like yours and programs that raise these issues as the best defense we have.
[01:49:39.125 --> 01:49:41.767]  So you're not even sure we're going to make it?
[01:49:41.947 --> 01:49:44.709]  I'm an optimist by nature, but I want to emphasize that
[01:49:45.231 --> 01:49:48.094]  Success doesn't come easily, it doesn't come automatically.
[01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:49.936]  So we're fighting for our lives.
[01:49:50.096 --> 01:49:50.977]  We're fighting for our lives.
[01:49:51.017 --> 01:49:51.698]  Take care, Professor.
[01:49:52.158 --> 01:49:52.538]  Thank you.
[01:49:54.601 --> 01:50:01.988]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.248 --> 01:50:06.933]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.193 --> 01:50:12.856]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.076 --> 01:50:17.598]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:17.838 --> 01:50:24.981]  The cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.001 --> 01:50:29.343]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.703 --> 01:50:32.205]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:50:32.445 --> 01:50:39.189]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitutional Republic.
[01:50:39.389 --> 01:50:44.652]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:53.792 --> 01:50:57.696]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.916 --> 01:51:03.341]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.621 --> 01:51:13.991]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.151 --> 01:51:18.495]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.675 --> 01:51:27.042]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.322 --> 01:51:33.687]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper, and foul tastes like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.

[01:52:10.465 --> 01:52:11.066]  I think so.
[01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:30.903]  I think so.
[01:52:55.627 --> 01:53:06.135]  We're talking about 9-11, coming up in the next segment.
[01:53:06.575 --> 01:53:07.656]  Take some calls right now.
[01:53:09.397 --> 01:53:09.917]  Uh, listen.
[01:53:11.459 --> 01:53:20.925]  You just heard another top professor, international human rights lawyer, on the air with us saying we may all be going to concentration camps and it may be Nazi Germany.
[01:53:20.965 --> 01:53:23.187]  I mean, see folks, this isn't a joke or a game.
[01:53:23.889 --> 01:53:25.872]  I mean, they're up there declaring that they're dictators.
[01:53:25.893 --> 01:53:28.457]  They got top generals saying, well, it's what's coming next.
[01:53:28.877 --> 01:53:33.244]  They're gearing us all up for it, and if we all go along with it, then stuff gets bad.
[01:53:33.264 --> 01:53:37.712]  See, they want the police state to take your pension funds to rape you financially.
[01:53:39.094 --> 01:53:42.415]  They have to have it in place to really get control.
[01:53:42.955 --> 01:53:46.516]  It's not enough to loot trillions out of the Pentagon trust funds and to do all this.
[01:53:46.576 --> 01:53:47.476]  Now they want even more.
[01:53:47.536 --> 01:53:49.257]  I mean, that's why they're pig demons.
[01:53:49.277 --> 01:53:57.059]  They're big, evil, fat, slobbering creatures that just want it all and they want it now and they're going to get it.
[01:53:58.359 --> 01:53:59.780]  And Bush is a puppet.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.921]  They're front men for this financial interest and this is for all the marbles.
[01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:06.170]  We are fighting for our lives.
[01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:07.091]  Do you understand?
[01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:08.111]  This is not a joke.
[01:54:08.491 --> 01:54:09.511]  This is not a game.
[01:54:09.551 --> 01:54:10.672]  This is not a drill.
[01:54:11.532 --> 01:54:13.252]  We have got to move forward.
[01:54:15.873 --> 01:54:18.014]  What hard is a term people are using on the internet?
[01:54:18.534 --> 01:54:19.254]  Our listeners are.
[01:54:19.414 --> 01:54:20.834]  Information drive-by.
[01:54:21.375 --> 01:54:22.235]  Go to the chat rooms.
[01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:23.115]  Go to the message boards.
[01:54:23.155 --> 01:54:24.115]  Call the talk shows.
[01:54:24.155 --> 01:54:25.016]  Put up websites.
[01:54:25.556 --> 01:54:27.116]  You know, just spray the info.
[01:54:27.236 --> 01:54:28.036]  Fire and forget.
[01:54:28.056 --> 01:54:28.997]  I mean, we're telling the truth.
[01:54:29.017 --> 01:54:29.817]  We got the facts.
[01:54:30.689 --> 01:54:32.830]  And believe me, our view is becoming the majority view.
[01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:34.590]  We are waking people up.
[01:54:35.290 --> 01:54:39.752]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paula in Florida, then James, Thomas, Alex, and others.
[01:54:39.772 --> 01:54:40.632]  Go ahead, Paula.
[01:54:40.652 --> 01:54:41.672]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:42.233 --> 01:54:44.373]  I'll tell you what, hon, you're awesome.
[01:54:44.573 --> 01:54:45.634]  You're right about this.
[01:54:45.714 --> 01:54:46.954]  These people are so sick.
[01:54:47.154 --> 01:54:52.276]  I read the book that Tex Mars wrote, and I'll tell you what, it just totally depressed me.
[01:54:52.376 --> 01:54:54.637]  I mean, I was so angry and so down.
[01:54:54.677 --> 01:54:55.897]  You're talking about Codex Magickum?
[01:54:56.137 --> 01:54:56.417]  Yeah.
[01:54:56.557 --> 01:54:57.357]  Now, we carry that.
[01:54:57.377 --> 01:54:59.018]  Yeah, in the circle of intrigue.
[01:54:59.505 --> 01:54:59.745]  Yes.
[01:54:59.805 --> 01:55:01.746]  And it had the list of everybody that belongs to this.
[01:55:01.766 --> 01:55:02.707]  Yes.
[01:55:02.727 --> 01:55:09.770]  And they said in there that because of who they are, they're from the House of David, they think they have the right to control everybody and everything.
[01:55:10.551 --> 01:55:12.392]  And I tell you what, they're about as sick as they can get.
[01:55:12.652 --> 01:55:14.453]  They are, and they're usurpers.
[01:55:14.473 --> 01:55:15.834]  They're false parasites.
[01:55:15.914 --> 01:55:18.595]  I appreciate your call.
[01:55:18.615 --> 01:55:21.136]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Maryland.
[01:55:21.176 --> 01:55:21.837]  James, go ahead.
[01:55:21.857 --> 01:55:22.257]  You're on the air.
[01:55:23.047 --> 01:55:23.947]  Hello, it's Jason.
[01:55:24.308 --> 01:55:26.429]  Okay, Jason, go ahead.
[01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:38.434]  First, I got something I want to say, but I want to address first the people that keep calling in and giving you a ration of stuff about some fabricated story.
[01:55:38.675 --> 01:55:40.896]  Do you people understand that your house is burning down?
[01:55:42.156 --> 01:55:43.537]  Why are you attacking a Patriot?
[01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:52.872]  I know, I mean, we've got all these government people on admitting that they're building camps and the country's going down and somebody's going, Alex, you're bad because you sell videos.
[01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:54.312]  Well, what am I supposed to do?
[01:55:54.372 --> 01:55:57.173]  Do a radio show with a tin can out on the side of the street?
[01:55:57.553 --> 01:56:06.815]  Well, the thing is, if these people would take the time to check the facts that you put on the air and document what you say and find that it's true, it really doesn't matter.
[01:56:09.436 --> 01:56:12.039]  Look, this is a psychological thing, Jason.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:30.298]  A lot of people, the government puts out its disinfo, their COINTELPRO ops put it out, on anybody who's successfully fighting them, and then the little minions, they know a psychological type out there is going to pick up on it, who's so upset by the information, they don't want to face it, so they attack the messenger.
[01:56:31.749 --> 01:56:33.149]  And so that's all it is.
[01:56:33.249 --> 01:56:37.612]  It doesn't bother me, except that it just, it's just you can always hear it in their voice.
[01:56:37.652 --> 01:56:38.753]  You know what they're going to say.
[01:56:38.793 --> 01:56:40.534]  You know what they're going to do.
[01:56:40.554 --> 01:56:44.296]  And you know they're just going to run down a line of disinfo.
[01:56:44.496 --> 01:56:52.681]  Well, it does bother me because you have to take a half an hour or an hour a week and answer some foolishness just so that you can retain the listeners that you've got.
[01:56:52.781 --> 01:56:56.083]  Oh, so you've heard how I have to answer the same question and they don't want an answer.
[01:56:56.733 --> 01:56:59.775]  They don't want an easily verifiable answer.
[01:57:00.476 --> 01:57:02.437]  They don't know how to judge a tree by its fruit, either.
[01:57:03.078 --> 01:57:08.502]  Actually, the reason that I called in that's a side issue, but it's important enough to... Go ahead and throw out your comment.
[01:57:08.522 --> 01:57:08.802]  Go ahead.
[01:57:08.902 --> 01:57:20.611]  It's actually, with PsyOps, exactly what we're speaking about, but I wanted to know your opinion about the subliminal part of that and how prevalent you think that is.
[01:57:21.494 --> 01:57:22.435]  Subliminal what?
[01:57:22.575 --> 01:57:23.436]  In diopts?
[01:57:23.996 --> 01:57:25.918]  Yes, in media specifically.
[01:57:25.998 --> 01:57:26.539]  Sure, sure.
[01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:27.600]  I'll comment on that when we get back.
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.120]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.241]  More calls coming up.
[01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:30.842]  We'll get Dylan Avery on at the 8 after.
[01:57:30.882 --> 01:57:32.504]  Go ahead and get him on the horn.
[01:57:33.865 --> 01:57:37.768]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.889]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.695 --> 01:57:50.335]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.995 --> 01:57:52.056]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.776 --> 01:57:53.876]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.537 --> 01:57:55.337]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.097 --> 01:57:57.078]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.678 --> 01:58:01.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:05.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.161 --> 01:58:09.563]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in...
[01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:33.391]  to our number three on this live Thursday edition the 19th day of January 2006 and for the next hour we're going to be joined by somebody who didn't sit there and suck their thumb and whine and roll around in a fetal position like you know somebody who actually got involved engage the new world order at point-blank range
[01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:35.671]  We're good to go.
[01:58:54.847 --> 01:58:59.990]  We'll go to Thomas and Alex and Mike and others that have been patiently holding toll-free number to join us 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:06.354]  But this is a little bit different of a 9-11 film from some of the others I've seen, different from mine.
[01:59:07.643 --> 01:59:08.203]  It's excellent.
[01:59:08.263 --> 01:59:09.464]  It's a different perspective.
[01:59:09.784 --> 01:59:12.344]  Just asking the key questions, question after question.
[01:59:12.364 --> 01:59:13.085]  Well, what about this?
[01:59:13.125 --> 01:59:13.685]  What about that?
[01:59:14.165 --> 01:59:18.366]  And then it answers the question for you if you've got a brain.
[01:59:19.046 --> 01:59:21.527]  And so I think it's very effective and folks should get it.
[01:59:21.567 --> 01:59:22.367]  We're very, very honored.
[01:59:22.407 --> 01:59:23.748]  You know, Dylan is very gracious too.
[01:59:23.768 --> 01:59:28.569]  He let us post Loose Change 1 at PrisonPlanet.tv and we put a link over to him where you can get it.
[01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:34.210]  But now we're now carrying Loose Change 2 and hopefully he'll let us put that up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:34.651 --> 01:59:35.971]  Dylan, thank you for joining us.
[01:59:36.764 --> 01:59:37.984]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:59:38.044 --> 01:59:38.665]  It's good to be on.
[01:59:39.065 --> 01:59:39.405]  You bet.
[01:59:39.445 --> 01:59:41.666]  You know, you're just another success story.
[01:59:41.726 --> 01:59:49.688]  I had David Stahl on, who's a city manager, a retired police officer, but a city councilman, and he discovered the toll road tracking grid.
[01:59:49.708 --> 01:59:55.830]  He went public, and now it looks like we may be able to beat it, at least with the majority of counties are joining us to say no to it.
[01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:59.931]  And you and a couple college students got together, did the research.
[01:59:59.971 --> 02:00:04.153]  You went off other, you know, documented research, did your own, and have done something very effective.
[02:00:04.193 --> 02:00:05.093]  You're affecting change.
[02:00:06.204 --> 02:00:07.025]  Well, I'm doing my best.
[02:00:08.145 --> 02:00:15.830]  Tell us about yourself before we get into the film and 9-11 and what you think is most important about it and take some calls on a host of issues, but tell us about your awakening.
[02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:16.650]  What woke you up?
[02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:17.751]  Why did you decide to do this?
[02:00:17.791 --> 02:00:18.371]  What was it like?
[02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:21.953]  Well, it was about three years ago in May 2002.
[02:00:22.534 --> 02:00:28.457]  I was building a restaurant that was basically funded by James Gandolfini, who plays Tony Soprano on the HBO series Sopranos.
[02:00:29.078 --> 02:00:31.479]  And in May 2002, he came up for the opening party.
[02:00:31.959 --> 02:00:34.081]  I had a chance to speak with him after the party and I
[02:00:35.382 --> 02:00:45.265]  I was thinking about getting into the whole film industry, acting, directing, figuring out what I wanted to do, and I approached him at like three in the morning, and I was like, Jim, I just had a quick question.
[02:00:45.285 --> 02:00:46.565]  Is this whole acting thing worth it?
[02:00:47.246 --> 02:00:48.586]  And is it worth it?
[02:00:48.646 --> 02:00:50.467]  And he was like, well, not really, kid.
[02:00:50.867 --> 02:00:53.147]  So I was like, okay, well, how about directing?
[02:00:53.187 --> 02:00:58.469]  He's like, well, if you want to be a successful director, then you have to have something that you want to say to the world.
[02:00:59.153 --> 02:01:03.175]  So, it was not... I mean, that night I started... That's good advice!
[02:01:03.215 --> 02:01:04.236]  You just gotta do it!
[02:01:04.336 --> 02:01:05.757]  It doesn't even have to be perfect.
[02:01:05.797 --> 02:01:08.178]  What, you've done a great job, though, in the first thing you did.
[02:01:08.218 --> 02:01:14.881]  But, I mean, instead of just talking, and all these trendies prance around, have lots of film meetings, and that's not how you do it.
[02:01:14.901 --> 02:01:15.522]  You just do it!
[02:01:16.282 --> 02:01:20.004]  Yeah, well, like I said, man, I'm just a kid doing what I feel in my heart I need to do.
[02:01:20.965 --> 02:01:22.826]  Well, you're not a kid at 23, right?
[02:01:23.126 --> 02:01:25.147]  I mean, we had a lot of founding fathers that were that age.
[02:01:27.183 --> 02:01:28.504]  That's right, they were young, I forgot.
[02:01:28.524 --> 02:01:29.324]  No, you're not a kid.
[02:01:30.204 --> 02:01:34.446]  They tell us that we're kids until we're 30 now, so we never realize we're men when we're 13, 14.
[02:01:34.986 --> 02:01:38.627]  Well, I'm still growing, so I can't say I'm a man yet, but I'm on my way.
[02:01:39.848 --> 02:01:40.628]  I say you're a man.
[02:01:40.668 --> 02:01:43.789]  A man who has beliefs, a man who gets involved, a man who takes action.
[02:01:43.869 --> 02:01:47.670]  I just, I don't, and you're doing a great job there, Dylan.
[02:01:48.311 --> 02:01:48.971]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:01:49.051 --> 02:01:49.771]  I really appreciate it.
[02:01:49.791 --> 02:01:50.131]  You bet.
[02:01:50.571 --> 02:01:55.213]  So he told you, this is riveting, he told you just have something you believe in and get involved.
[02:01:55.842 --> 02:01:57.763]  Yeah, just have something to say and stand behind it.
[02:01:57.863 --> 02:02:15.427]  So, I took a couple different ideas that I've been toying with in the past and characters and kind of threw them all together and started writing a feature film script, which eventually turned into Loose Change the Movie, which was a semi-fictional story about me and my friends finding out that September 11th was basically an inside job.
[02:02:16.148 --> 02:02:17.328]  And... commercial break?
[02:02:18.728 --> 02:02:20.069]  That is a commercial break.
[02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:22.429]  When we get back, we'll hear more about this.
[02:02:22.449 --> 02:02:25.050]  Tell you, that's a seminal event.
[02:02:26.596 --> 02:02:28.218]  It was never even conscious of myself.
[02:02:28.238 --> 02:02:33.665]  I mean, I just was sick of all the lies and what was happening to our country 12 years ago.
[02:02:33.685 --> 02:02:34.646]  And so I just said, you know what?
[02:02:34.706 --> 02:02:35.547]  I'm going to get involved.
[02:02:36.469 --> 02:02:37.350]  And here we are today.
[02:02:38.271 --> 02:02:42.456]  Meanwhile, so many people never even live because they never get in the arena.
[02:02:46.693 --> 02:02:49.555]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.815 --> 02:02:51.377]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.737 --> 02:02:56.400]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.741 --> 02:03:03.486]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.806 --> 02:03:05.787]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.987 --> 02:03:08.807]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.927 --> 02:03:13.589]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.789 --> 02:03:18.190]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:25.652]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.912 --> 02:03:28.312]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:04:45.710 --> 02:04:49.011]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:04:49.331 --> 02:04:54.633]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:04:54.874 --> 02:04:56.754]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[02:05:45.722 --> 02:05:51.286]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.002 --> 02:05:58.845]  Some film students, college students, got together, put it together.
[02:05:58.905 --> 02:05:59.565]  It's excellent.
[02:05:59.886 --> 02:06:01.927]  We're carrying it at Infowars.com.
[02:06:02.368 --> 02:06:11.076]  September 11th was not a surprise attack on America, but rather a cold and calculated genocide by our own government?
[02:06:11.636 --> 02:06:12.057]  What if?
[02:06:12.737 --> 02:06:18.502]  We were told that the Twin Towers were hit by commercial airliners and subsequently brought down by jet fuel.
[02:06:18.943 --> 02:06:21.605]  We were told that the Pentagon was hit by a Boeing 777.
[02:06:22.845 --> 02:06:26.328]  We were told that the Flight 93 crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:34.296]  We were told that 19 Arabs from halfway across the globe, acting under the orders from Osama Bin Laden, were responsible.
[02:06:35.437 --> 02:06:43.445]  What you will see inside will prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that everything you know about 9-11 is a complete fabrication.
[02:06:44.105 --> 02:06:45.126]  Conspiracy theory?
[02:06:45.186 --> 02:06:46.848]  It's not a theory if you can prove it.
[02:06:47.857 --> 02:07:08.564]  And that's a louder than words production loose change second edition written and directed by Dylan Avery produced by Corey Rowe and of course There's a lot of other great folks involved in this and we carry it again at Infowars.com right now you get yourself a hard copy of it Dylan you were talking about how back in 2002
[02:07:10.683 --> 02:07:23.894]  You are working at a local restaurant, building a local restaurant for the star of The Sopranos there in your town, and then you go talk to the head guy and you say, like, three in the morning, hey, what do I do to get involved and break into acting?
[02:07:23.934 --> 02:07:26.276]  I'm just recapping for those who didn't hear it in the last segment.
[02:07:26.937 --> 02:07:28.398]  And he goes, yeah, it's not worth it.
[02:07:28.418 --> 02:07:29.319]  You go, what about directing?
[02:07:29.359 --> 02:07:31.501]  He says, have something you believe in, stand behind it.
[02:07:32.279 --> 02:07:50.113]  And then you were already, I guess, kind of waking up to 9-11, and first it was going to be fiction, or quasi, kind of docudrama, then you decided to make a doc, because obviously that's easier, you know, not setting your sights too high for your first project, and you did a great job on Loose Change 1, now Loose Change 2, but I want to get also into 9-11.
[02:07:50.153 --> 02:07:52.175]  I mean, when did you start to wake up to 9-11?
[02:07:54.770 --> 02:08:02.174]  Well, I guess I subconsciously knew that something was wrong with the official story because in the first maybe 10, 20 pages I started touching upon it.
[02:08:02.814 --> 02:08:09.478]  And when I started really researching 9-11, I came across, I believe it was two, two key websites.
[02:08:09.538 --> 02:08:17.162]  It was Serendipity's World Trade Center and the so-called War on Terror, I believe, and the Blake Puppy Archive.
[02:08:17.202 --> 02:08:21.425]  And a lot of people were posting videos of the collapses and just pointing things out.
[02:08:21.465 --> 02:08:23.646]  And it was at that point that I really started to realize that
[02:08:24.136 --> 02:08:29.941]  Maybe what I was writing wasn't so much fiction as it was reality.
[02:08:30.682 --> 02:08:33.384]  And you basically hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[02:08:33.464 --> 02:08:42.112]  I had too much information to put into an actual feature-length film, so I split it off and basically made Loose Change the documentary.
[02:08:42.612 --> 02:08:45.034]  And people ask me all the time, where'd you get the title, Loose Change?
[02:08:45.054 --> 02:08:45.915]  You know, why Loose Change?
[02:08:45.955 --> 02:08:47.136]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:08:47.156 --> 02:08:51.800]  It's like, well, the reason the documentary is called that is because of the movie that it all started from.
[02:08:52.447 --> 02:08:55.669]  And if all goes according to plan, we'll be shooting Loose Change the movie this year.
[02:08:57.250 --> 02:09:10.219]  Well, I think, you know, the term loose change, it just makes you think of unanswered questions or loose things, you know, parts of things that are just wrong or parts of things that are jingling around in your pocket.
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:12.280]  Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:14.282]  People hear loose change and they automatically think of money.
[02:09:15.503 --> 02:09:20.506]  Well, I think that's obviously what we're... So loose change in the film is going to mean something different?
[02:09:22.416 --> 02:09:23.677]  No, it's the same meaning.
[02:09:23.737 --> 02:09:25.418]  It means lose change.
[02:09:25.538 --> 02:09:28.100]  This is what has to happen and we're doing our part.
[02:09:29.581 --> 02:09:31.883]  So really it's a way of saying unanswered questions.
[02:09:31.923 --> 02:09:34.185]  Things that are still running wild out there.
[02:09:34.205 --> 02:09:37.247]  Yeah, things that have to be done if we want to change this country.
[02:09:38.688 --> 02:09:39.829]  Well that's certainly true.
[02:09:39.909 --> 02:09:44.433]  Now this second edition, why don't you tell folks what it goes through and describe it for them.
[02:09:47.805 --> 02:09:58.747]  The main chapters of the film are, as you described earlier, the opening timeline of the movie, which replaced the whole pod-slash-missile thing from Loose Change 1.
[02:09:58.867 --> 02:10:01.927]  Loose Change 2nd edition opens up with an opening timeline.
[02:10:01.947 --> 02:10:06.448]  The majority of the research I used was from Killtown's website.
[02:10:06.468 --> 02:10:08.088]  I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with Killtown.
[02:10:08.108 --> 02:10:10.669]  He's an amazing, amazing 9-11 researcher.
[02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:12.769]  If you haven't seen his site, you should definitely check it out.
[02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:16.950]  And basically,
[02:10:18.412 --> 02:10:19.753]  I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought there.
[02:10:20.954 --> 02:10:22.635]  I understand that you're also on cell phone.
[02:10:22.675 --> 02:10:28.520]  This is kind of a short notice interview, so you're kind of out on the job while doing this interview.
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:39.469]  We're going to take some calls coming up in a few minutes, but tell me about the team that made these two documentaries, because they're both excellent, but Loose Change 2, obviously, I think is a lot better.
[02:10:40.831 --> 02:10:44.794]  I mean, how long it took you to do it, how you did your research, what you decided to cover?
[02:10:46.199 --> 02:10:49.661]  Uh, I tried to stick to the main key points that I could prove, basically.
[02:10:50.001 --> 02:10:53.122]  Because, I mean, there's a lot of... There's so much about 9-11.
[02:10:53.142 --> 02:10:56.684]  You cannot put everything about 9-11 into a single documentary.
[02:10:56.704 --> 02:10:59.945]  You're not going to make a 9-11 documentary that makes everybody happy.
[02:11:00.185 --> 02:11:04.627]  Because everybody believes that, you know, this piece is important and this piece... Exactly!
[02:11:04.667 --> 02:11:10.110]  I've made three films about it, written a book, published a book, done hundreds of radio shows and thousands of interviews about it.
[02:11:10.848 --> 02:11:11.368]  Exactly.
[02:11:11.868 --> 02:11:12.748]  Why didn't you put in this?
[02:11:12.808 --> 02:11:14.789]  And why didn't you put in John O'Neill?
[02:11:14.869 --> 02:11:16.749]  I can't include everything.
[02:11:17.429 --> 02:11:30.071]  But again, there's those people who've never gotten off the bench, don't even understand what video editing software is, and they just go, why didn't you make it like this?
[02:11:30.091 --> 02:11:32.472]  So I would just ignore that type of stuff.
[02:11:33.292 --> 02:11:34.312]  I mean, that's routine.
[02:11:34.432 --> 02:11:39.053]  Armchair quarterbacks who've never been on the field going, why didn't he make that pass?
[02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:41.800]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:47.142]  I mean, like I said, I tried to stick to the things that were the most solid pieces of evidence.
[02:11:47.182 --> 02:11:58.948]  And what I did for the second edition, as I tried to take the first one, I mean, I basically, right after releasing the first one, I knew that it was incomplete, and I knew that there were automatically things that people were not going to like, and things that I had to fix.
[02:11:59.709 --> 02:12:09.774]  And slowly, offers began pouring in for people that wanted to help, people that wanted to, like I said, the first contribution I got, which was key, which was Ryan Donan, who did the
[02:12:10.336 --> 02:12:13.779]  Animation of Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon, which was phenomenal.
[02:12:13.819 --> 02:12:15.140]  I mean, he did an outstanding job.
[02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:20.244]  This man's got a full-time job and a family, and still managed to bang that out for me.
[02:12:20.284 --> 02:12:21.885]  And again, he did an outstanding job.
[02:12:22.406 --> 02:12:27.710]  So, um, it started with that, and then I started taking some points from the first loose change, like the hijackers.
[02:12:27.810 --> 02:12:31.473]  People emailed me constantly asking, well, where did you get that information on the hijackers?
[02:12:31.913 --> 02:12:33.975]  So I went a lot more in-depth into that.
[02:12:34.035 --> 02:12:36.617]  I had key quotes from each hijacker, each article.
[02:12:37.213 --> 02:12:39.434]  Links to the webpages where you can find them.
[02:12:39.534 --> 02:12:40.395]  I mean, I went all out.
[02:12:40.435 --> 02:12:44.777]  And to be specific, it was kind of like what Hollywood does, but on a local level.
[02:12:44.817 --> 02:12:48.119]  They'll take a film and have focus groups look at it and have different screenings.
[02:12:48.479 --> 02:12:54.103]  So you made edition one, got everybody's feedback, and then used all of that critiquing, which is great.
[02:12:54.123 --> 02:13:00.926]  You know, we all do that to each other, to actually augment and increase the quality and information and viewability of the second one.
[02:13:01.747 --> 02:13:04.168]  Yep, basically.
[02:13:04.188 --> 02:13:04.929]  We tried to take
[02:13:06.067 --> 02:13:10.990]  The best suggestions that we got, and we also tried to include things that I originally wanted to include.
[02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:14.912]  The first, I just didn't have the time and the resources, like Operation Northwoods.
[02:13:14.992 --> 02:13:17.193]  I mean, that originally opened up the documentary.
[02:13:17.253 --> 02:13:23.857]  I had this whole timeline, but it started going off course, and I started including things that weren't exactly relevant.
[02:13:23.937 --> 02:13:26.939]  So I figured I would just put that aside and come back to it at a later date.
[02:13:27.539 --> 02:13:29.080]  And that's what I did for the second mission.
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:33.862]  I start with Northwoods, and then I go to the controlled impact demonstration that NASA did in 1984.
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:37.063]  Uh, all the warnings that the government got.
[02:13:37.204 --> 02:13:44.460]  Basically, it's a much better lead-in to, uh, virgins to 9-11 who have no idea what they're about to get themselves into.
[02:13:45.249 --> 02:13:49.831]  Yeah, they've been beta testing and oiling this and preparing it for many years.
[02:13:49.871 --> 02:13:53.912]  When you really start looking at it, it is totally obvious who did this.
[02:13:53.932 --> 02:13:55.533]  Oh yeah, it's massive.
[02:13:55.773 --> 02:13:56.513]  It is massive.
[02:13:56.553 --> 02:13:59.974]  You know, people always say, hey, something this big, they'd get caught.
[02:14:00.614 --> 02:14:01.475]  People would speak out.
[02:14:01.515 --> 02:14:02.495]  They have spoken out.
[02:14:02.535 --> 02:14:06.116]  I mean, it is what I call an orgy of evidence.
[02:14:06.236 --> 02:14:07.697]  It is ridiculous.
[02:14:08.357 --> 02:14:15.301]  Well, number one, the official story is totally impossible, a complete joke, an absolute 110% fraud.
[02:14:15.441 --> 02:14:20.244]  Every part of it is demonstrably a lie and manufactured and deceptive.
[02:14:20.264 --> 02:14:21.064]  That's number one.
[02:14:21.624 --> 02:14:26.367]  And of course they had prior knowledge and all of that they tried to deny is now public knowledge and admit it.
[02:14:28.043 --> 02:14:29.665]  Then you look at who the hijackers are.
[02:14:29.705 --> 02:14:30.986]  They're clearly government agents.
[02:14:31.046 --> 02:14:32.468]  They're clearly being trained at U.S.
[02:14:32.488 --> 02:14:33.249]  military bases.
[02:14:33.509 --> 02:14:34.890]  They're clearly being protected.
[02:14:35.211 --> 02:14:37.493]  Then you look at NORAD standing down.
[02:14:37.573 --> 02:14:40.276]  You look at the public officials being warned not to fly.
[02:14:40.296 --> 02:14:41.718]  You look at the insider trading.
[02:14:41.958 --> 02:14:43.439]  You look at the bombs in the buildings.
[02:14:43.459 --> 02:14:44.380]  You look at all of it.
[02:14:45.301 --> 02:14:46.743]  It's pretty conclusive, Dylan.
[02:14:47.708 --> 02:14:48.668]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:50.669]  And I got one of those the other day.
[02:14:50.689 --> 02:15:00.592]  People were like, well, you know, when you get to conspiracy theories like this, it's like there's, especially with something like 9-11, is there's so many people that were involved that how could, how have they not come out?
[02:15:01.513 --> 02:15:03.293]  I mean, there's a number of reasons why they wouldn't have.
[02:15:03.353 --> 02:15:07.715]  I mean, if you work for a government that killed 3,000 people, I mean, you probably fear for your own life as well.
[02:15:08.614 --> 02:15:10.415]  Well, look, a lot of them have gone public.
[02:15:10.715 --> 02:15:15.538]  I mean, again, the defense school dean said, I trained some of the hijackers.
[02:15:15.878 --> 02:15:16.999]  They were here at my school.
[02:15:17.019 --> 02:15:17.839]  They're government ops.
[02:15:17.859 --> 02:15:18.760]  The government did it.
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.120]  It was in the San Jose Mercury News.
[02:15:20.361 --> 02:15:21.801]  They told him to shut up and threatened him.
[02:15:22.442 --> 02:15:23.982]  I mean, a bunch of people went public.
[02:15:24.003 --> 02:15:25.203]  How many FBI agents?
[02:15:25.243 --> 02:15:25.603]  How many?
[02:15:26.144 --> 02:15:32.347]  John O'Neill said, and he died on 9-11, he told British TV, he said they're going to stage an attack.
[02:15:33.267 --> 02:15:37.150]  He said they're going to let an attack take place as a way to invade Afghanistan.
[02:15:37.190 --> 02:15:37.790]  And what happened?
[02:15:38.813 --> 02:15:39.554]  Exactly that.
[02:15:41.535 --> 02:15:43.016]  It's amazing.
[02:15:45.538 --> 02:15:50.121]  We're about to break, but in the minute and a half we've got, what are some of the other things you want to talk about when we get back?
[02:15:52.202 --> 02:15:53.683]  I'm really up for anything right now, Alex.
[02:15:53.743 --> 02:15:54.804]  I have to apologize today.
[02:15:54.864 --> 02:16:00.047]  I am under an enormous amount of stress, so this interview is probably not under the best of circumstances.
[02:16:01.377 --> 02:16:07.805]  A lot of things that I'm waiting to do and a lot of things are going wrong for us consecutively, so I'd like to apologize.
[02:16:07.845 --> 02:16:09.487]  I'm not in my best of moods.
[02:16:10.167 --> 02:16:13.071]  Yeah, I've heard on other shows you do sound a bit frazzled on this one.
[02:16:13.671 --> 02:16:14.492]  Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
[02:16:14.532 --> 02:16:15.614]  I'm under a lot of stress lately.
[02:16:15.634 --> 02:16:17.916]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:16:17.976 --> 02:16:18.437]  Well, you know what?
[02:16:18.457 --> 02:16:19.979]  You just got to relax and enjoy it.
[02:16:20.627 --> 02:16:23.291]  Yeah, I'm doing my best man.
[02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:24.192]  Believe me, I'm trying.
[02:16:24.212 --> 02:16:25.013]  I'm 22 actually.
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.661]  About 18, actually.
[02:16:38.681 --> 02:16:38.661]  18?
[02:16:38.902 --> 02:16:41.965]  Because I just turned 22 this past November.
[02:16:42.305 --> 02:16:44.828]  Yeah, well, there are people out there who say, well, some kids made this.
[02:16:44.848 --> 02:16:45.949]  I don't want to hear from them.
[02:16:45.969 --> 02:16:49.032]  You know, the old Bible verse, out of the mouths of babes.
[02:16:49.293 --> 02:16:58.663]  But more than that, you just went out and looked at all the research by all these incredible physicists and underwriters and all the experts, and you guys did a great job of compiling it.
[02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:02.946]  Yeah, and that's the other thing, is that people accuse us of, like, stealing other people's research.
[02:17:02.966 --> 02:17:04.286]  It's like, we're not stealing it.
[02:17:04.686 --> 02:17:08.228]  We're not, we're not, I mean, I'm not claiming to do anything extraordinary.
[02:17:08.308 --> 02:17:09.509]  You even give people credit!
[02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:16.252]  That's what's nuts about some of these quote researchers, is that, is that, oh, you link to me, or you, you know, you use my stuff, how dare you?
[02:17:16.272 --> 02:17:19.973]  Well, we're trying to stop a bunch of killers from doing more, folks!
[02:17:21.824 --> 02:17:23.986]  But you know, you just got to ignore those egomaniacs.
[02:17:24.006 --> 02:17:29.491]  There's not many of them out there, but a lot of them are trying to just control the movement and everything and try to limit its scope.
[02:17:29.531 --> 02:17:33.475]  I think it's great to have a wide debate, look at all the evidence, flesh it out.
[02:17:34.336 --> 02:17:35.737]  Dylan, stay there.
[02:17:35.797 --> 02:17:38.340]  Let's come back and take a bunch of calls on the other side.
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:42.364]  And folks, if you want loose change, it's on Infowars.com.
[02:17:42.444 --> 02:17:43.645]  Right now, get your hard copy.
[02:17:45.788 --> 02:17:49.791]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[02:17:50.231 --> 02:17:53.693]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[02:17:54.153 --> 02:17:57.375]  Cardivite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[02:17:57.776 --> 02:18:02.359]  Made from seven herbs, cardivite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[02:18:02.379 --> 02:18:04.340]  Here's what one person has to say.
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:08.363]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[02:18:08.503 --> 02:18:12.326]  I don't have the tightness on my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[02:18:12.546 --> 02:18:13.747]  I tried all kinds of junk.
[02:18:13.947 --> 02:18:14.448]  It didn't do.
[02:18:14.548 --> 02:18:16.569]  The only thing that worked was your CardioVite.
[02:18:16.949 --> 02:18:19.291]  If you believe CardioVite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.

[02:19:47.703 --> 02:19:51.786]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:51.946 --> 02:19:54.808]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:54.888 --> 02:20:01.593]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:01.673 --> 02:20:01.753]  Yes.
[02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:04.796]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:04.997 --> 02:20:07.379]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:07.539 --> 02:20:17.670]  Like murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:26.993]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:20:27.153 --> 02:20:34.756]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:21:41.732 --> 02:22:03.865]  They wailed against the crowd, another red-tag band, declaring independence.
[02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:10.108]  Dylan Avery.
[02:22:10.328 --> 02:22:11.508]  I was talking to him during the break.
[02:22:11.568 --> 02:22:12.509]  It sounds like my life.
[02:22:12.549 --> 02:22:16.351]  He's dealing with DVD manufacturers not delivering stuff on time.
[02:22:16.991 --> 02:22:17.952]  Shipping stuff out.
[02:22:17.972 --> 02:22:18.812]  The nightmare of it.
[02:22:18.832 --> 02:22:20.653]  I remember doing it out of my house many years ago.
[02:22:20.673 --> 02:22:21.834]  And that's the point he's at.
[02:22:22.154 --> 02:22:24.835]  Trying to edit and make films while you're doing it.
[02:22:24.875 --> 02:22:26.896]  Trying to answer hundreds of emails and faxes.
[02:22:26.936 --> 02:22:27.676]  It's a lot of fun.
[02:22:28.057 --> 02:22:31.098]  And so I know the mode that Dylan's in.
[02:22:31.198 --> 02:22:32.419]  It's fun to be in the arena.
[02:22:33.099 --> 02:22:34.300]  These callers will be all over the map.
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:36.942]  They've been holding for eons, but it all ties back into the same stuff.
[02:22:36.963 --> 02:22:37.863]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:22:38.284 --> 02:22:39.224]  Thomas in Florida.
[02:22:39.244 --> 02:22:40.966]  You're on the air with Dylan Avery and Alex Jones.
[02:22:41.006 --> 02:22:41.526]  Welcome, sir.
[02:22:42.287 --> 02:22:43.008]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:43.608 --> 02:22:45.850]  It's a given that we appreciate you.
[02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:47.351]  I'll make this quick.
[02:22:47.411 --> 02:22:54.157]  This is a little off the mark, what you're talking about today, but yesterday I went in to get a regular physical for my insurance.
[02:22:54.577 --> 02:23:05.382]  And I'm sitting in the lobby and surrounded by books and things up on the wall talking about flu vaccine, get this vaccine, you know, vaccine yourself.
[02:23:05.723 --> 02:23:07.804]  And I go back in the back and they take my blood.
[02:23:09.111 --> 02:23:12.575]  And I'm still sitting there with the deal in my arm where they pulled it out of the nurse's sleeve.
[02:23:12.635 --> 02:23:16.358]  And she comes back in and she's got this syringe full of something.
[02:23:16.699 --> 02:23:17.960]  And she goes to start putting it in my arm.
[02:23:17.980 --> 02:23:18.981]  I said, what are you doing?
[02:23:19.001 --> 02:23:20.142]  What are you putting in my arm?
[02:23:20.482 --> 02:23:26.928]  And she said, well this is something we're going to be able to tell about your blood from now on of anything that's going on in your body.
[02:23:27.189 --> 02:23:28.210]  And I said, well what's in it?
[02:23:28.730 --> 02:23:30.111]  And she said, well, it won't hurt you.
[02:23:30.131 --> 02:23:30.571]  It's safe.
[02:23:30.611 --> 02:23:31.131]  Trust it.
[02:23:31.191 --> 02:23:32.832]  She wouldn't even tell you what it was?
[02:23:32.852 --> 02:23:35.553]  She couldn't tell me what it was.
[02:23:35.973 --> 02:23:38.554]  And then I said, well, you're not putting that in Mom.
[02:23:38.795 --> 02:23:42.156]  And she brings the doctor back there, and he couldn't even tell me what was in it.
[02:23:43.056 --> 02:23:45.017]  And I started asking... Well, sir, what were you there for?
[02:23:45.057 --> 02:23:46.278]  Was it a big city clinic?
[02:23:47.298 --> 02:23:48.459]  It was right up here in Sarasota.
[02:23:49.599 --> 02:23:55.381]  My regular physical for my insurance, which I have good health and I'm blessed with that.
[02:23:55.881 --> 02:24:02.324]  And just for my standards... Then we're going to put some kind of trait... Folks, this is what's getting crazy, is that I get reports of this all the time.
[02:24:02.364 --> 02:24:12.107]  They know the general public's dumbed down, and so they're doing... And again, we've had a government 3,000 plus times declassified use chemical, biologicals, and radiologicals on the American people.
[02:24:12.836 --> 02:24:20.563]  I mean, again, Israel radiated 110,000 of their own children, killed them for $3 billion from the U.S., you know, up until the 60s.
[02:24:21.103 --> 02:24:24.586]  Just type in, Israel radiated its own children, it'll pop up.
[02:24:24.626 --> 02:24:26.007]  Mainstream News, Israel.
[02:24:26.428 --> 02:24:33.154]  The same governments that admittedly have done all this in the past, now want us to totally trust them, and oh, they wouldn't be behind terror.
[02:24:33.414 --> 02:24:34.855]  Dylan Avery, you want to comment on this?
[02:24:36.917 --> 02:24:40.400]  Well, actually, I was reading up on Mumia Abu Jamal earlier, actually.
[02:24:40.971 --> 02:24:45.575]  I don't know if you know about him, but what happened to him happened back in the 1980s.
[02:24:46.696 --> 02:24:59.306]  Basically, this guy was a journalist, and he was a cab driver at night to pay his bills, and he was letting off a fare at like 2 or 3 in the morning, and he looks out his car window, and he sees his brother in the street.
[02:24:59.346 --> 02:25:03.489]  His brother got shot, and Mumia ran out there to check on his brother, and then
[02:25:03.996 --> 02:25:05.497]  He got jumped or something.
[02:25:05.517 --> 02:25:09.259]  He lost consciousness and when he woke up, the officer and his brother were dead.
[02:25:09.779 --> 02:25:11.900]  And then, uh, Mumia got picked up by an ambulance.
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:13.861]  It took like a half hour to get to the hospital.
[02:25:14.401 --> 02:25:17.743]  And basically what ended up happening is he got framed for the officer's death.
[02:25:18.363 --> 02:25:19.424]  And he's been in jail since 1983.
[02:25:19.524 --> 02:25:23.106]  And, um, I mean, this was back in the 1980s.
[02:25:23.146 --> 02:25:29.849]  I mean, this innocent black journalist in Philadelphia got framed for a brother and a police officer's murder.
[02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:31.410]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:25:32.944 --> 02:25:47.192]  There is so much bizarre stuff going on and happening, but I mean, all the stories of poor people going to the health department and get sterilized, I mean, that happened to, what, 400-something thousand women from the 1920s until 1980s.
[02:25:47.532 --> 02:25:48.353]  We've had them on.
[02:25:49.033 --> 02:25:52.155]  And so, is this the city health department?
[02:25:52.175 --> 02:25:55.597]  Did you go into some old city hospital to have this checkup?
[02:25:55.657 --> 02:25:57.117]  Where were you when they were doing this?
[02:25:57.498 --> 02:26:01.640]  This was in a high-end, you know, this is a high-end area down here anyway.
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:03.961]  Okay, so this was in a private clinic.
[02:26:04.081 --> 02:26:08.865]  This was in a private clinic for expensive insurance that I have.
[02:26:09.005 --> 02:26:11.346]  You know, and I've never made any claims, but here it gets better.
[02:26:11.547 --> 02:26:13.088]  But you did say no to the shot.
[02:26:13.348 --> 02:26:20.733]  I said no, and when he couldn't tell me, they came back and said, well, we cannot honor your insurance unless you take this.
[02:26:21.528 --> 02:26:23.168]  And, you know, I said, well, I'm leaving then.
[02:26:23.689 --> 02:26:26.609]  And, uh, when they start opening the door, they're walking me out.
[02:26:26.969 --> 02:26:30.550]  Alright, so when I got in the lobby, I sat there and said, you see all this stuff?
[02:26:30.570 --> 02:26:33.751]  To the people that were there, I said, you see all this stuff about vaccines on the wall?
[02:26:34.151 --> 02:26:39.073]  I asked the guy, the doctor was still behind me, I said, have you told everybody how much mercury is in these vaccines?
[02:26:39.433 --> 02:26:41.373]  His face got blood red.
[02:26:41.433 --> 02:26:44.274]  He turned over there to the receptionist and said, call the police.
[02:26:44.778 --> 02:26:48.119]  You know, I told them it was a piece of crap when they were throwing me out the front door.
[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:48.920]  Well, good.
[02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:50.480]  You don't need their trashy insurance.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:52.201]  Folks, I hear about this all the time.
[02:26:52.441 --> 02:26:58.724]  Listen, local news gets on, it happens nationwide, a month before school and says, you must take vaccines or you'll be arrested.
[02:26:58.944 --> 02:26:59.924]  There's no law!
[02:27:00.364 --> 02:27:08.788]  Listen, next summer, when you are watching it on TV, I don't care if you live in Albuquerque or in New York or Austin, and you're going to see it on every channel, it's the law, you'll be arrested.
[02:27:09.497 --> 02:27:11.238]  Call up and go, what's that law on the news?
[02:27:11.258 --> 02:27:12.319]  We were just told to say this.
[02:27:12.539 --> 02:27:13.720]  There's not even a law!
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:17.443]  And sir, the story you're telling, I'm getting all the time.
[02:27:18.083 --> 02:27:21.526]  You just go to the doctor, and we've got an injection for you.
[02:27:21.586 --> 02:27:22.186]  Well, what is that?
[02:27:22.987 --> 02:27:25.648]  You need to get out of here right now, boy.
[02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:28.971]  Because the drug companies are giving them money to do this.
[02:27:29.011 --> 02:27:32.573]  I mean, it's just... Oh my gosh.
[02:27:32.774 --> 02:27:33.434]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.936 --> 02:27:36.876]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.337 --> 02:27:38.838]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:42.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.241 --> 02:27:52.602]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.822 --> 02:27:57.824]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:58.164 --> 02:28:06.045]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.225 --> 02:28:13.267]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.487 --> 02:28:14.688]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:14.848 --> 02:28:18.230]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:19.410]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:19.691 --> 02:28:20.971]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.172 --> 02:28:27.995]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:28:45.856 --> 02:28:47.477]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.617 --> 02:28:51.720]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:54.742]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.802 --> 02:29:01.526]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.

[02:29:04.928 --> 02:29:07.310]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:12.153]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.333 --> 02:29:26.900]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:29:45.408 --> 02:29:46.508]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:29:46.828 --> 02:29:48.629]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:29:48.649 --> 02:29:50.170]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:50.570]  Yes.
[02:29:50.850 --> 02:29:51.690]  You neglect me.
[02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:53.851]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:29:55.672 --> 02:29:56.692]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:29:57.012 --> 02:29:57.893]  I'm getting sick.
[02:29:58.233 --> 02:30:00.394]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:30:01.454 --> 02:30:01.935]  Wait a minute.
[02:30:02.015 --> 02:30:03.615]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:30:03.876 --> 02:30:12.440]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add Protecta Engine Treatment, Protecta Transmission Treatment, and especially Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:18.363]  Protecta's unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:30:18.603 --> 02:30:20.984]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:30:21.124 --> 02:30:25.807]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:30:26.027 --> 02:30:27.688]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:30:27.868 --> 02:30:31.190]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:35.753]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:35.813 --> 02:30:37.134]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:37.154 --> 02:30:37.894]  We don't need no education.
[02:30:55.210 --> 02:30:59.214]  We don't need no thought control.
[02:30:59.414 --> 02:31:03.218]  No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[02:31:03.278 --> 02:31:07.162]  Teacher leave them kids alone.
[02:31:23.363 --> 02:31:31.306]  Folks, I have no way of verifying what that caller just told us, but I'm going to ask him to send us an email detailing it with names, everything.
[02:31:31.326 --> 02:31:32.806]  I will try to investigate it.
[02:31:33.987 --> 02:31:34.707]  But I know this.
[02:31:34.807 --> 02:31:42.910]  All over the country, again, I mean, G.I.s over and over again would go in and they'd go, oh, free health care for your children.
[02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:45.651]  And our government would just put little kids in a chamber and kill them.
[02:31:46.071 --> 02:31:46.911]  Your kid's dead.
[02:31:47.751 --> 02:31:48.772]  That's Time Magazine.
[02:31:48.792 --> 02:31:49.852]  They'll just calmly report it.
[02:31:49.912 --> 02:31:51.993]  Or pregnant wives go in to have babies.
[02:31:52.933 --> 02:31:59.055]  Back down to the troops and they'd give them uranium, plutonium pills, and tell them, now if you don't feel good taking these vitamins, come right in here.
[02:31:59.435 --> 02:32:04.637]  And they'd have doctors on standby with film cameras rolling just to see how the baby died.
[02:32:05.237 --> 02:32:05.917]  Oh, don't believe me?
[02:32:06.017 --> 02:32:09.778]  I mean, I had this thing where talk show hosts, when I'm doing an interview, don't believe me?
[02:32:09.858 --> 02:32:12.179]  I'm not a betting man, but I'll go, 10 grand right now.
[02:32:12.339 --> 02:32:13.079]  Come on, 10 grand!
[02:32:13.099 --> 02:32:14.640]  10 grand, don't believe me?
[02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:17.501]  Don't believe me that Israel irradiated 110,000 children?
[02:32:20.073 --> 02:32:23.117]  Most of them, of course, died within just a week or so.
[02:32:24.018 --> 02:32:24.538]  Don't believe me?
[02:32:24.578 --> 02:32:26.360]  Don't believe it's in mainstream newspapers over there?
[02:32:26.401 --> 02:32:31.046]  Just calmly announced like they're reporting on the price of petrol or something.
[02:32:32.127 --> 02:32:33.028]  I mean, it's that simple.
[02:32:33.935 --> 02:32:38.176]  I mean, you see, you want to know why I freak out, why I'm always going wild?
[02:32:38.236 --> 02:32:42.237]  Because, I mean, I'm just a bunch of psychopathic killers running everything right in front of us.
[02:32:42.877 --> 02:32:50.879]  And I know, I mean, the black men in Tuskegee, they'd go in, they'd have syphilis, they'd let them die of it over 40, 50 years, and now the evidence shows they were giving them syphilis?
[02:32:50.919 --> 02:32:51.919]  Imagine, poor black men.
[02:32:52.339 --> 02:32:56.400]  I'm going in to see the doctor, you're in Alabama, and you go in,
[02:32:57.225 --> 02:32:57.925]  Hello, doctor.
[02:32:57.945 --> 02:32:58.705]  I appreciate your help.
[02:32:58.765 --> 02:33:01.406]  And that doctor's like, yes, we'll take care of you here.
[02:33:03.266 --> 02:33:05.427]  Now you'll... I mean, it's so sick!
[02:33:05.747 --> 02:33:08.028]  And everybody just wants to be a bunch of naive idiots!
[02:33:08.208 --> 02:33:09.288]  What's wrong with us?
[02:33:09.548 --> 02:33:12.029]  I'm not a braying sheep in a pen that's gonna take it!
[02:33:13.889 --> 02:33:17.330]  And, uh, yeah, I've talked to people who go in, and they'll just really push these shots on you.
[02:33:17.350 --> 02:33:19.170]  They're putting all kinds of weird stuff in them.
[02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.171]  The doctors won't even ask what it is.
[02:33:21.191 --> 02:33:22.471]  They're just getting some bounty.
[02:33:22.911 --> 02:33:25.312]  And believe me, these insurance companies are the worst.
[02:33:27.388 --> 02:33:34.872]  I mean, Bill and Avery, do you ever just get totally flipped out like I do just by how crazy everything that's admitted is?
[02:33:35.633 --> 02:33:36.854]  Yeah, all the time.
[02:33:36.874 --> 02:33:40.576]  That's why I try to take a break now and then and try to keep myself somewhat sane.
[02:33:40.596 --> 02:33:44.198]  I mean, it really is insane.
[02:33:44.218 --> 02:33:54.664]  I mean, when you know that, I mean, folks, they'll take our troops and put them out in the field and fly over and nerve gas them and just kill them.
[02:33:55.587 --> 02:34:05.393]  Over and over again, and it can be in the BBC, and it's just, oh, government kills you, it's just, you trust them though, they wouldn't, they're fighting Al-Qaeda, man, Iran's a real threat.
[02:34:07.014 --> 02:34:07.875]  Yeah, yeah, right.
[02:34:09.816 --> 02:34:16.640]  Oh, man, you, Alex, you need to have Corey on your show sometime, because he was in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he would have tons of things to tell you about the war.
[02:34:16.941 --> 02:34:18.782]  He's one of the guys that worked on the film.
[02:34:19.082 --> 02:34:20.183]  Now, yeah, tell us about Corey.
[02:34:20.763 --> 02:34:23.625]  Corey, well, he and I have been friends for
[02:34:24.574 --> 02:34:25.435]  Basically, forever.
[02:34:25.455 --> 02:34:28.416]  Not our entire lives, but we're definitely best friends.
[02:34:28.436 --> 02:34:30.077]  Soul brothers!
[02:34:30.717 --> 02:34:31.598]  Yeah, basically.
[02:34:32.698 --> 02:34:36.681]  We ran into each other when we started doing a paper route together, and we've been best friends ever since.
[02:34:37.641 --> 02:34:44.385]  Back in August 2001, Cory enlisted to the Army, and his first day of basic training was September 11th, 2001.
[02:34:45.185 --> 02:34:48.067]  And within two or three months, he was in Afghanistan.
[02:34:48.887 --> 02:34:50.588]  And then, when he was in Afghanistan,
[02:34:51.027 --> 02:34:51.748]  He emailed me.
[02:34:51.788 --> 02:34:53.369]  He was like, yeah, I'm in Afghanistan now.
[02:34:53.409 --> 02:34:54.810]  We're probably going to Iraq next.
[02:34:55.330 --> 02:34:56.171]  And that was in November 2001.
[02:34:56.611 --> 02:34:58.953]  And the troops knew they were going to Iraq.
[02:34:58.973 --> 02:34:59.613]  Well, they didn't know.
[02:34:59.633 --> 02:35:01.574]  I guess it was more like a joke among the troops.
[02:35:02.195 --> 02:35:06.138]  But basically, Corey just got out of the Army this past summer.
[02:35:06.258 --> 02:35:06.478]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:06.498 --> 02:35:09.280]  I think I've heard of Corey on Jack Blood Show.
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:10.741]  Yeah, you probably have.
[02:35:10.821 --> 02:35:14.123]  And he's got out of the Army and he's been fighting the good fight ever since.
[02:35:15.624 --> 02:35:17.866]  And didn't he work with you on the new film?
[02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:20.451]  Yeah, he's my producer and advisor.
[02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:26.836]  I'm the one that does the editing and all the work, but he stands over my shoulder, gives me advice, tells me what looks good, what doesn't.
[02:35:27.257 --> 02:35:28.418]  That's a producer's job.
[02:35:29.258 --> 02:35:33.322]  Well, that's why the New Order's got a problem, is their troops, their military, their police.
[02:35:33.422 --> 02:35:35.784]  We are turning them to the light every day.
[02:35:35.804 --> 02:35:37.646]  They are coming over to America.
[02:35:38.026 --> 02:35:38.887]  They are coming home.
[02:35:38.927 --> 02:35:44.632]  They are coming home to decency and honor and beauty and love and just everything wholesome.
[02:35:45.439 --> 02:35:47.520]  And they are feeling so good when they do it.
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:50.142]  They are being empowered to be the warriors they truly are.
[02:35:50.942 --> 02:35:52.403]  And the New World Order needs to know this.
[02:35:52.443 --> 02:35:53.464]  We're not going down easy.
[02:35:53.484 --> 02:35:54.824]  We're not going down without a fight.
[02:35:55.125 --> 02:35:56.165]  We know who you are.
[02:35:56.225 --> 02:35:57.166]  We know what you've done.
[02:35:57.186 --> 02:36:01.308]  And we know what you're trying to set up will make all your previous crimes pale in significance.
[02:36:01.388 --> 02:36:03.409]  And I just want them to know, you've got to fight!
[02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:06.211]  You don't control all of us and our numbers are growing.
[02:36:06.451 --> 02:36:07.652]  You want to tell them that, Dylan?
[02:36:08.533 --> 02:36:09.234]  Yeah, yep.
[02:36:09.634 --> 02:36:10.515]  That's what I'm doing, man.
[02:36:10.555 --> 02:36:11.336]  I'm doing my part.
[02:36:12.197 --> 02:36:13.979]  Are you taking them on at point-blank range?
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:15.060]  Yeah.
[02:36:15.240 --> 02:36:16.942]  Engaging enemy formations?
[02:36:17.482 --> 02:36:22.908]  Hey, man, if you could get me within speaking distance of any of these people, seriously, I'll get some answers out of them.
[02:36:23.789 --> 02:36:25.911]  I mean, I would love to be in a room with George Bush.
[02:36:26.031 --> 02:36:26.732]  I would love it.
[02:36:28.906 --> 02:36:30.808]  Let's take a couple more calls.
[02:36:30.848 --> 02:36:33.870]  Again, if you want to get Loose Change, it's on InfoWars.com.
[02:36:33.890 --> 02:36:37.774]  Dylan graciously has authorized me to post it on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[02:36:37.794 --> 02:36:38.875]  That'll be up by next week.
[02:36:40.196 --> 02:36:44.139]  Just such a wonderful film, and we're so honored to have Dylan with us.
[02:36:44.159 --> 02:36:45.560]  If you want to get a copy of it, it's 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.982]  And just a testament to Dylan and his crew,
[02:36:56.298 --> 02:37:00.721]  Again, 19 years old, sees what's happening, goes and does the research, puts a film together.
[02:37:00.741 --> 02:37:05.763]  There have been other great films made by 60-year-old people, or films made by 30-year-old folks.
[02:37:06.784 --> 02:37:07.644]  It doesn't matter.
[02:37:07.745 --> 02:37:08.745]  It's the information.
[02:37:08.805 --> 02:37:09.345]  I've looked at it.
[02:37:09.385 --> 02:37:10.646]  It's good information.
[02:37:10.686 --> 02:37:11.347]  It's important.
[02:37:11.667 --> 02:37:13.428]  It's very effective at waking people up.
[02:37:14.674 --> 02:37:17.135]  We're doing a lot of things right now.
[02:37:17.175 --> 02:37:18.136]  Like I told you over the break,
[02:37:33.178 --> 02:37:35.780]  We kind of got shot down at the last minute by our last point.
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:40.442]  No, I understand, but you just got more in, but it's good to be selling out of something.
[02:37:40.702 --> 02:37:44.204]  Let's go ahead here and go back to the calls.
[02:37:44.705 --> 02:37:46.126]  Mike in Oregon.
[02:37:46.146 --> 02:37:46.806]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:37:47.446 --> 02:37:49.828]  Hey Alex, I just have a couple quick questions.
[02:37:50.008 --> 02:37:50.908]  First one to Dylan.
[02:37:50.948 --> 02:37:54.530]  I just wanted to know if he's found himself on the no-fly list.
[02:37:55.131 --> 02:37:57.052]  And Alex, I know you're not, and I was wondering
[02:37:57.981 --> 02:38:00.407]  I find it weird that you're not on the no fly list.
[02:38:00.808 --> 02:38:01.489]  My dad is.
[02:38:01.970 --> 02:38:02.411]  Your dad is?
[02:38:02.832 --> 02:38:04.636]  Yes, because
[02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:10.312]  They do it selectively, and they know I'll scream bloody murder and make a big deal out of it.
[02:38:10.352 --> 02:38:11.512]  I mean, Ted Kennedy is.
[02:38:12.273 --> 02:38:19.357]  My dad, because his name is so common, Jones is very common, and his first name is even more common, and so he needs that.
[02:38:19.557 --> 02:38:21.438]  He started adding his middle initial.
[02:38:21.518 --> 02:38:24.960]  In his case, it really is a mistake, because there's so many people.
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:28.542]  I mean, there's got to be tens of thousands with his name just in the U.S.
[02:38:28.602 --> 02:38:31.984]  alone, and then in Western Europe and England, there's just as many.
[02:38:32.004 --> 02:38:33.605]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:38:34.966 --> 02:38:48.053]  But, and so they did advise people that if you're having trouble with a really common name, that what you do is you just add your initial, or maybe your initial is matching somebody, you take your initial out, and you get through.
[02:38:48.073 --> 02:38:55.937]  You know, it's like four-year-olds that can't fly because their name is the same as somebody else, and TSA goes, we know you're not him, but sorry you can't fly.
[02:38:55.997 --> 02:38:59.800]  So there is some clear harassment, but at the same time there's not harassment.
[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:02.041]  Like there's been Green Party people who are going to fly to
[02:39:02.561 --> 02:39:05.465]  You know, from Maine to Minneapolis-St.
[02:39:05.505 --> 02:39:10.071]  Paul for a Green Party meeting, and they find out they're on the list because they don't like their politics.
[02:39:10.872 --> 02:39:13.075]  Look, they've already attacked me physically.
[02:39:13.375 --> 02:39:17.761]  They've already done all kinds of stuff to me, and they know I increase my attack every time they do.
[02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:18.662]  I mean, that's my rule.
[02:39:19.705 --> 02:39:23.729]  And I always intensify the attack every time I'm attacked.
[02:39:23.749 --> 02:39:26.732]  They understand that's my instinctive mode.
[02:39:26.912 --> 02:39:28.134]  I don't run, I fight.
[02:39:28.734 --> 02:39:34.220]  You can fight or flight, or you can grovel and go into a catatonic unnatural state.
[02:39:34.601 --> 02:39:40.147]  I don't run, unless I believe that's the right thing to do, but generally my instincts are don't.
[02:39:40.527 --> 02:39:42.930]  And I never really have, but I'm not saying I wouldn't.
[02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:46.173]  I'm not going to say that there's not a place for that.
[02:39:46.534 --> 02:39:49.597]  No one to hold them, no one to fold them, no one to walk away, no one to run.
[02:39:51.839 --> 02:39:53.100]  People ask, why am I alive?
[02:39:53.361 --> 02:39:55.263]  Because they don't want to make me a martyr, folks!
[02:39:56.175 --> 02:39:58.018]  Now, may there be a fake mugging?
[02:39:58.058 --> 02:39:59.981]  May I get killed in a drive-by?
[02:40:00.001 --> 02:40:02.144]  Then they grab some crackhead and blame it on him.
[02:40:02.324 --> 02:40:02.885]  Could that happen?
[02:40:02.925 --> 02:40:04.247]  Yeah, but we're all going to die.
[02:40:04.447 --> 02:40:08.172]  You know, and again, the number one cause of death is getting on the highway.
[02:40:08.573 --> 02:40:11.097]  Until you're 55, and it's heart attacks and cancer, respectively.
[02:40:11.797 --> 02:40:16.340]  But we all still get in our cars and hurl down the road at 80 miles an hour with 18 wheelers right beside us.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:27.846]  I was driving up to a car dealership to pick up my car that had some work done on it, Saturday, and I saw a pickup truck all smashed with them cutting the guy out, tuned into the news later driving back, and he was dead!
[02:40:28.596 --> 02:40:37.442]  Now, Al-Qaeda didn't kill him, George Bush didn't kill him, Chewbacabra didn't kill him, and all this lions and tigers and bears didn't kill him.
[02:40:37.482 --> 02:40:40.004]  It was a car hurtling down I-35.
[02:40:40.044 --> 02:40:41.745]  And we all make that decision every day.
[02:40:41.945 --> 02:40:46.228]  We put our kids in the car, we drive out on the road, but then we're all quaking in fear of the government.
[02:40:46.589 --> 02:40:49.211]  Listen, man, life's too short to be afraid of dying.
[02:40:49.791 --> 02:40:50.692]  I am not afraid.
[02:40:51.312 --> 02:40:56.676]  And it's not even some heroic thing to just gut up and get past your fear.
[02:40:57.536 --> 02:40:57.976]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:58.216 --> 02:40:58.917]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:40:59.997 --> 02:41:01.698]  No, just wondering if Dylan's on the list.
[02:41:02.898 --> 02:41:03.478]  No, I'm not.
[02:41:03.578 --> 02:41:06.299]  As of last July, I flew out to California.
[02:41:06.319 --> 02:41:11.141]  I plan on going back in the next couple months, so if I get shot down at the ticket counter, I'll definitely let you know.
[02:41:12.802 --> 02:41:14.102]  And also, just a quick one, Alex.
[02:41:14.162 --> 02:41:16.123]  Do you give fellow filmmakers sort of like a
[02:41:17.329 --> 02:41:22.814]  A blanket, I guess, approval to use your voice or image in documentaries to help get the word out?
[02:41:22.974 --> 02:41:28.999]  You know, I can't sit here on the radio and just say, oh, blanket, you can do whatever you want because of my enemies will do stuff.
[02:41:29.879 --> 02:41:37.786]  But I've authorized people for non-profit educational purposes, that is giving my videos away, that you can do that because it's all fair use.
[02:41:38.386 --> 02:41:48.695]  But I do reserve the right to revoke people who are abusing it, so there isn't just a blanket carte blanche thing.
[02:41:48.775 --> 02:41:59.884]  But under fair use, you don't have to ask my permission if you want to use a very small portion of what I'm doing, or if you are critiquing what I'm doing, either good or bad.
[02:41:59.904 --> 02:42:01.585]  So you need to look into the law on that.
[02:42:01.625 --> 02:42:02.306]  Thank you for the call.
[02:42:03.207 --> 02:42:05.589]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Missouri.
[02:42:05.629 --> 02:42:06.409]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:42:06.449 --> 02:42:06.790]  Go ahead.
[02:42:07.470 --> 02:42:09.492]  Um, hey Dylan, just calling to say hi.
[02:42:09.532 --> 02:42:10.232]  How you doing, man?
[02:42:11.493 --> 02:42:12.734]  I'm trying to do my best, buddy.
[02:42:12.754 --> 02:42:13.214]  How about you?
[02:42:13.454 --> 02:42:14.254]  Oh, just fine.
[02:42:14.595 --> 02:42:16.516]  I'm really sorry to hear about that distributor.
[02:42:16.536 --> 02:42:17.697]  That was not very nice.
[02:42:19.098 --> 02:42:21.599]  Yeah, it's alright, man.
[02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.480]  Let's move on to some information.
[02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:25.982]  Anything you want to talk about the New World Order concentration camps?
[02:42:26.002 --> 02:42:29.664]  You know, we had a big professor on last hour saying he doesn't know if we'll make it.
[02:42:29.704 --> 02:42:31.225]  We may go into total martial law.
[02:42:31.745 --> 02:42:33.567]  Any comments on something like that or anything?
[02:42:34.347 --> 02:42:35.548]  Actually, yeah, I disagree.
[02:42:36.283 --> 02:42:38.304]  With the pessimism.
[02:42:38.824 --> 02:42:40.524]  In all honesty, it's going to fall.
[02:42:41.604 --> 02:42:42.445]  It is going to fall.
[02:42:43.025 --> 02:42:45.706]  This Patriot Act, it's going to burn.
[02:42:46.566 --> 02:42:55.608]  It's going to go away, because people have waken up now and they're realizing what they've seen in front of them is, you know, Toto, I'm not in Kansas anymore.
[02:42:56.448 --> 02:42:57.329]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:59.989]  I think the illusion is disappearing.
[02:43:00.009 --> 02:43:03.130]  I mean, I think people are really seeing through things.
[02:43:04.291 --> 02:43:04.811]  Exactly.
[02:43:06.465 --> 02:43:16.332]  Similar thing, I predict similar things are going to happen here that happened in like Great Britain a long time ago when they had similar things with supposed terrorist attacks.
[02:43:16.852 --> 02:43:27.300]  People in the government, people will, you know, go into office and then suddenly realize this legislation defeats the purpose of our form of government.
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:29.321]  Let's get rid of this legislation.
[02:43:29.341 --> 02:43:32.764]  Yeah, it's good to talk about repealing things.
[02:43:32.824 --> 02:43:33.804]  I appreciate the call.
[02:43:33.924 --> 02:43:35.966]  Matt in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:43:36.858 --> 02:43:38.660]  Yes, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:40.802]  I just want to thank you all for all that you do.
[02:43:40.822 --> 02:43:44.765]  I had a comment about the title, Loose Change.
[02:43:47.128 --> 02:43:48.509]  What I first thought it was about,
[02:43:49.255 --> 02:43:54.636]  I thought it might be about the gold that was missing out of the bottom of the World Trade Center in the economic... That's right.
[02:43:55.176 --> 02:43:56.697]  A hundred and something billion.
[02:43:56.797 --> 02:43:59.477]  Admittedly there, gold doesn't disappear, folks.
[02:44:00.298 --> 02:44:03.458]  And then there's just no discussion about it now.
[02:44:03.778 --> 02:44:07.959]  You ask the media, they go, we're not going to talk about those Federal Reserve vaults, Dylan.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.980]  Yeah, we actually cover that in the conclusion of the second edition.
[02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:18.222]  Go over the gold that was missing in the empty dump trucks and the convoy of cars that was found underneath World Trade Center for
[02:44:19.161 --> 02:44:23.066]  No bodies recovered, which means basically these people got out of their trucks and started running.
[02:44:23.593 --> 02:44:25.694]  I mean, how did they know the South Tower was going to collapse?
[02:44:25.914 --> 02:44:34.558]  Do you remember Die Hard 3, where the Germans carry out a terror attack, but really it's a diversion to rob the World Trade Center vaults?
[02:44:35.159 --> 02:44:37.680]  The Germans just love doing stuff like this.
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:39.301]  They love it.
[02:44:40.101 --> 02:44:50.886]  They have a Fox TV special, Lone Gunman, where a government group hijacks a jet to fly it by remote control, and blame it on hijackers, into the World Trade Center so they can attack Afghanistan.
[02:44:51.106 --> 02:44:52.507]  Then I have Dean Haglund on
[02:44:53.047 --> 02:44:57.288]  From the start of the show, saying that the CIA was planning those stories on them.
[02:44:58.448 --> 02:44:59.969]  I mean, how much more obvious is that?
[02:45:01.169 --> 02:45:02.789]  It doesn't get much more obvious than that, Matt.
[02:45:04.290 --> 02:45:06.990]  No, it doesn't get much more obvious than that.
[02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:09.111]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying there, Matt.
[02:45:09.611 --> 02:45:20.093]  Well, I'd like to add that I was just talking to my rep at MIDAS yesterday, and he informed me that the M3 money supply figures are going to be discontinued
[02:45:20.979 --> 02:45:25.500]  In March, and that's what I think makes the gold so pertinent.
[02:45:25.801 --> 02:45:26.401]  That's right.
[02:45:27.121 --> 02:45:34.263]  If you thought that Alan Greenspan printed money and drove down the value of the dollar by roughly 45%, get ready for this new guy.
[02:45:34.363 --> 02:45:35.964]  He is called Mr. Helicopter.
[02:45:36.304 --> 02:45:39.765]  He said he wants to just literally dump money out of helicopters.
[02:45:40.545 --> 02:45:43.466]  Sounds good until you realize that it'll be worth toilet paper.
[02:45:44.122 --> 02:45:45.903]  Right, and that's how they're really getting us.
[02:45:45.943 --> 02:45:49.664]  That's my personal interest, is what they're doing to us economically, Alex.
[02:45:50.084 --> 02:45:53.745]  But I'll tell you what, you guys just keep up what you're doing, and I'm going to keep listening.
[02:45:53.785 --> 02:45:54.345]  Thanks a lot.
[02:45:55.105 --> 02:45:55.505]  I hear you.
[02:45:55.525 --> 02:45:56.265]  I appreciate it.
[02:45:56.666 --> 02:45:59.486]  Listen, folks, we have the strongest currency in the world.
[02:46:00.507 --> 02:46:05.428]  It is now barely first world status, about to drop into major third world status.
[02:46:05.448 --> 02:46:07.208]  I mean, you know, we all joke about Mexico.
[02:46:07.789 --> 02:46:10.469]  You can go down there with a hundred bucks and live for a week.
[02:46:11.009 --> 02:46:12.710]  They've got a junk currency.
[02:46:13.323 --> 02:46:18.149]  But Americans have been brainwashed to avoid any confrontation or something threatening to their paradigm.
[02:46:18.509 --> 02:46:21.272]  So now I talk to businessmen, I go, you know, the dollar's been devalued.
[02:46:21.312 --> 02:46:22.073]  And they go, huh?
[02:46:22.113 --> 02:46:23.175]  What's that mean?
[02:46:23.535 --> 02:46:25.097]  Well, the dollar's been devalued.
[02:46:25.117 --> 02:46:28.361]  Our currency, you know, Bush gives you a little 5% tax cut.
[02:46:30.151 --> 02:46:34.134]  Yeah, I'm definitely going to turn my money into gold as soon as possible, without a doubt.
[02:46:52.907 --> 02:46:58.171]  Well, I mean, obviously, folks, this network's owned by a company that sells gold.
[02:46:58.771 --> 02:47:01.433]  But, I mean, that's where I bought my gold.
[02:47:01.453 --> 02:47:03.134]  I bought some from Midas Resources.
[02:47:03.174 --> 02:47:04.896]  I guess about five, six different buys.
[02:47:04.936 --> 02:47:06.036]  No more than that over the years.
[02:47:06.096 --> 02:47:07.337]  A few coins here, a few coins there.
[02:47:07.377 --> 02:47:11.100]  But, you know, regardless, I don't have to sit there and stand on trust to me.
[02:47:11.961 --> 02:47:17.505]  Gold has doubled in value in the last five years, and the stock market has gone down.
[02:47:18.305 --> 02:47:19.706]  And then people go, well, it's at 11,000, Alex.
[02:47:21.525 --> 02:47:24.047]  Uh, they take out any losers from it.
[02:47:24.567 --> 02:47:25.948]  You see, everything is cooked.
[02:47:26.509 --> 02:47:27.429]  Everything is cooked.
[02:47:27.509 --> 02:47:28.490]  The numbers are cooked.
[02:47:30.031 --> 02:47:30.752]  So, I don't know.
[02:47:30.772 --> 02:47:31.692]  Don't listen to me.
[02:47:31.773 --> 02:47:33.274]  Double your money or don't.
[02:47:33.334 --> 02:47:35.335]  See, I didn't dump my gold when it doubled.
[02:47:35.415 --> 02:47:36.416]  I'm holding on to it.
[02:47:36.756 --> 02:47:38.938]  Because at least it's got some intrinsic value.
[02:47:38.978 --> 02:47:39.798]  It is not paper.
[02:47:44.982 --> 02:47:46.103]  So, any more callers?
[02:47:46.613 --> 02:47:49.854]  We're going to go to some after this quick break, Dylan.
[02:47:49.874 --> 02:47:51.314]  We're going to go to break here.
[02:47:51.334 --> 02:47:58.196]  And then we're going to come back and start taking a few more final phone calls here in the final segment.
[02:47:58.236 --> 02:48:07.119]  But just so I can understand this, you are now going to try to make a feature film out of what really happened on 9-11?
[02:48:08.059 --> 02:48:09.079]  Yeah, we're going to do our best.
[02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:14.481]  I mean, we have limited resources, but hopefully if everything goes right this year, we'll have
[02:48:15.296 --> 02:48:17.317]  Enough within our hands to film the movie.
[02:48:17.797 --> 02:48:19.998]  Well, it'd be great to have Mel Gibson make that movie.
[02:48:21.878 --> 02:48:23.979]  Actually, you should get me in touch with Robert Rodriguez.
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:29.301]  Yeah, I don't know if Robert Rodriguez would want to do something like that.
[02:48:30.341 --> 02:48:31.302]  Yeah, probably not.
[02:48:31.682 --> 02:48:32.082]  Who knows?
[02:48:32.122 --> 02:48:32.542]  He might.
[02:48:33.983 --> 02:48:35.403]  I know Richard Linklater pretty good.
[02:48:35.423 --> 02:48:36.704]  I don't really know Robert very well.
[02:48:37.244 --> 02:48:39.605]  But we'll be right back with Dylan Avery.
[02:48:39.625 --> 02:48:40.005]  Stay with us.
[02:48:42.025 --> 02:48:47.150]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.311 --> 02:48:50.414]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.534 --> 02:48:54.438]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.478 --> 02:48:58.722]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.063 --> 02:49:02.847]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.987 --> 02:49:04.789]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.069 --> 02:49:08.251]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.311 --> 02:49:13.034]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.174 --> 02:49:16.215]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.395 --> 02:49:19.277]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.757 --> 02:49:25.881]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.401 --> 02:49:30.203]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:30.603 --> 02:49:31.964]  Order your video today.
[02:49:32.364 --> 02:49:33.405]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:49:45.223 --> 02:49:50.447]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.587 --> 02:49:58.673]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:58.933 --> 02:50:05.998]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.158 --> 02:50:07.439]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:07.519 --> 02:50:13.422]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.602 --> 02:50:18.705]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.805 --> 02:50:27.691]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:27.951 --> 02:50:31.253]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:49.753 --> 02:51:51.294]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.794 --> 02:51:59.578]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.658 --> 02:52:02.240]  Very, very busy out there fighting the New World Order.
[02:52:03.248 --> 02:52:03.908]  And that's good.
[02:52:03.928 --> 02:52:06.470]  We'll talk to Reuben in a day, that'll be it for calls.
[02:52:06.490 --> 02:52:07.670]  This has been a great broadcast today.
[02:52:07.690 --> 02:52:09.471]  I want to thank all of our guests that came on.
[02:52:09.491 --> 02:52:18.136]  If you missed the interview in the last hour with the professor from Notre Dame, Notre Dame University, who debated this John Yoo about how the government says they can torture children in front of their parents.
[02:52:18.156 --> 02:52:19.516]  I mean, this is getting sick.
[02:52:19.556 --> 02:52:21.237]  If you missed that, it's coming back up tonight.
[02:52:21.257 --> 02:52:22.398]  You want to tune in for that.
[02:52:23.398 --> 02:52:24.619]  Reuben in Ohio.
[02:52:24.659 --> 02:52:25.199]  You're on the air.
[02:52:25.259 --> 02:52:25.839]  Go ahead, Reuben.
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:27.520]  Hey, thanks.
[02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:32.643]  My favorite part of Loose Change is where you show the jet turbine blowing
[02:52:33.336 --> 02:52:36.839]  I think it's an ambulance or a car away from it as it approaches on a runway.
[02:52:36.859 --> 02:52:46.006]  Proving that a 747 couldn't have flown over that highway without tumbling cars over hitting the Pentagon.
[02:52:47.287 --> 02:52:59.097]  Yeah, the reason I removed that clip from the second edition of Loose Change is because there was some speculation that that video was actually a computer simulation or like something that was staged and not actually real, so... Was it real?
[02:53:00.525 --> 02:53:02.166]  I don't know, I heard a couple different claims.
[02:53:02.186 --> 02:53:03.768]  Some people said it was real, some people said it wasn't.
[02:53:03.788 --> 02:53:05.809]  I couldn't really get much of a verifiable source.
[02:53:06.350 --> 02:53:11.574]  Regardless, the Pentagon stinks from every different angle, and I think it's important to look at it in the film.
[02:53:12.015 --> 02:53:12.936]  The film does that.
[02:53:12.996 --> 02:53:13.736]  Anything else, Reuben?
[02:53:14.297 --> 02:53:19.522]  There's a guy on TV pushing this book, Kevin Trudeau, National Curse, I want you to know about.
[02:53:19.662 --> 02:53:21.103]  And I was watching last night, and I'm thinking,
[02:53:21.584 --> 02:53:27.589]  Why doesn't Alex Jones or Dylan Avery push their 9-11 videos on Infomercial?
[02:53:27.649 --> 02:53:28.289]  Is that possible?
[02:53:28.330 --> 02:53:31.072]  You know, I don't think that at this point it's a great idea.
[02:53:31.152 --> 02:53:32.013]  People should do it.
[02:53:32.073 --> 02:53:33.714]  If somebody else does it more power to them.
[02:53:33.754 --> 02:53:34.855]  My goal is to get the word out.
[02:53:35.776 --> 02:53:37.017]  They can refuse.
[02:53:37.037 --> 02:53:39.158]  I know a few have actually tried similar things.
[02:53:39.178 --> 02:53:41.060]  They can refuse to let you buy time on them.
[02:53:42.303 --> 02:53:42.784]  I think so.
[02:54:00.206 --> 02:54:02.990]  According to some, I'm bad that I say make copies of my videos.
[02:54:03.090 --> 02:54:04.091]  I shouldn't even sell them.
[02:54:04.392 --> 02:54:07.095]  The problem is that we couldn't even make films if we didn't sell films.
[02:54:07.135 --> 02:54:11.020]  But that's the COINTELPRO people that don't want us to even be able to fight the New World Order.
[02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:12.041]  Thank you, Rubin, for the call.
[02:54:12.502 --> 02:54:14.945]  Dave in Connecticut, that's a great idea from Rubin, isn't it?
[02:54:15.967 --> 02:54:16.948]  That's a great idea, Dylan.
[02:54:17.603 --> 02:54:18.224]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:54:18.264 --> 02:54:20.246]  Let's talk to Dave in Connecticut.
[02:54:20.266 --> 02:54:21.047]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:54:21.107 --> 02:54:21.527]  Go ahead.
[02:54:21.767 --> 02:54:22.228]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:22.308 --> 02:54:22.769]  How are you?
[02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:23.149]  Good.
[02:54:23.169 --> 02:54:25.772]  Listen, I'm worried about the economics of the situation.
[02:54:25.792 --> 02:54:30.397]  I agree that the Patriot Act might get turned down, but I'll give you an example.
[02:54:30.477 --> 02:54:32.519]  Regional news up here in the Connecticut area.
[02:54:32.979 --> 02:54:37.764]  An iconic company, something you're going to be very familiar with, Winchester Repeating Arms.
[02:54:37.784 --> 02:54:39.726]  They're going to be closing the plant in 60 days.
[02:54:40.748 --> 02:54:41.709]  Sixty days, Alex.
[02:54:41.789 --> 02:54:42.990]  Winchester repeating arms.
[02:54:43.310 --> 02:54:44.511]  The gun that won the West.
[02:54:44.551 --> 02:54:46.733]  And you want to know what they're thinking of reopening the plant?
[02:54:47.433 --> 02:54:49.475]  I thought Winchester was already in Japan.
[02:54:49.835 --> 02:55:00.184]  No, well, there's a New Haven plant here, and they're making stuff, and they're going to be closing it, and it's going to be going, the rest of the operation, if they've got some of it there, is going to be going to China.
[02:55:00.712 --> 02:55:04.975]  Yeah, I knew Japan actually had manufacturing plants in China.
[02:55:05.035 --> 02:55:06.716]  I thought it was a Japanese operation.
[02:55:06.796 --> 02:55:12.860]  Well, according to what I'm hearing from the mayor of New Haven on the local news, which of course you can take what you take, he's trying to stop it.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.382]  But I'll give you another quick example.
[02:55:15.482 --> 02:55:19.765]  I worked for the world's largest oil company, won't mention their name, for five years.
[02:55:19.865 --> 02:55:20.525]  ExxonMobil.
[02:55:20.725 --> 02:55:20.946]  Right.
[02:55:21.006 --> 02:55:22.687]  They closed the plant in Connecticut.
[02:55:22.767 --> 02:55:30.272]  It was a plastics manufacturing facility because the price of resin went up when they helped raise, by the way, said it wasn't making any money.
[02:55:30.905 --> 02:55:32.066]  Yeah, I think.
[02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:45.271]  They're closing the plant.
[02:55:45.351 --> 02:55:46.492]  Hey, that's a great economy.
[02:55:46.512 --> 02:55:47.353]  The economy's great.
[02:55:47.393 --> 02:55:48.994]  It's a liberal lie that it isn't.
[02:55:49.535 --> 02:55:50.496]  Thank you for the call, Dave.
[02:55:50.516 --> 02:55:51.036]  Great points.
[02:55:51.156 --> 02:55:53.678]  Dylan Avery, again, I'm just so glad you stood up to the plate.
[02:55:54.359 --> 02:55:55.019]  Made a great film.
[02:55:55.059 --> 02:55:57.522]  Your second edition is even better.
[02:55:57.562 --> 02:55:59.143]  We'll carry it at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:59.463 --> 02:56:01.305]  Thank you so much for defending this country.
[02:56:02.105 --> 02:56:03.427]  Yeah, thanks for having me on your show, Alex.
[02:56:03.447 --> 02:56:05.729]  I've been looking forward to it.
[02:56:05.789 --> 02:56:06.349]  You bet.
[02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:10.012]  And we look forward to having you back on again in the future.
[02:56:10.052 --> 02:56:10.713]  So God bless you.
[02:56:11.323 --> 02:56:11.583]  Yeah.
[02:56:11.683 --> 02:56:12.264]  You too, Alex.
[02:56:12.344 --> 02:56:12.984]  Take care of yourself.
[02:56:13.144 --> 02:56:13.424]  You bet.
[02:56:13.444 --> 02:56:13.744]  Bye-bye.
[02:56:14.245 --> 02:56:14.865]  All right, folks.
[02:56:14.885 --> 02:56:16.286]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:16.326 --> 02:56:18.707]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:19.147 --> 02:56:21.189]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:21.369 --> 02:56:23.970]  God bless you all.
