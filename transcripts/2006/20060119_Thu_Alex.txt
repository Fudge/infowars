[00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:06.435]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.096 --> 00:00:08.156]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:09.977]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.637 --> 00:00:11.438]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:13.119]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.521]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.043]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:44.284]  Well, I'm fired up ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:46.486]  In fact, I've never cooled down.
[00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:49.844]  I was, of course, on Coast to Coast AM last night.
[00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:59.612]  I thought it was an excellent three-hour broadcast that I was able to be involved with with George Norrie in the second biggest radio show in the country.
[00:01:00.173 --> 00:01:01.954]  Always honored to be a part of that.
[00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:06.438]  And we discussed the Cashless Society control and tracking grid.
[00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:13.344]  And I don't think I've ever heard that much information come out in mainstream media in a major venue on the subject of
[00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.510]  So that was very informative.
[00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.954]  And I want to go back over kind of an overview of just how serious this is today.
[00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:22.816]  Spend maybe ten minutes on it.
[00:01:22.856 --> 00:01:30.864]  We also talked about the new infiltration of the Bohemian Grove, the new footage that's in the new documentary, The Order of Death.
[00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:34.487]  And then also Norrie wanted to talk about Iran quite a bit.
[00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.436]  And listen, we need to talk about Iran again today.
[00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:48.904]  So we'll do that throughout the three hours because it's so important and just some huge new developments coming out on that front.
[00:01:49.525 --> 00:01:51.647]  Front by front, I mean pun intended.
[00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:53.088]  We are very close to that.
[00:01:54.111 --> 00:02:04.521]  We have the Professor Castle, who debated John Yoo, one of the White House advisors that wrote memos that Bush could torture children in front of their parents and crush their body parts.
[00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:06.003]  Very sick.
[00:02:06.723 --> 00:02:07.805]  He'll be joining us.
[00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:09.546]  He was there at the university debating Mr. Yoo.
[00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:14.387]  We have that audio clip as well, so we'll be playing it.
[00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:17.551]  That's in the second hour scheduled.
[00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:27.140]  And then in the third hour, Dylan Avery, one of the producers of the amazing 9-11 Doc Loose Change.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.622]  Now there's Loose Change 2.
[00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:46.194]  Even better, much better than the first, and we're carrying it here at Infowars.com, here on Real Talk Radio, real issues of significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:50.236]  I got an email the other day going, you know, I've heard of another show called Real Talk Radio, Alex.
[00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:53.897]  Well, you know, I called the show that six, seven years ago, five years ago.
[00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:56.537]  I even had T-shirts printed up that said I'd wear them about.
[00:02:57.157 --> 00:02:59.238]  And other shows have claimed that mantle.
[00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:03.159]  So I thought, you know, I might as well just use my name since others have tried to do it.
[00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.700]  So it's Real Talk Radio, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.000]  Okay.
[00:03:09.392 --> 00:03:10.372]  Here's some of the news.
[00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:13.694]  Bin Laden warns of attacks, offers truce.
[00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:15.595]  This is total theater.
[00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:18.636]  Now they're claiming the bombing last week in Pakistan.
[00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:19.436]  Big victory.
[00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:30.941]  That's right out of the neocon Republican strategy book where they said we need victories, even if they're fake, or another terror attack to get the people behind our agenda.
[00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:35.544]  And I heard the neocons today on the radio running around foaming at the mouth celebrating over it.
[00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:36.464]  It's just total theater.
[00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:41.308]  Meanwhile, Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.330]  No wonder Americans are so scared.
[00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.331]  Listen to that headline.
[00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:45.993]  Iran nukes.
[00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:49.176]  They don't have what you'd think of as nukes.
[00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:52.299]  They don't have even the materials to make an A-bomb.
[00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.203]  They're ten years away from an A-bomb, the CIA's own reports admit.
[00:03:56.763 --> 00:03:59.186]  Conservatively ten years, if they were left alone.
[00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.468]  And it just doesn't matter.
[00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:02.248]  It doesn't matter.
[00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:10.396]  Everybody thinks we're about to be nuked by the Iranians, and I believe the globalists probably will detonate a weapon and blame it on them so that you can live in a police state.
[00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:14.881]  But it isn't going to be Iranians kicking down your door wearing black masks with MP5 submachine guns.
[00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:17.883]  It isn't going to be the Iranians taking your pension funds.
[00:04:18.164 --> 00:04:21.627]  It isn't going to be Iranians feeding you genetically engineered food that's very bad for you.
[00:04:21.647 --> 00:04:24.450]  It isn't going to be the Iranians trying to force inoculate you.
[00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.350]  But, I mean, you know, it feels good.
[00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.552]  If it feels good to hate the Iranians, even though people that hate them don't even know anything about the country, then c'est la vie, folks.
[00:04:31.612 --> 00:04:32.532]  Just c'est la vie.
[00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:40.815]  And they want to compromise, but the world says, no way, we're going to come in there and you're going to die!
[00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:42.975]  We're going to take your oil.
[00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:46.996]  You're going to give it to us, boy.
[00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:52.238]  So, we'll come back and get into all of this.
[00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:56.899]  And Bush administration wants all of your Google search records.
[00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.662]  But it's for the children.
[00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:05.526]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.787 --> 00:05:06.487]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.587 --> 00:05:07.368]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:12.392]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:19.459]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:20.540]  We're good to go.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.120]  We're good to go.
[00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.281]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:02.874]  Hello, folks.

[00:07:02.057 --> 00:07:06.701]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:07.481]  have diabetes.
[00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:14.747]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:19.431]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:22.453]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:08:06.122 --> 00:08:06.762]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:08.483]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:10.404]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.944 --> 00:08:11.805]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:13.365]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:17.748]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:22.370]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:37.624]  Just in the last few hours, there are global reports coming out.
[00:08:37.664 --> 00:08:40.326]  I have one here from the Associated Press, Reuters, you name it.
[00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:46.031]  That Osama bin Laden warns of new attacks, but he offers a truce.
[00:08:48.306 --> 00:08:53.228]  And I might as well say the Sandman threatens more attacks and offers a truce.
[00:08:53.268 --> 00:08:58.429]  Or maybe Rumble Stillskin warns of attacks but offers a truce.
[00:08:58.569 --> 00:09:02.170]  Or perhaps I should say a false of doom.
[00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.191]  He doesn't really exist outside of...
[00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:13.915]  Robert E. Howard, Conan the Barbarian books, but perhaps Thulse of Doom is threatening us, and he's going to get us any minute.
[00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:25.805]  Of course, just like a jack-in-the-box, bin Laden pops out to scare us right on the eve of airstrikes on Iran that could come any day or any month or any year now.
[00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:28.547]  You don't know when they're going to strike, but it looks like sooner than later.
[00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:31.270]  And right out of the box comes some of bin Laden, you know,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.924]  Three and a half years ago, they tried the fat man.
[00:09:34.944 --> 00:09:40.493]  It was a fat guy with a nose about twice the size of Bin Laden's, looked absolutely nothing like him.
[00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:47.544]  And the CIA said, it's off the neck, and Bin Laden's going to kill us all.
[00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:53.729]  And then over and over again, they will re-air old Bin Laden tapes, re-edited.
[00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:57.793]  Everyone knows it's the same cave from four-plus years ago.
[00:09:58.073 --> 00:10:05.759]  And then a day later, there'll be a little retraction, just a small little, oh, that was an old re-edited tape, but the general public saw it as Bin Laden is back.
[00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:12.123]  They did a voice print analysis of the fat Bin Laden, and...
[00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:16.923]  It was not bin Laden, because you can have 100% voice print.
[00:10:16.943 --> 00:10:27.529]  You can take the real voice of bin Laden from interviews and tapes and make a code key to open a pass lock on a voice recognition software system.
[00:10:28.049 --> 00:10:36.694]  And then you take the voice of the fat bin Laden, and of course the CIA turned down the lights so it would be a little bit blurry and all the rest of it, but
[00:10:37.514 --> 00:10:40.477]  The French, a major university in Canada, U.S.
[00:10:40.517 --> 00:10:53.468]  researchers, they all took the voice and tested it, and it wasn't even near the biometric access code of the voice pattern of Osama bin Bush, bin Laden, al-Qaeda.
[00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:55.690]  It wasn't even near it.
[00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:57.632]  And then linguists...
[00:10:58.688 --> 00:11:01.170]  Listen to it and listen to the voice patterns.
[00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:10.676]  It was a Westerner trying to pose with a Middle Eastern accent.
[00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:12.597]  Sod accent.
[00:11:13.818 --> 00:11:22.123]  And you can go read all the mainstream news articles about that, but again, those are the news articles that are in a few newspapers and are maybe on a few news wires, but never make the big nightly news.
[00:11:23.212 --> 00:11:31.995]  But, of course, last week they said that over the weekend they had killed the number two Al-Qaeda man, Ford bin Laden.
[00:11:32.755 --> 00:11:34.156]  And, folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:11:34.236 --> 00:11:35.797]  I quit counting it ten times.
[00:11:36.697 --> 00:11:39.438]  And, of course, most of the talk show hosts mixed up the two.
[00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:42.639]  The supposed Iraqi commander of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.320]  Talk about a handle that the Western media created.
[00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:52.433]  And then there's his supposed doctor and his number two man, and different talk show hosts are saying when he was killed.
[00:11:52.453 --> 00:11:53.614]  They don't even know the names.
[00:11:54.134 --> 00:11:55.055]  It's hard to pronounce them.
[00:11:55.095 --> 00:11:55.775]  I don't blame them.
[00:11:56.776 --> 00:11:58.116]  And both guys have been killed.
[00:11:58.997 --> 00:12:00.638]  Well, I mean, they're killed on a monthly basis.
[00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:08.323]  And the neocon documents, one of their little memos going around Washington, the Republican circle says, we need a terrorist attack.
[00:12:08.363 --> 00:12:09.824]  The people aren't buying our agenda.
[00:12:10.044 --> 00:12:13.846]  We're all getting in trouble for corruption and bid rigging and war profiteering.
[00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.047]  We've got to do something.
[00:12:16.624 --> 00:12:17.144]  We're good to go.
[00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:17.584]  I think?
[00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:41.666]  Just absolutely no connection, and it's extremely frustrating for me.
[00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:42.367]  I mean, listen to this.
[00:12:42.807 --> 00:12:45.830]  Bin Laden warns of attacks, offers truce.
[00:12:46.531 --> 00:13:00.303]  Al Jazeera on Tuesday broadcast portions of an audio tape, purportedly from Osama Bin Laden, saying Al Qaeda is making preparations for attacks in the United States, but offering a possible truce to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:13:01.704 --> 00:13:08.770]  The voice on the tape said, Hyphen Security United States is not the reason there have been no attacks since September 11, suicide hijackings.
[00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.193]  Instead, the reason is because there are operations that needed preparations, he said.
[00:13:13.213 --> 00:13:15.215]  Okay, let's just stop right there.
[00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:18.638]  Number one, I'm sure that Al Jazeera is a front.
[00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:22.661]  And by the way, in major polls in the Middle East, most Arabs think that.
[00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:22.901]  Why?
[00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:23.882]  Because they're not stupid.
[00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:30.974]  There are things like Al Arabia and a whole bunch of other channels that are 50 times more hardcore.
[00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:34.875]  I mean, just better reports, more information.
[00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:51.899]  I mean, look, when the British government makes Al Jazeera a major channel and is supporting it and the Queen of England is giving interviews to it and David Frost, the little Royal Institute of International Affairs front man, goes to be their host and their anchor, you know there's a problem.
[00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:57.411]  They've got to be able to talk to the billion Muslims and convince them to be good little slaves.
[00:13:57.451 --> 00:13:59.713]  So they have to build credibility for Al Jazeera.
[00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:05.018]  And there's literally a hundred different points that prove this without a shadow of a doubt that they're fronts.
[00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:11.003]  But one of the big ones is Bush wanting to bomb them and then that gets released by...
[00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:16.390]  Blair Cabinet officials and, oh, Bush is an idiot and Tony Blair had to talk him down.
[00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.532]  Folks, if you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:23.975]  I've got some swamp land on Mars that's really a good price for you.
[00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:28.838]  Just send the check and I'll sign over the deed to Martian Landscape to you.
[00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:32.943]  This is how they have to create a false choice.
[00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:44.397]  It's like Bill Clinton and George Bush vacationing together and having 11 meetings right before the election, before Clinton even ran back in 1991 and Clinton going to Bilderberg Group.
[00:14:45.157 --> 00:14:48.602]  And then he's a known intelligence asset right out of high school.
[00:14:50.897 --> 00:14:59.159]  Royal Institute of International Affairs, CFR, he went to their Rhodes Scholarship, which is total British intelligence.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.241]  I mean, the Rhodes Scholarship is the prototype of MI5, MI6.
[00:15:04.301 --> 00:15:05.721]  I mean, that's what it is.
[00:15:06.581 --> 00:15:08.842]  I mean, it is to expand the British Empire.
[00:15:09.697 --> 00:15:11.578]  And then now people never could believe me on that one.
[00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:15.840]  I interviewed the CIA agents who were there watching the cocaine be unloaded for years.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.461]  Bill Clinton pulling up and overseeing operations.
[00:15:18.841 --> 00:15:21.202]  Excellent job, man!
[00:15:21.302 --> 00:15:22.503]  Bush flying in.
[00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:24.884]  I mean, it's a joke, people.
[00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:29.506]  We're talking about trillions and trillions of dollars in this economy being looted.
[00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:32.807]  They don't leave it up to real debates and
[00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:34.889]  And real presidential elections.
[00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:37.590]  Since Kennedy, we haven't had a real president.
[00:15:37.951 --> 00:15:41.073]  And most of them before that, since Lincoln, weren't real.
[00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:43.655]  And that's just on the record.
[00:15:44.796 --> 00:16:00.087]  I mean, Kennedy, a month before he was killed, at a major university, you can go read these transcripts out there, said, a secret government's in control, it's totally evil, I'm going to abolish the CIA and the Federal Reserve, and he signed the executive orders to do it, and had our troops on the way back from...
[00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:03.875]  From Vietnam when they blew his hat off in Dallas.
[00:16:07.698 --> 00:16:11.562]  So it's the same crew, it's the same crowd, and it's totally staged.
[00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:15.445]  And until we hear that Ahmad Chalabi...
[00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:31.891]  We hear that he's a convicted bank robber, and he was an Iranian torture master, and he's all these things, but oh, he's the good guy, and then he's the bad guy, and he's giving stuff to Iran, and then he flies to the U.S.
[00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:32.931]  to New York, meets with Cheney.
[00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:34.331]  Now he's the good guy.
[00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:39.012]  They put him in charge of the Iraqi oil program.
[00:16:39.032 --> 00:16:43.693]  I mean, a known convicted crook by our allies.
[00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:49.388]  A known torture master and convicted crook in Jordan runs the oil program.
[00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:53.291]  And they admit that there are tens of millions of dollars every month just missing.
[00:16:54.331 --> 00:16:55.852]  And, again, no one gets in trouble.
[00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:57.293]  Just mass looting.
[00:16:57.774 --> 00:17:01.156]  And then, meanwhile, I'm driving into the office this morning, and I hear neocons on the radio.
[00:17:01.196 --> 00:17:02.857]  I flip through channels, knowing we're not here.
[00:17:03.237 --> 00:17:07.240]  And they were literally celebrating, going, this is a great victory.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.481]  He's offering cruises.
[00:17:08.821 --> 00:17:10.582]  It means we've got him on the ropes.
[00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:16.824]  And scum like Cindy Sheehan, they don't want to, you know, she wants to give them aid.
[00:17:16.865 --> 00:17:18.285]  We got to move in quick now.
[00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:19.165]  We got them.
[00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.646]  We got them on the run.
[00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:21.967]  We got them on the ropes.
[00:17:22.507 --> 00:17:30.150]  Just as the RNC memo says, you know, claim they're on the ropes, have Bin Laden say they're losing, claim that we've killed Bin Laden.
[00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.170]  It's just theater.
[00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:36.636]  I heard that one neocon go, and I think we killed his number two man.
[00:17:36.656 --> 00:17:39.579]  And I heard that neocon a month ago say they killed the number two man.
[00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:44.082]  And that particular neocon that's on here locally, it's a national show, he's not stupid.
[00:17:44.122 --> 00:17:45.383]  He knows it's all staged.
[00:17:46.263 --> 00:17:47.724]  I mean, do you like this, folks?
[00:17:47.964 --> 00:17:51.327]  I mean, look, the government told you that it was all free news and free media.
[00:17:51.367 --> 00:17:52.448]  That was a sign of the freedom.
[00:17:52.708 --> 00:17:55.310]  Turns out there's not one free newspaper in Iraq.
[00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:01.194]  But our government will go in and kill you immediately if you don't write exactly what they want.
[00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:03.380]  It's all staged.
[00:18:04.781 --> 00:18:15.910]  And I've got articles right here where respected editors, secular editors over there, are given 30 years by the puppet government if they write an editorial criticizing the occupation.
[00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:17.071]  Oh, man, that's freedom.
[00:18:17.292 --> 00:18:26.940]  And then don't go, well, this is a war, Alex, and we've got to... Wait a minute, I thought you... But the other day you were saying that it's freedom, and look at the beautiful free press they've got.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.661]  And don't you understand, that fake press is used here domestically.
[00:18:30.681 --> 00:18:41.707]  The Pentagon admits, with the Pentagon Office of Strategic Information, the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence, excuse me, that they are openly planting fake news stories.
[00:18:42.007 --> 00:18:43.407]  Folks, that is not freedom!
[00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.289]  I mean, this is mind-blowing.
[00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:51.211]  I mean, here's an example of just wordsmithing and total manipulation.
[00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:55.053]  World Net Daily, and you can find these everywhere else in every other major publication.
[00:18:56.386 --> 00:19:00.969]  Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.912]  Air Force has workable war plan with high probability of success.
[00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:09.655]  What, blowing up a peaceful uranium enrichment center?
[00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:13.970]  Which you can't even make A-bombs with?
[00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:14.851]  Even A-bombs?
[00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:16.152]  Primitive A-bombs?
[00:19:16.192 --> 00:19:17.052]  I mean, that's just 101.
[00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:22.455]  It's what all the nuclear physicists and nuclear engineers are saying.
[00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:23.075]  You can't do it.
[00:19:23.115 --> 00:19:25.997]  You can't make a ham sandwich without ham and bread.
[00:19:26.897 --> 00:19:28.898]  There's no ham, there's no bread, you can't make it.
[00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.059]  You understand?
[00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:31.219]  It's just a total lie.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.541]  But the average person hears this.
[00:19:35.201 --> 00:19:40.064]  Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:43.656]  Israel's nuke?
[00:19:44.136 --> 00:19:45.696]  Iran nukes, nukes, nukes.
[00:19:45.737 --> 00:19:47.097]  They took the seal off the nukes.
[00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:50.859]  Sounds like a movie with Harrison Ford.
[00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:52.219]  They're taking the seal off the nukes.
[00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:52.960]  They're going to detonate it.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.101]  People go, nukes, they've got them.
[00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:57.282]  There are no nukes.
[00:19:57.982 --> 00:19:59.423]  But they just say nukes.
[00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:04.979]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:09.221]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:12.262]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:14.843]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:15.043 --> 00:20:23.686]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:23.886 --> 00:20:25.226]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:20:25.407 --> 00:20:29.548]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:30.229]  We're good to go.
[00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:49.910]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.403 --> 00:21:01.863]  Gold.
[00:21:02.204 --> 00:21:03.484]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:09.829]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:13.831]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:16.073]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:18.414]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.554 --> 00:21:24.138]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[00:21:24.158 --> 00:21:24.798]  We're good to go.
[00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:44.528]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[00:22:08.556 --> 00:22:09.337]  I'm Tex Mars.
[00:22:09.757 --> 00:22:13.961]  My newest book, Codex Magica, is a real eye-opener.
[00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:17.544]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[00:22:18.084 --> 00:22:26.932]  Codex Magica shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act!
[00:22:27.532 --> 00:22:31.178]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati.
[00:22:31.439 --> 00:22:32.861]  Their mysterious symbols.
[00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:34.724]  Their hidden language.
[00:22:35.365 --> 00:22:36.247]  Encyclopedic.
[00:22:36.827 --> 00:22:37.428]  Documented.
[00:22:37.709 --> 00:22:41.796]  Codex Magica unmasked a conspiracy of immense evil.
[00:22:42.577 --> 00:22:51.707]  Please, order your personal copy of Codex Magica on the internet at powerofprophecy.com or simply phone toll-free 1-800-234-9673.
[00:22:51.727 --> 00:22:51.947]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:04.670]  Thanks for tuning in to this edition of Coffee on the Air.
[00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.272]  I'm your host, Joe Java.
[00:23:06.412 --> 00:23:09.054]  Today we're talking about guilt-free healthy coffee.
[00:23:09.334 --> 00:23:11.976]  Yes, it is possible to enjoy healthy coffee.
[00:23:12.237 --> 00:23:14.779]  And on today's episode, we're going to tell you how.
[00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:16.060]  More after this break.
[00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:20.733]  Time to wake up and start your day on a healthy note with Gano Coffee.
[00:23:20.853 --> 00:23:31.678]  What makes Gano Coffee so special is the addition of high-quality Ganoderma from the amazingly nutritious red reishi mushroom that provides energy and helps expel toxins from the body.
[00:23:31.898 --> 00:23:33.759]  For your coffee sample, call toll-free 866-271-3653.
[00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:39.183]  Welcome back to Coffee on the Air.
[00:23:39.403 --> 00:23:42.706]  I'm Joe Java with news that you can enjoy guilt-free coffee.
[00:23:42.806 --> 00:23:50.032]  Just visit our website, coffeeontheair.com, or call us directly at 866-271-3653.
[00:23:50.412 --> 00:23:59.600]  Stay tuned for the next episode of Coffee on the Air, when we discuss how agano coffee can boost your immune system and can actually help you get a good night's sleep.
[00:24:05.596 --> 00:24:15.514]  We've got Dylan Avery, one of the producers and the director of the Loose Change 2 9-11 documentary that we're carrying on Infowars.com, joining us in the third hour.
[00:24:15.554 --> 00:24:17.678]  Coming up next hour, we've got Professor Castle.
[00:24:18.573 --> 00:24:25.696]  Coming on to talk about John Yoo, one of Bush's top advisors, saying Bush can torture small children in front of their parents.
[00:24:26.036 --> 00:24:32.638]  Oh, by the way, Scott, don't forget to find that clip that we played last week of their exchange so we can play that on air.
[00:24:32.658 --> 00:24:35.299]  Just giving you a heads up to dig that out of the computer.
[00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:37.660]  It's probably got, I have no idea how many clips in it.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.682]  But on this whole Iran situation, Iran's new confidants,
[00:24:44.648 --> 00:24:46.750]  You know, they're just got to be nuked.
[00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.971]  They're evil because they've got nukes.
[00:24:49.211 --> 00:25:02.581]  And Rumsfeld and others have said they don't rule out using tactical weapons, tactical thermal nuclear weapons, to, quote, knock out these deep bunkers, these facilities.
[00:25:03.274 --> 00:25:05.916]  And understand, there have been UN inspectors in all of them.
[00:25:05.956 --> 00:25:07.977]  They have video cameras in them.
[00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:16.303]  And all of the experts that run laboratories and plants and have made weapons for this country and other countries go, what do you mean?
[00:25:16.343 --> 00:25:17.804]  You can't make anything with that.
[00:25:18.396 --> 00:25:19.177]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:25:19.197 --> 00:25:29.124]  They've got a steady stream of government agents and operatives to go on TV and Christina Amanpour to misquote the Iranian president.
[00:25:29.164 --> 00:25:34.409]  Listen, last night I was on Coast to Coast AM and a couple of callers called in and go, well, he just threatened to nuke Israel.
[00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:36.410]  Well, what do we do?
[00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:42.755]  Alex, I agree with you on a lot of stuff, but a man called in and said that, a lady called in and said that of the calls he took.
[00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:46.338]  I mean, again, people don't hear the retraction.
[00:25:46.934 --> 00:25:49.296]  That's why Christina Amanpour did that.
[00:25:49.636 --> 00:25:51.298]  And they always do that.
[00:25:51.318 --> 00:26:05.290]  You understand CNN with ITN and others, back in the mid-90s, went and showed one starving guy up at a fence who had a disease trying to break into the food pantry at an aid station.
[00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.251]  They had barbed wire around it.
[00:26:06.491 --> 00:26:08.393]  And they said he was inside a camp.
[00:26:09.294 --> 00:26:10.054]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:26:10.074 --> 00:26:12.156]  Do we like being conned like this?
[00:26:12.877 --> 00:26:13.998]  Does it feel good?
[00:26:15.323 --> 00:26:22.025]  I know you're going to have debates around the water cooler or out there on the job site with people that are like, he said he'd nuke Israel!
[00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:23.365]  He said it!
[00:26:23.645 --> 00:26:25.025]  What, are you against Israel?
[00:26:28.246 --> 00:26:29.366]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:26:29.406 --> 00:26:30.386]  He did not say that.
[00:26:30.466 --> 00:26:34.187]  Most of the things you hear the Iranian president has said is not true.
[00:26:35.187 --> 00:26:37.328]  And I'm not even defending the Iranian president.
[00:26:37.808 --> 00:26:41.049]  Last night I kept trying to explain my position on Iran.
[00:26:41.089 --> 00:26:42.289]  I'm like, the top...
[00:26:43.445 --> 00:26:48.131]  Chinese General, on record, last year, late last year, remember?
[00:26:48.492 --> 00:26:54.279]  He called together over 100 top reporters, said there's going to be a press conference in one week.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.146]  Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, CNN, Time Magazine, they're all there.
[00:26:59.878 --> 00:27:17.209]  And he says, if you get involved in Taiwan, you get involved in any of our possessions, any of our national interest, anywhere in the world, we are targeting 200 of your cities, and we will preemptively, that is with no provocation, without telling you, hit you first.
[00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:21.077]  And kill half of your population.
[00:27:21.237 --> 00:27:26.320]  By the way, 90% of the American people live in cities, and 200 cities.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.582]  I mean, when you get up in the 150s, you're looking at little bitty towns.
[00:27:30.702 --> 00:27:37.886]  I mean, we're only 300 million people now, with the projections with the new midterm census coming up.
[00:27:39.106 --> 00:27:40.827]  In fact, we just crossed the 300 million mark.
[00:27:40.847 --> 00:27:43.308]  It's really higher than that with all the illegal aliens.
[00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.729]  I'd say 320 million, but who's counting?
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.142]  We're only 300 million people, and you hit 200 cities.
[00:27:50.323 --> 00:27:51.724]  He said we'll kill half of you.
[00:27:51.744 --> 00:27:52.884]  That's a lot more than half.
[00:27:52.984 --> 00:27:55.186]  I would imagine that more than half would die.
[00:27:55.226 --> 00:27:59.148]  And then he said, we are a billion, 350 plus million.
[00:27:59.188 --> 00:28:00.709]  We want a war with you.
[00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:05.332]  He's the head of their military, number three in the entire government.
[00:28:07.398 --> 00:28:10.300]  And I brought it up last night and people were like, Alex, it doesn't matter.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.121]  Man, that Iranian president, he's just scary.
[00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:14.202]  Yeah, but he won't.
[00:28:14.362 --> 00:28:15.402]  He doesn't have A-bombs.
[00:28:15.442 --> 00:28:16.283]  He can't have them.
[00:28:16.543 --> 00:28:18.364]  This is all just hype and hysteria.
[00:28:19.004 --> 00:28:20.985]  But everybody shares the word, Iran's nukes.
[00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:24.247]  Israel's new confidence in attack on Iran nukes.
[00:28:24.807 --> 00:28:28.910]  Then you read it's peaceful enrichment for reactors.
[00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:34.733]  You know, the University of Texas has actually, I've been wrong the last few years, I keep saying one reactor, they have two reactors.
[00:28:35.093 --> 00:28:36.734]  And a lot of big universities have reactors.
[00:28:37.614 --> 00:28:38.915]  We'll have them right in your neighborhood.
[00:28:38.935 --> 00:28:39.816]  You'll never even know they're there.
[00:28:40.117 --> 00:28:41.959]  Up off Parmer, North Austin, or downtown.
[00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:43.761]  You know, nuclear reactors, no big deal.
[00:28:44.742 --> 00:28:45.863]  Nobody guarding them, nothing.
[00:28:45.883 --> 00:28:46.724]  You just drive in there.
[00:28:46.764 --> 00:28:48.345]  Do whatever you want.
[00:28:48.385 --> 00:28:48.846]  No problem.
[00:28:49.326 --> 00:28:49.747]  Seriously.
[00:28:50.448 --> 00:28:52.570]  But to make a long story short...
[00:28:54.073 --> 00:29:09.496]  If a university wants this stuff enriched that Iran's not even allowed to enrich to have something peaceful that you can't use for weapons, different isotopes, different animal folks, it's like you ride a horse, you don't ride a, say, Boston Terrier.
[00:29:09.516 --> 00:29:10.197]  It'd break its back.
[00:29:10.217 --> 00:29:11.957]  See, you can't do that with it.
[00:29:12.257 --> 00:29:12.997]  It's not a horse.
[00:29:13.057 --> 00:29:16.318]  It's like weapons-grade plutonium or uranium is a horse.
[00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:22.203]  And this is like saying that Iran is going to be able to make an A-bomb, you know, ride a mouse.
[00:29:22.483 --> 00:29:23.203]  Forget a dog.
[00:29:23.243 --> 00:29:26.066]  It's like saying they can mount a mouse and ride it to town.
[00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:31.010]  But see, what a university can just call up and, hey, send over some of that.
[00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.151]  I'm going to have a reactor.
[00:29:32.451 --> 00:29:34.072]  Sure, we'll deliver it next week.
[00:29:34.413 --> 00:29:35.413]  Sign a few forms.
[00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:36.654]  No big deal.
[00:29:37.455 --> 00:29:40.958]  Iran isn't even allowed to have.
[00:29:40.998 --> 00:29:42.199]  That's global government, folks.
[00:29:42.639 --> 00:29:44.601]  This is all a big lesson in global government.
[00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:47.595]  More than anything, that's what this is about, about hearing how the U.N.
[00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:48.156]  is the boss.
[00:29:48.437 --> 00:29:49.999]  Everyone's got to go to the U.N.
[00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:51.261]  and see what they say.
[00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:52.824]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.305 --> 00:29:54.908]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.928 --> 00:29:58.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:07.783]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.923 --> 00:31:14.086]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.387 --> 00:31:22.812]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.052 --> 00:31:30.076]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.376 --> 00:31:35.199]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.419 --> 00:31:40.823]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.163 --> 00:31:44.245]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:52.551]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:01.458 --> 00:32:04.762]  We're good to go.
[00:32:12.737 --> 00:32:21.102]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[00:32:21.762 --> 00:32:29.207]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[00:32:29.707 --> 00:32:31.488]  This is real, not science fiction.
[00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:40.814]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X.com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:52.936]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex Technology products that assist in so many areas, such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[00:32:53.457 --> 00:32:57.359]  TriVortex Technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[00:33:06.497 --> 00:33:08.422]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.903 --> 00:33:11.649]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:24.612]  John, Stan, Mark, Paula, many others.
[00:33:25.073 --> 00:33:25.953]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:33:26.033 --> 00:33:31.555]  It's always a good idea to give the phone number out.
[00:33:31.575 --> 00:33:32.235]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:32.255 --> 00:33:32.455]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:32.536 --> 00:33:36.037]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:33:36.317 --> 00:33:42.099]  We do have the professor coming on that debated John Yoo, a literal pig demon.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.880]  And so that is coming up.
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.841]  And I just can't think of a better term for them than pig demons.
[00:33:47.921 --> 00:33:49.242]  I mean, just they're pig-like demons.
[00:33:49.958 --> 00:33:52.379]  Talking about torturing children and snickering about it.
[00:33:52.439 --> 00:33:53.619]  It's just sickos.
[00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:57.921]  Jeffrey Dahmer-type mindsets being openly promoted as if it's good.
[00:33:57.961 --> 00:34:00.482]  I mean, folks, they're really trying to warp our brains right now.
[00:34:00.502 --> 00:34:01.783]  This is all being scientifically done.
[00:34:02.183 --> 00:34:02.803]  That's coming up.
[00:34:03.843 --> 00:34:07.905]  But I want to just briefly get into some of the other news here.
[00:34:09.245 --> 00:34:11.846]  Some of the other news that is developing.
[00:34:11.966 --> 00:34:12.247]  U.S.
[00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:14.888]  openly tortures suspects, says report.
[00:34:14.908 --> 00:34:16.348]  Associated Press.
[00:34:17.048 --> 00:34:18.549]  The gauntlet's just been thrown down.
[00:34:20.211 --> 00:34:20.531]  Look at this.
[00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:22.352]  I see articles like this every day.
[00:34:22.932 --> 00:34:24.933]  They're recasting Big Brother.
[00:34:25.553 --> 00:34:26.293]  He's good.
[00:34:30.214 --> 00:34:30.935]  He's helpful.
[00:34:31.855 --> 00:34:32.575]  He's friendly.
[00:34:33.335 --> 00:34:34.296]  He's a good guy.
[00:34:35.056 --> 00:34:38.997]  A friendly Big Brother could offer a helping hand.
[00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:41.298]  That's an article out of the Irish Times.
[00:34:43.288 --> 00:34:49.276]  Federal grants bring surveillance cameras to small towns, Washington Post, everywhere.
[00:34:49.557 --> 00:34:56.046]  The face scanning, license plate reading cameras are going in, federally, financially, Defense Department programs.
[00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:58.325]  Here's another one.
[00:34:58.425 --> 00:34:59.146]  Official U.S.
[00:34:59.246 --> 00:35:04.928]  agency paints dire picture of out-of-control Iraq, London Guardian plunging into civil war.
[00:35:04.968 --> 00:35:07.789]  Well, that was what they wanted to do from the start.
[00:35:08.129 --> 00:35:12.170]  Extent of soldiers' injuries in Iraq hidden by Ministry of Defense.
[00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:15.712]  Iranian president cements Syrian alliance.
[00:35:15.812 --> 00:35:21.194]  And, of course, on top of all that, Bush administration wants Google search records, records sought in U.S.
[00:35:21.274 --> 00:35:23.835]  quest to revive porn law.
[00:35:23.915 --> 00:35:24.615]  Now, listen.
[00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:37.870]  The law has already been struck down that websites have no responsibility to keep teenagers or children from accessing porn on the internet.
[00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:48.080]  And as out of control as it is on the web, I don't like being sent emails that say your mortgage numbers or, hi, it's your mother, and you click on it and it's a woman with a horse.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.023]  I mean, we've all been on the internet and run into that.
[00:35:51.873 --> 00:35:56.039]  But, you know, that could all be dealt with through ISPs.
[00:35:56.139 --> 00:35:58.722]  If you actually complain and do something, people will get shut down.
[00:35:58.962 --> 00:35:59.883]  But nobody does that.
[00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:06.652]  Instead, the government, I'm going to talk about this later more, prances around, and meanwhile, this is the same Pentagon...
[00:36:08.536 --> 00:36:19.200]  This is the same White House where we have congressional hearings where they admit hundreds of thousands of kidnapped women and children into sex slavery and physical slavery, work camp slavery, public.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.442]  Chicago Tribune, MSNBC, Associated Press just three weeks ago.
[00:36:23.462 --> 00:36:24.262]  Remember all those articles?
[00:36:25.578 --> 00:36:27.219]  And it's just, ah, so what?
[00:36:27.279 --> 00:36:28.480]  Who cares where the kids are?
[00:36:28.721 --> 00:36:29.441]  I mean, just public.
[00:36:29.801 --> 00:36:32.704]  Public, massive, twilight zone level, totally insane.
[00:36:33.504 --> 00:36:53.981]  And meanwhile, uh-oh, we've got to have all the search records of Google, of everyone, without a warrant, just set the precedent when the law they're talking about has been struck down by the Supreme Court to make sure and to get some statistics about if you're searching for random other issues, like you...
[00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:55.121]  We're good to go.
[00:36:55.161 --> 00:36:55.601]  I think?
[00:37:24.048 --> 00:37:31.790]  That my children are going to have computers unattended until they are at least partway through high school.
[00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:40.672]  And I don't care if you see 10-year-olds on the street with their own personal handheld Palm Pilots surfing to their heart's content.
[00:37:41.012 --> 00:37:46.493]  Listen, my children aren't going to be getting cars until they're a little bit older or until they've proven they can drive safely.
[00:37:46.793 --> 00:37:49.414]  I have no idea why I was allowed to have a car at 16.
[00:37:49.574 --> 00:37:51.074]  I mean, I was a danger.
[00:37:53.293 --> 00:37:55.375]  It's just you've got to gauge the child's responsibility.
[00:37:55.395 --> 00:37:56.075]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:57.476 --> 00:38:02.680]  Or the other answer is have them driving tractors when they're 10 and driving work trucks on a ranch.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.642]  That's how we used to grow up, and they'll have responsibility by the time they're 16.
[00:38:06.062 --> 00:38:07.623]  But don't just side issue.
[00:38:07.643 --> 00:38:11.846]  The point is, folks, again, I'm just going to cover this down.
[00:38:11.866 --> 00:38:15.309]  We've got Debbie Morrow on hold for about five minutes with her, but let me just talk about this Google thing right now.
[00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.530]  Because this is so amazing.
[00:38:19.311 --> 00:38:21.552]  Bush has Arnold Specter.
[00:38:21.652 --> 00:38:24.292]  Bush has his chief counsels.
[00:38:25.673 --> 00:38:29.134]  He has his advisors all saying Bush is above the law.
[00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:30.615]  Bush can order torture of children.
[00:38:31.595 --> 00:38:32.335]  Think how sick that is.
[00:38:32.355 --> 00:38:38.757]  We can torture children in front of their parents, but we want to have all your search records to keep kids safe when it doesn't even do anything.
[00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:46.100]  They say just so they know data-wise, so they can get search engines in trouble if they're directing people wrong, which they don't do.
[00:38:49.506 --> 00:38:54.332]  This is just federal control into everything you've searched, everything you're doing.
[00:38:54.352 --> 00:38:55.553]  And let me just give you a news flash.
[00:38:55.954 --> 00:38:57.215]  They've already got all that.
[00:38:57.256 --> 00:39:04.985]  They've got hubs built into all the telecommunications grids at 96 by federal law, upwards of $10 billion of them.
[00:39:05.993 --> 00:39:08.895]  Part of that law was that every cell phone be satellite tracked by October 1, 2001.
[00:39:09.136 --> 00:39:11.017]  They passed it in 1996.
[00:39:11.958 --> 00:39:13.419]  That was five years before.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.001]  And then now all your cell phones are tracking you.
[00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:19.284]  Just try calling up with your cell phone and going, hey, tell me where I'm at.
[00:39:19.885 --> 00:39:23.768]  And if you've got it on your service, the government can already do it, but only some services let you do it.
[00:39:24.048 --> 00:39:26.070]  And they'll tell you the exact where you're at.
[00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.051]  You're at the corner of Washington and Liberty.
[00:39:29.312 --> 00:39:30.713]  You're at the corner of Maine and 24th.
[00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:33.477]  I mean, I was, again, up in Fort Worth.
[00:39:34.078 --> 00:39:37.205]  So number one, number one, they already got all that data.
[00:39:37.425 --> 00:39:37.826]  Okay?
[00:39:37.926 --> 00:39:39.189]  I mean, that's number one.
[00:39:40.522 --> 00:39:42.804]  Number two, all they're doing is announcing it.
[00:39:42.824 --> 00:39:50.709]  They're announcing, we have total power, we can spy on you, it's for your own good, it's to stop Al-Qaeda, it's Bin Laden wants to call America, shouldn't we be able to listen?
[00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:52.590]  They don't even need a warrant for that, folks.
[00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.432]  The FISA isn't even a warrant, it's a rubber stamp.
[00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:55.452]  They didn't even do that.
[00:39:55.993 --> 00:40:02.317]  I've got a big stack here of farmers being watched by NSA satellites, being used by local governments, being tapped into.
[00:40:03.544 --> 00:40:04.625]  War protesters.
[00:40:05.505 --> 00:40:09.847]  Two vegans went and peacefully protested in front of a honey ham shop.
[00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:10.767]  This is mainstream news.
[00:40:12.848 --> 00:40:15.609]  Homeland Security pulled up and said that it was terrorism.
[00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:18.390]  They didn't have a permit to protest on the street corner.
[00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.831]  They weren't even on the business property.
[00:40:20.974 --> 00:40:22.315]  And they arrested them as terrorists.
[00:40:22.515 --> 00:40:26.038]  Folks, that is the Associated Press reporting it like it's normal and dry.
[00:40:26.459 --> 00:40:31.022]  Imagine, you're protesting the honey ham place saying pigs are abused in these little boxes.
[00:40:31.343 --> 00:40:33.264]  Now, again, folks, I'm not an animal rights activist.
[00:40:33.284 --> 00:40:34.085]  I'm not even getting into that.
[00:40:34.125 --> 00:40:36.067]  My point is, they've got a right to do that.
[00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.610]  Folks, I was on George Norrie last night.
[00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:45.194]  I had 127 articles that I physically went through my stacks from the last few weeks because I print everything as a hard copy.
[00:40:46.015 --> 00:40:49.578]  All these mainstream news articles, and I got through about 10 of them, and he said, okay, stop, stop.
[00:40:50.416 --> 00:41:05.905]  And it was just NSA listening to everything, NSA watching reporters, NSA using it for political control, FBI harassing war protesters, harassing gun groups, just military taking photos of citizens all over the country.
[00:41:07.366 --> 00:41:12.929]  Again, but the national debate is about bin Laden calling America, are we allowed to listen?
[00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:16.431]  So, of course we should be able to listen to bin Laden.
[00:41:16.711 --> 00:41:18.472]  What's wrong with you liberals?
[00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:26.342]  So, the new thing is, Bush administration wants Google search records, records sought in U.S.
[00:41:26.402 --> 00:41:30.644]  quest to reign porn law, or revive porn law.
[00:41:32.625 --> 00:41:35.187]  I just, it is so unbelievable, folks.
[00:41:35.947 --> 00:41:37.648]  It is so unbelievable.
[00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:43.632]  And it's just, we want access to everything you're doing, no more warrants, no more nothing.
[00:41:43.832 --> 00:41:49.135]  They're already doing it, they just want to now openly do it so they can start using it.
[00:41:49.853 --> 00:41:51.254]  You see, it's one thing to be doing it.
[00:41:51.394 --> 00:41:54.717]  Now they want to use it on an everyday basis.
[00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:58.260]  Oh, it's unbelievable.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.261]  It is unbelievable.
[00:41:59.321 --> 00:42:00.822]  And this should drive down Google's stock.
[00:42:00.862 --> 00:42:01.823]  Of course it won't.
[00:42:01.843 --> 00:42:03.024]  People should be upset about this.
[00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:06.347]  People should be really demanding.
[00:42:06.707 --> 00:42:15.975]  Google's already worked with China to selectively edit where you can't even do searches in China, in-country, through those web ports and hubs.
[00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.792]  It's just like MySpace with Rupert Murdoch.
[00:42:18.872 --> 00:42:22.877]  Live time, you criticize Rupert Murdoch, you type, nothing will post.
[00:42:23.357 --> 00:42:36.211]  You talk about any of Rupert Murdoch City Corps' holdings, or talk about any other competition, you can't type it on your own supposed blog, because it ain't your own blog.
[00:42:38.007 --> 00:42:46.674]  They came and bought up a 38 million size community, and I've talked to the MySpacers walking around, falling all over themselves, talking about how trendy they are.
[00:42:46.694 --> 00:42:49.216]  I mean, they'll actually walk over to you and go, it's the most trendy thing ever.
[00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:51.037]  I'm like, yeah, man, it's real trendy.
[00:42:51.578 --> 00:42:52.659]  Go somewhere else now.
[00:42:52.759 --> 00:42:53.639]  You know, it's no good.
[00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:58.903]  And they're just like, well, maybe, yeah, he is doing that, but so what?
[00:42:58.923 --> 00:43:02.546]  It's just like, totally trendy, man, totally trendy.
[00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:05.088]  I'm sorry, it was trendy.
[00:43:05.128 --> 00:43:05.789]  It was fun.
[00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:06.369]  It was good.
[00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:06.990]  It ain't now.
[00:43:08.206 --> 00:43:08.647]  Okay?
[00:43:09.707 --> 00:43:12.910]  We have the power by where we go and what we do and what we support.
[00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:16.934]  And so when something starts doing things like this, leave it.
[00:43:16.954 --> 00:43:18.675]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[00:43:18.955 --> 00:43:21.317]  Debbie Morrow, thanks for holding there graciously.
[00:43:21.718 --> 00:43:23.239]  Haven't had you on in a week or so.
[00:43:23.479 --> 00:43:31.106]  And I believe in Made in America products, and I believe in New Millennium Concepts, Made in America, highest quality, gravity-fed filters.
[00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:35.770]  You also are the national distributors, meaning at the lowest price on the British Birkfeld.
[00:43:37.106 --> 00:43:38.888]  And you've got a bunch of deals for us, Debbie.
[00:43:39.729 --> 00:43:46.196]  Yep, I do, and thank you for having me, and I don't mind holding it all because it gives me an opportunity to hear you.
[00:43:46.276 --> 00:43:50.881]  Well, I know you're busy, but just be honest with me, Debbie, because I want your real response.
[00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:51.742]  Okay.
[00:43:51.802 --> 00:43:52.963]  I mean, I really want what you think.
[00:43:53.483 --> 00:43:55.826]  I mean, did any of what I was just saying make sense?
[00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.388]  I mean, do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:43:57.448 --> 00:43:58.609]  I mean, do you see what I'm getting at?
[00:43:59.847 --> 00:44:00.288]  Oh, yeah.
[00:44:00.468 --> 00:44:06.897]  I mean, I wish I could listen more, but absolutely, because it doesn't have anything to do with whether or not you believe in the issues.
[00:44:07.358 --> 00:44:10.622]  It's whether or not we have the right to protest.
[00:44:11.684 --> 00:44:14.948]  You know, I mean, when did we lose the right to be Americans?
[00:44:15.939 --> 00:44:16.339]  We're good to go.
[00:44:33.453 --> 00:44:37.015]  And then they say it's to stop Al-Qaeda, but it has nothing to do with it.
[00:44:37.235 --> 00:44:38.856]  Right.
[00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:45.260]  I mean, I have over 120 articles here just in the last two weeks that I have in a stack here, Debbie.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:52.724]  And none of it has anything to do with the forked-tailed, cloven-hoofed bin Laden.
[00:44:53.204 --> 00:44:53.504]  Right.
[00:44:53.905 --> 00:44:54.965]  Well, and that's what they do.
[00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:59.908]  They say, well, if we do it to bin Laden, we have to be able to do it to everybody.
[00:45:00.413 --> 00:45:06.237]  And that's such nonsense, because if they really wanted to get rid of him, they could get rid of him, you know?
[00:45:06.617 --> 00:45:15.103]  I mean, it's like, you know, they... Well, number three at the CIA said, we don't want to kill him, we don't want to capture him.
[00:45:15.243 --> 00:45:16.524]  Well, yeah, because he works for them.
[00:45:17.564 --> 00:45:18.985]  Debbie, tell us about the specials.
[00:45:19.225 --> 00:45:21.467]  Well, we have the Berkey specials.
[00:45:21.507 --> 00:45:23.708]  We have the big Berkeys.
[00:45:23.808 --> 00:45:29.192]  All the stainless steel models are available with free Berkey sport bottles.
[00:45:29.636 --> 00:45:31.997]  For being an Alex Jones listener.
[00:45:32.017 --> 00:45:38.920]  Or if you get the Royal Berkey, Imperial Berkey, or Crown Berkey, you can get a KDF shower filter instead of sport bottles.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.041]  Or you can make some match.
[00:45:42.081 --> 00:45:43.002]  We can figure it out.
[00:45:43.062 --> 00:45:48.324]  But the main thing is we really want to have good drinking water with the Berkeys.
[00:45:48.384 --> 00:45:52.906]  And I really want to implore people to please call, get your orders in.
[00:45:53.286 --> 00:45:56.547]  Don't wait until there's another disaster in a couple of months.
[00:45:56.867 --> 00:45:58.128]  I mean, things are kind of...
[00:45:58.683 --> 00:46:06.446]  You know, laid back right now, people are lulled into apathy because nothing bad's happening, and so they don't think they need a Berkey.
[00:46:06.907 --> 00:46:11.289]  But you need a Berkey for every single day, not just for an emergency.
[00:46:11.469 --> 00:46:16.591]  Go to the EPA's own website and see the allowable levels.
[00:46:17.655 --> 00:46:18.836]  We're good to go.
[00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:45.095]  Made in America, gravity filters, a new standard, and of course you've got the sports bottles where you get like five of them and they're $20 a piece.
[00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:48.316]  You buy these at the camping store, they're $35 a piece.
[00:46:48.896 --> 00:46:55.178]  You've also got free gifts like sheltering in place DVDs, how to make your house safe from chemical, radiological, biological.
[00:46:55.839 --> 00:46:58.960]  You've got just so much other great stuff, Debbie.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.301]  Folks need to give New Millennium Concepts a call and it's 1-888-
[00:47:04.563 --> 00:47:07.687]  803-4438, 888-803-4438.
[00:47:08.969 --> 00:47:12.414]  The biggest discounts out there when you tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:47:12.454 --> 00:47:16.961]  Not only is it Made in America, the best out there, what I've been using for many years before they were sponsors.
[00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:22.092]  It is, of course, also you get an even bigger discount when you tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:47:22.332 --> 00:47:26.796]  Go to BerkeyWater.com to order off their secure shopping cart.
[00:47:26.836 --> 00:47:28.837]  Tell them in the comments section what free gift you want.
[00:47:28.857 --> 00:47:29.578]  They have those listed.
[00:47:29.958 --> 00:47:34.901]  Or order via the safe, secure shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:35.662 --> 00:47:39.605]  Debbie, I tell you, I just hope people will give you a call.
[00:47:39.725 --> 00:47:43.968]  And this is an area where we can at least take control of this area of our lives.
[00:47:44.568 --> 00:47:45.909]  And water is 70% of the body.
[00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:53.112]  Right, and if you think you're safe because you're on rainwater or well water, you know, don't believe it.
[00:47:53.172 --> 00:48:09.998]  Yesterday when I was driving, you know, they were like doing the sky with the chemtrails, and I literally saw a cloud that had a rainbow in it, and I know that was from the chemtrails, you know, and that oily substance they put in the sky and it gets in the clouds.
[00:48:10.038 --> 00:48:13.779]  Well, in all the factories... If we ever got rain again in Dallas, it'd be a miracle, but...
[00:48:14.804 --> 00:48:19.087]  You know, people think, well, I'm on a well or I'm on rainwater, so I don't need a Berkey.
[00:48:19.147 --> 00:48:29.935]  But if you go ahead and make some ice water, make some ice cubes and water, put it in a clear pitcher and let it melt down, and then take a look at how brown the bottom of your glass is.
[00:48:30.035 --> 00:48:31.376]  Oh, listen, that's what I'm able to do.
[00:48:31.436 --> 00:48:38.221]  Take tap water, put it in an ice tray, and then look at the sediment, then make it with Berkey water, and there's not going to be any sediment.
[00:48:38.481 --> 00:48:40.162]  Debbie, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:48:40.222 --> 00:48:41.023]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:48:41.543 --> 00:48:44.085]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[00:48:44.485 --> 00:48:45.646]  Folks, it's up to you.
[00:48:45.666 --> 00:48:49.669]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.732]  I mean, we're poisoning ourselves with what is in this water.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.083]  888-803-4438 or InfoWars.com.
[00:48:58.103 --> 00:49:02.847]  Go check out the Better Living Through Clean Water section on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:03.367 --> 00:49:08.271]  And as the orders come in same day, we fax them up to Dallas and they ship them out to you or you can get it directly from them.
[00:49:09.152 --> 00:49:11.354]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[00:49:11.394 --> 00:49:11.955]  Thanks for holding.
[00:49:11.995 --> 00:49:12.575]  Go ahead, John.
[00:49:13.156 --> 00:49:13.656]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:49:14.136 --> 00:49:20.702]  I was at my local friendly neighborhood veterans hospital, administration hospital yesterday.
[00:49:21.408 --> 00:49:24.150]  I'm getting my medication with some other buddies of mine.
[00:49:25.971 --> 00:49:39.039]  I was looking through it, through my medication, and my friend was, and we found embossed in some of our pills was a small metallic substance.
[00:49:39.179 --> 00:49:40.500]  We broke it apart and was looking at it.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:47.764]  I think they're RFIDs, like in the medication or something.
[00:49:48.502 --> 00:49:50.023]  I just thought that was interesting.
[00:49:50.183 --> 00:49:56.025]  Actually, Viagra just announced they're going to put chips in the pill bottles.
[00:49:56.565 --> 00:49:59.286]  And there is discussion of putting chips in pills.
[00:49:59.326 --> 00:50:00.466]  You can type that into Google.
[00:50:00.486 --> 00:50:00.987]  You'll find it.
[00:50:01.007 --> 00:50:02.547]  Of course, Bush now wants to know what you're typing in.
[00:50:02.567 --> 00:50:03.647]  It has a chilling effect.
[00:50:03.688 --> 00:50:04.768]  It's meant to scare us, folks.
[00:50:04.948 --> 00:50:05.648]  They should be scared.
[00:50:06.008 --> 00:50:07.549]  We're getting wise to the globalist.
[00:50:08.249 --> 00:50:08.969]  He's just a puppet.
[00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:12.931]  But you ought to... What type of medication is it?
[00:50:13.351 --> 00:50:14.511]  It was a painkiller.
[00:50:15.792 --> 00:50:16.072]  It was a
[00:50:16.431 --> 00:50:17.271]  We're good to go.
[00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:17.871]  We're good to go.
[00:50:40.512 --> 00:50:42.553]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.025 --> 00:51:07.306]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:52:01.474 --> 00:52:08.997]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.257 --> 00:52:22.221]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:25.843]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.183 --> 00:52:36.650]  But it's worth every penny, because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:37.430]  That's right.
[00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:44.715]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.015 --> 00:52:53.766]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.806 --> 00:52:54.267]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[00:54:01.618 --> 00:54:06.539]  Look, I should have gone to clothes earlier.
[00:54:06.639 --> 00:54:09.700]  I want to get to everybody here as quickly as possible.
[00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:14.843]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Tennessee.
[00:54:14.923 --> 00:54:15.984]  John, you're on the air.
[00:54:16.004 --> 00:54:19.447]  Finish up what you were saying, some of the stories over with your friends in Afghanistan.
[00:54:19.867 --> 00:54:36.059]  Yeah, I have some friends who got back from Afghanistan, and while they were over there, told me stories about they wouldn't run into resistance, but all of a sudden they'd get calls over the radio of guys called Pashtun speaking English.
[00:54:36.159 --> 00:54:36.839]  Oh, we know where you are.
[00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:37.420]  We're going to kill you.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:37.980]  We're going to get you.
[00:54:38.841 --> 00:54:40.183]  And just stuff like that.
[00:54:40.203 --> 00:54:45.308]  It seems similar to the Juba sniper stories that's happening to the Marines in Iraq.
[00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:50.694]  And for those that don't know, that is mainstream European news, and it never is on U.S.
[00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:50.895]  news.
[00:54:50.915 --> 00:54:51.956]  They've caught Israelis.
[00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:55.943]  Over and over again, dressed up like Arabs shooting Marines.
[00:54:55.983 --> 00:55:00.107]  The Marines will catch them, beat them up, and they're ordered to release them.
[00:55:00.127 --> 00:55:01.329]  And, you know, they take their clothes off.
[00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:04.592]  They're all Mossad or Shin Bet, big Star of the Davids all over them.
[00:55:05.213 --> 00:55:07.155]  And the same thing is down in Basra.
[00:55:07.195 --> 00:55:07.696]  They caught MI6s.
[00:55:08.977 --> 00:55:17.064]  And I say MI6, the SAS is assigned to them, special air services, dressed up in fake beards, driving around with car bombs, shooting cops, shooting our allies.
[00:55:17.544 --> 00:55:26.011]  It's because the PNAC document, the Israeli document of 83, even before that, says civil war balkanization.
[00:55:26.031 --> 00:55:27.873]  They want a problem to stay there.
[00:55:28.153 --> 00:55:30.615]  So you're saying your buddies who were over there are starting to figure that out?
[00:55:30.955 --> 00:55:36.660]  Yeah, and every time there's an Israeli advisor in their company or platoon,
[00:55:37.475 --> 00:55:37.936]  We're good to go.
[00:55:49.463 --> 00:55:53.485]  Literally, the Israelis are just promulgating more terror, more stuff going on.
[00:55:53.525 --> 00:55:56.027]  It's because the Arabs aren't even fighting, my friend.
[00:55:57.948 --> 00:55:59.068]  There isn't even a war.
[00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:08.734]  Listen, there are real bombings going on and some real killing, but what will happen is our government, or the Israelis and the British, and they've been caught, will carry out a bombing against one group, say, of Shia.
[00:56:09.354 --> 00:56:15.858]  Then they really will go run and attack then some Sunnis, or then they stir it up.
[00:56:16.485 --> 00:56:18.606]  Well, Blackwater doesn't have any Israeli advisors.
[00:56:18.887 --> 00:56:23.950]  And once they kicked them out of their ranks, they haven't had any sneak attacks.
[00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:25.811]  They haven't had as many deaths as the Marines have.
[00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:27.513]  I heard that, yes.
[00:56:27.573 --> 00:56:30.274]  If people have family, write to them.
[00:56:31.215 --> 00:56:33.116]  You don't have to take orders from a foreign nation.
[00:56:33.176 --> 00:56:34.978]  Get the Israelis out of your platoons.
[00:56:35.018 --> 00:56:35.778]  Get them out of your groups.
[00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:39.140]  Well, I mean, it was Israelis predominantly.
[00:56:40.041 --> 00:56:41.162]  This is just the facts, folks.
[00:56:41.202 --> 00:56:45.705]  Taking the photos of the idiots like Grainer in England torturing people.
[00:56:46.528 --> 00:56:47.088]  I mean, why?
[00:56:47.168 --> 00:56:48.909]  Why aren't the people taking the photos in trouble?
[00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:53.191]  Let's start putting two and two together.
[00:56:53.211 --> 00:56:54.291]  See, people don't understand.
[00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:57.232]  Do the globalists make more money if we're there a year or 20?
[00:56:58.953 --> 00:57:00.134]  See, we think we're failing.
[00:57:00.194 --> 00:57:02.454]  No, man, the war on drugs is succeeding.
[00:57:02.494 --> 00:57:05.776]  The more drugs, the more people in prison, the more the police state, it's working.
[00:57:06.116 --> 00:57:08.197]  See, failing is winning for the globalists.
[00:57:08.557 --> 00:57:11.498]  Failing in Iraq, failing in Afghanistan is winning.
[00:57:11.538 --> 00:57:12.639]  People don't understand that.
[00:57:13.959 --> 00:57:16.060]  The troops better start figuring that out.
[00:57:17.845 --> 00:57:23.709]  Are the people you talk to over there, your comrades, are they aware of how bad DU is?
[00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:27.391]  The ones who got back are.
[00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:28.752]  I have a few buddies who are sick.
[00:57:28.792 --> 00:57:34.336]  One of my buddies gave his company commander a 9-11 road to tyranny.
[00:57:34.536 --> 00:57:35.597]  The man sat down and cried.
[00:57:37.438 --> 00:57:39.219]  He wrote me and said, these guys sat down and cried.
[00:57:42.721 --> 00:57:46.324]  Really, I think it's our responsibility as the people back here in the rear to...
[00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.950]  Get the troops out.
[00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.491]  Do something.
[00:57:48.591 --> 00:57:57.094]  We have to... Well, I tell you, crying is the real response of a real man when he realizes murdering terrorists are in control of the government and everything's a complete fraud.
[00:57:57.114 --> 00:57:58.315]  Yeah.
[00:57:58.655 --> 00:58:09.400]  But I tell you, the good news is the people are waking up, and even if the globalists carry off a nuke in this country, that, you know, all the king's horses and all the king's men aren't going to be able to put the New World Order back together again.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.561]  I'm telling you, they've already lost, and they're just starting to figure it out.
[00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:15.042]  They're just starting to figure it out.
[00:58:15.062 --> 00:58:16.683]  A bunch of arrogant trash.
[00:58:17.483 --> 00:58:18.985]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:58:19.005 --> 00:58:19.945]  I appreciate the call.
[00:58:21.307 --> 00:58:22.628]  The facts are the facts.
[00:58:22.688 --> 00:58:25.911]  And find out what's in the... I bet I know what made him cry.
[00:58:26.672 --> 00:58:30.595]  FEMA saying our founding fathers are terrorists, America's bad, and all Christians are terrorists.
[00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:32.257]  Oh yeah, that's what they're teaching.
[00:58:32.657 --> 00:58:35.940]  They're not teaching the police that the Arabs are bad.
[00:58:37.081 --> 00:58:40.505]  They're teaching them that red-blooded Americans are.
[00:58:41.923 --> 00:58:44.864]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:44.904 --> 00:58:45.165]  Big Brother.
[00:58:45.185 --> 00:58:45.985]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:46.005 --> 00:58:46.725]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:46.745 --> 00:58:47.105]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.284 --> 00:59:05.185]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.205 --> 00:59:09.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.027 --> 00:59:14.130]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:17.611]  This is your wartime transmission against the New World Order.
[00:59:18.192 --> 00:59:22.574]  We are the organic, natural response to the tyrants.
[00:59:23.555 --> 00:59:31.939]  We are engaging in special warfare with the truth at point-blank range at the local level across the country, defending this country, exposing the terrorists.
[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:32.960]  We are...
[00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:38.314]  In a figure of speech, swinging our muskets, ladies and gentlemen, against the enemy.
[00:59:38.354 --> 00:59:39.935]  We are at point-blank range.
[00:59:40.055 --> 00:59:41.176]  Join us in the fight.
[00:59:41.196 --> 00:59:42.797]  There is plenty to go around.
[00:59:42.897 --> 00:59:44.578]  We are completely surrounded.
[00:59:44.698 --> 00:59:45.039]  Good.
[00:59:45.399 --> 00:59:47.040]  Don't let any of them escape.
[00:59:48.481 --> 00:59:50.182]  This is just for all the marbles.
[00:59:50.282 --> 00:59:51.223]  Point-blank range.
[00:59:51.303 --> 00:59:52.544]  Get past the propaganda.
[00:59:52.924 --> 00:59:53.704]  Face the facts.
[00:59:53.845 --> 00:59:54.825]  Face the reality.
[00:59:55.185 --> 00:59:55.966]  Engage them.
[00:59:56.266 --> 00:59:57.747]  You do not have a choice.
[00:59:57.847 --> 01:00:00.309]  Licking their boots will only ensure your destruction.
[01:00:01.232 --> 01:00:03.233]  All right, let's go to Mark in Texas.
[01:00:03.293 --> 01:00:04.213]  Mark, go ahead and welcome.
[01:00:05.113 --> 01:00:06.894]  Well, Alex, good to talk to you today.
[01:00:06.914 --> 01:00:14.616]  Hey, if you and I were to talk, we would certainly agree about this a whole lot more than we disagree.
[01:00:15.096 --> 01:00:20.417]  And we do have a terrible trend here, and the whole point is, what are you going to do to stay ahead of the trend?
[01:00:20.457 --> 01:00:23.978]  How can you actually profit from what's coming down?
[01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:25.979]  You don't have a radio on, do you?
[01:00:26.439 --> 01:00:27.219]  No, I do not.
[01:00:27.239 --> 01:00:28.280]  Okay, it's just echoing.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.180]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:00:30.149 --> 01:00:33.832]  Okay, well, you, for one, you have figured out how to profit from what's coming down.
[01:00:34.433 --> 01:00:38.756]  You know, for one thing, you've got a lot of advertisement on there.
[01:00:38.796 --> 01:00:42.199]  You make a lot of money off of what's going on.
[01:00:42.279 --> 01:00:45.261]  So congratulations on that.
[01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:47.723]  No, no, put them on hold.
[01:00:47.763 --> 01:00:50.085]  Let's counter each thing one point at a time.
[01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:54.048]  That's a nice little passive-aggressive thing, and I can tell where it's going.
[01:00:54.328 --> 01:00:57.411]  So before you dole out some more bills, some more chum...
[01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:00.009]  Let me just say this to you.
[01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.870]  Number one, there's nothing wrong with making money if it's done morally.
[01:01:04.991 --> 01:01:10.913]  Number two, if you really want to be honest, I wish the Genesis Network had made $10 million.
[01:01:10.973 --> 01:01:12.213]  Unfortunately, it hasn't.
[01:01:12.733 --> 01:01:20.615]  And the aggregate in seven years, since its inception from another failed network before it, it has actually lost money in the aggregate.
[01:01:20.755 --> 01:01:24.877]  I mean, if you really want to know the numbers, the network has not turned a profit until the last year.
[01:01:24.957 --> 01:01:25.857]  You are a buffoon.
[01:01:26.537 --> 01:01:27.358]  Why don't you do the math?
[01:01:27.398 --> 01:01:40.505]  Why don't you call the network up and buy some advertising and then listen to how many advertisers there are and figure out how much it costs just for our $5,000 a month satellites that we've got two of.
[01:01:41.318 --> 01:01:41.698]  We're good to go.
[01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:12.491]  Okay, I could do a lot more.
[01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:14.872]  I love fighting the New World Order.
[01:02:14.952 --> 01:02:16.712]  I get a thrill out of waking people up.
[01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:24.594]  I'll probably be killed someday for what I do while little coward whiners like you go around sniping at people.
[01:02:25.214 --> 01:02:28.355]  Now, if you've got something you disagree with, buddy, you put it on the table.
[01:02:28.815 --> 01:02:32.415]  But don't sit there and give me a bunch of tripe, okay?
[01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:34.996]  Don't even sit there and try it with me.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.140]  Alright?
[01:02:36.401 --> 01:02:37.181]  Makes me sick.
[01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:38.582]  Now go ahead and finish what you were saying.
[01:02:38.602 --> 01:02:41.324]  How about how you sold out the Gray family?
[01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.045]  There you go.
[01:02:42.065 --> 01:02:43.546]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:44.006 --> 01:02:49.750]  Yesterday, another one of them called in here with a total made-up fable.
[01:02:50.751 --> 01:02:52.472]  And they don't care if stuff's a fable.
[01:02:52.893 --> 01:02:54.514]  And this is because we're hurting them bad.
[01:02:54.554 --> 01:02:57.796]  But the globalists don't even have to come out and attack me.
[01:02:58.196 --> 01:03:02.960]  They can put out this info and then these totally unhappy nobodies...
[01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.763]  Can go out and do whatever they want.
[01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:21.603]  And imagine being Alex Jones, being in Austin, Texas, being on the Genesis Network, and having parasites, a parasite that has moved down here and that has tried to set up an operation and that has put out lies about me that I was an idiot enough to even put up with.
[01:03:22.316 --> 01:03:32.259]  And then to see the fruit of their lies, and then to see them literally trying to sit upon the back of this network and feed on us and do bad things.
[01:03:32.399 --> 01:03:33.719]  Let me just tell you something, all of you.
[01:03:33.999 --> 01:03:42.582]  You are not going to stop us, and we are not afraid of any of the New World Order's minions, and we're going to move forward, and we're going to expose the globalists.
[01:03:42.842 --> 01:03:44.182]  You want to talk about the Iran war?
[01:03:44.202 --> 01:03:46.683]  You want to talk about the Bush administration saying they can torture children?
[01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:47.923]  Let's talk about it.
[01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:51.064]  You want to suck your thumb and be a bunch of trailer trash?
[01:03:51.104 --> 01:03:51.484]  Go ahead.
[01:03:54.727 --> 01:03:57.570]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:58.531]  Hello, my friends.

[01:03:59.752 --> 01:04:04.437]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.777 --> 01:04:11.524]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:13.806]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.026 --> 01:04:16.868]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.948 --> 01:04:21.611]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.812 --> 01:04:26.215]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.475 --> 01:04:33.680]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.941 --> 01:04:36.362]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:03.705]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triomethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:12.971]  Black Fergie elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:15.172]  ...into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:21.256]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:21.476 --> 01:05:28.119]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:35.163]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[01:05:53.106 --> 01:06:01.768]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or one in three adults?
[01:06:02.108 --> 01:06:06.368]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:06:07.189 --> 01:06:11.129]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:06:11.469 --> 01:06:16.510]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:20.711]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like joint care,
[01:06:20.991 --> 01:06:21.671]  We're good to go.
[01:06:21.692 --> 01:06:22.312]  We're good to go.
[01:06:46.106 --> 01:07:01.020]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:04.604]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:13.334 --> 01:07:16.096]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[01:07:16.136 --> 01:07:17.016]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[01:07:17.056 --> 01:07:18.677]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[01:07:19.138 --> 01:07:22.139]  From Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California.
[01:07:22.159 --> 01:07:24.461]  From Kansas City, Missouri to Austin, Texas.
[01:07:24.481 --> 01:07:27.663]  From Pensacola, Florida to Rochester, New York.
[01:07:27.783 --> 01:07:30.484]  Gaining more and more affiliates all the time.
[01:07:30.544 --> 01:07:34.827]  From Montana to places like Needles, California.
[01:07:35.467 --> 01:07:36.428]  There at the three corners.
[01:07:36.508 --> 01:07:38.649]  It's just so exciting to be getting so many new affiliates.
[01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:40.190]  Because really...
[01:07:41.095 --> 01:07:42.375]  We were a little bit ahead of our time.
[01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:49.858]  It was wild to talk about NSA and black site torture programs six, seven years ago, and yet they were going on before Bush got in.
[01:07:49.878 --> 01:07:51.458]  This was just kind of the coming out.
[01:07:52.038 --> 01:07:56.740]  Dictatorships of the elite are not built and manifested overnight.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:07.463]  They build slowly, generally, as societies rot, but the slow-growing tumors are generally the worst when you talk about civilizations and societies.
[01:08:09.464 --> 01:08:14.229]  A great American, Professor Doug Castle, debated a pig demon.
[01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:21.816]  And I don't normally call names, but folks, somebody who goes, yeah, we can torture small children and crush their testicles in front of their parents is a pig demon.
[01:08:21.836 --> 01:08:23.277]  I mean, there's no better word.
[01:08:23.857 --> 01:08:26.740]  Joseph Mingala didn't promote this in the open.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.841]  They had some shame.
[01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:32.926]  And I just learned it was Stephen Bybee that actually wrote the memo saying that.
[01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:44.623]  But then it was John Yoo, another one of these Faustian creatures, who said, yeah, the president, there's no treaty, he can do that if he wants.
[01:08:45.264 --> 01:08:49.046]  Then the president can barbecue small children on the White House lawn.
[01:08:49.467 --> 01:08:56.231]  The president can snort cocaine off the backs of topless dancers in the Oval Office on national TV.
[01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:57.632]  No, he can't do that.
[01:08:58.432 --> 01:09:00.514]  And he is to a higher standard.
[01:09:00.574 --> 01:09:01.474]  Okay, I want to go to our guest.
[01:09:01.494 --> 01:09:02.135]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:04.660]  We're good to go.
[01:09:26.157 --> 01:09:39.750]  And it's a Nazi death cult society, and I snuck into Bohemian Grove, and we've got the Skull and Bones information, and we've got their own autobiographies where they admit that they engage in these rituals, so you can just go off what these elitists say in their own published books with their names on it.
[01:09:40.411 --> 01:09:47.778]  And we got new footage from an employee inside the Grove, not just from my infiltration back in 2000 that's been on national and international television.
[01:09:48.607 --> 01:09:51.070]  The original Dark Secrets has been upgraded.
[01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:53.693]  And then there's the new Order of Death film.
[01:09:53.733 --> 01:09:56.376]  Two films, combo, DVD for the price of one.
[01:09:56.396 --> 01:09:59.940]  $24.95 each additional $9.95 if you want to get one as a gift.
[01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:03.024]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:10:03.364 --> 01:10:04.185]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.880]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:31.089]  Then there's my other new film, Martial Law, and the first hour is the police state, the microwave guns, the blimps, the police threatening to arrest us at the RNC, the police state around the country, and then the reality of 9-11, and then a full hour on the globalist master plan and what these neocons are up to.
[01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:34.851]  That miniseries is $24.95 as well.
[01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:38.093]  It's three films in one, and it's InfoWars.com.
[01:10:38.786 --> 01:10:41.247]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv and see it all online right now.
[01:10:41.607 --> 01:10:42.687]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[01:10:42.807 --> 01:10:44.668]  I am just really fired up.
[01:10:45.388 --> 01:10:49.490]  Bush advisor says president has legal power to torture children.
[01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:58.093]  John Yoo publicly argued that there is no law that could prevent the president from ordering the torture of a child or a suspect in custody, including by crushing that child's...
[01:10:58.513 --> 01:11:04.636]  I'm going to tell you, we don't talk like this on the show, but when the president's people are putting these in memos, you've got to talk about it.
[01:11:04.656 --> 01:11:08.457]  It's like Gonzalez, now Attorney General, says they don't need warrants to spy on you.
[01:11:08.777 --> 01:11:09.978]  I mean, that ought to scare everybody.
[01:11:10.698 --> 01:11:12.139]  That's a felony every time they do that.
[01:11:12.579 --> 01:11:21.483]  This came out in response to a question in a debate in Chicago with Notre Dame professor, international human rights scholar, Doug Castle, who's on with us now.
[01:11:22.323 --> 01:11:25.484]  And he brought up some of these White House memos.
[01:11:25.504 --> 01:11:26.945]  I mean, sick things, folks.
[01:11:27.757 --> 01:11:28.018]  Sick!
[01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:32.604]  I mean, I've read the memos on air where, well, we can torture them to death, and if we don't call it torture, it isn't.
[01:11:33.806 --> 01:11:40.315]  And now torturing children, which is, by the way, came out of the Abu Ghraib General Tugumbu report.
[01:11:41.952 --> 01:11:49.937]  He was charged with it, raping women, beating children in front of people, raping people with large objects dripping with acid.
[01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:54.260]  I mean, again, this is Mingala Jeffrey Dahmer hell pits.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.701]  This is Silence of the Lambs.
[01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.102]  She rubs the lotion on the skin.
[01:11:58.122 --> 01:11:59.403]  That's enough.
[01:11:59.603 --> 01:12:01.204]  Professor, thank you for joining us today.
[01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:02.585]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:12:03.165 --> 01:12:05.287]  I mean, does this freak you out like it freaks me out?
[01:12:05.307 --> 01:12:08.849]  I mean, it's getting so... I think I'm in an alternate dimension.
[01:12:08.869 --> 01:12:10.130]  I mean, this is getting so crazy.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.343]  Well, we're in one of those periods when the executive branch is going off the rails.
[01:12:16.663 --> 01:12:37.033]  And the purpose of my questioning Professor Yu, who's now a professor at Berkeley in California in the law school, about the idea of torturing a child was to really draw out the unstated implications of this Justice Department memo, of which he was, although it was signed by Stephen Bybee, it was actually authored by John Yu.
[01:12:37.771 --> 01:13:04.584]  And in that memo, which was directed in August of 2002 to then-Presidential Legal Counsel Alberto Gonzalez, now the Attorney General, the basic line of argument from the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, which is the official legal advisor to the executive branch, was that whenever the President thinks he needs to do something in order to win a war, he can do it, and no law and no treaty can stop him.
[01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:11.451]  Now, when you read that sort of in the general and the abstract, it sounds they can't really mean do anything.
[01:13:12.292 --> 01:13:17.936]  So I thought I would try to see just how far you would take it in the Chicago debate last month.
[01:13:18.716 --> 01:13:26.722]  And as you have reported, he did indicate that if it involved torturing someone, well, the president could authorize that.
[01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:29.244]  I said, well, what if the guy doesn't talk after you torture him?
[01:13:29.264 --> 01:13:32.386]  Can you torture his child in front of him, including by crushing him?
[01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:35.815]  The testicles, and his answer was legally yes.
[01:13:35.915 --> 01:13:40.764]  Now, to be fair to Professor Yu, he says he's against crushing the testicles of children.
[01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:45.727]  He doesn't think it would be a good idea, but legally he claims the president can do it.
[01:13:45.827 --> 01:13:47.247]  Well, that's total double-think.
[01:13:47.267 --> 01:13:50.689]  You know, I don't like to do this, but we're going to maybe have to.
[01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:52.169]  It's like Tommy Franks.
[01:13:52.369 --> 01:13:58.492]  It's going to be, generals hate to run martial law and have a new military dictatorship, but we're going to have to.
[01:13:59.972 --> 01:14:04.814]  Well, it's basically asking us to throw out the rule of law, because it's basically saying,
[01:14:05.484 --> 01:14:06.865]  We don't think it's a good idea.
[01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:07.825]  We're nice guys.
[01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:08.586]  Trust us.
[01:14:08.726 --> 01:14:09.466]  We won't do it.
[01:14:09.526 --> 01:14:12.148]  But Saddam didn't even... Don't tell us we can't do it.
[01:14:12.368 --> 01:14:14.869]  Saddam didn't even torture people's children in front of him.
[01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:20.052]  I mean, even in the wildest propaganda the neocons spewed about him, that wasn't said.
[01:14:20.072 --> 01:14:22.153]  And then they just write memos about it.
[01:14:22.193 --> 01:14:23.394]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:14:24.315 --> 01:14:24.975]  Well, it's sick.
[01:14:25.035 --> 01:14:26.536]  Unfortunately, there are cases.
[01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:31.919]  Years ago, I was legal advisor to the UN Truth Commission in El Salvador, and we had...
[01:14:32.708 --> 01:14:42.616]  Evidence there that one of the torture techniques used in El Salvador, and there are also reports of this in Chile, is to torture people's children, or in some cases their wives.
[01:14:42.656 --> 01:14:43.897]  But that isn't Saddam.
[01:14:43.977 --> 01:14:45.858]  That's Negroponte's death squads.
[01:14:46.499 --> 01:14:48.460]  That's Negroponte's death squads.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:54.224]  I don't remember whether there was specifically this involving Saddam, but I'm certainly not going to defend Saddam.
[01:14:54.264 --> 01:14:55.425]  He's a bloody guy.
[01:14:55.445 --> 01:14:56.046]  Oh, I understand.
[01:14:56.086 --> 01:14:59.569]  But Negroponte's our new head of all intelligence.
[01:14:59.909 --> 01:15:01.090]  I feel much safer now.
[01:15:02.494 --> 01:15:12.617]  Well, Negroponte was the United States ambassador in Honduras during the early 1980s at a time when Honduran death squads were operating.
[01:15:13.058 --> 01:15:29.863]  The official State Department human rights reports on Honduras at the time did not give any indication that the State Department was aware that the government was backing death squads, let alone that American intelligence agents were involved in some of these interviews where people were tortured
[01:15:30.715 --> 01:15:31.536]  And then killed.
[01:15:31.596 --> 01:15:34.338]  That's not the info I've gotten from our guests and people that were there.
[01:15:34.378 --> 01:15:39.362]  Negroponte supposedly was the prime mover on a lot of that.
[01:15:39.682 --> 01:15:43.966]  And we know that at the School of Americas, they trained those very Latin American countries.
[01:15:44.366 --> 01:15:49.010]  I've had Special Forces commanders on here who trained to put electrodes on the genitalia.
[01:15:49.591 --> 01:15:50.491]  Well, that's my point.
[01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:52.273]  I'm not saying Negroponte wasn't involved.
[01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:53.614]  I'm saying that he was there...
[01:15:54.695 --> 01:16:02.059]  That the official documents did not disclose what one would have to think is highly likely that he must have known at the time.
[01:16:03.079 --> 01:16:04.600]  As far as I know, we don't have any
[01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:10.698]  Evidence admissible in a court that would prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
[01:16:10.738 --> 01:16:14.820]  Regardless, we have this memo by John Yoo.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.661]  Let's get into that.
[01:16:16.021 --> 01:16:18.743]  But imagine, just describe the scene.
[01:16:18.763 --> 01:16:21.625]  You're in there, and you're having this discussion, this debate.
[01:16:21.645 --> 01:16:22.745]  Describe it for us, Professor.
[01:16:23.306 --> 01:16:31.871]  Well, this was a debate on the subject of torture as used against terrorism, sponsored by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:16:31.991 --> 01:16:34.112]  It was held on December 1st in Chicago.
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:41.123]  It was just Professor Yu and me and a moderator on the stage.
[01:16:41.703 --> 01:16:45.525]  Basically, the questions went back and forth.
[01:16:45.605 --> 01:16:55.350]  One of the questions, as I indicated earlier, was designed by me to see if Professor Yu would take it so far as to say that the President could torture children.
[01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:59.012]  As we've indicated, that was exactly what he said as a matter of law.
[01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:00.973]  I'm going to play that clip when we get back.
[01:17:01.293 --> 01:17:04.475]  The Council on Foreign Relations, how many of those guys were in attendance?
[01:17:05.975 --> 01:17:11.779]  It was held actually in a club in Chicago, because this is part of their outreach program to younger members.
[01:17:11.879 --> 01:17:16.522]  I would say that in the audience, probably 150-200 people.
[01:17:16.562 --> 01:17:25.087]  Yeah, because I had read that somehow there were thousands of students watching, and I guess there must be a tape of it that was shown then at a college, because I'm getting conflicting reports here.
[01:17:25.467 --> 01:17:29.170]  Okay, so you've got junior CFR members there.
[01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:31.991]  Were they disgusted, or did people stand up and go, Yes!
[01:17:32.392 --> 01:17:33.372]  Kill the children!
[01:17:33.392 --> 01:17:33.893]  Get them!
[01:17:33.953 --> 01:17:34.593]  I mean, what happened?
[01:17:34.873 --> 01:17:42.584]  No, the people who were at the crowd, while they didn't, I don't know that they specifically commented on that, just in general it was clear.
[01:17:43.593 --> 01:17:52.199]  That about 90%, something like that, of the crowd was opposed to the line of argument that Professor G was presenting.
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.822]  And then probably opposed to Joseph Mingala and Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy, too.
[01:17:55.842 --> 01:17:57.083]  I think that might get up to 91%.
[01:17:57.343 --> 01:18:05.849]  Yeah, I mean, listen, if I was there and somebody was saying, we can crush children's genitalia, I'd say, hey, get out of here, punk!
[01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:09.252]  I mean, I would stand up and yell at them.
[01:18:09.312 --> 01:18:10.793]  This was a very polite crowd.
[01:18:10.813 --> 01:18:11.774]  No, I know, yeah.
[01:18:12.304 --> 01:18:14.786]  No transcript being taken.
[01:18:14.827 --> 01:18:16.308]  There was no official recording.
[01:18:16.348 --> 01:18:25.357]  The recording that's now on the Internet was apparently done by someone in the audience whose method of protest was to make sure that what was said actually got out into the Internet.
[01:18:25.977 --> 01:18:29.481]  Oh, that's right, because a lot of these CFR meetings, they sign nondisclosure agreements.
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.020]  That's right.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.782]  I didn't know, frankly, that it was a... Sorry, there goes my cell phone.
[01:18:34.802 --> 01:18:35.442]  Let me find it.
[01:18:35.922 --> 01:18:36.782]  It's okay, Professor.
[01:18:36.822 --> 01:18:38.423]  We're going to break and come right back.
[01:18:38.443 --> 01:18:38.563]  Okay.
[01:18:38.683 --> 01:18:40.703]  I know I'm getting boisterous here.
[01:18:40.723 --> 01:18:41.844]  I'm just very upset by this.
[01:18:41.864 --> 01:18:43.144]  I mean, we're all in danger, folks.
[01:18:43.164 --> 01:18:48.526]  When they're openly saying they can torture children in front of their parents, I mean, we've entered the ninth circle of hell.
[01:18:48.606 --> 01:18:51.447]  I mean, we are actually in the presence of Satan right now.
[01:18:53.777 --> 01:18:55.239]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:18:55.579 --> 01:18:59.543]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:18:59.924 --> 01:19:03.448]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:19:03.828 --> 01:19:07.372]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[01:19:07.772 --> 01:19:12.638]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:18.743]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:19:19.063 --> 01:19:25.188]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:19:25.528 --> 01:19:31.313]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:32.914]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:19:33.234 --> 01:19:34.354]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:19:34.434 --> 01:19:39.856]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[01:19:40.056 --> 01:19:43.518]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.

[01:19:46.739 --> 01:19:48.900]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[01:19:59.167 --> 01:20:02.808]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[01:20:03.608 --> 01:20:05.068]  It includes the history of U.S.
[01:20:05.128 --> 01:20:09.249]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards.

[01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:13.970]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:15.871]  They are instruments of debt.
[01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:18.231]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[01:20:52.119 --> 01:20:57.420]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.701]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:07.042]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:21:07.182 --> 01:21:18.705]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:21:19.025 --> 01:21:19.826]  We're good to go.
[01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:56.390]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.
[01:21:56.690 --> 01:22:04.435]  RxDrugCard.com is a simple, innovative program designed to give individuals the same purchasing power as large HMOs and insurance companies.
[01:22:04.655 --> 01:22:14.541]  As a member of RxDrugCard.com, you'll enjoy savings of up to 80% on all prescription medications at over 52,000 USA pharmacies, including Walmart, Walgreens, and Eckerd's.
[01:22:14.822 --> 01:22:18.484]  Don't risk ruining your health by using cheap, counterfeit foreign drugs.
[01:22:18.584 --> 01:22:18.964]  We're good to go.
[01:22:48.134 --> 01:23:06.048]  I read several articles about this exchange in Chicago, and I didn't even know it was a...
[01:23:10.234 --> 01:23:13.780]  A CFR branch meeting, and I was just talking to the professor during the break.
[01:23:14.181 --> 01:23:17.687]  Most of the local CFR meetings are open to the public in Chicago.
[01:23:17.948 --> 01:23:22.435]  They just have the secret ones mainly there off 24th Street in New York.
[01:23:23.056 --> 01:23:23.918]  They're at the Pratt House.
[01:23:26.147 --> 01:23:33.231]  So the professor was telling me during the break, and well, right before break, he also said on air he was surprised by getting there, and I guess they told him it was off record.
[01:23:34.132 --> 01:23:35.413]  Professor, please tell us about that.
[01:23:36.173 --> 01:23:44.419]  Well, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, which is a formally independent organization from the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, but they cooperate on a lot of matters.
[01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:59.009]  I've been to many of their programs and in my experience they are generally, not always, but generally open to the public and on the record when you're talking about a large program like this one with about 200 people present.
[01:24:00.109 --> 01:24:05.433]  When I got to this one I was made to realize that this one was
[01:24:10.131 --> 01:24:16.275]  Off the record, in the sense that there was no recording and no transcript being taken of what was being said.
[01:24:17.276 --> 01:24:25.682]  And later on it turned out that someone who was in the audience apparently recorded the debate and has put at least portions of it on the Internet.
[01:24:26.203 --> 01:24:29.105]  Yeah, we've got that up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanta.com.
[01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:30.646]  We'll play that coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:30.986 --> 01:24:37.831]  And we're going to have Kevin Smith, who got video, we put it on TV locally, where they had an official CFR meeting, but it was public as well.
[01:24:38.918 --> 01:24:42.320]  And where they said things just as amazing as what we've caught on tape here.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.702]  But, Professor, getting into the psychology, I mean, you study this.
[01:24:45.722 --> 01:24:50.344]  You've been an advocate for human rights and people's liberties for a long time.
[01:24:50.384 --> 01:24:52.565]  I've done some research on you, and what you've done is admirable.
[01:24:53.285 --> 01:24:54.566]  I mean, did this even shock you?
[01:24:54.586 --> 01:25:00.169]  I mean, I know you've read the memo that they'd penned, but to actually hear him go, yeah, we can do that.
[01:25:00.809 --> 01:25:10.333]  Well, I was shocked when I first read this August 2002 memo, which I first read when it became public for the first time after Abu Ghraib in about June of 2004.
[01:25:11.994 --> 01:25:27.380]  I was shocked then because I never thought, as a human rights lawyer who goes around the world trying to do what we can to prevent and to punish people who commit torture, I never thought that I would have to be debating in my own country
[01:25:28.344 --> 01:25:31.427]  The idea that it's okay for the president to authorize torture.
[01:25:33.069 --> 01:25:49.464]  The shock for me really came back in 2004 when it became obvious on reading this memo that torture at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere was not merely a matter of some low-level soldier or prison guard going haywire, but was a matter of high-level
[01:25:50.146 --> 01:25:51.306]  Official policy.
[01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:55.548]  Yeah, the memos went out to the Pentagon and they gave it to the officers and they had the private wings.
[01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:58.609]  We interviewed Janice Karpinski, who wouldn't play ball with them.
[01:25:58.629 --> 01:26:00.469]  She wasn't even allowed in those wings of the prisons.
[01:26:00.749 --> 01:26:04.951]  Then they tried to blame her for something she hadn't done when she didn't go along with it.
[01:26:04.991 --> 01:26:06.371]  They made her the fall girl.
[01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:14.694]  The August 2002 memo, which by the way has now been officially revoked by the Justice Department after it became public and became very embarrassing.
[01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:17.735]  But we got this big lawyer who works for them still defending it.
[01:26:18.499 --> 01:26:28.439]  Well, not only is this lawyer who worked for them, he's now out of government and a professor is still defending it, but when they revoked it, they reissued a new memo in December of 2004.
[01:26:30.493 --> 01:26:40.156]  But that new memo did not withdraw all the claims made in the August 2002 memo, and one of the claims it did not withdraw was the very wanted issue here.
[01:26:40.516 --> 01:26:43.497]  And now Steve Bybee, he is now a federal judge, right?
[01:26:43.557 --> 01:26:58.142]  Stephen Bybee, who was then an official in the Justice Department, was since elevated to the federal bench by nomination of... And so they're stacking the executive agencies and the judiciary with these ghouls.
[01:26:59.745 --> 01:27:04.689]  Well, I don't know Mr. Bybee, so I don't know whether I would call him a ghoul.
[01:27:04.710 --> 01:27:09.314]  Well, you said he signed off on you's... He signed off on you's memo.
[01:27:09.354 --> 01:27:18.844]  To be fair to Mr. Bybee, he was not present at the exchange about crushing children's testicles, and I hope he would recoil at the suggestion that that would be...
[01:27:20.177 --> 01:27:26.580]  Well, we can say Alberto Gonzalez is a ghoul, you know, saying they can torture people to death and then not call it torture.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.501]  I mean, we know he's the Attorney General.
[01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:30.722]  I mean, are they not stacking the courts with their ghouls?
[01:27:31.262 --> 01:27:41.707]  They are stacking the courts and the executive branch agencies, unfortunately, with people like John Yoo and many others of his persuasion.
[01:27:43.283 --> 01:27:44.224]  We're good to go.
[01:27:44.244 --> 01:27:44.805]  I think?
[01:28:05.094 --> 01:28:05.735]  Necessary.
[01:28:05.775 --> 01:28:06.936]  The courts can't interfere.
[01:28:06.956 --> 01:28:12.060]  Well, I've even got a clip of Specter, who they push to get appointed as the head of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate.
[01:28:12.361 --> 01:28:13.942]  Their boy, Mr. Magic Bullet.
[01:28:14.803 --> 01:28:15.764]  We played it a few days ago.
[01:28:16.104 --> 01:28:19.727]  Going, well, I'm kind of upset, but the president may have this executive power.
[01:28:19.987 --> 01:28:24.351]  Of course he's going to say in his hearing next week or two weeks from now, he's got this power.
[01:28:24.772 --> 01:28:26.073]  I mean, we're just in deep trouble.
[01:28:26.233 --> 01:28:27.714]  I mean, they're throwing down the gauntlet.
[01:28:27.754 --> 01:28:28.535]  Professor, stay with us.
[01:28:28.575 --> 01:28:30.637]  I want to hear more of what you have to say when we get back.
[01:28:30.657 --> 01:28:31.498]  I want to play this clip.
[01:28:31.918 --> 01:28:35.022]  And I got Kevin Smith in here who witnessed, and we have the video of it.
[01:28:35.302 --> 01:28:36.604]  We ought to put that on the radio sometime.
[01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:39.247]  The audio's pretty bad because it was far away.
[01:28:39.487 --> 01:28:41.630]  Where they're sitting there talking about concentration camps.
[01:28:44.213 --> 01:28:45.134]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.614 --> 01:28:47.236]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.256 --> 01:28:50.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.423 --> 01:28:58.869]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:28:59.149 --> 01:29:02.754]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:29:02.874 --> 01:29:10.984]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:29:11.244 --> 01:29:16.907]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:29:17.187 --> 01:29:22.450]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:24.791]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:29:25.051 --> 01:29:37.198]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:41.861]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:29:42.062 --> 01:29:43.022]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:43.202 --> 01:29:44.824]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:29:44.944 --> 01:29:46.745]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:29:47.005 --> 01:29:47.466]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:29:47.486 --> 01:29:47.686]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:29:54.443 --> 01:29:56.424]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:56.504 --> 01:30:07.229]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.609 --> 01:30:12.111]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:12.191 --> 01:30:23.516]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:24.116 --> 01:30:30.960]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.481]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.981 --> 01:30:38.944]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:39.244 --> 01:30:46.009]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:46.209 --> 01:30:49.811]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:50.051 --> 01:30:50.792]  That's toll free.
[01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:50.852]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:55.396 --> 01:30:57.738]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:57.978 --> 01:31:00.020]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:07.205]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:07.485 --> 01:31:16.012]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:31:16.392 --> 01:31:21.078]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:31:21.218 --> 01:31:25.263]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:31:25.463 --> 01:31:27.906]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:32.411]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:35.815 --> 01:31:38.877]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:38.917 --> 01:31:40.838]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:06.306 --> 01:32:09.187]  All right, our final segment with the professor.
[01:32:09.867 --> 01:32:13.648]  Professor, we've only got 10, 15 minutes left with you here or less.
[01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:27.191]  Before we let Kevin Smith get in here and talk a little bit about some of the things he's witnessed and play this little two-minute clip that was ferried out of the secret CFR meeting up there that you were there debating this pig demon at...
[01:32:28.011 --> 01:32:29.112]  I'm sorry, that's my term.
[01:32:29.192 --> 01:32:29.853]  They deserve it.
[01:32:29.873 --> 01:32:31.774]  I mean, I would call Joseph Mingala a pig demon.
[01:32:32.094 --> 01:32:35.096]  That's just my own little term I like to use that describes these creatures.
[01:32:35.877 --> 01:32:37.478]  That's just kind of what I see them as.
[01:32:38.098 --> 01:32:42.882]  But to be really serious here, any other key points that you think people need to know that you haven't had a chance to make?
[01:32:43.242 --> 01:32:48.446]  Any websites we should visit to see any of your writings or any of the things that you're fighting right now?
[01:32:49.006 --> 01:33:05.796]  Well, one key point is that, as many people may know, with the leadership of Senator John McCain and a number of others, Congress passed a law in late 2005 that said that torture is just completely illegal.
[01:33:06.057 --> 01:33:07.738]  No agent of the U.S.
[01:33:07.778 --> 01:33:11.680]  government can conduct torture anywhere, anytime, for any reason.
[01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:23.133]  When the president signed that bill, which he signed only because it was passed in both houses with an overwhelming veto-proof majority... He declared an imaginary power and said, I don't have to follow this.
[01:33:23.433 --> 01:33:29.255]  He basically said, I am signing this subject to my powers as commander-in-chief.
[01:33:29.396 --> 01:33:39.180]  So as recently as late last year, just a month or two ago, the president is continuing to maintain the same legal theory that John Yoo...
[01:33:39.989 --> 01:33:43.632]  And Stephen Bybee put into that memo back in August of 2002.
[01:33:44.213 --> 01:34:01.767]  But Professor Castle, I have the Article 2, Section 2, and it clearly says that he's only the Commander-in-Chief when Congress declares war and specifically funds him with a specific job, and that he must abide by the Constitution, but that's the complete opposite.
[01:34:01.807 --> 01:34:04.029]  He claims that it literally makes him God-Emperor.
[01:34:04.847 --> 01:34:11.450]  Well, and that's the theory of Professor Yu that has now become accepted, apparently, by the Bush administration.
[01:34:11.490 --> 01:34:15.252]  And when that theory is taken to its extreme, there is no limit.
[01:34:15.392 --> 01:34:18.593]  And that was exactly the point of that question in Chicago.
[01:34:18.733 --> 01:34:22.655]  According to these guys, there are simply no legal limits on the president.
[01:34:23.175 --> 01:34:24.656]  That is not the rule of law.
[01:34:24.696 --> 01:34:27.397]  That's not what our Constitution was intended to establish.
[01:34:28.138 --> 01:34:36.005]  Well, I mean, listen, martial law, total control, tyrannies, so they can bid rig and warp rob a tyranny and just do it all right out in front of us.
[01:34:36.585 --> 01:34:40.889]  So, you know, that congressman in California won't go to jail in the future for stealing $800 million.
[01:34:40.909 --> 01:34:41.570]  It's no big deal.
[01:34:41.610 --> 01:34:43.892]  I mean, literally to a fake post office box.
[01:34:45.172 --> 01:34:49.833]  If they're supreme rulers, they can do whatever they want, and they're actually openly declaring that power.
[01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:53.854]  I mean, Bush said things would be a heck of a lot easier if this was a dictatorship.
[01:34:54.134 --> 01:34:55.274]  In fact, guys, find that clip.
[01:34:55.294 --> 01:34:55.915]  It's in the computer.
[01:34:56.715 --> 01:35:02.616]  If this was a dictatorship, so long as I'm a dictator, and that's now what they're declaring.
[01:35:02.636 --> 01:35:04.156]  Do you disagree with that statement, Professor?
[01:35:04.636 --> 01:35:07.737]  No, but what they also declare is, trust us.
[01:35:07.857 --> 01:35:08.837]  We're nice guys.
[01:35:08.897 --> 01:35:09.978]  We're reasonable people.
[01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:12.138]  We're just trying to do what's right for the country.
[01:35:12.665 --> 01:35:18.510]  And the problem with their message is they don't come out of the closet as, as you say, pig demons.
[01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:25.655]  They present themselves as reasonable people just presenting a particular constitutional interpretation.
[01:35:25.695 --> 01:35:28.017]  That is a seductive approach.
[01:35:28.698 --> 01:35:35.063]  It's one that is capable, unfortunately, of misleading many Americans into thinking, well, this guy's not so bad.
[01:35:35.623 --> 01:35:41.668]  But the problem is once you remove any constitutional or legal constraint on the president to
[01:35:42.421 --> 01:35:47.766]  Even go so far as to torture children, in the opinion of Professor Yu, then the sky's the limit.
[01:35:47.786 --> 01:35:53.391]  There's no law, there's no Congress, there's no court, there's no international community to stop them.
[01:35:53.431 --> 01:35:54.532]  Exactly, Professor Castle.
[01:35:54.552 --> 01:35:59.397]  They've got to come out public and say it to legitimize it if they're planning to use it.
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.600]  And all the preparations we're seeing.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.761]  I mean, my friend, I've been to urban warfare drills where U.S.
[01:36:04.801 --> 01:36:07.842]  military is trying to take over America, and they admit it.
[01:36:09.122 --> 01:36:11.363]  And they're openly saying, get rid of Posse Comitatus.
[01:36:12.183 --> 01:36:19.805]  They've got these TSA Viper teams now right here in Texas just randomly surrounding buildings and just searching everyone.
[01:36:20.045 --> 01:36:21.305]  And they say it's just random.
[01:36:21.345 --> 01:36:22.505]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[01:36:23.385 --> 01:36:24.926]  Well, again, my point is...
[01:36:26.114 --> 01:36:40.520]  They have already done some things, but what worries me more than anything else is that once they tear down the rule of law, once they remove any legal or institutional constraint on what they want to do, then we have to worry about how far they can go in the future.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:47.263]  They're already doing it in some cases, but if this theory is allowed to stand, we have no protection.
[01:36:47.623 --> 01:36:48.144]  Go ahead.
[01:36:48.164 --> 01:36:49.724]  Did you say you had that dictator clip?
[01:36:49.744 --> 01:36:51.245]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:36:52.766 --> 01:36:53.426]  But that's okay.
[01:36:54.602 --> 01:36:56.943]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[01:36:58.484 --> 01:36:59.785]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:37:02.447 --> 01:37:05.608]  And folks, remember, I've been a Republican right out of high school.
[01:37:06.069 --> 01:37:07.109]  I am a conservative.
[01:37:07.169 --> 01:37:08.350]  I'm pro-gun, everything.
[01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:09.731]  Folks, I'm telling you, George Bush...
[01:37:10.331 --> 01:37:12.392]  is about as conservative as the Tooth Fairy.
[01:37:13.133 --> 01:37:14.854]  I want to bring in Kevin Smith.
[01:37:14.994 --> 01:37:17.695]  Kevin goes to a lot of these meetings, tracks a lot of this.
[01:37:18.136 --> 01:37:22.138]  Kevin, you went to two series, the War on Terror series and the, quote, New World Order series.
[01:37:22.698 --> 01:37:29.842]  And just quickly for the professor, because he wasn't there, perhaps you can get in contact with him in sending this other video or whoever's getting this secret tape out.
[01:37:29.882 --> 01:37:31.223]  We're going to play it in a minute.
[01:37:31.563 --> 01:37:36.606]  But, I mean, tell him what we've got on tape with the former CIA director and professor, Lino Graglia.
[01:37:37.468 --> 01:37:39.148]  Professor Castle, it's good to speak with you today.
[01:37:39.168 --> 01:37:39.869]  Thank you.
[01:37:40.469 --> 01:37:41.649]  Let me set this a little bit.
[01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:51.651]  This was the first day of the war back in March of 2003 while the liberal college professors were battling the riot cops down in downtown Austin.
[01:37:51.771 --> 01:37:57.953]  I took it upon myself and a few other people to go to a lecture that night by Ann Marie Slaughter.
[01:37:58.033 --> 01:37:59.373]  She is the dean of
[01:37:59.913 --> 01:38:00.514]  We're good to go.
[01:38:15.433 --> 01:38:19.134]  Professor Leo Graglia, Philip Bobbitt, a number of people were pretty put out by it.
[01:38:19.254 --> 01:38:22.775]  But there was maybe 250, 300 people at this event.
[01:38:22.855 --> 01:38:32.017]  So they were having a three-day festival lavishing Philip Bobbitt over his new book, Shield of Achilles, where he had actually predicted events such as 9-11.
[01:38:32.797 --> 01:38:43.259]  And there was a Saturday luncheon lecture, and I thought, I'm going to go to this, I'm going to get there before them, I'm going to be set up, and I'm going to confront them for what they're doing and bring up Brzezinski's book and all those things.
[01:38:43.968 --> 01:38:48.692]  And I got to it, and it was a luncheon lecture, and there was only 15 people there.
[01:38:48.872 --> 01:38:50.214]  And I thought, different tact.
[01:38:50.274 --> 01:38:51.895]  I'll go in there and ask them if I can film it.
[01:38:51.915 --> 01:38:52.336]  They let me.
[01:38:52.836 --> 01:38:55.218]  I sat at the big board table directly across from Woolsey.
[01:38:55.819 --> 01:38:57.961]  But tell them what happened, Kevin.
[01:38:58.341 --> 01:38:59.842]  So in this meeting, it's...
[01:39:00.903 --> 01:39:16.088]  And it's scary that the moderate in the room was Woolsey, but there's Professor Leo Graglia, there's Professor Philip Bobbitt, there's Harold Prince, I believe Bobby Inman was there, Ann Marie Slaughter, and these arguments they were having, Graglia was chastising.
[01:39:16.688 --> 01:39:16.989]  I think.
[01:39:17.009 --> 01:39:17.209]  I think.
[01:39:40.516 --> 01:39:55.689]  And then they start dripping and smacking their lips and, you know, Woolsey looking like some little conehead Martian, rubbing his little hands together with those big hypnotic eyes going, World War IV is coming, we will win!
[01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:57.631]  A professor comments on that.
[01:39:58.631 --> 01:40:07.439]  Well, you're always going to have, obviously I wasn't there and don't know who said what, but you're always going to have people in or close to governments.
[01:40:08.072 --> 01:40:15.999]  Who, for reasons that they think are in good faith and well-meaning, are going to propose things like concentration camps and torture.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.581]  You're never going to get rid of that.
[01:40:17.681 --> 01:40:32.775]  What you need, however, are independent courts with clear laws and constitutional principles and international treaties so that some independent check can be imposed on the inevitable excesses of people in and close to the executive branch.
[01:40:33.283 --> 01:40:55.607]  So once again, my answer is, it's good that if they're going to say these things, that they can be recorded and brought out to the open, but what we need are courts who can stop them, and what worries me about the nomination of Judge Alito to the Supreme Court is that there's nothing in the record... He's another one that wrote in memos that the executive is God Emperor.
[01:40:56.267 --> 01:40:58.807]  Well, his memos are a bit ambiguous.
[01:40:59.007 --> 01:41:02.448]  If you look at what he wrote about the so-called unitary executive...
[01:41:03.095 --> 01:41:09.857]  He is there using a phrase which is also used by the John Hughes of the world, but he did not spell out what he meant by it.
[01:41:09.937 --> 01:41:12.718]  Well, I read on air some of the quotes out of memos.
[01:41:12.738 --> 01:41:14.599]  I mean, certainly there's a diverse body.
[01:41:15.139 --> 01:41:21.681]  I mean, he said in front of the Senate last week that he doesn't believe in a supreme presidency, but we do have memos that contradict that.
[01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:25.102]  I mean, they're not pushing him forward unless he's for that.
[01:41:25.482 --> 01:41:30.025]  Well, he's been very careful about what he has said, particularly in the confirmation hearings.
[01:41:30.085 --> 01:41:42.133]  But my point about Alito is that we are at a time in our history when you have things being said such as Kevin Smith just referred to, and such as John Yoo put in that memo from the Justice Department.
[01:41:42.794 --> 01:41:50.179]  We're at a point in our history where we need Supreme Court justices who know how to stand up and put up a stop sign.
[01:41:51.307 --> 01:42:06.327]  And while I suspect that Alito would go along with what the White House is proposing, what is clear and beyond any doubt to me is that we have no evidence that he is the kind of person that we need.
[01:42:07.105 --> 01:42:10.448]  It's not enough to say, well, we haven't caught him with a smoking gun.
[01:42:10.508 --> 01:42:18.295]  We ought to be saying, unless you can show me a Supreme Court justice who's prepared to stand up to these guys, that person should not be confirmed.
[01:42:18.575 --> 01:42:18.975]  Exactly.
[01:42:19.015 --> 01:42:24.180]  It's almost worse to not know what you're getting, to just kind of draw a card out of the deck randomly.
[01:42:24.898 --> 01:42:29.443]  Well, he's not random, but he's a sort of a stealth candidate.
[01:42:29.744 --> 01:42:33.868]  No, I know that, but I'm saying for the American people, all we have is this PR machine.
[01:42:33.888 --> 01:42:38.413]  But listen, let's say Republicans love George Bush and want him to be dictator, and I've heard him say that.
[01:42:38.473 --> 01:42:39.694]  Hey, what's wrong with the dictatorship?
[01:42:39.734 --> 01:42:43.519]  He's a good conservative who's spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:42:44.079 --> 01:42:47.660]  Who's appointing anti-gun judges everywhere because he's very conservative and wants open borders.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.661]  Very conservative professor.
[01:42:50.001 --> 01:42:51.742]  It's just wonderfully conservative.
[01:42:52.022 --> 01:42:54.542]  But what about when there's a Hillary Clinton in office?
[01:42:54.582 --> 01:42:57.904]  What about ten years from now when there's somebody else?
[01:42:58.004 --> 01:42:59.784]  I mean, let's say Bush is a little angel.
[01:43:00.224 --> 01:43:02.065]  Still, it's our form of government.
[01:43:02.125 --> 01:43:05.326]  We're America because we have this Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:43:06.007 --> 01:43:12.895]  And that's really what is summed up in the phrase that we need a government of laws and not of men, or nowadays we would say of men and women.
[01:43:13.096 --> 01:43:18.282]  Your point is exactly right, that whether you like whoever is in office today or not,
[01:43:19.261 --> 01:43:25.265]  Somebody else may be in office tomorrow, and if there are no limits on what that person can do, sooner or later, we will come to regret it.
[01:43:25.505 --> 01:43:31.188]  Well, the Democrats are now saying that this is the administration of corruption, and it's true.
[01:43:31.248 --> 01:43:36.892]  I mean, Bush to come in and say, we're going to be the uncorrupt, the upstanding administration.
[01:43:36.912 --> 01:43:39.333]  You talk about double-think, double-speak.
[01:43:39.393 --> 01:43:41.915]  I mean, it's the complete opposite, just the level.
[01:43:42.335 --> 01:43:45.357]  No one's ever gotten away with this much open stealing.
[01:43:45.377 --> 01:43:48.259]  I mean, the vice president running the Halliburton Contracts,
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:44:04.729]  Well, it is, of course, illegal, and there are many more things that they're doing that are not illegal.
[01:44:04.769 --> 01:44:14.115]  We've got an election system right now which is built on money, and most of the campaign contributions on which candidates rely are legal.
[01:44:14.195 --> 01:44:17.537]  So that's obviously another whole subject, but to me the problem of
[01:44:18.132 --> 01:44:29.140]  American democracy now being beholden to people who have enough money and corporations that have enough money to pay for it is part of the problem that leads us to this place in the first place.
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:33.983]  We're going to let you go here in just a minute or two, but I want to get your take, just any final comments after we play this clip.
[01:44:34.503 --> 01:44:44.350]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip from back in December, and this just came out last week because the audio got loaded onto the web and then got picked up by the news, of John Yoo.
[01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:45.511]  It's one thing to have his memo.
[01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:50.274]  If the president deems that he's got to torture somebody, including by crushing the testicles of the person's child, there is no law that can stop that.
[01:44:50.294 --> 01:44:50.574]  No treaty.
[01:45:12.218 --> 01:45:13.801]  And also no law by Congress.
[01:45:13.841 --> 01:45:15.844]  That's what you wrote in the August 2002 memo.
[01:45:15.924 --> 01:45:18.389]  I think it depends on why the President thinks he needs to do that.
[01:45:21.423 --> 01:45:24.004]  So, there is the clip.
[01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:39.050]  Now the same crowd that's been contending to liars keeps saying, nukes, nukes, nukes, when remove the seals, remove the seals, professor, when the seals are peaceful areas for peaceful nuclear power.
[01:45:39.110 --> 01:45:44.993]  That's admitted by all the engineers and the experts, but the media is acting like we're about to be nuked any minute by Iran.
[01:45:45.053 --> 01:45:50.235]  In closing, give us your take on the whole PNAC, New American Century Empire.
[01:45:51.135 --> 01:45:56.117]  Well, I don't think I can do that in a quick closing phrase, but let me clarify that.
[01:45:56.177 --> 01:46:00.019]  Last answer by John Yoo, he said he thinks it depends on what the president's purpose is.
[01:46:00.619 --> 01:46:10.644]  What he meant by that, what was clear from his writings, is that his position, if the president's purpose is to, in effect, prosecute a war, the president can do whatever he wants.
[01:46:11.064 --> 01:46:15.986]  If the president's purpose were just to be vindictive or something like that, of course he could not.
[01:46:16.599 --> 01:46:22.362]  So the answer was a little ambiguous, but essentially it says the president's war powers give him carte blanche.
[01:46:22.862 --> 01:46:33.668]  That is not something that Americans, Republican, Democrat, or otherwise... But that is nowhere in precedent other than Lincoln arresting his political enemies.
[01:46:35.221 --> 01:46:41.788]  But that is light years away from torturing small children in front of their parents.
[01:46:42.128 --> 01:46:42.729]  Well, that's right.
[01:46:42.749 --> 01:46:45.852]  And this is one of those areas where you don't need precedent.
[01:46:45.972 --> 01:46:56.143]  If you get someone who says that that kind of thing is lawful, then in my view, that is just so far off the charts of any good constitutional judgment.
[01:46:57.027 --> 01:47:02.551]  That we need, again, to stand up and to make sure we have Supreme Court justices who will stand up and put a stop to it.
[01:47:02.611 --> 01:47:04.532]  We've only got about 60 seconds left with our guest.
[01:47:04.592 --> 01:47:06.453]  Kevin, any final comments or questions for him?
[01:47:06.613 --> 01:47:08.574]  Yeah, Professor Castle, one last thing.
[01:47:09.034 --> 01:47:13.437]  During that meeting, Anne-Marie Slaughter at one point said, well, this is two days into the war, mind you.
[01:47:13.457 --> 01:47:23.483]  She said, now we can't let the American people know that Iraq will simply be a base of operations for permanent bases to then launch attacks on Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.
[01:47:23.823 --> 01:47:25.925]  And at the end of the program, I got to ask a question.
[01:47:25.945 --> 01:47:26.185]  I said...
[01:47:26.665 --> 01:47:30.347]  You know, how many millions of people are you planning on killing in this World War IV?
[01:47:30.407 --> 01:47:32.928]  And they looked at me like, that's not even a consideration.
[01:47:32.988 --> 01:47:37.029]  So we, the American public, judge these success or not by the number of our dead.
[01:47:37.129 --> 01:47:38.970]  That's not how they factor these things.
[01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.670]  Oh, exactly.
[01:47:39.710 --> 01:47:40.911]  I forgot that point, Professor.
[01:47:41.671 --> 01:47:44.932]  They were openly saying what's in the PNAC document cynically.
[01:47:45.433 --> 01:47:50.755]  They say we can't let them know because they know the average person isn't going to go to their little meeting.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:56.303]  We want your point of view on the whole war situation in closing.
[01:47:57.524 --> 01:48:10.433]  Well, first of all, the war in Iraq is, in my judgment, a violation of international law, and indeed it fits within the definition of a crime against peace as defined at Nuremberg.
[01:48:11.053 --> 01:48:16.097]  Secondly, the so-called war against terrorism does not qualify as a war against
[01:48:16.698 --> 01:48:22.603]  Under international law, it could be referred to as a war in the same sense as the war on drugs or the war on poverty.
[01:48:22.703 --> 01:48:24.145]  It's a nebulous witch hunt.
[01:48:25.366 --> 01:48:26.487]  A rhetorical device.
[01:48:27.007 --> 01:48:43.302]  But the problem with using that language loosely is that the president then decides to say, well, all of the powers that I would have in a legal, recognized war, I can now exercise in this so-called war against terrorism.
[01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:57.991]  And I can treat any individual that I identify anywhere in the world, whether or not he or she is an American citizen, whether or not they're in the United States, I can on the basis of secret intelligence information identify that person as a, quote,
[01:48:58.604 --> 01:49:00.005]  Unlawful enemy combatant.
[01:49:00.045 --> 01:49:07.210]  Yeah, persons of interest, and you disappear into a black site where some pig demon from the Cold War is torturing you.
[01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:09.532]  I mean, this is, again, science fiction bizarre.
[01:49:10.233 --> 01:49:13.575]  Professor, we're going to let you go, but in ten seconds, do you think they're going to fail?
[01:49:13.655 --> 01:49:15.016]  Do you think they're going to go down?
[01:49:15.396 --> 01:49:19.299]  Or will they get the permultimate, real Nazi Germany-type control?
[01:49:19.379 --> 01:49:20.380]  Are we all going to camps?
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:27.525]  I think how far they can go depends on how many Americans get informed about what they're trying to do and try to put a stop to it.
[01:49:28.277 --> 01:49:30.459]  But, I mean, where do you see the breaks?
[01:49:30.519 --> 01:49:31.499]  I mean, do you see them failing?
[01:49:31.539 --> 01:49:32.240]  I see them failing.
[01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:38.925]  I see radio shows like yours and programs that raise these issues as the best defense we have.
[01:49:39.125 --> 01:49:41.767]  So you're not even sure we're going to make it?
[01:49:41.947 --> 01:49:44.709]  I'm an optimist by nature, but I want to emphasize that...
[01:49:45.231 --> 01:49:48.094]  Success doesn't come easily, it doesn't come automatically.
[01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:49.936]  So we're fighting for our lives.
[01:49:50.096 --> 01:49:50.977]  We're fighting for our lives.
[01:49:51.017 --> 01:49:51.698]  Take care, Professor.
[01:49:52.158 --> 01:49:52.538]  Thank you.
[01:49:54.601 --> 01:50:01.988]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.248 --> 01:50:06.933]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.193 --> 01:50:07.733]  We're good to go.
[01:50:07.753 --> 01:50:08.214]  We're good to go.
[01:50:29.703 --> 01:50:32.205]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:50:32.445 --> 01:50:39.189]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:39.389 --> 01:50:44.652]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.672 --> 01:50:45.073]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.792 --> 01:50:57.696]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.916 --> 01:51:03.341]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.621 --> 01:51:13.991]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.151 --> 01:51:18.495]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.675 --> 01:51:23.059]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at
[01:51:47.398 --> 01:51:48.218]  We're good to go.
[01:51:48.258 --> 01:51:48.518]  I think?
[01:52:10.425 --> 01:52:11.066]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.663 --> 01:52:31.283]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.627 --> 01:53:04.033]  We're talking about 9-11.
[01:53:04.053 --> 01:53:06.135]  Coming up in the next segment.
[01:53:06.575 --> 01:53:07.656]  Take some calls right now.
[01:53:09.597 --> 01:53:09.917]  Listen.
[01:53:11.459 --> 01:53:20.925]  You just heard another top professor, international human rights lawyer, on the air with us saying we may all be going to concentration camps and it may be Nazi Germany.
[01:53:20.965 --> 01:53:23.187]  I mean, see folks, this isn't a joke or a game.
[01:53:23.889 --> 01:53:25.852]  I mean, they're up there declaring that they're dictators.
[01:53:25.872 --> 01:53:28.457]  They've got top generals saying, well, it's what's coming next.
[01:53:28.877 --> 01:53:30.340]  They're gearing us all up for it.
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:33.244]  And if we all go along with it, then stuff gets bad.
[01:53:33.264 --> 01:53:37.712]  See, they want the police state to take your pension funds, to rape you financially.
[01:53:39.094 --> 01:53:42.415]  They have to have it in place to really get control.
[01:53:42.955 --> 01:53:46.516]  It's not enough to loot trillions out of the Pentagon Trust funds and to do all this.
[01:53:46.576 --> 01:53:47.476]  Now they want even more.
[01:53:47.536 --> 01:53:49.257]  I mean, that's why they're pig demons.
[01:53:49.277 --> 01:53:57.059]  They're big, evil, fat, slobbering creatures that just want it all, and they want it now, and they're going to get it.
[01:53:58.359 --> 01:53:59.780]  And Bush is a puppet.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.921]  They're front men for this financial interest, and this is for all the marbles.
[01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:06.170]  We are fighting for our lives.
[01:54:06.230 --> 01:54:07.091]  Do you understand?
[01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:08.111]  This is not a joke.
[01:54:08.491 --> 01:54:09.511]  This is not a game.
[01:54:09.551 --> 01:54:10.672]  This is not a drill.
[01:54:11.532 --> 01:54:13.252]  We have got to move forward.
[01:54:15.873 --> 01:54:18.014]  What I heard is a term people are using on the Internet.
[01:54:18.534 --> 01:54:19.254]  Our listeners are.
[01:54:19.414 --> 01:54:20.834]  Information drive-by.
[01:54:21.375 --> 01:54:22.235]  Go to the chat rooms.
[01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:23.115]  Go to the message boards.
[01:54:23.155 --> 01:54:24.115]  Call into the talk shows.
[01:54:24.155 --> 01:54:25.016]  Put up websites.
[01:54:25.796 --> 01:54:27.116]  Just spray the info.
[01:54:27.236 --> 01:54:28.056]  Fire and forget.
[01:54:28.277 --> 01:54:28.997]  We're telling the truth.
[01:54:29.017 --> 01:54:29.817]  We've got the facts.
[01:54:30.689 --> 01:54:32.830]  And believe me, our view is becoming the majority view.
[01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:34.590]  We are waking people up.
[01:54:35.290 --> 01:54:39.752]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paula in Florida, then James, Thomas, Alex, and others.
[01:54:39.772 --> 01:54:40.632]  Go ahead, Paula.
[01:54:40.652 --> 01:54:41.672]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:42.233 --> 01:54:44.373]  I'll tell you what, hon, you're awesome.
[01:54:44.573 --> 01:54:45.634]  You're right about this.
[01:54:45.714 --> 01:54:46.954]  These people are so sick.
[01:54:47.154 --> 01:54:52.276]  I read the book that Tex Mars wrote, and I'll tell you what, it just totally depressed me.
[01:54:52.376 --> 01:54:55.897]  I mean, I was so angry and so... You're talking about Codex Magica?
[01:54:56.137 --> 01:54:56.417]  Yeah.
[01:54:56.557 --> 01:54:57.357]  Now, we carry that.
[01:54:57.377 --> 01:54:59.018]  Yeah, and the circle of intrigue.
[01:54:59.505 --> 01:54:59.745]  Yes.
[01:54:59.805 --> 01:55:01.746]  And it had the list of everybody that belongs to this.
[01:55:01.766 --> 01:55:02.707]  Yes.
[01:55:02.727 --> 01:55:09.770]  And they said in there that because of who they are, they're from the House of David, they think they have the right to control everybody and everything.
[01:55:10.551 --> 01:55:12.392]  And I tell you what, they're about as sick as they can get.
[01:55:12.652 --> 01:55:14.453]  They are, and they're usurpers.
[01:55:14.473 --> 01:55:15.834]  They're false parasites.
[01:55:15.914 --> 01:55:16.474]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:16.794 --> 01:55:18.595]  I appreciate your call.
[01:55:18.615 --> 01:55:21.136]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Maryland.
[01:55:21.176 --> 01:55:21.837]  James, go ahead.
[01:55:21.857 --> 01:55:22.257]  You're on the air.
[01:55:23.047 --> 01:55:23.947]  Hello, it's Jason.
[01:55:24.308 --> 01:55:26.429]  Okay, Jason, go ahead.
[01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:38.434]  First, I've got something I want to say, but I want to address first the people that keep calling in and giving you a ration of stuff about some fabricated story.
[01:55:38.675 --> 01:55:40.896]  Do you people understand that your house is burning down?
[01:55:41.916 --> 01:55:43.537]  But why are you attacking a patriot?
[01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:45.250]  I know.
[01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:52.872]  I mean, we've got all these government people on admitting that they're building camps and the country's going down and somebody's going, Alex, you're bad because you sell videos.
[01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:54.312]  Well, what am I supposed to do?
[01:55:54.372 --> 01:55:57.173]  Do a radio show with a tin can out on the side of the street?
[01:55:57.553 --> 01:56:06.815]  Well, the thing is, if these people would take the time to check the facts that you put on the air and document what you say and find that it's true, it really doesn't matter.
[01:56:09.436 --> 01:56:12.039]  Look, this is a psychological thing, Jason.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:30.298]  A lot of people, the government puts out its disinfo, their COINTELPRO ops put it out on anybody who's successfully fighting them, and then the little minions, they know a psychological type out there is going to pick up on it who's so upset by the information, they don't want to face it, so they attack the messenger.
[01:56:31.749 --> 01:56:33.149]  And so that's all it is.
[01:56:33.249 --> 01:56:37.612]  It doesn't bother me, except that you can always hear it in their voice.
[01:56:37.652 --> 01:56:38.753]  You know what they're going to say.
[01:56:38.793 --> 01:56:40.534]  You know what they're going to do.
[01:56:40.554 --> 01:56:44.296]  And you know they're just going to run down a line of disinfo.
[01:56:44.496 --> 01:56:52.681]  Well, it does bother me because you have to take a half an hour or an hour a week and answer some foolishness just so that you can retain the listeners that you've got.
[01:56:52.781 --> 01:56:56.143]  Oh, so you've heard how I have to answer the same question, and they don't want it answered.
[01:56:56.733 --> 01:56:59.775]  They don't want an easily verifiable answer.
[01:57:00.476 --> 01:57:02.437]  They don't know how to judge a tree by its fruit either.
[01:57:03.078 --> 01:57:08.502]  Actually, the reason that I called in at the side issue... Go ahead and throw out your comment.
[01:57:08.522 --> 01:57:08.802]  Go ahead.
[01:57:08.902 --> 01:57:20.611]  It's actually with psyops exactly what we're speaking about, but I wanted to know your opinion about the subliminal part of that and how prevalent you think that is.
[01:57:21.494 --> 01:57:22.435]  Subliminal what?
[01:57:22.915 --> 01:57:23.436]  Diops.
[01:57:23.996 --> 01:57:25.918]  Yes, in media specifically.
[01:57:25.998 --> 01:57:26.539]  Sure, sure.
[01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:27.600]  I'll comment on that when we get back.
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:28.120]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.241]  More calls coming up.
[01:57:29.401 --> 01:57:30.842]  We'll get Dylan Avery on at the 8 after.
[01:57:30.882 --> 01:57:32.504]  Go ahead and get him on the horn.
[01:57:33.865 --> 01:57:37.768]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.889]  Or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.695 --> 01:57:50.335]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.995 --> 01:57:52.056]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.776 --> 01:57:53.876]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.537 --> 01:57:55.337]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.097 --> 01:57:57.078]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.678 --> 01:58:01.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:05.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.161 --> 01:58:09.563]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in...
[01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:17.556]  To hour number three on this live Thursday edition, the 19th day of January 2006.
[01:58:18.557 --> 01:58:33.391]  And for the next hour, we're going to be joined by somebody who didn't sit there and suck her thumb and whine and roll around in a fetal position like... No, somebody who actually got involved, engaged the New World Order at point-blank range...
[01:58:34.770 --> 01:58:35.671]  We're good to go.
[01:58:54.847 --> 01:58:59.990]  We'll go to Thomas and Alex and Mike and others that have been patiently holding toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:06.354]  But this is a little bit different of a 9-11 film from some of the others I've seen, different from mine.
[01:59:07.643 --> 01:59:08.203]  It's excellent.
[01:59:08.263 --> 01:59:09.464]  It's a different perspective.
[01:59:09.784 --> 01:59:12.344]  Just asking the key questions, question after question.
[01:59:12.364 --> 01:59:13.085]  Well, what about this?
[01:59:13.125 --> 01:59:13.685]  What about that?
[01:59:14.165 --> 01:59:18.366]  And then it answers the question for you if you've got a brain.
[01:59:19.046 --> 01:59:21.527]  And so I think it's very effective, and folks should get it.
[01:59:21.567 --> 01:59:22.367]  We're very, very honored.
[01:59:22.607 --> 01:59:23.748]  Dylan is very gracious, too.
[01:59:23.768 --> 01:59:28.569]  He let us post Loose Change 1 at prisonplanet.tv, and we put a link over to him where you can get it.
[01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:34.210]  But now we're now carrying Loose Change 2, and hopefully he'll let us put that up on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:59:34.651 --> 01:59:35.971]  Dylan, thank you for joining us.
[01:59:36.764 --> 01:59:37.984]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:59:38.044 --> 01:59:38.665]  It's good to be on.
[01:59:39.065 --> 01:59:39.405]  You bet.
[01:59:39.445 --> 01:59:41.666]  You know, you're just another success story.
[01:59:41.726 --> 01:59:47.067]  I had David Stahl on, who's a city manager, a retired police officer, but a city councilman.
[01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:49.688]  And he discovered the toll road tracking grid.
[01:59:49.708 --> 01:59:52.509]  He went public, and now it looks like we may be able to beat it.
[01:59:52.529 --> 01:59:55.830]  At least the majority of counties are joining us to say no to it.
[01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:59.931]  And you and a couple college students got together, did the research.
[01:59:59.971 --> 02:00:04.153]  You went off other documented research, did your own, and have done something very effective.
[02:00:04.193 --> 02:00:05.093]  You're effecting change.
[02:00:06.204 --> 02:00:07.025]  Well, I'm doing my best.
[02:00:08.145 --> 02:00:14.249]  Tell us about yourself before we get into the film and 9-11 and what you think is most important about it and take some calls on a host of issues.
[02:00:14.289 --> 02:00:15.830]  But tell us about your awakening.
[02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:16.650]  What woke you up?
[02:00:16.710 --> 02:00:17.751]  Why did you decide to do this?
[02:00:17.791 --> 02:00:18.371]  What was it like?
[02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:21.953]  Well, it was about three years ago in May 2002.
[02:00:22.534 --> 02:00:28.457]  I was building a restaurant that was basically funded by James Gandolfini who plays Tony Soprano on the HBO series Sopranos.
[02:00:29.078 --> 02:00:31.479]  And in May 2002, he came up for the opening party.
[02:00:31.959 --> 02:00:34.581]  I had a chance to speak with him after the party and he was... I...
[02:00:35.382 --> 02:00:45.265]  I was thinking about getting into the whole film industry, acting, directing, figuring out what I wanted to do, and I approached him, it was like 3 in the morning, and I was like, Jim, I just had a quick question.
[02:00:45.285 --> 02:00:46.565]  Is this whole acting thing worth it?
[02:00:47.246 --> 02:00:48.586]  And is it worth it?
[02:00:48.646 --> 02:00:50.467]  And he was like, well, not really, kid.
[02:00:50.867 --> 02:00:53.147]  So I was like, okay, well, how about directing?
[02:00:53.187 --> 02:00:58.469]  He's like, well, if you want to be a successful director, then you have to have something that you want to say to the world.
[02:00:59.153 --> 02:01:03.175]  So it was not, I mean, that night I started... That's good advice.
[02:01:03.215 --> 02:01:04.236]  You just got to do it.
[02:01:04.336 --> 02:01:05.897]  It doesn't even have to be perfect.
[02:01:05.917 --> 02:01:08.178]  You've done a great job, though, in the first thing you did.
[02:01:08.218 --> 02:01:14.881]  But, I mean, it's just sort of just talking and all these trendy prants around, have lots of film meetings, and that's not how you do it.
[02:01:14.901 --> 02:01:15.522]  You just do it.
[02:01:16.282 --> 02:01:20.004]  Yeah, well, like I said, man, I'm just a kid doing what I feel in my heart I need to do.
[02:01:20.965 --> 02:01:22.826]  Well, you're not a kid at 23, right?
[02:01:23.126 --> 02:01:25.147]  I mean, we had a lot of founding fathers that were that age.
[02:01:27.183 --> 02:01:27.563]  That's right.
[02:01:27.583 --> 02:01:28.123]  They were young.
[02:01:28.183 --> 02:01:28.504]  I forgot.
[02:01:28.524 --> 02:01:29.324]  No, you're not a kid.
[02:01:30.204 --> 02:01:34.446]  They tell us that we're kids until we're 30 now, so we never realize we're men when we're 13, 14.
[02:01:35.906 --> 02:01:38.627]  I'm still growing, so I can't say I'm a man yet, but I'm on my way.
[02:01:39.848 --> 02:01:46.070]  I say you're a man, a man who has beliefs, a man who gets involved, a man who takes action.
[02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:47.670]  You're doing a great job there, Dylan.
[02:01:48.511 --> 02:01:48.971]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:49.051 --> 02:01:49.771]  I really appreciate it.
[02:01:49.791 --> 02:01:50.131]  You bet.
[02:01:50.571 --> 02:01:55.213]  So he told you, this is riveting, he told you just have something you believe in, get involved.
[02:01:55.842 --> 02:01:57.763]  Yeah, just have something to say and stand behind it.
[02:01:57.863 --> 02:02:15.427]  So I took a couple different ideas that I had been toying with in the past and characters and kind of threw them all together and started writing a feature film script, which eventually turned into Loose Change the Movie, which was a semi-fictional story about me and my friends finding out that September 11th was basically an inside job.
[02:02:16.148 --> 02:02:17.328]  And commercial break?
[02:02:18.728 --> 02:02:20.069]  That is a commercial break.
[02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:22.449]  When we get back, we'll hear more about this.
[02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:25.050]  That's a seminal event.
[02:02:26.596 --> 02:02:28.218]  It was never even conscious of myself.
[02:02:28.238 --> 02:02:33.665]  I mean, I just was sick of all the lies and what was happening to our country 12 years ago.
[02:02:33.685 --> 02:02:35.547]  And so I just said, you know what, I'm going to get involved.
[02:02:36.469 --> 02:02:37.350]  And here we are today.
[02:02:38.271 --> 02:02:42.456]  Meanwhile, so many people never even live because they never get in the arena.
[02:02:46.693 --> 02:02:49.555]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.815 --> 02:02:50.496]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.596 --> 02:02:51.377]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.737 --> 02:02:56.400]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.741 --> 02:03:03.486]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.806 --> 02:03:05.787]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.987 --> 02:03:08.807]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.927 --> 02:03:13.589]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.789 --> 02:03:18.190]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:25.652]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.912 --> 02:03:28.312]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.493 --> 02:03:30.213]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:45.777 --> 02:03:49.238]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:49.518 --> 02:03:53.019]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:53.099 --> 02:03:57.060]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:03.441]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.841 --> 02:04:11.743]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:12.183 --> 02:04:17.508]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.668 --> 02:04:21.431]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.812 --> 02:04:23.653]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:23.713 --> 02:04:25.875]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[02:04:45.710 --> 02:04:49.011]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:04:49.331 --> 02:04:54.633]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:04:54.874 --> 02:04:56.754]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.
[02:04:57.055 --> 02:05:01.617]  Vitamir has created unique and natural patented formulas that set them apart from any other oral hygiene products.
[02:05:01.817 --> 02:05:08.219]  The folks at Vitamir have blended zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and clove oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath and fight gum disease.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:09.420]  Good health starts in your mouth.
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:18.785]  And regular use of Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash is a powerful front line of defense against gingivitis, bleeding gums, and folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just-from-the-dentist-office feeling.
[02:05:19.005 --> 02:05:22.347]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.
[02:05:22.607 --> 02:05:22.807]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:22.827 --> 02:05:23.027]  That's 677-817-9829.
[02:05:23.047 --> 02:05:24.908]  And order Vitamir mouthwash and toothpaste today.
[02:05:25.108 --> 02:05:25.789]  He'll be glad you did.
[02:05:25.809 --> 02:05:27.409]  And so will that special someone in your life.
[02:05:32.572 --> 02:05:33.333]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:33.373 --> 02:05:34.714]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.002 --> 02:05:58.845]  Some film students, college students got together, put it together.
[02:05:58.905 --> 02:05:59.565]  It's excellent.
[02:05:59.886 --> 02:06:01.927]  We're carrying it at Infowars.com.
[02:06:02.368 --> 02:06:10.255]  September 11th was not a surprise attack on America, but rather a cold and calculated genocide by our own government.
[02:06:10.335 --> 02:06:11.076]  Question mark.
[02:06:11.636 --> 02:06:12.057]  What if?
[02:06:12.737 --> 02:06:18.502]  We were told that the Twin Towers were hit by commercial airliners and subsequently brought down by jet fuel.
[02:06:18.943 --> 02:06:21.605]  We were told that the Pentagon was hit by a Boeing 777.
[02:06:22.845 --> 02:06:26.328]  We were told that the Flight 93 crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:34.296]  We were told that 19 Arabs from halfway across the globe acting under the orders from Osama Bin Laden were responsible.
[02:06:35.437 --> 02:06:43.445]  What you will see inside will prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that everything you know about 9-11 is a complete fabrication.
[02:06:44.105 --> 02:06:45.126]  Conspiracy theory?
[02:06:45.186 --> 02:06:46.848]  It's not a theory if you can prove it.
[02:06:47.857 --> 02:07:03.962]  And that's a Louder Than Words production, loose change, second edition, written and directed by Dylan Avery, produced by Corey Rowe, and of course there's a lot of other great folks involved in this, and we carry it again at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:07:03.982 --> 02:07:05.883]  You can get yourself a hard copy of it.
[02:07:06.343 --> 02:07:08.564]  Dylan, you were talking about how back in 2002,
[02:07:10.683 --> 02:07:23.894]  You are working at a local restaurant, building a local restaurant for the star of the Sopranos there in your town, and then you go talk to the head guy and you say, like three in the morning, hey, what do I do to get involved and break into acting?
[02:07:23.934 --> 02:07:26.276]  I'm just recapping for those who didn't hear it in the last segment.
[02:07:27.357 --> 02:07:28.398]  He goes, yeah, it's not worth it.
[02:07:28.418 --> 02:07:29.319]  You go, what about directing?
[02:07:29.359 --> 02:07:31.501]  He says, have something you believe in, stand behind it,
[02:07:32.279 --> 02:07:32.840]  We're good to go.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:33.120]  I think?
[02:07:54.770 --> 02:08:02.174]  Well, I guess I subconsciously knew that something was wrong with the official story because in the first maybe 10, 20 pages I started touching upon it.
[02:08:02.814 --> 02:08:09.478]  And when I started to really research 9-11, I came across, I believe it was two key websites.
[02:08:09.538 --> 02:08:17.162]  It was Serendipity's World Trade Center and the so-called War on Terror, I believe, and Blake Puppy Archive.
[02:08:17.202 --> 02:08:21.425]  And a lot of people were posting videos of the collapses and just pointing things out.
[02:08:21.465 --> 02:08:23.646]  And it was at that point that I really started to realize that
[02:08:24.136 --> 02:08:29.921]  Maybe what I was writing wasn't so much fiction as it was reality.
[02:08:29.941 --> 02:08:33.384]  You basically hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[02:08:33.464 --> 02:08:42.112]  I had too much information to put into an actual feature-length film, so I split it off and basically made Loose Change the documentary.
[02:08:42.792 --> 02:08:45.054]  People ask me all the time, where did you get the title Loose Change?
[02:08:45.274 --> 02:08:45.915]  Why Loose Change?
[02:08:45.955 --> 02:08:47.136]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:08:47.156 --> 02:08:51.800]  It's like, well, the reason the documentary is called that is because of the movie that it all started from.
[02:08:52.447 --> 02:08:55.669]  And if all goes according to plan, we'll be shooting Loose Change, the movie, this year.
[02:08:57.250 --> 02:09:10.219]  Well, I think, you know, the term Loose Change, it just makes you think of unanswered questions or loose things, you know, parts of things that are just wrong or parts of things that are jingling around in your pocket.
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:12.280]  Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:14.282]  People hear Loose Change and they automatically think of money.
[02:09:15.503 --> 02:09:20.506]  Well, I think that's obviously what we're... So Loose Change in the film is going to mean something different?
[02:09:22.416 --> 02:09:23.677]  No, it's the same meaning.
[02:09:23.737 --> 02:09:25.418]  It means lose change.
[02:09:25.538 --> 02:09:28.100]  This is what has to happen, and we're doing our part.
[02:09:29.581 --> 02:09:34.185]  So really it's a way of saying unanswered questions, things that are still running wild out there.
[02:09:34.205 --> 02:09:37.247]  Yeah, things that have to be done if we want to change this country.
[02:09:38.688 --> 02:09:39.829]  Well, that's certainly true.
[02:09:39.909 --> 02:09:44.453]  Now, this second edition, why don't you tell folks what it goes through and describe it for them?
[02:09:46.354 --> 02:09:47.115]  Well, basically the...
[02:09:47.805 --> 02:09:58.747]  The main chapters of the film are, as you described earlier, the opening timeline of the movie, which replaced the whole pod slash missile thing from Loose Change 1.
[02:09:58.867 --> 02:10:01.947]  Loose Change 2nd Edition opens up with an opening timeline.
[02:10:02.868 --> 02:10:06.448]  Majority of the research I used was from Kiltown's website.
[02:10:06.468 --> 02:10:08.088]  I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with Kiltown.
[02:10:08.108 --> 02:10:10.669]  He's an amazing, amazing 9-11 researcher.
[02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:12.769]  If you haven't seen his site, you should definitely check it out.
[02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:16.950]  And basically...
[02:10:18.412 --> 02:10:19.753]  I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought there.
[02:10:20.954 --> 02:10:22.635]  I understand, and you're also on cell phone.
[02:10:22.675 --> 02:10:28.520]  This is kind of a short notice interview, so you're kind of out on the job while doing this interview.
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:39.469]  We're going to take some calls coming up in a few minutes, but tell me about the team that made these two documentaries, because they're both excellent, but Loose Change 2, obviously, I think is a lot better.
[02:10:40.831 --> 02:10:44.794]  I mean, how long it took you to do it, how you did your research, what you decided to cover?
[02:10:46.399 --> 02:10:53.122]  I tried to stick to the main key points that I could prove, basically, because there's so much about 9-11.
[02:10:53.142 --> 02:10:56.684]  You cannot put everything about 9-11 into a single documentary.
[02:10:56.704 --> 02:11:04.627]  You're not going to make a 9-11 documentary that makes everybody happy, because everybody believes that this piece is important and this piece... Exactly.
[02:11:04.667 --> 02:11:10.110]  I've made three films about it, written a book, published a book, done hundreds of radio shows and thousands of interviews about it.
[02:11:10.848 --> 02:11:11.368]  Exactly.
[02:11:11.868 --> 02:11:12.748]  Why didn't you put in this?
[02:11:12.808 --> 02:11:14.169]  And why didn't you put in John O'Neill?
[02:11:14.249 --> 02:11:16.749]  It's like, I mean, I can't include everything.
[02:11:17.429 --> 02:11:30.071]  But again, there's those people who've never gotten off the bench, don't even understand what video editing software is, and they just go, why didn't you just make it like this?
[02:11:30.091 --> 02:11:32.472]  So I would just ignore that type of stuff.
[02:11:33.292 --> 02:11:34.312]  I mean, that's routine.
[02:11:34.432 --> 02:11:39.093]  Armchair quarterbacks who've never been on the field going, why didn't he make that pass?
[02:11:39.133 --> 02:11:39.553]  You know, it's...
[02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:41.800]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:50.744]  I mean, like I said, I've tried to stick to the things that were the most solid pieces of evidence, and what I did for the second edition is I tried to take the first one.
[02:11:50.784 --> 02:12:09.774]  I mean, I basically, right after releasing the first one, I knew that it was incomplete, and I knew that there were automatically things that people were not going to like and things that I had to fix, and slowly offers began pouring in for people that wanted to help, people that wanted to, like I said, the first contribution I got, which was key, which was Ryan Dinan, who did the
[02:12:10.336 --> 02:12:13.779]  ...animation of Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon, which was phenomenal.
[02:12:13.819 --> 02:12:15.140]  I mean, he did an outstanding job.
[02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:20.244]  This man's got a full-time job and a family, and still managed to bang that out for me.
[02:12:20.284 --> 02:12:21.885]  And again, he did an outstanding job.
[02:12:22.406 --> 02:12:27.710]  So it started with that, and then I started taking some points from the first loose change, like the hijackers.
[02:12:27.810 --> 02:12:31.473]  People emailed me constantly asking, well, where did you get that information on the hijackers?
[02:12:31.913 --> 02:12:33.975]  So I went a lot more in-depth into that.
[02:12:34.035 --> 02:12:36.617]  I had key quotes from each hijacker, each article...
[02:12:37.113 --> 02:12:37.693]  Yeah, basically.
[02:12:37.713 --> 02:12:38.434]  We tried to take
[02:13:06.067 --> 02:13:14.912]  The best suggestions that we got, and we also tried to include things that I originally wanted to include in the first, I just didn't have the time and the resources, like Operation Northwoods.
[02:13:14.992 --> 02:13:17.193]  I mean, that originally opened up the documentary.
[02:13:17.253 --> 02:13:23.857]  I had this whole timeline, but it started going off course, and I started including things that weren't exactly relevant.
[02:13:23.937 --> 02:13:26.939]  So I figured I would just put that aside and come back to it at a later date.
[02:13:27.539 --> 02:13:29.080]  And that's what I did for the second edition.
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:33.862]  I start with Northwoods, and then I go to the controlled impact demonstration that NASA did in 1984.
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:44.460]  All the warnings that the government got, basically it's a much better lead-in to virgins to 9-11 who have no idea what they're about to get themselves into.
[02:13:45.249 --> 02:13:49.831]  Yeah, they've been beta testing and oiling this and preparing it for many years.
[02:13:49.871 --> 02:13:53.952]  When you really start looking at it, it is totally obvious who did this.
[02:13:54.712 --> 02:13:55.533]  It's massive.
[02:13:55.773 --> 02:13:56.513]  It is massive.
[02:13:56.553 --> 02:13:59.974]  You know, people always say, hey, something this big, they get caught.
[02:14:00.614 --> 02:14:01.475]  People will speak out.
[02:14:01.515 --> 02:14:02.495]  They have spoken out.
[02:14:02.535 --> 02:14:06.116]  I mean, it is what I call an orgy of evidence.
[02:14:06.236 --> 02:14:07.697]  It is ridiculous.
[02:14:08.357 --> 02:14:15.301]  Well, number one, the official story is totally impossible, a complete joke, an absolute 110% fraud.
[02:14:15.441 --> 02:14:20.244]  Every part of it is demonstrably a lie and manufactured and deceptive.
[02:14:20.264 --> 02:14:21.064]  That's number one.
[02:14:21.624 --> 02:14:26.367]  And of course they had prior knowledge and all of that they tried to deny is now public knowledge and admit it.
[02:14:28.043 --> 02:14:29.665]  Then you look at who the hijackers are.
[02:14:29.705 --> 02:14:30.986]  They're clearly government agents.
[02:14:31.046 --> 02:14:32.468]  They're clearly being trained at U.S.
[02:14:32.488 --> 02:14:33.249]  military bases.
[02:14:33.509 --> 02:14:34.890]  They're clearly being protected.
[02:14:35.211 --> 02:14:37.493]  Then you look at NORAD standing down.
[02:14:37.573 --> 02:14:40.276]  You look at the public officials being warned not to fly.
[02:14:40.296 --> 02:14:41.718]  You look at the insider trading.
[02:14:41.958 --> 02:14:43.439]  You look at the bombs in the buildings.
[02:14:43.459 --> 02:14:44.380]  You look at all of it.
[02:14:45.301 --> 02:14:46.743]  It's pretty conclusive, Dylan.
[02:14:47.708 --> 02:14:48.668]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:50.669]  And I got one of those the other day.
[02:14:50.689 --> 02:14:58.732]  People were like, well, you know, when you get to conspiracy theories like this, it's like there's, especially with something like 9-11, there's so many people that were involved.
[02:14:58.912 --> 02:15:00.592]  How have they not come out?
[02:15:01.513 --> 02:15:03.293]  I mean, there's a number of reasons why they wouldn't have.
[02:15:03.353 --> 02:15:07.715]  I mean, if you work for a government that killed 3,000 people, I mean, you probably fear for your own life as well.
[02:15:08.614 --> 02:15:10.415]  Well, look, a lot of them have gone public.
[02:15:10.715 --> 02:15:15.538]  I mean, again, the defense language school dean said, I trained some of the hijackers.
[02:15:15.878 --> 02:15:16.999]  They were here at my school.
[02:15:17.019 --> 02:15:17.839]  They're government ops.
[02:15:17.859 --> 02:15:18.760]  The government did it.
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.120]  It was in the San Jose Mercury News.
[02:15:20.361 --> 02:15:21.801]  They told him to shut up and threaten me.
[02:15:22.442 --> 02:15:23.982]  I mean, a bunch of people went public.
[02:15:24.003 --> 02:15:25.203]  How many FBI agents?
[02:15:25.243 --> 02:15:25.603]  How many?
[02:15:26.144 --> 02:15:32.347]  John O'Neill said, and he died on 9-11, he told British TV, he said they're going to stage an attack.
[02:15:33.267 --> 02:15:37.150]  He said they're going to let an attack take place as a way to invade Afghanistan.
[02:15:37.190 --> 02:15:37.790]  And what happened?
[02:15:38.813 --> 02:15:39.554]  Exactly that.
[02:15:41.535 --> 02:15:42.236]  It's amazing.
[02:15:42.336 --> 02:15:50.121]  Dylan, we're about to break, but in the minute and a half we've got, what are some of the other things you want to talk about when we get back?
[02:15:52.202 --> 02:15:53.683]  I'm really up for anything right now, Alex.
[02:15:53.743 --> 02:15:54.804]  I have to apologize today.
[02:15:54.864 --> 02:16:00.088]  I am under an enormous amount of stress, so this interview is probably not under the best of circumstances.
[02:16:00.148 --> 02:16:00.708]  I just really have...
[02:16:01.497 --> 02:16:13.071]  Yeah, I've heard on other shows you do sound a bit frazzled on this one.
[02:16:13.671 --> 02:16:14.492]  Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
[02:16:14.532 --> 02:16:15.614]  I'm under a lot of stress lately.
[02:16:15.634 --> 02:16:17.916]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:16:17.976 --> 02:16:18.437]  Well, you know what?
[02:16:18.457 --> 02:16:19.979]  You just got to relax and enjoy it.
[02:16:20.627 --> 02:16:23.291]  Yeah, I'm doing my best, man.
[02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:24.232]  Believe me, I'm trying.
[02:16:24.593 --> 02:16:27.316]  Yeah, well, you've taken a big load on yourself.
[02:16:27.977 --> 02:16:29.820]  Was I correct in saying you're 23 years old?
[02:16:30.381 --> 02:16:31.322]  I'm 22, actually.
[02:16:31.342 --> 02:16:31.322]  22?
[02:16:31.582 --> 02:16:32.003]  Yeah.
[02:16:33.885 --> 02:16:36.229]  So I guess when you first started getting involved, you were 20 or 19?
[02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:38.661]  18, actually.
[02:16:38.681 --> 02:16:38.661]  18?
[02:16:38.902 --> 02:16:41.965]  Because I just turned 22 this past November.
[02:16:42.305 --> 02:16:44.828]  Yeah, well, there are people out there who say, well, some kids made this.
[02:16:44.848 --> 02:16:45.989]  I don't want to hear from them.
[02:16:46.890 --> 02:16:49.032]  The old Bible verse, out of the mouths of babes.
[02:16:49.293 --> 02:16:58.663]  But more than that, you just went out and looked at all the research by all these incredible physicists and underwriters and all the experts, and you guys did a great job of compiling it.
[02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:02.946]  Yeah, and that's the other thing, is that people accuse us of, like, stealing other people's research.
[02:17:02.966 --> 02:17:04.286]  It's like, we're not stealing it.
[02:17:04.686 --> 02:17:08.228]  We're not, we're not, I mean, I'm not claiming to do anything extraordinary.
[02:17:08.308 --> 02:17:09.509]  You even give people credit.
[02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:15.691]  That's what's nuts about some of these, quote, researchers is that, is that, oh, you link to me, or you, you know, you use my stuff.
[02:17:15.731 --> 02:17:16.252]  How dare you?
[02:17:16.272 --> 02:17:19.973]  Well, we're trying to stop a bunch of killers from doing more, folks.
[02:17:21.824 --> 02:17:23.986]  But, you know, you've just got to ignore those egomaniacs.
[02:17:24.006 --> 02:17:29.491]  There's not many of them out there, but a lot of them are trying to just control the movement and everything and try to limit its scope.
[02:17:29.531 --> 02:17:33.475]  I think it's great to have a wide debate, look at all the evidence, flesh it out.
[02:17:34.336 --> 02:17:35.737]  Dylan, stay there.
[02:17:35.797 --> 02:17:38.340]  Let's come back and take a bunch of calls on the other side.
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:42.824]  And, folks, if you want loose change, it's on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:17:42.864 --> 02:17:43.645]  Get your hard copy.
[02:17:45.788 --> 02:17:49.791]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[02:17:50.231 --> 02:17:53.693]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[02:17:54.153 --> 02:17:57.375]  Cardavite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[02:17:57.776 --> 02:18:02.359]  Made from seven herbs, cardavite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[02:18:02.379 --> 02:18:04.340]  Here's what one person has to say.
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:08.363]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[02:18:08.503 --> 02:18:12.326]  I don't have the tightness of my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[02:18:12.546 --> 02:18:13.747]  I tried all kinds of junk.
[02:18:13.947 --> 02:18:14.448]  It didn't do.
[02:18:14.548 --> 02:18:16.569]  The only thing that worked was your cardiovite.
[02:18:16.949 --> 02:18:19.291]  If you believe cardiovite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.
[02:18:19.331 --> 02:18:19.772]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[02:19:45.942 --> 02:19:47.563]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:47.703 --> 02:19:51.786]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:51.946 --> 02:19:54.808]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:54.888 --> 02:20:01.593]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:04.796]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:04.997 --> 02:20:07.379]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:07.539 --> 02:20:17.670]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:20:21.891 --> 02:20:26.993]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:20:27.153 --> 02:20:34.896]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black Berkey purification elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:34.916 --> 02:20:35.376]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:35.416 --> 02:20:37.117]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:20:45.894 --> 02:20:52.782]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:20:52.922 --> 02:21:05.856]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:06.036 --> 02:21:07.818]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:07.978 --> 02:21:08.418]  We're good to go.
[02:21:08.438 --> 02:21:08.958]  We're good to go.
[02:21:35.348 --> 02:21:36.469]  We're good to go.
[02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:10.108]  Dylan Avery.
[02:22:10.328 --> 02:22:11.508]  I was talking to him during the break.
[02:22:11.568 --> 02:22:12.509]  It sounds like my life.
[02:22:12.549 --> 02:22:18.812]  He's dealing with DVD manufacturers, not delivering stuff on time, shipping stuff out, the nightmare of it.
[02:22:18.832 --> 02:22:21.834]  I remember doing it out of my house many years ago, and that's the point he's at.
[02:22:22.154 --> 02:22:26.896]  Trying to edit and make films while you're doing it, trying to answer hundreds of emails and faxes.
[02:22:26.936 --> 02:22:27.676]  It's a lot of fun.
[02:22:28.057 --> 02:22:31.098]  And so I know the mode that Dylan's in.
[02:22:31.198 --> 02:22:32.419]  It's fun to be in the arena.
[02:22:33.099 --> 02:22:34.300]  These callers will be all over the map.
[02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:36.942]  They've been holding for eons, but it all ties back into the same stuff.
[02:22:36.963 --> 02:22:37.863]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:22:38.284 --> 02:22:40.966]  Thomas in Florida, you're on the air with Dylan Avery and Alex Jones.
[02:22:41.006 --> 02:22:41.526]  Welcome, sir.
[02:22:42.287 --> 02:22:43.008]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:43.608 --> 02:22:45.850]  It's a given that we appreciate you.
[02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:47.351]  I'll make this quick.
[02:22:47.411 --> 02:22:54.157]  This is a little off the mark, what you're talking about today, but yesterday I went in to get a regular physical for my insurance.
[02:22:54.577 --> 02:23:05.382]  And I'm sitting in the lobby and surrounded by books and things up on the wall talking about flu vaccine, get this vaccine, vaccine yourself.
[02:23:05.723 --> 02:23:07.804]  And I go back in the back and they take my blood.
[02:23:09.111 --> 02:23:12.595]  And I'm still sitting there with the deal in my arm where they pulled it out and the nurse leaves.
[02:23:12.635 --> 02:23:16.358]  And she comes back in and she's got this syringe full of something.
[02:23:16.699 --> 02:23:17.960]  And she goes to start putting it in my arm.
[02:23:17.980 --> 02:23:18.981]  I said, what are you doing?
[02:23:19.001 --> 02:23:20.142]  What are you putting in my arm?
[02:23:20.482 --> 02:23:26.928]  And she said, well, this is something we're going to be able to tell about your blood from now on of anything that's going on in your body.
[02:23:27.189 --> 02:23:28.210]  And I said, well, what's in it?
[02:23:28.730 --> 02:23:30.111]  And she said, well, it won't hurt you.
[02:23:30.131 --> 02:23:30.571]  It's safe.
[02:23:30.611 --> 02:23:31.131]  Trust it.
[02:23:31.191 --> 02:23:32.832]  She wouldn't even tell you what it was?
[02:23:32.852 --> 02:23:35.553]  She couldn't tell me what it was.
[02:23:35.973 --> 02:23:38.554]  And then I said, well, you're not putting that in my arm.
[02:23:38.795 --> 02:23:42.156]  And she brings the doctor back there, and he couldn't even tell me what was in it.
[02:23:43.397 --> 02:23:45.017]  Well, sir, what were you there for?
[02:23:45.057 --> 02:23:46.278]  Was it a big city clinic?
[02:23:47.298 --> 02:23:48.459]  It was right up here in Sarasota.
[02:23:49.379 --> 02:23:57.062]  Just for my regular physical, for my insurance, which I have good health, and I'm blessed with that, and just for my standards.
[02:23:57.082 --> 02:24:02.324]  Then we're going to put some kind of trait... Folks, this is what's getting crazy, is that I get reports of this all the time.
[02:24:02.364 --> 02:24:12.107]  They know the general public's dumbed down, and so they're doing... Again, we've had a government 3,000-plus times declassified use chemical, biologicals, and radiologicals on the American people.
[02:24:12.836 --> 02:24:20.563]  I mean, again, Israel radiated 110,000 of their own children, killed them for $3 billion from the U.S., you know, up until the 60s.
[02:24:21.103 --> 02:24:23.906]  Just type in, Israel radiated its own children.
[02:24:23.926 --> 02:24:24.586]  It'll pop up.
[02:24:24.626 --> 02:24:26.007]  Mainstream news, Israel.
[02:24:26.428 --> 02:24:33.154]  The same governments that admittedly have done all this in the past now want us to totally trust them and, oh, they wouldn't be behind terror.
[02:24:33.414 --> 02:24:34.855]  Dylan Avery, you want to comment on this?
[02:24:36.917 --> 02:24:40.400]  Well, actually, I was reading up on Mumia Abu-Jamal earlier, actually.
[02:24:40.971 --> 02:24:45.575]  I don't know if you know about him, but what happened to him happened back in the 1980s.
[02:24:46.696 --> 02:24:59.306]  Basically, this guy was a journalist, and he was a cab driver at night to pay his bills, and he was letting off a fare at like 2 or 3 in the morning, and he looks out his car window, and he sees his brother in the street.
[02:24:59.346 --> 02:25:00.386]  His brother got shot.
[02:25:00.987 --> 02:25:03.489]  And Mumia ran out there to check on his brother, and then...
[02:25:03.996 --> 02:25:05.497]  He got jumped or something.
[02:25:05.517 --> 02:25:06.377]  He lost consciousness.
[02:25:06.437 --> 02:25:09.259]  And when he woke up, the officer and his brother were dead.
[02:25:09.779 --> 02:25:11.900]  And then Mumia got picked up by an ambulance.
[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:13.861]  It took like a half hour to get to the hospital.
[02:25:14.401 --> 02:25:17.743]  And basically what ended up happening is he got framed for the officer's death.
[02:25:18.363 --> 02:25:20.264]  And he's been in jail since 1983.
[02:25:21.465 --> 02:25:23.106]  And this was back in the 1980s.
[02:25:23.146 --> 02:25:29.849]  I mean, this innocent black journalist in Philadelphia got framed for a brother and a police officer's murder.
[02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:31.410]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:25:32.944 --> 02:25:36.306]  There is so much bizarre stuff going on and happening.
[02:25:36.346 --> 02:25:41.209]  But, I mean, all the stories of poor people going to the health department and get sterilized.
[02:25:41.269 --> 02:25:47.192]  I mean, that happened to, what, 400 and something thousand women from the 1920s until 1980s.
[02:25:47.532 --> 02:25:48.353]  We've had them on.
[02:25:49.033 --> 02:25:52.155]  And so, is this the city health department?
[02:25:52.175 --> 02:25:55.597]  Did you go into some old city hospital to have this checkup?
[02:25:55.657 --> 02:25:57.117]  Where were you when they were doing this?
[02:25:57.498 --> 02:26:01.640]  This was in a high-end, you know, this is a high-end area down here anyway.
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:03.961]  Okay, so this was in a private clinic.
[02:26:04.081 --> 02:26:08.865]  This was in a private clinic for expensive insurance that I have.
[02:26:09.045 --> 02:26:11.346]  And I've never made any claims, but here, it gets better.
[02:26:11.547 --> 02:26:13.088]  But you did say no to the shot.
[02:26:13.348 --> 02:26:20.733]  I said no, and when he couldn't tell me, they come back and say, well, we cannot honor your insurance unless you take this.
[02:26:21.528 --> 02:26:23.168]  And, you know, I said, well, I'm leaving then.
[02:26:23.689 --> 02:26:27.190]  And when they started opening the door, they were walking me out.
[02:26:27.210 --> 02:26:31.351]  So when I got in the lobby, I sat there and said, you see all this stuff to the people that were there?
[02:26:31.371 --> 02:26:33.751]  I said, you see all this stuff about vaccines on the wall?
[02:26:34.151 --> 02:26:36.072]  I asked the guy, the doctor was still behind me.
[02:26:36.132 --> 02:26:39.073]  I said, have you told everybody how much mercury is in these vaccines?
[02:26:39.433 --> 02:26:41.373]  His face got blood red.
[02:26:41.433 --> 02:26:44.274]  He turned over there to the receptionist and said, call the police.
[02:26:44.778 --> 02:26:48.119]  You know, I told him he was a piece of crap when they were throwing me out the front door.
[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:50.480]  Well, good, you don't need their trashy insurance.
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:52.201]  Folks, I hear about this all the time.
[02:26:52.441 --> 02:26:58.724]  Listen, local news gets on, it happens nationwide, a month before school and says, you must take vaccines or you'll be arrested.
[02:26:58.944 --> 02:26:59.924]  There's no law!
[02:27:00.364 --> 02:27:08.788]  Listen, next summer, when you are watching it on TV, I don't care if you live in Albuquerque or in New York or Austin, and you're going to see it on every channel, it's the law, you'll be arrested.
[02:27:09.497 --> 02:27:10.658]  Call up and go, what's that law?
[02:27:10.678 --> 02:27:12.319]  And the news will go, we were just told to say this.
[02:27:12.539 --> 02:27:13.720]  There's not even a law!
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:17.443]  And sir, the story you're telling, I'm getting all the time.
[02:27:18.083 --> 02:27:21.526]  You just go to the doctor and we've got an injection for you.
[02:27:21.586 --> 02:27:22.186]  Well, what is that?
[02:27:22.987 --> 02:27:25.648]  You need to get out of here right now, boy.
[02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:28.971]  Because the drug companies are giving them money to do this.
[02:27:29.011 --> 02:27:32.573]  I mean, it's just... Oh my gosh.
[02:27:32.774 --> 02:27:33.434]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.936 --> 02:27:36.876]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.337 --> 02:27:38.838]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:42.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.241 --> 02:27:52.602]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.822 --> 02:27:57.824]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.164 --> 02:28:06.045]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.225 --> 02:28:13.267]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:13.487 --> 02:28:14.688]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:14.848 --> 02:28:18.230]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:20.971]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:28:21.172 --> 02:28:27.995]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:28:33.762 --> 02:28:34.724]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:45.856 --> 02:28:47.477]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.617 --> 02:28:51.720]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:54.742]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.802 --> 02:29:01.526]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.706 --> 02:29:04.708]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.928 --> 02:29:07.310]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:12.153]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.333 --> 02:29:17.595]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:29:17.776 --> 02:29:18.536]  MTBE.
[02:29:18.756 --> 02:29:19.556]  Radon 222.
[02:29:19.656 --> 02:29:21.637]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[02:29:21.797 --> 02:29:26.900]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:33.743]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:29:36.664 --> 02:29:37.064]  803-4438.
[02:29:37.124 --> 02:29:37.925]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.945 --> 02:29:43.647]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:45.408 --> 02:29:46.508]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:29:46.828 --> 02:29:48.629]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:29:48.649 --> 02:29:50.170]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:50.570]  Yes.
[02:29:50.850 --> 02:29:51.690]  You neglect me.
[02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:53.851]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:29:55.672 --> 02:29:56.692]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:29:57.012 --> 02:29:57.893]  I'm getting sick.
[02:29:58.233 --> 02:30:00.394]  One of these days, I'm just going to give up.
[02:30:01.454 --> 02:30:01.935]  Wait a minute.
[02:30:02.015 --> 02:30:03.615]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:30:03.876 --> 02:30:12.440]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:18.363]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:30:18.603 --> 02:30:20.984]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:30:21.124 --> 02:30:25.807]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[02:30:26.027 --> 02:30:27.688]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:30:27.868 --> 02:30:31.190]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:35.753]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:35.813 --> 02:30:37.134]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:30:37.154 --> 02:30:37.894]  We don't need no education.
[02:30:55.210 --> 02:31:07.162]  We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teacher leave them kids alone
[02:31:23.363 --> 02:31:31.306]  Folks, I have no way of verifying what that caller just told us, but I'm going to ask him to send us an email detailing it with names and everything.
[02:31:31.326 --> 02:31:32.806]  I will try to investigate it.
[02:31:33.987 --> 02:31:34.707]  But I know this.
[02:31:34.807 --> 02:31:42.910]  All over the country, again, I mean, GIs over and over again would go in and they'd go, Oh, free health care for your children.
[02:31:42.990 --> 02:31:45.651]  And our government would just put little kids in a chamber and kill them.
[02:31:46.071 --> 02:31:46.911]  Your kid's dead.
[02:31:47.751 --> 02:31:48.772]  That's Time Magazine.
[02:31:48.792 --> 02:31:49.992]  They'll just calmly report it.
[02:31:50.272 --> 02:31:51.993]  Pregnant wives go in to have babies.
[02:31:52.933 --> 02:31:59.055]  Back, you know, to the trips, and they'd give them uranium, plutonium pills, and tell them, now, if you don't feel good taking these vitamins, come right in here.
[02:31:59.435 --> 02:32:04.637]  And they'd have doctors on standby with film cameras rolling just to see how the baby died.
[02:32:05.237 --> 02:32:05.917]  Oh, don't believe me?
[02:32:06.017 --> 02:32:09.778]  I mean, I have this thing where talk show hosts, when I'm doing an interview, don't believe me?
[02:32:09.858 --> 02:32:12.179]  I'm not a betting man, but I'll go, 10 grand right now.
[02:32:12.339 --> 02:32:13.079]  Come on, 10 grand!
[02:32:13.099 --> 02:32:14.640]  10 grand, don't believe me?
[02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:17.501]  Don't believe me that Israel radiated 110,000 children?
[02:32:19.793 --> 02:32:20.554]  I mean, it's that simple.
[02:32:33.935 --> 02:32:38.176]  I mean, you see, you want to know why I freak out, why I'm always going wild?
[02:32:38.236 --> 02:32:42.237]  Because, I mean, I'm just a bunch of psychopathic killers running everything right in front of us.
[02:32:42.877 --> 02:32:48.058]  And I know, I mean, the black men in Tuskegee, they'd go in, they'd have syphilis, they'd let them die of it over 40, 50 years.
[02:32:48.478 --> 02:32:50.879]  Now the evidence shows they were giving them syphilis.
[02:32:50.919 --> 02:32:51.919]  Imagine, poor black men.
[02:32:52.339 --> 02:32:53.799]  I'm going in to see the doctor.
[02:32:54.299 --> 02:32:56.600]  You're in Alabama, and you go in and...
[02:32:57.225 --> 02:32:57.925]  Hello, doctor.
[02:32:57.945 --> 02:32:58.705]  I appreciate your help.
[02:32:58.765 --> 02:33:01.406]  And that doctor's like, yes, we'll take care of you here.
[02:33:03.266 --> 02:33:05.427]  Now you'll... I mean, it's so sick.
[02:33:05.747 --> 02:33:08.028]  And everybody just wants to be a bunch of naive idiots.
[02:33:08.208 --> 02:33:09.288]  What's wrong with us?
[02:33:09.548 --> 02:33:12.029]  I'm not a brain sheep in a pen that's going to take it.
[02:33:13.889 --> 02:33:17.330]  And, yeah, I've talked to people who go in, and they'll just really push these shots on you.
[02:33:17.350 --> 02:33:19.170]  They're putting all kinds of weird stuff in them.
[02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.171]  The doctors won't even ask what it is.
[02:33:21.191 --> 02:33:22.471]  They're just getting some bounty.
[02:33:22.911 --> 02:33:25.372]  And believe me, these insurance companies are the worst.
[02:33:25.532 --> 02:33:25.792]  And I...
[02:33:27.388 --> 02:33:34.872]  I mean, Bill and Avery, do you ever just get totally flipped out like I do just by how crazy everything that's admitted is?
[02:33:35.633 --> 02:33:36.854]  Yeah, all the time.
[02:33:36.874 --> 02:33:40.576]  That's why I try to take a break now and try to keep myself somewhat sane.
[02:33:40.596 --> 02:33:44.198]  I mean, it really is insane.
[02:33:44.218 --> 02:33:54.664]  I mean, when you know that, I mean, folks, they'll take our troops and put them out in the field and fly over and nerve gas them and just kill them.
[02:33:55.587 --> 02:34:00.850]  Over and over again, and it can be in the BBC, and it's just, oh, government kills you.
[02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:01.531]  Trust them, though.
[02:34:01.551 --> 02:34:03.472]  They're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:34:03.532 --> 02:34:05.393]  Man, Iran's a real threat.
[02:34:07.335 --> 02:34:07.875]  Yeah, right.
[02:34:09.816 --> 02:34:16.640]  Alex, you need to have Corey on your show sometime, because he was in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he would have tons of things to tell you about the war.
[02:34:16.941 --> 02:34:18.782]  He's one of the guys that worked on the film.
[02:34:19.222 --> 02:34:20.183]  Yeah, tell us about Corey.
[02:34:20.763 --> 02:34:23.625]  Corey, well, he and I have been friends for...
[02:34:24.574 --> 02:34:25.435]  Basically forever.
[02:34:25.455 --> 02:34:28.416]  Not our entire lives, but we're definitely best friends.
[02:34:28.436 --> 02:34:30.077]  Soul brothers!
[02:34:30.717 --> 02:34:31.598]  Yeah, basically.
[02:34:32.698 --> 02:34:36.681]  We ran into each other when we started doing a paper route together, and we've been best friends ever since.
[02:34:37.641 --> 02:34:44.365]  Back in August 2001, Corey enlisted to the Army, and his first day of basic training was September 11, 2001.
[02:34:45.185 --> 02:34:48.067]  And within two or three months, he was in Afghanistan.
[02:34:48.887 --> 02:34:50.588]  And then when he was in Afghanistan...
[02:34:51.027 --> 02:34:51.748]  He emailed me.
[02:34:51.788 --> 02:34:53.369]  He was like, yeah, I'm in Afghanistan now.
[02:34:53.409 --> 02:34:54.810]  We're probably going to Iraq next.
[02:34:55.330 --> 02:34:56.171]  And that was in November 2001.
[02:34:56.611 --> 02:34:58.953]  And the troops knew they were going to Iraq.
[02:34:58.973 --> 02:34:59.613]  Well, they didn't know.
[02:34:59.633 --> 02:35:01.574]  I guess it was more like a joke among the troops.
[02:35:02.195 --> 02:35:06.138]  But basically, Corey just got out of the Army this past summer.
[02:35:06.258 --> 02:35:09.280]  Oh, yeah, I think I heard of Corey on Jack Blood's show.
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:10.741]  Yeah, you probably have.
[02:35:10.821 --> 02:35:14.123]  And he's got out of the Army, and he's been fighting the good fight ever since.
[02:35:15.624 --> 02:35:17.866]  And didn't he work with you on the new film?
[02:35:18.809 --> 02:35:20.451]  Yeah, he's my producer and advisor.
[02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:28.418]  I'm the one that does the editing and all the work, but he stands over my shoulder, gives me advice, tells me what looks good, what doesn't, and does the producer's job.
[02:35:29.258 --> 02:35:33.322]  Well, that's why the New World Order's got a problem, is their troops, their military, their police.
[02:35:33.422 --> 02:35:35.784]  We are turning them to the light every day.
[02:35:35.804 --> 02:35:37.646]  They are coming over to America.
[02:35:38.026 --> 02:35:38.887]  They are coming home.
[02:35:38.927 --> 02:35:44.632]  They are coming home to decency and honor and beauty and love and just everything wholesome.
[02:35:45.439 --> 02:35:47.520]  And they are feeling so good when they do it.
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:50.142]  They are being empowered to be the warriors they truly are.
[02:35:50.942 --> 02:35:52.403]  And the New World Order needs to know this.
[02:35:52.443 --> 02:35:53.464]  We're not going down easy.
[02:35:53.484 --> 02:35:54.824]  We're not going down without a fight.
[02:35:55.125 --> 02:35:56.165]  We know who you are.
[02:35:56.225 --> 02:35:57.166]  We know what you've done.
[02:35:57.186 --> 02:36:01.308]  And we know what you're trying to set up will make all your previous crimes pale in significance.
[02:36:01.388 --> 02:36:03.409]  And I just want them to know you've got to fight.
[02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:06.211]  You don't control all of us and our numbers are growing.
[02:36:06.451 --> 02:36:07.652]  You want to tell them that, Dylan?
[02:36:08.974 --> 02:36:09.234]  Yep.
[02:36:09.634 --> 02:36:10.515]  That's what I'm doing, man.
[02:36:10.555 --> 02:36:11.336]  I'm doing my part.
[02:36:12.197 --> 02:36:13.979]  Are you taking them on at point-blank range?
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:15.060]  Yeah.
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:16.942]  Are you engaging enemy formations?
[02:36:17.482 --> 02:36:22.908]  Hey, man, if you could get me within speaking distance of any of these people, seriously, I'll get some answers out of them.
[02:36:23.789 --> 02:36:25.911]  I mean, I would love to be in a room with George Bush.
[02:36:26.031 --> 02:36:26.732]  I would love it.
[02:36:28.906 --> 02:36:30.808]  Let's take a couple more calls.
[02:36:30.848 --> 02:36:33.870]  Again, if you want to get Loose Change, it's on InfoWars.com.
[02:36:33.890 --> 02:36:37.774]  Dylan graciously has authorized me to post it on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[02:36:37.794 --> 02:36:38.875]  That will be up by next week.
[02:36:39.655 --> 02:36:44.139]  And just such a wonderful film, and we're so honored to have Dylan with us.
[02:36:44.159 --> 02:36:45.560]  If you want to get a copy of it, it's 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.982]  And just a testament to Dylan and his crew,
[02:36:56.218 --> 02:36:56.838]  We're good to go.
[02:36:56.858 --> 02:36:57.359]  We're good to go.
[02:37:14.674 --> 02:37:15.875]  Be sure and get a hard copy of it.
[02:37:16.455 --> 02:37:17.836]  Well, all supplies last, Dylan.
[02:37:17.856 --> 02:37:20.077]  We're starting to run out of that first shipment.
[02:37:20.877 --> 02:37:21.938]  How soon do we get some more?
[02:37:21.978 --> 02:37:24.239]  I mean, we've got some in stock right now, but not many.
[02:37:25.119 --> 02:37:26.220]  How long do you get some more in?
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:28.801]  Hopefully within a week or two, man.
[02:37:29.041 --> 02:37:30.882]  We're doing a lot of things right now.
[02:37:30.942 --> 02:37:32.243]  Like I told you over the break, we...
[02:37:33.178 --> 02:37:35.780]  We kind of got shot down at the last minute by our last player.
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:38.801]  No, I understand, but you just got more in.
[02:37:38.861 --> 02:37:40.442]  It's good to be selling out of something.
[02:37:40.702 --> 02:37:44.204]  Let's go ahead here and go back to the calls.
[02:37:44.705 --> 02:37:46.126]  Mike in Oregon.
[02:37:46.146 --> 02:37:46.806]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:37:47.446 --> 02:37:47.807]  Hey, Alex.
[02:37:47.987 --> 02:37:49.828]  I just have a couple quick questions.
[02:37:50.008 --> 02:37:50.908]  First one to Dylan.
[02:37:50.948 --> 02:37:54.530]  I just wanted to know if he's found himself on the no-fly list.
[02:37:55.131 --> 02:37:57.052]  And, Alex, I know you're not, and I was wondering...
[02:37:57.981 --> 02:38:00.407]  I find it weird that you're not on the no-fly list.
[02:38:00.808 --> 02:38:01.489]  My dad is.
[02:38:01.970 --> 02:38:02.411]  Your dad is?
[02:38:02.832 --> 02:38:03.193]  Yes.
[02:38:04.215 --> 02:38:04.636]  Because...
[02:38:05.609 --> 02:38:10.312]  They do it selectively, and they know I'll scream bloody murder and make a big deal out of it.
[02:38:10.352 --> 02:38:11.512]  I mean, Ted Kennedy is.
[02:38:12.273 --> 02:38:21.438]  My dad, because his name is so common, Jones is very common, his first name is even more common, and so he started adding his middle initial.
[02:38:21.518 --> 02:38:28.542]  In his case, it really is a mistake, because there's so many people, I mean, there's got to be tens of thousands with his name just in the U.S.
[02:38:28.602 --> 02:38:31.984]  alone, and then in Western Europe and England, there's just as many.
[02:38:32.004 --> 02:38:33.605]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:38:35.486 --> 02:38:48.053]  And so they did advise people that if you're having trouble with a really common name, that what you do is you just add your initial, or maybe your initial's matching somebody, you take your initial out, and you get through.
[02:38:48.073 --> 02:38:55.937]  You know, it's like four-year-olds that can't fly because their name is the same as somebody else, and TSA goes, we know you're not him, but sorry, you can't fly.
[02:38:55.997 --> 02:38:59.800]  So there is some clear harassment, but at the same time, there's not harassment.
[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:02.041]  Like, there's been Green Party people who are going to fly to
[02:39:02.561 --> 02:39:03.022]  We're good to go.
[02:39:19.705 --> 02:39:23.729]  And I always intensify the attack every time I'm attacked.
[02:39:23.749 --> 02:39:26.732]  They understand that's my instinctive mode.
[02:39:26.912 --> 02:39:28.134]  I don't run, I fight.
[02:39:28.734 --> 02:39:34.220]  You can fight or flight, or you can grovel and go into a catatonic unnatural state.
[02:39:34.601 --> 02:39:40.147]  I don't run, unless I believe that's the right thing to do, but generally my instincts are don't.
[02:39:40.627 --> 02:39:46.173]  I'm not going to say that there's not a place for that.
[02:39:46.534 --> 02:39:49.597]  No one to hold them, no one to fold them, no one to walk away, no one to run.
[02:39:51.839 --> 02:39:53.100]  People ask, why am I alive?
[02:39:53.361 --> 02:39:55.263]  Because they don't want to make me a martyr, folks.
[02:39:56.175 --> 02:39:58.018]  Now, may there be a fake mugging.
[02:39:58.058 --> 02:40:02.144]  May I get killed in a drive-by and they grab some crackhead and blame it on them.
[02:40:02.324 --> 02:40:02.885]  Could that happen?
[02:40:02.925 --> 02:40:04.247]  Yeah, but we're all going to die.
[02:40:04.447 --> 02:40:08.934]  You know, and again, the number one cause of death is getting on the highway until you're 55.
[02:40:09.274 --> 02:40:11.097]  And it's heart attacks and cancer, respectively.
[02:40:11.797 --> 02:40:16.340]  But we all still get in our cars and are hurled down the road at 80 miles an hour with 18 wheelers right beside us.
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:27.846]  I was driving up to a car dealership to pick up my car that had some work done on it Saturday, and I saw a pickup truck all smashed with them cutting the guy out, tuned into the news later driving back, and he was dead!
[02:40:28.596 --> 02:40:29.877]  Now, Al Qaeda didn't kill him.
[02:40:29.897 --> 02:40:31.218]  George Bush didn't kill him.
[02:40:32.759 --> 02:40:34.240]  Chubacabra didn't kill him.
[02:40:35.541 --> 02:40:37.442]  Lions and tigers and bears didn't kill him.
[02:40:37.482 --> 02:40:40.004]  It was a car hurtling down I-35.
[02:40:40.044 --> 02:40:41.745]  And we all make that decision every day.
[02:40:41.945 --> 02:40:43.126]  We put our kids in the car.
[02:40:43.166 --> 02:40:44.087]  We drive out on the road.
[02:40:44.327 --> 02:40:46.228]  But then we're all quaking in fear of the government.
[02:40:46.589 --> 02:40:49.211]  Listen, man, life's too short to be afraid of dying.
[02:40:49.791 --> 02:40:50.692]  I am not afraid.
[02:40:51.312 --> 02:40:56.676]  And it's not even some heroic thing to just gut up and get past your fear.
[02:40:57.536 --> 02:40:57.976]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:58.216 --> 02:40:58.917]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:40:59.997 --> 02:41:01.698]  No, just wondering if Dylan's on the list.
[02:41:02.898 --> 02:41:03.478]  No, I'm not.
[02:41:03.578 --> 02:41:06.299]  As of last July, I flew out to California.
[02:41:06.319 --> 02:41:08.080]  I plan on going back in the next couple months.
[02:41:08.100 --> 02:41:11.141]  So if I get shot down at the ticket counter, I'll definitely let you know.
[02:41:12.802 --> 02:41:14.102]  And also, just a quick one, Alex.
[02:41:14.162 --> 02:41:16.123]  Do you give fellow filmmakers sort of like a...
[02:41:17.329 --> 02:41:22.814]  A blanket, I guess, approval to use your voice or image in documentaries to help get the word out?
[02:41:22.974 --> 02:41:28.999]  You know, I can't sit here on the radio and just say, oh, blanket, you can do whatever you want because my enemies will do stuff.
[02:41:29.879 --> 02:41:37.786]  But I've authorized people for non-profit educational purposes that is giving my videos away that you can do that because it's all fair use.
[02:41:38.386 --> 02:41:48.695]  But I do reserve the right to revoke people who are abusing it, so there isn't just a blanket carte blanche thing.
[02:41:48.775 --> 02:41:59.884]  But under fair use, you don't have to ask my permission if you want to use a very small portion of what I'm doing, or if you are critiquing what I'm doing, either good or bad.
[02:41:59.904 --> 02:42:01.585]  So you need to look into the law on that.
[02:42:01.625 --> 02:42:02.306]  Thank you for the call.
[02:42:03.207 --> 02:42:05.589]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Missouri.
[02:42:05.629 --> 02:42:06.409]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:42:06.449 --> 02:42:06.790]  Go ahead.
[02:42:07.891 --> 02:42:09.492]  Hey, Dylan, just calling to say hi.
[02:42:09.532 --> 02:42:10.232]  How you doing, man?
[02:42:11.493 --> 02:42:12.734]  I'm trying to do my best, buddy.
[02:42:12.754 --> 02:42:13.214]  How about you?
[02:42:13.454 --> 02:42:14.254]  Oh, just fine.
[02:42:14.595 --> 02:42:16.516]  I'm really sorry to hear about that distributor.
[02:42:16.536 --> 02:42:17.697]  That was not very nice.
[02:42:19.098 --> 02:42:21.599]  Yeah, it's all right, man.
[02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.480]  Let's move on to some information.
[02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:24.901]  Anything you want to talk about in the New World Order?
[02:42:25.121 --> 02:42:25.982]  Concentration camps?
[02:42:26.002 --> 02:42:29.664]  You know, we had a big professor on last hour saying he doesn't know if we'll make it.
[02:42:29.704 --> 02:42:31.225]  We may go into total martial law.
[02:42:31.745 --> 02:42:33.567]  Any comments on something like that or anything?
[02:42:34.347 --> 02:42:35.788]  Actually, yeah, I disagree completely.
[02:42:36.283 --> 02:42:38.304]  With the pessimism.
[02:42:38.824 --> 02:42:40.524]  In all honesty, it's going to fall.
[02:42:41.604 --> 02:42:42.445]  It is going to fall.
[02:42:43.025 --> 02:42:45.706]  This Patriot Act, it's going to burn.
[02:42:46.566 --> 02:42:55.608]  It's going to go away because people have waken up now and they're realizing what they've seen in front of them is, you know, Toto, I'm not in Kansas anymore.
[02:42:56.448 --> 02:42:57.329]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:59.989]  I think the illusion is disappearing.
[02:43:00.009 --> 02:43:03.130]  I mean, I think people are really seeing through things.
[02:43:04.291 --> 02:43:04.851]  Exactly.
[02:43:05.491 --> 02:43:05.611]  And
[02:43:06.505 --> 02:43:16.332]  I predict similar things are going to happen here that happened in Great Britain a long time ago when they had similar things with supposed terrorist attacks.
[02:43:16.852 --> 02:43:27.300]  People in the government, people will go into office and then suddenly realize this legislation defeats the purpose of our form of government.
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:29.341]  Let's get rid of this legislation.
[02:43:30.602 --> 02:43:32.764]  It's good to talk about repealing things.
[02:43:32.824 --> 02:43:33.804]  I appreciate the call.
[02:43:33.924 --> 02:43:35.486]  Matt in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:43:35.526 --> 02:43:35.966]  Go ahead.
[02:43:36.858 --> 02:43:38.660]  Yes, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:40.802]  I just want to thank you all for all that you do.
[02:43:40.822 --> 02:43:44.765]  I had a comment about the title, Loose Change.
[02:43:45.706 --> 02:43:46.147]  Yes.
[02:43:47.128 --> 02:43:48.509]  What I first thought it was about...
[02:43:49.255 --> 02:43:56.697]  I thought it might be about the gold that was missing out of the bottom of the World Trade Center in the economic... That's right, a hundred and something billion.
[02:43:56.797 --> 02:43:59.477]  Admittedly there, gold doesn't disappear, folks.
[02:44:00.298 --> 02:44:03.458]  And then there's just no discussion about it now.
[02:44:03.778 --> 02:44:07.959]  You ask the media, they go, we're not going to talk about those Federal Reserve vaults, Dylan.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:18.222]  Yeah, we actually covered that in the conclusion of the second edition, go over the gold that was missing in the empty dump trucks and the convoy of cars that was found underneath World Trade Center for...
[02:44:19.161 --> 02:44:23.066]  No bodies recovered, which means basically these people got out of their trucks and started running.
[02:44:23.593 --> 02:44:25.694]  I mean, how did they know the South Tower was going to collapse?
[02:44:25.914 --> 02:44:34.558]  Do you remember Die Hard 3, where the Germans carry out a terror attack, but really it's a diversion to rob the World Trade Center vaults?
[02:44:35.179 --> 02:44:37.680]  Globalists just love doing stuff like this.
[02:44:38.740 --> 02:44:39.301]  They love it.
[02:44:40.101 --> 02:44:50.886]  They have a Fox TV special, Lone Gunman, where a government group hijacks a jet to fly it by remote control and blame it on hijackers into the World Trade Center so they can attack Afghanistan.
[02:44:51.106 --> 02:44:52.507]  Then I have Dean Haglund on...
[02:44:53.047 --> 02:44:57.288]  From the start of the show, saying that the CIA was planning those stories on them.
[02:44:58.448 --> 02:44:59.969]  I mean, how much more obvious is that?
[02:45:01.169 --> 02:45:02.789]  It doesn't get much more obvious than that, Matt.
[02:45:04.290 --> 02:45:06.990]  No, it doesn't get much more obvious than that.
[02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:09.111]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying there, Matt.
[02:45:09.611 --> 02:45:20.093]  Well, I'd like to add that I was just talking to my rep at Midas yesterday, and he informed me that the M3 money supply figures are going to be discontinued
[02:45:20.979 --> 02:45:25.500]  In March, and that's what I think makes the gold so pertinent.
[02:45:25.801 --> 02:45:26.401]  That's right.
[02:45:27.121 --> 02:45:34.263]  If you thought that Alan Greenspan printed money and rubbed down the value of the dollar by roughly 45%, get ready for this new guy.
[02:45:34.363 --> 02:45:35.964]  He is called Mr. Helicopter.
[02:45:36.304 --> 02:45:39.025]  He said he wants to just literally dump money out of helicopters.
[02:45:39.045 --> 02:45:39.765]  Helicopter ban.
[02:45:40.545 --> 02:45:43.466]  Sounds good until you realize that it'll be worth toilet paper.
[02:45:44.122 --> 02:45:45.903]  Right, and that's how they're really getting us.
[02:45:45.943 --> 02:45:49.664]  That's my personal interest, is what they're doing to us economically, Alex.
[02:45:50.084 --> 02:45:53.745]  But I'll tell you what, you guys just keep up what you're doing, and I'm going to keep listening.
[02:45:53.785 --> 02:45:54.345]  Thanks a lot.
[02:45:55.105 --> 02:45:55.505]  I hear you.
[02:45:55.525 --> 02:45:56.265]  I appreciate it.
[02:45:56.666 --> 02:45:59.486]  Listen, folks, we have the strongest currency in the world.
[02:46:00.507 --> 02:46:05.428]  It is now barely first world status, about to drop into major third world status.
[02:46:05.448 --> 02:46:07.208]  I mean, you know, we all joke about Mexico.
[02:46:07.789 --> 02:46:10.469]  You can go down there with a hundred bucks and live for a week.
[02:46:11.009 --> 02:46:12.710]  They've got a junk currency.
[02:46:13.323 --> 02:46:14.344]  Bush gives you a little 5% tax cut.
[02:46:30.151 --> 02:46:34.134]  Yeah, I'm definitely going to turn my money into gold as soon as possible, without a doubt.
[02:46:52.907 --> 02:46:58.171]  Well, I mean, obviously, folks, this network's owned by a company that sells gold.
[02:46:58.771 --> 02:47:01.433]  But, I mean, that's where I bought my gold.
[02:47:01.453 --> 02:47:03.134]  I bought some of this from Midas Resources.
[02:47:03.174 --> 02:47:04.896]  I guess about five, six different buys.
[02:47:04.936 --> 02:47:06.036]  No more than that over the years.
[02:47:06.096 --> 02:47:07.337]  A few coins here, a few coins there.
[02:47:07.377 --> 02:47:11.100]  But, you know, regardless, I don't have to sit there and stand on trust me.
[02:47:11.961 --> 02:47:17.505]  Gold has doubled in value in the last five years, and the stock market has gone down.
[02:47:18.305 --> 02:47:19.846]  And then people go, well, it's at $11,000, Alex Jones.
[02:47:21.405 --> 02:47:22.006]  Mm-hmm.
[02:47:22.066 --> 02:47:23.266]  So, any more callers?
[02:47:46.613 --> 02:47:49.854]  We're going to go to some after this quick break, Dylan.
[02:47:49.874 --> 02:47:58.196]  We're going to go to break here, and then we're going to come back and start taking a few more final phone calls here in the final segment.
[02:47:58.236 --> 02:48:07.119]  But just so I can understand this, you are now going to try to make what a feature film out of what really happened on 9-11?
[02:48:08.059 --> 02:48:09.079]  Yeah, we're going to do our best.
[02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:14.481]  I mean, we have limited resources, but hopefully if everything goes right this year, we'll have...
[02:48:15.296 --> 02:48:17.317]  Enough within our hands to film the movie.
[02:48:17.797 --> 02:48:19.998]  Well, it'd be great to have Mel Gibson make that movie.
[02:48:21.878 --> 02:48:23.979]  Actually, you should get me in touch with Robert Rodriguez.
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:29.301]  Yeah, I don't know if Robert Rodriguez would want to do something like that.
[02:48:30.321 --> 02:48:31.082]  Who knows?
[02:48:31.682 --> 02:48:32.082]  Who knows?
[02:48:32.122 --> 02:48:32.542]  He might.
[02:48:33.983 --> 02:48:35.403]  I know Richard Linklater pretty good.
[02:48:35.423 --> 02:48:36.704]  I don't really know Robert very well.
[02:48:37.244 --> 02:48:39.605]  But we'll be right back with Dylan Avery.
[02:48:39.625 --> 02:48:40.005]  Stay with us.
[02:48:42.025 --> 02:48:47.150]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.311 --> 02:48:50.414]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.534 --> 02:48:54.438]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.478 --> 02:48:58.722]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[02:48:59.063 --> 02:49:02.847]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.987 --> 02:49:04.789]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:08.031 --> 02:49:13.034]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.174 --> 02:49:16.215]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.395 --> 02:49:19.277]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.757 --> 02:49:25.881]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.401 --> 02:49:26.921]  We're good to go.
[02:49:45.223 --> 02:49:50.447]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.587 --> 02:49:58.673]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:58.933 --> 02:50:05.998]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.158 --> 02:50:13.042]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:13.062 --> 02:50:15.403]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:33.354 --> 02:50:37.375]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:48.772 --> 02:51:49.312]  Don't worry.
[02:51:49.753 --> 02:51:51.294]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.794 --> 02:51:59.578]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.658 --> 02:52:02.240]  Very, very busy out there fighting the New World Order.
[02:52:03.248 --> 02:52:03.928]  And that's good.
[02:52:03.948 --> 02:52:05.369]  Talk to Ruben and Dave.
[02:52:05.409 --> 02:52:06.470]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:52:06.490 --> 02:52:07.670]  This has been a great broadcast today.
[02:52:07.690 --> 02:52:09.471]  I want to thank all of our guests that came on.
[02:52:09.491 --> 02:52:18.136]  If you missed the interview in the last hour with the professor from Notre Dame, Notre Dame University, who debated this John Yoo about how the government says they can torture children in front of their parents.
[02:52:18.156 --> 02:52:19.516]  I mean, this is getting sick.
[02:52:19.556 --> 02:52:21.237]  If you missed that, it's coming back up tonight.
[02:52:21.257 --> 02:52:22.398]  You want to tune in for that.
[02:52:23.398 --> 02:52:24.619]  Ruben in Ohio.
[02:52:24.659 --> 02:52:25.199]  You're on the air.
[02:52:25.259 --> 02:52:25.839]  Go ahead, Ruben.
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:27.520]  Hey, thanks.
[02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:32.823]  My favorite part of Loose Change is where you show the jet turbine blowing a
[02:52:33.336 --> 02:52:46.006]  I think it's an ambulance or a car away from it as it approaches on a runway, proving that a 747 couldn't have flown over that highway without tumbling cars over hitting the Pentagon.
[02:52:47.287 --> 02:52:58.296]  Yeah, the reason I removed that clip from the second edition of Loose Change is because there was some speculation that that video was actually a computer simulation or something that was staged and not actually real.
[02:52:58.616 --> 02:52:59.117]  Was it real?
[02:52:59.137 --> 02:52:59.237]  Yeah.
[02:53:00.525 --> 02:53:00.885]  I don't know.
[02:53:00.925 --> 02:53:02.166]  I heard a couple different claims.
[02:53:02.186 --> 02:53:03.067]  Some people said it was real.
[02:53:03.087 --> 02:53:05.809]  Some people said... I couldn't really get much of a verifiable source.
[02:53:06.350 --> 02:53:11.574]  Regardless, the Pentagon stinks from every different angle, and I think it's important to look at it in the film.
[02:53:12.015 --> 02:53:12.936]  The film does that.
[02:53:12.996 --> 02:53:13.736]  Anything else, Ruben?
[02:53:14.297 --> 02:53:21.103]  There's a guy on TV pushing this book, Kevin Trudeau, National Cures They Don't Want You to Know About, and I was watching last night, and I'm thinking...
[02:53:21.584 --> 02:53:27.589]  Why doesn't Alex Jones or Dylan Avery push their 9-11 videos on an infomercial?
[02:53:27.649 --> 02:53:28.289]  Is that possible?
[02:53:28.330 --> 02:53:31.072]  You know, I don't think that at this point it's a great idea.
[02:53:31.152 --> 02:53:32.013]  People should do it.
[02:53:32.073 --> 02:53:33.714]  If somebody else does it, more power to them.
[02:53:33.754 --> 02:53:34.855]  My goal is to get the word out.
[02:53:35.776 --> 02:53:37.017]  They can refuse.
[02:53:37.037 --> 02:53:39.158]  I know a few have actually tried similar things.
[02:53:39.178 --> 02:53:41.060]  They can refuse to let you buy time on them.
[02:53:42.424 --> 02:53:44.686]  Trudeau's even had trouble and his stuff's pretty mild.
[02:53:45.306 --> 02:53:51.832]  And it takes a lot of capital to even produce those at the standards they demand and then to distribute it and do it.
[02:53:51.892 --> 02:53:53.494]  It is a monumental undertaking.
[02:53:53.534 --> 02:53:54.494]  It should be attempted.
[02:53:54.514 --> 02:53:55.435]  It should be tried.
[02:53:56.376 --> 02:53:59.399]  But again, we need to be capitalized and supported to do that.
[02:54:00.206 --> 02:54:02.990]  According to some, I'm bad that I say make copies of my videos.
[02:54:03.090 --> 02:54:04.091]  I shouldn't even sell them.
[02:54:04.392 --> 02:54:07.095]  The problem is we couldn't even make films if we didn't sell films.
[02:54:07.135 --> 02:54:11.020]  But that's the COINTELPRO people that don't want us to even be able to fight the New World Order.
[02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:12.041]  Thank you, Ruben, for the call.
[02:54:12.502 --> 02:54:13.423]  Dave in Connecticut.
[02:54:13.443 --> 02:54:14.945]  That's a great idea from Ruben, isn't it?
[02:54:15.967 --> 02:54:16.948]  That's a great idea, Dylan.
[02:54:17.603 --> 02:54:18.224]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:54:18.264 --> 02:54:20.246]  Let's talk to Dave in Connecticut.
[02:54:20.266 --> 02:54:21.047]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:54:21.107 --> 02:54:21.527]  Go ahead.
[02:54:21.767 --> 02:54:22.228]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:22.308 --> 02:54:22.769]  How are you?
[02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:23.149]  Good.
[02:54:23.169 --> 02:54:25.772]  Listen, I'm worried about the economics of the situation.
[02:54:25.792 --> 02:54:30.397]  I agree that the Patriot Act might get turned down, but I'll give you an example.
[02:54:30.477 --> 02:54:32.519]  Regional news up here in the Connecticut area.
[02:54:32.979 --> 02:54:37.764]  An iconic company, something you're going to be very familiar with, Winchester Repeating Arms.
[02:54:37.784 --> 02:54:39.726]  They're going to be closing the plant in 60 days.
[02:54:41.048 --> 02:54:41.709]  60 days, Alex.
[02:54:41.789 --> 02:54:42.990]  Winchester repeating arms.
[02:54:43.310 --> 02:54:44.511]  The gun that won the West.
[02:54:44.551 --> 02:54:46.733]  And you want to know what they're thinking of reopening the plant?
[02:54:47.433 --> 02:54:49.475]  I thought Winchester was already in Japan.
[02:54:50.016 --> 02:55:00.184]  Well, there's a New Haven plant here, and they're making stuff, and they're going to be closing it, and it's going to be going, the rest of the operation, if they've got some of it there, is going to be going to China.
[02:55:00.712 --> 02:55:04.975]  Yeah, I knew Japan actually had manufacturing plants in China.
[02:55:05.035 --> 02:55:06.776]  I thought it was a Japanese operation, though.
[02:55:06.796 --> 02:55:12.860]  Well, according to what I'm hearing from the mayor of New Haven on the local news, which, of course, you take what you take, he's trying to stop it.
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.382]  But I'll give you another quick example.
[02:55:15.482 --> 02:55:19.765]  I worked for the world's largest oil company, won't mention their name, for five years.
[02:55:19.865 --> 02:55:20.525]  ExxonMobil.
[02:55:20.725 --> 02:55:20.946]  Right.
[02:55:21.006 --> 02:55:22.687]  They closed the plant in Connecticut.
[02:55:22.767 --> 02:55:28.611]  It was a plastics manufacturing facility because the price of resin went up when they helped raise, by the way.
[02:55:28.931 --> 02:55:30.272]  Said it wasn't making any money.
[02:55:31.045 --> 02:55:39.849]  And then I went to... 60 days later, I got another job at a rolling mill company in the Connecticut area that had been open since 1905.
[02:55:40.810 --> 02:55:43.691]  I was there for 45 days and they announced...
[02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:45.271]  They're closing the plant.
[02:55:45.351 --> 02:55:46.492]  Hey, that's a great economy.
[02:55:46.512 --> 02:55:47.353]  The economy's great.
[02:55:47.393 --> 02:55:48.994]  It's a liberal lie that it isn't.
[02:55:49.535 --> 02:55:50.496]  Thank you for the call, Dave.
[02:55:50.516 --> 02:55:51.036]  Great points.
[02:55:51.156 --> 02:55:53.678]  Dylan Avery, again, I'm just so glad you stood up to the plate.
[02:55:54.359 --> 02:55:55.019]  Made a great film.
[02:55:55.059 --> 02:55:57.522]  Your second edition is even better.
[02:55:57.562 --> 02:55:59.143]  We'll carry it at Infowars.com.
[02:55:59.463 --> 02:56:01.305]  Thank you so much for defending this country.
[02:56:02.105 --> 02:56:03.427]  Yeah, thanks for having me on your show, Alex.
[02:56:03.447 --> 02:56:05.729]  I've been looking forward to it.
[02:56:05.789 --> 02:56:06.349]  You bet.
[02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:10.012]  And we look forward to having you back on again in the future.
[02:56:10.052 --> 02:56:10.713]  So God bless you.
[02:56:11.323 --> 02:56:12.264]  Yeah, you too, Alex.
[02:56:12.344 --> 02:56:12.984]  Take care of yourself.
[02:56:13.144 --> 02:56:13.424]  You bet.
[02:56:13.444 --> 02:56:13.744]  Bye-bye.
[02:56:14.245 --> 02:56:14.865]  All right, folks.
[02:56:14.885 --> 02:56:16.286]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:16.326 --> 02:56:18.707]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:19.147 --> 02:56:21.189]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:21.369 --> 02:56:23.970]  God bless you all.
