[00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.307]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:08.028]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:09.869]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:11.270]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:12.963]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:17.304]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:21.965]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:24.686]  Welcome to the French...
[00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:44.049]  It's the 17th day of January 2006.
[00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.312]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:49.213]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:50.855]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:58.522]  We're also scheduled to have the NSA whistleblower joining us, Sybil Edmonds, today as well.
[00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:01.664]  And we're working on one other surprise guest.
[00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:04.607]  But we will have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:07.650]  Any news issue, any item, you disagree with me, you agree with me.
[00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.853]  You think we've missed something that we should be talking about?
[00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:12.535]  Whatever you'd like to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.941]  This is all about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:22.543]  We're defending this country from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:26.026]  Both political parties are bought and paid for by the New World Order.
[00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:31.952]  They use smoke and mirrors to distract and divert us, and we are here exposing and fighting that.
[00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:33.813]  The feds are beating the drum again.
[00:01:33.974 --> 00:01:38.277]  Only a matter of time before terrorists use weapons of mass destruction.
[00:01:38.317 --> 00:01:40.960]  We better give up all of our rights to them and let them on our lives.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.001]  Or the evil terrorists will have their way with us.
[00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:49.723]  I wonder why the terrorists are always trying to help out the government and the private financial interests that own and control it.
[00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:52.765]  There's more rebellions in China.
[00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:56.006]  Chinese violently quell new protest.
[00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.151]  We're good to go.
[00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.350]  More U.S.
[00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.114]  fighters moving into the area, into Iraq, Turkey, and other areas, openly saying they may attack, may invade Israel, saying the same thing.
[00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:24.877]  Christina Amanpour, who if anybody is a CIA front in the media, it's her.
[00:02:24.897 --> 00:02:28.519]  I mean, we've already caught a lot of them being under the globalist control.
[00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.260]  She poses as a leftist.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.701]  It's completely obvious the thing she's up to.
[00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:36.529]  Openly misquoting with their Arabic translator.
[00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.110]  They knew what he said in the address.
[00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:44.634]  They knew that he said that they were dedicated to developing peaceful nuclear power.
[00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:48.777]  And then that got turned into, The leader of Iran says he'll nuke Israel!
[00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:49.637]  It's documented!
[00:02:49.657 --> 00:02:49.937]  See?
[00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:50.438]  Kill him!
[00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:50.878]  Kill him!
[00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:53.519]  It doesn't matter if it's shown to be false letters.
[00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.840]  Still, that's in people's minds.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.102]  It's like all the hundreds of reports of, We found WMDs!
[00:02:58.142 --> 00:02:58.562]  We found them!
[00:02:58.582 --> 00:02:59.023]  We found them!
[00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:01.424]  There's lots of people that say they found them.
[00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:07.703]  In fact, you know, there are lots of neocon publications selling books and little magazines.
[00:03:07.883 --> 00:03:10.867]  You know, the headline, We Found WMDs!
[00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:13.089]  Why Won't Bush Defend Himself?
[00:03:15.092 --> 00:03:16.093]  It's just amazing.
[00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:20.318]  And I'll be arguing with somebody in six months after they've invaded Iran, after they've attacked it.
[00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:25.057]  After World War III, he started, oh, no, he said he'd nuke Israel.
[00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:26.218]  No, no, that's not true.
[00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.839]  Oh, yeah, he did.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.081]  CNN, even them liberals.
[00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:32.203]  Yeah, liberals with Pentagon satellites.
[00:03:32.863 --> 00:03:34.224]  Liberals with all their fake news.
[00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:35.465]  I'm just tired of it.
[00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:38.668]  So we'll get into that.
[00:03:39.577 --> 00:03:43.481]  And also Russia says imposing sanctions is a bad way of dealing with Iran.
[00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:46.083]  Iran says they'll drive up oil prices if that happens.
[00:03:46.624 --> 00:03:48.806]  And they're threatening to block UN inspections.
[00:03:49.307 --> 00:03:50.087]  How dare them?
[00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:53.210]  They need to accept an international body running their country.
[00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:54.972]  National sovereignty is bad.
[00:03:55.032 --> 00:03:58.916]  Them Iranians need to be turned into a glass parking lot.
[00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:09.098]  And of course, a coalition urges the Department of Homeland Security to reject real ID chip mandate as the states adopt RFID and biometrics in all 50 states.
[00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:12.019]  The national ID card now taking shape.
[00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.939]  Meanwhile, the average American has no idea what's going on.
[00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.181]  Meanwhile, in England, lords defeat ID card scheme again.
[00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:22.602]  The people are against it in 80 plus percent.
[00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.582]  And so they're having trouble there.
[00:04:24.742 --> 00:04:26.103]  But the average American isn't.
[00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:27.183]  So a country where there's
[00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:36.094]  Four million plus surveillance cameras in London alone, and the citizens watch surveillance cameras on their cable as entertainment, where they have a total police state.
[00:04:36.454 --> 00:04:38.135]  You still don't have national ID cards.
[00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:40.837]  But, oh, here, land of the free, home of the brave, we do.
[00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:41.818]  And don't even know we do.
[00:04:41.858 --> 00:04:43.118]  It's part of the new freedom.
[00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.381]  Websites are still selling your cell phone records.
[00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:49.423]  And, folks, there's so much.
[00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:50.984]  So much.
[00:04:51.804 --> 00:05:00.652]  Coming up today, I haven't even scratched the surface, 1-800-259-9231 is the phone number, and the website's prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:02.493 --> 00:05:05.356]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.616 --> 00:05:07.177]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.538 --> 00:05:12.222]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.542 --> 00:05:19.268]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.588 --> 00:05:21.569]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.629]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.371]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:33.992]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate medium.
[00:05:34.232 --> 00:05:41.454]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.694 --> 00:05:44.114]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.275 --> 00:05:46.015]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:49.500]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.148]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:11.465]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:22.950]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.993]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:29.914]  We're good to go.
[00:06:53.353 --> 00:06:59.555]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:02.936]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:05.897]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[00:07:06.077 --> 00:07:11.459]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:13.220]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.501]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:19.182]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:07:19.602 --> 00:07:20.223]  We're good to go.
[00:07:42.358 --> 00:07:43.979]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:45.859]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.485 --> 00:08:18.735]  Sybil Edmonds, NSA whistleblower, scheduled to join us in the middle of the next hour.
[00:08:21.219 --> 00:08:27.727]  She was hired by the government post-9-11, and then she was told to go in and edit.
[00:08:28.937 --> 00:08:34.600]  NSA intercepts to actually go in and cover up what the NSA had intercepted.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:46.265]  You see, in reality, the NSA did get red flags about 9-11, and then they were ordered by the Bush administration to back off and shut up, and defense intelligence officers were told to back off.
[00:08:47.322 --> 00:08:49.043]  FBI agents were told to back off.
[00:08:49.503 --> 00:09:14.254]  You see, when Big Brother actually does do its job and pick up overseas transmissions and picks up chatter of what a compartmentalized group in the government is about to do to itself to use that as the catalyst to seize control and set up a police state in America and use this country as an engine for a world government empire, the NSA was told to back off and shut up.
[00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:17.405]  We're good to go.
[00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:17.725]  I think?
[00:09:42.003 --> 00:09:46.107]  Who then got a rude awakening about who they were really working for.
[00:09:46.147 --> 00:09:56.377]  And we have that open and shut case, ironclad, so much evidence, it quite frankly rivals the Atlantic Ocean, or perhaps the Pacific Ocean.
[00:09:56.897 --> 00:10:07.107]  I mean, it is big, it is wide, it is deep, it is voluminous, it is encyclopedic, it is ridiculously well-documented.
[00:10:09.756 --> 00:10:14.799]  People always say, Alex, a conspiracy, a program of corruption this big, it's too big.
[00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:15.659]  People would speak out.
[00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:16.659]  People would go public.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.821]  The people doing it would be caught, and they have been caught.
[00:10:21.002 --> 00:10:22.962]  How many congressmen and women have spoken out?
[00:10:22.982 --> 00:10:38.270]  How many high-level members of the current Bush administration and the Reagan administration and the former Bush administration and the Clinton administration and how many defense ministers and foreign ministers and how many agents and how many people at the Defense Language School and Pensacola Naval Air Station?
[00:10:39.762 --> 00:10:42.263]  Have gone public and said what I'm saying right now.
[00:10:42.664 --> 00:10:48.527]  But we're lucky it's in the back of some newspaper or the back of some journal or said in a radio interview.
[00:10:48.587 --> 00:11:09.277]  It's like John Loftus, a top counterterrorism expert for the FBI, had him on a few months ago, and he said, yeah, it's clear that ASWAT, the 7-7 bombing mastermind, the controller of some patsies, is MI6 and being protected, and he went through how clearly that it points directly to the British government.
[00:11:10.135 --> 00:11:11.737]  I mean, who is John Loftus?
[00:11:11.757 --> 00:11:15.962]  The guy's got a show on ABC News Radio every week.
[00:11:16.002 --> 00:11:20.166]  I mean, it's not like... This is not that radical of a broadcast.
[00:11:20.587 --> 00:11:28.816]  We just take all the different bad things that are happening, the scary things that are happening, the good things that are happening, the amazing things that are happening...
[00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:39.698]  We kind of wiggle around over the Michael Jackson story through the Britney Spears articles, around the stories about the UT Longhorns and the Rose Bowl.
[00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:43.421]  All of that stuff might be important to some people, but to us it's not.
[00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.085]  We go, oh look, there's five articles this week about how the feds,
[00:11:48.795 --> 00:12:14.990]  The Department of Agriculture and local governments are using the satellites to tax and fine and fee farmers and see how much you're really growing and see if you've got a well on your land you're not supposed to have or to see if you've built a house and need to be paying property taxes or a new barn where you're not allowed to build new barns because of the impervious cover zoning laws and then they send out Homeland Security and arrest you because it's a federal crime or it's a local crime.
[00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:24.712]  Oh, look, there's three articles today about defense intelligence and about the NSA having local police spying on citizens.
[00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:29.796]  Gun groups, liberal groups, land rights groups, the whole spectrum.
[00:12:29.876 --> 00:12:31.097]  Oh, but the border's wide open.
[00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:39.324]  Here's ten articles about more cops being killed and more federal troop invasions, Mexican federal troop invasions, and all of this.
[00:12:39.344 --> 00:12:40.846]  And, oh, here's articles about how...
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.503]  The national ID cards are now going in at the state level.
[00:12:44.523 --> 00:12:45.464]  They're state mandates.
[00:12:46.024 --> 00:12:47.245]  Federal mandates to the states.
[00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:48.727]  And it'll totally track us.
[00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.931]  Your ID card can be read from hundreds of feet away from readers they're putting up everywhere.
[00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:54.112]  No one asked you.
[00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:56.234]  They were putting the readers up before 9-11.
[00:12:56.274 --> 00:12:59.057]  The whole grid was being planned, being built, being set up.
[00:12:59.097 --> 00:13:01.379]  And then, oh, it's all because of 9-11 now.
[00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:03.822]  Pretty ridiculous.
[00:13:06.724 --> 00:13:12.845]  It'd be kind of like if the fire department showed up at your house before there was a fire, but as soon as they pull up, it explodes in flames.
[00:13:12.865 --> 00:13:17.326]  You'd think, man, the fire department got this knowledge from somebody who set the fire.
[00:13:19.127 --> 00:13:20.507]  But again, that's just logic.
[00:13:21.507 --> 00:13:23.188]  So all of this is going on.
[00:13:23.568 --> 00:13:24.288]  And then think about it.
[00:13:24.568 --> 00:13:27.769]  We have this crew who came into Congress.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:44.004]  Who came into the executive branch, who's gotten all these judgeships, the majority of the governorships, the gubernatorial seats, promising to end corruption, the age of credibility and upstandingness in government.
[00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:53.727]  And now we've seen a new dark age of corruption and bid rigging and profiteering and hundreds of millions stolen, you know, with this congressman or that congressman.
[00:13:53.987 --> 00:13:56.128]  Eight hundred million here, a hundred million there, and
[00:13:58.977 --> 00:14:06.322]  Abramoff, and trillions missing from the Pentagon, and Rumsfeld gets asked about it, and he just says, I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:14:06.422 --> 00:14:07.563]  I don't know where it is, so what?
[00:14:08.263 --> 00:14:12.967]  Just trillions of dollars, but don't worry, we're going to give you a ticket if we catch you speeding.
[00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.009]  This is the type of stuff that's happening.
[00:14:17.049 --> 00:14:21.012]  These are the type of things that are going on all over the country.
[00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:27.651]  And every classical indicator of tyranny is being set up in front of us.
[00:14:27.691 --> 00:14:46.020]  In fact, there's an amazing article that we have up on prisonplanet.com written by the former chief economist for Ronald Reagan, the deputy secretary of the treasury who ran the treasury department and was the main economist that Reagan tried to follow.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.162]  I mean, a real classical conservative.
[00:14:50.182 --> 00:14:51.143]  I'm inventing new words here.
[00:14:52.512 --> 00:14:53.073]  We're good to go.
[00:15:12.206 --> 00:15:35.324]  And I would say somewhat lukewarm, starting to get a little bit simmering and hot when it comes to surveillance, and then white hot, blistering hot, steel melting hot when it comes to preparations for overt, 10 on the Richter scale, classical, full-blown tyranny.
[00:15:38.018 --> 00:15:54.004]  So, I mean, depending on which indicator you look at, and Paul Craig Roberts has written a great article about this, and I intend to read much of the article here in the broadcast today.
[00:15:54.844 --> 00:15:56.585]  And, of course, we will be taking your phone calls.
[00:15:56.625 --> 00:15:59.986]  But just ignore what I'm saying.
[00:16:00.106 --> 00:16:01.246]  Everything's fine.
[00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:03.367]  The terrorists are going to strike us any minute.
[00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:09.083]  Henry Crumpton, the newly appointed head of counterterrorism at the U.S.
[00:16:09.523 --> 00:16:19.946]  State Department, believes that it's simply a matter of time before international terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda acquire weapons of mass destruction and use them in attacks.
[00:16:20.607 --> 00:16:29.490]  In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr. Crumpton, who previously spent 20 years working for the Central Intelligence Agency, which admits it's carried out terror attacks worldwide to blame it on their enemies, but...
[00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:31.307]  That's just a side issue.
[00:16:31.327 --> 00:16:37.352]  We're supposed to ignore the admissions that our own government carries out terror attacks to blame it on their political rivals or enemies.
[00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:42.876]  Warned yesterday that the war on terror was likely to last for decades.
[00:16:42.896 --> 00:16:45.538]  Well, Cheney says 100 years, Bush says 50.
[00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:52.744]  Basically until everything's under their control, under their progeny's control, until every bank account feeds directly into their fat gullets.
[00:16:53.436 --> 00:16:57.039]  The threat has changed the way we will fight wars in the future, he said.
[00:16:57.139 --> 00:17:05.127]  Ah yes, the perfect enemy, foggy, can never be defeated, you can accuse anyone of it, and then all crime can then be defined as terrorism.
[00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:08.740]  It brings federal control into everything.
[00:17:09.481 --> 00:17:16.347]  We are talking about micro-targets such as Al-Qaeda, which, when combined with WMD, have a micro-impact.
[00:17:16.587 --> 00:17:22.091]  I rate the probability of terror groups using WMD to attack Western targets as very high.
[00:17:22.152 --> 00:17:23.753]  It is simply a question of time.
[00:17:24.213 --> 00:17:26.035]  And it's not just a nuclear threat that bothers me.
[00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:29.578]  I think, if anything, the biological threat is going to grow.
[00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:41.493]  Well, much of the economy is shifting into the BioShield program to make hundreds of vaccines mandatory, to force these special concoctions, because the government loves us so much they want us to have these.
[00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:45.599]  It doesn't matter if the very same government, 3,000 plus times admittedly,
[00:17:46.099 --> 00:17:48.961]  Have tested chemical, biological, and radiologicals on U.S.
[00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.882]  populations, killing U.S.
[00:17:50.902 --> 00:17:53.444]  civilians and military by design on purpose.
[00:17:53.664 --> 00:17:54.424]  Declassified!
[00:17:54.844 --> 00:18:05.511]  We should just trust the very group that's done this over and over again to force these vaccines on us, despite the fact that Nobel Prize winners and many others have gone public in Indian and Chinese and Russian.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:17.609]  And African scientists have isolated cancer viruses, sterilization agents, good old classic poisons, in every batch of major vaccine that the UN has provided for the third world.
[00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:31.760]  We should just trust a group that openly says they want a world government so they can orderly reduce our population by 85 to 95 percent, depending on which study or document they put out, and who openly has been caught testing biologicals on us over and over again.
[00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:33.190]  You see, that's the thing.
[00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.174]  I had some caller who disagreed yesterday, and he didn't deny that the U.S.
[00:18:38.194 --> 00:18:43.779]  government, that is criminal elements of it, admittedly staged the Gulf of Tonkin, staged the U.S.'
[00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:50.045]  's liberty with Israel, carried out terror attacks in Iran to blame it on their political enemies.
[00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:51.946]  All that's admitted.
[00:18:51.966 --> 00:18:54.588]  I mean, I have CIA agents on all the time, government agents on all the time.
[00:18:54.609 --> 00:18:58.472]  They go, oh yeah, we carried out terror attacks in Iran to blame it on Mosaddegh.
[00:18:59.355 --> 00:19:00.895]  He just said, well, I just didn't.
[00:19:01.055 --> 00:19:02.016]  I'm not talking about that.
[00:19:02.056 --> 00:19:03.736]  He said, I don't think 9-11 was.
[00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:07.077]  And he goes, I don't think that pertains to this.
[00:19:07.137 --> 00:19:09.217]  See, it doesn't pertain to it.
[00:19:09.497 --> 00:19:14.998]  It'd be like if you had somebody on your street who'd committed ten murders.
[00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:23.600]  And then somebody got murdered on your street by the exact same tactics and methods
[00:19:24.526 --> 00:19:25.188]  We're good to go.
[00:19:25.208 --> 00:19:25.688]  We're good to go.
[00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:26.069]  We're good to go.
[00:19:38.502 --> 00:19:45.047]  I mean, let's imagine the guy's in prison, and he says when he gets out, he dreams of killing people a certain way.
[00:19:45.087 --> 00:19:47.829]  And then when he gets out, he commits a murder that exact way.
[00:19:48.369 --> 00:19:49.810]  Now, let's not question him.
[00:19:50.511 --> 00:19:51.391]  No, no, no.
[00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:56.515]  Let's go to the Antarctica and look for maybe a polar bear that did it.
[00:19:56.535 --> 00:19:59.097]  It's just, what's wrong with you?
[00:20:02.978 --> 00:20:05.502]  Thanks for tuning in to this edition of Coffee on the Air.

[00:20:15.837 --> 00:20:16.899]  More after this break.

[00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:18.767]  I think?

[00:22:56.963 --> 00:22:58.183]  That's toll-free, trip
[00:22:59.524 --> 00:23:02.527]  You don't love me anymore?
[00:23:02.867 --> 00:23:04.668]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:23:04.688 --> 00:23:06.169]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.590]  Yes.
[00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:07.731]  You neglect me.
[00:23:07.911 --> 00:23:09.892]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:23:11.714 --> 00:23:12.735]  Use the cheapest gas.
[00:23:13.055 --> 00:23:13.936]  I'm getting sick.
[00:23:14.276 --> 00:23:16.438]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:23:17.498 --> 00:23:17.958]  Wait a minute.
[00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:19.679]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:28.482]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:23:28.942 --> 00:23:34.404]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:23:34.624 --> 00:23:37.025]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:23:37.185 --> 00:23:41.827]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting?
[00:23:42.048 --> 00:23:43.708]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:23:43.908 --> 00:23:47.230]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.232]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:51.252 --> 00:23:53.173]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:24:10.662 --> 00:24:15.004]  This is an editorial piece written by Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:24:16.624 --> 00:24:25.508]  He was number two at the Department of Treasury during the Reagan administration and is highly respected as an extreme conservative all across the country.
[00:24:28.487 --> 00:24:38.492]  And by extreme conservative, he believes that the government spending more money than has ever been borrowed or spent by all administrations before it is not conservative.
[00:24:38.972 --> 00:24:44.395]  Or assigning predominantly anti-gun judges to judgeships is not conservative.
[00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:49.618]  Or more than tripling abortion money to the UN is not conservative.
[00:24:51.178 --> 00:24:55.661]  But again, I guess according to a lot of conservatives, killing babies is conservative.
[00:24:56.081 --> 00:24:58.162]  So I'm not going to argue with them
[00:24:58.743 --> 00:24:59.524]  Maybe they're right.
[00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:02.667]  Maybe we're evil liberals like they've always said.
[00:25:04.409 --> 00:25:05.890]  Paul Craig Roberts wrote this article.
[00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.813]  It's titled, Bush has crossed the Rubicon.
[00:25:08.853 --> 00:25:12.337]  Of course, that's when Caesar came across a particular river in the north of Italy.
[00:25:13.237 --> 00:25:24.093]  And if a general ever brought his main force into Italy proper, he was attempting, of course, to set up martial law, and he would be seized and basically executed if he didn't win.
[00:25:24.133 --> 00:25:29.681]  But he did bring his troops, of course, into Rome and did set up a dictator ship.
[00:25:32.265 --> 00:25:35.688]  There's a reason we have Posse Comitatus, the 1878 law.
[00:25:36.228 --> 00:25:40.472]  Dictatorships seldom appear full-fledged, but emerge piecemeal.
[00:25:41.032 --> 00:25:54.763]  When Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon with one Roman legion, he broke the tradition that protected the civilian government from victorious generals and launched the transformation of the Roman Republic into a Roman Empire.
[00:25:55.797 --> 00:26:00.539]  Now, remember how Tommy Franks and all these generals went, Gee, I'm real sorry.
[00:26:00.979 --> 00:26:05.321]  We're going to probably have a military dictatorship to keep you safe.
[00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:07.402]  Well, see, that's what Caesar said.
[00:26:07.502 --> 00:26:11.404]  I'm real sorry, but I've got to do this for Rome.
[00:26:12.164 --> 00:26:15.726]  Fearing that Caesar would become a king, the Senate assassinated him.
[00:26:16.586 --> 00:26:22.209]  And it says, From the civil wars that followed, Caesar's grand-nephew, Octavian...
[00:26:23.317 --> 00:26:27.799]  Emerged as the first Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus.
[00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:36.263]  Two thousand years later in Germany, Adolf Hitler's rise to dictator from his appointment as chancellor was rampant.
[00:26:37.183 --> 00:26:42.266]  Hitler used the Reichstag fire to create an atmosphere of crisis.
[00:26:43.266 --> 00:26:46.708]  Both the judicial and legislative branches of the government collapsed.
[00:26:46.748 --> 00:26:47.588]  That's now happening.
[00:26:48.819 --> 00:26:50.201]  Because he says he doesn't have to follow them.
[00:26:50.481 --> 00:26:52.723]  And Hitler's decrees became law.
[00:26:52.803 --> 00:26:56.527]  That's what they're now claiming, that executive wartime power.
[00:26:57.268 --> 00:27:09.180]  The Decree for the Protection of the People and the State, February 28, 1933, suspended guarantees of personal liberty and permitted arrest and incarceration
[00:27:11.585 --> 00:27:12.447]  Without trial.
[00:27:12.887 --> 00:27:27.269]  The Enabling Act, March 23, 1933, transferred legislative power to Herr Hitler, permitting him to decree laws, laws, moreover, that may deviate from the German Constitution.
[00:27:28.408 --> 00:27:32.572]  The dictatorship of the Roman emperors was not based on an ideology.
[00:27:32.632 --> 00:27:39.238]  The Nazis had an ideology of sorts, but Hitler's dictatorship was largely personal and agenda-based.
[00:27:39.718 --> 00:27:44.422]  The dictatorship that emerged from the Bolshevik Revolution was based on ideology.
[00:27:44.522 --> 00:27:50.948]  Lenin declared that the Communist Party's dictatorship over the Russian people rests directly on force...
[00:27:51.648 --> 00:27:56.669]  Not limited by anything, not restricted by laws or any absolute rules.
[00:27:57.089 --> 00:28:00.450]  Exactly what Alberto Gonzalez and John Wu say.
[00:28:01.671 --> 00:28:09.253]  Or John Yu, excuse me, one of the chief counsels of Bush, saying they can torture children and crush their genitalia if they wish in front of their parents.
[00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:18.875]  Stalin's dictatorship over the Communist Party was based on coercion alone, unrestrained by any limitations or inhibitions.
[00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:27.037]  In the first decade of the 21st century, the United States regards itself as a land of democracy and civil liberty.
[00:28:27.337 --> 00:28:36.026]  But in fact, in an incipient dictatorship, ideology plays only a limited role in the emerging dictatorship.
[00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:44.271]  The demise of the American democracy, or our republic, is largely the result of historical developments.
[00:28:44.912 --> 00:28:46.752]  Lincoln was the first American tyrant.
[00:28:46.812 --> 00:28:50.333]  Lincoln justified his tyranny in the name of preserving the Union.
[00:28:50.653 --> 00:28:58.596]  His extra-legal, extra-constitutional methods were tolerated in order to suppress northern opposition to Lincoln's war against the southern secession.
[00:28:59.116 --> 00:29:01.301]  The first major lasting assault in the U.S.
[00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:06.912]  Constitution, separation of powers, which is the basis of our political system, came with a response
[00:29:07.984 --> 00:29:11.686]  Of the Roosevelt administration to the crisis of the Great Depression.
[00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:19.549]  The New Deal resulted in the Congress deleting its legislative powers and delegating them to the executive branch.
[00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:29.093]  Today, when Congress passes a statute, it is little more than an authorization for an executive agency to make the law by writing the regulations that implement it.
[00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:33.395]  We will continue with crossing the Rubicon.
[00:29:33.455 --> 00:29:35.156]  Bush has crossed the Rubicon.
[00:29:36.204 --> 00:29:37.985]  The New World Order has crossed it.
[00:29:39.646 --> 00:29:41.166]  The point of no return.
[00:29:42.027 --> 00:29:47.729]  Because they're so criminal, the globalists are, Bush is their puppet, that if they don't keep pushing, they're all going to go to jail.
[00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:49.490]  So the battle will be joined.
[00:29:51.891 --> 00:29:52.791]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.272 --> 00:29:54.872]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.892 --> 00:29:58.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.795 --> 00:30:05.777]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[00:30:06.217 --> 00:30:09.698]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[00:30:10.139 --> 00:30:13.360]  Cardavite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.342]  Made from seven herbs, Cardavite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[00:30:18.362 --> 00:30:20.323]  Here's what one person has to say.
[00:30:20.663 --> 00:30:24.344]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[00:30:24.484 --> 00:30:28.325]  I don't have the tightness on my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[00:30:28.545 --> 00:30:29.725]  I've tried all kinds of junk.
[00:30:29.945 --> 00:30:30.445]  It didn't do.
[00:30:30.546 --> 00:30:32.566]  The only thing that worked was your cardiovite.
[00:30:32.926 --> 00:30:35.267]  If you believe cardiovite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.

[00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:24.155]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:31:24.475 --> 00:31:33.824]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:34.084 --> 00:31:37.587]  It even reduces Radon 222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:32:01.894 --> 00:32:04.236]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:04.477 --> 00:32:06.519]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:06.679 --> 00:32:13.745]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:32:13.986 --> 00:32:22.534]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:32:22.894 --> 00:32:27.579]  Now for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:32:27.719 --> 00:32:31.763]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.

[00:32:49.879 --> 00:32:52.261]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:33:17.259 --> 00:33:31.754]  I don't have time to read this entire article, Bush has crossed the Rubicon, by Paul Craig Roberts, but it's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:33:31.794 --> 00:33:39.282]  But he goes through the process of how the executive has been strengthened and strengthened and strengthened and become more and more powerful.
[00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:50.137]  And now, we played that clip yesterday of Arlen Specter going, I'm going to really get tough on Bush, who Bush pushed to be appointed as committee chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a very powerful committee.
[00:33:51.478 --> 00:33:55.641]  Because if that committee's corrupt, basically then the executive can do whatever it wants.
[00:33:55.721 --> 00:33:57.862]  So, Specter is their man.
[00:33:57.882 --> 00:33:58.703]  He's always been their man.
[00:33:58.723 --> 00:34:00.464]  But he says, we'll see.
[00:34:00.504 --> 00:34:09.891]  You know, I think he may have overstepped on this, but he may just have total command, and he may just be able to have total executive control and be above all laws.
[00:34:10.862 --> 00:34:12.382]  That's what he said, in essence.
[00:34:13.243 --> 00:34:17.504]  He said, we're going to examine that in these hearings as if it needs to be examined.
[00:34:17.524 --> 00:34:29.927]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, common sense, jurisprudence, common law, our entire history, the Federalist Papers, all of the different federal laws show it's totally illegal.
[00:34:30.147 --> 00:34:31.628]  The President can't rob banks.
[00:34:31.668 --> 00:34:32.548]  The President can't
[00:34:33.977 --> 00:34:35.398]  Bomb schools if he wants to.
[00:34:35.438 --> 00:34:41.022]  The president can't run a casino off the White House lawn, at least publicly.
[00:34:43.484 --> 00:34:55.912]  So if the president can't drive 120 miles an hour while drinking Jack Daniels through a school zone, then how can he violate and break federal law and then say, I'm the president, I can break any law I want?
[00:34:57.231 --> 00:35:05.278]  And listen, people pointed Al Gore coming out and saying it's a police state, the Constitution's been shredded, Bush is trying to be a dictator.
[00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:07.340]  Bush says, no, I'm not a dictator.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.084]  And they say, well, Al Gore and Bill Clinton helped set up a police state, and that's right.
[00:35:12.445 --> 00:35:16.068]  It just gets worse each successive administration.
[00:35:17.458 --> 00:35:26.143]  Because that was the plan all along by the powerful financial institutions that own and run our country to a great extent and are gaining more control every day.
[00:35:26.203 --> 00:35:34.147]  They want us as an engine, as a tool to be their creature for larger global domination and hegemony.
[00:35:35.027 --> 00:35:36.028]  A larger hegemon.
[00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:38.809]  And that is exactly what's happening.
[00:35:39.129 --> 00:35:46.253]  And now it's not just Alex Jones 10 years ago screaming bloody murder about this as I saw all of the preparations.
[00:35:47.282 --> 00:35:55.028]  Now is the general public and many prominent people who are honestly looking at what's happening and what's being declared and what's being done.
[00:35:55.048 --> 00:36:03.454]  I mean, when I learned in 1998 that the Army had approached... Let me give you one example.
[00:36:03.774 --> 00:36:07.357]  Thomas Sanchez, Vietnam veteran, patriot, conservative...
[00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:17.579]  Hispanic American down in South Texas in Kingsville, they approached him and they said, we're preparing for martial law to take over America and confiscate guns.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.920]  We'd like you to take part in this drill.
[00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:24.802]  And he said, get out of my office and started calling the press.
[00:36:24.862 --> 00:36:27.803]  And he was on local Texas news.
[00:36:28.244 --> 00:36:31.345]  He was on the 700 Club of all places.
[00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:35.046]  He was on this radio show.
[00:36:35.566 --> 00:36:36.947]  We went down and interviewed him as well.
[00:36:38.234 --> 00:36:45.900]  And then we interviewed the police chief next door in Alice, who just said, yeah, I did the drill, and yeah, there were foreign troops, but I'm not going to talk to you about it.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.623]  We can't let you know our tactics, because you're the enemy.
[00:36:49.844 --> 00:36:55.769]  And then the chief of police in San Antonio, they tried to bribe him, he threw him out, said what they were doing was unconstitutional.
[00:36:56.589 --> 00:36:57.110]  Didn't matter.
[00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:05.557]  They then went back to the mayor, paid him a bunch of money, gave a bunch of money to the city, so the city then agreed to scale down urban warfare drills.
[00:37:05.917 --> 00:37:07.118]  But what were those drills for?
[00:37:07.939 --> 00:37:19.069]  They told the local public servants, they told the officials, who I guess still back in the late 90s had their heads screwed on partially straight, that this is to take over America.
[00:37:19.449 --> 00:37:21.991]  Now listen, I don't need to hear that from Thomas Sanchez.
[00:37:24.974 --> 00:37:28.217]  I don't need to hear that from Allie Philippus.
[00:37:28.297 --> 00:37:29.338]  I don't need to hear that.
[00:37:29.778 --> 00:37:35.363]  I went to the urban warfare drills in South Texas, in Central Texas, in Northern California.
[00:37:36.733 --> 00:37:40.175]  I've been to the drills in Florida, Brooksville, Florida.
[00:37:40.335 --> 00:37:42.596]  I've been chased by special forces.
[00:37:42.976 --> 00:37:44.197]  I've had them arrest me.
[00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:46.318]  I've had them detain me.
[00:37:46.658 --> 00:37:49.399]  I've had them grab tapes out of cameras and erase them.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.922]  I've had them laugh at me and say, we've been watching you the whole time.
[00:37:54.202 --> 00:37:56.583]  I've had them parked outside my hotel room.
[00:37:57.746 --> 00:38:13.196]  All because I wanted to get you video of them training to jerk your little kids away from you and strip you down naked and shower you and get you all ready and make sure you're sanitary for the camp for your safety.
[00:38:17.555 --> 00:38:23.699]  And the Marines even let me videotape in one case where they got wise to me as they were doing mock interrogations.
[00:38:23.739 --> 00:38:24.439]  Where are you from?
[00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:25.520]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.881]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[00:38:26.921 --> 00:38:27.901]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:29.402]  Why are you resisting us?
[00:38:29.422 --> 00:38:31.643]  And then all of a sudden, what was his name?
[00:38:31.683 --> 00:38:33.745]  Richard Jones, their PR guy, runs over.
[00:38:33.785 --> 00:38:34.565]  Back off, Jones!
[00:38:34.585 --> 00:38:35.346]  You can't take this!
[00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:36.726]  I said you can't take that!
[00:38:40.008 --> 00:38:42.030]  And then people saw the footage in Police State 2000.
[00:38:43.749 --> 00:38:56.114]  Of the Marines in Hebron, Maryland with 12-year-old kids working for them, asking the kids, go tell us who owns guns in your neighborhood, doing these drills, practicing taking over the police station.
[00:38:57.225 --> 00:39:01.768]  I mean, I saw all of that, so I started freaking out about it until people got sick of it.
[00:39:02.068 --> 00:39:07.311]  We don't want to hear about martial law or the end of posse commentatus or the military being used in America.
[00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:08.312]  That'll never happen.
[00:39:08.352 --> 00:39:11.994]  Now, Governor Ridge announced Governor Cher Totler on TV.
[00:39:12.254 --> 00:39:14.195]  Getting rid of posse commentatus is good.
[00:39:14.656 --> 00:39:17.417]  Getting rid of posse commentatus would fix the problems in Katrina.
[00:39:17.697 --> 00:39:18.278]  We need...
[00:39:19.105 --> 00:39:34.631]  Federal police, the Viper teams from all over the country searching people and doing random checkpoints and federal grants to have police go out in riot gear and surround businesses and just randomly search everyone, training you how to be a slave.
[00:39:38.033 --> 00:39:41.474]  And listen, a lot of people think they control reality in their heads.
[00:39:41.494 --> 00:39:47.977]  They think if they just deny what I'm saying, that somehow that makes it go away.
[00:39:49.957 --> 00:39:56.344]  I can assure you, if you're in debt, just turning on the television and sucking your thumb and eating another cheeseburger isn't going to make it go away.
[00:39:58.106 --> 00:40:08.277]  If you, let's say, have got too much salt intake and you're sick and the doctor says you've got to quit eating as much salt, just saying, oh, everything will be fine and eating more salt isn't going to help you.
[00:40:09.538 --> 00:40:10.119]  It's simple.
[00:40:10.718 --> 00:40:14.341]  If your house is a mess, just wishing it to be clean won't make it go away.
[00:40:14.842 --> 00:40:19.626]  You've got to roll up your sleeves, decide it's going to be fun, and get in there and clean the house.
[00:40:19.646 --> 00:40:22.909]  You've got to decide it's going to be fun and get on that stair stepper.
[00:40:23.249 --> 00:40:27.713]  You've got to decide it's going to be fun and go get a second job and stop wasting so much money.
[00:40:27.994 --> 00:40:31.697]  And then it's going to feel good to get out of debt and to end up having more money in your bank account.
[00:40:33.929 --> 00:40:38.952]  You're not going to raise good children just hoping they grow up right and letting the government schools raise them.
[00:40:38.972 --> 00:40:40.593]  They're going to end up bad on average.
[00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:42.734]  I mean, you're really putting them in harm's way.
[00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:46.657]  I wouldn't play Russian roulette with a cylinder with six holes in it.
[00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:48.898]  You've got three bullets in it, basically.
[00:40:48.918 --> 00:40:49.298]  50-50.
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.660]  I'm not trying to preach here, folks.
[00:40:52.701 --> 00:40:53.821]  This is just common sense.
[00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:56.203]  The stuff I'm saying was figured out a long time ago.
[00:40:56.803 --> 00:40:57.583]  I'm just repeating it.
[00:40:58.144 --> 00:41:00.385]  And I've experienced it, so I know it's verifiable.
[00:41:00.665 --> 00:41:01.646]  I know it's demonstratable.
[00:41:03.593 --> 00:41:09.734]  So just wishing and hoping the government wasn't going bad, and I mean going bad in a really bad way, not just a good old boy corruption.
[00:41:10.694 --> 00:41:11.975]  It went bad a long time ago.
[00:41:12.315 --> 00:41:13.535]  It went bad from the start.
[00:41:13.575 --> 00:41:16.876]  That's the nature of man, and so it's the nature of governments magnified.
[00:41:19.676 --> 00:41:21.817]  But it's getting really bad.
[00:41:21.857 --> 00:41:23.657]  I mean, it's going as bad as it could go.
[00:41:23.737 --> 00:41:28.838]  It's going bad in a focused, scientifically crafted way.
[00:41:30.359 --> 00:41:36.985]  And going along with it, licking its boots and kissing up to it, isn't going to protect you, it isn't going to protect me, it isn't going to protect any of us.
[00:41:41.449 --> 00:41:46.774]  And it really, at the end of the day, in the final equation, comes down to that.
[00:41:48.136 --> 00:41:50.197]  You know Big Brother's out of control.
[00:41:50.338 --> 00:41:52.299]  You know the dollar's been devalued.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.863]  You know the economy isn't doing as good as it was doing ten years ago.
[00:41:57.336 --> 00:42:21.373]  Regardless of what the mainstream media says, all the key indicators of the debt, corporate, private, federal, state, all the indicators of test scores, all the indicators of truancy, and the indicators of illegitimacy in births, and the indicators of sexually transmitted diseases, and the indicators at every level, we're going bad, we're going bad in a big way.
[00:42:23.906 --> 00:42:33.589]  And the salve of sports and the salve of sex and the salve of porno and the salve of drugs and liquor, none of it is going to gloss it over.
[00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:35.390]  It's just going to make it worse.
[00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.751]  It might distract you and divert you for a minute.
[00:42:39.031 --> 00:42:43.092]  I mean, entertainment even advertises itself as a distraction now.
[00:42:43.452 --> 00:42:45.113]  Well, we're the opposite of entertainment.
[00:42:45.805 --> 00:43:00.488]  I guess you could call it infotainment if you wanted to, but I mean, there's nothing more energizing if you just want what you'd call stimulation than actually knowing the truth and really being aware and watching the grand chessboard that is the planet Earth.
[00:43:00.548 --> 00:43:11.370]  Now, I want to go to your calls and get into a bunch of news, and we have some guests coming up today, but I know that Bert and John and Michael and Mark and John and others are holding, but let me just finish with some of what Paul Craig Roberts was saying.
[00:43:14.522 --> 00:43:25.593]  President Bush has used signing statements hundreds of times to talk about the message and the meaning of statutes passed by Congress.
[00:43:25.613 --> 00:43:36.343]  In effect, Bush is vetoing the bills he signs into law by asserting unilateral authority as commander in chief to bypass or set aside the laws he signs.
[00:43:36.603 --> 00:43:39.226]  He says, I'm signing this, but I don't have to follow it.
[00:43:39.815 --> 00:43:56.442]  For example, Bush has asserted that he has the power to ignore the McCain Amendment against torture, to ignore the law that requires a warrant to spy on Americans, to ignore the prohibition against indefinite detention without charges or trial, and to ignore the Geneva Conventions to which the U.S.
[00:43:56.962 --> 00:43:57.923]  is a signatory.
[00:43:58.323 --> 00:44:00.784]  But then people say, but we're doing this to fight terrorists.
[00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:07.689]  And then you find out he's just setting the precedent that really the FISA court is really unconstitutional and there's no warrant there.
[00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:08.910]  It's retroactive.
[00:44:09.131 --> 00:44:12.133]  And then you learn who's really behind the terror and then things really make sense.
[00:44:13.635 --> 00:44:17.658]  In effect, Bush is asserting the powers that accrued to Hitler in 1933.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:28.903]  His Federalist Society, apologists of the Department of Justice appointed, claimed that President Bush has the same power to interpret the Constitution as the Supreme Court.
[00:44:29.443 --> 00:44:33.004]  An Alito court is likely to agree with this false claim.
[00:44:35.485 --> 00:44:40.146]  Well, I've read the papers of Alito as a judge, and boy, he believes in total dictatorship.
[00:44:41.126 --> 00:44:43.967]  I don't care what he says in front of Congress now, because he's in trouble for it.
[00:44:44.736 --> 00:44:47.117]  This is the greatest issue that is before the country.
[00:44:47.717 --> 00:44:52.579]  But it is pushed into the background by political battles over abortion and homosexual rights.
[00:44:52.659 --> 00:44:59.322]  Many people fighting to strengthen the executive think they are fighting against legitimizing sodomy and murder in the womb.
[00:44:59.642 --> 00:45:07.245]  They are unaware that the real issue is that America is on the verge of elevating its president above the law.
[00:45:07.885 --> 00:45:08.486]  Exactly.
[00:45:08.526 --> 00:45:10.227]  And Bush isn't going to get rid of any of that stuff.
[00:45:10.247 --> 00:45:11.267]  He's promised you he will.
[00:45:11.607 --> 00:45:15.710]  Oh, if he's a dictator, he can stop this and he can beat those evil liberals.
[00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:21.433]  You mean all the gay porn stars and gay escort whores in the White House?
[00:45:21.453 --> 00:45:24.855]  You mean those that are literally running out of there like rats every night?
[00:45:25.236 --> 00:45:27.257]  Just spilling out of there in Bohemian Grove?
[00:45:28.037 --> 00:45:31.299]  The top gay porn star services, Christian conservative leaders.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.881]  New York Post headline, but it's okay.
[00:45:35.022 --> 00:45:37.243]  The actual headline is gay porn star services moguls.
[00:45:37.842 --> 00:45:38.963]  But who is the Bohemian Grove?
[00:45:38.983 --> 00:45:42.125]  The conservative pantheon, the conservative Senate.
[00:45:42.745 --> 00:45:49.970]  Bush Justice Department official and Berkeley law professor John Yoo argues that no law can restrict the president in his role as commander-in-chief.
[00:45:50.311 --> 00:46:00.678]  Thus, once the president is at war, even a vague open-ended war on terror, Bush Justice Department says the president is free to undertake any action in pursuit of war, including the torture of children.
[00:46:01.701 --> 00:46:14.533]  And he didn't mention that he can... I mean, imagine you being up on the stage in front of thousands of people in Chicago debating a fighting Irish professor, and the professor says, well, you wrote that you can torture people's children in front of them and crush their testicles.
[00:46:14.893 --> 00:46:16.515]  And you say, yes, the president can do that.
[00:46:17.155 --> 00:46:23.361]  I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer then is okay, folks, including the torture of children and indefinite detention of American citizens.
[00:46:24.591 --> 00:46:30.977]  The commander-in-chief role is probably sufficiently elastic to expand any crisis, whether real or fabricated.
[00:46:31.317 --> 00:46:32.398]  This has the U.S.
[00:46:33.158 --> 00:46:35.360]  arrived at the verge of a dictatorship.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.741]  Again, thus the U.S.
[00:46:37.122 --> 00:46:38.883]  has arrived at the verge of a dictatorship.
[00:46:39.464 --> 00:46:52.655]  This is a development that has little to do with Bush, who was unlikely to be aware that the Constitution is experiencing its final rending or its death on his watch.
[00:46:53.297 --> 00:47:05.646]  America's descent into dictatorship is the result of historical developments and old political battles dating back to President Nixon being driven from office by a Democratic Congress.
[00:47:06.227 --> 00:47:08.348]  There is today no constitutional party.
[00:47:08.428 --> 00:47:18.876]  Both political parties are most constitutional lawyers and the Bar Association are willing to set aside the Constitution whenever it interferes with their agendas.
[00:47:19.176 --> 00:47:22.399]  Yeah, the National Bar Association says abolish juries, folks.
[00:47:23.297 --> 00:47:24.558]  Just type that in to Google.
[00:47:25.718 --> 00:47:27.439]  Last place I saw it was Chicago Tribune.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:36.104]  Americans have forgotten the prestigiousness for freedom and the prerequisites for freedom.
[00:47:36.564 --> 00:47:41.927]  And those pursuing power have forgotten what it means when it falls into the hands...
[00:47:43.446 --> 00:47:44.327]  Of dictators.
[00:47:44.547 --> 00:47:49.331]  Americans are very close to losing their constitutional system and civil liberties.
[00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:59.639]  It is a paradox that American democracy is the likely casualty of a war on terror that is being justified in the name of expansion of democracy.
[00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:06.625]  Now I would just add the reason I babbled through a few of those is sometimes I print stuff and it prints and cuts off the last word.
[00:48:06.645 --> 00:48:10.268]  So I was having to imagine at the end of each sentence
[00:48:11.002 --> 00:48:12.083]  What the word was.
[00:48:12.203 --> 00:48:17.347]  So a few times I would imagine it incorrectly and then read the rest of the sentence and figure out what the word really was.
[00:48:17.407 --> 00:48:20.969]  So that's why you'd hear me say one word and then go back and say another.
[00:48:20.989 --> 00:48:29.095]  I tell you, I don't know how sometimes even on our own website we format it right and I hit printer friendly up there and it just doesn't matter.
[00:48:29.515 --> 00:48:30.376]  Side issue.
[00:48:30.396 --> 00:48:35.099]  I'm not the best newsreader to begin with but nobody can read something when it's like that.
[00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:37.440]  But still, very informative.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.260]  A lot of that wasn't what Roberts had said.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.781]  I was stopping and adding historical references to all of it.
[00:48:43.021 --> 00:48:43.882]  Let's go to some calls.
[00:48:43.942 --> 00:48:45.262]  Burton in Louisiana.
[00:48:45.282 --> 00:48:45.762]  Go ahead, Burton.
[00:48:46.082 --> 00:48:46.823]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:48:46.963 --> 00:48:47.283]  Good, sir.
[00:48:47.303 --> 00:48:47.803]  Good show.
[00:48:47.963 --> 00:48:54.325]  Look, I was watching History Channel last night, and they said that Lincoln was the biggest dictator that we ever had.
[00:48:54.885 --> 00:48:59.727]  Some of the things that they showed, Bush is doing the exact same thing that Lincoln did, but that's not why I'm calling.
[00:48:59.787 --> 00:49:00.187]  Wait a minute.
[00:49:00.247 --> 00:49:01.508]  They were advertising that?
[00:49:01.548 --> 00:49:05.309]  Because Bush is saying, because Lincoln arrested...
[00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:10.705]  Governors, congressmen, I mean, the leaders in Illinois.
[00:49:10.725 --> 00:49:14.466]  Cut newspapers down and arrest them.
[00:49:14.526 --> 00:49:20.028]  Hundreds and hundreds of newspapers that suddenly it's okay and that Bush may do that.
[00:49:20.508 --> 00:49:22.609]  Yeah, this was on Discovery Channel last night.
[00:49:22.629 --> 00:49:26.330]  They literally said he was the biggest dictated president we ever had.
[00:49:27.626 --> 00:49:34.248]  And by the way, he gave multiple speeches where he said that it was not about slavery and that he did not want to free black Americans.
[00:49:34.668 --> 00:49:36.509]  And I'm against slavery, folks, and against what happened.
[00:49:36.529 --> 00:49:39.049]  But I'm just telling you, Lincoln was a fraud.
[00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.110]  But I'm going to add something.
[00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.391]  So was the South.
[00:49:43.471 --> 00:49:48.032]  You see, in every one of these issues we face, most people think it's either or.
[00:49:48.512 --> 00:49:49.572]  No, it was both.
[00:49:49.692 --> 00:49:51.293]  The globalists are masters.
[00:49:51.833 --> 00:49:54.794]  Now, I'm not saying the South didn't have real grievances or real problems.
[00:49:55.407 --> 00:50:03.173]  And it was about the unfair tariffs and industrialization of the North and the scams on the South and their agriculture.
[00:50:04.274 --> 00:50:05.815]  And who would control Western expansion?
[00:50:06.216 --> 00:50:10.759]  But the British government, the bloody British, we fought two separate times, 1812 and of course 1776.
[00:50:13.471 --> 00:50:17.956]  They came in and paid, and paid off the South, and antagonized the whole thing.
[00:50:18.517 --> 00:50:22.681]  So it was a larger plan to put us into shambles.
[00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:23.162]  But go ahead.
[00:50:23.782 --> 00:50:27.006]  What I want to ask, I read this little article on your website about...
[00:50:27.905 --> 00:50:31.506]  MS-13, and in the article it said 20,000 members.
[00:50:31.566 --> 00:50:44.470]  Now what I'm trying to get to is I'm from Chicago originally, and you got the Latin keys with another 50,000 members, the disciples with another 30 or 40,000 members, and I think it constitutes numbers.
[00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.911]  A gang is constituted if 500 members are left.
[00:50:47.971 --> 00:50:48.911]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:49.071 --> 00:50:50.592]  It constitutes armies.
[00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:52.671]  It doesn't constitute gangs.
[00:50:52.731 --> 00:50:53.131]  Stay there.
[00:50:53.171 --> 00:50:57.433]  I want you to be able to finish up Burton and John, Michael, Mark, John, everybody else.
[00:50:57.473 --> 00:50:58.173]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:50:58.193 --> 00:51:01.034]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.494 --> 00:51:09.876]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.136 --> 00:51:14.877]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.097 --> 00:51:20.739]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.979 --> 00:51:21.720]  We're good to go.
[00:51:47.278 --> 00:51:48.299]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:48.540]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:14.531]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:21.197]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:52:21.437 --> 00:52:22.719]  To below detectable levels.
[00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:26.923]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:27.163 --> 00:52:33.691]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:33.911 --> 00:52:39.397]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:39.637 --> 00:52:46.561]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:52:46.782 --> 00:52:50.724]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:53.446]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:53.466 --> 00:52:54.646]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:08.434]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.654 --> 00:53:10.915]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.115 --> 00:53:17.457]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.837 --> 00:53:18.458]  We're good to go.
[00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:34.259]  We're good to go.
[00:53:34.279 --> 00:53:34.780]  We're good to go.
[00:54:02.715 --> 00:54:07.859]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.539 --> 00:54:10.881]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:12.623 --> 00:54:20.809]  For those that don't know, MS-13 has had bounties on Border Patrol and other police for at least five years, I'm aware of.
[00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:21.990]  They've killed quite a few.
[00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.833]  Last year, on the border, on our side, 15 dead cops died.
[00:54:27.446 --> 00:54:28.747]  But it's kept real quiet.
[00:54:28.767 --> 00:54:36.130]  Anybody who even tries to go down there with binoculars and call police when these drug dealers and human smugglers come across.
[00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.691]  Bush has called them evil vigilantes.
[00:54:38.731 --> 00:54:39.691]  They've been demonized.
[00:54:40.252 --> 00:54:46.754]  The feds have been down there trying to set up good Americans, black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter, who just go down there and try to defend us.
[00:54:47.275 --> 00:54:49.796]  And then, yeah, there's hundreds of thousands of these different...
[00:54:51.536 --> 00:54:51.876]  We're good to go.
[00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:10.333]  You know, this is your country, the whites are all evil, take over.
[00:55:10.354 --> 00:55:15.179]  But those gangs ought to ask themselves then, why is all this big money funding you?
[00:55:15.219 --> 00:55:16.060]  Why are they behind it?
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.041]  You're just being set up.
[00:55:17.622 --> 00:55:19.163]  You're going to lose in the end, don't worry.
[00:55:19.203 --> 00:55:23.829]  But in your destruction, they'll even use that for more of the police state crackdown.
[00:55:24.249 --> 00:55:26.452]  But then the illegal aliens will just keep pouring across.
[00:55:27.239 --> 00:55:29.582]  So it's all very sophisticated.
[00:55:29.962 --> 00:55:31.283]  Bert, go ahead and finish up.
[00:55:31.924 --> 00:55:41.013]  What I want to know is why this government keeps considering gangs when they're actually armies and you're not supposed to assemble another army in the United States of America.
[00:55:41.053 --> 00:55:48.921]  Isn't there something in the Constitution that we should assemble a mercenary or missionary army here and take over these folks, or what?
[00:55:49.301 --> 00:55:52.422]  I mean, we've got to fight and get our country back.
[00:55:52.942 --> 00:55:54.443]  Well, that's the thing, you see, though.
[00:55:54.483 --> 00:55:59.424]  It's perfect because they predominantly speak Spanish, so no one knows it's going on.
[00:55:59.484 --> 00:56:01.825]  No one can read the billboards that openly announce it.
[00:56:02.265 --> 00:56:04.106]  Hundreds, what, 600-plus in L.A.
[00:56:04.366 --> 00:56:04.926]  saying L.A.
[00:56:04.966 --> 00:56:05.647]  is Mexico?
[00:56:05.867 --> 00:56:06.647]  And who put it up?
[00:56:07.127 --> 00:56:09.868]  The white owner of the TV network.
[00:56:10.328 --> 00:56:12.269]  You see, but notice that.
[00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:13.569]  See, notice who's behind it.
[00:56:14.169 --> 00:56:18.351]  Empires always want to play us off against each other, and your point is well taken.
[00:56:18.671 --> 00:56:29.455]  We're hearing we've got to live under a microscope, not have any rights, have Viper teams shake us down at the mall, federal troops, but the border's going to be wide open, and we're going to let gangs kill cops.
[00:56:30.217 --> 00:56:31.477]  Exactly.
[00:56:31.497 --> 00:56:32.658]  But don't worry your kid.
[00:56:32.738 --> 00:56:37.498]  Your kid, though, because there was a school shooting in 1999, the schools are going to be total prisons.
[00:56:37.799 --> 00:56:39.399]  Well, it isn't about keeping your kids safe.
[00:56:39.839 --> 00:56:42.860]  It's about turning the kids into little federal brainwashing camps.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:50.201]  And so, again, the government isn't worried about a real war zone that the State Department admits is more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel.
[00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:55.502]  South Texas, in the border region, is more dangerous than areas of Israel.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:01.729]  Well, what I'm trying to get to is, isn't there something in the Constitution that says that you're not allowed to assemble?
[00:57:02.327 --> 00:57:04.528]  Other armies in the United States of America?
[00:57:05.128 --> 00:57:12.130]  Well, I mean, there are hundreds of federal laws that say that these corporations can't steal $6 trillion.
[00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:13.170]  I keep saying $3 trillion.
[00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:14.710]  That was years ago's number.
[00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:18.211]  $6 trillion from the Pentagon pension funds.
[00:57:18.251 --> 00:57:19.192]  Everything's gone now.
[00:57:19.232 --> 00:57:20.452]  They've just stolen everything.
[00:57:20.712 --> 00:57:22.493]  I'm talking about the people of America.
[00:57:22.693 --> 00:57:23.793]  Why don't we realize this?
[00:57:23.813 --> 00:57:30.655]  Because we've learned to be jellyfish and wait for the government to do it, and the government's our mommy, the opposite of what America's supposed to be.
[00:57:31.175 --> 00:57:31.395]  Okay.
[00:57:31.435 --> 00:57:33.656]  And another thing, look, Alex, I live here in Louisiana.
[00:57:33.676 --> 00:57:37.498]  I went down to Katrina down there, and let me tell you what's going on down there.
[00:57:37.938 --> 00:57:39.879]  I went down there last week.
[00:57:39.959 --> 00:57:42.420]  You've got these salesmen going in to sell these jobs.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:56.185]  They're selling the jobs for a minimal amount of money, and they're making sure they sell the jobs so they get a commission, and then the owners are taking the other money, and what you have left down there as workers, and I swear to you, is crackheads.
[00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.551]  And Crystal Maphead's doing the job.
[00:57:58.871 --> 00:58:06.275]  The jobs are so horrible that the people are just up in arms down there.
[00:58:06.295 --> 00:58:06.575]  I hear you.
[00:58:06.595 --> 00:58:07.576]  I appreciate the call.
[00:58:08.637 --> 00:58:13.499]  Actually, Halliburton hired tens of thousands of illegal aliens publicly.
[00:58:13.559 --> 00:58:16.461]  Bush even changed the law with an executive move.
[00:58:16.901 --> 00:58:18.762]  Remember where they don't have to verify employment?
[00:58:19.591 --> 00:58:23.735]  And then Halliburton even ripped off all the Mexicans and wouldn't pay them.
[00:58:24.175 --> 00:58:27.318]  And just in the news, yeah, we hired illegals and we're not going to pay them.
[00:58:27.898 --> 00:58:28.559]  We're the government.
[00:58:28.979 --> 00:58:29.620]  We're Halliburton.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.440]  We kidnap children.
[00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:34.944]  Really, you didn't hear about that in the Chicago Tribune about Halliburton involving the child kidnapping too?
[00:58:35.384 --> 00:58:36.565]  Yeah, they're real nice.
[00:58:36.886 --> 00:58:39.008]  It's called Criminals Taking Over.
[00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:46.194]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7777.
[00:58:58.206 --> 00:58:58.866]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.506 --> 00:59:00.587]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.287 --> 00:59:02.388]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.028 --> 00:59:03.868]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:06.530]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.991]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.351 --> 00:59:14.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.853 --> 00:59:17.114]  The global overlords are beating the drum.
[00:59:17.655 --> 00:59:20.516]  Mucho grande big time to invade Iran...
[00:59:22.535 --> 00:59:27.998]  The communist Chinese government suppressing their population in mass riots and the police are shooting and beating people to death.
[00:59:28.458 --> 00:59:29.118]  We'll get into that.
[00:59:29.218 --> 00:59:34.120]  Sybil Edmonds, NSA whistleblower, is coming up later in this hour.
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.321]  Wide open phones right now.
[00:59:35.341 --> 00:59:36.221]  Let's go back to your calls.
[00:59:36.602 --> 00:59:37.502]  John in New Jersey.
[00:59:37.542 --> 00:59:38.202]  Go ahead, John.
[00:59:38.763 --> 00:59:40.543]  WWF changed to WWE.
[00:59:40.563 --> 00:59:44.045]  There was a court case between the World Wrestling Federation and the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:59:44.885 --> 00:59:47.927]  Okay, so you're mad that I'm talking bad about wrestling?
[00:59:47.967 --> 00:59:49.447]  Or what's this call about?
[00:59:49.467 --> 00:59:50.488]  Uh, uh...
[00:59:51.109 --> 01:00:03.856]  You said that you like in the global elite how they set up like a wrestling match, and you mentioned WWF, but they changed their name to the World Wrestling, Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment or something.
[01:00:04.257 --> 01:00:07.298]  Okay, I really don't follow it.
[01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:14.883]  The whole point is that politics at the national level is staged like so-called pro wrestling, yes.
[01:00:16.772 --> 01:00:18.754]  Also, what happened with John Joe Gray?
[01:00:18.774 --> 01:00:20.115]  He said you sold out on him.
[01:00:20.295 --> 01:00:21.796]  I read an article on the internet.
[01:00:21.937 --> 01:00:23.598]  Yeah, it's just totally untrue.
[01:00:23.758 --> 01:00:24.198]  All of it.
[01:00:24.278 --> 01:00:25.099]  Total fantasy.
[01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:28.242]  I mean, I heard you were selling green cheese from the moon.
[01:00:28.622 --> 01:00:29.823]  That has as much validity.
[01:00:29.863 --> 01:00:31.704]  Thank you for the call, John.
[01:00:32.165 --> 01:00:33.186]  That was really nice.
[01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:39.410]  I noticed that you also are really up on pro wrestling, so that's a good thing.
[01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:43.634]  And again, I can get those calls every few weeks, you know.
[01:00:44.785 --> 01:00:47.647]  Answer for the fact that you're the head of Scientology.
[01:00:47.667 --> 01:00:52.851]  Because there's a 56-year-old man named Alex Jones who is a PR person for him.
[01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:57.554]  And no, if you want to believe I'm a 56-year-old man and the head of Scientology, go ahead.
[01:00:58.134 --> 01:00:58.815]  Okay, I am.
[01:00:59.155 --> 01:00:59.455]  Good.
[01:01:00.396 --> 01:01:06.700]  And I run around wearing a pirate's outfit robbing caravans in Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:08.581]  And I'm from Pluto.
[01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:11.463]  And people say, well, you need to answer this.
[01:01:12.244 --> 01:01:13.625]  I mean, consider the sources.
[01:01:14.344 --> 01:01:21.090]  The sources of the people saying stuff about me, either they're co-intel pro who just constantly lie about everyone or they're nuts.
[01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:24.834]  And so it's like, you need to answer this!
[01:01:24.974 --> 01:01:26.195]  I have answered that stuff.
[01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:30.519]  Just total, total fantasy, total theater.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:31.901]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:33.302]  I mean, I can just hear it in your voice.
[01:01:33.682 --> 01:01:37.166]  John, I'm not trying to be mean, but you just sound like a simpering buffoon.
[01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:39.468]  I mean, I don't mean to be mean.
[01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:41.250]  It was just WWE.
[01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.011]  I was like, okay, well, what else?
[01:01:43.031 --> 01:01:44.312]  I'm going to head back to this.
[01:01:44.793 --> 01:01:45.834]  I think you've called before.
[01:01:46.234 --> 01:01:47.095]  Michael in Denver.
[01:01:47.135 --> 01:01:47.475]  Go ahead.
[01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:48.036]  You're on the air.
[01:01:48.056 --> 01:01:49.257]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:49.337 --> 01:01:51.198]  First time caller, long time listener.
[01:01:51.218 --> 01:01:52.720]  Thank you for tuning in.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.082]  I love your show, and God bless you richly.
[01:01:56.183 --> 01:01:57.103]  I truly mean that.
[01:01:57.163 --> 01:01:57.644]  Thank you, sir.
[01:01:59.185 --> 01:02:08.230]  Just in regards to the gentleman who called yesterday, I am from New York originally and spent a lot of time in New York City.
[01:02:09.691 --> 01:02:22.838]  I usually listen to you for all of my stuff, but I went on to the Power Hour, which led me to the 911eyewitness.com.
[01:02:23.018 --> 01:02:27.661]  I got that video, and if he doesn't think there were bombs in that building...
[01:02:29.164 --> 01:02:33.607]  I don't know how big his crack pipe is, but that's pathetic.
[01:02:33.807 --> 01:02:41.692]  Because just on the site itself, 911eyewitness.com, and I hate plugging anything that's not yours.
[01:02:41.912 --> 01:02:43.673]  Oh, I don't ever mind people plug things.
[01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:49.456]  What I don't like is that the same caller will call every week and do the same thing, just a plug for their website.
[01:02:49.676 --> 01:02:53.999]  No, I just truly want people to learn the truth.
[01:02:54.972 --> 01:03:10.717]  I got this video, and this gentleman set up his camera on a tripod, and you can actually hear and see the dust and the bombs going off, and he puts a size... I mean, it's just an incredible video.
[01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:12.818]  It's incredible.
[01:03:12.898 --> 01:03:23.161]  Well, I appreciate that information, but I would just add to all of this that the caller yesterday, who doesn't think 9-11 was an inside job at any level...
[01:03:24.296 --> 01:03:27.177]  He was just trying to push my buttons, and I let him push my buttons.
[01:03:28.258 --> 01:03:38.922]  I mean, I guarantee you, that guy didn't work where he said he worked, and that guy wasn't being... He was being disingenuous, and he was claiming that I'd said things I hadn't said, and it just didn't matter to him.
[01:03:40.402 --> 01:03:42.603]  And so, at the end of the day, that's really what happened there.
[01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:43.283]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:43.683 --> 01:03:46.344]  We'll talk to Michael and Mark and Brett and many others when we get back.
[01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.726]  I mean, the official story is a complete fraud.
[01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.761]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.021 --> 01:03:59.602]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.943 --> 01:04:04.627]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.968 --> 01:04:11.714]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.015]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.215 --> 01:04:17.057]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.157 --> 01:04:21.800]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:26.402]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:33.886]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.126 --> 01:04:36.548]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:38.449]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:53.934 --> 01:04:57.395]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:57.675 --> 01:05:01.177]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:01.257 --> 01:05:05.198]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:05.438 --> 01:05:11.580]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:19.903]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:20.323 --> 01:05:25.667]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.827 --> 01:05:29.589]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:31.811]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.871 --> 01:05:34.032]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:34.272 --> 01:05:38.876]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:05:53.786 --> 01:05:58.150]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:05.076]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[01:06:05.563 --> 01:06:07.704]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[01:06:08.124 --> 01:06:14.127]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[01:06:14.688 --> 01:06:34.018]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversy surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:44.786]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:06:58.329 --> 01:06:58.970]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:00.711]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:02.532]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.172 --> 01:07:03.973]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:06.254]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:10.277]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.477 --> 01:07:14.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:21.264]  We've got Sybil Edmonds, NSA whistleblower, joining us.
[01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:24.026]  She's been barred from telling us what she discovered, but...
[01:07:25.493 --> 01:07:27.574]  She's able to, quote, talk about other cases.
[01:07:28.074 --> 01:07:33.816]  She'll go, well, you know about the classic cases of the CIA being caught shipping in drugs out of Southeast Asia?
[01:07:34.536 --> 01:07:36.416]  Well, that's what I'm not allowed to talk about.
[01:07:36.456 --> 01:07:39.777]  Well, you know the cases of organized crime being involved in the government?
[01:07:39.797 --> 01:07:41.438]  Well, that's what I'm not allowed to talk about.
[01:07:43.024 --> 01:07:45.306]  You know the cases of the government kidnapping children?
[01:07:45.346 --> 01:07:47.347]  Well, that's what I'm not allowed to talk about.
[01:07:47.968 --> 01:07:52.531]  She admittedly worked at the NSA, and they had her covering up all these NSA intercepts.
[01:07:52.551 --> 01:07:59.517]  See, the government gets snooped on by itself, one hand not knowing what the other's doing, because most of the government isn't evil.
[01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:00.778]  I mean, it's just average people.
[01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:03.460]  It's those key compartments, though, that are in control.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:12.044]  And so she was told to go cover up pre-9-11 intercepts of specific attacks that were coming.
[01:08:12.284 --> 01:08:14.325]  Of course, she was picking up their own op.
[01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:16.906]  And she refused to go along with it.
[01:08:18.107 --> 01:08:19.207]  And along with many others.
[01:08:19.587 --> 01:08:22.749]  So this is key information, and it's...
[01:08:23.562 --> 01:08:25.324]  It's a cornucopia of info.
[01:08:25.804 --> 01:08:28.526]  So we'll see if we can cover even the tip of the iceberg with her.
[01:08:28.966 --> 01:08:30.027]  But that's in 30 minutes.
[01:08:30.047 --> 01:08:31.949]  I need to get into the Iran-Iraq situation.
[01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:35.232]  I desperately need to get into all this huge stack of stuff.
[01:08:35.272 --> 01:08:37.333]  But let's rampage through your calls now.
[01:08:37.353 --> 01:08:39.135]  People have been holding long enough.
[01:08:39.295 --> 01:08:40.976]  Mark in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:08:41.356 --> 01:08:42.317]  You're on the air, Mark.
[01:08:42.377 --> 01:08:42.698]  Welcome.
[01:08:43.398 --> 01:08:43.678]  Yes.
[01:08:44.059 --> 01:08:46.961]  I've been looking forward to talking with you for a while.
[01:08:46.981 --> 01:08:49.263]  You were mentioned.
[01:08:49.283 --> 01:08:51.865]  I was at a John Birch meeting last night.
[01:08:52.546 --> 01:09:05.375]  And they mentioned that, you know, I was wondering about getting, we need to get more of a network, we need to get people together on this in terms of setting up links and getting people informed about what's going on.
[01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:13.580]  I mean, you understand that there's been a change in the management, the top level management of the John Burke Society recently.
[01:09:14.527 --> 01:09:15.448]  How did that happen?
[01:09:15.468 --> 01:09:27.975]  Because I know they've gotten very staid and very molasses-like, and so many of their members wanted to get active and grow and do things, and it seemed that was always stifled.
[01:09:28.635 --> 01:09:30.736]  And so I'm encouraged to hear about the change.
[01:09:30.796 --> 01:09:31.977]  What is the major change?
[01:09:33.998 --> 01:09:35.279]  Let me just finish.
[01:09:35.519 --> 01:09:36.860]  I'm ignorant on the particulars.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.601]  Well, I'd like to give you the particulars.
[01:09:40.241 --> 01:09:43.023]  On the 31st, there will be a conference here in Atlanta.
[01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:44.931]  That I'm planning on attending.
[01:09:45.391 --> 01:09:46.412]  I paid real money for it.
[01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:49.214]  The only thing I have is some silver eagles.
[01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:57.479]  I gave some silver eagles to my chapter leader and said, please take care of this because the bank has really screwed me over recently.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.022]  Anyway, the thing is that when I get more information, I'll be happy to concur with you.
[01:10:03.263 --> 01:10:06.625]  My calling is the religious aspect of the New World Order.
[01:10:07.406 --> 01:10:09.407]  My personal calling is in Acts 18.26 it is written,
[01:10:11.141 --> 01:10:13.863]  They explain the way of God to him more adequately.
[01:10:14.603 --> 01:10:19.406]  And if you look at this in context, it refers to Apollos, a learned man with a thorough knowledge of Scripture.
[01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:37.917]  My personal concern is that the vast majority of people that profess to be Christians have been told basically a half-truth, so that they don't know what it really means to be called to take up the cross.
[01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:43.844]  And I hope to send you a copy of my gospel presentation CD where it's really tough love.
[01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:50.790]  It gets into the things that usually get left out for fear of, you know, if you're going to scare somebody away with the truth, then they wouldn't have been saved anyway.
[01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:52.531]  That's basically my point of view.
[01:10:52.551 --> 01:11:04.621]  Well, I know the modern churches say everything's going to be fine, it's going to be a gravy train, submit to the government, never stand up against anybody, and the entire Bible is the complete opposite of that.
[01:11:05.377 --> 01:11:12.319]  And then there's these others that take the cost of discipleship and put a big minus sign on it with like the word faith movement thing.
[01:11:12.939 --> 01:11:14.920]  They're going to be crying peace and safety.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:16.601]  That's my real concern.
[01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:22.622]  Well, the New World Order has really taken over the churches in America, and you're absolutely right about that.
[01:11:22.682 --> 01:11:24.323]  Listen, send me some info, Mark.
[01:11:24.683 --> 01:11:26.263]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:27.104 --> 01:11:30.985]  I've got to hurry through these calls here so everybody gets a chance to get involved.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.524]  Yesterday I talked about half-truths.
[01:11:34.865 --> 01:11:38.071]  The fake Judas Goat conservatives.
[01:11:38.091 --> 01:11:40.937]  I mean, you don't think the globalists were going to take over without having frauds.
[01:11:40.957 --> 01:11:41.819]  They've got to have...
[01:11:42.566 --> 01:11:43.246]  We're good to go.
[01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:09.032]  Now, of course, it's not conservative at all, but people just don't care.
[01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:13.835]  They get caught up in labels, kind of a rah-rah like in sports or football or something.
[01:12:15.557 --> 01:12:20.901]  But I talked about half-truths just yesterday.
[01:12:24.304 --> 01:12:25.285]  I discussed how...
[01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:29.233]  These fake conservative talk show hosts will go, we've got to do something about immigration.
[01:12:29.273 --> 01:12:30.795]  The Mexican gangs are killing people.
[01:12:31.155 --> 01:12:32.736]  More cops have been killed.
[01:12:33.277 --> 01:12:36.280]  The border's shut down to tourism.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.361]  It's so dangerous.
[01:12:37.421 --> 01:12:41.585]  But the border's still wide open to the smugglers of humans and drugs.
[01:12:42.245 --> 01:12:44.808]  We've got to get behind President Bush's plan.
[01:12:45.854 --> 01:12:48.115]  The dumb Democrats, they're blocking it.
[01:12:48.315 --> 01:12:53.737]  But those talk show hosts know the Democrats wrote the amnesty plan that's now being repackaged.
[01:12:53.777 --> 01:12:55.678]  And Bush says, it's not amnesty.
[01:12:55.978 --> 01:12:57.039]  Well, it is amnesty.
[01:12:57.059 --> 01:12:58.259]  The biggest amnesty ever.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.862]  Amnesty for six and a half million plus people that they're saying will be eligible.
[01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:08.944]  And then for years and years, anybody who wants to come here will be legal.
[01:13:09.864 --> 01:13:13.426]  Instantly, when you touch the ground, when your plane lands...
[01:13:14.082 --> 01:13:22.489]  I mean, forget anchor babies where people come here and have babies so they can then get on five different types of welfare and have more kids and become legal themselves.
[01:13:22.969 --> 01:13:28.173]  This is where they can bring in skilled workers, unskilled workers at unlimited levels.
[01:13:28.213 --> 01:13:30.355]  You think the limited levels have been bad?
[01:13:30.415 --> 01:13:31.216]  Try unlimited.
[01:13:32.137 --> 01:13:34.318]  But people will debate with me who don't have the facts.
[01:13:34.378 --> 01:13:38.602]  I just heard the Sean Hannity's of the world tell them
[01:13:39.286 --> 01:13:47.029]  I mean, I've heard Sean Hannity actually say, we've got to do something about illegal immigration, we've got to stop the Democrats from blocking President Bush's plan.
[01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.290]  It's a Democratic plan!
[01:13:49.511 --> 01:13:50.931]  Hannity knows that!
[01:13:52.992 --> 01:13:54.793]  It's the same thing with vouchers.
[01:13:55.913 --> 01:13:59.875]  They come in and say, don't you deserve a choice in public schools?
[01:13:59.895 --> 01:14:01.256]  Especially in failed schools.
[01:14:01.316 --> 01:14:07.638]  Shouldn't these poor black kids be able, or poor white kids, or poor Hispanic kids, be able to go to a better public school with a school voucher?
[01:14:07.879 --> 01:14:08.679]  Or a private school?
[01:14:09.944 --> 01:14:11.005]  And yes, I'm for that.
[01:14:11.025 --> 01:14:15.429]  I think public schools are inherently state-controlled and bad, historically.
[01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:19.313]  I'm not knocking individual teachers and people that have held the system together despite that.
[01:14:20.014 --> 01:14:25.920]  But I'm against the federal government using our money to then take over all the private schools.
[01:14:26.974 --> 01:14:29.596]  Which is what vouchers are actually doing.
[01:14:30.156 --> 01:14:31.757]  Same thing with faith-based initiative.
[01:14:32.057 --> 01:14:33.538]  The government can't be involved in that.
[01:14:33.838 --> 01:14:34.999]  There's so many things.
[01:14:35.219 --> 01:14:43.024]  You hear this big push by fake conservative talk show hosts who've been well-paid in PR money and are out promoting their big books.
[01:14:43.805 --> 01:14:44.765]  You see it everywhere.
[01:14:47.667 --> 01:14:50.109]  The fair tax movement sounds good.
[01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:53.871]  The problem is they're going to give us a 23% sales tax tax
[01:14:56.067 --> 01:14:59.730]  And they're going to keep the income tax, and that's been the official plan for a decade.
[01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:19.947]  They're going to cut the income tax, rename it, change that basic tax system, so you'll have a flat tax of 10%, and then they'll jack that up, and a starting sales tax of 23%, that will then bring federal control into every single terminal, every single cash register, every single shopping cart.
[01:15:20.387 --> 01:15:24.971]  And it's a globalist plan, and I've seen their think tanks pushing it since I learned of it a decade ago.
[01:15:25.934 --> 01:15:30.795]  And now it's starting to come to fruition and Bush is mentioning it and saying it'd be a good idea.
[01:15:31.515 --> 01:15:33.875]  Oh, if Bush is saying it, do you think it's a good idea?
[01:15:34.295 --> 01:15:35.456]  Come on, boys and girls.
[01:15:36.876 --> 01:15:38.476]  But again, it's half-truths.
[01:15:38.596 --> 01:15:43.837]  Half-truths sound good, they taste good, they feel good, but they're poison.
[01:15:45.297 --> 01:15:50.578]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in California.
[01:15:50.598 --> 01:15:51.398]  Chris, thanks for holding.
[01:15:52.198 --> 01:15:52.579]  Hi, Al.
[01:15:53.099 --> 01:15:53.319]  Hi.
[01:15:53.839 --> 01:15:55.119]  Hi, I'm in Sacramento.
[01:15:55.965 --> 01:15:58.286]  A few blocks, actually, from the Capitol.
[01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:00.507]  You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:16:01.128 --> 01:16:05.450]  But I wanted to talk about, you had that guy from the CIA on last week or so.
[01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:11.053]  And I wanted to, I saw this show on 60 Minutes.
[01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:18.297]  And they were doing a story about how someone could infiltrate chemical plants.
[01:16:19.437 --> 01:16:22.499]  And what they said at the end, they had a CFR guy come on there.
[01:16:23.516 --> 01:16:28.218]  And he said, what we need is someone who can head up, you know, all the intelligence agencies.
[01:16:28.858 --> 01:16:33.940]  And then this John Negroponte guy all of a sudden is like the director of all 15 agencies.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:39.042]  Who ran the death squads in Latin America and set up the death squads in Iraq.
[01:16:39.422 --> 01:16:40.943]  And his name, of course, means death.
[01:16:41.683 --> 01:16:45.644]  And we are just in a lot of trouble having people like him running things.
[01:16:46.084 --> 01:16:52.607]  Yeah, and I wanted to, you know, the next time you have a CIA person on there or something, you know, one of these intelligence people say, you know, what do you think this...
[01:16:53.191 --> 01:16:54.452]  Why is this guy in charge?
[01:16:54.632 --> 01:16:59.797]  Armitage, all of them, are really scary, scary, scary people.
[01:17:00.898 --> 01:17:12.287]  Yeah, and also I saw in one of your articles about the CFR, where it said... Hold on a second.
[01:17:14.929 --> 01:17:16.751]  Well, while you're finding it, let me just say this.
[01:17:17.751 --> 01:17:21.914]  You know, we always talk about how the CFR quote runs things, and the media makes jokes out of it.
[01:17:22.494 --> 01:17:26.197]  Five years ago, you never saw people say they were CFR on television.
[01:17:26.217 --> 01:17:33.081]  They just were CFR, and we all carry little maps with us with all their names, and we can open the chart up and go, yep, he's CFR.
[01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:42.907]  I mean, have you heard somebody on the nightly news go, world government's what we need, or gun control's what we need, or getting rid of our borders is what we need, or more cameras is what we need.
[01:17:43.107 --> 01:17:45.269]  Every time, it's CFR.
[01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:53.232]  And even their public book that they put out every two months called Foreign Affairs is World Government's Good, Getting Rid of Our Borders is Good.
[01:17:53.832 --> 01:17:56.493]  I mean, there's no conspiracy theory about it.
[01:17:56.533 --> 01:17:58.134]  These guys are letting it all hang out.
[01:17:58.314 --> 01:17:58.914]  But go ahead.
[01:17:59.734 --> 01:18:06.936]  Yeah, there was something about on the Charlie Rose Show, and that's a total forum for CFR people.
[01:18:06.976 --> 01:18:08.017]  He always has people on there.
[01:18:08.037 --> 01:18:11.718]  And Jim Lehrer reports he always has CFR people on there.
[01:18:12.418 --> 01:18:12.498]  And...
[01:18:14.116 --> 01:18:22.279]  On the Charlie Rose Show, it said something in your article about where the new head of the CFR was like, well, now we can put people in.
[01:18:22.299 --> 01:18:23.939]  You know, the New World Order is now.
[01:18:24.379 --> 01:18:25.780]  We can put our people in there.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.061]  And it's like all these people, Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, they're all members.
[01:18:32.522 --> 01:18:35.963]  I know, 2,600 people, and they're just the foot soldiers.
[01:18:36.661 --> 01:18:38.724]  And you've got Trilateral, which is a couple hundred.
[01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:42.888]  They're all the chief economists of the world, heads of banks, major banks.
[01:18:43.069 --> 01:18:45.431]  And then you've got the Bilderberg Group, a hundred people.
[01:18:46.473 --> 01:18:49.656]  And the politicians actually come in and kneel before them.
[01:18:50.157 --> 01:18:50.818]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.224 --> 01:18:58.307]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.
[01:18:58.587 --> 01:19:06.353]  rxdrugcard.com is a simple, innovative program designed to give individuals the same purchasing power as large HMOs and insurance companies.
[01:19:06.573 --> 01:19:16.441]  As a member of rxdrugcard.com, you'll enjoy savings of up to 80% on all prescription medications at over 52,000 USA pharmacies, including Walmart, Walgreens, and Eckerd's.
[01:19:16.721 --> 01:19:17.382]  We're good to go.
[01:19:38.581 --> 01:19:39.982]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:19:40.002 --> 01:19:40.622]  One and the same.
[01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:13.433]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.853 --> 01:20:16.975]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:17.235 --> 01:20:19.075]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:19.135 --> 01:20:22.156]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:22.696 --> 01:20:24.937]  Here is reality.
[01:20:25.277 --> 01:20:28.859]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:29.359 --> 01:20:32.980]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:37.313]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:20:37.773 --> 01:20:41.475]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:20:54.068 --> 01:20:55.689]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:59.932]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:21:00.052 --> 01:21:02.933]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:21:03.013 --> 01:21:09.738]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:21:09.918 --> 01:21:12.919]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.501]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:15.641 --> 01:21:20.364]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:21:20.544 --> 01:21:35.111]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:21:35.271 --> 01:21:41.954]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Blank Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:21:44.855 --> 01:21:44.975]  803-4438.
[01:21:45.015 --> 01:21:45.336]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:54.036 --> 01:22:00.923]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:22:01.063 --> 01:22:13.996]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Stobie, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:22:14.176 --> 01:22:15.958]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:22:16.118 --> 01:22:16.498]  We're good to go.
[01:22:35.339 --> 01:22:36.039]  We're good to go.
[01:23:02.859 --> 01:23:04.360]  NSA whistleblower coming up.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.480]  Let's hurry through the calls.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.421]  David in Montana, you're on the air.
[01:23:07.461 --> 01:23:07.842]  Welcome.
[01:23:08.982 --> 01:23:10.143]  Welcome to Montana.
[01:23:10.203 --> 01:23:11.984]  It's great to hear you up here, Alex.
[01:23:12.064 --> 01:23:14.005]  It's about time we got you up here.
[01:23:14.165 --> 01:23:19.287]  I want to say that terrorism is being used as a cattle prod to corral nations.
[01:23:19.888 --> 01:23:26.811]  If you look what happened to Poland after World War II, the way Russia took over Poland, they said there was terrorists there, they had to take it over.
[01:23:27.391 --> 01:23:31.513]  Ivan the Terrible regained his power through the Black Riders.
[01:23:31.774 --> 01:23:32.374]  Same thing.
[01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:37.006]  And Iran will be invaded because it's the only peace.
[01:23:37.856 --> 01:23:42.800]  Of the puzzle left to be placed in the reopening of the old Silk Trail.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:47.924]  You can't run a global government without that old Silk Trail being opened up again.
[01:23:48.124 --> 01:23:49.565]  Well, you know what you're talking about.
[01:23:49.605 --> 01:23:57.171]  That's what Brzezinski, the National Security Advisor, said, is that they've got to get Iraq, Afghanistan, and then Iran.
[01:23:57.512 --> 01:24:04.377]  If you look, those three countries border each other, and there's also trillions and trillions of dollars of oil in each country.
[01:24:05.037 --> 01:24:07.539]  Only three empires was able to keep that open.
[01:24:07.559 --> 01:24:12.483]  Alexander the Great, the Romans, and then really those were the only two that really kept it open.
[01:24:12.503 --> 01:24:13.523]  The rest of the time, the
[01:24:34.454 --> 01:24:35.174]  We're good to go.
[01:24:35.214 --> 01:24:35.555]  I think?
[01:24:55.473 --> 01:24:59.977]  And just don't participate, because the only way it could exist is participation.
[01:25:00.298 --> 01:25:00.958]  No, I hear you.
[01:25:00.978 --> 01:25:03.941]  What station are you listening to us there in Big Sky Country?
[01:25:04.161 --> 01:25:05.883]  KGEZ 600.
[01:25:05.923 --> 01:25:08.846]  We just picked you up yesterday, and it's so good, the area, man.
[01:25:08.946 --> 01:25:09.626]  It's really good.
[01:25:09.747 --> 01:25:14.851]  Well, tell that new affiliate that we're very thankful, and I'm also cutting some promos for them.
[01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:17.994]  They should be getting soon a lot of new stations coming on board.
[01:25:18.054 --> 01:25:18.435]  But listen.
[01:25:18.995 --> 01:25:24.999]  It might have been radical to put us on 5, 10 years ago, but frankly now, everything we talk about is mainstream.
[01:25:25.059 --> 01:25:30.123]  It's just that we still put it all together for people in one place.
[01:25:30.743 --> 01:25:35.387]  And so it is exciting to have all these new stations turning us on, and I really appreciate your call, David.
[01:25:35.407 --> 01:25:35.987]  Anything else?
[01:25:37.108 --> 01:25:42.551]  Just power to the people, and just don't participate.
[01:25:42.591 --> 01:25:46.154]  And if you do participate, add the American twist to it.
[01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:48.871]  Because we're up to our necks in this globalism.
[01:25:48.891 --> 01:25:50.372]  We really can't do nothing about it.
[01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:51.633]  We've got to hit it head on.
[01:25:51.653 --> 01:25:52.893]  I agree.
[01:25:53.293 --> 01:25:53.934]  Listen, I agree.
[01:25:53.994 --> 01:25:57.015]  It's time to stop playing games and to stop mincing words.
[01:25:57.075 --> 01:26:03.438]  I appreciate the things you said because David knows what he's talking about.
[01:26:03.498 --> 01:26:09.802]  But unfortunately, for so many Americans who, again, aren't stupid, they're just distracted.
[01:26:09.882 --> 01:26:14.524]  They're experts on fashion or sports.
[01:26:15.442 --> 01:26:23.064]  Or on their sports cars, their experts on basically culinary things, eating.
[01:26:23.904 --> 01:26:26.985]  But they're not experts on their form of government or on history.
[01:26:27.305 --> 01:26:30.626]  And frankly, folks, history is amazingly entertaining.
[01:26:31.366 --> 01:26:33.687]  It's exhilarating, it's scary, it's exciting.
[01:26:34.067 --> 01:26:36.508]  And then once you know history, you're not doomed to repeat it.
[01:26:37.328 --> 01:26:40.589]  And so I wish the average American was informed like David.
[01:26:41.589 --> 01:26:42.529]  And think about Iran.
[01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:44.350]  What has Iran done to us?
[01:26:45.146 --> 01:26:46.387]  I mean, I don't want to live over there.
[01:26:46.427 --> 01:26:48.047]  I don't particularly like their government.
[01:26:48.768 --> 01:26:51.989]  But it's nothing compared to North Korea, nothing compared to China.
[01:26:52.569 --> 01:26:56.691]  They're not mowing down whole villages in Iran right now like they are in China.
[01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:59.292]  They're a lot more free in Iran than they are in China.
[01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:00.433]  Why?
[01:27:00.513 --> 01:27:00.753]  Why?
[01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:02.273]  Because they won't play ball.
[01:27:03.014 --> 01:27:08.836]  And our own government admittedly carried out terror attacks there to cause what we now see today.
[01:27:08.876 --> 01:27:12.698]  Did you know that our government carried out attacks and blame it on innocent people?
[01:27:14.105 --> 01:27:16.627]  On Mosedec, and now we have the mess we have today.
[01:27:17.647 --> 01:27:20.129]  Let's go ahead and talk to Hartwell in Louisiana.
[01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.929]  Hartwell, go ahead.
[01:27:21.389 --> 01:27:24.211]  Yes, I have two questions on the Twin Towers.
[01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:29.874]  The first one is, what method was used to detonate the charges in the buildings?
[01:27:30.234 --> 01:27:33.396]  Was it a radio frequency or were they wired?
[01:27:34.597 --> 01:27:38.799]  Well, sir, you know, this is the problem with a question like that.
[01:27:38.839 --> 01:27:39.840]  I think it's a good question.
[01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:42.336]  We know the official story isn't true.
[01:27:42.376 --> 01:27:44.457]  We know they told us that there was no prior knowledge.
[01:27:44.857 --> 01:27:47.338]  Now it's a fact that there was prior knowledge and they've lied about it.
[01:27:47.718 --> 01:27:49.419]  We know Bin Laden was CIA.
[01:27:49.439 --> 01:27:52.801]  We know the supposed hijackers were government agents trained at U.S.
[01:27:52.841 --> 01:27:54.841]  bases all over the country and being protected.
[01:27:55.262 --> 01:27:57.202]  We know public officials were told not to fly.
[01:27:57.243 --> 01:28:06.006]  We know from the seismographs, the eyewitnesses, the firefighters, the engineers, and the video of the bomb blast that there were controlled demolitions inside the building.
[01:28:06.407 --> 01:28:07.427]  Were they on timers?
[01:28:07.567 --> 01:28:08.588]  Were they remote controlled?
[01:28:08.768 --> 01:28:09.268]  I don't know!
[01:28:10.049 --> 01:28:12.936]  I mean, you know, I mean, look, here's the analogy.
[01:28:12.997 --> 01:28:19.573]  It's like the police catch a killer, and he's got a dead woman in his car with 20 knife wounds in her.
[01:28:20.248 --> 01:28:24.229]  And they even find a video of him kidnapping her, but not a video of him killing her.
[01:28:24.729 --> 01:28:25.649]  And he'll never talk.
[01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:28.150]  He'll never tell, you know, where did you stab her first?
[01:28:28.210 --> 01:28:30.610]  Well, you know, why'd you decide to stab her?
[01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:32.691]  We know the piece of trash stabbed her.
[01:28:32.991 --> 01:28:33.711]  We know he did it.
[01:28:33.751 --> 01:28:38.052]  We've caught him on 100 points, so there might be four or five points we can't figure out.
[01:28:38.412 --> 01:28:39.132]  C'est la vie.
[01:28:39.592 --> 01:28:42.713]  Got a guest coming up, but if you want to stay there, I'll answer your question more after she's gone.
[01:28:44.353 --> 01:28:45.254]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:47.254]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.243 --> 01:28:51.044]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:59.647]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:28:59.907 --> 01:29:03.508]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:29:03.648 --> 01:29:11.791]  These moving parts wear against each other and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:17.653]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:29:17.953 --> 01:29:23.216]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:29:23.457 --> 01:29:25.558]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:29:25.818 --> 01:29:37.966]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:29:38.186 --> 01:29:42.630]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:43.791]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:43.971 --> 01:29:45.593]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:47.514]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:29:47.775 --> 01:29:48.255]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:29:48.295 --> 01:29:48.475]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:29:55.310 --> 01:30:01.555]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:01.695 --> 01:30:07.859]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:08.139 --> 01:30:16.566]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:16.826 --> 01:30:23.831]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:28.954]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:34.578]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:34.918 --> 01:30:38.000]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:38.341 --> 01:30:46.246]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:46.346 --> 01:30:46.926]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.992 --> 01:30:55.573]  We're good to go.
[01:31:14.190 --> 01:31:19.995]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:31:20.296 --> 01:31:26.441]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:32.547]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:31:32.967 --> 01:31:34.148]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:31:34.468 --> 01:31:35.589]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:41.094]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[01:31:41.294 --> 01:31:44.756]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:31:45.037 --> 01:31:46.358]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:31:46.378 --> 01:31:46.658]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:32:03.427 --> 01:32:19.961]  Simbel Edmonds is our guest.
[01:32:20.422 --> 01:32:25.166]  And she was working with the FBI with all these NSA and CIA intercepts and wiretaps.
[01:32:26.087 --> 01:32:27.368]  And she was going back...
[01:32:28.135 --> 01:32:34.397]  Post 9-11 to pre-9-11 intercepts, and the story first broke when they were asking her to basically whitewash things.
[01:32:35.877 --> 01:32:43.240]  And then now to even try to tackle all the things that she's talked about, all the things that she has pointed people at, it just fits some of all the other intel I've had.
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:49.782]  You know, we've had FBI agents on, we've had David Shippers on representing Robert Wright, FBI, who was told he'd be arrested.
[01:32:50.322 --> 01:32:53.463]  He got up on C-SPAN and said, I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[01:32:54.281 --> 01:33:01.644]  And then Larry Klayman steps up and says, All I can tell you is the Bushes vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[01:33:03.005 --> 01:33:09.488]  And then, of course, what Sybil Edmonds will do is she'll say, Well, I can't really talk about the things I know.
[01:33:09.508 --> 01:33:10.509]  It was a threat with arrest.
[01:33:10.789 --> 01:33:13.070]  But now they've had to kind of back off because it's all public now.
[01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:17.032]  But it's kind of like Vietnam where the government was bringing in drugs.
[01:33:17.352 --> 01:33:19.032]  It's kind of like organized crime involved.
[01:33:19.052 --> 01:33:19.973]  You know, in this case...
[01:33:21.208 --> 01:33:28.010]  So we're going to be talking to her for 45 minutes, the balance of this hour and about 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:33.831]  But I want to start out with about a minute and a half clip of her with Daniel Ellsberg at the Pentagon Papers.
[01:33:34.711 --> 01:33:38.652]  The Village Boys shot some video of her just having lunch on the street there.
[01:33:39.332 --> 01:33:42.953]  And we'll go ahead and roll this little clip and then go right to Sabelle Edmonds.
[01:33:43.213 --> 01:33:43.673]  Stay with us.
[01:33:45.325 --> 01:33:54.674]  And I came to this point that I realized many people out there, either within the Congress or within the Commission, the attitude is they don't want to know the truth.
[01:33:54.734 --> 01:33:58.738]  It's like, see no evil, hear no evil, as long as we don't hear it or see it, we are saved.
[01:33:58.778 --> 01:34:01.200]  So I wanted to find out who wants to hear the truth.
[01:34:02.141 --> 01:34:05.044]  Because you're not talking about issues that have to do with
[01:34:07.122 --> 01:34:10.649]  Somebody was incompetent and they missed a single call.
[01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:18.385]  We are looking at much deeper issues that in certain cases things were prevented from being pursued.
[01:34:19.322 --> 01:34:41.737]  For example, I can't talk about the part that I know about, and that is the list of witnesses, special agents, okay, be it with the FBI or ATF and other translators who have come to us to meet, to family members, and their names and their contact information had been given to 9-11 Commission, and we can establish that these people were never contacted.
[01:34:42.297 --> 01:34:47.959]  And more people come forward, which we have been having people coming forward, not in the public, but to me.
[01:34:48.039 --> 01:34:49.780]  And they say, okay, I have information.
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:50.880]  Where do you take this people?
[01:34:50.941 --> 01:34:52.441]  You can't take them to 9-11 Commission.
[01:34:52.641 --> 01:34:53.842]  You can't take them to the Congress.
[01:34:53.862 --> 01:34:55.162]  They don't do anything.
[01:34:55.342 --> 01:34:57.503]  And you can't take them to Inspector General's office.
[01:34:57.543 --> 01:34:58.583]  They're not independent.
[01:34:58.684 --> 01:35:00.244]  And my report has been blocked for years.
[01:35:00.344 --> 01:35:02.125]  Where am I going to take these people?
[01:35:02.185 --> 01:35:04.786]  This is an issue that these people are really afraid of.
[01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:06.227]  They are being scared.
[01:35:06.547 --> 01:35:16.232]  I mean, look, if Ashraf is willing to go publicly gagging the Congress, publicly, imagine what he is doing that we are not hearing about.
[01:35:16.472 --> 01:35:20.895]  If publicly he is gagging the Congress, what is he doing behind closed doors for them?
[01:35:21.858 --> 01:35:23.018]  Let me tell you something.
[01:35:23.138 --> 01:35:29.160]  If she continues pressing us like this and plays pressure, she ain't going to make any friends here.
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:31.701]  She's not making anything but enemies.
[01:35:31.721 --> 01:35:32.901]  We don't like to be pressured.
[01:35:33.041 --> 01:35:41.603]  They know that for every piece that they will try to attempt to do with lies and tearing, I will put out one thing in there that's a concept for the rest of their lives.
[01:35:51.622 --> 01:35:53.004]  So have them be my guests.
[01:35:54.346 --> 01:35:55.167]  All right, folks.
[01:35:55.608 --> 01:35:57.531]  So there's that particular clip.
[01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:59.874]  And, of course, we're joined by Sabelle Edmonds.
[01:36:00.295 --> 01:36:02.098]  Sabelle, it's great to have you on with us.
[01:36:02.921 --> 01:36:04.062]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:36:04.162 --> 01:36:05.202]  Thank you for inviting me.
[01:36:05.742 --> 01:36:06.262]  You bet.
[01:36:06.543 --> 01:36:21.149]  You know, some people don't know who you are, but most of our listeners out there probably know that you're one of the better known or probably the best known whistleblower, but we never got to learn that much specifically from you because they threatened to clap you in irons if you didn't shut up.
[01:36:21.209 --> 01:36:28.412]  Then you went and tried to jump through hoops and tried to testify to the 9-11 Whitewash Commission and to the congressional folks as well.
[01:36:28.972 --> 01:36:30.633]  Nothing really ever came out of that.
[01:36:31.393 --> 01:36:33.713]  They never released any of that to speak of.
[01:36:33.733 --> 01:36:39.055]  I want you to go over that, but really I want to boil it down because you've talked about the organized crime.
[01:36:39.095 --> 01:36:45.596]  You discovered that you're not allowed to discuss, but now we see people going to jail for $800 million they stole.
[01:36:45.676 --> 01:36:48.377]  Congressman, I talked to you last week on the phone.
[01:36:48.437 --> 01:36:49.457]  It's now been in the Village Voice.
[01:36:49.497 --> 01:36:51.398]  It goes right up to Dennis Hastert.
[01:36:52.278 --> 01:37:07.445]  I mean, we're talking about just an incredible thing here, and I'd like you today, I know everybody says this, but I think this is a good place for you to do it, to go further than you ever had before, because I think, frankly, if we don't get it all out there on the table, we may end up in an actual dictatorship.
[01:37:07.885 --> 01:37:18.129]  More and more people I really respect, from Ron Paul to Paul Craig Roberts to Ray McGovern, are saying we may actually be in a dictatorship soon.
[01:37:18.469 --> 01:37:20.150]  So, Sabelle, thank you again for joining us.
[01:37:20.888 --> 01:37:22.049]  Thank you.
[01:37:22.209 --> 01:37:37.840]  Run through it for people, just the basics, who you are, as much as you can tell us about your particular case, and then if you can't specifically talk about things you discovered while going through these intercepts, give us examples that are already declassified, things that are comparable.
[01:37:39.384 --> 01:37:40.985]  Okay, that's the loaded question.
[01:37:41.005 --> 01:37:43.186]  You have put about 15 questions in one.
[01:37:43.206 --> 01:37:45.047]  I'm well known for that, yes.
[01:37:45.247 --> 01:37:48.129]  I'll start by telling a little bit about myself.
[01:37:48.249 --> 01:37:52.851]  Currently, I'm the founder and the president of National Security Whistleblowers Coalition.
[01:37:53.752 --> 01:38:02.957]  We are a non-profit organization, and our members are national security whistleblowers from the intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
[01:38:03.037 --> 01:38:07.119]  These agencies include FBI, NSA, CIA, DIA,
[01:38:08.976 --> 01:38:09.476]  Thank you.
[01:38:09.496 --> 01:38:10.317]  Thank you very much.
[01:38:32.366 --> 01:38:39.792]  Trying to point out to wrongdoings, government waste, fraud, abuse, or in some cases, criminal activities.
[01:38:40.453 --> 01:38:45.556]  And for doing the right thing, for doing this, they have been retaliated against.
[01:38:46.117 --> 01:38:50.260]  Like myself, many of them have been gagged or they have been fired.
[01:38:51.721 --> 01:38:53.883]  So this is what our organization does.
[01:38:54.323 --> 01:38:59.167]  We are trying, and I'm emphasizing the word trying because we haven't really succeeded yet.
[01:39:00.531 --> 01:39:04.634]  Without these people, we're going to end up with a dictatorship.
[01:39:04.934 --> 01:39:05.555]  Specifically... Correct.
[01:39:18.813 --> 01:39:19.214]  Exactly.
[01:39:19.234 --> 01:39:22.396]  Specifically, things are out of control.
[01:39:22.476 --> 01:39:33.863]  I mean, when an FBI agent gets up on C-SPAN and starts crying and says, I've been threatened with arrest if I tell you what I know, and then his lawyer steps up and says, all we can say is, the Bushes, vacation, with the Bin Ladens.
[01:39:34.184 --> 01:39:35.204]  I mean, that's an exact quote.
[01:39:35.224 --> 01:39:36.445]  We've got it somewhere on the computer.
[01:39:37.706 --> 01:39:40.748]  So, Mel, let's go back to your awakening.
[01:39:40.788 --> 01:39:45.351]  I mean, you were hired post-9-11 to go in, check all these interception things.
[01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:48.293]  I mean, when did you start to question, or what were you seeing?
[01:39:49.414 --> 01:39:54.019]  Actually, I started questioning and pointing out two serious cases.
[01:39:54.079 --> 01:40:00.625]  Some of them involved intentional blocking of intelligence translations.
[01:40:00.986 --> 01:40:12.377]  Some of them involved intentionally withholding certain investigations that were under counterintelligence from being transferred to counterterrorism because they should have been transferred.
[01:40:13.144 --> 01:40:19.527]  They have information that's related to the terrorist activities and other criminal activities.
[01:40:20.627 --> 01:40:28.710]  Some of the issues involved of certain security bridge acts occurring within the FBI.
[01:40:29.170 --> 01:40:40.575]  So I started reporting these cases together with documents and other witnesses in the department within two months after I started working for the Bureau around November, December 2001.
[01:40:42.248 --> 01:40:56.338]  And I want to emphasize internally, because a lot of people, they think whistleblowers are those who just see some wrongdoing, they jump on the street, and they start going... No, you are getting in trouble for even going to your superiors.
[01:40:56.758 --> 01:40:57.138]  Correct.
[01:40:57.579 --> 01:41:08.246]  I started with my superiors, then I went to their superiors, and in fact, I went all the way up the chain, all the way to Director Mueller himself within the FBI headquarters.
[01:41:10.263 --> 01:41:13.445]  And initially, they were asking me not to pursue this.
[01:41:14.306 --> 01:41:19.710]  And in return, they offered to give me a raise for my hourly rate.
[01:41:20.630 --> 01:41:21.731]  A payoff!
[01:41:22.532 --> 01:41:29.236]  They also sent me a commendation letter recommending for a special agent position, which I have with the FBI.
[01:41:29.497 --> 01:41:37.062]  And when I did not see continuing reporting these issues, in about February 2002...
[01:41:39.128 --> 01:41:39.829]  I think so.
[01:42:04.025 --> 01:42:04.365]  Thank you.
[01:42:04.385 --> 01:42:04.565]  Thank you.
[01:42:13.004 --> 01:42:15.305]  But they could have fined anything.
[01:42:15.665 --> 01:42:18.866]  We know now, though, they may have thought it was you when it was somebody else.
[01:42:18.906 --> 01:42:22.568]  We now know there were Army colonels that were talking to Congress.
[01:42:22.608 --> 01:42:28.470]  We now know there were a bunch of other people who were mad just like you were because they really wanted to stop terrorists.
[01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:36.593]  You see, Bush gets up there and says, I've got to spy on all of you and send the Army out to spy on peace groups and land rights groups.
[01:42:36.793 --> 01:42:38.593]  Folks, I've had the Army spy on me publicly.
[01:42:38.633 --> 01:42:39.794]  I mean, this is eight years ago.
[01:42:39.854 --> 01:42:41.414]  So this is widespread.
[01:42:41.434 --> 01:42:42.615]  This is institutionalized.
[01:42:43.075 --> 01:42:44.397]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:42:44.617 --> 01:42:57.330]  Really, the NSA was catching the chatter of impending terror attack, and Bush signed W1999, and he said to the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, you don't touch this or you're going to jail.
[01:42:57.711 --> 01:42:58.351]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:42:58.792 --> 01:42:59.052]  Right.
[01:42:59.713 --> 01:43:05.619]  So they didn't find anything, and two weeks later, they forced me to take a polygraph exam.
[01:43:06.739 --> 01:43:11.841]  And during the polygraph exam, they kept asking, have you taken these issues to the United States Congress?
[01:43:11.901 --> 01:43:13.922]  Have you discussed this outside the agency?
[01:43:14.062 --> 01:43:16.343]  Well, I passed the polygraph without a glitch.
[01:43:16.963 --> 01:43:18.584]  But that was the last straw for me.
[01:43:18.704 --> 01:43:20.945]  I decided, well, how?
[01:43:20.985 --> 01:43:26.367]  Meanwhile, there's headlines nationwide of government had prior knowledge.
[01:43:26.447 --> 01:43:30.988]  NSA knew, but Bush and Condi were out jumping around saying, we never heard anything.
[01:43:31.209 --> 01:43:31.549]  Sorry.
[01:43:31.969 --> 01:43:32.269]  Correct.
[01:43:33.007 --> 01:43:34.668]  So that was a turning point for me.
[01:43:34.768 --> 01:43:47.333]  I decided, okay, this is the time to go to the Congress, to the appropriate committee, which is the Judiciary Committee with the Senate, because the Senate Judiciary Committee has the oversight of the FBI, Department of Justice.
[01:43:47.453 --> 01:43:49.133]  They've got total security clearances.
[01:43:49.153 --> 01:43:52.795]  They're already accusing you of something you haven't done, so you're going to try to up the ante.
[01:43:53.559 --> 01:43:58.104]  So I went to these people within the committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:43:58.264 --> 01:44:00.386]  I briefed their staff who had clearance.
[01:44:00.586 --> 01:44:03.509]  I went inside the secured facility and gave them documents.
[01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:10.376]  And about two weeks after that, I was terminated without any reason being cited.
[01:44:10.517 --> 01:44:14.661]  In fact, the letter I received from the Department of Justice said,
[01:44:15.069 --> 01:44:15.309]  Thank you.
[01:44:27.415 --> 01:44:36.921]  Now, Sabell Edmonds, this is a long story then of what happened, and certainly you've been winning this fight, but I specifically want to get into some articles I've read and some things I've heard you talk about on air.
[01:44:36.961 --> 01:44:43.265]  Let's get right into the nitty-gritty of this, because now the things you quietly talked about are now in the news.
[01:44:43.605 --> 01:44:50.269]  Congressmen stealing $800 million, fake defense contracting companies, Dennis Hastert connected into all of this.
[01:44:50.549 --> 01:44:57.312]  Because I remember you two years ago talking about, well, I can't tell you specifically what I saw, but it's like this case with government drug dealing.
[01:44:57.572 --> 01:45:05.755]  It's like this case with, well, it's like DynCorp coming out in Chicago Tribune kidnapping masses of children, white slavery.
[01:45:06.035 --> 01:45:14.459]  I mean, get into specifically some of the things that elements of this government are now doing and don't want us to know about.
[01:45:15.578 --> 01:45:20.681]  Well, bits and pieces of information, as you just pointed out, have been coming out.
[01:45:21.321 --> 01:45:24.522]  And this is from reporters, investigative reporters.
[01:45:24.983 --> 01:45:28.024]  Well, let's start with the recent Vanity Fair article.
[01:45:28.044 --> 01:45:31.145]  When I say recent, it came out in August 2005.
[01:45:31.806 --> 01:45:35.588]  And the Vanity Fair article, this was an article on my case and on me.
[01:45:36.288 --> 01:45:44.752]  And this article, based on the sources inside the Congress and inside the FBI, confirmed
[01:45:45.225 --> 01:46:01.928]  That Dennis Hassard was receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash, illegal cash, delivered to him for bribery purposes from certain foreign lobbying organizations, and they named at least two of those organizations.
[01:46:02.008 --> 01:46:06.389]  And again, their sources were congressional sources and sources within the FBI.
[01:46:06.489 --> 01:46:10.409]  Now, of course, we have the Duke out in California, $800 million in scams.
[01:46:10.509 --> 01:46:12.450]  I mean, he's already pled guilty to that.
[01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.250]  Correct.
[01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:17.667]  And the fact that they named some of these organizations.
[01:46:17.867 --> 01:46:23.012]  And Alex, people have been telling me, well, why don't you put some information out there?
[01:46:23.393 --> 01:46:27.377]  But they should ask themselves, what are they doing with the information that is already out there?
[01:46:28.076 --> 01:46:33.241]  That article came out and so far we have not had a single denial issued by the Department of Justice.
[01:46:33.261 --> 01:46:34.903]  Well, see, that's the thing about this now.
[01:46:35.003 --> 01:46:41.529]  People say, you know, Bush is now declaring he has the right to violate any law he wants and to spy on the American people.
[01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:45.113]  And the media focuses on little bitty teeny things like...
[01:46:45.513 --> 01:47:11.640]  foreign calls into the US when publicly it's going on domestically against political enemies declassified I mean why why are they going is Bush allowed to spy on his political enemies that's admitted he should be impeached and indicted right now for that but you're right Isabel that's totally ignored correct and not only with the media I think people should take the responsibility for this too the death of outrage by people
[01:47:12.136 --> 01:47:17.559]  So this Dennis Hastert story came out, 10-page article, with all these sources from the Congress.
[01:47:17.699 --> 01:47:18.279]  What happened?
[01:47:18.539 --> 01:47:18.939]  Nothing.
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:30.585]  Other articles have... Well, Cybele, you've also, I mean, just to digress, you've talked about, in the past, about how it's this shadowy mix of organized crime and government and contractors.
[01:47:30.645 --> 01:47:32.365]  I mean, I've heard you speak of that.
[01:47:32.385 --> 01:47:38.969]  Can you specifically, without getting into classified stuff you saw, kind of give us some other real-world examples?
[01:47:39.029 --> 01:47:39.769]  Because, go ahead.
[01:47:40.768 --> 01:47:41.088]  Correct.
[01:47:41.148 --> 01:47:44.329]  As I said, some pieces of information have come out in the press.
[01:47:44.389 --> 01:47:48.071]  The same media that you're saying is not putting this information out, it has come out.
[01:47:48.671 --> 01:48:03.997]  And one of the organizations, again, as I was talking about... Well, so by that, to clarify, it'll come out in one newspaper, but it won't get national traction where tonight on CNN, George Bush has the Pentagon watching local mothers' groups.
[01:48:04.437 --> 01:48:05.558]  Well, Alex, I disagree.
[01:48:05.598 --> 01:48:08.259]  I think it would if there was enough public pressure.
[01:48:08.855 --> 01:48:12.758]  Obviously, we don't have enough people putting the pressure on the media.
[01:48:13.198 --> 01:48:17.541]  After all, the media responds to this whole law of supply and demand, okay?
[01:48:18.061 --> 01:48:27.648]  And if there are, you know, there's public outrage out there, if there are, you know, hundreds of thousands, if not millions... Well, Sabella, I'm not trying to argue with you.
[01:48:27.668 --> 01:48:31.650]  I mean, I agree that we have power, but, I mean, take the Pentagon Papers.
[01:48:32.071 --> 01:48:33.452]  We've tried to get traction.
[01:48:33.492 --> 01:48:38.415]  The grassroots has had giant demonstrations, and I haven't seen one-tenth the coverage that should have gotten.
[01:48:39.736 --> 01:48:41.918]  The Downing Street memo.
[01:48:43.539 --> 01:48:43.859]  Right.
[01:48:44.119 --> 01:48:58.609]  But again, I'm saying if we don't have enough people, if you look at the recent polling and it says that 49% of people find nothing wrong with this illegal eavesdropping, that also answers that question.
[01:48:58.669 --> 01:49:04.153]  So you have those who don't respond, then you have 49% who don't care and they're saying this is just fine.
[01:49:04.433 --> 01:49:05.574]  Well, I don't believe that poll.
[01:49:05.634 --> 01:49:06.595]  I don't believe that poll.
[01:49:06.615 --> 01:49:08.156]  I've seen some other polls that contradict that.
[01:49:09.076 --> 01:49:13.559]  Well, again, that depends on who is doing the pollsters, who is in charge of the pollsters.
[01:49:13.599 --> 01:49:14.699]  That's correct.
[01:49:14.739 --> 01:49:15.300]  We've got a break.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:18.061]  When we come back, what are some of the other things you want to get into?
[01:49:18.101 --> 01:49:19.222]  Because this is very informative.
[01:49:21.103 --> 01:49:22.324]  This is extremely informative.
[01:49:22.344 --> 01:49:24.725]  What are some of the other things you want to talk about when we get back?
[01:49:25.266 --> 01:49:25.506]  Sure.
[01:49:26.616 --> 01:49:28.798]  I mean, I'm just curious from you, what are some of the other issues?
[01:49:28.818 --> 01:49:30.659]  Well, I'm here to answer your questions.
[01:49:30.739 --> 01:49:36.883]  I'm here to talk about several issues, from national security whistleblowers to the facts that are being covered up.
[01:49:36.983 --> 01:49:38.685]  And we'll cover them as you ask them.
[01:49:39.145 --> 01:49:39.445]  Great.
[01:49:39.545 --> 01:49:45.930]  I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say is, when we get back, we'll talk about what you think is most important.
[01:49:46.530 --> 01:49:47.111]  Stay with us.
[01:49:47.131 --> 01:49:48.832]  We'll be right back with Sabelle Edmonds.
[01:49:50.088 --> 01:49:55.592]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.772 --> 01:49:58.874]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.995 --> 01:50:02.897]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.957 --> 01:50:07.180]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:11.303]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.383 --> 01:50:13.285]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.445 --> 01:50:16.767]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.787 --> 01:50:17.888]  The medical bills...
[01:50:19.469 --> 01:50:21.490]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:24.692]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.872 --> 01:50:27.774]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.215 --> 01:50:34.339]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.879 --> 01:50:35.600]  We're good to go.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:36.080]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.414 --> 01:51:00.917]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.217 --> 01:51:12.121]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.381 --> 01:51:28.569]  yet require very little energy that's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive but it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries
[01:51:28.869 --> 01:51:29.369]  That's right.
[01:51:29.549 --> 01:51:36.653]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:36.953 --> 01:51:45.698]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.758 --> 01:51:46.398]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.242 --> 01:52:01.164]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.384 --> 01:52:03.645]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.845 --> 01:52:08.166]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500ppm, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:10.667 --> 01:52:10.988]  Thank you.
[01:52:30.811 --> 01:52:31.551]  We don't need no education.
[01:53:07.298 --> 01:53:17.284]  Many political pundits and experts have noted that Sabelle Edmonds' case is the most gagged case in U.S.
[01:53:17.324 --> 01:53:17.584]  history.
[01:53:17.624 --> 01:53:21.806]  It's gone up before the neocon Supreme Court that likes to appoint presidents.
[01:53:21.926 --> 01:53:23.287]  I'm not for the Democrats, folks.
[01:53:23.347 --> 01:53:25.929]  I'm just pointing out that we really do have an appointed president.
[01:53:26.924 --> 01:53:29.945]  And it's just really, really scary what's happening.
[01:53:29.965 --> 01:53:31.485]  So we'll go back to Sabelle in just a minute.
[01:53:31.766 --> 01:53:34.866]  She's going to be with us into the next hour, and there's a lot of other facets we're going to cover.
[01:53:35.347 --> 01:53:39.948]  And perhaps we'll even have time to open the phones up for a call or two, if it's specifically for our guests.
[01:53:39.968 --> 01:53:49.031]  But before we go back to Sabelle Evans and give you her website and other information, we want to know what really happened on 9-11, what the globalists are planning.
[01:53:49.051 --> 01:53:56.253]  If you want to understand state-sponsored terror and the type of criminals that are running our globe, you need to have my new film, Martial Law.
[01:53:57.142 --> 01:53:59.804]  Or another documentary I've just released, The Order of Death.
[01:53:59.924 --> 01:54:03.066]  Big discounts on them right now at Infowars.com.
[01:54:03.627 --> 01:54:05.448]  We've got a bunch of new specials there.

[01:54:12.453 --> 01:54:20.139]  There's also PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, my best audio interviews from the radio show, my weekly TV report.

[01:54:28.165 --> 01:54:32.707]  And when you get a yearly subscription, you get three months free, so PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:33.747 --> 01:54:36.469]  Sabelle, tell us about your own personal website.
[01:54:37.889 --> 01:54:38.110]  Sure.
[01:54:38.190 --> 01:54:39.550]  It is www.justacitizen.com.
[01:54:43.916 --> 01:54:49.058]  www.justacitizen.com That is a great domain.
[01:54:49.398 --> 01:54:56.460]  Now, we would think that you would have free speech, but why are you the most gagged individual in modern U.S.
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:56.820]  history?
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:59.301]  What are they so afraid of?
[01:54:59.621 --> 01:55:04.462]  I know you can't specifically talk about the gag, but what are some other things they've been afraid of in the past that have gone public?
[01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:05.730]  Right.
[01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:14.415]  As you know, the past Attorney General John Ashcroft, who happens to be a lobbyist today, he just started his lobbying firm in Washington, D.C.
[01:55:14.495 --> 01:55:15.676]  about six months ago.
[01:55:16.377 --> 01:55:21.460]  Actually, he's the only Attorney General in the United States history doing that, so that's just a sideline.
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:30.605]  Invoked this rarely invoked state secret privilege, gagging my case, and later he went and gagged the Congress, officially gagged the United States Congress,
[01:55:31.272 --> 01:55:32.872]  And two reasons he's cited.
[01:55:32.973 --> 01:55:38.934]  Reason number one, to protect certain diplomatic relations of the United States.
[01:55:39.254 --> 01:55:40.615]  By the way, I don't want to glaze over that.
[01:55:40.675 --> 01:55:51.878]  That is unprecedented to have the executive gag the legislative when the legislative, clearly even under a Federalist view, supersedes the executive in its powers.
[01:55:51.938 --> 01:55:52.218]  Go ahead.
[01:55:52.538 --> 01:55:53.638]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:55:53.738 --> 01:55:59.760]  And in fact, other organizations, even government agencies, came out and said that gag order on Congress was illegal.
[01:56:00.393 --> 01:56:05.657]  But our senators, our Republican senators... They're more than happy to follow it to set the precedent.
[01:56:05.937 --> 01:56:08.138]  They followed an illegal gab order.
[01:56:08.218 --> 01:56:12.762]  And this is Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy, Democrat and Republican.
[01:56:12.782 --> 01:56:14.583]  So this is what happened.
[01:56:14.983 --> 01:56:16.184]  And he cited two reasons.
[01:56:16.664 --> 01:56:16.904]  U.S.
[01:56:16.985 --> 01:56:20.267]  sensitive diplomatic relations and certain sensitive U.S.
[01:56:20.467 --> 01:56:21.828]  foreign business relations.
[01:56:22.512 --> 01:56:25.073]  Without indicating what those sensitive U.S.
[01:56:25.193 --> 01:56:26.954]  foreign business relationships were.
[01:56:27.715 --> 01:56:32.777]  And that goes to the heart of why I have been gagged and why this case has been gagged.
[01:56:32.817 --> 01:56:35.378]  And I'm going to quickly make an analogy here.
[01:56:35.938 --> 01:56:39.000]  Let's say you have this so-called war on drugs, okay, Alex?
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:49.405]  And you have this unwritten policy that says that you only go after the low-level, street-level drug dealers, and you will not touch the middlemen and those people on the top.
[01:56:50.091 --> 01:56:58.458]  Well, they have been following the similar unwritten rules with the investigations of this terror case, with the September 11 terror attack.
[01:56:59.038 --> 01:57:07.445]  And that is, intentionally, and I want to underline, intentionally, they are not going after the middlemen and the people on top.
[01:57:07.905 --> 01:57:11.228]  So to this day, the American public, they have not heard
[01:57:11.932 --> 01:57:24.338]  The real culprit behind 9-11, the money laundering and certain narcotic and illegal weapon procurements involved with some of these actors who happen to be the middlemen and the tough people.
[01:57:24.398 --> 01:57:25.678]  Stay there, Sabelle.
[01:57:25.718 --> 01:57:26.659]  Stay there, Sabelle.
[01:57:26.799 --> 01:57:28.339]  FBI, NSA, whistleblower.
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:30.821]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:30.881 --> 01:57:31.441]  Stay with us.
[01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:38.051]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.371 --> 01:57:39.211]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:39.251 --> 01:57:39.731]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.771 --> 01:57:40.772]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.812 --> 01:57:41.932]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:41.952 --> 01:57:47.073]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.588 --> 01:57:57.469]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.489 --> 01:58:01.752]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.333 --> 01:58:06.456]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.418 --> 01:58:12.801]  I really want to thank our courageous guest for her amazing courage.
[01:58:13.122 --> 01:58:19.107]  A wonderful lady, very intelligent and informed, and also not bad to look at.
[01:58:19.407 --> 01:58:22.710]  One of the guys that works here wanted me to say that to her.
[01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:25.252]  But just a great person, Sabelle Edmonds.
[01:58:26.094 --> 01:58:39.785]  And she, of course, worked for the FBI with these NSA and CIA intercepts, overseas intercepts, domestic intercepts, ran into just all sorts of horrible things, and tried to complain inside her agency.
[01:58:40.185 --> 01:58:42.567]  They raided her, tried to burn her, then she went to Congress.
[01:58:43.634 --> 01:58:46.977]  And many others have now gone public backing up what she has said.
[01:58:47.357 --> 01:58:48.758]  And her case has gone to the Supreme Court.
[01:58:48.778 --> 01:58:52.120]  If she says one thing they don't like, they'll try to clap her in irons.
[01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:53.221]  But let's see them try that.
[01:58:53.241 --> 01:58:55.462]  That will really turn the public against them.
[01:58:55.482 --> 01:58:56.923]  And the good news is people are waking up.
[01:58:58.244 --> 01:58:59.045]  So that is good news.
[01:58:59.065 --> 01:59:00.165]  Sabelle Edmonds is our guest.
[01:59:00.526 --> 01:59:02.027]  We're about to break here in just a few minutes again.
[01:59:02.267 --> 01:59:03.648]  But Sabelle, to continue...
[01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:07.970]  Now, why are you the most gagged in modern U.S.
[01:59:08.010 --> 01:59:08.311]  history?
[01:59:08.411 --> 01:59:11.712]  Why did the Supreme Court throw out your case, obviously, when it had merits?
[01:59:12.393 --> 01:59:13.513]  What are they so afraid of?
[01:59:13.573 --> 01:59:16.395]  And you go, well, government drug dealing.
[01:59:17.155 --> 01:59:18.516]  I mean, everybody knows that.
[01:59:18.576 --> 01:59:19.856]  I've had family that's seen it.
[01:59:19.876 --> 01:59:20.857]  I know people that have witnessed it.
[01:59:20.877 --> 01:59:24.879]  We've had so many DEA people on, and the head DEA agent for Latin America.
[01:59:25.299 --> 01:59:33.383]  I've interviewed CIA agents, Terry Reid, who were there unloading the cocaine, at Mena, Arkansas, with Bill Clinton driving up, getting his own personal supply.
[01:59:34.123 --> 01:59:37.566]  I mean, it's admitted with Oliver North, all of them.
[01:59:38.267 --> 01:59:39.508]  And so it's all public.
[01:59:40.128 --> 01:59:43.791]  And now I have congressional hearings with Cynthia McKinney and Rumsfeld.
[01:59:43.811 --> 01:59:49.336]  She goes, well, what about 200,000 women and little children being kidnapped by DynCorp and our government?
[01:59:49.656 --> 01:59:53.179]  And he goes, well, I don't deny it, and, you know, nothing's going to happen.
[01:59:53.879 --> 01:59:55.881]  So, I mean, really, a lot of this stuff's out in the open.
[01:59:55.901 --> 01:59:57.022]  But please continue, Sybil.
[01:59:57.642 --> 01:59:57.943]  Sure.
[01:59:58.043 --> 02:00:03.407]  It's one thing to point out that these things have macro-level government involvement, but that's
[02:00:03.962 --> 02:00:09.327]  That's overgeneralizing it, because you have elements... You mean criminal elements within certain compartments of government?
[02:00:09.847 --> 02:00:11.529]  Or people who work with government.
[02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:15.572]  Again, it's not right to just macro-level say it's government.
[02:00:15.612 --> 02:00:20.696]  Well, you know, George Norrie always corrects me when I say that, but I'm not going to let the government get around it.
[02:00:20.737 --> 02:00:27.682]  The point is the government's gotten rotten and corrupt, and it's pockmarked and full of worms, basically.
[02:00:29.264 --> 02:00:31.686]  Well, again, as I said, there are certain elements.
[02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:36.290]  And some of them are outside the government who work closely with the government.
[02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:37.891]  But regardless, they're being protected.
[02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:45.214]  Well, they are being protected because, as I said, these elements are involved with different branches of government.
[02:00:45.754 --> 02:00:56.620]  As these articles that have come out, that have pointed out, you know, you see certain links between organizations, lobbying organizations like APAC and American Turkish Council, ATC,
[02:00:57.959 --> 02:01:03.943]  And also American Turkish Associations with millions of dollars that they play with.
[02:01:04.403 --> 02:01:05.744]  Where does this money come from?
[02:01:05.924 --> 02:01:07.044]  Who does it go to?
[02:01:07.565 --> 02:01:11.367]  And to ask and pose the question that way.
[02:01:11.867 --> 02:01:25.054]  And to give a good example of this, for culprits who are involved in the cases that I am trying to bring to the public's attention, or I tried, and so far I have been gagged, a very good...
[02:01:26.329 --> 02:01:29.671]  Lobbying firm to look at is International Advisors, Inc.
[02:01:30.392 --> 02:01:33.874]  International Advisors, Inc.
[02:01:33.994 --> 02:01:37.156]  started in 1996-1995 by Richard Perle and Douglas White.
[02:01:37.776 --> 02:01:42.519]  They registered with the Department of State as agents of Turkey, okay?
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:49.404]  Although they were doing things for Pakistan and also for Saudi Arabia and to a certain degree for Israel,
[02:01:49.964 --> 02:01:59.147]  And International Advisors Inc., headed by Richard Perle and Douglas Bice, with no website, no services listed, have been playing with millions of dollars.
[02:01:59.527 --> 02:02:07.429]  And so these are architects of the Iraq invasion, meanwhile registered as agents of foreign governments, running around with bags of cash.
[02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:08.370]  Correct.
[02:02:08.610 --> 02:02:12.431]  And not only that, Alex, it's also the fact that
[02:02:13.024 --> 02:02:14.785]  You're saying it's a nexus.
[02:02:14.885 --> 02:02:15.286]  Absolutely.
[02:02:15.466 --> 02:02:16.627]  We'll stay there.
[02:02:16.647 --> 02:02:17.687]  We've got a break.
[02:02:17.728 --> 02:02:19.069]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:20.670]  Our final segment with Sybil Edmonds.
[02:02:20.690 --> 02:02:22.171]  So honored to have her with us.
[02:02:22.211 --> 02:02:24.112]  We'll have plenty of time for you to tell this.
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.143]  And just amazing information.
[02:02:35.223 --> 02:02:37.607]  It's just getting more and more key here.
[02:02:38.168 --> 02:02:38.830]  So stay with us.
[02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:44.440]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JusticeCitizen.com.
[02:02:47.239 --> 02:02:50.101]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.341 --> 02:02:51.042]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:51.142 --> 02:02:51.923]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.283 --> 02:02:56.946]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.

[02:03:47.924 --> 02:03:48.965]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:49.285 --> 02:03:52.068]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:52.348 --> 02:03:56.492]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.933 --> 02:03:57.754]  So what do you do?
[02:03:58.074 --> 02:04:02.658]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:03.139 --> 02:04:05.221]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:04:45.944 --> 02:04:54.468]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[02:04:54.688 --> 02:04:56.489]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:57.850]  That's one in four adults.
[02:04:58.223 --> 02:04:58.623]  We're good to go.

[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:53.063]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.683 --> 02:05:56.664]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:08.331 --> 02:06:10.332]  I'll tell you, I'm like an octopus or something.
[02:06:10.352 --> 02:06:20.257]  You ever seen those cartoons where the octopus is cutting somebody's hair with one tentacle and mowing the yard with the other and cooking dinner with another and smoking a cigar with the other?
[02:06:21.645 --> 02:06:22.825]  Doing accounting with the other?
[02:06:23.246 --> 02:06:28.827]  I was doing like three things during the break, and Terry Anderson calls in with his big national anti-immigration talk show.
[02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:29.608]  It's a pretty good show.
[02:06:30.168 --> 02:06:34.469]  And he's like wanting to get set up for this show, wanting me on his show, and I'm doing that coming into the break.
[02:06:34.509 --> 02:06:35.229]  It's just crazy.
[02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:38.310]  So sometimes we sound like we're flying around by the seat of our pants.
[02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:39.811]  It's because we are.
[02:06:39.891 --> 02:06:41.211]  But isn't that what you want?
[02:06:41.251 --> 02:06:43.372]  You don't want scripted, fake...
[02:06:43.872 --> 02:06:44.892]  We're good to go.
[02:06:44.912 --> 02:06:45.393]  We're good to go.
[02:07:08.712 --> 02:07:13.758]  They offered her payoffs, big agent certificates and jobs if she just shut up.
[02:07:14.218 --> 02:07:15.139]  And she just said no.
[02:07:15.199 --> 02:07:19.904]  I mean, she'd got all these intercepts of all this criminal activity that she's been gagged from talking about.
[02:07:19.924 --> 02:07:23.068]  So we're just talking about other examples of it.
[02:07:23.128 --> 02:07:26.011]  Weapons dealers, narcotics dealers, white slavery.
[02:07:26.031 --> 02:07:27.052]  That's all public now.
[02:07:27.152 --> 02:07:29.455]  We can talk about those instances.
[02:07:30.075 --> 02:07:31.537]  And Sabell can discuss them.
[02:07:31.797 --> 02:07:37.122]  Sabell, you've gotten into Dennis Hastert and how it's in Vanity Fair with the reports of him and all these payoffs.
[02:07:37.162 --> 02:07:42.887]  We have different congressmen going to jail now for stealing $800 million plus.
[02:07:43.788 --> 02:07:49.794]  They're admitting mainstream news that it affects a bunch of senators, a bunch of congressmen, but somehow none of them are now getting in trouble.
[02:07:50.686 --> 02:08:04.737]  Is this good news to you, though, that at least some people are getting in trouble and it looks like their wall of corruption, the scales on the belly of the dragon, may have some soft spots, Sybil?
[02:08:05.318 --> 02:08:06.899]  I would say let's wait and see.
[02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:14.024]  I'm still curious to see how this is going to end and what kind of accountability we are going to see at the end of the story.
[02:08:14.044 --> 02:08:15.566]  So the story hasn't ended yet.
[02:08:16.466 --> 02:08:19.769]  And as you know, this is only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:26.976]  And people should be looking at, and also you're looking, when you come to Washington, D.C., you're looking at all the revolving doors.
[02:08:27.556 --> 02:08:31.199]  Even when they are disgraced, even when they get out, they don't really get out.
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:35.363]  I'm going to give you one good example that people need to look into.
[02:08:35.803 --> 02:08:43.770]  And again, the same company that is involved among the companies that I just named, and that is Livingston Group.
[02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:48.173]  Livingston, Bob Livingston used to be the Speaker of the House, and he was disgraced.
[02:08:48.193 --> 02:08:48.694]  He got out.
[02:08:49.255 --> 02:08:56.821]  And now he has this large lobbying firm, and I would invite your listeners to go to his website and see his top clients.
[02:08:56.981 --> 02:08:57.702]  He's charging $1,200,000.
[02:08:58.582 --> 02:09:00.664]  He's charging Turkey.
[02:09:01.225 --> 02:09:04.787]  And this is not the government of the Turkish Republic.
[02:09:04.847 --> 02:09:06.669]  This is who are these people.
[02:09:13.662 --> 02:09:27.284]  Yes, and for stations that didn't carry the last segment, you went through some other examples of Richard Perle and other architects of the war who worked in the Pentagon simultaneously being registered agents of foreign governments.
[02:09:27.344 --> 02:09:30.485]  Now, I mean, that's openly illegal on its face.
[02:09:30.525 --> 02:09:36.586]  You can't be a registered agent of a foreign government and then have a high-level administration position.
[02:09:37.086 --> 02:09:38.287]  Alex, are you telling me?
[02:09:38.347 --> 02:09:49.311]  In fact, the complaints were filed by Pentagon, by the Department of Defense in 1998 by several organizations pointing out exactly what you just said.
[02:09:49.372 --> 02:09:50.292]  Guess what happened?
[02:09:50.808 --> 02:09:51.308]  Nothing.
[02:09:51.768 --> 02:09:53.029]  Oh, I bet they got fired.
[02:09:53.289 --> 02:09:53.809]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:54.209 --> 02:09:54.769]  You bet.
[02:09:55.569 --> 02:09:58.530]  You know, I mean, I want cops, you know, the average cop listening out there.
[02:09:58.790 --> 02:10:00.270]  This is publicly verifiable.
[02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:01.511]  The average judge listening.
[02:10:01.811 --> 02:10:04.191]  We have people openly engaging in crime.
[02:10:04.331 --> 02:10:04.491]  Right.
[02:10:04.511 --> 02:10:06.452]  I mean, we've got all these dual citizens.
[02:10:06.472 --> 02:10:07.412]  You talked about APAC.
[02:10:07.852 --> 02:10:15.454]  Admitted dual citizens who are riddling the administration, riddling the Congress, riddling top positions.
[02:10:16.212 --> 02:10:16.472]  Right.
[02:10:16.992 --> 02:10:17.792]  Absolutely right.
[02:10:17.892 --> 02:10:24.074]  And even those with only single citizenship, not with dual citizenship.
[02:10:24.094 --> 02:10:25.695]  That's for people who aren't even American citizens.
[02:10:25.715 --> 02:10:33.277]  Well, when it comes to money, you will see that a lot of loyalties will disappear, and the loyalty becomes the money and money.
[02:10:33.477 --> 02:10:34.637]  Well, here's another example.
[02:10:34.657 --> 02:10:44.260]  Right here in Texas, a large part of Rick Perry's administration, the governor, are actual registered Mexican citizen lobbyists.
[02:10:44.875 --> 02:10:49.718]  And he actually hires the lobbyists, and they actually run things at the Capitol.
[02:10:49.778 --> 02:10:50.778]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:10:50.818 --> 02:10:51.679]  It's mainstream news.
[02:10:52.599 --> 02:10:53.199]  I believe that.
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:56.581]  I mean, this is just... I mean, we're totally being taken over.
[02:10:56.601 --> 02:10:57.241]  Right.
[02:10:57.842 --> 02:10:58.202]  We are.
[02:10:58.242 --> 02:11:00.203]  I mean, it's just by Washington.
[02:11:00.263 --> 02:11:00.763]  It's cheap.
[02:11:00.823 --> 02:11:03.104]  So, here's an example, Sabelle.
[02:11:03.184 --> 02:11:06.746]  That's why our founders repeatedly said eternal vigilance.
[02:11:07.327 --> 02:11:12.469]  Because you can't say, well, we have separation of powers, we have our Constitution, we have our Bill of Rights.
[02:11:12.529 --> 02:11:13.890]  Is it going to take care of itself?
[02:11:14.338 --> 02:11:14.919]  We're good to go.
[02:11:14.939 --> 02:11:15.539]  We're good to go.
[02:11:36.434 --> 02:11:41.915]  And hopefully more and more people will get to listen and wake up and hear the wake-up bell.
[02:11:41.955 --> 02:11:44.536]  Well, it should scare everybody when a government goes bad.
[02:11:44.576 --> 02:11:45.996]  It's the most dangerous thing in history.
[02:11:46.056 --> 02:11:53.898]  And these evil people that are in the government are really trying to get total control and perfect a perfect despotism upon us.
[02:11:53.918 --> 02:11:55.338]  But I want to bring up another point to you.
[02:11:55.838 --> 02:11:59.239]  Did you see the Chicago Tribune two articles three weeks ago?
[02:11:59.259 --> 02:12:00.679]  Oh, yes, I did.
[02:12:01.636 --> 02:12:22.287]  Where the governor even had to come out and decry the Defense Department where admittedly Dyncor and Halliburton are running white slave rings all over Europe and in the Middle East from using men as slaves they grab out of villages just to build houses to small children they kidnap for other reasons.
[02:12:22.887 --> 02:12:29.391]  And it talked about how there are top lobbyists on the Hill openly lobbying the Congress for
[02:12:30.051 --> 02:12:33.314]  To not block the Pentagon from allowing this to go on.
[02:12:33.354 --> 02:12:35.436]  I mean, you talk about lobbyists for criminals.
[02:12:35.796 --> 02:12:41.421]  We have lobbyists openly lobbying for white slavery, and it's not Alex Jones or Sabelle Edmonds saying that.
[02:12:41.741 --> 02:12:44.783]  It's the Chicago Tribune and the governor of Illinois.
[02:12:45.384 --> 02:12:47.045]  Well, let's get that on Fox News.
[02:12:49.884 --> 02:12:54.586]  You will not see much reaction unless you get this into the mainstream media, Alex.
[02:12:54.726 --> 02:12:59.949]  But does that tie into any of the other areas that you were aware of?
[02:13:00.029 --> 02:13:00.849]  No, not at all.
[02:13:01.409 --> 02:13:03.170]  This is the first time I'm hearing about this.
[02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:05.331]  I need to go and check and look for accuracy.
[02:13:05.391 --> 02:13:06.532]  I don't know anything about that.
[02:13:07.413 --> 02:13:10.075]  Believe me, it was in the Chicago Tribune.
[02:13:10.095 --> 02:13:22.562]  Did you hear that out of the Chicago papers about John Yoo, one of the chief advisors to Bush, just like Gonzalez, our new attorney general, was, saying the president has authorized the torture of even people's children?
[02:13:22.582 --> 02:13:23.183]  Right, I read that.
[02:13:23.423 --> 02:13:23.643]  Right.
[02:13:24.203 --> 02:13:24.964]  So you did see that?
[02:13:25.224 --> 02:13:25.404]  Yeah.
[02:13:25.965 --> 02:13:34.490]  And then he got asked about it in Chicago in front of 2,000 students, and he said, yeah, the president has the power to do that to children and crush their body parts.
[02:13:35.509 --> 02:13:36.349]  Well, correct.
[02:13:36.389 --> 02:13:39.171]  These people, they don't believe in American democracy.
[02:13:39.271 --> 02:13:44.573]  In fact, they are saying Constitution is nothing but something that's, you know, inconveniencing us.
[02:13:44.593 --> 02:13:52.876]  So let's get rid of it and put it on a hanger, and let's use the fear factor and say, you know what, the terrorists are out there, they're trying to get us.
[02:13:53.296 --> 02:13:56.138]  And I point out to what the President said right after 9-11.
[02:13:56.858 --> 02:13:59.399]  He came out and he told the American public, he said...
[02:14:00.035 --> 02:14:03.316]  What they hate is the way of life we are leading here.
[02:14:03.656 --> 02:14:05.537]  They hate the way of our lives.
[02:14:05.557 --> 02:14:06.717]  He said they hate our freedom.
[02:14:06.737 --> 02:14:08.518]  Then why is Bush trying to kill our freedom?
[02:14:08.758 --> 02:14:10.279]  Because he is the terrorist.
[02:14:10.479 --> 02:14:14.980]  Well, for the past three years, it hasn't been the terrorists, but it has been this administration.
[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:15.520]  But it's true.
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:17.821]  When the government says the terrorists hate our freedom, it's true.
[02:14:17.921 --> 02:14:18.301]  It's true.
[02:14:18.761 --> 02:14:19.082]  It's true.
[02:14:19.122 --> 02:14:22.083]  The terrorists are the people running this government, and they do hate our freedom.
[02:14:22.103 --> 02:14:24.143]  So in a weird way, he's telling the truth.
[02:14:25.944 --> 02:14:26.164]  Right.
[02:14:26.724 --> 02:14:28.905]  People went out there and they voted.
[02:14:29.531 --> 02:14:33.012]  And that is unfortunate that this is what we are getting as a result of that.
[02:14:34.133 --> 02:14:37.134]  Well, I mean, Kerry's for invading Iran.
[02:14:37.294 --> 02:14:38.234]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:14:39.134 --> 02:14:40.735]  And again, people, they determine.
[02:14:40.815 --> 02:14:48.117]  I mean, where are the true leaders who really want to get up and say, you know, enough is enough and let's get our country back?
[02:14:48.578 --> 02:14:52.499]  Unfortunately, today, these elections and everything depend so much on money.
[02:14:53.038 --> 02:14:57.260]  Then the people that you get, your choice is Kerry or is Bush.
[02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:59.280]  And neither one of them would have my vote.
[02:14:59.481 --> 02:15:02.542]  We get the government we deserve, and we've disengaged from government.
[02:15:02.802 --> 02:15:04.242]  Things have gotten corrupt and decadent.
[02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:04.903]  They always do.
[02:15:04.963 --> 02:15:06.143]  Now we've got to re-engage.
[02:15:06.423 --> 02:15:07.944]  Sybil Evans, I totally agree with you.
[02:15:07.984 --> 02:15:10.445]  JusticeCitizen.com is the website.
[02:15:10.485 --> 02:15:11.645]  Links on InfoWars.com.
[02:15:11.765 --> 02:15:13.486]  I've got a few final questions for you.
[02:15:13.506 --> 02:15:16.327]  And again, I'm so honored that you've spent this much time with us already.
[02:15:16.747 --> 02:15:18.188]  Going back, just...
[02:15:18.888 --> 02:15:19.248]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:19.308 --> 02:15:19.468]  Well, uh...
[02:15:41.926 --> 02:15:45.429]  Alex, I mean, that will take an entire show to go through those.
[02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:56.139]  And if you go to our website, and that will be our organization's website, which is www.nswbc.org, we provide a lot of information about these cases.
[02:15:56.219 --> 02:16:04.346]  And unfortunately, the Congress has had this information, and they keep giving it to the Congress, and they are not doing anything.
[02:16:04.846 --> 02:16:08.910]  That's why, now that you pointed out to my website, justthecitizen.com,
[02:16:09.814 --> 02:16:16.941]  We just started a petition there asking for citizens to sign off saying that we demand open congressional hearings.
[02:16:17.081 --> 02:16:25.049]  And I'm emphasizing open because all the hearings on my case have taken place behind closed doors, under classified hearings.
[02:16:25.209 --> 02:16:27.512]  And then you tell them what you know.
[02:16:27.572 --> 02:16:29.033]  That then makes them accomplices.
[02:16:29.093 --> 02:16:30.915]  They promise to go public, but they never do.
[02:16:31.656 --> 02:16:34.942]  So that's why we need the citizens to come and sign these petitions.
[02:16:35.002 --> 02:16:37.526]  Currently, we have about 14,000 signatures.
[02:16:37.586 --> 02:16:39.410]  We won't be able to get anywhere with that.
[02:16:39.730 --> 02:16:41.854]  We need hundreds of thousands of signatures.
[02:16:42.287 --> 02:16:49.689]  So I encourage your listeners to go and sign on to this petition, which is on the website, www.justascitizen.com.
[02:16:49.989 --> 02:16:52.049]  Sabelle, we're almost out of time here.
[02:16:52.069 --> 02:16:56.310]  I know your case has been rejected by the Supreme Court.
[02:16:56.730 --> 02:16:59.611]  Should we be looking for any fireworks here in the future?
[02:16:59.631 --> 02:17:03.052]  Are you getting any intel that more scandals are about to break?
[02:17:03.852 --> 02:17:08.913]  Well, yeah, they never end, but that's the reason I want your listeners to sign this petition, because...
[02:17:09.574 --> 02:17:16.880]  You will hear much more when we start pursuing the Congress with these signatures and saying it's not one citizen or hundred citizens asking this.
[02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:20.883]  We are talking about hundreds of thousands, millions of people asking for this.
[02:17:21.324 --> 02:17:23.245]  And then hopefully we'll get the information out.
[02:17:23.525 --> 02:17:23.966]  All right.
[02:17:24.046 --> 02:17:26.227]  Well, Sabelle Edmonds, thank you again for joining us.
[02:17:26.288 --> 02:17:29.110]  And I hope to get you back up in the future as things develop.
[02:17:29.130 --> 02:17:29.690]  Godspeed.
[02:17:30.671 --> 02:17:35.315]  I've got some comments about all of this when we get back.
[02:17:36.218 --> 02:17:39.042]  Concerning Bill Clinton, Al Gore, how it ties into Bush.
[02:17:39.062 --> 02:17:40.784]  You'll want to stay with us for that.
[02:17:40.905 --> 02:17:44.490]  And then we're going to take your calls and cover the Iran situation after that.
[02:17:47.111 --> 02:17:50.412]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:17:50.752 --> 02:17:56.034]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:17:56.294 --> 02:17:58.174]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.
[02:17:58.494 --> 02:18:03.035]  Vitamir has created unique and natural patented formulas that set them apart from any other oral hygiene products.
[02:18:03.215 --> 02:18:08.517]  The folks at Vitamir have blended zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and clove oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath
[02:18:08.697 --> 02:18:09.637]  And fight gum disease.

[02:18:11.018 --> 02:18:20.201]  And regular use of Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash is a powerful frontline defense against gingivitis, bleeding gums, and folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just-from-the-dentist-office feeling.
[02:18:20.421 --> 02:18:23.782]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.
[02:18:24.022 --> 02:18:25.182]  Call 877-817-9829.

[02:18:57.306 --> 02:18:58.747]  It includes a history of U.S.
[02:18:58.847 --> 02:18:59.248]  coins.
[02:18:59.958 --> 02:19:00.618]  We're good to go.

[02:19:45.908 --> 02:19:47.490]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:53.615]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:19:53.875 --> 02:19:59.000]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:08.629]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:20:08.969 --> 02:20:13.911]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:20:14.251 --> 02:20:18.252]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:20:18.472 --> 02:20:23.234]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:20:23.594 --> 02:20:29.476]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:20:37.221 --> 02:20:38.361]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:47.381 --> 02:20:49.964]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:20:50.104 --> 02:20:52.266]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:20:52.546 --> 02:21:02.635]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:21:02.956 --> 02:21:05.298]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[02:21:05.478 --> 02:21:09.542]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[02:21:09.762 --> 02:21:10.383]  We're good to go.
[02:21:29.395 --> 02:21:33.039]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[02:21:33.239 --> 02:21:35.762]  Call today for a Calbin Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:21:35.802 --> 02:21:37.464]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calbinpuresoap.com.
[02:21:49.051 --> 02:21:49.531]  Don't worry.
[02:21:50.011 --> 02:21:51.551]  This show is documented.
[02:21:52.052 --> 02:21:54.772]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.212 --> 02:21:58.753]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:21:59.173 --> 02:22:01.393]  I went down, down, down.
[02:22:01.573 --> 02:22:06.594]  George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, George Jr., they're all in business together.
[02:22:07.074 --> 02:22:08.694]  At that level, it's totally staged.
[02:22:08.715 --> 02:22:16.636]  They all take vacations together and hang out, and the Bush family calls Bill Clinton their surrogate son, and he calls Barbara his mother.
[02:22:17.396 --> 02:22:28.499]  When he goes back to Mena, Clinton was a known intelligence officer and was running the drugs in and out of there for the crime families, going back from even the time before he became governor.
[02:22:29.479 --> 02:22:30.379]  He was involved in it.
[02:22:31.879 --> 02:22:40.361]  And so, right at the key point where there's this big police state and the NSA and the rest of this, Al Gore comes out and says, you're destroying the Constitution.
[02:22:40.662 --> 02:22:42.902]  You're setting up a despotic dictatorship.
[02:22:43.662 --> 02:22:45.423]  Well, see, if Bush's approval rating is down at 35%,
[02:22:47.330 --> 02:23:00.802]  Actually having a Democrat attack him will polarize, and a lot of Republicans that were starting to wake up, I mean a lot of Republicans are against Bush when he's at 35%, suddenly you see his numbers start going back up to 40, 45%.
[02:23:01.622 --> 02:23:09.149]  Because everybody knows Al Gore is bad news, so if Al Gore is coming out and attacking, then see, George Bush must be good.
[02:23:10.083 --> 02:23:13.346]  And all of this is just a legitimizing of the spying.
[02:23:13.366 --> 02:23:15.768]  Because you notice they talk about the least thing.
[02:23:15.928 --> 02:23:17.610]  Oh, some foreign phone calls to the U.S.
[02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:27.298]  Now, it's in the back of the newspaper that the NSA is watching the mothers that complain about recruiters at the high school and the Army sends out regular Army to spy on citizens.
[02:23:27.358 --> 02:23:30.161]  And all of this is going on nationwide for decades.
[02:23:32.002 --> 02:23:35.045]  So they tell you about the least thing that sounds legitimate.
[02:23:36.289 --> 02:23:37.750]  To condition you to accept it.
[02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:45.112]  And then the so-called conservatives, or really fake conservatives, can go, look, Al Gore's a hypocrite, so that makes it okay that Bush is doing it.
[02:23:47.473 --> 02:23:51.574]  So now they can defend the spying as if it's somehow conservative.
[02:23:52.614 --> 02:23:57.056]  And again, they'll have the Democrats come out and say, we're against the national ID card, how dare you, Bush?
[02:23:57.536 --> 02:23:59.436]  And then outvote Republicans in the Senate.
[02:24:00.897 --> 02:24:00.937]  Or...
[02:24:02.182 --> 02:24:07.126]  93 to, what, five and a few abstentions, people that didn't vote.
[02:24:08.147 --> 02:24:11.950]  Over and over again, they'll have a big chicken fight.
[02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:13.391]  Feathers flying.
[02:24:13.792 --> 02:24:17.175]  But I'm telling you, folks, it is a big joke at the end of the day.
[02:24:18.624 --> 02:24:19.825]  It's good cop, bad cop.
[02:24:20.206 --> 02:24:32.196]  For people who don't believe that slick politicians that have climbed their ways up to committee chairmanships don't engage in theater, low-level cops, when they pull somebody over and want to play good cop, bad cop, they engage in theater.
[02:24:32.677 --> 02:24:33.638]  This is what people do.
[02:24:34.711 --> 02:24:51.996]  And I've had so many politicians in the chair, in the studio, or I've talked to so many over the phone line and so many in the TV station studio, I mean, they've admitted, yes, most of it is pre-decided beforehand, but a politician has got constituents that he's got to act like he's doing something for.
[02:24:53.346 --> 02:25:00.950]  And until we realize that and stop loving the Democrats, stop loving the Republicans, listen, I'm able to deprogram liberals.
[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:10.274]  I'm able to convince them that government education is bad, that gun control is bad, that open borders are bad, because I use the real issues, not the political football issues.
[02:25:10.794 --> 02:25:19.498]  And I've got, you know, the city of Austin, literally thousands and thousands of liberals that I've met have gone out and bought guns, deprogrammed themselves, because...
[02:25:22.495 --> 02:25:23.536]  I'm not a hypocrite.
[02:25:23.696 --> 02:25:34.724]  Well, they listened to one word I had to say if I was defending Bob Dole back in the mid-90s or if I was defending George Bush today while I was attacking Democrats.
[02:25:34.884 --> 02:25:37.686]  No, I will equally attack them when they're in the wrong.
[02:25:38.147 --> 02:25:40.208]  And I will praise them when they're in the right.
[02:25:40.689 --> 02:25:41.889]  Like the governor of Illinois.
[02:25:41.949 --> 02:25:45.532]  Bad on guns, good on exposing the government kidnapping rings.
[02:25:46.873 --> 02:25:50.656]  So, for people, I know a lot of news stations are joining us on a daily basis.
[02:25:51.852 --> 02:25:55.253]  I'm just trying to get new listeners to understand my philosophy.
[02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:56.574]  It's a populist view.
[02:25:56.894 --> 02:25:58.734]  It's a constitutionalist view.
[02:25:59.295 --> 02:26:03.136]  I look at an issue and I say, does that give me more liberty or less liberty?
[02:26:03.896 --> 02:26:05.857]  Does that centralize power more?
[02:26:06.217 --> 02:26:08.518]  Is that being lobbied for by corrupt interests?
[02:26:08.578 --> 02:26:09.718]  And then I'm against it.
[02:26:10.572 --> 02:26:14.195]  Like all these liberals hate George Bush, but they love him with open borders.
[02:26:14.456 --> 02:26:16.577]  They love the fact he loves La Reconquista.
[02:26:16.838 --> 02:26:23.624]  Well, I ask the La Raza, La Reconquista, Takeover America's Southwest crowd, do you really think you're fighting Whitey?
[02:26:24.044 --> 02:26:25.845]  Do you really think you're fighting the New World Order?
[02:26:25.865 --> 02:26:28.868]  Do you really think you're fighting something when it's all financed out of D.C.
[02:26:28.888 --> 02:26:29.389]  and New York?
[02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:33.752]  No, these criminals in government want to loot America.
[02:26:34.073 --> 02:26:36.555]  And anything that gets us fighting with each other, they love.
[02:26:38.061 --> 02:26:40.543]  I mean, let's say you're already an illegal alien who's gotten to the U.S.
[02:26:40.623 --> 02:26:41.463]  You're going to stay here.
[02:26:41.664 --> 02:26:44.285]  You should be against all the other illegal aliens coming in.
[02:26:44.466 --> 02:26:45.807]  They're going to drive down your wages.
[02:26:45.847 --> 02:26:48.028]  But again, it's a pride thing.
[02:26:48.308 --> 02:26:49.649]  Oh no, we're taking over.
[02:26:50.210 --> 02:27:03.039]  And I can show you the documents where the government in the 60s financed your fake liberation theology, your whole La Reconquista La Raza Mecha garbage, and you don't even know it came out of a Madison Avenue...
[02:27:04.449 --> 02:27:05.230]  We're good to go.
[02:27:23.846 --> 02:27:25.367]  The Founding Fathers told us that.
[02:27:25.427 --> 02:27:26.527]  Common sense shows that.
[02:27:26.827 --> 02:27:27.788]  It's time to learn that.
[02:27:28.428 --> 02:27:32.730]  Hartwell, Darrell, Wyatt, Stan will at least be able to take your calls.
[02:27:33.130 --> 02:27:34.390]  Masses of news coming up.
[02:27:34.410 --> 02:27:34.931]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.331 --> 02:27:37.232]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.732 --> 02:27:39.332]  The Empire's on the run.

[02:28:47.923 --> 02:28:58.647]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:59.007 --> 02:29:03.529]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.609 --> 02:29:14.933]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.533 --> 02:29:22.378]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.778 --> 02:29:24.899]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:30.363]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:30.663 --> 02:29:36.966]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.046 --> 02:29:41.229]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:41.469 --> 02:29:42.269]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.807 --> 02:29:53.152]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.372 --> 02:29:58.396]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.716 --> 02:30:06.622]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.782 --> 02:30:13.828]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:14.028 --> 02:30:15.249]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:15.389 --> 02:30:18.791]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:18.851 --> 02:30:21.532]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:30:21.732 --> 02:30:28.556]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:28.676 --> 02:30:31.137]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:30:31.297 --> 02:30:34.238]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.258 --> 02:30:34.298]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.318 --> 02:30:35.279]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:55.655 --> 02:30:56.996]  Every Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:30:57.056 --> 02:30:57.576]  until 2 p.m.
[02:30:57.656 --> 02:31:00.518]  and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:31:00.558 --> 02:31:04.480]  We're here, my friends, defending the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:08.062]  I want to get into this fear-mongering piece out of the Fredericksburg Star.
[02:31:08.583 --> 02:31:15.246]  Technology keeps track of kids, pets, tech options growing, evolving to keep track of children, save from dogs and other predators.
[02:31:15.286 --> 02:31:20.429]  And the moral of the story is, wild dogs will eat your children if they don't have implantable microchips.
[02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:22.851]  I mean, the fear-mongering is getting so ridiculous.
[02:31:23.431 --> 02:31:26.254]  I want to talk about Chinese violently quell new protests.
[02:31:26.294 --> 02:31:28.635]  I mean, they're on the verge of civil war there.
[02:31:28.696 --> 02:31:33.359]  Their people have more of a taste for freedom than we do, folks, because, see, they've never really had it.
[02:31:33.980 --> 02:31:35.241]  And so they're standing up for it.
[02:31:35.661 --> 02:31:39.324]  It's got to get dark, I guess, before people finally wake up.
[02:31:39.744 --> 02:31:43.027]  And I want to give you some of the new developments with the build-up for war with Iran.
[02:31:43.367 --> 02:31:45.129]  We'll also have time to take five calls.
[02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:49.973]  Chris being the last of them, they'll have time to get to here in just a few minutes.
[02:31:52.916 --> 02:31:55.558]  But before I do that, you know, I don't have a lot of sponsors.
[02:31:55.658 --> 02:31:59.601]  I turn down sponsors, frankly, every day that approach me.
[02:32:00.761 --> 02:32:04.904]  I only believe in real things that really have been proven to me personally.
[02:32:04.944 --> 02:32:14.050]  And for almost two years, because for some reason Marty, he was sponsoring the network, so he sent me a two-year supply, two big boxes of soap.
[02:32:14.490 --> 02:32:18.133]  And we used it for about a year and a half, and we used a lot of stuff so it was gone.
[02:32:20.173 --> 02:32:21.653]  And my wife just loved it.
[02:32:21.673 --> 02:32:22.494]  She started ordering more.
[02:32:22.514 --> 02:32:23.854]  She said, why don't you get them as a sponsor?
[02:32:23.874 --> 02:32:24.994]  And I said, you know, that makes sense.
[02:32:25.034 --> 02:32:30.376]  You're already a network sponsor here on the Genesis Network, often imitated, never duplicated.
[02:32:31.716 --> 02:32:33.896]  And, folks, it's triple concentrated.
[02:32:33.916 --> 02:32:35.497]  It's made in America since 1947.
[02:32:35.717 --> 02:32:37.597]  That's getting close to 60 years.
[02:32:37.637 --> 02:32:38.917]  What, 58, 59 years.
[02:32:39.578 --> 02:32:40.778]  It's a family-owned business.
[02:32:41.354 --> 02:32:41.615]  Thank you.
[02:32:41.655 --> 02:32:41.915]  Thank you.
[02:32:52.836 --> 02:32:53.657]  We're good to go.
[02:33:15.755 --> 02:33:25.889]  Is on average about 85% less than even the mainstream toxic stuff and way, way cheaper than the expensive organic stuff, which this stuff is.
[02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:28.792]  So, I mean, it's just an incredible deal.
[02:33:28.812 --> 02:33:30.032]  They've got starter packs.
[02:33:30.072 --> 02:33:31.173]  They've got free catalogs.
[02:33:31.493 --> 02:33:33.255]  They've got year supplies.
[02:33:33.835 --> 02:33:36.757]  You will save so much money on this, and it's non-toxic.
[02:33:37.137 --> 02:33:38.378]  Your children deserve it.
[02:33:38.418 --> 02:33:39.379]  It works so good.
[02:33:39.399 --> 02:33:40.860]  It's been around since 1947.
[02:33:41.941 --> 02:33:47.304]  And, Marty, that's a pretty good plug there for your family business, but I just believe in it.
[02:33:47.344 --> 02:33:48.365]  People have got to call you.
[02:33:49.646 --> 02:33:50.967]  I appreciate that, Alex.
[02:33:51.567 --> 02:33:52.968]  That was a very good plug.
[02:33:53.729 --> 02:33:55.010]  I've been doing this now for...
[02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:57.027]  Oh, gosh.
[02:33:57.488 --> 02:33:58.068]  59 years.
[02:33:59.009 --> 02:34:02.332]  And our slogan here is, our business is going down the drain.
[02:34:02.392 --> 02:34:07.316]  Well, I was just going to add, that's a pretty good plug, but it doesn't go close to telling people how good this is.
[02:34:08.877 --> 02:34:11.640]  Well, we are manufacturing the product.
[02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:15.743]  A question you asked me last time is, why don't I put it on the shelf?
[02:34:16.424 --> 02:34:19.106]  Well, there's a word called slotting.
[02:34:19.659 --> 02:34:22.261]  Most people don't know that because it's an industrial word.
[02:34:22.801 --> 02:34:33.470]  Slotting means that the manufacturers, the billion dollar manufacturers... They make big agreements and muscle out and say we'll give you even lower prices if you refuse competition.
[02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:39.454]  People also wonder why there's so many varieties and smells of the same thing or ten varieties of Gatorade.
[02:34:39.494 --> 02:34:42.877]  It's meant to take over the shelving in slotting, right?
[02:34:43.417 --> 02:34:50.200]  Well, more than that, they're leasing and renting the space, and they control the shelf space in all the markets.
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:52.321]  Can't get in there, unfortunately.
[02:34:53.061 --> 02:35:03.006]  So what we're doing, we decided we will be factory direct, without the middleman, without the distributor, without the jobber, without the wholesaler, without the salesman.
[02:35:03.286 --> 02:35:15.329]  Now, people that now buy from you, finer hotels, hospitals, people that want high-quality products and also save money, you've been around since 1947, but in the last few years, you've been going factory direct.
[02:35:15.809 --> 02:35:16.529]  That's correct.
[02:35:17.169 --> 02:35:18.049]  To the consumer.
[02:35:18.989 --> 02:35:27.031]  Because most of our business, when we got started, was strictly institutional, and, you know, hospitals, schools, convalescent homes.
[02:35:27.331 --> 02:35:29.932]  Well, I'm sorry, Marty, we can't buy from you.
[02:35:29.992 --> 02:35:31.952]  Your factory isn't in China with slaves.
[02:35:32.628 --> 02:35:33.108]  No way.
[02:35:33.148 --> 02:35:34.509]  We're an American company.
[02:35:34.589 --> 02:35:35.570]  We're American people.
[02:35:35.610 --> 02:35:39.332]  I'm going to have to pay 85% more and get something that gives me rashes from China.
[02:35:39.613 --> 02:35:40.613]  Don't need it anymore.
[02:35:40.793 --> 02:35:41.654]  No, I just can't do it.
[02:35:41.734 --> 02:35:42.094]  I have to.
[02:35:43.035 --> 02:35:45.537]  We have pure soaps, not detergents.
[02:35:45.857 --> 02:35:47.938]  Detergents are made from petroleum.
[02:35:48.218 --> 02:35:49.139]  People don't know that.
[02:35:49.479 --> 02:35:51.440]  And you know what the petroleum market is like.
[02:35:51.861 --> 02:35:58.105]  And the smells are the perfumes that cover up the stench of the petroleum products.
[02:35:58.505 --> 02:35:59.906]  You know how oil smells.
[02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:04.252]  Especially reusable oil, especially used oil.
[02:36:04.272 --> 02:36:05.353]  Well, I'll be honest with people.
[02:36:05.373 --> 02:36:12.117]  You know, my hair is starting to fall out, and I don't mind it too much, but I've done some research online about natural ways to keep it from falling out.
[02:36:12.177 --> 02:36:15.759]  And number one, the doctors tell you, start using natural soaps.
[02:36:15.839 --> 02:36:21.702]  These detergent-based lauryl sulfate things that are in all the big shampoos are killing your hair follicles.
[02:36:22.623 --> 02:36:24.244]  That's exactly what's happening.
[02:36:24.284 --> 02:36:26.185]  This is why I try to get the information...
[02:36:26.724 --> 02:36:27.825]  Out to the consumer.
[02:36:28.065 --> 02:36:31.366]  I got a special, special deal for your listeners.
[02:36:31.386 --> 02:36:33.407]  All right, give us the special deal, Marty.
[02:36:33.427 --> 02:36:44.153]  How does $1.69 a week strike you for all your laundry soap, bath soap, air soap, dish soap, cleaning accessories for 208 weeks?
[02:36:44.173 --> 02:36:44.613]  $1.69 a week.
[02:36:44.633 --> 02:36:45.313]  Multiply $1.69 by 208 weeks.
[02:36:45.694 --> 02:36:46.714]  You come up with $350.
[02:36:54.966 --> 02:37:05.150]  For a four-year supply, 210 pounds of triple concentrated pure soap products equal to 2,000 pounds in the supermarket.
[02:37:05.530 --> 02:37:07.231]  And you've got everything there.
[02:37:07.271 --> 02:37:08.491]  You've got shampoos.
[02:37:08.951 --> 02:37:10.372]  You've got the bath soaps.
[02:37:10.412 --> 02:37:16.094]  You've got the stuff to wash the clothes, the soaps to wash the dishes, all of it.
[02:37:16.574 --> 02:37:18.235]  That's $1.69 a week.
[02:37:18.275 --> 02:37:24.158]  That includes the freight, the shipping, the insurance, the handling, everything delivered.
[02:37:24.478 --> 02:37:35.263]  Four big boxes, 210 pounds of pure soap products will last a family of four anywhere from four years to five years.
[02:37:36.204 --> 02:37:43.012]  Okay, how much is it for a four to five year supply?
[02:37:43.392 --> 02:37:43.673]  Pardon?
[02:37:44.213 --> 02:37:46.276]  How much is it for a four to five year supply?
[02:37:46.556 --> 02:37:47.978]  Total, including everything, $350.
[02:37:50.464 --> 02:37:52.285]  You know, I've seen the statistics.
[02:37:52.305 --> 02:37:52.825]  What do you spend?
[02:37:52.865 --> 02:37:56.408]  About 25% of what you spend at the grocery store is on soaps.
[02:37:56.428 --> 02:38:01.050]  The average for the supermarket is around 20% of your total groceries.
[02:38:01.751 --> 02:38:02.291]  Okay, 20, not 25.
[02:38:02.731 --> 02:38:05.573]  Well, then my family must be different because in the past we bought all that stuff.
[02:38:05.893 --> 02:38:07.054]  It's so expensive.
[02:38:07.995 --> 02:38:09.475]  And so what do you spend on average?
[02:38:09.496 --> 02:38:13.158]  I mean, you spend $200 a week at the grocery store, 20% of that.
[02:38:13.178 --> 02:38:16.039]  I mean, so you're talking about massive savings here.
[02:38:16.059 --> 02:38:19.241]  $300 and something bucks for a five-year supply or a four-and-a-half-year supply.
[02:38:19.321 --> 02:38:20.282]  What if I want just a year?
[02:38:20.282 --> 02:38:27.567]  Well folks, listen, I only promote stuff that's real, and I actually sought Marty out, I guess he sought me out years ago, and it was a two year delay for me to
[02:38:45.257 --> 02:38:46.197]  Take him as a sponsor.
[02:38:46.237 --> 02:38:46.958]  I'm not bragging.
[02:38:47.018 --> 02:38:56.041]  I just, frankly, at the end of the day, I care about credibility more than making a dime, so I'm not going to peddle a bunch of magic cures and stuff here on the air.
[02:38:56.261 --> 02:39:00.262]  This is just good old-fashioned, real soap, organic, made out of real products.
[02:39:00.282 --> 02:39:02.643]  They've got all the certificates and documents on their website.
[02:39:02.883 --> 02:39:05.244]  They're not fly-by-night since 1947.
[02:39:05.924 --> 02:39:09.025]  I mean, a year or two, that'll be 60 years.
[02:39:09.486 --> 02:39:13.247]  You need to call this family-owned company right there in Oakland, California.
[02:39:13.667 --> 02:39:15.708]  They'll ship it out to you at my house.
[02:39:15.768 --> 02:39:18.909]  You open up the cabinet in the kitchen.
[02:39:18.989 --> 02:39:20.129]  It's Calvin Pure Soap.
[02:39:20.169 --> 02:39:21.889]  You open up the cabinets in the laundry room.
[02:39:21.929 --> 02:39:22.910]  It's Calvin Pure Soap.
[02:39:23.210 --> 02:39:25.590]  You go up in my... I mean, I was in the shower this morning.
[02:39:25.631 --> 02:39:26.611]  Calvin Pure Soap.
[02:39:26.811 --> 02:39:34.513]  And I've got some other organic soaps and things my wife uses that she buys at the store because we always forget and aren't in the habit of ordering soap over the telephone.
[02:39:34.953 --> 02:39:38.374]  Listen, they make it hard to be healthy and not get ripped off.
[02:39:38.674 --> 02:39:39.675]  You'll save a lot of money.
[02:39:39.715 --> 02:39:40.855]  I feel really good about this.
[02:39:41.986 --> 02:39:44.108]  Go directly to them.
[02:39:44.128 --> 02:39:46.009]  It's 1-800-340-7091.
[02:39:46.029 --> 02:39:46.269]  800-340-7091.
[02:39:46.289 --> 02:39:50.472]  If you want a catalog, call and get one.
[02:39:50.933 --> 02:39:54.075]  What do they want one of those starter packs there, Marty?
[02:39:54.235 --> 02:39:58.879]  The catalogs are free, which covers heavy, heavy details of what we're talking about.
[02:39:58.899 --> 02:40:05.744]  Yeah, it's a nice catalog, but what about the... You can call and get a free one of those, folks, but what about the little starter pack?
[02:40:05.884 --> 02:40:09.447]  What we call a one-to-two-month package.
[02:40:09.507 --> 02:40:10.988]  We call it a one-month tote bag.
[02:40:11.508 --> 02:40:22.069]  It's got four bars of our pure soap, 18 ounces of our laundry soap, 16 ounces of our triple concentrated cocoa butter shampoo, and 16 ounces of our...
[02:40:22.651 --> 02:40:27.014]  Liquid cream soap for pots, pans, utensils, floors, windows, everything.
[02:40:27.235 --> 02:40:28.215]  Book of instructions.
[02:40:28.616 --> 02:40:29.857]  Weighs out six pounds.
[02:40:30.197 --> 02:40:31.898]  With United Parcel to your door.
[02:40:32.258 --> 02:40:35.961]  It's $14 plus United Parcel to your door.
[02:40:35.981 --> 02:40:37.182]  We take any credit card.
[02:40:37.222 --> 02:40:38.944]  We take your personal check.
[02:40:38.984 --> 02:40:39.364]  All right.
[02:40:39.464 --> 02:40:41.265]  Let me fire up that number before we run out of time.
[02:40:41.305 --> 02:40:41.466]  It's 800-340-7091.
[02:40:41.486 --> 02:40:41.526]  800-340-7091.
[02:40:41.566 --> 02:40:42.586]  Or I guess on the web.
[02:40:42.626 --> 02:40:43.767]  People can also go to the web.
[02:40:43.787 --> 02:40:44.548]  Tell them about that.
[02:40:52.694 --> 02:40:55.116]  CalBenPureSoap.com.
[02:40:55.516 --> 02:41:01.200]  That's C-A-L-B-E-N Pure Soap, all one word, CalBenPureSoap.com.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:03.762]  Everything's on there, all the details.
[02:41:03.802 --> 02:41:12.088]  You can see photos of the different packages, the different deals, and there's a big banner on the left-hand side of InfoWars.com to CalBenPureSoap.com or 800-340-7091.
[02:41:12.108 --> 02:41:19.953]  What if somebody wants to, say, fax you an order for a free catalog?
[02:41:19.973 --> 02:41:20.613]  Can they do that, too?
[02:41:20.874 --> 02:41:21.214]  Oh, yes.
[02:41:21.875 --> 02:41:22.395]  No problem.
[02:41:22.415 --> 02:41:22.716]  And that's 510-638-7091.
[02:41:22.736 --> 02:41:22.716]  78.
[02:41:22.856 --> 02:41:24.917]  Okay, it says 7091 here on mine.
[02:41:24.937 --> 02:41:26.638]  I must be learning.
[02:41:26.878 --> 02:41:30.339]  Okay, but the main number is 800-340-7091.
[02:41:30.359 --> 02:41:31.380]  Thanks for coming on, Marty.
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:31.920]  Hey, thank you.
[02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:32.200]  You bet.
[02:41:32.220 --> 02:41:33.641]  God bless you.
[02:41:42.205 --> 02:41:42.505]  You bet.
[02:41:42.525 --> 02:41:43.326]  Take care, my friend.
[02:41:43.386 --> 02:41:46.090]  And again, I believe in it, so we spent, what, eight minutes with Marty.
[02:41:46.650 --> 02:41:48.132]  And we have him on once a month, folks.
[02:41:48.172 --> 02:41:51.516]  I don't normally sit here and infomercial people, but on a few items we do.
[02:41:51.536 --> 02:41:58.485]  I mean, the Made in America high-quality water filters, where you save about $100 buying them through the distributor than you do buying them at the health food store.
[02:41:59.045 --> 02:42:00.025]  at the camping supply.
[02:42:00.386 --> 02:42:05.228]  Videos, books, information to wake people up, and stuff like Pure Made in America soap.
[02:42:05.368 --> 02:42:06.248]  CalbinPureSoap.com.
[02:42:06.268 --> 02:42:08.889]  We're going to link over at InfoWars.com.
[02:42:09.269 --> 02:42:12.451]  Save a lot of money and won't get ripped off and we'll get good stuff.
[02:42:12.731 --> 02:42:14.632]  And won't have all that toxic stuff.
[02:42:15.032 --> 02:42:19.734]  Okay, that aside, let's blast through your calls now because I've still got to get more into some of this other news.
[02:42:21.335 --> 02:42:22.636]  Hartwell called earlier.
[02:42:22.696 --> 02:42:23.557]  We ran out of time.
[02:42:23.897 --> 02:42:25.338]  He wanted to ask a question.
[02:42:26.179 --> 02:42:28.100]  Hartwell, go ahead and restate that question.
[02:42:28.701 --> 02:42:32.624]  They're in Louisiana.
[02:42:32.744 --> 02:42:35.846]  What method did they use to detonate the charges in the buildings?
[02:42:36.387 --> 02:42:37.388]  You answered it.
[02:42:37.588 --> 02:42:38.148]  That's good.
[02:42:38.568 --> 02:42:41.331]  I have a second question.
[02:42:41.771 --> 02:42:45.534]  The twin towers were helped up by steel beams made of mild steel.
[02:42:46.374 --> 02:42:51.178]  I have a chart here saying that mild steel melts at 2730 degrees.
[02:42:51.198 --> 02:42:53.119]  Does that sound right to you?
[02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:56.302]  Well, I'm not an expert on it.
[02:42:56.322 --> 02:43:04.008]  We've interviewed the physicists and the underwriter laboratory people and we've talked to the experts who built it.
[02:43:04.569 --> 02:43:09.813]  And it was built of structural hardened steel that begins to redden
[02:43:10.653 --> 02:43:10.753]  Right.
[02:43:10.833 --> 02:43:13.754]  And then as for how they detonated the bombs, I don't know how they detonated them.
[02:43:13.774 --> 02:43:17.655]  We just know there were bombs in the buildings from the blast points and how they collapsed.
[02:43:38.755 --> 02:43:44.018]  Well, I was going back to Eric Huffsmith's video, Painful Deceptions.
[02:43:44.298 --> 02:43:44.578]  Yes.
[02:43:44.818 --> 02:43:50.662]  And if I remember right, he said that the beams were made of mild steel, and that's what I was going by.
[02:43:50.702 --> 02:43:58.186]  I believe the calculation is that even if you use mild steel, which I believe is weaker, it still doesn't start melting until 2700.
[02:43:59.246 --> 02:44:01.788]  But those were built out of structural hardened steel.
[02:44:02.288 --> 02:44:02.808]  I think.
[02:44:03.069 --> 02:44:04.329]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:44:04.409 --> 02:44:06.451]  Thank you for answering my questions, and may God bless you.
[02:44:06.591 --> 02:44:08.012]  God bless you too, my friend.
[02:44:08.612 --> 02:44:10.913]  Let's talk to Darrell in Florida.
[02:44:10.973 --> 02:44:13.715]  I believe he wanted to talk about Sybil Evans, but we were unable to.
[02:44:13.775 --> 02:44:14.135]  Go ahead.
[02:44:14.616 --> 02:44:21.280]  Yeah, I wanted to talk to your guest, but I didn't... She's gone, so maybe you can answer this question.
[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:30.765]  Last night I was listening to GCN, and I heard that they could... With the Constitution...
[02:44:33.134 --> 02:44:38.320]  That they could take over the government and some 800 judges that are crooked.
[02:44:39.702 --> 02:44:41.083]  That we could take them over.
[02:44:42.105 --> 02:44:46.310]  And is there a way that you could take them out of office with our military?
[02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:48.392]  Thank you for the call.
[02:44:48.412 --> 02:44:49.774]  Let me try to answer that question.
[02:44:51.352 --> 02:44:53.594]  Government is not reason, it is force.
[02:44:53.634 --> 02:44:55.055]  It is not eloquence, it is force.
[02:44:55.695 --> 02:45:10.986]  The Declaration of Independence says that when the government becomes destructive of the things listed in that Declaration of Independence, the people's life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, property, habeas corpus, common law, it isn't just our right, it's our duty.
[02:45:11.086 --> 02:45:16.110]  The problem is if we try to go physically remove this criminal government before we've told everybody it's criminal...
[02:45:16.850 --> 02:45:17.731]  We're good to go.
[02:45:17.751 --> 02:45:17.911]  I think?
[02:45:43.177 --> 02:45:47.544]  Who have methodically gone and educated other people, which is what the founding fathers did.
[02:45:48.146 --> 02:45:52.393]  You take the Republic of Texas, and I don't mean everybody in it, but a lot of them I've met and seen.
[02:45:52.433 --> 02:45:54.596]  I mean, it's power-mad ne'er-do-wells.
[02:45:55.419 --> 02:45:57.701]  I mean, you know, if you've got a bass boat, you're an admiral.
[02:45:58.181 --> 02:46:00.783]  If you're missing all your front teeth, you're a brigadier general.
[02:46:01.203 --> 02:46:02.484]  I mean, there are no privates.
[02:46:02.504 --> 02:46:09.589]  There's nothing but generals and insane people declaring them supreme rulers and writing insane letters to France saying they're the embassy.
[02:46:10.089 --> 02:46:12.911]  And, you know, you have five different presidents all fighting with each other.
[02:46:13.371 --> 02:46:15.473]  The founding fathers didn't go, we're the presidents.
[02:46:15.873 --> 02:46:21.218]  They said, you're criminals, you're out of control, we're going to set up our own colonial governments on a state-by-state basis.
[02:46:21.518 --> 02:46:27.503]  It wasn't until years into the war that they then said, we're going to be a new nation and a new country.
[02:46:28.324 --> 02:46:32.588]  And so, you know, the problem is we've been led by the wrong people.
[02:46:32.628 --> 02:46:35.230]  And I'm not even saying I'm of the caliber to lead people.
[02:46:36.105 --> 02:46:37.966]  It just needs to be serious and focused.
[02:46:38.026 --> 02:46:39.006]  Through the state houses.
[02:46:39.306 --> 02:46:42.167]  We're on the verge of having Vermont, New Hampshire, Arizona.
[02:46:42.647 --> 02:46:45.168]  Other state houses are openly talking about seceding.
[02:46:45.528 --> 02:46:51.410]  And I don't even mean a full secession, a limited secession like South Carolina attempted under Andrew Jackson.
[02:46:51.690 --> 02:46:52.610]  But he foiled that.
[02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:55.311]  It wasn't needed then, it's needed today.
[02:46:55.911 --> 02:47:02.555]  To say, we're still in the Union, but we disregard your Tenth Amendment-violating, overarching systems.
[02:47:02.875 --> 02:47:07.617]  We re-declare the Tenth Amendment sovereignty we had as part of this Confederacy.
[02:47:08.778 --> 02:47:10.639]  And I don't mean the Confederacy of the 1860s.
[02:47:11.159 --> 02:47:14.141]  I mean the true Confederacy that was the 13 colonies before that.
[02:47:14.461 --> 02:47:16.162]  Then that gets all into political science.
[02:47:17.478 --> 02:47:25.925]  But we need to set about first showing people what the Bill of Rights and Constitution is, showing how it's been violated, and then going to reprove this government.
[02:47:26.065 --> 02:47:27.767]  So many people focus at the federal level.
[02:47:27.787 --> 02:47:32.471]  You're not going to take their tallest, most powerful fortress first.
[02:47:32.511 --> 02:47:37.455]  You've got to take their lesser kingdoms and domains first, back into the people's control.
[02:47:37.715 --> 02:47:40.858]  That's your county, your city, your water district, your city council.
[02:47:41.898 --> 02:47:42.879]  Your school board.
[02:47:43.699 --> 02:47:45.080]  That's where you can foil them.
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:56.345]  The state legislature seats, the state senate seats, the state assemblyman seats, the seats at all of these levels can be used.
[02:47:57.326 --> 02:47:59.647]  The sheriffs are absolutely paramount.
[02:48:00.407 --> 02:48:07.911]  And so at those points, and that is happening, by the way, you're just not going to hear the enemy admit it's going on, but we have heralded these wonderful happenings
[02:48:09.156 --> 02:48:11.381]  And more and more people in the federal government are talking like we are.
[02:48:19.073 --> 02:48:19.814]  More and more of them.
[02:48:20.414 --> 02:48:21.575]  So many prominent people.
[02:48:21.635 --> 02:48:23.096]  So our numbers are actually growing.
[02:48:23.436 --> 02:48:33.662]  We don't want them to trick us through provocateurs or through camp followers of the provocateurs into premature engagement physically.
[02:48:34.043 --> 02:48:34.483]  Don't worry.
[02:48:34.503 --> 02:48:37.205]  The globalists are going to start blowing stuff up and come for us physically.
[02:48:37.525 --> 02:48:41.027]  And at that point, we've got to roll them up when it's obvious they're the terrorists.
[02:48:41.247 --> 02:48:42.828]  Let the redcoats come for the guns.
[02:48:43.128 --> 02:48:43.849]  Let it come.
[02:48:44.029 --> 02:48:45.570]  And when they come, we're going to whip them.
[02:48:46.272 --> 02:48:50.596]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.796 --> 02:48:55.160]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:57.816 --> 02:48:59.778]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:48:59.859 --> 02:49:02.662]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:49:02.922 --> 02:49:07.148]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.208 --> 02:49:14.156]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.276 --> 02:49:16.299]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.519 --> 02:49:26.966]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.266 --> 02:49:32.650]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:49:55.940 --> 02:50:06.307]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:06.467 --> 02:50:10.830]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.

[02:51:51.774 --> 02:52:03.763]  By the way, folks, tomorrow night I'm going to be on Coast to Coast Day for three hours talking about this whole police state spy society.
[02:52:06.445 --> 02:52:10.289]  And I'm, of course, going to be doing an interview with Tex Morris on his show, but that will air in about a week.
[02:52:10.349 --> 02:52:11.489]  Just some side notes there.
[02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:14.672]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wyatt in Maryland.
[02:52:14.732 --> 02:52:15.773]  Wyatt, good to talk to you.
[02:52:16.886 --> 02:52:17.586]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:52:17.667 --> 02:52:17.967]  Good, sir.
[02:52:18.207 --> 02:52:18.727]  Good afternoon.
[02:52:18.747 --> 02:52:29.295]  Yeah, I was listening to Canadian Broadcasting this morning, and they interviewed a professor at the University of Texas, and his name is Dr. Kozel.
[02:52:29.355 --> 02:52:32.517]  I'm not sure exactly how that's spelled, but it sounds like K-O-Z-E-L.
[02:52:32.977 --> 02:52:34.858]  He's an assistant medical professor.
[02:52:35.759 --> 02:52:38.701]  You might want to be interested in looking into him.
[02:52:39.422 --> 02:52:44.305]  What they're doing is, according to the host, there's homeland security money,
[02:52:45.128 --> 02:52:46.993]  And Defense Department money.
[02:52:47.194 --> 02:52:49.460]  Yeah, they're going to have, what, bioweapons development?
[02:52:49.941 --> 02:52:51.124]  No, it's for MRIs.
[02:52:52.192 --> 02:52:55.155]  To be used as part of... Oh, to tell if we have colds.
[02:52:55.435 --> 02:52:58.157]  No, to tell if you're telling the truth.
[02:52:58.878 --> 02:53:00.659]  Oh, yeah, they've already put those in the airports.
[02:53:00.699 --> 02:53:02.041]  It's a total scam.
[02:53:03.061 --> 02:53:06.604]  They prove lie detectors are a fraud, so they move on to an MRI.
[02:53:07.185 --> 02:53:08.186]  These passive MRIs.
[02:53:08.226 --> 02:53:11.909]  I was trying to guess, because I know UT is involved in every evil you can imagine.
[02:53:11.969 --> 02:53:12.189]  Right.
[02:53:12.730 --> 02:53:17.934]  She had three other guests on, and she only said their name once, so I didn't catch it.
[02:53:18.399 --> 02:53:23.320]  But there's a guy out of Boston... Yeah, they're putting brain scanners up in the airports.
[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:25.161]  They're already, I was about to say, Boston put it in.
[02:53:25.521 --> 02:53:25.641]  Right.
[02:53:25.701 --> 02:53:30.042]  I saw that on CBS News three years ago, and I've got the article somewhere.
[02:53:30.082 --> 02:53:31.862]  Yeah, brain scanners are in the airport.
[02:53:32.122 --> 02:53:33.463]  And, of course, it's a total fraud.
[02:53:33.503 --> 02:53:34.823]  I mean, it's just their excuse.
[02:53:35.143 --> 02:53:37.564]  Well, what they want to do is... Well, the computer says you're a terrorist.
[02:53:37.584 --> 02:53:40.725]  Yeah, what they want to do is... We've got to watch the farmers with satellites.
[02:53:40.745 --> 02:53:41.625]  They could be Al-Qaeda.
[02:53:41.685 --> 02:53:42.005]  I'm sorry.
[02:53:42.465 --> 02:53:52.573]  They want to use this for people who are, and eventually it will be administered by court decision to determine whether you're telling the truth or not.
[02:53:53.241 --> 02:53:56.323]  And it's eventually... And nobody can look under the hood.
[02:53:56.363 --> 02:53:57.463]  It's proprietary.
[02:53:57.703 --> 02:54:00.425]  Well, the company just says it shows you're lying.
[02:54:00.545 --> 02:54:00.785]  Right.
[02:54:00.825 --> 02:54:07.228]  Well, eventually, what they said, would this possibility eliminate a jury trial?
[02:54:08.189 --> 02:54:08.929]  Of course they did.
[02:54:09.169 --> 02:54:14.432]  The National Association of Lawyers, the National... What is it called?
[02:54:14.492 --> 02:54:15.592]  I'm having one of those moments.
[02:54:15.672 --> 02:54:16.893]  Bar Association?
[02:54:16.913 --> 02:54:21.916]  Yes, the National Bar Association has been lobbying for four years to get rid of juries.
[02:54:21.956 --> 02:54:22.576]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:23.604 --> 02:54:25.085]  Oh, I was about to go to Stan and he hung up.
[02:54:25.165 --> 02:54:25.325]  Why?
[02:54:25.345 --> 02:54:25.826]  He's still there?
[02:54:26.626 --> 02:54:26.747]  Why?
[02:54:26.787 --> 02:54:27.567]  It's gone too.
[02:54:27.587 --> 02:54:28.648]  I don't have time for anybody else.
[02:54:28.968 --> 02:54:31.030]  Stan, I was hurrying to get to you and you hung up.
[02:54:31.390 --> 02:54:32.251]  You'd had two minutes.
[02:54:32.431 --> 02:54:33.272]  I can't go to the other people.
[02:54:33.312 --> 02:54:33.712]  I'm sorry.
[02:54:34.853 --> 02:54:38.596]  No, I mean, look, they're getting rid of juries in England for almost everything now.
[02:54:38.856 --> 02:54:39.917]  They're getting rid of them here.
[02:54:40.677 --> 02:54:41.738]  They're moving to do it.
[02:54:42.939 --> 02:54:47.663]  It's just, again, that'll stop Al-Qaeda, I guess, having brain scanners everywhere.
[02:54:47.723 --> 02:54:50.725]  But we're going to legalize all the illegal aliens, but it is an amnesty.
[02:54:51.789 --> 02:54:53.431]  It makes my head spin.
[02:54:54.433 --> 02:54:59.942]  Oh, the NSA's only spying on you for your own good, but oh, the government's also looking at your farms with a...
[02:55:01.187 --> 02:55:01.868]  With these systems.
[02:55:02.708 --> 02:55:09.434]  I'm not going to say the guy's name, don't worry, but we just got an order for one of the videos and it said Fort Meade.
[02:55:09.774 --> 02:55:10.414]  I'm not kidding.
[02:55:10.855 --> 02:55:17.880]  So Kevin, who works here, calls the number because the note on it says, sorry for the things we do.
[02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:19.462]  I don't know what that means.
[02:55:19.902 --> 02:55:24.986]  He calls and I think he called Fort Meade and the persons at work at
[02:55:25.026 --> 02:55:25.886]  The NSA.
[02:55:26.627 --> 02:55:27.967]  We're sitting there talking to them.
[02:55:28.367 --> 02:55:31.208]  I told her by office, I said, we don't want to know anything classified.
[02:55:32.269 --> 02:55:34.190]  Besides, the guy wasn't telling us anything classified.
[02:55:37.191 --> 02:55:39.091]  But at the same time, because we don't need to know.
[02:55:39.452 --> 02:55:40.892]  We can see the manifestation.
[02:55:41.032 --> 02:55:44.053]  I know everything you're doing by watching your attack pattern.
[02:55:44.513 --> 02:55:46.694]  I know everything you're doing by your operations.
[02:55:46.714 --> 02:55:48.955]  Your past operations, because I know you duplicate.
[02:55:49.816 --> 02:55:51.956]  And because we can see what you're doing on the ground.
[02:55:53.097 --> 02:55:53.417]  You see?
[02:55:55.043 --> 02:56:02.947]  And then I can also go to people you've tried to get involved in your operations, say like emergency managers who aren't under national security, and they can tell me everything you told them.
[02:56:03.727 --> 02:56:06.108]  So see, we go right around all that.
[02:56:06.709 --> 02:56:08.009]  We just walk right around it.
[02:56:09.050 --> 02:56:12.671]  But you've got to be careful with that stuff when people try to give you classified info.
[02:56:13.192 --> 02:56:15.153]  It is a daily problem around here.
[02:56:15.973 --> 02:56:20.575]  But that wasn't an instance of it a few minutes ago.
[02:56:20.595 --> 02:56:22.496]  That was just some of the good folks in government.
[02:56:22.896 --> 02:56:23.657]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:56:23.717 --> 02:56:24.037]  Take care.
