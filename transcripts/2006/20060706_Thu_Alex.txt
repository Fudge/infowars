[00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:06.551]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.212 --> 00:00:08.293]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:10.114]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:11.574]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:13.235]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:17.518]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:22.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.302]  Music
[00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:45.448]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:45.889]  Welcome.
[00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.674]  Thank you for joining us on this July 7, 2006 Thursday edition.
[00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:53.816]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:57.559]  We're going to be here live for the next two hours and 59 minutes.
[00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:00.278]  We're good to go.
[00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:00.599]  I think?
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:30.307]  Man raided by FBI, ATF, Canadian law enforcement, that's right, foreign police here in America, after handing out subversive Alex Jones material.
[00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:34.230]  Gun seller questioned on militia ownership.
[00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:40.194]  Again, gun seller questioned on militia ownership of George Washington's speeches.
[00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:47.900]  And they specifically brought up evil speeches that he had of George Washington comments.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:58.186]  Some of my videos, Police State 3 Total Enslavement specifically, and of course other Patriot type material.
[00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:04.189]  And if anyone doubts this, we have training manuals from Virginia, Texas, Arizona.
[00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.834]  I've even got some out of Indianapolis, Indiana from a federal police that I was able to obtain a copy from.
[00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:15.656]  We have video of FEMA on tape.
[00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:41.644]  Saying that the Founding Fathers are terrorists, Christians are terrorists, we have their own training manuals where they list homeschoolers as terrorists, we have the Associated Press from now almost three years ago out of Michigan where they had the takeover drills at the school telling small children that they were homeschoolers there to kill them, which is basically mind control torture.
[00:02:42.564 --> 00:02:44.044]  All of this is happening and
[00:02:46.235 --> 00:03:04.621]  Time and time again, we are even getting it on the record, where judges, state police, FBI, and others, there was even an episode of cops, where they pulled somebody over and they had a copy of one of my videos, and they went ahead and arrested him.
[00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:11.804]  The police have been trained that freedom, that everything that stands for the 4th of July, is terrorist.
[00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:15.029]  We're good to go.
[00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:39.601]  Coming on, but we also are going to have Aaron Zellman, Jews Preservation and Firearms Ownership, joining us, who was also brought up.
[00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:42.363]  They had been reading this man's email.
[00:03:42.423 --> 00:03:45.885]  They had been digging through some of his communiques.
[00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:49.607]  They were very upset that he liked Aaron Zellman.
[00:03:50.027 --> 00:03:52.549]  They were very upset that he was politically involved.
[00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:01.814]  All of this started when he brought the sheriff, some of my videos and some other materials, as an American citizen, trying to educate his county sheriff.
[00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:12.887]  And so the response he got for being involved in the community was a huge FBI, BATF, and Canadian law enforcement raid on his home.
[00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:22.534]  I mean, how shameful, how bizarre, how out of control is it going to have to get before the American people wake up?
[00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:28.079]  We've already witnessed wholesale gun confiscation in New Orleans and outlying surrounding areas.
[00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.419]  So we'll be getting into this report.
[00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.860]  In fact, I've got some comments before the guest even joins us.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.441]  I'll do that after the break.
[00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:39.722]  Things are heating up with the Taiwan situation now, wanting their own missiles.
[00:04:40.203 --> 00:04:46.505]  Japan wanting their own missiles, both offensive and defensive, thanks to the activities of North Korea.
[00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:48.245]  Test firing now, we're told, 10 missiles.
[00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.646]  And they said they're going to test more missiles.
[00:04:51.846 --> 00:04:53.387]  Bush is saber-rattling over it.
[00:04:54.404 --> 00:04:55.185]  That's coming up.
[00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:58.790]  Just a lot of important news and information for you today.
[00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.211]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.508 --> 00:05:08.352]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.652 --> 00:05:10.033]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:12.434]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.594 --> 00:05:14.675]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.955 --> 00:05:19.898]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:24.240]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.281]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:37.005]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:39.045]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:43.127]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:44.647]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:44.687 --> 00:05:44.868]  That's 888-2533-139.

[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.282]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:04.356]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:04.636 --> 00:06:08.138]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.218 --> 00:06:12.160]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:18.543]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:26.868]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.268 --> 00:06:32.609]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:36.530]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.750]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.991]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:45.811]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:51.932]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.459]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:05.119]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.980]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.980]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.301]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:20.062]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:21.963]  Now they look and feel great.
[00:07:22.303 --> 00:07:25.763]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:28.984]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:32.942]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:07:33.403 --> 00:07:35.304]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:07:36.024 --> 00:07:39.206]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:46.309]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.291]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:50.111]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:51.592]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:06.309]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:08.990]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:18.876]  The government is criminal.
[00:08:19.396 --> 00:08:22.818]  At the top, it is completely and totally criminal.
[00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:26.240]  It is a global organized crime syndicate.
[00:08:27.213 --> 00:08:38.881]  Totally arrogant, full of hubris, believing that we are the slaves of this government and its controllers and owners, and that we have absolutely no right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
[00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:44.245]  The United States is going from freedom into total and complete tyranny.
[00:08:46.106 --> 00:08:51.350]  Remember a few years ago there was the case of the man, prominent business owner, no criminal record,
[00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:58.232]  He puts up a sign in his yard, even outside the judge's jurisdiction, saying our court system is a joke.
[00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:04.315]  The judge drives by it and says he doesn't appreciate it, even gives a press conference admitting it.
[00:09:04.695 --> 00:09:10.658]  So he sends out the sheriff's deputies to arrest the man at his home and to steal the signs.
[00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:16.241]  Remember the case of Lyon County...
[00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:18.141]  Kentucky.
[00:09:18.362 --> 00:09:19.442]  And Kelly Rushing.
[00:09:19.602 --> 00:09:21.183]  Again, prominent family in the town.
[00:09:21.564 --> 00:09:22.384]  Business owner.
[00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:24.726]  Ten church every Sunday.
[00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:25.987]  No criminal records.
[00:09:26.147 --> 00:09:27.528]  Upstanding in the community.
[00:09:28.348 --> 00:09:31.850]  And there it was, right there in the Lyon County newspaper.
[00:09:32.331 --> 00:09:33.632]  I called the judge at his home.
[00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:34.552]  He admitted it to me.
[00:09:34.572 --> 00:09:36.654]  I called Kelly Rushing's neighbors.
[00:09:36.674 --> 00:09:37.874]  This was like three years ago.
[00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:39.695]  I couldn't believe it myself.
[00:09:39.756 --> 00:09:43.318]  So I randomly was calling people there in the town.
[00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:48.341]  And I called the judge up on a Sunday and talked to him in his house.
[00:09:49.483 --> 00:09:58.520]  Kelly Rushing, no criminal record, gave a copy of a C-SPAN tape titled Neocond.
[00:10:00.195 --> 00:10:20.632]  44-minute speech by Congressman Ron Paul of Texas, of the 14th District, where he laid out from mainstream media reports the fact that the entire neocon agenda is Trotskyite, that they were Trotskyites, and that they are not conservative and they are destroying America.
[00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:24.735]  Now imagine, he goes and he gives this to a state trooper, and the state trooper watches it,
[00:10:25.549 --> 00:10:28.510]  He also gave him one of my videos, Police State 2000, and Road to Terror.
[00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.631]  He gave him two of those on the same tape.
[00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:34.313]  The cop goes home, but was particularly in court.
[00:10:34.353 --> 00:10:36.014]  This came out upset by the congressman.
[00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:37.855]  Now imagine, you're a police officer.
[00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:38.895]  You're a state trooper.
[00:10:38.935 --> 00:10:47.519]  You plug a videotape into a machine, and you think that a congressman in the well of the house, in the Capitol, you think it's illegal.
[00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:49.240]  With C-SPAN on the screen.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.142]  This is how brainwashed and stupid and wicked these individuals are.
[00:10:55.596 --> 00:11:00.339]  This is leading into a news story, folks, but I'm going to give you some background for those that missed this report.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.820]  We do have written reports on this.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:09.063]  Just type in Kelly Rushing arrested into Google and it should pop up for you.
[00:11:10.664 --> 00:11:14.126]  It's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com deep in the archives.
[00:11:16.587 --> 00:11:22.630]  And so the next day, or two days later to be precise, Kelly Rushing is driving to work.
[00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:24.391]  All of a sudden,
[00:11:25.339 --> 00:11:27.020]  State Trooper pulls him over.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.840]  He says, yes sir, how can I help you?
[00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:35.003]  He goes, those videotapes you gave me, get out of the car, you're under arrest, those are illegal, they're anti-law enforcement.
[00:11:35.723 --> 00:11:42.126]  He puts him in the back of his squad car, he calls his wife, and he starts saying, I've got the videotape bandit, he's laughing.
[00:11:42.873 --> 00:11:44.676]  And Kelly, he says, why did you give me that?
[00:11:44.716 --> 00:11:45.677]  Why did you threaten me?
[00:11:45.697 --> 00:11:46.739]  Those videos are threatening.
[00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:49.363]  And Kelly Rushing said, I'm not threatening you, sir.
[00:11:49.403 --> 00:11:50.925]  I care about you and your family.
[00:11:51.325 --> 00:11:53.449]  You need to know what's going on in this country, sir.
[00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:55.331]  I did that because I thought you should be informed.
[00:11:55.712 --> 00:11:57.154]  The cop then spins that...
[00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.816]  And by the way, it's all being recorded in the car.
[00:11:59.856 --> 00:12:01.136]  This all came out in court later.
[00:12:01.176 --> 00:12:04.218]  And of course, in front of the jury, it all blew up in front of their face.
[00:12:04.698 --> 00:12:05.498]  They called it a threat.
[00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:09.260]  Nurse Kelly, being recorded in the car, saying, no, I care about you and your family.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.222]  The cops tried to turn that into a threat, saying, I care about you and your family.
[00:12:14.242 --> 00:12:16.123]  I thought you would care about them and want to know the truth.
[00:12:17.344 --> 00:12:24.007]  Paraphrasing the quote, it's almost the exact quote, but... The article has all the actual exact quotes.
[00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:26.828]  So all that happens, and they go ahead and...
[00:12:27.443 --> 00:12:28.844]  Kelly demands a jury trial.
[00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:31.026]  The jury's called in.
[00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:33.088]  The trial goes on for several days.
[00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:36.972]  They show the squad car video with the audio inside.
[00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:43.258]  The video's projecting out of the front of the squad car, but there's audio being recorded off a lapel microphone.
[00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:46.381]  The state police wear a mic either on their tie or on their shirt.
[00:12:47.515 --> 00:12:48.456]  They record all this.
[00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:51.837]  Of course, this is really evidence of the criminality of the state trooper.
[00:12:52.258 --> 00:12:53.058]  But see, they don't care.
[00:12:53.278 --> 00:13:02.223]  They're so warped that they think this type of Soviet gulag archipelago, Alexander Schultz needs some persecution type stuff is good.
[00:13:02.503 --> 00:13:03.704]  They think it's normal.
[00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:07.246]  And so the judge throws the book at him.
[00:13:07.906 --> 00:13:11.088]  Two different threats to a police officer per videotape he was given.
[00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:18.581]  They go ahead and try to put him in jail on two different counts of three years apiece.
[00:13:20.783 --> 00:13:24.405]  And after two days of the trial, the jury gets up and finds him not guilty.
[00:13:24.465 --> 00:13:34.011]  Now imagine, this cop was going to sleep good at night, the judge was going to sleep good at night, the prosecutor was going to sleep good at night, sending a man with no criminal record to jail.
[00:13:34.632 --> 00:13:39.255]  This went to trial for a Ron Paul and Alex Jones videos.
[00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:40.736]  Okay?
[00:13:41.681 --> 00:13:46.563]  And footage I've put together, films I've made, you know, have even aired on national TV channels like Trio Network.
[00:13:46.603 --> 00:13:48.163]  They've aired on Channel 4 in England.
[00:13:48.183 --> 00:13:50.144]  They've aired on Japanese television.
[00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:57.547]  Again, my stuff's pretty, quote, radical because it tells the truth, but it's mainstream.
[00:14:00.808 --> 00:14:01.768]  And I talked to the judge.
[00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:04.509]  I'll never forget calling him at his house and going, hello, judge.
[00:14:05.529 --> 00:14:07.050]  And, of course, I wasn't going to record it.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:07.940]  We're good to go.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.381]  We're good to go.
[00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:39.624]  And so, because it criticizes the police state and shows the Marines trying to take our guns, and because it shows Ron Paul saying George Bush is a conservative and is a traitor, it's illegal.
[00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:45.909]  And at the end of the trial, I got mad at Kelly about this because the day after the trial, we had Kelly on.
[00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:52.535]  And Kelly said that he walked up, turning the other cheek, what a good man.
[00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:53.796]  But I still got mad at him.
[00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:57.543]  Kelly went up to the state trooper and tried to shake his hand.
[00:14:58.123 --> 00:14:59.884]  And the guy really wouldn't do it, tried to pull away.
[00:15:00.785 --> 00:15:03.306]  And Kelly said, I'm sorry about all this trouble.
[00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.747]  And the cop turned and just walked away.
[00:15:06.588 --> 00:15:10.110]  And I told Kelly that day, I said, buddy, they're going to be after you now.
[00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.031]  Believe me, these aren't good people.
[00:15:12.091 --> 00:15:16.834]  This guy tried to put you in prison for, what, six years with both counts.
[00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:18.995]  Sure enough...
[00:15:19.795 --> 00:15:20.635]  I think we're good to go.
[00:15:43.436 --> 00:15:45.597]  How dare you not want to spend six years in prison?
[00:15:45.977 --> 00:15:49.738]  How dare you, when we take you to court, stand up for yourself and demand a jury?
[00:15:50.238 --> 00:15:50.958]  How dare you?
[00:15:51.579 --> 00:15:58.941]  We're here to make jokes to our wives and send you to prison and just have no empathy or no connection to justice or anything.
[00:16:01.802 --> 00:16:03.102]  Folks, I'm not kidding about this.
[00:16:03.182 --> 00:16:05.683]  Now let's move back years before that to the road to tyranny.
[00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:12.385]  A few months before 9-11, a firefighter in Kansas City, Missouri,
[00:16:13.852 --> 00:16:19.538]  Sends me an 18 hours of videotape.
[00:16:19.558 --> 00:16:32.671]  18 hours of videotape from over two days of seminars that they were forced to go to with this special forces type FEMA guy up there at the head of the police and firemen and sheriff's deputies saying, quote, George Washington's a terrorist.
[00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:34.873]  The Constitution's bad.
[00:16:35.173 --> 00:16:36.054]  On and on and on.
[00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:37.656]  Christians are terrorists.
[00:16:38.662 --> 00:16:39.902]  All Christians are terrorists.
[00:16:40.163 --> 00:16:43.604]  And then I have all the training manuals from all over the country, federal, state, local.
[00:16:44.164 --> 00:16:45.244]  We have other video clips.
[00:16:45.284 --> 00:16:46.945]  And then we don't just have video of the training.
[00:16:46.985 --> 00:16:50.826]  We have state police in Rockmount, Virginia.
[00:16:51.626 --> 00:16:55.027]  The state police in Rockmount, Virginia.
[00:16:56.668 --> 00:16:57.328]  Think about this.
[00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:04.368]  And they pull over Abby Newman, naval veteran, no criminal record, been in town buying canning supplies.
[00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:06.030]  They want to search her car.
[00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:06.811]  It's all on video.
[00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:07.753]  She says, no you can't.
[00:17:07.773 --> 00:17:08.874]  This is a random checkpoint.
[00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.036]  They're randomly searching the cars.
[00:17:10.623 --> 00:17:11.904]  She says, you have to have a warrant for that.
[00:17:11.924 --> 00:17:12.884]  They say, get out of the car.
[00:17:12.924 --> 00:17:14.044]  She says, no, I have rights.
[00:17:14.364 --> 00:17:15.625]  Then they pull her out of the car.
[00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:16.665]  She doesn't resist.
[00:17:16.985 --> 00:17:19.066]  They go ahead and say, we're going to charge you with resisting.
[00:17:19.086 --> 00:17:20.807]  Again, false charges on videotape.
[00:17:20.987 --> 00:17:22.247]  This is out of their own squad car.
[00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.528]  But they don't understand.
[00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:29.410]  They have been so indoctrinated in criminality and un-American activities that they think this is just normal.
[00:17:30.611 --> 00:17:31.811]  Then they start digging through the trunk.
[00:17:31.871 --> 00:17:33.132]  They find Police State 2000.
[00:17:34.212 --> 00:17:36.853]  They find a pocket constitution.
[00:17:36.893 --> 00:17:39.354]  They find a Patriot Games video.
[00:17:40.379 --> 00:17:42.640]  Which is a Hollywood film with Harrison Ford.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.481]  They think it's all terrorists.
[00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.741]  They say, is this legal?
[00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:46.521]  We don't know.
[00:17:47.021 --> 00:17:49.722]  One cop asks the other state trooper, is this legal?
[00:17:49.762 --> 00:17:51.343]  He says it may be.
[00:17:51.983 --> 00:17:52.804]  On and on and on.
[00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:57.585]  They start reading it about the Constitution, reading quotes, going, man, this is paraphernalia.
[00:17:57.605 --> 00:17:58.846]  She's one of them radicals.
[00:18:00.186 --> 00:18:01.927]  Yeah, she's not the average American who...
[00:18:03.502 --> 00:18:08.566]  Can't find Iraq on a map, doesn't know their state capital, is totally stupid, but knows all about American Idol.
[00:18:08.766 --> 00:18:09.707]  You're absolutely right.
[00:18:09.747 --> 00:18:10.487]  She's a radical.
[00:18:11.668 --> 00:18:15.351]  She thinks the moon isn't made of cheese, and she thinks the earth's round, not flat.
[00:18:16.052 --> 00:18:19.875]  And so they take her to jail, and they charge her with all that stuff, and she again was found not guilty.
[00:18:21.776 --> 00:18:23.417]  That's the new America.
[00:18:24.578 --> 00:18:25.839]  That's what we've become.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:33.145]  And I've got example after example after example after example after example of this, and I'm not going to belabor those today.
[00:18:33.945 --> 00:18:35.045]  But none of this scares me.
[00:18:35.065 --> 00:18:36.186]  This is not a chilling effect.
[00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:37.366]  This shouldn't scare you.
[00:18:37.446 --> 00:18:45.249]  It should embolden you to stand up against these, number one, stupid crooks, is what the state police are when they act like this.
[00:18:46.729 --> 00:18:52.851]  I'm not saying all police are like this, but the feds, through the training, are attempting to set up this mindset.
[00:18:55.232 --> 00:18:57.013]  It's the same thing in England, same thing in Canada.
[00:18:57.873 --> 00:19:00.654]  Up in Canada, they arrest people out there protesting the Bilderberg Group.
[00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:05.715]  Take one of them behind a closed door, threaten to cut his arms off, threaten to go after his family.
[00:19:07.616 --> 00:19:13.039]  They bring myself up, say I'm an insurgent, I believe was the quote.
[00:19:14.059 --> 00:19:16.060]  Well, it's the same thing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.603]  Now we have gun owners of America and Jews of the Preservation of Firearms ownership on the record concerning this.
[00:19:21.623 --> 00:19:24.164]  So we've got big groups on record.
[00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:24.765]  This happened.
[00:19:27.126 --> 00:19:27.706]  This happened.
[00:19:28.947 --> 00:19:31.068]  And, of course, I was brought up, as usual,
[00:19:33.576 --> 00:19:35.496]  I mean, the minute they can, folks.
[00:19:36.156 --> 00:19:40.057]  They'd love to send a bunch of goons over here, take me to jail cell, and beat my brains out.
[00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:40.957]  They'll do it.
[00:19:41.417 --> 00:19:44.818]  They'll Abu Ghraib me in ten seconds when they think they can get away with it.
[00:19:45.438 --> 00:19:46.438]  Think about these men.
[00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:49.599]  These men are the scum of the earth.
[00:19:50.659 --> 00:19:59.761]  These men are criminals who want to hurt you and your family, who want to take your freedoms away, who want to arrest Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:00.821]  They would do it in a minute.
[00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:05.517]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:20:05.777 --> 00:20:12.560]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:26.367]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:20:26.687 --> 00:20:30.109]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:20:30.742 --> 00:20:31.662]  We're good to go.
[00:20:31.682 --> 00:20:31.922]  I think?
[00:21:01.687 --> 00:21:02.647]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.747 --> 00:21:07.510]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:15.493]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.753 --> 00:21:21.116]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:21.316 --> 00:21:28.319]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:29.019]  We're good to go.
[00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:53.451]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:57.293]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.633 --> 00:21:59.914]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:01.835]  Hello, folks.
[00:22:01.935 --> 00:22:02.876]  Alex Jones here.
[00:22:02.976 --> 00:22:07.078]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:07.218 --> 00:22:10.120]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:16.863]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:17.063 --> 00:22:20.066]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:20.287 --> 00:22:22.669]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:32.960]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:33.640]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.041]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:34.101 --> 00:22:35.641]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.

[00:24:07.745 --> 00:24:12.547]  Richard Salata will be joining us in about 35 minutes.
[00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:16.128]  He sent us a photo of the exact items he gave.
[00:24:16.208 --> 00:24:26.692]  Pocket constitutions, the writings of George Washington on a little booklet, police state three total enslavement, a film about Nazi death camps against the Nazis.
[00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.373]  So you give him a film against the Nazis?
[00:24:30.129 --> 00:24:38.054]  And the FBI and the BATF and foreign police come and they say, You gave the sheriff these documents.
[00:24:38.934 --> 00:24:40.715]  This is subversive.
[00:24:42.076 --> 00:24:43.677]  Again, I can't believe this.
[00:24:44.037 --> 00:24:50.201]  You give state police videos of a congressman in the floor of the Capitol!
[00:24:51.642 --> 00:24:55.384]  In the well of the house and these crazy... They're the crazy people!
[00:24:55.904 --> 00:24:56.665]  They're nuts!
[00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:02.568]  I mean, these people are out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:04.149]  They're totally brainwashed.
[00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:09.233]  These people are dumber than beagle dogs that you train.
[00:25:09.293 --> 00:25:23.824]  I mean, FEMA tells them George Washington's bad, and so they must arrest everyone that has... I have major law enforcement magazines, going back before 9-11, where it says, if you see someone that says, get us out of the U.N.,
[00:25:25.117 --> 00:25:25.938]  Sticker on their car.
[00:25:25.978 --> 00:25:27.018]  Go ahead and arrest them.
[00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:30.380]  And police chiefs back them up because they may be terrorists.
[00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:39.265]  I mean, there are major publications that tell police to go ahead and arrest people that are against the U.N.
[00:25:39.965 --> 00:25:43.107]  Hey, it's our First Amendment right, you freaks, you crooks.
[00:25:43.407 --> 00:25:44.608]  You are criminals.
[00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.170]  Let me tell you what's criminal.
[00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:51.752]  Let me tell you what's criminal.
[00:25:52.872 --> 00:25:53.853]  Let me get to the story in a minute.
[00:25:54.938 --> 00:26:09.987]  Going to middle schools and elementary schools, but mainly elementary schools in Michigan with federal grants, $200,000 plus each time they did it, and taking the kids off buses...
[00:26:11.642 --> 00:26:13.683]  And pouring fake blood on them.
[00:26:13.723 --> 00:26:14.924]  Yes, that's the full details.
[00:26:14.984 --> 00:26:16.785]  I have video of this at other drills here in Texas.
[00:26:17.345 --> 00:26:25.370]  And then running around with MP5 machine guns with blanks as the children cry, screaming, We are homeschoolers against public education.
[00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.350]  We have bombed you.
[00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.371]  We have killed you.
[00:26:28.672 --> 00:26:30.953]  And these cops are so stupid.
[00:26:31.253 --> 00:26:34.715]  They don't know that's the equivalent of a Soviet re-education brainwashing camp.
[00:26:35.675 --> 00:26:37.716]  I mean, that's what they did at re-education camps, folks.
[00:26:37.956 --> 00:26:39.137]  That is re-education.
[00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:44.320]  They're traumatizing hundreds of children in a pop, running around dumping red syrup on them!
[00:26:46.061 --> 00:26:49.523]  And the parents got mad, but not mad enough, like a bunch of cattle.
[00:26:49.803 --> 00:26:55.406]  I mean, are you going to let them dump fake blood on your 8-year-old and run around pointing MP5s at them?
[00:26:56.386 --> 00:27:01.109]  Well, we do this because of Columbine, and it's going to keep them safe next time.
[00:27:01.309 --> 00:27:03.230]  Hey, the government carried out Columbine.
[00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.871]  Go research it, you twits!
[00:27:05.655 --> 00:27:06.815]  You stupid criminals!
[00:27:12.037 --> 00:27:17.979]  Man raided by FBI, ATF, Canadian law enforcement after handing out subversive Alex Jones material.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.661]  Gun seller questioned on militia ownership of George Washington's speeches.
[00:27:23.561 --> 00:27:33.785]  A Dillon, Montana man had his home raided by 40 FBI, BATF, and Canadian law enforcement agents after handing out Alex Jones material to his local sheriff, which was subsequently deemed subversive.
[00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:36.871]  And then the sheriff called up and said, Can you come in?
[00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:39.093]  I'd like to talk to you a little bit more about that.
[00:27:39.974 --> 00:27:41.415]  He goes into the sheriff's office.
[00:27:41.475 --> 00:27:43.076]  Yes, sir, I've got more material for you.
[00:27:44.457 --> 00:27:50.702]  And they come in, and they arrest him, and they take him to his home, and they take everything.
[00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:53.945]  And they question him about the videos.
[00:27:55.046 --> 00:27:57.488]  This George Washington's bad, man.
[00:27:58.669 --> 00:28:05.734]  I bet these same police were out on their boats watching fireworks go off, going, I love America!
[00:28:06.514 --> 00:28:08.375]  After you slit its throat, you scum.
[00:28:08.415 --> 00:28:11.777]  You are such un-American trash.
[00:28:15.179 --> 00:28:25.645]  Richard Salata sells 80% completed firearms kits intended for purchasers, and they're sold in the biggest magazines in the country, who want to avoid having to register their weapons in government databases.
[00:28:25.665 --> 00:28:26.646]  You have to mail them yourself.
[00:28:27.259 --> 00:28:29.160]  The kits are completely legal in Montana.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:38.583]  Salada was politically active in disseminating the material of Alex Jones and others in the area, including handing out material to his local sheriff.
[00:28:39.464 --> 00:28:44.065]  On Monday morning, the sheriff called me and said, this is a quote, I've read your stuff.
[00:28:44.145 --> 00:28:45.746]  I would like to speak with you on Wednesday.
[00:28:45.766 --> 00:28:46.586]  Could you come in?
[00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:49.968]  He told GCN radio host Jack Blood yesterday.
[00:28:49.988 --> 00:28:52.869]  He's been on other shows that haven't been willing to say his name.
[00:28:53.349 --> 00:28:54.189]  Now he's saying his name.
[00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:56.430]  We already knew about the case from Gun Owners of America and others.
[00:28:58.645 --> 00:29:07.930]  Salata said that he thought the scheduled meeting on Wednesday was strange because there was an election on Tuesday and the sheriff wouldn't have known whether he'd still be an office or not.
[00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:15.053]  Wednesday morning, I got a phone call saying I lost the election and it's even more important that we have our meeting than it was before.
[00:29:16.153 --> 00:29:16.773]  What a creep.
[00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:23.756]  So, the individual collected material he had previously handed out to the sheriff and traveled to his office.
[00:29:24.937 --> 00:29:27.078]  When we get back, we'll tell you what happened to him in detail.
[00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:28.662]  Then he'll be joining us.
[00:29:30.623 --> 00:29:37.305]  But this is the type of... And again, the police on record will tell you.
[00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:38.846]  State police, sheriffs, feds.
[00:29:39.706 --> 00:29:40.186]  They'll tell you.
[00:29:40.206 --> 00:29:41.967]  They'll go, yeah, it's evil.
[00:29:42.007 --> 00:29:42.827]  We don't allow it.
[00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:46.228]  We don't allow videos about freedom.
[00:29:46.768 --> 00:29:47.468]  It's evil.
[00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.969]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:50.369]  We'll expose the scum.
[00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.810]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.791]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.803 --> 00:29:58.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.328 --> 00:30:09.712]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:10.073 --> 00:30:14.736]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:15.096 --> 00:30:22.661]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:29.945]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:30.165 --> 00:30:31.546]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:35.488]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[00:32:02.203 --> 00:32:03.043]  Come on, Bill.
[00:32:03.263 --> 00:32:08.427]  Two weeks ago you were riding the bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:10.269]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[00:32:10.369 --> 00:32:12.330]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:18.134]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:32:18.435 --> 00:32:24.679]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.221]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:27.501 --> 00:32:28.822]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:32:31.164 --> 00:32:31.624]  Whoa.
[00:32:31.964 --> 00:32:33.165]  What was that website again?
[00:32:33.245 --> 00:32:36.726]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:37.027 --> 00:32:38.147]  Now write this down, John.
[00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:42.589]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:32:42.729 --> 00:32:43.329]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:32:43.589 --> 00:32:44.810]  I'm going there right now.
[00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.870]  Check, please.
[00:32:47.651 --> 00:32:49.092]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:50.152]  Sure, John.
[00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:54.774]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:55.054 --> 00:32:56.735]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:32:56.915 --> 00:32:57.155]  Deal.
[00:33:11.215 --> 00:33:14.057]  Do not attempt to adjust your screen.
[00:33:14.477 --> 00:33:15.618]  We are in control.
[00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:16.958]  The outer limits.
[00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:19.940]  This music is fitting for what we're talking about.
[00:33:20.621 --> 00:33:21.941]  And I'm not going to make any more voices.
[00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:23.202]  I'm not going to get mad anymore.
[00:33:23.222 --> 00:33:30.506]  I'm actually having problems controlling myself to not yell and scream and call people a bunch of names.
[00:33:30.586 --> 00:33:32.267]  But that's a normal response.
[00:33:32.307 --> 00:33:34.909]  Do you understand this is not an isolated incident?
[00:33:36.027 --> 00:33:36.427]  We're good to go.
[00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:36.868]  We're good to go.
[00:33:57.805 --> 00:33:58.666]  None of it's illegal.
[00:33:58.986 --> 00:34:00.006]  You are illegal.
[00:34:00.066 --> 00:34:02.828]  You are scum trying to kill my country.
[00:34:03.428 --> 00:34:08.871]  Your president openly is setting up an American Union and killing my country!
[00:34:10.672 --> 00:34:13.614]  You want to turn America into the Soviet Union?
[00:34:13.634 --> 00:34:15.615]  Alright, I said I'm not going to get mad.
[00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:21.478]  Splattering fake blood all over little kids and scaring them.
[00:34:22.218 --> 00:34:23.679]  I'm so sick of you crooks.
[00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:29.068]  I wish we could take this country back and try every one of you and stick you in the prisons you want to put us in.
[00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:34.050]  I'm so sick of you idiot criminals.
[00:34:35.331 --> 00:34:37.271]  The incredible thing is I've met these police.
[00:34:37.331 --> 00:34:37.932]  I've talked to them.
[00:34:37.972 --> 00:34:38.872]  I've talked to them on the phone.
[00:34:38.912 --> 00:34:39.612]  I've confronted them.
[00:34:40.032 --> 00:34:42.113]  They actually think they're doing good.
[00:34:44.894 --> 00:34:46.795]  They actually think they're good people.
[00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:47.696]  Let me tell you something.
[00:34:47.736 --> 00:34:48.756]  You're not good.
[00:34:49.016 --> 00:34:50.997]  You are the death of America.
[00:34:51.197 --> 00:34:53.398]  You are the antichrist to this country.
[00:34:55.996 --> 00:34:58.178]  You are the antithesis of everything good.
[00:34:58.639 --> 00:35:06.767]  You are absolute, total scum of the earth, the scourge of the United States, the enemy of everything our veterans have fought and died for.
[00:35:06.947 --> 00:35:07.968]  You are trash.
[00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:12.252]  And I'm not afraid of you.
[00:35:12.993 --> 00:35:20.240]  You know what it's like to understand that my name is known by all these people, that they all think I'm a criminal because I expose you?
[00:35:21.485 --> 00:35:23.326]  I expose your gun confiscation.
[00:35:23.366 --> 00:35:28.410]  I go videotape Marines openly training to take our guns and admitting it's for America.
[00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:35.634]  I expose how they put water, how they put poison in our water and our air and all the bad things this government's doing.
[00:35:35.694 --> 00:35:39.637]  I expose the fact that you and your family are breathing DU just like I am.
[00:35:39.657 --> 00:35:43.699]  I expose the fact they're getting rid of our borders and our country.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:50.684]  I expose the fact that Bush has doubled the size of the BATF and is more anti-gun than Bill Clinton, according to NRA board member
[00:35:56.423 --> 00:35:58.404]  I'm so mad I can't even get to this article.
[00:36:02.165 --> 00:36:03.005]  I'm so angry.
[00:36:03.045 --> 00:36:04.345]  I'm so sick of you.
[00:36:04.525 --> 00:36:06.326]  I can't believe it's gotten this bad.
[00:36:06.786 --> 00:36:08.706]  You actually are arresting people.
[00:36:08.806 --> 00:36:14.008]  I have video of you arresting little women because they have pocket constitutions.
[00:36:14.228 --> 00:36:15.748]  You people are freaks!
[00:36:16.748 --> 00:36:17.769]  Look at yourselves!
[00:36:18.169 --> 00:36:21.249]  Do I have to explain to you that that's crazy?
[00:36:21.269 --> 00:36:23.110]  That you're crazy?
[00:36:25.842 --> 00:36:28.043]  That you shame all other good police?
[00:36:29.304 --> 00:36:52.038]  And I like to say it isn't all police or isn't most police, but I have to tell you, when it's feds and it's the political commissariat, there's certain classes of cops in the local police department, the intelligence agencies as they call them, and the SWAT teams and the intelligence units and the state police intelligence units and the FBI and FEMA and the BATF and Homeland Security and all of you, you're a bunch of freaks!
[00:36:53.686 --> 00:36:59.730]  You know what it's like to have family members of the Homeland Security Director write giant front page magazine cover hit pieces on me?
[00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:06.836]  You know what it's like to know their evil eyes are looking right at me right now, focusing on what I'm doing because we've been effective?
[00:37:10.358 --> 00:37:12.500]  Total and complete scum, all of you.
[00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:16.282]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:37:20.606 --> 00:37:20.686]  Ugh!
[00:37:23.968 --> 00:37:25.009]  Alright, I'm going to calm down.
[00:37:27.711 --> 00:37:28.912]  And I'm going to read this article.
[00:37:28.932 --> 00:37:31.114]  And we're not taking any calls this hour because I've got to go over this.
[00:37:31.134 --> 00:37:33.636]  I'm just going to start over and I'm going to read the whole article right now calmly.
[00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:37.479]  And it's Salada.
[00:37:37.539 --> 00:37:39.221]  I keep mispronouncing the poor man's name.
[00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:40.862]  He joins us in about 25 minutes.
[00:37:41.983 --> 00:37:44.986]  Man raided by FBI, ATF, Canadian law enforcement.
[00:37:45.006 --> 00:37:46.347]  Yes, foreign police were there.
[00:37:46.767 --> 00:37:49.089]  After handing out subversive Alex Jones material.
[00:37:49.565 --> 00:37:50.145]  That's their quote.
[00:37:50.605 --> 00:37:54.106]  Gun seller questioned on militia ownership of George Washington speeches.
[00:37:56.287 --> 00:38:06.250]  A demo Montana man had his home raided by 40 FBI, BATF, and Canadian law enforcement agents after handing out Alex Jones material to his local sheriff, which was subsequently deemed subversive.
[00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:16.372]  Richard Salata sells 80% completed firearms kits intended for purchasers who want to avoid having to register their weapons in government databases.
[00:38:16.452 --> 00:38:18.913]  And also a lot of people do it because it's a hobby.
[00:38:19.605 --> 00:38:20.546]  A lot of machinists like it.
[00:38:20.826 --> 00:38:25.469]  I've heard the guy interviewed many times on air before he got on another show, before he got rated.
[00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:29.292]  He's a big mainstream guy involved in the big Second Amendment organizations.
[00:38:30.112 --> 00:38:31.413]  There's hundreds of groups that sell these.
[00:38:32.154 --> 00:38:35.496]  The kids are completely legal in Montana, and I would add in the United States.
[00:38:36.377 --> 00:38:45.483]  Salada was politically active in disseminating the material of Alex Jones and others in his area, including Jewish Preservation Firearms ownership, I would add, including handing out material to his local sheriff.
[00:38:46.377 --> 00:38:49.859]  On Monday morning, the sheriff called me and said, I've read all your stuff.
[00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:52.121]  I would like to speak to you on Wednesday.
[00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:55.463]  Could you come in, Salata told GCN, radio host Jack Blood, yesterday.
[00:38:56.703 --> 00:39:06.129]  Salata said he thought the scheduled meeting on Wednesday was strange because there was an election on the Tuesday and the sheriff wouldn't know whether he would still be an officer or not.
[00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:15.195]  Wednesday morning, Salata says, I got a phone call saying, quote, I lost the election and it's even more important that we have our meeting than it was before.
[00:39:17.742 --> 00:39:23.065]  Salatam collected material he had previously handed out to the sheriff and traveled to his office.
[00:39:23.545 --> 00:39:27.867]  I walked into the room and there was way too many people in the sheriff's office, said Salatam.
[00:39:28.388 --> 00:39:39.633]  Salatam said he knew he was in trouble as he was introduced to the BATF and the FBI agents and handed a search warrant and a promise that his premises were going to be raided.
[00:39:41.934 --> 00:39:46.877]  I read the search warrant and lo and behold, there's no signed affidavit, said Salatam.
[00:39:47.682 --> 00:39:49.003]  But not under the Patriot Act.
[00:39:49.483 --> 00:39:57.988]  Salata told the sheriff the search warrant was therefore void, to which the FBI and BATF responded that the affidavit was secret and sealed by the court, meaning it's under the Patriot Act.
[00:39:58.809 --> 00:40:03.672]  Now they can make up the affidavit to match what they found if they want to, Salata said.
[00:40:03.692 --> 00:40:07.714]  And he said he was told by agents that they would carry out the search anyway.
[00:40:08.295 --> 00:40:15.059]  Salata was then escorted by an estimated 40 FBI, ATF, and Canadian law enforcement agents to his property, where they were met by more Canadians.
[00:40:15.965 --> 00:40:27.268]  Salata asked if he could call his wife so as to enable her and her two small children to leave the property before the SWAT team arrived but was refused on grounds that he was giving her a secret code to destroy evidence.
[00:40:28.048 --> 00:40:31.829]  However, the sheriff allowed the call to be made and the family was able to leave.
[00:40:32.169 --> 00:40:36.070]  At no point was Salata shown any identification by any of the agents.
[00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:44.592]  The cadre of goons, I don't call them agents, America killers, the cadre of America killers,
[00:40:45.313 --> 00:41:00.226]  The cadre of America killers, which they said agents, which now included Canadian ATF agents, then began the process of methodically cataloging and seizing Salata's possessions, bizarrely urinating on the exterior of the property, ignoring the two bathrooms located inside the building.
[00:41:01.047 --> 00:41:08.213]  Salata was told, without being shown any supporting evidence, that five of the pistols he had sold were used to commit murders in Canada.
[00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:12.997]  I said, guns don't kill people, people kill people.
[00:41:14.938 --> 00:41:24.904]  Following the raid, Salata was questioned on his relationship and his ownership of a citizen's rule book, speeches by George Washington, and Alex Jones' books and videos.
[00:41:24.944 --> 00:41:28.626]  He was asked why he read and listened to them and if he believed them.
[00:41:29.467 --> 00:41:34.310]  The agents asked Salata if he was in a militia or if he knew anyone that was.
[00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:40.974]  Salata had previously sent out material asking why Montana didn't have a state-organized militia when it was required by law.
[00:41:42.017 --> 00:41:51.404]  The agents then specifically asked Salata about specific individuals in the Freedom Movement, including JPFO, Aaron Zellman, director, author D.V.
[00:41:51.464 --> 00:41:54.546]  Kidd, and constitutional attorney Edward Vieira.
[00:41:55.427 --> 00:42:02.832]  The only way the agents could have known about Salata's interest in the work of Kidd and Vieira was if they had gained access to his emails.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:13.304]  After the three-hour interrogation, the agents took Salata's entire inventory of 80% finished frames, copied his computer hard drive, causing the computer to break down, and left.
[00:42:14.785 --> 00:42:23.028]  Tune in to the Alex Jones Show today for more details on the raid, and you can listen to an MP3 interview that we posted of Jack Blood interviewing him, and he'll be joining us.
[00:42:23.328 --> 00:42:26.570]  He contacted us a few weeks ago, but I wasn't going to have him on until he gave his full name and went public.
[00:42:27.236 --> 00:42:29.037]  People just can't believe this until you go public.
[00:42:29.337 --> 00:42:30.678]  JPFO knows all about it.
[00:42:30.698 --> 00:42:32.638]  They've been writing about it.
[00:42:32.959 --> 00:42:33.959]  They've confirmed the story.
[00:42:33.979 --> 00:42:35.420]  They were keeping quiet about the guy's name.
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.000]  Now he's gone public, so he's on the show.
[00:42:40.282 --> 00:42:42.003]  And we appreciate his courage in doing that.
[00:42:42.023 --> 00:42:42.803]  We need to support him.
[00:42:43.884 --> 00:42:44.084]  But...
[00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:47.211]  This is their mentality.
[00:42:47.271 --> 00:42:48.551]  This is their mindset.
[00:42:48.611 --> 00:42:50.152]  This is what they're into.
[00:42:50.932 --> 00:42:51.793]  This is what they do.
[00:42:51.833 --> 00:43:04.278]  And up on InfoWars.com right now, we have a photo that Mr. Salata took yesterday and has now sent to us of the exact items that he gave to the sheriff.
[00:43:05.279 --> 00:43:10.261]  And one of them is a booklet with George Washington on the front, and it's nothing but his speeches and his letters.
[00:43:11.303 --> 00:43:13.866]  And they were specifically interested in that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:13.907 --> 00:43:15.409]  George Washington.
[00:43:15.789 --> 00:43:20.836]  In case you don't know who he is, because they don't teach it in school anymore, he's the father of this country!
[00:43:22.978 --> 00:43:27.084]  He personally rode down the German mercenaries at Trenton.
[00:43:29.972 --> 00:43:32.074]  He was divinely protected by God.
[00:43:32.094 --> 00:43:35.836]  Every time he was on the battlefield, bullets would fly through his clothing, knock his hat off his head.
[00:43:35.856 --> 00:43:36.517]  He was fearless.
[00:43:36.857 --> 00:43:39.619]  He fought in hundreds of battles for this country!
[00:43:39.939 --> 00:43:44.022]  And you scumbag maggot pieces of absolute trash!
[00:43:44.362 --> 00:43:47.584]  Enemies of America don't like our founding father!
[00:43:47.765 --> 00:43:50.707]  You are absolute enemies of this country!
[00:43:50.887 --> 00:43:52.448]  You are criminal traitors!
[00:43:57.006 --> 00:44:02.568]  I do not have words strong enough to indict you for your crimes against this country.
[00:44:03.148 --> 00:44:05.129]  All of you that have engaged in this.
[00:44:05.789 --> 00:44:19.814]  All of you that are so weak-minded and so small-minded that you bought into this propaganda that the Constitution and people that stand up for their rights and our founding fathers and homeschoolers and gun owners and property rights activists are terrorists.
[00:44:20.095 --> 00:44:22.095]  I have documents, public documents.
[00:44:22.375 --> 00:44:23.796]  Can you imagine the secret ones?
[00:44:25.276 --> 00:44:27.298]  Where they list all of us as terrorists.
[00:44:27.478 --> 00:44:29.940]  You are the terrorists.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.462]  Your bosses carried out 9-11.
[00:44:33.743 --> 00:44:38.386]  Anybody who doubts all the evidence that 9-11 was an inside job, look at the evidence of the police state they've built after it.
[00:44:38.567 --> 00:44:39.848]  Look at how they were setting that beforehand.
[00:44:40.048 --> 00:44:45.072]  Look at how their political police, their commissariat, are against our Constitution.
[00:44:46.473 --> 00:44:50.576]  Federal judges over and over again, on record, have said, you can't bring the Constitution into my court.
[00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:51.657]  That's a dead letter.
[00:44:54.392 --> 00:44:57.716]  Police all the time get caught on tape saying there is no Constitution.
[00:44:59.318 --> 00:45:00.259]  We hired you.
[00:45:00.279 --> 00:45:01.620]  You work for us.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.163]  The Constitution is the rules the government follows.
[00:45:04.403 --> 00:45:05.785]  When you break it, you're a crook.
[00:45:06.045 --> 00:45:11.611]  It doesn't matter if you've got a bunch of criminal courts in place that protect you and allow you to engage in tyrannical behavior.
[00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:13.093]  You are still criminals.
[00:45:16.505 --> 00:45:28.268]  Now, I'm going to open the phones later today, and I'm specifically opening them for police and military and government individuals who either support the Constitution being destroyed and hate America, or for the people who are disgusted by this.
[00:45:28.468 --> 00:45:31.149]  I want to hear police get past their cowardice.
[00:45:31.169 --> 00:45:32.289]  You don't have to give us your name.
[00:45:32.649 --> 00:45:36.030]  I want to hear police, but you're so afraid another person will hear you in a squad car.
[00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.330]  I know there's hundreds of Austin police listening right now.
[00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:39.871]  I've been told by you to listen.
[00:45:39.891 --> 00:45:40.551]  I know a bunch of you.
[00:45:40.931 --> 00:45:41.971]  I want to hear you call in.
[00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:43.532]  I want to hear police out there.
[00:45:43.772 --> 00:45:56.216]  If you don't support this, what your brothers in arms are doing, I want to hear you call into this show right now and tell the American people that you stand with us and then we stand with you.
[00:45:59.677 --> 00:46:00.798]  We'll see if you'll call in.
[00:46:00.818 --> 00:46:00.878]  1-800-259-9231
[00:46:07.941 --> 00:46:14.246]  I remember this chief of police going down to Austin and lobbying against us, overthrowing the Patriot Act here locally, and the U.S.
[00:46:14.286 --> 00:46:15.347]  Attorney, the Assistant U.S.
[00:46:15.387 --> 00:46:16.288]  Attorney, and the rest of them.
[00:46:16.548 --> 00:46:21.052]  I mean, all we wanted was an affirmation that we follow the Constitution, and you won't even do that.
[00:46:24.554 --> 00:46:25.335]  You're shameful.
[00:46:25.375 --> 00:46:32.681]  You've been exercising authority too long, out of bounds, and you've turned into street thugs, a street gang working for global criminals.
[00:46:35.091 --> 00:46:41.116]  Now, I want to hear specifically from police, military, and others, former, current, whatever, who either are for this or against this.
[00:46:41.136 --> 00:46:41.837]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:42.077 --> 00:46:48.662]  Here it is in case you missed it.
[00:46:48.682 --> 00:46:50.204]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:51.905 --> 00:46:53.166]  Put your money where your mouth is.
[00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:58.390]  Either call in and give me your excuses for this type of behavior, or call in here and tell me you're against it.
[00:47:00.172 --> 00:47:01.353]  Give us your view on this.
[00:47:02.685 --> 00:47:03.806]  Maybe you think I'm out of line.
[00:47:03.826 --> 00:47:05.947]  Maybe you think I should treat this like it's normal.
[00:47:06.488 --> 00:47:08.929]  People being arrested for Ron Paul videos.
[00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.731]  Women being arrested for pocket constitutions.
[00:47:14.272 --> 00:47:16.054]  I've got videotape of it!
[00:47:17.194 --> 00:47:18.835]  I don't just have videotape of it happening.
[00:47:19.076 --> 00:47:20.376]  I have videotape of the training.
[00:47:20.597 --> 00:47:22.538]  Then we show you the aftermath of it.
[00:47:24.339 --> 00:47:28.281]  I want to talk to police who've been in these meetings in all 50 states and every county and city.
[00:47:28.301 --> 00:47:29.402]  I know they've gone on in Austin.
[00:47:29.622 --> 00:47:30.463]  Right here where I sit.
[00:47:31.283 --> 00:47:32.144]  We've got video of it.
[00:47:34.813 --> 00:47:40.735]  I mean, what are you thinking when you're in a big classroom or an auditorium and there's federal goons up there saying George Washington's bad?
[00:47:40.755 --> 00:47:49.317]  And what's happened to other police if they hear this and then they go out and they believe it and they enforce it against people when it's not a law?
[00:47:52.498 --> 00:47:53.379]  You're crazy!
[00:47:55.919 --> 00:47:56.960]  Have any police called in?
[00:48:01.101 --> 00:48:04.462]  So here's a show where we can load the phone lines and keep them jammed anytime we want.
[00:48:06.744 --> 00:48:12.109]  Well, our phone system takes 20 calls, and there's no police calling in right now.
[00:48:12.169 --> 00:48:16.413]  There's no military calling in right now to decry this and to say that they're against this.
[00:48:21.117 --> 00:48:25.521]  Because even those of you out there, a lot of you out there that are against what's happening, you're still so afraid.
[00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:31.287]  You've lived in cowardice so long that you dare not stick your head up, even when nobody will know who you are.
[00:48:32.026 --> 00:48:34.248]  And say that you'll protect America.
[00:48:34.468 --> 00:48:36.830]  That you'll defend what the 4th of July stood for.
[00:48:38.631 --> 00:48:39.632]  What it stands for.
[00:48:44.576 --> 00:48:45.577]  There are so many cases.
[00:48:45.617 --> 00:48:51.201]  There are so many cases of this now where they arrest people for pocket constitutions and George Washington's writings and my videos.
[00:48:51.241 --> 00:48:52.842]  I don't even cover it 10% of the time now.
[00:48:53.543 --> 00:48:54.504]  It just floods in.
[00:48:55.585 --> 00:48:57.666]  Most of the time I can't completely confirm it so I don't cover it.
[00:48:57.686 --> 00:48:59.508]  But there are dozens of times where I have confirmed it.
[00:48:59.948 --> 00:49:00.949]  Where it's in newspapers.
[00:49:02.426 --> 00:49:04.167]  More major organizations report on it.
[00:49:05.808 --> 00:49:14.254]  And it's part and parcel of people being detained for wearing peace t-shirts or being arrested or for reading a newspaper the police don't like the headlines on.
[00:49:15.535 --> 00:49:16.075]  It's sick.
[00:49:16.635 --> 00:49:19.457]  Imagine, land of the free, home of the brave, turned into this.
[00:49:19.937 --> 00:49:21.138]  Turned into this!
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.002]  And the government's so criminal that they've taught the police and they've taught...
[00:49:28.064 --> 00:49:35.630]  The FBI, everybody about Alex Jones and Ron Paul and other evil people of the past, like George Washington.
[00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.911]  Well, I'm in good company then.
[00:49:37.192 --> 00:49:37.832]  I'm in company.
[00:49:37.872 --> 00:49:38.933]  The tower's above me.
[00:49:38.973 --> 00:49:54.626]  I haven't been out on a hundred-plus battlefields, outnumbered six, seven to one, with bullets flying through my... with case shot, with cartridge grape flying through my hat.
[00:49:56.289 --> 00:49:58.391]  I haven't written down foreign mercenaries.
[00:49:58.471 --> 00:50:01.594]  I haven't done anything but stood up and tried to tell the truth.
[00:50:02.395 --> 00:50:05.277]  And you think about what they've done to George Washington.
[00:50:05.398 --> 00:50:19.711]  You told George Washington that in 230 years, after he started his war against the Redcoats, that his name would be that of a terrorist and that of a criminal and that of someone who's bad.
[00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:20.672]  He would laugh at you.
[00:50:20.892 --> 00:50:21.893]  He wouldn't believe you.
[00:50:22.654 --> 00:50:25.957]  Or maybe he would because he grew up in it and he saw what the British did.
[00:50:26.177 --> 00:50:28.959]  And he was a loyal British subject until it got so out of control.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.621]  He served the Queen.
[00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:31.862]  He served the King.
[00:50:32.422 --> 00:50:37.086]  He fought for a decade on the front lines of the Indian Wars with his Virginia Blues.
[00:50:40.569 --> 00:50:42.091]  So maybe George Washington would know.
[00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:44.633]  Maybe he would understand because he'd already lived through it.
[00:50:48.653 --> 00:50:49.994]  You are the terrorist.
[00:50:50.154 --> 00:50:59.618]  When you shoot your mouth off and arrest people for having a book with the writings of George Washington, you are a terrorist.
[00:50:59.638 --> 00:51:00.699]  You are a terrorist.
[00:51:02.651 --> 00:51:10.035]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.295 --> 00:51:15.038]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.258 --> 00:51:20.901]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:25.663]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.884 --> 00:51:33.047]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:33.067 --> 00:51:37.610]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:40.271]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.511 --> 00:51:47.215]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.515 --> 00:51:47.775]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:03.288 --> 00:52:14.552]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:52:14.772 --> 00:52:21.214]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:52:21.474 --> 00:52:22.736]  To below detectable levels.
[00:52:23.036 --> 00:52:26.961]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:27.181 --> 00:52:33.730]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:39.417]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:39.657 --> 00:52:46.580]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.461]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:02.913 --> 00:54:08.074]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.734 --> 00:54:11.015]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:19.548 --> 00:54:30.877]  Well, I've got loaded phone lines of veterans, but police listening all over the country from Kansas City to Austin, Texas to upstate New York to Southern California.
[00:54:32.338 --> 00:54:34.720]  And so I take from this that you support it.
[00:54:35.261 --> 00:54:35.781]  You like it.
[00:54:36.382 --> 00:54:37.683]  You don't like George Washington.
[00:54:38.884 --> 00:54:40.345]  Seriously, you don't like Ron Paul.
[00:54:40.665 --> 00:54:45.369]  Or even if you do dislike Ron Paul, I guess you think it's legal?
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:53.244]  And lawful to arrest people for Ron Paul speeches in the well of the House.
[00:54:53.324 --> 00:54:59.347]  Imagine putting a videotape in your VCR, and it's a congressman giving a speech in the Capitol, and you think it's illegal.
[00:55:00.808 --> 00:55:08.332]  You think you're going to go put somebody in jail for six years without their family behind bars eating horrible food.
[00:55:09.389 --> 00:55:15.852]  With their businesses being destroyed, you sleep good, ruining lives, trying to put people behind bars.
[00:55:15.892 --> 00:55:17.273]  That's the worst kind of crime.
[00:55:17.293 --> 00:55:31.460]  Before I go to Rhonda and Kirk and Chris and others and then our guest, that this all happened to, the latest person to go through the ringer for his political beliefs, get my new film Terror Storm.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.862]  We have limited copies of the Symposium version, and the official one will come out in about a month.
[00:55:35.882 --> 00:55:36.763]  We're behind on it.
[00:55:37.816 --> 00:55:38.657]  That's why I'm not waiting.
[00:55:38.957 --> 00:55:40.239]  It'll just have 30 minutes of extras.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.563]  Get your copy of Terror Storm now because we can't wait.
[00:55:43.663 --> 00:55:44.424]  Make copies of it.
[00:55:44.444 --> 00:55:45.145]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:55:45.205 --> 00:55:46.326]  It's the best film I've ever made.
[00:55:46.827 --> 00:55:47.387]  Best music.
[00:55:47.427 --> 00:55:48.268]  Best visuals.
[00:55:48.328 --> 00:55:48.929]  Best graphics.
[00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:50.511]  Animations.
[00:55:51.638 --> 00:55:53.039]  The globalists carrying out 9-11.
[00:55:53.059 --> 00:55:54.259]  The globalists carrying out the London bombing.
[00:55:54.279 --> 00:55:55.840]  The globalists carrying out the Madrid bombing.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:59.382]  The globalists' own documents carrying out a bunch of other bombings and terrorist attacks.
[00:55:59.402 --> 00:56:00.662]  Go to Infowars.com.
[00:56:01.123 --> 00:56:03.844]  Get your copy of Terror Storm right now and make thousands of copies.
[00:56:04.244 --> 00:56:06.605]  Most police that we've run into actually thank you for these.
[00:56:07.065 --> 00:56:08.786]  Most people in government actually are waking up.
[00:56:08.826 --> 00:56:12.428]  But there's this hardcore core of political commissariat they send out.
[00:56:13.288 --> 00:56:16.030]  We've got to expose them before they get full control.
[00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:18.731]  Because they would love to arrest me.
[00:56:18.751 --> 00:56:19.811]  They'd love to kill me, folks.
[00:56:19.851 --> 00:56:20.912]  They'd love to kill all of us.
[00:56:21.556 --> 00:56:22.218]  They're into this.
[00:56:22.238 --> 00:56:23.201]  They're into power.
[00:56:23.241 --> 00:56:23.923]  They're criminals.
[00:56:24.785 --> 00:56:26.490]  Get Terror Storm today.
[00:56:26.671 --> 00:56:28.055]  Make copies of the DVD.
[00:56:28.945 --> 00:56:30.205]  It's right under two hours long.
[00:56:30.265 --> 00:56:31.326]  It is my best work yet.
[00:56:31.746 --> 00:56:33.807]  We have blood, sweat, and tears to make this film.
[00:56:34.187 --> 00:56:36.968]  Call toll-free to get Terror Storm and a bunch of other videos while you're at it.
[00:56:36.988 --> 00:56:40.369]  They can tell you all about the specials, different titles, what they cover.
[00:56:40.389 --> 00:56:56.315]  1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or InfoWars.com off the secure online shopping target, your hard copy, or see it online now in high bandwidth or low bandwidth for members at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:57:00.418 --> 00:57:01.759]  Rhonda in Missouri.
[00:57:01.859 --> 00:57:04.460]  Rhonda, I guess you said you're former military.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:05.401]  You want to comment on this.
[00:57:06.181 --> 00:57:06.961]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:57:07.782 --> 00:57:10.223]  Former military, law enforcement, 14 years.
[00:57:11.023 --> 00:57:13.944]  I got out because I just couldn't take it anymore.
[00:57:14.425 --> 00:57:15.305]  I'm not for this.
[00:57:16.045 --> 00:57:17.046]  I'm not for what's going on.
[00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:17.626]  You know that.
[00:57:17.706 --> 00:57:19.047]  I've got all your videos.
[00:57:19.107 --> 00:57:26.350]  As a matter of fact, I went up to the court the other day, and I wore my tyranny response team T-shirt right in front of the judge and everybody in the courtroom.
[00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:27.063]  I think.
[00:57:27.083 --> 00:57:27.523]  I think.
[00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:50.206]  You've seen the video of this happening.
[00:57:50.386 --> 00:57:52.107]  I know, I feel like I'm making this up.
[00:57:52.187 --> 00:57:53.789]  It's so weird, I can't believe it.
[00:57:54.269 --> 00:57:58.753]  What do you think goes through these feds' heads when they're doing this?
[00:57:59.213 --> 00:58:04.958]  I think they must not be connected to their heart, to their Heavenly Father, to our Heavenly Father.
[00:58:05.338 --> 00:58:12.504]  The dumb and down that's gone over over the years, to the schools, the training camps that we send our children to.
[00:58:14.005 --> 00:58:15.306]  What got me into this most was
[00:58:16.323 --> 00:58:23.005]  Thank you for waking me up after 9-11 because I prayed to hear the truth and our Heavenly Father sent me to your station.
[00:58:24.005 --> 00:58:29.907]  And I'm going to do everything I can as long as I draw breath to make sure that this don't go down the way they want it to go down.
[00:58:29.967 --> 00:58:34.428]  And glory be to our Heavenly Father because He's going to bring us out of it if we put our faith in Him.
[00:58:34.768 --> 00:58:35.228]  Absolutely.
[00:58:35.248 --> 00:58:36.109]  Anything else, Rhonda?
[00:58:36.489 --> 00:58:37.409]  No, thank you, Alex.
[00:58:37.909 --> 00:58:39.170]  And bless you.
[00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:40.150]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:40.750]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.903 --> 00:58:42.163]  Big Brother.
[00:58:42.183 --> 00:58:42.704]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:01.508 --> 00:59:03.750]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.511 --> 00:59:05.412]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.072 --> 00:59:09.796]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:14.321]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.889 --> 00:59:22.632]  Well, a gun manufacturer was raided and arrested, or detained, and then had all his goods seized.
[00:59:22.672 --> 00:59:28.534]  He'll be joining us after giving him the writings of George Washington, my videos, JPFO material.
[00:59:28.554 --> 00:59:29.334]  He'll be joining us.
[00:59:29.895 --> 00:59:37.218]  And I put the challenge out to police out there that don't agree with all the FBI and local training field manuals that say founding fathers are terrorists.
[00:59:37.558 --> 00:59:41.681]  Gun owners are terrorists, homeschoolers are terrorists, property rights activists are terrorists.
[00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:44.222]  We have copies of them with phone numbers all posted on the website.
[00:59:44.502 --> 00:59:47.244]  You can call the offices that have these and these are real folks.
[00:59:47.764 --> 00:59:49.925]  And they're out grabbing people for this right now.
[00:59:49.985 --> 00:59:50.686]  They think it's normal.
[00:59:51.486 --> 00:59:53.407]  George is, I guess, a retired police officer.
[00:59:53.447 --> 00:59:54.428]  He's calling from New Mexico.
[00:59:54.448 --> 00:59:56.189]  Then we'll go to Kirk and Chris and others.
[00:59:56.229 --> 00:59:59.651]  I'm challenging police to call in and either say they're for this or they're against it.
[01:00:00.232 --> 01:00:00.912]  Go ahead, George.
[01:00:01.552 --> 01:00:02.253]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:00:02.293 --> 01:00:02.933]  How was your day?
[01:00:03.754 --> 01:00:05.935]  I got a little hot last hour, but we should get angry.
[01:00:06.491 --> 01:00:07.391]  No, no, that's good.
[01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:17.373]  I've been watching all of this for 30 years, and it came to mind when you spoke about George Washington and his divine covering and being absolutely shot through the clothes.
[01:00:18.613 --> 01:00:25.155]  I've had that experience, looked in a muzzle flash and went home in a black t-shirt, and I usually took my clothes off before I went in the house.
[01:00:26.175 --> 01:00:28.495]  And my wife saw the shirt.
[01:00:28.936 --> 01:00:30.456]  Oh, honey, that's battery acid.
[01:00:31.196 --> 01:00:32.736]  She goes through the front and the back.
[01:00:33.516 --> 01:00:36.077]  And I've spoken to a few guys that have had this happen.
[01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:40.232]  My police career began... I am George Lee Harris, Jr.
[01:00:40.612 --> 01:00:44.935]  My social security number is 547... Listen, listen, let's not do that, sir.
[01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.756]  I mean, I'm glad you're out in the open Santa Yarda.
[01:00:46.796 --> 01:00:47.137]  Go ahead.
[01:00:47.537 --> 01:00:49.938]  Good deal, Alex.
[01:00:50.078 --> 01:00:51.959]  In 1971, I was in high school.
[01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.340]  The Vietnam War was rolling.
[01:00:53.821 --> 01:00:55.522]  And you either join or get drafted.
[01:00:56.362 --> 01:01:05.548]  And we were being called, the sons of attorneys, doctors, physicians, dentists, architects, to become new police officers.
[01:01:06.212 --> 01:01:13.918]  It would be sharp and run this thing according to the rules and the documents and, you know, not be psychobabble trash.
[01:01:13.938 --> 01:01:23.065]  It would be out there being psychologically appropriate and consoling, but also enforcing to the letter of the law with proper judgment.
[01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:35.335]  The police chief, the 22 of us were going to come in under, Benton Minor, professor, Fullerton University in California, his son, Ron, and myself and so many others.
[01:01:36.041 --> 01:01:39.422]  We were gently nudged out.
[01:01:39.482 --> 01:01:42.203]  The police chief at the time was Harold Bastrop.
[01:01:42.743 --> 01:01:43.663]  He was a patrolman.
[01:01:43.683 --> 01:01:45.624]  He was an investigator.
[01:01:46.384 --> 01:01:48.184]  And then he became chief of police.
[01:01:48.825 --> 01:01:51.105]  He had less than two years to go to a retirement.
[01:01:51.545 --> 01:01:55.587]  He got told, and he told us, you boys are not coming in.
[01:01:56.347 --> 01:01:57.967]  We're going to run this our way.
[01:01:58.267 --> 01:01:59.628]  I started watching it then.
[01:01:59.648 --> 01:02:02.969]  And I was made aware by my father, who was an attorney,
[01:02:04.585 --> 01:02:08.468]  But there was a Senate bill around that same time, kind of amazing.
[01:02:08.508 --> 01:02:16.875]  There was an SR-71 plane, but the same day on the LA Times, this SB-71 warrantless searches.
[01:02:17.816 --> 01:02:21.038]  Your neighbor could square out a complaint, and they could just enter your home.
[01:02:21.118 --> 01:02:22.880]  This has been working for some time.
[01:02:23.921 --> 01:02:29.085]  The greatest concern I've had is that people don't understand about the chips.
[01:02:29.785 --> 01:02:31.527]  I come from a very special family.
[01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:34.753]  If there were no elections, I would be a Scottish prince.
[01:02:35.714 --> 01:02:37.735]  My mother's maiden name was White Man.
[01:02:38.356 --> 01:02:42.079]  We are Scottish Rite Masons by blood in the Illuminati.
[01:02:42.199 --> 01:02:48.764]  We have a lot of information, but you can be a brownie and maybe buy cookies and not be a brownie, if this all makes sense.
[01:02:49.464 --> 01:02:52.887]  They've tolerated me for years in the family.
[01:02:52.907 --> 01:02:54.948]  I guess they can't kill me.
[01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:58.651]  I tell them scripturally, whoever jails me must be jailed.
[01:02:59.092 --> 01:03:00.713]  Whoever kills me must be killed.
[01:03:01.556 --> 01:03:09.462]  My sister was involved with her company, Johnson & Johnson, before 1985 with developing the RFID chips.
[01:03:10.523 --> 01:03:13.185]  And I told her about a young friend of mine who was 13.
[01:03:13.305 --> 01:03:16.307]  Listen, we're out of time.
[01:03:16.347 --> 01:03:19.069]  You need to write all this up and send it to me.
[01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:19.669]  It's very interesting.
[01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:20.610]  We've got our guests coming on.
[01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:26.475]  Father in heaven, stand with Alex Jones, his family, and those angels that protect him and myself.
[01:03:26.955 --> 01:03:28.296]  I have come off the soapbox.
[01:03:28.846 --> 01:03:31.767]  I've opened my mouth, and they can check to check up their ass.
[01:03:32.168 --> 01:03:32.828]  Have a nice day.
[01:03:32.848 --> 01:03:34.089]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:35.529]  Let's all kind of be careful.
[01:03:35.549 --> 01:03:36.450]  We have a lot of children listening.
[01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:37.690]  Let's watch even the mild stuff.
[01:03:38.151 --> 01:03:39.571]  All right, we've got our guest coming up.
[01:03:41.432 --> 01:03:46.434]  We'll get it right from the horse's mouth exactly what happened to him on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:46.875 --> 01:03:47.635]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:03:47.655 --> 01:03:49.496]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:03:53.849 --> 01:03:55.391]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:58.634]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.754 --> 01:04:02.657]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.697 --> 01:04:06.962]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:04:07.282 --> 01:04:11.065]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:11.145 --> 01:04:13.067]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.207 --> 01:04:16.531]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.571 --> 01:04:17.632]  The medical bills.
[01:04:19.252 --> 01:04:21.253]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.413 --> 01:04:24.454]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.634 --> 01:04:27.535]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.975 --> 01:04:34.097]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:35.157]  We're good to go.
[01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:55.874]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.214 --> 01:04:58.996]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.276 --> 01:05:03.419]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.660]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:09.564]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.049 --> 01:05:12.170]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:27.353]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.413 --> 01:05:34.475]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:34.835 --> 01:05:39.238]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:05:39.658 --> 01:05:43.700]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.742]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:47.022 --> 01:05:50.984]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:52.885 --> 01:05:56.948]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:05:57.148 --> 01:06:00.570]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:04.132]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.703]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:06:07.723 --> 01:06:13.208]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:06:13.228 --> 01:06:22.857]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:06:22.997 --> 01:06:24.338]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:06:24.378 --> 01:06:29.783]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.703]  If you'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:06:34.723 --> 01:06:36.164]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:06:36.324 --> 01:06:40.186]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:06:40.206 --> 01:06:41.066]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:56.640]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.083]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:06.749]  Imagine you're an American citizen, upstanding record, a criminal record.
[01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:10.352]  You own a successful gun kit company, totally legal.
[01:07:13.183 --> 01:07:16.686]  You visit your Montana, Dillon, Montana sheriff.
[01:07:17.007 --> 01:07:19.409]  You give him an Alex Jones video.
[01:07:19.889 --> 01:07:21.771]  You give him some JPFO material.
[01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:31.059]  You give him a little booklet, Pocket Constitution, the very same one that we put in every order where folks buy our videos or books.
[01:07:32.821 --> 01:07:34.162]  And several other things.
[01:07:34.282 --> 01:07:38.626]  In fact, we have a photo that Mr. Salata sent us of the exact items that
[01:07:39.616 --> 01:07:42.977]  That he gave the sheriff, and then the sheriff calls and says, I want you to come in.
[01:07:42.997 --> 01:07:44.698]  I want to talk to you about this.
[01:07:44.718 --> 01:08:03.745]  And when you get there, there's federal police, BATF and FBI, and Canadian police, and they take you to your home, and they basically break his computer, copying the hard drive, and take his gun kits, and then question him about these materials, and quote, does he believe them?
[01:08:04.392 --> 01:08:10.794]  This is part of a long train of these abuses we've seen with Kelly Rushing and many, many others on the record in newspapers.
[01:08:10.834 --> 01:08:28.080]  I mean, this is reported on where they charged Kelly Rushing in Kentucky, Lyon County, Kentucky, with threatening police by giving him a Ron Paul video with a Ron Paul speech neocon in the floor of the house in the Capitol and one of my films or two of my films on the same tape.
[01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:33.042]  This is the mentality a jury found him not guilty of this being a threat to the police.
[01:08:34.168 --> 01:08:43.297]  And we have federally written training manuals from Virginia, Texas, Arizona, and other states posted with this article on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:43.677 --> 01:08:56.370]  Go to InfoWars.com, get the article, man rated by FBI, ATF, Canadian law enforcement after handing out subversive Alex Jones material, gun seller question on militia ownership of George Washington, speeches, among other things.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:57.800]  Get this article.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.041]  It has the photo of the materials he gave the sheriff.
[01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:06.923]  It has the training flyers and manuals from the states where this is being taught.
[01:09:08.524 --> 01:09:19.107]  In my film, The Road to Tyranny, I have FEMA on video in Kansas City telling a group of firefighters and police that the Founding Fathers are terrorists and enemies of the government and Christians are terrorists.
[01:09:19.167 --> 01:09:21.527]  We don't just have their training manuals, we have them on video.
[01:09:22.048 --> 01:09:23.128]  So I'm just recapping that.
[01:09:24.017 --> 01:09:26.739]  Richard Salata joins us now.
[01:09:26.759 --> 01:09:30.561]  And a lot of you have heard about this case the last month, but he wasn't using his full name.
[01:09:30.941 --> 01:09:32.322]  Gun Owners of America wasn't.
[01:09:32.742 --> 01:09:36.104]  And, of course, JPFO, Jews Preservation and Firearms Ownership, wasn't.
[01:09:36.444 --> 01:09:37.925]  Now he's decided to go public.
[01:09:38.585 --> 01:09:40.446]  And, Richard Salata, thank you for joining us.
[01:09:40.486 --> 01:09:41.287]  Thank you for your courage.
[01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:42.687]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:42.707 --> 01:09:43.768]  Thank you for having me on.
[01:09:44.088 --> 01:09:49.371]  Tell us why you decided to go public, and then let's run through the story and what happened, and then where we go from here.
[01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:57.168]  Well, seeing that I haven't been charged with anything or arrested with anything, now it's time to get my stuff back.
[01:09:57.848 --> 01:10:09.156]  So I need to kind of get the information out on what they're doing and, you know, work in this and get all this stuff taken care of.
[01:10:09.176 --> 01:10:13.499]  What they've done is they've shut down a whole industry by this raid.
[01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:19.624]  Everybody who makes the products that I make, all my competitors, have all pulled all their stuff off the shelf.
[01:10:20.779 --> 01:10:29.707]  So what they've done is actually gotten rid of a whole industry without any charges or any laws.
[01:10:29.947 --> 01:10:36.393]  Bob Barr was on with us a few months ago, NRA board member, conservative former member of Congress, former CIA officer.
[01:10:37.293 --> 01:10:40.915]  And he said George Bush has been more anti-gun than Bill Clinton.
[01:10:40.955 --> 01:10:53.644]  He just said without laws, simply with regulations, they are attacking gun dealers, gun manufacturers, importers, and increasing the numbers of raids, again doubling the funding, now over doubling it.
[01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:57.106]  But again, the average gun owner thinks everything's fine.
[01:10:58.067 --> 01:10:58.227]  Right.
[01:10:59.315 --> 01:10:59.475]  Yep.
[01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.356]  Let's go back to what happened.
[01:11:01.376 --> 01:11:03.656]  Let's spend some time on this, Richard Salata.
[01:11:04.077 --> 01:11:07.318]  Tell us where you live locally, what you did, how you contacted the sheriff.
[01:11:07.578 --> 01:11:11.259]  Tell us about that first meeting, and then he called you later saying, please come back in.
[01:11:11.299 --> 01:11:12.279]  Give us a blow-by-blow.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.461]  Okay, we're in Dillon, Montana, the southwest corner.
[01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:22.743]  We've been here for two years now because we had a little problem in New Hampshire zoning.
[01:11:22.783 --> 01:11:26.644]  They didn't like me living and working in the same building.
[01:11:27.525 --> 01:11:28.665]  Not enough taxes, you know.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.602]  You have two pieces of property to get more from you.
[01:11:32.523 --> 01:11:34.805]  But I come here to Dylan.
[01:11:35.926 --> 01:11:42.233]  I think the sheriff, which his name is Briggs, I think he's a decent sheriff.
[01:11:42.273 --> 01:11:45.556]  I think he's just been kind of persuaded to do things.
[01:11:47.274 --> 01:11:54.277]  You guys always say that, and then they're going to do something, I predict they'll do something even worse to you, and then you won't be whistling that tune.
[01:11:54.317 --> 01:11:55.557]  See how nice we are?
[01:11:56.077 --> 01:12:00.139]  See how this man has been abused, and he's still making excuses for these creatures.
[01:12:00.199 --> 01:12:00.599]  Go ahead.
[01:12:01.539 --> 01:12:02.940]  Okay.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.760]  I've given him some stuff in the past.
[01:12:05.901 --> 01:12:14.263]  I've talked with him a bit, and I wanted to talk to him more on the state militias, which is what Dr. Edwin Vieira was writing about.
[01:12:14.283 --> 01:12:15.524]  And
[01:12:16.616 --> 01:12:26.143]  That was kind of the catalyst of the phone call because he had gotten the information and he said he wanted to review it with me and he had some time on Wednesday.
[01:12:26.964 --> 01:12:28.004]  And this was Monday morning.
[01:12:28.985 --> 01:12:33.428]  And specifically you gave him what is in that photograph posted on the website right now.
[01:12:34.749 --> 01:12:39.273]  That was stuff I was bringing with me on the Monday meeting.
[01:12:39.293 --> 01:12:41.715]  I gave him the Wednesday meeting.
[01:12:42.495 --> 01:12:44.837]  I had given him some of your other information
[01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:48.843]  Because I have all your videos and stuff.
[01:12:48.863 --> 01:12:55.206]  So this was just added stuff that I was going to give him.
[01:12:56.167 --> 01:13:05.592]  So I go to... Well, I figured Monday when he called and said he wanted a meeting on Wednesday, which I thought was strange because, of course, the next day is the election.
[01:13:06.352 --> 01:13:08.994]  And if he loses, he doesn't need this material.
[01:13:10.034 --> 01:13:11.095]  So I thought it was kind of strange.
[01:13:11.135 --> 01:13:11.955]  Maybe he thought he was...
[01:13:14.504 --> 01:13:15.745]  Shoo-in-win or something.
[01:13:17.386 --> 01:13:41.305]  So when he calls Wednesday morning and leaves a message on my answering machine, because he called before I get up, and said that it's even more important that we have this meeting now, I sent out a letter and an email, and Jack Blood got it, and so did everybody else on my email list, that if they didn't hear from me by noontime, assume I'm in jail, and then start calling everybody.
[01:13:42.921 --> 01:13:44.882]  And, of course, they didn't hear from me by noontime.
[01:13:47.403 --> 01:13:52.805]  And so that's kind of where it gets up to, and then I don't know how long you want to go through the timeline.
[01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:56.327]  Yeah, when you got there, I mean, describe walking in what you saw.
[01:13:57.447 --> 01:13:58.848]  Well, we went into the sheriff's office.
[01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:03.550]  It's actually a very small office, and the sheriff and the undersheriff are in there.
[01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:11.333]  And when I go in, there's the sheriff, the undersheriff, a lady who was the ATF agent, and a gentleman who was
[01:14:12.199 --> 01:14:13.160]  The FBI agent.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:23.927]  And then they proceeded to hand me the warrant, which of course I read it, and there is no signed affidavit with it, and I questioned that.
[01:14:24.107 --> 01:14:26.008]  What did they say to you when they handed it to you?
[01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:37.096]  They had a search warrant to go through my place, and they were going to search me, my vehicle, and my building.
[01:14:39.672 --> 01:14:42.273]  So you read over it and it's not a sign sworn?
[01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:43.534]  Right.
[01:14:43.994 --> 01:14:48.095]  There's no affidavit with it and they said it's sealed in secret and that I would never know about it.
[01:14:49.976 --> 01:15:00.139]  And again, as you recounted in the other article you were reading, that the sheriff said it was a valid warrant and he was going to allow them to proceed.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:02.960]  And they did.
[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.181]  So that's up to that point.
[01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:07.282]  Then we come back to
[01:15:09.892 --> 01:15:19.758]  Back to my place, they give me a babysitter for the next eight hours or so, and watch them go through all my stuff.
[01:15:19.778 --> 01:15:23.120]  I have a really good neighbor that I have to tell you about.
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.442]  He was out there... We're going to get to that, but I want to get to that in just a little while.
[01:15:27.943 --> 01:15:31.865]  Specifically, by quote, babysitter, you get to the house, how many agents are there?
[01:15:31.885 --> 01:15:32.946]  Tell us about the Canadians.
[01:15:35.452 --> 01:15:48.257]  Judging from the number of vehicles and four people to a vehicle and the over-the-head helicopter and the two snipers up on the hill in my backyard, I assume there's about 40 with the SWAT team.
[01:15:48.317 --> 01:15:56.099]  I didn't actually see the physical SWAT team with the guys in their black ninjas and ski masks because I got here after that part.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.761]  They held me away until they cleared the facility.
[01:16:01.801 --> 01:16:03.122]  Because you're an evil gunmaker.
[01:16:03.162 --> 01:16:03.822]  Please continue.
[01:16:04.699 --> 01:16:04.979]  Right.
[01:16:08.101 --> 01:16:27.170]  So the Canadians come in and they proceed to tell me that supposedly or allegedly there were five murders committed in Canada and my 80% frames were what these people built these guns on and actually killed people with them.
[01:16:27.691 --> 01:16:34.334]  And they wanted to show me how terrible and awful things that my products were doing to people.
[01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:45.878]  And I can guarantee you that one of those stories, those five stories they wanted to tell me, was about a little child, probably exactly the same age as one of mine.
[01:16:47.359 --> 01:16:51.882]  So I, again, quoted it, and I said, you know, guns kill people, people don't kill people.
[01:16:51.942 --> 01:16:56.245]  I can go to any gun store, I mean, any gun show, purchase a firearm...
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.221]  Go kill someone.
[01:16:59.241 --> 01:17:05.464]  They always have their emotional salve for what they're doing, but specifically, what did they do for the hours while they searched your business?
[01:17:07.325 --> 01:17:07.805]  What did they do to you?
[01:17:07.825 --> 01:17:08.486]  Where did they put you?
[01:17:09.446 --> 01:17:16.009]  I was in my kitchen, sitting at the kitchen table with two agents guarding me.
[01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:17.290]  I was not under arrest.
[01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:21.712]  I could actually leave at any point in time, but I figured I would stay there and
[01:17:22.321 --> 01:17:23.101]  See what they were doing.
[01:17:23.241 --> 01:17:26.702]  Which shows how completely lawless all of this was.
[01:17:26.982 --> 01:17:29.083]  How many Canadians were there and what branch?
[01:17:29.143 --> 01:17:30.183]  Royal Mounted Police?
[01:17:31.543 --> 01:17:32.904]  Well, they didn't identify them.
[01:17:32.924 --> 01:17:36.385]  They just said they were from the Canadian version of the ATF.
[01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:39.685]  And there were two officers from the Canadian here.
[01:17:39.885 --> 01:17:43.886]  As far as I know, those are the only two that even identified themselves.
[01:17:43.906 --> 01:17:45.187]  Were they aggressive with you?
[01:17:45.207 --> 01:17:47.427]  I mean, how did they treat you?
[01:17:48.328 --> 01:17:49.988]  No, actually, everybody was quite...
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:58.184]  Once I decided that I wasn't going to listen to their stuff, they didn't tell me the five horror stories, and that was the end of the Canadians.
[01:18:18.358 --> 01:18:23.099]  I think it's just eerie that we now have foreign countries in here.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.101]  Well, it's all part of the new NAFTA agreement for the American Union.
[01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:28.401]  Stay there.
[01:18:28.421 --> 01:18:44.325]  I want to get specifically into the original videos you gave them, then what agents specifically then brought up the videos and books and materials, and do you believe in these, and what's your... to get into this mindset, because obviously you're listening to the show, and
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:45.640]  You're informed.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:53.725]  I'm sure you know about all the little federal and state training manuals where they list evil constitutionalists and property rights activists and homeschoolers.
[01:18:54.746 --> 01:18:58.048]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?

[01:20:53.809 --> 01:20:55.410]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:55.791 --> 01:21:01.535]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:21:01.795 --> 01:21:06.919]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:16.527]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[01:21:22.173 --> 01:21:26.177]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:21:26.377 --> 01:21:31.142]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:21:31.522 --> 01:21:37.408]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[01:21:54.164 --> 01:21:56.466]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:56.986 --> 01:21:59.749]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:22:00.743 --> 01:22:10.407]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[01:22:49.850 --> 01:23:09.760]  Aaron Zellman's coming on in just a few minutes to comment on this, and I want to keep Richard Saleta on with us.
[01:23:11.178 --> 01:23:14.060]  Richard, again, I appreciate your courage coming on there to talk about this.
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.001]  Specifically, let's go back over.
[01:23:17.962 --> 01:23:19.343]  They asked you about Aaron Zellman.
[01:23:19.383 --> 01:23:21.224]  They asked you about my videos.
[01:23:22.885 --> 01:23:23.905]  But let's go back first.
[01:23:24.206 --> 01:23:26.607]  What were the first things you gave to the sheriff?
[01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.988]  You said some of my materials and other materials.
[01:23:29.048 --> 01:23:31.010]  What were those specifically?
[01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:37.894]  Well, over the year and a half, I've given him lots of information on this.
[01:23:38.134 --> 01:23:40.215]  I've given him your videos.
[01:23:40.831 --> 01:23:41.692]  Because I have all of them.
[01:23:42.332 --> 01:23:48.736]  I don't remember exactly which ones, but I'm sure he's got Police State 1 and 2 and Road to Tyranny and all that.
[01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:51.939]  And also lots of articles, D.D.
[01:23:51.979 --> 01:23:53.660]  Kidd's One for the Road CDs.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.601]  Actually, all the officers got those.
[01:23:56.822 --> 01:23:57.682]  Well, I don't know if they got them.
[01:23:57.722 --> 01:23:58.383]  I dropped them off.
[01:23:59.604 --> 01:24:03.306]  Now, later specifically during this raid, that was brought up.
[01:24:03.326 --> 01:24:07.149]  Can you tell us as specifically, as precisely as possible what was said?
[01:24:08.524 --> 01:24:08.964]  I'll try.
[01:24:09.724 --> 01:24:15.186]  What they were really interested in, and it was the FBI who was doing just about all of the questioning.
[01:24:15.206 --> 01:24:24.449]  The ATF was just here, I think, on a ruse to get in to question me, because they didn't question me much at all, the ATF.
[01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:35.213]  The FBI was very interested in Dr. Edwin Vieira's Are You Doing All You Can for Homeland Security?, which is about reconstituting the state militias.
[01:24:36.289 --> 01:24:45.695]  And I had actually sent that with a cover letter, and I'll forward it to you, to every single church in this town plus the sheriff's department.
[01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:59.183]  So you're politically involved out in the open trying to get some type of local civil defense force, which is in the Constitution, and then they have to come raid you just to ask you questions when they could have called you on the phone.
[01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:01.411]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:01.851 --> 01:25:06.012]  We actually have no knowledge of what the raid was truly about.
[01:25:06.873 --> 01:25:07.873]  Was it about the guns?
[01:25:08.513 --> 01:25:12.894]  They didn't seem to be too interested in them other than taking them.
[01:25:12.954 --> 01:25:14.254]  What else did the FBI bring up?
[01:25:16.475 --> 01:25:22.096]  I'll let Aaron expound on this more on his, because he was first-hand knowledge, although I was there.
[01:25:22.937 --> 01:25:29.018]  They asked about Aaron Zellman, and as they were questioning about me, Aaron called.
[01:25:29.855 --> 01:25:31.395]  And I'll let Aaron pick that up from there.
[01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:33.536]  Then they asked about D.V.
[01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:33.876]  Kidd.
[01:25:33.936 --> 01:25:35.736]  Was she seditious?
[01:25:35.876 --> 01:25:39.037]  Was she involved in militias?
[01:25:39.057 --> 01:25:42.137]  Does she organize them?
[01:25:42.177 --> 01:25:45.298]  Does she have all this other stuff?
[01:25:45.658 --> 01:25:48.098]  And it's like, I'm on an email list.
[01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:51.339]  That's all I know about her.
[01:25:51.659 --> 01:25:55.980]  She writes for mainstream publications about the tax system.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:56.760]  She's a lady.
[01:25:57.928 --> 01:26:01.170]  I mean, they could go read her writings to find out about her any day.
[01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.430]  Exactly.
[01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:03.030]  That's what I told them.
[01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:04.551]  I said, well, you're the FBI.
[01:26:04.891 --> 01:26:05.712]  Go to the website.
[01:26:05.752 --> 01:26:06.372]  Give her a call.
[01:26:06.552 --> 01:26:07.532]  I'm sure she'll talk to you.
[01:26:09.693 --> 01:26:15.736]  And then they asked about Enwood Vier and pretty much the same questions, you know, is he involved in militias?
[01:26:15.956 --> 01:26:18.898]  Because I got from the interview yesterday, did they ever bring myself up?
[01:26:21.159 --> 01:26:22.139]  No, not by name.
[01:26:22.159 --> 01:26:26.041]  They didn't actually ask you by name.
[01:26:26.081 --> 01:26:26.241]  They...
[01:26:26.929 --> 01:26:39.054]  You know, they were asking about the videos, but in general, you know, because they had a pile of them, of different ones, you know, JPFOs and yours and constitutional courses by two different people.
[01:26:39.074 --> 01:26:40.334]  And what were they saying about them?
[01:26:40.374 --> 01:26:45.657]  Because... Well, they were asking if I believed in those things.
[01:26:46.437 --> 01:26:48.398]  And, of course, I look at them with a curious face.
[01:26:48.418 --> 01:26:50.418]  It's like, of course I believe in them.
[01:26:50.458 --> 01:26:51.479]  It's the Constitution.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:56.261]  And studying them and whatnot.
[01:26:56.401 --> 01:26:56.561]  But
[01:26:57.099 --> 01:27:04.044]  Yeah, they said that information was subversive and seditious, and that I believe in them.
[01:27:04.084 --> 01:27:05.325]  And I asked them straight out, too.
[01:27:05.425 --> 01:27:08.267]  I said, well, do you believe in everything the government tells you?
[01:27:08.287 --> 01:27:10.129]  And they answered yes.
[01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:17.394]  So specifically, they're pointing at a pile of videos saying that information is subversive and seditious.
[01:27:18.135 --> 01:27:18.435]  Correct.
[01:27:19.115 --> 01:27:19.936]  Unbelievable.
[01:27:21.437 --> 01:27:22.718]  Which is the photo that I sent you.
[01:27:24.787 --> 01:27:27.529]  So the photo you sent me is the pile of stuff?
[01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:29.050]  Right.
[01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:34.254]  That's all the stuff that I had carried with me to the sheriff's office on Wednesday morning for the meeting.
[01:27:34.535 --> 01:27:35.155]  I went there.
[01:27:35.175 --> 01:27:41.480]  I took it just in case it was exactly what the sheriff said.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.381]  Now, again, the sheriff engaged in treachery.
[01:27:43.401 --> 01:27:44.982]  He told you he wanted to talk about that stuff.
[01:27:45.002 --> 01:27:45.843]  He wanted to meet with you.
[01:27:46.103 --> 01:27:48.445]  He used your good faith to come in so they could grab you.
[01:27:50.146 --> 01:27:50.427]  Right.
[01:27:51.107 --> 01:27:53.349]  And I know you think I'm...
[01:27:54.571 --> 01:28:04.598]  Pussyfooting around with the sheriff a bit, but the new sheriff that has won is he is going to militarize the sheriff's department.
[01:28:05.779 --> 01:28:13.925]  The sheriff, what he did was he got me out of the place so there was nobody hurt, either myself or somebody else.
[01:28:13.945 --> 01:28:16.787]  Oh, I see, but he didn't warn you to get your family out.
[01:28:18.808 --> 01:28:20.750]  No, but he did allow me to call against
[01:28:21.368 --> 01:28:24.150]  Direct orders from the ATF and FBI.
[01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:25.690]  Well, that is good, then.
[01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:26.851]  That is good of the sheriff.
[01:28:27.531 --> 01:28:27.992]  Yeah.
[01:28:28.012 --> 01:28:38.697]  So, I believe that he was trying to do his best in a situation that he had not much control, but actually he had 100% control.
[01:28:38.737 --> 01:28:39.698]  He could have stopped it.
[01:28:40.018 --> 01:28:40.818]  Stay there.
[01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:41.379]  Stay there.
[01:28:41.419 --> 01:28:41.959]  We've got a break.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.141]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.601 --> 01:28:47.202]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:50.804]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.207 --> 01:28:54.628]  We're good to go.
[01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:12.230]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.083 --> 01:29:28.823]  We're good to go.
[01:29:28.843 --> 01:29:29.364]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.968 --> 01:30:00.210]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:06.513]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.793 --> 01:30:15.236]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:22.499]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.799 --> 01:30:23.460]  We're good to go.
[01:30:54.093 --> 01:30:58.498]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[01:30:58.678 --> 01:31:04.364]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[01:31:04.724 --> 01:31:09.629]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[01:31:09.889 --> 01:31:14.394]  It contains xantham, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[01:31:14.674 --> 01:31:15.315]  We're good to go.
[01:31:15.335 --> 01:31:15.475]  I think?
[01:31:35.797 --> 01:31:37.418]  Unleash the power of Zango today.
[01:31:37.658 --> 01:31:39.399]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633.
[01:31:39.499 --> 01:31:41.620]  That's 888-203-6633.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:48.323]  Or visit www.mangosteenmarket.com.
[01:31:48.563 --> 01:31:52.585]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[01:31:58.848 --> 01:32:01.310]  According to the FBI, this is terrorist music.
[01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.930]  Listen to it.
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:28.386]  They railed against the crown Another ragtag band Declaring independence They laid their bodies down Upon a bloody war And liberty for their descendants Thanks to the renegades
[01:32:30.581 --> 01:32:34.985]  The federal government right now is dismantling our borders, dismantling our sovereignty.
[01:32:35.065 --> 01:32:40.349]  Even Lou Dobbs admits it is, quote, the end of America as we know it, the end of our sovereignty.
[01:32:41.095 --> 01:32:41.615]  We're good to go.
[01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:12.334]  And all over the country, people with my videos, other books, JPFO material, they're being arrested, they're being taken, they're being tried.
[01:33:12.634 --> 01:33:14.294]  Kelly Rushing, again, in Kentucky.
[01:33:14.775 --> 01:33:19.256]  Other cases, we have video out of squad cars from the police fine pocket constitutions.
[01:33:19.296 --> 01:33:20.597]  They go ahead and arrest people.
[01:33:21.957 --> 01:33:27.439]  We have federal training manuals at the state level written for the states from Virginia to Texas to Arizona.
[01:33:27.499 --> 01:33:34.462]  It's all up with this article we've written, man-rated by FBI, ATF, Canadian law enforcement after handing out subversive Alex Jones material.
[01:33:35.459 --> 01:33:36.220]  We're good to go.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:36.941]  I think?
[01:33:53.755 --> 01:34:00.720]  During all of this taking place, they're at a KT ordinance, and I happened to witness over the telephone some of what happened.
[01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:06.585]  So let's bring Aaron Zellman in right now, and Richard, anytime you want to pop in, just jump in.
[01:34:06.905 --> 01:34:18.253]  Describe, Richard, where you were, what was happening, when Aaron Zellman, the founder and head of JPFO.org, called, and then what happened from there, and then Aaron can pick up there.
[01:34:22.102 --> 01:34:22.362]  Richard?
[01:34:24.062 --> 01:34:24.703]  Are you there, Richard?
[01:34:25.963 --> 01:34:26.323]  Okay.
[01:34:27.063 --> 01:34:27.403]  You know what?
[01:34:27.423 --> 01:34:29.003]  It sounds like Richard didn't understand.
[01:34:29.043 --> 01:34:30.084]  He was going to be staying with us.
[01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:32.644]  So call him back and get him back on, okay?
[01:34:33.184 --> 01:34:33.604]  Thank you.
[01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:35.425]  Aaron Zellman, describe what happened.
[01:34:35.445 --> 01:34:36.305]  The raid's going on.
[01:34:36.345 --> 01:34:37.165]  You happened to call there.
[01:34:37.205 --> 01:34:37.765]  Tell us about it.
[01:34:38.565 --> 01:34:40.626]  Yeah, it was kind of fascinating in a way.
[01:34:41.606 --> 01:34:44.087]  It's funny and scary at the same time.
[01:34:46.107 --> 01:34:51.228]  As you know, Mr. Slott had put out an email to people saying, if you don't hear from me by noon...
[01:34:51.803 --> 01:34:53.684]  You better check in and see what's going on.
[01:34:54.145 --> 01:34:56.366]  So I followed up around 3 in the afternoon, I believe.
[01:34:57.307 --> 01:34:59.088]  And he answers the phone.
[01:34:59.788 --> 01:35:02.150]  And lo and behold, he says, hold on a second.
[01:35:02.170 --> 01:35:03.231]  There's somebody who wants to talk to you.
[01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:04.512]  They want to know more about you.
[01:35:05.152 --> 01:35:08.674]  So he tells the FBI agent, hey, this guy Zellman's on the phone.
[01:35:08.714 --> 01:35:09.775]  You've been asking me about him.
[01:35:09.795 --> 01:35:10.556]  Why don't you talk to him?
[01:35:11.556 --> 01:35:13.838]  So the agent actually picks up the phone.
[01:35:15.019 --> 01:35:16.259]  And he said something about hello.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.461]  And I said, what is your name and how do you spell it?
[01:35:20.603 --> 01:35:24.184]  And he gave the phone back to Salada, saying, I don't want to talk to him.
[01:35:26.384 --> 01:35:33.366]  Now, this is after accusing JPFO of making subversive materials available.
[01:35:33.486 --> 01:35:35.907]  And what do they find subversive of JPFO?
[01:35:35.947 --> 01:35:47.169]  Well, we have our Innocence Betrayed documentary, which, as you know, Alex, shows people the dangers of gun control and how it leads to government's gone bad, dictatorships, and genocide.
[01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:49.530]  So the FBI found that subversive.
[01:35:50.268 --> 01:35:59.454]  And we have a tape that we sell called Nazi Death Camps, which is from the American Archives, dealing with the death camps during World War II.
[01:35:59.734 --> 01:36:03.296]  Eisenhower had asked the Columbia Pictures to make the movie.
[01:36:04.317 --> 01:36:07.799]  So that's what the FBI found subversive.
[01:36:08.019 --> 01:36:09.480]  Now let's be specific.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.301]  They specifically named you.
[01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:12.281]  Yes.
[01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:14.623]  They were specifically saying that about you.
[01:36:15.483 --> 01:36:15.944]  Exactly.
[01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:19.886]  So we thought that since they found us to be so interesting...
[01:36:20.849 --> 01:36:22.710]  We would take an interest in the FBI.
[01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.311]  By the way, folks, we're not joking.
[01:36:24.331 --> 01:36:30.395]  These are the actual videos in the pile, and they're looking at them, naming Aaron Zellman, asking about Aaron Zellman by name.
[01:36:30.455 --> 01:36:31.816]  Richard got accidentally disconnected.
[01:36:31.856 --> 01:36:32.936]  He's back with us.
[01:36:32.976 --> 01:36:33.917]  So please continue, Aaron.
[01:36:35.318 --> 01:36:42.842]  And so after the situation, we decided, well, maybe it's time to take an interest in the FBI since they found us so interesting.
[01:36:43.843 --> 01:36:49.106]  On June 14th, we put out an open letter to Robert Mueller, director of the FBI, saying,
[01:36:49.761 --> 01:36:52.562]  And that letter is on our website at JPFO.org.
[01:36:52.642 --> 01:36:54.202]  It's listed under previous alerts.
[01:36:55.063 --> 01:36:57.303]  And we asked Mr. Mueller to look into two things.
[01:36:58.163 --> 01:37:11.607]  One, the Nazi Ruth, the 68 Gun Control Act, and we published the letter in the Library of Congress showing clearly that the Nazi gun control laws had been translated for one Thomas Dodd, the author of the 68 Gun Control Act.
[01:37:12.308 --> 01:37:16.169]  And two, we raised the issue with Mr. Mueller about
[01:37:18.103 --> 01:37:31.071]  Maybe hundreds or thousands of innocent gun owners who are rotting in American prisons, federal prisons, who have been wrongfully convicted by the so-called experts in ATF and the federal court system.
[01:37:31.951 --> 01:37:35.814]  And we published a copy of a document prepared by the U.S.
[01:37:35.874 --> 01:37:39.296]  Congress called the CRS Report.
[01:37:40.116 --> 01:37:43.558]  And this is from the research arm of the Congress.
[01:37:44.079 --> 01:37:47.701]  And it clearly shows that there was a lack of standardized testing procedures
[01:37:48.303 --> 01:37:49.024]  At ATF.
[01:37:49.044 --> 01:37:57.311]  The significance of that, Alex, is that the experts, the so-called experts, go into court and they say whatever they want to say to convict somebody.
[01:37:57.331 --> 01:37:59.553]  There's no standardized testing procedure.
[01:37:59.593 --> 01:38:08.040]  One of their most popular things they do that's on the record hundreds of times is take a semi-automatic, totally legal, lawful, over-the-counter purchased firearm.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:14.125]  They go out and monkey with it, and after days of testing, may get it to fire fully auto two or three rounds.
[01:38:14.165 --> 01:38:14.926]  Boom, you go to prison.
[01:38:15.527 --> 01:38:15.967]  Exactly.
[01:38:16.601 --> 01:38:22.966]  So we've exposed all this, as well as the video that we have out about ATF fails the test.
[01:38:23.627 --> 01:38:40.741]  At any rate, we invited Mr. Mueller to pursue justice, to look into the situation, the obvious use of the Nazi gun control laws for federal law, and the obvious incarceration of innocent Americans.
[01:38:42.222 --> 01:38:43.283]  That was June 14th.
[01:38:44.004 --> 01:38:45.225]  As of today, July 6th,
[01:38:46.435 --> 01:38:47.476]  There's been total silence.
[01:38:49.157 --> 01:38:54.041]  Well, it's just classic behavior from these individuals.
[01:38:54.982 --> 01:38:56.784]  Before we go any further, if I could just add one thing.
[01:38:57.404 --> 01:38:58.745]  I want to make a point to people.
[01:39:00.086 --> 01:39:00.527]  Two points.
[01:39:00.687 --> 01:39:05.331]  One, this is an example of a lot of people who fear government.
[01:39:05.651 --> 01:39:11.496]  But I have to tell people right now, you have to go look in the mirror and determine if you fear government more than God.
[01:39:11.536 --> 01:39:13.277]  Because if you do, you're finished.
[01:39:13.297 --> 01:39:14.138]  You're already a slave.
[01:39:14.676 --> 01:39:16.337]  And you don't need to own a firearm anymore.
[01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:25.260]  And point number two, I want to raise this issue, and this is very sensitive, but people often ask me why Jews don't support Republicans.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:34.783]  I ask people to look around and see how Republicans are destroying and sabotaging and harassing and intimidating their own support base.
[01:39:35.743 --> 01:39:40.625]  And the question I have to ask everybody who's listening is, Jews fear Republicans.
[01:39:40.665 --> 01:39:41.325]  Can you blame them?
[01:39:43.502 --> 01:39:44.703]  Well, I would just add to this.
[01:39:44.743 --> 01:39:50.949]  Have we learned any of the names of the BATF or the FBI or the foreign Canadian minions that were there?
[01:39:51.249 --> 01:39:55.152]  And that question goes to Richard Salata, and that goes to Aaron Zellman.
[01:39:55.192 --> 01:39:56.774]  Both of you, have we found out their names yet?
[01:39:58.375 --> 01:40:07.163]  No, I only have one, which was a special agent who filed the actual warrant, which is Karen Hatch.
[01:40:08.624 --> 01:40:10.946]  And that's the only name that I have right now.
[01:40:12.168 --> 01:40:19.453]  I wasn't a good terrorist because I didn't have my pad of paper and my pencil in my top pocket to take notes when I was here.
[01:40:19.473 --> 01:40:22.655]  Aaron, have you learned about these goons?
[01:40:22.695 --> 01:40:25.917]  And then secondarily, what do you think of foreign police being there?
[01:40:27.238 --> 01:40:32.081]  Well, people should be not only fearful of that, but they should realize that we have a Supreme Court of the United States.
[01:40:33.142 --> 01:40:37.525]  One of the justices there, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is talking about using foreign law.
[01:40:38.277 --> 01:40:40.980]  To determine what the law will be in America.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.562]  She wrote that for USA Today four years ago.
[01:40:44.483 --> 01:40:53.031]  So I think that people, if they're still asleep, and they still think that everything's peachy keen in America, they better learn a foreign language or two.
[01:40:54.051 --> 01:40:55.272]  Well, I mean, look at New Orleans.
[01:40:55.292 --> 01:40:56.232]  I want to shift gears.
[01:40:56.692 --> 01:41:08.118]  We have them on ABC News and Fox and others, and of course ABC and Fox were cheerleading it, going into even high and dry wealthy areas and confiscating guns, putting people in handcuffs with the U.S.
[01:41:08.158 --> 01:41:11.459]  military, led by the FBI and BATF, taking guns.
[01:41:11.499 --> 01:41:12.640]  I mean, there it is right there.
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:21.224]  Well, I think the purpose of publicizing that is simply to make people fear the government more.
[01:41:21.844 --> 01:41:23.145]  And again, I've got to remind people,
[01:41:23.746 --> 01:41:26.107]  If you fear the government more than you do God, you're finished.
[01:41:26.308 --> 01:41:26.848]  You're a slave.
[01:41:26.868 --> 01:41:27.808]  You don't need dumb guns.
[01:41:28.169 --> 01:41:29.189]  Well, elaborate on that.
[01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:34.232]  Well, I think that you have to understand that we have God-given rights to defend our life.
[01:41:36.313 --> 01:41:38.875]  The fact that guns are available to defend our life is good.
[01:41:39.315 --> 01:41:43.217]  Anybody that tries to take your guns is bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:43.417 --> 01:41:44.378]  That's called tyranny.
[01:41:45.279 --> 01:41:52.903]  Well, there's a reason why people want to take your guns, because they want you disarmed, and they have an agenda, and that is to totally control your life or end it.
[01:41:54.099 --> 01:41:57.202]  I mean, the folks at the UN can dance around that all they want.
[01:41:57.702 --> 01:42:00.325]  The folks in Congress can dance around those points.
[01:42:00.805 --> 01:42:02.647]  But the facts are the facts are the facts.
[01:42:04.289 --> 01:42:12.211]  Well, Aaron, I know you've seen the Virginia, the Texas, the Arizona, and other training manuals where they say property rights activists are terrorists.
[01:42:12.591 --> 01:42:16.753]  Those that make frequent references to the Second Amendment are terrorists.
[01:42:16.773 --> 01:42:18.613]  I mean, homeschoolers are terrorists.
[01:42:18.993 --> 01:42:24.635]  They literally are teaching this in the law enforcement training schools.
[01:42:25.775 --> 01:42:27.916]  Well, I think we have to reach out to people...
[01:42:29.932 --> 01:42:32.214]  Actually, I have a problem with the term law enforcement.
[01:42:32.294 --> 01:42:33.975]  When I grew up as a kid... Peace officers.
[01:42:34.195 --> 01:42:35.035]  Peace officers.
[01:42:35.675 --> 01:42:39.798]  I think we have to bring peace officers back and get rid of law enforcement folks.
[01:42:40.618 --> 01:42:48.982]  We have to reach out to peace officers and remind them that their obligation to respect and obey the Bill of Rights is job one.
[01:42:49.503 --> 01:42:50.683]  Well, I mean, look at the news.
[01:42:50.803 --> 01:42:53.645]  Bush is openly getting rid of our borders, creating the American Union.
[01:42:54.304 --> 01:43:09.531]  We're losing our freedoms, and they're busy sending the BATF and FBI around harassing people that are selling completely legal and lawful kits to then manufacture firearms, something that's been done for decades and decades in this country.
[01:43:09.571 --> 01:43:15.074]  Both of you, Mr. Salata and Mr. Zellman, speak to these kits and what it's now done to this industry.
[01:43:15.354 --> 01:43:17.495]  Well, if I could just make one comment real quick, Richard.
[01:43:18.856 --> 01:43:21.797]  You say kits, but what Richard was selling was a hunk of metal.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.921]  It wasn't even a kid.
[01:43:24.941 --> 01:43:26.962]  It was just a hunk of metal, a standalone hunk of metal.
[01:43:27.722 --> 01:43:29.343]  So I'll let Richard go from here.
[01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:38.588]  Well, that's the definition given by the ATF's website, is that it's just a casting or a chunk of metal at that point.
[01:43:39.028 --> 01:43:42.690]  Until it's actually finished, then it becomes, quote, a firearm.
[01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:51.274]  And you can manufacture your own firearms just as the same as you can manufacture beer and wine for your own consumption, as long as you don't sell them.
[01:43:52.383 --> 01:43:54.044]  So that's what we sold.
[01:43:54.404 --> 01:43:56.106]  We sold basically a chunk of metal.
[01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:57.447]  I don't call them receivers.
[01:43:57.947 --> 01:44:02.230]  I call them frames because they haven't been turned into a receiver at this point.
[01:44:03.351 --> 01:44:08.375]  And it's perfectly legal to turn one into a receiver.
[01:44:08.395 --> 01:44:13.058]  And more people build my stuff for the joy of building it.
[01:44:13.858 --> 01:44:21.444]  And there is a certain amount of I get to be unknown to the powers by doing it.
[01:44:23.347 --> 01:44:29.171]  But this is a great family tradition to build your own firearms.
[01:44:29.572 --> 01:44:38.519]  And it actually promotes better safety because now that you've built it, you've put it together, you've worked with it, you've tweaked it, you know that firearm inside out.
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:49.268]  Specifically the plans and the hunk of metal, what type of firearms did this produce after the individual purchased it and lawfully built their own kit gun?
[01:44:50.309 --> 01:44:59.193]  Well, our biggest seller were the 1911, the Colt .45 pistol, and the AR-15s and the AR-10s.
[01:44:59.273 --> 01:45:02.034]  We did sell some SIG 9mm .228s.
[01:45:02.614 --> 01:45:07.036]  They weren't that popular, but they were very popular with the Canadians.
[01:45:07.636 --> 01:45:14.859]  And we also sell the Ruger MK-122 target pistol frame to build into that.
[01:45:14.879 --> 01:45:18.341]  By the way, Rich, why don't you tell them what the frame is for the Ruger pistol?
[01:45:19.449 --> 01:45:20.010]  What was that, Aaron?
[01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:22.672]  Why don't you describe the frame of the Ruger pistol?
[01:45:25.253 --> 01:45:27.015]  Those are the ones I didn't confiscate.
[01:45:27.395 --> 01:45:28.036]  They're still here.
[01:45:28.636 --> 01:45:31.899]  It's a piece of tube with a thread in the end.
[01:45:31.919 --> 01:45:36.222]  Okay, a piece of pipe with a thread on the end.
[01:45:36.242 --> 01:45:36.402]  Okay.
[01:45:37.062 --> 01:45:39.484]  Yeah, it's a piece of pipe with a thread on the end.
[01:45:39.664 --> 01:45:40.285]  That's all it is.
[01:45:40.305 --> 01:45:43.667]  So that's your chunk of metal.
[01:45:43.707 --> 01:45:46.690]  So really what you're selling is the plans...
[01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:49.722]  To build guns.
[01:45:49.802 --> 01:45:50.002]  Right.
[01:45:50.523 --> 01:45:53.224]  So now they don't want the plans to guns being out there.
[01:45:55.005 --> 01:45:55.926]  That would be my guess.
[01:45:56.246 --> 01:45:59.668]  We also had another company do some DVDs.
[01:45:59.768 --> 01:46:12.054]  I just went and designed a new bolt-together AR-15, which actually is even less percentage done than my solid cap, you know, the one that I build out of billet.
[01:46:12.254 --> 01:46:14.135]  There's actually more work involved in it.
[01:46:14.956 --> 01:46:16.637]  And we had a professional company do a
[01:46:17.296 --> 01:46:24.181]  A DVD on taking it from step one to open the package to assembling it and test firing it.
[01:46:25.002 --> 01:46:30.106]  And they were also doing DVDs for my 1911s and the regular AR-15s.
[01:46:30.146 --> 01:46:31.667]  Which is the last thing they want.
[01:46:32.427 --> 01:46:33.008]  Exactly.
[01:46:33.848 --> 01:46:37.271]  Since this raid, what has happened to other companies doing this?
[01:46:38.232 --> 01:46:46.498]  Well, up to a week, not even a week ago, a few days ago this past weekend, everybody had pulled their products off the shelves.
[01:46:46.906 --> 01:46:53.791]  Because I went to all the places that I know that sell them, and everybody had pulled their 80% frames off the market.
[01:46:54.251 --> 01:47:04.919]  So no judge, no jury, no law, no precedent, no nothing, no arrest, just a raid, grab your stuff, and now a bunch of other companies doing similar things have shut down.
[01:47:05.739 --> 01:47:06.060]  Correct.
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:09.542]  Yeah, they've literally destroyed that marketplace.
[01:47:11.947 --> 01:47:16.189]  Which is what Bob Barr said that the government is doing just by fiat.
[01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.890]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:18.451]  Right.
[01:47:18.771 --> 01:47:33.759]  Even if this all comes out as, oh, we made a mistake, nothing's charged, here's your stuff back, people are now going to be so afraid to buy them that it may put us out of business anyway because they've instilled the fear in the public.
[01:47:34.588 --> 01:47:36.250]  And go back to Aaron's previous quote.
[01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:49.421]  What about a class action suit by the manufacturers of these raw kits or these plans and also the people, the purchase list of your customers that they grabbed?
[01:47:49.481 --> 01:47:52.423]  I mean, what about getting on the offensive against these crooks?
[01:47:53.544 --> 01:47:56.207]  Well, we'll see where that leads to next week.
[01:47:56.727 --> 01:48:02.192]  We have an appointment with the attorney on Monday and we'll start discussing our plans and
[01:48:02.754 --> 01:48:08.758]  Did you ever bring it up to these guys that nothing you've done was illegal, it's all on the record, the law says you can do it, and why are you here?
[01:48:08.778 --> 01:48:24.909]  Yeah, actually the ATS lady asked, you know, I told her, I said, even by your own website, which is under their frequently asked questions, item 6A, states it, and she said the website's wrong.
[01:48:27.622 --> 01:48:30.923]  The website's wrong.
[01:48:30.943 --> 01:48:31.443]  Well, all right.
[01:48:31.763 --> 01:48:33.264]  I guess you should tell the webmaster.
[01:48:33.704 --> 01:48:40.265]  And so, as Bob Barr said, they're not going to tell you what... I mean, we know what the law is, but they don't go by the law, do they, Aaron?
[01:48:40.285 --> 01:48:41.406]  They just make up what they want.
[01:48:41.746 --> 01:48:43.526]  Oh, in fact, I have to tell you something.
[01:48:43.746 --> 01:48:46.347]  We've been working with another manufacturer, Historic Arms.
[01:48:47.247 --> 01:48:56.850]  On our website is a letter from the BATF to Mr. Savage, Historic Arms, telling him on no uncertain terms
[01:48:57.992 --> 01:49:01.413]  That they at the BATF are not governed by federal laws.
[01:49:02.154 --> 01:49:03.874]  That the laws don't apply to them.
[01:49:04.935 --> 01:49:11.517]  And that he shouldn't think, foolishly and naively, I'm adding this now on my own, that somehow they're bound by any law.
[01:49:12.437 --> 01:49:14.338]  That's on our website for people to go look at.
[01:49:15.038 --> 01:49:20.240]  So, just like Bush saying he is above the law, now his agencies say, we are above the law.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.420]  We don't enforce law.
[01:49:21.681 --> 01:49:22.641]  We just do whatever we want.
[01:49:24.048 --> 01:49:29.052]  Well, whatever they want to do, their agenda is to destroy gun ownership in America.
[01:49:31.694 --> 01:49:33.055]  And Bush... Put it mildly.
[01:49:33.075 --> 01:49:34.256]  That's just putting it mildly.
[01:49:34.896 --> 01:49:37.698]  And Bush has radically expanded the BATF.
[01:49:38.559 --> 01:49:43.062]  So, again, keep the W stickers on your car and throw your guns in the ocean.
[01:49:43.963 --> 01:49:46.425]  And keep wondering why Jews don't vote for Republicans.
[01:49:47.286 --> 01:49:48.366]  I have to keep bringing that up.
[01:49:48.406 --> 01:49:51.089]  All right, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.489]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:57.692]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.373 --> 01:49:59.654]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.854 --> 01:50:05.598]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.878 --> 01:50:11.142]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.422 --> 01:50:13.043]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order...
[01:50:13.223 --> 01:50:15.584]  The program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.744 --> 01:50:19.526]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.786 --> 01:50:24.409]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.489 --> 01:50:30.752]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.812 --> 01:50:32.573]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:33.113 --> 01:50:35.195]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tarion today.

[01:50:50.849 --> 01:50:52.911]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.795 --> 01:51:01.321]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.602 --> 01:51:12.511]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:13.031]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.253 --> 01:51:29.754]  That's right.
[01:51:29.934 --> 01:51:37.041]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:37.341 --> 01:51:46.090]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:46.150 --> 01:51:46.590]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.

[01:53:07.427 --> 01:53:08.868]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:09.228 --> 01:53:23.732]  Before we go back to our two guests, who are fighting for your Second Amendment rights on the front lines and paying for it, I hope that all of you will visit Infowars.com and join us in the information war.
[01:53:23.772 --> 01:53:25.213]  Get my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:53:25.253 --> 01:53:29.174]  We have an emergency edition of the finished film now being put out.
[01:53:29.861 --> 01:53:31.382]  But it doesn't have the extras on it.
[01:53:31.402 --> 01:53:32.642]  That's about a month away.
[01:53:33.082 --> 01:53:34.943]  We have to have it sent off to be mass produced.
[01:53:34.963 --> 01:53:35.924]  These are burned copies.
[01:53:35.944 --> 01:53:36.984]  They're high quality copies.
[01:53:37.564 --> 01:53:38.725]  We made here for the conference.
[01:53:39.285 --> 01:53:40.486]  Brought back quite a few of them.
[01:53:41.146 --> 01:53:42.607]  They're very close to being gone.
[01:53:43.087 --> 01:53:45.248]  You need to get your copy of Terror Storm.
[01:53:45.288 --> 01:53:46.208]  We need to get this out.
[01:53:46.228 --> 01:53:49.149]  It exposes how the government has carried out terror attacks all over the world.
[01:53:49.269 --> 01:53:53.791]  Our government, other governments, the British, Israel, the Germans under Hitler.
[01:53:54.532 --> 01:53:56.753]  Then we get into the London bombing, Madrid bombings, 9-11.
[01:53:58.027 --> 01:54:00.210]  We get into the Iraq War, so much more.
[01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:01.312]  It's such an important film.
[01:54:01.352 --> 01:54:01.993]  Terror Storm.
[01:54:02.333 --> 01:54:05.578]  While you're at it, get Road to Tyranny, get Martial Law, get Order of Death.
[01:54:06.199 --> 01:54:07.922]  We've got a bunch of big discounts on the websites.
[01:54:07.942 --> 01:54:09.384]  You can get multiple copies of the films.
[01:54:09.564 --> 01:54:11.467]  Again, Infowars.com to get a hard copy.
[01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:13.086]  We're call-toll free.
[01:54:13.426 --> 01:54:21.270]  They can take your order and also tell you about some of the other films and discounts we're offering.
[01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:21.910]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:22.291 --> 01:54:27.053]  And, of course, your purchase also makes this broadcast, what we do here, defending the entire Bill of Rights, possible.
[01:54:27.073 --> 01:54:27.133]  1-888-253-3139.

[01:54:36.429 --> 01:54:37.770]  See all 15 of my films.
[01:54:37.810 --> 01:54:42.052]  We're uploading all of our 9-11 conference for members at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:54:42.072 --> 01:54:43.073]  A lot of it's already up there.

[01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:07.495]  And there'll be a few weeks where it's not available, ladies and gentlemen, before the official DVD comes out.
[01:55:07.955 --> 01:55:12.641]  And I am signing every copy that goes out until the official DVD comes out.
[01:55:13.643 --> 01:55:18.409]  Gentlemen, in closing, Aaron Zellman and, of course, the man who went through this hell, Richard Salata,
[01:55:19.349 --> 01:55:20.730]  They came, they grabbed your stuff.
[01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:22.332]  It's been almost a month now.
[01:55:22.392 --> 01:55:23.733]  They haven't given it back to you.
[01:55:23.813 --> 01:55:29.458]  Are they saying they'll ever give you your kits or the names of the people that purchased from you back?
[01:55:29.818 --> 01:55:31.460]  They broke your computer in the process.
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:32.480]  Are they going to pay for that?
[01:55:33.741 --> 01:55:37.925]  Basically, you got raided with a fake warrant and now you haven't been charged with anything.
[01:55:38.185 --> 01:55:38.846]  What's going to happen?
[01:55:40.227 --> 01:55:41.248]  I don't know at this point.
[01:55:41.408 --> 01:55:42.989]  We're sort of in limbo.
[01:55:43.009 --> 01:55:45.552]  Like you said, we're on the front lines fighting for this.
[01:55:45.652 --> 01:55:46.993]  I didn't make a whole lot of money
[01:55:47.614 --> 01:55:48.775]  There's more than that.
[01:55:48.815 --> 01:55:49.015]  Yeah.
[01:55:49.295 --> 01:55:51.918]  But could you imagine the fight we could put up over this?
[01:56:13.634 --> 01:56:16.877]  If everybody would just give a dollar, but you know and I know what's going to happen.
[01:56:16.897 --> 01:56:24.263]  There'll be several people that'll step up, a handful if you can count on one hand, that'll put up some significant money.
[01:56:25.344 --> 01:56:26.725]  Well, that's how it always is.
[01:56:26.745 --> 01:56:30.287]  Aaron Zellman, we need to fight back on this issue.
[01:56:31.568 --> 01:56:39.715]  Well, there's no doubt about it, and I think that probably the best thing people can do right now is not shake in their boots, but stand tall.
[01:56:41.533 --> 01:56:42.913]  They get very clear to the government.
[01:56:42.933 --> 01:56:44.474]  We don't fear the government.
[01:56:44.494 --> 01:56:45.094]  We fear God.
[01:56:45.674 --> 01:56:50.116]  We were talking during a break, Aaron, and you said they're getting nasty, they're getting aggressive, they're getting desperate.
[01:56:50.496 --> 01:56:50.936]  I agree.
[01:56:50.976 --> 01:56:53.417]  I think they know they're losing their fight to get our guns.
[01:56:54.517 --> 01:57:01.160]  Well, let's hope that's the case, Alex, because we have to make sure that they understand that they lose the fight.
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:04.481]  Because, to put it bluntly, our life is on the line.
[01:57:05.592 --> 01:57:06.212]  Oh, certainly.
[01:57:06.933 --> 01:57:09.014]  I mean, it's a fight that's neck and neck.
[01:57:09.074 --> 01:57:12.916]  I just think they realize that a lot of us aren't going to surrender to them.
[01:57:14.397 --> 01:57:20.621]  Well, I hope they realize that, and I hope the people realize that there is an agenda afoot to disarm the American people.
[01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:29.266]  Gentlemen, do five more minutes with me, because I want to give out contact info for both of you and find out how we can support what you're doing, because this affects us all.
[01:57:29.826 --> 01:57:31.607]  They want your guns, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:31.627 --> 01:57:32.488]  They've set it on the record.
[01:57:34.031 --> 01:57:37.933]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.253 --> 01:57:39.114]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:39.134 --> 01:57:39.614]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.794 --> 01:57:40.655]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.695 --> 01:57:44.437]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.637 --> 01:57:47.498]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.518 --> 01:57:49.239]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.331 --> 01:58:02.272]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.512 --> 01:58:06.634]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.754 --> 01:58:15.836]  It's like Waco as they're ramming the big tanks into the building, running over people, crushing the entire back of the building, saying, this is not an assault, this is not an assault.
[01:58:16.297 --> 01:58:20.798]  They're assaulting our Second Amendment rights everywhere, attacking them viciously.
[01:58:21.534 --> 01:58:25.964]  Increasing and marshalling their forces while meanwhile telling us everything's fine, everything's fine.
[01:58:26.385 --> 01:58:28.069]  You have a right for us to take your guns.
[01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:29.152]  That's your second amendment.
[01:58:31.386 --> 01:58:33.026]  And I've studied the BATF.
[01:58:33.326 --> 01:58:38.508]  It goes back to the regulators, the people who go around shaking folks down for brewing whiskey illegally, not paying their taxes.
[01:58:38.928 --> 01:58:45.129]  So it's been one of the only really criminal federal agencies that we had 175, 80 years ago.
[01:58:45.509 --> 01:58:57.212]  So they have a long history of being crooks before other agencies were, of being regulators, kind of like the types you see in some of the old westerns that come in for the railroad to move the people out, the squatters.
[01:58:58.275 --> 01:58:59.617]  It's that type.
[01:58:59.717 --> 01:59:05.343]  And really, they're washed-up lawyers, most of them, who can't make money in the private sector.
[01:59:05.363 --> 01:59:07.766]  They can't have a real practice, and they want to be rambos.
[01:59:08.287 --> 01:59:10.449]  And they prey on little families, on innocent people.
[01:59:10.489 --> 01:59:13.653]  They don't really go after criminals with guns in most cases.
[01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:15.295]  And I've had a run-in with the BATF.
[01:59:16.385 --> 01:59:17.786]  Yes, I've had a chance to talk to them.
[01:59:17.806 --> 01:59:20.347]  I've had them come up and say rude things to me at the gun show.
[01:59:20.967 --> 01:59:25.849]  I even had one time the BATF claimed a gun I had wasn't properly serial numbered.
[01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:27.110]  That was hellish.
[01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:33.112]  They radiated the atmosphere that I've gotten being around hardcore felons.
[01:59:33.472 --> 01:59:38.494]  I mean, they could all be cast right now for Hollywood movies as hardcore gangsters.
[01:59:38.815 --> 01:59:39.595]  It's because they are.
[01:59:40.396 --> 01:59:41.837]  And they have to lose their souls.
[01:59:41.917 --> 01:59:42.578]  They go in there.
[01:59:42.598 --> 01:59:43.699]  They're anti-Second Amendment.
[01:59:43.719 --> 01:59:46.401]  They're there to lie, cheat, and steal to get the job done.
[01:59:47.082 --> 01:59:48.783]  And they're horrible, horrible people.
[01:59:49.624 --> 01:59:50.425]  They have no honor.
[01:59:50.945 --> 01:59:51.686]  And the U.N.
[01:59:51.706 --> 01:59:52.707]  has said they want your guns.
[01:59:52.727 --> 01:59:53.708]  The federal government has said.
[01:59:53.748 --> 01:59:58.792]  Josh Sugarman of Violence Policy Center has said the plan is to take your guns.
[01:59:59.192 --> 02:00:00.353]  In closing, Aaron Zellman.
[02:00:00.393 --> 02:00:03.716]  In closing, Richard Salata.
[02:00:04.157 --> 02:00:05.818]  Both of you gentlemen, how do we support you?
[02:00:05.838 --> 02:00:07.199]  How do we get behind you?
[02:00:07.239 --> 02:00:07.960]  How do we fight this?
[02:00:09.107 --> 02:00:10.407]  Richard, why don't you go ahead first?
[02:00:11.068 --> 02:00:11.388]  Okay.
[02:00:12.868 --> 02:00:16.729]  Well, what we need is people to donate to Gun Owners of America.
[02:00:16.749 --> 02:00:19.810]  They're setting up something on their website for the legal battle.
[02:00:21.851 --> 02:00:25.692]  I'm going to put my website... Actually, the website's back up and the order forms are back up.
[02:00:27.333 --> 02:00:34.575]  They took almost $30,000 worth of stuff from me, and I need to make good on the people who...
[02:00:35.501 --> 02:00:38.463]  Yeah, so why don't people call and buy your DVDs on how to make firearms?
[02:00:38.543 --> 02:00:41.665]  Well, everything's back up on the website.
[02:00:41.685 --> 02:00:43.927]  They can order things now, and I'll swap you, Alex, for a membership to...
[02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:06.653]  I would like to encourage people to make a serious commitment to keeping freedom alive.
[02:01:30.174 --> 02:01:34.222]  One of the best ways that I think other people can do that is to spread knowledge.
[02:01:34.924 --> 02:01:39.754]  The more people who understand the issue, that understand the danger,
[02:01:41.315 --> 02:01:45.276]  The faster it will be for us to stay free, the easier it will be for us to stay free.
[02:01:45.416 --> 02:01:47.036]  Well, we carry Innocence Betrayed.
[02:01:47.056 --> 02:01:50.817]  You get three little booklets for free when you order it on DVD and VHS.
[02:01:50.837 --> 02:01:52.197]  We have it at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:52.217 --> 02:01:53.237]  They support you, Aaron.
[02:01:53.257 --> 02:01:53.918]  They support me.
[02:01:54.278 --> 02:01:55.378]  They support the Second Amendment.
[02:01:55.398 --> 02:02:00.319]  They should all call right now or go on the website and get Innocence Betrayed from InfoWars.com.
[02:02:00.659 --> 02:02:05.000]  By the way, Alex, we're doing a new documentary film on the VATF.
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:06.000]  It's called The Gang.
[02:02:07.199 --> 02:02:09.963]  And we're going to expose the criminality of the gang.
[02:02:10.083 --> 02:02:15.791]  In fact, we've already done an interview with Richard.
[02:02:16.132 --> 02:02:19.857]  Well, you heard my description in closing saying they're like mafia.
[02:02:20.077 --> 02:02:21.439]  Is that accurate in your experience?
[02:02:21.699 --> 02:02:24.123]  Well, I refer to them as government criminals, gov crims.
[02:02:25.054 --> 02:02:26.335]  GovCrims, that's right.
[02:02:26.835 --> 02:02:27.435]  GovCrims.
[02:02:28.756 --> 02:02:29.476]  We're going to fight them.
[02:02:29.736 --> 02:02:30.377]  They're the crooks.
[02:02:30.417 --> 02:02:31.897]  They don't have the strength that good people have.
[02:02:32.238 --> 02:02:34.439]  Good people have always been stronger if you can just get them moving.
[02:02:34.899 --> 02:02:37.780]  Gentlemen, thank you both for coming on with us and exposing the GovCrims.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:39.301]  Okay, thank you.
[02:02:39.341 --> 02:02:40.241]  Thank you, Aaron Zellman.
[02:02:40.521 --> 02:02:41.782]  Thank you, Richard.
[02:02:41.802 --> 02:02:42.643]  All right, God bless you.
[02:02:42.663 --> 02:02:43.423]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:02:46.067 --> 02:02:50.373]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.593 --> 02:02:55.019]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:59.545]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.586 --> 02:03:00.927]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:06.934]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.994 --> 02:03:13.922]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:14.062 --> 02:03:16.065]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.445 --> 02:03:26.727]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:27.047 --> 02:03:32.408]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:47.395 --> 02:03:48.436]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.756 --> 02:03:51.538]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.799 --> 02:03:55.962]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.382 --> 02:03:57.223]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.543 --> 02:04:02.107]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.594 --> 02:04:04.715]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.215 --> 02:04:19.899]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.939 --> 02:04:27.062]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:56.310]  You want answers?
[02:05:57.070 --> 02:05:57.971]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.991 --> 02:06:02.573]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.793 --> 02:06:06.915]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.256 --> 02:06:10.057]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:06:10.097 --> 02:06:10.817]  until 2 p.m.
[02:06:10.838 --> 02:06:13.119]  Central Standard Time, we're here live.
[02:06:13.219 --> 02:06:15.040]  Then we're back from 9 to midnight.
[02:06:16.639 --> 02:06:20.922]  About three weeks ago, four weeks ago, a caller called in who'd been doing research online.
[02:06:20.942 --> 02:06:29.508]  He found the Kennedy speech where he was talking about secret societies manipulating, taking over America, and how a free press was needed to counter it.
[02:06:29.788 --> 02:06:31.569]  I'm not going to air the whole 19-minute speech.
[02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:33.010]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:06:33.370 --> 02:06:42.957]  Since the listener found it, since we posted it, a lot of other shows have aired it and played it, and so I thought, well, we should do that here instead of just playing two or three minutes of it.
[02:06:42.977 --> 02:06:46.279]  So I'm going to play a large portion of it at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:49.819 --> 02:06:53.865]  I want to take some calls right now, and I always try to keep my eyes on the prize.
[02:06:53.885 --> 02:07:02.957]  I always try to expose the New World Order, defend the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, show how criminals in government are usurping our freedoms, the bad things they're doing.
[02:07:03.097 --> 02:07:04.780]  And so many listeners...
[02:07:05.456 --> 02:07:08.700]  Over the years, you know, say, Alex, we should all work together.
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:10.663]  You should team up with this person or that person.
[02:07:10.683 --> 02:07:12.605]  And I never really respond to that on air.
[02:07:13.066 --> 02:07:15.008]  I don't team up, quote, with a lot of people.
[02:07:15.049 --> 02:07:19.234]  I mean, I bring people on and try to elevate them, try to give them attention, try to support them.
[02:07:19.254 --> 02:07:22.318]  If you hear somebody on the show, it means they're good people.
[02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:31.722]  If you stop hearing them on the show, you're not going to get a big expose on why they're bad, because I can't turn my show into that.
[02:07:32.602 --> 02:07:34.842]  You're just going to notice that I'm not trucking with them.
[02:07:34.882 --> 02:07:36.402]  I'm not trafficking with them.
[02:07:36.842 --> 02:07:38.383]  I'm not sitting with them.
[02:07:38.443 --> 02:07:39.403]  I'm not around them.
[02:07:41.543 --> 02:07:43.604]  Because I'm not going to send people into the rocks.
[02:07:44.504 --> 02:07:45.764]  It's something I refuse to do.
[02:07:48.084 --> 02:07:51.105]  And I have been attacked by...
[02:07:52.991 --> 02:08:00.053]  It's got to be over 50 major national publications in the last four and a half, five years since I began exposing 9-11.
[02:08:00.433 --> 02:08:03.334]  I've been attacked many times before that, but nothing like it's been now.
[02:08:03.394 --> 02:08:11.697]  New York Times, Washington Post, Vanity Fair, Popular Mechanics, American Legion, Miami Papers.
[02:08:11.737 --> 02:08:16.038]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on if we tried to list all of them.
[02:08:17.941 --> 02:08:29.070]  The good news is, one of the biggest French newspapers in France, in fact it's in the top two, it's debatable which one's the biggest, just came out with a big 9-11 story and mentioned our work and said it may be an inside job.
[02:08:30.271 --> 02:08:31.352]  The evidence points at it.
[02:08:32.132 --> 02:08:34.614]  So the good news is, more and more is starting to come out.
[02:08:37.737 --> 02:08:45.463]  But I get attacked quite a bit, and then listeners always ask me, well why don't you defend yourself, or why don't you come out and expose these people?
[02:08:47.826 --> 02:08:50.047]  If I did that, it would be a very boring broadcast.
[02:08:50.167 --> 02:08:51.648]  So many other people have done that.
[02:08:51.688 --> 02:08:53.749]  They've been caught in that COINTELPRO plan.
[02:08:54.089 --> 02:08:57.030]  That's what the globalists mean for us to do, and it's very, very destructive.
[02:08:59.111 --> 02:09:06.154]  But when there are things going on or happening in my own backyard, over and over again, that don't stop.
[02:09:06.174 --> 02:09:07.994]  And understand, they don't hurt me.
[02:09:08.154 --> 02:09:11.396]  I know it's hurting other people that are involved in it.
[02:09:11.636 --> 02:09:14.337]  I know that it's an ongoing thing, and
[02:09:15.063 --> 02:09:21.524]  So then I get on air and I make a few statements about it and the individuals doing it immediately feel the heat because I am respected.
[02:09:21.784 --> 02:09:23.765]  People have been watching and listening to me for 12 years.
[02:09:23.805 --> 02:09:26.065]  They know I have a track record for all my foibles.
[02:09:26.225 --> 02:09:26.905]  I'm genuine.
[02:09:27.346 --> 02:09:28.446]  I attempt to tell the truth.
[02:09:28.506 --> 02:09:30.906]  We have a pretty good track record of giving people good data.
[02:09:33.427 --> 02:09:43.989]  And then when I expose these individuals just with a glancing blow, not even by name, it's so devastating to them that they shrink back and say, oh, truce, let's be friends, let's be nice.
[02:09:45.248 --> 02:09:45.989]  You know, truce.
[02:09:46.289 --> 02:09:47.130]  Well, there is no truce.
[02:09:47.190 --> 02:09:52.713]  If somebody walks up to you and smacks you in the face, and then you agree to not slug them back, that's not a truce.
[02:09:52.773 --> 02:09:56.936]  You've just basically let someone verbally slander and libel and assault you.
[02:09:58.557 --> 02:10:00.979]  Again, for the greater good, I just ignore it and keep moving forward.
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:10.425]  And if I mention the train of things I've seen, just the unbelievable nature of it, you would even amaze this audience.
[02:10:12.166 --> 02:10:12.266]  And...
[02:10:13.166 --> 02:10:18.010]  There's some good done by the blob overall, so I've tried to control myself.
[02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:24.755]  But imagine the treachery of, oh, don't say anything else bad about us, and we promise we won't attack you anymore.
[02:10:25.375 --> 02:10:40.286]  When I finally, for like a year and a half, took it, and then finally just made a few comments that were so devastating that they came begging for me to leave them alone, and then they're right back savagely slandering myself and my family and others and other good people that I am not going to put up with it.
[02:10:41.107 --> 02:10:42.468]  So if one more thing...
[02:10:43.641 --> 02:10:50.606]  By that other radio network that said about me, I swear to God, I am going to expose everything about you 110%.
[02:10:51.006 --> 02:10:54.708]  And I know you won't be able to control yourself, and I'm a very busy man.
[02:10:54.748 --> 02:10:57.130]  I'm going to go ahead and write the article, and I'm going to have it ready.
[02:10:57.510 --> 02:11:03.354]  And the next time you open your fat mouth, and the next time you lie about me and other good people, I am going to sink you.
[02:11:03.734 --> 02:11:05.676]  Now, you have heard it directly from me.
[02:11:06.196 --> 02:11:07.217]  You are treacherous.
[02:11:07.817 --> 02:11:14.763]  You sit there for a few months after you asked me not to destroy you, and then you sit there and snipe at me as soon as I turn my back.
[02:11:15.444 --> 02:11:17.105]  One more time.
[02:11:17.946 --> 02:11:18.807]  One more time!
[02:11:20.368 --> 02:11:22.090]  And I am going to rout you out of this town.
[02:11:22.410 --> 02:11:23.211]  Guaranteed.
[02:11:24.071 --> 02:11:25.012]  Guaranteed.
[02:11:25.993 --> 02:11:27.334]  All right, I'm done talking about it.
[02:11:28.215 --> 02:11:30.457]  Let's go ahead and play part of the Kennedy speech right now.
[02:11:31.624 --> 02:11:35.805]  Let's go ahead and play part of the Kennedy speech right now where he's talking about secret societies.
[02:11:35.825 --> 02:11:38.046]  This is just a few months before he was killed.
[02:11:38.366 --> 02:11:41.087]  Here is John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1963.
[02:11:41.127 --> 02:11:41.767]  Roll it.
[02:11:41.787 --> 02:11:53.231]  Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate very much your generous invitation to be here tonight.
[02:11:55.792 --> 02:12:01.034]  You bear heavy responsibilities these days and the article I read
[02:12:02.349 --> 02:12:11.051]  Some time ago, reminded me of how particularly heavily the burdens of present-day events bear upon your profession.
[02:12:12.271 --> 02:12:29.035]  You may remember that in 1851, New York Herald Tribune, under the sponsorship and publishing of Horace Greeley, employed as its London correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of Karl Marx,
[02:12:30.384 --> 02:12:52.521]  We are told that foreign correspondent Marx, stone broke, and with a family ill and undernourished, constantly appealed to Greeley and managing editor Charles Dana for an increase in his munificent salary of $5 per installment, a salary which he and Engels ungratefully labeled as the lousiest, petty bourgeois cheating.
[02:12:54.202 --> 02:12:59.106]  But when all his financial appeals were refused, Marx looked around
[02:12:59.855 --> 02:13:00.375]  Thank you very much.
[02:13:29.170 --> 02:13:30.510]  Have treated him more kindly.
[02:13:32.931 --> 02:13:39.953]  If only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different.
[02:13:40.133 --> 02:13:58.617]  I hope all publishers will bear this lesson in mind the next time they receive a poverty-stricken appeal from a small increase in the expense account
[02:13:59.298 --> 02:14:01.379]  From an obscure newspaper man.
[02:14:07.142 --> 02:14:11.324]  I have selected as the title of my remarks tonight, the President and the Press.
[02:14:12.325 --> 02:14:20.109]  Some may suggest that this would be more naturally worded, the President versus the Press, but those are not my sentiments tonight.
[02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:28.133]  It is true, however, that when a well-known diplomat from another country demanded recently that our State Department
[02:14:29.119 --> 02:14:30.560]  Nevertheless, my purpose here tonight
[02:14:58.593 --> 02:15:02.716]  Is not to deliver the usual assault on the so-called one-party press.
[02:15:03.697 --> 02:15:13.504]  On the contrary, in recent months, I have rarely heard any complaints about political bias in the press, except from a few Republicans.
[02:15:15.486 --> 02:15:22.311]  Nor is it my purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of presidential press conferences.
[02:15:23.212 --> 02:15:27.255]  I think it is highly beneficial to have some 20 million Americans
[02:15:28.228 --> 02:15:39.673]  Regularly sit in on these conferences to observe, if I may say so, the incisive, the intelligent, and the courteous qualities displayed by your Washington correspondents.
[02:15:44.455 --> 02:15:56.361]  Nor, finally, are these remarks intended to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any President and his family if, in the last few months,
[02:15:57.168 --> 02:16:03.954]  Your White House reporters and photographers have been attending church services with regularity.
[02:16:07.237 --> 02:16:08.858]  That has surely done them no harm.
[02:16:18.287 --> 02:16:24.132]  On the other hand, I realize that your staff and wire service photographers may be complaining
[02:16:24.824 --> 02:16:30.809]  That they do not enjoy the same green privileges, the local golf courses, which they once did.
[02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:38.775]  It is true that my predecessor did not object, as I do, to pictures of one's golfing skill in action.
[02:16:39.476 --> 02:16:43.239]  But neither, on the other hand, did he ever bean a Secret Service man.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:50.985]  My topic tonight is a more sober one, of concern to publishers as well as editors.
[02:16:51.926 --> 02:16:54.268]  I want to talk about our common responsibilities
[02:16:55.034 --> 02:17:08.442]  In the face of a common danger, the events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some, but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years.
[02:17:09.842 --> 02:17:23.130]  Whatever our hopes may be for the future, for reducing this threat or living with it, there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival
[02:17:28.976 --> 02:17:34.981]  We'll be back here in just a few minutes to get into the meat of the speech later.
[02:17:35.001 --> 02:17:42.888]  We'll continue with the speech, get into the important parts, and then we will take some of your calls and get into a whole range of news we haven't even mentioned yet.
[02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:44.289]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:44.329 --> 02:17:45.030]  This is Genesis.
[02:17:47.403 --> 02:17:51.906]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.266 --> 02:17:56.349]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.649 --> 02:17:57.190]  We listened.
[02:17:57.510 --> 02:18:02.493]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.773 --> 02:18:03.254]  We listened.
[02:18:03.634 --> 02:18:06.676]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:07.096 --> 02:18:07.636]  We listened.
[02:18:08.097 --> 02:18:11.459]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:18:11.499 --> 02:18:12.039]  We're good to go.

[02:20:45.328 --> 02:20:46.408]  Hi, Mary.
[02:20:46.568 --> 02:20:47.569]  Good morning, Tom.
[02:20:47.809 --> 02:20:48.850]  Oh, you don't look well.
[02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:50.671]  I took your advice with a spoonful of sugar.
[02:20:50.691 --> 02:20:52.192]  It didn't give me the energy you said it would.
[02:20:52.466 --> 02:20:54.047]  Spoonful of sugar, right.
[02:20:54.267 --> 02:20:55.649]  That's an embarrassing pastime.
[02:20:55.869 --> 02:20:57.090]  I'm a changed woman, Tom.
[02:20:57.330 --> 02:21:00.393]  I found the products at OPCpure.com to be exceptional.
[02:21:00.613 --> 02:21:05.557]  They're all-natural, energy-giving supplements, restore your body's health, and keeps you going without groggy side effects.

[02:21:07.819 --> 02:21:09.040]  Ooh, I love the sound of that.
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:12.463]  Just a spoonful of OPCpure.com helps the energy go up.
[02:21:12.823 --> 02:21:14.804]  Pure, unadulterated, raw energy.

[02:21:16.666 --> 02:21:19.128]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:21:19.588 --> 02:21:21.430]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:21:22.202 --> 02:21:25.386]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:21:26.026 --> 02:21:32.514]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[02:21:36.338 --> 02:21:37.679]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:48.973 --> 02:21:49.513]  Don't worry.
[02:21:49.933 --> 02:21:51.493]  This show is documented.
[02:21:51.974 --> 02:21:55.254]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.314 --> 02:22:01.455]  Alright, here's where John F. Kennedy gets into the meat and potatoes of his speech.
[02:22:01.495 --> 02:22:02.915]  Talking about secret societies.
[02:22:03.836 --> 02:22:07.716]  Of course, the average American doesn't believe government corruption exists or secret societies exist.
[02:22:07.776 --> 02:22:09.337]  It's just a historical fact.
[02:22:09.377 --> 02:22:12.957]  But again, we have a general public who thinks WMDs were found in Iraq.
[02:22:12.977 --> 02:22:13.617]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:22:14.137 --> 02:22:17.758]  This deadly challenge imposes upon our society...
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:23.081]  Two requirements of direct concern, both to the press and to the President.
[02:22:24.241 --> 02:22:33.723]  Two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril.
[02:22:35.003 --> 02:22:43.525]  I refer first to the need for far greater public information, and second to the need for far greater official secrecy.
[02:22:44.746 --> 02:22:46.646]  The very word secrecy is repugnant.
[02:22:47.338 --> 02:22:49.059]  In a free and open society.
[02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:59.305]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically, opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings.
[02:23:00.366 --> 02:23:11.853]  We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it.
[02:23:12.953 --> 02:23:13.494]  Even today,
[02:23:14.554 --> 02:23:21.096]  There is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.
[02:23:22.197 --> 02:23:29.939]  Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it.
[02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:41.003]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:45.082]  To the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[02:23:46.063 --> 02:23:49.825]  That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control.
[02:23:50.926 --> 02:24:10.858]  And no official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes, or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.
[02:24:12.162 --> 02:24:29.711]  But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation to reexamine his own standards and to recognize the nature of our country's peril.
[02:24:30.832 --> 02:24:39.917]  In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort based largely on self-discipline
[02:24:40.697 --> 02:24:43.398]  To prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy.
[02:24:44.578 --> 02:24:54.661]  In times of clear and present danger, the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public's need for national security.
[02:24:55.801 --> 02:24:57.621]  Today, no war has been declared.
[02:24:57.641 --> 02:25:04.823]  And however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion.
[02:25:06.024 --> 02:25:07.764]  Our way of life is under attack.
[02:25:08.871 --> 02:25:13.193]  Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe.
[02:25:14.133 --> 02:25:16.334]  The survival of our friends is in danger.
[02:25:17.334 --> 02:25:19.055]  And yet no war has been declared.
[02:25:20.095 --> 02:25:22.896]  No borders have been crossed by marching troops.
[02:25:23.916 --> 02:25:25.237]  No missiles have been fired.
[02:25:26.437 --> 02:25:36.581]  If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed
[02:25:37.225 --> 02:25:38.765]  A greater threat to our security.
[02:25:39.906 --> 02:25:49.548]  If you are awaiting a finding of clear and present danger, then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear, and its presence has never been more imminent.
[02:25:50.788 --> 02:26:03.071]  It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions, by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper.
[02:26:04.071 --> 02:26:05.972]  For we are opposed around the world
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:29.667]  By a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence, on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.
[02:26:30.807 --> 02:26:35.929]  It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources
[02:26:36.741 --> 02:26:48.803]  Into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations.
[02:26:49.743 --> 02:26:52.504]  Its preparations are concealed, not published.
[02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:55.724]  Its mistakes are buried, not headlined.
[02:26:56.504 --> 02:26:59.165]  Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.
[02:26:59.965 --> 02:27:01.405]  No expenditure is questioned.
[02:27:01.965 --> 02:27:02.966]  No rumor is printed.
[02:27:03.686 --> 02:27:04.866]  No secret is revealed.
[02:27:05.805 --> 02:27:07.666]  It conducts the Cold War in short.
[02:27:08.407 --> 02:27:13.751]  With a wartime discipline, no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.
[02:27:14.872 --> 02:27:21.317]  Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security.
[02:27:21.577 --> 02:27:21.917]  All right.
[02:27:22.278 --> 02:27:27.341]  And the question remains... I just wanted to play the part about the secret societies and secrecy not being an American value.
[02:27:27.361 --> 02:27:27.802]  We'll come back.
[02:27:27.822 --> 02:27:29.043]  I'm going to comment on that speech.
[02:27:29.835 --> 02:27:35.402]  And then we'll get to some of your calls at 800-259-9231 and cover some other news items as well.
[02:27:36.584 --> 02:27:37.465]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.966 --> 02:27:39.568]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.588 --> 02:27:43.173]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.846 --> 02:27:49.188]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:49.428 --> 02:27:51.490]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:51.630 --> 02:27:58.675]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.

[02:28:46.201 --> 02:28:48.162]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:48.262 --> 02:28:58.968]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:59.348 --> 02:29:03.871]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.931 --> 02:29:15.277]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.857 --> 02:29:22.705]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:23.105 --> 02:29:25.248]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.748 --> 02:29:30.694]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[02:29:30.994 --> 02:29:37.759]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:41.582]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:41.803 --> 02:29:45.425]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.586 --> 02:29:50.649]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want the milk.
[02:29:50.850 --> 02:29:54.252]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:54.432 --> 02:29:57.875]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:58.163 --> 02:30:01.406]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:01.426 --> 02:30:06.911]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:06.931 --> 02:30:16.560]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:18.061]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:18.081 --> 02:30:23.486]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:23.963 --> 02:30:28.406]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:28.426 --> 02:30:29.867]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:30.027 --> 02:30:33.850]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:34.770]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:55.447 --> 02:30:56.788]  We're good to go.
[02:30:56.828 --> 02:30:57.029]  I think?
[02:31:14.514 --> 02:31:16.735]  Tear the CIA into a thousand pieces.
[02:31:16.775 --> 02:31:17.755]  We're getting out of Vietnam.
[02:31:17.795 --> 02:31:23.836]  He signed an executive order to stop printing Federal Reserve notes, start issuing Lincoln Greenbacks, U.S.
[02:31:23.876 --> 02:31:24.136]  notes.
[02:31:24.556 --> 02:31:26.077]  You can even buy those at coin shops.
[02:31:27.197 --> 02:31:28.697]  Little $5 bills that say U.S.
[02:31:28.717 --> 02:31:29.137]  note on them.
[02:31:29.638 --> 02:31:33.939]  And he thought about Operation Northwoods and exposed it and wouldn't go along with it.
[02:31:35.039 --> 02:31:38.160]  But notice he talked about how the government isn't above the law.
[02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:39.900]  But Bush says he's above the law.
[02:31:40.774 --> 02:31:56.341]  We talked about freedom of the press, but Bush is saying we need to start arresting New York Times reporters that report on torture, or that report on massacres, or that report on planting WMDs, or trying to plant WMDs.
[02:31:56.962 --> 02:32:01.484]  We have prosecutors who are moral people in the case of Southern California.
[02:32:02.961 --> 02:32:06.262]  Blows the whistle about police lying on stand falsifying evidence.
[02:32:06.302 --> 02:32:11.343]  He gets fired over it, goes to the Supreme Court, and they say, no, you're not allowed to whistleblow on corruption.
[02:32:13.463 --> 02:32:21.325]  We have all of these rulings taking place, all of these things that reverse everything that makes the United States the apple of the world's eye.
[02:32:21.565 --> 02:32:29.407]  We're going from the freest country to one that more and more resembles third world dictatorships and oligarchies and plutocracies.
[02:32:30.871 --> 02:32:32.972]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff.
[02:32:34.052 --> 02:32:35.353]  Jeff in California.
[02:32:35.373 --> 02:32:36.473]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:32:37.053 --> 02:32:37.573]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:32:37.613 --> 02:32:43.796]  I wanted to make just a brief comment about the JFK deal and then go into the real reason for my call.
[02:32:44.256 --> 02:32:45.837]  You know, you're exactly right, Alex.
[02:32:46.677 --> 02:32:53.980]  John F. Kennedy stated, well, there were several things that filled the CIA with rage and the CIA, the cocaine import agency.
[02:32:54.840 --> 02:33:00.562]  JFK stated, I'm going to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the wind
[02:33:01.058 --> 02:33:13.527]  And, of course, again, there were several things that filled the CIA with rage, which he was going to investigate all the CIA crimes, fire the CIA director, limit their operation under Memorandum 55, and several other things.
[02:33:13.607 --> 02:33:15.148]  Get rid of the FBI director?
[02:33:15.788 --> 02:33:16.809]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:33:16.849 --> 02:33:17.830]  You're exactly right.
[02:33:18.390 --> 02:33:21.452]  And, you know, that was one of the reasons they assassinated him.
[02:33:21.993 --> 02:33:25.435]  And, of course, they used several patches to accomplish their mission.
[02:33:25.756 --> 02:33:29.158]  But, Alex, the reason I was calling, I know you do a lot of investigative things, and
[02:33:29.665 --> 02:33:38.531]  You know, recently the leader from Japan visited with President Bush, and this is what I gather from that.
[02:33:41.052 --> 02:33:58.503]  Some of my people, information sources, told me that, you know, Japan has inexpensive licensing of low-power city and neighborhood range radio and TV stations, and, of course, local communities around the country have been excluded from the air by national broadcasters.
[02:33:59.013 --> 02:34:06.576]  And the FCC has recently enacted new regulations to allow low-power neighborhood broadcasting up to seven miles.
[02:34:06.836 --> 02:34:07.096]  Yes.
[02:34:07.557 --> 02:34:26.865]  And what I wanted to find out... Now, I think this is good for America, but according to some of my sources, the reason President Bush had this meeting was he's basically contemplating with General Hayden and Robert Mueller to use these radio stations to...
[02:34:28.055 --> 02:34:34.377]  To spread hate, or ideas of hate, I should say, and propaganda to the American people.
[02:34:34.397 --> 02:34:35.417]  What do you think about that?
[02:34:35.497 --> 02:34:37.498]  Okay, let me try to answer that question.
[02:34:37.538 --> 02:34:38.678]  Thanks for the call, Jeff.
[02:34:41.399 --> 02:34:56.203]  The Japanese Prime Minister was here talking about a bunch of trade issues, North Korea, they visited Elvis' house, Graceland, and Japan's got some local TV and radio, but there's no connection between
[02:34:56.728 --> 02:35:05.089]  And Bush has Fox News, CNN, ABC, NBC, most of the big talk shows, so they certainly don't want low power.
[02:35:05.822 --> 02:35:07.103]  That has nothing to do with it.
[02:35:08.063 --> 02:35:12.665]  Low-power community stations would be for local organizations, local communities.
[02:35:13.066 --> 02:35:18.088]  Certainly there would be a socialist and neocons that would get the stations, but then others could do it.
[02:35:18.128 --> 02:35:24.831]  And then what's happening all over the country is patriots, freedom lovers, are just ignoring that, and they're going with their own micros without licensing.
[02:35:25.191 --> 02:35:32.255]  They're not interfering with anybody, and they're reaching from a mile to 20 miles, and in some cases even further, and doing a great job.
[02:35:32.375 --> 02:35:32.555]  So...
[02:35:33.354 --> 02:35:35.616]  I've seen no evidence of that.
[02:35:35.756 --> 02:35:36.637]  Interesting phone call.
[02:35:37.397 --> 02:35:38.919]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:35:38.999 --> 02:35:39.879]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:35:41.261 --> 02:35:41.841]  Hello, Alex.
[02:35:42.141 --> 02:35:42.422]  Hi.
[02:35:42.602 --> 02:35:45.864]  You know, some salient questions I wanted to ask your guests.
[02:35:46.085 --> 02:35:54.732]  First off, why were foreign law enforcement brought onto American territory to participate in a raid against an American citizen?
[02:35:54.752 --> 02:35:57.534]  For those that just joined us, Ron, why don't you recap what we talked about?
[02:35:58.519 --> 02:36:06.145]  Yes, what had happened was there was a gentleman by the name of, I'm not sure I'm mispronouncing it, Salata, is that correct, Mr. Salata, in the state of Montana?
[02:36:06.165 --> 02:36:08.387]  Mr. Richard Salata in Dillon, Montana.
[02:36:09.728 --> 02:36:14.832]  And Mr. Salata had distributed some of your materials to his local sheriff.
[02:36:16.013 --> 02:36:24.700]  From there, that set on a chain of events, obviously, where the local sheriff felt that your materials were subversive, which they're not, but that was the opinion of this
[02:36:25.347 --> 02:36:27.407]  I guess maladjusted sheriff in Montana.
[02:36:27.688 --> 02:36:33.309]  He then called in federal law enforcement, as it turns out, based on that belief.
[02:36:33.929 --> 02:36:41.510]  And as it turns out, Mr. Slaughter also conducts a business where he sells kits for people to construct their own firearms.
[02:36:42.351 --> 02:36:43.931]  Which is completely legal, by the way.
[02:36:45.411 --> 02:36:48.792]  And the ATF, I believe in conjunction with the FBI,
[02:36:49.611 --> 02:36:58.516]  And more curiously, in conjunction with Canadian law enforcement officials, raided Mr. Salata's home slash business in Montana.
[02:36:59.957 --> 02:37:03.719]  They confiscated his materials, his kits that he sells.
[02:37:04.279 --> 02:37:08.802]  They confiscated and damaged his computer to some degree or extent.
[02:37:09.803 --> 02:37:13.705]  And from there, basically, Mr. Salata is now in a legal quandary.
[02:37:14.454 --> 02:37:20.083]  Merely because it all starts out, the root of this is he expressed his right to free speech.
[02:37:21.545 --> 02:37:26.614]  And then from there we've had a chain reaction of one illegal act after another.
[02:37:28.024 --> 02:37:30.625]  I think that pretty much characterized what happened.
[02:37:31.546 --> 02:37:39.930]  And this has added to the huge growing pile of confirmed cases where this has happened for Ron Paul videos, Pocket Constitutions, my films.
[02:37:39.970 --> 02:37:43.692]  I mean, this has been in major newspapers that this goes on.
[02:37:43.732 --> 02:37:44.592]  They arrest people.
[02:37:44.632 --> 02:37:47.154]  They take them to trial calling it hate.
[02:37:47.234 --> 02:37:48.994]  I mean, this is happening.
[02:37:49.475 --> 02:37:51.996]  First off, you know, still the question is outstanding.
[02:37:52.535 --> 02:37:58.356]  Why were foreign law enforcement officials brought onto American territory to assist with the arrest of an American citizen?
[02:37:59.717 --> 02:38:04.458]  Secondly, another question is, what are the other relevant organizations doing?
[02:38:04.518 --> 02:38:14.620]  I know he has GOA, and I believe Jews for the Preservation of Firearms on his side, but where is the ACLU and the National Rifle Association in this matter?
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:16.661]  Well, you know you're not going to find the ACLU there.
[02:38:16.701 --> 02:38:18.381]  They cherry-pick what rights they support.
[02:38:19.361 --> 02:38:25.586]  Yeah, and they tend to cherry-pick cases which are not in conjunction, I'd say, with many cases anyway.
[02:38:25.606 --> 02:38:25.946]  That's right.
[02:38:25.986 --> 02:38:30.690]  They defend rights that don't exist while attacking, in many cases, the very bedrock rights.
[02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:34.672]  And help to create bad case law that wind up really ruining the situation.
[02:38:34.692 --> 02:38:35.253]  That's another thing.
[02:38:35.273 --> 02:38:36.794]  They lose cases on purpose, yes.
[02:38:36.814 --> 02:38:38.675]  So does the NRA.
[02:38:38.715 --> 02:38:41.097]  The NRA seems to be pretty much in the same bag.
[02:38:41.678 --> 02:38:43.299]  I ask that question satirically.
[02:38:44.016 --> 02:38:48.500]  But anyone who's familiar with your materials and your statements will know.
[02:38:48.540 --> 02:38:52.183]  Justin, we haven't confirmed it, but we're told that NRA has offered support.
[02:38:52.697 --> 02:38:53.777]  Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[02:38:53.817 --> 02:39:08.580]  I've got to say, there was a shake-up a few years ago at NRA, and they're not perfect, but they've gone from being absolutely anti-gun, actually arguing in federal court that we don't have a full Second Amendment, funding gun laws, supporting gun laws in Texas and Illinois.
[02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:12.001]  They've changed direction, kind of like the John Birch Society.
[02:39:12.261 --> 02:39:13.861]  They've changed maybe 20 degrees.
[02:39:13.881 --> 02:39:17.562]  I mean, they're not perfect, but you can see them making the turn.
[02:39:17.842 --> 02:39:20.683]  As long as the turn is continuing, it looks a lot better.
[02:39:21.083 --> 02:39:22.183]  Well, let's hope that
[02:39:22.697 --> 02:39:32.242]  They have made a genuine offer of help that's more of an effort to integrate with his defense to assist him rather than to infiltrate his defense and undercut him.
[02:39:32.762 --> 02:39:34.283]  Let's just hope that that's the end result.
[02:39:34.383 --> 02:39:36.284]  But there isn't even a defense.
[02:39:36.644 --> 02:39:37.484]  They didn't charge him.
[02:39:37.504 --> 02:39:38.705]  They just grabbed his stuff.
[02:39:38.845 --> 02:39:39.985]  Well, how could they charge him?
[02:39:40.045 --> 02:39:47.189]  Anyone familiar with your materials will know that basically your materials, by and large, are a compilation...
[02:39:48.223 --> 02:39:58.411]  Of news stories from some of the most foremost periodicals, NewsWires, UPI, Newsweek, NBC.
[02:39:59.032 --> 02:40:03.235]  Basically what you do is parlay all this information together and put it in your videos.
[02:40:03.475 --> 02:40:08.680]  Yeah, we try to paint a big picture, connect the dots, and then pick up on the stories that they ignore.
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:10.441]  I mean, take Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:40:10.761 --> 02:40:14.925]  There's a case in there, and it's the front page of the Milwaukee Journal paper.
[02:40:15.485 --> 02:40:19.568]  And it says the guy was in a wheelchair, a vet, no criminal record.
[02:40:19.849 --> 02:40:21.930]  They were taking his 40 acres of prime real estate.
[02:40:21.970 --> 02:40:22.771]  They weren't going to pay him.
[02:40:23.131 --> 02:40:24.452]  He sued the people doing it.
[02:40:24.753 --> 02:40:27.014]  And they came and arrested him and said, you're not allowed to sue us.
[02:40:27.054 --> 02:40:27.995]  We're taking your property.
[02:40:28.275 --> 02:40:32.018]  And you're going to serve, I think it was seven years in prison, for paper terrorism.
[02:40:33.459 --> 02:40:36.482]  I mean, there's 45 seconds of that three-hour film.
[02:40:36.962 --> 02:40:38.644]  Well, the fact remains this.
[02:40:39.324 --> 02:40:42.767]  Certainly, if your material is subversive, and it is not,
[02:40:43.351 --> 02:40:51.753]  And Michael, more videos are subversive because your material is no more or less at the same, let us say, tone or tenor than his.
[02:40:52.533 --> 02:40:55.994]  However, in neither case is the material subversive.
[02:40:56.074 --> 02:41:06.816]  Subversion, this is an issue we visited a long time ago in the 1950s during the McCarthy era, and there's been ruling after ruling after ruling from the highest court since.
[02:41:07.456 --> 02:41:08.216]  Subversion is...
[02:41:09.016 --> 02:41:13.058]  Is a very narrowly defined definition.
[02:41:13.519 --> 02:41:14.639]  And I mean most narrow.
[02:41:14.659 --> 02:41:16.520]  Let me tell you what subversion is.
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:25.405]  Subversion would be if I went to the home of a ICBM MX missile battery captain.
[02:41:26.026 --> 02:41:28.107]  And I went to his home and I knocked on his door.
[02:41:28.867 --> 02:41:33.629]  And I said, here's $10,000 to not launch those missiles when you're ordered to.
[02:41:33.729 --> 02:41:34.989]  That is subversion.
[02:41:35.129 --> 02:41:37.450]  Let me even define it down more clearly.
[02:41:37.530 --> 02:41:40.692]  I think most of your audience will be able to digest this more easily.
[02:41:41.492 --> 02:41:52.596]  Subversion is very implicitly, very directly advocating the use of violence, the use of violence against the governmental order.
[02:41:53.582 --> 02:42:02.877]  Advocating the undermining of the defense very implicitly, in the way you've just described, of the national security.
[02:42:03.337 --> 02:42:08.085]  You have never, at any time, that I have listened to you in all these years...
[02:42:08.786 --> 02:42:12.907]  Edva advocated anything like that, and your films do not reflect that.
[02:42:12.947 --> 02:42:13.367]  Well, the opposite.
[02:42:13.467 --> 02:42:19.389]  The Republican and Democrats are getting rid of the sovereignty, signing it over, getting rid of the borders, getting rid of our trade laws.
[02:42:19.529 --> 02:42:20.589]  They are subverting.
[02:42:20.909 --> 02:42:23.250]  They are engaged in classical subversion.
[02:42:23.610 --> 02:42:36.273]  Well, when you have American law enforcement agencies, on top of all the other wrongs that they perpetrated against this man, invite foreign law enforcement entities onto American territory...
[02:42:36.932 --> 02:42:48.304]  To raid and knock down the door of an American citizen, I think a very good argument could be posed for that until they could come up with a reason as to why Canadian authorities were invited to be there.
[02:42:49.806 --> 02:42:55.892]  So the question here, right, they've switched or turned the situation.
[02:42:56.536 --> 02:42:59.078]  By focusing on this man when he's done nothing illegal.
[02:42:59.218 --> 02:43:02.280]  We want them to stop subverting our country, okay?
[02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:05.483]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, is what the country is based on.
[02:43:05.503 --> 02:43:06.564]  It is the heart of the nation.
[02:43:06.604 --> 02:43:07.484]  It's what makes the U.S.
[02:43:07.504 --> 02:43:08.025]  the U.S.
[02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:09.486]  They are overthrowing that.
[02:43:09.626 --> 02:43:10.486]  They are subverting.
[02:43:10.747 --> 02:43:11.447]  It is sedition.
[02:43:11.467 --> 02:43:12.108]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:12.568 --> 02:43:13.449]  I appreciate it, Ron.
[02:43:13.469 --> 02:43:14.189]  Good to hear from you.
[02:43:14.209 --> 02:43:15.910]  I've got to move quick here.
[02:43:15.930 --> 02:43:16.931]  Of course, you have a load of phone lines.
[02:43:16.971 --> 02:43:17.792]  I want to talk to everybody.
[02:43:17.832 --> 02:43:19.833]  I've got a few news items I want to hit, too.
[02:43:20.894 --> 02:43:23.456]  Let's talk to George in Indiana.
[02:43:23.496 --> 02:43:24.377]  George, you're on the air.
[02:43:24.417 --> 02:43:24.777]  Go ahead.
[02:43:26.765 --> 02:43:27.386]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:43:27.626 --> 02:43:28.627]  I've listened to you a lot.
[02:43:28.667 --> 02:43:29.407]  I watch your movies.
[02:43:29.447 --> 02:43:30.248]  I really enjoy it.
[02:43:30.988 --> 02:43:35.992]  There's something, though, in me watching these shows over and over.
[02:43:36.672 --> 02:43:38.233]  I wanted to get your opinion on this.
[02:43:38.733 --> 02:43:43.817]  What if those planes that hit the Twin Towers was loaded with thermite?
[02:43:43.937 --> 02:43:49.501]  Wouldn't that kind of explain why there were pools of liquid metal in the bottom of the buildings?
[02:43:50.908 --> 02:43:56.651]  Thermite has to be ignited in a specific way, and it was done pillar by pillar.
[02:43:56.691 --> 02:44:02.214]  We even have the cut pillars cut at the exact angle that the patented thermate, again, not just thermite.
[02:44:02.294 --> 02:44:18.682]  When they tested it, it's the specific derivatives and signature of the exact type that they use for cutting on pillars, and it was cut at the exact angle from the pieces we photographed in the rubble that day that you would place the thermite cutting charges.
[02:44:19.002 --> 02:44:23.124]  And that would in itself be enough in order to cause pools of liquid metal?
[02:44:24.204 --> 02:44:30.947]  Yes, because there was so much thermite used, and the metal melts and precipitates in the footprint of the collapsed structure.
[02:44:31.367 --> 02:44:31.647]  I see.
[02:44:32.428 --> 02:44:36.410]  One other statement I want to make, and then I'll let you go, because I think this is kind of interesting.
[02:44:37.410 --> 02:44:46.674]  In Ezekiel in the Bible, it talks about the war that's going to happen between Gog and Magog over in Israel, and it says something about burning the weapons for seven years.
[02:44:47.353 --> 02:44:51.196]  And I did a little research and I found there's a product called Lignostone.
[02:44:51.716 --> 02:45:06.065]  It's made of beach, but it repels radar and also radiation and all of the weaponry of the countries that are over there involved line their tanks, their vehicles and stuff with this stuff and it'll burn like coal.
[02:45:06.166 --> 02:45:06.746]  It's very hot.
[02:45:08.107 --> 02:45:11.971]  And it's L-I-G-N-O-S-T-O-N-E for anybody that's interested in looking into that.
[02:45:12.211 --> 02:45:12.632]  Interesting.
[02:45:12.672 --> 02:45:13.633]  Thank you for the call.
[02:45:14.013 --> 02:45:17.877]  Let's talk to Paul in Vancouver, Canada.
[02:45:17.917 --> 02:45:18.578]  You're on the air.
[02:45:18.598 --> 02:45:20.059]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:21.381]  I won't be long here.
[02:45:21.401 --> 02:45:22.762]  I know you don't have much time.
[02:45:24.102 --> 02:45:25.403]  I know you've been really busy lately.
[02:45:25.443 --> 02:45:27.345]  I just wanted to raise a few issues.
[02:45:28.867 --> 02:45:33.432]  First of all, the NASCAR Corridor website, they've actually quoted your words on there.
[02:45:33.452 --> 02:45:35.614]  I suggest you guys check it out.
[02:45:35.634 --> 02:45:38.457]  It says, Debunking the Myths, and they actually quote you on there.
[02:45:39.685 --> 02:45:40.646]  Wait a minute.
[02:45:40.806 --> 02:45:45.609]  So now one of the big NAFTA corridor government websites is saying I'm a liar?
[02:45:45.949 --> 02:45:46.570]  Well, no.
[02:45:46.590 --> 02:45:56.076]  They don't use your name, but they quote the phrase 400-yard... I don't know if those are your words, the 400-yard-wide highway.
[02:45:56.276 --> 02:46:01.179]  Well, we have their own documents, so the fact that they lie is really...
[02:46:01.994 --> 02:46:03.455]  I mean, that's what we expect from these people.
[02:46:03.475 --> 02:46:04.516]  Yeah, and that's what they put.
[02:46:04.576 --> 02:46:05.717]  It says, Debunking the Myths.
[02:46:05.757 --> 02:46:07.539]  You can check it out at NASCARQuarter.com.
[02:46:07.599 --> 02:46:18.187]  Also, I know you haven't had a chance to report all the news because there's just so much, but another piece of interest is the Verichip.
[02:46:18.308 --> 02:46:22.451]  They're talking with hospitals right now, ADSX on the NASDAQ.
[02:46:22.491 --> 02:46:23.172]  They're talking with...
[02:46:24.532 --> 02:46:24.952]  It is.
[02:46:24.992 --> 02:46:25.293]  It is crazy.
[02:46:25.313 --> 02:46:29.174]  And I had one more issue to bring up, and it's just slipped my mind, so I guess I'll just leave it at that.
[02:46:29.194 --> 02:46:30.575]  Hey, good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:46:30.595 --> 02:46:32.796]  I really appreciate it.
[02:46:32.896 --> 02:46:34.557]  Who was up after that call from Canada?
[02:46:54.998 --> 02:46:57.200]  Rhonda, another call from Vancouver.
[02:46:57.220 --> 02:46:58.000]  Rhonda, go ahead.
[02:46:58.801 --> 02:46:59.502]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[02:46:59.582 --> 02:47:01.463]  It's such a joy and an honor to talk to you.
[02:47:01.623 --> 02:47:02.484]  Honor to talk to you.
[02:47:02.944 --> 02:47:13.192]  Well, why I called today is the North American Union has been fast-forwarded, and now they're looking at 2007 rather than 2010.
[02:47:14.313 --> 02:47:21.879]  And I'm actually a member of the Canadian Action Party, and I just think it would be absolutely awesome if you could get our leader, Constance Fogel, on.
[02:47:22.406 --> 02:47:27.167]  She's a lawyer, and she heads our party, and she doesn't use sensationalism.
[02:47:27.587 --> 02:47:33.549]  She just talks in a legal manner, and she spells out exactly how the Canadian government and the U.S.
[02:47:33.769 --> 02:47:38.830]  is sneaking this through so that people are not aware of exactly what's happening.
[02:47:39.450 --> 02:47:44.051]  And she's been in touch with Jerome Corsi lately, and he's been trying to get her some speaking engagements.
[02:47:44.711 --> 02:47:46.052]  Well, good.
[02:47:46.172 --> 02:47:49.433]  Email us, Ryan at Infowars.com, Kevin at Infowars.com.
[02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:51.273]  Email us at contactinfo.
[02:47:51.963 --> 02:47:52.863]  Absolutely, I will.
[02:47:52.903 --> 02:47:54.464]  And thank you for all your hard work.
[02:47:54.964 --> 02:47:56.445]  You're just, uh, you're my hero.
[02:47:56.865 --> 02:47:59.386]  Well, no, please, I'm just doing my job.
[02:47:59.466 --> 02:47:59.786]  Thank you.
[02:47:59.806 --> 02:48:00.687]  I appreciate the call.
[02:48:01.147 --> 02:48:04.248]  Speaking of sensationalism, we can't help this being sensational.
[02:48:04.308 --> 02:48:08.110]  I mean, Lou Dobbs getting up and saying, America as we know it is now ending.
[02:48:09.010 --> 02:48:10.631]  That is sensational, but it's the truth.
[02:48:11.591 --> 02:48:15.072]  You know, that the government openly says they want to confiscate our guns and our own documents.
[02:48:15.092 --> 02:48:15.773]  We have them.
[02:48:15.813 --> 02:48:16.393]  We've posted them.
[02:48:16.433 --> 02:48:16.913]  We've covered it.
[02:48:17.193 --> 02:48:18.674]  That is sensational, but it's true.
[02:48:19.617 --> 02:48:26.643]  The fact that they're trying to make the population all over the world take microchips and that they're constantly promoting it is sensational.
[02:48:27.503 --> 02:48:32.908]  The fact that they put mercury and cancer viruses in most vaccines is sensational, but it's true.
[02:48:34.149 --> 02:48:38.292]  The fact that our government carried out 9-11 is sensational, but it's true.
[02:48:39.132 --> 02:48:40.954]  And yes, this show is sensational.
[02:48:41.795 --> 02:48:43.136]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:48:43.556 --> 02:48:44.777]  Life is sensational.
[02:48:47.441 --> 02:48:50.305]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.545 --> 02:48:51.246]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:51.346 --> 02:48:52.127]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.468 --> 02:48:57.154]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.494 --> 02:49:04.243]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.503 --> 02:49:04.924]  We're good to go.
[02:49:22.842 --> 02:49:24.384]  Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[02:49:24.444 --> 02:49:25.244]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:25.264 --> 02:49:27.046]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:46.758 --> 02:49:50.660]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:56.322]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:56.602 --> 02:50:06.967]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:07.147 --> 02:50:11.468]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:11.669 --> 02:50:15.210]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:20.013]  Benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:20.293 --> 02:50:26.657]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:50:26.777 --> 02:50:31.260]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:31.460 --> 02:50:35.682]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:50:35.942 --> 02:50:40.505]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:40.525 --> 02:50:40.725]  That's 888
[02:50:43.527 --> 02:50:44.028]  We're good to go.
[02:50:44.068 --> 02:50:44.248]  I think?
[02:51:03.451 --> 02:51:04.071]  I think so too.
[02:51:18.959 --> 02:51:19.299]  We're good to go.
[02:51:49.608 --> 02:51:59.258]  National British Television is now reporting that the evidence is pretty conclusive and there's an investigation being started up by a member of Parliament into the murder of Dr. David Kelly.
[02:51:59.679 --> 02:52:01.681]  I meant to get to that today.
[02:52:01.761 --> 02:52:05.725]  We will attempt to do that tomorrow and play part of that newscast here.
[02:52:05.745 --> 02:52:06.746]  Sorry we didn't get to it.
[02:52:08.163 --> 02:52:17.767]  I've got a whole stack of quotes and clips here from Fox Television where they have a full court press now to bring back a, quote, office of censorship to censor and control the media.
[02:52:18.327 --> 02:52:19.687]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[02:52:20.168 --> 02:52:22.368]  And Kurt Nemo has put a lot of these quotes together.
[02:52:24.229 --> 02:52:31.452]  Some of the different Fox shows, Fox and Friends and others, openly calling for shutting down free speech in the United States.
[02:52:32.930 --> 02:52:33.811]  Interesting story.
[02:52:33.851 --> 02:52:37.354]  You know, people always freak out over nuclear reactors, and they should be set up properly.
[02:52:37.394 --> 02:52:39.056]  They should be built correctly.
[02:52:39.096 --> 02:52:40.317]  They should be inspected.
[02:52:40.337 --> 02:52:43.840]  I think nuclear power, though, is a great idea overall.
[02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:45.902]  We have plenty of fossil fuels.
[02:52:46.502 --> 02:52:47.263]  Why not use them?
[02:52:47.283 --> 02:52:53.288]  Well, the oil companies don't want that to happen, so they actually funded the anti-nuclear parties in this country and worldwide to try to shut it down.
[02:52:53.328 --> 02:52:56.571]  But France gets 80-plus percent of its power from nuclear power plants.
[02:52:56.591 --> 02:52:57.332]  So does Japan.
[02:52:58.313 --> 02:52:59.293]  That cuts out the big boys.
[02:52:59.313 --> 02:52:59.814]  They don't like it.
[02:53:00.436 --> 02:53:05.240]  But something I am worried about is the transport of nuclear weapons and nuclear material in 18-wheelers.
[02:53:06.341 --> 02:53:12.906]  Growing up in Texas, I saw a lot of the big 18-wheelers, and you can tell because they're always shielded, and they have a specific look.
[02:53:12.926 --> 02:53:27.598]  And I've talked to family that worked on Air Force bases who pointed it out when I was a child, that 18-wheelers carrying nuclear weapons will normally also have a nondescript vehicle following it with troops in it, that is, security forces in it.
[02:53:28.098 --> 02:53:29.099]  But this is a big problem.
[02:53:29.159 --> 02:53:33.182]  An AFP has reported Britain's nuclear warheads could be triggered by road crash.
[02:53:33.203 --> 02:53:35.945]  A new scientist originally reported on this.
[02:53:36.565 --> 02:53:47.155]  And it says Britain's Triton nuclear warheads could be partially detonated in a road pileup or plane crash, unleashing lethal doses of radiation, the British weekly news scientist said on Wednesday.
[02:53:48.095 --> 02:53:49.497]  So this is the real threat.
[02:53:50.017 --> 02:53:52.679]  And finally we're hearing about a real threat in the news.
[02:53:52.779 --> 02:53:55.542]  So bravo to that.
[02:53:57.066 --> 02:54:02.290]  Le Mode Diplomate, one of the biggest publications in France, headline, 9-11, an inside job.
[02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:10.475]  That is the headline, and it mentions us and a lot of others, and so that's certainly some good news, and it's a fair article, at least from the English translation that I've read.
[02:54:12.776 --> 02:54:13.497]  I am out of time.
[02:54:13.577 --> 02:54:19.161]  A lot of the news we didn't get to is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.net, JonesReport.com.
[02:54:20.479 --> 02:54:24.561]  My new film, Terror Storm, is up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:24.641 --> 02:54:25.701]  Fifteen cents a day.
[02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:27.262]  A monthly membership is $5.95.
[02:54:27.422 --> 02:54:28.863]  Get a yearly membership.
[02:54:28.883 --> 02:54:29.783]  Get three months free.
[02:54:30.183 --> 02:54:31.764]  But go get the one-month membership.
[02:54:31.824 --> 02:54:34.265]  You can download and burn copies of all 15 of my films.
[02:54:34.585 --> 02:54:37.426]  There are dozens and dozens of other films that we've been authorized to post there.
[02:54:37.466 --> 02:54:43.489]  My book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, special in-studio reports, reports we've done from Crawford, Texas.
[02:54:43.889 --> 02:54:44.409]  We're good to go.
[02:55:12.365 --> 02:55:15.467]  On prisonplanet.tv this weekend.
[02:55:15.787 --> 02:55:19.070]  And we've got our people working around the clock to put some of it up on Google.
[02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:22.072]  If you want to help us listeners, as soon as it goes up, go grab it.
[02:55:22.112 --> 02:55:24.994]  You put it on Google Video or break it up and put it on YouTube.
[02:55:25.054 --> 02:55:25.954]  We just can't do it all.
[02:55:27.435 --> 02:55:29.257]  You know, by midnight, my people have got to go home.
[02:55:29.397 --> 02:55:31.138]  And I encourage them to go home even earlier than that.
[02:55:31.158 --> 02:55:32.939]  We've got to hire more people or something.
[02:55:32.959 --> 02:55:34.180]  We've got to make more money to do that.
[02:55:35.365 --> 02:55:39.808]  We only got a few copies left of the emergency release of Terror Storm without the extras.
