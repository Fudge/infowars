[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:06.221]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:07.942]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:09.762]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:11.223]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:12.903]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:17.345]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:21.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.428 --> 00:00:26.308]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:26.348 --> 00:00:27.749]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:30.584]  It is the 28th day of August.
[00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:35.388]  2006 will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.574]  Coming up in about 15-20 minutes, we've got Paul Joseph Watson with a big news blitz.
[00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:52.201]  A whole bunch of different news items coming up, including a very popular rock and roll band in the United Kingdom that live on BBC television.
[00:00:53.172 --> 00:01:01.616]  We're basically exposing 9-11 for being an inside job in the best way they could by wearing a t-shirt that said, Terror Storm.
[00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:13.442]  And then when the press asked them about it, they responded by simply stating that they needed to go to Google Video and type Terror Storm in, and it would be a real treat for them.
[00:01:14.102 --> 00:01:17.944]  We have Patrick J. Buchanan, who's been on the show three or four times over the years.
[00:01:18.384 --> 00:01:22.146]  He's going to be joining us, he's scheduled to, in the third hour.
[00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:35.850]  His new book, State of Emergency, and Les Jamieson that heads up New York 9-11 Truth, a great American patriot, he's going to be joining us to talk about some of the latest 9-11 revelations coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:43.774]  In the meantime, Washington Post doesn't answer why no Bin Laden 9-1-1 indictment.
[00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:52.499]  That's right, he's been taken off the most wanted list and there's never been an indictment of him and now they've closed the office that's quote, hunting for him.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.648]  Number three at the CIA, Buzzy Krongard, said two years ago to the Times of London that the government, quote, doesn't want to catch him.
[00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.933]  But you tell the average American this, they will just roll their eyes and deny that it's really happening.
[00:02:08.237 --> 00:02:12.719]  Washington Post doesn't answer why no Bin Laden 9-1-1 indictment.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:26.747]  WhiteWashPeace seeks to dismiss questions about FBI Most Wanted page but doesn't address why embassy incident took three months yet no 9-1-1 charge after five years.
[00:02:26.827 --> 00:02:29.709]  Paul Watson will be discussing this with us.
[00:02:31.394 --> 00:02:33.916]  I mentioned this earlier, but let me just tell you a little bit about it now.
[00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:38.980]  Rock frontman invites viewing millions to see Alex Jones' new movie.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.166]  Muse singer Scrawls Name of Terror Storm on t-shirt performs headlining show at Reading Festival.
[00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:49.348]  That's one of the biggest music festivals in England.
[00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:56.654]  Critically acclaimed rockers Muse cited Alex Jones' new film as one of their influences as frontman Matt
[00:02:57.558 --> 00:03:07.508]  Bellamy, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly, scrawled Terror Storm on the back of his shirt for the band's Saturday night headline gig at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.
[00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.892]  A lot of courage by these guys to do this.
[00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:17.178]  I found out walking in this morning that a lot of my staff here at the office are fans of Muse.
[00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:27.321]  But really this is just an issue of courage what they've done going public and of course I'm sorry I missed their call on Friday.
[00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.383]  I've now learned they called on Friday.
[00:03:29.403 --> 00:03:41.154]  I had already left Friday morning and we were closing up shop here Friday afternoon for the rest of my crew to travel to Dallas and so we were unable to call the Muse
[00:03:43.059 --> 00:04:10.079]  The problem is we're a very small operation and we get hundreds of calls a day, thousands of emails, hundreds of letters, and I don't want to discourage anybody from calling us or emailing us or writing us because we want to read through it, we want to contact you, we want to talk to you, we want to reach out to people.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.504]  I just am horrified of how many important phone calls I've probably missed or emails that have bounced back over the years.
[00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:23.449]  Charlie Sheen was trying to get in touch with me for weeks and weeks before he was ever even able to.
[00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:33.216]  Just another example of how we are totally overwhelmed here and I've got to, I guess, get bigger offices and try to organize something in a coherent fashion.
[00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:35.938]  We're doing a pretty good job, but it's all out of control.
[00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.640]  The good news is, 9-11 truth is exponentially exploding.
[00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:45.161]  And a lot of good things are happening.
[00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:47.942]  And we'll try to cover it all on the other side.
[00:04:48.102 --> 00:04:49.022]  I'm a bit exhausted.
[00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.383]  It was an exhausting weekend.
[00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:55.844]  I'll tell you about some of the things that happened in Dallas and a lot more when we get back.
[00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:07.769]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.069]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:18.091]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:25.812]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:29.153]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:31.854]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:33.074]  NSA spying.
[00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:37.686]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.947 --> 00:05:41.449]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.810]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.073]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:06.761]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:20.193]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.

[00:06:24.256 --> 00:06:33.624]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:06:33.864 --> 00:06:37.386]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:07:01.593 --> 00:07:04.074]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:06.556]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:13.700]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.562]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:17.242 --> 00:07:20.764]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:21.324 --> 00:07:25.467]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:26.027 --> 00:07:28.989]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.972 --> 00:07:32.893]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:39.635]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:42.716]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:42.956 --> 00:07:46.378]  For the following two free reports.
[00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:47.538]  U.S.
[00:07:47.618 --> 00:07:50.559]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:53.800]  Call 888-Xanadu.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.041]  That's 888-Xanadu.
[00:07:58.382 --> 00:07:59.342]  And ask for George.
[00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:07.119]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:21.850]  All right, we are scheduled to have Pat Buchanan with his book that's already raced to number one on the New York Times bestseller list, that is State of Emergency, the Third World Invasion and Conquest of America.
[00:08:23.234 --> 00:08:27.076]  Les Jamieson of 9-11 New York Truth will be joining us in the second hour.
[00:08:27.096 --> 00:08:28.016]  We'll have open phones.
[00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:33.419]  Paul Watson joins us in the next segment for two segments to go over a whole bunch of big news developments.
[00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.040]  Now again, I can only commend...
[00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:55.658]  The rock band, one of the top bands now in England and steadily rising up the charts, Muse, for scrawling the name of Terror Storm on the front man's t-shirt and then being questioned by the BBC and others and telling them just go to Google and type in Terror Storm.
[00:08:56.258 --> 00:08:58.740]  And again, he tried to contact our office Friday.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.042]  We were unable to get in touch with him.
[00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:05.226]  We were headed to Dallas, but we will be getting in touch with those folks and trying to get them here on the broadcast.
[00:09:05.627 --> 00:09:07.648]  That is very, very exciting.
[00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:12.252]  Rock Frontman invites viewing millions to see Alex Jones' new movie, Terror Storm.
[00:09:12.693 --> 00:09:18.358]  Muse singer Scrawls' name of Terror Storm on t-shirt performs headlining show at Reading Festival.
[00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:19.681]  Yes, we are.
[00:09:37.737 --> 00:09:40.900]  regularly screened by the BBC to viewers in the UK.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:50.688]  Mews are considered one of the best alternative rock bands in Britain and have been playing many large stadiums in the United States in which their fan base is also large and ever-expanding.
[00:09:51.128 --> 00:09:54.891]  And I would just add to this article about how much courage they've got to do what they've done.
[00:09:55.211 --> 00:10:03.978]  We have to always herald and support and commend the courage of people that are prominent to go public because it is frankly dangerous.
[00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:05.960]  Following the performance
[00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:15.000]  Bellamy explained the meaning behind the t-shirt name and Britain's top-selling music magazine to NME.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.962]  He said, Go to Google Video, type in Terror Storm and you'll find a nice little surprise.
[00:10:21.282 --> 00:10:23.824]  It will shed some light on world affairs.
[00:10:24.004 --> 00:10:24.764]  Put it that way.
[00:10:24.844 --> 00:10:29.186]  I'd rather point you in the direction than preach about it myself, said Bellamy.
[00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:46.899]  BBC News report also picked up on the story with Terror Storm written on his t-shirt singer Matthew Bellamy took to a white piano at one point afterwards he said they were getting a vibe from the crowd and in the words of their own song they really seemed invincible.
[00:10:47.663 --> 00:11:00.642]  It is very exciting and a boom for 9-11 Truth Movement to have a major rock band encourage people to watch Terror Storm in front of 80,000 festival goers and millions watching at home on BBC television.
[00:11:00.823 --> 00:11:02.846]  The contention between the cultural...
[00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:18.086]  The connection between the cultural zeitgeist and the 9-11 truth movement, as well as the wider truth movement in general, is evergreen and can only help in spreading awareness amongst those who will inherit the battle to preserve all of our freedoms, the youth of today.
[00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:20.229]  It is our task
[00:11:21.027 --> 00:11:29.429]  to nurture the bond and ensure that it isn't a flash in the pan that gets replaced by the next fad in a couple of years time.
[00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:41.412]  Muse should be commended and more people in the public spotlight encouraged to use their soapbox to educate people on the reality of the hidden hand that directs world events from behind closed doors.
[00:11:42.512 --> 00:11:45.793]  And I would just again add to this that
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:12:01.831]  Now I'll repeat that it takes a lot of courage to do this, but it's this type of activity that may actually save this civilization and this society from the clutches of the ultra-wicked people that are in control of our society right now.
[00:12:03.252 --> 00:12:07.836]  Briefly before I plunge into all the news, we had a standing room only crowd.
[00:12:08.736 --> 00:12:10.838]  We said we were going to cut off ticket sales at
[00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:18.113]  At PrisonPlanet.com for the big Dallas premiere of TerrorStorm at 700 and it did sell out that afternoon.
[00:12:19.722 --> 00:12:25.606]  And they really had 776 seats placed, so I said, go ahead and sell 76 more tickets.
[00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:29.669]  We did sell out, and we didn't want to turn people away.
[00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:31.690]  We ended up letting in a dozen or so that showed up.
[00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:40.095]  So it was great that it just exactly sold out, but no one was turned away.
[00:12:40.115 --> 00:12:41.116]  It was really exciting.
[00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:42.337]  Jim Mars did a great job.
[00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:44.058]  Shanghai Five did a great job.
[00:12:44.378 --> 00:12:49.121]  So did Theater Fire, and of course the Arab League, the three great bands that came on afterwards.
[00:12:50.549 --> 00:13:00.756]  And it was just amazing to be there in the heart of Neocon system in Dallas, Texas, and to have a line wrapped around the block of people wanting to get in to hear the truth.
[00:13:00.836 --> 00:13:05.480]  It was wonderful to meet all of you and to see all of you, and I want to thank you all for coming out.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:14.806]  I'm about as tired as I've ever been, though, because I've been racing and doing a lot of interviews last week, getting ready for the event in Dallas.
[00:13:15.847 --> 00:13:16.808]  We got up to
[00:13:18.574 --> 00:13:45.972]  Dallas and went out to the grassy knoll basically all day long on Saturday before the event and a hundred and three degree temperatures I was interviewing Jim Mars for documentary in between that the BBC followed us around for hours we jumped through all the hoops they wanted us to as they interviewed us at nauseam about 9-11 and the connections to the JFK assassination and then we went and did the event and did interviews with Jim Mars and others while the films were playing
[00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:47.251]  I think?
[00:14:00.186 --> 00:14:04.050]  Love Field Terminal at about 645 in the morning.
[00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:22.586]  I'm watching CNN, or it was NBC actually, there in the terminal waiting and it's on the screen that in Kentucky, in Lexington, those guys went up the wrong ramp that wasn't long enough and basically, you know the rest, the plane crashed and exploded and 49 were killed.
[00:14:22.726 --> 00:14:26.209]  One survivor was in critical condition last time I checked it.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.164]  So there I was getting on the plane right after I hear that this is happening.
[00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:39.291]  I get back to Austin, see my children for about an hour, get suited up and go to a memorial service.
[00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:43.675]  My best friend who died a few months ago, he was cremated, so we were just having a memorial service.
[00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:50.762]  And after that, I got back in the car, drove into KLBJ Studios where the BBC was sneaking around.
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.981]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:15.476]  And then I discovered with horror that basically they'd been playing it cool the whole time.
[00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:21.944]  I had suspicions that it was some type of hit piece, though they kept giggling and snickering and saying that it wasn't a hit piece.
[00:15:21.964 --> 00:15:29.152]  We even had callers calling in from England saying, watch out, it's going to be a hit piece, while I was live on the radio, while they were in the studio.
[00:15:29.172 --> 00:15:30.594]  And then I went to dinner with them.
[00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:35.475]  And they'd say, you think Dr. David Kelly was killed?
[00:15:35.555 --> 00:15:36.896]  I'd say, well yeah, the evidence.
[00:15:37.377 --> 00:15:39.398]  His wrists were slit, there was no blood at the scene.
[00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:41.420]  He had unadjusted pills in his stomach.
[00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:45.043]  Witnesses said they saw men in black uniforms run away from the body.
[00:15:45.363 --> 00:15:48.386]  He told his friends that a shadowy group was moving against him.
[00:15:48.706 --> 00:15:50.948]  That if he didn't shut up, he'd be found dead in the woods.
[00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:53.210]  And that was in major news.
[00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.231]  They would just giggle and snicker.
[00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:56.913]  One of them was a top BBC presenter.
[00:15:57.726 --> 00:16:06.551]  And then one of them said, well, yeah, I actually did read that in the papers, one of the BBC crew, and they started laughing at him and saying, oh, now you're with him, now you're with him.
[00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:10.574]  And I was seeing double thinking Crime Stop, Crime Stops in 1984.
[00:16:10.634 --> 00:16:15.497]  By the way, George Orwell worked at the BBC as a propagandist.
[00:16:15.577 --> 00:16:18.658]  So, you know, he is Winston Smith in 1984.
[00:16:18.739 --> 00:16:22.841]  He's writing about himself, basically, and the book is an analogy of it.
[00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:27.932]  You know, 1984, 1948, that's when he wrote the book.
[00:16:28.012 --> 00:16:29.433]  It's just the numbers reversed.
[00:16:29.753 --> 00:16:31.814]  He's Winston Smith, the Ministry of Truth.
[00:16:33.435 --> 00:16:35.036]  And then I went on to Princess Diana.
[00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:38.718]  I said, she wrote a letter saying Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[00:16:38.738 --> 00:16:40.239]  And then all the evidence, they murdered her.
[00:16:40.939 --> 00:16:42.580]  And they were laughing at me about that.
[00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:51.145]  And then I would bring up, while they were interviewing me, because right at the end, that last hour and a half interview after the radio show was when they really came out with it.
[00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:55.883]  And I would say, well, what's your proof of 9-11 being an inside job?
[00:16:55.923 --> 00:16:57.044]  Well, Operation Northwood.
[00:16:57.084 --> 00:16:58.185]  Well, we don't want to talk about that.
[00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:01.326]  Well, what's your proof of bombs in the buildings?
[00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:08.931]  Well, Kevin Ryan of Underwriting Laboratories, you know, that did the internal tests of the buildings, they underwrote it, they did models, and you know, clearly the official stories of fraud.
[00:17:09.211 --> 00:17:12.833]  Well, don't say his name, and let's not really get into that.
[00:17:15.374 --> 00:17:18.096]  Let's talk about how this hurts the family's feelings.
[00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:21.936]  Well, the majority of the families are on record saying it's an inside job.
[00:17:21.976 --> 00:17:26.758]  Mr. Doyle, the head of the biggest group, 7,000 members, 7,000 families, believes it's an inside job.
[00:17:26.818 --> 00:17:28.178]  He said most of their members believe that.
[00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:34.180]  Folks, I know when it's a hit piece.
[00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:39.682]  There's maybe one chance in a hundred that it isn't.
[00:17:41.123 --> 00:17:44.644]  Again, in their double-speak world, they probably believe it isn't a hit piece.
[00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:49.699]  But they're interviewing Senator Graham for the piece they're doing.
[00:17:49.719 --> 00:17:52.922]  They've interviewed all these other individuals.
[00:17:53.022 --> 00:18:03.391]  And I really felt like my soul had been sucked out after the last few hours with these guys, because I could see their brains working.
[00:18:03.411 --> 00:18:04.292]  They weren't stupid.
[00:18:04.752 --> 00:18:07.154]  I could see them double-thinking and crime-stopping.
[00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:11.518]  Great terms Orwell came up with as a BBC producer.
[00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:13.461]  BBC Propagandist.
[00:18:14.182 --> 00:18:17.623]  I mean, I was literally talking to Ministry of Truth minions.
[00:18:19.323 --> 00:18:20.303]  It was just amazing.
[00:18:20.463 --> 00:18:25.285]  And then they got to my prediction of 9-11 and they said, well, doesn't that show that you're part of the conspiracy?
[00:18:25.865 --> 00:18:26.825]  And I said, what do you mean?
[00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:29.206]  I just learned of it and exposed it.
[00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:31.987]  That means I was trying to stop the conspiracy.
[00:18:32.507 --> 00:18:34.207]  Oh, no, that means you're part of it.
[00:18:34.748 --> 00:18:36.288]  And then smiling and snickering.
[00:18:37.037 --> 00:18:38.577]  I mean, this is not a laughing matter.
[00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:39.798]  This is, I mean, here I am.
[00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:41.338]  Folks, I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:18:41.658 --> 00:18:43.159]  Knowing every day could be my last.
[00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:47.740]  Here I am in horror of knowing we've got psychopathic criminals running the government.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.821]  Here we are working our hearts out, literally.
[00:18:50.841 --> 00:18:53.002]  I mean, I'm totally freaked out, folks.
[00:18:53.402 --> 00:18:55.583]  And I'm freaked out by how much success we're having.
[00:18:56.123 --> 00:18:57.103]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:18:57.123 --> 00:19:00.204]  I mean, I know that we're going where no one has gone before.
[00:19:00.524 --> 00:19:04.105]  We are engaging the New World Order deep in their own territory.
[00:19:04.145 --> 00:19:06.546]  We are hitting them and hitting them hard.
[00:19:07.469 --> 00:19:14.112]  I mean, John McCain is writing four words to Popular Mechanics, you know, and my name is mentioned as one of the arch enemies.
[00:19:14.993 --> 00:19:18.034]  You know, I mean, it's just that the enemy knows who I am.
[00:19:18.094 --> 00:19:19.935]  The enemy knows I'm hurting them.
[00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:22.857]  And I just, I cannot stop.
[00:19:22.877 --> 00:19:24.998]  I am compelled to do what I'm doing.
[00:19:25.018 --> 00:19:26.098]  I am never going to stop.
[00:19:26.158 --> 00:19:27.159]  I'm never going to surrender.
[00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:28.659]  I'm never going to back down.
[00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:33.642]  And I just, I just, you know, hope that if anything ever does happen to me,
[00:19:34.736 --> 00:19:36.277]  And again, I'm never going to commit suicide.
[00:19:36.317 --> 00:19:36.857]  I love life.
[00:19:36.897 --> 00:19:38.038]  Anything ever does happen to me.
[00:19:39.138 --> 00:19:50.724]  I just hope that when the feds are hitting me and they're trying to discredit me on the web, I just hope that you will help at least not let them destroy me after the fact when I'm not here to defend myself.
[00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:53.105]  God's on our side.
[00:19:53.145 --> 00:19:53.606]  I know that.
[00:19:53.686 --> 00:19:55.527]  We've got guardian angels here with us right now.
[00:19:56.067 --> 00:20:00.349]  I just, right now, we are hurting them badly and it's only expanding.
[00:20:03.314 --> 00:20:04.355]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:07.457]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.738 --> 00:20:11.881]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:13.142]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:18.026]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:20.654]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:21.134 --> 00:20:22.034]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:20:22.434 --> 00:20:35.838]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:07.632]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:15.860]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:16.201 --> 00:21:24.049]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:24.369 --> 00:21:29.131]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.451 --> 00:21:34.172]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.672 --> 00:21:38.534]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:39.034 --> 00:21:40.034]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:22:03.413 --> 00:22:06.197]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:06.417 --> 00:22:12.284]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:22.275]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:33.791]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.408 --> 00:23:07.993]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[00:23:08.093 --> 00:23:11.076]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[00:23:11.276 --> 00:23:15.079]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing these rights.
[00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:17.121]  Today, you can take this stand.

[00:23:22.265 --> 00:23:27.629]  Each shirt is black, with a redesign of the famous Don't Tread on Me Gadsden flag located on the front of the shirt.
[00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:30.912]  On the back is the Bill of Rights, printed in bold white text.
[00:23:31.272 --> 00:23:31.953]  We're good to go.
[00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:17.301]  Alright, Paul Watson will be with us for the next two segments.
[00:24:18.142 --> 00:24:20.103]  We've got Les Jamieson, New York 9-11 Truth.
[00:24:21.624 --> 00:24:22.185]  Big update.
[00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:24.106]  A lot of other news we're going to be covering.
[00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:28.830]  And Patrick Buchanan, who I've filmed the show three or four times in the past.
[00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.551]  I haven't had him on in about three years.
[00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:37.264]  He normally shows up, one time he showed up the day after he was supposed to come on, but he's scheduled a third hour.
[00:24:37.304 --> 00:24:38.605]  If not, he'll be on sometime this week.
[00:24:38.645 --> 00:24:40.127]  I'm just not completely counting on it.
[00:24:40.147 --> 00:24:46.374]  He's going to be at Fox Studios doing some live interview right before, and then he's coming on at 1 o'clock.
[00:24:46.454 --> 00:24:50.098]  Scheduled for a full hour, but we'll see what happens there.
[00:24:50.818 --> 00:24:52.399]  I'm glad you're here so I can lean on you.
[00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:53.579]  I'm like a boxer on the ropes today.
[00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:56.201]  Just totally exhausted, but again, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:24:56.221 --> 00:24:57.801]  Good to be back Alex, especially after the
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.861]  The supposed apocalypse happened on August 22nd.
[00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:24.982]  It's good to hear that you're still on the air.
[00:25:25.302 --> 00:25:31.044]  Yeah, let's talk about the apocalypse that didn't happen and that the government said would happen and the media did.
[00:25:31.344 --> 00:25:36.446]  Then let's talk about this Washington Post disinfo piece on Bin Laden.
[00:25:36.946 --> 00:25:42.668]  And then let's get into the big rock band that's really doing a great job exposing 9-11.
[00:25:43.289 --> 00:25:44.049]  Just launch into it.
[00:25:45.382 --> 00:25:46.543]  Well, yeah.
[00:25:46.763 --> 00:26:01.472]  The comments about the so-called August 22nd apocalypse are notable by their absence after the event supposedly happened from the Glenn Beck, the Fox News, the Drudge Reports, the Newsmax, the Frontpage magazine.
[00:26:01.933 --> 00:26:04.154]  The Wall Street Journal is who started it.
[00:26:04.755 --> 00:26:12.940]  The Wall Street Journal op-ed by Middle East professor Bernard Lewis who said that Iran would seek to bring about that it was
[00:26:14.266 --> 00:26:27.391]  Possible, I mean they hyped it to a great degree before the event ever happened, that Iran would seek to bring about the apocalypse by starting World War 3 by nuking major western cities and cities in Israel.
[00:26:28.651 --> 00:26:38.975]  Of course, it was total militaristic crackpot warmongering, nothing ever happened, but they're never called to carpet, never called to task after the event itself.
[00:26:40.315 --> 00:26:55.582]  Joel Rosenberg, who you debated ten days, two weeks ago, was hyping the same thing, that this would be the day in which Armageddon will launch his non-existent nuclear arsenal.
[00:26:57.742 --> 00:27:18.334]  And it all started with a Wall Street Journal piece where he stated they would probably do it, they were gonna do it, but then you actually read deeper, they say that Ahmadinejad had not said anything like this, this was the media's own weird interpretation, it was just made up, but I mean, how do they have any credibility after all the other hoaxes they've perpetrated?
[00:27:19.735 --> 00:27:22.496]  Well, they simply don't mention it after it doesn't happen.
[00:27:24.137 --> 00:27:26.859]  Speaking about misinterpreted statements,
[00:27:27.822 --> 00:27:34.804]  I mean, the, we want to wipe Israel off the map was totally taken out of context in the first place.
[00:27:34.824 --> 00:27:49.048]  He said he wanted to end the political system of Zionism, which is like when, you know, we say we want to end the New World Order, it doesn't mean we want to launch nuclear weapons on anyone, it just means we want to end a certain political system.
[00:27:50.368 --> 00:27:52.289]  Ahmadinejad came out yesterday and said,
[00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:57.904]  Iran is no threat to Israel or anyone else, but nobody's going to pick up on that.
[00:27:57.924 --> 00:27:58.324]  That's right.
[00:27:58.364 --> 00:28:02.625]  He said, in fact, I have the quotes, he says, we're not going to attack them if they don't attack us.
[00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:05.746]  We're going to leave Israel alone and the U.S.
[00:28:06.066 --> 00:28:07.626]  He said, we want to be friends.
[00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:15.069]  Yeah, and all of these quotes come after the proviso of if you attack us, then we'll respond like that.
[00:28:15.869 --> 00:28:22.411]  If Chinese troops invaded L.A., then do you just expect American citizens to lie down and be enslaved?
[00:28:23.064 --> 00:28:49.661]  Obviously they're going to respond if they're attacked but I mean even Drudge Report hyped it before the event and then on August 22nd itself Drudge put this big red headline in capital letters at the top of his website Iran Responds and it kind of semi alluded to the fact that something had happened on August 22nd basically it was just a story about the diplomatic process in the UN but it was in big red letters and then to the side
[00:28:50.191 --> 00:28:56.393]  He also had in big red letters a story about the Russian plane crash, which was immediately ruled out to be an accident.
[00:28:57.013 --> 00:29:10.597]  But the fact that they were both in red, and all these other stories about Iran were in red, he was implicitly trying to link the Russian plane crash to the fact that something big was going to happen on August 22nd, which of course it never did.
[00:29:10.637 --> 00:29:12.698]  There wasn't even a terrorist attack, there was nothing.
[00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:16.959]  So they desperately tried to claw something out of the ashes of their
[00:29:17.668 --> 00:29:18.068]  Yeah.
[00:29:18.148 --> 00:29:23.492]  But Kim Jong-il routinely says he wants to destroy the Earth, but nobody seems concerned about that.
[00:29:23.532 --> 00:29:29.456]  He's got nukes, Iran's at least nine years away from them, but that doesn't seem to matter.
[00:29:40.473 --> 00:29:43.734]  And Israel's openly talking about striking Iran because the U.S.
[00:29:43.774 --> 00:29:44.694]  hasn't done it yet.
[00:29:45.194 --> 00:29:47.435]  We're still hurtling towards World War III.
[00:29:47.475 --> 00:29:48.235]  Stay with us, Paul.

[00:30:02.418 --> 00:30:05.701]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[00:30:06.201 --> 00:30:08.363]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem?
[00:30:08.883 --> 00:30:14.248]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[00:31:01.903 --> 00:31:07.129]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:15.358]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.619 --> 00:31:22.667]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.

[00:32:01.877 --> 00:32:06.518]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:32:06.578 --> 00:32:07.298]  have diabetes.
[00:32:07.638 --> 00:32:14.579]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:32:14.719 --> 00:32:19.240]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.281]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:33:06.428 --> 00:33:08.348]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.829 --> 00:33:11.629]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.649 --> 00:33:31.433]  One of the hottest rock bands in England, Muse, their lead singer, wore a shirt with Terror Storm on it, and then just told the press to go to Google Video and type Terror Storm in, and that it would be quite informative for them.
[00:33:32.188 --> 00:33:33.288]  Just a correction.
[00:33:33.429 --> 00:33:34.749]  Again, we were leaving Friday.
[00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:35.629]  I was already gone.
[00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:41.872]  And Kevin, when I walked in this morning, I said, did you hear about that big UK rock band on BBC TV talking about Terror Storm?
[00:33:42.672 --> 00:33:44.393]  And he said, yeah.
[00:33:44.453 --> 00:33:49.615]  We got a call from a UK rock band, but he hadn't pulled out the notes yet.
[00:33:49.715 --> 00:33:56.497]  And that was another UK rock band that was going to be playing that wanted to talk to us about how to plug.
[00:34:00.776 --> 00:34:14.591]  I want to get into your great article about the story in the Washington Post trying to spin things because it's really hurting the official 9-11 fable, the official hoax that they've taken Bin Laden off the 10 most wanted.
[00:34:14.612 --> 00:34:15.593]  They haven't indicted him.
[00:34:16.213 --> 00:34:17.074]  All of this is happening.
[00:34:17.094 --> 00:34:18.035]  People are pointing it out.
[00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:23.539]  But before we get to that, since I've mentioned news, for those that aren't in the UK, of course, they're quite big here.
[00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.341]  Two of the folks here in my office listen to them.
[00:34:25.361 --> 00:34:26.482]  I didn't know that.
[00:34:26.502 --> 00:34:28.904]  I haven't had a chance to hear their music yet, but I'm told it's great stuff.
[00:34:30.665 --> 00:34:31.606]  This is a big deal.
[00:34:31.626 --> 00:34:34.628]  They're huge in the UK and rising.
[00:34:35.029 --> 00:34:35.649]  Tell us all about it.
[00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:41.277]  Well yeah, it occurred at the Reading Music Festival.
[00:34:41.317 --> 00:34:46.501]  There's two music festivals which take place over the bank holiday weekend in the UK.
[00:34:47.882 --> 00:34:49.243]  One's Reading and one's Leeds.
[00:34:49.683 --> 00:35:01.231]  The Reading one has a capacity of 80,000, so as they were the headlining act, Muse, they had anything up to 80,000 people watching that headlining gig.
[00:35:02.037 --> 00:35:07.980]  And the coverage of the set was also carried on BBC One and BBC Two.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:18.665]  And obviously then they gave the interview afterwards to NME, New Musical Express, which is the biggest music publication in Britain, and it's famous worldwide.
[00:35:20.026 --> 00:35:26.809]  BBC also reported on it, the fact that the lead singer, Matt Bellamy, was wearing this Terror Storm T-shirt.
[00:35:26.849 --> 00:35:30.571]  They didn't say what Terror Storm was, but they reported on it.
[00:35:31.677 --> 00:35:34.219]  Um, so it got a lot of attention, as you said.
[00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:40.943]  I mean, I began getting emails about it yesterday afternoon, and then came across the NME article which confirmed it.
[00:35:41.323 --> 00:35:50.909]  Um, and obviously the lead singer told the NME after the gig, um, quote, go to Google Video, type in TerrorStorm, and you'll find a nice little surprise.
[00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:52.770]  It will shed some light on world affairs.
[00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.530]  Put it that way.
[00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:57.513]  I'd rather point you in the direction than preach about it myself.
[00:35:58.033 --> 00:35:59.334]  That's what the lead singer said.
[00:36:00.598 --> 00:36:12.763]  So, it's just another example of, you know, the kind of cultural zeitgeist at the moment's working in our favour, because the 9-11 Truth Movement has become cool, as it were.
[00:36:12.843 --> 00:36:23.728]  Obviously, we were here a long time before that happened, and you even further, Alex, but now almost every major alternative music act, and even several mainstream ones,
[00:36:24.787 --> 00:36:30.831]  The most popular songs that they've had in the past two or three years always reference the kind of subjects that we talk about.
[00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:39.537]  You can barely tune into a kind of rock radio station now without avoiding, you know, these kind of lyrics about the subjects that we cover.
[00:36:40.237 --> 00:36:44.360]  The One World Government, who knocked down the towers, the government carried out 9-11.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.562]  That's why John McCain and others are starting to panic.
[00:36:48.488 --> 00:36:50.449]  And writing hit pieces against us.
[00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:56.751]  And I gotta tell you though, Paul, it's gotta be exciting for the general public to know we're getting closer and closer to bringing these people down.
[00:36:56.791 --> 00:37:00.853]  But to be on the front lines, and you're definitely there with me, my friend.
[00:37:00.893 --> 00:37:02.793]  I mean, we are going where no one's gone before.
[00:37:03.153 --> 00:37:04.314]  We are actually hurting them.
[00:37:04.694 --> 00:37:06.134]  We are actually taking the momentum.
[00:37:06.174 --> 00:37:07.455]  We are actually seizing the moment.
[00:37:07.755 --> 00:37:09.135]  We are actually leveraging them.
[00:37:09.776 --> 00:37:12.417]  They can see that we're exploding right now, the information.
[00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:15.238]  It is, to know the enemy is looking right at us.
[00:37:16.378 --> 00:37:18.979]  It's exhilarating but also horrifying.
[00:37:20.099 --> 00:37:32.142]  Right and obviously it's a long process but I mean from just from their reaction you can tell that we're way ahead of where they expected us to be and they expected their agenda to have advanced further than it has.
[00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:37.383]  But I mean with the music and with Charlie Sheen and people like that coming forward
[00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:46.656]  It just provides a more palatable vehicle on which we can showcase the truth because, you know, we live in an instant gratification society.
[00:37:47.337 --> 00:37:56.063]  We need all the tools in our arsenal to educate people and music, songs and music videos and this kind of stuff is evergreen.
[00:37:56.103 --> 00:38:05.790]  I mean, 12 years ago I was listening to stuff like Rage Against the Machine which, obviously Rage Against the Machine don't provide the right solutions, they're basically communist, but
[00:38:06.548 --> 00:38:17.992]  It allows young people to become educated about issues which they wouldn't normally run across in the pabulum that's served up to them on MTV.
[00:38:19.093 --> 00:38:32.698]  The rap movement, for example, started out in America with Public Enemy and people like that as encouraging black people to get out of the drugs and get out of the ghettos and things like that and to become empowered and educated.
[00:38:33.106 --> 00:38:40.089]  Then MTV swooped in and took over it and it all became about, you know, drugs and women and bling and all this kind of stuff.
[00:38:40.129 --> 00:38:50.333]  They hijacked it, but there's still a vibrant undercurrent from what I see in alternative rap and things like that, which are purely about things like 9-11.
[00:38:50.793 --> 00:38:53.214]  And that's all over the internet that people can check out.
[00:38:53.234 --> 00:38:57.476]  But obviously, you know, this kind of thing can split two ways where you'll get some
[00:38:58.407 --> 00:38:58.587]  I think?
[00:39:17.192 --> 00:39:27.020]  And others like them, it shows an evergreen potential for the 9-11 Truth Movement to become even higher in profile and educate more people, especially young people.
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:34.766]  Paul, will you add in there a quote from my shelf, the article near the top, because when Muse reads it, I want them to know
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:47.633]  That we really appreciate their courage, we recognize their courage, we recognize their sacrifice in doing this, and that it's a great example of
[00:39:50.067 --> 00:40:03.276]  People taking strong moral stands and that they're going to be a wonderful testament to everybody else out there because obviously they're extremely popular in the UK and here in the United States.
[00:40:03.336 --> 00:40:11.002]  So stepping across that line, joining us, doing that is just one of the more beautiful things that we see in this fight.
[00:40:11.682 --> 00:40:18.727]  And it just always feels good to see more and more people who are already on our side, already aware of what's happening, now taking the plunge
[00:40:19.692 --> 00:40:22.374]  You know, into the fray, onto the battlefield with us.
[00:40:24.275 --> 00:40:29.198]  Right, and I mean, people use the different skills they have to contribute what they can.
[00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:41.066]  I mean, I can't host a radio show, anything like Alex Jones can, but, you know, I can contribute other skills to the information war, and that's what I do.
[00:40:41.146 --> 00:40:46.049]  So, I mean, artists, you know, graphic designers, cartoonists, people like that,
[00:40:46.656 --> 00:40:52.561]  They've all got their own medium in which they can contribute to what we're doing and what everyone else is doing.
[00:40:52.581 --> 00:41:08.693]  The more high-profile people that come out, the better, because obviously then it becomes less of a wacko conspiracy theory as they try to spin it, and more of the sentiment of the cultural zeitgeist, which is normally what changes the world.
[00:41:08.773 --> 00:41:14.658]  Well, reading John McCain's forward, you're right, reading John McCain's forward to the Popper Mechanics disinfo piece,
[00:41:15.282 --> 00:41:20.924]  And reading other things they're saying now, they are really seeming to be afraid.
[00:41:21.424 --> 00:41:37.531]  Now, when I see them on television, or I hear them on the radio, they are now really starting to act like they're starting to realize that we're not playing games here, and that we know what the government did, criminal elements of it did, and that we're not going to stop.
[00:41:37.611 --> 00:41:41.932]  I think they're starting to realize that the people don't trust them anymore.
[00:41:42.392 --> 00:41:43.793]  All the lies they've been caught in,
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.124]  The WMD lies that...
[00:41:46.914 --> 00:42:15.189]  What happened at the Watergate building, the black men in syphilis in Tuskegee, and all the news coming out about the mercury in the vaccines, and just the thousands and thousands of lies, the White House memo, the Wall Street connection to Hitler, you know, stuff going back 60 years, it's all coming out, and the people are learning of this, and so when the BBC, I told the BBC, I said, go ahead and do your hit piece, and if people don't trust you anymore, they don't listen to you anymore,
[00:42:15.669 --> 00:42:22.973]  And so just go ahead and tell them how bad we are, and go ahead and tell the people, you know, how we're a bunch of liars, because they're going to find out that you're spinning things.
[00:42:23.354 --> 00:42:24.674]  It isn't working for them.
[00:42:24.714 --> 00:42:27.076]  I think they're beginning to understand.
[00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:44.726]  Just now, the first realization is dawning in the back of their dark little minds that we've got the initiative, and that we've got the moral focus, and that we've got the moral initiative here, and that they're going to lose.
[00:42:46.784 --> 00:43:01.251]  Right, and they're so myopic that they're still stuck in the rut of using the same demonization tactics that they've been using for decades by saying anyone who criticizes the government's version on anything is crazy.
[00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:13.176]  When even what's leaked out already, in the case of 9-11 with the EPA cover-up and the fact that they knew that those Ground Zero rescue personnel
[00:43:14.033 --> 00:43:17.716]  were breathing in toxic air which would cause terminal illness.
[00:43:17.916 --> 00:43:28.825]  And they just chose to not give them treatment and to cut them off when it was only going to be 96 million to take care of the firefighters and the police and they just sold them out.
[00:43:28.885 --> 00:43:29.506]  See police?
[00:43:29.806 --> 00:43:30.647]  See firefighters?
[00:43:31.187 --> 00:43:33.469]  I mean, they don't think anything of you.
[00:43:33.509 --> 00:43:41.396]  In fact, new mainstream news is coming out on that and we knew that the EPA had, and she resigned by the way quietly over it, Christina Todd Whitman,
[00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:51.745]  We know that they picked up the particulates, they picked up the asbestos, they picked up the mercury from the tens of thousands of thermostats.
[00:43:52.623 --> 00:44:13.895]  that were in the building and all that was aerosolized and their detectors picked it up and then Bush said, and this was in the news by the way, that's it, you're not going to report on it, we're withdrawing this report and then they issued another report saying the air was normal and clean and then now we've got a new EPA whistleblower going public.
[00:44:13.915 --> 00:44:14.435]  Tell us about it.
[00:44:16.116 --> 00:44:19.778]  Well yeah, they have the goal to accuse us of
[00:44:21.966 --> 00:44:35.976]  Disgracing the memory of the heroes and the victims of 9-11 when, you know, even Bill Doyle, the top guy who represents hundreds of the families, says that half of them believe what we believe now and more are believing it every day.
[00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:49.106]  But they have the gall to say that we're disgracing the memories of the heroes and the victims when they're the ones who failed to protect them deliberately in the first place, resulting in terminal illnesses and the very people that were
[00:44:49.898 --> 00:44:51.280]  I agree.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:45:01.890]  You should do a little article on that about how the media always tries to say we're disgracing the memories.
[00:45:03.092 --> 00:45:10.980]  The Bush-Basher piece they wrote for World Night Daily that they had to retract, by the way, because it was so full of distortions and disinfo.
[00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:15.771]  We need to write an article about that explaining that we are defending the memory.
[00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:18.292]  We're trying to make sure the truth comes out.
[00:45:18.352 --> 00:45:21.314]  We know we've been lied to and just list the admitted lies.
[00:45:21.334 --> 00:45:23.675]  The government said they never heard of planes to fly planes into buildings.
[00:45:24.235 --> 00:45:25.596]  Then they said they weren't running drills.
[00:45:25.616 --> 00:45:27.256]  They've had to admit both of those are lies.
[00:45:27.577 --> 00:45:29.798]  Then they said that FBI agents didn't have warnings.
[00:45:30.078 --> 00:45:34.260]  Turns out those were lies and Bush signed W1999 ordering them to back off.
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.821]  The quote hijackers were really government decoys.
[00:45:37.161 --> 00:45:42.084]  The FBI was picking up those signals from their ledger, their history they were creating.
[00:45:42.862 --> 00:45:49.831]  You can do a piece on that explaining how the victims' families, groups, you can go list the Jersey girls, all of them.
[00:45:50.873 --> 00:45:53.336]  Saying that it's a cover-up, it's an inside job.
[00:45:53.856 --> 00:46:01.642]  I mean, I started yelling at the BBC yesterday because they kept literally snickering and yelling, that you're hurting their memory, they're angry at you.
[00:46:02.023 --> 00:46:03.024]  No, they're not!
[00:46:03.364 --> 00:46:08.448]  And they can go find some of them, I'm sure that are, but the majority are really waking up now.
[00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:13.653]  And regardless, I know the truth, you know the truth, Paul, and we've got a responsibility to do this.
[00:46:18.334 --> 00:46:39.272]  Whereas people like Fox News will exhibit the kind of reactionary hate-filled gusto against people questioning 9-11, the BBC will maintain this sort of lefty establishment, snickering, sneering viewpoint, which is also prevalent in big Guardian articles, which is a big left-wing newspaper in the UK.
[00:46:39.692 --> 00:46:46.538]  Then you'll read the comments below the articles and they're all attacking the journalist as not knowing the facts and just going off rhetoric.
[00:46:47.526 --> 00:46:56.554]  But the nub of it comes down to the fact that all we're trying to do is prevent the next big terror attack in the US, because it's going to lead us into World War 3.
[00:46:58.075 --> 00:47:08.263]  Not just from your prediction that it would happen, but Dick Cheney's own STRATCOM contingency plan, which was reported in American Conservative Magazine, which said the next 9-11 in the US
[00:47:09.437 --> 00:47:19.444]  Will automatically be blamed on Iran and Iran 450 major sites in Iran will automatically be targeted for an airstrike which includes tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:47:20.064 --> 00:47:21.125]  That's the black and white.
[00:47:21.485 --> 00:47:22.786]  Paul, let me paraphrase this.
[00:47:22.886 --> 00:47:24.087]  I covered it yesterday on the radio.
[00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:25.027]  I don't have it in front of me.
[00:47:25.488 --> 00:47:31.432]  We have the exact quotes of William Cohen last week, a Republican who worked for Clinton as Secretary of Defense.
[00:47:32.052 --> 00:47:36.615]  And Cohen gets up there with double speak and says, I don't know if we're going to need a draft.
[00:47:37.506 --> 00:47:42.370]  But we certainly need national service so everyone can sacrifice in the war on terror.
[00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.052]  Now that's almost an exact quote.
[00:47:44.072 --> 00:47:46.574]  If you've got a computer, why don't you pull that up and read the exact quote.
[00:47:46.594 --> 00:47:48.356]  Because I want to be precise about this.
[00:47:49.417 --> 00:47:51.318]  But they've got the bills introduced.
[00:47:51.358 --> 00:47:52.880]  They've set up the draft boards again.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:48:08.472]  They've got two different bills, a Republican and Democratic bill for the last three years, the last several Congresses, and every time we talk about this and say, we don't want a draft, they then come back with doublespeak and say, there's no draft, there's no plans for a draft, you're crazy!
[00:48:08.672 --> 00:48:16.077]  When they've introduced the bills, and they're all over TV saying, we don't need a draft, we need national service, that's doublespeak!
[00:48:16.338 --> 00:48:19.600]  National service, compulsory service, is a draft!
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.662]  I mean, just the level of this!
[00:48:23.638 --> 00:48:25.739]  Well yeah, he called it Universal Service.
[00:48:26.099 --> 00:48:31.720]  And to be on a war footing, which basically means Homeland Security Service, it's Tattletail Squad.
[00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:36.102]  It's things like that, which are aimed at, quote, Fisk columnists.
[00:48:36.562 --> 00:48:37.762]  You remember Gonzales?
[00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:41.803]  I mean, that's even worse than a classic military conscription or British press gang.
[00:48:42.144 --> 00:48:49.586]  We're talking about, and they reported, about 40% of it will be domestic tattletail squads, warrant service, checkpoints.
[00:48:49.606 --> 00:48:50.306]  This is official.
[00:48:50.726 --> 00:48:53.387]  And they've got the legislation, a National Service Act,
[00:48:54.002 --> 00:48:55.603]  Right, and you know where it'll all go.
[00:49:16.013 --> 00:49:25.897]  It'll go towards the manning of the halibut and constructed concentration force gulag labour camps, which were calmly reported in the New York Times.
[00:49:25.917 --> 00:49:45.266]  And as it was in World War II, first it'll be the Muslims that go in them, and they'll have been a massive attack in the US, so not many people pay attention to that, because they'll be careful, publicly at least, to just round up the Muslims, whereas privately they'll be rounding up political subversives, and then it'll go
[00:49:45.954 --> 00:49:52.338]  It'll go widespread if they get their wish, and if we go into World War 3, that's exactly what will precede it.
[00:49:52.998 --> 00:49:53.979]  I want to be clear here.
[00:49:54.019 --> 00:49:56.940]  The globalists openly said they want to start World War 3.
[00:49:58.041 --> 00:50:00.302]  They openly are going to draft your sons and daughters.
[00:50:01.343 --> 00:50:06.586]  They openly, while this war is going on, if you think 3.5 trillion missing from the Pentagon,
[00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:08.544]  is bad.
[00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:12.328]  Every day I read about some new pension fund being taken.
[00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:15.391]  It's all going to be a hundred times worse.
[00:50:15.411 --> 00:50:17.613]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:50:17.893 --> 00:50:19.535]  This is why we're trying to stop this.
[00:50:20.096 --> 00:50:21.978]  This is why you've got to expose government terror.
[00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:24.500]  Because these people aren't going to stop.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.361]  Do you understand?
[00:50:25.661 --> 00:50:26.722]  We have to stop them.
[00:50:27.163 --> 00:50:30.346]  If you're going to be free, at any level, you're going to have to fight.
[00:50:33.436 --> 00:50:35.477]  Paul, do one more segment with us, because we run over here.
[00:50:35.497 --> 00:50:38.658]  I want to get into this Washington Post spin piece about Bin Laden.
[00:50:39.999 --> 00:50:40.719]  It's incredible.
[00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:42.159]  Stay with us.
[00:50:42.299 --> 00:50:44.200]  Five more minutes with Paul, then we've got a guest coming up.
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.921]  We'll open the phones up in the second hour.
[00:50:48.422 --> 00:50:50.482]  They're getting rid of our borders and our sovereignty.
[00:50:50.522 --> 00:50:53.564]  The American Union is openly being shut up right now.
[00:50:54.364 --> 00:50:55.804]  The government's looting everything.
[00:50:55.844 --> 00:50:57.085]  They're grabbing private property.
[00:50:57.985 --> 00:50:59.706]  I mean, we've got to stop them!
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.060]  It's here!
[00:51:05.261 --> 00:51:10.004]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.404 --> 00:51:18.070]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:25.795]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.215 --> 00:51:33.040]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:37.653]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.934 --> 00:51:41.436]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.897 --> 00:51:43.818]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.159 --> 00:51:48.062]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:10.077 --> 00:54:12.958]  Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity.
[00:54:12.998 --> 00:54:14.699]  Let it roll for a moment.
[00:54:15.019 --> 00:54:22.063]  All our times have come.
[00:54:22.123 --> 00:54:25.324]  Here but now they're gone.
[00:54:28.425 --> 00:54:30.186]  Seasons don't feel the rebirth.
[00:54:30.366 --> 00:54:32.467]  Nor do the wind, the sun, or the rain.
[00:54:32.507 --> 00:54:35.569]  We can be like they are.
[00:54:36.149 --> 00:54:38.190]  Come on, baby, don't fail.
[00:54:38.933 --> 00:54:43.697]  Baby take my hand, join me We'll be able to fly
[00:55:27.444 --> 00:55:32.595]  I don't think so.
[00:55:42.935 --> 00:55:52.965]  It's like Johnny Cash says, you got one life to live, you should do what you should.
[00:55:53.045 --> 00:55:55.348]  You should do the right thing.
[00:56:05.899 --> 00:56:09.541]  It isn't the man who dies who has the most toys that wins.
[00:56:09.561 --> 00:56:13.824]  It's the person that builds, the person that loves, the person that stands up for what's right.
[00:56:14.244 --> 00:56:15.005]  That's what matters.
[00:56:15.025 --> 00:56:15.925]  That's what life is all about.
[00:56:15.945 --> 00:56:19.507]  In the few minutes we've got left, Paul, you've done a great job.
[00:56:19.547 --> 00:56:21.549]  Everybody should go get this article and spread it far and wide.
[00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:25.231]  The media is really having problems right now because it's coming out.
[00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:26.452]  They never looked for Bin Laden.
[00:56:26.472 --> 00:56:27.352]  They never wanted him.
[00:56:27.652 --> 00:56:28.713]  They never went after him.
[00:56:28.813 --> 00:56:30.114]  Buzzy Kromgaard, all of it.
[00:56:30.874 --> 00:56:32.716]  And he's not on the FBI wanted list.
[00:56:32.736 --> 00:56:33.756]  They haven't indicted him.
[00:56:33.816 --> 00:56:34.837]  They haven't done any of this.
[00:56:36.052 --> 00:56:38.873]  Because, as the FBI said, they can't prove that he did it.
[00:56:39.654 --> 00:56:42.415]  They have a fake Fatman Laden tape that's it.
[00:56:42.455 --> 00:56:43.975]  Tell us about this latest spin piece.
[00:56:45.316 --> 00:56:55.400]  Well, yeah, the nub of the issue is that Bin Laden's FBI wanted page on the FBI website does not reference specifically 9-11 in any way.
[00:56:56.861 --> 00:57:04.544]  Bin Laden was criminally indicted of involvement in the August 7, 1998 bombings of the United States embassies in Kenya.
[00:57:05.453 --> 00:57:06.714]  Um, and Tanzania.
[00:57:07.675 --> 00:57:13.519]  And he was indicted on November 4th, 1998, less than three months after the event.
[00:57:14.159 --> 00:57:17.002]  It's nearly five years after September 11th.
[00:57:17.782 --> 00:57:20.684]  Um, and there's been no criminal indictment of Bin Laden.
[00:57:21.084 --> 00:57:27.109]  Because as FBI, uh, public relations, uh, official Rex Toombs said,
[00:57:27.825 --> 00:57:36.848]  Quote, the reason why 9-11 is not mentioned on Osama Bin Laden's Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9-11.
[00:57:37.809 --> 00:57:40.130]  And he also told Wired News in 2001.
[00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:48.953]  Quote, to be charged with a crime this means we have found evidence to confirm our suspicions and a prosecutor has said we will pursue this case in court.
[00:57:49.533 --> 00:57:54.055]  That was nearly five years ago and still no evidence as to Bin Laden's involvement in 9-11
[00:57:55.329 --> 00:57:58.412]  Tell folks how the Washington Post is spinning this.
[00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:16.092]  So immediately the Washington Post with an article today by one of their chief investigators, Dan Eggen.
[00:58:16.112 --> 00:58:17.573]  You're going to have to do five more minutes.
[00:58:17.713 --> 00:58:18.573]  One minute break, folks.
[00:58:18.613 --> 00:58:19.994]  Seventy seconds was the I.D.
[00:58:20.054 --> 00:58:20.574]  We'll come back.
[00:58:20.814 --> 00:58:24.596]  Five more with Paul, and then we're going to go to Les Jamieson on 9-11 and take your calls.
[00:58:24.636 --> 00:58:25.696]  Paul, hang in there.
[00:58:26.657 --> 00:58:29.038]  I couldn't not play part of that song.
[00:58:29.558 --> 00:58:34.140]  All right, we'll be right back as we start the second hour on this Monday, the 28th of August, 2006.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:38.822]  Go to Infowars.com and get your Terror Storm copies today.
[00:58:41.573 --> 00:58:46.577]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.597 --> 00:58:47.317]  More than... Big Brother.
[00:58:47.337 --> 00:58:48.198]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.238 --> 00:58:50.579]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.482]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.657 --> 00:59:05.558]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.578 --> 00:59:10.001]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:14.504]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.485 --> 00:59:18.426]  Well, he joins us every few weeks on average.
[00:59:18.466 --> 00:59:19.447]  He's Paul Watson.
[00:59:19.487 --> 00:59:26.092]  He heads up two of my big news websites, PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:27.072 --> 00:59:28.733]  And we ran out of time in the last hour.
[00:59:28.793 --> 00:59:30.955]  Les Jamieson with New York 9-11 Truth coming up.
[00:59:31.602 --> 00:59:34.783]  In the rest of the hour, we'll open the phones up and talk about any issues you wish to discuss.
[00:59:34.803 --> 00:59:36.583]  But right now, Paul is finishing up.
[00:59:36.623 --> 00:59:39.084]  There's a big Washington Post article that came out over the weekend.
[00:59:39.424 --> 00:59:40.604]  Paul's written a response to it.
[00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:44.125]  The people picked up on the fact that Bin Laden was never indicted.
[00:59:44.205 --> 00:59:46.826]  The FBI said they don't have any evidence that he carried out the attacks.
[00:59:47.326 --> 00:59:50.386]  The fake, fat Bin Laden video has been voice-print analysis.
[00:59:50.466 --> 00:59:51.287]  It's not Bin Laden.
[00:59:51.987 --> 00:59:52.667]  That's another hoax.
[00:59:53.587 --> 00:59:55.989]  And so the Washington Post is trying to spin this.
[00:59:56.409 --> 00:59:57.650]  Paul comes back and counters.
[00:59:57.670 --> 01:00:04.915]  There hasn't even been an indictment, much less, you know, Bin Laden being taken off the FBI 10 Most Wanted list.
[01:00:05.276 --> 01:00:10.279]  Paul, in the last few minutes we've got left in this segment, break down how the Washington Post is trying to spin this.
[01:00:10.299 --> 01:00:15.863]  Yeah, basically the angle of the spin is no big deal.
[01:00:16.283 --> 01:00:22.528]  They try and play down the significance of it, even though the truth is hidden in plain view like it normally is.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:39.305]  Because the Post admits there's no verified criminal evidence to implicate Bin Laden in 9-11, but it still tries to make the case that it's unsurprising that the FBI wanted page on their website contains no reference to 9-11 on Bin Laden's page.
[01:00:39.805 --> 01:00:50.449]  So it's the no big deal approach, but it's inconsistent with the fact that it took less than three months to criminally indict Bin Laden after the 98 embassy bombings and now we're nearly
[01:00:51.129 --> 01:01:10.273]  Five years after 9-11 and no criminal indictment has taken place, there's no discussion of it taking place, then it won't take place because even if it's a cover-up sham like the 9-11 Commission, it will still provide embarrassing results for anyone looking into 9-11 because the truth is always hidden in plain view.
[01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:18.154]  Because even if they appoint a new Whitewash Commission, the kind of yarns that they'll try to spin to explain the official version of events
[01:01:19.326 --> 01:01:25.090]  will be implausible on their own, because we can prove that the official version is a lie.
[01:01:26.571 --> 01:01:46.905]  Well, we can, Paul, and it's just, how they'll take incredible things like this, with the FBI agents saying, we can't prove Bin Laden did it, and then that's just kind of, well, that doesn't matter, and then Buzzy Krongard, number three at CIA a few years ago, connected into insider trading, by the way, tells the Times of London, oh, we don't want to capture him,
[01:01:47.759 --> 01:01:53.121]  And of course, it's well known he's been dead since early 2002 at the latest of kidney failure.
[01:01:54.202 --> 01:01:57.883]  And then meanwhile, the Carlisle Group, with the Bin Laden family, has made all this money off the war.
[01:01:57.943 --> 01:02:01.125]  They're deep British intelligence agents going back to 1918.
[01:02:01.225 --> 01:02:05.767]  I just don't know where this ends.
[01:02:05.827 --> 01:02:07.307]  The thing is such a hoax.
[01:02:07.787 --> 01:02:11.129]  I know a lot of the public are starting to wake up to this, but everybody should wake up.
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:37.130]  And remember how they, for the first three or four months, said Bin Laden, Bin Laden, we're going to smoke him out of his hole, we're going to get him, and then suddenly Bush said, I'm not worried about Bin Laden, forget about Bin Laden, the media is focusing on Bin Laden too much, and then suddenly the media quit talking about Bin Laden, and they rolled out Saddam as if he was Bin Laden, and shifted the hate from Goldstein A to Goldstein B, that is Saddam Hussein.
[01:02:38.351 --> 01:02:39.331]  Yeah, and of course, because
[01:02:40.049 --> 01:02:46.815]  In polls, it was found that almost 50% of Americans confused Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
[01:02:46.835 --> 01:02:48.396]  They thought he was the same person.
[01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:52.980]  And now they've moved off of that from Saddam to Ahmadinejad.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.325]  Yeah, Ahmadinejad's the new Hitler, just as Bush's daddy said Saddam Hussein was the new Hitler in 2002.
[01:03:00.586 --> 01:03:03.188]  Isn't it interesting that the US and Israel's
[01:03:03.763 --> 01:03:06.104]  Next target is always the new Hitler.
[01:03:06.144 --> 01:03:08.344]  Whoever it may be, it's always the new Hitler.
[01:03:08.364 --> 01:03:14.566]  But meanwhile, the grandfather of the Boshes was the top Nazi agent in the US and was even indicted for it.
[01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:15.767]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:03:16.467 --> 01:03:17.807]  No, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:18.328]  It's not true.
[01:03:20.302 --> 01:03:23.785]  And all the Washington Post forwards as evidence.
[01:03:23.845 --> 01:03:30.090]  They allude to the Bin Laden tape as confession, even though Bin Laden's first interview said he had nothing to do with 9-11.
[01:03:30.471 --> 01:03:32.553]  And the video in itself is a fraud.
[01:03:32.613 --> 01:03:36.416]  It's not even Bin Laden if he's done any kind of cursory analysis on it.
[01:03:36.616 --> 01:03:37.497]  Paul, great job.
[01:03:37.537 --> 01:03:39.298]  It's always good to have you on with us, my friend.
[01:03:39.318 --> 01:03:40.339]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:03:40.359 --> 01:03:43.302]  We'll watch your great work over at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:43.322 --> 01:03:43.742]  Take care.
[01:03:44.122 --> 01:03:44.683]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:03:45.023 --> 01:03:45.404]  You bet.
[01:03:45.444 --> 01:03:46.985]  We'll be right back with Les Chamberson.
[01:03:56.995 --> 01:03:57.476]  It's here.
[01:03:57.696 --> 01:04:02.441]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.841 --> 01:04:10.429]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.172 --> 01:04:18.217]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.617 --> 01:04:30.045]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.345 --> 01:04:33.867]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:36.249]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:40.352]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:08.496]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:08.616 --> 01:05:20.139]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:05:20.519 --> 01:05:27.924]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.

[01:05:49.038 --> 01:05:50.299]  That's toll-free, triple
[01:05:53.541 --> 01:06:00.384]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[01:06:00.644 --> 01:06:06.206]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[01:06:06.527 --> 01:06:13.090]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:20.113]  This patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[01:06:20.373 --> 01:06:29.420]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:33.122]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:36.845]  Its many self-sufficient and high security features will amaze you.
[01:06:37.205 --> 01:06:44.553]  With Nuclear World War 3 looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey ready for a new owner.

[01:06:49.177 --> 01:06:52.060]  That's www.ultimatesecurehome.com.
[01:06:53.502 --> 01:06:58.525]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.926 --> 01:07:01.207]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.547 --> 01:07:19.439]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:19.479 --> 01:07:22.521]  We're scheduled to have Patrick and Jay Buchanan on in the third hour.
[01:07:23.397 --> 01:07:27.320]  State of emergency already on the New York Times, number one on their bestseller list.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.141]  We are in a state of emergency.
[01:07:29.161 --> 01:07:33.644]  Right now we're honored to be joined by Les Jamison.
[01:07:33.664 --> 01:07:40.568]  You can see a clip of him talking there at Ground Zero about 9-11 being an inside job in my film, Martial Law.
[01:07:41.289 --> 01:07:44.971]  And he has been one of the prime movers in New York with 9-11 Truth.
[01:07:45.772 --> 01:07:49.234]  Heading up that organization there, really doing a great job exposing this crime.
[01:07:50.498 --> 01:07:54.320]  And they've got big events coming up in about, what, a week and a half.
[01:07:55.461 --> 01:08:04.547]  They're in New York starting on September 8th through the 11th, culminating at Ground Zero with the boys from Loose Change and many others.
[01:08:04.867 --> 01:08:15.334]  By the way, they've got a really great artist, graphic artist production of myself and Dylan Avery and Cory Rowe.
[01:08:16.201 --> 01:08:17.162]  Good to go!
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.482]  We're really thrilled about the whole weekend.
[01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:34.844]  We're thrilled that you and your crew will be joining us, Alex.
[01:08:34.864 --> 01:08:36.686]  We're billing this as the 9-11 Truth Breakthrough Weekend.
[01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:02.332]  Because that's exactly what is in order.
[01:09:03.112 --> 01:09:28.687]  A truth breakthrough and the series of events that we're planning and with the people that we have that will be participating will be bringing their knowledge, their expertise, their vision, and their encouragement to basically catapult us into the fifth anniversary, you know, the month of the fifth year anniversary and
[01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:52.913]  Into the fall, and that's exactly the way we have to be envisioning the work before us, where we break the case, we pierce the lie, the big lie, and we shatter the existing systems, you know, the government and the media's, you know, monopoly over the
[01:09:56.584 --> 01:10:06.788]  Let's see, the venues and the mechanisms of mind control and propaganda, we have to just break all of that, and that's exactly what we're taking this on for.
[01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:12.651]  Les, I want to get into all the events that are coming up and talk about some of the new 9-11 information that's coming out.
[01:10:12.731 --> 01:10:23.315]  Mainstream news about new EPA whistleblowers, about all the asbestos and killing the firemen and police, and now of course debilitating and sickening thousands more, including New Yorkers.
[01:10:24.071 --> 01:10:26.392]  And I mean, that's something that you can't debate.
[01:10:27.112 --> 01:10:29.852]  That shows the cold-blooded, calculated nature.
[01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:43.376]  In fact, a lot of mainstream reports are now saying that over time, in the aggregate, that the dust may kill more people than actually died on 9-11, the 2,700 or so that died at the World Trade Center.
[01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:44.136]  But before we go there,
[01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:52.528]  You know, I have a pretty good sense of things because I go off all the data.
[01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:54.469]  I eat, breathe, and drink this stuff.
[01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:59.112]  But I see breakthroughs on 9-11 Truth everywhere, at every level.
[01:10:59.132 --> 01:11:00.153]  I mean, let me just give you an example.
[01:11:00.713 --> 01:11:02.134]  I can go to foreign cities now.
[01:11:02.255 --> 01:11:04.896]  London, New York, L.A., Chicago.
[01:11:04.997 --> 01:11:08.959]  I can be walking down the street at the mall or at the bus station.
[01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:11.641]  People who aren't with us go, Hey, Alex Jones!
[01:11:11.661 --> 01:11:12.402]  Hey, Alex Jones!
[01:11:13.211 --> 01:11:14.615]  Well, I can be with the loose change guys.
[01:11:14.635 --> 01:11:17.903]  I mean, most Americans don't even know what top directors look like.
[01:11:17.944 --> 01:11:21.212]  These are, you know, young men and people are recognizing them.
[01:11:21.312 --> 01:11:21.814]  People are going,
[01:11:23.067 --> 01:11:26.269]  I'm talking about we're on a train with 20 people and 5 of them know us.
[01:11:27.109 --> 01:11:33.753]  Last night I pull up to eat at a Chinese food restaurant with these BBC guys afterwards and there's no parking so we valet park.
[01:11:34.113 --> 01:11:37.475]  The valet parking guy goes, no I'm not taking your money and I go, oh yes you are, he's a fan.
[01:11:37.755 --> 01:11:39.676]  The other valet guy runs up, he's a fan.
[01:11:40.076 --> 01:11:42.137]  I walk in, the girl at the front counter is a fan.
[01:11:42.157 --> 01:11:43.318]  It's a restaurant I never go to.
[01:11:43.978 --> 01:11:44.598]  Yes, we are.
[01:12:04.342 --> 01:12:07.523]  I mean, it's really not right.
[01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:17.447]  I said this last year and suddenly I got a ticket from a cop I didn't know, but I speed around town and cops pull me over and they go, oh Alex Jones, just don't speed Alex, get out of here.
[01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:21.209]  And hey, we know what's going on, or hey, we're not all bad.
[01:12:21.609 --> 01:12:25.511]  I mean, I'm running into this everywhere and now we've got
[01:12:26.403 --> 01:12:43.118]  News, which is in the top 100 rock and roll bands right now, very high on the charts in England, very popular here wearing a Terror Storm t-shirt that they made themselves on BBC, broadcast all over England and many areas of the world at one of the biggest music festivals of the year.
[01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.860]  And they say, what's Terror Storm about?
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.883]  And they say, we'll go to Google Video and type it in and you'll find out.
[01:12:47.923 --> 01:12:50.085]  I mean, again, there's hundreds of other indicators.
[01:12:50.385 --> 01:13:08.777]  We're having breakthroughs everywhere, is the point I'm making, and I see the establishment starting to panic with the 9-11 hit pieces against us, and the neocon stories in World End Daily, and Popular Mechanics with this new book out, and John McCain, you know, panicking and writing the foreword and saying that basically we're taking over.
[01:13:09.097 --> 01:13:11.479]  I mean, and they seem fearful when they're writing.
[01:13:11.499 --> 01:13:13.080]  They're saying, these guys are dangerous.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.501]  No, you're dangerous!
[01:13:14.801 --> 01:13:17.903]  Those of you that try to cover this up, you inadvertently, if you're not
[01:13:20.264 --> 01:13:28.628]  Yes, absolutely Alex.
[01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:31.809]  We've experienced that many times in New York.
[01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:38.273]  I'm wearing the Investigate 9-11 loose change t-shirt and I go up to a cashier.
[01:13:39.773 --> 01:13:40.594]  This actually happened.
[01:13:40.614 --> 01:13:45.436]  I was in a video store, a big one in Manhattan.
[01:13:45.476 --> 01:13:47.357]  Hundreds and hundreds of people fit in this store.
[01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:52.511]  I go up to pay and the cashier sees my t-shirt and says, oh yeah, I saw loose change.
[01:13:52.992 --> 01:13:59.437]  Walking down the street wearing a t-shirt, a different 9-11 t-shirt, people come up to me and say, yeah, oh yeah, I saw loose change.
[01:13:59.938 --> 01:14:07.725]  And at Ground Zero, where we are every Saturday, we hold a vigil there, or I actually should call it an outreach action.
[01:14:07.785 --> 01:14:11.048]  Every Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m., we've been doing this for
[01:14:11.633 --> 01:14:15.615]  Three years, and meet people, Alex, from all over the world.
[01:14:15.655 --> 01:14:28.399]  I've met people from as far as like Malaysia, Australia, Indonesia, and of course all throughout Europe and Central America, who know that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:14:28.439 --> 01:14:35.642]  They know that this has been a pretext for war, a catalyzing factor.
[01:14:35.682 --> 01:14:38.283]  They instinctively know, not just all the evidence.
[01:14:38.323 --> 01:14:40.184]  We all instinctively know.
[01:14:40.951 --> 01:14:44.314]  Yeah, and for instance, I met a young guy from Italy recently.
[01:14:44.334 --> 01:14:50.038]  He said that one of the American 9-11 truth websites was translated into Italian.
[01:14:50.899 --> 01:14:54.701]  So, and the same thing in the Spanish language I found.
[01:14:54.742 --> 01:15:06.631]  So, and here in the US, indicated by the recent polls, especially since May of this year, you know, we have absolutely permeated consciousness in the United States.
[01:15:06.691 --> 01:15:08.232]  So, the question now is,
[01:15:09.549 --> 01:15:12.932]  Well, for us, we have to recognize, okay, now we're in a new phase.
[01:15:13.392 --> 01:15:16.195]  How do we connect with these people out there?
[01:15:16.235 --> 01:15:17.816]  There's 70 to 80 million people.
[01:15:18.777 --> 01:15:29.046]  Give them whatever remaining information that they need and then mobilize, catalyze them into taking concentrated and concerted actions.
[01:15:30.691 --> 01:15:39.657]  Especially in a coordinated fashion, because that's where we can show the huge constituency that we are, and we can bring political pressure to bear.
[01:15:40.818 --> 01:15:42.739]  And I think that's the next stage that we're in.
[01:15:42.759 --> 01:15:45.641]  Well, I want to be clear to the government analysts listening right now.
[01:15:46.562 --> 01:15:57.269]  Number one, you may engage in all sorts of mental gymnastics to deny what we're saying, or go look at the more ridiculous 9-11 questions that are out there and then try to associate that psychologically with all of us.
[01:15:58.745 --> 01:16:02.708]  I just want to tell you that we've researched this, we've looked at this, we know this is an inside job.
[01:16:03.168 --> 01:16:06.271]  You should research it and you shouldn't be part of this system.
[01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:10.854]  The same people that carried out 9-11 are the people creating the North American Union.
[01:16:11.335 --> 01:16:14.697]  They're the people that are putting toxins in our vaccines.
[01:16:14.717 --> 01:16:22.664]  They're the people that let the firemen and police breathe all that asbestos and then didn't give them treatment or even take care of them as they're dead and dying and being maimed from this.
[01:16:23.164 --> 01:16:23.964]  Shame on you!
[01:16:24.424 --> 01:16:27.145]  And stop your talk of, we're doing this for the greater good.
[01:16:27.445 --> 01:16:38.487]  You know, the government carried out the attacks because 3,000 dead is better than the Islamists taking over, and we had to do this to have the catalyzing event to beat them, or they're going to destroy Western culture.
[01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:45.748]  The very people that carried out 9-11 are the ones bringing in unmetered levels of foreign cultures to destroy the West.
[01:16:46.048 --> 01:16:48.669]  They're the ones destroying the basic canons of the West.
[01:16:49.549 --> 01:16:50.369]  It's baloney!
[01:16:51.029 --> 01:17:02.233]  So, there's a lot of evil people listening to this show right now who know the government carried it out, but believe that they are so good that they're able to use evil to protect good.
[01:17:02.253 --> 01:17:04.793]  I know the mental alchemy you guys engage in.
[01:17:05.173 --> 01:17:05.674]  Stop it!
[01:17:06.354 --> 01:17:06.834]  Stop it!
[01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:09.415]  What you're doing is bad for your grandma.
[01:17:09.876 --> 01:17:11.396]  It's bad for your sons and daughters.
[01:17:11.436 --> 01:17:13.016]  It's bad for you, you idiots!
[01:17:13.676 --> 01:17:15.777]  And I demand that you stop going along with this.
[01:17:15.817 --> 01:17:17.357]  I don't mean those that carried out the attacks.
[01:17:17.757 --> 01:17:20.038]  I mean those that are listening that, you know, that go along with this.
[01:17:20.058 --> 01:17:20.678]  And let me be clear.
[01:17:21.078 --> 01:17:26.219]  A Scripps Howard News Ohio University study may say 36% believe it's an inside job.
[01:17:26.719 --> 01:17:30.120]  And 40-something percent in a Zogby poll may believe it's an inside job.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:30.820]  Forty-two.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:31.220]  Yeah.
[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:36.301]  People regularly get a call and they
[01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:40.541]  Have a pollster, and the studies have shown this, I've looked at it.
[01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:49.227]  When someone's asked a very controversial answer, they will either say, not sure, or they will lie and say, no, no, I don't think it's an inside job.
[01:17:49.687 --> 01:17:53.910]  And I submit, and the evidence shows, that double whatever number you get.
[01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:57.292]  Imagine, you get a call, folks, do you believe 9-11 is an inside job?
[01:17:58.492 --> 01:18:05.793]  Most people who believe it's an inside job are still not going to tell somebody over the phone because they're afraid that they believe it's an inside job.
[01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:10.054]  So I submit it's more like eighty percent less.
[01:18:11.575 --> 01:18:13.375]  Yeah, very, very likely.
[01:18:13.395 --> 01:18:24.837]  And this is one of the main goals and I think if we continue to put out the information, Alex, that make it
[01:18:25.831 --> 01:18:46.947]  Crystal clear in a very manageable fashion of how the government is complicit, how they're guilty of everything from dereliction of duty to obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, which are all legally prosecutable crimes.
[01:18:47.527 --> 01:18:48.048]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:18:48.068 --> 01:18:51.951]  Let's talk about that because we've got them dead to rights on a bunch of issues.
[01:18:51.971 --> 01:18:52.331]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.346 --> 01:18:59.571]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:59.731 --> 01:19:07.818]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:08.079 --> 01:19:15.125]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:15.265 --> 01:19:15.905]  We're good to go!
[01:19:45.516 --> 01:19:59.948]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:05.932]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:06.153 --> 01:20:08.895]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:08.935 --> 01:20:10.016]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:11.371 --> 01:20:15.954]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:16.894 --> 01:20:24.158]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:25.159 --> 01:20:28.221]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:28.461 --> 01:20:33.844]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:34.805 --> 01:20:36.085]  Call for your copy today.
[01:20:36.105 --> 01:20:36.305]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.591 --> 01:20:45.433]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:48.594]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.674 --> 01:20:52.216]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.557 --> 01:20:57.057]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.738 --> 01:21:06.281]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:12.211]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:15.112]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:15.512 --> 01:21:16.332]  There may be more.
[01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:24.274]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:21:24.954 --> 01:21:32.796]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:35.177]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800
[01:21:36.715 --> 01:21:36.815]  516-8736.
[01:21:36.835 --> 01:21:37.536]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:37.596 --> 01:21:37.797]  Call now.
[01:21:37.937 --> 01:21:41.502]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[01:21:53.911 --> 01:21:59.915]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:02.977]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:03.137 --> 01:22:07.760]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.744]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:22:12.924 --> 01:22:17.667]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:22:17.887 --> 01:22:20.549]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:20.789 --> 01:22:23.671]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:22:24.951 --> 01:22:25.952]  Looking for profits?
[01:22:26.032 --> 01:22:27.432]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:22:27.752 --> 01:22:30.613]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:22:31.013 --> 01:22:38.275]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:22:38.635 --> 01:22:42.156]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:22:42.396 --> 01:22:43.917]  Secure your position today.
[01:22:44.217 --> 01:22:45.397]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.477 --> 01:22:45.717]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.093 --> 01:23:09.058]  The number one thing you have to know going into any fight is who your enemy is, what their capabilities are, what their past actions have been.
[01:23:09.078 --> 01:23:11.740]  That'll give you an index and a road map to follow.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.922]  But you can't always totally trust in that because they can change tactics at any time.
[01:23:16.122 --> 01:23:19.524]  Though this enemy is so psychotic, they repeat the same thing over and over again.
[01:23:19.544 --> 01:23:20.485]  That's their greatest weakness.
[01:23:21.385 --> 01:23:24.947]  Evil people follow patterns unlike any other strata of society I've ever seen.
[01:23:25.628 --> 01:23:27.109]  Not just in history, but currently.
[01:23:27.989 --> 01:23:30.591]  And then you also have to know you can win.
[01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:40.833]  I mean, when somebody's bearing down on you, trying to beat your brains out in a physical fight, which is analogous to this, and you don't have a choice, you might as well go 110%.
[01:23:40.873 --> 01:23:46.738]  And a lot of you I know in life have been surprised that when you did go 110%, when you went 100%, it was the bully who got his teeth knocked out.
[01:23:51.434 --> 01:23:52.674]  Well, it's the same thing with the New World Order.
[01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:58.356]  You've just got to be willing to fight, willing to go, willing to go head up, and when you go head up with them, go 110%.
[01:23:59.057 --> 01:24:01.718]  Les Jamison of New York 9-11 Truth will give out your website in a moment.
[01:24:01.738 --> 01:24:04.839]  We've got links to it on InfoWars.com.
[01:24:04.859 --> 01:24:05.939]  Finish up the point you were making.
[01:24:07.039 --> 01:24:20.184]  Yes, the government is guilty of everything from dereliction of duty to destruction of evidence, obstruction of evidence, and of course
[01:24:20.976 --> 01:24:21.556]  We're good to go.
[01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:40.361]  You're talking about Al Capone.
[01:24:40.401 --> 01:24:45.645]  I mean, will we ever prove exactly what they did with the hijackers and how the exact attack carried out?
[01:24:45.745 --> 01:24:45.985]  No.
[01:24:46.086 --> 01:24:47.707]  Can we prove the obstructed justice?
[01:24:48.007 --> 01:24:49.769]  Can we prove they covered up and lied?
[01:24:49.809 --> 01:24:51.150]  Can we prove that they perjured?
[01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:51.750]  Yes.
[01:24:52.471 --> 01:24:53.091]  Absolutely.
[01:24:53.171 --> 01:25:03.339]  I mean, it's rife with those exact crimes from all the foreknowledge right through to the investigation, the fraudulent investigation.
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:04.901]  These are all criminal acts.
[01:25:04.921 --> 01:25:06.182]  So, you know, Alex,
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:20.027]  In terms of coming up with strategy, these are things that I think about, which is, how do we realistically, pragmatically carry our work forward?
[01:25:20.287 --> 01:25:35.855]  And these are the, I think, the levels and the terms that we need to be thinking in, which is that there are legal crimes that, I'm sorry, there are these crimes that are legally
[01:25:36.663 --> 01:25:54.476]  We have to have terms in which we can put before a court and a jury and say that, you know, here's the evidence for obstruction of justice, you know, and destruction of evidence, dereliction of duty, all the foreknowledge.
[01:25:54.496 --> 01:26:03.703]  And we don't have time to go into detail, but people listening, I think, don't have to think very far to fill in the blanks themselves.
[01:26:05.074 --> 01:26:13.157]  Prison and crimes against humanity because of the 3,000 murders on that day and the wars that ensued since.
[01:26:13.857 --> 01:26:27.301]  And the way 9-11 was used to justify their imperial agenda abroad and their agenda for domination and theft of our civil liberties at home.
[01:26:27.841 --> 01:26:33.643]  So I hope that people in the movement are thinking in these terms because
[01:26:34.454 --> 01:26:37.535]  This is where we can now focus.
[01:26:37.795 --> 01:26:48.740]  We've permeated consciousness throughout the United States and abroad, and we've got to be thinking in terms of the next phase of action, and we have to focus.
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:27:01.646]  In this upcoming fifth anniversary, I'm hoping that the event here in New York will show us the exact areas that we need to focus on, as opposed to
[01:27:02.999 --> 01:27:12.121]  You know, being very scattered and overly complex in our analysis and our approach to applying solutions.
[01:27:13.581 --> 01:27:22.723]  Well, I think it's good to bring up solutions and come up with strategies, but I think it also makes us very strong, the fact that there are so many different groups and organizations hitting them from so many different angles.
[01:27:22.763 --> 01:27:28.064]  I know you're trying to talk about more of just a general mindset and general plan, a type of manifesto.
[01:27:31.265 --> 01:27:45.721]  Sure, we've got half the people now conservatively, but I think now it gets even easier with half the people to try to mobilize them to be leaders and not just count on Les Jamison or Paul Watson or
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:52.084]  Or, you know, Jim Fetzer or Webster Tarpley or Alex Jones to go out and do it.
[01:27:52.144 --> 01:28:03.673]  I think now it is, you know, up to prominent people, individuals, school teachers, it doesn't matter, at every level of society to force and multiply the information in their sector.
[01:28:04.373 --> 01:28:05.214]  Yes, yes.
[01:28:05.474 --> 01:28:10.858]  We have veterans out there now, we have peace groups, by the way, great news.
[01:28:11.759 --> 01:28:13.540]  And we've been trying to reach out to
[01:28:14.025 --> 01:28:22.470]  There's peace groups, anti-war groups for a number of years now, and finally, we have an organization called Peace Action, which is in 37 states.
[01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:32.096]  They've been around since the Vietnam War in the 70s, and they have recently added the issue of 9-11 Truth to their platform.
[01:28:33.457 --> 01:28:35.398]  I want to hear about it on the other side.
[01:28:35.478 --> 01:28:41.762]  More pastors, more artists, more musicians, more school teachers going public.
[01:28:44.122 --> 01:28:47.108]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:50.734]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.366 --> 01:28:58.488]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[01:28:58.808 --> 01:29:00.829]  And check this out, I bought a new car.
[01:29:00.929 --> 01:29:06.174]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[01:29:06.734 --> 01:29:10.877]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did and you were right.
[01:29:11.198 --> 01:29:16.102]  I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:29:16.522 --> 01:29:18.984]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:29:19.284 --> 01:29:22.647]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[01:29:22.867 --> 01:29:23.768]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[01:29:24.108 --> 01:29:26.509]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[01:29:26.849 --> 01:29:29.109]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:29.890]  It's incredible!
[01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:37.712]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[01:29:38.052 --> 01:29:42.993]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:43.594 --> 01:29:44.294]  Check, please.
[01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:45.634]  I got this one, Bill.
[01:29:46.034 --> 01:29:46.714]  Sure, John.
[01:29:46.854 --> 01:29:51.456]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:51.596 --> 01:29:51.856]  Deal.
[01:29:55.532 --> 01:29:56.572]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:29:56.912 --> 01:29:59.673]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:29:59.953 --> 01:30:04.094]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:30:04.534 --> 01:30:05.355]  So what do you do?
[01:30:05.675 --> 01:30:10.276]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:30:10.736 --> 01:30:12.857]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:30:13.357 --> 01:30:14.217]  Sheltering in place.
[01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:28.050]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:35.214]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:38.676]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:30:40.337 --> 01:30:44.640]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:48.542]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:48.882 --> 01:30:51.664]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:30:54.245 --> 01:30:56.747]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:30:56.847 --> 01:30:59.228]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:06.372]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[01:31:06.933 --> 01:31:09.114]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:09.893 --> 01:31:13.415]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.976 --> 01:31:18.118]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:18.679 --> 01:31:21.681]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:22.641 --> 01:31:25.543]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:26.284 --> 01:31:28.365]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:28.385 --> 01:31:30.727]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:39.901 --> 01:31:40.181]  U.S.
[01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:43.163]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[01:31:44.163 --> 01:31:52.048]  Call 888-XANADU, that's 888-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:57.691]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.711 --> 01:32:01.553]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.212 --> 01:32:10.193]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:13.974]  Thank you so much for joining us on the front lines of the battle for the Republic.
[01:32:15.094 --> 01:32:17.074]  We're going to open the phones up here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:17.114 --> 01:32:20.975]  I'm going to take a lot of your calls on 9-11, the police state, the American Union.
[01:32:21.515 --> 01:32:23.376]  Any issue you wish to discuss, toll free 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:23.396 --> 01:32:23.456]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:23.476 --> 01:32:24.636]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[01:32:24.656 --> 01:32:25.736]  Before we go back to Les Jamieson.
[01:32:33.889 --> 01:32:34.470]  A few items.
[01:32:35.211 --> 01:32:37.674]  A great success sell-out crowd in Dallas.
[01:32:37.734 --> 01:32:41.999]  I'm going to have five showings of Terror Storm coming up next month on the 5th, 6th, and 7th.
[01:32:42.399 --> 01:32:47.926]  And then on the 13th and the 14th of September, five showings, Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:32:47.946 --> 01:32:52.652]  Get your tickets at InfoWars.com before these events sell out as well.
[01:32:54.122 --> 01:32:58.986]  And all of our Alamo Graftow showings have sold out within a day of the event.
[01:32:59.046 --> 01:33:02.168]  So if you want to see it in Austin, folks, get your tickets now.
[01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:02.729]  Don't wait.
[01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:04.110]  Hope to see you there.
[01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:06.512]  I'll be giving a speech and taking questions after each showing.
[01:33:07.012 --> 01:33:08.353]  Five of those showings coming up.
[01:33:08.774 --> 01:33:10.355]  Get a copy of Terror Storm.
[01:33:10.415 --> 01:33:11.916]  Go to infowars.com.
[01:33:14.281 --> 01:33:17.402]  And the new official, you know, I put out the emergency release for about a month.
[01:33:17.442 --> 01:33:20.842]  It didn't have the extras, but now we have it with all the extras.
[01:33:21.122 --> 01:33:27.443]  66 minutes from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium out in Los Angeles in June, late June.
[01:33:27.823 --> 01:33:29.264]  That is on the end of the video.
[01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:31.804]  So it is a little over three hours long.
[01:33:31.844 --> 01:33:37.165]  The film is right under two hours and then 66 minutes of extras on the new film.
[01:33:37.285 --> 01:33:43.486]  You need to get your copy of Terror Storm today and then make high-quality DVD copies from it.
[01:33:43.726 --> 01:33:49.968]  Buy the DVD, get it, dump it on the DVD, on the VHS, whatever you have to do.
[01:33:50.449 --> 01:33:52.189]  Aggressively get the film.
[01:33:52.409 --> 01:33:54.630]  Aggressively make copies.
[01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:58.172]  Aggressively prosecute the war against the globalists.
[01:33:58.532 --> 01:33:59.172]  Never stop.
[01:33:59.272 --> 01:34:01.333]  Folks, it hurts them so badly.
[01:34:02.757 --> 01:34:14.671]  When you get my videos and you make copies and you give them to your pastors, your neighbors, your friends, when you put them on the car's windshields at the YMCA or at churches,
[01:34:15.867 --> 01:34:22.808]  I mean, you can burn copies of DVDs, depending on how fast your burner is, in a couple minutes, or 30 minutes, depending on the DVD burner.
[01:34:23.108 --> 01:34:33.690]  You can just sit there while you're watching TV, or on the computer, or doing your taxes, or whatever it is, and you can just sit there and just burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
[01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:41.672]  You could easily, easily make 5-10 copies a day, or just make one copy a day, and give it to everyone you know.
[01:34:42.975 --> 01:34:44.996]  The effect of this is unbelievable.
[01:34:45.056 --> 01:34:50.178]  So get your original high-quality DVDs at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:50.198 --> 01:34:50.778]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:56.960]  Now, if you go to Google Video and you type in Terror Storm, you will see... I don't know, I checked it this morning.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:00.921]  There were like 15 different versions of Terror Storm.
[01:35:13.044 --> 01:35:20.506]  The first ones that were uploaded by listeners are not very good quality.
[01:35:21.827 --> 01:35:22.187]  Okay?
[01:35:22.747 --> 01:35:32.670]  And I still appreciate them doing that, but it wasn't uploaded right, and by the time Google downgrades the quality again, it's not very good.
[01:35:34.858 --> 01:35:48.348]  You've got to go down into the list of terror storms you'll see listed and you've got to find the ones that say deluxe or high quality and the way you can tell if it's a high bandwidth version or is it's really medium bandwidth.
[01:35:48.748 --> 01:35:49.949]  The best is medium bandwidth.
[01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:57.935]  You will look and when it says the Orwell quote at the start, oh it's actually an Alexander Schultz and Itza quote at the start, it's Orwell at the end.
[01:36:00.137 --> 01:36:01.458]  When you see the quote
[01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:10.625]  At the first of the film, you will be able to read the small text with the good quality version.
[01:36:11.066 --> 01:36:13.147]  That is the one to email out to everyone.
[01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:15.848]  That is the one that we uploaded.
[01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:18.730]  We uploaded it in the highest quality version.
[01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:20.271]  It took like a day to upload it.
[01:36:21.832 --> 01:36:23.953]  And then Google still downgraded it.
[01:36:24.374 --> 01:36:26.555]  But it's medium quality.
[01:36:27.395 --> 01:36:28.336]  That is the one.
[01:36:28.496 --> 01:36:29.657]  The bad copies
[01:36:30.982 --> 01:36:37.808]  The low-grade quality, and I'm really upset about this, but that's the way it is, is the one that millions of people are watching.
[01:36:38.409 --> 01:36:38.689]  Okay?
[01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:39.750]  And it's not as effective.
[01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:40.951]  You can't see all the documents.
[01:36:40.991 --> 01:36:41.932]  It isn't as good a view.
[01:36:42.553 --> 01:36:48.819]  It's up to you folks, because whatever gets the most traffic goes to the top, to get out the high-quality version to everyone.
[01:36:48.939 --> 01:36:49.259]  Okay?
[01:36:51.201 --> 01:36:53.944]  Now, why should you be a PrisonPlanet.tv member?
[01:36:55.567 --> 01:37:02.910]  Because we uploaded it in that highest quality for PrisonPlanet.TV members and it didn't get transferred down by Google.
[01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:03.490]  You understand?
[01:37:03.991 --> 01:37:05.631]  They are super high quality.
[01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:08.672]  It looks almost as good as a DVD.
[01:37:09.153 --> 01:37:11.454]  If you've got a cable modem or a T1.
[01:37:11.494 --> 01:37:15.095]  You've got a cable system feeding you.
[01:37:15.495 --> 01:37:16.676]  You've got a dial if you can't watch it.
[01:37:16.716 --> 01:37:18.797]  We have it in low, medium, and then high for you.
[01:37:19.417 --> 01:37:22.258]  For those that don't have super high quality connections.
[01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:23.901]  Super Fast Connections.
[01:37:25.082 --> 01:37:35.386]  When you go there, when you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member, the download, we put a super high quality one of TerrorStorm up, it is so high quality, it's better than what you'll get on Google or anywhere else.
[01:37:35.827 --> 01:37:40.049]  That's why for activists, you've got to be PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:43.830]  Because you're going to get quality there you're not going to get from Google Video.
[01:37:44.611 --> 01:37:46.952]  And so, burn it onto CDs.
[01:37:47.652 --> 01:37:49.753]  You can burn TerrorStorm onto CDs
[01:37:50.846 --> 01:37:55.170]  Off the downloads, you get off the website when you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:59.113]  And, you know, it's kind of a catch-22 here for us.
[01:37:59.233 --> 01:38:00.474]  We want to get the word out.
[01:38:00.514 --> 01:38:02.075]  We want it all to be free.
[01:38:03.016 --> 01:38:05.898]  We could never do that because we couldn't afford the bandwidth.
[01:38:06.398 --> 01:38:14.805]  Google Video came along, and so we're able to just upload it up there for you, but then it's a catch-22 because then we won't make any money and won't be here.
[01:38:15.505 --> 01:38:20.469]  So when you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member, you make this broadcast possible.
[01:38:21.388 --> 01:38:29.513]  And you get all 15 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, special video reports, my films, weeks before they're even released.
[01:38:29.933 --> 01:38:35.777]  It's such a great value, 15 cents a day, get a monthly subscription for $5.95 at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:38:35.837 --> 01:38:47.044]  But it's such an activist center because you can go download super high quality versions of my TV shows, Terror Storm, all of it, burn them to disk and give them to people.
[01:38:47.604 --> 01:38:49.465]  It is such an effective activist center.
[01:38:49.585 --> 01:38:52.066]  Please use this resource.
[01:38:52.647 --> 01:38:54.368]  And for all the members out there, thank you.
[01:38:54.688 --> 01:38:56.549]  Your membership is making everything possible.
[01:38:57.329 --> 01:39:00.431]  Right now, we couldn't operate without PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:01.331 --> 01:39:05.573]  I spent so much money on the fight that we would be in the rears if it wasn't for your memberships there.
[01:39:05.974 --> 01:39:06.754]  So, thank you.
[01:39:07.634 --> 01:39:08.715]  Alright, enough of that.
[01:39:08.735 --> 01:39:12.237]  I just wanted to... I didn't plug it last hour, so I double-plugged it right there.
[01:39:13.777 --> 01:39:16.499]  Let's go back to Les Jameson and into your calls.
[01:39:16.899 --> 01:39:17.900]  Again, the number 800-259-9231.
[01:39:20.762 --> 01:39:27.067]  Les, tell us about the roster, what's coming up in New York through the 8th through the 11th.
[01:39:27.107 --> 01:39:29.669]  I'll be there from the 9th through the 11th.
[01:39:30.349 --> 01:39:32.471]  Tell us about what's going to happen in New York.
[01:39:33.171 --> 01:39:34.312]  Okay, yeah, thanks Alex.
[01:39:35.533 --> 01:39:38.815]  Starting on Friday evening at St.
[01:39:38.835 --> 01:39:39.396]  Mark's Church
[01:39:40.194 --> 01:39:52.244]  In the East Village, we have a very interesting event which is going to be about how 9-11 was the pretext for war that we've been experiencing ever since that year, 2001.
[01:39:52.284 --> 01:39:56.687]  And we have a 9-11 vet for truth.
[01:39:58.429 --> 01:39:59.429]  I say that wrong.
[01:39:59.449 --> 01:40:03.773]  It's a vet for 9-11 truth by the name of Alphonse Olszewski.
[01:40:03.993 --> 01:40:04.834]  He's a Vietnam vet.
[01:40:05.723 --> 01:40:11.546]  And he's part of this new organization of veterans who are working to get the truth out about 9-11.
[01:40:11.606 --> 01:40:23.452]  Also, we'll have Corey Rowe, who's an Iraqi war vet, and also producer of Loose Change, and he has an awful lot to tell about his experience there, and it's just riveting.
[01:40:24.112 --> 01:40:30.155]  And also we have a woman whose son is currently in Iraq, and she's with an organization called World Can't Wait.
[01:40:30.295 --> 01:40:32.056]  Her name's Elaine Brower.
[01:40:32.076 --> 01:40:34.297]  And then we'll have Ralph Schoenman,
[01:40:34.875 --> 01:40:57.107]  Speaking about how 9-11 paved the way for the current Middle East crisis, the current horrific aggression that's been happening between Israel and Lebanon and Hezbollah, and I think that's really a key way to open the weekend to show how 9-11 has been used as a pretext for war, aggression, death, and devastation.
[01:40:57.662 --> 01:41:02.283]  Then on Saturday afternoon, well first let me say, Saturday at 11 a.m.
[01:41:02.303 --> 01:41:07.205]  we're going to have a citywide outreach action where people will be meeting in Union Square.
[01:41:07.965 --> 01:41:12.587]  And by the way, this is all on our website which is ny911truth.org.
[01:41:12.607 --> 01:41:14.727]  You'll see all the full schedule.
[01:41:15.467 --> 01:41:20.649]  And we're going to do a big citywide outreach action where we'll have people going throughout the city.
[01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:26.771]  First meeting in Union Square, then going throughout the city to distribute literature and educate
[01:41:27.952 --> 01:41:29.253]  We're getting huge visibility.
[01:41:29.273 --> 01:41:53.447]  In the afternoon, starting 3 o'clock at Community Church, we have speakers Jim Mars, Bob Honiger, Barry Zwicker, Barry Chamish, we have also Chris Emery, and that evening, oh, and Tom Foti, and that evening we will have New York Stories, first responders, one or two of the family members, and I believe William Rodriguez will be with us.
[01:41:54.178 --> 01:42:06.146]  Then on Sunday, we have the 9-11 Truth Breakthrough Rally at Cooper Union in a very, very prestigious, large auditorium in the East Village.
[01:42:07.146 --> 01:42:22.016]  And we're going to have Bob Bowman, let's see, Professor Judy Wood, Wayne Madsen, Jim Mars, Barry Zwicker, oh, also William Pepper, the famed attorney
[01:42:22.677 --> 01:42:27.959]  Who prosecuted the investigation into the assassination of Martin Luther King.
[01:42:27.979 --> 01:42:28.979]  Well, heck, yourself!
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.840]  And we're doing two tracks that afternoon.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.501]  One for education and the other for solutions.
[01:42:34.521 --> 01:42:45.525]  And this is intended to lay out the case, to prove criminal behavior on the part of the U.S.
[01:42:45.566 --> 01:42:46.246]  government for 9-11, and then
[01:42:47.304 --> 01:42:51.227]  To provide solutions for the movement as to the next step.
[01:42:51.327 --> 01:42:54.190]  And then we're also going to show the new final edition of Loose Change.
[01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:54.930]  They're going to speak.
[01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:55.871]  I'm going to be introducing them.
[01:42:56.191 --> 01:43:00.555]  And then we're also going to have Immortal Technique, this amazing musical artist.
[01:43:01.135 --> 01:43:01.395]  Yes.
[01:43:01.495 --> 01:43:03.897]  You just described the evening event.
[01:43:04.218 --> 01:43:11.103]  Then Monday at 8 a.m., we're all gathering at Ground Zero where we'll be there for the 9-11 Truth Rally.
[01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:14.666]  We'll be there, by the way, wearing black t-shirts.
[01:43:15.367 --> 01:43:16.848]  We'll have, by the way, on Sunday,
[01:43:17.827 --> 01:43:25.412]  900 t-shirts that will be given out with the price of admission of $12 to that full event, Saturday afternoon and evening.
[01:43:25.833 --> 01:43:29.815]  Then for Monday, we're going to be there like in a sea of black t-shirts.
[01:43:30.336 --> 01:43:44.465]  They investigate 9-11 and from 8 a.m., very dignified, respectful, in solidarity with all the victims who've been affected, lost their families, their jobs, their health.
[01:43:45.322 --> 01:43:46.244]  Uh, so on and so forth.
[01:43:46.745 --> 01:43:50.152]  And, uh, then, in the afternoon, we're still, uh, fine-tuning this.
[01:43:50.332 --> 01:43:54.701]  Uh, we're talking about going over to Elie Spitzer's office, the New York Attorney General, who should have...
[01:43:56.364 --> 01:44:04.270]  I agree with the tactic, while we continue to expose all the facets of 9-11, to hit them on the stuff that's not debatable.
[01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:17.541]  And I think that the mere fact that we know the EPA reported massive asbestos, massive mercury, massive lead, again, tens of thousands of thermostats, folks, that were pulverized, filled with mercury, mercury vapors,
[01:44:18.581 --> 01:44:24.902]  Almost all of the police dogs have now died from cancer in their lungs and their nasal passages.
[01:44:25.402 --> 01:44:30.163]  Thousands of the firefighters and police have become sick and died from this.
[01:44:30.203 --> 01:44:31.783]  This is all over the news in New York.
[01:44:32.043 --> 01:44:33.564]  It's finally breaking in the mainstream news.
[01:44:33.644 --> 01:44:35.184]  EPA whistleblowers going public.
[01:44:35.444 --> 01:44:38.965]  They were ordered to just announce that the air detector said it was clean.
[01:44:39.285 --> 01:44:40.685]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[01:44:40.725 --> 01:44:42.565]  That's a key thing, I think, to bring up.
[01:44:42.625 --> 01:44:44.646]  Give us the website where people can find out details.
[01:44:44.666 --> 01:44:45.806]  Then I want to take some calls.
[01:44:45.826 --> 01:44:46.566]  Sure.
[01:44:47.754 --> 01:44:55.379]  Our organization and event schedule will be at ny911truth.org.
[01:44:55.459 --> 01:44:58.121]  ny911truth.org.
[01:44:58.181 --> 01:45:07.767]  And if somebody just wants to meet us down there on Monday morning, briefly, what time is it and what area around that wound in the ground, what area will we be meeting?
[01:45:08.387 --> 01:45:12.590]  Yes, the corner of Church and Fulton Streets.
[01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:14.711]  Is that right by the Millennium Hilton?
[01:45:15.652 --> 01:45:16.112]  Exactly.
[01:45:16.333 --> 01:45:16.933]  Right there.
[01:45:18.264 --> 01:45:18.804]  Okay.
[01:45:19.144 --> 01:45:20.605]  Alright.
[01:45:20.725 --> 01:45:22.307]  We'll be there throughout the day.
[01:45:22.327 --> 01:45:32.234]  Then, like I said, we may go to Spitzer's office and Police Plaza and then we're gathering for a 9-11 Truth Convergence and finale for food and entertainment in the evening at St.
[01:45:32.274 --> 01:45:32.854]  Mark's Church.
[01:45:33.835 --> 01:45:35.356]  Alright, I'll be there at all the events.
[01:45:35.396 --> 01:45:36.337]  Let's take calls.
[01:45:36.817 --> 01:45:41.581]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Indiana, then Wyatt, Omar, and others.
[01:45:41.621 --> 01:45:42.261]  Go ahead, George.
[01:45:42.642 --> 01:45:43.002]  Yeah.
[01:45:43.382 --> 01:45:43.963]  Great, Alex.
[01:45:44.323 --> 01:45:46.825]  I tell you, I've been watching or listening to your program for
[01:45:47.492 --> 01:45:47.672]  I don't
[01:46:05.399 --> 01:46:11.045]  Or anything, where men in suits and white shirts and ties get out there and start cleaning things up.
[01:46:11.245 --> 01:46:11.926]  Within minutes.
[01:46:11.986 --> 01:46:17.131]  No, you always have the Federal Bureau that studies all of that.
[01:46:18.639 --> 01:46:21.482]  Come out and look at it and research it and plot it all out.
[01:46:21.522 --> 01:46:24.365]  They were out there within minutes running around grabbing everything.
[01:46:24.665 --> 01:46:27.408]  And then they were sweeping it like a crime scene.
[01:46:27.428 --> 01:46:31.652]  They had a line of about 30 people walking baby steps from one end to the other.
[01:46:31.972 --> 01:46:38.999]  And then, within hours, they rush in with huge trucks of sand to dump it all over the ground because they knew it showed no wound.
[01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:40.960]  Look, I don't say don't talk about it.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.302]  We've had a lot of guests on about it.
[01:46:42.322 --> 01:46:43.563]  I put it in my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:46:43.923 --> 01:46:52.270]  My only point is, the media has tried to make this the main focus, because I think it's an area they think that will never be proven one way or the other, that they want to make the general focus.
[01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:57.073]  I want to hit all the hundreds of other points, because if you hit those, then you can convince people.
[01:46:57.934 --> 01:47:05.520]  And then that way, when the government brings out their fake video of a jet, Flight 77, or whatever they're going to do, people will know that that's a fraud.
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:09.083]  Let me get a comment from Les Jamieson on Flight 77 and the Pentagon.
[01:47:09.483 --> 01:47:09.783]  Yes.
[01:47:10.304 --> 01:47:12.005]  Well, about two months ago, of course,
[01:47:12.797 --> 01:47:17.881]  They released what was hyped to be the definitive proof.
[01:47:18.461 --> 01:47:26.868]  A new photo released and I watched for hours on Fox News as they were preparing to release this to the public.
[01:47:26.968 --> 01:47:33.733]  And this was going to be the film that would quiet all the conspiracy theories.
[01:47:34.233 --> 01:47:36.555]  Well, they showed it and folks, if you've seen it,
[01:47:37.836 --> 01:47:39.217]  It did nothing of the sort.
[01:47:39.397 --> 01:47:46.140]  If anything, it showed nothing resembling a Flight 77- Would that be like if I said- That was their chance!
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:49.822]  That was their opportunity to clarify this once and for all.
[01:47:50.382 --> 01:47:56.605]  So now we know they are absolutely culpable for what happened there.
[01:47:56.625 --> 01:47:57.266]  They're covering up.
[01:47:57.646 --> 01:47:59.467]  There are 84 other surveillance videos.
[01:47:59.607 --> 01:48:06.650]  Why didn't they take that opportunity to put everything to rest here if they indeed have- Well listen, let me just stop you.
[01:48:06.711 --> 01:48:07.531]  Listen, I agree with you.
[01:48:08.728 --> 01:48:16.932]  But we have to understand, they may have been bringing that out to make it look ridiculous, to even heighten the debate even further, to make that the central debate.
[01:48:17.053 --> 01:48:23.176]  That's my concern here, and I really see a lot of evidence that my analysis is going to shape up to be correct there.
[01:48:24.016 --> 01:48:34.922]  But it'd be like if I said I had a picture of a Bigfoot in my backyard, and I hyped it up for a week, and then when I released the photo, it was a picture of a brown smudge.
[01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:36.342]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:36.563 --> 01:48:37.303]  Finish up, George.
[01:48:37.683 --> 01:48:45.832]  Now, one other thing I wanted to mention is that I listened to your program last week with that guy that tried to say that Building 7 went from the top down.
[01:48:45.912 --> 01:48:47.374]  He's got to be blind.
[01:48:48.035 --> 01:48:54.162]  That went down like the most perfect controlled demolition I've ever seen, and I watched them all on this computer.
[01:48:55.029 --> 01:48:57.910]  It was beautiful, it went straight down, just evenly.
[01:48:58.150 --> 01:49:00.231]  Yeah, bottom down, the others went top down.
[01:49:00.391 --> 01:49:00.611]  Right.
[01:49:01.272 --> 01:49:08.755]  I know, well listen, they had to retract, Worldwide Daily had to retract that hit piece they let that lawyer write, who's tied in with the Bush administration.
[01:49:09.035 --> 01:49:11.176]  They had to retract that because he just made up a lie.
[01:49:13.737 --> 01:49:14.258]  We're good to go.
[01:49:32.219 --> 01:49:34.300]  Dog poo and tell us it's chocolate ice cream.
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:37.703]  I mean, it just, I'm sorry to use that analogy, but it isn't working anymore.
[01:49:38.223 --> 01:49:40.845]  It just is not, it is not chocolate ice cream, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:41.345 --> 01:49:42.266]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[01:49:42.586 --> 01:49:46.628]  Come back and talk to Omar and others on the other side with our guest, Les Jamison.
[01:49:46.689 --> 01:49:47.169]  Stay with us.
[01:49:57.268 --> 01:49:57.748]  It's here!
[01:49:57.968 --> 01:50:02.730]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:03.090 --> 01:50:10.752]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.432 --> 01:50:18.494]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.894 --> 01:50:25.776]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:26.266 --> 01:50:30.347]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.627 --> 01:50:34.108]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.588 --> 01:50:36.489]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.849 --> 01:50:40.750]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:57.924]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:50:57.964 --> 01:50:58.464]  are located?

[01:51:55.402 --> 01:51:55.783]  Thank you.
[01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:11.284]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.146 --> 01:52:43.247]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.407 --> 01:52:49.370]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.772 --> 01:53:09.018]  The big British rock band climbing up the charts, Muse, has now made the Sunday Mail, big newspaper, concerning 9-11 being an inside job, and they've thrown down the gauntlet.
[01:53:09.708 --> 01:53:16.271]  Yes, this is Brother General Omar Sousa, Dean of the Black Panther Militia.
[01:53:37.128 --> 01:53:55.651]  I think that we need to assimilate into self-lit, self-leaders, and demand treason trials for everybody that participated, from the puppet masters to everybody in the boot-licking Bush administration, and have real justice done.
[01:53:57.552 --> 01:54:01.492]  Well, sir, what do you think about the massive awakening that's happening right now?
[01:54:01.532 --> 01:54:04.253]  Have you ever seen such an energizing of the population?
[01:54:05.543 --> 01:54:06.723]  Doing a great job.
[01:54:06.883 --> 01:54:11.745]  You and all the valiant other patriots that love this country.
[01:54:12.185 --> 01:54:13.686]  Keep the momentum going.
[01:54:13.766 --> 01:54:16.046]  Demand treason trials now.
[01:54:17.447 --> 01:54:18.427]  How does that grab you?
[01:54:18.847 --> 01:54:19.708]  No, I agree.
[01:54:19.748 --> 01:54:20.468]  That's what we need.
[01:54:22.469 --> 01:54:24.109]  That's what we should be about doing.
[01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:25.169]  We got them going.
[01:54:25.209 --> 01:54:26.750]  We've got the truth behind us.
[01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:28.591]  And God is on our side.
[01:54:29.211 --> 01:54:32.712]  And we've got to warn everybody that when the next big terror attack comes, which I see...
[01:54:33.763 --> 01:54:34.343]  Exactly.
[01:54:34.624 --> 01:54:35.504]  I see it as imminent.
[01:54:35.524 --> 01:54:36.485]  What do you think, Omar?
[01:54:36.965 --> 01:54:38.867]  All terrorism is state-sponsored.
[01:54:39.147 --> 01:54:39.627]  It's them.
[01:54:40.848 --> 01:54:41.789]  We know it's them.
[01:54:42.349 --> 01:54:44.771]  Hey, let's demand these treason trials.
[01:54:45.491 --> 01:54:49.194]  And let's get them up out of there and restore our country to the way it should be.
[01:54:50.355 --> 01:54:51.616]  One nation, under God.
[01:54:53.197 --> 01:54:53.957]  I agree with you, sir.
[01:54:53.998 --> 01:54:55.799]  Anything else you'd like to add to Les Jamieson?
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.222]  God bless you and all you people for your efforts.
[01:55:01.077 --> 01:55:02.619]  All right, good to hear from you.
[01:55:02.639 --> 01:55:03.559]  Comments on that, Les?
[01:55:05.361 --> 01:55:05.901]  Yes.
[01:55:07.122 --> 01:55:29.200]  You know, I've been to several events here in New York with people like John Conyers, John Dean, you know, people who have experience inside government who are looking for ways to... John Conyers attempted to pass legislation to investigate for the lies of Iraq and so on and so forth.
[01:55:30.763 --> 01:55:39.932]  It's a very tricky situation to understand the political process within Congress to actually carry out impeachment proceedings.
[01:55:40.753 --> 01:55:45.478]  And, by the way, in order to indict a standing president... You have to first remove them.
[01:55:46.159 --> 01:55:47.700]  Right, they first have to be impeached.
[01:55:48.401 --> 01:55:53.006]  And what's, to me, just atrocious is that
[01:55:54.164 --> 01:56:09.515]  That in order to carry out these proceedings for impeachment, the Democrats would have to have a majority in Congress, meaning that the people within the red states, the Republicans... That's why the neocons can't let them win coming up.
[01:56:09.576 --> 01:56:10.816]  Let's take a final call here.
[01:56:11.417 --> 01:56:13.078]  Let's talk to Ken in Arizona.
[01:56:13.118 --> 01:56:13.779]  Ken, go ahead.
[01:56:14.579 --> 01:56:14.819]  Hi.
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:15.720]  Hi, how are you?
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:16.140]  Good.
[01:56:17.301 --> 01:56:19.883]  Okay, I have a couple quick things I want to ask you.
[01:56:20.123 --> 01:56:20.784]  Real fast.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:25.461]  Okay, the first thing is I'm trying to get a local access show here.
[01:56:25.961 --> 01:56:28.922]  I'm wondering if there's any issue with me showing some of your films?
[01:56:29.002 --> 01:56:30.422]  No, everybody's authorized to air them.
[01:56:30.982 --> 01:56:31.642]  Great, thank you.
[01:56:32.602 --> 01:56:43.184]  Also, can you quickly touch on, because there was a program on last night about 9-11, can you quickly touch on some of the cell phone calls and other calls that were made and what information that we know for sure about that?
[01:56:43.224 --> 01:56:48.045]  Well, some of them were air phone calls, okay, but some of the others were normal cell phone calls from above 8,000 feet.
[01:56:48.305 --> 01:56:51.026]  It's totally impossible unless it's been well documented.
[01:56:51.747 --> 01:56:52.548]  Right, I know.
[01:56:52.728 --> 01:57:03.036]  So my question is, they were talking about that on the show last night, saying certain people called, and I know there was some documentation that showed that some of the calls seemed very odd.
[01:57:03.617 --> 01:57:07.080]  Well, yeah, they'd say, hey, this is my name, don't you believe me, mommy, it's me.
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:09.762]  And another would say it was like it was a one-way conversation.
[01:57:09.782 --> 01:57:16.187]  Then the airphone calls are like stewardesses going, ah, there's something in the cockpit, ah, I can't breathe, which fits in with the gas.
[01:57:16.468 --> 01:57:20.391]  Listen, Les Jamieson, I'll see you in New York, and I appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:22.031]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:57:22.071 --> 01:57:23.914]  Keep up the great work and we're going to have an awesome weekend.
[01:57:24.134 --> 01:57:24.574]  You bet.
[01:57:24.594 --> 01:57:27.478]  We've got links up to your site and the organization and the itinerary.
[01:57:28.018 --> 01:57:29.320]  The program right there for folks.
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:29.961]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:34.025 --> 01:57:38.611]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.331 --> 01:57:50.972]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.632 --> 01:57:52.693]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.413 --> 01:57:54.494]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.174 --> 01:57:55.975]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.735 --> 01:57:57.616]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.636 --> 01:58:01.998]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.479 --> 01:58:06.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.283 --> 01:58:12.225]  Alright, Pat Buchanan is scheduled to be calling in in the next few minutes.
[01:58:12.405 --> 01:58:17.368]  Last time I had him on, about three years ago, I brought up Bohemian Grove to him, which he said he'd attended.
[01:58:18.055 --> 01:58:22.026]  When I pointed out that I'd been inside and seen the rituals, he suddenly said, Oh, I mean, that's a mistake.
[01:58:22.066 --> 01:58:23.449]  I didn't attend with Richard Nixon.
[01:58:23.469 --> 01:58:26.999]  Though we have photos of Nixon being there and he gave speeches there.
[01:58:27.623 --> 01:58:29.825]  And so, his new book's out, State of Emergency.
[01:58:29.865 --> 01:58:31.586]  I don't have him on to attack him today.
[01:58:32.107 --> 01:58:34.109]  I wasn't attacking him when we had him on a couple years ago.
[01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:35.610]  He's been on many times over the years.
[01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:38.652]  But we'll see if Buchanan shows up for the show.
[01:58:38.672 --> 01:58:40.094]  I know he's a very busy man.
[01:58:40.114 --> 01:58:45.058]  He's in Fox News Studios right now and is scheduled to be calling in here in the next few minutes.
[01:58:45.098 --> 01:58:49.141]  His new book, already number one on the New York Times best-selling list, State of Emergency.
[01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:55.847]  Now, we have talked about the very popular rock band, Muse.
[01:58:56.934 --> 01:59:05.037]  That over the weekend was on BBC Television Live wearing a t-shirt, the lead singer that said, Terror Storm.
[01:59:05.858 --> 01:59:17.283]  And when he was questioned about it by the media, he said, just go to Google Video and type in Terror Storm for a real surprise and some vital information.
[01:59:17.323 --> 01:59:23.145]  He has since been interviewed by a major newspaper on the subject.
[01:59:23.897 --> 01:59:28.362]  And is saying that he does believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:59:28.382 --> 01:59:32.908]  So let me just read to you some of this out of the Sunday Mail in the United Kingdom.
[01:59:33.268 --> 01:59:34.509]  This came out yesterday.
[01:59:41.452 --> 01:59:43.693]  Outspoken views on George Bush.
[01:59:43.973 --> 01:59:46.453]  Matt Bellamy's outspoken views on George Bush.
[01:59:46.894 --> 01:59:54.436]  The fiery British trio have rocketed to number nine on the US Billboard charts with their great new album, Black Holes and Revelations.
[01:59:55.076 --> 02:00:04.978]  But Matt, whose passion for conspiracy theories has inspired their songs, has fired a broadside at Wiley O. W. in the White House.
[02:00:05.018 --> 02:00:06.999]  He said, I'm fascinated by conspiracy theories.
[02:00:07.319 --> 02:00:08.699]  We're surrounded by them.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:10.460]  Boy, you're right about that.
[02:00:12.392 --> 02:00:15.014]  We're surrounded by criminal government conspiracy theories.
[02:00:15.594 --> 02:00:24.081]  Are we really supposed to believe that a man in a cave in Afghanistan managed to orchestrate the most unbelievable attack on the United States of all time?
[02:00:24.838 --> 02:00:32.722]  I think 9-11 was definitely an inside job done by a group of high-powered people looking for an excuse to invade the Middle East for oil and other natural resources.
[02:00:32.762 --> 02:00:36.323]  I think America needed another Pearl Harbor type event in order to invade Iraq.
[02:00:36.583 --> 02:00:37.183]  It gave the U.S.
[02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:37.484]  and U.K.
[02:00:37.504 --> 02:00:39.585]  governments the perfect excuse to go to war.
[02:00:40.065 --> 02:00:54.131]  I caught up with the singer when Muse and their other groups in the band, the printer screwed up and did lines across this, played a sellout gig at the Meadowbank Stadium
[02:00:55.250 --> 02:00:58.612]  In Edinburgh last week as part of Tea on the Fringe.
[02:00:59.092 --> 02:01:05.374]  Now the group are coming back north of the border to play the SECC in Glasgow on November 7th.
[02:01:05.414 --> 02:01:12.337]  On September 4th, the new single Straight Light is released as the follow-up to their smash hit Supermassive Black Hole.
[02:01:12.817 --> 02:01:19.700]  Muse filmed the straight video on a cargo ship off the coast of Los Angeles as it provided a stomach-churning experience.
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:22.241]  And it goes on.
[02:01:23.157 --> 02:01:30.882]  To just talk about how the band's winning all these awards, but right there in the middle of the story, saying they believe it is an inside job.
[02:01:32.043 --> 02:01:34.305]  We are working on getting in contact with these guys.
[02:01:34.345 --> 02:01:40.129]  We were contacted by another big British band over the weekend, but we've been out of town, so we're trying to get them on as well.
[02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:47.234]  This is highly exciting to see so many people beginning to witness
[02:01:47.933 --> 02:01:56.578]  Not just 9-11, but the lies of the Iraq War, the police state, the American Union, all the loss of freedoms that we're witnessing in this nation.
[02:01:57.539 --> 02:02:00.620]  And we are going to continue to stand up for this Republic.
[02:02:01.461 --> 02:02:15.149]  The things that elements of the government, these globalists, are doing are so criminal, so outlandish, so out in the open, they should all be removed from office right now for signing the American Union Pact in March of last year and then expanding it in December.
[02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:16.870]  It's real.
[02:02:17.711 --> 02:02:21.093]  It's happening and it must be exposed.
[02:02:21.454 --> 02:02:23.035]  You as listeners know all about it.
[02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:25.336]  But your friends, your family, your neighbors may not.
[02:02:25.836 --> 02:02:26.937]  Ring the alarm bells.
[02:02:27.597 --> 02:02:28.558]  Give them the evidence.
[02:02:29.198 --> 02:02:30.719]  Let them know what we're facing.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:33.901]  Or we can just decide to let America go under the waves.
[02:02:34.422 --> 02:02:35.623]  The United States disappear.
[02:02:37.124 --> 02:02:38.404]  We're on our last legs right now.
[02:02:38.745 --> 02:02:40.246]  People are rallying to defend the country.
[02:02:40.266 --> 02:02:40.926]  That's the good news.
[02:02:41.206 --> 02:02:41.747]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.528 --> 02:02:49.390]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:52.632]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:02:52.852 --> 02:02:59.036]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:02:59.436 --> 02:03:06.741]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:03:06.921 --> 02:03:11.004]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:03:11.284 --> 02:03:16.827]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[02:03:17.027 --> 02:03:30.133]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[02:03:30.333 --> 02:03:34.155]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Fruit and Places U.S.A.
[02:03:34.355 --> 02:03:38.877]  now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at
[02:03:39.777 --> 02:03:42.359]  It's here!
[02:03:42.419 --> 02:03:54.568]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.928 --> 02:04:02.554]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:03.274 --> 02:04:10.296]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.716 --> 02:04:22.139]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:22.439 --> 02:04:25.960]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:28.341]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.681 --> 02:04:32.502]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.413 --> 02:04:48.915]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:49.015 --> 02:04:51.377]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:04:51.437 --> 02:04:58.542]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote unquote.
[02:04:59.122 --> 02:05:01.304]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:05.582]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:06.143 --> 02:05:10.266]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:10.846 --> 02:05:13.828]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:14.809 --> 02:05:17.751]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:18.471 --> 02:05:20.913]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:20.953 --> 02:05:22.994]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.369]  U.S.
[02:05:32.449 --> 02:05:35.310]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[02:05:36.331 --> 02:05:44.194]  Call 888-XANADU, that's 888-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[02:05:46.835 --> 02:05:52.398]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:06.041 --> 02:06:28.369]  90% of the American people in a Gallup poll held during the George Bush financed illegal alien rampages of a few months ago, 90% it went from 87% in polls wanting to control the borders to 90% it backfired all those Mexican flags and then the neocons and the liberals tried to have their PR firms Rob Allen and co.
[02:06:28.389 --> 02:06:28.849]  serve out
[02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:33.195]  The American flags, but the people know they're being lied to.
[02:06:33.215 --> 02:06:33.195]  90%!
[02:06:35.018 --> 02:06:42.389]  And that's echoed by the excellent book I've now had a chance to read part of it over the weekend, State of Emergency, that I got on Friday.
[02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:44.673]  Already number one on the New York Times.
[02:06:44.933 --> 02:06:45.573]  Best seller list.
[02:06:45.593 --> 02:06:47.354]  You've got to get a copy of this.
[02:06:47.414 --> 02:06:57.916]  I've seen no chronicle, I've read about half of it, that lays out, page by page, bombshell after bombshell, all documented, because as you know, I'm an expert on this subject, as many of you are.
[02:06:57.996 --> 02:06:58.916]  We cover this.
[02:06:58.956 --> 02:07:00.437]  We believe this is the number one issue.
[02:07:00.737 --> 02:07:03.657]  It dwarfs the quote, threat of international terrorism.
[02:07:03.977 --> 02:07:06.398]  The globalists have signed the North American Union pact.
[02:07:06.798 --> 02:07:13.721]  We are going into it, and joining us from the Fox News studios, a very busy man, is Patrick Buchanan.
[02:07:13.781 --> 02:07:17.323]  Patrick J. Buchanan with a new book, State of Emergency.
[02:07:17.343 --> 02:07:23.125]  He, of course, a few years ago wrote The Death of the West, and we may already be dead, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:23.645 --> 02:07:25.106]  Pat Buchanan, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:07:25.366 --> 02:07:27.087]  Well, thank you very much, Alex, for having me.
[02:07:27.893 --> 02:07:41.482]  Tell us, sir, why you decided to write a second book on this subject, and break down the new developments that have happened, and explain to us how this is the state of emergency, the third world war, the third world invasion, and the conquest of America.
[02:07:42.303 --> 02:07:56.953]  Well, I looked at the situation, and it came up, and we were engaged in this battle ever since last December, and all the way up through this year, and it seemed to me, looking at it, looking at the numbers, looking at what's going to happen if we don't get control of the border,
[02:07:57.472 --> 02:08:04.698]  And if there is a Bush amnesty or a McCain-Kennedy amnesty, I think that we're looking at how America ends.
[02:08:05.278 --> 02:08:24.553]  You take a look at civilizations and empires, and I've studied them, and how they end invariably is when the population ceases to reproduce itself, as native-born Americans are doing, inevitably the great nations are invaded peacefully from foreign lands, and then you have the decomposition, the breakup,
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.362]  The breakup of the body, if you will, when the soul, which is patriotism, dies.
[02:08:30.062 --> 02:08:52.491]  And as you look at what is happening to America, the incapacity of our leaders even to control the borders, even to control the doors to our own national home, and the magnitude of the invasion, 36 million immigrants here, more than almost as many as all that ever came in our history, and 12 million of them illegally, 6 million tried to get in and Bush's watch,
[02:08:53.021 --> 02:08:58.023]  The Mexican government looking upon the United States as a dumping ground for its poor and unemployed.
[02:08:58.643 --> 02:09:01.784]  A tripling of the third world people not from Mexico.
[02:09:01.804 --> 02:09:05.206]  A tripling in three years of those caught at the border.
[02:09:05.906 --> 02:09:08.187]  These being turned, released, and let go.
[02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:21.612]  I don't see how, Alex, you stop the invasion if we do not stop it cold now with a security fence, no amnesty, and start punishing businesses that hire illegals and cut off all welfare benefits.
[02:09:22.717 --> 02:09:24.177]  Well, you're absolutely right, sir.
[02:09:24.998 --> 02:09:26.998]  There's so many facets I want to go over here.
[02:09:27.038 --> 02:09:38.602]  You mentioned, and you've got the statistics in your book, that we now have in this country as many current immigrants as we had in the 200-plus years before that.
[02:09:38.842 --> 02:09:42.943]  And if they were coming here wanting to join the United States, that'd be one thing.
[02:09:43.403 --> 02:09:47.024]  Most of them are vehemently saying they want to bring down the United States.
[02:09:47.304 --> 02:09:48.825]  They want to reconquista.
[02:09:49.165 --> 02:09:52.086]  I was listening to NPR coming back from Dallas.
[02:09:52.466 --> 02:09:53.646]  Well, a lot of them welcome what's happening.
[02:09:53.666 --> 02:09:54.806]  They are really anti-Western culture.
[02:09:54.846 --> 02:09:55.907]  They are in many ways anti-
[02:10:19.981 --> 02:10:21.542]  And there's a hostility.
[02:10:21.562 --> 02:10:28.587]  Remember Susan Sontag made her famous statement, the leftist intellectual, the white race is the cancer of human history.
[02:10:29.127 --> 02:10:37.933]  Many are rejoicing in the fact that the America that we loved and grew up in and we inherited from our parents, that this is disappearing.
[02:10:38.093 --> 02:10:39.434]  It is being inundated.
[02:10:39.754 --> 02:10:41.555]  The culture is being inundated.
[02:10:41.635 --> 02:10:43.156]  It's being split apart.
[02:10:43.732 --> 02:10:47.774]  All of these things people are welcoming under the name of multiculturalism.
[02:10:48.274 --> 02:10:53.796]  But when the culture dies, the unifying culture of a country, the country itself dies, Alex.
[02:10:54.317 --> 02:11:07.122]  Well, Ray Nagin got criticized when he just said, listen, you know, this city's culture is a chocolate city, and we don't like the fact that the majority is not going to be foreigners or openly say this is Mexico.
[02:11:07.382 --> 02:11:08.863]  Ray Nagin's absolutely right!
[02:11:09.203 --> 02:11:10.824]  Well, look, black people are
[02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:14.199]  Are as American as apple pie.
[02:11:14.319 --> 02:11:16.140]  I grew up in Washington, D.C.
[02:11:16.661 --> 02:11:18.802]  It was a segregated city, a southern city.
[02:11:19.443 --> 02:11:26.268]  But at the same time, African-Americans or black Americans and white Americans, we were marinated in the same culture.
[02:11:26.328 --> 02:11:28.150]  We had the same teams we rooted for.
[02:11:28.210 --> 02:11:32.453]  We watched the same TV shows, listened to the same radio, went to the same movies.
[02:11:32.933 --> 02:11:40.039]  When we went to schools, the schools may have been segregated, public schools, but we studied the same literature, studied the same language.
[02:11:40.529 --> 02:11:43.551]  The same history, the same heroes, the same holidays.
[02:11:44.011 --> 02:11:45.132]  We were one people.
[02:11:45.252 --> 02:11:49.774]  If you had called a black American in those days, they were called Negroes.
[02:11:49.814 --> 02:11:53.016]  If you called them an African then, you'd have been punched in your face.
[02:11:53.726 --> 02:11:55.206]  And so we were one people.
[02:11:55.647 --> 02:12:02.048]  But what's happening now when you got, you know, half of Los Angeles County doesn't even speak English in its own home?
[02:12:02.668 --> 02:12:03.709]  We're Balkanizing.
[02:12:04.109 --> 02:12:07.870]  We're breaking up culturally, linguistically, and socially.
[02:12:08.110 --> 02:12:12.291]  I remember eight years ago, a ten-part series in the San Antonio Express News
[02:12:12.991 --> 02:12:14.032]  Well, that is a huge, huge part of it.
[02:12:14.052 --> 02:12:16.794]  You know, many of these huge corporations that used to be
[02:12:42.970 --> 02:12:50.973]  Really proud American corporations that built the weapons that won World War II, now all declare themselves global corporations.
[02:12:51.473 --> 02:13:02.276]  And their ambition is to remove all national barriers and frontiers, so they can move people and goods wherever they want to, which they feel is most efficient for the company.
[02:13:02.656 --> 02:13:07.158]  So they put the company ahead of the country, and they genuinely believe
[02:13:08.154 --> 02:13:15.836]  What we need is a global market where these big corporations can move all over the global market, and there's a global government there that runs it all.
[02:13:15.896 --> 02:13:17.677]  This is the New World Order idea.
[02:13:18.317 --> 02:13:24.359]  And frankly, there is a program, and I write about it in a column for tomorrow morning, Alex, but it's also in the book.
[02:13:24.999 --> 02:13:27.299]  It's the North American Union concept.
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:30.400]  Vicente Fox has signed on.
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:37.002]  The foreign minister of Mexico talks about complete economic integration, or complete integration of the two countries.
[02:13:37.628 --> 02:13:42.249]  The Council on Foreign Relations is talking about the erasure of the borders.
[02:13:42.289 --> 02:13:51.852]  He said the way to solve the illegal airline problem is let them all come in, erase the border, and have Canada, the United States, and Mexico be one union.
[02:13:52.452 --> 02:13:57.613]  In other words, like the European Union, and that is to merge with the European Union eventually
[02:13:58.237 --> 02:14:00.238]  Into the, if you will, the New World World.
[02:14:00.538 --> 02:14:15.446]  Pat, how do we in the past, you talking about this decades ago, myself for over a decade, we may be called conspiracy theorists, but David Rockefeller published his memoirs two years ago and said, I've been accused of wanting one world government and getting rid of the U.S., well I stand guilty as accused, that's exactly what I want.
[02:14:15.687 --> 02:14:16.527]  These people are country.
[02:14:17.007 --> 02:14:19.068]  They are out of the closet, that's exactly right.
[02:14:19.128 --> 02:14:21.930]  Walter Cronkite said virtually the same thing.
[02:14:22.581 --> 02:14:39.010]  And folks say that, look, America, what we're going to have to do, we're going to have to strengthen and empower the UN, we're all going to have to surrender some of our sovereignty, we're going to have to have these global institutions, prevent wars by putting down, by being supreme over nations and countries.
[02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:44.433]  What that is, Alex, is an act of wholesale treason.
[02:14:45.336 --> 02:14:50.444]  Against what the founding fathers believed and what they fought for and what many of them died for.
[02:14:50.604 --> 02:15:01.100]  Pat, we know, and all the veterans died for, we know that the Democrats are for this, but the Republicans seem to be leading this even though it's going to lose them control of the House and maybe even
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:04.522]  The Senate, or the Senate, maybe even the House.
[02:15:04.902 --> 02:15:30.076]  I mean, we're seeing this unfold, and George Bush continues to try to spin it with double-speak, saying, oh no, my guest worker program is an amnesty, but you read the plan, as you mentioned, the Kennedy plan that Bush has been supporting, it's blanket, total amnesty, and in the SPP.gov agreement signed last March in Waco, Texas, it says that we're going to have an American ID card in North America, and all the Mexicans and Canadians will instantly be legalized.
[02:15:30.692 --> 02:15:37.798]  Well, that's the instrument by which the nations are welded together is the NAFTA superhighway.
[02:15:38.398 --> 02:15:44.583]  Coming up from Lazaro Cardenas port all the way up through the United States into Canada.
[02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:51.308]  And people don't, they bring the containers in from China and they bring them to a customs port, if you can believe it, in Kansas City.
[02:15:51.328 --> 02:15:56.612]  How are Americans going to like the Mexican government running a large portion of that city?
[02:15:57.543 --> 02:16:05.088]  Well, I think the American people are up in arms, but we cannot get any response from the government of the United States.
[02:16:05.108 --> 02:16:05.669]  That's the thing.
[02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:17.977]  97% of Texans that even just have a small glimpse of what the Trans-Texas Corridor is, the first leg of the NAFTA highways, 97% of the Houston Chronicle poll are against it, 90% are against open borders,
[02:16:18.938 --> 02:16:22.401]  70% are against the Iraq War, but they don't care!
[02:16:22.421 --> 02:16:25.083]  The establishment just keeps moving forward, Pat!
[02:16:25.223 --> 02:16:29.146]  How do we demand the constitutional will of the people?
[02:16:29.767 --> 02:16:36.433]  You know, the Constitution says, and it's explicit, that the government of the United States shall protect the states from invasion.
[02:16:37.033 --> 02:16:44.560]  Now, if 12 million people here illegally, three times the size of the American army in Europe after World War II,
[02:16:45.487 --> 02:16:51.990]  If that is not an invasion, and six million trying to break in on Bush's watch is not an invasion, I don't know what it is.
[02:16:52.210 --> 02:16:53.570]  But they refuse to do it.
[02:16:53.830 --> 02:17:02.614]  The President himself has said, look, I can't defend the borders unless you give me, basically, my guest worker program and my amnesty program.
[02:17:02.934 --> 02:17:04.094]  And then you won't need to.
[02:17:04.414 --> 02:17:05.975]  I won't defend the borders.
[02:17:06.595 --> 02:17:08.756]  Then you won't need to because there won't be a border.
[02:17:09.116 --> 02:17:09.757]  There's not going to be.
[02:17:09.817 --> 02:17:10.377]  Exactly.
[02:17:10.817 --> 02:17:13.318]  If you do not get the border under control now,
[02:17:13.979 --> 02:17:17.622]  Then the agenda of these people will be realized by default.
[02:17:19.483 --> 02:17:24.827]  They know what they're doing, and Pat, I hear some of the mainline conservative talk show hosts up there spinning it.
[02:17:25.087 --> 02:17:34.013]  They'll talk about the border problem, but then they won't go all the way and explain that it's headed up by George W. Neocon, more liberal than Bill Clinton Bush.
[02:17:34.634 --> 02:17:38.677]  Pat Buchanan, the new book, State of Emergency, with us on the other side.
[02:17:38.697 --> 02:17:39.237]  Stay with us.
[02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:45.291]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:17:45.311 --> 02:17:45.831]  are located?
[02:17:46.031 --> 02:17:49.412]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:17:49.632 --> 02:17:54.354]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:17:54.634 --> 02:17:59.615]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:17:59.935 --> 02:18:00.255]  I think so.
[02:18:19.309 --> 02:18:19.589]  I think so.
[02:18:41.135 --> 02:18:47.342]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:47.802 --> 02:18:55.590]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:55.931 --> 02:19:03.779]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:04.099 --> 02:19:08.841]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:09.181 --> 02:19:13.862]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:14.402 --> 02:19:18.264]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:19:18.744 --> 02:19:19.764]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:19.824 --> 02:19:23.925]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:19:24.346 --> 02:19:28.727]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:19:29.247 --> 02:19:31.748]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:19:32.228 --> 02:19:34.809]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.130 --> 02:19:37.611]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.731 --> 02:19:42.734]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:42.854 --> 02:19:53.319]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[02:19:53.399 --> 02:19:58.542]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[02:19:59.322 --> 02:20:03.804]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns, guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[02:20:04.484 --> 02:20:10.186]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[02:20:10.946 --> 02:20:18.949]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:26.992 --> 02:20:30.794]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:31.574 --> 02:20:32.955]  Call now.
[02:20:33.095 --> 02:20:39.457]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:42.298 --> 02:20:45.120]  Have you been noticing that something is different in the world today?
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:49.341]  Nostradamus said that at the turn of the last century, things would reverse.
[02:20:49.761 --> 02:20:52.423]  That good would become bad and bad would become good.
[02:20:52.903 --> 02:20:55.924]  That there would be a crossover and we would enter the apocalypse.
[02:20:56.488 --> 02:20:58.609]  You cannot deny that his words have come to pass.
[02:20:59.289 --> 02:21:00.370]  What does this mean for us?
[02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:05.252]  Jerry Vano has written a book entitled The Uncovering of the Greatest Story Never Told.
[02:21:05.732 --> 02:21:15.136]  He explains mysteries that have been kept from the masses by the ruling powers about our origin and purpose for being and about the apocalyptic time we live in and the result in the year 2012.
[02:21:15.436 --> 02:21:20.459]  You can get the book on the internet at Amazon.com or Barnes and Noble.
[02:21:20.919 --> 02:21:23.440]  It can be bought in paperback, e-book and talking book.
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:25.961]  The Uncovering of the Greatest Story Never Told.
[02:21:26.482 --> 02:21:31.346]  Visit Jerry Vano's homepage at www.gvano.com.
[02:21:32.427 --> 02:21:34.369]  Again, that's www.gvano.com.
[02:21:52.168 --> 02:22:02.754]  We're talking to Pat Buchanan right now.
[02:22:03.855 --> 02:22:08.777]  Pat, again, you know, I am a paleo-conservative.
[02:22:08.817 --> 02:22:15.161]  I don't want to even be associated with George Bush and his gaggle that are basically destroying this country right now.
[02:22:16.921 --> 02:22:23.028]  I know a lot of Americans have woken up now to how bad the immigration problem is and how serious it is to our sovereignty.
[02:22:23.609 --> 02:22:28.694]  But I'm always amazed to then discover, it was even in the Dallas Morning News, it was actually Rob Allen and Co.
[02:22:29.055 --> 02:22:34.141]  that Bush hired to go in and help Fox stage those illegal alien demonstrations.
[02:22:34.181 --> 02:22:35.863]  So we directly have our government
[02:22:36.443 --> 02:22:45.325]  Manipulating and fomenting and trying to use illegal aliens as a foreign group domestically in our country to manipulate our policies.
[02:22:45.385 --> 02:22:49.245]  I mean, that is espionage right there, Pat.
[02:22:49.885 --> 02:22:51.746]  I think the regime is betraying the people.
[02:22:51.946 --> 02:22:53.586]  The regime is betraying the nation.
[02:22:54.586 --> 02:22:57.567]  The American people want their country protected.
[02:22:57.587 --> 02:22:58.967]  They want their borders defended.
[02:22:59.667 --> 02:23:05.528]  And I think the American regime in Washington, both parties, is very much in collusion with Mr. Fox
[02:23:06.377 --> 02:23:08.698]  And very much sympathetic with his agenda.
[02:23:09.118 --> 02:23:10.098]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:23:10.178 --> 02:23:26.543]  I think the only reason the President and the White House are moving along and offering sort of some border fence and the rest of it is because the American people and the people of the American Southwest, from Texas all the way to California, have risen up and demanded this happen.
[02:23:26.943 --> 02:23:32.525]  They're using this crisis, giving a little bit in that area to resolve that, they say,
[02:23:33.146 --> 02:24:00.565]  in order to get their amnesty and guest worker program for the transnational corporations i think that is the bottom line and frankly i believe the senator hutchinson and uh... and mike pence are working on a plan which i think the administration the washington post and others are behind which is basically to say well we're going to have border security but we're also going to have a path to citizenship no amnesty as you say you know misleading us all
[02:24:01.232 --> 02:24:04.257]  And I think if we follow that, that's the end of the United States as we know it.
[02:24:17.376 --> 02:24:21.979]  A few hundred guardsmen at any one time on the border, not even allowed to bust these illegals.
[02:24:21.999 --> 02:24:24.161]  They now issued a new order a month ago.
[02:24:24.761 --> 02:24:28.944]  Chertoff ordered the Border Patrol to not pursue illegals above the speed limit.
[02:24:29.224 --> 02:24:30.625]  They're busy tying their hands.
[02:24:30.665 --> 02:24:32.226]  I mean, it's smoke and mirrors.
[02:24:32.746 --> 02:24:33.447]  Well, it really is.
[02:24:33.527 --> 02:24:37.949]  And when you take a look at the numbers, the figures are astronomical.
[02:24:38.770 --> 02:24:43.513]  And the President of the United States, you know, can you imagine that in last year, in 2005, he admitted
[02:24:45.475 --> 02:24:51.558]  That of the OTMs, these other than Mexicans, I think we caught 150,000 of them on the border.
[02:24:51.578 --> 02:24:56.240]  They're from the Middle East, they're from Asia, China, and, you know, Africa.
[02:24:56.781 --> 02:24:58.682]  And everybody knows, nobody knows where.
[02:24:58.702 --> 02:25:05.065]  And they were released into our population, and he said, you know, only one in four turned up in court?
[02:25:06.552 --> 02:25:08.713]  What do you expect?
[02:25:08.753 --> 02:25:13.354]  The criminals who broke into our country, they're really going to turn up in court and get booted out!
[02:25:13.834 --> 02:25:14.734]  Well, that's right.
[02:25:14.834 --> 02:25:26.836]  Going back to the Houston Chronicle again, last year they reported that 250,000 in the two years before it was catch and release, that foreigners other than Latin Americans had been released.
[02:25:27.256 --> 02:25:30.777]  Sure, they turned them loose and Bush says, you know, we've got to change this, Pauli.
[02:25:30.817 --> 02:25:34.638]  Here we are, three years after the greatest terrorist act
[02:25:35.211 --> 02:25:46.882]  In America, and you got people coming in, not just from Mexico, but from other than Mexico, Middle Eastern countries, some of them countries are known as State Sponsors of Terror, and they're being released!
[02:25:47.323 --> 02:25:49.405]  How can you say the border is secure?
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:51.621]  Pat Buchanan, let's be specific though.
[02:25:51.641 --> 02:25:57.526]  I don't know if you saw the Dallas Morning News back in December, but they reported then that Rob Allen Co.
[02:25:57.566 --> 02:26:01.950]  had been hired to craft the policy with Fox, with the White House, to stage the demonstrations.
[02:26:02.270 --> 02:26:09.697]  Can you specifically speak to the White House being actively involved with a foreign mass to bully the American people?
[02:26:10.397 --> 02:26:17.783]  Well, I think this is, I mean, Fox and Bush have been colluding on this policy since before 9-11.
[02:26:19.093 --> 02:26:20.093]  There is no doubt about it.
[02:26:20.273 --> 02:26:26.335]  Vicente Fox was standing right beside Bush when Bush declared the Minutemen vigilantes.
[02:26:26.875 --> 02:26:28.496]  He is with Mr. Fox.
[02:26:28.856 --> 02:26:34.297]  Now, if you listen to Mr. Fox, though, he goes up to Chicago and he's speaking to Mexican-American citizens.
[02:26:34.357 --> 02:26:35.217]  These are Americans.
[02:26:35.918 --> 02:26:40.259]  And he says, basically, you are Mexicans who live north of the border.
[02:26:40.739 --> 02:26:44.160]  Our country extends outside of Mexico.
[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:44.760]  In other words,
[02:26:45.242 --> 02:26:47.944]  Mexicans in America are a part of Mexico.
[02:26:48.024 --> 02:26:49.926]  They're openly declaring war on us.
[02:26:50.206 --> 02:26:52.148]  They're openly declaring... Exactly.
[02:26:52.188 --> 02:26:53.489]  They're openly reaching for...
[02:26:53.959 --> 02:26:58.903]  To reclaim the allegiance of American citizens who have taken an oath of allegiance to the United States.
[02:26:59.323 --> 02:27:02.826]  They are pushing Mexican people into the United States.
[02:27:02.866 --> 02:27:04.247]  They are aiding and abetting them.
[02:27:04.567 --> 02:27:06.008]  They are calling them heroes.
[02:27:06.388 --> 02:27:10.271]  They have an agenda of dual citizenship, Mexicans and Americans.
[02:27:10.651 --> 02:27:13.113]  So they get influence and control over U.S.
[02:27:13.513 --> 02:27:14.414]  wealth and U.S.
[02:27:14.494 --> 02:27:15.375]  foreign policy.
[02:27:15.928 --> 02:27:22.290]  And the President of the United States is either oblivious to it, but in any event, he has done nothing at all about it.
[02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:25.271]  Well, Pat Buchanan, we'll come right back with another segment.
[02:27:25.711 --> 02:27:27.471]  I want to get into the CFR plan.
[02:27:27.511 --> 02:27:28.831]  We know who's pulling the strings.
[02:27:31.372 --> 02:27:32.272]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.773 --> 02:27:34.353]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.373 --> 02:27:37.974]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.430 --> 02:27:47.592]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:47.832 --> 02:27:49.592]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:49.872 --> 02:27:56.195]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:27:56.495 --> 02:28:02.677]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:02.917 --> 02:28:10.420]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:13.642]  Now available is the 2006 Biosolutions Plus.
[02:28:13.842 --> 02:28:17.905]  The Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:28:18.045 --> 02:28:21.608]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.

[02:29:53.423 --> 02:30:01.970]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[02:30:43.766 --> 02:30:49.810]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:50.411 --> 02:30:53.393]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.995 --> 02:30:59.477]  Pat Buchanan's been gracious enough to spend the rest of the hour with us.
[02:30:59.497 --> 02:31:06.282]  I may even try at the end of this long segment, take a few calls specifically on the LaRica on Keys to the Open Borders, the North American Union.
[02:31:06.322 --> 02:31:07.463]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:14.391]  And first-time callers, I'd like to hear from them as well.
[02:31:14.411 --> 02:31:15.192]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:16.252 --> 02:31:20.254]  I want to play just the first minute of a CNN clip from about two months ago.
[02:31:20.874 --> 02:31:28.157]  This is where Lou Dobbs, very credible, highly respected, is talking about the end of America.
[02:31:28.197 --> 02:31:28.878]  Play a clip of that.
[02:31:29.458 --> 02:31:38.742]  The Bush administration's open borders policy and its decision to ignore the enforcement of this country's immigration laws is part of a broader agenda.
[02:31:39.594 --> 02:31:43.681]  President Bush signed a formal agreement that will end the United States as we know it.
[02:31:44.422 --> 02:31:47.166]  And he took the step without approval from either the U.S.
[02:31:47.186 --> 02:31:49.850]  Congress or the people of the United States.
[02:31:50.752 --> 02:31:51.713]  Bill Tucker reports.
[02:31:54.775 --> 02:32:04.602]  So, there's Lou Dobbs stating what you're stating, because anybody who's read the SPP agreements, anybody who's seen this, this is the North American Union, this is globalism.
[02:32:05.122 --> 02:32:12.647]  I've got the CFR report they put out last year that was then written into this executive agreement that bypasses Congress.
[02:32:12.707 --> 02:32:15.209]  It's a treaty without, I guess, ratification.
[02:32:15.996 --> 02:32:17.378]  For this North American Union.
[02:32:18.159 --> 02:32:20.161]  Pat, let's talk about the people above this.
[02:32:20.201 --> 02:32:23.906]  The Council on Foreign Relations openly saying this is about global government.
[02:32:24.207 --> 02:32:26.389]  And then the Minions at the lower level.
[02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:27.270]  Why?
[02:32:27.551 --> 02:32:29.613]  And folks, the Larica and Keister crowd.
[02:32:29.754 --> 02:32:31.316]  I mean, they openly say
[02:32:31.736 --> 02:32:33.258]  That they want to kill all the whites.
[02:32:33.779 --> 02:32:41.228]  The big UT Chicano Studies professor up at UT Dallas, Arlington, openly says all whites must be killed.
[02:32:41.528 --> 02:32:42.549]  Plan of San Diego.
[02:32:42.609 --> 02:32:43.370]  I have him on tape.
[02:32:43.410 --> 02:32:44.411]  We can play it if we have time.
[02:32:44.431 --> 02:32:45.813]  We've played it many times here for you.
[02:32:45.833 --> 02:32:46.534]  It's on the website.
[02:32:46.814 --> 02:32:48.737]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:32:49.077 --> 02:32:49.538]  Imagine!
[02:32:50.038 --> 02:32:54.541]  And the number isn't 12 million folks, it's more like 30 million illegal aliens in this country right now.
[02:32:55.201 --> 02:33:00.364]  Groups openly saying they want to kill Americans, openly calling blacks Mayatas.
[02:33:00.784 --> 02:33:05.447]  They are the minority, as you said, Hispanic Americans who are very patriotic or upset about this.
[02:33:05.787 --> 02:33:08.028]  Fox chastises them and says, you're Mexicans.
[02:33:08.388 --> 02:33:17.594]  So let's talk about those above and then those below, this perfect storm that if we don't clamp down on it now and force this elite to stop, the country's gone.
[02:33:17.614 --> 02:33:18.074]  Pat Buchanan?
[02:33:18.394 --> 02:33:20.856]  Well, this is what I call the Aslan plot.
[02:33:21.256 --> 02:33:23.458]  It's got a number of themes at different levels.
[02:33:24.099 --> 02:33:37.649]  At the ultra-level, at the high-level, you've got Vicente Fox and his foreign ministers and others talking about a European Union, a merger, the complete integration of the two countries, a merger of the two countries, an erasure of the borders, a European Union.
[02:33:38.050 --> 02:33:45.736]  You've got the Council on Foreign Relations, Dr. Robert Pasteur, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a panel of that committee,
[02:33:47.091 --> 02:33:49.752]  The way to solve this problem of illegal immigration is simple.
[02:33:50.212 --> 02:33:53.672]  We erase the American border at the Rio Grande.
[02:33:53.712 --> 02:33:55.313]  We erase the border with Canada.
[02:33:55.873 --> 02:33:59.173]  We merge the three countries into a North American Union.
[02:33:59.654 --> 02:34:01.294]  We put the border at Guatemala.
[02:34:01.714 --> 02:34:07.075]  And so we get one North American Union all the way from Guatemala to Prudhoe Bay.
[02:34:07.695 --> 02:34:12.016]  And ultimately in this union, of course, you would have to have American
[02:34:12.481 --> 02:34:16.444]  transferring wealth to Mexico City and Mexicans giving free run to the United States.
[02:34:16.464 --> 02:34:26.790]  By the way, that's in the plan to use the toll road money to pay for building roads in Mexico so they can pump even more of the third world population that doubles every thirty five years.
[02:34:27.010 --> 02:34:28.451]  I mean, this is amazing.
[02:34:28.631 --> 02:34:34.755]  And they still have a continental security force made up of US, Mexicans and Canadians all the way around our border.
[02:34:35.095 --> 02:34:37.437]  So we're talking about foreign troops in America.
[02:34:37.797 --> 02:34:39.418]  Well, you're talking also about, look,
[02:34:40.938 --> 02:34:51.620]  46% of the people of Mexico say they would like to live here, so you would automatically get, I mean that's almost 50 million people, you would get a huge influx of tens of millions of Mexicans into the United States.
[02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:55.341]  In addition to that, 58% of all Mexicans believe the American Southwest belongs to them anyhow.
[02:34:55.361 --> 02:34:56.061]  28% say it's American, 14% don't know.
[02:34:56.081 --> 02:34:58.281]  75% of Mexicans now believe all Americans or white Americans are all
[02:35:09.255 --> 02:35:35.995]  Racist when they have when they have games soccer games in Mexico and the Mexican score they chant Osama Osama And you've got this that's at the one level you've got the very high thing working between Vicente Fox and Bush Council on foreign relations Kennedy McCain at that level, but there's a different level as well and you quoted that one individual in the burials you find the the the matchup is very very popular and
[02:35:36.448 --> 02:35:39.009]  among radical Mexican and Hispanic students.
[02:35:39.029 --> 02:35:43.130]  They talk about the bronze continent, the bronze culture, and the bronze people.
[02:35:43.170 --> 02:35:44.550]  This is our continent.
[02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:45.330]  It's not yours.
[02:35:45.370 --> 02:35:46.310]  You go back to Europe.
[02:35:46.811 --> 02:35:48.091]  It is extremely militant.
[02:35:48.131 --> 02:35:49.371]  La Voz de Aztlan.
[02:35:49.791 --> 02:35:51.972]  It is one of the, uh, it's the voice of La Mecha.
[02:35:52.352 --> 02:35:53.372]  It is anti-white.
[02:35:53.412 --> 02:35:54.492]  It is anti-Jewish.
[02:35:55.053 --> 02:36:04.695]  And it talks about, you know, this is the, this land from the, in the American Southwest is the original Aztlan from which the Aztecs came to take over Mexico, and we're taking it back.
[02:36:05.282 --> 02:36:13.268]  And then you've got the consuls and the intellectuals and the others who talk about the La Reconquista.
[02:36:13.568 --> 02:36:15.110]  We're reconquering the Southwest.
[02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.930]  It is peaceful.
[02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:20.554]  They talk about this magnificent project that's underway, the Reconquista.
[02:36:20.634 --> 02:36:24.817]  And the truth is, native-born Americans are leaving California.
[02:36:25.277 --> 02:36:30.341]  As the Hispanics and Chicanos pour in, native-born Californians are leaving.
[02:36:30.701 --> 02:36:32.122]  They're moving over the mountains.
[02:36:32.143 --> 02:36:33.964]  They're going to Idaho and Colorado.
[02:36:34.528 --> 02:36:42.073]  In Arizona, the white population not only declines as a share of the population, but in real terms, it is falling.
[02:36:42.133 --> 02:36:45.875]  For the first time since the Spanish came, they're leaving California.
[02:36:46.295 --> 02:36:58.543]  Now you can project these trends out to the middle of the century... But Pat, Pat, and I want to talk about those trends, and this is a key point you just brought up, but I want to go back and get that first statement commented on.
[02:36:59.338 --> 02:37:20.254]  I mean, I have a CD here with hundreds of clips of professors and top leaders saying, we are going to kill you, all whites must be killed, and the media covers this up and universities finance this, and then they also chortle and laugh and say the whites are all dying, ha ha ha.
[02:37:20.594 --> 02:37:26.899]  I've got that quote in my book, that they're not having babies, they're, you know, crapping in their pants and all this other stuff.
[02:37:27.321 --> 02:37:32.123]  You've got all this kind of talk you get in all these rants and things, most of them in my book.
[02:37:32.383 --> 02:37:36.685]  These are the people who, as I say, are the wild men of the barrios.
[02:37:37.265 --> 02:37:51.251]  And they're more and more militant and more and more hostile and more and more chauvinistic, if you will, for their culture and the Mestizo and the Amerindian populations.
[02:37:51.611 --> 02:37:53.452]  And it is very much a racial thing.
[02:37:55.037 --> 02:37:55.998]  Well, they tell you it is.
[02:37:56.038 --> 02:37:57.660]  I mean, it's like the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:37:57.700 --> 02:37:59.222]  I mean, it's the exact same thing.
[02:37:59.583 --> 02:38:09.015]  Exactly, only the Ku Klux Klan can't get out 500,000 or a million people to march in Los Angeles under foreign flags in a matter of days.
[02:38:10.413 --> 02:38:32.539]  Well, we have our government run by the globalists telling us, don't love the U.S., don't be patriotic, and at the same time, I was up in Canada during the World Cup, and there were Mexicans running around with huge flags in the streets, wild-eyed, screaming La Reconquista, and saying, I mean, I'm there covering Bilderberg Group, Pat, and there are people running past the Parliament with Mexican flags, saying Canada belongs to Mexico.
[02:38:35.457 --> 02:38:38.438]  I think even the Spanish didn't get that far up.
[02:38:39.439 --> 02:38:43.360]  The Canadians better wake up, I'll tell you that, Alex.
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:49.322]  They've got 25% of their population now, or close to that, is foreign born, which is even higher than the United States.
[02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:54.150]  The five-year census just came out.
[02:38:54.210 --> 02:38:57.871]  New York Times reported 60-plus percent of New York is foreign-born.
[02:38:58.231 --> 02:38:59.631]  Most of those are illegal aliens.
[02:39:00.031 --> 02:39:04.173]  Most major cities are over half illegal alien or foreigners.
[02:39:05.513 --> 02:39:12.635]  I wonder why the La Rica and Keystone Mexicans think Mexico is so good when they're one of the most corrupt, despotic systems anywhere.
[02:39:13.035 --> 02:39:18.096]  You know, you ought to say to them, look, you love the country so much you march under its flags.
[02:39:18.577 --> 02:39:19.917]  Go back to the country you love.
[02:39:20.635 --> 02:39:23.356]  I mean, if it's that great a country, why did you leave it and come here?
[02:39:23.376 --> 02:39:32.158]  In the truth, they know they've got a corrupt regime and a failed regime, and I will say, the Mexican people are hard-working people, and they've not been rewarded.
[02:39:32.198 --> 02:39:39.980]  They've been robbed again and again by their governments, which devalue their currency, in effect robbing the Mexican folks of their savings.
[02:39:40.339 --> 02:39:43.200]  They got an income down there about 15% of what we get.
[02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:52.241]  I understand why they're coming, but the point is, this is our home, this is our country, and they are not Americans, and they do not belong here.
[02:39:52.401 --> 02:39:56.282]  Well, Pat Buchanan, I want to talk about solutions to fight this, but you just brought up a central thing.
[02:39:56.622 --> 02:40:08.245]  I have a lot of Hispanic friends, hard-working, good, pro-family people, that even the liberal social engineering hasn't been able to break up their families and give them, you know, 90% of legitimacy like the poor black folks and 35% like the whites now.
[02:40:10.426 --> 02:40:16.730]  So you've got the wild men of the barrios, as you say, being given county, state, federal funding, Ford Foundation money.
[02:40:17.111 --> 02:40:25.196]  The elite, the CFR elite, you've talked about, paid for the comic books and the textbooks in Mexico, going back 30 years ago, saying that the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[02:40:25.657 --> 02:40:28.419]  And so they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:40:28.719 --> 02:40:34.223]  They're coming in and trying to turn the Mexicans, as soon as they get here, into American haters.
[02:40:34.463 --> 02:40:36.485]  So it goes right back to the CFR.
[02:40:36.785 --> 02:40:38.066]  How do we stop these people?
[02:40:38.755 --> 02:40:43.017]  Well, this is, I must say, Alex, you've almost got me stumped here.
[02:40:43.037 --> 02:40:52.642]  Look, when you get, in politics, you find when you get 70 or 80 percent of the people with you, the politicians for their own survival tend to move.
[02:40:53.283 --> 02:40:56.685]  But they're not moving, they're holding out, and something's stopping them.
[02:40:57.065 --> 02:41:02.968]  And the only thing I think that is that powerful is the K Street powers, all that money, are saying, look,
[02:41:03.889 --> 02:41:15.677]  In the Senate bill, there is a complete blanket pardon from all civil and criminal penalties for all businesses that hired illegals, as well as an amnesty for almost all the 12 million here.
[02:41:16.117 --> 02:41:25.543]  And I think behind this, holding up a tough border security bill only, holding that up, I think, are the corporations.
[02:41:25.603 --> 02:41:27.925]  Because they've got the biggest stake in this thing.
[02:41:28.325 --> 02:41:29.866]  They've got their guys at risk.
[02:41:30.325 --> 02:41:35.108]  A lot of these businessmen that hire people regularly, they pay the tuition of both parties.
[02:41:35.428 --> 02:41:43.312]  That seems to me to be the one big power that is behind the administration and the Congress refusing to act.
[02:41:45.013 --> 02:41:46.474]  Pat Buchanan, I agree with you.
[02:41:48.715 --> 02:41:52.777]  You were trying to get to the point about where we're going to be by 2050 if this continues.
[02:41:53.478 --> 02:41:59.541]  Well, I think it's... Look, if you don't stop it now, you're going to have the Native... I mean, the Americans of European
[02:41:59.983 --> 02:42:02.603]  Descent will be well under 50% of the population.
[02:42:03.204 --> 02:42:07.084]  Shrinking, we will, most of them will have moved away from the major cities of the country.
[02:42:07.564 --> 02:42:09.645]  Los Angeles will look like Mexico City.
[02:42:10.085 --> 02:42:13.405]  The cities of Texas... It already does, what are you talking about?
[02:42:13.505 --> 02:42:26.567]  Yeah, it already does, but I'll tell you, the cities of Texas will... Every city in America will look like Los Angeles today, and Los Angeles and the cities in the Southwest will look like Tijuana, Mexico City, and those cities like that.
[02:42:26.688 --> 02:42:28.388]  And it's inevitable.
[02:42:28.408 --> 02:42:29.368]  I mean, a hundred million?
[02:42:30.166 --> 02:42:33.049]  Hispanics, that's not a fact you can, and that's the Census Bureau.
[02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:42.199]  102 million Hispanics in the U.S., 25% of the population by 2050, more than 20 million concentrated in the Southwest.
[02:42:42.339 --> 02:42:47.745]  And our government financing the groups to make sure they hate the United States because they want to break up the U.S.
[02:42:47.805 --> 02:42:48.626]  and have an American Union.
[02:42:48.646 --> 02:42:49.326]  Look, it's simple.
[02:42:49.587 --> 02:42:50.608]  The globalists have told us.
[02:42:51.752 --> 02:42:55.834]  The middle class in this country was predominantly Chinese.
[02:42:57.214 --> 02:42:59.795]  The government would be waging war against them.
[02:42:59.815 --> 02:43:05.438]  The elites never want middle classes where you have upward mobility and where people aren't dependent on the government.
[02:43:05.658 --> 02:43:06.478]  They want a huge
[02:43:06.878 --> 02:43:10.079]  I've not seen numbers that high, but I will say this.
[02:43:10.099 --> 02:43:11.060]  I do believe that the
[02:43:34.878 --> 02:43:42.842]  The American middle and working class of this country, as I wrote in the title of an earlier book, are victims of a great betrayal.
[02:43:43.402 --> 02:43:46.383]  Their manufacturing jobs are being sent abroad.
[02:43:46.603 --> 02:43:49.645]  Illegal aliens are coming, being invited into their country.
[02:43:50.605 --> 02:43:55.887]  The products of China and things like that are pouring in, and American jobs are being lost.
[02:43:56.347 --> 02:44:01.970]  They're bringing in H-1Bs or bright young Indian kids or kids from Bangladesh to take the jobs.
[02:44:02.409 --> 02:44:05.330]  of Americans who are no longer in the defense industries.
[02:44:05.751 --> 02:44:07.791]  The middle class is under assault.
[02:44:07.851 --> 02:44:18.616]  You saw today where the median income of Americans, despite rising productivity, has fallen 2% since 2003 when the so-called Bush recovery happened.
[02:44:19.357 --> 02:44:26.780]  The middle class is falling behind, and the boys with the portfolios and the boys in the boardrooms are doing just fine.
[02:44:28.416 --> 02:44:33.300]  Well, they are, and so this is really an elite, waging war on the population.
[02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:42.987]  It is an elite, basically dismissing the interests and concerns, and frankly, the great concern of the middle class, they love the country.
[02:44:43.447 --> 02:44:44.308]  They love America.
[02:44:45.007 --> 02:44:46.828]  And the elites don't really care about that.
[02:44:46.868 --> 02:44:49.729]  They look upon the American people as consumers.
[02:44:49.769 --> 02:44:50.949]  They're all consumers.
[02:44:51.090 --> 02:44:53.470]  Pat, what are some solutions to this fight?
[02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:54.271]  How do we twist?
[02:44:54.291 --> 02:44:55.251]  I mean, you've worked in the White House.
[02:44:55.571 --> 02:44:57.332]  How do we twist Bush's arm?
[02:44:57.612 --> 02:44:58.973]  How do we twist the Democrats' arms?
[02:44:59.293 --> 02:45:02.314]  How do we demand that they build a continuous wall?
[02:45:02.694 --> 02:45:05.335]  How do we demand that we start massive deportations?
[02:45:05.615 --> 02:45:12.078]  How do we demand that we start charging people with felonies who hire large groups of illegal aliens to work in their factories?
[02:45:12.618 --> 02:45:19.805]  I think we're going to have to encourage folks at the state and local level to take action against the illegal aliens and be very, very tough on it.
[02:45:20.206 --> 02:45:22.668]  This will keep the issue in front of these people, frankly.
[02:45:22.688 --> 02:45:28.033]  And then, come November, I think you go up to them and say, look, I don't care what you've done for me in the past.
[02:45:28.574 --> 02:45:34.880]  You vote for amnesty, you vote for the guest worker program, and you oppose a security fence along the border.
[02:45:35.345 --> 02:45:39.329]  And I'm going to vote against you, and I'm going to work against you, and we're going to defeat you.
[02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:41.251]  And if you're a Republican, too bad.
[02:45:41.271 --> 02:45:45.435]  We'll maybe get in Republicans who believe more in preserving this country.
[02:45:45.796 --> 02:45:46.416]  That is it.
[02:45:46.516 --> 02:45:47.497]  This is the ballot.
[02:45:47.898 --> 02:45:51.902]  This is the single vote on which we're going to hold you accountable.
[02:45:53.340 --> 02:46:01.083]  And I think that, I mean, obviously the establishment's got to know that if things are already this heated in 2006, what's it going to be like in 5, 10 years?
[02:46:01.163 --> 02:46:07.064]  I mean, this is going to get... Well, this book of mine, I'll tell you, the book is, you know, The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America.
[02:46:07.485 --> 02:46:08.985]  This issue is going to be here in 2006, 2008, 2010.
[02:46:12.165 --> 02:46:13.905]  Because the whole world is coming.
[02:46:14.245 --> 02:46:15.646]  They're coming to that southern border.
[02:46:15.686 --> 02:46:17.186]  The Mexicans aren't going to stop coming.
[02:46:17.386 --> 02:46:19.466]  They're not going to stop being pushed into the country.
[02:46:19.647 --> 02:46:21.467]  There's 6 billion people that want to come here.
[02:46:22.347 --> 02:46:23.487]  We can't have them all here.
[02:46:23.547 --> 02:46:27.308]  Folks, you don't want to live like they do in India or they do in Mexico City.
[02:46:27.368 --> 02:46:27.988]  Travel there.
[02:46:28.048 --> 02:46:29.088]  Look at it for yourself.
[02:46:29.168 --> 02:46:30.229]  It's hell on earth.
[02:46:30.669 --> 02:46:34.710]  And people say, well, let them come here and then that'll take the heat off the other countries.
[02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:40.271]  We could take 50 million a year and it wouldn't even touch global third world population growth.
[02:46:40.571 --> 02:46:41.191]  Let me tell you.
[02:46:42.191 --> 02:46:50.036]  Alex, each 18 months, the third world adds the equivalent of an entire Mexico in population.
[02:46:50.496 --> 02:46:56.780]  A hundred million people are added to third world populations every 18 months.
[02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:02.863]  We're going to have three billion more people by 2050 in this world than you have now.
[02:47:03.363 --> 02:47:08.386]  And all of them know now that what the place to go is the good old USA.
[02:47:08.426 --> 02:47:09.507]  You don't get deported.
[02:47:09.966 --> 02:47:11.188]  You don't get roughed up.
[02:47:11.268 --> 02:47:12.690]  You can have leprosy.
[02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:15.875]  You might be able to get a job, but you can make ten times what you made at home.
[02:47:16.135 --> 02:47:17.177]  Pat, let me bring this up real quick.
[02:47:17.197 --> 02:47:17.978]  I want to come back in front of you.
[02:47:17.998 --> 02:47:18.839]  I have one or two calls in.
[02:47:18.879 --> 02:47:20.181]  I'm sorry we haven't gone to your calls yet.
[02:47:20.502 --> 02:47:21.163]  Load of phones here.
[02:47:22.140 --> 02:47:25.242]  Uh, we had four cases of leprosy until 2004.
[02:47:25.362 --> 02:47:25.962]  Now we've had 7,000.
[02:47:26.142 --> 02:47:28.363]  We have a leper colony in East Texas.
[02:47:28.784 --> 02:47:30.404]  TB is exploding everywhere.
[02:47:30.745 --> 02:47:34.566]  I mean, at least they tested people, even Europeans, everybody coming in at Ellis Island.
[02:47:34.647 --> 02:47:40.389]  Now, it's just people can walk off planes with leprosy splattering all over the place, and it's just like, wonderful!
[02:47:40.469 --> 02:47:42.250]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:47:42.531 --> 02:47:45.092]  Well, I saw over the weekend, Drudge had a report.
[02:47:45.652 --> 02:47:48.434]  Twelve or thirteen cases of bubonic plague they found.
[02:47:48.854 --> 02:47:49.094]  TB.
[02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:56.962]  Immigrant children are a hundred times more likely to be carrying TB into the classroom than native-born American children.
[02:47:57.482 --> 02:47:59.405]  One in every seven East Asians.
[02:47:59.989 --> 02:48:03.970]  In New York City, that's 100,000 people, has tuberculosis.
[02:48:04.450 --> 02:48:05.750]  You've got dengue fever.
[02:48:05.790 --> 02:48:07.731]  You've got Chagas's disease coming in.
[02:48:08.111 --> 02:48:09.631]  You've got malaria coming in.
[02:48:09.691 --> 02:48:12.132]  Things we cured and things we never had in America.
[02:48:12.352 --> 02:48:15.653]  You read reports of bedbugs found in all these states.
[02:48:15.713 --> 02:48:16.813]  Where do they think they're coming?
[02:48:17.053 --> 02:48:19.754]  The illegal aliens go through no check whatsoever.
[02:48:19.774 --> 02:48:21.814]  They come in and they bring these with them.
[02:48:22.214 --> 02:48:29.543]  Again, and the media keeps it almost completely quiet because they've got to do it to break down the Republic.
[02:48:29.583 --> 02:48:31.025]  The country is under attack.
[02:48:31.065 --> 02:48:34.730]  George Bush is directing those attacks with his neocon traitors.
[02:48:34.970 --> 02:48:35.651]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:35.711 --> 02:48:37.994]  Final segment with Pat Buchanan to take a few of your calls.
[02:48:44.318 --> 02:48:44.798]  It's here!
[02:48:45.018 --> 02:48:49.799]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:50.159 --> 02:48:57.821]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:58.481 --> 02:49:05.542]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.943 --> 02:49:12.804]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:13.334 --> 02:49:17.377]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.677 --> 02:49:21.180]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:23.561]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.902 --> 02:49:27.804]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:48.498 --> 02:50:50.739]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[02:51:27.142 --> 02:51:30.225]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.

[02:51:50.186 --> 02:51:55.368]  It's so important to understand that the New World Order has to destroy the United States to get their world government.
[02:51:55.788 --> 02:52:03.651]  Pat Buchanan, do you think the globalists are overplaying their hand and that they're not going to be able to carry out their American Union and open borders and the rest of it?
[02:52:04.031 --> 02:52:08.993]  Or will they just crack down with their police state and enforce the destruction of this country?
[02:52:09.673 --> 02:52:19.337]  I believe that the American people are so aroused here and they're so... I mean, they're so intently patriotic and against these ideas
[02:52:20.086 --> 02:52:21.926]  Of merging America with another country.
[02:52:21.946 --> 02:52:24.767]  I think we've got a fighting chance on this one.
[02:52:25.447 --> 02:52:30.648]  The President, I think if the Republicans do not secure these borders, I think they're going to be wiped out.
[02:52:31.108 --> 02:52:35.169]  Now, the Democrats aren't going to do it either, but you'll get a new kind of Republican Party coming.
[02:52:37.129 --> 02:52:39.550]  Yeah, get rid of all the Rockefeller New World Order Republicans?
[02:52:39.570 --> 02:52:41.430]  Well, yeah, that's the only way to do it.
[02:52:41.450 --> 02:52:45.771]  I mean, you've got the Crystals and the Weekly Standard crowd and all the rest of them.
[02:52:46.778 --> 02:52:48.299]  Lobbyists for La Raza there.
[02:52:48.319 --> 02:52:53.584]  You got Karl Rove going out speaking to La Raza, competing with Clinton.
[02:52:53.764 --> 02:52:54.564]  For heaven's sakes!
[02:52:55.245 --> 02:52:56.046]  Let's take a call.
[02:52:56.146 --> 02:52:57.267]  Sean in Arizona.
[02:52:57.287 --> 02:52:58.488]  You're on the air with Pat Buchanan.
[02:52:59.168 --> 02:53:00.649]  Hi, glad to be on the show, Pat.
[02:53:01.410 --> 02:53:14.501]  I have Mexican-American friends here in Arizona, and I was talking to one, and he is just up in arms about these La Raza people coming in, saying that this is Mexico, and in his opinion,
[02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:23.686]  If this doesn't get taken care of, the citizens of Arizona, including naturalized Mexicans, are going to start taking care of it themselves.
[02:53:24.186 --> 02:53:28.089]  Well, you know, that's an excellent point.
[02:53:28.109 --> 02:53:39.296]  47% of Mexican-Americans in Arizona voted in favor of Proposition 200, which requires folks to prove they belong here before they get social welfare benefits.
[02:53:39.597 --> 02:53:41.518]  Yet the whole Republican delegation
[02:53:42.279 --> 02:53:45.480]  Opposed it, as did the Democratic Governor and all the elites there.
[02:53:45.860 --> 02:53:53.721]  But Mexican-Americans are patriotic people, they're hard-working people, they have great values, many of them belong to the same faith as I do.
[02:53:53.862 --> 02:54:01.203]  And I've talked to them and they're upset because everybody was getting along before, now millions of people are running around saying they're going to kill whites and it's causing friction.
[02:54:01.443 --> 02:54:04.864]  Exactly, and I can't imagine people tramping around under foreign flags.
[02:54:05.244 --> 02:54:10.005]  These folks have lived under the American flag, many of them have fought under the American flag,
[02:54:10.626 --> 02:54:17.351]  And the idea that these people are coming in and representing themselves as, you know, somehow Mexican-Americans is preposterous!
[02:54:17.591 --> 02:54:19.873]  Final caller, Caleb in Texas.
[02:54:19.893 --> 02:54:22.495]  You're on the air with Pat Buchanan with the new book, State of Emergency.
[02:54:22.535 --> 02:54:22.895]  Go ahead.
[02:54:23.155 --> 02:54:23.736]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:54:23.856 --> 02:54:25.237]  Pat Buchanan, one question.
[02:54:25.737 --> 02:54:33.483]  If 9-11 and George Bush's war on terror is indeed legitimate, why wasn't the border totally militarily secured on September 12, 2001?
[02:54:35.204 --> 02:54:37.946]  It's because George Bush doesn't want
[02:54:38.399 --> 02:54:39.560]  To secure that border.
[02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:43.142]  I do believe he wants an open border between the United States and Mexico.
[02:54:43.542 --> 02:54:49.505]  He does not share the concern of a lot of us that this is a national security problem.
[02:54:49.525 --> 02:54:52.607]  Pat, won't he just get more power if there's another terror attack?
[02:54:52.707 --> 02:54:54.188]  Then he can take more American liberties?
[02:54:54.608 --> 02:55:00.792]  I think if the terrorists have come across that Mexican border, I think his place in history is finished.
[02:55:02.208 --> 02:55:07.612]  But my point is, if he got so much power out of 9-11 and got the grandstand... Right.
[02:55:07.672 --> 02:55:08.333]  No doubt about it.
[02:55:08.393 --> 02:55:10.374]  I mean, war is the health of the state.
[02:55:10.454 --> 02:55:11.795]  You know it as well as I do, Alex.
[02:55:11.875 --> 02:55:17.319]  So do you agree with me that they could try to spin it, even though common sense, we would see it, that there was another attack.
[02:55:17.459 --> 02:55:21.222]  They could kind of spin it and ignore the border issue, and Bush could get even more power out of it.
[02:55:21.562 --> 02:55:23.523]  Well, yeah, sure, sure.
[02:55:23.664 --> 02:55:26.165]  He could put in a lot more laws and things like that.
[02:55:26.546 --> 02:55:28.167]  But I do think people would say, look,
[02:55:28.979 --> 02:55:32.020]  You did not seal that border, just as the caller said.
[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:36.661]  When you had three or four, you had four years, or five years to do it, you didn't do it.
[02:55:37.281 --> 02:55:38.541]  And now we got hit again.
[02:55:39.041 --> 02:55:40.642]  You are responsible this time.
[02:55:41.102 --> 02:55:43.402]  Eisenhower sealed it, and deported a million.
[02:55:43.862 --> 02:55:46.483]  Eisenhower sealed it, and Operation Wetback.
[02:55:46.843 --> 02:55:49.824]  Sure he did, he saw a threat to the country, he said, what's going on down there?
[02:55:50.324 --> 02:55:54.345]  And he sent another general, Joseph Mace Wayne, he said, you know, deal with this Joe!
[02:55:55.484 --> 02:55:57.506]  And again, people try to say that term is racist.
[02:55:57.566 --> 02:55:59.187]  They turn every term into racism.
[02:55:59.207 --> 02:56:00.968]  It just means you swam over the river.
[02:56:01.128 --> 02:56:03.330]  Exactly, or you waded across, for heaven's sakes.
[02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:06.652]  Yeah, they would call it that because they'd catch people at the border and they'd be wet.
[02:56:06.973 --> 02:56:08.214]  Pat Buchanan, thank you.
[02:56:08.254 --> 02:56:10.035]  Your book's number one state of emergency.
[02:56:10.055 --> 02:56:10.836]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:56:10.856 --> 02:56:11.876]  Hope to talk to you again soon.
[02:56:12.137 --> 02:56:12.637]  Thank you.
[02:56:13.057 --> 02:56:13.558]  God bless.
[02:56:13.618 --> 02:56:14.018]  All right.
