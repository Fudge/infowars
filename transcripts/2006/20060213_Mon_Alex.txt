[00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:06.288]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:08.029]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:09.830]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:11.311]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:12.933]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.953 --> 00:00:17.316]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:21.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.749]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.654]  It is Monday, the 13th day of February 2006.
[00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:45.119]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.601]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:52.467]  I would imagine that many of you have tuned in to hear what I have to say about Dick Cheney, just south of me.
[00:00:53.047 --> 00:01:00.473]  Several days ago, blasting one of his hunting buddies with his 28 gauge peashooter shotgun.
[00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.695]  I didn't even know they had 28 gauges.
[00:01:02.715 --> 00:01:06.438]  I thought they were 12 gauge was a smaller shotgun.
[00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:09.180]  He moved on down to the 10 gauges and the 8 gauges.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.321]  Okay, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:16.806]  I have gone duck hunting with 10 gauges, but most men use 12 gauges.
[00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:17.767]  Most women do.
[00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:25.252]  A 28 gauge is something that you would imagine Tom Thumb, who's 3 inches tall, to be using.
[00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:38.303]  But I will spend some time on this very suspicious story from a lot of different angles, but frankly, there's a lot of other news that is a lot more important that we will get into first today.
[00:01:39.088 --> 00:01:43.771]  Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, backs a deal on the USA Patriot Act.
[00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.914]  It doesn't matter if he's tied into Abramoff and many others.
[00:01:46.954 --> 00:01:50.856]  He can engage in even more criminal activity against the American people.
[00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:53.118]  The really big news is the U.S.
[00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:57.221]  government preparing military blitz against Iran's nuclear sites.
[00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:59.282]  This is out of a London telegraph.
[00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:04.566]  The really serious news, other reports, the Pentagon plans bomb blitz on Iran's nuclear sites.
[00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:05.807]  That out of the age.
[00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:09.074]  Iran resumes Adam and Richmond work.
[00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:10.675]  That's what the diplomats are saying.
[00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:17.358]  Syria has switched to the Euro amid confrontation with the United States.
[00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.619]  Thousands would die in U.S.
[00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.960]  strikes on Iran, says a major study.
[00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:23.921]  This out of The Guardian.
[00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:33.426]  So, I really want to spend some time getting into Iran, which is on, not even the horizon, it's now on the front burner.
[00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:43.130]  Meanwhile, police gas students protesting the Mohammedan cartoons, this out of Pakistan, the Associated Press.
[00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.357]  And then over the weekend, yet again, different surrogates, different foils, different minions.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:06.232]  Different shills, different puppets, different spokesmen, front men, PR specialists, propagandists, general boobs have been going all over television and print and the radio telling us that the President is above the law.
[00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:10.055]  We have the quotes here from Meet the Press and I want to go over some of that.
[00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:13.258]  And the headline is, is the President above the law?
[00:03:13.838 --> 00:03:24.068]  I'm glad that the mainstream media is starting to figure out what a serious issue this is, because the executive is declaring dictatorial, or the powers of a dictator, i.e.
[00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:25.549]  dictatorship.
[00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:35.218]  They are inventing and setting up a classical dictatorship by every definition of the word and the term itself.
[00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.432]  So we will get into those two top stories, really three top stories.
[00:03:40.472 --> 00:03:43.554]  Big developments on the Patriot Act, reauthorization and expansion.
[00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:47.577]  We also have the Iran war situation.
[00:03:47.617 --> 00:03:49.278]  What's happening with the Mohammed cartoons.
[00:03:49.298 --> 00:03:50.439]  What's happening in Syria.
[00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.942]  That all ties together with the Middle East and Central Asia news.
[00:03:54.602 --> 00:04:00.467]  And we then have Dick Cheney blasting one of his hunting buddies.
[00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:02.468]  Just absolutely pathetic.
[00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.270]  Very hard to do
[00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:13.299]  In fact, the average person doesn't hunt and hasn't done any quail hunting so they don't understand that this person was behind Chaney.
[00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:23.621]  Chaney had no impulse control and did a 180 turned around and shot behind him knowing the hunting party was behind them.
[00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:34.604]  You only shoot forwards in a line and there is a, I'd say about a maybe 80 degree angle that you can move from side to side in shooting
[00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.967]  And it's just classic idiocy, if you can believe the official story.
[00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:42.468]  Well, we'll get into that.
[00:04:43.308 --> 00:04:44.548]  Pretty pathetic stuff.
[00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:47.229]  And there's some reports saying that it looks suspicious.
[00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.671]  Looks very, very suspicious.
[00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:54.132]  Why'd they keep it secret for 18 plus hours?
[00:04:54.492 --> 00:04:59.194]  InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:02.173 --> 00:05:09.557]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.817 --> 00:05:14.580]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.443]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.683 --> 00:05:25.204]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:32.586]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.606 --> 00:05:33.386]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:05:33.426 --> 00:05:37.127]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:39.807]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:46.749]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:02.793]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:08.505]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:12.148]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:19.894]  Now even the controlled mainstream media is saying, is the President above the law?
[00:08:20.315 --> 00:08:22.897]  Is he allowed to have the powers of a dictator?
[00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:23.998]  And they're saying, maybe.
[00:08:24.844 --> 00:08:25.745]  Maybe so.
[00:08:26.385 --> 00:08:27.946]  It's being introduced to us.
[00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:29.087]  We're being trained.
[00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:30.608]  We're being acclimated.
[00:08:30.648 --> 00:08:31.529]  We're being conditioned.
[00:08:31.549 --> 00:08:32.270]  I want to get into that.
[00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.692]  A lot of big developments with the Iran situation.
[00:08:35.952 --> 00:08:38.174]  Also with the Mohammed cartoons.
[00:08:38.794 --> 00:08:43.378]  Syria just dumped the dollar and a lot of Americans will laugh at that and say, so what?
[00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:50.163]  Well, you won't be saying so what when the dollar is basically as worthless as the Mexican peso.
[00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.842]  So we'll get into that today.
[00:08:53.162 --> 00:09:02.888]  You know, we're going to have wide open phones for all three hours, and I'd like to hear from callers on any issue you'd like to discuss, any news item, any story from over the weekend.
[00:09:02.928 --> 00:09:08.832]  But I would also like you to chime in, if you feel like it, on the looming war with Iran.
[00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:10.593]  We're now learning some of the details.
[00:09:10.613 --> 00:09:20.679]  The Pentagon has been floating and releasing some of its battle plans, and how they're planning to strike Iran, and how at least the preliminary attack
[00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:26.644]  will unfold that could come any day or next month or six months from now or could never come.
[00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:37.209]  The CIA's own big official assessment is ten years if they were left alone and given the equipment they needed to build primitive A-bombs, but the general public doesn't care.
[00:09:37.229 --> 00:09:45.073]  They've heard the word nuclear, nuclear, atomic, atomic, removing the seals, atomic, atomic, removing the seals, nuclear, over and over again.
[00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:47.234]  It has as much basis in reality as
[00:09:47.914 --> 00:09:55.060]  Fox News last Friday showing video of Independence Day from the mid-nineties with aliens blowing up the library tower.
[00:09:55.421 --> 00:10:07.311]  Bush renames it the Liberty Tower and says, look, the enemy plans to do this, and they cut to clips of aliens blowing up buildings, and he says the surveillance has kept you safe from things like this.
[00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:12.255]  Let's cut now to video of Hollywood production of aliens attacking.
[00:10:13.186 --> 00:10:23.535]  And so Iran having the A-bomb is about as real as aliens blowing up the library tower that Bush, because it sounded better, renamed the Liberty Tower.
[00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.377]  No one even questions it.
[00:10:25.437 --> 00:10:26.678]  So that's coming up.
[00:10:26.698 --> 00:10:28.399]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:28.459]  800-259-9231.
[00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:38.187]  And if you disagree with me, go to the front of the line.
[00:10:38.227 --> 00:10:46.689]  If you're calling from out of country, we'll also take you up to, at least near the top of the line, especially if you're a first-time caller or haven't called on a routine basis.
[00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:51.010]  And first-time callers are always given preferential treatment as well.
[00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.550]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:57.531]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:05.693]  Let me just comment on Dick Cheney, two and a half days ago, shooting his buddy in the face.
[00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:10.184]  and in the body with a 28-gauge shotgun.
[00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:20.410]  I don't claim to be an aficionado or an authority on guns but I know more than most people and I'm sorry I just had never seen or heard of a 28-gauge shotgun.
[00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.091]  I had to go look it up online this morning.
[00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:31.416]  It is a teeny tiny little effeminate pea shooter that is associated with six-year-olds you're teaching how to bird hunt.
[00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:40.612]  So it just shows what a insipid quit chaining is to begin with, that he's out there hunting with a 28 gauge shotgun.
[00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:41.692]  It's really pathetic.
[00:11:42.032 --> 00:11:50.514]  So the guy can't be hurt too bad if he really shot him at 30 yards like we're claiming with this number 8 or number 9 bird shot.
[00:11:50.755 --> 00:11:53.735]  Though from what we're hearing in the news it looks like it could be a lower number, i.e.
[00:11:54.136 --> 00:11:55.536]  larger pellet size.
[00:11:56.443 --> 00:12:01.487]  I mean, up at eight or nine, the stuff's like powder that shoots out of those rifles.
[00:12:01.507 --> 00:12:06.910]  I don't even know why someone would hunt with a shot that high.
[00:12:08.331 --> 00:12:13.175]  But, number one, Americans aren't taught gun safety.
[00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:16.777]  I believe in the Second Amendment 110%.
[00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:18.319]  I believe in right to carry.
[00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:21.401]  I believe there should be no gun laws.
[00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:25.724]  In fact, I believe that felons should be able to own a gun, because
[00:12:26.807 --> 00:12:36.054]  Back when this country was a much freer society, when you got out of prison, if you'd have been arrested with your guns, they would actually give you your guns when you got out of prison.
[00:12:36.675 --> 00:12:49.225]  Just back in my dad's day, he could carry his shotgun into school and put it in his locker if he was going dove or quail hunting with somebody after school, or his deer rifle if he was going to a friend's house to go hunting on their property.
[00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:53.546]  And that was only back in the 1950s, early 1960s.
[00:12:53.946 --> 00:12:55.127]  Things have really changed.
[00:12:55.187 --> 00:12:57.248]  You had hardly any accidents in this country.
[00:12:57.508 --> 00:12:59.188]  Statistically, the numbers were much lower.
[00:12:59.588 --> 00:13:01.749]  You had much higher rate of gun ownership.
[00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:06.150]  But everyone got the same training.
[00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.952]  And I am blessed enough that I got training that is basically extinct today.
[00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:21.095]  Yes, when I was five years old, well I'm gonna really be honest with people, I was sat in my father's lap with a .410 shotgun when I was four years old.
[00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:24.417]  Some people will find that unbelievable, but it's actually true.
[00:13:25.658 --> 00:13:29.800]  Ryan Baxter and myself were taken down to the farm when we were four years old.
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.061]  He was five, I was four.
[00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:38.466]  And we sat back on the back lawn of my grandmother's manicured back lawn, right off the back of a big ranch.
[00:13:39.373 --> 00:13:46.117]  And put coffee cans about 10 feet out in front of us and my dad held the shotgun and let me aim it and pull the trigger.
[00:13:46.918 --> 00:13:59.345]  And that was just to get a child acclimated to how a firearm operates and to train them to accept the recoil and to accept the loud noise and the smoke from a very young age.
[00:13:59.365 --> 00:14:02.727]  And frankly this is a training that people got for several hundred years in this country.
[00:14:04.048 --> 00:14:05.289]  So from that point on
[00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:12.948]  Then I was not allowed to touch a gun or shoot a gun until I was about six or seven and we would go out to the farm and ranch.
[00:14:13.248 --> 00:14:16.733]  I would see them shooting and I was not even allowed to touch the guns.
[00:14:16.793 --> 00:14:19.917]  I was made to sit there and watch and taught safety over and over again.
[00:14:19.937 --> 00:14:22.581]  Never aim a gun at something you're not planning to shoot.
[00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:23.062]  Always
[00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:24.302]  We're good to go!
[00:14:39.448 --> 00:14:53.497]  And I would, even when I was 12 years old, point it at the dog, or point it at the cat, or point it at a friend, and my dad would just go take my guns out of the gun safe, take them down to the farm, and I wouldn't be allowed to shoot for a year.
[00:14:53.817 --> 00:14:55.438]  Which is something I always begged to do.
[00:14:56.159 --> 00:15:02.743]  And so once or twice that happened, it really broke me of any habit of even aiming a toy gun at someone.
[00:15:03.023 --> 00:15:05.145]  You don't aim BB guns at people.
[00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:07.326]  You don't do things like that.
[00:15:08.926 --> 00:15:12.632]  And this is the type of proper gun safety that I was taught.
[00:15:12.672 --> 00:15:16.057]  And I'm not as good a shot as I was when I was 14 years of age.
[00:15:16.077 --> 00:15:16.758]  By the time I was 14...
[00:15:18.346 --> 00:15:30.189]  At 200 yards with a .243 with a three power scope, I could shoot the top off of a Tabasco bottle, a tiny little red cap, from 200 yards every single time I tried.
[00:15:30.649 --> 00:15:40.071]  By the time I was 16, when I probably hit my peak, no, about 18, I was able to shoot at a 200 yard range through the same hole five times in a row.
[00:15:40.091 --> 00:15:41.012]  Do you understand?
[00:15:41.072 --> 00:15:42.712]  Through the same hole.
[00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:45.705]  Now that's what gun training does.
[00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:48.608]  That's what training with the Second Amendment does.
[00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:53.815]  And that's why when our country had to go to war in the past, no one could stop us.
[00:15:54.679 --> 00:16:01.401]  That's why the Germans called the Marines the Devil Dogs, because they were off of Alabama and Texas and Ohio farms.
[00:16:01.762 --> 00:16:05.743]  And they'd grown up with a gun in their hand, a rifle, a shotgun in their hand.
[00:16:06.083 --> 00:16:10.145]  Now, enter Dick Cheney into the equation.
[00:16:10.245 --> 00:16:19.268]  Running around with a gun that you train a six-year-old on, running around with a rifle, a shotgun, a scatter gun, a modern blunderbuss,
[00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:24.752]  Running around with this thing, now let me just tell you how it works when you're quail hunting.
[00:16:25.013 --> 00:16:29.055]  Not that I'm some master at quail hunting, I've been able to do as much as I'd like, just maybe 30 or 40 times.
[00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:31.536]  I've done a lot more dove hunting.
[00:16:32.176 --> 00:16:39.140]  What you do is, you go out into the bush, the scrub, where the quail tend to like to roost, down on the ground.
[00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:44.802]  There's not that many quail in Texas anymore in the last 20 years because of the fire ants.
[00:16:44.843 --> 00:16:49.306]  A Brazilian ant that came in in the 1940's and now is taking over most of the Southwest.
[00:16:50.507 --> 00:16:58.053]  I guess it was a farm in South Texas where they're releasing quail because you basically have to do that to have any population to begin with.
[00:16:58.473 --> 00:17:04.618]  This Armstrong Ranch does sound like some type of palatial, lavish facility.
[00:17:05.695 --> 00:17:17.703]  And they're down there, and when you're quail hunting, number one, you don't ever want to get your group bigger than four or five people, and this group supposedly was five people, three hunters and then two assistants, or four hunters and two assistants, or six people.
[00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:21.246]  The story keeps changing, so it's either five or six people.
[00:17:22.126 --> 00:17:23.647]  Three or four hunters, we don't know yet.
[00:17:24.728 --> 00:17:32.353]  And they're walking out, and they're not walking in a line, because how this works is, imagine you're standing at the middle of the dial of a clock, okay?
[00:17:33.749 --> 00:17:39.651]  You're allowed to shoot out in front of you from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock.
[00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:44.332]  And you really shouldn't even swing your gun barrel around to 9 or to 3.
[00:17:44.732 --> 00:17:45.172]  You understand?
[00:17:45.192 --> 00:17:46.953]  You've got the front half of the dial.
[00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:51.134]  Facing straight out ahead of you is midnight.
[00:17:51.194 --> 00:17:51.834]  It's 12.
[00:17:52.554 --> 00:17:53.315]  It's the numeral 12.
[00:17:53.835 --> 00:17:54.195]  Okay?
[00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:58.176]  And so you never shoot behind you.
[00:17:58.934 --> 00:18:08.218]  In fact, you really shouldn't be shooting in any type of field of vision from anywhere from... I mean, the most you can do it is 9 to 3.
[00:18:08.918 --> 00:18:10.438]  Personally, I would say 10 to 2.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:23.388]  I mean, listen, I've been out shooting with people, and if somebody aims a gun at somebody, or is driving in their truck with it pointed up towards their heads, I've been with people who just go, hey, we're not going to go hunting.
[00:18:23.408 --> 00:18:24.129]  You've got to go back.
[00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:24.930]  We're taking you back.
[00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:31.195]  Whoever the good old boy was that didn't know which end of the gun to aim, or if somebody swung their gun wrong, they'd say, that's it!
[00:18:31.475 --> 00:18:31.995]  Hunt's over!
[00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:34.477]  Listen, bud, you need to go take some safety courses.
[00:18:34.497 --> 00:18:36.199]  We're going to take you back on the four-wheel.
[00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:37.320]  We're going to go hunting.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.501]  Or, okay, that's it.
[00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:41.103]  We're going to go eat, and then you leave that guy and you go back.
[00:18:41.323 --> 00:18:44.946]  I mean, you're not supposed to put up with this, because you get your head blown off.
[00:18:45.206 --> 00:18:46.146]  Somebody will die.
[00:18:46.427 --> 00:18:48.468]  If you follow the rules, it's completely safe.
[00:18:50.009 --> 00:18:52.451]  And it's people like this that make the Second Amendment look bad.
[00:18:55.273 --> 00:18:57.675]  But no, it is right here in the Associated Press
[00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:07.379]  From their own weird story, we don't even know if this is true, that the Texas Austin lawyer that Cheney peppered was behind them.
[00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:25.107]  He'd shot a bird, the dogs had gotten it, Cheney and his other hunting partner had moved on, and then a quail took off, some quail took off, flew past them, Cheney swiveled around at a 180, it says it right here in the news, and shot this guy from 30 yards away.
[00:19:26.028 --> 00:19:26.728]  Now that is
[00:19:27.498 --> 00:19:30.080]  Let me tell you, if somebody did that, you'd scream at them.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.781]  What is your problem?
[00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:32.562]  Get out of here!
[00:19:32.582 --> 00:19:35.224]  I mean, if anybody did that with a rifle.
[00:19:36.845 --> 00:19:37.665]  With a shotgun.
[00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:42.549]  I mean, that is just... That is insane.
[00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:46.271]  And every time I read the newspaper, Cheney's off hunting.
[00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:50.314]  The guy's a complete... He has no impulse control, is what it is.
[00:19:50.354 --> 00:19:51.635]  He just saw that quail.
[00:19:52.876 --> 00:19:53.817]  And he had to shoot it.
[00:19:53.837 --> 00:19:57.039]  It didn't matter if somebody was behind it when he pulled the trigger.
[00:19:57.634 --> 00:19:58.354]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.394 --> 00:20:00.435]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.475 --> 00:20:09.998]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:20:10.218 --> 00:20:12.039]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:13.399]  That's one in four adults.
[00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:19.853]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:21:04.704 --> 00:21:10.187]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.747 --> 00:21:11.267]  That's right.
[00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:14.229]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:21.333]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:29.607]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.048 --> 00:21:34.912]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:38.536]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.318 --> 00:21:45.463]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[00:21:46.103 --> 00:21:47.585]  Make sure that you secure your future.

[00:23:02.728 --> 00:23:03.449]  Listen up, folks.
[00:23:03.509 --> 00:23:04.730]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.291]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:23:07.411 --> 00:23:08.152]  You heard that right.
[00:23:08.232 --> 00:23:10.714]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:23:10.974 --> 00:23:12.035]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:23:12.175 --> 00:23:13.376]  The banks are defrauding you.
[00:23:13.716 --> 00:23:15.117]  Now's the time to fight back.

[00:24:07.694 --> 00:24:11.436]  Well, Dennis Hastert, back to deal on the USA Patriot Act.
[00:24:11.456 --> 00:24:11.857]  The U.S.
[00:24:11.897 --> 00:24:14.959]  prepares military blitz against Iran's nuclear sites.
[00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:16.620]  Syria dumps the dollar.
[00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:21.264]  Bunch of news on torture and the police state her domestically.
[00:24:21.664 --> 00:24:24.166]  Mainstream media ask the question, is Bush a dictator?
[00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:25.006]  Is he above the law?
[00:24:25.246 --> 00:24:27.528]  But they pose it in a good way, like, hey, maybe he is.
[00:24:27.608 --> 00:24:28.509]  Maybe that's good.
[00:24:29.824 --> 00:24:32.725]  Most of the public doesn't understand that and may go along with it.
[00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:33.945]  Oh, he's our supreme ruler!
[00:24:34.205 --> 00:24:42.066]  Maybe he should start wearing a crown and have a scepter and have ten white horses drag him around in a big carriage and we should kneel before him.
[00:24:42.806 --> 00:24:44.987]  Maybe his children should become empresses.
[00:24:45.047 --> 00:24:45.707]  I mean, who knows?
[00:24:45.787 --> 00:24:47.227]  So that's coming up.
[00:24:47.647 --> 00:24:57.129]  Just on the hunting situation, Dick Cheney really should get in trouble, at least fined or something, for
[00:24:58.286 --> 00:24:59.107]  For what he did.
[00:24:59.127 --> 00:25:03.749]  And I cannot figure out why people will say go to a national park.
[00:25:04.489 --> 00:25:11.353]  National parks will have certain sectors or state parks where for a weekend or two during deer season you can go hunting.
[00:25:11.954 --> 00:25:25.381]  Which I think is all fine and dandy with the people's land but you wouldn't catch me dead in the woods say in a thousand acres with fifty to a hundred hunters running around with deer rifles.
[00:25:26.081 --> 00:25:30.885]  With .30-06 and .308s and .270s and .243s.
[00:25:32.246 --> 00:25:35.349]  All the time, every hunting season, they're just out blasting each other.
[00:25:35.749 --> 00:25:40.713]  Guys that just really want to shoot something and they see movement, so they open fire.
[00:25:42.234 --> 00:25:51.882]  I can't think of anything more terrifying than being out there with all these city slickers dressed up like Elmer Fudd, blasting in every direction.
[00:25:52.566 --> 00:25:54.887]  Because they have no impulse control all the time.
[00:25:54.907 --> 00:25:56.087]  They shoot somebody's cow.
[00:25:56.387 --> 00:25:57.568]  They shoot somebody's horse.
[00:25:57.888 --> 00:25:59.208]  They shoot a park ranger.
[00:25:59.268 --> 00:26:00.088]  They shoot a cop.
[00:26:00.128 --> 00:26:01.169]  They shoot a fellow hunter.
[00:26:01.409 --> 00:26:02.509]  They shoot a game warden.
[00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:05.310]  And they say, why did you shoot me, if the person even lived?
[00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.671]  Well, I saw you moving.
[00:26:07.771 --> 00:26:09.071]  I was wearing a big orange vest.
[00:26:09.371 --> 00:26:11.392]  I know, but I saw antlers!
[00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:14.147]  I saw antlers!
[00:26:14.827 --> 00:26:16.289]  I saw Mia Deer!
[00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.112]  And that's exactly what Dick Cheney did.
[00:26:19.713 --> 00:26:21.515]  The quail took off, flew over him.
[00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:22.956]  He followed it with a gun.
[00:26:22.976 --> 00:26:24.838]  A 180, they're saying.
[00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:29.664]  This person they shot, this Austin lawyer, was behind them.
[00:26:29.744 --> 00:26:31.486]  Behind them.
[00:26:34.714 --> 00:26:37.274]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:26:37.355 --> 00:26:38.495]  And I'm done talking about it.
[00:26:38.515 --> 00:26:40.175]  I'm sure callers are going to want to bring it up.
[00:26:40.575 --> 00:26:41.535]  And that's fine and dandy.
[00:26:41.555 --> 00:26:42.735]  We'll do that in the next segment.
[00:26:43.156 --> 00:26:46.296]  But compared to all this other news, it really doesn't matter.
[00:26:46.316 --> 00:26:51.017]  It just shows the mindless psychology of it.
[00:26:51.697 --> 00:26:57.738]  It just shows that this president, this vice president, is a complete moron.
[00:26:57.858 --> 00:27:01.259]  I mean, really, a complete and total moron.
[00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:01.979]  And then they took
[00:27:03.823 --> 00:27:13.149]  18 hours, I'll get more into it later, 18 hours to announce what happened to him and now we're getting conflicting stories in the head of the hospital saying he doesn't know the details of where the guy got hit.
[00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.932]  They had a chart 20 minutes after that guy was admitted and given an examination.
[00:27:18.572 --> 00:27:26.677]  Now, two days later plus, they know exactly where he got hit and have a chart where he's got every perforation point from those BBs.
[00:27:28.357 --> 00:27:32.443]  So they know what happened and they're lying about it and so things could be even worse.
[00:27:32.463 --> 00:27:37.451]  Well, what the White House is saying is that Dick Cheney turned around and shot behind him.
[00:27:38.467 --> 00:27:39.568]  I mean, that's the White House.
[00:27:39.588 --> 00:27:40.889]  That's what they've said.
[00:27:40.929 --> 00:27:42.971]  It says the Vice President's Office.
[00:27:43.011 --> 00:27:44.212]  We can't talk to the Chief of Staff.
[00:27:45.113 --> 00:27:48.656]  Libby's been indicted, but whoever the new Chief of Staff is, they're here.
[00:27:49.116 --> 00:27:56.482]  It says the Vice President's Office released a statement, and I guess we should say it's good he's not denying what he did.
[00:27:56.502 --> 00:27:58.864]  I mean, they probably should have lied about it.
[00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:06.751]  Maybe they think we're so dumb that we won't know what it means to shoot somebody with a shotgun in your hunting line who was behind you.
[00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:08.968]  Alright, I'm done.
[00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:09.988]  I'm done.
[00:28:10.008 --> 00:28:16.231]  That'd be like cops at the shooting range and if a cop turned around and shot somebody behind him, the opposite direction of the targets.
[00:28:18.392 --> 00:28:22.674]  I mean, it's one thing, you know, let's see, I don't want to get off into gun safety.
[00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:36.740]  I've thought so much about making a gun safety video, not that I'm some expert on it, but compared to most I guess I am, but going out and hiring some local concealed carry permit folks and hiring a rifle expert and putting out a gun safety video.
[00:28:37.395 --> 00:28:50.702]  Because there's a lot of gun owners, a lot of hunters, a lot of people who have it for self-defense or for hunting, and obviously self-defense is paramount, hunting is secondary, who really need to be given a crash course in it, big time.
[00:28:51.243 --> 00:28:58.406]  In fact, a lot of you, and I don't believe the government should come in and restrict you, because they'll just restrict my right, but a lot of you are a walking menace.
[00:28:58.827 --> 00:29:00.187]  A lot of cops are a menace.
[00:29:00.267 --> 00:29:01.068]  A lot of police.
[00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:27.152]  have done the minimum amount of training to get certified or they fudge the numbers to get uh... certain uh... quote minority groups in and I'm not saying that blacks or women can't shoot it's just let's say they've got smaller numbers of those people and they're trying to fill slots they'll scrape the bottom of the barrel and I read these stories all the time where the gun just goes off and the cop shoots somebody twice in the back alright now I'm really starting to rant
[00:29:28.107 --> 00:29:31.268]  And frankly, statistically, more often, it's these women cops.
[00:29:31.648 --> 00:29:33.369]  And there's women out there that are better shots than I am.
[00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:38.950]  It's just that most of the women that are going to become cops, they're not doing it because they like guns or like to shoot.
[00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.291]  They're doing it because it's a job.
[00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:45.092]  And, sir, if you don't like guns and don't like to use them and don't know how to use them, you shouldn't be a cop!
[00:29:45.172 --> 00:29:46.553]  It's real simple, you idiots!
[00:29:47.233 --> 00:29:48.033]  You're dangerous!
[00:29:51.714 --> 00:29:52.594]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.094 --> 00:29:54.595]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:58.285]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.811]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?
[00:30:04.071 --> 00:30:09.994]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now, with the Total Transformation.
[00:30:10.174 --> 00:30:16.777]  The program that helps stop defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[00:30:17.037 --> 00:30:19.338]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[00:30:19.558 --> 00:30:20.919]  Your child will listen to you again.
[00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:21.779]  I guarantee it.
[00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:24.880]  Change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.581]  Call now.
[00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:27.181]  1-800-373-0402.
[00:30:27.201 --> 00:30:27.441]  1-800-373-0402.
[00:30:28.422 --> 00:30:38.705]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[00:30:38.946 --> 00:30:40.246]  We got immediate results.
[00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:42.847]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[00:30:43.287 --> 00:30:51.570]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.
[00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.131]  Your child will listen to you again.
[00:30:56.436 --> 00:31:03.338]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.458 --> 00:31:07.599]  You know, Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:10.579]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:17.341]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:20.563]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.763 --> 00:31:23.144]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.304 --> 00:31:33.430]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:42.778]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.918 --> 00:31:50.525]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:50.585 --> 00:31:50.845]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:50.925 --> 00:31:52.306]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:32:01.246 --> 00:32:05.294]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.514 --> 00:32:08.921]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:12.548]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:16.062]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.102 --> 00:32:21.566]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:31.233]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:32:31.354 --> 00:32:32.735]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:38.159]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function instead on
[00:32:38.542 --> 00:32:43.086]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:43.166 --> 00:32:44.528]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.688 --> 00:32:48.572]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.612 --> 00:32:49.452]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:04.176 --> 00:33:10.201]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:13.783]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.405 --> 00:33:25.713]  Alright, I'm going to plug some books and videos and we'll go to Jake and Randy and Travis and Mark and Catherine and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:31.137]  Then I'll get into the Iran situation and where the Patriot Act's at right now and a lot more.
[00:33:32.245 --> 00:33:39.709]  Let me just elaborate on what I was saying earlier about, let's say a police department is wanting more women officers.
[00:33:39.749 --> 00:33:43.771]  They're getting sued by the federal government for not reaching their quota.
[00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:47.593]  Their problem is that women aren't going in and applying.
[00:33:47.653 --> 00:33:49.314]  And I've seen these reports in the news.
[00:33:49.634 --> 00:33:54.797]  So they'll put up billboards all over town saying, women, come in, try to get on the force.
[00:33:55.524 --> 00:34:03.710]  And then the women that do come sign up, it's such a small number that normally the police department could throw out or kick out or refuse.
[00:34:05.731 --> 00:34:19.400]  Let's say the large number of white males, black males, or Hispanic males they had to choose from, but let's say with women, this has actually been reported on, they have a smaller group to pick from, so they have to pick from people who aren't as good.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.224]  I mean, I'm sure they could get great women cops if they had the same number of women coming in applying as they had men.
[00:34:26.548 --> 00:34:28.129]  It's the same thing with fighter pilots.
[00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:55.347]  All those reports of these women slamming into runways in the middle of the night, slamming into aircraft carrier decks during these high seas, statistically dying many, many times more often than men, it's because so few women go apply and try to get into the flight schools, try to get into the Navy fighter programs, and so the few that do, they tend to
[00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:01.755]  Basically go soft on him, and this has all come out, but then that just gets him killed.
[00:35:01.815 --> 00:35:02.957]  It's like George Bush.
[00:35:03.827 --> 00:35:09.171]  He finally washed up because they wouldn't put him in the plane anymore because he almost killed himself so many times.
[00:35:09.452 --> 00:35:16.937]  He was part of that Silver Spoon Squadron down in Houston during Vietnam, full of other congressmen's sons.
[00:35:17.078 --> 00:35:18.519]  It was just full of them.
[00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:21.221]  It was called the Silver Spoon Squadron.
[00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:24.103]  And it didn't matter if he wouldn't take a drug test.
[00:35:24.123 --> 00:35:26.845]  It didn't matter if he was almost crashing and dying every time he took off.
[00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:31.969]  At a certain point, they just said, look, you're washed up, but you can keep your wings.
[00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:33.210]  Just don't come back.
[00:35:34.338 --> 00:35:38.822]  So, now I've really digressed off into that whole subject.
[00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:40.864]  Let me just spend a few minutes on this.
[00:35:41.905 --> 00:35:45.008]  We have the Occultism Exposed Combo Special.
[00:35:45.448 --> 00:35:48.371]  Powerful tools to expose the secret societies that rule the world.
[00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:54.797]  Codex Magicka, the 600 plus page, 1,000 photos and documents and diagrams in it.
[00:35:55.746 --> 00:35:58.147]  And it's normally $35, it's the size of a phone book.
[00:35:58.527 --> 00:36:08.772]  And then my new film, The Order of Death DVD Combo, it comes also with the original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, updated for 2005 with a brand new Order of Death film.
[00:36:08.812 --> 00:36:11.293]  So, two films and Codex Magicka $45.95, normally $59.90.
[00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:11.793]  That's a $15 discount.
[00:36:16.412 --> 00:36:23.698]  We have the Red, White, and Blue DVD special, and that's Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, really three films in one, three hours long.
[00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:27.561]  9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, my classic 9-11 film, it's excellent.
[00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:31.264]  And then the new Dylan Avery loose change second edition.
[00:36:31.804 --> 00:36:32.444]  On DVD.
[00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:34.005]  Three DVDs.
[00:36:34.065 --> 00:36:35.125]  Normally $45.90.
[00:36:35.165 --> 00:36:37.045]  Right now $34.95.
[00:36:37.165 --> 00:36:39.566]  Normally, Martial Law is $24.95.
[00:36:40.506 --> 00:36:46.928]  So, for $10 more, you're getting two other films is basically what happens there.
[00:36:47.028 --> 00:36:47.688]  Great deal.
[00:36:48.188 --> 00:36:49.668]  We have a 9-1-1 book special.
[00:36:49.748 --> 00:36:50.288]  You saved $12 on.
[00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:50.668]  Normally $31.95.
[00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:50.869]  Now $19.95.
[00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:52.589]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, and Paul Watson's book.
[00:36:58.235 --> 00:36:58.736]  We're good to go.
[00:37:21.068 --> 00:37:23.009]  Uh, it's three pages of them.
[00:37:23.029 --> 00:37:23.549]  Let me see.
[00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:26.010]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 specials.
[00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.791]  Let me just write that on the top of this.
[00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:30.172]  There's 14 specials.
[00:37:30.312 --> 00:37:31.452]  And I just told you about three of them.
[00:37:36.161 --> 00:37:38.422]  And they're all up on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:38.462 --> 00:37:48.524]  Go peruse them, shop them, check them out, get my videos, make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes, air them on AXS TV, show them to your VFW Hall, put them on at your college, your high school.
[00:37:48.544 --> 00:37:49.304]  A lot of you are.
[00:37:49.364 --> 00:37:50.645]  It's having a huge effect.
[00:37:50.965 --> 00:37:54.005]  Go to InfoWars.com to get hard copies of all these books and videos.
[00:37:54.486 --> 00:37:57.166]  We're adding a couple new books or videos every week.
[00:37:57.666 --> 00:38:04.228]  Last week we are now offering two of Galen Ross's newest and best books, The Elite Dare Don't Let Us Tell the People
[00:38:05.081 --> 00:38:07.526]  And also, Elite Serial Killers.
[00:38:08.027 --> 00:38:10.732]  I kept saying JFK, RFK, MLK.
[00:38:10.933 --> 00:38:15.521]  It's of Lincoln, RFK, JFK, MLK.
[00:38:16.977 --> 00:38:19.840]  So, it's all up there.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.363]  We're carrying Joan Vion's Global Straightjacket book.

[00:38:42.541 --> 00:38:43.923]  You need to have that as well.

[00:38:56.633 --> 00:38:57.353]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:38:57.373 --> 00:38:58.934]  Or you can simply write to me.
[00:38:58.954 --> 00:39:01.175]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:20.485]  And by the way, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and see Loose Change 2, the second edition, up there.
[00:39:21.266 --> 00:39:37.260]  All 14 of my films, my weekly TV show, and every week an interview in studio with somebody like Tex Mars, or Galen Ross, or Celica Stillo, or On the Toll Roads, or Libertarian Candidate for President and now for Congress, Michael Bagnerig, X-Files star Dean Hagelin,
[00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:40.880]  We just started this a few months ago, and it's really popular.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:48.102]  Folks like it, and I like it too, because you can see behind the scenes, and we do two cameras shooting here, myself and the guest, and then edit it and add documents.
[00:39:48.382 --> 00:39:50.362]  That's on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[00:39:51.062 --> 00:39:56.904]  There's also my book, Paul Watson's book, in e-book format, a bunch of other films, all my best audio interviews.
[00:39:57.484 --> 00:39:58.624]  It's really ridiculous.
[00:39:58.644 --> 00:40:05.146]  There's two or three new interviews of audio up there a week, a TV show every week, an interview in studio every week.
[00:40:06.006 --> 00:40:12.968]  And then all that huge library of other material up there and new films routinely that were authorized to post.
[00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:19.930]  Like Pastor Ted Pike's videos on the hate laws and what's really happening in Israel.
[00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.091]  Those are up there.
[00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:22.611]  He was gracious enough to let us do that.
[00:40:24.512 --> 00:40:26.412]  So it's all there at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:40:26.653 --> 00:40:31.194]  And by the way, Galen Ross just authorized me to post some of his films and some of his interviews.
[00:40:32.437 --> 00:40:37.759]  So as soon as those come in in the mail, I'm going to be posting those for PrisonPlanet.TV members.
[00:40:37.819 --> 00:40:39.360]  So $0.15 a day.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.061]  There are monthly subscriptions $5.95.
[00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:44.922]  So for the cost of 3 or 4 cups of coffee, you get a month.
[00:40:45.282 --> 00:40:49.484]  You can download the videos, burn copies of all my films, give them to people.
[00:40:49.524 --> 00:40:50.584]  It's a great activist tool.
[00:40:50.664 --> 00:40:54.646]  Or get a yearly subscription and get 3 months free when you do that.
[00:40:54.726 --> 00:40:57.007]  But bottom line, $0.15 a day.
[00:40:57.227 --> 00:40:57.947]  Take advantage of it.
[00:40:57.987 --> 00:40:58.667]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:41:00.757 --> 00:41:01.317]  Let's do this.
[00:41:01.778 --> 00:41:05.439]  Let's go to your calls and then get into the news that I've mentioned about U.S.
[00:41:05.459 --> 00:41:08.541]  prepares military blitz against Iran's nuclear sites.
[00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:10.422]  Peaceful nuclear sites, I would add.
[00:41:10.862 --> 00:41:15.164]  The Patriot Act and more on Cheney shooting his buddy and a lot more.
[00:41:16.605 --> 00:41:20.126]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Jake in South Dakota.
[00:41:20.146 --> 00:41:20.847]  Thanks for holding.
[00:41:20.887 --> 00:41:21.227]  Welcome.
[00:41:21.687 --> 00:41:22.147]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:22.187 --> 00:41:22.607]  How are you?
[00:41:22.728 --> 00:41:23.068]  Good, sir.
[00:41:23.928 --> 00:41:27.750]  Well, I was just wondering if you knew what we were doing up here in South Dakota with the jail initiative.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.081]  It's the Judicial Accountability Initiative Law.
[00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:33.901]  And what it does, it takes their immunity away.
[00:41:34.381 --> 00:41:36.602]  I was actually just on a radio show this morning.
[00:41:37.322 --> 00:41:38.602]  Up here, they were discussing it.
[00:41:38.642 --> 00:41:42.183]  I drove home as fast as I could because the lady was just really getting under my skin.
[00:41:42.363 --> 00:41:43.804]  And they hung up on me.
[00:41:44.064 --> 00:41:46.504]  But what it does, every lawyer in this town doesn't want this.
[00:41:47.885 --> 00:41:49.885]  Every judge in this town is terrified of this.
[00:41:51.546 --> 00:41:55.827]  And what happened was a man named William Stegmeyer here in South Dakota
[00:41:57.022 --> 00:42:00.204]  I borrowed it from the author Ron Branson in California who wrote the law.
[00:42:00.544 --> 00:42:10.471]  He got all the autographs he needed for the petition to become a vote on November's ballot to be a constitutional amendment number 8 of Article 6, which is the Bill of Rights.
[00:42:10.531 --> 00:42:12.092]  I'm a paralegal student.
[00:42:12.933 --> 00:42:14.974]  Well, that's very exciting.
[00:42:14.994 --> 00:42:22.899]  You know, always in the past, the government officials, the authorities, were really just public servants, but they tell us to call them boss now.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.440]  Yes, a boss.
[00:42:24.712 --> 00:42:31.836]  And I have heard of that legislation, or that constitutional amendment, to where, now already they're really accountable.
[00:42:31.856 --> 00:42:41.001]  They don't have immunity like they claim, but it simply restates in the law that when they do something outside of the Constitution, they are not protected.
[00:42:42.181 --> 00:42:51.246]  It gets a special grand jury, and it says right here, those not eligible for grand jury are elected officials, members of the state bar, judges, prosecutors, law enforcement personnel.
[00:42:51.666 --> 00:42:53.047]  And also it says something about
[00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:57.779]  Well, here's an example.
[00:42:57.879 --> 00:42:59.260]  Who watches the Watchers?
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:09.308]  I have three articles today about the government dealing drugs, one out of Houston, with the air marshals being arrested now, and they're being real hush-hush about it, but allegedly bringing in masses of cocaine.
[00:43:09.348 --> 00:43:10.109]  Well, of course!
[00:43:10.649 --> 00:43:17.755]  It's not that all cops are criminals, it's that statistically, criminals in positions of power get away with more.
[00:43:18.724 --> 00:43:25.711]  I think that the courts are the street-level contact that the New World Order has with the average American, and I think that that's really where everything gets beat.
[00:43:25.831 --> 00:43:27.013]  I'm actually from a different state.
[00:43:27.053 --> 00:43:28.754]  I was run here because I was outspoken.
[00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:32.879]  Actually, you, Alex, are the reason that I now am not afraid to speak up anymore.
[00:43:32.959 --> 00:43:35.281]  I'm possibly running for an office out here.
[00:43:35.982 --> 00:43:40.927]  I'm not quite done with school yet, but people say that I have a way with taking in a crowd and
[00:43:41.465 --> 00:43:42.346]  Converting the way they think.
[00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:42.887]  And it was you!
[00:43:42.907 --> 00:43:44.829]  I just discovered you about six months ago.
[00:43:44.849 --> 00:43:46.090]  Um, never heard of you.
[00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:46.751]  I've been in the movement.
[00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:47.932]  Got run out of Minnesota.
[00:43:48.252 --> 00:43:48.573]  Beaten.
[00:43:48.653 --> 00:43:49.514]  Tortured.
[00:43:49.754 --> 00:43:50.975]  I'm a victim of domestic spying.
[00:43:51.055 --> 00:43:54.899]  In November and December of 2001, I was spied on by FBI agents.
[00:43:54.959 --> 00:43:58.283]  I still have the tape recordings of them knowing where I was at.
[00:43:59.144 --> 00:43:59.724]  When nobody knew.
[00:43:59.744 --> 00:44:01.066]  Like, nobody should have known I was there.
[00:44:01.887 --> 00:44:02.807]  This thing has not been going on.
[00:44:02.827 --> 00:44:03.668]  I was a victim of torture.
[00:44:03.688 --> 00:44:05.328]  I was tortured in my home state of Minnesota.
[00:44:05.348 --> 00:44:06.008]  That's why I'm here.
[00:44:06.428 --> 00:44:10.970]  Well, that's the thing, is that when some foreigner gets tortured and it's terrible, it gets top news.
[00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:16.431]  But all the time, every day I see articles where in prisons they're raping, torturing people.
[00:44:16.831 --> 00:44:18.492]  I mean, who watches the watchers?
[00:44:19.332 --> 00:44:20.552]  Who keeps them in line?
[00:44:20.592 --> 00:44:23.213]  Well, throughout history, no one watches the watchers.
[00:44:23.233 --> 00:44:25.313]  They become very abusive in almost every case.
[00:44:25.593 --> 00:44:26.674]  And it's called despotism.
[00:44:26.734 --> 00:44:27.494]  It's called tyranny.
[00:44:28.141 --> 00:44:28.701]  It's happening.
[00:44:28.922 --> 00:44:30.042]  We need to get control of this.
[00:44:30.062 --> 00:44:30.702]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:30.722 --> 00:44:32.103]  Good to hear from you, Jake.
[00:44:32.804 --> 00:44:34.985]  Let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Illinois.
[00:44:35.045 --> 00:44:35.745]  Randy, welcome.
[00:44:36.005 --> 00:44:37.006]  Hey, hey Alex.
[00:44:37.026 --> 00:44:37.746]  How you doing today?
[00:44:37.766 --> 00:44:37.986]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:38.327 --> 00:44:38.967]  Great, great.
[00:44:39.007 --> 00:44:40.588]  Hey, I talked to you a couple weeks ago.
[00:44:40.808 --> 00:44:49.993]  It's just amazing what gets to me is when you try to explain to your friends what's going on and they say you keep changing subjects because there's just so many tentacles to this.
[00:44:50.093 --> 00:44:51.774]  It just is mind-boggling.
[00:44:52.174 --> 00:44:54.695]  The toll roads in Indiana are a big thing right now.
[00:44:54.735 --> 00:44:55.636]  They just signed on
[00:44:56.158 --> 00:44:59.820]  With an Australian and Spanish company, and I'm... It's the same company.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.601]  That's what I tell them.
[00:45:02.001 --> 00:45:05.202]  I tell my friends, I say, you know, I listen to this guy down in Texas.
[00:45:05.503 --> 00:45:10.905]  They've got the same deal going on there, and they've just leased it for 75 years, like in Kansas.
[00:45:10.925 --> 00:45:12.326]  There's no way to get off of it.
[00:45:12.822 --> 00:45:13.522]  You're on it.
[00:45:13.843 --> 00:45:15.744]  Any services you need are in the middle of it.
[00:45:15.764 --> 00:45:18.886]  Well, they're taking existing roads and slapping tolls on it.
[00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:23.068]  Yes, exactly, and it's all to build another one down south is why they're doing it.
[00:45:23.229 --> 00:45:25.450]  Now, I'm familiar with the Indiana situation.
[00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:31.694]  I heard a guest on the network, a state rep from there in Indiana, decrying it a few weeks ago, but they did sign that?
[00:45:32.245 --> 00:45:32.965]  Yes, they did.
[00:45:33.045 --> 00:45:34.266]  It's a done deal now.
[00:45:34.306 --> 00:45:35.206]  Must have just happened then.
[00:45:35.286 --> 00:45:36.747]  Yes, just like in the last week.
[00:45:36.827 --> 00:45:38.568]  It's just so crazy what's going on.
[00:45:38.668 --> 00:45:41.049]  I love the Omer Fudd reference about Cheney, too.
[00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:49.672]  I was thinking the Arlo Guthrie, Alice's Restaurant reference of him jumping up and down, yelling, kill, kill, and they come in and pin a medal on him and say, you're our boy.
[00:45:49.912 --> 00:45:51.393]  Well, it's like Yosemite Sam.
[00:45:52.636 --> 00:45:55.680]  That's the worst hunting ethics I've ever heard.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:01.226]  Where the bird flies over you, you just turn around with no impulse control and shoot behind you.
[00:46:01.586 --> 00:46:03.788]  A couple other things I was wanting to ask you about.
[00:46:03.828 --> 00:46:07.012]  What happened with the cop who shot the guy laying on the ground?
[00:46:07.072 --> 00:46:10.916]  I mean, that was a really weird deal because the guy seemed to be a little mouthy.
[00:46:10.956 --> 00:46:12.337]  The guy ended up shooting him.
[00:46:12.477 --> 00:46:13.719]  What's ever happened with that?
[00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:16.831]  The one that was caught on videotape.
[00:46:16.851 --> 00:46:18.171]  Are you talking about in Austin?
[00:46:19.272 --> 00:46:22.093]  No, you're talking about the case in Tennessee?
[00:46:22.333 --> 00:46:23.313]  Yeah, I forget it.
[00:46:23.374 --> 00:46:27.976]  Yeah, I believe it was maybe like Memphis where the guy was going, hey man, I just got back from Iraq.
[00:46:28.616 --> 00:46:31.997]  Well, yeah, there have been so many cases of that.
[00:46:32.217 --> 00:46:37.820]  There's video of the dog, the lab runs up wagging its tail, and the cop thinks it's an Al-Qaeda operative attacking him.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.643]  You know, the dog's wagging its tail as he guns it down.
[00:46:40.703 --> 00:46:49.352]  I mean, that's the point is you get a bunch of souped up steroid heads who grew up as latchkey kids playing violent video games.
[00:46:49.372 --> 00:46:59.504]  They go have a tour in Iraq, they come back, they slap sergeant bars on their arms and send them out to be cops and they think they're fighting Al-Qaeda when they pull old ladies over.
[00:46:59.872 --> 00:47:04.662]  That's the exact point I had with Derry Brownfield, the show on Before You.
[00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:10.534]  He was talking about how could they end up shooting like this, like Dick Cheney doing it, and it's because they come home...
[00:47:11.654 --> 00:47:17.797]  He was talking about how he saw kids waving guns around when they have even like a BB guns, because they do come home and play these video games.
[00:47:18.097 --> 00:47:20.938]  They don't realize there is a consequence to what they're doing.
[00:47:21.498 --> 00:47:24.440]  What's going on down south in Texas in the Mexican border?
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.101]  I saw it got some play on Primetime Live.
[00:47:27.721 --> 00:47:30.823]  Yeah, I need folks to take those newscasts and mail them to me.
[00:47:30.843 --> 00:47:31.903]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:32.543 --> 00:47:36.065]  I was in a hotel one night last week as we were having some work done on our house.
[00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:40.727]  Some paintings, so couldn't sleep in the house because of paint fumes.
[00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:46.538]  But to make a long story short, I was watching television and I saw local newscast.
[00:47:46.618 --> 00:47:47.220]  I think it was ABC.
[00:47:49.036 --> 00:47:50.137]  And it was unbelievable!
[00:47:50.177 --> 00:48:06.544]  A five-minute detailed report about the bombings and the shootings and the hundreds dead and burning buildings and the borders shutting down and now it's a war zone and Rick Perry says Bush isn't doing enough, but Rick Perry's sending a hundred cops.
[00:48:07.144 --> 00:48:09.065]  I mean, try a thousand.
[00:48:09.325 --> 00:48:10.405]  It wouldn't do anything.
[00:48:10.846 --> 00:48:13.307]  There are thousands and thousands of Mexican troops.
[00:48:13.327 --> 00:48:18.509]  And they had photo and video of the Mexican troops taken by police up close aiming guns at cops.
[00:48:19.318 --> 00:48:25.020]  Imagine, Mexican troops just come across and aim machine guns at our police and take cocaine back from them they've seized.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.941]  And I don't want to hear it's people dressed up like Mexican troops.
[00:48:31.282 --> 00:48:39.404]  I was just down in Mexico a while back, down right on the Guatemala border, driving around on a tour bus.
[00:48:40.283 --> 00:49:06.919]  and uh... in costa maya near costa maya and there were big marijuana fields with army jeeps with machine guns protecting them and you'd come to a checkpoint and the mexican troops would search you and the tour guide's like we don't live in a police state no they're just checking for drugs yeah checking for other people's drugs and then guarding their own drugs meanwhile though the cops aren't worried about that they'll pull me and my family over and demand to search my car because
[00:49:08.419 --> 00:49:13.302]  Because, you know, 9-11 and things have changed, but the borders are wide open and we've got narco-terrorists running around.
[00:49:13.322 --> 00:49:15.344]  Let me tell you something.
[00:49:15.364 --> 00:49:19.307]  The Los Zetas gangs, the military gangs, work for the U.S.
[00:49:19.327 --> 00:49:19.647]  government.
[00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:22.109]  That's been proven.
[00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:26.752]  They're the actual narco-terrorist arm muscling the competition.
[00:49:26.792 --> 00:49:28.473]  We now have death squads in Texas.
[00:49:28.853 --> 00:49:32.656]  The guy that ran death squads is the head of, quote, all intelligence, John Negroponte.
[00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.338]  Sounds crazy, but it's true.
[00:49:36.921 --> 00:49:43.968]  And, uh, I mean, what, in one night a few months ago in Arizona, like 20 houses got burned down and tractors got blown up.
[00:49:44.028 --> 00:49:48.532]  I mean, it was just fires everywhere with the plan of San Diego being carried out.
[00:49:48.573 --> 00:49:50.975]  You don't know what the plan of San Diego is, just type it into Google.
[00:49:52.722 --> 00:49:54.223]  That's the race war, folks.
[00:49:54.243 --> 00:49:58.968]  And of course, most Hispanics aren't part of it and think it's horrible, but it's what's being pushed by these governments.
[00:49:59.688 --> 00:50:10.958]  And it'll degenerate and fall apart, and then it'll just be a police state down there, so our government can oversee the orderly movement of the illegal aliens into the country under the amnesty plan.
[00:50:11.879 --> 00:50:12.719]  And that's all it is.
[00:50:14.201 --> 00:50:15.482]  That's all it is.
[00:50:15.542 --> 00:50:17.744]  And yes, it is now getting some national play.
[00:50:18.827 --> 00:50:22.670]  Finally, and I was watching that news report and I said, it sounds like me!
[00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:27.874]  Total bedlam, war zone, bombs, car bombs, murders all over the state.
[00:50:28.314 --> 00:50:31.416]  Murders from Dallas to Brownsville.
[00:50:31.956 --> 00:50:33.117]  State of emergency.
[00:50:33.517 --> 00:50:35.559]  State Department says don't travel in the area.
[00:50:35.579 --> 00:50:37.560]  I'm like, thank goodness.
[00:50:38.621 --> 00:50:42.063]  You know, I even got heat last year for reporting on it.
[00:50:42.284 --> 00:50:42.624]  Remember?
[00:50:44.469 --> 00:50:49.050]  Even some of the immigration websites are like, Alex Jones gets a little upset.
[00:50:49.691 --> 00:50:52.091]  It's not as bad as he's... What are you talking about?
[00:50:52.271 --> 00:50:53.072]  800 dead?
[00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:56.693]  More dangerous than Iraq per capita?
[00:51:02.873 --> 00:51:05.715]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:07.556]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.896 --> 00:51:12.579]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:19.664]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.984 --> 00:51:21.966]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:25.008]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:29.773]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.973 --> 00:51:34.377]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.617 --> 00:51:41.843]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.103 --> 00:51:44.525]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:07.455]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:07.595 --> 00:52:15.684]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.944 --> 00:52:22.991]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:23.131 --> 00:52:24.092]  We're good to go!

[00:53:03.371 --> 00:53:03.691]  I think so.
[00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:19.259]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.112 --> 00:53:51.214]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.374 --> 00:53:57.477]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.221]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:09.123]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.864 --> 00:54:13.526]  Let me try to crystallize what's happening on the southwestern border.
[00:54:13.546 --> 00:54:15.747]  Predominantly Texas, Arizona, but Texas is the worst.
[00:54:17.293 --> 00:54:26.477]  The CIA, intelligence agencies, the military, stirs up the problem, trains the death squads to go after drug dealers that aren't part of the multinational conglomerates.
[00:54:27.257 --> 00:54:32.599]  Then the people see the big crisis and the government uses it to turn the southern part of the state into a police state.
[00:54:33.817 --> 00:54:34.237]  How you doing?
[00:54:34.317 --> 00:54:34.837]  Excellent.
[00:55:02.389 --> 00:55:07.613]  First, I'd just like to commend your efforts in combating the New World Order.
[00:55:07.653 --> 00:55:11.155]  You're the man, you're a lion, and that's exactly what we have to be in order to win this war.
[00:55:11.216 --> 00:55:13.677]  I'm just an average person, telling it like I see it, brother.
[00:55:13.697 --> 00:55:14.398]  Yeah.
[00:55:14.898 --> 00:55:21.183]  Well, concerning the Dick Cheney issue from this weekend, I think that his actions were pretty irresponsible and ridiculous.
[00:55:21.203 --> 00:55:23.765]  Well, not pretty irresponsible, it's totally insane.
[00:55:24.165 --> 00:55:24.465]  Yeah.
[00:55:24.906 --> 00:55:27.387]  In fact, it was reckless endangerment.
[00:55:27.888 --> 00:55:30.810]  It was just unbelievable.
[00:55:31.519 --> 00:55:32.259]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:39.063]  My family owns a ranch here in South Texas and the most important thing that we stress is weapon safety.
[00:55:39.604 --> 00:55:47.729]  We lease the land to hunters to come and hunt and that's the most important thing is being safe with a weapon.
[00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:58.895]  And if your family or your ranch manager sees bird hunters firing behind them towards other hunters, what would happen?
[00:55:59.616 --> 00:56:00.196]  Oh, they'd be gone.
[00:56:00.799 --> 00:56:01.339]  Just like that.
[00:56:01.399 --> 00:56:07.081]  It's actually my father that does all the managing of it and he would not tolerate it.
[00:56:07.121 --> 00:56:08.522]  It would be completely unacceptable.
[00:56:09.162 --> 00:56:10.483]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:56:10.523 --> 00:56:16.305]  But that's 101 that a lot of idiots who break safety rules still don't do that.
[00:56:16.605 --> 00:56:21.687]  The birds fly over you, you don't rotate behind yourself and shoot back towards the other hunters.
[00:56:22.267 --> 00:56:24.047]  No, that's not acceptable.
[00:56:25.973 --> 00:56:28.315]  You can kill somebody, blow somebody's head off, just like you said.
[00:56:28.575 --> 00:56:30.337]  It's not a good thing.
[00:56:30.517 --> 00:56:32.078]  It's 101.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.441]  It's pre-school.
[00:56:35.681 --> 00:56:37.282]  Very basic gun safety rules.
[00:56:38.704 --> 00:56:43.828]  Obviously, I don't know if he's had to take the course himself, probably not, considering who he is.
[00:56:44.471 --> 00:56:46.773]  But, you know, he could probably... They're not looking into that.
[00:56:46.793 --> 00:56:50.336]  It looks like anybody who's got one of those licenses now, you've got to have the course.
[00:56:50.376 --> 00:56:52.638]  And it looks like Lord Cheney broke the law.
[00:56:52.698 --> 00:56:59.783]  It's like Schwarzenegger not having a motorcycle license and wrecking... But again, he doesn't get prosecuted.
[00:56:59.843 --> 00:57:03.326]  We all get prosecuted, but not them, because they're the officials.
[00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.148]  Yeah, they're above the law, right?
[00:57:05.268 --> 00:57:09.731]  They don't have to follow the rules that the rest of us have to follow.
[00:57:09.751 --> 00:57:10.692]  They make them, right?
[00:57:11.973 --> 00:57:13.034]  That's exactly what they do.
[00:57:13.737 --> 00:57:17.599]  Yeah, I also had a kind of interesting story that I thought that you would like.
[00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:29.803]  A friend of mine recently was thinking about joining the Army, and I kind of introduced him to some of your material and to the whole idea of the New World Order and what was really going on.
[00:57:30.524 --> 00:57:37.907]  And he went to the recruiter's office and he started asking them questions about, you know, about these kind of things.
[00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:41.168]  Nothing specific to the New World Order, but he wanted to know about
[00:57:42.052 --> 00:58:06.619]  uh... you want to know about the the torture going on in Guantanamo Bay and they told him straight to his face first off they did not deny anything that he said and then they told him straight to his face that that was just something that he was going to have to do if he joined the army torture was just something he was going to have to do if he joined up it was just you know like it was commonplace now you know like
[00:58:07.435 --> 00:58:10.819]  Well, two recruiters followed him all the way home and they showed up the next day
[00:58:31.154 --> 00:58:35.657]  Looking for him at his school, and he avoided them.
[00:58:35.697 --> 00:58:36.958]  He didn't talk to them.
[00:58:37.098 --> 00:58:37.498]  Stay there.
[00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:39.960]  I want to let you briefly finish up when we start the second hour.
[00:58:41.461 --> 00:58:46.044]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.015 --> 00:58:58.656]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.316 --> 00:59:00.377]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.098 --> 00:59:02.199]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:03.660]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:05.341]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.982 --> 00:59:09.805]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.165 --> 00:59:14.249]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:27.206]  Alright, now into the second hour already on this 13th day of February 2006.
[00:59:27.246 --> 00:59:28.268]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:36.409]  Continuing with Open Phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:36.749 --> 00:59:37.710]  We're going to get into U.S.
[00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:40.472]  Preparer's military blitz against Iran's nuclear sites.
[00:59:40.912 --> 00:59:47.917]  Also, Hastert saying they've got a deal on the expansion of the USA Patriot Act, and a lot more.
[00:59:47.997 --> 00:59:51.019]  Now, Mainstream News is discussing, is Bush a dictator, and is that good?
[00:59:51.419 --> 00:59:52.560]  It's kind of like, maybe he is.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.621]  Maybe that's freedom.
[00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:55.763]  Maybe that's what America is all about.
[00:59:55.803 --> 00:59:57.664]  The Constitution says he's a dictator.
[00:59:58.858 --> 00:59:59.879]  No, it says the opposite.
[00:59:59.899 --> 01:00:01.140]  But hey, c'est la vie!
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.901]  Let's go back to Travis in Texas.
[01:00:05.242 --> 01:00:07.644]  He was bringing up a friend.
[01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:16.254]  I believe we're talking to Travis, who went to the Army recruiters and they said, yeah, torture is just what we do and you'll have to get used to it.
[01:00:16.274 --> 01:00:20.257]  Then they were following him around and stuff to school and home after he'd visited them.
[01:00:20.277 --> 01:00:26.180]  And that was in the Houston papers and on TV, where the guy that said, we'll arrest you if you don't sign up with us.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.661]  It's the federal law.
[01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:29.662]  That guy actually got promoted.
[01:00:30.443 --> 01:00:32.204]  But go ahead and finish up what you were saying, Travis.
[01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.545]  That was pretty much it.
[01:00:35.846 --> 01:00:38.267]  He's kind of
[01:00:39.613 --> 01:00:47.597]  He stayed away from the recruitment since all this happened and he's gotten really paranoid because, well obviously.
[01:00:48.298 --> 01:01:02.786]  One of the things I thought was kind of strange though is that the day that they came looking for him at his school, and he left school that day because he knew that they were looking for him.
[01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:04.027]  He didn't want to go, obviously.
[01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:05.588]  He was frightened.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:19.010]  He called his mother to ask her if everything was alright at his house, and she said that some individuals from the army had driven by the house.
[01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:24.896]  And then, later on that night, he talked to her about it again, and she changed her story.
[01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:27.118]  She just said, oh no, nobody came by.
[01:01:28.294 --> 01:01:32.457]  And I thought that that, in and of itself, was very peculiar.
[01:01:32.537 --> 01:01:35.318]  Well, I mean, they muscle these young people.
[01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.059]  They push them.
[01:01:36.099 --> 01:01:41.702]  They now are having offices in the schools, and they follow each grade.
[01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:55.851]  It's like two army recruiters will be nested with a group of kids in the eighth grade, and then they will move to the first year of high school, then sophomore, then junior, then senior, and will follow them, quote, creating relationships.
[01:01:56.371 --> 01:01:57.072]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:57.627 --> 01:01:58.129]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:01:58.289 --> 01:01:58.731]  You bet.
[01:01:59.454 --> 01:02:01.241]  And, uh, it's just horrible.
[01:02:02.182 --> 01:02:23.648]  I mean, who wants our kids to join the military so they can go be shattered by a IED, improvised explosive device, and then the government will charge them for their shattered body armor, $700, and charge them for a plane ticket home, and charge them $4 a day for their meals in the hospital with their arms and legs blown off, and that's how you support the troops!
[01:02:24.008 --> 01:02:25.928]  And if you're not for treating them bad, you don't support them.
[01:02:26.169 --> 01:02:27.429]  Treating them bad is supporting them.
[01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:29.649]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark.
[01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.310]  Mark, where are you calling us from?
[01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:32.933]  Mark hung up.
[01:02:33.013 --> 01:02:34.394]  Okay, Catherine in Florida.
[01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:35.674]  Catherine, go ahead.
[01:02:35.694 --> 01:02:39.676]  Hey, my name is Catherine Koston, C-O-S-S-O-N.
[01:02:40.136 --> 01:02:45.037]  I am an author of The Red Sands of Aliquop, The True Love Story by Catherine Koston.
[01:02:45.558 --> 01:02:46.578]  Okay, very nice.
[01:02:46.998 --> 01:02:50.959]  And is there any way... Yes, ma'am?
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.120]  Mark, do you have something about my book?
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.441]  Yes, we're on air right now.
[01:02:54.461 --> 01:02:56.281]  Oh, okay, great.
[01:02:56.301 --> 01:02:57.182]  What is your book about?
[01:02:57.202 --> 01:02:58.122]  My book is...
[01:02:59.366 --> 01:03:05.427]  Uh, being tortured and into violence, being here in Aliquaf, Florida near the Phoenix Springs.
[01:03:05.488 --> 01:03:06.708]  I was raised up there.
[01:03:07.028 --> 01:03:08.728]  When I was a little girl, I was tortured.
[01:03:08.748 --> 01:03:10.089]  Well, I'll tell you what you do.
[01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:13.950]  Why don't you mail me a copy of your book so I can look at it to review it.
[01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.130]  Why don't you mail me a copy of your book?
[01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:19.951]  Can I get, I'll tell you what, I'll put you on hold and we'll give you my address, Catherine.
[01:03:20.765 --> 01:03:23.727]  And when we come back, we'll talk to Jason and Ray and many others.

[01:03:25.488 --> 01:03:26.169]  I'm going to do this.
[01:03:26.189 --> 01:03:27.510]  I'm going to get into Iran.
[01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:35.326]  And the Patriot Act expansion and Bush being a dictator first.
[01:03:35.906 --> 01:03:36.847]  Then we'll go to your calls.
[01:03:36.867 --> 01:03:37.067]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:37.087 --> 01:03:38.267]  Wide open phones today.
[01:03:38.287 --> 01:03:38.347]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:39.488]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03:39.508 --> 01:03:41.729]  Websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.283]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:58.524]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.664 --> 01:04:02.566]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:06.847]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:07.187 --> 01:04:10.968]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:11.088 --> 01:04:13.029]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.089 --> 01:04:16.590]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:17.530]  Medical bills!
[01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:21.171]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:24.352]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:27.413]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.893 --> 01:04:33.995]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.535 --> 01:04:38.338]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:38.738 --> 01:04:40.119]  Order your video today.
[01:04:40.439 --> 01:04:41.500]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:58.955]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.315 --> 01:05:03.399]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:04.240]  We listened.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.544]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:10.305]  We listened.
[01:05:10.685 --> 01:05:13.728]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.148 --> 01:05:14.649]  We listened.
[01:05:15.129 --> 01:05:19.190]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:20.070]  We listened.
[01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:25.631]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:27.431]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:27.771 --> 01:05:35.153]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:06:42.978 --> 01:06:46.780]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.423]  Wide open phones today at 800-259-9231.
[01:07:09.543 --> 01:07:15.007]  We've had a lot of guests on Lateland today for covering the news and taking your calls.
[01:07:15.928 --> 01:07:18.370]  Let me jump back into the news first though.
[01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:25.656]  It's very confusing for someone who watches just mainstream television news who's trying to get their news.
[01:07:25.676 --> 01:07:29.640]  You hear that they just want to quote reauthorize, repass,
[01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:36.781]  The Patriot Act that sunsetted late last year and they've been passing one month extensions.
[01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:40.083]  And it has basically now expired again.
[01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:43.885]  But Bush said he doesn't care if it expires.
[01:07:44.325 --> 01:07:49.128]  He's just going to order the executive branch that basically runs this country now, or top-heavy.
[01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:53.651]  Supposed to have a separation of power between the three branches of government to stop dictatorship.
[01:07:54.275 --> 01:08:00.457]  But Bush now says the Constitution says he has dictatorial powers to keep us safe from the terrorists, of course.
[01:08:01.317 --> 01:08:03.978]  And he doesn't care if it's reauthorized.
[01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:10.419]  Well, then why does he want to pass it, then, if he has these powers to just announce out of his mouth what the law is?
[01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:15.621]  Well, what he wants is to radically expand Patriot Act.
[01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:17.041]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:31.219]  There is a writer that has been added to the piece of legislation by the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Arlen, Magic Bullet, Warren Commission, Specter.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.022]  And I'm going to tell you what's in that piece of legislation.
[01:08:35.824 --> 01:08:38.006]  Or in that little sliver of pork barrel.
[01:08:38.286 --> 01:08:43.031]  It says that anyone, and we covered this on the show last week, anyone who quote disrupts
[01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:52.381]  Any national security event will be charged as a felon and spend at least one year in prison.
[01:08:59.764 --> 01:09:28.656]  Pretorian Guard the Secret Service into a national police force because right now they have very limited roles for the Treasury Department over counterfeiting and then protecting dignitaries and the president and the vice president and their families and former presidents but in the bill it says they will be over fighting all crime in the United States that affects the infrastructure
[01:09:29.646 --> 01:09:40.391]  And that they will also be able to declare any area of a city or a town permanently, or for a long period of time, short period of time, whatever they want to do.
[01:09:40.411 --> 01:09:41.251]  It's open-ended.
[01:09:41.631 --> 01:09:43.232]  It's broad new powers.
[01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:52.456]  And that they are now a national police force, and that even if a, quote, public official or a protected person
[01:09:53.821 --> 01:10:22.383]  is not in the area or at the event they can on the spot uh... disband protest block protest even permitted protest and anyone who they think is quote causing any type of disturbance will then go to prison so they are a national police force with snatch-and-grab soviet style powers that's exactly what they are and that's exactly what they're doing
[01:10:23.755 --> 01:10:35.582]  And in the last few years, whenever Bush goes to Memphis, Tennessee, or Dallas, Texas, or Charlotte, North Carolina, these are just some of the cases we've covered and we've had guests on from these instances.
[01:10:37.664 --> 01:10:51.472]  One case was there across the street from the federal courthouse in Memphis, a conservative Vietnam veteran, we had on last year, actually it was in late 2004, it was during the election, excuse me, over a year ago now,
[01:10:53.679 --> 01:11:02.644]  He was actually a Republican, and he had a coffee shop that he set on air that cops mainly frequented, and federal officers.
[01:11:03.524 --> 01:11:06.826]  So he certainly isn't even anti-government, as you could say.
[01:11:07.966 --> 01:11:09.187]  And he got a phone call.
[01:11:09.227 --> 01:11:10.307]  This is a secret service.
[01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:22.033]  Make sure there are no signs, especially anti-Bush signs, up in your storefront window coming up next week when President Bush is coming into town and having a campaign parade.
[01:11:22.998 --> 01:11:23.818]  Down your street.
[01:11:25.079 --> 01:11:26.579]  And the fellow said, well, wait a minute.
[01:11:26.599 --> 01:11:27.459]  This is a free country.
[01:11:27.519 --> 01:11:28.320]  I'm a Vietnam veteran.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.180]  I fought for this country.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.600]  I know what the First Amendment says.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:38.783]  By the way, I've been pro-Bush, but I'm going to put a sign up saying that you called and told me I didn't have a First Amendment.
[01:11:38.823 --> 01:11:40.343]  And they said, well, you may be arrested then.
[01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:41.083]  He said, fine.
[01:11:41.403 --> 01:11:42.424]  And he put the sign up.
[01:11:43.584 --> 01:11:44.984]  Then he talked to his neighbors.
[01:11:45.044 --> 01:11:47.025]  They all got the same phone call.
[01:11:47.822 --> 01:11:51.765]  And since then, it's been all over the news that this happens.
[01:11:51.825 --> 01:11:58.150]  They just call up and anything embarrassing to El Jefe, the President, is to be removed.
[01:11:59.251 --> 01:12:00.272]  And they're really doing this.
[01:12:00.753 --> 01:12:01.653]  There are so many cases.
[01:12:01.673 --> 01:12:13.503]  We're going to have 3,000 Bush supporters and 20 anti-Bush people, or 500 Bush supporters, and one guy, one professor with a no-blood-for-oil sign in Secret Service walks right up to the cops in North Carolina and says, arrest him.
[01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:15.930]  And the cops say, no, he has a First Amendment.
[01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:18.973]  And they go, listen, national security event, we're ordering you to.
[01:12:19.013 --> 01:12:20.134]  So the cops arrest him.
[01:12:20.494 --> 01:12:24.357]  He's federally charged and he spends six months in jail of a year sentence.
[01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:29.120]  So they're already implementing this before they even pass a law using other laws.
[01:12:32.063 --> 01:12:34.745]  And there are so many examples of this.
[01:12:35.405 --> 01:12:40.349]  Nothing to do with Al Qaeda, nothing to do with fighting terrorism, everything to do with having a chilling effect.
[01:12:41.893 --> 01:12:47.055]  On the First Amendment, because the establishment is afraid of your free speech and your activism.
[01:12:48.515 --> 01:12:52.216]  But by the time it gets to the newspaper, this is the information we get out of the Associated Press.
[01:12:52.556 --> 01:13:03.079]  Hastert, that's the gentleman that even Vanity Fair and the major publications like the Village Voice have reported, took a bunch of illegal cashola from Abramoff, but that's okay.
[01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:07.522]  Hastert backs a deal on USA Patriot Act.
[01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:18.651]  House Speaker Dennis Hastert embraced a deal reached by a group of Senate Republicans in a White House to renew the USA Patriot Act, a centerpiece of President Bush's war on terrorism.
[01:13:19.474 --> 01:13:23.156]  This happened Friday, minutes after there was a nerve gas detected.
[01:13:23.176 --> 01:13:26.278]  Turned out it was a false alarm, but that sure got him in line quickly.
[01:13:26.298 --> 01:13:34.543]  Remember, the White House openly had a plan to mail weaponized anthrax to the mail, congressionally studied in 1999, then magically weaponized U.S.
[01:13:34.603 --> 01:13:39.426]  anthrax gets mailed to President Bush's enemies, including somebody that published photos of his drunken daughters.
[01:13:40.987 --> 01:13:43.209]  Hmm, but I'm sure this isn't connected to the White House.
[01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:45.110]  Hastert, an Illinois Republican,
[01:13:45.936 --> 01:13:53.303]  Said once the Senate passes the measure, likely this week, the House would give it final congressional approval so Bush can sign it into law.
[01:13:53.943 --> 01:13:59.888]  If the Senate passes it, will pass it, Hassard told reporters, at a retreat by House Republicans in Cambridge.
[01:14:00.409 --> 01:14:05.833]  The deal announced was designed to address demands for better protection of civil liberties.
[01:14:06.634 --> 01:14:09.136]  And they're going to do that by expanding it and destroying your rights.
[01:14:09.176 --> 01:14:09.957]  You've got to love it.
[01:14:10.945 --> 01:14:22.372]  The Patriot Act, initially enacted after September 11th attacks, that no one was allowed to read it by the way, expanded the power of federal law enforcement to conduct wiretaps and secret searches and share information.
[01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:32.978]  The pending legislation would make permanent 14 key provisions, now set to expire on March 10th and extend to others for four years.
[01:14:33.959 --> 01:14:40.383]  While some Senate Democrats portrayed the White House-backed deal as failing to address civil liberties concerns adequately,
[01:14:41.434 --> 01:14:46.899]  Several Senate Republicans and Democrats who had earlier balked at renewing the law now supported it.
[01:14:47.819 --> 01:14:58.868]  One charge and change would allow individuals to challenge gag orders when they have been subpoenaed to produce sensitive information on library, medical, education, or gun-related records.
[01:14:58.928 --> 01:14:59.909]  That's right, guns.
[01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:08.997]  Another would clarify that traditional libraries would not be subjected to special subpoenas which are not issued by judges to gain records.
[01:15:09.657 --> 01:15:20.707]  A group of Republican and Democratic Senators combined in December to stage a filibuster, a procedural move that blocked a vote on earlier House-passed measures to remove the Act.
[01:15:21.187 --> 01:15:25.150]  Since then, Congress approved two short-term extensions.
[01:15:25.551 --> 01:15:30.155]  It's time we get it done on a long-term basis, Hastert the Crook said.
[01:15:31.076 --> 01:15:34.839]  Now, let me comment on
[01:15:36.261 --> 01:15:44.464]  The provision here that they talk about, Section 213, 215, or two of the bad ones, they have provisions in there.
[01:15:44.484 --> 01:15:47.025]  I've written an analysis of H.R.
[01:15:47.045 --> 01:16:00.929]  3162 past October 27, 2001, and when they go to your bookstore, your library, your business, your private home, your corporation, it lists all of them, anything.
[01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:14.494]  They come and they say, we're subpoenaing all of your records, and you can't ever, in perpetuity, tell anyone that we were here, or that we've, quote, forced you to talk.
[01:16:14.534 --> 01:16:16.454]  You also, quote after quote, answer questions.
[01:16:16.494 --> 01:16:17.734]  No more Fifth Amendment.
[01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:28.637]  And it says you'll be charged as a terrorist if you tell anyone, including your lawyer, that you have been interrogated or had your records taken.
[01:16:29.554 --> 01:16:55.232]  It also says in section 213, known euphemistically as the sneak and peek, that they can break in your home, business, anything they wish, your company, and then not even tell you that they were there, they can leave things, not just remove items, but can plant things, and not just bugs, but quote information, and then if you discover it, they can then order you to not tell anyone that they broke into your home or office without a warrant.
[01:16:55.292 --> 01:16:57.894]  Now, we have all this big discussion about how the
[01:16:58.895 --> 01:17:06.759]  About how the NSA is spying on Bin Laden when he calls his buddies at the NSA, excuse me, when he calls his bosses at Al-Cieda.
[01:17:07.479 --> 01:17:24.248]  Meanwhile, the Pentagon's all over the news, but back of the paper, spying on peace groups, Second Amendment groups, land rights groups, the whole political spectrum, the entire political gamut, the entire political field, the penultimate panoptagon of information.
[01:17:24.588 --> 01:17:24.628]  A 360.
[01:17:24.668 --> 01:17:24.768]  Move.
[01:17:27.429 --> 01:17:29.610]  But here it is in 213 in your face.
[01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:31.350]  Why is there not a discussion of this?
[01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:35.231]  Breaking in American citizens' homes without warrants.
[01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:37.031]  And it says it in the Associated Press.
[01:17:37.171 --> 01:17:38.992]  Oh, there's moves to change that.
[01:17:39.552 --> 01:17:41.212]  But all it does is change the wording.
[01:17:41.292 --> 01:17:41.732]  I've read it.
[01:17:41.832 --> 01:17:43.013]  It does the exact same thing.
[01:17:43.193 --> 01:17:44.493]  They just change the wording.
[01:17:44.753 --> 01:17:47.153]  Just the words are different, but it does the exact same thing.
[01:17:50.071 --> 01:17:52.092]  We're going to break in your house without a warrant.
[01:17:52.612 --> 01:17:54.112]  It's these big rubber stamps.
[01:17:54.632 --> 01:18:03.515]  They're administrative subpoenas that the FBI or any other federal agency swears out themselves and they're sworn out for entire FBI regions.
[01:18:05.335 --> 01:18:06.656]  Entire states.
[01:18:07.056 --> 01:18:08.216]  Multi-state areas.
[01:18:09.056 --> 01:18:09.736]  In some cases.
[01:18:10.277 --> 01:18:11.697]  And it is not a warrant.
[01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.067]  And so there it is.
[01:18:14.567 --> 01:18:15.887]  Nothing to do with Al Qaeda.
[01:18:16.007 --> 01:18:17.648]  Thousands of times they've used it.
[01:18:18.368 --> 01:18:23.530]  You can just type in Patriot Act used in non-terror related cases into Google.
[01:18:24.130 --> 01:18:33.773]  And there are hundreds of articles, topless bars, pot dealers, civil disturbances, family violence, land rights, just homeless.
[01:18:34.818 --> 01:18:39.601]  We have hundreds of articles on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and archives on that subject.
[01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:45.025]  We've written probably, I don't know, it's got to be dozens of them, just a whole bunch about this subject.
[01:18:45.065 --> 01:18:51.810]  So there it is again, butchering the Bill of Rights and saying that the Constitution says they have to do it.
[01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:58.195]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.235 --> 01:18:59.996]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.141 --> 01:19:09.033]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.253 --> 01:19:13.299]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.

[01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:55.276]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.

[01:20:06.546 --> 01:20:10.647]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards.

[01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.310]  They are instruments of debt.
[01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:19.651]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[01:20:20.212 --> 01:20:25.654]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.

[01:21:53.573 --> 01:21:55.034]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:55.394 --> 01:21:59.337]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:21:59.717 --> 01:22:03.239]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:07.182]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[01:22:07.562 --> 01:22:12.425]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:22:12.745 --> 01:22:18.551]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:22:18.872 --> 01:22:22.576]  I now wear my TriVides bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[01:22:22.936 --> 01:22:24.998]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:22:25.018 --> 01:22:31.105]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:22:31.525 --> 01:22:32.725]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:22:33.045 --> 01:22:34.166]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:22:34.246 --> 01:22:39.647]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[01:22:39.847 --> 01:22:43.308]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.

[01:22:44.909 --> 01:22:45.109]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:22:45.129 --> 01:22:45.469]  Hi, welcome back.
[01:22:58.337 --> 01:23:02.340]  I'm going to get into Iran right now, and then we'll come back and start taking your calls.
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:11.007]  Everybody that's patiently holding, Jason, Ray, Eric, Jeff, Dave, and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:23:11.047 --> 01:23:12.328]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:17.023 --> 01:23:17.664]  Well, the U.S.
[01:23:17.704 --> 01:23:21.586]  prepares military blitz against Iran's nuclear sites.
[01:23:21.646 --> 01:23:22.887]  London Telegraph headline.
[01:23:23.368 --> 01:23:24.448]  Very deceptive headline.
[01:23:24.508 --> 01:23:28.791]  It should say, peaceful reactor enrichment facilities.
[01:23:29.432 --> 01:23:34.856]  And the sub-headline is, 10,000 would die in an A-plant attack on Iran.
[01:23:36.059 --> 01:23:50.929]  Strategists at the Pentagon are drawing up plans for devastating bombing raids backed by submarine-launched ballistic missile attacks against Iran's nuclear sites as a last resort to block Tehran's efforts to develop an atomic bomb.
[01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:58.995]  Central Command and Strategic Command planners are identifying targets, assessing weapon loads, and working on logistics for an operation
[01:24:00.237 --> 01:24:02.038]  The Sunday Telegraph has learned.
[01:24:02.458 --> 01:24:15.582]  They are reporting to the office of Donald Rumsfeld, the Defense Secretary, as America updates plans for action if the diplomatic offensive fails to thwart the Islamic Republic's nuclear bomb ambitions.
[01:24:15.982 --> 01:24:20.143]  Tehran claims that it is developing only a civilian energy program.
[01:24:20.183 --> 01:24:21.984]  Well, the IAEA has certified that.
[01:24:22.444 --> 01:24:27.046]  This is more than just a standard military contingency assessment for the Senior Pentagon Advisor.
[01:24:27.086 --> 01:24:30.747]  This has taken on a much greater urgency in recent months.
[01:24:30.787 --> 01:24:36.670]  Before I get more into that, I'm trying to give you a big picture of what's going on in the Middle East and Central Asia right now.
[01:24:39.111 --> 01:24:42.992]  I work seven days a week normally because I know how desperate things are.
[01:24:43.012 --> 01:24:47.054]  I know how much danger our society and our country and that means my family is in.
[01:24:47.935 --> 01:24:51.396]  I have a sense of responsibility and most of you do too.
[01:24:52.506 --> 01:24:58.511]  Imagine, Dick Cheney in the middle of the week, every time I hear about where he's at or what he's doing, he's hunting.
[01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.533]  He's hunting all over the world.
[01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:03.575]  He's out of the White House six months out of the year.
[01:25:03.615 --> 01:25:06.137]  He disappears for two or three months at a time.
[01:25:06.157 --> 01:25:11.001]  And if they are planning to go into Iran, I want to know why Bush is always vacationing.
[01:25:11.502 --> 01:25:14.124]  I want to know why Bush is always playing hooky.
[01:25:14.144 --> 01:25:15.405]  I want to know why Cheney is.
[01:25:16.005 --> 01:25:29.669]  Now, obviously, Bush is a puppet, and Cheney is in more control than him, and then there's war planners above him, but it just shows how they're off busy shooting each other, and running around like a bunch of heathen, and the country is about to start World War III!
[01:25:30.609 --> 01:25:41.953]  And I've got a bunch of different mainstream news strategists reporting that this could trigger World War III, and the British analysts, even in Blair's government, are saying this will plunge us into a bigger global crisis,
[01:25:43.068 --> 01:25:45.009]  That's exactly what PNAC says.
[01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:54.475]  They want to make it so big and so bad that we get sucked into a full-bore, tooth-and-nail battle where they can resurrect the conscription, i.e.
[01:25:54.495 --> 01:25:57.096]  the draft, and do all of this stuff.
[01:25:57.910 --> 01:26:17.279]  And then you can't question their domestic activities, whether it's taking your pension funds or looting Fortune 500 companies, or giving all their buddies the defense contracts in total violation of federal law, or what all these lobbyists are busy doing because we'll be in the middle of a war and it's not patriotic to ask questions.
[01:26:18.459 --> 01:26:25.983]  Meanwhile, England, Germany, France, China, Japan, Israel... Israel is one of the biggest offenders.
[01:26:26.724 --> 01:26:29.326]  They literally have bought and paid for our Congress.
[01:26:29.546 --> 01:26:33.509]  They literally have lobbyists, foreign lobbyists, writing legislation.
[01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:41.856]  Here in Texas, a Mexican citizen, it's been in the Houston Chronicle, is the chief of border affairs while he's a lobbyist.
[01:26:41.876 --> 01:26:42.697]  That's illegal.
[01:26:44.018 --> 01:26:49.222]  Even the Houston Chronicle admitted it violates federal law while he sits in the governor's office.
[01:26:50.623 --> 01:26:53.986]  I mean, we openly have foreigners from Israel, Russia, China,
[01:26:55.035 --> 01:27:15.127]  Mexico, England, more than any other nation, sitting, not just inside the state houses in the federal capital, or the White House, writing the legislation, which they've been doing for years, now they're being given governmental positions of power.
[01:27:16.128 --> 01:27:21.331]  Well, that's an article we've got to write, because it's all buried in the news, but it's never even been given a headline.
[01:27:22.051 --> 01:27:23.592]  It needs to be top story.
[01:27:24.213 --> 01:27:28.397]  So that just gives you a picture of where we're at right now.
[01:27:29.478 --> 01:27:33.362]  And they are beating the war drums to go into Iran in a big way.
[01:27:34.904 --> 01:27:47.997]  The prospect of military action could put Washington at odds with Britain, which fears that an attack would spark violence across the Middle East, reprisals in the West, and may not cripple Tehran's nuclear program.
[01:27:48.852 --> 01:27:56.733]  But the steady flow of disclosures about Iran's secret nuclear operations and the virulent anti-Israeli threats of President
[01:27:57.723 --> 01:28:07.073]  Mahmood Ahmajadi, I'm sorry I can't pronounce it, never have been able to, has promoted and prompted the fresh assessment of military options by Washington.
[01:28:07.413 --> 01:28:18.685]  The most likely strategy would involve aerial bombardment by long-distance B-2 bombers, each armed with up to 40,000 pounds of precision munitions.
[01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:22.382]  Including the latest bunker-busting devices.
[01:28:22.782 --> 01:28:27.123]  They would fly from bases in Missouri with mid-air refueling.
[01:28:27.143 --> 01:28:29.563]  Boy, those pilots will be taking some speed pills.
[01:28:30.984 --> 01:28:32.544]  Well, hey, our government puts our kids on it.
[01:28:32.584 --> 01:28:33.064]  Must be good.
[01:28:33.344 --> 01:28:39.165]  The Bush administration has recently announced plans to add conventional ballistic missiles to the armory of its nuclear Trident submarines.
[01:28:39.625 --> 01:28:40.266]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.286 --> 01:28:42.426]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.046 --> 01:28:44.967]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.427 --> 01:28:46.927]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.936 --> 01:28:50.719]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.263 --> 01:28:57.846]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[01:29:54.496 --> 01:29:58.080]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:58.620]  are located?

[01:30:55.439 --> 01:30:58.102]  Is your quality of life reduced because of health problems?
[01:30:58.322 --> 01:31:00.104]  Are you starting to feel the signs of aging?
[01:31:00.284 --> 01:31:04.308]  Are you relatively healthy but wonder if you can do more to maintain proper health?
[01:31:04.488 --> 01:31:05.870]  Now there's Stem Enhance.
[01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:10.855]  Stem Enhance is a new product category of phytonutrients that help in renewing your body.

[01:32:09.755 --> 01:32:12.600]  Alright, your calls are just a minute or two away.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:15.144]  I'm not done talking about Iran.
[01:32:15.164 --> 01:32:24.058]  I want to get more into Pentagon plans, bomb blitz on Iran's nuclear sites, more details of what that attack will probably look like and when it may be coming.
[01:32:24.796 --> 01:32:27.339]  Iran, of course, has resumed atom enrichment work.
[01:32:27.439 --> 01:32:35.447]  Their diplomats are now saying Iran has resumed some uranium enrichment work, a first step towards making fuel for atomic reactors or bombs.
[01:32:36.108 --> 01:32:40.953]  Though they admit that they don't even have the equipment to create the fissile material for an A-bomb.
[01:32:40.993 --> 01:32:41.574]  It doesn't matter.
[01:32:41.914 --> 01:32:44.357]  The CIA's own report says it's not true, but so what?
[01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:58.483]  In defiance of a vote reporting Tehran to the UN Security Council, diplomatic sources said today, Iran has said it would restart enrichment, shelved for two years under Western pressure, by early March, but gave no date.
[01:32:59.312 --> 01:33:05.797]  Tehran also announced talks due this week on a Russian proposal to avert a showdown in the Security Council has been postponed.
[01:33:05.837 --> 01:33:11.501]  However, Moscow said it was prepared to go ahead with the talks on Thursday as planned.
[01:33:11.921 --> 01:33:16.004]  Meanwhile, Syria switches to Euro amid confrontation with the U.S.
[01:33:16.265 --> 01:33:19.127]  and China has begun dumping the dollar incrementally.
[01:33:20.207 --> 01:33:23.550]  Japan has been the stalwart buyer of the different U.S.
[01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:24.070]  security.
[01:33:24.090 --> 01:33:27.573]  They're beginning to sell a little bit, but not as much as China.
[01:33:28.787 --> 01:33:33.570]  Europe, of course, for four years, has been dumping dollars and moving away from the dollar.
[01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:36.312]  And let me tell you why this is important for those that don't know.
[01:33:36.412 --> 01:33:38.733]  Most of you probably are more informed than I am on this subject.
[01:33:38.753 --> 01:33:43.236]  For those that don't know, as I've heard yuppies on the radio say, so what if we have a weak dollar?
[01:33:43.276 --> 01:33:44.517]  It'll be good for manufacturing.
[01:33:44.797 --> 01:33:52.442]  Yeah, if we had any manufacturing base left and if we weren't competing against billions of people that slave labor, slave wages in China and India.
[01:33:53.709 --> 01:34:08.419]  You know, you can all talk about how you can go down to Mexico and for ten dollars take four or five people out to dinner and get a bunch of ice cold beer or buy a sombrero or whatever it is because the peso is a weak currency.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:17.345]  The peso is a weak currency and the people on average live in abject stifling oppressive poverty.
[01:34:18.306 --> 01:34:22.050]  And that is the hallmark of a banana republic, a third world country.
[01:34:22.451 --> 01:34:28.997]  Most of the world lives under that type of stifling currency devaluation.
[01:34:30.459 --> 01:34:37.466]  And the dollar has gone from four years ago being the strongest currency in the world for the last 75 years
[01:34:40.453 --> 01:35:04.967]  to being the one of the weakest currencies the weakest currency in the industrialized world and now becoming quite weak even compared to other second world nations and it's been done by the Federal Reserve heating up the printing presses to light speed and the new Federal Reserve Chairman if you thought Greenspan was bad
[01:35:07.043 --> 01:35:13.345]  Says that he wants to do the equivalent of dumping cash on the economy out of helicopters.
[01:35:13.685 --> 01:35:14.386]  That's a quote.
[01:35:14.766 --> 01:35:18.547]  He wants to accelerate the printing of money, and this is how the fraud works.
[01:35:19.087 --> 01:35:22.068]  And we could spend hours on this, but I'll just spend a few minutes, and we'll go to your calls.
[01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:31.712]  Bush gives you an average of an 8% tax cut, depending on what bracket you're in, but the average is about 8%.
[01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:35.432]  And then you think that you've gotten this huge tax cut.
[01:35:35.612 --> 01:35:40.034]  I would rather Bush not have allowed the devaluation of the currency by 44%.
[01:35:43.995 --> 01:35:49.717]  So, your bank account is devalued and it's buying power by 44%, but you get a tax cut of 8%.
[01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.618]  So, 8 out of 44, that comes to 36.
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:01.422]  So you really had a tax on your wealth of 36%.
[01:36:03.323 --> 01:36:14.710]  Now, would you rather not have a tax cut, but have your money stay the same value, or would you rather have a 36% devaluation, or would you rather have an 8% tax cut?
[01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.391]  I don't know.
[01:36:15.451 --> 01:36:16.211]  Can you do the math?
[01:36:17.072 --> 01:36:17.692]  I know you can.
[01:36:19.435 --> 01:36:34.119]  And it upsets me, because I have a little bit of money in the bank, hopefully for college someday, if my children wish to go, for a rainy day or an emergency, and even if you've got, say, an IRA giving you 5%, that is being outstripped.
[01:36:34.179 --> 01:36:37.519]  Inflation every year is conservatively at 10%.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.020]  I know they tell you it's at 4.2 or 4.3 in years past.
[01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:40.880]  It hovers between 4.0 and 4.4.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.361]  So we'll just say 4.2 is the average in the last five, six years.
[01:36:49.256 --> 01:36:56.420]  But real inflation is at around 10% and that doesn't even count the currency inflation.
[01:36:58.381 --> 01:36:59.782]  Because they're printing so much of it.
[01:37:00.162 --> 01:37:03.844]  It's a horrible economic indicator and economic fact.
[01:37:04.224 --> 01:37:07.105]  And I'm sorry to give you bad news, but this is the reality.
[01:37:07.666 --> 01:37:18.051]  That's why the media and the government try to badmouth real estate as an investment, while the very same politicians badmouthing real estate are out buying it as fast as they can.
[01:37:19.401 --> 01:37:27.127]  Because even if real estate is triple valued for what it really should be worth, at least there is some inherent value in that land.
[01:37:27.807 --> 01:37:34.292]  And even if real estate was to crash by, say, 50%, which they're saying in some areas of the country it may do, I don't know if it is.
[01:37:34.332 --> 01:37:38.715]  They keep saying it's already busted, the bubble's busted, but it doesn't seem to bust.
[01:37:39.015 --> 01:37:46.381]  They're hyping that because they don't like the fact that you've been able to put your money in something where it at least still has some value.
[01:37:47.643 --> 01:37:51.405]  I'm not talking about being upside down in real estate, going and leveraging yourself.
[01:37:51.525 --> 01:37:57.808]  No, I'm talking about actually owning property outright is still a really good investment.
[01:37:58.869 --> 01:38:05.412]  And the government does not like it, does not like it one single bit, so they're really hyping that.
[01:38:05.472 --> 01:38:10.435]  But even if it's overvalued, it at least has some inherent base value to it.
[01:38:12.388 --> 01:38:26.656]  And it's really frustrating to hear the neocons on the radio, and to argue with them on the street, or over the telephone, or in emails, where they're telling me how great the economy is, when every real indice, every real indicator shows the economy is going in the wrong direction.
[01:38:26.696 --> 01:38:37.763]  More factories shutting down, more people losing high-tech jobs, or manufacturing jobs, or value-added jobs, going into the service industry, even the service industry
[01:38:38.523 --> 01:38:53.159]  is contracting and remember our economy is contracting despite the fact that we have an infusion conservatively of six million new people every year in this country.
[01:38:55.046 --> 01:39:03.872]  We have gone from the last census at what just six years ago from 280 million people roughly to now over 300 million people.
[01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:36.274]  That's the new numbers coming out with the projections because they're now doing a year-by-year and of course it's totally unconstitutional but we have the numbers census and of course most illegal aliens don't even declare themselves on the census so it's actually much higher even with their projected numbers than six million a year and those six million predominantly unskilled low-wage workers working for about four bucks an hour then drives down all the rest of our wages in the aggregate.
[01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.732]  Okay, enough spew.
[01:39:39.232 --> 01:39:41.914]  I'm just spewing numbers at you, but those are the numbers.
[01:39:42.554 --> 01:39:52.400]  And then again, they claim we have about a 4% inflation number each year, but that is not counting what's happened with the currency.
[01:39:53.741 --> 01:39:55.802]  There's a lot of other numbers as well.
[01:39:56.322 --> 01:39:59.084]  Let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:39:59.724 --> 01:40:04.207]  Let's talk to Jason in California.
[01:40:04.287 --> 01:40:05.067]  Jason, welcome.
[01:40:05.888 --> 01:40:06.148]  Thank you.
[01:40:07.085 --> 01:40:08.506]  Hi, how are you?
[01:40:09.707 --> 01:40:09.927]  Good.
[01:40:10.747 --> 01:40:28.139]  With the Iranian oil burst coming up and all this Iranian stuff and the devaluation of the dollar and the money you just covered, and everybody knowing that obviously good investments are silver and gold and whatnot, I was wondering if you were familiar with the Liberty Dollar and alternative currencies like that?
[01:40:30.203 --> 01:40:37.237]  Well, you know, I think the Liberty Dollar and the Norfed money, the silver certificates, or the holding of physical silver itself is great.
[01:40:37.858 --> 01:40:38.961]  There is a markup
[01:40:40.004 --> 01:40:46.730]  Involved with those particular currencies of I guess about 10 percent, which is fine.
[01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:48.571]  You'll see that in pretty much any currency.
[01:40:48.912 --> 01:40:59.641]  But you can buy 1870s, 1880s, 1890s silver dollars that also have a collector value on top of them for less.
[01:40:59.761 --> 01:41:03.544]  You can buy them for like $9.50, at least a few weeks ago you could.
[01:41:03.584 --> 01:41:04.165]  I bought some.
[01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:04.865]  I see.
[01:41:04.885 --> 01:41:05.365]  I understand that.
[01:41:05.425 --> 01:41:06.606]  But that doesn't sound very liquid.
[01:41:06.626 --> 01:41:09.487]  It doesn't provide a good medium of exchange.
[01:41:26.535 --> 01:41:37.186]  Well, I mean, if you can get somebody to accept a silver dollar printed by a private group of 9999 silver, why would you not want a U.S.
[01:41:37.226 --> 01:41:37.586]  silver?
[01:41:37.606 --> 01:41:39.248]  At least people can see it says U.S.
[01:41:39.348 --> 01:41:43.773]  on it and people tend to know what it's worth and in the past it has a greater value.
[01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:45.685]  I see.
[01:41:45.885 --> 01:41:47.185]  I mean, you asked me what I thought of it.
[01:41:47.225 --> 01:41:47.986]  I don't think it's bad.
[01:41:48.086 --> 01:41:49.326]  No, I understand.
[01:41:49.486 --> 01:41:58.068]  Listen, I don't think it's bad to have those currencies, but I know this, you're going to get more for the government currency, the treasury currency, the old U.S.
[01:41:58.088 --> 01:41:58.488]  currency.
[01:41:58.688 --> 01:41:59.308]  That's what it is.
[01:41:59.348 --> 01:42:00.628]  It isn't Federal Reserve currency.
[01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:03.429]  When you go into a coin shop, if it's U.S.
[01:42:03.849 --> 01:42:09.910]  or if it's German or it's British or it's French or it's Swiss, then you're going to get with these new U.S.
[01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:10.370]  currencies.
[01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:14.871]  And there are communities trading in them, there are people promoting them, and I think that's fine and dandy.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.042]  I think both of them are fine.
[01:42:24.942 --> 01:42:28.444]  It's just that it's really hard to find people that will trade in that.
[01:42:28.484 --> 01:42:37.847]  In fact, I know people who have been arrested or attempted to be arrested trying to use that because the clerks are so stupid.
[01:42:38.267 --> 01:42:40.328]  But it's like the guy a few months ago, remember?
[01:42:40.748 --> 01:42:42.269]  Upstanding member of the community, by the way.
[01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:43.590]  Where was that in the country?
[01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:44.470]  Somewhere in the Midwest.
[01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:48.853]  He tried to go in at Best Buy with a $2 bill.
[01:42:48.873 --> 01:42:50.574]  He had some of those in a safe.
[01:42:53.036 --> 01:42:53.637]  It was U.S.
[01:42:53.657 --> 01:42:54.157]  currency.
[01:42:54.177 --> 01:42:55.978]  It was actually Federal Reserve currency.
[01:42:56.619 --> 01:42:59.541]  The police came and arrested him thinking it was counterfeit.
[01:42:59.861 --> 01:43:02.003]  As if a counterfeiter would print up $3 bills.
[01:43:02.103 --> 01:43:03.004]  Well, they thought the $2 bills
[01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:04.845]  We're as phony as a $3 bill.
[01:43:04.885 --> 01:43:05.685]  That's how dumb.
[01:43:06.066 --> 01:43:13.250]  No one in the Best Buy, not the managers it said for an hour, they held him there as managers and others debated whether a $2 bill was real.
[01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:15.531]  That's how dumb the general public is, sir.
[01:43:15.551 --> 01:43:17.032]  They don't even know what $2 bills are.
[01:43:17.513 --> 01:43:18.713]  I think that was actually a Taco Bell, huh?
[01:43:19.274 --> 01:43:20.034]  No, it was Best Buy.
[01:43:20.054 --> 01:43:20.735]  Oh, it was a Best Buy?
[01:43:20.875 --> 01:43:21.935]  There may have been a Taco Bell, too.
[01:43:22.516 --> 01:43:22.696]  Yeah.
[01:43:24.677 --> 01:43:25.017]  I understand.
[01:43:25.237 --> 01:43:25.458]  I see.
[01:43:25.498 --> 01:43:32.422]  Yeah, because actually my local community here, I'm getting, uh, I just started this and I've actually got a few merchants already that are willing to stop just starting a little association and
[01:43:33.896 --> 01:43:34.837]  I think that's great.
[01:43:35.237 --> 01:43:44.121]  It's more of the angle, not so much to promote the silver, as much to get local merchants to accept the currency and give it out as change so they can actually make profit.
[01:43:44.141 --> 01:43:50.123]  But it builds the local business, the mom-and-pop type stores against the Walmart type stores.
[01:43:50.143 --> 01:43:50.784]  I think it's great.
[01:43:50.804 --> 01:43:51.504]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:52.244 --> 01:43:54.205]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Texas.
[01:43:54.305 --> 01:43:54.965]  Ray, go ahead.
[01:43:55.786 --> 01:43:56.026]  Hey.
[01:43:56.526 --> 01:43:56.746]  Hi.
[01:43:56.786 --> 01:43:57.387]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:58.067 --> 01:43:58.687]  My name's Ray.
[01:43:59.367 --> 01:44:00.288]  I've got a question here.
[01:44:01.314 --> 01:44:03.935]  Is it true that every branch of the U.S.
[01:44:03.976 --> 01:44:05.857]  government has corporate status?
[01:44:06.197 --> 01:44:09.419]  That each branch of the government is technically its own corporation?
[01:44:09.619 --> 01:44:17.243]  Yes, and now they're going public with that, privatizing everything, simply signing governmental power over to private Merck institutions.
[01:44:18.408 --> 01:44:22.329]  If this is so, that means we're under maritime law, not constitutional law.
[01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:31.733]  I have seen so many federal court documents in modern times, where they're taking somebody's property, say in Colorado, and there's no due process, and the woman goes in and says, why?
[01:44:32.033 --> 01:44:33.814]  And the judge says, you're now under admiralty.
[01:44:34.194 --> 01:44:36.495]  Yes, we're in receivership, sir.
[01:44:37.975 --> 01:44:45.198]  I know, and any court of admiralty has to display a gold-fringed flag, much like the flag they flew at the Super Bowl.
[01:44:46.036 --> 01:44:47.656]  Yes, symbols mean things.
[01:44:47.736 --> 01:44:48.777]  It's a war flag.
[01:44:49.557 --> 01:44:53.918]  And the problem is you go into these courts with your little flag and declare yourself separate.
[01:44:54.338 --> 01:44:56.378]  The judges have now been told to disregard that.
[01:44:56.418 --> 01:45:00.499]  They're just acting in criminal behavior and just ignore it.
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.280]  It's just the government gives their minions uniforms.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:05.920]  They're private.
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:07.181]  They have little machine guns.
[01:45:07.441 --> 01:45:08.561]  They built private prisons.
[01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:09.961]  It's all about force now.
[01:45:11.302 --> 01:45:12.862]  I heard something even crazier.
[01:45:14.105 --> 01:45:16.568]  Maritime law deals with bodies of water.
[01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:18.270]  Now, the human body... No, no.
[01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:29.783]  Maritime originally... Admiralty, or martial law, it simply means rule of the general, rule of the captain, rule by the designate of the monarch.
[01:45:30.425 --> 01:45:47.711]  And so, whereas classically, it has been the operative rule on the high seas, where each ship is its own country, and the captain or the admiral is God, or the sovereign, don't confuse that.
[01:45:47.871 --> 01:45:52.533]  Admiralty or martial law is invoked on land more often than at sea.
[01:45:53.353 --> 01:45:55.614]  Right, and bodies of water are owned.
[01:45:57.186 --> 01:46:00.049]  Yeah, but I mean, it doesn't say because your body's made out of water.
[01:46:00.089 --> 01:46:02.210]  It just simply means you're under martial law.
[01:46:02.651 --> 01:46:03.791]  Law is crazy like that.
[01:46:03.812 --> 01:46:05.113]  It could be to the word like that.
[01:46:05.133 --> 01:46:05.733]  I'm just wondering.
[01:46:05.893 --> 01:46:06.574]  Well, it could be.
[01:46:06.594 --> 01:46:10.337]  I mean, it could be that tooth fairies are real, but I'm telling you what it actually says.
[01:46:11.037 --> 01:46:11.638]  I got you, man.
[01:46:12.098 --> 01:46:13.759]  I'm not trying to be sarcastic or rude to you.
[01:46:13.779 --> 01:46:22.827]  I'm just, there's a lot of crazy people out there who take real information and then add what I call patriot mythology to it, hence discrediting us.
[01:46:24.008 --> 01:46:24.408]  No doubt.
[01:46:24.861 --> 01:46:26.975]  Who is the General Delaware Corporation?
[01:46:28.605 --> 01:46:32.328]  That's one of these older global corporations.
[01:46:32.388 --> 01:46:33.949]  The British East India Company is one.
[01:46:34.290 --> 01:46:35.371]  The Bank of England is another.
[01:46:35.431 --> 01:46:41.235]  The Federal Reserve is its office here in this governorship, this commonwealth.
[01:46:41.255 --> 01:46:41.936]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:42.356 --> 01:46:43.197]  Really good questions.
[01:46:43.217 --> 01:46:45.438]  I mean, I've got the federal court cases.
[01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:48.441]  That's what infrastructure protection means.
[01:46:49.001 --> 01:46:56.407]  Under Homeland Security, we're now going into receivership, and it is simply officers in the corporation engaging in infrastructure protection.
[01:46:57.328 --> 01:46:59.210]  Let's go, that is owned by the company.
[01:47:00.672 --> 01:47:04.015]  We're going to be basically sharecroppers living on the slave plantation.
[01:47:04.696 --> 01:47:09.761]  Let's talk to Evan in Reno, Nevada.
[01:47:09.801 --> 01:47:10.722]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:47:11.643 --> 01:47:12.824]  Alex, how you doing?
[01:47:12.904 --> 01:47:13.245]  Good, sir.
[01:47:14.266 --> 01:47:20.492]  I was just calling to see if you know about the petition to release the testimony of Sybil Evans.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:21.820]  You know who she is?
[01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:24.862]  Yes, we've had her on and had her push her petition.
[01:47:25.242 --> 01:47:27.583]  She's been gagged from releasing the information she knows.
[01:47:27.643 --> 01:47:37.847]  All she said is, she will say, okay, well it's like this, and then she'll talk about other historical cases of government drug dealing or the government carrying out terror attacks, and then she says that's what she heard.
[01:47:38.407 --> 01:47:42.469]  She worked, of course, with the FBI looking at NSA data.
[01:47:43.289 --> 01:47:44.090]  I figured you out.
[01:47:44.150 --> 01:47:45.590]  I thought I'd just plug it.
[01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:47.451]  No, no, it's very important information.
[01:47:48.007 --> 01:47:49.508]  Justacitizen.org.
[01:47:49.708 --> 01:47:52.210]  Everyone go to justacitizen.org.
[01:47:52.410 --> 01:47:53.911]  Make sure you go sign that petition.
[01:47:53.951 --> 01:47:55.372]  Let's get that information out there.
[01:47:55.432 --> 01:47:57.453]  She could be the Daniel Ellsberg of 9-11.
[01:47:57.553 --> 01:48:00.195]  Well, it's very important.
[01:48:00.215 --> 01:48:06.199]  She heard them talk about drug dealing and government involvement in 9-11, and she tried to go public, and they said, national security, you can't.
[01:48:06.259 --> 01:48:09.421]  And so did FBI agent Robert Wright, National Press Club.
[01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:10.161]  He said, here's the letter.
[01:48:10.181 --> 01:48:11.582]  I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[01:48:12.002 --> 01:48:14.824]  All we can tell you is the Bushes' vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[01:48:16.345 --> 01:48:16.645]  Yeah.
[01:48:16.826 --> 01:48:17.286]  Anything else?
[01:48:18.137 --> 01:48:18.677]  No, that's it.
[01:48:18.697 --> 01:48:19.217]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:48:19.577 --> 01:48:20.117]  Thank you.
[01:48:20.357 --> 01:48:21.658]  Jeff in Denver, you're on the air.
[01:48:21.718 --> 01:48:22.138]  Go ahead.
[01:48:23.158 --> 01:48:23.718]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:48:23.798 --> 01:48:25.579]  I just wanted to make a couple of points.
[01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:37.901]  Well, first of all, I think there's millions of truck drivers across the country, and I really don't think the American people know the impact that the truck drivers have on this country.
[01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:41.142]  And I think that more of the truck drivers are getting involved.
[01:48:41.182 --> 01:48:46.623]  I'm not saying all, but there's millions of them that are trying to fight
[01:48:47.475 --> 01:48:53.381]  I would say truck drivers are one of the most informed guilds or groups in America.
[01:48:53.501 --> 01:49:07.316]  As a group itself, they are probably the most informed because they listen on books on tape, they listen to talk radio, they listen to shortwave, they listen to wireless internet, and a lot of them are PrisonPlanet.tv members when they get home.
[01:49:07.956 --> 01:49:17.378]  For the weekend, they will burn dozens of copies of my TV shows, radio shows, and then they will go hand them out at truck stops, and they're absolutely saving this country.
[01:49:17.558 --> 01:49:18.019]  Exactly.
[01:49:18.039 --> 01:49:20.239]  Let me tell you something about these guys, Alex.
[01:49:20.639 --> 01:49:26.961]  They go out... The reason that they aren't trying to fight the New World Order is because, you know, you got guys out here living out of their trucks.
[01:49:27.641 --> 01:49:31.162]  You got 73-year-old men that can't even retire.
[01:49:31.894 --> 01:49:34.076]  Because of the way that the economy is.
[01:49:34.136 --> 01:49:34.737]  They're slaves.
[01:49:35.057 --> 01:49:35.417]  Slaves!
[01:49:35.817 --> 01:49:41.462]  And the truck drivers, I think, are... Well, can I... Yeah, sure.
[01:49:42.423 --> 01:49:44.385]  But all my praise for the good truck drivers.
[01:49:44.425 --> 01:49:45.286]  It was just amazing.
[01:49:45.306 --> 01:49:46.407]  They're doing a wonderful job.
[01:49:46.987 --> 01:49:48.108]  Backbone of this country.
[01:49:48.288 --> 01:49:48.949]  Really, they are.
[01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:50.631]  Hail the truck drivers!
[01:49:55.177 --> 01:49:58.039]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.279 --> 01:49:59.861]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:04.884]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.225 --> 01:50:11.970]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:14.272]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.472 --> 01:50:17.314]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.414 --> 01:50:22.058]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.278 --> 01:50:26.661]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.922 --> 01:50:34.147]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:01.858 --> 01:52:04.119]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:52:11.042 --> 01:52:11.342]  I think so.
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:31.480]  I think so.
[01:53:00.848 --> 01:53:05.833]  I'm back to Jeff and Dave and Dave and Dave and Don and many others here.
[01:53:05.853 --> 01:53:11.579]  In the third hour, there's a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten into yet.
[01:53:12.199 --> 01:53:13.280]  Thousands will die of U.S.
[01:53:13.321 --> 01:53:15.082]  strikes on Iran, a study.
[01:53:15.723 --> 01:53:20.608]  We'll get into what the Iranian president is saying, North Korea threatening to nuke us again.
[01:53:21.654 --> 01:53:25.958]  We'll get into police gassing students over in Pakistan.
[01:53:26.478 --> 01:53:28.019]  And is the President above the law?
[01:53:28.059 --> 01:53:29.040]  That's the big headline.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.521]  I want to spend some time on that.
[01:53:30.922 --> 01:53:34.945]  Before we go back to your calls, my new film, The Order of Death, is out.
[01:53:35.686 --> 01:53:41.670]  And new footage, last July, was shot inside the Bohemian Grove, where the elite engage in satanic ceremonies.
[01:53:42.051 --> 01:53:42.871]  It's mainstream news.
[01:53:42.891 --> 01:53:44.593]  I don't care how crazy it sounds, it's real.
[01:53:45.746 --> 01:53:50.948]  And then we have footage he shot there over a two-year period in the film.
[01:53:50.968 --> 01:53:54.149]  And then we have locals doing their own rituals against the Grovers.
[01:53:54.509 --> 01:53:58.510]  The very locals that criticized me for talking about how the occult is going on in there.
[01:53:58.530 --> 01:53:59.831]  Well, we know why, because they're into it.
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:07.082]  And we also then show how the Illuminati is tied into the Ku Klux Klan, tied into high-level masons, even though most masons aren't aware of it.
[01:54:07.782 --> 01:54:11.384]  We just get into the globalist secret activities.
[01:54:11.984 --> 01:54:16.866]  And then we updated the original film I made in 2000, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:17.546 --> 01:54:23.128]  We updated that just a few months ago and put both films, the new film and the original film, updated on one DVD, $24.95.
[01:54:23.168 --> 01:54:26.589]  And the next copy is $19.95, next copy $16.95, next copy $14.
[01:54:30.490 --> 01:54:32.632]  So we put an incentive in there to get multiple copies.
[01:54:32.672 --> 01:54:35.955]  Get one for yourself, then give another or two as a gift.
[01:54:35.995 --> 01:54:37.917]  And people that want to support us, that's how you do it.

[01:55:19.047 --> 01:55:21.569]  Alright, Jeff and Denver, finish up about the truck drivers.
[01:55:22.089 --> 01:55:28.233]  Yeah, Alex, I just wanted to say that, well, billions of truck drivers out here.
[01:55:28.693 --> 01:55:29.914]  It's like one big family.
[01:55:30.274 --> 01:55:35.637]  And of course, Bush, he wants us to be afraid, because paranoia is supposed to be patriotic.
[01:55:36.057 --> 01:55:40.460]  But I got a message for Bush, the White House terrorist, the tech-secutioner,
[01:55:41.690 --> 01:55:44.393]  The truck drivers, we're not going to allow for any police state.
[01:55:44.473 --> 01:55:48.317]  There's millions of truck drivers out here, and they're not going to go forward.
[01:55:48.337 --> 01:55:49.498]  They're going to fight it tooth and nail.
[01:55:49.558 --> 01:56:00.969]  And so far, Alex, three states, Hawaii, Alaska, and Vermont, and 218 cities and towns across the country, have enacted resolutions.
[01:56:04.266 --> 01:56:07.353]  Calling for repeal of the Patriot Act in whole or in part.
[01:56:07.573 --> 01:56:08.094]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:56:08.134 --> 01:56:09.357]  Let me give you the actual numbers.
[01:56:09.397 --> 01:56:10.039]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:14.208]  It's well in excess of 600 cities and towns and in seven states, sir.
[01:56:16.002 --> 01:56:20.684]  But for some reason the nightly news, when they do announce it, they'll say four hundred cities and four states.
[01:56:20.904 --> 01:56:25.365]  It's seven states and six hundred cities and towns the last time I checked.
[01:56:25.885 --> 01:56:28.066]  And they didn't pass laws calling for the repeal.
[01:56:28.586 --> 01:56:31.167]  That's in most of the city resolutions and laws.
[01:56:31.627 --> 01:56:37.789]  They passed laws telling their police to not violate the Constitution and to not aid the feds in the violation of that.
[01:56:38.329 --> 01:56:40.150]  So it's even better news than what you're saying.
[01:56:40.530 --> 01:56:42.510]  Dave in Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:56:44.881 --> 01:56:46.461]  Such a treat to be able to talk to you.
[01:56:46.501 --> 01:56:48.502]  I've been getting into you for the past three or four months.
[01:56:48.642 --> 01:56:49.742]  Well, it's a treat to talk to you.
[01:56:49.762 --> 01:56:50.442]  What's on your mind?
[01:56:50.482 --> 01:56:52.123]  I'll try to do this like a Jim Rome show.
[01:56:52.143 --> 01:56:55.924]  Really quickly, not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators.
[01:56:55.984 --> 01:56:57.284]  Adolf Hitler, 1938.
[01:56:57.384 --> 01:57:00.445]  I'll take my responses off the air.
[01:57:00.825 --> 01:57:07.807]  I found a great video called The Cowboys in Iraq, and for people who haven't seen it, it might wake you up or see something you haven't seen.
[01:57:07.927 --> 01:57:08.847]  Send me a copy of it.
[01:57:08.907 --> 01:57:09.627]  What else is on your mind?
[01:57:10.226 --> 01:57:10.526]  Awesome.
[01:57:10.707 --> 01:57:20.076]  The other day I found a thing on Halliburton's website, January 24th, 2006, saying that they got $385 million to, uh... Build domestic camps.
[01:57:20.096 --> 01:57:21.918]  You want my take on that, or do you want to comment on it?
[01:57:22.218 --> 01:57:26.662]  Um, well, just, uh, it was nice to see your logic working out on my computer.
[01:57:27.023 --> 01:57:30.426]  Also, I... I don't know, you and I would have been little kids, but... Stay there, sir.
[01:57:30.766 --> 01:57:31.647]  Third hour's coming up.
[01:57:31.667 --> 01:57:32.368]  We'll let you finish.
[01:57:33.590 --> 01:57:38.475]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:50.670]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:52.391]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.112 --> 01:57:54.213]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.873 --> 01:57:55.694]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.455 --> 01:57:57.355]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.016 --> 01:58:01.719]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.283]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.759 --> 01:58:17.501]  Well, North Korea's threatening us again.
[01:58:17.541 --> 01:58:19.303]  Threatening South Korea, but that's okay.
[01:58:19.343 --> 01:58:23.386]  They've got A-bombs and missiles to hit us, so we'll just leave them alone.
[01:58:23.426 --> 01:58:27.370]  And then Iran won't have an A-bomb for 10 years, but they're the big threat.
[01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:32.474]  We've got to attack them because they're a pushover, at least more so than North Korea or China.
[01:58:34.031 --> 01:58:36.752]  And we'll get into, is the presidency above the law?
[01:58:36.812 --> 01:58:41.074]  More and more discussion of this, the dictatorship, just being discussed right out in the open.
[01:58:41.654 --> 01:59:01.023]  The total free number to join us today, wide open phones, I'm going to take a lot of calls in this hour, we've already taken a lot of calls today, doing a pretty good job of that, 1-800-259-9231 with your questions, your comments, news you want to discuss, any questions you have, you disagree with me, you agree, whatever, we don't censor your calls, we don't restrict what you can talk about,
[01:59:01.664 --> 01:59:03.970]  We just ask what your first name is and where you're calling from.
[01:59:04.491 --> 01:59:07.359]  And you can just say your name's John Doe or Mud if you want.
[01:59:07.399 --> 01:59:08.262]  We don't even care about that.
[01:59:09.048 --> 01:59:09.328]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:09.528 --> 01:59:18.072]  We're not like mainstream talk radio that has to censor and screen and try to control, because we can defend our ideas.
[01:59:18.873 --> 01:59:21.154]  Let's go to Dave in Virginia, finishing up what he was saying.
[01:59:21.174 --> 01:59:21.754]  Dave, go ahead.
[01:59:22.254 --> 01:59:24.655]  Alright, let's bust some lips, Alex.
[01:59:24.855 --> 01:59:33.659]  Basically, I just said the whole thing about the cowboys in Iraq and Halliburton News talking about $385 million to build detention camps over the past five years.
[01:59:33.699 --> 01:59:37.181]  But then I was leading into, you and I would have been just still little kids,
[01:59:37.659 --> 01:59:47.505]  But Wikipedia turned my eyes on to the whole October Surprise conspiracy where Reagan and Bush supposedly, possibly postponed release of hostages.
[01:59:47.525 --> 01:59:49.066]  Well, there's no supposedly about it.
[01:59:49.106 --> 01:59:49.486]  They did it.
[01:59:49.686 --> 01:59:58.531]  Thank you so much, and then I guess the last thing I was going to say, and I'll take the comments off the air, listen to it in a few seconds here when it comes through the stream.
[01:59:59.772 --> 02:00:02.234]  It's not trying to pose a red herring question.
[02:00:02.534 --> 02:00:06.316]  I had never heard of this individual before, and as I read about his life, it was kind of
[02:00:07.327 --> 02:00:09.829]  Inspiring, kind of like with what you've been doing.
[02:00:10.009 --> 02:00:12.772]  I'm only 26, so you dig what I'm saying.
[02:00:13.512 --> 02:00:16.095]  Lyndon LaRoche, I had never heard of him before.
[02:00:17.936 --> 02:00:19.257]  It's LaRouche.
[02:00:19.457 --> 02:00:20.638]  LaRouche, thank you so much.
[02:00:20.678 --> 02:00:26.023]  Well, I'll take all your responses off the air, but thank you very much for rebuilding Mount Carmel.
[02:00:26.043 --> 02:00:27.204]  You're only 26, that's so far out.
[02:00:28.590 --> 02:00:29.651]  Keep up the good work, man.
[02:00:29.691 --> 02:00:30.351]  You kick ass.
[02:00:30.691 --> 02:00:32.232]  Well, I appreciate it.
[02:00:32.252 --> 02:00:39.297]  The listeners built a memorial church for all those that died, including the Davidians and the police, the military out there.
[02:00:39.317 --> 02:00:40.498]  It was just terrible what happened.
[02:00:41.338 --> 02:00:46.201]  As for Lyndon LaRouche, great information, documented, the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:00:46.802 --> 02:00:48.563]  I disagree with their solutions.
[02:00:49.123 --> 02:00:53.786]  You see, somebody can talk about the real problems and then give a solution that I don't agree with.
[02:00:54.567 --> 02:00:56.028]  And I've dealt with the LaRoucheites.
[02:00:58.177 --> 02:01:01.500]  I just, that's really something I steer clear of.
[02:01:02.241 --> 02:01:08.006]  Their information is fine and dandy, I just, there's better organizations to join.
[02:01:08.046 --> 02:01:13.030]  In my opinion, I'm not trying to pick a fight here, and I could go through a lot of reasons, but I don't want to spend all day on it.
[02:01:13.791 --> 02:01:15.512]  It's just I don't agree with their solutions.
[02:01:16.213 --> 02:01:17.954]  Pretty socialistic if you ask me.
[02:01:19.075 --> 02:01:24.120]  And also, I mean, just one time I called up, they said call and offer a TV show in order of free.
[02:01:25.130 --> 02:01:26.591]  The Executive Intelligence Report.
[02:01:26.631 --> 02:01:28.451]  This was about 12, 14 years ago.
[02:01:28.471 --> 02:01:35.773]  It was about 13 years ago, and I called, and they just hammered me, and they kept calling me, and calling me, and calling me to donate.
[02:01:36.294 --> 02:01:45.696]  So it's kind of like what happens when some religious group comes to your door and bugs the daylights out of you, but over the telephone.
[02:01:45.716 --> 02:01:47.457]  So that's a reason enough right there.
[02:01:49.803 --> 02:01:51.824]  I don't want to start talking about red herring.
[02:01:52.184 --> 02:01:52.984]  It isn't a red herring.
[02:01:53.124 --> 02:01:55.205]  We've got to talk about different organizations and different groups.
[02:01:55.785 --> 02:01:59.946]  My business is not bashing groups that are out there trying to fight the New World Order.
[02:01:59.966 --> 02:02:03.667]  I think you can get a lot of good information from Lenin, LaRouche, and others.
[02:02:04.188 --> 02:02:06.228]  I like some of the folks that have broken away from them.
[02:02:06.648 --> 02:02:09.529]  Webster Tarpley is one of those and some other individuals.
[02:02:09.649 --> 02:02:12.670]  We've had some of the LaRouche people on the show before as guests.
[02:02:13.374 --> 02:02:23.739]  So, I'm not saying they're evil or bad, I'm just saying, uh, annoying would be a good term for it, and then their solutions, uh, I really don't think are kosher.
[02:02:24.725 --> 02:02:25.126]  All right.
[02:02:25.586 --> 02:02:26.928]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:02:27.008 --> 02:02:28.510]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:02:28.530 --> 02:02:28.570]  800-259-9231.
[02:02:28.590 --> 02:02:29.951]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[02:02:45.849 --> 02:02:50.218]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.398 --> 02:02:54.746]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:59.531]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:02:59.591 --> 02:03:00.793]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.129 --> 02:03:26.571]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.851 --> 02:03:32.232]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:49.687 --> 02:03:58.517]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.837 --> 02:04:03.523]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.983 --> 02:04:10.706]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:11.086 --> 02:04:22.852]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:23.352 --> 02:04:27.814]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:04:45.862 --> 02:04:52.748]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:04:52.888 --> 02:05:05.819]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:05:05.999 --> 02:05:07.781]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:05:07.961 --> 02:05:11.422]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:05:11.702 --> 02:05:15.484]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:05:15.744 --> 02:05:20.686]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:05:20.966 --> 02:05:22.686]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:05:22.947 --> 02:05:26.908]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotion.
[02:05:27.168 --> 02:05:29.029]  Zango is what you are looking for.

[02:05:45.572 --> 02:05:50.615]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.975 --> 02:05:53.257]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:07.862 --> 02:06:10.085]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:06:10.285 --> 02:06:10.986]  until 2 p.m.
[02:06:11.086 --> 02:06:12.528]  Central Standard Time.
[02:06:12.948 --> 02:06:16.993]  We're here live and then of course back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:06:17.033 --> 02:06:27.004]  I want to take a moment out to thank all of our AM and FM affiliates, satellites, internet, shortwave, the micros, everybody out there doing a great job.
[02:06:27.997 --> 02:06:50.469]  Also, the folks here at my main office in Austin, Texas, Paul Watson and Steve Watson, his brother in the United Kingdom, doing a great job over at PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com, and of course, my radio producer, everybody, our sponsors, the listeners, all of you for being involved in the fight for this country, for this republic.
[02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:54.845]  We're going to continue with open phones throughout this hour.
[02:06:55.565 --> 02:06:58.287]  Let me just mention this now, and we'll get into more detail on it.
[02:06:58.307 --> 02:07:01.929]  I also have a little newscast clip about Cheney shooting his hunting buddy.
[02:07:02.569 --> 02:07:04.070]  That's a side issue, but it is interesting.
[02:07:04.110 --> 02:07:08.773]  I'll talk a little bit more about that, some of the suspicious things coming out of the story.
[02:07:08.813 --> 02:07:12.295]  But right now, he is the president above the law.
[02:07:13.255 --> 02:07:17.758]  And his lawyers, the entire gaggle of them, the entire group of poltroons,
[02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:42.740]  have been running around in memo after memo and in briefing after briefing and in court case after court case in briefs they filed saying that the president can order the torture of children, the president can order people tortured to death, the president can order children to be mutilated, the president, if the Patriot Act isn't reauthorized, can still enforce it.
[02:07:44.041 --> 02:07:45.661]  The classical 110 percent
[02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:56.114]  Real McCoy definition of manifest tyranny, despotism, dictatorship.
[02:07:58.315 --> 02:08:02.017]  Everything you see in the Declaration of Independence coming back to life.
[02:08:02.037 --> 02:08:06.599]  We're even fighting the same families as we were fighting in those days.
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:10.681]  The royal families of Europe and their Tory servants.
[02:08:11.801 --> 02:08:13.603]  Is the President above the law?
[02:08:13.843 --> 02:08:18.868]  And it's being discussed on Meet the Press, it's being discussed on CNN, on Fox, it's everywhere.
[02:08:19.229 --> 02:08:26.356]  And every time I see an editorial, it either says it's horrible and an abomination, and conservatives and liberals are saying that together,
[02:08:27.396 --> 02:08:35.923]  Or they're saying, yes, he is a dictator for your own safety, and it's a good thing, and the Constitution says he has to do this.
[02:08:36.023 --> 02:08:36.864]  It's his job.
[02:08:37.144 --> 02:08:42.528]  It's not only his duty, but it's just a prerequisite, and the Constitution says this.
[02:08:45.090 --> 02:08:48.493]  And of course, the Constitution says the exact opposite.
[02:08:48.533 --> 02:08:49.754]  That's what's so amazing.
[02:08:51.215 --> 02:08:55.278]  But here's an article by Doug Thompson of Capitol Hill Blue that came out today.
[02:08:56.494 --> 02:08:58.375]  He is the president above the law.
[02:08:58.475 --> 02:09:17.481]  Most of the news stories about Meet the Press debate Sunday on President George W. Bush's domestic spying program centers on comments that both Democrats and Republicans now feel the program is useless because Al-Qaeda, Al-C-I-A-D-A, knows the NSA is listening and they won't use cell phones to discuss their plans.
[02:09:17.901 --> 02:09:21.522]  Any real terrorist group, any real intelligence agency already knew that, folks.
[02:09:22.102 --> 02:09:25.243]  But that's not the real story that came out of Sunday's political
[02:09:26.326 --> 02:09:26.686]  Debate.
[02:09:27.687 --> 02:09:42.061]  The real story is that Pat Roberts, the arrogant Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told show host Tim Russert that he believes the President of the United States is above the law and can do whatever he pleases.
[02:09:42.868 --> 02:09:58.099]  Roberts, a staunch defender of Bush's right to spy on who he wants, whenever he wants, and however he wants, told Russert that Bush can and should ignore the law when he feels it is in the best interest of national security.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:02.602]  And if somebody T-voted this or taped it, I didn't see it, please mail it to me.
[02:10:02.622 --> 02:10:03.383]  We're looking for the clip.
[02:10:04.504 --> 02:10:09.247]  That prompted Russert to ask... Oh, I was just told it's on Crooks and Liars.
[02:10:09.327 --> 02:10:10.648]  Guys, go check that and see if it's there.
[02:10:12.128 --> 02:10:15.610]  Senator Roberts, quote, now this is the quote here.
[02:10:18.651 --> 02:10:21.792]  Senator Roberts, let me ask you a very serious question.
[02:10:22.192 --> 02:10:29.936]  Do you believe that the Constitution gives the President of the United States the authority to do anything he believes is necessary to protect the country?
[02:10:30.256 --> 02:10:31.437]  That was a question from Russet.
[02:10:32.117 --> 02:10:34.298]  To which Roberts replies, yes.
[02:10:35.479 --> 02:10:40.060]  Roberts later said he believed the President's authority was above laws passed by Congress.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:49.983]  In other words, George W. Bush is a dictator with absolute authority and no one, not the law and certainly not Congress, has the power to question or override that authority.
[02:10:50.263 --> 02:10:53.884]  Funny, I thought they had to declare war, levy it, order how it's prosecuted.
[02:10:55.302 --> 02:10:56.942]  Stop for a second and think about this.
[02:10:57.002 --> 02:11:11.665]  The Senate Intelligence Committee and its counterpart in the House are the only Congressional bodies that are told, and in most cases only in part, what the White House is up to when it comes to spying on Americans, ripping the Constitution to shreds, and trampling on the rights of the nation's citizens.
[02:11:12.185 --> 02:11:20.767]  And the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee believes the President has absolute power to do whatever he pleases with no Congressional oversight.
[02:11:22.012 --> 02:11:26.973]  That smoke you smell is the Bill of Rights of the Constitution going up in flames.
[02:11:27.454 --> 02:11:43.298]  That pounding you may soon hear on your roof, on your door, is George W. Bush's Gestapo, the so-called Department of Homeland Security, demanding your papers and hauling you away, I would add to Halliburton camps, because you dare speak out about their Fuhrer's policies.
[02:11:44.563 --> 02:11:58.354]  In the rubber-stampers who are supposed to run things in Congress believe Bush is all-powerful and his actions beyond reproach, then the America as a free nation ceased to exist the day these madmen took control of the government.
[02:11:59.635 --> 02:12:08.842]  Roberts, like the other lemmings who appeared with him on Sunday, believe Bush's spying program is useless now because it was illegal and questionable in value.
[02:12:10.063 --> 02:12:14.670]  He and others blame the press for making the program public.
[02:12:14.690 --> 02:12:19.477]  In other words, we're the terrorists who threaten the absolute rule of the president.
[02:12:20.158 --> 02:12:23.423]  The man, Robert says, is above the law.
[02:12:24.216 --> 02:12:33.303]  As one of those who broke the story about Bush using the government to spy on Americans, oh yeah, you broke it, I sincerely hope I did my part in undermining the program.
[02:12:33.683 --> 02:12:41.369]  And until W's goose-stepping goons haul me away, I will continue to do whatever I can to undermine President Bush's actions and authority.
[02:12:41.409 --> 02:12:41.749]  Why?
[02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:46.793]  Because I'm an American, or at least I was when there was still an America left to defend.
[02:12:47.053 --> 02:12:48.594]  Yeah, Doug Thompson has done a lot of good reporting.
[02:12:49.334 --> 02:12:53.037]  We detailed in my first films the government spying on the American people.
[02:12:53.477 --> 02:12:55.059]  None of it is secret or hidden.
[02:12:56.380 --> 02:13:03.725]  I will point everyone who in this sleight of hand has missed it to section 213, 215 of the USA Patriot Act passed October 27, 2001.
[02:13:04.025 --> 02:13:06.467]  It says, for any reason, any misdemeanor,
[02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:41.453]  Any threat of a misdemeanor, any belief that a misdemeanor may have been committed, that no warrants shall be issued, they don't need warrants, that they can have these administrative subpoenas issued by the agencies themselves as rubber stamps, as basically a letter, like Caesar's minions would give letters to their functionaries, who would then go out with, you know, I have the letter from the king, I have the letter from the emperor, I have the letter from the supreme ruler,
[02:13:42.765 --> 02:13:46.006]  And they go out and they do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[02:13:46.406 --> 02:13:56.229]  And I guess this is an article we need to write where we show where they've been spying on the American people, or we show where they've been violating citizens' rights, or we show where they've been using the Patriot Act against everybody and their dog.
[02:13:57.209 --> 02:14:03.111]  And then we can parallel where there's this mindless debate about foreign calls to the U.S.
[02:14:04.571 --> 02:14:07.552]  They take the most innocuous, smallest area of a
[02:14:10.367 --> 02:14:20.717]  Pantheon of spy and surveillance and classical police state being set up, complete with FEMA camps, and then we have a debate about, again, the smallest part of the program.
[02:14:21.558 --> 02:14:22.479]  And that's how they do it.
[02:14:22.519 --> 02:14:26.743]  They limit the debate and scope to something that they think they can frame and shell to you.
[02:14:27.702 --> 02:14:32.026]  When it's only the sugar coating on the cyanide pill to America.
[02:14:32.326 --> 02:14:37.150]  And we've swallowed the pill, the casing is dissolving right now in our stomach, in our collective bellies.
[02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:41.814]  We better vomit it out now, now, and it already may be too late.
[02:14:43.394 --> 02:14:44.536]  So, I mean, it's happening.
[02:14:44.576 --> 02:14:49.101]  Everything that we always talked about, right out in the open, they're legitimizing it.
[02:14:49.161 --> 02:14:50.002]  We can torture.
[02:14:50.042 --> 02:14:50.763]  We can kill.
[02:14:51.023 --> 02:14:54.728]  We're going to set up a domestic federal police force that will arrest you for any reason.
[02:14:55.168 --> 02:15:00.535]  And if we say that you were, quote, disruptive, you spend a year at least in prison, in some cases five years instantly.
[02:15:02.256 --> 02:15:04.057]  All of it, and it doesn't scare me, folks.
[02:15:04.317 --> 02:15:08.519]  What scares me is not fighting it hard enough, because we're going to expose these terrorists.
[02:15:08.919 --> 02:15:12.501]  We're going to expose how they leave the borders wide open, but claim we've got to do all this to fight terrorists.
[02:15:12.781 --> 02:15:14.142]  We're going to expose how it's all a fraud.
[02:15:14.162 --> 02:15:16.583]  We're going to bring these criminals down, and their bosses.
[02:15:17.504 --> 02:15:21.125]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don NKC.
[02:15:21.185 --> 02:15:21.886]  Don, go ahead.
[02:15:22.586 --> 02:15:26.648]  Yeah, Alex, when I dialed up, I wasn't sure if you had touched upon this in the first hour.
[02:15:26.668 --> 02:15:30.530]  It sounds like you're getting geared up to talk about it right now, and I hope I'm not preempting this.
[02:15:31.471 --> 02:15:33.372]  I've had to do with Dick Cheney this weekend.
[02:15:34.812 --> 02:15:47.437]  Are you suspecting that perhaps this actually took place on a military reservation and may have been an example of one of these infamous human safari type things such as Kathy O'Brien talked about in Transformation of America?
[02:15:47.477 --> 02:15:50.878]  You know, unfortunately, much of what Kathy
[02:15:53.297 --> 02:16:01.099]  And her associate have talked about Kathy O'Brien and her associate have discussed has not been proven.
[02:16:01.539 --> 02:16:09.782]  But none of it's been disproven and then every time I learn more information first hand it mirrors what they alleged over a decade ago.
[02:16:09.802 --> 02:16:13.303]  And I know that Cheney literally hunts two or three days a week.
[02:16:13.323 --> 02:16:14.363]  The guy's obsessed with it.
[02:16:15.323 --> 02:16:21.805]  I don't know if what they're saying is true but Dick Cheney reportedly hunts people
[02:16:22.868 --> 02:16:24.990]  And I don't know if that's true.
[02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.951]  Do they devil worship?
[02:16:26.991 --> 02:16:27.291]  Yes.
[02:16:27.431 --> 02:16:30.494]  Do they bring in male prostitutes at the White House?
[02:16:30.534 --> 02:16:30.834]  Yes.
[02:16:31.334 --> 02:16:32.955]  Male porn stars at Bohemian Grove?
[02:16:32.975 --> 02:16:33.336]  Yes.
[02:16:34.436 --> 02:16:40.901]  Do dead people turn up on Bush properties almost on a monthly basis from Florida to the Carolinas to Maine?
[02:16:41.261 --> 02:16:41.661]  Yes.
[02:16:42.182 --> 02:16:44.123]  Is weird stuff going on constantly?
[02:16:44.163 --> 02:16:44.443]  Yes.
[02:16:44.503 --> 02:16:45.704]  Would I put anything past them?
[02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:46.024]  No.
[02:16:46.385 --> 02:16:48.006]  Have elites hunted people in the past?
[02:16:48.106 --> 02:16:48.466]  Yes.
[02:16:49.547 --> 02:16:51.108]  But this MO looks like no.
[02:16:51.148 --> 02:16:52.269]  He was just out hunting.
[02:16:53.183 --> 02:16:55.465]  I didn't hear about it until this morning, actually.
[02:17:16.065 --> 02:17:24.371]  I had heard in the report that the military people personnel were present, and I don't know if that's normal for him, those security details.
[02:17:24.471 --> 02:17:26.793]  So, things like that were getting me to wonder.
[02:17:27.493 --> 02:17:29.315]  Where did you hear the military was present?
[02:17:29.635 --> 02:17:32.557]  I think it was on a CNN report perhaps, or I can't remember.
[02:17:32.677 --> 02:17:33.958]  Maybe it was Rush Limbaugh.
[02:17:34.859 --> 02:17:37.681]  Well, if somebody will send it to me, I'll check it out.
[02:17:37.701 --> 02:17:38.881]  I wasn't aware the military was there.
[02:17:38.901 --> 02:17:40.903]  I thought it was Secret Service.
[02:17:40.923 --> 02:17:42.984]  I don't know, South Texas or Ranch.
[02:17:43.124 --> 02:17:43.725]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.721 --> 02:17:53.064]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:17:53.304 --> 02:17:58.306]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:17:58.626 --> 02:18:06.530]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:18:06.690 --> 02:18:13.733]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:18:13.953 --> 02:18:15.174]  There are no side effects.
[02:18:15.314 --> 02:18:18.697]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:18:18.757 --> 02:18:19.879]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:18:20.159 --> 02:18:21.440]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:28.487]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:52.274]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:52.734 --> 02:19:00.520]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:08.705]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:09.025 --> 02:19:13.787]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:14.107 --> 02:19:18.829]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:19.329 --> 02:19:23.191]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:19:23.691 --> 02:19:24.692]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:19:55.752 --> 02:20:04.780]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:05.240]  I think?
[02:20:20.129 --> 02:20:26.951]  Black Berkey elements flow 1.5 to 2 times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[02:21:15.544 --> 02:21:16.965]  Their mysterious symbols.
[02:21:17.305 --> 02:21:18.826]  Their hidden language.
[02:21:19.466 --> 02:21:20.326]  Encyclopedic.
[02:21:20.927 --> 02:21:21.527]  Documented.
[02:21:21.807 --> 02:21:25.909]  Codex Magicka unmask a conspiracy of immense evil.

[02:21:36.418 --> 02:21:38.620]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:40.301]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:02.162]  Good news, New Mexico is getting very close to openly denouncing aspartame.
[02:22:02.542 --> 02:22:07.663]  It's in now thousands of foods and drinks as being deadly poisonous.
[02:22:07.683 --> 02:22:08.784]  A lot of other news coming up.
[02:22:08.804 --> 02:22:13.185]  We're going to have open phones for the next 35 minutes that we've got left in this live Monday edition.
[02:22:13.765 --> 02:22:20.307]  Right now, here's a newscast that we can analyze and comment on, talking about Cheney shooting one of his hunting buddies.
[02:22:20.867 --> 02:22:21.608]  Go ahead and roll that.
[02:22:28.650 --> 02:22:35.813]  Vice President Dick Cheney took aim at a quail but instead shot a prominent Texas lawyer during a hunting trip this weekend.
[02:22:36.353 --> 02:22:39.174]  Ranch owner Catherine Armstrong saw it all happen.
[02:22:39.534 --> 02:22:40.415]  A bird flushed.
[02:22:41.235 --> 02:22:51.659]  The vice president took aim at the bird and shot and unfortunately Mr. Whittington was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty well.
[02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:58.162]  Armstrong says that 78-year-old Harry Whittington was rejoining the hunting party on her family's Texas ranch
[02:22:58.681 --> 02:22:59.322]  Unannounced!
[02:22:59.822 --> 02:23:05.647]  When the Vice President turned to shoot a quail and instead sprayed Whittington's right side with shotgun pellets.
[02:23:06.147 --> 02:23:10.290]  I could tell from my vantage point that Mr. Whittington was alert.
[02:23:10.611 --> 02:23:14.874]  He was communicating with the people offering him medical assistance.
[02:23:15.354 --> 02:23:18.977]  That he was not unconscious or anything like that.
[02:23:19.418 --> 02:23:23.641]  Whittington is listed in stable condition at the Chris Dispo Memorial Hospital.
[02:23:23.941 --> 02:23:26.103]  He has injuries to the cheek, neck and chest.
[02:23:26.738 --> 02:23:34.825]  The Vice President is an avid hunter and a supporter of the National Rifle Association and this is not the first time a hunting trip of his has made the news.
[02:23:35.546 --> 02:23:46.876]  He also made headlines in 2004 when he took Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia duck hunting while the court was considering a case filed against the Vice President by environmental groups.
[02:23:49.315 --> 02:23:54.720]  The Vice President's office didn't report the shooting publicly until almost 24 hours after it happened.
[02:23:55.221 --> 02:23:58.945]  No word on why it was not mentioned until it was reported by a local newspaper.
[02:23:59.485 --> 02:24:01.607]  Maya Kalicki, ABC News, Washington.
[02:24:02.748 --> 02:24:04.510]  A lot of different issues there.
[02:24:05.391 --> 02:24:06.672]  Number one, that is suspicious.
[02:24:06.692 --> 02:24:09.895]  They're saying 18 to 20 hours depending on what report you look at.
[02:24:10.576 --> 02:24:12.939]  But eyewitnesses have said in the White House's own
[02:24:14.222 --> 02:24:32.267]  The vice president's own press secretary has said, in fact I can find the quote here, that a quail came up out of the bush and flew over the vice president and he followed the bird to where Mr. Whittington was coming up behind the hunting party.
[02:24:33.847 --> 02:24:39.269]  And that Dick Cheney fired and shot him from 30 yards away with a 28 gauge shotgun.
[02:24:39.889 --> 02:24:40.909]  You talk about a pop gun.
[02:24:41.970 --> 02:24:43.171]  And good for Whittington.
[02:24:43.191 --> 02:24:44.832]  Boy, a 12-gauge one really killed him.
[02:24:45.333 --> 02:24:46.693]  Especially if they had a larger shot.
[02:24:46.794 --> 02:24:49.155]  It was a really small bird shot with the tiny BBs.
[02:24:50.976 --> 02:24:52.778]  And none of this makes any sense.
[02:24:53.538 --> 02:24:57.041]  Number one, it's normal that as you shoot birds, you move on in one direction.
[02:24:57.401 --> 02:25:00.683]  People are lined up just a few feet apart from each other.
[02:25:00.983 --> 02:25:04.826]  You only fire out in front of you.
[02:25:05.746 --> 02:25:09.187]  You never fire to the side, and you never fire in back of you.
[02:25:09.767 --> 02:25:23.931]  And the White House's own press release says that Dick Cheney followed the bird and then fired Mr. Whittington, the prominent Austin lawyer, who was walking up behind with a bird that he had already shot with his dog.
[02:25:24.711 --> 02:25:25.771]  I mean, that's completely normal.
[02:25:25.851 --> 02:25:29.192]  You shoot your bird, everybody moves on, and you stay behind them.
[02:25:30.352 --> 02:25:33.253]  But they spin it into how he came up unannounced!
[02:25:34.219 --> 02:25:35.060]  Unannounced?
[02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:36.721]  I mean, what does that even mean?
[02:25:37.822 --> 02:25:39.983]  It's just crazy.
[02:25:41.164 --> 02:25:42.345]  It's totally insane.
[02:25:45.569 --> 02:25:47.870]  And then they spin it that it's the Second Amendment's fault.
[02:25:47.890 --> 02:25:54.492]  There's that little comment of, you know, Navit's a supporter of the National Rifle Association.
[02:25:55.093 --> 02:26:08.018]  Well, we had Bob Barr on about a month and a half ago, former member of Congress on the NRA board, National Rifle Association board member, and he said Bush has been more anti-gun than Bill Clinton was and works for the Second Amendment.
[02:26:08.678 --> 02:26:11.279]  And all of the examples and proof of that is Legion, but
[02:26:13.971 --> 02:26:18.996]  So it implies he somehow is pro-gun and also implies that, well, look what guns cause.
[02:26:20.117 --> 02:26:25.121]  Interesting little propaganda piece that we just aired, but I am glad that they mentioned that it was almost 24 hours.
[02:26:25.802 --> 02:26:28.024]  I guess 18 to 20 you could say is almost 24 hours.
[02:26:28.464 --> 02:26:30.025]  That is a long time.
[02:26:31.287 --> 02:26:37.252]  I mean, normally on the news if there's a hunting accident outside Austin, you hear about it on KLBJ radio in about an hour.
[02:26:38.337 --> 02:26:41.539]  And of course, that's a good area for hunting down there in South Texas.
[02:26:41.959 --> 02:26:47.241]  I took him to nearby Corpus Christi near Port Aransas, one of my haunts down there.
[02:26:47.261 --> 02:26:48.282]  I like to go fishing down there.
[02:26:48.822 --> 02:26:51.303]  So I guess if I'm down there, I've even gone hog hunting down there.
[02:26:51.723 --> 02:26:53.944]  I've even been bird hunting down there, not on this ranch.
[02:26:53.984 --> 02:26:59.427]  I better watch out next time I'm out walking along through the scrub brush and Dick Cheney might pop out.
[02:27:00.687 --> 02:27:02.108]  Run at me with a shotgun.
[02:27:02.669 --> 02:27:04.770]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:16.316]  But frankly, compared to Bush declaring he has imperial powers, and talk of how they're going to bomb Iran, and the Patriot Act about to be reauthorized and expanded this week, it really isn't that important.
[02:27:17.216 --> 02:27:19.117]  We'll come back and go straight to your calls.
[02:27:19.217 --> 02:27:22.419]  David, Chris, Matt, Mike, Dave, everybody else.

[02:27:40.133 --> 02:27:42.817]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.454 --> 02:27:51.095]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[02:27:51.155 --> 02:27:51.875]  have diabetes.
[02:27:52.215 --> 02:27:59.136]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[02:27:59.296 --> 02:28:03.817]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[02:28:04.017 --> 02:28:06.838]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[02:28:49.261 --> 02:28:54.203]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.443 --> 02:28:58.805]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[02:29:17.452 --> 02:29:24.194]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[02:30:40.671 --> 02:30:42.232]  David and Mash, welcome shirt.
[02:31:05.632 --> 02:31:05.912]  Hello.
[02:31:06.312 --> 02:31:06.553]  Yes.
[02:31:07.493 --> 02:31:07.773]  Yes.
[02:31:07.793 --> 02:31:11.555]  You know, I love listening to your show and everything.
[02:31:11.855 --> 02:31:15.217]  I wanted to tell you, I read a book called The New Economic Disorder.
[02:31:15.237 --> 02:31:16.878]  I don't know if you're familiar with it.
[02:31:17.258 --> 02:31:17.459]  No.
[02:31:18.319 --> 02:31:21.361]  I read the book and in the back, I don't know if you're familiar with Larry Bates.
[02:31:21.741 --> 02:31:22.861]  I guess he has a show and everything.
[02:31:23.802 --> 02:31:24.362]  Not really.
[02:31:24.763 --> 02:31:25.023]  Okay.
[02:31:25.043 --> 02:31:27.024]  Well, anyway, you know, I said, well, great.
[02:31:27.144 --> 02:31:29.625]  You know, it's, it's on the New World Order and so forth.
[02:31:29.645 --> 02:31:32.787]  And I read the book cause I'm kind of, I'm a fan of all these things and I really,
[02:31:33.827 --> 02:31:45.632]  You know, I listen to you a lot, and a lot of different people, but I was listening to this, and as I listened to them, it really deceived me, because what they do is they started talking about things, and they were talking about the... Oh yeah, I know who he is.
[02:31:45.712 --> 02:31:46.992]  I must have had a mental block.
[02:31:47.052 --> 02:31:54.315]  He attacks me all the time, and Bush isn't Skull and Bones, and Bohemian Grove doesn't exist, and Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[02:31:54.655 --> 02:31:59.397]  He has a little radio show called Unraveling the New World Order, and I mean, I've heard it.
[02:31:59.437 --> 02:32:03.159]  They've attacked me, and he literally sits there,
[02:32:03.892 --> 02:32:11.274]  And talks all about the New World Order, and then says the heads of the New World Order are fighting the New World Order, and it's just mindless.
[02:32:12.655 --> 02:32:22.598]  I'll tell you one thing that really gets me, and that is, the minute I started, they were talking about the Patriot Act, and how that, you know, they're against the Patriot Act, and they're really coming out, and I'm like, okay, I'm listening to this, okay, that's good.
[02:32:23.098 --> 02:32:32.261]  And then all of a sudden they started saying, well, you know what, you know, the only thing that, they had a few Senators that block it, a new one out of New Hampshire, they put it through now, and
[02:32:32.933 --> 02:32:37.955]  And they're saying, well, you know, it's too bad that the President was for that.
[02:32:38.396 --> 02:32:40.817]  But I think he just got a lot of... It's not really his fault.
[02:32:41.137 --> 02:32:43.478]  He got some bad advisors like the Attorney General.
[02:32:44.038 --> 02:32:46.719]  I forget the Attorney General's name, but... Alberto Gonzales.
[02:32:46.739 --> 02:32:49.901]  Yeah, he said it's Alberto Gonzales' fault, it's not Bush's fault.
[02:32:49.941 --> 02:32:51.382]  And we got all these Evangelicals.
[02:32:51.402 --> 02:32:52.782]  And I'm a Christian Evangelical.
[02:32:52.902 --> 02:32:56.484]  What it is, is mindless apologists.
[02:32:57.877 --> 02:33:01.842]  Mindless apologists who just get up there.
[02:33:02.482 --> 02:33:03.704]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:33:03.864 --> 02:33:06.647]  I remember those guys, four years ago, really went after me.
[02:33:07.007 --> 02:33:12.433]  When nobody was saying 9-11 was an inside job, I was obviously said it before it even happened and the day it happened.
[02:33:12.914 --> 02:33:18.941]  And then I had FBI agents on, I had David Shippers on, I would have transcripts of it, I'd have the documents, where Bush
[02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:26.289]  Ordered the FBI and the NSA and the CIA not to stop the Al-Qaeda operations in the U.S.
[02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:29.734]  and it was in the BBC and Bush signed W1999.
[02:33:29.774 --> 02:33:30.915]  We got one page of it.
[02:33:30.935 --> 02:33:32.037]  That's all Greg Powell can get.
[02:33:32.678 --> 02:33:34.700]  And they just got on air and just said it's not true.
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.682]  Jones is making it up.
[02:33:36.329 --> 02:33:39.410]  And they'd go, because I sent clips of it, Alex, where's that document?
[02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:40.170]  Hmm?
[02:33:40.891 --> 02:33:41.571]  He won't show it.
[02:33:41.611 --> 02:33:42.331]  He won't debate it.
[02:33:42.351 --> 02:33:44.652]  So I called up and I said, OK, I'll debate you.
[02:33:44.672 --> 02:33:45.212]  I'll come on.
[02:33:45.272 --> 02:33:46.172]  I'll send it all to you.
[02:33:46.613 --> 02:33:47.973]  No, that's all right, Mr. Jones.
[02:33:47.993 --> 02:33:51.994]  Then later, I was still refusing to come on with them according to their show.
[02:33:52.014 --> 02:33:55.435]  Everybody knows I'll debate anybody any time if they're not a stalker.
[02:33:55.455 --> 02:33:59.697]  There's a few stalkers who try to get me to get into arguments with them, but I avoid them.
[02:34:00.578 --> 02:34:07.323]  But, so, so, I mean, how do you respond to somebody and Alex is making it up saying there was prior knowledge?
[02:34:07.363 --> 02:34:08.463]  Well, I didn't say prior knowledge.
[02:34:08.483 --> 02:34:09.544]  I said they were involved in it.
[02:34:09.904 --> 02:34:11.285]  A lot more than prior knowledge.
[02:34:11.305 --> 02:34:12.706]  Please don't limit what I'm saying.
[02:34:12.726 --> 02:34:14.187]  I'm saying much more.
[02:34:14.868 --> 02:34:17.550]  And, uh, you know, he's just making it all up.
[02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:28.217]  And this thing about Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones, it's just of the devil him to say that and bearing false witness against a man of the Lord, George W.
[02:34:31.966 --> 02:34:33.697]  I mean, nobody pays attention to those guys.
[02:34:33.717 --> 02:34:34.320]  Who cares?
[02:34:35.123 --> 02:34:36.684]  I mean, they got a problem, see?
[02:34:37.284 --> 02:34:39.325]  Bush signs on to UNESCO and the U.N.
[02:34:39.365 --> 02:34:42.766]  and, oh, Bush didn't mean it, he just has bad advisors.
[02:34:42.846 --> 02:34:47.388]  And, oh, Bush is going after the Second Amendment and he wants to assault his man.
[02:34:47.708 --> 02:34:49.189]  He's just got bad advisors.
[02:34:49.249 --> 02:34:52.651]  And Bush just spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[02:34:52.671 --> 02:34:54.131]  He's just got bad advisors.
[02:34:54.191 --> 02:35:00.414]  And, um, Bush wants total amnesty for all illegal aliens and to bring in skilled and unskilled workers at unlimited levels.
[02:35:01.114 --> 02:35:02.715]  He's just got bad advisors.
[02:35:03.622 --> 02:35:05.723]  But we ought to be thankful for shows like that.
[02:35:05.743 --> 02:35:10.245]  Then you've got the neocon shows where we've really got to do something about the borders.
[02:35:11.105 --> 02:35:15.507]  These evil liberals, they're holding Bush back from securing them.
[02:35:16.227 --> 02:35:20.789]  Meanwhile, the Democrats wrote the bills that Bush is promoting and are with him on total amnesty.
[02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:24.611]  I mean, I've heard Sean Hannity talk one time in my car.
[02:35:24.631 --> 02:35:25.431]  I was sitting there.
[02:35:25.851 --> 02:35:29.533]  I should have gone into the office, but they re-air him here locally in the evening.
[02:35:30.873 --> 02:35:31.293]  And I'm there.
[02:35:31.313 --> 02:35:32.954]  It was actually in San Antonio.
[02:35:34.045 --> 02:35:34.585]  It doesn't matter.
[02:35:34.806 --> 02:35:39.949]  The point is, I'm sitting there listening to it, and I had a meeting I had to get into, but I just couldn't quit listening, because I knew it!
[02:35:40.970 --> 02:35:46.514]  For a whole segment, the border's wide open, it's a war zone, it's horrible, everything's falling apart, we've got to do something about it.
[02:35:47.434 --> 02:35:58.682]  And I knew it was coming, I just knew what he was going to say, and then after about 15 minutes, we've got to get Bush's plan passed that's not amnesty, it's a guest worker program, but the liberals are blocking it!
[02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:04.352]  Well, he was counting on people not looking up the fact that the Democrats introduced it!
[02:36:05.972 --> 02:36:07.193]  So, this is what they'll do.
[02:36:07.213 --> 02:36:13.575]  They'll tell you about a big problem, and then give you their solution, which is, oh man, you know, you're in the frying pan.
[02:36:13.595 --> 02:36:15.475]  We need to throw you into the furnace.
[02:36:15.615 --> 02:36:17.416]  You know, you're getting burned in the frying pan.
[02:36:17.716 --> 02:36:19.277]  Here, let us stick you in the oven.
[02:36:19.297 --> 02:36:22.818]  Let us stick you in a crematorium.
[02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:27.812]  You know, oh, it's a hot summer day, you're sweating.
[02:36:27.852 --> 02:36:31.574]  Here, let's teleport you to the center of the sun.
[02:36:31.914 --> 02:36:33.355]  That'll fix your problems.
[02:36:34.476 --> 02:36:40.359]  And so then I'm having debates with neocons going, no, President Bush has got a plan for the borders, Alex.
[02:36:40.379 --> 02:36:41.440]  I appreciate him.
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:42.180]  That's how they talk.
[02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:44.582]  And I'm like, no, it's a total amnesty plan.
[02:36:44.602 --> 02:36:45.042]  Here's the bill.
[02:36:45.342 --> 02:36:46.903]  Shut up, liberal commie.
[02:36:47.523 --> 02:36:49.945]  Well, no, actually, I'm not a liberal commie.
[02:36:50.485 --> 02:36:51.346]  Yeah, you are.
[02:36:51.586 --> 02:36:53.267]  Back off right now, boy.
[02:36:55.414 --> 02:36:56.155]  I mean, that's how they act.
[02:36:56.175 --> 02:36:58.556]  They just feel so good as America goes down.
[02:36:58.596 --> 02:37:06.840]  And they're just riding around with their W stickers, smiling at each other, and plastic flags made in China by slaves, flapping, tattered on their vehicles, desecrated.
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:08.321]  And they just love it.
[02:37:08.801 --> 02:37:09.722]  They love being idiots.
[02:37:10.382 --> 02:37:12.203]  They love the troops having bad body armor.
[02:37:12.223 --> 02:37:14.224]  They love the troops having to pay for their own flights home.
[02:37:14.684 --> 02:37:15.145]  They love it.
[02:37:15.165 --> 02:37:15.745]  I've interviewed them.
[02:37:16.943 --> 02:37:19.245]  Just bringing it up is not supporting the troops.
[02:37:19.525 --> 02:37:23.608]  You're just trying to undermine the war with liberal commie lies!
[02:37:24.068 --> 02:37:25.529]  Back off before I punch you!
[02:37:26.029 --> 02:37:27.590]  Officer, get him away from me!
[02:37:27.810 --> 02:37:29.892]  Well, no, aren't you willing to debate the facts with me, sir?
[02:37:30.292 --> 02:37:31.713]  Shut up right now!
[02:37:31.733 --> 02:37:33.294]  And I've got them on video.
[02:37:33.794 --> 02:37:37.317]  We've got to take some of those clips from the new film I'm making and start putting them on the radio.
[02:37:37.357 --> 02:37:38.658]  We will do that before it comes out.
[02:37:39.258 --> 02:37:44.702]  We've got probably 50 of these people and we're about to go out and do more interviews on the streets.
[02:37:45.002 --> 02:37:46.683]  And by the way, we don't have to go find them.
[02:37:47.227 --> 02:37:52.451]  I mean, you can just walk up to random neocons getting out of cars with W stickers, and they're in la-la land!
[02:37:52.491 --> 02:37:53.812]  They don't know which ends up!
[02:37:53.852 --> 02:37:54.433]  They don't know!
[02:37:54.653 --> 02:38:00.137]  We're losing the Second Amendment, and Republican governors are suing gun manufacturers, and they're shutting their doors every month.
[02:38:00.418 --> 02:38:08.785]  Another company shuts its doors that I see, and the economy's falling apart, and Bush is doing all this, and doubling the size on average of all these big socialist government agencies.
[02:38:09.325 --> 02:38:13.889]  They have no idea, and you tell them it's just, you're a liar, boy!
[02:38:15.207 --> 02:38:16.636]  Invincible ignorance.
[02:38:16.918 --> 02:38:18.367]  Willful mindlessness.
[02:38:20.382 --> 02:38:21.743]  And the Democrats aren't much better.
[02:38:21.783 --> 02:38:38.674]  You're like, well, hey, actually, the Democrats are predominantly for the war and even want to invade Iran, and they're for the, quote, privatization, handing over the government to these private corporations, and they're for all these toll roads, and they're doing all the same stuff, and they voted with Bush for the National ID Card, and they voted with Bush for the New Freedom Initiative, or for psychological testing and drugging.
[02:38:39.114 --> 02:38:40.195]  No, no, it's not true.
[02:38:40.675 --> 02:38:43.898]  No, it's Hillary's good, and George Bush is bad.
[02:38:43.918 --> 02:38:45.759]  Well, actually, here's their voting record.
[02:38:45.779 --> 02:38:47.320]  Alex, I don't have time for that.
[02:38:49.697 --> 02:38:50.418]  Okay, good.
[02:38:50.458 --> 02:38:51.498]  Just be idiots then.
[02:38:51.558 --> 02:38:53.059]  I mean, just be a bunch of idiots.
[02:38:53.559 --> 02:38:55.460]  Alright, I said I'd take calls and I'm ranting here.
[02:38:55.961 --> 02:38:57.982]  It's just, it's admitted facts.
[02:38:59.322 --> 02:39:00.043]  They're together.
[02:39:00.083 --> 02:39:01.123]  There isn't two teams.
[02:39:01.143 --> 02:39:03.405]  There's one team and they're beating the daylights out of us.
[02:39:04.725 --> 02:39:09.448]  And until we figure out that it's one team, people don't even know who's attacking them or what's happening.
[02:39:10.234 --> 02:39:15.076]  My job is just to get people to just... You don't have to believe me, neocons, please, okay?
[02:39:15.396 --> 02:39:17.417]  Okay, I'm probably a dirty commie, okay?
[02:39:17.457 --> 02:39:19.717]  And probably the cousin of Stalin.
[02:39:20.078 --> 02:39:20.638]  That's a joke.
[02:39:20.698 --> 02:39:22.939]  There will be websites saying I admit I'm the cousin of Stalin.
[02:39:23.179 --> 02:39:23.979]  That's a joke.
[02:39:29.021 --> 02:39:32.182]  But it's just so frustrating.
[02:39:32.342 --> 02:39:34.203]  It's so frustrating.
[02:39:35.783 --> 02:39:38.044]  Most people don't look at politics
[02:39:39.108 --> 02:39:44.651]  According to the facts and what's going on in the world, and according to the yardstick, does it give me more liberty or less liberty?
[02:39:46.532 --> 02:39:49.714]  They look at it as, what supports the view I already have?
[02:39:49.774 --> 02:40:05.502]  And they have that big Emory University brain scan study in 2004-2005, and it admits that Democrats, when they hear something they don't like about their own party, automatically shut off the thinking process in the cerebral cortex and the dorsal sides,
[02:40:08.018 --> 02:40:33.881]  Jimmy left or so side and then they will automatically then reward themselves for shutting down and they'll be in a pleasure center activation Republicans do the same thing and that's not how people normally operate you've been conditioned for television which admittedly is designed to brainwash you not just with the content but with the flicker right now it's presented in the the whole nine yards I mean this is what the TV the TV execs spend more time paying for that they do for producing shows
[02:40:34.514 --> 02:40:37.957]  They all are fighting with each other to have the latest brainwashing techniques.
[02:40:38.538 --> 02:40:39.278]  It's all published.
[02:40:39.298 --> 02:40:39.959]  It's all admitted.
[02:40:40.199 --> 02:40:43.362]  The average person has no idea that's even going on.
[02:40:43.382 --> 02:40:45.544]  And they do that.
[02:40:45.584 --> 02:40:47.445]  I mean, people decide.
[02:40:47.485 --> 02:40:50.068]  They think it's like an argument of who's going to win it.
[02:40:51.209 --> 02:40:58.295]  They think, a lot of people think, when you tell them about how the world really works, they think you're showing off or that you're trying to act like they're dumb or
[02:41:00.481 --> 02:41:07.751]  I mean, I've had... I've been out there debating neocons, and I go, well, you know... I'll say, you know, our government's staged terror attacks before to get us into wars.
[02:41:08.231 --> 02:41:11.656]  And I go, it's now declassified, the Gulf of Tonkin was totally staged.
[02:41:11.816 --> 02:41:12.897]  Oh, you're a liar, shut up!
[02:41:13.398 --> 02:41:14.920]  It's now admitted the Northwoods document.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.082]  Oh, you're a liar, shut up!
[02:41:16.822 --> 02:41:20.843]  It's now admitted that the FBI cooked the bomb and turned the driver in the first World Trade Center attack.
[02:41:20.883 --> 02:41:21.443]  Mainstream news.
[02:41:21.543 --> 02:41:22.484]  Oh, shut up, you're a liar.
[02:41:22.864 --> 02:41:24.544]  Oklahoma City is clearly an inside job.
[02:41:24.684 --> 02:41:25.425]  Oh, you're a liar.
[02:41:26.025 --> 02:41:28.225]  And then you can use other admitted examples.
[02:41:29.246 --> 02:41:30.026]  Oh, you're a liar.
[02:41:30.106 --> 02:41:31.086]  It's not true.
[02:41:31.166 --> 02:41:33.287]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:41:33.647 --> 02:41:35.107]  Well, hey, can I give you some documents?
[02:41:35.127 --> 02:41:36.988]  This is on the Library of Congress.
[02:41:37.168 --> 02:41:38.408]  Oh, that's not real.
[02:41:38.428 --> 02:41:39.109]  Get away from me.
[02:41:39.529 --> 02:41:41.009]  But I thought you wanted to debate me.
[02:41:41.129 --> 02:41:42.229]  Ah, just shut up!
[02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:43.890]  Just shut up!
[02:41:45.723 --> 02:41:47.144]  But listen, I'm trying to warn you.
[02:41:47.525 --> 02:41:49.326]  The currency's been devalued by 45%.
[02:41:49.807 --> 02:41:50.747]  That's a lie!
[02:41:50.807 --> 02:41:51.388]  Back off!
[02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:56.272]  Bush has doubled the funding for the BATF.
[02:41:56.312 --> 02:41:57.974]  That's another lie!
[02:41:58.014 --> 02:41:59.055]  That's a lie!
[02:41:59.075 --> 02:42:01.417]  I have all this on tape.
[02:42:03.218 --> 02:42:04.679]  Well, they didn't find WMDs.
[02:42:04.739 --> 02:42:06.040]  Yes, they did.
[02:42:06.141 --> 02:42:07.362]  Yes, they did.
[02:42:07.382 --> 02:42:08.903]  No, they didn't.
[02:42:08.923 --> 02:42:09.624]  Shut up!
[02:42:13.331 --> 02:42:14.531]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[02:42:14.611 --> 02:42:15.772]  Chris in Connecticut.
[02:42:16.772 --> 02:42:17.652]  Do we just talk to David?
[02:42:19.492 --> 02:42:20.072]  Chris is next.
[02:42:20.392 --> 02:42:21.673]  Chris in Connecticut, go ahead.
[02:42:21.693 --> 02:42:23.153]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[02:42:23.193 --> 02:42:24.613]  That was a great rant, by the way.
[02:42:24.633 --> 02:42:26.814]  I don't know if it's that good.
[02:42:26.854 --> 02:42:28.474]  I can't stand listening to myself, but thank you.
[02:42:29.334 --> 02:42:30.574]  Okay, well, it's good.
[02:42:30.774 --> 02:42:32.775]  It's like good drama, you know, getting both sides.
[02:42:33.315 --> 02:42:37.056]  Well, anyway, I completely agree with you about the LaRouche business.
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:43.502]  I've been in one of their meetings, and they're always like, oh, let's learn about math and stuff.
[02:42:44.263 --> 02:42:45.844]  And that'll solve all the world's problems.
[02:42:45.884 --> 02:42:47.965]  And I try to tell them, like, you gotta know your enemy.
[02:42:47.985 --> 02:42:49.525]  These guys are really evil and all that.
[02:42:49.685 --> 02:42:52.367]  And they're kind of a useless organization.
[02:42:52.387 --> 02:42:55.408]  And I was wondering, you said you knew better organizations to get involved with?
[02:42:55.628 --> 02:42:58.410]  And so I need a good grassroots organization.
[02:42:58.450 --> 02:42:59.530]  Do you have any idea?
[02:42:59.630 --> 02:43:02.152]  Or could you point us in a direction?
[02:43:02.192 --> 02:43:04.953]  Or possibly even have one up on your site for
[02:43:06.059 --> 02:43:10.758]  Yeah, the organization is called Chris in Connecticut.
[02:43:11.574 --> 02:43:36.102]  Starting an organization, picking an issue or two, land rights, second amendment, control the borders, cut taxes, cut regulation, restrict privatization, fight toll roads, and that's really the most effective thing to do is to pick different issues and fight those and inform others and start your own website or get your own local radio show on the weekend, pay for it if you have to, show documentary films,
[02:43:37.304 --> 02:43:42.879]  I mean, there are a lot of issue-specific groups, like the Paragon Foundation for Land Rights and Private Property.
[02:43:44.073 --> 02:43:48.715]  There's Gun Owners of America, or Jews Preservation of Firearms Ownership with the Second Amendment.
[02:43:49.495 --> 02:43:50.455]  There are so many groups.
[02:43:50.495 --> 02:43:55.017]  So many of the, quote, patriot groups themselves are infiltrated or run by egomaniacs.
[02:43:55.637 --> 02:43:59.419]  I've said get involved in the John Birch Society, but they never really get anything done.
[02:43:59.479 --> 02:44:04.600]  And their centralized, kind of their own little politburo never really has their people do anything.
[02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:06.421]  Though there was just a big shake-up there.
[02:44:06.621 --> 02:44:08.682]  Supposedly it might be going in the right direction, but I don't know.
[02:44:09.335 --> 02:44:11.096]  Yeah, I've been searching for somebody brave.
[02:44:11.176 --> 02:44:14.959]  Like, obviously you're brave and you can speak out, but you've got your radio show.
[02:44:14.979 --> 02:44:18.381]  You know, I don't really believe in leaderless resistance.
[02:44:18.481 --> 02:44:22.724]  I believe in different cadres of people in different areas engaging in the info war.
[02:44:24.105 --> 02:44:28.188]  See, I don't want to be anybody's leader, and I don't want to sit here and tell everybody what to do or how to do it.
[02:44:28.248 --> 02:44:32.611]  Our strength comes from all of us in lone wolf capacities going out and waking up others.
[02:44:34.292 --> 02:44:35.793]  Well, you certainly have good common sense.
[02:44:37.575 --> 02:44:39.076]  Well, I mean, I appreciate that.
[02:44:39.096 --> 02:44:40.056]  I try to have common sense.
[02:44:40.116 --> 02:44:43.617]  I appreciate your call, and I'm flattered that you're asking me for organizations.
[02:44:44.938 --> 02:44:46.018]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:44:46.778 --> 02:44:51.340]  There are a lot of people who, under my banner, run around claiming they're Alex Jones or affiliated with me.
[02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.941]  And if you don't hear me saying they're affiliated with me, chances are they're not.
[02:44:55.621 --> 02:44:59.943]  Or if you don't hear me endorsing them on this broadcast, if you respect my opinion and views of people.
[02:45:00.803 --> 02:45:04.985]  And then there's other stuff where people, you know, move into this area.
[02:45:05.005 --> 02:45:06.285]  Some of them I like, some of them I don't.
[02:45:07.091 --> 02:45:17.055]  Move into this area and bivouac themselves here and then try to go around duplicating everything I do while alienating everyone and bad-mouthing me to them.
[02:45:17.995 --> 02:45:19.515]  And boy, that's really frustrating.
[02:45:20.056 --> 02:45:24.937]  Because people don't associate me from somebody else they hear on, say, the same local station here.
[02:45:25.558 --> 02:45:29.019]  They don't know there's two different networks, in some cases three different networks being fed on there.
[02:45:29.539 --> 02:45:34.681]  And so, you know, when they hear all these preposterous pronunciations and pronouncements,
[02:45:37.382 --> 02:45:39.404]  So there's a lot of stuff there.
[02:45:40.425 --> 02:45:45.509]  It's very frustrating, and I don't endorse all this get out of debt schemes that you hear places.
[02:45:45.529 --> 02:45:49.592]  I don't endorse all the magical cures, the super products.
[02:45:50.112 --> 02:45:56.918]  I mean, I endorse the vitamins and real things like that, but just anything that says it's magical or cure-all, I don't like being associated with all that.
[02:45:57.158 --> 02:46:00.841]  We need the good people out there that are involved, yourselves, to be leaders.
[02:46:01.321 --> 02:46:03.403]  And to not count on somebody else to do it for you.
[02:46:03.703 --> 02:46:07.747]  I probably get 50 calls a day telling me, I need to do this, I need to do that, I need to cover this more.
[02:46:07.767 --> 02:46:09.808]  You can write a book about this, make a video about that.
[02:46:10.069 --> 02:46:11.310]  Hey, you guys need to.
[02:46:11.350 --> 02:46:12.090]  You're the leaders.
[02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:12.531]  Believe me.
[02:46:12.831 --> 02:46:13.792]  You've got the power.
[02:46:13.892 --> 02:46:18.496]  It's women and men and old ladies and young men and black men and white people.
[02:46:18.576 --> 02:46:19.457]  It's everywhere.
[02:46:19.837 --> 02:46:24.381]  Beating the Patriot Act at their level, beating land grabs, beating toll roads, exposing things.
[02:46:24.601 --> 02:46:26.703]  We have victories all the time if you'll just get involved.
[02:46:27.563 --> 02:46:29.245]  Which you are getting involved, so I commend you.
[02:46:29.865 --> 02:46:32.307]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Michigan.
[02:46:32.347 --> 02:46:32.928]  Go ahead, Matt.
[02:46:33.488 --> 02:46:34.489]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:46:34.589 --> 02:46:34.930]  You bet.
[02:46:35.550 --> 02:46:36.191]  I just have a question.
[02:46:36.211 --> 02:46:44.338]  It really seems like the template for launching these simultaneous major theater wars, as PNAC calls it, is to arm our enemies and then disarm them forcefully.
[02:46:44.898 --> 02:46:52.005]  We saw it in Iraq when we gave them chemical weapons throughout the 80s, and Rumsfeld on the board of ABB when we armed North Korea with the light water reactors.
[02:46:52.625 --> 02:46:54.647]  And Hamas, of course, is the creation of Israel, but
[02:46:55.347 --> 02:46:58.848]  Not away, that's in Israel's own newspapers, that's not your opinion.
[02:46:59.229 --> 02:47:02.650]  Right, and the UPI reported that too, I believe, I don't remember.
[02:47:03.970 --> 02:47:07.892]  My question to you is, as far as Iran goes, is there a similar situation, maybe not exactly?
[02:47:07.932 --> 02:47:09.753]  Yes, British and Israeli and U.S.
[02:47:09.773 --> 02:47:15.035]  companies sold them most of the nuclear equipment along with Russia, and that's all over the news.
[02:47:16.895 --> 02:47:18.296]  Past news articles, now you won't hear it.
[02:47:18.737 --> 02:47:21.798]  The article, I think DTI, a major firm over there in Britain, did that.
[02:47:21.878 --> 02:47:23.179]  Yeah, that's BBC headline, yeah.
[02:47:23.379 --> 02:47:28.321]  And I think Steve Watson... Headline, British firm gave Iran key nuclear components.
[02:47:28.341 --> 02:47:28.641]  Go ahead.
[02:47:29.121 --> 02:47:36.605]  Yeah, I was just going to say, Steve Watson, you know, one of your workers, he wrote a really good article about that with Kissinger supporting a lot of that.
[02:47:36.645 --> 02:47:44.508]  It was, I don't remember exactly what it was, but he kind of detailed the history behind it, and I was just curious if, like you said, maybe recent companies were continuing that also.
[02:47:44.568 --> 02:47:46.569]  It's always the same, brother.
[02:47:47.242 --> 02:47:47.462]  Amen.
[02:47:47.702 --> 02:47:48.122]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:48.362 --> 02:47:48.682]  You bet.
[02:47:48.723 --> 02:47:49.123]  And you're right.
[02:47:49.143 --> 02:47:50.543]  They follow a template.
[02:47:51.563 --> 02:47:52.344]  A shake and bake.
[02:47:52.404 --> 02:47:54.604]  It's like you go buy a box of pancake mix.
[02:47:54.664 --> 02:47:55.285]  It's the same.
[02:47:56.425 --> 02:47:57.185]  It's the same thing.
[02:47:57.485 --> 02:48:00.506]  And they'll provocateur stuff and stir up the propaganda.
[02:48:01.647 --> 02:48:05.228]  The globalists are going to have trouble attacking Iran without carrying something out here.
[02:48:05.248 --> 02:48:09.009]  And these next few months are absolutely critical right now.
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:23.009]  They're critical for some type of event here in the Western world, some type of major terrorist attack, which I guarantee you, they'll furnish lots of bug-eyed patsies to be the terrorists, and they'll never get a trial.
[02:48:23.449 --> 02:48:27.812]  And then the martial law will just go forward, and they're announcing dictatorial dictatorship powers.
[02:48:28.392 --> 02:48:31.755]  It's all happening right now in front of our little eyeballs.
[02:48:32.936 --> 02:48:34.056]  Right in front of our eyeballs.
[02:48:34.597 --> 02:48:37.579]  And of course, after the next big terror attack, if we can't expose it and stop it,
[02:48:38.371 --> 02:48:40.752]  Just don't be attacking your pension fund, not Al-Qaeda.
[02:48:41.332 --> 02:48:45.513]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:48:47.333 --> 02:48:50.174]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.434 --> 02:48:52.015]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.355 --> 02:48:57.036]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.376 --> 02:49:04.098]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.438 --> 02:49:06.399]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:09.441]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.562 --> 02:49:14.205]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.425 --> 02:49:18.808]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.068 --> 02:49:26.293]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:49:59.586 --> 02:50:04.271]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:04.731 --> 02:50:11.439]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.839 --> 02:50:23.612]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.932 --> 02:50:24.072]  Yes.
[02:50:24.092 --> 02:50:28.555]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:52:05.856 --> 02:52:11.546]  That's something you can do right there because I think, frankly, this broadcast is the most focused on the key issues of any of them out there.
[02:52:13.480 --> 02:52:23.164]  So many are just ridiculous, and a lot of others are great, but I think this broadcast brings a lot of great guests, a lot of great calls, a lot of important news, that it warrants you promoting the show, and that's how it happens.
[02:52:23.684 --> 02:52:35.809]  Whether it's on MySpace, or on message boards, or in letters to the editor, or calling into mainstream talk shows, that's why we have millions and millions of listeners and why we have millions and millions of visitors to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.

[02:52:55.482 --> 02:52:56.342]  It's won Best of Austin.
[02:52:56.903 --> 02:52:57.623]  Pretty good TV show.
[02:52:57.703 --> 02:53:01.086]  And then video interviews here in studio of the live radio interviews.
[02:53:01.546 --> 02:53:02.987]  So many new functions being added.
[02:53:03.347 --> 02:53:04.868]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[02:53:05.129 --> 02:53:06.870]  It's got to be like 500 pieces of media
[02:53:07.490 --> 02:53:09.210]  Or something now in the last two years.
[02:53:09.270 --> 02:53:10.011]  Coming up in a month.
[02:53:10.331 --> 02:53:13.311]  It'll be two years since we launched PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:13.751 --> 02:53:15.532]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[02:53:15.572 --> 02:53:16.032]  Go ahead.
[02:53:16.332 --> 02:53:16.812]  Hey Alex.
[02:53:17.052 --> 02:53:17.332]  Hi.
[02:53:17.592 --> 02:53:22.293]  Hey, have you ever heard of a guy by the name of John Trachman of Militia of Montana?
[02:53:22.313 --> 02:53:24.694]  Yeah, we've interviewed John in the past.
[02:53:24.714 --> 02:53:26.474]  A lot of good material, interesting information.
[02:53:26.734 --> 02:53:28.134]  Yeah, I just got something.
[02:53:28.194 --> 02:53:36.336]  He is showcasing a book by a guy by the name of Scott Gulbranson called Silent Invasion.
[02:53:37.558 --> 02:53:54.586]  And he showed some excerpts of that and basically this guy interviewed a lot of border agents and they told him that just in the one crossing at Otay Mesa in California, 20 to 30 semis, 18 wheelers, were coming across the border every day.
[02:53:55.439 --> 02:53:59.722]  Full of Chinese ammunition, Chinese guns, and all kinds of stuff.
[02:53:59.742 --> 02:54:05.325]  And this has been going on since the late... Actually, sir, I have the front page cover of the L.A.
[02:54:05.405 --> 02:54:07.166]  Times in my first film, produced in 1997.
[02:54:07.847 --> 02:54:09.107]  The article was from 1996.
[02:54:09.708 --> 02:54:13.110]  In my film, America Destroyed by Design, still available.
[02:54:13.930 --> 02:54:24.937]  We go there, and we show you, and it was entire container areas, not just one container, but whole bunches of containers, masses of them, full of rockets and AK-47s.
[02:54:25.157 --> 02:54:31.081]  Yeah, yeah, and he was saying that some of these agents have been killed because they were trying to... Oh, yes, they have.
[02:54:31.101 --> 02:54:36.665]  No, no, no, this is a New World Order takeover using Mexican and Chinese agents that work for the Pentagon.
[02:54:36.685 --> 02:54:40.127]  I mean, this is active pre-staging of Special Forces caches.
[02:54:41.112 --> 02:54:42.173]  That's what special forces do.
[02:54:42.213 --> 02:54:48.961]  They go bury caches to later be used by their operatives who will live in your society for years with normal jobs, you know, at the local pizza parlor.
[02:54:49.622 --> 02:54:50.363]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:50.403 --> 02:54:51.044]  I appreciate it.
[02:54:51.284 --> 02:54:51.945]  It's not a joke.
[02:54:51.985 --> 02:54:52.405]  It's real.
[02:54:52.966 --> 02:54:55.729]  The scope of it, people can argue about that, but it's going on.
[02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:57.832]  Pre-positioning of weapons caches.
[02:54:58.787 --> 02:55:00.808]  Dave in Connecticut, last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:00.828 --> 02:55:02.109]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:55:02.189 --> 02:55:02.569]  Good, sir.
[02:55:02.789 --> 02:55:06.772]  Listen, I picked up a broadcast last night and I'm a ham operator.
[02:55:06.792 --> 02:55:08.753]  This was on the AM broadcast band.
[02:55:08.853 --> 02:55:17.738]  I was listening to a station in Cincinnati, Ohio and they were talking about some big deal that's going down today regarding six ports in the United States.
[02:55:19.371 --> 02:55:21.652]  That was actually the news item that I was going to cover.
[02:55:22.032 --> 02:55:24.873]  Six ports are being given to the United Arab Emirates.
[02:55:25.273 --> 02:55:26.213]  They're actually the U.S.
[02:55:26.293 --> 02:55:26.753]  government.
[02:55:26.773 --> 02:55:32.095]  See, privatization is selling off predominantly to foreign companies and countries.
[02:55:32.135 --> 02:55:34.115]  And that's in my film at Long Beach.
[02:55:34.135 --> 02:55:35.196]  They gave it to the Chai Coms.
[02:55:35.236 --> 02:55:35.596]  Go ahead.
[02:55:35.876 --> 02:55:36.596]  Oh my God.
[02:55:36.756 --> 02:55:39.037]  I mean, the deal is supposed to be going down today.
[02:55:39.057 --> 02:55:40.357]  Six billion dollar deal.
[02:55:41.457 --> 02:55:47.278]  That was the final article, and look at you, I wasn't going to cover it because of time, and God must have wanted that to come out.
[02:55:47.578 --> 02:55:50.639]  Well, I hope you'll talk about it tomorrow, because it's unbelievable.
[02:55:50.699 --> 02:55:56.600]  It wasn't a big deal, given the foreign governments, all our major ports and national parks and lands.
[02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:00.761]  Did we put the Japanese in charge of our port security in World War II?
[02:56:00.801 --> 02:56:01.961]  What the hell are we doing?
[02:56:02.321 --> 02:56:03.041]  What are we doing?
[02:56:03.062 --> 02:56:04.162]  It's called an NWO.
[02:56:04.242 --> 02:56:05.582]  It's called being set up for a fall.
[02:56:05.862 --> 02:56:10.243]  Cops are busy pulling little families over and searching families with toddlers on the side of the road.
[02:56:10.956 --> 02:56:13.238]  With fire ants climbing up their legs, biting them.
[02:56:13.278 --> 02:56:14.258]  But the border's wide open.
[02:56:14.278 --> 02:56:15.499]  They're selling out the whole country, Bubba.
[02:56:15.519 --> 02:56:18.501]  In fact, I had a whole stack of news about privatization today.
[02:56:18.941 --> 02:56:20.903]  It's called looting, and I'm glad you're concerned.
[02:56:21.183 --> 02:56:22.264]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:22.304 --> 02:56:23.144]  God bless you all.
