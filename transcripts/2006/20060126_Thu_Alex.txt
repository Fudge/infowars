[00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.006]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.746]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.447 --> 00:00:09.567]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:11.027]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:12.688]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:17.090]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.631]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:23.072]  Music
[00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:31.684]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.505]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:46.750]  It is the Wednesday edition of this worldwide transmission against tyranny in defense of liberty and human dignity and control of our own personal destinies.
[00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:57.814]  Something that God Almighty saw fit to give mankind free will, the New World Disorder, the New World Dehumanization Slave Grid,
[00:00:58.414 --> 00:01:00.917]  is seeking to steal from us.
[00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:07.223]  And it is blasphemous by every definition of the word.
[00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:11.007]  France to Iran, stop nukes, then meat.
[00:01:11.448 --> 00:01:15.852]  France is getting tough and saying, maybe you need to be attacked.
[00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:19.376]  Even those liberal Frenchies.
[00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:28.977]  Iran proposes new talks with Europeans who are mostly dismissive and are saying we're the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:31.280]  Prepare to be micro-nuked.
[00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:34.825]  Israel will not allow Iran to obtain WMDs.
[00:01:38.328 --> 00:01:41.713]  And I heard Jack Blood here yesterday read a great article from Information Clearinghouse.
[00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:44.057]  It's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:44.357 --> 00:01:45.859]  More lies about Iran.
[00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:50.226]  And from all my research, this is spot on by Mike Whitney.
[00:01:51.192 --> 00:01:53.074]  I'm going to read this article in its entirety.
[00:01:53.374 --> 00:01:57.397]  Another article here out of the Hampton Spectator.
[00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:00.459]  No need to panic over Iranian nukes.
[00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.042]  I mean, folks, it really is total hysteria.
[00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:11.888]  I mean, it is a hundred times more hysterical and based in non-reality than the bird flu fiasco.
[00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.911]  But meanwhile, the new German Chancellor Merkel...
[00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:20.201]  Opposes banning Iran from the World Cup soccer.
[00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.663]  The soccer must go on.
[00:02:22.723 --> 00:02:23.825]  It's very important.
[00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:25.727]  More important than this upcoming war.
[00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:32.009]  And a nice little letter to the editor that is in the Day newspaper.
[00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.411]  We're too fat and happy to appreciate freedom.
[00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:35.272]  It's short and sweet.
[00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:36.453]  I want to read that.
[00:02:36.853 --> 00:02:38.034]  And a little tidbit here.
[00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:43.799]  Radioactive produce on sale in Moscow 20 years after Chair Noble.
[00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.960]  So eat up.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.881]  It's good for you.
[00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:48.843]  And there have been the last few days, on average, about 20 people...
[00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:54.526]  Well, it's like 15 one day, 20 last night, 10 the day before that, 30 the day before that.
[00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:58.708]  It's 20 plus below zero Celsius.
[00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.331]  And it is just devastating over there right now.
[00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:05.872]  And of course, they have more natural gas.
[00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:22.002]  Then you can shake a stick at, I mean, it's just the country is sitting on top of some of the biggest deposits in the world, and they have plenty of it in the tanks, but because it's a corrupt country, they can't get it to the people, so they're turning their gas off in Moscow, and people are dying en masse.
[00:03:22.022 --> 00:03:24.723]  It's all part of the new freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:25.263 --> 00:03:28.984]  Don't worry, there's plenty of money to spy on you and shut down newspapers.
[00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:34.345]  And data mining for kids, children can't opt out of Pentagon recruitment databases.
[00:03:35.493 --> 00:03:36.895]  We will get into that.
[00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:44.242]  And Pentagon official is saying, Golan, Iraq is not democracy.
[00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:47.625]  And they're on the record saying it isn't democracy.
[00:03:47.686 --> 00:03:48.847]  It's never been democracy.
[00:03:49.207 --> 00:03:51.930]  And the Pentagon battle plans, the Israeli battle plans, state that.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.041]  Thank you.
[00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:10.497]  So we'll get into that as well.
[00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:14.839]  An Iraq Interior Minister okayed torture, ex-general is now saying.
[00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.261]  And you talk about brutality.
[00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:18.842]  Again, more of the balkanization.
[00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:22.724]  They engineer the collapse of society.
[00:04:23.604 --> 00:04:29.587]  And Torture Victory Song to be theme of Chinese government New Year shows in United States venues.
[00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:32.508]  We're going to have Chinese military marching in several major U.S.
[00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:32.768]  cities.
[00:04:32.788 --> 00:04:34.269]  It's all part of the love and the freedom.
[00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.391]  And they've got a torture song that they torture people to, and they admit they do this, at the re-education centers.
[00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:41.131]  This is out of U.S.
[00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.772]  Newswire.
[00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:45.753]  And their marching bands are going to be playing that.
[00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:50.715]  Folks, yes, this is a Twilight Zone episode, but it's real.
[00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:52.016]  It's not fiction.
[00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:55.045]  Folks, there's so much today.
[00:04:55.105 --> 00:04:56.008]  Two big guests.
[00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.719]  The father of weather weapons, and we'll talk about the new freedom initiative with Dr. Breeding.
[00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:02.657]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:05.920]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.964]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:14.228]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:18.352]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:20.334]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:23.818]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.858 --> 00:05:24.919]  The medical bills.
[00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.560]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.741]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:34.802]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.262 --> 00:05:41.384]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.704 --> 00:05:42.605]  Go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.213]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:06.314]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:10.735]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.155 --> 00:06:11.996]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:16.897]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.498]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:20.838]  Sheltering in place.
[00:06:21.283 --> 00:06:34.674]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.714 --> 00:06:41.840]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.303]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:48.246]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.512 --> 00:07:04.495]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[00:07:04.935 --> 00:07:08.397]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[00:07:08.857 --> 00:07:12.079]  Cardavite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.063]  Made from seven herbs, cardavite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:19.044]  Here's what one person has to say.
[00:07:19.364 --> 00:07:23.045]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[00:07:23.205 --> 00:07:27.046]  I don't have the tightness of my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:28.466]  I've tried all kinds of junk.
[00:07:28.646 --> 00:07:29.166]  It didn't do.
[00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:31.267]  The only thing that worked was your cardiovite.
[00:07:31.647 --> 00:07:33.987]  If you believe cardiovite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.
[00:07:34.027 --> 00:07:34.607]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:35.848]  Or visit our website at heartdrop.com.
[00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.735]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P dot com.
[00:07:52.135 --> 00:07:55.099]  Cardavite is an all-natural supplement, so call today.
[00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:55.779]  1-877-928-8822.
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:03.728]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:07.072]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.757 --> 00:08:21.647]  Coming up in the second hour, we're going to have Ben Livingston on with us for about 30 minutes or so.
[00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:25.634]  He is the father of weather warfare.
[00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:48.502]  And you see, I like to cover this subject because it's not speculation about HAARP and government weather control and advanced weather modification using antennas to ionize different layers of the atmosphere and manipulate the Gulf Stream and the Jet Stream, which certainly that has been declassified to a certain degree.
[00:08:48.962 --> 00:08:50.423]  Certainly they have studied it.
[00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.424]  They have tested it.
[00:08:51.884 --> 00:08:53.125]  Some of that is going on.
[00:08:54.446 --> 00:08:56.387]  But with Ben Livingston, he's the guy.
[00:08:57.493 --> 00:08:59.795]  Who flooded northern Vietnam.
[00:09:00.516 --> 00:09:04.300]  He's the guy when they have weather channel specials about weather warriors.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.662]  He's the guy who commanded it.
[00:09:06.722 --> 00:09:10.746]  He's the person who first did it with them shooting SAM missiles at him.
[00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:19.734]  And back in the late 60s, they had the Stanford Research Institute look at the findings that he'd shown over the last decade.
[00:09:20.939 --> 00:09:22.600]  But why is this interview so important?
[00:09:53.448 --> 00:10:07.916]  He couldn't talk until just a few years ago, five years ago, when part of the projects he was involved in and part of the projects that he commanded, I mean, in his career, he personally briefed President Johnson in his career.
[00:10:07.936 --> 00:10:18.321]  He commanded entire research bases, some of the largest in the country, like the Naval Research Laboratory.
[00:10:19.728 --> 00:10:20.808]  It just goes on and on.
[00:10:20.888 --> 00:10:25.569]  Why is this so important, what's coming up in the next hour with Ben Livingston?
[00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:45.872]  It's important because this naval officer developed and proved and tested cloud seeding that had been around since he was a young man, even before he got into the Navy, when he went to school to be a meteorologist and to be a cloud physicist.
[00:10:46.133 --> 00:10:48.833]  That's the more classical term for them.
[00:10:50.550 --> 00:11:16.406]  It is conclusive fact, certified, that they can take, and he said this privately off air to me, now he's gone more public, and I'm making a documentary that he's included in, you know, he'd say on air, well, we can knock a hurricane down by 30, 40 percent from 150 miles an hour in a Category 5, or Category 4, down to a Category 2, down to a Category 1 with 80 to 100 mile an hour winds.
[00:11:16.466 --> 00:11:16.626]  Well,
[00:11:17.573 --> 00:11:20.675]  Frankly, that's what they got certified back in the 60s.
[00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:30.841]  And clearly, they were able to kill hurricanes that were out threatening the east coast of the United States.
[00:11:31.541 --> 00:11:32.802]  But you know how science is.
[00:11:32.822 --> 00:11:40.587]  They like to go with the lowest provable standard and facts that they can show.
[00:11:41.187 --> 00:11:54.331]  But now, he said they can deliver hundreds of times per airplane the particulate matter, the nuclei, that is needed inside the storm energy centers that energize.
[00:11:54.351 --> 00:11:57.251]  There's normally about four to five of them in a large hurricane.
[00:11:57.531 --> 00:12:01.793]  They go in and attack those with just a few aircraft, and they can knock them dead.
[00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:04.453]  They can keep them from even coming in to shore.
[00:12:04.493 --> 00:12:10.115]  They can force them to dump their water and their energy out in the Gulf or out in the Atlantic or out in the Pacific.
[00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:17.041]  And they're not letting private companies, the Navy, they're not letting anybody do this.
[00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:23.627]  This is old, proven, old hat, just, it's like the steam engine.
[00:12:23.727 --> 00:12:30.693]  I mean, it's guaranteed, it's been proven, and it's been, quote, called obsolete and just ignored.
[00:12:32.094 --> 00:12:34.796]  And Ben will tell you why he thinks this is going on.
[00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:36.498]  He's talked to some people in government.
[00:12:37.797 --> 00:12:42.858]  Ben will tell you, he said on this show, and privately, I've talked to him and he's said a lot more.
[00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.479]  Now, he called me up a few weeks ago and he said, I want to come on and say even more.
[00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:49.259]  I'm getting really mad about this because you ought to hear him in private.
[00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.699]  Well, you're going to probably hear, I guess, some of that today.
[00:12:51.719 --> 00:13:02.541]  Because he loves America and he wants to be, I guess, somewhat dutiful towards the government and things he's sworn not to talk about, even though they're now, a lot of them declassified.
[00:13:03.342 --> 00:13:05.722]  Some of it still is classified, but he's angry.
[00:13:06.705 --> 00:13:09.935]  And he has said already on this broadcast that it's because...
[00:13:11.368 --> 00:13:13.190]  Washington wants a disaster.
[00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:23.598]  Really, they want to hand out $200 billion to their buddies like Halliburton that's already getting tens of billions just in the New Orleans area.
[00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:29.483]  And according to all the reports, is absolutely doing a horrible job and scamming everyone.
[00:13:29.923 --> 00:13:34.767]  Well, they've already been found guilty of that and had to pay a bunch of fines and fees, but it's always a slap on the wrist.
[00:13:34.968 --> 00:13:37.149]  Here's $10 billion, but oh, we caught you being bad.
[00:13:37.169 --> 00:13:38.590]  You've got to pay a $50 million, $60 million...
[00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:42.172]  Punishment fine.
[00:13:42.332 --> 00:13:44.393]  Oh, well, I'll be more than glad to.
[00:13:45.994 --> 00:13:57.658]  So, it'd be like if the cops caught you stealing money out of a cash register at a 7-Eleven, and a cop runs up behind you, puts a gun to your head, and says...
[00:13:58.627 --> 00:14:11.819]  Listen, hands up, get up against the wall, and then he grabs the bag of money away from you and takes $20 out of there when there's $1,000 in there, and goes, okay, now you're punished, and gives you the bag of money so you can run on down the street.
[00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:18.946]  One thing they really got right in the new movie, Syriana, that is admittedly based on a true story,
[00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:43.742]  Is that there's this federal investigator, and then he's working with the lawyer for the big oil company firm, and the lawyer for the oil company firm just says, look, we're not... He's sitting there talking to the government individual, and he says, look, I understand that the government's not looking for real crime fighting, a real end to corruption.
[00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:46.484]  You just want the illusion of it.
[00:14:46.544 --> 00:14:48.264]  You just want the...
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.021]  The view that that is happening.
[00:15:00.423 --> 00:15:01.443]  So that's what's happening.
[00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:07.765]  And so they just try to keep up appearances that the corruption is being fought and something's being done about it.
[00:15:08.045 --> 00:15:10.006]  I mean, the same thing goes for Iraq.
[00:15:10.966 --> 00:15:12.667]  Does the government make...
[00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:27.476]  Do the contractors that feed on the government and surround the government, do they make more money if we're in Iraq a year and fix the problems and let them have elections and pull out?
[00:15:27.956 --> 00:15:32.037]  Or do the globalists and their interests make more money and get more power?
[00:15:32.077 --> 00:15:39.559]  Does the government gain more power and gain a military beachhead right in the middle of the Middle East if we're there 20 years, 50 years, 100 years?
[00:15:42.288 --> 00:15:43.709]  And then you know the answer.
[00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.473]  All the rhetoric, all the propaganda means absolutely nothing.
[00:15:49.914 --> 00:16:03.846]  And the same thing goes for the technologies that are 100% proven to massively weaken hurricanes and massively reduce the amount of water that they dump on cities.
[00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:11.632]  And the evidence clearly shows you can flat out knock them out and just turn them into a tropical depression, again, at the bare minimum.
[00:16:13.002 --> 00:16:15.703]  Why then won't they allow this?
[00:16:15.823 --> 00:16:17.263]  Why then is nothing done?
[00:16:17.723 --> 00:16:20.984]  Because out of that disaster, FEMA gets larger.
[00:16:21.484 --> 00:16:23.924]  We get conditioned that the feds are there to save us.
[00:16:24.385 --> 00:16:30.866]  The politicians get to hand out hundreds of billions of dollars to their cronies and lackeys and buddies.
[00:16:31.826 --> 00:16:37.507]  And without ever even hearing my radio show, that's the exact same conclusion that Ben Livingston came to.
[00:16:38.488 --> 00:16:40.488]  And that's why he's gone public.
[00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.949]  And is now criticizing the government.
[00:16:43.349 --> 00:16:57.540]  And again, you ought to hear him in private, but I'll respect him and won't say some of the things that he's told me in private because I have met him in person and had a chance to video tape an interview with him and of course put it on prisonplanet.tv and air it here locally in Austin.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.243]  We also got him on Coast to Coast AM to talk about what's happening.
[00:17:01.903 --> 00:17:07.087]  But that's what we do on this broadcast is I tend to focus in on the issues that we can prove.
[00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:08.949]  And what we can prove...
[00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:16.257]  Is that the government knows that they can knock out these hurricanes, and they're not doing it.
[00:17:18.013 --> 00:17:21.754]  And CNN and ABC News and the rest of them aren't going to talk about it.
[00:17:21.794 --> 00:17:23.275]  I mean, that's pretty newsworthy.
[00:17:25.475 --> 00:17:34.158]  When a hurricane is slamming into Houston or slamming into New Orleans or slamming into Orlando or Miami or St.
[00:17:34.198 --> 00:17:40.340]  Petersburg, Florida, it is extremely newsworthy when it's going into Georgia or Alabama.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.161]  Or North or South Carolina or New York City for that matter.
[00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:52.604]  You would think it's newsworthy that since the 60s they know how to create storms out of nothing and they know how to knock out storms.
[00:17:53.224 --> 00:17:55.405]  As easy as kiss my hand, piece of cake.
[00:17:56.025 --> 00:17:57.206]  Why isn't it happening?
[00:17:57.486 --> 00:18:06.889]  So we'll spend about 30 minutes with our guest, the father of weather warfare, Ben Livingston, coming up in the next hour.
[00:18:06.929 --> 00:18:10.050]  Then we've got Dr. John Breeding joining us.
[00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:13.292]  And, of course, he's a psychologist.
[00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:14.052]  He's an author.
[00:18:14.692 --> 00:18:23.135]  He has exposed the Ritalin, the Prozac, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, what they're doing to our children, how they're increasing depression, increasing suicide.
[00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:36.280]  And, of course, he's gone from being a voice in the wilderness decades ago to now advisories, advisements being on the advisories that are in the serotonin, the well...
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.581]  Buterin-type manipulation drugs.
[00:18:40.221 --> 00:18:42.743]  Because they admit it massively increases suicide.
[00:18:42.763 --> 00:18:44.864]  It actually increases depression.
[00:18:45.204 --> 00:18:51.627]  What'll happen is you'll be happy, but then you'll have violent spikes down into very serious depression that are very, very dangerous.
[00:18:51.707 --> 00:18:57.409]  It actually causes a chemical imbalance, and these classes of drugs are very, very toxic and dangerous.
[00:18:57.889 --> 00:19:03.912]  And New Freedom got passed last year at the federal level for forced psychological testing and then drugging of the American people.
[00:19:04.412 --> 00:19:05.113]  We're good to go.
[00:19:27.578 --> 00:19:33.781]  It's being shot down in many states, but still it's being implemented, even though there's not a local law to couple with it.
[00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:38.464]  So that's coming up in the third hour, and we'll have reading for the entire hour.
[00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:46.448]  Tomorrow we've got Dylan Avery, the director of the great 9-11 documentary, Loose Change 2, that we carry at Infowars.com.
[00:19:46.928 --> 00:19:48.969]  We've got him coming on tomorrow.
[00:19:50.743 --> 00:19:56.612]  When we get back, I am not going to talk about any weather warfare or forced drugging of the children.
[00:19:56.632 --> 00:19:57.854]  I'm going to talk about Iran.
[00:19:58.054 --> 00:19:59.737]  Very important, so get ready.
[00:20:01.044 --> 00:20:02.625]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.005 --> 00:20:08.749]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:20:09.009 --> 00:20:14.153]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:20:14.493 --> 00:20:23.759]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[00:20:29.381 --> 00:20:33.403]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:20:33.603 --> 00:20:38.365]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:20:38.745 --> 00:20:44.607]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.371]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:14.294]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C.
[00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:17.175]  and therefore bypass the state governments?
[00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:21.197]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[00:21:22.523 --> 00:21:22.943]  We're good to go.
[00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:39.292]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.

[00:24:16.989 --> 00:24:22.352]  Alright, let's get into the Iran situation.
[00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:28.795]  I mean, you watch the news, and it's as if it's the end of the world.
[00:24:29.415 --> 00:24:33.517]  Iran is vicious, they're going to nuke us, they're going to murder us.
[00:24:34.654 --> 00:24:37.815]  They use little word tricks like, they're going nuclear.
[00:24:38.355 --> 00:24:43.696]  They've taken off the shields from the nuke.
[00:24:44.177 --> 00:24:46.957]  Can you imagine someone activating a warhead?
[00:24:47.337 --> 00:24:49.158]  They've got long-range missiles.
[00:24:49.198 --> 00:24:51.098]  They're going to destroy America.
[00:24:51.459 --> 00:24:52.559]  They're going to destroy Israel.
[00:24:54.076 --> 00:25:05.884]  And then every week or two, I see fake reports where different neocon publications will say, Iran has threatened to attack Israel and nuke them.
[00:25:06.665 --> 00:25:09.967]  And then there'll be a retraction a day later in the back of the newspaper.
[00:25:10.347 --> 00:25:14.250]  Iran's very upset and clearly the translation has been redone.
[00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.470]  They didn't say that.
[00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:20.514]  The actual translation was, we are peaceful and only want this for nuclear power.
[00:25:22.143 --> 00:25:23.584]  I mean, I see that all the time.
[00:25:23.844 --> 00:25:26.005]  And then Christina Amanpour.
[00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.746]  Total government shill.
[00:25:28.246 --> 00:25:29.947]  Always shilling, always lying.
[00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:31.628]  And again, folks, I'm not a Serb.
[00:25:31.648 --> 00:25:34.389]  I just know the history over there.
[00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:35.950]  I'm just stating the facts.
[00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.771]  So, Croats, please don't send me a bunch of emails.
[00:25:39.251 --> 00:25:42.693]  The facts are, Christina Amanpour did lie about mass graves.
[00:25:43.073 --> 00:25:46.315]  Christina Amanpour did propagandize.
[00:25:47.115 --> 00:25:48.536]  Christina Amanpour...
[00:25:49.582 --> 00:25:50.762]  Remember ITN?
[00:25:52.143 --> 00:25:53.604]  Back when Clinton attacked the Balkans?
[00:25:53.684 --> 00:25:58.765]  It's admitted that ITN showed fake pictures of, quote, concentration camp victims.
[00:25:58.805 --> 00:26:07.709]  They showed one guy who had a disease, who was homeless, at the fence trying to get into the AIDS center, begging for food.
[00:26:09.378 --> 00:26:11.681]  But no, look, it was the cover of Time and Newsweek.
[00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:13.723]  Concentration camps.
[00:26:14.184 --> 00:26:16.506]  And that's admitted that ITN did that in Britain.
[00:26:16.787 --> 00:26:18.749]  Christina Amanpour did similar stuff.
[00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:21.993]  Well, what does Christina Amanpour do this time?
[00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:41.400]  Christina Amanpour, of course married to one of Bill Clinton's national security advisors, just another horrible creature, total insiders, total agents, she comes out and says the president said in a speech that he's going to nuke Israel and he's building nukes.
[00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:45.202]  I mean, on its face they knew that wasn't true.
[00:26:45.242 --> 00:26:47.864]  The translation wasn't anywhere near that.
[00:26:47.924 --> 00:26:49.905]  The woman speaks Arabic as well.
[00:26:50.165 --> 00:26:51.646]  She didn't even need a translator.
[00:26:53.047 --> 00:26:54.028]  And so what happened?
[00:26:54.688 --> 00:26:55.449]  I know it's Persian.
[00:26:55.529 --> 00:26:56.069]  It's similar.
[00:26:56.089 --> 00:26:56.709]  She speaks that.
[00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.631]  That's on record.
[00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:03.854]  She didn't even need the person that was there doing the translation.
[00:27:05.095 --> 00:27:09.557]  CNN runs with it, and everybody, see, it's true!
[00:27:09.818 --> 00:27:11.258]  They're going to nuke them!
[00:27:11.459 --> 00:27:12.199]  He said it!
[00:27:12.399 --> 00:27:13.420]  We've got to invade!
[00:27:16.428 --> 00:27:17.708]  And it's the same thing.
[00:27:17.728 --> 00:27:21.609]  We're being lied to by the very same crew that's lied to us all along.
[00:27:22.129 --> 00:27:27.991]  Now, the CIA's own intelligence reports from multiple offices, different analysts.
[00:27:28.011 --> 00:27:29.931]  We've interviewed Ray McGovern on this as well.
[00:27:31.132 --> 00:27:33.372]  He's talked to the analysts inside the CIA.
[00:27:34.272 --> 00:27:44.615]  If Iran was given everything it needed, everything it needs to build an A-bomb, the most primitive type, one decade...
[00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.211]  One decade.
[00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:50.592]  That is ten standard years.
[00:27:50.833 --> 00:27:53.434]  Ten times 365 days.
[00:27:53.854 --> 00:27:54.914]  How many times is that?
[00:27:54.974 --> 00:27:55.455]  Ten times 365.
[00:27:55.495 --> 00:27:58.156]  That's how long.
[00:27:58.276 --> 00:28:00.317]  And then, South Africa's got nukes.
[00:28:00.357 --> 00:28:01.517]  Their little communist government.
[00:28:01.697 --> 00:28:03.138]  That's what it is down in South Africa, by the way.
[00:28:03.158 --> 00:28:03.718]  You didn't know that?
[00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:09.581]  They've got, what, at least 30 with missiles and ships and cruise missiles.
[00:28:11.076 --> 00:28:12.957]  What about Israel with 400?
[00:28:13.637 --> 00:28:17.960]  And they're now getting nuclear subs, not just German diesel dolphin subs.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.661]  They've got top-of-the-line cruise missiles.
[00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:28.765]  China's got thousands of warheads and dozens and dozens of Long March rockets with 12 warheads conservatively.
[00:28:29.145 --> 00:28:31.387]  Could have as many as 24, though that's classified.
[00:28:31.427 --> 00:28:39.811]  We know they've got MIRV re-entry vehicles in there, that is multiple cases that pop up and shoot out different mini-missiles at different targets.
[00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:41.333]  That's a whole other subject.
[00:28:41.793 --> 00:28:42.654]  And then what?
[00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:48.802]  Four months ago the top Chinese general, the head of war planning, number three in their government.
[00:28:50.063 --> 00:28:57.427]  Number three in the government held a press conference with over a hundred top reporters.
[00:28:57.507 --> 00:28:59.207]  Wall Street Journal, Time, Newsweek.
[00:28:59.488 --> 00:29:03.810]  And he said, we are prepared to launch an attack and destroy 200 U.S.
[00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:04.270]  cities.
[00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:19.017]  If you get involved in any Chinese protectorates or possessions or in any of our national security or national interest projects, we will launch a preemptive strike and destroy...
[00:29:19.989 --> 00:29:22.921]  200 of your largest cities.
[00:29:26.883 --> 00:29:29.005]  By the way, Austin is the 39th largest city.
[00:29:29.045 --> 00:29:31.907]  Even little towns like mine are high on the hit list.
[00:29:32.547 --> 00:29:37.491]  Multiple missiles are targeted on my family right now.
[00:29:37.991 --> 00:29:50.861]  But that's not a problem with their top general, number three in the Chinese government, saying he will kill me and my family and your family, and our government just loves him.
[00:29:51.502 --> 00:29:52.422]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.903 --> 00:29:54.404]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.496 --> 00:30:07.938]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:30:08.218 --> 00:30:11.819]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:30:11.959 --> 00:30:20.062]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:30:20.322 --> 00:30:25.965]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:30:26.265 --> 00:30:31.508]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:30:31.768 --> 00:30:33.869]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[00:30:34.109 --> 00:30:46.276]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:30:46.496 --> 00:30:50.920]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:52.081]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:52.282 --> 00:30:53.903]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:30:54.023 --> 00:30:55.825]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:30:56.085 --> 00:30:56.546]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:30:56.566 --> 00:30:56.766]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:31:03.783 --> 00:31:04.424]  We're good to go.
[00:31:27.542 --> 00:31:37.263]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:37.383 --> 00:31:46.265]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:46.525 --> 00:31:49.826]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:31:52.086 --> 00:31:53.829]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:31:53.949 --> 00:31:54.189]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:32:04.329 --> 00:32:07.630]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:13.251]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:15.391]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.
[00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:20.232]  Vitamir has created unique and natural patented formulas that set them apart from any other oral hygiene products.
[00:32:20.452 --> 00:32:26.854]  The folks at Vitamir have blended zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and fulv oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath and fight gum disease.
[00:32:27.054 --> 00:32:32.995]  Good health starts in your mouth, and regular use of Vitamir Toothpaste and Mouthwash is a powerful frontline defense against gingivitis, bleeding gum,
[00:32:33.075 --> 00:32:33.775]  We're good to go.
[00:32:33.795 --> 00:32:34.335]  We're good to go.
[00:33:12.687 --> 00:33:20.220]  All right, let me hurry through the Iran situation, then we'll go to John, Randy Gill, Jason, Jeff, and many others.
[00:33:21.522 --> 00:33:24.908]  We do have two great guests coming up today to talk about forced drugging of our children.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:32.384]  With the guidelines to do it, actually written up by the drug companies, they write the laws, and then the Congress passes them, Bush signs them.
[00:33:32.925 --> 00:33:36.267]  Now they're implementing at the state level, but there is resistance, thank God.
[00:33:36.307 --> 00:33:37.888]  Thank all of you out there that are fighting it.
[00:33:38.228 --> 00:33:46.294]  That's in the third hour, the father of weather weapons, who use them, who deploy them himself, with SAM missiles flying all around him, blowing up aircraft around him.
[00:33:46.755 --> 00:33:51.438]  He's coming on with us in the next hour, because the government knows how to stop hurricanes, but isn't doing it.
[00:33:53.132 --> 00:34:00.577]  And there are tropical storms now in the Atlantic and just a few weeks ago in the Caribbean when there's not even supposed to be there in this time of year.
[00:34:01.017 --> 00:34:05.641]  It's 20-something below zero Celsius in Moscow.
[00:34:05.681 --> 00:34:07.262]  People are dying, 20-something.
[00:34:07.282 --> 00:34:08.563]  I think they said 20.
[00:34:09.003 --> 00:34:10.464]  One report said 25.
[00:34:10.564 --> 00:34:10.904]  I don't know.
[00:34:10.944 --> 00:34:12.465]  It's 20-something last night died.
[00:34:13.066 --> 00:34:16.168]  It is really scary, but again, we'll get into that later.
[00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:24.989]  Understand, folks, Kim Jong-il admittedly has a seven-story pleasure palace.
[00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.156]  He is a psychopathic little demon dwarf.
[00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:32.100]  Who just last year to Newsweek Magazine apologized.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.100]  Well, they carried it.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.442]  How he kidnapped a bunch of South Korean starlets and raped and killed them.
[00:34:38.522 --> 00:34:48.905]  I mean, he literally is like in a bad movie where, you know, in the future, there's like an evil planet with this evil little leader who kidnaps women and rapes and kills them.
[00:34:48.965 --> 00:34:52.946]  I mean, it's like something out of a horror movie or science fiction.
[00:34:53.106 --> 00:34:53.986]  So much of this is.
[00:34:54.367 --> 00:34:55.727]  He is a horrible creature.
[00:34:56.653 --> 00:35:05.320]  They sell human body parts openly in bazaars on the streets of their capital city in North Korea.
[00:35:06.561 --> 00:35:11.105]  He is a hereditary dictator, just like Bush is trying to become one.
[00:35:11.145 --> 00:35:12.366]  His daddy was the leader.
[00:35:12.426 --> 00:35:14.347]  Now Kim Jong-il is the leader.
[00:35:14.367 --> 00:35:17.690]  It's just unspeakable.
[00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.392]  And he's got at least
[00:35:21.138 --> 00:35:22.459]  And this was out years ago.
[00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:25.341]  The mainstream media is always going, he may have one or five weapons.
[00:35:25.981 --> 00:35:30.584]  It was declassified many years ago that he had upwards of ten.
[00:35:31.164 --> 00:35:34.266]  And now in the last few years, he's tested the Taipan Dong-2.
[00:35:35.267 --> 00:35:46.094]  South Korean parliament freaked out four years ago, and it was all over their news, never on our news, that North Korea admittedly fired a dummy intercontinental ballistic missile
[00:35:47.373 --> 00:35:51.015]  That hit Alaska, parts of it were picked up, and that was kept quiet.
[00:35:51.475 --> 00:36:05.601]  Because when they're beating the war drums, getting ready back in 2001, 2002 to go into Iraq, you can't go, well, we're going to invade them, but this country that shot a missile at us, a dummy missile, everything's fine.
[00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:16.025]  What was that movie with Harrison Ford, You Something, The Widowmaker, based on a true story where the Russians go and they break up through the ice and they fire a test missile?
[00:36:16.948 --> 00:36:22.162]  At the North Pole, just to test and see if they can hit the U.S., and it's based on a true story.
[00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:28.970]  Well, that's what the North Koreans did, but they actually hit Alaska.
[00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:45.677]  Again, we have people firing missiles at us, but it's just like the Mexican border with hundreds of incursions and 15 dead cops in Texas this year and 800-plus dead and 54 captured and American citizens kidnapped in one swath and taken for ransom and U.S.
[00:36:46.017 --> 00:36:50.139]  mission from the embassy shutting down with rocket-propelled grenades blowing up.
[00:36:51.153 --> 00:36:52.053]  Nothing on the news.
[00:36:52.414 --> 00:36:55.335]  We've been screaming about it for a while, so now it's being discussed a little bit.
[00:36:55.595 --> 00:36:58.836]  But the point is, is that they tell you what to be upset about.
[00:36:59.236 --> 00:37:04.618]  They tell you, the social engineers, the architects, what to be worried about, and I, frankly, am sick of it.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.781]  And they keep just saying, nuclear, nuclear, they're going nuclear, we can't let them go nuclear.
[00:37:11.801 --> 00:37:16.063]  And then you read deeply into the articles, it says, we can't let them have these reactors.
[00:37:16.123 --> 00:37:18.964]  And then all the top physicists, all the top scientists...
[00:37:19.551 --> 00:37:21.753]  The scientists who've been allowed, they've let thousands in.
[00:37:21.793 --> 00:37:23.174]  Anybody who wants to come and look can look.
[00:37:23.814 --> 00:37:29.719]  It is classical peaceful reactors like a university would have or like a town would have.
[00:37:29.999 --> 00:37:36.283]  I mean, it cannot be used to make nuclear weapons or atomic weapons.
[00:37:36.604 --> 00:37:44.950]  Now, that doesn't mean that the globalists or some other group they hire isn't going to carry out a suitcase nuke or a small device of some type, a frog,
[00:37:46.428 --> 00:37:47.008]  We're good to go.
[00:38:15.146 --> 00:38:18.287]  That's why they'll steal trillions from the Pentagon, openly, no one gets in trouble.
[00:38:18.528 --> 00:38:20.929]  Hundreds of millions, you know, Congressmen personally stealing it.
[00:38:21.249 --> 00:38:22.029]  Nothing's happening.
[00:38:22.329 --> 00:38:25.050]  That's why, because they got a big finale.
[00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.852]  They got an ace in the hole, a little secret that nobody knows.
[00:38:29.452 --> 00:38:30.653]  You know, life is a gamble.
[00:38:31.473 --> 00:38:35.855]  A game we all play, so George Strait says, and the globalists know that.
[00:38:37.074 --> 00:38:40.555]  And so now the EU, yes, we might have to attack you.
[00:38:41.115 --> 00:38:46.556]  Yes, the Russians, well, we're going to pull our people out and evacuate, and we're not going to help you.
[00:38:48.937 --> 00:38:51.598]  Showing how staged all of this is.
[00:38:51.658 --> 00:39:01.940]  So let me just, because I want to get to your calls, let me just read this article that is just excellent by Mike Whitney that spells it out.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.001]  Everything he says here, I verified up one side and down the other.
[00:39:05.041 --> 00:39:05.981]  This is all documented.
[00:39:07.325 --> 00:39:09.067]  More lies about Iran.
[00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:15.932]  There's been a lot of rubbish written about Iran's removing the seals from its uranium enrichment equipment.
[00:39:16.113 --> 00:39:24.319]  The fear-mongering Western media, which is owned by the military-industrial complex, I should add, have exploited the expression for all it's worth.
[00:39:24.339 --> 00:39:27.402]  Again, the defense contractors control all three of the big networks.
[00:39:28.042 --> 00:39:35.729]  Even those who are normally skeptical of the Bush administration propaganda machine are taken aback by this ominous-sounding phrase.
[00:39:37.378 --> 00:39:44.565]  Well, the media has to act like we're in time for another war, like they're kind of against Bush, to make it look like there's really a debate going on.
[00:39:44.585 --> 00:39:51.251]  But then when it's time to go in, suddenly every Democrat, every Republican, unless it's Ron Paul, goes, Absolutely, let's do it!
[00:39:52.793 --> 00:40:00.280]  How else does one make nuclear fuel for electric power plants if the fuel-producing mechanism is under lock and key?
[00:40:01.528 --> 00:40:15.661]  The fear engineering description provided in the news would have the reader believe that diabolical Iranians are ripping off the shields with crowbars so they can quickly assemble their secret nuclear stockpile to bomb Tel Aviv.
[00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:22.047]  By the way, Japan has already developed hundreds of nuclear weapons and missiles.
[00:40:22.087 --> 00:40:25.730]  That's now been admitted quietly, but it's been in a few papers if you look.
[00:40:27.254 --> 00:40:28.275]  Nobody's worried about that, though.
[00:40:28.715 --> 00:40:31.197]  This is the worst type of demagoguery, he says.
[00:40:31.217 --> 00:40:32.037]  This is the worst type.
[00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:38.841]  The fuel that is produced from these uranium enrichment reactors does not produce weapons-grade material.
[00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:44.524]  That requires thousands of centrifuges, which, remember, they lied about with aluminum tubes.
[00:40:44.564 --> 00:40:47.046]  Turned out the New York Times writer was a CIA minion.
[00:40:47.066 --> 00:40:50.468]  Oh, get a little liberal paper backing it up.
[00:40:50.488 --> 00:40:51.048]  See how they do it?
[00:40:51.548 --> 00:40:55.330]  That requires thousands of centrifuges, which Iran does not have.
[00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.051]  Ahem.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:05.108]  At the same time, the Nuclear Watchdog Agency, the IAEA, has on-site inspectors and cameras monitoring the entire process.
[00:41:05.649 --> 00:41:07.951]  Everything is under constant observation.
[00:41:07.971 --> 00:41:12.676]  This isn't like sneaking in the dark and making a ham sandwich, folks.
[00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.940]  This takes a huge output of energy.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.141]  It's public.
[00:41:17.797 --> 00:41:30.702]  Additionally, as nuclear weapons physicist Gordon Prather states, after almost three years of go-anywhere, see-anything, interview-anyone inspections... In fact, the IAEA admitted no one has ever given this much access.
[00:41:32.803 --> 00:41:45.588]  Again, additionally, as nuclear weapons physicist Gordon Prather says, states, after almost three years of go-anywhere, see-anything, interview-anybody inspections, the IAEA...
[00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:48.160]  We're good to go.
[00:42:02.335 --> 00:42:09.440]  Spewing out of MSM and the Bush administration to build the case for the war with Iran.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.981]  What could be more clear?
[00:42:11.041 --> 00:42:12.722]  The public does not have a choice, however.
[00:42:13.102 --> 00:42:24.630]  Either they can accept the credible statements from the Nobel Prize winning Mohammed El Barabi, chief of the IAEA, or the spurious allegations of the liar-in-chief.
[00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.111]  Which will it be?
[00:42:26.551 --> 00:42:27.912]  Removing the seals.
[00:42:28.272 --> 00:42:32.155]  So why are the seals put on the Iranian conversion equipment?
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.401]  Why were they put there?
[00:42:37.142 --> 00:42:44.087]  Was Iran being punished for violations of the NPT, Non-Proliferation Treaty, for secretly developing nuclear weapons?
[00:42:44.267 --> 00:42:44.567]  No!
[00:42:45.047 --> 00:42:49.851]  But this seems to be the conclusion of most people who haven't followed the issue closely.
[00:42:50.371 --> 00:42:58.878]  The seals were put in place because the Iranian negotiators foolishly fell into a trap that was set by the EU-free England, France, and Germany.
[00:42:58.898 --> 00:43:03.281]  Yeah, they said, just put seals on it while we debate this, and then you can take them right off.
[00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:04.802]  And they said, okay.
[00:43:04.822 --> 00:43:06.402]  And that's why Iran gets madder and madder.
[00:43:06.922 --> 00:43:08.143]  They go, we've let you look at everything.
[00:43:08.163 --> 00:43:09.023]  We've done what you said.
[00:43:09.063 --> 00:43:11.924]  And now you're saying that you never agreed to let us take them off.
[00:43:12.845 --> 00:43:13.885]  Let me just stop right here.
[00:43:13.945 --> 00:43:14.746]  What's happened here?
[00:43:15.286 --> 00:43:16.466]  This is good cop, bad cop.
[00:43:17.487 --> 00:43:24.970]  Either you accept the UN totally running your country and totally controlling the technology you can develop when it's publicly for peaceful use.
[00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:32.840]  Or the bad cop comes and bombs living daylights out of you and invades you and salts your entire country with depleted uranium.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.321]  And the country's attacking you.
[00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:35.721]  We're so dumbed down and evil.
[00:43:36.462 --> 00:43:37.362]  The governments are evil.
[00:43:37.382 --> 00:43:43.225]  Their minions are so dumbed down that their own troops breathe the deadly poison and love it and thump their chest with glee.
[00:43:43.265 --> 00:43:45.386]  I mean, that's how crazy we are, folks.
[00:43:45.427 --> 00:43:47.087]  We are like kamikazes.
[00:43:47.748 --> 00:43:49.609]  It's just, we say it ain't bad.
[00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:52.890]  I mean, people are like, no, please don't use it on us.
[00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:53.831]  No, don't destroy.
[00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:56.273]  Well, our entire future, we is going to do it.
[00:43:56.313 --> 00:43:57.473]  We is going to do it.
[00:43:57.494 --> 00:43:58.274]  We is going to do it.
[00:43:58.294 --> 00:43:59.835]  I mean, that's what it is.
[00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:04.238]  We're going to use thousands of tons on all your major cities.
[00:44:04.698 --> 00:44:07.200]  And now Rumsfeld says they'll use tactical nukes on them.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:14.625]  And all these weirdos, the turn it into a glass parking lot crowd, just somehow gets on a power trip when they talk about nuking people.
[00:44:15.025 --> 00:44:16.046]  I just won't nuke them.
[00:44:16.406 --> 00:44:19.048]  I just won't kill them.
[00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:20.549]  And we've all heard them.
[00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:21.490]  You know who I'm talking about.
[00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:27.854]  They think it's manly to sit in their easy chair with giant pot bellies and talk about murdering people.
[00:44:28.816 --> 00:44:30.458]  The public does not have a choice, however.
[00:44:30.779 --> 00:44:36.928]  Either they can accept the credible statements from the Nobel Prize winning head of the IEA, or the spurious allegations of the liar-in-chief.
[00:44:38.317 --> 00:44:44.698]  The seals were put in place because the Iranian negotiators foolishly fell into the trap that was set by the EU3.
[00:44:44.958 --> 00:44:49.499]  And remember, Saddam didn't kick the inspectors out when Clinton had them in there.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.620]  He took them out and the news said Saddam kicked them out.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.921]  It didn't matter if it was a total lie.
[00:44:56.521 --> 00:44:57.401]  See, that's the thing.
[00:44:57.441 --> 00:45:07.083]  When you have a population who doesn't know anything about the world, anything about legislation, anything about branches of government, they just know they're bad and I heard it on the news.
[00:45:09.711 --> 00:45:20.858]  Iran agreed to confidence building, that's a quote, measures that would placate the United States, which included additional protocols that were not demanded under the terms of the treaty or required by the IEA.
[00:45:21.238 --> 00:45:28.703]  As it turns out, the EU used the extra concessions to make it look like Iran was violating the NPT after negotiations had ended.
[00:45:28.983 --> 00:45:34.447]  The EU strategy was a clever ploy that worked like a charm, but that doesn't change the facts.
[00:45:35.625 --> 00:45:37.185]  A clever ploy?
[00:45:37.205 --> 00:45:40.686]  I mean, I guess you're clever if you can fool a four-year-old.
[00:45:42.127 --> 00:45:44.307]  I mean, actually, four-year-olds are hard to fool.
[00:45:44.847 --> 00:45:48.148]  I guess you're clever if you can fool an 18-month-old.
[00:45:48.168 --> 00:45:48.608]  I don't know.
[00:45:48.628 --> 00:45:50.428]  I've got an 18-month-old.
[00:45:50.609 --> 00:45:51.449]  She's hard to fool.
[00:45:51.929 --> 00:45:55.490]  Okay, I guess you're clever if you can fool a one-day-old baby.
[00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:59.611]  I mean, that's the measure of fooling here.
[00:45:59.651 --> 00:46:00.671]  I mean, the same thing with Clinton.
[00:46:00.831 --> 00:46:01.031]  Again.
[00:46:02.317 --> 00:46:04.078]  They kicked out the inspectors.
[00:46:04.098 --> 00:46:05.218]  No, they didn't.
[00:46:05.338 --> 00:46:08.439]  I mean, it's just, do you like being lied to like this?
[00:46:09.379 --> 00:46:11.599]  Well, I'm against the liberals who were against the war.
[00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:14.380]  The biggest drumbeaters are a bunch of gun-grabbing liberals.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:15.821]  I'm sorry.
[00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:25.363]  Iran has not violated its treaty obligations, and the agreement with the EU3 was neither binding nor designed to be permanent.
[00:46:26.526 --> 00:46:32.312]  Iran has never given up its inalienable right, language of the NPT, to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
[00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:38.558]  Was Iran foolish to trust the EU3, not suspecting that Washington was orchestrating a media coup behind the scenes?
[00:46:38.638 --> 00:46:39.419]  Yes, they were.
[00:46:39.439 --> 00:46:42.482]  But I know, these governments are just gullible.
[00:46:43.095 --> 00:46:43.976]  Yes, they were.
[00:46:44.456 --> 00:46:46.458]  But that is not a violation of the treaty.
[00:46:46.758 --> 00:46:50.321]  That's simply being deceived by some very brainy neocons.
[00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:57.746]  You know, I don't want to toot our own horn, but after the London bombings, we wrote an article warning Iran to go public that the West is carrying out terror attacks.
[00:46:57.766 --> 00:47:02.049]  Oh, I just learned a big UT professor is now coming out and saying that.
[00:47:02.149 --> 00:47:03.691]  And we actually sent it out.
[00:47:03.731 --> 00:47:06.313]  It got posted on a bunch of big Iranian news websites.
[00:47:06.933 --> 00:47:10.716]  And two days later, the Iranian government came out and echoed exactly what we've said.
[00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.431]  What do you say to that, folks?
[00:47:16.451 --> 00:47:17.652]  I'm not trying to brag.
[00:47:17.672 --> 00:47:19.413]  We're not even that smart.
[00:47:19.493 --> 00:47:24.055]  I guess I'm kind of a good old boy from Texas, a little bit streetwise.
[00:47:24.095 --> 00:47:26.036]  You're not going to con me.
[00:47:26.096 --> 00:47:27.456]  At least you're not going to con me for long.
[00:47:27.516 --> 00:47:30.838]  After I've been conned a few times, I'm going to wake up.
[00:47:31.278 --> 00:47:33.219]  Fool me once, shame on you.
[00:47:33.459 --> 00:47:34.800]  Fool me twice, shame on me.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.460]  Shame on us, folks.
[00:47:36.861 --> 00:47:37.601]  Shame on us.
[00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:41.946]  And it goes on...
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:12.893]  Of Iran because it believes that all law flows from Washington, not just from Washington, from Bush's bosses, and the fact that it is tragically evident in the torturing of prisoners, spying on American citizens, and its vast destruction of Iraq.
[00:48:12.913 --> 00:48:24.624]  As long as the Bush media, which serves as an annex to the political establishment, can continue to hoodwink the American people and its alarmist misinformation, there's little chance that a war with Iran will be avoided.
[00:48:27.299 --> 00:48:40.405]  And for those that really want to know the truth, understand the truth about Iran's nuclear program and the many fictions traded in the press, there's no better place to start than the articles of nuclear physicist Dr. Gordon Prather.
[00:48:41.405 --> 00:48:42.346]  And that's at antiwar.com.
[00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:44.026]  And we're going to get him on.
[00:48:44.566 --> 00:48:52.750]  But they admittedly lied to us the entire time about Iraq.
[00:48:53.527 --> 00:49:11.842]  And now, exactly what we told you one year before the invasion, not because we have crystal balls, not because we're psychic, the Israeli documents, the PNAC documents, the Pentagon documents, Dick Cheney's own writing said, we're going to break the country up, we're going to screw it up, we're going to cause civil war.
[00:49:12.422 --> 00:49:21.950]  Brzezinski, trilateral commission head, wrote in 97, we're going to invade Afghanistan, we're going to invade Iraq, we're going to balkanize the whole place, we're going to break it up in three parts.
[00:49:23.328 --> 00:49:27.392]  What we want as an empire is to control our slaves at home.
[00:49:27.693 --> 00:49:29.174]  He calls us slaves, folks.
[00:49:29.655 --> 00:49:32.678]  They write books calling us slaves because they know we don't read what they write about us.
[00:49:32.998 --> 00:49:35.681]  They write it for their buddies to read as a playbook.
[00:49:36.322 --> 00:49:37.523]  This is why I'm angry, folks.
[00:49:37.883 --> 00:49:41.187]  They call us slaves and say we must unify our slaves
[00:49:41.807 --> 00:49:50.056]  To fight the barbarians, just as Caesar did, and to unify them, we need terror attacks in America on the order of Pearl Harbor or greater.
[00:49:50.377 --> 00:50:02.690]  Helpful Pearl Harbor events is the exact quote, and you find those same quotes, I mean, down to the word in the 2000 PNAC, Rebuilding America's Defenses, of a helpful catalyst event like a Pearl Harbor attack or greater.
[00:50:03.576 --> 00:50:11.720]  And then magically it happens, and magically, whereas all the evidence point to who did it, who has the motive, and then you look at all the evidence, voila, who has the motive did it.
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.040]  The Arabs don't have the motive.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.501]  The Persians don't have the motive.
[00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:17.842]  They are freaked out, totally scared to death.
[00:50:18.322 --> 00:50:20.683]  These attacks only radicalize their nations.
[00:50:21.584 --> 00:50:28.286]  Iran was a pro-Western place of freedom until our government carried out terror attacks there in 1953 to overthrow their government.
[00:50:30.262 --> 00:50:31.162]  Now, that's public.
[00:50:31.302 --> 00:50:36.143]  I had, again, two CIA chiefs, high-level minions, on two weeks ago.
[00:50:37.683 --> 00:50:40.644]  And I brought that up to them, and they go, yeah, it's true, we carried out terror attacks.
[00:50:40.924 --> 00:50:42.384]  And they do it all the time.
[00:50:42.844 --> 00:50:49.046]  And you want to send your kids off to breathe D.U., get their arms and legs blown off, and come back shattered like shattered pumpkins?
[00:50:49.986 --> 00:50:51.266]  I mean, we've got to fight this.
[00:50:51.846 --> 00:50:53.146]  We've got to expose this.
[00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:55.827]  Bunch of stinking government trash.
[00:51:02.223 --> 00:51:05.065]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.325 --> 00:51:06.026]  Hello, my friends.

[00:51:19.335 --> 00:51:21.316]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.516 --> 00:51:24.356]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.436 --> 00:51:29.098]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.318 --> 00:51:33.719]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:33.959 --> 00:51:41.181]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.421 --> 00:51:43.841]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:54:09.705 --> 00:54:28.420]  What lesson does it teach the Iranians that if you're a scumbag bucket of pus, I mean literally bucket of maggots is too nice to say, Kim Jong-il threatening to nuke us and firing missiles, test missiles that hit our country, and nothing's done, but then you don't have nukes, and you're being intimidated and bullied.
[00:54:29.661 --> 00:54:32.604]  And I have no doubt they're tinker-toying around trying to get a bomb.
[00:54:32.664 --> 00:54:35.366]  I mean, let's be honest, but they're not going to do it with this system they've got.
[00:54:37.168 --> 00:54:42.971]  It's just, you know, they're being told they can't, so they just want the bare minimum to be able to have their own power system.
[00:54:43.071 --> 00:54:44.692]  And then people go, well, you've got plenty of oil.
[00:54:44.712 --> 00:54:46.273]  Well, aren't they a sovereign country?
[00:54:46.633 --> 00:54:52.356]  The point is, is they're a decade away from this, and the government's acting like we've got to go invade them right now or they're going to get us.
[00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:56.058]  Meanwhile, if you're Israel, you can threaten to nuke Europe.
[00:54:56.538 --> 00:54:59.520]  Did you know one of the Knesset members did that?
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.241]  400 conservative weapons.
[00:55:02.086 --> 00:55:03.308]  High-tech weapons.
[00:55:03.488 --> 00:55:05.470]  Oh, and they're always busy selling everything to China.
[00:55:05.711 --> 00:55:08.554]  And I'm not even bashing Israel here, but just come on.
[00:55:08.914 --> 00:55:11.758]  Our own government's selling us out to China, our jobs, our weapons.
[00:55:13.119 --> 00:55:14.501]  Iran is not the threat.
[00:55:14.581 --> 00:55:15.863]  Saddam was not the threat.
[00:55:16.163 --> 00:55:17.725]  Our government set Saddam up.
[00:55:17.825 --> 00:55:19.107]  He worked for them.
[00:55:19.367 --> 00:55:20.849]  That's what's so sick about this.
[00:55:22.723 --> 00:55:24.544]  I'm no fan of any of those countries, folks.
[00:55:24.584 --> 00:55:25.404]  I'm an American.
[00:55:25.584 --> 00:55:28.226]  I just can't believe that scum runs our country.
[00:55:28.506 --> 00:55:32.187]  All right, John in Texas, then Randy, Gil, Jason, others.
[00:55:32.387 --> 00:55:32.647]  Go ahead.
[00:55:32.667 --> 00:55:33.328]  You're on the air, John.
[00:55:34.128 --> 00:55:34.468]  Hello, Alex.
[00:55:34.868 --> 00:55:35.109]  Hi.
[00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:44.633]  Last May, I seen him spraying chemtrails over the sky in Houston, and I called you up and I told you that I went to my next-door neighbor and I asked her...
[00:55:46.024 --> 00:55:50.468]  Her friend was on the Sheriff's Department, and I said, well, ask Robert if you can find out what's going on.
[00:55:50.508 --> 00:55:52.530]  She said, well, he has a friend in the Air Force.
[00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:54.812]  He'll ask him, you know.
[00:55:55.913 --> 00:55:59.676]  Well, he did, and he made some inquiries, and the word I got back was that they were testing a new weapon.
[00:56:00.677 --> 00:56:13.848]  Well, since that time, I'd moved further outside of Houston, out in the country, and when Hurricane Rita was coming in here, I happened to stop by just to check out, see how she was doing, and I made the comment, I said, I thought the government was behind these hurricanes with all this spraying up in the air.
[00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:17.004]  And she said, well, you never heard the rest of the story of what happened.
[00:56:17.304 --> 00:56:18.345]  I said, well, what was that?
[00:56:18.365 --> 00:56:28.034]  She said, well, some higher-ups in the Air Force found out that Robert's friend was making these inquiries about spraying, and they called him in there.
[00:56:28.915 --> 00:56:30.516]  And at first they asked him, well, how do you know this?
[00:56:30.736 --> 00:56:35.381]  And she said, well, or he said, I got a friend who has a friend that's seen him spraying in the sky.
[00:56:36.141 --> 00:56:39.124]  And they told him, they said, this is highest priority, top secret.
[00:56:39.878 --> 00:56:41.839]  You are not to make any more inquiries about this.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.182]  If you make any more inquiries or tell anybody else, you'll be court-martialed.
[00:56:46.243 --> 00:56:51.626]  And they also told the people, I guess, to give them the information, the same thing, and then they broke them up and transferred them to different bases around the country.
[00:56:51.687 --> 00:57:03.695]  Yeah, well, I don't like to speculate, and I don't like to... I mean, I appreciate your call, and it's interesting, John, and I appreciate it, but I mean, you know, now there'll be a story going around forever about this happening.
[00:57:03.715 --> 00:57:06.117]  What I like to do is focus on what we know.
[00:57:06.137 --> 00:57:07.238]  3,000-plus times...
[00:57:09.736 --> 00:57:13.901]  From the 40s until the late 70s, and then nothing's been declassified since then.
[00:57:15.303 --> 00:57:15.844]  Well, that's not true.
[00:57:15.864 --> 00:57:18.047]  There have been some other limited declassifications from the mid-80s.
[00:57:19.556 --> 00:57:27.221]  3,000 plus releases of radiation particles, radiologicals, chemicals, biologicals, deaths from San Francisco to New York.
[00:57:27.681 --> 00:57:32.223]  I mean, they would release bioweapons on the subway in 1968, killed a bunch of people, details.
[00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:40.528]  The numbers of deaths remain classified, but they had troops, medical doctors in the military, waiting to see what it would do and photographing it and writing notes.
[00:57:40.548 --> 00:57:47.312]  It was real fun, like you'd test a weapon on some goats or some pigs, which they also do, but, oh, they got tested on people.
[00:57:48.123 --> 00:57:52.694]  And then in the 80s with Project Shad, they did it on boats and ships and killed a lot of our troops.
[00:57:52.734 --> 00:57:53.916]  We've had some of the survivors on.
[00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:55.340]  That's been declassified.
[00:57:56.790 --> 00:57:57.530]  So there's a lot.
[00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:58.851]  Oh, you don't believe me out there listening?
[00:57:58.911 --> 00:58:03.312]  Just type Project Shad in and then hit the news part on Google and you'll get news.
[00:58:03.372 --> 00:58:03.972]  Forget the web.
[00:58:03.992 --> 00:58:04.652]  You don't believe that.
[00:58:05.152 --> 00:58:07.773]  Just go read the news articles about it.
[00:58:08.113 --> 00:58:13.454]  Oh, the government took the young army officer and asked him if he'd volunteer for some shore leave.
[00:58:13.594 --> 00:58:16.275]  If he'd go and stand in his chamber.
[00:58:16.555 --> 00:58:23.517]  And they nerve gassed him and they dissected his body and mailed it home to his parents and never told him that they dissected him and just said he died of the flu.
[00:58:24.591 --> 00:58:27.393]  Oh, but the government wouldn't carry out terror attacks.
[00:58:27.834 --> 00:58:29.255]  And yes, they're manipulating the weather.
[00:58:29.995 --> 00:58:33.878]  When you see the Kim Trails, you know those trails that stay there for five hours instead of two minutes?
[00:58:34.839 --> 00:58:36.740]  That's for weather modification generally.
[00:58:37.081 --> 00:58:37.781]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:45.947]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.400]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.161]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.841 --> 00:59:01.982]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.602 --> 00:59:03.422]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.183 --> 00:59:05.123]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.743 --> 00:59:09.425]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.925 --> 00:59:14.067]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.787 --> 00:59:20.650]  You know, I brought up a really important central point at the end of the last hour, and I don't want to rush over it.
[00:59:22.351 --> 00:59:25.232]  The father of weather wars and weather weapons coming up in five minutes.
[00:59:25.948 --> 00:59:26.970]  Take a few calls right now.
[00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.675]  Ben Levinson coming up with some updates for us, new information.
[00:59:30.695 --> 00:59:38.065]  A little more he's willing to talk about because he's so angry about the government not controlling and stopping hurricanes when in the 60s they'd proven they could.
[00:59:39.685 --> 00:59:54.151]  But our government, admittedly, the criminals that run it, have killed our own troops, our own citizens, in 3,000-plus chemical and biological tests that they've declassified here in the U.S., including radiating small children, claiming it was an X-ray, and actually killing G.I.s, small children.
[00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:59.854]  I mean, the government's got people that'll put a two-year-old baby in a radiator and radiate them.
[01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:01.991]  The radiation chamber.
[01:00:02.591 --> 01:00:03.091]  Don't believe me?
[01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:03.672]  Just type it in Google.
[01:00:03.712 --> 01:00:05.112]  A bunch of mainstream articles will pop up.
[01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:06.493]  Israel, the U.S.
[01:00:06.513 --> 01:00:07.073]  government paid them.
[01:00:07.093 --> 01:00:08.814]  They killed 110,000 of their own kids.
[01:00:09.215 --> 01:00:15.198]  How do any military, any cops, anybody listening right now, trust this government when all that's declassified?
[01:00:15.978 --> 01:00:16.979]  It isn't our government.
[01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:20.161]  And it isn't just a shadow government or a part of the government.
[01:00:20.261 --> 01:00:23.483]  It is a compartment, but they're the people in control.
[01:00:23.943 --> 01:00:24.863]  It's called the head.
[01:00:27.325 --> 01:00:27.445]  And...
[01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:30.335]  I mean, I rest my case.
[01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:33.816]  I don't even have to... What is there to debate here about this?
[01:00:34.236 --> 01:00:35.736]  Just the more I think about it, it's crazy.
[01:00:36.256 --> 01:00:36.856]  It's crazy.
[01:00:38.117 --> 01:00:41.897]  Let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Indiana.
[01:00:41.937 --> 01:00:42.658]  Randy, go ahead.
[01:00:42.778 --> 01:00:43.338]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:43.958]  How you doing?
[01:00:43.998 --> 01:00:44.358]  Good, sir.
[01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:50.159]  Hey, talking about the chemtrail, it's kind of freaky, the guy that just called before, because I was helping my grandpa one day.
[01:00:50.219 --> 01:00:53.860]  We were out driving around, and it looked like a pizza in the sky.
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.500]  The chemtrails had cut across.
[01:00:56.209 --> 01:00:58.510]  Looked like they were all converging on one point.
[01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.511]  They had crisscrossed.
[01:00:59.611 --> 01:01:01.572]  It was quite interesting there.
[01:01:02.852 --> 01:01:04.593]  Well, let me just add this for people who just joined us.
[01:01:04.813 --> 01:01:13.818]  The old condensation trails that form from 20,000 to 50,000 feet or higher, ice crystals disappear in a few minutes max, and then eight years ago it all changed.
[01:01:14.098 --> 01:01:16.599]  You'll have a jet right beside another jet not leaving a trail.
[01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:17.760]  Another jet will leave a trail.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.823]  In the middle of the summer at 3,000 feet where it's impossible to form ice crystals, and the thing is they're five hours later.
[01:01:25.343 --> 01:01:31.266]  I mean, I've seen it, I've videoed it, and then the government admits that there's some type of weird weather control thing going on.
[01:01:31.366 --> 01:01:33.927]  I don't know the full details, but yes, something's going on.
[01:01:34.167 --> 01:01:39.491]  But what I do know, again, I will get people to focus on it, is the admitted low-altitude spraying.
[01:01:39.851 --> 01:01:40.492]  Here's an example.
[01:01:40.532 --> 01:01:51.961]  Two years ago, all of Oklahoma was sprayed with Subtilis Globogy, a bacteria that can kill the old, young, infirm that causes spontaneous abortions in all mammalian species.
[01:01:52.811 --> 01:01:58.955]  Well, it just all ties in, like, with that, talking about the toll roads you were earlier in the week, how they would cut off small towns.
[01:01:58.975 --> 01:02:01.757]  I live in a small town, and I'm stuck in Carlisle Group Hell.
[01:02:01.777 --> 01:02:05.960]  My county, the county next to me, about 20,000 people, the two largest industries...
[01:02:20.956 --> 01:02:21.777]  They've openly said it.
[01:02:21.857 --> 01:02:25.779]  You won't be able to even get out of the cities without a special pass.
[01:02:48.022 --> 01:02:51.805]  And 80 plus percent of the country will be totally off limits.
[01:02:52.046 --> 01:02:53.127]  That has been in Congress.
[01:02:53.147 --> 01:02:54.708]  They've had the maps out in Congress.
[01:02:55.048 --> 01:02:56.589]  These toll roads are a small part of it.
[01:02:58.031 --> 01:03:00.092]  There's a couple of topics I had for you there.
[01:03:00.132 --> 01:03:02.094]  How do you just wake up some friends to this?
[01:03:02.214 --> 01:03:06.298]  Because I've got friends and they just absolutely think I'm nuts.
[01:03:06.558 --> 01:03:07.959]  They're mesmerized.
[01:03:08.059 --> 01:03:08.900]  I know they are.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.161]  I tell them that.
[01:03:10.281 --> 01:03:11.222]  I tell them that.
[01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:12.917]  Well, you know what?
[01:03:12.937 --> 01:03:14.798]  They're going to get hit upside the head by reality.
[01:03:15.138 --> 01:03:17.280]  Well, oh, I know, and I tell them that, too.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:22.464]  It's like, you know, I hope you're in camp with me, and don't tell me I told you so, you know, somewhere at the FEMA camp.
[01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:25.926]  I actually live in a city that has... Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:03:25.946 --> 01:03:28.348]  Look, I got Ben coming on for about 30 minutes or so.
[01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.350]  If you want to hold, it sounds like you have more to say, Randy.
[01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:30.670]  You're welcome.
[01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:31.651]  If you've got to go, you've got to go.
[01:03:31.671 --> 01:03:32.691]  You want to stay or go?
[01:03:32.711 --> 01:03:35.153]  You going to stay there, Randy?
[01:03:35.193 --> 01:03:35.994]  Yeah, I'll stay here.
[01:03:36.134 --> 01:03:37.175]  And then we'll go to Jason and...
[01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:39.963]  Pat and Dave and many others that are holding later.
[01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:41.225]  Got Ben coming up.
[01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:42.927]  He just wanted to come on with some updates.
[01:03:43.508 --> 01:03:45.190]  Father of using weather weapons.
[01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.092]  Very important information.
[01:03:47.132 --> 01:03:48.353]  They can stop hurricanes.
[01:03:48.373 --> 01:03:49.194]  They can knock them out.
[01:03:49.214 --> 01:03:51.076]  They can reduce them massively.
[01:03:51.096 --> 01:03:51.797]  Not going to happen.
[01:03:51.857 --> 01:03:51.957]  Why?
[01:03:53.436 --> 01:03:57.783]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.983 --> 01:04:02.410]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:06.917]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.957 --> 01:04:08.319]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:09.801]  Can emerge.
[01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:14.305]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.365 --> 01:04:21.312]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.432 --> 01:04:23.454]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.814 --> 01:04:34.242]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:39.807]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:45.371]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:55.777]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.097 --> 01:04:58.879]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.139 --> 01:05:03.302]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.723 --> 01:05:04.563]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.864 --> 01:05:09.447]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.927 --> 01:05:12.049]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:13.410]  Sheltering in place.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:27.230]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:34.415]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:05:52.731 --> 01:05:54.191]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:05:54.552 --> 01:05:58.493]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:05:58.873 --> 01:06:02.394]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:06:02.774 --> 01:06:06.315]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[01:06:06.715 --> 01:06:11.577]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:17.720]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:24.163]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:06:24.483 --> 01:06:30.246]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:31.866]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:06:32.186 --> 01:06:33.307]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:33.387 --> 01:06:38.808]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[01:06:39.008 --> 01:06:42.469]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:06:42.769 --> 01:06:44.049]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:44.369]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:06:53.286 --> 01:06:58.331]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.692 --> 01:07:00.974]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:10.133 --> 01:07:11.894]  We're good to go.
[01:07:36.883 --> 01:07:38.104]  We're good to go.
[01:07:38.144 --> 01:07:38.484]  We're good to go.
[01:08:06.813 --> 01:08:10.459]  And I'm sorry, you're not going to hear about Michael Jackson here, some of you out there that like that.
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.643]  He's got a hundred other stations around him, I'm sure, that do that.
[01:08:13.663 --> 01:08:16.267]  You're not going to hear about how dumb Hillary is.
[01:08:16.327 --> 01:08:17.509]  We know she's dumb.
[01:08:17.929 --> 01:08:19.672]  We know they're all bought off and paid for.
[01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:25.891]  We get into the serious nitty-gritty of what's happening.
[01:08:25.911 --> 01:08:31.155]  And bottom line, they can massively reduce, in today's technology, knock out hurricanes.
[01:08:31.196 --> 01:08:32.256]  It's totally documented.
[01:08:32.557 --> 01:08:32.997]  They don't.
[01:08:33.057 --> 01:08:38.922]  The answer is because they want to hand out hundreds of billions of dollars that's through the central government to their cronies.
[01:08:39.362 --> 01:08:42.925]  They don't want a free market, and that's the conclusion Ben Livingston's come to.
[01:08:42.965 --> 01:08:43.065]  Now,
[01:08:43.954 --> 01:08:55.562]  I've got articles up on Infowars.com right now about today's guest, who first went public in a couple of newspapers in the Midland area, and then on the radio here.
[01:08:55.642 --> 01:08:59.164]  But Ben Livingston, cloud physicist, has an eye on hurricane control.
[01:08:59.224 --> 01:09:01.586]  That was one of the first articles back in September of last year.
[01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:05.012]  And then, of course, we have this article.
[01:09:05.092 --> 01:09:08.353]  Former naval physicist, government can control hurricanes.
[01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:10.635]  Former vet, made it rain during Vietnam.
[01:09:10.655 --> 01:09:14.936]  That's an article Steve Watson and Paul Watson put together, and it went into the things he did.
[01:09:15.357 --> 01:09:19.879]  Ben, it's good to have you back with us, and for those that don't know who you are, spend a few minutes.
[01:09:19.919 --> 01:09:21.659]  I know you don't like to brag on yourself.
[01:09:21.719 --> 01:09:26.702]  Frankly, you talk yourself down, but you are the father of using weather weapons.
[01:09:27.102 --> 01:09:29.063]  You didn't develop cloud-sitting technology.
[01:09:29.083 --> 01:09:31.524]  You just first used it in war, and again...
[01:09:32.404 --> 01:09:39.808]  Stanford Studies, Pentagon Studies, you did flood out the Viet Cong with record rains in the dry season using nothing.
[01:09:40.448 --> 01:09:48.513]  You did fly into typhoons and 200-something mile-an-hour winds long before these people were bragging about flying into hurricanes and high-tech planes.
[01:09:49.173 --> 01:09:51.014]  You did have sand missiles shot at you.
[01:09:51.869 --> 01:09:55.691]  You were the head of the Naval Research Laboratory.
[01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:58.872]  You did brief President Johnson.
[01:09:59.193 --> 01:10:09.518]  You are the father of using weather weapons, and you got the Stanford Research Institute to certify that you guys massively reduced hurricanes, but it was never used.
[01:10:09.558 --> 01:10:16.581]  But I want you, in your own words, to give us a synopsis of who Ben Livingston is and why you're going public.
[01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:21.296]  Well, I am what you said I am.
[01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:30.898]  I have over three years experience in flying typhoon reconnaissance and research in the Pacific.
[01:10:32.038 --> 01:10:43.540]  Two and a half years of flying typhoon research and weather modification in the Atlantic Ocean, operating out of the Hurricane Hunter Squadron from Jacksonville.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.561]  I was a
[01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:56.635]  The national military representative on the Storm Fury Advisory Board wrote the operations plan for Project Storm Fury.
[01:10:57.236 --> 01:11:08.963]  And in that project, of course, our objective was to demonstrate that we could, in fact, reduce the maximum winds in hurricanes.
[01:11:10.864 --> 01:11:12.646]  That was a very successful operation.
[01:11:13.026 --> 01:11:14.967]  And as you said in your introduction a while ago,
[01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:18.871]  It was certified.
[01:11:19.552 --> 01:11:22.975]  Those operations were certified by Stanford Research Institute.
[01:11:23.756 --> 01:11:30.583]  And they had a conclusion, a public conclusion, if you will.
[01:11:30.944 --> 01:11:35.529]  And if you don't mind, I'll just read it.
[01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:39.613]  Here's what they said about the government.
[01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:53.722]  And I would also, before you do that, add that many of the top, recognized, top meteorologists in the world have certified that these systems conclusively work as well, and you have that in your book as well.
[01:11:54.222 --> 01:11:55.303]  Yes, I do have.
[01:11:55.463 --> 01:12:08.173]  And I might mention two names here of people who, outstanding meteorologists and scientists that directed Project Storm Fury in its formative years and its successful years,
[01:12:09.085 --> 01:12:22.728]  And I think because of their strong feelings about how successful it was, which did not fit in the mainstream of some of the other scientists, they were actually purged from the system.
[01:12:23.349 --> 01:12:36.272]  But these two scientists, one of them, Dr. Joanne Simpson, has been recognized as the top tropical meteorologist in the world in 2021.
[01:12:39.056 --> 01:12:44.560]  That is quite a title, quite a recognition.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:59.028]  But those two people, she and her husband started this program and operated it for years and helped develop the techniques and materials and so forth that are needed to reduce the damage from hurricanes.
[01:13:00.089 --> 01:13:05.292]  But some of the scientists involved in the program at the National
[01:13:05.951 --> 01:13:20.023]  Oceanic and the Atmospheric Administration weren't ready to accept cloud seeding of hurricanes or seeding of hurricanes as a practical operation.
[01:13:20.103 --> 01:13:28.871]  Why don't you go ahead and go back, though, I interrupted you, and read that particular part where the Stanford Research Institute reported on what you did off the East Coast.
[01:13:28.991 --> 01:13:29.431]  Okay.
[01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:32.814]  Well, here's what the Stanford Research Institute had to say.
[01:13:32.834 --> 01:13:33.895]  Quote,
[01:13:34.623 --> 01:13:44.948]  They may have to accept responsibility for not seating and thereby exposing the public to higher probabilities of severe storm damage and possible higher death tolls.
[01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:50.631]  We claim they should consider seating now if a big hurricane comes straight from Miami.
[01:13:51.271 --> 01:13:51.771]  And that was in 1970.
[01:13:54.921 --> 01:13:56.462]  And again, I've read your book.
[01:13:56.502 --> 01:13:57.442]  It just goes on and on.
[01:13:57.462 --> 01:14:01.423]  And I've been there with you in the hotel room with stacks of documents out of your briefcase.
[01:14:01.463 --> 01:14:04.945]  And I've gone and personally researched them myself.
[01:14:05.045 --> 01:14:06.985]  But, you know, we talked last time.
[01:14:07.446 --> 01:14:11.567]  And you called up and said you wanted to come back on because you're getting even more angry about what's happening.
[01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.808]  Let's specifically talk about just briefly.
[01:14:14.988 --> 01:14:17.349]  Ben, I mean, you said it yourself without me even prompting it.
[01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:19.550]  And that's what was in my heart and in my mind.
[01:14:20.638 --> 01:14:23.079]  They want to hand out $200 billion from Katrina.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.122]  They want it to be really bad because that brings political control over who gets that money.
[01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:34.466]  I mean, $200 billion, folks, that's more than all the money spent and taxed in Texas.
[01:14:35.752 --> 01:14:37.413]  A couple years, or in California.
[01:14:37.713 --> 01:14:41.656]  I mean, we're talking about, I mean, the entire Pentagon budget is $600 billion.
[01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:46.259]  We're talking about a lot of money handed out to a lot of cronies and a lot of friends, to Halliburton and others.
[01:14:47.079 --> 01:14:52.983]  And there they are in the Stanford Research Institute, saying that this is the real deal.
[01:14:53.504 --> 01:14:56.846]  And look, for those that don't know, you've gone over this before.
[01:14:57.086 --> 01:14:59.888]  First talk about that, and then I want to get into the fact, Ben.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.081]  Well, we'll cover the second point in a second.
[01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:12.225]  Go ahead and cover that first one about why in your gut you think they don't want to allow this to be used now to substantively weaken these hurricanes.
[01:15:13.446 --> 01:15:24.992]  Well, some months ago it was in my mind that the Senators and even their President may not know the real facts or truth of what went on in Project Storm Fury and results begot.
[01:15:25.712 --> 01:15:30.335]  So to counter that, I sent a letter to each of the hundred Senators and a
[01:15:31.348 --> 01:15:43.298]  A separate letter to the President of the United States in which I gave him the facts of Project Storm Fury and some other thoughts on how the technology needed to be used or could be used and who could use it and apply it.
[01:15:44.359 --> 01:15:48.102]  I got, from those hundred senators, I got a reply from six of them.
[01:15:49.383 --> 01:15:54.067]  Two of the six just said they wouldn't really want to talk to me because I'm not one of their constituents.
[01:15:56.129 --> 01:15:59.231]  One of them, Senator Trent Lott, advised the...
[01:16:00.484 --> 01:16:11.751]  Chairman of a subcommittee that he thought this should be looked into, and that was the only substantive letter I received from the 100 senators on this situation.
[01:16:12.252 --> 01:16:23.699]  So I then came to the conclusion, the absolute conclusion, that the senators and me and the president just may not give a darn.
[01:16:25.768 --> 01:16:27.888]  Just let it go ahead and blow everybody away.
[01:16:27.968 --> 01:16:39.991]  The insurance industries, the energy industries, some of the major building companies and so forth stand to make and do make a lot of money from these stores.
[01:16:40.011 --> 01:16:48.912]  Yeah, contrary to popular belief, insurance companies just jack up prices even more than they need to, and they get government bailouts, and they end up actually making money out of these type of events.
[01:16:49.312 --> 01:16:52.473]  And then certainly the construction industries and the cronies and the rest of them
[01:16:53.073 --> 01:16:55.514]  And then now that's becoming even clearer, but I want to be specific.
[01:16:55.534 --> 01:17:00.236]  A lot of idiots say drop a nuke on a hurricane.
[01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:01.797]  That really wouldn't do anything.
[01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:04.298]  In fact, research shows, as you said, that might even make it stronger.
[01:17:04.698 --> 01:17:05.279]  It's simple.
[01:17:05.339 --> 01:17:17.064]  Talk about those engines, those cells that are in the hurricane, and all you've got to do is go in and target with planes those energy cells in the main right front quadrant.
[01:17:17.104 --> 01:17:18.805]  Explain how these things work.
[01:17:20.521 --> 01:17:37.869]  Well, of course, a hurricane is composed of several major engines you just referred to, the engines which are extremely big cloud formations that are more or less independent until they come together or are blown together and they become an engine.
[01:17:38.789 --> 01:17:44.692]  Any engine, if you destroy a cylinder in it, becomes less efficient.
[01:17:45.512 --> 01:17:48.594]  That's the theory and the actual application
[01:17:49.524 --> 01:18:08.278]  ... of the cloud seeding material to these individual sails in a very restricted right front quadrant of a hurricane reduces the wind velocity of that storm or in other words it effectively
[01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:13.688]  Reduces the effectiveness of the cylinders in that storm.
[01:18:13.808 --> 01:18:18.232]  Now, you said you conclusively showed 30 to 40 percent reductions.
[01:18:18.292 --> 01:18:27.740]  Reductions of that level, I mean, you take a storm down from 130 miles an hour to even 100 miles an hour, it's that 100 to 130 where most of the death and destruction is caused.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:35.326]  Yes, well, I believe Dr. Mike Garstang said it best in one of those Senate hearings.
[01:18:36.013 --> 01:18:49.220]  And he said he told the Senators that some of the research that emerged from Project Storm Fury indicated that cloud cheating could reduce a hurricane's strength by as much as 15%, which mathematically means reducing the storm's destructive power exponentially.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:49.760]  Stay there.
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.220]  Stay there.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:50.820]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.741]  Talk about the Senate hearings.
[01:18:54.727 --> 01:18:59.230]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:59.591 --> 01:19:03.674]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:03.974 --> 01:19:04.514]  We listened.
[01:19:04.834 --> 01:19:09.798]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:10.579]  We listened.
[01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:14.001]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:14.942]  We listened.
[01:19:15.402 --> 01:19:19.464]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:19.844 --> 01:19:20.324]  We listened.
[01:19:20.685 --> 01:19:25.907]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:26.327 --> 01:19:27.708]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:28.048 --> 01:19:35.431]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:22:54.179 --> 01:22:59.302]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.003 --> 01:23:02.364]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:15.033]  So now Ben Livingston, who'd been out of politics and government for a long time, advised the president, been on the national board, been over entire military research facilities for the largest in the country.
[01:23:15.902 --> 01:23:26.824]  He's now been researching and investigating and reading the legislation that's being introduced by Kay Baby from out here in Texas, one of our senators along with Cornyn, and then now he's read some of the hearings that I didn't even know about.
[01:23:26.844 --> 01:23:27.964]  There's so much going on.
[01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:32.545]  Last year, where this very stuff's being brought up, now we know they do know.
[01:23:32.585 --> 01:23:33.665]  They're not just ignorant.
[01:23:34.345 --> 01:23:35.465]  Ben, please continue.
[01:23:36.405 --> 01:23:41.206]  Well, I was just quoting from the senatorial hearings, a statement made by Mike Garstang,
[01:23:46.343 --> 01:23:47.705]  Who is a Ph.D.
[01:23:47.765 --> 01:23:48.406]  meteorologist.
[01:23:49.088 --> 01:23:56.220]  But Garstang also said that newer computer models also show how hurricanes can be controlled.
[01:23:56.866 --> 01:24:02.929]  These models are focusing on the very small effects that might have quite drastic consequences on a hurricane.
[01:24:03.389 --> 01:24:07.350]  And then again, for those that missed it, we're posting it on Infowars.com back on the main page.
[01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:08.071]  It's on the site.
[01:24:08.371 --> 01:24:10.692]  Tell people the particular date of those hearings.
[01:24:11.252 --> 01:24:16.374]  Those hearings, the report was made on December the 8th, 2005.
[01:24:20.016 --> 01:24:21.236]  And that was in the Senate hearings.
[01:24:21.276 --> 01:24:23.777]  Yeah, it was the Senate hearings, www.foxnews.com.
[01:24:27.452 --> 01:24:28.072]  Unbelievable.
[01:24:28.612 --> 01:24:29.032]  Okay.
[01:24:29.692 --> 01:24:31.613]  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
[01:24:31.793 --> 01:24:36.654]  The content of these hearings is absolutely unbelievable.
[01:24:36.694 --> 01:24:41.854]  You know, what's interesting is I had you on the air a few months before this, and we're talking about it, and then I missed it.
[01:24:41.874 --> 01:24:46.615]  We never heard that they had hearings, and we're basically saying what we said, but still nothing's going to be done.
[01:24:46.635 --> 01:24:47.815]  That's right.
[01:24:49.076 --> 01:24:53.957]  But, you know, in these hearings, Senator DeMint said...
[01:24:57.296 --> 01:25:06.462]  This is a fascinating subject to me, and the idea that we can actually impact weather is exciting, and I guess, frightening in some ways.
[01:25:07.042 --> 01:25:10.464]  And that's what Senator DeMint said, and he was the chair of this committee.
[01:25:10.804 --> 01:25:21.751]  You know, I think it's safe to say, Ben, you going public earlier last year, and then later in the year, we talking about it, and you going on Coast to Coast AM, I think that spurred them to have these hearings.
[01:25:22.549 --> 01:25:25.952]  Well, I hope it did because something desperate needs to be done.
[01:25:27.293 --> 01:25:45.728]  But he also went on to say that during these November hearings on a bill that could start up federal weather modification research project, that project was started and funded first in 1954. 1954.
[01:25:49.837 --> 01:25:53.021]  And continued unabated through last year.
[01:25:53.521 --> 01:25:55.744]  When did you first get involved in that project?
[01:25:55.764 --> 01:26:09.339]  I first got involved in the project officially in 1963 when I was advised by the Navy personnel people that I would be going to a hurricane hunter squadron, if you will,
[01:26:10.969 --> 01:26:13.070]  The next year, which was 1964.
[01:26:13.190 --> 01:26:18.472]  Then you began testing the technologies that you then used against the Vietnamese, the communists.
[01:26:19.292 --> 01:26:33.756]  Just briefly talk about that, because they have history channel specials and weather channel specials about eight feet of water and flooding them in the dry season and the cloud seeding, but you were the guy up there doing it and training the other crews how to do it.
[01:26:34.637 --> 01:26:34.957]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:34.997 --> 01:26:38.338]  Well, during the first season, the first fall season, we were there...
[01:26:39.806 --> 01:26:49.893]  Essentially at the end of the monsoon with the intent and purpose of extending the rainfall for another month or two at the end of the monsoon season.
[01:26:50.534 --> 01:26:53.656]  So I was the only person doing that flying during that year.
[01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:56.438]  It was a highly classified project, if you will.
[01:26:57.178 --> 01:27:07.826]  But it was also during the first 13, 14 days of that project that the Joint Chiefs of Staff took up the subject of using weather control as a weapon system.
[01:27:08.613 --> 01:27:20.496]  And in November of the same year, I was asked to report back to the President of the United States on the outcome of the cloud cheating events in Vietnam.
[01:27:20.716 --> 01:27:21.816]  And you did that in person?
[01:27:22.376 --> 01:27:27.978]  I went there in person, and the reason this project was effective was that we...
[01:27:30.356 --> 01:27:36.319]  Use onboard aircraft instrumentation to sample each cloud before I did anything with it.
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:39.581]  Before and after, so you had the scientific data right there.
[01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:40.942]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:27:41.062 --> 01:27:42.663]  I didn't need a cloud model.
[01:27:43.163 --> 01:27:45.564]  I couldn't use a cloud model because there were none.
[01:27:46.305 --> 01:27:48.306]  And this was active, pure research?
[01:27:49.086 --> 01:27:52.748]  Yeah, this was pure research.
[01:27:53.609 --> 01:27:59.152]  I had a general, a good knowledge, if you will, of the physics of most clouds, of kind of how they work.
[01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:05.112]  And I'd spent many years, if you will, inside clouds, taking data, studying them and so forth.
[01:28:06.132 --> 01:28:13.895]  But in Vietnam, where I had to apply this knowledge, I didn't have anything besides some simple...
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:22.004]  On board aircraft instruments in which I could determine if a cloud needed to be seated to make it rain or if it should be left alone.
[01:28:22.505 --> 01:28:23.165]  This sort of thing.
[01:28:23.285 --> 01:28:35.252]  You also took photos out of the gun camera of the little bitty cloud that you then built into a giant thunderhead that then turned into a huge storm that totally knocked out the enemy Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[01:28:35.833 --> 01:28:36.333]  Stay there, Ben.
[01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:38.814]  I want to come back and do a few more minutes and talk about the Senate hearings.
[01:28:39.155 --> 01:28:40.375]  Talk about what we can do.
[01:28:40.395 --> 01:28:43.057]  And then your calls are coming up with a ton of other news items.
[01:28:43.783 --> 01:28:44.664]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.165 --> 01:28:46.767]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:32:27.191 --> 01:32:37.704]  And when you get The Order of Death, absolutely free with it comes the updated Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, my original film when I first infiltrated back in July 15th.
[01:32:39.133 --> 01:32:39.213]  Of 2000.

[01:34:08.785 --> 01:34:11.026]  We do interviews in studio at least once a week.
[01:34:11.898 --> 01:34:13.339]  And put those up on the web.
[01:34:13.359 --> 01:34:20.141]  It's just such an important website, such an important site for the members, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:20.601 --> 01:34:35.107]  It's also a great activist site, because you can go download the videos, burn them on DVD, dump them to VHS, give them to people, put them on local cable access television, have an effect, engage in the info war, defend America, defend the Bill of Rights.
[01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:38.529]  The Constitution, and it all starts at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:49.117]  And, of course, you can always write to me via snail mail at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:34:49.537 --> 01:34:54.180]  Let me just add a little program note here.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:56.162]  No matter how much I say this, it doesn't seem to matter.
[01:34:57.623 --> 01:35:00.145]  I do not have an office at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:04.361 --> 01:35:08.965]  There is a locked mail drop-off there that the post office drops into.
[01:35:08.985 --> 01:35:12.068]  I've been using it now for about 10 years.
[01:35:12.708 --> 01:35:15.771]  I had an office down the street that was private because it was so small.
[01:35:16.592 --> 01:35:18.934]  Because, frankly, I can't have 50 people a day coming into my office.
[01:35:18.954 --> 01:35:19.754]  I won't get any work done.
[01:35:21.496 --> 01:35:23.097]  Now I've gotten a bigger office.
[01:35:23.337 --> 01:35:25.779]  I'm going to put a bookstore in the front of it, I think.
[01:35:25.819 --> 01:35:30.964]  Sometimes I think I don't want a bunch of crowds here, but I also like seeing people who come busy working all the time.
[01:35:31.937 --> 01:35:38.261]  You can't come to my office right now, folks, because we don't have couches or bookshelves or the cash register up front right now.
[01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:41.823]  We're busy in the back making films and doing radio shows, and my studio's here.
[01:35:42.644 --> 01:35:47.187]  And there's like ten people a day coming by that other office, and I don't have an office there.
[01:35:47.207 --> 01:35:50.829]  I have a mail drop, and they go into the office and go, I want to see Alex Jones.
[01:35:50.849 --> 01:35:52.010]  And they go, Alex Jones isn't here.
[01:35:52.230 --> 01:35:52.970]  Yeah, he is.
[01:35:53.611 --> 01:35:57.153]  And then they drag people up from there, and it's really become a problem.
[01:35:57.814 --> 01:36:01.416]  And I've told people this, and I guess they just don't care.
[01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:03.211]  Or it just doesn't matter.
[01:36:03.351 --> 01:36:04.293]  They're not listening to the show.
[01:36:04.313 --> 01:36:05.776]  And so...
[01:36:08.613 --> 01:36:10.734]  And I'll tell you, folks, I'm not trying to be mean about it.
[01:36:10.754 --> 01:36:13.616]  I know most of you are great folks and care less about coming into my office.
[01:36:14.016 --> 01:36:15.036]  And that's kind of how I like it.
[01:36:15.096 --> 01:36:17.578]  But we're going to have a bookstore here and it will all be welcome to come into it.
[01:36:18.058 --> 01:36:20.279]  But I can't like say, here's an example.
[01:36:20.299 --> 01:36:21.119]  It's a TV studio.
[01:36:21.159 --> 01:36:21.880]  I'm doing it every week.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:28.123]  It's not like a conventional TV studio with a fence around it and everything's locked up and I drive in and go into a TV show.
[01:36:28.183 --> 01:36:31.345]  No, you can walk right in, right into the control room where I'm at.
[01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.586]  My bad, people just open the door and I'm live on TV.
[01:36:34.466 --> 01:36:36.528]  When I forget to lock it, hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:36:36.568 --> 01:36:37.689]  Just scrolling right on in.
[01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:42.014]  It's just there's some type of disconnect with reality on this.
[01:36:42.794 --> 01:36:45.837]  And there I've said it and I'm going to shut up now.
[01:36:46.638 --> 01:36:50.001]  I'm not whining about it that I'm being bothered so much.
[01:36:50.342 --> 01:36:50.982]  I'm not into that.
[01:36:51.062 --> 01:36:53.144]  It's just that it's really become an irritation.
[01:36:53.965 --> 01:36:55.166]  And there I've said it.
[01:36:55.487 --> 01:36:58.830]  It'd be like if you were at work and I just showed up and said, hey!
[01:37:00.242 --> 01:37:00.982]  What you doing there?
[01:37:01.583 --> 01:37:03.403]  All the time I get all these great people.
[01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:04.163]  They email me.
[01:37:04.884 --> 01:37:05.884]  Business leaders.
[01:37:06.184 --> 01:37:08.945]  Even really nice, famous folks in some cases.
[01:37:09.305 --> 01:37:10.426]  Who themselves ought to know.
[01:37:10.486 --> 01:37:11.726]  It's like, hey, go to lunch with me.
[01:37:12.066 --> 01:37:12.667]  Well, I can't do it.
[01:37:12.687 --> 01:37:13.087]  Well, why not?
[01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:13.967]  Well, I'm on the radio at lunch.
[01:37:13.987 --> 01:37:14.787]  Well, come to dinner with me.
[01:37:14.827 --> 01:37:15.728]  Well, I'm working at dinner.
[01:37:16.228 --> 01:37:19.029]  Well, come to... And then they get mad at you.
[01:37:19.705 --> 01:37:20.946]  Or I get a letter.
[01:37:20.986 --> 01:37:22.427]  You didn't respond to my last letter.
[01:37:22.467 --> 01:37:23.687]  And sure enough, I'd read the letter.
[01:37:23.707 --> 01:37:25.768]  It takes hours every day to read all the mail, but I'd do it.
[01:37:26.389 --> 01:37:27.810]  Or read an email.
[01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:29.050]  Well, you didn't respond to me.
[01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:30.051]  I hate you now.
[01:37:30.491 --> 01:37:32.412]  Jeb Bush sent me an email back.
[01:37:32.832 --> 01:37:34.313]  Remember one time I had a caller to the show?
[01:37:35.474 --> 01:37:38.816]  You don't respond to my emails, but Jeb Bush sent me an email back.
[01:37:39.136 --> 01:37:43.358]  Yeah, an auto-respond, and the caller said, no, it was personal.
[01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:44.739]  Maybe from a...
[01:37:45.692 --> 01:37:51.256]  What I'm getting at here is I know most of you don't care and I love you to death, but some people get mad that I don't respond to every phone call.
[01:37:51.576 --> 01:37:52.817]  I don't respond to every letter.
[01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:55.498]  I don't respond to every... I can't, folks.
[01:37:55.999 --> 01:37:58.060]  If I had 50 employees, I couldn't.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:37:58.901]  And I don't.
[01:37:58.921 --> 01:38:00.281]  I've got eight employees total.
[01:38:01.182 --> 01:38:02.063]  And we're working.
[01:38:02.123 --> 01:38:02.963]  Believe me, folks.
[01:38:03.223 --> 01:38:07.966]  I was, you know... I mean, tonight I'll be on Coast to Coast AM until 4 AM.
[01:38:10.388 --> 01:38:11.429]  Actually, until 5 AM.
[01:38:12.850 --> 01:38:12.930]  I'll...
[01:38:14.568 --> 01:38:17.833]  I'll be up in three hours getting ready for this radio show tomorrow.
[01:38:18.233 --> 01:38:20.096]  And I'm not tooting my horn saying I'm great.
[01:38:20.196 --> 01:38:22.379]  It's just that every day I get calls.
[01:38:22.419 --> 01:38:23.520]  You need to make a film about this.
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:24.782]  You need to interview me about that.
[01:38:24.842 --> 01:38:25.903]  It's just you need to do this.
[01:38:25.944 --> 01:38:26.384]  You need to do that.
[01:38:26.664 --> 01:38:27.265]  Folks, believe me.
[01:38:27.345 --> 01:38:29.889]  I think some of you out there need to do a little bit more.
[01:38:30.569 --> 01:38:34.332]  Okay, now I've done my little three-minute rant, and I apologize to Ben Livingston for having to hear that.
[01:38:34.652 --> 01:38:35.533]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:38:36.233 --> 01:38:39.416]  Ben, I was going over some pet peeves there that I've never really talked about on air.
[01:38:39.456 --> 01:38:41.838]  I probably shouldn't have done it, but so what?
[01:38:42.118 --> 01:38:43.159]  We're all having fun here.
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:53.286]  Ben, it's got to be refreshing, though, to at least see the things you've said now being talked about in Senate hearings and being discussed on Fox television.
[01:38:55.908 --> 01:38:57.509]  Ben, how'd it take you?
[01:38:57.569 --> 01:38:58.150]  Mr. Jones?
[01:38:58.695 --> 01:38:58.915]  Yes.
[01:38:58.955 --> 01:38:59.835]  This is Ben's son.
[01:39:00.256 --> 01:39:01.976]  He's coming back from right now.
[01:39:01.996 --> 01:39:03.377]  He had to go visit the restroom.
[01:39:03.757 --> 01:39:04.457]  I understand that.
[01:39:04.477 --> 01:39:05.458]  But here he is right now.
[01:39:07.118 --> 01:39:08.199]  Hey, sorry about that.
[01:39:08.239 --> 01:39:12.820]  Hey, this long-winded Austinites blabbering, you need to go relieve yourself.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.342]  Well, I thought, well, he'll be through in a second, and I'll just wait.
[01:39:16.782 --> 01:39:17.422]  Hey, that's fine.
[01:39:18.222 --> 01:39:27.446]  Ben, it's got to feel good to now at least see the Senate talking about it, Fox News talking about it, a new bill to create a national weather control program.
[01:39:27.506 --> 01:39:27.806]  Mm-hmm.
[01:39:28.586 --> 01:39:29.127]  Well, I do.
[01:39:29.587 --> 01:39:38.476]  And I think it's interesting to note what Wesley Denton, who is Senator Demence's aide, said.
[01:39:38.496 --> 01:39:44.262]  Quote, This plan deserves further consideration, but a time of serious deficits.
[01:39:44.762 --> 01:39:50.007]  We must delay committing additional funds to this project until we have more time to consider its merits.
[01:39:51.328 --> 01:39:52.750]  They must realize.
[01:39:53.422 --> 01:40:15.333]  That inaction or failure to accept an offer from civilian people with appropriate equipment, materials, and so forth, would represent an investment of about $100,000 to $1 in one quarter of a year had they accepted our plan last year.
[01:40:16.913 --> 01:40:17.834]  We wouldn't have had...
[01:40:19.564 --> 01:40:21.625]  The dam around New Orleans failing.
[01:40:21.785 --> 01:40:26.188]  We wouldn't have that $20 to $100 billion debt just staring us in the face.
[01:40:26.568 --> 01:40:28.429]  Oh, they're saying total cost is going to be $200 billion.
[01:40:28.469 --> 01:40:38.894]  Well, okay, but you see, I would like to ask the question, if they aren't going to try to do something physically about the problem, why are they building it back?
[01:40:39.134 --> 01:40:40.355]  Well, let me just stop you right there.
[01:40:41.167 --> 01:40:44.890]  You know, you talk about how they said they needed to study it and look at it for another decade or so.
[01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:50.915]  As you said, it was already demonstrated, certified, documented to work in the late 1960s.
[01:40:51.075 --> 01:40:53.116]  Yes, that's right.
[01:40:53.317 --> 01:41:00.843]  And in my letter that I sent to senators this year, I actually sent them a proposal to do this work for the fiscal year 2006.
[01:41:00.963 --> 01:41:04.966]  Because we have no guarantees it's not going to happen again.
[01:41:04.986 --> 01:41:05.046]  And...
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.122]  That's where I come up with the numbers of 100,000 to 1.
[01:41:10.343 --> 01:41:16.227]  Well, as a weatherman, what do you make of a tropical storm in the Atlantic going into the North Atlantic right now, or the Mid-Atlantic?
[01:41:16.527 --> 01:41:20.570]  What do you make of tropical depressions forming right now in the Caribbean?
[01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:22.572]  I mean, that's not in modern history, is it?
[01:41:24.193 --> 01:41:31.859]  Oh, I don't know what's been reported in the past and what's being reported now that the satellites uncover.
[01:41:32.916 --> 01:41:37.280]  But there are some physical things in the Atlantic Ocean that keep hurricanes from coming to the U.S.
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:40.343]  coast, and they don't exist in the wintertime.
[01:41:40.903 --> 01:41:42.705]  So I think it's really of no concern.
[01:41:42.805 --> 01:41:56.017]  But one of the things that I'm really concerned about is why have we not tried to prevent or reduce the effects of a hurricane in the first few days
[01:41:57.068 --> 01:41:58.448]  Yeah, let me ask you this question.
[01:41:58.508 --> 01:42:09.531]  Is it better to knock one out when it's first forming or before it forms when you see a probable storm getting rotation or is it better to wait until it comes in close to the coast and then hit it hard?
[01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:20.434]  Well, see, I think the answer to that question would be, and we have no experience with this, to reduce the damage of the thing or the velocity of the hurricane before it ever gets close to the U.S.
[01:42:20.474 --> 01:42:20.814]  coast.
[01:42:21.475 --> 01:42:26.236]  Otherwise, all of the work that we would do as physical
[01:42:26.966 --> 01:42:32.548]  Well, if you're talking about the storm fury hurricanes, all those experiments took place far enough off the coast
[01:42:57.153 --> 01:43:04.034]  To ensure that whatever results occurred from the experiments didn't come ashore and cause problems.
[01:43:04.835 --> 01:43:10.696]  Because you didn't know, I mean, you thought you knew what happened from past experience with clouds, but you weren't sure, so to be safe you did it.
[01:43:11.056 --> 01:43:13.456]  I mean, it's kind of like testing A-bombs out in Nevada.
[01:43:13.717 --> 01:43:15.097]  You do it out where there's nobody around.
[01:43:15.177 --> 01:43:16.217]  That's exactly right.
[01:43:16.537 --> 01:43:25.059]  And whether or not that was necessary, I don't know, but it was certainly prudent to not push your luck on it.
[01:43:25.729 --> 01:43:30.270]  And so we did those things way off the coast, if you will, 800 miles or so.
[01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:35.811]  And according to the reports I've read, the declassified ones in the public reports, I mean, it worked like a charm.
[01:43:35.851 --> 01:43:37.792]  You knocked those suckers down massively.
[01:43:38.072 --> 01:43:46.993]  Well, we knocked them down by about an average of about 25% in wind velocity, which is between a reduction of 40% and 60% of damage reduction.
[01:43:47.634 --> 01:43:53.155]  So if you take any big storm and reduce its damage potential by 40% or 50%,
[01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:57.110]  It's not really all that terrible anymore.
[01:43:57.590 --> 01:44:00.011]  Now, I'm going from memory on this.
[01:44:00.131 --> 01:44:04.712]  Don't the new planes carry, did you say 500 or 800 times what the old planes carry?
[01:44:04.732 --> 01:44:23.395]  Well, the airplanes that we use now, we use the Lear 25 and aircraft of that type, but they will carry 408 cloud-sheeting flares compared to the 52 that we used to carry during the hurricane experiments in the mid-'60s.
[01:44:25.396 --> 01:44:29.803]  So that's about eight times, about eight times, 800% increase in the cloud seeding capacity.
[01:44:33.263 --> 01:44:34.004]  I'll beat your aircraft.
[01:45:03.223 --> 01:45:10.565]  Well, it is a shame because the company that I've affiliated with has been doing this kind of weather control for the Canadian government for ten years.
[01:45:35.974 --> 01:45:37.435]  Can you talk about South Korea?
[01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:40.919]  When I had you on last year, you couldn't talk about South Korea in a deal you guys might do with them.
[01:45:41.139 --> 01:45:44.443]  Well, that is still in the wind.
[01:45:45.083 --> 01:45:46.485]  That's still in the making.
[01:45:47.766 --> 01:45:55.915]  If we don't do something that takes up or makes work for our company in this project, we will probably be in South Korea this summer.
[01:45:58.121 --> 01:46:02.803]  But it takes some time and effort to prepare for a season of hurricanes.
[01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.404]  But the point is, is the secret's out.
[01:46:04.464 --> 01:46:06.164]  Now they're talking about it in the Senate a lot more.
[01:46:06.224 --> 01:46:08.565]  And the solution is get the word out and tell everybody.
[01:46:08.585 --> 01:46:13.528]  And we've got links to some of the websites you're affiliated with and the groups and the news articles and bills.
[01:46:13.548 --> 01:46:13.928]  Uh-huh.
[01:46:13.968 --> 01:46:15.048]  I thought that production was excellent.
[01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:16.549]  It gave us a chance to take our time and explore
[01:46:37.767 --> 01:46:40.048]  The ramifications of some of the statements we made.
[01:46:40.288 --> 01:46:44.971]  Well, I'm going to beef it up and have a part two that will be in a documentary that should be out in about three or four months.
[01:46:45.431 --> 01:46:48.552]  And so I'll be sure and get you a copy of that, Ben.
[01:46:48.572 --> 01:46:49.773]  Anything else you want to say in closing?
[01:46:49.813 --> 01:46:54.255]  Yeah, I would like to say in closing, and this will take a couple of minutes, of what we ought to do.
[01:46:55.176 --> 01:47:04.340]  I think the President should come out immediately and make a statement to the nation of his strong indications that hurricane damage reduction procedures work or practices work.
[01:47:05.009 --> 01:47:12.491]  Number two, he ought to announce his intentions to let the science and technology developed by corporate America demonstrate their performance in 2006.
[01:47:13.051 --> 01:47:26.174]  And number three, he ought to contract a company that's identified in a letter to him and to all the senators, contract a qualified company and their civilian scientists to do this work.
[01:47:26.934 --> 01:47:30.755]  And number four, I think they ought to take responsibility out of the
[01:47:32.333 --> 01:47:37.235]  For hurricane control out of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[01:47:38.395 --> 01:47:39.436]  And here's what it would do.
[01:47:40.556 --> 01:47:45.938]  It would fulfill the President and the Senator's Christian obligation to help others when it's possible.
[01:47:46.798 --> 01:47:51.960]  But Ben, you said it yourself that they couldn't hand out $200 billion in little goody goods to all their friends.
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:48:00.383]  Yeah, I think they might prefer that, prefer to hand out $200 billion to select people than to
[01:48:01.258 --> 01:48:05.799]  Hand out $25 or $30 million to some company that could reduce that damage by 30 or 40%.
[01:48:05.839 --> 01:48:16.082]  Now, you've done unofficial studies, and I've seen some other ones, for a paltry sum, I mean, what, $100 million a year, you could have basic total weather control over the U.S.?
[01:48:17.702 --> 01:48:19.982]  Oh, for $100 million a year, you'd have some left over.
[01:48:21.703 --> 01:48:23.963]  Ben Livingston, I want to thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:48:24.003 --> 01:48:24.463]  God bless.
[01:48:24.744 --> 01:48:25.804]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:48:26.044 --> 01:48:26.444]  Take care.
[01:48:27.276 --> 01:48:31.200]  Folks, this is demonstrated, documented, old technology.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:35.825]  And of course, look, Ben, they won't let him into the loop for a long time.
[01:48:35.885 --> 01:48:38.067]  They've got advanced weather control technologies.
[01:48:38.427 --> 01:48:46.495]  But instead of arguing that, instead of arguing that clearly they manipulated those hurricanes, and other meteorologists said it, you could see it, you could see it going on.
[01:48:46.535 --> 01:48:48.017]  They did things hurricanes have never done.
[01:48:48.749 --> 01:48:55.373]  Instead of even arguing that, I'll just go get you somebody who's the father of an old technology that works 110% of the time.
[01:48:55.853 --> 01:48:56.834]  Certified to work.
[01:48:56.934 --> 01:48:57.674]  Totally works.
[01:48:58.155 --> 01:49:00.516]  Senate, you heard us reading Senate documents last year.
[01:49:00.576 --> 01:49:01.357]  They admit it works.
[01:49:02.217 --> 01:49:03.318]  And they're not going to stop it.
[01:49:04.318 --> 01:49:06.339]  Because they don't want to keep this country safe.
[01:49:06.359 --> 01:49:08.461]  You understand, they make money off of terrorism.
[01:49:08.801 --> 01:49:10.262]  They make money off of hurricanes.
[01:49:10.282 --> 01:49:15.565]  They make money off disasters, which can centralize things, and then they decide who it goes to.
[01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:19.150]  And so that's why we had Ben Livingston back on.
[01:49:19.170 --> 01:49:21.691]  And he said a lot more this time than he said on air before.
[01:49:22.151 --> 01:49:24.072]  And if you could only hear the stuff he says off air.
[01:49:24.552 --> 01:49:28.034]  But again, I mean, the guy's, you know, had the top security clearances on a lot of things.
[01:49:28.074 --> 01:49:32.195]  He still just, even though a lot of it's declassified, he's in the habit of not talking about it.
[01:49:32.876 --> 01:49:34.656]  But just another example.
[01:49:34.676 --> 01:49:38.838]  So I'm not going to debate fancy, you know, 21st century Buck Rogers stuff.
[01:49:38.898 --> 01:49:40.179]  Yeah, it's here, it's going on.
[01:49:40.559 --> 01:49:42.920]  Let's just talk about what's patently admitted.
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:44.000]  Okay?
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:44.880]  On the record.
[01:49:45.761 --> 01:49:45.841]  And...
[01:49:46.545 --> 01:49:47.986]  They're going to let people die again next year.
[01:49:48.006 --> 01:49:50.427]  They're going to let your house get destroyed next year.
[01:49:51.067 --> 01:49:51.907]  Because they love it!
[01:49:52.087 --> 01:49:53.108]  They love it!
[01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:57.430]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.690 --> 01:49:58.390]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:59.251]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.611 --> 01:50:04.273]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.633 --> 01:50:11.356]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.636 --> 01:50:12.037]  We're good to go.
[01:50:29.855 --> 01:50:33.536]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.776 --> 01:50:36.197]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.357 --> 01:50:39.918]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:50:39.938 --> 01:50:44.240]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:51.242]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:50:53.559 --> 01:51:01.825]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:02.086 --> 01:51:06.429]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.729 --> 01:51:15.636]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.856 --> 01:51:19.459]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.

[01:52:56.312 --> 01:53:02.354]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.954 --> 01:53:05.954]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:10.235 --> 01:53:11.536]  All right, I know we've got a load of phones.
[01:53:11.556 --> 01:53:17.417]  We'll keep Dr. Breeding off until eight minutes after in the next hour so I can take some calls now and take some of that next little five-minute...
[01:53:18.041 --> 01:53:22.645]  ...segment, and talking about forced psychological testing, forced drugging.
[01:53:23.005 --> 01:53:28.549]  This is the Sovietization of America that's coming up in the next hour with a new freedom initiative moving forward.
[01:53:29.009 --> 01:53:31.291]  Right now, let's go back to Randy in Indiana.
[01:53:31.311 --> 01:53:38.697]  He wanted to talk about the brainwashing locally in his neighborhood, and how he feels like the globalists just fly over us.
[01:53:38.717 --> 01:53:47.283]  We're here in flyover country, and how they want the toll roads to lock everything down and track and trace us, and how the Carlaw Group's the biggest employer in his area, and what's happening...
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:53.043]  Alex, you hit it all right on the head, and just listening to you and the doctor reminds me of a lot, too.
[01:53:53.103 --> 01:53:59.027]  I spent many years in broadcasting, five years as a television weatherman in Arkansas.
[01:53:59.267 --> 01:54:00.188]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:54:00.208 --> 01:54:01.248]  We had you on hold from earlier.
[01:54:01.308 --> 01:54:02.069]  Yeah, I know.
[01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:13.216]  I was laughing about it because the other day when you had Tex Mars on, the guy who filmed the Freemason talk at the lodge was on the phone, too, and it's just amazing how everybody's
[01:54:13.883 --> 01:54:15.824]  Waking up and coming together a little bit.
[01:54:15.984 --> 01:54:20.346]  Yeah, we're talking about Freemasonry and how low-level ones aren't aware of what's happening.
[01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:21.467]  High-level is controlled.
[01:54:22.007 --> 01:54:25.709]  And then I start talking about the guy who'd gone in and videotaped a Freemason meeting.
[01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:26.649]  We put it on the website.
[01:54:27.129 --> 01:54:30.091]  And then, boom, I go to the first caller and it's him, yeah.
[01:54:30.591 --> 01:54:32.212]  A guy who'd called like once before.
[01:54:32.492 --> 01:54:36.374]  Yeah, well, and like me with the guy with the weather because it's just amazing.
[01:54:36.634 --> 01:54:40.435]  I'm trying to think when I saw those chemtrails I was telling you about.
[01:54:40.455 --> 01:54:43.457]  There in southern Indiana they had a tornado outbreak.
[01:54:44.610 --> 01:54:46.231]  Right there before Christmas time.
[01:54:46.991 --> 01:54:50.073]  That damaged a lot there.
[01:54:50.113 --> 01:54:55.015]  They're not going to fix the hurricanes because they're not going to admit they've got it because they are weather modding right now.
[01:54:55.616 --> 01:54:58.617]  It's pretty amazing what's going on, but just feeling like the flowers.
[01:54:58.657 --> 01:55:01.639]  I'm in southern Illinois, but I'm right next to Indiana.
[01:55:02.279 --> 01:55:12.764]  But the Cindy Sheehan thing going on with her, I know she's being used now by everybody, but what's difficult in the area I live in
[01:55:13.708 --> 01:55:16.669]  A boy from my town was killed in the same battle.
[01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:22.392]  And his mother, of course, is pro-war and we're doing the right thing and all that.
[01:55:22.452 --> 01:55:28.835]  So, see, I'm kind of stuck in this... Well, see, she can't admit to herself that it was a needless sacrifice for a bunch of crooks.
[01:55:29.375 --> 01:55:33.457]  And so a lot of mothers are going to go the other way and say, how dare you say my son died in vain.
[01:55:33.717 --> 01:55:38.639]  And I'm not taking away from that these young men think they're fighting for good and that they are good people.
[01:55:39.239 --> 01:55:39.899]  Oh, I know.
[01:55:39.979 --> 01:55:46.402]  It's just that the war is based on lies and is a fraud and is unjust, and that isn't going to change.
[01:55:46.862 --> 01:55:51.103]  It, quote, doesn't let our troops down to get them out of there.
[01:55:51.403 --> 01:55:57.786]  It's like if they've thrown five people off a cliff, well, we've got to throw another hundred off because we can't let those first five down.
[01:55:57.806 --> 01:56:04.168]  I did some simple mathematics just the other day when I saw a report a couple months ago in the newspaper.
[01:56:04.648 --> 01:56:08.230]  And I was telling the people at work about it, and they just had a hard time believing it.
[01:56:08.290 --> 01:56:10.651]  But it's like, you know, because I've been called a few names here.
[01:56:10.691 --> 01:56:12.432]  Okay, give me the numbers.
[01:56:12.552 --> 01:56:20.416]  Just reading about the soldiers that come back that are going to have something wrong with their mind, the post-traumatic stress syndrome.
[01:56:20.496 --> 01:56:29.541]  Then I factored in the number killed, the number wounded, and it was like, with the number over there, you've got like a one-in-two shot of coming back with something wrong.
[01:56:30.436 --> 01:56:40.663]  And by the way, the Pentagon, now for the last decade or more, has been sending anybody who has post-traumatic stress disorder into a database, and now they're denying veterans the right to own guns.
[01:56:40.984 --> 01:56:41.744]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:41.764 --> 01:56:51.951]  And by the way, about one in three got post-traumatic stress, or just burnout, shutdown, battle fatigue, shell shock, in Vietnam.
[01:56:52.111 --> 01:56:59.296]  Now, over half are going to get it, because in World War II in Vietnam, they only made you serve one tour 11 months.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:04.242]  Now, there are people over there going into their fourth tour now.
[01:57:04.683 --> 01:57:08.905]  Three years they've been over there, and a year in the build-up.
[01:57:09.466 --> 01:57:12.248]  There are people going into their fourth terms now.
[01:57:12.868 --> 01:57:13.588]  Fourth tours.
[01:57:14.409 --> 01:57:17.771]  And, I mean, a lot of them, it is every day they raid 20 houses.
[01:57:18.111 --> 01:57:20.253]  Imagine the SWAT team having to do 20 raids a day.
[01:57:20.293 --> 01:57:23.055]  I mean, this should burn anybody out.
[01:57:23.615 --> 01:57:26.757]  And it's always the big macho guys, I can just keep going forever.
[01:57:28.323 --> 01:57:29.183]  Because I'm one of them.
[01:57:29.423 --> 01:57:31.304]  Believe me, you can't keep going forever, folks.
[01:57:33.744 --> 01:57:38.586]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.646 --> 01:57:39.086]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.246 --> 01:57:40.046]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.246 --> 01:57:43.207]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.287 --> 01:57:48.448]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.431 --> 01:57:57.293]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.313 --> 01:58:01.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.181 --> 01:58:06.287]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.569 --> 01:58:09.893]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now in...
[01:58:12.097 --> 01:58:17.882]  To hour number three on this live Thursday edition, the 19th day of January 2006.
[01:58:18.883 --> 01:58:27.670]  And for the next hour, we're going to be joined by somebody who didn't sit there and suck their thumb and whine and roll around in a fetal position.
[01:58:29.111 --> 01:58:33.715]  No, somebody who actually got involved, engaged the New World Order at point-blank range...
[01:58:35.094 --> 01:58:36.015]  We're good to go.
[01:58:55.191 --> 01:59:00.334]  We'll go to Thomas and Alex and Mike and others that have been patiently holding toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:00.354 --> 01:59:06.678]  But this is a little bit different of a 9-11 film from some of the others I've seen, different from mine.
[01:59:07.967 --> 01:59:08.527]  It's excellent.
[01:59:08.587 --> 01:59:09.807]  It's a different perspective.
[01:59:10.107 --> 01:59:12.668]  Just asking the key questions, question after question.
[01:59:12.708 --> 01:59:13.408]  Well, what about this?
[01:59:13.448 --> 01:59:14.028]  What about that?
[01:59:14.488 --> 01:59:18.689]  And then it answers the question for you if you've got a brain.
[01:59:19.369 --> 01:59:21.850]  And so I think it's very effective, and folks should get it.
[01:59:21.890 --> 01:59:22.710]  We're very, very honored.
[01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:24.070]  Dylan is very gracious, too.
[01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:28.891]  He let us post Loose Change 1 at prisonplanet.tv, and we put a link over to him where you can get it.
[01:59:28.911 --> 01:59:34.533]  But now we're not sharing Loose Change 2, and hopefully he'll let us put that up on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:59:34.993 --> 01:59:36.293]  Dylan, thank you for joining us.
[01:59:37.091 --> 01:59:38.312]  Yeah, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:59:38.372 --> 01:59:38.993]  It's good to be on.
[01:59:39.393 --> 01:59:39.733]  You bet.
[01:59:39.773 --> 01:59:42.015]  You know, you're just another success story.
[01:59:42.075 --> 01:59:50.021]  I had David Stahl on, who's a city manager, a retired police officer, been a city councilman, and he discovered the toll road tracking grid.
[01:59:50.061 --> 01:59:56.166]  He went public, and now it looks like we may be able to beat it, at least the majority of counties are joining us to say no to it.
[01:59:56.707 --> 02:00:04.513]  And you and a couple college students got together, did the research, you went off other documented research, did your own, and have done something very effective.
[02:00:04.533 --> 02:00:05.434]  You're effecting change.
[02:00:06.541 --> 02:00:07.342]  Well, I'm doing my best.
[02:00:08.483 --> 02:00:14.587]  Tell us about yourself before we get into the film and 9-11 and what you think is most important about it and take some calls on a host of issues.
[02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:16.168]  But tell us about your awakening.
[02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:16.989]  What woke you up?
[02:00:17.049 --> 02:00:18.090]  Why did you decide to do this?
[02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:18.710]  What was it like?
[02:00:19.751 --> 02:00:22.313]  Well, it was about three years ago in May 2002.
[02:00:22.873 --> 02:00:28.777]  I was building a restaurant that was basically funded by James Gandolfini who plays Tony Soprano on the HBO series Sopranos.
[02:00:29.418 --> 02:00:31.820]  And in May 2002, he came up for the opening party.
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:34.922]  I had a chance to speak with him after the party and he was... I...
[02:00:35.703 --> 02:00:44.945]  I was thinking about getting into the whole film industry, acting, directing, figuring out what I wanted to do, and I approached him, it was like 3 in the morning, I was like, Jim, I just had a quick question.
[02:00:45.485 --> 02:00:46.905]  Is this whole acting thing worth it?
[02:00:47.586 --> 02:00:48.926]  And is it worth it?
[02:00:49.006 --> 02:00:50.806]  And he was like, well, not really, kid.
[02:00:51.206 --> 02:00:53.487]  So I was like, okay, well, how about directing?
[02:00:53.527 --> 02:00:58.788]  He's like, well, if you want to be a successful director, then you have to have something that you want to say to the world.
[02:01:02.636 --> 02:01:03.516]  That's good advice.
[02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:04.577]  You've just got to do it.
[02:01:04.677 --> 02:01:06.238]  It doesn't even have to be perfect.
[02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:08.519]  You've done a great job, though, in the first thing you did.
[02:01:08.559 --> 02:01:15.222]  But, I mean, instead of just talking and all these trendy prants around, have lots of film meetings, and that's not how you do it.
[02:01:15.242 --> 02:01:15.863]  You just do it.
[02:01:16.623 --> 02:01:20.345]  Yeah, well, like I said, man, I'm just a kid doing what I feel in my heart I need to do.
[02:01:21.306 --> 02:01:23.167]  Well, you're not a kid at 23, right?
[02:01:23.467 --> 02:01:25.488]  I mean, we had a lot of founding fathers that were that age.
[02:01:27.528 --> 02:01:27.908]  That's right.
[02:01:27.928 --> 02:01:28.449]  They were young.
[02:01:28.509 --> 02:01:28.929]  I forgot.
[02:01:28.969 --> 02:01:29.669]  You're not a kid.
[02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:34.772]  They tell us that we're kids until we're 30 now, so we never realize we're men when we're 13, 14.
[02:01:36.253 --> 02:01:38.974]  I'm still growing, so I can't say I'm a man yet, but I'm on my way.
[02:01:40.195 --> 02:01:46.418]  I say you're a man, a man who has beliefs, a man who gets involved, a man who takes action.
[02:01:46.658 --> 02:01:48.639]  You're doing a great job there, Dylan.
[02:01:48.679 --> 02:01:49.160]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:49.940]  I really appreciate it.
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:50.300]  You bet.
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:51.401]  So he told you.
[02:01:51.441 --> 02:01:52.101]  This is riveting.
[02:01:52.461 --> 02:01:55.383]  He told you just have something you believe in and get involved.
[02:01:56.016 --> 02:01:57.936]  Yeah, just have something to say and stand behind it.
[02:01:58.016 --> 02:02:15.619]  So I took a couple different ideas that I had been toying with in the past and characters and kind of threw them all together and started writing a feature film script, which eventually turned into Loose Change the Movie, which was a semi-fictional story about me and my friends finding out that September 11th was basically an inside job.
[02:02:16.319 --> 02:02:17.500]  And commercial break.
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:20.240]  That is a commercial break.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:22.621]  When we get back, we'll hear more about this.
[02:02:23.681 --> 02:02:25.201]  That's a seminal event.
[02:02:26.770 --> 02:02:28.411]  It was never even conscious with myself.
[02:02:28.451 --> 02:02:33.835]  I mean, I just was sick of all the lies and what was happening to our country 12 years ago.
[02:02:33.855 --> 02:02:35.716]  And so I just said, you know what, I'm going to get involved.
[02:02:36.637 --> 02:02:37.538]  And here we are today.
[02:02:38.438 --> 02:02:42.621]  Meanwhile, so many people never even live because they never get in the arena.
[02:02:45.572 --> 02:02:52.394]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.714 --> 02:02:54.095]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.295 --> 02:02:56.495]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.655 --> 02:02:58.736]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.016 --> 02:03:03.938]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.278 --> 02:03:08.299]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.559 --> 02:03:10.340]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.420 --> 02:03:21.066]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.207 --> 02:03:23.108]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.328 --> 02:03:27.190]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[02:03:48.334 --> 02:03:52.517]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.758 --> 02:03:55.560]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:58.141]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.322 --> 02:04:06.988]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.168 --> 02:04:08.529]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:12.892]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.192 --> 02:04:13.713]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.353 --> 02:04:51.715]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:51.935 --> 02:04:56.937]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:57.257 --> 02:05:05.180]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:12.363]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.583 --> 02:05:13.785]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:13.945 --> 02:05:17.330]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:20.074]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:05:20.274 --> 02:05:27.123]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:27.243 --> 02:05:29.687]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:05:29.847 --> 02:05:32.788]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[02:05:32.808 --> 02:05:32.848]  866-885-6625.
[02:05:32.868 --> 02:05:33.828]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:33.848 --> 02:05:37.250]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:59.130]  Some film students, college students got together and put it together.
[02:05:59.190 --> 02:05:59.830]  It's excellent.
[02:06:00.171 --> 02:06:02.191]  We're carrying it at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:02.651 --> 02:06:10.534]  September 11th was not a surprise attack on America, but rather a cold and calculated genocide by our own government.
[02:06:10.614 --> 02:06:11.355]  Question mark.
[02:06:11.895 --> 02:06:12.335]  What if?
[02:06:12.995 --> 02:06:18.758]  We were told that the Twin Towers were hit by commercial airliners and subsequently brought down by jet fuel.
[02:06:19.218 --> 02:06:21.879]  We were told that the Pentagon was hit by a Boeing 777.
[02:06:23.115 --> 02:06:26.616]  We were told that the Flight 93 crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[02:06:26.996 --> 02:06:34.578]  We were told that 19 Arabs from halfway across the globe acting under the orders from Osama Bin Laden were responsible.
[02:06:35.718 --> 02:06:43.700]  What you will see inside will prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that everything you know about 9-11 is a complete fabrication.
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:45.401]  Conspiracy theory?
[02:06:45.441 --> 02:06:47.121]  It's not a theory if you can prove it.
[02:06:48.127 --> 02:06:55.429]  And that's a Louder Than Words production, loose change, second edition, written and directed by Dylan Avery, produced by Corey Rowe.
[02:06:56.030 --> 02:07:03.552]  And, of course, there's a lot of other great folks involved in this, and we carry it, again, at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:03.712 --> 02:07:06.153]  Right now, you get yourself a hard copy of it.
[02:07:06.633 --> 02:07:08.854]  Dylan, you were talking about how, back in 2002...
[02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:24.165]  You are working at a local restaurant, building a local restaurant for the star of the Sopranos there in your town, and then you go talk to the head guy and you say, like three in the morning, hey, what do I do to get involved and break into acting?
[02:07:24.206 --> 02:07:26.567]  I'm just recapping for those who didn't hear it in the last segment.
[02:07:27.568 --> 02:07:28.669]  He goes, yeah, it's not worth it.
[02:07:28.689 --> 02:07:29.589]  You go, what about directing?
[02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:31.791]  He says, have something you believe in, stand behind it.
[02:07:32.569 --> 02:07:50.406]  And then you were already, I guess, kind of waking up to 9-11, and first it was going to be fiction, or quasi kind of docudrama, then you decided to make a doc, because obviously that's easier, and you know, not setting your sights too high for your first project, and you did a great job on Loose Change 1, now Loose Change 2, but I want to get also into 9-11.
[02:07:50.446 --> 02:07:52.468]  I mean, when did you start to wake up to 9-11?
[02:07:55.063 --> 02:08:02.468]  Well, I guess I subconsciously knew that something was wrong with the official story because in the first maybe 10, 20 pages I started touching upon it.
[02:08:03.088 --> 02:08:09.772]  And when I started to really research 9-11, I came across, I believe it was two key websites.
[02:08:09.852 --> 02:08:18.998]  It was Serendipity's World Trade Center and the so-called War on Terror, I believe, and Blake Puppy Archive, and a lot of people were posting videos.
[02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:21.221]  Yeah, it wasn't so much fiction as it was reality.
[02:08:21.321 --> 02:08:22.882]  And you basically hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[02:08:34.468 --> 02:08:42.393]  I had too much information to put into an actual feature-length film, so I split it off and basically made Loose Change the documentary.
[02:08:42.913 --> 02:08:45.335]  And people ask me all the time, where did you get the title Loose Change?
[02:08:45.555 --> 02:08:46.195]  Why Loose Change?
[02:08:46.235 --> 02:08:47.416]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:08:47.436 --> 02:08:52.139]  It's like, well, the reason the documentary is called that is because of the movie that it all started from.
[02:08:52.739 --> 02:08:55.901]  And if all goes according to plan, we'll be shooting Loose Change the movie this year.
[02:08:57.546 --> 02:09:04.849]  Well, I think the term loose change just makes you think of unanswered questions or loose things.
[02:09:05.449 --> 02:09:10.512]  Parts of things that are just wrong or parts of things that are jingling around in your pocket.
[02:09:11.392 --> 02:09:12.572]  Yeah, I think it's interesting.
[02:09:12.592 --> 02:09:14.593]  People hear loose change and they automatically think of money.
[02:09:15.794 --> 02:09:20.796]  Well, I think that's obviously what we're... So loose change in the film is going to mean something different?
[02:09:22.705 --> 02:09:23.986]  No, it's the same meaning.
[02:09:24.046 --> 02:09:25.566]  I mean, it means lose change.
[02:09:25.586 --> 02:09:28.407]  You know, this is what has to happen, and we're doing our part.
[02:09:29.867 --> 02:09:34.469]  So really it's a way of saying unanswered questions, things that are still running wild out there.
[02:09:34.489 --> 02:09:37.530]  Yeah, things that have to be done if we want to change this country.
[02:09:38.970 --> 02:09:40.131]  Well, that's certainly true.
[02:09:40.211 --> 02:09:44.712]  Now, this second edition, why don't you tell folks what it goes through and describe it for them?
[02:09:46.639 --> 02:09:58.722]  Well, basically, the main chapters of the film are, as you described earlier, the opening timeline of the movie, which replaced the whole pod slash missile thing from Loose Change 1.
[02:09:58.762 --> 02:10:02.243]  Loose Change 2nd Edition opens up with an opening timeline.
[02:10:03.063 --> 02:10:06.744]  The majority of the research I used was from Kiltown's website.
[02:10:06.764 --> 02:10:08.384]  I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with Kiltown.
[02:10:08.424 --> 02:10:11.085]  He's an amazing, amazing 9-11 researcher.
[02:10:11.105 --> 02:10:13.065]  If you haven't seen his site, you should definitely check it out.
[02:10:14.946 --> 02:10:15.066]  And
[02:10:16.519 --> 02:10:20.061]  Basically, I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought there.
[02:10:21.242 --> 02:10:22.943]  I understand, and you're also on cell phone.
[02:10:22.984 --> 02:10:28.808]  This is kind of a short notice interview, so you're kind of out on the job while doing this interview.
[02:10:29.228 --> 02:10:39.775]  We're going to take some calls coming up in a few minutes, but tell me about the team that made these two documentaries, because they're both excellent, but Loose Change 2, obviously, I think is a lot better.
[02:10:41.136 --> 02:10:45.099]  I mean, how long it took you to do it, how you did your research, what you decided to cover?
[02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:53.152]  I tried to stick to the main key points that I could prove, basically, because there's so much about 9-11.
[02:10:53.452 --> 02:10:56.993]  You cannot put everything about 9-11 into a single documentary.
[02:10:57.013 --> 02:11:04.936]  You're not going to make a 9-11 documentary that makes everybody happy, because everybody believes that this piece is important and this piece... Exactly.
[02:11:04.976 --> 02:11:10.418]  I've made three films about it, written a book, published a book, done hundreds of radio shows and thousands of interviews about it.
[02:11:11.155 --> 02:11:11.695]  Exactly.
[02:11:12.196 --> 02:11:13.036]  Why didn't you put in this?
[02:11:13.116 --> 02:11:14.497]  And why didn't you put in John O'Neill?
[02:11:14.557 --> 02:11:17.059]  It's like, I mean, I can't include everything.
[02:11:17.759 --> 02:11:30.408]  But again, there's those people who've never gotten off the bench, don't even understand what video editing software is, and they just go, why didn't you just make it like this?
[02:11:30.448 --> 02:11:32.789]  So I would just ignore that type of stuff.
[02:11:33.610 --> 02:11:34.630]  I mean, that's routine.
[02:11:34.751 --> 02:11:39.414]  Armchair quarterbacks who've never been on the field going, why didn't he make that pass?
[02:11:39.454 --> 02:11:39.854]  You know, it's...
[02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:42.109]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:51.052]  It's, I mean, I try, like I said, I try to stick to the things that were the most solid pieces of evidence, and what I did for the second edition is I tried to take the first one.
[02:11:51.092 --> 02:12:10.079]  I mean, I basically, right after releasing the first one, I knew that it was incomplete, and I knew that there were automatically things that people were not going to like, and things that I had to fix, and slowly offers began pouring in for people that wanted to help, people that wanted to, like I said, the main, the first contribution I got, which was key, which was Ryan Dinan, who did the
[02:12:10.643 --> 02:12:14.085]  ...animation of Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon, which was phenomenal.
[02:12:14.145 --> 02:12:15.466]  I mean, he did an outstanding job.
[02:12:15.506 --> 02:12:20.569]  This man's got a full-time job and a family, and still managed to bang that out for me.
[02:12:20.609 --> 02:12:22.210]  And again, he did an outstanding job.
[02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:28.014]  So it started with that, and then I started taking some points from the first loose change, like the hijackers.
[02:12:28.114 --> 02:12:31.796]  People emailed me constantly asking, well, where did you get that information on the hijackers?
[02:12:32.236 --> 02:12:34.297]  So I went a lot more in-depth into that.
[02:12:34.357 --> 02:12:36.939]  I had key quotes from each hijacker, each article...
[02:12:37.526 --> 02:12:38.026]  Yeah, basically.
[02:12:38.046 --> 02:12:38.746]  We tried to take
[02:13:06.391 --> 02:13:11.674]  The best suggestion is that we got, and we also tried to include things that I originally wanted to include in the first.
[02:13:11.694 --> 02:13:15.236]  I just didn't have the time and the resources, like Operation Northwoods.
[02:13:15.316 --> 02:13:17.517]  I mean, that originally opened up the documentary.
[02:13:17.577 --> 02:13:24.201]  I had this whole timeline, but it started going off course, and I started including things that weren't exactly relevant.
[02:13:24.261 --> 02:13:27.263]  So I figured I would just put that aside and come back to it at a later date.
[02:13:27.863 --> 02:13:29.404]  And that's what I did for the second edition.
[02:13:29.444 --> 02:13:34.186]  I start with Northwoods, and then I go to the controlled impact demonstration that NASA did in 1984.
[02:13:35.904 --> 02:13:37.387]  All the warnings that the government got.
[02:13:37.527 --> 02:13:44.802]  Basically, it's a much better lead-in to virgins to 9-11 who have no idea what they're about to get themselves into.
[02:13:45.579 --> 02:13:50.161]  Yeah, they've been beta testing and oiling this and preparing it for many years.
[02:13:50.201 --> 02:13:54.263]  When you really start looking at it, it is totally obvious who did this.
[02:13:54.283 --> 02:13:56.064]  It's massive.
[02:13:56.084 --> 02:13:57.545]  It is massive.
[02:13:57.565 --> 02:14:00.306]  People always say, hey, something this big, they'd get caught.
[02:14:00.946 --> 02:14:01.807]  People would speak out.
[02:14:01.847 --> 02:14:02.827]  They have spoken out.
[02:14:03.128 --> 02:14:06.449]  It is what I call an orgy of evidence.
[02:14:06.569 --> 02:14:08.030]  It is ridiculous.
[02:14:08.770 --> 02:14:15.619]  Well, number one, the official story is totally impossible, a complete joke, an absolute 110% fraud.
[02:14:15.779 --> 02:14:20.565]  Every part of it is demonstrably a lie and manufactured and deceptive.
[02:14:20.605 --> 02:14:21.385]  That's number one.
[02:14:21.946 --> 02:14:26.712]  And of course they had prior knowledge and all of that they tried to deny is now public knowledge and admit it.
[02:14:28.384 --> 02:14:30.006]  Then you look at who the hijackers are.
[02:14:30.046 --> 02:14:31.328]  They're clearly government agents.
[02:14:31.388 --> 02:14:32.790]  They're clearly being trained at U.S.
[02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:33.591]  military bases.
[02:14:33.851 --> 02:14:35.212]  They're clearly being protected.
[02:14:35.553 --> 02:14:37.836]  Then you look at NORAD standing down.
[02:14:37.896 --> 02:14:40.599]  You look at the public officials being warned not to fly.
[02:14:40.619 --> 02:14:42.041]  You look at the insider trading.
[02:14:42.301 --> 02:14:43.763]  You look at the bombs in the buildings.
[02:14:43.783 --> 02:14:44.704]  You look at all of it.
[02:14:45.645 --> 02:14:47.067]  It's pretty conclusive, Dylan.
[02:14:48.032 --> 02:14:48.992]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:49.392 --> 02:14:51.033]  And I got one of those the other day.
[02:14:51.053 --> 02:14:59.075]  People were like, well, you know, when you get to conspiracy theories like this, it's like there's, especially with something like 9-11, there's so many people that were involved.
[02:14:59.235 --> 02:15:00.915]  How have they not come out?
[02:15:01.855 --> 02:15:03.616]  I mean, there's a number of reasons why they wouldn't have.
[02:15:03.676 --> 02:15:07.977]  I mean, if you work for a government that killed 3,000 people, I mean, you probably fear for your own life as well.
[02:15:08.935 --> 02:15:10.756]  Well, look, a lot of them have gone public.
[02:15:10.937 --> 02:15:15.860]  I mean, again, the defense language school dean said, I trained some of the hijackers.
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:17.321]  They were here at my school.
[02:15:17.361 --> 02:15:18.161]  They're government ops.
[02:15:18.201 --> 02:15:19.082]  The government did it.
[02:15:19.122 --> 02:15:20.463]  It was in the San Jose Mercury News.
[02:15:20.703 --> 02:15:22.144]  They told him to shut up and threaten him.
[02:15:22.784 --> 02:15:24.325]  I mean, a bunch of people went public.
[02:15:24.345 --> 02:15:25.546]  How many FBI agents?
[02:15:25.566 --> 02:15:25.946]  How many?
[02:15:26.486 --> 02:15:32.690]  John O'Neill said, and he died on 9-11, he told British TV, he said they're going to stage an attack.
[02:15:33.591 --> 02:15:37.494]  He said they're going to let an attack take place as a way to invade Afghanistan.
[02:15:37.534 --> 02:15:38.114]  And what happened?
[02:15:39.177 --> 02:15:39.877]  Exactly that.
[02:15:41.878 --> 02:15:42.579]  It's amazing.
[02:15:42.699 --> 02:15:52.102]  Dylan, we're about to break, but in the minute and a half we've got, what are some of the other things you want to talk about when we get back?
[02:15:52.523 --> 02:15:54.023]  I'm really up for anything right now, Alex.
[02:15:54.063 --> 02:15:54.863]  I have to apologize.
[02:15:54.883 --> 02:16:00.426]  Today I am under an enormous amount of stress, so this interview is probably not under the best of circumstances.
[02:16:00.486 --> 02:16:01.046]  I just really have
[02:16:01.698 --> 02:16:08.148]  A lot of things that I'm waiting to do, and a lot of things are going wrong for us consecutively, so I'd like to apologize.
[02:16:08.208 --> 02:16:09.830]  I'm not in my best of moods.
[02:16:10.632 --> 02:16:13.416]  I've heard on other shows you do sound a bit frazzled on this one.
[02:16:14.017 --> 02:16:14.858]  Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
[02:16:14.898 --> 02:16:16.080]  I'm under a lot of stress lately.
[02:16:17.236 --> 02:16:18.257]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:16:18.297 --> 02:16:18.757]  Well, you know what?
[02:16:18.777 --> 02:16:20.318]  You've just got to relax and enjoy it.
[02:16:20.959 --> 02:16:23.621]  Yeah, well, I'm doing my best, man.
[02:16:23.661 --> 02:16:24.581]  Believe me, I'm trying.
[02:16:24.902 --> 02:16:27.664]  Yeah, well, you've taken a big load on yourself.
[02:16:28.324 --> 02:16:30.166]  Was I correct in saying you're 23 years old?
[02:16:30.706 --> 02:16:31.667]  I'm 22, actually.
[02:16:31.687 --> 02:16:31.667]  22?
[02:16:31.907 --> 02:16:32.347]  Yeah.
[02:16:33.248 --> 02:16:36.490]  So I guess when you first started getting involved, you were 20 or 19?
[02:16:38.178 --> 02:16:39.018]  18, actually.
[02:16:39.038 --> 02:16:39.018]  18.
[02:16:39.258 --> 02:16:42.319]  Because I just turned 22 this past November.
[02:16:42.659 --> 02:16:45.160]  Yeah, well, there are people out there who say, well, some kids made this.
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:46.300]  I don't want to hear from them.
[02:16:47.241 --> 02:16:49.361]  The old Bible verse, out of the mouths of babes.
[02:16:49.641 --> 02:16:58.984]  But more than that, you just went out and looked at all the research by all these incredible physicists and underwriters and all the experts, and you guys did a great job of compiling it.
[02:16:59.688 --> 02:17:00.689]  Yeah, and that's the other thing.
[02:17:00.769 --> 02:17:03.672]  People accuse us of stealing other people's research.
[02:17:03.692 --> 02:17:04.633]  We're not stealing it.
[02:17:05.094 --> 02:17:08.577]  I'm not claiming to do anything extraordinary.
[02:17:08.657 --> 02:17:09.878]  You even give people credit.
[02:17:09.898 --> 02:17:16.064]  That's what's nuts about some of these quote researchers is that, oh, you link to me or you use my stuff.
[02:17:16.084 --> 02:17:16.605]  How dare you?
[02:17:17.486 --> 02:17:21.250]  We're trying to stop a bunch of killers from doing more, folks.
[02:17:22.168 --> 02:17:24.290]  But, you know, you've just got to ignore those egomaniacs.
[02:17:24.330 --> 02:17:29.815]  There's not many of them out there, but a lot of them are trying to just control the movement and everything and try to limit its scope.
[02:17:29.875 --> 02:17:33.819]  I think it's great to have a wide debate, look at all the evidence, flesh it out.
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:36.061]  Dylan, stay there.
[02:17:36.141 --> 02:17:38.684]  Let's come back and take a bunch of calls on the other side.
[02:17:39.064 --> 02:17:42.668]  And, folks, if you want loose change, it's on InfoWars.com.

[02:17:58.820 --> 02:18:03.506]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:18:03.946 --> 02:18:10.668]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:18:11.068 --> 02:18:22.832]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[02:18:45.948 --> 02:18:48.431]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.112 --> 02:18:57.701]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:18:58.682 --> 02:19:03.627]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:06.511]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:19:06.911 --> 02:19:07.692]  There may be more.
[02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:15.664]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[02:19:16.345 --> 02:19:24.190]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:26.591]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:26.611 --> 02:19:26.932]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:39.073 --> 02:19:39.653]  Call now.
[02:19:39.853 --> 02:19:42.614]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[02:19:47.055 --> 02:19:48.215]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:48.635 --> 02:19:54.116]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:54.676 --> 02:19:55.176]  That's right.
[02:19:55.496 --> 02:19:57.777]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:58.337 --> 02:20:05.258]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:05.828 --> 02:20:13.517]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:13.958 --> 02:20:18.824]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:19.444 --> 02:20:22.468]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:25.231 --> 02:20:25.491]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.774 --> 02:20:52.641]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:20:52.781 --> 02:21:05.713]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:05.913 --> 02:21:07.695]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:07.875 --> 02:21:08.395]  We're good to go.
[02:21:27.068 --> 02:21:27.549]  We're good to go.
[02:21:54.448 --> 02:21:56.051]  We're good to go.
[02:21:56.171 --> 02:21:57.955]  We're good to go.
[02:22:09.544 --> 02:22:10.344]  Dylan Avery.
[02:22:10.364 --> 02:22:11.745]  I was talking to him during the break.
[02:22:11.806 --> 02:22:12.726]  It sounds like my life.
[02:22:12.766 --> 02:22:16.589]  He's dealing with DVD manufacturers not delivering stuff on time.
[02:22:17.229 --> 02:22:18.190]  Shipping stuff out.
[02:22:18.210 --> 02:22:19.051]  The nightmare of it.
[02:22:19.071 --> 02:22:20.892]  I remember doing it out of my house many years ago.
[02:22:20.912 --> 02:22:22.073]  And that's the point he's at.
[02:22:22.393 --> 02:22:25.075]  Trying to edit and make films while you're doing it.
[02:22:25.115 --> 02:22:27.137]  Trying to answer hundreds of emails and faxes.
[02:22:27.177 --> 02:22:27.917]  It's a lot of fun.
[02:22:28.298 --> 02:22:31.140]  And so I know the mode that Dylan's in.
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:32.661]  It's fun to be in the arena.
[02:22:33.341 --> 02:22:34.542]  These callers will be all over the map.
[02:22:34.562 --> 02:22:37.185]  They've been holding for eons, but it all ties back into the same stuff.
[02:22:37.205 --> 02:22:38.105]  Let's go to some calls.
[02:22:38.526 --> 02:22:39.446]  Thomas in Florida.
[02:22:39.466 --> 02:22:41.208]  You're on the air with Dylan Avery and Alex Jones.
[02:22:41.228 --> 02:22:41.748]  Welcome, sir.
[02:22:42.529 --> 02:22:43.230]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:46.072]  It's a given that we appreciate you.
[02:22:46.712 --> 02:22:47.593]  I'll make this quick.
[02:22:47.653 --> 02:22:50.115]  This is a little off the mark, what you're talking about today.
[02:22:50.155 --> 02:22:54.399]  Yesterday, I went in to get a regular physical for my insurance.
[02:22:54.819 --> 02:23:05.609]  And I'm sitting in the lobby and surrounded by books and things up on the wall talking about flu vaccine, get this vaccine, vaccine yourself.
[02:23:05.969 --> 02:23:08.051]  And I go back in the back and they take my blood.
[02:23:09.353 --> 02:23:12.797]  And I'm still sitting there with the deal in my arm where they pulled it out and the nurse leaves.
[02:23:12.857 --> 02:23:16.600]  And she comes back in and she's got this syringe full of something.
[02:23:16.941 --> 02:23:18.142]  And she goes to start putting it in my arm.
[02:23:18.162 --> 02:23:19.103]  I said, what are you doing?
[02:23:19.123 --> 02:23:20.364]  What are you putting in my arm?
[02:23:20.724 --> 02:23:27.191]  And she said, well, this is something we're going to be able to tell about your blood from now on of anything that's going on in your body.
[02:23:27.431 --> 02:23:28.452]  And I said, well, what's in it?
[02:23:28.972 --> 02:23:30.394]  And she said, well, it won't hurt you.
[02:23:30.414 --> 02:23:30.814]  It's safe.
[02:23:30.854 --> 02:23:31.395]  Trust it.
[02:23:31.435 --> 02:23:33.077]  She wouldn't even tell you what it was?
[02:23:33.097 --> 02:23:35.800]  She couldn't tell me what it was.
[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:38.823]  And then I'd say, well, you're not putting that in my arm.
[02:23:39.044 --> 02:23:43.609]  And she brings the doctor back there, and he couldn't even tell me what was in it.
[02:23:43.649 --> 02:23:45.291]  Well, sir, what were you there for?
[02:23:45.331 --> 02:23:46.532]  Was it a big city clinic?
[02:23:47.553 --> 02:23:48.714]  It was right up here in Sarasota.
[02:23:49.855 --> 02:24:02.580]  My regular physical for my insurance, which I have good health, and I'm blessed with that, and just for my standards... They were going to put some kind of trait... Folks, this is what's getting crazy, is that I get reports of this all the time.
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:12.343]  They know the general public's dumbed down, and so they're doing... Again, we've had a government 3,000-plus times declassified use chemical, biologicals, and radiologicals on the American people.
[02:24:13.095 --> 02:24:20.361]  I mean, again, Israel radiated 110,000 of their own children, killed them for $3 billion from the U.S., you know, up until the 60s.
[02:24:20.401 --> 02:24:24.183]  Just type in, Israel radiated its own children.
[02:24:24.203 --> 02:24:24.824]  It'll pop up.
[02:24:24.884 --> 02:24:26.245]  Mainstream news, Israel.
[02:24:26.685 --> 02:24:33.410]  The same governments that admittedly have done all this in the past now want us to totally trust them, and, oh, they wouldn't be behind terror.
[02:24:33.671 --> 02:24:35.112]  Dylan Avery, you want to comment on this?
[02:24:37.153 --> 02:24:40.636]  Well, actually, I was reading up on Mumia Abu-Jamal earlier, actually.
[02:24:41.209 --> 02:24:46.732]  I don't know if you know about him, but what happened to him happened back in the 1980s.
[02:24:46.932 --> 02:24:59.559]  Basically, this guy was a journalist, and he was a cab driver at night to pay his bills, and he was letting off a fare at like 2 or 3 in the morning, and he looks out his car window, and he sees his brother in the street.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:03.742]  His brother got shot, and Mumia ran out there to check on his brother, and then...
[02:25:04.255 --> 02:25:05.755]  He got jumped or something.
[02:25:05.795 --> 02:25:06.636]  He lost consciousness.
[02:25:06.676 --> 02:25:09.517]  And when he woke up, the officer and his brother were dead.
[02:25:10.017 --> 02:25:12.157]  And then Mumia got picked up by an ambulance.
[02:25:12.237 --> 02:25:14.118]  It took like a half hour to get to the hospital.
[02:25:14.658 --> 02:25:17.999]  And basically what ended up happening is he got framed for the officer's death.
[02:25:18.619 --> 02:25:20.520]  And he's been in jail since 1983.
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:23.341]  And this was back in the 1980s.
[02:25:23.401 --> 02:25:30.103]  I mean, this innocent black journalist in Philadelphia got framed for a brother and a police officer's murder.
[02:25:30.723 --> 02:25:31.663]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:25:33.203 --> 02:25:41.466]  There is so much bizarre stuff going on and happening, but I mean, all the stories of poor people going to the health department and get sterilized.
[02:25:41.526 --> 02:25:47.448]  I mean, that happened to, what, 400 and something thousand women from the 1920s until 1980s.
[02:25:47.788 --> 02:25:48.588]  We've had them on.
[02:25:49.289 --> 02:25:52.410]  And so, is this the city health department?
[02:25:52.430 --> 02:25:55.851]  Did you go into some old city hospital to have this checkup?
[02:25:55.911 --> 02:25:57.371]  Where were you when they were doing this?
[02:25:57.731 --> 02:26:01.873]  This was in a high-end, you know, this is a high-end area down here anyway.
[02:26:02.493 --> 02:26:04.234]  Okay, so this was in a private clinic.
[02:26:04.314 --> 02:26:09.137]  This was in a private clinic for expensive insurance that I have.
[02:26:09.317 --> 02:26:11.598]  And I've never made any claims, but here, it gets better.
[02:26:11.798 --> 02:26:13.339]  But you did say no to the shot.
[02:26:13.599 --> 02:26:20.983]  I said no, and when he couldn't tell me, they come back and say, well, we cannot honor your insurance unless you take this.
[02:26:21.784 --> 02:26:23.425]  And, you know, I said, well, I'm leaving then.
[02:26:23.946 --> 02:26:26.868]  And when they started opening the door, they were walking me out.
[02:26:27.468 --> 02:26:31.651]  So when I got in the lobby, I sat there and said, you see all this stuff to the people that were there?
[02:26:31.671 --> 02:26:34.013]  I said, you see all this stuff about vaccines on the wall?
[02:26:34.413 --> 02:26:36.455]  I asked the guy, the doctor was still by me.
[02:26:36.475 --> 02:26:39.337]  I said, have you told everybody how much mercury is in these vaccines?
[02:26:39.717 --> 02:26:41.619]  His face got blood red.
[02:26:41.719 --> 02:26:44.541]  He turned over there to the receptionist and said, call the police.
[02:26:45.061 --> 02:26:48.384]  You know, I told them it was a piece of crap when they were throwing me out the front door.
[02:26:48.805 --> 02:26:49.185]  Well, good.
[02:26:49.205 --> 02:26:50.747]  You don't need their trashy insurance.
[02:26:50.767 --> 02:26:52.468]  Folks, I hear about this all the time.
[02:26:52.708 --> 02:26:54.310]  Listen, local news gets on.
[02:26:54.350 --> 02:26:58.994]  It happens nationwide a month before school and says, you must take vaccines or you'll be arrested.
[02:26:59.215 --> 02:27:00.195]  There's no law!
[02:27:00.636 --> 02:27:09.064]  Listen, next summer, when you are watching it on TV, I don't care if you live in Albuquerque or in New York or Austin, and you're going to see it on every channel, it's the law, you'll be arrested.
[02:27:09.770 --> 02:27:10.931]  Call up and go, what's that law?
[02:27:10.951 --> 02:27:12.572]  And the news will go, we were just told to say this.
[02:27:12.812 --> 02:27:13.972]  There's not even a law!
[02:27:14.473 --> 02:27:17.694]  And sir, the story you're telling, I'm getting all the time.
[02:27:18.355 --> 02:27:21.777]  You just go to the doctor and we've got an injection for you.
[02:27:21.857 --> 02:27:22.457]  Well, what is that?
[02:27:23.257 --> 02:27:25.959]  You need to get out of here right now, boy.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.221]  Because the drug companies are giving them money to do this.
[02:27:29.281 --> 02:27:32.843]  I mean, it's just... Oh my gosh.
[02:27:33.043 --> 02:27:33.883]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.024 --> 02:27:36.925]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.405 --> 02:27:38.906]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:45.878 --> 02:27:54.402]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[02:27:54.622 --> 02:27:56.443]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[02:27:56.663 --> 02:27:57.843]  That's one in four adults.
[02:27:58.164 --> 02:28:01.145]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it,
[02:28:01.445 --> 02:28:01.965]  We're good to go.
[02:28:25.643 --> 02:28:25.883]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:28:46.531 --> 02:28:49.534]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:49.874 --> 02:28:58.703]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:59.023 --> 02:29:03.708]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.168 --> 02:29:10.892]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.293 --> 02:29:23.060]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.540 --> 02:29:28.002]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:28.182 --> 02:29:30.482]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:30.502 --> 02:29:32.463]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:32.483 --> 02:29:33.704]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:33.764 --> 02:29:35.224]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:35.244 --> 02:29:36.304]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:47.006 --> 02:29:49.589]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:51.912]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:52.193 --> 02:30:02.286]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:30:02.586 --> 02:30:04.929]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[02:30:05.089 --> 02:30:09.191]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[02:30:09.391 --> 02:30:15.093]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.
[02:30:15.433 --> 02:30:20.015]  Earth friendly, pure soaps for bathing, laundry and kitchen.
[02:30:20.195 --> 02:30:23.537]  Try pure soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:30:23.857 --> 02:30:28.779]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:30:29.039 --> 02:30:30.100]  We don't need no education.
[02:30:55.286 --> 02:31:08.794]  We don't need no thought control No dark sarcasm in the classroom Teacher leave them kids alone
[02:31:23.462 --> 02:31:31.386]  Folks, I have no way of verifying what that caller just told us, but I'm going to ask him to send us an email detailing it with names and everything.
[02:31:31.406 --> 02:31:32.907]  I will try to investigate it.
[02:31:34.108 --> 02:31:34.808]  But I know this.
[02:31:34.908 --> 02:31:43.013]  All over the country, again, GIs over and over again would go in and they'd go, Oh, free health care for your children.
[02:31:43.093 --> 02:31:46.155]  And our government would just put little kids in a chamber and kill them.
[02:31:46.175 --> 02:31:47.015]  Your kid's dead.
[02:31:47.856 --> 02:31:48.876]  That's Time Magazine.
[02:31:48.896 --> 02:31:50.097]  They'll just calmly report it.
[02:31:50.377 --> 02:31:52.098]  Pregnant wives go in to have babies.
[02:31:53.038 --> 02:31:59.159]  Back, you know, to the troops, and they'd give them uranium, plutonium pills, and tell them, now, if you don't feel good taking these vitamins, come right in here.
[02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:04.721]  And they'd have doctors on standby with film cameras rolling just to see how the baby died.
[02:32:05.341 --> 02:32:06.001]  Oh, don't believe me?
[02:32:06.101 --> 02:32:09.882]  I mean, I have this thing where talk show hosts, when I'm doing an interview, don't believe me?
[02:32:09.962 --> 02:32:12.282]  I'm not a betting man, but I'll go, 10 grand right now.
[02:32:12.442 --> 02:32:13.183]  Go on, 10 grand.
[02:32:13.203 --> 02:32:14.723]  10 grand, don't believe me?
[02:32:15.363 --> 02:32:17.604]  Don't believe me that Israel radiated 110,000 children?
[02:32:20.175 --> 02:32:23.218]  Most of them, of course, died within just a week or so.
[02:32:24.119 --> 02:32:24.640]  Don't believe me.
[02:32:24.680 --> 02:32:26.461]  Don't believe it's in mainstream newspapers over there.
[02:32:26.502 --> 02:32:31.146]  Just calmly announced like they're reporting on the price of petrol or something.
[02:32:32.227 --> 02:32:33.128]  I mean, it's that simple.
[02:32:34.017 --> 02:32:38.279]  I mean, you want to know why I freak out, why I'm always going wild?
[02:32:38.339 --> 02:32:42.340]  Because, I mean, I'm just a bunch of psychopathic killers running everything right in front of us.
[02:32:42.981 --> 02:32:50.984]  And I know, I mean, the black men in Tuskegee, they'd go in, they'd have syphilis, they'd let them die of it over 40, 50 years, and now the evidence shows they were giving them syphilis.
[02:32:51.024 --> 02:32:52.024]  Imagine, poor black men.
[02:32:52.444 --> 02:32:53.905]  I'm going in to see the doctor.
[02:32:54.405 --> 02:32:56.706]  You're in Alabama, and you go in, and
[02:32:57.330 --> 02:32:58.030]  Hello, doctor.
[02:32:58.050 --> 02:32:58.810]  I appreciate your help.
[02:32:58.870 --> 02:33:01.511]  And that doctor's like, yes, we'll take care of you here.
[02:33:03.371 --> 02:33:05.531]  Now you'll... I mean, it's so sick.
[02:33:05.851 --> 02:33:08.132]  And everybody just wants to be a bunch of naive idiots.
[02:33:08.312 --> 02:33:09.392]  What's wrong with us?
[02:33:09.652 --> 02:33:12.153]  I'm not a brain sheep in a pen that's going to take it.
[02:33:13.993 --> 02:33:17.433]  And, yeah, I've talked to people who go in, and they'll just really push these shots on you.
[02:33:17.453 --> 02:33:19.274]  They're putting all kinds of weird stuff in them.
[02:33:19.794 --> 02:33:21.274]  The doctors won't even ask what it is.
[02:33:21.294 --> 02:33:22.574]  They're just getting some bounty.
[02:33:23.014 --> 02:33:25.475]  And believe me, these insurance companies are the worst.
[02:33:25.655 --> 02:33:25.895]  And I...
[02:33:27.485 --> 02:33:34.970]  I mean, Dylan Avery, do you ever just get totally flipped out like I do just by how crazy everything that's admitted is?
[02:33:35.731 --> 02:33:36.991]  Yeah, all the time.
[02:33:37.011 --> 02:33:40.694]  That's why I try to take a break now and try to keep myself somewhat sane.
[02:33:40.714 --> 02:33:44.316]  I mean, it really is insane.
[02:33:44.336 --> 02:33:54.763]  I mean, when you know that, I mean, folks, they'll take our troops and put them out in the field and fly over and nerve gas them and just kill them.
[02:33:55.689 --> 02:34:00.952]  Over and over again, and it can be in the BBC, and it's just, oh, government kills you.
[02:34:00.992 --> 02:34:01.632]  Trust them, though.
[02:34:01.652 --> 02:34:03.594]  They're fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:34:03.634 --> 02:34:05.515]  Man, Iran's a real threat.
[02:34:07.436 --> 02:34:07.996]  Yeah, right.
[02:34:09.917 --> 02:34:16.761]  Alex, you need to have Corey on your show sometime, because he was in Afghanistan and Iraq, and he would have tons of things to tell you about the war.
[02:34:17.061 --> 02:34:18.882]  He's one of the guys that worked on the film.
[02:34:19.322 --> 02:34:20.303]  Yeah, tell us about Corey.
[02:34:20.883 --> 02:34:23.725]  Corey, well, he and I have been friends for...
[02:34:24.674 --> 02:34:25.555]  Basically forever.
[02:34:25.615 --> 02:34:28.517]  Not our entire lives, but we're definitely best friends.
[02:34:28.537 --> 02:34:30.178]  Soul brothers!
[02:34:30.839 --> 02:34:31.719]  Yeah, basically.
[02:34:32.820 --> 02:34:36.803]  We ran into each other when we started doing a paper route together, and we've been best friends ever since.
[02:34:37.743 --> 02:34:44.228]  Back in August 2001, Corey enlisted to the Army, and his first day of basic training was September 11, 2001.
[02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:48.111]  And within two or three months, he was in Afghanistan.
[02:34:48.715 --> 02:34:51.857]  And then when he was in Afghanistan, he emailed me.
[02:34:51.897 --> 02:34:53.498]  He was like, yeah, I'm in Afghanistan now.
[02:34:53.538 --> 02:34:54.938]  We're probably going to Iraq next.
[02:34:55.499 --> 02:34:56.279]  And that was in November 2001.
[02:34:56.719 --> 02:34:59.061]  And the troops knew they were going to Iraq.
[02:34:59.081 --> 02:34:59.741]  Well, they didn't know.
[02:34:59.761 --> 02:35:01.682]  I guess it was more like a joke among the troops.
[02:35:02.302 --> 02:35:06.245]  But basically, Corey just got out of the Army this past summer.
[02:35:06.365 --> 02:35:09.386]  Oh, yeah, I think I heard Corey on Jack Blood's show.
[02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:10.847]  Yeah, you probably have.
[02:35:10.927 --> 02:35:14.209]  And he's got out of the Army, and he's been fighting the good fight ever since.
[02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:17.971]  And didn't he work with you on the new film?
[02:35:18.928 --> 02:35:20.569]  Yeah, he's my producer and advisor.
[02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:26.955]  I'm the one that does the editing and all the work, but he stands over my shoulder, gives me advice, tells me what looks good, what doesn't.
[02:35:27.395 --> 02:35:28.516]  He does a producer's job.
[02:35:29.376 --> 02:35:33.440]  Well, that's why the New World Order's got a problem, is their troops, their military, their police.
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.902]  We are turning them to the light every day.
[02:35:35.922 --> 02:35:37.763]  They are coming over to America.
[02:35:38.143 --> 02:35:39.004]  They are coming home.
[02:35:39.044 --> 02:35:44.749]  They are coming home to decency and honor and beauty and love and just everything wholesome.
[02:35:45.558 --> 02:35:47.659]  And they are feeling so good when they do it.
[02:35:47.679 --> 02:35:50.260]  They are being empowered to be the warriors they truly are.
[02:35:51.081 --> 02:35:52.521]  And the New World Order needs to know this.
[02:35:52.561 --> 02:35:53.582]  We're not going down easy.
[02:35:53.602 --> 02:35:54.943]  We're not going down without a fight.
[02:35:55.263 --> 02:35:56.283]  We know who you are.
[02:35:56.363 --> 02:35:57.284]  We know what you've done.
[02:35:57.304 --> 02:36:01.446]  And we know what you're trying to set up will make all your previous crimes pale in significance.
[02:36:01.486 --> 02:36:03.527]  And I just want them to know you've got to fight.
[02:36:03.927 --> 02:36:06.348]  You don't control all of us and our numbers are growing.
[02:36:06.568 --> 02:36:07.789]  You want to tell them that, Dylan?
[02:36:09.094 --> 02:36:09.354]  Yep.
[02:36:09.754 --> 02:36:10.635]  That's what I'm doing, man.
[02:36:10.675 --> 02:36:11.456]  I'm doing my part.
[02:36:12.317 --> 02:36:14.098]  Are you taking them on at point-blank range?
[02:36:14.959 --> 02:36:15.180]  Yeah.
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:17.061]  Are you engaging enemy formations?
[02:36:17.582 --> 02:36:23.027]  Hey, man, if you could get me within speaking distance of any of these people, seriously, I'll get some answers out of them.
[02:36:23.928 --> 02:36:26.010]  I mean, I would love to be in a room with George Bush.
[02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:26.851]  I would love it.
[02:36:29.846 --> 02:36:30.927]  Let's take a couple more calls.
[02:36:30.987 --> 02:36:33.989]  Again, if you want to get Loose Change, it's on Infowars.com.
[02:36:34.009 --> 02:36:37.913]  Dylan graciously has authorized me to post it on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[02:36:37.933 --> 02:36:38.994]  That will be up by next week.
[02:36:39.774 --> 02:36:44.258]  And just such a wonderful film, and we're so honored to have Dylan with us.
[02:36:44.278 --> 02:36:45.699]  If you want to get a copy of it, it's 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:36:45.719 --> 02:36:48.101]  And just a testament to Dylan and his crew,
[02:36:56.434 --> 02:37:00.837]  Again, 19 years old, sees what's happening, goes and does the research, puts the film together.
[02:37:00.857 --> 02:37:05.879]  There have been other great films made by 60-year-old people, or films made by 30-year-old folks.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:07.780]  It doesn't matter.
[02:37:07.881 --> 02:37:08.861]  It's the information.
[02:37:08.941 --> 02:37:09.481]  I've looked at it.
[02:37:09.521 --> 02:37:10.782]  It's good information.
[02:37:10.822 --> 02:37:11.483]  It's important.
[02:37:11.803 --> 02:37:13.544]  It's very effective at waking people up.
[02:37:14.793 --> 02:37:16.014]  Be sure and get a hard copy of it.
[02:37:16.654 --> 02:37:17.975]  All supplies last, Dylan.
[02:37:17.995 --> 02:37:20.217]  We're starting to run out of that first shipment.
[02:37:20.997 --> 02:37:22.058]  How soon do we get some more?
[02:37:22.118 --> 02:37:24.279]  I mean, we've got some in stock right now, but not many.
[02:37:24.299 --> 02:37:26.361]  How long until you get some more in?
[02:37:27.261 --> 02:37:28.963]  Hopefully within a week or two, man.
[02:37:29.183 --> 02:37:30.524]  We're doing a lot of things right now.
[02:37:30.824 --> 02:37:32.385]  Like I told you over the break, we...
[02:37:33.315 --> 02:37:38.937]  We kind of got shot down at the last minute by our last... No, I understand, but you just got more in.
[02:37:38.997 --> 02:37:40.598]  It's good to be selling out of something.
[02:37:40.838 --> 02:37:44.340]  Let's go ahead here and go back to the calls.
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:46.280]  Mike in Oregon.
[02:37:46.380 --> 02:37:46.961]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:37:47.581 --> 02:37:47.961]  Hey, Alex.
[02:37:48.121 --> 02:37:49.982]  I just have a couple quick questions.
[02:37:50.162 --> 02:37:51.042]  First one to Dylan.
[02:37:51.082 --> 02:37:54.664]  I just wanted to know if he's found himself on the no-fly list.
[02:37:55.264 --> 02:37:57.165]  And, Alex, I know you're not, and I was wondering...
[02:37:58.117 --> 02:38:00.544]  I find it weird that you're not on the no-fly list.
[02:38:00.945 --> 02:38:01.647]  My dad is.
[02:38:02.108 --> 02:38:02.550]  Your dad is?
[02:38:02.951 --> 02:38:03.332]  Yes.
[02:38:04.355 --> 02:38:04.776]  Because...
[02:38:05.746 --> 02:38:10.448]  They do it selectively, and they know I'll scream bloody murder and make a big deal out of it.
[02:38:10.488 --> 02:38:11.629]  I mean, Ted Kennedy is.
[02:38:12.409 --> 02:38:21.593]  My dad, because his name is so common, Jones is very common, his first name is even more common, and so he started adding his middle initial.
[02:38:21.653 --> 02:38:28.676]  In his case, it really is a mistake, because there's so many people, I mean, there's got to be tens of thousands with his name just in the U.S.
[02:38:28.716 --> 02:38:32.117]  alone, and then in Western Europe and England, there's just as many.
[02:38:32.137 --> 02:38:33.738]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:38:35.099 --> 02:39:02.197]  But, and so they did advise people that if you're having trouble with a really common name, that what you do is you just add your initial, or maybe your initial's matching somebody, you take your initial out, and you get through, you know, it's like four-year-olds that can't fly because their name is the same as somebody else, and TSA goes, we know you're not him, but sorry, you can't fly, so there is some clear harassment, but at the same time, there's not harassment, like there's been Green Party people who are going to fly to
[02:39:02.697 --> 02:39:03.157]  We're good to go.
[02:39:19.858 --> 02:39:23.862]  And I always intensify the attack every time I'm attacked.
[02:39:23.902 --> 02:39:26.885]  They understand that's my instinctive mode.
[02:39:27.065 --> 02:39:28.267]  I don't run, I fight.
[02:39:28.867 --> 02:39:34.373]  You can fight or flight, or you can grovel and go into a catatonic, unnatural state.
[02:39:34.734 --> 02:39:40.280]  I don't run, unless I believe that's the right thing to do, but generally my instincts are don't.
[02:39:40.660 --> 02:39:43.063]  And I never really have, but I'm not saying I wouldn't.
[02:39:43.163 --> 02:39:46.327]  I'm not going to say that there's not a place for that.
[02:39:46.687 --> 02:39:49.750]  No one to hold them, no one to fold them, no one to walk away, no one to run.
[02:39:50.591 --> 02:39:53.254]  People ask, why am I alive?
[02:39:53.515 --> 02:39:55.417]  Because they don't want to make me a martyr, folks.
[02:39:56.329 --> 02:39:58.172]  Now, may there be a fake mugging.
[02:39:58.212 --> 02:40:02.299]  May I get killed in a drive-by, and they grab some crackhead and blame it on them.
[02:40:02.479 --> 02:40:03.040]  Could that happen?
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:04.382]  Yeah, but we're all going to die.
[02:40:04.602 --> 02:40:11.233]  You know, again, the number one cause of death is getting on the highway until you're 55, and it's heart attacks and cancer, respectively.
[02:40:11.933 --> 02:40:16.476]  But we all still get in our cars and hurdle down the road at 80 miles an hour with 18 wheelers right beside us.
[02:40:17.136 --> 02:40:28.002]  I was driving up to a car dealership to pick up my car that had some work done on it Saturday, and I saw a pickup truck all smashed with them cutting the guy out, tuned into the news later driving back, and he was dead!
[02:40:28.729 --> 02:40:30.030]  Now, Al Qaeda didn't kill him.
[02:40:30.050 --> 02:40:31.371]  George Bush didn't kill him.
[02:40:32.912 --> 02:40:34.373]  Chubacabra didn't kill him.
[02:40:35.694 --> 02:40:37.596]  Lions and tigers and bears didn't kill him.
[02:40:37.636 --> 02:40:40.157]  It was a car hurtling down I-35.
[02:40:40.198 --> 02:40:41.899]  And we all make that decision every day.
[02:40:42.099 --> 02:40:43.260]  We put our kids in the car.
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:44.240]  We drive out on the road.
[02:40:44.481 --> 02:40:46.382]  But then we're all quaking in fear of the government.
[02:40:46.722 --> 02:40:49.344]  Listen, man, life's too short to be afraid of dying.
[02:40:49.945 --> 02:40:50.825]  I am not afraid.
[02:40:51.446 --> 02:40:56.830]  And it's not even some heroic thing to just gut up and get past your fear.
[02:40:57.690 --> 02:40:58.130]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:58.370 --> 02:40:59.071]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:41:00.131 --> 02:41:01.851]  No, just wondering if Dylan's on the list.
[02:41:03.052 --> 02:41:03.632]  No, I'm not.
[02:41:03.732 --> 02:41:06.433]  As of last July, I flew up to California.
[02:41:06.453 --> 02:41:08.233]  I plan on going back in the next couple months.
[02:41:08.253 --> 02:41:11.274]  So if I get shot down at the ticket counter, I'll definitely let you know.
[02:41:12.955 --> 02:41:14.155]  And also, just a quick one, Alex.
[02:41:14.195 --> 02:41:16.276]  Do you give fellow filmmakers sort of like a...
[02:41:17.482 --> 02:41:22.967]  A blanket, I guess, approval to use your voice or image in documentaries to help get the word out?
[02:41:23.147 --> 02:41:29.172]  You know, I can't sit here on the radio and just say, oh, blanket, you can do whatever you want because my enemies will do stuff.
[02:41:30.033 --> 02:41:37.940]  But I've authorized people for non-profit educational purposes that is giving my videos away that you can do that because it's all fair use.
[02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:48.848]  But I do reserve the right to revoke people who are abusing it, so there isn't just a blanket carte blanche thing.
[02:41:48.928 --> 02:42:00.036]  But under fair use, you don't have to ask my permission if you want to use a very small portion of what I'm doing, or if you are critiquing what I'm doing, either good or bad.
[02:42:00.076 --> 02:42:01.737]  So you need to look into the law on that.
[02:42:01.777 --> 02:42:02.438]  Thank you for the call.
[02:42:03.378 --> 02:42:05.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Missouri.
[02:42:05.780 --> 02:42:06.581]  Tom, you're on the air.
[02:42:06.601 --> 02:42:06.941]  Go ahead.
[02:42:08.061 --> 02:42:09.662]  Hey, Dylan, just calling to say hi.
[02:42:09.702 --> 02:42:10.403]  How you doing, man?
[02:42:11.644 --> 02:42:12.904]  I'm trying to do my best, buddy.
[02:42:12.924 --> 02:42:13.365]  How about you?
[02:42:13.605 --> 02:42:14.425]  Oh, just fine.
[02:42:14.765 --> 02:42:16.667]  I'm really sorry to hear about that distributor.
[02:42:16.687 --> 02:42:17.827]  That was not very nice.
[02:42:19.248 --> 02:42:21.569]  Yeah, it's all right, man.
[02:42:22.410 --> 02:42:23.651]  Let's move on to some information.
[02:42:23.711 --> 02:42:25.052]  Anything you want to talk about in the New World Order?
[02:42:25.272 --> 02:42:26.152]  Concentration camps?
[02:42:26.172 --> 02:42:29.814]  You know, we had a big professor on last hour saying he doesn't know if we'll make it.
[02:42:29.854 --> 02:42:31.375]  We may go into total martial law.
[02:42:31.896 --> 02:42:33.737]  Any comments on something like that or anything?
[02:42:34.497 --> 02:42:35.638]  Actually, yeah, I disagree.
[02:42:36.457 --> 02:42:38.459]  With the pessimism.
[02:42:38.979 --> 02:42:40.681]  In all honesty, it's going to fall.
[02:42:41.761 --> 02:42:42.622]  It is going to fall.
[02:42:43.183 --> 02:42:45.865]  This Patriot Act, it's going to burn.
[02:42:46.725 --> 02:42:55.793]  It's going to go away because people have waken up now and they're realizing what they've seen in front of them is, you know, Toto, I'm not in Kansas anymore.
[02:42:56.613 --> 02:42:57.494]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:42:57.534 --> 02:43:00.156]  I think the illusion is disappearing.
[02:43:00.176 --> 02:43:03.319]  I mean, I think people are really seeing through things.
[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:05.040]  Exactly.
[02:43:05.661 --> 02:43:05.781]  And
[02:43:06.678 --> 02:43:16.505]  I predict similar things are going to happen here that happened in Great Britain a long time ago when they had similar things with supposed terrorist attacks.
[02:43:17.026 --> 02:43:27.453]  People in the government, people will go into office and then suddenly realize this legislation defeats the purpose of our form of government.
[02:43:27.814 --> 02:43:29.495]  Let's get rid of this legislation.
[02:43:29.515 --> 02:43:32.937]  It's good to talk about repealing things.
[02:43:32.998 --> 02:43:33.978]  I appreciate the call.
[02:43:34.098 --> 02:43:35.639]  Matt in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:36.140]  Go ahead.
[02:43:37.006 --> 02:43:38.828]  Yes, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:43:39.148 --> 02:43:40.950]  I just want to thank you all for all that you do.
[02:43:40.970 --> 02:43:44.935]  I had a comment about the title, Loose Change.
[02:43:45.876 --> 02:43:46.296]  Yes.
[02:43:47.297 --> 02:43:48.679]  What I first thought it was about...
[02:43:49.426 --> 02:43:54.807]  I thought it might be about the gold that was missing out of the bottom of the World Trade Center in the economic... That's right.
[02:43:55.127 --> 02:43:56.868]  A hundred and something billion.
[02:43:56.948 --> 02:43:57.968]  Admittedly there.
[02:43:58.048 --> 02:43:59.648]  Gold doesn't disappear, folks.
[02:44:00.468 --> 02:44:03.629]  And then there's just no discussion about it now.
[02:44:03.969 --> 02:44:07.750]  You ask the media, they go, we're not going to talk about those Federal Reserve vaults.
[02:44:07.810 --> 02:44:08.110]  Dylan?
[02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:12.151]  Yeah, we actually covered that in the conclusion of the second edition.
[02:44:12.191 --> 02:44:18.392]  Go over the gold that was missing in the empty dump trucks and the convoy of cars that was found underneath World Trade Center for...
[02:44:19.311 --> 02:44:23.236]  No bodies recovered, which means basically these people got out of their trucks and started running.
[02:44:23.783 --> 02:44:25.864]  I mean, how did they know the South Tower was going to collapse?
[02:44:26.084 --> 02:44:34.728]  Do you remember Die Hard 3, where the Germans carry out a terror attack, but really it's a diversion to rob the World Trade Center vaults?
[02:44:35.368 --> 02:44:37.849]  Globalists just love doing stuff like this.
[02:44:38.909 --> 02:44:39.449]  They love it.
[02:44:40.290 --> 02:44:51.054]  They have a Fox TV special, Lone Gunman, where a government group hijacks a jet to fly it by remote control and blame it on hijackers into the World Trade Center so they can attack Afghanistan.
[02:44:51.274 --> 02:44:52.675]  Then I have Dean Haglund on...
[02:44:53.215 --> 02:44:57.456]  From the start of the show, saying that the CIA was planning those stories on them.
[02:44:58.636 --> 02:45:00.137]  I mean, how much more obvious is that?
[02:45:01.337 --> 02:45:02.977]  It doesn't get much more obvious than that, man.
[02:45:04.478 --> 02:45:07.158]  No, it doesn't get much more obvious than that.
[02:45:07.198 --> 02:45:09.279]  Go ahead and finish up what you were saying there, Matt.
[02:45:10.219 --> 02:45:20.281]  Well, I'd like to add that I was just talking to my rep at Midas yesterday, and he informed me that the M3 money supply figures are going to be discontinued
[02:45:21.147 --> 02:45:25.692]  In March, and that's what I think makes the gold so pertinent.
[02:45:25.972 --> 02:45:26.593]  That's right.
[02:45:27.294 --> 02:45:34.441]  If you thought that Alan Greenspan printed money and drove down the value of the dollar by roughly 45%, get ready for this new guy.
[02:45:34.461 --> 02:45:36.143]  He is called Mr. Helicopter.
[02:45:36.163 --> 02:45:39.126]  He said he wants to just literally dump money out of helicopters.
[02:45:39.146 --> 02:45:39.947]  Helicopter ban.
[02:45:40.487 --> 02:45:43.671]  Yeah, sounds good until you realize that it'll be worth toilet paper.
[02:45:44.289 --> 02:45:46.070]  Right, and that's how they're really getting us.
[02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:50.252]  That's my personal interest, is what they're doing to us economically, Alex.
[02:45:50.272 --> 02:45:53.934]  But I'll tell you what, you guys just keep up what you're doing, and I'm going to keep listening.
[02:45:53.954 --> 02:45:54.534]  Thanks a lot.
[02:45:55.274 --> 02:45:55.695]  I hear you.
[02:45:55.715 --> 02:45:56.455]  I appreciate it.
[02:45:56.855 --> 02:45:59.677]  Listen, folks, we have the strongest currency in the world.
[02:46:00.697 --> 02:46:05.599]  It is now barely first world status, about to drop into major third world status.
[02:46:05.639 --> 02:46:07.380]  I mean, you know, we all joke about Mexico.
[02:46:07.961 --> 02:46:10.622]  You can go down there with a hundred bucks and live for a week.
[02:46:11.382 --> 02:46:12.883]  They've got a junk currency.
[02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:14.191]  We're good to go.
[02:46:14.211 --> 02:46:14.351]  I think?
[02:46:30.322 --> 02:46:34.184]  Yep, I'm definitely going to turn my money into gold as soon as possible, without a doubt.
[02:46:53.078 --> 02:46:58.342]  Well, I mean, obviously, folks, this network's owned by a company that sells gold.
[02:46:58.942 --> 02:47:01.604]  But, I mean, that's where I bought my gold.
[02:47:01.644 --> 02:47:03.325]  I bought some of this from Midas Resources.
[02:47:03.365 --> 02:47:05.067]  I guess about five, six different buys.
[02:47:05.087 --> 02:47:06.227]  I'm hoarding that over the years.
[02:47:06.287 --> 02:47:07.528]  A few coins here, a few coins there.
[02:47:07.568 --> 02:47:11.291]  But, you know, regardless, I don't have to sit there and stand on trust me.
[02:47:12.152 --> 02:47:17.696]  Gold has doubled in value in the last five years, and the stock market has gone down.
[02:47:18.496 --> 02:47:19.897]  And then people go, well, it's at $11,000, Alex.
[02:47:21.993 --> 02:47:24.235]  They take out any losers from it.
[02:47:24.756 --> 02:47:26.137]  You see, everything is cooked.
[02:47:26.697 --> 02:47:27.618]  Everything is cooked.
[02:47:27.698 --> 02:47:28.679]  The numbers are cooked.
[02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:30.941]  So I don't know.
[02:47:30.981 --> 02:47:31.881]  Don't listen to me.
[02:47:31.961 --> 02:47:33.483]  Double your money or don't.
[02:47:33.523 --> 02:47:35.524]  See, I didn't dump my gold when it doubled.
[02:47:35.804 --> 02:47:36.605]  I'm holding on to it.
[02:47:36.945 --> 02:47:39.127]  Because at least it's got some intrinsic value.
[02:47:39.167 --> 02:47:39.988]  It is not paper.
[02:47:45.552 --> 02:47:46.293]  Any more callers?
[02:47:46.818 --> 02:47:50.040]  We're going to go to some after this quick break, Dylan.
[02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:58.384]  We're going to go to break here, and then we're going to come back and start taking a few more final phone calls here in the final segment.
[02:47:58.444 --> 02:48:07.328]  But just so I can understand this, you are now going to try to make what a feature film out of what really happened on 9-11?
[02:48:08.249 --> 02:48:09.289]  Yeah, we're going to do our best.
[02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:14.692]  I mean, we have limited resources, but hopefully if everything goes right this year, we'll have...
[02:48:15.504 --> 02:48:17.505]  Enough within our hands to film the movie.
[02:48:18.005 --> 02:48:20.206]  Well, it'd be great to have Mel Gibson make that movie.
[02:48:22.066 --> 02:48:24.167]  Actually, you should get me in touch with Robert Rodriguez.
[02:48:25.887 --> 02:48:29.468]  Yeah, I don't know if Robert Rodriguez would want to do something like that.
[02:48:30.549 --> 02:48:31.489]  Yeah, probably not.
[02:48:31.869 --> 02:48:32.269]  Who knows?
[02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:33.370]  He might.
[02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:35.590]  I know Richard Linkletter pretty good.
[02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:36.911]  I don't really know Robert very well.
[02:48:37.431 --> 02:48:39.812]  But we'll be right back with Dylan Avery.
[02:48:39.832 --> 02:48:40.272]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.873 --> 02:48:49.734]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.974 --> 02:48:50.674]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:50.774 --> 02:48:51.554]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.894 --> 02:48:56.575]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.915 --> 02:49:03.637]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.977 --> 02:49:05.958]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.159 --> 02:49:09.001]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.101 --> 02:49:13.764]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.964 --> 02:49:18.387]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.607 --> 02:49:25.852]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.092 --> 02:49:28.514]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:51:49.789 --> 02:51:51.350]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.850 --> 02:51:59.213]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.273 --> 02:52:02.274]  Very, very busy out there fighting the New World Order.
[02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:03.980]  And that's good.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:05.421]  Talk to Ruben and Dave.
[02:52:05.461 --> 02:52:06.522]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:52:06.542 --> 02:52:07.742]  This has been a great broadcast today.
[02:52:07.762 --> 02:52:09.523]  I want to thank all of our guests that came on.
[02:52:09.543 --> 02:52:18.187]  If you missed the interview in the last hour with a professor from Notre Dame, Notre Dame University, who debated this John Yoo about how the government says they can torture children in front of their parents.
[02:52:18.227 --> 02:52:19.568]  I mean, this is getting sick.
[02:52:19.608 --> 02:52:21.288]  If you missed that, it's coming back up tonight.
[02:52:21.308 --> 02:52:22.449]  You want to tune in for that.
[02:52:23.449 --> 02:52:24.670]  Ruben in Ohio.
[02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:25.250]  You're on the air.
[02:52:25.310 --> 02:52:25.891]  Go ahead, Ruben.
[02:52:26.271 --> 02:52:27.291]  Hey, thanks.
[02:52:27.611 --> 02:52:32.874]  My favorite part of Loose Chains is where you show the jet turbine blowing a
[02:52:33.387 --> 02:52:46.057]  I think it's an ambulance or a car away from it as it approaches on a runway, proving that a 747 couldn't have flown over that highway without tumbling cars over hitting the Pentagon.
[02:52:47.338 --> 02:52:58.347]  Yeah, the reason I removed that clip from the second edition of Loose Change is because there was some speculation that that video was actually a computer simulation or something that was staged and not actually real.
[02:52:58.667 --> 02:52:59.148]  Was it real?
[02:53:00.576 --> 02:53:00.936]  I don't know.
[02:53:00.976 --> 02:53:02.237]  I heard a couple different claims.
[02:53:02.257 --> 02:53:03.118]  Some people said it was real.
[02:53:03.138 --> 02:53:05.860]  Some people said... I couldn't really get much of a verifiable source.
[02:53:06.401 --> 02:53:11.645]  Regardless, the Pentagon stinks from every different angle, and I think it's important to look at it in the film.
[02:53:12.066 --> 02:53:12.987]  The film does that.
[02:53:13.027 --> 02:53:13.807]  Anything else, Ruben?
[02:53:14.368 --> 02:53:19.573]  There's a guy on TV pushing this book, Kevin Trudeau, National Cures They Don't Want You to Know About.
[02:53:19.593 --> 02:53:21.154]  And I was watching last night, and I'm thinking...
[02:53:21.656 --> 02:53:27.641]  Why doesn't Alex Jones or Dylan Avery push their 9-11 videos on an infomercial?
[02:53:27.701 --> 02:53:28.381]  Is that possible?
[02:53:28.401 --> 02:53:31.123]  You know, I don't think that at this point it's a great idea.
[02:53:31.203 --> 02:53:32.084]  People should do it.
[02:53:32.124 --> 02:53:33.765]  If somebody else does it, more power to them.
[02:53:33.805 --> 02:53:34.926]  My goal is to get the word out.
[02:53:35.827 --> 02:53:37.108]  They can refuse.
[02:53:37.128 --> 02:53:39.209]  I know a few have actually tried similar things.
[02:53:39.229 --> 02:53:41.131]  They can refuse to let you buy time on them.
[02:53:42.475 --> 02:53:43.536]  Trudeau's even had trouble.
[02:53:43.556 --> 02:53:44.737]  His stuff's pretty mild.
[02:53:45.357 --> 02:53:51.903]  And it takes a lot of capital to even produce those at the standards they demand and then to distribute it and do it.
[02:53:51.943 --> 02:53:53.545]  It is a monumental undertaking.
[02:53:53.605 --> 02:53:54.565]  It should be attempted.
[02:53:54.585 --> 02:53:55.486]  It should be tried.
[02:53:56.427 --> 02:53:59.470]  But again, we need to be capitalized and supported to do that.
[02:54:00.257 --> 02:54:03.060]  According to some, I'm bad that I say make copies of my videos.
[02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:04.141]  I shouldn't even sell them.
[02:54:04.461 --> 02:54:07.164]  The problem is we couldn't even make films if we didn't sell films.
[02:54:07.184 --> 02:54:11.067]  But that's the COINTELPRO people that don't want us to even be able to fight the New World Order.
[02:54:11.107 --> 02:54:12.108]  Thank you, Ruben, for the call.
[02:54:12.569 --> 02:54:13.470]  Dave in Connecticut.
[02:54:13.490 --> 02:54:15.371]  That's a great idea from Ruben, isn't it?
[02:54:16.032 --> 02:54:17.013]  That's a great idea, Dylan.
[02:54:17.651 --> 02:54:18.512]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:54:18.872 --> 02:54:20.313]  Let's talk to Dave in Connecticut.
[02:54:20.333 --> 02:54:21.113]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:54:21.153 --> 02:54:21.594]  Go ahead.
[02:54:21.834 --> 02:54:22.314]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:22.354 --> 02:54:22.834]  How are you?
[02:54:23.014 --> 02:54:23.215]  Good.
[02:54:23.235 --> 02:54:25.816]  Listen, I'm worried about the economics of the situation.
[02:54:25.836 --> 02:54:30.459]  I agree that the Patriot Act might get turned down, but I'll give you an example.
[02:54:30.539 --> 02:54:32.601]  Regional news up here in the Connecticut area.
[02:54:33.041 --> 02:54:37.804]  An iconic company, something you're going to be very familiar with, Winchester Repeating Arms.
[02:54:38.206 --> 02:54:40.327]  They're going to be closing the plant in 60 days.
[02:54:41.108 --> 02:54:41.788]  60 days, Alex.
[02:54:41.868 --> 02:54:43.049]  Winchester repeating arms.
[02:54:43.369 --> 02:54:46.811]  The gun that won the West, and you want to know what they're thinking of reopening the plant?
[02:54:47.232 --> 02:54:49.553]  I thought Winchester was already in Japan.
[02:54:50.093 --> 02:55:00.240]  Well, there's a New Haven plant here, and they're making stuff, and they're going to be closing it, and it's going to be going, the rest of the operation, if they've got some of it there, is going to be going to China.
[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:05.062]  Yeah, I knew Japan actually had manufacturing plants in China.
[02:55:05.102 --> 02:55:06.683]  I thought it was a Japanese operation.
[02:55:06.863 --> 02:55:12.926]  Well, according to what I'm hearing from the mayor of New Haven on the local news, which, of course, you take what you take, he's trying to stop it.
[02:55:13.066 --> 02:55:15.447]  But I'll give you another quick example.
[02:55:15.547 --> 02:55:19.829]  I worked for the world's largest oil company, won't mention their name, for five years.
[02:55:19.929 --> 02:55:20.609]  ExxonMobil.
[02:55:20.789 --> 02:55:21.029]  Right.
[02:55:21.069 --> 02:55:22.750]  They closed the plant in Connecticut.
[02:55:22.850 --> 02:55:26.732]  It was a plastics manufacturing facility because the price of resin went up.
[02:55:27.205 --> 02:55:28.667]  One they helped raise, by the way.
[02:55:28.988 --> 02:55:30.390]  Said it wasn't making any money.
[02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:41.004]  And then I went to... 60 days later, I got another job at a rolling mill company in the Connecticut area that had been open since 1905.
[02:55:41.064 --> 02:55:43.788]  I was there for 45 days, and they announced...
[02:55:44.221 --> 02:55:45.342]  They're closing the plant.
[02:55:45.442 --> 02:55:46.563]  Hey, that's a great economy.
[02:55:46.583 --> 02:55:47.423]  The economy's great.
[02:55:47.463 --> 02:55:49.065]  It's a liberal lie that it isn't.
[02:55:49.605 --> 02:55:50.586]  Thank you for the call, Dave.
[02:55:50.606 --> 02:55:51.126]  Great points.
[02:55:51.226 --> 02:55:53.748]  Dylan Avery, again, I'm just so glad you stood up to the plate.
[02:55:54.429 --> 02:55:55.089]  Made a great film.
[02:55:55.129 --> 02:55:57.591]  Your second edition is even better.
[02:55:57.631 --> 02:55:59.212]  We'll carry it at Infowars.com.
[02:55:59.532 --> 02:56:01.394]  Thank you so much for defending this country.
[02:56:02.174 --> 02:56:03.495]  Yeah, thanks for having me on your show, Alex.
[02:56:03.515 --> 02:56:05.797]  I've been looking forward to it.
[02:56:05.857 --> 02:56:06.418]  You bet.
[02:56:06.538 --> 02:56:10.080]  And we look forward to having you back on again in the future.
[02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:10.781]  So God bless you.
[02:56:11.408 --> 02:56:12.369]  Yeah, you too, Alex.
[02:56:12.409 --> 02:56:13.050]  Take care of yourself.
[02:56:13.230 --> 02:56:13.490]  You bet.
[02:56:13.530 --> 02:56:13.830]  Bye-bye.
[02:56:14.351 --> 02:56:14.971]  All right, folks.
[02:56:14.991 --> 02:56:16.372]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:16.392 --> 02:56:18.775]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central Standard Time.
[02:56:18.795 --> 02:56:21.257]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:21.437 --> 02:56:24.019]  God bless you all.
