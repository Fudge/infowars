[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:01.770]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.470]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.370]  Defending our borders.
[00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:03.971]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:07.552]  Fighting the American community.
[00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:09.173]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:09.193 --> 00:00:11.094]  This is explosive talk radio.
[00:00:11.114 --> 00:00:12.614]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.151]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:34.832]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:39.893]  That's right, it is Sunday, November 11, 2006, and we're going to be live here.
[00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:57.970]  For the next two hours.
[00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.094]  It's actually November 12, 2006 on this Sunday.
[00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:12.359]  I'm here looking at a poll that I guess closed up yesterday here, which does say the 11th.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.722]  And it says, Do you believe President Bush's actions justify impeachment?
[00:01:18.523 --> 00:01:19.484]  There were 375,488 respondents.
[00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:24.938]  We're good to go.
[00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:25.278]  I think?
[00:01:55.644 --> 00:02:00.725]  And I am so angry over what she's doing that I'm almost speechless.
[00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:04.186]  I notice that the phones are already starting to load up here.
[00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:19.590]  I would hope that listeners today would talk about the election, talk about what the Democratic Party's doing, discuss the fact that they claim that they want to start some orderly pullout of Iraq, but that's only to pacify their constituents.
[00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.851]  I would hope that the listeners of this broadcast would call in
[00:02:25.474 --> 00:02:30.035]  On the subject of the fact that we have a single party system
[00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:31.178]  In this country.
[00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:32.398]  Or maybe you disagree.
[00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:36.819]  Maybe you think there's really a difference between the Republicans and the Democrats.
[00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.480]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-590-5525.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.020]  That's 877-590-KLBJ.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.201]  We are coming to you from the studios of NewsRadio 590 KLBJ and have quite a few new affiliates turning us on.
[00:02:50.422 --> 00:02:53.162]  We also have a huge audience, obviously, via the Internet.
[00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:57.823]  You can listen to the KLBJ website, 590KLBJ.com, as well as InfoWars.com.
[00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:01.486]  We'll be going to your calls in the next segment.
[00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:03.488]  I'm going to take a lot of calls in the next two hours.
[00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:07.352]  I want to give you a chance to chime in on what's happening, but let me just go ahead and jump into it.
[00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:22.747]  If there was any doubt about the fact that the Democrats were just as pro-world government and pro-North American Union and amnesty and open borders and NAFTA trans-corridor highways...
[00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:24.044]  Here it is.
[00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:25.944]  Day one, they get elected.
[00:03:26.024 --> 00:03:33.026]  By Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi was saying, impeachment's off the table, no discussions, no investigations.
[00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:36.086]  And people said, oh, don't worry, Howard Dean.
[00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:43.248]  I started criticizing Nancy Pelosi and these little liberals, well-meaning people, but they're pretty ignorant about the facts of life.
[00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:49.609]  Started calling in going, oh, don't worry, Howard Dean, the chairman of the DNC, he'll get Bush, he'll demand it.
[00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:50.449]  He came out.
[00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:52.796]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:53.596]  I think we're good to go.
[00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:34.023]  When Montana and Virginia were still in play, and several other House seats were in play, but two Senate seats, they were already out front having meetings with Bush via telephone, and I'm sure there were backroom deals made beforehand that if the Democrats win, we're all going to cover each other's backsides.
[00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:35.524]  And why is this happening?
[00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:45.490]  Because, well, there's many reasons, but one of the big ones is when George Bush got elected and got sworn in on January 23rd,
[00:04:48.408 --> 00:05:10.130]  2001, the first thing he did on the 24th, his first full day in office, was to threaten Congressman Dan Burton's committee and tell a good Republican congressman, he actually is a conservative, to drop any House investigation of Bill Clinton pardoning convicted cocaine dealers.
[00:05:10.797 --> 00:05:19.981]  Bill Clinton pardoning just all sorts of different criminals and people that had made campaign contributions, totally illegal, violated a bunch of laws.
[00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:24.783]  And it was a real move to indict Bill Clinton, to go after Bill Clinton.
[00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:28.177]  Also for lying to Congress, and that got shot down.
[00:05:28.617 --> 00:05:29.598]  Why did it get shot down?
[00:05:29.638 --> 00:05:31.378]  Because you have a one-party system.
[00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:36.320]  Oh, they'll fight with each other over who gets to ride shotgun, basically, with the New World Order.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.542]  They'll fight with each other over who gets to have the most power.
[00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:46.044]  But it's two different management teams bidding for the CEO job of Slavery Incorporated.
[00:05:46.084 --> 00:05:49.726]  And if you've heard that before, I say that in the film Waking Life, directed by Richard Linklater.
[00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.563]  I've had people before, when I say that, email me and go, you're plagiarizing a movie!
[00:05:54.084 --> 00:05:55.405]  That's me!
[00:05:55.565 --> 00:05:57.247]  I'm the guy in that movie saying that!
[00:05:57.768 --> 00:06:00.711]  Alright, I don't normally drop names and things.
[00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:01.292]  I just did it.
[00:06:02.954 --> 00:06:06.218]  I like to be original here, and so if I'm repeating something, I like to tell you where it comes from.
[00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:09.001]  And so that's happening, and...
[00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:17.316]  I tell you, I've been a little bit mad at Rush Limbaugh over the last few years because he has drifted away, in my opinion, from real conservatism.
[00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:29.641]  And I was happy to hear him Wednesday say, in fact, I have the quotes here, that he feels liberated, the weight is off of him, he's been carrying water for the Republicans, and I have the quotes covered up for them.
[00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:31.542]  Well, Rush, you really didn't cover up.
[00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:34.744]  I mean, we know that they're not conservative.
[00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:35.024]  I mean...
[00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:44.830]  We don't need you to finally mea culpa and tell your audience that George Bush is the complete opposite of a conservative.
[00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.051]  But regardless, at least he said it.
[00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:49.132]  That shows a major shift.
[00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:56.236]  Again, I'm frustrated here because it's the same story every week.
[00:06:56.317 --> 00:06:57.597]  There's just too much news to cover here.
[00:06:57.997 --> 00:06:59.798]  What else has Nancy Pelosi done?
[00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:08.821]  She has said that any discussion of China's human rights abuses, any investigations, that's all off the table now.
[00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:12.163]  So all of her campaign promises have now been flushed down the toilet.
[00:07:13.383 --> 00:07:15.804]  But the really bad thing that makes me the maddest
[00:07:16.617 --> 00:07:39.287]  Is that Bush actually in a press conference on Thursday said he's happy in a way that the Democrats won because there were real conservatives in the House who would not pass the guest worker program, which if you actually read the bill is the Conyers-Kennedy bill, and in it it says total legalization of anyone who's here.
[00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:44.309]  It allows the corporations to bring in unlimited levels of skilled and unskilled workers
[00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:47.305]  I mean, this is a complete capitulation.
[00:07:47.365 --> 00:08:01.089]  It gives them guest worker ID cards that if you actually read at the SPP.gov website, government websites, they will tell you that's the new North American ID card, and that's what our driver's licenses already are now under federal law.
[00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:09.731]  It's just a unit of that North American card telling the federal government which subsector of the North American Union and which state
[00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:14.674]  Which unit of that union you come from.
[00:08:14.734 --> 00:08:17.156]  This is all official now.
[00:08:17.716 --> 00:08:34.908]  And so the Republicans, in name only, the RINOs, the neocons, are actually going to get a second wind now and be able to ram through legislation they couldn't get passed by the Republican House, where there was still some independence.
[00:08:35.528 --> 00:08:39.451]  And so now you're going to see, barring a miracle, because most conservatives...
[00:08:39.992 --> 00:08:41.093]  Still believe Bush.
[00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:46.136]  They still believe that open borders and unlimited illegal aliens are, I guess, conservative.
[00:08:46.536 --> 00:08:47.436]  I'm being sarcastic now.
[00:08:47.777 --> 00:09:05.667]  The point is we're in a lot of trouble, and this has actually deadened and been a steam valve to dissipate a lot of angst and anger, populist anger that cut across the entire political spectrum and really shattered the false paradigm of left-right.
[00:09:06.187 --> 00:09:07.468]  And it frustrates me.
[00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:08.556]  We're good to go.
[00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:08.936]  I think?
[00:09:29.913 --> 00:09:33.937]  Hundreds of millions of dollars a year federally just in lobbying.
[00:09:34.197 --> 00:09:35.598]  And who do those lobbyists work for?
[00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:36.859]  Foreign corporations.
[00:09:36.939 --> 00:09:38.281]  There's your global government right there.
[00:09:39.081 --> 00:09:39.662]  In your face.
[00:09:39.902 --> 00:09:46.748]  They've come in, they've lobbied to get rid of our borders, to get rid of our country, and we're busy arranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[00:09:47.049 --> 00:09:48.490]  Oh, Pelosi versus Bush.
[00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.191]  Of course there'll be no impeachment.
[00:09:50.612 --> 00:09:52.474]  They're on a team against the people.
[00:09:53.074 --> 00:09:54.315]  They're working against us.
[00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:55.056]  We'll be right back.

[00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:11.999]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:14.941]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:11:14.981 --> 00:11:16.102]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:22.045]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:30.231]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:40.352]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.

[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:17.024]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:24.789]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:28.091]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:30.812]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:13:31.233 --> 00:13:32.073]  NSA spies.

[00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:36.961]  Thanks for joining us again.
[00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:40.948]  Let me just recap the main focus of the broadcast today.
[00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:49.362]  The Democrats had hoped that Nancy Pelosi would come to power and call for an impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors
[00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:52.164]  George Bush, our would-be emperor.
[00:14:52.624 --> 00:15:05.769]  Now, George Bush is a puppet of the multinational corporations, of the globalists, of the worldwide crime syndicate, and he's done a great job trying to bust down our borders, destroy our sovereignty, run up giant debts for the private banks that control the Federal Reserve.
[00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:14.792]  But this is another great educational... I mean, this is a great way to educate the people.
[00:15:14.852 --> 00:15:19.794]  It's an educational opportunity to show that both parties are bought and paid for.
[00:15:21.107 --> 00:15:28.449]  All Nancy Pelosi's talking about doing is raising the minimum wage and, quote, opening up our borders, getting rid of our sovereignty.
[00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:32.510]  And George Bush is saying that on both those issues, he'll probably go along with her.
[00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.411]  Now, the issue of the minimum wage, that's a red herring.
[00:15:38.892 --> 00:15:40.572]  I mean, I've been all over the country.
[00:15:41.332 --> 00:15:44.513]  About the only people that do get paid minimum wage or lower are illegal aliens.
[00:15:44.573 --> 00:15:48.654]  I mean, people at McDonald's are starting at, you know, seven, eight, nine bucks an hour.
[00:15:49.628 --> 00:15:49.948]  We're good to go.
[00:15:49.968 --> 00:15:50.148]  I think?
[00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:27.095]  97% against the major toll roads to fund the North American Union, going in right now all over the country, especially here in Texas.
[00:16:27.115 --> 00:16:29.237]  70-plus percent of Americans against the war.
[00:16:29.317 --> 00:16:30.297]  They want out now.
[00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:32.979]  They know we were lied to about WMDs.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.901]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:16:34.981 --> 00:16:36.922]  The elite are together.
[00:16:37.203 --> 00:16:39.584]  The congressmen and women are together.
[00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:47.030]  They know who their masters are, and that's the lobbyists that work for the multinational corporations that fund their campaigns.
[00:16:47.352 --> 00:16:47.892]  Period.
[00:16:49.274 --> 00:16:51.635]  Then the people demand some type of reform.
[00:16:51.675 --> 00:17:00.102]  They come in with campaign finance reform that restricts free speech and actually doubles the amount of money that corporations can give while restricting what individuals can.
[00:17:00.502 --> 00:17:06.527]  And then they bill it as some type of reform that's positive for the people.
[00:17:07.167 --> 00:17:08.909]  And George Bush should be impeached.
[00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:15.554]  But the people that control George Bush, the people that lobbied him, the people that wrote the legislation, the lobbyists write most legislation,
[00:17:16.124 --> 00:17:17.345]  They're the real traitors.
[00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:19.407]  They're the people that should be arrested.
[00:17:19.647 --> 00:17:21.289]  The David Rockefellers of the world.
[00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:23.211]  The Lord Rothschilds of the world.
[00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:30.657]  Or George Bush's daddy, George Herbert Walker Bush and James Baker, who've really been running the administration all along.
[00:17:30.957 --> 00:17:33.560]  Now Time Magazine is saying, oh, they're really running things now.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.421]  No, they let the neocons run with it, just like Birdcage Liner.
[00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:44.443]  And as soon as it got soiled, as soon as George Bush absorbed all the hatred for carrying out the New World Order agenda, they just start.
[00:17:44.583 --> 00:17:45.863]  They pull out Rumsfeld.
[00:17:46.103 --> 00:17:48.344]  The Germans move to indict him for war crimes.
[00:17:48.364 --> 00:17:49.765]  That's coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:51.845]  And we're all told to go back to sleep.
[00:17:52.285 --> 00:17:54.146]  Oh, why, Nancy Pelosi's going to save us.
[00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:56.306]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[00:17:56.526 --> 00:17:58.387]  But if you don't like it, you hate women.
[00:17:59.189 --> 00:18:03.273]  I talked to Ron Paul this week, Congressman, and I said, why don't we move to block her getting the speakership?
[00:18:03.293 --> 00:18:04.974]  He said, oh no, you can't do that.
[00:18:05.054 --> 00:18:05.715]  She's a woman.
[00:18:06.035 --> 00:18:10.639]  Look, I don't care if it's a hermaphrodite speaker, as long as they're pro-Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:12.381]  I could care less if you're a woman.
[00:18:12.561 --> 00:18:15.864]  And they use that as a football issue because it's something mindless.
[00:18:16.244 --> 00:18:20.967]  And petty that the soccer moms and the soccer dads of America can understand.
[00:18:21.207 --> 00:18:23.289]  Oog, you go girl, the women are going to win.
[00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:29.853]  Now we've got Rupert Murdoch funding Hillary Clinton behind her, pushing her for president, endorsing her.
[00:18:30.053 --> 00:18:31.334]  He's been behind her for years.
[00:18:31.534 --> 00:18:32.995]  The Bushes are in league with the Clintons.
[00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:34.115]  It's staged.
[00:18:34.396 --> 00:18:36.217]  Figure it out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:36.537 --> 00:18:37.398]  All right, I said I'd go to calls.
[00:18:37.798 --> 00:18:41.020]  We've got Ray, we've got Jason, we've got George, we've got Randy, we've got Carl.
[00:18:41.775 --> 00:18:43.556]  Let's go to somebody closer to home here.
[00:18:43.596 --> 00:18:45.638]  Let's go to Ray in East Austin.
[00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:47.819]  He says he disagrees about something.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.880]  Ray, you're on the air.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.361]  Go ahead.
[00:18:50.201 --> 00:18:50.622]  Alex!
[00:18:51.302 --> 00:18:51.642]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:52.203 --> 00:18:54.284]  Hey, you know pretty soon there's going to be Alejandro, right?
[00:18:55.185 --> 00:19:01.369]  Listen, talking about Pelosi not wanting to impeach President Bush, you know, she's Speaker of the House.
[00:19:01.389 --> 00:19:02.670]  She's third in line.
[00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:04.692]  I think what I'm predicting is
[00:19:05.683 --> 00:19:07.484]  She doesn't impeach because she doesn't have to.
[00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:12.768]  All she has to do is wait for the next dove season when Cheney shoots Bush in the face, mortally wounding him.
[00:19:13.309 --> 00:19:16.071]  Bush is going to declare Cheney an enemy combatant.
[00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:17.912]  Voila.
[00:19:17.972 --> 00:19:19.573]  Very funny, sir, but let's get serious.
[00:19:19.593 --> 00:19:20.494]  You said you disagreed with him.
[00:19:20.514 --> 00:19:20.814]  What about?
[00:19:20.834 --> 00:19:23.776]  It's not that I disagree.
[00:19:24.016 --> 00:19:27.219]  It's not that he shouldn't be impeached.
[00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:32.382]  I think the reason she's not going to do it is because it's going to look bad for her and she's going to want to run for presidency in 2008.
[00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:36.450]  No, that's stabbing us in the back to vote it for her.
[00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.090]  I agree with you.
[00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:39.332]  She is stabbing us in the back already.
[00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:40.952]  But I think that's why she's doing it.
[00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:43.394]  Well, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:45.515]  It's because they want power.
[00:19:45.555 --> 00:19:49.097]  The Democrats for 43 years were in power until 1994.
[00:19:52.577 --> 00:19:55.878]  And I went and pulled the lever for Republicans in the Republican Revolution.
[00:19:56.158 --> 00:20:01.440]  And then Newt Gingrich came in to say all the right things, but to ensure that that revolution didn't actually take place.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.021]  He's a CFR member, Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:20:04.301 --> 00:20:05.441]  He rode herd on it.
[00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:07.082]  The exact opposite happened.
[00:20:07.422 --> 00:20:11.783]  So they're there to neutralize a real conservative revolution in this country.
[00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:18.746]  The big corporations have convinced conservative voters that they're on the same side and that they want smaller government.
[00:20:18.806 --> 00:20:22.087]  No, most of the spending is corporate welfare.
[00:20:23.737 --> 00:20:25.418]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:20:25.518 --> 00:20:28.741]  Let's speak with Randy in Arizona.
[00:20:29.181 --> 00:20:29.861]  Randy, welcome.
[00:20:31.883 --> 00:20:32.523]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[00:20:33.384 --> 00:20:42.190]  Hi, I was calling to see what your perspective is on the Colbert Report and the Daily Show and their influence on the midterm elections.
[00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:48.595]  Sure, it's entertaining, and I really think you have Democrats who are Democrats already watching this.
[00:20:49.445 --> 00:20:59.630]  The show, and frankly, a lot of people that watch Comedy Central aren't voters to begin with, and they had some big research, media research companies put out numbers this week that merit each other.
[00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.752]  The most influential person in politics across party lines is Rush Limbaugh.
[00:21:04.212 --> 00:21:16.918]  Then it moves down through CNN, Fox, ABC, Nightly News, and then way down the list, what was it, at 24% was the Colbert and Daily Show reports.
[00:21:16.938 --> 00:21:18.259]  But I find them very entertaining.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.507]  Well, you don't think it's going to shift now that the Democrats have come into power?
[00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:32.522]  I doubt it.
[00:21:32.722 --> 00:21:33.843]  No, I doubt it, sir.
[00:21:34.003 --> 00:21:36.605]  I mean, the Democrats have always been in power.
[00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:39.167]  I mean, it's like my left arm and my right arm.
[00:21:39.387 --> 00:21:42.170]  We never discuss the creature the arms are attached to.
[00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:48.715]  That's what I'm trying to get you here to do is to look at how our country's totally run by foreign corporations.
[00:21:48.755 --> 00:21:50.657]  The border is publicly being dissolved.
[00:21:50.897 --> 00:21:53.299]  The roads are openly being seized for private interest.
[00:21:53.659 --> 00:21:59.904]  I've interviewed former chief economist, World Bank, Nobel Prize winners, agreeing that they're grabbing the roads for the international tax.
[00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:02.106]  We're going into total enslavement.
[00:22:02.367 --> 00:22:04.388]  And the average Democrat's going, man, we had a victory.
[00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:05.349]  Yay, Pelosi!
[00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:10.814]  That victory means as much as when your favorite football team wins.
[00:22:11.234 --> 00:22:13.156]  It may feel good, but it's completely hollow.
[00:22:13.656 --> 00:22:15.016]  It's not going to help your bank account.
[00:22:15.257 --> 00:22:16.377]  It's not going to help your children.
[00:22:16.437 --> 00:22:17.857]  It's not going to help your grandchildren.
[00:22:18.077 --> 00:22:19.198]  It's not going to help this country.
[00:22:19.238 --> 00:22:20.338]  It's not going to cure cancer.
[00:22:20.598 --> 00:22:24.699]  It feels good at a primitive level to think that something happened.
[00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:28.981]  But I'm telling you, the same gangsters owned both sides of the football team.
[00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:30.001]  Okay?
[00:22:30.221 --> 00:22:31.982]  They owned all the horses in the race.
[00:22:32.622 --> 00:22:35.063]  And that's evidenced by, we're not going to impeach.
[00:22:35.263 --> 00:22:36.523]  We're not going to investigate.
[00:22:36.983 --> 00:22:39.424]  Okay, we're going to look at pulling out of Iraq in the next few years.
[00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:40.664]  Same thing Bush has always said.
[00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:42.505]  Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[00:22:43.044 --> 00:22:48.352]  When we get back, we'll go to Jason, George, Carl, and many others.
[00:22:48.372 --> 00:22:49.654]  I want to get your take on this election.
[00:22:49.674 --> 00:22:51.236]  If you disagree with me, call in.
[00:22:51.276 --> 00:22:52.037]  If you agree, call in.
[00:22:52.378 --> 00:22:55.563]  We'll be right back on the other side of this important news and other announcements.
[00:22:55.903 --> 00:22:56.324]  Stay with us.
[00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:02.646]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[00:23:02.726 --> 00:23:03.506]  What's wrong?
[00:23:03.526 --> 00:23:04.727]  I am so tired.
[00:23:04.787 --> 00:23:07.248]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:23:07.408 --> 00:23:08.488]  I have tried everything.
[00:23:08.548 --> 00:23:10.309]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:23:10.449 --> 00:23:11.589]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:23:11.729 --> 00:23:14.030]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:15.751]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[00:23:15.971 --> 00:23:18.032]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[00:23:18.132 --> 00:23:20.373]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:23:20.553 --> 00:23:21.073]  The what?

[00:25:00.295 --> 00:25:02.256]  Sometimes you feel like you're just a number.
[00:25:02.536 --> 00:25:07.838]  To the banks, the credit card companies, the lenders and financial institutions, you are just a number.
[00:25:08.138 --> 00:25:09.218]  Your credit score.
[00:25:09.498 --> 00:25:14.139]  And unless that number is above their standards, you get stuck paying more for everything.

[00:27:36.598 --> 00:27:38.499]  Top stories, big MSNBC poll.
[00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:47.074]  With 375,000 plus respondents, the question, do you believe President Bush's actions justify impeachment?
[00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:48.676]  The answer, yes.
[00:27:48.836 --> 00:27:57.002]  Between the secret spying, the deceptions leading to war, and more, there is plenty to justify putting him on trial.
[00:27:57.382 --> 00:28:00.865]  87%, 4.4% said no.
[00:28:01.345 --> 00:28:06.049]  Like any president, he has made a few missteps, but nothing approaching high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.542]  6.5% said no, the man has done absolutely nothing wrong.
[00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:12.244]  Impeachment would just be a political lynching.
[00:28:13.665 --> 00:28:16.227]  So George Bush pats conservatives on the head.
[00:28:17.528 --> 00:28:32.940]  But then he pushes for blanket, total, complete amnesty, and says he looks forward and smiles in a press conference with getting it now done with Nancy Pelosi, who says that's going to be the first order of business when they come back into session.
[00:28:34.113 --> 00:28:34.793]  In the new Congress.
[00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:38.354]  They've got a few weeks left in the old Congress with the Republican majority.
[00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:42.055]  They're going to come back in January in the new year.
[00:28:43.116 --> 00:28:45.816]  Now understand, major Gallup polls have been 90-91%.
[00:28:46.296 --> 00:28:54.059]  Everybody, the left, the right, it doesn't matter, libertarians, everybody knows it's more than 20 million illegals.
[00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:55.059]  It's more like 30 million.
[00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.281]  The country is unraveling.
[00:28:58.321 --> 00:29:02.183]  The illegal aliens are running around, by and large, saying this is really Mexico.
[00:29:02.823 --> 00:29:04.224]  It's driving down the wages.
[00:29:04.304 --> 00:29:05.985]  It's breaking down our sovereignty.
[00:29:06.465 --> 00:29:09.026]  It's hurting Americans of every race, color, and creed.
[00:29:09.807 --> 00:29:11.828]  But what does the Republicans and Democrats do?
[00:29:11.888 --> 00:29:15.129]  They say, we don't care what you want.
[00:29:15.229 --> 00:29:16.870]  We don't care what's constitutional.
[00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.671]  We don't care what the law of the land is.
[00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:24.194]  You know, the federal government is supposed to defend the country from invasion, and it's supposed to print the money, and...
[00:29:25.948 --> 00:29:26.528]  We're good to go.
[00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:49.735]  All of these anti-border people told you the opposite and lied to you, and now you're going to see the evidence of it.
[00:29:50.135 --> 00:29:56.920]  I mean, Bush passed legislation to allow the funding of a 700-mile fence.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.261]  There's no fence being built.
[00:29:58.522 --> 00:30:00.243]  There's not going to be any fence built.
[00:30:01.103 --> 00:30:01.704]  You understand?
[00:30:02.024 --> 00:30:04.846]  That's how dumb... I read the bill on air last week, by the way.
[00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.428]  I read the subsection for you, and you missed it.
[00:30:06.948 --> 00:30:09.490]  They are out in the open laughing at us
[00:30:10.012 --> 00:30:12.454]  That was the previous worst point in American history, debt-wise.
[00:30:12.474 --> 00:30:13.995]  We passed that point six months ago.
[00:30:41.408 --> 00:30:42.829]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:30:43.249 --> 00:30:46.291]  Later I'm going to get into what the Democrats are really saying.
[00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:47.872]  They're not really saying leave Iraq.
[00:30:47.892 --> 00:30:49.313]  They're saying the same thing the President said.
[00:30:49.713 --> 00:30:51.214]  Oh, set a timetable.
[00:30:51.615 --> 00:30:55.097]  They set a timetable two and a half years ago to bring the troops down to 20,000 by now.
[00:30:55.117 --> 00:30:55.637]  There's 160,000 there.
[00:30:55.697 --> 00:30:57.398]  They brought them down to 130,000 and then shot it back up to 160,000 plus.
[00:30:57.438 --> 00:30:58.239]  So, more smoke and mirrors.
[00:30:58.439 --> 00:30:58.979]  They put everything...
[00:31:07.443 --> 00:31:07.803]  We're good to go.
[00:31:29.006 --> 00:31:31.267]  Thanks for holding Carl, you're on the air.
[00:31:55.839 --> 00:31:56.921]  Hey, Alex.
[00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:57.641]  God bless you.
[00:31:57.661 --> 00:32:00.465]  Thanks for what you do to help wake up the sheeple.
[00:32:05.407 --> 00:32:09.431]  The military-industrial complex's murder of Kennedy is 10 days from today.
[00:32:09.451 --> 00:32:10.732]  It's 43 years this month.
[00:32:11.032 --> 00:32:15.596]  Well, I tell you, it just seems like a few days ago it was the 42nd anniversary.
[00:32:15.876 --> 00:32:16.517]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:16.557 --> 00:32:23.363]  Well, it's, you know, I think more and more people are finding out about September 11th and November 22nd.
[00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:26.345]  And, you know, you and many other people are helping.
[00:32:27.106 --> 00:32:29.628]  You know, there's an old saying, information is power.
[00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:31.470]  You know, more people wake up to...
[00:32:32.014 --> 00:32:32.635]  What's going on?
[00:32:52.338 --> 00:33:00.040]  Well, you know, we hear this every Christmas.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:12.262]  The government, the social engineers, have to engage in trauma-based mind control during the holidays, during those family times, to stick themselves in front of us and grandstand.
[00:33:12.582 --> 00:33:15.423]  The White House has been caught issuing fake terror alerts.
[00:33:15.783 --> 00:33:16.304]  We're good to go.
[00:33:29.153 --> 00:33:32.976]  98% of the time, it's just hype, but Israel and the U.S.
[00:33:33.016 --> 00:33:39.541]  and England have to have an excuse to strike Iran, and so I never put it past them to stage a new terror attack.
[00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:40.942]  I mean, they've done it over and over again.
[00:33:40.962 --> 00:33:42.163]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:33:42.183 --> 00:33:48.808]  Do you think they're going to do something big, maybe either here in Europe for the holidays to justify going into Iran or...
[00:33:49.666 --> 00:33:55.931]  But like September 11th, something that they're kind of telegraphing their punch is kind of their way of saying Merry Christmas.
[00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:58.373]  We're going to do this during the holiest time of the year.
[00:33:58.933 --> 00:34:01.996]  Sure, my point is, and I appreciate your call, is that they do that every Christmas.
[00:34:03.317 --> 00:34:08.060]  I mean, did you ever accidentally tape the news, maybe a football game around Christmas?
[00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:19.589]  In between, during halftime, they have a news alert that Al-Qaeda is going to get you any minute or Al-Qaeda might want to hit the sports stadiums.
[00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:22.930]  Basically, just prostrate yourself before government.
[00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.770]  Worship government.
[00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.770]  Give up all your rights.
[00:34:25.091 --> 00:34:26.731]  Don't worry about them getting rid of the borders.
[00:34:27.011 --> 00:34:29.012]  Don't worry about them devaluing the dollar.
[00:34:29.292 --> 00:34:31.333]  Don't worry about your property taxes going up.
[00:34:31.693 --> 00:34:34.834]  Just learn to worship government and everything will be all right.
[00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:38.193]  This is about trauma-based mind control.
[00:34:38.573 --> 00:34:41.613]  They are terrorizing the American people.
[00:34:41.934 --> 00:34:44.014]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Connecticut.
[00:34:44.074 --> 00:34:44.754]  Jason, welcome.
[00:34:45.734 --> 00:34:47.075]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:34:47.175 --> 00:34:47.495]  You bet.
[00:34:47.515 --> 00:34:47.835]  Go ahead.
[00:34:48.955 --> 00:34:49.435]  Good, thanks.
[00:34:49.975 --> 00:34:51.396]  I got your new movie, Terror Storm.
[00:34:51.436 --> 00:34:53.896]  I just want to say you did a great job on it and love it and everything.
[00:34:53.956 --> 00:34:57.437]  It hit number nine on the Amazon bestseller list last week.
[00:34:57.977 --> 00:34:59.018]  Well, that's great.
[00:34:59.118 --> 00:35:00.418]  When is your new film coming out?
[00:35:01.007 --> 00:35:03.931]  I hear you're making another one about getting down to the roof.
[00:35:03.991 --> 00:35:10.460]  If I didn't do radio shows and interviews and run about ten other things, it'd be done in about three months, probably six, seven, eight months.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.082]  I'll be the first one to buy it.
[00:35:12.442 --> 00:35:17.128]  Hey, listen, I just have a piece of a puzzle that I'm trying to put together there on September 11th.
[00:35:18.923 --> 00:35:26.907]  I know Silverstein and everything, you know, he basically said it right out of his mouth that he... Yeah, that's the owner of the World Press Center Complex said he blew it up, yeah.
[00:35:26.927 --> 00:35:27.748]  Yeah, he pulled it.
[00:35:28.088 --> 00:35:32.930]  Now, what happened, if a plane didn't hit the Pentagon, then what happened to the plane?
[00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:37.673]  Like, I'm sure it was accounted for when it left the airport, the passenger list and stuff.
[00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:39.530]  Stewardess and stuff.
[00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:44.632]  Like if you went missing tomorrow and you didn't show up for work, somebody would be calling up looking for you.
[00:35:45.092 --> 00:35:46.153]  You know what I mean?
[00:35:46.753 --> 00:35:48.534]  How many of my 9-11 films have you seen?
[00:35:49.834 --> 00:35:58.238]  To be honest with you, I just tuned on to you and I called up Loose Change, I think was the other one, and that was it.
[00:35:58.338 --> 00:36:00.819]  I just didn't quite get that part of it.
[00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:01.099]  Sure.
[00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.280]  I'm going to let you go because your phone sounds really bad.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.502]  But you can listen off air and I appreciate you calling.
[00:36:06.542 --> 00:36:07.502]  It's an important question.
[00:36:08.607 --> 00:36:23.473]  If you watch Road to Tyranny that I made four months after 9-11, 9-11 and Road to Tyranny, or if you watch The Masters of Terror that I made a year and a half after 9-11, or any of my other documentaries, you know, the newest is Terror Storm.
[00:36:23.513 --> 00:36:26.814]  We spend about 30 minutes of the two-hour film on 9-11.
[00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:33.296]  When we get back, I'll break down the Pentagon story itself.
[00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:37.158]  But if you notice, my films don't have the Pentagon in them.
[00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:39.170]  There's a reason for that.
[00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:41.312]  Okay, it's called a honeypot.
[00:36:41.973 --> 00:36:43.654]  We'll tell you what a honeypot is on the other side.
[00:36:43.674 --> 00:36:45.416]  And we'll continue with your phone calls.
[00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:47.638]  But I would like to hear from listeners about the election.
[00:36:47.658 --> 00:36:48.639]  I'd like to hear from Democrats.
[00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:49.780]  Are you mad at Nancy Pelosi?
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.702]  She's not going to impeach Lord Bush?
[00:36:52.783 --> 00:36:54.705]  Or do you love her now, conservatives?
[00:36:54.725 --> 00:36:55.686]  Do you love her?
[00:36:55.706 --> 00:36:58.528]  She's going to get rid of the borders with your master, George Bush.
[00:36:58.588 --> 00:36:59.189]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.516]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:37:04.716 --> 00:37:08.121]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:37:08.301 --> 00:37:11.746]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:37:12.037 --> 00:37:15.279]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:20.782]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:37:20.802 --> 00:37:30.427]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:37:30.567 --> 00:37:31.928]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:37:31.948 --> 00:37:37.331]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:42.276]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:37:42.296 --> 00:37:43.738]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:37:43.898 --> 00:37:47.762]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[00:38:35.323 --> 00:38:35.703]  We're good to go.
[00:39:00.679 --> 00:39:04.922]  Do you forget the names of the people you met last week, even the people you met last night?
[00:39:05.283 --> 00:39:11.647]  How would you like to be able to walk into a room, meet 50 people or more, and recall all their names instantly?

[00:41:22.371 --> 00:41:28.075]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[00:41:29.856 --> 00:41:32.457]  Yes, we're back live here on this Sunday afternoon.
[00:41:34.799 --> 00:41:41.603]  Earlier, I didn't finish making my point on what's happened with Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats.
[00:41:42.478 --> 00:41:49.880]  They've come into office claiming they were going to change things, and they say, we're not going to investigate the giant public executions in China.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.382]  We're not going to investigate the organ harvesting of political dissidents.
[00:41:54.402 --> 00:41:56.142]  That's one of the things Pelosi ran on.
[00:41:56.162 --> 00:41:59.383]  In fact, I have it right here in front of me from Reuters.
[00:41:59.423 --> 00:42:02.824]  Pelosi-led house seen not rocking boat on China.
[00:42:03.204 --> 00:42:06.585]  And it goes on to say that she promised she would, but now she's not going to.
[00:42:07.045 --> 00:42:08.646]  What a political prostitute.
[00:42:09.304 --> 00:42:10.224]  Totally sold out.
[00:42:10.504 --> 00:42:15.265]  They promised to start some type of impeachment investigation for lying about WMDs.
[00:42:15.525 --> 00:42:19.166]  We have the White House memo publicly admitted to by the White House.
[00:42:19.366 --> 00:42:20.366]  They say it's a real memo.
[00:42:20.866 --> 00:42:27.208]  The minutes of Blair and Bush meeting on the eve of the Gulf War saying we can stage the fine of WMDs, we can get a U.S.
[00:42:27.248 --> 00:42:28.648]  plane painted up like a U.N.
[00:42:28.688 --> 00:42:35.930]  aircraft and fly it low and get it shot down, how to provocate the war, how to provoke a turret, how to create a provocation.
[00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.690]  Provocate, I'm inventing words here.
[00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:40.391]  It goes on and on.
[00:42:40.912 --> 00:42:43.214]  What about the Military Commissions Act, H.R.
[00:42:43.234 --> 00:42:46.776]  6166, which abolishes nine of the ten amendments to the Bill of Rights?
[00:42:47.377 --> 00:42:49.478]  Oh, you're not going to hear that discussed now by the liberals.
[00:42:49.698 --> 00:42:51.820]  You probably won't hear Keith Oberman talk about it anymore.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.281]  You know, he was decrying it.
[00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:54.222]  I've read it.
[00:42:54.242 --> 00:42:55.262]  It affects citizens.
[00:42:55.302 --> 00:43:00.106]  It has nothing to do with fighting terror, even if you believe in the boogeyman they've created.
[00:43:01.147 --> 00:43:03.268]  Now all of that is consolidated.
[00:43:03.328 --> 00:43:06.871]  Now Rupert Murdoch's in Fox News is going to be behind Hillary for president.
[00:43:07.699 --> 00:43:08.881]  And we're going to be in trouble, folks.
[00:43:09.241 --> 00:43:15.571]  Most neocon conservatives in this country, if Hillary becomes president, will support her in wars, attacking foreign countries.
[00:43:15.851 --> 00:43:17.854]  They will support her even taking guns.
[00:43:18.295 --> 00:43:23.402]  As long as you attach it to some, well, at least we're going to kill Arabs, okay, then I'll give up all my rights then!
[00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:27.184]  It's one party against the American people.
[00:43:27.685 --> 00:43:28.965]  It's not about left and right.
[00:43:29.165 --> 00:43:31.166]  It's about the state versus you.
[00:43:31.226 --> 00:43:32.286]  And who controls that state?
[00:43:32.567 --> 00:43:37.448]  The big private central banks that have private families that own them as shareholders.
[00:43:37.749 --> 00:43:38.789]  That is admitted.
[00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:39.849]  And I'm mad.
[00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:42.571]  Now, the last caller wanted me to talk about the Pentagon.
[00:43:43.591 --> 00:43:48.593]  Every radio interview I do, and I do on average two or three a day.
[00:43:48.653 --> 00:43:49.593]  Sometimes I do ten a day.
[00:43:49.633 --> 00:43:50.254]  It's ridiculous.
[00:43:50.514 --> 00:43:51.874]  It seems to come in fits and spurts.
[00:43:51.914 --> 00:43:53.555]  I wish it was evenly spaced out, but it's not.
[00:43:54.364 --> 00:43:57.785]  And, I mean, I'll do interview after interview on shows that agree, shows that disagree.
[00:43:57.805 --> 00:43:58.345]  It doesn't matter.
[00:43:58.365 --> 00:44:03.167]  And they'll go, well, if 9-11's an inside job, where are the real airplanes?
[00:44:04.067 --> 00:44:09.369]  And I say, am I saying there weren't real airplanes, weren't real people on board the aircraft?
[00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:14.111]  You see, in any black op, they fog things.
[00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.371]  They can fuse things.
[00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:17.372]  They have simultaneous things going on.
[00:44:17.752 --> 00:44:20.253]  There were over 24 hijacked aircraft.
[00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:27.573]  In the NORAD slash CIA drill, and again, I reported on this almost two years before it was in the cover of USA Today.
[00:44:29.014 --> 00:44:31.396]  Go watch my films like Road to Terror and Masters of Terror.
[00:44:31.796 --> 00:44:36.239]  Before the drill news was ever on the news, I knew about it from my sources.
[00:44:36.699 --> 00:44:37.820]  That's why we have credibility here.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.462]  What we talk about comes out or develops or happens.
[00:44:42.263 --> 00:44:43.584]  This is serious information.
[00:44:43.804 --> 00:44:47.266]  You go, what's a drill have to do with no plane hitting the Pentagon?
[00:44:48.433 --> 00:45:10.244]  The government was running drills of 24 hijacked jets flying to the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, CIA headquarters, the Capitol, the White House, the Travelers Insurance Building in San Francisco, the Sears Tower in Chicago, sites in Dallas, 24 places, okay?
[00:45:12.921 --> 00:45:17.865]  And so NORAD, full of good patriots, kept saying on the tapes they've now released, is this part of the drill?
[00:45:18.045 --> 00:45:19.486]  Is that part of the drill?
[00:45:19.747 --> 00:45:23.390]  I've never seen so much real world stuff during a drill.
[00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:28.614]  It's so much real world because they always have real jets with real U.S.
[00:45:28.714 --> 00:45:31.677]  agents on them practicing sneaking bombs on board.
[00:45:31.697 --> 00:45:32.577]  They're not real bombs.
[00:45:33.078 --> 00:45:38.442]  You always hear about the BATF snuck through a bomb on the airport or the Navy SEALs were able to infiltrate the U.S.
[00:45:38.522 --> 00:45:38.882]  Embassy.
[00:45:39.283 --> 00:45:40.884]  They do this constantly.
[00:45:40.924 --> 00:45:41.705]  Well, that day...
[00:45:42.375 --> 00:45:45.416]  You have to understand, all I know is this, okay?
[00:45:46.616 --> 00:45:48.136]  I know the official story is a fraud.
[00:45:48.816 --> 00:45:49.896]  I know we're being lied to.
[00:45:49.976 --> 00:45:55.678]  And I know the mainstream media loves to focus in on those that only look at no plane hitting the Pentagon.
[00:45:56.078 --> 00:45:57.658]  I don't know what the truth is there.
[00:45:57.698 --> 00:46:06.860]  I know it's very suspicious how they grab the surveillance tapes and how they told everybody to shut up, how they locked the Pentagon down, and some people reported a missile, some a plane, some a big plane.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.020]  I don't know.
[00:46:10.245 --> 00:46:23.318]  And it's, again, like if I am a criminal investigator or detective, and we catch a guy driving down the highway drunk, and we smell something, and so we get a, you know, it's probable cause, we pop the trunk, there's a dead body, a rotten body of a woman in there.
[00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:24.519]  Okay?
[00:46:24.959 --> 00:46:27.582]  And I've actually shown you a lot of criminology.
[00:46:27.602 --> 00:46:28.903]  There have been real cases like this.
[00:46:29.364 --> 00:46:33.488]  And they go out to the guy's farm, and buried in the woods is 20-something dead bodies.
[00:46:33.568 --> 00:46:33.648]  Okay?
[00:46:33.668 --> 00:46:33.828]  Okay?
[00:46:34.642 --> 00:46:35.362]  And they dig him up.
[00:46:35.422 --> 00:46:37.283]  Now, this guy will go to the electric chair.
[00:46:37.543 --> 00:46:39.143]  He'll go to the lethal injection chair.
[00:46:39.524 --> 00:46:42.845]  Never saying how he killed who, when he killed them.
[00:46:43.505 --> 00:46:46.586]  The police will have hell trying to find out when these women were kidnapped.
[00:46:46.986 --> 00:46:54.628]  All I know is, as a prosecutor, when I go in before the jury, I'm going to say, we found him, Your Honor, with the dead woman.
[00:46:54.828 --> 00:46:56.609]  And we found the dead bodies on his property.
[00:46:57.849 --> 00:46:58.189]  Okay?
[00:46:58.229 --> 00:47:03.151]  And we found implements that match the murder wounds that are forensic based.
[00:47:04.136 --> 00:47:04.836]  We're good to go.
[00:47:04.877 --> 00:47:05.777]  We're good to go.
[00:47:31.894 --> 00:47:35.516]  The other 12 or 13 hijackers, depending on which number you look at, were trained at U.S.
[00:47:35.636 --> 00:47:39.318]  spy bases all over the world in the U.S.
[00:47:39.358 --> 00:47:40.438]  on record.
[00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:56.771]  And we know they were taking part in the drill that day.
[00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:59.891]  And people go, well, you mean they were government agents and then they were double agents?
[00:47:59.951 --> 00:48:00.772]  That's the new spin.
[00:48:01.072 --> 00:48:01.992]  Oh, they're double agents.
[00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:02.752]  They're triple agents.
[00:48:02.972 --> 00:48:03.912]  There's TV specials about.
[00:48:04.112 --> 00:48:05.112]  We were triple crossed.
[00:48:05.192 --> 00:48:05.753]  Okay, they were.
[00:48:05.773 --> 00:48:07.073]  I mean, that's now on national TV.
[00:48:07.353 --> 00:48:11.814]  Okay, they weren't working for the U.S., but then they stabbed us in the back at the last minute.
[00:48:12.134 --> 00:48:14.454]  No, they lived with topless dancers and hookers.
[00:48:15.054 --> 00:48:15.975]  They were doing drugs.
[00:48:15.995 --> 00:48:17.795]  They were constantly at topless bars.
[00:48:18.223 --> 00:48:19.304]  They weren't Muslims.
[00:48:19.604 --> 00:48:21.104]  These were recruited, U.S.
[00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:24.366]  trained, highly paid decoys.
[00:48:25.126 --> 00:48:26.407]  Okay, and how do I know this?
[00:48:29.108 --> 00:48:34.651]  A month after 9-11, the San Jose Mercury News and the AP picked up the story, and I'm paraphrasing.
[00:48:34.671 --> 00:48:35.831]  This is probably the exact headline.
[00:48:35.851 --> 00:48:46.396]  My memory is pretty good, but it was, George Bush made 9-11 happen, and then under it, Dean of Defense Language School says hijackers trained at his base.
[00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:50.762]  And you can just type in Dean of Defense Language School, 9-11 Hijackers.
[00:48:50.822 --> 00:48:51.302]  It'll come up.
[00:48:51.582 --> 00:48:53.443]  Both the AP and the San Jose Mercury News.
[00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:54.824]  I called him, talked to him.
[00:48:54.864 --> 00:48:55.465]  He'd been threatened.
[00:48:55.485 --> 00:48:56.606]  They were starting to court-martial him.
[00:48:56.846 --> 00:48:58.027]  They dropped it if he'd shut up.
[00:48:58.067 --> 00:48:59.408]  He said he couldn't talk anymore.
[00:48:59.928 --> 00:49:01.029]  But he was already on record.
[00:49:01.049 --> 00:49:02.330]  He said that's all he needed to say.
[00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:07.493]  This is a full bird colonel, highly decorated, a patriot.
[00:49:07.714 --> 00:49:09.215]  He said these guys are U.S.
[00:49:09.355 --> 00:49:09.695]  agents.
[00:49:10.535 --> 00:49:11.576]  Our government did this.
[00:49:11.836 --> 00:49:13.838]  I mean, that's not hard to do.
[00:49:14.198 --> 00:49:15.519]  That's not hard to figure out.
[00:49:15.559 --> 00:49:16.680]  Well, it doesn't stop with him.
[00:49:17.509 --> 00:49:30.054]  MSNBC, Newsweek, Pensacola News Journal all reported three of the other hijackers trained in covert flight school training, not at private flight schools, but at the government flight school there at the base.
[00:49:31.575 --> 00:49:39.958]  Then a week later, after 9-11, it came out, and then the guy was still alive with the same name, same photo, but then he's in a trainer, and it crashes and kills all aboard.
[00:49:41.219 --> 00:49:42.119]  Got rid of him real quick.
[00:49:42.523 --> 00:49:44.344]  They also had lots of guys with the same names.
[00:49:44.364 --> 00:49:46.805]  They would give these agents the same names for some reason.
[00:49:47.266 --> 00:49:56.651]  Then, I interviewed two embassy heads, one from Canada, Ottawa, the other from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Mr. Springman.
[00:49:58.392 --> 00:50:00.553]  And he was in Canadian newspapers is how I got him on.
[00:50:00.573 --> 00:50:01.253]  The U.S.
[00:50:01.293 --> 00:50:01.873]  wouldn't cover it.
[00:50:02.214 --> 00:50:04.535]  So I call him up, I get him on, he goes, listen to me.
[00:50:05.137 --> 00:50:18.064]  Two years ago, when they went to the Al-Qaeda summit in 2000, or I guess he said a year at the time, he said they were coming back through Riyadh, and on the computers it said they were Al-Qaeda terrorists, and so I refused visas back into the U.S.
[00:50:18.525 --> 00:50:21.386]  Well, a day later, I get a call from the State Department saying let them through.
[00:50:21.426 --> 00:50:21.987]  Then I won't.
[00:50:22.107 --> 00:50:29.050]  Then the State Department Deputy Secretary calls up and says, you will let them in, and...
[00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:34.732]  Springman demanded security codes, and they gave them to him saying, U.S.
[00:50:35.012 --> 00:50:39.373]  government covert operatives for defense intelligence and CIA.
[00:50:39.693 --> 00:50:41.293]  Do you hear me?
[00:50:41.493 --> 00:50:43.153]  Do you hear me?
[00:50:43.453 --> 00:50:44.393]  Not debatable.
[00:50:44.754 --> 00:50:45.514]  On the record.
[00:50:46.134 --> 00:50:47.154]  And it goes on from there.
[00:50:47.194 --> 00:50:56.236]  You've got them in San Diego with FBI informants and agents paying for the houses they live in and living with them and their credit cards, their cars, everything.
[00:50:56.716 --> 00:50:58.676]  You understand me, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:03.392]  Now that's just one piece of evidence of over 600 that we know.
[00:51:03.972 --> 00:51:07.914]  Yes, I've got them posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:51:08.375 --> 00:51:16.959]  There are over 600 smoking guns that you cannot debate.
[00:51:17.319 --> 00:51:28.825]  And every one of them, it's the equivalent of finding the murderer with a dead body and there's a scratch on his chest and the dead body of the poor woman has his
[00:51:29.426 --> 00:51:31.068]  Has his skin under her fingernails.
[00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:34.692]  And then they find the dead bodies at the house.
[00:51:34.772 --> 00:51:36.634]  I mean, the guy will never talk.
[00:51:36.974 --> 00:51:38.556]  He's never going to tell us exactly how he did it.
[00:51:38.756 --> 00:51:40.078]  We just know he's involved.
[00:51:41.059 --> 00:51:42.941]  It's criminal elements of our government.
[00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:44.783]  The same ones getting rid of our borders.
[00:51:45.303 --> 00:51:48.427]  We'll be right back with your calls and a ton of news in the second hour.
[00:51:48.467 --> 00:51:49.268]  You don't want to miss it!
[00:51:50.396 --> 00:51:51.317]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.

[00:53:45.959 --> 00:53:49.900]  Hey, look, I'll be the same today, tomorrow, next month.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:50.940]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.681]  I believe in the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[00:53:52.701 --> 00:53:54.801]  I believe in national sovereignty.
[00:53:54.861 --> 00:54:00.643]  Nancy Pelosi comes into office, and they're going to keep us in Iraq at least for a couple more years.
[00:54:00.723 --> 00:54:03.303]  They're not going to impeach Bush for lying about WMDs.
[00:54:04.184 --> 00:54:07.044]  They're with Bush on blanket amnesty and open borders.
[00:54:07.425 --> 00:54:12.826]  They say that's the first order of business when the new Congress comes into session in about two months.
[00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:19.631]  Nancy Pelosi is saying that meet the new boss seems the old boss, like the old Who song goes.
[00:54:20.572 --> 00:54:21.452]  And it upsets me.
[00:54:21.652 --> 00:54:22.253]  It upsets me.
[00:54:22.533 --> 00:54:25.154]  In fact, all these Democrats were so upset.
[00:54:25.174 --> 00:54:27.535]  Oh, the Military Commissions Act, it affects U.S.
[00:54:27.595 --> 00:54:28.075]  citizens.
[00:54:28.135 --> 00:54:28.995]  It's fascism.
[00:54:29.035 --> 00:54:30.016]  Bush is a dictator.
[00:54:31.118 --> 00:54:33.759]  And then now, Pelosi comes in and says, that's off the table.
[00:54:33.919 --> 00:54:38.780]  They're not talking about repealing the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, none of it.
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:57.464]  In the Defense Authorization Act that Bush signed October 17th, about a month ago, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, it clearly says, I covered it on air last week, that the 1878 law against the military engaging in law enforcement is abolished.
[00:54:57.504 --> 00:54:58.344]  It makes the governor's
[00:54:59.265 --> 00:55:06.048]  Basically vassals of the executive and destroys anything, any vestige of the Tenth Amendment states' rights.
[00:55:06.728 --> 00:55:14.651]  We haven't been under this level of executive and, well, federalist authority since the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction.
[00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.392]  So we're under martial law right now.
[00:55:17.472 --> 00:55:21.153]  It's kind of like, you know, the cop's got the gun cocked and up against your head.
[00:55:21.554 --> 00:55:23.814]  Now, he hasn't pulled the trigger yet.
[00:55:23.854 --> 00:55:25.275]  They haven't implemented it.
[00:55:26.872 --> 00:55:33.535]  Well, they're kind of implementing it in a slow-motion fashion, but they haven't really dropped the guillotine's blade quite yet.
[00:55:33.756 --> 00:55:38.218]  But the whole thing's in place, and then Bush may just fade off into oblivion.
[00:55:38.238 --> 00:55:42.540]  Everybody thought Bill Clinton was going to set up a dictatorship because all the signs were there.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:47.763]  Getting rid of Posse Comitatus incrementally, militarizing the police, building FEMA camps.
[00:55:48.083 --> 00:55:49.204]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:55:49.464 --> 00:55:51.825]  Houston Chronicle, oh, they're building camps for the American people.
[00:55:52.305 --> 00:55:53.086]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[00:55:53.146 --> 00:55:53.726]  It's needed.
[00:55:54.087 --> 00:55:55.748]  And oh, we need to give up all of our rights.
[00:55:55.808 --> 00:55:57.750]  And don't worry, George Bush won't abuse him.
[00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.231]  Well, let's say George Bush is really a good guy, which he isn't.
[00:56:00.952 --> 00:56:01.913]  He's also running nothing.
[00:56:01.933 --> 00:56:02.493]  He's a puppet.
[00:56:02.773 --> 00:56:05.636]  What about Hillary or some Democrat getting in in two years?
[00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:16.184]  You see, so I'm asking Democratic listeners out there, I'm asking Republicans out there, I'm asking independents out there, I'm asking truth-seekers and constitutionalists out there, what do you see happening now?
[00:56:16.464 --> 00:56:18.446]  Are you as upset as I am
[00:56:19.486 --> 00:56:23.948]  I mean, I expected some talk of impeachment, at least some talk of investigations.
[00:56:24.088 --> 00:56:24.448]  No!
[00:56:25.888 --> 00:56:32.170]  Because what you have is the Republicans and the Democrats more than ever circling the wagons against the people.
[00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:42.334]  With the impeachment in 1998 that I supported, you had them go after Bill Clinton on sexual issues and lying to Congress.
[00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:47.939]  Because they couldn't go after him for missile secrets to China, nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[00:56:48.219 --> 00:57:03.387]  They couldn't go after Clinton for botulism and anthrax to Saddam, because it was Republican kingmakers who were involved in all of that, who were Donald Rumsfeld and James Baker and George Shultz.
[00:57:03.407 --> 00:57:08.850]  If you don't know those names, you better find out who they are, because they've been in power for six administrations.
[00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:12.391]  Reagan was a puppet of these guys.
[00:57:12.992 --> 00:57:13.612]  Bush Sr.
[00:57:13.652 --> 00:57:20.515]  was, Clinton, and now Bush, more than halfway into his second administration.
[00:57:20.975 --> 00:57:22.756]  And these are the former CIA directors.
[00:57:22.776 --> 00:57:24.057]  These are the intelligence ops.
[00:57:24.117 --> 00:57:27.758]  It's like Vladimir Putin, former intelligence chief in Russia.
[00:57:28.159 --> 00:57:29.559]  He's now the boss there.
[00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.760]  He uses stage terror to stay in control.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.662]  So everybody loves him, and he can talk about how he's there to save everyone.
[00:57:35.942 --> 00:57:37.903]  This is how they're getting their tyranny through.
[00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:43.915]  Coming up later in the hour, I want to get into the Democrats say they will, quote, push for Iraq withdrawal.
[00:57:43.955 --> 00:57:45.256]  That's a deceiving headline.
[00:57:45.276 --> 00:57:46.257]  You read the actual story.
[00:57:46.277 --> 00:57:47.739]  They're not pushing for that.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:58.330]  Also, Time Magazine is reporting that charges are sought against Rumsfeld over Pentagon abuse on war crimes by those tortured at Abu Ghraib falsely.
[00:57:59.401 --> 00:58:06.165]  Also, Venezuela officially says 9-11 was self-inflicted, calls for a worldwide investigation.
[00:58:06.466 --> 00:58:08.227]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:58:08.307 --> 00:58:12.389]  I do want to invite you to call in specifically on the election at 877-590-5525.
[00:58:12.429 --> 00:58:12.710]  That's 877-590-5525.
[00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:15.591]  Or locally here in Central Texas, if you listen to us from the mothership, KLBJ 590, 836-0590.
[00:58:26.438 --> 00:58:30.882]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Florida.
[00:58:30.982 --> 00:58:31.583]  Welcome, sir.
[00:58:31.603 --> 00:58:33.384]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:58:33.445 --> 00:58:33.765]  Good.
[00:58:34.586 --> 00:58:44.594]  Yes, I'm talking to my state senator, and he's very interested in me going for the State Senate Judiciary Committee because looking at how the U.S.
[00:58:44.634 --> 00:58:53.322]  Senate is being controlled by elites, I'm looking to try to get the states into a constitutional showdown to repeal the 17th Amendment because
[00:58:53.826 --> 00:58:57.148]  Like the Income Tax Amendment, the 17th Amendment was never ratified.
[00:58:57.689 --> 00:58:59.550]  Two-thirds by the two-thirds states.
[00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:00.650]  It was just implemented.
[00:59:01.251 --> 00:59:16.701]  And if you look at the history since the 17th Amendment... Well, remember, a lot of our listeners, I mean the general public, Americans are smart at looking cool and talking sharp and making money at the car lot, but Americans on average cannot name the continents.
[00:59:17.061 --> 00:59:18.742]  They can't find Iraq on a map.
[00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:21.743]  They don't even know which way the Nile flows.
[00:59:21.763 --> 00:59:26.787]  They don't know basic facts, much less about their Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[00:59:26.827 --> 00:59:29.228]  So why don't you tell folks what the 17th Amendment is?
[00:59:30.009 --> 00:59:39.376]  The 17th Amendment repealed the states appointing, allowing the legislatures of the states to appoint... Yeah, it took the senators away from...
[00:59:39.901 --> 00:59:43.523]  The states, and I appreciate your call, that's a key.
[00:59:43.544 --> 00:59:56.512]  1913, the private Federal Reserve had the committee chairman vote that a private banking cartel take control of the currency of the country, and that debt would be created for the government to have the right to print money.
[00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:57.653]  I mean, it's designed.
[00:59:57.893 --> 00:59:59.434]  It's impossible to get out of debt.
[00:59:59.654 --> 01:00:01.195]  It's designed to implode our economy.
[01:00:02.096 --> 01:00:06.459]  And now, 90 years later, we are basically bankrupt right now.
[01:00:06.499 --> 01:00:07.960]  They just haven't told you yet.
[01:00:08.778 --> 01:00:10.579]  And the dollar is worth one cent.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.782]  You'll hear people say it's worth three pennies to the dollar.
[01:00:14.822 --> 01:00:16.083]  No, that was a couple years ago.
[01:00:16.123 --> 01:00:18.444]  It's one cent to the dollar of what it was in 1913.
[01:00:20.343 --> 01:00:25.626]  And that very same year, they gave us the 17th Amendment.
[01:00:26.226 --> 01:00:28.767]  And previously, you would go elect your state rep.
[01:00:28.847 --> 01:00:31.028]  I mean, where you could really get your hands on them.
[01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:36.251]  And then the legislature would vote on the senators and send the two senators from each state.
[01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:43.895]  And so the upper chamber of the Congress there at the Capitol was a creature of the states.
[01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:45.355]  The states were the bosses.
[01:00:46.056 --> 01:00:48.697]  And yes, the 17th Amendment is absolutely horrible.
[01:00:49.577 --> 01:00:54.699]  And now they want to get rid of the electoral college, another bad idea.
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.641]  It's about states' power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:57.901 --> 01:01:01.002]  It's not, oh, they're ripping you off, keeping you from a general election.
[01:01:01.402 --> 01:01:05.404]  It is a general election because the states then apportion those votes.
[01:01:05.904 --> 01:01:10.226]  Again, it gets into the parliamentary procedures, and if you don't know them, that's why you're a slave.
[01:01:10.486 --> 01:01:11.287]  You really need to learn them.
[01:01:11.967 --> 01:01:13.408]  They're very interesting at the same time.
[01:01:13.708 --> 01:01:15.909]  Let's go ahead and talk to Danny in Tennessee.
[01:01:15.929 --> 01:01:16.629]  Danny, welcome.
[01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:18.210]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.541]  Hello, go ahead, sir.
[01:01:19.821 --> 01:01:23.366]  Yeah, I spoke with you briefly on Friday about Arnold and everything.
[01:01:23.386 --> 01:01:29.253]  You know, the election was, you know, they basically picked the people that are going to help them further their agenda.
[01:01:29.313 --> 01:01:30.715]  You know, that's what the New World Order did.
[01:01:30.735 --> 01:01:38.264]  Yeah, Arnold was wildly unpopular in polls, had 32% approval in most polls, but magically won.
[01:01:38.744 --> 01:01:39.204]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:01:39.225 --> 01:01:40.766]  That's how I saw it, you know, because...
[01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:13.275]  It's like they have him sitting there waiting for a possible candidate to compete with Clinton.
[01:02:14.337 --> 01:02:15.458]  That's the way I was looking at it.
[01:02:16.118 --> 01:02:18.801]  I just wanted you to go into detail about that.
[01:02:19.382 --> 01:02:21.404]  Well, he's definitely in the spook camp.
[01:02:21.684 --> 01:02:27.630]  Up there at A&M, he got that big award from Bush, who's been president for six terms, George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:02:28.508 --> 01:02:30.069]  And he's president right now.
[01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:31.890]  Even Time Magazine says he's the president.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:34.731]  He'll be probably the president until he's 100 years old.
[01:02:35.471 --> 01:02:37.012]  Even when Hillary's in, she's CIA.
[01:02:37.052 --> 01:02:40.614]  Been working for him since he was a case officer over her in the late 60s.
[01:02:41.114 --> 01:02:42.214]  So, great points.
[01:02:42.594 --> 01:02:45.936]  We'll come back, talk to Keith and many others.
[01:02:46.036 --> 01:02:47.317]  Tons of news straight ahead.
[01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.017]  Stay with us.
[01:02:52.234 --> 01:03:00.162]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:03:00.623 --> 01:03:03.806]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:07.210]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:12.435]  Just visit herbalhealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:15.198]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:20.596]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest, and effective weight loss products?
[01:03:21.116 --> 01:03:26.982]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[01:03:27.302 --> 01:03:28.463]  And don't forget your pets.
[01:03:28.923 --> 01:03:34.589]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows, and birds.
[01:03:35.049 --> 01:03:35.950]  We're good to go.
[01:03:51.647 --> 01:03:52.787]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:03:52.807 --> 01:03:53.607]  Today is November 10th, 2006.
[01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:57.888]  Gold opened at $6.32 an ounce, and one-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.58.92 and $3.30.48 for half-ounce coins.
[01:03:57.928 --> 01:03:58.268]  That's $6.58.92 and $3.30.48.
[01:03:58.328 --> 01:04:05.410]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:04:19.432 --> 01:04:22.694]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:04:23.155 --> 01:04:26.597]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:04:26.657 --> 01:04:29.679]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[01:04:30.119 --> 01:04:32.961]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:04:33.201 --> 01:04:33.501]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:36.723 --> 01:04:40.168]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:40.188 --> 01:04:40.448]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:55.436 --> 01:04:58.578]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:00.879]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:08.904]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.564 --> 01:05:16.629]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:19.971]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:20.311 --> 01:05:22.672]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:23.093 --> 01:05:23.933]  NSA spies.
[01:05:25.326 --> 01:05:28.448]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:05:28.748 --> 01:05:32.269]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.709 --> 01:05:34.610]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:38.892]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:08.854 --> 01:07:10.416]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:25.052]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to get into these two reports.
[01:07:26.053 --> 01:07:26.673]  Very important.
[01:07:26.693 --> 01:07:30.215]  Venezuela officially says 9-11 was self-inflicted.
[01:07:30.235 --> 01:07:32.096]  This is out of the Miami Herald.
[01:07:32.116 --> 01:07:36.318]  We'll read you some of what's in the report from their parliament.
[01:07:37.959 --> 01:07:40.740]  Also, a story here out of Time Magazine.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:48.224]  Charges sought against Rumsfeld over prison abuse by an international war crimes tribunal in Germany.
[01:07:48.971 --> 01:07:52.793]  And we'll be covering that, and you're welcome to call in and give us your take on it.
[01:07:54.494 --> 01:08:06.121]  But recapping, the Democrats have come in, there's going to be no impeachment, no repeal of Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, Defense Authorization, and that stuff really does dismantle the Bill of Rights.
[01:08:06.662 --> 01:08:15.227]  You know, on Veterans Day yesterday, Saturday, I hope you thought about why we appreciate the veterans, because they supposedly, at least I know they thought they were,
[01:08:19.504 --> 01:08:20.544]  We're just more dirt.
[01:08:20.584 --> 01:08:23.005]  We're just another country if we don't have that.
[01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:28.347]  And by the way, under these new pieces of legislation, we go far past just not having a Bill of Rights.
[01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.688]  We go further than even Hitler did.
[01:08:30.968 --> 01:08:34.209]  He didn't put stuff on paper where citizens don't have any due process.
[01:08:34.489 --> 01:08:35.329]  He just did it.
[01:08:35.876 --> 01:08:37.577]  Pinochet didn't put it on paper.
[01:08:37.817 --> 01:08:38.538]  He just did it.
[01:08:38.878 --> 01:08:40.439]  Pol Pot didn't put it on paper.
[01:08:40.639 --> 01:08:42.100]  He just did it in Cambodia.
[01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:45.443]  Same thing with the rest of these people.
[01:08:45.523 --> 01:08:46.023]  Stalin.
[01:08:46.383 --> 01:08:47.564]  This is scary stuff.
[01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:48.845]  And now you're going to have the Democrats.
[01:08:48.925 --> 01:08:49.586]  Oh, they love it.
[01:08:50.106 --> 01:08:52.448]  They wanted a police state back when they were in power in the 90s.
[01:08:53.708 --> 01:08:54.689]  And now they're going to get it.
[01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.950]  And so I kept warning conservatives.
[01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.491]  You watch.
[01:08:57.511 --> 01:09:02.894]  When Democrats come to power, you're going to have to now live under a Hillary or somebody like that.
[01:09:02.934 --> 01:09:04.735]  And you know the BATF's going to use this.
[01:09:04.995 --> 01:09:06.596]  You know they're going to use it against gun owners.
[01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:08.578]  You know they hate our guts.
[01:09:08.638 --> 01:09:09.698]  You know what they're all about.
[01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:16.362]  In fact, I heard some local news here out of the KLBJ studios that we do the show out of here, syndicated.
[01:09:17.043 --> 01:09:20.625]  And during a break, they had some state rep on there going,
[01:09:21.352 --> 01:09:24.995]  Oh, it's ridiculous that the property taxes make people lose their homes.
[01:09:25.055 --> 01:09:26.677]  I've never heard of such a thing.
[01:09:27.157 --> 01:09:30.820]  It reminded me of Nelda Wells Spears, the county tax assessor.
[01:09:31.161 --> 01:09:32.202]  I think she still is.
[01:09:32.222 --> 01:09:40.168]  I remember, like, ten years ago, though, she testified in front of the county commissioners, and I was down there, and she said, We never take people's homes.
[01:09:40.208 --> 01:09:41.129]  That's a lie.
[01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:42.330]  Well, we had all these...
[01:09:43.775 --> 01:09:45.377]  Stuff taped off the local channel 17.
[01:09:46.017 --> 01:09:52.463]  The county has their own cable channel where it was showing hundreds of stolen homes repossessed, grabbed, taken.
[01:09:52.924 --> 01:09:57.408]  I know people who've had the constables come and they throw you out and grab your house.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.602]  We walk up to her and we say, you take people's houses all the time.
[01:10:02.043 --> 01:10:03.324]  She goes, no, that's not true.
[01:10:03.344 --> 01:10:04.044]  That's a lie.
[01:10:04.364 --> 01:10:05.385]  No, you're a liar.
[01:10:05.425 --> 01:10:06.946]  How dumb do you think we are?
[01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:10.729]  You don't take people's property if they don't pay property tax.
[01:10:11.329 --> 01:10:13.791]  In fact, I meant to ask you in the last hour when I heard that.
[01:10:14.652 --> 01:10:16.073]  I think it was at the bottom of the hour news.
[01:10:16.233 --> 01:10:17.254]  Or maybe it was the start of the show.
[01:10:17.974 --> 01:10:21.537]  Trey, do you think you can go check with the news guys and see if I can find that?
[01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:26.220]  Maybe we'll end the show with that liar, this state rep.
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:27.000]  What was his name?
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:27.641]  Villarreal?
[01:10:28.621 --> 01:10:29.361]  I wrote it down here.
[01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:31.182]  All right, I said I'd go to calls, and I'm not doing it.
[01:10:31.702 --> 01:10:33.823]  We've got people calling in about the election.
[01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:34.364]  Hallelujah!
[01:10:34.384 --> 01:10:36.785]  We'll go to others that are calling in about other subjects.
[01:10:36.825 --> 01:10:37.225]  Don't worry.
[01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:43.188]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick, who's calling from Salado Tejas, listening on 590 KLBJ.
[01:10:43.268 --> 01:10:43.788]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:46.189]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:10:46.489 --> 01:10:47.230]  Hello, my friend.
[01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:48.590]  I really enjoy the show.
[01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.831]  Let me be brief.
[01:10:50.411 --> 01:10:51.732]  I agree with you completely.
[01:10:51.772 --> 01:10:56.734]  When my mom and dad went to go to the vote, they asked me who I should...
[01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:59.231]  Who they should vote for, and I said it doesn't matter.
[01:10:59.271 --> 01:11:02.654]  They're all controlled by the same multinational corporations.
[01:11:03.114 --> 01:11:03.874]  And they laughed.
[01:11:04.955 --> 01:11:07.837]  And they didn't laugh because it was funny.
[01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:12.200]  They laughed because deep down they knew I was telling the truth.
[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.921]  Well, I mean, let's be fair.
[01:11:13.961 --> 01:11:15.082]  There are a few.
[01:11:15.162 --> 01:11:18.184]  Tom Tancredo, Ron Paul.
[01:11:18.324 --> 01:11:21.245]  Ron Paul said there's a new lady who just got elected in Kansas, a Democrat.
[01:11:21.766 --> 01:11:24.608]  His liberty committee is getting bigger and bigger, what, 20-something members?
[01:11:25.108 --> 01:11:25.468]  And so...
[01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:29.538]  What Ron Paul is doing is popular too.
[01:11:29.598 --> 01:11:30.338]  That's the thing.
[01:11:30.858 --> 01:11:34.281]  The politicians show they're working for multinationals.
[01:11:34.301 --> 01:11:36.562]  30, 40, 50 years ago, even 10 years ago.
[01:11:36.883 --> 01:11:39.905]  If 97% were against something, they didn't do it.
[01:11:40.205 --> 01:11:42.306]  If 90% were against it, they didn't do it.
[01:11:42.586 --> 01:11:44.768]  If 70% were against it, they didn't do it.
[01:11:45.128 --> 01:11:47.690]  Now, for some reason, they don't care.
[01:11:48.422 --> 01:11:57.476]  And now I'm also calling the local talk show hosts and telling them the same thing about the Patriot Act and how it was enacted before 9-11 ever happened.
[01:11:57.536 --> 01:11:58.838]  I mean, not enacted, but written.
[01:11:59.419 --> 01:12:02.183]  And how they pass a newfangled version after 9-11.
[01:12:11.042 --> 01:12:11.963]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:12:12.283 --> 01:12:13.564]  But again, I'm just doing my duty here.
[01:12:13.804 --> 01:12:15.304]  I want my family to live in a free country.
[01:12:15.885 --> 01:12:18.406]  Basically, I got real depressed Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[01:12:18.426 --> 01:12:19.406]  But now I'm back.
[01:12:19.446 --> 01:12:21.527]  I don't feel as bad as I did.
[01:12:22.247 --> 01:12:25.369]  And it's because I knew the Democrats would come in and be horrible whores.
[01:12:26.451 --> 01:12:29.733]  I knew the Democrats would come in and sell out to the lobbyists.
[01:12:30.233 --> 01:12:34.356]  I knew the Democrats would share power and go along to get along.
[01:12:35.316 --> 01:12:37.617]  But I hoped they would call for impeachment.
[01:12:37.818 --> 01:12:40.939]  I hoped they would do the right thing.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.961]  But I should have known they did nothing.
[01:12:45.302 --> 01:12:46.102]  They did nothing.
[01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:50.185]  In fact, they immediately said they were going to join forces.
[01:12:51.286 --> 01:13:01.117]  Look, back in 94, there was a real Republican Revolution, but it was hijacked instantly by Newt Gingrich, who the media then demonized, and conservatives then thought, well, he must be good.
[01:13:01.898 --> 01:13:03.459]  Again, that's good cop, bad cop, folks.
[01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:07.003]  That's please don't throw me in the briar patch, and where does Brer Rabbit want to be thrown?
[01:13:07.043 --> 01:13:07.684]  The briar patch.
[01:13:07.924 --> 01:13:12.285]  You know, the guy catches him, the farmer catches him, and he says, please don't throw me in the briar patch, so he does.
[01:13:12.786 --> 01:13:15.887]  Newt Gingrich comes in, the media attacks him, says, oh, he's right-wing, he's right-wing.
[01:13:16.187 --> 01:13:16.807]  No, he wasn't.
[01:13:16.847 --> 01:13:22.309]  He derailed a giant real crop of congressmen and women that were going to do something.
[01:13:23.029 --> 01:13:30.231]  Just like Ronald Reagan got in and was really going to do something, and boy, he got shot just a few months in office, and everything turned around.
[01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:32.772]  Every historian will tell you, he hated George Bush, Sr.,
[01:13:33.434 --> 01:13:36.697]  He gave speeches about how evil he was and how he wanted one rural government.
[01:13:36.857 --> 01:13:40.720]  We tell you, Ronald Reagan went to that military hospital, and he came out and was never the same.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.281]  He was drugged most of the time.
[01:13:42.542 --> 01:13:44.183]  They'd get him hopped up and roll him out.
[01:13:44.884 --> 01:13:45.644]  It's just horrible.
[01:13:46.285 --> 01:13:47.306]  And it's the same thing.
[01:13:47.366 --> 01:13:48.887]  You know good and well.
[01:13:49.327 --> 01:13:55.793]  Kennedy was the last real president we had, and he didn't tell the line, and they blew his head off in Dallas, Texas, in Dealey Plaza.
[01:13:56.373 --> 01:13:58.635]  Bottom line, and that anniversary is coming up in a few weeks.
[01:13:58.655 --> 01:13:59.816]  43rd Anniversary.
[01:14:01.749 --> 01:14:02.570]  How you doing, Alex Jones?
[01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.730]  Um...
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.501]  Geez, you know, there's so many things going on in this nation.
[01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:35.002]  I just want to say, first of all, a comment.
[01:14:35.682 --> 01:14:36.563]  I'm from New York City.
[01:14:36.903 --> 01:14:38.604]  I was a teenager when 9-11 happened.
[01:14:39.304 --> 01:14:42.386]  And from the bottom of my soul, I thank you for what you're doing.
[01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:45.267]  You're a good American, and I pray for you every day.
[01:14:45.287 --> 01:14:46.888]  And, you know, keep on the good work.
[01:14:46.908 --> 01:14:47.828]  Well, I need those prayers.
[01:14:48.488 --> 01:14:48.849]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:49.009 --> 01:14:49.609]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:49.749 --> 01:14:52.650]  You were telling me, you were saying, you were depressed before with everything going on in the world.
[01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:55.732]  Well, Jesus said, you know, he said, the servant is not great of his master.
[01:14:55.852 --> 01:14:56.652]  Look what they did to him.
[01:14:57.032 --> 01:14:58.213]  The world did the same thing to me and you.
[01:14:59.136 --> 01:15:01.543]  I have a tendency to start a comment and not finish it.
[01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:05.835]  My point was I knew that they were going to do the wrong thing
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:17.129]  And it was like an old nightmare or an old monster coming back into my life because I detested the Democrats and their oiliness and their corruption.
[01:15:17.609 --> 01:15:23.734]  And then, you know, it took me years to fully turn against the Republicans, and now I just see them all working together.
[01:15:23.754 --> 01:15:25.756]  Taylor, I'm going to put you on hold and come back to you, all right?
[01:15:26.216 --> 01:15:26.636]  Yes, sure.
[01:15:27.177 --> 01:15:28.078]  I don't want to cut you short.
[01:15:28.098 --> 01:15:29.259]  You've just got about 30 seconds.
[01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:33.262]  Mike, Keith, Sam, the phones are just totally jammed here.
[01:15:34.105 --> 01:15:37.568]  Well, if you disagree with me, you can call them when you hear a caller hang up at 877-590-5525.
[01:15:37.588 --> 01:15:40.490]  We'll put you ahead of the line.
[01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:41.290]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.711]  Stay with us.
[01:15:52.068 --> 01:15:53.689]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:15:54.009 --> 01:16:01.372]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[01:16:01.552 --> 01:16:09.315]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[01:16:09.535 --> 01:16:10.596]  And there's no odor.

[01:16:35.484 --> 01:16:44.074]  Visit truthandexcellence.com, click the Truth and Excellence banner on GCNlive.com, or call me, Amy Bjorklund, personally, at 805-595-2711.
[01:16:44.094 --> 01:16:44.134]  805-595-2711.
[01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:52.723]  We're good to go.
[01:17:10.418 --> 01:17:11.118]  We're good to go.
[01:17:26.567 --> 01:17:27.167]  We're good to go.
[01:17:45.345 --> 01:17:46.346]  We're good to go.
[01:18:06.598 --> 01:18:07.099]  I think?
[01:18:25.837 --> 01:18:26.237]  That's 800-401-6788.
[01:18:26.257 --> 01:18:26.437]  That's 800-401-6788.
[01:18:51.522 --> 01:18:55.564]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:18:55.784 --> 01:18:59.185]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:18:59.345 --> 01:19:02.787]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:19:03.095 --> 01:19:06.336]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:19:06.356 --> 01:19:11.837]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:19:11.857 --> 01:19:21.499]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:19:21.619 --> 01:19:22.900]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:28.401]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[01:19:28.895 --> 01:19:33.357]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:34.778]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:19:34.958 --> 01:19:38.820]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.700]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:41.141]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:07.162 --> 01:20:09.123]  It's not about right versus left.
[01:20:09.643 --> 01:20:11.765]  It's about right versus wrong.
[01:20:12.465 --> 01:20:14.406]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.106 --> 01:20:22.130]  Call Alex now, toll free, at 877-590-5525.
[01:20:22.891 --> 01:20:27.613]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.494 --> 01:20:32.036]  We've got about 30 minutes of airtime left here.
[01:20:32.096 --> 01:20:35.738]  Before I go back to your calls, I'm going to rush through them now and get to as many people as I can.
[01:20:36.718 --> 01:20:45.446]  If you visit Infowars.com, I have an online video and bookstore, and I'm carrying a film that is not in stores, but it was in theaters all over the country.
[01:20:45.906 --> 01:20:46.867]  It just came out.
[01:20:47.007 --> 01:20:53.313]  It's America, Freedom to Fascism, going over the private nature of the Federal Reserve and the IRS.
[01:20:53.333 --> 01:20:56.216]  That is a governmental collection agency for them.
[01:20:56.276 --> 01:21:01.921]  It gets into the North American Union, the implantable microchip world ID system, and much more.
[01:21:02.762 --> 01:21:02.862]  And...
[01:21:04.126 --> 01:21:08.090]  A CBS News columnist called it the scariest damn film you'll see all year.
[01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:16.277]  You can get it for $19.95 at Infowars.com, and you can get my new film, Terror Storm, when you get America, Freedom to Fascism, for only $9.95.
[01:21:16.337 --> 01:21:24.884]  So if you're online, be sure and get yourselves a copy of America, Freedom to Fascism, and, of course, Terror Storm, right there at Infowars.com.
[01:21:25.084 --> 01:21:29.148]  Or you can buy my new film, Terror Storm, at Amazon.com.
[01:21:29.548 --> 01:21:31.870]  It's been in the top 100 for more than a week now.
[01:21:32.919 --> 01:21:38.061]  And it was in the top ten for a day or so with really almost no promotion.
[01:21:38.101 --> 01:21:39.781]  That is super exciting.
[01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:41.862]  Okay, let's move quickly now.
[01:21:41.882 --> 01:21:43.282]  I'm going to move very quick to your calls.
[01:21:43.322 --> 01:21:46.003]  I want to give Mike a chance to finish up from New York.
[01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:46.683]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:21:47.304 --> 01:21:48.464]  Hey, my name is Mark.
[01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:51.685]  Well, it says Mike, so I'm going to call you Mike.
[01:21:52.045 --> 01:21:52.385]  Who cares?
[01:21:52.465 --> 01:21:53.606]  My question is very simple.
[01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:54.346]  How about Bob?
[01:21:54.366 --> 01:21:54.926]  I'll call you Bob.
[01:21:55.866 --> 01:21:56.406]  It's all right, Bob.
[01:21:56.426 --> 01:21:58.647]  The question is real simple.
[01:21:59.227 --> 01:22:00.588]  I go to college in South Carolina.
[01:22:00.608 --> 01:22:01.268]  I'm from New York.
[01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:14.618]  North and South, I've talked to a lot of people, and the majority of people seem to be moderate, and they seem just to be basically pissed off at the administration, and just voted Democrat because they wanted Bush impeached, they wanted change.
[01:22:14.939 --> 01:22:21.002]  No, exactly, exactly, and the opposite is now happening, showing both sides are controlled!
[01:22:21.402 --> 01:22:22.602]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:22:22.883 --> 01:22:27.465]  My question to you is, what can the average American person do other than just informing people?
[01:22:27.485 --> 01:22:31.527]  I mean, Aaron Russo's got that DVD out, seen it, it's great.
[01:22:31.894 --> 01:22:32.875]  He's got the website.
[01:22:32.895 --> 01:22:36.198]  He's got a website where, you know, you could join and get a good protest.
[01:22:36.238 --> 01:22:37.920]  I mean, he said civil disobedience is the way.
[01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:44.926]  What's the way that the American people could wake up the spirit of 76, get moving, and get with it and bring our Constitution back?
[01:22:44.946 --> 01:22:46.267]  Well, sure, sure.
[01:22:46.307 --> 01:22:47.248]  What was the spirit of 76?
[01:22:47.548 --> 01:22:54.775]  That's when we had the British landing in Lexington and Concord coming in to take the guns.
[01:22:54.815 --> 01:22:56.677]  That's Paul Revere's ride.
[01:22:57.746 --> 01:22:59.167]  And that's going to happen.
[01:22:59.187 --> 01:23:07.774]  The parasites that run our government are going to want more and more and more and more until the American people figure out that both parties are controlled and stand up against it.
[01:23:08.335 --> 01:23:09.556]  And they keep double-teaming us.
[01:23:09.636 --> 01:23:16.662]  In four years, in two years, maybe in eight years, we'll put the Republicans back in to save us, and then that won't happen, so we'll put the Democrats in.
[01:23:17.042 --> 01:23:18.103]  They double-team us.
[01:23:18.143 --> 01:23:18.924]  But here's the good news.
[01:23:20.285 --> 01:23:25.329]  In 1994, with the Republican sweep of the House and the Senate and the governorships,
[01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:35.541]  If you look at the polls, and I've gone and polled them, it was only about 55 to 60 percent, depending on the poll, that agree with Republicans more than they agree with Democrats.
[01:23:36.062 --> 01:23:39.667]  This time there's 84 percent in scientific polls...
[01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:40.590]  So...
[01:24:08.487 --> 01:24:16.434]  The people know the truth, but they still haven't gotten sophisticated enough to know that Nancy Pelosi wasn't going to do a damn thing.
[01:24:17.195 --> 01:24:21.579]  Because, number one, if she really tried to do something, she'd get anthrax mailed to her like Tom Daschle did.
[01:24:21.599 --> 01:24:22.840]  You've got to remember that.
[01:24:23.581 --> 01:24:24.442]  This is serious.
[01:24:24.702 --> 01:24:28.385]  And the establishment is scared.
[01:24:29.406 --> 01:24:32.069]  The impeachment of Bill Clinton was real in...
[01:24:32.756 --> 01:24:35.117]  Yeah, I was wondering why people keep on believing that there wasn't demolition.
[01:24:35.137 --> 01:24:35.837]  I thought I saw a
[01:25:02.938 --> 01:25:04.860]  Well, that's fine if they want to say that.
[01:25:30.414 --> 01:25:32.475]  84.
[01:25:30.494 --> 01:25:32.475]  Again, that number.
[01:25:32.495 --> 01:25:39.158]  84% of Americans in a major CBS News poll, scientific, believe that the government's lying about 9-11.
[01:25:39.258 --> 01:25:43.939]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[01:25:44.319 --> 01:25:44.980]  Mike, welcome.
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:46.720]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:56.484]  I'd like to talk to you a little bit and get your opinion on an angle that I haven't heard yet regarding what Bush has gained by keeping Rumsfeld's removal quiet until after the election.
[01:25:57.233 --> 01:26:09.600]  I was talking to a family member recently and we were discussing the outcome of the election and we both think that it's pretty interesting that Bush didn't reveal that Rumsfeld was leaving when it would have surely helped the Republicans retain a few of their seats.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:12.061]  And we came to the conclusion that
[01:26:13.239 --> 01:26:19.643]  Since the Democrats have announced that they will not impeach Bush, it's pretty much proof that they're working behind the scenes to achieve the same goals.
[01:26:19.663 --> 01:26:20.183]  Well, that's it.
[01:26:20.303 --> 01:26:29.168]  Even Rush Limbaugh, and I have the transcript right here, even Rush Limbaugh said, quote, in a sick way, George Bush is happy the Democrats won.
[01:26:29.348 --> 01:26:31.189]  There's no sick way about it.
[01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:31.810]  That's how...
[01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:33.191]  We're good to go.
[01:26:53.217 --> 01:26:54.338]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[01:26:54.378 --> 01:27:02.126]  I mean, Bush can achieve amnesty for illegals, and he's much closer to enacting the North American Union, which reminds me of Ron Paul.
[01:27:02.607 --> 01:27:07.392]  I was listening to your program a couple of weeks ago when the NRA did that just...
[01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:12.374]  The unexcusable thing that they did to Ron Paul on their website by...
[01:27:32.768 --> 01:27:35.851]  I mean, that, again, the NRA lies about pro-gun congressmen.
[01:27:48.422 --> 01:27:50.143]  Yeah, you know, I talked to the NRA.
[01:27:50.163 --> 01:27:52.563]  I've been a member of the NRA for several years.
[01:27:52.643 --> 01:27:55.544]  My father's a lifetime member, and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
[01:27:55.584 --> 01:28:01.626]  And when we called originally, they refused to comment on it and said, we don't release comments about the way we rate people.
[01:28:01.666 --> 01:28:07.728]  But when we contacted them again, when we were more informed and we asked more direct questions, what we were told is,
[01:28:08.707 --> 01:28:18.795]  That Ron Paul received a lower grade than Sklar because of his failure to vote on a very important piece of gun legislation that went before the House for vote last year.
[01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:26.020]  And by the way, that piece of legislation Ron Paul told me off air, I interviewed him last week, that it was the trigger locks.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:33.005]  The NRA added as a rider to the gun liability law trigger locks, and Ron Paul said no.
[01:28:33.886 --> 01:28:34.326]  That's right.
[01:28:34.787 --> 01:28:36.108]  So for those of you who don't know...
[01:28:36.798 --> 01:28:43.661]  The NRA gave Ron Paul a lower grade for voting against more federal gun control.
[01:28:43.801 --> 01:28:44.941]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:28:44.981 --> 01:28:45.541]  Great call.
[01:28:46.022 --> 01:28:48.022]  And this is the paradigm shift.
[01:28:48.162 --> 01:28:49.843]  It's the elite against the people.
[01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:53.104]  Okay, now somebody 200 years ago knew that in this country.
[01:28:53.324 --> 01:28:55.425]  People in Mexico know it's the elite against the people.
[01:28:55.845 --> 01:29:05.469]  Americans have had it so good for so long because of our forefathers and mothers and veterans before us that we sit here like spoiled brats not knowing what every common sense...
[01:29:05.802 --> 01:29:14.186]  Poor, ignorant, uneducated farmer in Tennessee or in South Texas 200 years ago or 150 years ago would know.
[01:29:14.466 --> 01:29:26.311]  Some tobacco farmer in Virginia 250 years ago, before this country was even a nation, back when it was a colony, knew you don't trust the elite, you keep government small, then elites get together and try to rape you.
[01:29:27.252 --> 01:29:29.713]  But today, oh no, government's good.
[01:29:30.073 --> 01:29:30.793]  I can trust it.
[01:29:30.813 --> 01:29:32.474]  All right.
[01:29:33.553 --> 01:29:35.235]  The phones are just loading the entire broadcast.
[01:29:35.255 --> 01:29:36.937]  I'm going to blitz through your calls when we get back.
[01:29:37.017 --> 01:29:45.125]  I will get into what's happening with the talk of indicting Rumsfeld over in Germany and what the Venezuelans are saying about 9-11.
[01:29:45.145 --> 01:29:46.947]  This is all very important.
[01:29:46.967 --> 01:29:47.848]  It's coming up after the break.
[01:29:48.385 --> 01:29:50.987]  The websites are prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:29:51.007 --> 01:29:52.208]  Don't forget, Jones Report.
[01:29:52.768 --> 01:29:54.390]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:55.290]  What's wrong?
[01:29:55.491 --> 01:29:56.471]  I am so tired.
[01:29:56.551 --> 01:29:59.013]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:29:59.153 --> 01:30:00.234]  I have tried everything.
[01:30:00.314 --> 01:30:02.056]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:30:02.196 --> 01:30:03.357]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:30:03.477 --> 01:30:05.778]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:30:05.939 --> 01:30:07.500]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:09.802]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[01:30:09.902 --> 01:30:12.123]  It's called the Bed Fan Personal Cooling System.
[01:30:12.304 --> 01:30:12.764]  The what?
[01:30:13.084 --> 01:30:15.145]  The BedFan personal cooling system.
[01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:20.526]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.

[01:30:24.128 --> 01:30:25.768]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[01:30:26.128 --> 01:30:30.430]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[01:30:40.114 --> 01:30:43.017]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[01:30:43.257 --> 01:30:44.578]  The bed fan is the answer.

[01:30:51.725 --> 01:30:57.690]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:31:06.448 --> 01:31:06.988]  I think.
[01:31:25.074 --> 01:31:26.415]  The Nationalist Times, PO Box 426, Allison Park, PA 15101.

[01:31:52.097 --> 01:31:56.881]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:31:57.101 --> 01:32:01.084]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:32:01.345 --> 01:32:07.650]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:32:53.769 --> 01:32:55.090]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument.
[01:33:15.017 --> 01:33:15.578]  We're good to go.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.461]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:33:39.521 --> 01:33:40.561]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:41.682]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:16.121]  I'm here every Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:16.382 --> 01:34:16.882]  Central.
[01:34:16.922 --> 01:34:20.364]  I want to thank these stations that have turned us on in Tennessee and Ohio.
[01:34:20.384 --> 01:34:23.486]  A lot of other stations lining it up to turn us on.
[01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:30.491]  And I'm excited for a syndicated show out of NewsRadio 590 KLBJ History here with MS and Genesis Communications.
[01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:33.372]  Let's just continue going to your calls.
[01:34:33.392 --> 01:34:36.294]  I want folks to have a chance to chime in on the election and other issues.
[01:34:36.915 --> 01:34:39.296]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in North Austin.
[01:34:39.316 --> 01:34:39.957]  Thanks for holding.
[01:34:39.997 --> 01:34:40.457]  Welcome, sir.
[01:34:41.092 --> 01:34:42.633]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:34:42.733 --> 01:34:43.474]  Good, sir.
[01:34:43.794 --> 01:34:56.504]  I was going to say that everybody that is listening to your show knows that it's all together and that Pelosi's husband and Bohemian Grove are all bribed and paid off or blackmailed.
[01:34:57.925 --> 01:35:03.350]  But I was going to give a challenge to everyone that if we had 100,000 emails to each of the
[01:35:07.036 --> 01:35:20.020]  No, no, I wholeheartedly agree with you, and we need to do it.
[01:35:20.261 --> 01:35:23.502]  We need to let them know, hey, we put you in here to impeach.
[01:35:23.742 --> 01:35:26.703]  We put you in here to bring these people to justice.
[01:35:27.203 --> 01:35:29.984]  That's why the Republicans were thrown out.
[01:35:30.544 --> 01:35:32.084]  You lied about WMDs.
[01:35:32.124 --> 01:35:33.625]  You abolished the Bill of Rights.
[01:35:34.304 --> 01:35:35.365]  We're good to go.
[01:35:54.764 --> 01:35:59.546]  Two years ago, two and a half years ago, they said they were going to build down the troops.
[01:35:59.606 --> 01:36:02.827]  Well, we're going to pull most of them out, but first we've got to put more in.
[01:36:03.247 --> 01:36:09.750]  There are more troops now in Iraq than there were two and a half years ago, because it is absolute bedlam.
[01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:11.471]  And it's only going to get worse.
[01:36:11.511 --> 01:36:12.371]  It'll be like Vietnam.
[01:36:12.531 --> 01:36:15.412]  They'll be there ten years from now, and, oh, it's too bad that 58,000 or 100,000 died.
[01:36:15.452 --> 01:36:16.433]  That's just the way it is.
[01:36:16.453 --> 01:36:16.613]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:36:20.778 --> 01:36:31.147]  We've got to fight them over there so they don't fight us over here when all the major studies by the Pentagon show it will actually create real terrorists, which is exactly what the globalists want, to actually create a threat.
[01:36:32.048 --> 01:36:34.590]  Let's go ahead and talk to Audrey in Michigan.
[01:36:34.690 --> 01:36:35.411]  Audrey, welcome.
[01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:36.872]  Hi, Alex.
[01:36:37.012 --> 01:36:37.212]  Hi.
[01:36:37.232 --> 01:36:38.373]  How are you doing?
[01:36:38.653 --> 01:36:39.234]  Pretty good.
[01:36:39.673 --> 01:36:40.033]  Good.
[01:36:40.113 --> 01:36:48.135]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know, you know, that I feel a lot of people are waking up and that, you know, you're totally right about... Well, yeah, that's the thing.
[01:36:48.175 --> 01:36:54.676]  Back in 94, when the last revolution, the people trusted one party or trusted the other.
[01:36:54.996 --> 01:36:58.277]  Now the people know they're a pack of liars in scientific polls.
[01:36:58.297 --> 01:36:58.857]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:36:59.277 --> 01:36:59.757]  That's right.
[01:36:59.997 --> 01:37:08.759]  And the unfortunate thing is that, of course, the media manipulation is making the majority to feel like they're in the minority so that they won't take action.
[01:37:09.235 --> 01:37:09.295]  Yes.
[01:37:09.315 --> 01:37:09.395]  Good.
[01:37:21.727 --> 01:37:24.468]  And what are people going to do when that happens?
[01:37:24.528 --> 01:37:25.269]  Well, see, that's the thing.
[01:37:25.329 --> 01:37:38.175]  If Bush was in and there was a convenient terror attack carried out by the Easter Bunny or our own government or maybe that imaginary Al-Qaeda, you know, Durka, Durka, Durka, if that happens, then see, Team America will be a team.
[01:37:38.475 --> 01:37:40.976]  Nancy Pelosi will get up there and she'll be tough.
[01:37:41.036 --> 01:37:47.139]  And, yeah, let's nuke them and let's have a national draft, which the Democrats, Charles Rangel, has been pushing for.
[01:37:47.379 --> 01:37:48.400]  They've got to have one.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:49.760]  Oh, yeah, we're in deep trouble.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.381]  I mean, the nightmare has just begun.
[01:37:52.313 --> 01:38:21.572]  It is, and the things that aren't even being exposed, like the depleted uranium destruction of the earth that's already been ongoing for the last 15 years, we need, I think, to have a massive move and conglomeration of United States citizens concerned to just move en masse on Washington and say, we hired you, this is not what we hired you to do, you're going to do what we tell you,
[01:38:22.313 --> 01:38:24.354]  Or we're not going to do what you tell us.
[01:38:24.574 --> 01:38:25.174]  Exactly.
[01:38:25.714 --> 01:38:27.875]  Look, the government is illegitimate.
[01:38:27.915 --> 01:38:29.375]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[01:38:29.815 --> 01:38:33.576]  When the people put them in there to do something, the vast majority are for it.
[01:38:33.636 --> 01:38:34.716]  It's constitutional.
[01:38:34.997 --> 01:38:35.837]  It's common law.
[01:38:36.017 --> 01:38:37.757]  And they won't.
[01:38:38.297 --> 01:38:39.638]  90% want our borders controlled.
[01:38:39.878 --> 01:38:40.638]  What are they doing?
[01:38:40.718 --> 01:38:42.959]  Getting rid of them.
[01:38:42.979 --> 01:38:46.620]  97% don't want all these new international toll roads to fund the North American Union.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.220]  What do they do?
[01:38:47.799 --> 01:38:48.439]  They do it.
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:50.821]  They don't care because they're tyrants.
[01:38:50.921 --> 01:38:51.481]  What do they do?
[01:38:51.861 --> 01:38:55.403]  Instead of listening to us, they militarize the police to then suppress us.
[01:38:56.264 --> 01:39:00.506]  The Rand Corporation, all of them, admit they're gearing up to oppress the American people.
[01:39:01.246 --> 01:39:04.648]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in North Austin.
[01:39:05.088 --> 01:39:07.330]  Mike, listening on KLBJ 590, go ahead.
[01:39:08.490 --> 01:39:09.671]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:39:09.711 --> 01:39:10.011]  You bet.
[01:39:10.031 --> 01:39:10.872]  I'm sorry I'm having to hurry.
[01:39:10.912 --> 01:39:11.792]  We're just almost out of time.
[01:39:11.952 --> 01:39:12.532]  That's okay, man.
[01:39:12.573 --> 01:39:13.353]  I'll be as fast as I can.
[01:39:14.339 --> 01:39:15.119]  A couple quick things.
[01:39:15.139 --> 01:39:28.063]  I saw the Bev Harris documentary on HBO, and it shows conclusively that anybody with just a good, consistent knowledge of how to program cards on a computer... But it's okay.
[01:39:28.103 --> 01:39:30.644]  The Democrats have gone back to sleep because they let them get in.
[01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:35.565]  Well, if you control a system, you've got to throw it every once in a while to keep people in the game.
[01:39:36.238 --> 01:39:36.558]  Exactly.
[01:39:36.578 --> 01:39:40.999]  You know, even Red Casino has got to let somebody win every once in a while.
[01:39:41.019 --> 01:39:44.040]  Yeah, what people don't know is all the money is house money.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:45.140]  Exactly.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.321]  Yeah, and just one more thing.
[01:39:48.701 --> 01:39:56.643]  I saw Aaron Russo's film when it was in theaters briefly here in Austin, and it literally is one of the most terrifying films I've ever seen.
[01:39:56.683 --> 01:39:59.284]  Well, I've got the DVD available at InfoWars.com.
[01:39:59.304 --> 01:39:59.904]  I hope you'll get it.
[01:40:00.264 --> 01:40:01.244]  Oh, I will, no doubt.
[01:40:01.644 --> 01:40:01.984]  And the...
[01:40:05.049 --> 01:40:12.215]  The caller before mentioned DU and Iraq, and I'm telling you... You know, I could do a whole show on that.
[01:40:12.836 --> 01:40:14.637]  A four and a half billion year half-life.
[01:40:14.918 --> 01:40:18.701]  The Army's own training manuals say it's deadly poisonous and radioactive.
[01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:20.623]  If you breathe it, you will get deadly cancer.
[01:40:21.243 --> 01:40:23.525]  The birth defects are up four times.
[01:40:23.565 --> 01:40:24.766]  It's now like quadrupling.
[01:40:25.287 --> 01:40:29.871]  And the average person, the average troop, even I talk to, goes, well, yeah, but it's a good weapon.
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.721]  Okay, well, great.
[01:40:31.741 --> 01:40:32.701]  It's good at killing you.
[01:40:32.761 --> 01:40:36.504]  It's like Israel uses it on Lebanon, and then it blows right back into Israel.
[01:40:36.544 --> 01:40:42.428]  It's like Hitler got nerve gas by his own nerve gas, his own mustard gas when they were shooting over at the British.
[01:40:43.309 --> 01:40:44.549]  It's craziness.
[01:40:44.670 --> 01:40:46.291]  I mean, I really support the troops.
[01:40:46.631 --> 01:40:50.454]  I don't want them coming back and dying of cancer and having a string of deformed children.
[01:40:50.934 --> 01:40:53.756]  And that's real, folks, quadrupling now.
[01:40:54.036 --> 01:40:57.198]  In Belgrade and Serbia and Iraq, our troops coming home.
[01:40:57.819 --> 01:40:58.859]  Why are they using it?
[01:40:58.899 --> 01:40:59.800]  They don't even need it.
[01:41:00.955 --> 01:41:08.877]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron Listing in Prescott, Arizona.
[01:41:09.377 --> 01:41:10.617]  You're on the air.
[01:41:10.677 --> 01:41:12.058]  I appreciate you calling, sir.
[01:41:12.098 --> 01:41:12.438]  Welcome.
[01:41:13.578 --> 01:41:14.458]  It's Ron.
[01:41:14.918 --> 01:41:15.239]  Okay.
[01:41:15.279 --> 01:41:16.539]  Well, everything's scrambled.
[01:41:16.579 --> 01:41:17.139]  I can't read.
[01:41:17.159 --> 01:41:18.779]  I was public school educated, sir.
[01:41:18.799 --> 01:41:19.940]  No, that's fine.
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.560]  I listen to you three hours a day.
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.601]  I listen to Mike Malloy three hours a day.
[01:41:23.641 --> 01:41:29.262]  And I called his program last Friday and told him that I called you and urged your
[01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:30.614]  No, that's true.
[01:41:30.634 --> 01:41:32.355]  That's true, yeah.
[01:41:56.678 --> 01:42:13.654]  I went through all of that, and I mentioned that the Clintons worked for Daddy Bush, and that he hired them, and Daddy Bush is the star of the Western Hemisphere, and he runs all the drugs in this hemisphere, and the Clintons were helping him.
[01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:16.111]  Smuggle the drugs in through Meno, Arkansas.
[01:42:16.131 --> 01:42:19.413]  I've talked to the CIA, state police, all of them who witnessed it.
[01:42:20.293 --> 01:42:30.639]  And then he said afterwards, after I got done, he says, well, I've heard that stuff, I've seen it all over the Internet, and I've got a friend who believes all that, but I'm not sure whether I believe all that.
[01:42:30.699 --> 01:42:31.239]  Well, I hear you.
[01:42:31.279 --> 01:42:32.120]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.580]  I think Mike's doing a great job.
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:34.341]  I was on his show.
[01:42:35.630 --> 01:42:35.970]  What was it?
[01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:37.071]  Election night.
[01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:43.196]  You can't expect him to be on all those liberal stations and not hold something back.
[01:42:43.597 --> 01:42:45.258]  I do go all the way because I just don't care.
[01:42:46.379 --> 01:42:47.080]  Let's go ahead.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:47.480]  You know what?
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:50.743]  I want to cover these two final news stories, but I want to take these final calls.
[01:42:51.123 --> 01:42:52.084]  They're all loaded right now.
[01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:52.605]  What do I do?
[01:42:53.105 --> 01:42:53.966]  Sam in New York.
[01:42:54.006 --> 01:42:54.586]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:42:54.646 --> 01:42:55.487]  Make it quick, please.
[01:42:55.807 --> 01:42:56.228]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:56.348 --> 01:42:57.549]  Alex, how are you doing, bro?
[01:42:57.609 --> 01:42:57.889]  Fine.
[01:42:57.929 --> 01:42:58.670]  You're a great American.
[01:42:58.690 --> 01:42:59.371]  I'm a big supporter.
[01:42:59.671 --> 01:43:01.352]  I just want to talk about the Electoral College.
[01:43:01.372 --> 01:43:02.073]  Why do you feel that
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:05.182]  That's better for America over the popular vote.
[01:43:05.462 --> 01:43:12.067]  Because it gives you state control so you don't have a federal imperium running everything, just like the 17th Amendment took our senators.
[01:43:12.368 --> 01:43:22.696]  Imagine the power it gave a state and gave you as a state rep or the pressure you can put on a state rep compared to trying to reach the imperial Senate of Rome.
[01:43:22.716 --> 01:43:26.979]  I think it just indulges me on what amendment or bill that's a part of.
[01:43:28.721 --> 01:43:30.322]  It was the 17th Amendment.
[01:43:30.822 --> 01:43:31.663]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:43:32.225 --> 01:43:32.605]  You bet.
[01:43:32.845 --> 01:43:34.706]  Yeah, and the 16th was the income tax.
[01:43:35.406 --> 01:43:39.648]  Okay, folks, they are moving forward in Germany.
[01:43:39.848 --> 01:43:47.692]  They have plaintiffs in the case, who includes 11 Iraqis who are prisoners at Abu Ghraib, charges against Rumsfeld over prison abuse.
[01:43:48.252 --> 01:43:57.016]  You know, remember they sent people to prison from Abu Ghraib who tortured, under orders, the exact White House memos, list of the types of torture they engaged in.
[01:43:57.316 --> 01:43:58.537]  How do you send them to prison?
[01:43:58.577 --> 01:43:59.777]  Or how do you indict Rumi?
[01:44:00.037 --> 01:44:01.558]  Or how do you talk about indicting Rumi?
[01:44:02.057 --> 01:44:05.641]  Instead of actually going after those that gave the orders, is my question.
[01:44:06.201 --> 01:44:06.862]  Here's another one.
[01:44:06.902 --> 01:44:12.147]  This is out of the Miami Herald, where the Venezuelan government is calling on the U.S.
[01:44:12.187 --> 01:44:18.713]  Congress, quote, to demand that the government of President Bush explain the self-inflicted attack on the World Trade Center and its victims.
[01:44:19.614 --> 01:44:25.340]  And it goes on, the supposed aircraft that crashed in the Pentagon and the links between Bin Laden's family and the Bush family.
[01:44:26.471 --> 01:44:33.120]  Both Chavez and his foreign minister, Nicolas Marduro, have referred several times in the past to suspicions about 9-11.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.646]  This is the first time, though, they've gone public saying it's purely self-inflicted.
[01:44:37.666 --> 01:44:39.268]  And our people have been down there talking to them.
[01:44:40.365 --> 01:44:42.007]  All right, we're out of time.
[01:44:42.047 --> 01:44:43.228]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.348 --> 01:44:48.153]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:48.273 --> 01:44:51.156]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:51.296 --> 01:44:55.301]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:55.621 --> 01:45:01.587]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:45:01.807 --> 01:45:03.049]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:13.161 --> 01:45:14.162]  Looking for profit?
[01:45:14.242 --> 01:45:15.623]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:45:15.883 --> 01:45:19.165]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:45:19.225 --> 01:45:26.550]  This low-vintage collector coin, with a total series vintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:30.392]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:45:30.592 --> 01:45:32.113]  Secure your position today.
[01:45:32.133 --> 01:45:33.574]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:33.915]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
