[00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:06.020]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.761]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:09.562]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:11.043]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.783 --> 00:00:12.584]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:17.128]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:21.650]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:31.374]  Alright, today is December the 14th, Thursday, 2006.
[00:00:31.974 --> 00:00:35.816]  And no, this is not Alex Jones, this is Bob Dacey.
[00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:39.676]  Substituting for Alex Jones for the next couple of days.
[00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:42.639]  Alex is out doing something else and I don't even know what he's doing.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.602]  But you're going to have to put up with me for a couple of days.
[00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:53.570]  For those of you who don't know who I am, I have been involved in the fight against the New World Order crowd for about nine years now.
[00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:59.557]  I host a local television talk show in Austin, Texas called The Simple Truth.
[00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:04.345]  We are in our eighth year of operation there.
[00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:10.188]  My producers are my good friends Kelly Taylor and Jeff Kantoff.
[00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:13.710]  We make a great team together because we're all on the same page.
[00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:23.335]  I started this trek or this battle back in 1998 when I met Alex Jones.
[00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:25.276]  He was the guy that actually woke me up.
[00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:27.888]  I'm a conservative Republican type.
[00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:28.950]  You know, that's how I was raised.
[00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.250]  And, uh...
[00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.531]  I was one day sitting at home watching TV.
[00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:45.471]  I was dead tired.
[00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:46.291]  My kids were gone.
[00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:47.211]  My wife was gone.
[00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:53.692]  And I was just channel surfing and up pops this young punk Alex Jones on the local cable TV.
[00:01:54.933 --> 00:02:00.894]  And he was talking about the United Nations taking over the National Park System.
[00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:02.614]  I was like, give me a break.
[00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:04.835]  This guy is totally nuts.
[00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:05.875]  So...
[00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:12.066]  He was rapping and raving about it, and I was just laughing because the guy had a really entertaining delivery style.
[00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:13.386]  You know, really entertaining.
[00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:14.887]  So I thought, well, I'll listen to the guy.
[00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:16.408]  Because it was funny, I thought.
[00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:25.371]  Well, after he got off that topic, he switched to the topic of the Second Amendment and the true meaning of the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:34.474]  Well, in my hardware store here in Austin, Texas, where I have my real job, I own a true value hardware store in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.310]  And I, as a small part of that business, I sell guns.
[00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.331]  So I thought I knew something about the Second Amendment.
[00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:47.473]  So I decided to listen to the crazy man talk about the reason for the Second Amendment.
[00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:55.455]  Problem was that Alex completely, totally, accurately, concisely,
[00:02:57.085 --> 00:03:00.167]  Explained the entire reason for the Second Amendment.
[00:03:00.908 --> 00:03:02.289]  So this put me in a quandary.
[00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.491]  I was thinking, okay, he's 100% right about the Second Amendment.
[00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:09.554]  What's this stuff he's talking about the UN taking over the National Park System?
[00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:13.017]  So I made the mistake of looking it up.
[00:03:13.557 --> 00:03:14.698]  Researching it myself.
[00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.942]  And what I found was that the man was telling the truth about that too.
[00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:21.683]  And it blew me away.
[00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.325]  Kind of a sea change event in my life.
[00:03:26.082 --> 00:03:39.088]  I guess the main confirmation that I had of that event was I was staring at my computer at the website of the Kentucky State Legislature reading a resolution that they had passed in 1997.
[00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:54.795]  I think it was Senate Resolution 35 detailing the United Nations Biodiversity Treaty and their Man in Biosphere program and how they're going along all over the world taking over these pristine areas and administering them
[00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:02.671]  And many of these areas, including many of the national parks, were within their biosphere, so to speak.
[00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:14.074]  And the State Senate of Kentucky had passed a resolution explaining all this, condemning it, and saying that they would not have foreign minions in control of Kentucky land.
[00:04:15.115 --> 00:04:23.697]  So there I was, staring at my computer screen, going, Okay, the crazy man I was watching on TV the other night is telling the truth.
[00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:34.134]  So, I just had to find out what's going on here, because I thought I read the news, I thought I kept up, and I was angry that I didn't know this.
[00:04:35.155 --> 00:04:46.024]  So, when we get back from our first break, I'll get into a little bit more about this, and then we're going to proceed with attacking the United Nations with their own words.
[00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:48.326]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:49.607]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:05:04.182 --> 00:05:07.363]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.703 --> 00:05:09.644]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:17.666]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:25.389]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:28.750]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.451]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:32.671]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.097 --> 00:05:34.758]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:34.778 --> 00:05:38.461]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:45.087]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:08.787]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:09.047 --> 00:06:10.629]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:13.350]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:28.320]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.681]  government.
[00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:30.662]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:31.022 --> 00:06:36.924]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:41.546]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:48.528]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:51.229]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.019]  It's a fact.
[00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.642]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:07:05.982 --> 00:07:11.184]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:14.666]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:22.049]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:29.553]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:07:32.335 --> 00:07:38.659]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:42.682]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[00:07:43.022 --> 00:07:44.483]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[00:07:44.683 --> 00:07:45.604]  Open 9 a.m.
[00:07:45.644 --> 00:07:46.464]  to 5 p.m.
[00:07:46.524 --> 00:07:47.745]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:47.985]  That's 920-293-8024.
[00:07:48.025 --> 00:07:48.686]  And ask for Robert.
[00:07:48.706 --> 00:07:50.367]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:07.456]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:17.540]  Okay, this is Bob Basie, once again substituting for Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:25.984]  I'm back, and I was, uh, before the break, I was talking about how I found out that Alex Jones wasn't a kook, despite his, uh, mannerisms.
[00:08:26.364 --> 00:08:29.465]  So he was, he was, uh, talking about this, um,
[00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:32.412]  United Nations Biosphere Program.
[00:08:32.472 --> 00:08:42.415]  He said they were taking over the National Park System, and sure enough, I looked it up, and gee, the whole state Senate of Kentucky agreed with Alex Jones.
[00:08:43.135 --> 00:08:51.937]  So again, this put me into some sort of a tizzy, because I was a conservative Republican, and I thought I kept up, I read the news, and how come I didn't know about this?
[00:08:53.097 --> 00:08:58.498]  So, I had no idea who this guy was, so I started asking questions, looking around, and
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.042]  Trying to find him again on the local cable access channel.
[00:09:03.463 --> 00:09:13.871]  And then he popped up again and there he was in a videotape standing in front of a United Nations sign in front of one of the national parks.
[00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:20.716]  And he was basically, it was as if he was looking at me saying, hey, you think I'm lying?
[00:09:21.356 --> 00:09:22.497]  Look, here's the sign.
[00:09:23.718 --> 00:09:28.982]  So this got me really, really, really fired up and I found out that
[00:09:30.647 --> 00:09:35.670]  A guy that worked for me part-time in my hardware store was going to University of Texas.
[00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.032]  He was pursuing a degree in radio, television, film production.
[00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:46.315]  Had a part-time job at the radio station where Alex had a Saturday evening show.
[00:09:46.575 --> 00:09:48.216]  It was KJFK here in Austin.
[00:09:49.217 --> 00:09:51.238]  And I was like, you've got to be kidding.
[00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:52.818]  You know who this guy Alex Jones is?
[00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:55.020]  And the fellow said, yeah, I know who he is.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.681]  And I said, well, is this guy for real?
[00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:00.222]  He said, well, he thinks he's for real.
[00:10:00.863 --> 00:10:01.964]  So I said, well, bring him in.
[00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:02.544]  I want to meet him.
[00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:08.709]  And lo and behold, KJFK Radio was only a block away from my hardware store out in Northwest Austin.
[00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.133]  So a few days later, this fellow comes in with Alex Jones in tow.
[00:10:15.594 --> 00:10:20.358]  We go back into my office and spend about three hours back there assessing each other.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.420]  And it was quite a meeting.
[00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:26.663]  By this time, I'd already started doing my own research.
[00:10:27.724 --> 00:10:27.844]  And
[00:10:28.989 --> 00:10:30.229]  About various things.
[00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:37.731]  Among them was, I decided to look in one of my son's senior level government textbooks.
[00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:42.911]  He went to Anderson High School, and actually so did Alex, by the way, here in Austin.
[00:10:43.592 --> 00:10:52.533]  And I decided to see what the government, the school system, was teaching my son about the Constitution.
[00:10:53.313 --> 00:10:57.594]  So I looked in the back of the book where they talked about the Constitution, and they listed the Second Amendment.
[00:10:58.695 --> 00:11:14.285]  Well, gee, the government textbook that they were teaching my son with at Anderson High School back in 1990, I guess it was 1999, 1998, they were teaching him that the Second Amendment doesn't exist.
[00:11:14.885 --> 00:11:16.066]  And they stated it is a fact.
[00:11:16.286 --> 00:11:17.707]  They said it was widely misunderstood.
[00:11:18.667 --> 00:11:22.750]  That it doesn't, it's not about an individual right to keep and bear arms.
[00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:31.170]  So I was shocked that they presented this opinion of theirs as fact, and I gave Alex a copy of the page.
[00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:38.635]  Well, lo and behold, that evening, he was on the radio spreading that all over Austin.
[00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:42.098]  So I thought, gee, media power, you know?
[00:11:43.159 --> 00:11:52.606]  And that was a long time ago, and now here I am sitting in the Central Texas Command Center behind enemy lines doing the Alex Jones Show live to...
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.781]  Oh, how many people?
[00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:55.302]  I don't know.
[00:11:55.342 --> 00:11:57.664]  They say he gets about, what, five million a week?
[00:11:57.704 --> 00:12:00.626]  So I guess I'm going to be talking to two million people in the next couple of days.
[00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:03.409]  So it's funny how things work out.
[00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.172]  Okay, I'm talking about the United Nations.
[00:12:06.532 --> 00:12:11.076]  That gives me the excuse to do something I love to do, is attack the United Nations.
[00:12:11.917 --> 00:12:12.718]  Now, my...
[00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:25.991]  One of the ways I decided to join this battle against globalism, against totalitarianism, against the New World Order crowd, was to join the John Birch Society.
[00:12:26.031 --> 00:12:27.992]  And I am a member of the John Birch Society.
[00:12:28.793 --> 00:12:32.915]  And JBS is an excellent source of information.
[00:12:32.975 --> 00:12:36.658]  As a matter of fact, where do you think Alex got most of his stuff from in the good old days?
[00:12:37.475 --> 00:12:44.837]  John Birch Society was the first organization, actually they were founded in the 50s, in the late 50s, to fight the New World Order.
[00:12:45.517 --> 00:12:47.278]  Specifically, to fight it.
[00:12:48.138 --> 00:12:53.720]  They claimed it was a conspiracy back then, and of course they caught all kinds of flack for it, and they're still catching flack for it.
[00:12:54.639 --> 00:13:04.847]  But I would recommend that you go to their website, www.jbs.org, and take a look at it, because it's been revamped.
[00:13:06.088 --> 00:13:19.559]  They have a news section right there at the front, current news, similar to what whatreallyhappened.com does, and it's quite informative, and if you want, you know, the research they do is impeccable.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.561]  I'm not saying they're perfect, because they're not.
[00:13:22.273 --> 00:13:24.594]  And I'm not saying I agree with everything they do, because I don't.
[00:13:25.094 --> 00:13:35.698]  But it's a fantastic organization, and they are my principal source of information about the United Nations.
[00:13:35.718 --> 00:13:37.479]  I'll give you an example of that.
[00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:41.680]  There's an article posted there right now by John McManus, the president of society.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.902]  South Korean poised to lead United Nations.
[00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:49.823]  All right, so now you've got this organization
[00:13:50.316 --> 00:13:58.098]  Kofi Annan is going to leave here and he's going to have a successor by the name of Ban Ki-moon of South Korea.
[00:13:58.898 --> 00:14:01.298]  And the commentary by McManus reads as follows.
[00:14:02.158 --> 00:14:13.101]  In October, after being selected as the next Secretary General by the 192-member UN General Assembly, Ban Ki-moon thanked the assembled members of the world body.
[00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:18.902]  He said he was honored to be the second Asian to hold a post following U Thant of
[00:14:20.164 --> 00:14:27.669]  Myanmar, if only Burma, who, quote, ably served the world four decades ago, end quote.
[00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:46.300]  In 1970, while serving in the UN top post, Font heaped praise on Soviet dictator and mass murderer Vladimir Lenin, calling him a man of great ideals and claiming that they are, quote, they are in line with the aims of the UN Charter, end quote.
[00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:52.102]  Lenin's ideals led to the death and misery of tens of millions of communism's victims.
[00:14:53.042 --> 00:14:57.245]  Praising thought says a great deal about Ban Ki-moon.
[00:14:58.185 --> 00:15:08.771]  In that same speech, Ban glowingly referred to Kofi Annan, whom he will succeed on January 1st, for having, quote, defined an ambitious agenda, end quote.
[00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:20.128]  In 2000, Anand bared his belief that, quote, state sovereignty is being redefined by the forces of globalization and international cooperation, end quote.
[00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:28.013]  During his 10 years at the UN's helm, Anand made clear that his agenda included attacking national independence.
[00:15:29.894 --> 00:15:34.036]  No stranger to the UN, South Korea's Ban served his country's mission for many years.
[00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:37.098]  He claims to be committed to reform at the organization,
[00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:43.490]  But in praising thought, he displayed his anti-Americanism and his pro-totalitarianism.
[00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.992]  And in saluting Anon, he demonstrated his mindset toward independent nations.
[00:15:49.893 --> 00:15:54.614]  The only course for a sane America is to withdraw from the trap that is the United Nations.
[00:15:54.674 --> 00:15:58.576]  So that's kind of a current situation there at JBS.org.
[00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.091]  But I want to do something.
[00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:09.414]  I'm going to bash the United Nations unmercifully in this first hour, and I'm going to do it with their own documents.
[00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:24.480]  Something I've done many times here locally in Austin, but now I have an opportunity to do it nationally, internationally, on shortwave, AMs, FMs, pirate radio stations, internet broadcast, re-feeds all over the world.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.582]  And so I would be remiss if I didn't take advantage of that opportunity
[00:16:30.393 --> 00:16:33.757]  Now, you can follow along with me if you want to, because I don't make anything up.
[00:16:34.398 --> 00:16:36.380]  I'm kind of a stickler for documentation.
[00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:39.003]  Part of that comes from the way I am.
[00:16:39.344 --> 00:16:42.447]  Part of it comes from the fact that I'm a member of the John Birch Society.
[00:16:43.048 --> 00:16:45.211]  They are also sticklers for documentation.
[00:16:46.232 --> 00:16:49.476]  The best document, in my opinion, the most concise...
[00:16:50.089 --> 00:16:58.813]  An easy to understand document, in my opinion, if you want to attack the United Nations, is the United Nations' own document, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:16:59.613 --> 00:17:00.893]  This document was written in 1948.
[00:17:01.014 --> 00:17:04.895]  It is a founding era document of the UN.
[00:17:05.795 --> 00:17:17.020]  And all you've got to do is go to un.org, click on the English welcome, go up to the top, there's a little gold bar that says Human Rights.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.121]  You click onto that, and then you can
[00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.890]  We're good to go.
[00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.550]  We're good to go.
[00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:52.103]  In the United Nations system.
[00:17:54.785 --> 00:17:55.906]  Let's talk about Article 2.
[00:17:56.466 --> 00:18:02.691]  Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration.
[00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:07.254]  They state in Article 2 that this is what you're entitled to.
[00:18:07.615 --> 00:18:12.878]  So when we go through this, you need to realize that this is what you're entitled to, according to the UN.
[00:18:12.918 --> 00:18:14.179]  This is it, my friends.
[00:18:14.399 --> 00:18:15.100]  This is what you get.
[00:18:16.121 --> 00:18:19.223]  So basically, you're going to find out that you are entitled to be a slave.
[00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:20.184]  Period.
[00:18:20.564 --> 00:18:21.045]  Over and out.
[00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:23.867]  All right, now let's go skip down to Article 4.
[00:18:25.248 --> 00:18:28.069]  No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.
[00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:33.053]  Slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.
[00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:42.439]  You know, it sounds so wonderful, you know, but look at the darling of the UN, Communist China, People's Republic of China.
[00:18:42.619 --> 00:18:46.641]  I mean, no one shall be held in slavery or servitude?
[00:18:47.082 --> 00:18:49.183]  Have you checked the Walmart factories over there?
[00:18:50.554 --> 00:18:52.395]  There's some pretty good documentaries out there.
[00:18:52.896 --> 00:19:01.240]  They stack them like cordwood over there, and they make them work from 7 in the morning to 10 in the evening, seven days a week.
[00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:05.963]  And then they, of course, charge them rent for the apartment that they give them.
[00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:09.305]  And basically, they're just slaves.
[00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:10.185]  Okay?
[00:19:11.386 --> 00:19:12.847]  And what about what?
[00:19:13.693 --> 00:19:14.794]  The slave trade?
[00:19:15.074 --> 00:19:17.595]  I think prostitution is part of the slave trade.
[00:19:18.195 --> 00:19:21.557]  If you follow wherever the U.N.
[00:19:21.597 --> 00:19:26.499]  goes to promote peace and love all over the world with their U.N.
[00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:33.102]  peace forces, you will find that the business that springs up around them is prostitution.
[00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.823]  Forced prostitution.
[00:19:36.763 --> 00:19:42.246]  Yeah, so let's talk about Article 4 and the hypocrisy that is the U.N.
[00:19:43.123 --> 00:19:46.645]  And when we get back once again from the break, we're going to go on to Article 8.
[00:19:46.846 --> 00:19:50.928]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones, Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.629]  Be back in a bit.
[00:20:01.304 --> 00:20:02.445]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:03.106]  It's December 13, 2006.
[00:20:03.866 --> 00:20:07.389]  Golds at $624.90 and 1-ounce gold coins can be purchased for $645.55, $325.33 for half, and $162.67 for quarter-ounce coins at $645.55, $325.33, and $162.67.
[00:20:19.938 --> 00:20:32.981]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:36.362]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:39.882]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:20:39.962 --> 00:20:42.943]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:20:43.223 --> 00:20:46.105]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:49.006]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:49.226 --> 00:20:51.487]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:20:51.627 --> 00:20:54.429]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.689 --> 00:20:58.551]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.878 --> 00:21:05.460]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.000]  are located?
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.601]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:21:09.822 --> 00:21:14.524]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:21:14.804 --> 00:21:19.806]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:21:20.066 --> 00:21:20.646]  We're good to go.
[00:21:39.992 --> 00:21:42.755]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:22:02.008 --> 00:22:02.828]  We're good to go.
[00:22:30.044 --> 00:22:31.565]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:31.585 --> 00:22:32.025]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:36.186]  Just call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:36.506 --> 00:22:36.886]  It's free.
[00:22:36.906 --> 00:22:39.227]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:59.654]  We're good to go.
[00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:35.100]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.902]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:23:38.663 --> 00:23:39.904]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:39.924 --> 00:23:39.964]  702-953-0267.
[00:24:03.832 --> 00:24:09.874]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.474 --> 00:24:13.435]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:17.683 --> 00:24:18.163]  All right.
[00:24:18.243 --> 00:24:20.604]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on GCN.
[00:24:20.624 --> 00:24:23.224]  Again, my name is Bob Basie, substituting for Alex Jones.
[00:24:24.105 --> 00:24:33.927]  And before the break, we were in the process of bashing the United Nations, and I'm going to continue to do so, even though I think it's illegal, as you'll find out.
[00:24:34.027 --> 00:24:37.448]  What I'm doing right now is illegal, according to the United Nations, but I don't care.
[00:24:38.448 --> 00:24:38.868]  Article 8.
[00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:40.168]  Article 8.
[00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:46.290]  Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals.
[00:24:49.066 --> 00:24:58.169]  Okay, Americans listening out there, you have a right to a competent national tribunal.
[00:24:58.249 --> 00:25:08.852]  Well, I could have sworn that Americans have a right to a trial by jury of their peers, not a tribunal, which is about a panel of crooked judges that are politically appointed.
[00:25:09.072 --> 00:25:11.933]  So, again, this should cause you alarm.
[00:25:12.751 --> 00:25:16.093]  United Nations is the engine for global government.
[00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:25.380]  It is the policeman, the tool that the globalists want to use to create this one world government, this one world slave system.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.742]  And here you have it, a red herring here.
[00:25:29.262 --> 00:25:31.944]  You get a tribunal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:34.686]  Okay, let's go to Article 10.
[00:25:36.494 --> 00:25:50.038]  Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.
[00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:52.119]  Once again, it's a restatement.
[00:25:53.171 --> 00:25:56.854]  You get in trouble in the UN system, you get a tribunal.
[00:25:57.454 --> 00:25:59.876]  You do not get the Bill of Rights.
[00:26:00.937 --> 00:26:05.161]  You do not get a trial by jury of your peers.
[00:26:05.821 --> 00:26:07.903]  Now, right there, that should be enough.
[00:26:08.744 --> 00:26:15.569]  This is a direct assault on the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution, and you should know this.
[00:26:15.889 --> 00:26:18.952]  And of course, gee, I never learned this in school, and neither did you.
[00:26:19.432 --> 00:26:20.253]  You ever wonder why?
[00:26:21.574 --> 00:26:22.395]  Okay, let's go down to...
[00:26:23.556 --> 00:26:23.856]  Article 12.
[00:26:26.637 --> 00:26:34.179]  No one shall be subjected to, among other things, attacks upon his honor and reputation.
[00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:40.560]  Well, no one shall be subjected to attacks upon his honor and reputation.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.481]  Well, I got a question.
[00:26:41.561 --> 00:26:45.142]  What if you don't have any honor and your reputation is terrible?
[00:26:46.822 --> 00:26:50.603]  Why are you insulated from being attacked
[00:26:51.235 --> 00:26:53.676]  If you're a dishonorable person with a horrible reputation.
[00:26:54.276 --> 00:26:55.136]  See, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:55.156 --> 00:26:56.997]  That's totally ridiculous.
[00:26:57.277 --> 00:27:01.678]  Of course, the reason they stick that in there is because the crooks that run the UN don't want to be criticized.
[00:27:01.958 --> 00:27:04.519]  Because they don't have any honor and their reputation is horrible.
[00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:12.461]  I mean, that is if you believe in, you know, individual liberty rights, limited government, personal responsibility, things like that.
[00:27:13.722 --> 00:27:16.323]  But these people don't believe in any of that, so they don't want to hear about it.
[00:27:16.503 --> 00:27:20.984]  So, no one shall be subjected to attacks upon their honor and reputation.
[00:27:21.636 --> 00:27:26.839]  I'm telling you right now, Kofi Annan has no honor at all if you believe in freedom.
[00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:27.819]  None at all.
[00:27:27.899 --> 00:27:30.621]  And I'm saying it openly and publicly for the whole world to hear.
[00:27:30.761 --> 00:27:31.601]  It's just the way it is.
[00:27:32.522 --> 00:27:33.662]  I mean, Article 12.
[00:27:34.002 --> 00:27:34.883]  Come on, give me a break.
[00:27:35.163 --> 00:27:37.604]  You can't criticize people's reputation.
[00:27:38.204 --> 00:27:44.988]  That's a human right you have in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, which is what we're discussing right now.
[00:27:46.778 --> 00:27:47.919]  Let's go to Article 13.
[00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:52.883]  Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and return to his country.
[00:27:54.024 --> 00:27:54.704]  Oh, really?
[00:27:56.346 --> 00:28:01.250]  Ask a lot of the people in Communist China whether they can just walk out and leave and come back.
[00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.230]  Come on.
[00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:04.953]  It's total nonsense.
[00:28:06.093 --> 00:28:06.694]  This whole thing
[00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:18.784]  I have described the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an excrement sandwich covered with chocolate frosting.
[00:28:19.685 --> 00:28:26.287]  And it's all sugary and sweet and it sounds real good, but you bite into it, you're going to find out that it's not what you think it is.
[00:28:27.267 --> 00:28:34.149]  You know, you listen to these ridiculous platitudes from the UN and you get all teary-eyed about all your glorious human rights, but when you examine it,
[00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:37.402]  You realize it's nothing but sugar-coated slavery.
[00:28:38.743 --> 00:28:39.143]  Okay.
[00:28:39.683 --> 00:28:43.045]  I'm going to skip Article 14 for right now because I want to come back to it.
[00:28:43.685 --> 00:28:44.485]  Let's go to Article 15.
[00:28:45.706 --> 00:28:47.747]  Everyone has the right to a nationality.
[00:28:50.268 --> 00:28:56.110]  T. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.
[00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:01.032]  The UN says that you cannot be denied the right to change your nationality.
[00:29:01.913 --> 00:29:04.474]  Well, what if nobody wants to make you their nationality?
[00:29:05.283 --> 00:29:05.623]  What then?
[00:29:05.643 --> 00:29:14.689]  I mean, literally, if you took that literally, you'd have about, you know, a billion Chinese people that would just love to switch their nationality to American.
[00:29:15.249 --> 00:29:19.972]  And then they'd all move over here and the Earth's axis would shift with a weight change and screw everything up.
[00:29:20.932 --> 00:29:24.254]  I mean, it's a ridiculous right.
[00:29:24.835 --> 00:29:26.356]  It's total nonsense.
[00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:31.839]  And when we get back from the break, we're going to go into this nonsense even further.
[00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:35.707]  Because it just goes on and on and on, and I've got a few big ones to make.
[00:29:35.727 --> 00:29:37.727]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[00:29:38.227 --> 00:29:50.390]  Be back after the break.
[00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.611]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.071 --> 00:29:54.651]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:58.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.156 --> 00:30:04.478]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:04.738 --> 00:30:06.779]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:13.944]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:14.224 --> 00:30:22.810]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:33:12.937 --> 00:33:17.282]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show on the GCN Communications Radio Network.
[00:33:17.402 --> 00:33:23.989]  Websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:30.736]  Again, we were in the process of bashing the United Nations, and so now I'm going to continue to do so.
[00:33:32.737 --> 00:33:36.459]  I was talking about skipping Article 14 because I've got to come back to it.
[00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:38.279]  I talked about the nationality.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.001]  You know, you have the right to change your nationality in the UN system, whatever that means.
[00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:46.142]  It doesn't mean anything because they don't believe in nationality.
[00:33:46.342 --> 00:33:46.643]  Okay?
[00:33:47.343 --> 00:33:48.383]  They want one world government.
[00:33:48.963 --> 00:33:54.926]  Everybody will be a citizen of the world and we'll all just be happy and we'll all just be slobbering little slaves.
[00:33:56.286 --> 00:33:57.407]  Okay, let's talk about Article 19.
[00:33:59.994 --> 00:34:03.275]  This is their Freedom of the Press article.
[00:34:04.555 --> 00:34:07.175]  Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.
[00:34:07.795 --> 00:34:18.877]  This right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.
[00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:20.158]  That sounds great.
[00:34:20.578 --> 00:34:21.858]  Absolutely sounds great.
[00:34:21.898 --> 00:34:23.218]  But they don't mean any of it.
[00:34:23.358 --> 00:34:25.979]  It's a big, fat, bald-faced lie.
[00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:27.559]  Give you an example.
[00:34:28.103 --> 00:34:30.866]  A couple of years ago, remember the SARS epidemic?
[00:34:31.026 --> 00:34:33.828]  Where the big disease SARS was going to come and kill us all?
[00:34:33.848 --> 00:34:34.509]  Remember that?
[00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.953]  Okay, so they had a SARS conference at the UN building and
[00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.202]  Well, gee, the United Nations Press Corps was sponsoring this thing.
[00:34:43.242 --> 00:34:47.105]  This is press correspondents from the UN.
[00:34:47.565 --> 00:34:49.527]  Their own press corps.
[00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:50.027]  Got it?
[00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:58.454]  Okay, so they're sponsoring the SARS conference so they can come discuss ideas about how to save us from this global scourge, right?
[00:34:59.235 --> 00:35:03.718]  Okay, well, the UN Press Corps invited someone from Taiwan to show up.
[00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:06.120]  You know, some doctor or whatever.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.180]  So...
[00:35:07.682 --> 00:35:08.882]  You know, because they have concerns.
[00:35:08.922 --> 00:35:11.083]  It was an Asian thing, and Taiwan's over there.
[00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:21.886]  Well, Kofi Annan told the fellow from Taiwan that he, under no circumstances, was going to be allowed on the UN property.
[00:35:22.967 --> 00:35:25.408]  Well, the UN press corps just pitched a fit.
[00:35:28.128 --> 00:35:31.309]  But, sir, what about Article 19?
[00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:33.190]  This was at a press conference, by the way.
[00:35:33.914 --> 00:35:39.936]  Kofi Annan talking to a member of the United Nations Correspondents Association.
[00:35:40.416 --> 00:35:46.378]  And the correspondent asks his eminence, Mr. Annan, But sir, what about Article 19?
[00:35:46.418 --> 00:35:53.281]  Don't you respect the freedom of the press, which is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?
[00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:56.302]  And Kofi Annan looked him square in the face and said,
[00:35:57.683 --> 00:36:05.285]  Ah, yes, we like Article 19, but you must respect our principles, and one of them is that there is only one China.
[00:36:07.346 --> 00:36:15.308]  You know, so right there, right there, the United Nations praised Article 19 as a bunch of garbage, because they cancelled it.
[00:36:15.728 --> 00:36:20.909]  And I'm going to explain why they were not inconsistent in so doing.
[00:36:22.657 --> 00:36:28.602]  So, Article 19, you're only allowed to have your freedom of expression and opinion if the U.N.
[00:36:28.983 --> 00:36:30.424]  agrees with it, basically.
[00:36:31.625 --> 00:36:32.045]  Okay.
[00:36:32.065 --> 00:36:34.107]  Let's go to Article 21.
[00:36:34.327 --> 00:36:37.370]  Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in this country.
[00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:38.411]  You hear that?
[00:36:39.132 --> 00:36:41.974]  You have the right to public service in your country.
[00:36:42.174 --> 00:36:42.515]  That's right.
[00:36:42.535 --> 00:36:46.118]  You have the right to serve the state rather than the other way around.
[00:36:46.178 --> 00:36:47.059]  Just keep that in mind.
[00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:48.079]  In the U.N.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:48.440]  system,
[00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:51.680]  You have the right to serve the state.
[00:36:52.961 --> 00:36:53.641]  Okay, Article 24.
[00:36:53.681 --> 00:36:56.302]  This is an interesting article.
[00:36:56.322 --> 00:36:57.202]  This is a big joke.
[00:36:57.943 --> 00:37:05.266]  Everyone has the right, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay.
[00:37:05.366 --> 00:37:07.246]  Everyone has the right to holidays with pay.
[00:37:08.487 --> 00:37:08.627]  Huh.
[00:37:09.387 --> 00:37:15.950]  We ought to talk to those people in China at the Walmart factory where they're working from 7 in the morning to 10 in the evening, 7 days a week.
[00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.610]  I wonder whether they get holidays with pay.
[00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.811]  I ought to ask them.
[00:37:19.838 --> 00:37:37.511]  And of course, if they were able to tell you, probably the next thing that happened to them is they'd find themselves as an involuntary body part donor in the communist Chinese system of selling body parts of prisoners for profit, which has been in all the news, and the Chinese now even admit that they do it.
[00:37:38.271 --> 00:37:41.213]  But their excuse is, well, we only take the body parts of prisoners?
[00:37:41.814 --> 00:37:41.994]  Ha!
[00:37:42.334 --> 00:37:42.834]  Come on!
[00:37:42.854 --> 00:37:45.997]  You see how disgusting this whole thing is?
[00:37:46.937 --> 00:37:47.878]  Absolutely vile.
[00:37:49.108 --> 00:37:49.729]  Okay, Article 26.
[00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:51.210]  Article 26.
[00:37:52.671 --> 00:37:54.112]  Everyone has the right to education.
[00:37:55.213 --> 00:38:01.558]  Education shall... further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.
[00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:04.560]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:13.267]  In the UN system, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, you have a right to be educated with propaganda...
[00:38:13.772 --> 00:38:15.573]  That promotes the United Nations system.
[00:38:15.933 --> 00:38:16.314]  There you go.
[00:38:16.574 --> 00:38:17.014]  It's right there.
[00:38:17.214 --> 00:38:17.654]  Article 26.
[00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.155]  Isn't it lovely?
[00:38:20.136 --> 00:38:28.881]  Now, Article 28, nobody ever talks about Article 28, but it actually says that you are entitled to a new world order.
[00:38:28.901 --> 00:38:32.203]  It doesn't use those words, but it says it.
[00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:41.169]  Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in
[00:38:44.482 --> 00:38:45.002]  There you have it.
[00:38:46.062 --> 00:38:51.324]  According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, you have a right to the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:52.484 --> 00:38:57.606]  And when you get your New World Order, all the garbage in this document can be fully realized.
[00:38:58.326 --> 00:38:59.286]  Don't you feel special now?
[00:39:00.127 --> 00:39:02.547]  You have a right to be a slave.
[00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:06.208]  Okay, now we're getting close to the end of this thing.
[00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:07.249]  We have Article 29.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.681]  One of my favorite articles, Article 29, Section 1.
[00:39:13.042 --> 00:39:19.326]  Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.
[00:39:20.527 --> 00:39:27.371]  So you once again, Article 29 says you as a human being have a duty to serve the state.
[00:39:29.012 --> 00:39:31.414]  You are like a little ant in an ant mound.
[00:39:31.434 --> 00:39:34.015]  You have a duty to serve the state.
[00:39:34.636 --> 00:39:36.897]  Otherwise you can't fully develop your personality.
[00:39:38.815 --> 00:39:40.256]  Okay, Article 29, Section 2.
[00:39:41.676 --> 00:39:48.480]  In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.061]  Dot, dot, dot.
[00:39:51.081 --> 00:39:59.485]  So, in the UN system, your rights and your freedoms can be limited if somebody decides to pass a law against them.
[00:40:00.085 --> 00:40:00.225]  Hmm.
[00:40:00.846 --> 00:40:01.246]  Interesting.
[00:40:02.407 --> 00:40:06.769]  In our system, in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, our rights are inalienable.
[00:40:07.289 --> 00:40:07.389]  Hmm.
[00:40:08.078 --> 00:40:11.139]  And the UN system, well, just pass a law against them and they go away.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.280]  But I'm sure they'll have a good reason.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.341]  Of course they will.
[00:40:15.001 --> 00:40:15.701]  They always do.
[00:40:17.042 --> 00:40:18.463]  Okay, Article 29, Section 3.
[00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:19.863]  This is one of the big ones.
[00:40:19.883 --> 00:40:23.045]  This is at the very end of the document.
[00:40:23.065 --> 00:40:24.145]  There's only one article left.
[00:40:26.386 --> 00:40:27.166]  And what does this say?
[00:40:28.687 --> 00:40:29.748]  Article 29, Section 3.
[00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:37.591]  These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[00:40:39.249 --> 00:40:40.629]  Okay, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.791]  1948, founding era document of the United Nations.
[00:40:44.871 --> 00:41:02.656]  They finally state that all these so-called rights that they give you in the first articles of this thing, Article 1 through 28, all these glorious human rights you have, you may in no case, that means, no case means no case.
[00:41:02.716 --> 00:41:03.696]  That means forget it.
[00:41:05.517 --> 00:41:09.058]  These freedoms in no case may be exercised if you disagree with the U.N.
[00:41:10.922 --> 00:41:12.023]  Now, think about that.
[00:41:13.203 --> 00:41:16.865]  All of your rights are conditional upon UN approval.
[00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:35.076]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is why when Kofi Annan told the UN press correspondent that he couldn't bring a representative from Taiwan to the SARS conference a couple of years ago, Kofi Annan was not inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:41:35.956 --> 00:41:36.937]  The correspondent said,
[00:41:37.532 --> 00:41:44.137]  Invoked Article 19, this freedom of the press and expression and information.
[00:41:45.198 --> 00:41:58.008]  Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, trumped it with Article 29, Section 3, when he said, You must understand our principles, and one of our principles is there is only one China.
[00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.330]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:00.959 --> 00:42:04.982]  Article 29, Section 3 trumped Article 19.
[00:42:05.302 --> 00:42:06.403]  It trumps them all.
[00:42:07.523 --> 00:42:10.425]  If you disagree with the U.N., you have no human rights.
[00:42:11.666 --> 00:42:12.787]  Now, I'm not saying this.
[00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:14.188]  They're saying it.
[00:42:15.008 --> 00:42:20.292]  And they've been saying it since the inception of this demonic organization.
[00:42:21.032 --> 00:42:21.333]  All right?
[00:42:22.353 --> 00:42:25.415]  Now, let's go to Article 30, the last one.
[00:42:25.455 --> 00:42:26.176]  The last one.
[00:42:27.677 --> 00:42:29.298]  This is kind of a punctuation here.
[00:42:29.738 --> 00:42:30.779]  Kind of an exclamation.
[00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:47.835]  Nothing in this declaration may be interpreted as implying for any state, group, or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein.
[00:42:49.676 --> 00:42:58.799]  So here you have, in Article 30, the last article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, you have it stated very clearly that you
[00:43:00.985 --> 00:43:08.950]  I mean, think about that.
[00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:20.878]  And actually, the reason I wanted to go back to Article 14 last is because Article 14 is an enforcement clause.
[00:43:22.359 --> 00:43:23.039]  Let me just read it.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.201]  First part of it sounds pretty good.
[00:43:26.582 --> 00:43:27.282]  Article 14, Section 1.
[00:43:29.528 --> 00:43:33.891]  Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
[00:43:35.192 --> 00:43:36.133]  Okay, that's pretty cool.
[00:43:37.034 --> 00:43:46.181]  You know, let's say you're living in Cuba in the early 60s and, you know, you were a lower level member of the government and Castro's overthrown it and he's out to kill you.
[00:43:46.201 --> 00:43:50.884]  And so you run over to the United States and say, I want political asylum.
[00:43:50.944 --> 00:43:51.925]  And they say, okay, great.
[00:43:52.626 --> 00:43:53.286]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:43:54.727 --> 00:43:58.390]  Everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
[00:43:59.284 --> 00:44:00.204]  I got no problem with that at all.
[00:44:00.224 --> 00:44:02.906]  The problem is Article 14, Section 2.
[00:44:06.087 --> 00:44:16.891]  This right may not be invoked in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or from acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[00:44:18.912 --> 00:44:26.095]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, this right may not be invoked from acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[00:44:26.956 --> 00:44:27.636]  So once again,
[00:44:28.629 --> 00:44:37.911]  What they say, in their own language, in their own words, is if the United Nations wants to persecute you, you have nowhere to hide.
[00:44:37.931 --> 00:44:41.832]  So, it's an enforcement law.
[00:44:43.332 --> 00:44:45.213]  So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:46.553 --> 00:44:54.255]  This is why I decided to launch this attack on the United Nations on the Alex Jones Show here today.
[00:44:55.355 --> 00:44:55.855]  It's because...
[00:44:57.011 --> 00:44:59.052]  They hang themselves with their own words.
[00:45:00.292 --> 00:45:10.356]  And if you've never heard any of this stuff, if you're new to this topic, ask yourself why you were never taught this in school.
[00:45:11.837 --> 00:45:12.437]  I never was.
[00:45:13.977 --> 00:45:14.558]  I never was.
[00:45:15.358 --> 00:45:17.779]  I was a little kid in the 60s growing up, you know.
[00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:23.381]  And all I ever knew about the United Nations back then was
[00:45:24.192 --> 00:45:29.441]  Well, gee, every Halloween they would give us a little orange box and tell us to go trick-or-treat for UNICEF.
[00:45:30.543 --> 00:45:31.264]  You know, and I did it.
[00:45:32.386 --> 00:45:34.109]  Wandering around the neighborhood like a little
[00:45:35.643 --> 00:45:57.649]  A little dupe wanting coins for UNICEF, and I didn't know at the time that that was during the Vietnam War, and gee, it turned out that my money, little Bobby Dacey, collected back in the 60s going from house to house saying trick-or-treat, some of it was sent to North Vietnam during the 60s while the North Vietnamese were killing American troops.
[00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.910]  Gee, if I'd have only known that at the time.
[00:46:02.331 --> 00:46:03.771]  Oh, well, such is life.
[00:46:05.365 --> 00:46:05.725]  Alright.
[00:46:06.085 --> 00:46:08.546]  Let me tell you a little bit about what we're going to be doing for the rest of the show.
[00:46:09.887 --> 00:46:19.471]  In the next segment, after the break, I'm going to be releasing a new story that I have posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:46:19.511 --> 00:46:20.431]  It's up there right now.
[00:46:20.451 --> 00:46:22.152]  It's called Treason 101.
[00:46:22.912 --> 00:46:26.714]  And it is an InfoWars exclusive.
[00:46:26.794 --> 00:46:28.275]  It's a Simple Truth exclusive.
[00:46:28.295 --> 00:46:29.075]  That's the name of my
[00:46:35.178 --> 00:46:45.570]  I'm going to let you know what I've come up with in regard to this new breaking story, and it has to do with the North American Union.
[00:46:46.451 --> 00:46:50.736]  And I guess you might even call it treason on our shores.
[00:46:51.627 --> 00:46:52.889]  As a matter of fact, that's what it is.
[00:46:52.969 --> 00:46:54.130]  It's treason on our shores.
[00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:57.895]  The article is called Treason 101.
[00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:02.700]  Arizona State University Promotes the Destruction of the United States of America.
[00:47:03.521 --> 00:47:06.345]  So when we get back from this break, we're going to talk about that.
[00:47:06.965 --> 00:47:09.929]  Then we're going to get into the North American Union some more.
[00:47:10.731 --> 00:47:17.135]  This is one of the most important things that you need to understand and that you need to do something about.
[00:47:18.336 --> 00:47:28.904]  You know, the United Nations is the big dog, but the bottom line is they're trying to go to global government through a regional government process.
[00:47:29.584 --> 00:47:31.606]  That's what the European Union is about.
[00:47:32.586 --> 00:47:36.129]  That's what the FTAA, they were trying that, is about.
[00:47:36.149 --> 00:47:39.531]  Free Trade Area of the Americas, they were trying to merge the entire Western Hemisphere together.
[00:47:40.168 --> 00:47:41.329]  into one big happy country.
[00:47:42.769 --> 00:47:44.470]  But they ran into all kinds of problems with that.
[00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:50.714]  One locally here in the United States, John Burke Society, was instrumental in helping to stop that.
[00:47:51.434 --> 00:48:00.959]  However, well, when they found out that they couldn't get it on in one big gulp, they decided, well, we're just going to take three countries at a time.
[00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:07.863]  And, of course, the three countries they picked were the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
[00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:28.155]  And if you're new to this, if you're new to the Alex Jones Show, if you don't know what's going on, you better get up to speed pretty quick on the North American Union, because this is no theory, this is no conspiracy theory, this is no wild-eyed academic exercise by a bunch of kooky professors.
[00:48:28.895 --> 00:48:31.816]  They're doing this right now.
[00:48:32.596 --> 00:48:35.477]  And what's disgusting about it, among other things, is that
[00:48:36.013 --> 00:48:39.736]  They're completely bypassing the United States Congress.
[00:48:40.597 --> 00:48:46.061]  The process of merging the United States, Canada, and Mexico is not allowed in the Constitution.
[00:48:47.182 --> 00:48:47.963]  It's just not there.
[00:48:48.603 --> 00:48:54.548]  You cannot destroy the country by merging it with two other countries and turning it into some other entity.
[00:48:55.169 --> 00:48:56.049]  That's not allowed.
[00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:05.517]  If it were to be allowed, it would have to be done through constitutional amendment, legislative process,
[00:49:06.485 --> 00:49:07.185]  Or things like that.
[00:49:08.006 --> 00:49:22.612]  But the globalists that run the administration here in the United States have decided, well, we realize that the Congress probably wouldn't want to go along with destroying the United States of America, so we're just going to go around them.
[00:49:22.632 --> 00:49:34.478]  We're going to do an in-run around the Constitution, an in-run around that legislative protection that was built into the Constitution, this separation of powers thing,
[00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.691]  They just decide to do it anyway, you know?
[00:49:38.371 --> 00:49:42.472]  And the pathetic thing about it is they're doing it right now.
[00:49:43.032 --> 00:49:54.654]  And in the top of the next hour, we're going to have Jerome Corsi, a seasoned journalist from Human Events magazine, which is an old, old, old, well-respected conservative magazine.
[00:49:55.335 --> 00:49:58.415]  He's scheduled to come on and talk about this stuff with us.
[00:49:59.215 --> 00:50:01.436]  So he's going to be on in the next segment.
[00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:05.626]  And we're going to kick around this North American community.
[00:50:06.326 --> 00:50:14.789]  But before we do that, I am going to go through an article that I have written called Treason 101.
[00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:24.272]  And it's kind of interesting because it's just an example of how in-depth this treason has become.
[00:50:24.572 --> 00:50:26.973]  It is absolutely obscene.
[00:50:28.579 --> 00:50:36.622]  And this is something I discovered through some of my sources, and it turns out I just kicked a rock and out came another cockroach.
[00:50:37.642 --> 00:50:41.464]  So when we get back from this break, we're going to talk about Treason 101.
[00:50:41.784 --> 00:50:45.785]  Arizona State University promotes the destruction of the United States of America.
[00:50:46.646 --> 00:50:47.106]  Back with you.
[00:50:58.544 --> 00:51:07.728]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.068 --> 00:51:09.969]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.369 --> 00:51:17.992]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.689 --> 00:51:25.776]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.156 --> 00:51:29.079]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.802]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.043]  NSA spies.

[00:52:01.152 --> 00:52:09.416]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.656 --> 00:52:14.018]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.318 --> 00:52:23.222]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.442 --> 00:52:27.064]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.304 --> 00:52:28.005]  We're good to go.
[00:52:28.025 --> 00:52:28.465]  We're good to go.
[00:52:39.887 --> 00:52:40.548]  What about you?

[00:54:13.181 --> 00:54:14.281]  Okay.
[00:54:14.321 --> 00:54:16.342]  This is Bob Basie for Alex Jones.
[00:54:16.382 --> 00:54:17.142]  We're back again.
[00:54:17.162 --> 00:54:22.103]  Today is December the 14th, 2006.
[00:54:22.263 --> 00:54:25.164]  And I'm covering for Alex today and tomorrow.
[00:54:26.744 --> 00:54:29.925]  And let's get to this story I was going to tell you about that I wrote.
[00:54:29.945 --> 00:54:32.405]  It's posted on Infowars.com right now.
[00:54:32.465 --> 00:54:33.626]  I believe it is anyway.
[00:54:34.486 --> 00:54:35.406]  It's called Treason 101.
[00:54:35.886 --> 00:54:40.267]  Arizona State University Promotes the Destruction of the United States of America.
[00:54:41.178 --> 00:54:42.558]  Now, what is this about?
[00:54:42.618 --> 00:55:04.365]  Well, you see, in the document, Building a North American Community, the Council on Foreign Relations document, written by the CFR Task Force, Report of the Independent Task Force on the Future of North America, they state very clearly that part of the way to merge Canada, the United States, and Mexico into one country is
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:12.942]  Is to propagandize the intelligentsia in the country, get the professors behind it, get them to teach their students how wonderful it is.
[00:55:13.582 --> 00:55:17.243]  So let me just read from this article I wrote.
[00:55:17.983 --> 00:55:23.284]  Treason 101, Arizona State University promotes the destruction of the United States of America.
[00:55:25.485 --> 00:55:30.466]  In May of 2005, a Council on Foreign Relations CFR task force released, quote,
[00:55:31.221 --> 00:55:38.864]  Building a North American community and quote a blueprint for merging the United States, Mexico, and Canada into one country called North America.
[00:55:40.024 --> 00:55:50.728]  The plan, which is being implemented via the Security and Prosperity Partnership Agreement signed last year between the leaders of the three countries, will destroy the sovereignty of the USA.
[00:55:51.909 --> 00:55:54.650]  The United States will cease to exist as an independent nation
[00:55:55.714 --> 00:56:00.936]  The United States Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, will be extinct.
[00:56:02.037 --> 00:56:06.439]  Implementation of such a plan is therefore, by definition, an act of treason.
[00:56:07.759 --> 00:56:10.120]  No other word fits this crime.
[00:56:11.761 --> 00:56:15.762]  Critical to the execution of this high crime is the careful application of propaganda.
[00:56:16.503 --> 00:56:24.206]  To that end, the academic community within the United States is being enlisted to sell the idea that destroying America is a good idea.
[00:56:25.566 --> 00:56:34.793]  On page 29 of Building a North American Community is a recommendation to quote, develop a network of centers for North American studies.
[00:56:35.974 --> 00:56:47.483]  We recommend that the three governments open a competition and provide grants to universities in each of the three countries to promote courses, education, and research on North America.
[00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:48.484]  End quote.
[00:56:50.717 --> 00:56:59.104]  Arizona State University is one of the first academic judices to volunteer to sell out American sovereignty.
[00:57:00.225 --> 00:57:03.868]  Traders at the Arizona State University have put up a website.
[00:57:04.673 --> 00:57:17.998]  That's www.asu.edu slash CLAS slash NACTS slash BNA Let me repeat that for you if you want to write it down.
[00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:30.463]  www.asu.edu slash CLAS slash NACTS slash BNA
[00:57:32.997 --> 00:57:35.859]  You can go on Alex's site, and I think there's a link there.
[00:57:35.899 --> 00:57:37.360]  You can click right to what I'm talking about.
[00:57:38.381 --> 00:57:45.826]  This is intended to be an instructional tool to assist and encourage professors to teach the concept of North America to their unwitting student body.
[00:57:46.747 --> 00:58:00.918]  The site, appropriately titled Building North America, was created in cooperation with the North American Center for Transborder Studies at ASU, which must therefore be the actual nest of traders residing at ASU.
[00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:18.159]  Now, if you go to this website, they break it down into several categories, several topics, and they have an About Us-Who Are We page of the website, and it lists the America Society Council of the Americas as a partner.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:26.324]  So they make no attempt to hide the fact that David Rockefeller and his co-conspirators at the CFR are behind all this.
[00:58:27.535 --> 00:58:35.098]  So, when we get back, we'll blast David Rockefeller and this treacherous, treasonous activity at ASU.
[00:58:36.718 --> 00:58:39.859]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:39.919 --> 00:58:40.540]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:56.494 --> 00:58:57.134]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.795 --> 00:58:58.875]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.575 --> 00:59:00.716]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.336 --> 00:59:02.176]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.897 --> 00:59:03.777]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.797 --> 00:59:08.179]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.659 --> 00:59:12.741]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.044 --> 00:59:24.446]  Alright, welcome back to the second hour of the Alex Jones Show on the GCN Communications Radio Network.
[00:59:25.146 --> 00:59:28.707]  I am Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones today and tomorrow.
[00:59:29.807 --> 00:59:41.550]  And if you've been listening the first hour of this show, I've been unmercifully bashing the United Nations, and now I'm switching to Arizona State University and covering an article I've posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:59:42.791 --> 00:59:47.332]  They're teaching their students to love the concept of destroying the United States of America.
[00:59:48.302 --> 01:00:00.230]  I was talking about the America Society and Council of the Americas as a partner on the Arizona State University website where they promote the merger of the three countries into one.
[01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:05.053]  They call it economic integration, but that's always just one step to the whole enchilada.
[01:00:06.294 --> 01:00:14.499]  I want to remind you that David Rockefeller, Chairman Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, has his hands in all of this.
[01:00:15.214 --> 01:00:16.335]  And he's proud of it.
[01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:17.535]  He thinks it's a great idea.
[01:00:17.555 --> 01:00:18.396]  I mean, he really does.
[01:00:19.036 --> 01:00:22.018]  He thinks that treason selling out your country is actually a good thing.
[01:00:22.738 --> 01:00:24.259]  And if you don't believe me, believe him.
[01:00:24.279 --> 01:00:29.521]  I just have to quote Mr. Rockefeller in his book Memoirs, which he published in 2002.
[01:00:29.722 --> 01:00:32.303]  You have to check out page 405.
[01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:37.285]  It's in a chapter called Proud Internationalists.
[01:00:38.346 --> 01:00:40.227]  He says this, quote,
[01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:58.477]  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure.
[01:00:59.797 --> 01:01:01.538]  One world, if you will.
[01:01:02.479 --> 01:01:05.100]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty.
[01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:06.761]  And I'm proud of it.
[01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:08.422]  End quote.
[01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:13.791]  So you have David Rockefeller and his Council on Foreign Relations behind all of this stuff.
[01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:14.551]  It's obvious.
[01:01:14.731 --> 01:01:18.453]  It's right out there in plain sight on the Arizona University website.
[01:01:20.374 --> 01:01:26.417]  And then they talk about all the various sections of how they're going to get this done.
[01:01:26.457 --> 01:01:29.458]  They break the website into various components.
[01:01:30.059 --> 01:01:32.980]  One of them is organizations and university-based centers.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.501]  And they list some of the universities.
[01:01:35.921 --> 01:01:37.522]  You know, originally when I wrote the story,
[01:01:38.516 --> 01:01:41.897]  It's kind of like, again, it's like kicking rocks and you find roaches.
[01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:47.358]  And this rock got kicked, and this roach popped out, and it was Arizona State University.
[01:01:48.358 --> 01:01:53.560]  And so I thought, well, this is the first university that's actually teaching this.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:02:02.742]  And then I sent the copy of the story to my producer, Kelly Taylor, and she said, no, Bob, I kicked up another rock, and they're not the first.
[01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:03.682]  They're just one of them.
[01:02:04.782 --> 01:02:07.103]  Turns out that there's another...
[01:02:07.939 --> 01:02:11.220]  A nest of these people that's been at this a long, long time.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.921]  Actually, since 1998.
[01:02:14.821 --> 01:02:17.962]  Pace University has been involved in this.
[01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:21.924]  Their School of Business in New York has been involved in this.
[01:02:22.984 --> 01:02:24.125]  Duluth University.
[01:02:24.165 --> 01:02:25.385]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:02:25.465 --> 01:02:27.666]  Duluth University in Nova Scotia.
[01:02:28.826 --> 01:02:33.348]  And there's a university called HEC in Montreal.
[01:02:33.548 --> 01:02:34.148]  And also...
[01:02:34.901 --> 01:02:44.986]  There's an EGADE Institute Technological de Estudio Superiorist in Monterrey, Mexico that's been involved in this since about 1998.
[01:02:45.246 --> 01:02:56.271]  They're members of the Pan American Partnership for Business Training, and this whole thing is run by yet another cockroach that we've found out about for the name of Stephen Blank.
[01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:05.032]  Stephen Blank is a professor of international business and management at Pace University's Lubin School of Business.
[01:03:05.992 --> 01:03:09.673]  And listen to this guy's resume.
[01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:14.654]  74 to 75, an international affairs fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:03:14.694 --> 01:03:15.554]  We'll go figure.
[01:03:16.535 --> 01:03:21.916]  And it says he's served as a visiting fellow with the Royal Institute of International Affairs of London.
[01:03:23.414 --> 01:03:31.860]  And he was a scholar and resident at the Rockefeller Foundation's Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio, Italy in 1976.
[01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:33.962]  My goodness.
[01:03:34.923 --> 01:03:35.203]  Gee.
[01:03:35.643 --> 01:03:36.264]  It never ends.
[01:03:37.304 --> 01:03:37.725]  All right.
[01:03:37.765 --> 01:03:42.928]  When we get back from the break, we're going to have Jerome Corsi come up, and we'll discuss all this with him.
[01:03:42.948 --> 01:03:47.372]  Bob Desney for Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:58.491]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:58.852 --> 01:04:00.752]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.152 --> 01:04:08.816]  Shockingly classified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.476 --> 01:04:16.539]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.939 --> 01:04:19.880]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.561]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:23.002 --> 01:04:23.882]  NSA spies.

[01:05:53.536 --> 01:05:58.977]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:05:59.398 --> 01:06:04.139]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:04.539 --> 01:06:07.160]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.061]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:11.821 --> 01:06:16.162]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:16.602 --> 01:06:19.763]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:20.383 --> 01:06:23.224]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:24.002 --> 01:06:26.143]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:26.183 --> 01:06:28.265]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:28.285 --> 01:06:28.325]  U.S.
[01:06:28.645 --> 01:06:30.386]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:06:30.406 --> 01:06:30.686]  Call 888-8-XANADU.
[01:06:30.706 --> 01:06:31.867]  That's 1-888-8-X-A-N-A-D-U.
[01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:32.707]  Ask for George.
[01:06:56.832 --> 01:06:57.473]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.133 --> 01:06:59.194]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:59.914 --> 01:07:01.015]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:01.675 --> 01:07:02.516]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:04.137]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.797 --> 01:07:08.679]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.042]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:25.447]  Alright, this is Bob Dacey once again substituting for Alex Jones and we have a guest on by the name of Jerome Corsi.
[01:07:26.808 --> 01:07:37.016]  Mr. Corsi is the author of a book called Atomic Iran and the co-author of Black Gold Stranglehold and the New York Times bestseller Unfit for Command.
[01:07:37.756 --> 01:07:41.239]  He's also written a lot of other books and he's got a Ph.D.
[01:07:41.319 --> 01:07:42.960]  from Harvard University.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.061]  And, Mr. Corsi, are you there?
[01:07:46.081 --> 01:07:47.562]  Hey, Bob, I'm right here.
[01:07:47.822 --> 01:07:48.283]  Oh, great.
[01:07:48.343 --> 01:07:50.624]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:50.884 --> 01:07:52.985]  I'm glad you decided to come on today.
[01:07:53.826 --> 01:07:58.849]  We ran into each other several, oh gosh, several months ago.
[01:07:58.889 --> 01:07:59.669]  We corresponded.
[01:07:59.689 --> 01:08:00.690]  I don't know if you remember.
[01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:01.570]  Oh, sure.
[01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.451]  I remember very well.
[01:08:02.771 --> 01:08:05.733]  I sent you a couple of links to some articles.
[01:08:05.773 --> 01:08:08.214]  An article I had written back in 2005 about the...
[01:08:10.581 --> 01:08:34.067]  FDAA and the fact that the highway system was part of that deal, I came to find out that people such as myself and Alex and other people in the whatever you want to call us, truth movement or patriot community, I prefer to think of myself as a strict constructionist of the Constitution, found out that we've got allies and you're one of them.
[01:08:34.748 --> 01:08:36.048]  Go ahead.
[01:08:36.088 --> 01:08:39.789]  You were one of the main, the first guy, you are the first guy in the mainstream to actually
[01:08:40.486 --> 01:08:42.348]  Well, Bob, I started writing the book with Jim Gilchrist, the
[01:09:08.226 --> 01:09:09.607]  Founder of the Minutemen Project.
[01:09:09.907 --> 01:09:15.650]  The book we put out together called Minutemen, The Battle to Secure America's Borders.
[01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.391]  We published it earlier in 2006.
[01:09:19.132 --> 01:09:27.516]  As we were doing the research for that book, I couldn't answer over and over again as I went to the border why President Bush would not secure the border.
[01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:30.658]  It was obvious it wasn't being done.
[01:09:31.338 --> 01:09:33.419]  And we have a war on terror going on.
[01:09:33.559 --> 01:09:37.261]  Well, in the research we did for the book, we were able to prove that
[01:09:37.884 --> 01:09:42.686]  Hezbollah terrorists have gotten into the United States by crossing our border with Mexico.
[01:09:42.706 --> 01:09:48.768]  We had incontrovertible proof, and that the federal government has prosecuted some of those people.
[01:09:48.788 --> 01:09:51.009]  There was a group up in Dearborn, Michigan.
[01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:55.570]  They bribed Mexican consular officials in Beirut.
[01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:57.311]  They got in through Mexico.
[01:09:57.351 --> 01:10:05.094]  They set up shop in Dearborn, and what they did in Dearborn was they started sending money back to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
[01:10:05.114 --> 01:10:06.134]  So they're in federal prison.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:22.909]  Now, you know, President Bush, if you're going to conclude that all the policies of the federal government have a reason, and that's the line we chose to pursue, I chose to conclude that President Bush was keeping that border open intentionally, and there had to be an explanation for it.
[01:10:23.789 --> 01:10:35.756]  And, you know, expert after expert that we talked to kept pointing to the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America, which had been agreed to or declared, I don't think there's actually been any signed agreement
[01:10:36.443 --> 01:10:48.794]  At Waco, Texas, on March 23, 2005, when President Bush and Cindy Fox and Canada's Paul Martin, then the Prime Minister, decided we were in the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.
[01:10:49.475 --> 01:10:55.961]  And as I pursued that, it became clear that at that time, President Bush agreed to erase the borders.
[01:10:55.981 --> 01:10:58.363]  And that's why they were not being closed.
[01:10:58.383 --> 01:11:02.687]  An agreement had been made to keep the border with Mexico and the border with Canada wide open.
[01:11:03.499 --> 01:11:06.660]  And the only border we were going to protect is the perimeter around the continent.
[01:11:07.441 --> 01:11:09.242]  And so that's how I got into the research.
[01:11:09.282 --> 01:11:19.066]  It was the only way I could answer what to me was an apparent contradiction, and that is a war on terror with a border with Mexico and Canada that's wide open.
[01:11:19.927 --> 01:11:23.028]  So you're talking about dissolving the borders?
[01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:31.592]  No, I mean, that was my first breakthrough, is there had to be a reason as to why the borders were being left wide open.
[01:11:32.435 --> 01:11:36.198]  And the reason turns out to be the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:11:36.919 --> 01:11:42.303]  And that is a plan to ultimately, I believe, create a North American Union.
[01:11:42.323 --> 01:11:44.625]  It's a regional government just like the European Union.
[01:11:45.185 --> 01:11:48.508]  Well, apparently, I wonder if you agree with me on this.
[01:11:48.568 --> 01:11:53.852]  I'm sure you've read the Council on Foreign Relations paper for the North American community.
[01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:54.933]  Absolutely.
[01:11:55.974 --> 01:11:57.996]  It seems to be the blueprint for the whole thing.
[01:11:58.016 --> 01:11:58.536]  Would you agree?
[01:11:59.176 --> 01:11:59.497]  Well, yes.
[01:11:59.557 --> 01:12:00.538]  In fact, one of the...
[01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:14.196]  Co-chairs of that panel, Robert Pastors, professor at American University, he's written and explicitly said that Council on Foreign Relations is a blueprint.
[01:12:15.117 --> 01:12:21.261]  And I interviewed him yesterday by telephone for an article I'm going to publish on World Net Daily tomorrow.
[01:12:22.341 --> 01:12:27.565]  And, you know, Pastors pretty much openly acknowledges that that Council on Foreign Relations
[01:12:28.959 --> 01:12:34.981]  Building a North American community is the blueprint behind the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:12:35.301 --> 01:12:43.404]  Well, that pretty much dovetails with what David Rockefeller says about globalism and working against the best interests of the United States.
[01:12:43.444 --> 01:12:45.305]  I mean, they just freely admit it.
[01:12:46.085 --> 01:12:47.185]  It's just out in the open.
[01:12:47.205 --> 01:12:48.025]  Yeah, we're doing this.
[01:12:48.085 --> 01:12:49.686]  What's the problem?
[01:12:50.106 --> 01:12:52.187]  They admit it, and they do it in an incremental way.
[01:12:52.227 --> 01:12:55.688]  In other words, Robert Pastor maintains that he is
[01:12:56.488 --> 01:12:58.809]  Wanting to create only a North American community.
[01:12:58.949 --> 01:13:02.751]  He'll say that a political integration is impossible at this time.
[01:13:03.792 --> 01:13:04.853]  At this time?
[01:13:05.273 --> 01:13:06.033]  Yeah, at this time.
[01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:06.593]  That's the key.
[01:13:06.934 --> 01:13:12.537]  And he won't deny that he's putting in place all of the infrastructure pieces that would lead there.
[01:13:13.197 --> 01:13:16.219]  And that with these pieces in place, it's going to look different.
[01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:22.502]  I mean, I even pointed out to him in interviewing him, and I continually write about that it's the same plan that
[01:13:23.046 --> 01:13:26.487]  It was done in Europe with the European Union in place over 50 years.
[01:13:26.567 --> 01:13:30.268]  Now we have documents like we've got John Monet's memoirs.
[01:13:31.048 --> 01:13:34.849]  And Monet was the architect of the European Union from France.
[01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:43.672]  Monet pretty clearly says in his memoirs that he used deceit, that he knew he couldn't reveal his true plan, which is to create a European Union.
[01:13:43.712 --> 01:13:44.992]  If he did, it would be rejected.
[01:13:45.632 --> 01:13:47.593]  So he intentionally did it piecemeal.
[01:13:48.416 --> 01:13:58.280]  He put it in piece by piece, knowing that each piece put in would make the next piece more logical, more necessary, easier to achieve, and that he was patient.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:15.167]  It went from basically a steel and coal agreement in the Treaty of Rome in 1959, through various stages, to a European common market, to a European community, to European Union, and then the final stage was the euro.
[01:14:15.888 --> 01:14:19.109]  And they still don't have a constitution in place for the European Union.
[01:14:19.129 --> 01:14:26.212]  Of course, the bureaucrats operating the European Union as a regional government in Luxembourg and Brussels don't care.
[01:14:26.813 --> 01:14:30.514]  They're just operating business as usual, constitution or no constitution.
[01:14:30.874 --> 01:14:31.394]  They don't care.
[01:14:31.655 --> 01:14:40.818]  Well, that somewhat sounds familiar to me, everything you just said, because I think the NAFTA started out as a little steel union also.
[01:14:42.899 --> 01:14:44.780]  In fact, the steel component of NAFTA
[01:14:45.365 --> 01:14:47.086]  It's still very central.
[01:14:47.126 --> 01:14:56.471]  I mean, the SPP working groups, we obtained 1,000 pages under a Freedom of Information Act request from SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:14:56.531 --> 01:15:02.575]  It's organized in the Department of Commerce, although it draws throughout the bureaucracy from all the different departments.
[01:15:03.515 --> 01:15:08.258]  And we've archived those papers on minutemanproject.com.
[01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:13.421]  And if you take a look there, you'll see quite a bit of stuff on North American steel policy.
[01:15:14.193 --> 01:15:20.675]  And, you know, that's been one of the central things that SPP.gov has done, just like it was done in Europe.
[01:15:21.655 --> 01:15:23.056]  And I think it's the same model.
[01:15:23.076 --> 01:15:32.978]  We'll go from NAFTA, and now Robert Tassler's pressing to put in place some more components of what he considers important for a North American community.
[01:15:32.998 --> 01:15:37.900]  And once we get that in place, they have all the time denying that they want to do a North American union.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.400]  I expect they'll try to create some crisis.
[01:15:41.341 --> 01:15:41.761]  In fact...
[01:15:42.819 --> 01:15:44.160]  I've got Pastor on record now.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:52.043]  He published an article in Spanish in which he basically said we need a 9-11 crisis to create the North American community.
[01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.704]  And I read it in Spanish.
[01:15:55.505 --> 01:15:59.686]  I'm married to a woman who was born in Argentina, an Italian woman.
[01:16:01.327 --> 01:16:03.848]  I've spoken fluent Spanish for a long time.
[01:16:04.549 --> 01:16:06.509]  By the way, I'm also not opposed to immigration.
[01:16:06.569 --> 01:16:10.551]  We've sponsored people to be legally immigrating from El Salvador.
[01:16:11.752 --> 01:16:12.312]  But at any rate,
[01:16:13.447 --> 01:16:24.557]  Pastor says that it's going to take a crisis to create the North American community, and so now that's the first time that's really been openly stated, and I'm glad I've got that on record before the crisis happened.
[01:16:24.577 --> 01:16:31.482]  That makes me nervous when you say that, because they like to create crises in order to get what they want.
[01:16:31.803 --> 01:16:34.805]  It's kind of a standard operating procedure of these people.
[01:16:34.825 --> 01:16:38.769]  I understand that Mr. Pastor is a Marxist.
[01:16:38.809 --> 01:16:40.290]  Do you agree with that assessment?
[01:16:40.748 --> 01:16:44.249]  Well, certainly his early... I write extensively about that, too.
[01:16:44.289 --> 01:16:48.151]  I mean, he began his career after Harvard.
[01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:50.332]  He went through the same school of Harvard I went through.
[01:16:50.352 --> 01:16:52.032]  He has a Ph.D.
[01:16:52.072 --> 01:16:53.973]  from the Department of Government at the Littauer School.
[01:16:54.773 --> 01:16:57.134]  I went through just a few years before he did.
[01:16:57.154 --> 01:17:03.297]  And then he went to the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington and worked with them.
[01:17:03.317 --> 01:17:08.138]  Now, the Institute for Policy Studies is a socialist communist organization.
[01:17:08.899 --> 01:17:09.119]  It was...
[01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:22.009]  Founded by the person who created Fabergé, who was an admitted communist, and Coral Weiss, who continued a lot of the funding of the organization, another admitted communist.
[01:17:22.989 --> 01:17:29.414]  And the organization, there was a whole book written about the organization, which is called, what's it called?
[01:17:29.675 --> 01:17:30.756]  Covert Cadre.
[01:17:31.556 --> 01:17:33.618]  It was a very famous book written a few years ago.
[01:17:33.638 --> 01:17:39.883]  Just dropped it off my bookshelf by a guy named S. Stephen Powell
[01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:42.968]  And it was inside the Institute for Policy Studies.
[01:17:43.628 --> 01:17:50.753]  And he documented extensively not only Robert Pastore's involvement with IPS, but the communist nature of the organization.
[01:17:51.614 --> 01:17:53.235]  So that's where Pastore started.
[01:17:54.075 --> 01:17:55.876]  Then he worked on the Linowitz Committee.
[01:17:55.896 --> 01:18:04.222]  He saw Linowitz, who was another socialist, and ended up on the National Security Council under Jimmy Carter.
[01:18:04.242 --> 01:18:08.185]  The Linowitz Commission called for giving the Panama Canal to Panama.
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:14.983]  And that was one of the major assignments of Robert Pastor when he was on the National Security Council working for Jimmy Carter.
[01:18:15.163 --> 01:18:25.207]  And if you will recall, if I may interrupt you, when Jimmy Carter was running for president, he openly, publicly stated that if he was president, he would not give away the Panama Canal.
[01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:29.629]  And the first thing he did when he became president was do the exact opposite.
[01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:32.350]  So, I mean, that's a historical fact.
[01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:33.411]  It's not disputable.
[01:18:34.011 --> 01:18:37.032]  Okay, we're talking with Jerome Corsi.
[01:18:37.072 --> 01:18:38.213]  He runs for Human Events...
[01:18:39.207 --> 01:18:40.068]  We're good to go.
[01:19:04.585 --> 01:19:04.946]  I think.
[01:19:19.745 --> 01:19:25.308]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[01:19:52.987 --> 01:19:57.952]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:19:58.273 --> 01:20:00.515]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[01:20:00.575 --> 01:20:03.718]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:20:03.738 --> 01:20:08.043]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:20:08.383 --> 01:20:11.406]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:15.150]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:24.818]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:20:25.078 --> 01:20:28.581]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:20:28.822 --> 01:20:35.928]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:20:36.188 --> 01:20:37.569]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[01:20:37.609 --> 01:20:39.391]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[01:20:52.203 --> 01:20:54.665]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:54.765 --> 01:21:01.592]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[01:21:02.313 --> 01:21:05.115]  It discussed the United States military under U.N.
[01:21:05.195 --> 01:21:05.596]  command.
[01:21:06.306 --> 01:21:06.726]  We're good to go.
[01:21:31.398 --> 01:21:32.819]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.240]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[01:21:52.472 --> 01:21:56.433]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:21:56.653 --> 01:22:00.194]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:22:00.474 --> 01:22:04.554]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:22:04.835 --> 01:22:05.775]  I was so amazed.
[01:22:06.015 --> 01:22:08.875]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light.
[01:22:09.055 --> 01:22:10.936]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:22:11.316 --> 01:22:16.517]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:22:16.997 --> 01:22:22.902]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:22:23.162 --> 01:22:24.904]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:22:25.144 --> 01:22:28.327]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:32.410]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:22:32.711 --> 01:22:34.152]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:22:34.492 --> 01:22:39.615]  If you're interested in natural, homeopathic, time-tested remedies, visit SolayWellness.com.
[01:22:39.675 --> 01:22:42.816]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness.com.
[01:22:42.976 --> 01:22:43.457]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[01:22:43.477 --> 01:22:43.517]  312-224-2710.
[01:23:13.579 --> 01:23:18.467]  Okay, this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones, back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:19.569 --> 01:23:26.461]  We have with us Dr. Jerome Corsi, writes for Human Events Magazine, and we are discussing the North American Union.
[01:23:27.165 --> 01:23:47.940]  And we're discussing, I think we've pretty well established that Robert Pastor, one of the fellows who wrote this treasonous document called Building a North American Community, which is the blueprint for the merger of Canada, the United States, and Mexico into one country, we've pretty well established that this guy is a Marxist, Communist, Socialist type, and I don't think that's very good for the United States of America.
[01:23:47.961 --> 01:23:48.821]  That's just my opinion.
[01:23:49.622 --> 01:23:52.924]  Dr. Corsi, I wanted to actually punctuate that.
[01:23:52.944 --> 01:23:53.925]  I wanted to add to that.
[01:23:54.810 --> 01:24:09.301]  When I attended last October, I attended, it was a year ago, October, for the New American Magazine, a conference at Baylor University having to do with this North American Union.
[01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:19.669]  I was at a dinner at the beginning of that conference, and this keynote speaker was another communist, Dr. Subhash Panechpati.
[01:24:20.449 --> 01:24:24.112]  He's the former head of the United Nations World Trade Organization.
[01:24:25.219 --> 01:24:50.924]  And this guy, he's the keynote speaker, and he actually, during his keynote speech, said that he was having a conversation recently with Bo Xilai, the Trade Minister of Communist China, and that, you know, his father, Bo Yibo, was one of the heroes of the Chinese Communist Revolution.
[01:24:52.131 --> 01:24:53.351]  I don't know why he said that.
[01:24:53.391 --> 01:24:58.893]  Maybe he wanted to impress all the intellectuals on all the business people there and all the nutty professors at Baylor.
[01:24:59.053 --> 01:24:59.574]  I don't know.
[01:25:00.414 --> 01:25:12.758]  But the man actually said in a positive manner it's like a bragging thing that the son of one of Mao's murderers is the trade minister of China.
[01:25:12.778 --> 01:25:15.619]  The guy is a communist.
[01:25:15.879 --> 01:25:21.361]  So it doesn't surprise me that Mr. Pastor is the same thing.
[01:25:23.019 --> 01:25:26.162]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:25:26.842 --> 01:25:35.288]  The whole thinking of Pastor, I think, he in particular is very anti-American in terms of his ideas.
[01:25:35.308 --> 01:25:36.269]  He's written a couple of books.
[01:25:36.309 --> 01:25:44.595]  He wrote a book with a communist, Jorge Castaneda, who was a Mexican communist candidate for president of Mexico.
[01:25:45.276 --> 01:25:48.878]  Also turned up to be the foreign minister for Vicente Fox.
[01:25:50.179 --> 01:25:52.161]  Pastor and Castaneda traded houses
[01:25:53.012 --> 01:25:56.853]  I'd like to subjugate the United States more to Mexico and Canada.
[01:25:56.893 --> 01:25:58.654]  He's very positively disposed towards Mexico.
[01:26:23.010 --> 01:26:25.252]  I don't find that he's nearly spent the time in Canada.
[01:26:26.553 --> 01:26:31.116]  And that's all an anti-American kind of wish.
[01:26:31.797 --> 01:26:40.524]  And his thinking is often to subjugate the United States very much like the European Union sought to subjugate Germany.
[01:26:41.745 --> 01:26:47.229]  Not realizing that Germany would probably end up dominating the European Union to everybody else's detriment.
[01:26:47.884 --> 01:26:49.725]  Which is largely what's happened.
[01:26:50.065 --> 01:26:55.867]  Well, in colloquial terms, colloquial terms that I coined, by the way, Mexico is a crookocracy.
[01:26:56.727 --> 01:27:06.310]  How can anyone want to merge the United States with the crookedest country in the Western Hemisphere?
[01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:11.472]  How in any stretch of the imagination can that come out good for the good old U.S.
[01:27:11.532 --> 01:27:11.792]  of A?
[01:27:12.472 --> 01:27:13.493]  Well, I think that's a good question.
[01:27:13.573 --> 01:27:16.834]  I mean, I'm concerned about the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:31.584]  We've got this Trusted Traveler and Trusted Trader program where we're going to let, just on biometric and other electronic identification, we're going to let anybody from Mexico or any trucking company come across the borders.
[01:27:32.545 --> 01:27:37.246]  And Mexico is a drug cartel-controlled country.
[01:27:37.886 --> 01:27:40.206]  A few oligarchical families control the wealth.
[01:27:41.347 --> 01:27:42.767]  Corruption and graft
[01:27:43.887 --> 01:27:46.269]  Bribery are the order of the day in Mexico.
[01:27:46.289 --> 01:27:48.751]  If you want to get anything done, you've got to bribe somebody.
[01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:49.672]  Well, absolutely.
[01:27:49.792 --> 01:27:53.175]  I mean, I can give a concrete example of that a few years ago.
[01:27:53.756 --> 01:28:03.004]  I used to go to this gun show here in Austin all the time, selling gun safes to keep the evil things out of the hands of people who aren't supposed to touch them.
[01:28:04.044 --> 01:28:06.927]  And at that time, during that period, it was probably 1999, I think,
[01:28:08.985 --> 01:28:18.290]  One of the guys that frequented the gun show made the mistake of crossing the border into Mexico, and he had a round of .22 shell on his dashboard.
[01:28:19.471 --> 01:28:23.713]  And boy, in order to get him out of there, they had to bribe him out.
[01:28:24.273 --> 01:28:26.414]  So that's just the way it is.
[01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:29.236]  Okay, once again, we're coming up on a break.
[01:28:29.256 --> 01:28:34.979]  We're talking with Dr. Jerome Corsi about the North American Union, and we'll be back in a few.
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:43.561]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.021 --> 01:28:45.623]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.543 --> 01:28:49.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.589 --> 01:28:54.190]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[01:28:54.490 --> 01:29:03.098]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[01:29:03.458 --> 01:29:09.183]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[01:29:09.563 --> 01:29:17.006]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[01:29:17.326 --> 01:29:22.688]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.

[01:29:52.392 --> 01:29:53.092]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:53.112 --> 01:29:59.953]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[01:30:00.193 --> 01:30:07.315]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:18.977]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:30:19.357 --> 01:30:21.237]  Its multi-voltage capabilities multiply
[01:30:21.237 --> 01:30:26.738]  Multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:30:27.019 --> 01:30:32.000]  Simply place the Berkey solar charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:37.141]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:30:37.441 --> 01:30:42.823]  Get the incredible Berkey solar charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.843 --> 01:30:44.043]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:30:50.825 --> 01:30:51.206]  4-4-3-8.
[01:30:52.467 --> 01:30:56.513]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:56.733 --> 01:31:00.138]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:00.298 --> 01:31:03.743]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:04.033 --> 01:31:07.276]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:07.296 --> 01:31:12.781]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:12.821 --> 01:31:22.450]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:22.570 --> 01:31:23.892]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:31:23.912 --> 01:31:29.357]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:29.853 --> 01:31:34.296]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:34.376 --> 01:31:35.737]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:35.897 --> 01:31:39.719]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:39.819 --> 01:31:40.639]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:14.575]  All right, this is Bob Basie for Alex Jones.
[01:32:14.976 --> 01:32:23.262]  Once again, we're talking to Dr. Jerome Corsi about the North American Union, and I want to finish up on my little anecdotal story about the corruption in Mexico.
[01:32:24.127 --> 01:32:36.557]  The fellow crosses the border, accidentally has a .22 shell on the dashboard of his truck, while the federales arrest him, and they throw him in jail, and they accuse him of smuggling arms to the Chiapas rebels, okay?
[01:32:37.338 --> 01:32:46.265]  So everybody in the gun show community was concerned about this, and I, for one, I called my local congressman, at the time it was Lloyd Doggett,
[01:32:47.367 --> 01:32:53.349]  And I got a hold of one of his representatives and I explained the situation to him and the man just flat out said it.
[01:32:53.389 --> 01:32:55.169]  He says, listen, you know how it is in Mexico.
[01:32:55.729 --> 01:32:58.710]  The only way you're going to get anything done down there is to bribe somebody.
[01:32:59.190 --> 01:33:00.411]  Well, that's right.
[01:33:00.451 --> 01:33:02.051]  You know, that's just the way it works down there.
[01:33:02.071 --> 01:33:06.672]  And so we're going to merge with Mexico and Dr. Pastor thinks that's a great idea, right?
[01:33:06.893 --> 01:33:15.375]  Well, and also the idea that we're going to rely on Mexico for our border security while we've got a war on terror going on
[01:33:16.368 --> 01:33:19.109]  It just shows you the war on terror is probably a joke altogether.
[01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:22.371]  Well, you say probably a joke.
[01:33:22.591 --> 01:33:23.512]  Let's get this straight.
[01:33:23.552 --> 01:33:34.237]  You just laid out a situation which has happened already where a bunch of terrorists have been caught, arrested, tried, and convicted, and they're in U.S.
[01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:36.258]  prisons coming up through Mexico, right?
[01:33:36.578 --> 01:33:37.378]  That's exactly right.
[01:33:37.398 --> 01:33:38.199]  We'll give you their names.
[01:33:38.219 --> 01:33:43.221]  Take a look at my book, Minutemen, Battles to Secure America's Borders.
[01:33:43.261 --> 01:33:44.302]  I'm going to go right now.
[01:33:44.878 --> 01:33:45.358]  Page 162.
[01:33:45.558 --> 01:33:46.138]  Uh-huh.
[01:33:46.818 --> 01:33:48.059]  And I'll read you their names.
[01:33:48.179 --> 01:33:48.619]  All right.
[01:33:48.659 --> 01:33:51.239]  Yeah, let's do this because we like to document everything we say, right?
[01:33:51.599 --> 01:33:51.999]  That's right.
[01:33:52.019 --> 01:33:53.139]  Because you're so fantastic.
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:34:01.981]  March 1st, 2005, Mahmoud Youssef Kourani pleaded guilty to federal charges.
[01:34:02.541 --> 01:34:08.182]  They'd used the meetings in his home in Dearborn, Michigan to raise money for Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon.
[01:34:08.802 --> 01:34:11.703]  Page 162 of Minutemen, The Battles Cure America's Borders.
[01:34:11.723 --> 01:34:14.063]  And if you look at the footnote, it'll even tell you the...
[01:34:14.651 --> 01:34:19.993]  Case number and give you the internet link to go look at the prosecutor's records up on the internet.
[01:34:20.013 --> 01:34:24.034]  I mean, it's, you know, it's, I'm looking at it right now.
[01:34:24.074 --> 01:34:32.517]  I mean, it's basically, we had the entire thing fully documented, and then we also showed another couple of cases.
[01:34:33.297 --> 01:34:44.081]  There was a, in 2002, Salim Bukhadar Bukhadafil, who had a cafe in Mexico, Tijuana,
[01:34:44.972 --> 01:34:49.814]  It was a cafe that was called the Lebanese Cafe in downtown Tijuana.
[01:34:50.374 --> 01:34:56.976]  And he was using that restaurant to smuggle Hezbollah agents into the United States for cash.
[01:34:58.196 --> 01:34:59.517]  It was a whole smuggling scheme.
[01:34:59.557 --> 01:35:02.618]  It was busted by the Federales.
[01:35:03.398 --> 01:35:09.140]  And November 12, 2003, I had this on page 164 of Minutemen, The Battle to Secure America's Borders.
[01:35:11.167 --> 01:35:28.837]  Mexican authorities actually even arrested Imelda Ortiz Abdallah, who was the Mexican consul in Lebanon, and charged him with human trafficking charges for helping Bouguader organize a smuggling scheme in Tijuana in the Lebanese cafe.
[01:35:29.518 --> 01:35:31.299]  I mean, how much more documentation do we need?
[01:35:31.419 --> 01:35:33.180]  Well, I don't think you need any more documentation.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.280]  I think it's well documented.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.722]  The question is, doesn't President Bush know about this?
[01:35:37.362 --> 01:35:40.244]  You know, he's got to know about it.
[01:35:40.851 --> 01:35:46.673]  If he doesn't, I'll be happy to send him a copy of the book with this section outlined in yellow and make it easy for him to find it.
[01:35:46.753 --> 01:35:53.555]  So once again, assuming that the administration, we all know that they're out to protect us from evil terrorists, right?
[01:35:54.096 --> 01:35:54.416]  Right.
[01:35:54.836 --> 01:35:55.796]  That's what they keep telling us.
[01:35:56.076 --> 01:36:02.338]  They give us an anal probe at the airport and some of them give you your own private room for your anal probe.
[01:36:02.378 --> 01:36:09.501]  That's why the whole issue of we better fight them over there in Iraq before we have to fight them here
[01:36:10.091 --> 01:36:10.651]  It's a joke.
[01:36:10.671 --> 01:36:12.393]  We're letting them in here through the back door.
[01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.614]  Yeah, well, and the question is, why?
[01:36:15.255 --> 01:36:16.275]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:36:16.295 --> 01:36:25.481]  I mean, you have a chief executive officer of the United States, the president, who is elected.
[01:36:25.982 --> 01:36:36.789]  He puts his hand on a Bible in front of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, which is required, actually, in the Constitution, and he swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[01:36:37.994 --> 01:36:38.515]  Of America.
[01:36:38.575 --> 01:36:40.416]  I mean, this is on national TV.
[01:36:40.476 --> 01:36:41.957]  This is documentable, right?
[01:36:42.137 --> 01:36:42.357]  Right.
[01:36:42.558 --> 01:36:44.479]  Okay.
[01:36:44.659 --> 01:36:46.080]  Take a look at these things I'm publishing.
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:59.489]  I got the article yesterday, and it's reprinted here today again on World Net Daily, about how this dollar collapse that we're in the very first stages of, dollar is being devalued.
[01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:01.331]  We've got a huge trade delegation.
[01:37:01.751 --> 01:37:07.195]  We've got two, five cabinet secretaries in China, Secretary Paul Sinead and
[01:37:07.794 --> 01:37:09.095]  Do you think the dollar collapsed?
[01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:10.317]  I think the dollar is imminent.
[01:37:25.069 --> 01:37:31.870]  And I think what will result in that is that will be the crisis needed to put the Amero in as the currency of North America.
[01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:33.030]  That's what I was just going to ask you.
[01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:40.412]  Do you think that this is the crisis that you referred to earlier in order to give them an excuse to bring in the Amero?
[01:37:41.312 --> 01:37:51.614]  I think it's all been... We take a look at these pieces and you've got to say, okay, if the dollar is going to collapse, and I've got a piece today in
[01:37:52.646 --> 01:38:05.399]  WorldNetDaily that shows out of this federal, you know, we're now required to, the Treasury is going to release it on Friday, which is the report on the, they do one time a year a gap accounting of the federal deficit.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.665]  Well, they've been saying the federal deficit is about $284 billion.
[01:38:10.705 --> 01:38:13.628]  The true number that this report on Friday is going to show is $3.5 trillion.
[01:38:15.305 --> 01:38:17.446]  A little bit of a magnitude of a difference there, isn't it?
[01:38:17.466 --> 01:38:25.448]  Yes, a trillion with a T. And the difference is that what the Treasury reports all year long is kind of a cash basis.
[01:38:25.468 --> 01:38:34.811]  In other words, the Social Security taxes produce tax revenue, and the Treasury just uses it to pay current obligations, whatever they are.
[01:38:35.571 --> 01:38:44.734]  But in the GAAP accounting, they're forced to address all of the Social Security liabilities that are not being reserved for
[01:38:45.476 --> 01:38:51.443]  And the Medicare liabilities, forced to do it all on a gap accounting basis, not a cash basis.
[01:38:52.084 --> 01:39:01.515]  And when you do that and you put all those liabilities in, instead of $284 billion as the deficit of the 2006 federal budget from George Bush,
[01:39:02.108 --> 01:39:04.669]  It's going to be $3.5 trillion.
[01:39:04.929 --> 01:39:10.852]  Well, yeah, but I don't think you have anything to worry about there, because after all, you know, they just print the money on a thin air anyway.
[01:39:10.872 --> 01:39:13.974]  It's just going to make the money worthless, but they'll pay for everything, you know.
[01:39:14.334 --> 01:39:25.480]  Well, they've been monetizing our debt for years, and that's what they've been doing, Bob, but there comes a point where you can't do it anymore, and that point happens if the dollar seriously begins to collapse.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:31.583]  I mean, the stories I've done this past week have talked to some people who follow this very closely,
[01:39:32.516 --> 01:39:36.339]  The Fed quit printing data on M3.
[01:39:36.579 --> 01:39:44.944]  M3 is a money supply index that has been used, especially since Milton Friedman, to watch the growth of the economy.
[01:39:46.085 --> 01:39:49.307]  Money supply is one of those critical indexes on monetary policy.
[01:39:49.867 --> 01:39:51.368]  M3 is the broadest index.
[01:39:51.969 --> 01:39:56.352]  It indicates really the full range of money that's around in the economy.
[01:39:56.392 --> 01:39:59.854]  And M3 plus credit, just about all the money you can find,
[01:40:00.347 --> 01:40:01.147]  It's been increasing at 11%.
[01:40:01.987 --> 01:40:07.288]  I found some economists who have reconstructed the data even though the Fed no longer prints it.
[01:40:07.388 --> 01:40:10.889]  So they're backing into the amount and they estimate it to be what now?
[01:40:11.469 --> 01:40:14.650]  Well, the deficit is going to be $3.5 trillion.
[01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.930]  But not printing M3.
[01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:20.551]  You see, M3, the economy is awash in liquidity.
[01:40:20.931 --> 01:40:22.531]  There's all kinds of money around.
[01:40:23.072 --> 01:40:24.692]  And that's what's keeping the stock market up.
[01:40:24.752 --> 01:40:26.432]  It's what's keeping a lot of things afloat.
[01:40:27.572 --> 01:40:30.033]  And also the yield curve is inverted.
[01:40:30.951 --> 01:40:37.475]  Which means long-term interest rates are lower than short-term interest rates, which usually only happens when we go into a recession.
[01:40:38.175 --> 01:40:43.918]  So what I'm saying is that the situation we're at right now is at the beginning of a pretty deep recession.
[01:40:44.458 --> 01:40:45.099]  It's begun.
[01:40:45.879 --> 01:40:53.183]  And the dollar is going to go into a crisis through that recession in which it could dramatically be devalued and possibly even collapse.
[01:40:54.164 --> 01:41:00.227]  If these kinds of things begin happening, then the American public are going to wake up to the reality
[01:41:01.219 --> 01:41:13.123]  That, you know, the government has probably allowed ourselves to become bankrupt, and it's because of several things, but certainly the huge trade deficits were running with China under NAFTA, free trade agreements.
[01:41:13.183 --> 01:41:14.864]  All the manufacturing is going to China.
[01:41:15.604 --> 01:41:24.467]  China's shipping in tons of slave goods here, and they're coming in through the NAFTA superhighways that are being planned, like the Trans-Texas Corridor in Texas.
[01:41:25.276 --> 01:41:31.279]  With these goods coming in through ports like Manzanilla and Lazaro Cardenas down in the Pacific in Mexico.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:36.963]  Well, let's talk about that because that is, all this stuff is linked.
[01:41:37.603 --> 01:41:51.731]  You know, the dissolving of the borders, the North American Union merging Canada, United States and Mexico into one unit both politically and economically and even culturally.
[01:41:52.451 --> 01:41:53.612]  All this stuff is linked and
[01:41:54.190 --> 01:42:04.637]  But when you talk about the economic component of it, the central beneficiary of this NAFTA superhighway is not the Mexicans.
[01:42:05.697 --> 01:42:06.578]  It's not us.
[01:42:06.878 --> 01:42:07.999]  It's the communist Chinese.
[01:42:08.499 --> 01:42:08.899]  Well, that's right.
[01:42:08.919 --> 01:42:10.640]  Do you want to elaborate on that as to why?
[01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:11.581]  Well, sure.
[01:42:11.601 --> 01:42:14.403]  I mean, all the manufacturing is going over to China.
[01:42:15.003 --> 01:42:20.847]  China has slaves, actually literally slaves, political prisoners in concentration camps.
[01:42:21.587 --> 01:42:30.450]  And they've also got people that are paid 20, 30 cents an hour to work in these 4,000 person factories.
[01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:32.971]  They have to live there and sleep there.
[01:42:32.991 --> 01:42:34.611]  Yeah, I've seen some of the documentary.
[01:42:34.951 --> 01:42:40.193]  They're charged for their food and their rent, and they're only paid 30 or 40 cents an hour.
[01:42:40.753 --> 01:42:42.514]  They owe their soul to the company store?
[01:42:42.554 --> 01:42:43.754]  That's right, exactly.
[01:42:44.475 --> 01:42:46.755]  The old Tennessee Ernie Ford song all over again.
[01:42:49.381 --> 01:43:00.904]  If we allow that to happen, previously we had free trade agreements that had anti-slavery or anti-dumping clauses in it, which would not let the goods from this kind of production come in.
[01:43:00.964 --> 01:43:06.265]  But Bush administration, Kmart, I guess it's wrong to have African-American slaves because we can see them.
[01:43:06.925 --> 01:43:13.646]  But it's not wrong for these people to have Chinese slaves because I guess they're just little yellow people we can't see.
[01:43:13.706 --> 01:43:15.707]  Well, I want to tell you it's wrong in both instances.
[01:43:16.881 --> 01:43:20.163]  And I'll say it's okay to use the Chinese labor like this.
[01:43:20.744 --> 01:43:28.369]  It's immoral and wrong, and it's going to produce the same kind of crises that using the African-American slaves did in the 1700s and 1800s.
[01:43:28.389 --> 01:43:42.318]  Yeah, but now you have this high-tech slavery system where, let's say some of the slaves misbehave too much, they can turn them from slaves into prisoners, and then once they're prisoners, they can harvest their body organs and sell them on the open market.
[01:43:42.637 --> 01:43:43.898]  Well, China's doing that too.
[01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:44.438]  Exactly.
[01:43:44.498 --> 01:43:45.558]  I mean, that is not a joke.
[01:43:45.679 --> 01:43:50.561]  They are doing it openly, and their excuse is, well, they're just prisoners.
[01:43:51.261 --> 01:43:53.402]  I've documented that in the articles I've written too.
[01:43:53.502 --> 01:44:01.906]  I mean, can the listeners just back up for a minute and appreciate the moral horror that we're talking about here?
[01:44:02.827 --> 01:44:08.530]  Well, everybody should appreciate it because it's unacceptable.
[01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:10.491]  It's the same kind of thing we did in the 1700s and 1800s.
[01:44:11.949 --> 01:44:23.498]  And if you allow capitalism to proceed in an unbridled way, I'm sure before the Civil War you could have found plenty of people who would have argued for you that slavery was part of the economic system and we needed it.
[01:44:23.518 --> 01:44:26.060]  In fact, that's largely why the war was fought.
[01:44:27.101 --> 01:44:27.602]  Civil War.
[01:44:27.622 --> 01:44:37.530]  And again, in this case, we're probably going to be facing another kind of war eventually to pay the price of this slavery that we're allowing to come into the United States.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.581]  While we're doing it, the manufacturing jobs are being sucked out of here, just like Ross Perot said they would be.
[01:44:44.602 --> 01:44:46.962]  Even the jobs in Mexico.
[01:44:47.442 --> 01:44:50.143]  Mexican labor is not cheap enough compared to Chinese.
[01:44:50.923 --> 01:45:01.966]  And if we allow this to go on, you know, if China starts getting economically improved at all, well, they'll just move on to Indonesia or to the Middle East or wherever they can actually get more slaves cheaper again.
[01:45:02.766 --> 01:45:07.767]  Because the international globalists don't care where the goods come from, just so they're cheap.
[01:45:08.546 --> 01:45:10.587]  I would like to add to that myself also.
[01:45:10.707 --> 01:45:27.256]  At the conference that I attended last October, over a year ago, at Baylor University, this Free Trade in the Americas conference, one of the speakers at one of the talks was Victor Lopez-Viafane, who was the trade representative from Mexico.
[01:45:27.276 --> 01:45:28.817]  He gave a talk, a PowerPoint presentation,
[01:45:31.252 --> 01:45:32.553]  China is the winner of NAFTA.
[01:45:32.573 --> 01:45:32.833]  Absolutely.
[01:45:32.953 --> 01:45:34.893]  The reason these superhighways are being...
[01:45:57.154 --> 01:46:09.937]  Yeah, because the most expensive component of the transportation of the Communist Chinese slave goods is when they get to our shores and the Americans actually have to touch them.
[01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:11.277]  And they have to make a living.
[01:46:11.297 --> 01:46:13.917]  Okay, so that means teamsters and longshoremen.
[01:46:14.017 --> 01:46:15.438]  And that means American truckers.
[01:46:23.121 --> 01:46:25.623]  And also United Transportation workers on the train.
[01:46:25.923 --> 01:46:38.232]  Okay, so basically one of the economic components of this superhighway is to completely avoid American transportation industry.
[01:46:38.752 --> 01:46:42.815]  Or to minimize it to the extent it can be minimized.
[01:46:43.036 --> 01:46:44.176]  And then once these things...
[01:46:46.469 --> 01:46:52.671]  By the way, I'm very well aware, and I'm sure you are, that this port of Lazaro Cardenas, is how you pronounce it?
[01:46:52.872 --> 01:46:54.312]  Lazaro Cardenas, yeah.
[01:46:54.832 --> 01:47:11.418]  The Communist Chinese have a deal, that's the Hutchison Port Holdings, which is a subsidiary of Hutchison-Mampoa, the Communist Chinese humongous company, has a deal with Walmart to expand that port from its about 100,000 container capacity per year
[01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:18.111]  To 700,000 per year to then 2 million containers per year.
[01:47:18.611 --> 01:47:20.252]  And, of course, that causes a problem.
[01:47:20.873 --> 01:47:30.858]  Dr. Corsi, how are they going to get all the communist Chinese slave goods from that port, which they're expanding like crazy, up into the United States?
[01:47:30.878 --> 01:47:31.738]  How are they going to get them there?
[01:47:32.218 --> 01:47:39.442]  First of all, the idea is if that port is below Kansas City, those trans-Texas corridor, which is going to get built first,
[01:47:40.222 --> 01:47:46.547]  Go from Laredo, Texas, four football fields wide, highway and train corridor.
[01:47:47.888 --> 01:47:51.051]  That will allow the trucks and the trains in Mexico.
[01:47:51.091 --> 01:47:56.355]  Kansas City Southern has already bought the Mexican trains, so they bill themselves as the NAFTA Railroad.
[01:47:57.316 --> 01:48:07.784]  So you could have Mexican truck drivers, Mexican train workers, Mexican dock workers at Lazaro Cardenas, and they're also going to open up a little north of that, Manzanilla,
[01:48:08.456 --> 01:48:13.377]  They're going to open up on the west coast, on the Baja, a port called Punta Colonet.
[01:48:14.538 --> 01:48:24.280]  Also, they're going to deepen, and they're going to dig a new Panama Canal, which Hutchinson Wampolo manages each end of that now, thanks to Jimmy Carter and Robert Pastor.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:36.023]  And they'll dig a deeper one, so these post-Panamax ships that don't fit through the current canal, China's going to have ships, container ships, that carry 12,500 containers
[01:48:38.939 --> 01:48:40.920]  Now, those are, that's more containers.
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:45.941]  That's about three or four times the size of any container ship anybody's seen.
[01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:51.623]  And, you know, when you get those containers stacked up in there, it's going to look like a skyscraper in terms of its height.
[01:48:52.623 --> 01:49:02.066]  Those container ships will now go through the Panama Canal, and they can go directly across the Gulf of Mexico and land in Florida, ports like Miami or Jacksonville.
[01:49:02.826 --> 01:49:07.948]  So these corridors that are being built, like the Trans-Texas Corridor, you can have multiple ones of them.
[01:49:08.496 --> 01:49:19.425]  You can bring these goods in by water through Mexico or across the Panama Canal to where you're not having to lug anything east to west across the United States.
[01:49:20.226 --> 01:49:23.749]  And Mexico is already going to have a customs office in Kansas City.
[01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:25.451]  That'll make it easier, too.
[01:49:25.471 --> 01:49:26.652]  All right.
[01:49:26.872 --> 01:49:28.473]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, stay there.
[01:49:28.493 --> 01:49:30.435]  Are you going to be able to hang with us for the next hour?
[01:49:31.558 --> 01:49:32.360]  For a little while, sure.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.463]  I can hang with you for a while.
[01:49:33.663 --> 01:49:33.984]  Okay.
[01:49:34.004 --> 01:49:39.419]  Well, we're going to be right back after the break talking with Dr. Jerome Corsi about the North American Union.
[01:49:55.578 --> 01:49:58.760]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.101 --> 01:50:01.022]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:01.402 --> 01:50:09.088]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.748 --> 01:50:16.813]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.213 --> 01:50:20.135]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:20.495 --> 01:50:22.857]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:23.277 --> 01:50:24.118]  NSA spies.

[01:50:52.412 --> 01:51:00.237]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:51:00.497 --> 01:51:02.098]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:51:02.338 --> 01:51:04.820]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:19.769]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:19.809 --> 01:51:20.109]  government.
[01:51:20.309 --> 01:51:22.110]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:28.395]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:33.039]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:53:04.706 --> 01:53:11.288]  Okay, this is Bob Daisy back with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:53:11.348 --> 01:53:24.292]  I think we ought to be talking about north to Kansas City because that's where the NAFTA Superhighway is going to have its Mexican customs port right in the middle of the United States and that's not a conspiracy theory either.
[01:53:24.953 --> 01:53:25.833]  They're building that.
[01:53:26.213 --> 01:53:30.855]  Dr. Corsi, again, I want to get back to this problem here.
[01:53:30.875 --> 01:53:32.295]  You've got these massive
[01:53:33.046 --> 01:53:36.569]  Well, the basic idea here is the borders are going to simply be stopping points electronically.
[01:54:02.124 --> 01:54:10.273]  According to SPP.gov, Security and Prosperity Partnership Working Groups, they got established after this Waco, Texas meeting.
[01:54:11.154 --> 01:54:15.739]  The Mexican trucks are going to be considered trusted traders.
[01:54:15.779 --> 01:54:18.262]  They're going to get issued these Sentry chips.
[01:54:19.103 --> 01:54:21.125]  So they can put these electronic chips in their truck
[01:54:21.815 --> 01:54:24.396]  And when they come to the border, it'll be like going through an easy pass.
[01:54:24.436 --> 01:54:28.358]  They'll get recognized as a trusted trader, and they'll go across the border.
[01:54:28.458 --> 01:54:34.580]  Yeah, but we already established that Mexico is a crococracy, and who knows what's going to be in those trucks?
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:42.343]  Well, and also Mexican drug companies, cartels, have been buying trucking companies for decades to launder cash.
[01:54:44.821 --> 01:54:45.802]  I don't think I heard you correctly.
[01:54:45.862 --> 01:54:50.245]  Are you saying that the Mexican drug cartels are buying Mexican trucking companies?
[01:54:50.505 --> 01:54:51.045]  Absolutely.
[01:54:51.125 --> 01:54:52.706]  You just said that?
[01:54:52.766 --> 01:54:53.947]  Uh-huh.
[01:54:53.967 --> 01:54:57.009]  They own a lot of the so-called legitimate businesses.
[01:54:57.069 --> 01:55:00.031]  Well, trucking is one of the ones the drug companies use.
[01:55:00.071 --> 01:55:01.732]  How do they get their drugs around?
[01:55:01.792 --> 01:55:03.373]  They buy the trucking companies.
[01:55:03.433 --> 01:55:08.136]  Okay, so I'm looking at a website from a company called Savi Technology.
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:09.120]  Right.
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:10.921]  Which is the Lockheed Martin Company.
[01:55:10.941 --> 01:55:12.422]  Yep, and I've been writing about them, too.
[01:55:12.522 --> 01:55:14.463]  I want to just read this here.
[01:55:14.883 --> 01:55:16.264]  This is from 2005.
[01:55:16.664 --> 01:55:20.086]  It's from a press release in there.
[01:55:20.926 --> 01:55:28.730]  Savi Technology and Hutchinson Port Holdings established a new company to deploy RFID network to track and manage ocean cargo shipments.
[01:55:29.091 --> 01:55:29.671]  That's right.
[01:55:31.172 --> 01:55:35.534]  And not only that, that subsidiary that they set up together with Hutchinson Wampoa
[01:55:36.033 --> 01:55:39.376]  is negotiating a contract right now with NASCO.
[01:55:39.956 --> 01:55:41.217]  NASCO is in Dallas.
[01:55:41.257 --> 01:55:43.279]  They're a trade organization.
[01:55:43.319 --> 01:55:46.481]  They're committed to North American Super Corridor Coalition.
[01:55:46.781 --> 01:55:47.022]  Yeah.
[01:55:47.182 --> 01:55:50.264]  And they're the ones who have been supporting this I-35 corridor.
[01:55:50.284 --> 01:55:50.905]  Exactly.
[01:55:50.925 --> 01:55:52.486]  I've been calling it after Super Highway.
[01:55:52.706 --> 01:55:52.926]  Right.
[01:55:53.386 --> 01:56:03.154]  So now, you know, Hutchinson, Wampoa, the Communist Chinese are going to be able to have direct information about all the trucks and trains and everything else, RFID chips,
[01:56:03.598 --> 01:56:05.640]  They'll know where they are in America at any given time.
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:11.865]  I guess if you wanted to put a nuclear weapon in one of those containers, you could even track its progress through the United States until you detonated it.
[01:56:11.885 --> 01:56:15.307]  You could detonate it through one of those RFID chips if you wanted to.
[01:56:15.327 --> 01:56:22.033]  I just kind of wonder again why our administration seems to be so oblivious to all this information.
[01:56:22.093 --> 01:56:23.714]  It's unbelievable to me.
[01:56:24.475 --> 01:56:32.181]  The Bush administration, all the things they've been writing, they've been telling people who call into the congressman's offices and everything else, oh, this is just
[01:56:32.714 --> 01:56:33.914]  Normal course of business.
[01:56:33.994 --> 01:56:35.295]  We're in a dialogue.
[01:56:35.315 --> 01:56:40.156]  If you look at SPP.gov's website, they've got a myths versus facts section.
[01:56:40.717 --> 01:56:43.758]  And they say, we're not building a North American union.
[01:56:44.078 --> 01:56:45.678]  Well, what are they doing?
[01:56:45.698 --> 01:56:48.039]  Why don't we shut down SPP.gov?
[01:56:48.499 --> 01:56:51.680]  We don't need all this integration and harmonization of our laws.
[01:56:52.501 --> 01:56:53.681]  I need to get this straight.
[01:56:53.701 --> 01:56:56.182]  You see, you've got this huge, the big picture here.
[01:56:56.222 --> 01:56:59.883]  You've got American jobs and manufacturing companies
[01:57:00.543 --> 01:57:09.925]  Shutting down all over the country, going to China because of onerous regulations here and because of American trade policy that's voiced on us by the Congress.
[01:57:10.525 --> 01:57:17.167]  And then this is just going to exacerbate that as they make more and more and more keep communist Chinese slave goods.
[01:57:17.247 --> 01:57:23.048]  And this insanity will continue with this insanity after the top of the hour.
[01:57:23.609 --> 01:57:25.009]  Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.

[01:57:36.872 --> 01:57:37.373]  Big Brother.
[01:57:37.413 --> 01:57:38.333]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.373 --> 01:57:39.494]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:39.514 --> 01:57:43.678]  You want answers?
[01:57:43.798 --> 01:57:45.920]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.547 --> 01:57:59.528]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.748 --> 01:58:03.849]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:17.172]  Okay, this is Bob Basie substituting both today and tomorrow for Alex Jones here on the Alex Jones Show on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:17.951 --> 01:58:25.017]  Alex's websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv, to name a few.
[01:58:25.297 --> 01:58:31.822]  We've been discussing the merger of the United States, Canada, and Mexico with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:58:32.522 --> 01:58:37.046]  He is a writer for Human Events Magazine and for WorldNetDaily.
[01:58:37.646 --> 01:58:39.968]  Speaking of WorldNetDaily, Dr. Corsi...
[01:58:41.414 --> 01:58:57.101]  One of the things I'm trying to communicate and get at is the physical process of getting the communist Chinese slave goods from Lazaro Cardenas to the border because the highway isn't there yet to the degree that it needs to be.
[01:58:57.221 --> 01:59:04.064]  So the question is, who is going to build the Mexican portion of the trans-Texas corridor and after Superhighway?
[01:59:04.584 --> 01:59:05.604]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:59:06.505 --> 01:59:09.406]  Robert Pastor is asking for there to be a
[01:59:10.290 --> 01:59:15.732]  North American Investment Fund that would build additional highway infrastructure within Mexico.
[01:59:15.752 --> 01:59:32.257]  And I'd probably take that kind of a structure because there's not enough traffic probably to justify the Spanish to come in and Sinfra is going to put $280 billion building out these trans-Texas corridor highways in the next 50 years.
[01:59:32.757 --> 01:59:34.537]  All the tolls are going to go to Spain.
[01:59:35.598 --> 01:59:38.259]  But I don't think Spain is going to build the roads in Mexico yet.
[01:59:39.219 --> 01:59:39.379]  So...
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:43.101]  Robert Pastner says let's get a public investment fund to do it.
[01:59:43.701 --> 01:59:45.502]  You mean American taxpayer money?
[01:59:45.522 --> 01:59:46.682]  American tax dollars.
[01:59:47.142 --> 01:59:48.382]  Our money going to Mexico.
[01:59:48.422 --> 01:59:49.603]  Okay, back it up, back it up.
[01:59:49.623 --> 01:59:52.604]  Four billion being thrown away into Mexico.
[01:59:52.684 --> 01:59:54.144]  Wait, wait, back this up.
[01:59:54.264 --> 01:59:58.926]  I want everybody to understand what he just said, and this is documentably true.
[01:59:59.986 --> 02:00:06.868]  American taxpayers whose jobs are being shipped overseas so that the Chinese communists can mill the slave goods
[02:00:08.455 --> 02:00:23.762]  Are now going to be expected through this North American investment fund to build the Mexican portion of the trans-Texas corridor to get the cheap communist Chinese slave goods up into America so that they can further the process of eliminating more American jobs.
[02:00:23.782 --> 02:00:31.005]  Is this what we're... That's exactly right because, you see, this whole build rose down into the center and south of Mexico.
[02:00:31.025 --> 02:00:34.567]  Robert Pasteur argues that that's needed to develop Mexico.
[02:00:35.347 --> 02:00:35.607]  Yeah.
[02:00:35.707 --> 02:00:37.008]  And then, you know, of course,
[02:00:37.847 --> 02:00:47.753]  The taxpayers will pay for it, and the Mexicans will utilize it to transport the goods, but even the Mexicans are going to lose jobs in this process to China.
[02:00:49.254 --> 02:00:50.275]  Mexico is a conduit.
[02:00:50.575 --> 02:00:51.536]  Mexico is a conduit.
[02:00:52.016 --> 02:00:53.237]  Mexico is a transit point.
[02:00:53.477 --> 02:01:05.645]  It goes cheap labor to move the transportation of these cheap goods, and Kansas City Southern says, oh no, we won't have Mexican train workers, we'll have United Transportation workers
[02:01:06.267 --> 02:01:21.293]  The railroads are already pressuring the United Transportation Union to reduce crews on the railroads running in the United States.
[02:01:21.954 --> 02:01:34.999]  So the pressure from the Mexican railroad workers is going to add fuel to lowering wages of UTU workers and to lowering the number of train men allowed on an individual train.
[02:01:36.136 --> 02:01:39.681]  It'll be a downward pressure on transportation wages across the continent.
[02:01:39.802 --> 02:01:44.969]  Oh, this is going to be good for everybody because it's going to just lower everybody's wages all over the place.
[02:01:46.792 --> 02:01:48.935]  You're talking about... Lots of cheap goods had to do...
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:50.901]  I had to go to Walmart.
[02:01:51.241 --> 02:01:52.001]  Yeah, I liked it too.
[02:01:52.041 --> 02:01:54.463]  Robert Pastner will tell you we're all consumers.
[02:01:54.643 --> 02:01:57.564]  Well, that's fine, but if we don't have any more money, we can't consume anything.
[02:01:57.724 --> 02:01:58.825]  Is he working for Walmart?
[02:02:00.025 --> 02:02:01.366]  I guess he could be.
[02:02:01.406 --> 02:02:02.847]  Does he own stock in Walmart?
[02:02:02.867 --> 02:02:03.187]  I don't know.
[02:02:03.247 --> 02:02:04.067]  I did ask him that.
[02:02:04.087 --> 02:02:07.969]  You know, this is not theoretical stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:07.989 --> 02:02:12.211]  I know that Senator John Cornyn earlier this year got caught with his pants down.
[02:02:12.231 --> 02:02:19.135]  Well, and we interviewed him from World Net Daily because Senator Cornyn introduced into Congress
[02:02:19.801 --> 02:02:26.331]  I believe it was S-3622, which was a bill to create the North American Investment Fund.
[02:02:26.351 --> 02:02:29.255]  Yeah, let's talk about that after this break.
[02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:29.736]  We'll be back.
[02:02:29.756 --> 02:02:33.802]  We're talking with Dr. Jerome Corsi about this insanity of the North American Union.
[02:02:46.431 --> 02:02:49.612]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:49.932 --> 02:02:51.853]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:52.253 --> 02:02:59.915]  Shockingly classified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:00.595 --> 02:03:07.658]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.038 --> 02:03:10.979]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:11.319 --> 02:03:13.680]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:14.940]  NSA spies.

[02:03:42.972 --> 02:03:48.053]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:48.113 --> 02:03:55.415]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:55.575 --> 02:04:06.177]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:06.397 --> 02:04:10.938]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:11.238 --> 02:04:16.221]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:04:16.441 --> 02:04:19.383]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.603 --> 02:04:29.408]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:04:43.573 --> 02:04:45.975]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:04:46.495 --> 02:04:49.817]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:04:50.177 --> 02:04:53.139]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:04:53.399 --> 02:04:59.763]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:04:59.843 --> 02:05:04.246]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:05:04.486 --> 02:05:08.848]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:05:09.008 --> 02:05:11.609]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:14.410]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:17.411]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:05:17.451 --> 02:05:21.713]  attack on Iran could result in China dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:05:21.753 --> 02:05:22.593]  Treasury bonds.
[02:05:22.873 --> 02:05:27.497]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.

[02:05:29.338 --> 02:05:31.540]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[02:05:44.562 --> 02:05:50.585]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:51.206 --> 02:05:54.227]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.929 --> 02:06:05.914]  Okay, once again, this is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones for the next couple of days, and we are honored to have Dr. Jerome Corsi as our guest.
[02:06:06.394 --> 02:06:14.018]  We're discussing the North American Union, which again is not a theory, it's not an academic exercise, it is happening right now,
[02:06:14.801 --> 02:06:23.283]  And we were just talking before the break about the fact that our own Texas Senator John Cornyn introduced a bill in the 109th Congress.
[02:06:23.343 --> 02:06:33.846]  It was Senate Bill 3622, which called for the development of this North American Investment Fund, which is exactly what Robert Pastor calls for, to the word.
[02:06:34.787 --> 02:06:42.389]  And the purpose of the fund was to create, improve infrastructure in Mexico.
[02:06:42.449 --> 02:06:42.909]  In other words,
[02:06:43.664 --> 02:07:03.937]  American taxpayers building the Mexican portion of the Trans-Texas Corridor, which is a subset of the NAFTA superhighway, so that the communist Chinese goods can get here better and quicker and faster, and so that the American people's descent into poverty can be cushioned.
[02:07:03.957 --> 02:07:06.418]  You know, Dr. Corsi, I'm not an economist.
[02:07:06.478 --> 02:07:07.559]  I'm just a regular old joe.
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:12.443]  You know, I run a true value hardware store in Austin, Texas.
[02:07:12.463 --> 02:07:13.464]  That's what I do for a living.
[02:07:14.444 --> 02:07:14.925]  Okay.
[02:07:15.045 --> 02:07:16.426]  You know, that's what I do.
[02:07:16.446 --> 02:07:18.548]  You know, I'm not a professional journalist.
[02:07:18.608 --> 02:07:19.188]  I've been paid.
[02:07:19.789 --> 02:07:22.631]  I was paid by the New American to go up to cover that conference in Waco.
[02:07:22.651 --> 02:07:26.454]  You know, they paid my hotel and a few bucks to write that article.
[02:07:26.794 --> 02:07:31.558]  But I'm not a professional journalist, but I can think, I can see, I can hear, you know.
[02:07:32.518 --> 02:07:36.902]  And this entire thing is obscene.
[02:07:38.639 --> 02:07:45.565]  Well, you know, the thinking starts as soon as you do what the globalists have done.
[02:07:45.745 --> 02:07:54.111]  As you cross the line over and you say, okay, look, we're going to now create a North American union, like a European union.
[02:07:54.171 --> 02:07:57.374]  They started this way back in George H.W.
[02:07:57.414 --> 02:08:00.396]  Bush's administration to really push it.
[02:08:00.917 --> 02:08:01.597]  Clinton signed it.
[02:08:01.637 --> 02:08:03.459]  It's been going on for some time.
[02:08:04.379 --> 02:08:07.462]  Once you start that thinking and once you start believing that
[02:08:08.177 --> 02:08:11.719]  World trade and globalism are going to solve all the problems of the world.
[02:08:12.459 --> 02:08:16.020]  And, you know, Robert Pasteur believes that.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:17.961]  A lot of the socialists believe that.
[02:08:17.981 --> 02:08:26.125]  And you get pressure from both sides because the unbridled capitalists just want the access to the cheap labor.
[02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:28.146]  They just want to make more money.
[02:08:28.986 --> 02:08:31.067]  More, you know, dollar bills.
[02:08:31.227 --> 02:08:32.387]  They want to make more billions.
[02:08:33.228 --> 02:08:34.828]  So Walmart doesn't care.
[02:08:34.888 --> 02:08:36.029]  Walmart is happy to take
[02:08:36.576 --> 02:08:38.317]  All their goods from communist China.
[02:08:38.817 --> 02:08:40.997]  They move into neighborhoods and shut down.
[02:08:41.017 --> 02:08:46.659]  They've gone all through communities all across the country into small towns, built a superstore.
[02:08:47.159 --> 02:08:50.720]  Pretty soon the hardware that's been there for three generations can't function anymore.
[02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:52.021]  It closes up.
[02:08:52.721 --> 02:08:54.081]  Everything closes up in the town.
[02:08:54.221 --> 02:08:55.602]  All you've got left is a superstore.
[02:08:55.642 --> 02:08:56.242]  They don't care.
[02:08:56.562 --> 02:09:02.864]  Well, the thing that I, this economic theory that I'm about to propose, even though I'm not an economist,
[02:09:03.607 --> 02:09:30.677]  It seems that the effect of all this in terms of as our standard of living slowly sinks into the West, as the wage scales go down, as America sinks slowly, slowly, slowly down so that our wage scales can more comfortably merge with those of the rest of the world, all this cheap Chinese communist stuff that's coming in is masking our descent.
[02:09:30.937 --> 02:09:31.797]  We can't tell it.
[02:09:32.492 --> 02:09:42.654]  You know, you used to go to the store and buy something for a dollar, and now you go there and buy it for 50 cents, some consumer goods, because it's coming from China, so you can't really tell.
[02:09:42.734 --> 02:09:46.435]  It's like a fake cushion on your descent.
[02:09:46.555 --> 02:09:48.335]  When you hit, it's going to really hurt.
[02:09:49.055 --> 02:09:49.856]  What do you think about that?
[02:09:50.396 --> 02:10:00.778]  I think, you know, certainly the whole idea that people are getting cheap goods at Walmart and other places is one of the things that's meant for people to say, hey, this is a good idea.
[02:10:02.096 --> 02:10:06.800]  And if people don't think very hard about it, sure, it's a great idea to be able to buy things cheap.
[02:10:07.441 --> 02:10:29.618]  When you start understanding that that's predicated on slaves or near slaves producing those goods, and the two lines to go on, they come to the same point, is A, that's morally wrong, and B, it's stupid economically because you undercut the employment here in the United States
[02:10:30.236 --> 02:10:32.737]  You close down manufacturing and you put people out of work.
[02:10:33.397 --> 02:10:39.220]  Now, labor and management are really not and should never consider themselves.
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:40.521]  I was raised in a labor family.
[02:10:40.581 --> 02:10:48.804]  My father was public relations director for the railroad trainmen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and he helped create the United Transportation Union.
[02:10:49.825 --> 02:10:56.408]  I remember this since I was a child, the discussions that labor and management are not enemies.
[02:10:57.669 --> 02:11:02.693]  Labor's got to make management strong in order for management to understand the value of labor.
[02:11:03.294 --> 02:11:04.555]  It's got to work both ways.
[02:11:05.416 --> 02:11:09.299]  One side's got to make sure the other side is also healthy.
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.203]  You can't win by destroying labor, and you can't win by destroying management.
[02:11:14.844 --> 02:11:21.289]  Now, if it's communist Chinese slaves, Walmart doesn't care because they're over there in China.
[02:11:21.329 --> 02:11:22.050]  Nobody sees them.
[02:11:22.090 --> 02:11:23.111]  It doesn't make any difference.
[02:11:23.131 --> 02:11:24.192]  It's China's problem.
[02:11:24.784 --> 02:11:28.146]  And if you object, they say, well, this helps China develop.
[02:11:28.166 --> 02:11:30.907]  It doesn't help China develop as a middle class.
[02:11:31.828 --> 02:11:41.993]  When these people who are slaves working in these factories get to be 20 years old, they fire them, put them out in the countryside, and get another 12-year-old or 13-year-old to work in that factory.
[02:11:42.693 --> 02:11:45.054]  Nobody ever saves anything working in those factories.
[02:11:45.735 --> 02:11:50.297]  It makes a few people, it will make China look just like Mexico.
[02:11:50.337 --> 02:11:54.459]  A few wealthy people and a few wealthy families, and they'll control the country.
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.481]  And the great masses will be poor.
[02:11:56.501 --> 02:11:58.381]  Well, the same thing will happen in the United States.
[02:11:58.401 --> 02:12:14.147]  In the United States, the people of this country who have depended upon manufacturing jobs virtually since the country was founded are going to find that they don't have those jobs anymore and there isn't anything else left except at very few, you know, small wages.
[02:12:14.907 --> 02:12:17.948]  Even our cars, nobody's made much of this.
[02:12:18.328 --> 02:12:22.670]  Detroit, General Motors, and Ford just closed down a huge set of plants
[02:12:23.177 --> 02:12:24.937]  And laid off thousands of workers.
[02:12:25.678 --> 02:12:32.279]  Now those workers are going to find that instead of $30 jobs, they're going to end up with $10 jobs if they can find one at all.
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:38.101]  And to get the $10 job, they're probably going to have to compete with an illegal immigrant that came through Mexico.
[02:12:39.581 --> 02:12:42.822]  Now, at that point, we don't have a middle class left.
[02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:49.664]  And about, you know, one more generation of this, when the cars are now going to be started to be made in China...
[02:12:50.205 --> 02:12:55.129]  And every one of the major car companies has gone to China to stake out a position.
[02:12:56.070 --> 02:13:06.598]  These container ships, to bring them in the container ships and put the cars in there, bring them in through the ships, and we won't need anything in the car industry in the United States except retail distribution.
[02:13:07.459 --> 02:13:13.024]  And the capitalists don't think far enough to care that there won't be a middle class left to buy those products.
[02:13:13.804 --> 02:13:17.067]  They figure that there'll be enough of a oligarchy left
[02:13:18.816 --> 02:13:19.957]  Goldman Sachs doesn't care.
[02:13:19.977 --> 02:13:24.321]  They're throwing a billion-dollar Christmas party this year, a multi-billion dollar.
[02:13:24.361 --> 02:13:25.742]  Everybody's getting huge bonuses.
[02:13:26.403 --> 02:13:40.755]  Well, that's because their hedge funds and the companies they've invested in in China, thanks to Treasury Secretary Paulson when he was there at Goldman Sachs, have been a good deal for those guys right now, even if they're closing down factories all over America.
[02:13:40.996 --> 02:13:42.557]  It's just a bad deal for the middle class.
[02:13:43.277 --> 02:13:46.200]  And the middle class is the backbone of America and always has been.
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:51.185]  So the target of all this, then, is the middle class.
[02:13:51.565 --> 02:13:56.530]  You're echoing the sentiments of... Lou Dobbs.
[02:13:57.311 --> 02:13:58.292]  Lou Dobbs on CNN.
[02:13:58.312 --> 02:13:59.113]  Lou Dobbs is right.
[02:13:59.553 --> 02:14:02.456]  And he has picked it up on CNN.
[02:14:03.177 --> 02:14:04.118]  And I put...
[02:14:05.214 --> 02:14:13.301]  I'm honored to have been on his show with Minutemen, The Battle to Secure America's Borders, and I strongly support the book he wrote on the end of the middle class.
[02:14:14.001 --> 02:14:15.943]  I've read that book, and I think it's an excellent book.
[02:14:16.744 --> 02:14:17.484]  And he's right.
[02:14:18.045 --> 02:14:22.508]  You know, the special interests have bought the politicians.
[02:14:23.529 --> 02:14:26.452]  And, you know, look at Bill Clinton.
[02:14:26.472 --> 02:14:27.532]  China bought Bill Clinton.
[02:14:28.173 --> 02:14:30.695]  There were campaign fundraising scandals.
[02:14:30.795 --> 02:14:32.957]  All the technology that's been shipped to China
[02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:35.311]  Bill Clinton started engineering.
[02:14:35.331 --> 02:14:41.875]  You've got to start asking, how did Hillary Clinton go from a $300,000 net worth to a $50 million net worth?
[02:14:42.355 --> 02:14:43.936]  And I'll give you two words that explain it.
[02:14:44.277 --> 02:14:45.197]  China and Dubai.
[02:14:46.018 --> 02:14:48.279]  Between the two of them, she became a multimillionaire.
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:57.985]  And if you don't think Hillary and Bill are still working together, they may not be man and wife, but they're sure making sure each other gets billions.
[02:14:59.266 --> 02:15:01.507]  Bill would sure like to be back in the White House, I guess.
[02:15:02.199 --> 02:15:06.041]  For all of you who think this is a Republican problem, you better wake up because it's not.
[02:15:06.681 --> 02:15:07.161]  It's not.
[02:15:07.241 --> 02:15:22.228]  The Democrats and the Republicans at the top of this heap are globalists, they're elitists, they're one-worlders, and both of them in concert are working to destroy the American middle class and to destroy the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:15:22.708 --> 02:15:24.649]  I'll write a story next week, Bob, when I show.
[02:15:24.749 --> 02:15:25.369]  I'm waiting until...
[02:15:26.167 --> 02:15:27.368]  Friday we get this report.
[02:15:27.388 --> 02:15:41.198]  I'll write a story and show that the financial report of the United States for 2006 shows the fact we're at least running the $3.5 trillion, with a T, dollar budget deficit, fiscal budget deficit this year.
[02:15:41.899 --> 02:15:46.803]  And I think that our negative net worth will now be closer to $60 billion instead of $50 billion.
[02:15:47.863 --> 02:15:53.868]  But I'll also show that all this idea that Clinton had surpluses, again, was accounting gimmicks.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:58.121]  That Clinton was running trillion-dollar deficits, too.
[02:15:58.821 --> 02:16:03.883]  And I'm going to go back and correct those years so people don't think that it was great under Clinton.
[02:16:04.303 --> 02:16:04.763]  It wasn't.
[02:16:04.863 --> 02:16:06.883]  He was deepening this problem.
[02:16:07.324 --> 02:16:08.904]  George Bush has deepened it further.
[02:16:08.924 --> 02:16:10.944]  It started with George H.W.
[02:16:10.985 --> 02:16:11.305]  Bush.
[02:16:11.905 --> 02:16:15.406]  I mean, it's gone on probably go back to Reagan.
[02:16:15.806 --> 02:16:23.668]  Reagan made a terrible decision in 1986 to allow that amnesty to be granted, and that was probably the beginning of the downward slope.
[02:16:24.841 --> 02:16:31.464]  Well, you know, it sounds like my friends at the Council on Foreign Relations have been very busy for decades.
[02:16:31.564 --> 02:16:32.665]  I wanted to ask you a question.
[02:16:32.685 --> 02:16:41.589]  I noticed that you joined forces in some sort of an agreement or some sort of a union with the John Birch Society.
[02:16:41.649 --> 02:16:42.870]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:16:43.410 --> 02:16:52.094]  Well, the John Birch Society asked me to come and give a keynote address to them at one of their council meetings in North Carolina, and I was happy to do that.
[02:16:53.948 --> 02:16:59.511]  I also, they've been publishing and writing in their magazine, The New American, following everything that I've been doing.
[02:16:59.611 --> 02:17:07.875]  So I think in this battle, they've been in the lead for years, saying that this North American Union was coming down the pike.
[02:17:08.815 --> 02:17:12.357]  I'll form alliances, as many as I can, to get this stopped.
[02:17:14.158 --> 02:17:17.582]  Well, I think that's excellent because the Burke Society is doing the same thing.
[02:17:17.622 --> 02:17:23.428]  They're reaching out to other Americans who are also trying to save this country.
[02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:27.953]  And we're going to save the rest of this conversation for after the break.
[02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:29.575]  We'll be back with Dr. Jerome Forsyth.
[02:17:40.071 --> 02:17:41.092]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[02:17:41.152 --> 02:17:41.693]  It's December 14, 2006.
[02:17:41.753 --> 02:17:45.597]  Golds at 627 and 1-ounce coins can be purchased for 647.70, 326.40 for half-ounce, and 163.20 for quarter-ounce coins at 647.70, 326.40, and 163.20.
[02:17:56.568 --> 02:18:09.438]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:18:09.578 --> 02:18:12.780]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:16.283]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:18:16.343 --> 02:18:19.285]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[02:18:19.545 --> 02:18:22.387]  Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document.
[02:18:22.467 --> 02:18:25.289]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:25.489 --> 02:18:27.691]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:18:27.851 --> 02:18:28.571]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:28.731 --> 02:18:34.695]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:34.715 --> 02:18:34.895]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:40.439 --> 02:18:48.684]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking a hot shower than when you drink the water?
[02:18:48.945 --> 02:18:53.287]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:18:53.588 --> 02:19:02.513]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:19:02.714 --> 02:19:06.336]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:19:06.616 --> 02:19:11.646]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:19:11.947 --> 02:19:18.660]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.791]  What about you?
[02:19:20.451 --> 02:19:25.816]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:19:25.876 --> 02:19:26.896]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:19:27.037 --> 02:19:28.858]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:19:40.865 --> 02:19:41.186]  Thank you.
[02:19:55.885 --> 02:19:56.286]  We're good to go.
[02:20:12.346 --> 02:20:12.506]  516-8736.
[02:20:12.686 --> 02:20:13.526]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:13.546 --> 02:20:17.247]  Just call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:17.307 --> 02:20:17.787]  It's free.
[02:20:17.847 --> 02:20:22.688]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:20:22.728 --> 02:20:22.968]  Music
[02:20:40.339 --> 02:20:42.601]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:20:42.621 --> 02:20:45.042]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:20:45.102 --> 02:20:49.625]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:20:50.206 --> 02:20:56.690]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:20:57.211 --> 02:21:09.319]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:21:09.839 --> 02:21:13.641]  Wrist Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:21:14.081 --> 02:21:20.164]  Wrist Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and makes a great stocking stuffer.
[02:21:20.584 --> 02:21:26.606]  Honest, Wrist Ease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[02:21:26.967 --> 02:21:29.828]  You can order Wrist Ease now at wristease.com.
[02:21:30.208 --> 02:21:36.491]  That's Wrist Ease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, wristease.com.
[02:21:36.631 --> 02:21:39.112]  Once again, wristease.com.
[02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:29.405]  Alright, this is Bob Dacey back with Dr. Jerome Corsi on the Alex Jones Show and we've been discussing the North American Union and the plans of our elitist friends to merge Canada, the United States and Mexico into one big happy slave country and we're going to be opening up the phone lines for questions to Dr. Corsi.
[02:22:29.445 --> 02:22:30.185]  The number is 1-800-259-9231
[02:22:35.165 --> 02:22:37.486]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:22:39.568 --> 02:22:46.532]  So after this segment, we're going to be taking calls for anyone who wants to discuss this with Dr. Jerome Corsini.
[02:22:46.552 --> 02:22:47.913]  The man knows what he's talking about.
[02:22:48.473 --> 02:22:51.916]  He has written extensively on this subject.
[02:22:52.736 --> 02:22:55.658]  You want to go to humaneventsonline.com.
[02:22:55.938 --> 02:22:57.939]  That's humaneventsonline.com.
[02:22:59.923 --> 02:23:02.744]  I think Dr. Corsi is the second author.
[02:23:02.784 --> 02:23:19.871]  When you click on the contributors button, just click on Jerome Corsi and you will find out the immense amount of work that this man has done exposing the North American Union for what it really is.
[02:23:20.412 --> 02:23:26.314]  Dr. Corsi, have you gotten any flack for this work you're doing?
[02:23:27.222 --> 02:23:38.170]  Well, I mean, you know, I get criticized on the Internet and other places by people who say that none of this is happening and it's all hysteria or an Internet conspiracy theory.
[02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:39.591]  None of that bothers me.
[02:23:39.611 --> 02:23:43.934]  I say if it's an Internet conspiracy theory, it's being conducted on government websites.
[02:23:44.714 --> 02:23:49.157]  Because you've got a security and prosperity partnership with SPT.gov.
[02:23:49.778 --> 02:23:52.300]  That whole website is maintained by the Department of Commerce.
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:55.562]  You've got the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:23:56.226 --> 02:23:59.308]  Well, go take a look at KeepTexasMoving.com.
[02:24:00.029 --> 02:24:02.471]  That's a Texas Department of Transportation website.
[02:24:03.312 --> 02:24:09.196]  I document this $3.5 trillion federal budget deficit today on WorldNetDaily.
[02:24:09.697 --> 02:24:14.941]  Well, I link to the federal government budget site that produces the report.
[02:24:15.501 --> 02:24:18.123]  So if you don't believe me, go read the federal report yourself.
[02:24:18.864 --> 02:24:23.848]  And that's, I think, what's made these articles convincing is that I've thoroughly linked them
[02:24:24.577 --> 02:24:28.521]  To the government reports that document that what I'm talking about is substantiated.
[02:24:28.681 --> 02:24:43.815]  Well, has anybody that actually has any financial authority over human events or World Net Daily or any of the publications that you write for said, Hey, Dr. Corsi, why don't you just shut up or something?
[02:24:43.835 --> 02:24:44.976]  Has anybody done anything like that?
[02:24:45.037 --> 02:24:45.637]  Absolutely not.
[02:24:45.657 --> 02:24:47.519]  I've been encouraged by both the editors.
[02:24:48.246 --> 02:24:52.767]  Joseph Farrow, who is the founder and publisher of WorldNet Daily, has been very supportive.
[02:24:53.508 --> 02:24:59.069]  Robert Bluey, who is the major editor I work with at Human Events, has been extremely supportive.
[02:24:59.890 --> 02:25:03.911]  I'm very close to the Human Events staff and to Regnery.
[02:25:05.051 --> 02:25:08.592]  Eagle Publishing is the parent of Human Events.
[02:25:08.652 --> 02:25:15.595]  I published with John O'Neill, Unfit for Command against John Kerry, which was a book published by Regnery.
[02:25:15.635 --> 02:25:16.555]  It was probably one of their
[02:25:17.168 --> 02:25:20.290]  Biggest selling books ever.
[02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:25.253]  I've gotten only support from the editors and publishers of the work I'm doing.
[02:25:25.813 --> 02:25:27.454]  I think, again, it's highly documented.
[02:25:27.494 --> 02:25:28.675]  It's all authenticated.
[02:25:29.495 --> 02:25:30.656]  None of this is made up.
[02:25:30.736 --> 02:25:35.939]  It's fully, fully in the public record or in interviews I've conducted that I've recorded and documented.
[02:25:36.159 --> 02:25:46.845]  If you want to see some more documentation, I'm wondering, and this is just right out of the cold here, are you familiar with the North American PPP 2006, the Infrastructure Finance Conference?
[02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:54.465]  I knew they had a PPP, which stands for the Personal Private Partnerships.
[02:25:54.565 --> 02:25:56.807]  Public Private Partnerships.
[02:25:57.247 --> 02:26:03.052]  They had one of those meetings cost almost $3,000 to attend.
[02:26:03.112 --> 02:26:04.934]  It was held at the Waldorf last year.
[02:26:05.114 --> 02:26:05.434]  Exactly.
[02:26:05.454 --> 02:26:07.476]  Are they planning another one, or is that the one you're referring to?
[02:26:07.496 --> 02:26:08.737]  This is the one I'm referring to.
[02:26:08.937 --> 02:26:10.618]  I'm looking at their lab for it.
[02:26:12.608 --> 02:26:16.732]  You people out there just think, oh, this is all nuts, we're just making this up.
[02:26:16.772 --> 02:26:23.238]  Just go to www.euromoneyseminars.com slash PPP.
[02:26:24.279 --> 02:26:28.803]  www.euromoneyseminars.com slash PPP.
[02:26:29.303 --> 02:26:32.046]  This is an ad for this conference they had last September.
[02:26:32.066 --> 02:26:33.407]  That's right.
[02:26:34.196 --> 02:26:35.457]  Absolutely vulgar.
[02:26:35.757 --> 02:26:38.578]  Well, just take a look at the investment banks that participated.
[02:26:38.619 --> 02:26:40.460]  I have that brochure right here somewhere.
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:42.821]  Yeah, you've got the Royal Bank of Scotland.
[02:26:42.841 --> 02:26:43.981]  Yeah, they're coming over here.
[02:26:44.001 --> 02:26:45.002]  Goldman Sachs.
[02:26:45.522 --> 02:26:45.822]  Yeah.
[02:26:47.724 --> 02:26:48.624]  Carlisle Group.
[02:26:49.284 --> 02:26:50.765]  And people are coming over here.
[02:26:51.265 --> 02:26:53.967]  These people have a seminar in New York.
[02:26:54.577 --> 02:26:59.498]  To teach foreign investors how to come carve up American infrastructure.
[02:26:59.938 --> 02:27:01.818]  Yeah, well, I just pulled that brochure right out.
[02:27:01.878 --> 02:27:02.678]  I mean, exactly.
[02:27:03.059 --> 02:27:04.519]  And look at the government participants.
[02:27:04.539 --> 02:27:05.379]  You have the U.S.
[02:27:05.399 --> 02:27:14.761]  Department of Transportation, the Department of Transportation of the various states, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Florida, Oregon, Alaska, Indiana.
[02:27:15.421 --> 02:27:19.141]  It's a wholesale sellout of our infrastructure and more.
[02:27:19.621 --> 02:27:22.562]  We'll be back after the break with Dr. Jerome Corsi, and we'll take a call.
[02:27:30.777 --> 02:27:31.678]  We're on the march.
[02:27:32.179 --> 02:27:33.781]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.702 --> 02:27:37.385]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:40.848 --> 02:27:42.508]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[02:27:42.588 --> 02:27:43.389]  What's wrong?
[02:27:43.409 --> 02:27:44.689]  I am so tired.
[02:27:44.749 --> 02:27:47.229]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[02:27:47.349 --> 02:27:48.430]  I have tried everything.
[02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:50.250]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[02:27:50.410 --> 02:27:51.550]  You name it, I've tried it.
[02:27:51.690 --> 02:27:53.991]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[02:27:54.151 --> 02:27:55.711]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[02:27:55.931 --> 02:27:57.991]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[02:27:58.091 --> 02:28:00.332]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[02:28:00.512 --> 02:28:01.032]  The what?
[02:28:01.292 --> 02:28:03.353]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[02:28:03.493 --> 02:28:08.834]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[02:28:09.014 --> 02:28:10.494]  You can see it at BedFan.com
[02:28:11.134 --> 02:28:12.274]  How well are you sleeping?
[02:28:12.494 --> 02:28:14.135]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[02:28:14.515 --> 02:28:18.836]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[02:30:50.382 --> 02:30:56.606]  Okay, Bob Basie back on the Alex Jones Show with Dr. Jerome Corsi talking about North American Union.
[02:30:57.107 --> 02:31:02.710]  Just before the break, we were talking about this North American PPP 2006 conference that was held in September.
[02:31:03.371 --> 02:31:04.872]  I want to read something from this thing.
[02:31:05.272 --> 02:31:09.835]  They talk about their agenda, and on the second day, they talk about this.
[02:31:10.596 --> 02:31:12.957]  New asset classes in PPP.
[02:31:13.417 --> 02:31:15.319]  How wide can the net be spread?
[02:31:15.999 --> 02:31:20.062]  Let's off-road P3 opportunities away from transportation.
[02:31:22.737 --> 02:31:28.838]  Water, waste, military accommodation, schools, prisons, municipal buildings.
[02:31:29.498 --> 02:31:33.839]  Dr. Corsi, these people plan on gobbling up everything.
[02:31:34.559 --> 02:31:39.500]  Well, the investment bank, first of all, you've got to realize there's so much U.S.
[02:31:40.061 --> 02:31:41.461]  cash that's gone overseas.
[02:31:42.121 --> 02:31:44.461]  They don't have someplace to spend it?
[02:31:45.082 --> 02:31:45.602]  Exactly.
[02:31:45.662 --> 02:31:51.643]  In other words, the only alternative, and we need to send more overseas all the time because the problem with this
[02:31:52.419 --> 02:31:55.341]  3.5 trillion dollar budget deficit.
[02:31:55.361 --> 02:31:56.742]  I'm not talking about a U.S.
[02:31:56.883 --> 02:31:57.163]  debt.
[02:31:57.743 --> 02:32:00.245]  This is an each year budget deficit.
[02:32:00.305 --> 02:32:04.448]  It's a shortfall each year of 3.5 trillion dollars in the budget.
[02:32:05.129 --> 02:32:07.250]  That's what this report just released.
[02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:08.612]  It's going to be released on Friday.
[02:32:08.632 --> 02:32:14.056]  It's a 2005 report documented for the 2005 fiscal federal budget.
[02:32:14.276 --> 02:32:15.317]  So it's each year.
[02:32:15.457 --> 02:32:17.318]  Trillions.
[02:32:17.979 --> 02:32:20.921]  Because what they don't do when they say the budget deficit is only
[02:32:21.648 --> 02:32:26.793]  $248 billion, which is what the Treasury has been saying, is that that's on a cash basis.
[02:32:27.433 --> 02:32:45.590]  When you do a gap accounting, which is generally accepted accounting principles, and you fully create the liabilities and account for them of Social Security and Medicare, they're just taking the Social Security money and spending it on the next obligation you've got, which is what the $248 billion deficit reflects.
[02:32:48.570 --> 02:32:53.051]  Now the new fully accounted deficit is $3.5 trillion.
[02:32:53.971 --> 02:32:57.892]  Now we have to finance that deficit.
[02:32:58.572 --> 02:33:03.333]  We end up selling Treasury securities into the foreign exchange market.
[02:33:03.913 --> 02:33:09.674]  So if China quits buying our Treasury securities, we can't finance our budget debt.
[02:33:09.974 --> 02:33:14.715]  So if I may put this in simple terms that hopefully people will understand.
[02:33:14.735 --> 02:33:15.915]  Tell me if you agree with this.
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:16.620]  Right.
[02:33:16.740 --> 02:33:38.450]  If you were to boil this down to someone's personal finances, it's akin to somebody who is spending way more money than he's earning, and so he puts a second mortgage up on his house in order to finance his deficit, and pretty soon they're going to foreclose on his house.
[02:33:39.111 --> 02:33:40.911]  Well, that's about right in personal terms.
[02:33:41.292 --> 02:33:46.054]  What it is is we're constantly borrowing, creating more debt,
[02:33:46.877 --> 02:33:53.220]  To handle current liabilities, to pay for things that the federal budget has promised to pay for today.
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:34:08.289]  And at the same time running a huge budget deficit, we're running a trade deficit to China under the Security and Prosperity Partnership in North America where we've just opened our markets, and the World Trade Organization where we've done it too.
[02:34:09.029 --> 02:34:16.353]  And now we've got five cabinet secretaries, Secretary Paulson, plus the head of the Federal Reserve,
[02:34:17.003 --> 02:34:17.443]  Sounds good.
[02:34:17.483 --> 02:34:18.004]  Sounds good.
[02:34:45.919 --> 02:34:59.766]  But they're going to take a whole set of public water projects, all the water facilities in the cities and towns, schools, prisons, hospitals, you name it, and they'll sell it to the foreign investors.
[02:34:59.806 --> 02:35:02.987]  They'll all be owned by somebody else, foreigners.
[02:35:03.047 --> 02:35:08.450]  And this is stuff that we the taxpayers have already paid for, and now they're going to sell it to a bunch of foreigners.
[02:35:08.650 --> 02:35:09.271]  America, you better wake up.
[02:35:12.702 --> 02:35:26.669]  And then they're going to let Hutchinson Wampoa, a communist Chinese firm that manages ports with close ties to the Chinese military, they're going to let them manage the ports in Mexico through which these goods come.
[02:35:27.149 --> 02:35:35.093]  And NASCO, the trade organization, the NASCO Super Corridors in Dallas, they're going to do a deal with Lockheed Martin.
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:46.248]  And a subsidiary owned by 49% by Hutchins and Wampoa to put the sensors all up and down the Nazca corridor to know where the trucks and trains are carrying these Chinese goods.
[02:35:46.408 --> 02:35:47.629]  Boy, I feel safer already.
[02:35:48.109 --> 02:35:52.873]  I'm saying you might as well let a couple of Chinese gunboats come on up to Mississippi.
[02:35:53.453 --> 02:35:54.294]  Who's going to stop them?
[02:35:54.494 --> 02:35:56.916]  They'll probably own the Mississippi by the time they sail off it.
[02:35:57.076 --> 02:35:58.237]  Well, talk about fair play.
[02:35:58.257 --> 02:36:00.719]  That's what the British did to the Chinese back a long time ago.
[02:36:01.437 --> 02:36:02.637]  And I don't think the Chinese forgot.
[02:36:03.777 --> 02:36:04.378]  I guess not.
[02:36:04.778 --> 02:36:07.258]  We're going to take some calls here, Dr. Corsi, if you don't mind.
[02:36:07.378 --> 02:36:07.678]  We'll see.
[02:36:08.138 --> 02:36:10.699]  First up, we have Fred in Philadelphia.
[02:36:10.779 --> 02:36:13.259]  Fred, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:13.599 --> 02:36:13.899]  Welcome.
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:16.500]  Fred, are you there?
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:17.760]  Hi, Bob.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:18.920]  What's going on?
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:24.841]  Hey, I'm just listening with rapt attention to this show.
[02:36:24.861 --> 02:36:25.362]  I think that...
[02:36:28.758 --> 02:36:37.443]  One of the things that comes up in my mind is that we're getting a constant stream of government statements.
[02:36:37.663 --> 02:36:40.625]  What constitutes truth by the government?
[02:36:40.785 --> 02:36:51.150]  How do we screen out basically the falsehoods by the government?
[02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:55.693]  Also, could you comment about the Constitution?
[02:36:57.310 --> 02:37:13.540]  As a way to screen out all these false statements and what do we do as we run through our daily lives to basically have a better perspective on all of this?
[02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:15.301]  Dr. Corsi, you want to tackle that?
[02:37:15.681 --> 02:37:22.786]  Well, the Bush administration is operating in complete contradiction to and disregard for the Constitution.
[02:37:23.846 --> 02:37:25.107]  I've been urging Congress
[02:37:25.751 --> 02:37:42.601]  To demand hearings on SPP, Security and Prosperity Partnership, because according to the Constitution, we shouldn't be harmonizing and integrating our laws with two foreign nations, Mexico and Canada, in bureaucratic meetings that are being held behind closed doors of the
[02:37:43.745 --> 02:37:50.150]  And even if we could, I might add, even if we could do that, it wouldn't be the executive branch.
[02:37:50.270 --> 02:37:53.252]  You've got to have legislation to do that, even if you could do it.
[02:37:53.552 --> 02:37:55.373]  Or a treaty should be... Or a treaty.
[02:37:55.694 --> 02:37:59.997]  The legislative branch has to be involved, right?
[02:38:00.277 --> 02:38:02.398]  Even NAFTA is not a two-thirds vote of the Senate.
[02:38:02.458 --> 02:38:03.619]  NAFTA should have been a treaty.
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:06.221]  NAFTA itself is unconstitutional.
[02:38:06.241 --> 02:38:07.042]  It's just a law.
[02:38:08.062 --> 02:38:10.264]  And it should not have been passed by one vote.
[02:38:10.984 --> 02:38:14.349]  I mean, it should have been a treaty that demanded a two-thirds vote of the Senate.
[02:38:14.930 --> 02:38:17.374]  They knew they couldn't do that, so they slipped it in as a law.
[02:38:17.394 --> 02:38:19.217]  It's again a disregard of the Constitution.
[02:38:20.551 --> 02:38:26.856]  So the Constitution, like George Bush is quoted as having said, the Oval Office is just evidently to have a G.D.
[02:38:26.896 --> 02:38:27.477]  piece of paper.
[02:38:27.537 --> 02:38:28.398]  That's what he said.
[02:38:28.778 --> 02:38:29.999]  He was quoted as saying that.
[02:38:30.299 --> 02:38:34.342]  And I hate to have to add this because I just kind of call it like it is.
[02:38:34.903 --> 02:38:47.633]  If you took an oath to swear and protect and defend this country and this Constitution before you became president, and if the Constitution itself requires that you take that oath before you can become president, and if you break that oath,
[02:38:48.234 --> 02:38:54.997]  So viciously, and so repeatedly, and so obviously, you don't have any business being the president, and you should be out of there.
[02:38:55.077 --> 02:38:58.218]  I mean, you're talking about constitutional remedy?
[02:38:58.278 --> 02:39:04.461]  Well, there's something called impeachment, and there's something called treason, and I think the two go hand in hand.
[02:39:04.981 --> 02:39:16.726]  Well, certainly treason is a high crime and misdemeanor, and the problem is that the Democrats are the ones who should be all over this, and should be out there representing the people.
[02:39:16.766 --> 02:39:17.326]  They say that the
[02:39:17.932 --> 02:39:19.593]  The people are their constituency.
[02:39:19.993 --> 02:39:26.156]  Yeah, but John Conyers... They're paid by the same groups that are paying the Republicans.
[02:39:26.357 --> 02:39:27.517]  Yeah, unfortunately that's true.
[02:39:27.577 --> 02:39:41.044]  John Conyers was making motions about looking into all this nasty, unconstitutional rights-robbing stuff Bush was doing several months ago, and now that the Democrats have the House of Representatives, he said, well, never mind, don't worry about that.
[02:39:41.305 --> 02:39:47.548]  The only thing they want to expose the Republicans on is Foley writing...
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:48.320]  Yes.
[02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:56.204]  I just wanted to say that could you tell me who was basically fighting the fight in the 90s over the truth about the annual deficit?
[02:39:56.224 --> 02:40:01.446]  There was a female expert and one male expert that were predominant, especially on the Internet.
[02:40:18.146 --> 02:40:24.328]  And yet they were basically squashed and not allowed to get the story out.
[02:40:24.708 --> 02:40:28.689]  There was no one in Congress that was fighting that fight.
[02:40:28.909 --> 02:40:35.031]  There was no one in the government, but there were two independent people that were well-known that I remember.
[02:40:35.091 --> 02:40:36.071]  I don't remember by name.
[02:40:36.091 --> 02:40:40.153]  Do you remember who knew the truth about that in the 90s?
[02:40:40.593 --> 02:40:44.194]  I've been reading it for years, but this was the first time when I...
[02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:55.192]  I got a hold of... The report I have published today in WorldNetDaily, when I got a hold of John Williams, whose blog I cite, he's an econometrician.
[02:40:55.232 --> 02:41:02.873]  He writes an extremely good analysis in this shadow government statistics is his blog.
[02:41:02.893 --> 02:41:06.634]  If you take a look at WorldNetDaily... Is that the site?
[02:41:06.734 --> 02:41:09.895]  I'll give you the exact site here in a second.
[02:41:10.295 --> 02:41:10.735]  But if you...
[02:41:11.938 --> 02:41:13.699]  He has documented it.
[02:41:13.819 --> 02:41:21.222]  He did the analysis of these reports called the Financial Report of the United States, which will be issued on Friday.
[02:41:22.263 --> 02:41:30.507]  Shadow Government Statistics, by the way, their Internet site is www.shadowstats.com.
[02:41:30.767 --> 02:41:35.589]  S-H-A-D-O-W-S-T-A-T-S dot com.
[02:41:35.709 --> 02:41:37.310]  All one word, shadowstats.com.
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:56.323]  And John Williams had done the analysis, and I interviewed John, and so finally I had a federal government report that I could analyze with an expert who was willing to make the argument with me that we have a $3.5 trillion deficit.
[02:41:56.403 --> 02:41:58.864]  I demand that much proof in things I write.
[02:41:58.904 --> 02:42:05.705]  I mean, I have to have a government document before or some authoritative expert on the record.
[02:42:06.331 --> 02:42:11.112]  Before I go ahead and write these things, because I'm not interested in conspiracy theories.
[02:42:11.172 --> 02:42:11.832]  I want facts.
[02:42:12.012 --> 02:42:15.393]  Okay, so we're going to go to shadowstats.com.
[02:42:16.253 --> 02:42:17.333]  Thank you for the call, Fred.
[02:42:17.833 --> 02:42:21.794]  We've also got John in Missouri up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:21.854 --> 02:42:22.574]  John, are you there?
[02:42:22.934 --> 02:42:23.394]  Yeah, Bob.
[02:42:23.434 --> 02:42:23.974]  How's it going?
[02:42:24.654 --> 02:42:25.294]  I don't know.
[02:42:25.314 --> 02:42:26.835]  It sounds like we're going down to two.
[02:42:26.855 --> 02:42:31.796]  Hey, I've got a couple of statements and a question.
[02:42:32.036 --> 02:42:32.876]  Actually, two questions.
[02:42:34.713 --> 02:42:39.137]  My son recently started school in northwest Missouri State, up above St.
[02:42:39.157 --> 02:42:39.397]  Joe.
[02:42:40.378 --> 02:42:43.560]  And I took him up there back in August to go to his dorm.
[02:42:44.301 --> 02:42:51.306]  And I noticed on I-29, just about the airport, KCI, there is a sign that says Mexican Free Trade Zone.
[02:42:52.007 --> 02:42:52.507]  Yeah, right.
[02:42:52.648 --> 02:42:53.608]  And that stuck with me.
[02:42:53.909 --> 02:42:55.510]  I was like, what in the heck is that?
[02:42:56.310 --> 02:43:00.514]  And now listening to you guys talk here, I realize what it is now.
[02:43:01.187 --> 02:43:06.009]  And does that remove all the taxes we would require for the trade going through there?
[02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.869]  That's right.
[02:43:07.089 --> 02:43:12.391]  And Mexico plans with a customs office in Kansas City in their smart port.
[02:43:13.252 --> 02:43:15.413]  Kansas City has gone about Mexican crazy.
[02:43:15.433 --> 02:43:24.456]  They think they're going to make a lot of money in the Mexican goods through Kansas City because they view themselves as an east and west point as well as north and south for the railroads.
[02:43:25.336 --> 02:43:26.677]  I've got news for Kansas City.
[02:43:26.697 --> 02:43:29.158]  They're not going to make nearly as much money as they think they're going to make.
[02:43:29.952 --> 02:43:30.092]  Yes.
[02:43:30.152 --> 02:43:30.553]  Absolutely.
[02:43:30.573 --> 02:43:30.953]  Absolutely.
[02:43:53.777 --> 02:43:54.498]  I've got news for you.
[02:43:54.598 --> 02:43:57.520]  Nobody makes money working with Mexico except Mexico.
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:03.823]  And even in Mexico you don't make it unless you're one of the drug dealers or one of the families that got control.
[02:44:05.444 --> 02:44:09.887]  I was working for Caterpillar in the 90s as I watched this whole thing roll upon us.
[02:44:10.928 --> 02:44:19.833]  And in 92 I had an engineer we were discussing NAFTA and I had an engineer, a senior engineer trying to explain it to us and he gave it to us this way.
[02:44:20.393 --> 02:44:21.774]  He said what that is out to do is
[02:44:22.631 --> 02:44:28.174]  Well, there's a tremendous resentment about the United States and our standard of living.
[02:44:28.194 --> 02:44:28.314]  Oh, yes.
[02:44:28.334 --> 02:44:28.714]  There has been.
[02:44:28.734 --> 02:44:32.696]  And people think the best solution to it is to destroy it, rather than have other countries replicate it.
[02:44:32.716 --> 02:44:32.816]  Sure.
[02:44:32.856 --> 02:44:32.996]  We have...
[02:44:52.014 --> 02:44:53.775]  Several things that are unique in the United States.
[02:44:53.875 --> 02:44:58.038]  Our rights are inalienable, not given by the communist government.
[02:44:58.318 --> 02:44:59.239]  Absolutely.
[02:44:59.299 --> 02:45:11.626]  Secondly, you know, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights did set out a structure of checks and balances that are designed to preserve liberty and to encourage private enterprise and to develop a middle class.
[02:45:12.347 --> 02:45:20.432]  And like Abraham Lincoln said, we are unique in experiment, which Lincoln did not know whether it would long endure, and I don't know if it will now long endure.
[02:45:21.688 --> 02:45:28.493]  It's a unique government structure that gave power to the middle class, to the people.
[02:45:28.833 --> 02:45:34.197]  Every other government ever formed in the history of the world gave power to the elites, and the elites are meaning to take it back.
[02:45:34.861 --> 02:45:38.363]  What we're talking about here is government of the elite, by the elite, for the elite.
[02:45:38.883 --> 02:45:41.605]  It'll make the whole world look like Mexico economically.
[02:45:41.625 --> 02:45:43.946]  John in Missouri, I want to thank you very much for that call.
[02:45:44.026 --> 02:45:46.448]  I want to completely agree with what you just said.
[02:45:47.949 --> 02:45:54.092]  If these people get their way, there's just going to be this third big giant third world country.
[02:45:54.772 --> 02:46:00.876]  It's going to be one big third world country and there's going to be a rich elite sitting on top of all the rest of it.
[02:46:01.276 --> 02:46:02.437]  In that third world country...
[02:46:03.075 --> 02:46:05.660]  Nobody working at Goldman Sachs thinks they'll be on the bottom.
[02:46:06.381 --> 02:46:08.405]  They'll be the ones with the billion dollar bonuses.
[02:46:08.425 --> 02:46:10.188]  You don't think any of this is going to affect them.
[02:46:10.208 --> 02:46:16.239]  That's because I kind of believe a lot of these academic types, they live in this academic bubble.
[02:46:16.877 --> 02:46:22.942]  Where they, you know, they got a degree in whatever and they think they're all smart and they hob-dob with each other and they're experts in their field.
[02:46:22.962 --> 02:46:24.964]  Also, a lot of money being made here.
[02:46:25.224 --> 02:46:25.424]  Yeah.
[02:46:25.444 --> 02:46:27.586]  There's a lot of speaking fees being paid here.
[02:46:27.726 --> 02:46:28.867]  And public repairs.
[02:46:28.887 --> 02:46:34.411]  People are making money and so are the investment bankers and so are the capitalists who are owning these companies.
[02:46:34.431 --> 02:46:37.153]  The stock market's having a huge party right now.
[02:46:37.173 --> 02:46:41.557]  And it's having that party while the yield curve is inverted.
[02:46:42.077 --> 02:46:44.339]  Long-term rates are lower than short-term rates.
[02:46:44.359 --> 02:46:46.481]  That usually precedes a recession.
[02:46:46.963 --> 02:46:53.187]  The housing market's about to have a bubble that's going to burst, and the dollar is slipping in value.
[02:46:54.268 --> 02:47:02.113]  But yet the stock market's having a wild party, because M3, the liquidity's never been higher, the money's rolling, and the champagne is flowing.
[02:47:02.353 --> 02:47:03.714]  And then they're going to have a hangover.
[02:47:04.415 --> 02:47:07.617]  Well, go back and read the financial press of the 1920s.
[02:47:07.677 --> 02:47:09.998]  It's about the same.
[02:47:11.179 --> 02:47:14.281]  Okay, we have another caller up, John from Michigan.
[02:47:14.341 --> 02:47:16.623]  John here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.156 --> 02:47:18.497]  Okay, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:47:18.597 --> 02:47:19.378]  I'm Mr. Crossey.
[02:47:19.398 --> 02:47:21.039]  I've been listening to you all over the radio.
[02:47:21.079 --> 02:47:22.801]  I'm trying to get you on the radio up here.
[02:47:23.301 --> 02:47:25.463]  Just send me an email.
[02:47:25.503 --> 02:47:26.304]  My email is easy.
[02:47:26.344 --> 02:47:29.146]  It's jcorssey at worldnetdaily.com.
[02:47:29.166 --> 02:47:29.607]  Okay.
[02:47:29.667 --> 02:47:34.631]  The links that's there on World Net Daily work, and I get those emails and I read them.
[02:47:35.352 --> 02:47:38.074]  jcorssey at worldnetdaily.com.
[02:47:38.694 --> 02:47:42.578]  Okay, and another thing, this not only is going to bring all these...
[02:47:43.473 --> 02:47:49.896]  And immigrants and cheap goods, but isn't there a plan to totally eliminate our Constitution and go to a world court system?
[02:47:50.176 --> 02:47:50.836]  Well, of course.
[02:47:50.896 --> 02:47:52.397]  I mean, that's the whole issue here.
[02:47:52.437 --> 02:48:10.745]  We've already got NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals, and those tribunals, which is informal structure, not even any rules as to how they're to be conducted, they can hold... If an investor wants to sue a state or the federal government of the United States because, let's say, an environmental law is detrimental to their business interests,
[02:48:11.292 --> 02:48:12.272]  I'm going to leave you.
[02:48:12.292 --> 02:48:13.133]  I'm going to leave you.
[02:48:43.559 --> 02:48:46.720]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:49.021]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:49.381 --> 02:48:57.044]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:57.724 --> 02:49:04.787]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.167 --> 02:49:08.128]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[02:49:08.509 --> 02:49:10.830]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:11.230 --> 02:49:12.070]  NSA spies.
[02:49:13.487 --> 02:49:16.589]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:49:16.909 --> 02:49:20.432]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:20.872 --> 02:49:22.794]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.134 --> 02:49:27.057]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:40.345 --> 02:49:42.186]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:49:42.527 --> 02:49:44.048]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:49:44.468 --> 02:49:44.708]  What?
[02:49:45.069 --> 02:49:45.429]  Again?
[02:49:45.849 --> 02:49:47.471]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:49:47.551 --> 02:49:51.974]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[02:49:52.214 --> 02:49:53.495]  Why did you do that?
[02:49:53.715 --> 02:49:59.500]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:00.841]  Are we there yet?
[02:50:00.941 --> 02:50:02.002]  for the entire trip.
[02:50:02.262 --> 02:50:04.404]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:50:04.918 --> 02:50:05.919]  Great idea!
[02:50:05.939 --> 02:50:08.840]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:16.225]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:50:16.505 --> 02:50:16.825]  Honey!
[02:50:17.645 --> 02:50:18.886]  You're terrific!
[02:50:19.286 --> 02:50:20.767]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:50:20.867 --> 02:50:24.289]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:50:24.569 --> 02:50:25.350]  Now, can we stop?
[02:50:25.850 --> 02:50:26.591]  I need to go, too.
[02:50:26.891 --> 02:50:31.334]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:19.492 --> 02:51:20.032]  We're good to go.
[02:51:49.346 --> 02:51:53.269]  Okay, we're back for the final segment on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:53.309 --> 02:51:58.432]  This is Bob Dacey substituting for Alex Jones, and we are once again talking to Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:51:59.053 --> 02:52:08.279]  Dr. Corsi, before I take the next caller, I'd like to ask you exactly how does one get a hold of your book, Minutemen, The Battle to Secure America's Borders?
[02:52:08.840 --> 02:52:09.600]  Thank you for asking.
[02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:11.962]  It's available on Amazon.com.
[02:52:12.582 --> 02:52:18.006]  If you'll just look up my name, C-O-R-S-I, Corsi, and I co-authored it with Jim Gilchrist.
[02:52:18.886 --> 02:52:21.987]  And I'll soon be writing a book on the North American Union.
[02:52:22.027 --> 02:52:28.170]  I'm trying to finish it by the... I have most of it written in December, and I'll finish it up in January.
[02:52:28.330 --> 02:52:29.971]  You better hurry up before it's too late.
[02:52:30.451 --> 02:52:33.692]  No, this stuff's going to be fought on for a good deal of time yet.
[02:52:33.752 --> 02:52:35.293]  This is not going to go away quick.
[02:52:35.493 --> 02:52:38.634]  Yeah, and that's why we have to be in this fight for a long, long time.
[02:52:38.734 --> 02:52:40.775]  Okay, we've got Dave from Canada up.
[02:52:41.215 --> 02:52:42.176]  Dave, are you there?
[02:52:42.996 --> 02:52:44.337]  Bob, hello, Mr. Corsi.
[02:52:44.357 --> 02:52:44.857]  How's it going?
[02:52:45.236 --> 02:52:45.977]  Good, thank you.
[02:52:46.397 --> 02:52:46.757]  Excellent.
[02:52:46.797 --> 02:52:47.878]  I have a question for both of you.
[02:52:47.938 --> 02:52:53.103]  I think it was Bob that made the statement that the Chinese was the other partner with the NAFTA agreement.
[02:52:54.163 --> 02:52:58.027]  Was that because North America was importing goods from China through Mexico?
[02:52:58.587 --> 02:53:00.409]  Yeah, they're just the beneficiary of it all.
[02:53:00.449 --> 02:53:02.831]  I mean, they didn't sign any agreement.
[02:53:02.851 --> 02:53:07.654]  They're just using Mexico as a conduit to bring all their slave goods into the United States.
[02:53:07.755 --> 02:53:10.797]  Okay, so it literally was shipping through Mexico into North America.
[02:53:10.817 --> 02:53:10.917]  Right.
[02:53:10.997 --> 02:53:14.240]  It's one of the ironies of things that, you know, the
[02:53:14.878 --> 02:53:18.861]  The signatories, of course, in NAFTA were the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
[02:53:19.421 --> 02:53:34.473]  But having opened up the markets to free trade and then the World Trade Organization opening things up with China, what happened is that even the jobs, the low-cost jobs in China started getting shipped to Mexico as well as our manufacturing jobs.
[02:53:35.109 --> 02:53:48.242]  And China just decided to start opening up Mexico as a transit port to get the containers in here cheaper, rather than bringing them all in on the West Coast and having to lug them across the United States with U.S.
[02:53:48.322 --> 02:53:51.164]  labor costs and unions being involved.
[02:53:51.645 --> 02:53:55.548]  Did Mexico have a tariff imposed on Chinese goods at the time?
[02:53:55.629 --> 02:53:59.172]  Mexico itself has been reducing tariffs with China.
[02:53:59.816 --> 02:54:02.517]  And Mexico's also swamped with Chinese goods.
[02:54:02.857 --> 02:54:04.897]  They're complaining about this down in Mexico, too.
[02:54:05.477 --> 02:54:10.078]  And Mexico's lost a huge number of jobs, manufacturing jobs, to China.
[02:54:10.098 --> 02:54:18.539]  I mean, the maquiladoras, the sweatshop assembly plants in the 90s, at the height of NAFTA, employed about 3 million people.
[02:54:19.079 --> 02:54:22.080]  Today, as best I can figure, they employ about 1 million people.
[02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:24.540]  Two-thirds of those jobs have gone to China.
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:28.301]  It's one of the reasons there's additional pressure from all the
[02:54:28.977 --> 02:54:29.697]  I think so.
[02:54:50.086 --> 02:55:00.290]  Well, I'm just wondering if the people of this country who are citizens who are being affected by all of the legislation and the way that the government is selling all the waterways and roadways and things...
[02:55:20.785 --> 02:55:30.273]  I wondered if any of the citizens of the United States realized this is basically the same government that treated the natives of this land that way to begin with.
[02:55:32.155 --> 02:55:33.075]  Yeah, I guess so.
[02:55:33.636 --> 02:55:44.005]  Well, the point is, rather than going back and settling things that happened 200 years ago or 150 years ago, I think we've got to deal with this problem right now.
[02:55:45.086 --> 02:55:46.507]  This problem is going to increase.
[02:55:47.136 --> 02:55:48.897]  And America, you've got to wake up to this.
[02:55:48.917 --> 02:55:51.399]  We're really just about out of time here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:56:02.796 --> 02:56:03.656]  This is Bob Dacey.
[02:56:03.696 --> 02:56:10.039]  I want to remind you, if you want to learn about this, go to www.jbs.org and learn all about the American Union.
[02:56:10.059 --> 02:56:12.840]  Because let me tell you something, you've got to do something about this.
[02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:14.260]  It's not going away.
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:16.321]  They're coming at us from all angles.
[02:56:16.921 --> 02:56:18.001]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:56:18.022 --> 02:56:18.842]  This is Bob Dacey.
[02:56:18.862 --> 02:56:20.222]  Dr. Corky, thank you for being here.
