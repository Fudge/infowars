[00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:06.319]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.020]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.861]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.322]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:12.983]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:17.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:21.969]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:27.773]  It's already Thursday.
[00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:31.996]  The ninth day of March, 2006.
[00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:35.846]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.127]  We'll be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:41.328]  Dr. John Breeding has never been in studio with me.
[00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:46.390]  He's been on as a guest via telephone many times, but he's another Austinite like myself.
[00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:47.713]  Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:47.753 --> 00:00:48.174]  We're good to go.
[00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:16.982]  Any award-winning documentary filmmaker, I mean, they'll let the most small, petty, nothing film show at South by Southwest.
[00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:25.429]  It's really a joke here in Austin, just a way to bilk artists out of their money run by the Jabba the Hutt creature, Louis Black, who owns the Chronicle.
[00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.352]  But they won't even allow this film to be shown at South by Southwest.
[00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:30.713]  No, we don't want that.
[00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:31.534]  It's political.
[00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:33.556]  No, we don't want that shown here.
[00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:35.897]  But it will be shown in Austin, and Dr. Breeding's involved with it.
[00:01:36.178 --> 00:01:37.219]  Tomorrow we have...
[00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:42.217]  A lady confessions of an RX dealer.
[00:01:42.237 --> 00:01:47.819]  And then, of course, the award-winning director joining us both in studio.
[00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:51.040]  They're going to be here in town next week showing the film.
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.061]  Heard them on Jack Blood yesterday.
[00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:56.161]  I just had to get them in studio since they're going to be here in town.
[00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:57.102]  That is coming up.
[00:01:57.122 --> 00:01:59.703]  So, Dr. Breeding, in the second hour.
[00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:01.423]  In the third hour, Bush impeachment.
[00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:04.044]  David Swanson and Dan DeWalt.
[00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:18.689]  And they are all over the country moving to get different states to go forward with the impeachment of George W. Bush, the Cunningham Port, Maine, phony Texan.
[00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:25.452]  So we'll spend a little bit of time with them in the third hour as well coming up.
[00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.571]  In the meantime, there is a lot of just amazing news to cover.
[00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:37.513]  China to issue 1.3 billion RFID identification cards.
[00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:43.934]  Now, the United States is now issuing 300 million of these to the Real ID Act.
[00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:51.156]  So exactly the same things happening in China are happening here, are happening in England, are happening in Germany, are happening everywhere.
[00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:53.557]  It is the global control grid.
[00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:58.754]  Also, I ran war about ethnic cleansing, not oil bourse.
[00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:05.658]  That's Paul Watson's headline, and I would agree with him that predominantly it's about global hegemony, not so much about the oil bourse.
[00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:18.184]  But that's hand-in-glove with having total domination, so no one can have their own trading systems for petrodollars or energy or corn and gold, any basic commodity.
[00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:20.845]  So we'll get into that.
[00:03:20.905 --> 00:03:31.050]  The war drums for war with Iran are really intensifying right now, and they've got some of the new lies for old, and some of the old lies are being retreaded yet again.
[00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.112]  Big neocon lie concerning deadly EMP weapon.
[00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.353]  We've talked about this in the past.
[00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:41.135]  Now Paul Watson has put another article out on that subject.
[00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.636]  Arizona governor orders troops to the border.
[00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:47.638]  Is it just cosmetic, or is she really trying to do something?
[00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:52.270]  And we'll also, of course, be taking your calls.
[00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.691]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:54.871]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:54.971 --> 00:04:03.417]  And first-time callers are always welcome.
[00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.218]  Long-time callers are welcome as well.
[00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:05.999]  We don't screen the calls.
[00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.081]  We just ask your first name and what state you are calling from.
[00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:18.147]  Now, the websites, of course, are Infowars.com, Infowars.com.
[00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:25.302]  .net JonesReport.com We've now updated and redesigned that site.
[00:04:25.502 --> 00:04:27.183]  Being updated daily, be sure and check it out.
[00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:39.973]  PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv And incidentally, we have a new super special on the yearly subscriptions for PrisonPlanet.tv where you get all of our materials.
[00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:48.440]  The audio interviews, all my films, a bunch of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, weekly TV show, in-studio interviews, video interviews,
[00:04:49.838 --> 00:04:51.080]  Five plus months.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.346]  Almost half a year free in the month of March, the spring special, when you sign up.
[00:04:55.747 --> 00:04:57.229]  Sign up before this deal's gone.
[00:04:58.411 --> 00:04:59.032]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.052 --> 00:04:59.553]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:02.992]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.192 --> 00:05:06.273]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.413 --> 00:05:10.315]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.355 --> 00:05:14.596]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.937 --> 00:05:18.698]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.778 --> 00:05:20.639]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.922]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:32.104]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:32.284 --> 00:05:35.165]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:41.748]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.288 --> 00:05:44.391]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:10.992]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.232 --> 00:06:20.238]  Black murky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:20.858]  We're good to go.
[00:06:35.623 --> 00:06:42.427]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.707 --> 00:06:44.468]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.748 --> 00:06:46.789]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.890]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.931]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:51.391]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:53.312]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.695 --> 00:07:05.596]  Did you know you could be punishing your diesel engine if you don't use a diesel fuel conditioner in the winter?
[00:07:05.616 --> 00:07:12.058]  Winter conditions don't just call for an anti-gel, but a host of additives, as diesels have trouble in the winter, especially when idling.
[00:07:12.638 --> 00:07:19.619]  SFR Diesel, with its multifunctional additive package, prevents soot buildup, maximizes performance, and improves mileage.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.541]  If you want to run longer, run stronger, use SFR Diesel diesel fuel conditioner.
[00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:30.042]  Call 888-USE-SFR-1 for a store near you.
[00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:33.588]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:07:34.068 --> 00:07:35.989]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.850]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:46.973]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:07:47.753 --> 00:07:49.954]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:07:50.334 --> 00:07:50.774]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:52.255]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:05.948 --> 00:08:06.588]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.248 --> 00:08:08.349]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:10.209]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.610]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.191]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.592]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.113 --> 00:08:22.234]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:27.996]  We're seeing a...
[00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:42.406]  Scientifically executed repeat of the exact same propaganda used three years ago on the eve of the invasion of the peaceful, innocent country of Iraq.
[00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:48.389]  All the same demonization, all the same propaganda.
[00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:53.752]  And now we see them going after Iran.
[00:08:54.173 --> 00:08:55.453]  We'll be covering that today.
[00:08:57.557 --> 00:08:58.478]  I think we're good to go.
[00:09:10.439 --> 00:09:11.279]  With several guests.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:19.763]  And we'll also get into what's happening with moves to impeach President Bush at the state level to get that ball rolling.
[00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:30.707]  And there's also state legislatures that are now moving to pass laws to not allow the federalization of the state driver's license for the national ID card.
[00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:34.909]  Oh, they can pass federal laws saying we get national ID cards.
[00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:39.331]  They can pass federal laws saying for psychological testing and drugging of the American people.
[00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:42.483]  But let's see them try to implement it at the state level.
[00:09:42.523 --> 00:09:46.304]  If we simply get involved, they don't have a snowball chance in Hades.
[00:09:46.824 --> 00:10:08.708]  But before I do that, I want to read this article written a few days ago by Chuck Baldwin, because the anniversary of the Alamo siege has come and passed, come and gone, and it's just as important as Lexington or Concord or what happened at Bunker Hill or at Trenton, New Jersey.
[00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:16.510]  And so I want to just spend a few minutes and read this article before I get into all the world news and cover what's happening here domestically as well.
[00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.550]  This is by Chuck Baldwin.
[00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.672]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:10:21.113 --> 00:10:24.236]  Alamo heroes appear foolish today.
[00:10:24.616 --> 00:10:32.923]  It is that time of year for me to remind my readers about the magnificent stand by the defenders of the Alamo back in 1836.
[00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:37.705]  The Alamo fell on March 6th of that year.
[00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:47.196]  For more than 13 days, 186 brave and determined patriots withstood Santa Ana's seasoned army of 5,000 troops.
[00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:53.825]  To a man the defenders of that mission fort knew they would never leave those ramparts alive.
[00:10:54.835 --> 00:10:55.335]  We're good to go.
[00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:30.599]  Stout-hearted men such as Davy Crockett, a nationally known frontiersman and former congressman, Will Travis, only 23 years old, a little boy, a little baby boy at home, and Jim Bowie, a wealthy landowner with properties on both sides of the Rio Grande, really existed.
[00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:31.635]  We're good to go.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.444]  Liberty is an easy word to say, but it is a hard word to live up to.
[00:11:54.924 --> 00:11:58.928]  Freedom has little to do with financial gain or personal pleasure.
[00:11:59.508 --> 00:12:04.693]  Accompanying freedom is her constant and unattractive companion responsibility.
[00:12:05.193 --> 00:12:07.415]  Neither is she an only child.
[00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:10.698]  Patriotism and morality are her sisters.
[00:12:11.198 --> 00:12:15.062]  They are inseparable, destroy one, and all will die.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.364]  Early in the siege, Travis wrote these words to the people of Texas.
[00:12:20.925 --> 00:12:27.331]  Fellow citizens and compatriots, I am besieged by thousands of Mexicans under Santa Ana.
[00:12:27.952 --> 00:12:32.116]  The enemy has determined a surrender at discretion.
[00:12:32.276 --> 00:12:35.039]  Otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword.
[00:12:36.057 --> 00:12:40.180]  As you read these words, remember that Travis and the others did not have the ACLU PETA
[00:12:56.596 --> 00:13:05.262]  And people from the Un-American Way and the National Education Association telling them how intolerant and narrow-minded their notions of honor and patriotism were.
[00:13:05.862 --> 00:13:11.326]  A hostile media did not constantly castigate them as a bunch of wild-eyed extremists.
[00:13:11.886 --> 00:13:16.910]  As school children, they were not taught that their forefathers were nothing more than racist jerks.
[00:13:17.515 --> 00:13:25.560]  The brave men at the Alamo labored under the belief that America and Texas really was the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:33.705]  They believed God was on their side and that the freedom of future generations depended on their courage and resolve.
[00:13:34.205 --> 00:13:40.970]  They further believed that posterity would remember their sacrifice as an act of love and devotion.
[00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.871]  It all looks pale now.
[00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:46.833]  By today's standards, the gallant men of the Alamo appear rather foolish.
[00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:49.075]  After all, they had no chance of winning.
[00:13:49.435 --> 00:13:49.755]  None.
[00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:56.279]  However, the call for a pragmatism and practicality was never sounded.
[00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:00.502]  Instead, they answered the clarion call, victory or death.
[00:14:01.302 --> 00:14:02.103]  And in closing...
[00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:11.060]  Please try to remember the heroes of the Alamo as you listen to your gutless political and religious leaders calling for compromise and tolerance.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:19.973]  Try to recall the time in this country when ordinary men and women had the courage of their convictions and were willing to sacrifice their lives for freedom and independence.
[00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:22.221]  One thing is certain.
[00:14:22.602 --> 00:14:29.925]  Those courageous champions did not die for a political party or for some lesser of two evils mantra.
[00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:31.805]  They fought and died for principle.
[00:14:32.185 --> 00:14:34.346]  So did the men at Lexington and Concord.
[00:14:34.686 --> 00:14:38.828]  This is our heritage, our birthright, my friends.
[00:14:38.988 --> 00:14:44.250]  And on second thought, don't they look foolish or do we look foolish?
[00:14:45.771 --> 00:14:48.232]  And I flummoxed that there at the end.
[00:14:48.292 --> 00:14:50.713]  On second thought, do they look foolish or do we?
[00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:53.160]  Not a newsreader, folks, like Peter Jennings.
[00:14:56.659 --> 00:14:58.480]  I just want to set the stage with that.
[00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:22.536]  And understand that when you have an attitude that you're willing to fight and die, you're not going to be pushed around or shoved around, you get left alone, you have liberty, and then you're able to produce plenty, and then you become happy, and then your children become decadent, their children become even more decadent, their children become cross and corrupt and evil, and then you get tyranny, and then you go right through the cycle again if you're lucky.
[00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:28.506]  Normally the cycle isn't broken and you just live in abject slavery and tyranny and countries fail.
[00:15:28.526 --> 00:15:31.188]  They're not productive or powerful or well known.
[00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:41.236]  The real empires of the world were forged through a zenith, through a genesis, through a beginning of liberty.
[00:15:41.696 --> 00:15:43.618]  At least more liberty than their neighbors.
[00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:46.740]  It didn't matter what color they were or what culture they were.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:52.485]  Where there is liberty, there is freedom, there is happiness, there is productivity.
[00:15:52.965 --> 00:16:03.273]  Where there is a centralized, controlling elite, you have civilizations going into rapid decline and then complete destruction and complete breakdown.
[00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:07.016]  But the elite are threatened by individuals.
[00:16:07.036 --> 00:16:08.337]  They are threatened by independence.
[00:16:08.357 --> 00:16:09.558]  They are threatened by happiness.
[00:16:09.578 --> 00:16:10.919]  They are threatened by the family.
[00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:14.362]  And that's why they're openly trying to dismantle it right now.
[00:16:14.382 --> 00:16:22.308]  And the Republican and Democratic parties are controlled by the very same social architects, the big think tanks that are doing this for their banker masters.
[00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:39.456]  So it's time to throw off the left-right paradigm, to realize we're all in this together as humans, and to realize that any centralization of government, whether it's under some left hood or some right hood, that is whatever hat you put on it, it is still the same creature.
[00:16:39.517 --> 00:16:43.158]  And centralization allows corrupt elites to dominate and control.
[00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:44.978]  The answer is decentralization.
[00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:49.020]  We must bind the lesser...
[00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.312]  Areas of human nature.
[00:16:52.372 --> 00:16:55.416]  We must restrict the dark impulses.
[00:16:56.017 --> 00:17:00.223]  And to deny them is to invite certain ruin.
[00:17:02.326 --> 00:17:03.227]  Alright, um...
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.663]  Let me just get into some other important news now.
[00:17:06.723 --> 00:17:07.924]  This is by Paul Watson.
[00:17:08.584 --> 00:17:11.867]  Iran's deadly EMV weapon, latest neocon war fraud.
[00:17:11.887 --> 00:17:16.031]  They've been pushing this for a while, but they're really pushing it right now, hitting a crescendo.
[00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:20.956]  Apocalyptic twaddle mirrors Saddam's imaginary biodrones.
[00:17:22.097 --> 00:17:24.379]  From the same snake oil salesman,
[00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:36.556]  That brought you 45-minute attack claims, dodgy dossiers, and weapons bunkers that were bakeries, comes the shocking new threat that could knock America back into the Stone Age.
[00:17:36.596 --> 00:17:37.156]  That's her quote.
[00:17:37.597 --> 00:17:39.837]  Iran's deadly EMP weapons.
[00:17:41.338 --> 00:17:43.959]  Our government just detonated hundreds in the atmosphere and it didn't do that.
[00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:44.780]  It doesn't do that.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.280]  It's a type.
[00:17:45.899 --> 00:18:00.449]  Fox, CBN News, World Net Daily, and others are running from the hills in a Y2K style in their madcap efforts to warn the American people that we must strike Iran before they unleash the apocalyptic fury of EMP.
[00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:12.278]  CBN reports, one national security expert calls it the mega threat you haven't heard of, but America's enemies know all too well about the destructive potential of an electromagnetic pulse attack.
[00:18:13.996 --> 00:18:20.360]  And it goes, In the hit film, Ocean's Eleven, thieves use it to shut down the city of Las Vegas.
[00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:26.004]  In last summer's War of the Worlds, the alien invaders used it to cripple the Earth's infrastructure.
[00:18:26.304 --> 00:18:37.032]  So just like Bush gives the speech talking about the Liberty Tower that doesn't exist, it's called Library Tower, and then they cut to video of aliens blowing up the building from Independence Day back in the mid-90s, well...
[00:18:37.998 --> 00:18:41.180]  CBS cut to Ocean's Eleven and to War of the Worlds.
[00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:48.566]  And so they mixed in George Clooney and space aliens and... What's that other individual's name?
[00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.947]  I'm having one of those mental blocks here that was in War of the Worlds.
[00:18:50.987 --> 00:18:51.628]  Tom Cruise.
[00:18:51.928 --> 00:18:53.950]  I mean, literally, this is what they cut to.
[00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.312]  They may have EMP nukes to get us!
[00:18:57.632 --> 00:18:59.834]  And they cut to space aliens blowing up cities.
[00:19:01.442 --> 00:19:03.127]  This is pure psyop.
[00:19:03.589 --> 00:19:08.885]  This is pure War of the Worlds, literal War of the Worlds, conditioning to try to create a panic.
[00:19:09.705 --> 00:19:12.886]  I mean, just like Orson Welles could go on the air and read H.G.
[00:19:12.926 --> 00:19:23.049]  Wells' War of the Worlds and even have a disclaimer saying it wasn't real, there was total panic, people dying in car wrecks, running, screaming, fires all over the East Coast.
[00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:24.850]  The aliens!
[00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:30.832]  Well, now they just show aliens attacking and say Iran's going to get you while they're playing video of aliens blowing stuff up.
[00:19:31.392 --> 00:19:42.016]  I mean, they must, their scientific psychological warfare technicians must think they've really dumbed the general public down to now constantly have space aliens attacking, mixing it in with Iran.
[00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:46.518]  I mean, that's the level of mindlessness we've reached here.
[00:19:48.499 --> 00:19:50.140]  And I hear the public, they're going to get us.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.261]  Iran, I'm just worried about them, Alex.
[00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:55.122]  I know our government's corrupt, but Iran's going to get us.
[00:19:55.142 --> 00:19:57.863]  They've got EMP bombs!
[00:20:02.319 --> 00:20:08.684]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:13.929]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:14.249 --> 00:20:22.156]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:22.316 --> 00:20:29.362]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.763]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:30.923 --> 00:20:34.305]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:34.365 --> 00:20:35.485]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:20:35.786 --> 00:20:37.046]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:20:37.247 --> 00:20:44.070]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:07.060]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.341]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:22:09.581 --> 00:22:16.703]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:22:16.823 --> 00:22:28.347]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:22:28.687 --> 00:22:29.328]  We're good to go.
[00:22:29.388 --> 00:22:30.068]  We're good to go.

[00:23:52.747 --> 00:23:53.608]  We don't need no education.
[00:23:53.628 --> 00:23:55.309]  All right, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:23:55.369 --> 00:23:57.070]  We don't need any thought control.
[00:24:11.593 --> 00:24:14.054]  No dark sarcasms in the classroom.
[00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:14.735]  Hey, teacher.
[00:24:14.755 --> 00:24:15.615]  Hey, brainwasher.
[00:24:15.935 --> 00:24:17.916]  Leave the general population alone.
[00:24:18.436 --> 00:24:19.877]  So what are the teachers doing?
[00:24:19.897 --> 00:24:21.358]  What are the brainwashers doing?
[00:24:21.378 --> 00:24:22.758]  What are the social engineers doing?
[00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:26.220]  All over television, they say terrorists are going to attack you.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.021]  They've got these weapons.
[00:24:28.601 --> 00:24:31.262]  And then they cut to space aliens blowing up U.S.
[00:24:31.282 --> 00:24:32.603]  cities, flying saucers.
[00:24:33.664 --> 00:24:35.264]  And that is War of the Worlds.
[00:24:35.344 --> 00:24:38.626]  We know that was a psychological warfare test, Tavistock Institute.
[00:24:39.689 --> 00:24:41.990]  With Orson Welles carrying it out for H.G.
[00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:42.390]  Wells.
[00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.750]  I even got an interview they did on KTSA.
[00:24:45.671 --> 00:24:47.971]  Years after they staged their operation.
[00:24:48.031 --> 00:24:50.032]  Years later, giving an interview here in San Antonio.
[00:24:50.512 --> 00:24:51.972]  Just south of me where I sit in Austin.
[00:24:52.792 --> 00:24:54.653]  And psychological warfare operation.
[00:24:54.673 --> 00:24:56.433]  Government involved to test it out.
[00:24:57.193 --> 00:24:59.094]  And they said aliens are attacking, they're killing us.
[00:24:59.354 --> 00:25:00.814]  And the people panicked and freaked out.
[00:25:01.255 --> 00:25:03.235]  They know it's these base fears.
[00:25:03.315 --> 00:25:07.036]  It'd be just like if they showed a clip from Jaws eating you.
[00:25:08.195 --> 00:25:14.282]  Eating someone and cut to Iran's leader and said he wants to eat you this way too.
[00:25:14.702 --> 00:25:19.427]  You just laugh, but it would still create that psychological emotion of fear.
[00:25:19.948 --> 00:25:28.337]  In fact, it's like the more classical subliminals of flashing violent images or scary images of predators trying to affect our lower brain cells.
[00:25:30.025 --> 00:25:31.847]  Sinners, they do that.
[00:25:32.307 --> 00:25:33.228]  There's lots of that.
[00:25:33.348 --> 00:25:48.222]  Or in that gray or red or blue background you see on the news, it's been admitted that they add subliminal text and things that your subconscious mind picks up so that you then have an emotional response but are not conscious of it.
[00:25:48.663 --> 00:25:49.764]  This is all admitted.
[00:25:49.804 --> 00:25:51.806]  This is taught at major universities.
[00:25:51.846 --> 00:25:52.646]  This is not hidden.
[00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:54.248]  This is going on.
[00:25:55.126 --> 00:26:06.800]  And so now they've just moved into aliens blowing up cities and War of the Worlds clips and then cutting back to Iran saying they might have EMP, they might use it on us.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.621]  Well, number one,
[00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:16.972]  The Army out in Arizona and Nevada and other areas detonated, I forget exactly how many, but in some nights it was like 20, 30.
[00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:28.662]  It was a great Discovery Channel piece I saw years ago about it where it would show them at different areas of the atmosphere firing high-powered hydrogen missiles.
[00:26:29.202 --> 00:26:36.047]  Missiles carrying hydrogen warheads, hydrogen bombs, much more powerful than A-bombs, up into different layers of the atmosphere.
[00:26:36.108 --> 00:26:41.992]  And yeah, a few radios would blow up in Guatemala or in Dallas, Texas.
[00:26:43.033 --> 00:26:44.914]  There'd be a few satellite glitches.
[00:26:45.475 --> 00:26:46.055]  It's nothing.
[00:26:46.175 --> 00:26:48.137]  EMP is made up, folks.
[00:26:48.257 --> 00:26:49.738]  EMP is a joke.
[00:26:50.365 --> 00:26:54.889]  Now, do the globalists have super bombs they could detonate, perhaps, with computer models?
[00:26:55.089 --> 00:26:58.552]  Do they know the exact place to detonate one that could really cause major problems?
[00:26:58.572 --> 00:26:59.393]  I'm sure they do.
[00:27:00.654 --> 00:27:11.322]  When a nuke goes off in an airburst over, let's say, over the city of Austin, let's say a big hydrogen warhead goes off, let's say 5,000 feet over Austin, because you don't want it to crater.
[00:27:11.342 --> 00:27:19.029]  You want to have that big blast wave flash of heat and radiation to destroy the entire city, which it would do.
[00:27:19.964 --> 00:27:21.345]  A good-sized weapon would do that.
[00:27:22.326 --> 00:27:24.608]  Then it would also EMP surrounding towns.
[00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:28.552]  It would EMP, but only for 100 miles or so.
[00:27:29.112 --> 00:27:32.235]  See, it doesn't work like that, but I've got CBS News, all of them.
[00:27:32.455 --> 00:27:33.776]  We will be in the Stone Age.
[00:27:33.936 --> 00:27:35.377]  Everything will be destroyed.
[00:27:35.718 --> 00:27:37.319]  Every component will be destroyed.
[00:27:37.619 --> 00:27:38.860]  They've probably got it.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.442]  Let's cut to what it would look like.
[00:27:40.842 --> 00:27:46.507]  And they cut to tripod aliens, giant alien attack craft blowing up New York.
[00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:57.640]  And that whole movie is scenes of cutting... It'll show a shot of an Arab in New York, his face, and then it'll cut to dust all over everyone, and people's pictures hanging up on walls.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.863]  And then Spielberg admitted it was to bring up images of 9-11.
[00:28:02.384 --> 00:28:08.689]  You see, it's just like... This is such incredible psychological warfare.
[00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:09.930]  It is so obvious.
[00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:16.455]  Bush gives a speech, and within four minutes, Fox News has images of the tower...
[00:28:17.367 --> 00:28:20.368]  That he mentioned being blown up by aliens.
[00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:22.729]  And then now this.
[00:28:22.989 --> 00:28:25.290]  Now this latest bit of propaganda.
[00:28:26.751 --> 00:28:30.113]  By the way, Bush called it the Liberty Tower.
[00:28:30.173 --> 00:28:31.653]  It's never been called the Liberty Tower.
[00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:33.534]  It's not named the Liberty Tower.
[00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:34.574]  No one's called it.
[00:28:34.614 --> 00:28:39.336]  But I guarantee you, Rove just said, Listen, liberty has a better effect in people's brains.
[00:28:39.357 --> 00:28:40.057]  You've heard his speeches.
[00:28:40.077 --> 00:28:42.998]  Well, he'll say liberty 35 times, tyranny 20-something times.
[00:28:43.398 --> 00:28:44.999]  Liberty versus tyranny over and over again.
[00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:46.311]  They liked it.
[00:28:46.432 --> 00:28:47.653]  Liberty's being attacked.
[00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:48.433]  It's symbolic.
[00:28:48.473 --> 00:28:49.194]  It's subconscious.
[00:28:49.214 --> 00:28:50.495]  It doesn't matter if it's not named that.
[00:28:50.535 --> 00:28:51.295]  They're so dumb.
[00:28:52.836 --> 00:28:54.758]  Our people at Fox are ready with the images.
[00:28:54.818 --> 00:28:56.359]  You just call it Liberty Tower.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.781]  Doesn't matter if it's called Library Tower.
[00:28:59.181 --> 00:29:01.763]  The news then began calling it Liberty Tower.
[00:29:01.843 --> 00:29:04.125]  Okay, the emperor renames the building.
[00:29:04.385 --> 00:29:05.186]  They didn't even question it.
[00:29:05.506 --> 00:29:06.787]  This building is Liberty Tower.
[00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:11.010]  How did they, within four minutes at Fox, know when he's using a wrong name?
[00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:12.912]  Not showing pictures of it.
[00:29:14.582 --> 00:29:18.447]  Did they know to go find the real name, go pull the real video, and then play it?
[00:29:18.587 --> 00:29:19.928]  See, they were all waiting.
[00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:23.472]  But this latest one is even more obvious.
[00:29:24.113 --> 00:29:29.880]  They have space aliens blowing up our city with EMP bombs, cutting back to Iran.
[00:29:31.673 --> 00:29:38.379]  And at an emotional level, with Mama sitting there cooking dinner, or Daddy doing whatever he's doing, carrying out the trash, and the TV's on the background.
[00:29:38.419 --> 00:29:39.440]  Huh?
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.801]  Iran's got EMP.
[00:29:40.821 --> 00:29:48.708]  You turn to the TV screen, and there's aliens blowing up cities, and we all have this subconscious fear of the outsider attacking us.
[00:29:49.229 --> 00:29:49.989]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.811 --> 00:29:52.732]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.212 --> 00:29:54.834]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.734 --> 00:29:58.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.796 --> 00:31:05.697]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.917 --> 00:31:11.358]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.638 --> 00:31:22.000]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.501]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.701 --> 00:31:35.064]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:31:35.324 --> 00:31:41.687]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and fowl taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:31:41.807 --> 00:31:46.268]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:46.508 --> 00:31:50.710]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:55.412]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:56.612 --> 00:31:56.652]  803-4438.

[00:32:01.553 --> 00:32:06.014]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:32:06.254 --> 00:32:09.855]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:18.137]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:32:18.377 --> 00:32:23.998]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:32:24.318 --> 00:32:29.541]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:32:29.821 --> 00:32:31.902]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[00:32:32.162 --> 00:32:44.328]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:48.973]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:32:49.193 --> 00:32:50.155]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:51.957]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:32:52.077 --> 00:32:53.879]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:54.600]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:54.820]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:05.291]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:07.292]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.793 --> 00:33:10.535]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:14.438]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.538 --> 00:33:15.739]  Got a report right here.
[00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:17.981]  They still do some good.
[00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:23.646]  And I have linked through to the proposed rule changes in California and confirmed that it is accurate.
[00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:24.767]  It's on WorldNetDaily.
[00:33:25.227 --> 00:33:28.110]  Mom, Dad to be axed from school textbooks.
[00:33:29.128 --> 00:33:33.972]  And there's a move to not allow the name mother or father, mom, dad in textbooks.
[00:33:33.992 --> 00:33:37.015]  They're saying it's hateful and very abusive, makes people feel bad.
[00:33:37.675 --> 00:33:40.277]  You see, it isn't just that people, quote, want equity.
[00:33:40.398 --> 00:33:43.240]  They want to destroy the existing forms.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.982]  They want to force us to live the way they do.
[00:33:46.423 --> 00:33:47.523]  That's the big rub.
[00:33:47.644 --> 00:33:48.524]  That's the problem.
[00:33:48.825 --> 00:33:51.046]  It isn't just, oh, we're here to live in peace.
[00:33:51.126 --> 00:33:55.150]  We want to just be nice to us, not with the radicals that are in control.
[00:33:57.106 --> 00:34:02.569]  And there's a lot of liberals out there who need to realize this and understand this isn't your values and go against it.
[00:34:02.589 --> 00:34:08.392]  You know, your party has been hijacked, just like the Republicans have been hijacked by a bunch of neocon criminals.
[00:34:08.412 --> 00:34:10.153]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:34:11.827 --> 00:34:16.828]  And it will also make the children have unisex toilets, which are very destructive, very bad.
[00:34:16.848 --> 00:34:30.371]  I mean, I have run in in trendy restaurants, and I've even been having my hair cut at one of these fancy salons before because my regular place was busy, the little corner place I go to, where an old man cuts your hair in five minutes for $5.
[00:34:31.391 --> 00:34:35.472]  And you try to go to the bathroom, and it's unisex, and you're in there, and there's women in the bathroom.
[00:34:35.772 --> 00:34:38.153]  Hey, man, I don't want to be around women in the bathroom!
[00:34:39.272 --> 00:34:41.193]  And it's not because I'm old-fashioned or weird.
[00:34:41.233 --> 00:34:43.253]  That's how humans operate and how humans behave.
[00:34:43.653 --> 00:34:47.394]  Women don't want to be in the bathroom with a man.
[00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:51.415]  And then all over the country, they're putting cameras in the bathrooms under federal grants.
[00:34:51.895 --> 00:34:53.196]  I just thought I'd mention this.
[00:34:53.256 --> 00:34:56.136]  Another reason to get your children out of public schools.
[00:34:56.176 --> 00:34:57.657]  These rule changes are going through.
[00:34:58.997 --> 00:35:00.317]  Mom and Dad is now evil.
[00:35:00.597 --> 00:35:06.199]  Did you know if you say the word homosexual, heterosexual, it's a scientific term.
[00:35:08.662 --> 00:35:13.406]  In England, and the government decides that it was meant as a slur, you are arrested.
[00:35:14.707 --> 00:35:15.707]  You are arrested.
[00:35:17.008 --> 00:35:18.489]  Now, I mean, think about that.
[00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:19.490]  Think about that.
[00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:24.153]  Think about this attack on free speech, how far it's gone.
[00:35:25.654 --> 00:35:30.118]  Remember Robin Page, the big BBC reporter for 20 plus years?
[00:35:31.098 --> 00:35:31.999]  By the way, a liberal journalist.
[00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:44.421]  And he's out there at a rural rights meeting that was being televised, and he said, farmers deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[00:35:45.655 --> 00:35:46.896]  Wasn't even derogatory.
[00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:48.297]  Just, we deserve the same rights.
[00:35:48.757 --> 00:35:49.178]  Boom.
[00:35:49.418 --> 00:35:49.938]  Arrested.
[00:35:49.978 --> 00:35:52.840]  We had him on this show, and it was in the British News.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.901]  Arrested.
[00:35:54.461 --> 00:35:55.362]  Arrested.
[00:35:55.842 --> 00:35:57.443]  They have raids every week.
[00:35:57.543 --> 00:35:59.785]  Headline, hundreds arrested in hate sweep.
[00:36:00.165 --> 00:36:02.607]  And it's, well, the neighbor heard them say a racial slur.
[00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:07.390]  This is the new America.
[00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.631]  This is happening in the U.S.
[00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:09.152]  as well.
[00:36:10.072 --> 00:36:15.016]  Let me continue with a really scary article, because the same thing's happening here, but it doesn't make headlines.
[00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:23.709]  China to issue 1.3 billion RFID identification cards for every citizen in their nation.
[00:36:24.989 --> 00:36:36.992]  China's Ministry of Public Security, which oversees the country's police force, Ministry of Controlling the Slaves, which oversees the country's police force, plans to issue more than 1.3 billion second-generation
[00:36:37.817 --> 00:36:44.659]  Resident identification cards based on RFID chips, according to industry analyst at ISAT China.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:58.804]  Based on the number of new cards to be issued, the rollout represents one of the largest RFID projects in the world, according to Anthony Zining, research director at ISAT China.
[00:36:58.825 --> 00:36:59.605]  Now let me stop you.
[00:36:59.985 --> 00:37:02.706]  There's another mainstream news article today.
[00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:10.677]  Where the company that is doing this for China is doing it with the national ID card and the passport here in America.
[00:37:13.038 --> 00:37:17.159]  Now, see, that isn't in... Either article doesn't point out the other story.
[00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:18.120]  That's what we do here.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:25.042]  We show this sickening web of control and how the very same company does work for the Chinese secret police.
[00:37:26.554 --> 00:37:27.475]  It's global, folks.
[00:37:27.775 --> 00:37:35.199]  A deal was made with China in the early 70s to work with the globalists in a mercantile scheme to de-industrialize the U.S.
[00:37:35.459 --> 00:37:36.960]  with select global companies.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.380]  China is the model.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.841]  I mean, they kill newborn babies.
[00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:43.063]  They have mobile execution vans, 24 of them in one city.
[00:37:43.683 --> 00:37:45.564]  They run around murdering whoever they want.
[00:37:45.964 --> 00:37:49.846]  Liberal, conservative, Falun Gong, Christian.
[00:37:49.946 --> 00:37:51.327]  It is hell on earth.
[00:37:52.588 --> 00:37:52.928]  Okay?
[00:37:53.775 --> 00:38:00.481]  And they go murdering farmers en masse and they won't give up their ancestral lands where they live on subsistence level for chemical plants.
[00:38:00.521 --> 00:38:05.666]  They machine gun them in the streets by the hundreds and it barely even makes our news now because our government loves it.
[00:38:06.827 --> 00:38:13.613]  You see, this is how, I mean, it's 11th hour, boys and girls, and China is more out of control than ever.
[00:38:14.234 --> 00:38:15.195]  And the globalists love it.
[00:38:16.076 --> 00:38:18.398]  And again, I watch CFR on C-SPAN routinely.
[00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:23.061]  I'll get a tip from a listener that, hey, CFR is going to be on TV tomorrow night.
[00:38:23.081 --> 00:38:24.082]  I'll tune into it.
[00:38:24.122 --> 00:38:25.563]  Our listeners always send us tapes of it.
[00:38:25.963 --> 00:38:26.683]  Boom, right there.
[00:38:26.723 --> 00:38:27.504]  China is the model.
[00:38:27.544 --> 00:38:28.264]  They're taking over.
[00:38:29.005 --> 00:38:30.005]  All power to them.
[00:38:30.125 --> 00:38:32.347]  They are the global model of the New World Order.
[00:38:32.607 --> 00:38:36.269]  We're going to use China to leverage out all competition and force them to the New World Order.
[00:38:36.609 --> 00:38:39.090]  They also use Walmart, and they use the Defense Department.
[00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:39.891]  You go, what do you mean?
[00:38:40.501 --> 00:38:49.818]  They use the buying power of the Defense Department and Walmart to force all retailers to adopt RFID and to force all distributors and manufacturers to adopt it.
[00:38:50.118 --> 00:38:51.521]  That was in USA Today four years ago.
[00:38:52.671 --> 00:38:53.252]  We're good to go.
[00:39:12.939 --> 00:39:15.580]  I'm told it's gone to 46, but I haven't confirmed that.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.121]  44 of the 100 economies are not governments or corporations.
[00:39:19.421 --> 00:39:32.265]  They've gone in, they're paying off politicians to sign governments over to them, and they've got to deal with China, Walmart, and the Defense Department to leverage out everybody else and force everyone onto their systems.
[00:39:33.905 --> 00:39:38.967]  It is racketeering by every yardstick of tyranny.
[00:39:40.089 --> 00:39:41.771]  It is the classic racketeering.
[00:39:41.791 --> 00:39:46.875]  They're teaming up in an oligopoly to perfect a monopoly of control.
[00:39:48.417 --> 00:39:52.280]  And so here it is, trying to issue 1.3 billion ID cards with RFID in them.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.361]  Now, what happened last year?
[00:39:53.742 --> 00:40:03.711]  Bush, right around this time last year, signed, got passed, the Real ID Act, which is a national ID card, which by law, by 2008, most states already have it,
[00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:14.943]  A RFID chip, by law, with a face scan, that's a digital photo, and a thumbprint or handprint, all three of those are put onto the ID card.
[00:40:15.244 --> 00:40:17.727]  Texas was doing this in 93, one of the first states.
[00:40:17.787 --> 00:40:21.652]  I marched in in 97, protested it with over 100 people, got arrested.
[00:40:22.273 --> 00:40:25.254]  It's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, by the way.
[00:40:25.294 --> 00:40:26.514]  You can watch that clip.
[00:40:26.534 --> 00:40:30.315]  Just type in Alex Jones arrested protesting thumb scanning into Google.
[00:40:30.415 --> 00:40:32.975]  Alex Jones thumb scanning arrest video into Google.
[00:40:33.255 --> 00:40:34.476]  You can go watch it for free, folks.
[00:40:34.516 --> 00:40:38.156]  But the point is that we read the executive order then.
[00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:39.737]  You know what it said?
[00:40:39.757 --> 00:40:41.777]  You know what it said then?
[00:40:42.057 --> 00:40:43.237]  Bill Clinton's executive order?
[00:40:44.018 --> 00:40:49.039]  It said that they're going to take blood and DNA to get a driver's license in the next phase.
[00:40:49.419 --> 00:40:50.679]  And this was for years down the road.
[00:40:52.367 --> 00:41:00.920]  And they said that if you haven't paid all your tickets or have warrants or whatever, or you've got tax problems, they're going to arrest you for taxes there.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.302]  I mean, it's all in there.
[00:41:02.762 --> 00:41:04.365]  It's a hellish system.
[00:41:05.518 --> 00:41:05.918]  We're good to go.
[00:41:30.203 --> 00:41:31.324]  Or South Texas?
[00:41:31.884 --> 00:41:32.965]  Or overseas?
[00:41:33.105 --> 00:41:33.885]  Or Gitmo?
[00:41:34.306 --> 00:41:35.226]  This is official.
[00:41:35.286 --> 00:41:36.127]  You understand.
[00:41:36.907 --> 00:41:37.788]  You understand.
[00:41:37.968 --> 00:41:40.429]  I mean, just, this is the new America.
[00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.652]  I just came out with a new camera that at 500 yards has your face in focus.
[00:41:46.473 --> 00:41:47.553]  Doesn't even have to focus.
[00:41:47.633 --> 00:41:48.594]  Everything is in focus.
[00:41:49.557 --> 00:41:52.799]  Thought I'd cover that as well for their surveillance.
[00:41:52.839 --> 00:42:03.227]  The Homeland Security in one-horse towns where there's, if you're lucky, one little old gas station where they might have cigarettes and three brands of soda pop.
[00:42:03.827 --> 00:42:07.730]  I mean, I've gone to these towns where there's nothing, nothing but one gas pump.
[00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:12.073]  And you go in there and there's cameras all over the town.
[00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:12.874]  Homeland Security.
[00:42:14.415 --> 00:42:15.315]  Got one here today.
[00:42:16.256 --> 00:42:17.517]  Alaska Hamlet...
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.505]  Gets 80 surveillance cameras from DHS, Department of Homeland Security, which now has a faith-based initiative.
[00:42:24.065 --> 00:42:26.027]  And it's cameras through the faith-based initiative.
[00:42:26.047 --> 00:42:27.368]  This is out from about.com.
[00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.732]  And it says it's worthy of a Golden Fleece Award.
[00:42:32.093 --> 00:42:35.616]  Dillingham, Alaska, population 2,400, is installing 80.
[00:42:37.357 --> 00:42:42.662]  I've been in towns where it says the population is 250, and there's at least 10 cameras you can see.
[00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:44.585]  I mean, in neighborhoods.
[00:42:45.246 --> 00:42:56.029]  Billingham, Alaska, population 2,400, is installing 80 surveillance cameras around town, courtesy of a $202,000 Department of Homeland Security grant.
[00:42:56.169 --> 00:43:00.711]  I remember, it says the town is so small it has no streetlights.
[00:43:02.111 --> 00:43:03.392]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:43:04.987 --> 00:43:12.888]  I remember back in 1998 when Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson got us our first $844,000 grant for microphones.
[00:43:12.908 --> 00:43:14.969]  And I remember when I got the microphones in my neighborhood.
[00:43:15.909 --> 00:43:18.790]  It's nice to get the microphone up in your neighborhood with the camera.
[00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:23.070]  You see the camera zooming in and out and it's all AI'd, hooked in with face scanners.
[00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.251]  It's good to live under that.
[00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:26.791]  Borders wide open, government running terror attacks on us.
[00:43:27.191 --> 00:43:27.911]  It's always nice.
[00:43:29.231 --> 00:43:32.292]  And, you know, foreign governments get to buy up the whole country and
[00:43:33.826 --> 00:43:35.448]  Farm corporations are buying us up.
[00:43:37.149 --> 00:43:39.532]  I've got a stack of these, by the way, here.
[00:43:39.812 --> 00:43:42.254]  I know I want to go to your calls, but don't you want to hear all this news, folks?
[00:43:43.015 --> 00:43:43.736]  Here's another one.
[00:43:43.776 --> 00:43:45.217]  This is out of CNET News.
[00:43:46.879 --> 00:43:49.361]  An RFID solution to rush hour headaches.
[00:43:49.441 --> 00:43:56.108]  It's a big, positive article, and it says, IBM's putting these in all over the world, little tracker chips in your inspection stickers.
[00:43:57.068 --> 00:43:57.669]  We're good to go.
[00:44:17.825 --> 00:44:31.898]  And it doesn't matter if it's going to be the equivalent of $3 per gallon on top of the current price, counting the fuel cost and the current tax, $3 extra official instead of taxes when it starts.
[00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:37.363]  It isn't starting like the income tax with a 1% tax on people making a million bucks a year.
[00:44:37.723 --> 00:44:38.884]  Oh, just get them rich guys.
[00:44:38.925 --> 00:44:39.185]  No, no.
[00:44:39.605 --> 00:44:41.427]  It's starting with everybody...
[00:44:42.962 --> 00:44:46.484]  And we're talking $3 a gallon, so I really hope you enjoy that.
[00:44:46.544 --> 00:44:48.065]  And it's official, by the way.
[00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:49.725]  It's officially going in.
[00:44:50.046 --> 00:44:51.846]  People are mad hearing there's going to be toll roads.
[00:44:51.866 --> 00:44:55.308]  They don't even know one one-hundredth of how bad it is.
[00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:58.169]  And, of course, it's foreign owned on top of it.
[00:44:58.189 --> 00:44:58.770]  It's Spanish owned.
[00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:01.751]  But let me just read part of the article, and then we'll go to some calls.
[00:45:01.791 --> 00:45:03.972]  An RFID solution to rush our headaches.
[00:45:03.992 --> 00:45:08.995]  Of course, they don't mention IBM ran the death camp computers, and that's why the Jews and others had little...
[00:45:11.189 --> 00:45:12.189]  Numbers on their arms.
[00:45:12.249 --> 00:45:12.830]  Tattooed on.
[00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:13.590]  You had to enter that.
[00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.690]  Nice folks.
[00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.711]  Pure evil folks.
[00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:19.452]  An IBM traffic system being tested in Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:45:21.153 --> 00:45:24.954]  Reduced rush hour congestion by 25% during its first month of operation.
[00:45:25.454 --> 00:45:27.895]  A big blue wants to bring the technology to the states.
[00:45:28.376 --> 00:45:29.456]  And of course, they already have.
[00:45:30.123 --> 00:45:31.904]  This is a PR piece by Big Blue.
[00:45:32.184 --> 00:45:37.305]  We're already seeing such good results, and I think this will convince other cities to take a look at this.
[00:45:37.566 --> 00:45:42.727]  Now, we caught other cities and other tolling bodies, not private groups, but cities doing this in the past.
[00:45:42.987 --> 00:45:48.389]  They'll openly block two lanes of a four-lane highway, claim they're doing work on it, during the traffic study.
[00:45:48.409 --> 00:45:53.811]  Then they'll take it off when they are doing the second part of the study to see if the RFID works good.
[00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:56.552]  They do a lot of really dastardly stuff.
[00:45:58.609 --> 00:46:00.190]  Of course, I don't think that surprises you.
[00:46:01.391 --> 00:46:10.636]  We're already seeing such good results that I think this will convince other cities to take a look at this, said Peggy Kenley, Vice President of the IBM On Demand Innovative Demon Services.
[00:46:10.716 --> 00:46:11.697]  I mean, Innovative Services.
[00:46:12.057 --> 00:46:17.380]  According to Kenley, the results were made possible by new technology that makes the system highly automatic.
[00:46:18.321 --> 00:46:22.763]  The system revolves around a concept that would be political suicide in many parts of the world.
[00:46:22.803 --> 00:46:25.545]  Under the program, well, not here in Dumbo, America, folks.
[00:46:26.272 --> 00:46:27.354]  We won't even know it.
[00:46:27.374 --> 00:46:29.439]  I mean, China, they tell them you're getting RFID.
[00:46:29.639 --> 00:46:32.705]  Here it just happens in the cards, and people don't know.
[00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:34.349]  By the way, it tracks ships 200 yards.
[00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:36.653]  Thought I'd mention that in the Real ID Act.
[00:46:38.098 --> 00:46:42.659]  The system revolves around a concept that would be political suicide in many parts of the world.
[00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:47.420]  Under the program, Stockholm charges drivers to be on the road.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:56.182]  As payment is made through RFID tax, still large metropolitan areas and other parts of the globe are increasingly looking at ways to clamp down on congestion and pollution.
[00:46:56.502 --> 00:46:58.223]  How does massive taxation do that?
[00:46:58.343 --> 00:46:59.603]  It doesn't, boys and girls.
[00:47:00.783 --> 00:47:04.404]  Either by charging fees or through restrictive regulations, and it goes on and on.
[00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:11.992]  And it says, IBM's leading the way in Massachusetts and in Portugal and in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco and Washington, D.C.
[00:47:12.032 --> 00:47:15.653]  are already discussing suggestion pricing and using their system.
[00:47:16.694 --> 00:47:19.455]  Yeah, we barely beat your bill and you don't care.
[00:47:19.515 --> 00:47:22.075]  It's still going in.
[00:47:22.936 --> 00:47:26.737]  I mean, just enjoy yourselves.
[00:47:26.797 --> 00:47:28.157]  It's going to go in the trucks first.
[00:47:28.737 --> 00:47:30.338]  It's going to go in the taxi cabs first.
[00:47:30.658 --> 00:47:33.799]  But according to the law, they almost passed it being all our inspection stickers right now.
[00:47:34.571 --> 00:47:39.237]  So they're just phasing it in on select groups and being the cops' badges and the cop cars.
[00:47:39.277 --> 00:47:40.179]  Well, I'm getting cracked.
[00:47:40.219 --> 00:47:40.859]  Why aren't you?
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.002]  We're all in this slave pit together.
[00:47:43.022 --> 00:47:47.428]  And so just when you're getting charged that much...
[00:47:49.187 --> 00:47:50.268]  Just remember I told you.
[00:47:50.288 --> 00:48:00.397]  Remember you could have gotten involved and gone to the city council or sued somebody or gone down to the county commissioners or gone and followed board members of these different tolling groups around and caught them.
[00:48:00.417 --> 00:48:03.580]  I don't care if you go catch them cheating on their wife.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.262]  I mean, let's play hardball with these people.
[00:48:05.302 --> 00:48:06.142]  Just burn them.
[00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:07.704]  This is war, folks.
[00:48:07.744 --> 00:48:08.945]  Just burn these people.
[00:48:09.685 --> 00:48:10.166]  Burn them.
[00:48:10.186 --> 00:48:11.547]  Don't do anything illegal.
[00:48:12.628 --> 00:48:15.611]  They're all a bunch of crooks, so they're going to be involved in crooked activity.
[00:48:16.832 --> 00:48:17.753]  Go hire a P.I.
[00:48:17.773 --> 00:48:18.513]  to follow them around.
[00:48:18.673 --> 00:48:19.914]  They'll find all kinds of dirt.
[00:48:19.954 --> 00:48:20.194]  P.I.
[00:48:20.214 --> 00:48:23.296]  will come back 100% of the time and go, you can't believe it, I just caught on tape.
[00:48:23.556 --> 00:48:25.717]  You'll see them getting bags of cash in parking lots.
[00:48:25.737 --> 00:48:27.998]  You'll see them dressed up like transvestites.
[00:48:28.018 --> 00:48:29.799]  You'll see them going to whorehouses.
[00:48:29.819 --> 00:48:31.800]  You'll see them buying crack cocaine.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.742]  Then just start playing hardball with these crooks.
[00:48:35.462 --> 00:48:36.943]  Stop playing games with them.
[00:48:37.643 --> 00:48:38.884]  Scumbag trash!
[00:48:39.704 --> 00:48:42.466]  This makes me so angry.
[00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:49.134]  I'm sorry, just crooks taking over and raping us makes me mad!
[00:48:50.775 --> 00:48:52.997]  By the way, I've got a stack of these high-tech articles here.
[00:48:53.077 --> 00:48:54.899]  I could keep going forever, but I've got to go to your calls.
[00:48:55.259 --> 00:48:56.901]  John and Tejas, you're on the air.
[00:48:59.283 --> 00:48:59.684]  Hello, Alex.
[00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:00.264]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:01.085 --> 00:49:08.732]  It adds to adding a paper today that one of the reasons that Bush had to make this sweetheart nuclear deal with India is because India is a bulwark against China.
[00:49:09.653 --> 00:49:10.554]  I told my wife, I said,
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:18.444]  I'm hoping people are sitting out there reading this saying, if China's a threat to us, why in the heck do we hand the whole economic base to them?
[00:49:18.484 --> 00:49:21.486]  They play this, we've got to transfer everything to India now.
[00:49:21.526 --> 00:49:22.526]  That'll deal with China.
[00:49:22.946 --> 00:49:25.108]  We've got to transfer everything to Japan.
[00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:26.108]  We've got to deal with China.
[00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:27.429]  It's globalist.
[00:49:27.489 --> 00:49:34.373]  It's a handful of corporations setting up an economic system to consolidate all the wealth criminally in their hands.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.160]  The New World Order built China.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.121]  Underneath Mao, they were stuck in a Bronze Age.
[00:49:39.161 --> 00:49:40.201]  They couldn't build nothing.
[00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:46.982]  When Nixon opened it up, man, the technology just flowed in there, and now they're one of the... Another good conservative, and who was the U.S.
[00:49:47.062 --> 00:49:49.503]  ambassador to China that struck the deal?
[00:49:50.943 --> 00:49:52.564]  His son is the president.
[00:49:53.424 --> 00:49:53.604]  Yep.
[00:49:55.144 --> 00:50:04.906]  You know, I think this port deal really hurt him as far as with the American people because it showed the people what a fraud this war on terror is when they found out that Bush was selling the Arabs their ports
[00:50:05.735 --> 00:50:07.458]  I think a lot of people opened their eyes on that.
[00:50:07.478 --> 00:50:09.361]  But you notice the media still says six ports.
[00:50:09.421 --> 00:50:10.663]  It's admittedly 21.
[00:50:12.285 --> 00:50:17.854]  But I heard on the news that a lot of the congressmen were under a lot of heat from their constituents about this.
[00:50:18.294 --> 00:50:19.256]  So I think I really heard them.
[00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:28.272]  I think this deal would give them the nuclear technology to India because they're sitting there saying we've got to go to war with Iran.
[00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:33.575]  India says we're not going to sign any of your treaties and we're going to build more nukes that target your country.
[00:50:33.835 --> 00:50:34.516]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:50:34.556 --> 00:50:35.676]  Here, have some more nukes then.
[00:50:35.696 --> 00:50:39.819]  We've got to go to war with Iran to stop nuclear proliferation.
[00:50:39.859 --> 00:50:40.439]  What a fraud.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:47.804]  When they're giving nothing to anyone, they're in the Stone Age and they're ten years away from an A-bomb if they were left alone and given everything they needed to make it.
[00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:50.553]  But forget the facts, brother.
[00:50:50.633 --> 00:50:51.815]  John, come home.
[00:50:51.835 --> 00:50:56.463]  I mean, they show us space aliens blowing up cities and then say Iran's going to do it.
[00:50:56.523 --> 00:50:59.308]  I mean, it's reached la-la land proportions.
[00:51:02.785 --> 00:51:05.628]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.908 --> 00:51:06.589]  Hello, my friends.
[00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:07.490]  Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:12.494]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.835 --> 00:51:19.581]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:21.882]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.083 --> 00:51:24.925]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.005 --> 00:51:29.688]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.888 --> 00:51:34.271]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.531 --> 00:51:41.756]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:44.418]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:44.598 --> 00:51:46.319]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:52:02.122 --> 00:52:03.743]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.863 --> 00:52:07.966]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:08.106 --> 00:52:10.968]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:11.068 --> 00:52:17.753]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.953 --> 00:52:20.955]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:21.155 --> 00:52:23.556]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.696 --> 00:52:33.842]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.

[00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:19.465]  98%, 97%, 93% of different polls in Texas don't want the toll roads, don't want the transponders.
[00:54:20.646 --> 00:54:26.051]  They just say, doesn't matter what you want, foreign companies, bought off politicians, we're going to do it.
[00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:37.720]  We got a whole bunch of men that wear black uniforms, military trained, they got machine guns, call the police department, and if you don't like it, you come out and complain in protest, they'll come break your skulls in and take you to prison.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:42.104]  And we own those too, we'll make some money off that and have you building widgets in there.
[00:54:42.731 --> 00:54:45.794]  So you keep your mouth shut, scum, and you take it!
[00:54:45.854 --> 00:54:47.275]  You learn how to be a slave!
[00:54:47.475 --> 00:54:49.056]  Now get on there and shut up!
[00:54:50.057 --> 00:54:51.659]  Wait till they get your guns!
[00:54:51.679 --> 00:54:52.439]  You just wait!
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:54.601]  The real final start then!
[00:54:54.761 --> 00:54:55.822]  We're the New World Order!
[00:54:55.962 --> 00:54:58.144]  We've killed hundreds of millions last century!
[00:54:58.384 --> 00:55:00.386]  And that was just a warm-up, you scum!
[00:55:00.406 --> 00:55:02.488]  Now that's their real attitude towards you.
[00:55:03.766 --> 00:55:04.767]  Just know that.
[00:55:05.027 --> 00:55:11.792]  In fact, that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface, the veneer of how evil they are.
[00:55:12.192 --> 00:55:13.873]  That doesn't even pierce into the wickedness.
[00:55:13.913 --> 00:55:14.814]  But that's their attitude.
[00:55:15.174 --> 00:55:16.115]  You're my slave!
[00:55:16.135 --> 00:55:17.116]  We're here to be fed on!
[00:55:17.296 --> 00:55:17.856]  Shut up!
[00:55:18.497 --> 00:55:19.257]  You idiots!
[00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:20.758]  That's their attitude.
[00:55:20.818 --> 00:55:21.579]  Remember that.
[00:55:22.139 --> 00:55:23.820]  Remember that's what the New World Order is doing.
[00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:28.784]  Now, we're carrying the new citizen rule books for a dollar apiece.
[00:55:29.024 --> 00:55:30.845]  And you can get 10 packs, 20 packs, 100 packs of them.
[00:55:32.818 --> 00:55:35.942]  And big discounts, obviously, they're less than a dollar when you buy 20 or 30 or 40.
[00:55:36.042 --> 00:55:40.867]  It just goes down and down and down until we're selling them at basically below cost.
[00:55:41.948 --> 00:55:43.069]  By basically below cost.
[00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.872]  When you buy 10 of them, we're selling them a little bit above cost.
[00:55:45.892 --> 00:55:47.374]  But we've got deals where...
[00:55:48.041 --> 00:55:49.302]  I think we're good to go.
[00:56:13.639 --> 00:56:19.424]  And it's a great gift to give to folks, and there's all the videos, the bookstore, it's all online, all the great books and videos we're carrying.

[00:57:04.015 --> 00:57:04.575]  Remember that.
[00:57:05.036 --> 00:57:08.277]  I'm told... I have to skip ahead to him, because I'm told Larry disagrees with me.
[00:57:08.577 --> 00:57:09.297]  Larry, go ahead.
[00:57:09.317 --> 00:57:10.658]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:57:11.378 --> 00:57:11.558]  Good.
[00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:11.978]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:57:12.338 --> 00:57:12.598]  All right.
[00:57:12.939 --> 00:57:19.981]  Well, just to let you know, I'm not a neocon, but I do disagree with some of the things that you've been saying the last week or so.
[00:57:20.842 --> 00:57:25.623]  As far as the Muslims, it seems like you're giving them a free pass on all of this and making them out to be victims.
[00:57:26.224 --> 00:57:29.965]  And you've also stated that Christians and Jews get along fine in their country.
[00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.176]  And I have to disagree with that.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.824]  I listed specific countries, sir.
[00:57:38.546 --> 00:57:44.436]  And the idea that the Muslims will kill any Jews or any Christians is false.
[00:57:44.556 --> 00:57:45.758]  Are there radical sects?
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:51.721]  Well, I agree with you on that, but, like, for example, you said that in Iraq that Christians and Jews had no persecution there.
[00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:18.732]  But I've spoken to people out of Christians that have left that country and said that they suffered a lot of persecution.
[00:58:18.752 --> 00:58:20.613]  Oh, it's happened certainly recently, sir.
[00:58:20.633 --> 00:58:22.614]  This is ten years ago.
[00:58:22.834 --> 00:58:25.275]  Yeah, ten years ago.
[00:58:25.335 --> 00:58:26.796]  The invasion was 14 years ago.
[00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:28.417]  What about Sudan?
[00:58:30.058 --> 00:58:32.299]  And notice our government isn't doing a thing there, buddy.
[00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:34.720]  You've got real mass murder going on, and there's nothing going to happen!
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.202]  Don't you know our government actually funds the radical Muslim states that kill Christians?
[00:58:41.974 --> 00:58:42.114]  I... I... I...
[00:58:58.186 --> 00:58:58.847]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.507 --> 00:59:00.548]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.269 --> 00:59:02.410]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.031 --> 00:59:03.851]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.612 --> 00:59:05.493]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.153 --> 00:59:09.897]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.357 --> 00:59:14.441]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.045 --> 00:59:33.068]  At the end of the last hour, I was debating with a caller, and I forgot during the one-minute break between hours to ask Scott, is that caller, Larry, still there?
[00:59:33.088 --> 00:59:35.769]  Oh, he hung up.
[00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:37.409]  I was going to hold him over.
[00:59:37.429 --> 00:59:42.110]  He was saying, Alex, you say the Muslims aren't out to kill us, aren't out to get us.
[00:59:42.691 --> 00:59:43.731]  What about Sudan?
[00:59:44.719 --> 00:59:46.300]  And that's a reasonable statement.
[00:59:46.841 --> 00:59:50.284]  I mean, in Africa, you'll have one Christian tribe killing the next Christian tribe.
[00:59:50.304 --> 00:59:52.406]  You'll have the Muslims killing the Muslims.
[00:59:52.426 --> 00:59:53.947]  You'll have the Muslims killing the Christians.
[00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.850]  In Sudan...
[00:59:57.774 --> 01:00:07.464]  The Muslims in the North certainly are coming down for many years now and murdering in mass and enslaving and shipping off the Christians.
[01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:12.328]  And it's despicable, and it's horrible, and it's happening.
[01:00:12.348 --> 01:00:22.298]  And it's part and partial of the politics of Africa where they've been enslaving each other and shipping each other off since the word dot, since the year dot.
[01:00:23.448 --> 01:00:24.568]  And so that's what's happening there.
[01:00:25.049 --> 01:00:34.072]  So you misunderstand me if you think I'm not saying that there aren't Muslims out there, people who use that religion as a pretext to go enslave and kill people and do stuff.
[01:00:34.972 --> 01:00:36.673]  But other religions have done the same thing.
[01:00:37.173 --> 01:00:44.396]  My whole point is Iraq was playing rock and roll music and selling Playboy in their shops and leaving America alone and our supposed ally.
[01:00:44.896 --> 01:00:50.878]  So certainly they weren't Muslim extremists before the invasion and the setup of 1990-1991.
[01:00:53.746 --> 01:00:58.629]  Now, back in the 50s, there were some bombings of synagogues, and that's now been declassified.
[01:00:58.669 --> 01:01:02.472]  It is admitted that Israel, the labor Zionists, carried those bombings out.
[01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:05.814]  By the way, this is in major Israeli newspapers.
[01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:09.337]  To blame it on Muslims to get the Jews to move out.
[01:01:10.808 --> 01:01:13.030]  I mean, this is what our government, the British government, the U.S.
[01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.291]  government, and the Israeli government does.
[01:01:14.311 --> 01:01:15.872]  This is their favorite tactic.
[01:01:15.892 --> 01:01:16.893]  They do it constantly.
[01:01:17.293 --> 01:01:22.217]  And they'll bomb a group of Arabs, a group of Shia, and then blame it on the Sunnis.
[01:01:22.277 --> 01:01:25.400]  Or they'll bomb a group of Arabs and blame it on the local Jews.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:31.785]  I mean, it just never ends to get everyone at each other's throats, and then our governments prance around as the saviors.
[01:01:32.866 --> 01:01:40.312]  And this is what they've been doing forever, and this just continues, and it never seems to stop.
[01:01:41.918 --> 01:01:57.089]  And, yeah, I mean, if our government said, even though it's not our job to do that, hey, we're going into North Korea because they're selling human body parts in open bazaars and have giant slave camps everywhere and the little psychopath runs it, I'd say, well, they got nukes, it's dangerous, why'd you give them nukes?
[01:01:57.149 --> 01:02:01.132]  But, okay, maybe we should have finished it back in the 50s during Korea.
[01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:02.473]  Should have let MacArthur do his job.
[01:02:03.113 --> 01:02:06.436]  If you said, hey, let's go into Sudan and let's go into...
[01:02:08.027 --> 01:02:13.568]  Some of those capital areas, and then let's knock them out or tell them that if they keep doing that, we'll bombard them.
[01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:18.050]  That'd be, well, you know, we're not going to set up oil fields there and not take them over.
[01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:19.590]  Yeah, I think that's just.
[01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.591]  There's such a thing as a just war.
[01:02:21.651 --> 01:02:22.871]  That's not going to happen.
[01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:24.691]  I mean, are you kidding?
[01:02:25.592 --> 01:02:30.813]  Our government backs up about four or five of the stands where Christianity is illegal, and they'll boil you in oil for it.
[01:02:31.604 --> 01:02:33.806]  And they're not even really religious governments.
[01:02:35.327 --> 01:02:38.389]  They're more communistic than that, and they just don't tolerate anything.
[01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:41.191]  So I don't even know what to say to this anymore.
[01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:49.837]  You know, this whole religious belief and this whole fake hoax subculture that's got the Muslims creeping around everywhere wanting to kill us.
[01:02:49.897 --> 01:02:52.359]  In most Muslim countries, I have Dar Jamal on.
[01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:53.780]  He's a Lebanese Christian.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.943]  He's an American, multi-generational Texan, but he's a Lebanese Christian.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.142]  And I know a lot of Lebanese who are Christians.
[01:03:01.562 --> 01:03:03.484]  I know a lot of Egyptians that are Christians.
[01:03:04.444 --> 01:03:10.629]  I had a friend growing up who was Egyptian, who was an Egyptian Christian.
[01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:17.474]  And I've had Shiite Muslim friends who are from Iraq who I went to high school and college with.
[01:03:17.514 --> 01:03:18.355]  Really nice people.
[01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:19.436]  People I lived at weights with.
[01:03:20.276 --> 01:03:21.677]  And they weren't foaming at the mouth.
[01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:22.838]  They had Christian friends.
[01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:25.881]  Go over to their house for dinner and they'd have Christians over.
[01:03:26.321 --> 01:03:27.422]  It is not true.
[01:03:28.937 --> 01:03:29.337]  Okay?
[01:03:30.358 --> 01:03:34.721]  I mean, have there been Christian countries who use it as a political excuse to go kill their neighbors?
[01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:35.102]  Yes.
[01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:37.303]  Is it the minority of Christians?
[01:03:37.383 --> 01:03:37.744]  Yes.
[01:03:39.765 --> 01:03:41.827]  Look, Iran has Christians and Jews in it.
[01:03:42.867 --> 01:03:43.268]  Okay?
[01:03:43.308 --> 01:03:43.928]  A bunch of them.
[01:03:45.409 --> 01:03:49.572]  I think Iran, 6% of the population is Jewish and around 7% is Christian.
[01:03:50.773 --> 01:03:51.414]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:51.434 --> 01:03:51.854]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.803 --> 01:03:58.129]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.309 --> 01:04:02.675]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:08.695]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:04:10.437 --> 01:04:14.662]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.722 --> 01:04:21.670]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:23.793]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:24.053 --> 01:04:34.496]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.776 --> 01:04:40.157]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:04:53.487 --> 01:04:56.949]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:57.229 --> 01:05:00.731]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:04.754]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.974 --> 01:05:11.157]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.557 --> 01:05:19.462]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:25.226]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.366 --> 01:05:29.149]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:31.351]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.431 --> 01:05:33.593]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:33.853 --> 01:05:38.776]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:51.605]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:05:52.485 --> 01:05:54.186]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:05:54.586 --> 01:05:57.567]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:03.169]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:06:03.489 --> 01:06:13.013]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:06:13.293 --> 01:06:15.494]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[01:06:15.774 --> 01:06:19.337]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:06:19.597 --> 01:06:22.819]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:26.642]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:06:26.802 --> 01:06:30.245]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:06:30.405 --> 01:06:31.666]  I'm really amazed.
[01:06:31.826 --> 01:06:37.650]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:40.212]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:06:40.572 --> 01:06:48.696]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:06:48.876 --> 01:06:50.857]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:06:55.079 --> 01:07:01.121]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.722 --> 01:07:04.703]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:18.087 --> 01:07:36.872]  They came and took it all away The lanes and the meadows The places where you used to play It was an inside job By the well-connected Your little protest
[01:07:44.784 --> 01:07:55.389]  We're good to go.
[01:08:18.237 --> 01:08:39.606]  This little island disappears While you are looking the other way They'll take your rights to own your own ideas And isn't it sad to be the same again?
[01:08:41.894 --> 01:08:45.336]  We're good to go.
[01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:16.472]  We're good to go.
[01:09:16.492 --> 01:09:16.632]  I think?
[01:09:47.655 --> 01:10:16.614]  I know what I've done wrong I am acquainted with the night I know how hard it is To always walk out in the night And it's an inside job To learn about forgiving It's an inside job To hang on to the joy of living You know the road by which you came I know your mother made the name
[01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:20.903]  We're good to go.
[01:10:42.861 --> 01:10:49.413]  Around the middle of the next hour we've got two prominent individuals coming on who are getting states like Connecticut and others to move forward.
[01:10:50.295 --> 01:10:50.736]  Vermont.
[01:10:51.828 --> 01:10:55.591]  With moves to impeach George W. Bush.
[01:10:55.832 --> 01:11:13.426]  And I had Ron Paul on last Thursday, Congressman, and he said that clearly the things Bush has been doing is finally woking conservatives up and that Bush is probably going to lose the Congress to the Democrats and that the Democrats then will probably move to impeach Bush.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:14.860]  We're good to go.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.040]  I think?
[01:11:38.578 --> 01:11:39.299]  I think we're good to go.
[01:11:39.339 --> 01:11:40.460]  I think we're good to go.
[01:11:57.958 --> 01:11:59.019]  I think we're good to go.
[01:12:25.493 --> 01:12:26.736]  That's all fine and dandy.
[01:12:26.756 --> 01:12:29.161]  But anything really serious, you're not going to see it.
[01:12:29.201 --> 01:12:32.809]  And South by Southwest is owned by a Jabba the Hutt-like creature.
[01:12:33.704 --> 01:12:35.025]  It's great to be in your studio.
[01:12:35.045 --> 01:12:36.785]  You've got a cool place developing here.
[01:12:36.805 --> 01:12:38.326]  And also, we have some history.
[01:12:38.346 --> 01:12:39.166]  You just reminded me that...
[01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:05.820]  Over a decade now, we've been working together, so it's good to be here.
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:06.421]  You bet.
[01:13:06.441 --> 01:13:08.143]  And of course, some people accuse me of being evil.
[01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:10.545]  I mean, how dare I be anti-drugging of the children?
[01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:11.987]  This is radical.
[01:13:12.307 --> 01:13:14.950]  You know, they admit... I heard you tell a story yesterday.
[01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:19.936]  You had the woman on with you on Jack Blood's show who had... I want to personalize it up front.
[01:13:20.716 --> 01:13:21.077]  I think so.
[01:13:41.411 --> 01:13:42.452]  Totally screws her up.
[01:13:42.552 --> 01:13:54.056]  And then the day her mother's coming to take her and make her go, and she had a big future ahead of her, to get back on the psychotropics, she committed suicide in the most horrible fashion.
[01:13:54.776 --> 01:13:59.638]  And they admit that it has a massive increase in psychotic breaks and committing suicide.
[01:13:59.918 --> 01:14:01.539]  Tell that story for us first.
[01:14:01.619 --> 01:14:03.300]  I want to personalize it first.
[01:14:05.621 --> 01:14:06.381]  Gwen Olson...
[01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:07.907]  Well, her niece...
[01:14:30.097 --> 01:14:30.678]  Killed herself.
[01:14:30.718 --> 01:14:32.079]  You gave the lead in already.
[01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:35.863]  Basically what happened is she first tried to hang herself with her shoelaces.
[01:14:36.744 --> 01:14:38.585]  The light fixture from the ceiling broke.
[01:14:38.866 --> 01:14:39.446]  That didn't work.
[01:14:39.486 --> 01:14:46.393]  She then doused herself with some sort of lamp oil, flammable liquid, and set herself to fire and died just a horrific death.
[01:14:46.833 --> 01:15:02.648]  So we see a lot of times these horrific kind of suicides with torturing themselves, hanging themselves, repeatedly stabbing themselves, these things that normally just... Girls especially have never been known to be able to take butcher knives and half sever their own heads.
[01:15:03.009 --> 01:15:07.273]  Girls have never been known in history in any culture to be able to brutally kill themselves.
[01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:09.895]  I mean, very rarely really tough men would do this.
[01:15:10.095 --> 01:15:11.597]  This is psychotic viciousness.
[01:15:12.117 --> 01:15:17.719]  Andrea Yates, the woman in Houston who drowned all her children, is coming up for trial again.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:28.744]  But the truth behind that story is that she was on at least two of these so-called antidepressant drugs and was just intensely psychotic as an effect of those drugs and drowned five of her children.
[01:15:28.784 --> 01:15:36.347]  Again, just a completely abnormal... I mean, breaking a lamp and dumping it on yourself and then sitting there and not rolling, because you'll instinctively roll.
[01:15:36.827 --> 01:15:38.728]  Not rolling, just letting it burn, burn me.
[01:15:38.788 --> 01:15:40.269]  I mean, that's just, that's hell on earth.
[01:15:40.908 --> 01:15:57.510]  Well, it's hell on earth, just like drowning your children is hell on earth, just like a teenager, Clint McIntosh, a friend of mine, also in this movie that's showing tomorrow, his daughter hung herself with her shoelaces at Cedar Park Middle School here in town under the effects of Paxil and Apexor.
[01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:00.232]  These horrific stories we see over and over again.
[01:16:00.472 --> 01:16:05.835]  And you're right that they're admitting it, but only because of under duress.
[01:16:05.955 --> 01:16:14.681]  Only because the public outcry and the parents and the family members coming forward has forced them to at least acknowledge that suicide is a direct effect of these type of drugs.
[01:16:15.061 --> 01:16:15.442]  Now, Ms.
[01:16:15.522 --> 01:16:18.104]  Olson had already quit her job at Big Pharma.
[01:16:18.484 --> 01:16:24.629]  She'd already had adverse effects herself pushing psychotropic, so it's not like she just got mad after her niece died.
[01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:29.554]  I mean, she'd already gotten out of the system, and then it still affected her with her niece dying.
[01:16:29.614 --> 01:16:30.915]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:16:31.713 --> 01:16:34.434]  Well, her story is unbelievable.
[01:16:34.494 --> 01:16:35.334]  It's very tragic.
[01:16:35.374 --> 01:16:54.222]  Her book is great because she has those levels of working in the industry and knowing, having become disillusioned as an insider in the industry and then getting caught up herself because she was at the effect of those belief systems and when she felt blue, she tried the drugs and then started going bonkers and recognized it and then seeing her sister's child.
[01:16:54.602 --> 01:16:55.182]  Well, it's simple.
[01:16:55.222 --> 01:16:58.023]  I mean, that's what a hardcore street drug pusher does.
[01:16:58.303 --> 01:17:09.025]  They get you on one thing and then try to walk you up, knowing, okay, you've been in a car wreck, you're now depressed because you've been addicted to Vicodin for a few months.
[01:17:09.605 --> 01:17:18.386]  Hey, listen, go take a week off, go to the mountains, go roll around in the clover, jump in cold streams, have no stress, deal with it, do whatever you have to.
[01:17:18.786 --> 01:17:21.547]  You're going to feel good once those receptors open back up.
[01:17:21.607 --> 01:17:23.207]  I mean, everybody knows that's what opiates do.
[01:17:24.108 --> 01:17:27.251]  And I mean, I had a big leg break and had surgery once.
[01:17:27.271 --> 01:17:30.814]  It was all that stuff for a week after the surgery, and I was depressed when I went off of it.
[01:17:31.034 --> 01:17:32.695]  I didn't go gobble Prozac.
[01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:33.616]  I mean, they know it.
[01:17:33.836 --> 01:17:36.058]  So they knowingly put her on this other thing.
[01:17:36.779 --> 01:17:38.040]  Well, yeah, it's a pattern.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:43.865]  I came into your studio just at the very last second because I just left a mother in tears in my office saying,
[01:17:44.497 --> 01:17:51.759]  Because she had a son, high schooler, who was experimenting with various illegal drugs.
[01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:55.020]  She decided she needed to intervene because he was going downhill.
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:55.600]  What happened?
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.621]  Got in the mental health system.
[01:17:56.641 --> 01:17:58.081]  He then got on all these psych drugs.
[01:17:58.361 --> 01:18:05.563]  Now, five years later, he's diagnosed chronic schizophrenic, and she's coming to me to try to create a structure to help him reclaim his life.
[01:18:05.803 --> 01:18:11.165]  It's a common pattern to see young people having a hard time getting caught up in psychiatry, and it's made even worse.
[01:18:12.065 --> 01:18:13.967]  Well, I mean, I remember I had a lot of hard times growing up.
[01:18:14.007 --> 01:18:15.969]  My parents knew that it was just part of growing up.
[01:18:16.009 --> 01:18:17.450]  I mean, life is about struggles.
[01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:18.792]  Life is about getting depressed.
[01:18:18.832 --> 01:18:23.136]  Life is about... I mean, what did we do a thousand years ago without Prozac bushes?
[01:18:23.789 --> 01:18:24.989]  Life is about struggle.
[01:18:25.049 --> 01:18:31.711]  Life is that you become melancholy and sad at times, especially if you confront the kind of things that Alex Jones talks about on his show.
[01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:32.611]  That's right.
[01:18:32.951 --> 01:18:37.692]  And to pathologize those things in order to sell a product is the bottom line.
[01:18:37.752 --> 01:18:42.333]  In order for the pharmaceutical industry to profit is really tragic and pathetic.
[01:18:42.373 --> 01:18:52.215]  By the way, on the store right next to his little grocery store, they've got a big drug ad with a sad snowman saying, you know, come take psychotropics.
[01:18:55.994 --> 01:18:57.660]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:00.009]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:09.062]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.302 --> 01:19:11.924]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:11.904 --> 01:19:13.325]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.485 --> 01:19:20.431]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:20.671 --> 01:19:23.654]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:24.014 --> 01:19:24.514]  We're good to go.
[01:19:24.574 --> 01:19:24.894]  I think?
[01:19:55.342 --> 01:19:56.383]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:56.803 --> 01:20:02.286]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:02.846 --> 01:20:03.346]  That's right.
[01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:05.948]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.508 --> 01:20:13.432]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:13.982 --> 01:20:21.686]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.126 --> 01:20:26.988]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.608 --> 01:20:30.650]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.311 --> 01:20:33.671]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.789 --> 01:20:55.390]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:59.654]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:59.774 --> 01:21:02.656]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:21:02.736 --> 01:21:09.422]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:21:09.622 --> 01:21:12.624]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:21:12.844 --> 01:21:15.226]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:15.366 --> 01:21:25.512]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:21:25.592 --> 01:21:26.212]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:26.332 --> 01:21:28.193]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:53.430 --> 01:22:01.962]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:22:02.182 --> 01:22:03.984]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:22:04.205 --> 01:22:05.406]  That's one in four adults.
[01:22:05.727 --> 01:22:08.711]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it
[01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:09.512]  We're good to go.
[01:22:27.512 --> 01:22:27.732]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:22:59.147 --> 01:23:04.670]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:06.611]  Dr. John Breeding is our guest.
[01:23:07.591 --> 01:23:11.173]  We talked about some of the folks locally that this is happening to.
[01:23:11.909 --> 01:23:14.611]  They know what serotonin reuptake inhibitors do.
[01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:18.314]  They know what these amphetamine stimulant drugs do.
[01:23:18.614 --> 01:23:22.738]  Let's go over the numbers of how many adults, how many children are on these.
[01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:26.921]  And then I want to talk about New Freedom Initiative because they passed this last year.
[01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:29.263]  Now they're having to implement at the state level.
[01:23:29.283 --> 01:23:32.305]  It's just like Bush is trying to implement a national ID card.
[01:23:33.106 --> 01:23:39.171]  But now the state of New Hampshire is in the middle of trying to pass an act right now
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:45.982]  House Bill 1582, very close to passing, that will ban the implementation of it.
[01:23:46.002 --> 01:23:47.863]  Well, we can do the same thing with New Freedom.
[01:23:47.903 --> 01:23:50.144]  We are doing that, and this is going to be adults, too.
[01:23:50.464 --> 01:23:51.985]  Dr. Breeding, run us through some of the numbers.
[01:23:54.226 --> 01:24:01.488]  In 1970, there was about 200,000 children in the United States on the psychiatric drugs, mostly the stimulant drugs.
[01:24:01.929 --> 01:24:03.149]  That was enough to cause the U.S.
[01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:05.170]  Congress to call an investigative hearing.
[01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:12.570]  To put the Ritalin type of drugs as controlled substances so the Drug Enforcement Administration would look over it.
[01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:19.277]  In spite of all that, because of their high addictive potential and risk of abuse, so these were known dangers for way back when.
[01:24:20.157 --> 01:24:29.286]  In spite of that, today we have probably 10, 11 million school-aged children in the United States on psychiatric drugs, about two-thirds of those the speed type drugs.
[01:24:30.017 --> 01:24:40.005]  A bunch of those, the SSRIs that we've been talking about, a bunch of those now, more and more, the so-called neuroleptics, the Thorazine-type drugs, which cause permanent neurological damage.
[01:24:40.326 --> 01:24:44.189]  So tens of millions, I mean millions of millions, 10, 11 million kids.
[01:24:44.649 --> 01:24:55.018]  In terms of adults, what we know, and it's clear the way to think about it, is that a society does not choose to drug millions of their children unless millions of the adults
[01:24:56.439 --> 01:25:07.332]  I mean, I know people all around me are on it, and the ads are everywhere.
[01:25:07.412 --> 01:25:14.360]  I mean, as I said before the break, just about 15 feet from us, or I guess actually about 10 yards away from us, about 30 feet away.
[01:25:16.718 --> 01:25:17.579]  We're good to go.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:18.240]  I think?
[01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:40.862]  Doctor, as you know better than I, they knew that it actually made things worse.
[01:25:41.222 --> 01:25:49.004]  And then after you're screwed up on these drugs, they'll get you on four or five of those, some foster kids, 18 drugs, who were totally healthy before.
[01:25:49.044 --> 01:25:55.326]  Then they get you on to the zombie drugs, as you said, the stuff that just knocks you completely out.
[01:25:56.127 --> 01:25:56.928]  That's the pattern.
[01:25:56.968 --> 01:25:59.570]  You start on one, it causes derangement.
[01:25:59.970 --> 01:26:04.094]  They add another, interpret that as a different mental illness, such as bipolar.
[01:26:04.734 --> 01:26:07.577]  Then they add psychotic features and add the other class of drugs.
[01:26:07.597 --> 01:26:08.377]  That's how it works.
[01:26:09.058 --> 01:26:10.639]  And it's ubiquitous.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.361]  The ads are everywhere.
[01:26:12.381 --> 01:26:14.062]  It's direct-to-consumer advertising.
[01:26:14.122 --> 01:26:17.485]  It's in the magazines and newspapers, the televisions, the radios.
[01:26:18.999 --> 01:26:23.401]  Josh Billings, American humorist, said a funny thing one time.
[01:26:23.441 --> 01:26:27.503]  He said, the problem is not that people don't know anything, it's that they know so many things that ain't so.
[01:26:28.263 --> 01:26:32.205]  In the realm of psychiatry, it means everybody knows depression is a chemical imbalance.
[01:26:32.545 --> 01:26:34.686]  Everybody knows schizophrenia is genetic.
[01:26:35.146 --> 01:26:46.751]  See, these things are assumed to be facts by the general public, and the truth is, they're just belief systems and propaganda that have been put out there, and they're justified to sell these drugs and put people on the drugs.
[01:26:46.831 --> 01:26:48.592]  It's millions and millions and millions of people.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:50.821]  Well, it is.
[01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:56.926]  And so we got 15 plus percent, a little over 15 percent of the kids on it, over 15 percent of the adults on it.
[01:26:57.266 --> 01:27:03.912]  And I remember in Ohio, one of the administrators who saw the new Freedom document a year before it passed, now two years ago, released it.
[01:27:03.972 --> 01:27:06.914]  And it says, hey, we got 15 percent on it now.
[01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:10.137]  We're going to get half the people on the drugs.
[01:27:10.217 --> 01:27:11.758]  And then from there, the sky's the limit.
[01:27:11.798 --> 01:27:15.602]  I mean, they're going to have a society where it's policed by the judges and the cops.
[01:27:16.142 --> 01:27:18.304]  Very soon, where half of us are forced on these.
[01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:25.266]  The history of it is rooted in Texas, just like a lot of current American history.
[01:27:26.827 --> 01:27:37.777]  The Texas medication algorithm project, called TMAP, in the mid-1990s, a select committee in conjunction with our local mental health system, largely funded by certain pharmaceutical companies,
[01:27:38.334 --> 01:27:38.494]  And it's
[01:27:58.575 --> 01:28:02.477]  The screening is forced to then, quote, according to these cooked numbers, fine people.
[01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:04.438]  Oh, you're a 12-year-old who gets depressed.
[01:28:04.458 --> 01:28:04.758]  That's it.
[01:28:04.798 --> 01:28:05.298]  You're on drugs.
[01:28:05.518 --> 01:28:08.340]  What 12-year-old is going to say they don't get depressed sometimes?
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:13.022]  The screening is recommended by the President's New Freedom Commission.
[01:28:13.042 --> 01:28:15.403]  That's a great Orwellian term, New Freedom.
[01:28:16.244 --> 01:28:22.527]  And the people that were put on that committee are the same people that were involved in the original TMAP formulation.
[01:28:22.587 --> 01:28:23.207]  So you got it.
[01:28:23.647 --> 01:28:27.269]  It's a mass marketing schema for big pharma companies.
[01:28:27.751 --> 01:28:32.234]  Pushed and funded and driven by the U.S.
[01:28:32.254 --> 01:28:32.494]  government.
[01:28:33.115 --> 01:28:37.998]  And your wife doesn't know that hours after she has that baby, the social worker walks in, are you depressed?
[01:28:38.939 --> 01:28:40.400]  And you go, yeah, I've gotten depressed.
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.002]  They're going to jerk your child and hop you up.
[01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:44.963]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.423 --> 01:28:47.004]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.024 --> 01:28:50.647]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:53.849 --> 01:29:54.469]  We're good to go.
[01:30:14.755 --> 01:30:15.716]  We're good to go.
[01:30:15.776 --> 01:30:16.656]  We're good to go.
[01:30:16.676 --> 01:30:17.237]  We're good to go.
[01:30:42.192 --> 01:30:56.943]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[01:30:57.404 --> 01:31:01.547]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[01:31:02.087 --> 01:31:09.473]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[01:31:09.878 --> 01:31:13.862]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[01:31:14.262 --> 01:31:27.714]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[01:31:28.135 --> 01:31:31.518]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of stem enhancers.
[01:31:31.889 --> 01:31:36.150]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:39.411]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[01:31:39.571 --> 01:31:41.832]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[01:31:42.132 --> 01:31:43.152]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[01:31:43.172 --> 01:31:46.253]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.135 --> 01:32:07.335]  I want to make something clear.
[01:32:07.435 --> 01:32:09.476]  I believe we need counselors.
[01:32:09.856 --> 01:32:19.117]  I don't even think that having somebody who, quote, is a psychiatrist or a psychologist is a bad thing to talk about the workings of the brain and talk about why we have feelings and what goes on.
[01:32:19.157 --> 01:32:34.620]  But they don't want to give you ideas and time-proven things that our cultures have learned and common sense that a pastor or really anybody else can give you because it doesn't fit into the monopoly of this special group of scribes or Pharisees
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:44.882]  And it goes back to the old priesthoods, the old witch doctors, manipulating populations, taking populations over, drugging populations.
[01:32:44.962 --> 01:32:46.763]  I've researched a lot of the corrupt shaman.
[01:32:47.583 --> 01:32:51.364]  I'm not saying all shaman 5,000 years ago, 6,000, 7,000 were bad.
[01:32:51.584 --> 01:33:02.026]  I'm saying many times in many cultures they would take over, become corrupt, and then begin forcing the population to take all these weird drugs to manipulate them, saying it was magic.
[01:33:03.847 --> 01:33:05.609]  Reading the portends and the stars.
[01:33:06.069 --> 01:33:10.813]  Basically like carnival hucksters taking over entire civilizations.
[01:33:10.873 --> 01:33:13.455]  Babylon, the Aztecs with the Mayan cultures.
[01:33:14.326 --> 01:33:14.867]  We're good to go.
[01:33:33.630 --> 01:33:35.471]  This is where psychopathic Dr. Mingala-type people...
[01:34:02.666 --> 01:34:04.128]  Could just enjoy themselves.
[01:34:04.168 --> 01:34:15.841]  And now they've teamed up with Big Pharma, and they're just going absolutely wild in this country, trying to force half the population onto it, already over 15% of the population on it.
[01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:17.445]  We're good to go.
[01:34:39.767 --> 01:34:43.790]  Passing the current through the cerebral cortex and the frontal lobes.
[01:34:44.251 --> 01:34:50.257]  But what about the things that are going on with just the founders of psychiatry?
[01:34:50.277 --> 01:34:52.739]  I mean, it was psychiatrists who loved Hitler.
[01:34:52.779 --> 01:34:53.740]  They were big supporters.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.527]  He used a lot of what they had to say and do with that social Darwinism and this Malthusian view.
[01:35:00.567 --> 01:35:03.910]  I mean, I want to go back to the roots of this, if we may.
[01:35:04.525 --> 01:35:04.865]  You bet.
[01:35:05.285 --> 01:35:07.306]  Well, the history of psychiatry is infamous.
[01:35:07.346 --> 01:35:14.569]  You know, one story is that Benjamin Rush is the man who emblazons the seal of the American Psychiatric Association today.
[01:35:15.129 --> 01:35:20.131]  He was the personal physician for the founding father of our country, George Washington.
[01:35:21.312 --> 01:35:24.653]  His treatment of George Washington actually killed him.
[01:35:24.753 --> 01:35:28.114]  It was a bloodletting kind of treatment that they believed in in those days.
[01:35:28.134 --> 01:35:29.475]  Bloodletting for two and a half days.
[01:35:30.151 --> 01:35:37.153]  So, Benjamin Rush, the founding father of psychiatry in America, killed the founding father of the United States of America.
[01:35:37.213 --> 01:35:38.134]  That's quite a story.
[01:35:38.734 --> 01:35:47.357]  Rush is famous for his statement that pain and terror and shame are the main tools and methods for treating and controlling the mentally ill.
[01:35:48.988 --> 01:35:56.954]  One of my great teachers, Thomas Zotz, I love his metaphor, his analogy that the inquisition is to heresy as psychiatry is to mental illness.
[01:35:57.394 --> 01:36:00.897]  Basically, you nailed it in terms of it's about social control.
[01:36:01.377 --> 01:36:03.579]  Pharmakia is a social control dynamic.
[01:36:03.619 --> 01:36:04.199]  You said it.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.921]  There's a real truth behind it.
[01:36:06.361 --> 01:36:12.926]  And the reason why Aldous Huxley's book, Brave New World, is so appealing and the whole story of Soma and all that, drugs...
[01:36:13.526 --> 01:36:15.308]  Are used to control populations.
[01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:19.313]  But psychiatry, per se, is a mechanism of social control.
[01:36:19.573 --> 01:36:20.875]  Mental illness is made up.
[01:36:21.055 --> 01:36:21.916]  It's a metaphor.
[01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:26.001]  It doesn't really exist in the sense of a biologically or genetically based disease.
[01:36:26.021 --> 01:36:31.006]  Somebody may have syphilis, and they can show scrofulous on the shoulder.
[01:36:31.047 --> 01:36:34.010]  They can show lesions in the brain, and that's causing...
[01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:39.393]  A rabid dog bites you, you get rabies, you go crazy because of the fever, you're dying.
[01:36:39.714 --> 01:36:40.694]  That's medical.
[01:36:41.315 --> 01:36:47.158]  But you're saying they just randomly, with no proof of anything, just say, oh, you've got this, you've got that.
[01:36:47.198 --> 01:36:53.242]  And every year they come up with new, hundreds of new things on the charts where, oh, you think the government's involved in 9-11.
[01:36:53.462 --> 01:36:54.863]  That's a special mental illness.
[01:36:55.223 --> 01:36:57.425]  I mean, it's like the Soviet Union.
[01:36:58.084 --> 01:37:05.665]  And when the criminal justice... Well, this is almost a joke nowadays, but when the criminal justice system is not...
[01:37:06.627 --> 01:37:18.331]  Sufficient to enforce a social dynamic, you can bring in psychiatry and accuse a mental illness, you know, which is really just a metaphor for behavior that's troubling or troubled.
[01:37:18.951 --> 01:37:27.353]  And that justifies an intervention, a violation of your civil rights, and a so-called involuntary commitment, which really means psychiatric incarceration.
[01:37:27.654 --> 01:37:32.195]  There's about 1.5 million Americans today that are incarcerated
[01:37:32.916 --> 01:37:37.839]  Violated their civil liberties, taken their liberty away just on the justification that they have of mental illness.
[01:37:37.859 --> 01:37:38.600]  This is huge.
[01:37:40.341 --> 01:37:42.442]  It's ultra-massive, and it's expanding.
[01:37:42.983 --> 01:37:43.723]  I want to make that clear.
[01:37:43.763 --> 01:37:44.824]  They're not backing off.
[01:37:44.844 --> 01:37:45.765]  They're not going away.
[01:37:45.825 --> 01:37:47.906]  They are growing like a metastasizing cancer.
[01:37:48.502 --> 01:38:00.011]  So the history of psychiatry includes tranquilizing chairs, fever packs, cold packs, dunkings, all kinds of things basically to shock and startle and subdue and suppress people.
[01:38:00.472 --> 01:38:06.957]  And at some point, and then they went into insulin coma shocks and electroshocks, which are still used unbelievably.
[01:38:07.457 --> 01:38:15.263]  But in the 50s, basically, these heavy-duty tranquilizers came in and they became able to be used to control and manage populations.
[01:38:15.283 --> 01:38:17.425]  And the tens of thousands of deformities in children.
[01:38:18.015 --> 01:38:19.015]  We're good to go.
[01:38:40.004 --> 01:38:41.745]  And you've got millions of our kids on it.
[01:38:42.205 --> 01:38:47.587]  The history is infamous, the current practice is infamous, and it's continuing right up until... And what about lobotomy?
[01:38:47.647 --> 01:38:51.509]  I mean, they did that to tens of thousands, and they would literally just jam an ice pick in.
[01:38:51.529 --> 01:38:59.692]  Tell us, I've seen the photos of lobotomies being done where he's laughing, and you start jamming just an ice pick in, giggling it around in brain.
[01:39:01.053 --> 01:39:05.374]  Lobotomy was developed about the same time that the electroshock technologies were developed.
[01:39:05.555 --> 01:39:07.695]  It was literally jamming an ice pick.
[01:39:07.715 --> 01:39:10.036]  The guy Walter Freedom had a lobotomobile.
[01:39:10.076 --> 01:39:10.956]  He traveled around.
[01:39:10.996 --> 01:39:13.057]  He was quite a Barnum and Bailey kind of showman.
[01:39:13.097 --> 01:39:16.378]  He personally lobotomized thousands and thousands of people.
[01:39:17.659 --> 01:39:19.919]  Eventually the public outcry stopped that.
[01:39:19.999 --> 01:39:26.681]  Plus they had these other technologies that were a little less... Why are there so many psychopaths that want to go around killing and maiming people?
[01:39:27.202 --> 01:39:28.182]  Why do they get off on it?
[01:39:29.011 --> 01:39:35.655]  There's a certain percentage of the population, estimated at maybe 2%, that has a pattern that is basically suppressive.
[01:39:35.735 --> 01:39:43.060]  It's a pattern that somehow says, the way I survived is by suppressing, crushing other people.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.741]  And that's the dynamic that they do.
[01:39:44.781 --> 01:39:49.804]  They tend to often end up in psychiatry, often in government, often in other power positions.
[01:39:51.593 --> 01:39:52.734]  I interpret it that way.
[01:39:53.314 --> 01:39:55.316]  It's always been the case, it seems like.
[01:39:55.376 --> 01:40:07.126]  And they say, with their social Darwinism, just like the theory of Darwin, which is two separate things, where survival of the fittest, the biggest, baddest, smartest cat is going to be able to breed, then it will pass on its genetics.
[01:40:07.706 --> 01:40:09.166]  And develop from there.
[01:40:09.186 --> 01:40:10.407]  They say because they're ruthless.
[01:40:10.427 --> 01:40:13.708]  They say because they'll kill innocent Iraqi children and laugh about it.
[01:40:13.968 --> 01:40:15.148]  Because they're willing to do it.
[01:40:15.508 --> 01:40:18.309]  They say they're strong and have a right to rule while we're weak.
[01:40:18.529 --> 01:40:19.369]  I say the opposite.
[01:40:19.670 --> 01:40:27.752]  Just because a cancer grows faster in your human flesh, say in your lung, and eventually kills you, didn't make that cancer better or more elite.
[01:40:27.832 --> 01:40:29.272]  It just killed a living being.
[01:40:29.612 --> 01:40:30.433]  It was aberrant.
[01:40:30.493 --> 01:40:31.493]  It was malfunctioning.
[01:40:32.501 --> 01:40:36.762]  It's aberrant, and the good news is that those people are ultimately self-destructive.
[01:40:37.143 --> 01:40:37.843]  That's the good news.
[01:40:38.083 --> 01:40:43.625]  The bad news is that a lot of people in a lot of places get really hurt badly in the meantime.
[01:40:44.685 --> 01:40:50.227]  Another current infamy, besides all these drugging kids and all this horror stuff in the name of pseudoscience,
[01:40:50.822 --> 01:40:51.082]  Thank you.
[01:41:05.996 --> 01:41:07.436]  That's the opposite of the Hippocratic Oath.
[01:41:07.676 --> 01:41:12.517]  That's the opposite of the Hippocratic Oath, and it's another place of shame and disgrace for the psychological and medical professionals.
[01:41:12.537 --> 01:41:13.458]  And they also have medical doctors.
[01:41:13.478 --> 01:41:14.658]  They have medical doctors helping.
[01:41:14.698 --> 01:41:17.018]  In fact, I wanted to ask you about this a few weeks ago.
[01:41:17.338 --> 01:41:19.259]  John Yoo, he admitted it on tape.
[01:41:19.979 --> 01:41:23.500]  He was the deputy of Alberto Gonzalez, now the Attorney General, White House Counsel.
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.320]  And he went further than Gonzalez, saying Bush can torture.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.540]  Bush is above the law.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.161]  If we don't call it torture, it isn't torture.
[01:41:29.181 --> 01:41:30.801]  He said, no, we can torture.
[01:41:31.647 --> 01:41:35.428]  And we can torture small children crushing their genitalia in front of their parents.
[01:41:35.948 --> 01:41:37.689]  And we know they do rape kids in front of their parents.
[01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:38.589]  That's mainstream news.
[01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:40.170]  Neocons defend it.
[01:41:40.610 --> 01:41:48.393]  How did we go from the point of Joseph Mingle is bad because he tortures children in Nazi Germany to, oh yes, we're the good guys.
[01:41:48.513 --> 01:41:50.473]  We rape small children in front of their parents.
[01:41:51.434 --> 01:41:53.114]  We crush their genitalia.
[01:41:53.734 --> 01:41:59.196]  And then at the same time, though, if someone does that in the private, they get the death penalty and they should.
[01:41:59.436 --> 01:42:01.197]  But when the government does it, it's good.
[01:42:02.188 --> 01:42:09.355]  Well, you know, there is one strand, you know, in which one guy I know wrote a book called Psychiatrists, the Men Behind Hitler.
[01:42:09.835 --> 01:42:15.881]  But, you know, there's an aspect of which Hitler's program was justified as the eugenics kind of thing, life unworthy of living.
[01:42:16.141 --> 01:42:23.528]  We're going to improve the species of the race by speeding up the Darwinist thing, you know, by basically eliminating the bad genes.
[01:42:24.008 --> 01:42:25.089]  We're good to go.
[01:42:37.467 --> 01:42:38.107]  They all came here.
[01:42:38.127 --> 01:42:40.990]  Do you know about 27% of major research laboratories in this country are named after Nazis?
[01:42:56.907 --> 01:43:02.130]  Named after Germans who were involved in that and continued the tradition here.
[01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:07.673]  And so it basically translated over in current biopsychiatric practice.
[01:43:07.753 --> 01:43:09.214]  This got picked up in the AP.
[01:43:09.394 --> 01:43:11.255]  You were there and you said, did you hear that to the AP?
[01:43:11.295 --> 01:43:12.596]  And the AP picked it up.
[01:43:12.876 --> 01:43:20.340]  They said, you got up and you said, you're going to put the majority, over two-thirds of Texas foster kids are on these drugs, more than what, four on average?
[01:43:20.781 --> 01:43:22.241]  And he said, yeah, they're subhuman.
[01:43:22.282 --> 01:43:24.763]  In fact, I mean, the quote, tell us about it.
[01:43:25.203 --> 01:43:39.077]  Joe Burkett, big MHMR guy up in Fort Worth, a doctor there, a psychiatrist, basically said that when the legislator asked him, well, why are so many foster kids on so many drugs?
[01:43:39.817 --> 01:43:42.180]  He said, because they're severely mentally ill.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:44.242]  They come from a bad gene pool.
[01:43:45.194 --> 01:44:05.815]  So it was just an overt statement of the fact that when you put your child on a drug because they supposedly have ADHD, which is supposedly a neurological defect, or when you take Zoloft because you have a chemical imbalance, which is supposedly a biological defect, that is basically the same eugenic kind of philosophy that problems in living, that failures in social adjustment,
[01:44:06.235 --> 01:44:19.724]  ...are not due to personal problems, social problems, whatever, but they're due to a biological or genetic defect, which needs to be, if not eradicated with electroshock or lobotomy, at least put under severe control.
[01:44:19.744 --> 01:44:22.426]  What has changed, though, that... I mean, they're doing it on purpose.
[01:44:22.446 --> 01:44:25.588]  They're not... Everything they do is calculated for psychological effect.
[01:44:25.608 --> 01:44:26.549]  That's who they consult.
[01:44:26.569 --> 01:44:30.631]  They've got top PR and top psychologists and psychiatrists admittedly on the payroll.
[01:44:31.051 --> 01:44:32.192]  You know, very intelligent people.
[01:44:32.212 --> 01:44:32.272]  And...
[01:44:35.007 --> 01:44:44.777]  They are openly coming out and saying, and then simultaneously TV dramas are grammatizing it, saying it's good, that torturing small children is now good.
[01:44:45.058 --> 01:44:48.541]  I mean, that's like the ultimate evil, and now we're being told it's good.
[01:44:48.561 --> 01:44:51.004]  This is part of a larger conditioning, Dr. Brady.
[01:44:51.044 --> 01:44:52.906]  Why do you think the establishment is doing that?
[01:44:55.177 --> 01:44:58.301]  Well, there's certain things that you do to justify war.
[01:44:58.881 --> 01:45:09.374]  One is you make people really afraid, and two, you create a really evil enemy out there that is going to put you in severe danger and jeopardy, and it happens over and over again.
[01:45:11.505 --> 01:45:12.366]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:14.448]  See, we agree with this.
[01:45:14.468 --> 01:45:18.811]  I think the main reason is they know they can legitimize the most horrible thing imaginable.
[01:45:19.232 --> 01:45:27.679]  If they can run that far, light years into the pit of hell, than what we ever thought we'd be at, and legitimize it, then think of all the evil that's behind it.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:31.803]  Think about all the things that are, quote, lesser that they can then legitimize.
[01:45:31.863 --> 01:45:33.904]  It's kind of like, give me a million miles.
[01:45:35.025 --> 01:45:37.107]  I'll try to take a million miles, and then you'll just give me 500,000.
[01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:39.570]  Well, I think that's true.
[01:45:39.611 --> 01:45:42.455]  I think the other part of it is that it's a very slippery slope.
[01:45:42.515 --> 01:45:53.231]  Once you start with saying, okay, we're going to reserve torture for some very high al-Qaeda operatives or whatever, but once people start participating in that, it just unlocks this dark...
[01:45:53.866 --> 01:45:55.448]  There's hundreds of black sites.
[01:45:55.488 --> 01:45:56.309]  They call them black world sites.
[01:46:16.548 --> 01:46:19.529]  And then the neocons go, look, they want to stay at Abu Ghraib.
[01:46:19.629 --> 01:46:21.430]  Oh, they're begging to stay at Camp X-Ray.
[01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:27.393]  Because it's then admitted later if you read the actual documents, because they tell them, your brother went to the black site.
[01:46:27.433 --> 01:46:28.133]  He's dead.
[01:46:28.533 --> 01:46:29.514]  They actually killed him there.
[01:46:29.894 --> 01:46:31.715]  We're not going to take you to Eastern Europe.
[01:46:31.795 --> 01:46:36.137]  And they take them in with these former guards, Russian guards, torture them to death.
[01:46:36.477 --> 01:46:39.458]  This is all... But the neocons spend... Oh, look, they want to stay.
[01:46:39.478 --> 01:46:39.958]  They like it.
[01:46:39.978 --> 01:46:42.099]  No, they tell them, you think this torture's bad.
[01:46:42.399 --> 01:46:49.602]  Being chained up all night by your ankles or being made to sit on your knees or not being fed or being force-fed, which is a really way to torture you with a tube.
[01:46:49.622 --> 01:46:51.443]  They torture the Falun Gong like that in China.
[01:46:52.103 --> 01:46:54.044]  And they go, no, please, don't send me there.
[01:46:54.064 --> 01:46:56.885]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:46:57.432 --> 01:47:14.186]  It's unbelievable, you know, and what I'm hearing more and more is that, you know, basically psychology came forward and psychiatry and helped to develop in the 50s and 60s in conjunction with the CIA, the modern interrogation methods, which are much less physical and much more psychological.
[01:47:14.226 --> 01:47:20.732]  And basically it involves some sort of sensory deprivation, isolation, or stimulation together with self-inflicted pain.
[01:47:20.972 --> 01:47:22.533]  So you put people in stress positions.
[01:47:22.833 --> 01:47:24.535]  And these two combinations of things
[01:47:25.656 --> 01:47:26.898]  Well, we know.
[01:47:26.958 --> 01:47:32.446]  They've got drugs combined with hallucinogens that, quote, guarantee to give you a bad trip.
[01:47:32.466 --> 01:47:36.211]  They give you a drug to make you nauseated and have a migraine with LSD.
[01:47:36.251 --> 01:47:38.634]  They inject you after five days and no sleep being beat up.
[01:47:38.935 --> 01:47:41.859]  Then they sit there and put you on a table and slide you down into water.
[01:47:42.219 --> 01:47:46.383]  Then they dance around in devil outfits, and the people are vomiting, totally having psychotic breaks.
[01:47:46.423 --> 01:47:53.830]  Then they tell them, you're a terrorist, you're going to go carry out a terror attack, and it'll be real easy, we'll take care of you if that happens, or the demons are going to come back.
[01:47:54.170 --> 01:47:59.375]  So see, after hundreds of bad trips, it goes back to Ewing Cameron and the brainwashing he did for the CIA in Canada.
[01:47:59.875 --> 01:48:01.196]  This is how mind control is done.
[01:48:01.216 --> 01:48:06.381]  I mean, imagine, you're on LSD with a migraine headache drug while people dance around in devil outfits.
[01:48:06.821 --> 01:48:09.923]  And then all of a sudden it goes away and they give you a drug that wipes it, makes you come out of it.
[01:48:09.963 --> 01:48:11.503]  Now see, here's the code word.
[01:48:11.523 --> 01:48:13.304]  It all goes away when you do what you're told.
[01:48:13.324 --> 01:48:15.345]  So they're actually making terrorists at these bases.
[01:48:15.365 --> 01:48:17.146]  I wanted to add that for you, sir.
[01:48:17.346 --> 01:48:27.991]  All that goes on, you know, but what they found is that the most powerful technologies really are the sensory deprivation, isolation stimulation, and the self-inflicted stress positions, and they really work.
[01:48:28.391 --> 01:48:28.911]  We're good to go.
[01:48:46.764 --> 01:48:53.597]  The incredible strength of character that takes decades to develop to not be susceptible to getting caught up in that kind of dynamic.
[01:48:53.617 --> 01:48:58.486]  So you take a good young man, and we hear this from parents more and more about their soldiers coming back, and they say,
[01:48:59.853 --> 01:49:00.634]  The U.S.
[01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:09.441]  Army, a good boy, and you brought me back a monster, meaning someone who has been really deranged and disturbed and caught up in these evil acts.
[01:49:09.501 --> 01:49:12.023]  Well, they've never seen statistics of this type of murder.
[01:49:12.043 --> 01:49:21.250]  I mean, where units come back and kill all their wives, where they come back and burn their children up, or where they kill their commanding officers, or where they kill cops, or where they rob banks.
[01:49:21.710 --> 01:49:25.113]  Because once you've gotten somebody to kill little kids and laugh about it, they're not going to stop.
[01:49:25.593 --> 01:49:37.419]  And the danger is that these young people then come back and they're interpreted as mentally ill and those young people, they're going to then be put on the same psychiatric drugs and attributed as weak.
[01:49:37.579 --> 01:49:40.801]  Yeah, they're now saying 25% of the trips are mentally ill and need drugs.
[01:49:41.181 --> 01:49:48.265]  Yeah, they're severely disturbed for good reasons, but they are not mentally ill and don't need drugs, that's for sure.
[01:49:48.305 --> 01:49:50.286]  We'll continue this discussion and take your calls.
[01:49:50.306 --> 01:49:50.866]  Stay with us.
[01:49:55.006 --> 01:49:57.848]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:59.690]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.030 --> 01:50:04.714]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.

[01:50:22.108 --> 01:50:26.511]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.751 --> 01:50:33.976]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:26.175 --> 01:52:26.575]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.428 --> 01:53:03.370]  I know we've got a load of phones, Sharon, specifically for our guests, Chris, Evan, Tom, Sammy, many others.
[01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:05.231]  We're going to get to you.
[01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:06.751]  Dr. Breeding, it really boils down to this.
[01:53:06.811 --> 01:53:16.614]  You've got different types of people in this world, and you've got a lot of sociopathic, predatory types who get off and enjoy dominating populations, and they think it's a strength to be ruthless.
[01:53:16.654 --> 01:53:18.414]  They see us as hamburger meat at the store.
[01:53:19.074 --> 01:53:21.795]  They see us just as worthless.
[01:53:22.395 --> 01:53:24.416]  They see us as human resources, as they call us.
[01:53:25.046 --> 01:53:33.389]  And until the rest of us figure that out and stop letting their programming and their propaganda naively manipulate us, it's only going to get worse.
[01:53:33.449 --> 01:53:40.091]  I mean, at every level, the types of corruption we're seeing dwarf anything that's come in the past, which scares me.
[01:53:40.111 --> 01:53:50.554]  And if you look at tyranny and craziness by elites in the past, it always grows slowly and then accelerates, and then there's more activity in just a few months, a few years, than there was in 100 years before.
[01:53:52.417 --> 01:53:58.018]  I forget who said that in history there's more activity in a couple of days than there is in generations.
[01:53:58.859 --> 01:54:00.419]  But that's now happening.
[01:54:00.459 --> 01:54:03.900]  By the way, we carry both of Dr. Breeding's best books.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.341]  So you need to get them.
[01:54:07.361 --> 01:54:08.481]  We have a package up there.
[01:54:08.501 --> 01:54:16.863]  We also have Dr. Eisenstein's book that goes with it in a package deal about educate before you vaccinate, about the nightmares that are happening there.
[01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.003]  Before we go to these calls...
[01:54:18.829 --> 01:54:19.670]  I wanted to bring this up.
[01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:30.996]  Porting down, putting RAF soldiers and others in gas chambers and murdering them, knowing they were going to murder them, releasing nerve gas, VX, sarin, killing them, dissecting their bodies.
[01:54:31.556 --> 01:54:38.060]  They know they did this to at least 45 at this one facility, and of course thousands went through it and have really bad health effects.
[01:54:39.101 --> 01:54:41.282]  But in Project Shad, thousands of U.S.
[01:54:41.302 --> 01:54:42.743]  troops were killed knowingly.
[01:54:43.584 --> 01:54:52.314]  How do you get a government that will just knowingly, the ringworm children in Israel, they tell them they're going to get a ringworm checkup for fungus, they'd radiate them and kill them, U.S.
[01:54:52.354 --> 01:54:53.015]  government paid for that.
[01:54:53.295 --> 01:54:54.717]  That's mainstream Israeli papers.
[01:54:55.476 --> 01:54:55.716]  How?
[01:54:55.876 --> 01:54:57.657]  I mean, that goes to the heart.
[01:54:57.697 --> 01:55:04.499]  The same crew with the forced drugging has done thousands of admitted tests in America to our troops and our citizens.
[01:55:04.639 --> 01:55:10.561]  And again, I go back to, these people really are sick, evil, dark people.
[01:55:10.581 --> 01:55:13.322]  They're almost like antimatter compared to normal people.
[01:55:13.362 --> 01:55:16.023]  They're almost like the shadow world of that.
[01:55:16.043 --> 01:55:16.703]  Can you speak to that?
[01:55:17.597 --> 01:55:32.043]  Well, they're clearly severely disconnected from their heart and from their children and from all of life, you know, and so how that disconnect happens for different people, I don't know, but it's just a severely painful thing to think about.
[01:55:32.083 --> 01:55:34.304]  Are a lot of them victims of abuse themselves?
[01:55:34.864 --> 01:55:43.928]  Well, I think everyone is a victim of abuse in the sense of having been disconnected, you know, from the ability to really feel empathy, you know.
[01:55:44.208 --> 01:55:46.609]  The other thing that happens, though, is that certain structures...
[01:55:47.819 --> 01:55:50.460]  It had more of an effect in the individual personality.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:56:00.685]  You know, it's like with the Abu Ghraib thing, you know, when you see those pictures and the guy who ran the prison experiment at Stanford, Philip Zimbardo, you know, where they put...
[01:56:01.266 --> 01:56:04.129]  Wasn't the finding that 90% would deliver a shot that they believed was legal?
[01:56:24.648 --> 01:56:25.109]  We're good to go.
[01:56:25.169 --> 01:56:25.789]  We're good to go.
[01:56:40.638 --> 01:56:44.864]  You know, have not had the life to develop the character that can we resist.
[01:56:45.004 --> 01:56:47.287]  So these wars are really universities of evil.
[01:56:47.848 --> 01:56:49.850]  That's why they want to get our young people into the prison system.
[01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:51.472]  That's a university of crime.
[01:56:52.233 --> 01:56:58.622]  And then the globalists get to have the counterbalance of the state against this when really the state laid these eggs.
[01:56:59.202 --> 01:57:08.326]  And people get into authority positions in the government, and they've already gone through a process, apparently, of being willing to do whatever it takes to be in power and stay in power.
[01:57:08.346 --> 01:57:13.228]  Well, I read about how royals and the Rockefellers and others are mean to their children to, quote, make them tough.
[01:57:13.748 --> 01:57:14.828]  But, like, really mean to them.
[01:57:15.208 --> 01:57:17.689]  Sitting in the boarding school saying, beat him up daily, you know.
[01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:23.872]  Dead Poets Society was a great movie about that, you know, about how the elite is indoctrinated by...
[01:57:24.562 --> 01:57:26.123]  Shaming and pain induction.
[01:57:26.143 --> 01:57:26.924]  You know, it's true.
[01:57:26.964 --> 01:57:30.966]  You know, you've got to learn that these authorities... We'll be right back.
[01:57:30.986 --> 01:57:32.827]  We've got a break.
[01:57:33.888 --> 01:57:37.791]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.111 --> 01:57:38.871]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.981 --> 01:57:50.621]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.282 --> 01:57:52.342]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.063 --> 01:57:54.143]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.824 --> 01:57:55.624]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.384 --> 01:57:57.345]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.945 --> 01:58:01.667]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.127 --> 01:58:04.489]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[01:58:05.362 --> 01:58:06.222]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.443 --> 01:58:08.884]  A lot of big developments on the Iran front.
[01:58:08.924 --> 01:58:12.345]  We'll cover those coming up later in the shower.
[01:58:12.405 --> 01:58:15.687]  There's moves at the state level to impeach Lord Bush.
[01:58:15.727 --> 01:58:17.548]  Got some guests in 15 minutes joining us on that.
[01:58:17.968 --> 01:58:21.789]  No caller's been holding for a while, so let's go ahead and go to Sharon in Florida.
[01:58:21.829 --> 01:58:24.391]  Sharon, you're on the air with Dr. John Breeding and Alex Jones.
[01:58:24.651 --> 01:58:24.971]  Welcome.
[01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:26.331]  Hey, good afternoon.
[01:58:26.452 --> 01:58:29.593]  I have a friend who has a son that's 12 years old.
[01:58:29.753 --> 01:58:34.175]  At nine, he was put on Zoloft and one other medication, which I didn't catch.
[01:58:34.827 --> 01:58:40.611]  He is now being diagnosed at the age of 12 with bipolar, and they're going to have to change medicine, increase medicine.
[01:58:41.051 --> 01:58:51.739]  They're looking at alternative ways, and they don't have any idea what... But listen, the drug companies, their own documents admit, they know that the first drug is going to screw them up, and they're going to get you on more and more.
[01:58:51.759 --> 01:58:56.803]  I mean, it's like a drug dealer giving your child a hit of ecstasy, and a month later he's got them on heroin.
[01:58:56.823 --> 01:58:57.263]  Dr. Brady?
[01:58:59.102 --> 01:58:59.943]  That's the pattern.
[01:59:00.203 --> 01:59:04.426]  You start on the stimulant drugs or the SSRIs like Zoloft.
[01:59:04.486 --> 01:59:06.187]  It's almost like they're drug pushers.
[01:59:06.227 --> 01:59:07.528]  Oh, they are drug company pushers.
[01:59:07.568 --> 01:59:07.988]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:08.008 --> 01:59:08.629]  Go ahead.
[01:59:08.769 --> 01:59:18.196]  And then you see these extreme fluctuations of consciousness, you know, where you get really high and excitable and irritable and agitated or, on the other hand, depressed.
[01:59:18.236 --> 01:59:19.717]  That's interpreted as bipolar.
[01:59:20.137 --> 01:59:25.540]  You add another mood stabilizer, then you add an antipsychotic, pretty soon you've got a drug cocktail of three or four.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:38.126]  Your friends need to just know this is a severe danger condition, to look at creating a safe space to gradually wean the child off the drugs, and to do whatever it takes to create a safe, supportive community for that young person to come back.
[01:59:38.206 --> 01:59:39.406]  Or their child's dead.
[01:59:39.426 --> 01:59:46.910]  They're going to be basically psychologically ruined, the brain totally worm-eaten, and it'll just be some invalid you take care of the rest of your life if you're lucky.
[01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:51.491]  Or on the downside, we're talking about suicide here or incarceration.
[01:59:51.711 --> 01:59:53.431]  The incarceration numbers go way up, too.
[01:59:54.291 --> 01:59:55.812]  So, it's a danger condition.
[01:59:55.852 --> 01:59:59.372]  You know, my website, wildestcolts.com, has information.
[01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:08.434]  There's people around who can help you, but you're going to have to reach out and find some alternative sources besides the people who are already leading you down that road.
[02:00:08.454 --> 02:00:13.595]  Well, listen, when these people have a captive population, take a WOAI TV special about a year ago on this.
[02:00:13.675 --> 02:00:15.536]  We have the transcript on the website and video clips.
[02:00:15.976 --> 02:00:16.516]  They admit it.
[02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:18.392]  And this is even Clear Channel TV.
[02:00:19.712 --> 02:00:23.935]  They talked to the state, and it was doctors, medical doctors, going, look, this little young 10-year-old was happy.
[02:00:23.995 --> 02:00:25.155]  I sent him to the psychologist.
[02:00:25.436 --> 02:00:26.296]  He got on one drug.
[02:00:26.336 --> 02:00:26.896]  Now he was on 18.
[02:00:27.016 --> 02:00:27.937]  Then he died.
[02:00:28.766 --> 02:00:30.586]  And then you start having seizures from the drugs.
[02:00:30.806 --> 02:00:40.609]  They will kill you with the drugs knowingly because that's what the drug companies wrote the handbooks to maximize it.
[02:00:41.249 --> 02:00:44.449]  And the average foster child in Texas is on four drugs.
[02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:47.010]  Over two-thirds are on them.
[02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.790]  Dr. Brady?
[02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:55.852]  The movie that we're screening tomorrow night at the Unity Church of the Hills here in Austin, Prescription Suicide, and you can go to that website to look at it,
[02:00:56.523 --> 02:01:04.428]  Is about several parents whose children have died as a result of the effect of drugs like Zoloft.
[02:01:04.468 --> 02:01:06.449]  Just locally here in Austin, it's an epidemic.
[02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:09.811]  Two of the families profiled in the film are here in Austin.
[02:01:10.825 --> 02:01:16.048]  Now, if you go to that website, does it have links to where that church is located?
[02:01:16.088 --> 02:01:18.450]  Go ahead and go to GwenOlson.com.
[02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:19.811]  Her website will have that.
[02:01:20.071 --> 02:01:24.233]  We're going to have them here in studio tomorrow, but we need to get links to that up today.
[02:01:24.834 --> 02:01:26.875]  But it's the Unity Church in North Austin?
[02:01:27.215 --> 02:01:29.757]  Unity Church of the Hills in Northwest Austin.
[02:01:30.819 --> 02:01:32.081]  Well, that's a nice area over there.
[02:01:32.101 --> 02:01:33.623]  Do you know what they're charging, or is it free?
[02:01:34.144 --> 02:01:38.209]  I believe it's a church deal, so they have what they call, I believe it's a love offering.
[02:01:38.249 --> 02:01:40.712]  It's free, and you can make a small donation if you want.
[02:01:40.792 --> 02:01:47.742]  Just replying in the director, who's a five-time Emmy Award winner, is what I read, and he'll be in studio tomorrow with us.
[02:01:47.782 --> 02:01:48.443]  Anything else, ma'am?
[02:01:48.743 --> 02:01:52.345]  Yeah, was that PrescriptionSuicide.com that you said to go to?
[02:01:52.526 --> 02:01:55.267]  Well, go to GwenOlson.com for sure.
[02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:57.689]  I think the film is called Prescription Suicide.
[02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:59.750]  If you put that in, you'll find it, I'm sure.
[02:01:59.770 --> 02:02:01.872]  G-W-E-N-O-L-S-E-N?
[02:02:02.032 --> 02:02:04.494]  G-W-E-N-O-L-S-E-N, Gwen Olson.
[02:02:04.974 --> 02:02:07.796]  But with search engines, you don't have to spell it right.
[02:02:07.916 --> 02:02:08.756]  Okay, great.
[02:02:08.816 --> 02:02:09.777]  Thank you very, very much.
[02:02:09.837 --> 02:02:10.558]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:02:11.138 --> 02:02:13.820]  So now the child is on these drugs and getting worse.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:15.161]  That's the pattern.
[02:02:15.201 --> 02:02:16.982]  Yes, he's now bipolar.
[02:02:17.887 --> 02:02:19.028]  There is no bipolar.
[02:02:19.088 --> 02:02:22.030]  It's a made-up label that's put on children.
[02:02:22.050 --> 02:02:22.590]  Well, you know what?
[02:02:22.650 --> 02:02:25.232]  When I was doing bad things in my life, I was unhappy.
[02:02:25.252 --> 02:02:29.255]  When I'm doing good things and giving and helping people, I'm on a constant high.
[02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:32.076]  I can work 17 hours a day, feeling great.
[02:02:32.116 --> 02:02:32.877]  I just love life.
[02:02:33.397 --> 02:02:36.479]  Is something wrong with me that I don't take any drugs and I'm just happy all the time?
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:40.142]  You're in an extreme state of mind.
[02:02:40.182 --> 02:02:42.963]  I think there's something severely wrong with you, Alex Jones.
[02:02:43.264 --> 02:02:44.004]  I need drugs.
[02:02:44.104 --> 02:02:44.384]  All right.
[02:02:45.555 --> 02:02:52.401]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.702 --> 02:02:54.083]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.283 --> 02:02:56.485]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.645 --> 02:02:58.727]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.987 --> 02:03:03.952]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.272 --> 02:03:08.316]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.536 --> 02:03:10.337]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.397 --> 02:03:21.045]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.205 --> 02:03:23.086]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.306 --> 02:03:27.169]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:03:27.269 --> 02:03:28.690]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[02:03:46.579 --> 02:03:47.620]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:50.721]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.001 --> 02:03:55.143]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.583 --> 02:03:56.403]  So what do you do?
[02:03:56.724 --> 02:04:01.285]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:01.786 --> 02:04:03.926]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.407 --> 02:04:05.247]  Sheltering in place.
[02:04:05.683 --> 02:04:19.096]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.136 --> 02:04:26.262]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:04:45.077 --> 02:04:51.944]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:04:52.104 --> 02:05:04.996]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:05:05.196 --> 02:05:05.716]  We're good to go.
[02:05:22.145 --> 02:05:26.148]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:05:26.388 --> 02:05:28.249]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:06:04.784 --> 02:06:24.081]  Dr. Breeding, the elite that's running things, they've got all the fancy PR and the propagandists and the psychiatrists working for them, but we were talking during the break about how they leave breadcrumbs, how psychopaths always get more and more arrogant, more and more crazy in the things they're doing, almost like they're trying to get caught.
[02:06:24.721 --> 02:06:25.702]  What is that phenomenon?
[02:06:27.526 --> 02:06:37.830]  We believe that human nature at its deepest is inherently good in the sense that we're connected, we're tending towards empathy and caring for each other.
[02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:48.114]  If that is human nature, then these deranged patterns violate that, and there's a tendency for people who are criminals to sabotage themselves, basically.
[02:06:48.454 --> 02:06:53.216]  So what we see with the Bush administration, for example, is they just leave evidence everywhere.
[02:06:54.498 --> 02:06:56.080]  That allows them to get caught.
[02:06:56.441 --> 02:06:57.743]  And you do it over and over again.
[02:06:57.763 --> 02:06:58.824]  They're not hard to catch.
[02:06:59.085 --> 02:07:07.056]  With the torture stuff, with the wiretapping stuff, with the flu stuff, whatever you look at, they leave evidence to get caught.
[02:07:07.416 --> 02:07:09.780]  It's our job to catch them and to hold them accountable.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:14.542]  The problem is that when you catch them the first time, and this is important to know like with people in your life, you catch them the first time and you don't
[02:07:30.246 --> 02:07:31.887]  We're good to go.
[02:07:32.027 --> 02:07:32.727]  We're good to go.
[02:07:53.763 --> 02:08:00.646]  To step up and to hold each other accountable and just bring us back to our true nature, which is that we really want to love and support each other.
[02:08:00.686 --> 02:08:01.486]  It's pretty simple.
[02:08:03.147 --> 02:08:03.947]  Okay.
[02:08:04.067 --> 02:08:04.948]  Come up in a few minutes.
[02:08:04.968 --> 02:08:05.968]  We've got some guests joining us.
[02:08:05.988 --> 02:08:08.749]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to some callers.
[02:08:09.009 --> 02:08:10.470]  Who's up next in order here?
[02:08:12.511 --> 02:08:14.031]  Chris in Texas, a real trooper.
[02:08:14.051 --> 02:08:14.672]  You're on the air.
[02:08:14.752 --> 02:08:15.192]  Go ahead.
[02:08:15.212 --> 02:08:16.852]  Hey, Alex.
[02:08:16.872 --> 02:08:17.393]  How are you doing?
[02:08:17.853 --> 02:08:18.193]  Good, sir.
[02:08:18.772 --> 02:08:21.693]  I was going to bring up a point you talked about at the very beginning of the program.
[02:08:21.754 --> 02:08:22.574]  Apparently, J.D.
[02:08:22.654 --> 02:08:28.497]  Hayworth talked to the National Guard in Arizona and the new plan by Governor Napolitano.
[02:08:29.551 --> 02:08:32.072]  Is more of a PR event?
[02:08:32.273 --> 02:08:33.853]  There's really no substance to it?
[02:08:33.873 --> 02:08:35.214]  They're going to be doing support roles?
[02:08:35.234 --> 02:08:37.295]  Yeah, I said I'd mention that, and I meant to.
[02:08:37.535 --> 02:08:42.758]  For those that don't know, the governor down there, because of incredible pressure, claims he's going to put troops on the border.
[02:08:42.778 --> 02:08:46.700]  But in reality, it's the same thing Texas did, and Rick Perry and Bush went down to the border.
[02:08:47.461 --> 02:08:53.184]  One hundred police and military rotated in over the next six months...
[02:08:54.413 --> 02:08:55.574]  100 police and military.
[02:08:55.594 --> 02:08:57.896]  They're going to send out 10 military.
[02:08:57.996 --> 02:08:58.836]  Oh, 10 cops.
[02:08:59.337 --> 02:09:00.077]  Together to work.
[02:09:00.117 --> 02:09:01.838]  And then next month to 20 more.
[02:09:02.419 --> 02:09:05.421]  It is totally and completely staged.
[02:09:05.521 --> 02:09:06.141]  It is a joke.
[02:09:06.181 --> 02:09:08.223]  And I said, yeah, give us the details.
[02:09:08.523 --> 02:09:10.684]  Because I knew that it was, quote, unnamed.
[02:09:10.704 --> 02:09:15.447]  And then I did find that she was talking about a couple hundred National Guard, in, quote, support roles doing nothing.
[02:09:15.647 --> 02:09:16.188]  So go ahead.
[02:09:17.136 --> 02:09:24.519]  Yeah, what it was, they're going to be changing oil and doing preventive maintenance on vehicles that possibly would be used by the Border Patrol.
[02:09:25.019 --> 02:09:30.040]  They will apparently be doing some trunk searches in arrears areas, not actually on the border.
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:35.562]  Yeah, so in the middle of the state, pulling citizens over and searching cars, using it as a police state excuse.
[02:09:36.023 --> 02:09:43.105]  And then apparently they're sending some National Guard computer technicians to aid in any rear area support computer difficulties.
[02:09:43.789 --> 02:09:46.030]  So, and this is what J.D.
[02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:49.232]  Hayworth, King Neocon, Lord of New World Order, had to say.
[02:09:49.272 --> 02:09:50.993]  Was he saying it was wonderful or saying it was bad?
[02:09:51.514 --> 02:10:06.203]  No, no, he was saying that it's not enough, that the state, that the governor has the power to do more, and in a sense, he was backdoor criticizing her for, you know, this, in a sense, which is like a PR event that's not really... Well, that's what other governors are doing.
[02:10:06.223 --> 02:10:07.383]  I mean, that's what Rick Perry's doing.
[02:10:07.403 --> 02:10:11.766]  We're demanding something because, quote, we're under terrorist attack any minute, but our borders are wide open.
[02:10:12.742 --> 02:10:12.942]  Right.
[02:10:13.002 --> 02:10:14.803]  Now, I tell you what, I want to bring up one other thing.
[02:10:15.283 --> 02:10:20.565]  I have a relative of mine that's currently in Iran and has been there off and on over the last few years.
[02:10:21.485 --> 02:10:25.746]  That person is, was born in Iran, and I have a lot of relatives that are Persian.
[02:10:26.647 --> 02:10:31.828]  I was born myself in Minnesota, so part of my family is Persian, the other part is Danish.
[02:10:32.409 --> 02:10:42.152]  But one thing about Iran, I've always thought that Iraq was all about, and Afghanistan was actually always about Iran, to put bookends around Iran.
[02:10:43.939 --> 02:10:48.462]  For whatever the reasons are, but it's kind of interesting within Iran.
[02:10:50.004 --> 02:11:10.420]  Iran right now has pretty much one of the highest, or Tehran itself is probably the junkie capital of the world, and a lot of reports my relatives tell me that have been to Iran and are over there right now, is that prostitution and drug usage within Iran, which has a very young demographic as a country right now, is rampant.
[02:11:10.841 --> 02:11:12.422]  So it's kind of another example.
[02:11:13.058 --> 02:11:20.023]  Of another government, you know, that's allowing the populace to be distracted, well, they do whoever knows what.
[02:11:20.863 --> 02:11:26.567]  Well, certainly, there's a lot of corruption by the Iranian leadership, and the globalists have always wanted to go into Iran.
[02:11:26.587 --> 02:11:29.969]  They've done it several other times, and it's very serious.
[02:11:29.989 --> 02:11:31.390]  They want that entire region.
[02:11:32.139 --> 02:11:40.443]  The Pentagon says there's 60-plus countries they want to invade, and they admit their own war planners say it's not about terrorists, it's about corporate interests.
[02:11:41.363 --> 02:11:42.744]  They're big policy reports.
[02:11:42.784 --> 02:11:46.185]  They're big C-SPAN talks they give.
[02:11:46.225 --> 02:11:48.106]  They say, we work for Wall Street.
[02:11:48.887 --> 02:11:50.267]  So I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:11:50.767 --> 02:12:00.852]  And speaking of what's happening with the Iran situation, Dr. Brady's going to write Shotgun with us some more and talk about the whole Bush situation, local psychologist here in town, good friend of mine.
[02:12:01.798 --> 02:12:06.185]  We are joined by Dan DeWalt and David Swanson.
[02:12:12.671 --> 02:12:22.813]  One of their folks on with us, and Vermont selectman Dan DeWalt, to discuss recent developments in campaigns to impeach Bush and remove his cronies from office.
[02:12:22.833 --> 02:12:24.074]  And don't think this can't happen.
[02:12:24.434 --> 02:12:35.956]  And I know Bush is just a puppet of these global interests, but still, we need to impeach him, to punish him, to let everybody know, and other presidents know, he is not the law, he is not dictator, regardless of what his White House says or what he says.
[02:12:36.016 --> 02:12:39.457]  And for those that don't know, he's really declaring that he is a dictator.
[02:12:40.863 --> 02:12:45.064]  David Swanson with UpperDowningStreet.org and of course Dan DeWalt.
[02:12:45.144 --> 02:12:46.945]  Thank you both for joining us.
[02:12:46.965 --> 02:12:47.745]  Dan DeWalt again.
[02:12:49.565 --> 02:12:51.146]  Thank you so much for joining us both.
[02:12:51.386 --> 02:12:53.226]  Where are you both respectively right now?
[02:12:54.087 --> 02:12:54.547]  I'm calling.
[02:12:54.787 --> 02:12:55.947]  I'm in Newfane, Vermont.
[02:12:56.927 --> 02:12:58.648]  And I am in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[02:12:59.301 --> 02:13:04.884]  Okay, and the latter is David Swanson of atrodowningstreet.org?
[02:13:05.245 --> 02:13:05.985]  Correct, yes.
[02:13:06.325 --> 02:13:07.086]  Thanks for having me.
[02:13:07.706 --> 02:13:08.206]  You bet.
[02:13:08.407 --> 02:13:10.508]  Let's talk to Dan DeWalt first.
[02:13:10.588 --> 02:13:13.009]  Dan, why are you doing what you're doing?
[02:13:13.089 --> 02:13:20.534]  Tell us about your position in government and why you decided to take the bull by the horns and move forward against our emperor.
[02:13:21.434 --> 02:13:28.879]  Well, my position... I'm a selectman on the board of selectmen of the town of Newfane, but I took this initiative simply as an American citizen.
[02:13:30.308 --> 02:13:32.970]  I feel, here I am, living in this country.
[02:13:33.370 --> 02:13:39.354]  My government is acting in an illegal way, in an immoral way, in a criminal way.
[02:13:40.234 --> 02:13:46.618]  And I said to myself, if I don't do anything, I mean, you know, I have it signed out at the end of my driveway with keeping track of how many people are getting killed daily in Iraq.
[02:13:47.259 --> 02:13:48.560]  But, you know, that's not very much.
[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:56.865]  But as in Vermont, we have town meeting, which is the annual meeting of everyone in the town who comes, where we legislate for the year.
[02:13:56.925 --> 02:13:57.926]  We approve the budget.
[02:13:57.986 --> 02:13:58.426]  It's an actual...
[02:13:59.139 --> 02:14:00.802]  Act of the Legislature.
[02:14:01.563 --> 02:14:12.322]  And by having that venue of town meeting, I realized if we put this on the wording or the agenda, an article to call for the impeachment of George Bush, I can get the whole town to debate the issue and we can...
[02:14:13.012 --> 02:14:17.054]  If we vote it out and if we vote in favor of it, that'll be a town speaking and not just myself.
[02:14:17.094 --> 02:14:20.896]  By the way, over 600 towns and cities have thrown out the Patriot Act.
[02:14:20.976 --> 02:14:22.276]  Seven states have done it.
[02:14:22.736 --> 02:14:35.122]  And I think this is something real and tangible the states can do, starting at the county and city level, to actually move to basically command the Congress to take action and to remove this criminal.
[02:14:35.856 --> 02:14:43.298]  Yes, and just hearing about what we were doing in Newfane, four other towns brought up the same resolution from the floor and voted it on the same day.
[02:14:43.318 --> 02:14:47.879]  The three I'm familiar with by overwhelming margins.
[02:14:48.019 --> 02:14:54.821]  So now we have multiple towns, four or five, calling for this and passing this?
[02:14:55.221 --> 02:14:55.421]  Yes.
[02:14:56.382 --> 02:15:01.063]  And we have our illustrious Bernie Sanders, who, you know, has always stood for good things,
[02:15:01.819 --> 02:15:06.321]  Sitting on the fence and hemming and hawing and saying, well, we're not really going to file articles of impeachment.
[02:15:06.781 --> 02:15:08.142]  Well, what do you expect from Democrats?
[02:15:08.162 --> 02:15:09.562]  They're totally owned by the same interests.
[02:15:09.642 --> 02:15:11.443]  Well, the thing is, is he's not a Democrat.
[02:15:11.483 --> 02:15:12.484]  He's the independent.
[02:15:12.524 --> 02:15:14.284]  He's Mr. Standalone.
[02:15:14.324 --> 02:15:14.745]  You're right.
[02:15:15.245 --> 02:15:16.485]  But he's running for Senate.
[02:15:16.765 --> 02:15:18.406]  And you know what happens when people run for Senate.
[02:15:18.466 --> 02:15:20.787]  He needs that big money from the warmongers.
[02:15:21.067 --> 02:15:24.789]  Let me get a comment from David Swanson, Aberdowningstreet.org.
[02:15:25.309 --> 02:15:27.490]  First off, how are you guys getting involved in this?
[02:15:28.599 --> 02:15:38.045]  Well, it's absolutely wonderful what towns and cities and political parties and organizations around the country are doing passing these resolutions.
[02:15:38.185 --> 02:15:49.313]  And we've got a page collecting all of them, ones that have passed and ones that are pending, if you go to impeachpac.org slash resolutions.
[02:15:50.493 --> 02:15:52.235]  We are encouraging...
[02:15:54.244 --> 02:16:04.590]  So you're acting as a nexus point or kind of a command base to supercharge local activists?
[02:16:05.410 --> 02:16:06.111]  Absolutely.
[02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:09.853]  So the way other towns were inspired this past weekend, Vermont,
[02:16:10.692 --> 02:16:14.714]  Other cities and towns around the country are inspired to follow suit.
[02:16:14.854 --> 02:16:29.140]  Well, I think one of the reasons should be not just lying premeditatively about WMDs, which we now even have the White House memos on, which are even more damning than Downing Street memos, in my opinion, is his counsels, his lawyers, saying he's above the law and him concurring.
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:30.881]  He needs to be removed right now.
[02:16:31.829 --> 02:16:34.411]  Yeah, it's way more than lying.
[02:16:34.591 --> 02:16:37.594]  You could even love the war in Iraq and still want to impeach Bush.
[02:16:38.135 --> 02:16:38.795]  We're bound.
[02:16:38.935 --> 02:16:43.439]  When the United States signs a treaty, we're bound by that treaty as the supreme law of the land.
[02:16:43.759 --> 02:16:47.743]  And we've broken the treaties on treatment of civilians and prisoners of war.
[02:16:47.763 --> 02:16:48.203]  Torture.
[02:16:48.784 --> 02:16:49.965]  And the FRISA Act.
[02:16:50.427 --> 02:16:53.829]  Very specifically stated, the president cannot go beyond the bounds of the FISA Act.
[02:16:53.849 --> 02:16:57.271]  That's only five years in prison for every person that violates that.
[02:16:57.291 --> 02:16:58.331]  He's admitted that he's done that.
[02:16:58.351 --> 02:17:02.914]  So you've got breaking national law, breaking supreme law by virtue of breaking your treaties.
[02:17:03.134 --> 02:17:04.875]  You don't even have to think about the other.
[02:17:04.915 --> 02:17:06.015]  That's enough to impeach right there.
[02:17:07.016 --> 02:17:07.996]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:17:08.016 --> 02:17:11.358]  We're going to go to break here, and I want to come back and cover whatever facets of this you want.
[02:17:11.398 --> 02:17:13.179]  We all need to go to after Downing Street.
[02:17:14.328 --> 02:17:19.210]  .org, and we need to get involved locally.
[02:17:19.650 --> 02:17:23.231]  We need to get every city out there to move for impeachment.
[02:17:23.731 --> 02:17:27.492]  This is a group openly trying to set up a dictatorship, and Congress is scared of them.
[02:17:28.193 --> 02:17:30.593]  That's the biggest reason you're not seeing more resistance.
[02:17:30.613 --> 02:17:36.295]  That's why 95 members of the Senate voted for the Patriot Act expansion this week, last week.
[02:17:36.816 --> 02:17:38.396]  Now Bush is going to sign it this week or next week.
[02:17:38.776 --> 02:17:40.197]  It's because people are scared.
[02:17:40.217 --> 02:17:41.097]  This isn't a joke.
[02:17:41.708 --> 02:17:43.623]  Bush is openly building concentration camps.
[02:17:45.965 --> 02:17:50.046]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[02:19:45.635 --> 02:19:47.216]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:19:47.616 --> 02:19:53.359]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:19:53.599 --> 02:19:58.722]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:19:59.082 --> 02:20:08.347]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:20:08.707 --> 02:20:13.649]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:20:13.969 --> 02:20:17.990]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:22.912]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:20:23.332 --> 02:20:29.194]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:49.792]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:20:49.952 --> 02:20:52.113]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:20:52.374 --> 02:21:02.480]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:05.122]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:21:35.635 --> 02:21:37.556]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalvinPureSoap.com.
[02:21:56.609 --> 02:22:03.793]  And he said that Bush's activities are going to cause the Democrats most assuredly to take control of the House and the Senate.
[02:22:03.893 --> 02:22:05.734]  It could be both, but surely one of them.
[02:22:06.174 --> 02:22:10.316]  And then he believes that impeachment proceedings will be brought forward against Bush.
[02:22:11.037 --> 02:22:19.401]  And listen, I supported the impeachment of Bill Clinton for his selling out ports to the Chinese and real issues, but none of that was ever brought up.
[02:22:19.922 --> 02:22:22.363]  They tried to get him on the dress and the cigars and all the rest of it.
[02:22:23.101 --> 02:22:25.562]  Well, then Bush needs to.
[02:22:25.602 --> 02:22:26.942]  We're obsessed with sexual issues.
[02:22:27.002 --> 02:22:31.664]  He's had gay porn stars in there at midnight dozens of times, and we know what Bush likes to do.
[02:22:31.684 --> 02:22:45.568]  I mean, I know that's very Christian, but seriously, folks, selling us out to all these foreign interests, the corruption, the bid-rigging, the war profiteering, saying he's a dictator, and that's what he said with these signing ceremonies.
[02:22:46.228 --> 02:22:49.789]  It's time to get rid of George Bush and send a message to the executive that...
[02:22:51.009 --> 02:22:53.150]  We got rid of a king 230 years ago.
[02:22:54.010 --> 02:23:03.874]  Going back to David Swanson, about downingstreet.org, links to that on infowars.com, and Dan DeWalt, who is a selectman there in Vermont.
[02:23:05.734 --> 02:23:08.636]  Gentlemen, there's so many things to talk about, both of you.
[02:23:08.676 --> 02:23:12.557]  What do you think is most important for the listeners to know right now about this process?
[02:23:12.857 --> 02:23:14.338]  Why is this process real?
[02:23:14.418 --> 02:23:15.338]  Why is this important?
[02:23:16.847 --> 02:23:17.487]  This is David.
[02:23:17.547 --> 02:23:23.848]  Well, there are three ways that we are actively pursuing that can make impeachment happen.
[02:23:24.428 --> 02:23:27.789]  One is through an investigation, the way Watergate happened.
[02:23:27.889 --> 02:23:33.970]  And Congressman John Conyers has a bill to create that investigation to make recommendations on impeachment.
[02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:37.831]  And it would look into many of the crimes that we've mentioned.
[02:23:38.271 --> 02:23:40.011]  And that's House Resolution 635, H-Res 635.
[02:23:43.496 --> 02:23:50.558]  Everyone should phone their Congress member right now and ask him or her why they have not yet co-sponsored that or whether they have.
[02:23:51.138 --> 02:23:55.199]  And we don't want another committee where Bush appoints Henry Kissinger as the head.
[02:23:55.239 --> 02:23:55.439]  No.
[02:23:56.119 --> 02:24:05.501]  This would create a strictly bipartisan select committee where the Democrats could not be blocked from pursuing any information.
[02:24:06.202 --> 02:24:07.642]  This would get the facts.
[02:24:08.226 --> 02:24:09.387]  Seriously uncovered.
[02:24:10.068 --> 02:24:12.690]  The second way... But, I mean, David, you say uncovered.
[02:24:13.290 --> 02:24:13.911]  We know.
[02:24:13.971 --> 02:24:21.437]  We have the new White House memos where they say, we'll stage somebody finding WMDs and inform it, we'll fly planes low, paint it up like the U.N.
[02:24:21.457 --> 02:24:22.758]  to get Saddam to shoot it down.
[02:24:23.099 --> 02:24:26.101]  I mean, there's red-handed right there.
[02:24:26.382 --> 02:24:32.046]  Right, and as Dan mentioned, the President has openly confessed on violating FISA.
[02:24:32.086 --> 02:24:32.467]  There are...
[02:24:33.274 --> 02:24:36.757]  Arguments for impeachment for which we need no more information.
[02:24:36.777 --> 02:24:39.819]  Well, he said even if they didn't approve Patriot Act, he would, quote, enforce it.
[02:24:39.839 --> 02:24:41.261]  I mean, that's totally delusional.
[02:24:42.041 --> 02:24:53.070]  Absolutely, which is why the second way you can get to impeachment is one that we are actively pursuing with a number of Congress members, and that is to cut to the chase and introduce articles of impeachment.
[02:24:53.651 --> 02:25:00.036]  And there's no reason that any Congress member should not make themselves an instant international hero and do that.
[02:25:00.752 --> 02:25:05.343]  And the third way is for a state legislature.
[02:25:06.115 --> 02:25:08.736]  To send charges of impeachment to the House.
[02:25:08.917 --> 02:25:09.917]  I've got Dr. Brady with me.
[02:25:09.957 --> 02:25:12.098]  He wanted to ask a question or make a statement.
[02:25:12.118 --> 02:25:12.418]  Go ahead.
[02:25:12.658 --> 02:25:12.979]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:13.079 --> 02:25:17.961]  I was just saying that I just so wish that Henry B. Gonzalez was still up there.
[02:25:18.001 --> 02:25:23.564]  He filibustered for hours and hours, you know, to impeach the first President Bush.
[02:25:23.584 --> 02:25:31.648]  Well, there's a new Gonzalez, Alberto Gonzalez, and he says Bush is above the law and he's the chief law enforcement goon trying to keep all this at bay.
[02:25:31.728 --> 02:25:32.669]  I'll continue, David.
[02:25:33.985 --> 02:25:45.494]  Well, yeah, the example of Congressman Gonzales introducing articles of impeachment by himself with tremendous courage is exactly what we need right now.
[02:25:45.795 --> 02:25:51.079]  And we need a group of courageous Congress members to do what the public demands, you know.
[02:25:51.179 --> 02:25:53.941]  And you mentioned that elections are coming up.
[02:25:54.322 --> 02:25:59.045]  The Democrats can't just sit back and count on the Republicans to defeat themselves.
[02:25:59.105 --> 02:26:03.449]  They need something to bring people out to the polls in an off year.
[02:26:04.005 --> 02:26:10.970]  And 85% of Democrats feel strongly that they want congressional candidates who support impeachment.
[02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:15.833]  By the way, I've had a lot of big Republicans on this broadcast who care about America.
[02:26:15.853 --> 02:26:19.316]  They say the Republicans need to lose control for this country.
[02:26:19.356 --> 02:26:21.037]  And again, I've been a Republican in the past.
[02:26:21.377 --> 02:26:24.179]  I campaigned for Republicans 10, 11 years ago before I woke up.
[02:26:24.199 --> 02:26:25.840]  And I believe both parties are very corrupt.
[02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:27.882]  But we are in danger of a dictatorship.
[02:26:28.182 --> 02:26:28.402]  We can't...
[02:26:30.954 --> 02:26:32.915]  Selectman, DeWalt, go ahead, sorry.
[02:26:33.136 --> 02:26:37.058]  We can't rely, you know, everyone says, well, we need the Democrats to do this, we need the Congressmen to do this.
[02:26:37.578 --> 02:26:42.262]  The Congressmen, the Democrats, are not going to do anything unless we put tremendous pressure on them.
[02:26:42.562 --> 02:26:49.066]  What has to happen is the people of this country, just like the citizens of Vermont, have to raise a clarion call, a drumbeat, saying...
[02:26:49.614 --> 02:26:52.677]  You have to get to work and do the job of the American people.
[02:26:52.757 --> 02:27:01.346]  And we're going to donate money and run personally against you if you don't do what we're telling you to do, impeach this tyrant.
[02:27:01.526 --> 02:27:02.147]  Well, that's darn right.
[02:27:02.207 --> 02:27:05.190]  And you know, Bernie Sanders has stood for a lot of good things for the state of Vermont.
[02:27:05.210 --> 02:27:09.454]  But if Bernie is not willing to stand up and do the thing that needs to be done now, he's going to lose support.
[02:27:09.735 --> 02:27:12.778]  Everyone in this country needs to be putting pressure on their congressperson.
[02:27:13.579 --> 02:27:13.899]  Daily.
[02:27:14.059 --> 02:27:15.000]  We'll stay there.
[02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:17.020]  I've got a few more questions for you on the other side.
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:19.701]  And we'll continue with Dr. Breeding and your phone calls after that.
[02:27:20.182 --> 02:27:23.063]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:27:23.483 --> 02:27:25.544]  This isn't a joke, it isn't a game, it isn't a drill.
[02:27:26.444 --> 02:27:30.045]  This is the real world right now that we're living in.
[02:27:30.125 --> 02:27:32.646]  We are in danger of total dictatorship.
[02:27:33.086 --> 02:27:34.487]  Bush must be removed.
[02:27:36.007 --> 02:27:36.948]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.408 --> 02:27:39.009]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.929 --> 02:27:42.610]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.805 --> 02:27:49.852]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:50.073 --> 02:27:53.479]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.659 --> 02:27:57.105]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:57.378 --> 02:28:00.620]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:06.122]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:28:06.142 --> 02:28:15.787]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:15.907 --> 02:28:17.267]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:28:17.287 --> 02:28:22.690]  I mean, the idea of working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:23.190 --> 02:28:27.634]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:27.714 --> 02:28:29.075]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:29.235 --> 02:28:33.919]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?

[02:29:45.415 --> 02:29:47.616]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?
[02:29:47.876 --> 02:30:00.578]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[02:30:00.819 --> 02:30:03.099]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[02:30:03.339 --> 02:30:04.681]  Your child will listen to you again.

[02:30:05.782 --> 02:30:08.685]  Change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation.

[02:30:15.613 --> 02:30:22.521]  When my son started having behavior problems, the Total Transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:30:22.761 --> 02:30:24.043]  We got immediate results.
[02:30:24.523 --> 02:30:26.644]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?
[02:30:27.084 --> 02:30:35.367]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior now with the Total Transformation, the program that helps stop defiance and backtalking.
[02:30:35.607 --> 02:30:36.948]  Your child will listen to you again.
[02:30:36.968 --> 02:30:37.868]  I guarantee it.
[02:30:38.108 --> 02:30:38.568]  Call now.

[02:30:39.008 --> 02:30:41.589]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.606 --> 02:30:54.907]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:13.106 --> 02:31:16.389]  To impeach George Bush, and that's wildly popular.
[02:31:16.489 --> 02:31:19.251]  The vast majority of Americans want out of the war.
[02:31:19.391 --> 02:31:20.311]  They know we're in trouble.
[02:31:20.492 --> 02:31:28.277]  The conservatives I know, who are not these lapdog conservatives that love George Bush, realize we're in deep trouble.
[02:31:28.317 --> 02:31:36.603]  I mean, Ron Paul said on this show, multiple times in the last month we've had him on, that we're in danger of a dictatorship, and that we're a near dictatorship now, and that Bush wants to be a dictator.
[02:31:37.635 --> 02:31:45.120]  And make no mistake, don't think Bush won't carry out terror attacks in this country or have his agents do it or provocateur it to legitimize what he's doing.
[02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:47.902]  We've got Republican memos, high level, confirmed on that.
[02:31:48.423 --> 02:31:49.523]  We're in grave danger.
[02:31:49.584 --> 02:32:00.511]  Look, a crew that will openly say they can torture small children in front of their parents and say that's good, the Nazis, this is important, I repeat this, didn't brag about torturing children in public.
[02:32:00.531 --> 02:32:01.072]  They just did it.
[02:32:01.892 --> 02:32:04.374]  You see, this is a new level in history.
[02:32:05.288 --> 02:32:05.929]  A new level.
[02:32:06.169 --> 02:32:09.551]  The Romans would just crucify somebody who they claimed was a crook and it was an adult.
[02:32:09.851 --> 02:32:11.493]  They didn't go around torturing children.
[02:32:11.513 --> 02:32:15.616]  I mean, even the Romans in their decline weren't throwing kids into the arena.
[02:32:16.596 --> 02:32:20.159]  This is a new level of evil and they're pushing it.
[02:32:21.165 --> 02:32:26.206]  Gentlemen, do you want to comment on just the psychopathic statements of administration officials?
[02:32:26.927 --> 02:32:31.368]  Because I don't think we can overlook this Bush declaring dictator power.
[02:32:32.548 --> 02:32:33.849]  Dan, will you comment on that?
[02:32:34.009 --> 02:32:43.211]  Yeah, I'll tell you, when they first came into power, you know, and Bush had all of his father's old cronies, I just thought, well, this is just a bunch of old fools and this ding-dong is president.
[02:32:43.371 --> 02:32:45.992]  Well, I realized pretty quickly afterwards...
[02:32:47.263 --> 02:32:55.187]  No, these people absolutely present the greatest danger, I mean, I'm only 50 years old, but they present the greatest danger I've ever seen in my lifetime to the nation.
[02:32:55.667 --> 02:33:07.193]  You know, we've made lots of mistakes as a nation, we've done some good things as a nation, but never before have we run the risk of making everything we stand for become past tense.
[02:33:07.653 --> 02:33:13.856]  And I think we're really facing that right now, and I think what their plans are for dictatorship, I don't know,
[02:33:14.409 --> 02:33:15.530]  How that works one way or the other.
[02:33:15.570 --> 02:33:20.455]  But I think that they are absolutely determined to do what they think they want to do.
[02:33:20.595 --> 02:33:23.958]  And I think whatever it takes, if they can do it without a dictatorship, that'll be good.
[02:33:24.059 --> 02:33:25.320]  If it takes more...
[02:33:26.207 --> 02:33:39.897]  Well, they've got Republican Senate chairmen of committees saying war protesters are fifth colonists and need to be arrested, and all their mouthpieces are on the radio and TV saying it, and fire teachers that criticize, no free speech.
[02:33:40.257 --> 02:33:41.458]  I mean, that's dictatorship.
[02:33:41.478 --> 02:33:46.261]  When they claim they're above the courts and above the Congress... Well, the new Patriot Act has a whole new classification.
[02:33:46.301 --> 02:33:47.562]  I think they call them harassers.
[02:33:48.202 --> 02:34:03.492]  It has a national police force, unlimited jurisdiction for Secret Service or their designates, and no protected official need be around for them to instantly declare that you were in violation of the safe zone, and you get a year and a half in prison starting.
[02:34:03.832 --> 02:34:05.353]  Yeah.
[02:34:05.593 --> 02:34:06.814]  That's no joke, and it's today.
[02:34:07.774 --> 02:34:10.636]  And Democrats, of course, overwhelmingly help pass that.
[02:34:11.977 --> 02:34:13.878]  That's why we need to take it upon ourselves as...
[02:34:15.452 --> 02:34:20.735]  Let me get a comment from David Swanson on that.
[02:34:20.775 --> 02:34:32.102]  David, why do you think psychologically, we know most of them are paid off, but Democratic leadership, why are they rolling over to this when it was wildly unpopular with their constituency?
[02:34:33.803 --> 02:34:43.049]  Well, among some Democrats, I think the resistance to holding the Republicans accountable and the Bush administration accountable is that they were complicit in the crimes.
[02:34:44.499 --> 02:34:50.646]  In other cases, it's fear of the media, and they will tell you that they are afraid of being called leftists by the media.
[02:34:50.746 --> 02:34:53.389]  By the supposed liberal media that's really CIA-run.
[02:34:54.109 --> 02:35:03.119]  Well, they all know that they don't actually fall for the idea that the media is liberal, but they don't stand up to the media, and they don't
[02:35:03.775 --> 02:35:11.459]  We recognize that if they united and stood up strong for where the majority of the public is, the media could not stop them.
[02:35:12.259 --> 02:35:16.081]  I think Dan is exactly right that we need to keep upping the pressure.
[02:35:16.281 --> 02:35:24.646]  We're organizing protests now, not outside their offices, in front of their houses, in front of the homes of Congress members.
[02:35:25.166 --> 02:35:29.048]  We are demanding an end to the war and impeachment of the president.
[02:35:30.003 --> 02:35:41.031]  We've set up a political action committee that is funding candidates for Congress, all of them challengers thus far, who say that their first act will be articles of impeachment against Bush.
[02:35:41.071 --> 02:35:45.334]  And that's why the elite is racing with these CIA-controlled electronic voting machines.
[02:35:46.534 --> 02:35:51.558]  But I tell you, folks, when you really start looking at all the indicators, we're in a world of trouble.
[02:35:52.519 --> 02:35:56.262]  I mean, we're living the equivalent of the Soviet or Nazi takeover.
[02:35:56.583 --> 02:36:00.806]  We're living in what the CIA has done in 50 other countries when they overthrow them.
[02:36:00.846 --> 02:36:02.007]  I mean, we're living in a coup.
[02:36:02.467 --> 02:36:03.728]  We're living in a takeover.
[02:36:03.789 --> 02:36:11.615]  And unfortunately, foreign lobbyists in most cases paid for those congressmen in women's houses, and so they're probably not even going to carry her out there protesting.
[02:36:11.815 --> 02:36:13.536]  I mean, I commend you for protesting them.
[02:36:13.556 --> 02:36:13.957]  Keep it up.
[02:36:14.017 --> 02:36:14.697]  It does good.
[02:36:14.717 --> 02:36:18.821]  At least we're talking about impeachment now, and Ron Paul saying it's going to happen.
[02:36:19.201 --> 02:36:19.661]  So I think...
[02:36:20.482 --> 02:36:26.506]  I think we're going there, but I think by really assessing how evil this elite is, I think that helps us win the battle.
[02:36:26.526 --> 02:36:30.168]  I don't think people, I mean, I have to consciously realize how evil they are.
[02:36:30.228 --> 02:36:33.450]  I mean, this is beyond classical evil.
[02:36:33.490 --> 02:36:38.253]  This is, I mean, we're facing, I want people to know, we are facing pure evil.
[02:36:38.633 --> 02:36:41.735]  Pure evil right now in this administration.
[02:36:41.755 --> 02:36:42.836]  They're going for broke.
[02:36:42.996 --> 02:36:45.938]  Dr. Breeding, can you comment on that as a psychologist?
[02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:51.133]  Well, first of all, I like taking the protest to people's houses.
[02:36:51.213 --> 02:36:54.235]  You know, I like really calling people.
[02:36:54.415 --> 02:37:13.209]  One of the phenomenons that Dr. Lifton wrote a book called Nazi Doctors, and he talked about this phenomenon of doubling, you know, where someone could be this nice family man with his wife and children, you know, but then go out and be a concentration camp supervisor on the side.
[02:37:13.509 --> 02:37:16.351]  You know, so politicians can go up there and support people
[02:37:16.651 --> 02:37:21.135]  This nefarious administration and then consider himself a good Christian family man at home.
[02:37:21.175 --> 02:37:24.898]  And so when you start breaking down those boundaries, I think that's really good.
[02:37:24.958 --> 02:37:29.181]  I think it confronts the psychological dynamic and it also exposes them.
[02:37:29.301 --> 02:37:31.142]  It makes more of an email or a phone call.
[02:37:31.162 --> 02:37:31.983]  You're like in their face.
[02:37:32.123 --> 02:37:33.044]  Hey, man, stop it.
[02:37:33.084 --> 02:37:33.885]  What you're doing is wrong.
[02:37:34.085 --> 02:37:34.325]  Go ahead.
[02:37:34.565 --> 02:37:35.606]  Yeah, so I like that.
[02:37:36.167 --> 02:37:37.509]  I think it affects every level.
[02:37:37.909 --> 02:37:47.741]  And you get in the neighborhood, and those are going to be the neighborhoods where everybody is afraid and cowed, and there you are making a scene, and there's the most respected member of the neighborhood.
[02:37:47.761 --> 02:37:48.562]  He's in the U.S.
[02:37:48.622 --> 02:37:50.824]  Congress, and there's people in his front yard.
[02:37:50.884 --> 02:37:51.285]  I like it.
[02:37:51.974 --> 02:37:53.114]  Yeah, that's very well said.
[02:37:53.134 --> 02:37:56.335]  That's exactly what we had in mind in putting that together, you know.
[02:37:57.035 --> 02:38:00.175]  And, you know, I've spoken to soldiers, U.S.
[02:38:00.215 --> 02:38:03.856]  soldiers who've been over to Iraq, and many of them come back and oppose the war.
[02:38:03.996 --> 02:38:06.757]  Seventy-two percent are now won out.
[02:38:06.797 --> 02:38:08.757]  That are there now, want to come home within a year.
[02:38:09.277 --> 02:38:19.119]  But I've spoken to some who've defended what they did, for example, in Fallujah and other cities and towns we haven't even heard about that have been leveled, where we've melted the skin off children.
[02:38:19.899 --> 02:38:20.719]  And they argue...
[02:38:21.195 --> 02:38:28.996]  That we were justified in using these chemical weapons and this depleted uranium because the town was harboring terrorists.
[02:38:29.457 --> 02:38:33.080]  And what that means is there were some suspected to be some people in this city.
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:39.745]  Yeah, that means let's say Austin, Texas has four supposed terrorists who hung Blackwater terrorists up from lamp poles.
[02:38:40.426 --> 02:38:50.453]  And so because that happened, we're now going to nuke Austin and kill everyone in a million plus metro area because four people did something wrong.
[02:38:50.574 --> 02:38:53.296]  It's pure psychopathic excuses.
[02:38:53.776 --> 02:38:54.296]  That's right.
[02:38:54.497 --> 02:38:54.937]  That's right.
[02:38:54.977 --> 02:38:58.680]  And these vets are wonderful people with their family and friends.
[02:38:59.198 --> 02:39:02.381]  But they justify doing that to Iraqi families.
[02:39:02.421 --> 02:39:07.086]  And there's a group of Iraqi women now traveling around this country telling their stories.
[02:39:07.306 --> 02:39:11.870]  And it's stuff that you have never heard in the American media.
[02:39:12.030 --> 02:39:12.771]  And it just breaks your heart.
[02:39:12.791 --> 02:39:13.932]  Well, I know it's confirmed.
[02:39:13.952 --> 02:39:19.237]  I mean, it's been all over foreign mainstream press where they get video of it or take photos or are there as it happens.
[02:39:19.277 --> 02:39:22.080]  And they're just shooting women with children for fun.
[02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:23.862]  They're just going to watch me splatter this bleeper.
[02:39:24.463 --> 02:39:38.729]  And the head just splatters, and they all hoop and yell and do high fives, and the woman's holding a three-year-old as they walk down the dirt road trying to get food, and the baby just looks, they're standing over their splattered head, and there's a bunch of animals rolling around, basically getting sexual pleasure off of it.
[02:39:38.929 --> 02:39:45.292]  And those pieces of psychopathic trash are going to come back here and be cops, and they're going to man the concentration camps.
[02:39:45.552 --> 02:39:48.773]  That's what these wars are about, is growing sickos.
[02:39:49.153 --> 02:39:52.675]  And gentlemen, what about Halliburton and the camps for the citizens?
[02:39:53.355 --> 02:40:02.519]  I think when you're talking about, you know, the evil in the Bush administration, I think you're missing a large point, which is way different than just, you know, somebody's psychology.
[02:40:02.939 --> 02:40:08.702]  That is, corporations in this country have not only the Bush administration, but the Democrats in their pocket.
[02:40:08.882 --> 02:40:11.323]  And, you know, whether they're evil or not isn't even the question.
[02:40:11.743 --> 02:40:13.264]  This is a matter of business.
[02:40:14.051 --> 02:40:16.032]  It's important for the corporations... No, you're right.
[02:40:16.072 --> 02:40:17.352]  They don't look at what they do.
[02:40:17.632 --> 02:40:23.214]  They don't get down there in the baby brains and the piles of rotten dead bodies with the maggots all over them.
[02:40:23.394 --> 02:40:33.037]  They sit up there in their $50 million houses with their three mistresses all oiled and pampered smoking Cuban cigars while this country's going to hell in a handbasket!
[02:40:35.437 --> 02:40:37.638]  Yeah, I think that you're exactly right.
[02:40:38.479 --> 02:40:53.864]  You know, and it's so blatant, and it's become so obvious, and from presidents up from George Washington through Bill Clinton, you had about 320 signing statements where you sign a bill and then you say what you meant, what the law is really going to mean.
[02:40:54.304 --> 02:41:02.487]  George Bush has done that 435 times, once for every member of Congress, all on his own, and he's completely rewritten what the laws are.
[02:41:02.527 --> 02:41:03.728]  So we could have Congress
[02:41:04.272 --> 02:41:11.516]  Pass a bill cutting off funding for the war, and the president could sign it and say, this means the war will end in 15 years.
[02:41:12.056 --> 02:41:17.139]  And we have no other choice but to impeach and remove from office.
[02:41:17.839 --> 02:41:20.861]  Otherwise, you know, we have no guarantees of anything.
[02:41:20.981 --> 02:41:23.502]  And see, I can't believe it happened this fast.
[02:41:24.282 --> 02:41:27.804]  They engineered one attack, and I'll just say it, and there's no bones about it.
[02:41:27.864 --> 02:41:29.305]  I said it first, I'll say it, they did it.
[02:41:29.938 --> 02:41:31.159]  They staged this attack.
[02:41:31.199 --> 02:41:33.000]  We have their own documents saying they were going to do it.
[02:41:33.461 --> 02:41:39.866]  And then now the murdering terrorist sits up there and tells us he's a dictator and that he can torture little kids.
[02:41:40.466 --> 02:41:42.488]  I mean, it's just, it's disgusting.
[02:41:43.008 --> 02:41:44.089]  It's disgusting.
[02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:52.475]  And, gentlemen, in closing, any other comments you want to push to the listeners out there that may want to fight this Hitlerian administration?
[02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:57.079]  Well, I would say if Bill O'Reilly can flood the state of Vermont with
[02:41:57.577 --> 02:42:04.181]  Thousands of emails complaining about a judge because he's trying to make sure that a guy gets treatment so he's not going to be an abuser when he gets out of prison.
[02:42:04.841 --> 02:42:17.489]  And I would hope that your listeners can flood their congressmen and my congressmen with emails and letters saying, get off the stick and get serious about dealing with this war and dealing with this president.
[02:42:18.709 --> 02:42:19.850]  I agree.
[02:42:19.890 --> 02:42:20.851]  I second everything.
[02:42:21.151 --> 02:42:26.714]  And I would say demand that your congressmember introduce articles of impeachment against Bush and Cheney
[02:42:27.350 --> 02:42:34.616]  Or if they will not and say they need the facts and they need an investigation, make sure they are co-sponsoring House Resolution 635.
[02:42:35.036 --> 02:42:41.201]  If we get a lot of co-sponsors on there and we're at 28, we can move this forward.
[02:42:41.601 --> 02:42:45.384]  And go to ImpeachPAC.org and give us $5, give us $1,000.
[02:42:46.185 --> 02:42:49.887]  We're funding Congress members who will impeach these guys.
[02:42:51.449 --> 02:42:53.590]  Well, it's serious.
[02:42:55.091 --> 02:42:56.873]  Mr. DeWalt, any other comments from you?
[02:42:57.597 --> 02:42:57.777]  Nope.
[02:42:57.917 --> 02:43:00.840]  I would just say the time to act is now.
[02:43:00.880 --> 02:43:03.783]  We can no longer sit on our hands because we could be complicit.
[02:43:03.843 --> 02:43:05.904]  If we don't act, we're part of the crime.
[02:43:06.965 --> 02:43:07.146]  All right.
[02:43:07.166 --> 02:43:08.146]  I appreciate you joining us.
[02:43:08.206 --> 02:43:08.587]  Take care.
[02:43:08.607 --> 02:43:09.307]  All right.
[02:43:09.608 --> 02:43:10.408]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:43:10.428 --> 02:43:17.355]  I want to get some final comments from Dr. Brady and take a few final calls for those that have been holding forever, and I need to find out on the phone list what's updated here in a minute.
[02:43:20.541 --> 02:43:21.622]  This was all done by design.
[02:43:21.662 --> 02:43:35.214]  They're going to let the Republicans become the image of a demon, and they're going to put Democrats in later who will continue carrying out the policies, and then so-called conservatism itself, things that are important like the Second Amendment to protect ourselves from these tyrants, and other things are going to be demonized further.
[02:43:35.254 --> 02:43:39.578]  And it's all set up by design, but we have got to punish the executive now.
[02:43:40.419 --> 02:43:43.721]  Because clearly the elite wants an imperial executive.
[02:43:43.862 --> 02:43:44.802]  Bush is just their puppet.
[02:43:45.182 --> 02:43:49.706]  This is the globalists want this dictatorship of their own control.
[02:43:50.326 --> 02:43:51.267]  And this is classical.
[02:43:51.287 --> 02:43:52.948]  I mean, Bush is announcing he's a dictator.
[02:43:52.968 --> 02:44:00.593]  You know, the jokes of 2000 and 2001 of I was a dictator, you know, things would be a lot better just as long as, you know, I'm a dictator.
[02:44:00.613 --> 02:44:01.534]  In fact, grab that clip.
[02:44:01.834 --> 02:44:03.355]  Scott, can you find that and get that ready?
[02:44:03.395 --> 02:44:06.878]  I want to play that audio for folks that haven't heard it.
[02:44:06.918 --> 02:44:09.880]  But Dr. Breeding, comments on the discussion that we've just had.
[02:44:11.147 --> 02:44:18.510]  Well, I'm glad that Dan and the other man are active on this, just like thousands of other people.
[02:44:18.610 --> 02:44:25.654]  And I put an impeach Bush sign out in my yard every other day or so just to hold the focus in my little neighborhood.
[02:44:25.734 --> 02:44:34.018]  And I'm encouraging Lloyd Doggett, another liberal Democrat who does a lot of good things, but is reluctant to impeach Bush for I don't know what reason.
[02:44:34.578 --> 02:44:35.358]  So I agree.
[02:44:35.678 --> 02:44:37.039]  I think he's bought and paid for it.
[02:44:37.848 --> 02:44:42.731]  Okay, so putting pressure on him and everybody else and holding the image.
[02:44:42.751 --> 02:44:46.133]  I really believe in this thing of holding the image of something.
[02:44:46.173 --> 02:44:48.674]  And so I just see Bush as impeached.
[02:44:49.215 --> 02:44:52.297]  And he's been impeached in my mind and your mind for a long time.
[02:44:52.337 --> 02:44:53.717]  You know, he's not our president.
[02:44:54.378 --> 02:44:58.400]  And so we do whatever we can to put him in his proper place.
[02:44:58.420 --> 02:45:00.001]  So I just totally support that.
[02:45:00.021 --> 02:45:01.942]  Well, a couple of years ago, I said he was a puppet.
[02:45:02.022 --> 02:45:03.323]  And then, you know, just ignore him.
[02:45:03.363 --> 02:45:03.964]  It's the elites.
[02:45:04.004 --> 02:45:06.265]  But clearly, they're trying to make him an emperor.
[02:45:06.954 --> 02:45:08.996]  And he's already the son of the former president.
[02:45:09.016 --> 02:45:13.642]  It's like North Korea where his, you know, the son of the leader is the, I mean, just everything here.
[02:45:13.682 --> 02:45:15.264]  It's just really bad.
[02:45:15.564 --> 02:45:20.730]  Yeah, and I don't mean to say it's enough to ignore it because you don't ignore somebody who's beaten the hell out of your child.
[02:45:21.544 --> 02:45:23.586]  Well, clearly Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld and
[02:45:43.985 --> 02:45:53.091]  Rice and Gonzalez and all those people are very, very disabled and unable to think in terms of humanity and in terms of connection.
[02:45:53.111 --> 02:45:58.515]  They're able to think intellectually and scheme and plan and wreak havoc and destruction, and that's why it needs to be interrupted.
[02:45:58.575 --> 02:46:01.937]  Yeah, they think we're weak because we don't want anything to do with murdering toddlers.
[02:46:02.497 --> 02:46:03.678]  I mean, really, I keep talking about that.
[02:46:03.698 --> 02:46:04.539]  I want you to image that.
[02:46:04.559 --> 02:46:05.819]  I want you to go look at the pictures.
[02:46:05.839 --> 02:46:06.680]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:46:07.529 --> 02:46:12.174]  There's murdering toddlers, there's a torturer, and there's literally the destruction of toddlers.
[02:46:12.214 --> 02:46:15.797]  The biggest growth market in psychiatric drugs today is toddlers.
[02:46:16.558 --> 02:46:21.663]  You know, so we've got hundreds of thousands of two-, three-, four-year-olds on these psychotropic drugs now.
[02:46:21.723 --> 02:46:23.625]  And they're going to be screwed up their whole lives.
[02:46:23.645 --> 02:46:28.710]  Yeah, but a very, very large percent of them are being made into chronic mental patients.
[02:46:30.134 --> 02:46:41.219]  You know, we've got one out of 50 adult Americans on permanent disability for so-called mental illness, and it's mostly as a result of this, what my one friend lawyer calls the pharma cost.
[02:46:42.159 --> 02:46:42.900]  And it is.
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:44.460]  It's a tremendous destruction.
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:50.743]  In fact, when you see someone on these drugs for a few years, then the chance of incarceration goes way up that we all then pay for.
[02:46:50.763 --> 02:46:55.245]  Go ahead and roll that clip of one of his dictator quotes as he snickers and giggles.
[02:46:55.785 --> 02:46:59.567]  I hope they've got my sense of optimism about the possible.
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:03.724]  And enthusiasm about the job.
[02:47:05.185 --> 02:47:10.151]  I've told all four that there can be some times where we don't agree with each other.
[02:47:11.492 --> 02:47:12.153]  But that's okay.
[02:47:12.173 --> 02:47:15.677]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:47:17.219 --> 02:47:18.480]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:47:21.778 --> 02:47:25.619]  We're going to come back and take two or three final calls for those that have been holding on the long march here.
[02:47:25.639 --> 02:47:27.159]  We had all these great guests on today.
[02:47:27.239 --> 02:47:38.362]  But, Dr. Brady, I do carry both of your books, and one of them, of course, is The Wildest Cults Make the Best Horses, getting into what Redland does, and they target our best and brightest.
[02:47:38.822 --> 02:47:39.903]  And then tell them about the other book.
[02:47:40.523 --> 02:47:48.845]  The other one is called True Nature and Great Misunderstandings, and it's really relevant to our topic, you know, the true nature of humans being to be connected and caring and compassionate.
[02:47:49.725 --> 02:47:50.946]  And loving towards each other.
[02:47:50.966 --> 02:47:54.908]  And you can get those individually or together and save, I think, like $10 when you get them both.
[02:47:55.428 --> 02:48:02.631]  And then also, we have a 3-package deal where you also get Dr. Eisenstein's medical doctor's book about how deadly vaccines are.
[02:48:03.472 --> 02:48:09.174]  It's the parenting special, three books, or get the two books or get one of those three books.
[02:48:09.495 --> 02:48:13.977]  And we've got that featured up on the main page of InfoWars.com right now.
[02:48:14.898 --> 02:48:18.283]  Go to that secure online shopping cart, get my videos, get the books we offer.
[02:48:18.323 --> 02:48:22.449]  We're really expanding it, and your purchase also makes possible this broadcast.
[02:48:22.529 --> 02:48:29.320]  What we're doing, what my team's doing, what the websites are doing, everything that we're engaging in is about
[02:48:30.083 --> 02:48:30.644]  Surviving.
[02:48:30.724 --> 02:48:34.147]  I mean, during the breaks, we're in here talking about dictatorship and the country.
[02:48:34.227 --> 02:48:36.069]  I mean, this is real.
[02:48:36.109 --> 02:48:37.110]  This isn't what I put on.
[02:48:37.651 --> 02:48:38.832]  This is real.
[02:48:39.152 --> 02:48:40.133]  We are under attack.
[02:48:40.213 --> 02:48:41.034]  We are in danger.
[02:48:41.074 --> 02:48:42.896]  You need to get informed and inform others.
[02:48:43.256 --> 02:48:44.177]  Get these books today.
[02:48:44.217 --> 02:48:44.738]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:47.105 --> 02:48:49.948]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.208 --> 02:48:51.790]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.130 --> 02:48:56.795]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.135 --> 02:49:03.882]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.202 --> 02:49:06.184]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.384 --> 02:49:09.206]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.326 --> 02:49:13.989]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:18.593]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.833 --> 02:49:26.058]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.319 --> 02:49:28.741]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.901 --> 02:49:30.642]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:46.101 --> 02:49:54.343]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:54.603 --> 02:49:58.964]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:59.265 --> 02:50:08.167]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:08.367 --> 02:50:11.988]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:12.288 --> 02:50:17.316]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:17.616 --> 02:50:24.366]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:24.847 --> 02:50:25.388]  What about you?
[02:50:26.047 --> 02:50:26.727]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:50:26.747 --> 02:50:28.068]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.

[02:50:53.507 --> 02:50:55.750]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[02:51:32.159 --> 02:51:35.241]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.421 --> 02:51:41.345]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.887 --> 02:51:49.049]  We're going to take three final calls.
[02:51:49.089 --> 02:51:51.010]  We're going to move quickly from Evan, Tom, and Walter.
[02:51:51.070 --> 02:51:52.231]  That's going to be it.
[02:51:52.251 --> 02:51:53.632]  I'm sorry about all the other calls.
[02:51:53.652 --> 02:52:00.016]  We were talking during the break about how detectors all over the Western world are picking up eight times the safe levels of depleted uranium.
[02:52:00.951 --> 02:52:02.072]  It's the exact isotope.
[02:52:02.092 --> 02:52:03.052]  They know where it's coming from.
[02:52:03.072 --> 02:52:03.813]  They know what's happening.
[02:52:03.833 --> 02:52:04.833]  It's blowing all over the place.
[02:52:04.853 --> 02:52:07.295]  They've used tens of thousands of tons all over the planet.
[02:52:07.895 --> 02:52:09.376]  And the elites kids are breathing this too.
[02:52:09.436 --> 02:52:11.197]  It just shows the total disconnect.
[02:52:11.217 --> 02:52:12.398]  They're totally in denial.
[02:52:12.778 --> 02:52:13.979]  They're a bunch of nutcases.
[02:52:14.659 --> 02:52:15.700]  Let's take some final calls.
[02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:16.921]  Evan in Reno, Nevada.
[02:52:16.941 --> 02:52:17.481]  You're on the air.
[02:52:17.501 --> 02:52:17.841]  Welcome.
[02:52:19.762 --> 02:52:21.443]  We need to dope you up, Alex.
[02:52:21.704 --> 02:52:22.564]  Get you off the air.
[02:52:23.164 --> 02:52:23.405]  I know.
[02:52:23.485 --> 02:52:24.345]  I'm too hyper.
[02:52:24.385 --> 02:52:26.206]  The Soviets would arrest me saying I'm a dissident.
[02:52:26.246 --> 02:52:27.227]  I'm mentally ill.
[02:52:27.267 --> 02:52:28.808]  And there's no court proceedings because I'm crazy.
[02:52:29.562 --> 02:52:31.105]  Alright, well I only had a couple of things.
[02:52:31.305 --> 02:52:36.895]  I just got an iPod and I started podcasting you and there's only like one so far.
[02:52:36.955 --> 02:52:39.920]  I'm wondering if you guys are going to start podcasting every episode?
[02:52:40.498 --> 02:52:43.821]  You know, my guys are... I've told my people to start podcasting.
[02:52:43.861 --> 02:52:44.681]  We've hired more people.
[02:52:45.001 --> 02:52:46.823]  We do podcasting only a few a week.
[02:52:47.143 --> 02:52:49.565]  We need to put more of the shows up there to podcast.
[02:52:49.965 --> 02:52:51.726]  And yes, sir, email my people.
[02:52:51.746 --> 02:52:53.628]  I'm going to go prod them after the show.
[02:52:53.648 --> 02:52:57.171]  But yeah, we need to get more podcasts, more of the interviews up there for you.
[02:52:57.471 --> 02:52:58.532]  Tell Lord Watson.
[02:52:58.572 --> 02:52:59.512]  He's supposed to be doing that.
[02:53:00.273 --> 02:53:01.674]  That would be awesome if I could get every show.
[02:53:01.694 --> 02:53:04.216]  The only other thing was I thought I'd bring up is... Not every show.
[02:53:04.236 --> 02:53:05.377]  You'll just get some of the interviews.
[02:53:05.617 --> 02:53:07.158]  You want every show, get it from the network.
[02:53:07.178 --> 02:53:08.159]  They've got a deal where you can do that.
[02:53:08.732 --> 02:53:14.677]  Okay, the other thing is, I don't know, do you know about Michael Edward Bell from Kenosha, Wisconsin?
[02:53:15.558 --> 02:53:19.241]  He was shot in the head by the KPD Police Department.
[02:53:19.261 --> 02:53:19.862]  Yeah, they admitted it.
[02:53:19.882 --> 02:53:20.782]  They said, lay on the ground.
[02:53:20.822 --> 02:53:26.127]  He laid on the ground, and I got the report, and they shot him in the head, and then the government said, we're allowed to kill you.
[02:53:27.148 --> 02:53:30.090]  Yeah, I was just wondering if you knew about that story or not.
[02:53:30.431 --> 02:53:33.713]  Yes, I actually have it here in front of me, and I believe we did post it.
[02:53:33.753 --> 02:53:34.314]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:34.414 --> 02:53:35.395]  Dr. Breeding, comments on that?
[02:53:38.258 --> 02:53:40.600]  It's unspeakable, so we're speaking it.
[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:42.341]  You speak the truth, declare the truth.
[02:53:43.662 --> 02:53:46.784]  I mean, they used to, cops shot an innocent person because they were trigger happy.
[02:53:46.804 --> 02:53:47.745]  The cop got in trouble.
[02:53:48.125 --> 02:53:49.987]  Now the government just says, no, he's not getting in trouble.
[02:53:50.487 --> 02:53:52.568]  And then that makes all good cops look bad.
[02:53:52.849 --> 02:53:54.069]  Let's talk to Tom and KC.
[02:53:54.090 --> 02:53:54.870]  You're on the air, Tom.
[02:53:55.210 --> 02:53:56.171]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:53:57.152 --> 02:54:00.814]  I'd just like to hit two real quick points of information that I found out yesterday.
[02:54:01.054 --> 02:54:04.657]  One, well, we all know the Patriot Act just passed on its way to go to the press.
[02:54:04.857 --> 02:54:05.738]  Radically expanded.
[02:54:06.827 --> 02:54:20.043]  One thing that gave me a sickening knot in my stomach was that the Feds now have the right to go into your lawyer's office, take all your records with a warrant that the police write themselves, then tell your lawyer, don't say a word, you'll go to prison.
[02:54:20.323 --> 02:54:21.264]  Yeah, that's not a warrant.
[02:54:21.505 --> 02:54:24.408]  Yeah, that's tyranny, blatant tyranny with, you know, a government okay.
[02:54:24.528 --> 02:54:24.829]  Second...
[02:54:25.569 --> 02:54:31.990]  I just found out yesterday, too, that the government is going into the National Archives and reclassifying a lot of declassified documents.
[02:54:32.010 --> 02:54:38.011]  I know, because you can go read all the declassified stuff where they admit they carried out terror attacks, so now they're classifying those very documents.
[02:54:38.251 --> 02:54:38.831]  Yes, they are.
[02:54:39.231 --> 02:54:45.072]  And the thing that really scared me is they're doing it all... So far, they've dipped all the way up to documents into the 50s.
[02:54:45.412 --> 02:54:47.413]  You know, it's basically 1984, man.
[02:54:47.453 --> 02:54:49.153]  Newspeak, going into rewriting history, you know?
[02:54:49.193 --> 02:54:50.473]  It's going in the memory hole.
[02:54:50.533 --> 02:54:51.333]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:51.393 --> 02:54:52.094]  Such great callers.
[02:54:52.114 --> 02:54:53.134]  Wish we'd had them on longer.
[02:54:53.374 --> 02:54:54.834]  Dr. Breeding, comments on the memory hole?
[02:54:55.808 --> 02:54:57.149]  Well, here's a comment.
[02:54:57.249 --> 02:55:18.564]  I think the attitude is to assume that we're all political prisoners and to just take an attitude that everyone in prison is a political prisoner and that anyone who goes to prison as a result of standing up to this tyranny, if the leaders are on the outside of prison, then maybe being in prison is the right side to be in.
[02:55:18.924 --> 02:55:21.766]  But just a willingness to be in brotherhood with people
[02:55:22.302 --> 02:55:24.084]  Everybody who's on the wrong side of the law.
[02:55:24.184 --> 02:55:24.824]  Final call.
[02:55:24.884 --> 02:55:26.165]  Walter in New Jersey.
[02:55:26.185 --> 02:55:26.706]  You're on the air.
[02:55:26.786 --> 02:55:27.226]  Go ahead.
[02:55:28.247 --> 02:55:29.628]  Good afternoon, Alex and Doctor.
[02:55:29.648 --> 02:55:31.290]  This is Walter Burian.
[02:55:31.310 --> 02:55:32.471]  I want to get you on sometime.
[02:55:33.191 --> 02:55:36.394]  We're not going into break, are we?
[02:55:36.795 --> 02:55:38.116]  Yeah, the show's over, brother.
[02:55:39.149 --> 02:55:44.132]  You know, I didn't know it was Walter Burien with the reports on the real set of books.
[02:55:44.152 --> 02:55:45.113]  Let me get your number.
[02:55:45.493 --> 02:55:46.694]  Comprehensive Annual Finance Report.
[02:55:46.834 --> 02:55:49.235]  Yeah, yeah, let me get your... I recognize your voice instantly.
[02:55:49.275 --> 02:55:50.556]  I got a video out with you in it.
[02:55:51.217 --> 02:55:52.978]  Let me put you on hold at the end of the show.
[02:55:52.998 --> 02:55:53.858]  Let me get your number, okay?
[02:55:53.878 --> 02:55:57.741]  Okay, and I had a very good comment on my guy, and I'll be able to get it in.
[02:55:58.201 --> 02:56:00.102]  Go ahead.
[02:56:00.242 --> 02:56:03.224]  I'm 50 years old, and I remember my grandfather's the way they thought.
[02:56:04.506 --> 02:56:15.815]  And, you know, what a big difference I see today is that everything that is happening, if our grandfather saw it happening, I'd love to own stock in a baseball back company because they'd pick him up and start busting a few heads.
[02:56:16.376 --> 02:56:17.537]  We're conditioned to do nothing.
[02:56:19.158 --> 02:56:19.638]  I hear you.
[02:56:19.658 --> 02:56:20.259]  Stay there, Walter.
[02:56:20.279 --> 02:56:22.561]  I want to talk to you when this transmission ends in five seconds.
[02:56:22.661 --> 02:56:23.421]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.441 --> 02:56:25.043]  Get out there and pick up a new award.
[02:56:25.743 --> 02:56:30.407]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
