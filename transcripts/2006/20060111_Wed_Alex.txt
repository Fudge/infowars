[00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:06.906]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.626]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:10.487]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.087 --> 00:00:11.907]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:13.628]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:18.169]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.511]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:47.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, big broadcast lined up for you on this live Wednesday edition, the 11th day already of January 2006.
[00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.154]  We'll be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:51.194 --> 00:01:02.197]  We've got Dr. Dennis Cuddy, expert on the New World Order, joining us to talk about cover-ups, government spin, and the truth, and we'll also
[00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:06.535]  We'll get into the faith-based initiatives, taking over the churches.
[00:01:06.575 --> 00:01:09.117]  We'll get into the New Freedom Initiative.
[00:01:09.457 --> 00:01:12.698]  It's now moving forward for forced psychological testing and drugging.
[00:01:13.078 --> 00:01:17.240]  Already passed, the House and Senate signed last year into law by Bush.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.941]  Now they're trying to implement that.
[00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:26.144]  We'll also get into the War on Terror, the whole New World Order structure, you name it, in the second hour.
[00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:31.506]  Then in the third hour, my good buddy, talk show host on this network, Pastor Butch Paw,
[00:01:32.907 --> 00:01:39.651]  And of course he himself was in military intelligence over in Vietnam, in some countries they weren't even supposed to be in.
[00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:43.993]  Just an interesting character on that level, which we've never gotten him to talk about.
[00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:47.255]  Maybe he'll talk a little bit about what he did in Cambodia today.
[00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:54.159]  But he's a pastor in West Virginia, and somewhat controversial because he actually reads the Bible and actually tries to follow it.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.482]  And we'll be talking about what he calls the pulpit prostitutes.
[00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:08.421]  And their 501c3 status and how the church has been taken over and the war and the New World Order and all of it in the third hour.
[00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:09.322]  Interesting fella.
[00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:10.662]  Always a great guest.
[00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:14.925]  You don't want to miss that coming up in the third hour today.
[00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:31.612]  We will also, we didn't take any calls yesterday because I had two guests, Paul Watson and also had a professor on, a historian on about Andrew Jackson, one of the lesser known presidents, though he's probably the most influential and quote, greatest president we've ever had.
[00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:37.413]  The greatest effect is what I predominantly mean by that.
[00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:44.575]  So that is coming up, of course, later in the show we will talk to Dr. Dennis Cuddy and Pastor Butch Paul as well.
[00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:47.415]  A lot of news here!
[00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:48.216]  Oh boy!
[00:02:48.336 --> 00:02:51.858]  Report MS-13 gang hired to murder Border Patrol.
[00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:54.460]  And this is out of the Daily Bulletin.
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.244]  And I remember talking to one of the chief Border Patrol officers in Texas about eight years ago, and he said they had bounties on their heads.
[00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:05.187]  And this is really old news, but it's now hitting mainstream news.
[00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:09.490]  Also, Bush planned war with Iraq long before 9-11 attacks.
[00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.012]  New evidence emerges of this to the
[00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:29.467]  To the plethora, the galaxy of other eyewitnesses, from himself to Dick Cheney saying it in their own writings, to their own biographer, to the Secretary of the Treasury, to security advisors, well now they've got campaign
[00:03:30.462 --> 00:03:32.064]  Uh, staffers saying it.
[00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:34.646]  I mean, this has been their plan all along.
[00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:36.528]  Very strategic.
[00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.572]  The strategia of all of this is very sophisticated.
[00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:45.537]  Also, the cost of the Iraq War could top two trillion dollars.
[00:03:45.898 --> 00:03:46.939]  That's a new study out.
[00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.861]  This is being carried by Reuters.
[00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:57.175]  You see, if they're there decades, $2 trillion, if they were there a few weeks and actually got rid of Saddam, only $100 bill or so.
[00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.056]  Now what would you rather have as a globalist?
[00:03:59.456 --> 00:04:00.276]  $100 bill or $2 trillion?
[00:04:02.324 --> 00:04:02.985]  I don't know.
[00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:03.945]  What would you want?
[00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:05.826]  Hunter Biddle or Tutrell?
[00:04:05.887 --> 00:04:06.447]  What's bigger?
[00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:10.610]  Iraq races for civil war and basically they're already in civil war.
[00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.610]  We'll get into that report.
[00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:17.394]  I want to go back to Senator Frank Church and the NSA could enable a dictator to impose total tyranny.
[00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:25.620]  Frank Church was one of the greater senators in modern history and he exposed a lot of the police state things that are going on.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.042]  So we'll go back over some of his famous quotes.
[00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:46.926]  When we get into National Security Agency mounted massive spy op on Baltimore Peace Group documents show no connection to foreign groups and the new Supreme Court nominee said yesterday that the president is not above the law but in past documents he says he is.
[00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.663]  So we'll get into that.
[00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:55.433]  And the New York Times writer that got killed, he'd written an article about Bush being above the law.
[00:04:55.473 --> 00:05:00.122]  And evidence is starting to show it was a hit of some type, meant to look like a mugging.
[00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:05.886]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:07.728]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:08.068 --> 00:05:12.731]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:19.817]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:22.119]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.162]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.262 --> 00:05:29.926]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:34.530]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.977]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:44.679]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:02.302 --> 00:06:13.027]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:20.731]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.971 --> 00:06:21.371]  I don't know.
[00:06:36.983 --> 00:06:40.886]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:42.827]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:48.971]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:09.207]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:14.429]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:22.692]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:29.874]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:30.094 --> 00:07:31.295]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:34.837]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:34.897 --> 00:07:36.018]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:36.298 --> 00:07:37.579]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:44.604]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:44.724 --> 00:07:47.186]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:07:50.368 --> 00:07:51.389]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:54.752]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:31.492]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the second segment.
[00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:35.034]  We're now 8 minutes, 30 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:38.436]  Again, Dr. Dennis Cuddy, expert on the New World Order.
[00:08:38.777 --> 00:08:41.859]  They tried to recruit him back in the 60s to work for them.
[00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:47.712]  A great author and lecturer and researcher joining us in the second hour, Pastor Butch Paw in the third.
[00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:50.874]  Let's plunge into the news.
[00:08:50.954 --> 00:09:03.601]  First off, I'm pleased that ABC News yesterday ran the headline and on the nightly news on Monday had a piece calling it the war on the Texas border.
[00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.502]  They called it a war.
[00:09:06.362 --> 00:09:07.203]  And when you've got
[00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:23.231]  Now, I haven't seen the numbers in two months, but in the first 10 months of 2005, in the first 10 months there were 800 plus dead Americans and Mexicans on the U.S.
[00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:31.132]  and Mexico side, right along the border in Luevo, Laredo, and of course on Laredo on the Texas side.
[00:09:31.152 --> 00:09:37.514]  It's twin cities there, really one city with a river running through the middle of it, much like London.
[00:09:40.028 --> 00:09:41.510]  Now why am I getting into topography?
[00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:51.483]  The point is, is that the State Department has issued now four warnings in the last year, since last year,
[00:09:52.443 --> 00:10:07.149]  Four warnings in the last 12 months or so saying don't go into those regions of South Texas and reporting that statistically it is more dangerous than areas of Israel like the West Bank.
[00:10:07.229 --> 00:10:17.514]  I mean 800 dead, 15 of them law enforcement, what you used to call peace officers, on the U.S.
[00:10:17.574 --> 00:10:17.994]  side
[00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:23.226]  Hundreds of US citizens kidnapped, held for ransom.
[00:10:24.087 --> 00:10:37.084]  I mean, imagine if, say, in New York City, or in Mobile, Alabama, or Pensacola, Florida, or somewhere else, 54 Americans were kidnapped at a pop.
[00:10:37.987 --> 00:10:49.991]  And taken to a garage and held at gunpoint by drug dealers, predominantly who were Los Zetas, Mexican government commandos.
[00:10:51.212 --> 00:10:54.873]  You would think that would be big news and you'd never hear the end of it.
[00:10:55.173 --> 00:10:56.953]  Well, we gotta have troops on the border.
[00:10:57.033 --> 00:11:00.195]  We gotta, you know, have tattletale squads everywhere.
[00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:02.075]  We gotta be searching cars everywhere.
[00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:03.716]  Military armed camp.
[00:11:03.776 --> 00:11:04.316]  It's a war.
[00:11:05.968 --> 00:11:13.172]  It was mentioned maybe on Lou Dobbs, ABC News, just small blurbs, and I mean that was just one event of hundreds.
[00:11:15.314 --> 00:11:23.318]  And again, car bombs in Dallas, car bombs in South Texas, cars being machine gunned, cars blowing up, murders right here in Austin.
[00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:34.405]  I talk a lot about this because it shows how if they want to shut something off in the media, if they want to ignore it, then your neighbor, I mean I talk to neighbors, they're smart people.
[00:11:35.136 --> 00:11:36.836]  They don't know anything about it!
[00:11:37.617 --> 00:11:40.619]  Cops don't know what one of the biggest threats to them is.
[00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:43.201]  You know, violent threats out there.
[00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:48.224]  The number one threat is their own driving and hanging out in the middle of the highway and pulling people over.
[00:11:48.264 --> 00:11:53.908]  But after all of those threats, then it's being shot or stabbed or beaten.
[00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:55.529]  I mean, cops know what the threats are to them.
[00:11:55.829 --> 00:12:07.377]  And the number one threat in Texas and now in Arizona and other areas is the illegal aliens, is the coyote smugglers, is the criminal gangs that have bounties out on your heads.
[00:12:10.318 --> 00:12:20.704]  And it's been officially in Texas and Arizona papers in the last few years that we've known about this for, I don't know, I first heard about it seven or eight years ago, directly from Border Patrol agents.
[00:12:21.304 --> 00:12:31.529]  My dad as a patient, my dad as a dentist, who's, let's just say about as high level Border Patrol as you can get, I think he's retired now, but he was in the Border Patrol then, let's just admit it, the head of the Border Patrol for Texas.
[00:12:32.737 --> 00:12:37.222]  And he said, oh yeah, there's bounties on our heads.
[00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:38.463]  They're $25,000 to $100,000.
[00:12:38.503 --> 00:12:41.346]  I think it's more than our people are worth.
[00:12:41.406 --> 00:12:44.330]  And he made a joke out of it, and of course that went right back to me.
[00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:50.651]  But, but, but, you know, this is the type of stuff that is going on.
[00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:59.775]  But no, the cop's gotta get all jittery when he pulls you over with his family and he's gotta put his hand on his gun and act all paranoid and, you know, freak out on you.
[00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:08.739]  Meanwhile, because he's been told to be afraid of the general public, he hasn't been told, she hasn't been told, to be afraid of the illegal alien invasion.
[00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:10.987]  And that's what it's called.
[00:13:11.007 --> 00:13:12.488]  That's what the radio stations call it.
[00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:15.310]  You know, The Invasion, The Invader, The Rebel.
[00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:21.093]  I drove through Mejia going to northeast Texas to visit family.
[00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:27.678]  I was driving down 84 through Mejia and my wife, you know, reads Spanish, she's like, that's called our land, you know.
[00:13:27.938 --> 00:13:29.879]  That's called, this is our land, you know.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.241]  Well, that little business is called The Rebel.
[00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:33.762]  That one's called The Revolutionary.
[00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:36.424]  And I mean, we're just driving through Mejia.
[00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:41.023]  Better known for the home of Anna Nicole Smith, and it's just everywhere.
[00:13:41.163 --> 00:13:42.985]  I mean, I've been driving there in my head for years.
[00:13:43.065 --> 00:13:44.747]  It's just suddenly there.
[00:13:45.228 --> 00:13:54.658]  You see, it's perfect for a revolution to breed with a group that doesn't speak the language of the general population, that has corporate support to keep it quiet,
[00:13:55.542 --> 00:13:57.645]  And then it's actually being funded by our own government.
[00:13:57.885 --> 00:14:01.669]  And then the Mexican government says, how dare you try to make anything illegal with illegal aliens?
[00:14:01.969 --> 00:14:03.751]  How dare you try to enforce anything?
[00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:07.095]  You better let more of our, quote, migrants in.
[00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:08.256]  They have a right.
[00:14:08.656 --> 00:14:16.825]  Our territory extends into Tejas and New Mexico and Nevada and Arizona and California.
[00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:32.490]  What, before France had it, and then Spain had it, and then Spain was about to sell it to Texas, about to sell it to the U.S., Andrew Jackson, and then you had a dictator take over, who later got overthrown by her own people.
[00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:37.993]  I mean, Mexico has no claim to Texas.
[00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:50.407]  The Mexicans that lived here, who helped write the Constitution, who fought in the war, are just as Texan or more Texan than white people or black people or polka-dotted people that live here.
[00:14:50.427 --> 00:14:53.309]  And if you're a Mexican and say you're a Texan, then you are a Texan.
[00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:56.631]  You're more a Texan than I am, if your family was here before my family.
[00:14:56.951 --> 00:15:01.715]  But there were only, what, about 6,000 Mexicans in Texas?
[00:15:01.755 --> 00:15:05.738]  Do you realize, folks, how no one was here because of the Comanche?
[00:15:06.418 --> 00:15:10.602]  And because of the other, the Creek Indians, and the rest of it?
[00:15:11.383 --> 00:15:24.354]  I mean, that's why Mexico actually, when it was Spain, came to the Tennesseans and other quite violent individuals, well known for being willing to fight, and said, will you please come in?
[00:15:24.414 --> 00:15:29.999]  Because Spain was about to just sell it to anybody that wanted it, because they couldn't get anything out of it.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.381]  So now,
[00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:53.260]  You've got populations who have no history here, never been here, they are the native mix with the Spanish Conquers, and they've been told by their rulers down in Mexico, and by our rulers here, that Texas and New Mexico and Arizona and California belong to them only because
[00:15:55.154 --> 00:16:03.597]  The establishment, the corporations, want to turn us all against each other, and don't want us to live in peace, and want to balkanize and break up this country.
[00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:09.580]  Now folks, that is just the facts.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.220]  It's that simple.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:19.023]  I mean, if you actually know history, France had Texas first.
[00:16:19.883 --> 00:16:23.825]  Spain had no dibs on it, and it went back and forth.
[00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:27.646]  And again, we were about to buy it from them.
[00:16:27.866 --> 00:16:31.771]  If anybody could say that they owned this property, it would be the Native Americans, the Aborigines.
[00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:34.054]  They really have a reason to be mad.
[00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:41.244]  And frankly, the Aborigines of Mexico have lost their identity and call themselves Mexicans.
[00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:56.334]  When in truth, all they are, are the once, and frankly still enslaved, indigenous populations by the Empire of Spain, and then Santa Ana, and then all the other emperors and viceroys and pimps that came along.
[00:16:56.394 --> 00:17:02.276]  I mean, Mexico itself was in the hands of France, Germany, Spain, everybody else.
[00:17:03.217 --> 00:17:11.660]  But again, the average American doesn't know history, the average Mexican doesn't know history, and so it's just unbelievable.
[00:17:13.391 --> 00:17:15.634]  It's unbelievable and I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:19.157]  So, I'm sorry, I'm now ranting on a history lesson here.
[00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:21.219]  They're stealing your heritage.
[00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:24.603]  I want Hispanics in Texas to know this, in Arizona, New Mexico, California.
[00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:30.089]  You're having your heritage stolen as Texans, as Californians, as Americans.
[00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.815]  And just because somebody in the past may have tried to tell you you didn't have heritage here, you do.
[00:17:36.607 --> 00:17:43.193]  Probably more than anybody else has claimed to, as natives, as having aboriginal blood, Native American blood.
[00:17:44.254 --> 00:17:47.436]  And then, let me tell you who has the land.
[00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:50.539]  It's who occupies it, and who builds it, and who works it.
[00:17:51.670 --> 00:18:04.697]  And so, uh, you know, now we're being told that, oh, just be friendly, oh, let the immigrant population in, we're just, we come in peace, and then meanwhile you turn over on the dial to the Spanish stations and it's a takeover that's commencing!
[00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:05.238]  Ha ha ha!
[00:18:05.438 --> 00:18:06.398]  Yes, we're going to get you!
[00:18:06.758 --> 00:18:09.180]  You know, the planet of San Diego, you'll all be exterminated!
[00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:13.202]  And of course, that is a minority of Hispanics.
[00:18:13.642 --> 00:18:15.863]  But that is what gets the major funding.
[00:18:16.224 --> 00:18:18.645]  That is what gets pushed by the corporations.
[00:18:20.077 --> 00:18:24.698]  And so I'm just sitting there trying to live in peace, and I'm hearing a certain group with major globalist funding.
[00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:26.639]  I mean, again, you know the globalists are bad, folks.
[00:18:26.659 --> 00:18:27.839]  You know George Bush is bad.
[00:18:28.199 --> 00:18:29.259]  Why is he for amnesty?
[00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:30.319]  Why is he for open borders?
[00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:31.640]  Why is Bill Clinton for it?
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.620]  Why is the U.N.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:33.960]  for it?
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.321]  Because the globalists want to bring America down.
[00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:38.681]  They want to break it up for corporate interest.
[00:18:38.981 --> 00:18:45.483]  You know, they're telling all these poor immigrants that they're going to get all this money and power once they've reconquered the Southwest.
[00:18:46.235 --> 00:18:48.636]  And I mean, if you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:18:48.857 --> 00:18:49.897]  You're going to get less.
[00:18:50.277 --> 00:18:54.300]  A little bit of opportunity you could have had in America is going to be gone.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.481]  We're all going to be on the colonies.
[00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:58.922]  We're all going to be on the plantation, brother.
[00:18:59.443 --> 00:19:02.685]  And I say, brother, I don't care what shade your skin is.
[00:19:04.246 --> 00:19:06.487]  Why do you think the feds fund the white supremacists?
[00:19:07.077 --> 00:19:09.259]  Just hundreds of cases we've documented, literally hundreds.
[00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:12.021]  Why do they fund the Loricon-Keystone Mexican supremacist?
[00:19:12.281 --> 00:19:13.842]  Why do they fund the black supremacist?
[00:19:14.103 --> 00:19:19.867]  Because they want us all at each other's throats, just like they played the natives off against each other.
[00:19:20.167 --> 00:19:25.712]  Whatever the dominant group is, the globalists are going to play them off against each other.
[00:19:26.092 --> 00:19:29.675]  Any empire, any encroaching group is going to do that.
[00:19:30.655 --> 00:19:32.236]  So, we are the people.
[00:19:32.316 --> 00:19:33.857]  We're the average Joe Schmo.
[00:19:33.877 --> 00:19:36.879]  Whether you're black or white, you're putting cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:38.220]  They're poisoning your water.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.661]  They're taking your private property.
[00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:41.342]  They're trying to force drug your kids.
[00:19:41.602 --> 00:19:43.403]  They're trying to give you a national ID card.
[00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:45.065]  No matter what color you are.
[00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:46.345]  So what do they do?
[00:19:46.365 --> 00:19:47.486]  What do the controllers do?
[00:19:47.646 --> 00:19:49.588]  They play us all off against each other.
[00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:55.091]  Because they couldn't stand five minutes against us if we got together and defeated the New World Order.
[00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:57.993]  Then if we all want to kill each other, then we can do that later.
[00:19:58.253 --> 00:19:58.994]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:59.014 --> 00:19:59.394]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.846 --> 00:20:04.867]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:05.207 --> 00:20:07.989]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:12.411]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.851 --> 00:20:13.672]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.992 --> 00:20:18.555]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:19.048 --> 00:20:21.169]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:22.549]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:20:22.949 --> 00:20:36.355]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:20:36.395 --> 00:20:43.517]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.172]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:05.692 --> 00:21:10.156]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[00:21:10.716 --> 00:21:16.961]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[00:21:17.661 --> 00:21:18.081]  We're good to go.
[00:21:34.172 --> 00:21:34.272]  516-8736.

[00:22:07.686 --> 00:22:08.907]  Currency devaluation.
[00:22:09.248 --> 00:22:09.808]  Inflation.
[00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.950]  One and the same.
[00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.675]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:21.949 --> 00:22:25.050]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.171]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:27.211 --> 00:22:30.252]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:30.792 --> 00:22:33.013]  Here is reality.
[00:22:33.373 --> 00:22:36.955]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.435 --> 00:22:41.116]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.677 --> 00:22:44.258]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:49.562]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:23:01.843 --> 00:23:03.324]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:03.664 --> 00:23:07.607]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:23:08.007 --> 00:23:11.510]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.452]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[00:23:15.853 --> 00:23:20.716]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:26.839]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:30.841]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:33.282]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:23:33.602 --> 00:23:39.385]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:23:39.805 --> 00:23:40.986]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:23:41.327 --> 00:23:42.428]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:23:42.508 --> 00:23:47.932]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[00:23:48.133 --> 00:23:51.616]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:53.197]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:23:53.217 --> 00:23:53.497]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.584]  Look, I'm not defending Saddam Hussein who was created by the globalists.
[00:24:13.644 --> 00:24:22.613]  I'm not defending what happened in Serbia with Tito or then after him Slobodan Milošević.
[00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:30.357]  But the reason the globalists didn't like them is they had their own industries, they were industrializing, they had their own universities, women were free.
[00:24:30.937 --> 00:24:33.939]  In both countries, women were graduating from college more than men.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.722]  More doctors, more lawyers, more scientists.
[00:24:36.982 --> 00:24:38.423]  That freaks the new world order out.
[00:24:39.224 --> 00:24:49.672]  And you could go to Iraq in the 80s, right up until the 1990s, and it was rock and roll music, English was the second language, Jews and Christians were totally left alone.
[00:24:50.701 --> 00:25:01.704]  And the globalist, and actually Brzezinski says this on the Grand Chess Board, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, National Security Advisor, he says, we don't want strong countries.
[00:25:01.844 --> 00:25:09.086]  If a country's good and independent, we're going to go in and kill their leaders and fund revolutions to actually put bad people in.
[00:25:09.646 --> 00:25:11.367]  If they're bad, then even better.
[00:25:12.034 --> 00:25:18.820]  You know, again, I'm not saying that these other countries are, quote, rogue, these 65 countries that the PNAC boys say they want to invade.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.521]  I'm not saying they're good or bad.
[00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:24.244]  They're good, bad, and ugly, as the old Spaghetti Western tells it.
[00:25:24.564 --> 00:25:29.028]  You know, the point is, whether they're good or bad, they're not under globalist control.
[00:25:29.668 --> 00:25:33.129]  And anything that is under globalist control is good for you and me.
[00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:39.731]  Because when the globalists get total world dominion, their open plan is one-child policies, forced abortions.
[00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:41.971]  China is the model, folks.
[00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:49.953]  And under Mao alone, they killed 60 million people, 30 million by starvation, 30 million at their own hands.
[00:25:50.013 --> 00:25:54.054]  I mean, you can go read that in this month's National Geographic and see what's admitted there.
[00:25:54.074 --> 00:25:57.855]  I mean, the Chinese government admits it, but then gives excuses for it.
[00:26:00.465 --> 00:26:22.476]  So for all the little gangbangers and all the people that are, you know, wanting to La Reconquista, I mean, just realize where your propaganda, where your theology, where your whole nomenclature, where your whole... it's not even theology, that's your whole legends, you know, just your whole false view, your whole liberation theology is the proper term.
[00:26:22.857 --> 00:26:25.598]  It's a corporate manufactured system.
[00:26:26.158 --> 00:26:27.459]  What does the UN do in Africa?
[00:26:28.357 --> 00:26:30.478]  There's no white people to get fighting with the blacks.
[00:26:30.778 --> 00:26:33.520]  They'll just play one black group off against the other black group.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.460]  And what's different about them?
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.380]  They're across the river.
[00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:37.041]  Or they're in the village to the north.
[00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:37.962]  And the U.N.
[00:26:38.002 --> 00:26:40.043]  will come in and finance one group to kill the others.
[00:26:40.063 --> 00:26:41.823]  And then they'll finance another group to kill that group.
[00:26:42.324 --> 00:26:43.984]  It's just tribal politics.
[00:26:44.365 --> 00:26:46.566]  What does the Israeli plan say they wanted for Iraq in 83?
[00:26:46.826 --> 00:26:48.287]  To have the U.S.
[00:26:48.327 --> 00:26:51.028]  go in, break it up into three or four regions.
[00:26:51.648 --> 00:27:01.091]  And I had two big CIA analysts and covert operators, one of them a commander, a CIA commander on last week, running whole operations, saying, yeah, that's really what's happening, yes.
[00:27:01.532 --> 00:27:02.812]  Yeah, that's the plan.
[00:27:03.492 --> 00:27:04.953]  I mean, that's what they state!
[00:27:05.013 --> 00:27:16.777]  I mean, it's not like it's... See, on the national news, they just want to have happiness and love, and the women having freedom in Iraq, and in truth, the burkas are going back on them.
[00:27:17.413 --> 00:27:22.619]  In truth, there's even more of that stuff now going on in Afghanistan.
[00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:25.502]  It was all manufactured bull.
[00:27:26.283 --> 00:27:27.624]  They want them balkanized.
[00:27:27.664 --> 00:27:28.745]  They don't want them strong.
[00:27:28.765 --> 00:27:29.846]  They don't want them independent.
[00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:32.109]  And it's that simple.
[00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:38.736]  I mean, now there's a seven-time-fold what there was before 9-11 of opium flooding out of Afghanistan.
[00:27:40.468 --> 00:27:43.469]  Then the globalists openly have said they want the opposite in Iraq.
[00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:43.909]  They don't!
[00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:49.752]  You know, neocons go on the radio and go, well, there's record lows of oil the last 50 years flowing out of Iraq.
[00:27:51.633 --> 00:27:56.274]  All these liberal liars say that we wanted oil.
[00:27:56.314 --> 00:27:57.715]  Well, if we wanted oil, it'd be flowing!
[00:27:59.076 --> 00:28:00.096]  No, that's not right.
[00:28:00.939 --> 00:28:03.880]  Do you make more of something if it's scarce or if it's plentiful?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.540]  What did they get mad at Saddam for in the late eighties?
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.760]  Stop over pumping!
[00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:10.741]  You're driving down the price!
[00:28:11.261 --> 00:28:12.361]  Knock it off!
[00:28:13.181 --> 00:28:17.002]  And he's like, no, I got thirty billion dollar debt to pay back to the US.
[00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.442]  I got other debts to pay.
[00:28:18.462 --> 00:28:19.402]  I'm going to pay my debts.
[00:28:19.842 --> 00:28:21.523]  He wanted to be sovereign and independent.
[00:28:22.123 --> 00:28:24.523]  And they said, buddy, we put you in.
[00:28:24.603 --> 00:28:26.324]  You do what we say.
[00:28:27.004 --> 00:28:28.364]  And so it all started.
[00:28:29.528 --> 00:28:31.071]  They tricked him into attacking Kuwait.
[00:28:31.391 --> 00:28:35.798]  And again, I'm not defending or debating Saddam Hussein.
[00:28:35.938 --> 00:28:41.026]  It even shows how evil the globalists are that they actually put him in, but it didn't go the way they wanted to.
[00:28:41.906 --> 00:28:42.986]  It's just like with Kennedy.
[00:28:43.006 --> 00:28:45.127]  He was their man and he didn't do what they wanted to.
[00:28:45.607 --> 00:28:52.188]  So whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, or ugly, or whatever, warts and all, they took him out.
[00:28:52.468 --> 00:28:55.248]  Because he didn't play patty cake with them.
[00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:57.029]  He didn't scratch their back.
[00:28:57.089 --> 00:29:00.329]  He didn't, when they said jump, ask, yes master, how high?
[00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:08.671]  And so we get this report here, MS-13 gang hired to murder Border Patrol, Daily Bulletin, Mexican alien smugglers planned to pay
[00:29:10.143 --> 00:29:16.579]  Violent gang members have smuggled them into the United States to murder Border Patrol agents and they just run right back across and the Sente Fox is behind this.
[00:29:16.619 --> 00:29:19.647]  According to confidential Department of Homeland Security memo obtained on the Daily Bulletin.
[00:29:20.914 --> 00:29:37.440]  The Officer Safety Alert, dated December 21st, this is like the fifth one I've seen, warns agents that the smugglers intend to bring members of the International Mara, I don't even know how to pronounce it, Street Gang, also known as MS-13, to the country for a deadly mission.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:44.682]  Unidentified Mexican alien smugglers are angry about the increased security along the Mexico border and are agreed that the best way to deal with the U.S.
[00:29:44.722 --> 00:29:47.083]  Border Patrol agents is to hire a group of contract killers.
[00:29:48.024 --> 00:29:48.764]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:55.414]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.355 --> 00:29:59.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.222 --> 00:30:10.848]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[00:30:11.228 --> 00:30:15.971]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[00:30:16.311 --> 00:30:20.254]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[00:30:20.594 --> 00:30:25.637]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:29.840]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.741]  We're good to go!
[00:30:55.237 --> 00:30:59.258]  Call 1-800-845-3841 to learn more.
[00:30:59.438 --> 00:31:00.238]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:04.159]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:08.381]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:11.401]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:11.461 --> 00:31:18.123]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:18.363 --> 00:31:18.704]  Yes, sir.
[00:31:34.447 --> 00:31:35.187]  M-T-B-E.
[00:31:35.408 --> 00:31:35.868]  Radon 222.
[00:31:36.328 --> 00:31:38.309]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:31:38.449 --> 00:31:43.571]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:43.711 --> 00:31:51.494]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:03.473 --> 00:32:06.055]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:06.195 --> 00:32:08.357]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:08.637 --> 00:32:18.746]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:32:19.066 --> 00:32:21.288]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.811]  Alright, I'm going to try to
[00:33:13.584 --> 00:33:19.389]  Get off the subject of the Los Zetas, Special Forces, killing cops.
[00:33:19.469 --> 00:33:20.830]  It isn't they're going to kill them.
[00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:26.395]  They've already killed 15 in the first 10 months of last year, and I haven't looked up the numbers since then.
[00:33:26.415 --> 00:33:28.557]  I mean, 15 U.S.
[00:33:28.637 --> 00:33:29.057]  cops.
[00:33:29.578 --> 00:33:31.359]  Feds, locals, sheriffs, deputies.
[00:33:31.379 --> 00:33:32.260]  I mean, they're killing you.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:33.921]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:33:33.961 --> 00:33:40.567]  You're too busy, you know, trying to get my guns or out writing tickets for no reason with your radar guns.
[00:33:41.434 --> 00:33:43.177]  It's just mindlessness.
[00:33:43.718 --> 00:33:50.150]  Where, you know, the Viper teams are in Houston and Dallas and searching people randomly on the street looking for Al Cieda.
[00:33:51.383 --> 00:33:52.643]  So I'm done talking about that.
[00:33:53.243 --> 00:33:54.604]  I might get a little bit more into it later.
[00:33:54.624 --> 00:33:58.645]  I want to get into Bush playing war with Iraq long before 9-11 attacks.
[00:33:58.725 --> 00:33:59.685]  More info on that.
[00:34:00.005 --> 00:34:01.865]  Cost of Iraq war could top $2 trillion.
[00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:03.846]  Iraq races for civil war.
[00:34:03.906 --> 00:34:07.926]  Senator Frank Church says the NSA could enable a dictator to impose total tyranny.
[00:34:07.946 --> 00:34:10.607]  Of course, that was way back in the 70s that he said that.
[00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:12.567]  An amazing senator and his committee.
[00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:13.588]  He did so much good work.
[00:34:14.048 --> 00:34:17.388]  National Security Agency mounted massive spy op on Baltimore Peace Group.
[00:34:17.749 --> 00:34:19.569]  Documents show that's coming out right now.
[00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:27.896]  And the new Supreme Court nominee, Alito, saying no president's above the law, but his internal memos say the president is a dictator.
[00:34:27.916 --> 00:34:29.697]  That's why he's being pushed.
[00:34:30.398 --> 00:34:32.139]  And so we'll get into that.
[00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.562]  Also was the New York Times, David Rosenbaum assassinated.
[00:34:36.252 --> 00:34:39.075]  And a lot of evidence is showing that he may have been.
[00:34:39.416 --> 00:34:44.441]  He's been writing bad stories about Alito and Bush wanting to be a dictator and he just retired.
[00:34:45.322 --> 00:34:51.449]  Even the New York police are starting to say this looks like it might have been a hit because of the way he was just beaten to death.
[00:34:51.529 --> 00:34:56.174]  It just doesn't fit the normal MO of another type of operation.
[00:34:57.083 --> 00:34:58.944]  Well, he could have just been mugged and killed in New York.
[00:34:59.384 --> 00:35:01.265]  That's certainly nothing new there.
[00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:05.206]  The world will probably never know, but it is interesting.
[00:35:05.226 --> 00:35:07.167]  If hundreds of reporters in the U.S.
[00:35:07.187 --> 00:35:20.693]  start dying like this, like microbiologists have, then we'll statistically be able to do the math, and if it's 1 out of 14 billion, like it was when it got to 85 dead microbiologists from murder, then you know something's going on.
[00:35:22.777 --> 00:35:27.338]  So I want to go through all of that and maybe jam a few calls in before this hour ends and get Dr. Dennis Cutting on.
[00:35:27.378 --> 00:35:37.521]  We'll also take calls when the doctor is on with us to talk about the New World Order's latest criminal activities as we chronicle their activities in the next hour.
[00:35:37.581 --> 00:35:42.422]  But before we go back into the news, she hasn't been on with us in about two or three weeks.
[00:35:42.782 --> 00:35:44.382]  We like to have her up every few weeks at least.
[00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.603]  Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[00:35:46.623 --> 00:35:49.724]  Before I go to Debbie, again, I'm not going to belabor this.
[00:35:49.824 --> 00:35:50.524]  It's real simple.
[00:35:51.937 --> 00:35:53.357]  I don't pitch magic creams.
[00:35:53.537 --> 00:35:56.158]  I don't pitch magic machines that heal you.
[00:35:56.818 --> 00:36:00.219]  I don't pitch 100% cancer cures.
[00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:02.319]  I don't do all that, folks.
[00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:05.920]  If you hear me endorsing something, it's because I really believe in it.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.981]  Like if it's Calbin Pure Soap, made in America, you save about 85% off.
[00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:12.041]  It doesn't eat holes through your clothes.
[00:36:12.081 --> 00:36:12.781]  It's not toxic.
[00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:17.422]  It's made out of plants and vegetables and things like that.
[00:36:18.294 --> 00:36:18.655]  That's great.
[00:36:34.076 --> 00:36:40.961]  And you know, I'm proud of that fact, because I can make boo-koos of money, and I don't blame other people that want to, you know, claim that other stuff does things.
[00:36:41.081 --> 00:36:41.561]  I don't know.
[00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:48.566]  The point is, I don't know, and it just, so I'm not going to be out here, you know, looking like somebody riding into town with my snake oil.
[00:36:49.469 --> 00:36:52.069]  You need to get British Birkfeld filters.
[00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:52.690]  They have those.
[00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.330]  You need to get the American Big Berkey.
[00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.270]  I've seen the university studies.
[00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:57.651]  It's even better.
[00:36:57.771 --> 00:36:58.451]  A new standard.
[00:36:58.511 --> 00:36:59.211]  Non-detectable.
[00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:01.511]  Electron microscopes find nothing, okay?
[00:37:01.551 --> 00:37:04.092]  I mean, this is just a new standard in gravity fed.
[00:37:05.532 --> 00:37:08.532]  And you even save money getting the Made in America ones.
[00:37:08.552 --> 00:37:11.213]  $1.99 for the equivalent and a British Berkey would be about $2.35.
[00:37:11.573 --> 00:37:13.653]  But if you want stainless steel, you want Lexan, they got it.
[00:37:13.673 --> 00:37:16.714]  You want Black Berkey, the black elements are even better than the white elephants.
[00:37:17.486 --> 00:37:18.146]  White elephants, yes.
[00:37:18.446 --> 00:37:19.467]  White elements.
[00:37:20.407 --> 00:37:21.087]  Then they've got it.
[00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:32.571]  And, you know, they have the Indian knock-offs that are just total pieces of junk that cost $300 when I've seen them at the camping store.
[00:37:33.111 --> 00:37:34.672]  The water is full of poison.
[00:37:34.692 --> 00:37:37.052]  The allowable amounts, it is an absolute joke.
[00:37:37.693 --> 00:37:39.233]  I mean, it is just ridiculous.
[00:37:39.253 --> 00:37:43.315]  And if you're using well water, even from a deep well, there could be parasites in it.
[00:37:43.535 --> 00:37:44.595]  This will knock that out.
[00:37:45.268 --> 00:37:47.191]  You need to get this.
[00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:48.172]  You need to call.
[00:37:48.192 --> 00:37:51.177]  You can go to InfoWars.com, and we've got all the specials up there.
[00:37:51.197 --> 00:37:58.648]  You can order off our secure shopping cart, and we, every day, then fax the orders over to them in Dallas, where they ship them out to you from UPS Ground.
[00:37:59.962 --> 00:38:05.586]  Or you can call Debbie directly right now, or you can go to Berkeywater.com and order off their secure online shopping cart.
[00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:06.707]  Three ways to do it.
[00:38:06.787 --> 00:38:09.889]  My shopping cart, their shopping cart, or give them a ring-a-dingy.
[00:38:10.129 --> 00:38:11.170]  Or I guess you can write to them.
[00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:17.434]  Debbie, it's great to have you back here in the new year on this 11th day.
[00:38:17.674 --> 00:38:19.795]  How was your Christmas holiday?
[00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:21.616]  Oh, it was wonderful, thank you.
[00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:22.397]  Kind of quiet.
[00:38:23.077 --> 00:38:24.638]  We do quiet Christmas, though.
[00:38:25.099 --> 00:38:25.579]  It was nice.
[00:38:26.149 --> 00:38:27.490]  Very nice.
[00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:28.410]  Well, that's great.
[00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.591]  You've got new specials.
[00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:40.418]  You know, we forget that we breathe massive toxins in the shower or in a hot bath, and so you've got KDF shower filters that don't do what the big Berkey do.
[00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:46.221]  They don't cut everything out, but they reduce it massively, and it's so important if you have children.
[00:38:46.261 --> 00:38:47.742]  I mean, I personally use these.
[00:38:48.803 --> 00:38:49.903]  Tell folks about that special.
[00:38:50.284 --> 00:38:55.727]  Yes, we're offering with the Berkey light with the lights, we're offering a free KDF shower filter.
[00:38:56.499 --> 00:38:57.120]  Thank you for
[00:39:17.908 --> 00:39:25.311]  They start out at $235 for the Big Berkey, $260 for the Royal Berkey, which is kind of my favorite size.
[00:39:25.371 --> 00:39:25.772]  What does it do?
[00:39:25.792 --> 00:39:26.892]  Three gallons or something?
[00:39:26.992 --> 00:39:27.352]  It does.
[00:39:27.412 --> 00:39:32.635]  It holds three and a quarter gallons, and I think it's just a really perfect size for a normal family.
[00:39:32.655 --> 00:39:33.875]  And what does it do with its filters?
[00:39:33.915 --> 00:39:36.996]  Like 15,000 gallons in filter life or something?
[00:39:37.076 --> 00:39:37.357]  Yes.
[00:39:37.657 --> 00:39:40.438]  Well, it comes with two black Berkey purification elements.
[00:39:41.004 --> 00:39:46.267]  Which is 6,000 gallons of chemical removal.
[00:39:46.587 --> 00:39:48.529]  I just thought that because it has four holes.
[00:39:48.869 --> 00:39:50.750]  Right, you can expand it up to four.
[00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:51.570]  Oh, okay.
[00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.452]  Yeah, and then we have... So it'd be 12,000.
[00:39:53.512 --> 00:39:54.672]  What filter am I thinking of that does 15?
[00:39:55.533 --> 00:39:56.734]  Or is that the white elements?
[00:39:57.414 --> 00:40:02.317]  Well, that's the Imperial Berkey that does 15 gallons an hour if you have six filters in it.
[00:40:03.337 --> 00:40:05.478]  And that's one that holds four and a half gallons.
[00:40:05.518 --> 00:40:06.739]  I get all this stuff confused.
[00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:09.380]  But I mean, I think the best deal is the Berkey Light.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.060]  Made in America.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:10.760]  Black elements.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.501]  A new standard.
[00:40:11.841 --> 00:40:13.842]  Non-detectable under electron microscope.
[00:40:14.202 --> 00:40:14.962]  A new standard.
[00:40:15.522 --> 00:40:17.703]  And you get that for $1.99 and a free sport.
[00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:24.506]  It's a little sports bottle that cleans out almost all the toxins and poison.
[00:40:24.546 --> 00:40:36.212]  It's not non-detectable like the other, but you can do 130 refills of swamp water, 600 and something refills of tap water, and that's what we personally use when I go to the gym or I'm going out or I go on a trip.
[00:40:36.452 --> 00:40:37.873]  I do not drink tap water, folks.
[00:40:38.173 --> 00:40:38.793]  That's not true.
[00:40:38.813 --> 00:40:40.674]  Sometimes I drink iced tea and I really shouldn't do it.
[00:40:41.986 --> 00:40:51.409]  Well, and you know, especially for the people who are in the drought areas, they'll notice that the water coming out of tapas is terrible, because all the lakes and rivers are so low.
[00:40:51.509 --> 00:40:57.391]  Right here in Austin, the aquifer is so low that I was washing my hands and like the water was yellow coming out.
[00:40:57.511 --> 00:40:59.011]  Yeah, it's really terrible.
[00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:00.291]  It's terrible, I know.
[00:41:00.451 --> 00:41:05.753]  But you know, whenever I'm giving my children a bath, the water's not yellow, because guess what I have on it?
[00:41:06.792 --> 00:41:08.054]  You have a Cadian shower filter.
[00:41:08.074 --> 00:41:10.256]  That's right, we just hang the shower nozzle down.
[00:41:10.296 --> 00:41:11.998]  You know, we have one of those tube ones.
[00:41:12.018 --> 00:41:13.500]  Yeah, that's what we do too.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.942]  Tell folks about the discount on those.
[00:41:15.582 --> 00:41:19.787]  Okay, well they're normally $49, but we have them on sale for $35.
[00:41:20.308 --> 00:41:22.991]  Or they can get the free one with the Berkey light with the lights.
[00:41:24.498 --> 00:41:25.719]  Alright, let me give folks the number.
[00:41:25.799 --> 00:41:29.260]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:29.641 --> 00:41:30.321]  Triple 8.
[00:41:30.361 --> 00:41:31.161]  803-4438.
[00:41:31.802 --> 00:41:33.783]  That's triple 8.
[00:41:33.823 --> 00:41:35.203]  803-4438.
[00:41:35.844 --> 00:41:37.444]  Stop procrastinating.
[00:41:37.544 --> 00:41:38.905]  None of us can take care of it all.
[00:41:38.965 --> 00:41:41.967]  None of us can stop eating all the GMO food.
[00:41:41.987 --> 00:41:43.507]  It's almost impossible.
[00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:45.948]  None of us can stop breathing the toxins in the air.
[00:41:45.968 --> 00:41:50.010]  None of us can stop doing everything or stop always putting a cell phone up to our head.
[00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:51.091]  It is admittedly deadly.
[00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:55.233]  But you can get these filters and stop drinking the poison.
[00:41:55.253 --> 00:41:56.353]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:41:56.533 --> 00:42:02.556]  Or go to BerkeyWater.com or go to InfoWars.com and order off our shopping cart.
[00:42:02.896 --> 00:42:05.577]  Or there's a banner on the left-hand side to BerkeyWater.com.
[00:42:06.058 --> 00:42:07.198]  Just give Debbie a call.
[00:42:07.218 --> 00:42:08.679]  If the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.041]  She'll call you right back.
[00:42:11.081 --> 00:42:12.262]  Debbie, thank you so much.
[00:42:12.502 --> 00:42:13.303]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:42:13.543 --> 00:42:14.804]  I'll talk to you soon.
[00:42:14.864 --> 00:42:15.124]  You bet.
[00:42:15.144 --> 00:42:15.965]  We'll talk to you soon.
[00:42:16.825 --> 00:42:18.907]  Listen, I believe in it, and you're crazy if you don't do it.
[00:42:18.927 --> 00:42:19.908]  888-803-4438.
[00:42:19.928 --> 00:42:23.310]  Thanks for sitting there for five minutes while we talked about that.
[00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.751]  Okay.
[00:42:25.492 --> 00:42:34.979]  Again, I mean, my wife does use a hands-free with a cell phone, and she's got that Blackberry or Blueberry or whatever the newest thing's called.
[00:42:36.257 --> 00:42:40.740]  I've got an old phone because I won't take the new ones that track me down to the exact place I'm at.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.922]  Plus, my old phone works literally five times better than other people's.
[00:42:43.942 --> 00:42:45.843]  I mean, it works where other people's don't work.
[00:42:45.883 --> 00:42:47.364]  It never cuts out to speak of.
[00:42:47.704 --> 00:42:48.425]  It's just wonderful.
[00:42:50.326 --> 00:42:51.927]  And no, I'm not about to pitch cell phones.
[00:42:51.947 --> 00:42:53.948]  I'm just talking about another pet peeve of mine.
[00:42:54.929 --> 00:42:55.489]  I'm an idiot!
[00:42:57.072 --> 00:42:58.714]  I buy the little wires.
[00:42:58.794 --> 00:43:02.997]  I always lose them or they get stuck in the door or they break with a little wire.
[00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:04.198]  I've read the studies.
[00:43:04.258 --> 00:43:11.124]  It still sends some of the microwave energy down the wire directly into your skull, but it's very low compared to holding it up against your head.
[00:43:11.144 --> 00:43:12.565]  But don't stick it between your legs either.
[00:43:13.726 --> 00:43:17.089]  You'll be like the cops who get testicular cancer or ovarian cancer from that.
[00:43:19.331 --> 00:43:25.076]  I don't know why I lost my wire about two months ago and haven't gone and bought another.
[00:43:27.552 --> 00:43:34.416]  You know, I lose sunglasses, I lose those little wires, I lose stuff a lot because I'm always so busy or doing stuff or break stuff on accident.
[00:43:35.217 --> 00:43:35.997]  Sometimes on purpose.
[00:43:36.517 --> 00:43:36.958]  I'm getting mad.
[00:43:36.998 --> 00:43:40.780]  But seriously, why are we all still sticking cell phones to our heads?
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.981]  Why is my dad doing it?
[00:43:42.241 --> 00:43:43.822]  Why is my wife doing it sometimes?
[00:43:44.162 --> 00:43:45.003]  Why am I doing it?
[00:43:45.083 --> 00:43:46.463]  Why are my employees doing it?
[00:43:46.904 --> 00:43:48.044]  Why do I see you doing it?
[00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:50.026]  Why do I see five-year-olds with cell phones now?
[00:43:50.086 --> 00:43:53.628]  Or that's not true, eight-year-olds with cell phones, ten-year-olds with cell phones at the mall.
[00:43:54.428 --> 00:43:55.909]  Why can't we stop it?
[00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:00.653]  Why can't we stop drinking the aspartame diet cokes?
[00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:03.935]  I mean, I don't drink them, but the point is, it's in 9,000 foods now.
[00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.476]  Why don't we read the labels?
[00:44:05.596 --> 00:44:15.483]  Why don't we eat GMO food, which admittedly is causing six times the fetal death in mammals, in studies they've done.
[00:44:16.003 --> 00:44:22.888]  Why do we sleep while our beds are burning, as some rock and roll song says?
[00:44:24.876 --> 00:44:26.217]  I mean, why is this happening?
[00:44:26.398 --> 00:44:26.798]  Why?
[00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:29.360]  Because we're born into it.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.381]  It's incremental.
[00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:32.303]  We get habits doing it.
[00:44:33.564 --> 00:44:34.665]  Why do we smoke cigarettes?
[00:44:34.725 --> 00:44:35.586]  I don't smoke anymore.
[00:44:35.626 --> 00:44:36.406]  I've smoked on and off.
[00:44:36.627 --> 00:44:37.928]  Well, we know it gives us lung cancer.
[00:44:39.449 --> 00:44:42.792]  Still, at least a cell phone isn't addictive.
[00:44:43.192 --> 00:44:44.834]  The radiation to the head isn't addictive.
[00:44:44.874 --> 00:44:46.575]  At least I don't think it is, but maybe it is.
[00:44:47.596 --> 00:44:48.677]  Aspartame is addictive.
[00:44:48.697 --> 00:44:50.639]  We know a lot of people know it's deadly, but keep drinking it.
[00:44:51.172 --> 00:44:51.992]  It's wood alcohol.
[00:44:52.473 --> 00:44:53.653]  Poisons are addictive, folks.
[00:44:53.753 --> 00:44:56.234]  A lot of the old poisons were just toxins.
[00:44:56.974 --> 00:44:58.495]  War heavy metals, things of that nature.
[00:44:59.976 --> 00:45:00.316]  Why?
[00:45:00.476 --> 00:45:00.796]  Why?
[00:45:01.196 --> 00:45:02.356]  Why can't we stop it?
[00:45:04.017 --> 00:45:07.018]  To my own self, why can't we stop it?
[00:45:08.799 --> 00:45:10.560]  That's a question we've got to ask ourselves.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.460]  Why are you on a cell phone right now?
[00:45:13.821 --> 00:45:15.182]  Why do I do it?
[00:45:15.242 --> 00:45:16.242]  Why am I an idiot?
[00:45:17.968 --> 00:45:19.548]  I just... Alex Jones?
[00:45:19.668 --> 00:45:20.209]  Stop it!
[00:45:20.669 --> 00:45:26.770]  Go to the store today and buy yourself another wire and stop sticking the phone up to your head.
[00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.790]  Well, it just sounds better when I don't and it's easier.
[00:45:30.151 --> 00:45:33.651]  Yeah, when you get that big fat brain tumor, Alex, it's going to be easier.
[00:45:35.412 --> 00:45:39.772]  We've got to get conscious and just... You're not going to stop doing everything overnight.
[00:45:39.792 --> 00:45:42.773]  You know, with bad habits we tend to think we just got to quit it all overnight.
[00:45:42.813 --> 00:45:43.013]  No.
[00:45:44.133 --> 00:45:47.354]  I have started eating mainly organic food.
[00:45:48.434 --> 00:45:52.357]  I have totally stopped eating fast food in the last few years.
[00:45:53.018 --> 00:45:54.779]  I have cut way back on the amount of meat I eat.
[00:45:54.839 --> 00:45:58.162]  Not because meat's bad, but because it's so dangerous now, the stuff that's in it.
[00:45:59.743 --> 00:46:03.266]  You know, a lot of these cows are eating alpha toxin grains, and that just gets passed right on to you.
[00:46:03.446 --> 00:46:04.988]  You know, alpha toxin gets in dog foods.
[00:46:05.008 --> 00:46:07.690]  Look at the big dog food recall right now, and all these dead dogs.
[00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:12.854]  I mean, the point is that there's a lot of bad stuff going on, and we've got to start getting aware of it.
[00:46:12.874 --> 00:46:13.915]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:46:16.344 --> 00:46:18.909]  It's just another one of my pet peeves, because I mean, I do it.
[00:46:19.089 --> 00:46:20.431]  Again, I'm not preaching.
[00:46:20.471 --> 00:46:20.712]  It's you.
[00:46:20.752 --> 00:46:21.473]  I'm a moron.
[00:46:21.994 --> 00:46:22.775]  Just like you are.
[00:46:23.817 --> 00:46:27.503]  Bush planned war with Iraq long before 9-1-1 attacks.
[00:46:30.009 --> 00:46:33.031]  This is Capitol Hill Blue, and again, most of this has already been out in the news.
[00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:48.799]  President George W. Bush began planning a war with Iraq before he took office on January 20, 2001, and long before the 9-11 terrorist attacks, gave him the excuse he needed to push American intelligence agencies to fabricate evidence of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, and plotted with Osama bin Laden to attack America.
[00:46:49.259 --> 00:46:51.720]  Bush knew from the get-go that he wanted to invade Iraq.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:57.003]  It was on his mind before the election, and campaign aides say he was obsessed with getting Saddam.
[00:46:57.563 --> 00:47:08.987]  We'd be on the campaign plane talking about domestic issues and he'd change the subject and start rattling on about what a great evil Saddam Hussein was and how if we won the election he'd finish what his father failed to do.
[00:47:09.007 --> 00:47:16.350]  Topple Hussein, says campaign worker Jerry Caulfield, who worked for the administration one year before leaving.
[00:47:17.123 --> 00:47:23.066]  Others tell similar stories that terrorist attacks weren't the reason Bush invaded Iraq, they provided the excuse.
[00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:31.691]  We will confront weapons of mass destruction so that a new century is spared new horrors, Bush said in his inaugural address January 20th, 2001.
[00:47:31.951 --> 00:47:42.997]  On January 21st, Bush held his first meeting of the National Security Council, and in that White House, at the meeting, he ordered the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to draw up plans for invasions of Iraq, as he said, a contingency.
[00:47:43.437 --> 00:47:55.603]  On February 16th, in a press conference with Mexican President Vicente Fox, Bush said, Saddam Hussein has got to understand that we expect him to confront, we expect to confront him on the agreement that he signed with Desert Storm.
[00:47:55.643 --> 00:47:58.185]  We will enforce a no-fly zone both north and south.
[00:47:58.745 --> 00:48:04.128]  Our investigation is to make sure that the world is peaceful as possible, and we're going to watch every
[00:48:04.919 --> 00:48:10.906]  Very carefully, as to whether or not he develops weapons of mass destruction, and if we catch him doing so, we will take the appropriate action.
[00:48:11.286 --> 00:48:15.851]  February 23rd, in a press conference with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair said, and it goes on and on.
[00:48:16.172 --> 00:48:16.913]  Folks, forget that!
[00:48:16.973 --> 00:48:21.738]  We have his own biographer in a book authorized by Bush!
[00:48:21.918 --> 00:48:23.520]  I mean, this is something Bush has put out!
[00:48:25.018 --> 00:48:26.960]  Saying, I'm going to be a war president in 1999.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:40.911]  Right as he's secretly getting ready to form his exploratory committee when he was right here in Austin, Texas with his, with his, with his autobiographer saying, when I'm a war president, quote, I can't be questioned domestically.
[00:48:41.712 --> 00:48:45.115]  And folks, I can't read most of these quotes.
[00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:48.738]  Forget the freaking Afghanistan Bush responded, Hussein is behind this.
[00:48:49.218 --> 00:48:49.679]  I know it.
[00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:51.160]  We're going to, into Iraq.
[00:48:52.603 --> 00:48:55.085]  And he goes on and on with published statements out of newspapers.
[00:48:55.386 --> 00:49:00.390]  But the neocons, Bush still gets up and goes, I never planned to invade Iraq, it's all lies!
[00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:04.234]  When he gave press conferences saying it, and told his autobiographer this!
[00:49:04.454 --> 00:49:06.256]  See, this is what's frustrating about all of this.
[00:49:07.677 --> 00:49:13.562]  They admit all of this on the surface, and then
[00:49:15.749 --> 00:49:17.790]  Then get up and tell us they never said it.
[00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:22.493]  It's like Rumsfeld saying on Face the Nation, I never said there were WMDs, it's an urban legend.
[00:49:22.773 --> 00:49:24.374]  And so they start running all the quotes.
[00:49:24.454 --> 00:49:29.257]  I mean, it's just... They don't intellectually battle this honestly.
[00:49:30.578 --> 00:49:36.721]  And, you know, now it's coming out the cost of the Iraq war could top two trillion, a major study shows, Reuters reports.
[00:49:37.161 --> 00:49:41.424]  The cost of the Iraq war could top two trillion, far above the White House pre-war projections.
[00:49:42.699 --> 00:49:45.962]  When long-term costs such as lifetime health care for thousands of wounded U.S.
[00:49:46.002 --> 00:49:48.023]  soldiers are included, a study said on Monday.
[00:49:49.204 --> 00:49:50.485]  Two trillion, folks.
[00:49:51.826 --> 00:49:56.589]  We now have a $3.8 trillion budget, but it's quite large.
[00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:05.056]  Columbia University economist Joseph E. Stiglitz said Harvard lecturer Linda Bilmes included in their study
[00:50:06.698 --> 00:50:09.200]  Disability payments for the 16,000 wounded U.S.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.543]  soldiers, and it's going to get even higher, about 20% of them suffer serious brain or spinal injuries.
[00:50:14.004 --> 00:50:14.504]  They said U.S.
[00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:17.687]  taxpayers will be burdened with costs that linger long after U.S.
[00:50:17.727 --> 00:50:18.407]  troop withdrawals.
[00:50:18.547 --> 00:50:19.528]  Oh, no, they won't.
[00:50:19.768 --> 00:50:21.029]  They're not going to get care.
[00:50:21.329 --> 00:50:22.090]  They never do.
[00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:25.072]  They're going to get the maggot treatment.
[00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:27.474]  You don't know about the maggoting and ratting.
[00:50:27.514 --> 00:50:28.415]  That's what it's known as.
[00:50:28.815 --> 00:50:31.357]  They'll chain you down and let the maggots have your way with you.
[00:50:31.377 --> 00:50:32.058]  Oh, you don't believe it?
[00:50:32.078 --> 00:50:32.778]  Just type it into Google.
[00:50:32.798 --> 00:50:34.700]  You'll get Kansas City Star.
[00:50:35.521 --> 00:50:41.302]  You'll get Sacramento Bee and the maggoting deaths from California to Missouri.
[00:50:41.322 --> 00:50:43.103]  Oh, you don't want to hear about it?
[00:50:43.123 --> 00:50:50.345]  Oh, it's not patriotic to talk about the troops dying with maggots entering the nasal cavity and laying eggs and eating the brain.
[00:50:50.925 --> 00:50:51.225]  I know.
[00:50:51.585 --> 00:50:58.107]  Supporting the troops means slapping a sticker on the car, sucking up the DU, and just loving George Bush as you hand your guns in.
[00:50:58.287 --> 00:50:58.907]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:06.746]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.947 --> 00:51:11.392]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:11.532 --> 00:51:15.897]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.937 --> 00:51:17.298]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.911]  Panama!
[00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:23.273]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:23.353 --> 00:51:30.277]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:30.398 --> 00:51:32.459]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:43.105]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:43.405 --> 00:51:45.547]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:51:45.947 --> 00:51:47.187]  This is my new two and a half hour video.
[00:51:47.207 --> 00:51:48.788]  Police Day 3 is for you!

[00:52:02.279 --> 00:52:07.504]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:07.644 --> 00:52:15.753]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.993 --> 00:52:23.060]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:24.001 --> 00:52:30.485]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:30.685 --> 00:52:35.769]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:35.889 --> 00:52:44.755]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:45.015 --> 00:52:48.318]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:53:51.412 --> 00:53:57.358]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:53:57.378 --> 00:54:06.347]  We don't need no education
[00:54:16.238 --> 00:54:31.748]  Senator Frank Church, over two decades ago, chaired the Senate hearings on the FBI COINTELPRO operation, which spied upon, attempted to infiltrate, disrupt and discredit the peace movement, even Martin Luther King, he said.
[00:54:32.523 --> 00:54:40.029]  If a dictator ever took over the NSA, this is a quote, could enable him to impose total tyranny and there would be no way to fight back.
[00:54:40.289 --> 00:54:41.230]  That's now what's happening.
[00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:46.894]  An incredible article that Paul Watson and I put together called the Panopticon up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:47.014 --> 00:54:48.415]  Everybody has got to read it.
[00:54:48.475 --> 00:54:50.397]  It's kind of a synopsis of everything that's going on.
[00:54:50.677 --> 00:54:51.277]  Well, not everything.
[00:54:51.317 --> 00:54:55.280]  It's actually a small drop, but it's more than most people even know about and it's quite horrible.
[00:54:56.241 --> 00:55:01.065]  From James Bamford's NSA, the agency that could be Big Brother, Senator Church said,
[00:55:02.501 --> 00:55:14.027]  That capacity at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capacity to monitor everything, telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter, there would be no place to hide.
[00:55:14.307 --> 00:55:20.090]  He added that if a dictator ever took over the NSA could enable him to impose total tyranny and there would be no way to fight back.
[00:55:20.797 --> 00:55:25.662]  At the time, the agency had the ability to listen to only what people said over the telephone or wrote in an occasional telegram.
[00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:39.835]  They had no access to private letters, but today, while people expressing their innermost thoughts on email messages, exposing their medical and financial records to the internet, and chatting constantly on cell phones, the agency virtually has the ability to get inside a person's mind.
[00:55:40.356 --> 00:55:44.700]  Quote, this is Frank Church, I don't want to see the country ever go across that bridge,
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:59.930]  Frank Church said, I know the capacity that is there to make total tyranny in America and we must see to it that the agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross that abyss.
[00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:02.271]  This is the abyss from which there is no return.
[00:56:02.752 --> 00:56:07.175]  And the quotes go on and on, but because of time, because of ranting, I can't do that anymore.
[00:56:09.376 --> 00:56:10.337]  Continuing here,
[00:56:12.089 --> 00:56:19.976]  National Security Agency mounted massive spy op on Baltimore Peace Group documents show.
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:24.583]  And this is from the Raw Story, but it links into a bunch of different mainstream articles that have been reporting it.
[00:56:24.843 --> 00:56:27.686]  The National Security Agency has been spying on Baltimore Anti-War Group.
[00:56:27.986 --> 00:56:30.508]  They've had on-the-ground Defense Department troops doing it.
[00:56:30.708 --> 00:56:32.410]  I've had them video tape me for years.
[00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:33.771]  I mean, march up to me.
[00:56:34.011 --> 00:56:37.394]  Tell me to turn cameras off when I'm in Central Texas.
[00:56:37.454 --> 00:56:38.454]  I mean, this is sickening.
[00:56:39.115 --> 00:56:39.776]  Off bases.
[00:56:39.816 --> 00:56:42.378]  I mean, just, you know, Belton, Texas, if you've seen the video.
[00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:47.582]  I mean, they don't just, they tell you, the troops tell you to turn cameras off in this new cesspit.
[00:56:48.323 --> 00:57:02.323]  The National Security Agency has been spying on Baltimore anti-war group, according to documents released during litigation, going so far as to document the infiltration of protesters, balloons, and intentions to deploy units trained to detect weapons of mass destruction.
[00:57:02.703 --> 00:57:04.947]  Raw story as learned, according to the documents, the pledge of
[00:57:05.747 --> 00:57:14.074]  Resistance Baltimore, a Quaker-linked peace group, has been monitored by the NSA working with the Baltimore Intelligence Unit for the Baltimore City Police Department.
[00:57:14.314 --> 00:57:32.047]  The documents came as a result of litigation in the August 3rd trial of Marilyn Carlisle and Cindy Farquhar, an NSA security official, provided the documents with the redacted action plan and the redaction copy of the Joint Terrorism Task Force email about the activities of the Pledge of Resistance activities.
[00:57:32.944 --> 00:57:35.666]  And then it goes into how the NSA was set up and what it's doing.
[00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:38.969]  But I mean, there they are, just purely sneaking around.
[00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:42.071]  But, again, it's always how a leftist group's being spied on.
[00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:45.513]  Where's the national media taking the video from Police State 2000?
[00:57:46.214 --> 00:57:59.544]  Or Road to Tyranny and going, oh look, in Road to Tyranny, I mean, it's been in World Net Daily how we've had Delta Force troops come over and aim guns at us and take our videotape away and shred it right in front of us.
[00:58:00.538 --> 00:58:03.500]  And then, you know, World Wide Daily called up and got the Army to admit it.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:09.785]  I mean, I've had troops, you understand me, they put Mike Hanson in handcuffs, okay?
[00:58:10.186 --> 00:58:13.128]  Because he was smart enough to, well, this is a free country.
[00:58:13.768 --> 00:58:15.049]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:16.170]  Do you understand that?
[00:58:16.971 --> 00:58:25.798]  Do you understand I've been in Belton, Texas, and had Army troops, regular Army, with special forces patches, come over and get in my face?
[00:58:26.681 --> 00:58:31.704]  I mean, there's just folks... I mean, that's why people are going, Alex Jones knew all about this!
[00:58:31.744 --> 00:58:32.545]  How did he know?
[00:58:32.565 --> 00:58:35.166]  Because I've had them come up to me a whole bunch!
[00:58:35.186 --> 00:58:36.907]  I mean, they're all over the place!
[00:58:37.308 --> 00:58:38.989]  Most of them are running the smack!
[00:58:39.329 --> 00:58:40.029]  And the flake!
[00:58:42.651 --> 00:58:46.914]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.548 --> 00:58:59.188]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.848 --> 00:59:00.889]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.629 --> 00:59:02.829]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.389 --> 00:59:04.229]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.949 --> 00:59:05.849]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.869 --> 00:59:10.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:14.831]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:26.333]  You know, a lot of times you miss the forest for the trees, and now they're admitting, oh, it's illegal to have troops spying on the American people, and it's illegal to have the NSA doing it.
[00:59:27.006 --> 00:59:29.047]  The NSA's been doing this for decades, admittedly.
[00:59:29.067 --> 00:59:30.608]  That came out in church's committees.
[00:59:31.188 --> 00:59:35.131]  It's funny, I was talking about it the other day, and folks have gone and grabbed all the quotes where he did go public with it.
[00:59:36.211 --> 00:59:40.274]  But now, I've forgotten about all the places I've been.
[00:59:40.314 --> 00:59:48.558]  I mean, in America, in little towns and big cities where I've had troops detain us, or troops come over and aim guns at us, or troops get in our faces.
[00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:52.781]  And one time, of course, we didn't get the footage because they took it away from us, and that was in the news.
[00:59:53.201 --> 00:59:55.122]  And they admitted, they erased the tape.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.422]  So technically they didn't take the tape away, they just erased it.
[01:00:00.023 --> 01:00:02.425]  So that's the kind of stuff they do.
[01:00:02.445 --> 01:00:04.807]  And you're like, well, what did you have on tape?
[01:00:04.907 --> 01:00:05.268]  Nothing.
[01:00:05.328 --> 01:00:05.648]  Them.
[01:00:06.609 --> 01:00:08.030]  Just not even running an operation.
[01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:09.932]  It was the day after the operation, down in San Antonio.
[01:00:10.192 --> 01:00:17.078]  They were real mad that I had the police chief saying they tried to bribe him and that he'd kicked them out and they'd come into town anyways and they were just real angry about it.
[01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:26.216]  You know, I mean, there's these guys in plain clothes pointing at us, getting real mad, all of a sudden these big MPs come running over, you know, give us that camera!
[01:00:26.897 --> 01:00:34.160]  Hanson starts arguing with them, so the firearms come out, and this is America, folks, and they can't wait!
[01:00:34.961 --> 01:00:40.223]  Most of these people, I'm going to be frank with you, I mean, you know how dumb the general public is, or dumbed down, or ignorant.
[01:00:40.644 --> 01:00:43.845]  Well, just imagine the military, I mean, they'll do whatever they tell them.
[01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:47.027]  We don't like confiscating the guns of New Orleans, but we'll do it!
[01:00:47.651 --> 01:00:52.192]  And I'm not trying to be mean, folks, but I mean, the Founding Fathers are spinning in their graves.
[01:00:54.013 --> 01:00:56.894]  And, you know, all of this is happening, all of this is going on.
[01:00:57.254 --> 01:01:04.496]  We got Dr. Dennis Cuddy coming up here after this quick break, and I want to get into his book cover-up, Government Spin or Truth?
[01:01:04.516 --> 01:01:06.677]  Some of the things that he covered in that.
[01:01:07.477 --> 01:01:11.198]  And Dr. Dennis Cuddy, historian and political analyst, received a Ph.D.
[01:01:11.238 --> 01:01:13.739]  from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
[01:01:15.189 --> 01:01:17.451]  Major American history, minor political science.
[01:01:17.471 --> 01:01:19.232]  Dr. Cuddy has taught at the university level.
[01:01:19.452 --> 01:01:25.617]  He's been a political and economic risk analyst, an international consulting firm, and has been a senior associate with the U.S.
[01:01:25.637 --> 01:01:26.558]  Department of Education.
[01:01:26.898 --> 01:01:29.961]  He has also testified before members of the Congress on behalf of the U.S.
[01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:30.801]  Department of Justice.
[01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:39.848]  Dr. Cuddy has authored or edited 17 books and booklets, and written hundreds of articles appearing in newspapers, including the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, USA Today.
[01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:43.051]  He's been a guest on numerous radio talk shows in various parts of the country.
[01:01:43.531 --> 01:01:55.738]  And he will join us, he's been with us many times, coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:55.938 --> 01:02:00.000]  And I want to get in to these claims of executive power.
[01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:07.984]  I mean, where this new Supreme Court Justice, or the guy they're nominating, says Bush is above the law in memos, and now he's trying to say he didn't say that.
[01:02:08.004 --> 01:02:12.747]  And just the nature of this other Bush administration official, I don't know if he's aware of it,
[01:02:13.337 --> 01:02:17.439]  But this you character saying, yes, the President can kidnap people's children.
[01:02:18.179 --> 01:02:25.982]  He was asked, you know, you've written, Mr. You, that they can grab them, torture small children in front of their parents, and even crush their genitalia.
[01:02:26.002 --> 01:02:27.382]  I don't want to get into more graphic, Nate.
[01:02:27.682 --> 01:02:29.803]  And he says, yeah, the President has that power if he wants to.
[01:02:30.403 --> 01:02:32.564]  And everybody knows the President doesn't have the power.
[01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:38.413]  You know, that Nero claimed he had to strangle a small child for his enjoyment every morning.
[01:02:39.273 --> 01:02:40.054]  You know, in Rome.
[01:02:40.114 --> 01:02:47.599]  But, I mean, Hitler didn't have the power to, you know, to send people to firing squads for no reason, just because they were a certain group of people.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.261]  They do not have this power.
[01:02:50.321 --> 01:02:55.325]  That is, I mean, in 1215, the king learned that in England at running meet.
[01:02:56.346 --> 01:03:01.890]  So, we'll come back and talk to Dr. Dennis Cuddy for 55 minutes, and then we've got Pastor Butch Paw coming on.
[01:03:02.893 --> 01:03:14.637]  With us in the third hour, we'll talk about rendering unto Caesar, and how they've taken over the churches, and all these false doctrines for people that think they're following the Bible out there, that think the Bible says that... I mean, I've actually heard them say George Bush may be Jesus.
[01:03:14.717 --> 01:03:21.860]  I mean, they really go, he actually has the Lord in him, he's like a disciple, or he may even be kind of like God.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:24.081]  I mean, actually, it's blasphemous.
[01:03:24.861 --> 01:03:29.803]  And so, we'll talk about some of this mental illness with Pastor Butch coming up as well.
[01:03:30.675 --> 01:03:33.078]  But, Dr. Dennis Cuddy on the other side.
[01:03:33.098 --> 01:03:36.842]  And yes, we carry his book cover-up, Government Spin or Truth.
[01:03:36.862 --> 01:03:41.227]  We've got it linked up on the main page of InfoWars.com right now.
[01:03:42.448 --> 01:03:43.029]  Stay with us.
[01:03:43.149 --> 01:03:44.590]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:48.414]  We'll also tell you about some of the websites and news services that Dr. Cuddy writes for.
[01:03:48.775 --> 01:03:52.339]  So you can go find those online and read those to your heart's content.
[01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:58.258]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.518 --> 01:04:00.100]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.123]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.464 --> 01:04:12.189]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.509 --> 01:04:14.490]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.690 --> 01:04:17.551]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.631 --> 01:04:22.292]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:26.894]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:34.356]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:04:54.608 --> 01:05:03.231]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:03.451 --> 01:05:14.714]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:14.934 --> 01:05:17.595]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:17.935 --> 01:05:22.036]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:05:22.236 --> 01:05:24.397]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:24.537 --> 01:05:26.417]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:26.617 --> 01:05:32.639]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:32.879 --> 01:05:38.501]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:05:55.154 --> 01:06:02.016]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:06:02.156 --> 01:06:15.080]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.061]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:06:17.261 --> 01:06:20.703]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:06:20.983 --> 01:06:24.765]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:06:25.026 --> 01:06:29.989]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[01:06:44.597 --> 01:06:51.659]  We haven't got our guests until the end of the hour, so I don't want to spend all day on this.
[01:06:51.699 --> 01:06:54.880]  But out of the gates, I want to get Dr. Dennis Cuddy's comments.
[01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:20.592]  On one of the little creatures that was at the same level as our current Attorney General as a White House Counsel.
[01:07:21.873 --> 01:07:30.219]  And they said that other than Gonzales as a Counsel, John Yoo was the individual he listened to most, obviously.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.002]  And Yoo wrote that genocide is acceptable.
[01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:34.883]  He actually wrote that.
[01:07:35.925 --> 01:07:42.868]  And he wrote that they can torture a small child and crush their genitals, their testicles is the exact thing, in front of the parents.
[01:07:43.248 --> 01:07:51.331]  And he was asked that at a big University of Chicago debate with a Notre Dame professor that they were debating, that he was debating, and he said yes.
[01:07:52.431 --> 01:07:53.952]  And that's what Alberto Gonzales said.
[01:07:53.992 --> 01:07:59.834]  He said we can torture them until they die, and if we don't call it torture, then it's not murder.
[01:08:00.569 --> 01:08:01.730]  So, I mean, that's like mental illness.
[01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.931]  You're like a psychopath going, now I'm going to free your soul.
[01:08:04.951 --> 01:08:06.411]  And then slitting someone's throat.
[01:08:06.631 --> 01:08:08.192]  Look at your happiness spill out.
[01:08:08.452 --> 01:08:09.393]  I'm loving you.
[01:08:09.413 --> 01:08:12.634]  Well, you still... And that's what psychopaths do, though.
[01:08:12.654 --> 01:08:14.054]  They go, I'm not killing you.
[01:08:14.315 --> 01:08:15.195]  I'm loving you.
[01:08:16.256 --> 01:08:18.497]  They just change it.
[01:08:18.998 --> 01:08:21.120]  I took a few courses in criminology.
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:25.803]  I don't claim to be some expert in it, but I've probably read about, I'm a big reader, I've probably read about 30 books on it.
[01:08:26.044 --> 01:08:27.485]  I mean, real textbooks on it.
[01:08:27.885 --> 01:08:31.308]  Not just little crime and murder, you know, criminology garbage.
[01:08:31.328 --> 01:08:32.849]  I mean, I really tried to get into it.
[01:08:32.929 --> 01:08:34.250]  Well, you've heard the guest over the years.
[01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:35.531]  We've interviewed a lot of them here.
[01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:42.157]  A lot of top psychologists and psychiatrists and sociologists as well, and then police investigators, detectives, FBI.
[01:08:42.837 --> 01:08:45.138]  I mean, this is classic crazy behavior.
[01:08:45.498 --> 01:08:50.841]  It's like Karl Rove telling the New York Times, we control reality, and we'll change reality tomorrow.
[01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:53.382]  It's almost like a sickness elites get.
[01:08:53.743 --> 01:08:58.045]  But enough about that, I want to get just out of the gate Dr. Dennis Cuddy, who of course
[01:08:58.965 --> 01:09:05.709]  Works in the Department of Education, he's written for Washington Post, USA Today, The Globalist, tried to recruit him, he has a degree, Ph.D.
[01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:12.812]  in American History and Political Science, and we're honored to have this author and researcher on with us.
[01:09:13.132 --> 01:09:16.234]  Dr. Cuddy, there's so much happening, I mean, it's mind-blowing.
[01:09:17.477 --> 01:09:17.937]  You're right.
[01:09:18.817 --> 01:09:25.759]  The way they get around things, and President Bush gets around saying we're not torturing, is they simply redefine it.
[01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.460]  They don't consider waterboarding, for example, as torture.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.761]  They just redefine the word torture and then say, well, we're not doing it.
[01:09:32.741 --> 01:09:38.743]  And then, of course, if you try and find out what's going on in the secret CIA prisons around the world, well, you know, that's classified.
[01:09:38.803 --> 01:09:39.943]  We can't talk about that.
[01:09:40.123 --> 01:09:40.383]  So on.
[01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:46.648]  And you're also right when you said, Derek, you're going to be on later with Pastor Butch about mental illness.
[01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:56.696]  That's one of the things that the Bush's New Freedom Commission, note the term freedom, wants to do is check out your possible mental illness.
[01:09:56.736 --> 01:09:58.557]  You, me, and everybody else.
[01:09:58.637 --> 01:10:00.218]  That's why they formed this commission.
[01:10:00.959 --> 01:10:05.983]  At the same time, they funded a National Science Foundation, a National Institute of Mental Health study
[01:10:06.676 --> 01:10:21.183]  At over a million dollars, they determined, these experts at Johns Hopkins and UCLA and so forth, that if you have certain dogmatic ways or dogmatic beliefs, then you might have a mental illness problem and need some treatment.
[01:10:21.524 --> 01:10:22.804]  Well, it's the Soviet Union.
[01:10:22.864 --> 01:10:24.805]  I mean, it's that classical model.
[01:10:25.185 --> 01:10:32.129]  Most of the time in China today, when they grab you for quote, re-education, they do it with top scientists, government officials, you name it, police,
[01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:35.790]  He's going away for a few years for mental illness.
[01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:37.511]  He'll come back, though.
[01:10:37.551 --> 01:10:38.371]  He'll be okay, then.
[01:10:38.391 --> 01:10:42.352]  Yeah, that's a little book out about 40 years ago.
[01:10:42.412 --> 01:10:46.553]  They had a movie on it called The Children's Story, where they do this.
[01:10:46.634 --> 01:10:50.475]  This woman comes in, and she's got her green uniform, and she's the new teacher.
[01:10:51.035 --> 01:10:53.316]  And she does a psyops on the kids.
[01:10:53.376 --> 01:10:56.917]  The kids are all sitting there, and they're going along with her psyops.
[01:10:58.092 --> 01:11:02.336]  Uh, what they should do for this new future, this new world, brave new world of the future.
[01:11:02.556 --> 01:11:05.178]  And one little child, you know, he sort of objects to this.
[01:11:05.579 --> 01:11:06.600]  And he says, where's my dad?
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.481]  Well, he's gone off for re-education.
[01:11:09.622 --> 01:11:11.724]  All the children, do you like the American flag?
[01:11:11.864 --> 01:11:12.265]  Oh, yes.
[01:11:12.365 --> 01:11:17.710]  Well, wouldn't it be nice if we cut it up in little pieces so that you could have, each of you, a little piece of it?
[01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:21.373]  And the kids are all, this is great stuff for this one kid.
[01:11:21.453 --> 01:11:23.535]  And of course, you know, he's going to get his in the end.
[01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:36.774]  You know, Dr. Cuddy, I mean, you're a political scientist, and we've had other political scientists on, Paul Craig Roberts, Morgan Reynolds, I mean, I had two CIA guys on last week, they had to admit
[01:11:37.772 --> 01:11:39.693]  Now this NSA individual is blowing the whistle.
[01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:43.456]  You read what Frank Church said about a total dictatorship of the NSA.
[01:11:44.096 --> 01:11:52.082]  I mean, this is the classical re-education mass mind control, but it's not being done in sports stadiums with movie screens.
[01:11:52.102 --> 01:11:54.623]  It's being done with the TV and the sports and the culture.
[01:11:55.404 --> 01:11:58.166]  And then the globalists even brag that they're mind controlling us.
[01:11:58.226 --> 01:12:04.430]  I mean, I don't think the average listener, even though they may be on board with us, realizes this is actually stated, is it not?
[01:12:06.093 --> 01:12:09.096]  Yeah, and it's across the board.
[01:12:09.457 --> 01:12:11.099]  You have the way prepared.
[01:12:11.399 --> 01:12:15.044]  There are what I would call probes of the American psyche.
[01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.586]  Terri Schiavo was a probe.
[01:12:16.646 --> 01:12:19.650]  She wasn't the worst case of the first, but she was a probe to see what
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.820]  The American people would be willing to do so.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.621]  Trial balloon conditioning mechanism.
[01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:24.801]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:12:24.861 --> 01:12:36.004]  Isn't this a trial balloon though, when they constantly go, yeah, torturing kids is good, and then simultaneously every drama is CIA torturing small children in front of their parents, but it's to stop the nuke going off.
[01:12:36.064 --> 01:12:38.685]  So see, they're mass changing our worldview.
[01:12:39.905 --> 01:12:42.806]  Well, not only that, they test in advance.
[01:12:43.046 --> 01:12:46.507]  If you recall, right after 9-11, there were two, basically two surveys.
[01:12:47.485 --> 01:13:01.274]  Too quick, for my comfort, that very afternoon ABC, Washington Post came out with a poll and found that two-thirds of the American public would be willing to give up some of their freedoms in order to have safety and security.
[01:13:01.675 --> 01:13:05.117]  But there was a second poll and it says, do you think torture would be okay?
[01:13:05.157 --> 01:13:08.319]  And roughly two-thirds said, sure, you know, it would save my life.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.741]  The life of Americans, torture is acceptable.
[01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:24.144]  And that's what mind control does, is it tries to make the changes right when the trauma has just happened, because they say the trauma in mind control unfreezes the hardened parameters of your worldview and your moral compass.
[01:13:24.424 --> 01:13:27.805]  Then as it's unfrozen, they then try to change its form.
[01:13:28.766 --> 01:13:37.188]  Yeah, and that again, it goes back to Tavistock, which is a British sort of intelligence, you know, psyops, outfit, among other things.
[01:13:38.274 --> 01:13:46.718]  They would develop, let's say, the Theory of Social Turbulence, where people would go into psychological retreat, they found, if you confront them with crises.
[01:13:46.778 --> 01:13:53.561]  And so, what they did, they hooked up with an outfit that was partly founded by the NEA, National Education Association.
[01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:55.502]  It was called National Training Laboratories.
[01:13:56.082 --> 01:14:04.926]  And the NTL came out in 1962 with a book called Issues in Human Relations Training, where they said their sensitivity training, they always give it a nice name, was, quote, brainwashing, quote.
[01:14:04.966 --> 01:14:05.947]  They said that, flat out.
[01:14:07.358 --> 01:14:07.618]  I don't know.
[01:14:28.378 --> 01:14:37.786]  Simple mind control at the most base level is who your heroes are, because then you're going to model yourself after them and spend all your time becoming educated on that.
[01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:40.027]  They don't care if you know all about football scores.
[01:14:40.287 --> 01:14:41.949]  They do care if you know about your Bill of Rights.
[01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:43.410]  Absolutely.
[01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:49.715]  And the whistleblower you were talking about, he was on, I think it was Nightline last night with Brian Ross, saying exactly that.
[01:14:49.755 --> 01:14:57.761]  He says, well, looks like we'll have to wipe away the Bill of Rights if the American people are going to accept this eavesdropping and surveillance without court authority.
[01:14:59.582 --> 01:15:04.829]  And then in terms of the Middle East, Bush said, didn't he say God spoke to him and told him to invade Iraq?
[01:15:04.869 --> 01:15:07.392]  I think he said that over when he was visiting the Middle East.
[01:15:07.412 --> 01:15:08.774]  He said, God told me to do this.
[01:15:08.794 --> 01:15:10.295]  Yeah, that's total manipulation.
[01:15:10.316 --> 01:15:16.804]  Of course, we know who his God really is from all of your extensive study, Dr. Cuddy, and working at high levels in the federal government.
[01:15:17.785 --> 01:15:18.566]  Who is his God?
[01:15:19.622 --> 01:15:23.886]  Well, he would say the God of the Bible.
[01:15:24.007 --> 01:15:30.633]  However, he also says that's the same God as the Muslims have, and he does a lot of things I don't consider very Christian.
[01:15:30.673 --> 01:15:40.443]  He flashes that middle finger a lot, uses foul language, says he likes Ozzy Osbourne and all of the nasty things that he's done, so I would not consider him a traditional Christian at all.
[01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:44.747]  Well, he also goes to Skull and Bones of Bohemian Grove.
[01:15:44.767 --> 01:15:45.668]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:15:46.389 --> 01:15:51.133]  And mainstream news admits they bus in gay porn stars and run around drunk naked.
[01:15:51.153 --> 01:15:57.598]  And when I was there for the one day, what was on the itinerary, what I'd heard, you know, for that one day was absolutely true.
[01:15:57.618 --> 01:16:04.985]  I mean, worshipping an old Canaanite god is... I mean, I want to... Dr. Cuddy, I want to specifically, before we get into all these other issues,
[01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:09.688]  I want to get your take, though, on their mindsets.
[01:16:09.768 --> 01:16:18.052]  I mean, when they're openly going, yeah, I think we can torture children and crush their genitalia, I mean, that is just... What's going to come next if they're already to that level?
[01:16:19.253 --> 01:16:21.594]  Well, you sort of follow the bouncing ball.
[01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:34.541]  The Terry Chabot thing, for example, was part of a long plan that I wrote about called the Aletheia Report, which mapped out year by year by year what they would do, how they would get to that level, and the American public accepting it.
[01:16:35.443 --> 01:16:37.124]  Same thing with an invasion of Iraq.
[01:16:37.144 --> 01:16:42.027]  You know, they do these test groups, trial balloons, as you said, to find out what we'll accept.
[01:16:42.107 --> 01:16:43.868]  Okay, so now we've accepted abortion.
[01:16:44.489 --> 01:16:45.750]  We've accepted euthanasia.
[01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:47.130]  We've accepted eugenics.
[01:16:47.471 --> 01:16:48.911]  We've accepted infanticide.
[01:16:48.931 --> 01:16:52.874]  I mean, it's going on in hospitals all over the place.
[01:16:53.034 --> 01:16:59.578]  We're now at the stage of accepting, in other terms, one world currency.
[01:17:01.165 --> 01:17:07.628]  They've got us pretty much ready to accept anything if the right crisis comes along.
[01:17:07.888 --> 01:17:08.348]  Exactly.
[01:17:08.368 --> 01:17:12.409]  It seems like we've reached what they call a jump point.
[01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:15.871]  A major leap because now the transponders are going in.
[01:17:16.211 --> 01:17:17.931]  Now the mass toll roads are going in.
[01:17:18.191 --> 01:17:20.172]  Now they're admitting they're tracking our cell phones.
[01:17:20.452 --> 01:17:22.793]  Now they're saying torture is good.
[01:17:23.053 --> 01:17:25.514]  Now they're admitting there's some camps for our safety.
[01:17:26.565 --> 01:17:38.197]  Yeah, and in fact, the former FBI agent Dan Smoot, about 50 years ago, one of his newsletters mentioned that may be what they were buying up all that territory in Alaska for.
[01:17:38.257 --> 01:17:46.145]  He says they don't need that much territory just for 400 mental patients in Alaska back in the 50s, so he was suspicious back then about what they were going to do with us.
[01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:47.831]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:17:47.851 --> 01:17:59.547]  I mean, we have hearings from the 80s in the open Senate where they're admitting that Bill Camps and then the heads, you know, the head chairman says shut up to Brooks, Congressman Jack Brooks, in that joint session of the House and the Senate.
[01:17:59.947 --> 01:18:01.550]  So, you know, I'm in that joint committee meeting.
[01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:02.331]  I should be accurate.
[01:18:03.352 --> 01:18:10.838]  I don't think people understand that they've been slowly building towards this goal, and that's really the nature of the New World Order that the average person can't figure out.
[01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:15.082]  They've got us all playing on a month-to-month or paycheck-to-paycheck time board.
[01:18:15.382 --> 01:18:17.604]  They're playing on a hundred-year map, aren't they?
[01:18:19.005 --> 01:18:21.107]  Yeah, but it's getting close.
[01:18:21.227 --> 01:18:22.308]  I'll get to that in a second.
[01:18:22.868 --> 01:18:25.711]  In a way, as you said, to cut off Jack Brooks.
[01:18:26.415 --> 01:18:29.957]  But Gonzalez, Henry Gonzalez later said, yeah, they do have these plans.
[01:18:30.458 --> 01:18:39.783]  The timetable is 2018 for the new global currency called the Phoenix, and then 2025 for the global religion according to Alice Bailey's plan.
[01:18:41.324 --> 01:18:46.247]  But on the road to that, I mean, it's just... I want to get your take when we get back.
[01:18:46.367 --> 01:18:48.408]  When will the mass extermination begin?
[01:18:48.429 --> 01:18:49.749]  I mean, we know that's their stated goal.
[01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.751]  When does that happen?
[01:18:51.771 --> 01:18:52.331]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:56.235 --> 01:18:57.277]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:18:57.617 --> 01:19:00.401]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:00.662 --> 01:19:04.828]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:19:05.248 --> 01:19:06.090]  So what do you do?
[01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:10.977]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:19:11.437 --> 01:19:13.558]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:19:14.058 --> 01:19:28.764]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:28.804 --> 01:19:35.847]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.922]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.942 --> 01:20:05.229]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[01:20:05.809 --> 01:20:15.718]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[01:20:16.438 --> 01:20:22.604]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[01:20:23.343 --> 01:20:31.025]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:55.331]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:55.732 --> 01:21:01.218]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:01.799 --> 01:21:02.299]  That's right.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.902]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:05.223 --> 01:21:12.391]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:12.944 --> 01:21:20.631]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:21.072 --> 01:21:25.936]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:26.557 --> 01:21:29.580]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:32.342 --> 01:21:36.485]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:36.865 --> 01:21:37.105]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:39.067]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:39.127 --> 01:21:39.447]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:39.747 --> 01:21:40.267]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.288 --> 01:21:42.449]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:42.469 --> 01:21:45.271]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:59.696 --> 01:22:07.586]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:07.806 --> 01:22:11.831]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.
[01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:15.355]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[01:22:15.755 --> 01:22:20.138]  We can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:22:20.538 --> 01:22:22.219]  Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:23.881]  For more information call 702-953-0267.

[01:22:45.715 --> 01:22:45.996]  0267 today.
[01:22:57.415 --> 01:22:59.877]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:23:00.418 --> 01:23:03.160]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:07.063]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:11.607]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:23:12.148 --> 01:23:13.929]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:23:14.069 --> 01:23:19.334]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy, I mean, the New World Order master plan, controlled by these big central banking elites out of Europe.
[01:23:20.004 --> 01:23:23.967]  Every time I turn around, it's population reduction, one-child policy, China's their model.
[01:23:24.328 --> 01:23:27.350]  They openly say they want to reduce this from 80 to 95 percent.
[01:23:28.131 --> 01:23:31.753]  They admit they want to build these big, massive inner-city control grids.
[01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:39.259]  I mean, already they're engaging in extermination through the vaccines and the foods and the things we've caught them doing in Africa and Asia.
[01:23:39.299 --> 01:23:44.323]  That's, you know, Henry Kissinger documents about sterilized half-year women or you won't get any IMF or World Bank money.
[01:23:44.864 --> 01:23:48.967]  But here in the Western world, worldwide, I mean, what do you see happening?
[01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:53.552]  Well, it's different things for different places.
[01:23:53.932 --> 01:24:06.421]  As you said, there's AIDS in Africa, bird flu will pop up with a pandemic in Asia, the National Security Memorandum 200 that you mentioned about Kissinger in terms of aid, unless you allow us to have population control.
[01:24:07.201 --> 01:24:13.506]  The ultimate goal, as you said, Sam Keane at the First Gorbachev Conference 95 said we need a reduction of
[01:24:14.485 --> 01:24:18.187]  90% of the world's population, all the elitists there were clapping like mad.
[01:24:18.267 --> 01:24:19.167]  They thought that was great.
[01:24:19.268 --> 01:24:23.990]  Jacques Cousteau with his 350,000 a day need to be eliminated.
[01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:35.955]  In the West, what's most likely, and you get sort of a sense of it from if President Bush, for example, was really serious about terrorism, he would have closed the borders.
[01:24:36.075 --> 01:24:39.197]  So my guess is you might have a nuclear device slip in.
[01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:47.503]  From the South, it probably, and I've written about this in a column called Babylon Has Fallen, would be a large place, New York City perhaps.
[01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:49.465]  It's right out of the Book of Revelation.
[01:24:50.025 --> 01:24:57.870]  And when that type of thing happens, then Tommy Franks, General Franks' comment, cigar aficionado, kicks in that Americans will accept the military dictatorship.
[01:24:58.651 --> 01:25:03.974]  Of course, you have to have the gun confiscation, so they've been doing military exercises already for decades.
[01:25:04.375 --> 01:25:09.118]  And that Marine survey, remember, 25% of the Marines said they'd be willing to shoot somebody
[01:25:09.954 --> 01:25:14.016]  I videotaped them trying to do it seven years ago.
[01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:26.922]  Right, and what happens is, in case there are some American soldiers who won't do that, there was a 1952 map by a world government group showing what nations would be policing other nations when the New World Order came.
[01:25:26.942 --> 01:25:30.284]  And now that exact map is this troop-sharing deal they've had.
[01:25:30.844 --> 01:25:37.107]  Yep, but it said at that time we would be in Kazakhstan and all those stands where we are, Yugoslavia where we are, Australia where we are, so on.
[01:25:37.617 --> 01:25:39.458]  This is all an official plan, folks!
[01:26:02.231 --> 01:26:05.233]  As you said, the plan goes back a long time.
[01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.494]  British Fabians, Wells, H.G.
[01:26:07.514 --> 01:26:11.978]  Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, all of them said we need to kill people.
[01:26:12.058 --> 01:26:15.100]  Russell said we need a black death, bacteriological warfare.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.122]  And what did President Bush recently allow to happen?
[01:26:19.043 --> 01:26:24.707]  There was a release, less than three years after the war began, of Dr. Death and Dr. Germ, those two women.
[01:26:25.331 --> 01:26:25.992]  Over in Iraq.
[01:26:26.032 --> 01:26:26.913]  Now, why would you do that?
[01:26:27.393 --> 01:26:31.798]  And why wouldn't you close the southern border with the U.S.
[01:26:32.018 --> 01:26:37.264]  if the Mexican officials, as they have already said, some Al-Qaeda members have been slipping across the border?
[01:26:37.964 --> 01:26:39.726]  And so we're being set up.
[01:26:40.086 --> 01:26:46.373]  My guess is it'll probably be some sort of nuke in the U.S., as I said, New York City.
[01:26:47.434 --> 01:26:56.137]  But it's part, you really, those are crises, and the American public, yes, they do respond to crises, but you have to set the framework for the crisis.
[01:26:56.797 --> 01:27:05.460]  And so, if I might, for just a few minutes, I want to get into something which will connect exactly with what you're saying.
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:13.322]  And at first, it doesn't seem that way, but what you have to remember is years ago, Kissinger, who was a protege of David Rockefeller,
[01:27:14.156 --> 01:27:43.925]  uh... was with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and in the fifties they issued a document saying that we're going to have to have this quote new world order they use that term and he said it wouldn't just be social economic political it would be spiritual as well so what they have to do is condition the public spiritually now how do you do that you don't have an assault you know down with christianity down with judaism you know down with the ten commandments you set the groundwork until now and so now you see the assault and I'll have to explain this as to what's happening
[01:27:44.791 --> 01:27:54.956]  There is a big court case recently in Texas, and they're also trying to mandate this legislatively in Alabama, a textbook called the Bible and its Influence.
[01:27:55.557 --> 01:28:01.620]  And it's by the Bible Literacy Project, and what I found is this is largely a communitarian effort which is global.
[01:28:02.509 --> 01:28:03.690]  After the break we can get back.
[01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:04.430]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:09.373]  And communitarian in dictionaries 20 years ago said one who promotes communist systems of government.
[01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:12.575]  Now it says a loving person who helps everyone.
[01:28:12.955 --> 01:28:15.116]  But George Bush says he is a communitarian.
[01:28:15.476 --> 01:28:17.997]  And again folks, communism is a fable.
[01:28:18.037 --> 01:28:23.460]  It is a manufactured false system created by the big banks.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:24.121]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:25.101 --> 01:28:26.002]  We're on the march.
[01:28:26.482 --> 01:28:28.123]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:31.685]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:35.219 --> 01:28:36.341]  You don't love me anymore?
[01:28:36.661 --> 01:28:38.464]  You used to take such good care of me.
[01:28:38.484 --> 01:28:39.966]  Is that my car talking to me?
[01:28:40.107 --> 01:28:40.387]  Yes.
[01:28:40.688 --> 01:28:41.529]  You neglect me.
[01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:43.692]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[01:28:45.475 --> 01:28:46.537]  You're the cheapest gas.
[01:28:46.877 --> 01:28:47.739]  I'm getting sick.
[01:28:48.079 --> 01:28:50.243]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.

[01:31:52.116 --> 01:31:53.557]  They're always corrupt.
[01:31:53.637 --> 01:31:55.938]  And you've just got these imperial dynasties.
[01:31:55.978 --> 01:32:01.642]  People say, well there's no way people generation to generation would keep power and control.
[01:32:19.053 --> 01:32:21.375]  What do universities do generation to generation?
[01:32:21.415 --> 01:32:22.216]  It's a system.
[01:32:23.317 --> 01:32:31.826]  There have been 500 year plus imperial dynasties of royal families.
[01:32:32.467 --> 01:32:33.728]  And that's all the globalists are.
[01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:37.131]  They've just gotten very good at hiding their wealth, not engaging in
[01:32:38.468 --> 01:32:48.696]  Conspicuous consumption, like the robber barons would do 110 years ago, riding around with six white horses pulling their golden carriages around New York City.
[01:32:48.716 --> 01:32:56.723]  The only people that do that today are the Saudi princes, and they're low-level nothings compared to the real elite, and they're about to lose their country because of it.
[01:32:57.367 --> 01:32:59.568]  And the globalists are just pure evil, folks.
[01:32:59.588 --> 01:33:03.969]  I mean, imagine how evil they've got to be and cunning to keep this power generation after generation.
[01:33:04.289 --> 01:33:08.350]  And they learned how to have wars and play each other, you know, off against others.
[01:33:09.391 --> 01:33:20.494]  I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and off the Secure Online Shopping Cart get Dr. Dennis Cuddy's book, Cover-Up, Government Spin or Truth?
[01:33:21.491 --> 01:33:24.554]  And it's just an amazing book that gets into a whole bunch of different issues.
[01:33:24.594 --> 01:33:28.057]  I'm going to ask him to describe what's in the book for you here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:28.157 --> 01:33:30.879]  Also, we're running a lot of new specials.
[01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:38.166]  We're also running a lot of the same specials that we had before New Year's rolled around.
[01:33:38.186 --> 01:33:41.849]  We've got the deal where you get my new film, Order of Death, on the same DVD.
[01:33:41.869 --> 01:33:45.872]  You get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the new updated edition, on the same DVD.
[01:33:47.265 --> 01:33:54.492]  We also have my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, three hours long, three separate films on one film.
[01:33:54.512 --> 01:34:08.907]  It's the police state developments, you know, the troops following us taking video, the New York police, the sound cannons, the tracking grids, the surveillance blimps, and then an hour plus on 9-11 and how the global was carried out and why and all the evidence and how they did it.
[01:34:09.187 --> 01:34:09.888]  It's inclusive.
[01:34:10.348 --> 01:34:18.114]  And then an hour on the Globalist Master Plan, and the Bohemian Grove, and the confrontation with David Gergen, and the Nazi connections, and all of it.
[01:34:18.174 --> 01:34:19.815]  It's such an important video.
[01:34:20.756 --> 01:34:23.678]  And it's very effective, waking a lot of people up.
[01:34:24.038 --> 01:34:25.059]  I think it's my best work.
[01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:27.641]  There's the good old classic, 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[01:34:28.539 --> 01:34:29.780]  There's the Police State Films.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.081]  There's all the other books and videos we're carrying.
[01:34:32.101 --> 01:34:34.882]  We're carrying a lot of other great new books and videos right now.
[01:34:35.342 --> 01:34:40.465]  So go to InfoWars.com and order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[01:34:55.595 --> 01:34:56.556]  Or you can just write to me.

[01:35:02.821 --> 01:35:10.767]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:35:12.068 --> 01:35:20.555]  Dr. Cuddy, it's been about a year since I read Cover-Up, but you get into the documents, their plan, you get into just so many different things in this book.
[01:35:22.476 --> 01:35:23.176]  I mean, you're the author.
[01:35:23.216 --> 01:35:25.177]  You can sum it up better because it covers so much.
[01:35:25.617 --> 01:35:28.158]  What does, I mean, cover-up really get into?
[01:35:29.299 --> 01:35:30.239]  Three basic areas.
[01:35:30.259 --> 01:35:35.601]  9-11, why it happened, how it could have been easily prevented.
[01:35:36.021 --> 01:35:50.147]  I filed a Freedom of Information request also to see if the same top-level people at the Pentagon who met with General Mahmood Ahmad, Pakistani intelligence, who had the 100,000 wired to Mohammed Atta,
[01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:58.534]  If they're the same top Pentagon officials who, the day before 9-11, suddenly cancel their travel plans for the next morning, the morning of 9-11.
[01:35:58.654 --> 01:36:05.779]  I've got an indication about one of them, the others I'm waiting on.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.842]  In terms of Iraq, it gets into that.
[01:36:09.862 --> 01:36:13.004]  Remember, this book came out just as the war was beginning.
[01:36:13.064 --> 01:36:14.665]  Now, there's been an update after that.
[01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:20.009]  But as the war was beginning, I noticed that recently Paul Bremer, the first
[01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:30.067]  Individually, well actually the second, just a month after the first one got bumped, to control the coalition government over there.
[01:36:30.427 --> 01:36:38.410]  It's just come out with a book and he was with Brian Williams of NBC on TV the other night and they were both nodding their head up and down about no one could see the insurgency coming.
[01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:42.672]  Well in this book, that came out just as the war was beginning,
[01:36:43.707 --> 01:36:52.156]  I put in there the comment of exiled Iraqi Lieutenant General Tawfiq al-Yassiri saying exactly what was coming, the insurgency.
[01:36:52.196 --> 01:36:55.139]  They were going to take off the uniforms, they were going underground, the 300, 400,000.
[01:36:57.168 --> 01:37:01.972]  There would be the exact insurgency we've had, but nobody in the Bush administration would listen to that.
[01:37:02.012 --> 01:37:07.717]  But actually, the Israelis in 83 said they want three or four regions, that they want it all broken up and in civil war.
[01:37:07.757 --> 01:37:09.018]  I mean, that's the imperial model.
[01:37:09.559 --> 01:37:18.527]  The Hashemite Kingdom is what the goal was to re-establish it with a permanent military presence, as Project for the New American Century said, in that region.
[01:37:18.967 --> 01:37:24.792]  Because if the world government is, the world socialist government, is going to be linked up by economic regions,
[01:37:25.495 --> 01:37:30.900]  You had to get rid of Milosevic in Europe to have that southern part open so Germany and etc.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:33.162]  could come down into the Mediterranean to trade.
[01:37:34.162 --> 01:37:37.063]  With that region, you needed a stable Middle East region.
[01:37:37.523 --> 01:37:41.184]  Saddam had to go, among other things, oil and so forth.
[01:37:41.204 --> 01:37:51.906]  For that region, in the East, you had to get rid of the Taliban, because UNICAL consultant Khalilzad, who's now the envoy and ambassador... Well, actually, their president was an executive.
[01:37:52.406 --> 01:37:52.986]  Karzai.
[01:37:54.007 --> 01:38:00.028]  Well, Karzai was a UNICAL executive, and Khalilzad was also a UNICAL consultant.
[01:38:00.501 --> 01:38:01.846]  He's now the ambassador to Iraq.
[01:38:01.866 --> 01:38:06.341]  He was the envoy to Afghanistan and Iraq before he became ambassador.
[01:38:06.401 --> 01:38:06.742]  But anyway...
[01:38:07.605 --> 01:38:14.328]  They, the Taliban, wouldn't go along with a pipeline coming down from the Caspian region through Afghanistan down to India.
[01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:18.950]  They said carpet of bombs or carpet of gold, or actually backwards, carpet of gold, carpet of bombs.
[01:38:19.371 --> 01:38:25.634]  And then Bush, of course, had the launch orders to attack Iraq, I mean Afghanistan, on its desk two days before the attack.
[01:38:26.594 --> 01:38:26.974]  Right.
[01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:32.997]  And the reason is, according to Brzezinski, who always sort of forecasts all this stuff on his grand chessboard,
[01:38:33.553 --> 01:38:36.336]  He says that there may be this Muslim backlash, but who cares?
[01:38:36.396 --> 01:38:38.578]  We will manipulate people and so forth.
[01:38:38.618 --> 01:38:50.109]  And he's one of those who was at that same Sam Kean speech at the first Gorbachev conference, and Brzezinski says, we're going to have a world government, but we'll do it by regions first, and then we'll link up the regions.
[01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:51.370]  And so that's how that will happen.
[01:38:52.117 --> 01:38:52.797]  Well, it's like this.
[01:38:52.837 --> 01:38:53.358]  The U.S.
[01:38:53.398 --> 01:39:02.541]  is already signing hundreds of agreements with the E.U., that's signing them with the Asian Union, and the African Union's already operating under these IMF and World Bank and WTO guidelines.
[01:39:03.122 --> 01:39:10.845]  And then they sign a deal to, you know, build a trans-NAFTA highway right through Texas, up into Minnesota, down into Mexico.
[01:39:11.505 --> 01:39:21.370]  It's all official, and the company out of Spain is going to run it, and half of the money from the tickets that they give you, with the new points system, openly goes to this foreign company.
[01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:23.591]  I mean, it's just a hellish system.
[01:39:24.011 --> 01:39:31.215]  I mean, I'm actually now, when you get a ticket, folks, you're paying a tax to a Spanish company, and they're even going to enforce it.
[01:39:32.375 --> 01:39:40.159]  Dr. Cuddy, for those that are just tuning in, describe what the New World Order is for people, and what their total goals are, and then give us some ideas about how to beat it.
[01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:49.069]  Well, Spain is important because that's where Javier Solana came from, and he was put in there by Clinton and Strobe Talbot and Richard Gardner, the Free Road Scholars.
[01:39:49.209 --> 01:39:50.830]  Well, there's also the king over there.
[01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:52.130]  Juan Carlos, right.
[01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:55.210]  He's a big globalist.
[01:39:55.490 --> 01:40:05.852]  The ultimate goal is the world government, world socialist government, put together by economic regions, but it will include spirituality as well, which I want to get into in a minute.
[01:40:06.832 --> 01:40:10.073]  And the way they do this is a dialectical process,
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.242]  Through a series of crises, economic, political, warfare, whatever.
[01:40:14.902 --> 01:40:19.184]  And that's the way they condition the people to go along with these things.
[01:40:19.944 --> 01:40:24.646]  As you said before, and as I said, the public is psychologically prepared.
[01:40:24.686 --> 01:40:26.087]  Rock music didn't just happen.
[01:40:26.707 --> 01:40:28.708]  James Bond didn't just happen.
[01:40:28.728 --> 01:40:32.790]  It was to condition the public to accept immorality while the brave hero does whatever.
[01:40:33.477 --> 01:40:36.038]  Brokeback Mountain today is not by accident.
[01:40:36.078 --> 01:40:40.659]  This is another probe to see what the American public will be willing to put up with.
[01:40:41.239 --> 01:40:42.600]  Your elite controls it.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:43.480]  That's what you said.
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:50.302]  An example of the dynasty that you mentioned would be Nelson Rockefeller has a son, Stephen Rockefeller.
[01:40:50.322 --> 01:40:53.482]  He writes the Earth Charter for Gorbachev and Marie Strong.
[01:40:53.623 --> 01:40:58.344]  His son, Stephen Rockefeller Jr., is now with the Soros Group and with Deutsche Bank and so forth.
[01:40:58.364 --> 01:40:59.684]  The dynasty continues.
[01:41:00.804 --> 01:41:01.705]  David Rockefeller
[01:41:03.036 --> 01:41:09.447]  Uh, also, uh, part of this has been chairman of the CFR, set up the Trilateral Commission, and so on.
[01:41:09.908 --> 01:41:12.212]  They'll use these organizations to
[01:41:13.001 --> 01:41:30.784]  To accomplish the objectives, and the strategy is, through the dialectical process, they would say, let's say Rhodes Scholar Dean Rusk has Lincoln Bloomfield, CFR member, write a document, 62, in which he says, if the communist threat were greatly abated, the West would lose whatever incentive it has for world government.
[01:41:31.144 --> 01:41:36.145]  So you have to have the Soviet Union, but if the Soviet Union collapses, you've got to have a new threat, that's Chinese communists.
[01:41:36.605 --> 01:41:37.885]  So we fund them, right?
[01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:41.086]  Build up their military machine, so that they aren't now a threat.
[01:41:41.522 --> 01:41:43.364]  Alright, so how do you prepare the American public?
[01:41:43.604 --> 01:41:46.366]  Well, you have George Bush come in.
[01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.828]  Pardon me.
[01:41:49.229 --> 01:41:52.592]  And Karl Rove says this is a communitarian effort.
[01:41:52.632 --> 01:41:56.895]  He says Rove introduces communitarianism to Bush through the Washington Post.
[01:41:57.536 --> 01:42:04.342]  Then Bush gets up with Teddy Kennedy and has an education bill, No Child Left Behind, which virtually wipes out local control of education.
[01:42:04.913 --> 01:42:11.415]  Andrew Card comes along on Fox News Sunday and says, I believe supply-side and Keynesian economics is the way to go.
[01:42:11.435 --> 01:42:14.396]  And they also pay off a bunch of reporters to go push all these programs.
[01:42:16.376 --> 01:42:20.257]  We have the government openly just paying reporters to go say they love it.
[01:42:21.117 --> 01:42:31.180]  Right, that's not only Operation Mockingbird in the 40s, but during the 60s, Katharine Graham with the Washington Post is part of this.
[01:42:31.907 --> 01:42:42.216]  What they do is, the CIA guy, Felker is his name, he gets Gloria Steinem, promotes her, they establish the CIA, the feminist movement, to undercut the values of the country.
[01:42:42.336 --> 01:42:44.738]  And then she even writes that in a book!
[01:42:44.778 --> 01:42:46.039]  People, this is not a secret!
[01:42:46.499 --> 01:42:53.785]  I mean, the whole feminist movement was just to get women in the factories to be slaves too, to make sure there's no women at home, to raise the kids so the state can do it.
[01:42:53.965 --> 01:42:55.787]  They openly have documents saying this!
[01:42:56.882 --> 01:43:17.380]  Yeah, and the point is it's a CIA effort, just like the CIA had Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals make up a batch of LSD, and then you give it to Timothy Leary, and Timothy Leary goes through all the... By the way, the father of LSD turned 100 today, and that's all publicly admitted that the government went around, and then when Leary died, it came out that he was FBI, CIA, go ahead.
[01:43:19.002 --> 01:43:23.666]  Yeah, so all of this is by accident, and now the communitarian effort
[01:43:24.605 --> 01:43:27.588]  is to establish common values, a set of shared values.
[01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:30.650]  And if I might, just for a minute, let me whiz through this.
[01:43:31.651 --> 01:43:38.276]  What's happened is this textbook, Bible of Disinfluence Bible Literacy Project, is being pushed in all of the public schools.
[01:43:38.356 --> 01:43:40.818]  Big court case in Texas, legislature in Alabama.
[01:43:41.579 --> 01:43:49.285]  And it really is insidious in that it asks students such things as, if God allows evil things to happen, can God honestly be described as good?
[01:43:50.197 --> 01:43:51.818]  So you undermine the students' belief.
[01:43:51.898 --> 01:43:54.999]  And then even Christians push it like, oh, see, it's literature.
[01:43:55.319 --> 01:43:57.080]  We're going to let the Bible be taught now.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:58.000]  How's that sound?
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:01.341]  And then they create a whole false doctrine and demonize it.
[01:44:02.482 --> 01:44:03.522]  Right, a false doctrine.
[01:44:03.642 --> 01:44:05.183]  And you get students to question it.
[01:44:05.223 --> 01:44:06.303]  That's what the humanists said.
[01:44:06.704 --> 01:44:07.484]  I've written about that.
[01:44:07.524 --> 01:44:11.245]  They said, we'll get students to critically think, question their values, their parents.
[01:44:11.826 --> 01:44:15.127]  The rock musicians said, we want a revolution, a generation gap, and so on.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:35.096]  And so what I did is I find out who these people were, and about half of them on the advisory board of the Bible Literacy Project are communitarians, and a couple of them and a board of directors member have signed this document which said, basically, if you believe in Second Amendment rights for an individual, you're a gunslinger, and that the Second Amendment really doesn't mean that.
[01:44:35.857 --> 01:44:40.841]  And so, it plays into a larger effort which I mentioned about the Earth Charter.
[01:44:41.543 --> 01:44:46.044]  Uh, drafted by Stephen Rockefeller, and that's largely a communitarian effort as well.
[01:44:46.544 --> 01:44:49.885]  Now, your listeners say, oh, well, these flaky one-worlders, what can they do?
[01:44:50.365 --> 01:44:53.946]  What you've got to remember is that the Earth Charter says we're going to have socialism.
[01:44:53.966 --> 01:44:55.686]  We're going to have the Equal Rights Amendment.
[01:44:56.586 --> 01:45:00.327]  Uh, we're going to, uh, have school to work and change your values.
[01:45:01.167 --> 01:45:06.588]  Uh, we're going to, uh, adopt all sort of, uh, reproduction population control.
[01:45:07.228 --> 01:45:10.389]  And, uh, listen to this, wherever you are listening to this show,
[01:45:10.911 --> 01:45:13.932]  Your mayor is probably a member of the U.S.
[01:45:13.992 --> 01:45:14.852]  Conference of Mayors.
[01:45:15.412 --> 01:45:15.672]  Alright?
[01:45:15.792 --> 01:45:18.833]  In 2001, they actually endorsed this stuff.
[01:45:19.213 --> 01:45:26.375]  They endorsed the Earth Charter, its principles... Well, that's all part of Agenda 21, and for those who don't understand, there's federal grants that follow the U.N.
[01:45:26.515 --> 01:45:27.595]  orders, because the U.N.
[01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:31.936]  is a body that has its own documents and agendas written up by these large private
[01:45:32.916 --> 01:45:38.860]  organizations, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, these groups openly, you know, get on C-SPAN and brag about their world government.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:50.467]  They write up the policy and that's why Texas comes out with a point system to on top of the ticket, you know, you get a point system for driving and then that goes to a foreign company, which is an international tax.
[01:45:51.227 --> 01:45:59.012]  You know, it's the same thing, like the exact same zoning rules about you can't build on your land are passed all over the country through federal grants at the same time.
[01:46:00.523 --> 01:46:00.943]  That's right.
[01:46:01.464 --> 01:46:12.468]  And to condition the people, you don't just have this charter, which Gorbachev and the rest of them, Maurice Strong, who's Kofi Annan's right-hand man, are trying to get into international law.
[01:46:12.488 --> 01:46:13.389]  You have these summits.
[01:46:13.849 --> 01:46:18.171]  So a couple of months ago, there were summits held in Chicago, San Diego, Dallas, Atlanta, and so forth.
[01:46:18.809 --> 01:46:23.935]  Around the world to Canada, India, Belgium, and so on, to see how they can implement this stuff.
[01:46:24.235 --> 01:46:27.539]  And so, coordinating with that, you had Clinton and Gorbachev.
[01:46:27.579 --> 01:46:31.343]  And all these big people brainstorm and go, hey, you'll get even more money, you'll move up the chain.
[01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:33.566]  If you can implement, they even have contests locally.
[01:46:33.786 --> 01:46:34.968]  Who can implement faster?
[01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:36.129]  Right.
[01:46:36.429 --> 01:46:37.911]  And so they met at the U.S.
[01:46:37.951 --> 01:46:39.493]  Chamber of Commerce a couple of months ago.
[01:46:40.089 --> 01:46:40.329]  I think?
[01:46:58.709 --> 01:47:06.077]  We can accomplish all this with any people of any faith, as long as no one faith says it has the absolute truth.
[01:47:06.197 --> 01:47:08.740]  Well, you know, out goes, I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.243]  So then you can have your religion as long as you believe Lucifer's good, too.
[01:47:13.244 --> 01:47:13.485]  Right.
[01:47:13.565 --> 01:47:21.513]  And so, what Gorbachev and Strong said is that they want this earth charter to be like a Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, a new Ten Commandments.
[01:47:22.031 --> 01:47:35.056]  That's why I said earlier, that's why it's now that the assault on the Ten Commandments, not back in the 60s with school prayer and so forth, but now, because if you're going to have a new Ten Commandments for Mother Earth, you have to wipe out the old Ten Commandments.
[01:47:35.536 --> 01:47:47.981]  That's why what you find is that while the ACLU and other groups are having these lawsuits against the Ten Commandments on public property, they're not touching the pagan goddess, Themis, who is in all the courts across the land.
[01:47:48.001 --> 01:47:50.803]  She's the one with a blindfold on and scales in her hand.
[01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:54.791]  She's supposedly the daughter of Uranus and Mother Gaia.
[01:47:55.231 --> 01:48:00.793]  And by the way, the globalists all worship, you know, the dominant strain of worshippers are goddess worshippers.
[01:48:01.554 --> 01:48:07.276]  From Athena to Diana to Eulogia, they all have their goddess.
[01:48:08.377 --> 01:48:16.760]  Right, the Skull and Bones are Eulogia, Jean Houston is Athena, and you'll find them on state seals all over the place, Ceres and Minerva.
[01:48:17.852 --> 01:48:21.395]  Demeter for $75,000 taxpayer money in Annapolis.
[01:48:21.495 --> 01:48:22.576]  That's like Paramount.
[01:48:22.616 --> 01:48:24.358]  That's the goddess with the torch in her hand.
[01:48:25.279 --> 01:48:25.479]  Right.
[01:48:25.579 --> 01:48:30.823]  And Quetzalcoatl for $500,000 taxpayer money in San Jose.
[01:48:31.644 --> 01:48:32.905]  Vulcans in Birmingham.
[01:48:32.925 --> 01:48:34.867]  You go in the Library of Congress, there's Neptune.
[01:48:34.907 --> 01:48:36.688]  And when you go in the front door of the U.N.
[01:48:36.728 --> 01:48:37.889]  in New York City, what do you see?
[01:48:37.909 --> 01:48:41.172]  A big statue of Zeus, the god of war.
[01:48:41.813 --> 01:48:42.353]  And the U.N.
[01:48:42.393 --> 01:48:45.796]  Environment Program has what they call an Earth Day Sabbath.
[01:48:46.246 --> 01:48:50.668]  They have a Sabbath newsletter, where kids are approaching the gods.
[01:48:50.708 --> 01:48:53.469]  Now Zeus is Jupiter, you mean Mars is war?
[01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:55.389]  Or maybe I'm getting the two mixed up.
[01:48:55.569 --> 01:48:58.110]  Zeus is the Greek god of war.
[01:48:58.891 --> 01:48:59.151]  Yeah.
[01:48:59.351 --> 01:48:59.631]  Zeus.
[01:48:59.771 --> 01:49:01.912]  Well, I mean, he's over both, isn't he?
[01:49:03.012 --> 01:49:03.312]  Yeah.
[01:49:03.552 --> 01:49:06.793]  And then I guess with Rome, then Mars, I get them all confused.
[01:49:06.833 --> 01:49:07.334]  Right.
[01:49:07.354 --> 01:49:08.114]  Mars is Rome, yeah.
[01:49:09.158 --> 01:49:19.967]  So what they're doing is setting the stage for this new age pagan spirituality, wiping out the Ten Commandments because they know that nothing can be left.
[01:49:20.027 --> 01:49:21.848]  It's not just social, economic, and political.
[01:49:22.488 --> 01:49:27.973]  And as I said, they have the Lords of the Universe and all of these Sabbath programs at the U.N.
[01:49:27.993 --> 01:49:29.234]  So there's a spiritual element.
[01:49:29.294 --> 01:49:33.657]  Remember, your mayor has probably endorsed this wherever you're listening.
[01:49:34.341 --> 01:49:35.682]  Well, they have local U.N.
[01:49:35.742 --> 01:49:38.403]  chapters, and the city of Austin has signed U.N.
[01:49:38.423 --> 01:49:38.823]  agreements.
[01:49:39.324 --> 01:49:39.944]  So has Houston.
[01:49:39.964 --> 01:49:42.745]  We'll be right back with Dr. Dennis Cuddy, final segment.
[01:49:42.765 --> 01:49:51.390]  I tell you, this is a blasted path, like it always does, and we're honored to always have our friend with us, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net.
[01:49:54.551 --> 01:50:01.398]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.

[01:50:19.396 --> 01:50:30.041]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.181 --> 01:50:32.082]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:52:10.618 --> 01:52:11.219]  I think so.
[01:52:30.776 --> 01:52:33.717]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.935 --> 01:53:07.979]  The globalists have got control of the world's resources, but they don't have control of your mind and everything you do.
[01:53:08.699 --> 01:53:12.342]  So, being lustful control freaks, they're trying to do it.
[01:53:12.702 --> 01:53:16.345]  But Dr. Cuddy, from all your research, aren't they destined to fail?
[01:53:17.445 --> 01:53:22.149]  Well, ultimately, but there's a major crisis before then.
[01:53:22.169 --> 01:53:29.274]  I mean, in Revelations, you know, you've got the Babylon is burning, and there's only a remnant left, and there's persecution all over the place.
[01:53:30.231 --> 01:53:32.372]  And you know, they really believe in all that, too.
[01:53:32.412 --> 01:53:34.373]  I mean, they're into it.
[01:53:34.913 --> 01:53:38.395]  Well, and they're playing certain Christians to fulfill it.
[01:53:38.695 --> 01:53:42.497]  They actually have them say, yeah, you know, the end times, great, you know, we're here, bring it on.
[01:53:43.514 --> 01:53:46.978]  Because, you know, it gets into the whole question of Rapture or not and so on.
[01:53:47.118 --> 01:53:50.582]  But, as I said, watch out for those two things.
[01:53:50.642 --> 01:53:53.885]  The Earth Charter was endorsed, this final version, at UNESCO.
[01:53:54.205 --> 01:53:58.310]  We have recently, under Bush, rejoined UNESCO on October 1 of 2003.
[01:53:58.370 --> 01:54:00.392]  And that's supposedly conservative.
[01:54:00.832 --> 01:54:02.733]  I have to agree with Dr. Cuddy.
[01:54:02.753 --> 01:54:04.614]  I think behind all of this you have a spiritual blindness.
[01:54:04.634 --> 01:54:04.794]  Right.
[01:54:04.834 --> 01:54:05.434]  And you have people
[01:54:30.586 --> 01:54:49.952]  Right now, I'm in my fifties, but I think the kids are the contemporaries of my sixteen-year-old son, and they just don't question, and they just have no concept of... You know, it is a great delusion.
[01:54:50.012 --> 01:54:59.615]  It really is blindness, because you go ahead and the Bush administration official in front of thousands of people so they can torture children and crush their body parts in front of their parents, and they go, well, that's good, yeah.
[01:55:01.031 --> 01:55:23.882]  Go to the 501c subchapter 3 churches and pray for our leaders, but if you're going to pray for these people, pray that their consciences be reactivated, because that way either they become useless to their New World Order bosses, or they will harden their hearts and become reprobate and become a loose cannon, and again, either way,
[01:55:25.694 --> 01:55:26.554]  They're out of the picture.
[01:55:26.694 --> 01:55:33.358]  Well, Pete, you talk about a lot of blind people out there, figuratively, but aren't you seeing a lot of people that are also starting to wake up who wouldn't listen in the past?
[01:55:34.438 --> 01:55:38.060]  That's true, and I do pass out your videos and what have you.
[01:55:38.381 --> 01:55:40.942]  Sometimes I get positive results.
[01:55:42.583 --> 01:55:46.425]  The neocon types, of course, are the most difficult.
[01:55:46.605 --> 01:55:48.846]  I have a VHS.
[01:55:48.906 --> 01:55:51.528]  I want to get you something I captured off of CNN.
[01:55:52.666 --> 01:56:11.201]  uh... the other day yesterday as a matter of fact in the morning uh... where they talked about the dna database over in uh... great britain and it was that like a big joke they were laughing about how it was going to be used to uh... send ticket people or jail people caught spitting on the sidewalk.
[01:56:11.621 --> 01:56:15.744]  Oh I know, listen, they're talking about taking your house if you spit on the sidewalk now.
[01:56:16.025 --> 01:56:17.245]  Dr. Cuddy, have you heard about that?
[01:56:17.265 --> 01:56:21.569]  Where the most petty of things you go to jail for, they're like really hardcore crimes, they let you out?
[01:56:22.883 --> 01:56:32.810]  Yeah, I heard about that, and what you said, and what Nikola said about spiritual blindness and delusion and the choice, you know, if you wake up and so on, like you said Americans are.
[01:56:33.650 --> 01:56:35.992]  The globalists have that plan for that.
[01:56:36.092 --> 01:56:44.178]  Remember this mental health issue, where they redefine it, and if you have dogmatic... You're mentally ill, you think the government's bad!
[01:56:44.358 --> 01:56:47.921]  Yeah, if you talk about the new world order, you're paranoid, right?
[01:56:48.021 --> 01:56:50.543]  Paranoia is mental illness, and you need treatment.
[01:56:50.683 --> 01:56:51.063]  Remember,
[01:56:51.596 --> 01:56:53.437]  And you'll say, oh, they'll never get me for that.
[01:56:53.797 --> 01:57:08.505]  Well, remember Section 802 of the Patriot Act, which they've extended and they want to do permanently, says a domestic terrorist is someone who tries to coerce or intimidate any public official into changing public policy.
[01:57:08.865 --> 01:57:13.187]  So if you are for or against, let's say, gun control, abortion, whatever,
[01:57:13.587 --> 01:57:16.187]  And tell your legislator you're going to vote him out of office.
[01:57:16.528 --> 01:57:19.308]  If they don't do what you want, could that be domestic terrorism?
[01:57:19.328 --> 01:57:23.129]  Well, anybody that doubts that, I'll give you another five minutes, we've got Pastor Bush Falkerman on.
[01:57:23.549 --> 01:57:27.809]  Look at Philadelphia with the Christians praying, and they tried to give them 47 years of peace.
[01:57:27.829 --> 01:57:28.950]  I mean, they went to court, folks.
[01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:30.530]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:33.450]  We'll take one more call, and we'll let our guest go.
[01:57:34.591 --> 01:57:38.491]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.811 --> 01:57:39.632]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:51.270]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.930 --> 01:57:52.970]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.691 --> 01:57:54.811]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.451 --> 01:57:56.271]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.032 --> 01:57:57.932]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.592 --> 01:58:02.353]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.774 --> 01:58:06.835]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.936 --> 01:58:15.442]  I want to thank Dr. Dennis Cuddy for staying an extra five minutes with us.
[01:58:15.482 --> 01:58:17.584]  Pastor Butch Paul, my good friend, is coming up.
[01:58:18.084 --> 01:58:20.086]  Talk show host on the Genesis Network.
[01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:22.448]  He's a pastor, Vietnam veteran.
[01:58:23.569 --> 01:58:26.392]  He's a great guy from West Virginia.
[01:58:27.773 --> 01:58:30.235]  And I just always enjoy the fine work he does.
[01:58:30.295 --> 01:58:36.040]  He lives right there in the same neighborhood with our good friend, Hutton Gibson, who I also know listens to the show routinely.
[01:58:37.179 --> 01:58:41.222]  We're honored to have him as a listener tuning in today, hopefully.
[01:58:42.182 --> 01:58:45.324]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy, I want to take one final call from Al in California.
[01:58:45.344 --> 01:58:47.986]  Sorry to all the others, they've been holding along us.
[01:58:49.787 --> 01:58:56.592]  Just getting back to the New World Order here briefly, any other key points you want to briefly make that we haven't hit upon today?
[01:58:56.612 --> 01:58:59.594]  No, I've hit the main points.
[01:59:00.692 --> 01:59:07.714]  You know what I am seeing though that's good news at greater numbers than even just the general public per capita is people in the government.
[01:59:07.734 --> 01:59:19.458]  I mean there's a lot of prominent people coming out saying this is a new world order, they want to enslave us, they want to totally take over, there's an international elite controlling us.
[01:59:19.858 --> 01:59:26.120]  I mean there is a lot of people now that are talking about it and it's actually getting pretty chic to talk about this now.
[01:59:27.133 --> 01:59:53.953]  Yeah, it is, and as we've discussed in the past, if I could take 30 seconds to do this, since you mentioned Hutton Gibson, we've discussed using the documents like I've taken in the past, signed by FDR, Woodrow Wilson, Bill Clinton, and actually instead of having a movie like Conspiracy Theory, have one, Conspiracy, that's based on the documents and discover these documents to actually prove to the people that this isn't just a theory.
[01:59:53.973 --> 01:59:54.954]  That would be a good movie.
[01:59:56.659 --> 01:59:58.580]  Oh, like somebody trying to get the documents?
[01:59:59.261 --> 02:00:05.144]  Well, uh, let's say the hero and heroine, uh, Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts would find the letter by FDR, right?
[02:00:05.424 --> 02:00:06.705]  Saying, who really controls us?
[02:00:06.745 --> 02:00:14.949]  They find the letter by Woodrow Wilson, they find Cecil Rhodes' Secret Society, then they find the document Bill Clinton signed, a White House stationary supporting world government.
[02:00:15.029 --> 02:00:16.930]  And, you know, it would be a step-by-step discovery.
[02:00:16.991 --> 02:00:18.852]  And there's people chasing them while they do this.
[02:00:18.872 --> 02:00:19.292]  Right.
[02:00:19.392 --> 02:00:21.354]  And then at the end you go, go to this website.
[02:00:21.374 --> 02:00:22.535]  These are all public documents.
[02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:30.721]  Well, yeah, and not just a movie, but all over the world people would watch the thing simply to be able to download the documents.
[02:00:30.741 --> 02:00:37.847]  They could actually stop the movie on their computer, hit the print button, and have the letter from FDR in their hands, or Winston Churchill talking about the secret circle.
[02:00:38.928 --> 02:00:39.428]  Absolutely.
[02:00:39.468 --> 02:00:41.229]  Let's take a call from Allen, California.
[02:00:41.329 --> 02:00:41.910]  Al, go ahead.
[02:00:43.115 --> 02:00:44.096]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:00:44.536 --> 02:00:44.936]  Great!
[02:00:45.697 --> 02:00:58.324]  You know, I'm not exactly sure how to explain this, but I've brought this subject up before, and you quickly seem to knock people down on it and call it cop-out, cop-out.
[02:00:59.344 --> 02:01:01.666]  There's several principles.
[02:01:01.746 --> 02:01:04.467]  I'm just going to throw them out there for you.
[02:01:04.567 --> 02:01:12.332]  I really don't expect you to get it on the first try, and even if you do get it, I'm not sure if your heart is ready for it, because it's
[02:01:12.776 --> 02:01:17.800]  There's some things that are pretty complicated, and it's a matter of exercising real faith in God.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.102]  Okay, you've told me this is really heavy stuff.
[02:01:20.122 --> 02:01:20.982]  Go ahead and tell me.
[02:01:22.163 --> 02:01:28.788]  Well, if you recall back in times past that... Well, let me give two specific examples.
[02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:40.157]  When Assyria was attacking the Judaic part of Israel, and when Pharaoh was attacking the Egyptians that they were... Excuse me, not the Egyptians, the Israelites.
[02:01:40.417 --> 02:01:42.159]  Yes, I know, the pillar of fire, all that.
[02:01:42.970 --> 02:01:54.880]  Did you know that before those events, and also prophetically in Ezekiel, that before these events occurred, that God's people took up what appeared to be a weak position?
[02:01:56.814 --> 02:01:58.436]  You know what, I'm going to have to let my guest go.
[02:01:58.716 --> 02:02:04.401]  If you want to hold, we can go back to Pastor Butch later and have a theological discussion for a couple minutes.
[02:02:05.081 --> 02:02:06.803]  You say I can't handle this.
[02:02:06.883 --> 02:02:11.467]  I don't really understand what you're even talking about, but it's fine for you to finish up.
[02:02:11.767 --> 02:02:15.650]  Dr. Cuddy, I really want to thank you for joining us, and it's always great to have you on.
[02:02:16.511 --> 02:02:23.657]  Thank you, and if your caller looks at the Via Maris back in those times, whoever controlled world trade controlled the world in those biblical times.
[02:02:24.157 --> 02:02:29.678]  And that's what the globalists are doing today, to weaken all the nation states and make the international system preeminent.
[02:02:30.419 --> 02:02:32.679]  That's right, and we need to pray to God for help.
[02:02:33.179 --> 02:02:34.860]  Absolutely, that's a good solution there.
[02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:35.860]  Thank you, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:36.640]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:39.941]  If the caller wants to hold, he can talk to Pastor Bush when we get back.
[02:02:47.549 --> 02:02:50.391]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.651 --> 02:02:52.233]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.573 --> 02:02:57.236]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.597 --> 02:03:04.302]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.642 --> 02:03:06.623]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.844 --> 02:03:09.685]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.766 --> 02:03:14.429]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.649 --> 02:03:19.032]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:19.292 --> 02:03:26.497]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.757 --> 02:03:29.178]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:04:40.878 --> 02:04:48.482]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:04:48.542 --> 02:04:51.423]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:04:51.603 --> 02:04:57.006]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:04:57.226 --> 02:04:58.746]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:04:58.786 --> 02:05:01.047]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:04.829]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they seize?
[02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:07.110]  And they can do it without due process.
[02:05:07.190 --> 02:05:14.112]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[02:05:14.292 --> 02:05:20.014]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[02:05:20.274 --> 02:05:27.756]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property, or make it look like you own no property, and a whole lot more.
[02:05:27.796 --> 02:05:28.497]  We're good to go.
[02:05:46.943 --> 02:05:52.544]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.124 --> 02:05:57.265]  We got about 51 and a half minutes left of this live Wednesday edition.
[02:05:57.405 --> 02:06:02.286]  I want to mention a lot of different news items we haven't even covered yet and get Pastor Butch Paw's take on it.
[02:06:02.886 --> 02:06:12.428]  Butch is a great American, West Virginia, Vietnam veteran, running covert operations whenever he was in, I find it interesting, whenever he was in Cambodia, so he's lived a little bit.
[02:06:13.733 --> 02:06:18.637]  And he's been a pastor for several decades, been broadcasting, I don't know, 15 years.
[02:06:19.197 --> 02:06:24.361]  And he's been with Genesis, I guess, about 7 years or so, and we've been so honored to have him here with us.
[02:06:25.942 --> 02:06:30.846]  And he's a good old boy from West Virginia, and he knows how to read the Bible.
[02:06:30.926 --> 02:06:37.871]  And again, even if you're secular out there, this is interesting and informative for you, because for those that don't know, George Bush and the New World Order,
[02:06:39.053 --> 02:06:45.576]  And all their pimps said a hundred years ago they were going to take the churches over with the World Council of Churches and all these other organizations.
[02:06:45.636 --> 02:06:51.678]  And they teach whether it's Catholic churches in Chicago or Baptist churches here in Austin.
[02:06:51.718 --> 02:06:52.898]  I've seen the letters from both of them.
[02:06:53.379 --> 02:06:54.239]  Turn your guns in.
[02:06:54.299 --> 02:06:54.859]  It's good.
[02:06:54.939 --> 02:06:55.820]  Guns are bad.
[02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:57.540]  Do everything government says.
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:01.882]  Well then George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and all of them were evil.
[02:07:03.028 --> 02:07:05.409]  For standing up and not rendering unto Caesar.
[02:07:06.449 --> 02:07:09.731]  And I guess all the prophets were bad, being killed for not following orders.
[02:07:09.771 --> 02:07:11.031]  And I guess Paul was bad.
[02:07:11.091 --> 02:07:13.052]  I guess they were all just evil.
[02:07:13.072 --> 02:07:14.413]  And I guess we shouldn't have fought Hitler.
[02:07:15.173 --> 02:07:16.954]  Because I guess God sent Hitler to punish us.
[02:07:17.754 --> 02:07:22.096]  So, it's right there on the record that it's just pure propaganda.
[02:07:22.116 --> 02:07:23.256]  That's not what the Bible shows.
[02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:26.097]  So I've got him on about that today.
[02:07:26.117 --> 02:07:29.939]  And also to talk about how these churches are a bunch of whores.
[02:07:30.815 --> 02:07:33.617]  I'm not saying all of them, but I've been to a lot of churches around the country.
[02:07:33.797 --> 02:07:37.640]  It's just feel good, pray to God, you'll have a nice Cadillac.
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:39.481]  I've read a lot of the Bible.
[02:07:39.521 --> 02:07:44.064]  It's about standing up against evil, defending the weak, doing services.
[02:07:44.324 --> 02:07:45.625]  Faith without works is dead.
[02:07:45.645 --> 02:07:48.267]  And then people say, oh no, you don't have to do any works.
[02:07:48.307 --> 02:07:50.589]  Well folks, if you've got faith, you're going to be doing works.
[02:07:50.609 --> 02:07:53.310]  You're going to have an instinct to fight corruption.
[02:07:53.330 --> 02:07:56.993]  You're going to have an instinct to be ashamed of yourself when you do things that are wrong.
[02:07:57.566 --> 02:07:58.687]  Well, nobody's got to punish me.
[02:07:58.727 --> 02:08:00.147]  I punish myself when I do something wrong.
[02:08:00.187 --> 02:08:01.048]  I get very upset about it.
[02:08:01.108 --> 02:08:01.728]  I feel bad.
[02:08:02.228 --> 02:08:03.589]  But we've seared the conscience.
[02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:06.691]  Because the new order knows if you've got a conscience, you're not going to be a slave.
[02:08:07.051 --> 02:08:09.092]  Because being a slave is one of the greatest sins there is.
[02:08:09.292 --> 02:08:10.273]  But I'm not going to preach.
[02:08:10.993 --> 02:08:12.914]  Pastor Butch, it's good to have you up with us.
[02:08:13.714 --> 02:08:15.335]  Alex, it's always an honor to join you.
[02:08:15.415 --> 02:08:16.196]  And I really mean that.
[02:08:16.216 --> 02:08:18.057]  It's an honor to have you in my program from time to time.
[02:08:19.284 --> 02:08:23.425]  Great American exposing a lot of evil, and I am thankful that you're there for us.
[02:08:23.785 --> 02:08:26.266]  What do you say, Pastor, to people who say, hey, be positive.
[02:08:26.286 --> 02:08:28.627]  We're sick of hearing all the negative stuff on your show.
[02:08:29.067 --> 02:08:33.368]  Isn't it really positive to expose evil so that it doesn't happen to other people?
[02:08:33.428 --> 02:08:40.330]  I mean, isn't it really negative to just ignore what... I mean, let's say your leg's got gangrene, and you just think, oh, I'll think positively about it.
[02:08:40.370 --> 02:08:42.111]  I won't have it treated, and then you die.
[02:08:44.182 --> 02:08:47.243]  All my broadcasts, I've been on the air almost 13 years.
[02:08:47.303 --> 02:08:49.844]  All my broadcasts have always been done, of course, from a Christian perspective.
[02:08:50.164 --> 02:08:52.525]  I am a pastor, a preacher, have been for almost 30 years.
[02:08:53.546 --> 02:08:58.848]  And I cover current events as you do, not in details as you do, because your program is geared toward that, and you do a fine job of it.
[02:08:59.188 --> 02:09:00.989]  So I don't need to duplicate your program.
[02:09:01.289 --> 02:09:05.430]  But we do take on current issues and current events from a biblical perspective.
[02:09:06.131 --> 02:09:06.771]  And the only
[02:09:09.611 --> 02:09:13.575]  format left to this world, the only force left here to fight evil.
[02:09:13.655 --> 02:09:32.833]  Christ said, I left the church here to counter evil, to fight evil, and in my absence I gave you, he said in Acts chapter 1, the power of my presence of the Holy Spirit to stand in my stead, and power of attorney to speak in my name with authority to counteract evil of all matter, whether it be a
[02:09:34.013 --> 02:09:35.034]  We're good to go!
[02:09:52.037 --> 02:09:54.338]  Evil must not only be exposed, evil must be destroyed.
[02:09:55.419 --> 02:10:02.763]  If people would just read Psalms 149, you'll find we're told to go out with the lips of praise on our lips and a sword in our hand.
[02:10:03.264 --> 02:10:09.727]  And that's because we are, according to His Scripture, His battle axe in the world to deliver the innocent, to save the innocent.
[02:10:10.088 --> 02:10:16.752]  And the churches in America today as a whole, not all of them, and as a whole, they are 501c3 whore houses.
[02:10:16.772 --> 02:10:17.512]  They're not churches.
[02:10:17.972 --> 02:10:19.053]  Their head is not Christ.
[02:10:19.093 --> 02:10:20.614]  Their head is the IRS.
[02:10:21.035 --> 02:10:24.171]  They don't like to hear this Alex, but nonetheless that's what I preach, that's what I teach.
[02:10:24.764 --> 02:10:26.685]  And I will stand on that until the day I die.
[02:10:26.765 --> 02:10:32.087]  There is only one way of truth, and that is through Jesus Christ, Yeshua the Messiah, His Word and Truth.
[02:10:32.588 --> 02:10:33.908]  And history teaches truth.
[02:10:34.028 --> 02:10:38.290]  Our forefathers knew the truth of the power of the Gospel of Christ.
[02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:46.094]  As a matter of fact, Patrick Henry said this, and I get so sick of hearing people tell me, well, we were founded a multicultural society.
[02:10:46.414 --> 02:10:47.834]  That is not true at all.
[02:10:48.295 --> 02:10:51.276]  We were founded a Christian Republic.
[02:10:51.937 --> 02:11:01.700]  And Patrick Kennedy said it cannot be emphasized too often or too strongly that this great nation was founded not by religionists, but by Christians.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.621]  Not on religions, but on the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[02:11:05.661 --> 02:11:07.181]  Now that's pretty clear.
[02:11:07.581 --> 02:11:09.742]  Even for a hillbilly like me, I could figure that one out.
[02:11:10.162 --> 02:11:12.262]  We are not a nation of religions.
[02:11:12.302 --> 02:11:14.763]  We are a nation of one religion, Christianity.
[02:11:15.583 --> 02:11:16.885]  And laws are based upon that.
[02:11:17.365 --> 02:11:18.907]  Our whole society is based upon that.
[02:11:18.987 --> 02:11:24.073]  And for a long time it ran quite well on that premise of morality based upon Christ.
[02:11:24.554 --> 02:11:26.677]  Since we've lost that, we've lost all morality.
[02:11:26.717 --> 02:11:27.698]  The churches are corrupt.
[02:11:28.339 --> 02:11:31.643]  Needless to say, Caesar, the civil authority is beyond corrupt.
[02:11:32.083 --> 02:11:35.504]  And the world's going to hell because the church has lost its light.
[02:11:35.804 --> 02:11:36.985]  We are to be the light of the world.
[02:11:37.045 --> 02:11:41.427]  We're to be the backbone, if you will, of righteousness in this world.
[02:11:41.987 --> 02:11:49.349]  And I see very few pastors and preachers today that are worth their weight in salt.
[02:11:49.570 --> 02:11:50.510]  They're pulpit pimps.
[02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:51.270]  They're prostitutes.
[02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:56.032]  They're panty-waisted pimps behind a pulpit who will not preach the truth.
[02:11:56.462 --> 02:11:59.246]  They're afraid they might offend somebody.
[02:11:59.266 --> 02:12:03.351]  They're trying to build a church like Rick Warren's new books out.
[02:12:03.371 --> 02:12:04.773]  A purpose driven church.
[02:12:05.494 --> 02:12:06.475]  It's a business for them.
[02:12:06.695 --> 02:12:07.336]  How to make money.
[02:12:07.416 --> 02:12:08.117]  How to get numbers.
[02:12:08.672 --> 02:12:09.492]  I'm not into numbers.
[02:12:09.813 --> 02:12:11.413]  I'm into righteousness in Christ.
[02:12:11.453 --> 02:12:12.834]  And that's where the church has failed, Alex.
[02:12:13.194 --> 02:12:19.397]  Well, let's specifically, because for people out there, let's specifically... I mean, Hitler's favorite quote was Romans 13.
[02:12:19.537 --> 02:12:23.058]  Run around to Caesar and things that are Caesar and under God and things that are God.
[02:12:23.098 --> 02:12:26.840]  But the whole Bible is about fighting evil and standing up against corruption.
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:33.563]  I mean, but they take this one little thing out of context and they just try to beat us over the head with it.
[02:12:34.043 --> 02:12:42.266]  Well, I did a whole two-hour teaching on that topic, as you know, and I'll make available to anybody who wants one on DVD or VHS or audio or CD for $15.
[02:12:42.666 --> 02:12:48.088]  A two-hour teaching exposing the Renderer and Deceaser teaching that's been taught from the churches today.
[02:12:48.808 --> 02:12:56.091]  If they will only read the Scriptures in their entirety, they will find out that a righteous government is to be supported by the church.
[02:12:56.787 --> 02:13:10.660]  But when a civil authority oversteps his bounds and starts becoming immoral, then the church must oppose that tyrant, no matter what the cost, even if it means taking up physical arms to go to physical warfare.
[02:13:11.041 --> 02:13:14.524]  Because, Alex, maybe some people have trouble grasping this.
[02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:19.573]  But everything we see happening in the physical world comes from a spiritual force.
[02:13:19.954 --> 02:13:23.277]  For example, i.e., I pick up a gun and I commit murder.
[02:13:24.378 --> 02:13:25.539]  Did the gun commit the murder?
[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:26.100]  No.
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:28.002]  Did my hand commit the murder?
[02:13:28.202 --> 02:13:28.442]  No.
[02:13:28.802 --> 02:13:32.166]  Out of my heart, out of my spirit, comes that murder.
[02:13:32.446 --> 02:13:33.747]  Blaming the gun won't change it.
[02:13:34.168 --> 02:13:35.529]  Blaming my hand won't change it.
[02:13:35.871 --> 02:13:38.372]  But out of my spirit comes that act of murder.
[02:13:38.392 --> 02:13:48.235]  And on the other hand, someone breaks into your home that night to kill your family, and you pick up a weapon to defend yourself, out of a righteous heart comes a righteous stand to defend your family.
[02:13:48.455 --> 02:13:51.496]  Everything we see manifest in the flesh is of spiritual origin.
[02:13:51.796 --> 02:13:54.677]  When we finally understand that, then we understand the true idea.
[02:13:54.697 --> 02:13:55.477]  And here's an example.
[02:13:55.517 --> 02:14:02.399]  You feel bad about killing somebody in cold blood, but you would feel invigorated, and like you've done the right thing, killing some scumbag.
[02:14:02.935 --> 02:14:03.616]  Well, absolutely!
[02:14:04.316 --> 02:14:08.359]  No one is right-minded and wants to take another person's life.
[02:14:08.819 --> 02:14:14.003]  But believe me, and I don't care to say this on the radio, everywhere I go, I am armed.
[02:14:14.284 --> 02:14:15.144]  And I don't care who knows it.
[02:14:15.464 --> 02:14:22.550]  I say it on the radio, on my broadcast, I say it on your broadcast, I've written books about it, I've preached by Nepal, put the right to keep and bear arms, it's all biblical.
[02:14:22.570 --> 02:14:28.754]  If you don't believe me, read Nehemiah Chapter 4, read Numbers Chapter 1, where our forefathers got the idea of the militia.
[02:14:29.035 --> 02:14:30.696]  Numbers Chapter 1 is called the War Book.
[02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:34.999]  That's where our forefathers got the idea of Sevilla Militia, right out of the Scriptures.
[02:14:35.419 --> 02:14:38.661]  Luke 22, 36, Christ said, sell your coat and buy a sword.
[02:14:38.961 --> 02:14:42.324]  That wasn't for cleaning toenails, that was for self-protection.
[02:14:42.724 --> 02:14:56.333]  These things are so relevant and so obvious in the Scriptures, if people quit arguing with the Scriptures and believe them, we could change this country, the Church as a whole, the cause of the Church,
[02:14:56.873 --> 02:14:59.595]  Are more of a detriment to the cause of Christ than anything in Italian?
[02:14:59.675 --> 02:15:03.558]  Well, in China today, they have lots of churches, but they're government certified and approved.
[02:15:03.598 --> 02:15:05.259]  And that's all 501c3 is.
[02:15:05.299 --> 02:15:06.680]  That's exactly true.
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:08.821]  Since when did we need a permit to have a church?
[02:15:08.841 --> 02:15:09.802]  We never had it before.
[02:15:10.242 --> 02:15:12.043]  They just started saying, hey, sign this form.
[02:15:12.084 --> 02:15:13.104]  It's a new regulation.
[02:15:13.464 --> 02:15:21.550]  But the First Amendment says Congress can't make a law respecting the establishment of a church, of a religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[02:15:21.810 --> 02:15:28.212]  Up until 1954, under Lyndon Baines Johnson's leadership in the Senate, there was no 5063 clause in the IRS Code.
[02:15:28.592 --> 02:15:31.293]  We are automatically immune to taxation.
[02:15:31.333 --> 02:15:32.094]  No, we weren't exempt.
[02:15:32.334 --> 02:15:33.334]  The church is not exempt.
[02:15:33.514 --> 02:15:34.294]  We are immune.
[02:15:34.675 --> 02:15:37.776]  We have no authority over us but Jesus Christ our Lord.
[02:15:38.056 --> 02:15:41.257]  And anyone who has anything less than that is not serving Christ.
[02:15:41.657 --> 02:15:43.578]  And as I said, the churches are very, very
[02:15:44.518 --> 02:15:45.559]  Empty today.
[02:15:45.759 --> 02:15:58.668]  The men in the churches... Listen, I have a friend that goes to a big Baptist church here in town, and a couple of years ago during the election, they were given a sheet, he brought it to me, saying, don't talk about politics in the pews, don't talk about it at church lunch.
[02:15:58.968 --> 02:15:59.529]  Yes.
[02:15:59.729 --> 02:16:03.812]  I mean, it's not just the preacher doesn't talk about it now, it's you don't talk when you're here!
[02:16:04.032 --> 02:16:05.373]  Like it's the Soviet Union!
[02:16:05.573 --> 02:16:07.635]  Oh, we're the Soviet Union, you can't talk!
[02:16:07.915 --> 02:16:10.457]  Let me give you an example of just how bad it's gotten to be.
[02:16:11.037 --> 02:16:13.779]  Locally, there's a small Baptist church not too far from me,
[02:16:14.349 --> 02:16:19.351]  Who wanted to give a gentleman and his wife, his wife has cancer, wanted to give him a little bit of financial help.
[02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:20.772]  So they wrote him a check for $599.99.
[02:16:21.412 --> 02:16:24.013]  Now, that's an odd figure, is it not?
[02:16:24.673 --> 02:16:28.655]  So whenever they said that, I stopped and said, wait a minute now, why not $600?
[02:16:29.635 --> 02:16:30.235]  They can't.
[02:16:30.795 --> 02:16:37.898]  If they give more than $599.99, they must issue a $1099 to that person also, for income tax purposes.
[02:16:38.318 --> 02:16:42.120]  And now I said, well what if the Holy Spirit told you to give him $1000, what would you do then?
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:43.381]  Who do you obey?
[02:16:43.621 --> 02:16:49.445]  The IRS or the Holy Spirit, which is the presence of Christ in your heart.
[02:16:49.665 --> 02:16:52.247]  That church is not... the head is not Christ.
[02:16:52.888 --> 02:16:54.389]  They're not being led by the Holy Spirit.
[02:16:54.409 --> 02:16:55.690]  They're being led by the IRS.
[02:16:56.090 --> 02:17:04.176]  Every time someone comes into their church to sing or preach, and they give them a donation, they have to issue them a 1099 form for income tax purposes.
[02:17:04.476 --> 02:17:06.758]  That makes this place a business, not a church.
[02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:09.900]  Well, more than that now, when people come in to preach, they go, now here's the rules.
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:11.802]  You can't say anything if the government says so.
[02:17:12.677 --> 02:17:20.500]  Well, we were founded, and I know the seeds of evil were already here in 1776, but we were founded a Christian nation.
[02:17:21.081 --> 02:17:28.004]  The evil seeds are spread while the good has disappeared because of the church's apathy in England.
[02:17:28.844 --> 02:17:34.126]  Well, it's like the evil's been mass-producing and while good, you know, became a very rare animal indeed.
[02:17:34.927 --> 02:17:38.068]  Stay there, Butch, I want to get into these churches, I mean, because they just teach
[02:17:39.335 --> 02:17:40.416]  They're telling the world.
[02:17:41.117 --> 02:17:43.480]  It's like the Pope saying, in a one world order.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:44.461]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.431 --> 02:17:49.693]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:17:49.753 --> 02:17:53.956]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:17:54.196 --> 02:17:56.978]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:17:57.178 --> 02:17:59.580]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:08.405]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:08.605 --> 02:18:09.946]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:18:10.146 --> 02:18:14.309]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:15.409]  We're good to go!
[02:18:43.419 --> 02:18:45.080]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:52.286 --> 02:18:57.489]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:18:58.450 --> 02:19:11.560]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:19:12.441 --> 02:19:17.802]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[02:19:46.495 --> 02:19:50.177]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:19:50.577 --> 02:19:56.000]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:57.521]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:19:57.561 --> 02:20:01.563]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:20:02.263 --> 02:20:15.574]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[02:21:39.651 --> 02:21:55.534]  You know, I never claimed to be the best person, but ever since I was a little child, I couldn't stand corrupt people, bullies,
[02:21:57.673 --> 02:21:59.634]  Folks that like to push little guys around.
[02:21:59.654 --> 02:22:01.314]  I always enjoyed it.
[02:22:01.394 --> 02:22:04.575]  It actually became a bad thing as I started enjoying it.
[02:22:04.595 --> 02:22:05.995]  You know, beating up the bullies.
[02:22:06.855 --> 02:22:09.456]  But, I mean, today I get so angry.
[02:22:10.236 --> 02:22:11.137]  And I have to control it.
[02:22:11.257 --> 02:22:13.377]  And remember, I fight the New World Order because I love my family.
[02:22:13.417 --> 02:22:16.058]  But frankly, I also just, I get so angry.
[02:22:17.158 --> 02:22:18.458]  How they're scamming people.
[02:22:18.518 --> 02:22:19.499]  How they're conning them.
[02:22:19.519 --> 02:22:21.039]  The horrible things they do.
[02:22:22.461 --> 02:22:34.065]  And you know, my whole life, I mean, I grew up in a wealthy area with the richest county in Texas, so I mean, I was a poor boy from a middle class family compared to these people, you know, billionaires live in the area I lived in.
[02:22:34.946 --> 02:22:41.048]  And there was occultism everywhere, I mean, rich people into the occult, Satanists, it was everywhere.
[02:22:41.941 --> 02:22:45.464]  And then learning that the elite were into it.
[02:22:45.484 --> 02:22:47.225]  I mean, people heard my show eight years ago.
[02:22:47.245 --> 02:22:50.728]  I wasn't talking about skull and bones and order of death and New World Order.
[02:22:51.268 --> 02:22:55.552]  But I found out Hitler was into it, the Bushes are into it, the Rockefellers are into it.
[02:22:55.572 --> 02:22:59.575]  I mean, you can confirm that they really are devil worshippers.
[02:23:00.892 --> 02:23:02.793]  Butch, you talk about this being a spiritual battle.
[02:23:02.933 --> 02:23:03.593]  I know it is.
[02:23:03.733 --> 02:23:04.793]  I mean, I've experienced it.
[02:23:04.973 --> 02:23:06.934]  But even the people don't believe that.
[02:23:07.274 --> 02:23:08.975]  The elite does believe that.
[02:23:09.055 --> 02:23:10.935]  That is what's governing things.
[02:23:10.995 --> 02:23:13.656]  And what do you say to those that say, oh, it's not true, it's not happening?
[02:23:14.056 --> 02:23:18.297]  Or those that say, you're not supposed to get angry at this.
[02:23:18.357 --> 02:23:22.959]  I mean, is something wrong with me that I actually shake with anger sometimes?
[02:23:23.299 --> 02:23:27.280]  Well, the scriptures tell us that Christ became angry more than once with the corrupt church.
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:33.324]  He called the pharisees what they were, a bunch of white wars sepulchres or white wars tombs.
[02:23:33.624 --> 02:23:34.505]  He called them hypocrites.
[02:23:34.545 --> 02:23:35.405]  He called them vipers.
[02:23:35.425 --> 02:23:40.269]  He called Caesar, our word would be a skunk, he called him a
[02:23:42.719 --> 02:23:44.320]  I don't know if I'm saying the right word.
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.081]  He didn't call him.
[02:23:45.641 --> 02:23:46.322]  He said Fox.
[02:23:46.562 --> 02:23:47.743]  That's like calling him a skunk.
[02:23:48.143 --> 02:23:53.807]  He became angry more than once and he tells us in the scriptures that righteous people become angry over evil doers.
[02:23:55.088 --> 02:23:56.029]  It's impossible Alex.
[02:23:56.069 --> 02:23:59.251]  I wrote a little book entitled This Far No Further.
[02:23:59.784 --> 02:24:08.248]  And there's a quote that I put in there that goes to some effect that a righteous people cannot peacefully co-exist with evil.
[02:24:08.588 --> 02:24:09.309]  It's impossible.
[02:24:09.549 --> 02:24:11.830]  Can light co-exist with darkness?
[02:24:12.130 --> 02:24:12.870]  Is that possible?
[02:24:13.050 --> 02:24:13.931]  No, it's impossible.
[02:24:14.311 --> 02:24:15.812]  Can cold co-exist with heat?
[02:24:16.092 --> 02:24:16.852]  It's impossible.
[02:24:17.292 --> 02:24:18.193]  They're opposites.
[02:24:18.233 --> 02:24:19.533]  They cannot go together.
[02:24:19.593 --> 02:24:23.335]  And by the way, the evil people always say, oh, just let us have our ways.
[02:24:23.415 --> 02:24:24.376]  It's not really evil.
[02:24:24.396 --> 02:24:29.038]  But notice they're always trying to push their ways and always trying to outlaw what we do.
[02:24:30.109 --> 02:24:31.229]  Well, absolutely.
[02:24:31.269 --> 02:24:33.810]  That's because the church has become silent as a whole.
[02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:38.011]  Here in West Virginia, I am the spearhead, I guess, with people behind me.
[02:24:38.331 --> 02:24:42.013]  We are taking on the Department of Motor Vehicles, right now, over the National ID Card.
[02:24:42.033 --> 02:24:42.773]  We're not going to take it.
[02:24:42.833 --> 02:24:45.434]  We are going to take the Court of Amnesty to fight this in West Virginia.
[02:24:45.694 --> 02:24:46.794]  The Senate National President,
[02:24:48.087 --> 02:24:51.230]  And I shouldn't probably announce this on the air right now, but I'm going to in your program.
[02:24:52.231 --> 02:24:55.435]  Possibly, I'll be running for Governor this next election on the Constitutionalist Party.
[02:24:55.876 --> 02:24:56.817]  But that's beside the point.
[02:24:56.837 --> 02:25:02.543]  The point is, I am called out of the world to do battle against the world system.
[02:25:02.944 --> 02:25:07.129]  I am willing, more than willing, to obey a righteous government.
[02:25:07.694 --> 02:25:09.056]  We need government.
[02:25:09.677 --> 02:25:15.264]  The scriptures tell us in 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 9 that the law was given for the lawless, not for the righteous.
[02:25:15.304 --> 02:25:18.188]  So we need righteous laws to govern evil people.
[02:25:18.568 --> 02:25:23.034]  But I will not, I cannot, follow a tyrant
[02:25:23.396 --> 02:25:29.418]  Well, here's an example.
[02:25:29.458 --> 02:25:35.681]  We have a White House counsel who says they can torture people's children and crush their testicles in front of their parents.
[02:25:36.241 --> 02:25:43.764]  And he gets asked about it in front of a crowd of 2,000 students in Chicago, and he says, yes, the President can do that if he wants to.
[02:25:44.484 --> 02:25:52.270]  I mean, that is pure, open, Josef Mengele, Nazi evil that Wu is out promoting.
[02:25:52.290 --> 02:26:01.756]  And then meanwhile, when a state trooper pulls me over and gives me a ticket when I'm not even speeding because he doesn't know what he's doing, he's not himself an evil person, I would imagine.
[02:26:02.757 --> 02:26:04.818]  The government he's working for, the U.S.
[02:26:04.918 --> 02:26:05.958]  because it's federal, folks.
[02:26:05.998 --> 02:26:07.539]  State Police was set up by Roosevelt.
[02:26:07.559 --> 02:26:08.119]  They're all federal.
[02:26:08.139 --> 02:26:09.820]  Their own charters are actually federal.
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:15.722]  We have a government that's tested chemical and biological and radiologicals on us 3,000 plus times.
[02:26:16.202 --> 02:26:17.483]  Declassified in the 70s.
[02:26:17.523 --> 02:26:18.083]  Church hearings.
[02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:25.426]  We have a government that openly has engaged in mass kidnapping with Dying Corps and others.
[02:26:25.626 --> 02:26:26.226]  It's public!
[02:26:26.566 --> 02:26:31.048]  I mean, how does any part of the government have moral authority when the heads
[02:26:31.508 --> 02:26:38.404]  When the citadel leaders, when the governors of the New World Order are just pure pit of hell evil.
[02:26:39.051 --> 02:26:39.972]  Well, they don't.
[02:26:40.292 --> 02:26:44.534]  But you see, the problem is, neither does the current, what we'll call the church.
[02:26:44.614 --> 02:26:47.015]  I hate to use that word church to cover them all, but they're not.
[02:26:47.316 --> 02:26:49.217]  Because they're not churches, they're corporations.
[02:26:49.237 --> 02:26:51.518]  They have also lost their moral authority.
[02:26:51.878 --> 02:26:55.000]  People say, Pastor, how do you preach so straightforwardly?
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:26:56.801]  And I sense a power in what you say.
[02:26:57.101 --> 02:26:58.001]  It's not me, Alex.
[02:26:58.141 --> 02:26:58.862]  I'm only a servant.
[02:26:59.142 --> 02:27:02.724]  But inside me dwells the power of Almighty God, the Holy Ghost, the second glory of God.
[02:27:03.044 --> 02:27:10.632]  It speaks to me because I'm not 5-1-C-3, I'm not a member of the Whore, and I will not be, and I will die fighting the Whore, and exposing the evil!
[02:27:12.574 --> 02:27:18.160]  Well, when we come back, we'll take some calls, Al and others that are holding 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, and I want to throw out some news items for Butch to comment on as well.
[02:27:27.304 --> 02:27:28.724]  I want to get his take on Pat Robertson.
[02:27:28.744 --> 02:27:31.085]  Pat Robertson says taking a microchip's not bad.
[02:27:31.585 --> 02:27:33.826]  Face scanning to get a library book isn't bad.
[02:27:33.886 --> 02:27:35.147]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:37.607]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.047 --> 02:27:39.668]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.568 --> 02:27:43.349]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:49.791 --> 02:27:55.033]  Do you desire your health and vitality to be in harmony with the rhythms of nature?
[02:27:57.853 --> 02:28:06.220]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[02:28:06.881 --> 02:28:14.327]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[02:28:14.827 --> 02:28:16.609]  This is real, not science fiction.
[02:28:17.269 --> 02:28:25.917]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[02:28:28.413 --> 02:28:38.061]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas, such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[02:28:38.562 --> 02:28:42.485]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[02:28:45.828 --> 02:28:48.829]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:49.149 --> 02:28:54.071]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.331 --> 02:28:58.692]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.993 --> 02:29:07.896]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.096 --> 02:29:11.717]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:12.017 --> 02:29:17.040]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.341 --> 02:29:24.065]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.565 --> 02:29:25.106]  What about you?
[02:29:25.854 --> 02:29:31.197]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:29:31.257 --> 02:29:32.417]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:32.437 --> 02:29:34.318]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.013 --> 02:29:50.454]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:29:50.714 --> 02:29:54.295]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:29:54.455 --> 02:30:02.577]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:30:02.837 --> 02:30:08.458]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:30:08.778 --> 02:30:14.000]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:16.381]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[02:30:16.621 --> 02:30:28.765]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:30:29.005 --> 02:30:33.429]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:30:33.650 --> 02:30:34.590]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:34.791 --> 02:30:36.412]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:30:36.532 --> 02:30:38.314]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:30:38.574 --> 02:30:39.055]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:30:39.095 --> 02:30:39.275]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:31:06.713 --> 02:31:17.161]  We're about to go to your call.
[02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:26.469]  Pastor Butch, from your experience, and certainly a lot of patriots, a lot of people that love freedom and love decency and love goodness, have been persecuted throughout history.
[02:31:27.239 --> 02:31:38.530]  From all the numbers and the statistics and the common sense and my own experiences, I've found that when you really just commit 110% to something that's good, well it's like the old founder of the Texas Rangers had to say.
[02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:41.293]  Let me just read people the quote here.
[02:31:41.793 --> 02:31:47.379]  No man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow that's in the right and that keeps on a coming.
[02:31:47.679 --> 02:31:49.561]  Texas Ranger Captain Bill McDonald.
[02:31:51.083 --> 02:31:55.948]  But, I mean, that means standing up for what you believe in, not rationalizing and making excuses to yourself.
[02:31:56.368 --> 02:32:02.314]  But I've found that the people that go along with the system get fed on by it even more than the people that fight against it.
[02:32:02.334 --> 02:32:07.999]  You know, the scam is people think that going along with something actually keeps them safe.
[02:32:08.699 --> 02:32:14.381]  And in my experience, I found going along with something wrong just leads to stagnation and destruction.
[02:32:14.842 --> 02:32:17.063]  Well, might doesn't make right.
[02:32:17.323 --> 02:32:18.523]  Right makes might.
[02:32:18.623 --> 02:32:20.304]  A righteous man will not stop.
[02:32:20.644 --> 02:32:23.725]  He cannot stop because he's driven by a force greater than himself.
[02:32:24.105 --> 02:32:28.047]  By the way, Alex, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell the folks how they can contact me if they would like.
[02:32:28.087 --> 02:32:30.548]  Oh, and tell them about that Rendezvous to Caesar video.
[02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:30.728]  Yes.
[02:32:31.088 --> 02:32:33.089]  They can contact me by calling the toll-free number 800-777.
[02:32:36.924 --> 02:32:37.905]  4403.
[02:32:36.964 --> 02:32:37.905]  That's 800-777-4403.
[02:32:37.985 --> 02:32:43.647]  And they can order their end of season video for $15.
[02:32:43.848 --> 02:32:47.169]  Then go to my website, PastorButch.com.
[02:32:47.269 --> 02:32:47.849]  It's that simple.
[02:32:48.149 --> 02:32:50.110]  PastorButch.com.
[02:32:50.130 --> 02:32:52.451]  You're still doing Call to Decision, are you?
[02:32:52.591 --> 02:32:53.592]  Well, that's the same thing.
[02:32:53.612 --> 02:32:55.433]  Both of them go to the same link.
[02:32:55.973 --> 02:32:58.774]  PastorButch.com and CallToDecision.com are both the same.
[02:32:59.475 --> 02:33:01.175]  And also on shortwave every night on 5850.
[02:33:03.328 --> 02:33:04.471]  We're 7490.
[02:33:04.731 --> 02:33:09.943]  And that's from 8 to 9 central time also on a lot of different AM and FM stations around the country.
[02:33:09.963 --> 02:33:12.348]  Give folks that number again because rendering to Caesar is excellent.
[02:33:12.368 --> 02:33:12.408]  800-777-8888.
[02:33:15.024 --> 02:33:17.086]  4403.
[02:33:15.084 --> 02:33:17.086]  Call me when we're off the air.
[02:33:17.106 --> 02:33:18.607]  I'd be glad to talk to you about getting a copy of that.
[02:33:18.627 --> 02:33:20.629]  We'll use a credit card, or you can write to us.
[02:33:20.669 --> 02:33:24.332]  I'll give the address to you on the phone, if you like, on how to write and get it.
[02:33:24.753 --> 02:33:28.396]  Again, on the short way, 585-07490 until the 30th of June, and then we're going to 3.215 as our main frequency.
[02:33:28.436 --> 02:33:29.397]  But anyway, back to the topic.
[02:33:36.062 --> 02:33:39.745]  And I don't know how much plainer I can say this, and I am a simple man.
[02:33:40.366 --> 02:33:41.366]  I really, sincerely am.
[02:33:41.426 --> 02:33:42.367]  I'm a hillbilly.
[02:33:42.387 --> 02:33:44.029]  I was born and raised in a coal mining camp.
[02:33:44.429 --> 02:33:46.951]  I live down in a holler by myself here in the hills of West Virginia.
[02:33:47.571 --> 02:33:49.553]  We're alone in a very private area.
[02:33:49.593 --> 02:33:50.434]  I love it that way.
[02:33:51.134 --> 02:33:52.075]  I'm a simple person.
[02:33:52.115 --> 02:33:53.056]  I like simple things.
[02:33:53.596 --> 02:33:58.359]  But inside me there burns a fire of liberty and righteousness that I can't quench.
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:09.026]  In Jeremiah chapter 20, Jeremiah said, he said, I'm not going to preach anymore in the name of Jehovah Yahweh God because every time I do people mock me and laugh at me and make fun of me and want to kill me.
[02:34:09.246 --> 02:34:10.347]  But he said I can't quit.
[02:34:10.567 --> 02:34:12.308]  There's a fire in my bones that will consume me.
[02:34:12.708 --> 02:34:13.569]  That's how I am.
[02:34:13.789 --> 02:34:17.852]  There is something inside me that is a force of the Holy Ghost that I can't explain.
[02:34:17.932 --> 02:34:18.832]  Alex, I want to know.
[02:34:18.852 --> 02:34:20.954]  No, I experience the exact same thing.
[02:34:22.074 --> 02:34:22.795]  It can't be stopped.
[02:34:23.627 --> 02:34:32.991]  Well, I've also found that every time I get a death threat, or I've been physically attacked, or something bad happens, every time I seem to double what I'm doing.
[02:34:33.031 --> 02:34:34.012]  That's like saying sickle to a dog.
[02:34:34.052 --> 02:34:36.192]  And an incredible, you know, the comforter.
[02:34:36.212 --> 02:34:37.333]  I mean, it really does come.
[02:34:37.793 --> 02:34:39.674]  That's like saying sickle to a dog.
[02:34:40.114 --> 02:34:41.775]  I just want to hear that much harder.
[02:34:42.115 --> 02:34:44.656]  We have the most corrupt government in the history of the world.
[02:34:44.896 --> 02:34:51.159]  The United States of America is the most corrupt government in the history of the world, bar none.
[02:34:51.639 --> 02:34:52.900]  We have slave trade.
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:54.301]  We murder our babies.
[02:34:54.561 --> 02:34:56.662]  We're bombing the world to oblivion for the New World Order.
[02:34:57.022 --> 02:34:58.483]  We are the most corrupt government yet.
[02:34:58.523 --> 02:35:02.285]  Yet, at one time, we had the most righteous government in the world's history.
[02:35:02.585 --> 02:35:04.306]  And now we, by the way, I can prove this too.
[02:35:04.346 --> 02:35:05.607]  I did a three-hour teaching on this.
[02:35:06.027 --> 02:35:08.088]  We are the end-time Babylon.
[02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.949]  This is biblical.
[02:35:08.969 --> 02:35:10.670]  I can prove it by hundreds of scriptures.
[02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:16.013]  We were once a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, and now we are a cup of bitterness in His hand.
[02:35:16.393 --> 02:35:19.035]  We had everything that the world would desire.
[02:35:19.355 --> 02:35:22.697]  A Christian nation, power, prosperity.
[02:35:22.777 --> 02:35:27.320]  We threw it all away for materialism.
[02:35:27.882 --> 02:35:29.403]  And a lack of concern.
[02:35:29.743 --> 02:35:33.205]  The churches have become very materialistic and very puny.
[02:35:33.385 --> 02:35:33.966]  They have no power.
[02:35:33.986 --> 02:35:34.206]  No, I know.
[02:35:34.226 --> 02:35:37.287]  I watch TV and all they do is gibber about how to make money.
[02:35:37.588 --> 02:35:37.928]  Oh, yes.
[02:35:37.988 --> 02:35:39.128]  They really like voodoo.
[02:35:39.449 --> 02:35:40.109]  They've been claiming.
[02:35:40.149 --> 02:35:40.569]  Pat Robertson.
[02:35:40.589 --> 02:35:41.430]  You mentioned Pat Robertson.
[02:35:41.470 --> 02:35:44.632]  Pat Robertson is a fraud.
[02:35:44.832 --> 02:35:45.752]  And I'm saying it very clearly.
[02:35:46.052 --> 02:35:46.733]  A fraud.
[02:35:46.993 --> 02:35:51.596]  The man owns and bought diamond mines in Africa with people's money.
[02:35:53.116 --> 02:35:54.857]  Where they machine gunned and killed a bunch of people.
[02:35:54.897 --> 02:35:55.198]  Yes.
[02:35:55.278 --> 02:35:57.259]  He bought a race horse named Mr. Pat.
[02:35:57.819 --> 02:35:59.020]  And a race horse now.
[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:01.463]  Now listen, I have nothing against a preacher and a good horse.
[02:36:01.823 --> 02:36:03.405]  I used to have one myself years ago.
[02:36:04.366 --> 02:36:05.927]  Spend two or three thousand dollars on a good horse?
[02:36:06.007 --> 02:36:06.388]  Fine.
[02:36:06.468 --> 02:36:06.748]  Do it.
[02:36:07.088 --> 02:36:09.431]  But he bought a race horse for half a million dollars.
[02:36:09.711 --> 02:36:12.534]  He had another one that he took out the stud for a hundred thousand dollars.
[02:36:12.834 --> 02:36:13.514]  Come on, folks.
[02:36:13.614 --> 02:36:17.455]  Is this what you're supposed to do with the money that Christ gives you to further the gospel?
[02:36:17.495 --> 02:36:18.676]  Pat Roberts is a big hit on Fox.
[02:36:18.696 --> 02:36:19.696]  Well, forget all that.
[02:36:19.776 --> 02:36:24.397]  He said on CNN that China's forced abortion and fanaticide is what they've got to do.
[02:36:24.677 --> 02:36:26.778]  He also said taking the chip is not evil.
[02:36:27.038 --> 02:36:28.138]  Facial scan is not evil.
[02:36:28.178 --> 02:36:30.619]  These people are killing this nation.
[02:36:31.562 --> 02:36:38.650]  Well, I played the clip a few weeks ago where he actually said, Oh, get used to Big Brother.
[02:36:38.690 --> 02:36:39.651]  It's good for you.
[02:36:39.731 --> 02:36:40.572]  It's not a problem.
[02:36:40.612 --> 02:36:43.836]  And the kids having the thumb scan to check their books out is no big deal.
[02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:49.351]  Well, that's because he is a 501c3 corporate whore.
[02:36:49.672 --> 02:36:51.613]  That man's a multi-millionaire, Alex.
[02:36:51.853 --> 02:36:53.674]  And he did it because... Multi-millionaire?
[02:36:53.695 --> 02:36:55.936]  Yeah, he was one time on like 30 cable channels.
[02:36:55.956 --> 02:36:56.717]  Absolutely.
[02:36:56.777 --> 02:37:02.441]  He is a multi-millionaire, along with a lot of others, I said, like Benny Hinn and Kenneth Copeland and a bunch of them.
[02:37:02.461 --> 02:37:04.282]  And I'm walking on toes and I don't care.
[02:37:04.682 --> 02:37:09.186]  I have it on video, Billy Graham saying that you don't have to know Christ to be a Christian.
[02:37:09.546 --> 02:37:10.707]  I have all this on video.
[02:37:10.767 --> 02:37:11.487]  I'm not making it up.
[02:37:11.587 --> 02:37:12.488]  I wouldn't lie about this.
[02:37:13.075 --> 02:37:14.796]  I can prove what I say or I wouldn't say it.
[02:37:15.177 --> 02:37:18.239]  These people are frauds and they're millionaires because of frauds.
[02:37:18.559 --> 02:37:21.981]  Satan pays his people well on earth temporarily.
[02:37:22.302 --> 02:37:23.763]  Sin has plagued it for a season.
[02:37:24.083 --> 02:37:26.124]  But payday is coming for all of us one day, Alex.
[02:37:26.525 --> 02:37:31.308]  One day, we're going to stand before a Supreme Being that our Supreme Court cannot save us from.
[02:37:31.568 --> 02:37:32.429]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:37:33.329 --> 02:37:35.311]  I mean, we're being judged by our evil actions.
[02:37:35.331 --> 02:37:38.173]  You know, all throughout the Bible and history and common sense shows
[02:37:39.235 --> 02:37:45.238]  That if you let an evil government get into place and do whatever it wants, you're going to get hurt, or those that you love are going to be hurt by it, at the bare minimum.
[02:37:45.438 --> 02:37:48.539]  And we get judged in this life, too, by what we do.
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:52.641]  Nations are judged in the here and now, and so are individuals to a point.
[02:37:52.941 --> 02:37:54.942]  But all nations are judged in the here and now.
[02:37:55.002 --> 02:37:56.463]  Not in the hereafter, but here and now.
[02:37:56.863 --> 02:38:00.105]  Thomas Jefferson said this back in the 1800s.
[02:38:00.145 --> 02:38:05.187]  He said, the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots
[02:38:06.307 --> 02:38:08.950]  It's just natural manure, and there's nothing wrong with that.
[02:38:09.651 --> 02:38:11.052]  That is the price of liberty.
[02:38:11.833 --> 02:38:12.294]  It's blood.
[02:38:12.314 --> 02:38:13.094]  It's paid for in blood.
[02:38:13.495 --> 02:38:14.796]  Christ paid for it in His blood.
[02:38:15.077 --> 02:38:17.159]  He said, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[02:38:17.659 --> 02:38:22.245]  And you know, these people that say, name it and claim it and don't worry about anything, we're all going to be raptured out.
[02:38:22.625 --> 02:38:26.890]  Christ talked about how we'll be persecuted, and that's how we're sanctified.
[02:38:27.410 --> 02:38:29.012]  But no, not according to them.
[02:38:29.192 --> 02:38:32.995]  You're supposed to get millions of dollars and just everybody loves you.
[02:38:33.015 --> 02:38:38.000]  It says, all those that shall live godly in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted.
[02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:39.181]  That's pretty clear.
[02:38:39.461 --> 02:38:42.364]  He said, if you love me, the world's going to hate you.
[02:38:42.404 --> 02:38:44.466]  So if the world loves you, you're none of mine, he said.
[02:38:44.946 --> 02:38:46.548]  These are his words, not mine.
[02:38:46.648 --> 02:38:49.430]  And I'm going to preach them just like it says it.
[02:38:49.651 --> 02:38:52.053]  And we have, right now in the White House,
[02:38:52.553 --> 02:39:06.292]  Well, I mean, I can't believe that they're actually coming out and saying, we torture children, and we're allowed to crush their private parts off, and the President's allowed to do that.
[02:39:06.312 --> 02:39:09.276]  I mean, that's just, they should all be arrested instantly.
[02:39:10.666 --> 02:39:13.027]  Well, where is the cry of righteous indignation?
[02:39:13.467 --> 02:39:14.067]  Righteous?
[02:39:14.127 --> 02:39:15.727]  I mean, how common sense is it?
[02:39:16.047 --> 02:39:19.368]  I mean, torturing people is bad, but my gosh, torturing little kids?
[02:39:19.428 --> 02:39:21.269]  I mean, that's Jeffrey Dahmer!
[02:39:21.569 --> 02:39:25.930]  I mean, we murder 4,000 babies a day, tear them apart in a moment, put them in a trash can.
[02:39:26.350 --> 02:39:29.691]  So what's the difference between the ones we can see and the ones we can't see?
[02:39:29.711 --> 02:39:30.391]  There is no difference.
[02:39:30.411 --> 02:39:32.892]  A man's conscience has become seared to evil.
[02:39:33.132 --> 02:39:38.773]  And the churches are the biggest party to that, because they no longer speak forth righteousness.
[02:39:39.193 --> 02:39:41.034]  George Bush is a piece of scum.
[02:39:41.374 --> 02:39:44.955]  He either took out the nearest tree and hung, and I'd be glad to furnish the rope or pour the rope.
[02:39:45.215 --> 02:39:46.076]  I'm not ashamed to say that.
[02:39:46.116 --> 02:39:46.996]  He's a tyrant.
[02:39:47.696 --> 02:39:50.437]  He's a Luciferian.
[02:39:50.797 --> 02:39:58.560]  These people, and Pat Robertson's another one, should be took out and hung from the highest tree for treason, and not only against our nation, but against the Almighty God.
[02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:00.261]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:40:00.621 --> 02:40:04.242]  Paul Craig Roberts, number two Treasury Department for Ronald Reagan,
[02:40:05.759 --> 02:40:09.762]  You said the exact same thing, basically, about two months ago.
[02:40:09.782 --> 02:40:11.183]  A lot of other people are saying that.
[02:40:11.223 --> 02:40:11.864]  I'll say this.
[02:40:12.264 --> 02:40:20.790]  All the criminals of the New World Order would need to be tried by a jury and due process, and then they need to be punished for their criminal activities.
[02:40:21.491 --> 02:40:24.353]  And, you know, again, we see mass evil.
[02:40:24.453 --> 02:40:27.355]  Either people are getting more and more evil, or they're getting more and more awake.
[02:40:27.375 --> 02:40:27.976]  That's right.
[02:40:27.996 --> 02:40:30.017]  I do see a lot of people waking up, though, Pastor.
[02:40:30.458 --> 02:40:31.839]  Well, there are more coming along.
[02:40:31.959 --> 02:40:33.560]  I just pray it's enough past enough.
[02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:42.706]  You know, during the revolution, the 1600s, 1700s, the light of the revolution was the pulpits of the churches.
[02:40:42.786 --> 02:40:44.347]  They were aflame with righteousness.
[02:40:45.508 --> 02:41:00.918]  The power behind the revolution were the sermons preached by Peter Gilbert Muehlenberg and Jonas Clark and many others, who led the battles of the war for liberty, who said that we cannot tolerate this, to deny, to let King George or any other tyrant
[02:41:02.055 --> 02:41:02.716]  If we as a Christian
[02:41:12.375 --> 02:41:14.556]  Continue to go down the road of tyranny.
[02:41:14.937 --> 02:41:19.519]  We will go to hell for accepting the final Embark the Beast scenario.
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:21.040]  And folks, it's upon us right now.
[02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:22.821]  The National ID Card becomes law in 2008.
[02:41:24.042 --> 02:41:25.323]  Your states are going to enforce it.
[02:41:25.703 --> 02:41:26.664]  Our states won the first.
[02:41:26.684 --> 02:41:27.644]  We're going to fight it here in this state.
[02:41:27.664 --> 02:41:29.265]  You're going to have to have it to do anything.
[02:41:29.926 --> 02:41:32.607]  Let's take some calls before we run out of time here.
[02:41:33.388 --> 02:41:40.072]  I do want to point out, though, George Bush is really just a puppet in my big geopolitical calculation board here.
[02:41:40.732 --> 02:41:45.974]  They would actually get a lot of gas mileage out of their puppets and their minions falling by the wayside.
[02:41:46.034 --> 02:41:55.839]  So just in a purely cold political calculation, I would like to see Lord Rothschild out of London, England go to prison or be tried for his crimes and punished.
[02:41:56.179 --> 02:41:58.520]  I'd like to see David Rockefeller for all of his crimes.
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:05.821]  I would really like to even go past the puppets and then see due process there and make sure that was dealt with.
[02:42:06.101 --> 02:42:09.402]  Now, Al, try to make it quick because I've got a load of phone lines for the whole show.
[02:42:10.002 --> 02:42:24.745]  Al earlier called in and he was saying something about how God's people are supposed to take this passive weak position and I ran up against a break so I said, hold Al and if he's still there we'll let him come up and ask his question or make his comment.
[02:42:25.045 --> 02:42:25.545]  Al, go ahead.
[02:42:26.707 --> 02:42:30.729]  Well, I'm still here, and I think it's going to take quite some time.
[02:42:30.889 --> 02:42:34.451]  Well, no, I understand this is such a big, lofty thing you're going to tell us.
[02:42:34.471 --> 02:42:38.533]  You get to tell us that, but you already said about five times earlier, this is really big and lofty.
[02:42:38.753 --> 02:42:40.334]  Just boil down your argument for us.
[02:42:41.194 --> 02:42:43.055]  Well, let's put it this way.
[02:42:43.175 --> 02:42:52.100]  Some things in the Bible, they apply to certain people at certain times in history, and other things don't apply to them at that time in history.
[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:54.061]  And even in the times in history where
[02:42:55.121 --> 02:42:57.863]  I don't even know what you're going to say, but let me just guess.
[02:42:57.923 --> 02:42:59.084]  We should lay down to the government.
[02:42:59.564 --> 02:43:08.149]  Specifically, in the Christian Greek scriptures, in the Hebrew scriptures, it says that we should not bear arms anymore.
[02:43:08.810 --> 02:43:10.531]  No, no, no, sir.
[02:43:10.551 --> 02:43:12.512]  That is not in your Bible anywhere.
[02:43:12.952 --> 02:43:15.754]  Read Luke 22, 36 to me out loud, what Christ said.
[02:43:16.334 --> 02:43:17.895]  That is not scriptural at all.
[02:43:18.035 --> 02:43:18.916]  Not at all.
[02:43:18.956 --> 02:43:20.497]  He says in that context that
[02:43:21.604 --> 02:43:31.970]  This is before, just before the time when he was about to go in the Garden of Gethsemane and Peter took the sword and sliced off the guy's ear.
[02:43:32.010 --> 02:43:38.795]  So, in that context, Peter just said previously, you'll need to take the sword with you.
[02:43:39.195 --> 02:43:42.757]  So, hold on, it was wrong to fight Hitler?
[02:43:43.698 --> 02:43:47.380]  No, the question is... Was it wrong to fight against King George?
[02:43:48.226 --> 02:44:01.222]  Well, if these Christians in these nations had supposedly been following their Christian way of life, no one in the military would have ever joined the military and no- That's a delusional thing, listen- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
[02:44:02.098 --> 02:44:02.899]  Wait a minute, sir.
[02:44:02.959 --> 02:44:03.639]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:03.659 --> 02:44:05.180]  You don't have anything.
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:06.301]  There's nothing there.
[02:44:06.361 --> 02:44:07.741]  This man is totally out of it.
[02:44:07.822 --> 02:44:11.464]  Imagine if he was a father and had kids.
[02:44:11.504 --> 02:44:12.324]  I should have kept him on.
[02:44:12.884 --> 02:44:17.007]  He's just going to let some pig come in and rape and kill his family and not love him?
[02:44:17.347 --> 02:44:21.930]  I have had people like him tell me, well, what I'll do is I'll fall down on my knees and pray while they rape my wife.
[02:44:22.210 --> 02:44:23.350]  What a piece of scum!
[02:44:23.631 --> 02:44:24.371]  He'll be taken out and hung.
[02:44:24.391 --> 02:44:24.551]  Go ahead.
[02:44:24.571 --> 02:44:24.891]  Go ahead.
[02:44:26.792 --> 02:44:29.054]  Well, I mean, it's just, it's just, it's not true!
[02:44:29.174 --> 02:44:30.575]  It's not true!
[02:44:30.595 --> 02:44:35.559]  The whole Bible is people not minding the government and being killed for it, or taking the government over.
[02:44:35.579 --> 02:44:40.303]  The Scripture tells me that I must provide for my own, or I did not deny the face of worst infidel.
[02:44:40.563 --> 02:44:45.407]  The 1828... Well, what are the Scriptures about if your enemy comes into your home, rise up and kill him quickly?
[02:44:45.947 --> 02:44:46.547]  It's total cowardice!
[02:45:07.236 --> 02:45:15.103]  It's just so they can run around with limp wrists and go, ehhh, ehhh, and never stand up against anything, never get shoved around, never get in a fight.
[02:45:15.543 --> 02:45:16.805]  I just cannot believe it.
[02:45:17.845 --> 02:45:21.949]  That kind of teaching makes me... But I mean, did you just hear the weakness, though?
[02:45:22.209 --> 02:45:22.590]  Oh, yes, I did.
[02:45:22.610 --> 02:45:23.370]  I mean, you could just tell.
[02:45:23.390 --> 02:45:24.691]  It was pure weakness.
[02:45:24.711 --> 02:45:27.634]  That was satanic power, the weakness of trying to come through.
[02:45:27.654 --> 02:45:28.515]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:45:28.535 --> 02:45:30.777]  That's Carl Jones, too, Alex.
[02:45:32.038 --> 02:45:32.919]  Man, what do you say to that?
[02:45:32.999 --> 02:45:34.200]  Chris and Mass, go ahead.
[02:45:36.654 --> 02:45:37.795]  Go ahead, Chris, you're on the air.
[02:45:37.995 --> 02:45:46.060]  Oh, hey, yeah, thanks a lot for just telling everyone straight up that it is a battle between good and evil, and God damn, what the hell are we gonna do?
[02:45:47.657 --> 02:45:51.019]  Well, you know, I don't know what we're going to do here.
[02:45:51.239 --> 02:45:54.281]  I just know that I'm not going to miss the forest for the trees.
[02:45:55.182 --> 02:45:57.963]  And, you know, we should try to be respectful to God.
[02:45:58.003 --> 02:45:58.544]  I know that.
[02:45:59.024 --> 02:46:00.125]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:46:00.145 --> 02:46:01.025]  But what do we do?
[02:46:01.085 --> 02:46:03.206]  We learn to find our backbones again.
[02:46:03.226 --> 02:46:09.150]  I mean, I learned this real quick when I was like 12 years old and four guys were around me beating me up for no reason walking home from school.
[02:46:09.550 --> 02:46:12.152]  And I learned the next time it was a lot easier just to start fighting them.
[02:46:12.792 --> 02:46:20.181]  And, you know, if four guys jump on you and pick up a rock next time, and when you crush somebody's skull in, they're not going to come at you next time or beat up the next ten people.
[02:46:20.701 --> 02:46:26.848]  I mean, it's just... And Paul told Timothy in the Scriptures to put on the whole armor of God.
[02:46:26.868 --> 02:46:30.372]  Now read it for yourself, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:30.805 --> 02:46:31.646]  To be a warrior.
[02:46:31.686 --> 02:46:33.288]  That doesn't mean just spiritual warrior.
[02:46:33.528 --> 02:46:35.029]  We're trained to be warriors.
[02:46:35.270 --> 02:46:36.791]  And a warrior is trained to fight.
[02:46:36.831 --> 02:46:39.234]  And a warrior who's not in battle is not a happy warrior.
[02:46:39.534 --> 02:46:42.617]  So please, y'all that don't believe in fighting and doing what's right.
[02:46:42.837 --> 02:46:48.043]  Well, listen to the circular logic that we heard from the individual earlier.
[02:46:48.083 --> 02:46:50.185]  And Alan, you can call back in tomorrow or something if you want.
[02:46:50.225 --> 02:46:51.566]  I didn't mean to cut you off or be mean.
[02:46:51.827 --> 02:46:52.928]  I don't know what your problem is.
[02:46:53.548 --> 02:46:59.231]  But, oh, so the men wouldn't have joined the British military if their king wasn't Christian.
[02:46:59.511 --> 02:46:59.791]  Well, wait.
[02:46:59.971 --> 02:47:01.772]  So now you've got to decide who was Christian.
[02:47:02.032 --> 02:47:03.693]  Was it the king or was it America?
[02:47:03.933 --> 02:47:06.074]  I mean, he was actually saying America was bad.
[02:47:06.594 --> 02:47:07.314]  Yes, that's right.
[02:47:07.955 --> 02:47:08.175]  Yes.
[02:47:09.455 --> 02:47:13.257]  I mean, it's just... And then I said, so we shouldn't have fought Hitler.
[02:47:13.857 --> 02:47:15.138]  Or we shouldn't have fought anybody.
[02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:16.999]  I mean, where does this come from?
[02:47:17.745 --> 02:47:28.197]  It comes from the pits of hell and the pastorism that's been taught from the churches today because he probably belongs to a 501c3 Baptist church who wouldn't stand for anything unless it's a free lunch.
[02:47:28.938 --> 02:47:29.499]  Go ahead Alex.
[02:47:30.476 --> 02:47:39.079]  Well, I mean, you know, oh, let's follow the orders of the black ski mask cops with 25-inch arms with giant skull tattoos all over them.
[02:47:39.459 --> 02:47:42.340]  Oh, let's turn our guns in so they can have our way with us.
[02:47:42.900 --> 02:47:50.162]  Yeah, let's let them sodomize their sons, rape their daughters, take their wives off and cut off their breasts and laugh at them.
[02:47:50.182 --> 02:47:51.382]  Now, folks, you've got to make this up.
[02:47:51.682 --> 02:47:52.623]  They've done this all over the world.
[02:47:52.643 --> 02:47:54.083]  Go right now and try it in other places.
[02:47:54.463 --> 02:47:57.084]  They'll take a pregnant woman, tie her to a tree, set her up in a womb,
[02:47:57.344 --> 02:47:58.145]  Watch a baby fall.
[02:47:58.165 --> 02:48:00.226]  I stomped a baby in front of her and didn't kill her.
[02:48:00.246 --> 02:48:04.228]  Now that's what a Christian should tolerate and sit back and say, well, I'll pray about it.
[02:48:04.308 --> 02:48:05.409]  You bunch of hypocrites.
[02:48:05.469 --> 02:48:08.190]  Bunch of just trash scum.
[02:48:08.811 --> 02:48:09.811]  I mean, scum.
[02:48:09.851 --> 02:48:10.852]  I mean, exactly.
[02:48:11.632 --> 02:48:14.694]  You know, I mean, just ten years ago we complained about a massacre in China.
[02:48:14.734 --> 02:48:15.835]  Now that's not even in the news.
[02:48:16.175 --> 02:48:17.636]  Oh, they mowed down a couple villages.
[02:48:17.776 --> 02:48:18.537]  Ah, so what?
[02:48:18.917 --> 02:48:20.117]  Ah, the Lord's coming soon.
[02:48:20.157 --> 02:48:20.998]  We'll be all right.
[02:48:21.138 --> 02:48:22.259]  Just wait for the raft shovel.
[02:48:22.339 --> 02:48:23.519]  Once saved, all you say, don't worry about it.
[02:48:23.539 --> 02:48:24.700]  Live like hell and go to heaven.
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:25.861]  I know what they say.
[02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:29.111]  And I'll tell ya, it's... You got me fired up, Alex!
[02:48:31.692 --> 02:48:33.253]  Well, that guy got me fired up.
[02:48:33.333 --> 02:48:38.515]  I just... It's just a... Just a... But we have to lay down.

[02:52:11.807 --> 02:52:13.308]  That's not freedom, that's not America.

[02:52:39.077 --> 02:52:43.199]  I mean, if you're not supposed to do anything, then why were we commanded to stand up against evil?
[02:52:43.559 --> 02:52:47.041]  Commanded... And the same people that whine and go, don't physically fight.
[02:52:47.668 --> 02:52:51.651]  Well, they're the same ones that never go out and protest or never go out and do anything.
[02:52:51.971 --> 02:52:53.052]  They never do anything!
[02:52:53.672 --> 02:52:56.194]  And folks, I hope you'll go to Infowars.com and do something.

[02:53:18.521 --> 02:53:29.088]  You know, Butch, I think a lot of it is some of these people, and I'm sure you look a lot more than I am, I mean, you know, in the military and doing special ops in Vietnam and being a preacher for 30 years and a grandpa now.
[02:53:29.388 --> 02:53:34.151]  I'm a father, you know, I've seen a lot of stuff myself, nothing compared to a lot of people, but I know the world's a rough place.
[02:53:34.191 --> 02:53:35.172]  I know it isn't a joke.
[02:53:35.672 --> 02:53:41.777]  And I know that God smiles on those that, you know, there's an old Bedouin saying, trust in God but tie up your camel.
[02:53:42.298 --> 02:53:44.520]  You know, I mean, God helps those that help themselves.
[02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:45.801]  And I just don't know what to say.
[02:53:48.127 --> 02:53:49.428]  Spread the truth like you've been doing.

[02:53:53.774 --> 02:53:58.880]  We put out a monthly news magazine that's huge with current events and issues.
[02:53:58.901 --> 02:54:00.242]  The website's good, too.
[02:54:00.603 --> 02:54:01.604]  PastorButch.com.
[02:54:01.624 --> 02:54:03.266]  We'll take you right to CallToDecision.com.
[02:54:03.286 --> 02:54:04.047]  The same website.
[02:54:04.327 --> 02:54:05.289]  That's the best place.
[02:54:06.010 --> 02:54:06.290]  Pardon?
[02:54:06.471 --> 02:54:08.012]  That's the best place to go, is the website.
[02:54:08.172 --> 02:54:08.913]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:54:09.233 --> 02:54:10.714]  Patchabish.com is the website.
[02:54:10.755 --> 02:54:11.735]  Call us at decision.com.
[02:54:12.016 --> 02:54:13.057]  It's all the same website.
[02:54:13.397 --> 02:54:18.642]  And we also make available to you, we did a seminar last June, Exposing the Beast Seminar.
[02:54:18.682 --> 02:54:25.949]  Some of the best speakers available, David Joyce von Kleist, Colonel Craig Roberts, Joan Beyond, Dr. Bill Deagle, myself.
[02:54:26.609 --> 02:54:29.251]  We're all in there talking about what's going on in the country and the world today.
[02:54:29.572 --> 02:54:33.935]  Folks, please, for the glory of Christ and for the sake of your children, get in the face of evil.
[02:54:34.375 --> 02:54:41.921]  Win or lose in this world, we're going to answer one day to a righteous God who's going to determine our eternal destiny.
[02:54:42.322 --> 02:54:45.684]  Not by what we thought, but how much we obeyed Him.
[02:54:45.704 --> 02:54:46.545]  Well, I know this.
[02:54:46.645 --> 02:54:48.467]  I don't really have any more fear.
[02:54:48.487 --> 02:54:49.848]  I am secure.
[02:54:49.868 --> 02:54:53.731]  I know that when I'm fighting the New World Order, that's where I'm supposed to be.
[02:54:54.071 --> 02:54:57.973]  If I'm out, you know, just lavishing myself, relaxing, I don't feel good.
[02:54:58.493 --> 02:55:00.434]  I mean, we're supposed to be in this fight.
[02:55:00.494 --> 02:55:07.196]  Alex, there are times when me as a man, Pastor Bush, would just love to go fishing and say, forget it, let the world go to hell, I'm going to go fishing.
[02:55:07.476 --> 02:55:08.157]  But I can't.
[02:55:08.617 --> 02:55:09.217]  I can't do it.
[02:55:09.337 --> 02:55:10.398]  Let's cram one call in.
[02:55:10.438 --> 02:55:13.599]  I know, people, we've got to give ourselves over to doing the right thing.
[02:55:13.939 --> 02:55:15.860]  Jason in Maryland, last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:23.283]  Hello, you guys make some good points, but I was wondering what your interpretation of
[02:55:25.099 --> 02:55:31.203]  First Peter chapter 2 verse 19 is... Get my audio tape.
[02:55:32.004 --> 02:55:32.864]  I can read it now.
[02:55:33.084 --> 02:55:35.846]  Get the videotape and it will explain the whole thing to you.
[02:55:35.866 --> 02:55:37.547]  Sir, I'm trying to pose a question to you.
[02:55:38.488 --> 02:55:39.489]  Okay, we're almost out of time.
[02:55:39.529 --> 02:55:39.889]  Go ahead.
[02:55:40.149 --> 02:55:46.774]  For this is thankworthy, if a man for a good conscience towards the Father endures grief, suffering wrongfully.
[02:55:46.934 --> 02:55:51.798]  For what is it, glory, if you be by faith for your faults when you take it patiently?
[02:55:51.858 --> 02:55:53.719]  But ye do well if you suffer
[02:55:54.218 --> 02:55:56.439]  Patiently, this is acceptable for God.
[02:55:56.519 --> 02:55:57.419]  Okay, stop right there.
[02:55:57.499 --> 02:55:58.619]  That means... Stop, stop.
[02:55:58.659 --> 02:56:00.500]  That means suffering while you're writing.
[02:56:00.540 --> 02:56:01.540]  For righteousness' sake.
[02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:02.420]  We have nothing evil.
[02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:04.661]  It doesn't mean just suffer for no reason.
[02:56:04.681 --> 02:56:07.161]  It means you're going to be suffering because you're going to be fighting.
[02:56:07.601 --> 02:56:08.301]  Read your Bible.
[02:56:08.341 --> 02:56:09.042]  Faith people, please.
[02:56:09.102 --> 02:56:10.702]  I mean, how can you take that and twist it?
[02:56:10.742 --> 02:56:13.843]  It's saying you suffered to do the right thing.
[02:56:15.423 --> 02:56:16.083]  Man, I tell you.
[02:56:16.103 --> 02:56:18.784]  I mean, it's just any way... We have to do it again sometime.
[02:56:18.844 --> 02:56:19.404]  Yeah, we do.
[02:56:19.484 --> 02:56:21.405]  Any way to weasel out of this stuff.
[02:56:21.545 --> 02:56:22.465]  Unbelievable.
[02:56:23.303 --> 02:56:24.325]  God bless you all!
[02:56:26.208 --> 02:56:30.875]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
