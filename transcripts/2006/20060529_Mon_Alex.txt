[00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:06.551]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.271]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:10.112]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:11.553]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:13.213]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:17.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:22.176]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:26.758]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:29.279]  It is Memorial Day.
[00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:33.679]  The 29th day of May 2006.
[00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.620]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:50.825]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast, and Ray McGovern, senior level CIA analyst for Reagan and former President Bush, will be joining us on this Memorial Day.
[00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:53.246]  I hope to discuss...
[00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:03.531]  What our troops have supposedly fought and died for, that is the Bill of Rights and Constitution, home of the free, land of the brave, and how that's being dismantled.
[00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:06.192]  So what does Memorial Day mean to you?
[00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:19.675]  We are here, we're alive, because we know the New World Order is coming down on America like a ton of bricks, and the time is short before they launch the next level of their tyranny in this country and worldwide, and we need to fight them.
[00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:22.556]  We need to stop them right now.
[00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:32.576]  There was an evacuation of the Capitol office buildings.
[00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:38.878]  Over 140 schools were locked down for four hours in D.C.
[00:01:38.978 --> 00:01:39.699]  on Friday.
[00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.340]  And this really is a martial law drill.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.461]  This was the third time that this has happened in the last few years at the Capitol.
[00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:50.622]  But the smallest thing...
[00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:55.367]  And, of course, the Capitol is in a neighborhood where guns routinely go off.
[00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:56.767]  I've been in D.C.
[00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:09.573]  staying near the Capitol and heard automatic weapons fire or heard semi-automatic weapons fire, and the police and the public, when I looked out my hotel window, were acting like it was no big deal.
[00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:16.021]  And this whole thing is extremely, extremely suspicious.
[00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:34.416]  But I would almost hope that it was Bush ordering the Capitol Police at the drop of a hat to take over the Capitol and let them know who the boss is, compared to just the abject hysterical hysteria, the hand-wringing fear we saw.
[00:02:36.044 --> 00:02:39.807]  And I did witness over the weekend some replays, and it showed congressmen.
[00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:40.928]  Maybe you saw this.
[00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.269]  We've got a tape of it.
[00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:43.050]  We really want it.
[00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:56.962]  Congressmen sitting there trying to talk to the press, talk to news cameras, and having military-style police come over and tell them, turn your cell phone off and move away from that camera.
[00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.444]  Again, we're the boss.
[00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:00.925]  We work for the executive.
[00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.167]  We're going to tell you what to do, scum.
[00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:05.882]  We're going to keep you safe.
[00:03:05.922 --> 00:03:07.123]  We're going to protect you.
[00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:10.624]  It's like the Chinese emperors, empresses.
[00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:18.486]  They would put their feet in these little tight shoes that had basically a vice on the outside.
[00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:20.066]  They'd screw them tighter and tighter.
[00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:24.227]  They would have five, six, seven, eight inch long fingernails.
[00:03:24.907 --> 00:03:30.149]  You go, what does this have to do with the Capitol being shut down?
[00:03:31.517 --> 00:03:37.762]  You get guilds that grow up, societies, organizations that grow up around extreme power.
[00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:44.446]  And in the name of serving their leaders, they tend to put them in guilded cages.
[00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:53.893]  Kind of like Rapunzel up in the tall tower to keep her safe.
[00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:57.155]  Is that the story of Rapunzel?
[00:03:57.175 --> 00:03:57.695]  I don't remember.
[00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:06.957]  The point is that the emperors of China, dynasty after dynasty, would actually fall, and then one of their servants would found the new dynasty.
[00:04:07.437 --> 00:04:10.118]  Their feet were not wrapped so tight they couldn't walk.
[00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:11.978]  They had short fingernails.
[00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.359]  Oh, it's so stylish that you're an emperor.
[00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:18.460]  We must feed you because your fingernails are so long.
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.880]  The style is so cool.
[00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:22.638]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:24.619]  Oh, there's a jackhammer.
[00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:26.780]  We must lock the whole city down.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.542]  We must tell congressmen what to do and point guns at them.
[00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:36.264]  Oh, we must have checkpoints on the highways of America.
[00:04:36.324 --> 00:04:37.985]  We must search all your homes.
[00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:39.766]  We must listen to all your conversations.
[00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.867]  We must totally control you.
[00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:45.547]  Yes, it's to keep you safe.
[00:04:46.247 --> 00:04:48.149]  I'm just trying to keep you safe.
[00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.010]  Like Grimer Wormwood in Lord of the Rings.
[00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.912]  Oh, your highness, don't get too upset.
[00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:56.073]  No, stay here.
[00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:57.674]  Oh, there, that's better.
[00:04:58.314 --> 00:04:59.135]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.155 --> 00:04:59.575]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:03.181]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.362 --> 00:05:06.442]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:10.484]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:14.765]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:18.886]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:20.867]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:24.348]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.368 --> 00:05:25.448]  The medical bills.
[00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.090]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.271]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:35.353]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:41.936]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:43.176]  We're good to go.
[00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:43.656]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.322]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:07.565]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:13.969]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:21.675]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.855 --> 00:06:25.898]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:31.762]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:06:31.962 --> 00:06:45.071]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:53.877]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places USA now for only $29, plus shipping and handling, by calling New Millennium at 888-7000.
[00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:56.239]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.896 --> 00:07:06.880]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.942]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:14.725]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:19.709]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:24.632]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:07:24.852 --> 00:07:27.514]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:27.754 --> 00:07:30.636]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:32.937]  Looking for profit?
[00:07:32.997 --> 00:07:34.397]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:37.578]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offered both.
[00:07:37.978 --> 00:07:45.260]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.101]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:50.882]  Secure your position today.
[00:07:51.182 --> 00:07:52.402]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:52.442 --> 00:07:52.702]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:04.468]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:07.833]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.244 --> 00:08:20.748]  Thomas in Denmark, John in Texas, Mike in Maryland, Tim in Oklahoma, and many others.
[00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.569]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.253]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Memorial Day edition, the 29th of May, 2006, is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:27.273 --> 00:08:28.815]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:08:36.684 --> 00:08:38.526]  Well, where to begin today?
[00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:42.869]  A construction drill provides a martial law drill.
[00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:55.859]  Capital shutdown highlights manic panic of post-9-11 mentality is the headline by Paul Joseph Watson today up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.121]  What's really going on here?
[00:08:58.822 --> 00:09:01.324]  This is the third time in the last couple of years that
[00:09:02.452 --> 00:09:03.293]  We're good to go.
[00:09:23.446 --> 00:09:25.007]  Stomping around everywhere.
[00:09:25.068 --> 00:09:26.889]  They're controlled by the executive.
[00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:33.214]  They locked down over 140 schools for four hours in the city of D.C.
[00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:35.936]  It has nothing to do with reality.
[00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:40.446]  It's unbelievable.
[00:09:40.686 --> 00:10:03.915]  And we go back to the anthrax attacks, clearly launched by the executive branch, the White House on Cipro, three and a half weeks before the anthrax first shows up in Boca Raton, Florida, at American Media, to the very photo editor who'd done big stories on his two drunken daughters falling down on top of each other, and every other Bush enemy basically gets an anthrax letter in the mail, and the Patriot Act...
[00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:04.995]  We're good to go.
[00:10:20.572 --> 00:10:23.773]  Parts of the Capitol are shut down because of anthrax.
[00:10:24.193 --> 00:10:28.895]  This is in October of 2001, and the USA Patriot Act passes.
[00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:49.843]  On Friday, while all this hysteria is going on, the Intelligence Committee and then one of the other committees that was about to confirm Mr. Hayden, Michael V. Hayden, General Hayden, head of the CIA, which they later did that day, was locked down with armed men in the chambers with machine guns.
[00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:52.536]  With automatic weapons.
[00:10:53.457 --> 00:10:55.777]  So this is the backdrop that we have.
[00:10:55.837 --> 00:11:01.618]  Meanwhile, again, they locked down most of the schools, 140 plus schools, in the city.
[00:11:02.558 --> 00:11:08.760]  Because a neocon congressman was in the parking garage and thought he heard gunfire.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:15.861]  It was, of course, a gas-powered jackhammer right outside the parking garage.
[00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:17.361]  And then the hysteria began.
[00:11:17.842 --> 00:11:19.902]  The mind control began, so some women...
[00:11:20.692 --> 00:11:21.493]  We're good to go.
[00:11:47.568 --> 00:11:52.912]  In some cases, even sharks in the first few days got into some of the areas on the outside of the city.
[00:11:53.572 --> 00:11:54.933]  People were shooting sharks.
[00:11:55.874 --> 00:11:58.276]  People were shooting at looters coming into their houses.
[00:11:58.316 --> 00:11:59.156]  You'd hear gunfire.
[00:11:59.457 --> 00:12:02.299]  Police were shooting wild dogs that had rabies.
[00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:03.960]  They were shooting alligators.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.341]  People would hear that.
[00:12:05.421 --> 00:12:07.263]  Cops over the next hill would hear it.
[00:12:07.983 --> 00:12:09.064]  They would freak out.
[00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.852]  And then they would start just shooting in that direction.
[00:12:13.373 --> 00:12:23.280]  Remember the military workers were going in to fix one of the dams and the police shot and killed, what, four of them?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.762]  That got swept under the rug real fast.
[00:12:25.822 --> 00:12:30.585]  And so, oh my gosh, we've got to send in the FBI leading the U.S.
[00:12:30.705 --> 00:12:33.247]  Army and National Guard for gun confiscation.
[00:12:34.173 --> 00:12:35.374]  No food, no water.
[00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:41.597]  In fact, emergency managers, one of them sat there and waited five days while his mother starved to death and died in a nursing home.
[00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:42.718]  He was dutiful.
[00:12:43.058 --> 00:12:45.019]  He followed orders and didn't save his mama.
[00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:50.021]  They kept the thousands of firefighters and police on small boats with private citizens out of the city.
[00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:55.884]  The military got to do what they do best here in America, take our guns, what they've trained for for so long.
[00:12:55.965 --> 00:12:58.606]  So we have this backdrop.
[00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:03.967]  But on this Memorial Day, think of what the land of the free, home of the brave has turned into.
[00:13:04.308 --> 00:13:07.529]  The land of the hysterical, cowardly lemmings.
[00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.651]  That is what we're now turned into.
[00:13:10.771 --> 00:13:14.113]  I mean, cars backfire in D.C., they lock down the Capitol.
[00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:17.054]  A jackhammer goes off, they lock down the Capitol.
[00:13:17.715 --> 00:13:23.658]  There's a shooting a mile away between two drug dealers, which has always happened in D.C., one of the highest crime rates in the country.
[00:13:23.858 --> 00:13:25.379]  Total gun ban, of course you're going to have that.
[00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:27.320]  They lock down the Capitol.
[00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.174]  And routinely, you'll have a small plane off course.
[00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:37.117]  An hour after it's even reported, it finally gets to the Capitol, they lock it down.
[00:13:37.758 --> 00:13:39.019]  Any excuse to do this.
[00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:41.721]  And listen, we've seen this hysteria before.
[00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.083]  This is done on purpose, much of it.
[00:13:44.203 --> 00:13:52.670]  Or they use real events, and then their policies, the default policy, causes even more hysteria.
[00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.514]  So some of it's staged, some of it is just the hysteria that's come out of the past staged events.
[00:13:57.934 --> 00:13:58.295]  Austin, Texas, 2000.
[00:14:16.317 --> 00:14:17.338]  Phone starts ringing.
[00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:18.919]  Alex, turn on the news.
[00:14:18.939 --> 00:14:20.400]  7 o'clock at night, I turn it on.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.921]  Huge nuclear spill.
[00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:23.382]  Extremely radioactive.
[00:14:23.823 --> 00:14:25.504]  Austin must be evacuated.
[00:14:25.784 --> 00:14:27.986]  They're locking down I-35.
[00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:29.547]  They're calling out the U.S.
[00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:30.048]  Army.
[00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:31.889]  Total standstills.
[00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:32.429]  Panic.
[00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.610]  Hysteria.
[00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:35.992]  There were car wrecks all over the city.
[00:14:36.252 --> 00:14:39.235]  People jumping in their cars, driving north.
[00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:40.676]  Huge traffic jams.
[00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:43.298]  And I'm stuck in traffic at midnight.
[00:14:43.738 --> 00:14:44.378]  We're good to go.
[00:14:44.498 --> 00:14:44.939]  I think?
[00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:01.773]  I go to Belton, Texas in 2000.
[00:15:02.593 --> 00:15:03.654]  The mayor stands up.
[00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:05.316]  I have video of this in Road to Tyranny.
[00:15:05.876 --> 00:15:08.299]  The mayor stands up to the dais.
[00:15:08.819 --> 00:15:10.201]  They call a press conference.
[00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:15.766]  Now, they told the media quietly in a press release that it was going to be a drill.
[00:15:15.826 --> 00:15:17.527]  In this case, they at least said it was going to be a drill.
[00:15:18.508 --> 00:15:23.033]  But then when the mayor gets up, he announces, we've been hit by terrorists, we've got deaths.
[00:15:23.533 --> 00:15:24.254]  It's serious.
[00:15:24.941 --> 00:15:33.535]  The media the next day has headlines, Belton hit by terrorist, and you read, in one case it was like ten paragraphs, and then it mentions it was a drill.
[00:15:33.876 --> 00:15:37.562]  The average person reading this... Well, let me go back.
[00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:40.007]  So he announces we've been hit by terrorists.
[00:15:40.368 --> 00:15:41.328]  We go outside.
[00:15:41.388 --> 00:15:45.729]  They've got the elementary and middle school students there.
[00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:48.450]  They have the high school drama department there to lead it.
[00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.431]  They put fake red syrup on them, fake arms blown off, fake intestines hanging out.
[00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:54.731]  It's pretty gruesome.
[00:15:55.012 --> 00:15:56.492]  Smoke machines inside.
[00:15:57.805 --> 00:15:59.786]  Helicopters flying around, U.S.
[00:15:59.886 --> 00:16:02.806]  Army Special Forces walks up to us and goes, What are you doing?
[00:16:03.006 --> 00:16:04.607]  We don't like you videotaping us.
[00:16:04.767 --> 00:16:07.848]  And I go, Well, then you can just get out of my face, boy!
[00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:09.088]  You can see the video.
[00:16:09.508 --> 00:16:11.089]  I just say, Hey, we got a right to.
[00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:16.190]  Hey, you're the guys videotaped us last time when they ran an illegal checkpoint.
[00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.112]  And then later admitted it was a drill, but it wasn't a drill.
[00:16:19.292 --> 00:16:27.958]  They pulled over real cars and real buses and searched them, in one case for eight hours, and it was a drill, but the Greyhound bus they pulled over, they never told them that.
[00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:29.900]  So, a drill with real people.
[00:16:30.709 --> 00:16:32.030]  But I digress.
[00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.631]  The same troops come over.
[00:16:34.111 --> 00:16:35.973]  All of a sudden, they blow up a car.
[00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:37.213]  All of a sudden, everybody's standing there.
[00:16:37.233 --> 00:16:37.974]  They don't tell anybody.
[00:16:38.014 --> 00:16:40.055]  All of a sudden, this car catches on fire.
[00:16:40.435 --> 00:16:41.816]  Fire starts shooting out.
[00:16:42.297 --> 00:16:44.198]  They're at the local city hall, okay?
[00:16:44.238 --> 00:16:49.481]  There's a car with fire shooting out of it, burning to the ground.
[00:16:50.002 --> 00:16:55.085]  Helicopters, smoke, troops, Marines, Navy, I mean,
[00:16:55.618 --> 00:16:56.559]  We've got it on video.
[00:16:56.839 --> 00:16:59.822]  Robots with shotguns are driving around.
[00:16:59.842 --> 00:17:01.824]  All of this is happening.
[00:17:01.944 --> 00:17:04.767]  Weird guys in black uniforms who won't say who they are.
[00:17:05.288 --> 00:17:07.290]  Black suburbans, blue suburbans.
[00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.451]  All of this.
[00:17:08.771 --> 00:17:10.933]  And see, people in town haven't been told about this.
[00:17:11.514 --> 00:17:16.179]  So we go over to the local HEB and people are going, there's some kind of terrorist in this.
[00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:18.081]  What's going on right here?
[00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:18.541]  And see,
[00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:20.362]  This is what this is all designed to do.
[00:17:20.602 --> 00:17:25.804]  Then the next day in the Belton paper, Belton hit by terrorists, and people are reading this with fear.
[00:17:26.344 --> 00:17:28.185]  For a couple minutes, you get to the end of the article.
[00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:29.685]  It's like a half page of the front page.
[00:17:29.705 --> 00:17:32.146]  At the very bottom it says, oh, but it was all just a drill.
[00:17:33.286 --> 00:17:35.647]  See, it's War of the Worlds hysteria.
[00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:41.009]  They've had thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of these drills everywhere.
[00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.010]  Fake nuclear spills, fake bio-attacks.
[00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:45.171]  And pretty soon...
[00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:50.186]  Somebody hears a jackhammer, they say it may be gunfire.
[00:17:50.266 --> 00:17:56.469]  Then some women staffers see a plainclothes cop, which anybody can tell what a plainclothes cop is.
[00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:57.850]  They freak out.
[00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.330]  The SWAT teams freak out.
[00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.591]  Now they've got two reports.
[00:18:00.851 --> 00:18:06.054]  They're running around pointing guns at congressmen, telling congressmen, get out of here, you're not allowed to be on TV.
[00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.135]  Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Black Mask.
[00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:09.215]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:09.476 --> 00:18:10.376]  Oh, yes.
[00:18:11.136 --> 00:18:12.337]  So this is how it works.
[00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:13.258]  But listen, I'm not done in 2000.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.362]  Months after the nuclear spill, downtown Austin shut down.
[00:18:18.402 --> 00:18:19.682]  There's an evacuation.
[00:18:19.722 --> 00:18:23.864]  Police officers opened the back of a car and passed out.
[00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:24.965]  It's incredible.
[00:18:25.365 --> 00:18:27.066]  They've got the Arab right now.
[00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:28.287]  We pull up.
[00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:29.607]  We get video.
[00:18:29.627 --> 00:18:36.791]  It's an obvious Marine, Arab Marine, high and tight, shaking hands, laughing with the cops, looking around.
[00:18:36.831 --> 00:18:39.552]  There's other plainclothes troops standing around.
[00:18:40.013 --> 00:18:42.994]  They drive up to Mike up on the overpass, tell him to turn his camera off.
[00:18:43.014 --> 00:18:43.834]  We put this on local TV.
[00:18:43.854 --> 00:18:44.675]  I'll put this on a film.
[00:18:45.885 --> 00:18:46.265]  We're good to go.
[00:18:57.848 --> 00:18:59.169]  I run on TV.
[00:18:59.669 --> 00:19:00.689]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:19:00.729 --> 00:19:02.710]  Two days later, it creates more hysteria.
[00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.891]  They have a staged deal with the DPS from a smell.
[00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:07.812]  Turns out that was a drill, a test.
[00:19:08.132 --> 00:19:09.693]  Hundreds have to go to the hospital.
[00:19:09.973 --> 00:19:10.733]  Total hysteria.
[00:19:10.773 --> 00:19:14.995]  I go out there, jump on live TV in front of the camera, announce it's all a staged event.
[00:19:15.335 --> 00:19:16.916]  I call up the local affiliate.
[00:19:16.996 --> 00:19:17.616]  I bluff them.
[00:19:17.736 --> 00:19:19.437]  I go, I've got evidence this is a drill.
[00:19:19.817 --> 00:19:21.238]  You better admit you're part of it.
[00:19:21.438 --> 00:19:24.139]  They go on TV two hours later and admit it was a drill.
[00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:26.720]  I mean, we are just defeating these people.
[00:19:27.697 --> 00:19:31.779]  And boy, they stopped those things here in Austin because I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.502]  I'm not going to put up with you doing fake nuclear spills, fake bio-attacks.
[00:19:36.702 --> 00:19:39.123]  Now, they still do it in schools and terrify the little kids.
[00:19:40.124 --> 00:19:42.025]  But they backed off on their public stuff.
[00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:44.246]  And they got your kids captive doing it to them every month.
[00:19:45.046 --> 00:19:49.247]  But all over the country, every day, I see probably ten articles about drills.
[00:19:49.347 --> 00:19:51.268]  I mean, there have been thousands of these things.
[00:19:51.728 --> 00:19:52.909]  And this is training you.
[00:19:52.969 --> 00:19:55.109]  It's like Jim Jones with the Kool-Aid drills.
[00:19:55.749 --> 00:19:58.530]  They're just drilling you to be slaves for martial law.
[00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.311]  We'll talk to Thomas and Dan Martin when we get back.

[00:23:05.973 --> 00:23:08.134]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.

[00:24:05.092 --> 00:24:08.673]  I'm going to go to your calls from Denmark to Virginia here in just a moment.
[00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:12.134]  But bottom line, we need to add this to the article Paul's put out.
[00:24:12.734 --> 00:24:15.015]  This is all the response.
[00:24:15.055 --> 00:24:23.838]  This is all the consequences of the government, by design, they've known exactly what they're doing, yelling fire in a theater over and over and over again.
[00:24:23.878 --> 00:24:34.421]  They've got the people of this country so on edge that they're ready to just run in hysteria into the arms of this Darth Vader-clad stormtroopers at the drop of a hat.
[00:24:35.484 --> 00:24:37.968]  I mean, everybody knows what a jackhammer sounds like.
[00:24:38.488 --> 00:24:42.073]  And it does sound a little bit similar to an automatic rifle discharging.
[00:24:43.355 --> 00:24:48.543]  But at the same time, it just shows what this country's turned into.
[00:24:48.643 --> 00:24:50.145]  Understand, I live in a city.
[00:24:50.788 --> 00:24:51.228]  We're good to go.
[00:25:08.437 --> 00:25:09.957]  This is America.
[00:25:10.378 --> 00:25:10.698]  Okay?
[00:25:11.078 --> 00:25:12.818]  I live in Central Texas where the U.S.
[00:25:12.898 --> 00:25:17.799]  Army, back in 1998, has checkpoints on the highway pulling people out of buses.
[00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:18.719]  Okay?
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.040]  I mean, that's why we've been aware of this for a long time.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.581]  That's why I was talking about martial law and troops.
[00:25:24.641 --> 00:25:33.483]  I mean, I live in Texas where police chiefs throw Delta Force out for trying to bribe them, and Delta Force comes back and still covertly leases buildings and then blows them up.
[00:25:33.983 --> 00:25:37.684]  I live in Texas where I got police on tape admitting foreign troops were with them.
[00:25:37.924 --> 00:25:40.105]  Police chiefs admitting it.
[00:25:40.485 --> 00:25:46.307]  Folks, we've had Czechoslovakian troops running around with buildings blowing up, okay?
[00:25:46.947 --> 00:25:48.808]  This is the kind of stuff we go through here.
[00:25:49.388 --> 00:25:50.648]  This is what we live through.
[00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:53.969]  And it's all psychological warfare testing.
[00:25:54.009 --> 00:25:56.910]  I read a declassified Army after action report.
[00:25:58.283 --> 00:25:59.245]  Well, I'll get to it later.
[00:25:59.265 --> 00:25:59.987]  I'll take your calls.
[00:26:00.027 --> 00:26:00.609]  It doesn't matter.
[00:26:00.669 --> 00:26:05.781]  About the Panamanian invasion in 1989, do you know what they did for a solid year before that?
[00:26:06.502 --> 00:26:08.026]  Exactly what they're doing here.
[00:26:09.304 --> 00:26:10.085]  Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:10.125 --> 00:26:11.566]  We're in so much trouble, folks.
[00:26:11.606 --> 00:26:18.452]  We're in so much... I mean, imagine Americans now hear a jackhammer and almost all the schools... It says 144.
[00:26:18.772 --> 00:26:20.694]  Is that all the schools in D.C.?
[00:26:20.774 --> 00:26:21.154]  I don't know.
[00:26:21.695 --> 00:26:24.057]  It sounds like most of them are all of them.
[00:26:24.077 --> 00:26:25.058]  144 schools locked down.
[00:26:25.658 --> 00:26:26.779]  The Capitol locked down.
[00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:30.863]  And meanwhile, every time there's some key confirmation that's in trouble, this happens.
[00:26:30.963 --> 00:26:36.908]  Every time some bill's in trouble, and then Hayden got approved right after all this happened to CIA director.
[00:26:37.586 --> 00:26:40.487]  Let's talk to Thomas, listening in Denmark.
[00:26:40.587 --> 00:26:41.367]  Thomas, welcome.
[00:26:41.948 --> 00:26:42.228]  Alex.
[00:26:42.628 --> 00:26:43.008]  Yes, sir.
[00:26:43.428 --> 00:26:43.908]  It's an honor.
[00:26:45.109 --> 00:26:46.069]  I'm a first-time caller.
[00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:47.110]  Well, welcome, sir.
[00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.870]  Thank you.
[00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.091]  You sound like an American living in Denmark.
[00:26:50.951 --> 00:26:53.952]  I've been over there many times, and that's why I listen to your show.
[00:26:55.092 --> 00:26:56.413]  I have many friends over there as well.
[00:26:57.408 --> 00:26:59.710]  But they said you're calling from Denmark.
[00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:00.571]  That is true, yeah.
[00:27:00.831 --> 00:27:01.292]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:27:01.312 --> 00:27:15.003]  All right, let me tell you, there's a 100% media blackout concerning the corruption in America here and about the 9-1-1 truth movement, and no one has any clue about this over here.
[00:27:15.964 --> 00:27:18.246]  Let me tell you, we are sheep, okay?
[00:27:18.906 --> 00:27:21.869]  And I have many friends over there, and I think it's a disgrace.
[00:27:22.329 --> 00:27:23.170]  I'm getting sick of it.
[00:27:24.741 --> 00:27:25.922]  So let me tell you.
[00:27:26.042 --> 00:27:30.564]  Well, I just got interviewed by national television from Denmark, and that's going to be out.
[00:27:31.185 --> 00:27:32.926]  Actually, that was my question as well.
[00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:35.127]  But let me tell you what we have done.
[00:27:35.227 --> 00:27:39.089]  We're a group of guys that put together an information package.
[00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:44.713]  We have four, no, wait a minute, two movies and two lectures, and we made a movie ourselves.
[00:27:45.473 --> 00:27:47.634]  And I've been sitting here putting subtitles on this crap.
[00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:51.757]  And I'm going to send it out to 100 celebrities here.
[00:27:52.332 --> 00:27:53.053]  Well, good job.
[00:27:53.073 --> 00:27:55.835]  It's people like you that are going to defeat this new world order.
[00:27:55.855 --> 00:27:58.316]  But let me ask you this, Thomas.
[00:27:58.356 --> 00:28:02.259]  What do you think of the Capitol and D.C.
[00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:06.322]  lockdown because of a jackhammer Friday?
[00:28:06.342 --> 00:28:06.422]  Yeah.
[00:28:18.911 --> 00:28:19.511]  That's insane.
[00:28:19.791 --> 00:28:21.292]  But it doesn't surprise me.
[00:28:21.452 --> 00:28:23.012]  Nothing surprises me anymore, though.
[00:28:25.213 --> 00:28:27.234]  But that's what we're doing.
[00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:32.556]  And I would recommend people in other countries doing this as well, because 9-1-1 expects everyone.
[00:28:32.716 --> 00:28:36.517]  I mean, you can see it in our legislation today, right?
[00:28:36.717 --> 00:28:37.577]  And it's everywhere.
[00:28:38.478 --> 00:28:42.979]  Worldwide, they're using 9-1-1 as a pretext to set up a police state.
[00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:43.699]  Exactly.
[00:28:43.719 --> 00:28:48.341]  And like you said, around the time the Charlie Sheen came out, you had a TV crew in your studio.
[00:28:49.147 --> 00:28:52.590]  And I was going to ask you, which TV station was that?
[00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:57.754]  I know it's the big national TV government run, government funded.
[00:28:58.435 --> 00:28:59.155]  I forget, sir.
[00:28:59.856 --> 00:29:03.219]  I know it's supposedly the biggest in Denmark.
[00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:05.381]  List some names and maybe it will pop in my head.
[00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:05.441]  DR?
[00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:07.702]  Yeah, I think that's it.
[00:29:07.722 --> 00:29:08.463]  All right.
[00:29:09.024 --> 00:29:09.924]  Yeah.
[00:29:09.964 --> 00:29:11.265]  Well, we have heard nothing about that.
[00:29:11.325 --> 00:29:15.409]  Also, I'm sad to hear about the Dylan Avery lawsuit or whatever.
[00:29:16.957 --> 00:29:18.386]  Well, see, that's how these rumors work.
[00:29:18.446 --> 00:29:19.472]  There is no lawsuit.
[00:29:20.274 --> 00:29:21.395]  I'll be good.
[00:29:21.415 --> 00:29:30.678]  The French brothers don't like it that he's using their footage of the firefighters talking about bombs in the building, and it's clear, fair use, and it's all threats.
[00:29:31.118 --> 00:29:32.138]  So I appreciate your call.
[00:29:32.739 --> 00:29:33.559]  I appreciate the call.
[00:29:34.459 --> 00:29:35.199]  That's how this works.
[00:29:35.239 --> 00:29:40.481]  Somebody sends him a letter, and then by the time it's done with it, it's Martians have attacked Dylan Avery.
[00:29:41.082 --> 00:29:47.224]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more of your phone calls on the other side of this quick break.
[00:29:47.244 --> 00:29:47.704]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.630]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:54.791]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.811 --> 00:29:58.413]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.615 --> 00:30:10.138]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.379 --> 00:30:12.179]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:13.580]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.905 --> 00:30:14.445]  We're good to go.
[00:30:14.465 --> 00:30:14.666]  I think?
[00:30:35.723 --> 00:30:41.067]  The widely researched natural herbal supplement for regulating blood pressure and maintaining optimum heart health.
[00:30:41.388 --> 00:30:47.472]  Did you know that the safety and effectiveness of heart care is backed by over 100 clinical trials and experimental studies?
[00:30:47.873 --> 00:30:48.313]  Act now.
[00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:54.498]  Visit us online at researchedherbs.com or call us at 1-800-845-3841 to start protecting yourself from the silent killer.
[00:30:54.718 --> 00:30:55.038]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:05.742]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.782 --> 00:31:06.282]  are located?
[00:31:06.502 --> 00:31:09.885]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:10.125 --> 00:31:14.829]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:15.109 --> 00:31:20.113]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.253 --> 00:31:20.954]  We're good to go.
[00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.692]  What has been deemed the healthiest oil on the earth?
[00:32:04.904 --> 00:32:06.045]  Virgin coconut oil.
[00:32:06.365 --> 00:32:08.747]  What did Woman's Day magazine call the miracle oil?
[00:32:09.267 --> 00:32:10.348]  Virgin coconut oil.
[00:32:10.788 --> 00:32:16.152]  Why have people reported increased energy, reduction in food craving, and an easier time losing weight?
[00:32:16.613 --> 00:32:17.934]  Virgin coconut oil.
[00:32:18.234 --> 00:32:19.215]  The answer is clear.
[00:32:19.555 --> 00:32:22.397]  It's time to switch to virgin coconut oil by Nourishing Planet.
[00:32:22.657 --> 00:32:28.101]  Made from organic coconuts, Nourishing Planet virgin coconut oil is produced in the pristine Fiji Islands.
[00:32:28.542 --> 00:32:30.383]  Using coconuts within hours of opening,
[00:32:30.743 --> 00:32:37.905]  Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil retains more of the nutrition, including the tocotrienols, which are powerful vitamin E antioxidants.
[00:32:38.265 --> 00:32:43.146]  The minimally processed coconuts allow for delightful taste and the aroma of fresh coconuts.
[00:32:43.746 --> 00:32:48.248]  Order your Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil by visiting ECOVIVA.com.
[00:32:48.648 --> 00:32:51.708]  That's E-C-O-V-I-V-A dot com.

[00:32:54.002 --> 00:32:54.022]  680-8484.
[00:32:54.042 --> 00:32:54.342]  That's 1-866-680-8484.
[00:32:54.402 --> 00:32:59.984]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:00.004 --> 00:33:02.645]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[00:33:20.996 --> 00:33:22.536]  Get some more of those out of the way.
[00:33:22.656 --> 00:33:27.118]  And then, speaking of bioterror drills, here's a report here.
[00:33:27.178 --> 00:33:29.458]  Bioterrorism drill on Thursday.
[00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:39.621]  In order to practice responding to a public health disaster, volunteers are needed to act as patients in a mock bioterror drill being held by the Williamson County Health Department.
[00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:44.922]  Following an orientation, volunteer patients will wait in lines, receive mock medical screening.
[00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:50.666]  Review of fake patient forms and go through a simulated dispensing station.
[00:33:50.726 --> 00:33:54.109]  No medical procedures will be performed and no actual medication will be dispensed.
[00:33:54.429 --> 00:33:57.211]  The drill will be held on June 1st from 8.30 a.m.
[00:33:57.231 --> 00:33:57.872]  to 12 noon.
[00:33:58.272 --> 00:34:01.055]  If interested in participating, please respond for location.
[00:34:01.835 --> 00:34:04.377]  And this is in or around Georgetown, Texas.
[00:34:04.497 --> 00:34:06.439]  It's not okay to contact this poster.
[00:34:06.739 --> 00:34:07.880]  This is out of Craigslist.
[00:34:08.901 --> 00:34:11.043]  And, I mean, this is just classic.
[00:34:11.103 --> 00:34:11.923]  It's just everywhere.
[00:34:11.963 --> 00:34:12.904]  It's just ongoing.
[00:34:12.944 --> 00:34:14.766]  This is right here in Central Texas.
[00:34:15.447 --> 00:34:17.108]  Another report here out of the Daily Mail.
[00:34:17.229 --> 00:34:19.931]  Babies aborted for not being perfect in the UK.
[00:34:20.952 --> 00:34:23.393]  Bush bans protests at military funerals.
[00:34:23.774 --> 00:34:25.615]  On and on and on.
[00:34:26.136 --> 00:34:28.558]  The gracious leader, he decides what to ban.
[00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.301]  But it's free speech we don't like, so it's okay.
[00:34:33.402 --> 00:34:35.243]  But right now, let's go to John in Texas.
[00:34:35.303 --> 00:34:36.144]  John, go ahead.
[00:34:36.164 --> 00:34:38.506]  Hi, Alex.
[00:34:39.006 --> 00:34:39.486]  Hello, sir.
[00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:44.991]  Alex, about a week ago, I was reading an editorial in a paper here in Houston.
[00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:50.261]  And it was a guy that lost a daughter in the Lockerbie Scotland bombing.
[00:34:51.042 --> 00:34:57.266]  He was condemning Bush for recognizing Muammar Gaddafi and pretty much forgiving him for his past transgressions anyway.
[00:34:57.846 --> 00:35:00.408]  But as I was reading that, I was thinking about Edwin Wilson.
[00:35:00.568 --> 00:35:02.189]  Do you ever remember Edwin Wilson?
[00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:03.570]  I do vaguely.
[00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.670]  Why don't you refresh?
[00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.813]  He got caught here in Houston shipping C-4 to Muammar Gaddafi in the early 80s.
[00:35:09.634 --> 00:35:11.635]  He insisted he was doing it for the CIA.
[00:35:11.835 --> 00:35:13.336]  The government said he was a rogue agent.
[00:35:14.051 --> 00:35:16.653]  And he went to trial and they sentenced him like life in prison.
[00:35:17.234 --> 00:35:24.720]  But about a year ago, his lawyer uncovered the fact that he really was working for the CIA and they let him out of prison and pretty much, they totally exonerated him.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.061]  That's right, I remember that.
[00:35:26.602 --> 00:35:30.565]  But I was sitting there thinking, I says, well, why wasn't anybody investigating?
[00:35:30.605 --> 00:35:34.808]  What was the CIA shipping C4 to Muammar Gaddafi a terrorist to?
[00:35:35.989 --> 00:35:40.193]  Well, I mean, it's part of the public record that MI6 hired Al Qaeda.
[00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:42.306]  In the late 90s.
[00:35:42.566 --> 00:35:43.707]  They are intelligence.
[00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:45.748]  They are working for the globalists.
[00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:47.189]  They were founded by the globalists.
[00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:55.633]  But nobody, I mean, they totally exonerated them, let them out of prison, but nobody in the Congress or anything said, hey, what was the CIA shipping C4 to a terrorist nation for?
[00:35:55.673 --> 00:36:04.678]  Well, what's really scary is whenever a CIA officer, agent, gets caught following orders, they'll put them in prison just to deny it.
[00:36:04.778 --> 00:36:07.400]  I mean, people working for this government should remember that.
[00:36:08.672 --> 00:36:11.654]  I got one more question I want to ask you, Alex.
[00:36:11.934 --> 00:36:18.839]  I got news accounts that the Mexican Army was sending troops in here to help during Hurricane Katrina, but I never heard any news reports that they went back home.
[00:36:18.879 --> 00:36:19.439]  Where'd they go?
[00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:20.860]  No, we never heard those.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.602]  They were in San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans.
[00:36:24.443 --> 00:36:25.844]  They were in areas of Mississippi.
[00:36:26.624 --> 00:36:28.225]  And I never heard about them going home.
[00:36:28.305 --> 00:36:31.227]  Sir, we have the Los Zetas, who are current Mexican military.
[00:36:31.247 --> 00:36:32.728]  They're not former, like the news says.
[00:36:33.228 --> 00:36:35.310]  Running around killing people right here in Texas.
[00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.751]  And back of the newspaper...
[00:36:38.971 --> 00:36:39.651]  Well, that's all I got.
[00:36:39.791 --> 00:36:40.311]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:36:40.351 --> 00:36:40.932]  Thank you, John.
[00:36:40.972 --> 00:36:42.212]  I'm glad you raised that point.
[00:36:42.532 --> 00:36:51.615]  There have been so many cases of our government defunding al-Qaeda in 1998-99 to attack the Serbs.
[00:36:52.195 --> 00:36:53.236]  That's part of the record.
[00:36:53.296 --> 00:36:55.737]  It's admitted over and over again.
[00:36:55.837 --> 00:36:56.737]  Al-Qaeda does this.
[00:36:56.817 --> 00:36:58.257]  Al-Qaeda does that for our governments.
[00:36:58.297 --> 00:37:00.658]  But, oh, our government's not involved with them.
[00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:04.780]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.020]  Mike, where are you calling us from?
[00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:08.400]  I'm calling from Rockville, Maryland.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:08.960]  Welcome.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.161]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:37:10.181 --> 00:37:11.121]  Thank you for all that you do.
[00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:18.024]  And if it wasn't for you and people like you, I'd just be one of the four hapless sheeple walking around scratching his head wondering what was going on.
[00:37:18.884 --> 00:37:26.108]  And we have a new DC911 Truth Movement that it's in the beginning stages.
[00:37:26.128 --> 00:37:27.428]  May I plug our website?
[00:37:27.968 --> 00:37:28.729]  Sure, go ahead, sir.
[00:37:28.969 --> 00:37:36.012]  Okay, it's dc911truth.org and I want to beseech people to come out of the shadows, all the patriots and
[00:37:36.516 --> 00:37:39.338]  Don't be afraid and help spread the word.
[00:37:39.878 --> 00:37:51.086]  Me and one of my fellow members were handing out flyers accusing the government of being complicit in 9-11 in downtown Bethesda, Maryland at a movie theater where they were showing Flight 93.
[00:37:51.566 --> 00:37:53.828]  We must have handed out two or three hundred of them.
[00:37:54.488 --> 00:37:55.809]  So we're showing films.
[00:37:55.869 --> 00:37:59.191]  We showed your film, the one about 9-11, the rise of the police state.
[00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:00.932]  We've shown Loose Chains.
[00:38:00.952 --> 00:38:03.014]  We've shown Muhammad Antal's Flying Circus.
[00:38:03.499 --> 00:38:09.683]  So we're going through a teething process right now, trying to get organized, trying to find out where we want to go.
[00:38:10.124 --> 00:38:12.225]  But it's dc911truths.org.
[00:38:12.345 --> 00:38:14.527]  I have an amusing story I'd like to tell you.
[00:38:14.547 --> 00:38:15.227]  It won't take too long.
[00:38:16.108 --> 00:38:20.751]  I was at a restaurant, and I tried to make it a point to tell at least two people every day about 9-1-1.
[00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:26.175]  I try not to be too obnoxious, and I don't, you know, I try to be methodical about it.
[00:38:26.755 --> 00:38:32.539]  So I was sitting at the lunch counter, and this woman a couple seats away from me said, yeah, you know, 9-1-1 was inside job.
[00:38:33.024 --> 00:38:40.406]  I was reading Wester Tarpley's book while I was waiting for my brunch, 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror, which, by the way, he's a member of our group, by the way.
[00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:45.708]  Nice guy, but the only paleo-conservative there, so we don't exactly agree on everything.
[00:38:46.248 --> 00:38:48.528]  But at any rate, she asked me, what job do I do?
[00:38:48.568 --> 00:38:50.889]  I said, well, I work for an auto parts place to drive a van.
[00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:51.769]  I said, what do you do?
[00:38:52.249 --> 00:38:53.830]  She says, I work for Homeland Security.
[00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.811]  I said, oh, my God, this is an opportunity of a lifetime.
[00:38:57.311 --> 00:38:58.891]  I told her about Bill No.
[00:38:58.911 --> 00:38:58.891]  7.
[00:38:59.291 --> 00:39:01.712]  I told her about the 19 supposed hijackers sold.
[00:39:02.145 --> 00:39:06.127]  Some of them have proven to be alive.
[00:39:06.387 --> 00:39:09.469]  All the facts, I just rattled them off like a machine gun.
[00:39:10.149 --> 00:39:12.470]  And she couldn't refute anything I said.
[00:39:13.031 --> 00:39:14.692]  She was just powerless.
[00:39:14.732 --> 00:39:16.012]  She tried to deny everything.
[00:39:16.092 --> 00:39:17.933]  She's like a scientist or something like that.
[00:39:18.634 --> 00:39:25.978]  But the way I look at it, if I get on somebody's what list, so be it.
[00:39:26.058 --> 00:39:26.378]  Because
[00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:31.091]  I'm going to... If I'm going down, I'm going down swinging, you know?
[00:39:31.291 --> 00:39:32.553]  And I'm not going to be afraid.
[00:39:32.613 --> 00:39:33.734]  I'm not going to live in the shadows.
[00:39:33.795 --> 00:39:36.077]  I'm going to... You know, that's just the way I am.
[00:39:36.137 --> 00:39:39.321]  I'm like a bird dog with this instinct for hunting birds.
[00:39:39.442 --> 00:39:40.483]  I just feel compelled...
[00:39:41.409 --> 00:39:43.130]  I'm the same way.
[00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.631]  I mean, there's not even a question of fear.
[00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:47.091]  These people are criminals.
[00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.272]  They must be stood up to.
[00:39:48.332 --> 00:39:53.974]  It's so disgusting to see how many people know what's going on but are afraid to stand up and speak out.
[00:39:54.414 --> 00:40:05.798]  If everybody that knew the truth would stand up, get involved, we have over half the country now in major polls who don't just believe that the government was involved or might have known what happened and let it happen, but carried it out.
[00:40:06.278 --> 00:40:08.219]  We are now beginning to win this fight.
[00:40:08.559 --> 00:40:09.739]  They're on the defensive.
[00:40:09.819 --> 00:40:13.640]  That's why they're attacking us and attacking others and attacking Bill and Avery.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.060]  And that's good news.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.221]  When you're over the target, you're going to get flack.
[00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:17.981]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:20.381]  I really appreciate that call, Mike.
[00:40:20.421 --> 00:40:22.982]  Good to hear you're taking action there in your area.
[00:40:23.002 --> 00:40:25.763]  Eileen and Mash, you're on the air.
[00:40:25.803 --> 00:40:26.163]  Welcome.
[00:40:26.663 --> 00:40:27.483]  Welcome to you.
[00:40:27.903 --> 00:40:30.764]  I'm telling you, I don't know what we'd do without you, Alex.
[00:40:32.904 --> 00:40:34.405]  I'd like to discuss this...
[00:40:36.403 --> 00:40:38.645]  Rayburn building incident.
[00:40:38.745 --> 00:40:58.820]  Yes, the hysterical evacuation here in the land of the cowards, home of the slaves, where a jackhammer goes off so you lock all the schools down and you have total hysteria, and then troops run up to, and they have paramilitary police there, running up to congressmen saying, don't talk to that news camera.
[00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:02.343]  Well, I have a different take on it, I think.
[00:41:03.024 --> 00:41:05.986]  You see, these people have sold out their country
[00:41:07.015 --> 00:41:15.858]  And I think that any kind of noise that would remind them of a gun, whether it does or not, would scare them witless.
[00:41:17.198 --> 00:41:17.859]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:17.879 --> 00:41:19.919]  Yeah, the wicked flee when none pursue.
[00:41:20.179 --> 00:41:20.900]  Exactly.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:26.261]  And I think that's just another indication of how witless they are to begin with.
[00:41:27.762 --> 00:41:29.182]  I've been writing senators.
[00:41:29.242 --> 00:41:30.683]  I've been writing congressmen.
[00:41:31.363 --> 00:41:33.924]  I am a member of your...
[00:41:36.255 --> 00:41:38.516]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:41:39.596 --> 00:41:47.499]  I'm telling you, I've found out more information from you and your website than I have in the last three years anywhere else.
[00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:52.341]  And I just, God bless you, Alex.
[00:41:54.121 --> 00:41:55.181]  Well, I appreciate that.
[00:41:55.201 --> 00:41:56.162]  Anything else on your mind?
[00:41:56.622 --> 00:42:02.584]  No, I just, is there any way, I mean, I know that there are certain ways, but
[00:42:03.456 --> 00:42:06.103]  What can we do to get these people out of there?
[00:42:06.844 --> 00:42:07.566]  They're corrupt.
[00:42:09.699 --> 00:42:14.561]  Well, what you've got is, we're basically like a bull or a buck and bronco horse.
[00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:17.142]  And they're like a cowboy on our back.
[00:42:17.942 --> 00:42:20.563]  And believe me, they've heard all your phone calls.
[00:42:20.603 --> 00:42:21.703]  They've read all your letters.
[00:42:21.763 --> 00:42:23.884]  They know that everybody hates them.
[00:42:23.904 --> 00:42:26.205]  They know that more and more people are getting wise to them.
[00:42:26.665 --> 00:42:28.666]  That's why they're setting this police state up.
[00:42:28.766 --> 00:42:30.927]  They know that we know.
[00:42:30.987 --> 00:42:34.308]  It's like somebody who you invited into your house for the weekend...
[00:42:34.828 --> 00:42:45.013]  And suddenly it's a year later, and they've got you moved out of the master bedroom, sleeping on the couch, and they're telling you to go out and get them a pizza, and you finally just go, you know, I'm sick of you.
[00:42:45.033 --> 00:42:45.733]  Get out of here.
[00:42:46.113 --> 00:42:47.874]  And they're like, no, I'm not going to get out of here.
[00:42:47.894 --> 00:42:50.015]  I'll beat you up.
[00:42:50.315 --> 00:42:51.616]  I'm here taking care of you.
[00:42:52.356 --> 00:42:53.636]  I'm here for your best interest.
[00:42:53.696 --> 00:42:55.057]  No, no, no, no.
[00:42:55.617 --> 00:43:00.639]  And so that's what all the PR and propaganda is about, but it's not working anymore.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.640]  I appreciate your call.
[00:43:02.645 --> 00:43:04.727]  And they do have three different types of propaganda.
[00:43:05.487 --> 00:43:09.631]  They have the pure government propaganda, which they know that no one's buying into anymore.
[00:43:10.151 --> 00:43:13.114]  Then they have the middle propaganda, or what they call gray propaganda.
[00:43:13.134 --> 00:43:16.997]  You have black propaganda, gray propaganda, and white propaganda.
[00:43:17.797 --> 00:43:19.679]  And there's government documents on this.
[00:43:19.699 --> 00:43:22.261]  The CIA in the past would assess the Soviets this way.
[00:43:23.666 --> 00:43:24.046]  We're good to go.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:58.028]  And white propaganda is where they can go out and find a police officer, a doctor, a nurse, a school teacher, to volunteer for Homeland Security or FEMA or any of these other groups, AmeriCorps, Secure Corps.
[00:43:59.185 --> 00:44:01.526]  And then you brainwash them.
[00:44:01.586 --> 00:44:04.288]  You give them just enough of the story where it sounds good.
[00:44:04.628 --> 00:44:05.748]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:09.690]  They don't know what they're part of, a larger, bigger picture.
[00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:15.793]  And then they go out, and their neighbors, their friends, their families believe in them because people have a gauge.
[00:44:15.833 --> 00:44:20.275]  They have a meter, a baloney detector, as they say.
[00:44:21.176 --> 00:44:22.056]  Well, they say something else.
[00:44:22.076 --> 00:44:23.577]  We'll just call it a garbage detector.
[00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:34.895]  But if somebody believes in what they're saying, and they believe they're telling the truth, then it will telegraph to you as true, and you can be fooled by it.
[00:44:35.855 --> 00:44:50.403]  That's why FEMA has recruited hundreds of thousands of preachers, hundreds of thousands of doctors and police officers and other people that the public still trusts to a certain extent to go out and brainwash the public.
[00:44:51.528 --> 00:44:55.791]  That's what's happening right now all over this country.
[00:44:56.491 --> 00:45:00.394]  I'm going to go to Randy and Virginia and others here in a few minutes, but let me just cover this now.
[00:45:01.535 --> 00:45:03.796]  Last Monday, I interviewed a pastor.
[00:45:03.856 --> 00:45:05.317]  We posted the documents.
[00:45:05.417 --> 00:45:08.640]  We posted national documents and local training manuals out of Ohio.
[00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:22.027]  And we posted many other training manuals that are being used by state employees in Virginia and Texas and even what's given to the public where they say constitutionalists are terrorists, homeschoolers are terrorists, property rights activists are terrorists.
[00:45:22.047 --> 00:45:23.268]  I mean, we have phone numbers.
[00:45:23.769 --> 00:45:25.911]  These are real manuals, real flyers.
[00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:26.872]  They have the phone numbers.
[00:45:26.892 --> 00:45:28.133]  They have the agents' names.
[00:45:28.173 --> 00:45:30.496]  They have the document numbers.
[00:45:31.238 --> 00:45:36.579]  I mean, the article we wrote last week about this interview with this pastor was over-documented.
[00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:38.260]  I mean, it was an absolute joke.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:44.902]  How many hyperlinks, how many documents, video clips of FEMA saying all Christians are terrorists in Kansas City.
[00:45:45.282 --> 00:45:49.863]  I mean, everything we claimed was documented.
[00:45:50.003 --> 00:45:51.143]  Doesn't matter to these people.
[00:45:51.763 --> 00:45:53.464]  I mean, I got a couple emails like this.
[00:45:54.684 --> 00:45:58.025]  Reference, secret FEMA plan to use pastors as pacifiers.
[00:45:59.025 --> 00:46:02.007]  And Jack D, he gave his full name, but I won't use it here.
[00:46:02.528 --> 00:46:03.969]  Jack D sent me this email.
[00:46:04.529 --> 00:46:05.770]  I ask you to prove it!
[00:46:06.354 --> 00:46:07.415]  And that's in bold letters.
[00:46:07.835 --> 00:46:14.400]  Anyone can write such an article, but real pastors stand up for the truth and would be telling congregations about this nationwide.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.521]  So far, not a peep.
[00:46:16.161 --> 00:46:17.382]  I am no fan of government.
[00:46:17.862 --> 00:46:30.952]  As my research know, as my readers know, this is some guy's got a website, but I cannot accept unattributed stories such as yours without some eyewitness testimony and other actual proof.
[00:46:31.412 --> 00:46:35.596]  Sometimes the conspiracy exists, and sometimes it exists only in imagination.
[00:46:35.976 --> 00:46:45.004]  Until you can prove the facts of the secret FEMA plan to use pastors as pacifiers, you will be marginalized as a conspiracy nut with success.
[00:46:45.525 --> 00:46:51.950]  Jack, I ought to contact Jack D, and I ought to have this guy on the show.
[00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:56.114]  Hey, Jack D, do you know what hyperlinks are?
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:03.826]  Jack D., it's admitted that FEMA is recruiting pastors and community leaders.
[00:47:04.026 --> 00:47:11.053]  I've had the, what in Knoxville and in other areas of the country, I've had the head of the Alabama Defense Forces on.
[00:47:11.494 --> 00:47:13.996]  They admit that all of this training is going on.
[00:47:15.157 --> 00:47:17.260]  We posted the training manuals.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.423]  We blacked out the names of the very pastors.
[00:47:21.732 --> 00:47:22.513]  I think we're good to go.
[00:47:49.381 --> 00:47:56.366]  In fact, when the mayor announced that and the gun confiscation began, we wrote an article about it and actually got emails saying we were liars.
[00:47:57.347 --> 00:47:58.868]  Didn't matter if we had transcripts.
[00:47:59.108 --> 00:48:01.009]  Didn't matter if we had a transcript from the New York Times.
[00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:03.130]  Didn't even matter if we had video clips.
[00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.931]  It's not real.
[00:48:05.852 --> 00:48:06.713]  That reminds me of 1999.
[00:48:07.573 --> 00:48:13.958]  I went to the massive urban warfare drill there in...
[00:48:15.149 --> 00:48:26.916]  Oakland, California, and witnessed Marines, foreign troops, Dutch, British, others, Israeli, French, training with hundreds of role players who were screaming, I'm an American, please, not the camp, I have rights.
[00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:32.359]  We have the fake interrogations on video, that they were doing these little war games, where are you from?
[00:48:32.419 --> 00:48:33.340]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.720]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:36.862]  What militia are you part of?
[00:48:37.422 --> 00:48:40.784]  And I came back and put that on TV locally, and I showed that to the world,
[00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.772]  And hundreds of times I received emails.
[00:48:44.252 --> 00:48:45.653]  I was confronted on the street.
[00:48:46.314 --> 00:48:52.018]  People told me that I hired the USS Coronado, almost as big as an aircraft carrier.
[00:48:52.038 --> 00:48:53.519]  I hired the helicopters.
[00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:55.420]  I hired the tanks in downtown Oakland.
[00:48:55.681 --> 00:48:56.401]  It's all lies.
[00:48:57.022 --> 00:48:58.383]  No, it's not all lies.
[00:48:58.743 --> 00:48:59.343]  It's the truth.
[00:48:59.624 --> 00:49:02.886]  You can go to the Marine Corps' own website and read about those drills.
[00:49:03.266 --> 00:49:05.248]  I don't know what your major malfunction is.
[00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:07.249]  I don't know what's wrong with you.
[00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:09.271]  But you would deny...
[00:49:10.376 --> 00:49:13.441]  A Mack truck when it was 10 feet away from you about to run you over.
[00:49:14.823 --> 00:49:18.568]  Yes, FEMA is training to confiscate your guns.
[00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:24.477]  The NRA is trying to pass laws, quote, banning gun confiscation during emergencies.
[00:49:24.537 --> 00:49:25.599]  Are they delusional too?
[00:49:26.647 --> 00:49:27.407]  We're good to go.
[00:49:48.499 --> 00:49:49.300]  You dingbat?
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.720]  You're in denial.
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.902]  Wanton, willful denial.
[00:49:53.182 --> 00:49:54.903]  And I am sick of people like you.
[00:49:55.243 --> 00:49:56.463]  You make me angry.
[00:49:56.704 --> 00:50:00.065]  It's people like you that are going to kill this country, buddy.
[00:50:02.047 --> 00:50:05.368]  Because you claim you know about the New World Order, but we're making stuff up.
[00:50:05.408 --> 00:50:13.873]  It's like we go show an urban warfare training camp in Mississippi or Louisiana, and then you go visit it and go, well, they say that's a training facility.
[00:50:16.434 --> 00:50:17.295]  It's not a camp.
[00:50:18.211 --> 00:50:22.753]  Well, of course they're going to tell you a fully-furbished set-up camp is for training.
[00:50:23.293 --> 00:50:25.954]  And that's what they're using at dual use for, you maroon.
[00:50:25.974 --> 00:50:32.716]  I mean, I just... There's no way to get the facts across to some of you people.
[00:50:33.737 --> 00:50:36.118]  It doesn't matter how documented it is.
[00:50:36.778 --> 00:50:37.698]  It doesn't matter.
[00:50:37.778 --> 00:50:47.422]  It just... I mean, are you going to deny it when they're kicking your door down for your guns or saying you've got to come turn your guns in for food?
[00:50:48.294 --> 00:50:53.260]  When there's some big nuke attack or bio attack, I mean, you'll make excuses then, won't you?
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.723]  We'll come back, talk to Randy and others.
[00:50:56.184 --> 00:50:57.786]  Infowars.com is the website.

[00:51:30.331 --> 00:51:34.755]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.975 --> 00:51:42.202]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:54:15.607 --> 00:54:16.467]  You deny it.
[00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:21.329]  Faced with George Bush having the Senate pass total blanket amnesty?
[00:54:21.389 --> 00:54:22.089]  You deny it.
[00:54:22.749 --> 00:54:25.130]  Faced with the BATF being doubled in size?
[00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.930]  You deny it.
[00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:31.311]  Faced with the American Union forming right in front of you even when Lou Dobbs admits it?
[00:54:31.732 --> 00:54:32.412]  You deny it.
[00:54:32.952 --> 00:54:35.553]  You deny it no matter how bad it is.
[00:54:36.433 --> 00:54:37.633]  Well, I'm not denying it.
[00:54:38.033 --> 00:54:39.894]  I'm facing what we're up against.
[00:54:40.894 --> 00:54:44.315]  We're going to go to Randy, Chris, Cheryl, Robert, Annette, and others.

[00:55:39.071 --> 00:55:41.632]  Let's go ahead and go to Randy in Virginia.
[00:55:41.712 --> 00:55:42.652]  Randy, you're on the air.
[00:55:43.843 --> 00:55:48.146]  Yeah, Alex, you bring up some of these emails these people send you where they don't believe things.
[00:55:48.166 --> 00:55:59.254]  That reminded me of the Oklahoma City bombing where, live on the news that day, they were, you know, after the original bomb, so-called, had went off, and then, you know, they were working to get people out.
[00:55:59.374 --> 00:56:02.656]  They had the governor, the police video of them removing the bombs.
[00:56:02.996 --> 00:56:03.196]  Right.
[00:56:04.217 --> 00:56:05.138]  The other multiple bombs.
[00:56:05.158 --> 00:56:10.341]  And then if you tell people that, they just totally, they say, well, you can't believe everything you see.
[00:56:10.361 --> 00:56:11.362]  So I think they're implying that
[00:56:12.318 --> 00:56:15.580]  I don't know, maybe you went and filmed that on your own and staged it or something.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:20.943]  Well, then they doubled back and said, well, you can't believe the mainstream media, but then they believed the official report.
[00:56:21.263 --> 00:56:21.524]  Right.
[00:56:22.304 --> 00:56:31.730]  I wanted to ask you, I was going to ask you about this Pentagon video, but you brought up the FEMA program with the pastors, something I'm pretty interested in.
[00:56:33.651 --> 00:56:35.572]  What should we do when we see an article like that?
[00:56:36.413 --> 00:56:40.035]  Can we call into our local newspaper and ask them about that, and can they run a story on that?
[00:56:40.075 --> 00:56:40.455]  Or how would you...
[00:56:40.902 --> 00:56:41.763]  How would you go about doing that?
[00:56:42.063 --> 00:56:47.309]  Well, yeah, I would go around to the preachers and say, are you part of this program in 13,000 counties?
[00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:48.991]  Right.
[00:56:49.011 --> 00:56:59.262]  13,000 plus counties, and then we've got the federal documents where they admit that they're recruiting the pastors, quote, for emergencies, and then we've gotten the internal training manuals that they use
[00:56:59.782 --> 00:57:00.262]  We're good to go.
[00:57:25.009 --> 00:57:25.369]  Exactly.
[00:57:25.389 --> 00:57:25.670]  Exactly.
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:55.741]  I wanted to ask you about this.
[00:57:55.981 --> 00:58:04.325]  I know you don't like to major on this little Pentagon video, but I got to thinking about some of this eyewitness testimony, particularly this guy.
[00:58:04.345 --> 00:58:05.846]  His name is Frank Probst.
[00:58:05.866 --> 00:58:07.186]  I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:58:07.386 --> 00:58:11.068]  Yeah, a lot of them are defense intelligence, CIA.
[00:58:11.228 --> 00:58:13.910]  Pentagon renovation worker and retired Army officer.
[00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:14.590]  It goes on down.
[00:58:15.651 --> 00:58:16.592]  He said the plane was coming in.
[00:58:16.632 --> 00:58:17.773]  He said he dove to his right.
[00:58:17.933 --> 00:58:20.635]  The engine passed on one side of him about six feet away.
[00:58:21.096 --> 00:58:25.279]  And he saw people in the windows, which at 500 miles an hour is impossible.
[00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:25.859]  Right.
[00:58:26.199 --> 00:58:26.780]  Just wondering.
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.242]  Well, he says this great big engine from this beautiful airplane just vaporized.
[00:58:30.923 --> 00:58:33.025]  I'm wondering, are we supposed to be able to see any of that on these videos?
[00:58:33.245 --> 00:58:37.848]  Are there people diving out of the way and that sort of thing?
[00:58:37.908 --> 00:58:39.429]  We're meant to debate it endlessly.
[00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:40.050]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.778 --> 00:58:45.679]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.999 --> 00:58:46.799]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.819 --> 00:58:47.359]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.399 --> 00:58:48.399]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.439 --> 00:58:49.540]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:54.781]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.261 --> 00:58:56.741]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.073 --> 00:59:09.996]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:14.379]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.083]  We've got senior former CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush Jr.
[00:59:19.103 --> 00:59:21.725]  joining us coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:22.265 --> 00:59:25.308]  Articles here, data indicates Border Patrol buildups ineffective.
[00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:26.609]  They were designed to be that way.
[00:59:29.372 --> 00:59:33.793]  We also have reports here, babies aborted for not being perfect in England.
[00:59:33.833 --> 00:59:36.154]  This is becoming more and more widespread.
[00:59:36.214 --> 00:59:39.154]  Right now, let's go to some more of your calls than Ray McGovern.
[00:59:39.655 --> 00:59:46.376]  And by the way, John, just so we have it when McGovern joins us, find the last John Stewart piece we heard about two weeks ago where he talks about Ray McGovern.
[00:59:46.396 --> 00:59:48.177]  I want to play that clip coming in.
[00:59:48.937 --> 00:59:52.358]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Philadelphia.
[00:59:52.698 --> 00:59:53.438]  Chris, welcome.
[00:59:54.339 --> 00:59:55.039]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:59:55.119 --> 01:00:00.741]  I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener, and an owner of 75% of your information.
[01:00:02.022 --> 01:00:05.323]  I'd just like to say good job, and I'll be really brief.
[01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.484]  I got three points and a question.
[01:00:09.004 --> 01:00:15.686]  The first point being, I want you to elaborate off-air, is the Malthus Principle of population control.
[01:00:16.506 --> 01:00:22.548]  And the second point is the Hegelian dialect and the materialistic dialect.
[01:00:23.443 --> 01:00:29.105]  And the question is, what about organization of the militias?
[01:00:29.165 --> 01:00:37.367]  I heard your comments on Friday, and the guy was saying we had to do this through peaceful means, and I just don't think that's possible.
[01:00:37.887 --> 01:00:42.768]  And I'd like to see you have some, you know, like real reputable militia guys on your show.
[01:00:43.529 --> 01:00:46.469]  And I have another point to make about male tampering.
[01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:52.431]  David J. Smith's stuff that's been going out to his people has been getting tampered with.
[01:00:52.987 --> 01:00:55.370]  My boss had his envelope opened by the U.S.
[01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:57.953]  Postal Service and said, sorry, we opened your mail.
[01:00:58.474 --> 01:00:59.515]  I never got that one.
[01:00:59.535 --> 01:01:03.861]  I had to call back David J. Smith's wife and she sent me out another one.
[01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:06.484]  That too was open, but at least I got this one.
[01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:09.598]  Well, they admit now they searched the mail.
[01:01:09.738 --> 01:01:11.940]  Again, we always heard about Russia and China.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.002]  Now we live under that, but the border stays wide open.
[01:01:15.563 --> 01:01:16.524]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:01:16.544 --> 01:01:21.227]  I mean, you said short, and these are all great comments and questions.
[01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:25.371]  Let me go ahead and start trying to address the issues you brought up.
[01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:26.992]  But first off, anything else you want to add?
[01:01:27.032 --> 01:01:29.594]  I'd like to tell you two, Alex.
[01:01:29.734 --> 01:01:34.578]  In Norristown, Montgomery County, they set up an oligarchy, and this is in Pennsylvania.
[01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:39.636]  They admit they're not going to have a mayor anymore because the mayor squandered the money.
[01:01:40.036 --> 01:01:44.939]  Now a four-person city council is going to run Morristown Borough out there.
[01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:50.622]  Oh, yes, you've gone into economic crisis, so a private consortium will have to run things now?
[01:01:51.362 --> 01:01:53.903]  Well, the city council, made up of four members.
[01:01:54.744 --> 01:02:01.447]  And the other report is Homeland Security was in the vicinity of Philadelphia International Airport.
[01:02:02.133 --> 01:02:06.679]  They had our perimeter set up, and that was about a month ago, so I'd just like to report that to you.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:07.560]  Thank you.
[01:02:07.961 --> 01:02:08.902]  I appreciate the call.
[01:02:09.964 --> 01:02:15.931]  Lord Malthus, he came up with this idea, what was it, like 200 years ago, 170 years ago, I forget, I've read about him, but
[01:02:19.142 --> 01:02:35.013]  The point is, is he said that the people are basically scum, that who cares if they die in factories, or who cares if they starve to death, that the elite has a right to rule over them, and there's too many people, and so just don't even take care of the population, they're basically worthless.
[01:02:35.553 --> 01:03:00.309]  And that grew in the next hundred years into social Darwinism, saying it's the elite's right to be abusive and evil and do bad things to us, because it's their social Darwinistic view that it's selective development with evolution, and that they're actually helping the earth by being ruthless, and because they are ruthless, that gives them a right to rule, and it just goes on and on.
[01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.270]  So that's the Malthusian theory there.
[01:03:04.431 --> 01:03:05.811]  As it is known.
[01:03:06.672 --> 01:03:08.032]  And you had a bunch of other questions.
[01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:10.653]  There were so many I couldn't keep track of all of them.
[01:03:10.693 --> 01:03:14.714]  But we're going to go to break now and come back with Ray McGovern.
[01:03:15.114 --> 01:03:21.215]  I mean, the whole Malthusian theory fits nicely into Dr. Pianca here at UT Austin saying 90% of us need to die.
[01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:22.596]  The dying needs to start now.
[01:03:22.976 --> 01:03:24.476]  He's ready for his family to die.
[01:03:24.836 --> 01:03:26.556]  It's sad, but he's ready to go first.
[01:03:27.177 --> 01:03:28.517]  And then his own students write...
[01:03:29.498 --> 01:03:32.359]  It's not that they want power, they're just trying to save the earth.
[01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:33.979]  It's a rationale for total control.
[01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:57.820]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.369]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:04.873 --> 01:04:06.974]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:04:07.054 --> 01:04:09.776]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:04:10.116 --> 01:04:14.338]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.398 --> 01:04:21.322]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.462 --> 01:04:23.483]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.863 --> 01:04:34.168]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.468 --> 01:04:39.851]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:04:40.351 --> 01:04:42.992]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:04:43.092 --> 01:04:43.853]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.873 --> 01:04:44.253]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.273 --> 01:04:45.394]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.323 --> 01:05:04.056]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:04.237 --> 01:05:11.766]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.046 --> 01:05:15.211]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:05:15.491 --> 01:05:21.220]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:27.650]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:31.892]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:05:31.952 --> 01:05:33.853]  The water level is always visible.
[01:05:34.033 --> 01:05:39.977]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:40.217 --> 01:05:44.159]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:53.439 --> 01:05:53.879]  We're good to go.
[01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:12.111]  We're good to go.
[01:06:27.756 --> 01:06:28.116]  We're good to go.
[01:06:28.136 --> 01:06:28.556]  We're good to go.
[01:06:28.576 --> 01:06:28.957]  We're good to go.
[01:06:57.913 --> 01:06:58.553]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.213 --> 01:07:00.273]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.974 --> 01:07:02.094]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.754 --> 01:07:03.555]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.315 --> 01:07:05.835]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:09.837]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.057 --> 01:07:14.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.039 --> 01:07:19.260]  The criminal neocons know their time is short.
[01:07:20.921 --> 01:07:22.001]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:07:22.021 --> 01:07:24.182]  They've just got to keep pumping up the bubble.
[01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.631]  Or it'll pop, it'll burst and float in on them.
[01:07:28.291 --> 01:07:40.573]  So to cover up all the past corruption and bid rigging and all the war profiteering and the domestic corruption, they just hurdle forward headlong saying, no, no, no, we're dictators.
[01:07:41.013 --> 01:07:42.073]  We're above the law.
[01:07:42.613 --> 01:07:44.073]  And so we're turning up the heat.
[01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:51.935]  I'm here on Memorial Day, Ray McGovern, senior CIA analyst, advisor to Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr., and others in the agency 27 years.
[01:07:53.215 --> 01:07:53.976]  We're good to go.
[01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:15.672]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:16.713]  I never said that.
[01:08:44.005 --> 01:08:45.386]  So let's play this little clip.
[01:08:45.446 --> 01:08:48.848]  And notice how the media responded and attacked McGovern.
[01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:55.853]  Attacked McGovern for simply saying the emperor has no clothes.
[01:08:56.133 --> 01:09:00.496]  So let's roll this clip and we'll be joined by a great American patriot, Ray McGovern.
[01:09:00.516 --> 01:09:01.536]  Here it is.
[01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:02.337]  Comedic gag.
[01:09:03.477 --> 01:09:05.859]  Honestly, any time Zarqawi releases a tape, it's news.
[01:09:06.379 --> 01:09:08.821]  But sometimes, it just happens.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:10.341]  How is that covered?
[01:09:10.441 --> 01:09:15.325]  For example, last week in Atlanta, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was giving a speech.
[01:09:15.605 --> 01:09:23.331]  When he was suddenly interrupted, there was Screaming Lady, and then of course Screaming Fellow also joined in, and then Screaming Lady with War Crimes Back.
[01:09:24.592 --> 01:09:31.077]  Typical, easily dismissed crackpots, doing the same old... Wait, I'm sorry sir, you had a question?
[01:09:31.773 --> 01:09:36.054]  I'm Ray McGovern, a 27-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:09:36.514 --> 01:09:43.256]  Why did you lie to get us into a war that was not necessary and that has caused these kinds of casualties?
[01:09:43.796 --> 01:09:44.456]  Ruh-roh.
[01:09:44.477 --> 01:09:47.217]  First of all, I haven't lied.
[01:09:48.218 --> 01:09:48.338]  Oh!
[01:09:48.798 --> 01:09:49.498]  He didn't lie!
[01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:51.598]  All right, well, that settles it, everybody.
[01:09:51.638 --> 01:09:52.599]  There's pound cake in the back.
[01:09:52.619 --> 01:09:54.319]  We can all have a nice time.
[01:09:54.479 --> 01:09:59.241]  It appears that there were not weapons of mass destruction there.
[01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:00.761]  You said you knew where they were.
[01:10:01.835 --> 01:10:02.356]  I did not.
[01:10:03.336 --> 01:10:03.557]  See?
[01:10:03.577 --> 01:10:08.120]  He never said he knew where they were.
[01:10:08.841 --> 01:10:09.702]  We know where they are.
[01:10:09.782 --> 01:10:24.735]  They're in the area around Chick-fil-A and Baghdad and East, West, South and North.
[01:10:25.355 --> 01:10:28.298]  Well, to be fair, Rumsfeld probably never saw that episode of Meet the Press.
[01:10:32.026 --> 01:10:37.752]  So the Secretary of Defense caught in a contradiction about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:10:38.933 --> 01:10:41.115]  Surely that will be a big story.
[01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.073]  How much of an axe do you have to grind with Secretary Rumsfeld?
[01:10:45.213 --> 01:10:46.754]  But he wasn't just any heckler.
[01:10:46.774 --> 01:10:47.495]  Were you nervous?
[01:10:47.835 --> 01:10:49.737]  Tucker, I resent the word heckler.
[01:10:49.977 --> 01:10:51.178]  I'd like you to take that back.
[01:10:51.358 --> 01:10:52.539]  Okay, I'm not taking it back.
[01:10:52.919 --> 01:10:57.964]  Rumsfeld encouraged whoever, I think, had their hands on you at the time to let you stay there.
[01:10:58.044 --> 01:10:59.465]  Does he get any credit for that today?
[01:10:59.485 --> 01:11:01.507]  Isn't it enough that he was wrong and had bad judgment?
[01:11:01.567 --> 01:11:02.628]  Why does he have to be a liar, too?
[01:11:03.168 --> 01:11:05.690]  Well, you know, that's the question you have to direct to him.
[01:11:06.551 --> 01:11:07.232]  But won't.
[01:11:09.375 --> 01:11:13.536]  To be fair, one news network was able to question Rumsfeld personally.
[01:11:13.556 --> 01:11:15.056]  No holds barred.
[01:11:15.656 --> 01:11:19.337]  So when you hear people say, we won the war, but we lost the peace.
[01:11:19.777 --> 01:11:20.778]  Oh, that's nonsense.
[01:11:20.858 --> 01:11:24.338]  So it's your way or the highway is not true.
[01:11:24.779 --> 01:11:27.099]  It is so wrong, it's just unbelievable.
[01:11:28.199 --> 01:11:31.020]  Mmm, that's some good old-fashioned muck polishing.
[01:11:32.299 --> 01:11:39.374]  Yes, as Iraq continues to spiral out of control and criticism of Rumsfeld grows, Fox News decided it was time to take an in-depth look at the issue.
[01:11:44.835 --> 01:11:46.156]  Yes, why he fights.
[01:11:46.217 --> 01:11:51.842]  An hour-long, unvestigative report into the real Donald Rumsfeld, hosted by Necklace Johnson.
[01:11:52.403 --> 01:11:56.867]  He wears a pedometer on his belt to count every step he takes every day.
[01:11:57.088 --> 01:12:00.871]  But even for a former college wrestler who still did one-arm push-ups.
[01:12:01.072 --> 01:12:05.076]  People magazine named him one of the sexiest men.
[01:12:09.293 --> 01:12:09.713]  Wow!
[01:12:09.873 --> 01:12:11.034]  One of the year's sexiest men!
[01:12:11.214 --> 01:12:14.656]  I believe, though, that was a pretty off year for sexy men.
[01:12:16.296 --> 01:12:18.738]  If I remember correctly, that was the year Tom Bosley won.
[01:12:19.098 --> 01:12:31.564]  So, it didn't... Now, the special did include interviews with Rumsfeld critic General Paul Van Riper, one of the officers who had called for Rumsfeld's resignation.
[01:12:31.864 --> 01:12:34.245]  I'm sure there'll be no change in the reporter's inflection.
[01:12:35.001 --> 01:12:36.922]  What are you trying to accomplish by doing this?
[01:12:37.262 --> 01:12:42.925]  And you don't think this debate threatens the civilian leadership of the military?
[01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.686]  Does that hurt the war effort?
[01:12:48.547 --> 01:12:51.869]  I can't tell if I'm smelling the fairness or the balance.
[01:12:53.389 --> 01:12:57.491]  But ultimately, why he fights could only end with why.
[01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:01.393]  That is a piece of the airplane.
[01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:03.950]  Wonderful.
[01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:05.992]  Couldn't have gone with stark or vivid or effective.
[01:13:06.112 --> 01:13:07.133]  It's almost like you're enjoying this.
[01:13:07.333 --> 01:13:08.514]  We'll be right back.
[01:13:22.094 --> 01:13:27.097]  You said you knew where they were, near Tikrit, near Baghdad, and northeast, south, and west of there.
[01:13:27.177 --> 01:13:28.138]  Those are your words.
[01:13:28.298 --> 01:13:33.842]  They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south, and north somewhat.
[01:13:34.842 --> 01:13:38.205]  All right, Ray McGovern, thanks for sitting through that on this Memorial Day.
[01:13:38.245 --> 01:13:39.726]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[01:13:41.455 --> 01:13:43.697]  First time I heard the whole thing.
[01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:52.143]  Well, right out of the gates, will you respond to what happened in that meeting up in Virginia and then the media firestorm that erupted?
[01:13:52.984 --> 01:13:54.505]  Actually, it was down in Atlanta.
[01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:57.347]  It was completely serendipitous.
[01:13:57.427 --> 01:14:03.052]  I was down there for a totally different reason, and when I heard he was coming down to give a lecture, I...
[01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:18.366]  I had to use some of my old tradecraft to wangle a ticket, but I invested $40, and that still stings, by the way, and got into his lecture and sat near the microphone that would be used for questions and answers.
[01:14:18.967 --> 01:14:33.779]  So it was fortuitous, and I guess what really turned me on or off, depending on how you look at it, Alex, is when one of those ladies who was protesting said, you know, you've told a lot of lies, you've told a lot of lies, and
[01:14:34.827 --> 01:15:02.621]  And Rumsfeld, you've probably seen him do this, he sort of wrung his hands and said, gosh, you know, when people accuse the President of telling lies, I just, you know, she didn't accuse the President of telling lies, she accused Rumsfeld, but he went on and he said, that is just so corrosive, so destructive of the trust that is necessary for government to work.
[01:15:03.142 --> 01:15:03.722]  It's just so
[01:15:04.381 --> 01:15:05.181]  So wrong.
[01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:07.042]  And then he went on to the next question.
[01:15:07.082 --> 01:15:17.387]  I said to myself, oh my goodness, you know, I have to ask some question of him just to throw his words back on him and show that he's the consummate liar.
[01:15:18.624 --> 01:15:23.728]  As luck would have it, I got second in line and was able to do that on live TV.
[01:15:24.108 --> 01:15:45.065]  Now let's be clear, and you're right, Atlanta, you're there, there are people who are standing up saying things, but you're in the line to ask questions, that's why you're mic'd, that's why we can hear you, but then some of the media tried to imply that you were a heckler, when in reality you were there asking questions, and then security came over and was basically telling you to knock it off.
[01:15:45.085 --> 01:15:47.727]  Can you go over what actually happened there?
[01:15:48.227 --> 01:15:48.648]  Sure, yeah.
[01:15:48.668 --> 01:15:52.351]  I was not heckling, of course.
[01:15:52.771 --> 01:15:57.996]  I was in line, and he came to me, called on me, and you heard how I started.
[01:16:00.138 --> 01:16:11.868]  After I got into it, and he seemed to be getting a little bit uncharacteristically unnerved, this big guy comes down with a white coat, a white coat actually,
[01:16:12.483 --> 01:16:13.944]  And a black baseball cap.
[01:16:14.244 --> 01:16:27.174]  And since he knew the cameras were coming well from the back, he placed himself around and in front of me, put his elbow in my solar plexus and started driving me out of the arena.
[01:16:27.194 --> 01:16:30.756]  And that's when I cried out, this is America.
[01:16:31.317 --> 01:16:36.300]  And when Rumsfeld saw that, he had an instant decision to make.
[01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:40.263]  And he made the right one from his point of view.
[01:16:40.283 --> 01:16:41.444]  I mean, it just would have been
[01:16:42.321 --> 01:16:53.387]  Pretty bad PR to have someone who is simply asking him a question, which he already lied about, to be sort of carried out of this conference.
[01:16:53.427 --> 01:17:03.333]  Bush had me kidnapped at a press conference for asking a question he didn't like, and he directed them, they grabbed me, they put me in the police car, drove me around for an hour, threw me out on the side of the highway.
[01:17:03.393 --> 01:17:09.757]  So this has been going on for a while, but what does it say about the mentality that you're in line to ask a question
[01:17:10.477 --> 01:17:16.702]  And Rumsfeld hasn't even told them to grab you, but still they're physically manhandling you.
[01:17:16.942 --> 01:17:26.850]  Well, somebody pointed out, some very acute observer, that Rumsfeld did sort of give a little wink to the back of the room when he got into a little bit of trouble with me.
[01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:27.971]  Yeah, that's what Bush did with me.
[01:17:28.191 --> 01:17:29.932]  Yeah, they look at him and then look at you.
[01:17:29.952 --> 01:17:31.954]  Yeah, and then the guy came down.
[01:17:31.974 --> 01:17:36.077]  And then when Rumsfeld saw the choice here, had me carried out,
[01:17:37.267 --> 01:17:40.731]  Or try to persist a little bit and put me down.
[01:17:41.672 --> 01:17:49.262]  He, of course, is the champion Princeton debater, and he exuded this confidence and said, oh, no, no, no, let him stay for a second.
[01:17:50.023 --> 01:17:52.866]  And thankfully, that second expanded into two more minutes.
[01:17:54.631 --> 01:17:55.932]  Well, they've got a problem.
[01:17:56.112 --> 01:18:01.096]  No one that I know, and the polls show this, is buying their baloney anymore, Ray McGovern.
[01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.857]  And so the credibility gap is there.
[01:18:04.278 --> 01:18:08.781]  Bush is plunging down to 28 percentage points, which is a record.
[01:18:08.801 --> 01:18:10.002]  Where do you see this going?
[01:18:11.163 --> 01:18:20.349]  Well, just focusing on Rumsfeld, you know, none other than pundit Jim Hoagland, no liberal heath.
[01:18:21.164 --> 01:18:26.122]  has pointed out that when Rumsfeld runs into difficulty, he expands the problem of
[01:18:27.257 --> 01:18:29.078]  And that's what I worry about.
[01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:32.559]  I worry about Iran, which seems to be next on their agenda.
[01:18:33.079 --> 01:18:36.920]  Doesn't make any sense, but neither did Iraq.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.721]  Yeah, let's talk about Olbert coming here.
[01:18:40.181 --> 01:18:42.121]  We've got Blair coming to the U.S.
[01:18:42.221 --> 01:18:43.702]  They're having the war councils.
[01:18:44.122 --> 01:18:47.403]  And we talked about that Ponzi scheme always inflating it.
[01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:49.743]  The next crisis to cover the last.
[01:18:50.064 --> 01:18:51.364]  We'll be right back with Ray McGovern.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:57.542]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.163 --> 01:18:59.905]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.092 --> 01:19:08.960]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.823]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:11.803 --> 01:19:13.224]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.385 --> 01:19:20.292]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:20.592 --> 01:19:23.575]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:23.915 --> 01:19:24.415]  We're good to go.
[01:19:53.607 --> 01:19:54.048]  Gold.
[01:19:54.388 --> 01:19:55.669]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:55.929 --> 01:20:02.015]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:02.216 --> 01:20:06.039]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.282]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:08.322 --> 01:20:10.624]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:10.764 --> 01:20:17.551]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and weaker.
[01:20:18.171 --> 01:20:21.855]  Call Midas Resources today and ask for your free copy of As Good As Gold.

[01:20:54.733 --> 01:20:55.754]  The war on terrorism.
[01:20:56.094 --> 01:20:58.877]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:59.138 --> 01:21:03.302]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:03.722 --> 01:21:04.563]  So what do you do?
[01:21:04.883 --> 01:21:09.448]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:09.929 --> 01:21:12.050]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:27.234]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:21:27.274 --> 01:21:34.336]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:21:34.696 --> 01:21:34.916]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.677]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:21:53.393 --> 01:22:00.259]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:22:00.399 --> 01:22:13.330]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:15.292]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:15.832]  We're good to go.
[01:22:34.682 --> 01:22:35.262]  Welcome back.
[01:22:35.342 --> 01:22:36.002]  We can't back down.
[01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:03.318]  From the neocon agenda.
[01:23:03.338 --> 01:23:08.480]  I mean, this is a real attempt to take our country over, use it as an engine of world domination.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:13.883]  They admit that themselves, Ray McGovern Sr., retired CIA analyst, worked for Reagan and Bush and many others.
[01:23:14.683 --> 01:23:18.725]  Mr. McGovern, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, plenty of time to get into details, but...
[01:23:19.515 --> 01:23:21.077]  No one wants to attack Iran.
[01:23:21.317 --> 01:23:24.781]  That is the people, but they seem to have now gotten more of the Europeans on board.
[01:23:24.841 --> 01:23:28.205]  The Chinese and Russians aren't right now, but I wouldn't count on that.
[01:23:28.325 --> 01:23:31.028]  Israel, Obert was here, as you know, last week.
[01:23:31.328 --> 01:23:35.192]  They're talking about attacking, even if we don't, but trying to draw us in.
[01:23:35.713 --> 01:23:40.358]  Blair's running around announcing a new doctrine of preemptive policy.
[01:23:40.758 --> 01:23:42.378]  Progressivism is what he calls it.
[01:23:42.859 --> 01:23:45.499]  I think these nuts are really going to try to do it.
[01:23:46.319 --> 01:23:49.760]  Can you give us, in a nutshell, the analysis of what's driving this?
[01:23:51.381 --> 01:23:53.181]  I think I can, Alex.
[01:23:53.221 --> 01:23:54.882]  I've been thinking a lot about this here.
[01:23:56.502 --> 01:24:01.503]  First off, people who say this is a crazy thing to do are absolutely right.
[01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:08.625]  They must realize, though, that the crazy filter is not applied to decisions like this by the White House.
[01:24:10.277 --> 01:24:12.098]  What's happening here is that the U.S.
[01:24:12.178 --> 01:24:13.978]  and Israel are using each other.
[01:24:17.099 --> 01:24:28.562]  Bush and company, in their vision, which is well explained in the Project for the New American Century documents, are determined to dominate that part of the world.
[01:24:29.142 --> 01:24:38.165]  And it's kind of hard just to say, hey, we're the sole remaining superpower of the world, and so we're just going to do what we have to to dominate the part of the world.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:46.725]  What they think they need to do more cleverly is to say, our ally, Israel... Of course, Israel is not our ally.
[01:24:46.745 --> 01:24:48.647]  I hope your listeners know that.
[01:24:48.707 --> 01:24:50.908]  There is no defense treaty with Israel.
[01:24:51.368 --> 01:24:56.812]  Our ally, Israel, is in danger from nuclear weapons being delivered by Iran.
[01:24:57.252 --> 01:25:02.396]  It doesn't matter that they're seven years off of a nuclear weapon, but this is the argument.
[01:25:02.816 --> 01:25:07.099]  And so it's much easier for the Bush regime to say, look...
[01:25:07.819 --> 01:25:13.364]  This is a matter of a mutual security obligation of which there exists none.
[01:25:14.064 --> 01:25:17.607]  And we need to spring to Israel's defense.
[01:25:18.348 --> 01:25:24.613]  Of course, Congress is beholden to all that money they get from the Israel lobby and specifically AIPAC.
[01:25:24.713 --> 01:25:35.282]  And so, just as they did with Iraq in writing letters to the president, we need regime change in Iraq, they're doing the same thing now for regime change in Iran.
[01:25:36.417 --> 01:25:40.259]  Now, as far as the Israelis are concerned, this is great for them.
[01:25:40.279 --> 01:25:45.222]  None of the usual obligations of a mutual defense treaty.
[01:25:45.802 --> 01:25:48.924]  They don't even have to tell us when they take off after another country.
[01:25:49.551 --> 01:26:02.555]  And more than that, they get a mutual defense treaty in reality because the President, as he has three times in the last couple of months, keeps referring to Israel as our ally, to whom we are obligated to spring to their defense.
[01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:06.236]  Well, Ray McGovern, isn't it really a mutual attack treaty?
[01:26:06.336 --> 01:26:14.258]  Because Israel's saying they're going to probably go ahead and attack Iran, and then I see people in the Knesset every week criticizing the U.S.
[01:26:14.578 --> 01:26:16.339]  for not already attacking them.
[01:26:16.379 --> 01:26:17.559]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:26:17.959 --> 01:26:21.980]  Yeah, the question is whether they have the capability of doing the job themselves.
[01:26:22.401 --> 01:26:28.763]  Most of the folks I talk to indicate that they do not, that they need some U.S.
[01:26:28.803 --> 01:26:29.263]  support.
[01:26:30.123 --> 01:26:34.405]  And what will happen, of course, is whether the Israelis start it on their own...
[01:26:35.692 --> 01:26:36.173]  Or not.
[01:26:37.133 --> 01:26:43.960]  The President has set things up to indicate to the American people that we are duty-bound to help the Israelis no matter what happens.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.983]  What about Seymour Hersh's reports and other foreign reports?
[01:26:47.463 --> 01:26:54.409]  I've found Hersh to be very credible in the past that special forces have been there sneaking around for a year surveilling targets.
[01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:57.372]  Alex, not only special forces.
[01:26:58.593 --> 01:26:58.713]  U.S.
[01:26:58.773 --> 01:26:59.274]  Marines.
[01:26:59.294 --> 01:27:00.135]  Okay.
[01:27:00.155 --> 01:27:00.315]  Okay.
[01:27:01.068 --> 01:27:01.228]  U.S.
[01:27:01.268 --> 01:27:11.852]  Marines and Special Forces ordered there by the same Donald Rumsfeld without any congressional authorization, without any specific decision memorandum.
[01:27:11.912 --> 01:27:13.852]  But think about what a provocation that is.
[01:27:13.952 --> 01:27:16.693]  Iran knows that we've got troops in their country.
[01:27:16.753 --> 01:27:18.534]  Imagine if they were doing this to us.
[01:27:18.974 --> 01:27:19.954]  Yeah, of course they know.
[01:27:19.974 --> 01:27:24.476]  As a matter of fact, they've captured some of the minority folks that are cooperating with these troops.
[01:27:25.036 --> 01:27:25.676]  So they're ready.
[01:27:26.057 --> 01:27:27.117]  They're ready for action.
[01:27:27.697 --> 01:27:30.278]  They're hoping against hope that we won't do it.
[01:27:31.033 --> 01:27:31.533]  Oh my gosh!
[01:27:31.673 --> 01:27:32.113]  Oh my gosh!
[01:27:53.917 --> 01:28:03.040]  And then we add this fake story, totally manufactured about making Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians wear pieces of cloth, including yellow for Jews.
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.521]  Turns out it was completely and totally made up.
[01:28:06.981 --> 01:28:13.203]  Even the Jewish member of the Mullahs or of their ruling council there said it's total propaganda.
[01:28:13.283 --> 01:28:16.384]  It's like the babies and the incubators.
[01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:18.345]  Yeah, they're in Kuwait.
[01:28:18.645 --> 01:28:19.005]  Stay there.
[01:28:19.825 --> 01:28:20.286]  Stay there, sir.
[01:28:20.306 --> 01:28:21.426]  I want to get your analysis on that.
[01:28:21.747 --> 01:28:22.888]  How the attack will come down.
[01:28:23.028 --> 01:28:24.869]  What Iran is going to do.
[01:28:24.949 --> 01:28:30.533]  Because they're considering it an act of premeditated aggression if Iran fights back.
[01:28:30.694 --> 01:28:34.376]  They're actually saying it will be a terrorist attack if Iran fights back.
[01:28:35.297 --> 01:28:37.939]  And they're talking about nuking them if they fight back.
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.700]  This is unbelievable.
[01:28:39.821 --> 01:28:41.902]  We're about to have World War III, boys and girls.
[01:28:41.922 --> 01:28:42.603]  Ray McGovern?
[01:28:43.684 --> 01:28:44.604]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.065 --> 01:28:46.566]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.658 --> 01:28:48.458]  We're good to go.
[01:29:09.705 --> 01:29:15.888]  The MPG cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[01:29:16.068 --> 01:29:20.770]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved, and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.
[01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:28.853]  People all across the nation are reporting improved performance as well as the money saving increases in their gas mileage by using our MPG caps.
[01:29:29.213 --> 01:29:30.034]  That's 800-526-1778.
[01:29:30.054 --> 01:29:32.096]  Or visit the webpage at mpgbiz.com.
[01:29:32.116 --> 01:29:32.656]  That's mpgbiz.com.
[01:29:53.763 --> 01:30:02.026]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.286 --> 01:30:06.647]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.928 --> 01:30:15.851]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:19.672]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.972 --> 01:30:24.996]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.296 --> 01:30:32.021]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.501 --> 01:30:33.042]  What about you?
[01:30:33.806 --> 01:30:39.148]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35 of $14 savings.

[01:30:53.738 --> 01:31:01.000]  United States Pharmacopeia USP sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:04.221]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[01:31:04.341 --> 01:31:07.702]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:17.024]  Grown by nature, products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals with co-factors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[01:31:17.464 --> 01:31:23.789]  Over 50 studies have been conducted on renatured nutrients and over 20 have been published in peer-reviewed journals proclaiming their superiority.
[01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:28.693]  As a result, grown by nature vitamins and supplements are now recognized as simply the best available.
[01:31:29.073 --> 01:31:30.635]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:31.055 --> 01:31:36.259]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your grown by nature products today.
[01:31:36.719 --> 01:31:40.522]  We are what we eat and since we are of nature, we should eat foods in their natural form.
[01:31:40.883 --> 01:31:43.845]  Only grown by nature offers a full line of renatured nutrients.
[01:31:44.185 --> 01:31:45.705]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:46.126 --> 01:31:51.947]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[01:31:54.448 --> 01:31:59.589]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.269 --> 01:32:02.650]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:07.851]  We could not be talking about a more important issue today.
[01:32:08.031 --> 01:32:09.191]  That's why we're here live.
[01:32:09.451 --> 01:32:12.752]  Again, I'm so honored that Ray McGovern is taking time off on a day off
[01:32:13.388 --> 01:32:18.531]  He teaches as a professor and all his other activism to join us.
[01:32:18.811 --> 01:32:20.012]  We're looking at World War III.
[01:32:20.052 --> 01:32:26.355]  He's going to be at our big 9-11 conference in Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:32:26.715 --> 01:32:27.876]  Here's the details.
[01:32:28.336 --> 01:32:36.661]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here and I'm excited to announce we're going to have a huge 9-11 conference in downtown Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th of June.
[01:32:36.821 --> 01:32:39.142]  We're expecting around 1,000 people in attendance.
[01:32:39.762 --> 01:32:48.686]  At this historic event, we will irrefutably document that 9-11 was an inside job, a self-inflicted wound, a false flag terror operation.
[01:32:49.166 --> 01:32:52.707]  The conference is titled 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda.
[01:32:53.168 --> 01:33:06.373]  I'm happy to announce the conference will feature presentations by incredible speakers like BYU physics professor Stephen Jones, the father of the Star Wars program, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bowman, former top-level CIA analyst for Reagan and Bush,
[01:33:06.773 --> 01:33:14.019]  Ray McGovern, 9-11 hero William Rodriguez, author Webster Turnbull, professor Jim Fetzer, and many, many others, including special guests.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:18.023]  I'll also be debuting my explosive new film, Terror Storm, at the conference.
[01:33:18.583 --> 01:33:19.784]  Arm yourself with the truth.
[01:33:20.204 --> 01:33:25.489]  Secure your tickets today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:29.509 --> 01:33:31.830]  I hope you will take action, folks.
[01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:34.910]  I hope that you will go to Infowars.com and get your tickets.
[01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:44.473]  I hope that you will call toll-free to get them 1-888-253-3139 or go to that same website or call that same toll-free number and get my film, Martial Law, get Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:44.793 --> 01:33:47.494]  Get them, make copies, get them out to everybody you can now.
[01:33:47.594 --> 01:33:49.314]  Going back to Ray McGovern.
[01:33:50.046 --> 01:33:55.609]  Mr. McGovern, go through this for us, because we know that they're saying they want to hit them.
[01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:57.190]  We know they're saying they need to hit them.
[01:33:57.210 --> 01:34:04.654]  We know that Cheney's saying they can have nukes within a month, when the CIA's own assessment last year is ten years.
[01:34:05.135 --> 01:34:07.156]  We have you talking about that in the new film Terror Storm.
[01:34:07.576 --> 01:34:09.157]  But earlier you said seven years.
[01:34:09.217 --> 01:34:12.018]  I guess there's some new assessment.
[01:34:12.759 --> 01:34:14.360]  And then we have all this propaganda.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.902]  We were talking about that before the break, claiming they were going to put...
[01:34:19.073 --> 01:34:21.214]  Special symbols on Jews and Christians.
[01:34:21.534 --> 01:34:22.874]  Again, total fabrication.
[01:34:23.895 --> 01:34:28.796]  And then my other question is, have we seen three carrier groups mass in the last year?
[01:34:28.816 --> 01:34:31.277]  I mean, is this the first time we've seen this configuration?
[01:34:31.577 --> 01:34:33.498]  What are you hearing from people inside the government?
[01:34:33.898 --> 01:34:40.020]  Break it down for us, and then what we'll see if this attack takes place, what some of the different scenarios are, sir.
[01:34:41.521 --> 01:34:45.762]  Well, there is one carrier task force already there in the Gulf.
[01:34:46.063 --> 01:34:47.363]  Two are steaming toward it.
[01:34:48.144 --> 01:34:53.890]  And that last report that I have at least, they will all be there in another week or so.
[01:34:53.910 --> 01:35:04.661]  The folly of this attack can be explained partly by the same folly that we experienced in Vietnam where
[01:35:05.495 --> 01:35:16.879]  Well, the folks with the blue suits and the stars on their lapels tell the president, oh, hey, you know, we can bomb the hell out of these folks, and, you know, we have these precision bombs, and we can just do the job.
[01:35:16.959 --> 01:35:18.580]  Don't have to worry about anything else.
[01:35:19.355 --> 01:35:37.990]  And so it seems to me that the first attempt will simply be bombing, using stealth bombers and others and cruise missiles and so forth in hopes that enough of the known facilities having to do with nuclear facilities there in Iran will be taken out.
[01:35:38.690 --> 01:35:42.513]  What these folks never think of is what happens the next day, you know?
[01:35:42.993 --> 01:35:44.354]  And that's, I think, what you're asking.
[01:35:44.374 --> 01:35:45.996]  Well, what happens the next day is this...
[01:35:48.364 --> 01:36:02.854]  Iran is in command, and I mean in command, of a terrorist network worldwide that makes al-Qaeda look like the Mount Sinai volleyball team.
[01:36:03.314 --> 01:36:08.417]  These guys really can do a lot of damage, and they can do it here in this country as well.
[01:36:08.877 --> 01:36:09.698]  That's number one.
[01:36:10.396 --> 01:36:17.560]  Number two, they have sophisticated weaponry that can skim across the waves of the Gulf and sink ships like U.S.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.721]  ships and other ships.
[01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:19.561]  Cruise missiles?
[01:36:19.981 --> 01:36:20.702]  Yeah.
[01:36:20.722 --> 01:36:25.344]  Well, actually, these are line-of-sight missiles.
[01:36:25.845 --> 01:36:28.426]  They're very, very fast, and they're very, very effective.
[01:36:28.446 --> 01:36:30.107]  Is that the Exocet or Silkworm?
[01:36:31.108 --> 01:36:31.668]  They're both.
[01:36:32.208 --> 01:36:36.851]  The Silkworm was the latest, but now I understand there's an even more advanced version of that.
[01:36:37.594 --> 01:36:43.017]  And then finally, of course, those of you who have a little grain here will relate to this.
[01:36:43.778 --> 01:36:50.982]  The Iranians can easily send three divisions of Revolutionary Guard troops right over the yellow, you know?
[01:36:51.582 --> 01:36:55.124]  By the yellow, I mean the long border with Iraq.
[01:36:55.384 --> 01:36:56.085]  And they'll fight.
[01:36:56.145 --> 01:37:00.907]  They had almost no real military hardware, and up against $30 billion of U.S.
[01:37:00.988 --> 01:37:02.188]  funding, beat Saddam.
[01:37:02.588 --> 01:37:02.989]  They did.
[01:37:03.249 --> 01:37:03.869]  Toe to toe.
[01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:06.411]  The problem is, you know, where are our guys?
[01:37:06.511 --> 01:37:06.751]  Well...
[01:37:07.279 --> 01:37:22.384]  Our guys are all over Tikrit and Baghdad and Ramadi, and they're looking for terrorists, of course, and so they're not in any position to contend with an invasion of Iraq, an invasion welcomed by the local Sunni population.
[01:37:22.944 --> 01:37:24.204]  And so what's going to happen then?
[01:37:24.304 --> 01:37:33.047]  Well, my worst fear is that when that goes up, or that comes down, as we say these days, there's going to be an irresistible urge
[01:37:33.846 --> 01:37:35.027]  To use what we do have.
[01:37:35.347 --> 01:37:38.410]  And, of course, what we do have are these mini-nukes.
[01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:45.676]  And this crowd makes no real distinction between high-explosive weaponry and these little mini-nukes.
[01:37:46.877 --> 01:37:48.898]  They're no big deal.
[01:37:48.998 --> 01:37:55.884]  And that will unleash a Pandora's box and we'll be in real deep key, not only in the immediate area, but
[01:37:56.345 --> 01:37:59.006]  With people like the Russians and people like the Chinese.
[01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:02.547]  Well, that's the point I wanted to bring up next, but let me just digress back with a few questions.
[01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:05.048]  Jack Straw, big neocon, pro-war.
[01:38:06.308 --> 01:38:09.289]  A few weeks ago, he says openly, this is crazy.
[01:38:09.769 --> 01:38:11.049]  The words he used were your words.
[01:38:11.449 --> 01:38:13.570]  This is crazy to attack Iran.
[01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:17.511]  It'll be total destabilization, World War III, boom.
[01:38:17.571 --> 01:38:19.432]  He's forced to resign a day later.
[01:38:19.812 --> 01:38:20.452]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:20.472 --> 01:38:23.093]  Well, that's what happens, you know, if you don't get with the program.
[01:38:24.955 --> 01:38:27.776]  You either get forced to resign or you do resign.
[01:38:27.796 --> 01:38:28.897]  This doesn't happen very much.
[01:38:28.937 --> 01:38:39.401]  But it's got to be bad when even their stalwarts like Strom, and we've had now eight generals, it's not six, there were two before them, eight generals come out and say that this is totally horrible.
[01:38:40.336 --> 01:38:43.180]  Mr. McGovern, we know that Rumsfeld isn't stupid.
[01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:44.823]  We know about P2OG.
[01:38:45.284 --> 01:38:49.249]  And clearly, you talked about when he's in trouble widening something's the plan.
[01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:51.453]  They know Iran's going to go totally ape.
[01:38:51.873 --> 01:38:54.637]  They know there's going to be attacks all over the Middle East and the Western world.
[01:38:54.657 --> 01:38:56.060]  They'll call them all terrorist attacks.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:06.186]  And then we're going to see Bush widen it, national draft, and then, oh, America's in trouble, our troops are being overrun, we've got to fully commit.
[01:39:06.266 --> 01:39:08.227]  I mean, isn't that really their plan?
[01:39:08.247 --> 01:39:17.433]  And then I think you will see Bush's approval ratings explode because Americans will get behind the leader, but it'll be a crisis he puts us in the way of by design.
[01:39:17.453 --> 01:39:19.994]  I mean, sir, you're a great analyst.
[01:39:20.034 --> 01:39:20.955]  I agree with your analysis.
[01:39:21.495 --> 01:39:26.619]  Don't you see there, or do you agree or do you disagree, or give us your take, on they're doing this on purpose.
[01:39:26.659 --> 01:39:27.840]  They know what's going to happen.
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:30.362]  Their analysts are telling them what's going to happen.
[01:39:30.402 --> 01:39:33.945]  They know what you just said is true, so they understand this.
[01:39:34.826 --> 01:39:38.028]  Well, there are two things here, Alex.
[01:39:38.989 --> 01:39:41.811]  Hubris, arrogance, and ignorance.
[01:39:42.491 --> 01:39:45.614]  None of these guys know the first thing about military affairs.
[01:39:46.414 --> 01:39:53.957]  The only person who really served was Rumsfeld, and I think he was between Korea and Vietnam, never saw any real combat.
[01:39:54.017 --> 01:39:56.098]  Never involved in strategy, he just flew planes.
[01:39:56.338 --> 01:40:01.860]  Yeah, you know, so he's like McNamara, he knows it all, because he went to Ivy League school, that kind of stuff.
[01:40:02.681 --> 01:40:10.104]  The other thing is the president's approval ratings, or disapproval ratings, more correctly said, which you alluded to earlier on.
[01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:15.306]  And that has an awful lot to do with this, and has a lot to do with my fear that this would come soon.
[01:40:16.013 --> 01:40:16.853]  Look at them.
[01:40:16.913 --> 01:40:18.714]  They're at 28%, 29%.
[01:40:20.234 --> 01:40:25.035]  I can see Karl Rove saying, look, what you need to do is become a war president again.
[01:40:25.495 --> 01:40:35.236]  Get us involved in something pretty big here and then strut around and say, you can't vote for a bunch of Democrats to pull the rug out from under me while there's a war going on in November.
[01:40:35.256 --> 01:40:36.257]  You know, that kind of thing.
[01:40:36.737 --> 01:40:41.458]  So I see that as one of the primary incentives for them to unleash this thing.
[01:40:41.598 --> 01:40:43.398]  And again, they have no real...
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.022]  They have no real expertise to draw on.
[01:40:46.042 --> 01:40:52.746]  I mean, we suggested and we pleaded with the President before the war in Iraq.
[01:40:53.407 --> 01:41:13.421]  On the same day as Colin Powell spoke, we finished our memo saying, Mr. President, we strongly urge you to broaden the circle of your advisors beyond those already bent on a war for which we see no cogent reason and from which we believe the unintended consequences are likely to be catastrophic.
[01:41:13.857 --> 01:41:25.024]  Now, you know, we take no delight in being right there, but we take great pain and great worry of seeing the circle narrowing even more.
[01:41:25.465 --> 01:41:30.648]  Not even Colin Powell, for whatever he was worth, he knew a couple things these others didn't.
[01:41:31.008 --> 01:41:32.329]  He's not even there again.
[01:41:32.809 --> 01:41:36.271]  And I just add this footnote here because it seems really relevant.
[01:41:37.752 --> 01:41:43.216]  The only time that, in my experience, I've been watching things for 43 years now in Washington...
[01:41:44.116 --> 01:42:11.663]  The only time we really came close to a nuclear exchange was during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and we avoided that primarily for one reason and one reason only, and that was that John Kennedy had the presence of mind to insist that Llewellyn Thompson, who had just retired from being ambassador to Moscow for a scanty eight years, okay, to insist that Llewellyn Thompson be there at every, every decision meeting, every consultation meeting.
[01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:25.556]  And so when Curtis LeMay, the head of the Air Force, had his nuclear weapons all loaded up in his bombers, and they were all set to take off, Llewellyn Thompson said, Sir, Mr. President, I do not agree.
[01:42:26.337 --> 01:42:28.658]  And everybody looked up, and he says, What did you say?
[01:42:29.358 --> 01:42:30.679]  Mr. President, I disagree.
[01:42:30.699 --> 01:42:37.422]  And then John Kennedy listened to him, and what Llewellyn Thompson said was this, Look, you have two messages from Herschel,
[01:42:38.095 --> 01:42:39.435]  You know the rest of the story.
[01:42:59.116 --> 01:43:00.417]  Why am I mentioning this?
[01:43:00.597 --> 01:43:04.578]  We got a conciliatory message from the Iranian president.
[01:43:04.938 --> 01:43:05.859]  Yeah, we do.
[01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:06.399]  Okay.
[01:43:06.419 --> 01:43:15.042]  You know, the parallel is really intriguing because the bottom line is, Alex, and this is really scary.
[01:43:15.102 --> 01:43:15.882]  The bottom line is they...
[01:43:18.138 --> 01:43:20.739]  The Iranian president lost a lot of face doing that.
[01:43:20.779 --> 01:43:24.180]  They'd never done that before, and Bush didn't even read it before they responded.
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:25.200]  Exactly.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.922]  And from our side, there just ain't no Llewellyn Thompson around now.
[01:43:30.022 --> 01:43:35.044]  And if there were, he'd not be permitted anywhere near the inner circle of the presidency.
[01:43:35.084 --> 01:43:37.184]  So we have Cheney and Rumsfeld.
[01:43:37.585 --> 01:43:42.786]  We have the cabal that is so well described by Colin Powell's chief of state, Larry Wilkerson.
[01:43:43.367 --> 01:43:47.088]  They're making all the decisions, and they're the ones responsible for Iraq.
[01:43:49.533 --> 01:43:53.035]  In a lighter vein, Alex, I have a solution.
[01:43:53.235 --> 01:43:56.037]  What we ought to do is have Congress pass a bill.
[01:43:56.853 --> 01:44:06.961]  Making it unlawful for President Bush to attack any country whose president has a name that Bush can't pronounce.
[01:44:08.162 --> 01:44:10.363]  That should give us a couple of weeks at least.
[01:44:10.723 --> 01:44:14.866]  Ahmed Ajad, I have trouble pronouncing it.
[01:44:15.287 --> 01:44:19.490]  I do too, but it would take our president for a while to do that.
[01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:22.753]  No, seriously, it's a very, very serious situation.
[01:44:22.873 --> 01:44:26.055]  Congress is willing to let Rumsfeld do what he wants.
[01:44:26.216 --> 01:44:27.437]  I mean, he's got U.S.
[01:44:27.497 --> 01:44:31.720]  Marines inside Iran now without any allusion to Congress.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:36.904]  Well, this is like Hitler turning east and going up against Russia when he had problems.
[01:44:36.944 --> 01:44:42.149]  We've now gotten the documents of Goebbels and Goering and, of course, Himmler's debates.
[01:44:42.589 --> 01:44:43.530]  We're good to go.
[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:44.030]  We're good to go.
[01:45:10.734 --> 01:45:15.576]  You know, you've said that the mosque bombing, some of the things we've seen have Western intelligence written all over it.
[01:45:15.996 --> 01:45:35.424]  What about our own governments or someone in the government or a private group staging some event and then claiming Iran has carried it out as a prelude to attacking Iran or even once Iran is attacked, intelligence agencies launching something in Europe or the U.S.
[01:45:35.745 --> 01:45:37.345]  and then claiming Iran did that.
[01:45:37.365 --> 01:45:38.066]  Your take on that?
[01:45:40.222 --> 01:45:42.104]  Well, Alex, that's altogether possible.
[01:45:42.805 --> 01:45:54.197]  That's altogether possible, and I would say even probable, because they would need some proximate cause, some casus belli to justify really unleashing things on Iran.
[01:45:54.778 --> 01:45:59.043]  And that would help, of course, and I would put very little past this crew.
[01:45:59.883 --> 01:46:00.144]  They're...
[01:46:01.806 --> 01:46:07.108]  The record of dissembling and disingenuousness is unparalleled.
[01:46:07.428 --> 01:46:10.069]  Well, look at the, which I'm glad you brought up on national TV.
[01:46:10.089 --> 01:46:11.410]  I brought it up on CNN as well.
[01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:16.252]  We're the only two that have done it and gotten through the Berlin Wall of Media Control, the Iron Curtain.
[01:46:16.792 --> 01:46:20.474]  But the White House memo is much more important than Downing Street.
[01:46:20.734 --> 01:46:23.555]  I mean, we have them talking about painting up a plane like a U.N.
[01:46:23.575 --> 01:46:28.517]  plane and trying to get it shot down or saying a defector found WMDs.
[01:46:28.577 --> 01:46:30.758]  I mean, these guys, that is the smoking gun.
[01:46:31.378 --> 01:46:31.839]  That's right.
[01:46:32.239 --> 01:46:41.308]  And, you know, the whole thing was that they knew that they weren't weapons of mass destruction, so they're going to have to do something else or something to hasten the process of doing the war.
[01:46:41.649 --> 01:46:45.753]  Let me say another word, Alex, about the electoral business here.
[01:46:45.773 --> 01:46:54.262]  The stakes could not be larger for this administration, because if the Democrats take the House in November...
[01:46:55.331 --> 01:46:59.112]  There will be, in my view, impeachment proceedings for sure.
[01:46:59.252 --> 01:47:01.613]  I've had two congressmen on this show say that as well.
[01:47:01.833 --> 01:47:05.894]  It's 100% impeachment, then the whole crime cabal will get blown.
[01:47:06.134 --> 01:47:06.854]  That's exactly right.
[01:47:06.874 --> 01:47:09.135]  There will be investigations for the next two years.
[01:47:09.255 --> 01:47:11.336]  Now, those could be consequential.
[01:47:12.096 --> 01:47:18.398]  People can get impeached, but also people can get thrown into jail, as we saw last week with the Enron types.
[01:47:18.478 --> 01:47:19.618]  Ken Lay, six counts.
[01:47:19.818 --> 01:47:22.679]  Yeah, so there's a lot riding on this thing.
[01:47:22.859 --> 01:47:23.219]  And so...
[01:47:24.384 --> 01:47:32.537]  It behooves the President, or I'm sure Cheney, Gonzalez, Rove, and the rest of them are saying, Mr. President, we've got to prevent this at any cost.
[01:47:32.998 --> 01:47:35.722]  If it means using our smart weaponry to
[01:47:36.758 --> 01:47:38.859]  To do the job on Iran?
[01:47:38.899 --> 01:47:40.199]  Well, let's just go ahead and do it.
[01:47:40.359 --> 01:47:45.441]  And if we consult people like Ken Edelman, I'm sure he'll tell us there'll be a cakewalk again.
[01:47:45.581 --> 01:47:46.461]  What about Israel?
[01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:53.924]  I mean, we noticed it was the ADL out of Canada that first put out the fake report of Jews having to wear basically yellow stars.
[01:47:53.984 --> 01:47:55.645]  Again, total lie now, folks.
[01:47:55.965 --> 01:47:57.605]  Totally retracted, but quietly.
[01:47:58.225 --> 01:48:00.506]  Why is Israel jumping up and down?
[01:48:00.666 --> 01:48:03.107]  Why do they want an attack on Iran?
[01:48:03.147 --> 01:48:05.308]  I mean, they're not really threatened by Iran right now.
[01:48:05.388 --> 01:48:05.588]  Why?
[01:48:06.377 --> 01:48:08.138]  Well, there are two things here.
[01:48:08.198 --> 01:48:10.820]  First, we need to be a little careful when we talk about Israel.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.204]  This is a clique of right-wing Likud types.
[01:48:15.224 --> 01:48:15.784]  No, I understand.
[01:48:15.824 --> 01:48:17.145]  I'm talking about the leadership, though.
[01:48:17.385 --> 01:48:19.447]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:19.547 --> 01:48:24.230]  And they are kind of way out in front.
[01:48:24.451 --> 01:48:30.075]  And what I would emphasize is that they are incredibly short-sighted.
[01:48:30.735 --> 01:48:31.976]  Look what happened in Iraq.
[01:48:32.657 --> 01:48:35.599]  If part of the objective, which I'm convinced it was,
[01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:38.550]  Was to make Israel more secure.
[01:48:39.250 --> 01:48:42.691]  Well, you know, there weren't any terrorists in Iraq before we invaded there.
[01:48:42.751 --> 01:48:47.753]  Now it's teeming with terrorists, a lot of them out to do Israel in, okay?
[01:48:48.213 --> 01:48:49.074]  So that's one thing.
[01:48:49.974 --> 01:49:03.139]  The other thing is that, you know, from a general perspective, the Israelis do not want to take any chances that any country, especially Iran, would erode its nuclear monopoly in the Middle East.
[01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:06.351]  They have 300 to 400 nuclear weapons there.
[01:49:06.371 --> 01:49:07.932]  Nobody mentions that.
[01:49:08.352 --> 01:49:18.240]  But they want to keep that monopoly, and they see it as a big infringement on their security, where Iran could get even just one or two weapons.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:24.384]  Now, Ahmadinejad makes it easy for the Israelis to raise the flag.
[01:49:24.424 --> 01:49:27.606]  If they look, they're going to zomp us as soon as they get a weapon.
[01:49:27.987 --> 01:49:30.889]  I don't think it will happen, because that would be suicide for Iran.
[01:49:32.512 --> 01:49:33.553]  Ahmed Dinejad.
[01:49:33.713 --> 01:49:41.858]  I want to talk about if you were Ahmed Dinejad or Dinejad, what would Ray McGovern do if you were Ahmed Dinejad?
[01:49:42.238 --> 01:49:44.620]  What would you do right now to try to avert this?
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:49.843]  And in closing, what do you think Iran and China are going to do when and if this attack takes place?
[01:49:55.043 --> 01:49:57.884]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.145 --> 01:49:58.845]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.945 --> 01:49:59.725]  Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.065 --> 01:50:04.728]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.068 --> 01:50:11.811]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.151 --> 01:50:14.111]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.332 --> 01:50:17.172]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.272 --> 01:50:21.913]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.133 --> 01:50:26.534]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.774 --> 01:50:33.996]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.236 --> 01:50:36.657]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:51:07.337 --> 01:51:12.019]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.479 --> 01:51:19.203]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.603 --> 01:51:31.370]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:36.334]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:52:49.597 --> 01:52:57.763]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live, Genesis Communications.
[01:52:57.823 --> 01:53:01.625]  I'm going to ask Ray McGovern to grace us with another five minutes into the next hour.
[01:53:01.645 --> 01:53:06.049]  Then I'm going to run a rebroadcast of a pastor we had on last week, and we have the documents.
[01:53:06.609 --> 01:53:08.450]  They're openly recruited pastors in 13,000 counties.
[01:53:10.811 --> 01:53:11.551]  We're good to go.
[01:53:11.571 --> 01:53:11.992]  We're good to go.
[01:53:12.012 --> 01:53:12.492]  We're good to go.
[01:53:29.995 --> 01:53:32.837]  That domestically they can take over as well.
[01:53:33.298 --> 01:53:40.923]  Ray McGovern, can you comment on all of the preparations we've seen for domestic Stasi-type operations, sir?
[01:53:42.224 --> 01:53:43.345]  Not in five minutes, Alex.
[01:53:44.006 --> 01:53:45.227]  Well, I mean, just briefly?
[01:53:45.487 --> 01:53:46.107]  No, I'm sorry.
[01:53:46.147 --> 01:53:47.428]  The list is very long.
[01:53:48.389 --> 01:53:54.094]  I'll tell you one that hit really close to home, and one that people don't know about.
[01:53:54.634 --> 01:53:59.358]  In the Intelligence Authorization Bill that Pete Hoekstra, the president,
[01:54:00.228 --> 01:54:01.849]  The head of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:54:02.409 --> 01:54:05.491]  He put in a provision which says this.
[01:54:06.252 --> 01:54:27.365]  The Director of National Intelligence shall prepare a study in 90 days to determine whether he, under existing authorities, can suspend the pensions of CIA pensioners for talking about classified material.
[01:54:28.198 --> 01:54:30.559]  Or whether he needs additional authorities.
[01:54:31.239 --> 01:54:34.539]  Now, that's creeping fascism right there.
[01:54:34.599 --> 01:54:37.640]  In other words, they determine what's classified information.
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:42.361]  If that gets passed, I'm not going to be able to talk on your radio program anymore.
[01:54:42.781 --> 01:54:46.902]  I'll be liable to be wrapped up here in some sort of dragnet.
[01:54:47.462 --> 01:54:49.163]  So that's the kind of thing that's happening.
[01:54:49.383 --> 01:54:50.343]  On the NSA thing...
[01:54:51.236 --> 01:55:04.580]  If you probably know, Congressman Hinchey from New York asked the Justice Department to look into what advice the Justice Department had given NSA to say that that thing was legal, and guess what happened?
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:16.404]  After two months, the Justice Department responded to Congressman Hinchey saying, sorry, we have to drop the investigation because NSA will not give us the clearances we need to investigate NSA.
[01:55:17.116 --> 01:55:19.296]  That's happened now with the FCC as well.
[01:55:19.557 --> 01:55:26.438]  And that's dictatorship when they say, oh, the military or this government arm is telling us in enforcement what we can do.
[01:55:26.498 --> 01:55:29.839]  What do you see happening with Iran and Syria?
[01:55:30.499 --> 01:55:33.660]  If Iran is attacked, what do you think Russia and China will do?
[01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:38.381]  We know Russia just sold a bunch of high-tech anti-aircraft systems to Iran.
[01:55:39.441 --> 01:55:44.842]  Well, I think that if I were Ahmadinejad, I would be asking the Chinese and the Russians for some sort of...
[01:55:45.522 --> 01:55:46.603]  Military support.
[01:55:47.284 --> 01:55:52.929]  Some sort of pledge that they won't stand idly by to watch this kind of exercise.
[01:55:54.951 --> 01:55:57.953]  What Ahmadinejad has already done was quite unprecedented.
[01:55:57.973 --> 01:56:02.598]  The first time in 27 years that they communicated with us that long letter.
[01:56:03.058 --> 01:56:06.221]  I advise everyone to download that letter and read it.
[01:56:06.261 --> 01:56:10.585]  It's really quite ironic, citing Bush's professed Christianity
[01:56:11.056 --> 01:56:15.398]  And asking him to square that with the behavior that he's exhibited.
[01:56:15.658 --> 01:56:16.499]  What else would you do?
[01:56:16.879 --> 01:56:21.341]  I'd try to capture some of those folks that are in his country now.
[01:56:21.361 --> 01:56:32.066]  They've already captured some of the dissidents, and there are lots of them, that are being run by our covert operatives, not CIA types, but defense types.
[01:56:32.846 --> 01:56:35.528]  And I'd warn the Azerbaijanis.
[01:56:36.608 --> 01:56:37.929]  The Azerbaijanis...
[01:56:39.443 --> 01:56:50.289]  That ethnic group comprises about 20-25% of the Iranian nation, and they are being egged on by all manner of folks supported by us.
[01:56:51.079 --> 01:56:51.960]  We're good to go.
[01:57:14.105 --> 01:57:15.405]  Ray McGovern, a one-minute break.
[01:57:15.425 --> 01:57:17.666]  When we get back, we'll spend five final minutes with you.
[01:57:17.686 --> 01:57:19.827]  We really appreciate the time on this Memorial Day.
[01:57:20.327 --> 01:57:21.908]  This is such an important issue.
[01:57:22.328 --> 01:57:26.469]  World War III is upon us, or as the neocons call it, World War IV.
[01:57:26.909 --> 01:57:29.950]  They believe the Cold War was World War III, but this is a hot war.
[01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.931]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.352 --> 01:57:38.013]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.654 --> 01:57:50.294]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.955 --> 01:57:52.015]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.736 --> 01:57:53.816]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.497 --> 01:57:55.297]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.057 --> 01:57:56.958]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.978 --> 01:58:01.300]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.922]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.503 --> 01:58:09.384]  All right, now into the third hour, final segment with Ray McGovern.
[01:58:09.404 --> 01:58:10.485]  Sorry we're not taking your calls.
[01:58:10.505 --> 01:58:11.805]  This information is so important.
[01:58:11.825 --> 01:58:12.866]  We need all the time we've got.
[01:58:14.289 --> 01:58:19.957]  World War III, Ray McGovern is predicting that there's a good chance that there will be an attack on Iran.
[01:58:19.977 --> 01:58:28.147]  I want him to recap and add any addendums to that, more information, and just any other key points you'd like to make in the four minutes we've got left.
[01:58:28.187 --> 01:58:31.412]  I just want to mention that he will be one of our keynote speakers.
[01:58:32.132 --> 01:58:33.032]  We're good to go.
[01:58:48.132 --> 01:58:52.175]  Well, I'm a little ahead of my colleagues and veteran intelligence professionals for sanity.
[01:58:52.195 --> 01:58:54.836]  We all pretty much agree that an attack is likely before the election.
[01:59:18.724 --> 01:59:22.126]  And we all agree that it has to do largely with the election.
[01:59:23.267 --> 01:59:29.310]  As for timing, I see a likelihood that it could come as early as late June or early July.
[01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:36.014]  Most of my colleagues predicted August, September, maybe an October surprise even.
[01:59:37.155 --> 01:59:46.620]  My thinking is that for it to be October, that would be so crass and so transparent that even this crowd would shy away from making it so obvious.
[01:59:47.375 --> 01:59:52.798]  But the propaganda has been, the basis has been laid.
[01:59:52.958 --> 01:59:55.199]  The aircraft carriers are in place.
[01:59:55.219 --> 01:59:58.661]  It doesn't take much to fly the bombers out of British and U.S.
[01:59:58.741 --> 01:59:59.221]  bases.
[02:00:00.302 --> 02:00:01.642]  Cruise missiles are at the ready.
[02:00:02.463 --> 02:00:04.104]  Israel is egging us on.
[02:00:04.564 --> 02:00:08.566]  The President himself talks about our alliance with Israel.
[02:00:09.230 --> 02:00:13.418]  And so I suspect that they will go unless deterred.
[02:00:13.478 --> 02:00:14.840]  Now, how could we deter them?
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:20.571]  Well, I think if we have armed forces in Iran, which I am reliably informed we do,
[02:00:21.297 --> 02:00:29.043]  Well, we need to go to our senators and representatives and say, under whose authority has Rumsfeld put these folks in Iran?
[02:00:29.484 --> 02:00:35.148]  And we should sit in their offices until they see us and answer our question because this is beyond the pale.
[02:00:35.168 --> 02:00:45.296]  And if we don't start putting our bodies into it instead of writing op-eds or making speeches like I do, if we don't put our bodies into it, well, you know, Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:00:45.316 --> 02:00:48.779]  said one time, there is such a thing as too late.
[02:00:49.995 --> 02:00:54.337]  Well, I mean, in all fairness to you, you went and physically protested to Rumsfeld.
[02:00:54.357 --> 02:00:57.099]  You've gone to his house a few weeks ago and protested at his home.
[02:00:57.119 --> 02:01:09.085]  Yeah, I'm getting a little better at that, but I'm trying to convince people that we need to do more than the usual, that these are perilous times, and that we have to discern what the best thing to do is, hopefully.
[02:01:09.565 --> 02:01:13.407]  So you think we have a chance to stop them?
[02:01:13.467 --> 02:01:14.308]  I do.
[02:01:14.548 --> 02:01:24.374]  Yeah, I do think that because there's so much coming down now and so many egregious things that we don't really have any choice whether we think it's likely or not.
[02:01:24.594 --> 02:01:29.377]  So a few more whistleblowers could save this country bringing out more dirt right now?
[02:01:29.537 --> 02:01:34.120]  Well, that we're hoping and we have had, as you know, some success in that.
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:38.443]  That's why they're applying light detector tests to everybody they can find.
[02:01:39.164 --> 02:01:40.385]  So, yeah, there is hope.
[02:01:40.705 --> 02:01:51.333]  And, you know, even if people judge the likelihood to be less than even that this next war can be prevented, well, you know, we're not supposed to be about success.
[02:01:51.393 --> 02:01:56.057]  We're supposed to be about being faithful to the people who created this great country.
[02:01:56.077 --> 02:01:56.457]  You're right.
[02:01:56.497 --> 02:01:57.158]  We owe it to them.
[02:01:57.518 --> 02:01:57.858]  You're right.
[02:01:57.898 --> 02:02:01.901]  In fact, the famous statement of George Washington, his duty is ours, consequence belongs to God.
[02:02:02.262 --> 02:02:08.887]  The final comment, having all these generals going public, does that show the majority of the brass is against this war?
[02:02:09.875 --> 02:02:10.676]  Yes and no.
[02:02:11.016 --> 02:02:12.557]  The retired brass, yes.
[02:02:13.237 --> 02:02:19.241]  The current brass, they're all creatures of this regime, and they'll salute and do what they're told.
[02:02:19.802 --> 02:02:26.706]  So it's not quite legitimate or wise to place any faith in the notion that they will disobey orders.
[02:02:27.077 --> 02:02:28.719]  Ray McGovern, have a great Memorial Day.
[02:02:28.739 --> 02:02:32.925]  I can't think of a better way of you to serve the country as you've done for so long for joining us today.
[02:02:32.985 --> 02:02:33.826]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:02:33.846 --> 02:02:36.069]  I can't wait to see you in person in Los Angeles.
[02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.710]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:37.611]  I'm looking forward to it.
[02:02:38.292 --> 02:02:38.672]  I am too.
[02:02:38.712 --> 02:02:39.113]  God bless.
[02:02:39.533 --> 02:02:41.656]  We'll be right back with the FEMA news.
[02:02:45.501 --> 02:02:52.323]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.643 --> 02:02:54.023]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.203 --> 02:02:56.424]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.564 --> 02:02:58.664]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.945 --> 02:03:03.866]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.206 --> 02:03:08.247]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.487 --> 02:03:10.268]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.348 --> 02:03:20.996]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.136 --> 02:03:23.037]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.257 --> 02:03:27.120]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the Infowar.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:28.641]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[02:03:35.726 --> 02:03:36.948]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:53.814]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.
[02:03:54.014 --> 02:04:05.280]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:08.162]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.502 --> 02:04:14.964]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:15.124 --> 02:04:16.985]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:17.185 --> 02:04:23.207]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.447 --> 02:04:29.109]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:29.449 --> 02:04:33.375]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:34.136 --> 02:04:34.817]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.056 --> 02:04:47.637]  We're good to go.
[02:05:02.556 --> 02:05:07.599]  The MPG cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[02:05:07.739 --> 02:05:12.462]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved, and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.
[02:05:12.642 --> 02:05:20.546]  People all across the nation are reporting improved performance as well as the money saving increases in their gas mileage by using our MPG caps.
[02:05:20.886 --> 02:05:25.029]  MPG caps are designed for use in all gasoline or diesel-powered engines.
[02:05:25.409 --> 02:05:31.434]  And you can also have a lucrative home-based business by simply sharing this amazing money-saving product with others.
[02:05:31.594 --> 02:05:32.114]  Don't wait.

[02:05:45.695 --> 02:05:50.719]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:51.099 --> 02:05:53.401]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.421 --> 02:06:05.511]  I'm trying to find the famous Alexander Shultz and Nietzsche quote about, oh, how he burned in the camps.
[02:06:07.859 --> 02:06:08.599]  Probably find it.
[02:06:08.659 --> 02:06:13.421]  We've been looking on Google, having some trouble, but I know it's posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:06:13.441 --> 02:06:15.881]  We posted it years ago, but it's in some archive.
[02:06:16.201 --> 02:06:17.362]  Here's the social needs of quotes.
[02:06:17.882 --> 02:06:21.083]  A state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny.
[02:06:21.843 --> 02:06:25.124]  If one is forever cautious, can one remain a human being?
[02:06:25.784 --> 02:06:30.605]  Man has set for himself the goal of conquering the world, but in the process loses his soul.
[02:06:31.385 --> 02:06:37.067]  The name of reform simply covers what is latently a process of theft of the national heritage.
[02:06:37.742 --> 02:06:38.343]  We're good to go.
[02:06:58.676 --> 02:06:59.117]  We're good to go.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:24.282]  Where he lives, we have the documents.
[02:07:24.682 --> 02:07:26.284]  Pastor Butch Paw has gotten them from him.
[02:07:26.324 --> 02:07:27.685]  Pastor's put articles out on this.
[02:07:27.705 --> 02:07:31.029]  We ought to go get Pastor Butch Paw's article about this and post it.
[02:07:31.049 --> 02:07:32.490]  We're going to write our own article about it.
[02:07:34.011 --> 02:07:46.304]  I know for a fact that FEMA, going back with the Secure Corps program, a division of AmeriCorps, it was in the Philadelphia News, it was in Daily News, it was in several other publications.
[02:07:47.069 --> 02:08:03.344]  It's training high school students and middle school students with M16s, we're talking semi-autos, AR-15 variant, in warrant service, fighting terrorists, reporting on their parents, BATF, and hundreds of school districts we know of.
[02:08:03.385 --> 02:08:06.928]  We first learned of this six years ago in North Carolina.
[02:08:08.232 --> 02:08:09.212]  But it's nationwide.
[02:08:09.352 --> 02:08:21.176]  Have deputies paid by FEMA grant, but it goes through BATF, to have whole semesters in 7th and 8th grade where they have access to the students on the playground and at lunch.
[02:08:21.236 --> 02:08:24.697]  They have them write dossiers on their parents, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[02:08:24.857 --> 02:08:25.797]  You understand, folks?
[02:08:27.678 --> 02:08:28.278]  We have had...
[02:08:29.616 --> 02:08:36.069]  The head officer, the commander on from the Alabama Defense Forces, they cordon off parts of cities randomly and search women and children.
[02:08:36.349 --> 02:08:39.014]  We have photos and video of this in Martial Law, my new film.
[02:08:39.855 --> 02:08:42.837]  They search everyone, including three-year-old children, training them to be slaves.
[02:08:43.137 --> 02:08:44.118]  But the border is wide open.
[02:08:44.138 --> 02:08:45.659]  There are sporting events searching people.
[02:08:46.059 --> 02:08:49.502]  The Texas Defense Forces, known as the Texas Guard, are now being trained for this.
[02:08:49.542 --> 02:08:51.683]  We've got Texas Guard on this show.
[02:08:51.763 --> 02:08:52.904]  We have their own documents.
[02:08:53.244 --> 02:08:56.506]  They're shifting away from firefighting and things like that to gun confiscation.
[02:08:56.826 --> 02:08:58.588]  We reported all of this before New Orleans.
[02:08:58.888 --> 02:09:04.011]  In New Orleans, they sabotaged things, cut police lines, wouldn't let the police and firemen in to save people.
[02:09:04.451 --> 02:09:07.033]  Tens of thousands of police and firemen that came in from around the country.
[02:09:07.093 --> 02:09:09.635]  FEMA jammed their communications as the storm hit.
[02:09:10.095 --> 02:09:14.056]  Then after five days, they went in and confiscated guns, even in high and dry wealthy areas.
[02:09:14.316 --> 02:09:15.517]  We played the video of that.
[02:09:15.557 --> 02:09:16.417]  You've seen it online.
[02:09:16.437 --> 02:09:18.318]  You've seen it on national television.
[02:09:19.098 --> 02:09:26.080]  To the point of the NRA is trying to get national laws passed, just saying, please don't confiscate our guns during emergencies.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:29.421]  There are congressmen saying confiscating guns during emergencies are good.
[02:09:29.761 --> 02:09:35.423]  There's a state rep in Oklahoma saying gun confiscation is good and needs to happen during emergencies.
[02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:42.192]  I had a head professor on from the Homeland Security Department of a major university in Tennessee.
[02:09:43.312 --> 02:09:45.393]  They're in Knoxville just a few months ago, remember?
[02:09:45.973 --> 02:09:52.436]  And he admitted that he's the head volunteer of this program recruiting people to fight terror and crime, to report on their neighbors.
[02:09:53.056 --> 02:09:54.337]  All of this is going on.
[02:09:54.897 --> 02:09:59.198]  Now, under FEMA, we know they have a program to, quote, reach out to the churches.
[02:09:59.219 --> 02:10:02.900]  And you see the billboards about, quote, get ready.
[02:10:04.824 --> 02:10:05.505]  We're good to go.
[02:10:05.525 --> 02:10:05.665]  I think?
[02:10:35.045 --> 02:10:35.806]  Everything in it.
[02:10:35.866 --> 02:10:44.150]  It says property rights activists, manuals in Michigan say all homeschoolers are terrorists, federal manuals like Project Megiddo say it.
[02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:45.751]  It's all there.
[02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:47.892]  I appreciate the pastor holding while I set this up.
[02:10:48.524 --> 02:10:48.964]  We're good to go.
[02:10:48.984 --> 02:10:49.245]  I think?
[02:11:10.337 --> 02:11:12.598]  Because people know the preachers are trusted.
[02:11:13.099 --> 02:11:16.680]  And they're setting the preachers up as Judas Iscariot, Judas goats.
[02:11:17.181 --> 02:11:21.603]  A Judas goat, for those that raise goats or sheep, is the ram.
[02:11:21.763 --> 02:11:26.225]  And he's a ram that is trusted by the other goats or sheep, depending on what species.
[02:11:26.265 --> 02:11:28.566]  But you've got rams in both varieties.
[02:11:28.586 --> 02:11:30.447]  You've got the billy goats in both varieties.
[02:11:31.067 --> 02:11:37.631]  And they're trained to lead occasionally for the slaughter or the sale, because people do also slaughter these for meat, lamb chops or goat.
[02:11:39.916 --> 02:11:41.237]  Again, these two different species.
[02:11:41.898 --> 02:11:43.579]  But they have them, again, both in goats and sheep.
[02:11:43.599 --> 02:11:44.680]  And I'm getting too technical on that.
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:46.962]  The point is, it leads them in to be sheared.
[02:11:46.982 --> 02:11:48.022]  It leads them in to be killed.
[02:11:48.062 --> 02:11:49.303]  It leads them in to be sold.
[02:11:49.904 --> 02:11:51.185]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[02:11:51.245 --> 02:11:52.326]  It is so devilish.
[02:11:53.895 --> 02:11:59.418]  Pastor, thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[02:11:59.759 --> 02:12:01.259]  It's a definite pleasure to do this.
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:03.921]  I appreciate you letting me give folks the background on this.
[02:12:03.961 --> 02:12:09.524]  Tell us as much about yourself, what you first heard from them, the documents, the oath, what you've been witnessing.
[02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:12.651]  I'll try not to make it lengthy, but you know how that is.
[02:12:12.671 --> 02:12:15.711]  No, sir, we've got the whole hour if you've got the time.
[02:12:15.731 --> 02:12:16.291]  Take your time.
[02:12:16.432 --> 02:12:17.212]  Brother, I've got the time.
[02:12:17.232 --> 02:12:17.972]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:12:18.312 --> 02:12:23.553]  In March of this year, I was invited to attend a meeting, a local meeting of the Emergency Management Agency.
[02:12:24.614 --> 02:12:25.894]  We call it the local FEMA people.
[02:12:25.914 --> 02:12:33.496]  I was invited to come because I had done disaster relief work with another church denominational group years ago, and I wanted to see what was going on.
[02:12:33.516 --> 02:12:34.416]  They were planning for...
[02:12:35.129 --> 02:12:39.270]  Any kind of bioterrorism, they said, so I wanted to find out what it was, it being FEMA.
[02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:41.710]  And since we know the director, it got me in real good.
[02:12:41.730 --> 02:12:46.191]  Again, I want to add, on the surface it all sounds reasonable, oh, just emergency planning.
[02:12:46.492 --> 02:12:48.012]  That's on the billboards and the literature.
[02:12:48.072 --> 02:12:49.832]  You go to these meetings, tell us what happened.
[02:12:50.292 --> 02:13:02.295]  That was wonderful stuff when they started out, but it immediately turned into, this is for a natural disaster, a tornado flood, or any act of bioterrorism, or a nationally declared emergency.
[02:13:03.004 --> 02:13:11.394]  And so I lit up to that one, and the spokesperson there was from the state FEMA office, who also was the trainer for pastors in their training program for pastors.
[02:13:12.435 --> 02:13:18.221]  He said, your job, pastors, is to get to your congregations and preach to them Romans 13.
[02:13:19.782 --> 02:13:22.385]  And that's the part that says you obey the higher powers.
[02:13:22.626 --> 02:13:25.549]  And he was saying you have to teach them to obey their government.
[02:13:25.689 --> 02:13:27.451]  By the way, Hitler did that.
[02:13:27.531 --> 02:13:32.077]  He had a corps of preachers that preached Romans 13 out of context.
[02:13:32.217 --> 02:13:32.998]  Yes, he did.
[02:13:33.078 --> 02:13:34.780]  And this is what he wanted us to do.
[02:13:35.701 --> 02:13:37.363]  And so he's telling us that.
[02:13:37.463 --> 02:13:49.757]  He's telling us, and the thing that really got us started on this when I started contacting people is when he said the problem with local enforcement of a federal or state mandate that is quarantine or relocation
[02:13:50.257 --> 02:13:56.302]  These are terms he used for a declaration of martial law based on whatever disaster it might be.
[02:13:56.322 --> 02:13:57.703]  He said martial law.
[02:13:57.723 --> 02:13:58.303]  Let's be clear.
[02:13:58.483 --> 02:13:59.024]  Yes, he did.
[02:13:59.144 --> 02:14:05.929]  And he said if it goes the distance, the problem is all along the way is this so-called cowboy mentality.
[02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:09.752]  And you pastors are going to have to learn to quell that cowboy mentality.
[02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:10.962]  We're good to go.
[02:14:29.173 --> 02:14:30.714]  And you'll be preaching this ahead of time.
[02:14:30.854 --> 02:14:34.195]  You can stand in the neighborhoods and tell people this is for their own good.
[02:14:34.215 --> 02:14:35.656]  Got to stop you.
[02:14:36.276 --> 02:14:38.838]  You would have been preaching this ahead of time.
[02:14:38.898 --> 02:14:41.359]  Folks, this means they're going with it.
[02:14:41.919 --> 02:14:43.019]  And this is happening nationwide.
[02:14:43.059 --> 02:14:46.641]  We know there's this FEMA preacher leadership program going on.
[02:14:46.681 --> 02:14:51.663]  We know we've talked to other preachers now since Butch Paul broke this a few months ago with you, Pastor.
[02:14:52.164 --> 02:14:53.724]  This is real, folks.
[02:14:53.784 --> 02:14:55.025]  This is so evil.
[02:14:55.065 --> 02:14:55.745]  Please continue.
[02:14:55.785 --> 02:14:57.106]  This is deadly real.
[02:14:57.746 --> 02:14:58.886]  And that was our first meeting.
[02:14:58.926 --> 02:15:04.828]  The second meeting pretty much carried it through with our responsibility as pastors is to have training.
[02:15:05.488 --> 02:15:12.249]  And this man, who is a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, he's also on a national organization for disaster relief.
[02:15:12.289 --> 02:15:14.310]  He's also working with DHS and FEMA.
[02:15:15.330 --> 02:15:16.550]  He's on their payroll.
[02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:17.871]  We just found this out last week.
[02:15:18.031 --> 02:15:24.172]  He said that your pastor's jobs are going to be to deal with the individuals, not just in counseling.
[02:15:24.861 --> 02:15:28.463]  But you're going to have to control some folks who may not be so cooperative.
[02:15:28.683 --> 02:15:30.583]  He said, but that's going to be a law enforcement issue.
[02:15:30.643 --> 02:15:31.664]  You'll be backed by that.
[02:15:32.184 --> 02:15:35.686]  He said, besides, pastors aren't trained to handle everything.
[02:15:36.026 --> 02:15:39.367]  Imagine preachers leading SWAT teams.
[02:15:40.828 --> 02:15:43.929]  I mean, we're talking... Go ahead.
[02:15:43.949 --> 02:15:44.729]  That's terrible, isn't it?
[02:15:44.909 --> 02:15:46.270]  But that's the picture we get.
[02:15:46.610 --> 02:15:51.052]  We get the picture that we, me and others who are aware of this,
[02:15:51.397 --> 02:15:56.514]  We're going to be standing at some farmer's end of his lane while he's standing there with his double barrel wherever he's got.
[02:15:56.929 --> 02:15:58.330]  Telling him to lay the arms down.
[02:15:58.670 --> 02:16:00.971]  They have to confiscate your cows, your chickens.
[02:16:01.011 --> 02:16:02.832]  And he's got to be relocated to a camp.
[02:16:02.892 --> 02:16:10.455]  Now, for those that don't know, right here in Austin, we've confirmed some of the biggest churches are now FEMA officers secretly.
[02:16:10.475 --> 02:16:21.481]  Now, imagine how Soviet this is, how Red Dawn this is, where you go to church and little do you know, this guy is an actual servant of the Antichrist beast system.
[02:16:21.641 --> 02:16:21.961]  Mm-hmm.
[02:16:22.632 --> 02:16:23.252]  Exactly right.
[02:16:23.292 --> 02:16:24.493]  And this is what's so frightening.
[02:16:24.553 --> 02:16:30.595]  It started out, he made it sound like it was a local thing that we were doing and we're the pioneers, we're the first one.
[02:16:30.755 --> 02:16:31.695]  They always say that.
[02:16:31.735 --> 02:16:32.695]  They always say that.
[02:16:32.755 --> 02:16:34.036]  And I knew it was coming.
[02:16:34.136 --> 02:16:37.837]  Just last week there was training for pastors, which we'll get into at some point.
[02:16:37.957 --> 02:16:40.298]  I haven't faxed you the training manual.
[02:16:40.318 --> 02:16:41.398]  The training manual pretty much...
[02:16:41.898 --> 02:16:46.080]  Keeps pastors down by telling us we cannot handle all these mental health issues.
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:47.440]  Now, I know Butch has some of that.
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:53.483]  If you were during a break, Pastor, can you fax that to me during a break?
[02:16:53.503 --> 02:16:54.103]  I'll give you the number.
[02:16:54.503 --> 02:16:56.664]  I'll sure try to do that, yes.
[02:16:56.844 --> 02:16:57.905]  Yes, go ahead, sir.
[02:16:58.045 --> 02:16:58.705]  That would be great.
[02:16:59.265 --> 02:17:03.627]  We were told then that we can't handle everything, so there will be the professionals there helping us out.
[02:17:03.687 --> 02:17:06.188]  But we were told we would have to take mental health training.
[02:17:07.029 --> 02:17:13.515]  And to make it palatable to the other pastors, and these are their words now, that we won't call it mental health, we'll call it spiritual care.
[02:17:14.256 --> 02:17:15.858]  And so they've renamed everything.
[02:17:15.898 --> 02:17:19.281]  Instead of mental health and disaster relief, it's spiritual care.
[02:17:19.301 --> 02:17:21.383]  When we get back, we'll get into the forced drugging.
[02:17:22.744 --> 02:17:29.371]  Armed squads with breachers there to brainwash the public with pills to make you submit drugs.
[02:17:30.347 --> 02:17:31.968]  He doesn't get any more Soviet than this.
[02:17:32.028 --> 02:17:32.729]  Stay there, Pastor.
[02:17:32.749 --> 02:17:33.770]  I know I'm ranting.
[02:17:33.810 --> 02:17:35.832]  This is just so upsetting.
[02:17:35.872 --> 02:17:37.253]  This is 11th hour.
[02:17:38.114 --> 02:17:40.556]  Nationwide, it's going on right now.
[02:17:40.576 --> 02:17:42.177]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:42.237 --> 02:17:43.178]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:51.324]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:00.320]  I think.
[02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:30.960]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Redbook.
[02:18:30.981 --> 02:18:32.441]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[02:18:32.481 --> 02:18:35.723]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[02:18:35.743 --> 02:18:36.903]  It includes a history of U.S.
[02:18:36.943 --> 02:18:37.364]  coins.
[02:18:59.301 --> 02:18:59.961]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.733 --> 02:19:31.496]  Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.

[02:19:37.748 --> 02:19:37.808]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.949 --> 02:19:47.970]  The war on terrorism.
[02:19:48.310 --> 02:19:51.092]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:51.372 --> 02:19:55.515]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:55.956 --> 02:19:56.776]  So what do you do?
[02:19:57.097 --> 02:20:01.660]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:02.148 --> 02:20:04.270]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:04.771 --> 02:20:19.465]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:19.505 --> 02:20:26.572]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:20:33.555 --> 02:20:33.755]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:48.023]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:20:48.263 --> 02:20:50.305]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:20:50.445 --> 02:20:57.493]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:20:57.773 --> 02:21:06.322]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:21:06.682 --> 02:21:11.346]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[02:21:33.661 --> 02:21:36.042]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:21:47.591 --> 02:21:58.580]  We're covering a national program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to turn leading pastors, priests, rabbis, you name it, into secret police enforcers.
[02:21:59.361 --> 02:22:01.042]  Gun confiscation martial law.
[02:22:01.082 --> 02:22:11.791]  Remember, in my film Road to Tyranny, I haven't asked the pastor if he's seen this, we have FEMA in Kansas City months before 9-11 saying the Founding Fathers are terrorists, all Christians are terrorists,
[02:22:12.692 --> 02:22:14.413]  Right, and they use all kinds of terms for us.
[02:22:37.004 --> 02:22:46.793]  They told us that in the event of a quarantine, and they were already saying, you don't quarantine for the bird flu, but they're making arrangements for that, they being the groups that we're dealing with now.
[02:22:47.274 --> 02:22:48.875]  They aren't using the term quarantine.
[02:22:49.075 --> 02:22:50.437]  This is the term they're going to be using.
[02:22:50.517 --> 02:22:52.038]  It's called social distancing.
[02:22:52.198 --> 02:22:52.959]  Don't you like that one?
[02:22:54.681 --> 02:22:55.561]  Social distancing.
[02:22:55.722 --> 02:22:58.224]  Well, it's like getting rid of the military as a build-down.
[02:22:58.704 --> 02:23:00.206]  Yes, it is right.
[02:23:00.366 --> 02:23:00.886]  A build-down.
[02:23:00.906 --> 02:23:01.447]  Don't you love that?
[02:23:02.082 --> 02:23:04.444]  Well, you mentioned about drugging, forced drugging.
[02:23:04.464 --> 02:23:05.605]  Can I speak to that one?
[02:23:05.625 --> 02:23:07.106]  Because that was brought up in one of our meetings.
[02:23:07.246 --> 02:23:08.167]  Please, Pastor.
[02:23:08.347 --> 02:23:18.916]  They said that the role of the health district, locally and countywide, would be to provide public information, prevent the spread of disease, and in the event of any outbreak, bioterrorists, whatever they have,
[02:23:19.346 --> 02:23:22.208]  That there would be a mass vaccination and prophylaxis.
[02:23:22.468 --> 02:23:29.373]  And they have a term, they have a program called, this is national, this is not just our local, Pills and People's Palms in 48 hours.
[02:23:29.573 --> 02:23:32.555]  PPP in 48 hours.
[02:23:32.575 --> 02:23:37.938]  Walmart has volunteered, going back four years ago, to be the distribution centers for all this.
[02:23:37.978 --> 02:23:38.619]  Exactly right.
[02:23:38.659 --> 02:23:42.141]  We were told that it's the Walmart stores, we were told that it's all these other stores.
[02:23:42.859 --> 02:23:47.622]  They're getting involved in this because there's such a horrendous fear of the bird flu.
[02:23:48.202 --> 02:24:00.210]  And so immediately we went from the focus on some type of natural disaster to the bird flu, and they're pushing up their timeline to get everything done by August 31st.
[02:24:00.270 --> 02:24:04.453]  And so they're having a flurry of these meetings locally here and elsewhere.
[02:24:05.562 --> 02:24:10.364]  The gentleman who trained us confirmed that by saying that this is the man who works for FEMA.
[02:24:10.484 --> 02:24:11.464]  He's on their payroll.
[02:24:11.944 --> 02:24:17.546]  He said he was just at a meeting in North Carolina where 26 states were represented.
[02:24:18.267 --> 02:24:26.029]  And he goes, we're very excited that this program, pastor training, mental health, all this, is getting down to the county level in at least 13,250 counties nationwide.
[02:24:28.430 --> 02:24:29.030]  We're good to go.
[02:24:29.050 --> 02:24:29.810]  We're good to go.
[02:24:52.396 --> 02:24:58.940]  They're not going to play games, with me at least, but it's interesting to be there and listen to this information that they're spitting out.
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:01.021]  Any other key things they're saying?
[02:25:01.582 --> 02:25:10.847]  Because I want to make the point, they can have a small bird for release, create the hysteria, lock down a state, then claim it was successful, to beta test it for the next big event that will be the big one.
[02:25:11.127 --> 02:25:11.768]  Exactly right.
[02:25:11.808 --> 02:25:19.953]  They mentioned that one of the reasons that they're really pushing pastors to get on board is that we can help recruit other people for Citizen Corps.
[02:25:20.653 --> 02:25:24.394]  And Citizen Corps will be the guys who are going around checking doors kind of thing.
[02:25:25.114 --> 02:25:36.576]  And they said the benefit of being in Citizen Corps for pastors and also locals is this, that will put you on a higher list for antivirals or vaccinations.
[02:25:36.717 --> 02:25:41.378]  In other words, if you volunteer, you get vaccinated and get your pills first, and so does your family.
[02:25:41.638 --> 02:25:43.438]  You don't volunteer, you don't get the drugs.
[02:25:44.011 --> 02:25:48.997]  And more than that, you'll get the food shipments during an emergency if you've got the little I'm a Minion badge.
[02:25:49.778 --> 02:25:52.361]  And at the same time... Please continue.
[02:25:52.461 --> 02:25:53.162]  No, sure.
[02:25:53.222 --> 02:25:55.544]  You're exactly right, because they talked about these centers.
[02:25:55.564 --> 02:25:56.906]  They're not calling them relocation.
[02:25:57.727 --> 02:26:01.992]  Three months ago, it was relocation quarantine centers, and now it's community aid centers.
[02:26:02.575 --> 02:26:04.876]  And these are going to be activated at the local schools.
[02:26:05.036 --> 02:26:07.477]  And they said this is where the Citizen Corps volunteers will be.
[02:26:07.497 --> 02:26:15.201]  And that's why they're putting fences up around schools, making them mini prisons with cameras, doors that automatically lock down with wire mesh in the windows.
[02:26:15.261 --> 02:26:15.982]  These are prisons.
[02:26:16.202 --> 02:26:16.362]  Right.
[02:26:16.482 --> 02:26:24.846]  And where we are, they have the roads circuited off that in the event of some kind of quarantine, some relocation, they know what roads to use.
[02:26:25.623 --> 02:26:30.625]  This is bombshell after bombshell, and the article we write will put all these bullet points.
[02:26:30.885 --> 02:26:33.246]  They already have the choke points and the lockdowns ready.
[02:26:33.386 --> 02:26:39.409]  Yes, they do, and this is one of the more frightening things, is that they're passing this off as for the common good.
[02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:51.673]  It's the typical garbage drivel that you've heard all these years, but they're so bold about it, and now when they're bringing pastors in, there's so many pastors who are so desperate for church growth at any cost that they're jumping on the bandwagon here.
[02:26:51.713 --> 02:26:53.074]  They want their name out front in this.
[02:26:53.374 --> 02:26:54.635]  They want their church name out front.
[02:26:54.655 --> 02:27:00.799]  Well, I want to add that when the economy implodes by design, many people will be forced to take jobs with a paltry payment.
[02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:07.124]  Instead of make works like Roosevelt had building dams, the make work is going to be little armed security guards.
[02:27:07.164 --> 02:27:07.624]  Yes, it is.
[02:27:08.485 --> 02:27:09.245]  Stay there, Pastor.
[02:27:09.265 --> 02:27:11.847]  I want to continue with all the other facets of this.
[02:27:11.867 --> 02:27:15.029]  We're going to get a huge report out on this tonight or tomorrow.
[02:27:15.370 --> 02:27:16.671]  You're faxing us the documents.
[02:27:16.691 --> 02:27:21.034]  We have some of the other documents as well and some of the national announcements about this program.
[02:27:22.430 --> 02:27:24.933]  All around you, how many of your preachers are on the payroll?
[02:27:25.334 --> 02:27:30.259]  How many are being brainwashed to tell you to submit to gun confiscation and martial law?
[02:27:31.140 --> 02:27:33.062]  You wonder why your preacher's telling you all this stuff?
[02:27:33.082 --> 02:27:34.183]  Because they're on the payroll.
[02:27:35.585 --> 02:27:36.486]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.966 --> 02:27:38.568]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.588 --> 02:27:42.172]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.578 --> 02:27:50.041]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:27:50.301 --> 02:27:53.883]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:27:54.023 --> 02:28:02.168]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:28:02.408 --> 02:28:08.051]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:28:08.351 --> 02:28:13.573]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:28:13.853 --> 02:28:15.934]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[02:28:16.194 --> 02:28:28.338]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:28:28.578 --> 02:28:33.001]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:28:33.222 --> 02:28:34.182]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:34.362 --> 02:28:35.984]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:28:36.104 --> 02:28:37.905]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:28:38.165 --> 02:28:38.626]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:28:38.646 --> 02:28:38.846]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:28:46.124 --> 02:28:51.086]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:28:51.406 --> 02:28:56.829]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.869 --> 02:29:01.151]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.491 --> 02:29:04.513]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.833 --> 02:29:08.275]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.595 --> 02:29:17.960]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:21.702]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:21.942 --> 02:29:29.046]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:29:29.306 --> 02:29:30.667]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[02:29:45.373 --> 02:29:49.415]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want the milk.
[02:29:49.635 --> 02:29:53.036]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:53.216 --> 02:29:56.658]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:56.934 --> 02:30:00.197]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:00.217 --> 02:30:05.681]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:30:05.721 --> 02:30:15.349]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:15.489 --> 02:30:16.830]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:22.255]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[02:30:22.651 --> 02:30:27.196]  If you'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:27.276 --> 02:30:28.658]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:28.818 --> 02:30:32.682]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:32.742 --> 02:30:33.563]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:48.691 --> 02:30:54.713]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.333 --> 02:30:58.335]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.535 --> 02:31:07.738]  Callers, we're going to open the phones up here in a few minutes for specific questions about martial law and the takeover program we're discussing.
[02:31:08.448 --> 02:31:09.989]  With this pastor from Ohio.
[02:31:10.109 --> 02:31:10.989]  We have the documents.
[02:31:11.009 --> 02:31:11.950]  We're getting more of the documents.
[02:31:11.970 --> 02:31:13.890]  We have mainstream news articles about the program.
[02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:19.513]  But we're giving you the inside scoop and the details, and I'm telling you it all checks out with the information I have in the past.
[02:31:20.333 --> 02:31:21.253]  We're going to write an article.
[02:31:21.554 --> 02:31:33.719]  I think it should have the title like National Secret FEMA Program Recruiting Preachers to Prepare and Pacify Public for Martial Law.
[02:31:37.463 --> 02:31:41.644]  And then sub-headline, Relocation Camps, Forced Inoculations.
[02:31:41.664 --> 02:31:49.365]  These are the new... This ties into the... This ties into the Houston Chronicle, the Emergency FEMA Camps.
[02:31:49.965 --> 02:31:54.786]  All of this, we need to put in the article, all the past FEMA and state emergency manuals.
[02:31:55.066 --> 02:31:59.547]  We need to put in there the clip from Marshall Law, where the firefighter and police are in the group.
[02:32:00.007 --> 02:32:00.827]  They're in Kansas City.
[02:32:00.867 --> 02:32:01.747]  We're on the air right now.
[02:32:01.807 --> 02:32:03.248]  God bless KCXL.
[02:32:03.268 --> 02:32:04.048]  Folks should support them.
[02:32:04.328 --> 02:32:05.588]  One of our oldest and best affiliates.
[02:32:06.008 --> 02:32:06.689]  I think we're good to go.
[02:32:28.306 --> 02:32:37.648]  To print off the documents, to print off the news article we're going to write, to print off the mainstream news articles, to put them in folders, to take it to their preacher, and if the preacher doesn't respond in a week, say, are you part of this?
[02:32:37.668 --> 02:32:38.208]  Have you heard of this?
[02:32:38.228 --> 02:32:39.088]  What are you going to do on this?
[02:32:39.408 --> 02:32:49.270]  To stand up in the church to make up 100 folders or 50 folders or 500, however many are in your church, hand them out, stand up and yell and say, argue on the payroll!
[02:32:49.470 --> 02:32:50.191]  What are you doing?
[02:32:50.231 --> 02:32:52.031]  Why are you being a Judas goat?
[02:32:52.531 --> 02:32:54.151]  And I mean, break that church up.
[02:32:54.251 --> 02:32:55.072]  Leave that church.
[02:32:55.392 --> 02:32:56.672]  This is an emergency!
[02:32:58.115 --> 02:33:01.456]  Now, I'm actually giving orders here to my webmasters and writers right now.
[02:33:01.496 --> 02:33:03.937]  That's how much I work, how fast I work, how much I work.
[02:33:03.957 --> 02:33:06.658]  We literally have to combine that into the broadcast.
[02:33:07.419 --> 02:33:08.699]  Paul Watson, I know you're listening.
[02:33:09.099 --> 02:33:10.360]  You do such a fabulous job.
[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:12.101]  I want a huge, detailed report on this.
[02:33:12.121 --> 02:33:14.762]  I know you're busy writing a book right now that we're doing.
[02:33:14.782 --> 02:33:17.283]  I know you're busy updating the site, doing customer service, everything.
[02:33:17.363 --> 02:33:17.943]  I need more.
[02:33:19.779 --> 02:33:21.941]  I mean, you understand, folks, I love my family.
[02:33:22.041 --> 02:33:23.221]  I realize this is a takeover.
[02:33:23.462 --> 02:33:25.803]  Going back to the pastor from Ohio, we're not giving you his name.
[02:33:26.384 --> 02:33:27.644]  He's been made a leader in this group.
[02:33:27.684 --> 02:33:29.446]  He's there spying on all this for us.
[02:33:29.466 --> 02:33:30.126]  God bless him.
[02:33:30.526 --> 02:33:31.847]  He's a modern Paul Revere.
[02:33:31.867 --> 02:33:32.928]  I call him Pastor Revere.
[02:33:33.508 --> 02:33:43.735]  Pastor, the statements I've just made, do you agree with that idea of getting people, getting their facts together, going to their pastors, assistant pastors, and finding out if this is going on?
[02:33:43.755 --> 02:33:48.298]  In fact, at first, maybe being friendly about it before you give them the document and to see if this is going on.
[02:33:48.598 --> 02:33:49.499]  Pastor, do you agree with that?
[02:33:50.319 --> 02:33:51.980]  I think it works well.
[02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:56.561]  In our county, it would work real well because I have the names of those pastors who signed up and made the pledge.
[02:33:56.662 --> 02:33:57.962]  That would really help us out.
[02:33:58.142 --> 02:33:59.403]  That's my advantage.
[02:33:59.423 --> 02:34:03.624]  I think it would be a great idea to put something together so people can confront their pastors.
[02:34:03.704 --> 02:34:09.006]  They should know already how they feel about it, but sometimes these things sneak in on people.
[02:34:09.686 --> 02:34:14.788]  Pastor, I have friends who attend big Baptist churches in Austin, two big ones.
[02:34:14.928 --> 02:34:17.229]  Two years ago, three years ago, one of them brought me a document
[02:34:17.769 --> 02:34:25.176]  And it said, during the upcoming election, this was like in early 2004, this was about two years ago, do not talk about politics at lunch.
[02:34:25.217 --> 02:34:29.080]  Do not talk about politics with anyone in Sunday school or anywhere in the church.
[02:34:29.140 --> 02:34:29.961]  It is not proper.
[02:34:30.241 --> 02:34:34.666]  And then now they're being told that the preachers are getting up and saying, we must submit to the government.
[02:34:34.706 --> 02:34:35.827]  Bad things are coming.
[02:34:36.127 --> 02:34:37.008]  They know best.
[02:34:38.047 --> 02:34:39.328]  New Orleans was good.
[02:34:39.908 --> 02:34:41.210]  I mean, this is really going on.
[02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:43.272]  Yeah, well, these people need to get out of those churches.
[02:34:43.852 --> 02:34:45.254]  They aren't going to change anything like that.
[02:34:45.274 --> 02:34:47.616]  They fire a pastor, it's already there.
[02:34:47.676 --> 02:34:50.920]  But those things are just ridiculous.
[02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:51.961]  We have those guys here.
[02:34:51.981 --> 02:34:53.742]  It happens here as well, too.
[02:34:53.762 --> 02:34:55.164]  We're in farm country, basically.
[02:34:56.128 --> 02:35:00.214]  And imagine, the pastors led the Revolutionary War against the Redcoats.
[02:35:00.574 --> 02:35:02.877]  Now they're going to lead the destruction of America.
[02:35:03.218 --> 02:35:06.422]  Well, I think the people have failed to know our history.
[02:35:06.843 --> 02:35:08.765]  Those in power know it all too well.
[02:35:08.925 --> 02:35:10.167]  And they know who to subvert.
[02:35:10.307 --> 02:35:11.509]  They know who to co-opt.
[02:35:12.191 --> 02:35:17.094]  Well, under the faith-based initiative, $10 billion a year to start to pay off churches, are they promising money down the road during an emergency?
[02:35:30.821 --> 02:35:31.001]  No.
[02:35:31.061 --> 02:35:40.789]  They haven't even mentioned anything like that, but I'll tell you now, there are several guys who are involved who are already getting money from the faith-based thing, and I mean as far as getting the outward money.
[02:35:40.849 --> 02:35:45.692]  They've been turned on to grants by our government and said, look, this is where you can get your grants for this program.
[02:35:45.752 --> 02:35:48.154]  So when you do this, the skids get greased?
[02:35:48.374 --> 02:35:49.295]  Yeah, exactly right.
[02:35:49.315 --> 02:35:56.020]  Well, they're already going to give us the first line for drugs if we do it right, so the money's not going to be an object to them at all.
[02:35:56.540 --> 02:35:57.302]  We're good to go.
[02:36:07.375 --> 02:36:09.217]  Well, I'm waiting for them to use the term vanguard.
[02:36:09.237 --> 02:36:10.118]  I'm waiting for that to come up.
[02:36:10.578 --> 02:36:11.900]  I don't think it'll come up eventually.
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.104]  Well, Pastor, I've been ranting and raving here, but I think we all should be upset.
[02:36:17.285 --> 02:36:19.287]  Can we get into the loyalty oath required?
[02:36:19.687 --> 02:36:24.132]  I have an article here out of loyalty oath required of Illinois FEMA volunteers.
[02:36:24.432 --> 02:36:27.475]  They're now getting students, politicians, pastors.
[02:36:27.515 --> 02:36:29.717]  Can you get into the loyalty oath that you were given?
[02:36:31.195 --> 02:36:34.776]  Same loyalty oath, and a lot of us rebelled against that one.
[02:36:34.876 --> 02:36:39.298]  A lot of us being those who just heard about it, didn't think it was a good idea.
[02:36:39.498 --> 02:36:42.079]  But what they've said is you don't have to make the pledge.
[02:36:42.179 --> 02:36:44.199]  All you've got to do is make an affirmation.
[02:36:44.539 --> 02:36:45.460]  And everybody was happy.
[02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:46.120]  I'm not kidding.
[02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:48.221]  And the pledge, basically, if you've got a copy of it.
[02:36:48.401 --> 02:36:49.321]  But that's what Hitler did.
[02:36:49.341 --> 02:36:51.102]  They just lined him up and said, raise your right hand.
[02:36:51.222 --> 02:36:52.182]  Sure, just raise your right hand.
[02:36:52.222 --> 02:36:53.122]  You can say affirm.
[02:36:53.162 --> 02:36:55.043]  You can say pledge.
[02:36:55.063 --> 02:36:56.323]  You can say I agree.
[02:36:56.343 --> 02:36:58.244]  Anything you want to say that makes you happy.
[02:36:58.964 --> 02:37:01.327]  Because some Christians know they should be taking oaths.
[02:37:01.387 --> 02:37:03.409]  Well, they go against the oath and call it something else.
[02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:04.691]  It's a pledge.
[02:37:04.751 --> 02:37:05.932]  It's an honoring of the oath.
[02:37:05.972 --> 02:37:07.634]  It's all lawyer word games.
[02:37:07.694 --> 02:37:10.197]  Again, they call the Patriot Act the Patriot Act.
[02:37:10.217 --> 02:37:13.060]  They call drugging half the kids New Freedom.
[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:14.601]  It's ridiculous.
[02:37:14.982 --> 02:37:16.063]  Well, this loyalty oath,
[02:37:16.713 --> 02:37:23.297]  Basically says that while you're on duty under FEMA protection, that we get workers' comp through that.
[02:37:23.317 --> 02:37:37.905]  So if we're injured in disaster relief or someone shoots us because we're trying to get in their farm, that we're covered and that we promise not to overthrow the government or actually participate while we're on the payroll, which is basically the payroll is workers' comp.
[02:37:38.465 --> 02:37:45.269]  Now, the problem with that, of course, you can see as far as I go, you're not supposed to be with any group that advocates the overthrow of the government while you're on
[02:37:46.223 --> 02:37:47.444]  I want to back up just a moment.
[02:38:03.178 --> 02:38:05.900]  Notice at first it's, hey, come on in, it's for hurricanes.
[02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:07.741]  Then, oh, it's for bird flu.
[02:38:07.841 --> 02:38:12.945]  And then by a month into it, oh, it's for people that want to fight us or overthrow us.
[02:38:13.325 --> 02:38:17.708]  What is the government planning that they know there's going to be mass physical revolts?
[02:38:18.509 --> 02:38:22.572]  You know, I talked with Brother Butch about this and just briefly mentioned this.
[02:38:22.612 --> 02:38:24.013]  You know, it's like Y2K.
[02:38:24.173 --> 02:38:27.275]  Everybody was happy when nothing happened, but actually something did happen.
[02:38:27.315 --> 02:38:28.816]  The government got just what they wanted.
[02:38:29.951 --> 02:38:30.812]  Everybody's online.
[02:38:30.872 --> 02:38:31.632]  Everybody's networked.
[02:38:31.772 --> 02:38:32.512]  Everybody's being watched.
[02:38:32.532 --> 02:38:35.974]  Well, they're going to do the same thing with this if they don't take it next.
[02:38:36.114 --> 02:38:39.815]  They'll be happy with 70% to 80% of what they want now.
[02:38:40.376 --> 02:38:41.876]  And people are sitting scared.
[02:38:41.956 --> 02:38:45.018]  I mean, I raise chickens, and I have them in my backyard.
[02:38:45.238 --> 02:38:47.279]  We don't live in a subdivision.
[02:38:47.319 --> 02:38:47.999]  We live in the country.
[02:38:48.559 --> 02:38:51.441]  But there are people already panicked because we have chickens in my backyard.
[02:38:51.561 --> 02:38:52.742]  And they're calling the authorities.
[02:38:52.943 --> 02:38:53.283]  I'm serious.
[02:38:53.563 --> 02:38:54.864]  Because they know who to call.
[02:38:55.224 --> 02:38:56.085]  They've watched the news.
[02:38:56.125 --> 02:38:56.685]  They know all the stuff.
[02:38:56.705 --> 02:38:58.727]  And it's about bringing in an atmosphere of fear.
[02:38:58.947 --> 02:38:59.628]  That's what it is.
[02:38:59.648 --> 02:39:01.089]  Burn flu doesn't even need to break out.
[02:39:01.109 --> 02:39:02.870]  It's just always ratcheting it up.
[02:39:03.210 --> 02:39:06.453]  Any smoke screen to create the secret tattletale squads.
[02:39:06.553 --> 02:39:12.855]  Right, and we live in a place where people should come to your door and say, hey, I live next door, down the road, how you doing, blah, blah, blah.
[02:39:13.135 --> 02:39:14.095]  They don't do that anymore.
[02:39:14.135 --> 02:39:19.296]  That's being taken away for this fear, and people are now resting upon the authorities, and they're everywhere.
[02:39:19.316 --> 02:39:25.538]  I mean, these people are everywhere, knocking on doors, telling people, hey, your neighbor had a complaint against this, this, this.
[02:39:25.618 --> 02:39:30.759]  It's just getting out of hand, but this is what people want, a dependency upon the authorities.
[02:39:31.477 --> 02:39:35.792]  Pastor, please get more into this hysteria, this tattletaling that's going on.
[02:39:36.454 --> 02:39:38.080]  I'm sorry, say that again.
[02:39:38.931 --> 02:39:40.092]  Cut off here by a call.
[02:39:40.572 --> 02:39:41.673]  I mean, get more into that.
[02:39:42.533 --> 02:39:43.814]  Who's knocking on doors?
[02:39:43.854 --> 02:39:44.555]  What's going on?
[02:39:44.955 --> 02:40:01.906]  What's happening is that neighbors complain against neighbors, and then they call the local sheriff, or they call the health department, or they call some other agency, and they're knocking on doors already, and people are already of the mindset accepting that kind of authority and that kind of law enforcement.
[02:40:02.066 --> 02:40:02.767]  So what I'm saying is,
[02:40:03.379 --> 02:40:07.082]  When it comes down to a real disaster, that's who they're going to turn to.
[02:40:07.102 --> 02:40:09.564]  They're already being told, don't handle things yourself.
[02:40:09.984 --> 02:40:11.625]  Get rid of the neighborhood quality.
[02:40:11.665 --> 02:40:14.347]  Well, this is all just drilling us for martial law.
[02:40:14.627 --> 02:40:14.848]  Yes.
[02:40:14.888 --> 02:40:20.852]  Well, you know, I'm sure you're quite aware that they have a policy called, a program called Peer-to-Peer.
[02:40:21.112 --> 02:40:22.313]  And that was under FEMA.
[02:40:22.493 --> 02:40:24.715]  It was under DHS, Department of Homeland Security.
[02:40:25.310 --> 02:40:37.435]  And now it's been turned over to this national volunteer organization in disaster relief where they train neighbors or they train a family or a home in one neighborhood to pretty much oversee the neighborhood.
[02:40:37.475 --> 02:40:38.576]  And that's called peer-to-peer.
[02:40:39.056 --> 02:40:43.178]  And what they're doing is they're training more or less brown shirts to sit in a neighborhood.
[02:40:43.478 --> 02:40:45.959]  If something goes wrong, they're to go and talk to the neighbors.
[02:40:46.119 --> 02:40:47.960]  They're like the neighborhood watch groups.
[02:40:48.553 --> 02:40:54.076]  Well, Pastor, four years ago I didn't believe it, and then I confirmed it in federal payment orders.
[02:40:54.716 --> 02:41:01.479]  Prima Cop, the former head of the KGB, was hired by Homeland Security before it even got funding.
[02:41:02.299 --> 02:41:06.982]  At the same time, Marcus Wolfe, the former head of the Stasi, was hired for consulting.
[02:41:07.502 --> 02:41:08.542]  This isn't a joke.
[02:41:08.642 --> 02:41:10.183]  This is really happening.
[02:41:10.423 --> 02:41:10.923]  Yes, it is.
[02:41:11.844 --> 02:41:13.064]  Yes, it is happening, and it's not...
[02:41:15.146 --> 02:41:17.288]  It's not being hidden anymore.
[02:41:17.328 --> 02:41:19.009]  This makes the front page of our paper here.
[02:41:19.389 --> 02:41:22.532]  So the neighbors aren't concerned about open borders.
[02:41:22.552 --> 02:41:24.533]  They don't mind buying chicken at the store.
[02:41:24.593 --> 02:41:25.614]  There's no bird flu here.
[02:41:26.074 --> 02:41:29.197]  They're just running around afraid of chickens hopping around in your backyard.
[02:41:29.537 --> 02:41:31.999]  That and they're afraid of everything.
[02:41:32.059 --> 02:41:34.481]  I mean, we live in rural Ohio.
[02:41:34.521 --> 02:41:37.583]  We're talking about everybody has some kind of weapon.
[02:41:37.663 --> 02:41:41.286]  And now it's creeping up here where we need a little more gun control.
[02:41:41.326 --> 02:41:42.587]  We need a little more of this.
[02:41:42.627 --> 02:41:43.788]  And this isn't a place where
[02:41:44.249 --> 02:41:47.691]  We are pretty much independent, fiercely independent, I guess, what we used to be.
[02:41:48.451 --> 02:41:59.037]  What we're seeing in here is happening all over the country, and I believe it's just a mindset being produced by years and years of consciously getting on television, making things look the worst.
[02:41:59.077 --> 02:42:02.118]  People are starting to buy it now because now it's coming home.
[02:42:02.558 --> 02:42:05.900]  People can stop guns from coming to the front door, but the flu, they have a problem with that.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.162]  The pastor, a lot of people call it the sixth sense.
[02:42:09.282 --> 02:42:10.423]  I call it discernment.
[02:42:10.703 --> 02:42:11.043]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:22.675]  And the globalists play a trick, and I want to see if you can, you sound like a very intelligent man, probably smarter than I am, so you can probably get what I'm saying if I'm able to put it out there properly.
[02:42:22.695 --> 02:42:25.136]  Let me try to phrase this the best I can.
[02:42:26.613 --> 02:42:29.374]  People deep down know something's wrong.
[02:42:29.614 --> 02:42:31.255]  They know we're in great danger.
[02:42:31.695 --> 02:42:37.797]  The government, psychological warfare experts, know that we know something's wrong, and the problem is them, the globalists.
[02:42:38.397 --> 02:42:43.159]  And so they put out these fake things, which deep down we know are fake.
[02:42:43.914 --> 02:42:44.454]  Exactly right.
[02:42:44.535 --> 02:42:46.716]  And that puts the government in charge.
[02:42:46.736 --> 02:42:46.836]  Yes.
[02:43:08.052 --> 02:43:10.654]  A spirit of fear and enslavement.
[02:43:10.835 --> 02:43:11.415]  Yes, it is.
[02:43:11.535 --> 02:43:15.399]  And this is what you're exactly right.
[02:43:15.459 --> 02:43:16.621]  This is what the government does.
[02:43:16.681 --> 02:43:18.663]  This is the powers that be.
[02:43:18.903 --> 02:43:24.169]  They can't enforce their authority, but they sure can win the hearts and minds of people by putting a fear into them.
[02:43:24.773 --> 02:43:29.598]  And they misdirect it, and it gets put on someone else, and people feel like they've accomplished something.
[02:43:30.039 --> 02:43:34.744]  When they see a sheriff show up at a door for a minor infraction, they know they can do that with a major infraction.
[02:43:35.024 --> 02:43:40.610]  And I'm not saying you shouldn't call the authorities sometimes, but my goodness, these people do this all the time to everybody in this country.
[02:43:41.230 --> 02:43:43.091]  And they think that's the way it should be.
[02:43:43.111 --> 02:43:47.152]  So our government has misdirected it, and they've stolen that power.
[02:43:47.272 --> 02:43:53.954]  And now they're going to have the real Animal ID Act where there are $2,000 a day fines and forges, microchips and everything.
[02:43:54.014 --> 02:43:54.954]  It's really happening.
[02:43:55.354 --> 02:44:02.136]  We have our 4-H department here in our county and our state saying that's the best thing to come along, to chip our animals.
[02:44:02.876 --> 02:44:06.297]  And we have kids, students who have been raised.
[02:44:06.357 --> 02:44:09.138]  We homeschool our kids that we do things very independent-minded.
[02:44:09.727 --> 02:44:11.428]  And no one's going to chip anything we have.
[02:44:11.968 --> 02:44:16.090]  And the rule is, by 2008, your animals aren't chipped and logged.
[02:44:16.170 --> 02:44:17.151]  You don't show them at the fair.
[02:44:17.351 --> 02:44:18.352]  So kids are out of 4-H.
[02:44:19.392 --> 02:44:22.854]  But our authorities just think it's the greatest thing on two feet.
[02:44:22.914 --> 02:44:23.654]  They just love it.
[02:44:24.114 --> 02:44:27.156]  So I don't understand what's going on, but that's what they do.
[02:44:27.296 --> 02:44:28.697]  And they win that authority over.
[02:44:28.817 --> 02:44:32.679]  Well, in simple psychology, they send the feds in to give them a grant, and they say, you're smart.
[02:44:32.719 --> 02:44:33.539]  You're good.
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:34.940]  You're going to run this.
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:36.321]  And the person goes, I am?
[02:44:37.435 --> 02:44:38.936]  I want to take some calls.
[02:44:39.196 --> 02:44:40.597]  Who's up first for the pastor?
[02:44:43.379 --> 02:44:45.520]  Scott and Casey, you're on the air with the pastor.
[02:44:45.540 --> 02:44:45.940]  Go ahead.
[02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:47.241]  Hey, Alex.
[02:44:47.361 --> 02:44:48.221]  First time caller.
[02:44:48.321 --> 02:44:50.643]  I appreciate what you're doing there, pastor.
[02:44:51.443 --> 02:44:53.685]  Exposing what's really going on here.
[02:44:54.545 --> 02:44:57.247]  Do you happen to have any kind of idea what timeline?
[02:44:58.087 --> 02:45:02.290]  I know you said they're trying to get this all implemented by August 31st, I believe you said.
[02:45:02.310 --> 02:45:02.610]  Mm-hmm.
[02:45:03.601 --> 02:45:17.891]  I mean, it seems like I've heard people say some kind of attack on Iran in October and maybe some kind of catalyst here that would, you know, start this into the process.
[02:45:19.832 --> 02:45:25.116]  I know with, it seems like there's many drills running the first part of June.
[02:45:25.136 --> 02:45:29.979]  I know they're planning on detonating a large nuke out in Las Vegas.
[02:45:30.059 --> 02:45:32.061]  It's supposed to be seen from Las Vegas and
[02:45:33.276 --> 02:45:34.097]  That's conventional.
[02:45:34.518 --> 02:45:35.358]  That's conventional.
[02:45:35.839 --> 02:45:37.280]  It's still big.
[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:52.753]  Well, I think that's going to be shown to Iran as a deterrent of what's going to happen to them if they don't stop their nuke program or their oil bourse program that they just... Let me add something to what you're saying, and then you can go on and the pastor can comment.
[02:45:53.774 --> 02:45:57.918]  They have deadlines, and then those come and go, and then there's the next goal, the next goal.
[02:45:58.378 --> 02:46:00.480]  So a lot of times it doesn't mean that the deadline of...
[02:46:01.744 --> 02:46:03.625]  August whatever means that's when it's going to happen.
[02:46:03.926 --> 02:46:07.388]  That means that that's the deadline for part one of the program.
[02:46:07.768 --> 02:46:09.109]  Then they'll just keep expanding it.
[02:46:09.850 --> 02:46:11.571]  Exactly right, and that's what I wanted to comment on.
[02:46:12.952 --> 02:46:23.658]  Our local EMA director said August 31st is when all the counties in the United States are supposed to be online with their disaster relief program, and that includes the training, the completed training of pastors.
[02:46:24.178 --> 02:46:34.824]  And she goes, we don't expect anything to happen until October or November with the bird flu, but then that's an interesting date for you to bring up, Scott, to say that we're talking October or something there.
[02:46:35.605 --> 02:46:37.166]  There's so much going around, but they...
[02:46:37.666 --> 02:46:42.507]  They just want things in place, just like Alex has said, so that they take that next step.
[02:46:42.567 --> 02:46:53.770]  And once we're happy with August 31st, hey, we have a disaster plan in effect, thank God we don't have to use it, that's not the right attitude, because they're going to go for more, and this is where it has to be stopped, right here at the beginning.
[02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:56.450]  Because once they accomplish something, they're going to keep pushing for more.
[02:46:56.470 --> 02:46:59.511]  Well, I predict Phase 2 will be identifying terrorists.
[02:46:59.891 --> 02:47:00.991]  Exactly.
[02:47:01.011 --> 02:47:01.832]  Oh, they told you that?
[02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:03.552]  Exactly right, because they're looking at,
[02:47:04.543 --> 02:47:09.851]  We're having the second part of the training in June, and that's where we deal with crowd control kind of issues.
[02:47:10.692 --> 02:47:11.573]  That's my term.
[02:47:11.613 --> 02:47:14.257]  Their term is unruly people who won't follow directions.
[02:47:15.066 --> 02:47:19.149]  ...with crowd control, and that's where they're going to talk about suspected bioterrorism.
[02:47:19.189 --> 02:47:21.450]  Because we're in farm country, they're looking at animals and crops.
[02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:24.572]  Oh, yes, there's just terrorists everywhere to launch bioattacks.
[02:47:24.592 --> 02:47:27.754]  They want to come right here to my little county and do their thing.
[02:47:28.114 --> 02:47:31.516]  We just laugh about it, you know, but I understand why they want to do it.
[02:47:31.536 --> 02:47:33.357]  Well, the British government released foot and mouth.
[02:47:33.397 --> 02:47:35.679]  That's admitted, back of the paper, but it's admitted.
[02:47:36.319 --> 02:47:42.203]  Sure, and that's something that they were really hot on with hoof and mouth disease and saying that if that breaks out here...
[02:47:42.938 --> 02:47:44.379]  He said, you're going to see a quarantine.
[02:47:44.419 --> 02:47:45.419]  Nobody's seen a quarantine.
[02:47:45.439 --> 02:47:48.440]  Well, they use that to get states to pass martial law provisions.
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:53.562]  Then it's SARS, then it's smallpox, then it's bird flu.
[02:47:53.602 --> 02:47:55.643]  It's always some new crises until they really do it.
[02:47:55.903 --> 02:48:00.805]  Right, and the trainer has referred to the fact that laws are already in effect now.
[02:48:02.898 --> 02:48:08.043]  That it would just take a call from the local FEMA director, the EMA director, to get things started.
[02:48:08.063 --> 02:48:10.245]  That's page 76 of Homeland Security.
[02:48:10.305 --> 02:48:11.406]  Yeah, it's very, very simple.
[02:48:11.426 --> 02:48:14.069]  It's already there, and they're happy with that kind of status.
[02:48:14.409 --> 02:48:17.072]  They enjoy that power, and it is up to them.
[02:48:17.592 --> 02:48:20.735]  These are sick people, and of course, they're going to have no future either.
[02:48:20.775 --> 02:48:26.601]  These fools will later beat their breasts wishing, crying they'd done something.
[02:48:26.941 --> 02:48:27.142]  Yes.
[02:48:28.002 --> 02:48:32.024]  Serving evil is always very destructive, especially to those that are active in it.
[02:48:32.465 --> 02:48:33.365]  You think you're going to be safe?
[02:48:33.625 --> 02:48:35.366]  See, people have this subconscious fear.
[02:48:35.787 --> 02:48:39.329]  They know the government's evil, and the government goes, yes, you've got a fear because of terrorism.
[02:48:39.589 --> 02:48:40.529]  We're going to save you.
[02:48:40.909 --> 02:48:41.510]  Thank you, caller.
[02:48:41.530 --> 02:48:43.391]  We'll be right back with the pastor's final segment.

[02:52:11.117 --> 02:52:24.846]  Before I take a call from Keith, Indiana, for the pastor that joins us, blowing the whistle on this Soviet-style secret police operation, recruiting our pastors to pacify the public for martial law and gun confiscation, forced inoculation, forced drugging,
[02:52:26.494 --> 02:52:32.056]  I want to encourage everyone to come to our big 9-11 Truth Symposium as we expose 9-11 as an inside job.
[02:52:32.576 --> 02:52:34.537]  June 24th and 25th in Los Angeles.

[02:52:49.343 --> 02:52:50.223]  It's going to be powerful.

[02:53:05.655 --> 02:53:15.879]  Pastor, I want to keep you five minutes to the next hour and then let you go, but I want to take a call here in just a second, but any other key points that we haven't covered that you want to add about the training?
[02:53:15.899 --> 02:53:18.480]  And then my last question I will give you after the break.
[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:24.222]  I want you to answer it after the break, and that is, what some of the other pastors you talk to, are some of them waking up, or are they all just...
[02:53:24.922 --> 02:53:25.443]  I think we're good.
[02:53:46.306 --> 02:53:48.487]  If you're going to use the Bible, just set it down next to you.
[02:53:48.527 --> 02:53:49.527]  Don't really quote from it.
[02:53:49.947 --> 02:53:52.368]  This is not a time to bring Jesus into the situation.
[02:53:52.488 --> 02:53:54.068]  Because they're getting you ready.
[02:53:54.148 --> 02:53:54.328]  Yes.
[02:53:54.948 --> 02:53:57.609]  They're getting you ready to be total federal employees.
[02:53:57.729 --> 02:54:03.330]  And at the top, these are demonic individuals, and they know that that name would probably screw up what they're doing.
[02:54:03.530 --> 02:54:04.250]  Absolutely right.
[02:54:04.411 --> 02:54:04.711]  Hello?
[02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:07.771]  Yes, Pastor, go ahead.
[02:54:07.951 --> 02:54:13.713]  And what frightens me is to see these people, these pastors, sit there and take this and take the training and nod their heads.
[02:54:14.174 --> 02:54:16.495]  And so they're telling you, don't bring the Bible into it.
[02:54:16.775 --> 02:54:18.736]  Yeah, and they're just having a good time with it.
[02:54:18.776 --> 02:54:20.097]  So that's one of the points I wanted to bring up.
[02:54:20.137 --> 02:54:25.019]  There's several things you'll get on the facts, which you're handling in the next five minutes that'll get there.
[02:54:25.099 --> 02:54:30.482]  Several comments I've written down from the instructors, several things they say on the training that pretty much speak to that same issue.
[02:54:32.754 --> 02:54:34.975]  Let me just get the question out now, and then we'll go to the call.
[02:54:34.995 --> 02:54:37.677]  What are other pastors you're around saying?
[02:54:37.717 --> 02:54:40.159]  Are any of them seeing this for what it is, or are they just sucking it up?
[02:54:40.739 --> 02:54:42.780]  Well, the ones who are coming to training, they all love it.
[02:54:43.261 --> 02:54:47.283]  I'm not taking the opportunity to go out and question pastors yet, because I'm still getting information.
[02:54:47.323 --> 02:54:50.565]  I want to go to the meetings as long as I can before I tip my hand.
[02:54:51.666 --> 02:54:53.587]  It still is only May, but we're looking at June.
[02:54:53.888 --> 02:54:55.989]  They're having a disaster drill in June.
[02:54:56.704 --> 02:54:57.244]  Yes, it is.
[02:54:57.324 --> 02:54:59.485]  And so this is what we're looking for.
[02:55:25.191 --> 02:55:26.833]  Holding off talking to the other pastors.
[02:55:26.913 --> 02:55:29.936]  I'm holding off going public here because I don't want too much to go out.
[02:55:29.976 --> 02:55:34.500]  But I'm sure being here on this one and off the Butch Paws program, people are picking it up locally as well.
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:36.301]  So it'll be in time.
[02:55:36.642 --> 02:55:37.863]  Pastors, I've not talked to them.
[02:55:38.223 --> 02:55:40.906]  Just the ones who come to the training, and they're pretty much typical.
[02:55:41.346 --> 02:55:42.727]  How many have been through the training?
[02:55:42.767 --> 02:55:46.110]  And for your town, what percentage of the pastors do they represent?
[02:55:46.130 --> 02:55:49.794]  It started off with, we have about 78 pastors here in the area.
[02:55:51.154 --> 02:55:52.715]  44 responded favorably.
[02:55:52.735 --> 02:55:54.415]  23 went through the training.
[02:55:54.475 --> 02:55:56.596]  And 19 raised their right hand.
[02:55:56.616 --> 02:55:57.316]  So that's where it is.
[02:55:57.736 --> 02:55:59.076]  So we're looking at about 25%.
[02:56:00.077 --> 02:56:00.317]  Right.
[02:56:00.417 --> 02:56:06.418]  And that's a large amount that these people represent churches that are family-based, home-based churches.
[02:56:06.438 --> 02:56:08.019]  So it's there.
[02:56:08.599 --> 02:56:10.259]  They're even going after the little preachers.
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:11.080]  Yes, they are.
[02:56:11.220 --> 02:56:12.200]  They love little preachers.
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:14.941]  Those are the flocks they fear the most.
[02:56:15.781 --> 02:56:16.561]  Judas goats.
[02:56:16.661 --> 02:56:18.722]  Do you agree these people are Judas goats?
[02:56:18.902 --> 02:56:19.382]  Without a doubt.
[02:56:20.316 --> 02:56:21.598]  We'll be back with the final segment.
[02:56:21.618 --> 02:56:23.300]  Take a few calls for the pastor.
[02:56:25.322 --> 02:56:30.209]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
