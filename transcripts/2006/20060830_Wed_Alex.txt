[00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.244]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:07.985]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:09.786]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:11.267]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:12.928]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:17.351]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.893]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.314]  Music
[00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:37.125]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:40.867]  Thank you for joining us today on this Wednesday edition.
[00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:43.409]  It is August 30, 2006.
[00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.232]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:59.461]  George Humphreys, former Austin City Council member, 9-11 truth activist, researcher, author, documentary filmmaker, will be joining us in studio in the second hour.
[00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:00.642]  We're good to go.
[00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:00.982]  I think?
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.841]  We're good to go.
[00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:20.661]  We're good to go.
[00:01:40.572 --> 00:01:48.838]  Haratz is reporting that a top general has now been named for possible war with Iran.
[00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:50.799]  That is their headline.
[00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.402]  Joel Skousen, World Affairs Brief, has got a good report out here.
[00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:58.084]  Target Iran, here we go again.
[00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:03.748]  Meanwhile, Israel buys German nuclear-capable submarines.
[00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:07.991]  Iran test fires long-range missile missiles.
[00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.693]  Interesting other reports here on the police state front.
[00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:20.314]  It's all coming up after the first break that we're going to have here in just a few minutes.
[00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:28.875]  And again, you can talk about whatever subject you wish to discuss, but I think that it would really be a waste of time if we got into the Carr individual.
[00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:33.716]  Now the police saying he lied about killing JonBenet Ramsey.
[00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:37.897]  And right on time, they've now busted the...
[00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.410]  We're good to go.
[00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:08.920]  I think we should skip all of the distractions and the diversions and talk about World War III.
[00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:10.733]  We're good to go.
[00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:11.034]  I think?
[00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:35.506]  That doesn't matter.
[00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:48.731]  The establishment wants a war to usher in their one world government and distract populations domestically from the economy and the police state control grid that is being set up.
[00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:55.333]  So I want to talk to you, the listeners, predominantly about World War III and whether you think we're going to see it or not.
[00:03:55.373 --> 00:04:00.014]  Because if they go into Iran, that is a major regional war.
[00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:02.055]  Iran has already said they will...
[00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:04.694]  Block the Straits of Hormuz.
[00:04:05.254 --> 00:04:13.541]  They have already said that they will attack shipping and the shipping lanes surrounding their nation.
[00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:17.905]  And they're talking about, Mainstream News is talking about oil at $300 a barrel.
[00:04:17.985 --> 00:04:18.686]  Conservatively.
[00:04:22.057 --> 00:04:28.142]  Some are talking about even higher, some are talking about lower, but the average is $300 a barrel, what the analysts are predicting.
[00:04:29.022 --> 00:04:32.765]  If you think oil prices are high right now, it's $75 a barrel.
[00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:39.070]  Can you imagine what they would be at $300 and what that would do to our economy?
[00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:41.092]  Our economy is growing at about 3.5%.
[00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:48.898]  China is at over 10% as the trade deficit continues to widen.
[00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:51.964]  We'll plunge into all of the news and analysis.
[00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:56.367]  On the other side of this quick break, InfoWars.com's the website.
[00:04:56.707 --> 00:05:00.830]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:04.573 --> 00:05:07.735]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:10.057]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:18.023]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:25.777]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.177 --> 00:05:37.624]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:41.447]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:43.808]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.148 --> 00:05:47.991]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.115 --> 00:07:09.641]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:11.682]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:07:11.882 --> 00:07:13.023]  That's one in four adults.
[00:07:13.393 --> 00:07:14.394]  To learn more about heart care.
[00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:37.267]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents...
[00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:06.044]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.404 --> 00:08:08.565]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:39.139]  This is from Harash, one of the major papers in Israel.
[00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:48.731]  And the headline, Defense Chief Names Officer to Prepare for Possible War with Iran.
[00:08:51.189 --> 00:09:17.760]  In an effort to upgrade Israel's preparedness for a possible confrontation with Iran, Israel's Defense Force Chief of Staff, Dan Halutz, has appointed Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Shaqidi as the IDF's campaign manager against countries that do not border on Israel, primarily Iran.
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.001]  The appointment was made...
[00:09:19.987 --> 00:09:22.368]  Before the war in Lebanon.
[00:09:23.308 --> 00:09:33.291]  As part of his new responsibilities, Shaidi, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, will act as the GOC, Iran Command.
[00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:38.452]  He will oversee battle plans and manage the forces if war breaks out.
[00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:44.254]  According to a security source, Shaidi will be the, quote,
[00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:57.167]  Orchestra coordinator, that's their quote, coordinating the operational activity of Mossad and military intelligence with the IDF's various operational branches.
[00:09:57.868 --> 00:10:11.112]  The security sources noted that during the 1991 Gulf War, the IDF did not basically advertise their campaign manager for Iraq.
[00:10:11.692 --> 00:10:12.633]  Instead, the IDF
[00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:23.947]  AF, the intelligence agencies and the ground forces, each operated within their own areas of responsibility and authority.
[00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:32.789]  So they did not advertise the name of their campaign or how they were running it or what they were going to do or how they would respond.
[00:10:33.369 --> 00:10:51.760]  This is one of the first times since Israel's birth in the late 1940s that they have had an actual named war leader and have actually named an enemy that they're discussing going to war with or attacking.
[00:10:53.573 --> 00:10:56.116]  This is very, very serious.
[00:10:56.136 --> 00:11:10.031]  I was babbling a bit through that because for some reason the browser that gets used in this office, Firefox, Mozilla, cuts stuff off.
[00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:11.273]  That's why even though
[00:11:12.415 --> 00:11:17.137]  Internet Explorer is used by 85% of the population still, and lets viruses through.
[00:11:17.657 --> 00:11:23.439]  We should still use Internet Explorer, because when we print these articles, it chops them up.
[00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:25.980]  But, c'est la vie.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.880]  Why am I talking about that on the air?
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.341]  It's just becoming more and more annoying.
[00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:37.684]  Another report here, Israel rejects UN blockade appeal.
[00:11:38.384 --> 00:11:38.784]  Reuters...
[00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:56.645]  Israel rejected a call from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on Wednesday to lift its air and sea blockade of Lebanon, saying it would only end the seven-week-old siege once all elements of a ceasefire were in place.
[00:11:57.206 --> 00:12:04.972]  During an hour of talks with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Annan said he pressed for a lifting of the embargo...
[00:12:05.772 --> 00:12:14.898]  Imposed after the start of the war against Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrilla group on July 12th, mainly on economic grounds.
[00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:30.487]  At a news conference after the meeting, Olmert rebuffed Annan, saying any relaxation of pressure on Lebanon's ports and airspace depended on the full implementation of UN Resolution 1701, which governs the ceasefire with Hezbollah.
[00:12:30.787 --> 00:12:32.668]  The resolution is a fixed resolution.
[00:12:32.928 --> 00:12:34.068]  We're good to go.
[00:12:34.088 --> 00:12:34.769]  We're good to go.
[00:12:54.699 --> 00:13:03.224]  The establishment does not like it when a country becomes sovereign and democratic and starts having more terrorism than Israel in many of its cities.
[00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:18.654]  And so good old Hezbollah, as usual, stirring things up gives Israel the excuse to come in and level large sections of the major cities, including their capital city of Beirut.
[00:13:20.063 --> 00:13:23.465]  Russia has rejected sanctions against Iran.
[00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:28.468]  Russia on Friday rejected any talk for now of sanctions against Iran.
[00:13:28.528 --> 00:13:39.695]  And France warned against conflict with Tehran, raising doubt whether it will face swift penalties for not halting nuclear work by an August 31st deadline.
[00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:40.796]  That is tomorrow.
[00:13:41.756 --> 00:13:48.060]  Responding to an offer of economic incentives to stop enriching uranium, Iran hinted that
[00:13:49.338 --> 00:14:00.702]  Six world powers on Tuesday, it could curb its program as a result of talks to implement the package, but not as a precondition as they demanded.
[00:14:01.802 --> 00:14:09.265]  The reply seemed designed to crack the ramshackle United Front of four...
[00:14:10.365 --> 00:14:15.469]  Western powers and Russia and China behind the UN Security Council deadline.
[00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:19.752]  The West sees Iran's nuclear work as a looming threat to peace.
[00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:21.713]  Russia and China do not.
[00:14:23.714 --> 00:14:34.522]  And the average Westerner, the average American, we've talked a lot about this, does not know the history of Iran.
[00:14:34.642 --> 00:14:35.823]  They do not even know that
[00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:56.237]  Three years ago, Iran agreed to total inspections, total occupation by United Nations investigators, all of their major industries being thoroughly surveilled with live cameras and live personnel, and the U.N.
[00:14:56.337 --> 00:14:57.178]  hailed them.
[00:14:57.258 --> 00:14:57.878]  The U.S.
[00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:03.080]  had to hail their previous leader, who was seen as a moderate leader,
[00:15:04.648 --> 00:15:26.614]  And who was openly supporting the existence of Israel, openly being friendly towards the West, and the West then told him, their last leader, well if you'll just totally stop even your peaceful nuclear program for a few months, we'll make a deal with you and let you have a peaceful program.
[00:15:27.262 --> 00:15:37.912]  And they said, okay, we'll go ahead and voluntarily cease even our peaceful program that even in treaties is completely authorized in agreements.
[00:15:39.574 --> 00:15:44.359]  And then a year went by and the West said, no, you're not allowed to now.
[00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:45.900]  You made an agreement.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.442]  You're making nuclear weapons.
[00:15:48.875 --> 00:16:08.418]  And Iran went, wait a minute, you've got your inspectors everywhere, you know this is peaceful, you said that if we just waited a few months you'd give us an agreement, you lied to us, and so that caused their previous, more moderate leader to be ejected, and for Ahmed Dinejad, a more hard-line character, to be put into power.
[00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:12.242]  Now, the average American doesn't even know Ahmadinejad's name.
[00:16:12.282 --> 00:16:15.983]  They don't even know where Iran is in major national studies and polls.
[00:16:16.683 --> 00:16:18.204]  They can't even find it on a map.
[00:16:18.664 --> 00:16:21.705]  They just know it's some Arab over there we got to kill.
[00:16:21.745 --> 00:16:30.748]  Of course, they're not Arabs or Arabs or whatever new name they're given by the illiterate population of dumbed-down serfs in this country.
[00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:33.429]  But, I mean, imagine being Iran.
[00:16:33.449 --> 00:16:35.710]  Imagine.
[00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:36.350]  Imagine.
[00:16:37.433 --> 00:17:02.163]  Having the British come in at the turn of the 19th century going into the 20th century and maintaining control and grabbing control of your entire oil supply through British Petroleum and then there is an elected leader that comes to power in 1950, Mohammad Mosaddegh.
[00:17:03.443 --> 00:17:05.904]  He drives the Communists out of the north of his country
[00:17:06.644 --> 00:17:10.868]  He is educated in the West, pro-United States.
[00:17:10.908 --> 00:17:11.869]  This is all on record.
[00:17:12.249 --> 00:17:14.491]  Time magazine man of the year.
[00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:23.459]  And he just simply told British Petroleum, listen, you're going to have to give us 25 to 30 percent of the oil revenue.
[00:17:24.139 --> 00:17:32.627]  Previously, they were paying the oil field workers slave wages, and that is the only money that Iran got to keep of their own oil.
[00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:35.990]  And when BP said, we're not going to even debate you.
[00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.832]  We're not even going to come to the negotiation table with you.
[00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:44.857]  We own all of your oil because they previously had controlled it through a semi-colonial system.
[00:17:45.658 --> 00:17:47.299]  And Mohamed Mosaddegh said, you know what?
[00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:48.540]  My people deserve schools.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.201]  My people deserve support.
[00:17:50.642 --> 00:17:52.903]  And he said, I'm nationalizing the fields.
[00:17:53.724 --> 00:17:55.405]  We will still pay you a percentage of it.
[00:17:56.146 --> 00:17:59.789]  And so MI6 approached Kermit Roosevelt, the CIA.
[00:18:00.249 --> 00:18:02.591]  I talk a lot about this because this is what started everything.
[00:18:03.527 --> 00:18:07.548]  This is what started so many tracks in modern history in our society.
[00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:13.870]  And Kermit Roosevelt went in there with a small, less than 12-man team.
[00:18:15.051 --> 00:18:18.552]  They went in there with millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars.
[00:18:19.092 --> 00:18:20.992]  They brag all about it in after-action reports.
[00:18:22.013 --> 00:18:26.114]  And for a couple months, they hired every criminal group, every radical Muslim group.
[00:18:26.966 --> 00:18:27.146]  I think.
[00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:27.326]  I think.
[00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:45.962]  We're good to go.
[00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:07.619]  And the Iranians all know about this.
[00:19:07.699 --> 00:19:09.220]  See, they know where the U.S.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:16.524]  is on a map, and they know where England is on a map, and they know about Mohammad Mosaddegh, and they know about stage terror, and they understand what happened.
[00:19:16.544 --> 00:19:23.928]  And then our government put in the Shah, and over 200,000 people were abducted and tortured to death.
[00:19:25.068 --> 00:19:26.249]  This is publicly admitted.
[00:19:26.269 --> 00:19:26.569]  200,000 people.
[00:19:30.012 --> 00:19:30.973]  From 1953 until 1979, disappeared.
[00:19:36.992 --> 00:19:39.314]  And people got real angry.
[00:19:39.974 --> 00:19:57.507]  But still they lick our boots and let the UN run everything and make agreements, and the UN breaks them, and then they put a radical in who says, if you want to roll, let's roll, and the neocons go, good, just like we wanted, let's have World War III, and now our sons and daughters can die over there in what's coming up.
[00:19:58.168 --> 00:19:59.529]  Isn't that just precious?

[00:20:54.361 --> 00:21:07.311]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.492 --> 00:21:13.316]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.516 --> 00:21:16.258]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.298 --> 00:21:17.419]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.344]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:31.532]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.513 --> 00:21:35.595]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:41.179]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.460]  Call for your copy today.

[00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.890]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:54.151]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.545 --> 00:22:05.006]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.486 --> 00:22:12.790]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:22.734]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[00:22:23.454 --> 00:22:29.637]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[00:22:30.377 --> 00:22:38.481]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.183 --> 00:23:03.487]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:06.130]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:12.016]  Are you frustrated, burned out and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:25.286]  Well, I won't back down No, I won't back down You can stand me up at the gates of hell But I won't back down
[00:24:26.738 --> 00:24:54.933]  Gonna stand my ground Won't be turned around And I'll keep this world from dragging me down Gonna stand my ground And I won't back down Hey baby There ain't no easy way out
[00:24:56.949 --> 00:24:59.191]  Welcome back.
[00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:00.832]  We're going to your calls right now.
[00:25:00.992 --> 00:25:07.257]  I just had a chance to see a new online video of an incident that happened just a few days ago.
[00:25:07.317 --> 00:25:13.362]  Again, this is happening every couple days in Arizona, in Texas, but predominantly in Los Angeles.
[00:25:13.382 --> 00:25:24.630]  You see the mainstream news articles where hordes of illegal alien Mexicans and their supporters and other foreigners go to even government buildings and
[00:25:25.362 --> 00:25:26.283]  We're good to go.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.761]  But I've never seen video of it.
[00:25:45.101 --> 00:25:46.842]  We now have video in L.A.
[00:25:46.922 --> 00:25:55.505]  where the majority illegal alien city is chomping at the bit so bad to bring this country down, brought in by our government, to create the American Union.
[00:25:55.545 --> 00:25:56.465]  It's happening right now.
[00:25:57.266 --> 00:26:12.712]  They go in, they pull down the American flag, they hoist the Mexican flag, and the police, who normally will arrest American citizens, this has happened in Arizona, who go and hoist the American flag back up
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:13.820]  Hi, Alex.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.641]  I have a sister-in-law in L.A.
[00:26:43.587 --> 00:26:43.807]  Yes.
[00:26:43.907 --> 00:26:45.128]  And I'm really worried about her.
[00:26:45.308 --> 00:26:48.851]  As far as that goes, I think they're going to be stormed and looted.
[00:26:50.533 --> 00:26:53.395]  As far as World War III, yes, it's coming.
[00:26:53.455 --> 00:26:57.238]  I have two boys, 27 and 25, and I know they're going.
[00:26:57.258 --> 00:27:07.847]  I see it coming, and they're going to remove all of our healthy children and men from 18 to 42 out of this country.
[00:27:07.887 --> 00:27:09.308]  That's how you destroy a country.
[00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.350]  And then the people that are left here,
[00:27:11.934 --> 00:27:16.836]  Children, the old women, the old people, they're coming after us with a vengeance.
[00:27:17.537 --> 00:27:20.318]  There are some very evil people that are controlling all this.
[00:27:20.838 --> 00:27:21.879]  I read, read, read.
[00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:25.200]  I listen to you, and this is scary.
[00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:28.102]  What do we do about it?
[00:27:28.122 --> 00:27:28.962]  What are solutions?
[00:27:30.243 --> 00:27:32.864]  I'm trying to wake everybody up right now as I speak.
[00:27:32.944 --> 00:27:37.506]  I am burning DVDs, but I'm just getting crucified in this town.
[00:27:37.546 --> 00:27:38.867]  People are hating on me.
[00:27:39.574 --> 00:27:40.955]  Calling me unpatriotic.
[00:27:41.015 --> 00:27:41.955]  I ought to be shot.
[00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:45.117]  They're ready to call the local mental hospital.
[00:27:45.677 --> 00:27:48.258]  I mean, this is the reaction that I'm getting.
[00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:51.020]  Where are you going?
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.361]  What individuals?
[00:27:52.501 --> 00:28:00.485]  I mean, give us the average type of person that's saying you need to be shot because that's a threat whenever someone threatens you.
[00:28:00.785 --> 00:28:04.707]  Well, I did go to the police with that because I had him on video, but they said that,
[00:28:05.051 --> 00:28:07.533]  Because he didn't say, I'm going to shoot you.
[00:28:07.794 --> 00:28:10.236]  It's okay to say you ought to be shot.
[00:28:10.516 --> 00:28:11.677]  Where were you when this happened?
[00:28:12.137 --> 00:28:19.224]  I was, actually, he left a message on my cell phone because I've been putting little messages in a local newspaper here trying to warn people of things.
[00:28:19.624 --> 00:28:23.628]  And I've been told that some of the things that I'm putting in, I have to put my phone number, so I do.
[00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:26.780]  And one person called me, and I know who he is.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.740]  He lives right up the road.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.741]  Well, the paper can't make you put your phone number in there.
[00:28:31.161 --> 00:28:32.021]  That's ridiculous.
[00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:45.045]  Well, they have told me to because some of the things that I... Well, this is how tyranny works, is people who aren't even in the government try to enforce the system on the people, and you need some support.
[00:28:45.105 --> 00:28:46.265]  Where are you in Rhode Island?
[00:28:46.685 --> 00:28:49.186]  I'm as far northwest as you can get.
[00:28:50.097 --> 00:28:53.919]  As a matter of fact, I'm right up against Douglas State Forest in Massachusetts.
[00:28:53.939 --> 00:28:54.919]  What town are you in?
[00:28:55.119 --> 00:28:56.080]  Coralville.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:09.145]  Well, since your number is already in the paper, would you like to give us your name and your phone number so people in Rhode Island, we have a big listenership there, can call you and support you?
[00:29:09.185 --> 00:29:10.005]  Absolutely.
[00:29:10.566 --> 00:29:12.146]  Okay, give people your number.
[00:29:12.827 --> 00:29:15.007]  My name is Linda, and my number is 401-323-2988.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.561]  And I could sure use some support.
[00:29:21.721 --> 00:29:22.041]  Sure.
[00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:23.822]  No, we need to get everybody together.
[00:29:23.842 --> 00:29:27.343]  You know, it's sad that it has to be our women out there fighting for this country.
[00:29:27.383 --> 00:29:31.624]  You know, I would have been 16, but I wish you were one of my boys.
[00:29:33.045 --> 00:29:34.586]  Give us your number again for those that missed it.
[00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:34.646]  401-323-2988.
[00:29:39.395 --> 00:29:47.804]  All right, I hope people there in Rhode Island will come to your assistance, and then you can go out together and give out the DVDs and put the information in the paper.
[00:29:47.864 --> 00:29:48.605]  You keep it up.
[00:29:48.905 --> 00:29:49.626]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.029 --> 00:29:52.910]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.012]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.933 --> 00:29:58.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.085 --> 00:30:04.586]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:04.687 --> 00:30:07.068]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:30:07.128 --> 00:30:13.312]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:17.094]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:21.276]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:30:21.836 --> 00:30:25.959]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:30:26.539 --> 00:30:29.481]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:30:30.484 --> 00:30:33.425]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:40.126]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:40.386 --> 00:30:43.227]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:43.727 --> 00:30:48.048]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[00:30:48.128 --> 00:30:51.029]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[00:30:52.009 --> 00:30:54.290]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:58.551]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[00:30:58.891 --> 00:30:59.851]  And ask for George.
[00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:03.549]  The war on terrorism.
[00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.671]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:11.092]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:31:11.513 --> 00:31:12.353]  So what do you do?
[00:31:12.673 --> 00:31:17.235]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:19.852]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:31:20.332 --> 00:31:35.038]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:31:35.078 --> 00:31:42.200]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:31:47.162 --> 00:31:47.563]  That's 888-803-4438
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.903]  Dry, cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:32:06.143 --> 00:32:08.764]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:32:09.184 --> 00:32:11.745]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[00:32:12.106 --> 00:32:17.088]  It's diabetic-friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:32:17.308 --> 00:32:20.850]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:22.731]  Now they look and feel great.
[00:32:23.071 --> 00:32:26.552]  If you have calluses or dry, cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[00:32:26.873 --> 00:32:29.774]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:32:31.226 --> 00:32:33.707]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:32:34.168 --> 00:32:36.089]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:39.971]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:32:40.611 --> 00:32:47.094]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:50.076]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:32:50.456 --> 00:32:50.896]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:50.976 --> 00:32:52.357]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:33:02.888 --> 00:33:05.770]  We're good to go.
[00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:09.473]  We're good to go.
[00:33:31.792 --> 00:33:35.639]  Criticizing the government is not patriotic.
[00:33:36.383 --> 00:33:36.783]  We're good to go.
[00:33:36.803 --> 00:33:36.963]  I think?
[00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:06.641]  We're good to go.
[00:34:34.153 --> 00:34:34.815]  We're good to go.
[00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:49.033]  The only good American is a stupid cheeseburger-eating, television-watching person who has no idea what's even going on.
[00:34:49.473 --> 00:35:04.859]  You're supposed to affix a plastic flag made in China by sweatshop laborers or slaves to your car and just mindlessly feel good and then send threatening emails or letters or phone calls to women who are out trying to warn the public.
[00:35:06.299 --> 00:35:08.020]  That's what this country has turned into.
[00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:31.409]  And for all those people that defend this system, for all the people that think they're part of the system and think that everything's okay, all of the basic tenets and canons and pillars of our society and our supposedly free civilization are being destroyed, are being decimated, are being removed, are being laid waste right now.
[00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.692]  Our future is extremely dire.
[00:35:37.341 --> 00:35:38.724]  Let's talk to Dave in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:38.764 --> 00:35:39.565]  Dave, you're on the air.
[00:35:39.585 --> 00:35:39.906]  Welcome.
[00:35:40.246 --> 00:35:40.928]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[00:35:40.968 --> 00:35:42.771]  I've been making a lot of copies of your films.
[00:35:42.851 --> 00:35:44.434]  I've been passing them around to a lot of people.
[00:35:44.514 --> 00:35:47.660]  Plus, I've got one of your shirts, and I get a lot of strange looks from people.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.203]  It's the Mass Murderers t-shirt.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.801]  And there's a few points I was going to bring up.
[00:35:52.061 --> 00:36:01.427]  Did you happen to catch the advertisement on ABC about this new movie that they're going to be presenting on September the 10th called The Path to 9-11 based upon the 9-11 Commission's report?
[00:36:01.487 --> 00:36:03.868]  I call it The False Path to 9-11 myself.
[00:36:04.108 --> 00:36:17.516]  Yeah, there's a major propaganda putsch going on everywhere to reaffirm the official story, and I have read about it and read the synopsis of that program and others that are going to be airing in the next week and a half.
[00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:23.163]  And also, last night on Coast to Coast, George Norrie had an interesting gentleman on there, a young guy, 20 years old.
[00:36:23.203 --> 00:36:24.383]  His name is Sean Morrow.
[00:36:24.763 --> 00:36:31.885]  He has a website, worldthreats.com, and he takes the position like, oh, the government is innocent in any of this stuff that's happened.
[00:36:32.505 --> 00:36:40.508]  He takes a very opposite approach as far as the way how he analyzes and looks at things, and I think he'd be a very interesting guest for your show sometime in the future.
[00:36:42.137 --> 00:36:44.599]  Yeah, but it sounds like a fairy tale.
[00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:46.701]  Why would I want to interview somebody putting on a fairy tale?
[00:36:46.861 --> 00:37:01.592]  But the thing I couldn't understand was the way how George was just going along with this guy, where normally George would take a different stand when it comes to some of these things that this guy was doling out, keeping the Bin Laden myth alive, saying, oh, he's still alive, where we all know that
[00:37:01.972 --> 00:37:05.153]  He's apparently out of this picture altogether.
[00:37:05.373 --> 00:37:08.475]  Well, I mean, the government doesn't have him on the wanted list.
[00:37:08.495 --> 00:37:09.535]  He hasn't been indicted.
[00:37:09.555 --> 00:37:13.517]  The CIA number three man says they don't want to catch him.
[00:37:14.037 --> 00:37:17.998]  But I guess, according to this guy, he's going to get us any minute unless we give all our freedoms up.
[00:37:18.419 --> 00:37:26.862]  And this gentleman also apparently hasn't read the PNAC documents, nor Operation Northwoods, nor the Grand Chess Board by Zygmunt Brzezinski in as far as
[00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:32.160]  What these evil people are really up to doing without most of us out here knowing what's actually really going on.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:33.880]  Keep up the great work.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.181]  You're a godsend, Alex.
[00:37:53.052 --> 00:37:54.093]  We'll see if that happens.
[00:37:54.133 --> 00:38:03.101]  I need to get on there and really with this anniversary of 9-11 coming up, put out the truth on that very important national broadcast.
[00:38:03.742 --> 00:38:06.344]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in New York.
[00:38:06.424 --> 00:38:07.265]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:38:07.605 --> 00:38:08.366]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:38:08.666 --> 00:38:08.946]  Hi.
[00:38:09.767 --> 00:38:16.153]  Your monologue, you're talking about the Mideast and the Near East and the warmongers in the Bush administration.
[00:38:16.173 --> 00:38:18.455]  They want us to fight over there eventually and
[00:38:19.389 --> 00:38:35.352]  I just read an article in today's Daily News where Rumsfeld again is making the comparison that anyone who is against the Iraq occupation and our continued presence over there and all the other plans that they're building up to is just like appeasing Hitler.
[00:38:35.512 --> 00:38:37.192]  They keep on using the Hitler analogy.
[00:38:38.192 --> 00:38:46.754]  And the real war is right here on our soil with the illegal immigration issue and the North American Union and all this stuff.
[00:38:47.506 --> 00:38:59.133]  And listening to your interview with Buchanan a couple of days ago, you said one of the things that we can do, like that woman you spoke to in Rhode Island the first call, is to take action, whatever action we can take.
[00:38:59.793 --> 00:39:14.121]  So the elections are coming up in November, and I made a quick list here of the Senators who voted for the Treason Bill, which I like to call it Senate Bill 2611, to grant amnesty to the illegal aliens.
[00:39:15.222 --> 00:39:16.383]  Four of the Republicans...
[00:39:17.136 --> 00:39:22.620]  That voted for Senate Bill 2611 are up for re-election in November.
[00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:30.707]  Richard Lugar from Indiana, Michael DeWine from Ohio, Olympia Snowe from Maine, and Lincoln Chafee from Rhode Island.
[00:39:31.867 --> 00:39:45.158]  So like Buchanan said in your interview with him, that regardless of how good anybody is on any issue, although none of the ones I see listed here are that good anyway, but don't even think about voting for any one of those Republicans.
[00:39:46.587 --> 00:39:47.088]  That's right.
[00:39:47.108 --> 00:39:52.811]  If you're going to be free, it isn't going to be free, and that means you're going to have to learn how these traitors are voting.
[00:39:53.711 --> 00:39:54.252]  Absolutely.
[00:39:54.992 --> 00:39:57.934]  And here are the ten Democrats that voted for 26-11.
[00:39:58.314 --> 00:40:08.540]  Akaka from Hawaii, Bingaman from New Mexico, Cantwell from Washington, Harper from Delaware, Clinton from New York, Conrad from North Dakota.
[00:40:09.181 --> 00:40:16.205]  Feinstein from California, Kennedy from Massachusetts, Cole from Wisconsin, and Lieberman from Connecticut, who's already been somewhat defeated.
[00:40:17.546 --> 00:40:23.090]  And three Democrats that voted against 26-11 are up for re-election.
[00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:28.553]  Nelson from Nebraska, Byrd from West Virginia, and Stabenow from Michigan.
[00:40:29.534 --> 00:40:31.015]  So, you know, it's interesting.
[00:40:31.515 --> 00:40:36.418]  The woman from Rhode Island called, and Lincoln Chafee is one of the senators up for re-election.
[00:40:36.558 --> 00:40:37.499]  He's being challenged.
[00:40:38.382 --> 00:40:39.942]  In a primary by a conservative.
[00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:46.164]  And the National Republican Senatorial Committee has already come down on the side of Lincoln Chafee.
[00:40:47.525 --> 00:40:51.146]  Well, they've always, I mean, they've come out against Tom Tancredo.
[00:40:51.166 --> 00:40:52.786]  They've tried to get Ron Paul defeated.
[00:40:52.806 --> 00:41:02.189]  And it's because the conservative constituents are dumb as dirt and they don't understand that Bush is a Republican in name only, known as a rhino.
[00:41:02.229 --> 00:41:03.049]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:03.129 --> 00:41:03.710]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:04.090]  You bet.
[00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:05.090]  Good to hear from you, Ken.
[00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:08.941]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charles in California.
[00:41:08.981 --> 00:41:09.361]  Welcome.
[00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:10.241]  Hi, yes.
[00:41:10.782 --> 00:41:20.387]  First, I'd like to make two statements in support of the movement, and then I have one issue I'd like to plead over with you, and then I'd like to make a comment on Stone Bones.
[00:41:20.587 --> 00:41:23.609]  But first, I'd like to say Linda is a patriotic...
[00:41:24.088 --> 00:41:24.608]  American.
[00:41:24.628 --> 00:41:27.970]  She is a proud and strong woman, and we should all salute her.
[00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:33.773]  For those that just joined us, she's been in Rhode Island the last few months, giving out DVDs, writing letters to the editors.
[00:41:33.813 --> 00:41:38.975]  She's got people calling her up, threatening that she should be shot at her home, and the police won't help her.
[00:41:39.515 --> 00:41:39.675]  Yeah.
[00:41:39.695 --> 00:41:43.897]  Because they want to let the brown shirts have their way, because this is how the intimidation works.
[00:41:44.758 --> 00:41:46.438]  Okay, the first statement.
[00:41:46.518 --> 00:41:52.181]  People can use the Windows program DVD shrink to fit DVD nines onto single-layer DVD recordables.
[00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:54.881]  It is freeware and available with an online search.
[00:41:55.381 --> 00:42:02.686]  Also, I suggest using DVD-R as opposed to DVD-R as it has compatibility issues with older players.
[00:42:02.906 --> 00:42:05.768]  This can be used, for example, on Terror Storm.
[00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:16.476]  Secondly, I urge all members of the Truth Movement to actively visit Google Video and YouTube so that we can collectively, as a whole, rank up pertinent materials
[00:42:17.065 --> 00:42:21.426]  Well, ranking down materials that do not... Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:42:22.527 --> 00:42:27.468]  Somebody running around drunk, falling into a mop bucket, shouldn't have 20 million viewers.
[00:42:27.848 --> 00:42:29.489]  Things like Terror Storm should.
[00:42:29.509 --> 00:42:41.533]  And when you visit these videos online, it drives them up to the top of the list where the hundreds of millions, and it was hundreds of millions of people, have now gone to YouTube and even more going to Google Video.
[00:42:41.553 --> 00:42:42.613]  We need to drive it up to the top.
[00:42:42.873 --> 00:42:46.194]  That's correct, because it gets awareness as a whole up for everyone.
[00:42:46.710 --> 00:43:08.020]  Then the issue I'd like to plead with you about is perhaps re-encoding the prisonplanet.tv files to a higher codec, a higher quality codec, such as DivX or Xvid, as this makes it easier for first-time viewers to see visual artifacts like the squibs on the WTC buildings.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.441]  What is that, DivX and what?
[00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:14.583]  DivX and Xvid, they use more CPU time to get a...
[00:43:19.258 --> 00:43:19.918]  Sure.
[00:43:19.958 --> 00:43:21.559]  We can always use everybody's tips.
[00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:26.861]  Just send those to Ryan at InfoWars.com or Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:26.881 --> 00:43:27.901]  I've got to move on.
[00:43:27.941 --> 00:43:29.922]  Thank you, sir, for the call.
[00:43:29.942 --> 00:43:31.583]  Some good strategies, some good ideas.
[00:43:33.095 --> 00:43:39.337]  The web is now media-wise bigger than the mainstream media, but it's fractured into a million-plus pieces.
[00:43:39.897 --> 00:43:48.160]  But Patriot truth-telling information is now one of the biggest sectors in that arena, and we are rising quickly.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:55.502]  So all of you out there that are emailing your friends and family, that are going on to message boards, that are going on to MySpace,
[00:43:56.022 --> 00:43:56.843]  Continue it.
[00:43:56.903 --> 00:43:59.505]  Continue lobbying for liberty and freedom.
[00:43:59.565 --> 00:44:04.269]  Every mind we free is one step closer to defeating the global crime syndicate.
[00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.591]  Let's talk to Anthony in Arizona.
[00:44:06.691 --> 00:44:07.692]  Anthony, you're on the air.
[00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:08.773]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:44:08.993 --> 00:44:13.557]  I wanted to know what you think Bush's role in the New World Order really is.
[00:44:13.997 --> 00:44:17.380]  Is he just a blackmailed puppet, or is he higher up?
[00:44:18.786 --> 00:44:19.126]  We're good to go.
[00:44:19.146 --> 00:44:19.286]  I think?
[00:44:36.298 --> 00:44:36.939]  Oh, I see.
[00:44:37.219 --> 00:44:41.002]  And I wanted to thank you for waking me up and stuff.
[00:45:01.474 --> 00:45:02.194]  That's about it.
[00:45:02.975 --> 00:45:03.795]  Well, I appreciate it.
[00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:05.597]  Let me just recap a top story.
[00:45:05.677 --> 00:45:15.283]  One of the largest Israeli papers, second largest, Haratz, is reporting off official press releases that the Israeli military has appointed a war chief.
[00:45:15.643 --> 00:45:18.284]  Okay, Nathan, where are you calling us from today?
[00:45:18.384 --> 00:45:19.004]  Kentucky Welcome, sir.
[00:45:45.202 --> 00:45:45.562]  Thank you.
[00:45:45.902 --> 00:45:47.063]  Alex had two questions.
[00:45:47.263 --> 00:45:48.823]  One about the National ID card.
[00:45:49.363 --> 00:45:52.304]  Is this thing something that's already unstoppable?
[00:45:52.544 --> 00:45:54.805]  And if it is, what should people do about it?
[00:45:56.145 --> 00:45:58.806]  Number one, nothing is ever unstoppable.
[00:45:59.366 --> 00:46:03.107]  Number two, it is being implemented right now.
[00:46:03.167 --> 00:46:09.169]  Would you like to stay on hold, or would you like me to let you go and give you your answer, or do you have any other questions?
[00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.070]  One other question is...
[00:46:12.808 --> 00:46:26.055]  I watched Terror Storm recently with a friend of mine, and he was very skeptical about the whole New World Order theory, and he just doesn't, like a lot of people, think that he doesn't understand how such a big thing can be hidden.
[00:46:26.175 --> 00:46:28.357]  Well, it's not a theory.
[00:46:28.417 --> 00:46:31.378]  Well, I mean, again, well, finish your question.
[00:46:31.398 --> 00:46:31.658]  Sorry.
[00:46:32.199 --> 00:46:40.343]  I'm sorry, but like a lot of people, he just can't accept that something so big can be going on and not be widely known, even though it is widely known.
[00:46:41.605 --> 00:46:45.946]  How can you further approach those people to help them wake up?
[00:46:47.246 --> 00:46:48.327]  Sure, I appreciate your call.
[00:46:48.347 --> 00:46:50.527]  Let me answer the second question first.
[00:46:51.207 --> 00:46:53.488]  It's a really central question.
[00:46:54.468 --> 00:46:58.889]  It's seminal that when you're talking to somebody that you explain to them.
[00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:05.170]  First, you're not trying to make them feel like they're dumb, but you need to ask them basic geography questions.
[00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:08.731]  You need to ask them, how many continents are there?
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:10.360]  Okay.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:10.460]  Okay.
[00:47:36.897 --> 00:47:50.947]  You know, they'll spend maybe 20 minutes on the continents in one lesson in seventh grade, and then they'll spend hundreds of hours on how we all have to be guilty and how America's bad and how, you know, all this multicultural stuff.
[00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:53.969]  They don't teach them basic facts anymore.
[00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.991]  People say education is broken.
[00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:57.772]  It's not broken.
[00:47:58.582 --> 00:47:59.362]  We're good to go.
[00:47:59.382 --> 00:47:59.582]  I think?
[00:48:25.723 --> 00:48:26.843]  All the sciences are.
[00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:29.004]  This is incredible stuff.
[00:48:29.564 --> 00:48:35.726]  I mean, if I wasn't fighting the New World Order, that's all I'd be doing was studying science and information and history.
[00:48:35.986 --> 00:48:36.647]  It's amazing.
[00:48:36.687 --> 00:48:38.247]  It's better than any fiction.
[00:48:38.907 --> 00:48:39.868]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:48:40.168 --> 00:48:43.149]  Let me attempt to answer the questions in the two minutes we've got left in this segment.
[00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:49.451]  First off, they say, how would you keep something like this secret?
[00:48:50.478 --> 00:48:50.858]  We're good to go.
[00:48:50.878 --> 00:48:51.118]  I think?
[00:49:07.196 --> 00:49:26.468]  Okay, well, just as you don't know where Iraq is on a map, or how many continents there are, or who the second president was, or what the third amendment, or the fifth amendment, or the ninth amendment, or the tenth amendment, much less the first amendment is, you just don't know about the real world because it was never presented to you on television, or you were never taught it.
[00:49:27.328 --> 00:49:30.570]  You were taught all about the Hollywood stars and what they like to eat for dinner.
[00:49:30.831 --> 00:49:33.452]  You know all about that, or what kind of cars they drive.
[00:49:33.512 --> 00:49:36.254]  You just have been diverted and distracted.
[00:49:37.438 --> 00:49:42.024]  So if someone doesn't believe there's a world elite, it's because they don't know basic history.
[00:49:42.064 --> 00:49:50.073]  They don't know there's always elites scheming and engaging in conspiracies to dominate and consolidate and expand their control.
[00:49:51.622 --> 00:50:10.615]  Then you can go online and pull out David Rockefeller's own quotes where he says we're creating a one world government, we're going to take your freedoms, and then if they don't believe the printout, you can say come with me and you march them into a major library and you pull up David Rockefeller's autobiography written three years ago and you open it to the page and you go read it!
[00:50:11.315 --> 00:50:14.037]  And they go okay, maybe that's true, but other stuff isn't.
[00:50:14.777 --> 00:50:16.919]  And then you just start walking them through it.
[00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:22.911]  And if they don't want to spend the time with you to find out it's true, then you move on.
[00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:24.732]  Let the dead bury the dead.
[00:50:25.152 --> 00:50:27.092]  Dust off your feet.
[00:50:27.572 --> 00:50:33.014]  You know, just as Christ said, do not waste your time throwing pearls.
[00:50:33.694 --> 00:50:34.834]  That's what the information is.
[00:50:34.854 --> 00:50:37.255]  It's more valuable than diamonds and pearls and rubies.
[00:50:37.855 --> 00:50:43.176]  Do not throw precious jewels in front of pig people.
[00:50:44.042 --> 00:50:44.463]  Okay?
[00:50:45.023 --> 00:50:47.266]  Do not waste your time.
[00:50:47.547 --> 00:50:50.190]  You're lovingly trying to warn them.
[00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:54.416]  If they don't want it, move on to people that want help.
[00:50:55.577 --> 00:50:59.843]  So, I'll try to answer this other question when we get back.
[00:51:04.813 --> 00:51:07.994]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.334 --> 00:51:10.254]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.654 --> 00:51:18.316]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.996 --> 00:51:26.037]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.438 --> 00:51:29.378]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.758 --> 00:51:32.059]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.499 --> 00:51:33.319]  NSA spies.
[00:51:34.526 --> 00:51:37.848]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:51:38.168 --> 00:51:41.669]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.129 --> 00:51:44.030]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:48.291]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.868 --> 00:52:05.451]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.491 --> 00:52:05.992]  are located?
[00:52:06.192 --> 00:52:09.575]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:54:06.169 --> 00:54:13.115]  George Humphries will be in the studio with us coming up in the next segment.
[00:54:13.175 --> 00:54:21.703]  And, of course, we'll take that video interview and put it up on prisonplanet.tv for all the members and put it on local Austin television as we try to attack the New World Order from different angles.
[00:54:22.163 --> 00:54:28.269]  I want to finish up with the first question that that gentleman was talking about, the national ID card.
[00:54:28.329 --> 00:54:29.130]  Is it a done deal?
[00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:30.371]  Can we stop it?
[00:54:30.411 --> 00:54:31.752]  This is how the globalists do everything.
[00:54:31.792 --> 00:54:32.653]  They camouflage it.
[00:54:33.763 --> 00:54:36.165]  In the legislation, it states it's a national ID card.
[00:54:36.966 --> 00:54:39.488]  It says there'll be internal checkpoints where they're going to check these.
[00:54:39.908 --> 00:54:41.569]  Life will be like it is in the airports.
[00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:45.252]  I've got Governor Ridge on tape, back when he was Homeland Security Director, saying that.
[00:54:45.573 --> 00:54:48.415]  It's called the Real ID Act, and it was passed over a year ago.
[00:54:49.028 --> 00:54:54.632]  It was passed in early 2005, and by 2008, by law, it must be implemented in all 50 states.
[00:54:54.712 --> 00:54:56.954]  Now, most states had already implemented it.
[00:54:57.314 --> 00:55:02.999]  Texas was national ID card compliant in 1993 under national ID card executive orders.
[00:55:03.019 --> 00:55:06.782]  But they always like to codify it then, congressionally, if they can.
[00:55:07.422 --> 00:55:08.464]  We're good to go.
[00:55:08.604 --> 00:55:09.004]  I think?
[00:55:25.886 --> 00:55:27.486]  It's not just a national ID card.
[00:55:27.526 --> 00:55:29.527]  It's a North American ID card.
[00:55:29.547 --> 00:55:39.830]  It will also serve to be swiped whenever you make a purchase because we're now going to have a national sales tax that's going to be graduated depending on how much money you make.
[00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:45.631]  And their claim is, they're already saying this officially in strategy papers the feds have put out, that they've got to stop.
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:58.090]  Wealthy people, the people that are in the 15, 20, 25% sales bracket, from going and getting, quote, poor people to go make purchases for them who will be in the zero sales tax percentage bracket.
[00:55:58.310 --> 00:55:59.991]  So, hence, you must swipe your card.
[00:56:00.332 --> 00:56:05.016]  Then they must check how much you're buying according to your income to make sure this isn't going on.
[00:56:05.336 --> 00:56:12.342]  This is Neil Bortz and other people's, quote, solution to the income tax, which they're going to keep and rename as the Social Security tax.
[00:56:12.722 --> 00:56:13.222]  We're good to go.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:45.609]  When I saw in official industry plans that AT&T and others, all the major phone companies, had gotten $9 billion.
[00:56:47.273 --> 00:56:56.195]  That by October 1st, 2001, it was a law that was passed, but the government gave $9 billion to implement putting in NSA hubs into all telecommunications.
[00:56:56.555 --> 00:57:05.137]  And then you finally heard about it earlier this year with, quote, AT&T has whole floors and all their major offices that are NSA run.
[00:57:05.357 --> 00:57:07.077]  That was because one employee blew the whistle.
[00:57:07.338 --> 00:57:11.298]  Then they declared national security and told the employee they'd be arrested if they talked anymore.
[00:57:11.618 --> 00:57:13.839]  And the media acts like it's some big breaking news story.
[00:57:14.199 --> 00:57:17.301]  Every telecommunications hub is NSA run.
[00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:18.922]  It isn't the NSA's listening.
[00:57:19.222 --> 00:57:20.342]  It is the NSA.
[00:57:20.362 --> 00:57:20.843]  You understand?
[00:57:21.163 --> 00:57:22.263]  It is the NSA.
[00:57:22.483 --> 00:57:28.386]  They have whole floors locked off with NSA officers and private contractors, everything going through the grids.
[00:57:28.867 --> 00:57:30.187]  So that's what's happening there.
[00:57:30.408 --> 00:57:38.352]  We're going to end this hour, come back with George Humphreys, and on the other side we'll also be taking your calls, getting into the Iran war coming up.
[00:57:38.992 --> 00:57:40.733]  How can we hopefully stop it and a lot more?
[00:57:42.003 --> 00:57:48.524]  Before I end this hour, don't forget, coming up next week on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, I'm going to be showing my new film, Terror Storm, at the Alamo Draft House.
[00:57:48.564 --> 00:57:50.645]  Also giving a speech, 7 p.m.
[00:57:50.725 --> 00:57:51.205]  each night.
[00:57:51.245 --> 00:57:52.045]  Then I go to New York.
[00:57:52.105 --> 00:57:52.965]  I come back on the 12th.
[00:57:53.305 --> 00:57:56.966]  Then on the 13th and 14th, we'll also show it at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:57:57.226 --> 00:58:04.107]  If you're listening all over the country and want to get a copy of Terror Storm, the official Terror Storm is out with 66 minutes of extras on it as well.
[00:58:04.207 --> 00:58:05.488]  Over three hours long total.
[00:58:05.848 --> 00:58:07.388]  Most powerful film I've ever produced.

[00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:28.277]  It's a great activist tool.
[00:58:28.517 --> 00:58:30.838]  Go up there and download all my films, burn them to disc.
[00:58:31.138 --> 00:58:33.601]  And start the info war going to a new level.
[00:58:33.761 --> 00:58:34.782]  We can crush the enemy.
[00:58:34.962 --> 00:58:36.123]  We're going to crush the enemy.
[00:58:36.303 --> 00:58:37.144]  We're unstoppable.
[00:58:37.284 --> 00:58:39.547]  When you believe you're unstoppable, you are unstoppable.
[00:58:41.308 --> 00:58:46.213]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:58.291]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.972 --> 00:59:00.033]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.734 --> 00:59:01.856]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:03.298]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.079 --> 00:59:04.980]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.641 --> 00:59:09.306]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.826 --> 00:59:13.891]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.899 --> 00:59:16.480]  Who knows?
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:22.004]  If I can twist his arm, we might just keep him for the next two hours to ride shotgun with us.
[00:59:22.684 --> 00:59:29.609]  I remember back in 1996, I was more of a super right-wing conservative.
[00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:35.614]  I remember delivering Pat Buchanan signs around town.
[00:59:36.895 --> 00:59:45.201]  And I remember pulling up to the house, and the first time I met him, it was a city council member, just then former city council member, George Humphreys.
[00:59:46.158 --> 00:59:53.628]  Delivering Pat Buchanan signs to his yard, and the Buchananite I was with said, yeah, this guy's a big liberal, but he's for Buchanan.
[00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:57.914]  Yeah, back then people still couldn't get the shift in political paradigms.
[00:59:58.763 --> 00:59:59.203]  We're good to go.
[00:59:59.223 --> 00:59:59.964]  We're good to go.
[00:59:59.984 --> 01:00:00.584]  We're good to go.
[01:00:18.735 --> 01:00:19.795]  What's happening with the police state?
[01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:20.776]  Just a host of issues.
[01:00:20.816 --> 01:00:24.637]  Coming up in 20 minutes, we'll open the phones up and take your calls.
[01:00:24.657 --> 01:00:26.557]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:26.577 --> 01:00:27.318]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:29.378 --> 01:00:31.919]  George, thank you so much for being here with us, my friend.
[01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.300]  Alex, it's always a pleasure, man.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:42.783]  I've known you now for almost 10 years, and the growth that you have had in your presence and your knowledge and what you've done, you...
[01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:49.451]  For those of you who don't know, a lot of you hear Alex Jones, he kind of blusters and yells.
[01:00:49.551 --> 01:00:51.352]  This guy is a sweetheart.
[01:00:51.793 --> 01:00:53.394]  He's lots and lots of fun.
[01:00:53.434 --> 01:00:55.556]  He's got the sweetest smile there is.
[01:00:55.996 --> 01:01:00.079]  And the reason he's doing it is because he's got the heart the size of Texas.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.280]  Oh, please.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.781]  No, it's really, really true.
[01:01:02.881 --> 01:01:05.664]  And this guy, besides that, he's a warrior.
[01:01:05.724 --> 01:01:06.444]  And I love that.
[01:01:06.564 --> 01:01:08.486]  And there's not many warriors left.
[01:01:09.148 --> 01:01:26.266]  And that's what he is doing, what I am doing, what others are doing, doing our best to instill the truth, the message of what is really going on in this country of ours, in this world of ours, in the massive, massive, massive corruption.
[01:01:26.607 --> 01:01:29.510]  And unless each and every person who is listening...
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.783]  Really wakes up to their own power and to the Alex Jones energy inside of them.
[01:01:36.143 --> 01:01:38.044]  We're cooked, but we're going to do it.
[01:01:38.405 --> 01:01:42.967]  Because his energy, my energy, your energy, it's contagious.
[01:01:43.007 --> 01:01:44.228]  We're telling the truth.
[01:01:44.728 --> 01:01:45.969]  We love this country.
[01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:47.710]  We believe in the Constitution.
[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.071]  We believe in the Republic.
[01:01:49.391 --> 01:01:51.612]  And we believe in the goodness of people.
[01:01:51.932 --> 01:01:53.213]  And that's why we're here.
[01:01:54.955 --> 01:02:01.439]  What are some of the things you... I mean, I mentioned some of the things I'd like you to talk to us today about, George, but what are some of the issues you want to cover?
[01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:03.741]  Well, dadgum, Alex, I'm just like you.
[01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:12.567]  I could close my eyes and press a button and talk for ten hours on almost any of these issues, but quite clearly, the five-year anniversary of 9-11 is coming.
[01:02:13.127 --> 01:02:18.811]  And 9-11 was a momentous and evil and horrible, horrible, horrible event.
[01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:20.057]  We're good to go.
[01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:42.832]  We're good to go.
[01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:43.933]  We're good to go.
[01:03:01.387 --> 01:03:03.088]  Saying, what is the truth here?
[01:03:03.168 --> 01:03:04.749]  Let's really look at the issues.
[01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:08.211]  And at the time, that took a lot of courage.
[01:03:08.332 --> 01:03:15.036]  I had a lot of very, very, very dear friends who were good people who got in my face and who got so mad at me.
[01:03:15.056 --> 01:03:24.401]  I remember even some of the folks that ran your show got upset and yelled at me in the hallway the day of 9-11 and said, how dare you say this?
[01:03:24.782 --> 01:03:25.942]  Exactly.
[01:03:26.463 --> 01:03:29.945]  And thank God is that...
[01:03:30.798 --> 01:03:34.201]  Most of these people have come around and now understand.
[01:03:34.582 --> 01:03:36.283]  And we are turning the tide.
[01:03:36.924 --> 01:03:47.453]  Friends who are listening out there, Alex has gone over the information ad nauseum, but we're going to keep doing it because this is the break in the dam.
[01:03:47.713 --> 01:03:51.136]  If we can get people to understand... They gamble and they're going to lose.
[01:03:51.176 --> 01:03:51.857]  We'll be right back, George.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.622]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.883]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.283 --> 01:04:09.947]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:17.670]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.071 --> 01:04:20.992]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.352 --> 01:04:23.713]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.134 --> 01:04:24.974]  NSA spies.
[01:04:26.387 --> 01:04:29.489]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:33.310]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:35.691]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:39.913]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:04:40.473 --> 01:04:47.916]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:54.798 --> 01:04:55.859]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.943]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.223 --> 01:05:03.368]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.808 --> 01:05:04.629]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:09.535]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.015 --> 01:05:12.098]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.603 --> 01:05:27.316]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:34.482]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:34.782 --> 01:05:37.945]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.547]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:44.288]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:05:44.328 --> 01:05:48.629]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world, quote-unquote.
[01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.930]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:09.173 --> 01:06:10.754]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.663]  Call 888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[01:07:07.628 --> 01:07:32.758]  All our times have come We're fucked now, let it go Seasons don't feel the reaper Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain Come on baby, don't feel the reaper Baby, take my hand, don't
[01:07:34.287 --> 01:07:36.296]  We're good to go.
[01:08:23.107 --> 01:08:25.708]  We're good to go.
[01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:38.893]  Welcome back, my friends, on this August 30, 2006 edition.
[01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:50.020]  We've got George Humphreys, economist by training, a degree in economics, also a former Austin City Council member, documentary filmmaker, author, and a good friend of mine.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:57.645]  He was fighting the New World Order before anybody even knew what it was here in Austin, Texas, and we're so honored to have him here today with us.
[01:08:57.665 --> 01:09:01.128]  I want to get into Israel and Herat's reporting that
[01:09:01.977 --> 01:09:02.537]  We're good to go.
[01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:40.361]  Alex, I've said this probably 30 times on my television show, is that you make my job so much easier.
[01:09:41.401 --> 01:09:57.348]  And I'll tell you what, Alex is really, he's the icebreaker, and I love all the information, and his new movie, Terror Storm, is not, I had 15 people over at my house the other night, and we all watched it.
[01:09:58.028 --> 01:10:00.349]  And some of them were Alex fans, some of them weren't.
[01:10:00.996 --> 01:10:18.257]  And at the end of the movie, every single person clapped, and they all said it was the very finest job you've ever done, and not only the best you've ever done, but very, very informative and very entertaining and just A, number one.
[01:10:18.417 --> 01:10:19.158]  Good job, Alex.
[01:10:19.418 --> 01:10:21.340]  Well, I just hope that people will see the film.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:24.283]  I hope they'll get the high-quality DVD that we've produced.
[01:10:24.664 --> 01:10:26.726]  I hope they'll make copies of it aggressively.
[01:10:27.166 --> 01:10:29.929]  But we've also uploaded it for free to Google Video.
[01:10:29.949 --> 01:10:31.791]  There's a lot of bad copies of it on Google Video.
[01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:35.155]  You need to find the one that says deluxe or high-quality
[01:10:35.715 --> 01:10:37.817]  And we have links to that on Infowars.com.
[01:10:37.897 --> 01:10:39.378]  Rents.com's got a big link to it.
[01:10:39.979 --> 01:10:42.201]  You can also link to it over at JonesReport.com.
[01:10:42.581 --> 01:10:53.450]  Now, if you go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a membership and get an even higher quality version, because Google downloads it a bit, but I am a little bit upset that the bad quality versions that people uploaded wrong are all over the web.
[01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.112]  That's what millions of people are now watching.
[01:10:55.392 --> 01:11:00.056]  Help us get the high quality version out to people that is much more watchable online.
[01:11:00.276 --> 01:11:01.357]  Let me interrupt you there.
[01:11:01.397 --> 01:11:02.117]  We're good to go.
[01:11:02.177 --> 01:11:02.738]  We're good to go.
[01:11:21.913 --> 01:11:30.221]  And if you get the copy from you, it is so well done, it's so professional, and then you can possibly burn it from there.
[01:11:30.281 --> 01:11:31.902]  But have your friends come on over.
[01:11:31.962 --> 01:11:37.608]  Have 5, 10, 15 of your friends come over and have some popcorn or whatever and watch it.
[01:11:37.968 --> 01:11:43.353]  And it's a very interesting, well done, professional movie.
[01:11:43.573 --> 01:11:45.354]  Well, we did it in the modern format.
[01:11:45.414 --> 01:11:51.217]  Fast-moving, a lot of graphics, a lot of information, because we know the general public has lost their attention span.
[01:11:51.757 --> 01:11:54.918]  And we did put it together so that the general public would like it.
[01:11:55.459 --> 01:11:56.619]  Yeah, it's just super.
[01:11:59.284 --> 01:12:18.176]  Your movie and along with other documentaries and books that have come out and are coming out are absolutely blowing the lid off of any defense that anybody has for the fairy tale that's called the 9-11 Commission Report or the government story.
[01:12:19.116 --> 01:12:21.378]  George, we know we're in a race.
[01:12:21.498 --> 01:12:23.800]  We know we're in a race to wake people up to 9-11.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.461]  Why are we in a race?
[01:12:26.021 --> 01:12:41.591]  Well, for a lot of reasons, but it's very, very clear to anybody who's studied that, that the next Hegelian event, which is thesis, antithesis, synthesis, or in English, problem, reaction, solution, is coming up.
[01:12:41.651 --> 01:12:48.236]  We've got an election coming up in November, and I wouldn't put it past these rascals to have something in the next two, you know,
[01:12:48.896 --> 01:12:50.157]  Two to six weeks.
[01:12:50.317 --> 01:12:51.898]  Everybody's seeing that on the tea leaves.
[01:12:51.918 --> 01:12:52.378]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:58.481]  I mean, now, if it doesn't happen, we need to say a special prayer and say thank God.
[01:12:58.981 --> 01:13:11.447]  But clearly, clearly, clearly, from Randy Weaver to Oklahoma and Waco to the TWA flight to this and to what happened in England, it's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:13:11.927 --> 01:13:16.649]  And the power elite, whatever you want to call these folks, I call them the rascals sometimes.
[01:13:16.989 --> 01:13:18.009]  They're getting desperate.
[01:13:18.049 --> 01:13:24.152]  They know that the number of people waking up and so their only defense is fear.
[01:13:24.912 --> 01:13:26.633]  Their only defense is fear.
[01:13:27.033 --> 01:13:33.496]  And we have to go forward boldly and with confidence with the facts, with the objective facts.
[01:13:33.556 --> 01:13:35.336]  We don't have to improvise.
[01:13:35.376 --> 01:13:38.918]  We don't have to make the things bigger than they are.
[01:13:39.178 --> 01:13:40.978]  We can understate everything.
[01:13:41.319 --> 01:13:44.900]  But it is so obvious and provable that
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:45.801]  It is amazing, folks.
[01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:47.382]  And what we're dealing with is so big...
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:25.310]  The Matrix is so subtle that I study this every day and almost once a week, my shift, something comes up and I go, oh my goodness, I can't believe it's that big right now.
[01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:37.379]  And Alex is talking about, I'm talking about my television show, there's Radio Free Austin, there's Genesis, there's Republic Broadcasting, there's all these great new books and
[01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:40.820]  I want to say a little plug for my book.
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:42.300]  It's 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.541]  That's just coming out in a new updated version.
[01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:47.722]  As a matter of fact, I'm picking it up today.
[01:14:47.742 --> 01:14:48.302]  Great.
[01:14:48.322 --> 01:14:49.163]  We'll be carrying it here.
[01:14:49.183 --> 01:14:50.043]  We carry all your stuff.
[01:14:50.203 --> 01:14:50.803]  Absolutely.
[01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:52.304]  And we'll go into that in a little bit.
[01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:56.805]  Alex has said this over and over and over again.
[01:14:57.595 --> 01:15:03.158]  It is not going to be a battle of guns or lead at this moment, and hopefully never.
[01:15:03.478 --> 01:15:06.959]  It's going to be about information, and the information is out there.
[01:15:07.359 --> 01:15:13.242]  And for any of those thickheads who don't want to hear about it, as Jesus said, don't cast pearls before swine.
[01:15:13.702 --> 01:15:17.284]  Go to the people who are at least somewhat open-minded.
[01:15:17.564 --> 01:15:25.928]  And if you have Alex's books or tapes or my books or tapes, you can give this to them, and you can absolutely prove beyond a doubt...
[01:15:26.508 --> 01:15:37.151]  That 9-11 was a masquerade, was an illusion, was part of the gambit to create the fear element throughout this planet.
[01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:39.171]  And they're doing an incredible job.
[01:15:39.531 --> 01:15:41.692]  But the dam is breaking right now.
[01:15:41.852 --> 01:15:43.993]  And it's not up to Alex or me now.
[01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:45.053]  We're doing our job.
[01:15:45.693 --> 01:15:47.014]  Every single one of you.
[01:15:47.134 --> 01:15:48.835]  Yeah, the ball is in the people's courts.
[01:15:49.335 --> 01:16:03.242]  You talk about them overreaching, and they certainly did overreach because they've gotten away with so many other incredible hoaxes, but I wonder why they miscalculated, because clearly they've miscalculated, and they're pretty freaked out now that the majority of Americans believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:16:03.502 --> 01:16:08.705]  Well, clearly within the Illuminati, there's always polarities within the Illuminati and the neocons.
[01:16:09.585 --> 01:16:10.366]  We're good to go.
[01:16:33.283 --> 01:16:42.671]  And friends, at first this was very, very, it still is very scary to me, but as Alex and I were saying, it is a great and wonderful time to be alive right now.
[01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:46.134]  We were talking during the break, it's just, I mean, we're at a major crossroads.
[01:16:46.154 --> 01:16:50.017]  We're living in some of the most important historical developments ever.
[01:16:50.237 --> 01:17:01.287]  Yeah, and it's fun to be embodied right now, so that, you know, and if you do believe in truth and justice, and if you believe in God, and if you believe in the Republic, and you believe in goodness to other people,
[01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:25.065]  It is a wonderful time to be alive, to share the truth, to get out there and not be afraid, and not be hateful, to be angry, but not to be hateful, but to carry this information saying, look, we as human beings, not just as Texans, not just as Americans, but as human beings, we have some very significant choices in front of us.
[01:17:25.914 --> 01:17:26.294]  We do.
[01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:34.976]  I mean, look, the New World Order using 9-11, as I say, is their big foundation event, and they're openly telling us what they're going to do.
[01:17:35.136 --> 01:17:36.557]  Get rid of our country entirely.
[01:17:36.917 --> 01:17:41.438]  Flood us with unlimited foreigners to turn us into a third world cesspool.
[01:17:42.138 --> 01:17:44.799]  CPS is increasing the number of children they grab every week.
[01:17:45.459 --> 01:17:48.440]  They're now trying to force more and more deadly vaccines on the public.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.843]  All of this, they want to base all the meat and viruses.
[01:17:52.183 --> 01:17:54.546]  They want to put more and more mercury in them.
[01:17:54.786 --> 01:17:56.647]  I mean, there are thousands of things they're doing.
[01:17:57.008 --> 01:18:02.253]  They want the police state so they can force more and more of these horrors on us.
[01:18:02.273 --> 01:18:05.015]  I mean, we don't have a choice here, folks.
[01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:08.338]  There's no easy way out as I won't back down states.
[01:18:08.719 --> 01:18:12.903]  Yeah, and I think it was Johnny Cash who was saying, I won't back down.
[01:18:13.664 --> 01:18:23.574]  And I'll tell you what, that song by Tom Petty, I love rock and roll and he's one of my very favorites, but I'll tell you what, we don't need to back down.
[01:18:23.614 --> 01:18:34.666]  Our numbers are growing, but we have to at this moment, right now, if every single one of you can commit to connecting with at least two people a day for the...
[01:18:34.966 --> 01:18:35.687]  We're good to go.
[01:18:53.624 --> 01:19:01.868]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:02.128 --> 01:19:06.470]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:15.694]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.894 --> 01:19:19.516]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:20.457]  We're good to go.
[01:19:20.538 --> 01:19:20.818]  I think?
[01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:38.998]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:19:39.038 --> 01:19:40.139]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[01:19:53.345 --> 01:19:54.325]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.406 --> 01:19:59.188]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:59.348 --> 01:20:07.151]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:12.774]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:12.994 --> 01:20:19.977]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:20.878]  We're good to go.
[01:20:20.938 --> 01:20:21.078]  I think?
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.102]  Gold, on its own, has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:45.423 --> 01:20:47.064]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.365 --> 01:20:49.866]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.966 --> 01:20:56.090]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.811 --> 01:21:02.034]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:21:02.895 --> 01:21:09.740]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:21:10.817 --> 01:21:19.401]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:28.505]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:55.083 --> 01:21:57.924]  Have you been noticing that something is different in the world today?
[01:21:58.545 --> 01:22:02.127]  Nostradamus said that at the turn of the last century, things would reverse.
[01:22:02.527 --> 01:22:05.209]  That good would become bad, and bad would become good.
[01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:08.711]  That there would be a crossover, and we would enter the apocalypse.
[01:22:09.264 --> 01:22:11.406]  You cannot deny that his words have come to pass.
[01:22:12.066 --> 01:22:13.167]  What does this mean for us?
[01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:18.030]  Jerry Vano has written a book entitled The Uncovering of the Greatest Story Never Told.
[01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:27.937]  He explains mysteries that have been kept from the masses by the ruling powers about our origin and purpose for being and about the apocalyptic time we live in and the results in the year 2012.
[01:22:28.217 --> 01:22:33.241]  You can get the book on the internet at Amazon.com or Barnes & Noble.
[01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:36.223]  It can be bought in paperback, e-book, and talking book.
[01:22:36.703 --> 01:22:38.745]  The Uncovering of the Greatest Story Never Told
[01:22:39.244 --> 01:22:47.162]  Visit Jerry Vano's homepage at www.gvano.com Again, that's www.gvano.com
[01:23:02.005 --> 01:23:02.605]  We're good to go.
[01:23:32.767 --> 01:23:46.395]  Six years in the Air Force, and it makes me sad to hear when people terrorize this woman up in Connecticut, you know, to think that, you know, I thought I was doing something good for my country, and here we got people back here saying, oh, support the war, support the war, but yet they're going to attack this woman.
[01:23:46.415 --> 01:23:49.296]  That's one of our... Yeah, they're attacking the basic tenets.
[01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:51.077]  They're saying there is no free speech.
[01:23:51.478 --> 01:23:52.738]  You shouldn't have free speech.
[01:23:52.798 --> 01:23:54.659]  America is all about no freedom.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.320]  No, America's about freedom.
[01:23:56.921 --> 01:24:01.083]  You people are the traitors, the people that intimidate folks that are trying to tell the truth.
[01:24:01.821 --> 01:24:02.321]  Exactly.
[01:24:02.361 --> 01:24:04.723]  And I especially want to thank you and her, Alex.
[01:24:04.763 --> 01:24:06.024]  I mean, you're doing a great job.
[01:24:06.504 --> 01:24:08.406]  I've been hooked since around springtime.
[01:24:08.426 --> 01:24:11.228]  I just had two things I wanted to say.
[01:24:11.268 --> 01:24:19.794]  The first was, I wonder if you heard the radio interview with Davin Coburn on the Charles Goyette Show?
[01:24:20.795 --> 01:24:24.577]  A lot of people have been bringing up that interview where they had the Popular Mechanics people on.
[01:24:24.978 --> 01:24:25.218]  Yes.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:30.903]  And where the Popular Mechanics hit piece with Hearst Publishing, they were bumbling all around?
[01:24:31.363 --> 01:24:31.583]  Yes.
[01:24:31.863 --> 01:24:39.287]  And David Coburn, he said that they knew the hijackers, you know, it was them because they had DNA evidence.
[01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:40.968]  Which is totally made up.
[01:24:41.008 --> 01:24:46.691]  And then they also claim that they had photos of Building 7 being hit by the North Tower, but they can't show them to us.
[01:24:47.071 --> 01:24:48.692]  We have photos all the way around the building.
[01:24:48.932 --> 01:24:50.093]  It wasn't hit by the North Tower.
[01:24:50.802 --> 01:24:57.743]  Well, as I say, I wonder, I mean, if they do have the DNA evidence, I mean, what terrorist just walks in and the doctor says, hey, I've got to do a terrorist attack next week.
[01:24:58.103 --> 01:25:00.304]  Here's my DNA so you can identify me later.
[01:25:00.684 --> 01:25:00.944]  Sure.
[01:25:01.164 --> 01:25:05.825]  I mean, the government claimed that passports fell out of the fire, and then it turned out the names were fakes.
[01:25:05.845 --> 01:25:07.325]  They said, oh, just forget that story.
[01:25:07.345 --> 01:25:10.046]  There's clear evidence of them planning the passports.
[01:25:10.766 --> 01:25:11.506]  George, you want to comment?
[01:25:11.746 --> 01:25:16.427]  Yeah, the amazing thing is that for the last four and a half years on my television show and my radio shows,
[01:25:16.888 --> 01:25:24.063]  I have put out an offer that I would debate any newscaster, any politician, anybody who supports the story of 9-11.
[01:25:24.103 --> 01:25:25.887]  I know that Alex has done the same thing.
[01:25:26.753 --> 01:25:28.755]  Popular Mechanics has said they will not come on the show.
[01:25:28.795 --> 01:25:43.927]  And not one, and I've sent my book out to over a thousand elected representatives saying we can discuss the details, we won't argue, we'll have a very, very gentlemanly conversation, and we will talk about the facts.
[01:25:44.308 --> 01:25:50.353]  Not one single newscaster, not one single politician has even responded.
[01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:53.715]  I have one other thing, Alex, that I wanted to talk about real quick.
[01:25:54.016 --> 01:25:54.516]  Sure.
[01:25:55.057 --> 01:25:55.257]  On the
[01:25:56.201 --> 01:26:04.446]  As far as the popular mechanics goes, I saw a thing in the claim that WTC7 was brought down by fire.
[01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:17.734]  In the popular mechanics article, there was a Shahid Samad or something from the NIST or whatever that they highlighted, and he quoted that there was no firefighting in WTC7.
[01:26:18.414 --> 01:26:25.318]  But Larry Silverstein said we had firefighters in there, and we said to pull them or whatever instead of the whole we brought the building down dealie.
[01:26:25.748 --> 01:26:28.150]  So there's just another conflict of stories.
[01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:30.152]  NIST says there was no firefighting.
[01:26:30.992 --> 01:26:32.334]  That's right.
[01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:33.494]  I appreciate your call, Brandon.
[01:26:33.514 --> 01:26:36.337]  Good to have you on board with us here in the fight for humanity.
[01:26:37.538 --> 01:26:38.058]  It's simple.
[01:26:39.039 --> 01:26:41.821]  In the PBS documentary, Rebuilding America's Defenses from 2000,
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.882]  They clearly stayed in there that afternoon.
[01:26:47.942 --> 01:26:49.082]  We had such a loss of life.
[01:26:49.102 --> 01:26:50.122]  The building was on fire.
[01:26:50.543 --> 01:26:52.524]  We made the decision to pull it.
[01:26:52.664 --> 01:26:55.265]  Then they gave that order, and we watched the building go down.
[01:26:55.625 --> 01:27:06.870]  The next scene in the film, or about two scenes later, it shows them going, getting ready to pull building six months after when they're demolishing the wreckage of the other buildings that burned for days but didn't collapse.
[01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:09.631]  So it's a known definition of pull it.
[01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:10.572]  Silverstein said it.
[01:27:10.872 --> 01:27:13.593]  Firefighters and others said they were told to get back that day they were going to pull it.
[01:27:14.033 --> 01:27:19.976]  And Silverstein, two years after we broke this story, said, okay, all I'm going to say is we pulled the firefighters out.
[01:27:20.417 --> 01:27:21.997]  Okay, there were never firefighters in there.
[01:27:22.017 --> 01:27:23.038]  They never fought the fire.
[01:27:23.058 --> 01:27:26.059]  So, yes, it's a total and complete lie.
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:26.620]  George?
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:28.721]  Yeah, and it's just a fact.
[01:27:29.361 --> 01:27:31.562]  I have a cousin who is working for J.P.
[01:27:31.602 --> 01:27:32.943]  Morgan who is on the top floor of
[01:27:33.383 --> 01:27:34.724]  Building number seven at the time.
[01:27:34.784 --> 01:27:38.646]  And he saw not one, but both the planes hit the buildings.
[01:27:39.066 --> 01:27:41.828]  And he was one of the last people to get out of the building.
[01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:48.552]  The firefighters were pulled out of the building at approximately 1225.
[01:27:49.273 --> 01:27:50.813]  There were no firefighters there.
[01:27:51.234 --> 01:27:56.477]  What Larry Silverstein has said is an absolute fabrication of the truth.
[01:27:57.417 --> 01:28:01.860]  And if you have the owner of the building saying on tape,
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.781]  That they're going to bring down the building.
[01:28:05.001 --> 01:28:06.221]  What more evidence?
[01:28:06.901 --> 01:28:09.242]  We made the decision to bring down the building.
[01:28:09.262 --> 01:28:09.802]  We got the club.
[01:28:09.822 --> 01:28:11.042]  We played it like 50 times.
[01:28:11.062 --> 01:28:12.463]  We can play it again.
[01:28:12.983 --> 01:28:17.244]  And then you have the firemen out in front saying the building's going to come down.
[01:28:17.264 --> 01:28:18.864]  They knew what was going to happen.
[01:28:19.264 --> 01:28:20.585]  It's absolutely provable.
[01:28:20.945 --> 01:28:24.686]  And the 9-11 Commission report absolutely ignored this.
[01:28:25.427 --> 01:28:28.109]  Well, they also have given five different reasons seven collapsed.
[01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:30.250]  Now they've withdrawn the fifth a few months ago.
[01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:31.651]  They just said, we don't know why.
[01:28:31.992 --> 01:28:32.472]  Right, right.
[01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:42.139]  And in your movie, where you show where it's crimping, you've probably done the best job of anybody explaining how building number seven came down.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:44.881]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:46.942]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.962 --> 01:28:50.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:29:00.485]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[01:29:00.765 --> 01:29:06.309]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:13.194]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:20.219]  This patented, steel-reinforced, concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[01:29:20.459 --> 01:29:29.505]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[01:29:29.745 --> 01:29:33.227]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[01:29:33.528 --> 01:29:36.930]  Its many self-sufficient and high-security features will amaze you.
[01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:44.653]  With nuclear World War III looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey, ready for a new owner.

[01:30:55.768 --> 01:30:59.950]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:01.930]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:31:02.210 --> 01:31:08.553]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:31:08.853 --> 01:31:15.015]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:31:15.275 --> 01:31:22.758]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:31:23.118 --> 01:31:23.398]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:31:54.278 --> 01:31:57.022]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.042 --> 01:32:00.967]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.433 --> 01:32:08.938]  We're going to go back to your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:10.367 --> 01:32:13.488]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:32:13.908 --> 01:32:19.511]  My websites are Infowars.com and Infowars.net, as well as PrisonPlanet.tv and now JonesReport.com.
[01:32:19.831 --> 01:32:24.293]  Before we do that, I want to get into Iran, why the globalists need war, why they want war.
[01:32:24.813 --> 01:32:27.454]  It's another case of problem-reaction solution.
[01:32:27.854 --> 01:32:35.477]  I also want to remind you that we carry all of George Humphrey's books and videos and books on tape at the online store.
[01:32:35.797 --> 01:32:36.437]  We're good to go.
[01:32:55.526 --> 01:32:57.468]  George, also give the listeners your website.
[01:33:10.442 --> 01:33:13.644]  FearOrLove.com.
[01:33:13.985 --> 01:33:20.951]  My good friend Leah Lewis is in charge there, and she is a lovely, lovely person, and she will take care of you and will get you good information.
[01:33:20.991 --> 01:33:30.719]  So either buy it through InfoWars.com or FearOrLove, and you'll get great information at a low cost, and you can use this to convince your friends of the truth.
[01:33:31.039 --> 01:33:31.760]  Absolutely.
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:36.424]  And you also authorize folks, or Leah Lewis does, to make copies of the videos?
[01:33:37.224 --> 01:33:37.784]  Absolutely.
[01:33:37.884 --> 01:33:41.646]  And the prices are basically so low that you won't need to.
[01:33:41.686 --> 01:33:43.166]  But if you want to, absolutely.
[01:33:43.226 --> 01:33:45.327]  Because we're not doing this for the money.
[01:33:45.407 --> 01:33:46.607]  I can guarantee that.
[01:33:46.627 --> 01:33:47.847]  We're not doing it for the money.
[01:33:47.867 --> 01:33:49.308]  Well, I know you're not, George.
[01:33:50.148 --> 01:33:51.309]  Well, I know you're not either.
[01:33:51.349 --> 01:33:55.110]  I know with the energy you've got, you could be making a lot more bucks someplace else.
[01:33:55.470 --> 01:34:02.112]  But the point is that a lot of good patriots around the country are working their tails off to get this information out.
[01:34:02.792 --> 01:34:10.476]  And if you can just avail yourself of buying Terror Storm from Alex or buying 9-1-1, The Great Illusion from Alex.
[01:34:10.976 --> 01:34:16.739]  And I'll tell you what, my documentary was one of the first ones out with Alex's and Eric Huffschmidt's.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:24.303]  And I look back on the things that Eric and myself and Alex did three years ago, and they're still just cutting edge.
[01:34:24.603 --> 01:34:27.565]  If you show this movie to anybody, you're going to hook them.
[01:34:28.297 --> 01:34:28.737]  Absolutely.
[01:34:28.757 --> 01:34:35.459]  Well, I had the emergency release of Road to Tyranny out three weeks after 9-11, and then in February I had the official Road to Tyranny out.
[01:34:35.819 --> 01:34:44.722]  Then, of course, we made Masters of Terror, Road to Tyranny, and all of these films are really still more cutting edge than a lot of the new films that are coming out.
[01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:48.463]  Okay, we're going to go back to the calls here in a moment, but we have Harats here.
[01:34:49.444 --> 01:34:59.311]  Today, the big Israeli newspaper, where the government, the defense minister, has appointed a general to, quote, run the war with Iran that they say may be any day now.
[01:35:00.372 --> 01:35:02.954]  Why does Israel want to attack Iran?
[01:35:02.974 --> 01:35:08.798]  I mean, obviously they're not a threat compared to all the other countries in the area, like Pakistan, North Korea, China, Russia.
[01:35:08.858 --> 01:35:12.280]  Israel has 400 to 600 nukes, fifth biggest military in the world.
[01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:14.662]  Why are they so hyping this?
[01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:16.783]  Why do they want this war so bad?
[01:35:17.104 --> 01:35:18.985]  And what will it mean if they're able to get us into this?
[01:35:19.045 --> 01:35:21.666]  Well, because of fear and ignorance.
[01:35:21.686 --> 01:35:27.507]  The thing about it is, the majority of the Israeli people are waking up to the truth.
[01:35:27.547 --> 01:35:29.447]  They realize that their government... That's right.
[01:35:29.487 --> 01:35:30.968]  This war is about suppressing them.
[01:35:31.128 --> 01:35:32.008]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:32.308 --> 01:35:36.569]  They are getting... Getting them into a primitive war where the people will serve the government.
[01:35:36.809 --> 01:35:37.349]  Same thing here.
[01:35:37.369 --> 01:35:37.749]  Yeah.
[01:35:38.009 --> 01:35:40.850]  And absolutely, Israel cannot win this thing.
[01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:43.491]  I mean, they just cannot win this thing.
[01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:44.511]  And Bush has said, we'll go along with it.
[01:35:45.932 --> 01:35:50.136]  And I know a lot of good Israeli people who are fighting this.
[01:35:50.696 --> 01:35:58.963]  And there needs to be a lot more good Americans and especially Jewish Americans who wake up and say enough is enough.
[01:35:59.043 --> 01:36:06.949]  Because the leaders of the ADL, the leaders of these groups, of the neocons, they are out of their minds.
[01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:12.774]  They are either drunk with power or they are so scared or something is going on with these people.
[01:36:13.314 --> 01:36:13.814]  We're good to go.
[01:36:30.001 --> 01:36:33.542]  And the majority of the Bilderberg Group, they want world government, they want population reduction.
[01:36:33.562 --> 01:36:34.102]  They're evil.
[01:36:34.362 --> 01:36:36.102]  They're just more calculated and cold-blooded.
[01:36:36.442 --> 01:36:41.223]  And they're telling the neocons, you guys are really upsetting the whole apple cart here.
[01:36:41.603 --> 01:36:44.284]  And again, why are the neocons so out of control?
[01:36:44.324 --> 01:36:47.144]  Well, the EU, as you say, is the old school.
[01:36:47.184 --> 01:36:51.425]  They realize that incrementally they're getting exactly what they want.
[01:36:51.445 --> 01:36:53.365]  And the neocons are the new kids on the clock.
[01:36:53.525 --> 01:36:54.585]  They want all the power now.
[01:36:54.605 --> 01:36:56.506]  They want the power now, and they're pushing it.
[01:36:56.566 --> 01:36:57.286]  And I'll tell you what.
[01:36:58.049 --> 01:37:00.304]  There is so much...
[01:37:01.132 --> 01:37:09.114]  To consider about what is going on in the Middle East, and especially between the Israelis and the Arabs slash the Palestinians.
[01:37:09.374 --> 01:37:13.995]  A lot of things people don't realize is that Gaza is still in darkness.
[01:37:14.255 --> 01:37:18.336]  There are 1.4 million people in Gaza right now.
[01:37:18.356 --> 01:37:19.556]  Well, Iraq is in darkness.
[01:37:20.816 --> 01:37:26.397]  Baghdad gets like two hours of light a day, but the green zone is bowling alleys and hair salons and topless bars.
[01:37:27.377 --> 01:37:29.698]  People have no concept.
[01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:40.807]  Of the misery and of the fear and the degradation that's going on in Gaza and southern Lebanon and central Iraq right now.
[01:37:41.428 --> 01:37:45.329]  And all this stuff is coming back and it's going to be happening to the Israelis.
[01:37:45.829 --> 01:37:46.710]  If we speak up and work for justice.
[01:38:04.716 --> 01:38:10.920]  Well, the reasons for war, as Pat Buchanan said a few days ago on this broadcast on Monday, is the health of the state.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.581]  This is the way the system consolidates power.
[01:38:14.402 --> 01:38:25.869]  Even people who know about the New World Order right now, if we're getting hit by nukes, obviously getting hit by the New World Order, not by Iran, a lot of people will just primitively switch into groupthink, you know, the group mind, and go ahead and serve this system.
[01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:34.234]  So I think a large contingent of the New World Order, we know, a large contingent of the Global Crime Syndicate, wants this earth-shattering chain of events...
[01:38:35.155 --> 01:38:44.723]  This bone-shattering chain of events to force people into line to accept the American Union, North American Union, the Pan-American Union, to accept the police state, to accept all of this.
[01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:45.724]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:45.844 --> 01:38:50.528]  And they truly believe, going way back to May 1st, 1776, when Adam Weishoff...
[01:38:53.254 --> 01:38:54.635]  Power out of chaos.
[01:38:54.775 --> 01:38:55.935]  Power out of chaos.
[01:38:56.056 --> 01:38:58.497]  Create the chaos, and then we take the power.
[01:38:58.637 --> 01:39:11.984]  And the eye of the storm, from their point of view, which is the economic, political, media, the cultural institutions that are controlled by these rascals, is that they are getting more power, at least from their point of view.
[01:39:12.384 --> 01:39:14.145]  It's like a hurricane.
[01:39:14.265 --> 01:39:16.646]  And it creates more and more and more power.
[01:39:16.947 --> 01:39:19.328]  And so the more they get, the more they want.
[01:39:20.009 --> 01:39:29.000]  But I'll tell you what, it's all based upon a cracked foundation, and it's up to each one of us to continue cracking that foundation.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:34.768]  Well, it's also based on good people being gullible by their propaganda and adding power into their system.
[01:39:34.948 --> 01:39:36.250]  Yeah, and folks...
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:46.742]  Either we live in a republic, and we have a constitution, and we have a Bill of Rights, and that 10th Bill in the Bill of Rights is limited government.
[01:39:47.002 --> 01:39:49.543]  Now, can the people of Austin, Texas take care of themselves?
[01:39:49.843 --> 01:39:50.663]  Of course they can.
[01:39:50.743 --> 01:39:53.864]  Can the people of Ann Arbor, Michigan take care of themselves?
[01:39:53.924 --> 01:39:54.804]  Of course they can.
[01:39:55.144 --> 01:39:59.565]  People all around this country and all around the world can take care of themselves.
[01:39:59.605 --> 01:40:00.545]  And look what government does.
[01:40:00.605 --> 01:40:07.227]  Everything it does with the educational system, the media, everything, is to make us feel dependent, dumb us down, not give us the tools.
[01:40:07.587 --> 01:40:09.588]  Education is a great success in this country.
[01:40:09.628 --> 01:40:13.028]  It was designed, we have the official handbooks, to dumb you down.
[01:40:13.289 --> 01:40:14.669]  The drug war is a great success.
[01:40:14.729 --> 01:40:18.870]  More drugs, more people in prison, more control, more money in the banks being laundered.
[01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:31.301]  In 1990, I believe there were 157,000 people in federal prisons in the United States, and today there are over 2 million people in prisons in this country.
[01:40:31.441 --> 01:40:32.322]  And that's old numbers.
[01:40:32.422 --> 01:40:37.326]  It's actually 7 million in the system, 5 million behind bars, and you're right, over 2 million in prison.
[01:40:37.346 --> 01:40:37.726]  And federal.
[01:40:37.786 --> 01:40:38.207]  And federal.
[01:40:38.887 --> 01:40:42.129]  And is there ten times as much crime?
[01:40:42.209 --> 01:40:42.890]  No, there's not.
[01:40:43.530 --> 01:40:49.074]  Is that the absolute control by Wackenhut and these private prisons?
[01:40:49.174 --> 01:40:53.097]  Which are financed by big banks that we know are laundering drug money.
[01:40:53.377 --> 01:41:00.561]  Again, the drug dealers bring the drugs in, and then your kids use it, and they put you in private prisons owned by the drug dealers.
[01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:03.823]  And 67% of the people in prisons right now are nonviolent offenders.
[01:41:03.863 --> 01:41:08.586]  We're spending $64,000 a year per person to take care of these people.
[01:41:08.846 --> 01:41:11.148]  This is insanity, folks.
[01:41:11.168 --> 01:41:20.633]  $5 billion, not million, billion dollars a year just for federal people going to these private prisons, and then they're using these people as slave labor.
[01:41:20.853 --> 01:41:21.834]  This is just the fact.
[01:41:21.894 --> 01:41:28.464]  Well, all the studies, all the statistics show they take these 67% that are nonviolent, and I'm told that number just grew to 69 this year.
[01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:29.807]  We're getting now 2005 numbers a year late.
[01:41:31.363 --> 01:41:37.164]  That you take them, and statistically, though, a larger portion then comes out violent because it's like you're going to college.
[01:41:37.864 --> 01:41:39.105]  We caught you with some marijuana.
[01:41:39.345 --> 01:41:47.706]  You're going to go spend a year in the pen, and you're going to come back with AIDS or hepatitis C, and you're going to come out with tats all over you, and you're going to come out, and you're going to learn how to rob.
[01:41:47.987 --> 01:41:51.507]  Well, fortunately, I haven't had many friends who've ever spent any time in the big house.
[01:41:51.547 --> 01:41:54.728]  I've known a few people, and a couple people just got out a couple years ago.
[01:41:55.348 --> 01:41:56.629]  For drug offenses.
[01:41:57.170 --> 01:42:06.558]  And the stories that they told me, and even though they were in supposedly the safe prisons, the stories they told me were unbelievably violent.
[01:42:06.578 --> 01:42:10.662]  Listen, we've had four prisons within 30 miles of Austin.
[01:42:11.369 --> 01:42:11.990]  Shut down.
[01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:19.898]  And you'll see one little blurb in the paper that the guards were making porno videos and raping the women.
[01:42:20.458 --> 01:42:22.040]  And it's just, you know, boom.
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:28.626]  It's just in the paper once, and so this prison system is losing their contract and someone new is coming in.
[01:42:28.927 --> 01:42:30.809]  These are hell pits.
[01:42:30.949 --> 01:42:34.152]  Yeah, and it is the destruction of our country.
[01:42:35.828 --> 01:42:41.916]  Of our race, of our culture, if we treat people like animals, they're going to act like animals.
[01:42:41.936 --> 01:42:45.400]  Now, the human species is being turned into animals, and of course they know what they're doing.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:51.788]  Again, we have the same crime rate, roughly, that we had 20 years ago, but we have completely dwarfed
[01:42:52.288 --> 01:42:55.029]  It's something like 10 times the number of people we have in prison.
[01:42:55.529 --> 01:43:02.010]  20 years ago, I remember a state police officer, one time I was talking to him, and I said, you know, we're doubling the number of people in prison every five years.
[01:43:02.291 --> 01:43:04.091]  And he said, good, more people need to be in there.
[01:43:04.391 --> 01:43:08.292]  And I said, but wait a minute, countries where they don't have as many people in prison have lower crime rates.
[01:43:09.012 --> 01:43:12.133]  I mean, again, the prisons create more crime.
[01:43:12.693 --> 01:43:16.054]  And I used to help run the Austin Police Department, and I am...
[01:43:16.958 --> 01:43:20.384]  You all don't know me, most of you, but I am pro-cop.
[01:43:20.404 --> 01:43:22.086]  At least I used to be pro-cop.
[01:43:22.166 --> 01:43:25.431]  I'd be down at the cop shop two or three nights a week.
[01:43:25.491 --> 01:43:26.573]  I'd ride with the police.
[01:43:26.653 --> 01:43:27.394]  I helped them out.
[01:43:27.855 --> 01:43:30.980]  And we used to have peace officers.
[01:43:31.747 --> 01:43:35.849]  And if you look at Alex, and a lot of people say, oh, Alex is soft liberal.
[01:43:36.329 --> 01:43:37.209]  He ain't any bit.
[01:43:37.509 --> 01:43:39.970]  He believes in justice.
[01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:44.292]  He believes in the police department when they're doing their job.
[01:43:44.332 --> 01:43:46.013]  He is not soft on crime.
[01:43:46.513 --> 01:43:47.554]  I guarantee you.
[01:43:47.934 --> 01:43:53.976]  And the point is that we are pointing out factual information that is not good for our country.
[01:43:54.016 --> 01:43:55.657]  This is not because we have soft...
[01:43:55.917 --> 01:43:57.619]  Well, look, it doesn't matter.
[01:43:57.679 --> 01:44:00.301]  The more funding you get for education, the dumber we get.
[01:44:00.661 --> 01:44:03.584]  The bigger the war on terror gets, the more liberties we lose, the more terror.
[01:44:03.984 --> 01:44:07.027]  The bigger the war on drugs gets, the more drugs we have.
[01:44:07.287 --> 01:44:10.290]  What, last numbers I saw was triple the heroin, double the cocaine.
[01:44:10.330 --> 01:44:18.217]  Yeah, you know, for example, an article today in the American Statesman, SAT scores dropped the most significantly in the last 31 years.
[01:44:18.237 --> 01:44:20.819]  Since 1965, SAT scores have gone down significantly.
[01:44:23.662 --> 01:44:24.662]  98% of the time.
[01:44:24.682 --> 01:44:31.007]  The United States was number one in test scores, in the amount of money people were making.
[01:44:31.447 --> 01:44:35.190]  At every level, at every indicator, every indices, we were number one.
[01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:36.591]  Folks, we are 20, 30, 50.
[01:44:36.911 --> 01:44:39.513]  In every case, we're behind.
[01:44:39.613 --> 01:44:42.495]  Every industrialized country and behind a bunch of third world countries.
[01:44:42.836 --> 01:44:44.977]  This was done scientifically.
[01:44:45.097 --> 01:44:51.062]  And Project 2000 is coming in to teach the median, not to raise the bar.
[01:44:51.762 --> 01:45:06.927]  Just like Alex has raised the bar with Terror Storm, is that we need to be raising the bar for our children and teaching the basics, getting them to be able to think, to learn values, to have ethics, to go back to the basics.
[01:45:07.207 --> 01:45:11.108]  And instead, since the government stepped in, this is just a fact,
[01:45:12.051 --> 01:45:18.838]  Quality of education that can be proven has gone down year after year after year.
[01:45:19.318 --> 01:45:20.700]  Folks, this is your money.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:21.861]  This is our children.
[01:45:22.682 --> 01:45:23.803]  This is our country.
[01:45:24.083 --> 01:45:25.224]  We have to say no.
[01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:27.727]  And for example, one of the biggest problems...
[01:45:28.327 --> 01:45:35.273]  In the school board elections around the country, the average percentage of registered voters who vote in school board elections is 6%.
[01:45:36.494 --> 01:45:37.275]  That's right.
[01:45:37.315 --> 01:45:38.996]  Local elections average is 8%.
[01:45:39.737 --> 01:45:46.843]  That's where it really matters, but you get 55-60% in a staged presidential election because the media tells you that's what's important.
[01:45:47.464 --> 01:45:47.964]  Exactly.
[01:45:48.064 --> 01:45:53.529]  And we have to, number one, we have to take care of ourselves physically and emotionally.
[01:45:53.989 --> 01:45:58.030]  Number two is that we have to get objective information about what's going on.
[01:45:58.271 --> 01:46:00.631]  We don't have to exaggerate or anything like that.
[01:46:00.931 --> 01:46:09.034]  Number three, we have to increase our numbers, and number four... Oh yeah, I disagree with you earlier when you said two and a half, five percent are awake.
[01:46:09.374 --> 01:46:19.538]  We have Gannett News Service polls, we have Zogby polls, where between 36 and 40 plus percent believe it's an inside job, 68 percent believing there's a cover-up, George,
[01:46:19.758 --> 01:46:20.539]  I agree with you.
[01:46:20.599 --> 01:46:22.261]  What we're talking about is where we set the level.
[01:46:22.301 --> 01:46:23.962]  You mean 5% that really are ready to take action?
[01:46:24.002 --> 01:46:24.243]  Pure.
[01:46:40.299 --> 01:46:42.020]  People are ready to take action.
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:52.046]  And as you've heard before, when the American Revolution started, there was only about 5% of the colonists who were ready to rock and roll and to work for freedom.
[01:46:52.747 --> 01:46:59.071]  And during the whole war, there were always more Tories than there were colonists who were working for independence.
[01:46:59.391 --> 01:47:01.032]  We don't have to have a majority.
[01:47:01.292 --> 01:47:07.054]  What we have to do is be right and be full in our hearts and do what is right for this country.
[01:47:07.174 --> 01:47:08.694]  People were really tough back then.
[01:47:08.714 --> 01:47:11.255]  They knew life was short and they were pretty rough.
[01:47:11.715 --> 01:47:13.216]  I wish we had people like that today.
[01:47:13.256 --> 01:47:19.758]  They worked out in the fields and they saw the seasons and they were outside and they said their prayers.
[01:47:20.718 --> 01:47:29.262]  And, you know, our country and our culture has become so soft, I am really saddened by what my tribe has done.
[01:47:29.402 --> 01:47:34.504]  I mean, we have the greatest, wealthiest country in the whole world, and what have we done?
[01:47:34.724 --> 01:47:39.126]  You know, there's an old saying, to those who have been given much, much is to be expected.
[01:47:39.506 --> 01:47:42.267]  And all of us... With great power comes great responsibility.
[01:47:42.347 --> 01:47:48.190]  And all of us have been given so much just to be born in this country with these opportunities.
[01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:48.410]  We're 4%
[01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:49.030]  We're good to go.
[01:48:11.997 --> 01:48:12.998]  A race with others.
[01:48:13.038 --> 01:48:16.359]  We're here to make our lives, our country, a better place.
[01:48:16.379 --> 01:48:22.101]  Well, the New World Order is using third world populations to break down our sovereignty and destroy this country for the North American Union.
[01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:24.122]  And they're doing a darn good job of it.
[01:48:24.743 --> 01:48:27.704]  And when the illegals get here, they fill them full of hate of this country.
[01:48:28.044 --> 01:48:35.752]  For the point of, all over the nation, the illegal aliens are pulling down American flags and putting up Mexican flags at city halls, and the government sits there and cheers them on.
[01:48:35.852 --> 01:48:37.834]  Yeah, this is just the most amazing thing in the world.
[01:48:37.874 --> 01:48:38.875]  We have U.S.
[01:48:38.915 --> 01:48:42.959]  troops stationed in minimally 115 countries.
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:47.684]  We have spent more on our military than all the other countries combined.
[01:48:48.473 --> 01:48:58.617]  And we have 4,000 miles of open borders, and we have at the minimum of 15 million undocumented workers in this country right now.
[01:48:59.077 --> 01:49:00.938]  This is insanity.
[01:49:01.138 --> 01:49:04.479]  And they're running around screaming, we're taking over, we're going to kill you.
[01:49:04.499 --> 01:49:10.661]  And when I say that, folks, the UT head of Chicano Studies in Arlington says all whites must be killed.
[01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:15.243]  And I want to say is that most of the undocumented I know
[01:49:16.503 --> 01:49:21.645]  But the people the government funds and the leaders are... Exactly.
[01:49:21.885 --> 01:49:28.467]  And so we have to be very careful to separate and give love to these people, but stand up for our own country.
[01:49:28.707 --> 01:49:29.547]  Well, exactly.
[01:49:29.627 --> 01:49:31.328]  No, I mean, that's what we're saying.
[01:49:31.348 --> 01:49:34.549]  The government goes and finds the worst and tries to put them in command.
[01:49:35.889 --> 01:49:39.030]  And, you know, we're sitting here going, you're saying you're going to kill us.
[01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:41.011]  Look, it's going to elicit a response.
[01:49:41.071 --> 01:49:43.272]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:49:43.292 --> 01:49:47.493]  You come for me and my family, you're going to unleash the beast, and you're not going to like what happens.
[01:49:47.853 --> 01:49:48.773]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:49:48.793 --> 01:49:49.213]  Stay with us.
[01:49:56.776 --> 01:49:59.757]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.330 --> 01:50:02.211]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.611 --> 01:50:10.295]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.975 --> 01:50:18.019]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.419 --> 01:50:21.360]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:24.062]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.482 --> 01:50:25.422]  NSA spying.
[01:50:25.802 --> 01:50:26.883]  Secret police torture.
[01:50:27.182 --> 01:50:29.864]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:50:30.144 --> 01:50:33.646]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.106 --> 01:50:36.027]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.367 --> 01:50:40.290]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:46.044 --> 01:51:46.304]  Thank you.
[01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:10.686]  We're good to go.
[01:52:10.706 --> 01:52:11.367]  We're good to go.
[01:52:39.685 --> 01:52:42.766]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.946 --> 01:52:48.908]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:58.511 --> 01:53:01.191]  We've been babbling like a tree full of monkeys here.
[01:53:01.212 --> 01:53:06.313]  We're going to open the phones up now in this segment and continuing just straight through until about 30 after, bottom of the next hour.
[01:53:06.333 --> 01:53:09.294]  Then I'm going to get into a whole bunch of other vital news and information.
[01:53:10.609 --> 01:53:12.830]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:14.370]  Let's talk to Steve in Illinois.
[01:53:14.410 --> 01:53:15.171]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:53:16.151 --> 01:53:16.831]  Hello, gentlemen.
[01:53:17.411 --> 01:53:21.553]  I worked in the Buchanan office in Chicago on Michigan Avenue in 1992.
[01:53:23.634 --> 01:53:24.474]  So I guess that was really 92.
[01:53:24.814 --> 01:53:27.595]  That was 92 when I met George.
[01:53:27.635 --> 01:53:27.935]  It wasn't 96.
[01:53:28.135 --> 01:53:28.836]  That's right.
[01:53:29.356 --> 01:53:30.316]  I get all this mixed up.
[01:53:30.336 --> 01:53:30.696]  Go ahead.
[01:53:30.916 --> 01:53:32.997]  So I've known you for how many years?
[01:53:33.017 --> 01:53:33.177]  14 years.
[01:53:33.197 --> 01:53:33.337]  14 years.
[01:53:33.397 --> 01:53:33.577]  Okay.
[01:53:36.061 --> 01:53:44.948]  Well, gentlemen, are you familiar with the Chicago Tribune article 816 ad pitch for Israel aimed at Christians, subtitled Evangelicals Provide Deep Will of Support?
[01:53:45.942 --> 01:53:49.584]  Well, yeah, what's happened is the government's come in, and now it's a faith-based initiative.
[01:53:49.604 --> 01:53:52.225]  They haven't just licensed the churches, which is against the First Amendment.
[01:53:52.685 --> 01:54:07.892]  Now they are telling them what they can and can't say, and Israel is really paying off many of the evangelical Christians who now are making it a religious tenet to support Israel when Christian proselytizing is illegal in Israel.
[01:54:07.912 --> 01:54:09.333]  And again, I'm not against Israel, folks.
[01:54:09.693 --> 01:54:12.474]  As George said, a lot of the folks over there don't like what's happening.
[01:54:12.494 --> 01:54:14.015]  The point is this is out of control, George.
[01:54:14.495 --> 01:54:15.776]  Well, yeah, I have several.
[01:54:16.256 --> 01:54:26.759]  Most of us have friends who are born-again Christians, and I have some very, very dear family members who live right in the shadow of Chicago over in Michigan who are born-again.
[01:54:26.899 --> 01:54:33.982]  And I'll tell you what, the stuff that they come up with, they are more pro-Israel than they are pro-America.
[01:54:34.142 --> 01:54:35.342]  It's just amazing.
[01:54:35.603 --> 01:54:36.523]  And they get this...
[01:54:37.416 --> 01:54:39.037]  Garbage from their church.
[01:54:39.277 --> 01:54:41.638]  And I'm going, what are you thinking about?
[01:54:41.658 --> 01:54:43.099]  But it's not even really pro-Israel.
[01:54:43.159 --> 01:54:45.000]  It's pro the crooks that run Israel.
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:45.640]  Exactly.
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:49.122]  It's pro what I call political Zionists.
[01:54:49.222 --> 01:54:53.984]  And it is against every facet of what Jesus taught.
[01:54:54.024 --> 01:54:56.385]  It's against what good Jewish people believe in.
[01:54:56.785 --> 01:54:58.686]  It's anti-American.
[01:54:58.946 --> 01:55:00.907]  And I'm going, where do you get this?
[01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:04.149]  Well, it's really just neocolonialism or imperialism.
[01:55:05.057 --> 01:55:05.977]  It's very aggressive.
[01:55:06.857 --> 01:55:16.939]  And the point is that this stuff wouldn't be happening if the born-again movement wasn't so strongly mind-controlled by the New World Order.
[01:55:17.679 --> 01:55:19.639]  If they were really born again, they'd have discernment.
[01:55:19.679 --> 01:55:21.260]  Thank you for the call, Steve.
[01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:24.120]  Brian in Kansas City, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:25.520]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:26.881 --> 01:55:34.302]  I'm 24, and while I was in high school, I had a high school history teacher who actually woke me up
[01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:48.492]  He teaches in his class about the New World Order, teaches about false flag terrorism, and actually every year we take, even I do this today, take a group of high school kids down to Dallas to research the JFK.
[01:55:48.512 --> 01:55:50.793]  Fantastic.
[01:55:50.833 --> 01:55:51.874]  I was just there over the weekend.
[01:55:52.315 --> 01:55:52.575]  Really?
[01:55:53.095 --> 01:55:53.255]  Yeah.
[01:55:53.275 --> 01:56:00.081]  Well, with Jim Mars comes a bunch of witnesses who was there that day and, you know, teach the high school kids.
[01:56:00.761 --> 01:56:02.783]  And, you know, I just thought that was really interesting, and, you know,
[01:56:04.025 --> 01:56:05.886]  I still partner with him.
[01:56:05.906 --> 01:56:12.849]  We're trying to get something together in December with Jim Mars in something in Kansas City.
[01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.489]  Good.
[01:56:13.649 --> 01:56:14.189]  Fantastic.
[01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.830]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:18.791]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Arizona.
[01:56:18.811 --> 01:56:19.472]  You're on the air.
[01:56:19.532 --> 01:56:19.912]  Go ahead.
[01:56:20.612 --> 01:56:21.292]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:21.352 --> 01:56:22.513]  This is Sean Glazier.
[01:56:23.893 --> 01:56:32.237]  I am going to be on Non-Random Thoughts with James Fetzer tomorrow for his second hour from 12 to 1.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:35.601]  That's great.
[01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:36.541]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:36.962 --> 01:56:42.386]  Listen, this is not a forum for just plugging and then, you know, plugging.
[01:56:42.506 --> 01:56:50.151]  I mean, I support Fetzer and all the things he does, but you really can't expect me to sit there and pretty obnoxiously try to plug radio shows that are on at the same time as mine.
[01:56:50.452 --> 01:56:51.312]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:56:51.853 --> 01:56:54.515]  We're going to break and come back with the...
[01:56:55.868 --> 01:56:59.970]  Next hour, and I'd like to give first-time callers a chance to get on board.
[01:57:00.170 --> 01:57:08.393]  I'm not saying you can't call if you routinely call, but if you haven't called in a while and never had a chance to get on board, we're going to have a huge blitz of your phone calls coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:08.413 --> 01:57:08.473]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:08.493 --> 01:57:13.175]  The websites are Infowars.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, and then we have George's site, which is FearLove.com.
[01:57:24.591 --> 01:57:25.152]  We're good to go.
[01:57:53.257 --> 01:57:55.499]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:57.241]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.822 --> 01:58:01.545]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.006 --> 01:58:06.070]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.765 --> 01:58:16.096]  Alright, my friends, George Humphries is our guest, economist, former city council member, anti-New World Order crusader, documentary filmmaker, author.
[01:58:16.717 --> 01:58:18.279]  Open phones in this hour.
[01:58:18.339 --> 01:58:22.985]  I want to get into some of the police state systems that are developing and get George's take on that.
[01:58:23.325 --> 01:58:24.787]  Also more on Israel and the U.S.
[01:58:24.807 --> 01:58:25.989]  and England wanting to go ahead and attack.
[01:58:26.389 --> 01:58:28.731]  Iran, Herat's announcing they've appointed a war general.
[01:58:28.971 --> 01:58:32.533]  They're openly saying they may strike any time, dragging us into the war.
[01:58:32.994 --> 01:58:40.699]  I, of course, have said I see a prime confluence of all the different evidence towards the government-sponsored terror attack in the next few months, unless we get the word out.
[01:58:40.999 --> 01:58:49.805]  And my alert hasn't even been carried by Fox News, and I've been all over the newspapers, and you have really gotten the word out, so we have a chance of backing them off and stopping them.
[01:58:50.165 --> 01:58:54.148]  Though the whole world's against attacking Iran, they're still beating the war drums, though.
[01:58:54.168 --> 01:58:56.009]  George Humphries, again, in studio with us.
[01:58:56.309 --> 01:58:58.551]  Right now, let's go to Joe in Wisconsin.
[01:58:58.591 --> 01:58:59.432]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:58:59.452 --> 01:59:00.473]  Hi, guys.
[01:59:00.773 --> 01:59:23.071]  I just wanted to preface this because I think the school, the UW system, and Milwaukee here, I just want everybody to know this is my opinion, but I have talked to many administrators and private professors, and they pretty much agree that the campus has been reduced to an indoctrination center, a
[01:59:25.101 --> 01:59:28.385]  A dating service and a job placement service.
[01:59:29.626 --> 01:59:40.958]  And Bill Gates is spending millions of dollars to ensure that all schools, public schools, and then secondary schools are, is basically placement centers for your minimum wage job.
[01:59:41.505 --> 01:59:46.108]  Well, the thing I wanted to touch on is I've been getting a lot of heat lately.
[01:59:46.488 --> 01:59:51.892]  And I know you don't like talking about it, and I didn't feel right talking about it either, but it's coming to the breaking point.
[01:59:51.952 --> 01:59:53.833]  I'm not saying that they're... You're not talking about what, sir?
[01:59:53.853 --> 01:59:55.094]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:59:55.234 --> 02:00:01.038]  They've used color of law to give me four letters of restriction.
[02:00:01.118 --> 02:00:06.922]  I'm basically banned from four public buildings, from using public terminals for public internet.
[02:00:07.586 --> 02:00:09.467]  What do you mean I don't like talking about it?
[02:00:10.427 --> 02:00:12.928]  I talk about restrictions on free speech constantly.
[02:00:12.948 --> 02:00:13.688]  No, no, no.
[02:00:14.088 --> 02:00:17.630]  Personally, I mean, you don't like talking about yourself being restricted.
[02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:21.151]  I don't like talking about it myself because it takes away from important issues.
[02:00:21.171 --> 02:00:22.331]  Well, let me give you an example.
[02:00:22.471 --> 02:00:32.175]  If you visit InfoWars.com at Dell Computer during your lunch hour, you're allowed to visit any site you want as long as it's not hate, hacking, porn, or gambling, and I'm considered hate.
[02:00:32.895 --> 02:00:35.576]  And I know eight people who've been fired for it.
[02:00:35.917 --> 02:00:39.378]  Most of the libraries around the country, you can't get to my websites, the filtering software.
[02:00:39.598 --> 02:00:48.282]  We bought a new computer that came installed with, quote, safety filtering software and couldn't visit all my sites, or a bunch of them, until we removed it.
[02:00:48.622 --> 02:00:51.484]  So yes, this is going on all over the place.
[02:00:52.424 --> 02:00:56.226]  Winston Churchill once said, if you're not liberal when you're 18, you have no heart.
[02:00:56.306 --> 02:00:58.827]  Not conservative when you're 35, you have no brains.
[02:00:59.407 --> 02:01:24.703]  And I'll tell you what, I used to spend a lot of time up at the University of Wisconsin in Madison back in the 60s and the 70s and it was a great school back then and they had constant demonstrations about what was going on against the war and pro-environmentalism and now you go to the old hot spots, Berkeley, Madison, University of Michigan, University of Texas and there are a
[02:01:25.083 --> 02:01:26.465]  Well, they've got free speech zones.
[02:01:26.505 --> 02:01:28.447]  They won't let you leaflet.
[02:01:29.027 --> 02:01:35.634]  It's a bunch of dumbed-down, scared, apathetic, detached kids.
[02:01:36.075 --> 02:01:44.684]  And I'll tell you what, if our young people are not demonstrating in the streets about what is going on right now, something is very wrong.
[02:01:44.684 --> 02:01:46.325]  In fact, when we get back, I want to talk about the draft.
[02:01:46.345 --> 02:01:47.887]  I talked about this yesterday, but this is central.
[02:01:47.907 --> 02:01:54.413]  They're really getting ready for it right now, and we've got to then push back and make sure they don't try to implement it after the next terror attack.
[02:01:54.633 --> 02:01:56.835]  Briefly, in 30 seconds, what else are they doing to you?
[02:01:56.855 --> 02:01:59.057]  I mean, they're saying... What are they saying you can't do?
[02:01:59.077 --> 02:02:05.142]  Well, they're saying that my presence constitutes an intimidation and aggressive act, so therefore I am banished.
[02:02:05.322 --> 02:02:11.768]  But if I were a currently enrolled student, well, personally, I have better things to do with my money right now during this crisis, but...
[02:02:12.148 --> 02:02:17.293]  They're saying because... Last month, two major federal lawsuits were lost.
[02:02:17.433 --> 02:02:22.017]  One in Arkansas for them not letting a preacher come on and preach in the squares.
[02:02:22.377 --> 02:02:23.638]  So you need to sue them, sir.
[02:02:24.339 --> 02:02:25.059]  You've got a case.
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:26.321]  You're going to win a bunch of money.
[02:02:26.561 --> 02:02:27.482]  Get the same lawyer.
[02:02:27.522 --> 02:02:31.125]  Just Google University of Arkansas loses case to preacher.
[02:02:31.765 --> 02:02:32.486]  We're free speech.
[02:02:32.526 --> 02:02:33.546]  Get that same lawyer.
[02:02:33.867 --> 02:02:36.068]  Sue him immediately and punish him.
[02:02:36.088 --> 02:02:37.669]  You've got to enforce this against them.
[02:02:37.929 --> 02:02:38.630]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:39.991]  They cannot do that.
[02:02:40.251 --> 02:02:41.852]  And if they try to do it to me, I'll sue.
[02:02:42.072 --> 02:02:42.773]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:42.793 --> 02:02:43.153]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.670 --> 02:02:51.851]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.211 --> 02:02:54.131]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.491 --> 02:03:02.153]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.833 --> 02:03:09.874]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.275 --> 02:03:13.255]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.555 --> 02:03:15.916]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.356 --> 02:03:16.836]  NSA spies.
[02:03:17.745 --> 02:03:21.068]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv

[02:04:06.684 --> 02:04:13.367]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:04:13.408 --> 02:04:15.729]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:05:51.191 --> 02:05:52.272]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.973 --> 02:05:54.094]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.734 --> 02:05:55.555]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.295 --> 02:05:57.176]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.877 --> 02:06:01.679]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:06.103]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.090 --> 02:06:11.854]  1-800-259-9031 is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:06:11.894 --> 02:06:16.357]  We've now got about 51 minutes left in this live Wednesday, the 30th day of August, 2006 edition.
[02:06:16.377 --> 02:06:26.624]  We're going to get back into some of the new developments on 9-11 and the big fifth anniversary coming up in New York and demonstrations and exposés taking place in almost every major city in the country.
[02:06:26.685 --> 02:06:27.645]  Good job, 9-11.
[02:06:27.925 --> 02:06:28.866]  Truth out there.
[02:06:28.926 --> 02:06:30.207]  We're at the tip of the spear here.
[02:06:30.607 --> 02:06:33.309]  More on the upcoming attempted war with Iran.
[02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:36.492]  Israel's saying they're getting ready for war, appointing their top general.
[02:06:37.172 --> 02:06:40.054]  We're going to talk about all of them.
[02:06:40.094 --> 02:06:43.016]  Right now, I want to go quickly through your phone calls.
[02:06:43.356 --> 02:06:45.237]  Dino in Oregon, you're on the air.
[02:06:45.318 --> 02:06:45.658]  Welcome.
[02:06:47.339 --> 02:06:47.999]  Go ahead, Dino.
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:49.240]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:49.680]  How are you?
[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:50.081]  Good, sir.
[02:06:50.101 --> 02:06:50.441]  Go ahead.
[02:06:51.121 --> 02:06:51.341]  Good.
[02:06:51.762 --> 02:06:56.345]  Listen, you know, I just wanted to let you know that waking up is a slow process and a different process for all of us.
[02:06:57.085 --> 02:07:00.647]  And we have to take these digestible chunks of information.
[02:07:00.707 --> 02:07:06.331]  And I know people like Mike Rupert were being used as a tool for the peak oil scam and
[02:07:06.738 --> 02:07:10.799]  Which is just another tool of fear to scare us into running around.
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:14.060]  And I didn't realize that that's what it was.
[02:07:14.940 --> 02:07:17.341]  Did you know that Rupert has fled the country to Venezuela?
[02:07:17.861 --> 02:07:18.722]  Yeah, I knew that.
[02:07:19.362 --> 02:07:20.582]  Did you read his goodbye letter?
[02:07:20.602 --> 02:07:22.743]  I did read it, yes.
[02:07:22.783 --> 02:07:23.923]  It's a big diversion.
[02:07:23.983 --> 02:07:25.044]  I don't even really care.
[02:07:25.584 --> 02:07:36.407]  It's a diversion, but remember, he's a tool, because he says the same things as you do and everybody else, is that the New World Order is after us, and they are trying to restructure our country and take us as slaves.
[02:07:37.597 --> 02:07:40.859]  Well, you know, he may believe the Malthusian stuff he put out.
[02:07:40.899 --> 02:07:42.461]  He may believe the peak oil fraud.
[02:07:42.501 --> 02:07:49.225]  But we know from Dutch Royal Shell's own documents 11 years ago, they created the movement to create artificial scarcity.
[02:07:49.566 --> 02:07:51.627]  And let me get a comment on peak oil from George Humphreys.
[02:07:51.647 --> 02:07:51.947]  George?
[02:07:52.368 --> 02:07:55.810]  Well, this is an incredibly important discussion.
[02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:57.952]  There are three different points of view.
[02:07:58.472 --> 02:08:02.095]  There are those who believe in peak oil, and we could talk about that for an hour.
[02:08:02.455 --> 02:08:04.396]  Well, George, I'm interested in your view on the subject.
[02:08:30.902 --> 02:08:41.959]  My point of view is that I've just read the Austin Environmental Manual right here and I think that the real issue is whether if we...
[02:08:44.056 --> 02:08:48.119]  Yeah, is whether we should stay on a fossil fuel economy.
[02:08:48.199 --> 02:08:49.821]  Which he's globalist all about.
[02:08:49.921 --> 02:08:53.724]  And if we stay on a fossil fuel economy, we're dead.
[02:08:54.424 --> 02:08:55.805]  We are slaves.
[02:08:56.125 --> 02:09:00.869]  It is more addicting than heroin or cigarettes or alcohol or sex.
[02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:10.937]  And until we break free and move toward renewable and become self-sufficient, which we have the technology to do today...
[02:09:12.150 --> 02:09:17.714]  Which we can do right now that we are going to continue to be slaves on the slave plantation.
[02:09:17.894 --> 02:09:18.875]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:19.635 --> 02:09:20.916]  I appreciate that, Dino.
[02:09:21.636 --> 02:09:25.259]  Before we go back to other calls, let me just briefly comment on this.
[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:27.460]  I've done the research.
[02:09:27.961 --> 02:09:28.501]  I've looked at it.
[02:09:28.741 --> 02:09:38.508]  So, before I give you my view on peak oil in a nutshell, in the analysis, let me first state that fossil fuels are dirty.
[02:09:39.989 --> 02:09:41.310]  They are causing problems.
[02:09:42.074 --> 02:09:42.754]  We're good to go.
[02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:42.915]  I think?
[02:10:06.892 --> 02:10:13.819]  I'm always for decentralization and there really are amazing solar and wind turbine systems.
[02:10:14.499 --> 02:10:15.420]  We have these.
[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:23.468]  They are being artificially suppressed because that would break up this oligopoly, this cartel, this monopoly that we know as OPEC.
[02:10:25.715 --> 02:10:28.336]  Why do we have the phony left out pushing peak oil?
[02:10:28.617 --> 02:10:30.377]  Webster Tarpley will tell you it's a fraud.
[02:10:31.338 --> 02:10:32.819]  Greg Palast will tell you it's a fraud.
[02:10:32.839 --> 02:10:35.360]  BBC, they get attacked for telling you it's a fraud.
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:36.901]  Why do they tell you it's a fraud?
[02:10:36.941 --> 02:10:38.181]  Because they're telling you the truth.
[02:10:39.682 --> 02:10:42.263]  Now, I'm going to tell you something here on air right now.
[02:10:43.984 --> 02:10:48.106]  I don't get a dime from oil money, but my family does.
[02:10:48.987 --> 02:10:55.110]  And let me just say, George Bush's actions and the New World Order's actions have made my family a lot of money.
[02:10:56.019 --> 02:11:03.524]  Okay, so I'm going to tell you right now that I'm putting out information that if you acted on it would cost my family a lot of money.
[02:11:04.345 --> 02:11:11.570]  Because of the doubling in oil prices, they are drilling like mad in East Texas and they are striking gigantic gas wells, oil wells, you name it.
[02:11:12.271 --> 02:11:14.092]  In the past, those wells were capped out there.
[02:11:14.752 --> 02:11:16.834]  And the big Alaskan oil is still capped.
[02:11:17.494 --> 02:11:18.275]  Okay, so...
[02:11:19.389 --> 02:11:21.633]  They know the people are becoming aware of this.
[02:11:21.693 --> 02:11:23.817]  They have found record oil reserves in Russia.
[02:11:24.218 --> 02:11:28.827]  They have found record oil reserves all over Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, all the other stands.
[02:11:29.975 --> 02:11:31.575]  They are finding oil all over the Gulf.
[02:11:32.096 --> 02:11:33.396]  They have laid it off limits.
[02:11:33.776 --> 02:11:37.317]  There is enough oil to run this country for several hundred years in Alaska alone.
[02:11:37.377 --> 02:11:39.977]  Discovered, verified, confirmed.
[02:11:40.018 --> 02:11:44.559]  This is artificial scarcity, just like you do with the diamonds, with the beers, and the Oppenheimers.
[02:11:44.959 --> 02:11:46.459]  It's the same system.
[02:11:46.539 --> 02:11:50.420]  Peak oil is a scam.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:58.022]  In 1990, the main reason the globalists were mad at their stooge, Saddam Hussein, who attacked Iran under their orders, and they told, go ahead and invade Kuwait,
[02:11:58.644 --> 02:12:02.266]  Was because he was overproducing, attempting to pay off a $34 billion debt.
[02:12:02.526 --> 02:12:10.551]  He was trying to pay his debts to the different banks and the different cartels that had financed his war machine like BCCI.
[02:12:11.351 --> 02:12:15.694]  And OPEC was very mad that he was overproducing and had driven oil down to 90 cents a gallon.
[02:12:16.834 --> 02:12:20.917]  So we know, people say, well, if it's about oil, why are they underproducing now in Iraq?
[02:12:21.297 --> 02:12:26.880]  Because by not producing oil, by cutting it down by 80%, that jacks up the price, which has now happened.
[02:12:27.415 --> 02:12:31.977]  So when BP turns off their pipelines in Alaska, they make more money.
[02:12:32.337 --> 02:12:32.577]  Okay?
[02:12:32.597 --> 02:12:36.359]  It's something like $20 million extra a day or something just off that pipeline they're making.
[02:12:36.699 --> 02:12:37.459]  I mean, add that up.
[02:12:37.999 --> 02:12:39.300]  So that's what's going on.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.820]  Peak oil is a fraud.
[02:12:41.041 --> 02:12:41.621]  I've looked at it.
[02:12:41.941 --> 02:12:42.481]  I've studied it.
[02:12:42.801 --> 02:12:44.502]  And if you want to believe in it, fine, go ahead.
[02:12:45.022 --> 02:12:47.943]  And I've got a bunch of cousins and uncles and people that are going to make a bunch of money.
[02:12:48.403 --> 02:12:48.744]  Okay?
[02:12:49.684 --> 02:12:50.964]  And I mean, fine if they make it.
[02:12:51.065 --> 02:12:52.425]  If you want to believe the fraud, go ahead.
[02:12:52.745 --> 02:12:53.966]  George, you want to comment on my statements?
[02:12:54.166 --> 02:12:57.167]  Well, you know, this discussion is an incredible...
[02:12:57.347 --> 02:12:58.208]  We're good to go.
[02:12:58.268 --> 02:12:58.929]  We're good to go.
[02:13:18.122 --> 02:13:21.645]  The environment of this planet is going to continue to deteriorate.
[02:13:21.685 --> 02:13:26.908]  Yeah, that's why the left has embraced this, because the grassroots left, because they know there's better energies.
[02:13:27.209 --> 02:13:31.151]  So if we can just say all the oil is going away, maybe we can move away from the oil cartels.
[02:13:31.371 --> 02:13:39.097]  But what I'm saying, George, is have you seen the 95-96 released in 2001 through lawsuits, hundreds of pages of ExxonMobil?
[02:13:39.937 --> 02:13:47.000]  Yeah, and so, first of all, I really applaud you for having this discussion because you're going against the politically correct, even for the patriotic movement, the point of view.
[02:14:03.326 --> 02:14:05.727]  And I don't have a horse in this race like you.
[02:14:05.827 --> 02:14:06.947]  I've made money from oil.
[02:14:07.788 --> 02:14:10.268]  I've invested in oil stocks and made some money from it.
[02:14:10.588 --> 02:14:13.629]  And that was money in my pocket.
[02:14:13.689 --> 02:14:17.230]  But the point is, what is best for our country?
[02:14:17.311 --> 02:14:18.591]  What's best for our world?
[02:14:18.931 --> 02:14:19.412]  We're good to go.
[02:14:36.770 --> 02:14:38.632]  Yeah.
[02:14:38.812 --> 02:14:41.194]  So that's where it stands, folks.
[02:14:41.654 --> 02:14:51.562]  I'm seriously looking at trying to get a smaller house somewhere outside Austin and literally having a little house built, solar, well, everything.
[02:14:51.582 --> 02:14:59.929]  And we see them moving with the Animal ID Act to block that, trying to meter wells, trying to block new wells, trying to claim you can't use the water on your own land to have a garden.
[02:15:00.270 --> 02:15:01.331]  I mean, that's what I'd like to do.
[02:15:01.471 --> 02:15:02.792]  I'm not into possessions, folks.
[02:15:03.553 --> 02:15:04.794]  I mean, I'm into self-sufficiency.
[02:15:04.874 --> 02:15:05.855]  I love being on the land.
[02:15:06.155 --> 02:15:07.937]  And they're doing everything they can to block that.
[02:15:08.057 --> 02:15:10.399]  But, regardless of that, it's exploding.
[02:15:10.419 --> 02:15:16.505]  The alternative energy movement, the self-sufficiency, true sustainability, not the byword of the globalists for neo-feudalism.
[02:15:16.725 --> 02:15:18.967]  See, they always counterfeit everything, don't they, George?
[02:15:19.227 --> 02:15:28.096]  Yeah, and to Alex's credit, just before we went into this, Alex has got the high-efficiency light bulbs in his office.
[02:15:28.397 --> 02:15:29.798]  He's very aware of this.
[02:15:29.838 --> 02:15:30.999]  He's doing his part.
[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:32.701]  George, don't tell people that.
[02:15:32.741 --> 02:15:34.283]  You see them in the sockets.
[02:15:34.563 --> 02:15:36.925]  Yeah, well, no, but it's... No, I'm a commie.
[02:15:37.406 --> 02:15:38.047]  A commie?
[02:15:38.207 --> 02:15:38.687]  I'm joking.
[02:15:40.368 --> 02:15:46.610]  But I'll tell you, it is so important is that fighting the New World Order is more than just getting mad.
[02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:58.994]  It's about taking care of our families, becoming more efficient, self-sufficient, by using less, by going to the mall less, by saving more money, by investing in gold and silver.
[02:15:59.034 --> 02:15:59.614]  Getting out of debt.
[02:15:59.794 --> 02:16:04.816]  Yes, getting out of debt, staying out of debt, and by staying healthy.
[02:16:05.556 --> 02:16:06.217]  Absolutely.
[02:16:06.557 --> 02:16:08.558]  Let's jam one more call in right now.
[02:16:08.918 --> 02:16:10.119]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:16:10.139 --> 02:16:11.019]  You're on the air, Chris.
[02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:12.740]  Chris just hung up.
[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:13.821]  Mark in Texas.
[02:16:13.841 --> 02:16:14.361]  You're on the air.
[02:16:14.381 --> 02:16:14.821]  Go ahead.
[02:16:16.762 --> 02:16:17.523]  Marla, go ahead.
[02:16:17.543 --> 02:16:17.583]  Hi.
[02:16:18.323 --> 02:16:19.384]  How are you doing, Ben?
[02:16:19.984 --> 02:16:26.668]  Yes, my question is about the economy, the New World Order, and the slave wages that Americans are being forced to put up with.
[02:16:26.768 --> 02:16:28.829]  It's only going to get worse with the illegal aliens, but go ahead.
[02:16:29.409 --> 02:16:34.092]  Yes, I just saw a documentary on PBS, and I've always heard about how Americans are working harder than ever.
[02:16:34.588 --> 02:16:39.290]  Not taking vacations, not spending time with their families, and they don't have anything to show for it.
[02:16:39.310 --> 02:16:41.792]  And I was wondering how the New World Order ties into all this.
[02:16:42.852 --> 02:16:44.253]  That's the official New World Order plan.
[02:16:44.393 --> 02:16:51.677]  Well, when I first got into politics, the first thing I learned was if you want to figure out where the... You know, you always follow the money.
[02:16:51.817 --> 02:16:52.577]  Follow the money.
[02:16:52.917 --> 02:16:56.979]  In The Wizard of Oz, the yellow brick road was the money trail.
[02:16:57.519 --> 02:17:02.102]  And having a degree in economics, and if you really go...
[02:17:02.942 --> 02:17:04.163]  Now they're debasing the currency.
[02:17:04.203 --> 02:17:06.145]  Does that answer your question?
[02:17:32.552 --> 02:17:33.312]  Thank you for the call.
[02:17:33.332 --> 02:17:37.135]  We'll come back and we'll talk to Douglas and many others.
[02:17:37.675 --> 02:17:37.975]  Allen, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:37.995 --> 02:17:38.055]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:45.805 --> 02:17:53.627]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:17:53.887 --> 02:17:55.487]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:17:55.727 --> 02:17:58.188]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:17:58.588 --> 02:18:13.151]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:18:13.191 --> 02:18:13.492]  government.
[02:18:13.692 --> 02:18:15.472]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:18:15.872 --> 02:18:21.775]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:18:21.895 --> 02:18:26.418]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:18:26.658 --> 02:18:33.381]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:33.441 --> 02:18:36.082]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:18:47.423 --> 02:18:51.105]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:52.306 --> 02:18:57.128]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:57.328 --> 02:19:01.230]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the US dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:02.571 --> 02:19:07.174]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:08.094 --> 02:19:15.298]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:19.741]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:21.561 --> 02:19:25.002]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:26.002 --> 02:19:27.262]  Call for your copy today.
[02:19:27.502 --> 02:19:29.722]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.783 --> 02:19:36.624]  If you've already accumulated or are planning to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:37.324 --> 02:19:37.604]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.624 --> 02:19:37.944]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.725 --> 02:19:48.187]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.667 --> 02:20:02.797]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism, but our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America, and one day we would wake up and have socialism-communism and not even know how it happened?
[02:20:03.596 --> 02:20:08.043]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[02:20:09.025 --> 02:20:14.073]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism-communism and don't even know it.
[02:20:14.254 --> 02:20:15.996]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said...
[02:20:16.667 --> 02:20:17.127]  Call now.
[02:20:17.187 --> 02:20:19.289]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:45.069 --> 02:20:51.512]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[02:20:51.752 --> 02:20:54.654]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[02:20:54.914 --> 02:20:58.776]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing these rights.
[02:20:59.036 --> 02:21:00.757]  Today, you can take this stand.
[02:21:01.097 --> 02:21:05.599]  Express your beliefs by wearing a new and innovative t-shirt available only through GCN.
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:11.282]  Each shirt is black, with a redesign of the famous Don't Tread on Me Gadsden flag located on the front of the shirt.
[02:21:11.562 --> 02:21:14.544]  On the back is the Bill of Rights, printed in bold white text.
[02:21:15.204 --> 02:21:22.188]  For additional information, including images of this shirt, please visit www.gcnlive.com today.
[02:21:55.162 --> 02:22:01.666]  There must be some kind of way out of here Said the joker to the thief
[02:22:12.693 --> 02:22:14.554]  There's too much confusion.
[02:22:14.574 --> 02:22:17.215]  I can't get no relief.
[02:22:17.255 --> 02:22:20.916]  Keep rolling it.
[02:22:21.236 --> 02:22:24.376]  Businessmen there drink my wine.
[02:22:25.557 --> 02:22:27.437]  Plowmen dig my earth.
[02:22:29.738 --> 02:22:32.919]  None will level on the mine.
[02:22:33.959 --> 02:22:35.939]  Nobody up in this world.
[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:36.960]  Hey!
[02:22:38.837 --> 02:22:42.500]  There are many among us who think that life is but a joke.
[02:22:52.617 --> 02:22:55.898]  It's amazing that very, very educated people, and we all have people like this in our lives.
[02:23:15.823 --> 02:23:15.883]  No.
[02:23:45.632 --> 02:23:47.072]  You won't even discuss this.
[02:23:48.053 --> 02:23:48.273]  No.
[02:23:48.553 --> 02:23:49.473]  And it's amazing.
[02:23:49.813 --> 02:23:55.015]  But the point is, we all have people like this, and we shouldn't waste our time with them.
[02:23:55.075 --> 02:23:55.895]  We love them.
[02:23:56.075 --> 02:23:58.696]  Yeah, there are many here among us that watch but a joke.
[02:23:58.776 --> 02:24:03.598]  And as Jesus said, don't cast pearls before a swine.
[02:24:03.638 --> 02:24:08.179]  We've got work to do, and our work is to be the Johnny Appleseeds, to be...
[02:24:09.048 --> 02:24:12.110]  Bringing this information to the people who will awaken.
[02:24:12.190 --> 02:24:17.453]  And as Alex said before, more and more and more and more people are waking up.
[02:24:17.813 --> 02:24:19.654]  Everybody knows that something is wrong.
[02:24:19.914 --> 02:24:20.975]  Everybody.
[02:24:21.355 --> 02:24:26.258]  Even the hardcore neocons know that something's wrong.
[02:24:26.558 --> 02:24:28.560]  And eventually, all of us woke up.
[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.801]  I believe the old paradigm at one time.
[02:24:31.221 --> 02:24:32.202]  And I've come through.
[02:24:32.362 --> 02:24:33.223]  Alex did.
[02:24:33.523 --> 02:24:34.404]  Many of you have.
[02:24:34.825 --> 02:24:37.267]  And our friends and our relatives can do that.
[02:24:37.387 --> 02:24:39.108]  We're going to talk more about Paradigm Shift coming up.
[02:24:39.689 --> 02:24:40.570]  Let's talk to Douglas.
[02:24:40.610 --> 02:24:41.851]  Douglas is calling us from Europe.
[02:24:41.871 --> 02:24:42.692]  Douglas, thanks for holding.
[02:24:42.712 --> 02:24:43.773]  Where are you calling from?
[02:24:43.793 --> 02:24:50.599]  I live around 30 kilometers south of Amsterdam.
[02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:54.663]  So you're calling us from the Netherlands or from Holland?
[02:24:54.823 --> 02:24:54.923]  Yeah.
[02:24:55.855 --> 02:25:03.738]  I'm in the middle of the tulip fields and I work at the Amsterdam airport.
[02:25:04.018 --> 02:25:05.198]  Well, good to have you on board with us.
[02:25:05.218 --> 02:25:05.858]  What's on your mind?
[02:25:07.399 --> 02:25:10.660]  You always talk too much, but I hope I can ask four questions.
[02:25:11.740 --> 02:25:16.662]  The first one is, how do you think World War III will be rolled out?
[02:25:16.762 --> 02:25:19.723]  Which countries will be involved and in what order?
[02:25:21.252 --> 02:25:23.933]  Let me write that down, because we'll probably go to break and then come back and get it.
[02:25:24.334 --> 02:25:27.655]  How will World War III be rolled out?
[02:25:27.695 --> 02:25:28.736]  What's the second question?
[02:25:29.776 --> 02:25:32.077]  Which countries will be involved and in what order?
[02:25:32.157 --> 02:25:33.418]  It's one question that I have.
[02:25:33.438 --> 02:25:34.018]  Okay.
[02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:40.601]  The other question that I have is the insurance companies that pay the 9-11 bill.
[02:25:41.182 --> 02:25:44.743]  Is there anything known about their research regarding 9-11?
[02:25:45.044 --> 02:25:47.445]  Okay, I can answer that question.
[02:25:47.485 --> 02:25:48.245]  That's a good question.
[02:25:49.246 --> 02:25:49.926]  What's the next one?
[02:25:50.666 --> 02:25:57.187]  Do you think that the neocons would go as far as to sacrifice George Bush in a new false flag event?
[02:25:59.748 --> 02:26:01.268]  Would they sacrifice Bush?
[02:26:01.388 --> 02:26:02.769]  Okay, that's a good question.
[02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:04.569]  These are all excellent, sir.
[02:26:04.609 --> 02:26:05.189]  What's the fourth?
[02:26:06.570 --> 02:26:12.211]  Is there a mainstream movie script about the real 9-11 on the shelves?
[02:26:12.651 --> 02:26:15.492]  Because you have your friends in Hollywood.
[02:26:16.112 --> 02:26:17.152]  Are they busy with a script?
[02:26:18.001 --> 02:26:20.163]  Well, I can't comment on that one.
[02:26:22.585 --> 02:26:24.607]  But those are all excellent questions.
[02:26:24.667 --> 02:26:26.368]  Any other comments or questions you've got?
[02:26:26.388 --> 02:26:30.672]  We're going to go to break, and we'll come back, and both of us will answer those excellent four questions.
[02:26:31.212 --> 02:26:32.673]  How will World War III roll out?
[02:26:32.693 --> 02:26:33.774]  What countries will be involved?
[02:26:34.375 --> 02:26:36.897]  And then insurance companies, are they investigating 9-11?
[02:26:37.477 --> 02:26:39.339]  And then the next question...
[02:26:40.406 --> 02:26:44.828]  Would they sacrifice Bush in some type of staged events?
[02:26:45.308 --> 02:26:48.749]  And then the Hollywood script question, which I've already kind of answered.
[02:26:48.789 --> 02:26:49.309]  Anything else?
[02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:52.571]  No, that's it for now.
[02:26:53.511 --> 02:26:54.571]  Well, good to have you on board.
[02:26:54.611 --> 02:26:55.472]  Call us back again.
[02:26:55.492 --> 02:26:56.732]  I forgot we had a foreign caller.
[02:26:56.752 --> 02:26:57.652]  I would have gone to you earlier.
[02:26:58.012 --> 02:27:01.014]  Thank you so much for the call, sir, Douglas.
[02:27:02.414 --> 02:27:05.275]  Okay, let me try to comment on the first one.
[02:27:05.295 --> 02:27:07.556]  We'll come back and let George comment on it.
[02:27:08.462 --> 02:27:11.445]  How will World War III be rolled out?
[02:27:13.086 --> 02:27:15.228]  Well, we see how they're setting the stage for it.
[02:27:15.248 --> 02:27:18.711]  They claim Iran hasn't complied with total U.N.
[02:27:18.751 --> 02:27:19.332]  occupation.
[02:27:20.313 --> 02:27:24.216]  And when we get back, we'll briefly get into how that will happen and try to answer the other ones.
[02:27:24.577 --> 02:27:25.337]  Excellent questions.
[02:27:26.438 --> 02:27:33.345]  And we'll take more calls in the broadcast getting into where George thinks things are going with the 9-11 truth movement and how we can get involved.
[02:27:33.365 --> 02:27:33.705]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.982 --> 02:27:36.864]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.365 --> 02:27:38.968]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:42.574]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.163 --> 02:27:48.823]  Hey, Bill.
[02:27:49.184 --> 02:27:50.264]  I'm buying lunch today.
[02:27:50.605 --> 02:27:51.405]  And check this out.
[02:27:51.726 --> 02:27:52.626]  I bought a new car.
[02:27:52.726 --> 02:27:53.367]  Wow, John.
[02:27:53.427 --> 02:27:57.951]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[02:27:58.511 --> 02:28:02.654]  www.DidYouRobBillGates.com I did, and you were right.
[02:28:02.975 --> 02:28:07.879]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:28:08.299 --> 02:28:10.761]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:28:11.061 --> 02:28:14.424]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[02:28:14.664 --> 02:28:15.545]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[02:28:15.885 --> 02:28:18.286]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[02:28:18.646 --> 02:28:20.888]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[02:28:21.008 --> 02:28:21.668]  It's incredible.
[02:28:22.048 --> 02:28:29.512]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[02:28:29.832 --> 02:28:34.774]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:35.375 --> 02:28:36.075]  Check, please.
[02:28:36.535 --> 02:28:37.416]  I got this one, Bill.
[02:28:37.816 --> 02:28:38.496]  Sure, John.
[02:28:38.656 --> 02:28:43.239]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:43.399 --> 02:28:43.639]  Deal.
[02:28:46.107 --> 02:28:51.074]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[02:28:51.394 --> 02:28:56.822]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.862 --> 02:29:01.148]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.488 --> 02:29:04.510]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.811 --> 02:29:08.253]  So effective you could drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.573 --> 02:29:17.941]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.201 --> 02:29:21.703]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:21.944 --> 02:29:29.029]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:29:29.289 --> 02:29:30.650]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[02:29:45.945 --> 02:29:48.447]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:29:48.547 --> 02:29:50.928]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:29:50.988 --> 02:29:57.172]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:29:58.652 --> 02:30:00.934]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:30:01.594 --> 02:30:05.136]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:30:05.696 --> 02:30:09.819]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:30:10.399 --> 02:30:13.341]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:30:14.341 --> 02:30:17.263]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:30:18.004 --> 02:30:23.989]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:24.249 --> 02:30:27.091]  That's 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:27.592 --> 02:30:31.915]  For the following two free reports, U.S.
[02:30:31.995 --> 02:30:34.898]  Debt Bubble, Red Alert, and Real Estate Crash.
[02:30:35.878 --> 02:30:38.160]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:42.404]  That's 888-8XANADU.
[02:30:42.764 --> 02:30:43.725]  And ask for George.
[02:30:48.425 --> 02:30:54.447]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.047 --> 02:30:58.068]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:59.289 --> 02:31:02.890]  Alright, let me just try to go through these points.
[02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:06.691]  We see how they're rolling it out, just like they rolled out the Iraq attack.
[02:31:07.031 --> 02:31:14.754]  They hype it up, they blame 9-11 on them, they claim they have WMDs, the White House Memo Show, how they were planning to lie to the public and how they did lie to the public.
[02:31:15.527 --> 02:31:21.431]  They now hype it up and claim that Iran isn't following UN orders, which is following world government orders.
[02:31:21.791 --> 02:31:24.192]  They did comply with that, which I don't think they should have.
[02:31:25.013 --> 02:31:27.414]  And now they're being told, okay, we'll comply to this, this, and that.
[02:31:27.434 --> 02:31:28.375]  And they're saying no.
[02:31:28.915 --> 02:31:31.376]  And so Israel's openly chastising the U.S.
[02:31:31.397 --> 02:31:36.820]  for not attacking them and saying they're going to go ahead and probably attack them here in the next few months to the next year.
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:38.361]  It could be any time in that frame.
[02:31:38.401 --> 02:31:39.021]  It could be tomorrow.
[02:31:39.041 --> 02:31:39.902]  It could be next month.
[02:31:40.662 --> 02:31:42.063]  And they'll go into Iran.
[02:31:42.859 --> 02:31:47.282]  They're saying they'll bomb over 200 sites with huge bunker-busting missiles.
[02:31:48.863 --> 02:31:56.729]  Then I believe the globalists will stage terror attacks in the West to blame it on Iran, or they could even stage the terror attacks before that, which is very probable.
[02:31:56.749 --> 02:31:57.709]  We've been talking about that.
[02:31:58.210 --> 02:32:01.772]  And then go into Iran, and Iran will then strike back.
[02:32:01.792 --> 02:32:06.696]  They said they're going to mine harbors and attack ships with surface-to-surface missiles.
[02:32:07.396 --> 02:32:16.942]  And it's extremely serious, and the globalists will make unbelievable profits as oil prices go up to, this is no exaggeration, considerably $300 a barrel.
[02:32:18.423 --> 02:32:21.705]  We're talking about an implosion of the economy, which will then all be blamed on Iran.
[02:32:22.065 --> 02:32:24.467]  They'll have a domestic draft, but they'll say it's not a draft.
[02:32:24.487 --> 02:32:27.729]  They'll call it a universal service, which they're now saying they're going to do.
[02:32:28.469 --> 02:32:31.171]  And then they'll probably at the same time start bombarding
[02:32:32.103 --> 02:32:33.304]  We're good to go.
[02:32:33.324 --> 02:32:33.525]  I think?
[02:32:54.787 --> 02:33:01.475]  And there'll be 60 other countries that are on the neocon hit list from the PNAC documents from September 2000 that they plan on invading.
[02:33:01.775 --> 02:33:04.718]  So false flag terror before or after the attack.
[02:33:04.819 --> 02:33:09.043]  Iran may even launch some rail attacks, which you really couldn't expect otherwise.
[02:33:09.664 --> 02:33:14.289]  They will be decried for defending themselves, and that's really what I see happening on the first question.
[02:33:14.329 --> 02:33:14.590]  George?
[02:33:16.030 --> 02:33:21.521]  Well, Alex, you have outlined a very, very possible scenario.
[02:33:22.683 --> 02:33:25.248]  First of all, everything is driven by money and power.
[02:33:25.288 --> 02:33:26.711]  We have an election coming up
[02:33:27.319 --> 02:33:28.320]  In two months from now.
[02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:33.163]  Clearly, the Republicans, the neocons, I think Bush's approval ratings are, what, 32%?
[02:33:33.303 --> 02:33:40.827]  It's the lowest approval rating, and it's the highest negatives that any president has had for 50, 60, 70 years.
[02:33:41.828 --> 02:33:47.532]  They clearly, clearly, clearly, there is going to be something that will happen in the next couple of months.
[02:33:47.592 --> 02:33:49.013]  Now, how far they will go.
[02:33:49.313 --> 02:33:54.556]  Now, a lot of people believe that what happened in southern Lebanon, which took place
[02:33:54.996 --> 02:33:55.657]  We don't believe.
[02:33:56.657 --> 02:33:58.338]  Cy Hersh got the documents, so did the British.
[02:33:58.638 --> 02:34:03.561]  Bush considered it a curtain raiser to start the war, but that was a trial below.
[02:34:04.162 --> 02:34:09.024]  And it just happened that Bush was meeting with Putin right at the time that this happened.
[02:34:09.084 --> 02:34:16.749]  And from what I understand, he went to Putin and he said, look, if you support us in the invasion of Iran, you get access in the World Trade Organization.
[02:34:17.249 --> 02:34:22.072]  And if this is true, Putin, to his credit, said, you know, go take a hike.
[02:34:22.552 --> 02:34:28.156]  Now, what they want, Russia is still the wild card out there.
[02:34:28.677 --> 02:34:34.401]  And Putin has always been torn by the Rothschild organization.
[02:34:34.501 --> 02:34:35.662]  It's the joker.
[02:34:35.682 --> 02:34:36.803]  And the nationalists.
[02:34:37.243 --> 02:34:42.868]  But as the proof of that, they arrested the head of Yukos Oil two years ago, and it came out in the Times of London.
[02:34:42.908 --> 02:34:43.068]  Right.
[02:34:43.188 --> 02:34:44.748]  That, oh, you still don't own it.
[02:34:44.788 --> 02:34:47.809]  Lord Rothschild, the head of Yukos, was just his front.
[02:34:48.209 --> 02:34:48.409]  Right.
[02:34:49.149 --> 02:34:59.412]  But it appears as though the Nationalists have some dominance right now in Russia, and they're saying, hey, whoa, we are not going to play this game.
[02:34:59.472 --> 02:35:09.174]  Now, whether in fact this is the truth or not, but apparently the Nationalists in Russia do not want to be playing with the Rothschild New World Order crowd.
[02:35:09.654 --> 02:35:12.878]  And so they're saying no to this invasion of Iran.
[02:35:13.279 --> 02:35:18.104]  And so clearly right now between... And I go to Asia all the time.
[02:35:18.425 --> 02:35:24.592]  People have no idea of the ascendancy of what's going on in India and China right now.
[02:35:25.052 --> 02:35:25.612]  We're good to go.
[02:35:25.652 --> 02:35:26.292]  We're good to go.
[02:35:55.221 --> 02:36:00.804]  And if they push this too far, there are multiple scenarios.
[02:36:00.844 --> 02:36:05.726]  And what you've just talked about is a very, very real scenario.
[02:36:05.746 --> 02:36:07.987]  Well, that's the scenario they're saying they plan to carry out.
[02:36:08.007 --> 02:36:13.850]  But you're right, just a moderate escalation could do that and get them what they want in the election and continue their agenda.
[02:36:14.250 --> 02:36:16.671]  The insurance companies, I know the big German insurer...
[02:36:17.871 --> 02:36:33.975]  Of Building 7, because he took out a bunch of different insurance policies, and policies that big, it's kind of an index or a grouping of different companies that fund the $6.5 billion of insurance that Silverstein's got and was based on.
[02:36:34.335 --> 02:36:40.016]  They did hear testimony from people on Building 7, but the insurance companies are the banks, are the military industrial complex.
[02:36:40.356 --> 02:36:42.157]  Well, you're an expert on insurance companies.
[02:36:42.177 --> 02:36:42.878]  Tell us about it, George.
[02:36:50.773 --> 02:36:59.081]  The amazing thing is Larry Silverstein got the lease for the World Trade Centers months before 9-11.
[02:37:00.302 --> 02:37:07.890]  He put $15 million down of the supposed $100 million down to have a 99-year lease.
[02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:15.277]  He then changed the insurance policies to include terror strikes,
[02:37:17.122 --> 02:37:20.485]  And then he has gotten not one, but a double dose.
[02:37:20.525 --> 02:37:23.528]  He was supposed to get $3.5 billion.
[02:37:23.569 --> 02:37:25.891]  He got $7.1 billion.
[02:37:26.051 --> 02:37:27.693]  Last time I heard, though, he'd only collected $6.5.
[02:37:27.733 --> 02:37:33.038]  So I guess he did get the final... From what I understand, he's gotten $7.1 billion.
[02:37:33.118 --> 02:37:33.238]  Now...
[02:37:35.420 --> 02:37:38.622]  He has invested between $15 to $100 billion.
[02:37:38.662 --> 02:37:39.682]  Now, we don't know.
[02:37:39.942 --> 02:37:41.443]  Let's say it's $50 million.
[02:37:41.943 --> 02:37:53.309]  The return on his investment, plus the fact that now he is doing urban renewal for the whole part of southern Manhattan.
[02:37:53.609 --> 02:37:55.230]  This guy is unbelievable.
[02:37:56.151 --> 02:37:57.812]  He also just leashed the Sears Coward.
[02:37:57.952 --> 02:38:03.515]  Yes, and we have his hand, not his hand, but his whole arm in the cookie jar.
[02:38:03.795 --> 02:38:09.279]  He has admitted that he is the one who took down World Trade Center No.
[02:38:09.299 --> 02:38:09.279]  7.
[02:38:09.759 --> 02:38:11.520]  Now, folks, it can't be more obvious.
[02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:12.461]  It shouldn't in plain view.
[02:38:12.481 --> 02:38:14.382]  You know, key bono, who benefited?
[02:38:14.602 --> 02:38:18.463]  Now, the other question is, would the globalists take out Bush in some stage of it?
[02:38:18.503 --> 02:38:26.785]  I don't see that happening, but they'll do anything, and we certainly hope nothing happens to the puppet because they get a lot of gas mileage out of that.
[02:38:26.805 --> 02:38:32.866]  And we hope that, you know, we certainly don't want Cheney there.
[02:38:33.146 --> 02:38:36.807]  But remember what his nickname is at the Bilderberg.
[02:38:37.568 --> 02:38:38.328]  Temporary.
[02:38:38.848 --> 02:38:40.448]  They changed it to temporary.
[02:38:41.008 --> 02:38:43.629]  And I'll tell you what, there are some other Bushes down the line
[02:38:44.096 --> 02:38:49.538]  Jeb, who's a heck of a lot smarter, and he's also in the line for ascendancy.
[02:38:49.799 --> 02:38:52.740]  Yeah, he's one of the neocons writing up the PNAC document.
[02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:54.040]  He's actually got a brain up there.
[02:38:54.661 --> 02:38:56.562]  Why do you think they put George in?
[02:38:56.582 --> 02:39:03.064]  When he was governor, he wasn't that stupid and bumbling like he's retarded and got Parkinson's now.
[02:39:03.425 --> 02:39:05.005]  I mean, what's happened to Bush?
[02:39:05.045 --> 02:39:08.907]  Because he's getting worse and worse and more just embarrassing.
[02:39:09.827 --> 02:39:10.988]  I just think that this...
[02:39:11.619 --> 02:39:14.481]  Well, first of all, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed.
[02:39:14.501 --> 02:39:19.485]  And I have a lot of dear friends who are very, very close friends with him.
[02:39:20.386 --> 02:39:22.947]  I've been to Laura's house.
[02:39:23.288 --> 02:39:24.749]  I know people who know him.
[02:39:25.289 --> 02:39:30.413]  He's a nice, at least on one level, he used to be a pretty nice guy on a personal level.
[02:39:30.733 --> 02:39:34.276]  But clearly, he is in water so much deeper than he understands.
[02:39:34.356 --> 02:39:36.678]  Yeah, you've met and been at events with Lord Bush.
[02:39:36.738 --> 02:39:39.119]  So have I. What's he like as a person?
[02:39:39.359 --> 02:39:39.900]  Well, on a
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:44.001]  On a personal level, he's a good old boy.
[02:39:44.081 --> 02:39:49.142]  He's not somebody you'd want to do business with if you had to really invest your money.
[02:39:49.522 --> 02:39:53.103]  He's kind of a good old boy, not very bright.
[02:39:53.183 --> 02:39:55.104]  And he's very ambitious.
[02:39:55.144 --> 02:39:59.785]  I remember when he used to own Texas Rangers, and that was before he was even running for governor.
[02:40:00.085 --> 02:40:06.126]  People would come up to him, and before they'd even introduce himself, he'd pull out a picture of himself and start signing it.
[02:40:06.206 --> 02:40:08.147]  So he's kind of a...
[02:40:09.927 --> 02:40:10.448]  Frat boy.
[02:40:10.508 --> 02:40:11.869]  He's kind of a frat boy.
[02:40:12.250 --> 02:40:16.234]  Remember, he had a low C average at Yale.
[02:40:16.714 --> 02:40:17.996]  He was a cheerleader.
[02:40:18.476 --> 02:40:20.638]  He was a drunk.
[02:40:20.939 --> 02:40:22.600]  I mean, he was just a drunk.
[02:40:23.521 --> 02:40:28.927]  He's been pulled over for DUI on at least one and probably three or four occasions.
[02:40:29.307 --> 02:40:29.848]  We're good to go.
[02:40:29.908 --> 02:40:30.929]  We're good to go.
[02:40:47.794 --> 02:40:50.216]  I wonder if they know how dangerous it is to be shooting their mouths off.
[02:40:50.356 --> 02:40:53.138]  Well, I mean, this is fairly common knowledge.
[02:40:53.198 --> 02:40:59.043]  This is old information, but the point is that he was a useful idiot.
[02:40:59.403 --> 02:41:07.450]  You know, he is the person that could go to the churches and say that he was a good Christian, and people in the Midwest believe that.
[02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:10.813]  He's been very... Skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, that's very Christian.
[02:41:10.853 --> 02:41:11.093]  Yes.
[02:41:11.173 --> 02:41:12.654]  What about the spiritual nature of all this?
[02:41:12.674 --> 02:41:13.455]  Then we're going to take some calls.
[02:41:13.935 --> 02:41:24.878]  Well, clearly is that George Bush and his band of pirates represent the most materialistic, secular, atheistic vibration on this planet.
[02:41:24.918 --> 02:41:31.880]  They're like vampires, and they don't believe in the consciousness of man, of the eternal spirit.
[02:41:32.380 --> 02:41:36.001]  And I believe that there's infinite energy and love for all human beings.
[02:41:36.361 --> 02:41:43.152]  These people believe that it's every man for themselves and that they have to steal the energy just like a vampire has to steal energy.
[02:41:43.172 --> 02:41:44.515]  It's a satanic motto.
[02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:45.797]  Do as thou wilt.
[02:41:45.837 --> 02:41:46.898]  That is the whole of the law.
[02:41:47.079 --> 02:41:47.339]  Yeah.
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:48.241]  And it's, you know...
[02:41:49.185 --> 02:41:52.968]  It's whoever has the power instead of whoever has the love and the integrity.
[02:41:53.008 --> 02:41:57.811]  And the point is that this man is the most amazing paradox.
[02:41:57.851 --> 02:42:01.734]  But everybody knows that he is only the puppet.
[02:42:01.834 --> 02:42:05.376]  It is the people behind him who are pulling the strings.
[02:42:05.416 --> 02:42:09.799]  So I don't think that we should get too fixated on George W. Bush himself.
[02:42:10.019 --> 02:42:10.620]  Absolutely.
[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:12.041]  There's your question, sir.
[02:42:12.061 --> 02:42:13.381]  We've got to move quick here now.
[02:42:13.762 --> 02:42:15.423]  Who's up next in Ontario?
[02:42:16.383 --> 02:42:17.324]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[02:42:17.364 --> 02:42:17.684]  Welcome.
[02:42:18.084 --> 02:42:18.484]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:18.544 --> 02:42:19.225]  It's a great honor.
[02:42:19.245 --> 02:42:20.785]  Honored to talk to you.
[02:42:20.825 --> 02:42:22.026]  What's on your mind?
[02:42:22.086 --> 02:42:22.726]  Psychology.
[02:42:22.767 --> 02:42:25.928]  It's really interesting what George has been talking about, the paradigm shift.
[02:42:25.988 --> 02:42:43.938]  I had a recent experience where I was talking to somebody who actually goes to BYU, and he was, you know, calling me names and saying that everyone here, and he was there and heard all the, you know, the professors and everybody calling the guy basically a moron, 99% of people, and everybody knows he's, you know, totally incompetent and, you know...
[02:42:44.594 --> 02:42:46.615]  You're talking about Stephen Jones.
[02:42:46.675 --> 02:42:49.577]  Yeah, he was talking about Stephen Jones and how about everybody there.
[02:42:49.597 --> 02:42:52.879]  And he's actually studying engineering there and how he's a complete moron.
[02:42:52.959 --> 02:42:55.620]  And, you know, I basically, I didn't react.
[02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:02.604]  I basically, my idea is kind of like if I just, if I'm positive, raise my vibration, you know, I can actually, I've gotten through to people.
[02:43:02.684 --> 02:43:06.206]  One guy, he's well-known in Hollywood, and he's making fun of loose change.
[02:43:06.266 --> 02:43:09.127]  And I was like, well, did you go look at Operation Northwood?
[02:43:09.187 --> 02:43:11.309]  And, yeah, I got him to watch Terror Storm.
[02:43:11.389 --> 02:43:12.349]  I kept harping on him.
[02:43:12.869 --> 02:43:13.830]  And he's like, wow.
[02:43:14.847 --> 02:43:17.989]  You know, he really said, pull it, and he's totally had this paradigm shift.
[02:43:18.109 --> 02:43:24.292]  And, you know, so if you just keep on harping on some of these people and just say, no, did you actually read the documents?
[02:43:24.392 --> 02:43:35.797]  And, you know, not kind of do that kind of classic thing where they expect you to run and they expect you to, you know, back down when they bring up their cold, hard facts, and I won't be able to handle them.
[02:43:35.837 --> 02:43:36.798]  Well, you know, I'm the guy.
[02:43:37.238 --> 02:43:41.620]  Go look on CIA.gov Operation Ajax, and, you know, they're just kind of, whoa, you know.
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.401]  You can actually, like, I'm in Canada.
[02:43:44.321 --> 02:43:55.388]  And I tell people, you know, like, hey, if they do this martial law, blow up martial law, and they blow up a nuke, and it's martial law in the United States, it could be martial law in Canada, too.
[02:43:55.428 --> 02:43:55.749]  I don't know.
[02:43:56.069 --> 02:43:56.409]  Are you there?
[02:43:57.630 --> 02:43:57.930]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:57.950 --> 02:43:58.690]  We're listening to you.
[02:43:58.831 --> 02:43:59.391]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:59.451 --> 02:44:06.936]  And that's what I tell people, and then they might go, oh, my God, like, you know, and not some, like, you know, like, oh, you know, you just tell somebody the government's behind 9-11, and they're
[02:44:07.663 --> 02:44:08.824]  Oh yeah, you wacko, you know.
[02:44:08.844 --> 02:44:13.208]  Well good, listen, one soul at a time, one mind at a time, one intellect at a time.
[02:44:13.709 --> 02:44:14.149]  Keep it up.
[02:44:14.189 --> 02:44:14.649]  Anything else?
[02:44:14.669 --> 02:44:25.019]  Yeah, I just want to talk about, what do you think more, like, I'm in this kind of law of attraction, you get what you think in life, you know, and I hear when I talk to some of those crowd about this New World Order stuff, they go,
[02:44:25.663 --> 02:44:30.047]  Well, you don't want to create more of that by just focusing on all the negativity.
[02:44:30.067 --> 02:44:32.189]  Well, no, we're not focusing on negativity.
[02:44:32.209 --> 02:44:35.852]  We're exposing the bad and telling people there's a problem.
[02:44:35.892 --> 02:44:38.153]  I appreciate... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:44:38.414 --> 02:44:39.415]  I'm sorry, I was agreeing with you.
[02:44:39.435 --> 02:44:40.455]  That's exactly what I mean, too.
[02:44:40.596 --> 02:44:41.536]  Well, listen, thanks for the call.
[02:44:41.556 --> 02:44:42.197]  Good to hear from you.
[02:44:43.698 --> 02:44:45.420]  Damon in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:45.780]  Welcome.
[02:44:47.681 --> 02:44:48.202]  Go ahead, Damon.
[02:44:48.567 --> 02:44:48.927]  Hey, buddy.
[02:44:49.148 --> 02:44:51.691]  I wanted to start by saying I met you in Dallas.
[02:44:52.171 --> 02:44:53.413]  Oh, thanks for coming out to the event.
[02:44:53.573 --> 02:44:57.057]  I was at the top of the stairs talking about Bohemian Girl just to put a reference on it.
[02:44:57.077 --> 02:45:04.746]  I just wanted to start by saying, how are we going to get this older generation and people like my dad to wake up?
[02:45:06.016 --> 02:45:09.659]  Well, you've got a lot of people that judge the world through their own eyes and their own minds.
[02:45:09.679 --> 02:45:13.041]  So if your dad's a good guy, he can't imagine there's corrupt people in the government.
[02:45:13.061 --> 02:45:13.522]  They're naive.
[02:45:13.542 --> 02:45:15.303]  It's like women who get in a car with serial killers.
[02:45:15.663 --> 02:45:17.504]  They can't believe it's actually happening to them.
[02:45:18.185 --> 02:45:21.667]  George Humphries, you want to comment on how you reach out to the older generation?
[02:45:22.067 --> 02:45:26.050]  Well, the last fellow talked about the power of attraction.
[02:45:26.190 --> 02:45:31.173]  And what we have to do is that the first thing is that we have to change our own hearts and minds.
[02:45:31.234 --> 02:45:31.674]  We have to...
[02:45:32.174 --> 02:45:34.837]  First get the information, the objective information.
[02:45:34.857 --> 02:45:36.158]  First you have to have the facts.
[02:45:36.198 --> 02:45:39.561]  A lot of people are insecure when they go up to somebody and that resonates.
[02:45:39.601 --> 02:45:42.844]  No, you're here, you've got a mission, you're doing them a favor.
[02:45:42.904 --> 02:45:43.505]  Have that attitude.
[02:45:43.545 --> 02:45:43.945]  Sorry, George.
[02:45:44.185 --> 02:45:46.908]  And if you've got the facts, that will resonate.
[02:45:47.568 --> 02:45:53.454]  And if you can look somebody in the eye and say, why was the hole in the Pentagon 18 feet by 21 and a boring 757 is 155 feet wide?
[02:45:56.076 --> 02:45:56.557]  We're good to go.
[02:46:20.595 --> 02:46:25.045]  By factual information and by changing it with love is what's important.
[02:46:25.186 --> 02:46:26.148]  Caller, are you there?
[02:46:26.168 --> 02:46:26.949]  Do you have your radio up?
[02:46:28.079 --> 02:46:28.279]  Alex?
[02:46:28.719 --> 02:46:29.419]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:46:29.719 --> 02:46:37.541]  Yeah, I just wanted to, my office phone is ringing, but I just wanted to, one thing that keeps me going is I keep repeating, fear not the path of truth, but the people walking on it.
[02:46:37.982 --> 02:46:39.822]  And we're all human and we're all freedom fighters.
[02:46:39.882 --> 02:46:40.642]  Keep up the good work.
[02:46:40.782 --> 02:46:41.742]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[02:46:42.143 --> 02:46:43.143]  George, you want to show what you were saying?
[02:46:43.323 --> 02:46:51.505]  Yeah, and the bottom line is, this thing is so, so much bigger than the Federal Reserve or TWA Flight 800.
[02:46:52.045 --> 02:46:57.756]  It's about evil people that think they have a right to feed on whoever they want and are greedy and hateful of us even having good lives.
[02:46:58.077 --> 02:46:59.700]  They don't even want us to be free or happy.
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:00.261]  They hate that.
[02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:04.652]  And they are living in the old paradigm.
[02:47:04.932 --> 02:47:09.835]  And if we truly believe in the Creator, the Creator is love.
[02:47:10.315 --> 02:47:16.399]  And so we have to break through and not judge them, but not put up with their BS either.
[02:47:16.439 --> 02:47:18.980]  We have to be bold and strong.
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:19.501]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:47:19.521 --> 02:47:22.002]  I mean, George is really able to sell people on the truth.
[02:47:22.122 --> 02:47:24.103]  I'm able because we're confident.
[02:47:24.644 --> 02:47:25.464]  And we have the facts.
[02:47:25.504 --> 02:47:26.705]  You're confident because you have the facts.
[02:47:26.725 --> 02:47:27.926]  You're confident because you're doing good work.
[02:47:27.966 --> 02:47:28.366]  Right, George?
[02:47:29.206 --> 02:47:30.027]  We're doing our best.
[02:47:30.797 --> 02:47:34.159]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Florida.
[02:47:34.179 --> 02:47:34.899]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:36.680]  Well, you're right.
[02:47:36.740 --> 02:47:40.702]  Their greatest strategy is to separate us from love and separate us from God.
[02:47:41.523 --> 02:47:46.425]  But I just wanted to go through some strategies that I've used to call in some talk shows.
[02:47:47.346 --> 02:47:51.568]  And it's easy to get through a lot of these talk shows because their ratings really stink.
[02:47:51.648 --> 02:47:59.132]  And usually you can get through, be the first caller, even when you tell them exactly what you're going to talk about, they're sometimes all too willing to take your call.
[02:47:59.921 --> 02:48:05.927]  Because I think some of them are also really alarmed about what's going on, that they want to hear from the other side.
[02:48:07.188 --> 02:48:21.021]  Some talk show hosts try to give an excuse for not having you on, saying that you're an extremist or you just like to sell documentaries, in which case those hosts need to be told that you can go to Google Video or YouTube.
[02:48:22.001 --> 02:48:23.343]  Well, why is it okay for...
[02:48:24.145 --> 02:48:27.389]  David Rockefeller to sell a book, and then George or I can.
[02:48:27.409 --> 02:48:29.411]  Number one, that argument's a fraud.
[02:48:29.791 --> 02:48:33.235]  I can make an official video about how the government's telling us the truth.
[02:48:33.275 --> 02:48:35.918]  They have it on every TV show, and I'd sell 10 million copies.
[02:48:36.518 --> 02:48:38.040]  We're making sacrifices to do this.
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:39.401]  But yeah, stay there.
[02:48:39.421 --> 02:48:40.803]  I'll let you finish up with some of your strategies.
[02:48:41.243 --> 02:48:43.105]  Then we'll talk to Shane, and that'll be it.
[02:48:43.405 --> 02:48:44.667]  This show is going to be over.
[02:48:44.727 --> 02:48:45.107]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.147 --> 02:48:45.828]  Final segment coming up.
[02:48:48.974 --> 02:48:52.175]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.515 --> 02:48:54.415]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.815 --> 02:49:02.477]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.157 --> 02:49:10.198]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.599 --> 02:49:13.539]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.919 --> 02:49:16.240]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.660 --> 02:49:17.500]  NSA spies.
[02:49:17.972 --> 02:49:22.055]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.335 --> 02:49:25.838]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.318 --> 02:49:28.219]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.559 --> 02:49:32.482]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.757 --> 02:49:46.518]  Terrorism.
[02:49:46.678 --> 02:49:47.418]  Terrorism.
[02:49:47.518 --> 02:49:48.359]  Chemical attacks.
[02:49:48.439 --> 02:49:49.100]  Dirty bombs.
[02:49:49.180 --> 02:49:49.600]  Fallout.
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:50.681]  Biological attack.
[02:49:50.861 --> 02:49:51.401]  Anthrax.
[02:49:51.461 --> 02:49:53.583]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:49:53.843 --> 02:49:55.445]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:49:55.685 --> 02:49:58.147]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:49:58.547 --> 02:50:13.118]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:13.158 --> 02:50:13.478]  government.
[02:50:13.659 --> 02:50:15.440]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:21.723]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:21.863 --> 02:50:26.365]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:50:26.625 --> 02:50:33.348]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:33.408 --> 02:50:36.029]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:50:46.880 --> 02:50:52.809]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[02:51:02.162 --> 02:51:02.823]  We're good to go.
[02:51:31.681 --> 02:51:34.782]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.942 --> 02:51:40.804]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:54.988 --> 02:51:59.691]  George Humphries, before we run out of time, I want to thank you for being here, my friend.
[02:52:00.171 --> 02:52:01.052]  I really appreciate it.
[02:52:01.612 --> 02:52:03.033]  We've got about three minutes left.
[02:52:03.093 --> 02:52:04.934]  Any final comments or statements you want to make?
[02:52:05.842 --> 02:52:09.084]  Five-year anniversary of 9-11 is coming up right now.
[02:52:09.284 --> 02:52:18.268]  It is the segue for all patriots, all awake human beings to pound and pound and pound on the truth.
[02:52:18.708 --> 02:52:22.149]  Why was there such a small hole at the Pentagon?
[02:52:22.189 --> 02:52:24.370]  Why was there no wreckage at Shanksville?
[02:52:24.591 --> 02:52:25.451]  How did the buildings...
[02:52:26.391 --> 02:52:29.734]  WTC come down in 8.4 seconds.
[02:52:29.754 --> 02:52:31.155]  How did the foundation melt?
[02:52:31.455 --> 02:52:34.217]  Why were public officials warned not to fly?
[02:52:34.257 --> 02:52:35.518]  CIA insider trading.
[02:52:35.578 --> 02:52:40.621]  Dozens and dozens of factual, objective, provable pieces of information.
[02:52:41.142 --> 02:52:50.008]  I am asking each and every person to listen to this, is to get Alex's movie Terror Storm through Infowar.com or to get my film,
[02:52:50.388 --> 02:52:56.010]  The great illusion through InfoWars.com or FearAndLove.com.
[02:52:56.050 --> 02:52:57.931]  They're very, very affordable.
[02:52:58.531 --> 02:52:59.832]  Share this with friends.
[02:53:00.232 --> 02:53:01.532]  Get the information out.
[02:53:01.692 --> 02:53:06.154]  This is the time and the place for us to make the move.
[02:53:06.314 --> 02:53:06.995]  We're good to go.
[02:53:07.015 --> 02:53:07.175]  I think?
[02:53:28.735 --> 02:53:31.496]  Here locally coming up in a few weeks with a new 9-11 film.
[02:53:31.636 --> 02:53:38.019]  Yeah, there's an incredible new film coming out called 9-11 Mysteries that I think Alex is going to be carrying.
[02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:43.682]  This movie is going to blow the socks off of Loose Change.
[02:53:44.002 --> 02:53:45.503]  Loose Change is a great movie.
[02:53:45.523 --> 02:53:46.784]  I'm not putting Loose Change down.
[02:53:47.124 --> 02:53:51.886]  This thing is over the top excellent.
[02:53:51.986 --> 02:53:53.967]  I believe Alex will be carrying it.
[02:53:54.227 --> 02:53:57.449]  We're going to be showing it at the Dobie Theater on September 11th.
[02:53:58.109 --> 02:53:59.589]  We're going to have him in this week.
[02:54:28.278 --> 02:54:29.660]  Don't be afraid.
[02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:30.901]  Don't be afraid.
[02:54:31.061 --> 02:54:32.022]  Get this information.
[02:54:32.042 --> 02:54:36.367]  People should be afraid of not fighting, of not getting involved, of not standing up.
[02:54:36.407 --> 02:54:37.888]  George, again, I want to thank you for coming in, my friend.
[02:54:37.908 --> 02:54:38.829]  Hey, buddy, I really appreciate it.
[02:54:38.889 --> 02:54:39.210]  You bet.
[02:54:39.230 --> 02:54:39.750]  God bless you.
[02:54:40.571 --> 02:54:45.396]  We are out of time here, ladies and gentlemen, and that was a great, fast two hours.
[02:54:45.756 --> 02:54:47.138]  That was a fast two hours, wasn't it, George?
[02:54:48.078 --> 02:54:48.819]  It's always fast here.
[02:54:50.220 --> 02:54:53.563]  It's like we're in a little time distortion, time warp here.
[02:54:53.863 --> 02:54:55.165]  And yes, he did mention my film.
[02:54:55.205 --> 02:55:02.812]  If you're in central Texas or anywhere in Texas, folks always come in from, I'm always amazed, sometimes foreign countries, coming up next week.
[02:55:03.709 --> 02:55:04.169]  We're good to go.
[02:55:04.210 --> 02:55:04.610]  We're good to go.
[02:55:22.165 --> 02:55:29.268]  In closing, go to Infowars.com, get Terror Storm on DVD with the 66 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neocon Symposium in L.A.
[02:55:29.428 --> 02:55:30.529]  Get it, make copies.

[02:55:42.834 --> 02:55:42.894]  Now...

[02:55:54.792 --> 02:55:56.094]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:56.954 --> 02:55:58.996]  Understand we're at the crossroads right now.
[02:55:59.096 --> 02:56:00.198]  We're at a key point.
[02:56:00.798 --> 02:56:02.179]  All of you, get on the message boards.
[02:56:02.219 --> 02:56:02.960]  Get online.
[02:56:04.201 --> 02:56:05.162]  Talk to your neighbors.
[02:56:05.843 --> 02:56:09.006]  Get the truth about 9-11 out to everybody.
[02:56:09.973 --> 02:56:10.614]  Never stop.
[02:56:10.754 --> 02:56:11.454]  Never surrender.
[02:56:11.835 --> 02:56:12.655]  Never back down.
[02:56:13.316 --> 02:56:14.376]  Know we're telling the truth.
[02:56:14.497 --> 02:56:15.257]  Know your facts.
[02:56:15.337 --> 02:56:16.238]  Know the information.
[02:56:16.658 --> 02:56:18.159]  And we can prevail with God's help.
[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:18.820]  All right.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:20.041]  Again, God bless you all.
[02:56:20.081 --> 02:56:21.642]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
