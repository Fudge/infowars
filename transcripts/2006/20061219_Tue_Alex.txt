[00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:07.951]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:09.811]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:12.932]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:17.334]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:20.095]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:29.339]  Alex Jones Welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome thank you for joining us on this
[00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:48.796]  Worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:50.557]  It is the 19th day of December 2006.
[00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.299]  It is a Tuesday.
[00:00:54.319 --> 00:01:09.248]  I had some guests lined up today, but I decided, as I do on a routine basis, to go ahead and cancel them because I want to have time to cover the news and some of the important issues that face humanity as we fight the global overlords of the New World Order.
[00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:11.654]  We'll have wide open phones.
[00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:16.198]  Whatever issue, whatever story, whatever news item you wish to discuss, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:20.202]  A story here that's been getting a lot of attention was an article written by Jerome Corsi.
[00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.151]  For human events and a clone of it for World Net Daily.
[00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:40.535]  North American Union leader says merger just a crisis away.
[00:01:41.095 --> 00:01:46.199]  Leading intellectual force behind effort towards EU-style unity looks at future.
[00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:51.603]  And he says one more 9-11 attack and we'll have our full North American Union.
[00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:04.660]  That's the same thing that basically General Tommy Franks, when he was on the secret payroll as a propagandist for the White House after he got out of the military, said, oh, it's sad, but it's what's going to happen.
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.821]  It's what the people want.
[00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:07.743]  An end to the Constitution.
[00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:11.787]  A military dictatorship after one more attack.
[00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:16.071]  And I remember on Nightline...
[00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:26.675]  The Wednesday, a week after 9-11, what, eight, nine days after 9-11, U.N.
[00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:29.437]  General McKenzie, the former head of U.N.
[00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:43.304]  Peacekeeping Forces, he'd just gotten out of the U.N., was on Nightline, and he said the answer is a North American continental security perimeter operated and run by an I-4 international U.N.
[00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:43.824]  force.
[00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:45.561]  We're good to go.
[00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:12.765]  Through that system, they claim that getting rid of our borders is what is going to give us security.
[00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:19.511]  That's why US forces will man the Mexican port facility down on Mexico's west coast.
[00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:26.498]  Mexico will be given the Kansas City inland port.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.202]  US and Mexican forces will be up in Canada.
[00:03:32.944 --> 00:03:35.565]  And this is just one way they merge our countries.
[00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:41.487]  We're already inside the North American Union.
[00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:46.328]  We're already inside this system.
[00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.110]  And there's still massive denial on the subject.
[00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:00.093]  So I would suggest to callers, I would hope, we don't screen your calls, and you can bring up whatever issue you'd like or news story you'd like,
[00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:14.242]  But I would suggest that we talk about the North American Union to be merged with the Pan-American Union, and then merged with the other two Asian and EU unions.
[00:04:15.062 --> 00:04:20.085]  This is the official public plan, but still the general public isn't aware of it.
[00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:30.272]  It's been in quite a few newspapers, on a few national TV shows, and on C-SPAN, as CFR members brag about the destruction of the country, and Krobe,
[00:04:31.474 --> 00:04:32.695]  Like a bunch of gamecocks.
[00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:39.921]  But still, on any given day, you type North American Union into Google, you'll get a handful of mainstream articles.
[00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:41.463]  There should be hundreds.
[00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:51.231]  So we'll cover this, get into the Democrats wanting to expand the war, of course, as we said they would, and a lot more.
[00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:53.013]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:57.257]  The websites are InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, and InfoWars.com.
[00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:07.579]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:09.879]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:17.901]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:25.622]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:28.963]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:31.664]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:32.924]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.740]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv
[00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:01.636]  We're good.
[00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:22.197]  We're good to go.
[00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:42.375]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:03.072]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[00:07:03.132 --> 00:07:03.953]  What's wrong?
[00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:05.234]  I am so tired.
[00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:07.775]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:08.996]  I have tried everything.
[00:07:09.056 --> 00:07:10.817]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:07:10.957 --> 00:07:12.098]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:07:12.238 --> 00:07:14.540]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.261]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:18.543]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:20.884]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:07:21.064 --> 00:07:21.585]  The what?
[00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:23.926]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:07:24.066 --> 00:07:29.330]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:32.812]  How well are you sleeping?
[00:07:33.032 --> 00:07:34.672]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?
[00:07:35.052 --> 00:07:39.394]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:07:39.634 --> 00:07:42.935]  The Bed Fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:46.316]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[00:07:46.677 --> 00:07:47.537]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[00:07:47.777 --> 00:07:48.997]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:52.259]  Or are you looking for the perfect gift for that person who has everything?
[00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:53.799]  The Bed Fan is the answer.
[00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:54.839]  Visit BedFan.com.
[00:07:54.859 --> 00:07:56.400]  That's BedFan.com.
[00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:06.126]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:08.829]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:19.379]  Well, a top bioweapons expert...
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:31.166]  Has gone public in the last week saying clearly the anthrax attacks are an inside job launched by our federal government as a pretext for a total police state in America.
[00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:39.731]  We've had this video surface that clearly, and the voice print's been done by a major university professor, it's clearly McVeigh.
[00:08:40.712 --> 00:08:45.955]  Years after, a year and a half after he supposedly left the military, people are asking why is that so important?
[00:08:46.681 --> 00:08:49.264]  Because we always knew he was in a secret military project.
[00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:51.706]  We knew he was involved with Iraqis that were in a secret U.S.
[00:08:51.726 --> 00:08:52.527]  government project.
[00:08:53.027 --> 00:08:58.112]  And we know that he was basically a patsy, just like Lee Harvey Oswald was a U.S.
[00:08:58.152 --> 00:09:02.556]  government agent and was coded in the CIA registry as an agent.
[00:09:03.157 --> 00:09:05.118]  And that that was a staged event as well.
[00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:06.500]  This is huge news.
[00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:11.504]  We have Hillary coming out and saying, well, I wouldn't have voted for the war four years ago, but...
[00:09:12.754 --> 00:09:19.137]  I'm still for the war now that we're there, and I wouldn't have changed my vote.
[00:09:19.738 --> 00:09:22.219]  So weird doublespeak there, if you can figure that out.
[00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:28.702]  And she wants 30,000 more troops, and she wants to go ahead and go into Iran.
[00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:40.949]  So this is the type of behavior we're witnessing by the Democrats, the Armed Services Committee chairman that's coming in, who doesn't know who the Shiites are.
[00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:45.796]  He thinks they're Al-Qaeda when it's the opposite group, even if you believe the fairy tale.
[00:09:46.296 --> 00:09:47.937]  He wants 30,000 more troops.
[00:09:48.117 --> 00:09:56.182]  And Democratic constituency, the main line is saying, let's just continue the war now as long as Democrats are running it.
[00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:57.623]  Everything's fine.
[00:09:58.283 --> 00:10:00.684]  And the Iraq Study Group has done their job.
[00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:02.045]  They've depoliticized it.
[00:10:03.006 --> 00:10:10.670]  They have, quote, put it into this political process where it can be drug out for year after year while the defense contractors make their profits.
[00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:12.834]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:40.511]  Word for word put into law by Executive Fiat last March and then expanded last December by Bush, Paul Martin, and Vicente Fox in Waco towards the North American community.
[00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:50.214]  He says one more big terror attack and that's how we'll get our North American Union selling it that no borders equals security.
[00:10:50.754 --> 00:10:53.395]  So I want to break down that report.
[00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.631]  Also, the U.S.
[00:10:55.691 --> 00:10:59.113]  is planning a Persian Gulf build-up as a warning to Iran.
[00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:03.116]  This is being reported by several big newspapers in the Drugs Report as well as CBS.
[00:11:04.177 --> 00:11:05.838]  Planning a Gulf build-up?
[00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:11.062]  This is the biggest naval build-up we've ever seen in modern history.
[00:11:12.783 --> 00:11:15.385]  Since the British blockade of the Suez Canal.
[00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:19.328]  They've got four carrier task force groups there.
[00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:20.406]  We're good to go.
[00:11:43.857 --> 00:11:45.459]  Unbelievable type report.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.063]  Annie War comes out with a headline that I agree with.
[00:11:48.404 --> 00:11:50.086]  Hillary Clinton, war goddess.
[00:11:50.166 --> 00:11:53.410]  She wants permanent bases in Iraq and threatens war with Iran.
[00:11:56.465 --> 00:12:00.987]  Also, report here, RFID passports cloned within five minutes.
[00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:03.687]  They are designed for identity theft.
[00:12:04.008 --> 00:12:09.749]  That's why our passport system has gone over to this by law starting January 1st.
[00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:14.411]  But already this year, everybody I've talked to who's getting passports have the RFID embedded in them.
[00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:16.572]  We'll break down that report.
[00:12:16.632 --> 00:12:20.233]  Hockey player fired for not signing a flag for U.S.
[00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:20.613]  troops.
[00:12:22.273 --> 00:12:28.535]  Also, Litvinenko killers used plutonium worth $10 million to give massive overdose.
[00:12:31.256 --> 00:12:33.757]  And Litvinenko's father thinks the Russian government killed him.
[00:12:33.777 --> 00:12:36.218]  Litvinenko on his deathbed said the Russian government killed him.
[00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:39.319]  But people don't want to listen to what he'd say on his deathbed.
[00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:46.341]  They think he would just lie and say that to blame an innocent party.
[00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:48.502]  That's mental gymnastics.
[00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:56.556]  There's some evidence the oligarchs could have done it, but it's clear Litvinenko and his father think that Putin did it.
[00:12:56.576 --> 00:13:01.678]  But according to some, Putin was this wonderful creature here to help us, and Russia's a good friend.
[00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.319]  And just, again, Russia does no wrong.
[00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:05.579]  It's all Israel.
[00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:08.420]  No other evil on earth is ever engaged in.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.221]  Not in China, not in Russia.
[00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:12.461]  It's only Israel.
[00:13:12.561 --> 00:13:17.103]  They are the only group that is capable of engaging in sin.
[00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:28.026]  If you slip on a banana peel, if you get lung cancer, if you have an automobile accident, it's sure to be done by Israel.
[00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:33.548]  Which, again, neutralizes any real debate and creates a red herring.
[00:13:33.568 --> 00:13:35.369]  Again, I'm not defending Israel here.
[00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:39.251]  I just get tired of everything being Israel instantly.
[00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:45.013]  Again, I don't know who killed Litvinenko, but more and more evidence leans towards Russia.
[00:13:46.577 --> 00:13:48.318]  And I know we're told this has been to frame Putin.
[00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:49.679]  Putin doesn't care.
[00:13:49.719 --> 00:13:51.820]  He wants people to know he's having them killed.
[00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:53.702]  He wants intimidation.
[00:13:53.742 --> 00:14:00.986]  I mean, speaking of Russia, digressing here for a moment, there's big reports out from New York to L.A.
[00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:05.669]  where there are protests, video police grabbing people's cameras saying, get those cameras.
[00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:07.751]  They steal people's cameras.
[00:14:08.251 --> 00:14:10.572]  They do it on video while others tape it.
[00:14:10.632 --> 00:14:11.333]  They don't care.
[00:14:12.797 --> 00:14:18.802]  They put people in free speech zones where no one can even see what they're saying or doing, where no press can cover them.
[00:14:20.303 --> 00:14:22.004]  This is done to frustrate protests.
[00:14:22.284 --> 00:14:24.466]  Well, the same thing happened over the weekend in Moscow.
[00:14:24.926 --> 00:14:39.177]  A few thousand people bravely showed up to protest against Putin and his police state, and before they could get out of their cars or buses, they were arrested by the hundreds and beaten by riot police because, quote, they didn't have a permit...
[00:14:40.453 --> 00:14:43.734]  And they wouldn't go to designated free speech zones.
[00:14:45.114 --> 00:14:49.596]  But, oh, our press was, oh, this shows what a police state Russia is and how bad they are.
[00:14:50.116 --> 00:14:51.416]  And you're darn right they're bad.
[00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:58.498]  You see, instead of just running over them with tanks or beating them in the streets like they do in China, now it's put into a process.
[00:14:59.558 --> 00:15:00.799]  It's a process of tyranny.
[00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:03.159]  Oh, you didn't get your permit.
[00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:04.620]  Oh, we wouldn't issue you a permit.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.541]  Oh, and you've got to go down here down this alleyway and sit in a pen where nobody can see you.
[00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:12.057]  You see, that's the new America as well.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.683]  I think that's an extremely important facet to discuss.
[00:15:21.325 --> 00:15:28.030]  Also, the Associated Press is falsely suggesting that the National Security Agency can eavesdrop on Americans without a warrant.
[00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:33.134]  Bush, by executive order, has said they can do this, and by memorandum,
[00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:48.642]  But they have not yet gotten a law passed in Congress overturning the Fourth Amendment, and even if they do, that law is null and void according to the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the great body, the great mass of case law.
[00:15:50.602 --> 00:15:56.764]  But again, they're creating this illusion now that, hey, you don't need a warrant anymore.
[00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:01.513]  And we've got local sheriffs on television.
[00:16:02.033 --> 00:16:12.080]  We've got Margo Frazier, back when she was the jack-booted, buzz-cutted commander here locally, saying, we don't need warrants anymore.
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.000]  I've got to find that tape.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.061]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:14.881]  We don't need warrants.
[00:16:15.202 --> 00:16:20.805]  They searched a whole street, a bunch of houses, had people sitting fire ants, kick dogs.
[00:16:21.145 --> 00:16:22.166]  We went out and did interviews.
[00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:24.628]  When she got on the news, they said, well, you didn't have a warrant.
[00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:26.609]  She said, we don't need warrants anymore.
[00:16:27.418 --> 00:16:28.639]  Because she said so!
[00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:31.081]  Because there was a policy she heard about.
[00:16:33.063 --> 00:16:34.004]  You people are sick.
[00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:40.009]  But the border's wide open, and the illegal aliens don't have to have IDs to get bank accounts or housing loans.
[00:16:41.971 --> 00:16:43.012]  Let's go to your calls.
[00:16:43.612 --> 00:16:46.455]  I want to start the broadcast early with your calls.
[00:16:47.378 --> 00:16:47.978]  Hello Alex, how are you doing?
[00:16:47.998 --> 00:16:48.078]  Good.
[00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:09.427]  Hey, a couple things.
[00:17:09.587 --> 00:17:14.449]  One, I heard on the radio this morning, have you heard about the case of David Vance?
[00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:26.153]  It was a contractor in Iraq, and he found out that the company he was working for was an Iraqi company, was smuggling weapons to the insurgents, and he ended up being kept in the prison that Saddam Hussein is.
[00:17:26.493 --> 00:17:32.215]  He ended up being arrested, basically, after blowing the whistle on weapons being smuggled to the insurgents.
[00:17:33.936 --> 00:17:35.016]  And who was smuggling them?
[00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:38.801]  He worked for an Iraqi security company.
[00:17:38.821 --> 00:17:45.366]  He's an American, but the company he worked for was Iraqi.
[00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:48.209]  He found out that they were smuggling weapons to the insurgents.
[00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:58.218]  Also, the New York Times report said that he saw American soldiers who would trade bullets for alcohol and other things for weapons repairs.
[00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:03.242]  I heard him being interviewed on the NPR program On Point this morning.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:12.629]  And it was kind of really crazy how some of the, like the lawyer that was arguing for the other side was saying, well, he was in a war zone and so it means he doesn't have any rights.
[00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:14.290]  But he got picked up at the U.S.
[00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.771]  Embassy.
[00:18:15.411 --> 00:18:17.393]  So someone called in and made the point, wasn't the U.S.
[00:18:17.453 --> 00:18:20.236]  Embassy American soil?
[00:18:20.496 --> 00:18:27.263]  And the lawyer then said, well, I'm not sure if that's true or not, but he was in a war zone and da, da, da, da, da.
[00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:32.873]  So they've gone from saying that Iraqis and terrorists... Well, that's what they do.
[00:18:32.913 --> 00:18:33.454]  That's what they do.
[00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:42.059]  They take a huge story that shows that our government, the Israelis, the British, are busy arming, quote, the insurgency to keep the war going.
[00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:48.143]  I haven't seen this new report, but it fits in with all the past, literally hundreds of reports confirmed of this.
[00:18:48.163 --> 00:18:52.906]  And then they spin it into, oh, this just shows how things are crumbling.
[00:18:52.946 --> 00:18:54.507]  And then our government...
[00:18:54.847 --> 00:19:01.549]  You're saying allowed an American citizen to be hauled off to the Baghdad airport there.
[00:19:01.589 --> 00:19:02.869]  I can email you the report.
[00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:06.190]  Well, I'm sure I can type his name into Google News and find it.
[00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.530]  You say his name is Robert Vance?
[00:19:07.991 --> 00:19:09.031]  David Vance.
[00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:14.752]  And also, On Point had a radio archive of him being interviewed on the radio this morning.
[00:19:14.812 --> 00:19:16.753]  Okay, what was the final point you were going to make about this?
[00:19:18.534 --> 00:19:19.575]  Well, that was all about this.
[00:19:20.175 --> 00:19:22.556]  But also, you're asking about the North American Union.
[00:19:22.576 --> 00:19:25.998]  There's some news here in Tennessee I saw in the newspaper about a month or so ago.
[00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:33.723]  They're trying to bring the toll roads here now, using the argument that they're not getting enough money from the gasoline tax.
[00:19:33.823 --> 00:19:36.745]  And again, that's going to be their main taxing mechanism.
[00:19:36.785 --> 00:19:37.565]  Okay, thank you.
[00:19:37.906 --> 00:19:39.847]  I'll comment on that when we get back.
[00:19:41.148 --> 00:19:45.010]  Simultaneously, they're announcing that existing roads are going to be toll roads.
[00:19:45.589 --> 00:19:48.351]  And then if you read the fine print, almost in all cases, it's foreign-owned.
[00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:50.952]  And we're going into receivership.
[00:19:51.673 --> 00:19:54.255]  And even a lot of patriots don't want to admit how bad it is.
[00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:57.957]  We have to admit how bad it is to then set about fixing it.
[00:19:58.297 --> 00:19:58.958]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.978 --> 00:19:59.378]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.513 --> 00:20:07.177]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:20:07.598 --> 00:20:13.024]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:20:13.485 --> 00:20:18.591]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:32.620]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:38.424]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:44.589]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:20:45.009 --> 00:20:45.069]  1-800-686-2237
[00:21:04.508 --> 00:21:05.549]  The war on terrorism.
[00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:08.651]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:08.931 --> 00:21:13.074]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:13.515 --> 00:21:14.335]  So what do you do?
[00:21:14.656 --> 00:21:19.239]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:19.719 --> 00:21:21.841]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:22.341 --> 00:21:23.182]  Sheltering in place.
[00:21:23.618 --> 00:21:24.559]  We're good to go.

[00:22:06.322 --> 00:22:12.926]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:22:14.136 --> 00:22:16.437]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:22:17.238 --> 00:22:23.482]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:22:24.362 --> 00:22:32.487]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:22:33.488 --> 00:22:41.313]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:43.419 --> 00:23:44.419]  Come, you masters of war!
[00:24:08.425 --> 00:24:10.406]  Here they build the big guns.
[00:24:12.768 --> 00:24:15.190]  Here they build the death planes.
[00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:19.052]  Here they build all the bombs.
[00:24:21.434 --> 00:24:23.855]  Here they hide behind walls.
[00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:27.698]  Here they hide behind desks.
[00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:34.242]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[00:24:34.803 --> 00:24:35.383]  Welcome back.
[00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.391]  You that never done nothing.
[00:24:38.651 --> 00:24:44.055]  Yeah, the caller mentioned that in Tennessee it's in their paper how great it is and how wonderful it is.
[00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:56.244]  Whether you live in Austin, Texas or Knoxville, Tennessee or if you live in Boise, Idaho, it doesn't matter, or Los Angeles, California or New York, it's the same article.
[00:24:57.084 --> 00:25:04.630]  There's not as much gas tax money and the roads are falling apart and there's no money and we've got to have a
[00:25:06.314 --> 00:25:12.278]  Toll road tax on existing roads and on new roads to fund it.
[00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:22.804]  Well, number one, we have the Texas Department of Transportation documents, California Department of Transportation documents, they've all come out, that they are making record amounts of money.
[00:25:23.715 --> 00:25:34.680]  Now, you don't need their documents to know that if we're using 15 million barrels of oil a decade ago, and they're using 22, 23 million barrels a day and growing every year, and you can read the gross receipts.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.160]  They are just astronomical.
[00:25:36.721 --> 00:25:49.186]  And the TxDOT document that came out about a year and a half ago, it was in the paper locally, said that it was TxDOT internally, and it said, you know, this is for your eyes only, not for distribution.
[00:25:50.147 --> 00:25:50.967]  This is restricted.
[00:25:52.074 --> 00:25:55.757]  And they reported on it, and it said, we've got tons of money.
[00:25:55.797 --> 00:25:57.178]  We've got huge surpluses.
[00:25:57.858 --> 00:26:07.966]  Why are we doing this, and why are we selling off roads that we've just built or roads we've already just redone to this company, and why is it for such a small sum?
[00:26:09.587 --> 00:26:18.013]  Now, people in the agencies high up that ask questions like that are just, you know, think they should be doing their job and having a good service, and you don't understand.
[00:26:18.834 --> 00:26:21.396]  You didn't hear Joseph Sticklitz on the show a month ago, did you?
[00:26:22.139 --> 00:26:22.580]  We're good to go.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:22.760]  I think?
[00:26:45.439 --> 00:27:02.346]  And federal agencies and water districts began taking the lion's share of the tax revenue, and they began investing it in the stock market and in private companies as well until 75 plus percent.
[00:27:02.366 --> 00:27:03.126]  I keep saying 70.
[00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.507]  It's 75 plus percent.
[00:27:04.847 --> 00:27:07.468]  That's the latest numbers out from Walter Burian and others.
[00:27:07.868 --> 00:27:14.831]  The former auditor of the Air Force has also gone public and done his own analysis and has found 70 plus percent.
[00:27:16.129 --> 00:27:22.351]  And so what happens is the corporations get key people into office, key city managers in, key school district managers.
[00:27:22.751 --> 00:27:23.871]  They then invest the money.
[00:27:23.931 --> 00:27:31.313]  They then revolving door back and forth between government going up the ladder into higher and higher corporate structures.
[00:27:31.834 --> 00:27:33.774]  And then they're getting $1 million, $500,000, $2 million a year salaries.
[00:27:33.794 --> 00:27:35.935]  And then they'll rotate back in and get $100,000 a year in a city for a few years.
[00:27:36.415 --> 00:27:37.915]  And then they'll rotate back in.
[00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:51.317]  That's why a politician will spend $20 million to get into office as a congressman, to get paid $100-something thousand a year.
[00:27:52.899 --> 00:27:57.324]  And so it's an open, delayed kickback in that revolving door.
[00:27:58.685 --> 00:28:05.352]  And so the corporations, the global corporations, have bought up the entire stock market with your own money.
[00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:19.188]  And then they like to rip off stockholders every few decades with Enron or Global Crossing where you'll see them start moving the assets out of a big dummy corporation because they don't even want to let you stockholders, low-level stockholders, have a piece of the action.
[00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:24.229]  Then they blow that out like the mafia, because they are the mafia, and then move that into other assets.
[00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:27.990]  And then if you invest too heavily in that, they'll blow that out.
[00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:31.231]  It's all about total consolidation.
[00:28:33.368 --> 00:28:36.571]  And that's what your comprehensive annual financial reports are about.
[00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:39.353]  And so now they've got 75% of the stock market.
[00:28:39.373 --> 00:28:56.208]  Now they're going to raise taxes to a point and devalue your dollar to a point and blow out some of the places you were still able to invest the dollar sink of real estate until you're totally destitute.
[00:28:56.328 --> 00:28:57.669]  That's the goal.
[00:28:58.009 --> 00:28:59.170]  Destroy middle class.
[00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.952]  Destroy independent assets.
[00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:04.808]  So instead of 75%, they've got even more.
[00:29:05.228 --> 00:29:25.377]  And so now they've got all this money and all this power with your tax money, and so now they just go in with the politicians they own and the politicians they've lobbied, and they have the politicians, for pennies on the dollar, sign over with no liability the roads, the water, the lakes, management of the borders, the police.
[00:29:25.517 --> 00:29:27.098]  Police are going private in some areas.
[00:29:27.378 --> 00:29:29.399]  They legalize mercenaries domestically.
[00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:31.680]  Total bondage.
[00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:34.246]  Total bondage.
[00:29:35.447 --> 00:29:37.089]  See, it isn't about a free market.
[00:29:37.369 --> 00:29:41.112]  They're just rounding up the last few pools of capital right now.
[00:29:41.332 --> 00:29:50.179]  Then, when they've got you where they want you, the one-shot policy starts, the sterilization starts, the extermination starts.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.681]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.182 --> 00:29:54.763]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.704 --> 00:29:58.386]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.341 --> 00:30:04.729]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:05.268 --> 00:30:08.569]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:30:08.949 --> 00:30:11.890]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:18.532]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:30:18.612 --> 00:30:23.053]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:30:23.273 --> 00:30:27.614]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:30:27.794 --> 00:30:30.395]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:30:30.415 --> 00:30:33.156]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:30:33.636 --> 00:30:36.178]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:30:36.218 --> 00:30:40.481]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:41.401]  Treasury bonds.
[00:30:41.662 --> 00:30:46.285]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:48.126]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.707]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[00:31:01.348 --> 00:31:03.189]  Dad, can we stop?
[00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:05.049]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[00:31:05.469 --> 00:31:05.710]  What?
[00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.430]  Again?
[00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.471]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[00:31:08.551 --> 00:31:12.952]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[00:31:13.192 --> 00:31:14.493]  Why did you do that?
[00:31:14.693 --> 00:31:20.495]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[00:31:20.795 --> 00:31:21.815]  Are we there yet?
[00:31:21.915 --> 00:31:22.996]  for the entire trip.
[00:31:23.236 --> 00:31:25.436]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:26.917]  Great idea.
[00:31:26.937 --> 00:31:29.778]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[00:31:30.157 --> 00:31:32.622]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[00:31:32.822 --> 00:31:37.231]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[00:31:37.511 --> 00:31:37.812]  Honey!
[00:31:38.635 --> 00:31:39.876]  You're terrific!
[00:31:40.276 --> 00:31:41.757]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[00:31:41.877 --> 00:31:45.278]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[00:31:45.558 --> 00:31:46.339]  Now can we stop?
[00:31:46.839 --> 00:31:47.579]  I need to go, too.

[00:32:53.332 --> 00:32:54.613]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:34.831]  Alright, I'm going to go back to Kitty, Heavy, David, Johnny, John, others.
[00:33:35.952 --> 00:33:36.872]  But let me just say this.
[00:33:40.913 --> 00:33:42.613]  I got some friends that go way back.
[00:33:42.633 --> 00:33:43.494]  They're nice folks.
[00:33:46.074 --> 00:33:50.355]  And their little cable TV show comes on before my little show on Monday nights right now.
[00:33:51.355 --> 00:33:53.236]  And I was down at the TV station last night.
[00:33:55.848 --> 00:33:59.871]  I'm like running around doing so much stuff during the break, I'm actually at a loss for breath.
[00:33:59.891 --> 00:34:02.952]  That's how crazy it is here at this office.
[00:34:05.094 --> 00:34:17.622]  And I'm there, and I see the chairman of the Travis County Republican Party sitting there on this TV show.
[00:34:19.062 --> 00:34:24.746]  And so at the end of the show, a lot of times I'll pop on because they come on right before me, and so when their show ends, mine comes on, same channel.
[00:34:25.433 --> 00:34:30.034]  And so at the end of the show, most weeks, I'll walk in and talk about, you know, 60 seconds, say something, and leave.
[00:34:30.614 --> 00:34:32.695]  Oh, I saw the chairman of the Republican Party in there.
[00:34:34.255 --> 00:34:50.639]  So I go in there, and I walk up behind him, and I start saying, you know, Bush is really a liberal, and we need to get past this left-right paradigm, and Bush is for gun control, and Bush was for the assault weapons ban, and the chairman of the Republican Party here in Austin said,
[00:34:51.164 --> 00:34:55.808]  Here in Travis County, very important chairmanship at the state level politics.
[00:34:56.508 --> 00:34:57.589]  He just said, no, he isn't.
[00:34:57.609 --> 00:34:58.210]  It's not true.
[00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:00.572]  And I said, and he's for the North American Union.
[00:35:02.293 --> 00:35:02.813]  No, he's not.
[00:35:02.853 --> 00:35:03.434]  It's not true.
[00:35:03.574 --> 00:35:06.056]  And he spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[00:35:06.136 --> 00:35:06.877]  No, it's not true.
[00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:12.401]  And I went on to say, no, it is true.
[00:35:13.182 --> 00:35:18.646]  And then even the host, who I know and who's pro-gun and knows about the New World Order, a conservative person,
[00:35:21.463 --> 00:35:26.947]  Started defending and saying, well, Bush said he'd sign the assault weapons ban, but he didn't lobby for it.
[00:35:29.929 --> 00:35:44.919]  And I've talked about, that's the same thing I got when I was in McBride's, I don't know, four or five months ago, six months ago, whenever Cheney had shot the lawyer, clearly at closer than 30 feet.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.742]  Well, they claimed they'd shot him at...
[00:35:50.922 --> 00:35:51.683]  At 90 feet.
[00:35:53.904 --> 00:35:54.745]  Or 30 yards.
[00:35:55.966 --> 00:35:58.908]  And our evidence showed they shot him at about 30 feet or closer.
[00:35:59.628 --> 00:36:01.009]  We went out and did a ballistics test.
[00:36:03.051 --> 00:36:05.433]  Had a policeman out there, an engineer, others.
[00:36:06.253 --> 00:36:07.694]  Shot it into a latex dummy.
[00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:08.755]  Boxing dummy.
[00:36:11.157 --> 00:36:15.300]  And I walk into McBride's to buy the same gauge pop gun shotgun.
[00:36:16.864 --> 00:36:23.528]  And that Chaney has, you know, the same bore, the same load, a cheaper shotgun, not a big fancy carved $20,000 one.
[00:36:26.229 --> 00:36:31.452]  And I'm in there waiting to buy it, and I couldn't control myself.
[00:36:31.492 --> 00:36:36.335]  I bought another gun for myself while I was in there, one that wasn't just for the test I did.
[00:36:38.816 --> 00:36:45.500]  And a guy comes over to me and says, one of the people there at McBride's, nice gun shop, a lot of people in there, a lot of salesmen,
[00:36:46.886 --> 00:36:50.328]  He says, hey, I heard you say Bush was for the assaultments ban.
[00:36:50.348 --> 00:36:51.289]  You know, that's not true.
[00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.031]  And I said, yeah, it is.
[00:36:54.271 --> 00:36:54.891]  It's true.
[00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:58.073]  And he said, no, no, I heard him give a speech saying he was for the Second Amendment.
[00:36:59.454 --> 00:37:01.956]  And I said, yeah, but what definition of the Second Amendment is that?
[00:37:02.796 --> 00:37:09.160]  And I said, unless prescribed by law, which then they claim these laws and regulations supersede the Bill of Rights.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.203]  And then a manager walks over and goes, hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:37:13.223 --> 00:37:13.703]  Fan of the show?
[00:37:13.723 --> 00:37:14.724]  He goes, yeah, he's right.
[00:37:14.764 --> 00:37:15.204]  It's true.
[00:37:17.031 --> 00:37:18.773]  And the fellow looked like a deer in the headlights.
[00:37:18.873 --> 00:37:22.936]  And it's the same thing with friends of mine, people I know.
[00:37:24.858 --> 00:37:26.320]  They're just in denial.
[00:37:27.761 --> 00:37:30.103]  In fact, I thought about getting Jimmy Ritter on the show today.
[00:37:30.323 --> 00:37:33.386]  Maybe we can... I don't even think I have his cell phone number at my office.
[00:37:33.406 --> 00:37:34.187]  I know I have it at home.
[00:37:34.207 --> 00:37:35.748]  I forgot to get it this morning out of the computer.
[00:37:36.509 --> 00:37:38.271]  Maybe we can call around and get Ritter's number.
[00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:38.991]  I know he listens.
[00:37:39.011 --> 00:37:41.093]  I don't know if he can get in, though.
[00:37:41.113 --> 00:37:41.894]  The lines are loaded.
[00:37:45.128 --> 00:37:48.910]  Because I want to have a discussion with somebody who's not a bad person and who means well.
[00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:56.015]  Jimmy's big into guns, big into the Second Amendment, and he was there going, well, Alex, he's not really for gun control.
[00:37:56.035 --> 00:38:00.458]  And I just don't understand it.
[00:38:00.538 --> 00:38:02.139]  I mean, I literally lose sleep at night.
[00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:05.001]  I literally have trouble going to sleep sometimes, even when I'm exhausted.
[00:38:05.601 --> 00:38:07.542]  And, you know, it's always late at night.
[00:38:07.562 --> 00:38:08.583]  It's when things are quiet.
[00:38:08.623 --> 00:38:13.466]  That's when I tend to lose my good attitude that I have and my go-getter attitude, and I kind of get sad.
[00:38:14.747 --> 00:38:23.754]  And I'll kind of just sit there on a chair by my bed before I go to sleep, literally with my head down, just literally grieving for my country.
[00:38:23.894 --> 00:38:26.075]  I mean, it's gone, folks!
[00:38:27.236 --> 00:38:28.757]  The North American Union's here.
[00:38:28.837 --> 00:38:30.819]  Bush is pushing total blanket amnesty.
[00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:34.121]  The Democrats are sure to vote with him for blanket amnesty.
[00:38:35.062 --> 00:38:38.364]  They've abolished the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, habeas corpus.
[00:38:38.424 --> 00:38:39.285]  It's all admitted.
[00:38:39.906 --> 00:38:42.988]  The Democrats are all for it now, right along with Bush.
[00:38:44.364 --> 00:38:55.689]  And I can't even get people I've known for 10, 12 years who know all about the New World Order to even admit to themselves that Bush is evil.
[00:38:58.331 --> 00:38:59.831]  Again, he's just a puppet.
[00:39:03.053 --> 00:39:08.675]  And that Republican Party chairman in Travis County just, nope, nope, nope, nope, Bush is a conservative.
[00:39:09.756 --> 00:39:11.717]  But I'm a pig with wings from Pluto.
[00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:30.795]  Because it just... It's like when we play the CFR clip on the internet, on YouTube, and there's a message board, there's comments under it, and there's a bunch of people in there going, Oh, Dick Cheney's anti-eastern establishment.
[00:39:31.055 --> 00:39:32.395]  He's anti-CFR.
[00:39:32.695 --> 00:39:34.216]  He's anti-New World Order.
[00:39:34.296 --> 00:39:35.736]  In fact, find that clip for me again.
[00:39:35.756 --> 00:39:36.796]  I want to play that here in a second.
[00:39:39.797 --> 00:39:40.997]  And they post under it.
[00:39:41.458 --> 00:39:42.298]  And they're serious.
[00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:42.738]  They say...
[00:39:44.053 --> 00:39:44.594]  You know what?
[00:39:44.654 --> 00:39:48.237]  Either this clip's fake, or he's just joking around.
[00:39:48.317 --> 00:39:50.339]  You know, he didn't really mean this.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:51.720]  No, no, no.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.442]  He's against David Rockefeller.
[00:39:54.963 --> 00:40:02.150]  The guy's been financed since before he got into Congress by the Rockefeller Crime Syndicate.
[00:40:03.531 --> 00:40:04.893]  The guy's vacationed with him.
[00:40:05.653 --> 00:40:07.275]  They go to constant luncheons with him.
[00:40:08.653 --> 00:40:15.919]  They have said they're Rockefeller Republicans, they're implementing it down the line, and then he makes a joke, knowing it's probably too late for America.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:25.368]  This bastard makes a joke about it, and these people can't even see it when he's sitting there laughing at them in their face!
[00:40:26.148 --> 00:40:26.769]  Here it is!
[00:40:27.569 --> 00:40:30.172]  It's good to be back at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:40:30.292 --> 00:40:36.197]  As Pete mentioned, I've been a member for a long time and was actually a director for some period of time.
[00:40:36.969 --> 00:40:40.551]  I never mentioned that when I was campaigning for re-election back home in Wyoming.
[00:40:45.294 --> 00:40:49.557]  He never mentioned that when he was back in his state campaigning.
[00:40:49.797 --> 00:40:51.138]  Ha ha ha!
[00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.881]  It's so funny.
[00:40:56.442 --> 00:40:57.843]  It's hilarious.
[00:40:59.063 --> 00:41:06.068]  The size of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms has tripled in the last six years.
[00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:10.470]  Please don't send me an email saying I'm changing my story.
[00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.531]  I've been saying double for the last five years.
[00:41:13.711 --> 00:41:14.231]  I looked it up.
[00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.632]  It's now roughly tripled.
[00:41:16.792 --> 00:41:18.773]  It's a little under-tripling, if you want to get exact.
[00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:19.853]  The budget.
[00:41:21.714 --> 00:41:23.055]  These goons are everywhere.
[00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:28.637]  Harassing gun dealers, gun shops, undercovers at the gun shows.
[00:41:28.697 --> 00:41:29.237]  It's horrible.
[00:41:30.858 --> 00:41:32.778]  See, I'm wedded to the Second Amendment.
[00:41:32.858 --> 00:41:34.459]  I'm not wedded to that little
[00:41:37.463 --> 00:41:41.204]  Pervert George W. Bush, who himself is nothing but a puppet.
[00:41:42.505 --> 00:41:49.427]  I mean, I put my life, my treasure, my name, everything on the line, trying to defend this country, this republic.
[00:41:52.848 --> 00:42:06.572]  And there are a lot of so-called conservatives out there, a lot of them well-meaning, who just can't get it, and who are not going to get it, and who don't want to get it.
[00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:12.330]  We're good to go.
[00:42:38.374 --> 00:43:03.371]  To know that we have psychopathic criminal elites who are putting poisons in our water and our medications, our drugs, who are destroying on purpose the fabric of society and saying they're doing it, who run giant child and woman and even men for slave labor camps openly.
[00:43:03.431 --> 00:43:05.292]  It's in major papers and nothing's done.
[00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:24.729]  Individuals who have debased our currency, who have completely bankrupted our nation and our future, and then they openly say they're going to set up a tyranny that is very close to a mixture of the Soviet Union and Nazi principles?
[00:43:26.911 --> 00:43:32.175]  And it's the very same grandsons of the people that funded Mao and Hitler and Stalin?
[00:43:33.316 --> 00:43:34.857]  I mean, they don't play games!
[00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:41.052]  These are devils that we're talking about.
[00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:42.853]  As Paris said.
[00:43:42.873 --> 00:43:48.095]  I mean, I see an array, an enemy army all around us.
[00:43:48.375 --> 00:43:51.196]  There are dark generals laughing at us on television.
[00:43:53.657 --> 00:43:58.599]  And then I see people who can't even comprehend it when it's in their face.
[00:43:58.659 --> 00:44:00.280]  People leering at them.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.542]  Who have murder in their hearts for you and your family.
[00:44:03.842 --> 00:44:06.523]  Who are openly declared war on you.
[00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:11.090]  And you don't even know?
[00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:12.971]  You don't want to know?
[00:44:13.512 --> 00:44:15.073]  When they've declared war?
[00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:17.414]  And I'm the extremist.
[00:44:17.795 --> 00:44:18.895]  I'm the nutjob.
[00:44:19.436 --> 00:44:20.897]  I'm the guy that's crazy.
[00:44:21.257 --> 00:44:22.558]  I shouldn't get upset.
[00:44:22.918 --> 00:44:24.139]  I shouldn't be angry.
[00:44:24.459 --> 00:44:30.403]  I should sit here and calmly report as this country goes down like the SS Titanic.
[00:44:31.064 --> 00:44:32.925]  And we shouldn't even go to the lifeboats.
[00:44:33.286 --> 00:44:34.046]  We shouldn't yell.
[00:44:34.086 --> 00:44:34.987]  We shouldn't scream.
[00:44:35.167 --> 00:44:40.271]  We shouldn't go to the rooftops and the hilltops and the valleys and warn everybody.
[00:44:43.073 --> 00:44:47.856]  We should just sit down and shut up and go quietly into the night.
[00:44:47.896 --> 00:44:48.537]  Well, you know what?
[00:44:48.637 --> 00:44:49.617]  I'm never going to do that.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.062]  And Lord knows I'm not perfect, but I tell you what, at least I'm fighting.
[00:44:58.264 --> 00:44:59.965]  And at least I'm putting in long hours.
[00:45:01.633 --> 00:45:06.416]  And doing everything I can, possibly, to defend this republic.
[00:45:10.758 --> 00:45:15.861]  It's time for the denial to end.
[00:45:19.282 --> 00:45:24.945]  It's time for people who have wedded themselves to an evil system to realize they're laughing at you.
[00:45:27.287 --> 00:45:29.868]  To realize there is no lesser of two evils.
[00:45:34.491 --> 00:45:37.734]  That's what I'm begging you out there to let burn into your minds.
[00:45:38.094 --> 00:45:41.397]  And I'm talking to the people who know we're telling the truth, who've researched what we're saying.
[00:45:41.777 --> 00:45:43.598]  I'm asking you to call into other talk shows.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.683]  I'm asking you to set up websites.
[00:45:48.763 --> 00:45:51.925]  I'm asking you to get my films and make copies and aggressively get them out.
[00:45:52.165 --> 00:45:53.406]  I mean, I mean it when I say it.
[00:45:53.647 --> 00:46:01.393]  And to go on the message boards and to email your email list and to tell them to tune into this radio show today and any other radio show that's telling it like it is.
[00:46:04.426 --> 00:46:08.750]  Because we've woken the people up, but we've only woken them up to a threat and that they're being lied to.
[00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:10.732]  They don't know how they're being lied to.
[00:46:10.972 --> 00:46:13.794]  They don't have any inkling just how bad it is.
[00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:22.102]  And they're being diverted off into all these other spin controls and into these little rabbit trails and into these steam valves.
[00:46:22.182 --> 00:46:24.584]  And it just makes my blood boil.
[00:46:25.165 --> 00:46:27.587]  Frankly, a lot of days it just makes me sick at my stomach.
[00:46:27.647 --> 00:46:28.688]  Just disgusts me.
[00:46:31.332 --> 00:46:37.017]  Our bureaucracies, our police, our military, everything is being merged right now.
[00:46:39.038 --> 00:46:49.947]  United Nations peacekeeping heads are on nightline saying there's going to be another attack, and when there is, we're going into a North American Union and UN troops are going to patrol America.
[00:46:50.167 --> 00:46:51.649]  Hey man, that isn't Alex Jones.
[00:46:51.669 --> 00:46:52.409]  That's nightline.
[00:46:53.710 --> 00:47:00.656]  That's the head CFR chair over the North American Union project, American University professor Robert Pastore.
[00:47:02.409 --> 00:47:06.192]  Headline, North American Union leader says merger just a crisis away.
[00:47:06.632 --> 00:47:11.315]  Leading intellectual force behind effort towards EU-style unity looks at future.
[00:47:16.979 --> 00:47:22.203]  Robert Pasture, a leading intellectual force in the move to create an EU-style North American Union, pulled the world net daily.
[00:47:22.223 --> 00:47:23.864]  He believes a new 9-11 crisis...
[00:47:24.793 --> 00:47:25.333]  It's already set up.
[00:47:25.353 --> 00:47:27.155]  They've already picked Atlanta as the capital.
[00:47:27.175 --> 00:47:28.456]  I mean, this is all... I mean...
[00:47:53.358 --> 00:47:54.939]  Ten years ago, I told you it would be the Amero.
[00:47:56.159 --> 00:47:58.020]  Ten years ago, I told you it would be Atlanta.
[00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:00.301]  Ten years ago, they were already merging.
[00:48:00.321 --> 00:48:05.984]  It's like a month ago, they announced in the Asia Times, the Tokyo News, it was all in there.
[00:48:07.564 --> 00:48:20.110]  Oh, the Asian Union was really set up ten years ago, but now the Asian Union Partnership, or whatever the name was, is now officially calling itself the Asian Union, saying the public is now ready for it.
[00:48:21.269 --> 00:48:22.570]  Because of the threat of North Korea.
[00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.791]  What does that have to do with it?
[00:48:24.031 --> 00:48:24.811]  See, it's the same thing here.
[00:48:24.831 --> 00:48:27.633]  You know, oh, there's a threat.
[00:48:27.673 --> 00:48:39.801]  The answer is multinational forces on the continental border of North America from the Mexico-Guatemala border to the south all the way up to the tip of Alaska.
[00:48:41.582 --> 00:48:42.363]  I mean, we're in it.
[00:48:43.723 --> 00:48:47.144]  So for all these years, the people wouldn't believe they were setting it up.
[00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:51.305]  Now they announce it, and people are just thinking that there's a discussion of it.
[00:48:51.705 --> 00:48:56.686]  We're in it, and people now, some people now, have heard it's coming.
[00:48:59.267 --> 00:49:03.668]  It's like hearing, yeah, there's a good chance someday if I live long enough I'll get cancer.
[00:49:04.488 --> 00:49:05.848]  No, no, no, no, you've got it.
[00:49:06.268 --> 00:49:07.428]  It's eating up your body.
[00:49:07.488 --> 00:49:08.289]  It's everywhere.
[00:49:10.638 --> 00:49:13.560]  And you're saying, oh no, I might get cancer someday.
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:23.368]  You know, first, cancer didn't exist, okay, when we had it.
[00:49:24.049 --> 00:49:33.456]  Now it's taken over the whole body, and then now we've just gotten to the point of saying, maybe cancer exists somewhere in mammals, okay?
[00:49:36.104 --> 00:49:39.486]  And I'm sitting here going, look at them!
[00:49:39.886 --> 00:49:40.766]  Look what they're doing!
[00:49:41.427 --> 00:49:42.547]  The cameras are going up.
[00:49:42.587 --> 00:49:43.808]  The face scanners are going up.
[00:49:43.848 --> 00:49:46.129]  The police have been militarized and brainwashed against us.
[00:49:46.469 --> 00:49:54.613]  They're totally legalizing the illegals, merging the Social Security system, accepting everything without ID cards for the North American Union.
[00:49:54.934 --> 00:49:57.875]  The guest worker program is their North American Union ID card.
[00:49:57.895 --> 00:49:59.216]  It's in the SPP documents.
[00:49:59.436 --> 00:50:03.358]  It's all being done by fiat, executive fiat, orders to the bureaucracies.
[00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:08.323]  And I know you know this.
[00:50:08.583 --> 00:50:09.844]  I know you're aware of this.
[00:50:09.984 --> 00:50:12.985]  But we've got to get out and warn the people.
[00:50:14.005 --> 00:50:20.847]  And I know you've tried, but I know a lot of them just... Well, I know George Bush is still good.
[00:50:21.747 --> 00:50:22.947]  But he's for open borders.
[00:50:23.007 --> 00:50:23.808]  He's for gun control.
[00:50:24.148 --> 00:50:25.628]  Oh, no, he's not.
[00:50:27.048 --> 00:50:32.710]  I like George W. George W. doesn't run anything.
[00:50:33.484 --> 00:50:37.745]  Hillary, that snot-nosed witch, doesn't run anything.
[00:50:39.725 --> 00:50:42.206]  Barack Obama doesn't run anything.
[00:50:42.786 --> 00:50:44.906]  These people are bought and paid for.
[00:50:45.746 --> 00:50:48.067]  They're working together against all of us.
[00:50:48.087 --> 00:50:50.787]  Alright, I will go directly to your calls.
[00:50:51.587 --> 00:50:55.828]  Kitty, Heavy, David, Johnny, John and others on the other side.
[00:50:56.188 --> 00:50:57.689]  Keep it locked in.
[00:50:58.509 --> 00:50:59.669]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.708 --> 00:51:07.889]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.229 --> 00:51:10.169]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.529 --> 00:51:18.191]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.871 --> 00:51:25.932]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.333 --> 00:51:29.273]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:31.974]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.394 --> 00:51:33.214]  NSA spies.
[00:51:33.786 --> 00:51:35.087]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:54:16.592 --> 00:54:19.594]  My first seven films, I've been so busy I never put them on DVD.
[00:54:20.094 --> 00:54:21.435]  They were all on DVD.
[00:54:22.275 --> 00:54:25.638]  And we've got a deal where you can get them for, what, like $12 a piece?

[00:54:36.158 --> 00:54:36.318]  I think?
[00:55:00.146 --> 00:55:05.891]  Available on DVD, 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com.

[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:20.783]  Let's go ahead and go to Kitty in New Hampshire.
[00:55:20.823 --> 00:55:21.484]  Thanks for holding.
[00:55:21.504 --> 00:55:21.904]  Go ahead.
[00:55:22.305 --> 00:55:22.945]  Hello, Alex.
[00:55:23.065 --> 00:55:23.566]  I love you.
[00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:27.349]  I call because I have a problem and I don't know how to get rid of it.
[00:55:28.129 --> 00:55:30.170]  I got a visit from a truant officer.
[00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:35.511]  He told me I have to register my child with the state or the district school.
[00:55:36.371 --> 00:55:51.396]  When I called, there's no state superintendent of schools, and I called Charlotte Isabet, and she told me to call the state, but there's no way you can because there is no...
[00:55:52.014 --> 00:55:53.876]  Suppose it's state superintendent.
[00:55:54.476 --> 00:56:02.985]  Okay, okay, what they do all over the country, I don't know New Hampshire law, but it's generally the same, so I'm not giving you legal advice, but I'm telling you generally what the law is.
[00:56:04.042 --> 00:56:08.166]  In California and Illinois, they've openly tried to ban homeschooling.
[00:56:08.547 --> 00:56:17.476]  First they say, oh, when you don't have your child in our system, you've got to sign a form saying that they're not in our system, even if they're private schooled or homeschooled.
[00:56:17.556 --> 00:56:18.257]  Total control.
[00:56:18.537 --> 00:56:22.001]  Here's the state saying they're the guardian, which they've now openly announced.
[00:56:22.761 --> 00:56:24.163]  And so they're giving you permission.
[00:56:24.723 --> 00:56:26.225]  There's no law in these states.
[00:56:26.285 --> 00:56:27.206]  They just say it.
[00:56:27.888 --> 00:56:28.908]  We're good to go.
[00:56:29.028 --> 00:56:29.269]  I think?
[00:56:49.304 --> 00:56:53.926]  They're very angry because they want to get your child registered into the system.
[00:56:54.266 --> 00:56:56.027]  Then they can start micromanaging.
[00:56:57.567 --> 00:57:07.531]  You need to call the county or that particular school district to find out particularly which jurisdiction that that truant officer is under.
[00:57:09.572 --> 00:57:11.192]  First off, how old are your children?
[00:57:11.712 --> 00:57:13.513]  Eleven.
[00:57:13.773 --> 00:57:14.974]  How long have they been homeschooled?
[00:57:17.042 --> 00:57:17.883]  Since the beginning.
[00:57:17.983 --> 00:57:24.209]  He probably went to parochial school for one month when we lived back in Missouri and when we moved back here.
[00:57:24.249 --> 00:57:27.012]  Okay, so some neighbor probably called you in.
[00:57:27.252 --> 00:57:27.513]  Yes.
[00:57:28.153 --> 00:57:28.714]  A piece of filth.
[00:57:28.734 --> 00:57:29.334]  Exactly what it is.
[00:57:29.455 --> 00:57:30.476]  Yeah, a piece of scumbag.
[00:57:30.716 --> 00:57:33.198]  So how do you, I mean, do you know a scumbag did it?
[00:57:33.579 --> 00:57:33.779]  Yes.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:49.592]  So this un-American piece of trash who needs to be kicked out of this country, think, see, see, because on sitcoms and dramas and movies, they imply it's abusive, and Bill Clinton has said it, Hillary said it, that it's abusive to not have your children in a government training camp.
[00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:51.414]  See, this is land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:57:51.754 --> 00:58:00.181]  And so this cowardly piece of filth called this scum on you, and so now they don't have any evidence of abuse, but they're going to try to get into your house now.
[00:58:00.642 --> 00:58:03.224]  Even if you sign the form, you're going to probably have CPS knock,
[00:58:03.944 --> 00:58:08.565]  If they see any dirt, any dog hair on the ground, any dishes, they will then come in force.
[00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:11.666]  Sometimes police will physically put their hands around your neck.
[00:58:12.407 --> 00:58:13.287]  Folks, this is standard.
[00:58:13.347 --> 00:58:15.327]  And squeeze until you sign forms.
[00:58:15.607 --> 00:58:21.849]  They will then grab your child, take them and hop them up on drugs when they cry wanting their mother, and you will enter a hell pit.
[00:58:22.269 --> 00:58:22.709]  Stay there.
[00:58:22.729 --> 00:58:24.490]  I'll try to advise you on the other side.
[00:58:25.342 --> 00:58:26.083]  And you will see.
[00:58:26.103 --> 00:58:27.704]  I'm not trying to terrorize you, man.
[00:58:27.724 --> 00:58:28.805]  They're going to terrorize you.
[00:58:29.025 --> 00:58:29.806]  There's a good chance.
[00:58:29.866 --> 00:58:31.867]  It's better to know that the enemy is coming.
[00:58:32.327 --> 00:58:32.628]  Okay?
[00:58:32.648 --> 00:58:34.009]  The four horsemen are coming.
[00:58:34.249 --> 00:58:36.651]  The enemy is coming to devour your family.
[00:58:38.512 --> 00:58:39.473]  You probably need to move.
[00:58:41.414 --> 00:58:46.058]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.032 --> 00:58:58.694]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.355 --> 00:59:00.398]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.119 --> 00:59:02.242]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.883 --> 00:59:03.685]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.467 --> 00:59:05.248]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.005 --> 00:59:09.648]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.188 --> 00:59:14.311]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.277 --> 00:59:25.118]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:59:25.198 --> 00:59:28.140]  Cuddly, surveilled, tattletale citizens everywhere.
[00:59:29.101 --> 00:59:33.984]  Mindless scum, and I mean scum, who think it's illegal to homeschool your children.
[00:59:35.445 --> 00:59:39.147]  All over the country, from Massachusetts to California to Illinois, they're the worst.
[00:59:39.667 --> 00:59:43.429]  They're now, without a law, trying to CPS homeschoolers.
[00:59:43.489 --> 00:59:48.271]  It's been all over the news, where they just come out and say, sorry, no teaching certificate, you can't teach.
[00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:49.812]  That's the next thing.
[00:59:49.832 --> 00:59:56.175]  It doesn't matter if homeschoolers statistically have the highest test scores or the cream of the crop, sought after by the Fortune 500.
[00:59:56.935 --> 00:59:58.636]  None of that matters.
[00:59:59.256 --> 01:00:04.899]  And as millions more exodus the prison training camps,
[01:00:06.613 --> 01:00:12.276]  You're going to see a backlash by the government training camps trying to force you back in.
[01:00:12.316 --> 01:00:15.018]  So this poor lady had a truancy officer show up.
[01:00:17.299 --> 01:00:21.601]  The mother, 11-year-old child, went and got the, quote, booklet from the school.
[01:00:21.862 --> 01:00:25.744]  It has one page, just a policy for homeschoolers.
[01:00:26.508 --> 01:00:28.089]  But it doesn't matter to this scum.
[01:00:28.169 --> 01:00:35.833]  They will have, through color of law, with no law, the truancy officer will then claim there's truant and then call in color of law CPS.
[01:00:36.193 --> 01:00:39.034]  Again, the total criminality of the state, folks.
[01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:40.295]  In your face.
[01:00:40.315 --> 01:00:42.356]  It's like they say there's a law you've got to take vaccines.
[01:00:42.776 --> 01:00:43.296]  No law.
[01:00:43.597 --> 01:00:47.619]  They take kids every day in this town where I live for this, okay?
[01:00:48.599 --> 01:00:50.440]  Thousands a year just where I live.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:50.580]  No law.
[01:00:51.601 --> 01:00:56.203]  Let me explain the ultra evil of that.
[01:00:56.747 --> 01:01:03.751]  I mean, you want prima facie, total evidence of massive coordinated strategia against you?
[01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:08.533]  Oh man, I'm so sick of women and children being harassed by these bullies.
[01:01:08.593 --> 01:01:14.096]  Every fiber in my gut just wants to wage war on them!
[01:01:14.136 --> 01:01:15.477]  We've got to wake the people up!
[01:01:15.997 --> 01:01:19.118]  And these brainwashed scum who just think their authority is God.
[01:01:19.399 --> 01:01:20.039]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:01:20.079 --> 01:01:23.921]  Let's go back to Kitty in New Hampshire.
[01:01:24.901 --> 01:01:27.562]  Kitty, I don't know your law there, but it's pretty much the same everywhere.
[01:01:27.582 --> 01:01:37.426]  And you said you went and got their, quote, law, and it's just policies of the school that see telling you, never had them in their system, what to do in New Hampshire.
[01:01:37.446 --> 01:01:38.206]  Please continue.
[01:01:38.687 --> 01:01:49.311]  Yeah, and one of the things it says that all these things are not required, like state assessment tests or any other particular assessment test,
[01:01:50.146 --> 01:01:53.269]  And SAUs, which I'm not even familiar what SAU is.
[01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:55.071]  Yeah, but let me guess.
[01:01:56.172 --> 01:02:04.221]  What did the truancy officer say when he came to your door and knocked on a law-abiding citizen's door where he has no business?
[01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:05.322]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:05.803 --> 01:02:12.770]  Well, other than the fact that he told me that I have to register my child with a school, he handed us this booklet.
[01:02:13.317 --> 01:02:15.057]  Which isn't a law!
[01:02:15.397 --> 01:02:16.218]  So now we know.
[01:02:16.438 --> 01:02:17.498]  It doesn't say it's the law.
[01:02:17.518 --> 01:02:19.418]  It says it's a policy, doesn't it?
[01:02:19.438 --> 01:02:21.439]  Yeah, it says rules.
[01:02:23.719 --> 01:02:29.900]  And the one page that they give you, it says common practices under home education law.
[01:02:30.821 --> 01:02:35.682]  Now, when I called the school district, I was told that evaluation is the law.
[01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:40.290]  I have to have it.
[01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:43.091]  But in the booklet itself it says you don't have to do it.
[01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:44.891]  Yes, the one page.
[01:02:46.492 --> 01:02:50.654]  But see, God on the other end has never read their own policies.
[01:02:50.694 --> 01:02:57.417]  They just tell these dumb cops, these stupid CPS workers, and they go out and do stuff that isn't even a law.
[01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.498]  They snatch kids every day that haven't had vaccines.
[01:03:00.698 --> 01:03:03.159]  There's no law, you criminal scum suckers!
[01:03:03.999 --> 01:03:05.780]  What is your major malfunction?
[01:03:06.761 --> 01:03:09.042]  And they think we're weird because we don't like this.
[01:03:09.483 --> 01:03:13.185]  Because we don't like them sticking their fat noses in our business.
[01:03:13.846 --> 01:03:16.287]  I don't want to get him in the school system, Alex.
[01:03:16.387 --> 01:03:20.190]  And I don't know, short of taking him to court, I don't know what to do.
[01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.611]  Well, did he threaten you?
[01:03:21.651 --> 01:03:22.592]  What did he say when he was there?
[01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:27.295]  He said that he only came up because...
[01:03:27.785 --> 01:03:30.227]  This woman had called in and reported him.
[01:03:30.528 --> 01:03:35.533]  So the only reason that he came out was because she keeps bothering him going, well, have you done anything?
[01:03:35.553 --> 01:03:38.676]  Yeah, and I bet she doesn't have kids.
[01:03:39.036 --> 01:03:41.739]  She's the mommy, though, at a subconscious level.
[01:03:41.779 --> 01:03:43.801]  She's jealous of you having children.
[01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:46.483]  She's some feminist leftist.
[01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:49.386]  And now she wants to be the mommy of your child.
[01:03:49.646 --> 01:03:52.209]  Hey, lady, you didn't carry him for nine months.
[01:03:56.704 --> 01:03:59.885]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:00.225 --> 01:04:02.165]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.525 --> 01:04:10.187]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:17.908]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:21.249]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:23.950]  The White House provoked to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:25.210]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.683 --> 01:04:26.423]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:26.443 --> 01:04:27.904]  Or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:53.724 --> 01:04:58.690]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:04.437]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:05:04.477 --> 01:05:08.762]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:05:09.082 --> 01:05:12.104]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:05:12.424 --> 01:05:15.867]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:05:16.187 --> 01:05:25.533]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Perky's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:05:25.793 --> 01:05:29.295]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:05:29.535 --> 01:05:36.640]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:53.541]  It's a fact.
[01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:58.184]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:05:58.624 --> 01:06:03.826]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:06:04.107 --> 01:06:07.308]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[01:06:07.568 --> 01:06:14.672]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:06:15.032 --> 01:06:22.236]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:06:22.656 --> 01:06:24.497]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:06:24.957 --> 01:06:31.220]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.061]  We're good to go.
[01:06:54.335 --> 01:06:56.557]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.117 --> 01:06:59.959]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:07.643 --> 01:07:11.906]  The new tyranny is going to be enforced against people who are totally law-abiding.
[01:07:13.006 --> 01:07:14.988]  They don't even need laws, do you understand?
[01:07:15.008 --> 01:07:20.651]  In Travis County, and it's the same all over the country, if you're arrested for no seatbelt...
[01:07:21.533 --> 01:07:24.715]  If you're arrested for a warrant from a no-seat-belt ticket, it doesn't matter.
[01:07:25.435 --> 01:07:31.719]  When you go to jail, they come to the jail cell and they say, just sign this, and you'll bond out yourself for free.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:44.407]  And people go, oh, because Americans are trained to be complete idiots, and they don't read the big four-page, triple-cut form, and you agree to nine, last time I checked, we're going to report on it, we've got CBS locally, too,
[01:07:45.802 --> 01:07:46.082]  I think.
[01:08:12.202 --> 01:08:13.302]  I mean, it was a big secret.
[01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:14.343]  They'd rough you up.
[01:08:14.403 --> 01:08:15.643]  They'd say, sign the form.
[01:08:16.023 --> 01:08:16.644]  Say you did it.
[01:08:16.664 --> 01:08:18.484]  Because, you know, Russians knew that was tyranny.
[01:08:19.445 --> 01:08:20.085]  Not Americans.
[01:08:20.145 --> 01:08:25.427]  Boy, you just give Americans a form and they just sign it.
[01:08:25.447 --> 01:08:28.228]  I remember one time I was in jail and they brought me a form.
[01:08:28.248 --> 01:08:28.768]  I didn't even read it.
[01:08:28.788 --> 01:08:29.708]  I said, I'm not going to sign anything.
[01:08:30.009 --> 01:08:33.530]  Then Mike Hanson went to jail because he wouldn't let him search his car without a warrant.
[01:08:35.851 --> 01:08:36.611]  That was when he walked out.
[01:08:36.651 --> 01:08:37.871]  I remember a Hollywood video.
[01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:40.813]  He called in live on a cell phone so everybody heard it on the radio.
[01:08:40.833 --> 01:08:41.813]  That was huge news.
[01:08:43.201 --> 01:08:45.502]  And he's walking out, and you know, the alarm goes off.
[01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:47.183]  He's wearing, it's summer, he's wearing shorts.
[01:08:47.504 --> 01:08:48.624]  I'm going to go back to you in a minute, Kitty.
[01:08:49.085 --> 01:08:49.465]  A shirt.
[01:08:50.065 --> 01:08:53.347]  He's got his little daughter, Crystal, now graduated from high school.
[01:08:53.687 --> 01:08:54.428]  She was little then.
[01:08:55.808 --> 01:08:56.789]  And the alarm goes off.
[01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:58.470]  They didn't de-scan the videotapes.
[01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.411]  And the manager says, go on out.
[01:09:00.491 --> 01:09:03.713]  Yeah, you know how they always do when it happens to you at the store or at the mall.
[01:09:04.593 --> 01:09:05.094]  Go on out.
[01:09:05.154 --> 01:09:05.834]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[01:09:06.995 --> 01:09:10.097]  And the security guard had seen Mike on TV.
[01:09:10.377 --> 01:09:12.238]  Mike used to be on the TV show at that point, and
[01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:15.256]  Was also running for office, getting ready to.
[01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:22.243]  And later, the county sheriff's deputy admitted he knew who Mike was.
[01:09:22.884 --> 01:09:23.865]  And he said, hey, stop.
[01:09:23.925 --> 01:09:24.605]  I'm going to search you.
[01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:26.107]  And Mike's car was parked right in front.
[01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:30.611]  And Mike said, hey, man, I got a couple of Disney videos here.
[01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:32.073]  I don't have anything on me.
[01:09:32.113 --> 01:09:32.854]  You heard the manager.
[01:09:33.074 --> 01:09:34.655]  The manager walks out and goes, yeah, that's fine.
[01:09:34.896 --> 01:09:36.177]  And the guy goes, no, I'm going to search you.
[01:09:37.757 --> 01:09:38.858]  And Mike said, no, you're not.
[01:09:38.878 --> 01:09:39.918]  He started getting in his car.
[01:09:39.938 --> 01:09:41.359]  Well, the guy reached in and grabbed on him.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:57.829]  So Mike pushed his hand off, rolled the window up, and Mike called into the show, and then the Ritters, same folks I was talking about earlier, the Ritters pull in, a lot of courage, got right in there with their video camera, got footage of it all, busting the window out on his daughter.
[01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:01.102]  And about midnight, we're all down there protesting.
[01:10:01.122 --> 01:10:01.942]  This is hours later.
[01:10:01.982 --> 01:10:03.423]  It happened about 7 o'clock at night.
[01:10:03.823 --> 01:10:06.164]  There's about 100 of us out protesting outside the jail.
[01:10:06.684 --> 01:10:07.964]  And Mike calls me on the cell phone.
[01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:08.685]  His one phone call.
[01:10:08.725 --> 01:10:11.246]  And he goes, listen, they've been torturing me.
[01:10:11.306 --> 01:10:13.086]  They're trying to force me to sign a document.
[01:10:14.207 --> 01:10:16.648]  It says that I'm guilty of all these crimes.
[01:10:17.208 --> 01:10:19.029]  And frankly, I thought Mike had gone crazy.
[01:10:19.129 --> 01:10:19.829]  I was ignorant.
[01:10:20.069 --> 01:10:21.930]  I guess this was about nine years ago.
[01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:23.470]  What was this, like 98, 97?
[01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:24.511]  I thought Mike...
[01:10:28.396 --> 01:10:30.258]  I was lying, and I didn't know Mike would be a liar.
[01:10:30.298 --> 01:10:32.459]  I was naive, folks.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.823]  They wouldn't let the big protest upstairs, but they'd let people individually in.
[01:10:36.863 --> 01:10:49.473]  So I went in up to the big glass window, and I'm talking to the jail guard, one of the people there, and I said, yeah, Mike was just telling me that you gave him something called a personal bond, but can I see one of those?
[01:10:49.533 --> 01:10:50.834]  And she said, sure, have one.
[01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:53.796]  And I turned it over.
[01:10:55.599 --> 01:11:00.523]  And it said that anyone who signed it had committed all these crimes.
[01:11:02.004 --> 01:11:07.588]  And agreed to a further judification to take, we calculated, it was like over $3,000 in classes.
[01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:12.152]  And then you're on probation for six months.
[01:11:13.513 --> 01:11:16.736]  But then you've got to pay all, and then go into the system.
[01:11:18.657 --> 01:11:22.420]  Drunk driving, robbery, family violence.
[01:11:23.524 --> 01:11:25.085]  I mean, it was nine different things.
[01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:28.426]  And so we covered it on the TV show, CBS, then had a local newscast.
[01:11:28.446 --> 01:11:32.508]  We've got somewhere in the archives where they say, think you're innocent until proven guilty?
[01:11:32.768 --> 01:11:33.808]  Not in Travis County.
[01:11:33.828 --> 01:11:35.289]  You're guilty until proven innocent.
[01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:44.593]  You see, in America, we're so brainwashed, the cops, the jailers, everybody, that they think that's normal.
[01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:48.705]  Oh, and I forgot the part about Mike said, listen, they've been torturing me.
[01:11:48.725 --> 01:11:51.808]  They're trying to force me to sign documents and some personal reconnaissance bond.
[01:11:51.828 --> 01:11:52.249]  I won't do it.
[01:11:52.509 --> 01:11:53.069]  No, please!
[01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:59.555]  And then Mike later gets out and says they choked him, they stomped him, they did pressure points.
[01:12:00.356 --> 01:12:04.200]  Then he does a Freedom of Information Act request, gets the video.
[01:12:05.057 --> 01:12:15.291]  And they're so arrogant, he shows him on the phone in the hall, they hear him, and they're all around him, three of them, and they all start putting their hands around his neck on his body, and the tape cuts out and goes black.
[01:12:15.651 --> 01:12:20.338]  They gave him the whole shift, hours of video, right there for about three minutes it goes black.
[01:12:23.463 --> 01:12:27.464]  We've got to get that tape and put that on TV again and just show people.
[01:12:27.664 --> 01:12:29.884]  So literally, I'm on the phone and he's saying he's being tortured.
[01:12:30.124 --> 01:12:31.685]  He's saying they're trying to force me to sign documents.
[01:12:31.725 --> 01:12:34.165]  And I hear, no, no, no, not again.
[01:12:34.825 --> 01:12:37.346]  This is what's going on in America.
[01:12:37.926 --> 01:12:39.106]  I didn't believe it.
[01:12:39.426 --> 01:12:41.426]  Later I saw the video.
[01:12:41.886 --> 01:12:43.727]  They didn't cut it 30 seconds before it started.
[01:12:43.887 --> 01:12:44.747]  They're so arrogant.
[01:12:44.987 --> 01:12:49.148]  It shows them putting their hands on him and one putting their hands around his neck and then it goes black.
[01:12:49.568 --> 01:12:51.168]  That is America.
[01:12:53.832 --> 01:12:55.593]  That's who these people are.
[01:12:55.753 --> 01:12:59.595]  They're enemies of this country, and I'm tired of everybody kissing up to them.
[01:13:02.096 --> 01:13:04.958]  They come take people's kids when there's no law to take a vaccine.
[01:13:05.278 --> 01:13:08.340]  They come take their kids when there's no law to enroll them in the school system.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:15.984]  They come and they engage in criminal activities with force of arms in a concerted, organized syndicate.
[01:13:18.815 --> 01:13:20.675]  And I'm tired of kissing up to the whole system.
[01:13:20.735 --> 01:13:21.596]  It's all criminal.
[01:13:21.676 --> 01:13:28.557]  Individuals may not be criminal within it, but the system is completely bankrupt, completely reprobate, completely evil.
[01:13:29.377 --> 01:13:30.958]  Just like it's been in every other society.
[01:13:31.838 --> 01:13:35.639]  Freedom was an incredibly rare thing, folks, and it's going down the toilet right now.
[01:13:37.519 --> 01:13:38.439]  It's going down the drain.
[01:13:38.459 --> 01:13:43.020]  The last bits of freedom are draining down the drain right now.
[01:13:43.641 --> 01:13:45.141]  And you need to get mad about this.
[01:13:49.733 --> 01:13:50.354]  I mean, how?
[01:13:50.895 --> 01:13:57.126]  I mean, dirty Soviets knew it was bad and knew it was evil and knew to hide it and get it in subterranean pits.
[01:13:58.949 --> 01:14:00.572]  They normally did the torture underneath the jails.
[01:14:00.592 --> 01:14:01.313]  They had a facility.
[01:14:01.334 --> 01:14:02.596]  It goes back to the Tsarist Russia.
[01:14:03.889 --> 01:14:05.391]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote about it.
[01:14:05.671 --> 01:14:06.211]  Not anymore.
[01:14:06.271 --> 01:14:07.272]  Not in America, man.
[01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:13.739]  They had the city and county officials on TV going, of course we have them sign this.
[01:14:13.919 --> 01:14:19.825]  I mean, you people just make me sick.
[01:14:21.466 --> 01:14:22.908]  Now, it sounds like this truancy officer...
[01:14:23.954 --> 01:14:25.254]  It isn't that bad of a person.
[01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:28.335]  He says, man, one reason I'm here is your neighbor.
[01:14:28.835 --> 01:14:29.836]  It's the law.
[01:14:29.896 --> 01:14:31.596]  And then here's the booklet from the school.
[01:14:31.836 --> 01:14:32.356]  The school!
[01:14:32.516 --> 01:14:34.297]  Some woman who's never had her kid in his system.
[01:14:34.577 --> 01:14:35.717]  He's 11 years old.
[01:14:36.557 --> 01:14:36.937]  That's what?
[01:14:37.118 --> 01:14:38.138]  Five years of school.
[01:14:38.658 --> 01:14:39.758]  Never been in their system.
[01:14:40.818 --> 01:14:42.859]  Had him in in kindergarten, as she said earlier.
[01:14:43.699 --> 01:14:48.020]  Earlier in, I guess for a half a year, I think she said.
[01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:50.241]  She lives in a new state.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:53.001]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:14:53.101 --> 01:14:55.063]  Just tell the story, and then I'll try to advise you.
[01:14:55.704 --> 01:14:57.085]  I'm sorry it gets me so upset.
[01:14:57.165 --> 01:14:59.567]  It's just shame on you.
[01:14:59.987 --> 01:15:04.011]  People in government ought to be ashamed of themselves until all this behavior is extincted.
[01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:04.971]  But it isn't going away.
[01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:05.592]  It's getting worse.
[01:15:06.192 --> 01:15:07.914]  Kitty in New Hampshire finished up your story.
[01:15:08.034 --> 01:15:09.595]  Tell me what happened when he came to the door.
[01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:10.056]  What was said?
[01:15:10.096 --> 01:15:10.496]  What happened?
[01:15:10.856 --> 01:15:17.522]  Well, he told me that I had to register him with a school, whether it be the state or the district.
[01:15:18.078 --> 01:15:24.522]  Now, when I called Charlotte Isabet to ask her for advice, she said, you don't want him in the district.
[01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:25.722]  You want him in the state.
[01:15:26.403 --> 01:15:36.569]  Now, the state, when I called, they're telling me that I have to refer back to where I am.
[01:15:37.109 --> 01:15:41.912]  Now, this goes back to this John Cruikshank, who is the truant officer.
[01:15:43.093 --> 01:15:47.215]  And they are the ones that, when I called them yesterday,
[01:15:47.637 --> 01:15:47.777]  Right.
[01:15:47.797 --> 01:15:48.418]  It's just rules.
[01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:19.874]  And now I'm thinking that the only way I'm going to get them off my back now is to take them to court.
[01:16:21.415 --> 01:16:23.516]  Well, no, you don't want to get entangled with these people.
[01:16:25.637 --> 01:16:26.598]  Do you rent your house?
[01:16:27.078 --> 01:16:28.799]  Yes, I rent an apartment.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:35.944]  Okay, can't you just move out of the county to a county right next door and even still work at the same place?
[01:16:38.005 --> 01:16:41.327]  I could, but it would be... We just moved in here.
[01:16:42.293 --> 01:16:44.474]  And we have already spent so much money.
[01:16:44.535 --> 01:16:45.335]  No, I understand.
[01:16:45.355 --> 01:16:56.842]  The first thing you need to do is get together with family, whatever, and you need to nicely let this neighbor know that false charges, you know, claiming some type of neglect or something, is a serious civil penalty.
[01:16:56.882 --> 01:16:58.584]  It's also a serious criminal penalty.
[01:16:59.044 --> 01:17:04.908]  And that you're strongly considering following that if you ever get any more of her behavior.
[01:17:05.108 --> 01:17:06.429]  That it's your right to homeschool.
[01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:08.090]  And I would do it written.
[01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:11.472]  Don't do it with this mindless peon to her scumbag face.
[01:17:13.022 --> 01:17:14.083]  How do I handle this?
[01:17:14.143 --> 01:17:15.763]  John, truant officer.
[01:17:16.503 --> 01:17:17.264]  Okay, what did he say?
[01:17:17.284 --> 01:17:19.484]  Did he say, I'm going to come back and take your kid if you don't do this?
[01:17:20.225 --> 01:17:20.485]  No.
[01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:22.806]  What did he say?
[01:17:22.946 --> 01:17:35.790]  He handed us all these forms and these pieces of paper, and when you read all this paperwork, this one page that deals with the homeschooling says, I don't have to do any of this stuff.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:48.247]  But now, at the same time, this other paper that they give you, they want you to circle whether it goes grades 1 through 5 or grades 6 through 12.
[01:17:48.487 --> 01:17:50.608]  And they want you to fill this out.
[01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:54.751]  And it's got all the child's name, date of birth, address, all this.
[01:17:55.771 --> 01:18:02.155]  And it goes back into the evaluation.
[01:18:03.777 --> 01:18:06.760]  And it will be done because it is the law.
[01:18:09.103 --> 01:18:12.846]  Well, I'll tell you what they do in some of the states like California where they are forcing these evaluations.
[01:18:12.906 --> 01:18:14.608]  I don't know if the law has changed in New Hampshire.
[01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:20.494]  CPS is there and does an interrogation trying to slip your kid up.
[01:18:20.514 --> 01:18:22.997]  You've got to teach your children, folks, not to talk.
[01:18:23.057 --> 01:18:24.038]  People in uniforms...
[01:18:25.157 --> 01:18:30.200]  You need to let them know, statistically, are the most dangerous individuals they will ever come in contact with.
[01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:33.002]  And people with clipboards, the system, whatever.
[01:18:33.262 --> 01:18:35.984]  Just like you teach your children not to talk to strangers or bandits.
[01:18:37.565 --> 01:18:40.787]  Or, you know, if they see a grizzly bear, run the other direction.
[01:18:41.648 --> 01:18:42.488]  Stay there, my dear.
[01:18:42.608 --> 01:18:44.409]  It makes me so mad to see a woman cornered.
[01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:50.133]  I just want to... God, I hope you curse every one of these people.
[01:18:55.154 --> 01:18:57.476]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:58.817]  The real money folks.

[01:19:07.023 --> 01:19:07.443]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:10.405]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:13.667]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:19:23.376 --> 01:19:28.977]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.597 --> 01:19:32.618]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:20:54.664 --> 01:20:57.106]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.126 --> 01:21:04.510]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:14.875]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[01:21:15.575 --> 01:21:21.759]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[01:21:22.479 --> 01:21:30.161]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:47.813 --> 01:22:50.315]  Once again, wristease.com.
[01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:16.511]  Back when this country had log cabin education, we had better industry, better presidents, better leaders.
[01:23:17.332 --> 01:23:19.934]  Many of our presidents were raised at home, taught at home.
[01:23:21.636 --> 01:23:21.776]  Period.
[01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:21.976]  Period.
[01:23:46.144 --> 01:23:46.564]  We're good to go.
[01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:47.065]  We're good to go.
[01:24:14.548 --> 01:24:15.228]  Well, she used to be a neighbor.
[01:24:15.248 --> 01:24:15.668]  She has a son.
[01:24:43.837 --> 01:24:44.918]  She's on welfare.
[01:24:46.199 --> 01:24:48.441]  Oh, she's in the system and managed by CPS.
[01:24:48.681 --> 01:24:51.243]  Oh, they're the worst, so they think this is part of the system.
[01:24:51.303 --> 01:24:51.563]  Okay.
[01:24:51.903 --> 01:24:52.143]  Yes.
[01:24:52.404 --> 01:24:56.607]  They'll probably give her brownie points and tell her they won't take her kid and give her little goodies.
[01:24:56.867 --> 01:24:58.949]  She's probably getting kickbacks for every child snatched.
[01:24:59.049 --> 01:24:59.749]  Okay, now I see.
[01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:13.560]  Well, we tried to give my son the idea of two sides to the railroad, and we wanted him to see what the other side of the railroad looked like.
[01:25:14.754 --> 01:25:24.976]  And it ended up being that she, because I ended up telling this boy that I thought it was in the best interest for my son if he didn't come over anymore.
[01:25:26.237 --> 01:25:29.017]  Oh, you don't want your son with this white trash scum.
[01:25:29.277 --> 01:25:32.118]  Yes, and that was when the trouble started.
[01:25:33.558 --> 01:25:36.299]  No, see, it's always, and that's how Nazi Germany was.
[01:25:36.619 --> 01:25:37.919]  That's how America now is.
[01:25:38.339 --> 01:25:40.340]  It's all about vindictiveness.
[01:25:41.138 --> 01:25:54.565]  And so this welfare trash, she is total scum, does nothing but watch television, where on all the dramas and sitcoms and Saving Amy and all this stuff, they tell you on TV homeschooling is illegal.
[01:25:54.765 --> 01:25:55.766]  You can see it all over TV.
[01:25:56.006 --> 01:25:58.107]  They imply it's illegal or that you're all abusive.
[01:25:58.427 --> 01:26:00.008]  And so she ratted you out.
[01:26:00.308 --> 01:26:02.329]  Well, you let that white trash know in a letter.
[01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:04.630]  I would do this.
[01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:05.571]  I'm not saying you should do this.
[01:26:05.591 --> 01:26:06.251]  You do what you want.
[01:26:06.591 --> 01:26:09.733]  You let that white trash know that...
[01:26:10.959 --> 01:26:21.085]  That if there are any more reports, any more false reports, that that is civil and criminal, that you're going to file suit against her, that you need to send her.
[01:26:21.105 --> 01:26:22.066]  She's so ignorant.
[01:26:22.406 --> 01:26:26.669]  Go to Google, print off mainstream news articles about some headline.
[01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:29.450]  You can just type in, more and more Americans homeschooling.
[01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:31.972]  Circle it and say, see, it's not illegal.
[01:26:33.172 --> 01:26:34.733]  Be very mechanical in the letter.
[01:26:34.793 --> 01:26:35.514]  No insults.
[01:26:36.269 --> 01:26:37.970]  Though I know it would be proper to.
[01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:54.602]  And just say that this is horrible what she's done and trying to get you into the system and that if there's any more false reports that you're going to probably do something civil.
[01:26:55.083 --> 01:27:00.807]  My husband has asked this John if he wanted to go on the air with you.
[01:27:02.407 --> 01:27:03.547]  And he said no.
[01:27:04.588 --> 01:27:07.748]  Oh, that's very good to let them know you're in contact with the media.
[01:27:07.788 --> 01:27:10.009]  Did he get very respectful after that?
[01:27:10.489 --> 01:27:10.729]  Yes.
[01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:11.950]  Oh, good.
[01:27:12.150 --> 01:27:13.810]  He was very hesitant about it.
[01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:18.671]  We still have some tiny bit of groveling power against you.
[01:27:18.891 --> 01:27:24.173]  We still have some weapons, though they're meek, against your abuse and your tyranny.
[01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:25.013]  Yes.
[01:27:26.657 --> 01:27:29.918]  I'd love you to come down here and go after them, Alex.
[01:27:30.659 --> 01:27:31.559]  I mean, I'm ready to cry.
[01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.941]  Unfortunately, we get hundreds of calls off air every week.
[01:27:34.501 --> 01:27:36.902]  I mean, you ought to see the stuff that's going on, ma'am.
[01:27:37.123 --> 01:27:46.048]  Look, I've been at the hospitals covering it when they choke women into signing forms to hand over newborn babies that are sold to the adoption agencies for a quarter of a mil.
[01:27:46.968 --> 01:27:49.510]  Okay, I mean, I've seen hells you can't imagine, ma'am.
[01:27:50.177 --> 01:27:51.497]  I mean, what you're in is nothing.
[01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:52.498]  You want to stay out of it.
[01:27:52.998 --> 01:27:58.919]  You want to go down and you want to search New Hampshire truancy laws, New Hampshire homeschooling laws.
[01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:02.040]  There are homeschool advocacy groups that are the real experts.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:03.260]  You know what?
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.660]  I'm going to give you my office number.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.781]  Kevin's out right now.
[01:28:06.421 --> 01:28:07.361]  Erin's out right now.
[01:28:07.421 --> 01:28:08.281]  They're off doing business.
[01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:14.283]  But I will, in your case, we've got some names because we give them out all the time, of good groups.
[01:28:14.343 --> 01:28:18.084]  And I'll put you in contact with real experts who can advise you, okay?
[01:28:18.284 --> 01:28:19.664]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:28:19.904 --> 01:28:20.284]  Thank you.
[01:28:20.304 --> 01:28:28.947]  I'm going to put you on hold, and we're going to give you my office number, and call, and Kevin will try to get back with you.
[01:28:29.507 --> 01:28:30.888]  We can't get back with everybody, folks.
[01:28:31.048 --> 01:28:35.029]  That's why you should support us and buy the books and videos, because I could then hire more employees.
[01:28:35.429 --> 01:28:42.451]  We spend most of our time, frankly, doing this now, and then we can't film make, we can't get anything done, but you've got to help people.
[01:28:43.992 --> 01:28:44.912]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.392 --> 01:28:46.893]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.902 --> 01:28:50.683]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.785 --> 01:28:59.907]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:29:00.147 --> 01:29:01.908]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:02.168 --> 01:29:08.451]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.751 --> 01:29:14.873]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:15.113 --> 01:29:16.954]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:29:17.014 --> 01:29:17.655]  We're good to go.
[01:29:39.531 --> 01:29:39.731]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:39.751 --> 01:29:39.811]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:58.206]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:29:58.406 --> 01:30:02.870]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[01:30:17.285 --> 01:30:36.490]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:40.311]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:30:40.471 --> 01:30:43.132]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:49.694]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:50.315 --> 01:30:51.735]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.196 --> 01:30:57.237]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:57.457 --> 01:31:00.859]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:01.019 --> 01:31:04.460]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:04.767 --> 01:31:08.010]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:13.495]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:13.535 --> 01:31:23.164]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:23.304 --> 01:31:24.645]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:31:24.685 --> 01:31:30.090]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:30.567 --> 01:31:35.012]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:35.092 --> 01:31:36.473]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:36.633 --> 01:31:40.457]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:40.557 --> 01:31:41.378]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:32:07.507 --> 01:32:08.689]  We're good to go.
[01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:27.274]  Yeah.
[01:32:27.354 --> 01:32:28.875]  That's exactly what I hope.
[01:32:28.915 --> 01:32:33.096]  Help us get the message in the bottles.
[01:32:33.176 --> 01:32:39.699]  Millions of us every day are throwing more bottles with messages into the sieve.
[01:32:54.904 --> 01:33:01.366]  To go to faraway lands or sometimes they wash up just down the shore and somebody else picks them up more often than not.
[01:33:01.726 --> 01:33:02.807]  We're having an effect.
[01:33:02.847 --> 01:33:15.671]  Please tell everybody you know, every day, your email list, message boards, your MySpace account, folks at work, aboutinfowars.com, aboutinfowars.net, aboutjonesreport.com.
[01:33:16.651 --> 01:33:17.171]  Help us.
[01:33:17.451 --> 01:33:21.752]  Tell people about Terror Storm for free on Google Video.
[01:33:22.933 --> 01:33:23.253]  For free!
[01:33:24.645 --> 01:33:25.065]  Help us.
[01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:26.887]  Get the word out to the people.
[01:33:28.788 --> 01:33:33.351]  I mean, when you see the abuse of innocence, it's my instinctive need to fight them.
[01:33:33.472 --> 01:33:38.595]  And I can't believe how bad things are, but we've been incrementally brought into this so we're not aware of it.
[01:33:38.615 --> 01:33:40.597]  It's the old frog in the pot of water.
[01:33:40.617 --> 01:33:41.898]  You turn up slow, it boils.
[01:33:42.098 --> 01:33:44.340]  If you were to throw it in scalding water, it'd jump right out.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.901]  And right now, it's boiling, folks.
[01:33:46.941 --> 01:33:48.783]  The eyes are rolling back in the head of the frog.
[01:33:50.084 --> 01:33:53.026]  And I think about the things they do to innocent women like this lady and
[01:33:53.948 --> 01:33:56.090]  But ma'am, I don't want you to be too paranoid in the system.
[01:33:56.110 --> 01:33:58.412]  A lot of times they'll come out and won't come back out again.
[01:33:59.293 --> 01:34:03.496]  Your big problem is going to be this lady, but if she doesn't still live by you, that's a lot better.
[01:34:03.516 --> 01:34:06.499]  And it may just kind of blow over and go away.
[01:34:06.539 --> 01:34:09.081]  If somebody does knock on your door, do not answer it.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:17.205]  Get advice from the different homeschooling groups that we can put you in contact with.
[01:34:17.666 --> 01:34:20.808]  If you've got a computer, if not, go to the library.
[01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:22.770]  Take five hours if it takes it.
[01:34:23.150 --> 01:34:28.375]  It would take me two minutes, but once you learn how to use this stuff, get the New Hampshire laws and have that.
[01:34:29.361 --> 01:34:35.563]  And if you ever get confronted, the problem is these thugs, especially the CPS workers, don't like to hear their wrongs.
[01:34:35.623 --> 01:34:40.145]  A lot of times you show them laws and argue with them, it totally freaks them out because they have a lot of guilt.
[01:34:41.045 --> 01:34:42.025]  And they just go nuts.
[01:34:43.005 --> 01:34:45.366]  I mean, you're being not, this is like a stick-up.
[01:34:45.386 --> 01:34:46.166]  They're just criminals.
[01:34:46.767 --> 01:34:50.168]  Now, it sounds like this truancy officer isn't, probably doesn't like abusing people.
[01:34:50.468 --> 01:34:51.908]  A lot of people in the system are good.
[01:34:52.228 --> 01:34:56.990]  Just because they're five times more likely to be abusive, that's still a low number of them are.
[01:34:58.309 --> 01:35:00.491]  But the law itself is criminal.
[01:35:01.132 --> 01:35:02.032]  The law itself.
[01:35:02.913 --> 01:35:04.094]  Well, again, it isn't even a law.
[01:35:04.154 --> 01:35:06.636]  But the things they do.
[01:35:08.278 --> 01:35:09.198]  It's all color of law.
[01:35:09.218 --> 01:35:10.439]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:35:10.499 --> 01:35:13.082]  It's just that I want to be able to warn more people.
[01:35:14.002 --> 01:35:15.624]  I want more AM and FM affiliates.
[01:35:16.524 --> 01:35:18.466]  I want more people listening on the Internet.
[01:35:18.586 --> 01:35:20.127]  I want more people listening on Shortwave.
[01:35:20.167 --> 01:35:25.352]  I want more people to get Terror Storm and to make copies of it on DVD aggressively.
[01:35:26.869 --> 01:35:28.611]  I want you to support us.
[01:35:28.972 --> 01:35:31.475]  Because everything we do is about fighting the globalists.
[01:35:32.155 --> 01:35:44.690]  And I just have such a desire, a burning passion, to overturn these people, to punish them, and to defend the weak, to defend the ignorant.
[01:35:45.507 --> 01:35:46.728]  And we're all ignorant.
[01:35:46.848 --> 01:35:47.308]  I'm ignorant.
[01:35:47.348 --> 01:35:48.289]  I'm learning more every day.
[01:35:48.749 --> 01:35:51.611]  I didn't know they tortured people in the Travis County Jail.
[01:35:51.972 --> 01:35:58.616]  I didn't know they tried to force everybody by threats to sign documents waiving all their rights and agreeing to crimes they weren't even arrested for.
[01:35:58.636 --> 01:36:06.321]  I didn't know that... I mean, I used to laugh even ten years ago that fluoride was poisonous until I read all the university studies.
[01:36:07.402 --> 01:36:08.423]  I didn't know all this.
[01:36:08.543 --> 01:36:11.165]  It's hard to believe how bad it is.
[01:36:11.934 --> 01:36:13.315]  But you can find, and I'm going to your calls.
[01:36:13.335 --> 01:36:16.116]  I'm going to Heavy and David and Johnny and John and Chris right now.
[01:36:17.017 --> 01:36:21.159]  But I didn't know just how bad it was.
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.121]  I mean, we live in this every day.
[01:36:24.521 --> 01:36:25.201]  We don't know.
[01:36:26.642 --> 01:36:39.309]  And the more I find out, it's just a lot of people who live overseas or Americans who've lived overseas or travel, who've been to dictatorships, say that America in many respects is worse than
[01:36:43.334 --> 01:36:47.575]  It's just people don't realize it because it's normalized and because we don't communicate.
[01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:57.239]  Folks used to meet, you know, at the end of the street every night and, you know, cook hamburgers or talk or go on camping trips together or church, and people didn't watch TV.
[01:36:57.639 --> 01:37:00.320]  They communicated, and if somebody did that, people would flip out.
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:01.980]  We have been gelded.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.161]  We have been domesticated.
[01:37:04.181 --> 01:37:06.902]  Let's go to Heavy in California, holding like a real trooper.
[01:37:06.942 --> 01:37:07.222]  Thank you.
[01:37:07.242 --> 01:37:08.102]  Now we're going to move quickly.
[01:37:08.142 --> 01:37:08.643]  Go ahead, Heavy.
[01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:10.543]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:10.643 --> 01:37:12.704]  Prison Planet TV member for over a year.
[01:37:13.473 --> 01:37:22.117]  For the past day, I've been wondering whether you're trying to see how awake we are or if you're a shill for the New World Order.
[01:37:22.697 --> 01:37:31.581]  Because I've been irritated by the fact I'm trying to figure out why you posted the Oklahoma City Timothy McVeigh story.
[01:37:31.961 --> 01:37:34.302]  It's clearly not McVeigh in the picture.
[01:37:36.866 --> 01:37:38.467]  Well, I disagree with you.
[01:37:38.507 --> 01:37:43.110]  I mean, I'm not 100% sure, but I checked with a professor.
[01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:45.232]  I mean, I read over all the documents.
[01:37:45.252 --> 01:37:47.213]  I mean, have you read the accompanying documentation?
[01:37:47.673 --> 01:37:50.955]  Yes, and others have, too, including editors.
[01:37:51.015 --> 01:37:53.137]  We searched it, and there's pretty much nothing.
[01:37:54.197 --> 01:37:55.818]  And, I mean, this is serious business.
[01:37:55.858 --> 01:37:59.361]  I mean, we can't look like a National Enquirer tabloid.
[01:38:00.607 --> 01:38:02.108]  Okay, well, give me evidence.
[01:38:02.128 --> 01:38:03.409]  You searched something.
[01:38:03.529 --> 01:38:05.990]  We're asking you for evidence, more evidence.
[01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:08.311]  No, no, no, you just said you had evidence it wasn't him.
[01:38:08.371 --> 01:38:09.252]  I mean, tell me.
[01:38:09.972 --> 01:38:12.194]  The picture, it's clearly not McVeigh.
[01:38:12.214 --> 01:38:18.117]  I mean, I can look at WTC 7 and clearly know without anything that it's a controlled demolition.
[01:38:18.823 --> 01:38:20.164]  Just like I can look at this picture.
[01:38:20.224 --> 01:38:21.165]  It's not McVeigh.
[01:38:21.605 --> 01:38:24.207]  Well, I mean, your evidence is everybody's saying it isn't him.
[01:38:24.307 --> 01:38:33.372]  Actually, most people that have emailed us or what I've seen posted say, number one, this is McVeigh years younger than when you first see him on the scene.
[01:38:33.873 --> 01:38:34.873]  The teeth are the same.
[01:38:34.953 --> 01:38:35.874]  The eyes are the same.
[01:38:35.914 --> 01:38:36.975]  The eyebrows are the same.
[01:38:37.295 --> 01:38:38.416]  The voice is the same.
[01:38:40.397 --> 01:38:43.139]  So, and I mean, you're sitting here.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:46.061]  You know, saying, first you claim you had evidence.
[01:38:46.081 --> 01:38:47.062]  You said, we've searched it.
[01:38:47.942 --> 01:38:50.904]  And our editors, what does that word editors mean?
[01:38:51.565 --> 01:38:53.005]  It's a serious claim, Alex.
[01:38:53.045 --> 01:38:55.147]  No, no, no, you're saying editors.
[01:38:55.507 --> 01:38:57.828]  I googled Bill Bean and there's absolutely nothing.
[01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:01.150]  What does that mean?
[01:39:01.711 --> 01:39:02.291]  What does it mean?
[01:39:02.311 --> 01:39:02.651]  I don't know.
[01:39:02.671 --> 01:39:03.612]  Maybe we need more.
[01:39:03.712 --> 01:39:04.672]  Can you give us more?
[01:39:04.692 --> 01:39:06.313]  Because it's a serious accusation.
[01:39:07.034 --> 01:39:07.914]  I mean, it's evidence.
[01:39:08.535 --> 01:39:10.836]  You know, we already know that all this is happening.
[01:39:11.667 --> 01:39:15.451]  But, I mean, we can't become the National Enquirer, is what I'm saying.
[01:39:15.552 --> 01:39:19.236]  Yeah, kind of like I was the National Enquirer when I told you they were building FEMA camps.
[01:39:19.676 --> 01:39:20.177]  Not at all.
[01:39:20.477 --> 01:39:29.308]  I always got accused of that, or I was the National Enquirer about North American Union, or one day after it passed, we got the bill, and I said it does affect U.S.
[01:39:29.348 --> 01:39:30.569]  citizens, H.R. 6166.
[01:39:32.432 --> 01:39:34.813]  And then people all over said, oh, no, it doesn't say that.
[01:39:34.873 --> 01:39:35.673]  I can't find it.
[01:39:35.993 --> 01:39:38.034]  It says early in the bill it doesn't affect citizens.
[01:39:38.234 --> 01:39:48.778]  But then I've had a train of legal experts and top scholars on and all these big university law professor heads breaking down the exact subsections of U.S.
[01:39:48.838 --> 01:39:50.899]  code where it does say U.S.
[01:39:50.939 --> 01:39:51.519]  citizens.
[01:39:52.759 --> 01:39:55.000]  And certainly I do make mistakes.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.181]  We're wrong from time to time.
[01:39:56.481 --> 01:39:58.262]  If you're looking for somebody who's 100%,
[01:39:59.862 --> 01:40:03.623]  The last time that happened was with Jesus Christ, and I'm certainly not Jesus Christ.
[01:40:03.723 --> 01:40:04.003]  Right.
[01:40:04.324 --> 01:40:07.025]  So... Can I give you a quote?
[01:40:07.745 --> 01:40:07.985]  Okay.
[01:40:08.425 --> 01:40:13.287]  From the Time for Decision, 1944, government official Sumner Wells.
[01:40:14.147 --> 01:40:22.530]  He goes on to say, quote, When the right time comes, stimulate internal dissension sufficiently to destroy the morale of the people.
[01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:29.132]  Now, knowingly or unknowingly, we all could be contributing to their plan
[01:40:29.653 --> 01:40:32.934]  So what I'm saying is you've taught us well, Alex.
[01:40:33.354 --> 01:40:35.996]  Search, dig, question sources.
[01:40:36.276 --> 01:40:41.058]  The truth can be used as propaganda to destroy morale.
[01:40:41.378 --> 01:40:41.658]  Yeah.
[01:40:42.438 --> 01:40:47.280]  Well, one could say what you're doing now is one of the better examples of that.
[01:40:49.281 --> 01:40:49.501]  Alex.
[01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:51.205]  I'm a believer.
[01:40:51.625 --> 01:40:51.825]  Yeah.
[01:40:52.265 --> 01:40:55.128]  Well, number one, I've never asked anybody to believe in me.
[01:40:55.188 --> 01:40:56.409]  I've always said the opposite.
[01:40:56.729 --> 01:40:58.010]  I'm not your leader.
[01:40:58.130 --> 01:40:59.011]  I'm not your leader.
[01:40:59.131 --> 01:41:00.912]  I don't claim to be pure as a driven snow.
[01:41:01.292 --> 01:41:02.934]  I don't claim to be some perfect saint.
[01:41:03.354 --> 01:41:04.275]  I am legitimate.
[01:41:04.655 --> 01:41:05.836]  What I do is legitimate.
[01:41:07.017 --> 01:41:09.019]  I am doing my best to tell the truth.
[01:41:09.439 --> 01:41:13.462]  I am doing my best to reach out to people, and I appreciate your call.
[01:41:14.323 --> 01:41:18.466]  I've also said many, many times here on air,
[01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:24.581]  That 9-11 was probably meant to come out to a certain extent.
[01:41:24.621 --> 01:41:25.584]  Just like JFK.
[01:41:25.624 --> 01:41:28.913]  They did that sloppy so people in the know would know.
[01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:56.345]  And I've said many times that if we just sit here and blame George Bush for 9-11, and we act like George Bush and the neocons are the final arbiters and the final people, and if we don't expose the fact that European Union owners own this country and are using us as their front, their engine to go dominate the world, and then we take the blame, it's like Rupert Murdoch demonizes us in his newspapers and TV overseas, but then builds us up and tells us to go along with the war here domestically.
[01:41:56.805 --> 01:41:58.446]  That's a clear sign right there.
[01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:02.502]  Everything they do is to destroy the family on their TV shows.
[01:42:02.962 --> 01:42:04.123]  You know, the worst programs.
[01:42:04.303 --> 01:42:04.763]  All of that.
[01:42:04.783 --> 01:42:05.483]  Look at the fruits.
[01:42:08.384 --> 01:42:12.986]  Conversely, I'm telling you, I mean, do you hear me talking about Barack Obama and Hillary all day?
[01:42:13.046 --> 01:42:14.127]  No, I say that's a diversion.
[01:42:14.147 --> 01:42:14.867]  They're all puppets.
[01:42:15.207 --> 01:42:19.689]  We get 8% turnout at the local level, 50-something percent nationally.
[01:42:20.735 --> 01:42:22.516]  Depending on the year, between 50% and 60%.
[01:42:23.617 --> 01:42:26.099]  We need to start focusing locally, taking control.
[01:42:26.359 --> 01:42:27.480]  I tell you to be a leader.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.501]  I tell you to get involved.
[01:42:28.821 --> 01:42:32.824]  You are not going to hear that from operatives.
[01:42:34.705 --> 01:42:39.829]  We never spend our time attacking other so-called patriots, even people we know are feds.
[01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:42.891]  Because that will just turn into a big diversion.
[01:42:42.931 --> 01:42:44.513]  It will actually give them more attention.
[01:42:46.474 --> 01:42:47.415]  You know, the whole...
[01:42:48.630 --> 01:42:53.855]  People we weren't sure of, now we are sure of, all the ridiculous stuff they're putting out on 9-11.
[01:42:53.995 --> 01:42:55.336]  I have to weigh all of that.
[01:42:56.638 --> 01:43:05.386]  The number one thing you can see in a COINTELPRO operative is all they'll do is tell you they're the only leader, don't trust any of these other groups, everything's infiltrated, everything's watched.
[01:43:05.726 --> 01:43:07.508]  I'll tell you everything isn't infiltrated.
[01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:09.390]  They don't have as much power.
[01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:12.593]  They tell you they're spying on everybody to intimidate you.
[01:43:13.422 --> 01:43:14.423]  They can spy.
[01:43:14.443 --> 01:43:15.203]  They are spying.
[01:43:15.243 --> 01:43:18.586]  But it's all in basic breakdowns and algorithms.
[01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:21.628]  They can't go look up billions of people and what they're doing.
[01:43:21.648 --> 01:43:23.229]  It's all an intimidation.
[01:43:23.949 --> 01:43:25.630]  I'm telling you we're going to win this thing.
[01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:27.291]  I'm telling you we can win.
[01:43:27.532 --> 01:43:29.213]  I'm telling you we can get the republic back.
[01:43:29.473 --> 01:43:31.274]  I'm telling you we don't want to get violent.
[01:43:32.255 --> 01:43:33.636]  And then Alex is a fed.
[01:43:33.956 --> 01:43:35.837]  He never says we ought to get violent.
[01:43:36.317 --> 01:43:38.679]  And then these websites talk about all the people they want to kill.
[01:43:39.239 --> 01:43:41.361]  If they weren't feds, they'd be arrested in hours.
[01:43:44.901 --> 01:43:47.983]  Another thing, feds don't operate for 12 years.
[01:43:48.063 --> 01:43:52.366]  They don't, in almost every case, they don't.
[01:43:52.386 --> 01:43:53.386]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[01:43:53.907 --> 01:43:55.628]  The North American Union is here.
[01:43:55.748 --> 01:43:56.548]  Are you going to fight it?
[01:43:56.908 --> 01:43:58.630]  Are you going to stay on issue and message?
[01:43:59.490 --> 01:44:01.772]  Look, just do yourself something that's easy and a favor, okay?
[01:44:02.032 --> 01:44:04.113]  It isn't true, but just decide I'm bad.
[01:44:05.374 --> 01:44:05.634]  Okay?
[01:44:06.357 --> 01:44:11.541]  Just decide on bad, if that'll get you to move on to some real issues.
[01:44:11.581 --> 01:44:15.345]  See, because most of these websites and organizations and groups, they ninny.
[01:44:18.347 --> 01:44:22.150]  They don't get out and fight the New World Order.
[01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:23.652]  They don't go start organizations.
[01:44:23.692 --> 01:44:25.653]  They don't find ways to reach out to more people.
[01:44:25.974 --> 01:44:29.817]  They'll ninny about how I'm not doing the show right.
[01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:34.815]  They'll nanny and perseverate on how I should do a better job.
[01:44:35.155 --> 01:44:42.404]  Hey, I have never claimed to be perfect, and I've never sat here and said that I've got all the answers.
[01:44:44.125 --> 01:44:48.711]  I looked at the McVeigh photos, stills.
[01:44:49.812 --> 01:44:51.594]  I looked at the McVeigh...
[01:44:53.638 --> 01:45:12.524]  You know, one big thing is if you take the video of McVeigh and you take the color out because he's so tanned, and then when you've seen he's all pale from jail, you take the picture, because we did this just because Kevin made a copy of the news article and gave it to me, and I'm like, that looks even more like him.
[01:45:12.544 --> 01:45:13.244]  That is him.
[01:45:14.105 --> 01:45:16.245]  Try taking the colored photos we've got.
[01:45:16.305 --> 01:45:17.926]  Try making a Xerox copy of them.
[01:45:18.974 --> 01:45:22.656]  Off a color printout, or do a black and white print, and then you really see it.
[01:45:23.156 --> 01:45:26.258]  What a lot of people see is that the top of the head's covered.
[01:45:26.758 --> 01:45:28.819]  They see that the skin is super tanned.
[01:45:28.839 --> 01:45:30.840]  I mean, he's got very dark skin.
[01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:34.842]  He's got a very deep tan.
[01:45:41.905 --> 01:45:42.786]  You look at that.
[01:45:43.746 --> 01:45:44.627]  You look at the nose.
[01:45:44.647 --> 01:45:45.367]  You look at the teeth.
[01:45:45.387 --> 01:45:46.267]  You look at the eyes.
[01:45:46.307 --> 01:45:47.348]  You look at everything.
[01:45:48.371 --> 01:45:50.193]  And it is a spitting image of McVeigh.
[01:45:50.233 --> 01:46:09.008]  And then a major university professor did the voice test and said that it is a, quote, high match and that a very unusual voice, again, very unusual voice that has some type of speech impediment.
[01:46:11.090 --> 01:46:11.250]  Now,
[01:46:12.563 --> 01:46:14.565]  It won't be the first time and it won't be the last.
[01:46:14.685 --> 01:46:16.206]  I don't think it's a baloney story.
[01:46:16.766 --> 01:46:20.549]  But it won't be the first time and it won't be the last, if it is, that I've been taken.
[01:46:22.290 --> 01:46:24.932]  We get up here and we admit to that.
[01:46:25.333 --> 01:46:28.055]  In fact, let me just give you some ammunition against me while we do this.
[01:46:28.155 --> 01:46:28.655]  Don't worry.
[01:46:28.875 --> 01:46:30.596]  Folks, the New World Order, somebody will probably kill me.
[01:46:30.877 --> 01:46:31.977]  I'll probably go to prison.
[01:46:33.278 --> 01:46:36.481]  And you can dance around and say I'm bad when that happens.
[01:46:36.741 --> 01:46:37.261]  It'll feel good.
[01:46:38.002 --> 01:46:41.965]  Because you can't pull down the New World Order, you think, so just go ahead and go after Alex Jones.
[01:46:46.192 --> 01:46:47.312]  Here, let me give you some ammunition.
[01:46:49.993 --> 01:46:50.714]  Sam Danner.
[01:46:51.574 --> 01:46:52.394]  Oh, remember that guy?
[01:46:52.434 --> 01:46:54.375]  And I should have known the sources that was coming from.
[01:46:54.735 --> 01:46:56.696]  Some of the biggest operatives out there on the globe.
[01:46:58.976 --> 01:46:59.837]  Total baloney.
[01:47:00.917 --> 01:47:03.018]  But the guy sounded so uncredible.
[01:47:03.038 --> 01:47:09.000]  I mean, the greatest minds out there in cloak and dagger on the enemy side get fooled.
[01:47:09.020 --> 01:47:10.340]  I mean, this stuff is hard.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:12.701]  You try doing this three hours a day on air.
[01:47:13.416 --> 01:47:14.716]  Three hours of preparation.
[01:47:15.116 --> 01:47:19.057]  You try then trying to make films, do TV shows, do radio interviews this morning.
[01:47:19.297 --> 01:47:20.658]  I'll be on Lars Larson tonight.
[01:47:21.218 --> 01:47:22.918]  I'll have to fight to see my family.
[01:47:24.579 --> 01:47:35.161]  I love all the armchair quarterbacks that have whole websites dedicated to attacking me and others, and who never put out any original material, or if they do, it's all disinfo.
[01:47:35.181 --> 01:47:38.642]  Let me think of what else we've made mistakes on.
[01:47:40.086 --> 01:47:41.727]  There's not a lot of examples.
[01:47:42.208 --> 01:47:44.369]  Hey, the phones, we don't screen your calls.
[01:47:44.449 --> 01:47:45.970]  Call in with examples of where I've been wrong.
[01:47:46.991 --> 01:47:48.492]  Let's do something destructive today.
[01:47:48.512 --> 01:47:51.695]  I mean, let's, you know, you want to talk about going to El Pro?
[01:47:51.895 --> 01:47:52.795]  You want to hurt the movement?
[01:47:52.815 --> 01:47:54.136]  Here, let's do it right now here together.
[01:47:55.878 --> 01:47:57.579]  Okay, let's not keep our eyes on the game.
[01:47:57.899 --> 01:48:07.046]  Hey, man, I've been telling you all along that I probably won't be here forever, that I can't do it all for you, that I don't have all the answers.
[01:48:08.351 --> 01:48:11.534]  You know, my poo-poo, folks, doesn't smell like roses.
[01:48:12.114 --> 01:48:13.715]  I'm not perfect, okay?
[01:48:14.036 --> 01:48:18.840]  So you start a radio show, and you start a website.
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:27.687]  And most of you that do, you get attacked that first time, you go crazy and do a tizzy, and you spend all your time attacking other people back until you burn out and never do any work.
[01:48:27.707 --> 01:48:32.571]  Why don't you go out with video cameras on the weekend and show cops abusing people and put it on YouTube?
[01:48:33.948 --> 01:48:34.868]  Why don't you expose that?
[01:48:34.928 --> 01:48:37.269]  Why don't you go expose the illegal aliens coming across our border?
[01:48:37.289 --> 01:48:38.470]  Why don't you go join the Minutemen?
[01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:45.813]  Why don't you go start looking at your city budget and expose the comprehensive annual financial reports?
[01:48:47.774 --> 01:48:54.757]  Why don't you do the hundreds of important, fight the phony environmental groups stealing people's property all over the country?
[01:48:55.237 --> 01:49:00.699]  Why don't you go show how the land they grabbed in Austin, Texas has been given over to developers when they claimed it was going to be for a city park?
[01:49:02.566 --> 01:49:04.187]  Why don't you pick the thousands of issues?
[01:49:04.207 --> 01:49:06.007]  Why don't you get your town defluoridated?
[01:49:06.627 --> 01:49:07.988]  Why don't you try to get the vaccines?
[01:49:08.028 --> 01:49:11.509]  Why don't you go help these families having their kids snatched by CPS?
[01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:22.233]  Why don't you instead of sitting up there in the peanut gallery constantly analyzing and griping and complaining why don't you get up and do something?
[01:49:22.433 --> 01:49:26.234]  And I'm talking to people too who supposedly are getting up and doing something.
[01:49:26.514 --> 01:49:27.575]  Why don't you do more?
[01:49:30.976 --> 01:49:31.236]  Okay?
[01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:33.930]  I think this story looks credible.
[01:49:34.650 --> 01:49:37.432]  It's been researched by some reporters that have done good work in the past.
[01:49:37.472 --> 01:49:38.093]  I looked at that.
[01:49:40.514 --> 01:49:44.197]  And we did the interview.
[01:49:44.217 --> 01:49:46.338]  Okay?
[01:49:47.379 --> 01:49:52.102]  Now, if you don't like it, don't let the door hit you in the butt.
[01:49:52.162 --> 01:49:53.563]  Don't ever listen to this show again.
[01:49:56.844 --> 01:50:00.007]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.347 --> 01:50:02.289]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:10.335]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.015 --> 01:50:18.061]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.461 --> 01:50:21.384]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.744 --> 01:50:24.106]  The White House probed them to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.526 --> 01:50:25.367]  NSA spies.
[01:50:26.762 --> 01:50:29.903]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:50:30.183 --> 01:50:33.664]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.144 --> 01:50:36.045]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.405 --> 01:50:40.346]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:55.401]  Good morning, honey.
[01:50:55.741 --> 01:51:01.727]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[01:51:02.027 --> 01:51:02.627]  Yeah.
[01:51:03.028 --> 01:51:04.449]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:51:04.809 --> 01:51:08.212]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[01:51:08.673 --> 01:51:10.174]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:51:10.614 --> 01:51:12.336]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:51:12.716 --> 01:51:14.478]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:51:14.678 --> 01:51:15.539]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:51:15.939 --> 01:51:18.202]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:51:18.462 --> 01:51:18.782]  What?
[01:51:19.223 --> 01:51:29.694]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:51:29.995 --> 01:51:34.820]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.342]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[01:52:01.689 --> 01:52:04.871]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:52:36.127 --> 01:52:37.828]  David, Johnny, John, Chris, other calls are coming up.
[01:53:05.743 --> 01:53:15.471]  I've been so busy fighting the New World Order, always making a new film, I didn't ever have time to remaster, redo my first seven films and put them on DVD.
[01:53:16.732 --> 01:53:18.174]  They are now on DVD.
[01:53:19.695 --> 01:53:20.356]  They are done.
[01:53:20.396 --> 01:53:21.096]  They are completed.
[01:53:21.657 --> 01:53:25.800]  They are available right now, my first seven films.
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:31.165]  America Destroyed by Design, all three of my Police State films, The Masters of Terror.
[01:53:32.003 --> 01:53:35.944]  Comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[01:53:38.245 --> 01:53:44.027]  They are all available right now for you at InfoWars.com.

[01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:53.250]  That would normally be $60.
[01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:58.850]  Please, the effect is massive.
[01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:27.771]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:54:27.871 --> 01:54:29.591]  David in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:54:29.611 --> 01:54:30.031]  Go ahead.
[01:54:32.892 --> 01:54:33.512]  Is David there?
[01:54:37.573 --> 01:54:38.273]  You there now, David?
[01:54:38.513 --> 01:54:38.973]  Yes, sir, I am.
[01:54:38.993 --> 01:54:39.673]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:54:42.494 --> 01:54:43.654]  All right, he doesn't know he's there.
[01:54:43.794 --> 01:54:44.354]  It's all right.
[01:54:44.814 --> 01:54:46.375]  Let's go to Johnny in Hawaii.
[01:54:46.435 --> 01:54:47.115]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:54:51.388 --> 01:54:52.449]  When it rains, it pours.
[01:54:52.529 --> 01:54:53.609]  Okay, thank you, Johnny.
[01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:55.770]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:54:55.810 --> 01:54:56.270]  Go ahead.
[01:54:56.290 --> 01:54:58.271]  Yes, Alex.
[01:54:58.771 --> 01:55:06.715]  I don't think you're an agent, but I agree with everything you've said about the inside job of 9-11, the police state measures.
[01:55:07.435 --> 01:55:09.396]  I think you do a masterful job.
[01:55:09.436 --> 01:55:10.697]  You're a treasurer on those issues.
[01:55:11.337 --> 01:55:11.997]  I'm on the left.
[01:55:12.077 --> 01:55:17.840]  I voted for Workers' Org right in because I agree with you about the Democrats and Republicans both being a party of war.
[01:55:19.848 --> 01:55:23.470]  And I've even advocated on three national radio programs.
[01:55:23.490 --> 01:55:24.411]  Your Terrorist Storm.
[01:55:25.491 --> 01:55:27.712]  Everybody get that on Google.
[01:55:28.353 --> 01:55:30.394]  But I have serious disagreements.
[01:55:30.454 --> 01:55:45.901]  I would ask some people to check out a website called watch.pair.com forward slash JBS watch.pair.com forward slash JBS and it's got a well documented bibliography of
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:56:15.442]  ...of how the John Birch Society is intimately tied in with the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, through its Western Goals spy organization that evaded a lot of the prohibitions against spying to funnel a lot of the spying operations for the National Security Agency, the FBI, CIA, and its connections to Reinhard Galen, the Nazi spymaster who was brought into the CIA and Western...
[01:56:16.468 --> 01:56:18.489]  Intelligence after the Second World War.
[01:56:18.869 --> 01:56:25.473]  Western Golds under Larry McDonald actually set up the western branch of that and collaborated with this Nazi.
[01:56:26.094 --> 01:56:39.061]  Other ultra-right fascist groups like the World Anti-Communist League and others who specialize in the kind of assassination death squads that Oliver North was involved in are also interlocked with that.
[01:56:39.121 --> 01:56:40.642]  And many people like H.L.
[01:56:40.722 --> 01:56:42.263]  Hunt, this ultra-rightist who was
[01:56:42.717 --> 01:56:45.579]  Many researchers say it was implicated in the Kennedy assassination.
[01:56:45.659 --> 01:56:48.480]  It was a major funder of the John Birch Society.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:57:02.008]  But this article, which is put out by a Christian in the last part of it, I don't agree with it because in some ways it actually picks up some of the John Birch Society ideas, but it documents all of these fascist connections of the John Birch Society.
[01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:12.118]  And I think that in some ways you've been influenced by some of this, and on those issues I think you're going to be brought right back into the neocon camp.
[01:57:12.458 --> 01:57:15.119]  All right, what's the website again, John?
[01:57:15.639 --> 01:57:21.321]  It's watch.pair.com forward slash JBS.
[01:57:22.322 --> 01:57:28.064]  And I think it would open a lot of eyes about the John Birch Society's connections even to the CFR.
[01:57:28.984 --> 01:57:31.705]  Okay, John, I appreciate your call.
[01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:33.990]  Blackbird.
[01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:34.491]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:52.492]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:57:52.512 --> 01:57:55.074]  We are now into the third and final hour.
[01:58:21.036 --> 01:58:22.637]  I want to get more into the North American Union.
[01:58:22.677 --> 01:58:30.681]  One of the top CFR members that wrote up the current plan being implemented said, hey, in one more terror attack, we're going to be fully in the North American Union.
[01:58:32.302 --> 01:58:42.867]  That's what it's all going to be about, a North American police state capturing us as slaves to carry out their global war against any sovereign nation or people.
[01:58:43.387 --> 01:58:46.609]  I will get into that in some other reports here about the warmongering Democrats.
[01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:50.511]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:58:52.173 --> 01:58:56.556]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Florida, then Dave, Maggie, and others.
[01:58:56.616 --> 01:58:57.237]  Welcome, Chris.
[01:58:58.197 --> 01:58:59.298]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:58:59.318 --> 01:59:04.242]  I first have to disagree with you, even though that's not the reason I called.
[01:59:04.442 --> 01:59:08.145]  Don't go off and curse Child Protective Services or anybody.
[01:59:08.245 --> 01:59:18.452]  I mean, they're hateful enough, and all you do when you just return that hate is you complete their circuit, just short-circuit their anger and
[01:59:19.128 --> 01:59:20.429]  Follow Jesus' advice.
[01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:21.670]  Love and bless your enemies.
[01:59:21.690 --> 01:59:22.491]  Well, you're probably right.
[01:59:22.511 --> 01:59:24.432]  I just said I wish God would do something to them.
[01:59:24.813 --> 01:59:27.855]  I was crying out to God about these pieces of filth.
[01:59:28.956 --> 01:59:29.536]  Right, right.
[01:59:29.556 --> 01:59:30.917]  They terrorize people.
[01:59:30.937 --> 01:59:32.218]  They cause incredible pain.
[01:59:32.278 --> 01:59:33.199]  I'm tired of them.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:34.560]  Right.
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:35.721]  Just give it to God.
[01:59:35.801 --> 01:59:36.221]  That's right.
[01:59:37.182 --> 01:59:45.989]  And I want to give some legal information I normally wouldn't do unless I felt like somebody like you would want to follow up on it, possibly, or someone wants to fight you.
[01:59:46.942 --> 01:59:51.103]  Say a ticket, a code violation, anything that you'd have to pay with cash.
[01:59:51.824 --> 01:59:53.344]  I understand you got another ticket.
[01:59:54.204 --> 01:59:55.445]  And this is what I used.
[01:59:55.745 --> 01:59:57.005]  I mentioned it once before.
[01:59:57.025 --> 01:59:58.786]  No, you tell them, show me the law.
[02:00:00.946 --> 02:00:03.287]  Well, what I do is I offer them lawful money.
[02:00:03.487 --> 02:00:05.208]  And I use only two different laws.
[02:00:05.308 --> 02:00:07.648]  I use Title 12 of the U.S.
[02:00:07.708 --> 02:00:12.750]  Code, Section 152, that defines lawful money as gold and silver coins of the United States.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:29.811]  And I also use the Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3-603, which when they refuse the lawful money, which is a gold or silver coin of the United States... That does work sometimes, but now they're so criminal, they will still just disregard it.
[02:00:29.851 --> 02:00:40.898]  But a lot of people try to pay their debts now with pennies, or they make banks take their payments in pennies, and it devastates them, and it makes them really mad, but it's a great thing to do.
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:43.741]  Oh, I never thought about that.
[02:00:43.841 --> 02:00:46.123]  But, yeah, I've tried it.
[02:00:46.623 --> 02:00:48.765]  The state attorney had no argument against me.
[02:00:49.165 --> 02:00:54.148]  They simply said the Uniform Commercial Code doesn't apply, and I asked how, but they had no response.
[02:00:54.368 --> 02:01:01.453]  Yeah, they don't have a law, so then you try to pay their non-law under a law, and then they say the law doesn't count.
[02:01:01.533 --> 02:01:03.195]  I know it's lawlessness, folks.
[02:01:03.535 --> 02:01:09.399]  They try to act under the de facto government instead of the de jure government.
[02:01:09.479 --> 02:01:10.279]  It's by fiat.
[02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:11.100]  Right.
[02:01:11.781 --> 02:01:18.492]  And for calling into talk shows, I call into talk shows, and you can call them these talk show host cowards.
[02:01:18.532 --> 02:01:19.353]  Don't be afraid of it.
[02:01:20.315 --> 02:01:23.680]  Tell the audience that you can't trust a coward because they'll always sell you out.
[02:01:24.156 --> 02:01:29.479]  And the talk show host will normally be quiet because he thinks that you're about to hang up, but you can just keep going on usually.
[02:01:29.499 --> 02:01:38.644]  You tell the talk show host that if they were really anti-war, the ones that pretend to be, they would talk about certain issues.
[02:01:38.684 --> 02:01:40.325]  The depleted uranium is a great one.
[02:01:40.345 --> 02:01:44.207]  You know, the anthrax, how the treats are being, the anthrax vaccines or other vaccines.
[02:01:44.227 --> 02:01:50.591]  If you really support the troops, you talk about how they have to pay for themselves to be flown back when their legs are blown off.
[02:01:51.741 --> 02:01:53.662]  Yes, there's so many different issues.
[02:01:53.722 --> 02:02:02.125]  The North American Union, if you're anti-globalism, you talk about the North American Union instead of pretending like no such thing is happening.
[02:02:03.046 --> 02:02:07.908]  Yeah, that's what these national hosts are still, it's the mainline neocons won't even talk about it.
[02:02:09.408 --> 02:02:12.350]  Well, I'm surprised even Glenn Beck did.
[02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:13.010]  That amazed me.
[02:02:13.170 --> 02:02:15.491]  That guy is a real piece of work.
[02:02:16.144 --> 02:02:18.324]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:18.464 --> 02:02:23.945]  I just can't imagine that he's not for the other guys, but I just can't.
[02:02:23.985 --> 02:02:26.406]  So thank you enough in the Watson Brothers for all your articles.
[02:02:26.426 --> 02:02:27.906]  I use those a lot for notes.
[02:02:27.986 --> 02:02:32.707]  I make a brief outline before I call on talk shows and record them to confront them.
[02:02:32.807 --> 02:02:36.108]  If they cut you off, hold them to their words when you call them back later.
[02:02:36.868 --> 02:02:37.788]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:37.828 --> 02:02:38.808]  I really appreciate it.
[02:02:39.548 --> 02:02:41.049]  Lots of calls, tons of news.
[02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.869]  Straight ahead.
[02:02:41.929 --> 02:02:42.389]  Stay with us.
[02:02:49.002 --> 02:02:52.164]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.524 --> 02:02:54.466]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.826 --> 02:03:02.491]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.171 --> 02:03:10.215]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:13.578]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.938 --> 02:03:16.279]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.699 --> 02:03:17.500]  NSA spies.
[02:03:18.710 --> 02:03:22.052]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:22.332 --> 02:03:25.894]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.294 --> 02:03:28.215]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.575 --> 02:03:32.497]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:53.907]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:03:54.147 --> 02:03:58.510]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:03:58.811 --> 02:04:07.718]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:04:07.918 --> 02:04:11.541]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:04:11.821 --> 02:04:12.483]  We're good to go.
[02:04:12.503 --> 02:04:12.964]  We're good to go.
[02:04:24.375 --> 02:04:25.016]  What about you?
[02:04:25.656 --> 02:04:31.021]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:04:31.081 --> 02:04:32.162]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:04:32.242 --> 02:04:34.143]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:52.441]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:04:52.881 --> 02:04:57.622]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:04:58.002 --> 02:05:00.643]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:05:01.123 --> 02:05:04.544]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:05:05.304 --> 02:05:09.625]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:05:10.065 --> 02:05:13.265]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:05:13.845 --> 02:05:16.706]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:05:17.463 --> 02:05:19.624]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:05:19.664 --> 02:05:21.746]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:05:21.766 --> 02:05:22.126]  U.S.
[02:05:22.186 --> 02:05:23.847]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:05:23.867 --> 02:05:24.227]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:24.587 --> 02:05:25.048]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:05:25.068 --> 02:05:25.608]  Ask for George.
[02:05:50.325 --> 02:05:50.966]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.626 --> 02:05:52.687]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.387 --> 02:05:54.528]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.169 --> 02:05:55.989]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:57.610]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.291 --> 02:06:02.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.474 --> 02:06:06.557]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.987 --> 02:06:08.967]  Spinning the wheel here.
[02:06:09.007 --> 02:06:14.849]  Never know what interesting direction our callers will take us.
[02:06:14.869 --> 02:06:15.149]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:16.609]  And I will run through more of the news.
[02:06:17.129 --> 02:06:22.590]  We've got about 51 minutes left in this transmission against tyranny.
[02:06:22.610 --> 02:06:22.930]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:27.031]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Canada, then Maggie, Kevin, Dylan, and others.
[02:06:27.071 --> 02:06:27.651]  Welcome, David.
[02:06:28.332 --> 02:06:29.032]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:29.052 --> 02:06:29.972]  How are you doing today?
[02:06:30.012 --> 02:06:30.352]  Pretty good.
[02:06:31.810 --> 02:06:41.734]  I'm a first-time caller to your show, but I want to tell you I greatly admire your courage, honesty, and integrity, which are unfortunately rare commodities with people today.
[02:06:41.914 --> 02:06:46.336]  Up here in Canada, I've been following the North American Union with particular interest, and I'll tell you,
[02:06:47.048 --> 02:06:49.750]  The media up here does not cover it at all.
[02:06:50.010 --> 02:06:55.674]  Well, as bad as you say your media is, I'd say there's been ten times the coverage in the Canadian press.
[02:06:56.275 --> 02:07:03.420]  I've probably seen 80, 90, and I probably miss most of them, articles in your papers saying the end of Canada.
[02:07:04.601 --> 02:07:08.304]  Well, it's interesting you say that, because I know when they had the meetings up in Banff,
[02:07:09.137 --> 02:07:16.280]  With all the bigwigs, including our Minister of Homeland Security, Stockwell Day, and all the... And including most of the members of the media.
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:18.861]  I mean, that is the big editors who keep it quiet, yeah.
[02:07:19.361 --> 02:07:24.883]  Yeah, and it was funny, because the Craig and Canyon, which is just like a local Banff newspaper, was the one who broke it.
[02:07:24.923 --> 02:07:26.824]  They covered it for one day, and that was it.
[02:07:26.864 --> 02:07:28.845]  There was nothing in the Globe and Mail, nothing in
[02:07:28.985 --> 02:07:31.186]  Yeah, for those who forgot about that a few months ago, tell them.
[02:07:31.446 --> 02:07:41.850]  You have the North American Union with the leaders of the three countries of their state departments meeting and hundreds of top CEOs telling them how to set it up because, again, it's all a big orgy of thieving.
[02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:45.391]  They set up a new government, design it for taxation grids.
[02:07:45.651 --> 02:07:46.391]  Tell folks about it.
[02:07:47.252 --> 02:07:55.875]  Well, it was incredible, too, because our former premier, Peter Lockheed, who I used to have a tremendous amount of respect for, was one of the co-chairs
[02:07:56.556 --> 02:08:00.419]  Along with George Schultz and somebody else from Mexico.
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:09.146]  Again, what really struck me was, again, that the story was sort of touched on briefly for one day and then it was just buried.
[02:08:09.366 --> 02:08:14.110]  And I actually confronted the CBC Bureau Chief for Ottawa on the radio about it.
[02:08:15.011 --> 02:08:18.634]  And he hemmed and hawed about how it was a secret agreement.
[02:08:18.674 --> 02:08:19.875]  We really don't know much about it.
[02:08:19.915 --> 02:08:22.136]  You're right, we should be really looking into it a little bit more.
[02:08:22.196 --> 02:08:23.978]  Oh boy, you ought to send me that audio clip.
[02:08:24.554 --> 02:08:27.955]  Yeah, well, I don't have a copy of it.
[02:08:28.115 --> 02:08:39.057]  But I guess, and so, again, I want to thank you because you've really opened my eyes to a lot of the way the media basically shapes our opinions as opposed to informs us.
[02:08:39.437 --> 02:08:53.640]  And I guess the only thing I can throw out, which I would not only throw out to you, but I would throw out to your listeners as well, is it's kind of a physics premise called Boyle's Law, which is that
[02:08:54.264 --> 02:09:02.707]  Water under 100 degrees doesn't really do much, but once it reaches that kind of critical mass, it becomes an unstoppable force.
[02:09:03.427 --> 02:09:16.012]  And I think all of us, I have your videos, I'm definitely talking it up with people, and a lot of the time when I talk to people about many of these issues and try to inform them about 9-11, about North American Union, about the way we're moving toward
[02:09:16.696 --> 02:09:20.479]  A police state, they don't really, it doesn't register at all.
[02:09:21.259 --> 02:09:36.289]  I'm quite amazed sometimes that people who I consider very intelligent, very, very educated, you know, strong engineering and scientific backgrounds, you confront them with things that, and that was one of the things that woke me up, was the speed of the collapse of the World Trade Centers.
[02:09:36.389 --> 02:09:37.650]  It didn't make sense at all.
[02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:40.312]  And when I sort of read a little bit about the physics behind it,
[02:09:40.888 --> 02:09:46.592]  That totally shifted my opinion to everything and it was subsequent to that that I kind of stumbled across your site.
[02:09:47.412 --> 02:09:53.937]  But I think we just need to keep talking to people and keep planting the seeds and keep chatting with them about it.
[02:09:54.017 --> 02:09:58.520]  Not necessarily in a confrontational way because you don't necessarily want to close that door forever.
[02:09:59.144 --> 02:10:03.146]  But you want to keep just going back to them and telling them... No, no, I agree.
[02:10:03.166 --> 02:10:13.092]  We need to spend our time reaching out to others instead of nitpicking who our leader is in the fight against the New World Order and who's the best and who... You know, you be the leaders, folks.
[02:10:13.192 --> 02:10:13.793]  Get out there.
[02:10:13.833 --> 02:10:14.533]  Take action.
[02:10:15.234 --> 02:10:15.814]  Absolutely.
[02:10:16.094 --> 02:10:16.634]  Absolutely.
[02:10:16.674 --> 02:10:19.176]  And I think the day will come.
[02:10:19.316 --> 02:10:26.120]  One of the things I notice about the media today when I compare it to, like, 30, 40 years ago, you know, 60s, that kind of time frame...
[02:10:26.744 --> 02:10:32.365]  There was a lot more ability for music and some of the popular culture mediums to kind of boil to the surface.
[02:10:32.425 --> 02:10:34.046]  I'm thinking Bob Dylan and some of those guys.
[02:10:34.066 --> 02:10:37.426]  Yeah, that's why they punished the Dixie Chicks was to set a precedent.
[02:10:37.826 --> 02:10:43.108]  Hey, that's why they fired that hockey player for not worshipping and signing the flag for the troops.
[02:10:43.128 --> 02:10:45.708]  Because they're saying, you're going to support the war or you're fired.
[02:10:46.048 --> 02:10:47.468]  You're going to go along with this.
[02:10:47.508 --> 02:10:48.369]  This is how it is.
[02:10:48.869 --> 02:10:54.530]  Yeah, and I'm hoping that artists out there, I play a lot of music myself and
[02:10:55.091 --> 02:11:07.498]  One of the things that I'm trying to do is get up there and sing about these issues because, again, people will be more receptive to hearing things sometimes in a different medium than they will in a verbal discussion, right?
[02:11:07.558 --> 02:11:17.123]  And I know that you mentioned at one point there were a number of artists who've sent you music that talk about different aspects of... I mean, it's all over the web.
[02:11:17.163 --> 02:11:17.943]  Listen, I've got to jump.
[02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:19.184]  I appreciate your great call.
[02:11:20.725 --> 02:11:24.567]  But, look, we keep saying people aren't waking up.
[02:11:25.262 --> 02:11:31.004]  But then, you look at the statistics, 80 plus percent don't have a good view of the Congress.
[02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:36.006]  70 plus percent are against the war, including 70 percent of the tribes.
[02:11:37.647 --> 02:11:41.549]  90 plus percent are against all these trans-Texas corridors and land grabs.
[02:11:42.649 --> 02:11:44.490]  99 percent are against the Supreme Court ruling.
[02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:49.252]  90 plus percent are against the North American Union in polls.
[02:11:50.012 --> 02:11:51.953]  I do radio interviews every single day.
[02:11:52.794 --> 02:11:55.335]  And it's a rarity now to have people call in and disagree with me.
[02:11:55.355 --> 02:12:02.518]  I mean, last time I was on the big, you know, neocon Lars Larson show on hundreds of stations.
[02:12:03.278 --> 02:12:05.259]  I'm back on it today, so I use that as an example.
[02:12:05.279 --> 02:12:07.060]  I'll be back on tonight, scheduled.
[02:12:09.341 --> 02:12:15.363]  And he took, I don't know, eight, nine calls, and I think, you know, one of the people disagreed with me.
[02:12:18.512 --> 02:12:21.313]  I mean, that's because the folks are off the reservation.
[02:12:21.333 --> 02:12:23.394]  They're not buying into this phony conservative bilge.
[02:12:23.774 --> 02:12:25.434]  They're not buying into the phony liberal bilge.
[02:12:25.454 --> 02:12:31.516]  They know it's just two flavors of the same Kool-Aid that's filled with cyanide, basically, psychologically and intellectually.
[02:12:33.717 --> 02:12:35.338]  And so, again, I'll say it.
[02:12:35.718 --> 02:12:41.160]  I am not here to lead everyone or to have all the answers or to know all the answers.
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:43.400]  I've got a pretty good handle on what's going on.
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:44.261]  We've had an effect.
[02:12:44.321 --> 02:12:45.041]  I know we can win.
[02:12:45.777 --> 02:12:46.897]  I know we can take action.
[02:12:47.498 --> 02:12:50.519]  And I just want you all to get involved.
[02:12:51.319 --> 02:12:53.860]  And a lot of other folks say, get involved behind me.
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:55.421]  No, do not get involved behind me.
[02:12:56.621 --> 02:12:58.302]  And watch who else you get involved with.
[02:12:58.722 --> 02:13:02.103]  It's better to just have lots of you out there taking action and getting involved.
[02:13:02.123 --> 02:13:03.323]  It's an idea.
[02:13:03.383 --> 02:13:04.284]  It's a way of life.
[02:13:04.384 --> 02:13:05.444]  That's unstoppable.
[02:13:07.045 --> 02:13:10.906]  Ideas, as V says, are bulletproof.
[02:13:12.787 --> 02:13:13.367]  And it's true.
[02:13:14.352 --> 02:13:15.753]  They cannot stop an idea.
[02:13:17.074 --> 02:13:19.596]  And their strawman attacks and everything they do are failing.
[02:13:20.337 --> 02:13:22.979]  Let's go ahead and talk to Maggie in Texas.
[02:13:22.999 --> 02:13:23.659]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:25.080]  Hello, Alex.
[02:13:26.021 --> 02:13:41.653]  As you've probably noticed, the Austin newspapers and TV are currently full of stories about this family with five autistic children who are getting a home makeover from one of those reality shows.
[02:13:42.113 --> 02:13:43.054]  And the media...
[02:13:44.202 --> 02:13:48.584]  is giving a warm, fuzzy spin to this very tragic story.
[02:13:49.224 --> 02:13:51.685]  So I would like to say three things.
[02:13:51.765 --> 02:13:53.206]  First, what do you make of this?
[02:13:53.446 --> 02:13:57.468]  Five children out of six autistic in one family.
[02:13:57.608 --> 02:14:00.789]  Secondly, I already knew about this family.
[02:14:00.849 --> 02:14:10.833]  I had heard about them, and there was an extremely good article about a year ago in USA Today, which I have located, including a revealing photo gallery.
[02:14:10.873 --> 02:14:12.354]  Would you like me to send that to you?
[02:14:13.126 --> 02:14:13.827]  Yes, I would.
[02:14:14.207 --> 02:14:19.973]  And third, would you consider having perhaps one of these parents on your show after the excitement dies down?
[02:14:20.233 --> 02:14:20.834]  Yes.
[02:14:21.394 --> 02:14:22.616]  I heard an inkling of this.
[02:14:22.876 --> 02:14:25.298]  Frankly, I'm not too focused on local news.
[02:14:25.518 --> 02:14:26.099]  I know you're not.
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:27.480]  And I should be.
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:29.262]  I just can't stay focused on all of it.
[02:14:31.464 --> 02:14:36.489]  Why don't you give us a little bit of background on it, and then I'll comment on why autism is up...
[02:14:38.539 --> 02:14:44.643]  Well, over 10,000%, but let's go ahead right now and fill me and others in who aren't aware.
[02:14:44.923 --> 02:14:45.604]  Yes, okay.
[02:14:45.684 --> 02:14:50.487]  I have just refreshed my memory on this via the Internet myself.
[02:14:51.127 --> 02:15:03.976]  I first ran across something about this family probably a year or so ago, surfing the web, because I'm interested somewhat in autism myself, owing to there being an autistic child in the family.
[02:15:04.856 --> 02:15:06.277]  And what I found was there...
[02:15:07.731 --> 02:15:11.272]  They have six children.
[02:15:11.733 --> 02:15:12.673]  Their name is O'Donnell.
[02:15:13.553 --> 02:15:21.357]  And they have six children between the ages of maybe 14 and 2 or something like that.
[02:15:21.537 --> 02:15:24.738]  In other words, a very big age range.
[02:15:24.918 --> 02:15:29.860]  And all but one of them have been diagnosed with some form of autism.
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:31.061]  OK.
[02:15:31.101 --> 02:15:32.781]  So now they've made a TV show out of it.
[02:15:32.841 --> 02:15:33.422]  Isn't it cute?
[02:15:33.782 --> 02:15:33.982]  No.
[02:15:34.382 --> 02:15:36.643]  Well, what happened is it's not a well,
[02:15:37.099 --> 02:15:38.079]  That's peripheral.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:43.222]  It's not really peripheral, but they were chosen for this extreme makeover.
[02:15:43.282 --> 02:15:43.942]  Home makeover.
[02:15:44.042 --> 02:15:44.322]  Yeah.
[02:15:44.723 --> 02:15:50.225]  And so, of course, there's plenty of, isn't it cute, I'm sure, but the focus is on the house.
[02:15:50.345 --> 02:16:02.011]  However, I refreshed my memory on the Internet, and I found that about a year ago, I guess it was March of 2005,
[02:16:04.582 --> 02:16:18.831]  A writer, a USA Today writer named Sharon Jason, who actually was with the Statesman previously, had written a very much more detailed article describing the family, I would say with some depth and compassion.
[02:16:19.471 --> 02:16:24.694]  And there's even a photo gallery included in this story, which is online, and it shows the kids.
[02:16:24.794 --> 02:16:28.977]  And I recognize the postures of these kids because I've been around autism plenty.
[02:16:28.997 --> 02:16:32.879]  You know, the arched feet, the walking on tiptoe, this kind of thing.
[02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:34.000]  And...
[02:16:35.154 --> 02:16:36.636]  That is the story.
[02:16:36.696 --> 02:16:43.345]  They had, the first child was, she stopped talking at one and a half years.
[02:16:43.365 --> 02:16:46.009]  It's always 18 months.
[02:16:46.129 --> 02:16:48.151]  Yes, that's exactly what it says.
[02:16:48.973 --> 02:16:52.818]  And then they had, they were told it was not hereditary.
[02:16:53.584 --> 02:16:58.766]  And they went ahead and had three more children in a relatively short time.
[02:16:59.186 --> 02:17:01.846]  And let me guess, they went and got their vaccines like good parents.
[02:17:02.247 --> 02:17:05.247]  Well, now, it doesn't say that, and that would be something to dig up.
[02:17:05.487 --> 02:17:06.688]  But it's always 18 months.
[02:17:07.388 --> 02:17:08.708]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:17:08.728 --> 02:17:09.509]  Let me comment on this.
[02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:12.950]  I was going to say hereditary, not that I thought it was that, but that it could be.
[02:17:13.950 --> 02:17:15.690]  But it's still vaccine-related.
[02:17:15.730 --> 02:17:16.471]  This is what happens.
[02:17:17.271 --> 02:17:20.932]  Well, I'll give you the medical facts on the other side.
[02:17:22.051 --> 02:17:23.652]  And I appreciate your call, Maggie.
[02:17:25.533 --> 02:17:30.716]  Then we'll talk to Kevin Dillon and others, 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:17:30.836 --> 02:17:44.144]  I'm Alex Jones, the wartime broadcaster on the front lines, engaging the global crime syndicate at point-blank range in a last-ditch effort to save the republic and our families.
[02:17:45.934 --> 02:17:46.175]  I think?
[02:18:00.914 --> 02:18:02.474]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[02:18:02.534 --> 02:18:03.415]  Fiat currency.
[02:18:04.195 --> 02:18:08.136]  1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[02:18:08.456 --> 02:18:11.457]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[02:18:11.477 --> 02:18:14.358]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[02:18:14.378 --> 02:18:17.919]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[02:18:18.139 --> 02:18:20.919]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:26.441]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[02:18:26.581 --> 02:18:27.901]  Could government let this happen?
[02:18:28.041 --> 02:18:30.042]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[02:18:30.302 --> 02:18:37.512]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[02:18:37.552 --> 02:18:39.335]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[02:18:39.375 --> 02:18:40.677]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[02:18:40.717 --> 02:18:40.897]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:47.188 --> 02:18:48.169]  Good morning, honey.
[02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:54.516]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[02:18:54.796 --> 02:18:55.397]  Yeah.
[02:18:55.797 --> 02:18:57.218]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:18:57.579 --> 02:19:00.982]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel burkey system.
[02:19:01.443 --> 02:19:02.924]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:19:03.385 --> 02:19:05.086]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:19:05.487 --> 02:19:07.249]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:19:07.449 --> 02:19:08.310]  Honey, cheer up.
[02:19:08.710 --> 02:19:10.972]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:19:11.232 --> 02:19:11.552]  What?
[02:19:11.973 --> 02:19:22.461]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[02:19:22.761 --> 02:19:27.585]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:19:27.905 --> 02:19:29.106]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[02:19:29.186 --> 02:19:31.767]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209, or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.
[02:19:31.807 --> 02:19:32.027]  Call 888-803-4438.
[02:19:32.047 --> 02:19:32.227]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:19:33.308 --> 02:19:34.769]  Travel Berkey, not available in Iowa.
[02:19:45.911 --> 02:19:48.313]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.853 --> 02:19:58.560]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed a Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:03.203]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[02:20:03.743 --> 02:20:08.607]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[02:20:09.427 --> 02:20:18.732]  This is the same New World Order called for by former President George Herbert Walker Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War in 1990 and 1991.
[02:20:20.633 --> 02:20:28.337]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:29.037 --> 02:20:30.478]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:30.498 --> 02:20:30.858]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:30.878 --> 02:20:31.338]  Call now.
[02:20:31.638 --> 02:20:34.239]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:46.033 --> 02:20:47.634]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:20:47.955 --> 02:20:56.542]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:20:56.902 --> 02:21:02.627]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:21:02.867 --> 02:21:05.089]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?
[02:21:30.209 --> 02:21:30.930]  We're good to go.
[02:21:58.844 --> 02:21:59.524]  Welcome back.
[02:21:59.564 --> 02:22:05.045]  We'll be back to your calls here in a moment, but let me break this down.
[02:22:05.266 --> 02:22:08.946]  There is a gene that is missing or altered.
[02:22:26.548 --> 02:22:43.464]  In a small percentage of humans that allows more mercury that is digested to pass through the intestines.
[02:22:44.405 --> 02:22:45.927]  I forget if it's the large or the small.
[02:22:46.347 --> 02:22:47.348]  You can go look it all up.
[02:22:47.488 --> 02:22:48.309]  It's mainstream news.
[02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:51.632]  And so you normally build up mercury.
[02:22:52.797 --> 02:22:56.581]  And so from eating fish, eating foods, it's in the environment.
[02:22:57.121 --> 02:23:17.960]  And so you have a much higher statistical chance if you're missing that gene to naturally from what's in the environment for the mercury to make it through and to get into your bloodstream and to build up and cause brain damage, which is even more devastating when the brain is developing in the first four and a half to five years.
[02:23:19.745 --> 02:23:30.274]  And so statistically, the children that get vaccines who also don't have that gene get even higher levels because they're not just getting it from the food.
[02:23:31.074 --> 02:23:33.917]  Now they're also getting it from the vaccines.
[02:23:34.497 --> 02:23:38.440]  But that makes up a small percentage of all the autistic children.
[02:23:38.521 --> 02:23:42.964]  And the numbers are... I keep saying from 24 years ago.
[02:23:43.004 --> 02:23:44.165]  This number is about two years old.
[02:23:44.205 --> 02:23:45.146]  I need to pull up the new ones.
[02:23:45.186 --> 02:23:47.568]  I've seen reports saying it's far worse now, but...
[02:23:48.678 --> 02:23:51.579]  Statistics are always a few years behind, but new ones are coming out.
[02:23:51.599 --> 02:23:58.520]  24 years ago, 1 in 25,000 had autism.
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:23:59.361]  It was unknown.
[02:23:59.861 --> 02:24:00.861]  It was incredibly rare.
[02:24:01.361 --> 02:24:07.282]  Now, every major public school in this country has entire classrooms just for the autistic children.
[02:24:08.803 --> 02:24:09.763]  We've gone from one...
[02:24:13.119 --> 02:24:15.880]  24 years ago and 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 168.
[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:19.841]  That's the number that came out two years ago that were from two years before.
[02:24:19.901 --> 02:24:23.182]  So that would be 2002 numbers.
[02:24:25.263 --> 02:24:25.663]  Okay?
[02:24:25.943 --> 02:24:36.946]  And the press reports are saying the preliminary data they're crunching right now, this is the CDC and universities, is it's going to be 1 in 75 or 1 in 80-something.
[02:24:36.966 --> 02:24:38.047]  I'm going from memory here.
[02:24:38.647 --> 02:24:41.908]  So it's just unbelievable.
[02:24:43.493 --> 02:24:50.877]  By the way, it just came out that a lot of the psychotropic drugs, not just a schizophrenic drug for schizophrenia, are causing diabetes.
[02:24:51.138 --> 02:24:53.339]  As I said, it's a cocktail.
[02:24:53.359 --> 02:24:56.080]  As I was reading reports, the plenaries, now the finals are out.
[02:24:56.100 --> 02:24:57.221]  These are major universities.
[02:24:57.601 --> 02:25:05.346]  These are drug company studies as well that a lot of these psychotropics totally burn out different glands in the bodies.
[02:25:06.807 --> 02:25:09.849]  You throw a bunch of sugar on top of that and it pushes it over the edge.
[02:25:09.869 --> 02:25:10.449]  So that's why
[02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:16.473]  What is it, one in three now have some form of diabetes?
[02:25:16.513 --> 02:25:18.294]  I couldn't believe that number, and they're trending.
[02:25:18.674 --> 02:25:24.579]  USA, they reported what, earlier this year, that they're seeing half the population by the end of the decade?
[02:25:24.779 --> 02:25:27.461]  I mean, and this isn't over-reporting.
[02:25:27.701 --> 02:25:29.703]  This is people getting their legs sawed off, folks.
[02:25:31.444 --> 02:25:33.286]  I mean, I'm sure you've heard that, you've seen it on the news.
[02:25:33.646 --> 02:25:35.668]  I mean, it's just all getting insane.
[02:25:36.568 --> 02:25:40.291]  Everybody will just be dropping dead around as soon, and it'll just be, well, everything's fine.
[02:25:41.332 --> 02:25:42.433]  Just take more pills.
[02:25:44.688 --> 02:25:46.650]  Eat your rotten, irradiated beef.
[02:25:48.231 --> 02:25:49.532]  It's a whole bunch of things doing this.
[02:25:51.353 --> 02:26:00.300]  But, I mean, I go to the park to walk my dogs and with my family, and there might be ten families out there, and you almost always see an autistic child.
[02:26:01.742 --> 02:26:04.023]  You walk on the green belt, you see autistic children everywhere.
[02:26:04.043 --> 02:26:06.585]  You go to the mall, you see them everywhere.
[02:26:06.986 --> 02:26:08.327]  You go to church, you see them everywhere.
[02:26:10.155 --> 02:26:14.757]  And now it's going to be 1 in 75?
[02:26:15.057 --> 02:26:20.319]  And then they tell you, oh, there's no connection to mercury doing it, but we've taken the mercury out of the vaccines.
[02:26:21.139 --> 02:26:27.802]  Then the Associated Press reports, no, they went from 50 times safe levels to 250 times safe levels in most of the major vaccines.
[02:26:28.122 --> 02:26:37.285]  They just made small run lots available if your doctor happens to order them so you can get some vaccines without mercury.
[02:26:38.746 --> 02:26:39.206]  The Marisol.
[02:26:41.144 --> 02:26:41.464]  We're good to go.
[02:26:41.484 --> 02:26:42.064]  We're good to go.
[02:27:04.432 --> 02:27:06.353]  And a lot of times the child starts having a seizure.
[02:27:06.633 --> 02:27:07.873]  They take them back to the doctor.
[02:27:08.213 --> 02:27:13.615]  The doctor calls CPS if the child's grabbed because they claim they shook them.
[02:27:13.635 --> 02:27:14.955]  The government's sick, folks.
[02:27:15.535 --> 02:27:19.456]  They do this, and then they've got an added little caveat on top of it.
[02:27:19.957 --> 02:27:23.518]  In sudden death and infant syndrome, a lot of times it's the first round of shots.
[02:27:23.558 --> 02:27:24.818]  They die within hours of that.
[02:27:25.478 --> 02:27:27.739]  Little baby goes to sleep, don't ever wake up.
[02:27:28.659 --> 02:27:30.060]  So you go ahead and take your shots.
[02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:31.140]  Don't listen to this nut.
[02:27:32.037 --> 02:27:35.624]  You know, because I read all the surveys and the documents, and I'm evil.
[02:27:36.285 --> 02:27:37.206]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.687 --> 02:27:39.290]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.212 --> 02:27:42.896]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.463 --> 02:27:50.424]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:27:50.644 --> 02:27:54.226]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:27:54.466 --> 02:27:58.547]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:27:58.827 --> 02:27:59.767]  I was so amazed.
[02:28:00.007 --> 02:28:02.848]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light.
[02:28:03.028 --> 02:28:04.909]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:10.491]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:28:10.971 --> 02:28:16.898]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:28:17.158 --> 02:28:18.880]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:28:19.141 --> 02:28:22.324]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:28:22.504 --> 02:28:26.409]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:28:26.669 --> 02:28:28.131]  Plus, the service was great.

[02:29:46.286 --> 02:29:50.267]  Have you ever wondered about what the Mark of the Beast is in Chapter 13 of Revelation?
[02:29:50.747 --> 02:29:52.688]  What does 666 really mean?
[02:29:53.228 --> 02:29:54.988]  Or about the Harlot Church of Revelation 17?
[02:29:55.949 --> 02:29:57.769]  Or about the Beast of Daniel in Revelation?
[02:29:58.029 --> 02:30:01.730]  Speculation abounds about these ancient prophecies and what they might mean today.
[02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:10.313]  Now, one of the foremost scholars on geopolitics and popular talk show guest, Dr. Michael Kaufman has just released a DVD called World Events and Prophecy.
[02:30:10.813 --> 02:30:14.834]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is recognized for his penetrating analyses of global events.
[02:30:15.134 --> 02:30:16.655]  Or call toll-free 877-271-7639 That's 877-271-7639 Don't be caught off guard.
[02:30:49.255 --> 02:31:08.827]  Yeah, if you look at when they... There's been whole studies done on this.
[02:31:08.867 --> 02:31:13.110]  When they started vaccinating children with a larger and larger group of shots...
[02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:16.821]  You know, before it was just one or two, then it was five, ten, right at birth.
[02:31:18.461 --> 02:31:28.123]  They started having children die right then, or they would have them die at the second round of shots at six months to eight months, and they'd have the baby go home and die.
[02:31:30.523 --> 02:31:35.824]  And then the American Medical Association comes out and says, Oh, yeah, it's the baby bedding doing this.
[02:31:36.844 --> 02:31:39.305]  No, the parents are really beating them to death.
[02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:43.882]  And so they sent a whole bunch of what was hundreds of parents went to prison.
[02:31:44.143 --> 02:31:48.906]  Then it later all came out that it was genetic disorder causing it.
[02:31:48.926 --> 02:31:50.847]  It all just started right with the vaccines.
[02:31:50.907 --> 02:31:54.509]  But again, everything's fine.
[02:31:54.529 --> 02:31:55.630]  Your government loves you.
[02:31:55.650 --> 02:32:00.393]  So not only do they murder your child because you believe the system and are totally gullible.
[02:32:01.073 --> 02:32:02.174]  Of course, the doctors don't know.
[02:32:02.214 --> 02:32:03.715]  They just believe the system, the nurses.
[02:32:04.115 --> 02:32:04.916]  Just a nation of...
[02:32:07.137 --> 02:32:10.679]  Basically, the New World Order, that's why their symbol is the all-seeing eye on a pyramid.
[02:32:10.739 --> 02:32:17.162]  It's a pyramidal power structure with compartmentalized need-to-know information.
[02:32:17.643 --> 02:32:20.884]  With an eye at the top, it can see and everybody else is blind.
[02:32:23.286 --> 02:32:25.427]  But that eye at the top, it's got all the information.
[02:32:25.467 --> 02:32:26.407]  It sees the plan.
[02:32:26.687 --> 02:32:28.708]  But you can look at what they're doing and see the plan.
[02:32:28.988 --> 02:32:33.671]  The question is, will you have the nerve to admit how horrible it is when you actually behold it?
[02:32:36.067 --> 02:32:36.508]  We're good to go.
[02:32:55.155 --> 02:32:58.656]  And I just want you to share in my anger, and I want to take action against these people.
[02:32:58.896 --> 02:33:04.937]  Because the world's never going to be a perfect place, but Lord knows, if good people don't stand up, things get real bad.
[02:33:05.438 --> 02:33:07.258]  There's no limit to how bad they get.
[02:33:07.938 --> 02:33:13.099]  As Thomas Jefferson said, the exact amount of tyranny you will live under is the amount you put up with.
[02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:15.540]  That's the way it is.
[02:33:15.580 --> 02:33:21.641]  There's always going to be some new evil group that's going to take it even further than the last, who's going to supplant the last ruthless group.
[02:33:22.241 --> 02:33:24.322]  It is survival of the most evil.
[02:33:24.969 --> 02:33:26.250]  And that's who gets into control.
[02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:30.972]  And then you got a bunch of naive people who are just blind to the attack.
[02:33:31.072 --> 02:33:33.433]  Blind to the fact that we're under attack.
[02:33:36.074 --> 02:33:38.955]  You see, the New World Order isn't about manufacturing cars.
[02:33:38.995 --> 02:33:41.196]  It isn't about you having a nice vacation.
[02:33:41.236 --> 02:33:42.657]  It isn't about happy families.
[02:33:42.697 --> 02:33:44.517]  It isn't about milk and honey.
[02:33:44.597 --> 02:33:50.240]  It's about control and dominance of thought, of ideas, of raw materials, of societies.
[02:33:53.635 --> 02:33:54.736]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[02:33:54.956 --> 02:33:58.919]  Let's talk to Kevin in Boston.
[02:33:59.019 --> 02:33:59.700]  Thanks for holding.
[02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:01.622]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:34:02.202 --> 02:34:03.964]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:34:04.224 --> 02:34:06.005]  I wanted to touch on a couple of things.
[02:34:06.065 --> 02:34:09.108]  I don't think I'll take more than, say, a minute and a half.
[02:34:09.408 --> 02:34:21.458]  As far as any Alex Jones errors, Colin, if you can remember, I've been listening faithfully pretty much for the last six years, and the only error I can recall at all was the Anton LaVey carry on the stage hoax, which was
[02:34:22.532 --> 02:34:29.837]  You know, you posted it as a hoax and corrected it within hours of the initial thing coming out, and that's pretty much it.
[02:34:31.097 --> 02:34:39.903]  You not only report carefully on your own things, but you take the time to do careful analysis on what people say on your show when they call in.
[02:34:40.423 --> 02:34:45.306]  As far as what this caller was talking about with the Timothy McVeigh video,
[02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:50.824]  All that your article is asking is that this is enough to reopen the investigation.
[02:34:50.864 --> 02:34:52.045]  I think that's certainly true.
[02:34:52.585 --> 02:34:58.750]  Alternative news sources, as I say, yours what I find is the most neutral, wide open, and unbiased.
[02:34:58.850 --> 02:34:59.651]  I can get on your call.
[02:34:59.691 --> 02:35:01.352]  I'm never screened, not like anywhere else.
[02:35:02.373 --> 02:35:04.094]  It's the best source that I've been able to find.
[02:35:04.134 --> 02:35:04.655]  It's not left.
[02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:05.215]  It's not right.
[02:35:05.896 --> 02:35:08.498]  Other sources I do have some sorts of bias.
[02:35:08.578 --> 02:35:09.779]  I read Rents Daily.
[02:35:10.099 --> 02:35:11.660]  It's a true free speech zone.
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:12.361]  He's been on your show.
[02:35:12.381 --> 02:35:12.841]  He's great.
[02:35:13.325 --> 02:35:23.690]  But some stuff's absolutely true, but he's a wide-open free speech area where some of the stuff's speculative and can be out there, and he doesn't try to restrict it to be true.
[02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:24.890]  It's open for speculation.
[02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:37.075]  Some folks that you've taken issue with that I listened to, Lenny Bloom over in Cloak & Dagger and his Tom Hennigan and those folks, you know, rents can be accused sometimes, failure, rent failure, being anti-Semitic.
[02:35:37.215 --> 02:35:42.898]  Cloak & Dagger certainly takes an anti-Catholic Vatican, anti-Vatican stance.
[02:35:43.368 --> 02:35:46.709]  I'm Catholic, but I still listen to what their viewpoint is, what they have to say.
[02:35:46.729 --> 02:35:47.950]  They're more speculative true.
[02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:53.972]  They'll report rumors, and therefore they're vulnerable, which has been proven, to disinfo and misinfo.
[02:35:54.773 --> 02:35:59.755]  They are openly pro-French New World Order, Patrick Fitzgerald investigation type stuff.
[02:36:00.775 --> 02:36:01.615]  He's going to fix everything.
[02:36:01.635 --> 02:36:03.456]  He's going to indict everybody, and then it doesn't happen.
[02:36:04.617 --> 02:36:11.479]  They've also attacked you as being sympathetic and too pro-Vatican biased, perhaps just because you're friends with Mel Gibson.
[02:36:11.499 --> 02:36:12.540]  They have a problem with that or something.
[02:36:12.620 --> 02:36:12.960]  I don't know.
[02:36:13.359 --> 02:36:27.240]  But they do reveal some good info, such as the fact that Barack Obama's wife is a lobbyist for LaSalle National Bank, which is part of investigations related to the funding of all some of this covert black op activity.
[02:36:29.016 --> 02:36:30.737]  I think I've seen John McCain.
[02:36:30.777 --> 02:36:34.340]  John McCain's a puppet of the Phoenix, Arizona mobster network.
[02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:38.723]  Kemper Marley was the mobster that... Oh, no, they call him anti-corruption.
[02:36:38.743 --> 02:36:40.064]  He's part of the Keating Five.
[02:36:40.504 --> 02:36:41.064]  Absolutely.
[02:36:41.144 --> 02:36:44.146]  He's part of the Sam Brompton Illuminati.
[02:36:44.166 --> 02:36:46.028]  Mr. Anti-Corruption, Al Capone.
[02:36:46.848 --> 02:36:59.097]  And, you know, Kemper Marley had a guy go to jail, Jim Hensley, and when he was defended, Marley himself avoided that prosecution because he was defended by William Rehnquist, who goes on to become Supreme Court Justice.
[02:36:59.637 --> 02:37:02.199]  Don Bowles... Well, let me briefly go back to the McVeigh thing.
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:09.945]  See, we're so busy here that we don't even have time to do the best job we could if we had the time.
[02:37:10.954 --> 02:37:22.087]  I was online and looking at pictures of McVeigh and the Army with this deep tan, a little bit beefier, and today I pulled the photos up.
[02:37:22.668 --> 02:37:26.172]  Total spitting image with this video we've got.
[02:37:26.593 --> 02:37:30.938]  More so than comparing him to the guy that's been in a jail cell for two years.
[02:37:31.847 --> 02:37:39.009]  So, we're going to be posting that with the video as well and up on the site on prisonplanet.com and jonesreport.com in the next few hours.
[02:37:39.449 --> 02:37:41.270]  Wait until you see these photos next to it.
[02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:47.252]  Evidence that has caused reason for a reopening of that investigation.
[02:37:47.292 --> 02:37:48.452]  More evidence has come forward.
[02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:51.333]  We're just reporting on a national news publication that's reported on it.
[02:37:52.113 --> 02:38:00.756]  The final point I wanted to make is you were talking about your site is non-violent and I want to advocate that and non-reactionary
[02:38:01.997 --> 02:38:14.899]  They want to provoke us into being wild, but at the same time, I would ask people not to necessarily join anything, not to post anything, but to just look at the site, awrm.org, and read through it.
[02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:17.700]  Okay, listen, I've got to move on to other callers.
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:18.860]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:21.681]  But still, this is inward looking.
[02:38:23.181 --> 02:38:29.402]  I would have to say half the reportage going on in the alternative medium
[02:38:31.048 --> 02:38:32.328]  Is about ourselves.
[02:38:33.949 --> 02:38:37.990]  And by that I mean nitpicking, everyone attacking everyone.
[02:38:38.050 --> 02:38:38.810]  We don't do it here.
[02:38:39.810 --> 02:38:43.991]  People attack us all the time and we don't respond.
[02:38:44.031 --> 02:38:45.632]  A lot of times mainstream media attacks.
[02:38:45.652 --> 02:38:46.972]  People are like, why aren't you responding?
[02:38:48.332 --> 02:38:51.453]  Because that's not what the broadcast is about.
[02:38:53.308 --> 02:38:54.689]  We're looking at the New World Order.
[02:38:54.709 --> 02:38:58.370]  We're fighting the big admitted systems that are in front of us.
[02:38:58.510 --> 02:39:02.311]  And most of the people attacking and running around are just egomaniacs.
[02:39:04.312 --> 02:39:06.913]  Most of them aren't COINTELPRO or disinfo operatives.
[02:39:07.473 --> 02:39:10.914]  They're just egomaniacs, and they hate everybody else, and it's all about their ego.
[02:39:11.875 --> 02:39:12.195]  Okay?
[02:39:13.835 --> 02:39:15.956]  But there are disinfo groups out there.
[02:39:15.976 --> 02:39:18.577]  You saw them lose their funding in the last three months with the election.
[02:39:18.617 --> 02:39:19.437]  That's pretty funny.
[02:39:19.477 --> 02:39:21.578]  They all rose like coal sores at the end of that.
[02:39:23.086 --> 02:39:23.666]  We're good to go.
[02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:50.772]  And we've got to do all this, and everybody's bad, but me, me, me, me.
[02:39:51.192 --> 02:40:14.101]  Well, the truth is we've got a nation of people that are starting to wake up that are good people, that love God and love their country, and they just want to get you, instead of fighting the New World Order, instead of organizing and meeting and having organizations and groups and rallies and putting out media materials, they want you just constantly ninnying and nitpicking and...
[02:40:15.868 --> 02:40:16.909]  You know, doing all of this.
[02:40:19.630 --> 02:40:22.131]  And that's why other radio networks don't go anywhere.
[02:40:22.151 --> 02:40:25.053]  Other patriot networks in the past.
[02:40:26.333 --> 02:40:29.875]  If they ever figured out not to do it, they'd shoot up like a rocket, which I wish they would.
[02:40:29.895 --> 02:40:37.279]  You know, a lot of it is seen as a business thing.
[02:40:37.779 --> 02:40:39.800]  You know, other people make films, other people...
[02:40:41.414 --> 02:40:41.994]  Write books.
[02:40:42.014 --> 02:40:43.555]  Other people have radio networks.
[02:40:43.675 --> 02:40:45.036]  And the lies.
[02:40:45.957 --> 02:40:47.778]  I don't have time to go listen to it or even read it all.
[02:40:47.818 --> 02:40:50.899]  I just scan it occasionally, and it's so ridiculous.
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:55.862]  And it's kind of good, though, because it's gotten so ridiculous that it's over the top.
[02:40:57.403 --> 02:41:03.447]  You know, it's like Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[02:41:04.887 --> 02:41:06.108]  Reports of my demise.
[02:41:06.168 --> 02:41:09.550]  I mean, every week it's that Genesis isn't going to be here next week, and
[02:41:11.092 --> 02:41:18.335]  And that we're, you know, this and that, and... I think that shows people who we're talking about right there.
[02:41:21.296 --> 02:41:23.857]  These purely destructive business reasons, probably.
[02:41:23.877 --> 02:41:24.937]  It could be something else.
[02:41:24.957 --> 02:41:25.917]  There's some evidence to that.
[02:41:27.558 --> 02:41:33.040]  But in the process of destroying those people, I would shut down a venue that has some good people on it.
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:34.380]  They're not all controlled.
[02:41:35.581 --> 02:41:39.202]  And it would probably give them more attention than they've ever gotten.
[02:41:40.501 --> 02:41:46.982]  I mean, sometimes I don't like to talk about how big we've gotten because I frankly don't want the attention.
[02:41:47.022 --> 02:41:48.422]  I don't want the spotlight on me.
[02:41:48.462 --> 02:41:50.103]  I mean, the New World Order knows, no doubt.
[02:41:52.063 --> 02:41:53.383]  I don't like walking point.
[02:41:53.763 --> 02:41:55.304]  I frankly don't like the attention.
[02:41:55.904 --> 02:41:57.504]  There was a time ten years ago I did.
[02:41:58.224 --> 02:41:59.584]  To an extent, six, seven years ago.
[02:41:59.624 --> 02:42:00.845]  Now I absolutely can't stand it.
[02:42:02.485 --> 02:42:03.705]  People tell me how great I am.
[02:42:03.765 --> 02:42:09.006]  I see an overweight, bleached out, burnt out person who works all the time, who's
[02:42:10.507 --> 02:42:13.069]  Who lives on adrenaline, who's very sad.
[02:42:13.089 --> 02:42:20.576]  And it just kind of disgusts me because I don't have a very big view of myself.
[02:42:20.616 --> 02:42:23.859]  And I'm just like, oh, please stop telling me how good I am.
[02:42:23.939 --> 02:42:26.281]  Please, for God's sakes, just man the guns with me.
[02:42:26.982 --> 02:42:28.163]  Help me fight the New World Order.
[02:42:28.203 --> 02:42:29.985]  Please, please, please.
[02:42:31.426 --> 02:42:32.407]  It's for my family.
[02:42:32.427 --> 02:42:33.728]  It's for your family.
[02:42:35.757 --> 02:42:39.179]  I mean, I can't believe stuff the Patriot community lets people get away with, either.
[02:42:39.279 --> 02:42:42.080]  I mean, just unbelievable stuff on the radio.
[02:42:43.621 --> 02:42:45.682]  Stuff that's just off the charts bad.
[02:42:47.262 --> 02:42:54.065]  But in a sick level, a lot of these people out there who've sought leadership positions, even at minion level, they like infighting.
[02:42:54.105 --> 02:42:58.187]  They like that type of stuff.
[02:42:58.227 --> 02:42:59.408]  It's entertainment to them.
[02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:06.843]  And again, because I show people their true face, I'm the bad man.
[02:43:09.025 --> 02:43:09.626]  I'm the bad man.
[02:43:10.466 --> 02:43:12.948]  Well, if I need to be the bad man, that's fine.
[02:43:13.088 --> 02:43:13.829]  I don't care.
[02:43:13.849 --> 02:43:17.172]  So let's just say I'm bad.
[02:43:17.192 --> 02:43:21.856]  And Lord knows I am, folks.
[02:43:22.056 --> 02:43:23.097]  We're all pretty darn bad.
[02:43:25.211 --> 02:43:28.172]  And so let's just not argue the subject.
[02:43:28.192 --> 02:43:29.053]  It's kind of like with the government.
[02:43:29.073 --> 02:43:32.014]  I go, okay, let's say Jet Fuel did bring down Tower 1 and 2.
[02:43:32.074 --> 02:43:34.495]  We know that didn't happen, but sake of argument, fine.
[02:43:34.875 --> 02:43:36.216]  Well, I'm kind of like Tower 1 and 2.
[02:43:36.516 --> 02:43:37.556]  Let's just say I'm bad.
[02:43:37.596 --> 02:43:40.698]  Okay, now can we please look at Building 7 over here?
[02:43:40.938 --> 02:43:46.000]  Will you please stop spending half your time out there nitpicking and nimmying around?
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:49.421]  And will you please help me here at the front lines fight the New World Order?
[02:43:50.762 --> 02:43:52.302]  Okay, you don't want to fight next to me?
[02:43:52.322 --> 02:43:52.402]  Then...
[02:43:55.034 --> 02:43:56.035]  You at least go fight!
[02:43:59.657 --> 02:44:01.558]  You see, you've been engineered to lose.
[02:44:02.358 --> 02:44:05.160]  We've been built to be a bunch of ninnying cowards.
[02:44:09.563 --> 02:44:10.944]  And ninnying is the word.
[02:44:10.964 --> 02:44:15.106]  Ninnying is the word.
[02:44:19.249 --> 02:44:23.091]  And if people don't like to hear me say land of the coward, home of the slaves, I'll just say it more.
[02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:33.335]  Because if we're ever going to get back to being land of the free, home of the brave, we have to admit how disgustingly pathetic we've gotten!
[02:44:33.355 --> 02:44:46.423]  I want, my soul literally cries out, burns with the desire to protect these innocent women and children.
[02:44:46.463 --> 02:44:47.523]  That is my instinct.
[02:44:47.603 --> 02:44:49.925]  That is what a man, a warrior is.
[02:44:52.648 --> 02:44:56.030]  And all I want to do is protect the weak.
[02:44:58.151 --> 02:45:01.633]  And I feel violent towards the strong that abuse the weak.
[02:45:04.934 --> 02:45:07.976]  I like taking bullies and knocking them down to size.
[02:45:08.796 --> 02:45:10.717]  I like seeing bad cops lose their job.
[02:45:10.777 --> 02:45:12.378]  I like seeing congressmen go to prison.
[02:45:12.798 --> 02:45:15.399]  But I tell you, I'd like to see David Rockefeller go to prison.
[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:17.821]  I'd like to see Lord Rothschild go to prison.
[02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:20.082]  I'd like to see that blasphemous whore
[02:45:22.961 --> 02:45:25.082]  Of the New World Order, Queen Elizabeth.
[02:45:27.062 --> 02:45:39.425]  And I look at the six systems that serve these people and these selfish husks of humanity, these cowards, these hordes of cowards that serve evil, and I just hate your guts.
[02:45:40.425 --> 02:45:42.446]  But I don't fight you because I hate you.
[02:45:43.286 --> 02:45:46.367]  I fight you because I love the innocent.
[02:45:47.287 --> 02:45:48.847]  And I love beauty.
[02:45:50.268 --> 02:45:51.908]  And I see the magic in life.
[02:45:54.668 --> 02:45:56.449]  And I know life is precious and short.
[02:45:56.489 --> 02:45:57.589]  And I know, I mean, look at us.
[02:45:57.629 --> 02:46:10.774]  We're on this planet orbiting a yellow dwarf sun way out in the hinterland on the edge of the galaxy looking into the galaxy with hundreds of billions of galaxies that have been photographed around us.
[02:46:11.014 --> 02:46:12.454]  We're here one time.
[02:46:12.734 --> 02:46:15.375]  Big, deep blue oceans filled with life.
[02:46:16.156 --> 02:46:19.757]  Trees, forests, clouds, sunsets, all of it.
[02:46:21.152 --> 02:46:27.674]  And all I want is people to be able to live and work the land and work in factories and be happy and have good lives.
[02:46:27.874 --> 02:46:28.754]  It's like that song.
[02:46:28.994 --> 02:46:35.636]  There's another kid that'll never get to go to school, never get to have friends, never get to be cool.
[02:46:35.916 --> 02:46:36.817]  Can you cue up that song?
[02:46:36.837 --> 02:46:37.797]  I want to play that right now.
[02:46:37.857 --> 02:46:38.937]  Just the first few minutes of it.
[02:46:43.599 --> 02:46:48.440]  I mean, man has got enough problems without an elite that tries to foster and push every weakness in us.
[02:46:49.747 --> 02:46:52.929]  Because it makes us easier to manage when we're a bunch of braying cattle.
[02:46:52.949 --> 02:47:16.163]  And I see a bunch of wannabe macho men that think it's tough to have arm wrestling contests with other patriots and other people and who think it's cute to run around talking about how they're holier than thou and they've got the nerve to tell me what I should do when I know without a shadow of a doubt I work harder than any of them.
[02:47:17.270 --> 02:47:22.652]  And when I, frankly, woke up, almost every one of them, look at the fruit this is bore.
[02:47:22.872 --> 02:47:24.593]  And let me tell you, this tree is sickly.
[02:47:24.953 --> 02:47:31.675]  But compared to what you've done, compared to most of what you've done, I've brought in more fruit than a thousand of you combined out there.
[02:47:33.236 --> 02:47:34.316]  And the fruit's good.
[02:47:34.556 --> 02:47:37.577]  It's about recognizing the attack we're under and what we face.
[02:47:38.078 --> 02:47:39.118]  We'll come back with that song.
[02:47:49.844 --> 02:47:52.345]  And this is a healthy discussion today because it isn't about me.
[02:47:53.245 --> 02:47:57.146]  It's about all of us getting our heads screwed on straight.
[02:48:00.668 --> 02:48:11.791]  It's like people who sit around and say there's some big job to do complaining about the right way to do it and a lot of people will just have a fight with each other because it's easier to throw a fit and run off and not start digging into the job and getting it done.
[02:48:11.811 --> 02:48:16.413]  I mean, I want to puke.
[02:48:17.862 --> 02:48:31.570]  Every time I get a phone call or an email or a letter telling me what better I need to do, what more I need to do, nitpicking, people that have never done nothing, you're going to be in a world of hurt a lot worse than it is now.
[02:48:33.151 --> 02:48:40.456]  If you don't become a leader and get involved right now, put your shoulder to the wheel.
[02:48:41.376 --> 02:48:43.918]  Final segment, final call, straight ahead.
[02:48:49.156 --> 02:48:52.298]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.678 --> 02:48:54.599]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.619 --> 02:48:59.482]  It's orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:00.163 --> 02:49:07.207]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:07.607 --> 02:49:10.569]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:10.889 --> 02:49:13.270]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:14.511]  NSA spies.

[02:49:42.580 --> 02:49:47.662]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:49:47.722 --> 02:49:55.025]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:49:55.185 --> 02:50:05.810]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:50:06.010 --> 02:50:10.552]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:50:10.832 --> 02:50:15.838]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:50:16.038 --> 02:50:18.982]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:19.202 --> 02:50:29.033]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:52:08.425 --> 02:52:09.186]  We're good to go.
[02:53:32.618 --> 02:53:34.039]  Segment.
[02:53:34.199 --> 02:53:42.746]  Another kid will never get ahead, never get to go to school, never get to be cool.
[02:53:58.311 --> 02:54:00.833]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you again.
[02:54:24.813 --> 02:54:27.694]  I was just going to say, I went to a couple things really quick here.
[02:54:27.954 --> 02:54:31.015]  I went to a 9-11 Truth meeting here in Houston last night.
[02:54:31.035 --> 02:54:33.736]  There were probably about 20 people, obviously.
[02:54:33.796 --> 02:54:35.037]  The goal is to get that number up a lot.
[02:54:35.557 --> 02:54:38.158]  But we were just talking about places to go for information.
[02:54:38.178 --> 02:54:39.218]  Your name came up quite a bit.
[02:54:39.278 --> 02:54:40.959]  I was just going to tell you something throughout there.
[02:54:40.979 --> 02:54:45.080]  Well, he's one of those UFO guys, and I just want you to know that I definitely corrected him on that.
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:46.981]  I just get amazed at me where people get this stuff.
[02:54:47.041 --> 02:54:48.682]  Because the enemy's attacking me, brother.
[02:54:48.702 --> 02:54:52.323]  And the power of the enemy's attack is people then parrot it.
[02:54:53.248 --> 02:54:54.368]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:54:54.408 --> 02:54:58.509]  And it's like, well, okay, we're your source for that.
[02:54:58.649 --> 02:55:04.450]  One thing I wanted to ask you, this is like a, I'm not trying to be nitpicky here, I just have a serious question that I think you've probably thought about, too.
[02:55:04.570 --> 02:55:05.450]  Yeah, we're almost out of time.
[02:55:05.490 --> 02:55:06.031]  Go ahead and ask it.
[02:55:06.511 --> 02:55:07.131]  Okay, good.
[02:55:07.171 --> 02:55:20.894]  People like, I've seen Morgan Reynolds and David Taylor at the end of the thing, and I think they've given some valuable information, but why, like, I've seen like three-minute segments where they're on cable news channels, and they'll bring up the fake plane thing, or the planes were weird, and I just think there's so much evidence to prove it's an inside job.
[02:55:20.934 --> 02:55:22.834]  Yeah, they didn't do that until now.
[02:55:23.829 --> 02:55:26.970]  And they didn't do that when I interviewed them for Terror Storm almost a year ago.
[02:55:27.610 --> 02:55:34.071]  Well, eight months ago for one, over a year and a quarter ago for the other.
[02:55:35.311 --> 02:55:37.312]  Hey, have discernment, sir.
[02:55:37.332 --> 02:55:38.472]  Take care.
[02:55:39.012 --> 02:55:39.852]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[02:55:40.972 --> 02:55:42.773]  I apologize to Tom and Jeff and others.
[02:55:42.793 --> 02:55:44.113]  You'll have to call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:44.833 --> 02:55:46.153]  That was a good broadcast today.
