[00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:06.167]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:07.888]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:09.708]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:11.169]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:12.829]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.111]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:21.793]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.953 --> 00:00:23.233]  Music
[00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:40.248]  Well, I've been gone for a couple days and I'm going to make up for that now.
[00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:49.056]  I'm very glad, very thankful that you have decided to spend time with us and to join us on this 18th day of December 2006.
[00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:58.064]  Genesis Radio talk show host was waylaid by the police and arrested over the weekend.
[00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:01.788]  We'll get into that story at the bottom of this hour.
[00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:05.153]  We did have a documentary filmmaker who was at a U.S.
[00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:09.215]  military base one year after McVeigh had supposedly left the military.
[00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.316]  It was a U.S.
[00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:21.442]  military base specializing in demolition, and he videotaped, and we now have the video and stills going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com today.
[00:01:22.062 --> 00:01:25.204]  We now have these and are getting them up on the site right now.
[00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:31.187]  Proof of McVeigh still in the military at a demolitions training school.
[00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:32.774]  On a U.S.
[00:01:32.794 --> 00:01:33.474]  military base.
[00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:36.297]  You've got to give credit where credit is due.
[00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:37.638]  Guess who broke this story?
[00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:52.871]  It's just now coming out, and we were contacted by the editor at Hustler Magazine, the only folks out there in mainstream media land that had the courage to put this report out.
[00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:58.296]  So I really don't want to hear criticisms that, oh, you're interviewing someone whose report got in Hustler.
[00:01:59.368 --> 00:02:04.331]  By hook or by crook, we are getting this information out to the American people.
[00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:06.152]  And we're doing a report on it today.
[00:02:07.012 --> 00:02:15.716]  The editor over at the magazine was very gracious to contact us and put us in contact with the man who was at the base and shot the video of this.
[00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:20.559]  The video came in over the weekend.
[00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:25.874]  And I guess my folks were waiting for me to tell them what to do with it, but we're in there right now.
[00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:27.855]  We've got the stills in the video.
[00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:35.658]  Strangely enough, the video is acting weird in several of our DVD players because it's on a different format, but we are struggling to get it captured.
[00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:45.141]  And I did just see McVay's little face there in a Humvee right before I ran into the studio to do the live radio transmission.
[00:02:46.122 --> 00:02:46.862]  And so we have...
[00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:52.672]  The filmmaker who was there at the base joining us in the second hour.
[00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:53.753]  This is huge.
[00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:56.395]  We know McVeigh was a U.S.
[00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:59.757]  government agent, just like the supposed hijackers were.
[00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:04.880]  We know that he'd been sheep-dipped or brought into covert operations that staged his discharge.
[00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:09.463]  We know that the Iraqis involved in the operation were brought into the U.S.
[00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.584]  at the end of the Gulf War and are U.S.
[00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:13.145]  government agents and were protected.
[00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.848]  And we know there are 5,000 Iraqis in this country right now
[00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:25.822]  And if the New World Order gives a simple order, they will blow up chemical plants, police facilities, federal buildings, coast to coast.
[00:03:26.242 --> 00:03:32.484]  The New World Order can bring the country to its knees within a matter of hours, and this is what they've always had planned.
[00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:37.525]  They have many other contingency operations to destroy our infrastructure instantly.
[00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:43.287]  And so the police and military need to know who's going to do it when they do it.
[00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:50.319]  But I know you'll just be patriotic and wave a plastic desecrated American flag made by a Chinese slave and won't listen to me.
[00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:55.021]  You'll probably put me in a FEMA camp for trying to warn you and trying to save this country.
[00:03:55.281 --> 00:04:05.245]  I understand what it's like to be an evil American Al-Qaeda now, as Laura Ingraham and others have said, because I know Al-Qaeda is Al-CIA.
[00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.306]  I'm a bad person, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:12.928]  I have committed many, many crimes here.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.681]  Of trying to save the Republic.
[00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:18.462]  So that's coming up in the second hour.
[00:04:18.582 --> 00:04:26.787]  Just unbelievable exclusive that has been shared with us by Larry Flint.
[00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:30.769]  I'll tell you, truth is stranger than fiction here.
[00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.510]  New Oklahoma City bombing evidence.
[00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.071]  Was there a government cover-up?
[00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:39.253]  And it goes into it in great detail.
[00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:42.695]  Unbelievable issue here.
[00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:46.747]  And no, I'm not talking about Jenna Jamison being unbelievable.
[00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.909]  This report is unbelievable.
[00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:58.557]  And then we have another huge guest, Professor Francis A. Boyle joining us about the government launching the anthrax attacks in the third hour.
[00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:07.537]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.897 --> 00:05:09.838]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:17.863]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.543 --> 00:05:25.588]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:28.910]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.631]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.052 --> 00:05:32.892]  NSA spies.

[00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:56.293]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:03.189]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:05.610]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.192]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:10.772 --> 00:07:17.254]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse, or adding machine.

[00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.200]  WristEase is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:40.723]  WristEase provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and makes a great stocking stuffer.

[00:07:50.766 --> 00:07:57.048]  That's WristEase, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, WristEase.com.
[00:07:57.188 --> 00:07:58.929]  Once again, WristEase.com.
[00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.071]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:07.792]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.513 --> 00:08:09.654]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:09.674 --> 00:08:11.095]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.836 --> 00:08:12.676]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.736 --> 00:08:17.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.664]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:40.257]  Coming up in the third hour, the one o'clock hour Central Standard Time, we're going to be interviewing Francis A. Boyle.
[00:08:41.498 --> 00:08:44.560]  He's written the book, Destroying World Order, U.S.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.063]  Imperialism in the Middle East, before and after September 11th.
[00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:51.105]  And let me tell you a little bit about him.
[00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:53.247]  U.S.
[00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:56.609]  Government Biological Weapons Legislator says 2001...
[00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:02.320]  Anthrax attacks, part of government bio-warfare program.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.342]  Now, we already knew this, but he's a real expert.
[00:09:05.822 --> 00:09:13.708]  Expert says FBI covered up the plot to attack Congress, which may have been perpetrated by the same people who carried out September 11th.
[00:09:13.728 --> 00:09:18.051]  This is a big report from Infowars.net that came out last week.
[00:09:18.651 --> 00:09:20.412]  The real culprits behind the 2001 attacks...
[00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:22.564]  We're good to go.
[00:09:40.723 --> 00:09:41.124]  We're good to go.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.080]  We're good to go.
[00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.476]  I think we're good to go.
[00:10:43.972 --> 00:10:45.033]  This came in Friday.
[00:10:45.413 --> 00:10:48.916]  I knew that last week we'd been contacted by the editor.
[00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:57.883]  The editor of Hustler Magazine contacted us and said, we know that you're one of the few outlets that's probably got the courage to run with this.
[00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:02.162]  And I was aware that there had been reports that McVeigh had stayed in the U.S.
[00:11:02.202 --> 00:11:06.744]  military and the Army, that he had been, quote, sheet-dipped.
[00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:09.685]  That's when they stage your death in some radical cases.
[00:11:09.725 --> 00:11:14.607]  In most cases, they discharge you, and then you really carry out covert operations.
[00:11:14.647 --> 00:11:21.369]  You really get brought into the operations of the National Security Council, the President.
[00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:23.410]  Sometimes you work for the CIA.
[00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.871]  Sometimes you work for private corporations.
[00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:27.112]  We're good to go.
[00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:27.432]  I think?
[00:11:48.843 --> 00:11:49.963]  I mean, we have that.
[00:11:50.063 --> 00:11:53.745]  In fact, we've got to go to America Destroyed by Design, Kevin, after you leave during this segment.
[00:11:53.765 --> 00:11:57.166]  Tell Aaron later after he's posted the photos, posted the video of McVeigh.
[00:11:57.186 --> 00:11:59.967]  This is bombshell stuff, folks.
[00:12:00.047 --> 00:12:01.087]  Huge exclusive here.
[00:12:03.468 --> 00:12:11.771]  I just thought of that Camp Gruber video we have of the rider truck at the base.
[00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.072]  I had forgotten about that.
[00:12:15.173 --> 00:12:16.353]  So we need to integrate that.
[00:12:17.228 --> 00:12:20.471]  But this is a documentary filmmaker who was at another base.
[00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:24.474]  This is a year after McVeigh supposedly got out of the Army.
[00:12:24.695 --> 00:12:26.556]  Ooh, been discharged.
[00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:27.757]  He didn't do a good job.
[00:12:27.817 --> 00:12:28.478]  He's bad.
[00:12:28.818 --> 00:12:34.463]  Here he is in his uniform running around at a base that specializes in demolitions training.
[00:12:35.884 --> 00:12:37.485]  This is unbelievable.
[00:12:37.786 --> 00:12:37.926]  And...
[00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:41.838]  This should be on every national television program.
[00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:43.881]  It should be in every newspaper, every magazine.
[00:12:44.622 --> 00:12:47.145]  And we're here trying to force this over the edge.
[00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:52.251]  This will not be the first time that Hustler Magazine has broken national stories.
[00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:54.294]  They've exposed a lot of pervert Republicans.
[00:12:55.092 --> 00:13:02.343]  They've exposed countless stories that go national, and I hope and pray that this story does go national.
[00:13:02.784 --> 00:13:05.928]  Larry Flint, love him or hate him, say what you want about him.
[00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:07.350]  I'm Larry Flint.
[00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.235]  I interviewed him about, what was it, eight, nine years ago.
[00:13:11.701 --> 00:13:13.223]  Say what you want about Larry Flint.
[00:13:13.463 --> 00:13:16.425]  The guy certainly is not controlled and does whatever he wants.
[00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:27.132]  And he's got a huge article basically coming out saying that all the evidence points towards the government being involved in the attacks.
[00:13:28.153 --> 00:13:30.795]  And that's the evidence that we have.
[00:13:30.835 --> 00:13:33.937]  And I can only commend their editor, who I've had a chance to talk to.
[00:13:33.997 --> 00:13:35.118]  He's a listener to the show.
[00:13:35.138 --> 00:13:39.661]  In fact, he says he listens daily there at the office, the head honcho over there.
[00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.603]  And here it is, hard-hitting reporting.
[00:13:43.123 --> 00:13:50.466]  And yes, coming up in the new year, there's going to be a cover story about 9-11 being an inside job in hustlers.
[00:13:50.586 --> 00:13:55.588]  So I guess Larry Flint knows what sells, and that's the truth.
[00:13:57.089 --> 00:13:58.550]  All is being born here.
[00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.430]  It's being laid bare.
[00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:06.053]  Let me tell you, I don't normally have a hustler on my desk.
[00:14:07.234 --> 00:14:08.395]  I do here in front of me.
[00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:14.860]  But this type of reporting could bring down the New World Order.
[00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:21.985]  Kevin Smith, tell us about the gentleman that's joining us coming up in 45 minutes and 40 seconds.
[00:14:22.546 --> 00:14:26.208]  Well, I heavily redacted that hustler for you so you won't see any naughty bits.
[00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:27.269]  Just the stories, Alex.
[00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:28.350]  That's right.
[00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:32.593]  In fact, you've given me... You've reprieved me here.
[00:14:33.013 --> 00:14:33.594]  The torture...
[00:14:35.489 --> 00:14:41.011]  ...of the female form, so I can simply... You've got me a Xerox copy of this.
[00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:46.672]  Now, you've been talking to the editor a lot more than I have, because I was out of town last week, and I talked to him briefly last week before I left.
[00:14:48.733 --> 00:14:52.294]  Now, we're going to write our own story, and really they're giving us an exclusive.
[00:14:52.614 --> 00:14:55.635]  We have been sent video that they obviously can't put in a magazine.
[00:14:56.555 --> 00:14:58.776]  We have video of McVeigh...
[00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:02.689]  And Murphy's Law, it is crashing in our computer.
[00:15:02.709 --> 00:15:03.450]  We've had this before.
[00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.474]  It's some type of DVD format, but we're getting bits and pieces of it.
[00:15:08.175 --> 00:15:10.617]  It looks like we were able to capture the video of McVeigh.
[00:15:10.657 --> 00:15:11.298]  I have seen it.
[00:15:11.618 --> 00:15:13.179]  We have stills of McVeigh at the base.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.221]  This guy is a documentary filmmaker.
[00:15:15.642 --> 00:15:21.608]  It's on record that he saw McVeigh, and he's speaking out now, and this fits in with all the other intel we have.
[00:15:21.928 --> 00:15:23.930]  Give us a brief rundown, Kevin, of what's coming up.
[00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:39.930]  Well, you're going to hear from William Bean, and he was in South Dakota scouting this location for a movie, and he just was going about his business filming scenes, and he had some interaction with troops, and this base specializes in engineering and demolitions.
[00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.810]  And this fellow turns around.
[00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.171]  It looks like a Humvee or some sort of half-track vehicle.
[00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:46.092]  And it looks like McVeigh.
[00:15:46.172 --> 00:15:47.532]  It really looks like McVeigh.
[00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:54.334]  And the problem is, this is in the late summer of 1993, a full year after he was supposedly out of the military.
[00:15:54.734 --> 00:15:55.434]  He came back.
[00:15:55.474 --> 00:15:58.875]  He got a Bronze Star in the first Gulf War.
[00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:00.055]  He came back.
[00:16:00.095 --> 00:16:01.736]  He tried out for Special Forces.
[00:16:02.196 --> 00:16:04.256]  Apparently didn't make it into Special Forces.
[00:16:04.316 --> 00:16:07.237]  He says he was assigned to a Special Project Group.
[00:16:07.737 --> 00:16:08.337]  We're good to go.
[00:16:08.357 --> 00:16:08.577]  I think?
[00:16:26.983 --> 00:16:27.524]  We're good to go.
[00:16:44.446 --> 00:16:45.306]  We're good to go.
[00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:45.466]  I think?
[00:17:04.443 --> 00:17:06.364]  We've been talking to Mark Johnson at Hustler.
[00:17:07.224 --> 00:17:10.766]  This actually just came out this month, even though it's the February issue.
[00:17:11.246 --> 00:17:16.929]  So we wanted to hold off until it made it into newsprint, and then come on and bring Bill Bean on.
[00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:18.810]  And you mentioned the 9-11 articles.
[00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:26.873]  That will actually hit the newsstands and subscribers January 9th, and it is the March issue, and it's a big expose on 9-11.
[00:17:26.993 --> 00:17:30.355]  So hats off to Larry Flint and Mark Johnson.
[00:17:31.143 --> 00:17:34.024]  Yeah, this is powerful, though.
[00:17:34.044 --> 00:17:36.484]  I mean, reading over this article, I mean, there it is.
[00:17:36.564 --> 00:17:41.646]  That is Timothy McVeigh, 110% looking right out of the armored vehicle.
[00:17:42.246 --> 00:17:43.406]  I mean, that's him right there.
[00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:48.227]  But, folks, we've got the photos digitally for them for you going up.
[00:17:48.287 --> 00:17:49.848]  We've got the video going up.
[00:17:50.248 --> 00:17:54.689]  Paul Watson, later in the afternoon, will have a report done on this.
[00:17:55.883 --> 00:17:58.566]  And this is just huge.
[00:17:58.646 --> 00:18:02.430]  Bill Bean has a lot of courage, and what he's doing is going to make him a lot safer.
[00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:07.555]  By the way, when I was out of town, I did get a call, and now I have his name of the source.
[00:18:09.243 --> 00:18:25.128]  With the muckraker report, who heard the Israelis speaking in Hebrew there at that New Jersey cemetery months before 9-11, saying when the towers come down, they'll know what terrorism is like.
[00:18:25.269 --> 00:18:29.450]  I now have gotten a message from him, I've got his full name, and we're now in negotiations.
[00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:30.631]  We're good to go.
[00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:47.418]  We're good to go.
[00:18:47.438 --> 00:18:47.658]  I think?
[00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:13.808]  Did you scan this to make me copies of this article?
[00:19:13.948 --> 00:19:15.649]  Just use the copier out of the magazine.
[00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:33.679]  Yeah, why don't you, so Paul has this, can you scan this and shoot these over to Watson, or shoot him the text somehow, so that he can work off of their report too, so we can get a report out on this as quickly as possible.
[00:19:33.699 --> 00:19:38.181]  I mean, this is live here at this office, just a few people, and we're doing the amount of reporting of...
[00:19:40.766 --> 00:19:42.807]  20 or 30 people here at the office.
[00:19:43.687 --> 00:19:46.408]  All right, now get this devilish magazine out of here.
[00:19:47.288 --> 00:19:49.309]  Oh, that catches the building on fire.
[00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:54.191]  All right, we'll be right back, get into the national news, the local news.
[00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:58.672]  We've got Jack Blood, who was beat up by the cops, coming on the transmission as well.
[00:19:58.712 --> 00:19:59.532]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.814 --> 00:20:06.035]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:20:08.524 --> 00:20:13.347]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:20:13.547 --> 00:20:16.289]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:20:16.329 --> 00:20:17.450]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:20:18.791 --> 00:20:23.393]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:31.579]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:35.641]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:41.234]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:20:53.546 --> 00:20:53.967]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.987 --> 00:20:54.207]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:06.501]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:21:06.561 --> 00:21:13.887]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:24.656]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:21:24.876 --> 00:21:29.420]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.561]  We're good to go.

[00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:04.371]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.152 --> 00:22:10.757]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:11.538]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:12.307 --> 00:22:16.608]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:22:16.648 --> 00:22:20.249]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:21.249 --> 00:22:26.511]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[00:23:04.462 --> 00:23:06.403]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:06.903 --> 00:23:09.285]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:18.516]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:19.476 --> 00:23:24.379]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Incorporated's patented methodology.

[00:24:04.457 --> 00:24:30.173]  Day after day Alone on a hill The man with the foolish grin Is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill
[00:24:30.785 --> 00:24:32.386]  We're good to go.
[00:24:32.446 --> 00:24:34.687]  We're good to go.
[00:24:51.472 --> 00:24:53.474]  Welcome back.
[00:24:53.954 --> 00:25:10.625]  Jack Blood got roughed up by the Lordships Saturday night here in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:10.685 --> 00:25:16.930]  And it's just a classic story of where Jack saw a guy getting beat up, so he went to the person's aid.
[00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.352]  The attackers, I guess the muggers or whatever they are, ran off.
[00:25:21.067 --> 00:25:25.089]  And then he simply helped the man who had his nose broken and had to go to the hospital.
[00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:37.657]  And when the cops showed up, they just went ahead and maced him and then took him to jail and then forced him to give a urine sample so they could then try to use that against him, hoping something was in his urine.
[00:25:38.918 --> 00:25:39.718]  This is America.
[00:25:39.758 --> 00:25:41.019]  This is the world, though.
[00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:43.560]  This is the predatory system.
[00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:45.541]  And...
[00:25:47.125 --> 00:25:49.847]  This weekend, I was in Los Angeles.
[00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:51.429]  Well, you know I wasn't here Thursday or Friday.
[00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.089]  I left Thursday.
[00:25:52.109 --> 00:25:52.850]  It was on business.
[00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:55.272]  But I did have some time to watch television.
[00:25:55.312 --> 00:26:14.869]  I tend to watch television because in between meetings, I just sit there in the hotel room for a couple hours at a stretch, and I was watching news, and I saw a cop show where a fella pulled over on the side of a country road, but a surveillance camera was picking it up,
[00:26:15.743 --> 00:26:16.903]  To use the bathroom.
[00:26:16.943 --> 00:26:17.744]  This was in England.
[00:26:18.504 --> 00:26:19.684]  And he was urinating.
[00:26:20.725 --> 00:26:27.287]  And the police pull over, and they ticket him, and it went on to say that he would be charged with a sexual offense.
[00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:36.130]  Then I was watching another cop show the next day, a totally separate one, and it showed them giving someone a ticket in England again.
[00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.891]  So this must be what the surveillance cameras are for.
[00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:43.173]  And I thought back to the big road trips we would take when I was a child.
[00:26:43.213 --> 00:26:43.513]  We would...
[00:26:44.981 --> 00:26:46.984]  About twice a year for about two weeks.
[00:26:47.424 --> 00:26:50.328]  Vacation was important to my parents to travel and make sure I was well traveled.
[00:26:50.648 --> 00:26:52.670]  We'd drive from Texas to D.C.
[00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.155]  or we'd drive from Texas to Canada or we'd drive from Texas to the Keys of Florida and back.
[00:26:57.196 --> 00:27:03.383]  Or we'd drive through the southwest and into the mountains and up into Wyoming and Idaho.
[00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:09.746]  And back then, most of you remember this, you saw cars everywhere.
[00:27:09.886 --> 00:27:15.670]  Back then there weren't as many gas stations, but still there were a lot of areas where you won't see a gas station for 200 miles.
[00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:21.253]  People pull over, and they go behind a bush, or you do whatever you can, but you use the bathroom.
[00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:28.198]  And you notice you don't see that anymore, because Americans know you will be charged as a sex offender.
[00:27:29.378 --> 00:27:33.361]  And tens of thousands of people in the sexual predator registry
[00:27:34.395 --> 00:27:40.161]  Sex offender registry is for being caught urinating on the sides of roads.
[00:27:41.402 --> 00:27:56.817]  And that's just an illustration of taking normal behavior, normal behavior, and criminalizing it, criminalizing it, saying you can't do that.
[00:27:57.794 --> 00:27:59.275]  You can't do that.
[00:27:59.315 --> 00:28:01.735]  In fact, I have a... Well, he's dead now, actually.
[00:28:02.756 --> 00:28:11.018]  As a friend of one of my friend's dads, who worked at a chemical plant in Houston, and he had... I don't know why I'm adding that part.
[00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:13.119]  He had diabetes.
[00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:19.761]  And one time around the campfire, he was telling the story when we were deer hunting about how he had to pull over.
[00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:21.561]  This was just, I don't know, like seven, eight years ago.
[00:28:21.581 --> 00:28:23.722]  I guess about nine, ten years ago, actually.
[00:28:23.982 --> 00:28:25.062]  How he had to pull over to...
[00:28:27.464 --> 00:28:28.005]  We're good to go.
[00:28:47.085 --> 00:28:52.546]  And then, of course, there's those police state reports all over the country where you refuse to give a urine or blood sample at the hospital when they take you.
[00:28:52.826 --> 00:28:53.787]  So they taser you.
[00:28:53.807 --> 00:28:55.187]  Remember that big Miami case?
[00:28:55.207 --> 00:28:56.267]  And then it turned out it was happening.
[00:28:56.587 --> 00:28:58.008]  And they call it pain compliance.
[00:28:58.048 --> 00:28:59.108]  And it's no longer torture.
[00:28:59.148 --> 00:29:00.548]  It's pain compliance.
[00:29:01.028 --> 00:29:04.269]  And they keep tasering and tasering until you, quote, submit.
[00:29:06.189 --> 00:29:11.851]  So just an illustration of the police state we live in in Europe and the U.S.
[00:29:11.891 --> 00:29:15.612]  and England where things that just 25, 30 years ago
[00:29:18.115 --> 00:29:18.955]  We're normal.
[00:29:19.375 --> 00:29:23.777]  And you all remember as a child pulling over, and your parents, you had to go.
[00:29:23.797 --> 00:29:25.997]  You know, adults could hold it.
[00:29:26.037 --> 00:29:28.558]  You could, okay, pull over, run over behind that bush.
[00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:32.319]  The whole family gets charged as sex predators.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.020]  Gets you into that system.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.681]  That's what it's all about in America.
[00:29:38.621 --> 00:29:39.241]  Got another one here.
[00:29:39.341 --> 00:29:43.703]  Model pupil ends up with criminal record for a push in the playground.
[00:29:44.123 --> 00:29:44.623]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.405 --> 00:29:52.326]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.806 --> 00:29:54.427]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.327 --> 00:29:58.089]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.131 --> 00:30:04.513]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.362]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:30:08.743 --> 00:30:11.705]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:30:11.965 --> 00:30:18.349]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:22.853]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:30:23.073 --> 00:30:27.436]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:30:27.596 --> 00:30:30.198]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:30:30.218 --> 00:30:32.960]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.982]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:30:36.022 --> 00:30:40.284]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:30:40.324 --> 00:30:41.205]  Treasury bonds.
[00:30:41.445 --> 00:30:46.087]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:30:46.267 --> 00:30:47.908]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:30:47.928 --> 00:30:49.489]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[00:31:01.427 --> 00:31:04.990]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:05.550]  are located?
[00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:09.153]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.373 --> 00:31:14.076]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.356 --> 00:31:19.360]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.642]  Brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.

[00:31:45.527 --> 00:31:47.808]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:00.771 --> 00:32:05.552]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:32:05.772 --> 00:32:09.753]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:32:10.014 --> 00:32:16.315]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:32:16.555 --> 00:32:20.936]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[00:32:21.117 --> 00:32:26.398]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:32.180]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:40.103]  The solar-powered generator will run your lights, fan, electric blanket, your refrigerator, and a whole slew of household items.
[00:32:40.423 --> 00:32:49.086]  Visit Ken's website at Kensolar.com for free downloads, free videos and how-tos, and, of course, the new solar-powered generator.
[00:32:49.346 --> 00:32:49.826]  We're good to go.
[00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:34.307]  I've got a good friend I've known for about six years named Robert.
[00:33:36.148 --> 00:33:39.950]  He's a... Well, he does record work.
[00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:41.130]  He's also a repo man.
[00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.871]  And he's helped us out on some stories.
[00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:45.372]  He's also given us some big stories.
[00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:52.212]  With Austin police forcing strippers to service them when they pull them over for DUIs.
[00:33:52.972 --> 00:33:57.755]  Also, he got us a report where they came into a house and shot the lab a couple times in the head.
[00:33:59.576 --> 00:34:14.823]  Well, he got so sick of this that he mounted his wrecker truck as well as his personal car, something we recommended years ago that a lot of people have done with hidden cameras and a VCR built into the dash.
[00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:16.967]  We're good to go.
[00:34:44.867 --> 00:34:47.508]  And the cops are going, ooh, ooh, ooh, look what I found!
[00:34:47.968 --> 00:34:51.389]  We've got to call in the special units, the anti-terror units.
[00:34:51.409 --> 00:35:01.011]  He gives the code for the anti-terror intelligence squad, because in the glove compartment, after a long search, we've got like 30 minutes, we just put a few minutes up to spare you.
[00:35:01.031 --> 00:35:03.412]  It's up on JonesReport.com right now.
[00:35:06.212 --> 00:35:07.493]  This is the mentality.
[00:35:07.633 --> 00:35:08.833]  This is the mindset.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.362]  And the female cop is joking.
[00:35:12.382 --> 00:35:16.325]  They're like looking in his Gatorade bottle and looks like tea, smells like tea.
[00:35:16.745 --> 00:35:17.726]  She sounds like a gang member.
[00:35:17.746 --> 00:35:18.807]  She goes, shake it up!
[00:35:19.687 --> 00:35:21.749]  In fact, I know I sent you that clip, John.
[00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:22.489]  I forgot to tell you.
[00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.113]  It's the last few minutes of the clip, maybe for the end of this hour.
[00:35:27.613 --> 00:35:28.874]  Did you see that clip I sent you?
[00:35:29.995 --> 00:35:31.916]  Now, I know they're cussing on it.
[00:35:31.976 --> 00:35:35.879]  Did we cut out the cussing or do you need to cut that out?
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.381]  Yeah, cut the cop's cussing out.
[00:35:38.421 --> 00:35:39.442]  Let's do that for them.
[00:35:40.492 --> 00:35:43.693]  I'll tell you, John does the work of ten people, too, just like we do here at this office.
[00:35:44.974 --> 00:35:57.039]  And the reason I'm introing it with you get a sexual predator charge if you're caught urinating on the side of the road, even in the bushes, with nothing around but cows for miles and grasshoppers.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.122]  I've got reports here where people are being arrested for playing tag now.
[00:36:03.542 --> 00:36:05.463]  Dodgeball's been banned coast-to-coast.
[00:36:07.481 --> 00:36:08.482]  Look at this story right here.
[00:36:08.662 --> 00:36:13.085]  Model pupil ends up with criminal record for a push in the playground.
[00:36:13.506 --> 00:36:22.733]  The police were accused of invading the classroom last night after a 14-year-old schoolboy ended up with a criminal record for pushing over a boy he suspected of bullying his younger brother.
[00:36:24.354 --> 00:36:30.338]  Now, in the past, they would just give you a paddling or you'd get in trouble, or they'd say, good job, you're standing up to a bully.
[00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:31.119]  Not anymore.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:36.103]  The boy is a perfect student who is described as a model pupil...
[00:36:36.934 --> 00:36:41.435]  By his school, was given a formal reprimand by officers after an investigation.
[00:36:41.475 --> 00:36:46.117]  His name and offense have now been placed in a national police computer database.
[00:36:46.857 --> 00:36:48.638]  He is reprimanded for violent crime.
[00:36:51.118 --> 00:37:00.361]  So, this is America, where you draw a picture of your father, who's a Marine Corps captain.
[00:37:00.381 --> 00:37:01.322]  This is a real story.
[00:37:01.342 --> 00:37:02.722]  Happened two years ago.
[00:37:02.942 --> 00:37:03.822]  We interviewed the family.
[00:37:03.902 --> 00:37:06.083]  Model student again on the honor roll.
[00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:11.637]  Football team, teacher's pet, doing a great job.
[00:37:12.437 --> 00:37:15.940]  And in the art class, they said, draw a picture of somebody in your family.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.722]  Draw a picture of his father with an M16.
[00:37:19.643 --> 00:37:20.504]  Police were called.
[00:37:20.564 --> 00:37:25.768]  He was taken into, quote, protective custody to make sure the SWAT team was on standby.
[00:37:25.788 --> 00:37:31.953]  And they suspended him, I forget, I think it was like three days.
[00:37:34.215 --> 00:37:35.596]  You've all heard about the cases where
[00:37:36.647 --> 00:37:37.347]  We're good to go.
[00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:37.567]  I think?
[00:37:59.053 --> 00:38:01.735]  Security guard said, oh, what is that in your bag?
[00:38:01.895 --> 00:38:11.543]  He did the cursory search, that's freedom in America, found those and said under zero tolerance, this serrated edge butter knife, and she was arrested.
[00:38:13.061 --> 00:38:13.761]  We're good to go.
[00:38:13.781 --> 00:38:14.381]  We're good to go.
[00:38:36.429 --> 00:38:43.495]  And her mother had given her a new set of utensils, you know, the stainless steel type, and it had serrated butter knives in it.
[00:38:43.615 --> 00:38:52.922]  Cops saw it, called the police, or the security guards saw it, called them, and she was arrested and lost her... Go pull those reports up.
[00:38:52.942 --> 00:38:53.683]  You think I'm joking?
[00:38:54.223 --> 00:38:55.624]  This is America.
[00:38:57.346 --> 00:39:02.530]  This is land of the slaves, home of the cowards...
[00:39:03.687 --> 00:39:07.249]  And we do not deserve to be called land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:08.930]  We are pathetic.
[00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:12.252]  And we're going to get this country back.
[00:39:12.952 --> 00:39:21.717]  We have to set about relearning what it is to be an American and having some shame for what we've turned into.
[00:39:22.257 --> 00:39:26.219]  Jack Blood's program comes on right after mine each day from 2 to 4 p.m.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.081]  Central Time here on the Genesis Communications.
[00:39:30.194 --> 00:39:30.814]  Radio network.
[00:39:30.894 --> 00:39:32.855]  I'm looking for my report here.
[00:39:32.915 --> 00:39:33.875]  I had it in the stack.
[00:39:34.655 --> 00:39:37.635]  The report he put out that we posted on prisonplanet.com.
[00:39:38.116 --> 00:39:38.456]  Here it is.
[00:39:40.536 --> 00:39:44.957]  Internationally known radio talk show host roughed up by Austin, Texas cops.
[00:39:46.357 --> 00:39:55.359]  And on Sunday, late Saturday night, syndicated radio host Jack Blood was pepper sprayed and arrested by Austin PD.
[00:39:56.454 --> 00:39:59.435]  And we'll tell, you know, the Arab League is the comedy group.
[00:39:59.455 --> 00:40:00.495]  They're white guys.
[00:40:02.235 --> 00:40:09.217]  And, you know, they go out and jump around like Arabs and dressed up in the headdresses talking about how the government carried out 9-11.
[00:40:09.317 --> 00:40:13.037]  Why don't we have time to play a little bit of that?
[00:40:14.458 --> 00:40:17.598]  And, well, here's the man it happened to, Jack Blood.
[00:40:17.638 --> 00:40:18.638]  Jack, how are you doing today?
[00:40:18.658 --> 00:40:19.819]  I'm okay, Alex.
[00:40:19.839 --> 00:40:20.879]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[00:40:20.899 --> 00:40:21.359]  Appreciate it.
[00:40:21.972 --> 00:40:23.313]  Well, thank you for coming on.
[00:40:23.353 --> 00:40:26.354]  You know, you're lucky you're only being charged with some low-level stuff.
[00:40:26.374 --> 00:40:34.997]  If you would have been caught shoving a bully or urinating on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, you'd be charged with felonies.
[00:40:35.658 --> 00:40:51.464]  Well, I actually expected to get a lot more charges than I did, but I think that they started to feel a little humiliated about what they had done to me, at least on an administrative level, and tried to reduce it to just enough of a charge to justify arresting me and putting me through the hell that they did.
[00:40:52.498 --> 00:40:59.184]  Now, you actually went out to help somebody that suddenly, you walk out the back door, no doubt smoking cigarettes, that's why you're out there.
[00:40:59.684 --> 00:41:00.845]  You can't smoke in bars here.
[00:41:01.346 --> 00:41:04.008]  You've been hearing some local music, you walk out the back, what do you see?
[00:41:04.448 --> 00:41:07.431]  You actually can smoke at the Jackalope, which is why I go there.
[00:41:07.511 --> 00:41:08.191]  Oh, good!
[00:41:08.251 --> 00:41:12.315]  They are flying in the face of the so-called cigarette laws.
[00:41:12.375 --> 00:41:13.376]  Well, that is interesting.
[00:41:13.416 --> 00:41:16.298]  Most bars in Austin and restaurants are ignoring the law, but go ahead.
[00:41:16.318 --> 00:41:18.580]  They're really good people, and we know a lot of the people there.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.301]  In fact, the...
[00:41:20.261 --> 00:41:22.864]  The guy that was getting attacked works at the Jackalope.
[00:41:22.904 --> 00:41:33.273]  What had happened, Alex, and I got some of this after the fact, was one of the employees at the Jackalope on 6th Street saw a number of kids pissing in the alley.
[00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:34.274]  So here we go again.
[00:41:34.595 --> 00:41:39.479]  And he asked them politely to please not piss in the alley where he'd have to walk through it.
[00:41:39.939 --> 00:41:41.361]  They attacked him.
[00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:42.962]  We have a lot of children listening.
[00:41:43.162 --> 00:41:43.663]  Urinate.
[00:41:43.923 --> 00:41:44.604]  Urinate, I'm sorry.
[00:41:44.624 --> 00:41:45.484]  So again, we're back to this.
[00:41:45.564 --> 00:41:46.285]  I must be psyching.
[00:41:46.325 --> 00:41:48.486]  I brought up the stories about the cops.
[00:41:48.526 --> 00:41:49.086]  Okay, okay.
[00:41:49.346 --> 00:41:53.409]  So they were engaging in felony sex crimes in the back.
[00:41:53.469 --> 00:41:53.669]  Okay.
[00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:54.249]  Okay.
[00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.831]  And they... Hold on a second.
[00:41:57.865 --> 00:42:01.129]  And they attacked, they just, and this just attacked him for saying that.
[00:42:01.149 --> 00:42:03.111]  He threw his bike at them, and they attacked him.
[00:42:03.131 --> 00:42:16.627]  And so I'm just standing at the back of the door with some of our fans and friends in the back, and we just see this melee come down the alley, Alex, and the next thing I know, this kid who's being attacked by two Mexicans is unconscious, and they continue to beat him.
[00:42:17.788 --> 00:42:20.149]  So, really, I asked myself, what would Alex Jones do?
[00:42:20.189 --> 00:42:22.349]  Now, I mean, I really just didn't even think about it.
[00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:25.410]  I rushed into the affair to protect this kid.
[00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:26.850]  I fended off the attackers.
[00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.391]  I stood over the body.
[00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:29.511]  The kid was unconscious.
[00:42:29.531 --> 00:42:32.672]  At that point, I wasn't even sure if he was dead, Alex, to be honest with you.
[00:42:32.692 --> 00:42:33.472]  He looked so bad.
[00:42:33.792 --> 00:42:36.293]  Blood was coming out of his nose and gushing out of his nose.
[00:42:36.653 --> 00:42:37.393]  I stood over...
[00:42:37.893 --> 00:42:38.734]  We're good to go.
[00:42:55.389 --> 00:42:56.729]  But they didn't ask any questions.
[00:42:56.769 --> 00:42:58.870]  They didn't try to find out who these attackers were.
[00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.110]  They did no investigation.
[00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:03.251]  They didn't ask anyone what my role was in this whole thing.
[00:43:03.491 --> 00:43:04.892]  They just drug me off to jail.
[00:43:05.072 --> 00:43:12.994]  And the humiliation that I took while being in custody of our finest here for 12 hours was really beyond description.
[00:43:13.034 --> 00:43:15.994]  I mean, I've barely told the tip of the iceberg of the story.
[00:43:16.034 --> 00:43:16.294]  That's right.
[00:43:16.314 --> 00:43:17.235]  You've got a big cut.
[00:43:17.335 --> 00:43:17.655]  I mean...
[00:43:19.384 --> 00:43:24.128]  First, break down the physical roughing up, and then not letting you use the bathroom.
[00:43:24.488 --> 00:43:27.830]  I don't know why this is the theme today, but go over that.
[00:43:28.631 --> 00:43:30.572]  Well, look, I mean, again, here's the problem.
[00:43:30.592 --> 00:43:34.175]  I shouldn't have been arrested in the first place, but they haul me off to jail.
[00:43:34.335 --> 00:43:37.358]  And I've got to tell you, Alex, I was very indignant.
[00:43:37.418 --> 00:43:39.019]  I didn't take it lightly, okay?
[00:43:39.059 --> 00:43:39.899]  I didn't sit down.
[00:43:39.959 --> 00:43:40.980]  I wasn't a good boy.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.401]  I didn't behave myself.
[00:43:43.142 --> 00:43:45.884]  And I was immediately thrown into a cell with...
[00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:47.004]  We're good to go.
[00:43:47.084 --> 00:43:48.005]  We're good to go.
[00:44:07.993 --> 00:44:08.774]  Fire breathing.
[00:44:09.155 --> 00:44:10.977]  Okay, so King Kong jumps in there.
[00:44:11.258 --> 00:44:12.139]  They scurry off.
[00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:12.920]  What happens next?
[00:44:13.321 --> 00:44:16.886]  Okay, so as I said, I'm standing over this guy who's unconscious on the sidewalk.
[00:44:16.906 --> 00:44:20.170]  My wife is cradling his head and trying to help him.
[00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:21.713]  People are calling 911.
[00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:22.594]  Very Al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:44:23.674 --> 00:44:30.237]  There's a mob kind of gathering around, and the next thing I know, without even any identification, Alex, here's the thing.
[00:44:30.618 --> 00:44:34.859]  It's not, get down on the ground, I'm the police, you know, no warning whatsoever.
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.360]  I'm grabbed.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.082]  I probably, I think what I heard from witnesses is I turned around to face who was grabbing me.
[00:44:41.102 --> 00:44:51.587]  I was then maced directly into the eyes and blinded and violently handcuffed, so much so that I have a very deep two-inch gash on my hand just from that.
[00:44:51.667 --> 00:44:54.168]  But see, that's not safe for the police officer itself.
[00:44:54.208 --> 00:44:56.930]  They should announce themselves instead of just jumping on people.
[00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:58.211]  Well, I would think.
[00:44:58.251 --> 00:45:04.134]  And I wasn't doing anything wrong, per se, other than I was standing at the wrong place at the wrong time.
[00:45:04.174 --> 00:45:06.255]  Now, again... Okay, now they take you to jail.
[00:45:06.275 --> 00:45:09.117]  I mean, I'm sure you're saying you got the wrong guy.
[00:45:09.137 --> 00:45:13.279]  I mean, did you start explaining to the cop that, hey, you just made somebody who was innocent?
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.341]  I did, and I told them that I was with the media.
[00:45:15.461 --> 00:45:20.824]  And, of course, just like when I had my incident with TSA many years ago, they laughed in my face.
[00:45:21.474 --> 00:45:22.775]  Oh, you're not with the media.
[00:45:22.835 --> 00:45:23.816]  They didn't believe me.
[00:45:24.836 --> 00:45:30.540]  Because I'm trying to let them know that, you know, hey, look, you better treat me the best way you know how to treat someone.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.922]  Because if you don't, here I am today.
[00:45:32.982 --> 00:45:34.503]  I guess as living proof is what will happen.
[00:45:34.663 --> 00:45:35.464]  I do the opposite.
[00:45:35.684 --> 00:45:37.585]  I just shut up because I want to see what they're really going to do.
[00:45:37.926 --> 00:45:40.968]  Yeah, well, you know, at this point, I mean, I just wanted it to be over with.
[00:45:40.988 --> 00:45:41.548]  I understand.
[00:45:41.768 --> 00:45:42.389]  So I get in.
[00:45:42.629 --> 00:45:49.754]  They bring me into the facilities, the holding facilities, along with a number of other key al-Qaeda offenders.
[00:45:50.433 --> 00:45:57.897]  And I wasn't quiet, so at this point, this is the point where they took me into a back cell, where I was in a cell with four or five police who were berating me.
[00:45:58.398 --> 00:45:59.318]  Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:45:59.698 --> 00:46:12.206]  On the one hand, they're trying to take my blood pressure and trying to give me some kind of medical assistance, because I guess being maced... No, no, that's their excuse to get your blood and try to criminally charge you, hoping you're on drugs.
[00:46:12.226 --> 00:46:14.107]  Well, of course, and I didn't volunteer that.
[00:46:15.407 --> 00:46:16.048]  And because...
[00:46:16.608 --> 00:46:21.854]  Because this was not going very well, I had another incident with a police officer in the cell.
[00:46:21.874 --> 00:46:29.663]  This is when I asked if I could go to the bathroom the first time, and this is when the first officer told me that I could just go into my pants.
[00:46:30.143 --> 00:46:37.792]  But I told them, Alex, I said, look, I'm not going to go in my pants, and this will get extremely ugly if you don't let me go to the bathroom.
[00:46:38.194 --> 00:46:41.717]  At that point, they let me urinate into a drain in this cell.
[00:46:42.397 --> 00:46:53.066]  It was at that point I was strapped to a gurney and sent to Breckenridge Hospital, which I've overheard a number of nurses call Krakenridge, I guess, because of all the crack casualties that end up there.
[00:46:53.886 --> 00:46:56.608]  And I was violently, again, handcuffed to a gurney.
[00:46:56.748 --> 00:47:07.636]  The handcuffs were so tight, Alex, I couldn't feel the blood moving in my left hand, and my arm was swelling up the size of the handcuffs themselves.
[00:47:08.116 --> 00:47:17.183]  I was tied to this gurney by these handcuffs for probably four hours, again, asking multiple times, can I go to the restroom?
[00:47:17.203 --> 00:47:18.344]  Can I go to the restroom?
[00:47:18.884 --> 00:47:21.905]  Again told, ha ha ha, I can just go in my pants.
[00:47:21.945 --> 00:47:25.127]  I was finally given a bottle to use.
[00:47:25.147 --> 00:47:27.388]  That's the whole setup.
[00:47:27.448 --> 00:47:31.429]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen the reports where they tasered people to make them give samples.
[00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:32.410]  Well, and here's the thing.
[00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:37.112]  I would not allow them to keep that urine sample.
[00:47:37.492 --> 00:47:42.934]  And here's where, again, by my protesting, I wanted to physically watch them pour that down the drain.
[00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:48.975]  And by my protesting... Well, you have to, because then it'll be a violation of your Fourth Amendment, and they're known to frame people.
[00:47:49.115 --> 00:47:49.275]  Right.
[00:47:50.276 --> 00:48:06.269]  And this is when, when I made a point that I did not want them keeping my urine, this is when Officer Harvey got extremely violent with me again, right in the middle of the hospital, and nearly broke my arm to get me back into custody at the holding facilities.
[00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.793]  Now, I mean, what position were you in at that time?
[00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:15.548]  Well, I mean, I was laying down on the gurney, and he went to get me up, and I said, look, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:48:15.909 --> 00:48:20.812]  Because the doctor, who, as you read in the story... What did he do, like grab the cuffs and jerk them, or what did he do?
[00:48:20.852 --> 00:48:21.452]  Exactly.
[00:48:21.552 --> 00:48:25.234]  Jerked my wrist nearly up to my neck.
[00:48:25.274 --> 00:48:26.915]  I mean, I thought he was going to break my arm.
[00:48:26.955 --> 00:48:28.937]  Well, he can beat the rat, but he can't beat the ride.
[00:48:28.957 --> 00:48:30.738]  You just need to go ahead and sue him personally.
[00:48:31.118 --> 00:48:31.799]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[00:48:31.819 --> 00:48:34.404]  And you'll be insured to at least cost him a lot of money.
[00:48:34.464 --> 00:48:37.509]  I'm probably not going to sue, but here's the thing about Officer Harvey.
[00:48:37.709 --> 00:48:43.199]  When I told him that I might consider suing, he literally bragged about the fact that he was already being sued.
[00:48:44.761 --> 00:48:46.342]  Show him some more.
[00:48:46.422 --> 00:48:47.502]  He has a history of this.
[00:48:47.522 --> 00:48:52.385]  This guy is... I have to say, I was berating the guy for three or four hours.
[00:48:52.445 --> 00:48:55.126]  This was my revenge, is to make his life a living hell.
[00:48:55.186 --> 00:48:55.527]  That's right.
[00:48:55.567 --> 00:48:57.508]  You say in the article you wouldn't let him sleep.
[00:48:57.528 --> 00:48:59.809]  I would not allow him to sleep.
[00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:01.390]  I was telling him about 9-11.
[00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:04.071]  I was telling him about a lot of the work that we do.
[00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:05.812]  I was telling him about police violence.
[00:49:05.852 --> 00:49:13.196]  I told him that he would make a great Secret Service officer and that maybe I could help him get a job in the Secret Service.
[00:49:13.456 --> 00:49:14.316]  But, I mean, here's the thing.
[00:49:14.336 --> 00:49:18.538]  I cannot comply when I'm not being respected by my jailers.
[00:49:18.738 --> 00:49:22.519]  Whenever they respected me, I complied, and I was very calm and very nice.
[00:49:22.539 --> 00:49:33.342]  Well, look, they've standardized torture in the jails, and that's why four of the prisons around Austin in the last five years have been shut down for literally making rape videos, raping men.
[00:49:33.362 --> 00:49:39.744]  I mean, the jailers throughout history always turn into creatures far worse than their wards.
[00:49:39.964 --> 00:49:42.389]  Well, and this actually gets worse, Alex.
[00:49:42.469 --> 00:49:44.733]  It went on and on and on and on for hours.
[00:49:44.793 --> 00:49:47.739]  I mean, I have quite a story to tell here, and I don't think we probably have the time.
[00:49:47.759 --> 00:49:49.783]  Well, in the 12 hours, I mean, just hit the low points.
[00:49:49.823 --> 00:49:50.204]  What happened?
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:50:04.843]  Well, again, getting out of the hospital, having to leave my urine sample and my blood sample at the hospital, and I was again dragged off back to the holding facilities where I was left in deplorable conditions.
[00:50:04.883 --> 00:50:10.844]  The only water in these holding facilities, Alex, was a men's room bathroom sink which was full of vomit.
[00:50:11.304 --> 00:50:12.925]  That was the only place to... No, I know.
[00:50:13.485 --> 00:50:15.605]  I've been in the Austin jail down on 7th Street.
[00:50:15.625 --> 00:50:16.405]  Let me describe it.
[00:50:17.006 --> 00:50:18.966]  And I hate to be gross, but vomit...
[00:50:20.192 --> 00:50:24.275]  Mucus and feces smeared all over the walls, at least in the cells I've been in.
[00:50:26.497 --> 00:50:37.384]  I had a run-in, I guess, with this female sheriff in the holding facility who was very upset with me, Alex, for wanting to go to sleep after being awake for 24 hours.
[00:50:37.684 --> 00:50:45.329]  Threw me in a 3x3 holding, or 5x5 holding cell, as you say, covered with mucus, where I stayed for four hours.
[00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:50.653]  Austin has the next-to-the-record record, even per capita, not just per capita, total,
[00:50:51.574 --> 00:50:53.095]  Record deaths in the state of Texas.
[00:50:53.135 --> 00:50:55.297]  You're lucky they didn't hang you high in there.
[00:50:55.357 --> 00:50:55.957]  They love it.
[00:50:56.197 --> 00:50:58.439]  And they do it on almost a monthly basis.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:07.747]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.107 --> 00:51:10.049]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.409 --> 00:51:17.975]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:25.788]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.188 --> 00:51:37.616]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.936 --> 00:51:41.458]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:43.800]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.003]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.896 --> 00:52:03.936]  The war on terrorism.
[00:52:04.256 --> 00:52:07.037]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:07.317 --> 00:52:11.458]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:12.718]  So what do you do?
[00:52:13.038 --> 00:52:17.599]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:18.089 --> 00:52:20.210]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:35.396]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:42.559]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:53:01.107 --> 00:53:09.029]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:53:09.489 --> 00:53:12.670]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:16.090]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[00:53:44.602 --> 00:53:45.063]  We're good to go.
[00:54:10.223 --> 00:54:15.206]  You can go to jonesreport.com and watch the undercover video inside the car.
[00:54:15.226 --> 00:54:16.407]  The police don't know it's rolling.
[00:54:16.967 --> 00:54:22.611]  But they've got him at the back of the car, and they're talking about, oh, look, a picture of a guy with a gun and camo.
[00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:26.833]  It's his friend in the Army, in the glove compartment with a bunch of other photos of friends.
[00:54:27.794 --> 00:54:29.415]  And then she says, oh, he had a gun.
[00:54:29.455 --> 00:54:31.356]  He goes, no, if he had a gun, he'd be dead.
[00:54:32.036 --> 00:54:34.598]  And they're like, oh, too bad we can't find anything to get him.
[00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:38.112]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[00:54:38.192 --> 00:54:45.579]  I mean, you turn loose a bunch of people, you don't keep them in line, the society itself's turned into gang member land, you're going to have a problem.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.263]  And all the bullies from the union childhood folks are in the system now.
[00:54:50.343 --> 00:54:52.806]  And it's only going to get worse until we turn it around.
[00:54:53.879 --> 00:54:57.841]  Jack, why do you think then if they were going to try to charge you with a bunch of other stuff?
[00:54:57.881 --> 00:54:58.582]  I mean, you're lucky.
[00:54:59.142 --> 00:55:03.184]  I've seen video, and we put it in documentaries, where people don't even touch the cops.
[00:55:03.604 --> 00:55:09.067]  Like Oza Motley, they beat them up and then charge you with assaulting them.
[00:55:09.727 --> 00:55:12.429]  So right now, what are they charging you with?
[00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:17.370]  Public intoxication, which is a standard charge down on 6th Street.
[00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:22.691]  Everybody coming in through there gets the standard charge, and it really is pretty generic.
[00:55:22.851 --> 00:55:34.374]  I've got to tell you, the reason why I don't think they charged me with more was because of the great doctor at Breckenridge Hospital who was a fan of mine and yours, Alex, and told me and the police officer several times...
[00:55:34.694 --> 00:55:35.715]  What a big fan he was.
[00:55:35.735 --> 00:55:41.919]  And I think at that point, they started to understand that I really was with the media, and I think they kind of wanted this just to go away.
[00:55:42.579 --> 00:55:44.721]  I am, of course, going to be contesting these charges.
[00:55:44.781 --> 00:55:59.491]  And let me just say again that the hospital staff at Breckenridge was extremely helpful and professional to me, as were the ambulance drivers who were just par excellence as far as dealing with me and extremely kind, generous, and very, very professional.
[00:55:59.531 --> 00:56:00.751]  So they should be commended.
[00:56:00.992 --> 00:56:04.354]  But here's how it works, and this really, I think, is very backwards.
[00:56:04.834 --> 00:56:11.917]  It doesn't matter what kind of medical condition you have, doesn't matter what you might want to ask, such as being able to go to the bathroom, etc., etc.
[00:56:12.257 --> 00:56:16.459]  Everything has to be cleared by your jailer who sits with you in the hospital.
[00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:24.902]  So no matter what you're complaining about, what health problems you might have, they have to ask the police officer if it's okay to work with you.
[00:56:25.043 --> 00:56:26.003]  He went to medical school.
[00:56:26.463 --> 00:56:28.504]  You didn't know that all police have a medical degree?
[00:56:28.724 --> 00:56:33.967]  And thanks to one of the nurses, the policeman, his name is Officer Harvey, a.k.a.
[00:56:34.047 --> 00:56:40.050]  Roy Boy, had to loosen my handcuffs because it was, again, cutting off circulation.
[00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:43.211]  My wrist is still... Now, now, Jack, we don't know that about him.
[00:56:43.231 --> 00:56:44.092]  Well, I do.
[00:56:44.893 --> 00:56:52.864]  We do know, though, that we're going to have to investigate this story and that it's too bad that this happened to you.
[00:56:53.384 --> 00:57:02.696]  Frankly, that's why I don't really get anywhere near 6th Street anymore because it's got some good restaurants down there because I've had guys that I knew at the gym back in college
[00:57:03.417 --> 00:57:11.860]  Who no doubt I guess have a hormone imbalance and they are literally just out there starting fights.
[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:17.102]  I know big bouncers who are now cops and they just want to beat people up.
[00:57:18.442 --> 00:57:19.543]  Well, let me say this.
[00:57:19.763 --> 00:57:22.785]  One of my listeners wrote me and made a good point.
[00:57:22.825 --> 00:57:29.028]  He said that they put all of these Nazi cops, the worst cops possible, down on 6th Street to deal with what goes on down there.
[00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:34.612]  And I sympathize with him because I know some of the nonsense that happens down on 6th Street.
[00:57:34.652 --> 00:57:36.353]  But, I mean, here you have this magnet.
[00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:41.798]  All of these bars and clubs down there, it draws everybody down, as you know, Alex, into Austin, Texas.
[00:57:42.138 --> 00:57:51.467]  And then again, if you find yourself, like I did, trying to defend somebody who was helpless on the ground and you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, I mean, you just suffer along with everybody else.
[00:57:51.487 --> 00:57:58.934]  Well, that's really the shame here is you did the good Samaritan thing, but it's the old African saying, no good deed will go unpunished.
[00:57:59.995 --> 00:58:01.757]  But the key here is that
[00:58:02.774 --> 00:58:08.800]  I don't know what happened to 6th Street, because I think the bad cops have driven folks out, or maybe the gang members have.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:11.162]  10, 15 years ago, 6th Street had a lot of nice people.
[00:58:11.202 --> 00:58:11.842]  It was fun.
[00:58:12.303 --> 00:58:17.027]  Now, I go down there, and a lot of it's just thugs everywhere, so it's a mess.
[00:58:17.347 --> 00:58:20.891]  Well, I want to thank the people at the Jackalope down there, who were also very helpful.
[00:58:20.911 --> 00:58:25.415]  We have a lot of witnesses to this, Alex, including the young man who was attacked and beat up.
[00:58:25.715 --> 00:58:27.977]  He had a broken nose and several injuries himself.
[00:58:27.997 --> 00:58:29.138]  Are you going to interview him today on your show?
[00:58:29.738 --> 00:58:31.018]  I don't know if I'll have him on today.
[00:58:31.058 --> 00:58:33.219]  I have a core appearance on Wednesday.
[00:58:33.239 --> 00:58:36.000]  I'm going to see how this goes, and then we'll figure out how to proceed from there.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:36.620]  Okay.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.880]  Well, we're glad you got out in one piece, Jack.
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.280]  Thank you very much for having me on, Alex.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.300]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.961 --> 00:59:00.021]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:01.842]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.502 --> 00:59:03.323]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.063 --> 00:59:04.963]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.983 --> 00:59:09.305]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.805 --> 00:59:13.927]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:22.791]  He was out scouting for movie locations.
[00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:26.433]  This is years before the Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:59:30.007 --> 00:59:34.010]  And got video of someone who is Timothy McVeigh.
[00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.990]  They've done voice print.
[00:59:36.071 --> 00:59:39.873]  They've had specialists look at the nose, the teeth.
[00:59:40.413 --> 00:59:41.694]  They've got comparisons here.
[00:59:42.475 --> 00:59:47.258]  It is a huge report that is out in all places, Hustler Magazine.
[00:59:49.199 --> 00:59:52.181]  And they really started decades ago with the JFK.
[00:59:52.361 --> 00:59:53.661]  They've talked about 9-11.
[00:59:54.082 --> 00:59:57.724]  So Larry Flint certainly knows what sells.
[00:59:58.719 --> 01:00:03.523]  And this report meshes with the intel we have that McVeigh never really left the military.
[01:00:05.005 --> 01:00:13.072]  But we'll get Mr. Bean to tell his story, Bill Bean, and then we'll bring in the other pieces of the puzzle that we have.
[01:00:14.593 --> 01:00:26.043]  We also have photos of a rider truck being loaded with what looks like fuel oil at Camp Gruber in Oklahoma right before the attacks.
[01:00:27.133 --> 01:00:29.656]  So we've got a big report coming out tonight on this.
[01:00:31.678 --> 01:00:34.000]  Thank you so much for coming on with us today, Mr. Bean.
[01:00:35.242 --> 01:00:36.623]  Alex, it's good to be on your show.
[01:00:37.464 --> 01:00:37.824]  You bet.
[01:00:37.904 --> 01:00:49.757]  I think the best way to do this is tell us about yourself, tell us who you are, tell us where you were, and then how you woke up to the footage you had and the incredible harassment and intimidation you've gone through since you got this footage.
[01:00:50.505 --> 01:00:50.865]  Sure.
[01:00:51.546 --> 01:00:53.768]  I started as a local actor in Chicago.
[01:00:53.788 --> 01:00:59.151]  I took screenwriting classes and wrote a number of screenplays.
[01:01:00.112 --> 01:01:04.135]  I formed a small group of people that were interested in making a film.
[01:01:04.155 --> 01:01:12.601]  I formed a production company and I went out to the Dakotas to look for locations for some of the scenes.
[01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:16.344]  I contacted the North Dakota Film Office
[01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:23.174]  And they directed me to a small military base called Camp Grafton.
[01:01:23.894 --> 01:01:31.399]  I'd never heard of it, and I actually wasn't that interested in going to see it, but they said, it's right on your way to the other locations.
[01:01:32.179 --> 01:01:33.720]  You'd probably have a good time seeing it.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:34.621]  So I went over there.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.024]  And for those that don't know, in filmmaking, a big part of it is scouting locations.
[01:01:40.424 --> 01:01:48.190]  And then every county, every city, or most counties and cities, but all states, have special offices trying to get films made in their state.
[01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:49.972]  It's very competitive, so they were there helping you.
[01:01:50.512 --> 01:01:50.713]  Right.
[01:01:50.733 --> 01:01:52.354]  That was the North Dakota Film Office.
[01:01:52.474 --> 01:01:52.854]  Yes.
[01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:56.898]  And they were a great help to me and directed me over to Camp Grafton.
[01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:03.399]  I went to Camp Grafton and met the superintendent, a man by the name of Colonel Dahl.
[01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.720]  I videotaped myself talking to him.
[01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:11.385]  And he said that I was there that day to scout locations for film.
[01:02:12.966 --> 01:02:19.531]  I then took a tour of the base and basically videotaped everywhere I went.
[01:02:20.192 --> 01:02:25.536]  And the upshot of that was about an hour or so into the tour,
[01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.451]  I saw two guys parking a tank.
[01:02:29.511 --> 01:02:36.296]  So I forget whether I just walked away from the tour or whether I asked if I could go inside the tank.
[01:02:36.536 --> 01:02:47.024]  But anyway, once the tank was parked, I went over with my video camera running and it had a kind of a porthole entrance in the rear of the tank.
[01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:48.465]  That's how you entered and exited.
[01:02:49.305 --> 01:02:53.008]  I crouched in the entrance with my video camera running and
[01:02:53.721 --> 01:02:57.785]  And the driver of the vehicle was closing a front hatch.
[01:02:58.545 --> 01:03:06.212]  He turned around, not knowing that I was there, and basically froze and looked at me and was not too happy to be on film.
[01:03:06.232 --> 01:03:09.155]  He attempted to push past me.
[01:03:11.577 --> 01:03:14.920]  I attempted to ask him a few questions, as I had everybody else.
[01:03:15.861 --> 01:03:19.544]  Everybody else had been very polite to me, very nice and...
[01:03:20.638 --> 01:03:21.639]  This is unbelievable, folks.
[01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:24.320]  Wait until you hear the details with our guest, Bill Bean.
[01:03:24.341 --> 01:03:26.322]  On the other side, we have them red-handed.
[01:03:56.397 --> 01:03:59.560]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.841]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.222 --> 01:04:09.888]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.548 --> 01:04:17.614]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.014 --> 01:04:20.957]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.297 --> 01:04:23.659]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.079 --> 01:04:24.920]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.382 --> 01:04:26.163]  We're good to go.
[01:04:26.183 --> 01:04:26.903]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.993 --> 01:04:54.953]  Good morning, honey.
[01:04:55.313 --> 01:05:01.295]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[01:05:01.595 --> 01:05:02.195]  Yeah.
[01:05:02.595 --> 01:05:04.016]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[01:05:04.356 --> 01:05:07.777]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel perky system.
[01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:09.737]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[01:05:10.178 --> 01:05:11.898]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[01:05:12.258 --> 01:05:14.039]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[01:05:14.259 --> 01:05:15.099]  Honey, cheer up.
[01:05:15.519 --> 01:05:17.781]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:05:18.041 --> 01:05:18.341]  What?
[01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:29.270]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:34.394]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[01:05:34.714 --> 01:05:35.894]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[01:05:35.995 --> 01:05:38.575]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209, or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.
[01:05:38.615 --> 01:05:38.835]  Call 888-803-4438.
[01:05:38.855 --> 01:05:39.056]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:05:40.476 --> 01:05:41.736]  Travel Berkey, not available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:59.882]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:06:00.302 --> 01:06:05.063]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:06:05.443 --> 01:06:08.064]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:11.965]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:06:12.746 --> 01:06:17.067]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:20.688]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:06:21.288 --> 01:06:24.129]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:06:24.907 --> 01:06:27.048]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:06:27.088 --> 01:06:28.849]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:06:28.869 --> 01:06:28.969]  U.S.
[01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:31.290]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:31.610]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:32.490]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:33.171]  Ask for George.
[01:06:54.463 --> 01:07:00.485]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.085 --> 01:07:04.126]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.686 --> 01:07:07.547]  Very important interview today.
[01:07:08.547 --> 01:07:10.007]  Another one coming up in the next hour.
[01:07:10.147 --> 01:07:12.488]  Top professor, written U.S.
[01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:17.849]  Biological Weapons Treaties, going public saying clearly the anthrax attacks are an inside job.
[01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:20.070]  Remember those of 2001?
[01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:22.931]  He'll be joining us coming up in 51 and a half minutes.
[01:07:24.606 --> 01:07:33.130]  Right now, we are joined by Bill Bean, filmmaker out there in the Dakotas, scouting film locations with the film office of the state.
[01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:34.890]  He was directed out to a military base.
[01:07:36.211 --> 01:07:39.712]  He got authorization from the Colonel Dahl to tape.
[01:07:39.772 --> 01:07:51.557]  Everybody was very friendly, but then he goes up to the back of a portal to a large armored vehicle and starts videotaping the person as upset, trying to be furtive, trying to basically cover their face.
[01:07:52.478 --> 01:07:58.741]  And you look at stills of McVeigh, with stills of him in prison, it is McVeigh.
[01:07:59.161 --> 01:08:02.682]  And now there's been voice print, face print, face studies have been done.
[01:08:03.463 --> 01:08:04.723]  And this is key.
[01:08:04.763 --> 01:08:06.704]  This is a year after he was out of the military.
[01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:07.725]  Okay?
[01:08:08.325 --> 01:08:10.006]  A year after he was even out of the reserves.
[01:08:10.026 --> 01:08:11.006]  We're going to go over all that.
[01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:13.287]  But for stations that just joined us, Bill...
[01:08:14.139 --> 01:08:22.364]  Let's recap and start with a story that everything you went through... I mean, even before you knew what footage you had, all these weird things were happening.
[01:08:22.404 --> 01:08:23.064]  Now you know.
[01:08:23.084 --> 01:08:28.487]  And then I want to go into who McVeigh really was, all of our research, what really happened in OKC.
[01:08:28.867 --> 01:08:30.228]  We'll do that by the end of the hour.
[01:08:30.248 --> 01:08:31.189]  We're not going to take any calls.
[01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:32.069]  Sorry, folks.
[01:08:32.409 --> 01:08:33.070]  This is so important.
[01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:34.330]  I want to give them all the time we've got.
[01:08:34.871 --> 01:08:36.572]  Bill, recap, okay?
[01:08:36.592 --> 01:08:38.773]  For those that just joined us, recap and then continue.
[01:08:39.702 --> 01:08:40.463]  Okay, sure.
[01:08:40.563 --> 01:08:45.449]  So I had written a screenplay and contacted the North Dakota Film Office.
[01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:54.300]  They directed me over to the military training base where they teach explosives and demolition.
[01:08:55.181 --> 01:08:55.862]  And the...
[01:08:58.112 --> 01:09:01.915]  The base commander, superintendent, Colonel Dahl, met me.
[01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:03.336]  I videotaped him.
[01:09:03.816 --> 01:09:04.616]  He was very nice.
[01:09:04.757 --> 01:09:09.380]  He turned me over to the billeting director, who actually took me on the tour.
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:12.982]  The tour lasted two and a half, three hours.
[01:09:13.362 --> 01:09:17.025]  Everywhere I went on the base, I videotaped what I was looking at.
[01:09:17.465 --> 01:09:21.748]  Even if I didn't have a scene written, I thought, well, I can look at this and maybe write a scene later.
[01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:24.930]  Everybody I spoke to was very polite to me.
[01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:26.431]  They answered all my questions.
[01:09:27.012 --> 01:09:28.052]  I had a very nice time.
[01:09:28.773 --> 01:09:33.395]  Then I saw two soldiers parking an armored personnel carrier.
[01:09:34.096 --> 01:09:42.160]  I walked away from the billeting director, and I entered the rear of the armored personnel carrier.
[01:09:42.721 --> 01:09:50.025]  I crouched in the doorway, and when the soldier who was parking it turned around and looked at me, he basically froze.
[01:09:51.122 --> 01:09:55.505]  And attempted basically right away just to push past me through the portal.
[01:09:56.005 --> 01:09:56.885]  But I was right there.
[01:09:56.905 --> 01:09:59.126]  I was blocking the area, so he couldn't do that.
[01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:01.688]  And I attempted to ask him.
[01:10:01.728 --> 01:10:03.689]  I said, oh, you know, what's your job?
[01:10:03.749 --> 01:10:04.629]  And he said, what's that?
[01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.990]  I said, what's your job?
[01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:07.371]  He says, I'm just a parts clerk.
[01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:11.933]  Well, I thought that was kind of a flippant answer at the time, and I didn't appreciate that.
[01:10:12.034 --> 01:10:15.696]  But I said to him, oh, you're just kind of parking this one?
[01:10:15.736 --> 01:10:16.416]  And he says, yeah.
[01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:22.340]  And I was actually going to ask him a few more questions, but I thought, well, what do I know?
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.941]  You know, maybe he's got some sergeant yelling at him or something.
[01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:27.761]  So basically I moved and I let him go by.
[01:10:29.422 --> 01:10:37.243]  So that's how I got the footage originally, and that was on August 3, 1993, at Camp Grafton, North Dakota.
[01:10:38.944 --> 01:10:45.585]  And I finished the tour, went to various other locations on the base,
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:58.166]  I was treated very well by everybody there, and then I left, and I never was at Camp Grafton again, so you can't say that it was some other day he was there or some other time.
[01:10:58.766 --> 01:11:01.888]  That was the only day in my life that I'd ever been to Camp Grafton.
[01:11:03.828 --> 01:11:05.049]  Now, that was August of 93.
[01:11:05.169 --> 01:11:07.850]  About a year later, I started to get...
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960]  Hang-up phone calls.
[01:11:13.361 --> 01:11:17.762]  And at first, it didn't really mean much to me, other than it was annoying.
[01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:21.864]  I thought, well, maybe somebody just got a number that's similar to mine or something like that.
[01:11:23.225 --> 01:11:33.048]  But then the hang-up phone calls started to have a pattern to them, wherein I'd get up in the morning and there'd be a hang-up phone call, but nobody'd be there.
[01:11:33.729 --> 01:11:38.291]  I'd walk into the bathroom, there'd be a hang-up phone call, nobody'd be there.
[01:11:38.931 --> 01:11:39.331]  I'd say...
[01:11:39.775 --> 01:11:41.837]  Who the heck has given us these hang-up phone calls?
[01:11:42.057 --> 01:11:43.278]  There'd be a hang-up phone call.
[01:11:43.558 --> 01:11:44.319]  Nobody would be there.
[01:11:45.319 --> 01:11:46.100]  This went on.
[01:11:46.641 --> 01:11:50.384]  Eventually, it went on for 10 years, and I'm not exaggerating this at all.
[01:11:52.185 --> 01:11:56.849]  It progressed from mere hang-up phone calls to people.
[01:11:56.869 --> 01:12:01.332]  I would have somebody in my house, and I'd be speaking to them directly.
[01:12:01.432 --> 01:12:03.634]  Maybe we'd have just a normal conversation.
[01:12:03.914 --> 01:12:05.756]  Who's better, the Cubs or the White Sox?
[01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:10.072]  And then the phone would ring, and somebody would say, well, the White Sox are better.
[01:12:10.232 --> 01:12:11.493]  And then they'd laugh and hang up.
[01:12:12.174 --> 01:12:15.777]  So I was allowed to know that I was under surveillance.
[01:12:17.479 --> 01:12:20.362]  Now, you know how you were under surveillance.
[01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:23.205]  99% chance they were using the phone itself.
[01:12:23.265 --> 01:12:25.747]  They dial in on regular landlines.
[01:12:25.767 --> 01:12:27.149]  Now everybody knows about cell phones.
[01:12:28.047 --> 01:12:33.470]  And they use a receiver itself, so if that's happening to you, unplug the phone from the wall.
[01:12:35.332 --> 01:12:37.013]  I would do that today in an instant.
[01:12:37.573 --> 01:12:39.114]  I wish I knew that then, yeah.
[01:12:39.854 --> 01:12:54.503]  And then it progressed from that to I could be at somebody else's house or somebody else's apartment, and if I brought up the subject of hang-up phone calls, they would then get a hang-up phone call on their phone.
[01:12:55.324 --> 01:12:56.785]  Now, you were under heavy surveillance.
[01:12:57.933 --> 01:13:06.430]  Well, you know, I don't know who did it, and I don't know exactly how they did it, but I was allowed to know that not only was my phone tapped...
[01:13:07.193 --> 01:13:09.574]  But my emails were intercepted.
[01:13:09.974 --> 01:13:12.115]  My credit card purchases were monitored.
[01:13:13.435 --> 01:13:22.999]  And, of course, this happens so often, you probably never would have put two and two together with the footage you had from ten years before if they hadn't have done this harassment.
[01:13:23.019 --> 01:13:25.960]  But they were trying to flesh you out, see what you were doing.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.922]  And, again, this guy never identified himself as Tim McVeigh.
[01:13:31.942 --> 01:13:33.642]  He just says, I'm just a parts clerk.
[01:13:34.583 --> 01:13:34.723]  And...
[01:13:35.854 --> 01:13:36.614]  That was in 93.
[01:13:36.694 --> 01:13:51.703]  Then in 96, in January of 96, I made the acquaintance of a man and his wife, and it later was revealed to me that they had gone into a bookstore.
[01:13:51.803 --> 01:14:03.589]  I used to go to a bookstore every Saturday, and it was later told to me that what they had done is they had gone into the bookstore every Saturday for a month and just sat there and watched me.
[01:14:04.289 --> 01:14:05.370]  I didn't know this at the time.
[01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:07.352]  Then they asked someone to introduce us.
[01:14:08.393 --> 01:14:15.759]  And the person who worked at the bookstore said to me, look, there's a couple here, they want to meet you.
[01:14:15.879 --> 01:14:17.160]  And I said, they want to meet me?
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:20.123]  And she says, no, wait a minute, what I mean is I want you to meet them.
[01:14:20.143 --> 01:14:22.285]  And I said, okay, why?
[01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:24.747]  And she goes, oh, I don't know, just talk to them, will you?
[01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:26.729]  So I said, well, okay, you know.
[01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:31.413]  So anyway, I got to know this couple, very pleasant, very nice people.
[01:14:32.373 --> 01:14:41.557]  And after I had known them for a couple of months, it turned out that he was a retired military intelligence officer from Fort Huachuca, Arizona.
[01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:46.019]  And Fort Huachuca, I believe, is where they have signal intercept.
[01:14:46.139 --> 01:14:53.202]  So that's a place where, like the NSA, where they listen to phone calls and they monitor...
[01:14:55.359 --> 01:15:03.403]  But I will tell you, harassment would probably be done from a sub-office under the name of a private corporation with a U.S.
[01:15:03.423 --> 01:15:08.166]  government agent over it with private contractors just from past things we witnessed.
[01:15:09.846 --> 01:15:10.226]  Yes.
[01:15:11.287 --> 01:15:14.408]  When I got the hang-up phone calls, then I learned to do Star 69.
[01:15:15.771 --> 01:15:19.875]  And I learned to record what happened when I dialed star 69.
[01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:21.596]  And this was interesting, too.
[01:15:21.656 --> 01:15:23.458]  And by the way, you did record those, yes.
[01:15:23.478 --> 01:15:23.898]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:24.218 --> 01:15:24.538]  Sure.
[01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:26.200]  And you've given those to the press now.
[01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:28.702]  Please continue.
[01:15:29.082 --> 01:15:29.423]  Sure.
[01:15:30.764 --> 01:15:42.774]  For instance, I'd get a hang-up phone call, and then I'd put the record on, and I'd dial star 69, and then an operator would come on and say, the number of your last incoming call was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:42.854 --> 01:15:43.775]  And then they'd say...
[01:15:44.861 --> 01:15:46.782]  Punch one now to call that number back.
[01:15:46.863 --> 01:15:55.789]  So then I would punch the number back, and then another operator would come on and say, the number you just dialed, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, does not exist.
[01:15:56.169 --> 01:15:58.671]  Well, it's the same number that the other operator just gave me.
[01:15:59.712 --> 01:16:04.395]  Or I would get a hang-up phone call, and same thing.
[01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.316]  I'd record it then.
[01:16:05.356 --> 01:16:10.680]  I'd punch star 69, and then I'd get a number, and then they'd say, punch one now to dial that number.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.142]  I'd dial that number, and it'd be a security room somewhere.
[01:16:13.829 --> 01:16:16.331]  And then somebody would say to me, how did you get this number?
[01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:18.752]  And I'd say, look, I just dialed star 69.
[01:16:19.212 --> 01:16:22.535]  And they said, well, there's nobody here but me, and I didn't call you.
[01:16:22.655 --> 01:16:24.476]  And I said, well, I didn't call you.
[01:16:24.996 --> 01:16:27.798]  Anyway, yeah, I have a bunch of this stuff on tape.
[01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:35.250]  You can consider it humorous or frightening or various different ways to look at it.
[01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:37.751]  Now, you've given us still photos, the video.
[01:16:38.912 --> 01:16:41.453]  It's, again, a national news story right now on Hustler.
[01:16:41.473 --> 01:16:44.414]  And before you laugh, folks, they do serious reports.
[01:16:44.454 --> 01:16:45.955]  They broke a lot of JFK stuff.
[01:16:46.295 --> 01:16:48.776]  They've done other government-sponsored terror stuff in the past.
[01:16:49.466 --> 01:17:00.608]  And so they do do these reports, and of course I'm sure... I want to get into how you finally got in contact with the media and how this has now come out, but please continue with what then happened next.
[01:17:01.568 --> 01:17:19.112]  Yeah, then it progressed to... I would have a private conversation in my house or somebody else's house or whatever, and then maybe the next day I'd be sitting down at a restaurant, and five, eight minutes after I'm sitting there, two guys would come in and they'd sit on either side of me
[01:17:19.744 --> 01:17:25.605]  And then they basically have the same conversation with each other that I had with somebody in private the night before.
[01:17:26.645 --> 01:17:31.366]  And, like, for the first five times that this happened, I thought, well, that's a coincidence.
[01:17:31.406 --> 01:17:33.567]  That's just what I was talking about last night.
[01:17:34.807 --> 01:17:40.368]  And you have to remember, before you think I'm really stupid, I didn't know that this was Tim McVeigh on the tape.
[01:17:40.788 --> 01:17:43.049]  But let me tell you why they probably did this.
[01:17:43.069 --> 01:17:48.810]  And the reason I know this is I've studied past harassment cases, past declassified operations.
[01:17:49.692 --> 01:17:53.172]  At first it was to watch you and monitor you to find out if you knew what you had.
[01:17:53.889 --> 01:18:08.452]  Then they decided, in case you ever found out about it, to do all this so it would sound so ridiculous, so you would add all this now to the story you're telling with the video to cloud any discussion of the video and make it sound like you're nuts instead of looking at the video.
[01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:20.574]  A lot of COINTELPRO operations are meant to, in black ops, to have everything so weird and so convoluted, it's called a smoke screen, that people can't get through to the original information.
[01:18:20.594 --> 01:18:21.634]  Do you get what I'm saying?
[01:18:22.094 --> 01:18:23.055]  Sure, exactly.
[01:18:23.236 --> 01:18:38.574]  And in fact, when I met that retired military intelligence officer, out of the blue he would ask me questions like, do you know the difference between a military investigation and a civilian one?
[01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:42.969]  And I had no idea what he was talking about, and I'd say, well, no, I don't know.
[01:18:43.009 --> 01:18:43.730]  What's the difference?
[01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:47.153]  And he'd say, there's no limit to what the military can do.
[01:18:47.294 --> 01:18:48.855]  Yeah, it's what we see today.
[01:18:48.875 --> 01:18:50.597]  Secret arrest, secret torture.
[01:18:50.657 --> 01:18:51.558]  It's all reporters.
[01:18:51.578 --> 01:18:52.619]  Stay there.
[01:18:55.722 --> 01:18:57.945]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:05.239]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:19:05.459 --> 01:19:08.201]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:09.341]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:19:10.702 --> 01:19:15.305]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:19:16.205 --> 01:19:23.470]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:27.532]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:19:29.685 --> 01:19:33.126]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:19:34.106 --> 01:19:35.386]  Call for your copy today.
[01:19:35.626 --> 01:19:37.847]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:44.728]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:19:45.449 --> 01:19:45.849]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:45.869 --> 01:19:46.089]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.211 --> 01:19:53.912]  Hello, folks.
[01:19:53.952 --> 01:20:00.778]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[01:20:01.038 --> 01:20:08.164]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:20:08.284 --> 01:20:19.814]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:20:20.114 --> 01:20:20.915]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.159 --> 01:21:00.122]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:21:01.362 --> 01:21:05.424]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:21:06.145 --> 01:21:13.168]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain and Western Europe.
[01:21:14.071 --> 01:21:22.838]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[01:21:23.498 --> 01:21:28.562]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:29.583]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:29.603 --> 01:21:29.883]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:41.408 --> 01:21:42.369]  Just call today.
[01:21:42.489 --> 01:21:45.511]  Our operators are standing by to take your subscription.
[01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:46.832]  It's absolutely free.
[01:21:53.889 --> 01:21:55.550]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:56.431]  What's wrong?
[01:21:56.451 --> 01:21:57.732]  I am so tired.
[01:21:57.792 --> 01:22:00.273]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[01:22:00.393 --> 01:22:01.474]  I have tried everything.
[01:22:01.554 --> 01:22:03.295]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[01:22:03.455 --> 01:22:04.596]  You name it, I've tried it.
[01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:07.018]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[01:22:07.178 --> 01:22:08.739]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[01:22:08.979 --> 01:22:11.041]  Then we discovered something that really helps.
[01:22:11.141 --> 01:22:13.362]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:13.542 --> 01:22:14.083]  The what?
[01:22:14.343 --> 01:22:16.404]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[01:22:16.544 --> 01:22:21.828]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:25.310]  How well are you sleeping?
[01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:27.172]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?

[01:22:53.476 --> 01:23:19.870]  Big John, Big John Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive He stood six foot six and weighed 245 Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John Big John, Big John, Big Bad John
[01:23:21.249 --> 01:23:23.311]  Big John.
[01:23:24.452 --> 01:23:27.074]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[01:23:27.114 --> 01:23:29.896]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[01:23:30.276 --> 01:23:34.239]  Didn't say much, kind of quiet and shy, but he spoke it all.
[01:23:34.279 --> 01:23:36.241]  He just said hi to Big John.
[01:23:38.342 --> 01:23:49.291]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right-hand-send Louisiana fella to the promised land.
[01:23:49.311 --> 01:23:50.052]  Big John.
[01:23:51.238 --> 01:23:51.818]  Welcome back.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.181]  Glad that you joined us.
[01:23:58.022 --> 01:24:00.723]  And I'm really thankful for Bill Bean's courage.
[01:24:02.364 --> 01:24:07.307]  Again, he was at a military base in 93, Camp Grafton in the Dakotas.
[01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:16.672]  He's out there on a scouting mission looking for places to shoot a film, one of the keys to making a film, one of the preliminaries.
[01:24:17.911 --> 01:24:22.695]  And everybody's friendly, but he goes up to the back of an armored vehicle, and there's what looks like McVeigh.
[01:24:22.735 --> 01:24:23.916]  And boy, I mean, this is McVeigh.
[01:24:23.936 --> 01:24:24.516]  You've got to see it.
[01:24:25.217 --> 01:24:32.422]  The photos and video are going up on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com right now, thanks to him sending it to us.
[01:24:32.743 --> 01:24:39.348]  And he goes up to the back of the vehicle, and this guy is upset that he's videotaping, tries to get past him.
[01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:41.243]  But he doesn't know what he has.
[01:24:41.343 --> 01:24:48.092]  And then from 1993 until 2003, the next ten years, phone calls, harassment, classic.
[01:24:48.112 --> 01:24:50.255]  This is all textbook stuff.
[01:24:51.198 --> 01:24:51.758]  We're good to go.
[01:24:51.778 --> 01:24:52.178]  We're good to go.
[01:25:13.969 --> 01:25:16.870]  And it's a cover story in this month's Hustler Magazine.
[01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.611]  Before you laugh, folks, they do a lot of really serious reports in there in the past.
[01:25:20.811 --> 01:25:26.273]  They've broken a lot of national news stories, especially about Republican pervert behavior.
[01:25:27.714 --> 01:25:36.717]  Going back to our guest, so when did you start thinking it was connected to the footage you'd shot that you'd probably forgotten about?
[01:25:37.954 --> 01:25:38.675]  Right.
[01:25:38.775 --> 01:25:45.361]  Yeah, this harassment, bizarre incidences in my life just became the norm after a while.
[01:25:46.022 --> 01:25:47.703]  And I really didn't know what to think of it.
[01:25:48.484 --> 01:25:51.647]  It did seem to me that something was up because it was so odd.
[01:25:52.828 --> 01:26:03.318]  And then, I believe it was in 1997 or 98, I took my footage over to a friend of mine who knew about my project, my film project.
[01:26:04.128 --> 01:26:07.071]  And I said, oh, let me show you some new stuff I got.
[01:26:07.131 --> 01:26:10.193]  So I popped the tape in, and it starts to play.
[01:26:10.854 --> 01:26:15.578]  And I walked out of the room, and he says, wait a minute, this guy in the tank, he says...
[01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:18.055]  When did you shoot this?
[01:26:18.115 --> 01:26:19.215]  And I said, oh, forget that.
[01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:23.678]  I said, that's just some jerk I photographed at a base, and he wouldn't even talk to me.
[01:26:23.958 --> 01:26:25.339]  He says, no, no, no, go back to that.
[01:26:25.439 --> 01:26:29.001]  So I went back, and he says, freeze it when he turns around.
[01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:30.122]  And I said, yeah.
[01:26:30.162 --> 01:26:31.823]  I said, that's about all I got from him.
[01:26:31.843 --> 01:26:35.765]  He just sort of stared at me, mumbled some nonsense, and then pushed past me.
[01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:37.426]  And he says, don't you know who that is?
[01:26:37.466 --> 01:26:39.827]  And I go, no, that's just the jerk in the tank.
[01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:40.728]  And he goes, no.
[01:26:40.768 --> 01:26:42.929]  He says, I've been watching the trial all day on TV.
[01:26:42.969 --> 01:26:44.290]  He says, that's Tim McVeigh.
[01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:46.271]  That's the guy who blew up the Murrow Federal Building.
[01:26:47.074 --> 01:26:49.095]  And I said, well, are you sure?
[01:26:49.115 --> 01:26:50.755]  He says, look at it yourself.
[01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:56.817]  So I, you know, of course, played it and played it and looked at it again and looked at pictures of McVeigh.
[01:26:57.437 --> 01:26:59.038]  When did the light bulb go off?
[01:27:00.158 --> 01:27:14.202]  Well, the light bulb didn't go off again for another year or two because McVeigh had been in the military and I just assumed we were ships that passed in the night and that this was his military assignment or whatever.
[01:27:14.242 --> 01:27:16.603]  It didn't occur to me that he was secretly there.
[01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:20.973]  So it didn't really start to dawn on me until 1999 or 2000.
[01:27:21.673 --> 01:27:42.327]  And at that time, I looked on the Internet and I saw that his military record said nothing about Camp Grafton and that his military involvement in the regular Army and in the Army Reserve ended a year and a half before I took the tape of him in August 1993.
[01:27:44.085 --> 01:27:47.687]  And at that time I thought, well, they must have incorrect here.
[01:27:48.047 --> 01:27:52.108]  This is incorrect information because I videotaped them in August of 93.
[01:27:53.049 --> 01:28:01.512]  And then it began to slowly dawn on me that there might be more involved here than anything I had dreamed of before.
[01:28:01.652 --> 01:28:02.673]  Did you get scared?
[01:28:04.313 --> 01:28:06.214]  You know, I have to tell you, I didn't get scared.
[01:28:06.234 --> 01:28:12.957]  I had put up with so much crap for so many years that I just got really angry.
[01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:14.620]  I just got really angry.
[01:28:16.081 --> 01:28:26.951]  I would have people come up to me on the street and ask me directions, and then when I turned around to give them directions, they'd start screaming, don't touch me, leave me alone, help.
[01:28:27.691 --> 01:28:31.375]  And I couldn't figure out any of this nonsense that was going on.
[01:28:32.075 --> 01:28:36.879]  They were trying to get it on record somehow to make it look like you're insane.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.063]  See, you're meant to tell all this instead of talking about the tape.
[01:28:43.647 --> 01:28:44.529]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:46.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.576 --> 01:28:50.262]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.529 --> 01:28:59.652]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.892 --> 01:29:01.653]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.914 --> 01:29:08.198]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:08.498 --> 01:29:14.622]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.863 --> 01:29:20.887]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.187 --> 01:29:27.591]  With no side effects, the 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:27.731 --> 01:29:31.253]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:31.573 --> 01:29:35.276]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:35.456 --> 01:29:38.017]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:38.137 --> 01:29:39.198]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:39.318 --> 01:29:39.918]  We're good to go.
[01:29:39.938 --> 01:29:40.078]  I think?
[01:29:56.485 --> 01:30:01.407]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:06.008]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.308 --> 01:30:15.231]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.431 --> 01:30:19.072]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.352 --> 01:30:24.354]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.654 --> 01:30:31.400]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:32.541]  What about you?
[01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:38.546]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:55.912]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:56.172 --> 01:30:58.193]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:58.353 --> 01:31:05.457]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:31:05.678 --> 01:31:14.243]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[01:31:14.583 --> 01:31:19.249]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[01:31:19.409 --> 01:31:23.434]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[01:31:23.634 --> 01:31:26.097]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[01:31:26.257 --> 01:31:30.602]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:34.006 --> 01:31:34.506]  We're good to go.
[01:32:23.958 --> 01:32:26.019]  I want to give some credit where credit is due.
[01:32:27.719 --> 01:32:32.881]  Our guest has been trying to finally figure this out, been trying to get this story out for a while without success.
[01:32:32.941 --> 01:32:34.061]  I wish we would have run into him.
[01:32:35.218 --> 01:32:47.122]  But the editor over there at Hustler, the investigative journalist that did a lot of the reporting on this, Brian Sachs, just amazing.
[01:32:47.142 --> 01:32:49.963]  We're going to go back to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:32:50.003 --> 01:32:53.045]  And again, he graciously sent us the video, stills of it.
[01:32:55.425 --> 01:33:02.368]  The reporters over there at the magazine contacted us to give us this information because they're listeners and because they're doing a
[01:33:03.058 --> 01:33:03.718]  We're good to go.
[01:33:32.469 --> 01:33:35.530]  In the same issue, there's articles about the Bushes and the Nazis.
[01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:38.151]  I mean, I just can't believe this is in the mainstream news.
[01:33:38.892 --> 01:33:41.393]  But again, you don't see CNN or Fox reporting on it.
[01:33:42.413 --> 01:33:44.274]  It's Larry Flint doing it.
[01:33:45.915 --> 01:33:48.876]  But if we don't expose government-sponsored terror, we're not going to have a country.
[01:33:50.737 --> 01:33:56.299]  The main person I want to commend is Bill Bean for having the courage to go public.
[01:33:57.553 --> 01:33:59.654]  With this, but I think it's, again, he said he was angry.
[01:33:59.674 --> 01:34:00.875]  We're going to go back to him in just a moment.
[01:34:01.275 --> 01:34:02.335]  You've been asking forever.
[01:34:03.076 --> 01:34:10.299]  I've been so busy that we never got it done because it takes time to put them together, author them, get them out.
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:15.162]  So I had some of my local associates do it who don't even work for me.
[01:34:15.362 --> 01:34:20.164]  They work with me to master them and redo them, and they did a great job.
[01:34:21.716 --> 01:34:23.697]  You can get all of my other films.
[01:34:23.717 --> 01:34:27.779]  Remember I had seven films you couldn't get on DVD?
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:30.040]  My first seven films.
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:39.445]  Because I'm always so busy on the next story, the next report, so busy making the next film, literally working 18 hours a day many days, that I never had time to go back and do it.
[01:34:41.246 --> 01:34:47.309]  To go make new covers, to go and make the menus, to encode them, to send them off and manufacture them.
[01:34:48.422 --> 01:34:49.623]  Well, we now just got them in.
[01:34:49.943 --> 01:34:52.064]  But they came in this morning, UPS.
[01:34:52.764 --> 01:34:54.005]  They're not up on the shopping cart.
[01:34:54.045 --> 01:34:55.206]  You can't call and get them yet.
[01:34:55.566 --> 01:35:03.090]  I'm just letting you know that by tomorrow, maybe even tonight, you will be able to get Police State 1, 2, and 3.
[01:35:04.931 --> 01:35:07.612]  You will be able to get the Masters of Terror.
[01:35:08.373 --> 01:35:12.015]  You will be able to get Police State 3 total enslavement, as I mentioned.
[01:35:12.035 --> 01:35:12.735]  You'll be able to get...
[01:35:13.762 --> 01:35:18.466]  America Destroyed by Design, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed.
[01:35:20.567 --> 01:35:22.949]  My first seven films now on DVD.
[01:35:24.190 --> 01:35:29.593]  And by the way, I'm going to offer all seven of them together for $99.
[01:35:30.474 --> 01:35:31.535]  What's that come out to?
[01:35:37.139 --> 01:35:38.099]  It's a huge discount.
[01:35:40.921 --> 01:35:42.963]  And the police states all come together
[01:35:44.685 --> 01:35:45.566]  In a box set.
[01:35:47.327 --> 01:35:51.831]  Leave it to me to plug something that isn't even available, but we've got it here in the office.
[01:35:52.171 --> 01:35:54.713]  You'll be able to get it tonight or tomorrow.
[01:35:55.114 --> 01:35:59.217]  Ryan's building some big pages on Infowars.com on the Yahoo shopping cart.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.740]  And I am proud of my folks.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.781]  We're usually four or five days behind on shipping because we're a small operation.
[01:36:05.141 --> 01:36:07.381]  We get the orders and a few days to process and send it out.
[01:36:07.881 --> 01:36:09.582]  We are up to the day on shipping.
[01:36:09.702 --> 01:36:15.803]  Friday, if you ordered Friday, we were shipping it to you UPS ground, guaranteeing you'd get it a few days before Christmas.
[01:36:16.203 --> 01:36:19.103]  I can't say that'll happen now, but we're up to the day shipping.
[01:36:19.704 --> 01:36:27.445]  And I hope to keep it at this point now that we've gotten to this point to where we get the orders that day and they're shipped out that day or the next morning.
[01:36:28.055 --> 01:36:29.396]  We're trying to get modern.
[01:36:29.556 --> 01:36:32.857]  People expect stuff like today when they order it, today.
[01:36:33.897 --> 01:36:40.199]  But you can still go to Amazon.com and get Terror Storm, and you can get it shipped to you before Christmas.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:43.181]  They are still offering that for the next day or two.
[01:36:43.501 --> 01:36:44.941]  You can still get my new film, Terror Storm.
[01:36:45.241 --> 01:36:49.643]  The history of government-sponsored terror, which we're talking about today, is the foundation of the...
[01:36:50.407 --> 01:36:51.368]  Of the global police state.
[01:36:51.388 --> 01:36:53.289]  It's how they sell you on enslaving you.
[01:36:53.630 --> 01:37:02.376]  Oh, we're doing it so the terrorists don't get you, and every time you research it, it's government or private corporations that stand to gain from war, from terror.
[01:37:03.817 --> 01:37:04.778]  So get Terror Storm.
[01:37:05.599 --> 01:37:09.202]  I hope that you'll get America, Freedom to Fascism that we offer at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:10.403 --> 01:37:14.786]  We've got a bunch of specials that we're running until the end of the month.
[01:37:15.606 --> 01:37:16.486]  Huge discounts.
[01:37:16.506 --> 01:37:18.707]  Some of my films are as low as $5.95 a piece.
[01:37:18.747 --> 01:37:20.088]  T-shirts for $9.95.
[01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:21.889]  Pro-gun T-shirts.
[01:37:22.089 --> 01:37:23.229]  Anti-New World Order shirts.
[01:37:23.249 --> 01:37:26.370]  9-11 inside job shirts for as low as $9.95.
[01:37:28.871 --> 01:37:35.554]  And we also, until the end of the month, have the PrisonPlanet.tv special where you can get five months plus.
[01:37:35.654 --> 01:37:38.555]  It's 5.3 months free when you sign up for a year.
[01:37:38.575 --> 01:37:40.716]  So you pay for a little more than six months.
[01:37:40.756 --> 01:37:42.337]  You get five plus months free.
[01:37:43.985 --> 01:37:44.505]  I think we're good to go.
[01:38:06.354 --> 01:38:09.759]  We're going to put that interview together and put it up there for presentplanet.tv members.
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.882]  Barbara McLeod, great lady.
[01:38:11.983 --> 01:38:13.144]  She's so interesting.
[01:38:13.164 --> 01:38:16.489]  I'm going to have her back in studio on Thursday here in this studio.
[01:38:16.509 --> 01:38:18.773]  And that will be up there, too.
[01:38:19.724 --> 01:38:20.445]  We're good to go.
[01:38:42.777 --> 01:38:49.441]  We take the support that comes in here financially through the purchase of videos and books, and we put it right back into fighting the globalists.
[01:38:49.981 --> 01:38:51.202]  That is our total mission.
[01:38:51.702 --> 01:39:00.366]  So again, prisonplanet.tv, or call till free to get films, 1-888-253-3139, or order via infowars.com.
[01:39:00.466 --> 01:39:06.910]  Okay, let's go back to my guest, who I think I'm going to try to hold about 5-10 minutes in the next hour, because we need to go through this whole story.
[01:39:07.771 --> 01:39:10.254]  We're talking to Bill Bean, the filmmaker who was out there in 1993.
[01:39:11.595 --> 01:39:12.195]  Videotapes.
[01:39:12.215 --> 01:39:13.316]  It was clearly McVeigh.
[01:39:13.336 --> 01:39:14.898]  We'll go through the evidence of that in a few minutes.
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.621]  At this base, a year and a half.
[01:39:20.243 --> 01:39:20.824]  I made a mistake.
[01:39:20.864 --> 01:39:21.444]  I said a year.
[01:39:21.925 --> 01:39:24.407]  A year and a half after he was out of the military entirely.
[01:39:25.548 --> 01:39:26.669]  Washed up, basically.
[01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:31.133]  But the intel we have from state police, FBI, and others was he was really sheep-dipped.
[01:39:31.594 --> 01:39:32.034]  A U.S.
[01:39:32.054 --> 01:39:32.875]  government agent.
[01:39:33.493 --> 01:39:37.176]  Sheep dipping is when they take you into covert operations by claiming that you were discharged.
[01:39:37.576 --> 01:39:40.718]  Or there's extreme sheep dipping where they claim, you know, you died.
[01:39:41.019 --> 01:39:42.319]  There's thousands of those people.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.621]  Oh, they died in helicopter crash.
[01:39:45.402 --> 01:39:46.362]  They died in action.
[01:39:47.643 --> 01:39:48.784]  And really, it's a new identity.
[01:39:48.804 --> 01:39:51.726]  It's like in the film No Way Out.
[01:39:51.746 --> 01:39:52.487]  Well, who are these men?
[01:39:52.747 --> 01:39:53.648]  Are they with Special Forces?
[01:39:53.928 --> 01:39:56.670]  They're men associated with Special Forces.
[01:39:57.430 --> 01:40:00.152]  So, that's clearly what happened with McVeigh.
[01:40:00.252 --> 01:40:02.054]  Very distinguished in...
[01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:04.731]  In Desert Storm 1.
[01:40:05.131 --> 01:40:11.976]  Then he runs around the country to Waco and every gun show and every white supremacist group, creating a ledger, creating a history.
[01:40:12.416 --> 01:40:13.457]  Classic M.O.
[01:40:13.497 --> 01:40:17.300]  He hooks up with Iraqis we know are U.S.
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.040]  government agents.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.121]  But I'll detail that later.
[01:40:19.341 --> 01:40:20.542]  Let's get back to Mr. Bean.
[01:40:21.403 --> 01:40:24.925]  So bring me up to the time here.
[01:40:24.965 --> 01:40:26.026]  It's in the late 90s.
[01:40:27.207 --> 01:40:28.588]  Your friend sees this raw footage.
[01:40:28.608 --> 01:40:29.468]  He says, that's McVeigh.
[01:40:29.769 --> 01:40:31.430]  It's right when the trial's going in Denver.
[01:40:33.191 --> 01:40:34.733]  You still don't completely click.
[01:40:34.833 --> 01:40:38.157]  When did you click that that's why there'd been all this harassment?
[01:40:39.499 --> 01:40:50.611]  When I looked at the Internet and saw more of a detailed rundown of his life and of his military involvement and saw that no matter which side I went to, his military involvement ended and basically...
[01:40:51.903 --> 01:40:55.045]  Well, I'll be interested in seeing what will take place now.
[01:40:55.265 --> 01:41:01.209]  Let me tell you that I just got back from Washington, D.C., and I dropped off all this information over at Congressman Rohrabacher's office.
[01:41:19.967 --> 01:41:28.592]  And then they were going to have the hearings in December about reopening the investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:41:29.112 --> 01:41:30.573]  I went to Washington, D.C.
[01:41:31.534 --> 01:41:32.394]  I went to his office.
[01:41:32.454 --> 01:41:38.258]  I dropped off everything you have, the DVD, the blow-up of the photos, the forensics tests, all that.
[01:41:38.558 --> 01:41:41.440]  And they said, well, gee, thanks for bringing this in.
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:47.163]  And then the next thing I find out, they have canceled the hearings.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.481]  And I said, well, I'm ready to testify.
[01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:51.461]  And they said, oh.
[01:41:52.242 --> 01:41:53.762]  So now they canceled the hearing.
[01:41:53.822 --> 01:42:00.224]  But when did it finally all click for you that he was involved with the government, this is all connected to government, black ops?
[01:42:00.505 --> 01:42:02.485]  I mean, when did it really come rushing in on you?
[01:42:02.805 --> 01:42:12.769]  I'm sure by 2000, 2001, the event, the past seven years of my life then suddenly began to make sense to me.
[01:42:12.929 --> 01:42:15.070]  What happened to the harassment once you'd woken up?
[01:42:16.551 --> 01:42:20.493]  Well, it still continued until about 2004.
[01:42:21.513 --> 01:42:32.738]  And actually, people I spoke to about this said, well, once McVeigh was executed, or whatever took place there, did it stop then?
[01:42:33.398 --> 01:42:39.340]  No, not really, but it has seemed to have stopped in the last year or two, whatever that means.
[01:42:41.081 --> 01:42:43.802]  Did they say anything in phone calls or on the street?
[01:42:45.475 --> 01:42:52.377]  Where did it end with this former military intelligence guy who wanted to be your friend?
[01:42:52.837 --> 01:43:00.299]  Well, he was a nice guy, and I knew him from, let's say, January of 1996 until June of 1996.
[01:43:00.379 --> 01:43:03.820]  He was a nice person.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.620]  I have to tell you what his wife said to me one time.
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.021]  I went to his house to visit him.
[01:43:08.501 --> 01:43:13.062]  I was sitting with his wife in the kitchen, and she said to me,
[01:43:14.561 --> 01:43:23.247]  She mentioned his name, the husband, and she said, yeah, he was talking about you with a general in Washington last night.
[01:43:23.748 --> 01:43:27.791]  And I said to her, he was talking about me to a general in Washington?
[01:43:28.111 --> 01:43:29.172]  What is that supposed to mean?
[01:43:29.813 --> 01:43:35.457]  She began to say something, and then he walked into the room, and she changed the subject and would never ring it up again.
[01:43:36.198 --> 01:43:43.023]  So basically, in about June or so of 96, after I'd known these people for about six months,
[01:43:46.146 --> 01:43:57.589]  Everybody in my life just seemed to know too much about me, and I just felt pressure from all sides, and so I just basically ended my relationship with them.
[01:43:57.809 --> 01:44:03.611]  Did anybody advise you to make copies of this tape once you woke up to get it out to other sources so you'd be safe?
[01:44:03.631 --> 01:44:04.811]  No.
[01:44:05.774 --> 01:44:07.235]  People did mention that to me.
[01:44:07.656 --> 01:44:16.964]  Well, let me say, now you are safe, unless they do the very rare thing, a Blue Moon-type decision and kill you to intimidate everybody.
[01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:18.365]  But I don't think that's going to happen now.
[01:44:18.405 --> 01:44:21.447]  You're in a lot better position now.
[01:44:22.909 --> 01:44:25.931]  Now, let's talk about the vetting of this video.
[01:44:25.951 --> 01:44:29.014]  I mean, I'm looking at the stills of the video that we're going to be posting.
[01:44:29.034 --> 01:44:30.255]  We're also going to post the stills.
[01:44:32.198 --> 01:44:33.700]  This is McVeigh.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.982]  You can look at the teeth, the eyes, the eyebrows, the face.
[01:44:37.403 --> 01:44:39.144]  This looks just like his Army photos.
[01:44:39.164 --> 01:44:40.445]  This is him when he was younger, folks.
[01:44:40.925 --> 01:44:46.029]  And then his first arrest photos, then versus him in Terre Haute, Indiana, before execution.
[01:44:46.630 --> 01:44:48.431]  This is McVeigh.
[01:44:48.451 --> 01:44:49.252]  There is no doubt.
[01:44:49.612 --> 01:44:51.033]  Now, voice print's been done.
[01:44:51.273 --> 01:44:55.817]  A lot of vetting was done by Larry Flint's operation before they went with this.
[01:44:56.137 --> 01:45:00.741]  Go through the vetting, the voice print, the face analysis, all of this.
[01:45:01.521 --> 01:45:02.903]  That's an interesting fact, too.
[01:45:04.124 --> 01:45:13.652]  I had the video, and then I made copies of it, and then I wanted to get a voice analysis done.
[01:45:13.812 --> 01:45:22.280]  So I went to a place in Wisconsin here, not far from Chicago, and again, I told no one I was doing this, but again, to show you that they were watching me.
[01:45:23.395 --> 01:45:38.562]  I went to the place that did the forensics voice work, didn't make a reservation, just walked up to the door and knocked and entered, and the person who owned the place and did the actual work wasn't there, but their secretaries and aides were there.
[01:45:39.022 --> 01:45:40.022]  They said, how can we help you?
[01:45:40.042 --> 01:45:47.806]  And I said, well, I've got Tim McVeigh on tape, and what I want to do is do a voice match to see, okay, does the voice match?
[01:45:47.826 --> 01:45:50.187]  This is Tim McVeigh as far as the forensics work goes.
[01:45:50.845 --> 01:45:52.606]  And they said, well, yeah, we can do that.
[01:45:53.326 --> 01:46:02.129]  And for those that don't know, the best way to do it, the way they did it with the fake Bin Laden tape, the fat Bin Laden, very shoddy job, is you take a real Bin Laden tape and create a voice key.
[01:46:02.169 --> 01:46:06.851]  That's what you use with voice ID on your phone system or your security system at your office or house, folks.
[01:46:07.111 --> 01:46:09.652]  This has been well-developed for over a decade.
[01:46:10.232 --> 01:46:10.652]  And then...
[01:46:11.514 --> 01:46:13.416]  Well, actually, what happened there is it never took place.
[01:46:35.427 --> 01:46:37.828]  They asked to see the tape, so I played it for them.
[01:46:38.548 --> 01:46:40.849]  And then I said, now I'm going to have to tell you something.
[01:46:40.889 --> 01:46:44.050]  I said, I'm under surveillance and harassment here.
[01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:46.171]  And they said, oh, what do you mean by that?
[01:46:46.211 --> 01:46:47.511]  And so I told them the whole story.
[01:46:48.031 --> 01:46:51.913]  So while I'm telling them the story, they get two hang-up phone calls.
[01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:56.614]  And I said to them, this happens all the time now.
[01:46:57.355 --> 01:46:59.395]  And they said, okay.
[01:46:59.816 --> 01:47:03.517]  So basically, they made an appointment for me to come in a few days later
[01:47:04.028 --> 01:47:06.650]  Bring in the tape, because I didn't want to let it out of my sight.
[01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:11.733]  And then they would do the forensics test while I was there.
[01:47:12.874 --> 01:47:13.314]  I left.
[01:47:13.414 --> 01:47:20.178]  I called them a few days later, and they informed me they would not be able to do the forensics voice test on there.
[01:47:20.919 --> 01:47:23.721]  So to make a long story short, who did you finally get to do the voice analysis?
[01:47:23.921 --> 01:47:26.002]  I went to the University of Utah.
[01:47:26.222 --> 01:47:30.605]  There's a Professor Blomgren at the speech department there.
[01:47:31.406 --> 01:47:32.686]  And Professor Blomgren...
[01:47:34.503 --> 01:47:39.070]  Has all the sophisticated computers and... And I have his report here.
[01:47:39.190 --> 01:47:40.633]  His report, yeah, I sent you that.
[01:47:41.394 --> 01:47:46.822]  And, yeah, he's... You can read the report and certainly get...
[01:47:47.685 --> 01:48:04.058]  For instance, the soldier in the tank, his voice comes out to like 153 cycles a second, and the known McVeigh voice from 60 Minutes interview was 151 cycles a second.
[01:48:05.619 --> 01:48:10.102]  Both of these, they're so nearly exact, and they're above the norm, which is...
[01:48:11.553 --> 01:48:15.474]  The norm is like 125 to 145 cycles a second.
[01:48:15.774 --> 01:48:20.255]  Anything above 145 cycles makes you then seem to have a high voice.
[01:48:20.375 --> 01:48:30.878]  So he went off just the overall tonal quality and the different pitch cycles, so the tape wasn't good enough to do a voice print comparison?
[01:48:31.499 --> 01:48:32.459]  That I'm not sure.
[01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:35.040]  I do know that he also used...
[01:48:37.799 --> 01:48:52.786]  Ten other people to repeat the same phrases that the soldier in the tank used, and then they compared all those different people to a voice of McVeigh, and then had independent people listen.
[01:48:53.422 --> 01:48:58.446]  And say, which individual is this individual?
[01:48:58.567 --> 01:49:05.933]  Now, in the report, the scientist is saying that the video quality was moderate, but that he was still able to do a good test.
[01:49:06.113 --> 01:49:09.476]  So it probably wasn't good enough to do an actual voice print.
[01:49:09.956 --> 01:49:13.817]  Well, he's clunking around there with his shoes and stuff.
[01:49:13.917 --> 01:49:18.918]  Yeah, he says mouth-to-microphone distance was inconsistent as the subject was moving around the recording.
[01:49:18.958 --> 01:49:25.460]  So the sound of the tank, of the metal in the shoes, that's what doesn't allow, I guess, a perfect voice print.
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:29.201]  But the professor basically says that he believes it's the same person?
[01:49:29.401 --> 01:49:30.201]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:30.761]  Yeah, it's like 86%.
[01:49:30.822 --> 01:49:31.022]  Sure.
[01:49:33.297 --> 01:49:33.797]  Sure.
[01:49:34.138 --> 01:49:37.299]  He asked me, did I want him to testify in a court of law?
[01:49:37.359 --> 01:49:39.941]  And I said, well, I hope so, but I'm not ready yet.
[01:49:40.781 --> 01:49:41.281]  Well, stay there.
[01:49:41.381 --> 01:49:43.062]  Let's talk about the face analysis.
[01:49:43.122 --> 01:49:44.643]  The analysis, I mean, I can just look at it.
[01:49:44.683 --> 01:49:49.046]  It's McVeigh, but an analysis was done of that as well.
[01:49:49.366 --> 01:49:51.387]  And we'll talk about why this is so important.
[01:49:56.565 --> 01:49:59.746]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.086 --> 01:50:02.026]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.386 --> 01:50:10.048]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.728 --> 01:50:17.789]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.170 --> 01:50:21.130]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:23.811]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.

[01:52:32.527 --> 01:52:33.188]  We're good to go.
[01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:12.902]  They play their games.
[01:53:13.923 --> 01:53:14.883]  We play ours.
[01:53:16.685 --> 01:53:17.685]  Welcome back.
[01:53:42.114 --> 01:53:43.335]  Bill Bean is our guest.
[01:53:47.358 --> 01:53:48.519]  Sir, let's continue.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:54:02.290]  For those that just joined us, a full year and a half after Timothy McVeigh is supposedly out of the military, he is at this military base in the Dakotas, Camp Grafton.
[01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:05.512]  Our guest is out there scouting for a film he wants to make.
[01:54:05.552 --> 01:54:07.914]  He's shooting video of it, as you do on locations.
[01:54:08.726 --> 01:54:09.666]  Location scouting.
[01:54:10.146 --> 01:54:13.087]  Everybody's nice to him until he films McVeigh, who looks like McVeigh.
[01:54:14.048 --> 01:54:15.048]  And the guy freaks out.
[01:54:15.928 --> 01:54:26.332]  The point is that we know from our own separate research, state police, police officers, FBI, investigators, press reporters, I mean, they kill cops over this, like Terrence Yagey.
[01:54:26.852 --> 01:54:28.232]  There were bombs in the buildings.
[01:54:28.332 --> 01:54:29.953]  The fuel oil bomb was a diversion.
[01:54:30.433 --> 01:54:32.834]  We got photos by pilots.
[01:54:33.659 --> 01:54:40.561]  A few weeks before Oklahoma City bombing of a Ryder truck being loaded with what looks like a fuel oil tank.
[01:54:42.461 --> 01:54:43.341]  All of this together.
[01:54:43.421 --> 01:54:56.704]  We know that Al-Husseini Hussain, this has even come out in court, was an Iraqi Republican guard trained by our government in the 80s when Saddam was our ally, brought back in with 5,000 other Iraqis by Bush Sr., 3,000, Bill Clinton, 2,000 more.
[01:55:00.091 --> 01:55:00.591]  We're good to go.
[01:55:00.812 --> 01:55:01.032]  I think?
[01:55:16.718 --> 01:55:17.698]  It was the same old story.
[01:55:17.738 --> 01:55:20.399]  Topless bars, restaurants, just like with 9-11.
[01:55:20.919 --> 01:55:22.240]  All these Arabs with McVeigh.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.001]  That way, if they got caught in the diversionary blast, the government could say, oh, look, it's Arabs.
[01:55:27.561 --> 01:55:29.702]  Then the state police arrested some of them.
[01:55:29.762 --> 01:55:31.223]  Clinton ordered them released.
[01:55:33.303 --> 01:55:34.083]  John Doe No.
[01:55:34.103 --> 01:55:34.424]  2, folks.
[01:55:34.784 --> 01:55:35.744]  Al-Husseini Hussein.
[01:55:38.328 --> 01:55:39.229]  This is unbelievable.
[01:55:39.609 --> 01:55:46.934]  We have police surveillance footage of the Iraqis that the state police released and the Oklahoma City police released in my film.
[01:55:46.954 --> 01:55:50.276]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:55:50.296 --> 01:55:52.158]  45 minutes of that three-hour film was Oklahoma.
[01:55:52.178 --> 01:55:53.599]  It's really three films in one.
[01:55:53.619 --> 01:55:56.101]  I mean, that's how surveilled they were.
[01:55:56.561 --> 01:55:58.302]  We've had the police here on air, folks.
[01:55:58.582 --> 01:55:59.143]  They told you.
[01:55:59.383 --> 01:56:00.063]  These are U.S.
[01:56:00.243 --> 01:56:01.224]  government agents.
[01:56:01.484 --> 01:56:02.145]  Period.
[01:56:02.805 --> 01:56:03.406]  Period.
[01:56:04.246 --> 01:56:05.247]  And so is McVeigh.
[01:56:06.201 --> 01:56:07.421]  Now, did they really kill him?
[01:56:07.981 --> 01:56:10.342]  Did they stage his death?
[01:56:10.582 --> 01:56:14.283]  Big press reports reported his chest was still moving when he was pushed out.
[01:56:14.343 --> 01:56:16.383]  That was in mainstream news.
[01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:17.263]  I don't know.
[01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.803]  You see, that's cloak and dagger.
[01:56:18.843 --> 01:56:21.724]  It's so bizarre you never know what is really going on.
[01:56:21.984 --> 01:56:23.564]  But we do know that he was a U.S.
[01:56:23.604 --> 01:56:24.265]  government agent.
[01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:28.885]  And now it's broken nationally in a national magazine.
[01:56:29.926 --> 01:56:31.606]  We have the exclusive video going up.
[01:56:32.276 --> 01:56:36.700]  In the next few hours, we're going to have the photos, the video, Paul Watson's writing a report.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:38.001]  I want this to be a good one.
[01:56:38.301 --> 01:56:40.042]  They're all good, but this is really important.
[01:56:40.322 --> 01:56:41.844]  We ought to get video of McVeigh, too.
[01:56:42.584 --> 01:56:45.346]  We're also getting the audio clip before you actually play it on air here.
[01:56:45.827 --> 01:56:46.908]  Let me go back to our guests.
[01:56:46.928 --> 01:56:51.031]  We have another unbelievable guest coming on, or I would keep our guests for the next hour.
[01:56:51.071 --> 01:56:53.333]  I wish we could, but we'll keep them a little bit into the next hour.
[01:56:54.013 --> 01:56:55.975]  Our other guest is a top professor, wrote the U.S.
[01:56:55.995 --> 01:56:57.196]  Biological Weapons Treaty.
[01:56:57.556 --> 01:57:01.319]  He's going public with government involvement in the anthrax attacks.
[01:57:02.653 --> 01:57:03.713]  It just never ends.
[01:57:03.733 --> 01:57:05.694]  People always say, well, people go public.
[01:57:05.714 --> 01:57:06.454]  People find out.
[01:57:06.514 --> 01:57:07.154]  People know.
[01:57:07.514 --> 01:57:08.055]  They do.
[01:57:09.195 --> 01:57:09.655]  Stay there.
[01:57:11.715 --> 01:57:18.537]  Bill, because I want to come back to you after this 60-second break and hit some of the other key points here.
[01:57:18.597 --> 01:57:21.558]  And it's clear we've got to do another interview on this subject.
[01:57:21.998 --> 01:57:24.219]  Folks, do you realize the magnitude of this?
[01:57:24.719 --> 01:57:25.459]  We have...
[01:57:26.357 --> 01:57:32.199]  Timothy McVeigh on video in the military at a base a year and a half after... Oh, it's incredible.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:38.001]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.041 --> 01:57:38.462]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.602 --> 01:57:39.222]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.382 --> 01:57:43.924]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.204 --> 01:57:49.065]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.346 --> 01:57:57.207]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.887 --> 01:58:01.511]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.091 --> 01:58:06.174]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:23.494 --> 01:58:24.395]  We're talking to Bill Beam.
[01:58:24.455 --> 01:58:25.296]  He's on with us.
[01:58:25.356 --> 01:58:27.438]  He got footage of what's clearly Timothy McVeigh.
[01:58:27.938 --> 01:58:41.950]  A professor who's an expert in this did a voice print analysis, that is a cadence test, and said that it is conclusive that he would testify in court that it is the same person as Timothy McVeigh.
[01:58:42.551 --> 01:58:45.734]  Then there was also analysis done of the face, wasn't there?
[01:58:45.754 --> 01:58:47.715]  Not too much about that.
[01:58:49.364 --> 01:58:59.991]  I know they do a thing where they look at the position of the pupils with the tip of the nose or something, but anything as far as the features on the face went, and specifically on the teeth.
[01:59:00.311 --> 01:59:07.016]  It's a biometric measurement, and you can clearly, and of course human eye, the brain knows how to do this.
[01:59:07.256 --> 01:59:08.517]  That's how you recognize somebody.
[01:59:08.837 --> 01:59:11.499]  I look at it, it's the eyes, the same nose, the same teeth.
[01:59:11.799 --> 01:59:12.420]  It's McVeigh.
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:18.384]  Yeah, McVeigh, your two front central teeth, they're called your central incisors.
[01:59:18.724 --> 01:59:20.165]  He's got bunny rabbit teeth.
[01:59:20.205 --> 01:59:22.025]  Yeah, on McVeigh, they go straight down.
[01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:27.587]  Now, the teeth on either side of those two central teeth are called your lateral incisors.
[01:59:27.887 --> 01:59:29.548]  In McVeigh, they slant in.
[01:59:29.568 --> 01:59:37.131]  This is very noticeable in photographs where he smiles, and it's there in the photograph of the soldier in the tank, too.
[01:59:37.191 --> 01:59:39.031]  I mean, there's no question it is McVeigh.
[01:59:40.012 --> 01:59:42.093]  No, there's no question that it's McVeigh.
[01:59:44.833 --> 01:59:54.599]  This story is going to have a huge effect, because this just adds... You know, now since you learned the truth about Oklahoma City, and all the evidence of the other U.S.
[01:59:54.639 --> 02:00:01.823]  government agents involved, and McVeigh clearly being the patsy, and then McVeigh is drooling on the side of the highway saying, I've got a chip in my butt.
[02:00:02.103 --> 02:00:02.604]  Remember that?
[02:00:02.924 --> 02:00:03.204]  Yeah.
[02:00:03.604 --> 02:00:05.785]  I mean, clearly, I don't believe he really had one.
[02:00:05.825 --> 02:00:07.546]  That was like some mind control trigger.
[02:00:08.087 --> 02:00:09.528]  I mean, this is a bizarre story.
[02:00:10.228 --> 02:00:13.210]  And then the admitted top mind control doctor, Jolly and West...
[02:00:13.650 --> 02:00:14.891]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[02:00:14.931 --> 02:00:16.652]  Was he his federally appointed doctor?
[02:00:16.672 --> 02:00:23.317]  Yeah, and a good point about going to Hustler was, you know, Hustler was the last place I went to.
[02:00:24.018 --> 02:00:31.123]  I tried, let me tell you, I went to 60 Minutes and 20-20 and Nightline and Frontline and Chicago Tribune and on and on and on.
[02:00:31.932 --> 02:00:45.296]  And for the people that would look at what I had, I'd give them the video, I'd give them the blow-ups, the captures from the video, I'd give them the forensics report, I would give them everything I had, just like I gave you, and...
[02:00:47.489 --> 02:00:55.912]  Maybe a week or so later, I would get everything back, and I would get a statement from them saying, we choose not to follow this, or we choose not to get involved with this subject.
[02:00:56.752 --> 02:01:02.454]  Or, I'm not going to name any names, but I went to somebody at a large newspaper here in Chicago.
[02:01:03.095 --> 02:01:10.717]  He looked at everything, and the first thing he told me, and the next week was, he says, oh no, I checked with the military, and McVeigh wasn't in the military.
[02:01:10.737 --> 02:01:12.738]  And I said to him, you're looking at the pictures yourself.
[02:01:13.507 --> 02:01:15.028]  I saw him the next week after that.
[02:01:15.048 --> 02:01:17.969]  He handed everything back to me, and he says, Look, I'm sorry.
[02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:19.530]  It is McVeigh.
[02:01:19.770 --> 02:01:22.412]  I know what you're saying is true, but I can't help you.
[02:01:22.512 --> 02:01:23.432]  I don't know who can.
[02:01:24.012 --> 02:01:24.873]  Who was this reporter?
[02:01:25.073 --> 02:01:26.253]  Well, I don't want to give his name.
[02:01:26.334 --> 02:01:29.675]  He was with one of the major newspapers here in Chicago.
[02:01:29.695 --> 02:01:31.556]  You know, I don't blame these people personally.
[02:01:31.576 --> 02:01:32.076]  So they know.
[02:01:32.237 --> 02:01:34.678]  I mean, so they're point blank agreeing with you, but saying we can't do it.
[02:01:34.858 --> 02:01:35.898]  Yeah, they were afraid.
[02:01:36.439 --> 02:01:37.019]  They were afraid.
[02:01:37.691 --> 02:01:38.973]  And I went, let me add this.
[02:01:39.313 --> 02:01:43.019]  Well, I'll tell you what they should be afraid of is living in a society where everybody's afraid.
[02:01:43.299 --> 02:01:47.124]  When you have a society of cowards, then you better be afraid of what's going to happen.
[02:01:47.365 --> 02:01:47.665]  Sure.
[02:01:47.685 --> 02:01:49.447]  You see, I'm afraid of not standing up.
[02:01:49.848 --> 02:01:51.831]  I'm afraid of what happens if you're a wimp.
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:54.541]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:54.761 --> 02:02:03.391]  Yeah, and again, I went to lawyer after lawyer after lawyer just before I knew it was McVeigh, just trying to seek some, how do I handle this?
[02:02:03.411 --> 02:02:04.392]  What am I supposed to do?
[02:02:04.953 --> 02:02:13.983]  And at first they'd just think I'm a kook, and then when I'd bring in all the information and I videotaped cars following me and I got the license plate numbers and I have all this.
[02:02:14.663 --> 02:02:21.485]  And then once they were convinced themselves that it was true, they would just hold up their hand and say, nobody here can help you.
[02:02:21.705 --> 02:02:23.825]  And that's all I heard for years from lawyers.
[02:02:25.406 --> 02:02:29.527]  Well, the publication you got to send is known for breaking huge national stories.
[02:02:29.567 --> 02:02:30.627]  This is going to go big.
[02:02:31.027 --> 02:02:32.607]  We're here trying to ensure that happens.
[02:02:32.687 --> 02:02:37.249]  And with the video you gave us, which is a total exclusive, folks, it's going up on the web real quick.
[02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:43.230]  And it looks like we might have some Internet attacks going on right now, so that's another indicator.
[02:02:48.687 --> 02:02:51.868]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.208 --> 02:02:54.148]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.508 --> 02:03:02.170]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.850 --> 02:03:09.891]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.292 --> 02:03:13.252]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.632 --> 02:03:15.953]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.373 --> 02:03:17.193]  NSA spies.
[02:03:18.383 --> 02:03:21.725]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:22.026 --> 02:03:25.528]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.009 --> 02:03:27.670]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.251 --> 02:03:32.174]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.501 --> 02:03:47.323]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:03:47.663 --> 02:03:49.204]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:03:49.605 --> 02:03:49.865]  What?
[02:03:50.205 --> 02:03:50.585]  Again?
[02:03:51.006 --> 02:03:52.627]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:03:52.687 --> 02:03:57.111]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:03:57.351 --> 02:03:58.632]  Why did you do that?
[02:03:58.852 --> 02:04:04.657]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:04:04.957 --> 02:04:05.978]  Are we there yet?
[02:04:06.078 --> 02:04:07.159]  for the entire trip.
[02:04:07.399 --> 02:04:09.601]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:04:10.082 --> 02:04:11.083]  Great idea.
[02:04:11.103 --> 02:04:13.945]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:04:14.304 --> 02:04:16.770]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:21.380]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:04:21.661 --> 02:04:21.962]  Honey?
[02:04:22.782 --> 02:04:24.023]  You're terrific!
[02:04:24.423 --> 02:04:25.904]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[02:04:26.024 --> 02:04:29.425]  You're the one that bought the family our sport Berkey water bottles.
[02:04:29.705 --> 02:04:30.486]  Now, can we stop?
[02:04:30.986 --> 02:04:31.726]  I need to go, too.
[02:04:32.027 --> 02:04:36.469]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.529 --> 02:04:36.829]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.869 --> 02:04:38.430]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:45.740]  It's a fact.
[02:04:45.921 --> 02:04:50.364]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:04:50.704 --> 02:04:55.907]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:59.390]  So why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[02:04:59.650 --> 02:05:06.775]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:05:07.115 --> 02:05:14.280]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.642]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[02:05:17.042 --> 02:05:25.527]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in fear.
[02:05:25.848 --> 02:05:27.409]  It's time to turn your life around.
[02:05:27.749 --> 02:05:29.210]  Call Day of Jubilee.
[02:05:29.410 --> 02:05:30.311]  Open 9 a.m.
[02:05:30.371 --> 02:05:31.191]  to 5 p.m.
[02:05:31.231 --> 02:05:32.732]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[02:05:32.792 --> 02:05:33.153]  That's 920-293-8024.
[02:05:33.273 --> 02:05:34.233]  And ask for Robert.
[02:05:34.273 --> 02:05:37.255]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:51.461]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.842 --> 02:06:11.026]  Bill Bean had the voice analysis done by one of the top experts in our country on it, by a professor out in Utah, and he said he'll testify in court, this is the voice of Tim McVeigh.
[02:06:11.046 --> 02:06:12.846]  Now understand, they're inside an armored vehicle,
[02:06:13.576 --> 02:06:22.901]  With the engine running, but still they were able to analyze his 60 minutes interview before his, quote, execution, integrated with this.
[02:06:23.181 --> 02:06:26.643]  And it is conclusive, this is Tim McVeigh.
[02:06:26.663 --> 02:06:28.524]  And you look at the video of it, I mean, it's him.
[02:06:29.305 --> 02:06:33.967]  He's got the bunny rabbit teeth with the teeth beside those going inwards.
[02:06:34.308 --> 02:06:36.629]  He's got the same eye, same eyebrows, same face.
[02:06:37.361 --> 02:06:41.066]  He's just a couple years younger than the guy that we saw arrested in 1995.
[02:06:41.446 --> 02:06:42.587]  This was 1993.
[02:06:43.028 --> 02:06:44.310]  Here is a 20-second clip.
[02:06:45.211 --> 02:06:46.012]  What's your job?
[02:06:46.733 --> 02:06:47.073]  What's up?
[02:06:47.213 --> 02:06:47.914]  What's your job?
[02:06:48.495 --> 02:06:49.356]  I'm a parts clerk.
[02:06:49.556 --> 02:06:51.759]  Oh, you're just parking this one, huh?
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.182]  Yeah, basically.
[02:06:54.622 --> 02:06:56.304]  Okay, thanks.
[02:06:56.685 --> 02:06:56.805]  Yep.
[02:06:58.476 --> 02:06:59.817]  And boy, you see him.
[02:06:59.857 --> 02:07:01.438]  He is upset on the video.
[02:07:01.918 --> 02:07:02.558]  And there's more of it.
[02:07:02.578 --> 02:07:05.980]  We're going to put the video up on the web, the stills, the photos, all of it.
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:09.982]  But this meshes with the state police, the FBI agents, everybody we've talked to.
[02:07:10.042 --> 02:07:11.863]  He was in a covert government operation.
[02:07:12.483 --> 02:07:17.125]  Supposedly, he thought when he got hired out of the military to infiltrate white supremacist groups and others.
[02:07:17.605 --> 02:07:24.729]  Then he's on the side of the road, you know, drooling when the state police pick him up minutes after the OKC bomb went off.
[02:07:25.709 --> 02:07:31.610]  And we have video, and we've talked to the FBI agents who saw the video of these Arabs with McVeigh.
[02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:44.113]  Then we know who those Arabs are because they got picked up by police, and the police were already surveilling them, the state police were, and we have that footage of Al-Husseini, Hussein, and others, who were clearly trained by the U.S.
[02:07:44.133 --> 02:07:46.393]  government in the 80s, brought back in by Bush Sr.
[02:07:46.713 --> 02:07:50.654]  in the early 1990s, and part of some larger black-op operation.
[02:07:52.064 --> 02:07:57.587]  I've got my next guest lined up, and I really appreciate you coming on, Mr. Bean.
[02:07:58.207 --> 02:08:00.989]  Any other key points you want to close out with that's clear?
[02:08:01.009 --> 02:08:08.392]  We'll have to do a part two and have you back on so we can take questions from the audience maybe later this week or next week if you've got the time, sir.
[02:08:08.893 --> 02:08:09.133]  Sure.
[02:08:09.173 --> 02:08:10.253]  I'd be glad to.
[02:08:11.094 --> 02:08:13.915]  Any other points or facets that we missed that you haven't covered?
[02:08:14.515 --> 02:08:18.517]  Well, the one important thing here is that nobody I went to...
[02:08:20.151 --> 02:08:31.401]  And you said that major national publications said, we know it's McVeigh, it's too scary, we're not going to talk to you, but Hustler, the last place you went, did.
[02:08:31.841 --> 02:08:35.364]  Yeah, I went out to L.A.
[02:08:35.545 --> 02:08:37.246]  and I called Hustler on the phone.
[02:08:37.306 --> 02:08:41.490]  I said, I've got the videotape, Tim McVeigh, blah, blah, blah, and all this, and
[02:08:42.242 --> 02:08:43.984]  I said, do you want to see it?
[02:08:44.024 --> 02:08:45.945]  And they said, can you be here in 45 minutes?
[02:08:46.025 --> 02:08:54.192]  I was there in 45 minutes, and they had a room full of people sitting there, and they had me replay it over and over and over and over again, and they asked me, what's the significance of this?
[02:08:54.993 --> 02:08:58.296]  And I gave them the explanation like I have to you, and...
[02:09:00.174 --> 02:09:07.243]  Now, they didn't just take my word for it, because they spent months on their own investigating this to make sure everything I was saying was true.
[02:09:07.263 --> 02:09:07.563]  No, I know.
[02:09:07.603 --> 02:09:18.216]  They just interviewed me and Dr. Stephen Jones on 9-11, and they spent months vetting it and months calling us and months wanting this and months wanting that, and I've never seen media...
[02:09:18.977 --> 02:09:26.259]  Do this with me before, and I've been interviewed by hundreds of newspapers, hundreds of magazines, 50-plus times national TV.
[02:09:26.559 --> 02:09:28.680]  I've never experienced this type of vetting.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:35.862]  So, I mean, you've got to... You give the credit that they're due there for what they are doing.
[02:09:36.162 --> 02:09:36.882]  That's what I say.
[02:09:37.871 --> 02:09:38.231]  All right.
[02:09:38.271 --> 02:09:40.011]  Well, we appreciate you coming on.
[02:09:40.031 --> 02:09:41.212]  This is a huge report.
[02:09:41.252 --> 02:09:42.672]  Thank you for sharing the video with us.
[02:09:43.012 --> 02:09:48.493]  We'll be exclusively posting that in the next couple hours up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:48.813 --> 02:09:49.773]  Thank you so much.
[02:09:49.793 --> 02:09:51.053]  Alex, I love your show.
[02:09:51.333 --> 02:09:53.934]  I love your show, and I think it helps a lot across the nation.
[02:09:54.014 --> 02:09:54.274]  I do.
[02:09:54.634 --> 02:09:55.234]  Well, thank you.
[02:09:55.274 --> 02:09:57.994]  We appreciate you, and Godspeed.
[02:09:58.194 --> 02:10:01.295]  Perhaps I could get you back up maybe for Part 2 on Friday or something?
[02:10:01.415 --> 02:10:01.955]  On Friday?
[02:10:01.995 --> 02:10:03.615]  Yeah, I'd be able to do that on Friday.
[02:10:03.855 --> 02:10:05.836]  Okay, well, I'll have my producer get in touch with you.
[02:10:06.056 --> 02:10:06.336]  Great.
[02:10:06.376 --> 02:10:07.116]  That would be perfect.
[02:10:07.336 --> 02:10:08.977]  There goes Bill Bean, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:10.218 --> 02:10:16.641]  Didn't know why he was being harassed, didn't know all this stuff was happening, and then one day they're there watching an old video they'd shot, and there's McVeigh.
[02:10:16.941 --> 02:10:19.782]  And he still didn't know exactly, he just knew that's important.
[02:10:20.182 --> 02:10:22.844]  And then he found out he'd been out of the military for a year and a half.
[02:10:23.264 --> 02:10:28.527]  This is at a demolitions, specializing in demolitions base, and there's old McVeigh right there.
[02:10:28.707 --> 02:10:34.950]  Then the BATF, even the History Channel has reported, was practicing blowing up rider trucks...
[02:10:36.115 --> 02:10:40.816]  In the desert, what was it, Arizona, in the six months before.
[02:10:40.836 --> 02:11:03.480]  And then the BATF, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, runs up to the local doctor, who later died mysteriously, and the police officer, Terrence Yakey, Cop of the Year, he was killed, he was murdered, tortured to death, because he was reporting the BATF ran up in full bomb gear and then demanded the doctors patch them up and claim they'd been on the 9th floor.
[02:11:04.893 --> 02:11:07.836]  And being a good cop, Terrence Yeagey said, something's going on here.
[02:11:08.276 --> 02:11:10.618]  And boy, they stabbed him and tortured him for hours.
[02:11:11.539 --> 02:11:12.780]  And then had the nerve to call it.
[02:11:13.301 --> 02:11:17.584]  All those stab wounds all over his body, bound hands, handcuff marks.
[02:11:18.285 --> 02:11:23.750]  He called his partner minutes before he disappeared and said, I'm being followed by a car full of feds.
[02:11:24.130 --> 02:11:27.553]  And we've had some of his colleagues here on the show.
[02:11:27.633 --> 02:11:30.316]  Police officers in Oklahoma saying the feds killed him.
[02:11:30.536 --> 02:11:31.657]  All right, I'm going to shut up about that.
[02:11:32.984 --> 02:11:39.145]  I apologize to our illustrious guest, an amazing individual with so many letters I can't even begin to tell you.
[02:11:39.645 --> 02:11:44.346]  Francis A. Boyle, a scholar in the area of international law, human rights professor.
[02:11:44.406 --> 02:11:45.666]  Boyle received a J.D.
[02:11:45.686 --> 02:11:48.527]  degree, magna cum laude, and Ph.D.
[02:11:49.427 --> 02:11:53.348]  degrees in political science from Harvard University prior to joining the faculty at the College of Law.
[02:11:53.668 --> 02:11:57.389]  He was a teaching fellow at Harvard, an associate at its Center for International Affairs.
[02:11:57.429 --> 02:11:59.769]  He also practiced tax international law.
[02:12:00.763 --> 02:12:02.505]  We're good to go.
[02:12:20.968 --> 02:12:23.209]  He was on the board of directors for Amnesty International.
[02:12:23.649 --> 02:12:25.349]  Really, I can't say enough about him.
[02:12:25.789 --> 02:12:27.750]  And a month ago, I got this book.
[02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:29.370]  I meant to give it to my producer.
[02:12:29.610 --> 02:12:31.091]  I forgot it was on my desk.
[02:12:31.691 --> 02:12:38.052]  And just today, we noticed, hey, we've already got his book, or one of his many books, Destroying World Order.
[02:12:38.092 --> 02:12:39.273]  I should get him on just about this.
[02:12:39.873 --> 02:12:40.133]  U.S.
[02:12:40.193 --> 02:12:42.774]  Imperialism in the Middle East, before and after September 11th.
[02:12:43.254 --> 02:12:44.174]  Francis A. Boyle.
[02:12:44.914 --> 02:12:47.595]  And he's also written another book on...
[02:12:49.332 --> 02:12:55.995]  Well, thank you for having me on, Alex, and my best to your listening audience, and keep up the good work.
[02:12:56.055 --> 02:12:58.636]  I don't listen to you during the day or anything.
[02:12:58.716 --> 02:13:00.356]  I'm kind of busy, but I do periodically get...
[02:13:16.491 --> 02:13:23.614]  Reports on the Internet of important interviews you've done, and I try to look at them when I get home at night.
[02:13:23.954 --> 02:13:28.276]  Well, we're glad that we're contributing, but not as much as you are in this area of the anthrax.
[02:13:28.596 --> 02:13:30.817]  For those that may forget, this was five years ago.
[02:13:31.817 --> 02:13:35.439]  Sixty-seven percent of adults over 40 don't even know what year it happened.
[02:13:35.759 --> 02:13:43.762]  So perhaps we should go back and recap what on the surface happened and then go through why you're questioning the official story.
[02:13:45.143 --> 02:13:45.343]  Right.
[02:13:45.443 --> 02:14:04.891]  Well, after the attacks on September 11th, the Bush administration tried to ram through the USA Patriot Act right through Congress that basically would have, if not already, had set up a police state.
[02:14:05.591 --> 02:14:13.514]  And we know for a fact that the Patriot Act had already been drafted and was sitting on Ashcroft's desk as of September 10th.
[02:14:14.847 --> 02:14:23.313]  Now, Senators Daschle and Laney were holding it up because they realized what this would lead to.
[02:14:23.393 --> 02:14:27.716]  Indeed, the first draft of the Patriot Act, they would have suspended the writ of habeas corpus.
[02:14:28.916 --> 02:14:34.360]  And all of a sudden then, out of nowhere, come these anthrax attacks.
[02:14:35.481 --> 02:14:44.267]  And at the time, I didn't know myself precisely what was going on, either with respect to September 11th or the...
[02:14:45.169 --> 02:14:46.350]  Uh, anthrax attacks.
[02:14:47.250 --> 02:14:54.853]  Uh, but then the New York Times revealed the technology behind the letter to Senator Daschle.
[02:14:57.394 --> 02:15:03.758]  A trillion spores per gram, special electrostatic treatment so it floats in air.
[02:15:04.158 --> 02:15:06.360]  This is ultra, this is ultra high tech.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:22.991]  This is super weapons grade anthrax that even the United States government, in its openly proclaimed programs, but we had one before Nixon, had never developed before.
[02:15:23.726 --> 02:15:49.115]  So it was obvious to me, based on the work I had done drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, and that act actually was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Bush Sr., it was obvious to me then that this was from a U.S.
[02:15:49.155 --> 02:15:49.835]  government lab.
[02:15:49.915 --> 02:15:52.056]  There was nowhere else you could have gotten that.
[02:15:52.876 --> 02:16:14.202]  So immediately after reading that New York Times article, I did call a very high-level official in the FBI who deals with terrorism and counterterrorism, Spike Bowman, whom I had met at a terrorism conference at the University of Michigan Law School where we both spoke.
[02:16:14.962 --> 02:16:17.923]  And there was a panel there on biological weapons.
[02:16:17.963 --> 02:16:20.004]  I was not on that particular panel.
[02:16:20.024 --> 02:16:20.944]  I gave another paper.
[02:16:21.993 --> 02:16:42.470]  But he was aware of the work I had done in this field, and I immediately called him, and I went through the history here, and I said, look, the only people that would have the capability to do this were someone, people, working for U.S.
[02:16:42.510 --> 02:16:45.292]  government programs on anthrax,
[02:16:46.429 --> 02:16:57.116]  And with access to probably a biosafety lab three or four, maybe four, given how serious this was, lab.
[02:16:57.156 --> 02:17:03.620]  And I explained to him the reasons for my opinion.
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:08.944]  And I believe he took me seriously because he knew I was an expert in the field.
[02:17:09.704 --> 02:17:15.628]  And, of course, people had been killed, and Congress was shut down.
[02:17:16.536 --> 02:17:19.018]  Which, in my opinion, is a political crime.
[02:17:20.419 --> 02:17:31.667]  After I hung up, I then realized that I had a list of all of the biological warfare contracts, all the contractors, and all the labs, and all the names.
[02:17:32.387 --> 02:17:32.747]  Stay there.
[02:17:32.787 --> 02:17:33.428]  We've got a break.
[02:17:34.268 --> 02:17:34.909]  We've got a break.
[02:17:35.009 --> 02:17:41.593]  And then there's also that congressional study that was funded of how to send weaponized anthrax to the mail.
[02:17:42.194 --> 02:17:44.676]  We'll be right back with Dr. Boyle.
[02:17:45.894 --> 02:17:49.815]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:17:50.016 --> 02:18:02.300]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:03.120]  The U.S.
[02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:08.742]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:18:09.163 --> 02:18:11.363]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:18:13.224 --> 02:18:13.704]  We're good to go.
[02:18:34.051 --> 02:18:34.252]  That's 1-800-686-2237

[02:19:49.082 --> 02:19:58.324]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:19:59.244 --> 02:20:05.986]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:20:06.943 --> 02:20:08.404]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:20:08.604 --> 02:20:11.687]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[02:20:45.962 --> 02:20:49.943]  I found this company online, and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:20:50.163 --> 02:20:53.745]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:20:53.985 --> 02:20:58.086]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:20:58.366 --> 02:20:59.306]  I was so amazed.
[02:20:59.546 --> 02:21:02.387]  I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect nightlight.
[02:21:02.567 --> 02:21:04.448]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:21:04.828 --> 02:21:10.030]  SolelyWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:16.412]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:21:16.672 --> 02:21:18.412]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:21:18.653 --> 02:21:21.854]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully, and there was no scent.
[02:21:22.034 --> 02:21:25.935]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:21:26.215 --> 02:21:27.695]  Plus, the service was great.

[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:43.003]  Our headline was U.S.
[02:21:43.023 --> 02:22:01.996]  Government Biological Weapons Legislator says 2001 attacks, anthrax attacks, part of government bio-warfare program.
[02:22:03.087 --> 02:22:09.630]  Expert says FBI covered up the plot to attack Congress, which may have been perpetrated by the same people who carried out 9-11.
[02:22:10.490 --> 02:22:19.315]  And so, you know, he's literally written our biological weapons treaty, written other, you know, serious laws that were then, I guess, coupled with treaties, would be more exact.
[02:22:20.495 --> 02:22:28.699]  And clearly, I mean, we were saying super weaponized, because I just went up and looked when the attacks were happening at the basic public stuff available.
[02:22:29.500 --> 02:22:36.627]  And that, you know, only super weaponized anthrax would be having these type of, you know, effects when it gets on your skin, you get it.
[02:22:37.088 --> 02:22:43.054]  I mean, normally you'd have to breathe, you know, the classical anthrax out of some barnyard and then it wouldn't still have those numbers of kills.
[02:22:43.929 --> 02:22:47.052]  But then the FBI said, no, somebody with a bucket can make this.
[02:22:47.112 --> 02:22:48.153]  This is low-tech.
[02:22:48.593 --> 02:22:52.596]  But let's go back to our guest and walk through this for everyone.
[02:22:52.616 --> 02:22:59.341]  And then the White House on Cipro, and just it goes on and on, and they make money off the drug that supposedly treats it.
[02:22:59.602 --> 02:23:01.283]  Please continue, Dr. Boyle.
[02:23:01.883 --> 02:23:02.044]  Right.
[02:23:02.124 --> 02:23:11.331]  So I was having the conversation with Marianne Spike Bowman, the very high-level official in the FBI dealing with terrorism and counterterrorism, and I
[02:23:11.909 --> 02:23:24.934]  After the first conversation where I explained to him who was behind this, it then occurred to me that I had a complete listing of all contractors doing anthrax work for the Pentagon.
[02:23:25.494 --> 02:23:27.335]  And I have that book here in front of me.
[02:23:27.435 --> 02:23:33.437]  It's called Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, Biological Defense Research Program, April 1989.
[02:23:35.310 --> 02:23:42.872]  So I called him back, and I said, look, I have the names and the labs right here of everyone involved in anthrax work for the government.
[02:23:43.573 --> 02:23:48.214]  And I went through all the names, the contracts, and the labs for anthrax work.
[02:23:48.314 --> 02:24:00.778]  And I said, now, obviously, it's been updated because the Clinton administration began to get heavily back into bio-warfare, but I'm sure you could get the most recent contracts from the Pentagon
[02:24:01.551 --> 02:24:17.477]  And then we also know, this is what I told Bowman, that the CIA is back in biowarfare research and specifically on anthrax because that book by Miller and Broad from the New York Times had just come out that previous summer.
[02:24:18.257 --> 02:24:25.120]  So Bowman told me that, well, the FBI was working with Fort Detrick on this matter and was coordinating with them.
[02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:27.261]  And I specifically said,
[02:24:27.853 --> 02:24:31.496]  Look, Fort Detrick could really be the problem here.
[02:24:31.756 --> 02:24:33.578]  And it turns out that's exactly who.
[02:24:33.918 --> 02:24:36.340]  We're working with the Fox in the henhouse very closely.
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:37.281]  He's advising us.
[02:24:37.921 --> 02:24:38.121]  Right.
[02:24:38.302 --> 02:24:44.947]  So I said, you know, you could have a situation where someone who was on the reservation is off the reservation.
[02:24:45.467 --> 02:24:48.510]  So he said, well, he passed this along to the appropriate people.
[02:24:48.530 --> 02:24:53.574]  So at first you're thinking it's somebody rogue in the government, but then you start seeing an overall pattern of a cover-up.
[02:24:54.295 --> 02:24:55.255]  Well, what happened then...
[02:24:56.699 --> 02:25:11.852]  Soon after I had informed Bowman of this information, the FBI authorized the destruction of the Ames Anthrax Culture Database in Ames, Iowa.
[02:25:12.292 --> 02:25:17.537]  That way you can't find out which strain was sent to who to find out who developed the larger breed of it.
[02:25:18.177 --> 02:25:18.938]  That's correct.
[02:25:19.078 --> 02:25:20.079]  And clearly...
[02:25:20.737 --> 02:25:31.082]  For the FBI to have authorized the destruction of the Ames Anthrax collection, that was obstruction of justice, a federal crime.
[02:25:32.003 --> 02:25:39.026]  That collection should have been preserved and protected as evidence.
[02:25:39.146 --> 02:25:40.387]  That's like fingerprints.
[02:25:40.447 --> 02:25:41.187]  Explain that, Doctor.
[02:25:41.207 --> 02:25:42.168]  I mean, that's the fingerprints.
[02:25:42.828 --> 02:25:43.268]  Right.
[02:25:43.348 --> 02:25:46.910]  That's the DNA fingerprints right there.
[02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:57.391]  It later came out, of course, that this was in-strain anthrax that was behind the Daschle and Leahy letter.
[02:25:57.411 --> 02:26:01.292]  Yeah, so it later comes out that they're... I mean, that's key.
[02:26:01.772 --> 02:26:06.473]  It later comes out they're destroying the exact strain from the exact place.
[02:26:06.553 --> 02:26:07.653]  Oh, but it's all an accident.
[02:26:07.773 --> 02:26:11.114]  Well, it's not just the strain, but this is where it originated.
[02:26:11.573 --> 02:26:16.035]  That the whole collection was out there at Ames, and that's why it was called Ames.
[02:26:16.175 --> 02:26:16.676]  Sure, sure.
[02:26:16.716 --> 02:26:18.217]  So everything gets destroyed.
[02:26:18.937 --> 02:26:25.781]  So you really, you know, if you're, I was originally hired here to teach criminal law, which I taught for a number of years.
[02:26:25.841 --> 02:26:27.862]  I still do criminal defense work.
[02:26:27.942 --> 02:26:28.422]  It's simple.
[02:26:28.442 --> 02:26:34.185]  In the middle of a massive criminal investigation, they go right to the key source of evidence to catch who did it, and they destroy it.
[02:26:34.405 --> 02:26:34.985]  They destroy it.
[02:26:35.266 --> 02:26:35.486]  Right.
[02:26:36.026 --> 02:26:37.627]  And so at that point,
[02:26:38.490 --> 02:26:45.413]  It was very clear to me that what we were dealing with here was a cover-up by the FBI.
[02:26:45.593 --> 02:27:00.380]  And later on in my reading the Griffiths book on 9-11, it turns out that Griffiths pointed out that Bowman was the same FBI agent
[02:27:01.013 --> 02:27:05.876]  Who sabotaged the FISA warrant for the Musawi computer.
[02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:08.018]  I was unaware of it at that time.
[02:27:08.498 --> 02:27:10.499]  So you didn't know you were talking to the devil?
[02:27:11.660 --> 02:27:24.568]  I wouldn't say it was the devil, but I didn't realize he was the guy who had sabotaged the warrant for the FISA warrant for Musawi's computer that could have prevented the terrible tragedies of September 11th.
[02:27:25.369 --> 02:27:26.069]  You're right, Doctor.
[02:27:26.109 --> 02:27:26.990]  You weren't talking to the devil.
[02:27:27.010 --> 02:27:28.451]  You were talking to one of his top generals.
[02:27:28.491 --> 02:27:29.291]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:29.692 --> 02:27:30.152]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.928 --> 02:27:36.889]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.329 --> 02:27:38.931]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.851 --> 02:27:42.594]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.016 --> 02:27:47.618]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:27:47.938 --> 02:27:56.545]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:27:56.885 --> 02:28:02.610]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:28:03.010 --> 02:28:10.435]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[02:28:10.775 --> 02:28:16.138]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.

[02:28:46.169 --> 02:28:46.829]  Terrorism.
[02:28:47.029 --> 02:28:47.750]  Terrorism.
[02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:48.710]  Chemical attacks.
[02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:49.450]  Dirty bombs.
[02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:49.970]  Fallout.
[02:28:50.050 --> 02:28:51.051]  Biological attack.
[02:28:51.231 --> 02:28:51.751]  Anthrax.
[02:28:51.831 --> 02:28:53.932]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:28:54.192 --> 02:28:55.792]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:28:56.032 --> 02:28:58.493]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:28:58.893 --> 02:29:13.458]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:29:13.498 --> 02:29:13.818]  government.
[02:29:13.998 --> 02:29:15.779]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:29:16.179 --> 02:29:22.080]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:26.701]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[02:29:45.529 --> 02:29:49.592]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:49.792 --> 02:29:53.174]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:53.375 --> 02:29:56.817]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.105 --> 02:30:00.347]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:00.367 --> 02:30:05.850]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:15.515]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:15.635 --> 02:30:16.916]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:16.956 --> 02:30:22.419]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:22.905 --> 02:30:27.347]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:27.367 --> 02:30:28.808]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[02:30:47.053 --> 02:30:52.197]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:55.279]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:56.940 --> 02:30:59.382]  Let me just throw something out here concerning the anthrax.
[02:31:01.183 --> 02:31:11.111]  We reported here from sources in Washington that the White House, much of the cabinet, and Bush's employees, staff, were on Cipro, the anthrax-fighting antibiotic.
[02:31:12.151 --> 02:31:12.912]  Ari Fleischer said,
[02:31:13.823 --> 02:31:22.126]  In a press conference, months after, did admit that indeed the President and much of his cabinet were on Cipro on September 11th.
[02:31:23.187 --> 02:31:39.013]  That is three plus weeks before anthrax popped up in Boca Raton, Florida at American Media, the place where they'd written the story and gotten the photos of the drunk Bush daughters and reportedly had more, but the archives got seized because they'd been salted with anthrax.
[02:31:39.233 --> 02:31:43.435]  The Fed said, Dashiell and other enemies get it, other enemies in the media get it,
[02:31:44.116 --> 02:31:44.897]  I think we're good to go.
[02:32:10.189 --> 02:32:14.951]  How they now claim that, oh, you can read this in your basement and anybody can do this.
[02:32:15.271 --> 02:32:16.811]  I mean, let's walk through it.
[02:32:17.172 --> 02:32:25.154]  Let's go back to where you were at, Doctor, talking about you discovered that this FBI agent you're talking to is the one involved in other cover-ups.
[02:32:25.194 --> 02:32:25.835]  Please continue.
[02:32:26.395 --> 02:32:26.615]  Right.
[02:32:27.535 --> 02:32:33.637]  The Griffiths books on 9-11, which I take it you probably had him on, David, Professor Griffiths.
[02:32:33.697 --> 02:32:34.378]  Oh, yeah, many times.
[02:32:35.038 --> 02:32:38.179]  And he, as I was reading through his books...
[02:32:38.877 --> 02:33:03.291]  He identified Bowman, the same guy I was dealing with, this very high-level official at the FBI on terrorism and counterterrorism, as the exact same FBI agent in Washington who had sabotaged the FISA warrant request from the office up there in Minneapolis to get access to Mousali's computer.
[02:33:04.131 --> 02:33:07.033]  And if they had access to Mousali's computer...
[02:33:08.285 --> 02:33:12.548]  They very well might have been able to head off September 11th.
[02:33:12.748 --> 02:33:19.532]  Sure, and we have the other agents saying they were told, do not investigate this in Phoenix, in Chicago, in Dallas.
[02:33:19.553 --> 02:33:21.033]  And I've even interviewed some of those agents.
[02:33:21.053 --> 02:33:24.916]  And then after the fact, they were told they'd be arrested if they told the press what they knew.
[02:33:25.276 --> 02:33:32.040]  And FBI agent Robert Wright on national television on C-SPAN said, all I can tell you is the Bushes' vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[02:33:32.321 --> 02:33:32.781]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:33:33.970 --> 02:33:42.337]  So Bowman was the same guy, and as Griffiths pointed out, later on he was promoted and given a decoration.
[02:33:42.697 --> 02:33:55.547]  And as I suggest in my book, I guess he was promoted and given a decoration because he did such a fine job on Mousali's computer and also on the anthrax.
[02:33:56.107 --> 02:33:59.650]  Now, this pattern of behavior repeats itself
[02:34:00.442 --> 02:34:15.066]  As you know, about a year ago, in February, the Bush administration puts up a renewal of the USA Patriot Act, which was expiring in accordance with its terms after five years.
[02:34:15.866 --> 02:34:21.428]  And again, it was being stalled and delayed by Senator Russ Feingold and others in the Senate.
[02:34:22.508 --> 02:34:27.409]  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, censors in the U.S.
[02:34:27.489 --> 02:34:28.970]  Senate House office building
[02:34:30.683 --> 02:34:33.925]  Begin to go off and detect a nerve agent.
[02:34:34.945 --> 02:34:38.427]  And you probably recall this from last year.
[02:34:39.087 --> 02:34:40.308]  But let me stop you there.
[02:34:40.628 --> 02:34:41.808]  Let's go back to what they did.
[02:34:42.088 --> 02:34:50.312]  A lot of Americans and people listening globally will forget what they did with the anthrax attack in October of 2001.
[02:34:51.213 --> 02:34:57.476]  They shut down almost the entire complex, and it was a feeling of hysteria and siege then.
[02:34:58.044 --> 02:35:09.774]  Right, and that is then how they rammed through the USA Patriot Act itself, because the opposition by Senator Leahy and Daschle, whom they tried to kill, disappeared.
[02:35:10.514 --> 02:35:16.999]  And so they rammed it through, and indeed, even the House itself officially shut down.
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:21.843]  I believe probably the first time in the history of this republic.
[02:35:22.184 --> 02:35:23.765]  The Senate refused to shut down.
[02:35:25.168 --> 02:35:32.088]  And basically I say then that this is the greatest political crime ever in the history of this country.
[02:35:33.967 --> 02:35:35.909]  Well, now... Well, I agree.
[02:35:35.949 --> 02:35:37.550]  Now Bush... This is key, though.
[02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:56.721]  Now Bush has been using his executive force over the federal marshals and Capitol Police, and now we've seen on TV... Remember when the backfire happened with a car, and so they thought it was a shooting, and guys running up with guns on national TV telling senators and House members, no, you're not doing an interview on TV outside the Capitol.
[02:35:57.041 --> 02:35:58.202]  Move and move now.
[02:35:58.502 --> 02:36:01.304]  Now these little nobody goons are above our representatives.
[02:36:02.415 --> 02:36:03.118]  Well, that's right.
[02:36:03.238 --> 02:36:07.054]  And again, what happened, the same pattern of behavior...
[02:36:07.717 --> 02:36:11.918]  Came up with the renewal of the USA Patriot Act in February 2006.
[02:36:12.118 --> 02:36:27.563]  Well, that's my point, is we see executive sharks circling the legislative now, claiming this authority, while meanwhile, in the Military Authorization Act of 2007, in the Military Commissions Act, we also see them claiming a dictatorial power.
[02:36:27.603 --> 02:36:33.645]  So we see them exercising it with signing statements, executive orders, exercising it physically with federal forces,
[02:36:34.145 --> 02:36:47.771]  Well, that's right, and I point that out in Biowarfare and Terrorism and also in my previous book last year, Destroying World Order.
[02:36:48.151 --> 02:37:02.917]  And remember, in that first USA Patriot Act, already sitting on Ashcroft's desk before September 11th, and you know before September 11th, Ashcroft was flying around in a private jet because he was told there was going to be a terrorist attack with airplanes.
[02:37:03.974 --> 02:37:05.656]  So all this had been planned.
[02:37:06.196 --> 02:37:15.287]  And they were going to move to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, which is all that really separates us from a police state.
[02:37:15.908 --> 02:37:17.991]  And that is what they have done now.
[02:37:18.729 --> 02:37:21.670]  With respect to enemy combatants.
[02:37:21.690 --> 02:37:22.591]  6166, yeah.
[02:37:22.931 --> 02:37:26.452]  And that is also, of course, what they did to two U.S.
[02:37:26.492 --> 02:37:30.994]  citizens, Mr. Padilla and also Mr. Hamdi.
[02:37:31.114 --> 02:37:33.955]  They just rounded them up and threw them in military brigs.
[02:37:35.036 --> 02:37:38.618]  Despite the common law and statutory right of habeas corpus.
[02:37:39.419 --> 02:37:51.068]  Now let's be clear on the trick they play, and you're a leading lawyer and legal expert on many facets, but a lot of law professors and others, but I read it day one when it passed, even before the LA Times made its pronouncement.
[02:37:51.688 --> 02:37:55.551]  Well, in the second USA Patriot Act, they did have a provision in there, yes, you are correct,
[02:38:21.201 --> 02:38:23.223]  Now, someone was able to knock that out of the...
[02:38:49.641 --> 02:38:51.222]  USA Patriot Act 2.
[02:38:51.623 --> 02:38:54.825]  But in some of the White House memos, they're arguing that power.
[02:38:54.865 --> 02:38:56.206]  That is correct.
[02:38:56.346 --> 02:39:10.076]  The Federalist Society lawyers, of which Din is a member, are arguing that the 14th Amendment does not really mean what it says it says, and therefore they can strip us of our U.S.
[02:39:10.096 --> 02:39:10.656]  citizenship.
[02:39:11.207 --> 02:39:17.929]  And Professor Yu at Berkeley, who is a war criminal on the faculty there, has argued the exact same point.
[02:39:18.049 --> 02:39:19.429]  Let me ask you a question, Doctor.
[02:39:19.469 --> 02:39:23.990]  So you do have these, Alex, you're correct, these memoranda are there.
[02:39:24.210 --> 02:39:35.013]  And indeed, we also have members of the Bush administration who have publicly stated that Korematsu is still good law by the Supreme Court, which is technically correct.
[02:39:35.093 --> 02:39:36.473]  It's never been overturned.
[02:39:36.933 --> 02:39:39.314]  So, in other words, they're taking the position
[02:39:40.017 --> 02:39:57.216]  That at some point in time, if they want to, they can unilaterally round up United States native-born citizens, as they did for Japanese Americans in World War II, and stick us into concentration camps.
[02:39:57.817 --> 02:39:58.458]  That's correct.
[02:39:59.018 --> 02:39:59.199]  Now...
[02:40:00.087 --> 02:40:06.092]  They haven't yet done it, but my guess is the papers have been drawn up.
[02:40:07.053 --> 02:40:12.477]  This actually was revealed by the Nation magazine when Meese was Attorney General.
[02:40:13.077 --> 02:40:16.640]  And Meese was the guy who gave many of these people their first job.
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:18.702]  Yeah, that's Rex 84.
[02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:19.262]  That's Rex 84.
[02:40:19.742 --> 02:40:20.463]  Right.
[02:40:20.763 --> 02:40:24.146]  And those plans were already drawn up back then.
[02:40:24.686 --> 02:40:26.908]  And we know the FEMA camps are out there.
[02:40:27.449 --> 02:40:39.175]  So it's clear the Bush people, I guess they're waiting for some other terrorist attack, another anthrax attack, who knows what, and then they will proceed to invoke these emergency orders.
[02:40:39.235 --> 02:40:39.455]  Right.
[02:40:39.736 --> 02:40:41.457]  And then we will proceed to kick their butt.
[02:40:41.797 --> 02:40:43.958]  Now, let me go back here.
[02:40:45.013 --> 02:40:47.615]  To John Yoo, you mentioned.
[02:40:47.635 --> 02:41:01.344]  This guy, because you've worked around these people, you've worked at the highest levels, I'm trying to understand the mindset of Hitler would torture people and have mass murder engaged in, and prosecute genocide, but he wasn't public about it.
[02:41:02.364 --> 02:41:10.670]  We look at John Yoo, I guess adding an addendum to the Gonzalez torture memo saying we can squeeze children's
[02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:14.082]  Parts, sexual organs with pliers.
[02:41:14.623 --> 02:41:15.924]  We can do it in front of their parents.
[02:41:15.984 --> 02:41:20.608]  And then Professor Castle in Chicago at a CFR meeting brings this up.
[02:41:20.829 --> 02:41:21.569]  We played the tape.
[02:41:21.609 --> 02:41:22.170]  He recorded it.
[02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.590]  Right.
[02:41:23.011 --> 02:41:28.576]  And this is a CFR member thinking that this is such a violation of everything that he's going to break the rules and record it.
[02:41:28.896 --> 02:41:31.018]  And John Yoo goes, yeah, the president has that power.
[02:41:31.158 --> 02:41:33.740]  No, you murdering piece of trash.
[02:41:34.301 --> 02:41:35.902]  And by the way, his memos cause murders.
[02:41:35.922 --> 02:41:36.623]  They are murderers.
[02:41:37.404 --> 02:41:38.886]  You know, you pieces of filth.
[02:41:39.446 --> 02:41:39.907]  All of you.
[02:41:39.947 --> 02:41:42.330]  You cannot... And they are pieces of filth.
[02:41:42.430 --> 02:41:43.351]  I mean that rhetoric.
[02:41:43.792 --> 02:41:48.658]  They clearly are war criminals, and they should be prosecuted and put in jail.
[02:41:48.798 --> 02:41:50.200]  But that's my question.
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:53.424]  How do they write memos about torturing children sexually?
[02:41:53.625 --> 02:41:55.187]  What is their major malfunction?
[02:41:55.874 --> 02:42:04.657]  Well, in the case of Professor Yu, if I remember correctly, he came originally from a foreign country.
[02:42:04.797 --> 02:42:06.718]  I can't remember if it was South Vietnam.
[02:42:06.758 --> 02:42:08.898]  Yeah, we're going to have a bunch of foreigners, really.
[02:42:09.259 --> 02:42:09.499]  Right.
[02:42:09.939 --> 02:42:11.439]  And the same way with Viet Dinh.
[02:42:11.479 --> 02:42:13.360]  These are not native-born U.S.
[02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:13.880]  citizens.
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:16.241]  They come from totalitarian countries.
[02:42:17.201 --> 02:42:27.347]  And they come over here, and in order to get ahead, they adopt totalitarian practices, and they really don't know the first thing about what American democracy is supposed to be all about.
[02:42:27.867 --> 02:42:35.712]  But those are two of the key people here, Viet Dinh on the Patriot Act 1 and 2, which would have stripped us of our U.S.
[02:42:35.732 --> 02:42:37.673]  citizenship, and they could still try to do it.
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:49.869]  And then you, who is a war criminal and should be prosecuted, as well as Professor Goldsmith at Harvard Law School, where I went to show you how sick the whole system is.
[02:42:50.570 --> 02:43:03.300]  I was told that Harvard Law School was considering hiring Professor Goldsmith, who's a colleague of you and Dent, and was up to his nose in torture, war crimes, disappearances, etc.,
[02:43:04.051 --> 02:43:12.733]  And I made sure the entire faculty knew that this guy was up to his keister in torture, war crimes, disappearances, whatever.
[02:43:13.293 --> 02:43:14.253]  And they hired him anyway.
[02:43:15.093 --> 02:43:19.254]  And the dean of the law school then said how proud she was to have hired this guy.
[02:43:19.994 --> 02:43:28.695]  And when the Washington Post published one of his smoking guns, she repeated that, that she was really proud.
[02:43:29.296 --> 02:43:31.216]  So what we see also...
[02:43:32.208 --> 02:43:37.332]  Is infiltration not just of the legal profession, but of legal education.
[02:43:37.933 --> 02:43:41.756]  And the Nazis did the exact same thing, too.
[02:43:41.916 --> 02:43:47.141]  They had their lawyers infiltrating law schools.
[02:43:48.041 --> 02:43:59.231]  One of the worst of the Nazi jurisprudence, Schmidt, Carl Schmidt, and he was the mentor to Leo Strauss, the founder of the Neoconservatives.
[02:44:00.418 --> 02:44:06.201]  So the same phenomena that started out in Nazi Germany is happening here.
[02:44:06.241 --> 02:44:07.822]  And I exaggerate not.
[02:44:08.022 --> 02:44:20.047]  I have here in front of me the classic work by Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism, where she did the definitive study of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia.
[02:44:20.947 --> 02:44:27.070]  And on page 145 she says, quote, The first essential step
[02:44:27.984 --> 02:44:35.606]  On the road to total domination is to kill the heretical person in man.
[02:44:36.226 --> 02:44:45.449]  That's exactly what this category of enemy combatants developed by you and Goldsmith did and these other federal... You're talking about dehumanization.
[02:44:45.549 --> 02:44:49.430]  First they dehumanize the group, and then they're going to start torturing and exterminating.
[02:44:49.650 --> 02:44:52.931]  Well, they no longer have a legal personality.
[02:44:53.391 --> 02:44:55.232]  This is what the Nazis did to the Jews.
[02:44:55.902 --> 02:45:03.947]  And Professor Ehret, the late Professor Ehret here, wrote the definitive analysis of how they did this and how they got away with it.
[02:45:04.067 --> 02:45:06.388]  And that's what they do with this habeas corpus attack.
[02:45:07.069 --> 02:45:07.549]  That's right.
[02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:17.155]  You mentioned the Military Commissions Act, now applicable to everyone down in Guantanamo or anyone they designate as an unlawful combatant.
[02:45:17.555 --> 02:45:18.415]  That's exactly right.
[02:45:18.515 --> 02:45:24.479]  It strips them of any legal personality whatsoever.
[02:45:24.981 --> 02:45:28.803]  Exactly what the Nazis did to the Jews before exterminating them.
[02:45:28.823 --> 02:45:29.304]  That's right.
[02:45:29.624 --> 02:45:32.306]  And that's what Professor Arendt was commenting on.
[02:45:32.326 --> 02:45:35.588]  It's unbelievable that in the United States they could do something like this.
[02:45:36.008 --> 02:45:38.550]  The good news is there is a huge backlash against them.
[02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:45.494]  80 plus percent of Americans in almost every poll you look at, it could be 80, 84, 86, depending on the scientific poll,
[02:45:46.244 --> 02:45:48.446]  I hate these people, but they don't seem to care.
[02:45:48.466 --> 02:46:01.034]  And now the Democrats have come to power, and it looks like they're just going to gladly take the new powers, the unlawful powers that have been, quote, given to the presidency, and just continue running with it, Professor.
[02:46:01.074 --> 02:46:01.354]  Doctor?
[02:46:01.374 --> 02:46:03.196]  I think that's correct.
[02:46:03.296 --> 02:46:06.538]  And I'm a political independent myself.
[02:46:06.658 --> 02:46:07.498]  I always have been.
[02:46:07.598 --> 02:46:10.801]  But it looks like the Democrats are just going to roll over and play dead.
[02:46:11.221 --> 02:46:14.203]  And so I guess we're talking about
[02:46:14.983 --> 02:46:20.858]  More organizing, third parties, more opposition, protests, demonstrations.
[02:46:20.878 --> 02:46:21.860]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:46:23.476 --> 02:46:24.397]  Where do you see it going?
[02:46:24.537 --> 02:46:43.212]  Why are the big defense contractors and the big banks that own this country, why do they, because they clearly made a decision pre-9-11, and of course the evidence is they orchestrated it and provocateured it, why have they made the conscious decision, because they already owned everything and had all this power, why have they made the decision to turn us into such a police state?
[02:46:43.252 --> 02:46:44.773]  Is it because they're blowing out the dollar?
[02:46:45.153 --> 02:46:48.796]  They need to fully seize us as an engine of global domination and imperialism?
[02:46:49.217 --> 02:46:51.999]  I mean, why are they really trying to forge us into the Fourth Reich?
[02:46:53.294 --> 02:46:56.276]  Well, again, it's both at the same time.
[02:46:56.416 --> 02:47:20.554]  When they decided to start the wars against Afghanistan and Iraq for the purpose of controlling and dominating three-quarters of the world's energy supplies, they realized full well there would be an enormous backlash among the American people to such an act of hegemonial imperialism.
[02:47:21.178 --> 02:47:23.240]  Well, that's what I try to tell the good old boys.
[02:47:41.897 --> 02:47:45.739]  Who drive around in their cars, and they've called in here, I heard on other shows, well, we need that oil.
[02:47:45.759 --> 02:47:46.520]  Yeah, so what?
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:47.980]  Let's just kill all them Arabs.
[02:47:48.060 --> 02:47:48.781]  I go, wait a minute.
[02:47:49.301 --> 02:47:51.422]  Let's just say you're cold-blooded, you have that attitude.
[02:47:52.002 --> 02:47:56.705]  They have the view that they're somehow in the predator's cockpit, and that they're going to get something out of this.
[02:47:56.745 --> 02:48:11.293]  I want to explain to them that if an Iraqi child's life is worthless to this elite, you're worthless, your bank account is worthless, and this very same tyranny we're thrusting on others is going to come back home seven times seven,
[02:48:11.994 --> 02:48:13.896]  And that what comes around goes around.
[02:48:13.957 --> 02:48:15.058]  You reap what you sow.
[02:48:15.399 --> 02:48:17.121]  I mean, don't they understand that, Doctor?
[02:48:17.742 --> 02:48:19.705]  Well, look what happened to Mr. Padilla.
[02:48:19.725 --> 02:48:22.490]  He was tortured, a U.S.
[02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:25.855]  citizen, in a military brig there in South Carolina.
[02:48:26.403 --> 02:48:29.546]  So that's what faces us all in the future.
[02:48:29.646 --> 02:48:29.886]  Right.
[02:48:29.966 --> 02:48:37.373]  And they've tried very hard to extend that enemy combatant determination in the future to any United States citizen.
[02:48:37.834 --> 02:48:39.295]  So sure, we could all be tortured.
[02:48:39.675 --> 02:48:39.875]  Right.
[02:48:39.955 --> 02:48:42.538]  We could all be treated this way.
[02:48:42.798 --> 02:48:43.459]  Stay there.
[02:48:43.499 --> 02:48:44.079]  Final segment.
[02:48:44.119 --> 02:48:44.780]  Final segment, Doctor.
[02:48:49.088 --> 02:48:52.149]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.529 --> 02:48:54.449]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.849 --> 02:49:02.511]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.191 --> 02:49:10.252]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.633 --> 02:49:13.573]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.953 --> 02:49:16.274]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.694 --> 02:49:17.514]  NSA spies.

[02:49:46.048 --> 02:49:46.288]  I think.
[02:50:06.909 --> 02:50:13.754]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:13.814 --> 02:50:16.135]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:50:45.615 --> 02:50:53.537]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:50:54.017 --> 02:50:57.178]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[02:50:57.558 --> 02:51:00.598]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.
[02:51:00.978 --> 02:51:05.799]  Just visit HerbalHealer.com and shop online or request a free catalog.
[02:51:06.239 --> 02:51:08.560]  You're bound to find the alternative you're looking for.
[02:51:09.326 --> 02:51:13.987]  Did you know that Herbal Healer carries the latest, safest and effective weight loss products?
[02:51:14.507 --> 02:51:20.369]  You can also count on Herbal Healer for the largest selection of safe and natural supplements just for children.
[02:51:20.689 --> 02:51:21.829]  And don't forget your pets.
[02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:27.971]  Herbal Healer even has natural mineral supplements for all your animals, including horses, cows and birds.
[02:51:28.507 --> 02:51:30.008]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:55.277 --> 02:51:56.338]  Final segment here.
[02:51:56.358 --> 02:52:01.020]  We've got to get Dr. Boyle back up with us because we both want to warn the people.
[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:04.881]  We're both desperate to warn you about the systematic tyranny that's upon us.
[02:52:05.822 --> 02:52:10.184]  Doctor, going back to the anthrax case, you're going public.
[02:52:10.204 --> 02:52:11.244]  You've written a book about this.
[02:52:11.324 --> 02:52:12.525]  Clearly it's an inside job.
[02:52:12.565 --> 02:52:13.345]  Clearly a cover-up.
[02:52:15.586 --> 02:52:17.547]  Will anybody ever be brought to justice?
[02:52:17.687 --> 02:52:24.370]  I mean, how much more obvious is it with the White House on Cipro three weeks before it even shows up in the news that anthrax has been mailed?
[02:52:24.430 --> 02:52:24.610]  I mean...
[02:52:26.093 --> 02:52:29.454]  I think we have to keep the pressure on Senator Leahy.
[02:52:30.415 --> 02:52:39.978]  He will, apparently becoming the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will have subpoena power and investigative power, and they did try to kill him.
[02:52:40.938 --> 02:52:47.980]  So if anyone would have motivation to try to get to the bottom of this, it would be Senator Leahy.
[02:52:48.461 --> 02:52:52.582]  But to give your listeners an idea of the police state tactics going on here,
[02:52:54.089 --> 02:53:16.125]  In the summer of 2004, an FBI agent and an agent with the CIA-FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force in Springfield showed up at my office and proceeded to interrogate me for one hour and tried to get me to become an informant on my Arab and Muslim clients.
[02:53:16.792 --> 02:53:17.973]  Which I refused to do.
[02:53:18.073 --> 02:53:20.976]  As I told them, I said, hey, I'm a lawyer and a law professor.
[02:53:21.076 --> 02:53:23.478]  I'm not going to become an informant for the FBI.
[02:53:24.278 --> 02:53:26.220]  Well, that would violate your oath.
[02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:29.503]  Of course, and my client's constitutional rights.
[02:53:30.223 --> 02:53:35.047]  Whereupon, they put me on all of the government's terrorist watch lists.
[02:53:35.227 --> 02:53:36.348]  There are four or five of them.
[02:53:37.449 --> 02:53:41.653]  To give an example of what that means, a year ago, I was lecturing in...
[02:53:42.532 --> 02:53:58.201]  Malaysia, I was flying back into the country, Chicago, O'Hare, and as I landed, there were two armed customs agents standing right on the jet port inspecting passports.
[02:53:58.721 --> 02:54:03.524]  And when I gave them my passport, they took me into custody.
[02:54:04.804 --> 02:54:06.305]  And that's that.
[02:54:06.805 --> 02:54:09.547]  I've been interrogated coming back into the country.
[02:54:10.977 --> 02:54:14.540]  I can't just get a boarding pass.
[02:54:15.541 --> 02:54:22.187]  What do you do, though, when it's some sniveling person, I'm not being mean here, with a GED on a power trip poking at you?
[02:54:22.207 --> 02:54:23.128]  Because it happens to me, too.
[02:54:23.188 --> 02:54:23.748]  I'm on the list.
[02:54:24.409 --> 02:54:26.070]  I mean, I get so tired.
[02:54:26.431 --> 02:54:28.873]  I'm like, your country's gone, you pathetic worm.
[02:54:29.173 --> 02:54:31.575]  Don't you understand the terrorists run the government?
[02:54:31.615 --> 02:54:35.659]  They did the attacks so they could train the American people how to be slaves?
[02:54:36.641 --> 02:54:37.962]  Well, I think that's the point.
[02:54:38.002 --> 02:54:54.459]  You see, over the last 30 years of being a lawyer and a law professor, I've flown into many communist countries, dictatorial countries, etc., etc., and the truth is, none of them are as bad in mistreating me as my own country.
[02:54:54.519 --> 02:54:55.780]  That's right.
[02:54:56.281 --> 02:55:00.105]  Even Cuba wasn't this bad when I went down to Cuba 20 years ago.
[02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:03.801]  Or the Soviet Union, or Libya, or a lot of these other countries.
[02:55:04.181 --> 02:55:04.482]  I know.
[02:55:04.742 --> 02:55:06.342]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[02:55:08.043 --> 02:55:09.603]  So that's what we're facing.
[02:55:10.064 --> 02:55:11.104]  So that's what they did to me.
[02:55:11.944 --> 02:55:13.745]  Doctor, we're out of time.
[02:55:13.825 --> 02:55:15.946]  In closing, 9-11, quickly.
[02:55:16.246 --> 02:55:17.827]  You don't buy that official story, do you?
[02:55:18.427 --> 02:55:19.287]  No, of course not.
[02:55:19.527 --> 02:55:20.147]  It's clear.
[02:55:21.388 --> 02:55:29.331]  Bush, Rice, Tenet, Ashcroft, they all knew a terrorist attack was coming, and they let it happen.
[02:55:30.473 --> 02:55:34.778]  And they let it happen because they wanted a war and they wanted a police state.
[02:55:35.418 --> 02:55:39.743]  All the elements for a war against Afghanistan were there in place.
[02:55:39.944 --> 02:55:43.608]  Even the military forces in the Gulf were there on the scene.
[02:55:43.628 --> 02:55:50.516]  There were massive military forces in the Gulf, in the Atlantic, in the Mediterranean, in the Arabian Ocean.
[02:55:51.061 --> 02:55:59.164]  Before September 11th, poised for an attack, whether it was going to be Afghanistan or Iraq, would be decided by Bush and the rest of them.
[02:55:59.424 --> 02:56:00.064]  We're out of time.
[02:56:00.104 --> 02:56:04.486]  But all this was planned and prepared well before September 11th.
[02:56:04.506 --> 02:56:09.208]  The war plan against Afghanistan goes back to at least 1998.
[02:56:09.288 --> 02:56:10.628]  And so was the Patriot Act.
[02:56:11.129 --> 02:56:12.149]  So was the Patriot Act.
[02:56:12.429 --> 02:56:14.910]  I've got to get you back up for longer in the near future.
[02:56:14.930 --> 02:56:16.971]  We're talking about your new book, Biowarfare and Terrorism.
[02:56:17.891 --> 02:56:19.712]  I really want to thank you, Doctor, for coming on.
[02:56:19.772 --> 02:56:20.252]  Godspeed.
[02:56:20.914 --> 02:56:24.276]  Well, thank you and my best to everyone in your listening audiences.
[02:56:24.296 --> 02:56:24.797]  Let's go.
