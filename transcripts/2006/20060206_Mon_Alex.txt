[00:00:05.968 --> 00:00:06.628]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:08.349]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.150]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:11.631]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:13.292]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:17.654]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:22.216]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:37.385]  Brand new week spanning out before us.
[00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:40.188]  It is the sixth day of February, 2006.
[00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.632]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:51.857]  We only have one guest joining us today because I want to have time to cover a lot of news and take your phone calls.
[00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:55.460]  And our guest joins us in about 30 minutes.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.421]  We'll tell you about her a little bit later.
[00:00:57.902 --> 00:01:00.323]  But it has to do with free speech.
[00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:00.804]  In fact...
[00:01:01.784 --> 00:01:08.847]  I don't try to have themes to particular shows, but the theme of free speech is going to come up over and over again today.
[00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:21.653]  You know, a lot of you have heard of Ernst Zundel, and then of course there's David Irving, both of them alternative historians, and they think that less than 6 million Jews were killed by Hitler.
[00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:29.217]  Now whether you think 10 million Jews were killed or no Jews were killed, it's your right to believe that in a free society.
[00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:32.675]  But not with the laws they have in Europe.
[00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:38.176]  And now even a lot of liberals are coming out and saying, you know, we're living in a police state.
[00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:41.457]  Why are you arresting all of these people for their views?
[00:01:41.517 --> 00:01:48.399]  But notice the government then leaves the toothless, flat-out white supremacist alone to run around hailing Hitler.
[00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.960]  It's these particular historians that they're targeting.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.501]  They're also going after many other classes of individuals for their political speech.
[00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:01.353]  So I wanted to kind of review some of that today.
[00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:14.541]  And it ties in to what's happened over in Europe with the publishing of the artist renderings in cartoon fashion of the Prophet Muhammad.
[00:02:16.262 --> 00:02:18.383]  Now, I believe in free speech.
[00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:22.045]  And I criticize the New World Order when it tries to restrict our free speech.
[00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:26.008]  And I'm going to right now criticize the...
[00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:29.597]  Muslims that are running around burning things.
[00:02:30.677 --> 00:02:36.259]  And as firmly as I can, I'm going to rebuke what's happening.
[00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.021]  But as usual, there's news behind the news, a story behind the story.
[00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:47.904]  We can conclusively prove that this was provocateur-ed, i.e.
[00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:49.984]  mockingbird-ed.
[00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:51.245]  Mockingbird-ed.
[00:02:52.057 --> 00:02:53.718]  They do this all the time.
[00:02:53.818 --> 00:03:00.062]  They go have a few people stir it up, stage it, stage a few rallies, and then a better term than mockingbird is...
[00:03:01.443 --> 00:03:05.426]  Or mocking birding would be snowballing.
[00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:08.369]  You start the little pebble bouncing down the cliff.
[00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:18.598]  If you've ever been in the mountains in an area that has a lot of rock slides and you're up on the side of a hill, you can just throw a little rock off the side and then watch a big pile of rubble slide down the hill.
[00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:25.143]  That's what provocateuring and co-intelproing is all about.
[00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:29.587]  So we'll give you the real take on what's happening with the situations in Europe.
[00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:38.062]  But I believe in free speech, so we're going to be posting up on PrisonPlanet.com the photo or the artist rendering of Muhammad.
[00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:41.164]  And if somebody wants to take a pot shot of me, they can go ahead.
[00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:44.686]  Because I believe in the First Amendment.
[00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:49.108]  And when George Bush tries to annihilate it, I stand up against him.
[00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:57.073]  And when some Muslim Brotherhood individual goes around threatening people, well, you just threatened the wrong person.
[00:03:57.953 --> 00:03:59.374]  You just threatened the wrong country.
[00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:03.714]  And again, I'm not jumping in on some bandwagon and frothing at the Muslims.
[00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:05.075]  I know this was staged.
[00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:09.098]  We have it proven here, as usual, in spades, in triplicate.
[00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:17.704]  But there are a lot of camp followers who got caught up in the snowball, caught up in the rock slide, who are acting like mockingbirds, repeating what they heard.
[00:04:18.204 --> 00:04:19.966]  Polly want a cracker, Polly want a cracker.
[00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:21.747]  And I'm not going to put up with it.
[00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:23.588]  So you're going to get a good rebuking today.
[00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:26.631]  Because we're equal opportunity offenders.
[00:04:28.283 --> 00:04:30.364]  Well, there's a lot of audio clips today.
[00:04:30.384 --> 00:04:33.946]  I have an audio clip of the new movie trailer for a film I can't wait to see.
[00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:36.887]  It's gotten great reviews, but at some levels it looks like a whitewash.
[00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:39.508]  And that's why we fight.
[00:04:39.928 --> 00:04:47.912]  And I have a new Oberman Countdown report where he talks about Bush and Blair wanting to stage a provocation, a problem reaction solution to go to war with Iraq.
[00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:52.314]  And then there's another clip here about retina scanning at public schools.
[00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:54.432]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:54.613 --> 00:04:56.338]  Massive broadcast today.
[00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.887]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:05.699]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.540]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:12.545]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:17.329]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.954]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:24.997]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:27.579]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:28.140]  We're good.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.143]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:02.378 --> 00:06:03.979]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.241]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.243]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:11.323 --> 00:06:18.026]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:21.228]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:23.810]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:34.098]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:06:34.558 --> 00:06:36.779]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:03.379]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:07.664]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:07:08.065 --> 00:07:11.589]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.514]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:20.781]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:26.884]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:07:27.204 --> 00:07:33.347]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:39.430]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.051]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:07:41.372 --> 00:07:42.493]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:42.573 --> 00:07:47.999]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the tests found on TriVortex.com.
[00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:51.662]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:53.244]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:53.564]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:08:02.757 --> 00:08:08.780]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.442]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.082 --> 00:08:24.327]  All right, a lot of First Amendment free speech news from the U.S., Europe, and worldwide coming up from really three or four different perspectives.
[00:08:25.428 --> 00:08:32.231]  What the Muslims are up to, what Western governments are doing, what's happening here in the United States.
[00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:36.038]  You know, I tend to glaze over a lot of news.
[00:08:36.098 --> 00:08:40.508]  I was listening to the Genesis Network earlier today getting ready for my own broadcast.
[00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.833]  I was listening to the previous show.
[00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:50.980]  And the host, God bless him, was actually reading the new sections of the Patriot Act.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.462]  See, Bush just doesn't want the old one authorized.
[00:08:53.782 --> 00:08:56.644]  He always says, pass it again and strengthen it.
[00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:58.825]  And I read this two weeks ago.
[00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:00.066]  I mentioned it on air.
[00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:03.389]  But I should do an entire three-hour broadcast on it.
[00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:06.351]  But what do you do when there's just hundreds of things every day to talk about?
[00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:08.832]  And it clearly does say in there.
[00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:11.214]  I was just reminded by the host who was reading it, Gary Brownfield,
[00:09:13.243 --> 00:09:17.848]  That it actually says disturbance, any disturbance of the peace.
[00:09:17.888 --> 00:09:24.174]  That can be an anti-war sign, an anti-abortion sign, whatever the case may be.
[00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:34.205]  Whatever it is, it doesn't matter, left, right, conservative, libertarian, Christian, socialist, animist, whatever it is, Muslim.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.721]  It doesn't matter.
[00:09:37.341 --> 00:09:42.144]  They can give you, starting off, a year in prison.
[00:09:42.185 --> 00:09:48.449]  And then they claim that if you resist in any way, ten years in prison and there's tens of thousands of dollars of fines.
[00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:52.151]  He was actually reading the bill, and it just said a disturbance.
[00:09:53.312 --> 00:10:00.297]  And then he was reading examples, and of course, hearing these examples just reminded me of somebody with an anti-war shirt on.
[00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:08.998]  At a mall or the Secret Service goes into these town hall meeting parking lots and watches everyone that pulls in.
[00:10:09.018 --> 00:10:19.250]  And if you have an anti-war bumper sticker or even a Democrat bumper sticker, they then go into these huge town halls that might have 2,000 people in it and they actually arrest you.
[00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.232]  In fact, they don't just kick you out in some cases.
[00:10:21.512 --> 00:10:22.954]  They just go ahead and arrest you.
[00:10:24.685 --> 00:10:25.626]  And there's been video of it.
[00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:31.609]  They just drag you out by your hair and then claim that if you fell down while they were dragging you, that you resisted them.
[00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:34.670]  In fact, we have video on prisonplanet.com of what New York cops do.
[00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.791]  They will run right up on camera.
[00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:38.072]  They don't even care if there's cameras on.
[00:10:38.372 --> 00:10:39.393]  And run into you.
[00:10:39.633 --> 00:10:47.877]  They'll run in, bump their chest into you, and then scream that you've assaulted them and then beat you down and then charge you with felonies.
[00:10:49.935 --> 00:10:51.356]  And there could even be video.
[00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:51.996]  The cops.
[00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:58.339]  One of their favorite things in New York is that the bicycle cops are real good on those bicycles because they ride them every day for years.
[00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:00.320]  And this bicycle cop comes riding up.
[00:11:01.141 --> 00:11:04.682]  He did what I did back when I was like 12 years old on my little huffy dirt bike.
[00:11:05.223 --> 00:11:10.985]  You jump off backwards, pushing yourself off the handlebars, and you throw the bike into the crowd.
[00:11:11.005 --> 00:11:13.707]  There's a crowd marching, a permitted crowd.
[00:11:13.727 --> 00:11:14.867]  You shouldn't even have to have a permit.
[00:11:15.327 --> 00:11:16.168]  And they're marching.
[00:11:17.026 --> 00:11:19.288]  And it says, no police stay on the front of their banner.
[00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:30.535]  And the cop just rides right up on his bicycle in the park, straight towards them, clearly on video, on purpose, launches off his bike, sends it flying into them, and then just starts wailing on people.
[00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:35.318]  And then, of course, there were undercover cops in the crowd, posing as some of the peace activists.
[00:11:35.538 --> 00:11:37.980]  They start wailing on people, choking them.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.182]  I mean, you can just see video of cops setting people up.
[00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:42.343]  We're sick of it!
[00:11:42.643 --> 00:11:43.463]  We're good to go.
[00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:43.643]  I think?
[00:12:05.942 --> 00:12:11.343]  Where the Defense Department is spying on milquetoast groups.
[00:12:11.784 --> 00:12:17.165]  They have what the critical mass bike riders, who weren't even political concerning the war.
[00:12:17.205 --> 00:12:25.107]  They were out there riding for more bike lanes and complaining about bike riders who died for memorials.
[00:12:25.227 --> 00:12:29.308]  Out there with families, little kids on the backs of bikes with their parents.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:30.540]  We're good to go.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.280]  We're good to go.
[00:12:45.746 --> 00:12:46.567]  We're good to go.
[00:13:02.057 --> 00:13:07.704]  Anyone who has pull with the public, even if you serve them, they got a file on you.
[00:13:07.964 --> 00:13:09.126]  They're watching you.
[00:13:09.146 --> 00:13:10.968]  They got dirt on you.
[00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:12.490]  They're crooks.
[00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.272]  They're the dirty mafia.
[00:13:14.512 --> 00:13:17.957]  The government's been taken over by mafia.
[00:13:21.514 --> 00:13:22.935]  I think we're good to go.
[00:13:52.592 --> 00:13:54.874]  Got up and said, I have the quotes right here.
[00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.615]  I could spend an hour on this one article.
[00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:57.355]  See, that's the problem.
[00:13:57.415 --> 00:13:58.716]  It's overload here.
[00:13:59.257 --> 00:13:59.857]  It's overload.
[00:14:00.117 --> 00:14:09.124]  And just says, oh yeah, the president under the Constitution has the authority to do whatever he wants above Congress or any federal judge or anyone else.
[00:14:10.124 --> 00:14:10.745]  Or any law.
[00:14:10.825 --> 00:14:11.905]  He actually says it.
[00:14:11.945 --> 00:14:13.066]  The quotes say that.
[00:14:13.607 --> 00:14:15.308]  It's even worse than what I just paraphrased.
[00:14:16.048 --> 00:14:19.831]  Now, the president swears an oath to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.502]  There are hundreds of federal laws.
[00:14:23.022 --> 00:14:24.784]  When he breaks a law, he's broken a law.
[00:14:24.824 --> 00:14:25.926]  He has to follow the law.
[00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:33.874]  But they know the general public hasn't read the Constitution, so now the twist is the Constitution says we can do whatever we want when it says the opposite.
[00:14:34.394 --> 00:14:36.457]  It's just bald-faced lies.
[00:14:36.517 --> 00:14:43.324]  It's like the head of the NSA last week at the National Press Club out there giving his speech is lying.
[00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:54.112]  He gets up, and as I've since gotten the entire video from C-SPAN, it's even worse than what you saw in Oberman's program, and he says, the Fourth Amendment does not say we need warrants, does not say we need probable cause.
[00:14:54.473 --> 00:14:55.113]  No, it doesn't.
[00:14:55.313 --> 00:14:56.374]  And the reporters are going, yes, it does.
[00:14:56.394 --> 00:14:57.274]  He goes, no, no, it doesn't.
[00:14:59.035 --> 00:15:01.637]  And most people watching that think, well, he doesn't lie.
[00:15:02.518 --> 00:15:03.939]  You know, he just said it with a straight face.
[00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:06.100]  I mean, the straightest face you can imagine.
[00:15:07.797 --> 00:15:08.918]  But you watch these guys.
[00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.279]  Most of them are good at lying, but they still do a tell.
[00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:14.960]  Every time they lie, because I'll watch them.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.941]  When they're not lying, they don't do it.
[00:15:15.961 --> 00:15:19.642]  Every time they lie, there's a certain twitch, or they'll touch their nose.
[00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:20.883]  It's like playing poker.
[00:15:21.223 --> 00:15:22.284]  You learn their tells.
[00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:26.245]  Bill Clinton is one of the only people I know who doesn't do a tell.
[00:15:30.872 --> 00:15:32.413]  Bush just does it constantly.
[00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:37.295]  He does a little gang member smile or that nod and that wink or that thing with his hands out front.
[00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:39.116]  Just not a good liar.
[00:15:39.736 --> 00:15:40.656]  Not a very good liar.
[00:15:40.676 --> 00:15:46.399]  And so basically all he does is twitch and quirk and do little spasms all day long because it's all lies.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.961]  Okay, I've got a guest coming up in 15 minutes and I haven't even covered any of the news yet.
[00:15:53.642 --> 00:15:56.503]  Let's just play the Elberman piece from Countdown.
[00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:03.766]  This is a new piece, not the one where he's exposing the NSA liar, NSA head liar, by just showing the Fourth Amendment on TV.
[00:16:04.266 --> 00:16:11.248]  But this next one is about what we talked about on Thursday and Friday, and now it's been picked up by the Times of London, London Guardian.
[00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:17.770]  Paul Watson and I, along with his brother Steve, I think have written the best articles on it, bar none, at prisonplanet.com.
[00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.031]  So three different stories on that website and on infowars.com covering it in more detail.
[00:16:23.071 --> 00:16:25.752]  But here it is from MSNBC.
[00:16:25.772 --> 00:16:25.992]  Play it.
[00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:34.025]  Intersection of intelligence and politics was a full-on crossroads of the world collision during the lead-up to the war in Iraq.
[00:16:34.465 --> 00:16:48.292]  A potential bombshell of a report in tomorrow's edition of the British newspaper, The Guardian, revealing that weeks before the war began, President Bush told our British allies he intended to invade Iraq even if UN inspectors did not find any evidence of WMD there.
[00:16:48.872 --> 00:16:55.958]  Guardian reporting that there is a British government memo documenting a conversation in which Mr. Bush said exactly that.
[00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:58.240]  Another Downing Street memo.
[00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:06.187]  Ostensibly during a two-hour meeting between the American president and his British counterpart, Prime Minister Blair, on the 31st of January, 2003.
[00:17:07.108 --> 00:17:14.134]  As a result, Mr. Bush apparently telling Mr. Blair that day that, quote, "...the diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning."
[00:17:14.628 --> 00:17:17.911]  The British Prime Minister quoted as saying in return he was solidly with the President.
[00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:31.703]  Also reported that Mr. Bush even proposed to send American planes over Iraq painted in UN colors to try to provoke Saddam Hussein into firing on them in a kind of updated 21st century version of the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:35.909]  Some three years later in this country, it is perhaps not surprising that a U.S.
[00:17:35.969 --> 00:17:42.854]  Senator was today accusing the administration of turning the national intelligence community into a little more than a branch of its PR effort.
[00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:53.543]  The Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing on worldwide terror threats, giving lawmakers their first chance to directly question administration officials about the NSA's domestic spying program.
[00:17:53.803 --> 00:17:58.967]  Democrats outraged that the administration is refusing to provide more details about domestic spying.
[00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:16.837]  I'm deeply troubled by what I see as the administration's continued effort to selectively release intelligence information that supports its policy or political agenda while withholding equally pertinent information that does not do that.
[00:18:17.957 --> 00:18:22.059]  The question I am wrestling with is whether the very independence of the U.S.
[00:18:22.119 --> 00:18:29.481]  Intelligence Committee has been co-opted, to be quite honest about it, by the strong, controlling hand of the White House.
[00:18:30.163 --> 00:18:30.744]  Let me call in.
[00:18:31.324 --> 00:18:31.705]  All right.
[00:18:31.785 --> 00:18:38.872]  So, and by the way, that was John D. Rockefeller, the third or whatever his name is from West Virginia, totally staged.
[00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:52.966]  I mean, running the entire operation, one of the top people in the New World Order, aide-de-camp to David Rockefeller, who's about to totally retire out of the Trilateral Commission and CFR, getting a little bit dotty there.
[00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.024]  And they just do this.
[00:18:55.044 --> 00:19:02.907]  It's like Arlen Specter comes out and says, I think what Bush has done is illegal, but we're going to be talking to Gonzalez this week and then others next week.
[00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:09.750]  Now, what Bush has done may be illegal, and then he adds the caveat, but he may have unlimited power.
[00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.930]  We're going to decide that.
[00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:16.673]  And they've got the leader of the Senate and then his whip also running around.
[00:19:16.753 --> 00:19:22.115]  Frist and his whip are running around, and I have their quotes in the Associated Press, saying...
[00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:25.385]  No, no, Bush can do whatever he wants.
[00:19:26.946 --> 00:19:34.609]  So see, Bill Clinton wasn't bad giving supercomputers and missile secrets to the Chinese, or having convicted cocaine dealers in the White House giving him bribes.
[00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.551]  Well, no, of course he's not above the law, and neither is George Bush.
[00:19:39.592 --> 00:19:40.492]  This is America.
[00:19:40.532 --> 00:19:42.393]  This isn't Nazi Germany or Cuba.
[00:19:43.374 --> 00:19:44.334]  Under Fidel.
[00:19:45.975 --> 00:19:47.616]  It just makes me sick.
[00:19:47.836 --> 00:19:48.176]  And now...
[00:19:48.962 --> 00:19:57.714]  They're going to have a national police force under a huge expanded secret service where there's absolutely no First Amendment anywhere and you go to prison if you speak out.
[00:19:58.515 --> 00:19:59.376]  It actually is in the bill.
[00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:12.766]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:20:12.967 --> 00:20:20.509]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:21.370]  We're good to go.
[00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.633]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:42.575]  The water level is always visible.
[00:20:42.755 --> 00:20:48.700]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.203]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:20:54.204 --> 00:20:55.285]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book.
[00:21:05.743 --> 00:21:06.283]  We're good to go.

[00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.771]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:25.692]  They are instruments of death.
[00:21:25.973 --> 00:21:28.034]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[00:21:28.595 --> 00:21:34.279]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and the genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.

[00:21:51.223 --> 00:21:53.046]  Help steer your own financial ship.

[00:22:02.023 --> 00:22:09.131]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[00:22:09.772 --> 00:22:10.553]  I'm Tex Mars.
[00:22:10.973 --> 00:22:14.237]  My newest book, Codex Magica, is a real eye-opener.
[00:22:14.257 --> 00:22:15.118]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[00:22:19.282 --> 00:22:28.164]  Codex Magica shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:35.926]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati, their mysterious symbols, their hidden language.
[00:22:36.566 --> 00:22:37.427]  Encyclopedia.
[00:22:38.007 --> 00:22:38.627]  Documented.
[00:22:38.907 --> 00:22:42.988]  Codex Magica unmasks a conspiracy of immense evil.
[00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:52.901]  Please, order your personal copy of Codex Magica on the internet at powerofprophecy.com or simply phone toll free 1-800-234-9673.

[00:24:07.902 --> 00:24:15.625]  The federal government in its own policy documents admits that through the schools they're going to take over the entire society.
[00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:21.248]  They're turning the public schools into re-education centers or indoctrination centers.
[00:24:21.268 --> 00:24:24.169]  Coming up in the next segment, iSCAN technology comes to schools.
[00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:26.230]  The federal government's paying for it.
[00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:31.813]  Retina scanning for school lunches, retina scanning for library books, retina scanning for the parents to be able to get into the school.
[00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:33.472]  We're good to go.
[00:24:33.492 --> 00:24:33.893]  We're good to go.
[00:24:57.821 --> 00:25:04.927]  Retina scans and drug dogs searching them and searches in the parking lot and wearing IDs with RFID tracker chips around their necks.
[00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:06.228]  So that's coming up.
[00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:11.693]  And I want to get into what's happening with free speech as well.
[00:25:11.713 --> 00:25:13.214]  Not just here in America, but worldwide.
[00:25:13.254 --> 00:25:14.736]  We have a guest joining us in the next segment.
[00:25:15.056 --> 00:25:18.158]  Right now, though, because I'm at the air this Friday, I want to get this aired now.
[00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:22.422]  This film's coming out in select theaters and I want to support it and promote it.
[00:25:22.462 --> 00:25:23.443]  It's why we fight.
[00:25:24.282 --> 00:25:29.287]  But notice, though, that they have McCain playing the part of the good cop in here when McCain is for the war.
[00:25:30.048 --> 00:25:31.690]  So they do this so many times.
[00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:39.718]  We have to quote people on the opposition who are really in the same camp, like Hillary and Schumer and, of course, many others.
[00:25:39.898 --> 00:25:41.960]  But go ahead and roll this trailer.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.564]  The first thing you're going to hear is Eisenhower from his farewell address in 1961 saying,
[00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.748]  And we've aired that entire address, by the way, here.
[00:25:49.788 --> 00:25:50.448]  We should do that again.
[00:25:50.468 --> 00:25:51.389]  It's about 30 minutes long.
[00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:56.453]  Where he lays out how the military, the people that own it, are just going to take over America.
[00:25:56.713 --> 00:25:57.934]  That was Eisenhower warning you.
[00:25:57.994 --> 00:26:04.899]  And now that's what's happening using the rubric, the red herring of terrorism, which the globalists manufacture themselves.
[00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:07.261]  So here it is, the trailer for why we fight.
[00:26:08.202 --> 00:26:10.683]  From the White House, we present Dwight D. Eisenhower.
[00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:12.545]  Good evening, my fellow Americans.
[00:26:12.925 --> 00:26:14.106]  In the councils of government,
[00:26:14.665 --> 00:26:18.228]  We must guard against the military-industrial complex.
[00:26:24.793 --> 00:26:27.536]  The United States is the greatest force for good in the world.
[00:26:27.716 --> 00:26:34.662]  We have not an obligation to go out and start wars, but certainly to spread democracy and freedom throughout the world.
[00:26:36.354 --> 00:26:38.695]  The defense budget is three quarters of a trillion dollars.
[00:26:38.895 --> 00:26:41.056]  Profits went up last year well over 25%.
[00:26:41.836 --> 00:26:44.717]  When war becomes that profitable, you're going to see more of it.
[00:26:46.778 --> 00:26:50.719]  There is a huge flow of cash into defense industries.
[00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:53.600]  Sixty-six billion dollars for our men and women in uniform.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.901]  And a hundred million dollars to upgrade ten additional B-1 bombers.
[00:26:56.921 --> 00:26:58.081]  You do have to follow the money.
[00:26:58.121 --> 00:27:00.942]  It's the representatives' duty to bring home the bacon.
[00:27:00.982 --> 00:27:02.243]  God bless our contractors.
[00:27:06.002 --> 00:27:07.063]  Kids are dying.
[00:27:07.344 --> 00:27:09.306]  Billions are being spent every month.
[00:27:09.326 --> 00:27:12.008]  And the American people are scratching their heads going, how did we get here?
[00:27:12.188 --> 00:27:14.491]  This is not about one president or one party.
[00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:18.755]  When does the United States go from a force for good to a force of imperialism?
[00:27:20.076 --> 00:27:20.977]  We've got an empire.
[00:27:21.257 --> 00:27:27.323]  There is no excuse for 725 American military bases in 130 foreign countries.
[00:27:27.463 --> 00:27:29.465]  I think numbers almost are distracting.
[00:27:31.237 --> 00:27:35.640]  9-11 showed us war can be privatized, destruction can be privatized.
[00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:38.202]  What we are risking is the Republic itself.
[00:27:38.282 --> 00:27:40.023]  Collusion is our business.
[00:27:40.103 --> 00:27:41.925]  Collusion with the military.
[00:27:43.186 --> 00:27:48.349]  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
[00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:51.492]  Well...
[00:27:52.774 --> 00:27:57.816]  So you see, that's the reason this broadcast is growing and has gained so many new affiliates.
[00:27:57.956 --> 00:28:00.536]  This broadcast is exploding right now.
[00:28:00.576 --> 00:28:06.178]  That's why the web traffic to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com is just growing and growing.
[00:28:06.898 --> 00:28:07.859]  And listen, I'm not bragging.
[00:28:07.899 --> 00:28:08.599]  It is humbling.
[00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:09.439]  It freaks me out.
[00:28:09.459 --> 00:28:13.140]  We need all of us to do a better job on my team, myself included.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:13.980]  We do a great job.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.761]  We need to do a better job.
[00:28:15.401 --> 00:28:22.203]  You know, when one of my websites, not two combined, but one this weekend, was rated with more traffic than the Dallas Morning News.
[00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:28.008]  Yes, millions of people every couple days to one of my sites.
[00:28:28.568 --> 00:28:30.569]  Now again, I'm just one person in this fight.
[00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:32.370]  That is so encouraging.
[00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.771]  People are listening.
[00:28:34.151 --> 00:28:36.693]  Back when I told them about camps ten years ago, they weren't listening.
[00:28:36.933 --> 00:28:37.873]  But see, they heard me.
[00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:39.174]  They just didn't believe it.
[00:28:39.294 --> 00:28:43.156]  Now they see it and they go, whoa, this guy knows what he's talking about.
[00:28:43.176 --> 00:28:44.877]  And again, you can know what you're talking about.
[00:28:45.097 --> 00:28:45.738]  It isn't hard.
[00:28:45.778 --> 00:28:46.538]  It's all public.
[00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:47.539]  It's all right here.
[00:28:48.658 --> 00:28:55.901]  They all brag about what they're going to do to you, and how you're stupid, and how you're a slave, and how they're going to pull this on you, and how they own both parties.
[00:28:56.642 --> 00:29:08.687]  We can wake up and get this country back, or we can watch these criminals carry out more terror attacks, and really, you think privatization's gotten bad now, where these private corporations become government, and the mercenaries are on the streets of America?
[00:29:08.707 --> 00:29:13.469]  I mean, Houston Chronicle, Halliburton building emergency camps for you and your family in America now.
[00:29:14.873 --> 00:29:19.996]  Chicago Tribune, Halliburton runs the slave camps in Europe with the kidnapped families, working as slaves.
[00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.138]  I mean, I'm sorry that sounds crazy.
[00:29:22.178 --> 00:29:22.678]  I'm sorry.
[00:29:22.918 --> 00:29:23.959]  But it's real, folks.
[00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:25.400]  This is who we're dealing with.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.222]  We're dealing with cold-hearted killers.
[00:29:29.743 --> 00:29:31.944]  We're dealing with the real evildoers.
[00:29:32.805 --> 00:29:36.527]  You want evildoers, we've got the evidence on evidence on evidence.
[00:29:36.847 --> 00:29:38.949]  Legion upon legion of evil.
[00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.072]  It's just everywhere.
[00:29:41.552 --> 00:29:42.674]  Pick a target, any target.
[00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.296]  Throw a dart any direction you want.
[00:29:44.316 --> 00:29:45.918]  You're going to hit evil on the nose.
[00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:47.179]  So pick a target.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.621]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:49.482]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.885 --> 00:29:52.806]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.287 --> 00:29:54.889]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:11.127]  For thousands of years, the secret of vitality, strength, virility, and endurance was kept by the ancient Incas until now.
[00:30:11.828 --> 00:30:26.381]  Maca, a tuberous plant that only grows in one area of the Andes Mountains, is a functional food and it contains no cholesterol, is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, five natural sterols, and seven of the nine essential amino acids.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.305]  The folks at Vitamir have now made maca available in powder form so that you can experience its nutritional benefits.
[00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:35.246]  Call 877-817-9829 to order maca today.
[00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:44.644]  Maca also contains tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and fatty acids not found in other foods.
[00:30:45.224 --> 00:30:48.326]  Try Maca, and you'll know the secret of the ancient Incas.
[00:30:48.747 --> 00:30:49.047]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:49.067 --> 00:30:51.289]  That's 877-817-9829, and order your Maca today.
[00:30:51.369 --> 00:30:51.549]  Maca.
[00:30:51.609 --> 00:30:52.790]  Now you'll know the secret.
[00:31:01.973 --> 00:31:05.557]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:06.097]  are located?
[00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:09.680]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.624]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[00:32:01.397 --> 00:32:02.498]  You don't love me anymore?
[00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:04.618]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:32:04.639 --> 00:32:06.099]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:06.559]  Yes.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.740]  You neglect me.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.841]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:32:11.682 --> 00:32:12.682]  Use the cheapest gas?
[00:32:13.022 --> 00:32:13.903]  I'm getting sick.
[00:32:14.223 --> 00:32:16.384]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[00:32:17.444 --> 00:32:17.924]  Wait a minute.
[00:32:18.024 --> 00:32:19.645]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:32:19.865 --> 00:32:28.447]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[00:32:28.888 --> 00:32:34.369]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:32:34.589 --> 00:32:36.970]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:41.791]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[00:32:42.031 --> 00:32:43.672]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:32:43.852 --> 00:32:47.193]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[00:33:02.152 --> 00:33:07.916]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.899 --> 00:33:28.691]  Well, later in the next hour, I'm going to get into the Muslims out what looks to be spontaneously burning embassies in the Middle East and threatening to do it, of course, in Europe itself.
[00:33:30.413 --> 00:33:38.200]  And saying that you better not show the Prophet Muhammad a caricature or a likeness, period, much less one making fun of him.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.162]  And it's free speech, folks.
[00:33:41.182 --> 00:33:49.529]  I mean, obviously, if I owned the newspaper, I probably wouldn't encourage my editorial cartoonist to make fun of Jesus, Muhammad, anybody.
[00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:51.370]  It just stirs up trouble.
[00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:59.177]  But if somebody got in trouble for it at another paper and people were threatening to kill him, I would then publish it on the front page.
[00:34:00.077 --> 00:34:03.159]  Which is what we're doing right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.421]  We believe in free speech.
[00:34:05.561 --> 00:34:07.342]  We believe in free speech for everybody.
[00:34:08.323 --> 00:34:17.569]  Whether it is some distasteful caricature of Muhammad, or the Virgin Mary art display with elephant dung all over it.
[00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:24.514]  Because the minute you start arresting people, and they've arrested journalists in Jordan who...
[00:34:26.976 --> 00:34:31.179]  Then everybody loses their free speech, and people need to figure that out.
[00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.161]  Speaking of free speech, but I'm going to comment more on this.
[00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:36.783]  There's more behind the story, and that's coming up.
[00:34:38.384 --> 00:34:42.107]  We have Professor Deborah Libstadt.
[00:34:42.227 --> 00:34:43.588]  I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.591]  She's got one of the best-selling history books of the year right now.
[00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:48.351]  She'll tell you about it.
[00:34:48.811 --> 00:34:51.053]  But here's the BBC headline I saw last week.
[00:34:51.273 --> 00:34:53.495]  Irving, let the guy go home.
[00:34:54.224 --> 00:35:00.893]  David Irving, the infamous British war historian, is today sitting in an Austrian jail accused of denying the Nazi Holocaust.
[00:35:01.274 --> 00:35:09.485]  So why is an American Jewish academic who dramatically crushed Irving in the British court saying he should be released?
[00:35:09.646 --> 00:35:11.188]  And again, Professor Lipstadt, who I have...
[00:35:11.728 --> 00:35:14.250]  I think I saw her on 60 Minutes a few years ago when she beat him in court.
[00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:16.873]  He went after her for libel, saying it wasn't true.
[00:35:16.893 --> 00:35:21.777]  And, of course, David Irving says that most of the Holocaust is exaggerated or didn't happen.
[00:35:21.837 --> 00:35:26.601]  And, frankly, I haven't investigated it that much, but I know that Hitler did kill a bunch of people, folks.
[00:35:26.641 --> 00:35:28.102]  Wasn't a very nice person.
[00:35:28.382 --> 00:35:29.743]  I'm not here to debate that, though.
[00:35:30.244 --> 00:35:38.711]  If somebody wants to say 10 billion Martians were killed by Hitler, or true, false, whatever, it's their right to say it.
[00:35:39.759 --> 00:35:40.419]  You're welcome.
[00:35:57.456 --> 00:36:01.377]  First off, just in a nutshell, tell us your history with David Irving.
[00:36:01.437 --> 00:36:06.719]  About 10 years ago I wrote a book called Denying the Holocaust, The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:21.386]  It was essentially a book which investigated the history of Holocaust denial and argued that deniers are nothing but anti-Semites and many of them are racists and conspiracy theorists.
[00:36:21.426 --> 00:36:23.807]  I showed how they manipulate information, etc., etc.,
[00:36:25.409 --> 00:36:35.320]  In the book, I devoted maybe 200 words to David Irving, saying that the man denies the Holocaust, and making the argument that he is someone who knows the truth.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.421]  He knows the documents.
[00:36:36.521 --> 00:36:37.903]  It's not like he's been misled.
[00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:45.591]  He knows the documents and he lies and distorts them, and by implication that he was also a racist and an anti-Semite.
[00:36:45.902 --> 00:36:54.826]  Well, he sued me for libel in a British court where the burden of proof is on the defendant to prove the truth of what you said and not on the plaintiff or the claimant to prove the falsehood.
[00:36:55.066 --> 00:36:59.027]  It's essentially a mirror image of what we have here in the United States.
[00:36:59.248 --> 00:37:02.489]  I was essentially tied up in a lawsuit with him for close to six years.
[00:37:03.249 --> 00:37:07.291]  Years of preparation, four months in trial, and then about a year and a half of appeals.
[00:37:08.511 --> 00:37:11.453]  But then you ended up in the big high British court beating him.
[00:37:11.493 --> 00:37:15.075]  Beating him totally on virtually every point.
[00:37:15.175 --> 00:37:18.837]  The judge ended up calling him a liar, a distorter, a falsifier of history.
[00:37:18.857 --> 00:37:20.478]  Tell us about your new book.
[00:37:20.858 --> 00:37:24.200]  My new book is called History on Trial, My Day in Court with David Irving.
[00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.992]  And it's the story of the trial.
[00:37:27.032 --> 00:37:28.674]  It's my personal story as well.
[00:37:28.694 --> 00:37:30.575]  It weaves three themes together.
[00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:39.903]  It's a courtroom drama because this was a pretty dramatic scene in the courtroom and how we built this case and really left the guy on the floor, on the mat.
[00:37:40.784 --> 00:37:43.226]  It's a historical in showing how
[00:37:44.617 --> 00:37:53.700]  How deniers manipulate, how they lie, showing their tactics, and showing that once you track the footnotes, that their whole argument falls down like a house of cards.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.101]  Now let's fast forward to David Irving.
[00:37:56.121 --> 00:38:03.523]  For a few months now, he was over in Austria to give a speech, and they arrested him under these laws.
[00:38:03.563 --> 00:38:04.623]  Tell us about those laws.
[00:38:04.683 --> 00:38:05.804]  In 1947, Austria passed a law
[00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:17.054]  Making it illegal to minimize the crimes of the Third Reich.
[00:38:17.534 --> 00:38:21.918]  And underneath, and included as part of that, is minimizing or denying the Holocaust.
[00:38:22.098 --> 00:38:25.661]  But Hitler had laws saying you couldn't undermine the Reich.
[00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:27.423]  I mean, I see it as Hitlerian.
[00:38:28.504 --> 00:38:33.949]  Well, I think, you know, considering that, you know, while I'm against, in principle, against laws...
[00:38:34.409 --> 00:38:36.631]  Well, you say, Professor, let the guy go home.
[00:38:36.651 --> 00:38:38.913]  He has spent enough time in prison, three months.
[00:38:40.314 --> 00:38:43.576]  I don't think he should spend any time in prison.
[00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:44.817]  So, I mean, where do you stand on this?
[00:38:44.837 --> 00:38:47.919]  Do you think he should serve three months in prison or no time in prison?
[00:39:03.951 --> 00:39:08.194]  The fact is that by the time... He violated Austrian law.
[00:39:08.694 --> 00:39:10.855]  He knew he was violating Austrian law.
[00:39:11.275 --> 00:39:12.796]  Austria is a democracy.
[00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:16.459]  Their people have democratically passed these laws.
[00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:17.839]  Is America a democracy?
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.760]  I think so.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:26.885]  So in America, if 51% say put you in jail if you deny the Holocaust or criticize homosexuals... No, I think it's passing...
[00:39:27.245 --> 00:39:28.905]  Hold on, Professor.
[00:39:28.945 --> 00:39:29.826]  We're a republic.
[00:39:30.006 --> 00:39:37.848]  So if 99% doesn't like 1%, that 99% can't pass a law saying the 1% goes to jail.
[00:39:37.968 --> 00:39:41.088]  And that's the difference between a democracy and a republic.
[00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:41.889]  That's true.
[00:39:41.969 --> 00:39:43.169]  That's absolutely true.
[00:39:43.509 --> 00:39:44.289]  And I agree with you.
[00:39:44.709 --> 00:39:51.651]  But I also understand in 1947, Austria... Remember, the Holocaust, Hitler was an Austrian.
[00:39:52.211 --> 00:39:55.856]  The whole thing started in Austria as much as it started in Germany.
[00:39:55.896 --> 00:39:56.277]  No, I know.
[00:39:56.317 --> 00:39:58.960]  And then he was in Vienna, and then he went to World War I. Right, exactly.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.823]  So Austria was part of this.
[00:40:00.843 --> 00:40:07.672]  I don't agree, and I wouldn't have agreed with the passage of the laws, but I'm trying to understand the historical context.
[00:40:08.246 --> 00:40:10.267]  Of why they decided to do this.
[00:40:10.707 --> 00:40:15.369]  But at this point... Well, Professor, let me bring this up to you, because this is why I've got you on, and I'll just lay my cards on the table, okay?
[00:40:15.989 --> 00:40:23.692]  I don't like white supremacists, and I'm not into all of that, but at the same time, I don't like black supremacists or Hispanic supremacists.
[00:40:23.712 --> 00:40:27.854]  I don't even know if you're aware of those groups that are out there and quite large, a lot bigger than the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:40:28.234 --> 00:40:34.819]  But at the same time, I believe that Ernst Sundell and David Irving have a right to write what they want and do what they want.
[00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:39.883]  And I know our government's signing treaties, more and more of these foreign governments, trying to regulate the web.
[00:40:40.303 --> 00:40:43.866]  I've never said they don't have the right to say what they want.
[00:40:43.886 --> 00:40:44.126]  No, I know.
[00:40:44.166 --> 00:40:45.968]  I'm trying to get your take on that.
[00:40:46.008 --> 00:40:47.589]  They have the right to say what they want.
[00:40:47.929 --> 00:40:54.214]  I don't think anybody has the responsibility to put them on their show or give them a platform to speak.
[00:40:54.614 --> 00:40:58.196]  Or invite them into their university or their schools or their clubs.
[00:40:58.676 --> 00:41:00.417]  No one has a responsibility to invite liars.
[00:41:00.437 --> 00:41:01.637]  Well, that's not free speech.
[00:41:01.657 --> 00:41:02.618]  I mean, free speech is... No.
[00:41:02.738 --> 00:41:05.779]  If you want to go start a newspaper, you can just start one.
[00:41:05.939 --> 00:41:13.382]  You can start one, but if I publish a newspaper, it doesn't mean I have an obligation to put every idiot who's a liar on my editorial page.
[00:41:13.402 --> 00:41:14.103]  Well, who's saying that?
[00:41:14.143 --> 00:41:14.723]  I didn't say that.
[00:41:14.843 --> 00:41:19.545]  No, free speech is that the government doesn't have a right to regulate who goes in.
[00:41:19.605 --> 00:41:23.627]  No, I agree with you, but I mean, you're not... No, the point I'm making is...
[00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:28.288]  I never have ever called for laws against Holocaust denial.
[00:41:28.368 --> 00:41:30.429]  Well, you just made a point that I agree with.
[00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:33.430]  I have these people that say, we want to come on your show, you better let us.
[00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:33.750]  No.
[00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.090]  You're not giving us free speech.
[00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.090]  And I go, free speech?
[00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.931]  You know, private property rights doesn't mean you have the right to come move into my house.
[00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:40.332]  Bingo.
[00:41:40.392 --> 00:41:40.752]  Bingo.
[00:41:40.772 --> 00:41:41.692]  You're absolutely right.
[00:41:41.752 --> 00:41:42.632]  You're absolutely right.
[00:41:42.672 --> 00:41:43.292]  I agree with you.
[00:41:43.612 --> 00:41:43.893]  Fine.
[00:41:44.113 --> 00:41:47.113]  And I'll tell you, some of my colleagues at various universities don't get that point.
[00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:51.074]  They think free speech means that some of the students think free speech means you have to give everybody a chance.
[00:41:51.115 --> 00:41:52.795]  That doesn't mean you have to give everybody a chance.
[00:41:53.294 --> 00:41:56.675]  I mean, if a guy wants to stand in front of your building making his speech, he can do it.
[00:41:56.695 --> 00:42:00.916]  It doesn't mean he has the right to step one foot inside your building if it's your building.
[00:42:01.416 --> 00:42:10.018]  In any case, but... But, I mean, let me just add this, because, I mean, what you're saying is true about free speech, and a lot of people really get it confused.
[00:42:10.038 --> 00:42:14.959]  But on the other side of the coin, we have the Bush administration targeting peace groups, activists...
[00:42:15.339 --> 00:42:15.839]  We're good to go.
[00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:35.906]  Well, that I don't.
[00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:39.088]  I don't want to comment on that because I'm not up to date on that.
[00:42:39.108 --> 00:42:39.928]  I can read the bill to you.
[00:42:40.208 --> 00:42:49.533]  I'm sure you can, but... Well, I mean, are you aware that there is an attack on, quote, the classical left's free speech right now in America?
[00:42:50.813 --> 00:43:02.479]  I think that there have been attempts, and certainly if these reports are true, that there's been monitoring of ecological groups and groups that want various and sundry other things
[00:43:03.135 --> 00:43:04.396]  I think that's kind of outrageous.
[00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:07.818]  Well, they don't let you in a Bush Town Hall meeting that's advertised as... I think that's outrageous.
[00:43:07.938 --> 00:43:08.818]  I think that's outrageous.
[00:43:09.138 --> 00:43:11.240]  I mean, the claim is open to the public, and it really isn't.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.160]  Right, I think you're right.
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:15.162]  You have to sign little forms swearing you're a Bush supporter.
[00:43:15.182 --> 00:43:15.442]  That's right.
[00:43:15.462 --> 00:43:16.903]  You won't get an argument on me on that.
[00:43:17.183 --> 00:43:17.843]  Okay.
[00:43:18.143 --> 00:43:22.966]  But I don't, you know, but specifically on, I think in terms of
[00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:26.020]  David Irving, I have two points here.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.981]  One is the free speech issue.
[00:43:28.261 --> 00:43:31.342]  The second is a strategic point, a tactical point.
[00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:40.385]  And the tactical point is that I'm concerned that if they keep him in jail, he'll turn into a martyr for the cause of free speech.
[00:43:40.966 --> 00:43:43.687]  And people like you and others, they're all goodwill.
[00:43:43.767 --> 00:43:45.967]  And I'm not saying that you'll agree with anything he says.
[00:43:46.007 --> 00:43:47.408]  You don't have to agree with anything he says.
[00:43:48.522 --> 00:43:50.865]  We'll begin to say this is outrageous.
[00:43:50.885 --> 00:43:52.667]  He's a martyr on the altar of free speech.
[00:43:52.687 --> 00:43:54.208]  Professor Lipstadt, I agree.
[00:43:54.269 --> 00:43:55.690]  It's already happened.
[00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:57.432]  Do you know what's happened with Ernst Zundel?
[00:43:58.093 --> 00:44:04.601]  I mean, that case has turned millions of people against people like yourself.
[00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:05.961]  Well, that's crazy.
[00:44:06.021 --> 00:44:14.765]  I mean, Ernst Sundell is in jail not simply for Holocaust and all, but for his connection with various terrorist groups, etc., etc.
[00:44:15.065 --> 00:44:16.706]  But I want to stay with Irving for the moment.
[00:44:17.086 --> 00:44:18.286]  But I think it's... Well, wait a minute.
[00:44:18.306 --> 00:44:19.247]  You said terrorist groups.
[00:44:19.327 --> 00:44:20.747]  I haven't read that in the Canadian papers.
[00:44:20.787 --> 00:44:21.407]  What are you saying?
[00:44:21.628 --> 00:44:23.588]  Well, I'm going to stay away from that.
[00:44:23.668 --> 00:44:28.830]  I have not followed... I'm not as currently up to date right now on Sundell as I am on Irving.
[00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.832]  Should people go to jail just because the government claims they have terrorist connections?
[00:44:31.872 --> 00:44:32.252]  No, of course not.
[00:44:32.312 --> 00:44:32.772]  Of course not.
[00:44:32.892 --> 00:44:34.213]  Of course not, of course not.
[00:44:34.233 --> 00:44:38.515]  The poor guy's lived here since he was a teenager, and I mean, now he's in a German jail.
[00:44:39.375 --> 00:44:44.538]  And you know they're just going to use him as a template to put me in prison.
[00:44:44.878 --> 00:44:49.300]  Well, I'm not sure, I don't think that's exactly correct, but in any case...
[00:44:50.078 --> 00:44:59.785]  I think there's a strategic element here, too, and you're illustrating it exactly, that while you may abhor what Zundel says, you end up having to defend him.
[00:45:00.025 --> 00:45:01.246]  He's a cause celeb right now.
[00:45:01.266 --> 00:45:01.726]  That's right.
[00:45:01.786 --> 00:45:02.207]  That's right.
[00:45:02.307 --> 00:45:02.667]  You're right.
[00:45:02.947 --> 00:45:03.928]  And I don't want that to happen.
[00:45:03.948 --> 00:45:08.691]  Look, by the end of my trial, David Irving was the laughingstock of the British press.
[00:45:08.991 --> 00:45:12.874]  At one point, he turned to the judge, and instead of saying, Your Lordship, he said, Mein Führer.
[00:45:14.225 --> 00:45:22.919]  You know, another time when we asked him to prove how he made a claim about someone being at a meeting and, you know, whatever it was.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.301]  We said, how do you know he was there?
[00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.804]  He said, oh, that was author's license.
[00:45:26.335 --> 00:45:28.417]  What does Mein Fuhrer mean?
[00:45:29.118 --> 00:45:32.061]  Mein Fuhrer was how you greeted Hitler.
[00:45:32.181 --> 00:45:35.484]  No, I know it means Mein Leader, but why was he saying it to the judge?
[00:45:35.604 --> 00:45:39.408]  He looked at the judge and instead of saying, Your Lordship, he said, Mein Fuhrer.
[00:45:39.728 --> 00:45:40.449]  It was a mistake.
[00:45:40.469 --> 00:45:41.369]  I don't think he meant it.
[00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.031]  You think it was a Freudian slip?
[00:45:43.551 --> 00:45:44.793]  I'm not a psychologist.
[00:45:44.833 --> 00:45:48.176]  I'm not saying he meant it and did a sick heil or anything.
[00:45:49.056 --> 00:45:52.178]  I think it was a slip, but I think it was... So he wasn't like Dr. Strangelove, going, No!
[00:45:52.318 --> 00:45:53.138]  My turn!
[00:45:53.259 --> 00:45:54.239]  I can walk!
[00:45:54.559 --> 00:46:00.462]  Well, when he did it, a friend of mine who was sitting there started to grab onto his arm, just like a scene out of Dr. Strangelove.
[00:46:00.782 --> 00:46:01.603]  It was quite amusing.
[00:46:01.623 --> 00:46:02.663]  Even the judge was laughing.
[00:46:02.743 --> 00:46:06.845]  Of course we can create a group of belly bombs connected to computers.
[00:46:06.905 --> 00:46:07.406]  Exactly.
[00:46:07.486 --> 00:46:17.471]  But in any case, Alex, my point is that I think that the guy was left... The final chapter of my book, History on Trial, is called The Court Jester.
[00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:20.942]  And it makes the argument that it's one thing to defeat your enemy.
[00:46:21.322 --> 00:46:25.384]  It's another thing to leave them wrapped in ridicule of their own making.
[00:46:25.904 --> 00:46:31.467]  That they sort of become a mock... They've made themselves into a mock... So you don't want to make a martyr out of these people?
[00:46:32.127 --> 00:46:32.867]  Exactly.
[00:46:33.348 --> 00:46:38.970]  And, you know, after the trial, I decided I had been doing so much press and traveling so much, I just decided one day I was home.
[00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:40.911]  I wanted to go rent some movies.
[00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:45.793]  So I went to the local store and I picked up two movies without thinking what I was getting...
[00:46:46.266 --> 00:46:50.828]  I rented Charlie Chaplin, The Great Dictator, and Mel Brooks, The Producer.
[00:46:50.848 --> 00:46:53.949]  Those are both good movies, John.
[00:46:53.989 --> 00:46:55.050]  Yeah, very excellent movies.
[00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:55.850]  First-rate movies.
[00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:56.290]  Classics.
[00:46:56.770 --> 00:47:04.834]  When I got to the counter, the clerk, who, much to my amazement, actually knew something about films, said, You interested in Hitler or comedy?
[00:47:04.854 --> 00:47:06.534]  So I said, Both, I guess.
[00:47:06.554 --> 00:47:10.236]  And then I realized why I had rented those films, because what we had done to David Irving...
[00:47:10.672 --> 00:47:15.540]  It's left him, not purposely, he did it himself, but we just put the ammunition out there.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.922]  We just put the information out there.
[00:47:17.943 --> 00:47:20.187]  He was left looking completely silly.
[00:47:20.954 --> 00:47:25.737]  His arguments showed that he completely lied and distorted and made up things.
[00:47:26.297 --> 00:47:43.507]  But, Professor, I think part of the problem is, just from what I've seen even in mainstream press reports, is that years ago, especially with the Soviets, they did, because there have been revisions in numbers, not below the six million point, but at particular camps, where, oh, four million died at this camp, and they go, no, actually a million did.
[00:47:43.547 --> 00:47:44.147]  Well, what happened?
[00:47:44.167 --> 00:47:46.228]  No, no, you're right, but that's a good point.
[00:47:46.308 --> 00:47:47.209]  That's a very good point.
[00:47:48.005 --> 00:47:51.568]  Right after the war, the Soviets said 4 million people had been murdered at Auschwitz.
[00:47:52.028 --> 00:47:56.471]  When people began to go over the records and look at it more carefully, they realized that's impossible.
[00:47:56.491 --> 00:47:57.452]  It had been 1 million.
[00:47:57.912 --> 00:48:00.334]  So that's probably where the stories kind of started.
[00:48:00.354 --> 00:48:00.954]  Well, no.
[00:48:00.974 --> 00:48:02.275]  People were denying it even before that.
[00:48:02.295 --> 00:48:05.957]  But, of course, every time... So the good, as serious as science said, well, it's a mistake.
[00:48:05.977 --> 00:48:06.658]  You correct it.
[00:48:06.678 --> 00:48:07.639]  You don't stand by it.
[00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:08.739]  I'll give you another example.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.541]  The idea of people being made into soap.
[00:48:11.941 --> 00:48:14.643]  We have no evidence that they ever were able to do that.
[00:48:14.723 --> 00:48:17.025]  That it wasn't... I hate to say this when you're talking about
[00:48:17.577 --> 00:48:17.978]  We're good to go.
[00:48:26.585 --> 00:48:28.645]  To produce soap out of cadavers.
[00:48:29.066 --> 00:48:34.907]  So when people say to me, oh, they made people into soap, I say, no, we don't really know that that's true, and probably it's not true.
[00:48:35.327 --> 00:48:39.228]  I'm not saying by that that, consequently, the Nazis were good guys.
[00:48:39.328 --> 00:48:52.931]  I'll tell you what we do know that nobody wants to touch, that IBM, Mr. Watson, that the tattoos were to be entered into those computers, and that IBM today is at the forefront of digitalizing today, and that nobody wants to talk about that.
[00:48:54.295 --> 00:48:57.958]  Well, the IBM story is much more complicated than we have time for, but you're right.
[00:48:57.998 --> 00:49:06.264]  The early IBM did help with the categorizing of people's racial identity when the Nazis were doing identity cards.
[00:49:06.324 --> 00:49:09.147]  And they're at the forefront of that technology today.
[00:49:09.927 --> 00:49:14.310]  Well, it may be a leap to make the IBM of 41 to 41.
[00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:21.076]  I happen to know what their global policy is, their global strategic outlook and plans.
[00:49:21.236 --> 00:49:21.376]  Okay.
[00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:24.620]  You may well be, but I'm... On another subject, I understand.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:33.029]  But in any case, I think the point is that the guy was left looking ridiculous and really pathetic.
[00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.431]  And that's the point.
[00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:35.912]  But, Professor, my point is this.
[00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:36.133]  You...
[00:49:36.853 --> 00:49:38.735]  The analogy may not be quite right because
[00:50:04.935 --> 00:50:12.580]  In this country, the argument is, and I happen to agree with it, is that some of the things that have been done have broken, have violated American law.
[00:50:14.081 --> 00:50:17.923]  So wait a minute, you really are for them going after these people?
[00:50:18.843 --> 00:50:20.343]  No, no, no, not at all.
[00:50:20.463 --> 00:50:26.465]  I'm saying that, for instance, the hearings that are going to take place today, I think, in Arlen Specter's committee.
[00:50:26.505 --> 00:50:28.005]  Oh, you're talking about Bush, okay.
[00:50:28.045 --> 00:50:29.865]  Yeah, those things violated the law.
[00:50:29.885 --> 00:50:34.326]  So I'm not saying that, you know, it is an analogy that I'm foregoing against certain people.
[00:50:34.346 --> 00:50:35.386]  I understand, I understand.
[00:50:35.426 --> 00:50:36.787]  Final segment with you, Professor.
[00:50:37.007 --> 00:50:40.147]  Quick three-minute break, and then I want to come back and talk to you on the other side.
[00:50:40.187 --> 00:50:44.128]  Final segment with you, and we'll plug some web sacks in your book as well.
[00:50:44.848 --> 00:50:53.614]  And we're talking to Professor Deborah Lipstadt, and she's the lady that beat David Irving a decade ago whenever he sued her for libel or slander there in the British courts.
[00:50:53.914 --> 00:50:55.255]  We'll be right back and talk to her.
[00:50:55.275 --> 00:50:55.656]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.006 --> 00:51:08.848]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:09.148 --> 00:51:10.528]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.708 --> 00:51:12.909]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.929 --> 00:51:15.169]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:06.992]  All right, Professor Debra Lindstad, best-selling author, joining us.
[00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:16.557]  And regardless of which side of this debate you fall on, folks, we should all agree on the First Amendment, free speech, no matter what country you're in, free speech.
[00:54:17.237 --> 00:54:27.225]  My two final points to her are, I want to get her comment on the whole Muhammad, Prophet Muhammad cartoons, and how that ties into this whole free speech debate, and a lot of that coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:28.006 --> 00:54:33.170]  And then I want to add the point to her, she mentions the word conspiracy theory, and let me tell you how this works.
[00:54:35.166 --> 00:54:39.409]  One group gets mad at me because I won't sit here and turn this into a bash Israel fest.
[00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:54.017]  And then because I do talk about government corruption, it's also like a little label that is used where if you criticize anything the government's doing, or the policy of the Federal Reserve, or the policy of globalism, they go, oh, that's code for anti-Semitism.
[00:54:54.077 --> 00:55:03.383]  So I also think there's this rampant paranoia by some of the academics and others, or maybe it's just a good tool because it's a good brush to paint somebody black with,
[00:55:05.163 --> 00:55:08.865]  It's almost like, no, you're going to take the label.
[00:55:08.885 --> 00:55:09.885]  You're going to hate us.
[00:55:09.905 --> 00:55:11.025]  You're going to bash us.
[00:55:12.526 --> 00:55:20.348]  So I've always been being pulled both directions here because these labels are so powerful, everybody wants to use them.
[00:55:20.568 --> 00:55:22.729]  Professor, can you first comment on what I was just saying?
[00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:25.410]  First of all, I hate labels.
[00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:26.950]  I don't like to label people.
[00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:32.232]  I'm very careful before I even say something is anti-Semitic, much less someone isn't anti-Semite.
[00:55:32.591 --> 00:55:34.812]  I think you have to be very careful with what you call people.
[00:55:35.552 --> 00:55:38.654]  So in that sense, you won't get an argument from me.
[00:55:39.294 --> 00:55:56.962]  In terms of the, you know, you mentioned earlier the Muslim cartoons, while I may think some of those cartoons are insulting to, and obviously they are insulting to Muslims, free speech is, you know, the publisher of that paper, the editor of that paper, they have shown poor judgment.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.822]  But he certainly, if there is a real free speech in Denmark, he didn't break any laws.
[00:56:01.842 --> 00:56:03.482]  Well, you're allowed to have.
[00:56:03.522 --> 00:56:06.143]  You're allowed to have bad taste.
[00:56:06.243 --> 00:56:08.004]  Absolutely, that's right.
[00:56:08.044 --> 00:56:15.047]  The First Amendment gives you the right to go out on the street, stand on a street corner, and make a blathering idiot of yourself.
[00:56:15.618 --> 00:56:20.483]  That's exactly what... But now this is the point I want to bring up on that as a caveat or a side issue.
[00:56:21.163 --> 00:56:31.633]  How does Europe claim it has free speech in the very countries where you can't say that the Holocaust numbers are lower, but then they say... No, you can't say the Holocaust... You can't... The numbers... That's why... Because it gets very slippery.
[00:56:31.693 --> 00:56:32.694]  It gets very slippery.
[00:56:32.754 --> 00:56:36.017]  You can't say the Holocaust didn't... What Irving didn't say, he didn't debate the numbers.
[00:56:36.457 --> 00:56:38.918]  He said, there were no gas chambers, there was no Holocaust.
[00:56:38.958 --> 00:56:41.699]  Okay, but I mean, now we're getting off into the little details.
[00:56:41.979 --> 00:56:50.303]  All I'm trying to say is, how do they claim they have free speech to show Muhammad with his head as a bomb, but then... You're right, you're right, you're right.
[00:56:50.323 --> 00:56:51.903]  I think it's, you know, a contradiction.
[00:56:57.089 --> 00:57:08.952]  And I think that the same Muslims who are marching in the streets of the various European countries, or in their own Arab countries, wherever they are, Muslim countries, should look at their own newspapers.
[00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:17.794]  And if they're talking about insulting Muhammad, they should also look at some of the cartoons which are dripping with Jewish blood and belong in the worst of the Nazi publications.
[00:57:18.294 --> 00:57:23.355]  So you've got to be careful, because if you want one thing, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[00:57:23.735 --> 00:57:33.283]  And that's why long before this issue of the cartoons came up, I was arguing against the laws of outlawing Holocaust denial.
[00:57:33.323 --> 00:57:36.706]  Okay, fire out your website for us, Professor.
[00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:45.833]  My blog is lipstat.blogspot.com, and my book is History on Trial, My Day in Court with David Irving, and I am very gratified, as you mentioned, that
[00:57:46.252 --> 00:57:49.935]  Amazon.com has declared it the number four best history book of the year.
[00:57:50.135 --> 00:57:50.615]  All right.
[00:57:50.675 --> 00:57:51.035]  Thank you.
[00:57:51.055 --> 00:57:51.916]  It's a good read.
[00:57:51.936 --> 00:57:52.877]  Thank you very much.
[00:57:52.957 --> 00:57:53.337]  Take care.
[00:57:53.517 --> 00:57:54.358]  You bet, Professor.
[00:57:54.398 --> 00:57:54.778]  Take care.
[00:57:55.298 --> 00:57:55.739]  All right.
[00:57:55.839 --> 00:58:01.943]  And again, I got her on here to grill her and nail her down where she's kind of going, well, I'm for free speech, but kind of not.
[00:58:02.763 --> 00:58:03.744]  So that's why I had her on.
[00:58:03.984 --> 00:58:06.866]  And I'm going to comment more in the next hour on it.
[00:58:07.026 --> 00:58:09.048]  I'm out of time right now, and you can comment on it, too.
[00:58:09.288 --> 00:58:10.068]  We'll open the phones up.
[00:58:10.088 --> 00:58:10.148]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:10.168 --> 00:58:11.529]  You want to talk about Israel?
[00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:12.470]  You want to talk about Arabs?
[00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:13.210]  You want to talk about Mohammed?
[00:58:16.425 --> 00:58:18.507]  Well, this is your chance.
[00:58:18.527 --> 00:58:19.107]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:58:46.977 --> 00:58:47.497]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.697 --> 00:58:48.558]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.598 --> 00:58:50.940]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.002 --> 00:58:56.165]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.131 --> 00:59:04.991]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.031 --> 00:59:09.393]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.873 --> 00:59:13.974]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.514 --> 00:59:22.997]  Well, we had that Professor Lindstad on in the last hour, and I wanted to find out if the BBC was misquoting her, talking out of both sides of her mouth.
[00:59:24.406 --> 00:59:32.952]  Because on one side she says, I'm for free speech, but oh, it is Austrian law, and three months is enough time for David Irving for saying that there wasn't a Holocaust.
[00:59:33.572 --> 00:59:36.154]  Again, I'm not debating whether it happened or didn't happen.
[00:59:36.174 --> 00:59:37.835]  I mean, clearly Hitler killed a bunch of Jews.
[00:59:38.636 --> 00:59:43.359]  I get irritated by the fact that we don't ever talk about how he killed even more Poles and more Germans, for that matter.
[00:59:43.739 --> 00:59:48.242]  I mean, he really did kill about 10 million people with his own orders and another...
[00:59:49.068 --> 00:59:52.817]  Did you know another 20 million Germans died during that war?
[00:59:52.837 --> 00:59:53.639]  20 million Germans!
[00:59:56.816 --> 01:00:00.679]  But no, in camps or by execution, about 10 million people.
[01:00:00.879 --> 01:00:04.222]  That's very conservative numbers, and millions of those were Jews, folks.
[01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:09.185]  But then I get mad at these labor socialist Zionists with their own documents.
[01:00:09.225 --> 01:00:09.986]  This is public.
[01:00:10.426 --> 01:00:12.568]  This is in the major Jewish papers in Israel.
[01:00:13.248 --> 01:00:13.989]  People learn about it.
[01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:16.971]  Hitler was like, here, come pick up Bolo's, these people.
[01:00:16.991 --> 01:00:18.152]  And they're like, no, no.
[01:00:18.552 --> 01:00:22.315]  They have to pay us to be able to get out, or they have to promise to come to Israel.
[01:00:23.856 --> 01:00:25.998]  And so that's what happened.
[01:00:26.936 --> 01:00:34.839]  And now, boy, I've opened the can of worms on this, but fine, people can discuss it, people can debate it, people can go into it if they'd like to.
[01:00:35.239 --> 01:00:40.041]  But really, Israel and all the things that have happened over there, it's a political football that's thrown around.
[01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:49.384]  And then we never focus in on the globalists and their New World Order, and nobody ever talks about the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas or the British-Dutch royal families that, from all my research, are numero uno.
[01:00:49.705 --> 01:00:53.086]  Have the Rothschilds married into these Germanic royal families?
[01:00:53.146 --> 01:00:53.406]  Yes.
[01:00:54.091 --> 01:00:57.694]  So it is bizarre who is running things.
[01:00:58.254 --> 01:01:00.896]  But regardless, we should believe in free speech.
[01:01:01.037 --> 01:01:02.117]  And now we have this headline.
[01:01:02.438 --> 01:01:03.939]  Burning down Danish embassies.
[01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:06.381]  More Straussian psychological warfare.
[01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:10.864]  On Friday, I really read about this study and figured out what was happening.
[01:01:10.904 --> 01:01:14.307]  And I just... I called Watson up and said we ought to write an article on it.
[01:01:14.327 --> 01:01:15.748]  We were both busy covering other stuff.
[01:01:15.788 --> 01:01:19.171]  But thank God, Kurt Nemo hit the nail on the head as usual.
[01:01:20.815 --> 01:01:23.537]  And he's done a great job that's up on prisonplanet.com.
[01:01:23.557 --> 01:01:24.597]  I want to read some of his article.
[01:01:24.918 --> 01:01:26.799]  It's long, full of data and information.
[01:01:27.219 --> 01:01:28.520]  All checks out with my research.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.721]  And I've got some other things I want to add to that.
[01:01:31.141 --> 01:01:33.803]  This is an inside job, so it's very sophisticated.
[01:01:34.143 --> 01:01:40.107]  So before Muslims get mad at me, or before neocons get mad at me, before liberals get mad at me...
[01:01:41.693 --> 01:01:46.956]  We're going to talk about three-dimensional politics here, not two-dimensional false paradigm you're given normally.
[01:01:47.256 --> 01:01:47.876]  Three-dimensional.
[01:01:47.956 --> 01:02:00.683]  I'm going to try to be calm and go into the zone and really explain how, just in this one little area, this is just a microcosm of everything else, how the ball bounces, how the world turns, how the globalists operate, okay?
[01:02:01.123 --> 01:02:02.644]  And I don't do this a lot because...
[01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:08.513]  It's just so complex, and I think about one facet of it, and it goes into another facet.
[01:02:08.553 --> 01:02:12.036]  It's almost like fractals, you know, wheels within wheels.
[01:02:13.737 --> 01:02:16.200]  And this is how they operate.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.081]  This is how intelligence agencies operate.
[01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:21.884]  When you read their own policy manuals, this is almost the alchemy they're using.
[01:02:22.285 --> 01:02:23.546]  But it is a science.
[01:02:23.626 --> 01:02:24.987]  It is an art form at the same time.
[01:02:25.287 --> 01:02:27.169]  It is a state of the art.
[01:02:28.004 --> 01:02:29.385]  And so we'll try to get into that.
[01:02:30.025 --> 01:02:32.026]  Two Jordan editors are arrested.
[01:02:32.046 --> 01:02:36.728]  Two Jordanian newspaper editors were published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad have been arrested.
[01:02:37.469 --> 01:02:38.589]  Outrageous!
[01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:44.112]  And I want to say to some of the extreme Muslims out there who think you're going to... Sorry, you can't come to America.
[01:02:44.152 --> 01:02:45.053]  You can't come to Europe.
[01:02:45.433 --> 01:02:48.274]  And then tell us what we can and can't do.
[01:02:48.354 --> 01:02:50.215]  We don't tell you to go eat pork.
[01:02:50.836 --> 01:02:52.897]  We don't force pork chops down your throat.
[01:02:53.817 --> 01:02:57.459]  And you're going to play into the globalist hands you already have
[01:02:58.291 --> 01:02:59.772]  And I'm going to break it down when we get back.
[01:03:01.353 --> 01:03:03.154]  People have got to get more sophisticated than this.
[01:03:03.674 --> 01:03:04.995]  You're about to really get clobbered.
[01:03:05.075 --> 01:03:08.638]  I'm trying to protect you, because in protecting you, I protect myself.
[01:03:08.858 --> 01:03:13.561]  The globalists are attacking the indigenous populations of the West and the populations of the U.S.
[01:03:13.601 --> 01:03:14.041]  as well.
[01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:20.605]  So we're all in the same frying pan together, and it's about time we stop having tribal squabbles and we figure that out.
[01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:26.589]  Don't you Muslims know most of your leaders are on globalist payroll, stirring you up with stuff like this?
[01:03:27.896 --> 01:03:28.757]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[01:03:28.777 --> 01:03:30.118]  I'm going to go into it after the break.
[01:03:31.359 --> 01:03:32.900]  Then I got stuff like this on free speech.
[01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:35.703]  Woman arrested after racist language in a Taco Bell.
[01:03:36.223 --> 01:03:39.446]  Called a black person allegedly a name, so they're charging her with a crime.
[01:03:40.027 --> 01:03:41.228]  That's baloney!
[01:03:42.409 --> 01:03:42.749]  You see?
[01:03:42.769 --> 01:03:45.732]  And no, I don't like calling black people names.
[01:03:46.312 --> 01:03:47.353]  I've had them call me names.
[01:03:47.393 --> 01:03:48.654]  I don't call the cops.
[01:03:49.615 --> 01:03:50.316]  It's free speech.
[01:03:54.577 --> 01:03:57.420]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.681 --> 01:03:58.381]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.481 --> 01:03:59.262]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:04.268]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.628 --> 01:04:11.356]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.676 --> 01:04:13.658]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.858 --> 01:04:16.700]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.464]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.664 --> 01:04:26.067]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.308 --> 01:04:33.533]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.794 --> 01:04:36.215]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.376 --> 01:04:38.097]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:53.795 --> 01:04:55.376]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.776 --> 01:05:01.518]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:01.778 --> 01:05:06.900]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:16.524]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.864 --> 01:05:21.807]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:22.147 --> 01:05:26.150]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:31.133]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:31.493 --> 01:05:37.377]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:37.737 --> 01:05:46.772]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:46.972 --> 01:05:47.994]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:48.014 --> 01:05:49.056]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.491 --> 01:06:00.832]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:06:01.052 --> 01:06:06.053]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:06:06.393 --> 01:06:14.295]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.455 --> 01:06:21.496]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:21.716 --> 01:06:22.938]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:23.078 --> 01:06:26.482]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:26.523 --> 01:06:27.644]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:27.944 --> 01:06:29.206]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:06:29.426 --> 01:06:36.255]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:06:36.376 --> 01:06:38.819]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:41.922]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[01:06:41.942 --> 01:06:41.982]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:42.002 --> 01:06:43.023]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:45.966]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.266 --> 01:07:20.636]  Okay, I'm going to get into what's really going on, the news behind the news, concerning the Prophet Muhammad caricatures being put in newspapers all over the world, starting, of course, in Europe.
[01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:26.040]  And then, of course, we're going to go to your phone calls, Jim, Tom, Clinton, Chris, Mark, and many others.
[01:07:26.969 --> 01:07:37.113]  Talk about free speech predominantly today, but there's a lot of other news coming up as well, like group airs ad on 24, hoping to influence debates on Patriot Act.
[01:07:38.393 --> 01:07:46.316]  On the last episode, the last week of 24, one of these government groups put an ad on during it, pushing the Patriot Act.
[01:07:46.336 --> 01:07:49.197]  See, this is where reality and fantasy merge.
[01:07:50.698 --> 01:07:53.199]  And so I'm going to get to that after we take some calls and cover...
[01:07:54.173 --> 01:07:55.474]  Of course, the free speech issue.
[01:07:56.354 --> 01:08:05.458]  First off, we are adding a new item, I would say every week at least, some weeks, two items, to the video and bookstore on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:07.679 --> 01:08:13.142]  And we have added 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA by Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[01:08:13.402 --> 01:08:14.722]  This is a beautiful book.
[01:08:15.483 --> 01:08:17.123]  Just full of documents and photos.
[01:08:17.163 --> 01:08:19.464]  An easy read with a great bibliography in the back.
[01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:20.325]  Charts.
[01:08:22.046 --> 01:08:22.846]  It's just so good.
[01:08:24.494 --> 01:08:25.815]  And I forget what we're selling this for.
[01:08:25.855 --> 01:08:27.556]  I think like $18 or something.
[01:08:28.697 --> 01:08:30.659]  And it's just such a nice book.
[01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:32.240]  Such a great cover, too.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.441]  People do judge books by their cover.
[01:08:34.882 --> 01:08:36.483]  And so this is a good gift to give somebody.
[01:08:36.883 --> 01:08:37.824]  Very well written.
[01:08:38.344 --> 01:08:40.346]  And his analysis is exactly the same as mine.
[01:08:40.746 --> 01:08:42.307]  And he didn't do research off me.
[01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:43.248]  I didn't do research off him.
[01:08:43.608 --> 01:08:45.429]  We just do people go look at the same evidence.
[01:08:45.509 --> 01:08:47.191]  And it's just overwhelming.
[01:08:47.971 --> 01:08:49.012]  How the globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:08:49.032 --> 01:08:49.572]  How they did it.
[01:08:50.971 --> 01:08:54.714]  And just down to the hijackers being agents, it's all there.
[01:09:08.465 --> 01:09:13.468]  By the way, this book was printed back in 94, and it's so much even more pertinent today.
[01:09:13.528 --> 01:09:19.072]  It's really a great read, a quick read, and it is $22, or $21.95, and there's only a couple thousand of these left.
[01:09:25.336 --> 01:09:26.517]  We've got a few hundred of them.
[01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:28.479]  This is going to sell out soon.
[01:09:28.499 --> 01:09:30.661]  I don't know if there will be another reprint.
[01:09:31.102 --> 01:09:38.389]  If you want this book that is really going to be a classic collector, you need to get it at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:38.409 --> 01:09:41.572]  Of course, we have Dylan Avery's new great 9-11 video, Loose Change 2.
[01:09:42.093 --> 01:09:43.194]  It's a lot better than his first.
[01:09:43.835 --> 01:09:44.635]  I'm really proud of it.
[01:09:45.256 --> 01:09:47.458]  It asks a lot of important questions from different angles of 9-11.
[01:09:48.659 --> 01:09:50.420]  And it's very important.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.361]  We have that on DVD only, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:54.381 --> 01:10:06.744]  We have a lot of package deals where you can get multiple videos and books together or other videos together and in some cases get upwards of 75% off because we want the incentive there for you to get more of the information and simply get it out to people.
[01:10:07.384 --> 01:10:14.106]  I mean, in some cases you get two items, one video is $25 and you get one more for $5 of a different title.
[01:10:14.606 --> 01:10:16.487]  I mean, it's just a lot of really good deals there.
[01:10:17.393 --> 01:10:20.114]  Or three videos for $30, depending on what videos they are.
[01:10:20.454 --> 01:10:23.896]  So a lot of great specials at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:10:24.356 --> 01:10:26.157]  And don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:10:26.317 --> 01:10:27.417]  All 14 of my films.
[01:10:28.998 --> 01:10:33.020]  My weekly TV reports at the local TV studio that's won Best of Austin.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.901]  The TV show's won Best TV Show in Austin in the Reader's Bowl.
[01:10:37.049 --> 01:10:37.650]  We're good to go.
[01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:37.950]  I think?
[01:11:03.018 --> 01:11:06.084]  All these different guests that we have here in studio with us.
[01:11:06.144 --> 01:11:07.426]  Dean Hagelin, more and more.
[01:11:07.466 --> 01:11:08.728]  That's a new feature we've added.
[01:11:08.788 --> 01:11:09.630]  It's just getting better.
[01:11:10.609 --> 01:11:12.130]  All my best audio interviews.
[01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:14.592]  We have weekly reports.
[01:11:15.072 --> 01:11:15.632]  It's all there.
[01:11:15.973 --> 01:11:18.274]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:18.294 --> 01:11:19.395]  15 cents a day.
[01:11:19.415 --> 01:11:21.396]  $5.95 a month.
[01:11:21.436 --> 01:11:26.420]  And if you get a year subscription, you get three months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.681]  And we just boosted the bandwidth again.
[01:11:29.102 --> 01:11:32.944]  Every time we hit a ceiling and it slows down, we just add more servers, more bandwidth.
[01:11:32.964 --> 01:11:34.965]  We just added that again on Friday.
[01:11:34.985 --> 01:11:37.147]  And I didn't think that was enough because then it peaked again.
[01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:38.407]  For a few hours there.
[01:11:38.888 --> 01:11:41.889]  So it slowed down from $170K to $100K if you're downloads.
[01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:43.469]  So I just put in another order.
[01:11:43.829 --> 01:11:44.650]  Money's no option.
[01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:46.690]  Just make that pipe even bigger.
[01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:50.172]  So we're keeping the quality up for you.
[01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:53.893]  It's not going to be like AOL where you get a membership there and then you can never get online.
[01:11:54.813 --> 01:11:56.694]  You're going to be able to get all the material.
[01:11:56.734 --> 01:11:58.795]  We're going to keep upgrading it as people join.
[01:11:59.095 --> 01:12:00.235]  So prisonplanet.tv
[01:12:03.288 --> 01:12:08.352]  Or you can call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:12:08.392 --> 01:12:14.636]  That's 888-253-3139 to get any of the videos or books, and they can answer all your questions when you call.
[01:12:14.657 --> 01:12:19.780]  There are also T-shirts, books on tape, bumper stickers, prisonplanet.com.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:28.567]  You can go there and go to the shopping cart to get your hands on the actual physical DVDs and tapes and all the rest of it.
[01:12:28.967 --> 01:12:29.447]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:45.057]  All right, let me just try to go over what's really happening with the rioting and the burning and the rest of it with the Muslims and the Muhammad cartoons, and then we'll go to break and come back and start taking your calls.
[01:12:45.437 --> 01:12:46.058]  Just be patient.
[01:12:46.918 --> 01:12:47.739]  This needs to be covered.
[01:12:48.139 --> 01:12:49.340]  Try to be calm and go over this.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:53.563]  There's some different things at work here, so let's just throw out the basic facts.
[01:12:54.343 --> 01:12:57.465]  Have you noticed that all of a sudden the Muslims are going wild in Europe?
[01:12:58.308 --> 01:12:59.369]  We're good to go.
[01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.970]  We're good to go.
[01:13:13.763 --> 01:13:29.791]  Have you also noticed that out of the other side of their mouth, Europe will arrest you if you say that you are for whites only, or if you even criticize, say, you're British and you criticize German produce, you'll be arrested.
[01:13:30.112 --> 01:13:32.213]  Or if you say the word homosexual, you'll be arrested.
[01:13:32.933 --> 01:13:34.814]  Or if you criticize a group, you'll be arrested.
[01:13:34.834 --> 01:13:40.237]  It isn't just the Nazis and their sympathizers or alternative historians that are being arrested.
[01:13:40.477 --> 01:13:41.317]  It's across the board.
[01:13:41.357 --> 01:13:42.058]  But they use...
[01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:42.978]  We're good to go.
[01:13:42.998 --> 01:13:43.299]  I think?
[01:14:03.795 --> 01:14:04.896]  BBC into Google.
[01:14:04.916 --> 01:14:06.396]  You'll get the BBC articles.
[01:14:07.077 --> 01:14:08.357]  Every few weeks I see them.
[01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.558]  They have huge SWAT teams all over the country.
[01:14:10.838 --> 01:14:12.979]  Your neighbor heard you say a racist comment.
[01:14:13.619 --> 01:14:14.880]  And they actually take you to jail.
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:20.763]  I mean, you talk about free speech, and see, now it's, oh, you criticize the war in Australia, you go to jail for seven years.
[01:14:20.803 --> 01:14:22.543]  See, first it's, oh, if you're a Nazi.
[01:14:22.563 --> 01:14:25.044]  Then it's, oh, well, first it's if you're a child molester.
[01:14:25.064 --> 01:14:26.505]  We all go, well, I'm not for child molesters.
[01:14:26.765 --> 01:14:27.826]  Then, oh, if you're a Nazi.
[01:14:27.866 --> 01:14:30.607]  And then, oh, if you criticize the government.
[01:14:30.687 --> 01:14:30.827]  See?
[01:14:32.077 --> 01:14:35.740]  So number one, this is Europe acting like they have free speech.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.964]  Getting up on their high horse and going, Oh look, we have free speech.
[01:14:40.044 --> 01:14:50.993]  We're all going to publish the caricatures with increasing frequency of Muhammad, where his turban is a bomb, or his hat is a bomb, or where he's a demon.
[01:14:51.634 --> 01:14:52.674]  There's been a whole bunch of them.
[01:14:55.377 --> 01:14:56.618]  So we've got that going on.
[01:14:58.259 --> 01:15:00.121]  But the most important facet is this.
[01:15:01.178 --> 01:15:03.560]  Whole treatises have been written on it.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:18.011]  It's proven that the initial rioting in France, in Paris, was stirred up by different British squads and British provocateurs, dark-skinned French, Franks, who were over there.
[01:15:19.253 --> 01:15:21.255]  And that's a whole other show, and we've done those shows.
[01:15:21.295 --> 01:15:23.258]  They went out, stirred up the first instances.
[01:15:23.618 --> 01:15:28.984]  Then the police chiefs and others came out and made comments meant to stir people up.
[01:15:29.304 --> 01:15:31.907]  Then the police held back, let it build steam.
[01:15:33.559 --> 01:15:35.020]  And Jacques Chirac is saying that he will nuke Iran.
[01:16:01.816 --> 01:16:09.239]  So magically, right on time, and of course Muslims were out in the street burning and beating people up and dragging people out of cars.
[01:16:09.359 --> 01:16:10.420]  That was a week into it.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.360]  It went on for three weeks.
[01:16:12.761 --> 01:16:13.581]  That did happen.
[01:16:13.961 --> 01:16:16.102]  It's called a snowball or a mockingbird.
[01:16:16.222 --> 01:16:18.844]  You as a government op put out the first story.
[01:16:19.204 --> 01:16:22.305]  The media gives it attention because they're ops too.
[01:16:22.525 --> 01:16:24.146]  And then they say, oh, there's hysteria.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.301]  And then the hysteria actually forms itself.
[01:16:28.381 --> 01:16:32.323]  An example of this in marketing is they caught major toy manufacturers.
[01:16:32.363 --> 01:16:36.325]  They would have 20 of their employees go in, and they'd even have a friend reporter there.
[01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:38.966]  Did you ever wonder how reporters would catch the riot for the toy?
[01:16:39.915 --> 01:16:44.157]  On tape, on video, because that's one of their PR people.
[01:16:44.417 --> 01:16:52.801]  They'd be there to get the new wonderful toy for Christmas two months before, and there'd be a riot, and women fighting over the toy would be totally staged.
[01:16:53.041 --> 01:17:00.964]  Then other people would see that, though, and there were actual people started then joining in on it, and it causes a chain reaction.
[01:17:01.004 --> 01:17:01.985]  It's like a feeding frenzy.
[01:17:02.005 --> 01:17:03.786]  It's like the globalist chum of water.
[01:17:03.806 --> 01:17:04.706]  When you're fishing for sharks...
[01:17:05.006 --> 01:17:05.526]  We're good to go.
[01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:34.590]  So it's the same thing.
[01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.652]  They start the snowball rolling, and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:17:37.852 --> 01:17:40.574]  They start the rock slide, whatever analogy you want to use, whatever.
[01:17:40.934 --> 01:17:41.394]  Parallel.
[01:17:42.415 --> 01:17:44.916]  So that's what's happening, that's what's going on over there.
[01:17:45.797 --> 01:17:47.778]  Now, at the same time, there's a whole other fashion to this.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:53.722]  Muslims will scream bloody murder when they're having their free speech restricted.
[01:17:53.742 --> 01:17:56.944]  They don't like their governments that restrict their free speech, propped up by our government.
[01:17:57.424 --> 01:17:58.865]  And in many cases, Israel propping them up.
[01:17:59.844 --> 01:18:11.083]  But they'll decry the Egyptian government having restrictions on free speech, but then they'll go out and riot over newspapers thousands of miles away having a picture of Mohammed.
[01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:18.144]  And then you've got to ask yourself, why suddenly, again, did the media give such attention to this?
[01:18:18.164 --> 01:18:20.245]  Because they've done characters of Muhammad in the past.
[01:18:20.765 --> 01:18:35.169]  Why were there all these Danish flags, brand new, not mock Danish flags, brand new fancy ones, all the same size, by the way, served up in these remote regions where most people haven't even heard of the Danes?
[01:18:36.428 --> 01:18:37.869]  So, callers, stay there.
[01:18:37.969 --> 01:18:39.089]  I've got to spend some more time.
[01:18:39.109 --> 01:18:40.190]  We'll go through this in the next segment.
[01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:42.571]  Then I'll, bottom of the hour, start going right to your calls.
[01:18:42.591 --> 01:18:51.115]  But I've got to go over this, and I want to read some of Kurt Nemo's article about this, where he hits the nail on the head, because the whole thing's staged.
[01:18:55.957 --> 01:18:57.658]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.198 --> 01:18:59.959]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.127 --> 01:19:08.993]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.233 --> 01:19:11.855]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:11.835 --> 01:19:13.256]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:20.361]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:20.621 --> 01:19:23.603]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:23.963 --> 01:19:24.464]  We're good to go.
[01:19:24.504 --> 01:19:24.784]  I think?
[01:19:59.107 --> 01:20:02.389]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:03.109 --> 01:20:07.091]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.365 --> 01:20:14.105]  We're good to go.
[01:20:14.125 --> 01:20:14.345]  I think?
[01:20:37.256 --> 01:20:37.537]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:20:53.513 --> 01:21:02.115]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:21:02.335 --> 01:21:13.617]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:21:13.837 --> 01:21:16.458]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:16.678 --> 01:21:17.218]  We're good to go.
[01:21:37.774 --> 01:21:41.720]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:42.441]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:42.461 --> 01:21:43.142]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:54.284 --> 01:22:01.167]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:14.233]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:22:14.413 --> 01:22:16.194]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:22:16.374 --> 01:22:16.974]  We're good to go.
[01:22:35.589 --> 01:22:36.149]  Shutter Trotters!
[01:22:36.249 --> 01:22:36.790]  Shutter Trotters!
[01:23:01.835 --> 01:23:03.856]  To attempt to spell it all out, it's real simple.
[01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:08.278]  The Muslims, as usual, are falling directly into the globalist's hands, being shut up.
[01:23:10.399 --> 01:23:15.781]  And clearly, governments, western governments, were involved, provocateuring it from the start.
[01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:29.078]  Going out with their faces covered saying, you know, Europe needs a 9-11, freedom means to go to hell, because we've proven the babies in the incubator stories was a total fraud by a PR firm.
[01:23:29.619 --> 01:23:40.646]  We've proven that it was old footage of them burning American flags in the West Bank on 9-11 on that day, and then a week later, clearly Israel staged one of those events, and it was Mossad dressed up.
[01:23:40.686 --> 01:23:41.507]  This is all admitted.
[01:23:42.173 --> 01:23:52.195]  See, hindsight's great, because we can look at all the stuff in the past, but see, by the time it gets admitted, it'll be in obscure journals, or it'll be in mainstream news, but again, back of the paper.
[01:23:52.415 --> 01:23:53.675]  Oh yeah, the government staged that.
[01:23:53.955 --> 01:24:07.778]  See, this is the same government that was going to paint up a whole bunch of airplanes, like UN airplanes, and fly them real low through a particular area with a lot of anti-aircraft flak and SAM missiles, serviced air missiles, and try to get them shot down.
[01:24:07.958 --> 01:24:09.718]  See, that just came out Thursday.
[01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:17.173]  This is the same crew that said, we'll have informants come out and claim that they saw WMDs when they didn't.
[01:24:18.014 --> 01:24:19.155]  That's clearly what it states.
[01:24:19.955 --> 01:24:21.496]  And it doesn't matter if we don't find them.
[01:24:21.516 --> 01:24:22.537]  We're going to say they got them.
[01:24:23.163 --> 01:24:24.684]  You see, it's the same crew.
[01:24:24.764 --> 01:24:26.726]  They've been doing this for so long.
[01:24:26.986 --> 01:24:27.826]  That's why the U.S.
[01:24:27.866 --> 01:24:28.967]  and Britain run the planet.
[01:24:29.307 --> 01:24:34.411]  Because they've got the most sneaky elite that's in control of them that know how to play people off against each other.
[01:24:34.851 --> 01:24:40.215]  And are there Muslim extremists who would put me to the sword right now if I didn't convert to Muhammad?
[01:24:40.555 --> 01:24:41.015]  To Allah?
[01:24:41.356 --> 01:24:41.676]  Yes.
[01:24:41.756 --> 01:24:42.577]  Am I against them?
[01:24:42.657 --> 01:24:43.057]  Yes.
[01:24:43.597 --> 01:24:46.880]  But are they idiots on a string controlled by the globalists?
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.342]  Did the CIA go save the Muslim Brotherhood after Hitler fell?
[01:24:50.362 --> 01:24:51.523]  They were in league with him.
[01:24:52.283 --> 01:24:56.246]  And help put them into power in a bunch of different countries?
[01:24:56.486 --> 01:25:04.411]  Because our governments, in their own public documents from the 40s and 50s, didn't want secular, free Muslim countries?
[01:25:05.012 --> 01:25:06.173]  No, they don't want you free.
[01:25:06.193 --> 01:25:12.237]  They want a bunch of nuts running around making sure women don't go to college, making sure the countries aren't free.
[01:25:14.018 --> 01:25:14.838]  That's admitted.
[01:25:14.859 --> 01:25:18.261]  Do you understand that since the 40s right through to today...
[01:25:19.198 --> 01:25:28.523]  It's even been in the Washington Post that every year millions of radical hadiths, radical manuals, not the Koran, but these... It's just like with the Bible.
[01:25:28.563 --> 01:25:32.485]  They write books about the Bible that really aren't what the Bible says, but I'm not going to get into that debate.
[01:25:33.205 --> 01:25:41.709]  Millions of these books saying, kill Americans, kill Westerners, don't let women go to school, the most radical interpretation possible.
[01:25:42.309 --> 01:25:45.491]  The globalists have been putting fertilizer on and breeding this.
[01:25:46.357 --> 01:25:51.402]  And then you go into all the news articles coming out about how this stuff is staged, and it is.
[01:25:51.863 --> 01:25:53.604]  And I don't mean those crowds of thousands of people.
[01:25:53.665 --> 01:26:05.236]  No, those are the idiots that the government's actually scared to death of in these Muslim countries that once they saw the ball rolling, once they saw the frenzy, went and jumped in.
[01:26:07.198 --> 01:26:09.641]  This is what Kurt Nemo reported on from different news articles.
[01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:14.669]  Burning down Danish embassies, more Straussian psychological warfare.
[01:26:15.029 --> 01:26:16.510]  By the way, P2OG says they'll do this.
[01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:29.816]  Amidst the corporate media feeding frenzy over the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, and by the way, we put them up on Prison Planet, you know, there's the other side of that for those Muslim extremists out there that bought into this.
[01:26:30.156 --> 01:26:30.957]  We're going to do what we want.
[01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:31.817]  It's called the First Amendment.
[01:26:31.837 --> 01:26:33.298]  If you don't like it, hey, here we are.
[01:26:34.178 --> 01:26:37.920]  I don't cotton to intimidation, to punks and carpetbaggers.
[01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:45.718]  Amid the corporate media feeding frenzy over the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in the Danish newspaper,
[01:26:46.707 --> 01:26:50.048]  In September, which then for months the media had to hype.
[01:26:50.428 --> 01:26:52.388]  It's been going on for four months, five months, see?
[01:26:52.588 --> 01:26:53.989]  They finally got it to break.
[01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:55.829]  They finally chummed the waters.
[01:26:56.429 --> 01:26:57.770]  I'm sorry, see, I'll never finish this.
[01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:10.772]  Amidst the corporate media feeding frenzy, the publication of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in Danish newspapers in September, and subsequently repeated in European media and the New Zealand in the past week, one important element has apparently slipped under the wire.
[01:27:11.233 --> 01:27:13.073]  The complicity of Danish imams...
[01:27:13.773 --> 01:27:14.953]  Totally on the payroll, folks.
[01:27:15.113 --> 01:27:15.834]  So many of them are.
[01:27:16.454 --> 01:27:17.414]  Muslims, you need to look there.
[01:27:17.814 --> 01:27:23.956]  Circulated the image of the brethren in Muslim countries, according to Charles Moore, writing for the UK Telegraph.
[01:27:24.396 --> 01:27:35.399]  When they did so, they included in their package three other, much more offensive cartoons, which had not appeared in the newspaper, which were lumped together so that many thought they had.
[01:27:35.499 --> 01:27:37.280]  See, those guys are on the payroll.
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.180]  Guaranteed.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:40.581]  Guaranteed.
[01:27:41.121 --> 01:27:42.061]  Provocateurs, folks.
[01:27:43.027 --> 01:27:44.047]  This is the Telegraph.
[01:27:44.908 --> 01:27:48.769]  Moore also finds it suspicious that there was no shortage of Danish flags to burn.
[01:27:49.289 --> 01:27:55.292]  It's hard to find a Danish flag in Austin, Texas, at the mall, much less in these Muslim countries.
[01:27:56.192 --> 01:28:09.037]  I raise the question because as soon as the fight began about the cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad in the newspaper, angry Muslims popped up in Gaza City and many other places, well-supplied with Danish flags ready to burn.
[01:28:09.397 --> 01:28:12.078]  Why were those Danish flags at hand?
[01:28:12.774 --> 01:28:22.216]  Who build up the stockpiles so that they can be quickly dragged out and right across the Muslim world and burnt where television cameras would come and look?
[01:28:22.716 --> 01:28:29.138]  Now, see, we could say Muslim groups staged this, but actually the big Muslim groups that aren't global controlled are saying this is an op right now, see?
[01:28:29.618 --> 01:28:31.759]  Because this doesn't actually help Muslims or their countries.
[01:28:32.239 --> 01:28:37.980]  This is going to get the Europeans all scared and in line to come in there and just blow your countries to pieces.
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.901]  So go out and riot and act like idiots.
[01:28:40.261 --> 01:28:41.441]  You're going to really get it now.
[01:28:43.661 --> 01:28:44.602]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.042 --> 01:28:46.664]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.585 --> 01:28:50.387]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:57.854]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:58.054 --> 01:29:01.457]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:29:01.637 --> 01:29:05.060]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:05.365 --> 01:29:08.607]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:08.627 --> 01:29:14.090]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:23.755]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:29:23.895 --> 01:29:25.196]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:29:25.216 --> 01:29:30.679]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[01:29:31.179 --> 01:29:35.601]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:37.082]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:29:37.222 --> 01:29:41.043]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:29:41.143 --> 01:29:41.963]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:29:53.596 --> 01:30:01.863]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.104 --> 01:30:06.467]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:15.676]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.896 --> 01:30:19.499]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.779 --> 01:30:24.826]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.126 --> 01:30:31.855]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.336 --> 01:30:32.877]  What about you?
[01:30:33.496 --> 01:30:36.098]  Do you desire your health and vitality to be in harmony with the rhythms of nature?
[01:31:04.918 --> 01:31:13.304]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[01:31:13.945 --> 01:31:21.390]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[01:31:21.911 --> 01:31:23.692]  This is real, not science fiction.
[01:31:24.352 --> 01:31:32.999]  Go to TriVortex.com, that is T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X.com to open a whole new realm of health and vitality for you and your family.
[01:31:35.515 --> 01:31:45.139]  This is Brian David Anderson, inventor of TriVortex technology products that assist in so many areas, such as pain relief, symptoms of menopause, losing weight, or stopping smoking.
[01:31:45.639 --> 01:31:49.600]  TriVortex technology is in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
[01:31:54.662 --> 01:31:59.804]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.465 --> 01:32:02.765]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:07.515 --> 01:32:10.936]  All right, let me just finish reading this article.
[01:32:10.956 --> 01:32:13.797]  I'm going to write to Jim, Tom, Clinton, Chris, Mark, many others.

[01:32:19.398 --> 01:32:20.758]  Burning down Danish embassies.
[01:32:20.798 --> 01:32:22.879]  More Straussian psychological warfare.
[01:32:23.199 --> 01:32:28.460]  And then this is the one in Telegraph saying it's suspicious that all these flags magically pop up.
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:30.981]  It goes on.
[01:32:31.061 --> 01:32:36.244]  Angry Muslims popped up in Gaza City and many other places, well-supplied with Danish flags ready to burn.
[01:32:36.264 --> 01:32:42.569]  You notice in the past they always have a white piece of fabric painted up like the flag because they can't find those flags in those dirt villages.
[01:32:43.609 --> 01:32:45.391]  Why were those Danish flags on hand?
[01:32:45.411 --> 01:32:48.293]  No, these were fancy, brand new, same size plastic ones.
[01:32:48.873 --> 01:32:49.253]  Nylon.
[01:32:50.134 --> 01:32:57.639]  Who built up the stockpile so they could be quickly dragged out right across the Muslim world and burnt where television cameras could come and look.
[01:32:58.337 --> 01:33:03.882]  The more you study the story of spontaneous Muslim rage, the odder it seems.
[01:33:04.042 --> 01:33:06.044]  More also... That's what he said, by the way.
[01:33:06.624 --> 01:33:08.406]  That's one telegraph, not Kurt Nemo, see?
[01:33:09.667 --> 01:33:20.296]  More also mentions Sheikh Yusuf al-Zawahiri, head of the International Association of Muslim Scholars, who has called for an International Day of Anger in response to the cartoons.
[01:33:21.176 --> 01:33:26.321]  For Straussian neocons and their fellow clash of civilization, war against Islam, travelers...
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.823]  Al-Zawari is the perfect radical Muslim for their propaganda purposes.
[01:33:33.143 --> 01:33:37.165]  He supports Palestinian suicide bombing and opposes negotiating with Israel.
[01:33:37.425 --> 01:33:55.534]  According to the neocon and Jacob C. Likudite organizer, M-E-M-R-I, Middle East Media Research Institute, he has issued a fatwa calling for the murder of all Americans in Iraq, both civilian and military.
[01:33:56.681 --> 01:34:01.265]  And it goes on, And then it goes into a bunch of other really suspicious stuff.
[01:34:01.285 --> 01:34:02.246]  It goes on for hours.
[01:34:17.379 --> 01:34:18.580]  But that's my point.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.541]  Are there Muslims who are extreme?
[01:34:20.561 --> 01:34:32.229]  Yeah, they've done major studies and polls around 6% or 7% who do want to force us all to convert by the sword if need be and who want women all wearing headdresses all the time and not learning how to read or write.
[01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.770]  Yes.
[01:34:34.231 --> 01:34:37.493]  And do those people for 50 plus years, what is it, like 58 years now,
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.421]  Since about 1947.
[01:34:42.022 --> 01:34:45.905]  Do they have total support of our government, and are they lavish with money and support?
[01:34:46.265 --> 01:34:46.986]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:47.026 --> 01:34:47.726]  Can we prove that?
[01:34:47.806 --> 01:34:48.467]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:48.807 --> 01:34:51.069]  Have I made multiple films and written books about it?
[01:34:51.129 --> 01:34:51.730]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:53.291]  Does it take all day to cover it all?
[01:34:53.331 --> 01:34:53.891]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:34:54.111 --> 01:34:55.052]  There's so much.
[01:34:55.112 --> 01:34:55.833]  That's the problem.
[01:34:56.253 --> 01:34:57.514]  It's so obvious.
[01:34:58.555 --> 01:35:02.698]  And so I want to warn the people in the Middle East over there, whether they be Christian, Muslim, it doesn't matter.
[01:35:03.279 --> 01:35:04.320]  You're being manipulated.
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.021]  Most of you know that, and you figured that out.
[01:35:07.042 --> 01:35:09.484]  This is very suspicious, so knock it off.
[01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.589]  Knock it off.
[01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:17.912]  If you want the free speech to criticize the globalists or Israel or the labor Zionists or whoever it is you don't like, then knock it off.
[01:35:18.872 --> 01:35:22.313]  If your religion says don't show pictures of the... You know what?
[01:35:22.353 --> 01:35:24.214]  Your religion also says don't have idols.
[01:35:24.714 --> 01:35:26.335]  But what do you think is on top of your mosque?
[01:35:27.175 --> 01:35:28.396]  What do you think that is up there?
[01:35:28.416 --> 01:35:29.156]  That's an ornament.
[01:35:30.176 --> 01:35:32.137]  I hear Muslims aren't supposed to wear jewelry.
[01:35:32.917 --> 01:35:34.658]  I see Muslims all the time wearing jewelry.
[01:35:35.336 --> 01:35:38.998]  So, again, I don't want to tell you your own religion, but just knock it off.
[01:35:39.298 --> 01:35:44.660]  Don't decide to get mad at this when you're violating tenets much larger every day.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.341]  But it's just like so many Christians.
[01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:50.663]  They'll sit there and tell you how to follow the Bible all day while they've got a beam in their own eye.
[01:35:51.363 --> 01:35:55.725]  It's just be as wise as a serpent and, oh, what's the quote?
[01:35:55.865 --> 01:35:57.706]  As wise as a serpent, as harmless as a dove.
[01:35:57.726 --> 01:36:01.387]  I mean, I like to say walk easy but carry a big stick.
[01:36:02.068 --> 01:36:03.408]  That isn't in the Bible, folks.
[01:36:03.768 --> 01:36:04.869]  That's another way of saying it.
[01:36:06.087 --> 01:36:06.787]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:09.008]  You need to know when to hold them, know when to fold them.
[01:36:09.429 --> 01:36:16.112]  And not just every time the globalists poke you, you go like a raging bull out of the gate so they can go, oh, look, look at the raging bull.
[01:36:16.452 --> 01:36:22.335]  But notice, all of this is starting up, and we have all the evidence, it's provocateur, right before they get ready to go into Iran.
[01:36:22.435 --> 01:36:24.796]  And now it's got Jacques Chirac saying, well, nuke Iran.
[01:36:25.136 --> 01:36:30.559]  What does nuking Iran have to do with Muslims running around terrorizing people after they were stirred up?
[01:36:30.919 --> 01:36:32.380]  I don't defend those that were stirred up.
[01:36:34.693 --> 01:36:36.714]  And it was many others that jumped in on the free-for-all.
[01:36:37.674 --> 01:36:41.516]  Why does Jacques Chirac accelerate the immigration of Muslims if they're so bad?
[01:36:41.576 --> 01:36:45.177]  Why do we need to nuke a country instead of just not putting up with riots?
[01:36:45.837 --> 01:36:47.058]  Why did the cops stand down?
[01:36:47.398 --> 01:36:50.699]  Well, see, now everybody's got the images of the Muslims doing this to themselves.
[01:36:51.457 --> 01:36:52.017]  We're good to go.
[01:36:52.057 --> 01:36:52.678]  We're good to go.
[01:37:21.315 --> 01:37:23.056]  I'm just saying, let's get our priorities straight.
[01:37:23.477 --> 01:37:24.157]  All right, that's enough.
[01:37:24.197 --> 01:37:29.020]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls here.
[01:37:30.521 --> 01:37:32.502]  And who is up first here?
[01:37:33.643 --> 01:37:35.444]  Jim and PA, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:37:35.464 --> 01:37:36.165]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:36.245 --> 01:37:36.885]  How are you today?
[01:37:37.165 --> 01:37:37.786]  Good, my friend.
[01:37:38.026 --> 01:37:41.428]  Thanks for holding through the analysis and the rant, but give us your take on it.
[01:37:41.748 --> 01:37:46.171]  Well, I'd like to get back to how you opened up the show at the trailer for the new movie, Why We Fight.
[01:37:46.906 --> 01:37:49.048]  And Eisenhower's final address.
[01:37:49.108 --> 01:37:53.951]  He should know about the military-industrial complex because he worked for the military-industrial complex.
[01:37:54.471 --> 01:37:59.795]  He ran the concentration camps in Germany, which was the disarmed enemy forces camps.
[01:38:00.424 --> 01:38:01.184]  We're defenseless.
[01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:05.227]  Old men, women, and children were put there and forced to starve to death.
[01:38:05.447 --> 01:38:11.950]  Yeah, our government killed 4 million Germans conservatively in the next two years of the occupation.
[01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:13.951]  That is an admitted number.
[01:38:14.291 --> 01:38:19.354]  Right, he became a general December 1942 without ever having even seen one battle.
[01:38:21.212 --> 01:38:22.973]  He was a logistics officer.
[01:38:22.993 --> 01:38:27.575]  And that's actually not true, that he'd never seen one battle.
[01:38:27.875 --> 01:38:34.018]  He was a logistics officer in supply, never been a combat general directing forces in battle.
[01:38:34.278 --> 01:38:40.901]  He had been a captain of World War I in the same unit as MacArthur and saw heavy action, highly decorated.
[01:38:41.362 --> 01:38:46.404]  Right, and his main function was to allow Stalin to take over Europe after the war.
[01:38:46.744 --> 01:38:48.885]  And we could see World War II was fought
[01:38:49.389 --> 01:38:56.831]  Make the world safe for communism, as Europe's become quite socialized since WWII ended.
[01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.942]  Well, I agree with you, Stalin, conservatively.
[01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:02.022]  I used to say 50 million.
[01:39:02.062 --> 01:39:05.685]  Now the official number, Russia says he killed 60 million.
[01:39:06.225 --> 01:39:09.167]  And they say, first it was 40 million, then 50, now 60.
[01:39:09.447 --> 01:39:14.091]  The official Chinese government puts out books bragging how they killed 65 million.
[01:39:14.331 --> 01:39:24.278]  Just one last point, Alex, is I'm looking at Dwight David Eisenhower's 1915 Howard Sir West Point yearbook, a photocopy of that page.
[01:39:24.918 --> 01:39:26.079]  And under there, the title is...
[01:39:27.116 --> 01:39:29.738]  White David Eisenhower, the terrible Swedish Jew.
[01:39:30.699 --> 01:39:32.100]  So, there you go.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.361]  He was a Swedish Jew, I imagine, a Zionist.
[01:39:35.682 --> 01:39:43.708]  And he killed people, but nobody seemed to persecute him after World War II, like Irving and Zundel's been persecuted.
[01:39:43.728 --> 01:39:46.130]  So I've tied in your trailer with the Lipstadt interview.
[01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:47.971]  Well, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:39:48.231 --> 01:39:49.252]  I mean, I've got to say this.
[01:39:50.862 --> 01:39:52.223]  Number one, I'm not Jewish.
[01:39:52.563 --> 01:39:54.464]  But if I was, what would it matter?
[01:39:54.484 --> 01:39:56.245]  But I get accused every day of being Jewish.
[01:39:56.985 --> 01:39:58.026]  Like it's something bad.
[01:39:58.046 --> 01:40:06.770]  I mean, my hair has turned brown, but it was platinum blonde when I was a kid, and then golden brown, and then dirty blonde, and then I have brown hair.
[01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.750]  I have blue eyes.
[01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:09.291]  I'm German, Alsatian.
[01:40:10.392 --> 01:40:13.053]  I'm Irish, Scottish, English, obviously, Jones.
[01:40:13.833 --> 01:40:16.314]  But according to people, I'm a Mossad agent.
[01:40:16.454 --> 01:40:17.355]  I'm Jewish.
[01:40:18.055 --> 01:40:19.336]  My whole family's Jewish.
[01:40:21.318 --> 01:40:23.979]  No one in my mother's family or my dad's family is Jewish.
[01:40:24.019 --> 01:40:24.740]  It's not true.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:26.421]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:40:27.562 --> 01:40:28.122]  I'm Jewish.
[01:40:28.902 --> 01:40:34.966]  And so when I hear that Eisenhower is Jewish, again, even if he was, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:35.006 --> 01:40:35.807]  He didn't look Jewish.
[01:40:35.827 --> 01:40:37.608]  He sure didn't have the features, folks.
[01:40:37.928 --> 01:40:40.189]  He looked like a square-headed German to me.
[01:40:40.890 --> 01:40:41.530]  Believe me, I know.
[01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:42.110]  I'm one of them.
[01:40:42.851 --> 01:40:42.991]  And...
[01:40:45.419 --> 01:40:52.284]  I mean, of all the different European derivations, my mother's family is like Alsatian and German on both sides, and there's a little English Pope in there.
[01:40:52.804 --> 01:40:57.227]  But regardless, folks, then I hear that he never saw combat.
[01:40:57.267 --> 01:40:58.528]  That statement you made is false.
[01:40:58.608 --> 01:41:02.311]  Now, many other statements you made were true, but I just don't know that.
[01:41:02.511 --> 01:41:03.532]  That would be interesting, though.
[01:41:03.592 --> 01:41:05.493]  I mean, I do know people do hide their Jewishness.
[01:41:06.594 --> 01:41:08.735]  Kerry hid it and then later said he was Jewish.
[01:41:09.136 --> 01:41:11.237]  Hillary's hidden it and now says she's Jewish.
[01:41:11.497 --> 01:41:13.038]  Is that true or is it a political aim?
[01:41:13.299 --> 01:41:13.679]  I don't know.
[01:41:14.691 --> 01:41:15.992]  All I know is I fight evil.
[01:41:16.673 --> 01:41:18.855]  And if you're Jewish and want to fight evil with me, then good.
[01:41:18.895 --> 01:41:22.578]  Or if you're black and want to fight evil, or you're Hispanic and want to fight evil with me, good.
[01:41:22.598 --> 01:41:26.962]  So many people never get caught up in fighting the New World Order.
[01:41:27.322 --> 01:41:30.185]  It's just caught up in talking about what seed line you're from.
[01:41:30.205 --> 01:41:32.587]  Or, you know, do you have the birthright?
[01:41:32.607 --> 01:41:33.388]  Or all of this stuff.
[01:41:33.468 --> 01:41:34.849]  I'm just here to fight evil, folks.
[01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:38.893]  Listen, I was talking to Jack Blood this weekend.
[01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:41.131]  They were inviting me out to the Super Bowl.
[01:41:41.231 --> 01:41:41.731]  I said, no.
[01:41:41.771 --> 01:41:44.332]  I was here working on a film last night and spending time with the family.
[01:41:44.372 --> 01:41:53.776]  But to make a long story short, he said, yeah, Alex, you know, I'm fighting aspartame here at the Texas level, not because I want to save people.
[01:41:53.796 --> 01:41:55.216]  It's because Jews are dying from it.
[01:41:55.236 --> 01:41:56.577]  And he was being sarcastic.
[01:41:56.597 --> 01:42:01.999]  You know, Jack Blood's not Jewish, but people say, you know, because you don't hate Israel, you must be an evil, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:42:02.019 --> 01:42:05.220]  And he said, yeah, that's why I'm fighting the toll roads, so Jews don't have to pay it.
[01:42:06.681 --> 01:42:09.122]  It's just this... Notice the people that are bashing all day and just...
[01:42:10.029 --> 01:42:10.950]  This is their radio show.
[01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:13.492]  Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.
[01:42:13.672 --> 01:42:15.253]  Did I mention Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew?
[01:42:15.453 --> 01:42:17.374]  Zionist, Zionist, Zionist, Zionist, Zionist, Zionist.
[01:42:17.555 --> 01:42:18.455]  Zionist, Zionist.
[01:42:18.936 --> 01:42:19.436]  Zionist.
[01:42:19.636 --> 01:42:20.517]  Ooh, that'll really get them.
[01:42:20.897 --> 01:42:24.600]  You read the actual Zionist documents, it says we need to create anti-Semitism.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.461]  We need to create oppression of our people.
[01:42:26.661 --> 01:42:27.982]  We want Nazi groups.
[01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:28.783]  Seriously!
[01:42:29.383 --> 01:42:30.704]  Because they all work together, folks.
[01:42:30.724 --> 01:42:33.746]  This is what the globalists do to then get us all fighting with each other.
[01:42:34.007 --> 01:42:37.269]  And then to persecute Jews so they'll go be the slaves of the Zionists.
[01:42:38.553 --> 01:42:40.654]  But people don't want to hear the truth on the show.
[01:42:40.915 --> 01:42:42.676]  They just want to bash Jews all day.
[01:42:43.856 --> 01:42:45.257]  You see, we're fighting toll roads.
[01:42:45.537 --> 01:42:50.861]  No matter what color you are, we don't want you to have a transponder taxing you thousands of dollars a year and tracking everything you do.
[01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:58.775]  We don't want you to drink aspartame, whether you're black or white or Jewish, because it eats holes in your brain.
[01:42:58.815 --> 01:43:01.917]  The government's own documents show when they tested it back in the 70s.
[01:43:02.418 --> 01:43:03.558]  Then Rumsfeld got it approved.
[01:43:03.939 --> 01:43:07.481]  You see, we don't like the chemtrails because it's bad for everybody.
[01:43:07.802 --> 01:43:13.426]  We don't like all of this stuff, and we're against genetic engineering because it screws up all of our futures.
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:20.862]  And see, all these losers who can't make it and don't have big audiences, they've all been set right up against us.
[01:43:20.902 --> 01:43:28.604]  These other networks, other people, they've all been set right up against us, many of them provocateurs, and they wonder why they fail and why they can't succeed.
[01:43:28.844 --> 01:43:33.806]  Because people don't tune in to radio shows to hear the word Jew 500 times an hour.
[01:43:34.266 --> 01:43:37.607]  They tune in to radio to hear analysis and information.
[01:43:38.653 --> 01:43:43.974]  And there's a lot of astute listeners who watch people and listen to people for years before they even make their mind up about it.
[01:43:44.214 --> 01:43:55.376]  And people decided this show has a track record, this broadcast has a track record, despite all my bombastic obnoxiousness, of being accurate and insightful, and we are the same today, yesterday, and tomorrow.
[01:43:56.536 --> 01:43:57.277]  We're for freedom.
[01:43:58.057 --> 01:43:58.597]  Period.
[01:43:58.817 --> 01:44:00.097]  Put it in your pipe and smoke it.
[01:44:01.017 --> 01:44:04.398]  And I just think about this, and I think about these idiots persecute me.
[01:44:05.319 --> 01:44:06.279]  And lie about me.
[01:44:06.299 --> 01:44:07.940]  And just make up stuff.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:08.480]  It's incredible.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:12.601]  You think if somebody's going to make something up, they use a little bit of truth in it.
[01:44:13.401 --> 01:44:14.181]  No, no.
[01:44:14.441 --> 01:44:19.463]  They just, out of whole cloth, bear false witness against me all over the place.
[01:44:19.823 --> 01:44:21.203]  Just total lies.
[01:44:21.283 --> 01:44:24.004]  Just total manufactured everything.
[01:44:24.044 --> 01:44:25.904]  And half this stuff is a total lie.
[01:44:25.924 --> 01:44:27.965]  And the other half is like a mix of truth and lies.
[01:44:28.245 --> 01:44:29.445]  Which is even more sneaky.
[01:44:29.485 --> 01:44:32.166]  But when you see stuff that's just all lies.
[01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:33.306]  All lies.
[01:44:35.313 --> 01:44:36.173]  What do you say to that?
[01:44:36.213 --> 01:44:37.054]  How do you respond?
[01:44:37.094 --> 01:44:37.994]  I don't have to.
[01:44:38.114 --> 01:44:38.974]  See, I've learned.
[01:44:39.314 --> 01:44:40.775]  These idiots think they're hurting us.
[01:44:40.835 --> 01:44:41.155]  No!
[01:44:41.515 --> 01:44:42.175]  And they're so dumb.
[01:44:42.215 --> 01:44:43.595]  I say this and they don't think it's serious.
[01:44:43.775 --> 01:44:45.196]  They think it's reverse psychology.
[01:44:45.916 --> 01:44:47.236]  No, I mean it.
[01:44:47.656 --> 01:44:48.337]  Keep it coming.
[01:44:49.457 --> 01:44:51.217]  Keep sending me all your listeners.
[01:44:51.537 --> 01:44:53.338]  Keep sending them all right here.
[01:44:54.153 --> 01:44:58.336]  Where they're going to learn the truth and where we can maybe save this society and this civilization.
[01:44:58.677 --> 01:44:59.958]  You know, I have instant message.
[01:44:59.978 --> 01:45:01.839]  I have internal chat room.
[01:45:01.939 --> 01:45:02.780]  I never use it.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.022]  I've started to use my instant message.
[01:45:05.042 --> 01:45:06.763]  We'll take some of your questions from instant message.
[01:45:08.144 --> 01:45:13.888]  But the reason I bring that up is because I had all my callers here written on a piece of paper.
[01:45:13.908 --> 01:45:14.789]  That's how I like to do it.
[01:45:14.829 --> 01:45:18.212]  The folks up in Minnesota tell me over the line who my callers are.
[01:45:18.252 --> 01:45:19.513]  Now I can't find the sheet.
[01:45:20.453 --> 01:45:23.957]  Because I'm a little bit foolish, and I start throwing papers around when I'm in here.
[01:45:24.558 --> 01:45:26.520]  Can you just tell me the next two callers?
[01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:27.882]  I don't have to do this over and over again.
[01:45:27.902 --> 01:45:30.545]  All right, Tom and San Fran.
[01:45:32.395 --> 01:45:33.616]  That should be enough until we have a break.
[01:45:34.176 --> 01:45:36.917]  Okay, Tom and San Fran, thanks for holding, sir.
[01:45:37.238 --> 01:45:38.358]  Hey, Alex, how's it going?
[01:45:38.658 --> 01:45:39.059]  Good.
[01:45:39.139 --> 01:45:40.339]  Thanks for your first guest.
[01:45:40.439 --> 01:45:46.263]  I was actually hoping I could get on and ask her a few questions, too, but I think you did a good job.
[01:45:46.743 --> 01:45:50.305]  She was disingenuous and hypocritical.
[01:45:50.545 --> 01:45:54.087]  I mean, she said Zundel's connected to terrorist groups, and so he deserves to be in there.
[01:45:54.307 --> 01:45:56.208]  Then she backtracked and changed what she said.
[01:45:56.548 --> 01:45:57.529]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:57.549 --> 01:45:59.772]  The whole time, she was going back and forth.
[01:46:00.072 --> 01:46:05.037]  Oh, but here I am criticizing this lady and trying to get Irving out of prison.
[01:46:05.057 --> 01:46:06.318]  But, Steve, I'm still bad, though.
[01:46:06.358 --> 01:46:07.400]  I'm still a Mossad agent.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.804]  Yeah, it's obviously very, you know, it's your Jewishness, right?
[01:46:13.286 --> 01:46:14.087]  Yes, exactly.
[01:46:14.147 --> 01:46:14.527]  Shalom.
[01:46:14.948 --> 01:46:18.712]  Anyway, but, yeah, I mean, I'm half Jewish myself, and I see, like, both sides of that.
[01:46:19.611 --> 01:46:25.053]  Yeah, I mean, the Jewish groups, the rabid Jewish groups want everybody to be anti-Semitic.
[01:46:25.594 --> 01:46:34.798]  I mean, seriously, they put the label on everybody, creating it, and then the other groups think everyone's an evil, you know, person because they're Jewish, or everyone's Jewish when they aren't Jewish.
[01:46:36.098 --> 01:46:36.779]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:46:36.899 --> 01:46:46.083]  Okay, well, on a different note to get off of that, I noticed that the 9-11 truth thing becomes, it seems to come in ways where, like, things start to break out, and then they kind of recede, and
[01:46:46.471 --> 01:46:47.853]  It seems to be another one happening now.
[01:46:47.873 --> 01:46:51.336]  I don't know if you heard Mike Malloy's show from last week on Air America.
[01:46:51.436 --> 01:47:02.468]  He basically came out ranting and, you know, saying all the, you know, talking about Project for a New American Century and just no question in his mind anymore that, you know, the Bush regime was involved in the
[01:47:03.414 --> 01:47:12.740]  Yeah, there's even a lot of people, now even some of the Coast to Coast AM folks that weren't in the camp with George Norrie and myself, believing in government involvement.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.344]  I mean, that was bold for George Norrie a couple years ago to start saying, yeah, I think it looks like they may have been involved.
[01:47:18.604 --> 01:47:21.005]  Now even some of the other Coast to Coast hosts are starting to say it.
[01:47:21.305 --> 01:47:24.968]  So, I mean, a lot of people, they had a big symposium, what, in Florida?
[01:47:25.008 --> 01:47:28.230]  I meant to cover that, where all these prominent people are going public.
[01:47:28.710 --> 01:47:31.171]  Is that, are you talking about in Utah, the Stephen Jones?
[01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:34.231]  No, there was another one there in Florida.
[01:47:34.851 --> 01:47:36.332]  There's so many, how do you keep track of them?
[01:47:36.752 --> 01:47:40.092]  Yeah, it's just, you know, I'm just glad to hear that.
[01:47:40.972 --> 01:47:43.973]  My final question is... Let's not talk about 9-11 and government involvement.
[01:47:44.613 --> 01:47:49.494]  Let's just, like, instead of saying a Hail Mary, let's just do a chant with the word Jew in it.
[01:47:49.794 --> 01:47:52.415]  Yeah, I know exactly which programs you're talking about.
[01:47:52.435 --> 01:47:52.555]  Yeah.
[01:47:54.697 --> 01:48:04.921]  On a final note, I don't expect that these people would actually maybe say all that, go that far with things, but I was wondering if you're ever considered trying to interview anyone like Stephen Colbert or Jon Stewart?
[01:48:05.781 --> 01:48:09.382]  Yes, I've tried to get Stewart on, and I've tried to get Colbert on.
[01:48:09.902 --> 01:48:12.583]  Both, really, I think are good guys going as far as they can.
[01:48:12.603 --> 01:48:16.925]  And I've been contacted by Comedy Central like three times in the last...
[01:48:17.637 --> 01:48:18.318]  Two years.
[01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:21.841]  And they always, they call and they go, hey, Alex, you live in New York, right?
[01:48:22.421 --> 01:48:22.722]  Come in here.
[01:48:22.742 --> 01:48:24.303]  We're going to have you live in studio today.
[01:48:24.363 --> 01:48:26.365]  And I go, this happened all three times.
[01:48:26.725 --> 01:48:28.447]  And I go, no, I do not live in New York.
[01:48:28.487 --> 01:48:29.588]  Well, everybody says you live here.
[01:48:29.928 --> 01:48:31.490]  I guess because I've got a big following up there.
[01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:32.230]  And I'm like, no.
[01:48:32.250 --> 01:48:34.692]  And they go, okay, well, we'll fly you up here next month.
[01:48:35.253 --> 01:48:42.940]  Okay, I guess they're on such short notice that I've never been on the show, but I know Stuart is aware of my work because I've been told that by his producers.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.121]  So Stuart has seen my videos.
[01:48:45.321 --> 01:48:51.025]  Sometimes I'll hear him talk about things the same day that I heard you talk about in the morning, like in the same manner.
[01:48:51.325 --> 01:48:52.986]  No, no, a bunch of their producers do listen.
[01:48:53.347 --> 01:48:54.367]  So say hi to them right now.
[01:48:55.108 --> 01:48:56.329]  Hey, let's say hello to the NFL.
[01:48:56.349 --> 01:48:59.971]  Look, I don't like to toot our horn because, frankly, I don't want to make it a cult of personality.
[01:49:00.291 --> 01:49:01.132]  It is not about me.
[01:49:01.152 --> 01:49:02.212]  It's about all of you guys.
[01:49:02.493 --> 01:49:05.314]  And I think that's great that let's toot our horn.
[01:49:05.615 --> 01:49:07.616]  I don't know if they're copying us, but they admit they listen.
[01:49:07.936 --> 01:49:13.900]  No, they do it in a subtextual way where they can get away with saying certain things and they make it like it's a joke, but it's not a joke.
[01:49:14.301 --> 01:49:17.383]  Well, that was pure genius how, because I hadn't pointed that out.
[01:49:17.403 --> 01:49:18.343]  I mean, they figured it out.
[01:49:18.584 --> 01:49:24.228]  They go, why is Oprah talking about, why is the media talking about how we've been lied to about a stupid book, a million little pieces?
[01:49:24.508 --> 01:49:27.029]  Why not talk about the real lies by our government?
[01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:31.853]  You see, they're giving us something petty that doesn't matter and doesn't affect any elites.
[01:49:33.468 --> 01:49:34.149]  Good to hear from you.
[01:49:34.169 --> 01:49:34.989]  I appreciate it.
[01:49:35.049 --> 01:49:37.190]  Clint and many others will continue with your calls.
[01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:39.351]  Wide open phones, and there's so much other news.
[01:49:39.692 --> 01:49:40.912]  A bunch of audio clips.
[01:49:41.433 --> 01:49:42.633]  We are on a roll today.
[01:49:42.713 --> 01:49:45.015]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com.
[01:49:45.535 --> 01:49:49.257]  I'm kind of overheating here, so I'm going to settle down and try to come back in a focused manner.
[01:49:49.277 --> 01:49:49.677]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.322]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.115 --> 01:49:58.736]  We're good to go.
[01:50:14.316 --> 01:50:19.198]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.458 --> 01:50:24.080]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:30.442]  Proofs on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.482 --> 01:50:32.323]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:50:50.531 --> 01:50:52.632]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[01:51:19.035 --> 01:51:30.838]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.298 --> 01:51:35.759]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:53:09.172 --> 01:53:10.833]  Alright, let's go back to the call.
[01:53:10.873 --> 01:53:12.273]  Clint, you're on the air.
[01:53:12.333 --> 01:53:14.194]  Welcome.
[01:53:14.214 --> 01:53:18.035]  Good morning.
[01:53:18.495 --> 01:53:19.236]  Good morning, Clint.
[01:53:19.276 --> 01:53:19.656]  Go ahead.
[01:53:19.676 --> 01:53:20.516]  We're on the radio.
[01:53:20.836 --> 01:53:28.979]  I'm from Metro Milwaukee, and I have some very informative things, a question that relates to your guest, Eisenhower himself.
[01:53:29.659 --> 01:53:35.201]  Now, I haven't acquired confirmation about what I'm going to say.
[01:53:35.221 --> 01:53:37.582]  I did send this man an email asking him,
[01:53:38.177 --> 01:53:39.518]  His name is Richard Lynn.
[01:53:39.558 --> 01:53:42.981]  He's a professor emeritus from the University of Ulster.
[01:53:44.583 --> 01:53:54.912]  The assertion is that he stated somewhere in writing, and I copied this out of some newsletter, that he said that he reviewed Eisenhower's Crusade in Europe, which is a book of 559 pages.
[01:53:57.114 --> 01:54:02.879]  Six volumes of Churchill's Second World War, which totals 4,448 pages.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.701]  Okay, you're giving us the bibliography.
[01:54:04.741 --> 01:54:05.742]  Why don't you give us the info?
[01:54:05.962 --> 01:54:06.482]  I'll get to it.
[01:54:06.623 --> 01:54:12.968]  And de Gaulle's three-volume memoirs, the Guare, Memoirs of War, which is 2,054 pages.
[01:54:13.449 --> 01:54:23.918]  Now, this Professor Emeritus, who is mostly well-known for his scholarly work in intelligence of races, he stated that not one
[01:54:24.739 --> 01:54:32.425]  No mention of Nazi gas chambers, no genocide of the Jews, or no six million Jewish victims in any of those seminal works.
[01:54:32.745 --> 01:54:34.246]  I thought you should be aware of that.
[01:54:34.387 --> 01:54:37.989]  I wanted to pose that to your guest, but bad timing.
[01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.630]  I understand.
[01:54:38.650 --> 01:54:48.397]  We had the professor on who, when David Irving, the alternative historian, revisionist as they call him, sued her for libel, she went to a British court.
[01:54:48.597 --> 01:54:49.118]  Yeah, Irving.
[01:54:49.578 --> 01:54:50.419]  Yeah, David Irvin.
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:53.642]  And he lost.
[01:54:54.203 --> 01:54:56.345]  I had her on about free speech, though.
[01:54:56.825 --> 01:54:59.688]  I'm not debating whether what Irvin said is true or not.
[01:55:00.228 --> 01:55:05.093]  I'm saying he doesn't deserve to be in an Austrian prison for three months.
[01:55:05.373 --> 01:55:06.154]  Oh, I couldn't agree more.
[01:55:06.194 --> 01:55:14.381]  Not even allowed to defend himself, so what's Europe running around saying, we've got free speech to put a picture of Muhammad or a caricature of Muhammad in there?
[01:55:14.641 --> 01:55:15.822]  It's just all a red herring.
[01:55:16.082 --> 01:55:16.863]  Couldn't agree more.
[01:55:17.123 --> 01:55:24.009]  And I'm saying, if you want a true scholar, a genuine scholar with a global reputation...
[01:55:24.677 --> 01:55:25.739]  Ask your friend in Britain.
[01:55:25.759 --> 01:55:27.601]  I'm sorry I don't recall his name right now.
[01:55:27.661 --> 01:55:32.408]  Have him contact Richard Lynn, Professor Emeritus, University of Ulster.
[01:55:32.788 --> 01:55:33.289]  Okay.
[01:55:33.850 --> 01:55:35.191]  We've got Yahoo Instant Message.
[01:55:35.211 --> 01:55:36.513]  We get a lot of tips from the listeners.
[01:55:36.553 --> 01:55:40.579]  Somebody send me that, and I'll be glad to, boy, get into that ball of wax.
[01:55:41.119 --> 01:55:48.822]  The question is, will I be arrested if I have a guest on that says 6,500,000 Jews died?
[01:55:48.842 --> 01:55:50.542]  If they say more died, will you be arrested?
[01:55:50.722 --> 01:55:54.163]  Because there's a German law, I've read it, you have to say 6 million exactly.
[01:55:54.604 --> 01:55:57.124]  Will I be arrested if I say under that amount died?
[01:55:57.625 --> 01:56:09.629]  You see, we know Hitler, I mean, I believe Hitler was bad, did kill a bunch of people and was a national socialist, but doesn't it almost then legitimize things when people go to jail for engaging in free speech?
[01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:10.309]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:11.172 --> 01:56:11.772]  It's amazing.
[01:56:12.912 --> 01:56:15.653]  Because if you don't believe in all free speech, you don't believe in any of it.
[01:56:17.113 --> 01:56:18.993]  And that's the point I'm making here.
[01:56:19.374 --> 01:56:23.194]  When we come back, I promise we'll go right back to your calls.
[01:56:23.214 --> 01:56:23.574]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:56:23.874 --> 01:56:27.755]  Wow, the callers are actually calling in on a topic I've raised.
[01:56:28.095 --> 01:56:29.335]  I'm talking about free speech, period.
[01:56:29.355 --> 01:56:37.897]  What about this lady up in Connecticut where the people at the drive-thru window, she supposedly said the N-word to them.
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:39.420]  Allegedly.
[01:56:39.981 --> 01:56:42.162]  And she and her boyfriend were arrested.
[01:56:43.583 --> 01:56:52.488]  Now, folks, again, when a black person or Hispanic says something racist to me, I don't freak out and then hate all blacks or hate all Hispanics.
[01:56:54.128 --> 01:57:04.194]  But somehow, out there in the press, people just think that all whites don't like other groups of people.
[01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:09.766]  Regardless, folks, I believe that this lady has the right to call somebody the N-word.
[01:57:10.846 --> 01:57:15.208]  Then I think their manager has a right to say, we're not going to serve rude people like you.
[01:57:16.568 --> 01:57:19.729]  Move on down the street, because it's a private establishment.
[01:57:20.449 --> 01:57:27.772]  But, I don't know, if this continues, I'm going to go out on the street and I'm going to, with a bullhorn, say every racist word there is in the dictionary.
[01:57:28.612 --> 01:57:31.353]  Not because I enjoy it, but because it's the First Amendment.
[01:57:33.407 --> 01:57:33.828]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.042 --> 01:57:52.103]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.803 --> 01:57:53.964]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.584 --> 01:57:55.405]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.145 --> 01:57:57.046]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.066 --> 01:58:01.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.889 --> 01:58:06.032]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.132 --> 01:58:14.117]  Wow, the first two hours just exploded.
[01:58:15.178 --> 01:58:16.559]  Raged past us.
[01:58:18.087 --> 01:58:19.268]  Stormed past us.
[01:58:19.728 --> 01:58:21.230]  Blitzed past us.
[01:58:22.671 --> 01:58:25.413]  And we're going to have wide open phones in this third hour.
[01:58:25.433 --> 01:58:32.118]  And I want to get into the propaganda of TV mirroring the propaganda of the government.
[01:58:32.178 --> 01:58:34.700]  Latest thing out from Chicago Tribune.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.121]  Group airs out on 24.
[01:58:37.913 --> 01:58:40.055]  Hoping to influence debate on Patriot Act.
[01:58:40.215 --> 01:58:40.735]  Sinister.
[01:58:40.755 --> 01:58:44.097]  And I have an audio clip that goes with this ABC News piece I want to analyze.
[01:58:44.277 --> 01:58:47.940]  iScan technology comes to schools and a lot more.
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:49.281]  But we've been talking about free speech.
[01:58:49.301 --> 01:58:49.861]  I mean, here it is.
[01:58:50.161 --> 01:58:50.642]  Connecticut.
[01:58:50.662 --> 01:58:57.867]  A woman accused of using racial epithet while waiting for food at Connecticut Taco Bell drive-thru window was arrested last Wednesday.
[01:58:58.007 --> 01:58:59.608]  I meant to cover this Friday when I saw it.
[01:59:00.248 --> 01:59:00.689]  Never did.
[01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:02.750]  And I've since looked it up.
[01:59:02.810 --> 01:59:03.751]  And yeah, they're charging her.
[01:59:04.331 --> 01:59:06.052]  She's going to serve some jail time, it looks like.
[01:59:06.112 --> 01:59:06.993]  Serious crimes here.
[01:59:08.681 --> 01:59:09.441]  By doing that.
[01:59:09.461 --> 01:59:10.682]  I mean, do we have free speech?
[01:59:12.183 --> 01:59:14.084]  And I don't want to hear, well, it's a mean word.
[01:59:14.144 --> 01:59:15.705]  Well, that's too bad.
[01:59:16.925 --> 01:59:19.367]  Believe me, I've had plenty of racist stuff said to me.
[01:59:19.387 --> 01:59:27.971]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, where most of the black folks are real nice, but the majority there in Dallas, or is it 50-50, is black.
[01:59:28.031 --> 01:59:36.356]  And I mean, so when you're the minority, and there's some racist blacks, folks, I don't run around going, arrest them, arrest them, as long as it doesn't get physical.
[01:59:37.518 --> 01:59:38.018]  That's fine.
[01:59:38.078 --> 01:59:38.879]  Call me whatever you want.
[01:59:39.219 --> 01:59:42.701]  Sticks and stones can break my bones and words will never hurt me.
[01:59:42.721 --> 01:59:45.302]  And there were a few times I had racist blacks physically attack me.
[01:59:45.322 --> 01:59:45.863]  And you know what?
[01:59:46.663 --> 01:59:47.764]  I just had to defend myself.
[01:59:47.784 --> 01:59:50.105]  And then I had rednecks who didn't like me coming around.
[01:59:50.125 --> 01:59:52.426]  This is our bonfire, boy.
[01:59:52.446 --> 01:59:55.388]  Don't you be trying to pick up my girl.
[01:59:56.248 --> 01:59:56.848]  It's the same thing.
[01:59:56.908 --> 01:59:58.109]  It's tribalism.
[01:59:58.869 --> 02:00:03.372]  That redneck didn't like what I was doing because it was his ex-girlfriend I was talking to.
[02:00:04.566 --> 02:00:09.487]  And it's the same way that those black guys didn't like somebody in their restaurant or whatever.
[02:00:10.787 --> 02:00:19.009]  So instead of letting the government play us off against each other, and the government's the arbiter of everything, we need to realize who the real threat is, who's really controlling our lives.
[02:00:19.329 --> 02:00:21.490]  It's the government and the corporations that control it.
[02:00:22.770 --> 02:00:27.331]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:00:28.403 --> 02:00:30.447]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Kansas City.
[02:00:30.487 --> 02:00:31.168]  Don, go ahead.
[02:00:31.208 --> 02:00:31.549]  Welcome.
[02:00:32.050 --> 02:00:34.273]  Hey, Alex, three things quick.
[02:00:34.353 --> 02:00:38.080]  Number one, if you get on the Daily Show, that would be a real leap forward.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:39.262]  That would be a really great thing.
[02:00:40.621 --> 02:00:44.763]  I mean, they're mainly newsmakers, though, and so if they can get some big guest on, that's what they're going to do.
[02:00:44.783 --> 02:00:48.004]  But yeah, I know they've called me like three times, and they've said, you live in New York.
[02:00:48.264 --> 02:00:50.664]  Again, they still have me somehow in a database living in New York.
[02:00:50.684 --> 02:00:51.385]  I've never lived there.
[02:00:51.865 --> 02:00:53.805]  And they say, if you'll come down right now, we want you on.
[02:00:54.426 --> 02:00:58.827]  And I'm like, three hours before showtime, I go, I can try to get on a plane.
[02:00:59.747 --> 02:01:01.928]  But yeah, no, tell them to have me on, sure.
[02:01:03.081 --> 02:01:10.547]  Yeah, and number two, I was thinking of calling you today and asking about the possibility that Europe is behind these Muslim riots.
[02:01:10.567 --> 02:01:15.451]  I mean, their boy Albert Pike said three world wars and they could bring in their precious world government.
[02:01:15.471 --> 02:01:16.712]  Well, we just went over evidence.
[02:01:16.792 --> 02:01:18.013]  It's not just us saying it.
[02:01:18.033 --> 02:01:20.294]  The London Telegraph is saying it's suspicious.
[02:01:20.655 --> 02:01:21.215]  Absolutely.
[02:01:21.856 --> 02:01:27.500]  Number three, I read an online book called, I think, American Babylon by a guy named Peter Goodgame.
[02:01:28.181 --> 02:01:30.482]  He has a website called redmoonrising.com.
[02:01:31.792 --> 02:01:41.376]  Really interesting guy, kind of like a Webster Tarpley kind of guy, and he had a really interesting thesis about FDR during the war.
[02:01:41.456 --> 02:01:54.621]  He said that FDR during the war had this post-war vision of an alliance of nations of former colonies, just like the United States was, with an American-style constitution that would kind of navigate between the Soviet Union on the one hand,
[02:01:55.154 --> 02:01:56.935]  And the British Empire on the other.
[02:01:57.416 --> 02:02:01.979]  Sir, that was in the New York Times in 1937 with a world map.
[02:02:02.059 --> 02:02:04.500]  That is the Cecil Rhodes globalist model.
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:05.901]  That is the New World Order.
[02:02:06.362 --> 02:02:06.842]  Oh, really?
[02:02:06.962 --> 02:02:07.803]  That's public, yeah.
[02:02:07.823 --> 02:02:18.870]  It's the British Commonwealth of 20-something countries, with America only having one vote in it, along with another bipolar New World Order with Russia and China, all owned and financed by the same bankers.
[02:02:19.391 --> 02:02:22.813]  Well, the elites of the East Coast of America are Tories anyhow.
[02:02:22.853 --> 02:02:24.454]  They're very much in the same hearts.
[02:02:25.534 --> 02:02:26.995]  They're British counterparts.
[02:02:27.015 --> 02:02:28.295]  They have Atlantic accents.
[02:02:28.495 --> 02:02:29.375]  They fox hunt.
[02:02:30.096 --> 02:02:31.896]  Hey, anything else you want to add?
[02:02:32.636 --> 02:02:33.497]  No, that's all.
[02:02:34.237 --> 02:02:34.797]  Great call.
[02:02:34.837 --> 02:02:35.897]  Good to hear from you, brother.
[02:02:36.577 --> 02:02:38.598]  David, Bill, Russell, Alex, many others.
[02:02:38.618 --> 02:02:39.538]  Your calls are straight ahead.

[02:02:46.556 --> 02:02:49.418]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.679 --> 02:02:50.379]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.459 --> 02:02:51.240]  Alex Jones here.

[02:02:56.604 --> 02:03:03.350]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.670 --> 02:03:05.652]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.852 --> 02:03:08.694]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.795 --> 02:03:13.459]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.659 --> 02:03:18.043]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.303 --> 02:03:25.529]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:51.654]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.994 --> 02:03:56.078]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.378 --> 02:03:56.919]  We listened.
[02:03:57.239 --> 02:04:02.203]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.484 --> 02:04:02.984]  We listened.
[02:04:03.364 --> 02:04:06.407]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.827 --> 02:04:07.348]  We listened.
[02:04:07.808 --> 02:04:11.872]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:04:12.252 --> 02:04:12.753]  We listened.
[02:04:13.093 --> 02:04:18.318]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:04:18.738 --> 02:04:20.100]  Again, we listened.
[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:27.847]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:31.690]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[02:04:37.295 --> 02:04:38.037]  We're good to go.
[02:04:38.177 --> 02:04:39.040]  We're good to go.
[02:04:46.135 --> 02:04:50.217]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[02:05:12.406 --> 02:05:12.806]  We're good to go.
[02:05:43.829 --> 02:05:44.509]  888-216-2461.
[02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:50.231]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.591 --> 02:05:52.912]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.272 --> 02:05:59.494]  All right, now into the second segment of the third hour.
[02:05:59.514 --> 02:05:59.795]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:00.275 --> 02:06:01.755]  Your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[02:06:01.775 --> 02:06:09.078]  And then I'm going to get into Group Air's ad on 24, the TV show, hoping to influence debate on Patriot Act.
[02:06:10.507 --> 02:06:13.109]  You see, the general public thinks TV's real now.
[02:06:13.809 --> 02:06:14.150]  They do.
[02:06:14.930 --> 02:06:18.312]  They may not consciously, but subconsciously, they've done the brain scans.
[02:06:18.352 --> 02:06:20.274]  They are absorbing it as if it is real.
[02:06:20.654 --> 02:06:21.394]  So we'll get into that.
[02:06:22.855 --> 02:06:24.497]  And I've also got some comments on the Super Bowl.
[02:06:24.537 --> 02:06:26.578]  Yes, of all things, comments on the Super Bowl.
[02:06:27.018 --> 02:06:27.779]  So stay with us.
[02:06:28.939 --> 02:06:30.320]  Then there's a smattering of other news.
[02:06:31.561 --> 02:06:34.103]  Let me just now tell you about a great sponsor.
[02:06:34.123 --> 02:06:38.366]  This hour is brought to you by the Calvin Pure Soap Company.
[02:06:39.250 --> 02:06:41.692]  And I cannot say enough about these guys.
[02:06:42.953 --> 02:06:43.693]  Let me just ask you this.
[02:06:43.733 --> 02:06:45.655]  When was the last time you used Pure Soap?
[02:06:45.715 --> 02:06:46.395]  You've heard the ad.
[02:06:46.415 --> 02:06:47.676]  I mean, real hard to find.
[02:06:47.736 --> 02:06:54.881]  All-natural Pure Soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, chlorides, glycerins, lanolens, vitamins, antibacterials.
[02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:56.222]  Probably never, right?
[02:06:56.702 --> 02:07:00.485]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past, now, what is it, 59 years,
[02:07:02.306 --> 02:07:09.228]  59 years, very fly-by-night, has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:07:09.248 --> 02:07:13.830]  Now, for the first time, Calvin Pure Soap is available factory-direct to you and your family.
[02:07:14.290 --> 02:07:17.871]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[02:07:18.191 --> 02:07:20.352]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[02:07:20.672 --> 02:07:24.573]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:07:24.953 --> 02:07:25.993]  It is roughly, what did he say, 85% off.
[02:07:32.472 --> 02:07:34.333]  Supermarket cost.
[02:07:34.834 --> 02:07:37.896]  And believe me, we got a year's supply from him like two years ago.
[02:07:37.916 --> 02:07:40.858]  Because he's been sponsoring the network forever, like five years.
[02:07:41.398 --> 02:07:42.178]  Genesis Network.
[02:07:43.639 --> 02:07:45.140]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[02:07:45.441 --> 02:07:50.924]  But he sent us a year's supply because he sent some of the other folks to the network to add it.
[02:07:50.944 --> 02:07:54.106]  And my wife, like two years later, a year and a half later, goes, I want more of this.
[02:07:54.126 --> 02:07:54.667]  Where'd you get it?
[02:07:54.707 --> 02:07:55.147]  Get me more.
[02:07:55.711 --> 02:07:58.233]  And then she ordered some more, and then she said, why don't you get them as a sponsor?
[02:07:58.253 --> 02:08:00.295]  I'm like, yeah, why don't I get them to sponsor my show?
[02:08:00.655 --> 02:08:03.298]  Because I literally turn down sponsors every day.
[02:08:04.059 --> 02:08:08.483]  It's ridiculous, because if I haven't proven it or don't believe it, I won't plug it myself.
[02:08:09.183 --> 02:08:11.265]  And it's just, you save so much money.
[02:08:11.285 --> 02:08:21.174]  You can buy comparable organic stuff made out of fruits and vegetables, and it works great at the local health food store, but that stuff costs more than the toxic chemical stuff.
[02:08:21.829 --> 02:08:22.610]  We're good to go.
[02:08:22.670 --> 02:08:23.191]  We're good to go.
[02:08:23.251 --> 02:08:23.671]  We're good to go.
[02:08:39.213 --> 02:08:39.713]  We're good to go.
[02:09:05.712 --> 02:09:10.776]  And you ought to see all the... I was talking to Marty, the owner, whose dad started it back in 1947.
[02:09:10.916 --> 02:09:14.058]  It's the rich people.
[02:09:14.158 --> 02:09:15.519]  It's the scientists.
[02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:19.462]  It's the well-to-do that have been ordering their soap in hospitals and other people.
[02:09:20.163 --> 02:09:22.784]  People who have allergies and get rashes from the chemicals.
[02:09:23.785 --> 02:09:26.787]  And it's still family-owned, and you can get it factory-direct, 1-800-340-7091.
[02:09:26.807 --> 02:09:27.748]  Calbin at PureSoap.com.
[02:09:27.768 --> 02:09:31.231]  Well, there's a banner on the left-hand side of InfoWars.com.
[02:09:35.293 --> 02:09:38.796]  When you're on InfoWars.com, it's on the left-hand side down there near the bottom.
[02:09:39.056 --> 02:09:41.358]  You'll see a banner for Cal Ben Pearsop.
[02:09:41.398 --> 02:09:44.901]  C-A-L-B-E-N Pearsop.com.
[02:09:45.181 --> 02:09:49.084]  Or 1-800-340-7091, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:49.164 --> 02:09:49.565]  All right.
[02:09:51.726 --> 02:09:53.107]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:09:53.208 --> 02:09:55.710]  Let's talk to David in Minnesota.
[02:09:55.730 --> 02:09:56.510]  How are you doing, David?
[02:09:56.530 --> 02:09:57.511]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:09:57.591 --> 02:09:59.032]  Thanks very much for having me on today.
[02:09:59.212 --> 02:09:59.953]  Thank you for calling.
[02:09:59.973 --> 02:10:02.235]  You know, people always thank talk shows for having them on.
[02:10:02.275 --> 02:10:03.156]  I thank you for calling.
[02:10:03.536 --> 02:10:04.837]  I have two points to make today.
[02:10:05.459 --> 02:10:16.644]  One is, whenever I hear somebody talking about lineage and pedigree in a spiritual context, that raises a red flag for me, because we know we are who we are by grace and not by race.
[02:10:18.745 --> 02:10:19.445]  I agree with you.
[02:10:19.505 --> 02:10:22.386]  Now, of course, probably the death threats will start flowing now, but so what?
[02:10:22.746 --> 02:10:23.267]  That's okay.
[02:10:23.907 --> 02:10:26.908]  You've always been one to proclaim the truth, and I think that's really our only option.
[02:10:27.888 --> 02:10:31.250]  My second point is, when you talk about freedom of speech...
[02:10:31.934 --> 02:10:32.754]  Yes, that's how they rule.
[02:10:32.834 --> 02:10:32.994]  Yes.
[02:11:01.690 --> 02:11:02.951]  He's not really a God, is he?
[02:11:03.491 --> 02:11:05.633]  Well, no, but I mean, I don't think God needs it.
[02:11:05.653 --> 02:11:06.394]  I think you should.
[02:11:06.414 --> 02:11:08.315]  Oh, I agree that God doesn't need you to.
[02:11:08.735 --> 02:11:09.936]  I'm just saying I think you should.
[02:11:10.297 --> 02:11:18.903]  Well, I'm just saying if somebody is ignorant enough to demean the Bible or to say they destroyed the Bible and trying to get me fired up, it's not going to work.
[02:11:19.023 --> 02:11:23.187]  Oh, yeah, they'll tear Bibles up to get the government to pass free speech laws that restrict free speech.
[02:11:23.687 --> 02:11:26.469]  And the government's cynically doing that just to restrict all speech.
[02:11:27.070 --> 02:11:27.530]  Exactly.
[02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:31.333]  And I'm not going to go out there and have a confrontation with somebody who's destroying a Bible.
[02:11:31.741 --> 02:11:34.182]  To defend that, because God doesn't need me to do that.
[02:11:34.422 --> 02:11:37.604]  No, I hear you, and I really appreciate your call and the fine points you made.
[02:11:38.204 --> 02:11:39.284]  David, please call again.
[02:11:39.304 --> 02:11:43.246]  I don't claim to be the ultimate Bible scholar.
[02:11:43.646 --> 02:11:50.349]  I mean, I sat through probably more than a decade of Sunday school, Baptist Sunday school, and believe me, I liked it.
[02:11:52.650 --> 02:11:54.251]  I should say Baptist style.
[02:11:54.271 --> 02:11:56.532]  I went to Baptist churches, too, but a lot of it was non-denominational.
[02:11:57.503 --> 02:12:01.345]  And I have watched a lot of programs about the Bible, and I've listened to the Bible on tape, driving places.
[02:12:01.846 --> 02:12:07.449]  You know, I'm not really good at all the verses and everything, but I think there's a lot of great knowledge and information there.
[02:12:08.029 --> 02:12:09.971]  And I think it is something that more people should research.
[02:12:10.991 --> 02:12:12.892]  But a lot of it is taken out of context.
[02:12:12.912 --> 02:12:14.213]  People lie about what's in it.
[02:12:15.054 --> 02:12:17.955]  But one time, you know, I'm here in Austin in the networks of Minnesota.
[02:12:18.356 --> 02:12:20.417]  One time they were talking to me in my headset.
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.784]  The network was, while a caller was talking, they'll pop in and say, Bob hung up, or your guest is ready.
[02:12:26.804 --> 02:12:33.509]  And I don't remember exactly what it was, but the board I popped in and said, blah, blah, blah, and the caller said, do you know that verse?
[02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:35.251]  And I said, no, repeat it.
[02:12:35.271 --> 02:12:40.334]  Instead of saying, no, they were talking to me in my ear, because then I have to do that whole elaborate...
[02:12:42.705 --> 02:12:43.186]  We're good to go.
[02:13:07.791 --> 02:13:10.152]  Oh, then it was a big news article.
[02:13:10.272 --> 02:13:12.413]  Alex Jones doesn't know John 3.16.
[02:13:12.573 --> 02:13:15.014]  Well, of course I know it.
[02:13:15.635 --> 02:13:18.176]  But I do know this.
[02:13:18.276 --> 02:13:20.037]  I could go pull the verses and pull it.
[02:13:20.117 --> 02:13:31.562]  I don't like to get into this stuff because I have a news show, and the whole broadcast will turn into a big debate and a big fight because there's 10,000 sects out there of Christianity alone.
[02:13:31.602 --> 02:13:32.302]  So I'm not doing that.
[02:13:32.342 --> 02:13:34.863]  But whereas I believe everybody can be saved...
[02:13:35.892 --> 02:13:41.497]  There are certain groups or tribes or countries or groups of people that God curses.
[02:13:43.218 --> 02:13:51.504]  And there are civilizations, say Babylon, where you're so evil and fallen that you're going to be cursed for ten generations.
[02:13:51.584 --> 02:13:57.409]  Or Israel, you're going to be in bondage for thousands of years because you haven't done what I said and you're losing the birthright.
[02:13:57.789 --> 02:14:01.612]  And so now you're not special with me anymore.
[02:14:02.773 --> 02:14:04.274]  So there is examples of that.
[02:14:05.724 --> 02:14:08.566]  You know, God saying, you're the apple of my eye to a particular group.
[02:14:09.507 --> 02:14:11.829]  Or I've used this group to punish you.
[02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:13.831]  I mean, certainly that stuff goes on.
[02:14:14.812 --> 02:14:17.395]  And people love race.
[02:14:17.415 --> 02:14:18.536]  They love tribalism.
[02:14:19.096 --> 02:14:20.618]  And it's like a breed of dog.
[02:14:20.658 --> 02:14:22.380]  They're all canine familiarists.
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:28.866]  They're all the same species, but different breeds do have different attributes and different shortcomings.
[02:14:29.226 --> 02:14:30.087]  Predominantly.
[02:14:31.073 --> 02:14:36.878]  I mean, you may find a Boston Terrier that follows direction and is good and isn't willful.
[02:14:37.879 --> 02:14:41.121]  I mean, they're great dogs, but the breed is known for being somewhat willful.
[02:14:41.402 --> 02:14:49.448]  Now, I've got a Boston Terrier that is not willful and people see it and know to have Boston Terriers and say, that's the best Boston Terrier I've ever seen.
[02:14:49.488 --> 02:14:50.389]  He's also the best looking.
[02:14:51.334 --> 02:14:55.437]  And he does get occasional kisses from my wife and I on the forehead.
[02:14:56.338 --> 02:14:58.440]  Side issue, sorry, I'm getting off on the dog now.
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:02.683]  But the Chihuahua my wife has is particularly horrible for the breed.
[02:15:02.803 --> 02:15:04.425]  And I'm being sarcastic somewhat.
[02:15:04.445 --> 02:15:06.947]  I like to tease the dog, but talk about how horrible it is.
[02:15:06.967 --> 02:15:09.829]  But in a way, it doesn't behave very well.
[02:15:10.149 --> 02:15:12.071]  It's kind of on the bad end of Chihuahuas.
[02:15:12.731 --> 02:15:20.718]  I mean, so to say that certain races or certain subgroups of Homo sapiens sapiens, you know, the dog is canine familiaris.
[02:15:22.679 --> 02:15:30.426]  And so there are subgroups of the races in humankind.
[02:15:30.486 --> 02:15:35.591]  So then, why is that taboo and off limits when it's well known that different races are different?
[02:15:35.891 --> 02:15:39.254]  Different subgroups of Africans are different from other African blacks.
[02:15:39.595 --> 02:15:42.537]  Different Asians are different from other Asians.
[02:15:43.118 --> 02:15:47.422]  I mean, even within the subgroups, there are subderivations of subderivations.
[02:15:48.172 --> 02:15:50.712]  And boy, now we're really going to go off to the races.
[02:15:51.113 --> 02:15:53.653]  And that's something I really have studied in real science.
[02:15:54.433 --> 02:15:55.473]  There are differences.
[02:15:56.413 --> 02:16:01.694]  But that is in generalities, you have to understand.
[02:16:02.394 --> 02:16:05.915]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to another caller.
[02:16:06.355 --> 02:16:07.795]  Bill in Toronto.
[02:16:07.835 --> 02:16:08.315]  You're on the air.
[02:16:08.355 --> 02:16:08.916]  Thanks for holding.
[02:16:09.536 --> 02:16:10.576]  Yes, how are you, Alex?
[02:16:10.856 --> 02:16:11.576]  Hello, my friend.
[02:16:11.616 --> 02:16:12.696]  Nice to hear your voice.
[02:16:12.896 --> 02:16:14.516]  You're a gentleman.
[02:16:15.897 --> 02:16:17.497]  I don't get called that very often, but go ahead.
[02:16:18.752 --> 02:16:27.294]  Well, I talked with many people like yourself in the past, and I admire your courage of speaking up in an unfreakable country like the United States.
[02:16:28.615 --> 02:16:47.379]  When I was in a Jesuit seminary back in Brazil before I get to graduate, when I mentioned to the Monsignor that two Christians do not worship idols and image, and you're talking about freedom of speech, Brother Alec, you should see his face, you should see the way they mistreated me for three long years.
[02:16:48.516 --> 02:16:52.059]  And they talking about freedom of speech on the Zionists?
[02:16:52.299 --> 02:16:53.721]  You know who the Zionists are?
[02:16:53.921 --> 02:16:56.763]  I did researches right from the Jesuit seminary.
[02:16:57.524 --> 02:16:58.024]  Guess what?
[02:16:58.485 --> 02:17:05.871]  The Jesuits and the Zionists and Catholics co-work together for the one world globalization.
[02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:08.613]  And they are all in the same.
[02:17:09.214 --> 02:17:13.417]  When they slaughter millions of German people, nobody says one word about this.
[02:17:13.817 --> 02:17:15.659]  I was born in Germany, in Frankfurt.
[02:17:16.365 --> 02:17:19.267]  My father was an officer in the German Army.
[02:17:19.287 --> 02:17:20.968]  Well, let me hear the story on the other side.
[02:17:21.048 --> 02:17:25.871]  Stay there, and then we'll go to Russell, Alex, and John.
[02:17:25.951 --> 02:17:26.992]  Maybe a few more after that.
[02:17:27.032 --> 02:17:30.374]  I've got to get into the big stack of amazing news here.
[02:17:30.394 --> 02:17:31.795]  It's all jam-packed today.
[02:17:31.996 --> 02:17:32.876]  I feel good today, though.
[02:17:32.896 --> 02:17:34.177]  We're covering most of the news.
[02:17:34.197 --> 02:17:35.698]  We're getting to a lot of calls at the same time.
[02:17:36.238 --> 02:17:38.280]  And I'm still getting to rant and vent a little bit.
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:39.200]  It's a nice mix.
[02:17:40.361 --> 02:17:41.662]  Stay there, Bill.
[02:17:41.722 --> 02:17:42.823]  We'll be right back with you, William.
[02:17:46.488 --> 02:17:47.208]  Listen up, folks.
[02:17:47.268 --> 02:17:48.489]  Did you know you've been cheated?
[02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:51.070]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.930]  You heard that right.
[02:17:52.010 --> 02:17:54.471]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:17:54.731 --> 02:17:55.792]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:17:55.932 --> 02:17:57.132]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:17:57.492 --> 02:17:58.893]  Now's the time to fight back.
[02:17:59.073 --> 02:18:01.494]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:18:01.774 --> 02:18:04.715]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.
[02:18:05.115 --> 02:18:06.436]  We have a better than 90% success rate.

[02:18:24.022 --> 02:18:24.502]  We're good to go.
[02:18:46.331 --> 02:18:50.718]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[02:18:51.158 --> 02:18:57.628]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[02:18:58.106 --> 02:19:00.247]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[02:19:00.667 --> 02:19:06.690]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[02:19:07.250 --> 02:19:26.578]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[02:20:45.484 --> 02:20:45.924]  Gold.
[02:20:46.265 --> 02:20:47.566]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:20:47.826 --> 02:20:53.911]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:20:54.092 --> 02:20:57.915]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:20:58.275 --> 02:21:00.157]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:21:00.197 --> 02:21:02.499]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:21:02.639 --> 02:21:08.504]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[02:21:08.524 --> 02:21:09.185]  We're good to go.
[02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:24.341]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.885 --> 02:21:53.910]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.510 --> 02:21:57.533]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:58.774 --> 02:22:08.081]  All right, let's go straight back to your calls and move quickly.
[02:22:09.662 --> 02:22:12.204]  Go ahead and finish up, Bill, in Toronto.
[02:22:12.244 --> 02:22:16.628]  You left off with you were in Germany, I guess you said during the war?
[02:22:17.307 --> 02:22:18.667]  Well, I was born in Germany.
[02:22:18.727 --> 02:22:22.728]  I was a young boy when we immigrated to Brazil in 1946.
[02:22:23.248 --> 02:22:25.089]  I was five years of age.
[02:22:25.249 --> 02:22:26.549]  The boys from Brazil, huh?
[02:22:26.629 --> 02:22:26.909]  Yes.
[02:22:27.329 --> 02:22:34.451]  And when I came to the seminary, my mother put me in the Jesuit seminary, Curitiba Parana.
[02:22:35.311 --> 02:22:38.011]  And I thought there is freedom from childhood.
[02:22:38.091 --> 02:22:41.412]  I thought there is certain language freedom or there are certain approaches.
[02:22:41.732 --> 02:22:44.893]  But I never seen Bible for years in the Jesuit seminary.
[02:22:44.973 --> 02:22:46.493]  Question is, why they conceal it?
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:49.362]  Then I did investigation of my own.
[02:22:50.043 --> 02:22:52.685]  What kind of books have been burning in Germany?
[02:22:52.745 --> 02:22:54.406]  Who was behind burning books?
[02:22:54.767 --> 02:22:56.468]  They were burning Bibles, brother.
[02:22:57.109 --> 02:23:02.653]  They were destroying Bibles because Bible is exposing the evil of the humanity.
[02:23:03.814 --> 02:23:05.136]  Religion is man-made.
[02:23:05.796 --> 02:23:07.758]  Men don't benefit from religion.
[02:23:07.838 --> 02:23:10.981]  Men benefit from worshipping God Almighty, the Creator.
[02:23:11.701 --> 02:23:12.602]  When I told that
[02:23:13.267 --> 02:23:17.030]  The most, you know, I say rosaries and crosses and nothing can save you.
[02:23:17.550 --> 02:23:19.091]  That's not symbol of salvation.
[02:23:19.151 --> 02:23:20.572]  That's symbol of deception.
[02:23:21.313 --> 02:23:23.114]  Jesus Christ is the Holy Savior.
[02:23:23.174 --> 02:23:27.577]  Jesus came to this planet and He brought the Holy Word of God to humanity.
[02:23:27.597 --> 02:23:28.978]  Humanity rejected.
[02:23:29.419 --> 02:23:32.541]  Humanity goes by symbol, idols and images.
[02:23:32.941 --> 02:23:34.262]  They worship mankind.
[02:23:34.843 --> 02:23:36.744]  They don't follow the teaching of Jesus.
[02:23:36.844 --> 02:23:40.707]  If they did follow the teaching of Jesus, we wouldn't be in a mess what we are now.
[02:23:42.049 --> 02:23:42.809]  We wouldn't be.
[02:23:43.210 --> 02:23:47.452]  Nobody talks about poor German people that were suffering by the hands of the Zionists.
[02:23:47.692 --> 02:23:48.892]  My mother was a Jewish.
[02:23:50.173 --> 02:23:51.013]  Orthodox Jewish.
[02:23:51.254 --> 02:23:54.555]  She told me, Zionism, Catholicism is one and the same.
[02:23:55.336 --> 02:23:59.358]  Just like you can have a Walmart and you can have Zellers under one ownership.
[02:23:59.678 --> 02:24:00.358]  Different names.
[02:24:01.359 --> 02:24:02.059]  It doesn't matter.
[02:24:02.579 --> 02:24:04.000]  Humans are blindfolded.
[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:06.541]  There are three words.
[02:24:06.981 --> 02:24:08.242]  Pay, pray and obey.
[02:24:08.965 --> 02:24:09.565]  Obey who?
[02:24:09.845 --> 02:24:10.726]  Obey the system?
[02:24:10.966 --> 02:24:11.586]  Pray for who?
[02:24:11.966 --> 02:24:12.566]  Pray to who?
[02:24:12.826 --> 02:24:13.867]  The God of this world?
[02:24:14.667 --> 02:24:15.387]  And pray to who?
[02:24:15.567 --> 02:24:17.588]  So they can use the money to dope you up?
[02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:22.750]  Man should be free from the bondage of slavery of religion.
[02:24:23.711 --> 02:24:26.452]  That kind of thing what happened with the Muslims.
[02:24:27.272 --> 02:24:32.934]  I have Muslim friends, I'm Jewish, but I tell you that have been planned to stir up
[02:24:34.439 --> 02:24:38.040]  The poor Muslims, they don't think that Muhammad is not the Savior.
[02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:39.241]  Muhammad is dead.
[02:24:39.261 --> 02:24:39.981]  He's in the grave.
[02:24:40.281 --> 02:24:41.381]  But Jesus is alive.
[02:24:42.402 --> 02:24:45.543]  All right, listen, I appreciate your call, and you can call back again.
[02:24:45.563 --> 02:24:49.624]  And I appreciate you sharing that information with us.
[02:24:50.164 --> 02:24:50.804]  I've got to move on.
[02:24:50.864 --> 02:24:52.845]  Another caller here, because I've got a bunch of news coming up.
[02:24:53.325 --> 02:24:54.765]  Russell in Florida.
[02:24:54.785 --> 02:24:55.446]  You're on the air.
[02:24:55.466 --> 02:24:55.906]  Go ahead.
[02:24:56.186 --> 02:24:57.866]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:57.926 --> 02:24:58.246]  You bet.
[02:24:58.506 --> 02:24:59.227]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:02.962]  Also, two things I wanted to mention today.
[02:25:03.142 --> 02:25:07.865]  One is thanks for posting that video made by the foreigner on police education in New York.
[02:25:08.025 --> 02:25:12.388]  I want to try to play that, some of it, where it's video of the cops.
[02:25:12.428 --> 02:25:16.230]  They come up, beat you up on video, and then say you assaulted them.
[02:25:16.671 --> 02:25:16.891]  Right.
[02:25:17.771 --> 02:25:20.253]  I sent that to you, and I think they posted it.
[02:25:20.373 --> 02:25:21.534]  It was very, very good.
[02:25:21.554 --> 02:25:23.435]  That's on Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[02:25:24.384 --> 02:25:37.073]  Alex, the reason for my call, and I wanted to call last week but I wasn't able to, is I'm a big fan of dystopian movies like DHX 1138, 1984, Soylent Green, Logan's Run, Rollerball, and Equilibrium, and movies like that.
[02:25:37.093 --> 02:25:39.575]  The Island, Serenity.
[02:25:39.815 --> 02:25:40.716]  Yep, good new one.
[02:25:41.316 --> 02:25:48.421]  One of the movies that I think hasn't been talked about, it's not a dystopian movie, but it's real good, starring Jim Carrey, is The Majestic.
[02:25:49.639 --> 02:25:50.700]  I haven't seen that yet.
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:54.581]  I haven't seen Spotless Mind.
[02:25:55.241 --> 02:26:02.343]  And the fun with Dick and Jane that he just did recently is real good where it highlights intimate corruption of government and business like Enron.
[02:26:02.423 --> 02:26:11.285]  As a matter of fact, they mention at the very end, thanks to all the CEOs and directors of all these companies, and they list all the companies and all the names like Kenway.
[02:26:12.106 --> 02:26:12.806]  Pretty good movie.
[02:26:13.206 --> 02:26:16.427]  But Majestic, if you haven't seen it, the end of it where
[02:26:17.065 --> 02:26:22.832]  The Senate has him and they're trying to grill him and he stands up and starts speaking for the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[02:26:24.942 --> 02:26:25.642]  I got an idea.
[02:26:25.662 --> 02:26:28.824]  Movie clips, because we get so busy here, there's not many of us.
[02:26:29.184 --> 02:26:32.786]  I want to get the movie clip of Jim Garrison's summation in JFK.
[02:26:32.947 --> 02:26:33.667]  I want to play that.
[02:26:34.107 --> 02:26:36.889]  I want to get the movie clip from all those films you're talking about.
[02:26:36.929 --> 02:26:41.231]  If you guys will load them up on the web, email them to ryan at infowars.com.
[02:26:41.612 --> 02:26:44.553]  We'll start posting the audio and playing it here on the show every day.
[02:26:44.834 --> 02:26:45.514]  Help us out.
[02:26:45.574 --> 02:26:50.177]  I mean, I buy these DVDs and then we just stack them up and never even have time to go.
[02:26:50.277 --> 02:26:52.138]  That's how hard we're working.
[02:26:52.938 --> 02:26:57.682]  And we have expanded the staff here, but with more people just comes even more work.
[02:26:57.762 --> 02:27:05.688]  So you guys help us out, just like you sent us that video clip of the police knowingly beating people up and then claiming they attacked them.
[02:27:05.748 --> 02:27:06.389]  We posted it.
[02:27:06.769 --> 02:27:07.850]  So I commend you.
[02:27:07.890 --> 02:27:08.691]  Anything else, Russell?
[02:27:08.911 --> 02:27:10.812]  No, Alex, you're doing a fantastic job.
[02:27:11.012 --> 02:27:15.636]  And we out here appreciate your efforts in speaking the truth, Alex.
[02:27:15.756 --> 02:27:16.396]  God bless you.
[02:27:16.416 --> 02:27:17.497]  I appreciate you, my friend.
[02:27:17.838 --> 02:27:20.079]  You know, it's not that hard to expose the lies now.
[02:27:20.099 --> 02:27:22.081]  I mean, it's just a solid wall of them.
[02:27:23.101 --> 02:27:26.383]  And you know what the Marines say when they were in North Korea surrounded.
[02:27:27.364 --> 02:27:28.725]  Sir, we're completely surrounded.
[02:27:28.905 --> 02:27:29.225]  Good.
[02:27:29.285 --> 02:27:30.846]  Don't let any of the enemy escape.
[02:27:32.187 --> 02:27:32.848]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.709 --> 02:27:36.610]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:38.711]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.632 --> 02:27:42.314]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:49.601]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:49.761 --> 02:27:51.921]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:52.201 --> 02:28:02.284]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:28:02.604 --> 02:28:04.985]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:30:28.746 --> 02:30:29.806]  We really got to move quick.
[02:30:58.010 --> 02:31:00.533]  Let's go ahead and go to Russell in Florida.
[02:31:00.993 --> 02:31:01.854]  We already talked to Russell.
[02:31:01.934 --> 02:31:02.314]  Duh.
[02:31:02.855 --> 02:31:03.956]  Alex in Connecticut.
[02:31:04.256 --> 02:31:05.197]  You're on the air, Alex.
[02:31:05.217 --> 02:31:05.618]  Go ahead.
[02:31:05.638 --> 02:31:06.899]  How you doing?
[02:31:07.299 --> 02:31:07.760]  Good, my friend.
[02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:08.280]  What's on your mind?
[02:31:08.521 --> 02:31:08.721]  Good.
[02:31:08.961 --> 02:31:11.003]  A few quick things I just want to run by.
[02:31:11.023 --> 02:31:11.824]  I don't know if you're aware.
[02:31:13.446 --> 02:31:16.429]  There's this website that I found on the website talking about you.
[02:31:16.449 --> 02:31:17.089]  I don't know.
[02:31:17.109 --> 02:31:18.090]  You're probably aware about it.
[02:31:18.471 --> 02:31:19.652]  The Houston Independent Media.
[02:31:20.316 --> 02:31:20.576]  No.
[02:31:20.917 --> 02:31:22.018]  Okay, and what does it say?
[02:31:22.358 --> 02:31:23.860]  It says, oh, I know that one.
[02:31:23.880 --> 02:31:25.082]  Yeah, I'm a Scientologist.
[02:31:25.482 --> 02:31:29.647]  Oh, I don't even know, but this one says, I don't know what this is, so you're probably aware of it.
[02:31:29.827 --> 02:31:34.192]  Oh, I guess it says you have credible and truthful information, but why are you ignoring...
[02:31:35.547 --> 02:31:40.430]  Yeah, I've been sent that before.
[02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:48.095]  It's some Noahide law to cut our heads off, and then I type that bill in and don't find anything.
[02:31:48.115 --> 02:31:55.799]  I had a guest on years ago about some Noahide laws, and it's just another one of these things that I haven't been able to totally document.
[02:31:56.100 --> 02:31:57.440]  And thanks for the call.
[02:31:58.101 --> 02:31:59.081]  This is what people do.
[02:32:00.342 --> 02:32:03.304]  Folks, I have a giant stack of news we haven't been able to cover yet.
[02:32:03.943 --> 02:32:06.225]  The world is not about Alex Jones.
[02:32:07.626 --> 02:32:08.006]  Okay?
[02:32:08.806 --> 02:32:10.968]  The show is not about Alex Jones.
[02:32:12.629 --> 02:32:18.333]  And, yes, that particular web page that you read down says I'm a Scientologist, basically.
[02:32:18.773 --> 02:32:21.635]  Because it says there's a guy named Alex Jones who's a Scientologist.
[02:32:21.675 --> 02:32:24.737]  And he's a 56-year-old guy with black hair.
[02:32:24.757 --> 02:32:27.699]  And I am 32 years old now.
[02:32:27.979 --> 02:32:31.002]  And I'm not a Scientologist.
[02:32:31.042 --> 02:32:33.023]  In fact, we were at the Farmer's Market this weekend.
[02:32:34.486 --> 02:32:40.028]  The Scientologists were out there, their own booth, trying to recruit us, and we went the other direction.
[02:32:40.648 --> 02:32:44.390]  In fact, that's the first time I've ever seen a Scientologist in person.
[02:32:45.610 --> 02:32:46.150]  That's not true.
[02:32:46.170 --> 02:32:50.332]  I've driven down the UT drag and seen the Scientology church front down there.
[02:32:51.292 --> 02:32:54.253]  And I do not agree with their psychology or the stuff they're doing.
[02:32:54.293 --> 02:32:59.395]  I do agree with them on drugs, not drugging people, saying it damages people.
[02:32:59.435 --> 02:33:00.996]  But it doesn't matter to folks.
[02:33:01.216 --> 02:33:03.517]  If there's a guy named Alex Jones who's a Scientologist, then...
[02:33:04.523 --> 02:33:05.544]  By goodness, I'm one.
[02:33:05.684 --> 02:33:06.404]  So, fine.
[02:33:06.444 --> 02:33:07.244]  Okay, I am then.
[02:33:07.325 --> 02:33:09.906]  I'm just sad I'm not, but if... I mean, pick it.
[02:33:09.986 --> 02:33:10.766]  I'm a Nazi.
[02:33:11.026 --> 02:33:12.627]  I'm a Zionist operative.
[02:33:12.747 --> 02:33:14.048]  I'm a Scientologist.
[02:33:15.369 --> 02:33:17.570]  I get an email about once a week.
[02:33:17.770 --> 02:33:25.394]  And I'm probably missing some of them, but on average about every week going, Oh, see you write for the New York Times.
[02:33:25.814 --> 02:33:27.835]  Leading a double life.
[02:33:27.955 --> 02:33:31.637]  Because there's some 60-something-year-old guy named Alex S. Jones.
[02:33:33.425 --> 02:33:35.466]  And he also has an NPR radio show.
[02:33:35.646 --> 02:33:37.446]  And I'm, okay, I'm him too.
[02:33:38.166 --> 02:33:40.607]  And I have to waste time a couple times a week.
[02:33:40.967 --> 02:33:43.067]  And I don't blame listeners for calling in and asking this stuff.
[02:33:43.087 --> 02:33:43.988]  Go ahead if you want to.
[02:33:44.008 --> 02:33:46.388]  It just has to be responded to.
[02:33:46.408 --> 02:33:48.969]  And I am not that person either.
[02:33:49.209 --> 02:33:57.891]  And there is some billionaire in Canada who owns canning companies and packaging companies all over the western world named Alex E. Jones.
[02:33:57.931 --> 02:33:59.471]  He even has the same initials as me.
[02:33:59.972 --> 02:34:01.692]  His middle name is an emmerich like mine.
[02:34:02.646 --> 02:34:06.310]  That's why Paul Watson goes by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:34:07.731 --> 02:34:17.801]  Oh, but then it was pointed out that Joseph Goebbels' name was Paul Joseph, and their whole webpage is saying it proves that that's a pen name and we're really Nazis.
[02:34:18.522 --> 02:34:22.465]  No, that's what Paul's parents named him, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:34:22.525 --> 02:34:24.087]  I don't know his brother's name.
[02:34:24.127 --> 02:34:25.408]  It's Steve Watson.
[02:34:25.448 --> 02:34:26.049]  I don't know his middle name.
[02:34:26.998 --> 02:34:29.279]  And here we are a couple minutes into this.
[02:34:29.359 --> 02:34:31.120]  There's no way to respond to it.
[02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:33.221]  There's no way to counter it.
[02:34:35.562 --> 02:34:37.262]  And it's even worse than that.
[02:34:37.282 --> 02:34:46.466]  You know, the average American watches TV and doesn't even think about where it comes from.
[02:34:46.826 --> 02:34:51.288]  Where does Brian Williams on NBC come from?
[02:34:52.544 --> 02:34:54.025]  How is he on your TV set?
[02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:56.166]  Well, it's satellited to your town.
[02:34:56.206 --> 02:35:01.770]  You pick it up on satellite or a satellite sent to a cable company and that is sent out.
[02:35:04.071 --> 02:35:05.572]  And then you pick it up and you watch it.
[02:35:06.493 --> 02:35:07.853]  And then you go, Alex, we know that.
[02:35:07.873 --> 02:35:08.934]  Don't talk to us like we're stupid.
[02:35:08.954 --> 02:35:10.255]  I know most of you are smarter than I am.
[02:35:10.295 --> 02:35:11.055]  I'm saying so.
[02:35:11.336 --> 02:35:17.900]  But about half the population, literally, I mean, I realize it more and more every day, is far past dumb.
[02:35:17.940 --> 02:35:18.440]  They're like...
[02:35:19.153 --> 02:35:19.714]  We're good to go.
[02:35:37.839 --> 02:35:45.765]  Most Americans in a poll they had a few months ago think that the Civil War of the 1860s was the Revolutionary War.
[02:35:45.785 --> 02:35:47.807]  They think George Washington was involved in it.
[02:35:48.087 --> 02:35:49.048]  I mean, it's scary.
[02:35:49.368 --> 02:35:52.931]  So, you say I'm a Scientologist?
[02:35:53.091 --> 02:35:53.471]  Okay.
[02:35:53.511 --> 02:35:54.732]  You say I work for the New York Times?
[02:35:54.812 --> 02:35:55.152]  Okay.
[02:35:55.172 --> 02:35:56.994]  I mean, I'm a whole bunch of people, folks.
[02:35:57.054 --> 02:35:57.274]  No.
[02:35:57.894 --> 02:36:01.037]  I'm a guy from Rockwall, Texas, who's lived an awesome half of his life.
[02:36:02.527 --> 02:36:05.728]  And maybe I should just have some gigantic bio about myself.
[02:36:05.748 --> 02:36:07.488]  I already have a pretty big one on the website.
[02:36:07.508 --> 02:36:10.189]  It's not as big as it should be.
[02:36:10.209 --> 02:36:14.670]  And then maybe just chronicle, you know, frequently asked questions.
[02:36:14.690 --> 02:36:15.470]  Is this true?
[02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:16.190]  Is that true?
[02:36:17.271 --> 02:36:20.031]  And then, again, look how boring this is.
[02:36:20.791 --> 02:36:23.412]  Talking about Alex Jones all day is not fun.
[02:36:24.831 --> 02:36:27.612]  And it's not really constructive and it doesn't defeat the New World Order.
[02:36:27.632 --> 02:36:28.352]  And it sure doesn't.
[02:36:29.212 --> 02:36:31.152]  I mean, you tune into Rush Limbaugh.
[02:36:31.172 --> 02:36:33.273]  The whole show is about Rush Limbaugh.
[02:36:33.653 --> 02:36:38.974]  He just constantly talks about how smart he is and how he's Rush Limbaugh and how big he is and how great he is.
[02:36:39.074 --> 02:36:40.715]  O'Reilly does the same thing.
[02:36:40.735 --> 02:36:46.696]  I mean, that's one of the saving graces of Sean Hannity is he's not a complete egomaniac, at least on the surface.
[02:36:46.756 --> 02:36:49.496]  He doesn't sit there and just babble about himself all day.
[02:36:49.697 --> 02:36:51.697]  But listeners will force you to do it.
[02:36:52.361 --> 02:36:53.662]  And I'm getting real irritated right now.
[02:36:53.702 --> 02:36:57.305]  I may not even have time to take these other calls now because I've got a bunch of audio clips and news to cover.
[02:36:57.665 --> 02:36:59.707]  Because once I get on a roll, I just want to say it all.
[02:36:59.967 --> 02:37:01.748]  Let me just give you another little tidbit of knowledge.
[02:37:04.050 --> 02:37:11.555]  You know what really is a bee in my bonnet or one of my pet peeves or a burr under my saddle?
[02:37:12.436 --> 02:37:13.597]  Whatever analogy you want.
[02:37:14.984 --> 02:37:16.585]  Is that people glom on to me.
[02:37:17.106 --> 02:37:17.846]  And I don't know why.
[02:37:17.866 --> 02:37:19.828]  I mean, obviously I really do.
[02:37:19.848 --> 02:37:26.333]  I'm the most prominent anti-New World Order person out there with the biggest audience and the most people visiting his websites and fighting New World Order.
[02:37:26.974 --> 02:37:29.436]  People go on websites and say, I said things I didn't say.
[02:37:29.476 --> 02:37:30.597]  They say they're my buddies.
[02:37:30.897 --> 02:37:33.399]  They represent themselves as working with me all the time.
[02:37:33.639 --> 02:37:35.321]  Happens all the time.
[02:37:36.802 --> 02:37:38.243]  All over the country.
[02:37:39.584 --> 02:37:41.666]  And then I have to deal with the repercussions of it.
[02:37:42.472 --> 02:37:43.753]  Even happens in foreign countries.
[02:37:44.273 --> 02:37:45.533]  And then something else happens.
[02:37:47.154 --> 02:37:51.315]  There's one individual who moved into this area, acted all friendly, tried to get some credibility.
[02:37:52.736 --> 02:37:53.776]  I was friendly towards him.
[02:37:54.376 --> 02:37:58.938]  And it was all with an eye to set themselves up and then start attacking everyone systematically.
[02:37:59.378 --> 02:38:05.060]  And then imagine, I'm on a local radio station, so people hear that and they think it's Alex locally.
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:07.621]  They don't know that it's brought down off satellite.
[02:38:08.121 --> 02:38:08.502]  We're good to go.
[02:38:08.522 --> 02:38:09.242]  We're good to go.
[02:38:28.866 --> 02:38:36.919]  It's baloney, it's bull, it's hokum, it's whatever you want to call it, and I am sick of my mother.
[02:38:36.979 --> 02:38:37.520]  Real smart.
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:39.163]  Comes over to the house and out, water in the garden.
[02:38:39.804 --> 02:38:42.869]  Why does that guy, if he's on your station, say all those bad things about you?
[02:38:43.931 --> 02:38:45.372]  Well, no, Mom, that's another network.
[02:38:45.432 --> 02:38:47.273]  No, no, it's a station you're on.
[02:38:47.313 --> 02:38:49.714]  No, Mom, I'm on a satellite, see?
[02:38:50.274 --> 02:38:54.916]  And I said, Mom, remember when you grew up in Austin, how LBJ only allowed one TV station in town because he owned it?
[02:38:55.216 --> 02:39:04.220]  He wouldn't give out licenses, and so growing up, you got pieces of all three networks on there, or he'd air all three newscasts back-to-back, you know, after each other, and nobody else got that.
[02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:04.880]  It was kind of interesting.
[02:39:05.341 --> 02:39:06.541]  Oh, yeah, you mean it's like that?
[02:39:06.621 --> 02:39:06.921]  Yeah.
[02:39:07.342 --> 02:39:10.423]  Yeah, see, it's... So I had to... And then...
[02:39:11.218 --> 02:39:13.279]  We've got family in town and they say the same thing.
[02:39:13.319 --> 02:39:14.480]  I have to sit there.
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:15.901]  I'm walking to the grocery store.
[02:39:16.481 --> 02:39:19.163]  Why does your boss say this about you?
[02:39:19.763 --> 02:39:20.804]  Someone I can't stand.
[02:39:21.084 --> 02:39:26.907]  Someone who understands that, who uses that to get credibility and carte blanche from people.
[02:39:27.148 --> 02:39:28.028]  I'm sick of it!
[02:39:28.949 --> 02:39:38.474]  They want to know why I... And then I wonder why Alex has been kind of passively attacking back after a year plus of taking a tax.
[02:39:38.935 --> 02:39:39.515]  Because...
[02:39:40.339 --> 02:39:42.621]  Not because you're, quote, hurting me personally.
[02:39:42.641 --> 02:39:46.584]  I mean, the people listening to me in this town is a very small part of what I do.
[02:39:47.185 --> 02:39:49.606]  Okay, it isn't my whole world like it is to some of these losers.
[02:39:50.847 --> 02:39:51.748]  You have to understand this.
[02:39:52.208 --> 02:39:56.492]  I'm tired of it and irritated by it, by having people come up to me.
[02:39:57.654 --> 02:39:57.914]  I think.
[02:39:57.934 --> 02:39:58.095]  I think.
[02:39:58.115 --> 02:39:58.355]  I think.
[02:39:58.375 --> 02:39:58.615]  I think.
[02:40:24.159 --> 02:40:26.564]  He's Irish Shedder and Labrador Retriever.
[02:40:26.584 --> 02:40:28.427]  I don't know why I'm telling you that, but that's the point.
[02:40:29.128 --> 02:40:30.050]  And I'd already been brought home.
[02:40:30.070 --> 02:40:30.350]  I was about 20.
[02:40:30.571 --> 02:40:32.775]  My mom says, well, you come give the dog a walk.
[02:40:33.365 --> 02:40:36.247]  Because I've been in college and they kept the dog and they still have him.
[02:40:36.487 --> 02:40:37.928]  So I took him out, let him off the leash.
[02:40:37.968 --> 02:40:40.570]  He ran 200 yards and got out into a road.
[02:40:40.590 --> 02:40:42.572]  Because I was in a park way away from a road.
[02:40:42.612 --> 02:40:43.893]  He chased a squirrel out in a road.
[02:40:44.193 --> 02:40:45.194]  Got hit by a car.
[02:40:45.534 --> 02:40:46.955]  I picked him up, put him in my truck.
[02:40:47.315 --> 02:40:48.856]  Took him to the vet.
[02:40:48.976 --> 02:40:49.537]  He lived.
[02:40:49.817 --> 02:40:52.319]  But his entire leg is like 90% paralyzed.
[02:40:52.579 --> 02:40:53.520]  So he drags it.
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:55.161]  He drags it and sets it in front of himself.
[02:40:55.761 --> 02:41:00.804]  Now, every time I would take the dog for a walk, and still do, people, oh, does he have a sticker in his paw?
[02:41:00.844 --> 02:41:01.364]  What's wrong?
[02:41:01.784 --> 02:41:04.765]  One out of 50 might say, does your owner hurt you?
[02:41:05.146 --> 02:41:11.489]  And I go, lady, do you know how rude that is to walk up to me and talk to my dog and ask the dog if I hurt its leg?
[02:41:11.889 --> 02:41:13.149]  The dog doesn't have a sticker.
[02:41:13.329 --> 02:41:14.910]  He was run over by a truck.
[02:41:15.450 --> 02:41:16.231]  You want to get technical?
[02:41:16.251 --> 02:41:22.774]  He was run over by some, whatever that little Chevy car is that has the convertible top, a brown convertible top car.
[02:41:23.982 --> 02:41:27.203]  I mean, by the hundredth time that happened, I've heard screaming at people.
[02:41:28.003 --> 02:41:33.645]  It isn't like people asking about the dog's hurt leg, you know, was somehow really getting to me on a level that mattered.
[02:41:33.665 --> 02:41:34.845]  It's that I'm sick of it!
[02:41:37.366 --> 02:41:42.507]  I bet people who are disabled get sick of people asking them stupid questions.
[02:41:44.248 --> 02:41:51.590]  I mean, listen, I don't take hundreds of advertisers that I endorse because I don't believe in them 100%, or I haven't tested them.
[02:41:52.770 --> 02:41:53.090]  Okay?
[02:41:54.381 --> 02:41:54.881]  Okay?
[02:41:54.941 --> 02:42:00.423]  I mean, debt forgiveness, magic cures, all this other stuff, I just don't touch it with a 10-foot pole.
[02:42:00.923 --> 02:42:01.243]  Okay?
[02:42:03.104 --> 02:42:07.385]  But still, I have to be associated with it, and I don't like that, folks.
[02:42:07.945 --> 02:42:09.166]  And I've said I don't like that.
[02:42:10.186 --> 02:42:13.547]  You know, I have been sent large donations before.
[02:42:13.567 --> 02:42:15.568]  I will call up, and I don't ask for them, you notice.
[02:42:15.848 --> 02:42:17.308]  I'll call them and go, well, are you wealthy?
[02:42:17.348 --> 02:42:18.288]  And they go, why, do you want more?
[02:42:18.308 --> 02:42:20.269]  And I go, no, if you don't have a lot of money...
[02:42:21.511 --> 02:42:22.753]  I don't want this donation.
[02:42:22.773 --> 02:42:26.658]  If you're wealthy, I'll use this to buy computers and cameras and stuff and for airplane tickets.
[02:42:27.158 --> 02:42:29.141]  And if they got money, I'll say, well, thank you.
[02:42:29.441 --> 02:42:30.522]  And thank you for the support.
[02:42:30.542 --> 02:42:31.964]  I don't even ask for more.
[02:42:32.905 --> 02:42:33.986]  And those listeners are out there.
[02:42:34.007 --> 02:42:34.727]  They know that's happening.
[02:42:37.003 --> 02:42:53.226]  Imagine, I'm not saying I'm really great or good, it's that I have a conscience, and I just grew up around corrupt preachers in Dallas, that's the big headquarters of all the fake evangelists, that I don't want to be associated with that.
[02:42:53.586 --> 02:43:01.048]  Imagine having to be on the radio locally, trying to have an upstanding radio show, trying to have high moral standards,
[02:43:01.588 --> 02:43:14.277]  And then there's some other network with several different nuts on it who attack me and then imply they're with me and then sit there and suck off an audience I sent there to begin with.
[02:43:15.298 --> 02:43:16.498]  That really gets to me.
[02:43:17.759 --> 02:43:20.521]  And that's why I never attack other people in this movement.
[02:43:20.701 --> 02:43:21.842]  Because I know it's the kiss of death.
[02:43:21.862 --> 02:43:23.043]  Nobody wants to listen to it.
[02:43:23.664 --> 02:43:24.905]  But I can't control myself.
[02:43:25.125 --> 02:43:31.589]  I'm going to have to write big exposés, and I'm going to have to go public, and I'm going to have to give you every piece of dirt you can imagine.
[02:43:31.789 --> 02:43:33.670]  It's unbelievable what I know.
[02:43:33.690 --> 02:43:41.094]  And you see, when I get emotional, I say I'm going to do that, and I am on the edge of doing it.
[02:43:41.214 --> 02:43:42.135]  I may, I may not.
[02:43:42.175 --> 02:43:43.436]  I don't know.
[02:43:43.516 --> 02:43:48.899]  Either it stops, the immoral stuff stops, or I have to attack it.
[02:43:49.617 --> 02:43:52.659]  I mean, my goodness, to hear, max out your credit cards.
[02:43:52.699 --> 02:43:55.982]  Folks, if you do that now with the bankruptcy laws, you still owe it.
[02:43:56.502 --> 02:43:57.883]  I've actually heard that over and over again.
[02:43:58.363 --> 02:43:59.965]  Imagine that!
[02:44:00.185 --> 02:44:01.746]  People are wondering why I don't like it.
[02:44:03.747 --> 02:44:06.209]  You do something, and then you wonder why we don't like it.
[02:44:06.229 --> 02:44:07.070]  It's like the New World Order.
[02:44:07.090 --> 02:44:10.292]  They do all this stuff they do, and then they wonder why we don't like it, why we hate them.
[02:44:11.373 --> 02:44:16.777]  Or if you're going to die, when you die, give me your inheritance, give me everything.
[02:44:18.177 --> 02:44:19.218]  Can you imagine?
[02:44:19.898 --> 02:44:21.399]  I have to be associated with that.
[02:44:22.219 --> 02:44:23.940]  I don't want to be associated with it.
[02:44:29.643 --> 02:44:31.064]  Maybe I should just go all the way right now.
[02:44:32.104 --> 02:44:33.065]  No, I need to chronicle it.
[02:44:33.085 --> 02:44:35.646]  It's so horrible and so huge.
[02:44:36.587 --> 02:44:38.988]  I would have to just go all the way with it.
[02:44:39.748 --> 02:44:41.689]  You cannot even imagine, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:41.709 --> 02:44:42.250]  Maybe you could.
[02:44:43.422 --> 02:44:44.042]  I just see this.
[02:44:44.082 --> 02:44:45.403]  You know, I didn't talk about this.
[02:44:46.023 --> 02:44:47.804]  It was in the front page of the Statesman on Friday.
[02:44:47.824 --> 02:44:50.205]  In fact, let me pull it up on my website here.
[02:44:50.245 --> 02:44:53.927]  My mouse has batteries out, so I'm not very quick with this little hand pad.
[02:44:53.947 --> 02:44:56.148]  Let me pull this up out of the Statesman.
[02:44:56.328 --> 02:44:58.990]  Because, you know, there's a lot of stuff I know that I don't get into.
[02:44:59.570 --> 02:45:01.971]  It's like somebody sends me an email threatening to get the president.
[02:45:02.251 --> 02:45:03.232]  I call the Secret Service.
[02:45:04.092 --> 02:45:06.413]  Because I thought it was a setup.
[02:45:07.334 --> 02:45:08.814]  It turned out it was in Tennessee newspapers.
[02:45:08.855 --> 02:45:09.635]  It was a total nut.
[02:45:12.333 --> 02:45:13.734]  But here it is.
[02:45:14.274 --> 02:45:16.335]  Let me just click on the actual news article here.
[02:45:19.237 --> 02:45:22.299]  Here's an example of the type of stuff that I have to deal with, okay?
[02:45:22.639 --> 02:45:26.561]  We found out that the board of directors of AXIS TV was going to try to restrict free speech.
[02:45:26.962 --> 02:45:35.226]  So I hired, you know, we got investigators and lawyers and took them to court and did all this, and we found out instead that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been stolen.
[02:45:37.708 --> 02:45:37.788]  And...
[02:45:38.659 --> 02:45:39.440]  Now, here it is.
[02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:41.922]  Here's the headline from the Austin American-Statesman.
[02:45:42.022 --> 02:45:44.464]  Access TV's ex-boss sought in theft.
[02:45:48.547 --> 02:45:49.428]  Here it is, right here.
[02:45:49.488 --> 02:45:50.209]  You can go read it.
[02:45:50.429 --> 02:45:52.471]  And this is a whole separate issue from what I'm talking about.
[02:45:53.351 --> 02:46:00.798]  You see, and we were in there, and we knew stuff was going on, and so I wrote the article, and I wrote a comment along with the Statesman article.
[02:46:00.818 --> 02:46:03.600]  Let me just go back to it.
[02:46:06.394 --> 02:46:08.675]  My crew gets so excited in the other room hearing me talk about this.
[02:46:08.695 --> 02:46:10.815]  They're talking so loud, it's coming in the studio, so they need to stop.
[02:46:12.135 --> 02:46:14.276]  But let me just read to you, and we can't take calls now.
[02:46:14.296 --> 02:46:15.116]  Sorry, folks.
[02:46:15.196 --> 02:46:17.337]  I see somebody got me off on a jag here.
[02:46:18.097 --> 02:46:23.198]  Former AXS TV director accused of theft warrant issued for John Villareal's arrest.
[02:46:23.218 --> 02:46:25.659]  Now, what did that tell you about this guy a year ago on air?
[02:46:26.383 --> 02:46:29.726]  I said, we know they're trying to take over free speech, and we know there's other stuff going on.
[02:46:30.127 --> 02:46:31.027]  We know there's fraud.
[02:46:31.288 --> 02:46:33.690]  By the way, he isn't the only one, and it's more money than this.
[02:46:34.050 --> 02:46:36.192]  And we supply... Let me just read our comment here.
[02:46:37.333 --> 02:46:41.017]  Alex Jones at Infowars.com with the first launch investigation on corruption.
[02:46:41.117 --> 02:46:44.200]  By the way, I've been running my own investigation on other people for the last six months.
[02:46:45.749 --> 02:46:52.475]  AlexJonesInfoAwards.com was the first to launch an investigation on corruption in Austin's local cable access TV station, ACTV.
[02:46:52.535 --> 02:46:59.262]  Over a year ago, we discovered a move by the management of ACTV, the founding... That's where access TV was founded, 33 years ago.
[02:46:59.682 --> 02:47:06.028]  To restrict free speech, we conducted our own investigation and covertly supplied the district attorney's office with much of their case.
[02:47:07.091 --> 02:47:08.473]  And the fraud auditor and all the rest of it.
[02:47:08.794 --> 02:47:10.997]  Stephan Ray, Pam Thompson, and others were instrumental, too.
[02:47:11.557 --> 02:47:16.845]  We began our investigation simply to prove that the members of the management were attempting to violate the Charter of Access Television.
[02:47:16.865 --> 02:47:23.054]  I cannot talk about much of what I know because it might aid others who are clearly involved in evading prosecution.
[02:47:23.832 --> 02:47:34.700]  We were getting ready to break our silence because it looked as though the police were never going to move, but now they are, and for the district attorney, the city of Austin, the police department, need to be commended.
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:37.763]  This is what they're supposed to be doing, not running warrantless checkpoints.
[02:47:37.823 --> 02:47:39.024]  Now, read the article.
[02:47:40.305 --> 02:47:40.665]  Okay.
[02:47:41.505 --> 02:47:48.691]  An arrest warrant has been issued for the former director of Austin Community Access TV stations who was accused of stealing more than $350,000 from the city-supported non-profit.
[02:47:52.842 --> 02:47:53.483]  And I sat there.
[02:47:53.503 --> 02:47:54.405]  I've known this for a year.
[02:47:54.685 --> 02:47:56.428]  And we want to get all of them, folks.
[02:47:56.448 --> 02:47:57.810]  That's why I'm not telling you the rest right now.
[02:47:58.231 --> 02:48:04.360]  John Villareal, 51, is wanted for aggravated theft and first-degree felony, punishable by five years of life in prison.
[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:07.465]  According to court documents filed late Wednesday, Villareal stole...
[02:48:08.306 --> 02:48:14.190]  By making 94 unauthorized withdrawals from the Office of Community Access Center's accounts from January 2000 to September 2004.
[02:48:14.331 --> 02:48:16.032]  They haven't caught him yet.
[02:48:16.052 --> 02:48:16.632]  He isn't at home.
[02:48:16.652 --> 02:48:17.553]  He's obviously fleeing.
[02:48:17.933 --> 02:48:18.514]  Absconding.
[02:48:18.814 --> 02:48:23.938]  And then you read down into here, it says that he even claimed that big accounting firms had done accounting.
[02:48:24.198 --> 02:48:25.419]  He falsified that.
[02:48:25.939 --> 02:48:26.860]  They got the documents.
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:29.422]  It's alleged in falsified fake reports.
[02:48:30.483 --> 02:48:36.347]  Well, I had to spend $11,000 to get the documents, to sue, to ferret about.
[02:48:37.686 --> 02:48:42.068]  I had to really bust my hind along with your help to do this, and that's just one little thing of corruption.
[02:48:42.468 --> 02:48:44.469]  I don't want to be associated with it!
[02:48:46.170 --> 02:48:53.554]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:53.814 --> 02:48:58.556]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:58.776 --> 02:49:04.419]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.659 --> 02:49:09.183]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.403 --> 02:49:16.569]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:16.590 --> 02:49:21.133]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.294 --> 02:49:23.796]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.036 --> 02:49:30.742]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:51:50.908 --> 02:51:58.272]  You know, I talked, and it says in the article that it was an Austin producer that brought forward the information and exposed them.
[02:51:58.312 --> 02:51:59.433]  It was actually a couple of us.
[02:52:00.333 --> 02:52:03.215]  And exposed all the stuff that was going on.
[02:52:03.275 --> 02:52:05.636]  And there were threats and other things that happened.
[02:52:06.391 --> 02:52:06.751]  We're good to go.
[02:52:06.771 --> 02:52:06.952]  I think?
[02:52:20.476 --> 02:52:24.318]  And that's why all these other people are failures, because they spend their whole shows doing that.
[02:52:24.598 --> 02:52:37.443]  This is about news and information, but I think what we talked about in the last segment is an illustration and is educational for listeners, just to start realizing that there's more detail to the things going on behind the scenes in everyday life.
[02:52:37.463 --> 02:52:39.404]  You know, I have this clip of the police beating people up.
[02:52:39.924 --> 02:52:41.966]  In New York and then charging them with assaulting them.
[02:52:42.366 --> 02:52:43.047]  Provocateuring.
[02:52:43.067 --> 02:52:45.308]  That's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:52:45.568 --> 02:52:46.629]  We won't have time to air it.
[02:52:47.050 --> 02:52:51.793]  I'll have to air the rest of this tomorrow, too, but since we promised we'd air part of it, this is from the ABC News.
[02:52:51.953 --> 02:52:53.655]  iScan technology comes to schools.
[02:52:54.135 --> 02:52:57.117]  This is where they sell you on how great it is in New Jersey.
[02:52:57.477 --> 02:52:58.778]  Let's just play a little bit of this.
[02:52:58.798 --> 02:52:59.499]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:06.842]  They are considered the ultimate in security technology.
[02:53:07.182 --> 02:53:08.103]  Iris scans.
[02:53:08.323 --> 02:53:10.424]  Secure enough, yes, for Charlie's Angels.
[02:53:11.065 --> 02:53:16.528]  And off the silver screen, they're a favorite among the military and in the nation's airports and hotels.
[02:53:16.629 --> 02:53:18.830]  Orlando International Airport already using them.
[02:53:19.210 --> 02:53:23.173]  And by summer, airports in Boston, Minneapolis, Houston, and D.C.
[02:53:23.253 --> 02:53:23.933]  could be too.
[02:53:24.454 --> 02:53:29.117]  Now, this cutting-edge technology may be coming to a grammar school near you.
[02:53:29.717 --> 02:53:35.941]  This week, a school district in New Jersey became the second in the nation to launch the iSCAN security system.
[02:53:36.501 --> 02:53:39.043]  Our Dan Harris is in Freehold this morning.
[02:53:39.083 --> 02:53:40.564]  And tell us exactly how this works.
[02:53:40.644 --> 02:53:42.465]  It's actually the iris, right, Dan?
[02:53:42.945 --> 02:53:43.506]  It's the iris.
[02:53:43.526 --> 02:53:45.907]  And the iris is the colored part around your pupil.
[02:53:45.967 --> 02:53:47.969]  So it's not just an iSCAN, it's an iris scan.
[02:53:50.629 --> 02:53:56.671]  Let's just stop right there.
[02:53:56.751 --> 02:54:02.992]  And we'll play the rest tomorrow.
[02:54:03.893 --> 02:54:06.873]  You're going to have to have this to get your school lunch.
[02:54:07.093 --> 02:54:07.413]  Why?
[02:54:07.433 --> 02:54:08.194]  Because we say so.
[02:54:08.574 --> 02:54:12.034]  You're going to have to have this to check out books for your parents to pick you up at school.
[02:54:12.515 --> 02:54:13.855]  It's making everything a prison.
[02:54:14.315 --> 02:54:16.496]  Well, it's to make sure the right person picks your child up.
[02:54:16.736 --> 02:54:18.276]  Well, statistically, that's not a threat.
[02:54:19.469 --> 02:54:22.130]  The teachers and the school officials are, statistically.
[02:54:22.150 --> 02:54:23.550]  That's who's around them.
[02:54:23.570 --> 02:54:24.590]  That's where the predators go.
[02:54:25.470 --> 02:54:27.270]  But everything's a prison.
[02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:29.551]  This will be used for the cashless society.
[02:54:29.571 --> 02:54:31.371]  And we told you a decade ago this was the plan.
[02:54:31.791 --> 02:54:33.411]  You've got to fight these coming into your town.
[02:54:33.431 --> 02:54:36.132]  They're trying to put them in out in the Westlake School District.
[02:54:36.152 --> 02:54:42.653]  They've already got these evil ID cards, and they run your background check whenever you come to the school to be a, quote, visitor.
[02:54:43.513 --> 02:54:44.113]  So it's training you.
[02:54:44.153 --> 02:54:47.934]  I mean, if they train you when you're a kid how to be a prisoner, then you'll be a prisoner your whole adult life.
[02:54:48.624 --> 02:54:50.966]  And that's all this is, part of a bigger picture.
[02:54:51.006 --> 02:54:58.131]  I apologize to the other callers, but a caller earlier just wanted me to answer the same tired thing for the hundredth time, which is fine.
[02:54:58.792 --> 02:55:00.353]  So I tried to answer it for you.
[02:55:01.494 --> 02:55:04.656]  But in the future, when you hear me go, Nope, already answered that, I'm moving on.
[02:55:04.676 --> 02:55:07.679]  I think every ten times I get asked that stuff, I'll answer it.
[02:55:07.699 --> 02:55:10.721]  I think that's fair, because it's not fair to the general audience.
[02:55:11.021 --> 02:55:13.383]  But I don't want to avoid questions either.
[02:55:13.943 --> 02:55:14.204]  It's just...
[02:55:16.386 --> 02:55:18.928]  It's like a tag in your shirt that scratches you.
[02:55:19.249 --> 02:55:22.691]  It shouldn't even be that big of a deal, but it's like, man, I'm getting tired of that.
[02:55:24.833 --> 02:55:25.474]  And then there's this.
[02:55:25.514 --> 02:55:30.098]  The really big news of the day, which I'll have to spend about 60 seconds on, but I'll spend a lot of time tomorrow on this.
[02:55:31.839 --> 02:55:35.602]  Group airs ad on 24 hoping to influence debate on Patriot Act.
[02:55:36.143 --> 02:55:44.630]  Chicago Tribune's Jack Bauer, the fictional counterterrorism agent on Fox Network TV show 24, hasn't actually waded into the debate on civil liberties yet.
[02:55:45.111 --> 02:55:49.092]  Versus terrorism and surveillance as Congress considers making changes in the U.S.
[02:55:49.132 --> 02:55:49.712]  Patriot Act.
[02:55:50.092 --> 02:55:58.274]  And a Fed-controlled group went and put an ad in saying, is it really good to weaken terrorists with real-life terrorists with this legislation?
[02:55:59.594 --> 02:56:04.855]  And they said, lobby Congress, get the Patriot Act passed and strengthened.
[02:56:05.135 --> 02:56:08.416]  And that's a bill where if you protest, you get a year in prison.
[02:56:08.916 --> 02:56:10.276]  With a national police force.
[02:56:11.016 --> 02:56:13.557]  I mean, oh, I've got to cover this more tomorrow.
[02:56:14.591 --> 02:56:15.452]  I shouldn't have digressed.
[02:56:15.492 --> 02:56:16.092]  I apologize.
[02:56:16.172 --> 02:56:17.613]  I won't do it very often.
[02:56:18.734 --> 02:56:19.514]  God bless you all.
[02:56:19.554 --> 02:56:20.575]  Thanks to everybody.
[02:56:21.396 --> 02:56:23.577]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
