[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:02.573]  I think so.
[00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:22.981]  Well, last hour we talked about the national news that's downbreaking, about the Big Academy of Sciences here in Texas giving a standing ovation and the highest award to a Malthusian who wants to kill 90% of the population.
[00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.145]  We'll get more into that later, even take a few calls on it.
[00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:30.610]  For this next hour, we've got to shift gears into something just as important, an amazing individual,
[00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.653]  I'll have to cover his bio when we get back to the next segment, because some stations don't carry this first segment.
[00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:44.215]  But Dr. Robert N. Bowman is president of the Institute for Space and Security Studies.
[00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:50.398]  He's a former fighter pilot, PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering from Caltech.
[00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:53.459]  He was the head of the Star Wars program.
[00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:56.080]  That's the strategic defense initiative.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.061]  And he is aware of 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:06.656]  So, we'll be talking about a host of issues with him for this hour and into the next, if he would like to grace us.
[00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:10.477]  And we are extremely honored to be joined by Dr. Bowman.
[00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:11.678]  Dr. Bowman, good to have you on.
[00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:12.958]  Thank you very much.
[00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:13.718]  Good to be here.
[00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:14.818]  Thank you.
[00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:15.939]  There's so much to cover.
[00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.559]  Of course, I want to get into 9-11 first.
[00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:24.200]  But, I mean, right now, just tell us about yourself and some of the things you worked on in and out of government.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.481]  Well, I flew 101 combat missions in Vietnam.
[00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.942]  I was project officer on the nuclear-powered B-70.
[00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:43.357]  And I did run the Star Wars programs under Ford and Carter when their existence was secret, and long before they got the false euphemism of Strategic Defense Initiative.
[00:01:43.357 --> 00:01:45.038]  Because it's really offensive.
[00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:45.999]  Absolutely.
[00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:52.462]  And that's what I told the President in 1977 when I was directing the programs.
[00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:55.904]  Boy, there's a lot of stuff up there in orbit right now, isn't there?
[00:01:55.904 --> 00:01:57.845]  There is indeed.
[00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.466]  I think we have been successful to keep
[00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:09.928]  Weapons out of space so far, but you know, I don't know how long we can continue.
[00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:25.260]  Just a side issue, and I want to come back and get right into 9-11 and then into Star Wars and the rest of it, but have you heard of this Dr. Eric R. Bianca, big UT professor, calling for the extermination of 90% of the population?
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.144]  Oh, I've heard some rumblings of stuff, but nothing like that, no.
[00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:38.040]  I tell you, this population control agenda just keeps coming up and up again at very high levels of our government and other governments.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.524]  It seems to me just to be an excuse for destroying freedoms.
[00:02:42.524 --> 00:02:43.725]  Absolutely.
[00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:44.746]  Absolutely.
[00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:57.037]  When I drive through Montana and a lot of this country the way I do, and see the miles and miles and miles of nothing but miles,
[00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:16.280]  Yeah, I have to take this population control thing a little with a grain of salt because we can absorb a lot more people if we don't have all of the resources to support them going to the big corporations and the global robber barons.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.643]  For warmongering an empire.
[00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:19.364]  Yeah, right.
[00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.221]  Of course, you also are the presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
[00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:26.583]  I mean, your bio is so lengthy, but it's important for listeners to hear it.
[00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:32.808]  So we're going to take a three-minute break here, sir, and then we're going to come back and spend the rest of the hour with you.
[00:03:32.808 --> 00:03:36.170]  Dr. Bowman, why don't you give us some of your websites first, though?
[00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.431]  Sure.
[00:03:37.431 --> 00:03:40.133]  RMBowman.com.
[00:03:41.514 --> 00:04:08.239]  is my personal website and there's uh... on that you click on the homepage of space and security news united catholic church my two thousand presidential campaign i have a new website for my congressional campaign and that is bowman two thousand six dot com all right and i you also have a position uh... there uh... as a uh... i would say a a a pastor as well tell us about that
[00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:19.247]  I'm the presiding Archbishop of the United Catholic Church, which is an independent Catholic Church, not under the control of the Vatican.
[00:04:19.247 --> 00:04:23.248]  And does that tie into the Gibsons and others, or is that a separate group?
[00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:23.968]  A separate.
[00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:24.848]  Yeah.
[00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.189]  Alright, so it better be more of a classical Catholic group, correct?
[00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.689]  Right.
[00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.770]  Alright, we'll be right back, Dr. Bowman.
[00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.230]  We're so honored to have you with us.
[00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.571]  We'll go right into 9-11, Star Wars, and a lot more.
[00:04:39.682 --> 00:04:42.784]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:44.705]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:54.571]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:58.733]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:01.914]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:01.914 --> 00:05:06.755]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:11.416]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:18.878]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:21.459]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:40.952]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:43.513]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:06:43.513 --> 00:06:44.553]  New toenails?
[00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:46.534]  What happened to the old ones?
[00:06:46.534 --> 00:06:49.736]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy-looking.
[00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:51.197]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:06:51.197 --> 00:06:54.218]  They were so discolored, really awful-looking.
[00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:56.019]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:57.860]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.261]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:02.282]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:07:02.282 --> 00:07:03.503]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:07:04.102 --> 00:07:05.625]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:10.412]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:11.553]  Ah, so that's it.
[00:07:11.553 --> 00:07:14.377]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:16.000]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:19.978]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[00:07:19.978 --> 00:07:20.738]  You bet!
[00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:25.002]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are gonna look just as good as yours do.
[00:07:25.002 --> 00:07:26.924]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:26.924 --> 00:07:28.226]  Non-X Nail Gel.

[00:07:39.262 --> 00:07:41.384]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:46.287]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:46.287 --> 00:07:48.508]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:48.508 --> 00:07:50.530]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 p.m.
[00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.091]  Central Standard Time.
[00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:54.692]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:57.714]  Going light years beyond the false left-right paradigm.
[00:07:57.714 --> 00:07:58.995]  I am your host.
[00:07:58.995 --> 00:08:01.717]  And we are joined by an amazing individual.
[00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:08.802]  Got a chance to see him on Austin Television a few years ago and meant to get him on then and just somehow drop the ball, but he's with us today.
[00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:14.765]  And we've got links to his bio and links to his website up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:19.188]  We're going to tell you about Dr. Bob Bowman and we're going to go to him.

[00:08:49.388 --> 00:08:52.630]  He is one of the country's foremost authorities on national security.
[00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.151]  and uh... u.s.
[00:08:54.151 --> 00:09:10.076]  air force lieutenant colonel robert bowman former director of the star wars defense program under presidents ford and carter when it was top secret not known of course until nineteen eighty until uh... july eighty two he was vice president of space communications company and just goes on for several pages ladies and gentlemen

[00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:44.324]  Bob Bowman was the first presidential candidate officially recognized by the Reform Party in 1999.
[00:09:44.324 --> 00:09:46.884]  And it goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:46.884 --> 00:09:52.186]  He's renounced NAFTA, GATT, the WTO, globalism, the whole New World Order system.
[00:09:52.186 --> 00:09:55.407]  But he's here today to talk about 9-11 and Star Wars.
[00:09:55.407 --> 00:09:57.608]  So we are honored to have him.
[00:09:57.608 --> 00:10:01.489]  Dr. Bowman, some stations just joined us a few minutes ago.
[00:10:02.316 --> 00:10:06.078]  But let's plunge right into 9-11 and the official 9-11 fable.
[00:10:06.078 --> 00:10:08.920]  Several years ago, you began to speak out about it.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.841]  How did bin Laden make NORAD stand down?
[00:10:10.841 --> 00:10:12.262]  What made the buildings fall?
[00:10:12.262 --> 00:10:17.325]  Building 7, bin Laden's a known CIA asset.
[00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:22.888]  The drills that day, the public officials warned not to fly, the hijackers trained at US military bases.
[00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:24.008]  All of this is admitted.
[00:10:24.008 --> 00:10:26.190]  Give us your take, sir, on September 11th.
[00:10:27.429 --> 00:10:40.138]  Well, first of all, I'm not a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist, and I think the most unbelievable conspiracy of all is the official one told by the U.S.
[00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:44.521]  government.
[00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:46.902]  It's patently impossible from every angle.
[00:10:46.902 --> 00:10:47.783]  Absolutely.
[00:10:47.783 --> 00:10:49.344]  So, you know, yes,
[00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:52.621]  It was a conspiracy.
[00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:54.102]  We know that.
[00:10:54.102 --> 00:11:00.027]  You know, one person can't dream this up in his room and go do it himself.
[00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:03.991]  There were a lot of people involved.
[00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:05.492]  So it was a conspiracy.
[00:11:05.492 --> 00:11:10.036]  The only question is, who were the conspirators?
[00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:16.962]  And that's where I think we disagree with the government and its official conspiracy theory.
[00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:18.800]  Break it down for us.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.221]  I'd like you to go further than you've ever gone with us today.
[00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:23.502]  Millions of people tune in right now to hear you, sir.
[00:11:23.502 --> 00:11:24.882]  I know you've written analysis.
[00:11:24.882 --> 00:11:25.643]  You've spoken on it.
[00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.284]  You're part of the Scholars for Truth.
[00:11:27.284 --> 00:11:30.705]  But, I mean, break down for us from any angle you wish.
[00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:32.026]  Who has the motive?
[00:11:32.026 --> 00:11:33.907]  You know, PNAC called for stuff like this.
[00:11:33.907 --> 00:11:35.688]  Brzezinski said it would be helpful.
[00:11:35.688 --> 00:11:38.949]  I mean, go over from any position you wish to discuss it.
[00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:44.732]  Okay, well, let's say I first got an inkling that something was wrong.
[00:11:45.367 --> 00:12:09.745]  With what we were being told on September 12, 2001, when all of a sudden this government that was so clueless that it had no idea that something like this could possibly happen, was giving us the names and pictures of all of these 19 Arab hijackers.
[00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:19.079]  You know, I thought right then, something is fishy.
[00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:26.581]  And just a quick caveat, Tennant, before the second tower was even hit, is on record telling ABC News it was Bin Laden.
[00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:29.462]  So, in the middle of the attack, they're already saying.
[00:12:29.462 --> 00:12:30.282]  That's right.
[00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:31.503]  That's right.
[00:12:31.503 --> 00:12:35.864]  They've got their Patsy pre-selected.
[00:12:35.864 --> 00:12:40.185]  And, you know, maybe Bin Laden was involved.
[00:12:43.775 --> 00:12:50.677]  Bin Laden and his 19 Arabs were far from the whole picture.
[00:12:50.677 --> 00:12:56.378]  They could not have pulled off something like this and there's just too much evidence.
[00:12:56.378 --> 00:13:09.761]  Another thing that convinced me that we're not being given the truth is the massive cover-up and destruction of evidence by our government.
[00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.242]  If our government has nothing to hide
[00:13:14.082 --> 00:13:17.264]  Why are they hiding all the evidence?
[00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:23.268]  Why are they destroying all of the physical evidence from the World Trade Center?
[00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:28.872]  Why are they confiscating surveillance videos from the Pentagon?
[00:13:28.872 --> 00:13:34.035]  Why are they confiscating and destroying voice tapes from
[00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:39.207]  The air traffic controllers, I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:13:39.207 --> 00:13:47.551]  Compensating the three boxes they found undamaged, firefighters on record, and emergency workers saying the FBI took them out on ATVs.
[00:13:47.551 --> 00:13:55.854]  And, you know, if they don't have anything to hide, show us the evidence.
[00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:57.175]  That's my position.
[00:13:58.503 --> 00:13:59.663]  Well, I mean, let me digress here.
[00:13:59.663 --> 00:14:25.723]  I mean, your 101 combat missions, and you can tell us about the aircraft you flew in Vietnam, and I've interviewed a lot of other airline pilots, current and former fighter pilots, they say that, I mean, these guys couldn't get Cessnas off the ground, admittedly, when they were creating their history, their ledger, there in Florida, they jumped out of a Cessna, unable to get it off the ground, but now they're going to T-bone 75% of their targets in maneuvers that fighter pilots say they couldn't do, but one time out of ten.
[00:14:25.723 --> 00:14:26.223]  Is that accurate?
[00:14:28.237 --> 00:14:29.498]  That sounds accurate.
[00:14:29.498 --> 00:14:39.246]  Now, I haven't actually, uh, you know, I've heard about some of the maneuvers that have been pulled, but, you know, I didn't really see those things come in, whatever they were.
[00:14:39.246 --> 00:14:50.895]  And, uh, I don't know if the maneuvers that, uh, you know, actually happened, but if it's as it has been described,
[00:14:51.317 --> 00:14:59.040]  Then yes, that's a heck of a feat for these Arabs that essentially flunked out of flight school.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:15.706]  But the big thing is, they never would have gotten near those targets if ordinary, common sense, standard procedures had been followed.
[00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:16.386]  You remember
[00:15:17.643 --> 00:15:39.856]  Several years ago, Payne Stewart and his little private plane lost radio contact, so by golly, 16 minutes later there were fighter jets up escorting that thing, making sure that it didn't hit in a
[00:15:40.703 --> 00:15:42.944]  populated area and do some damage.
[00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:43.464]  That's right.
[00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:49.707]  The accounts by the FAA are between 16 and 18 minutes later, five F-16s were shadowing the aircraft.
[00:15:49.707 --> 00:15:58.591]  And, you know, this was standard and such intercepts happened dozens of times in 1981.
[00:15:58.591 --> 00:15:59.011]  Well, yeah.
[00:15:59.011 --> 00:16:00.251]  Well, 67 times in the year before 2001.
[00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:00.791]  That's correct.
[00:16:00.791 --> 00:16:01.292]  And so a lot of
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.822]  People said, why didn't we intercept?
[00:16:11.822 --> 00:16:22.089]  And there were a lot of people at the beginning of the 9-11 Truth Movement that blamed the interceptor pilots and saying, why were they going so slow?
[00:16:22.089 --> 00:16:28.633]  And... It's now come out they were ordered to fly at 350-something miles an hour, F-16 stalling speed.
[00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:38.620]  Well... I haven't seen that, but I did some calculations which, with the timeline,
[00:16:39.338 --> 00:17:04.900]  That shows that from the time they got the word to scramble, because of considerations like takeoff roll, acceleration time, climb time, turn time, effect of altitude on top speed, wind, I see no evidence that the interceptor pilots couldn't have gotten to their targets any faster.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.522]  You can't instantaneously from takeoff
[00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:12.353]  Fly at your top advertised speed of an f-15.
[00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:28.110]  It's just physically impossible But there's a there's a second thing They were scrambled about a half an hour too late and
[00:17:29.942 --> 00:17:31.643]  So they would have been scrambled on time?
[00:17:31.643 --> 00:17:49.558]  If they had been scrambled on time, they could have flown at whatever speed they actually flew at, and they could have intercepted those aircraft before they got to the World Trade Center, and of course, 77, they could have intercepted.
[00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:54.398]  Long before it ever got near the Pentagon or Washington D.C.
[00:17:54.398 --> 00:17:55.038]  at all.
[00:17:55.038 --> 00:17:59.479]  You're talking about like over an hour and a half time to do that.
[00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:00.439]  Absolutely.
[00:18:00.439 --> 00:18:07.321]  So, but slide 11, the first one to hit the World Trade Center, that's the critical thing.
[00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:09.122]  And, you know, standard procedures.
[00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:10.962]  I used to be an interceptor pilot.
[00:18:10.962 --> 00:18:11.782]  I know the drill.
[00:18:11.782 --> 00:18:12.943]  I know how long it takes.
[00:18:12.943 --> 00:18:14.303]  I know what you do.
[00:18:14.303 --> 00:18:18.804]  And the fact of the matter is that when
[00:18:20.663 --> 00:18:33.110]  An airliner, or any other aircraft, goes significantly off course, or it loses voice communications, or the transponder signal is lost.
[00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.150]  There's a scramble.
[00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.511]  There's a scramble.
[00:18:35.511 --> 00:18:36.892]  Any one of those three.
[00:18:36.892 --> 00:18:41.054]  Now in this case, all three of those things happened.
[00:18:42.452 --> 00:18:44.093]  And still there was no scramble.
[00:18:44.093 --> 00:18:46.935]  And by the way, for those that don't know, that is the default setting.
[00:18:46.935 --> 00:18:48.876]  They don't even need orders, it just happens.
[00:18:48.876 --> 00:18:51.137]  That's absolutely right.
[00:18:51.137 --> 00:18:54.659]  They had to be... Countermanded.
[00:18:54.659 --> 00:19:00.182]  Somehow prevented from doing the normal thing.
[00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:10.388]  So if our government, somewhere in our government, if they had just stayed out of it and let normal things happen,
[00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:18.796]  Those aircraft would have been intercepted, the World Trade Centers would still be standing, and thousands of dead Americans would be alive.
[00:19:18.796 --> 00:19:23.100]  Somewhere, treason happened.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.805]  Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, combat pilot Vietnam, 100-plus missions.
[00:19:28.805 --> 00:19:34.790]  He'll be joining us to talk more about 9-11 with his in-depth expertise, and then we'll talk about Star Wars.
[00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.151]  Stay with us, we'll be right back, sir.
[00:19:38.783 --> 00:19:42.529]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:47.216]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:19:47.216 --> 00:19:54.607]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:19:55.014 --> 00:19:59.400]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:12.778]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:20:13.258 --> 00:20:17.039]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of Stem and Hen.
[00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:21.661]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:20:21.661 --> 00:20:24.702]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:20:24.702 --> 00:20:28.063]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:20:28.063 --> 00:20:29.543]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:45.742]  Currency devaluation.
[00:20:45.742 --> 00:20:46.762]  Inflation.
[00:20:46.762 --> 00:20:48.183]  One and the same.
[00:20:48.183 --> 00:20:52.185]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:20:52.185 --> 00:20:54.266]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:20:54.266 --> 00:20:54.807]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:20:54.807 --> 00:20:56.588]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:57.088]  Here is reality.
[00:20:57.088 --> 00:20:59.109]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:13.937 --> 00:21:18.159]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:22.362]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:22.362 --> 00:21:26.424]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:26.424 --> 00:21:27.945]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:27.945 --> 00:21:28.185]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:41.954]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:21:41.954 --> 00:21:45.075]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:51.638]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfalls, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:21:51.638 --> 00:21:59.141]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:21:59.141 --> 00:22:03.143]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophe.
[00:22:03.183 --> 00:22:03.964]  We're good to go!
[00:22:31.087 --> 00:22:32.749]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:22:32.749 --> 00:22:35.453]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[00:22:45.618 --> 00:22:53.740]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.381]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[00:22:56.361 --> 00:22:57.921]  's patented methodology.
[00:22:57.921 --> 00:23:05.123]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[00:23:05.123 --> 00:23:06.463]  At a physician's office.

[00:23:12.886 --> 00:23:14.207]  Or, call LaysMed at 702-953-0267 today.
[00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:13.374]  Welcome back.
[00:24:13.374 --> 00:24:16.154]  Our little message in a bottle.
[00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:18.995]  And the word is getting out.
[00:24:33.766 --> 00:24:35.267]  Dr. Bowman, our guest, short segment.
[00:24:35.267 --> 00:24:36.968]  We'll come back in a long segment and have more time.
[00:24:36.968 --> 00:24:42.351]  Dr. Bowman, continuing with 9-11, I mean, I brought up a few of the facets that concern me.
[00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:47.513]  You know, you talk about whatever really did hit the Pentagon, and that's a whole other area of debate.
[00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:49.674]  But what about all the public officials being warned?
[00:24:49.674 --> 00:24:58.019]  What about Bush, his different think tanks saying, we need terrorist attacks to mobilize the American people?
[00:24:58.019 --> 00:25:02.041]  Dr. Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, who has a motive in all of this?
[00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:32.991]  Well, naturally, you follow the money, but the biggest motive were the neoconservatives that run our government, because they said in a paper beginning around 1991 and continuing, and the paper was revised and published again in 2000, before George W. Bush ever became president,
[00:25:34.555 --> 00:25:51.623]  And, of course, long before 9-11, they published this paper, In Progress for a New American Century, and the authors of that were Libby, Pearl, Wolfowitz, Jeb Bush, all the usual suspects.
[00:25:51.623 --> 00:25:52.643]  Cheney.
[00:25:52.643 --> 00:25:54.504]  Cheney, of course.
[00:25:54.504 --> 00:26:01.948]  And they said in there that the United States must occupy Iraq.
[00:26:03.931 --> 00:26:06.173]  Permanently.
[00:26:06.173 --> 00:26:27.589]  Not just because of Iraq's oil, but to use Iraq as a staging base for the military control of Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, because they think the royal family could get kicked out there, and the southern Russian republics around the Caspian.
[00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:28.950]  And we're talking about
[00:26:29.844 --> 00:26:35.447]  In that area, maybe $2 trillion worth of oil and gas.
[00:26:35.447 --> 00:26:51.515]  And control of those resources and the pipelines through Afghanistan and through Iran and through Bosnia, by the way.
[00:26:51.515 --> 00:26:54.216]  Even Clinton was in on this stuff.
[00:26:57.785 --> 00:27:08.854]  This is an enormous financial incentive for people who are involved in the oil and gas business, and of course that includes practically all the top people in our government.
[00:27:08.854 --> 00:27:18.181]  And then voila, the people who have the motive and have the capability to carry it out magically preside over the entire attack and then get what they want out of it.
[00:27:18.181 --> 00:27:24.866]  Yeah, and of course, in that same PNAC document, which was on their website, I don't know if it's still there, I think they may have
[00:27:25.436 --> 00:27:26.898]  Taking it out or cleaned it up?
[00:27:26.898 --> 00:27:30.142]  No, it's still there, Rebuilding America's Defenses, September 2000.
[00:27:30.142 --> 00:27:44.940]  But in the version that I saw on their website, they admitted in that document that the American people would never stand for this unless there was, to use their phrase, a new Pearl Harbor.
[00:27:45.882 --> 00:27:48.063]  And of course, that's what 9-11 was.
[00:27:48.063 --> 00:27:58.307]  And then Brzezinski in 1997 in the Grand Chess Board said, to mobilize our slaves for a war with the barbarians, we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event on the same scale or larger.
[00:27:58.307 --> 00:28:00.749]  Yeah.
[00:28:00.749 --> 00:28:04.210]  Interesting that 9-11 killed about the exact number that Pearl Harbor did, almost 3,000.
[00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.471]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:13.074]  And, of course, it, you know,
[00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:21.984]  Our government could say, well, this was a case of massive incompetence.
[00:28:21.984 --> 00:28:37.789]  Well, if that is the case, then how come nobody in the chain of command from the top all the way down to the poor pilots flying those interceptors, how come none of them were fired?
[00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:40.090]  None of them were reprimanded.
[00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.871]  None of them were court-martialed.
[00:28:42.358 --> 00:28:50.001]  Matter of fact, the key players in this whole mess were promoted or given medals of freedom.
[00:28:50.001 --> 00:28:53.203]  Yeah, General Myers gets promoted to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:28:53.203 --> 00:28:58.845]  The FBI agents that blocked other FBI agents from, quote, stopping the hijackers got record cash bonuses.
[00:28:58.845 --> 00:29:03.107]  And at the same time, Bush went to the CIA a week after.
[00:29:03.107 --> 00:29:04.708]  Remember the standing ovation?
[00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:06.429]  They acted like they just won the Super Bowl.
[00:29:06.429 --> 00:29:07.189]  Remember that?
[00:29:07.189 --> 00:29:08.009]  Yeah.
[00:29:08.009 --> 00:29:09.510]  I mean, what was that celebration?
[00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:16.714]  Well, uh, they got what they wanted.
[00:29:16.714 --> 00:29:17.675]  They sure did.
[00:29:17.675 --> 00:29:18.275]  Stay there, sir.
[00:29:18.275 --> 00:29:22.378]  I want to come back, talk more about 9-11, and get into Star Wars, and talk about what you're doing right now.
[00:29:22.378 --> 00:29:23.980]  You're trying to do something about all this.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.000]  Folks can help you.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.901]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:28.703]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:29:28.703 --> 00:29:30.104]  We're on the march.
[00:29:30.104 --> 00:29:32.626]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:32.626 --> 00:29:35.308]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:38.596 --> 00:29:44.779]  So you take care of your car, you change the oil, tune it up on a regular basis, and always make sure that it's running at its best.

[00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:41.470]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:55.596]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism, but our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America, and one day we would wake up and have socialism-communism and not even know how it happened.
[00:31:56.411 --> 00:32:01.833]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:07.035]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism-communism and don't even know it.
[00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:09.476]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said.
[00:32:09.476 --> 00:32:17.179]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:32:20.621 --> 00:32:21.281]  Call now.
[00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:23.863]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:32:23.863 --> 00:32:27.786]  The first head and two administrations of the secret Star Wars program during Ford and
[00:32:46.522 --> 00:32:52.527]  Of course, Jimmy Carter, combat fighter pilot, Vietnam, presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
[00:32:52.527 --> 00:32:53.328]  It goes on and on.
[00:32:53.328 --> 00:32:54.789]  Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:32:55.991 --> 00:33:02.456]  But that's coming up here in just a few minutes, and I'm going to try to twist his arm and stay in a few minutes for the next hour so we can get all the questions answered.
[00:33:02.456 --> 00:33:03.516]  I know there's a lot of callers.
[00:33:03.516 --> 00:33:07.819]  We haven't been taking calls lately, but I'll take a few before this segment right now ends.
[00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:11.362]  Before we go back to our guests, I didn't plug it last hour, so I better do it right now.
[00:33:11.362 --> 00:33:12.562]  I've made 14 films.
[00:33:12.562 --> 00:33:14.484]  They're some of the best out there, bar none.
[00:33:14.484 --> 00:33:17.306]  I was the first to expose 9-11 two months before it happened.
[00:33:17.306 --> 00:33:18.567]  I've never done it before or since.
[00:33:18.567 --> 00:33:21.168]  I said, call the White House, tell them, don't attack the World Trade Center.
[00:33:21.168 --> 00:33:23.230]  That's the type of sources I got at the Pentagon, okay?
[00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.271]  It's on record, videos in my film, Masters of Terror.
[00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:32.594]  I've made Martial Law, my newest and most powerful film on 9-11, and it covers wide spectrum data.
[00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:40.818]  Prior knowledge, motive, how they did it, why they did it, what they did, their history, other government-sponsored terror events.
[00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:45.941]  They're the most effective at waking people up, because we just don't focus on one or two issues, we focus on hundreds.
[00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:47.802]  Rapid fire.
[00:33:47.802 --> 00:33:49.903]  Get Martial Law, it's three hours long.
[00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:52.712]  It's really three films in one.
[00:33:52.712 --> 00:33:54.614]  Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police.
[00:33:54.614 --> 00:33:55.855]  They get the classic.
[00:33:55.855 --> 00:33:58.357]  The film I made just two months after 9-11.
[00:33:58.357 --> 00:33:59.938]  We had a second edition six months after.
[00:33:59.938 --> 00:34:01.219]  That's the one we carry today.
[00:34:01.219 --> 00:34:02.940]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.241]  Still one of the preeminent films.
[00:34:04.241 --> 00:34:05.402]  A lot of you haven't seen it.
[00:34:05.402 --> 00:34:06.383]  You need to have it.
[00:34:06.383 --> 00:34:09.445]  Of course, then there's the film, The Masters of Terror, that I produced on the subject.
[00:34:09.445 --> 00:34:11.427]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:34:11.427 --> 00:34:15.650]  Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order.
[00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.154]  Then there's a Synthetic Chair 9-1-1 made in the USA by Webster Tarpley.
[00:34:20.154 --> 00:34:21.155]  We carry that.
[00:34:21.155 --> 00:34:23.277]  We carry a lot of other books and videos.
[00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.800]  The materials you need.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:33.664]  So go to the online video and bookstore at www.InfoWars.com and get those books and videos and make copies.
[00:34:33.664 --> 00:34:38.108]  My films are open for you to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:34:38.108 --> 00:34:39.169]  Aram on AXS TV.
[00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:40.470]  I want to thank those that have.
[00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:41.511]  It's had a huge effect.
[00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:42.892]  Or you can simply call toll-free.
[00:34:42.892 --> 00:34:44.873]  They can answer your questions and take your order.
[00:34:44.873 --> 00:34:47.555]  We've got a bunch of big discounts we're running right now and specials.
[00:34:47.555 --> 00:34:48.816]  Be sure and ask about the specials.
[00:34:51.596 --> 00:34:51.736]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:34:51.736 --> 00:34:52.237]  That's 888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:34:52.237 --> 00:34:54.721]  And we're just running this for a few more days.
[00:34:54.721 --> 00:34:57.766]  Just a few more days and we're going to close up the Spring Special.
[00:35:05.379 --> 00:35:10.740]  You get 5 plus months, almost half a year free at PrisonPlanet.tv when you get a year membership.

[00:35:40.527 --> 00:35:47.130]  Go to his website and see the things he's up to right now with his valiant stand against the globalists and the New World Order.
[00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:54.874]  Going back to our guest, just spelling it out, Dr. Bowman,
[00:35:56.804 --> 00:36:08.386]  9-11, the changes that have happened in America, how they were ready with sweeping legislation that has nothing to do with stopping, quote, terrorists, if they even exist outside of intelligence agencies' handling or creation.
[00:36:08.386 --> 00:36:16.148]  Looking at what America's turned into today, isn't that just more evidence of who the real perpetrators of 9-11 are?
[00:36:16.148 --> 00:36:20.208]  Well, I would certainly think so.
[00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:47.392]  Way back when, I used to be a conservative Republican, and there were conservative Republicans then like Bob Taft, and he was called Mr. Republican, and he stood for three main things.
[00:36:47.392 --> 00:36:50.534]  Number one was fiscal responsibility.
[00:36:51.781 --> 00:36:56.985]  Number two was avoiding foreign military entanglements.
[00:36:56.985 --> 00:37:02.810]  And number three was protecting the individual rights of Americans.
[00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:05.772]  Now, that's what a conservative Republican used to be.
[00:37:05.772 --> 00:37:12.917]  We don't have any of those in our government now, because these guys have done all just the opposite.
[00:37:12.917 --> 00:37:19.903]  Fiscal responsibility is taking a surplus and turning it into the biggest deficit in our history, fiscally responsible.
[00:37:20.399 --> 00:37:22.962]  And of course, foreign military entanglements.
[00:37:22.962 --> 00:37:36.015]  Never has our military been stretched so thin and sacrificed so much to do so little except for the big money interests.
[00:37:36.015 --> 00:37:39.979]  And thirdly, of course, what you are alluding to is individual rights.
[00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:51.557]  This administration with their Patriot Act, which they rammed through after 9-11 and most of the people in Congress didn't even get a chance to read it.
[00:37:51.557 --> 00:37:57.201]  This has done more to destroy the rights of Americans than all of our enemies combined.
[00:37:59.827 --> 00:38:01.007]  I agree with you.
[00:38:01.007 --> 00:38:09.030]  Getting back to 9-11, I mean, just stating it on the record, in your gut, from all the analysis you've done, you've already said their official story is impossible.
[00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:15.333]  Clearly, sir, I mean, from all the evidence you've got, if you were a police officer, if you were a detective, who would you investigate?
[00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:19.054]  Who do you believe carried 9-11 out?
[00:38:19.054 --> 00:38:26.657]  Well, if I had to narrow it down to one person, of course, I think my prime suspect would be Dick Cheney.
[00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:40.219]  But the fact of the matter is that there needs to be a true independent investigation, not the kind of sham investigations that we have
[00:38:40.911 --> 00:38:44.134]  Yeah, well, that so-called 9-11 Commission omitted
[00:39:07.034 --> 00:39:18.743]  Anything that might be the least bit suspicious or embarrassing or in any way detract from the official conspiracy theory.
[00:39:18.743 --> 00:39:21.725]  So it was a total whitewash.
[00:39:21.725 --> 00:39:23.086]  Here's a better way for me to ask the question.
[00:39:23.086 --> 00:39:24.127]  And unbelievable.
[00:39:24.127 --> 00:39:29.951]  Who is the only group, who are the only groups, what are the only organizations that can carry out something on the scale of 9-11?
[00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:30.171]  Well,
[00:39:36.641 --> 00:40:00.795]  You see, where I'm coming from is I don't believe that we have the evidence to know whether Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda was involved and the people in our government simply got wind of it and capitalized on it and made sure that nobody interfered with it.
[00:40:00.795 --> 00:40:00.955]  Or if
[00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:06.744]  The thing was planned from beginning to end.
[00:40:06.744 --> 00:40:08.907]  Well, what you just said, the first thing is bare minimum.
[00:40:08.907 --> 00:40:10.890]  I mean, the first thing is bare minimum.
[00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.553]  Bare minimum, that's right.
[00:40:13.553 --> 00:40:21.123]  We don't know if it's even worse than that, that it was totally planned and carried out by people other than
[00:40:22.102 --> 00:40:25.024]  The people who were in that military chain of command, from the evidence that I've seen,
[00:40:52.302 --> 00:41:08.545]  I'm not sure that any of them below the people directly involved with the White House, I don't believe that any of the people in the military chain of command necessarily knew what was going on.
[00:41:08.545 --> 00:41:14.026]  They could have been all innocent tools of the people that were pulling the strings.
[00:41:14.026 --> 00:41:16.407]  Is that why the drills were used to confuse everybody?
[00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:18.247]  The drills, absolutely.
[00:41:18.897 --> 00:41:46.125]  Those exercises that went on that morning simulating the exact kind of thing that was in fact happening so confused the people in the FAA and NORAD and whatnot that they didn't know what was real and what was part of the exercise and I think that the people that
[00:41:47.586 --> 00:41:55.349]  Planned and directed and carried out those exercises.
[00:41:55.349 --> 00:42:01.611]  They're the ones that should be the object of investigation.
[00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:05.552]  I don't want to prejudge who was guilty.
[00:42:05.552 --> 00:42:17.016]  After all, I'm running for Congress and I'm hoping when I get to Congress to get a real investigation going to raise questions and
[00:42:17.623 --> 00:42:22.124]  I don't want to be presumptuous and get up there and say, I have the answers.
[00:42:22.124 --> 00:42:34.727]  What I want to do is to get up there and prove that we don't know the answers and that the official answers we've been given are impossible.
[00:42:34.727 --> 00:42:38.008]  We've got to dig deeper and we've got to look elsewhere.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:45.446]  And see if we can get a real investigation going that can eventually prove who was responsible.
[00:42:45.446 --> 00:42:46.206]  That sounds good to me.
[00:43:00.856 --> 00:43:06.939]  Well, I mean, I appreciate your courage in even going this far and saying the whole thing's a fraud and that your main suspect is Dick Cheney.
[00:43:06.939 --> 00:43:08.260]  That's extremely strong.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.481]  What about the police officer?
[00:43:09.481 --> 00:43:23.088]  What about the FBI agent listening right now, who's a good person themselves, Dr. Bowman, so they can't believe that other people in government or in the system, in the black world, could be involved in something like this?
[00:43:23.088 --> 00:43:25.289]  What would you say to those naive souls out there?
[00:43:26.676 --> 00:43:38.003]  Well, there were a lot of FBI people that did their jobs and reported things that got absorbed into the system somehow and got never acted on.
[00:43:38.003 --> 00:43:45.568]  Yeah, they specifically said, these guys are hijackers, they're going to attack the World Trade Center, and they were ordered, you'll be arrested if you don't drop this case.
[00:43:45.568 --> 00:43:46.789]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:46.789 --> 00:43:54.334]  And so, to those folks that were trying to do their job and protect this country, I say, you know,
[00:43:55.672 --> 00:44:05.038]  Keep doing your job and protect this country by blowing the whistle and investigating the real perpetrators.
[00:44:05.038 --> 00:44:12.442]  If they would have blown the whistle publicly and gone ahead and gone to jail, we might have seen 3,000 people still alive.
[00:44:12.442 --> 00:44:19.086]  Well, that's possible, but you know, I've been a whistleblower myself and I know it's very, very difficult.
[00:44:19.711 --> 00:44:30.015]  And I've been the subject of attempted bribery, attempted blackmail, phone taps, CIA harassment, FBI, IRS, and death threats.
[00:44:30.015 --> 00:44:32.216]  And so I know what can happen.
[00:44:32.216 --> 00:44:33.036]  Oh, I know, too, sir.
[00:44:33.036 --> 00:44:40.558]  I've experienced, and I wasn't the head of the Star Wars program, the most classified government program we know of in existence for six years, as you were.
[00:44:40.558 --> 00:44:41.899]  But let me bring this up.
[00:44:42.939 --> 00:44:48.002]  A lot of experts believe, a lot of other prominent people are going public.
[00:44:48.002 --> 00:44:55.165]  They believe that the globalists are going to carry out another terror attack in the western world very soon because their entire agenda is stalling.
[00:44:55.165 --> 00:45:00.628]  We also have gotten a Republican memo saying they quote, need another 9-11 or they're cooked.
[00:45:00.628 --> 00:45:03.949]  Yeah, yeah, I can see that.
[00:45:03.949 --> 00:45:04.970]  And I hope they
[00:45:06.576 --> 00:45:07.836]  Can't pull it off.
[00:45:07.836 --> 00:45:15.339]  I hope that they are prevented from pulling it off, but I know darn good and well they'd like to have another one.
[00:45:15.339 --> 00:45:18.520]  You think they're scared, though, because so many people are pointing the finger at them?
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.762]  I mean, I think that's really, has already held back an attack.
[00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:26.503]  Quite possibly.
[00:45:26.503 --> 00:45:33.086]  It, you know, they fooled most of the American people once, but
[00:45:36.234 --> 00:45:38.515]  I don't know whether they could ever get away with it again.
[00:45:38.515 --> 00:45:39.976]  Well, most of them, not much.
[00:45:39.976 --> 00:45:44.178]  But privately, I haven't gotten any disagreement from any of them on the things that I'm saying.
[00:45:57.302 --> 00:45:57.702]  Same thing.
[00:45:57.702 --> 00:46:06.124]  I mean, I personally know current airline pilots that are flying 777s and stuff, and they just go, of course it was an inside job, but they won't say it publicly.
[00:46:06.124 --> 00:46:07.505]  That's right.
[00:46:07.505 --> 00:46:14.687]  They want to hang on to their jobs and protect their families and all the rest of it, and I understand that.
[00:46:14.687 --> 00:46:19.748]  But I mean, what's going to happen when national polls show the majority of Americans are saying inside job now, Doctor?
[00:46:25.305 --> 00:46:36.650]  The problem is we don't have anybody in Congress that's capable of making and willing to make enough noise to get something to really happen.
[00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.331]  Well, Ron Paul tries.
[00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:44.093]  Oh yeah, Ron Paul tries and we've got a few courageous people on both sides of the aisle.
[00:46:44.093 --> 00:46:45.054]  Cynthia McKinney.
[00:46:45.054 --> 00:46:45.974]  Cynthia McKinney.
[00:46:45.974 --> 00:46:48.015]  And now they're trying to arrest her.
[00:46:48.015 --> 00:46:51.877]  And, you know, we have a handful of
[00:46:55.305 --> 00:47:04.452]  Women Democrats up there to augment the courage of Ron Paul.
[00:47:04.452 --> 00:47:16.641]  But to be honest, I don't see... Is it only the Democratic women that have the cojones to do something?
[00:47:16.641 --> 00:47:18.382]  It's a strange situation.
[00:47:18.382 --> 00:47:21.645]  But things may change.
[00:47:21.645 --> 00:47:22.806]  There are now
[00:47:24.185 --> 00:47:39.595]  72 of us, well as of two weeks ago when I was up in Washington D.C., there were 72 of us who are the Fighting Dems, the Band of Brothers, all combat veterans, all running for Congress for the first time.
[00:47:41.234 --> 00:47:44.475]  Uh, and all running against the Iraq War.
[00:47:44.475 --> 00:47:45.376]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:47:45.376 --> 00:47:48.237]  What do you think of this gaggle of chicken hawks?
[00:47:48.237 --> 00:47:51.678]  I mean, you had Sam Missile shooting at you in AAA.
[00:47:51.678 --> 00:47:55.599]  I mean, 101 missions, as highly decorated as it gets for the Air Force.
[00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:58.120]  I mean, it's highly decorated until the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:04.823]  What is it like for you to then just see these little wimpy chicken hawks running around talking tough and saying, bring it on?
[00:48:06.266 --> 00:48:09.007]  Well, that's why I'm doing what I'm doing.
[00:48:09.007 --> 00:48:12.789]  I really didn't want to run for office again.
[00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:23.013]  I tried to find somebody younger and healthier, but when it came right down to it, there wasn't anybody else.
[00:48:23.013 --> 00:48:32.117]  Nobody else that was capable, willing, had the information I've got, and so I just had
[00:48:33.294 --> 00:48:38.135]  Put my money where my mouth was and say, okay, I will run.
[00:48:38.135 --> 00:48:49.539]  And the Democrats pleaded with me to take their nomination because the incumbent Republican is one of those that just does whatever Bush and Karl Rove tells them to do.
[00:48:49.539 --> 00:48:52.119]  Tell us where you're running and how folks can support you.
[00:48:52.119 --> 00:48:57.301]  Well, I'm running in Florida District 15 against Dave Weldon.
[00:48:58.877 --> 00:49:14.964]  The way people can support me is simply by going to my website, Bowman2006.com, and reading the issues and whatnot that I stand for, and sending me money.
[00:49:14.964 --> 00:49:19.466]  We've got a PayPal link right on there, or they can just fire off a check and mail it to me.
[00:49:19.466 --> 00:49:21.888]  Well, I can think of no better type candidate than yourself.
[00:49:21.888 --> 00:49:25.169]  We need more people in there that know what's happening.
[00:49:25.169 --> 00:49:26.410]  Well, I appreciate that.
[00:49:27.429 --> 00:49:35.472]  We've raised about $7,000 so far, and my incumbent opponent has a war chest between $4 and $5 million.
[00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:40.514]  Now, we're not going to match that, and frankly, I'm not even going to try.
[00:49:40.514 --> 00:49:53.600]  But we need enough money to get the message out to the people of this district, to make them aware of the issues, and to give them a choice, a chance to really vote.
[00:49:55.213 --> 00:50:01.399]  If you're not the incumbent, nobody knows your name, and it's very, very difficult.
[00:50:01.399 --> 00:50:04.241]  Last time around, this incumbent won by a 2-1 margin.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.382]  That's not going to happen again, I can guarantee you.
[00:50:08.382 --> 00:50:13.547]  But I think we have a real chance of winning this game, if we get a little help.
[00:50:13.547 --> 00:50:15.909]  Well, Ron Paul has said we need to remove the Republicans.
[00:50:15.909 --> 00:50:19.713]  He says we've got to check this executive monopoly that's formed.
[00:50:19.713 --> 00:50:21.394]  I mean, Bush is saying it's above the law.
[00:50:21.394 --> 00:50:30.863]  And all of the lily-livered Democrats that supported the President in the war and all this other stuff as well are too chicken to stand up about 9-11.
[00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:31.963]  Stay there, sir.
[00:50:31.963 --> 00:50:38.487]  We're taking a call from Ron in New York when we get back, and I hope to twist your arm to stay a little bit more with us to talk about Star Wars.
[00:50:38.487 --> 00:50:43.009]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:43.009 --> 00:50:47.592]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:47.592 --> 00:50:51.994]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:51.994 --> 00:50:53.335]  The New World Order.
[00:50:55.129 --> 00:50:59.412]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:59.412 --> 00:51:06.477]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:08.879]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:08.879 --> 00:51:19.486]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:19.486 --> 00:51:21.608]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[00:51:21.988 --> 00:51:25.330]  My new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!
[00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.853]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:28.853 --> 00:51:29.273]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:29.273 --> 00:51:30.394]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:51:39.915 --> 00:51:51.401]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:51:51.401 --> 00:51:54.903]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:51:55.163 --> 00:51:59.664]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:51:59.664 --> 00:52:03.825]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:52:03.825 --> 00:52:10.567]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:10.567 --> 00:52:16.288]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:16.288 --> 00:52:20.869]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[00:52:21.129 --> 00:52:23.432]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:27.639]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:27.639 --> 00:52:30.122]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:30.122 --> 00:52:31.064]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:52:39.358 --> 00:52:39.978]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.244 --> 00:53:02.784]  I think so.
[00:53:24.179 --> 00:53:27.422]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:27.422 --> 00:53:42.294]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:53:42.294 --> 00:53:46.998]  We moved the network last week up in Minnesota to new, bigger, better offices.
[00:53:48.727 --> 00:53:59.994]  So I didn't do the first few days of the week, so I didn't skip Friday to go confront Chairman Keene up in Georgetown when he was talking to the Southwestern University there.
[00:53:59.994 --> 00:54:11.981]  But I did send some of my crew, and we've got an amazing video report that's going to be going up later this afternoon on Infowars.com and a text report that we're going to put together about what happened.
[00:54:11.981 --> 00:54:13.162]  But Bob Dacey,
[00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:20.253]  I know he's waiting in the wings, local TV host, one of my progeny in the fight against the Globalist.
[00:54:20.253 --> 00:54:26.497]  I'm very proud of that because he's very astute and now writes articles for national publications about the Globalist.
[00:54:26.497 --> 00:54:32.400]  I asked Bob to come on the last 30 minutes of the show, because I know he's called in, so I can play some of these clips.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.022]  We have five clips coming up near the end of the broadcast.
[00:54:35.802 --> 00:54:38.324]  And so we can play those short clips and get Bob's take on that.
[00:54:38.324 --> 00:54:39.405]  So we'll see if we can do that.
[00:54:39.405 --> 00:54:41.646]  Right now, Ron in New York's been holding for eons.
[00:54:41.646 --> 00:54:42.887]  I'm not going to take any other calls, folks.
[00:54:42.887 --> 00:54:43.788]  We don't have time.
[00:54:43.788 --> 00:54:48.571]  And our guest, Dr. Bowman, is going to stay with us graciously 20 minutes into the next hour.
[00:54:48.571 --> 00:54:52.134]  But Ron in New York, I know you're chomping at the bit to talk.
[00:54:52.134 --> 00:54:52.734]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:54:52.734 --> 00:54:53.675]  You're on the air.
[00:54:53.675 --> 00:54:55.416]  Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[00:54:55.416 --> 00:54:57.778]  I have several things that I want to touch on.
[00:54:57.778 --> 00:55:04.883]  They may be different, but I want to ask the audience to use its comparative logic to come to an intelligent conclusion.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:11.223]  First off, the doctor had mentioned that they're waiting for another event to occur.
[00:55:11.223 --> 00:55:16.606]  Well, we all know if we've been watching TV this weekend that the heat has been turned up on Iran.
[00:55:16.606 --> 00:55:22.390]  I watch news reports in which all of a sudden Iran is supposed to have this missile torpedo.
[00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:28.774]  The unembedded press reports that there are rumors coming out of 10 Downing Street of the United States.
[00:55:29.514 --> 00:55:33.215]  No, I mean, they're saying that Iran is going to be attacked.
[00:55:33.215 --> 00:55:36.517]  It may be this month or next year, but it's going to come.
[00:55:36.517 --> 00:55:38.017]  200 sites are going to get slammed.
[00:55:38.017 --> 00:55:45.580]  And they're claiming they have super EMP bombs like Saddam's rail gun, just more Buck Rogers bull.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.401]  Do you have a comment or question for Dr. Bowman?
[00:55:48.965 --> 00:55:56.232]  Well, I would like to solicit the doctor's comment, but I also would like to get on to some other points that are very important.
[00:55:56.232 --> 00:55:57.533]  Okay, well that's one question on that.
[00:55:57.533 --> 00:55:58.514]  What's the next point?
[00:55:58.514 --> 00:56:00.516]  Okay, the next point is this.
[00:56:00.516 --> 00:56:06.761]  As reported in the New York Times Magazine on March the 12th, six degrees of separation.
[00:56:06.761 --> 00:56:10.445]  The government is coming up very soon with a new matrix database system.
[00:56:11.107 --> 00:56:16.288]  In which basically the standard set for it is that everybody will appear culpable in being there.
[00:56:16.288 --> 00:56:23.109]  Now the amazing thing about it, and I ask your audience to consider on the face of it how preposterous this is.
[00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:31.331]  The NSA has a database in which they say 325,000 people in this country are potential terrorists.
[00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:38.932]  Now if you were to believe that 325,000 people in the United States are terrorists, then you would have to buy into a preposterous belief
[00:56:39.492 --> 00:56:49.900]  That we have an army of terrorists on American soil that is almost three times or more than three times the size of the American army on the ground in Iraq.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:51.882]  And for four and a half years they haven't struck us.
[00:56:51.882 --> 00:56:55.244]  And then you look at the London bombing and that was clearly MI5, MI6.
[00:56:55.244 --> 00:56:57.366]  That's now been confirmed conclusively.
[00:56:57.366 --> 00:56:58.487]  Dr. Bowman, thanks for the call.
[00:56:58.487 --> 00:57:00.889]  Ron, can you comment on both those points?
[00:57:00.889 --> 00:57:05.792]  Well, I believe that they want very much to attack Iran and
[00:57:07.439 --> 00:57:10.301]  We've got to prevent that.
[00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:25.288]  I would like, with some of the time that we have left, to comment on what is going on now in Iraq and what we should do about that and how that dovetails into preventing an attack against Iran.
[00:57:25.288 --> 00:57:30.651]  What do you think about all these databases tracking Americans, the Real ID Act?
[00:57:30.651 --> 00:57:35.334]  Well, that goes along with the whole Patriot Act and trying to
[00:57:36.845 --> 00:57:43.168]  Limit the freedoms of the American people and it's the kind of thing that we should not allow.
[00:57:43.168 --> 00:57:46.889]  Ron Paul, many others have said we're in danger of a dictatorship and a total takeover.
[00:57:46.889 --> 00:57:47.969]  Do you agree?
[00:57:47.969 --> 00:57:49.330]  I do indeed.
[00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:58.834]  I think there's been nothing closer to fascism than what we've seen lately from this government.
[00:57:58.834 --> 00:58:03.975]  Do you believe they're attempting to perfect a literal dictatorship?
[00:58:03.975 --> 00:58:05.116]  It certainly appears that way.
[00:58:06.045 --> 00:58:06.685]  All right, Doctor.
[00:58:06.685 --> 00:58:06.985]  Stay there.
[00:58:06.985 --> 00:58:07.826]  We'll get into Iraq.
[00:58:07.826 --> 00:58:08.786]  We'll get into Iran.
[00:58:08.786 --> 00:58:11.047]  We'll get in before you leave to Star Wars.
[00:58:11.047 --> 00:58:13.148]  I've got a few questions for you on that.
[00:58:13.148 --> 00:58:14.428]  We've got him for 20 more minutes.
[00:58:14.428 --> 00:58:18.610]  Third hour starts in 70 seconds.
[00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:22.851]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:28.522 --> 00:58:32.264]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:32.264 --> 00:58:35.865]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:35.865 --> 00:58:40.027]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:58:40.027 --> 00:58:46.590]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:54.493]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:58:54.913 --> 00:59:00.416]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:59:00.416 --> 00:59:04.559]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:04.559 --> 00:59:06.460]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:08.881]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:08.881 --> 00:59:13.564]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:59:13.564 --> 00:59:19.307]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:19.307 --> 00:59:19.647]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:30.992]  4438, protect your family.
[00:59:30.992 --> 00:59:33.372]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:33.372 --> 00:59:38.034]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.034 --> 00:59:39.094]  Big Brother.
[00:59:44.093 --> 00:59:45.854]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:45.854 --> 00:59:47.615]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:47.615 --> 00:59:49.196]  You want answers?
[00:59:49.196 --> 00:59:50.117]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:50.117 --> 00:59:54.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:54.940 --> 01:00:00.444]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:08.389]  We're now to the third and final hour of this live Monday, April 3rd, 2006 edition, first broadcast of the new month.
[01:00:10.211 --> 01:00:15.316]  And the former head of the Star Wars program, Dr. Robert M. Bowman, joins us.
[01:00:15.316 --> 01:00:18.338]  He's been a presidential candidate on the reform ticket.
[01:00:18.338 --> 01:00:21.341]  He is also running for Congress right now in Florida.
[01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:26.745]  All of his websites, Bowman2006 and others, are up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:00:26.745 --> 01:00:28.047]  He'll be with us now for the next 20 minutes.
[01:00:29.156 --> 01:00:34.777]  Getting into his views on Iraq, Iran, and what's really happening over in Iraq.
[01:00:34.777 --> 01:00:38.358]  And then before he leaves us, I've also got a few questions about Inside Star Wars.
[01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:46.060]  And then we've got Bob Dacey joining us in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast to talk about his confrontation with Chairman Keene last Friday with my crew as well.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:52.061]  We'll have some audio clips of part of his speech, the question and answer, all of it, the press conference, it's just amazing stuff.
[01:00:52.061 --> 01:00:53.882]  So that's coming up in T-minus 29 minutes.
[01:00:55.882 --> 01:00:58.144]  Right now, going back to Dr. Bowman, you've got the floor, sir.
[01:00:58.144 --> 01:01:02.468]  Give us your view on Iraq, where it's going, where Iran's going.
[01:01:02.468 --> 01:01:04.990]  Okay.
[01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:13.357]  I joined the Air Force to protect our borders and our people, not the financial interests of Folgers, Chiquita Banana, Exxon, and Halliburton.
[01:01:13.357 --> 01:01:16.119]  I think we've had enough corporate wars.
[01:01:16.119 --> 01:01:17.741]  That's what Iraq is.
[01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:24.146]  I say no more Iraqs, no more El Salvador's, no more Kosovo's, no more Columbia's, and no Iran.
[01:01:24.986 --> 01:01:29.328]  You know, these are not isolated incidents of stupidity.
[01:01:29.328 --> 01:01:37.393]  They're part of a long, bloody history of foreign policy being conducted for the financial interests of the wealthy few.
[01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:39.914]  And it's a new form of colonialism.
[01:01:39.914 --> 01:01:41.735]  It violates our Constitution.
[01:01:41.735 --> 01:01:43.556]  It endangers our people.
[01:01:43.556 --> 01:01:44.977]  It mortgages our future.
[01:01:44.977 --> 01:01:46.758]  It wastes our youth.
[01:01:46.758 --> 01:01:48.478]  And it is treason.
[01:01:48.478 --> 01:01:49.499]  And it must be stopped.
[01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:52.195]  And it destroys the good name of America.
[01:01:52.195 --> 01:01:53.516]  Absolutely.
[01:01:53.516 --> 01:01:54.337]  Absolutely.
[01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:56.679]  We're being isolated in the world.
[01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:59.101]  We're an outcast among the nations.
[01:01:59.101 --> 01:02:04.405]  We're the number one rogue nation on Earth.
[01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:14.653]  Well, people ask me, you know, why on Earth I'm running for Congress, Democrat, down here in Florida.
[01:02:14.653 --> 01:02:18.196]  As a pilot who flew 101 combat missions in Vietnam,
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:26.886]  I swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and that includes a renegade president.
[01:02:26.886 --> 01:02:38.174]  I think it's time for George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, and the whole oil mafia to be removed from office and indicted for treason.
[01:02:38.174 --> 01:02:42.117]  And if I get elected to Congress, I'm going to go in that direction.
[01:02:42.873 --> 01:02:50.738]  We owe it to the men and women serving in Iraq to end our occupation, restore our credibility and honor, and bring them home.
[01:02:50.738 --> 01:02:57.983]  And the only way to do that is to give up control of the Iraqi oil, give up control of the rebuilding contracts,
[01:02:58.729 --> 01:03:02.792]  And give up the 14 permanent military bases we're building in Iraq.
[01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:08.096]  Those are the three reasons that we went into Iraq in the first place.
[01:03:08.096 --> 01:03:09.397]  Why are they so arrogant?
[01:03:09.397 --> 01:03:14.960]  I mean, they know that 70 plus percent are now against them and they just seem to have more hubris than ever.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.404]  Well, you know, those things are what they really went to war for in the first place.
[01:03:19.404 --> 01:03:24.927]  It was the reason for 9-11 is to give them an excuse to go into Iraq.
[01:03:24.927 --> 01:03:25.608]  It was their
[01:03:26.215 --> 01:03:28.376]  You know, New Pearl Harbor.
[01:03:28.376 --> 01:03:34.538]  And they're not going to get out unless they're forced out.
[01:03:34.538 --> 01:03:55.645]  If we had a Congress that served the needs of the American people and served the Constitution of the United States, instead of giving an appointed president a blank check to go in there, the members of Congress would say, hell no, and they would refuse any money to continue that war.
[01:03:56.112 --> 01:04:12.675]  What they can do now is say, we will provide money for armor for our troops, we'll provide money for safely extracting them from that quagmire while they're still alive, but we will not appropriate another dime
[01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:18.515]  To go over there and get our troops killed for your oil.
[01:04:18.515 --> 01:04:19.115]  Bravo!
[01:04:19.115 --> 01:04:19.716]  We got a break.
[01:04:19.716 --> 01:04:23.699]  We'll come back with our final segment with Dr. Bowman.
[01:04:23.699 --> 01:04:30.644]  We'll get more into Iraq, more into Iran, and how to stop these neocons and their democratic accomplices on the other side.

[01:04:39.597 --> 01:04:42.698]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:04:42.698 --> 01:04:44.619]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:49.620]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.481]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:58.883]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:58.883 --> 01:05:01.804]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:05:01.804 --> 01:05:06.425]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:06.905]  We're good to go.

[01:05:38.919 --> 01:05:40.659]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:40.659 --> 01:05:44.920]  You know, Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.861]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:54.542]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:54.642 --> 01:05:55.082]  I think so.
[01:06:10.452 --> 01:06:11.173]  We're good to go.
[01:06:38.493 --> 01:06:40.955]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:53.263]  Did you know that a semi-secret organization called the Council on Foreign Relations was founded in 1921 by Marxist Colonel Edward Mandel House, who was the personal advisor to President Woodrow Wilson?
[01:06:53.263 --> 01:06:58.667]  Its objective was to capture the foreign policy section of the State Department to help direct U.S.
[01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:02.450]  influence in the overthrow of targeted nations for communism.
[01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:08.314]  They were successful in the overthrow of Cuba and the Union of South Africa and many others.
[01:07:08.314 --> 01:07:12.458]  They control foreign policy in America this very moment in time.
[01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:22.526]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass and how they'll affect you by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.442]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:55.225]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:55.225 --> 01:07:59.287]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:04.171 --> 01:08:12.216]  Engaging the global control freaks, the corporatists, the global fascists that fund both sides of the political paradigm.
[01:08:12.216 --> 01:08:16.098]  Engaging them at point-blank range in the info war.
[01:08:16.098 --> 01:08:21.661]  Smashing their capital ships that pump out the lies, discrediting their frauds.
[01:08:21.661 --> 01:08:27.885]  More and more people coming forward, speaking out, calling for treason charges, calling for the arrest of these criminals.
[01:08:28.524 --> 01:08:36.211]  We're trying to derail an attempt at a Nazi Germany slash Sovietized style takeover of the planet.
[01:08:36.211 --> 01:08:39.675]  Make no mistake, that's all those were in the past were other examples of empire.
[01:08:40.601 --> 01:08:44.863]  And we are here with this neo-colonialism where we're being colonized as well.
[01:08:44.863 --> 01:08:47.363]  So many Americans think, oh yeah, we are getting our oil.
[01:08:47.363 --> 01:08:50.044]  I hear them on talk radio, but good, we're the empire.
[01:08:50.044 --> 01:08:51.185]  As if you're part of that.
[01:08:51.185 --> 01:08:51.845]  No!
[01:08:51.845 --> 01:08:53.405]  You're going to have your pension funds taken.
[01:08:53.405 --> 01:08:59.788]  You're going to have your taxes taken to pay for multinational corporations to go around raping everyone.
[01:08:59.788 --> 01:09:09.111]  It's our final segment with Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of Star Wars program, and he's running for Congress right now.
[01:09:10.382 --> 01:09:15.644]  He's exposed 9-11, talking about the inside job and all the evidence that points at that in the last hour.
[01:09:15.644 --> 01:09:17.625]  Powerful revelations.
[01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:21.387]  We've got links to his different websites at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:09:22.934 --> 01:09:37.081]  Sir, talking about global empire, talking about these global corporations, they've got to know that they're endangering the entire stability of the planet and our very civilization by their wild gambles for more power and control.
[01:09:37.081 --> 01:09:38.862]  Do you think they'll be able to attack Iran?
[01:09:38.862 --> 01:09:42.143]  Do you think they're going to be able to get that launched?
[01:09:42.143 --> 01:09:51.828]  Well, I sure hope not, but at this point I'm not sure how we can stop them, except I have
[01:09:52.418 --> 01:09:58.380]  Great hopes that the people in the military can put a stop to it.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.421]  Got a little story for you.
[01:10:00.421 --> 01:10:13.807]  At least twice in our recent history, the military chain of command within the White House has essentially prevented World War III.
[01:10:13.807 --> 01:10:17.548]  They took the button out of the hands of the President.
[01:10:17.548 --> 01:10:21.890]  One time was under Richard Nixon when he was
[01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:29.213]  Under threat of impeachment, and he was very unstable at that point.
[01:10:29.213 --> 01:10:46.202]  And the people within the White House, I know because they're friends of mine, the people who had the football and could initiate nuclear war, talked to each other and said, what are we going to do, you know, if he says nuke the Russians?
[01:10:46.202 --> 01:10:47.923]  And this happened again under Reagan.
[01:10:49.798 --> 01:10:56.124]  They made up the, they decided that, you know, first there'd be the question, why sir?
[01:10:56.124 --> 01:11:00.248]  And unless there was a damn good answer, nothing was going to happen.
[01:11:00.248 --> 01:11:10.538]  Because they took the same oath I did to defend the Constitution of the United States and protect it against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:11:10.538 --> 01:11:13.261]  That's right, you follow that, you don't follow the Fuhrer.
[01:11:13.968 --> 01:11:14.928]  That's right.
[01:11:14.928 --> 01:11:34.211]  So I am hopeful that there will be enough people in the Pentagon and generals willing to be fired like General Shinseki was, who dared tell the truth about what it would take to pacify Iraq.
[01:11:34.211 --> 01:11:43.333]  Willing to be fired to say the truth and not do something which is illegal, immoral, unconstitutional,
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.883]  Against the Nuremberg Principles and a war crime.
[01:11:46.883 --> 01:11:49.826]  Well, let me raise that point that you just brought up.
[01:11:49.826 --> 01:11:57.312]  Even Secretary White, who was a crook involved with Enron and the fake trading and the rest of it, they appointed their own crony as Secretary of the Army.
[01:11:57.312 --> 01:12:01.536]  He said, look, all my generals say 400,000 troops and will still probably fail.
[01:12:01.536 --> 01:12:04.619]  And they said, I want your resignation tomorrow.
[01:12:04.619 --> 01:12:07.522]  It's the same thing with the Shinseki and others canning him.
[01:12:07.522 --> 01:12:08.623]  I mean, even people that are
[01:12:13.394 --> 01:12:37.264]  Well, I'm just hoping that there are enough people in the military, and I know a lot of them, and I have great respect for them, that are willing to get themselves fired before getting this country into another quagmire, another war of aggression.
[01:12:39.338 --> 01:12:44.281]  God help us and God grant us regime change in Washington, D.C.
[01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:55.808]  Did your sources back during Nixon and Reagan say that, I mean, certainly Nixon has come out with planning to bomb his own convention to blame it on his political enemies.
[01:12:55.808 --> 01:12:57.469]  That's admitted.
[01:12:57.469 --> 01:13:03.793]  And I know that he was in some danger of starting a war in the Middle East just to get himself extricated from all of this.
[01:13:03.793 --> 01:13:08.136]  Are you saying that from your sources when you were, you know, later the head of
[01:13:09.275 --> 01:13:13.878]  Well, I guess the Space Command and the whole, uh, Star Wars secret project at the time.
[01:13:13.878 --> 01:13:25.547]  You're saying you've been told by high-level sources that, I mean, was there a concern he'd do it because he was on all those meds going crazy, talking to himself, or was there some type of inkling that he might attack somebody to get out of hot water?
[01:13:25.547 --> 01:13:28.889]  Uh, a little of both.
[01:13:28.889 --> 01:13:29.890]  Well, see, that's what I'm afraid of.
[01:13:29.890 --> 01:13:32.652]  I don't, I think the neocons have decided they're gonna do whatever it takes.
[01:13:33.448 --> 01:13:40.172]  Well, I'm pleading with our military chain of command to defend the Constitution of the United States and our people and their own troops by disobeying any
[01:14:03.488 --> 01:14:14.920]  Order which is illegal and God knows the order to do an aggressive war is an illegal order.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:21.046]  Well, Dr. Bellman, it's almost like we're in Nazi Germany and we're having to hope the high command does something.
[01:14:21.046 --> 01:14:23.008]  I mean, we've gotten into a situation.
[01:14:23.008 --> 01:14:25.491]  And 9-11 was our Reichstag fire.
[01:14:28.906 --> 01:14:38.033]  So, I mean, we're here in this Twilight Zone-type atmosphere where we're having to beg people to not do it.
[01:14:38.033 --> 01:14:49.442]  Let me bring up Star Wars, because I was reading some accounts about when you were the head of the Star Wars program, you even had the top brass say, look, when you leave here, go warn everybody and stop this.
[01:14:49.442 --> 01:14:50.763]  Tell us that story.
[01:14:50.763 --> 01:14:56.647]  Of course, nothing classified, but whatever you can tell us that you've already said before, and then anything new you can tell us.
[01:15:00.547 --> 01:15:04.008]  When I retired, I felt good about what we had done.
[01:15:04.008 --> 01:15:21.334]  The Star Wars program was a quiet, super-secret research program to understand the technology and develop countermeasures and know what the Russians might be able to do and to develop the bits and pieces, just in case the answer changed.
[01:15:21.334 --> 01:15:28.477]  But the answer we got from our strategic studies was, forget the technology.
[01:15:29.435 --> 01:15:44.584]  Uh, if you were successful technically in building this thing, it would be against our national security interests because it's useless in the hands of an innocent party sitting back trying to protect himself because it's so vulnerable.
[01:15:44.584 --> 01:15:47.345]  It's only useful in the hands of an aggressor.
[01:15:47.345 --> 01:15:49.086]  It's only good in snake attacks.
[01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:50.147]  Yeah.
[01:15:50.147 --> 01:15:55.030]  And so, uh, I reported that to our government in 1977 and
[01:15:58.244 --> 01:16:13.321]  Uh, what happened was that after I retired at 78, all of a sudden Reagan gets elected and with him pulling his strings are the people that we in the military used to call the lunatic fringe.
[01:16:13.321 --> 01:16:17.986]  Crazy George Keegan, General Danny Graham, Edward Teller.
[01:16:19.123 --> 01:16:30.270]  And these folks got him to do Star Wars, and I think convinced him that he invented the idea, which he, of course, claimed in his March 23rd, 1983 speech.
[01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:39.815]  Well, yeah, 1979 at Bohemian Grove, Time Magazine reported they came to him and said, we've already got this program, call it Star Wars.
[01:16:39.815 --> 01:16:45.218]  Well, I called it Star Wars in 1977 in my secret report to the government.
[01:16:45.218 --> 01:16:46.399]  So you're the guy that coined it?
[01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:59.176]  But it was independently coined, I'm sure, later by critics after Reagan's speech, because he didn't call it Star Wars.
[01:16:59.176 --> 01:17:07.881]  But the fact of the matter is that after his Star Wars speech, I continued to speak out.
[01:17:07.881 --> 01:17:13.785]  I was speaking out very cautiously in 81 and 82 about the dangers of weapons in space.
[01:17:14.822 --> 01:17:23.786]  After Star Wars 3, I really got busy and Reagan's own Joint Chiefs of Staff called me in and said, we can't say anything.
[01:17:23.786 --> 01:17:30.868]  There's a gag order on everybody on active duty and even anybody who retired after Reagan took office.
[01:17:30.868 --> 01:17:31.849]  We can't say a thing.
[01:17:31.849 --> 01:17:32.869]  We can't write anything.
[01:17:33.502 --> 01:17:35.043]  You retired in time.
[01:17:35.043 --> 01:17:38.386]  You've got to warn the American people about this military lunacy.
[01:17:38.386 --> 01:17:39.267]  So I did.
[01:17:39.267 --> 01:17:46.854]  Now they were worried because, and correct me if I'm wrong, Doctor, because this would just cause a weapons race in space, something that hadn't been weaponized yet.
[01:17:46.854 --> 01:17:55.341]  And as you said, it would allow the Russians then to have a sneak attack capability and it was only good for us in a sneak attack offensive capability.
[01:17:55.341 --> 01:17:55.861]  That's right.
[01:17:55.861 --> 01:17:56.222]  And of course,
[01:17:57.943 --> 01:18:06.905]  We always believed, we in the military believed, that we were the good guys, that we weren't going to start a nuclear war, that we wouldn't be the aggressors.
[01:18:06.905 --> 01:18:10.506]  And so, these weapons were useless to us.
[01:18:10.506 --> 01:18:13.547]  They were only valuable to an aggressor.
[01:18:13.547 --> 01:18:21.468]  And we know that the people that were pulling Reagan's strings, that's exactly what they wanted.
[01:18:21.468 --> 01:18:22.989]  They wanted to be the aggressor.
[01:18:22.989 --> 01:18:24.789]  They wanted to start a nuclear war.
[01:18:26.176 --> 01:18:26.877]  I think so.
[01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:43.712]  Uh, anyway, I did speak out.
[01:18:43.712 --> 01:18:49.519]  I gave over 5,000 speeches around the country about Reagan's Star Wars scheme.
[01:18:49.519 --> 01:19:00.531]  And that really got me, of course, it got me out of industry, it got me out of, you know, the mainstream, and I became a
[01:19:01.425 --> 01:19:04.106]  I'm a permanent whistleblower and troublemaker.
[01:19:04.106 --> 01:19:05.727]  And that's what I still am.
[01:19:05.727 --> 01:19:06.908]  How far can you go?
[01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:11.990]  And if I can, I want to hold you for five more minutes, sir, to the other side, because we've got Bob Daisy coming up, because I want to be able to answer this question.
[01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:17.793]  But when we get back, I want to know just how much you can tell us about what we know is up there right now.
[01:19:17.793 --> 01:19:20.154]  X-ray lasers?
[01:19:20.154 --> 01:19:21.195]  Hydrogen bombs?
[01:19:21.195 --> 01:19:22.955]  Or are they planning to put that in space?
[01:19:22.955 --> 01:19:26.377]  Or is it just missile killers or particle beams?
[01:19:26.377 --> 01:19:28.198]  You know, what have they put up there?
[01:19:28.198 --> 01:19:29.118]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:29.118 --> 01:19:30.139]  Final segment with
[01:19:31.255 --> 01:19:32.338]  Dr. Bob Bowman.
[01:19:32.338 --> 01:19:34.864]  We can link through to his website at m4wars.com.
[01:19:34.864 --> 01:19:35.265]  Stay with us.
[01:19:39.093 --> 01:19:50.000]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.844]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:57.844 --> 01:20:01.246]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:01.246 --> 01:20:06.930]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:13.776]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:17.719]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:20:17.719 --> 01:20:19.801]  The water level is always visible.
[01:20:19.801 --> 01:20:25.986]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:20:25.986 --> 01:20:29.709]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:21:39.375 --> 01:21:44.101]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:21:44.101 --> 01:21:47.845]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:21:47.845 --> 01:21:55.935]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:21:56.195 --> 01:22:02.140]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:07.664]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:22:07.664 --> 01:22:10.006]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[01:22:10.006 --> 01:22:22.155]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:22:22.375 --> 01:22:27.017]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:22:27.017 --> 01:22:28.157]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:29.898]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:22:29.898 --> 01:22:31.959]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:22:31.959 --> 01:22:32.439]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:22:32.439 --> 01:22:32.639]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:22:39.517 --> 01:22:41.639]  What causes foods to spoil?
[01:22:41.639 --> 01:22:44.941]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[01:22:44.941 --> 01:22:50.525]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[01:22:50.525 --> 01:23:00.011]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[01:23:00.331 --> 01:23:06.634]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says, Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:23:06.634 --> 01:23:10.155]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:23:10.155 --> 01:23:13.837]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says, You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:23:13.837 --> 01:23:17.459]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:18.859]  I'm really amazed.
[01:23:18.859 --> 01:23:24.842]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:23:24.842 --> 01:23:27.263]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:23:27.623 --> 01:23:32.684]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us.
[01:23:32.684 --> 01:23:35.905]  Or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:23:35.905 --> 01:23:43.286]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[01:23:43.286 --> 01:23:46.907]  They railed against the crown.
[01:23:46.907 --> 01:23:48.828]  They railed against the crown.
[01:23:48.828 --> 01:23:50.468]  Another ragtag band.
[01:23:50.468 --> 01:23:52.308]  Another ragtag band.
[01:23:52.308 --> 01:23:53.909]  Declaring independence.
[01:23:53.909 --> 01:23:54.489]  Declaring independence.
[01:23:56.499 --> 01:24:01.861]  They laid their lives, their liberty, their treasure down.
[01:24:01.861 --> 01:24:03.943]  In a bloody war.
[01:24:03.943 --> 01:24:06.204]  For liberty.
[01:24:06.204 --> 01:24:09.546]  For us.
[01:24:09.546 --> 01:24:12.607]  What are we doing for our descendants?
[01:24:12.607 --> 01:24:13.908]  Thanks to them, we're free today.
[01:24:13.908 --> 01:24:17.630]  You know, we play... We play a clip of that
[01:24:24.449 --> 01:24:26.430]  Almost every single broadcast.
[01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:38.034]  Because I want to thank our founding fathers, and I want to thank the veterans, and I want to thank the modern day heroes, like Dr. Bob Bowman, who are standing up and who are going to help us defeat these bastards.
[01:24:38.034 --> 01:24:39.414]  Dr. Bowman, do you have any doubt?
[01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:43.956]  I mean, I see so many prominent people, so many grassroots people, so many good people.
[01:24:43.956 --> 01:24:45.996]  You know, we've got the good thinkers.
[01:24:45.996 --> 01:24:48.017]  Normally, the smartest people are the good people.
[01:24:48.746 --> 01:24:49.967]  They are the informed people.
[01:24:49.967 --> 01:24:55.069]  And then you've got this dumbed-down mass and this gaggle of insane power-controlling freaks.
[01:24:55.069 --> 01:24:56.009]  And I think we can beat them.
[01:24:56.009 --> 01:24:57.890]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:58.670]  Absolutely.
[01:24:58.670 --> 01:25:00.651]  I'm very hopeful.
[01:25:00.651 --> 01:25:01.932]  There's so many of us now.
[01:25:01.932 --> 01:25:16.978]  And I tell people out there, if you've got a combat veteran running for office in your district, and he's against this Iraq war, and he's against NAFTA, GATT, CAFTA, World Trade Organization, all the globalization,
[01:25:18.997 --> 01:25:19.838]  Help him.
[01:25:19.838 --> 01:25:22.319]  Get him elected.
[01:25:22.319 --> 01:25:25.562]  My website is bowman2006.com.
[01:25:25.562 --> 01:25:27.263]  Help me.
[01:25:27.263 --> 01:25:29.424]  I've linked to the others.
[01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:40.932]  Help us all get in there and have a Citizens Congress that will serve the needs of the people for a change instead of the greeds of the corporations and the billionaires.
[01:25:40.932 --> 01:25:44.174]  Well, sir, you're a warrior in your own right.
[01:25:44.174 --> 01:25:47.897]  So many people say we can't win, we can't fight, but what fight in life
[01:25:48.633 --> 01:25:54.617]  Even if it's a bully picking on you when you're 10 years old, he's 15, he's trying to beat you up, it's always better just to fight back.
[01:25:54.617 --> 01:26:01.020]  I mean, I know that half the battle is knowing we can win and simply putting one foot in front of the other.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:02.441]  Absolutely.
[01:26:02.441 --> 01:26:04.042]  I mean, is that the lesson you've learned from life?
[01:26:04.042 --> 01:26:05.423]  What other lessons?
[01:26:05.423 --> 01:26:08.005]  Oh, you betcha.
[01:26:08.005 --> 01:26:12.207]  You know, people said I didn't have a chance of keeping weapons out of space in 1983.
[01:26:14.409 --> 01:26:16.511]  But, you know, we did it.
[01:26:16.511 --> 01:26:20.053]  I learned that one person can make a difference.
[01:26:20.053 --> 01:26:21.374]  You're making a difference.
[01:26:21.374 --> 01:26:22.935]  I'm making a difference.
[01:26:22.935 --> 01:26:25.377]  We can all make a difference.
[01:26:25.377 --> 01:26:28.379]  Well, we've also got the motivating factor of trying to keep this country free.
[01:26:28.379 --> 01:26:34.583]  I mean, you know, they changed the rule two years ago where they can start taking private pension funds, and now GM's talking about gutting it.
[01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:36.804]  I mean, we're in crisis mode here.
[01:26:36.804 --> 01:26:37.525]  We are indeed.
[01:26:38.765 --> 01:26:43.868]  Space-based weapons, you know, all those, what, 84% of the shuttle missions have been secret.
[01:26:43.868 --> 01:26:46.149]  There's all these other secret rockets going off.
[01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:47.270]  I mean, what do you think's up there?
[01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:48.290]  I mean, you say you stopped it.
[01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:53.573]  We know you stopped the public weaponization, and a lot of evidence shows that their programs were scaled way back.
[01:26:53.573 --> 01:26:57.075]  But, I mean, what did they want to put in space versus what they have put in space?
[01:26:58.524 --> 01:27:00.765]  Well, they wanted all sorts of stuff up there.
[01:27:00.765 --> 01:27:08.549]  The laser battle stations, the kinetic energy kill vehicles, all sorts of things.
[01:27:08.549 --> 01:27:11.951]  Now, we know that... That's the rail guns?
[01:27:11.951 --> 01:27:15.332]  No, that's another one still.
[01:27:15.332 --> 01:27:19.214]  But I've got a whole book on that stuff.
[01:27:19.214 --> 01:27:20.495]  Oh, tell us about it.
[01:27:20.495 --> 01:27:23.577]  Well, Star Wars Defense or Death Star.
[01:27:23.577 --> 01:27:27.579]  It's out of print now, but I do have a few of them.
[01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:35.493]  And if people are really interested in that, they can contact me through my website.
[01:27:35.493 --> 01:27:39.058]  And if they're interested in the history of this, this is a 1984 book.
[01:27:42.358 --> 01:28:08.935]  But it tells all the technology and the strategy and why these things were against our security interest and why if we had done what Reagan said he wanted to do, which is build Star Wars and give one to the Russians too so we'd both be protected, it would have meant instantaneous and automatic nuclear war.
[01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:12.427]  And the last minute we've got left, why?
[01:28:12.427 --> 01:28:15.890]  I mean, break that equation down.
[01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:37.428]  Well, these weapons, including the ones that Bush is working on now and wanting to put into space, are so vulnerable to even modest technology that any country that wanted to actually shoot an ICBM at us, and had the technology to do that,
[01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:59.647]  ...would automatically have the technology to shoot down Bush's 747s with lasers orbiting off the coast of China, for example, or destroy one of our cruisers with interceptors on it sitting off the coast of North Korea.
[01:28:59.647 --> 01:29:04.551]  The thing about all of these weapons, including the space weapons, is they have to get within
[01:29:06.022 --> 01:29:10.026]  Miles of the launch point to do any good, and they can be destroyed.
[01:29:10.026 --> 01:29:17.333]  So, it was all a hoax on the American people, this whole defense shield.
[01:29:17.333 --> 01:29:17.793]  Just like 9-11.
[01:29:17.793 --> 01:29:24.059]  Just like a 9-11, just like the Iraq War, and just like the coming Iran War if we don't put a stop to it.
[01:29:24.059 --> 01:29:25.621]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:26.361]  Thank you.
