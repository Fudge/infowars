[00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.264]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:07.985]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.786]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:11.247]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:12.888]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:17.250]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:24.013]  Music
[00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:36.250]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.232]  It is Wednesday, June 28, 2006.
[00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:43.536]  We'll be live here for the next two hours, 59 and a half minutes.
[00:00:45.537 --> 00:00:48.239]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:53.564]  You can talk about all the stage terror raids they've had from England, Canada to Florida.
[00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:57.807]  We can get into Russia, Limbaugh, caught with Viagra and other drugs.
[00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.049]  Notice how the media spins it, though.
[00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:02.911]  Oh, it's just Viagra and other drugs.
[00:01:05.948 --> 00:01:09.511]  And Drudge started putting that spin out minute one when the story came out.
[00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:10.472]  Oh, Viagra!
[00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:13.495]  And then you read into the article, and other drugs.
[00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:20.962]  The reason it's important is because it shows the hypocritical nature of these individuals.
[00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:26.988]  Also, blink 182 star, latest celebrity to question official 9-11 story.
[00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:42.707]  And if you're like me, you haven't heard of Blink-182, but Blink-182 has had two top of the charts albums, CDs, songs, MP3s just in the last few years alone.
[00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:45.668]  So they're a very popular pop slash punk group.
[00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:48.552]  And they're questioning the official story.
[00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:56.193]  Attack was not perpetrated by a bunch of people who just learned to fly planes, says Pop Icon on San Diego FM station.
[00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:57.274]  We're going to try to get them on.
[00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:10.637]  So what's the establishment going to do when we have a society totally obsessed with celebrity and then the celebrities, one by one, start exposing the official story?
[00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:12.858]  We'll get into this report by Paul Watson.
[00:02:12.918 --> 00:02:14.278]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:19.800]  Also, a damage study urged on surveillance reports.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:34.087]  Senator Pat Roberts, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked the director of national intelligence, that's Negroponte, on Tuesday to assess any damage to American counterterrorism efforts caused by the disclosure of secret programs to monitor telephone calls and financial transactions.
[00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:39.170]  And, of course, there's talk of arresting members of the New York Times who first reported on it.
[00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:44.313]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I want to sell you.
[00:02:45.117 --> 00:03:08.529]  It has been in mainstream news here and there, back of the paper, and in industry publications since 1996, that the National Security Agency has offices in every telecommunications hub in the Western world, including Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada.
[00:03:10.603 --> 00:03:18.328]  Now, remember, it came out three months ago that there are whole floors in AT&T and other institutions run by the NSA.
[00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:23.052]  Exactly what I said, exactly what I wrote, exactly what I footnoted.
[00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:26.454]  People said, how did Alex know they had, quote, whole floors?
[00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:29.656]  Because that was in the news a decade ago.
[00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:30.957]  That's how I knew.
[00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:33.879]  How did I know that I drank orange juice this morning?
[00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.620]  Because I drank it and it was orange juice.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.441]  How did I know the sun came up?
[00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:39.723]  How did I know that I'm breathing oxygen to survive?
[00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.473]  That's what I respirate off of.
[00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:45.374]  I mean, it's not hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:48.835]  We have absolutely no freedom of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:51.456]  It's been flushed down the commode a long time ago.
[00:03:51.516 --> 00:03:53.077]  They just don't want you to notice that.
[00:03:54.037 --> 00:04:05.482]  And so they want to set yet another precedent to let's arrest reporters if they report on the government breaking the law of felony every time they do it.
[00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:21.425]  Well, they announced they were going to do it back in 96 and paid to put in the hubs over the next few years, but still they operate as if they aren't doing it, and the courts operate as if they're not totally violating the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:32.931]  So every email, every fax, every phone call, every major radio transmission is intercepted, is decoded, is tracked, is filed on keyword.
[00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:39.785]  I mean, that's as big a fact as water's wet and ducks quack.
[00:04:44.707 --> 00:04:50.990]  I mean, that's as guaranteed as the smell of gasoline fumes at the MD-500.
[00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:55.732]  All right, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:57.692]  Plunge into all the news and take your calls.
[00:04:57.712 --> 00:04:59.393]  And, you know, we've got two guests coming up today for you.
[00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:08.111]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:09.791]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:12.192]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.352 --> 00:05:14.432]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:19.654]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.974 --> 00:05:24.015]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:26.056]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:36.782]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:38.804]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.024 --> 00:05:42.886]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:44.407]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:11.705]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:19.451]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:20.452]  We're good to go.
[00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.532]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:39.572 --> 00:06:41.494]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:41.654 --> 00:06:47.599]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.102]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:02.051]  Hello, friends.
[00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:03.833]  Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:06.114]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:13.318]  I mean, real hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:22.124]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple-concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:07:22.464 --> 00:07:27.149]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:31.333]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.976]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:38.501]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:41.904 --> 00:07:45.445]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.

[00:07:48.086 --> 00:07:49.447]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calvinpuresoap.com.
[00:07:49.467 --> 00:07:51.847]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:08:02.722 --> 00:08:08.747]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.347 --> 00:08:12.410]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.292 --> 00:08:23.879]  Well, some big rock and roll stars, very popular band, top of the charts, has gone public questioning the official 9-11 fable.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.503]  They're trying to go after reporters for exposing NSA spying on the American people.
[00:08:29.323 --> 00:08:31.245]  Just one more sign of massive police state.
[00:08:31.946 --> 00:08:37.371]  Adios, Ward Churchill, is the headline on the article Kurt Nemo wrote, 9-11 official version Guardian.
[00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:45.438]  Yeah, I don't like Ward Churchill, and we'll be going over that, but at the same time, I don't think it's good that he's been canned, been fired.
[00:08:45.498 --> 00:08:56.168]  Again, I believe in free speech, but at every level, it's being attacked, because if somebody else loses their job because of free speech, especially in a sanctum like academia, none of us are safe.
[00:08:56.906 --> 00:08:58.447]  We'll be getting into all that and a lot more.
[00:08:58.567 --> 00:09:01.289]  Iran wants to purchase more nuclear reactors from Russia.
[00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:20.501]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I didn't spend enough time on it with all the guests we had on.
[00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:21.562]  I will spend more time today.
[00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:23.103]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:26.606]  Bush ignores laws he inked and vexes Congress.
[00:09:26.746 --> 00:09:28.707]  That's right, he signs laws and then doesn't follow them.
[00:09:30.068 --> 00:09:34.291]  And we'll talk more about why Transportation Secretary Chief Norman Mineta has resigned.
[00:09:34.992 --> 00:09:41.937]  At the same time, I mentioned this, but now we've seen more of the spin a day and a half into this story, so now I can comment on it more.
[00:09:42.437 --> 00:09:44.379]  And it went exactly as we thought it would.
[00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:45.980]  Limbaugh detained at airport.
[00:09:46.932 --> 00:09:53.040]  That was the headline, but by the time the national neocon media had spun it, it was Limbaugh detained for Viagra.
[00:09:53.861 --> 00:10:00.089]  Actually what he was found with was the possession of illegal prescription drugs, Viagra and others.
[00:10:01.044 --> 00:10:02.465]  Viagra and others.
[00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:11.330]  Because a lot of people say, well, Limbaugh's joking around saying, yeah, Bob Dole, I guess, is going to get in trouble, and he's mentioning that other people are.
[00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:20.415]  Limbaugh, the point is, in this police state that you defend, any of us would go to jail for having Viagra out of the bottle, or any other prescription drug.
[00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:26.778]  In fact, young people go to jail when their mothers send Tylenol or Advil with them.
[00:10:27.178 --> 00:10:28.278]  That's been all over the news.
[00:10:28.318 --> 00:10:35.020]  Just type into Google, teen arrested for Tylenol or teen arrested for over-the-counter pills.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.900]  Oh, we have a zero tolerance in America now.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.741]  We've got to keep you all safe.
[00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:46.102]  But Limbaugh, we can probably guess what those other illegal drugs were, buddy, and you are on probation.
[00:10:47.722 --> 00:10:51.146]  Pleading guilty for your doctor shopping and all those goodies?
[00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:54.450]  I don't think you should get in any trouble, Limbaugh.
[00:10:55.431 --> 00:11:00.697]  But at the same time, you're a hypocrite, and so we do need to address it.
[00:11:00.777 --> 00:11:03.080]  So we'll get more into that coming up.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.902]  The phone number to join us, toll free, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:11:08.592 --> 00:11:08.652]  1-800-259-9231
[00:11:38.592 --> 00:11:39.312]  Is it getting better?
[00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:13.726]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:16.987]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[00:12:19.348 --> 00:12:32.632]  You've got someone to blame You said one love, one life When it's one need in the night
[00:12:34.472 --> 00:12:46.680]  One love we get to share it It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it Did I disappoint you?
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:54.524]  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
[00:13:05.177 --> 00:13:33.459]  You act like you never had love And you want me to go without Well, it's too late, too late To drag the past out into the light We're one, but we're not the same We get to carry each other, carry each other
[00:13:46.202 --> 00:13:48.224]  Have you come here for forgiveness?
[00:13:51.126 --> 00:13:53.308]  Have you come to raise the dead?
[00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.671]  Have you come here to play Jesus?
[00:14:01.213 --> 00:14:03.475]  To the lepers in your head?
[00:14:05.101 --> 00:14:07.162]  Did I ask too much?
[00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:09.805]  More than a lot?
[00:14:11.146 --> 00:14:13.008]  You gave me nothing now.
[00:14:13.808 --> 00:14:14.949]  It's all I got.
[00:14:16.551 --> 00:14:19.373]  We're one, but we're not the same.
[00:14:20.514 --> 00:14:24.498]  Well, we hurt each other, and we're doing it again.
[00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:53.216]  You say love is a temple Love the higher law Love is a temple Love the higher law You ask me to enter But then you make me crawl And I can't be holding on To what you've got When all you've got is hurt One love One love
[00:14:55.101 --> 00:15:19.996]  One life you've got to do what you should One life with each other, sisters and brothers One life, but we're not the same We get to carry each other, carry each other one
[00:15:25.227 --> 00:15:25.888]  One.
[00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:37.637]  One.
[00:15:38.358 --> 00:15:39.459]  One.
[00:15:42.842 --> 00:15:44.022]  You've got one life.
[00:15:44.063 --> 00:15:45.404]  You should do what you should.
[00:15:45.524 --> 00:15:46.885]  Do the right thing.
[00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:50.868]  And I can't say any better than Johnny Cash.
[00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:53.090]  Terror expert, London...
[00:15:54.136 --> 00:15:56.438]  Bomber was working for MI5.
[00:15:56.518 --> 00:15:58.819]  Another report out on this yesterday.
[00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:00.440]  I never even got to this on the stack.
[00:16:00.941 --> 00:16:06.084]  Khan uses informant for security services, so it's not just a SWAT now.
[00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:21.654]  A former terror expert has told the BBC that Mohammed Saeed Khan, the alleged ringleader of the 7-7 London bombings, was working for British intelligence agency MI5 as an informant at the same time of the attacks.
[00:16:21.674 --> 00:16:22.735]  Well, yeah, they're carrying him out.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:36.131]  Charles Shoebridge, we want to get him on, is a 12-year veteran detective with the London Metropolitan Police, a former graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, and now a broadcaster and writer on terrorism in the UK.
[00:16:37.092 --> 00:16:45.439]  Shoebridge told the BBC NewsHour program that, from the evidence, little else can be assumed other than Khan was working for British intelligence.
[00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:46.640]  Welcome to the club, buddy.
[00:16:47.515 --> 00:17:00.320]  The amount of information coming out, and the quality of information coming out, the fact that there has been so consistently overlooked, it would appear by the security services of MI5 to me to suggest really only one of two options.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:14.806]  Either A, we've got a level of incompetence that would be unusual even for the security services, or B, the possibility, and this is a possibility, that the man, Kahn, may have been working as an informant for the security services.
[00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:21.158]  It is difficult otherwise to see how it can be that they've so covered his tracks in the interim.
[00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:23.159]  Well, you've got to protect your bombers.
[00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:23.939]  I mean, come on.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.041]  You can click there and listen to the interview.
[00:17:27.101 --> 00:17:29.062]  In fact, I'm going to send this to the network.
[00:17:29.102 --> 00:17:29.662]  Go ahead and grab it.
[00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:30.402]  I'm going to play it.
[00:17:31.002 --> 00:17:36.085]  During our coverage of London bombings, we outlined how the attack...
[00:17:37.111 --> 00:17:46.374]  ...was most likely constructed using the patsies described as nice guys with families and good jobs in the capacity of role players testing security on the London Underground.
[00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:50.056]  Just as the supposed hijackers thought that's what they were doing.
[00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:50.796]  They were government agents.
[00:17:50.816 --> 00:17:51.436]  We know that, too.
[00:17:51.856 --> 00:17:53.677]  They always are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:54.770 --> 00:18:13.989]  This message meshes with the inconceivable coincidence of exercises which drilled the same targets being attacked at the same time being conducted by advisor consultants and eyewitness reports suggesting the accused displayed no behavior conducive with suicide bombings.
[00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:27.507]  The alleged bombers bought return train tickets, left pay and display tickets on their cars in Luton, and their movements captured on CCTV gave no indications that they were nervous about their imminent deaths.
[00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:36.455]  Even Metropolitan Police investigators now believe that the bombers were dupes set up by someone else and don't know that they were carrying the explosives.
[00:18:36.656 --> 00:18:37.076]  Didn't know.
[00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:41.950]  7-7 links with British intelligence agencies don't end with Khan.
[00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:54.138]  The terror expert John Lopez told Fox News' Dayside Show the alleged bombing mastermind Haroon Rashida Swat was an MI6 asset and that the British security helped protect and hide before the bombings.
[00:18:54.678 --> 00:19:03.124]  Recent media concerning Khan's movements have brought to light the evidence that Khan's Honda Accord was bugged by MI5 prior to the bombings,
[00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:04.953]  Very, very interesting.
[00:19:32.561 --> 00:19:40.706]  Alright, when we get back, we'll get into Blink 182's star as the latest celebrity to question 9-11.
[00:19:41.807 --> 00:19:46.830]  Limbaugh with a cocktail of drugs in his bag.
[00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.712]  Media spinning that it was only Viagra.
[00:19:51.633 --> 00:19:55.276]  We'll get more into the NSA surveillance and the move to arrest reporters.
[00:19:56.497 --> 00:20:00.199]  We'll talk about Ward Churchill and a lot more on the other side.
[00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:07.549]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:20:07.949 --> 00:20:10.631]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:15.394]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:20:15.554 --> 00:20:20.378]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:20:20.558 --> 00:20:25.301]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:20:25.521 --> 00:20:28.203]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:28.423 --> 00:20:31.305]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:33.606]  Looking for profit?
[00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.067]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:20:35.407 --> 00:20:38.269]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:20:38.649 --> 00:20:45.913]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:20:46.293 --> 00:20:49.775]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:21:02.256 --> 00:21:07.580]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.963]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[00:21:12.744 --> 00:21:14.205]  It includes a history of U.S.
[00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:18.388]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards.
[00:21:19.008 --> 00:21:20.649]  Learn the stability of real money.
[00:21:21.089 --> 00:21:23.131]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:25.072]  They are instruments of death.
[00:21:25.332 --> 00:21:27.354]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[00:21:27.924 --> 00:21:31.985]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.
[00:21:32.005 --> 00:21:33.145]  Call Midas today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:33.185 --> 00:21:33.445]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:33.465 --> 00:21:34.945]  Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.
[00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:36.146]  Get the 2006 Red Book.
[00:21:36.166 --> 00:21:37.146]  Help steer your own financial shift.

[00:21:53.922 --> 00:21:54.662]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.203 --> 00:22:04.070]  The war on terrorism.
[00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.172]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:22:07.453 --> 00:22:11.596]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:22:12.016 --> 00:22:12.857]  So what do you do?
[00:22:13.177 --> 00:22:17.741]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:22:18.223 --> 00:22:20.344]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:35.528]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:35.568 --> 00:22:42.630]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.993]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:48.214]  Globalists are concerned with

[00:24:02.394 --> 00:24:07.539]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.219 --> 00:24:10.562]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:18.589]  Blink-182 star, latest celebrity to question 9-11.
[00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:27.957]  Attack was not perpetrated by a bunch of people who just learned to fly planes, says pop icon on San Diego FM station.
[00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:30.930]  I want to get him on.
[00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.311]  How do you pronounce it, Scott?
[00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:33.031]  Is it DeLong?
[00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:50.224]  Blink-182 or 182 star Tom DeLong was followed in the footsteps of Charlie Sheen by becoming the latest celebrity to publicly doubt the official version of events behind 9-1-1 and voice his belief that the attacks were an inside job.
[00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:58.259]  Along is the lead singer of Blink-182, a Southern California punk pop quartet that has had two U.S.
[00:24:58.299 --> 00:25:08.773]  Billboard number one selling albums, and whose 1999 album of the state went platinum five times over.
[00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:20.631]  During a hosting spot on San Diego's KAV AFM radio station, DeLong talked to Professor James Fetzer about evidence of 911 inside involvement.
[00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:23.174]  I guess Fetzer stayed out in California or something.
[00:25:24.069 --> 00:25:24.830]  After the conference.
[00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:30.013]  We do know that the buildings came down in a fashion extremely similar to a controlled demolition of a building.
[00:25:30.053 --> 00:25:40.780]  We do know that the expertise that is needed to fly those gigantic planes into the exact location could never have been achieved by someone who just learned how to fly a small plane, DeLong said.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.363]  Well, yes, DeLong, that's using common sense, but you need to buy into the official hoax.
[00:25:46.223 --> 00:25:50.386]  Discussing the failure of NORAD to enact standard operating procedure and intercept the planes...
[00:25:51.511 --> 00:26:01.880]  And Norman Mineta's testimony about Cheney's order still standing, DeLong stated, Cheney knew the planes were coming in, and he kept the order to leave it alone so it could hit.
[00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:03.702]  Wow, that's great.
[00:26:04.803 --> 00:26:08.066]  It's so weird how our own government did it to us.
[00:26:08.086 --> 00:26:13.331]  9-1-1 was not perpetrated by a bunch of people that just learned how to fly planes, DeLong said.
[00:26:13.811 --> 00:26:16.754]  We need like a clapping track or something.
[00:26:17.435 --> 00:26:19.617]  In the computer, like other radio shows.
[00:26:19.657 --> 00:26:21.598]  In fact, go find one online.
[00:26:21.618 --> 00:26:22.779]  I've been talking about that forever.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.000]  Find an applause.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.221]  I mean, here, here, here.
[00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:29.323]  I'll just clap right here.
[00:26:29.403 --> 00:26:30.404]  Let's all clap together.
[00:26:30.804 --> 00:26:32.045]  Good job, DeLong.
[00:26:32.225 --> 00:26:32.845]  Good job.
[00:26:34.166 --> 00:26:35.687]  Yay!
[00:26:36.268 --> 00:26:36.908]  Yay!
[00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:39.110]  Now that is professional, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:40.351 --> 00:26:41.191]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:26:41.231 --> 00:26:42.252]  I got up early this morning.
[00:26:42.412 --> 00:26:43.753]  The coffee had run out of my house.
[00:26:45.265 --> 00:26:49.547]  I got here 10 minutes before showtime, drank a small cup, and I am not doing too well right now.
[00:26:49.567 --> 00:26:51.288]  It takes 45 minutes for coffee to hit.
[00:26:52.788 --> 00:27:02.973]  So I was stumbling over reading that article earlier, worse than ever, and this one, I can't... Yes, I'm an addict, but I don't think I should be arrested like Rush Limbaugh has been for using drugs.
[00:27:02.993 --> 00:27:06.755]  I don't use illegal drugs, but I think legal drugs are just as bad.
[00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:08.215]  I'm trying to get off coffee.
[00:27:08.235 --> 00:27:11.657]  I'm trying to get down to one cup in the morning instead of five cups over the day.
[00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:15.496]  And, boy, side issue.
[00:27:15.536 --> 00:27:15.896]  I don't know.
[00:27:16.617 --> 00:27:17.517]  You probably can't notice.
[00:27:17.597 --> 00:27:21.399]  I feel a little different or sound a little different, but I can certainly feel it being here on air.
[00:27:21.419 --> 00:27:25.561]  I just always have that ritual of coffee a few hours before I get on air, and not today.
[00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:29.122]  There's a big note hanging on my wife's computer.
[00:27:29.222 --> 00:27:31.263]  Please get me lots of coffee.
[00:27:33.504 --> 00:27:37.906]  Oh, yeah, when she gets me the coffee, when she gets me the coffee, this is what you'll hear.
[00:27:40.181 --> 00:27:48.565]  Here, let's give a round of applause to the lead singer Tom DeLonge of Blink-182.
[00:27:48.585 --> 00:27:49.586]  Go ahead.
[00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.450]  That's good.
[00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.511]  I think that's a loop of about a two-second clap.
[00:28:01.011 --> 00:28:04.633]  Okay, I'm not trying to be a comedian, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:04.753 --> 00:28:06.094]  I'm not trying to be a comedian here.
[00:28:06.821 --> 00:28:11.143]  I have to admit, this last weekend exhausted me to a huge, unprecedented level.
[00:28:12.284 --> 00:28:19.467]  I have literally been stumbling around for the past two days, giving speech after speech and running that whole thing.
[00:28:19.487 --> 00:28:20.507]  It was great fun.
[00:28:21.688 --> 00:28:24.109]  And we tried to get the biggest venue we could.
[00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:28.671]  It was the second biggest venue in a hotel in Los Angeles.
[00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:32.496]  It went pretty well.
[00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:33.036]  I liked it.
[00:28:33.116 --> 00:28:35.617]  I wish that we hadn't had to sardine everybody in.
[00:28:35.637 --> 00:28:38.338]  If I have another event, we're going to limit it.
[00:28:38.398 --> 00:28:42.759]  We're going to make sure that it's limited so that there's more room in the thing.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.661]  I guess that's always kind of a good problem to have.
[00:28:47.441 --> 00:28:51.002]  I'm now digressing off into flashbacks from the conference.
[00:28:52.442 --> 00:28:58.204]  It's weird to be so passionate and spend so much time in a place so intensely and then probably knowing I'll never be there again.
[00:28:59.445 --> 00:29:00.705]  Kind of like Ottawa, Canada.
[00:29:01.758 --> 00:29:04.340]  Well, I tell you, that was another interesting trip.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.243]  All right, now I'm really digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:08.743 --> 00:29:18.710]  We're going to break, and we're going to come back and go to Ruth, Jason, Luis, Nathaniel, and Gideon, and others.
[00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.052]  Pardon me?
[00:29:21.072 --> 00:29:21.412]  Gideon.
[00:29:21.992 --> 00:29:26.495]  And others that are patiently holding 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:27.296 --> 00:29:31.319]  William Rodriguez, who, getting a chance to see him speak in person, this guy's incredible.
[00:29:32.401 --> 00:29:33.521]  What a stage presence.
[00:29:33.561 --> 00:29:34.462]  What a hero of 9-11.
[00:29:34.762 --> 00:29:35.462]  He'll be joining us.
[00:29:35.862 --> 00:29:38.822]  Give us a quick update on what he thought of the conference and some new 9-11 info.
[00:29:39.423 --> 00:29:41.303]  We've got another update on what happened to people that were inside.
[00:29:41.323 --> 00:29:43.163]  We're trying to cover the Bilderberg Group in Canada.
[00:29:43.664 --> 00:29:45.184]  I've got a bunch of news from around the world.
[00:29:45.264 --> 00:29:47.284]  Your calls, though, on the other side.
[00:29:48.145 --> 00:29:49.665]  I've now released Terror Storm.
[00:29:49.685 --> 00:29:50.845]  The video is available.
[00:29:51.585 --> 00:29:52.506]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.966 --> 00:29:54.566]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.486 --> 00:29:58.167]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:02.739]  We're good to go.
[00:30:21.315 --> 00:30:24.397]  At WeCanTogether.com, our approach is different.

[00:31:07.144 --> 00:31:12.589]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:16.914]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.

[00:33:10.296 --> 00:33:12.857]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:13.717 --> 00:33:17.459]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:17.499 --> 00:33:19.680]  Your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:28.765]  You know, I really was going to wait a month to put out Terror Storm and the big official DVD with the extras.
[00:33:29.713 --> 00:33:31.413]  I've decided what the extras are going to be, too.
[00:33:31.473 --> 00:33:33.034]  It's just going to be some clips from the conference.
[00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:35.614]  But we can't wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:35.674 --> 00:33:43.696]  So right now, I have a little over 400 copies of Terror Storm that I made just for the conference that we have left.
[00:33:44.876 --> 00:33:46.337]  And it is really a special edition.
[00:33:46.377 --> 00:33:49.678]  It's got about four minutes in it that won't be in the final edition.
[00:33:50.418 --> 00:33:51.558]  It will come out in about a month.
[00:33:53.124 --> 00:33:53.884]  And we can't wait.
[00:33:53.904 --> 00:33:56.505]  We need to get this DVD out to people right now.
[00:33:56.625 --> 00:34:00.545]  So you can watch Terror Storm at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:02.406]  Now up there in three different formats.
[00:34:02.426 --> 00:34:06.286]  The fourth format is about to go up there for prisonplanet.tv members.
[00:34:06.306 --> 00:34:09.647]  When you're a prisonplanet.tv member, you get all 15 of my films.
[00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:11.067]  That's right, the newest Terror Storm.
[00:34:11.527 --> 00:34:20.129]  My weekly TV reports, my special reports from Bilderberg Group to England to Crawford, Texas to when I'm sitting in studio at KLBJ.
[00:34:21.724 --> 00:34:28.397]  And we shoot video of it, the in-studio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other documentaries like Loose Change 2.
[00:34:28.497 --> 00:34:29.819]  We've been authorized to post.
[00:34:31.723 --> 00:34:34.368]  It really is a ridiculously good deal.
[00:34:35.663 --> 00:34:36.163]  We're good to go.
[00:34:36.183 --> 00:34:36.484]  I think?
[00:35:05.504 --> 00:35:17.051]  The cost of three cups of coffee, $5.95 for a month, and you literally get all of those pieces of media, over 1,000 pieces of media, now up two years and, what, four months.
[00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:21.793]  That's how long prisonplanet.tv has been in operation.
[00:35:21.813 --> 00:35:27.477]  We're going to get a yearly membership and get three months absolutely free when you get a yearly membership.
[00:35:27.517 --> 00:35:30.919]  And then there's another good dividend in becoming a member.
[00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:32.900]  You also support what we're doing, so...
[00:35:33.844 --> 00:35:36.105]  It is so important to become a PrisonPlanta.tv member.
[00:35:36.305 --> 00:35:48.629]  And, yes, while supplies last, because we're only going to sell these 400 or so that we've got, and then you'll have to wait until the big official DVD comes out with the nice hard case and the color cover and the extras.
[00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:56.211]  But the Terror Storms we have right now have an opening menu that says 9-11 and the Neocon Agenda Symposium.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.941]  It has its own little special intro on it.
[00:35:59.301 --> 00:36:03.543]  So they are collector's items, and I'm signing each one of these that are going to go out.
[00:36:03.563 --> 00:36:04.524]  And when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:36:04.564 --> 00:36:05.564]  They could go in a week.
[00:36:05.604 --> 00:36:06.425]  They could go in a few days.
[00:36:06.805 --> 00:36:09.266]  I don't know how fast they'll go, but you really need to get them.
[00:36:09.286 --> 00:36:13.328]  So go to InfoWars.com and order them via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:36:13.748 --> 00:36:15.669]  Or call toll-free to get your copy of Terror Storm.
[00:36:15.689 --> 00:36:15.789]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:15.969 --> 00:36:16.630]  The 10-plus month.
[00:36:22.276 --> 00:36:23.717]  We actually heard him making this 11 months ago.
[00:36:23.737 --> 00:36:26.179]  Okay, the 11-month wait is over.
[00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:27.760]  Terror Storm is here.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.460]  What's the film about?
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.342]  We cover the overthrow of Mosaddegh.
[00:36:31.382 --> 00:36:35.084]  We cover more on Hitler and Gleiwitz and the attack on Poland, how they staged that.
[00:36:35.665 --> 00:36:37.986]  We get into the USS Liberty.
[00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:41.408]  Oh, yes, we touched that zeitgeist hot-button issue.
[00:36:42.229 --> 00:36:45.771]  We get into a whole host of important issues.
[00:36:46.131 --> 00:36:47.012]  The Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.823]  Northwoods, then we get into the London bombing, then we go to Crawford to show how the war was a fraud.
[00:36:53.843 --> 00:37:14.114]  We also have some clips from Chicago and the bullhorning there, and then interviews with Professor Stephen Jones, interviews with Morgan Reynolds, interviews with MI5 agents Andy Michon and David Shaler, interviews with Michael Meacher, former Blair Cabinet member, current Member of Parliament, Ray McGovern on 9-11.
[00:37:14.675 --> 00:37:16.095]  It is such an important film.
[00:37:16.115 --> 00:37:16.896]  Charlie Sheen,
[00:37:19.522 --> 00:37:21.422]  The film is Terror Storm.
[00:37:22.443 --> 00:37:24.183]  You need to have Terror Storm.
[00:37:24.923 --> 00:37:27.644]  It is my big wish that people see this.
[00:37:27.764 --> 00:37:30.364]  It's got higher production qualities than any other film ever made.
[00:37:30.705 --> 00:37:34.225]  Cost almost four times what my previous films have cost for me to make.
[00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:37.186]  Professional music, professional graphics, animations.
[00:37:38.086 --> 00:37:42.567]  It is powerful stuff and will be very effective in waking people up.
[00:37:42.587 --> 00:37:46.248]  My other videos, I don't want to say they start slow, but they're long and they build.
[00:37:47.205 --> 00:37:47.945]  Not Terror Storm.
[00:37:48.005 --> 00:37:49.886]  It just explodes out of the gates.
[00:37:50.526 --> 00:37:51.247]  Immediately.
[00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:55.328]  So be sure and get your copy of Terror Storm today.
[00:37:56.108 --> 00:38:01.810]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Maryland.
[00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:02.631]  Jason, go ahead.
[00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:05.632]  Hi, Jason.
[00:38:06.272 --> 00:38:06.552]  Hello?
[00:38:06.812 --> 00:38:07.092]  Hi.
[00:38:07.672 --> 00:38:14.255]  Yes, I called yesterday and spent a moment thanking you and Charlie Sheen and
[00:38:15.962 --> 00:38:20.004]  I'd really like to thank the one who deserves all the credit.
[00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:22.466]  If you could give me a moment to read just a couple of sentences.
[00:38:24.747 --> 00:38:29.969]  A roaring lion and a charging bear is a wrongdoing ruler over poor people.
[00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.771]  A leader who lacks understanding is a great oppressor.
[00:38:35.532 --> 00:38:42.275]  Evil men do not understand right ruling, but those who seek Yahweh understand all.
[00:38:43.236 --> 00:38:43.776]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:38:44.676 --> 00:38:45.036]  Thank you.
[00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.037]  I appreciate the call.
[00:38:46.718 --> 00:38:49.900]  Certainly, God deserves all the credit for all the work we're doing.
[00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:54.384]  And I ask God every day to lead God and direct me in my work.
[00:38:55.324 --> 00:38:56.826]  I know I'm not a perfect instrument.
[00:38:56.886 --> 00:38:57.466]  None of us are.
[00:38:57.506 --> 00:38:59.107]  But I try as hard as I can.
[00:39:00.328 --> 00:39:02.130]  Let's talk to Luis in California.
[00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:02.910]  Luis, welcome.
[00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:06.293]  Yeah, hello?
[00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:06.834]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:07.374 --> 00:39:08.075]  Yo, Alex, can you hear me?
[00:39:08.295 --> 00:39:08.575]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:09.352 --> 00:39:16.157]  Yeah, listen, last night I watched Terror Storm, and it was absolutely the most amazing DVD that I've seen in years.
[00:39:16.177 --> 00:39:21.141]  The best one I think you've made, and I'm super excited to make copies for everyone I know.
[00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:32.129]  Now I'm just obsessed to figure out how... I'm not very tech-savvy, so I'm trying to figure out how to, like, just get a lot of copies out there, because I think this one is so professional and just so well-made, you know what I mean?
[00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:35.651]  Like, the thing is, there's a lot of people I want to show it to.
[00:39:35.971 --> 00:39:36.492]  Skeptics...
[00:39:36.969 --> 00:39:51.218]  So, with this one, I figure it doesn't matter if you're a skeptic, you're going to like, it's irrefutable what you're presenting, and it's like, I watched it with a couple of friends last night, and we were all just discussing just how powerful it was, you know, so I want to say good job about that.
[00:39:52.839 --> 00:39:53.419]  Well, thank you.
[00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:54.500]  I really appreciate that.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.481]  What part of the film did you think was the most powerful?
[00:39:56.781 --> 00:39:57.501]  Oh, my God.
[00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.423]  From beginning to end, really.
[00:39:59.443 --> 00:40:04.986]  I mean, but I thought, one thing, though, is I thought that having Charlie Sheen, all those segments,
[00:40:05.529 --> 00:40:19.721]  With Charlie Sheen and then you on Showbiz Tonight or CNN or whatever, I thought that that was great because that's really, I'm thinking from the point of view of the skeptic who doesn't want to look into these things, they just can't ignore that kind of thing, you know what I mean?
[00:40:19.761 --> 00:40:22.623]  That kind of thing is like, come on, you know what I mean?
[00:40:22.703 --> 00:40:26.727]  And plus, I mean, Charlie Sheen, that's absolutely great, you know what I mean, to have him in it.
[00:40:27.608 --> 00:40:33.933]  And I'm just really, really excited because I've been, so many years I've been working toward trying to get people to wake up to this and
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:45.583]  And, you know, honestly, a lot of the videos that I have, the DVDs, I mean, with the exception of, like, In Plain Sight, a lot of the other ones, like, I won't even mention them because they were good and well-intentioned, but they just weren't kind of professional.
[00:40:45.603 --> 00:40:52.345]  People have been brainwashed and mind-controlled to the point that if it doesn't seem like it's Discovery Channel quality, you know what I mean?
[00:40:52.445 --> 00:40:58.726]  It's almost like part of the brain tunes it out or it's easy to be skeptical when it's more grassroots, low-budget production.
[00:40:58.746 --> 00:41:00.907]  But this one was awesome.
[00:41:01.247 --> 00:41:03.288]  I mean, I just was, like, astounded.
[00:41:03.308 --> 00:41:04.328]  I'm so excited to, like,
[00:41:04.676 --> 00:41:06.677]  Figure out how to make copies and give to people.
[00:41:06.837 --> 00:41:09.537]  Well, you did, Garrett, for those that don't have long attention spans.
[00:41:09.637 --> 00:41:11.118]  I mean, it moves really fast.
[00:41:11.618 --> 00:41:12.798]  And it's great.
[00:41:12.858 --> 00:41:23.021]  I mean, it's wonderful for educators, too, for teachers, you know, critical thinking and history, that kind of thing, because it's such an amazing history lesson, too.
[00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:24.562]  And it's concise.
[00:41:24.942 --> 00:41:28.963]  And, I mean, I think this is the one that is going to be pivotal.
[00:41:29.023 --> 00:41:33.244]  I mean, I think it's going to have as much impact as loose change, you know?
[00:41:34.278 --> 00:41:36.679]  Well, it will if you take action as listeners.
[00:41:36.719 --> 00:41:37.079]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:41:37.279 --> 00:41:38.059]  Good to hear from you.
[00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:38.999]  Did you go to the conference?
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.640]  I wanted to so bad.
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:42.420]  I'm in San Francisco.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.001]  I wanted to go, but financially I couldn't make it.
[00:41:45.161 --> 00:41:45.821]  I understand.
[00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:46.721]  I'm just wondering.
[00:41:47.921 --> 00:41:50.162]  My friend picked it up at the conference.
[00:41:50.322 --> 00:41:53.443]  He was in the area, and I asked him to pick it up for me, and he did.
[00:41:54.443 --> 00:41:57.183]  We watched it last night, and we were just, it was great.
[00:41:57.243 --> 00:41:59.064]  I mean, this is perfect.
[00:41:59.444 --> 00:42:01.284]  I just can't say enough about how amazing.
[00:42:01.324 --> 00:42:03.725]  I've seen all your videos many times, you know.
[00:42:04.116 --> 00:42:09.940]  And I like them, but sometimes it's hard to show it to people who are skeptical and try to find any excuse to, like, downplay it.
[00:42:10.381 --> 00:42:12.222]  Especially people who are educated.
[00:42:12.322 --> 00:42:21.148]  Ironically, the people with the most education, meaning, like, career-minded, you know, college graduate, whatever, they seem to have the hardest time, I find.
[00:42:21.188 --> 00:42:26.032]  A lot of people who are just kind of, you know, normal, regular folk, working class, or just kind of, you know...
[00:42:26.468 --> 00:42:27.869]  They seem to be more open-minded.
[00:42:27.889 --> 00:42:33.693]  They don't have as much of a... Well, a lot of people think they're members of the establishment, and they think that you're attacking them.
[00:42:33.793 --> 00:42:34.513]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:35.434 --> 00:42:38.475]  That's a psychology I've seen, at least in some places.
[00:42:38.536 --> 00:42:40.457]  I wouldn't say it's overriding with education.
[00:42:40.477 --> 00:42:44.699]  I actually find a lot of folks that are educated know the facts and are already awake and aware.
[00:42:44.779 --> 00:42:53.625]  But certainly there is that educated idiot type who thinks that they're basically members of the elite because they make $80,000 a year, and they think that you're attacking them.
[00:42:54.754 --> 00:42:58.056]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nathaniel in Louisiana.
[00:42:58.096 --> 00:42:59.857]  Thanks for holding your on the air, Nathaniel.
[00:43:00.317 --> 00:43:00.698]  Hi, Alex.
[00:43:01.098 --> 00:43:01.358]  Hi.
[00:43:01.878 --> 00:43:06.941]  I just wanted to talk about the National Guard being dispatched back to New Orleans again.
[00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:07.862]  That's right.
[00:43:07.882 --> 00:43:09.183]  We get conditioned more and more.
[00:43:09.223 --> 00:43:13.946]  Now they have the National Guard with the police going around gun confiscating as usual.
[00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:16.147]  Yeah, I actually live in New Orleans.
[00:43:16.607 --> 00:43:19.669]  And, you know, I don't know if you'd call it a theory, but...
[00:43:21.185 --> 00:43:26.749]  The thing that they sent them down here for was as a reaction to some teenagers having a shootout.
[00:43:26.789 --> 00:43:28.671]  They crashed into a light pole and died.
[00:43:29.957 --> 00:43:33.338]  Yeah, so some people have a shootout, we've got to have troops on the streets.
[00:43:33.779 --> 00:43:42.322]  Just as Bush has said, we must impose a commentatus, we must have metal detectors in shopping malls, what you go through at the airport will be daily life on the streets.
[00:43:42.462 --> 00:43:44.042]  That is the official plan.
[00:43:44.062 --> 00:43:50.965]  When you go to the airport and take your shoes off, and they put you in a scanner, and they search you, that's training you how to be a slave.
[00:43:51.665 --> 00:43:55.987]  Well, they just had such an extreme reaction to a non-emergency event.
[00:43:56.887 --> 00:43:56.987]  And...
[00:43:58.022 --> 00:44:02.004]  These guys have been given indefinite timetable to be down here.
[00:44:02.024 --> 00:44:07.065]  I think that they just want to have a detail of guardsmen in the city permanently.
[00:44:07.986 --> 00:44:11.967]  What they're doing is it's actually made the city more of a police state.
[00:44:12.767 --> 00:44:18.589]  The whole entire eastern half of the city is still badly damaged and mostly uninhabited.
[00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:24.631]  And it's allowed them to condense the remaining police force into the populated areas.
[00:44:25.432 --> 00:44:25.992]  And so, I mean...
[00:44:27.011 --> 00:44:29.934]  You drive down the streets and there's cops on every single corner.
[00:44:29.954 --> 00:44:31.135]  They're putting in curfews.
[00:44:31.455 --> 00:44:35.779]  The newspaper just keeps running all these articles about how this is good.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.043]  You listen to local radio and same thing.
[00:44:40.063 --> 00:44:41.544]  They're just telling you, oh, it's so great.
[00:44:41.624 --> 00:44:43.366]  It's the solution to everything.
[00:44:45.007 --> 00:44:45.247]  I don't know.
[00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:46.368]  It's just preposterous.
[00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:49.331]  Have you seen the trips yourself?
[00:44:50.591 --> 00:44:51.792]  I saw them when they came in.
[00:44:51.852 --> 00:44:55.855]  They came in in a big, big, huge... Convoy.
[00:44:56.095 --> 00:45:01.960]  Yeah, and they set up at the convention center, but they're mostly located on the eastern half of the city.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.983]  You really don't get to see them too much, but they do have shoot-to-kill orders.
[00:45:06.793 --> 00:45:08.255]  Yeah, that's on the record.
[00:45:08.295 --> 00:45:09.737]  Yeah, troops to kill Americans.
[00:45:09.777 --> 00:45:13.142]  Listen, it's been the government's hope and dream for decades.
[00:45:13.162 --> 00:45:15.645]  We have their own documents, PDD 25 and others.
[00:45:16.006 --> 00:45:17.968]  We've talked to emergency managers that have been briefed.
[00:45:18.329 --> 00:45:21.052]  Thomas Sanchez, Kingsville, Texas, told us about it on air.
[00:45:21.693 --> 00:45:22.193]  We're good to go.
[00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:49.821]  And so they're setting that precedent, and they've got to set that precedent.
[00:45:49.881 --> 00:45:56.805]  And it may only be in New Orleans now, but the national news can show it over and over again and equate it with safety.
[00:45:57.406 --> 00:46:03.249]  Well, the spooky thing is that really there's no local voices saying that this is not a good thing.
[00:46:03.289 --> 00:46:10.173]  Like I said, when you read the newspaper articles, they'll have little excerpts and snippets of talking to residents and
[00:46:10.663 --> 00:46:14.346]  You know, you don't ever hear anybody expressing any kind of concern about it.
[00:46:14.366 --> 00:46:15.847]  And that's all selectively done.
[00:46:15.887 --> 00:46:19.869]  I mean, we've done reports here where I have a friend who works at the airport in security.
[00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:27.254]  He watched News 8 Austin talk, I think he said to 44 people, all saying they were against the increase in security and it was a police state.
[00:46:27.615 --> 00:46:33.519]  Then they found one little old lady that liked the troops being there, this was like a few months ago, and they put her on the news.
[00:46:33.559 --> 00:46:38.102]  And he said when he saw her do that, he knew that would be on the news, and that's what was on the news.
[00:46:38.686 --> 00:46:47.332]  Yeah, and I mean, the other thing, too, is the city has a completely different plan of action in case of a storm this year.
[00:46:48.613 --> 00:46:51.956]  Now, there's going to be no shelters offered at all in the city.
[00:46:52.416 --> 00:46:57.360]  It will be mandatory evacuation, and they will use buses and trains.
[00:46:58.086 --> 00:47:02.449]  To take to all these different hurricane centers throughout the country.
[00:47:02.889 --> 00:47:06.111]  And so the next time they tell us get on buses and trains, well, we've all seen it before.
[00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:08.393]  It's safe to do that.
[00:47:08.933 --> 00:47:15.277]  They admit that the people will be tagged with wristbands for tracking purposes.
[00:47:15.698 --> 00:47:15.898]  Yeah.
[00:47:16.378 --> 00:47:17.919]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:23.543]  Let us not forget that we have ABC and NBC news clips.
[00:47:24.784 --> 00:47:25.984]  There's no point in airing it again.
[00:47:26.024 --> 00:47:26.805]  I've heard it too much.
[00:47:27.552 --> 00:47:33.216]  Where they admit that the troops went in there and confiscated guns, even in high and dry wealthy areas.
[00:47:33.696 --> 00:47:44.023]  It's bad anywhere, but it just shows that they didn't bring aid in, they didn't bring food in, they didn't even save the emergency manager's mother who sat there in water at a nursing home for five days and finally died.
[00:47:45.364 --> 00:47:48.025]  And the cops sat there and took orders and didn't save their family members.
[00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:49.066]  I mean, that is pathetic.
[00:47:50.106 --> 00:47:50.306]  Thank you.
[00:47:50.346 --> 00:47:50.767]  Thank you.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.581]  We have civil war in Iraq.
[00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:22.703]  They get to stay decades, build permanent bases, and now they've spent $400 billion.
[00:48:26.205 --> 00:48:27.145]  You see how that works?
[00:48:27.465 --> 00:48:28.866]  The drug war is a total failure.
[00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:31.167]  More drugs, more prisons, more crime.
[00:48:31.988 --> 00:48:33.669]  And the government calls it a success.
[00:48:33.729 --> 00:48:34.069]  It is.
[00:48:34.129 --> 00:48:35.009]  They bring the drugs in.
[00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:36.410]  You see?
[00:48:37.344 --> 00:48:38.865]  They spend more money on education.
[00:48:38.885 --> 00:48:39.945]  People get even stupider.
[00:48:40.005 --> 00:48:40.686]  More dumbed down.
[00:48:40.726 --> 00:48:41.486]  More uneducated.
[00:48:41.806 --> 00:48:42.686]  It's a great success.
[00:48:43.227 --> 00:48:45.848]  Everything the government wants to do, we have their own documents.
[00:48:45.908 --> 00:48:46.508]  They're doing.
[00:48:46.828 --> 00:48:47.509]  Dumb us down.
[00:48:47.629 --> 00:48:48.489]  Ship drugs in.
[00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:49.910]  Break down society.
[00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:50.890]  Create crises.
[00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.311]  Out of that, they then centralize control.
[00:48:53.631 --> 00:48:56.973]  The New World Order's motto is, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:48:57.033 --> 00:48:58.153]  Bush even slipped up once.
[00:48:58.193 --> 00:49:01.375]  It's at the end of my film, American Dictators, in a press conference.
[00:49:01.655 --> 00:49:03.816]  He says, we're bringing you order out of chaos.
[00:49:04.801 --> 00:49:07.703]  And he says, I mean, you know, things get bad and then we make it better.
[00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:10.445]  According to their plan.
[00:49:13.588 --> 00:49:14.408]  So don't forget.
[00:49:15.689 --> 00:49:16.650]  Don't ever forget.
[00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:20.293]  That we have all this video of them gun confiscating.
[00:49:21.914 --> 00:49:23.055]  In fact, I can't help it.
[00:49:24.296 --> 00:49:25.016]  Just find it.
[00:49:25.136 --> 00:49:28.879]  Find the ABC one with the gun confiscations police.
[00:49:31.038 --> 00:49:35.060]  Let's just cue it up to the part where they're grabbing the guns because it's too long to play the whole thing.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:39.202]  I think it's like 30, well, actually play the whole thing when we come back from break.
[00:49:41.043 --> 00:49:47.106]  Understand, if there's an emergency, you're not going to get food and water.
[00:49:48.867 --> 00:49:57.251]  You're going to have armed troops led by FBI teams, that's who led the regular Army and National Guard, coming to take your guns.
[00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:03.829]  Remember, this is the same mayor and the same governor and the same feds that ordered gun confiscation.
[00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.591]  A federal judge told them to stop.
[00:50:05.631 --> 00:50:06.391]  They didn't stop.
[00:50:06.672 --> 00:50:10.595]  Then they said they never made the announcement when the police chief and the mayor made it on TV.
[00:50:10.875 --> 00:50:11.956]  And it was in the New York Times.
[00:50:12.016 --> 00:50:13.037]  And now they're back at it.
[00:50:13.357 --> 00:50:16.579]  And they've been ordered by a federal judge to turn the guns back over to people they took them from.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.640]  They're not doing it.
[00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:19.662]  Imagine.
[00:50:19.682 --> 00:50:20.422]  You're high and dry.
[00:50:20.442 --> 00:50:20.863]  You're fine.
[00:50:20.883 --> 00:50:21.403]  You've got food.
[00:50:21.443 --> 00:50:22.084]  You're in your house.
[00:50:22.544 --> 00:50:24.886]  A week later, they show up and they say, Come out of your house.
[00:50:25.286 --> 00:50:26.307]  Get in the paddy wagon.
[00:50:27.486 --> 00:50:28.627]  And give us your guns.
[00:50:29.187 --> 00:50:33.589]  And they go in and they take your great-granddaddy's black powder shotgun that's worth $10,000.
[00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.971]  They take the .22 your grandfather gave you when you were nine.
[00:50:37.832 --> 00:50:39.693]  They take the bowie knife your father gave you.
[00:50:39.733 --> 00:50:41.314]  They take everything you've got.
[00:50:42.534 --> 00:50:44.736]  They take your HK-91 that you bought.
[00:50:45.276 --> 00:50:47.457]  They load it all in there laughing and snickering.
[00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:48.658]  A bunch of young punks.
[00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:52.220]  A bunch of gang member troops with tattoos all over them.
[00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.893]  And they drive off laughing at you and you're in the back of a paddy wagon.
[00:50:56.233 --> 00:50:57.434]  That's the new America.
[00:50:59.055 --> 00:50:59.756]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.218 --> 00:51:09.624]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:09.885 --> 00:51:14.649]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:20.494]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.714 --> 00:51:25.236]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.456 --> 00:51:32.618]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.638 --> 00:51:37.160]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.841]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.081 --> 00:51:46.783]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.023 --> 00:51:48.045]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:48.065 --> 00:51:48.285]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:21.047 --> 00:52:21.648]  We're good to go.

[00:53:56.339 --> 00:54:07.212]  Imagine what our founding fathers would think.
[00:54:08.095 --> 00:54:08.615]  Think about it.
[00:54:08.695 --> 00:54:11.276]  It's really happening in the United States.
[00:54:11.496 --> 00:54:20.239]  Every excuse they can get, anytime somebody shoots at a cop or shoots somebody, they'll shut down neighborhoods and make everybody come out with their guns and lay them down on the street.
[00:54:20.639 --> 00:54:22.240]  There's gun buyback programs.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.281]  They're brainwashing kids that guns are illegal.
[00:54:24.581 --> 00:54:27.202]  There's federally paid-for billboards up all over the country.
[00:54:27.222 --> 00:54:28.082]  They're all over Texas.
[00:54:28.622 --> 00:54:29.143]  We're good to go.
[00:54:48.579 --> 00:54:51.522]  Bush is double the size of the BATF.
[00:54:51.582 --> 00:54:58.510]  Bob Barr has told you on this show, he's on the NRA board, that Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton in actions, not in rhetoric.
[00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:08.780]  But it doesn't matter because it feels good to love George W. Here, here's the gun confiscation in New Orleans from ABC.
[00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:10.162]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:55:10.782 --> 00:55:16.043]  That includes New Orleans, where today authorities stepped up their efforts to empty the city.
[00:55:16.583 --> 00:55:20.344]  Bob Woodruff is there again tonight with an extraordinary human drama unfolding.
[00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:20.644]  Bob?
[00:55:20.665 --> 00:55:24.225]  That's true, Elizabeth, and good evening from New Orleans.
[00:55:24.245 --> 00:55:34.228]  Here the police and the National Guard find themselves in a very difficult position tonight to try to carry out an order to force people from the city without actually using force.
[00:55:38.914 --> 00:55:41.776]  Today in New Orleans, they got a lot tougher on the holdouts.
[00:55:43.958 --> 00:55:51.104]  Not only the flooded areas, but New Orleans' driest and wealthiest neighborhoods, too.
[00:55:51.644 --> 00:55:56.828]  The police and National Guard going street by street, house to house.
[00:55:57.589 --> 00:56:03.153]  We need to make sure, too, that whenever we knock on doors, people refuse to leave, need to make note, call it in.
[00:56:04.437 --> 00:56:08.318]  They say there are no orders to use force, just strong persuasion.
[00:56:08.478 --> 00:56:11.058]  Sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn.
[00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:14.699]  And instructions to disarm anyone inside.
[00:56:15.759 --> 00:56:17.560]  You say guns will be taken?
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.680]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.940]  We will take all weapons.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:27.442]  That happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed themselves to protect their mansions.
[00:56:27.502 --> 00:56:29.342]  Residents were handcuffed on the ground.
[00:56:29.802 --> 00:56:32.943]  In the end, police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes.
[00:56:33.473 --> 00:56:36.275]  They were a little bit threatened because our weapons were bigger than their weapons.
[00:56:38.016 --> 00:56:42.759]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.462]  This guard unit occupied a church, using it as a base camp.
[00:56:47.843 --> 00:56:51.425]  They had to leave a note because they could not get hold of the pastor to get permission.
[00:56:51.825 --> 00:56:52.866]  It is surreal.
[00:56:53.907 --> 00:56:56.969]  You just never expect to do this in your own country.
[00:56:57.859 --> 00:57:02.304]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American neighborhoods.
[00:57:02.625 --> 00:57:07.370]  Walking up and down these streets, you don't want to think about the stuff that you're going to have to do.
[00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:08.391]  Somebody pops around the corner.
[00:57:08.411 --> 00:57:10.133]  Let me shoot an American.
[00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:11.054]  Yeah.
[00:57:12.556 --> 00:57:14.098]  And you shoot an American.
[00:57:14.118 --> 00:57:14.198]  Yeah.
[00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:21.731]  Now, notice, again, they use any crisis they can as a pretext to promote and do this.
[00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:23.932]  And we always told you there was a big disaster.
[00:57:23.952 --> 00:57:24.892]  They come for your guns.
[00:57:25.372 --> 00:57:26.312]  They don't bring water.
[00:57:26.452 --> 00:57:27.392]  They don't bring food.
[00:57:27.553 --> 00:57:30.693]  They bring their guns to take your guns.
[00:57:31.033 --> 00:57:32.034]  Guaranteed.
[00:57:32.894 --> 00:57:39.975]  If you're in trouble, if you're stuck, you're not trusted, they're coming to kick down your door and to take your guns.
[00:57:40.336 --> 00:57:41.656]  Guaranteed.
[00:57:43.196 --> 00:57:45.957]  So when the criminal elements of the government release smallpox,
[00:57:46.647 --> 00:57:50.808]  Or bird flu, or nuke a city, or a dirty bomb, or whatever they do.
[00:57:51.148 --> 00:57:52.409]  And of course, they'll be behind it.
[00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:57.270]  They'll march the troops out, and the troops will say, Well, we did this in New Orleans.
[00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.371]  Well, we've got to do it.
[00:57:59.451 --> 00:58:02.872]  Somebody a few days ago shot at us, so the whole city's guilty now.
[00:58:03.872 --> 00:58:15.016]  And it turns out most of it was people shooting at looters, and cops would hear it over the next hill, panic, or it'd be police shooting wild dogs or alligators, and then the cops hear the shooting and freak out.
[00:58:16.095 --> 00:58:27.883]  Just like at the Capitol, a jackhammer's going off, so the cops all run around and shut down every school in the city and shut down roads and shut down the Capitol and run around pointing guns at congressmen saying, Turn off!
[00:58:28.083 --> 00:58:29.384]  Don't talk to those news cameras!
[00:58:29.645 --> 00:58:31.186]  Yes, sir, Capitol Police.
[00:58:31.466 --> 00:58:33.747]  I take orders from you and the executive.
[00:58:34.868 --> 00:58:36.549]  These are all martial law drills.
[00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:37.490]  Period.
[00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.791]  Well, they're not bad.
[00:58:41.306 --> 00:58:45.970]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:46.230]  Hello!
[00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:46.731]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:47.411]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.431 --> 00:58:49.013]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:49.033 --> 00:58:50.534]  You want answers?
[00:58:51.555 --> 00:58:53.657]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:09.311]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.832 --> 00:59:13.954]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.154 --> 00:59:32.126]  Alright, we've got William Rodriguez, one of the heroes of 9-11, has been on with us a few times in the last month to give us his report on the historical 9-11 conference that we had in California over the weekend.
[00:59:32.646 --> 00:59:33.949]  I want to thank all of you that did come.
[00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:35.673]  Sorry for those of you that missed it.
[00:59:36.214 --> 00:59:39.321]  Right now, though, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[00:59:39.782 --> 00:59:41.546]  Let's talk to Gideon in Iowa.
[00:59:41.586 --> 00:59:42.508]  Gideon, you're on the air.
[00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:44.654]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:59:44.694 --> 00:59:56.862]  I just wanted to say thank you so very much for stating the facts that we have got to come together as Jews, as Catholics, as Orthodox, as Protestants, all of us together because we're fighting a common enemy.
[00:59:57.083 --> 00:59:58.704]  I want to read you a quick statement.
[00:59:58.744 --> 01:00:03.307]  It says, The enemy forces, inspired by the evil spirit, ever wage war on the Christian name.
[01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:07.570]  They join forces in this endeavor with certain groups of men whose purpose is to subvertly
[01:00:08.297 --> 01:00:14.404]  To divert divine revealed truths and rend the very fabric of Christian society with disastrous dissent.
[01:00:14.804 --> 01:00:26.577]  Indeed, how much damage these cohorts, as it were, have inflicted on the church is well known, and yet the spirit of all previous groups hostile to Catholic institutions has come to life again in that group called the Masonic sect.
[01:00:27.097 --> 01:00:32.020]  Which strong in manpower and resources is the leader in a war against anything sacred?
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:41.246]  That was written in 1892 by Pope Leo XIII, and it talks about how the Catholic institutions in Italy were being invaded.
[01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:49.331]  And then fast forward, and you've got Mexico and the Cristeros uprising where they're hanging people from their arms.
[01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:53.888]  And just slashing their feet, you know?
[01:00:53.948 --> 01:00:55.429]  I mean, think about it.
[01:00:55.449 --> 01:00:57.010]  You've got 1892 in Italy.
[01:00:57.030 --> 01:01:02.435]  You've got the Pope warning the public and the bishops of Italy about Freemasonry creeping in.
[01:01:02.855 --> 01:01:03.976]  Then you've got Mussolini.
[01:01:04.857 --> 01:01:09.080]  Then you've got Mexico being taken over by the Masons.
[01:01:09.121 --> 01:01:10.462]  How much longer before it's us?
[01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:14.242]  Well, I would be clear.
[01:01:14.342 --> 01:01:17.565]  Criminal elements at the top of the Masonic order.
[01:01:17.605 --> 01:01:21.127]  Most Masons don't even know what's going on at the higher rooms.
[01:01:21.447 --> 01:01:26.171]  That's why the Mason symbol is the pyramid, because it's a symbol of compartmentalization.
[01:01:26.511 --> 01:01:31.635]  The average Mason hears us say that and doesn't understand that they're not even aware of what's going on in the higher levels.
[01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.896]  Yes, yes.
[01:01:33.976 --> 01:01:34.517]  I'm aware of that.
[01:01:34.537 --> 01:01:37.599]  I'm just trying to say that this is who our common enemy is.
[01:01:37.799 --> 01:01:38.820]  We need to get together...
[01:01:42.646 --> 01:01:47.569]  As a group of people and say, okay, these are the guys that are infiltrating our ranks.
[01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:51.192]  There was a guy that just recently up in Minnesota, he's a Catholic priest.
[01:01:51.232 --> 01:01:57.917]  He spoke out against what was called a safe touch program that they were trying to implement in Catholic schools.
[01:01:58.017 --> 01:02:02.540]  And, you know, once again, we have them causing the problem and then offering the solution.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.941]  And the solution, you know, is worsening the disease.
[01:02:05.342 --> 01:02:07.103]  And he comes out and speaks against this.
[01:02:07.503 --> 01:02:08.224]  Well, I know this.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.701]  Well, I mean, I know this.
[01:02:37.761 --> 01:02:42.242]  We need to address the evils, the world government, the open borders, the gun control.
[01:02:42.683 --> 01:02:49.325]  We need to, at every front, agree to fight those issues and agree to stand together to defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:02:49.706 --> 01:02:50.886]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:51.366 --> 01:02:53.327]  I'm going to try to jam one more call in here.
[01:02:53.407 --> 01:02:54.648]  Jim in Texas, go ahead.
[01:02:54.668 --> 01:02:56.048]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:56.649 --> 01:02:56.869]  Hi.
[01:02:57.409 --> 01:02:57.949]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:58.329 --> 01:03:02.371]  I'm over here at the Texas State Capitol Building.
[01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:12.294]  A scene of the crime that transpired on this past Sunday morning where I was arrested for exercising my First Amendment right to free speech.
[01:03:13.955 --> 01:03:16.037]  And, uh... What happened?
[01:03:16.637 --> 01:03:31.748]  Well, in addition to the police brutality, the false imprisonment, false arrest, official oppression, the whole works that they try to throw at you, they also stole my private property, which consisted of
[01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:36.391]  Some campaign signs for my nation gubernatorial campaign.
[01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:42.933]  And I came to an anti-illegal immigration rally.
[01:03:43.013 --> 01:03:43.413]  You know what?
[01:03:43.433 --> 01:03:45.514]  I'm going to have my guest on and I'll get back to you, Jim.
[01:03:45.834 --> 01:03:47.455]  We'll take a call while the guest is on with us.
[01:03:47.475 --> 01:03:48.475]  This is William Rodriguez.
[01:03:49.195 --> 01:03:51.936]  So Jim, Bradley, Cliff, Rico, others, stay there.
[01:03:53.365 --> 01:03:54.846]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.026 --> 01:03:58.107]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.247 --> 01:04:02.149]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.189 --> 01:04:06.432]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.772 --> 01:04:10.554]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.694 --> 01:04:12.535]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.695 --> 01:04:16.016]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:17.097]  The medical bills...
[01:04:18.819 --> 01:04:20.761]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:23.946]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:27.010]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:33.599]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:34.640]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.882 --> 01:05:01.508]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:12.996]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:13.216 --> 01:05:15.838]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:16.198 --> 01:05:22.661]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:22.821 --> 01:05:24.682]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:24.882 --> 01:05:30.905]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:36.828]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:37.148 --> 01:05:41.070]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:41.811]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:42.511]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.205 --> 01:05:55.025]  Come on, Bill.
[01:05:55.246 --> 01:06:00.410]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.252]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:06:02.352 --> 01:06:04.313]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:10.118]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:10.398 --> 01:06:16.684]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:06:17.004 --> 01:06:19.186]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:06:19.466 --> 01:06:22.887]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:23.547]  Whoa.
[01:06:23.947 --> 01:06:25.148]  What was that website again?
[01:06:25.228 --> 01:06:28.709]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:29.009 --> 01:06:30.129]  Now write this down, John.
[01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:34.571]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:06:34.711 --> 01:06:35.291]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:06:35.571 --> 01:06:36.772]  I'm going there right now.
[01:06:37.172 --> 01:06:37.812]  Check, please.
[01:06:39.575 --> 01:06:41.057]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:06:41.557 --> 01:06:42.138]  Sure, John.
[01:06:42.358 --> 01:06:46.702]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:06:47.023 --> 01:06:48.724]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:06:48.885 --> 01:06:49.245]  Deal.
[01:06:53.629 --> 01:06:55.852]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:55.892 --> 01:06:59.195]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:09.611]  We're good to go.
[01:07:15.538 --> 01:07:23.903]  It's been too long just popping in to give us his view on the historical 9-11 truth conference that we had in Los Angeles on the 24th and 25th.
[01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:32.829]  He did just a fabulous job in his speech, breaking down what happened on 9-11 and now his travels around the world, exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[01:07:32.869 --> 01:07:37.072]  We'll go back to your calls and a bunch of other news that we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:07:37.952 --> 01:07:40.494]  But William Rodriguez, good to talk to you again.
[01:07:41.181 --> 01:07:44.522]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you again for having me on the conference.
[01:07:44.603 --> 01:07:48.044]  It was like the greatest conference I've ever been here in the United States.
[01:07:49.044 --> 01:07:58.508]  I've been to many, many, many of them, and this one was by far the largest, and the response from the audience was overwhelming.
[01:07:58.928 --> 01:08:09.573]  The audience was so nice, so touched by everybody in terms of their information, and I tell you, we need to do a bigger one next time because this
[01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:20.056]  A lot of people were still hungry for more and more contact with us, and we were unable to reach to everybody because it was so many people.
[01:08:20.456 --> 01:08:27.637]  So we need to have more of these events, and I want to thank you personally because, oh man, you are a preacher.
[01:08:27.957 --> 01:08:29.397]  You are definitely a preacher.
[01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:37.639]  You brought everybody to tears out there because you were so good with your speech and the organization, your people, your staff.
[01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:38.739]  Kevin was great.
[01:08:39.275 --> 01:08:43.778]  I tell you, everybody went out happy from this conference and with a lot of information.
[01:08:43.818 --> 01:08:46.140]  And the media, the coverage from the media was overwhelming.
[01:08:46.841 --> 01:08:50.503]  It was fantastic and it was great to meet you in person and Jimmy Walter in person.
[01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:54.186]  I feel like I knew you guys already so many times talking to you over the years.
[01:08:54.986 --> 01:08:59.810]  Your speech, I have to tell you, people really thought that it was informative and it brought a lot of people to tears.
[01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:02.772]  Why don't you just give us a synopsis of what you did talk about?
[01:09:03.644 --> 01:09:26.077]  Well, I did speak about my experience on 9-11, how I have to survive under the rubble, how I went up the stairwells actually, floor by floor, letting people to escape for safety, and the whole thing about how I experienced explosions in the buildings in different areas on the lower levels, something that actually destroyed the
[01:09:26.653 --> 01:09:40.165]  Official story of the 9-11 Commission and how I went to Congress with a group of family members to ask for the investigation to be created and how they omitted all the information of my experience and took me to people that I made available to them.
[01:09:40.825 --> 01:09:41.626]  They were never called.
[01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:43.808]  So people were appalled, angry.
[01:09:44.168 --> 01:09:46.770]  They were in shock that this happened.
[01:09:47.071 --> 01:09:50.974]  And also, they wanted to create a call for action.
[01:09:51.635 --> 01:09:53.156]  And thanks to these...
[01:09:53.775 --> 01:09:55.036]  Uh, engagement that we had.
[01:09:55.456 --> 01:09:58.379]  I think we are able now to reach more people.
[01:09:58.439 --> 01:10:01.541]  The presence of, uh, Charlie Sheen was amazing.
[01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:02.402]  We have S.I.
[01:10:02.442 --> 01:10:05.344]  Morales, the Hollywood actor, in there as well.
[01:10:05.704 --> 01:10:11.549]  Came with a speech, uh, I'm sorry, a script writer from Hollywood, uh, Mr. Marconi.
[01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:14.431]  And, uh, I tell you, the interest from, uh,
[01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:19.596]  The general population was good, but at the same time, the Hollywood people were amazing.
[01:10:19.676 --> 01:10:27.320]  And I tell you again, I have to congratulate you because we never had something of an outreach in this way before.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:34.144]  Well, Charlie Sheen brought those two individuals, and one of them, of course, wrote Enemy of the State.
[01:10:34.184 --> 01:10:35.545]  He's got a big movie coming out.
[01:10:36.005 --> 01:10:38.126]  Not only that, your video really blew everybody away.
[01:10:38.166 --> 01:10:39.687]  Your new video is great, it's fantastic.
[01:10:39.707 --> 01:10:41.147]  I urge everybody to go to the website, infowars.com,
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:04.860]  Well, you're right.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.281]  The only problem with the conference was that it wasn't big enough.
[01:11:07.301 --> 01:11:09.501]  1,200 people, and it was overflow.
[01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:13.002]  Hundreds that couldn't get in, who tried to show up and get tickets.
[01:11:13.282 --> 01:11:14.963]  We could have easily had 3,000 people there.
[01:11:30.274 --> 01:11:30.915]  I believe so.
[01:11:31.015 --> 01:11:32.035]  I definitely believe so.
[01:11:32.216 --> 01:11:35.558]  And a lot of people have to be turned away because there were no tickets available.
[01:11:35.578 --> 01:11:36.359]  There was no space.
[01:11:36.699 --> 01:11:40.082]  And we have to abide by the fire law in the hotel.
[01:11:40.182 --> 01:11:44.745]  So, you know, I feel so sorry for a lot of people that weren't able to actually reach out to us.
[01:11:45.646 --> 01:11:55.854]  So I believe that, you know, something new and bigger should be done by you and I'd be on board right away because I think we can do something bigger next time.
[01:11:55.874 --> 01:11:57.955]  Well, it was great meeting your lovely wife as well.
[01:11:57.975 --> 01:11:58.776]  She sure is nice.
[01:11:59.727 --> 01:12:00.828]  Oh, she's gorgeous.
[01:12:00.868 --> 01:12:02.571]  She's like, I'm so in love with that woman.
[01:12:02.591 --> 01:12:05.555]  I can imagine why.
[01:12:05.575 --> 01:12:06.777]  She's very nice.
[01:12:08.079 --> 01:12:09.942]  But did she have a good time?
[01:12:10.663 --> 01:12:11.843]  She had a wonderful time.
[01:12:11.923 --> 01:12:13.024]  People were so nice.
[01:12:13.124 --> 01:12:23.226]  Like she said, she thought it was going to be a manipulation of the message like she had present in other venues.
[01:12:23.326 --> 01:12:29.487]  And she was amazed by the level of education, by the level of intelligence of the people that were there.
[01:12:29.807 --> 01:12:35.428]  This was not a regular event, like I said.
[01:12:35.448 --> 01:12:37.889]  You have, like, you know, top experts.
[01:12:38.348 --> 01:12:47.795]  You have the names of the 9-11 movement, the top names there, and at the same time, we were able to reach out to the
[01:12:49.798 --> 01:13:05.690]  The national media, which is good because... Well, you brought up a key point, and I don't want to air too much of this just because I think it can be divisive, but it is true that at other big 9-11 meetings, there's always an attempt to restrict and control and tell people what they can and can't talk about.
[01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:07.051]  We didn't do that, did we?
[01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:08.752]  We told people to talk about whatever they wanted.
[01:13:08.872 --> 01:13:11.534]  Listen, we have diverging points of view.
[01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:14.557]  I don't agree with a lot of the things that a lot of people said in the...
[01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:19.441]  But, again, the message was what was important.
[01:13:19.781 --> 01:13:30.269]  You see, we were able to put together this group of different points of view and came out to have what we call a coalition of a mission.
[01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:41.338]  And the mission is to unmask the government about the lies of what happened on 9-11, unmask the lies, and at the same time create interest from people that doesn't know anything about 9-11
[01:13:42.321 --> 01:13:44.362]  To reach out and get the information.
[01:13:44.402 --> 01:13:47.623]  Yeah, that was the main mission, and I think we really did a good job of that.
[01:13:47.643 --> 01:13:50.244]  And I want to thank you for coming to the event.
[01:13:50.284 --> 01:13:58.207]  You did an excellent job and really woke a lot of people up and increased their knowledge about what really happened on 9-11.
[01:13:58.247 --> 01:14:00.028]  William Rodriguez, where do you go from here?
[01:14:00.088 --> 01:14:09.191]  What country is next on your international tour that's already been to Venezuela, already been to Europe, already been to Japan, already been to many other areas?
[01:14:09.944 --> 01:14:12.287]  Now I'm going to Jakarta, Indonesia.
[01:14:12.788 --> 01:14:15.372]  And from Jakarta, Indonesia to South Africa.
[01:14:15.879 --> 01:14:21.202]  We are leaving on the 27th to Indonesia, coming back on August 1st.
[01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:24.084]  From August 1st, we're going to go to South Africa.
[01:14:24.404 --> 01:14:33.809]  From South Africa, we're going to go to London to have a peace conference with Yvonne Ridley, the lady that was captured by the Taliban.
[01:14:33.829 --> 01:14:44.735]  You may remember this from the BBC, the reporter, which is putting this huge international conference together in the UK, and we will be one of the keynote speakers over there as well.
[01:14:46.047 --> 01:14:47.688]  Well, that's going to be incredibly exciting.
[01:14:47.728 --> 01:14:50.369]  Are there any key websites you want to give out for anybody out there?
[01:14:51.089 --> 01:14:55.651]  Reopen911.org and definitely Infowars.com.
[01:14:56.211 --> 01:14:57.091]  Definitely that one.
[01:14:57.532 --> 01:14:58.312]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:58.552 --> 01:14:59.832]  This was such a success.
[01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:14.018]  I just want to ask you a favor and your audience, because so many people were trying to reach me and try to get in contact with me, and since I'm traveling so much, I would like that actually you serve
[01:15:14.554 --> 01:15:18.797]  Sure, so if media wants to call you, we can just pass it on to you?
[01:15:18.837 --> 01:15:19.597]  Yes, definitely.
[01:15:19.617 --> 01:15:20.498]  Please do that.
[01:15:20.538 --> 01:15:22.599]  Can we give the media your computer phone number?
[01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:23.040]  Yes, definitely.
[01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:26.142]  Okay, well we'll be glad to do that, William.
[01:15:26.162 --> 01:15:27.843]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:15:43.088 --> 01:15:48.811]  Definitely that we are going to be creating a big coalition with Alex.
[01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:51.813]  Definitely we're going to call Alex the preacher because he is great.
[01:15:51.833 --> 01:15:57.136]  If you haven't seen Alex in person doing his speech, you are going to be blown away.
[01:15:57.496 --> 01:16:08.622]  This is something that I was so shocked when I saw you in person and you moved me so much like you move everybody else in that audience.
[01:16:08.702 --> 01:16:11.524]  And I tell you, you should go into the lecture circuit
[01:16:12.136 --> 01:16:21.245]  You definitely need to do that because you have tremendous charisma, power, and you give motivation, enthusiasm, and disposition to the people that listen to you.
[01:16:21.886 --> 01:16:28.132]  And, of course, your knowledge about the facts and the events of 9-11, false flag, terrorism,
[01:16:30.009 --> 01:16:32.450]  Yes, please, please, please.
[01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:34.091]  And if you do, I will be there, definitely.
[01:16:56.181 --> 01:17:03.505]  Well, God bless you, William Rodriguez, and we will be talking to you in the very near future, and thank you for attending the event, and thank you for all your support, my friend.
[01:17:03.565 --> 01:17:04.726]  I salute you and your courage.
[01:17:05.286 --> 01:17:09.708]  Thank you so much, and I will be calling you from Indonesia to give you an update on what's happening there.
[01:17:09.728 --> 01:17:09.868]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:09.908 --> 01:17:14.411]  Please let us get you on from Indonesia, and you say you're going to be going there in late July?
[01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:15.931]  That is correct.
[01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:16.472]  All right.
[01:17:16.512 --> 01:17:17.772]  We will talk to you then, sir.
[01:17:18.072 --> 01:17:18.813]  Vaya con Dios.
[01:17:19.548 --> 01:17:20.349]  Bye.
[01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:21.049]  God bless.
[01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:22.871]  There goes William Rodriguez.
[01:17:22.891 --> 01:17:24.912]  He's really a great guy in person.
[01:17:25.033 --> 01:17:25.873]  Very passionate.
[01:17:26.214 --> 01:17:27.875]  Very charismatic in his own right.
[01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:29.429]  And he's a hero.
[01:17:29.869 --> 01:17:30.730]  Hero of 9-11.
[01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:41.353]  Went in there and helped the firefighters get hundreds of people out of the building, personally guided 15 people out, went back in, and even after explosions were going off in the base, and then the building collapsed on him.
[01:17:41.393 --> 01:17:44.634]  He was the last non-emergency personnel member to be pulled.
[01:17:44.654 --> 01:17:45.934]  I don't want to call him a civilian.
[01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:51.916]  They use that military nomenclature where the government's military, and we're, quote, civilian, but he was the last.
[01:17:52.862 --> 01:17:53.322]  Civilian.
[01:17:53.682 --> 01:17:55.343]  Pulled from the rubble alive.
[01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:21.555]  And then I want to get into how they're trying to go after reporters who exposed 9-11 NSA crimes.
[01:18:22.015 --> 01:18:24.957]  And I want to get into the latest Iran developments as well.
[01:18:25.277 --> 01:18:30.881]  We'll have a brief update next hour from one of the people detained by the Royal Mounted Police in Canada at Bilderberg.
[01:18:30.901 --> 01:18:31.942]  We had one of them on for you.
[01:18:32.362 --> 01:18:32.842]  Early last week.
[01:18:32.882 --> 01:18:35.604]  We're going to have another one on for you coming up in the next hour.
[01:18:36.024 --> 01:18:38.065]  All this and a lot more today.

[01:23:22.609 --> 01:23:29.714]  You're saying the Capitol Police, they're usually pretty nice to me, but you're saying the Capitol Police grabbed you, arrested you, took your signs.
[01:23:30.154 --> 01:23:30.634]  What happened?
[01:23:31.235 --> 01:23:33.176]  Well, they confiscated private property.
[01:23:33.276 --> 01:23:40.101]  I had campaign signs supporting my drive to become governor of Texas...
[01:23:40.751 --> 01:23:44.433]  And they didn't like what was written on them, so they just kept two or three of them, Alex.
[01:23:45.794 --> 01:23:49.516]  In addition to arresting me and then releasing me without charging me.
[01:23:50.777 --> 01:23:53.239]  Well, how long were they holding you?
[01:23:53.299 --> 01:23:55.520]  Two and a half hours.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:56.661]  I wasn't free to go.
[01:23:57.021 --> 01:24:01.324]  That is certainly an arrest by every yardstick.
[01:24:01.564 --> 01:24:02.725]  So why did they grab you?
[01:24:02.765 --> 01:24:03.405]  What was going on?
[01:24:04.766 --> 01:24:09.829]  Well, Frosty Woolridge was in town, and he brought a couple of patriots to the south steps of the Capitol.
[01:24:10.475 --> 01:24:18.599]  To voice a little publicity to our cause of keeping our country free from foreign invaders.
[01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:20.720]  And then they said you hadn't reserved the spot.
[01:24:23.302 --> 01:24:25.123]  Well, I didn't like what I was saying, Alex.
[01:24:25.463 --> 01:24:28.124]  Let me just ask you, because we always just call... Hey, Governor Perry, how are you?
[01:24:28.164 --> 01:24:30.085]  Let me just... Alex, Governor Perry, right here.
[01:24:30.585 --> 01:24:31.086]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:31.146 --> 01:24:32.046]  Glad to meet you, sir.
[01:24:32.826 --> 01:24:33.587]  Here's Alex Jones.
[01:24:33.607 --> 01:24:34.327]  Would you like to talk to him?
[01:24:34.347 --> 01:24:35.708]  What are you doing, Brother Jones?
[01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:38.411]  Hello, Rick Perry.
[01:24:38.591 --> 01:24:40.511]  You holding down the fort there?
[01:24:40.772 --> 01:24:41.752]  He sure is.
[01:24:42.052 --> 01:24:43.052]  Is this really Rick Perry?
[01:24:43.693 --> 01:24:44.713]  Oh, get out of here.
[01:24:44.993 --> 01:24:48.875]  You don't think your man here would try to trick you, do you?
[01:24:49.615 --> 01:24:51.316]  No, I don't think he would.
[01:24:52.036 --> 01:24:52.436]  It's him.
[01:24:54.017 --> 01:24:57.138]  Alex, you know he would not pull the wool over your eye.
[01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:01.320]  No, it sounds like Rick Perry.
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:02.060]  I know I do.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.421]  I do sound like him, don't I?
[01:25:03.877 --> 01:25:04.177]  It is.
[01:25:04.377 --> 01:25:05.798]  And I look like him, too, don't I?
[01:25:05.978 --> 01:25:09.939]  Well, Governor, okay, okay, did you see me in a Mexican food restaurant?
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.940]  No, were you there last night?
[01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:16.542]  Did I see you at Nuevo León?
[01:25:17.102 --> 01:25:18.823]  No, no, no, not last night.
[01:25:20.003 --> 01:25:22.604]  I was at Huero's last night.
[01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.285]  This isn't the Governor.
[01:25:24.325 --> 01:25:27.766]  Governor, did I bullhorn you into the Sente Fox?
[01:25:28.726 --> 01:25:29.567]  No, you did that.
[01:25:30.427 --> 01:25:31.447]  You totally did that.
[01:25:32.408 --> 01:25:33.188]  Out in front of the house.
[01:25:34.045 --> 01:25:36.246]  And you were sweating like a hog, man.
[01:25:36.346 --> 01:25:37.027]  No.
[01:25:37.327 --> 01:25:38.348]  You were hot.
[01:25:38.768 --> 01:25:40.989]  You were boiling hot out there, Jones.
[01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:45.132]  Well, it's like butts within the air conditioning.
[01:25:45.172 --> 01:25:47.373]  So why are you stopping and talking to Jim, Governor?
[01:25:47.413 --> 01:25:48.294]  He's running against you.
[01:25:48.754 --> 01:25:52.496]  Because he was just standing up here and he said, come on, let's visit.
[01:25:52.516 --> 01:25:53.137]  So we did.
[01:25:53.877 --> 01:25:54.557]  Why wouldn't I?
[01:25:55.558 --> 01:25:58.800]  You think I'm not a personable kind of guy?
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:25:59.881]  No, Governor.
[01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:01.302]  I think you're very personable.
[01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:02.082]  You know I am.
[01:26:02.382 --> 01:26:03.443]  You know I am.
[01:26:05.516 --> 01:26:07.357]  Okay, is this really Rick Perry?
[01:26:08.357 --> 01:26:09.598]  No way.
[01:26:10.978 --> 01:26:11.558]  I know.
[01:26:14.099 --> 01:26:15.440]  He's proselyting me now.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.940]  And I'm telling him, I said, he's got a long way to go.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.601]  Proselytizing.
[01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.021]  Well, I'm an Aggie.
[01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:23.322]  You know, that's as close as I can get, man.
[01:26:23.622 --> 01:26:27.003]  All right, Jonesy, I've got to go have lunch with my wife.
[01:26:27.043 --> 01:26:27.883]  Hold on, Governor.
[01:26:27.944 --> 01:26:29.844]  Are you going to secure our border?
[01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:30.644]  Our border?
[01:26:30.704 --> 01:26:32.565]  We are securing it as you speak, brother.
[01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:39.671]  We're making better progress than anybody else is, I'll tell you that.
[01:26:39.751 --> 01:26:43.473]  I'm just monitoring stations and cameras down there.
[01:26:43.653 --> 01:26:44.753]  We're moved on that way.
[01:26:44.873 --> 01:26:45.514]  It's serious.
[01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:46.334]  Bye, Governor.
[01:26:46.354 --> 01:26:46.834]  Thank you, sir.
[01:26:47.374 --> 01:26:48.035]  Take care.
[01:26:48.475 --> 01:26:49.395]  Was that really Perry?
[01:26:49.535 --> 01:26:52.576]  I hate to put you on the spot, Alex, but that was Governor Perry.
[01:26:53.017 --> 01:26:53.897]  It sounded like him.
[01:26:54.137 --> 01:26:55.157]  Jim, are you joking?
[01:26:55.838 --> 01:26:56.878]  I am very serious.
[01:26:57.118 --> 01:26:58.038]  Why did he get on the phone?
[01:26:58.058 --> 01:26:59.899]  There he goes to his black suburban, sir.
[01:27:00.339 --> 01:27:01.720]  And he's calling me Jonesy now.
[01:27:02.686 --> 01:27:03.606]  I guess he is.
[01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:06.387]  Did you have any of your buddies down there to catch that on videotape?
[01:27:07.207 --> 01:27:07.628]  No, sir.
[01:27:07.828 --> 01:27:08.868]  My daughter's here with me.
[01:27:09.688 --> 01:27:10.588]  Let me talk to your daughter.
[01:27:11.169 --> 01:27:11.689]  Here she is.
[01:27:12.089 --> 01:27:12.969]  Folks, I know Jim.
[01:27:13.009 --> 01:27:14.150]  Jim doesn't joke around.
[01:27:14.170 --> 01:27:14.910]  Say hi to Alex.
[01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:16.090]  Say hi to Alex.
[01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:16.610]  Hi.
[01:27:17.210 --> 01:27:17.431]  Hi.
[01:27:17.491 --> 01:27:19.031]  Was that just the governor on the phone?
[01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:19.911]  Tell him.
[01:27:20.131 --> 01:27:20.952]  Tell him it was the governor.
[01:27:21.572 --> 01:27:23.672]  It was Governor Terry.
[01:27:24.513 --> 01:27:24.853]  Well, wait.
[01:27:24.873 --> 01:27:26.673]  Your daddy just said, tell him it was the governor.
[01:27:26.733 --> 01:27:27.514]  Was it the governor?
[01:27:28.234 --> 01:27:28.774]  Yeah.
[01:27:29.634 --> 01:27:30.314]  How old are you?
[01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:31.955]  Oh, eight.
[01:27:34.845 --> 01:27:37.207]  Man, this show gets weirder and weirder every day.
[01:27:37.527 --> 01:27:39.308]  Yeah, she does not lie, Alex.
[01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:40.369]  Now, he does.
[01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:43.851]  He lies all the time.
[01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:48.855]  I know you're down there almost every day, Jim, but what in the world are you... How did you get Rick Perry on the phone?
[01:27:49.635 --> 01:27:51.016]  Well, he come walking right past me.
[01:27:51.036 --> 01:27:55.419]  I'm right here at the back door where he likes to sneak out and escape.
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.182]  Did you hear me say Mexican food?
[01:28:00.202 --> 01:28:01.623]  And he goes, were you there last night?
[01:28:03.852 --> 01:28:06.793]  Well... And I said, do you like me bull-hunting you?
[01:28:07.273 --> 01:28:09.674]  Hey, Jim, I've known you for years, and I haven't known you to lie.
[01:28:10.195 --> 01:28:13.336]  Okay, on a stack of Bibles, was that really Rick Perry?
[01:28:13.576 --> 01:28:17.117]  I swear to God, and my daughter doesn't lie either.
[01:28:17.338 --> 01:28:18.598]  No, I know Rick Perry's voice.
[01:28:18.638 --> 01:28:19.438]  That was Rick Perry.
[01:28:19.618 --> 01:28:20.259]  Oh, it was him.
[01:28:20.359 --> 01:28:22.380]  It was him, Alex.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:24.040]  How fortuitous that I went to you.
[01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:25.661]  I thought it wasn't at first.
[01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:27.081]  I should have asked him some harder questions.
[01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:27.862]  Stay there.
[01:28:27.882 --> 01:28:28.602]  We'll come right back.
[01:28:28.722 --> 01:28:30.123]  Okay, Alex.
[01:28:30.503 --> 01:28:30.863]  That's it.
[01:28:30.903 --> 01:28:33.064]  I've got to try to get Perry on this show.
[01:28:34.924 --> 01:28:36.225]  Things get weirder and weirder.
[01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:44.891]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.392 --> 01:28:46.973]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.993 --> 01:28:50.616]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.652 --> 01:28:54.413]  We're good to go.
[01:29:14.352 --> 01:29:20.658]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[01:29:20.938 --> 01:29:22.479]  Zango is revolutionary.
[01:29:22.679 --> 01:29:32.688]  Not only has Zango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Zango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[01:29:32.988 --> 01:29:35.150]  Life is short, and timing is everything.
[01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.092]  Unleash the power of Zango today.

[01:29:53.368 --> 01:29:59.592]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:59.732 --> 01:30:05.895]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.176 --> 01:30:14.601]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:14.861 --> 01:30:21.885]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.185 --> 01:30:27.008]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.228 --> 01:30:32.632]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:32.972 --> 01:30:36.054]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:36.395 --> 01:30:44.300]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:44.980]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:52.005 --> 01:30:55.086]  We're good to go.
[01:31:14.475 --> 01:31:21.360]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:21.581 --> 01:31:22.962]  There are no side effects.

[01:31:41.716 --> 01:31:42.596]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:56.835 --> 01:31:57.355]  Don't worry.
[01:31:57.815 --> 01:31:59.356]  This show is documented.
[01:31:59.856 --> 01:32:02.637]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:06.559]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:32:06.959 --> 01:32:08.259]  I went down, down, down.
[01:32:08.299 --> 01:32:10.460]  Yeah, old Rick Perry and I go way back.
[01:32:11.541 --> 01:32:15.502]  Back in 98 when Bush had me kidnapped in front of all the news cameras for asking a question.
[01:32:16.062 --> 01:32:18.623]  Perry was there getting whispered in his ear by Bush.
[01:32:18.663 --> 01:32:19.523]  That's Alex Jones.
[01:32:19.563 --> 01:32:20.224]  That's the guy who...
[01:32:21.238 --> 01:32:21.818]  We're good to go.
[01:32:42.961 --> 01:32:45.323]  Who helps with the TV show goes, that's Rick Perry, he's looking at us.
[01:32:45.803 --> 01:32:47.984]  And I turn and Rick Perry's looking right at me.
[01:32:48.484 --> 01:32:56.169]  He stares at me, he walks back out, comes back with security people, has them walking to the table, but I guess he felt like a chicken.
[01:32:56.549 --> 01:33:03.514]  So after he walks past, he turns around, walks over to our table, puts his hands on Malcolm's shoulders.
[01:33:04.469 --> 01:33:08.992]  He goes down there like twice a week and basically runs around the Capitol getting in their faces.
[01:33:32.246 --> 01:33:33.447]  Jim, I've got Marty on.
[01:33:33.467 --> 01:33:34.888]  I'm going to go to Marty here in just a second.
[01:33:35.369 --> 01:33:38.051]  But just a minute ago, live, we had Rick Perry on the show.
[01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:39.312]  Now I'm going to try to get him on as a guest.
[01:33:39.832 --> 01:33:44.376]  And usually you said he runs past you, but you told him Alex Jones is on the phone.
[01:33:44.637 --> 01:33:45.377]  Tell him the story.
[01:33:45.838 --> 01:33:46.638]  Tell us how it happened.
[01:33:47.739 --> 01:33:56.387]  Well, he comes out of the south side of the Capitol door, and I'm standing here on the phone with you talking about a different thing altogether.
[01:33:57.168 --> 01:33:57.248]  And...
[01:33:58.106 --> 01:34:01.607]  I thought maybe you'd like to have a conversation with him, so I gave him my phone.
[01:34:02.668 --> 01:34:04.828]  And sure enough, he knows who you are.
[01:34:04.848 --> 01:34:10.170]  Now, you said talk to Alex Jones, but you said usually you basically chase him to his suburban.
[01:34:10.190 --> 01:34:11.471]  This time he didn't do that to you.
[01:34:12.111 --> 01:34:14.112]  No, well... What did you say this time?
[01:34:14.132 --> 01:34:15.292]  What did you say to him exactly?
[01:34:16.212 --> 01:34:18.573]  Governor Perry, hey, I've got Alex Jones on the phone.
[01:34:18.613 --> 01:34:19.593]  Why don't you talk to him?
[01:34:20.214 --> 01:34:21.174]  And I handed it to him.
[01:34:21.614 --> 01:34:26.676]  Of course, I was standing between him and his black suburban limousine, and...
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.961]  So he couldn't exactly, you know, either had to walk around me or take the phone.
[01:34:32.301 --> 01:34:32.561]  Sure.
[01:34:33.361 --> 01:34:35.681]  And he's a knockaway.
[01:34:35.721 --> 01:34:40.802]  And I told him, I don't know if you could hear it remotely because he had the phone and I didn't.
[01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.603]  Yes, he went a little longer, Dylan, but you were yelling at him.
[01:34:43.703 --> 01:34:44.243]  I did hear it.
[01:34:44.983 --> 01:34:45.303]  Right.
[01:34:45.323 --> 01:34:49.624]  And I told him, I said, Governor Perry, you're losing votes even as we speak right now.
[01:34:50.024 --> 01:34:51.364]  But I want you to vote for me.
[01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:54.645]  But I chased him to his...
[01:34:55.529 --> 01:34:59.511]  Chauffeured limousine here a couple months ago with bullhorn in hand.
[01:35:01.092 --> 01:35:04.835]  And he literally did, Alex, he literally did run and get in his vehicle.
[01:35:04.855 --> 01:35:08.697]  Of course, I can come on over and tap on his darkly tinted windows.
[01:35:08.857 --> 01:35:11.238]  But he didn't run this time.
[01:35:11.258 --> 01:35:12.739]  Was he smiling when he was on the phone?
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.760]  He was having a good time.
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.121]  He was smiling, laughing.
[01:35:16.141 --> 01:35:20.584]  Hey, Jim, you've got to start tearing a video camera, Bubba.
[01:35:21.744 --> 01:35:22.405]  I guess I should.
[01:35:22.425 --> 01:35:23.445]  They're like, a good one's $300 now.
[01:35:25.559 --> 01:35:25.919]  345 or so.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.760]  Yeah, I got one.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:29.820]  Don't carry it very often.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.401]  You need to train your daughter there to videotape for you.
[01:35:33.941 --> 01:35:34.681]  Yeah.
[01:35:34.741 --> 01:35:35.382]  How old is she?
[01:35:36.002 --> 01:35:36.602]  She's 11.
[01:35:36.862 --> 01:35:37.342]  Savannah.
[01:35:38.102 --> 01:35:38.702]  She's 11.
[01:35:38.742 --> 01:35:40.343]  She's my campaign manager, Alex.
[01:35:42.523 --> 01:35:43.704]  Oh, Jim, you're something else.
[01:35:44.444 --> 01:35:45.524]  She knows Governor Perry.
[01:35:45.544 --> 01:35:46.444]  She's met him before.
[01:35:46.524 --> 01:35:47.164]  Sure, sure.
[01:35:47.224 --> 01:35:48.905]  So what else?
[01:35:49.005 --> 01:35:51.565]  So after the governor was done, did he run to his limo?
[01:35:54.788 --> 01:36:02.333]  No, he calmly walked to his limo because he'd had a good time, and he got safely off the phone with you without too much damage being done.
[01:36:02.353 --> 01:36:06.475]  Well, I spent the first minute or two trying to figure it out, but I was like, this sounds like Rick Perry.
[01:36:06.835 --> 01:36:07.056]  Yeah.
[01:36:07.096 --> 01:36:08.196]  And you are at the Capitol.
[01:36:08.236 --> 01:36:10.678]  I know you kind of sneak around there all day.
[01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:12.339]  Well, there's no sneaking around about it.
[01:36:12.359 --> 01:36:13.539]  You're like an ogre down there.
[01:36:16.121 --> 01:36:22.465]  Well, I'm waiting to go in to talk to Captain Vargas about reclaiming my private property.
[01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:24.126]  So why did they say they took your signs?
[01:36:25.376 --> 01:36:26.838]  They didn't like the mess that was on them.
[01:36:26.858 --> 01:36:28.801]  It's in the border.
[01:36:28.821 --> 01:36:34.729]  I had one... Of course, I have my Jim Dillon for Governor signs.
[01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:35.631]  I have to do that.
[01:36:37.889 --> 01:36:44.971]  Well, you know, the state police eight years ago lost, what was it, four $100,000 suits.
[01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:53.794]  Well, the suits were for like a million apiece, but each person got $100,000 the last time they did that, so they've been behaving themselves.
[01:36:53.994 --> 01:36:59.456]  Oh, I told them Sunday when they arrested me, I said, you guys have nothing?
[01:36:59.952 --> 01:37:01.253]  I would advise you to release me.
[01:37:01.273 --> 01:37:02.854]  You're going to lose your job over this.
[01:37:03.394 --> 01:37:04.695]  I'm going to sew your pants off.
[01:37:04.775 --> 01:37:06.596]  Well, that's why they let me bullhorn Perry.
[01:37:06.776 --> 01:37:08.758]  For those that don't know, we've never put the video on the web.
[01:37:09.078 --> 01:37:10.279]  I dug it out of storage.
[01:37:10.519 --> 01:37:12.380]  Let me just tell the story, Dylan, and we've got to go to our guest.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.323]  I dug it out of storage last week.
[01:37:18.192 --> 01:37:22.236]  I have the video where I bullhorned Vicente Fox from 25 feet away.
[01:37:22.556 --> 01:37:25.318]  Yeah, that was three or four years ago.
[01:37:25.338 --> 01:37:30.703]  Yeah, they tried to come out for a press conference, and they couldn't even talk.
[01:37:30.783 --> 01:37:34.466]  I shut them down, and I guess Perry didn't forget that, did he?
[01:37:34.727 --> 01:37:35.427]  He's right.
[01:37:35.788 --> 01:37:36.989]  I was sweating like a hog.
[01:37:37.009 --> 01:37:38.250]  Yes, you were.
[01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:39.271]  You were working hard.
[01:37:39.331 --> 01:37:41.893]  You were working hard, Alex, and there's nothing wrong with sweating.
[01:37:42.213 --> 01:37:43.374]  That's why I built this country.
[01:37:43.674 --> 01:37:44.234]  I know that.
[01:37:44.514 --> 01:37:48.656]  Hey, Jim, Jim, call me later this week and let me know exactly what happened to you.
[01:37:48.676 --> 01:37:49.236]  I'm out of time.
[01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.117]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:50.217 --> 01:37:50.797]  Okay, Alex.
[01:37:50.857 --> 01:37:51.417]  Have a good one.
[01:37:51.997 --> 01:37:54.799]  Jim Dillon ought to be our reporter down there while he runs for governor.
[01:37:54.839 --> 01:37:57.260]  That way he can sneak up on these people all the time.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:01.061]  One time I had the Speaker of the House many years ago walk up and tell me he was a big fan.
[01:38:02.442 --> 01:38:03.582]  So they all watch the show.
[01:38:03.622 --> 01:38:04.383]  They listen to the show.
[01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:05.680]  We're good to go.
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:06.080]  We're good to go.
[01:38:25.081 --> 01:38:25.802]  We're good to go.
[01:38:46.127 --> 01:38:50.830]  Marty, we are going from the governor of Texas to you, and I think you're a lot more important than him.
[01:38:50.850 --> 01:38:53.912]  Hey, Alex, let's clean up America.
[01:38:53.932 --> 01:38:56.754]  Yeah, we need to send Rick Perry some of your soap.
[01:38:57.755 --> 01:38:58.736]  That's a good idea.
[01:38:58.856 --> 01:38:59.776]  Yeah, he sure needs it.
[01:39:00.417 --> 01:39:07.221]  Marty, tell us about the best organic, the cheapest organic shelf out there, what, 59 years of operation?
[01:39:07.882 --> 01:39:12.705]  Right, well, we offer a year's supply of pure soap products every,
[01:39:13.038 --> 01:39:17.620]  That's made in America for Americans to be used by Americans.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:19.101]  These are real soaps.
[01:39:19.561 --> 01:39:22.643]  The one-year supply weighs out at 65 pounds.
[01:39:23.043 --> 01:39:27.585]  That's equal to 2,000 pounds of detergents in the supermarket.
[01:39:28.106 --> 01:39:29.886]  Now these are triple concentrated.
[01:39:30.307 --> 01:39:35.029]  They will last one up to two years for a family of four.
[01:39:35.589 --> 01:39:38.711]  We've been making this, again, for almost 60 years.
[01:39:39.291 --> 01:39:40.872]  Nothing like it in America.
[01:39:41.325 --> 01:39:44.687]  The costs are nothing like it, available anywhere.
[01:39:44.707 --> 01:39:50.732]  This is the greatest bargain that can be produced by us for the American consumer.
[01:39:51.272 --> 01:39:55.735]  This is $125 plus United parcel to your door.
[01:39:56.115 --> 01:39:57.316]  Now what does that break down to?
[01:39:57.336 --> 01:39:58.337]  It breaks down to $3.25 a week.
[01:39:58.357 --> 01:39:59.918]  Now what's it costing you now?
[01:40:04.628 --> 01:40:14.331]  For your laundry soap and bath soap and hair soap and dish soap and all-purpose cleaners and all the different chemicals and sprays and poisons and toxic that you don't need.
[01:40:14.451 --> 01:40:18.012]  What is it, like 24 or 22 percent of the average budget?
[01:40:18.032 --> 01:40:21.673]  This is mainstream numbers that someone spends on chemicals?
[01:40:22.094 --> 01:40:26.595]  If a family spends $100 a week, 20 percent of that goes for cleaning chemicals.
[01:40:26.895 --> 01:40:28.156]  Thought it was $22, but okay.
[01:40:28.476 --> 01:40:32.860]  Well, from $20 to $22, that's still a minimum of $20 a week.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:38.904]  That's over $1,000 a year going down the drain with nothing to show for it.
[01:40:39.185 --> 01:40:51.974]  How do you guys, you're certified organic, it's on your website, the state of California and others, how do you guys sell super good organic pure subs made out of nothing but plants, plant oils, citrus oils, how do you do it and save 85%?
[01:40:53.482 --> 01:40:53.863]  Simple.
[01:40:54.243 --> 01:40:55.905]  We eliminated the middleman.
[01:40:56.165 --> 01:41:02.593]  We eliminated the jobber, the wholesaler, the salesman, everybody that marks up the product.
[01:41:02.633 --> 01:41:10.622]  We're factory direct, and we can give the American consumer greatest bargain in cleaning products they've ever had
[01:41:11.129 --> 01:41:13.970]  Products that are twice as good as what they're using now.
[01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:20.032]  Well, Marty, I want to challenge people and call and get the beautiful free catalog or get the $14 sampler pack.
[01:41:20.252 --> 01:41:22.793]  What do you get in the $14 sampler pack?
[01:41:23.113 --> 01:41:27.215]  Well, it's a six-pound package of the four basic soaps.
[01:41:27.615 --> 01:41:31.096]  Bath soap, air soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[01:41:31.536 --> 01:41:34.157]  Nylon scouring pad, book of instructions.
[01:41:34.637 --> 01:41:35.097]  All this, $14.
[01:41:36.969 --> 01:41:38.130]  Plus United parcel.
[01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:41.231]  It could be about $10.50 to ship to your door.
[01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:45.993]  We're talking about a product here that will last anywhere from four to eight weeks.
[01:41:46.353 --> 01:41:48.654]  We want the products to speak for themselves.
[01:41:49.364 --> 01:41:55.169]  Once you use our bar soap for your shower or bathtub, there's nothing like it in the world.
[01:41:55.509 --> 01:42:00.052]  Your skin will be alive, refreshed, clean, flexible.
[01:42:00.332 --> 01:42:06.057]  No perfumes, no dyes, no chlorides, no chemicals, no lanolin.
[01:42:06.137 --> 01:42:07.698]  We don't need all those chemicals.
[01:42:07.738 --> 01:42:15.244]  Just 80% cocoa butter, 20% vegetable oils, and you've got yourself a product that no one has.
[01:42:15.723 --> 01:42:21.507]  And we're very stubborn, very old-fashioned, and very conservative in our Pure Cell products.
[01:42:22.207 --> 01:42:31.974]  Folks should call you right now to get the free catalog or at least the $14 tote bag, an incredible value, or get a year's supply or get a two-year supply, whatever you want.
[01:42:32.574 --> 01:42:34.055]  You'll save a lot of money on this.
[01:42:34.095 --> 01:42:35.416]  In fact, you did the calculation.
[01:42:35.836 --> 01:42:40.740]  This will save people almost, not as much, but almost as much in a year.
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:45.543]  The savings you get from this will cancel out the increased gas prices, Marty.
[01:42:46.044 --> 01:42:46.684]  Exactly.
[01:42:46.704 --> 01:42:48.187]  Give people the toll-free number.
[01:42:48.207 --> 01:42:48.247]  800-340-7091.
[01:42:48.267 --> 01:42:48.447]  That's 800-340-7091.
[01:42:48.487 --> 01:42:50.690]  Or you can quickly check us on the web, 5 Star Soap.
[01:43:02.915 --> 01:43:03.396]  We're good to go.
[01:43:19.232 --> 01:43:22.214]  We create love affairs with all our clients.
[01:43:43.101 --> 01:43:44.322]  Well, I was in the Army in 1945 to 47.
[01:44:12.802 --> 01:44:13.463]  We're good to go.
[01:44:29.867 --> 01:44:32.368]  And he says, you know, they're selling detergents.
[01:44:32.829 --> 01:44:37.231]  Now, I knew about detergents because I was in chemical warfare in Japan.
[01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:39.712]  And I said, detergents are harmful.
[01:44:40.013 --> 01:44:41.994]  They're not worth the cost.
[01:44:42.354 --> 01:44:43.915]  They're made from waste products.
[01:44:44.415 --> 01:44:49.478]  So I said, why don't we start a little soap company and convert people back to good old-fashioned soap?
[01:44:49.918 --> 01:44:50.999]  And that's how we started.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:59.388]  And by the way, I've had family and friends that look at your bars of soap and they go, I stayed in a five-star hotel once and this is what they had.
[01:44:59.809 --> 01:45:03.593]  Your soaps are in the best hospitals and the most luxurious hotels.
[01:45:03.933 --> 01:45:06.316]  Why is that the only place I've ever seen your soap?
[01:45:07.239 --> 01:45:11.624]  Well, because we originally started our company only selling institutions.
[01:45:12.145 --> 01:45:15.489]  Hotels, hospitals, school departments, retirement centers.
[01:45:15.829 --> 01:45:21.176]  We did not know how to get to the consumer from Proctor, Lever, and Colgate.
[01:45:21.516 --> 01:45:24.920]  We were too young and too inexperienced and too immature.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:27.243]  And it took about three years ago.
[01:45:27.785 --> 01:45:32.291]  I got a phone call from Michael Trudeau at Genesis Communication Network.
[01:45:32.651 --> 01:45:34.253]  He says, I've heard about your products.
[01:45:34.553 --> 01:45:37.717]  How would you like to advertise them on the radio to the consumers?
[01:45:38.278 --> 01:45:41.462]  Well, I was in deep shock then because I never thought of that.
[01:45:41.842 --> 01:45:47.189]  And that's how we started with Genesis telling the people they have freedom of choice.
[01:45:47.628 --> 01:45:52.110]  They don't have to buy all ties and all... Has that helped your business?
[01:45:52.770 --> 01:45:56.132]  Considerably, because we went direct to the consumer.
[01:45:56.452 --> 01:45:58.433]  We did not go to a store.
[01:45:58.753 --> 01:46:00.294]  We didn't mark up the products.
[01:46:00.554 --> 01:46:05.116]  We sold it factory direct, and we still got people after all these years.
[01:46:05.516 --> 01:46:09.059]  Buying our products for themselves, their new families, or whatever.
[01:46:09.139 --> 01:46:09.560]  All right.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.844]  Marty, let me give people the number.
[01:46:14.864 --> 01:46:15.705]  800-340-791.
[01:46:15.725 --> 01:46:16.065]  800-340-791.
[01:46:16.345 --> 01:46:17.226]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:46:17.246 --> 01:46:18.247]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:46:18.667 --> 01:46:19.348]  Alex, thank you.
[01:46:19.368 --> 01:46:21.150]  Let me close with a little tiny poem.
[01:46:22.511 --> 01:46:24.532]  A bee's a busy little soul.
[01:46:24.552 --> 01:46:27.575]  He has no time for birth control.
[01:46:27.595 --> 01:46:30.858]  That is why in times like these...
[01:46:31.502 --> 01:46:34.984]  We have so many sons of bees.
[01:46:35.124 --> 01:46:36.005]  Take care, my friend.
[01:46:36.025 --> 01:46:36.745]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:46:36.805 --> 01:46:37.486]  There goes Marty.
[01:46:37.506 --> 01:46:38.166]  What a character.
[01:46:38.667 --> 01:46:41.769]  Again, you pay less money for something that's totally organic and wonderful.
[01:46:41.789 --> 01:46:49.514]  I always would use the detergent soaps, and once a month or so, I'd leave it under my arms or between my legs, wherever you clean.
[01:46:50.014 --> 01:46:53.856]  And then about noon, you start burning, and you've got to run home and take a shower.
[01:46:54.677 --> 01:46:56.858]  I can leave a little bit of this soap under my arms, folks.
[01:46:56.898 --> 01:46:57.479]  It doesn't happen.
[01:46:58.237 --> 01:46:59.258]  It's just so good.
[01:46:59.818 --> 01:47:00.718]  Creams, you name it.
[01:47:00.738 --> 01:47:07.082]  1-800-340-0791 or 5starsub.com Okay, we have him on once a month.
[01:47:07.122 --> 01:47:11.184]  Thanks for bearing with us, but it's important information and I really do believe in it.
[01:47:11.244 --> 01:47:11.984]  Who's up next here?
[01:47:12.004 --> 01:47:12.965]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:47:14.325 --> 01:47:15.306]  Bradley in Tennessee.
[01:47:15.326 --> 01:47:16.026]  You're a trooper.
[01:47:16.066 --> 01:47:16.786]  You're on the air.
[01:47:16.947 --> 01:47:17.647]  Go ahead, Bradley.
[01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:19.190]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:26.514]  I'd like to give you guys a special thanks for standing up to the New World Order and actually putting your lives on the line for our future.
[01:47:26.534 --> 01:47:28.915]  What did you think of that governor bit earlier?
[01:47:28.935 --> 01:47:31.536]  Well, I thought that was pretty crazy.
[01:47:32.357 --> 01:47:38.420]  He got on the phone and, of course, I couldn't tell if he was being friendly to you or being, you know, rude.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:40.080]  He was being sarcastic.
[01:47:40.661 --> 01:47:41.501]  Yeah.
[01:47:42.201 --> 01:47:47.684]  Well, look, what I'd like to talk about is all of these new Hollywood...
[01:47:48.537 --> 01:47:54.141]  Celebrities that are starting to come out and talk about the 9-11 issue.
[01:47:54.761 --> 01:47:58.303]  But as far as Charlie Sheen goes, I know he's sincere.
[01:47:58.923 --> 01:48:01.785]  I can tell whenever I listen to the way that he speaks.
[01:48:02.866 --> 01:48:16.634]  But like this new guy, Tom, from Blink-182, I'm not going to say that he's fake or not, but what I would like to say is that in the past, there have been
[01:48:17.265 --> 01:48:30.292]  Yeah, but they'll work with celebrities to get up on television, like I saw this weekend, and say how great the war is.
[01:48:30.372 --> 01:48:32.813]  It won't be 9-11's an inside job.
[01:48:34.154 --> 01:48:34.434]  Right.
[01:48:36.175 --> 01:48:42.258]  In the future, though, what I expect to see once more and more people start coming out and talking about it
[01:48:43.138 --> 01:49:00.386]  Is perhaps some celebrities that will say, oh, you know, 9-11 was an inside job, or it wasn't done by Al-Qaeda, and associate themselves with the 9-11 truth movement, and then turn around to their fan base and say, oh, well, you know, I did research into that, and it's a bunch of bull, it's just a conspiracy theory.
[01:49:01.447 --> 01:49:05.949]  Sure, well, anything like that can happen, sir, but again, you can tell when something's genuine and when it isn't.
[01:49:07.236 --> 01:49:10.657]  I mean, government agents, I don't think are going to say it's an inside job to begin with.
[01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:11.617]  They're going to do the opposite.
[01:49:11.957 --> 01:49:13.878]  They're going to attack us, and they have been attacking us.
[01:49:14.178 --> 01:49:16.918]  Or they'll pose as patriots and then say we're agents.
[01:49:18.639 --> 01:49:18.959]  I see.
[01:49:19.899 --> 01:49:24.680]  Yeah, believe me, the New World Order doesn't come right out and say that it was involved in the attacks, okay?
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.141]  Believe me, they're scared to death of that.
[01:49:27.181 --> 01:49:29.881]  But I appreciate your call, and I appreciate your concern.
[01:49:30.662 --> 01:49:31.782]  You wouldn't believe...
[01:49:32.916 --> 01:49:45.126]  The music group, one of the biggest in the world right now, there's actually two groups that I have talked to personally, this office has, who are on the verge of going public.
[01:49:45.787 --> 01:49:48.469]  They make Blink-182 look like a tiddlywink.
[01:49:51.332 --> 01:49:52.172]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.434 --> 01:49:57.317]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.021 --> 01:49:59.302]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.502 --> 01:50:05.244]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.524 --> 01:50:10.766]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.067 --> 01:50:15.228]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.408 --> 01:50:19.170]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.450 --> 01:50:24.072]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.172 --> 01:50:30.416]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.456 --> 01:50:32.337]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:50:32.777 --> 01:50:34.859]  Order 911 The Road to Terry today.
[01:50:34.939 --> 01:50:39.221]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:50:46.586 --> 01:50:48.587]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[01:50:48.828 --> 01:50:50.328]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:50.509 --> 01:50:52.590]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:53.487 --> 01:51:00.993]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.274 --> 01:51:12.203]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.363 --> 01:51:12.763]  We're good to go.
[01:51:28.943 --> 01:51:29.444]  That's right.
[01:51:29.604 --> 01:51:36.731]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:37.031 --> 01:51:45.780]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:13.861]  Man, I love that song.
[01:53:15.641 --> 01:53:16.802]  That's a groove right there.
[01:53:16.822 --> 01:53:19.823]  I'm having a little bit too much fun today.
[01:53:19.843 --> 01:53:20.583]  I've got to knock it off.
[01:53:23.344 --> 01:53:24.685]  Let's continue with some of your phone calls.
[01:53:24.725 --> 01:53:31.287]  I will get into Lord Limbaugh, the latest Iran situation, a bunch of other police state news on the NSA front, filling out for reporters to try to expose it.
[01:53:31.327 --> 01:53:33.068]  Just very briefly before I go back to calls.
[01:53:34.369 --> 01:53:34.749]  It's out.
[01:53:34.869 --> 01:53:35.249]  It's here.
[01:53:35.369 --> 01:53:35.970]  I'm not waiting.
[01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:38.010]  I'm putting out this first version of Terror Storm.
[01:53:38.531 --> 01:53:43.212]  It's about four minutes longer than the final version that will be on the official DVD in about a month.
[01:53:43.512 --> 01:53:45.893]  We can't wait on this, so we're burning them right here in-house.
[01:53:45.913 --> 01:53:47.854]  They work on all DVD players.
[01:53:48.334 --> 01:53:51.575]  I burned about 1,100 copies before I went to California.
[01:53:51.595 --> 01:53:52.996]  We've got about 450 left.
[01:53:53.296 --> 01:53:55.237]  When those are gone, then you'll have to wait.
[01:53:55.842 --> 01:53:56.343]  We're good to go.
[01:54:13.281 --> 01:54:18.086]  And we're uploading the big Bilderberg group report we put together for you today.
[01:54:18.406 --> 01:54:19.267]  That'll be up today.
[01:54:19.447 --> 01:54:26.373]  And in a few days, we're going to have about an hour and a half long synopsis of the conference up on Google Video for everybody for free.
[01:54:27.406 --> 01:54:28.647]  That's the great part about Google Video.
[01:54:28.747 --> 01:54:36.212]  I couldn't put video out, big ones for free, because it might cost $5,000 or $6,000 for one video in a month to do it if a couple million people watch it.
[01:54:36.492 --> 01:54:38.433]  But with Google Video we can.
[01:54:38.533 --> 01:54:43.177]  So now we've started Google Video-ing here and just putting it out for free.
[01:54:43.217 --> 01:54:50.081]  But we're going to put the whole conference up, my whole conference, all the big speakers and a lot of other good stuff, up there in the next week or two.
[01:54:50.101 --> 01:54:54.424]  We're going to keep uploading the different speeches for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:54:54.464 --> 01:54:57.166]  So there's a reason to be a PrisonPlanet.tv member right there.
[01:54:58.147 --> 01:55:02.471]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Cliff in Idaho.
[01:55:02.531 --> 01:55:03.252]  Cliff, welcome.
[01:55:04.393 --> 01:55:05.875]  Cliff hung up right as I was going to him.
[01:55:05.895 --> 01:55:06.495]  Good job, Cliff.
[01:55:06.535 --> 01:55:06.916]  I'm joking.
[01:55:07.316 --> 01:55:07.777]  Rico.
[01:55:08.730 --> 01:55:10.690]  Rico, you're on the air with a cool name.
[01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:11.751]  Where are you calling from?
[01:55:12.011 --> 01:55:12.531]  Toronto, buddy.
[01:55:12.871 --> 01:55:13.251]  Welcome.
[01:55:13.731 --> 01:55:14.031]  Okay.
[01:55:14.971 --> 01:55:16.252]  I got a two-part question for you.
[01:55:16.532 --> 01:55:16.772]  Sure.
[01:55:17.092 --> 01:55:18.812]  And, by the way, great work.
[01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:19.532]  Thank you.
[01:55:19.732 --> 01:55:20.173]  Keep doing it.
[01:55:20.193 --> 01:55:20.613]  Keep banging.
[01:55:21.233 --> 01:55:21.753]  Two-part question.
[01:55:22.033 --> 01:55:24.153]  How do you see them both using the U.S.
[01:55:24.273 --> 01:55:28.534]  as like a Trojan horse for worldwide control and both making the U.S.
[01:55:28.554 --> 01:55:35.616]  a fraud because no superpower can be allowed to exist if the New World Order has to come into being?
[01:55:36.036 --> 01:55:39.358]  You have hit the nail through the board, through the center of the earth.
[01:55:39.898 --> 01:55:40.799]  That's it in a nutshell.
[01:55:41.559 --> 01:55:44.601]  America is to be the new evil empire in the world's eyes.
[01:55:44.981 --> 01:55:47.783]  Domestic propaganda makes us think we're still the good guys.
[01:55:48.103 --> 01:55:58.529]  We take over a bunch of countries for the globalists, hand it over to the UN, the IMF, NATO, and then we are seen as the bad guys and financially totally implode into a third world police state.
[01:55:58.909 --> 01:56:00.090]  That is the official plan.
[01:56:00.230 --> 01:56:03.932]  Use us over the next five years as a global engine of empire and then implode us.
[01:56:05.230 --> 01:56:05.610]  That's right.
[01:56:05.770 --> 01:56:06.371]  That's it, brother.
[01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:07.472]  That's exactly the plan.
[01:56:07.832 --> 01:56:08.433]  Thank you so much.
[01:56:09.294 --> 01:56:09.714]  Is that it?
[01:56:10.555 --> 01:56:11.095]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:56:11.115 --> 01:56:15.279]  I just wanted to kind of see your vision of how they're going to do it.
[01:56:15.319 --> 01:56:16.380]  I know that's the plan.
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:20.023]  I just want to see how they're going to basically... Because I know they're developing the U.S.
[01:56:20.063 --> 01:56:20.423]  dollar.
[01:56:20.924 --> 01:56:26.329]  If you look at it compared to the Canadian, it used to be three or four years ago, it used to be $50,000.
[01:56:26.369 --> 01:56:27.670]  Now it's almost on par.
[01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:32.354]  And by 2007, they said early, it'll be dollar per dollar.
[01:56:33.294 --> 01:56:34.474]  Well, I mean, I was in Canada.
[01:56:34.514 --> 01:56:36.135]  It's already dollar for dollar with Canada.
[01:56:36.995 --> 01:56:37.275]  Really?
[01:56:37.715 --> 01:56:41.455]  Oh, yeah, I was in Canada, and it's now the same.
[01:56:42.176 --> 01:56:43.196]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:43.276 --> 01:56:48.077]  Yeah, no, I was up there in the capital, and it was dollar for dollar everywhere.
[01:56:48.137 --> 01:56:52.598]  Every restaurant, every place we went, that's what happened.
[01:56:53.018 --> 01:56:54.878]  I even exchanged some money there at the exchange.
[01:56:54.918 --> 01:56:56.618]  I think the dollar was a few pennies above it.
[01:56:57.878 --> 01:57:00.719]  So, I mean, there's another illustration right there for you.
[01:57:01.883 --> 01:57:04.844]  We will start the third hour here momentarily.
[01:57:05.964 --> 01:57:08.085]  And we will go to many others that are patiently holding.
[01:57:08.105 --> 01:57:08.245]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:08.285 --> 01:57:18.388]  I'm going to get just a quick report from one of the two individuals, one of the three individuals, that was detained by the Royal Mounted Police for simply being out there protesting the Bilderberg Group.
[01:57:19.128 --> 01:57:20.768]  And get their take on what happened to them.
[01:57:20.808 --> 01:57:23.289]  We'll tell you about their website where they detail the story as well.
[01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:25.890]  Got a link to that up on Infowars.com.
[01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:27.070]  All right.
[01:57:27.730 --> 01:57:29.511]  Third hour is only 70 seconds away.
[01:57:31.457 --> 01:57:31.937]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.439 --> 01:57:38.283]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.323 --> 01:57:38.783]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.943 --> 01:57:39.744]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.944 --> 01:57:42.947]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:43.647 --> 01:57:46.890]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.397 --> 01:57:57.277]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.298 --> 01:58:01.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.303 --> 01:58:15.906]  Yeah, we have confirmed that was Rick Perry who was on the line with us for a couple minutes in the last hour.
[01:58:17.187 --> 01:58:18.288]  That's just classic.
[01:58:18.988 --> 01:58:22.950]  Calling me Jonesy and saying I was sweating like a pig the time I bullhorned him.
[01:58:25.347 --> 01:58:25.848]  I love it.
[01:58:25.968 --> 01:58:26.409]  I love it.
[01:58:26.449 --> 01:58:28.431]  We're having an effect on these people.
[01:58:29.753 --> 01:58:33.919]  Now we've got Alex, Dave, James, Dan, a lot of other callers we're going to be getting to.
[01:58:33.939 --> 01:58:37.644]  We have a quick little guest to update us on what the Bilderberg Group did to them up in Canada.
[01:58:38.431 --> 01:58:40.112]  Right now, let's talk to Alex up in Canada, in Vancouver.
[01:58:40.132 --> 01:58:40.452]  Welcome, Alex!
[01:59:02.703 --> 01:59:03.203]  Thank you.
[01:59:03.363 --> 01:59:04.804]  Thank you very much, Mr. Jones.
[01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:08.426]  I just wanted to compliment you on your new movie.
[01:59:08.466 --> 01:59:14.028]  I checked it out last night online and it's great, just like all your other work.
[01:59:14.929 --> 01:59:17.930]  I just had an interesting fact for you guys.
[01:59:18.330 --> 01:59:24.613]  You know how our border patrol, our border cops can't carry guns?
[01:59:26.254 --> 01:59:27.194]  Which is ridiculous.
[01:59:27.454 --> 01:59:30.035]  But then your regular cops carry guns for you, the citizens.
[01:59:30.235 --> 01:59:30.676]  Well, get this.
[01:59:32.225 --> 01:59:42.967]  If you're taking the SkyTrain, which is kind of our subway that runs above ground, our SkyTrain security guys carry guns now.
[01:59:43.567 --> 01:59:44.047]  No, I know.
[01:59:44.287 --> 01:59:50.829]  Anybody on key infrastructure in these western countries, except for the U.S., isn't allowed to be armed.
[01:59:50.849 --> 01:59:52.889]  But if you're oppressing the people, then you can be armed.
[01:59:53.369 --> 01:59:56.050]  Yeah, it's really, really ridiculous.
[01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.950]  You know, you can...
[01:59:58.010 --> 02:00:09.253]  Run the border and not be afraid of getting shot, but if you don't pay your $2.25 for your ticket, you could end up in a casket if your day's not going that well.
[02:00:09.613 --> 02:00:10.834]  I know, and they've got U.S.
[02:00:10.874 --> 02:00:22.177]  cops, including Texas State Police, mainstream news folks in Canada, training your people how to run checkpoints and violate... What's the equivalent of your Fourth Amendment up in Canada?
[02:00:22.217 --> 02:00:23.377]  I know you've got something like that.
[02:00:23.837 --> 02:00:25.038]  Oh, I've got no idea.
[02:00:25.618 --> 02:00:26.018]  Where are I?
[02:00:26.573 --> 02:00:32.418]  I think we're joining you guys for the trip down the toilet bowl here.
[02:00:32.438 --> 02:00:35.001]  I think so, yeah.
[02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:36.222]  Along with Mexico, eh?
[02:00:36.522 --> 02:00:38.744]  Yep, we're all going down the same toilet bowl together.
[02:00:38.884 --> 02:00:39.945]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:00:40.045 --> 02:00:43.829]  So we'll see you all down there.
[02:00:45.090 --> 02:00:46.471]  Just one more question.
[02:00:47.032 --> 02:00:50.295]  How often do you check your MySpace page?
[02:00:51.235 --> 02:00:53.356]  I personally check it probably once a day.
[02:00:53.376 --> 02:00:54.296]  Once a day?
[02:00:54.516 --> 02:00:56.657]  Yeah, I mean, I go look at it about once a day.
[02:00:56.677 --> 02:00:57.738]  We're updating it right now.
[02:00:57.778 --> 02:00:59.138]  It hasn't been updated in about a week.
[02:00:59.538 --> 02:01:04.020]  All right, yeah, because I just added you, but I guess you haven't checked it for a bit.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:12.383]  Well, every time we go to add new friends, there's like 300 new people, so sometimes my people get busy and we don't add new friends for a couple days.
[02:01:12.423 --> 02:01:13.644]  You need another Alex on there.
[02:01:13.664 --> 02:01:14.904]  Well, yeah, but that takes money.
[02:01:20.333 --> 02:01:22.975]  I'm already trying to give all my employees raises around here.
[02:01:22.995 --> 02:01:24.696]  Oh, okay, I see, I see.
[02:01:25.076 --> 02:01:27.037]  It's all a moolah issue, my friend.
[02:01:27.278 --> 02:01:29.319]  Yeah, I guess the mighty dollar, eh?
[02:01:29.379 --> 02:01:30.360]  The mighty dollar.
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.380]  The all-seeing eye.
[02:01:33.081 --> 02:01:34.082]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:01:34.122 --> 02:01:39.926]  Yeah, we're working like somebody trying to put out 100 fires, basically.
[02:01:41.046 --> 02:01:42.728]  Well, keep up the good work, man.
[02:01:43.348 --> 02:01:43.868]  Thank you.
[02:01:44.148 --> 02:01:44.849]  I appreciate it.
[02:01:45.743 --> 02:01:51.066]  All right, when we get back from break, we will be talking to Joe Byrd.
[02:01:51.926 --> 02:02:00.991]  He didn't get the really horrible treatment that one of his friends got, who works there as an electrical engineer, as an engineer on the government power plants, nuclear power plants, government employee.
[02:02:01.532 --> 02:02:04.433]  Simply out there, got grabbed, got nabbed, got taken to a facility.
[02:02:04.473 --> 02:02:06.875]  They got taken, but not for as long and not as bad.
[02:02:07.995 --> 02:02:09.476]  But they've written it all up in an article.
[02:02:11.312 --> 02:02:14.333]  That they've got on a website they've started for Canada now.
[02:02:14.893 --> 02:02:19.815]  So we'll be telling you about that on the other side.
[02:02:19.835 --> 02:02:32.959]  And we do have a big hour-long synopsis report of up-closes, video of the Queen of the Netherlands and the Rockefellers and all the scum at Bilderberg two and a half weeks ago now, to be technical, to be precise.
[02:02:33.159 --> 02:02:35.960]  And that will be going up on prisonplanet.tv very, very soon.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:41.604]  Alright, on the other side of this quick break, we will get straight into that issue and a lot more.
[02:02:41.925 --> 02:02:42.345]  Stay with us.
[02:02:57.278 --> 02:02:59.160]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:02.003]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:03:02.343 --> 02:03:06.547]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.627 --> 02:03:13.554]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.674 --> 02:03:15.696]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.936 --> 02:03:26.401]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.661 --> 02:03:32.024]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:04:49.817 --> 02:04:51.998]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[02:04:52.498 --> 02:04:57.860]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?

[02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:58.834]  Dave, James, Dan, other callers, we're going to get to your calls.
[02:05:58.854 --> 02:06:01.235]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:06:01.655 --> 02:06:03.356]  It is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:03.416 --> 02:06:06.698]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, here live, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:06:06.898 --> 02:06:10.440]  until 2 p.m., back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:06:11.698 --> 02:06:22.020]  You can go to the new website, truthmovement.ca, truthmovement.ca, and read the immediate press release, Terror Canadian Style.
[02:06:22.935 --> 02:06:23.676]  We're good to go.
[02:06:23.716 --> 02:06:24.176]  We're good to go.
[02:06:42.595 --> 02:06:52.724]  About the recent ultra-secret Bilderberg Summit in Ottawa, where a close friend of mine was taken into custody by Canadian secret police, held without charge in a small chamber and interrogated for six hours.
[02:06:52.824 --> 02:06:54.145]  And they were held even longer than that.
[02:06:54.445 --> 02:06:56.487]  But let me regress and get back to the topic.
[02:06:56.547 --> 02:07:03.613]  Canada's willing participation in the New World Order and specific policies drafted by the Council on Foreign Relations to erase the Canadian and Mexican borders.
[02:07:03.673 --> 02:07:05.334]  And that's Associated Press now, by the way.
[02:07:05.714 --> 02:07:06.475]  That's Lou Dobbs.
[02:07:06.535 --> 02:07:09.958]  I mean, that's mainstream news that we're going into the American Union.
[02:07:09.978 --> 02:07:11.399]  Then he tells the story of what happened.
[02:07:11.934 --> 02:07:12.875]  And he's Joe Bird.
[02:07:13.575 --> 02:07:14.956]  Joe, good to have you on with us.
[02:07:15.496 --> 02:07:17.717]  Alex, it is an absolute pleasure to be here today.
[02:07:17.917 --> 02:07:18.238]  You bet.
[02:07:18.498 --> 02:07:19.839]  You couldn't be on with us last week.
[02:07:19.859 --> 02:07:22.860]  We had your associate who got interrogated, the government employee.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:23.801]  That's right.
[02:07:23.841 --> 02:07:25.062]  Works in nuclear power plants.
[02:07:25.122 --> 02:07:28.824]  But recap what happened to you, what happened to your girlfriend, what happened to him.
[02:07:29.464 --> 02:07:32.986]  Recap what developed, and then tell us about this new organization you launched.
[02:07:33.366 --> 02:07:34.447]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:07:34.507 --> 02:07:37.889]  And once again, I do appreciate the time today to talk about these issues.
[02:07:38.682 --> 02:07:46.065]  As I said, as we've communicated previously in that, we basically went to the Bilderberg.
[02:07:46.866 --> 02:07:54.889]  As you know, we're starting a grassroots organization, TribeCan, here in Canada to support the Truth Movement, so we wanted to jump in headfirst.
[02:07:54.949 --> 02:07:57.730]  We did go to the Bilderberg Summit.
[02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:59.131]  That's where we met up with you.
[02:08:00.450 --> 02:08:07.996]  We spent time seeing what was going on in that, but mostly we were there to support the truth movement and that we know what they're doing.
[02:08:08.596 --> 02:08:09.877]  We know that these people are evil.
[02:08:10.638 --> 02:08:11.959]  We know what their agenda is.
[02:08:12.039 --> 02:08:13.280]  So we wanted to be there.
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:14.281]  We went.
[02:08:14.961 --> 02:08:17.143]  We had, as I said, the honor of meeting you.
[02:08:17.983 --> 02:08:19.604]  And spending time that way and that.
[02:08:20.264 --> 02:08:22.885]  We met your associates, Daniel and Tulan.
[02:08:23.825 --> 02:08:24.365]  Stop it.
[02:08:24.685 --> 02:08:25.165]  Stop it.
[02:08:25.445 --> 02:08:26.586]  I had the honor of meeting you.
[02:08:26.606 --> 02:08:27.106]  Go ahead.
[02:08:27.306 --> 02:08:28.506]  Please, knock it off.
[02:08:29.107 --> 02:08:29.447]  Okay.
[02:08:30.067 --> 02:08:34.548]  Well, basically, that afternoon that we met, Alex, you left at about 1 o'clock.
[02:08:35.169 --> 02:08:40.170]  We stuck around for a little while, and then we decided to go downtown for a bit.
[02:08:40.730 --> 02:08:41.871]  So we went downtown Ottawa.
[02:08:44.058 --> 02:08:52.443]  In which, at that point, myself and Crystal, the girl that was with us at the time, we decided that we were going to go out and have something to eat, have a couple drinks and that.
[02:08:53.543 --> 02:08:57.565]  Don, he was tired, and he decided he wanted to rest.
[02:08:57.645 --> 02:09:00.607]  So in the back of the rental car, he was going to have a nap.
[02:09:01.107 --> 02:09:04.089]  So what had happened is we finished some drinks and that, me and Crystal.
[02:09:04.829 --> 02:09:09.471]  We were going back to where the car was, and this was parked on a side street.
[02:09:11.225 --> 02:09:17.527]  It wasn't out in the open, so I mean, the car itself would have been almost virtually impossible to find.
[02:09:18.388 --> 02:09:23.269]  But what we saw as we were coming around the corner was a barrage of lights.
[02:09:23.429 --> 02:09:27.050]  It was obvious that the police had surrounded the vehicle.
[02:09:27.791 --> 02:09:35.153]  Before we could even go toward the vehicle, myself and Crystal, at the corner that we were at, there was two officers there.
[02:09:36.994 --> 02:09:39.335]  The female officer basically flagged us over.
[02:09:39.735 --> 02:09:40.415]  They knew who we were.
[02:09:41.658 --> 02:09:43.639]  And they told us what was going on.
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:45.180]  They asked us on the spot.
[02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:52.724]  I mean, they kept us there for almost an hour, asking us questions about yourself, also about Don, and so forth.
[02:09:52.864 --> 02:09:54.986]  What specifically did they say about myself?
[02:09:55.046 --> 02:09:56.026]  Then give Don's full name.
[02:09:56.566 --> 02:09:56.807]  Okay.
[02:09:57.967 --> 02:09:59.948]  My friend who I'm referring to is Donald McCormick.
[02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:00.829]  Okay.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:06.061]  And what they were asking about yourself, they were asking about our association with you.
[02:10:06.161 --> 02:10:13.383]  They had obviously realized or saw that we had met with you and such at the actual building.
[02:10:14.564 --> 02:10:17.144]  They wanted to know how many people were in your entourage.
[02:10:17.865 --> 02:10:22.246]  They basically, I mean, they had nothing but negative things to say about you, Alex.
[02:10:24.566 --> 02:10:25.187]  Let me just see.
[02:10:25.207 --> 02:10:25.567]  So, I mean...
[02:10:27.037 --> 02:10:30.058]  Yeah, like, I mean, they wanted to know as much as they could.
[02:10:30.538 --> 02:10:35.801]  They stopped short of calling you an insurgent, but they said that what you do undermines national security.
[02:10:36.641 --> 02:10:39.562]  They had explained to us that you had also been detained at the border and such.
[02:10:40.762 --> 02:10:44.304]  So, I mean, it was those types of questions, basically.
[02:10:45.104 --> 02:10:50.226]  As for Don, they were asking what his intentions were.
[02:10:50.746 --> 02:10:52.027]  They felt that...
[02:10:52.859 --> 02:10:54.640]  He could perhaps be dangerous and such.
[02:10:56.201 --> 02:10:58.062]  That's basically the way that it went.
[02:10:58.102 --> 02:11:02.124]  That was how the questioning was going when we were just originally detained.
[02:11:02.805 --> 02:11:07.167]  What had happened subsequent to that though is that they took Don away.
[02:11:08.088 --> 02:11:12.070]  Once they took Don away, they brought us to a facility in downtown Ottawa
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:19.142]  In which they basically separated Crystal and I. We were separate interrogation rooms.
[02:11:20.142 --> 02:11:23.584]  Again, at that point in time, national security came into the picture.
[02:11:24.364 --> 02:11:30.006]  And they had a lot of the same questions that the original police... These auditors called themselves national security.
[02:11:30.046 --> 02:11:32.127]  Did they say what agency?
[02:11:32.207 --> 02:11:34.928]  They're an offshoot of the RCMP.
[02:11:35.188 --> 02:11:38.589]  However, they're... Royal Mounted Police Anti-Terror Division.
[02:11:38.889 --> 02:11:40.150]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:40.190 --> 02:11:41.210]  That's exactly what it was.
[02:11:42.302 --> 02:11:56.976]  So, while we were there, as I said, Crystal and I... By the way, these are the people that send a bunch of fertilizer to innocent people and then set them up, and then order the media not to report on it.
[02:11:56.996 --> 02:11:59.698]  There's an official order in Canada not to report on the trial.
[02:12:00.459 --> 02:12:03.902]  We have specific legislation in Canada, the Anti-Terrorist Act,
[02:12:04.355 --> 02:12:10.588]  Which actually goes a little bit further than the Patriot Act in that it does state any propaganda.
[02:12:10.928 --> 02:12:13.614]  In other words, if you say anything negative towards the government.
[02:12:14.456 --> 02:12:19.479]  They could construe that as being... Now, see how it starts with, don't say anything about the Holocaust.
[02:12:19.699 --> 02:12:19.899]  Yeah.
[02:12:20.219 --> 02:12:21.800]  Which, again, to some people sounds reasonable.
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:22.940]  It's not reasonable, folks.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:23.961]  We deserve free speech.
[02:12:24.241 --> 02:12:24.381]  Yes.
[02:12:24.461 --> 02:12:28.623]  And then it expands out to, don't say something mean about the government.
[02:12:28.803 --> 02:12:29.083]  Yep.
[02:12:29.323 --> 02:12:30.704]  Have to arrest you for that.
[02:12:31.664 --> 02:12:33.525]  So they've separated you and your girlfriend, Crystal.
[02:12:33.545 --> 02:12:34.106]  What happens next?
[02:12:34.526 --> 02:12:41.069]  Well, basically, at that point, we were asked questions for, I would say, in our cases, it was at least a couple of hours.
[02:12:41.809 --> 02:12:43.150]  So tell me what type of questions.
[02:12:44.342 --> 02:12:47.985]  As I said, they were asking more specifically what we were doing with you.
[02:12:48.746 --> 02:12:53.670]  Again, comments were made that what your actions do is undermine national security.
[02:12:53.690 --> 02:12:55.151]  That was said by two different people.
[02:12:57.173 --> 02:12:59.655]  I'll tell you what, Alex.
[02:12:59.955 --> 02:13:02.237]  They were really interested in you.
[02:13:02.297 --> 02:13:05.019]  You were the celebrity of the moment as far as they were concerned.
[02:13:05.739 --> 02:13:07.601]  They wanted to know anything we could.
[02:13:07.621 --> 02:13:10.443]  There was nothing to tell.
[02:13:10.463 --> 02:13:12.525]  Why didn't these snakes just come talk to me?
[02:13:13.286 --> 02:13:15.187]  You know what?
[02:13:15.247 --> 02:13:15.807]  We're aware.
[02:13:16.127 --> 02:13:17.887]  We know that you got detained when you came in.
[02:13:17.907 --> 02:13:20.788]  I would have said, hey, I'm here to cover these elitists.
[02:13:21.448 --> 02:13:24.969]  Mr. Chalabi, who's in the building right now, is wanted by several of our allies.
[02:13:25.009 --> 02:13:26.410]  He's a convicted bank swindler.
[02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:29.711]  A Nazi war criminal founded this group.
[02:13:29.731 --> 02:13:30.891]  His wife's in there right now.
[02:13:31.891 --> 02:13:36.715]  A bunch of members can't even come here anymore because they're under international indictment like George Soros.
[02:13:37.135 --> 02:13:40.057]  Basically, I'm here to cover an organized crime meeting and you're here protecting them.
[02:13:40.317 --> 02:13:42.338]  You undermine the national security of Canada.
[02:13:42.558 --> 02:13:48.862]  Hey, the very people in this building, Royal Mounted Police Anti-Terror Unit, are trying to get rid of Canadian sovereignty.
[02:13:49.063 --> 02:13:50.944]  Here's the Associated Press and Lou Dobbs.
[02:13:51.844 --> 02:13:52.625]  That's what I'm doing.
[02:13:52.825 --> 02:13:56.047]  I'm here defending your national security, you stupid twits.
[02:13:56.347 --> 02:13:56.548]  Yes.
[02:13:56.928 --> 02:13:57.828]  No, absolutely.
[02:13:58.169 --> 02:14:00.170]  And you know, I'm going to tell you what.
[02:14:00.590 --> 02:14:02.411]  They don't understand the concept.
[02:14:02.431 --> 02:14:07.334]  The people that were interrogating us and such did not understand the concept of what we're talking about.
[02:14:07.374 --> 02:14:08.615]  These are programmed people.
[02:14:08.635 --> 02:14:10.296]  These are people that have been trained.
[02:14:10.336 --> 02:14:11.497]  Well, I mean, go over this for me.
[02:14:11.537 --> 02:14:13.618]  So you brought up what the Bilderberg Group is.
[02:14:13.798 --> 02:14:14.579]  I mean, tell me.
[02:14:14.619 --> 02:14:15.359]  Give me the meat and potatoes.
[02:14:15.379 --> 02:14:15.880]  Well, you know what?
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:20.302]  When we first got there, it was actually the night of the 8th, the first day of the meeting.
[02:14:21.783 --> 02:14:26.886]  Don and I decided to go down to the hotel just to see what was going on over where the Bilderberg was being held.
[02:14:27.727 --> 02:14:29.408]  And when we got there, there was nobody there.
[02:14:29.884 --> 02:14:33.466]  They had kept it, you know, with the exception of what was leaked out on the Internet.
[02:14:34.027 --> 02:14:37.889]  Most mainstream people, the media and such, tried to block it, as you know.
[02:14:38.129 --> 02:14:39.770]  It wasn't in the news until they grabbed me.
[02:14:39.810 --> 02:14:40.591]  That's what broke it.
[02:14:40.631 --> 02:14:41.091]  You know what?
[02:14:41.311 --> 02:14:47.935]  On the 9th, I think, the morning of the 9th that came out in the Ottawa Citizen, that the Bilderberg was there, and that's how come people started to show up on that day.
[02:14:48.516 --> 02:14:52.098]  But, Alex, when we went there that night, we simply walked up to the building.
[02:14:53.373 --> 02:14:55.114]  I mean, this is also a public building.
[02:14:55.154 --> 02:14:56.834]  This is a hotel that people can stay at.
[02:14:56.994 --> 02:15:00.735]  So we had no idea what they told us.
[02:15:00.775 --> 02:15:03.916]  They absolutely said, well, this is private property.
[02:15:04.356 --> 02:15:06.636]  They wanted no part of us.
[02:15:06.756 --> 02:15:10.997]  Now, they also told Donald McCormick that he could be arrested and never be released.
[02:15:11.217 --> 02:15:12.118]  Oh, yeah.
[02:15:12.218 --> 02:15:15.078]  And he was held, I guess, interrogated for six hours.
[02:15:15.098 --> 02:15:15.378]  Oh, yeah.
[02:15:15.398 --> 02:15:18.179]  But he said hold, I believe, a total of almost ten people.
[02:15:19.445 --> 02:15:19.925]  You know what?
[02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:20.285]  Yes.
[02:15:20.645 --> 02:15:24.906]  It was about, between holding and the interrogation, it was about six hours, actually.
[02:15:24.926 --> 02:15:25.586]  Six or seven hours.
[02:15:25.646 --> 02:15:25.786]  Okay.
[02:15:26.307 --> 02:15:27.367]  Then he was wrong about that.
[02:15:27.607 --> 02:15:28.287]  I'm not talking about you.
[02:15:28.307 --> 02:15:28.867]  I'm talking about him.
[02:15:28.907 --> 02:15:30.027]  Wasn't he released after you?
[02:15:31.048 --> 02:15:31.348]  Yes.
[02:15:31.608 --> 02:15:31.808]  Yes.
[02:15:31.888 --> 02:15:35.309]  But even still, in total, it was about maybe seven hours.
[02:15:35.329 --> 02:15:37.749]  What did you think of the questions they asked him?
[02:15:38.189 --> 02:15:38.549]  You know what?
[02:15:38.609 --> 02:15:40.210]  I can get into that right now, Alex.
[02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:44.530]  I know that when you spoke to Don, it was fresh from the incident.
[02:15:45.911 --> 02:15:46.831]  You know, he was scared.
[02:15:47.479 --> 02:15:51.522]  I know that he opened up with you to a certain degree, but I'm going to try to fill in some of the blanks at this point.
[02:15:51.983 --> 02:15:54.645]  When they released Don, he was a mess.
[02:15:54.725 --> 02:15:56.126]  He was completely shaken up.
[02:15:57.527 --> 02:15:58.027]  He babbled.
[02:15:58.327 --> 02:16:00.949]  He basically stayed in the back seat while we drove.
[02:16:00.989 --> 02:16:02.090]  They told us to get out of town.
[02:16:02.130 --> 02:16:07.054]  They told us not to talk to anybody, don't speak to anybody, just leave town and there won't be any problems with what they said.
[02:16:07.094 --> 02:16:08.795]  They didn't want to see us at the building again.
[02:16:09.256 --> 02:16:16.321]  So they basically, for no apparent reason, restricted our ability to even go and even protest and exercise our free speech.
[02:16:17.085 --> 02:16:21.529]  But what he was babbling, what he was talking about is some of the threats that they were making.
[02:16:22.049 --> 02:16:24.831]  As outlandish as it sounds, I'm going to tell you something.
[02:16:25.071 --> 02:16:31.216]  He said, not only did he tell me and Crystal that night, but I'm going to tell you about what happened after.
[02:16:31.297 --> 02:16:34.099]  But they had at one point said, you know what, we can cut your arms off.
[02:16:34.179 --> 02:16:35.480]  We can do anything we want to you.
[02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:37.851]  This is what they told him, and this is what he told us.
[02:16:37.891 --> 02:16:42.092]  I know, he was totally freaked out, and he said he wouldn't talk about the violence threats.
[02:16:42.792 --> 02:16:44.772]  So he told you they threatened to cut his arms off?
[02:16:44.833 --> 02:16:54.955]  Oh yes, but not only did he tell us that, when we got back on the 10th, when we got back to where we are and such, he basically had somewhat of a breakdown.
[02:16:55.716 --> 02:16:57.056]  I don't like to use that term.
[02:16:57.631 --> 02:16:59.612]  But he basically collapsed.
[02:16:59.652 --> 02:17:00.992]  We had to take him into the hospital.
[02:17:01.192 --> 02:17:01.832]  He was in tears.
[02:17:01.872 --> 02:17:02.432]  He was a mess.
[02:17:02.692 --> 02:17:03.993]  Is that on the record?
[02:17:04.373 --> 02:17:07.794]  This is an international incident.
[02:17:08.034 --> 02:17:08.234]  Yes.
[02:17:08.654 --> 02:17:10.495]  So they threatened to cut his arms off.
[02:17:10.735 --> 02:17:12.615]  What other threats did he tell you they made to him?
[02:17:13.155 --> 02:17:16.456]  They basically told him that they're going to be watching him.
[02:17:17.257 --> 02:17:22.038]  One of the things that he had said that night is that they told him he would never be alone again.
[02:17:22.822 --> 02:17:23.062]  Okay.
[02:17:23.442 --> 02:17:27.264]  This is a person, Don is a person now that looks over his shoulder.
[02:17:27.424 --> 02:17:31.505]  See, I'd have told that scum, I'd have told that scum, go ahead and cut my arms off.
[02:17:32.526 --> 02:17:35.187]  And I told him he was in danger of being flown out of the country.
[02:17:35.627 --> 02:17:36.547]  I tell you what, stay there.
[02:17:36.887 --> 02:17:41.669]  One heartbeat away, Alex, from being flown to Eastern Europe and being put in one of those secret... I know, I know.
[02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:42.510]  Stay there, stay there.
[02:17:42.650 --> 02:17:43.190]  We'll be right back.

[02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:22.681]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[02:18:22.722 --> 02:18:29.986]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[02:18:30.346 --> 02:18:33.848]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[02:18:51.101 --> 02:18:54.343]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:18:55.083 --> 02:18:59.086]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.342 --> 02:19:08.463]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:08.744 --> 02:19:13.646]  The bank paid you 1%, your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:14.186 --> 02:19:16.407]  Here is reality.
[02:19:16.787 --> 02:19:20.369]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:20.849 --> 02:19:24.511]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:25.071 --> 02:19:27.592]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:29.252 --> 02:19:29.693]  We're good to go.
[02:19:45.367 --> 02:19:48.630]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:19:48.690 --> 02:19:52.894]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:19:53.134 --> 02:19:55.916]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:19:56.096 --> 02:19:58.498]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:19:58.699 --> 02:20:07.346]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:20:07.526 --> 02:20:08.887]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:20:09.087 --> 02:20:13.251]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:20:13.491 --> 02:20:13.991]  We're good to go.
[02:20:32.577 --> 02:20:35.261]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:20:46.491 --> 02:20:49.073]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:20:49.233 --> 02:20:51.395]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:20:51.675 --> 02:21:01.763]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?

[02:21:35.949 --> 02:21:37.170]  Up on Infowars.com, we have a link to this article.
[02:21:58.988 --> 02:22:05.051]  Press release put out by this organization, TruthMovement.ca.
[02:22:06.052 --> 02:22:07.812]  And we need to get the documents posted, too.
[02:22:07.832 --> 02:22:09.934]  You need to get it on record that you took him to the hospital.
[02:22:10.634 --> 02:22:11.654]  On record, all this happened.
[02:22:11.674 --> 02:22:13.795]  So they threatened to cut his arms off.
[02:22:14.436 --> 02:22:16.217]  He was telling you this babbling in fear.
[02:22:17.077 --> 02:22:18.778]  That's classic how they terrorize people.
[02:22:18.818 --> 02:22:20.539]  Did he tell you anything else they threatened?
[02:22:20.559 --> 02:22:22.240]  I mean, on air, he said he wouldn't talk about some of it.
[02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:23.100]  You know what?
[02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:28.643]  What they said is they basically clarified to him, Alex, that they knew everything about him.
[02:22:29.607 --> 02:22:37.772]  Before they picked him up, they must have did their homework, because when they picked him up, they seemed to know every detail about his life over the last two decades.
[02:22:37.812 --> 02:22:40.374]  Well, of course, he works at a nuclear power plant.
[02:22:40.514 --> 02:22:41.294]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:22:42.155 --> 02:22:47.238]  I do want to point out one thing as well with Don, as well as Crystal and I.
[02:22:47.802 --> 02:22:49.283]  We have no criminal records.
[02:22:50.304 --> 02:22:56.668]  Beyond their reasoning for picking him up that day, there was no other reasoning that they could possibly have had.
[02:22:56.688 --> 02:22:57.708]  Okay?
[02:22:57.968 --> 02:23:00.110]  So that's something that needs to be clear as well.
[02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:04.713]  Yeah, this is a person that I'll tell you right now, he was terrorized.
[02:23:04.993 --> 02:23:10.156]  The government, these are the people that are saying they're here to keep us safe, but really, they're taking people aside.
[02:23:10.196 --> 02:23:12.037]  They're doing these things to their own benefit.
[02:23:12.057 --> 02:23:13.678]  Well, he needs to file a criminal...
[02:23:15.555 --> 02:23:16.016]  Filing.
[02:23:16.056 --> 02:23:20.880]  I mean, if on record he will testify that they threatened to cut his arms off, they should all go to jail.
[02:23:21.181 --> 02:23:23.883]  That is psychological torture by every yardstick.
[02:23:24.083 --> 02:23:25.124]  That's what torture is.
[02:23:25.325 --> 02:23:27.767]  Answer my questions or I'm going to start cutting your fingers off.
[02:23:28.007 --> 02:23:29.449]  Then I'm going to cut your arms off.
[02:23:30.430 --> 02:23:32.031]  Well, obviously it was psychological.
[02:23:32.071 --> 02:23:39.038]  By the way, it's funny you just said that because that's exactly what's in the torture manuals is threatened dismemberment.
[02:23:39.645 --> 02:23:40.186]  Well, you know what?
[02:23:40.446 --> 02:23:43.991]  They read that manual then, Alex, because they knew all about it.
[02:23:44.331 --> 02:23:46.293]  What else was he babbling?
[02:23:47.355 --> 02:23:48.937]  You know, basically that he was scared.
[02:23:49.417 --> 02:23:51.059]  They had threatened the people around him.
[02:23:51.140 --> 02:23:58.349]  He said that he was very scared for Crystal and I. What they had conveyed to him is we have Joe and Crystal as well.
[02:23:58.829 --> 02:23:59.149]  Okay.
[02:23:59.570 --> 02:24:01.492]  They gave me... I want to stop right there.
[02:24:02.152 --> 02:24:03.573]  We can take you out of the country.
[02:24:03.593 --> 02:24:04.795]  You can never be seen again.
[02:24:04.855 --> 02:24:06.076]  You can never be released again.
[02:24:06.276 --> 02:24:07.277]  We've got your friends.
[02:24:07.297 --> 02:24:08.678]  We can cut your arms off.
[02:24:08.858 --> 02:24:09.018]  Yep.
[02:24:09.319 --> 02:24:10.700]  Sounds like the good guys to me.
[02:24:11.420 --> 02:24:12.461]  You know what?
[02:24:12.501 --> 02:24:14.223]  They don't sound like good guys to me either, Alex.
[02:24:14.924 --> 02:24:16.385]  I can agree with that 100%.
[02:24:17.406 --> 02:24:20.369]  You know, so, as I said, we took him home.
[02:24:21.089 --> 02:24:21.890]  He wasn't himself.
[02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.591]  I mean, he...
[02:24:23.499 --> 02:24:26.921]  He just was not the same person that I've known for over two decades.
[02:24:26.941 --> 02:24:31.684]  Now, you know, did you see my article days after about the provocateurs in the crowd?
[02:24:31.704 --> 02:24:32.144]  Absolutely, yes.
[02:24:32.164 --> 02:24:35.045]  They were trying to get me to say one thing, and we wrote this in the article.
[02:24:35.386 --> 02:24:39.248]  I would have been instantly grabbed and in there, and they might have been cutting fingers off, whatever.
[02:24:39.548 --> 02:24:40.528]  And I'd never be seen again.
[02:24:40.609 --> 02:24:41.529]  Alex Jones gone.
[02:24:41.769 --> 02:24:42.530]  You know what, Alex?
[02:24:42.690 --> 02:24:49.133]  I'm telling you right now that if they had a reason that they could do that with you, the fortunate thing with you is that you are in the public eye.
[02:24:49.774 --> 02:24:50.054]  Okay?
[02:24:50.074 --> 02:24:52.135]  Because I'll tell you, if they did this to Don...
[02:24:53.148 --> 02:24:57.330]  Given the opportunity, they'd do worse to you because you are the champion of the truth.
[02:24:57.870 --> 02:25:01.132]  I mean, you're out there every single day opening people's eyes.
[02:25:01.612 --> 02:25:02.913]  Well, I want to just tell them this.
[02:25:03.113 --> 02:25:06.814]  You know, they do something like that, the universe will turn against them.
[02:25:07.114 --> 02:25:09.575]  And the more evil they do, we don't have to do anything to them.
[02:25:09.635 --> 02:25:10.716]  God's going to deal with them.
[02:25:11.345 --> 02:25:11.845]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:25:11.905 --> 02:25:12.446]  I appreciate that.
[02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:30.360]  They want to go up against the God of the universe?
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:31.261]  Let them do it.
[02:25:31.741 --> 02:25:33.322]  Well, you know what this shows, Alex?
[02:25:34.023 --> 02:25:40.026]  It's a little bit beyond Bilderberg, and that is Canada plays a very significant role in the New World Order's agenda.
[02:25:40.327 --> 02:25:48.572]  That's something that, as the truth movement has proliferated over the last decade and such, it's really been centralized in the United States.
[02:25:48.712 --> 02:25:50.613]  But the globalists have a plan for North America.
[02:25:50.653 --> 02:25:53.535]  As you said, as Lou Dobbs has said, they want to erase the borders.
[02:25:54.228 --> 02:25:55.328]  Did you ever bring that up?
[02:25:55.368 --> 02:26:01.190]  Now, I mean, when they were interrogating you, they weren't anywhere as vicious as they were with Donald McCormick.
[02:26:01.210 --> 02:26:02.210]  What else did they say to you?
[02:26:03.091 --> 02:26:03.491]  You know what?
[02:26:03.571 --> 02:26:08.912]  I brought up actually a lot of the facts and such that you would promote, that the truth movement promotes.
[02:26:09.612 --> 02:26:11.933]  And basically, they brushed it off.
[02:26:12.573 --> 02:26:15.594]  They outright said they denied smart borders.
[02:26:15.834 --> 02:26:18.035]  They basically said that it's not true.
[02:26:18.075 --> 02:26:19.155]  There is no police state.
[02:26:20.117 --> 02:26:21.998]  They are there to keep us safe.
[02:26:22.339 --> 02:26:25.642]  We're just here threatening to cut arms off, but we're good.
[02:26:25.842 --> 02:26:26.283]  Exactly.
[02:26:26.303 --> 02:26:27.064]  There's no police there.
[02:26:27.084 --> 02:26:33.190]  They're the government, Alex, so that's probably what gives them what they think that they have the right.
[02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:36.273]  I don't know what it is, but I think that's pretty ghoulish.
[02:26:37.607 --> 02:26:38.727]  To threaten somebody with.
[02:26:38.988 --> 02:26:47.473]  Hey, folks, when John Yoo, as a White House counsel, gets up at the CFR and says, yes, we're allowed to torture children in front of their parents, that's why that freaks me out.
[02:26:47.513 --> 02:26:50.015]  I mean, that shows this is not a joke, people.
[02:26:50.275 --> 02:26:50.715]  No, it's not.
[02:26:50.736 --> 02:26:51.896]  And I'm going to tell you something, too.
[02:26:51.956 --> 02:26:54.958]  Now that Stephen Harper is the prime minister of this country, that is,
[02:26:56.179 --> 02:26:57.940]  You're going to see some big, big changes.
[02:26:58.741 --> 02:27:03.103]  The actual alignment with what's going on in the United States... Has accelerated.
[02:27:03.843 --> 02:27:06.125]  It's accelerated by tenfold at this point.
[02:27:06.845 --> 02:27:10.147]  This is a person that has been involved with every right wing...
[02:27:11.112 --> 02:27:12.853]  Hey, I've got your article right here.
[02:27:12.893 --> 02:27:15.655]  Does it have all the threatening to cut the arms off in it and stuff?
[02:27:15.715 --> 02:27:16.055]  I do.
[02:27:16.075 --> 02:27:16.415]  It does.
[02:27:16.435 --> 02:27:16.776]  You know what?
[02:27:17.076 --> 02:27:20.858]  If anybody reads that article, by all means, they're going to get the full story.
[02:27:20.878 --> 02:27:21.719]  They're going to see a lot of stuff.
[02:27:21.759 --> 02:27:25.601]  I mean, another thing that we could talk about is the nuclear industry in Canada.
[02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:27.122]  Okay, we talk about North Korea.
[02:27:27.162 --> 02:27:31.144]  We talk about our... Hey, I'm going to give you a few minutes on the other side because I've got to finish up some news and take some calls.
[02:27:31.504 --> 02:27:32.205]  But stay there.
[02:27:32.305 --> 02:27:32.965]  Stay there, Don.
[02:27:33.305 --> 02:27:34.066]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:34.346 --> 02:27:35.147]  Stay there.
[02:27:36.107 --> 02:27:37.008]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.488 --> 02:27:39.009]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.001 --> 02:27:42.702]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:01.332 --> 02:28:01.833]  We're good to go.
[02:28:19.833 --> 02:28:25.198]  The widely researched natural herbal supplement for regulating blood pressure and maintaining optimum heart health.
[02:28:25.518 --> 02:28:31.583]  Did you know that the safety and effectiveness of heart care is backed by over 100 clinical trials and experimental studies?

[02:28:45.695 --> 02:28:47.676]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:47.756 --> 02:28:58.459]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.839 --> 02:29:03.360]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:14.763]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.343 --> 02:29:22.209]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.589 --> 02:29:24.731]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.231 --> 02:29:30.215]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:30:21.322 --> 02:30:21.702]  We're good to go.
[02:30:45.703 --> 02:30:51.767]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:53.208 --> 02:30:55.089]  We're going to finish up this horrible story.
[02:30:55.109 --> 02:30:59.231]  We kind of dropped the ball last week when Donald McCormick was on and told his story.
[02:30:59.251 --> 02:31:00.392]  We didn't write an article about it.
[02:31:00.432 --> 02:31:01.312]  Now we've got to.
[02:31:01.332 --> 02:31:07.116]  Thank goodness that there's a press release put out by truthmovement.ca.
[02:31:07.156 --> 02:31:12.019]  We have links to it up on infowars.com, so you can link over to it and get the story, get it out to everyone.
[02:31:13.221 --> 02:31:18.766]  I mean, this is scary at a certain level, but it's more scary not to speak up, not to get involved, not to say no to this.
[02:31:18.806 --> 02:31:24.391]  Before I go back to Joe Byrd, that this happened to, along with Donald McCormick.
[02:31:25.399 --> 02:31:32.124]  I want to just remind you that New Millennium Concepts is our biggest sponsor, and they have the Made in America black Berkey system.
[02:31:32.144 --> 02:31:33.805]  They also have the British Berkeys, if you'd like that.
[02:31:33.845 --> 02:31:37.348]  They have American and British that are in stainless steel with the black elements.
[02:31:37.508 --> 02:31:38.449]  I recommend the American.
[02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.050]  It's even a better, higher standard.
[02:31:40.410 --> 02:31:46.855]  Major University Studies, they have a bunch of specials right now where you get a $199 unit that's normally $300 at a store.
[02:31:46.875 --> 02:31:49.297]  You get it at wholesale prices, okay?
[02:31:50.177 --> 02:31:52.919]  I mean, if I buy a bunch of these in bulk, I might get them down to about $175.
[02:31:52.959 --> 02:32:00.586]  I mean, to give you an idea of how cheap they sell these, you get an individual unit, you get it at or right above wholesale, okay, for buying a single unit.
[02:32:00.826 --> 02:32:10.615]  Then you get a free $30 sports bottle that cleans your water you can take with you or a sheltering in place DVD or a bunch of other items that they've got that you absolutely need.
[02:32:10.635 --> 02:32:17.721]  They've got little solar panels that plug into the lighting system that comes on these that will then charge cell phones and other systems.
[02:32:18.201 --> 02:32:20.442]  You really need to call and get this.
[02:32:20.482 --> 02:32:21.802]  The water is full of poison.
[02:32:21.822 --> 02:32:24.262]  These globalists are poisoning us through the water.
[02:32:24.342 --> 02:32:25.643]  It's absolutely documented.
[02:32:25.723 --> 02:32:26.663]  Research it for yourself.
[02:32:27.123 --> 02:32:30.404]  Give New Millennium Concepts a call right now and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:32:30.424 --> 02:32:34.164]  You want to know about the five different Alex Jones specials that are available.
[02:32:34.184 --> 02:32:34.324]  1-888-803-4438 1-888-803-4438
[02:32:42.839 --> 02:32:43.859]  Call and Debbie will answer.
[02:32:43.899 --> 02:32:45.080]  If she doesn't, leave your name and number.
[02:32:45.100 --> 02:32:47.441]  She'll call you or one of her associates will call you right back.
[02:32:47.741 --> 02:32:52.923]  You can also call and get a free brochure.
[02:32:52.943 --> 02:32:59.205]  1-888-803-4438 or go to BerkeyWater.com and look at all of the different deals and specials and items and products that they have.
[02:32:59.225 --> 02:33:05.307]  You can put in the comments section what free gift you want when you order via their safe, secure shopping cart or go to InfoWars.com.
[02:33:05.607 --> 02:33:07.428]  All the exact same products and free gifts.
[02:33:07.808 --> 02:33:08.528]  Right there on the site.
[02:33:08.548 --> 02:33:15.991]  Just tell us again in the comment section what free gift you want at InfoWars.com or link through on their banner to BerkeyWater.com and get it right there.
[02:33:16.051 --> 02:33:16.791]  Again, that number.
[02:33:17.252 --> 02:33:18.832]  And you also support this broadcast.
[02:33:18.852 --> 02:33:19.652]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:33:19.953 --> 02:33:22.033]  Alright.
[02:33:24.454 --> 02:33:27.875]  Going back here, just briefly finishing up with Joe Bird.
[02:33:27.936 --> 02:33:29.956]  Joe, you've got to file criminal complaints.
[02:33:30.296 --> 02:33:31.117]  You know what, Alex?
[02:33:31.197 --> 02:33:33.297]  That's something that we are talking about right now.
[02:33:33.798 --> 02:33:34.538]  As you can imagine...
[02:33:35.114 --> 02:33:40.157]  I know Donald says he's talking to a lawyer, and his lawyer told him not to talk, but go ahead.
[02:33:40.597 --> 02:33:55.666]  Well, that's the thing, and even beyond that, because of who the adversary is in this case, who the criminal is in this case, which is our government, he's been hesitant because he fears what the repercussions could be.
[02:33:55.686 --> 02:33:57.087]  What was the facility like?
[02:33:57.728 --> 02:33:58.108]  You know what?
[02:33:58.388 --> 02:34:02.911]  We're not certain that we were held in the same facility as Donald.
[02:34:03.487 --> 02:34:03.767]  Okay.
[02:34:04.508 --> 02:34:09.932]  We were taken, I would say it was about a 10 to 15 minute drive from the main downtown core.
[02:34:10.692 --> 02:34:13.855]  On the outside, we weren't taken in underground like Don.
[02:34:14.155 --> 02:34:14.475]  Okay?
[02:34:14.555 --> 02:34:16.336]  And we didn't see Don at the facility.
[02:34:16.737 --> 02:34:19.018]  So that's why we're not certain we were at the same place.
[02:34:19.078 --> 02:34:26.303]  Where we went was an RCMP facility where the National Security Enforcement Team is headquartered.
[02:34:27.224 --> 02:34:27.544]  Okay?
[02:34:27.644 --> 02:34:32.388]  So, I mean, it was, you know, it was a bit more elaborate than a police station.
[02:34:33.138 --> 02:34:37.922]  We didn't really see much of it besides the very small interrogation rooms that we were in.
[02:34:38.783 --> 02:34:42.806]  Were you in the big metal door cells that Donald McCormick was in?
[02:34:43.306 --> 02:34:46.569]  We were in locked rooms.
[02:34:46.629 --> 02:34:49.171]  I don't think that it was the same type of cell that Donald was in.
[02:34:49.191 --> 02:34:51.893]  Yeah, he said these were like maximum security, huge metal doors.
[02:34:52.034 --> 02:34:55.016]  Yes, I don't believe that that was in our case.
[02:34:55.216 --> 02:34:59.780]  Where we were, they were locked rooms, they were secure rooms, it was a secure facility without question.
[02:35:00.687 --> 02:35:08.353]  But, again, I don't think that we were put in the same type of a chamber as what Don... And he said it wasn't a 15-minute ride to where he went.
[02:35:09.562 --> 02:35:11.384]  Yeah, you know what, that's what I'm saying.
[02:35:11.644 --> 02:35:17.290]  It's conceivable that they took him to the same building, but it would have been... Well, you might have been upstairs and he was down under it.
[02:35:17.631 --> 02:35:18.091]  Pretty much.
[02:35:18.491 --> 02:35:24.277]  That would be... I mean, he described a big building and going under a parking garage underground.
[02:35:24.317 --> 02:35:25.459]  Were you taken to a big building?
[02:35:25.779 --> 02:35:25.999]  Yes.
[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:26.880]  Okay.
[02:35:26.940 --> 02:35:32.286]  Yeah, that's true, except we went in escorted by officers through the front door, is what...
[02:35:32.956 --> 02:35:33.938]  What our experience was.
[02:35:34.038 --> 02:35:39.987]  No, without any question, Alex, Don's experience was horrendous compared to what we went through.
[02:35:40.007 --> 02:35:41.309]  All right, real quick, because I've got to move on.
[02:35:41.329 --> 02:35:42.251]  I want to get you back on.
[02:35:42.531 --> 02:35:43.292]  What else developed?
[02:35:43.312 --> 02:35:44.254]  Anything else we need to know about?
[02:35:45.704 --> 02:35:46.824]  Beyond Bilderberg?
[02:35:47.164 --> 02:35:49.425]  Well, no, I'll have to have you back on sometime about that.
[02:35:49.605 --> 02:35:54.787]  But you guys need to file a complaint publicly, and Don needs to know.
[02:35:54.827 --> 02:35:55.847]  That's what will make him safe.
[02:35:56.147 --> 02:35:57.187]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[02:35:57.687 --> 02:35:59.548]  As I said, we are talking about that.
[02:35:59.648 --> 02:36:01.408]  We do have our new organization now.
[02:36:01.568 --> 02:36:03.289]  We're very grassroots, Alex, at this point.
[02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:05.789]  We just want to get the message out at this time.
[02:36:05.909 --> 02:36:07.670]  We just want to let people know what's happening.
[02:36:08.466 --> 02:36:21.055]  The website that you've mentioned and such, truthmovement.ca, right now it's basically we're working on the content and that within the next couple of days it's going to be in full force.
[02:36:21.295 --> 02:36:23.176]  After it's developed, we'll have you on more.
[02:36:23.236 --> 02:36:24.257]  Thank you for your courage.
[02:36:24.577 --> 02:36:25.758]  I appreciate you coming on, Joe.
[02:36:26.018 --> 02:36:26.618]  Not a problem, Alex.
[02:36:26.638 --> 02:36:27.239]  You have a great day.
[02:36:28.119 --> 02:36:28.620]  God bless you.
[02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:29.460]  We're going to get him back on.
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:33.083]  We're going to write a big article on this and their allegations that they've made.
[02:36:33.103 --> 02:36:38.247]  We're going to make phone calls up there to these individuals and demand a statement on the record.
[02:36:39.048 --> 02:36:39.508]  Incredible.
[02:36:39.808 --> 02:36:42.411]  Look, I know we have Dave and James and Dan.
[02:36:42.471 --> 02:36:44.012]  I will get to at least those three calls.
[02:36:44.532 --> 02:36:45.993]  But right now, I promise to air it.
[02:36:46.033 --> 02:36:50.555]  It's seven minutes long, and we'll take calls in the final eight minutes or so that we have left after that.
[02:36:50.835 --> 02:36:57.537]  Here's Charlie Sheen with his comments, introducing myself at the conference in Los Angeles on Saturday.
[02:36:57.857 --> 02:36:58.838]  Incredible courage.
[02:36:58.858 --> 02:36:59.278]  Here it is.
[02:36:59.998 --> 02:37:03.300]  Presenting our next speaker is a man who needs no introduction.
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:11.383]  His recent courageous radio and television interviews have sparked a worldwide momentum in favor of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:37:13.064 --> 02:37:18.567]  He is the star of over 100 major motion pictures, including Wall Street, Red Dawn, and Platoon.
[02:37:19.107 --> 02:37:22.449]  Currently, you can see him on CBS's Two and a Half Men.
[02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:26.572]  Ladies and gentlemen, the indestructible Charlie Sheen!
[02:37:46.578 --> 02:37:47.418]  Thank you.
[02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:51.380]  Thank you all.
[02:37:53.921 --> 02:37:54.802]  That is so moving.
[02:37:55.122 --> 02:37:55.462]  Thank you.
[02:37:55.862 --> 02:37:57.483]  Thank you all for coming.
[02:37:59.044 --> 02:38:00.825]  Good evening.
[02:38:01.285 --> 02:38:08.948]  Everybody's making a big deal about what I did.
[02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:12.450]  I just felt like I was pursuing the truth.
[02:38:13.551 --> 02:38:14.031]  That's all.
[02:38:20.675 --> 02:38:25.158]  But I want to talk about what we're doing today, more specifically.
[02:38:27.779 --> 02:38:31.782]  We are here today to effect a change.
[02:38:34.644 --> 02:38:39.867]  We are here today to ask those still sleeping to wake up and join us.
[02:38:48.303 --> 02:38:55.605]  We are here today to present a case forged in science at the bedrock and common sense in its foundation.
[02:38:57.366 --> 02:39:08.329]  We are here today to fire a warning shot across the bow of mainstream media to remind them of their original responsibility as civil and political watchdogs.
[02:39:16.054 --> 02:39:21.396]  We are here today because fear is never a good enough reason to do nothing.
[02:39:25.797 --> 02:39:30.878]  We are here today to fuel the deconstruction of the official myth.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:42.742]  We are here today to hold our course, to bang our drones, to sharpen our focus.
[02:39:46.188 --> 02:39:50.390]  We are also here today to exercise our right to assemble.
[02:39:59.134 --> 02:40:00.494]  Our right to speak freely.
[02:40:05.476 --> 02:40:06.477]  And our right to choose.
[02:40:10.373 --> 02:40:17.778]  We are here today to begin draining the cesspool of lies and distortion we refuse to drown in any longer.
[02:40:17.798 --> 02:40:29.825]  We are here today to unleash a juggernaut of truth.
[02:40:36.689 --> 02:40:37.790]  We are also here today
[02:40:39.532 --> 02:40:42.914]  To honor the victims and the families of 9-11.
[02:40:42.934 --> 02:40:53.219]  We're here today for our children.
[02:40:54.060 --> 02:40:58.482]  As well as their children.
[02:41:07.069 --> 02:41:16.414]  In our country's great history, every seminal movement, every groundbreaking event, every pioneering moment began with one person.
[02:41:18.575 --> 02:41:19.475]  A person with a vision.
[02:41:20.536 --> 02:41:22.276]  A person with an undying passion.
[02:41:22.797 --> 02:41:26.258]  A person who could not and would not do nothing.
[02:41:27.419 --> 02:41:35.623]  A person who risked everything to stand naked in the eye of the storm, in the mouth of the beast, in the crosshairs of oppression.
[02:41:37.368 --> 02:41:41.190]  We are blessed to have such a person with us today.
[02:41:41.210 --> 02:41:48.052]  A true patriot, a real American, a genuine hero.
[02:41:50.293 --> 02:41:54.155]  It is with great honor that I introduce our next speaker.
[02:41:54.215 --> 02:41:58.836]  Please join me in welcoming my friend, my comrade, my brother in arms.
[02:41:59.637 --> 02:42:02.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only, Alex Jones!
[02:42:19.775 --> 02:42:27.897]  What's it like to see all these energized people?
[02:42:27.917 --> 02:42:32.598]  I mean, this is your idea, really, originally, to have a truth convergence here in Los Angeles.
[02:42:32.919 --> 02:42:33.999]  What do you think of this?
[02:42:35.237 --> 02:42:38.739]  This is real, and this is inspiring.
[02:42:39.539 --> 02:42:41.700]  I'm inspired by your speech, John.
[02:42:43.021 --> 02:42:44.862]  Lastly, what was it like when you took that plunge?
[02:42:44.882 --> 02:42:45.683]  Because we talked about it.
[02:42:45.723 --> 02:42:46.723]  I mean, Charlie knew what he was doing.
[02:42:47.223 --> 02:42:48.364]  He's not a stupid guy.
[02:42:48.384 --> 02:42:48.824]  He's smart.
[02:42:49.104 --> 02:42:50.985]  What was it like when you took that plunge?
[02:42:51.005 --> 02:42:53.607]  When you decided to go public and speak out?
[02:42:53.807 --> 02:42:59.169]  When everybody else in Hollywood seemed to know what was going on, they didn't have the will that you had, the courage.
[02:42:59.209 --> 02:42:59.790]  How did you do that?
[02:43:02.493 --> 02:43:04.855]  I just got tired of listening to the lies.
[02:43:05.416 --> 02:43:10.560]  I knew it was time to do something, but specifically that plunge was like...
[02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:13.320]  I guess jumping out of an airplane.
[02:43:14.181 --> 02:43:16.421]  I'm not knowing if I had a parachute.
[02:43:17.262 --> 02:43:19.582]  Well, Charlie Sheen, I want to thank you for being here.
[02:43:19.602 --> 02:43:20.803]  I want to thank the crowd for being here.
[02:43:20.823 --> 02:43:23.524]  And I'm just honored to have you here with us.
[02:43:23.564 --> 02:43:25.324]  There's no way to top what you said.
[02:43:26.324 --> 02:43:28.345]  It was like Shakespeare sometimes.
[02:43:28.465 --> 02:43:29.345]  No, it wasn't.
[02:43:29.405 --> 02:43:30.166]  Come on.
[02:43:30.246 --> 02:43:31.886]  Charlie, thank you so much for being here.
[02:43:32.886 --> 02:43:33.647]  Thank you.
[02:43:47.899 --> 02:43:48.300]  All right.
[02:43:48.942 --> 02:43:53.533]  Now, the first video we put up encoded wrong, so it wasn't the best quality.
[02:43:53.553 --> 02:43:55.278]  We put a better quality video.
[02:43:56.139 --> 02:43:59.801]  Clip and group of camera shots of that up on, I think it's a riveting video.
[02:43:59.821 --> 02:44:00.561]  You should go watch it.
[02:44:01.402 --> 02:44:02.622]  Charlie Sheen is such a good guy.
[02:44:03.383 --> 02:44:05.584]  Lord knows what will happen to him now if he's done this.
[02:44:06.584 --> 02:44:07.465]  He's waiting for that.
[02:44:07.525 --> 02:44:10.126]  I'm sure they'll say something even more horrible about him.
[02:44:10.146 --> 02:44:10.787]  But that's courage.
[02:44:12.527 --> 02:44:16.129]  He really, the things he said about me, I think reflect even more on him.
[02:44:16.149 --> 02:44:21.512]  I'm just so honored to work with somebody like this and to have him come forward and do what he did.
[02:44:22.677 --> 02:44:24.338]  But help us.
[02:44:24.418 --> 02:44:25.739]  Go to Infowars.com.
[02:44:25.779 --> 02:44:26.960]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:28.421]  Get the video.
[02:44:28.541 --> 02:44:29.721]  Put it on every message board.
[02:44:29.802 --> 02:44:30.622]  Email it out to everybody.
[02:44:30.662 --> 02:44:33.024]  Make sure people see this because it's important.
[02:44:33.044 --> 02:44:41.349]  And all the other clips and video pieces, we're going to be putting up on Google Video and YouTube in the next few days.
[02:44:42.589 --> 02:44:44.871]  YouTube is only 10-minute long clips.
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:48.341]  And Google can be a couple hours long.
[02:44:48.381 --> 02:44:52.242]  We're going to try to utilize that because, frankly, we just can't afford to give it all out for free.
[02:44:52.322 --> 02:44:53.242]  It just costs too much.
[02:44:53.763 --> 02:44:56.323]  So we're doing that here feverishly right now to get this out to everybody.
[02:44:56.363 --> 02:44:57.644]  And then we'll do the work.
[02:44:57.664 --> 02:45:03.506]  Then it's up to you to take it the final step, the final base into home plate and get it out to everybody.
[02:45:03.546 --> 02:45:10.828]  So please help us again to do that so people can see this powerful video, the clip you just heard, and all the other clips we've already put up there.
[02:45:11.268 --> 02:45:11.648]  All right.
[02:45:11.948 --> 02:45:13.389]  Right now, let's go ahead and...
[02:45:14.366 --> 02:45:15.527]  Take a call.
[02:45:16.227 --> 02:45:17.628]  Let's talk to Dave in California.
[02:45:17.648 --> 02:45:19.009]  Dave, thanks for holding it on the air.
[02:45:19.409 --> 02:45:20.029]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:45:20.069 --> 02:45:21.090]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:45:21.850 --> 02:45:24.892]  That speech is so moving and so well-deserved.
[02:45:25.192 --> 02:45:32.597]  And, Mr. Sheen, I'm going to watch every one of your movies from here on out twice, even if I don't like them.
[02:45:33.057 --> 02:45:36.799]  I wanted to ask you what the little side comment about Shakespeare was.
[02:45:36.979 --> 02:45:38.080]  It was an inside joke, I guess.
[02:45:39.048 --> 02:45:40.969]  No, I said your words.
[02:45:41.089 --> 02:45:42.609]  It sounded like Shakespeare.
[02:45:44.669 --> 02:45:47.970]  His words were very well put together, very literary.
[02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:49.391]  It was good.
[02:45:49.651 --> 02:45:52.191]  Yeah, and so was your speech before the Bilderbergs.
[02:45:52.911 --> 02:45:56.272]  I kept that up on my desktop for days, watching it over and over.
[02:45:56.292 --> 02:45:57.172]  This is great.
[02:45:57.773 --> 02:45:59.013]  Okay, so off that subject.
[02:45:59.473 --> 02:46:01.354]  I finally figured out something that I can do.
[02:46:01.374 --> 02:46:04.754]  It's been a long process for me to do it, but here's my plan.
[02:46:05.034 --> 02:46:07.255]  First thing I'm going to do is make three phone calls today.
[02:46:07.771 --> 02:46:09.372]  I'm going to call Calbin and get some of their soap.
[02:46:09.732 --> 02:46:14.115]  I'm going to call your office and get the all-in-one special.
[02:46:14.375 --> 02:46:18.638]  And I'm going to call Ted Anderson and become a subscriber to GCN.
[02:46:18.678 --> 02:46:21.960]  So maybe you can afford a little bit more of the raise money.
[02:46:22.260 --> 02:46:23.201]  You guys all deserve it.
[02:46:23.521 --> 02:46:24.442]  Well, thank you.
[02:46:24.482 --> 02:46:26.123]  Without you listeners, we couldn't do anything.
[02:46:26.463 --> 02:46:27.744]  Okay, well, that's fine.
[02:46:27.764 --> 02:46:28.184]  Thank you.
[02:46:29.305 --> 02:46:33.728]  And my plan is, once I get all of your videos, including Terror Storm,
[02:46:34.561 --> 02:46:40.523]  I'm going to start burning copies, and then I'm going to contact a bunch of librarians and send them out to the library.
[02:46:40.543 --> 02:46:40.644]  Good.
[02:46:41.124 --> 02:46:42.064]  A lot of people have done that.
[02:46:42.084 --> 02:46:43.004]  It's very effective.
[02:46:43.465 --> 02:46:43.905]  Okay, good.
[02:46:43.925 --> 02:46:51.228]  Yeah, that's the first time I've thought of it, and I've been racking my brain trying to figure out what the best thing I could do with the resources I have.
[02:46:51.408 --> 02:46:56.230]  Get it placed in ten libraries in your city, and then thousands over the next few years will see it.
[02:46:56.490 --> 02:46:56.890]  There you go.
[02:46:58.123 --> 02:46:59.224]  That's all I had to say, man.
[02:46:59.264 --> 02:47:00.364]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[02:47:00.445 --> 02:47:01.645]  You really totally rock.
[02:47:01.986 --> 02:47:02.446]  No.
[02:47:02.846 --> 02:47:04.067]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:04.387 --> 02:47:05.968]  We realize the threat to humanity.
[02:47:06.508 --> 02:47:07.889]  Look, I've thrown myself into this 110%.
[02:47:08.089 --> 02:47:09.991]  Point of no return, all that.
[02:47:10.711 --> 02:47:12.392]  And so I'm fighting 110%, folks.
[02:47:12.412 --> 02:47:13.333]  This is about survival.
[02:47:13.353 --> 02:47:14.854]  I mean, you heard the people we had on earlier.
[02:47:14.894 --> 02:47:17.355]  They got them in custody and said, we'll cut your arms off.
[02:47:17.415 --> 02:47:22.779]  I mean, that's the type of evil, wickedness that we're facing.
[02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:26.561]  These are monsters, you know, inhuman guys walking the countryside.
[02:47:26.601 --> 02:47:27.502]  And I'm going to fight them.
[02:47:27.941 --> 02:47:30.765]  Yes, Alex, I was wanting to know, would you ever have Kevin Trudeau on your show?
[02:47:44.196 --> 02:47:49.760]  A lot of people have requested I have Kevin Trudeau on, and I haven't had enough time to research him or read any of his works.
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:52.803]  I know he's a little bit controversial, and I'm not against controversial people.
[02:47:53.523 --> 02:48:01.109]  On, I just need to do research first, and I haven't been able to do that about Mr. Trudeau, so I don't know yet if I'm going to do that, but I'm looking into it.
[02:48:01.529 --> 02:48:05.132]  Okay, before I go also, I've been trying to get on your podcast,
[02:48:08.530 --> 02:48:13.473]  To see the movies and stuff on that website, you have to have a credit card to get it, though?
[02:48:13.754 --> 02:48:14.734]  Yes, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:48:14.754 --> 02:48:17.276]  But all I have is a debit card.
[02:48:17.616 --> 02:48:18.777]  You don't have to do that, sir.
[02:48:18.797 --> 02:48:21.099]  You can buy PayPal credits.
[02:48:21.159 --> 02:48:22.340]  I don't have PayPal either.
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:24.301]  Well, I mean, you just get PayPal.
[02:48:25.682 --> 02:48:27.223]  I mean, a debit card will work on there, sir.
[02:48:27.987 --> 02:48:28.648]  Okay.
[02:48:28.868 --> 02:48:29.509]  Have a good day.
[02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:30.170]  Thank you.
[02:48:30.190 --> 02:48:32.794]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:32.854 --> 02:48:34.176]  That's the nature of the system.
[02:48:34.656 --> 02:48:36.999]  We allow people to get yearly memberships by sending in a check.
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:37.840]  You can do that.
[02:48:37.921 --> 02:48:38.902]  Instructions are on the site.
[02:48:39.162 --> 02:48:40.104]  But thank you for attempting it.
[02:48:40.124 --> 02:48:40.804]  All right.
[02:48:40.865 --> 02:48:43.949]  Dan, Steve, and Aaron, you'll be our last callers on the other side.
[02:48:46.949 --> 02:48:49.791]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.051 --> 02:48:50.752]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:50.852 --> 02:48:51.633]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.993 --> 02:48:56.656]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.997 --> 02:49:03.742]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.062 --> 02:49:06.044]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.244 --> 02:49:09.087]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.167 --> 02:49:13.831]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.051 --> 02:49:18.455]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.695 --> 02:49:25.902]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.182 --> 02:49:28.584]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.764 --> 02:49:30.486]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:46.195 --> 02:49:50.076]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:50.316 --> 02:49:55.757]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:56.037 --> 02:50:06.380]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.901]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:11.101 --> 02:50:19.443]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:19.723 --> 02:50:26.085]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:50:26.185 --> 02:50:30.666]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:30.886 --> 02:50:35.108]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:50:35.468 --> 02:50:39.769]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.989]  We're good to go.
[02:51:02.941 --> 02:51:03.622]  We're good to go.
[02:51:32.501 --> 02:51:35.582]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.762 --> 02:51:41.703]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:50.306 --> 02:51:57.747]  TV stations and the Associated Press report Limbaugh was caught with more than just Viagra, other prescription drugs that he didn't have a prescription for.
[02:51:58.168 --> 02:51:59.928]  The media is spinning it that it was just Viagra.
[02:52:01.047 --> 02:52:06.070]  And the point is, I've heard him many times say, throw the key away with young people caught with narcotics.
[02:52:07.010 --> 02:52:13.373]  But then he's an addict of synthetic narcotics, opiates, hillbilly heroin, Oxycontin and other goodies.
[02:52:14.314 --> 02:52:18.456]  And just, it's unbelievable how hypocritical all these people are.
[02:52:18.816 --> 02:52:20.597]  I'm just going to state that again on the record.
[02:52:21.678 --> 02:52:25.039]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in California.
[02:52:25.079 --> 02:52:26.040]  Dan, welcome.
[02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:26.780]  Alex.
[02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:27.661]  Hi.
[02:52:27.941 --> 02:52:28.341]  Good show.
[02:52:29.424 --> 02:52:32.888]  Rush Limbaugh, he really fits the profile of a master mason.
[02:52:32.948 --> 02:52:39.033]  If you listen to him and he says he's the all-knowing, telling on loan from God, all-knowing, all-seeing eye.
[02:52:39.614 --> 02:52:46.020]  I mean, smart guy, but I just, maybe he does all those drugs and I'm just conscious because he knows he's being used or he's
[02:52:47.330 --> 02:52:56.417]  Well, I mean, I remember listening to Limbaugh 15 years ago and liking him, but the bragging was actually turning me off to him even before I woke up to the false left paradigm about 12, 13 years ago.
[02:52:56.437 --> 02:53:01.181]  I was just like, I'm on talent alone from God.
[02:53:01.301 --> 02:53:02.742]  I'm the biggest brain of them all.
[02:53:02.842 --> 02:53:03.502]  I'm the best.
[02:53:04.123 --> 02:53:06.685]  I mean, that may fool some people, but that's really obnoxious.
[02:53:06.845 --> 02:53:09.567]  The more I know, the more I know, the more I don't know.
[02:53:10.067 --> 02:53:10.307]  Right.
[02:53:10.948 --> 02:53:11.929]  I think it's interesting.
[02:53:11.969 --> 02:53:14.951]  He used to really say, I am all-knowing.
[02:53:15.482 --> 02:53:15.803]  I think.
[02:53:33.587 --> 02:53:37.548]  I was wondering if you had any problems at the airport when you left.
[02:53:38.208 --> 02:53:38.428]  No.
[02:53:39.048 --> 02:53:40.688]  And when I left Canada, the U.S.
[02:53:40.728 --> 02:53:43.969]  Customs were winking and smiling and saying, Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[02:53:43.989 --> 02:53:46.529]  I don't want to get the guy in trouble, but he said some other stuff.
[02:53:47.050 --> 02:53:49.570]  So I basically had red carpet treatment back into the U.S.
[02:53:50.330 --> 02:53:52.711]  Oh, I mean from Los Angeles?
[02:53:52.731 --> 02:53:52.771]  No.
[02:53:52.851 --> 02:53:53.791]  Absolutely no problem.
[02:53:53.871 --> 02:53:54.191]  Great.
[02:53:54.271 --> 02:53:54.731]  That's great.
[02:53:55.391 --> 02:53:57.271]  It was a great conference.
[02:53:57.571 --> 02:53:59.872]  Words can't even describe the emotion and the movement.
[02:54:01.112 --> 02:54:05.414]  It's very moving, especially your closing, because that's all real.
[02:54:05.494 --> 02:54:19.400]  Some people might not understand that Alex... I'd like to admonish everyone listening to pray for Alex and his family and what he does.
[02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:23.201]  It's really very genuine and authentic.
[02:54:23.382 --> 02:54:28.344]  He's not doing what he does for money or he's not grandstanding, but...
[02:54:29.992 --> 02:54:39.139]  I just... We're trying to boldly fight these criminals with every scrap of our sinew, and that's what it comes down to at the end of the day.
[02:54:39.179 --> 02:54:41.441]  And I really appreciate your kind words, my friend.
[02:54:41.481 --> 02:54:41.862]  Take care.
[02:54:42.002 --> 02:54:42.602]  One quick thing.
[02:54:42.642 --> 02:54:48.247]  Jesse Ventura had made some statements about he didn't buy Billing 7.
[02:54:48.287 --> 02:54:49.208]  He had problems with that.
[02:54:49.448 --> 02:54:49.828]  That's right.
[02:54:49.848 --> 02:54:51.890]  He said that on Jay Leno.
[02:54:52.483 --> 02:54:55.904]  And I was wondering if you have ever interviewed him or attempted to contact him?
[02:54:55.924 --> 02:54:57.985]  We probably called him ten times or more.
[02:54:58.165 --> 02:54:59.866]  We can't get through all the handlers.
[02:55:00.386 --> 02:55:00.686]  Okay.
[02:55:01.166 --> 02:55:07.749]  He started crying on TV, and he said, I did a lot of bad things in Vietnam, and I just want to say that the 9-11 story is a fraud.
[02:55:07.769 --> 02:55:09.450]  He started getting up and started tearing up.
[02:55:09.970 --> 02:55:15.692]  Because even powerful people who probably are pretty corrupt, if you still have a soul, this stuff hits you.
[02:55:15.732 --> 02:55:16.413]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:16.453 --> 02:55:17.573]  That's something we've got to work on.
[02:55:17.833 --> 02:55:19.914]  Ventura, don't stop until we get Ventura.
[02:55:21.111 --> 02:55:21.652]  Real quick.
[02:55:22.092 --> 02:55:22.833]  Steve in Texas.
[02:55:22.873 --> 02:55:23.313]  Go ahead.
[02:55:26.035 --> 02:55:26.536]  Yes, Steve.
[02:55:26.716 --> 02:55:27.476]  Turn your radio off.
[02:55:29.538 --> 02:55:30.359]  He's not listening.
[02:55:30.419 --> 02:55:30.959]  Okay, Steve.
[02:55:30.999 --> 02:55:31.400]  Thank you.
[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:33.001]  Aaron in Nevada.
[02:55:33.041 --> 02:55:33.561]  Last caller.
[02:55:33.601 --> 02:55:34.262]  Go ahead, Aaron.
[02:55:34.282 --> 02:55:35.683]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:36.343 --> 02:55:45.491]  I just was listening to another station, and the guy was talking about the new program to control the media.
[02:55:46.909 --> 02:55:50.973]  And everybody who was calling in was just, Oh, yes, it's a great idea.
[02:55:50.993 --> 02:55:51.833]  It's a wonderful idea.
[02:55:52.154 --> 02:55:53.555]  That's what Hitler did.
[02:55:53.895 --> 02:55:55.316]  Yeah, let's arrest reporters.
[02:55:55.396 --> 02:55:56.197]  It's good.
[02:55:56.697 --> 02:55:58.699]  We don't need talking bad about the government.
[02:55:58.739 --> 02:55:59.600]  It's the new freedom.
[02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:00.961]  Defend America.
[02:56:00.981 --> 02:56:02.302]  Arrest all the reporters.
[02:56:02.362 --> 02:56:03.123]  It's freedom.
[02:56:03.663 --> 02:56:04.304]  It's freedom.
[02:56:04.364 --> 02:56:05.625]  We love you, George W.
[02:56:06.408 --> 02:56:06.728]  I know.
[02:56:06.768 --> 02:56:10.450]  I was listening and I was sick to my stomach hearing that.
[02:56:10.470 --> 02:56:13.131]  Well, that's conservatism arresting members of the press.
[02:56:13.471 --> 02:56:14.132]  Thanks for the call.
[02:56:14.152 --> 02:56:14.872]  We're out of time.
[02:56:14.912 --> 02:56:16.032]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:16.513 --> 02:56:18.173]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:18.253 --> 02:56:19.834]  More great GCN programming coming up.
[02:56:20.094 --> 02:56:21.155]  Counter-programming, that is.
[02:56:21.955 --> 02:56:22.856]  God bless you all.
