[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:04.691]  So bad, and I meant to write notes on this, with Fetzer.
[00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:06.612]  He won't let him talk, at all.
[00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:09.214]  He just keeps calling him an American hater.
[00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.775]  Fetzer, who's a pretty aggressive guy, kind of takes it.
[00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.577]  Of course, he knows he won't be allowed back on if he doesn't sit there and take it.
[00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:21.320]  I mean, listen, I've had Fox set me up about six times the last few months, and they always cancel.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.540]  Because they're afraid.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.441]  I will go on there and clean their clocks.
[00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.262]  I am not intimidated by Bill O'Reilly.
[00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:27.423]  The guy's a punk.
[00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:27.923]  He's a punk.
[00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:31.347]  And he's a fake.
[00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:33.971]  And he's a joke.
[00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:36.254]  Let's go ahead and play a little bit of this, then we'll go to break.
[00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:36.875]  And I'll write notes.
[00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:37.556]  I'm going to come back for break.
[00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:38.938]  I'll comment on the clip you hear.
[00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.020]  We'll come back and play the rest of it.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.385]  Here is Bill O'Reilly attacking Fetzer on Fox.
[00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:44.186]  What was it last night?
[00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:57.187]  In fact, segment tonight, as we told you last night, University of Wisconsin instructor Kevin Barrett has called President Bush a murderer, saying he orchestrated 9-11 without providing a shred of evidence of that charge.
[00:00:57.187 --> 00:01:02.650]  Despite that defamation, Barrett teaching a course on Islam this semester at the University of Wisconsin.
[00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.631]  The only sanction against him is an order to stop making public statements.
[00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:12.597]  Joining us now from Madison is James Fetzer, a recent retired professor from the University of Minnesota Duluth who supports Barrett.
[00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:25.328]  You know, I'm getting a little tired of Barrett and Ward Churchill and other college professors who hate their country and who bring this hatred onto a campus full of impressionable students.
[00:01:25.328 --> 00:01:29.592]  Am I wrong to be offended and angry about that, sir?
[00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:32.455]  Well, you are wrong, Bill, because you haven't studied the case.
[00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:43.398]  Created an organization consisting of experts and scholars, pilots, aeronautical engineers, mechanical engineers, structural engineers, civil engineers, physicists.
[00:01:43.398 --> 00:01:48.059]  We've been examining what the government's been telling us and frankly, Bill, it's a fantasy.
[00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:51.560]  None of the major claims made by the government can be sustained.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.380]  We've been looking at this from every point of view.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.661]  The government has a story it wants to sell us.
[00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:56.461]  We're not buying it.
[00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.842]  Okay, you don't have to buy anything.
[00:01:57.842 --> 00:01:58.422]  You're American.
[00:01:58.422 --> 00:01:59.823]  You want to be a nut, you can be a nut.
[00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:00.723]  And you are a nut.
[00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:11.590]  Because in order for any conspiracy of this magnitude to take place, thousands of Americans would have to buy into it, would have to know about it, and would have to keep their mouth shut about it.
[00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.451]  That's never going to happen.
[00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:18.594]  You're like the guys who think that the space aliens kidnapped Elvis or something like that.
[00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:21.496]  That's where you are, in my opinion.
[00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:25.158]  So your opinion is that Bush murdered everybody on 9-11, seized control,
[00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:28.960]  Make him the dictator of America, whatever the crazy thing is.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.882]  And my opinion is, you are nuts.
[00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:33.704]  We're both entitled to our opinion, okay?
[00:02:33.704 --> 00:02:35.385]  So you're entitled and I'm entitled.
[00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:37.046]  And we'll let the folks decide.
[00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:38.167]  Hold it, hold it.
[00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:45.532]  But now you have a guy, Barrett, who's in a classroom, and we had the students on last night, and believe me, the students don't know very much.
[00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:52.797]  And here's Barrett, and here's Ward Churchill, and they're bringing their crazy theories in, explaining this, that, and the other thing.
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:02.545]  Eight different points in the first two minutes of Bill Pervert Sexual Harasser Riley.
[00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:03.506]  Okay?
[00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:07.288]  When we get back, I'm gonna go over those first eight.
[00:03:14.355 --> 00:03:20.184]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:27.815]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:35.943]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:47.685]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:51.646]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:53.906]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:57.747]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:05.044 --> 00:06:20.637]  Ken Jenkins coming up in the second segment in the next hour.
[00:06:20.637 --> 00:06:23.719]  It will be about eight after.
[00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:35.172]  We will have open phones during that interview as well, maybe even keep them a little bit into the third hour.
[00:06:35.172 --> 00:06:37.533]  Again, it is Friday.
[00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:40.034]  Alright, I'm gonna air the rest of the O'Reilly clip in a minute.
[00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:45.756]  He basically doesn't let Fetzer talk after that first three sentences he allowed him to say.
[00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:47.516]  And let's go through it, okay?
[00:06:47.516 --> 00:06:51.198]  And this is eight points just in... that I just scribbled down earlier.
[00:06:51.198 --> 00:06:53.118]  There were a lot more.
[00:06:53.118 --> 00:06:56.459]  He states, you're a nut, no facts, over and over again.
[00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:57.680]  And that's an ad hominem.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.520]  That's just name-calling.
[00:06:59.156 --> 00:07:09.240]  He says space aliens abducting Elvis, combining two of the archetypal kook ideas that really the media has popularized as a joke.
[00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.262]  He then talks about Ward Churchill, who said the people... He did say something despicable.
[00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:19.203]  He said the people that died in those towers were a bunch of Nazis.
[00:07:19.203 --> 00:07:20.904]  They worked for the Nazis.
[00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:25.567]  And so Al-Qaeda was this great, wonderful thing, striking the evil American empire.
[00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:32.730]  That is classic military-industrial-complex-controlled, fake liberal trash.
[00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.190]  Okay?
[00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.412]  And Ward Churchill, I've been around him personally.
[00:07:35.412 --> 00:07:36.772]  I know people that have interviewed him.
[00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:38.193]  He's rude and mean offset.
[00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:43.852]  He is a hate-filled bigot.
[00:07:43.852 --> 00:07:45.213]  So he's the extreme.
[00:07:45.213 --> 00:07:49.956]  But I still think he has the right to go spew his Ford Foundation stuff.
[00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:54.978]  Kevin Barrett is an intelligent, dynamic, informed person who they're saying has no facts.
[00:07:54.978 --> 00:07:56.199]  But he wouldn't let them give any of the facts.
[00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:59.561]  Kevin Barrett brings up nothing but facts.
[00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:03.824]  And so they're trying to kill academic freedom in this country and they limited what Fetzer could say.
[00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:07.906]  So you had all of that attempt to mix him in with Churchill.
[00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:14.539]  What Kevin Barrett and others are saying is the facts, that Al Qaeda is really CIA, is a front, is a creation.
[00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:15.481]  We have the evidence.
[00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:21.327]  We have Zbigniew Brzezinski bragging about Operation Cyclone, the admissions, starting the war with the Russians.
[00:08:21.327 --> 00:08:27.074]  The Russians didn't just come in and attack the Afghans, the Afghans attacked them, and then the Russians came in.
[00:08:27.074 --> 00:08:29.137]  We have him saying, show me one mainstream
[00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:32.902]  The New York Times, this, this, and that.
[00:08:32.902 --> 00:08:33.982]  They all hate Bush.
[00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:36.704]  They would all print this if they could.
[00:08:36.704 --> 00:08:43.209]  It's the New York Times that's all CIA infiltrated going back to the church hearings in the 70s.
[00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:45.831]  They're the folks that put out the aluminum tubes, the yellow cake.
[00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:47.772]  They pose as liberals.
[00:08:47.772 --> 00:08:49.113]  They are gatekeepers.
[00:08:49.113 --> 00:08:52.755]  They're there to control liberals in this country who they're afraid of.
[00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:54.857]  They're there as Judas goes to corral you.
[00:08:55.506 --> 00:08:59.028]  It's basic psychology, basic manipulation here.
[00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:01.349]  Good cop, bad cop.
[00:09:01.349 --> 00:09:03.750]  And he says they would report on it.
[00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.333]  Well, they've been forced to report many of the facts of the truth movement.
[00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:11.094]  They've been forced to come out and write hit pieces on us.
[00:09:11.094 --> 00:09:15.716]  In fact, many of the publications he mentioned have written hit pieces on myself personally.
[00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:17.717]  Saying the Bilderberg Group doesn't exist.
[00:09:17.717 --> 00:09:18.958]  I'm crazy.
[00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.579]  Five years ago in the New York Times.
[00:09:21.372 --> 00:09:26.777]  The Washington Post has attacked me saying that we're all a bunch of kooks, but never giving any information.
[00:09:26.777 --> 00:09:29.519]  They attacked me two weeks after 9-11, or a week and a half after.
[00:09:30.996 --> 00:09:34.539]  And then they say thousands of Americans would have to be involved to cover this up.
[00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:43.306]  Well, thousands knew that tens of thousands of black men weren't just allowed to have syphilis for 40 plus years, but were allowed to spread it, and in some cases were given it.
[00:09:43.306 --> 00:09:47.469]  With Tuskegee, 110,000 Jewish children irradiated under U.S.
[00:09:47.469 --> 00:09:51.592]  government funding in Israel, kept secret until a few years ago, now front page in Israel.
[00:09:52.213 --> 00:10:01.297]  The fact that over 10,000 Nazis were brought here to run almost every federal program, from rocketry, to torture, to surveillance, to COINTELPRO.
[00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:02.137]  Nazis.
[00:10:02.137 --> 00:10:03.838]  10 plus thousand of them.
[00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:07.259]  My grandpa was an oil hand and a lease hound out in Midland.
[00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:09.420]  There were Nazis everywhere out there.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.701]  This is the reality of what's going on.
[00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:13.502]  So he says thousands couldn't do this.
[00:10:13.502 --> 00:10:16.143]  Oh yeah, over 100,000 involved in the Manhattan Project.
[00:10:16.143 --> 00:10:17.544]  Secret for three and a half years.
[00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.500]  Of course they kept it secret.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:29.363]  It only took about 200 people, with all the different analysts and people that have studied this, people who have been in black ops, 200 to plant the bombs, run the attacks, everything.
[00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:37.406]  And if you don't think this government doesn't have 200 people that will kill 3,000 Americans for total power and control, you got another thing coming.
[00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:43.849]  Folks, they kill millions of us every year with the drug company drugs, with the malpractice, with the stuff in our food, with the stuff in our water.
[00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:45.090]  They could care less about you.
[00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.611]  They dump pure nerve gas off the coast of North Carolina.

[00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:15.518]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:16.819]  Big Brother.
[00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:18.600]  Mainstream media.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.741]  Government cover-ups.
[00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:21.122]  You want answers?
[00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:23.470]  Well, so does he.
[00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12:27.652 --> 00:12:34.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:12:34.016 --> 00:12:38.619]  Alright, I'm continuing for this little five-minute segment with my analysis of Bill O'Reilly.
[00:12:38.619 --> 00:12:44.382]  And then coming up, we're going to have Ken Jenkins of 9-11 Truth in the studio, a great filmmaker.
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.862]  We're really excited to have him joining us.
[00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:49.023]  He's going to be here in Austin tonight.
[00:12:49.023 --> 00:12:52.726]  He is here in Austin today, showing his new film.
[00:12:52.726 --> 00:12:54.668]  We'll tell you all about that coming up.
[00:12:54.668 --> 00:12:57.030]  Get into 9-11 and take your phone calls.
[00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:05.617]  We talk a lot about 9-11 every week here because it is a foundation event, something that they've used as a pretext for their entire geopolitical and domestic policy.
[00:13:05.617 --> 00:13:11.302]  But let's play the second half of O'Reilly, who, number one, won't let Jim Fetzer talk.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:23.822]  The founder, one of the heads of 9-11 Truth, who hits every buzzword that he believes in space aliens, and Elvis is kidnapped, and he's a nut, and he has no facts, and no newspapers will print what he's saying.
[00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:29.128]  And the newspapers he links are the worst CIA fronts.
[00:13:29.128 --> 00:13:33.732]  Fake news, 1.6 billion that Bush paid for, admittedly.
[00:13:33.732 --> 00:13:34.973]  That was in the news last year.
[00:13:34.973 --> 00:13:36.714]  Fake reporters everywhere.
[00:13:36.714 --> 00:13:37.835]  Hit pieces everywhere.
[00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:44.400]  This just doesn't work anymore, O'Reilly, telling us how, oh, the liberal media would love to attack Bush.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.580]  It's not liberal media.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.001]  It's not conservative media.
[00:13:47.001 --> 00:13:49.924]  It's military-industrial complex media.
[00:13:49.924 --> 00:13:50.444]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:50.444 --> 00:13:51.605]  And there have been a few fair ones.
[00:13:51.605 --> 00:13:52.926]  The new one in Vanity Fair was fair.
[00:13:53.604 --> 00:13:58.108]  There have been a few fair here and there, and people, I talk to reporters all the time, they go, oh we know the truth.
[00:13:58.108 --> 00:14:03.852]  My editor won't let me get it out, but I'll try to at least let you get a few of your quotes in on your website, okay?
[00:14:03.852 --> 00:14:07.675]  And I'll show the other side, but try not to make you look too bad, okay?
[00:14:07.675 --> 00:14:11.058]  I know all about it, and I'm sorry, I'm controlled, I'm pathetic.
[00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.339]  I mean, I've talked to scores of them.
[00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:18.163]  I don't want to get into names here, but I mean it's just when they admit to you they know, but that they can't.
[00:14:18.163 --> 00:14:23.364]  I've talked to CNN people for some of the biggest shows and they go, oh we know it's CIA, we know it's all controlled up here.
[00:14:23.364 --> 00:14:33.966]  You know on their cell phone after hours and they say call them back and they go, yeah we had you on and then Chairman King got real mad at CNN and so he refused to come on and now you're not going to come on and we've cancelled Ed Asner.
[00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:36.187]  You know, oh yeah we got pressure from the government.
[00:14:36.187 --> 00:14:40.348]  And then there have been reporters lately come out and go, oh we got pressure from the government.
[00:14:40.348 --> 00:14:41.588]  I mean how do you think this works?
[00:14:41.588 --> 00:14:42.548]  Here's the rest of O'Reilly.
[00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:46.735]  You got that O'Reilly clip ready, bro?
[00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:47.636]  In my opinion.
[00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:55.124]  So your opinion is that Bush murdered everybody on 9-11 to seize control and make him the dictator of America, whatever crazy thing it is.
[00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:57.046]  And my opinion is, you are nuts.
[00:14:57.046 --> 00:14:59.869]  We're both entitled to our opinion, okay?
[00:14:59.869 --> 00:15:01.530]  So you're entitled and I'm entitled.
[00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.212]  And we'll let the folks decide.
[00:15:03.212 --> 00:15:03.553]  Hold it.
[00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:03.813]  Hold it.
[00:15:04.326 --> 00:15:21.673]  But now you have a guy, Barrett, who's in a classroom, and we had the students on last night, and believe me, the students don't know very much, and here's Barrett, and here's Ward Churchill, and they're bringing their crazy theories in, explaining this, that, and the other thing, and whatever conclusions you guys have reached.
[00:15:21.673 --> 00:15:28.855]  And the students are there, absorbing this, and I'm saying this is grossly irresponsible, because it's based on nothing.
[00:15:28.855 --> 00:15:32.897]  If you had the evidence, sir, you would be on the front page of the New York Times in a heartbeat.
[00:15:33.397 --> 00:15:38.060]  There's nothing that the hatebush media would like more than to get a hold of anything you have.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.201]  And you don't have anything.
[00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:44.184]  You can't get into the San Francisco Chronicle, or the National Enquirer, or anywhere.
[00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:47.767]  Because you don't have anything other than a harebrained theory.
[00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:48.327]  And you know it.
[00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:50.932]  We have hundreds of studies.
[00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:51.713]  We have documents.
[00:15:51.713 --> 00:15:52.213]  We have records.
[00:15:52.213 --> 00:15:54.915]  Well, why can't you get on the front page of the New York Times?
[00:15:54.915 --> 00:16:00.739]  Anyone, Bill, who has even looked at the collapse of Building 7 understands it came down by controlled demolition.
[00:16:00.739 --> 00:16:02.961]  It wasn't hit by a nuclear bomb.
[00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:05.923]  I had guys in here who say you're full of... You know what?
[00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:09.065]  Why can't you get this on the front page of the Boston Globe?
[00:16:09.065 --> 00:16:10.927]  Or the Atlanta Journal-Constitution?
[00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:12.988]  Or the Minneapolis Star-Tribune?
[00:16:12.988 --> 00:16:15.310]  Papers that despise the Bush administration.
[00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.792]  Why can't you get it on the front page of those papers?
[00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:24.260]  The press and the media are too much dominated by the federal government and federal regulations, Bill, you know that.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:30.628]  The New York Times is dominated and afraid of the federal government when every single day they rip Bush's throat out.
[00:16:30.628 --> 00:16:32.070]  Come on, that doesn't make any sense.
[00:16:33.005 --> 00:16:45.291]  In 1977, Carl Bernstein published an article in the Rolling Stone in which he explained that he'd been told by officials of the CIA that their greatest successes have been with CBS, with Time Life, and with the New York Times, Bill.
[00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.192]  The situation today is much worse.
[00:16:47.192 --> 00:16:52.114]  Anyone who wants to know the truth should go to st911.org, our website.
[00:16:52.114 --> 00:16:57.116]  Scholars for 9-11 Truth, and they'll find it in spades, Bill.
[00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:57.717]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:57.717 --> 00:16:58.477]  We'll finish up the little
[00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:02.418]  Tail into that later in the shower and get Ken Jenkins' take on it.
[00:17:02.418 --> 00:17:04.139]  We'll get him a headset so we can hear it.
[00:17:04.139 --> 00:17:04.799]  Stay with us, folks.
[00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:14.201]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:14.881]  It's here.
[00:17:14.881 --> 00:17:20.043]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:17:20.043 --> 00:17:27.665]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:17:28.385 --> 00:17:35.831]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:17:35.831 --> 00:17:47.559]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:17:47.559 --> 00:17:51.522]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:17:51.522 --> 00:17:53.804]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:17:53.804 --> 00:17:57.567]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:16.475]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:18:16.475 --> 00:18:24.822]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:18:24.822 --> 00:18:31.868]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:32.968]  We're good to go!
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.201]  We're good.
[00:19:11.323 --> 00:19:14.726]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.

[00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:39.045]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com

[00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:19.024]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:20:19.024 --> 00:20:21.987]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:34.179 --> 00:20:47.831]  Alright, last hour and the end of this hour and the last segment, I was playing clips of Bill O'Reilly attacking Jim Fetzer of 9-11 Truth, scholars for 9-11 Truth, and he doesn't hit him on any of the facts.
[00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:56.599]  He just keeps saying, you're a nut, you have no facts, you believe in space aliens, you're a kook, you hate America, you and Ward Churchill's theories.
[00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:58.841]  Ward Churchill doesn't have theories.
[00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:07.028]  Okay, he was there in Colorado and lost his professorship last time I checked, because he said the people in the towers were Nazis and basically deserved to die.
[00:21:07.028 --> 00:21:09.089]  I mean, his quotes were incredible.
[00:21:09.089 --> 00:21:14.630]  And so notice that, see, because Al-Qaeda's good, striking the evil Americans.
[00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.131]  The government would love the left to have that view.
[00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:23.753]  No one I know has that view, as conservative, liberal, any political affiliation or term.
[00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.606]  But notice O'Reilly said it like five times.
[00:21:27.606 --> 00:21:31.630]  You and Ward Churchill and your group, you're with Ward Churchill and these theories.
[00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.852]  Ward Churchill thinks Al-Qaeda hit America.
[00:21:33.852 --> 00:21:35.814]  He believes what you believe, O'Reilly.
[00:21:35.814 --> 00:21:37.516]  He isn't a quote, theorist.
[00:21:37.516 --> 00:21:39.338]  He isn't a researcher.
[00:21:39.338 --> 00:21:39.638]  Okay?
[00:21:39.638 --> 00:21:41.940]  He just basically hates white people.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.322]  He's a self-hater.
[00:21:43.322 --> 00:21:43.542]  Okay?
[00:21:43.542 --> 00:21:46.145]  I'm not into anybody who hates any race or any group.
[00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:47.106]  We're all the human race.
[00:21:47.794 --> 00:21:52.075]  And so stop trying to equate the 9-11 Truth Movement with Ward Churchill.
[00:21:52.075 --> 00:21:53.835]  He does it continually.
[00:21:53.835 --> 00:21:56.596]  I watch the clips of him online every time he does that.
[00:21:56.596 --> 00:22:01.357]  Because people hate Ward Churchill and they rightfully should disagree with him, in my opinion.
[00:22:01.357 --> 00:22:02.917]  But again, straw man.
[00:22:02.917 --> 00:22:04.077]  Guilt by association.
[00:22:04.077 --> 00:22:08.998]  It's like going, you and Jeffrey Dahmer, well, you and Jeffrey Dahmer have these theories.
[00:22:08.998 --> 00:22:10.959]  So it's a very disingenuous attack.
[00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:11.879]  He won't let him talk.
[00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:16.194]  He says they don't have a shred of evidence that won't let him talk.
[00:22:16.194 --> 00:22:17.875]  He then says the media would cover this.
[00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:19.457]  They have been forced to.
[00:22:19.457 --> 00:22:22.980]  They'll show some of our facts and then say, well, we don't know what to say.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.522]  Okay, we've proven the official story a lie.
[00:22:25.522 --> 00:22:27.864]  But like a lawyer, O'Reilly keeps repeating it.
[00:22:27.864 --> 00:22:29.526]  Oh, why isn't it in one?
[00:22:29.526 --> 00:22:30.787]  Oh, why isn't it in one?
[00:22:30.787 --> 00:22:31.908]  Oh, why can't you get it in one?
[00:22:31.908 --> 00:22:32.609]  Why can't you?
[00:22:32.609 --> 00:22:32.989]  Huh?
[00:22:32.989 --> 00:22:33.349]  Huh?
[00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:33.730]  Huh?
[00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:36.052]  Again, it's that prosecutor tactic.
[00:22:37.166 --> 00:22:46.632]  And to a low common denominator, the mind-numbed Hitlerian worshippers, and that's what they are, who believe... I mean, folks, sometimes I watch Fox News as comedy.
[00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:49.554]  I've laid in bed before, and I'm like, this is a joke!
[00:22:49.554 --> 00:22:52.796]  It is like a comic book!
[00:22:52.796 --> 00:22:52.996]  So...
[00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:55.690]  Paul Watson, you've heard my rant.
[00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:56.831]  You've heard the points I've made.
[00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:57.752]  Please go get the points.
[00:22:57.752 --> 00:22:58.752]  Have whatever points you'd like.
[00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:01.154]  I want to report about O'Reilly on this.
[00:23:01.154 --> 00:23:06.038]  About O'Reilly's dishonesty in attacking the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:23:06.038 --> 00:23:09.240]  His juvenile tactics.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.165]  He hits every single propaganda point you can imagine.
[00:23:15.165 --> 00:23:17.787]  That is in the lower drawer of propaganda.
[00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:19.408]  He hits every point you could hit.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.041]  From a mindless perspective.
[00:23:22.041 --> 00:23:22.982]  And he's a smart guy.
[00:23:22.982 --> 00:23:26.083]  He is playing to his idiot audience.
[00:23:26.083 --> 00:23:26.363]  Okay?
[00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:29.745]  He's playing to his idiot audience.
[00:23:29.745 --> 00:23:32.907]  Now, there's going to be an event here tonight in Austin.
