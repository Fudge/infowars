[00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:06.102]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:07.844]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:09.647]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.308 --> 00:00:11.069]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:12.755]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:17.376]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:21.757]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:26.779]  It was five years ago today...
[00:00:42.319 --> 00:01:02.652]  On this very broadcast, in this very minute of air time, that I announced Operation Expose the Government Terrorist, I got on air, on radio and on my local television show in Austin, Texas, and launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist, and I said the Bush administration
[00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:07.800]  Controlled by globalist elements, we'll probably launch an attack in the next two to three months.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.363]  The most likely target being the World Trade Center Complex in Osama Bin Laden.
[00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:17.886]  The CIA asset will then take the blame for those attacks.
[00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:27.212]  And we will go into World War III, the beginning of World War III, and a huge police state being set up in the United States.
[00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:30.514]  And those attacks will only lead to greater attacks in the future.
[00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:41.089]  Five years ago today, July 25, 2001, I launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.350]  And of course we put a video clip of the TV show and my film, The Masters of Terror.
[00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.811]  We've played the audio here before and we've also posted it on the web for you.
[00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:58.352]  But five years ago today, that's a good article for Watson to write, just a little blurb,
[00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:18.319]  I launched Operation Expose the Government Terrorist, never done it before or since, and I posted on the TV show and here on the website of InfoWars.com, and of course on the radio show I gave out the White House and Congressional switchboards, and I said, call the Congress and tell them, please stop the executive branch from launching the attacks.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.481]  On record, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.822]  On record launching Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:34.786]  Just thought I would remind everybody of that because here we are five years later coming up on the fifth anniversary of 9-11 in two months as well.
[00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.251]  A lot of big news today.
[00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:44.514]  We've got Professor Stephen E. Jones joining us for the full hour next hour.
[00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:47.475]  He's not in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:49.196]  He's back east visiting family.
[00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:50.897]  His daughter is scheduled to have a child.
[00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.739]  She may have already had the child of the blessed day.
[00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:56.415]  But he's taking time out to join us.
[00:02:56.455 --> 00:02:57.396]  We appreciate that.
[00:02:57.416 --> 00:03:05.384]  Of course, the Brigham Young University physicist, the professor, the doctor, who's been exposing the controlled demolition of the World Trade Center towers and Building 7.
[00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.187]  Again, going back almost five years ago.
[00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:12.190]  He's gone public here in the last year and a half or so.
[00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.573]  Professor Stephen E. Jones joining us in the second hour.
[00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:17.855]  Meanwhile, let's launch into the news.
[00:03:19.674 --> 00:03:22.235]  Are claiming that there are targets in the U.S.
[00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.175]  that Hezbollah or Hamas may hit.
[00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:28.516]  Of course, that'll be the globalists hands down if there's a major attack.
[00:03:28.836 --> 00:03:32.297]  That'll be a perfect pretext to go ahead and go into Syria and Iran and get the U.S.
[00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:34.318]  in on the side of Israel.
[00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:39.499]  There's a distinct possibility that could happen unless we all scream bloody murder and expose it.
[00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.180]  Nations reluctant to commit troops to Lebanon, though they're being asked to.
[00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:51.947]  The King of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, has fears of a full-scale Middle Eastern war flaring.
[00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.471]  We have incredible video from a news report we're going to air later in the show.
[00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:03.054]  A Lebanese doctor says phosphorous weapons cause suffering and are being used in the bombs.
[00:04:03.094 --> 00:04:07.397]  The bombs are being filled, jacketed with the white phosphorous.
[00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:15.836]  And Israel is saying there can no longer be a Hezbollah and they must, I guess, rout them out of Lebanon, which I guess means total occupation.
[00:04:16.436 --> 00:04:31.167]  And, of course, yesterday one of the top ministers in Syria said that if they move into the north or even the central areas of Lebanon, Beirut or any other areas, that the Syrians may have to come into the war.
[00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:39.445]  Red Cross ambulances destroyed in Israeli airstrikes on rescue mission witnessed by British mainstream reporters.
[00:04:40.485 --> 00:04:42.987]  Panel chides Bush on bypassing laws.
[00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:45.268]  American Bar Association does that.
[00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:50.731]  Non-paying parents may be tagged with transponder tracker systems.
[00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.912]  License plate tracking for all.
[00:04:52.932 --> 00:04:54.133]  Another headline.
[00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:58.335]  It's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.256]  InfoWars.com is the website.
[00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:07.469]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.751]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:17.777]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.457 --> 00:05:25.502]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:32.787]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.341]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:41.141]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:43.502]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:47.763]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:00.777 --> 00:07:06.761]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:09.843]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:10.003 --> 00:07:14.606]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[00:07:14.786 --> 00:07:19.590]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.513]  This summer I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[00:07:24.733 --> 00:07:27.415]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:30.537]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:32.798]  Looking for profits?
[00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:34.280]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.822]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:07:37.882 --> 00:07:45.447]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.050]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.771]  Secure your position today.
[00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:52.272]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:07:52.352 --> 00:07:52.592]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:08.438]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.058 --> 00:08:12.080]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:21.445]  Alright, we've got three audio clips that I'm going to air throughout the first two hours.
[00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:23.966]  Professor Jones actually joins us in the third hour today.
[00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:25.736]  We've got three clips.
[00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:28.478]  One is out of Denver where the federal air marshals are ordered
[00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:57.768]  To put innocent people on watch lists to simply reach a quota.
[00:08:59.229 --> 00:09:13.985]  Another clip off of ITN British television where it shows the innocent families, just the vans, the cars, as they try to flee, under Israeli orders to flee, being bombed.
[00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:14.746]  And you can go to
[00:09:15.558 --> 00:09:23.334]  Infowars.com right now and you can look at burned year and a half old babies and five-year-old, six-year-old children.
[00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:33.236]  Got a bunch of other videos where you can see minivans that had, you know, five people on the roof and ten inside, or even more, it was eighteen, and then they fire Hellfire missiles at them.
[00:09:33.676 --> 00:09:37.339]  You can go look directly at that for yourself.
[00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:38.440]  It's kind of a sick joke.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:49.107]  Israel tells everybody to evacuate, then they evacuate, and the bridges have all been blown, so they can't evacuate, and then here come the helicopters and the jets dropping 500-pound bombs and firing missiles at them.
[00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:53.850]  And also strafing them with their gun cannons there in the nose.
[00:09:56.413 --> 00:09:58.354]  It's just, it's horrible!
[00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:10.738]  It's the exact same thing as a suicide bomber going on an Israeli bus and pulling the ripcord and detonating five to ten pounds of plastic explosives.
[00:10:11.158 --> 00:10:12.398]  I guess it isn't exactly the same.
[00:10:12.438 --> 00:10:18.740]  An Israeli pilot will do it from 10,000 feet or over the next hill with their Apache that U.S.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.222]  taxpayers paid for at absolutely no danger to themselves.
[00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:30.532]  So I guess there really is a difference because there's a danger for the suicide bomber.
[00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:34.294]  I'm sorry, Fox News is all told to call it homicide bomber.
[00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:37.396]  Excuse me, I've got to get into double think and double speak here and change that.
[00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:44.840]  There's a report here out of the Times of London that an Israeli drone, attack drone, began attacking its own troops.
[00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:51.109]  Yesterday, they were able to shut it off before it continued firing on them and before it killed anybody, they claim.
[00:10:51.129 --> 00:11:00.153]  So that's the fun of these drones, which are piloted and controlled by individuals in armored office building compounds just south of there.
[00:11:00.854 --> 00:11:13.660]  And it just shows the free-for-all bomb-shoot-anything-in-sight that the drones, again controlled by individuals basically in simulators a hundred miles away, are in control of.
[00:11:15.757 --> 00:11:17.758]  I guess not even 100 miles away, 20-30 miles away.
[00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:23.941]  Very small country, very small, tightly knit region over there.
[00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:26.963]  So we'll air that audio, the video of them bombing children.
[00:11:27.423 --> 00:11:34.067]  Then we have another video clip that goes back to Rachel Corey when they run over with the bulldozer.
[00:11:34.107 --> 00:11:38.249]  We've talked about that before, knowingly murdering an American citizen.
[00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:41.831]  But then the Israelis could debate it and claim it was an accident and they didn't mean it.
[00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:56.434]  But then it shows protesters there in the weeks after that, where the armored giant bulldozers pull up and fire M16 machine gun bullets at the peaceful protesters right over their heads, telling them to get out of there.
[00:11:56.834 --> 00:12:05.818]  And then they have huge nozzles that spray CS gas onto them, and they're there bulldozing houses.
[00:12:07.862 --> 00:12:19.267]  But people just standing there putting a wreath up a few days later after Rachel Corey was killed are assaulted by the Israeli troops because you never see this on US television.
[00:12:20.127 --> 00:12:29.851]  You never see what's really going on over there and it's never personalized what's happening to the Palestinians.
[00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:34.273]  So we'll play that clip for you.
[00:12:35.854 --> 00:12:36.214]  You know what?
[00:12:37.142 --> 00:12:47.106]  Instead of getting into Israel right now, they're now hyping that terrorists may hit us any minute, Hezbollah and Hamas, and we'll have to give up all of our rights and get into World War III just as soon as the terrorists hit us.
[00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:57.250]  Of course, the neocon crime cabal wants World War III, so do their Bilderberg masters to a great extent, though there is somewhat of a split now, we're getting reports on even in the CFR.
[00:12:58.491 --> 00:13:00.952]  In the elite right now, which is encouraging,
[00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.789]  But as we told you, they're now hyping.
[00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:05.210]  We told you they would.
[00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.732]  Hyping terrorist attacks that are sure to come in the U.S.
[00:13:08.212 --> 00:13:11.334]  So learn to worship the nice men in black uniforms and everything will be okay.
[00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:14.377]  And nations are reluctant to commit troops to Lebanon.
[00:13:14.397 --> 00:13:15.117]  We'll get into that.
[00:13:16.478 --> 00:13:18.920]  The king of Saudi Arabia fears full-scale war.
[00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:25.205]  And we will also get into Israel saying there can no longer be any Hezbollah.
[00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:28.487]  They're now talking about occupying the entire country and going house to house.
[00:13:28.527 --> 00:13:30.829]  And the Israeli military cannot do that alone.
[00:13:31.437 --> 00:13:34.538]  And there will have to be a terrorist attack somewhere in the western world to get us involved.
[00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:38.579]  And Israel is calling for foreign troops to go in there and fight and die for them right now.
[00:13:39.479 --> 00:13:43.781]  Red Cross ambulances again have been destroyed by Israeli airstrikes on a rescue mission.
[00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:47.302]  This is out of London Guardian.
[00:13:47.602 --> 00:13:52.623]  But before I do all of that, let's get into police state news first today.
[00:13:52.643 --> 00:13:59.405]  Because the last few weeks I've been not getting into the police state news because there has been so much other news internationally.
[00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.363]  And it's impossible to cover all the police state news of every day.
[00:14:03.423 --> 00:14:08.528]  We post that up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com and InfoWars.net.
[00:14:09.689 --> 00:14:11.230]  So let me just cover what we have today.
[00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:14.633]  Panel chides Bush on bypassing laws.
[00:14:14.773 --> 00:14:17.656]  A BA group cites limits to power.
[00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:18.657]  We'll get to that in a minute.
[00:14:20.387 --> 00:14:22.089]  Non-paying parents may be tagged.
[00:14:22.109 --> 00:14:22.810]  BBC.
[00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.572]  Parents who fail to pay child support.
[00:14:24.592 --> 00:14:25.813]  They're talking about that here in the U.S.
[00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:26.054]  too.
[00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:27.956]  Child support money could be tagged.
[00:14:28.116 --> 00:14:29.257]  Work and pensions.
[00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:30.879]  Secretary John Hutton said.
[00:14:32.881 --> 00:14:35.464]  Now, this is how it starts.
[00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:38.508]  Oh, just child molesters are going to have to be tagged.
[00:14:38.728 --> 00:14:40.150]  And they're talking about microchips now.
[00:14:41.053 --> 00:14:48.735]  And, oh, just bank robbers, or, oh, anybody who's not paid tickets for reckless driving.
[00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:52.835]  See, it expands into everything instantly.
[00:14:55.776 --> 00:15:05.938]  And so, not only have they expanded the sexual predator definition to a 16-year-old girl who has a 15-year-old boyfriend,
[00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:09.411]  Oh yeah, we're talking hardcore jail time.
[00:15:09.812 --> 00:15:11.133]  Two or three years in juvie.
[00:15:11.153 --> 00:15:14.076]  A year or two, in some cases, even after they turn 18.
[00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:17.639]  And then for the rest of your life, you're a sexual predator.
[00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:23.264]  Meanwhile, the government releases, after a few years, people that have actually raped children who deserve to have their brains blown out.
[00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.671]  Again, this is the new tyranny.
[00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:28.854]  You're drinking three beers in a bar, at a hotel bar.
[00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:29.895]  You don't even have a car.
[00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.736]  Police come in and arrest you in Texas.
[00:15:32.237 --> 00:15:33.478]  This is the new America.
[00:15:33.518 --> 00:15:35.099]  Three beers in an hour.
[00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:37.541]  They're sitting there watching as you watch the baseball game.
[00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:39.082]  See, everything's a crime.
[00:15:39.142 --> 00:15:41.224]  Everything's criminal except real crime.
[00:15:43.086 --> 00:15:44.186]  That's the nature of tyranny.
[00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:46.428]  But here it is.
[00:15:46.468 --> 00:15:48.350]  Non-paying parents may be tagged.
[00:15:49.736 --> 00:15:52.698]  And I see these reports all the time, getting back to sexual predators.
[00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:54.759]  This is now the subject of national debate.
[00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:55.819]  I'm hearing it on a lot of talk shows.
[00:15:56.219 --> 00:15:58.140]  And I've heard a lot of neocons actually defending it.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.941]  I heard one this morning driving into the office.
[00:16:00.702 --> 00:16:02.523]  He was on there saying, I don't care!
[00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:07.865]  If an 18-year-old goes out with a 17-year-old, put them in prison!
[00:16:11.287 --> 00:16:14.909]  If a 15-year-old goes out with a 14-year-old, put them in jail!
[00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.929]  Zero tolerance!
[00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:16.890]  They're sexual predators!
[00:16:18.582 --> 00:16:20.163]  I don't care even if it's consensual!
[00:16:20.644 --> 00:16:23.786]  Folks, I mean, how many of you were in high school?
[00:16:23.866 --> 00:16:24.806]  I mean, let's be honest.
[00:16:25.887 --> 00:16:27.809]  Now, I always tended to have older girlfriends.
[00:16:27.869 --> 00:16:29.230]  Would they have all gone to jail?
[00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.711]  I mean, I'm going to be honest, it wasn't good.
[00:16:30.731 --> 00:16:31.791]  I did.
[00:16:32.332 --> 00:16:34.753]  I wasn't a virgin in high school, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:40.017]  And, you know, the point is, is that I think I always had older girlfriends.
[00:16:40.057 --> 00:16:42.078]  Now, I had one girlfriend that was a year younger than me.
[00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:47.022]  When I was a sophomore, I had a freshman girlfriend.
[00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.369]  But I mean, can you imagine?
[00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:54.252]  And all the time I see it in the Austin paper, I see it in national papers, they report it.
[00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:57.115]  Oh, this 18-year-old was going out with a 16-year-old.
[00:16:57.315 --> 00:16:59.136]  He got her pregnant, he's been arrested!
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:09.866]  And then every time, every time you hear about somebody, the guy who was in Florida who grabbed that girl and tortured her and raped her and killed her,
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.881]  He had been in jail for, what was it, just six, seven years for raping another child?
[00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:17.401]  That guy should have been executed!
[00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:21.282]  What is that human trash doing?
[00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:30.624]  But every time, every time I hear about it, sometimes I read about some degenerate child molester who grabs some five-year-old out of a playground.
[00:17:30.644 --> 00:17:35.125]  If I could get my hands on these people, I'd beat their brains out of them, and that's the feeling I've got towards them.
[00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:36.900]  I mean, you know what?
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.841]  If you put him in the electric chair, I'll pull the lever!
[00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:41.983]  If you've got evidence, you've got proof, they've been convicted, I'll kill them!
[00:17:42.363 --> 00:17:44.145]  I'll go volunteer for firing squads!
[00:17:44.745 --> 00:17:51.229]  And every time, I mean, I've seen some cases where he'd been arrested twelve times for soliciting children or kidnapping them.
[00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.692]  And he'd served prison three times, and then he was released.
[00:17:56.012 --> 00:18:00.996]  But meanwhile, they throw the book at sixteen-year-olds going out with fourteen-year-olds.
[00:18:01.076 --> 00:18:02.857]  Eighteen-year-olds going out with sixteen-year-olds.
[00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:04.158]  Eighteen-year-olds.
[00:18:04.218 --> 00:18:05.679]  In fact, I remember in high school, I had a friend
[00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:20.512]  Who was a couple years older than me, and he graduated, and he had the same girlfriend for like three years, and then he got her pregnant, and he almost got arrested, and his daddy, who had a lot of money, had to spend a bunch of money to just get the police to drop charges of statutory rape against him.
[00:18:23.933 --> 00:18:26.794]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that we face.
[00:18:27.474 --> 00:18:34.535]  Seriously, when you're reading the newspaper, notice every time, I don't think I've ever, I guess I've seen a few cases, but it's almost always
[00:18:35.754 --> 00:18:39.115]  This is the kind of stuff that's been on my mind I haven't gotten to in all the police state news.
[00:18:39.135 --> 00:18:44.117]  Because it's a big, I'm sure you've noticed it's a big debate right now as they try to legitimize all of this.
[00:18:44.497 --> 00:18:52.080]  But almost every time I read about this, it's some demonic pig who's been in jail multiple times for this stuff who does it again!
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:19:02.243]  And if you notice, it's almost always cops, and I mean, I'm sorry folks, and school teachers, and principals, and pastors.
[00:19:05.032 --> 00:19:07.413]  See, that's Predators statistics.
[00:19:07.473 --> 00:19:10.374]  I'm not saying police are all child molesters, a very small percentage.
[00:19:10.414 --> 00:19:14.776]  I'm not saying teachers are all, a very small percentage, but that's where Predators go.
[00:19:15.136 --> 00:19:22.619]  That's why the Founding Fathers said, you've got to limit government, keep it under control, not trust it, give it no rights, constantly surveil it.
[00:19:23.019 --> 00:19:25.060]  You surveil the government and the people are left alone.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.380]  Why?
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:33.563]  Because crooks, nuts, scumbags, control freaks, sadists, gravitate towards power positions.
[00:19:34.537 --> 00:19:36.980]  Wicked people tend to want power!
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.981]  And then when they get it, they abuse it.
[00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:40.643]  Seriously!
[00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:47.770]  It's gotta be... I haven't done a study of it, but it's gotta be like eight times out of ten when I hear about a child molestation bust in the newspaper.
[00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.452]  There's like two of them today, I saw.
[00:19:49.472 --> 00:19:52.154]  I wasn't even looking for these articles, they're just there.
[00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:55.237]  It was, uh, you know, principals and teachers and people.
[00:19:56.038 --> 00:19:59.061]  So government, you're a... just... you're totally evil!

[00:21:07.579 --> 00:21:08.799]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:09.700]  Inflation.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.860]  One and the same.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.582]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.843 --> 00:21:24.964]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:25.224 --> 00:21:27.065]  The bank pays you 1%.
[00:21:27.305 --> 00:21:30.146]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.686 --> 00:21:32.907]  Here is reality.
[00:21:33.287 --> 00:21:36.869]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:37.349 --> 00:21:41.010]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.571 --> 00:21:44.071]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[00:22:01.838 --> 00:22:05.099]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:09.360]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:22:09.601 --> 00:22:12.381]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:14.982]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:22:15.182 --> 00:22:23.825]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:22:24.005 --> 00:22:25.366]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:22:25.546 --> 00:22:29.667]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:22:29.667 --> 00:22:30.368]  We're good to go!

[00:23:52.513 --> 00:23:54.093]  Alright, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:15.794 --> 00:24:17.475]  Getting back to some of the police state news.
[00:24:18.075 --> 00:24:19.676]  Bush says he's about to log in.
[00:24:20.076 --> 00:24:21.697]  Non-paying parents may be tagged.
[00:24:21.817 --> 00:24:22.797]  See, it's going to be for everybody.
[00:24:24.038 --> 00:24:25.878]  Here's a scary one out of Wired Magazine.
[00:24:25.898 --> 00:24:27.739]  I first reported this to you eight years ago.
[00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:28.700]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:37.844]  Oh, nationwide, the feds are paying for software that live time scans all your license plates and it can be used to tax, trace, and give you tickets when you speed.
[00:24:37.884 --> 00:24:40.225]  But mainly for toll roads, who even needs transponders?
[00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:45.187]  These will track you from point to point and then log in your speed, your average speed, everything.
[00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:53.332]  And it says, uh, Washington jealous lovers may soon have an alternative to sniffing for perfume to catch a cheating mate.
[00:24:53.592 --> 00:24:55.013]  Just follow their license plate.
[00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:57.474]  Oh, that's right, private companies are going to integrate it, too.
[00:24:57.954 --> 00:25:05.676]  In recent years, police around the country have started to use powerful infrared cameras to read plates and catch carjackers and ticket scofflaws.
[00:25:06.177 --> 00:25:16.100]  But the technology will soon migrate into the private sector and morph into a tool for tracking individual motorist movements, says former policeman Andy Boklitz.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:22.043]  Who's on the board of Virginia-based G2 Tactics, a manufacturer of the technology.
[00:25:22.463 --> 00:25:24.144]  Now that's only the infrared readers.
[00:25:25.185 --> 00:25:30.208]  They have NSA-type technology of computers that recognize numbers.
[00:25:30.948 --> 00:25:34.130]  And this infrared thing is the old technology.
[00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:38.292]  The stuff that they've really been installing in Indianapolis, Indiana, Austin, Texas.
[00:25:38.312 --> 00:25:39.393]  It's all over Texas now.
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.782]  Or these high-powered big lens cameras that are widescreen.
[00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:45.984]  They don't have to zoom in on each plate.
[00:25:46.545 --> 00:26:04.698]  They are so detailed that they can look at hundreds of plates together in the same frame, in the same field, with moving cars and instantly, instantly, it takes a millisecond, transfer and scan those plates and put those numbers in and track you.
[00:26:06.479 --> 00:26:08.241]  They recognize numbers.
[00:26:10.427 --> 00:26:11.648]  All part of a freedom.
[00:26:11.788 --> 00:26:14.810]  Oh, the NSA isn't spying on the American people.
[00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.651]  We're not violating the Fourth Amendment.
[00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:30.240]  We're just putting face-scanning cameras and biometric cameras that track your walk and brain-scanning systems in five airports and scanning everything and controlling and tracking everything you watch on your digital cable or over your TiVo.
[00:26:30.821 --> 00:26:32.042]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:26:32.082 --> 00:26:33.342]  The government loves you.
[00:26:33.382 --> 00:26:34.523]  We're in a free country.
[00:26:34.543 --> 00:26:37.345]  And we can't stop the terrorists, though they're going to attack.
[00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:39.366]  We've got to take more of your rights.
[00:26:39.466 --> 00:26:40.247]  We're the government.
[00:26:41.428 --> 00:26:43.369]  So this is the type of news I have here in front of me.
[00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:48.591]  And then a really chilling article today from the World Health Organization.
[00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:49.552]  It's their press release.
[00:26:50.272 --> 00:26:57.415]  China immunizes millions of children against Hepatitis B in historic collaboration between government and the GAVI.
[00:26:58.276 --> 00:27:07.360]  The World Health Organization, UNICEF, helping China battle the cause of deadly liver cancer, achieving dramatic increase in delivery of vaccines to most remote provinces.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.861]  Yes, the troublemaking provinces.
[00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:15.388]  And UNICEF is the group that's been caught directly adding the sterilization hormones to tetanus shots worldwide.
[00:27:15.888 --> 00:27:17.889]  They're the folks caught adding cancer viruses.
[00:27:18.229 --> 00:27:25.812]  Of course, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, while openly calling for population reduction, also cares so much about the little children that they help with this too.
[00:27:26.775 --> 00:27:35.680]  It's funny, you got all these... Ted Turner, again, says that we're useless feeders, 85% reduction is needed, but then he gives us money to help vaccinate so you live!
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.081]  Uh-huh!
[00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:43.964]  And then we look at the vaccines that the UN's bringing in, they're killing people and making them sick, but don't put two and two together!
[00:27:44.805 --> 00:27:47.086]  Again, they really care about us.
[00:27:48.391 --> 00:28:03.631]  China has immunized 11.1 million children in its country's poorest and most remote western and central provinces against Hepatitis B, reducing the risk of developing a deadly and common liver cancer, according to an announcement made today by the Chinese government and the GAVI alliance.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:10.101]  Following a ceremony in Beijing held to commend the Chinese for their dramatic progress.
[00:28:10.161 --> 00:28:15.042]  Oh, they get all the big awards for forced sterilization and one-child policy, and they're getting awards for this too.
[00:28:15.282 --> 00:28:16.483]  It's all about population reduction.
[00:28:16.923 --> 00:28:26.005]  The GAVI and Chinese health officials told journalists that the boost in immunizations represents a 60% increase in hepatitis B vaccine doses delivered to children in target provinces.
[00:28:26.345 --> 00:28:31.786]  Notice that in the last 20 years they've radically increased hepatitis B and C inoculations, and it's exploding?
[00:28:32.647 --> 00:28:33.667]  Have you noticed that?
[00:28:33.687 --> 00:28:34.507]  Look at the statistics.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.301]  Take your shots.
[00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:40.964]  And it says they're giving them the full three-dose vaccine series.
[00:28:41.865 --> 00:28:45.368]  Our goal is to protect all the babies at birth from the virus.
[00:28:46.368 --> 00:28:48.670]  I wonder what would happen if we got a private lab to test that.
[00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.211]  I'm sure it'll be like it always is.
[00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:53.654]  Sterilization, chemicals, sterilization hormones, viruses.
[00:28:53.674 --> 00:28:56.956]  Said Chinese Minister of Health Gao Qing.
[00:28:57.236 --> 00:29:00.719]  Again, our goal is to protect all the babies at birth from this virus.
[00:29:01.431 --> 00:29:09.674]  The China GAVI Hepatitis B Immunization Project has propelled us forward on the path covering one-third of all children born in China since the project began in 2002.
[00:29:11.414 --> 00:29:15.776]  It denies a global government paying with your tax money to vaccinate it.
[00:29:15.796 --> 00:29:23.038]  And it goes through how the private foundations are helping too because they care so much about you.
[00:29:25.644 --> 00:29:32.148]  Very same big pharma companies caught knowingly putting AIDS virus in millions of doses of Factor VIII.
[00:29:33.749 --> 00:29:34.249]  Uh-huh.
[00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:36.490]  Just trust them.
[00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.572]  Roll your sleeves up, the government wouldn't hurt you.
[00:29:41.653 --> 00:29:45.615]  You've heard the national newscast, local newscast, Mercury's nutritious.
[00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:48.456]  They don't lie, it's all true.
[00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:49.857]  Don't believe me.
[00:29:51.738 --> 00:29:52.699]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.620]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.612 --> 00:29:58.434]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.138 --> 00:30:09.503]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.884 --> 00:30:14.567]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:14.908 --> 00:30:22.434]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequency.
[00:30:22.874 --> 00:30:29.739]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease condition.
[00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:31.340]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.302]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:35.602 --> 00:30:42.607]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:45.929]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:46.369 --> 00:30:49.673]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.733 --> 00:30:50.093]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:50.254 --> 00:30:50.975]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:01.573 --> 00:31:03.194]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.334 --> 00:31:07.455]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:10.436]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:17.258]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:20.440]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.020]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.722]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:27.782 --> 00:31:28.523]  We're good to go!
[00:31:52.703 --> 00:31:52.803]  808-803-4438.
[00:31:52.863 --> 00:31:53.244]  That's 808-803-4438.
[00:31:53.324 --> 00:31:55.606]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:32:03.503 --> 00:32:05.604]  Hey Bill, I'm buying lunch today.
[00:32:05.944 --> 00:32:06.745]  And check this out.
[00:32:07.065 --> 00:32:07.966]  I bought a new car.
[00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:13.289]  Wow John, I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:17.992]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did and you were right.
[00:32:18.312 --> 00:32:21.735]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week.
[00:32:21.875 --> 00:32:23.216]  Starting with my very first week.
[00:32:23.636 --> 00:32:26.098]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:26.398 --> 00:32:29.760]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.881]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:33.622]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[00:32:33.982 --> 00:32:36.244]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[00:32:36.344 --> 00:32:37.004]  It's incredible!
[00:32:37.384 --> 00:32:44.868]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[00:32:45.188 --> 00:32:50.110]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:50.711 --> 00:32:51.411]  Check, please!
[00:32:51.871 --> 00:32:52.752]  I got this one, Bill.
[00:32:53.152 --> 00:32:53.832]  Sure, John.
[00:32:53.992 --> 00:32:58.595]  Let's tell everyone about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:58.735 --> 00:32:58.995]  Deal.
[00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:07.233]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.914 --> 00:33:14.838]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:26.046]  Wide open phones in this first and second hour, Professor Stephen Jones joins us in the firm with some big new developments on the thermite cutting charges in the World Trade Center towers.
[00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:28.808]  Professor, Doctor, Physicist Stephen Jones.
[00:33:30.652 --> 00:33:32.033]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:32.273 --> 00:33:38.238]  Before I go any further, let me just go ahead and get some of these audio clips out of the way.
[00:33:38.278 --> 00:33:40.119]  Here's a clip from Channel 7 News.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.521]  We have another clip, too.
[00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:43.102]  There's several.
[00:33:44.003 --> 00:33:51.368]  From local TV stations in Denver, where Federal Marshals, Federal Air Marshals, go public themselves and say, look, somebody takes a photo with a camera.
[00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:55.952]  You do anything on a plane, you're put in a terrorist database just because we have quotas.
[00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:58.363]  Now, I've told people this over and over again.
[00:33:58.423 --> 00:33:59.624]  It's not hard to figure out.
[00:33:59.784 --> 00:34:02.327]  I'm not saying, I told you this, I told you that, I'm so smart.
[00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:04.289]  If you know history, you know it repeats.
[00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.154]  In Nazi Germany, in the depths of Soviet Russia under Stalin.
[00:34:09.034 --> 00:34:11.878]  Every week, the local thugs had to put somebody on a list.
[00:34:11.898 --> 00:34:14.260]  Of course, there was no real threat to the Soviet fist.
[00:34:14.701 --> 00:34:15.662]  Everyone was groveling.
[00:34:15.702 --> 00:34:16.503]  Same thing with the Nazis.
[00:34:18.061 --> 00:34:20.342]  Finally got so oppressive it actually did create resistance.
[00:34:20.862 --> 00:34:28.044]  It's the nature of these thugs that they just put anybody and everybody on a list to continue the illusion of a threat and the hysteria.
[00:34:28.304 --> 00:34:43.489]  But even worse than that, local thugs then start ratting on their business competitors, or on people they're jealous of, setting up their own little rackets, their own little shakedown systems with their finger men as they're called.
[00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.231]  You want to live in a hell on earth?
[00:34:46.532 --> 00:34:49.954]  Most of the world has and is, right now, living in a tyranny.
[00:34:50.275 --> 00:34:51.175]  It's humiliating.
[00:34:51.235 --> 00:34:51.896]  It's pathetic.
[00:34:52.497 --> 00:34:56.380]  The good news is, once we go into one, a lot of you are going to wake up.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.482]  A lot of you out there that have been buying the propaganda.
[00:34:59.823 --> 00:35:01.864]  Tyranny has a way of getting you to see straight.
[00:35:02.345 --> 00:35:07.349]  I know a lot of you out there who are neocons and liberals will still go along with it.
[00:35:07.389 --> 00:35:09.851]  You'll decide to convince yourself it's great and try to join it.
[00:35:11.269 --> 00:35:14.972]  And try to get a trusted traveler North American Union ID, which they've now announced.
[00:35:15.732 --> 00:35:17.874]  And you'll be part of the Tattletail Brigade.
[00:35:17.894 --> 00:35:18.815]  You'll enjoy yourself.
[00:35:20.116 --> 00:35:22.257]  But again, that's because you're pathetic scum.
[00:35:23.338 --> 00:35:24.319]  Un-American trash.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:32.966]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the Denver TV News piece concerning the secret police in America.
[00:35:33.026 --> 00:35:33.386]  Here it is.
[00:35:34.972 --> 00:35:40.660]  You could be on a secret government database or watch list for simply taking a picture on an airplane.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.528]  Some federal air marshals say they're reporting your actions to meet a quota, even though some top officials deny it.
[00:35:47.209 --> 00:35:50.994]  7 News Investigator Tony Kovaleski uncovers the quota in tonight's 10-15 Difference.
[00:35:51.576 --> 00:35:56.297]  And those Las Vegas Air Marshals fly all over the country, including right here through Denver.
[00:35:56.577 --> 00:36:02.359]  We're concealing their identities tonight, but they all say they're required to submit at least one report a month.
[00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:07.060]  If they don't, no raise, no bonus, no awards, and no special assignments.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.761]  They call it a quota.
[00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:20.784]  Not only are they making stuff up, but innocent passengers
[00:36:22.617 --> 00:36:33.642]  Are being entered into the International Intelligence Database as suspicious persons acting in a suspicious manner on an aircraft.
[00:36:35.463 --> 00:36:36.463]  And they did nothing wrong?
[00:36:36.723 --> 00:36:38.144]  They did nothing wrong.
[00:36:40.254 --> 00:36:47.798]  Unknowing passengers doing nothing wrong, landing in a secret government document called a surveillance detection report.
[00:36:47.919 --> 00:36:52.141]  But when you see a decision like this for these reports, who loses here?
[00:36:52.461 --> 00:36:55.443]  The people who are supposed to be here to protect the American public.
[00:36:56.053 --> 00:36:58.454]  In government speak, it's called an SDR.
[00:36:58.474 --> 00:37:08.980]  7 News obtained this internal Homeland Security document defining an SDR as a report designed to identify terrorist surveillance activity.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.863]  What kind of impact would it have for a flying individual to be named in an SDR?
[00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:16.744]  That could have serious impact.
[00:37:16.824 --> 00:37:20.106]  Don Strange was the agent in charge of air marshals in Atlanta.
[00:37:20.546 --> 00:37:24.709]  He lost his job attempting to change policies inside the agency.
[00:37:25.969 --> 00:37:40.104]  And that's why several Air Marshals object to this July 2004 memo from top management in the Las Vegas office.
[00:37:40.664 --> 00:37:44.428]  Its subject line reminds Air Marshals of the SDR requirement.
[00:37:44.995 --> 00:37:51.808]  In the body it reads, each Federal Air Marshal is now expected to generate at least one SDR per month.
[00:37:51.848 --> 00:37:56.737]  Does that memo read to you that FAM headquarters has set a quota?
[00:37:57.728 --> 00:37:58.389]  Absolutely.
[00:37:58.769 --> 00:37:59.289]  No doubt.
[00:37:59.589 --> 00:38:09.115]  A second management memo, also dated July 2004, says there may come an occasion when you just don't see anything out of the ordinary for a month at a time.
[00:38:09.575 --> 00:38:12.937]  But I'm sure that if you're looking for it, you'll see something.
[00:38:13.278 --> 00:38:17.300]  Is there a quota in Las Vegas for surveillance detection reports?
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.061]  There is.
[00:38:19.281 --> 00:38:21.643]  And it directly reflects on performance evaluations.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.621]  On how much money you make.
[00:38:23.941 --> 00:38:24.482]  Exactly.
[00:38:24.862 --> 00:38:33.369]  The director of the Air Marshal Service, Dana Brown, declined our request for an interview on the quota system, but the agency points to this memo from August 2004.
[00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:41.256]  It says there is not a quota for submitting SDRs, and it goes on to say, I do not expect reports that are inaccurate or frivolous.
[00:38:41.849 --> 00:38:49.735]  But Las Vegas-based air marshals say the quota system remains in force now more than two years after managers sent the original memos.
[00:38:49.815 --> 00:38:56.440]  To meet this quota, to get their raises, do you think fans in Las Vegas are making some of this stuff up?
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.121]  I know they are.
[00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:58.611]  It's a joke.
[00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:14.803]  One example, according to air marshals, on one flight leaving Las Vegas, an unknowing passenger, most likely a tourist, was identified in an SDR for doing nothing more than taking a photo of the Las Vegas skyline as his plane rolled down the runway.
[00:39:15.043 --> 00:39:20.927]  You're saying that that was not an accurate portrayal of a potential terrorist activity?
[00:39:21.527 --> 00:39:22.008]  No, it was not.
[00:39:22.568 --> 00:39:25.190]  Was a marshal trying to meet a quota?
[00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.051]  Yes, he was.
[00:39:26.707 --> 00:39:29.449]  Did you have a quota in the Atlanta office when you were in charge?
[00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:29.969]  No, I didn't.
[00:39:30.209 --> 00:39:31.170]  Would never have done that.
[00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:39.355]  The former agent in charge of the Atlanta region and other air marshals say the quota allows the government to fill a database with bad information.
[00:39:40.816 --> 00:39:41.636]  Did you play the game?
[00:39:42.276 --> 00:39:44.918]  Did you write an SDR every month?
[00:39:46.339 --> 00:39:46.859]  No, I did not.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:47.860]  Why not?
[00:39:50.341 --> 00:39:53.923]  Well, it's intelligence information.
[00:39:54.824 --> 00:39:56.245]  And like any system.
[00:39:57.453 --> 00:39:59.877]  If you put garbage in, you get garbage out.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:11.155]  I would like to see an investigation, a real investigation, conducted into the way things are done here.
[00:40:14.738 --> 00:40:21.464]  The Director of the Air Marshal Service, Dana Brown, continues to decline our request for an interview to explain the concerns of the Air Marshals.
[00:40:21.844 --> 00:40:34.796]  In a written statement, the Service strongly denies any presence of a quota system, but Las Vegas-based Air Marshals have produced documents that show their performance reviews are directly linked to producing the security detection reports.
[00:40:36.457 --> 00:40:39.320]  Alright, so let me... I wrote some notes while I was listening to that.
[00:40:41.673 --> 00:40:46.757]  Number one, it is meant to create garbage and shatter in the system.
[00:40:46.797 --> 00:41:06.090]  That's why the globalists run, in some cases, over 45 drills simultaneously while they carry out real terror attacks, happens every time, to confuse the rest of the intelligence agencies that are not in the compartmentalized units that are actually carrying out the attacks.
[00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.091]  So it's about
[00:41:09.642 --> 00:41:15.467]  flooding the system with bad chatter and creating reports that can be then used for the public.
[00:41:16.268 --> 00:41:20.491]  And of course not telling us where they got the data showing there's a real terror threat.
[00:41:20.792 --> 00:41:22.133]  So it's multifaceted there.
[00:41:22.673 --> 00:41:26.256]  Also the entire air marshal and airport TSA training system.
[00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:34.203]  Again, I saw Governor Ridge four years ago on television so much in that two hour speech, a discussion I saw him give, you know, came out, he kind of slipped up a bit.
[00:41:35.507 --> 00:41:42.171]  Meanwhile, these CEOs, they say you'll have a Trusted Traveler card, now they admittedly for the North American continent, we now have the documents on that, that's public.
[00:41:43.912 --> 00:42:00.082]  And if you are on a watch list, if you're in any of these databases, bad credit, you'll go from a green level code of Trusted Traveler down to yellow, and then quote, you won't have a Bill of Rights, you won't have due process, because they claim that now they have probable cause.
[00:42:00.102 --> 00:42:04.265]  So it's about getting as many of us as they can on board these systems.
[00:42:05.467 --> 00:42:14.311]  And now we have the TSA slash Viper teams that are Miami, Houston, Texas, you know, out randomly searching people at shopping malls.
[00:42:14.351 --> 00:42:18.433]  Just randomly get up against the wall, we're going to randomly search you and they say it's random.
[00:42:20.734 --> 00:42:29.717]  And I've wondered why in the last few years I'll be on board airplanes shooting video out the window or taking snapshots and a stewardess, a flight attendant, will run over and say, turn that off, it's a regulation.
[00:42:29.757 --> 00:42:30.858]  I'll go, I need to know the regulation.
[00:42:31.573 --> 00:42:38.459]  I've even seen brawny men suddenly get up out of their seats and start walking back when they're going to the bathroom and then loitering by my, you know, where I'm at.
[00:42:38.479 --> 00:42:40.180]  And I just go, look, fine, do what you want.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.881]  I'm going to keep taking video.
[00:42:42.142 --> 00:42:43.242]  I want to see the regulation.
[00:42:44.463 --> 00:42:45.684]  And they'll start freaking out.
[00:42:45.744 --> 00:42:47.005]  This happened when I flew to Canada.
[00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:47.966]  It happened when I flew back.
[00:42:48.987 --> 00:42:53.791]  Because the flight attendants, they all know, quote, that's terrorist mail.
[00:42:54.812 --> 00:42:55.773]  Everything's terrorist!
[00:42:56.033 --> 00:42:56.493]  Everything!
[00:42:56.773 --> 00:42:57.214]  Everything!
[00:42:57.234 --> 00:42:59.656]  You know, when you go out and videotape something, it's terrorism.
[00:42:59.676 --> 00:43:01.257]  But the government can videotape everything they want.
[00:43:02.936 --> 00:43:07.258]  So, this is what they're doing, and so they're training everybody how to be members of the secret police.
[00:43:07.658 --> 00:43:19.742]  There is no real terrorism, but see, as they expand this, it won't just be quotas, now all crime, or political speech, or property rights demonstration, or talk of the Constitution gets you in these lists.
[00:43:19.802 --> 00:43:20.983]  We have all the official documents.
[00:43:21.003 --> 00:43:21.963]  It's in my film, Terror Storm.
[00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:24.424]  So, this is what they're doing.
[00:43:25.484 --> 00:43:29.766]  And this is also set up to get rid of good air marshals.
[00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:41.406]  You know, anybody with half a brain goes, wait a minute, I've got to fill out false reports and put it in a secret terrorist database for anyone that takes a photo of family with their children?
[00:43:41.786 --> 00:43:43.348]  Everybody's got digital cameras?
[00:43:44.669 --> 00:43:48.594]  I've got to put at least one innocent person a month into this thing?
[00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:54.939]  You see, and so that'll get rid of the good people, but the scum that loves to make money, that's how you go up the ranks.
[00:43:55.059 --> 00:43:56.921]  You will put innocent people in databases.
[00:43:57.342 --> 00:43:59.244]  And pretty soon it ends up being like Dallas.
[00:43:59.264 --> 00:44:01.145]  Remember two years ago, the big scandal?
[00:44:01.586 --> 00:44:12.036]  The police would randomly pull over nice vehicles, throw a bag of chalk, a bag of pool cue chalk,
[00:44:14.088 --> 00:44:31.134]  Into the back of the vehicle, powdered, and they would then seize the car, seize their home, not even charge them, and the Dallas Crime Lab certified in every case, or their 15 that went to trial, they said there were hundreds, they would certify it.
[00:44:31.854 --> 00:44:32.774]  Certify it.
[00:44:34.935 --> 00:44:35.995]  And I can go on and on and on.
[00:44:36.015 --> 00:44:41.297]  There's hundreds and hundreds of these documented examples that are in the front page of the paper, but nothing's ever done about it.
[00:44:42.856 --> 00:44:54.645]  Well, they said there were, how many, over 2,000 cases by the time the Houston police chief resigned a few years ago, where they admitted that no one was found innocent by the Houston crime lab.
[00:44:55.145 --> 00:45:00.309]  If someone had been arrested or indicted and the police wanted a conviction, everything was certified.
[00:45:00.409 --> 00:45:03.131]  Blood, DNA, gunpowder residue.
[00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:04.271]  There was no testing.
[00:45:04.512 --> 00:45:06.353]  They would just write up a false report.
[00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:18.817]  But that's how real murderers, not just innocent people go to jail, but that's how real murderers... You always hear about the cases where, let's say a cop's wife gives him antifreeze, and then she kills him, and then she kills another.
[00:45:19.498 --> 00:45:23.460]  And of course, the corrupt crime lab didn't even really test it, because they don't do real testing.
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:28.683]  They just frame who they're told to frame, and if they don't think there's foul play, they don't even do the test.
[00:45:28.723 --> 00:45:31.824]  Because if they did, they wouldn't even do it to begin with, and they'd just certify it.
[00:45:32.745 --> 00:45:34.606]  But the lady that was killing her cop husbands,
[00:45:35.248 --> 00:45:37.389]  One of them was a firefighter, one of them a police officer.
[00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:40.812]  She worked for a judge, so they weren't about to do a test on there.
[00:45:41.852 --> 00:45:43.093]  You see how that works?
[00:45:43.854 --> 00:45:47.436]  So see, that's how my brain works when I assess these things.
[00:45:47.476 --> 00:45:48.717]  I try to look at every angle.
[00:45:49.037 --> 00:45:50.698]  And you start adding it all up.
[00:45:51.299 --> 00:45:54.941]  Why do you think our government hired General Primakov four years ago?
[00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:57.543]  The former head of the KGB.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.602]  When I first saw this in alternative press, I didn't believe it.
[00:46:02.863 --> 00:46:04.244]  Then I saw it in mainstream news.
[00:46:04.284 --> 00:46:05.645]  Then I made phone calls.
[00:46:06.026 --> 00:46:14.194]  I found out, I went and found the actual funding in Congress that our government really hired the head of the KGB.
[00:46:15.595 --> 00:46:18.097]  Really hired the head of the KGB!
[00:46:18.178 --> 00:46:19.439]  It's really happening!
[00:46:21.341 --> 00:46:22.161]  And then it got worse.
[00:46:22.201 --> 00:46:24.584]  They hired on a 1.3 million dollar consulting
[00:46:25.489 --> 00:46:28.590]  Deal in 2003, Marcus Wolf.
[00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.271]  Do you know who Marcus Wolf is?
[00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:37.853]  He was the famous 20 plus year head of the East German Stasi.
[00:46:37.873 --> 00:46:45.116]  And if you have trouble believing that, you can go pull up the documents in the news articles, but remember how we hired all the Nazis.
[00:46:45.156 --> 00:46:46.977]  I mean, it's just the same thing over and over again.
[00:46:48.497 --> 00:46:53.779]  So they're taking the experts on how to do this, and how to create a surveillance tattletale society, and they're hiring them.
[00:46:54.782 --> 00:47:00.124]  And now somebody walks in a store with an anti-George Bush shirt, they're arrested.
[00:47:00.144 --> 00:47:01.224]  You go in a mall, you're arrested.
[00:47:01.564 --> 00:47:09.267]  You go to the VFW for medical care, you're wearing a Veterans for Peace with just a dove on it, you get grabbed and thrown out and detained and threatened with arrest.
[00:47:09.747 --> 00:47:11.228]  This is the new America!
[00:47:12.308 --> 00:47:13.428]  Those are the confirmed cases.
[00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:20.531]  We get all the calls where an old man goes in with his hand half-lobbed off, and he walks in and he's got an InfoWars.com bumper sticker and the
[00:47:22.207 --> 00:47:31.550]  See, a lot of people are cowardly scum and they know it's tyranny.
[00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:40.672]  Some people in the government, in the media, and in the general population, in private industry, in service, they don't...
[00:47:41.545 --> 00:47:44.908]  They're not stupid, they're evil, and they've decided to serve the evil.
[00:47:45.228 --> 00:47:49.831]  Or, they're just so cowardly, they're afraid, and they've decided to serve the evil.
[00:47:50.232 --> 00:47:55.596]  And this is how you go from an upright, strong, chin sticking out, chest out,
[00:47:56.476 --> 00:47:57.397]  We're steely-eyed.
[00:47:57.717 --> 00:47:58.898]  Everybody's afraid of us.
[00:47:58.978 --> 00:48:00.059]  We're admired.
[00:48:00.099 --> 00:48:00.679]  We're tough.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.201]  We don't put up with nothing!
[00:48:02.401 --> 00:48:03.602]  We're Americans!
[00:48:04.002 --> 00:48:15.612]  The government's afraid of the people like it should be to a bunch of cowering, ninnying people with Power of Pride stickers and plastic Chinese-made American flags flapping all over your cars.
[00:48:15.872 --> 00:48:17.934]  When that isn't patriotism, you scum!
[00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.881]  I'm going to tell the Air Marshal something.
[00:48:25.001 --> 00:48:28.443]  Of course you're supposed to put all the innocent people in databases!
[00:48:30.385 --> 00:48:32.406]  Your bosses carried out 9-11!
[00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:33.627]  You work for the terrorists!
[00:48:33.867 --> 00:48:35.468]  You're not there to protect anybody!
[00:48:35.628 --> 00:48:37.110]  Your whole industry is a joke!
[00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:49.839]  The federal documents say you're there to be trained in search and seizure as secret police on the airplanes and in the airports to then go nationwide and I've been telling you that for four years and now it's main screen news!
[00:48:50.706 --> 00:48:52.127]  Searching people on the subways.
[00:48:52.427 --> 00:48:53.608]  Searching people on the streets.
[00:48:53.968 --> 00:48:55.469]  Searching people in shopping malls.
[00:48:55.649 --> 00:49:01.752]  The FBI said they want metal detectors like at the airports when you go in the shopping malls, Associated Press, two years ago.
[00:49:04.594 --> 00:49:18.321]  And when the CIA, or the Mossad, or Shin Bet, or MI6, or the Russians blow a bunch of stuff up over here, for the globalists, whenever that next wave happens, they're going to start implementing even more of this, and there'll be even more attacks.
[00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:21.191]  Do you understand?
[00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:24.493]  Terrorists attacked us on 9-11!
[00:49:24.693 --> 00:49:30.617]  The terrorists are in control of Homeland Security and the FBI and the entire country!
[00:49:31.497 --> 00:49:35.700]  They're hiring the heads of the KGB and the Stasi!
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.481]  Do you read me?
[00:49:37.782 --> 00:49:38.902]  Do you get it?
[00:49:39.162 --> 00:49:40.623]  Does it compute?
[00:49:42.305 --> 00:49:45.847]  And you can roll over and be afraid of this or you can get mad!
[00:49:48.214 --> 00:49:51.075]  You can get a fire in your eyes and a fire in your belly.
[00:49:52.815 --> 00:49:58.736]  You can tell these murder and trash that killed almost 3,000 people on 9-11, and we're not going along with it.
[00:49:58.916 --> 00:50:16.179]  And there's a lot of special forces, and a lot of FBI, and a lot of air marshals, and a lot of border patrol, and a lot of sheriff's deputies, and a lot of state police, and a lot of beat cops, who I know, and people I talk to, and the emails and the calls we get, and they're starting to wake up, criminals, and you're in a lot of trouble!
[00:50:19.511 --> 00:50:21.453]  You're going down, New World Order!
[00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:27.918]  You can kill, and you can set up, and you can do whatever you want to some of us.
[00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:30.040]  You can audit us, you can pull all your trash.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.100]  Some of us aren't afraid.
[00:50:31.381 --> 00:50:32.742]  Some of us are going to defend the people.
[00:50:32.982 --> 00:50:35.444]  Some of us are going to stand up, but you can't get all of us.
[00:50:38.967 --> 00:50:40.168]  We're coming for you!
[00:50:40.628 --> 00:50:41.569]  I hope you know it!
[00:50:44.338 --> 00:50:46.020]  For those who say, hey Alex, don't get so upset.
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:51.788]  You're supposed to get upset about a government that's carrying out terror attacks and putting innocent families on terror list.
[00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:55.693]  We'll be right back with your calls on the other side.
[00:50:55.713 --> 00:50:58.977]  Full hour of calls next hour and two more audio clips.
[00:50:59.017 --> 00:50:59.478]  Stay with me.
[00:51:04.591 --> 00:51:05.071]  It's here!
[00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:10.012]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.432 --> 00:51:18.094]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.754 --> 00:51:25.795]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:33.077]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:51:33.587 --> 00:51:37.690]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.433]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.913 --> 00:51:43.834]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.175 --> 00:51:48.077]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.511 --> 00:52:06.736]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:52:06.876 --> 00:52:14.985]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:52:15.225 --> 00:52:22.292]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:52:23.233 --> 00:52:29.718]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:52:29.898 --> 00:52:34.982]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:35.102 --> 00:52:43.990]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:47.552]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:52:49.634 --> 00:52:54.356]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:56.297 --> 00:52:59.078]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:59.278 --> 00:53:08.501]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.721 --> 00:53:10.982]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.182 --> 00:53:17.525]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.865 --> 00:53:18.525]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:50.481]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:56.605]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:05.853 --> 00:54:16.902]  By the way, we've got an opportunity to expose the man who wrote the memo saying they can torture people to death, and whose deputy said they can torture small children sexually in front of their parents.
[00:54:17.958 --> 00:54:22.460]  And that's Alberto Gonzales, the criminal attorney general this nation has running it.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.701]  A monster.
[00:54:24.581 --> 00:54:31.264]  Alberto Gonzales will be on C-SPAN Washington Journal at 9 a.m.
[00:54:31.605 --> 00:54:34.566]  Eastern Time tomorrow morning.
[00:54:35.386 --> 00:54:40.509]  You can call in to C-SPAN Journal and stand up against Alberto R. Gonzales.
[00:54:40.529 --> 00:54:42.210]  You better believe they're going to be screening calls.
[00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:47.252]  You'll have to infiltrate them and give them baloney to get through to him.
[00:54:48.107 --> 00:55:04.938]  And C-SPAN has not yet, you know, they just kind of put us off last week and said, oh, we think this Sunday coming up that the, you know, we think coming up this Sunday at 8 o'clock it's, you know, the 9-11 Symposium is going to be airing there, but we're not sure.
[00:55:04.998 --> 00:55:06.018]  It might be a week later.
[00:55:07.819 --> 00:55:11.021]  So just call in on those live shows on Washington Journal and bring it up.
[00:55:11.562 --> 00:55:15.124]  But here's your chance to call in to Alberto Gonzalez, a monster!
[00:55:16.405 --> 00:55:19.487]  Just a monstrous former Enron lawyer, of course.
[00:55:19.507 --> 00:55:22.568]  We're in so much trouble, folks.
[00:55:22.608 --> 00:55:25.650]  These are hardcore, hardcore crooks.
[00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.852]  And they're in control right now.
[00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:32.954]  Let's go to Tim in New York, then Tony, Zach, David, Joe, and others.
[00:55:32.974 --> 00:55:33.774]  Go ahead, Tim.
[00:55:34.955 --> 00:55:36.376]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:55:36.436 --> 00:55:44.320]  Wanted to let you know that in the latest edition of Popular Mechanics, they have spawned of Osprey, a remotely guided vehicle.
[00:55:44.932 --> 00:55:50.355]  They can see the decals on license plates from 12,000 feet in all weather.
[00:55:50.836 --> 00:55:55.278]  My question is, how many decals on license plates are there in Iraq or Afghanistan?
[00:55:56.239 --> 00:55:57.179]  Well, there aren't, sir.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:57.860]  There aren't, sir.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.901]  Yeah, this is obviously for the United States.
[00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:01.382]  Oh, they've already got them up all over.
[00:56:01.462 --> 00:56:02.743]  Texas, California, New York.
[00:56:03.423 --> 00:56:04.404]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:04.704 --> 00:56:06.785]  So it's just one more... Can't put them on the border!
[00:56:07.005 --> 00:56:08.066]  Can't put them on the border, though.
[00:56:08.678 --> 00:56:09.359]  Oh, not at all.
[00:56:09.519 --> 00:56:17.746]  And just to let you know, tonight in Rochester, New York, at the Little Theater, we're showing 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, 5-30 tonight.
[00:56:17.806 --> 00:56:20.348]  That's in Rochester, New York.
[00:56:20.408 --> 00:56:23.731]  This is the third movie we've put on, and we're going to keep doing it.
[00:56:23.751 --> 00:56:26.033]  We're going to show a lot of your stuff and everybody else's.
[00:56:26.113 --> 00:56:26.774]  All right, Tim.
[00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:27.394]  Good job.
[00:56:27.694 --> 00:56:28.435]  Good to hear from you.
[00:56:28.475 --> 00:56:30.216]  Tony in Toronto, Canada.
[00:56:30.257 --> 00:56:30.817]  Go ahead, Tony.
[00:56:30.837 --> 00:56:32.719]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:56:32.779 --> 00:56:33.619]  Thank you for my call.
[00:56:34.969 --> 00:56:38.652]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about what's going on over there in Lebanon.
[00:56:38.672 --> 00:56:53.604]  I don't know if you saw the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbor, on CNN basically saying that the Israeli government is going to be held for war crimes and it could be personal all the way up to the very top.
[00:56:54.065 --> 00:56:55.226]  Well, they always say that.
[00:56:55.266 --> 00:56:56.567]  It's more smoke and mirrors.
[00:56:57.548 --> 00:57:00.690]  And I guarantee you that there won't be war crimes charges if the U.S.
[00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.732]  is hit by an evil terrorist.
[00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:17.390]  I understand that, but you know, then Bolton gets on there in CNN, and he says, you know, she better watch her language, like basically threatening her, right on national television, and same with our ambassador to Israel, Alan Baker.
[00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:26.873]  Anyways, I go in to see my Member of Parliament, and he lets me listen to his voicemail that when he called into the Toronto Star,
[00:57:27.674 --> 00:57:34.018]  On his interview, they edited out everything he had to say that was basically critical of Israel.
[00:57:34.338 --> 00:57:35.119]  That's how they do it!
[00:57:35.379 --> 00:57:46.266]  Yeah, and he had to basically shame our Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs to come out of hiding when all our citizens were stranded in Lebanon.
[00:57:46.326 --> 00:57:47.686]  There's still all kinds of them there.
[00:57:48.087 --> 00:57:51.008]  Hey, what do you think of Canada, England, the U.S.
[00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:54.971]  and others putting, because it isn't just our country, everybody in terrorist databases?
[00:57:56.024 --> 00:57:58.765]  Well, as far as the course, it doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:58:00.446 --> 00:58:01.547]  My wife's from Indonesia.
[00:58:01.567 --> 00:58:05.028]  I used to hear my phone click all the time, and the tone changed.
[00:58:05.068 --> 00:58:07.589]  They were listening to my phone conversation, for sure.
[00:58:07.629 --> 00:58:12.331]  I mean, the police state stuff is just so pervasive.
[00:58:12.571 --> 00:58:17.113]  And the police state's there to make sure the criminal operations of the New World Order go unmolested.
[00:58:17.134 --> 00:58:18.054]  Appreciate the call.
[00:58:19.321 --> 00:58:22.423]  Second hour, 70 seconds away, and we hit this break.
[00:58:22.463 --> 00:58:23.784]  My new film Terror Storm's out.
[00:58:23.824 --> 00:58:33.051]  Visit InfoWars.com online video and bookstore today and secure your copy of my new film that exposes the murdering terrorist unlike any other film you'll ever see.
[00:58:33.411 --> 00:58:34.652]  This is my crowning achievement.

[00:58:37.454 --> 00:58:38.955]  Second hour, straight ahead!
[00:58:41.297 --> 00:58:46.180]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:58.350]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:00.071]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:01.892]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.532 --> 00:59:03.352]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.113 --> 00:59:05.053]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.033 --> 00:59:09.355]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.855 --> 00:59:13.977]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:18.139]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:18.519 --> 00:59:22.521]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:59:23.424 --> 00:59:31.240]  Savagely attacking the New World Order criminals Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:31.832 --> 00:59:38.057]  Professor Stephen E. Jones, the new developments on bombs inside the World Trade Center complex buildings, joining us in the third hour.
[00:59:38.377 --> 00:59:46.103]  This hour, wide open phones, a bunch of clips from what's happening over in Israel, the white phosphorus bombs, the rest of it, tons of police state news.
[00:59:46.503 --> 00:59:47.924]  You'll definitely want to stay with us.
[00:59:48.305 --> 00:59:50.226]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[00:59:50.466 --> 00:59:52.588]  Zach in New York, you're on the air.
[00:59:52.808 --> 00:59:53.088]  Hello.
[00:59:53.509 --> 00:59:53.729]  Hi.
[00:59:54.209 --> 01:00:00.934]  I haven't gotten all 40 of my childhood vaccinations, and before I became familiar with some of your information,
[01:00:01.952 --> 01:00:04.974]  Traveled internationally and got basically all the suggested vaccinations.
[01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:09.297]  I was wondering if you would imagine I have a time bomb inside myself.
[01:00:09.698 --> 01:00:16.523]  Absolutely, but your body is able to fend off with its immune system a lot of that stuff if you get healthy while you're young.
[01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:21.186]  All the studies show it's the over and over and over again just from the mercury alone.
[01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:24.128]  So staying away from those will definitely help you.
[01:00:25.009 --> 01:00:26.970]  And how about fluoride toothpaste?
[01:00:27.031 --> 01:00:27.571]  Is that unwise?
[01:00:28.706 --> 01:00:34.651]  Well, I mean, fluoride toothpaste on the back says if you swallow more than a pea-sized amount of this, call poison control immediately.
[01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.072]  It's a deadly poison.
[01:00:36.953 --> 01:00:38.374]  So, I don't know what to say.
[01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.616]  I mean, you don't eat rat poison.
[01:00:41.516 --> 01:00:44.499]  Why would you then use fluoride toothpaste?
[01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:46.080]  I guess I'll start jogging then.
[01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:46.380]  Thank you.
[01:00:46.901 --> 01:00:47.241]  Thank you.
[01:00:47.281 --> 01:00:48.382]  I appreciate your call.
[01:00:49.162 --> 01:00:50.944]  Let's go ahead and talk to David and Mass.
[01:00:50.964 --> 01:00:51.825]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:00:52.825 --> 01:00:53.706]  Alex, how are you today?
[01:00:53.766 --> 01:00:54.006]  Good.
[01:00:54.807 --> 01:00:57.349]  Listen, I missed the last segment a little bit.
[01:00:58.152 --> 01:01:02.895]  About the databases that were being filed, the SDRs.
[01:01:02.995 --> 01:01:03.836]  What does that stand for?
[01:01:03.856 --> 01:01:06.357]  Oh, I only dig the article out.
[01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:08.659]  It's these suspicious... Suspicious?
[01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:12.201]  A database system.
[01:01:12.721 --> 01:01:13.862]  Database, your report.
[01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:15.843]  Okay, well, here's a good one for you.
[01:01:16.384 --> 01:01:21.647]  Last week, I don't know if you saw this article from MSN Money, Why Your Bank Thinks You're a Terrorist.
[01:01:23.969 --> 01:01:42.511]  Uh, issuing suspicious activity reports, SARS, on people doing... Remember five years ago they couldn't get the Know Your Customer Act passed, but now when you get a bank account they make you sign your rights over, and then basically everything's being reported on against you.
[01:01:43.112 --> 01:01:43.552]  That's right.
[01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:50.574]  Anything that is supposedly out of the ordinary financial transaction-wise is being uploaded to these databases.
[01:01:50.614 --> 01:01:52.435]  Which I thought we had a Fourth Amendment again.
[01:01:52.735 --> 01:01:54.676]  Face scanning cameras, violates Fourth Amendment.
[01:01:55.376 --> 01:01:58.557]  These know-your-customers suspicious transaction reports.
[01:01:59.017 --> 01:02:00.758]  Same thing over and over again.
[01:02:01.258 --> 01:02:01.718]  That's right.
[01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:06.460]  And these are also connected to Patriot 2's Anti-Money Laundering Act.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:06.880]  Yes.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.941]  And those... I'm sure you know, Alex, that
[01:02:12.317 --> 01:02:22.259]  All these countries that have signed on to the anti-money laundering provisions of the Patriot Act, a lot of countries, a lot of the EU countries... It's about stopping your money going overseas.
[01:02:22.519 --> 01:02:28.380]  That's right, and it is amazing to think how much power that this has.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:38.682]  If you think you're going to get your assets out, and even expatriate, and go to any other country, if they're on these anti-money laundering provisions,
[01:02:39.662 --> 01:02:44.804]  The Secret Service or any part of the government can come and seize those assets.
[01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:48.565]  And that's all without due process and selectively enforced?
[01:02:49.145 --> 01:02:49.285]  None.
[01:02:49.305 --> 01:02:52.286]  Of course, the people running our government are a bunch of drug dealers themselves.
[01:02:52.946 --> 01:02:55.147]  Absolutely, and there's no protection on it.
[01:02:55.187 --> 01:02:56.687]  I think the only... Sir, sir, sir!
[01:02:57.067 --> 01:03:00.388]  Imagine giving the Mafia a blank check to run things.
[01:03:00.428 --> 01:03:01.369]  What would the Mafia do?
[01:03:01.389 --> 01:03:02.229]  They're doing it right now.
[01:03:03.129 --> 01:03:04.850]  That's right, and guess what, Alex?
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:05.550]  There's a new
[01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:09.212]  Acronym in Homeland Security parlance.
[01:03:09.372 --> 01:03:10.513]  I don't know if you're aware of it.
[01:03:11.093 --> 01:03:11.693]  It's called CILF.
[01:03:11.873 --> 01:03:15.075]  Civilian Inmate Labor Facility.
[01:03:16.955 --> 01:03:18.576]  That's in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:03:18.936 --> 01:03:22.178]  We have official army documents from the army.mil website.
[01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:25.979]  Where secretly since 86, Americans have been on camps.
[01:03:26.419 --> 01:03:29.821]  And they declassified it in 96 and radically expanded it.
[01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:31.702]  We're all heading into them.
[01:03:32.862 --> 01:03:34.003]  Well, it's for your safety, sir.
[01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:34.803]  To fight Al Qaeda.
[01:03:35.948 --> 01:03:37.030]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:39.032]  Great points that you brought up, sir.
[01:03:39.132 --> 01:03:39.833]  Excellent points.
[01:03:41.355 --> 01:03:43.118]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:03:43.238 --> 01:03:48.185]  Yeah, in my book The Sin of Tyranny and my film Road to Tyranny, we show the army.mil website.
[01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.888]  They kept the camp secret for 10 years.
[01:03:50.968 --> 01:03:52.070]  People were in them, by the way.
[01:03:56.474 --> 01:03:59.656]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.997 --> 01:04:01.938]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.298 --> 01:04:09.964]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.644 --> 01:04:17.689]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.089 --> 01:04:24.554]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:29.544]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:33.307]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:35.709]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:39.973]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.954 --> 01:05:03.024]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.285 --> 01:05:12.295]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.496]  Into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.836 --> 01:05:20.557]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.797 --> 01:05:27.419]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.659 --> 01:05:34.480]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.521]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:36.781 --> 01:05:38.842]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[01:06:53.489 --> 01:06:59.151]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:06.553]  There's six and a half billion people in the world and growing.
[01:07:07.634 --> 01:07:11.555]  They call us human resources and there's no commodity that's more cheap to the elite.
[01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.676]  Human life means nothing to them.
[01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:18.077]  And some people have trouble believing that the globalists
[01:07:18.607 --> 01:07:30.757]  We'd carry out 9-11 and kill 2,800 and something people as a pretext to build a new war economy of domestic oppression and police state and international global domination and control.
[01:07:31.157 --> 01:07:35.501]  Now, we're going to be taking more of your calls.
[01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:40.184]  I have several audio clips that I want to air as well.
[01:07:41.005 --> 01:07:45.909]  And so before we go to Joe and Andrew and Andy and Jim and Robert and many others,
[01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:47.518]  that are patiently holding.
[01:07:47.578 --> 01:07:53.862]  I wanted to get into some of the news concerning what's happening in Israel right now.
[01:07:54.523 --> 01:08:08.012]  We were getting reports on Thursday when Israel began to tell villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate that they were bombing the bridges ahead of them so they couldn't escape and then bombing their convoys and the deaths were way over 400 even last week.
[01:08:08.032 --> 01:08:09.433]  We're just now hearing they're over 400.
[01:08:09.913 --> 01:08:11.274]  Apartment buildings being leveled.
[01:08:11.314 --> 01:08:12.595]  Peaceful targets being hit.
[01:08:13.676 --> 01:08:14.717]  Very, very serious
[01:08:16.557 --> 01:08:21.559]  And now the mainstream news has been forced to report on that and to admit that.
[01:08:22.079 --> 01:08:23.479]  So here's an ITN piece.
[01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:26.820]  I wish you could see the video, but in a way it's better that you don't.
[01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.161]  But it's up on Infowars.com if you want to go watch it.
[01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:31.402]  Burned toddlers and little children.
[01:08:31.422 --> 01:08:36.023]  And this is them just focusing in on one family and one bombed car.
[01:08:36.823 --> 01:08:39.084]  The roadsides are just littered.
[01:08:39.961 --> 01:08:42.642]  With these and the Apaches and the Jets come in.
[01:08:42.682 --> 01:08:48.284]  They clearly see that it's you know trucks and cars packed with people and they kill whole families.
[01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.985]  Here are some of the survivors.
[01:08:51.025 --> 01:08:52.186]  Go ahead and roll that piece.
[01:08:53.114 --> 01:08:54.675]  We're down in southern Lebanon.
[01:08:54.735 --> 01:09:03.878]  It's been an extremely frightening, tense and exhausting situation for so many, many people trying to either stay in place or flee their homes.
[01:09:03.918 --> 01:09:08.220]  The Israelis have been saying to many, many civilians in south Lebanon, get out.
[01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:13.522]  But the problem being, many of them can't get out because the roads and bridges have been blown out.
[01:09:13.583 --> 01:09:17.304]  Carl Penhall has been there and let me tell you, some of these pictures are disturbing.
[01:09:17.784 --> 01:09:18.565]  Please be aware.
[01:09:18.585 --> 01:09:19.365]  This is his report.
[01:09:26.644 --> 01:09:29.527]  His Bula rockets soar toward Israel.
[01:09:36.453 --> 01:09:39.296]  Minutes later, the response from Israeli jets.
[01:09:41.298 --> 01:09:43.860]  There were tit-for-tat strikes throughout Sunday.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.862]  Yeah, can you guys roll on this too, please?
[01:09:46.402 --> 01:09:51.527]  Earlier in the day, smoke billowed over tires' outskirts after another Israeli bombardment.
[01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:55.293]  The target apparently, this car.
[01:09:55.773 --> 01:09:57.735]  It was still smouldering when we arrived.
[01:09:58.436 --> 01:10:03.180]  Just yards away in the hospital, more civilian casualties maimed in airstrikes.
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.384]  In a war where neither side seems to be pinpointing its attacks.
[01:10:10.746 --> 01:10:11.928]  The sobs of a mother.
[01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.331]  The cry of her baby daughter.
[01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:20.215]  And the scream of her son.
[01:10:23.533 --> 01:10:26.996]  Through her tears, Nuhada Mansour sends a plea to Allah.
[01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:31.219]  Medics have just told her that her husband, Mohammed, was killed.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:38.966]  Her 9-year-old son, Mahmoud, is so badly burned he can't open his eyes, and doctors say he's hallucinating.
[01:10:39.947 --> 01:10:45.531]  Dr. Wahid Najjar claims the Israelis have packed their bombs with chemicals to burn their victims.
[01:10:45.972 --> 01:10:48.254]  This is the effect of phosphorus.
[01:10:48.574 --> 01:10:49.655]  This is phosphorus, of course.
[01:10:50.722 --> 01:10:55.047]  International rules of war forbid the use of weapons that cause indiscriminate suffering.
[01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:59.312]  There's no specific reference, though, to phosphorus.
[01:10:59.352 --> 01:11:05.979]  The Israeli Defense Forces say its weapons and ammunition conform to international law.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.086]  I'm unable to get independent confirmation of Najia's allegation, but it's a widely held view here.
[01:11:13.447 --> 01:11:17.950]  There's a smell of phosphorus and the wound is black and it smells, he tells me.
[01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:20.591]  It's really an atrocious war.
[01:11:20.891 --> 01:11:23.193]  Only the civilians are suffering, he says.
[01:11:23.593 --> 01:11:32.039]  This is another vehicle that was apparently hit in the same airstrike, but the vehicle that the Mansour family were traveling in is a few hundred yards down this road.
[01:11:32.339 --> 01:11:38.623]  But we can hear Israeli warplanes buzzing overhead right now, so it may be a little too dangerous to travel down there.
[01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:45.029]  Doctors tell me the Mansoor family has been trying to drive into Tyre to escape bombing close to their village.
[01:11:46.589 --> 01:11:52.170]  When I return to the hospital ward, Nuhada Mansoor is helping tend to her eight-month-old baby.
[01:11:53.231 --> 01:11:57.031]  She's dropped off to sleep for a few moments, sucking on her pacifier.
[01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:00.712]  Doctors say Maria and brother Mahmood will survive.
[01:12:00.732 --> 01:12:05.733]  But they may be scarred for life.
[01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:13.084]  We've got clip after clip just like this and reports of just minivans with just dead people everywhere.
[01:12:13.104 --> 01:12:14.205]  Whole families, children, toddlers splattered.
[01:12:29.938 --> 01:12:33.821]  And then our media goes, Israel laughingly doesn't target civilians and tells them to flee.
[01:12:34.262 --> 01:12:36.063]  Oh, Israel is so good and helpful.
[01:12:36.123 --> 01:12:37.585]  Oh, I love you all.
[01:12:38.085 --> 01:12:39.586]  And then this is what's really going on.
[01:12:41.047 --> 01:12:42.329]  Fresh memories of war.
[01:12:42.369 --> 01:12:42.989]  I thought I'd go back.
[01:12:43.029 --> 01:12:51.216]  Remember the Associated Press where a bunch of soldiers, an ongoing public saying, and this is Associated Press, that they were ordered to kill all military age men?
[01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:55.440]  Well, this was out of the Ithaca Journal back in May 25, 2002.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.200]  We did dig this out.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:56.581]  We did find it.
[01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:05.937]  Fresh memories of war, soldiers prepare for their second mission in the Bagram military base in eastern Afghanistan.
[01:13:07.198 --> 01:13:12.764]  The stench of decaying flesh hung heavy in the air as soldiers passed blown-up bunkers and caves.
[01:13:12.824 --> 01:13:21.774]  As they stood down in an L-shaped corridor, the stiffened limbs of a Taliban soldier jutted from beneath piles of rock and dust in the sweltering afternoon air.
[01:13:22.469 --> 01:13:29.713]  Ripped-up pages from the Koran and booklets describing ways to kill Americans littered the treeline valley that had been bombarded by U.S.
[01:13:29.793 --> 01:13:31.574]  airstrikes before their arrival.
[01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:46.902]  These recollections, marked by the intensity of every hour of every day, felt in combat to vivify memories that resurface for veterans of World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and the First Gulf War, and other military combat this Memorial Day weekend.
[01:13:48.542 --> 01:14:02.880]  It goes on, for Army Private Matt Gruckheimer, who recently returned home to Topkins County after two missions in eastern Afghanistan, processing his memories and readjusting to American life had just begun.
[01:14:03.875 --> 01:14:14.770]  Gruckheimer, who helped clear the L-shaped valley near the border of Pakistan, who twists and turns and burned into his memory, explained the nature of his company's mission.
[01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:18.135]  In doing so, he spoke candidly about the reality of war.
[01:14:18.155 --> 01:14:20.599]  In an April interview with the Ithaca Journal,
[01:14:21.119 --> 01:14:28.164]  At his family's Heights home, Gruckheimer 22 shared his experiences during Operation Ataconda.
[01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:36.770]  He was sent on March 6 in a company of more than a hundred soldiers to participate in the largest U.S.-led ground engagement in eastern Afghanistan.
[01:14:37.231 --> 01:14:45.837]  We were told there were no friendly forces, said Gruckheimer, an assistant gunner with the 10th Mountain Division Fort Drum, quote, if there was anybody there, they were the enemy.
[01:14:45.877 --> 01:14:50.420]  We were told specifically that there were women and children to kill them, close quote.
[01:14:52.506 --> 01:14:56.151]  Well, isn't that nice?
[01:14:56.831 --> 01:15:05.182]  And then the Army, the Pentagon, came out and clarified three days after this report came out, and didn't even deny it, and said, well, we have a clarification.
[01:15:05.222 --> 01:15:08.786]  Yes, in certain areas, where we know there are combatants, we say kill everyone.
[01:15:11.129 --> 01:15:11.970]  So I don't want to hear it.
[01:15:12.817 --> 01:15:18.460]  And if we're going to be charging soldiers for following orders, which these are criminal orders, they should be charged.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:28.165]  Even if Hitler says go blow that person's head off who's innocent, they'll stomp that child's brains out if Heinrich Himmler's SS officers tell you that you should go to prison or be executed if you follow orders.
[01:15:28.306 --> 01:15:32.628]  But, what about the people who gave the orders?
[01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:37.991]  It's like Abu Ghraib and all those other twenty-something camps.
[01:15:40.171 --> 01:15:46.313]  It's admitted, I mean, they write memos saying they can torture people to death, and then no one gets in trouble when they give the orders.
[01:15:48.494 --> 01:15:50.495]  Only the people that get caught carrying it out.
[01:15:53.856 --> 01:15:55.296]  This is mind-blowing.
[01:15:55.317 --> 01:16:04.880]  We need to write an article about this, concerning the mass murder, the orders, the evidence that troops have been ordered to kill men, women, and children.
[01:16:06.255 --> 01:16:16.021]  And I know Talk Radio, Neocon Talk Radio has taught everybody that, Krasnoyarsk Radio has taught everybody that it's good to kill all the Arabs, kill their babies, kill their women, kill them all.
[01:16:19.063 --> 01:16:20.124]  What have we turned into?
[01:16:20.244 --> 01:16:21.245]  What have we become?
[01:16:22.385 --> 01:16:23.166]  What have we become?
[01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:29.210]  And the average zombie who's out there pushing this line, the average supporter of all of
[01:16:31.855 --> 01:16:36.598]  Generally, he's a hard-working person who pays their taxes and probably even believes in the Second Amendment.
[01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:38.940]  They're just totally brain-dead.
[01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:42.842]  They just don't know anything about the Middle East.
[01:16:42.862 --> 01:16:44.063]  They don't know anything about the history.
[01:16:44.383 --> 01:16:45.484]  They don't know what's happening.
[01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:47.385]  They think 9-11 was carried out by Arabs.
[01:16:47.405 --> 01:16:48.746]  They think it was carried out by Saddam.
[01:16:49.246 --> 01:16:50.327]  And they're really hard to reach.
[01:16:50.367 --> 01:16:51.247]  They feel good.
[01:16:51.288 --> 01:16:52.768]  They're like religious zealots.
[01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:53.489]  It's a religion.
[01:16:56.727 --> 01:16:58.268]  They don't believe Bush is anti-gun.
[01:16:58.288 --> 01:16:59.589]  They don't know he's getting rid of the borders.
[01:16:59.609 --> 01:17:01.230]  They don't know he's signing the American Union.
[01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.811]  He has signed it.
[01:17:01.831 --> 01:17:03.051]  They just can't get it.
[01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:04.272]  And they are not going to get it.
[01:17:05.613 --> 01:17:06.974]  And we don't need to convince them.
[01:17:07.494 --> 01:17:10.697]  Folks, 5% started the war and won the war against the British.
[01:17:10.737 --> 01:17:10.857]  It was 5%.
[01:17:10.977 --> 01:17:14.699]  I studied the Revolutionary War.
[01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:18.202]  You'll hear someone say a third fought it.
[01:17:18.622 --> 01:17:19.443]  That's not true.
[01:17:19.663 --> 01:17:21.104]  It's 5% were actual combatants.
[01:17:21.584 --> 01:17:23.205]  Maybe 15-20% in support of them.
[01:17:23.225 --> 01:17:23.205]  5%.
[01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:25.627]  It started really with 3%.
[01:17:27.413 --> 01:17:29.594]  And we don't need the majority.
[01:17:29.614 --> 01:17:33.115]  We do have the majority now on those 9-11s and inside jobs and major polls.
[01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:39.237]  The average person knows something's wrong, but do not expect these jellyfish to help themselves and their families.
[01:17:40.098 --> 01:17:49.101]  They've been trained from cradle to where they are today to just watch television, suck their thumbs, eat cheeseburgers, and giggle and snicker and play video games.
[01:17:50.282 --> 01:17:57.728]  I'm talking about the few good men, the few good women that are willing to stand up, to fight, to get involved at every level to fight the New World Order and expose them.
[01:17:57.768 --> 01:18:01.772]  We can, we must, and we shall prevail against this wickedness.
[01:18:04.214 --> 01:18:06.556]  I have stacks of unbelievable tyranny in front of me.
[01:18:06.596 --> 01:18:07.777]  Just open admissions.
[01:18:09.638 --> 01:18:11.620]  Our government has gone completely bad.
[01:18:12.432 --> 01:18:20.794]  And is simply trying to organize and manage and convince the general public to accept living in a literal, hellish, police state system.
[01:18:23.835 --> 01:18:31.317]  And that's why I work so hard, that's why there's so much anger and so much focus in my voice, because I see it clearly for what it is.
[01:18:31.377 --> 01:18:34.538]  And let me tell you, the people we're fighting are the scum of the earth.
[01:18:34.598 --> 01:18:37.379]  I mean, these are hard-core killers.
[01:18:38.759 --> 01:18:39.620]  They kill the innocent.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.480]  They are greedy.
[01:18:41.773 --> 01:18:42.814]  They are thugs.
[01:18:42.834 --> 01:18:43.635]  They are predatory.
[01:18:43.675 --> 01:18:49.239]  They think that you and I are here for just to be fed on.
[01:18:49.479 --> 01:18:52.622]  And they got another thing coming.
[01:18:53.723 --> 01:18:55.904]  By now it is no surprise that the U.S.
[01:18:55.964 --> 01:19:01.549]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:19:01.769 --> 01:19:06.233]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become
[01:19:11.545 --> 01:19:11.965]  Thank you.
[01:19:41.425 --> 01:19:44.067]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[01:19:44.207 --> 01:19:47.190]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:48.571]  It includes the history of U.S.
[01:19:48.631 --> 01:19:50.613]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards,
[01:20:11.058 --> 01:20:12.718]  Learn the stability of real money.
[01:20:13.138 --> 01:20:15.199]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[01:20:15.599 --> 01:20:17.139]  They are instruments of debt.
[01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.440]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.

[01:20:53.331 --> 01:20:58.615]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:20:58.815 --> 01:21:00.896]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:21:01.136 --> 01:21:08.261]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:21:08.381 --> 01:21:19.929]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:21.470]  It's multi-voltage
[01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:22.390]  We're good to go!
[01:21:55.105 --> 01:21:57.427]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:58.447 --> 01:22:01.289]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:12.456]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:13.397 --> 01:22:18.540]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.
[01:22:19.344 --> 01:22:30.169]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:22:30.789 --> 01:22:33.290]  Star War technology at its best.
[01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:38.432]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit www.laysmedinc.com or call 702-953-0267.
[01:22:56.272 --> 01:23:02.293]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:02.913 --> 01:23:05.874]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.835 --> 01:23:08.975]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:23:08.995 --> 01:23:10.015]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:23:10.035 --> 01:23:17.777]  I'm going to play an audio piece of them bulldozing and killing an American citizen over in Israel and then how they treated people in the days after.
[01:23:17.817 --> 01:23:19.417]  That really proves it's all premeditated.
[01:23:20.717 --> 01:23:23.958]  Firing over their heads with a machine gun from about ten feet away just for enjoyment.
[01:23:24.726 --> 01:23:26.227]  Right now, let's go ahead.
[01:23:26.347 --> 01:23:27.989]  That's American Citizens, by the way, being fired at.
[01:23:28.389 --> 01:23:33.673]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Wisconsin, and Andrew, Andy, and others.
[01:23:33.713 --> 01:23:34.373]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:23:34.914 --> 01:23:36.655]  Hey Alex, I've got three things for you.
[01:23:37.496 --> 01:23:44.961]  We've been told that the war on terrorism is supposed to rout out all terrorist threats, not necessarily against us.
[01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.482]  And it will last a hundred years!
[01:23:46.903 --> 01:23:49.925]  Yes, but I want to focus on Hezbollah, because
[01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:58.933]  While they haven't attacked us, they are a terrorist organization, and under what Bush said, I think he could be going against them next, under some guise.
[01:23:59.293 --> 01:24:04.515]  But I think the UN is quietly keeping track of all these atrocities, and if you don't think so...
[01:24:05.197 --> 01:24:12.360]  Well, just look what happened to... Well, no, they've said they have, and then they get to pose as the good savior later, when they're controlled by the same globalist.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:12.880]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:21.743]  And the second thing is, are these the same air marshals that were cannibalized from the Border Patrol, which was supposed to get more funding, and then they got diverted?
[01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:35.393]  Yeah, what they did is Texas alone lost over 20% of its border patrol in the year after 9-11 because they offered them an increase in pay of $24,000 on top of the $35,000 that a starting border patrol agent got.
[01:24:35.794 --> 01:24:41.618]  So most of them tried to then go become air marshals to defend against, I guess, the government carrying out another attack.
[01:24:41.638 --> 01:24:42.779]  It was all totally staged.
[01:24:43.139 --> 01:24:46.362]  And then now they're ordered to create little secret police files on everybody who's innocent.
[01:24:47.954 --> 01:24:52.598]  If you want to be a good little brown shirt and get paid and get incentives and raises, then I guess you should.
[01:24:52.638 --> 01:24:55.100]  Okay, and last but not least, I'd like to repeal the SPP for our area.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.462]  I found out that our Common Council passed a resolution
[01:25:12.631 --> 01:25:14.834]  Removing authority from the Patriot Act.
[01:25:15.394 --> 01:25:16.816]  They made a couple of start lines.
[01:25:16.876 --> 01:25:21.261]  Yes, you can get the Security and Prosperity Partnership, block it at the local level.
[01:25:21.301 --> 01:25:24.004]  Again, for those who don't know, that's the American Union now in force.
[01:25:24.564 --> 01:25:33.014]  Yes, and I was wondering if for executive orders it works any different than just a regular petition to get something else thrown out or banned.
[01:25:34.983 --> 01:25:42.366]  Well, I mean, certainly, it's just the sense of your town council or your city council that they're not going to go along with that.
[01:25:42.927 --> 01:25:57.233]  And then here in Texas, we've got the documents over the weekend, it's now official, I'm trying to get Watson to write an article about it, because I'm too busy to, where they're now saying they'll have biometrics in an American Union ID card, we have the PDF file off the SPP website, SPP.gov,
[01:25:58.406 --> 01:26:08.652]  And so we have the cities and counties here in Texas already this month telling everybody we're now under the American Union and using American Union codes.
[01:26:10.793 --> 01:26:14.215]  Also, Skinner Darkly is a really creepy movie.
[01:26:14.475 --> 01:26:20.579]  I appreciated your character turning on that light switch saying, oh by the way, did you notice?
[01:26:20.919 --> 01:26:21.780]  It was all just creepy.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.762]  It was like a caged set of rats that the cage was shaken up
[01:26:26.212 --> 01:26:28.393]  And they just went nuts and didn't know what to do.
[01:26:28.693 --> 01:26:30.294]  Didn't know they were even in a cage.
[01:26:31.054 --> 01:26:33.235]  Well, that's exactly... I mean, that's a good description of the film.
[01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:35.076]  Yeah, okay.
[01:26:35.296 --> 01:26:36.537]  Well, have a good one.
[01:26:36.577 --> 01:26:39.158]  That's all I can say, and I'm sorry for all the atrocities.
[01:26:39.819 --> 01:26:42.580]  God forgive our government, because we know not what they do.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:44.421]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[01:26:44.461 --> 01:26:47.562]  Talking about A Scanner Darkly, it's Warner Independent.
[01:26:47.662 --> 01:26:49.663]  People go, Warner Brothers, they're evil, they're New World Order.
[01:26:50.424 --> 01:26:54.826]  What happens is they go up and buy up all the, you know, a bunch of movies that get made.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:05.569]  Richard Linklater, Tommy Pallotta, and others, George Clooney, funded and financed making A Scanner Darkly for $9 million.
[01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:14.799]  Keanu Reeves has gotten over $100 million for a movie before, on average $25 million per movie, took $64,000 to make the movie.
[01:27:16.461 --> 01:27:17.842]  So did Winona Ryder, all of them.
[01:27:20.552 --> 01:27:22.253]  Everybody, you know, basically did it for nothing.
[01:27:22.273 --> 01:27:24.015]  I think I got paid like $2,000 or something.
[01:27:24.095 --> 01:27:25.756]  I wasn't even asking for it.
[01:27:25.796 --> 01:27:27.057]  You know, you gotta get paid something.
[01:27:28.798 --> 01:27:32.201]  Now understand that then you have to get it distributed.
[01:27:32.261 --> 01:27:36.344]  And only the movie theaters are told what they can carry and told what they'll be given.
[01:27:36.364 --> 01:27:39.706]  You understand a movie theater, unless it's a small independent, cannot say what it wants.
[01:27:40.127 --> 01:27:41.388]  It is told what it gets.
[01:27:43.889 --> 01:27:47.292]  Scanner Darkly opened three weeks ago in 17 theaters.
[01:27:48.093 --> 01:27:48.773]  And I looked it up.
[01:27:48.813 --> 01:27:49.754]  It's never happened before.
[01:27:50.527 --> 01:27:53.188]  It was in the top 10 releases.
[01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:56.650]  Top 10 at the box office that weekend in 17 theaters.
[01:27:57.350 --> 01:28:03.073]  Every other movie it was up against was in 3,000, 2,000, 1,000, 500 theaters.
[01:28:03.093 --> 01:28:04.333]  17 theaters and it was in the top 10.
[01:28:04.453 --> 01:28:05.534]  It was number 10.
[01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:10.536]  Then they only released it in 200 and something and that's, by belief, still how many theaters it's in.
[01:28:11.877 --> 01:28:14.058]  And I'm not going to get into the whole back side of this but
[01:28:15.385 --> 01:28:17.986]  Warner Brothers, uh... I don't want to get into it.
[01:28:18.046 --> 01:28:19.106]  Just believe me folks.
[01:28:19.486 --> 01:28:23.407]  It was hard to make this movie and Warner Brothers is basically sitting on it.
[01:28:24.348 --> 01:28:27.269]  And, uh... I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:28:27.309 --> 01:28:28.849]  Top 10 in 17 theaters.
[01:28:29.829 --> 01:28:35.031]  The critics were saying, my gosh, with that type of showing, it should be put in thousands of theaters.
[01:28:35.071 --> 01:28:35.871]  Probably not going to happen.
[01:28:36.151 --> 01:28:38.592]  So... We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.612 --> 01:28:38.952]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.962 --> 01:28:46.983]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.003 --> 01:28:50.704]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.805 --> 01:28:57.866]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:01.467]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:29:01.647 --> 01:29:05.108]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:08.624]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:08.644 --> 01:29:14.127]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:29:14.167 --> 01:29:21.251]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job.
[01:29:21.271 --> 01:29:23.792]  A few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:29:23.912 --> 01:29:25.253]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:29:25.293 --> 01:29:30.696]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:29:31.096 --> 01:29:37.079]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems, it'll work on other problems as well.
[01:29:37.239 --> 01:29:41.122]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:42.002]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:29:54.016 --> 01:29:57.580]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:58.141]  are located?
[01:29:58.341 --> 01:30:01.725]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:30:01.965 --> 01:30:06.670]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:11.956]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:30:12.236 --> 01:30:12.556]  I think so.
[01:30:31.681 --> 01:30:31.901]  I think so.
[01:30:53.428 --> 01:31:00.271]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[01:31:00.551 --> 01:31:06.114]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[01:31:06.414 --> 01:31:12.997]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[01:31:13.217 --> 01:31:20.000]  This patented steel reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:29.306]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[01:31:29.546 --> 01:31:33.028]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[01:31:33.329 --> 01:31:36.811]  Its many self-sufficient and high security features will amaze you.
[01:31:37.111 --> 01:31:44.416]  With Nuclear World War 3 looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey ready for a new owner.
[01:31:44.716 --> 01:31:48.859]  For more information visit www.ultimatesecurehome.com.
[01:31:49.079 --> 01:31:52.761]  That's www.ultimatesecurehome.com.
[01:31:54.643 --> 01:31:57.384]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.404 --> 01:32:01.327]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:07.371]  It's not hype when I say that
[01:32:09.602 --> 01:32:14.544]  My new film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, is my most powerful film.
[01:32:14.624 --> 01:32:22.547]  It is heads and shoulders above martial law, above road to tyranny, above police state three-total enslavement, above the order of death.
[01:32:22.567 --> 01:32:23.867]  And those are all excellent films.
[01:32:24.587 --> 01:32:26.028]  If you don't have them, you should get them.
[01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:31.170]  I got a deal where you get my new film, The Order of Death, with the new footage shot inside Bohemian Grove last year.
[01:32:31.866 --> 01:32:44.250]  With information tying it into the Skull and Bones, the High Level Masons, and then on that same DVD you get my original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, now shot six years ago, on the same DVD.
[01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:45.451]  Two films for the price of one.
[01:32:45.471 --> 01:32:51.553]  I've got a bunch of other specials where you can get my films as low as $5.95 a piece when you get multiple DVDs or VHS films.
[01:32:52.753 --> 01:33:01.156]  But my new film Terror Storm covers, like no other film, the history of government-sponsored terror, the USS Liberty, Gulf of Tonkin, Gleiwitz with Hitler,
[01:33:01.829 --> 01:33:27.658]  And then we go right into 9-11, we go right into 7-7, we've got CIA Analyst Ray McGovern, MI5 agents David Shaler and Andy Michon, Member of Parliament, former Blair Cabinet Member, Michael Meacher, we've got Professor Stephen Jones who joins us in the next hour, Morgan Reynolds, I mean it really goes on and on, the whole Charlie Sheen thing is in there,
[01:33:29.955 --> 01:33:46.202]  And what he went through when he went public, it is, it's got a professional music score that, well, Graham Reynolds did the music for Scanner Darkly and other big films and he's just such a great composer and I think he had like 15 different musicians on it.
[01:33:46.902 --> 01:33:50.904]  This was actually done in a sound studio to the film we completed.
[01:33:52.399 --> 01:33:59.165]  This is my best film and they just get better and better.
[01:33:59.525 --> 01:34:04.690]  Please get your copy of Terror Storm right now available at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:04.710 --> 01:34:13.178]  You can order via the Safe, Secure Online Video and Bookstore or you can simply call toll free to ask questions about the different specials or what the films cover and then order via the telephone at 1-888-253-3139
[01:34:18.206 --> 01:34:19.787]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:19.807 --> 01:34:27.812]  Or you can just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:34:29.613 --> 01:34:34.596]  And as soon as you get Terror Storm, slap it in the DVD burner, start making copies.
[01:34:34.717 --> 01:34:35.557]  Don't stop!
[01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.899]  This film is really waking people up.
[01:34:38.599 --> 01:34:40.520]  And it's our job to expose the criminals.
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:43.862]  I mean, it feels so good to know the murderers that carried out 9-11 and 7-7.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.721]  And Oklahoma City would get into that, are all going to be exposed.
[01:34:49.022 --> 01:34:58.386]  And you hurt them badly when you get the films and you just aggressively, viciously, militarily, just start burning copies.
[01:34:58.966 --> 01:35:02.988]  Knowing each time you do it, you punch the New World Order right in their big fat nose.

[01:35:12.679 --> 01:35:16.261]  Whatever your dial-up or T1 or cable modem speed is.
[01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:22.744]  All 15 of my films, my special reports, most of the 9-11 Neocon Symposium is now posted.
[01:35:22.804 --> 01:35:25.806]  By the time we're done with it, the questions, the answers, everything is going to be there.
[01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:30.248]  I don't know, it's like 14 hours of it's now been uploaded in two days.
[01:35:30.288 --> 01:35:30.648]  I think there's
[01:35:31.571 --> 01:35:32.371]  Six hours left.
[01:35:32.391 --> 01:35:35.152]  We're going to be putting up the PrisonPlanet.tv members in the next few weeks.
[01:35:35.572 --> 01:35:39.613]  My weekly TV reports everything at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:39.933 --> 01:35:48.656]  And you can go there and just burn discs, burn copies of my TV shows, my special reports, Steven Jones presentation, Dr. Bob Bowman's presentation, Webster Tarpley's presentation.
[01:35:49.637 --> 01:35:54.260]  Just Jim Fetzer's presentation, my presentation, all of it.
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.742]  It's such an activist tool.
[01:35:56.142 --> 01:35:58.404]  PrisonPlanet.tv, it's a weapon!
[01:35:58.904 --> 01:35:59.324]  Use it!
[01:35:59.765 --> 01:36:01.566]  I know a lot of you are, so let's continue!
[01:36:01.606 --> 01:36:02.447]  Let's intensify!
[01:36:04.889 --> 01:36:11.134]  Now, I got an audio clip I want to play of them killing Rachel Corey, and then what they did in the days after it, which proves it was all premeditated.
[01:36:11.935 --> 01:36:12.975]  And I want to take your calls.
[01:36:13.516 --> 01:36:16.038]  Andrew in Japan is up next, and then Andy, Jim, Robert.
[01:36:16.698 --> 01:36:17.479]  And Luke and others.
[01:36:17.499 --> 01:36:21.542]  We'll get to all your calls before the show ends, but just for the next minute or two, I'm always honored to have her on.
[01:36:21.562 --> 01:36:22.803]  I like to have her up a few times a week.
[01:36:23.203 --> 01:36:32.351]  Debbie Morrow is the lady who answers the phone just for the radio orders for New Millennium Concepts, the national manufacturer and distributor of the Big Berkey black element systems.
[01:36:32.691 --> 01:36:36.154]  They also have British made if you wish those, but I buy American now that they're available.
[01:36:36.354 --> 01:36:37.235]  The best was the British.
[01:36:37.295 --> 01:36:38.216]  Now the American is better.
[01:36:38.456 --> 01:36:39.537]  I've seen the University Studies.
[01:36:39.577 --> 01:36:44.661]  We use the Black Berkey in our office, and I've bought seven or eight of these last year to give as gifts.
[01:36:45.704 --> 01:36:47.086]  So that's how much I believe in these.
[01:36:47.126 --> 01:36:48.587]  It makes your water pure and delicious.
[01:36:49.207 --> 01:36:51.049]  And they've got a bunch of big specials for you.
[01:36:51.369 --> 01:36:52.631]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:36:52.851 --> 01:36:53.371]  Hi, Alex.
[01:36:53.431 --> 01:36:55.073]  Thank you very much for having me.
[01:36:55.613 --> 01:36:56.394]  I'll be brief.
[01:36:56.954 --> 01:37:08.064]  I just wanted to call in and invite people to place their orders to help support your short wave time, as well as to get their Berkey water filters as soon as possible.
[01:37:08.545 --> 01:37:10.807]  We're getting busier as the days go by.
[01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:20.107]  We just want to make sure everybody out there has good drinking water, especially with all these brownouts and, you know, the power outages everywhere.
[01:37:20.567 --> 01:37:27.451]  You know, the water companies all depend on electricity to get their water clean and to get the water out to the public.
[01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:31.153]  And if you've got grids going out all over the country,
[01:37:31.877 --> 01:37:34.518]  Well then that just goes to, you know, reason.
[01:37:34.578 --> 01:37:37.900]  You can take water right out of the swamp and put it in the big Berkey.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.703]  You can, but the main thing is the ongoing crisis of the poisons in the water right now.
[01:37:42.783 --> 01:37:44.123]  Stop drinking the tap water.
[01:37:44.143 --> 01:37:45.784]  Stop giving it to your children.
[01:37:45.804 --> 01:37:52.107]  But yes, every hurricane season, you guys last year sold out for a few weeks and had to make more at the factory.
[01:37:52.988 --> 01:37:54.829]  People, they ship it to you UPS ground.
[01:37:54.889 --> 01:37:55.329]  Don't wait.
[01:37:55.349 --> 01:38:00.011]  You can order via Infowars.com or Berkeywater.com or by calling toll free 1-888-
[01:38:01.459 --> 01:38:02.280]  803-4438.
[01:38:03.942 --> 01:38:12.410]  And understand, folks, when you tell them it's an Alex Jones Special, you get a massive discount on, let's say, a 259 filter for $199, when you get a 259 filter that's normally over $300.
[01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:15.974]  These very same units, made by them, are over $300 in camping supply stores.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:29.825]  This is such a great deal, and yes, they fund our international global shortwave outreach that doesn't really fund us.
[01:38:30.225 --> 01:38:34.768]  It's just an outreach we do that we know is very effective globally, and they are our sponsor for that.
[01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:35.789]  So it's made in America.
[01:38:36.049 --> 01:38:37.169]  It supports the broadcast.
[01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:38.910]  It's the top of the line filtration system.
[01:38:39.371 --> 01:38:42.273]  They've got a bunch of great free gifts for survival and preparedness.
[01:38:42.613 --> 01:38:47.296]  When you get the $1.99 special, you get one free gift.
[01:38:47.336 --> 01:38:49.217]  The $2.59 special, you get two free gifts.
[01:38:49.717 --> 01:38:55.258]  Debbie, that number is 888-803-4438 and it's getting real busy right now, isn't it?
[01:38:55.498 --> 01:38:56.418]  Yes, it really is.
[01:38:56.438 --> 01:38:58.539]  The last few days especially.
[01:38:58.659 --> 01:39:02.260]  So, please be patient when I call you back.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.980]  Leave me good numbers to call you back.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:06.101]  I will call you back.
[01:39:06.901 --> 01:39:10.582]  And just get your orders in before we have to be delayed.
[01:39:11.542 --> 01:39:16.883]  Well, Debbie, to explain how this happened, Jim Shepard was the national distributor of the British Berkies going back over a decade.
[01:39:18.024 --> 01:39:20.227]  I mean, if you got him in the U.S., you got him through a jam.
[01:39:20.828 --> 01:39:24.733]  And then he, for years, studied and designed the black American Berkey.
[01:39:24.893 --> 01:39:25.835]  Still sells the British.
[01:39:26.650 --> 01:39:47.904]  And so people kept saying, we want a British, we want an American, we want to be able to buy this from you wholesale, but you guys only supply wholesalers, you didn't have retail, so Jim just has Debbie and her assistant to just handle this radio show and a few others, and this is the only place they direct sale, and you're getting the cost that distributors are paying when they buy 10, 15, 20 of these.
[01:39:47.944 --> 01:39:50.966]  So that's how you're getting this, and Jim is a patriot,
[01:39:52.227 --> 01:39:53.127]  Debbie's a patriot.
[01:39:53.147 --> 01:39:55.188]  They're good Christian anti-New World Order people.
[01:39:55.449 --> 01:39:56.949]  They're giving you this great deal.
[01:39:57.430 --> 01:40:00.392]  So you cannot beat it.
[01:40:00.412 --> 01:40:01.252]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:40:01.272 --> 01:40:03.914]  And if the phone's busy, leave your name and number.
[01:40:03.954 --> 01:40:04.974]  Debbie will call you back.
[01:40:05.315 --> 01:40:06.455]  Debbie, thank you for coming on.
[01:40:06.475 --> 01:40:07.296]  You do a great job.
[01:40:07.416 --> 01:40:08.156]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:40:08.336 --> 01:40:09.317]  Take care and God bless.
[01:40:09.477 --> 01:40:09.898]  You bet!
[01:40:09.938 --> 01:40:11.139]  She is a great lady, folks.
[01:40:11.179 --> 01:40:17.326]  Give her a call at 888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com or link through at InfoWars.com.
[01:40:17.346 --> 01:40:19.168]  It's on our shopping cart, the exact same stuff.
[01:40:19.428 --> 01:40:21.931]  We fax the orders over daily or go to Berkeywater.com.
[01:40:22.331 --> 01:40:26.055]  Just tell them in the comment section that it's an Alex Jones special and what free gift you want.
[01:40:26.496 --> 01:40:30.300]  Alright, without further ado, let's play this clip of Rachel Corey.
[01:40:31.118 --> 01:40:34.481]  being killed and then there's a house right there on the property.
[01:40:34.501 --> 01:40:52.276]  This is happening back in 2004 and this is the armored bulldozer coming up with the armored vehicle firing M60 machine guns at about 10 feet away right over their heads and then spraying the CS tear gas, military grade tear gas, on them.
[01:40:53.457 --> 01:40:55.479]  This is important because it shows
[01:40:56.388 --> 01:41:10.279]  that this is peaceful American citizens out there putting a wreath up about 10 feet outside this house on what's been Palestinian land for thousands of years living in peace together and this is what the bullet holes in the house the rest of it so here it is.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:16.604]  Almost every day Israeli troops leave their base to bulldoze Palestinian houses.
[01:41:17.544 --> 01:41:23.349]  They say it's to deny terrorists cover but most of the houses belong to ordinary Palestinians.
[01:41:25.586 --> 01:41:29.328]  Thousands have lost their homes, some with only moments notice.
[01:41:30.829 --> 01:41:32.150]  And there's no compensation.
[01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:43.477]  For two years, despite tear gas and bullets, a small group of British and American protesters from the International Solidarity Movement has tried to stop the bulldozers.
[01:41:49.061 --> 01:41:51.302]  One of the protesters filmed these pictures.
[01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:14.848]  Stop it right there.
[01:42:15.788 --> 01:42:16.228]  Pause it.
[01:42:16.488 --> 01:42:28.375]  Now understand, the armored vehicle, the armored bulldozer pulls up and is literally 10 feet away from the peaceful hippies and he's firing the M60 literally inches above their heads.
[01:42:29.111 --> 01:42:38.754]  Okay, picture, an armored tank bulldozer and they're sitting there right by a little house and it's firing a heavy machine gun right over their heads.
[01:42:38.814 --> 01:42:50.917]  Please continue.
[01:42:50.957 --> 01:42:53.938]  Two days before our visit, a protester had been killed.
[01:42:55.948 --> 01:42:59.169]  Rachel Corey was the first American to be killed in Gaza.
[01:42:59.869 --> 01:43:02.990]  She was at eye level with the driver of the bulldozer.
[01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:12.772]  Her head and upper torso were actually above the blade of the bulldozer, so he could very clearly see that she was there, her in her orange fluorescent jacket that she was wearing.
[01:43:13.352 --> 01:43:18.233]  But instead of stopping at this point, he continued forward, which buried her, lulled her legs down.
[01:43:18.253 --> 01:43:21.914]  And as she got pulled down, she was pulled out of view of the bulldozer driver.
[01:43:22.354 --> 01:43:25.155]  And if he had stopped at this point, he may have only just broken her legs.
[01:43:25.615 --> 01:43:30.477]  But he continued forward anyway until she was sucked all the way underneath the bulldozer.
[01:43:34.558 --> 01:43:37.299]  The Israeli Defense Force says the driver did not see her.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:43.221]  That Rachel Corey died because of her own irresponsible and illegal behavior.
[01:43:43.861 --> 01:43:46.042]  You can see the space underneath the bulldozer.
[01:43:46.462 --> 01:43:47.863]  It wasn't the treads that killed her.
[01:43:48.203 --> 01:43:49.684]  She didn't get run over by the treads.
[01:43:49.704 --> 01:43:51.084]  It was only the blade.
[01:43:51.104 --> 01:43:53.645]  Either a really gross
[01:43:54.127 --> 01:43:57.568]  A mistake or a really brutal murder?
[01:43:59.248 --> 01:44:01.068]  She was talking and her lip was torn.
[01:44:01.088 --> 01:44:03.169]  It was just like, oh my God, she survived.
[01:44:03.309 --> 01:44:04.689]  And then she said, my back is broken.
[01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:06.109]  And I held her head.
[01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:14.211]  I'd taken my phone out to call an ambulance, but as soon as she said, my back is broken, I dropped the phone and just held onto her head to try and stabilize her spine.
[01:44:15.191 --> 01:44:16.271]  And it was just such a miracle.
[01:44:16.311 --> 01:44:17.971]  It was like, how did she survive?
[01:44:19.131 --> 01:44:20.612]  She looks a mess, but it doesn't matter.
[01:44:21.132 --> 01:44:21.692]  She's alive.
[01:44:21.712 --> 01:44:22.272]  She's talking.
[01:44:23.168 --> 01:44:24.129]  But not for long.
[01:44:25.170 --> 01:44:26.912]  Rachel died soon afterwards.
[01:44:26.932 --> 01:44:34.439]  I just have an image of her as I last saw her before she was engulfed.
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:46.470]  Just scrabbling, desperately trying to free herself and trying to get out of the way the world has her.
[01:44:48.863 --> 01:44:53.645]  That afternoon, Rachel Coley's friends planned to hold a memorial service on the front line.
[01:44:57.706 --> 01:45:02.508]  If Rachel made a mistake, it was to believe she could protest in the same way she would have in America.
[01:45:03.148 --> 01:45:04.769]  But here, there are different rules.
[01:45:06.753 --> 01:45:12.535]  The peace activists are going to lay flowers on the spot where Rachel was killed by the bulldozer a couple of days ago.
[01:45:12.555 --> 01:45:22.119]  This area is surrounded by Israeli checkpoints, so we're being watched by Israelis right now.
[01:45:22.179 --> 01:45:25.040]  I was about to learn my own lesson about the rules of life here.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.941]  How do you feel about what Rachel did?
[01:45:32.834 --> 01:45:39.478]  The shots came from an armoured personnel carrier speeding towards the memorial service.
[01:46:15.022 --> 01:46:21.447]  When some of the protesters stood their ground, the armoured personnel carrier tear gassed them and then fired over their heads.
[01:46:28.272 --> 01:46:31.073]  Rachel Corey's memorial service came to an abrupt end.
[01:46:47.861 --> 01:46:51.584]  Later I return to the house that overlooks the place where Rachel Corey died.
[01:46:51.604 --> 01:46:53.986]  She used to sleep here to help protect it.
[01:46:54.667 --> 01:46:57.449]  It's owned by a pharmacist, Dr. Samir Nasrallah.
[01:46:57.469 --> 01:46:59.951]  Rachel!
[01:47:02.509 --> 01:47:04.609]  This house is really the front line.
[01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:07.570]  This is the last house left standing in what was a neighborhood.
[01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:11.511]  And now this is just one lonely house on the frontier, on its own.
[01:47:13.511 --> 01:47:14.891]  Walk with me, okay?
[01:47:15.091 --> 01:47:18.552]  His front door opens onto what the Israelis call the combat zone.
[01:47:19.192 --> 01:47:21.672]  They shoot first, then ask questions.
[01:47:21.692 --> 01:47:27.573]  So that's where Rachel was when she died.
[01:47:27.593 --> 01:47:27.873]  Yeah.
[01:47:28.754 --> 01:47:30.774]  And the bulldozers start to come in.
[01:47:32.637 --> 01:47:35.999]  What do we say?
[01:47:36.139 --> 01:47:37.979]  We heard the sound of something approaching.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:40.160]  Dr. Samir sprinted for the house.
[01:47:44.422 --> 01:47:46.023]  We've had to cut that in.
[01:47:46.323 --> 01:47:47.444]  A tank is now coming.
[01:47:47.464 --> 01:47:48.424]  We have to get inside.
[01:47:50.685 --> 01:47:52.246]  Which may not be much safer.
[01:47:55.387 --> 01:48:00.749]  It's huge.
[01:48:04.175 --> 01:48:05.616]  Now you won't ever see them all again.
[01:48:07.196 --> 01:48:14.020]  Wow.
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:15.140]  Is that noise?
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:16.021]  Is that a tank?
[01:48:16.221 --> 01:48:16.521]  Yeah.
[01:48:17.762 --> 01:48:19.923]  And aren't your children scared?
[01:48:19.943 --> 01:48:20.023]  Yeah.
[01:48:20.303 --> 01:48:24.225]  Every day hearing the gunshots.
[01:48:24.845 --> 01:48:25.486]  Every day.
[01:48:26.346 --> 01:48:28.367]  What's that signing?
[01:48:32.081 --> 01:48:36.204]  Azmi Keshawy, our local producer, is worried.
[01:48:39.125 --> 01:48:41.847]  They stay because they've put their life savings in this house.
[01:48:42.367 --> 01:48:43.788]  They're still paying off the mortgage.
[01:48:44.749 --> 01:48:45.869]  I can't sleep, you know.
[01:48:46.410 --> 01:48:50.032]  I smoke about 40 to 50 cigarettes.
[01:48:51.373 --> 01:48:56.516]  Because during the night, I'm thinking, wait, sound.
[01:48:57.236 --> 01:48:58.677]  I'm open, see, near.
[01:49:00.898 --> 01:49:04.580]  Alright, there's a little bit more you can watch at InfoWars.com
[01:49:31.289 --> 01:49:39.876]  Understand, they don't give them any money when they bulldoze, in some cases, family homes that have been owned for over half a millennium, 500 years.
[01:49:40.756 --> 01:49:43.298]  Just like in the U.S., you're not going to be paid for your houses either.
[01:49:43.318 --> 01:49:45.100]  It's already happening.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.362]  We're all going to be living like this soon.
[01:49:47.942 --> 01:49:48.803]  Hope you enjoy it.
[01:49:56.943 --> 01:49:57.463]  It's here!
[01:49:57.643 --> 01:50:02.424]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.784 --> 01:50:10.446]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.126 --> 01:50:18.187]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.568 --> 01:50:25.469]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:50:25.959 --> 01:50:30.002]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.303 --> 01:50:33.805]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.286 --> 01:50:36.187]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.528 --> 01:50:40.451]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:59.203 --> 01:53:01.043]  Professor Steven Jones coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:01.824 --> 01:53:05.065]  Andrew, holding patiently from Japan, calling us on an IT phone.
[01:53:05.425 --> 01:53:06.805]  Welcome, Andrew, in Japan.
[01:53:08.024 --> 01:53:10.066]  Hi Alex, I hope you can hear me this time.
[01:53:10.346 --> 01:53:10.586]  Sure.
[01:53:12.908 --> 01:53:15.450]  I just want to say you did a great job on Terror Storm.
[01:53:17.172 --> 01:53:20.655]  It's a great chronicle of government-sponsored terror.
[01:53:23.077 --> 01:53:30.163]  I especially found the USS Liberty piece very, very interesting and sad at the same time.
[01:53:30.323 --> 01:53:33.986]  But anyways, I just wanted to say you did a good job on that.
[01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:41.372]  What I really wanted to ask you about was two things, actually.
[01:53:41.392 --> 01:53:47.694]  I'm sure you've heard of the new World Trade Center movie coming out by Oliver Stone.
[01:53:48.234 --> 01:53:49.115]  What's your take on that?
[01:53:49.175 --> 01:53:53.536]  Is it going to be a big piece of propaganda, or is there going to be some truth to it, or what?
[01:53:53.556 --> 01:53:55.457]  Because I cringed when I saw the trailer.
[01:53:56.818 --> 01:54:02.060]  I really respect Oliver Stone, and I've now seen his director's cut of JFK.
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.780]  It is now my favorite film.
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:05.261]  I could never say which film was my favorite.
[01:54:06.412 --> 01:54:10.496]  Uh, you know, seeing it with Jim Garrison goes throughout to say it's very similar to my own life.
[01:54:10.576 --> 01:54:17.001]  A lot of things you see in the movie, I mean, so many of them, uh, you know, experiences I've had, it's so accurate.
[01:54:17.041 --> 01:54:19.203]  You know, Jim Mars really was the main writer of that.
[01:54:19.323 --> 01:54:20.384]  By the way, it's funny you mention that.
[01:54:20.444 --> 01:54:22.906]  Jim is coming on Thursday for two hours.
[01:54:22.926 --> 01:54:29.732]  We're going to play clips of the director's cut and get his comments on the JFK assassination from the view of the movie, which is extremely accurate.
[01:54:30.985 --> 01:54:39.470]  Oliver Stone has tried his best with Scarface, with Platoon, and with JFK as Crowning Achievement.
[01:54:40.650 --> 01:54:43.452]  He says, look, I just want to make a movie about heroes.
[01:54:44.246 --> 01:55:06.594]  You know, he said, I've seen his quotes, regardless of what really happened, he even said that a few weeks ago, I had it in a stacked cover and didn't, he said regardless of what really went on and the questions of 9-11, he said, I'm making one about the heroes, we know those firefighters were heroes, and it doesn't have hijackers, it doesn't have Arabs from what I've heard, and it doesn't get into all that fake stuff, and I think he's allowed to make a movie about the firefighters
[01:55:07.114 --> 01:55:08.595]  Yeah, I definitely respect him too.
[01:55:08.615 --> 01:55:09.175]  I thought JFK was great.
[01:55:09.195 --> 01:55:11.696]  When I saw the trailer, at first, I was really... I gritted my teeth.
[01:55:32.037 --> 01:55:48.728]  And then I checked it out, and I heard that Oliver Stone was doing it, and I do have respect for him, but then again, it's a big, big Hollywood production, and I'm in Japan, and I saw a trailer for it, so I'm thinking anything that gets this kind of exposure has got to be a propaganda tool.
[01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:56.890]  Well, I mean, I think in the end it is going to be used for propaganda, but I think, you know, the guy every once in a while is allowed to make a non-political film, and that's what he said.
[01:55:56.910 --> 01:56:01.531]  He said, look, I'm not being political in this, I'm not, you know, getting into debates about what really happened.
[01:56:01.551 --> 01:56:02.271]  I know there are questions.
[01:56:02.331 --> 01:56:03.491]  I've got his quote somewhere.
[01:56:03.511 --> 01:56:04.531]  It's similar to what I just said.
[01:56:04.551 --> 01:56:09.812]  He just said, I'm trying to just, you know, make a hit movie about heroes in honor of the firefighters.
[01:56:09.832 --> 01:56:13.113]  And I don't think you can, you know, none of us are taking away from the firefighters.
[01:56:13.644 --> 01:56:14.725]  I mean, they're heroes.
[01:56:15.125 --> 01:56:18.206]  And I know you're not doing that either, but certainly we're all irritated by it.
[01:56:18.726 --> 01:56:20.147]  But I have to wait until I see the film.
[01:56:20.427 --> 01:56:24.929]  Now, if I see a bunch of New World Order propaganda, it means they got to him or something.
[01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:26.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:27.931 --> 01:56:30.292]  I have another question, but it's more for Stephen Jones.
[01:56:30.692 --> 01:56:32.493]  I was hoping maybe you could relay it to him.
[01:56:32.533 --> 01:56:33.333]  Sure, what is it?
[01:56:35.314 --> 01:56:39.156]  I just noticed when I'm looking at the tapes over and over again of the
[01:56:40.202 --> 01:56:44.164]  I mean, it's only been a few months since I've woken up and... Sure, quickly, your phone's real bad.
[01:56:44.885 --> 01:56:45.925]  Oh, sorry about that.
[01:56:46.626 --> 01:56:51.648]  Just, the way that the towers fell was more sequential, top to bottom.
[01:56:52.029 --> 01:56:53.930]  The way that World Trade Center 7 fell...
[01:56:55.034 --> 01:56:57.335]  Seemed more like the bottom was taken out.
[01:56:57.375 --> 01:57:01.536]  Yeah, no, it was the classic control demolition and they blew tower one and two top down.
[01:57:01.856 --> 01:57:06.818]  You can see the blast squib shooting out from top down three or four floors below as it explodes.
[01:57:07.518 --> 01:57:15.201]  The blast going up before it collapses and pulverizes and ejecting the aerosolized particulates.
[01:57:15.961 --> 01:57:19.342]  So your question is what on that subject?
[01:57:20.323 --> 01:57:21.703]  Oh, my question is just
[01:57:22.324 --> 01:57:27.805]  It's more of an observation in that the towers exploded outward, level by level, downward.
[01:57:27.905 --> 01:57:29.126]  Yeah, I'll get him to comment on that.
[01:57:29.186 --> 01:57:29.946]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:30.446 --> 01:57:32.366]  Professor Stephen Jones and your call straight ahead.
[01:57:34.067 --> 01:57:38.328]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.368 --> 01:57:38.628]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.212 --> 01:57:52.273]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.973 --> 01:57:54.154]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.734 --> 01:57:55.595]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.315 --> 01:57:57.175]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.195 --> 01:58:01.558]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.058 --> 01:58:06.161]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.641 --> 01:58:08.882]  We must expose 9-11.
[01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:13.865]  This is an inside job because all the evidence and history and eyewitnesses and the science show it.
[01:58:14.594 --> 01:58:23.340]  But just as important, the globalists, the New World Order, will continue to use 9-11 as a pretext for global domination and domestic oppression if we don't expose it.
[01:58:24.121 --> 01:58:27.663]  They're saying Hezbollah and Hamas may strike the U.S.
[01:58:27.703 --> 01:58:29.264]  any minute, give up all your rights.
[01:58:29.865 --> 01:58:35.849]  If there is an attack, we've got to look first who has the motive, and that's the globalists, our government, the criminal elements therein.
[01:58:37.130 --> 01:58:39.892]  We're going to have open phones later in this hour, and we've got a lot of people holding.
[01:58:39.932 --> 01:58:41.873]  Professor Stephen Jones graciously joins us.
[01:58:41.893 --> 01:58:46.035]  He's there with his family for the birth of a new grandchild.
[01:58:46.675 --> 01:58:50.938]  And he joins us from the East Coast this time, not from his normal abode, his normal haunt of
[01:58:52.509 --> 01:58:52.889]  We're good to go.
[01:59:14.671 --> 01:59:18.994]  And we'll explain what that is, and he joins us now for the Balance of the Hour.
[01:59:19.374 --> 01:59:22.196]  It was really wonderful getting to see him again in person.
[01:59:22.416 --> 01:59:28.320]  I met him in Chicago, interviewed him before that, first radio show to interview him, after he went public in the Salt Lake City paper.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:35.184]  And then we had him as a keynote speaker, of course, in Los Angeles, and he is just such a wonderful person, along with his wife, so we appreciate this time.
[01:59:35.464 --> 01:59:37.145]  Professor Jones, good to have you on with us!
[01:59:37.706 --> 01:59:39.127]  Hi Alex, good to be here.
[01:59:39.167 --> 01:59:42.889]  Yeah, I remember having dinner with you there, and
[01:59:43.368 --> 01:59:50.031]  Los Angeles, I really enjoyed that and your conference and your good-heartedness to me and my wife.
[01:59:50.051 --> 01:59:51.492]  I appreciate that very much.
[01:59:51.692 --> 01:59:52.773]  Oh no, you guys are great.
[01:59:52.793 --> 01:59:53.953]  It was wonderful having you there.
[01:59:53.993 --> 01:59:54.633]  We're so honored.
[01:59:55.374 --> 01:59:56.734]  We've got a few minutes before we break.
[01:59:57.235 --> 02:00:00.876]  I know you've been continuing to test samples and going through that.
[02:00:00.896 --> 02:00:05.759]  I'd like to talk about some of the information on Thermite and Thermate.
[02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:09.961]  But what are some of the other issues or anything else you'd like to discuss today concerning 9-11?
[02:00:11.053 --> 02:00:12.434]  Okay, good question.
[02:00:12.654 --> 02:00:14.275]  Hey, let me interject one thing.
[02:00:14.375 --> 02:00:15.595]  Actually, I'm back in Utah.
[02:00:16.275 --> 02:00:17.296]  I'm wrong!
[02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:19.417]  Okay, last week when we shut you up... I know.
[02:00:19.997 --> 02:00:21.478]  I've been traveling like crazy.
[02:00:21.898 --> 02:00:22.638]  But yeah, I'm back.
[02:00:23.158 --> 02:00:25.179]  And so... How'd the birth go?
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:26.200]  It went well.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:27.761]  Little girl.
[02:00:28.061 --> 02:00:28.721]  Oh boy.
[02:00:29.101 --> 02:00:31.162]  Emily Kaya is her name.
[02:00:31.482 --> 02:00:35.004]  And we're just pleased as punch with her.
[02:00:35.124 --> 02:00:37.545]  She's just a beautiful little baby.
[02:00:38.005 --> 02:00:39.826]  How many children and grandchildren do you have?
[02:00:40.698 --> 02:00:43.540]  Well, Alex, we're prolific.
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:48.903]  We have seven children and three grandchildren so far.
[02:00:49.103 --> 02:00:50.084]  You are so blessed.
[02:00:50.604 --> 02:00:51.945]  We are deeply blessed.
[02:00:52.005 --> 02:00:52.626]  I'm envious.
[02:00:53.686 --> 02:00:55.407]  We're really pleased with our family.
[02:00:55.728 --> 02:01:07.115]  I'll tell you what I've been thinking about recently a lot, Alex, is the discussion that Secretary of Transportation Mineta
[02:01:07.972 --> 02:01:22.283]  Discussed when he was down in the bunker beneath the White House and saw Cheney there, you know, and he and Minetta Discussed this before the 9-11 Commission, but they failed to put it in their report, but I think it's just key to understanding
[02:01:23.702 --> 02:01:27.743]  It's just an insight of what happened, really, on 9-11.
[02:01:27.923 --> 02:01:32.484]  I know you're well aware of the story, but... Yeah, we've got the Minetta clip somewhere in the computer at the network.
[02:01:32.504 --> 02:01:36.406]  If you can't find it, guys, we will instant message you the Minetta testimony.
[02:01:36.426 --> 02:01:37.686]  Please continue, Professor.
[02:01:37.746 --> 02:01:38.846]  Okay, it's amazing.
[02:01:38.866 --> 02:01:48.989]  You know, where he's saying that he's there, this young man comes in and asks Cheney, who's in charge, you remember President Bush was in Florida,
[02:01:49.690 --> 02:01:54.271]  By this time I suppose he's flying around somewhere and didn't get back to Washington for a number of hours.
[02:01:54.871 --> 02:02:00.453]  So Cheney's in charge and this young man comes in and says, the plane is 50 miles out.
[02:02:01.293 --> 02:02:02.613]  Do the orders still stand?
[02:02:02.633 --> 02:02:09.355]  Now he's referring to the plane that's heading towards the Pentagon and Cheney says, of course the orders still stand.
[02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:11.776]  Now 50 miles out is plenty of time.
[02:02:12.396 --> 02:02:16.657]  Plenty of distance and corresponding time to scramble, jet,
[02:02:17.615 --> 02:02:19.096]  And intercept this plane.
[02:02:19.216 --> 02:02:19.556]  Stay there.
[02:02:19.576 --> 02:02:21.216]  Let's start over with this when we get back.
[02:02:21.296 --> 02:02:26.658]  Because this is another key area that really shows us how 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:02:26.999 --> 02:02:31.000]  And this just leaks out in front of everyone and then hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.341]  So I'm glad that you're bringing it up.
[02:02:33.121 --> 02:02:35.402]  Professor Stephen Jones is our guest.
[02:02:35.462 --> 02:02:36.462]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:02:36.502 --> 02:02:39.423]  It is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:39.443 --> 02:02:41.384]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:02:48.502 --> 02:02:48.963]  It's here!
[02:02:49.203 --> 02:02:53.987]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.347 --> 02:03:02.013]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.694 --> 02:03:09.739]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.139 --> 02:03:16.985]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.495 --> 02:03:21.598]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.859 --> 02:03:25.361]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.822 --> 02:03:27.743]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.084 --> 02:03:32.007]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:48.588]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:48.868 --> 02:03:52.370]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.450 --> 02:03:56.392]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.632 --> 02:04:02.795]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:03.196 --> 02:04:11.100]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:16.862]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:17.022 --> 02:04:20.783]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.144 --> 02:04:23.004]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[02:04:23.064 --> 02:04:25.225]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:25.465 --> 02:04:30.727]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.767 --> 02:04:36.209]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:39.170 --> 02:04:40.953]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:44.728 --> 02:04:50.510]  September 11, 2001 changed the world, and the world is now realizing that the official story of that infamous day just doesn't make sense.
[02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:55.152]  The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that there is a government cover-up, according to a CNN poll.
[02:04:55.172 --> 02:05:04.295]  9-11 In Plain Sight, the director's cut, is a compilation of unaltered news footage and photos from major networks and publications that raises questions that officials dare not ask, let alone answer.
[02:05:04.655 --> 02:05:12.578]  The worldwide firestorm of questions raised has forced some into a position of desperation damage control to keep this documentary from being seen or accepted by the masses.
[02:05:13.118 --> 02:05:17.779]  Why have these efforts been made to keep you from seeing this documentary and simply asking common sense questions?
[02:05:18.079 --> 02:05:18.439]  Find out.
[02:05:18.699 --> 02:05:23.020]  You must see 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut and share it with as many people as possible.
[02:05:23.380 --> 02:05:26.541]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your copy.
[02:05:26.801 --> 02:05:28.321]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:05:29.941 --> 02:05:33.982]  Unless these questions are answered honestly, the world could be plunged into a third world war.
[02:05:34.322 --> 02:05:34.983]  Stop this madness.
[02:05:35.003 --> 02:05:37.083]  Call 877-817-9829 today and order your copy of 9-11 In Plain Sight The Director's Cut.
[02:05:45.143 --> 02:05:52.885]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.366 --> 02:06:10.371]  Professor Stephen E. Jones, professor of physics, written for some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed national periodicals, joins us and he has exposed the fact that explosive charges were in the towers.
[02:06:10.791 --> 02:06:11.691]  He then got samples
[02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:16.562]  Clearly, thermite, not just thermite, but the type used in demolition, thermate, patented.
[02:06:18.123 --> 02:06:25.850]  But, I also just offhandedly mentioned in the last segment for stations that just joined us, I said, Professor, any other facets of 9-11 you'd like to discuss?
[02:06:26.250 --> 02:06:34.217]  And he brought up one that we focused a lot on that hasn't really gotten enough attention, and that's Norman Mineta, the Secretary of Transportation, before
[02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:36.250]  I have some good news for you.
[02:06:36.290 --> 02:06:38.130]  It's been almost four weeks
[02:06:58.019 --> 02:07:00.960]  And it will be four weeks on Saturday.
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:06.802]  Guess what C-SPAN now says is in the queue on their internal schedule, not posted yet.
[02:07:06.822 --> 02:07:09.222]  They normally post two days before, so that sounds accurate.
[02:07:09.842 --> 02:07:13.984]  Our roundtable panel discussion is airing 8 p.m.
[02:07:14.164 --> 02:07:22.146]  Eastern this Saturday on C-SPAN One on American Perspectives and then supposedly will air two more times after that.
[02:07:22.882 --> 02:07:26.364]  Though they told us last week it might be the next weekend, now they're saying it's confirmed.
[02:07:26.384 --> 02:07:30.705]  But when Alberto Gonzalez is on Washington Journal tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.
[02:07:30.785 --> 02:07:41.310]  Eastern, be sure and call in on the C-SPAN Lines on C-SPAN 1 and say, well, Mr. Torture Memos, are you aware they're going to have a piece on 9-11 this weekend?
[02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:43.370]  Maybe you shouldn't even bring it up.
[02:07:43.410 --> 02:07:47.011]  He may order it cancelled, but expose this individual.
[02:07:47.671 --> 02:07:50.032]  So, is that not exciting, Professor Jones?
[02:07:50.052 --> 02:07:50.532]  It is exciting.
[02:07:50.872 --> 02:07:59.554]  You know, I thought, Alex, after we had that panel discussion with you and me and three others there, just great discussion we had.
[02:08:01.194 --> 02:08:09.076]  I thought that was just such a powerful summary of the conference and our effort here to get out the 9-11 truth.
[02:08:10.987 --> 02:08:13.390]  So I'm so pleased that they're finally going to show that.
[02:08:13.410 --> 02:08:15.432]  Of course, it's been a month, you know.
[02:08:15.893 --> 02:08:17.855]  But nevertheless, get that out.
[02:08:17.935 --> 02:08:20.538]  That'll reach a lot of people.
[02:08:20.879 --> 02:08:24.223]  Well, we'll... Yeah, and then they'll turn to the web and...
[02:08:24.625 --> 02:08:26.066]  That's where they'll get the answers, you know.
[02:08:26.327 --> 02:08:28.809]  Well, we'll see if they edit it, or we'll see if they even air it.
[02:08:29.369 --> 02:08:31.291]  And I know they've gotten thousands of phone calls.
[02:08:31.331 --> 02:08:32.232]  They've told us that.
[02:08:32.312 --> 02:08:33.853]  We haven't even really pushed calls yet.
[02:08:33.893 --> 02:08:36.155]  We just started saying, call into the live shows.
[02:08:36.675 --> 02:08:38.397]  Let's play this Norman Mineta piece.
[02:08:38.857 --> 02:08:40.038]  What is this we're about to hear?
[02:08:40.078 --> 02:08:42.260]  Because this is the exchange you just mentioned.
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:43.662]  Set this up for people, Professor.
[02:08:43.862 --> 02:08:44.122]  Okay.
[02:08:44.542 --> 02:08:52.189]  Well, the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, provided this testimony before the 9-11 Commission.
[02:08:53.061 --> 02:08:58.544]  And of course the 9-11 Commission was commissioned to find out about 9-11.
[02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:03.007]  They said in their report this gives the most comprehensive details and so on.
[02:09:03.707 --> 02:09:13.012]  And so he's going to testify of what happened in the Emergency Operations Center under the White House the morning of 9-11.
[02:09:14.653 --> 02:09:19.716]  And then later that day they moved to Site R and some similar reports came out of there.
[02:09:19.736 --> 02:09:21.797]  So let's go ahead and, please continue.
[02:09:24.883 --> 02:09:35.186]  Let me just say that the fact that they didn't put it in the 9-11 Commission Report underlines the importance and significance of what Mineta says, right?
[02:09:36.287 --> 02:09:45.809]  Did you know the day after this testimony came out on Fox News a few weeks ago, I guess about a month ago, when Professor Fetcher went on Fox News, he brought this up?
[02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:47.069]  Yes, he did.
[02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:48.850]  And the next day, Mineta resigned.
[02:09:49.352 --> 02:09:49.712]  Right.
[02:09:50.073 --> 02:09:50.833]  Isn't that something?
[02:09:51.093 --> 02:09:52.694]  So I think this is an important thing.
[02:09:52.754 --> 02:10:08.725]  I was really pleased that Jim Fetzer brought that up, because to me this is one of the more significant testimonies that the Commission got presented to them, and the fact they didn't put it in their report underlines how important it is.
[02:10:08.825 --> 02:10:10.006]  Let's go ahead and roll this clip.
[02:10:10.026 --> 02:10:10.666]  Here it is, folks.
[02:10:11.947 --> 02:10:17.571]  I wanted to focus just a moment on the Presidential Emergency Operating Center.
[02:10:19.016 --> 02:10:21.517]  You were there for a good part of the day.
[02:10:21.557 --> 02:10:23.338]  I think you were there with the Vice President.
[02:10:24.638 --> 02:10:26.539]  And we had that order given.
[02:10:26.599 --> 02:10:36.683]  I think it was by the President that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists.
[02:10:38.484 --> 02:10:40.305]  Were you there when that order was given?
[02:10:40.325 --> 02:10:42.646]  No, I was not.
[02:10:42.666 --> 02:10:48.088]  I was made aware of it during the time that the airplane coming in
[02:10:48.783 --> 02:10:49.664]  To the Pentagon.
[02:10:51.045 --> 02:10:56.609]  There was a young man who would come in and say to the vice president, the plane is 50 miles out.
[02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:58.751]  The plane is 30 miles out.
[02:10:59.592 --> 02:11:02.394]  And when he got down to the plane is 10 miles out.
[02:11:04.816 --> 02:11:09.099]  The young man also said to the vice president, do the orders still stand?
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:17.326]  And the vice president turned and whipped his neck around and said, of course, the orders still stand.
[02:11:17.952 --> 02:11:19.593]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[02:11:19.613 --> 02:11:26.718]  Well, at the time I didn't know what all that meant.
[02:11:26.958 --> 02:11:30.780]  Okay, so there's Lee Hamilton trying to bring in some propaganda here.
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:41.827]  By the way, the default position since 1957 when ORAB was set up was for generals and admirals to be able to order, or their designate colonels, the shoot-down of errant passenger jetliners.
[02:11:41.867 --> 02:11:42.467]  That was the case in 1999.
[02:11:43.488 --> 02:11:43.688]  Yeah.
[02:11:43.728 --> 02:11:43.908]  So, right.
[02:11:43.988 --> 02:11:44.809]  And incidentally, that
[02:12:09.611 --> 02:12:19.437]  The power that you said to order scrambling of jets was removed from the military brass and it was restored shortly after 9-11.
[02:12:20.078 --> 02:12:20.578]  I understand.
[02:12:20.618 --> 02:12:21.979]  So you know, it's just this window.
[02:12:22.999 --> 02:12:29.163]  It certainly provides strong evidence that these men knew the hijackers were coming.
[02:12:29.203 --> 02:12:34.907]  Well, just like 9-11, two months before 9-11, they lowered the security to all-time lows on the World Trade Center.
[02:12:34.947 --> 02:12:35.367]  Oops, sorry.
[02:12:35.547 --> 02:12:37.188]  Please continue.
[02:12:37.208 --> 02:12:37.808]  No problem, Alex.
[02:12:39.729 --> 02:12:44.531]  The plane's coming towards the Pentagon, Mineta says, 50 miles out.
[02:12:44.651 --> 02:12:46.792]  Now, 50 miles, I did a quick calculation.
[02:12:46.832 --> 02:12:49.573]  You've got about 12 minutes, plus or minus.
[02:12:49.773 --> 02:12:51.353]  We don't know the exact speed of the jet.
[02:12:52.054 --> 02:13:01.097]  But it only takes, in Washington, D.C., three or four to scramble a jet and join up an escort, an errant
[02:13:01.997 --> 02:13:03.358]  hijacked plane.
[02:13:03.558 --> 02:13:16.422]  This is almost two hours into the quote flights being hijacked with scrambled jets in the air plus I've been to DC I've seen the missile launchers back in the late nineties when I was last there on top of the Pentagon so this is all a joke.
[02:13:16.943 --> 02:13:22.465]  Yeah you know so if the orders still stand to shoot down the plane well then why wasn't it shot down?
[02:13:22.705 --> 02:13:24.586]  It wasn't so it must not be that.
[02:13:25.166 --> 02:13:28.367]  It must be something else and of course the plane did hit the Pentagon
[02:13:30.432 --> 02:13:31.573]  Or whatever did, yeah.
[02:13:31.793 --> 02:13:32.633]  Whatever, sure.
[02:13:32.673 --> 02:13:51.177]  But anyway, what it leads me to is the air defenses were down, and here we have Minetta basically saying, you know, something, you know, these orders that the Vice President is talking about still stand.
[02:13:51.237 --> 02:13:52.937]  This young man, why was he worried?
[02:13:53.698 --> 02:13:55.579]  About these orders standing.
[02:13:55.819 --> 02:14:02.222]  If there was a shoot-down order, doesn't common sense logic show that if there was a shoot-down order, he'd be calm and hope the planes would get it?
[02:14:02.642 --> 02:14:04.203]  Only would he be saying, does it still stand?
[02:14:04.223 --> 02:14:06.024]  Does it still stand as it's coming in?
[02:14:06.044 --> 02:14:07.204]  I mean, that makes perfect sense.
[02:14:07.944 --> 02:14:08.905]  Yep, absolutely.
[02:14:09.265 --> 02:14:20.190]  So, you know, I'm saying, well, as people look at this and realize that people were killed in the Pentagon, something hit that building and killed a lot of people.
[02:14:21.051 --> 02:14:23.472]  Why don't they say, well, what are these orders?
[02:14:23.512 --> 02:14:33.196]  In fact, why didn't the Commission pursue this and say, wait a minute, you mean the Vice President said there's orders standing and yet the plane hit the Pentagon?
[02:14:33.216 --> 02:14:37.378]  We've got to get finding out what these orders are.
[02:14:37.838 --> 02:14:42.820]  Instead, they didn't even put the testimony of Secretary Mineta into the
[02:14:44.821 --> 02:14:45.761]  9-11 Commission report.
[02:14:45.781 --> 02:14:47.282]  A glaring omission.
[02:14:47.522 --> 02:14:48.643]  And that's a key omission.
[02:14:48.663 --> 02:14:51.044]  I wonder who that young man is.
[02:14:51.084 --> 02:14:53.625]  I wonder if he's still alive or if he's fallen down and hurt his head.
[02:14:54.346 --> 02:15:00.829]  Well, you know, this is the sort of thing that needs to be followed up on in a real investigation.
[02:15:00.909 --> 02:15:03.811]  If the Commission had done that, they would have had that young man in there.
[02:15:03.991 --> 02:15:04.892]  You know, what is this?
[02:15:05.472 --> 02:15:05.932]  Tell us about it.
[02:15:05.952 --> 02:15:07.153]  They would have had the Vice President in there.
[02:15:07.953 --> 02:15:11.435]  And they would have had him under oath instead of, you know, letting him testify like
[02:15:13.542 --> 02:15:17.927]  The President Bush did testify that he refused to do it under oath, right?
[02:15:18.909 --> 02:15:24.155]  And he insisted that Vice President Cheney be there when he talked to the Commission.
[02:15:24.195 --> 02:15:26.057]  I mean, and that was behind closed doors.
[02:15:26.097 --> 02:15:27.899]  And, you know, it's just fishy.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:28.841]  A lot of it.
[02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:31.544]  We need to have some proper investigation.
[02:15:32.312 --> 02:15:33.393]  I think we can all agree to that.
[02:15:33.453 --> 02:15:40.198]  And when Bush and Cheney came out from that little hour meeting, they were laughing and giggling and saying it was great, they had fun, they had some good discussions.
[02:15:40.218 --> 02:15:43.460]  I mean, it's always this improper decorum.
[02:15:47.043 --> 02:15:57.290]  And then when the Commission had their report, that went through the White House and they still deleted or classified or whatever they did.
[02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:58.771]  They prevented from twenty
[02:15:59.554 --> 02:16:01.515]  Plus pages from being in the report.
[02:16:01.555 --> 02:16:04.055]  It might have included the Minetta testimony, I don't know.
[02:16:04.955 --> 02:16:08.616]  But anyway, they obviously were covering up something there.
[02:16:09.376 --> 02:16:11.237]  Something else slipped out, probably even bigger.
[02:16:11.837 --> 02:16:12.097]  Yeah.
[02:16:12.777 --> 02:16:17.999]  So, you know, I think we've got lots of evidence, is the whole point, Alex.
[02:16:18.099 --> 02:16:18.739]  I know we do.
[02:16:19.599 --> 02:16:25.421]  And the question is, what do we do about, you know, traveling across the country by car?
[02:16:27.857 --> 02:16:37.143]  It gives you a lot of time to think and of course my wife was there and she's persuaded as I am that 9-11 was an inside job that we have real problems.
[02:16:38.324 --> 02:16:41.086]  And so the question is, what do you do?
[02:16:41.106 --> 02:16:44.328]  I know there are many people concerned about this.
[02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:47.451]  One of the things obviously we do is what you're doing.
[02:16:47.671 --> 02:16:49.292]  And by the way, she's a great admirer of you.
[02:16:49.492 --> 02:16:51.113]  I admire you guys, please.
[02:16:51.153 --> 02:16:51.894]  We love that.
[02:16:53.112 --> 02:16:55.354]  New video of yours that you showed at the L.A.
[02:16:55.414 --> 02:16:57.995]  conference of the false flag operations.
[02:16:58.075 --> 02:16:58.816]  Oh, Terror Storm!
[02:16:58.856 --> 02:16:59.196]  Thank you!
[02:16:59.416 --> 02:17:00.157]  Oh, Terror Storm.
[02:17:00.177 --> 02:17:01.758]  That was just powerful.
[02:17:03.039 --> 02:17:05.480]  Anyway, so we get the word out.
[02:17:05.821 --> 02:17:13.446]  I just wanted to say something about the number of researchers who are out there
[02:17:14.721 --> 02:17:19.204]  I mean, they don't get much credit usually, but boy, there's a lot of good people out there.
[02:17:19.324 --> 02:17:32.453]  Well, let's talk about them when we get back, Professor, and then get into some of the new developments and recap what's happening with the thermite, because that is so central, and your research is just getting approved, approved, confirmed, confirmed down the line with the scientific method.
[02:17:32.593 --> 02:17:43.460]  And also, we'll give out the website for people to check out your detailed and growing findings in that report that you've put together there on the Brigham Young website.
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:51.366]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.

[02:19:45.638 --> 02:19:47.259]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:47.379 --> 02:19:51.500]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:54.501]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:54.581 --> 02:20:01.263]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:01.463 --> 02:20:04.464]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:04.684 --> 02:20:07.065]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:07.205 --> 02:20:17.349]  Like murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as apcozine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[02:20:17.549 --> 02:20:26.671]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:20:26.831 --> 02:20:34.593]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:53.761]  Professor Steven Jones is our guest.
[02:21:53.821 --> 02:21:58.242]  In the last 15 minutes of this hour, we'll take some calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:21:58.262 --> 02:22:04.304]  Professor, I lay it out before you, we're honored to have you here, whatever you'd like to cover concerning the thermite or anything else.
[02:22:04.625 --> 02:22:12.207]  But first off, you wanted to talk about some of the other great researchers, over 300 plus scholars now, members of 9-11 Scholars for Truth.
[02:22:12.707 --> 02:22:14.948]  Please tell us about some of these other great people.
[02:22:15.748 --> 02:22:20.190]  Right, and you know, people all over the world really, Alex, who are
[02:22:21.061 --> 02:22:23.061]  Studying this, getting data.
[02:22:23.842 --> 02:22:31.583]  I mean, I got an email this morning from Robert Moore, probably never heard of him, but he's just does great research.
[02:22:31.864 --> 02:22:33.144]  I don't know where he finds the time.
[02:22:34.064 --> 02:22:41.746]  He sent me a photo of, I'm just going to quote this, mounted linear thermite cutting device.
[02:22:42.326 --> 02:22:50.268]  That's a mouthful, but so, and it's actually a drawing and this thing has been tested and he's trying to get the
[02:22:51.559 --> 02:22:52.200]  video clip.
[02:22:52.220 --> 02:22:53.521]  So this company makes these.
[02:22:54.522 --> 02:22:57.644]  And what they have is thermite.
[02:22:59.466 --> 02:23:14.439]  See, anyway, it's the layers of thermite and refractory material, but in sandwich, but getting to the point here, Alex, that it uses thermite, you slap it on a structural steel beam and
[02:23:15.191 --> 02:23:15.491]  Wham!
[02:23:15.551 --> 02:23:18.994]  You can cut right through the structural steel.
[02:23:19.214 --> 02:23:29.081]  I was sent a photo about a week ago and didn't even do anything with it off of a construction site that showed them at an angle putting these devices on the pillars to cut them.
[02:23:29.661 --> 02:23:30.942]  And I didn't even do anything with that.
[02:23:30.982 --> 02:23:32.543]  I mean, we're wallowing in this evidence.
[02:23:32.563 --> 02:23:32.803]  Go ahead.
[02:23:32.823 --> 02:23:33.064]  We are.
[02:23:33.524 --> 02:23:34.224]  We have so many.
[02:23:34.284 --> 02:23:38.547]  And these researchers, you know, finding these photos and pulling in information.
[02:23:38.647 --> 02:23:39.928]  I'm sure I saw the same one.
[02:23:40.569 --> 02:23:43.731]  And there's Nila Sagadevan, you know, who sent me that one.
[02:23:44.289 --> 02:23:51.034]  And here you have that that was a standard RDX, I think, but you can do it with the super thermite as well.
[02:23:51.094 --> 02:23:54.297]  The linear thermite cutting device would work as well.
[02:23:55.177 --> 02:24:06.666]  Anyway, you put it typically at an angle, so that as you slice through the steel, now the column above is no longer supported because it's cut at about a 45 degree angle.
[02:24:06.706 --> 02:24:10.489]  See, now the upper column can slide, so you've weakened the building.
[02:24:11.038 --> 02:24:16.141]  You do enough of those, and then you get the explosions near the top to get a tamper.
[02:24:16.442 --> 02:24:19.143]  Well, that's the way conventional demolitions are done.
[02:24:20.404 --> 02:24:30.471]  And so things are falling into place here, and a lot of the credit has to go to these people that we hardly ever hear about, you know, doing this research.
[02:24:30.991 --> 02:24:39.337]  Well, it's almost like we're an organic giant intelligence agency, because we're all double-checking each other's facts, we're all scanning everything, it's moving faster and faster.
[02:24:39.975 --> 02:24:41.055]  That's exactly right.
[02:24:41.095 --> 02:24:42.176]  That's a good way to put it.
[02:24:42.816 --> 02:24:47.438]  You know, this growing body of researchers and we communicate.
[02:24:47.518 --> 02:24:52.039]  Some are good at communication, I would say, like yourself.
[02:24:52.059 --> 02:24:58.222]  And others just get in there and they find these photos and they, you know, how are controlled demolitions done?
[02:24:58.282 --> 02:25:03.064]  Let's get a picture of these linear cutting devices just held with rubber bands.
[02:25:03.704 --> 02:25:04.164]  Amazing.
[02:25:05.304 --> 02:25:06.845]  On the steel columns, you know.
[02:25:07.877 --> 02:25:13.400]  And in some cases, just a giant rubber band holds this linear cutting device.
[02:25:13.781 --> 02:25:26.308]  And then here comes Robert Moore with the Thermite linear cutting device, you know, and he's going to see if he can get them to release, the company that does these, to release a video of their test of this.
[02:25:27.589 --> 02:25:30.110]  I wonder if they had any big orders right before 9-11?
[02:25:30.130 --> 02:25:31.611]  Well, you know, I hope not.
[02:25:34.045 --> 02:25:35.025]  You know, it's another thing.
[02:25:35.045 --> 02:25:39.527]  You say, well, man, as we talk about these things, maybe we'll dry up some of our sources.
[02:25:39.547 --> 02:25:41.048]  And that is a concern.
[02:25:41.108 --> 02:25:44.710]  But he is actively pursuing it.
[02:25:44.730 --> 02:25:48.911]  And I hope I'm not precluding any of his great work at all there.
[02:25:48.991 --> 02:25:53.473]  But, you know, these people are just going after these questions.
[02:25:53.573 --> 02:26:01.837]  One of the nice things is we have so many researchers that I think, you know, I run into obstacles when I try to get information.
[02:26:02.461 --> 02:26:08.806]  Like, well, the obvious one, the release of the surveillance tapes, what hit the Pentagon.
[02:26:08.826 --> 02:26:10.608]  You know, we've all run into that barrier.
[02:26:11.368 --> 02:26:16.412]  But then, you see all these people.
[02:26:16.773 --> 02:26:18.074]  I don't think we can all be stopped.
[02:26:18.114 --> 02:26:19.275]  That's the nice thing about that.
[02:26:19.635 --> 02:26:22.157]  As we build momentum here, I sense that we do.
[02:26:22.177 --> 02:26:24.098]  Of course, we're getting chatter.
[02:26:28.986 --> 02:26:29.966]  Little hit pieces.
[02:26:30.126 --> 02:26:31.967]  Little hit pieces that bounce off of us.
[02:26:32.387 --> 02:26:33.987]  Yeah, they bounce off of us.
[02:26:34.487 --> 02:26:38.408]  Something nipping at our heels as we run along here.
[02:26:38.608 --> 02:26:45.129]  You know, that obviously you expect, but there just seemed to be an increase of that too, which is, I guess, to be expected.
[02:26:46.109 --> 02:26:52.630]  But, gosh, these guys out in the trenches, you know, digging out the data, communicating to people.
[02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:57.611]  That guy that sang this song for me, I wish his name had come to it.
[02:26:58.106 --> 02:27:01.851]  Mind you, that little song I did in LA, which people enjoyed.
[02:27:01.871 --> 02:27:06.077]  I mean, and he just volunteered to sing that.
[02:27:07.418 --> 02:27:09.519]  So, I mean, all these people, they deserve a lot of credit.
[02:27:09.839 --> 02:27:15.202]  Oh, and when we get back, let's talk about what the people that carried out 9-11 are probably thinking right now.
[02:27:15.242 --> 02:27:15.883]  Your take on that?
[02:27:15.903 --> 02:27:21.266]  I mean, they've got to be concerned, because this hasn't taken us 40 years to expose it like the Kennedy assassination.
[02:27:21.286 --> 02:27:25.328]  We're exposing this exponentially right now, and they can't stop us.
[02:27:25.648 --> 02:27:32.792]  And then we'll get more into the thermite, thermate, and people have been calling in wanting to ask you questions about the difference between the collapse of Tower 1 and 2 and Building 7.
[02:27:33.493 --> 02:27:33.913]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.033 --> 02:27:39.018]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.959 --> 02:27:42.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.334 --> 02:27:48.676]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[02:28:45.692 --> 02:28:48.713]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:28:49.013 --> 02:28:53.936]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.196 --> 02:28:58.557]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.838 --> 02:29:07.761]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.961 --> 02:29:11.583]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.883 --> 02:29:16.911]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.211 --> 02:29:23.942]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:29:24.423 --> 02:29:24.963]  What about you?
[02:29:25.718 --> 02:29:31.059]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:45.564 --> 02:29:52.826]  United States Pharmacopeia, USP, sets the standard for most food supplements and are used in over 95% of all vitamin and mineral supplements in the world.
[02:29:53.006 --> 02:29:56.047]  The problem is that these products have never appeared in any living tissue.
[02:29:56.167 --> 02:29:59.528]  They're created in laboratories and are not recognizable to the body's metabolism.
[02:29:59.968 --> 02:30:08.850]  Grown by Nature products are different because they use re-natured ingredients, proprietary blends of essential vitamins and minerals, with co-factors of proteins, lipids, and complex carbohydrates.
[02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:15.636]  Over 50 studies have been conducted on renatured nutrients, and over 20 have been published in peer-reviewed journals proclaiming their superiority.
[02:30:15.976 --> 02:30:20.521]  As a result, grown-by-nature vitamins and supplements are now recognized as simply the best available.
[02:30:20.901 --> 02:30:21.121]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:21.141 --> 02:30:22.683]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your grown-by-nature products today!
[02:30:28.528 --> 02:30:32.354]  We are what we eat, and since we are of nature, we should eat foods in their natural form.
[02:30:32.694 --> 02:30:35.679]  Only Grown by Nature offers a full line of re-natured nutrients.
[02:30:35.699 --> 02:30:35.919]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:36.019 --> 02:30:38.723]  That's 877-817-9829 because not all products are grown by nature, but they should be.
[02:30:53.018 --> 02:30:56.041]  My new film Terrorist Storm is out without the extras.
[02:30:56.061 --> 02:30:58.523]  The official DVD comes out in about two and a half, three weeks.
[02:30:59.363 --> 02:31:07.010]  But we've got some copies left of the American Scholar Symposium edition that is even a few minutes longer than the final edition you'll be seeing.
[02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:09.032]  But it doesn't have the extras on it.
[02:31:09.212 --> 02:31:09.532]  It's $19.95.
[02:31:09.592 --> 02:31:12.855]  Just get it to start making copies so you can get it out to people.
[02:31:13.388 --> 02:31:15.428]  Available at Infowars.com.
[02:31:15.488 --> 02:31:16.129]  Terror Storm.
[02:31:16.169 --> 02:31:16.829]  We cannot wait.
[02:31:16.849 --> 02:31:17.449]  You need to get it.
[02:31:17.469 --> 02:31:18.609]  It really is waking people up.
[02:31:19.109 --> 02:31:20.309]  It's the best film I've ever made.
[02:31:20.349 --> 02:31:21.670]  The most professional.
[02:31:22.410 --> 02:31:24.230]  Had a composer and a little symphony.
[02:31:24.390 --> 02:31:25.390]  Do the music for it.
[02:31:26.371 --> 02:31:27.111]  Great graphics.
[02:31:27.171 --> 02:31:28.811]  But it's the information that's powerful.
[02:31:28.831 --> 02:31:32.932]  And of course, Professor Jones is in the film talking about the thermite, Therm-8.
[02:31:33.332 --> 02:31:34.492]  Just about five minutes of the film.
[02:31:34.512 --> 02:31:38.253]  He did a great job to give you an idea of what's in this almost two hour film.
[02:31:39.033 --> 02:31:46.038]  The toll-free number to call and get Terror Storm or any of my other videos or books is 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:31:46.158 --> 02:32:00.108]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and see all 15 of my films, my weekly TV reports, most of the 9-11 Scholar Symposium is now posted up there including Professor Jones' presentation.
[02:32:00.829 --> 02:32:02.410]  15 cents a day just to pay for the bandwidth.
[02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:04.291]  That's PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:32:06.296 --> 02:32:19.962]  Professor Jones, what do you think the individuals that carried out the attacks, clearly on the inside, are going to do now that their attack pieces against yourself, myself, and many others are so ineffective?
[02:32:19.982 --> 02:32:25.884]  And in major polls, half the American people believe it's an inside job now, and it is growing rapidly.
[02:32:26.184 --> 02:32:27.345]  What do you think they'll try to pull?
[02:32:28.045 --> 02:32:31.067]  Well, you know, two things come to mind, Alex.
[02:32:31.247 --> 02:32:31.587]  One is,
[02:32:33.493 --> 02:32:37.014]  The internet is, to a large extent, how we're getting the word out.
[02:32:37.034 --> 02:32:39.335]  Of course, we've got radio, DVDs, those are great.
[02:32:40.035 --> 02:32:44.536]  I'm concerned that there may be some effort to control the internet.
[02:32:44.796 --> 02:32:50.398]  Actually, it's mentioned in their PMAC strategy back in 2000, they want to control cyberspace.
[02:32:51.158 --> 02:32:56.059]  So fortunately, they haven't done that, but that's one thing I think we need to be concerned about.
[02:32:56.239 --> 02:33:00.021]  You're right, they're moving with internet taxes, regulations, speech control.
[02:33:02.126 --> 02:33:11.930]  And the second thing, of course, is just this whole notion of another 9-11, another false flag operation.
[02:33:13.291 --> 02:33:24.676]  As we look at this Lebanese-Israeli conflict, I worry, I'm sure you've thought about this too, that they might take advantage of this and have some sort of
[02:33:26.507 --> 02:33:33.711]  Well, the federal government and the Israelis are saying, we just want to tell you there's a good chance Hezbollah and Hamas are going to blow something up.
[02:33:33.791 --> 02:33:35.732]  Oh yeah, to bring us into war, sure.
[02:33:35.852 --> 02:33:38.013]  See, that's exactly what I'm worried about.
[02:33:39.494 --> 02:33:44.117]  I mean, it could be on American soil, but it could just easily be on American citizens over there.
[02:33:44.437 --> 02:33:45.217]  Could be a ship.
[02:33:45.718 --> 02:33:46.998]  Yeah, a ship or something.
[02:33:47.519 --> 02:33:51.561]  Where they would then implicate Iran and of course Syria as being
[02:33:52.162 --> 02:33:53.682]  You know, supporters of Hezbollah.
[02:33:53.702 --> 02:33:55.583]  Now we've got to attack Iran and Syria.
[02:33:55.623 --> 02:33:59.764]  Boy, I'll tell you, that would be World War III, I think.
[02:34:00.044 --> 02:34:04.085]  Well, Crystal and others, Newt Gingrich, are calling for that.
[02:34:04.485 --> 02:34:05.446]  Yeah, yeah, they are.
[02:34:05.466 --> 02:34:06.546]  It's just blatant.
[02:34:07.246 --> 02:34:08.706]  And I hope people can see.
[02:34:08.726 --> 02:34:09.847]  You know, it's disappointing.
[02:34:09.887 --> 02:34:10.907]  I've talked to a few people.
[02:34:11.716 --> 02:34:16.459]  about this just friends and family and they say, oh wow, I think we need to attack Iran, you know, right?
[02:34:16.519 --> 02:34:19.140]  Sooner the better.
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:20.121]  These are people.
[02:34:20.301 --> 02:34:21.261]  They have families.
[02:34:21.462 --> 02:34:23.143]  You know, we can't just go bomb them.
[02:34:23.483 --> 02:34:24.944]  Do they know what this entails?
[02:34:25.004 --> 02:34:26.404]  Going to war against the Persians?
[02:34:26.865 --> 02:34:30.006]  There's 65 million of them, not 22 million like Iraqis.
[02:34:30.527 --> 02:34:32.548]  And by the way, they know how to shoot straight.
[02:34:33.088 --> 02:34:33.508]  That's right.
[02:34:33.548 --> 02:34:37.751]  And they've got collaborations or alliances, you know, with Russia and China.
[02:34:38.351 --> 02:34:41.353]  I mean, if we get to doing something like that,
[02:34:42.388 --> 02:34:45.689]  attacking Iran, we're going to have our hands full.
[02:34:45.749 --> 02:34:48.370]  It's just somehow this madness has got to stop.
[02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:50.051]  It really is a concern.
[02:34:50.891 --> 02:34:59.654]  And, you know, your terror storm video, I think, did such a good job in presenting the backdrop for these catalyzing operations.
[02:34:59.674 --> 02:35:05.616]  Of course, catalyzing, that's the term that the PNAC used, as they called, or
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:15.282]  Well, I was pleased to see organically from our own perspectives that that was my central speech and that was also part of your central speech.
[02:35:15.302 --> 02:35:16.182]  Yeah, right.
[02:35:16.242 --> 02:35:18.303]  I had that right at the end of my talk as well.
[02:35:18.883 --> 02:35:23.724]  This concern about these catalyzing events and are we going to have another one?
[02:35:23.924 --> 02:35:25.984]  You know, that's the thing.
[02:35:26.044 --> 02:35:34.106]  If there's some way to stop these guys, or at least have people aware so if they pull something like that, immediately there's
[02:35:34.639 --> 02:35:47.542]  Suspicion, investigation, protest, you know, then maybe we can head off some of this synthetic terror that's going on.
[02:35:47.962 --> 02:35:56.384]  I thought Webster Tarpley, you know, at your conference there in LA, Alex, did such a good job describing the synthetic terror also.
[02:35:56.545 --> 02:35:57.485]  Well, he's a genius.
[02:35:57.905 --> 02:35:58.345]  He is.
[02:35:58.445 --> 02:36:02.126]  He's sharp and, gosh, he did such a good job too.
[02:36:03.309 --> 02:36:10.654]  You know, getting back into the thermite, the thermate, you've got other professors looking at it, other physicists, other geologists and archaeometry.
[02:36:13.055 --> 02:36:17.198]  I mean, it's been a few weeks since we last talked, I guess about three or four, since we were there together in person.
[02:36:17.939 --> 02:36:19.480]  Any new colleagues contacting you?
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:20.360]  Any other research?
[02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:24.083]  Any other people in your field that are looking at your research?
[02:36:25.263 --> 02:36:26.424]  Well, of course, three weeks.
[02:36:26.504 --> 02:36:31.767]  I was out with my granddaughter, and then we zipped back.
[02:36:32.867 --> 02:36:35.309]  So there hasn't been a lot new since then.
[02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:36.530]  I bet your email's full.
[02:36:37.231 --> 02:36:38.872]  My email is totally full.
[02:36:39.352 --> 02:36:41.794]  I did do a little email while I was traveling.
[02:36:42.295 --> 02:36:44.797]  But let me tell you one thing that has come to mind.
[02:36:44.857 --> 02:36:50.741]  This is corroborating independent laboratory findings.
[02:36:51.362 --> 02:36:57.967]  This was a group that, let's see, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
[02:36:58.447 --> 02:37:01.490]  This is an appendix C of the FEMA report not mentioned.
[02:37:01.932 --> 02:37:20.484]  In the NIST report, oddly, but, you know, they talk, I'm just going to quote here real briefly, evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the structural steel, on the steel, including sulfidation with intergranular melting.
[02:37:20.664 --> 02:37:26.307]  That's a mouthful, but... Well, jet fuel and paper cannot cause the terms they just used.
[02:37:26.647 --> 02:37:28.028]  That's exactly right.
[02:37:28.669 --> 02:37:29.109]  So what...
[02:37:29.631 --> 02:37:40.199]  And New York Times even commented, they said, perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation, and yet this isn't even in the subsequent NIST report, you know.
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:57.832]  But it does corroborate, you see, this is just what you expect when you use thermate, which is thermite mixed with sulfur, and you get this molten iron, which is your high temperature, and then the sulfur mixed in allows you to have this attack on the steel.
[02:37:58.826 --> 02:37:59.987]  Which is what they reported.
[02:38:00.327 --> 02:38:07.591]  They just didn't know what could cause this, and it's a deep mystery at the time, as New York Times pointed out.
[02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:17.996]  Professor Jones, do you think the globalists, the people behind these attacks, do you think that they overreached, that they didn't realize that this many people would be bold enough to do the research and then go public?
[02:38:18.577 --> 02:38:19.317]  I think you're right.
[02:38:19.837 --> 02:38:20.458]  I really do.
[02:38:21.558 --> 02:38:22.899]  And so quickly, too.
[02:38:23.679 --> 02:38:26.561]  Well, I'm sorry it's not quicker, but I mean, well,
[02:38:27.139 --> 02:38:27.880]  Relatively, yeah.
[02:38:28.260 --> 02:38:30.121]  Relatively, compared historically.
[02:38:30.842 --> 02:38:38.147]  The truth has come out about the Reichstag fire, for example, and the Himmler operation, and the Mukden incident.
[02:38:38.167 --> 02:38:45.313]  You know, we name all these incidents that we know of historically, and you cover more of them in your terror storm.
[02:38:45.793 --> 02:38:55.861]  But the point is, it takes time to ferret out the facts, but I think as a group now, we're getting at these facts more quickly.
[02:38:56.383 --> 02:38:59.124]  Probably a lot more quickly than they expected.
[02:39:00.284 --> 02:39:03.144]  I'm just hoping we can keep this momentum going.
[02:39:03.484 --> 02:39:17.887]  Well, in a way they have to go into Iran or Syria or at least have a big war in Lebanon and hopefully get, you know, they're hoping to get Syria to come into it, which Syria foolishly saying they may now do, but, you know, domestically their politicians have to talk like that or they'd be removed from office.
[02:39:18.167 --> 02:39:22.308]  What would Americans do if we were being attacked and our leaders weren't saying, you know, fight back?
[02:39:22.888 --> 02:39:26.190]  But, you know, I try to calculate what the globalists are going to do.
[02:39:26.290 --> 02:39:31.753]  If they launch another big 9-11, I think that'll blow up in their face, literally, figuratively, so fast, it'll backfire.
[02:39:32.073 --> 02:39:37.576]  But in a way, they've got to up the ante to the next crisis, and I hope to smokescreen all the things that are coming out now.
[02:39:37.616 --> 02:39:40.438]  It seems like we really got them boxed in.
[02:39:40.978 --> 02:39:41.639]  Yeah, right.
[02:39:41.719 --> 02:39:47.022]  And, you know, again, you've got these workers, worker bees, I call them, you know.
[02:39:47.042 --> 02:39:48.983]  I mean, of course, we're all worker bees.
[02:39:49.622 --> 02:39:52.523]  But there's hundreds of us, thousands of us worldwide.
[02:39:52.963 --> 02:39:59.385]  We're not just going to sit back, and the next catalyzing event happens, and say, ooh, this is shock and awe.
[02:40:00.086 --> 02:40:01.046]  I'm terrified.
[02:40:01.166 --> 02:40:03.267]  I'll support whatever wars you want to do.
[02:40:03.647 --> 02:40:03.767]  No.
[02:40:04.267 --> 02:40:10.469]  We're going to be out there taking pictures, collecting samples, the dust immediately.
[02:40:10.489 --> 02:40:14.971]  If there's molten metal involved, some of it will be out there as soon as that solidifies.
[02:40:15.851 --> 02:40:19.012]  Send a sample off to Jones or somebody, and we'll
[02:40:19.605 --> 02:40:31.528]  In other words, I think our eyes are opening, at least among thousands, to where we can be on top of this immediately and get to the bottom of it very quickly.
[02:40:31.768 --> 02:40:35.128]  And that was one of the points you made in your talk.
[02:40:35.388 --> 02:40:41.410]  What do you think of the move, Professor Jones, to fire professors that talk about it being an inside job, even mildly?
[02:40:41.770 --> 02:40:46.331]  The move, I mean, obviously, you know, what we're seeing happen to Barrett.
[02:40:48.311 --> 02:40:49.592]  Good man, Kevin Barrett.
[02:40:50.453 --> 02:40:54.456]  There are moves to make people take 9-11 inside job signs out of their yards.
[02:40:54.777 --> 02:40:57.059]  There seems to be a real move to try to shut us up.
[02:40:57.659 --> 02:40:57.979]  Right.
[02:40:58.380 --> 02:40:59.901]  But you know, it backfires.
[02:41:00.081 --> 02:41:02.063]  I hope it keeps backfiring.
[02:41:02.163 --> 02:41:03.664]  Like Kevin Barrett you mentioned.
[02:41:04.285 --> 02:41:09.710]  His plight and his struggle there to retain his job, as he's talking about 9-11.
[02:41:10.651 --> 02:41:13.373]  Briefly, you know, during his course on Islam.
[02:41:14.025 --> 02:41:38.373]  So, of course, he brings in the war on so-called terror, the so-called war on terror, and he brings in 9-11, and the University of Wisconsin, you know, they had a meeting, they support him, but the media and the, seem to be, well, in other words, it's backfiring, it's getting out, this message is getting out to people who otherwise wouldn't have known about.
[02:41:39.781 --> 02:41:52.271]  Well, that's like Bilderberg had me snatched up when I was in Ottawa, Canada at the Capitol and then that actually backfired and the media even admitted that it wouldn't have been a big story unless it would have happened to me and instead it blew up nationally.
[02:41:52.811 --> 02:41:53.972]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[02:41:54.032 --> 02:42:03.980]  So, you know, we've got enough people now that when something like this happens, man, the word gets out and there's a lot of interest, a lot of feedback, I understand, to
[02:42:07.156 --> 02:42:13.239]  For instance, C-SPAN, when they put out our panel discussion, they'll get feedback immediately.
[02:42:13.259 --> 02:42:16.762]  Of course, they're getting it already, requesting that it be put out.
[02:42:19.623 --> 02:42:22.045]  I think this momentum is going to keep building.
[02:42:24.619 --> 02:42:29.621]  I'm hoping that as a group we can just keep going on this Alex.
[02:42:30.021 --> 02:42:30.582]  I agree with you.
[02:42:30.602 --> 02:42:33.223]  I want to take a few calls right now Professor Jones.
[02:42:33.243 --> 02:42:34.803]  Sure, sure.
[02:42:35.224 --> 02:42:45.068]  We've got a link on InfoWars.com to your growing research paper, but tell us specifically the website and what we'll find in that scholarly, scientifically conducted report.
[02:42:46.228 --> 02:42:47.249]  Okay, let's see.
[02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:48.709]  If you Google on Jones Thermate,
[02:42:54.065 --> 02:42:57.427]  That'll bring up probably me or maybe you.
[02:42:57.627 --> 02:43:00.489]  The two of us seem to be first.
[02:43:01.009 --> 02:43:02.229]  Let's just see what it is today.
[02:43:02.390 --> 02:43:02.850]  Sure.
[02:43:02.910 --> 02:43:04.891]  That'll bring up my paper immediately.
[02:43:04.931 --> 02:43:07.152]  Just Google on Jones Thermate.
[02:43:07.973 --> 02:43:08.173]  Sure.
[02:43:08.213 --> 02:43:08.853]  It's easy to find.
[02:43:08.873 --> 02:43:11.474]  Just put it in a major search engine and it'll pop up.
[02:43:11.494 --> 02:43:13.115]  It's a long URL there at Brigham Young.
[02:43:13.135 --> 02:43:13.816]  We also have a link to it.
[02:43:13.856 --> 02:43:14.856]  That's the trouble with it.
[02:43:14.876 --> 02:43:17.758]  But yeah, if you just... and Jones, let's see.
[02:43:18.803 --> 02:43:19.423]  You're my giant.
[02:43:19.443 --> 02:43:20.684]  Mine came up first today.
[02:43:20.884 --> 02:43:21.745]  Good, good.
[02:43:22.185 --> 02:43:22.965]  You're number three.
[02:43:26.587 --> 02:43:28.648]  Let's go ahead and take some calls here.
[02:43:28.949 --> 02:43:29.969]  Andy's been holding the longest.
[02:43:29.989 --> 02:43:31.450]  I don't think he's on subject, but that's okay.
[02:43:31.470 --> 02:43:33.391]  Then Jim, Robert, Tony and others are.
[02:43:33.731 --> 02:43:35.092]  Andy in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[02:43:35.112 --> 02:43:35.612]  You're on the air.
[02:43:35.652 --> 02:43:35.993]  Go ahead.
[02:43:37.473 --> 02:43:38.674]  But turn your radio off, Andy.
[02:43:40.935 --> 02:43:41.776]  He's listening to the radio.
[02:43:41.796 --> 02:43:42.276]  Put him on hold.
[02:43:42.936 --> 02:43:44.517]  Jim in Texas, you're on the air, Jim.
[02:43:44.557 --> 02:43:44.937]  Go ahead.
[02:43:46.318 --> 02:43:46.818]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:47.159 --> 02:43:47.339]  Yes.
[02:43:47.847 --> 02:43:50.269]  Hello to Mr. Jones and Professor Jones.
[02:43:50.769 --> 02:43:51.110]  Hi.
[02:43:51.310 --> 02:43:56.394]  Listen, uh, or as the governor of Texas would call you, Jonesy.
[02:43:56.854 --> 02:43:57.455]  Yeah.
[02:43:57.915 --> 02:44:00.958]  But at any rate... Yeah, we had the governor on one day, that's what he said.
[02:44:00.978 --> 02:44:01.358]  Yeah.
[02:44:01.378 --> 02:44:01.799]  Go ahead.
[02:44:01.819 --> 02:44:02.899]  Yeah.
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:10.866]  Uh, the chairman of that 9-11 whitewash omission, you know Alex, was in town recently, uh, in this area.
[02:44:11.687 --> 02:44:13.308]  And, uh... And we went and confronted him.
[02:44:14.669 --> 02:44:15.230]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:15.590 --> 02:44:16.831]  Oh, yeah, I confronted him.
[02:44:17.962 --> 02:44:30.951]  I inquired directly of him, the cover-up artist himself, at point-blank range at a reception following his rationalization of the events on September 11th.
[02:44:31.471 --> 02:44:32.472]  Kevin Smith was there.
[02:44:34.193 --> 02:44:38.355]  First I told him, I said, I wasn't keen on his report and I'm definitely doubting Thomas.
[02:44:39.936 --> 02:44:41.758]  He was too stupid to get that joke.
[02:44:43.118 --> 02:44:44.099]  I asked him, you know,
[02:44:45.802 --> 02:44:47.663]  Very politely, I said, sir, please.
[02:44:48.503 --> 02:44:51.084]  You know, less than a foot from his face.
[02:44:51.744 --> 02:44:53.805]  Because I was, you know... Okay, what did you say?
[02:44:53.825 --> 02:44:54.165]  Tell us.
[02:44:54.685 --> 02:44:56.006]  I said, what happened to Building 7?
[02:44:56.386 --> 02:44:56.926]  What happened?
[02:44:57.347 --> 02:44:58.047]  Uh-huh.
[02:44:58.127 --> 02:45:07.931]  Why didn't the Pentagon, nor the Shanksville Pennsylvania area have any resemblance to a plane crash?
[02:45:08.911 --> 02:45:09.891]  Well, what happened to Building 7?
[02:45:10.112 --> 02:45:13.813]  So he turns his back on me and acts like he's going to sign some books and some autographs.
[02:45:14.232 --> 02:45:21.780]  And of course I shuffle around and get in front of him again and ask the question two or three times, please tell me.
[02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:25.424]  And then he finally says, well, we don't have a problem with Building 7.
[02:45:25.644 --> 02:45:29.147]  And I told him, I do have a problem with Building 7.
[02:45:29.528 --> 02:45:30.689]  Please explain it to me.
[02:45:30.929 --> 02:45:32.431]  How could it possibly have happened?
[02:45:32.876 --> 02:45:36.318]  And then, the thugs move in, and I get escorted away.
[02:45:36.619 --> 02:45:42.923]  Well, whenever Keene was in town, I sent cameras up there, and we confronted him, and it's going to be, I'm told, in the final edition of loose change they're making.
[02:45:43.684 --> 02:45:44.804]  But, thank you.
[02:45:44.824 --> 02:45:46.125]  That's Jim Dillon calling in.
[02:45:46.145 --> 02:45:50.528]  When I mentioned that we confronted him, I didn't know that he'd been here again, and Jim Dillon had.
[02:45:50.548 --> 02:45:51.449]  That's what Jim does.
[02:45:52.210 --> 02:45:53.110]  But, thank you.
[02:45:53.491 --> 02:45:54.351]  Thank you for that.
[02:45:54.851 --> 02:45:57.613]  See, there's an example of what I call a worker bee.
[02:45:58.094 --> 02:45:59.375]  Alex getting out there, and
[02:46:00.498 --> 02:46:03.919]  Confronting these guys and, you know, keeping this movement going.
[02:46:04.159 --> 02:46:06.280]  Well, everywhere they go, they get confronted now.
[02:46:06.700 --> 02:46:06.920]  Sure.
[02:46:07.881 --> 02:46:13.123]  And so that's got to psychologically freak them out to let them know that we know, man, everywhere I go, these people confront me.
[02:46:13.143 --> 02:46:13.603]  That's right.
[02:46:14.053 --> 02:46:19.874]  That'll make them think twice, because we know that commission, like the Warren Commission, is filled with really dirty insiders.
[02:46:20.394 --> 02:46:24.135]  Before we forget that question, I'm going to take a few more calls here, Professor Jones, in the time we've got left.
[02:46:24.495 --> 02:46:27.096]  Briefly, they blew Tower 1 and 2 from the top down.
[02:46:27.136 --> 02:46:27.996]  You've gone through that.
[02:46:28.256 --> 02:46:32.917]  Building 7 is the classic bottom collapse inward in its own footprint demolition.
[02:46:33.137 --> 02:46:34.297]  Can you explain the difference?
[02:46:34.317 --> 02:46:36.598]  There was a caller before you came on who had that question for you.
[02:46:37.298 --> 02:46:37.498]  Sure.
[02:46:38.078 --> 02:46:38.278]  Yeah.
[02:46:38.638 --> 02:46:42.519]  So, clearly, we observe the
[02:46:43.937 --> 02:46:52.084]  Explosions, I mean we observe these beams flying out horizontally, the squibs going out at high velocity horizontally into towers.
[02:46:53.205 --> 02:46:56.528]  And it looks like definitely then the top down.
[02:46:57.769 --> 02:47:09.339]  And whereas with Building 7, when you look at it, because we don't have a lot of photos yet, we're still trying to get NIST to release to us, which we're reluctant to do on Building 7, for sure.
[02:47:10.039 --> 02:47:10.480]  But anyway,
[02:47:11.624 --> 02:47:15.926]  It does appear that there is something dramatic that happened low down.
[02:47:16.006 --> 02:47:21.968]  Somebody pulled, to coin a phrase, the columns down low.
[02:47:23.108 --> 02:47:24.689]  And then we see the building collapse.
[02:47:24.709 --> 02:47:28.050]  That does look like a more conventional classic implosion.
[02:47:28.230 --> 02:47:28.850]  And I've been there.
[02:47:28.890 --> 02:47:30.711]  It was 20 feet away from the U.S.
[02:47:30.731 --> 02:47:32.051]  Post Office in another building.
[02:47:32.071 --> 02:47:35.052]  They blew it so perfectly, almost no damage to those buildings.
[02:47:35.753 --> 02:47:36.993]  It's remarkable how
[02:47:38.094 --> 02:47:40.655]  Symmetrically and rapidly that building fell.
[02:47:40.955 --> 02:47:42.435]  But let me interject something on that.
[02:47:42.815 --> 02:47:52.678]  Building 7, as NIST then contracted another company called ARA to analyze the collapse of WTC 7.
[02:47:54.018 --> 02:48:04.701]  In their award, or solicitation, they said, and this said, and I'm quoting, create detailed floor analyses to determine likely modes of failure for floors 8 to 46.
[02:48:07.236 --> 02:48:09.178]  Due to failure of one or more supporting columns.
[02:48:09.198 --> 02:48:13.223]  In other words, as they award this contract... They're telling them what they want.
[02:48:13.803 --> 02:48:14.043]  Yeah.
[02:48:14.324 --> 02:48:16.346]  We don't want you to look at anything below floor 8.
[02:48:16.626 --> 02:48:17.767]  Well, what does that make me think?
[02:48:18.468 --> 02:48:23.414]  That makes me think, well, the most interesting occurrence is below floor 8.
[02:48:23.474 --> 02:48:25.135]  That's where the explosives were.
[02:48:25.336 --> 02:48:27.578]  That's where you carry out a conventional demolition.
[02:48:27.798 --> 02:48:29.140]  That's exactly right.
[02:48:30.712 --> 02:48:31.613]  Unbelievable.
[02:48:32.153 --> 02:48:36.135]  You can see them blow the penthouse center pillar so it collapses in on itself.
[02:48:36.576 --> 02:48:37.957]  You can see some squibs going.
[02:48:38.457 --> 02:48:42.419]  It fell right at the speed of a bowling ball, speed of gravity.
[02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:43.720]  Come on, folks.
[02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:44.220]  We'll be back.
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:45.161]  Take a few final calls.
[02:48:48.826 --> 02:48:49.286]  It's here!
[02:48:49.506 --> 02:48:54.247]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.647 --> 02:49:02.309]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.989 --> 02:49:10.030]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.431 --> 02:49:17.292]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.802 --> 02:49:21.863]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.163 --> 02:49:25.624]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.124 --> 02:49:28.045]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.385 --> 02:49:32.286]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:46.818 --> 02:50:47.158]  I think so.
[02:51:02.063 --> 02:51:02.703]  We're good to go!
[02:51:31.579 --> 02:51:34.661]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.821 --> 02:51:40.785]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:50.532 --> 02:51:52.453]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.914 --> 02:51:55.716]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

[02:52:27.362 --> 02:52:30.224]  Robert in San Diego, California.
[02:52:30.284 --> 02:52:31.244]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:52:32.045 --> 02:52:33.005]  Alex, really quick.
[02:52:33.065 --> 02:52:39.749]  Terror Storm is a .60 caliber machine gun on full auto, precisely nailing dozens of smoking gun points one after another.
[02:52:40.289 --> 02:52:41.150]  Everybody has to get it.
[02:52:41.170 --> 02:52:43.851]  It's smelling salts for the political zombies out there.
[02:52:44.211 --> 02:52:46.032]  Hey, I ought to have you writing stuff for me.
[02:52:46.052 --> 02:52:46.492]  That's good.
[02:52:47.513 --> 02:52:53.576]  But a quick question for your guest, which is really interesting to me, is Professor Jones, what education level do you need to have to join your team?
[02:52:54.117 --> 02:52:56.538]  And please explain the dynamics in your own family
[02:52:56.943 --> 02:53:00.184]  When you woke up to the facts, did your friends and loved ones stick behind you?
[02:53:00.204 --> 02:53:02.165]  Oh, those are great questions.
[02:53:03.025 --> 02:53:09.087]  Okay, scholarsfor911truth.org is where you go to join us.
[02:53:09.107 --> 02:53:11.088]  You don't have to be a PhD.
[02:53:11.728 --> 02:53:19.331]  We have student members, we have associate members, basically, and then of course we do have PhDs.
[02:53:19.371 --> 02:53:20.591]  Those are your full members.
[02:53:20.671 --> 02:53:23.392]  I'm sorry, we just kind of did that that way, but...
[02:53:24.620 --> 02:53:29.921]  I mean, obviously, the worker bees are equally as important as the PhDs.
[02:53:32.342 --> 02:53:36.902]  You know, that reminds me, Alex, of when I have graduate students.
[02:53:37.443 --> 02:53:38.943]  These guys work really hard.
[02:53:39.303 --> 02:53:41.443]  Well, it's the same way in Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[02:53:41.463 --> 02:53:43.964]  We've got all these people working hard together.
[02:53:43.984 --> 02:53:45.764]  We have our own little forum, too.
[02:53:45.824 --> 02:53:46.544]  It's very active.
[02:53:47.105 --> 02:53:50.385]  So you just go there, st911.org.
[02:53:50.525 --> 02:53:51.565]  We'll get you there, too.
[02:53:52.046 --> 02:53:54.106]  It's a synergy of peer research going on.
[02:53:54.657 --> 02:53:58.699]  It is, and you click on join us, and we have over 400 now.
[02:53:58.760 --> 02:54:07.585]  We could sure use more, of course, and we're just coordinating with other people, you know, the spine and the... We're almost out of time, Professor.
[02:54:07.605 --> 02:54:09.226]  What about the response by family?
[02:54:10.026 --> 02:54:23.094]  Okay, my wife was a little worried for my safety, and basically as we talked about it, I said either I've got to be quiet or I've got to be real vocal.
[02:54:23.570 --> 02:54:26.832]  You know, I think there's safety in one or the other extreme there.
[02:54:27.172 --> 02:54:29.093]  So I went to the vocal side.
[02:54:29.773 --> 02:54:32.194]  I just didn't feel like I could shut up anyway about it.
[02:54:32.874 --> 02:54:33.675]  And that was my wife.
[02:54:34.535 --> 02:54:42.258]  My parents were quite displeased.
[02:54:42.318 --> 02:54:47.441]  I mean, they're gung-ho Republicans from decades, you understand.
[02:54:47.461 --> 02:54:49.982]  So, of course, I was a Republican until
[02:54:50.811 --> 02:54:53.052]  I found out about 9-11 and no longer am.
[02:54:54.113 --> 02:54:55.294]  That's my background.
[02:54:55.334 --> 02:55:04.799]  So yeah, I didn't have and don't have support there, but you know, they're tolerant and... Well, it's hard for people to believe.
[02:55:05.039 --> 02:55:18.347]  I mean, it's hard to believe that Bayer let hundreds of thousands die knowingly with AIDS, HIV, and Hepatitis in their Factor VIII and knowingly sat around and shipped it, you know, killing children and, you know,
[02:55:18.667 --> 02:55:19.668]  Hundreds of times more.
[02:55:19.688 --> 02:55:21.969]  It's conservatively right up at a million worldwide.
[02:55:21.989 --> 02:55:23.130]  So I don't want to hear it anymore.
[02:55:23.150 --> 02:55:26.452]  You know, black men, syphilis, Tuskegee, the atomic soldiers.
[02:55:26.852 --> 02:55:28.173]  People need to stop being naive.
[02:55:28.213 --> 02:55:32.636]  That's what lets... The devil's biggest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[02:55:32.856 --> 02:55:33.776]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[02:55:33.996 --> 02:55:35.938]  I'm sorry to Tony and Andy and everybody else.
[02:55:36.238 --> 02:55:38.039]  Professor Jones, you are so gracious.
[02:55:38.079 --> 02:55:39.940]  I know you're very busy to spend a full hour with us.
[02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:42.942]  And every few months whenever new stuff develops, I'd like to have you on.
[02:55:43.702 --> 02:55:50.967]  I really count you as a great friend and I'm drawn to your kindly, scholarly spirit of you and your wife.
[02:55:51.547 --> 02:55:52.888]  Well, thanks so much, Alex.
[02:55:52.968 --> 02:55:59.753]  We just really appreciate you and love the work you're doing and carry on and I'll contribute wherever I can.
[02:55:59.793 --> 02:56:00.513]  Just give me a call.
[02:56:00.873 --> 02:56:04.716]  Well, Vaya con Dios to you, my friend, and congratulations on that new granddaughter.
[02:56:04.756 --> 02:56:06.097]  You are truly a rich man.
[02:56:06.835 --> 02:56:08.036]  We certainly are blessed.
[02:56:08.296 --> 02:56:08.516]  Thanks.
[02:56:08.856 --> 02:56:09.676]  Take care, my friend.
[02:56:10.177 --> 02:56:12.237]  All right, there goes Professor Stephen Jones.
[02:56:12.277 --> 02:56:16.179]  You can read his detailed, growing analysis paper up on InfoWars.com.
[02:56:16.539 --> 02:56:17.880]  I'll be back tonight, nine to midnight.
[02:56:17.940 --> 02:56:18.980]  Back to Marlowe with the two.
[02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:20.981]  Get out there and expose the murdering terrorist.
[02:56:21.241 --> 02:56:24.783]  God bless you all!
[02:56:25.883 --> 02:56:29.765]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
