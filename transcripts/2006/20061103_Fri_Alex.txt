[00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.370]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:08.112]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:09.953]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:11.394]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.056]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:17.338]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:22.021]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:32.168]  Well, I have the...
[00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:34.998]  Wikipedia bio here.
[00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:38.639]  I also have several other bios, literary bios of Gore Vidal.
[00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.700]  If I tried to cover all of this, it would take several hours.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:52.503]  But he is one of the only living literary legends, right up there with the great folks like Kurt Vonnegut, who is on board with what we do here.
[00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:56.264]  And we are so honored to have Gore Vidal with us.
[00:00:56.864 --> 00:01:00.025]  I spent a lot of time last week and this weekend and showed him my crew.
[00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:01.717]  Well, very happy to be there.
[00:01:01.737 --> 00:01:03.758]  And looking forward to actually being in Austin.
[00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:30.763]  Fairly soon, for the first time.
[00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:31.803]  That's right.
[00:01:31.823 --> 00:01:43.488]  Well, we're on all over the country, but our home base is Austin, and I certainly look forward to coming out and maybe getting a 10-minute interview with you for my local TV show, but tell us why you're going to be in Austin and what your latest work is.
[00:01:44.348 --> 00:01:45.488]  Well, I was invited.
[00:01:45.508 --> 00:01:49.270]  There's some sort of a festival going on, I think.
[00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.410]  Oh, yeah.
[00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:56.933]  In Austin, and I have a new book of essays, of memoirs.
[00:01:59.017 --> 00:02:04.859]  Oh, point-to-point navigation covers the last 4,000 years of my life.
[00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:06.660]  Or maybe it's just 40 years.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.440]  Seems like 4,000.
[00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:13.002]  And I will be chatting about whatever people want to chat about.
[00:02:13.022 --> 00:02:14.042]  And I'm very curious.
[00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:18.584]  There's a wonderful writer that I knew quite well from Austin.
[00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:20.665]  Lived in Austin, anyway.
[00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:21.565]  Bill Grammer.
[00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:23.146]  He still remembered?
[00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:25.026]  Yes, he is.
[00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.087]  He wrote a book called The Gay Place.
[00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:34.876]  Well, in fact, I don't have the printout in front of me, but I'll get it during the break, and it's the big Texas Book Festival.
[00:02:54.865 --> 00:03:00.509]  It's huge, and you're going to be there, so we'll tell folks about that coming up after this break.
[00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.752]  These days, I just want to get a gauge of where you're at, sir.
[00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:08.615]  What are you thinking about most these days, Gore Vidal?
[00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:20.324]  Well, I'm thinking most about the coup d'etat post-9-11, in which we lost the Republic, and I find that disturbing.
[00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:23.026]  So the only way that I could
[00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:50.165]  do something about it I've been stumping all over the state of California for Democratic candidates for Congress and I've gone further afield around the country and pointing out some of the dangers and some of the contradictions of the junta that currently rules us and beginning to feel that a tide is changing
[00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:55.833]  The first twinge of optimism that I've had in some time.
[00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:57.173]  That is what I'm doing.
[00:03:58.253 --> 00:03:58.954]  Well, you're right.
[00:03:58.994 --> 00:03:59.994]  The tide is turning.
[00:04:00.034 --> 00:04:06.735]  The problem is people like Nancy Pelosi are going to try to co-opt it and ensure that revolution doesn't have teeth.
[00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:12.177]  She was on 60 Minutes last night promising she's going to shield George Bush from impeachment.
[00:04:13.717 --> 00:04:15.297]  That's a mistake, of course.
[00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:18.558]  And she can't stop it.
[00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:21.479]  Once it starts, once the
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.200]  The Democrats have organized the House.
[00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:31.362]  Even though she may be the Speaker of the House, she could be overruled.
[00:04:31.382 --> 00:04:34.883]  The Judiciary Committee has got good people on it, like John Conyers.
[00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:42.384]  And if the Senate also goes, then you'll have Ley and really good people on the other side.
[00:04:43.144 --> 00:04:44.085]  Gore Vidal, stay there, sir.
[00:04:44.105 --> 00:04:44.765]  We've got a break.
[00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:45.905]  Long segment coming up.
[00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:47.105]  Plenty of time to talk.
[00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:49.186]  The death of the Republic.
[00:04:49.266 --> 00:04:49.846]  It's happened.
[00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:50.866]  It's on the gurney.
[00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.342]  And we can try to get out the defibrillators and try to shock the heart back into motion.
[00:04:56.802 --> 00:04:57.683]  Will we do that?
[00:04:57.803 --> 00:04:59.044]  We'll be right back with Gore Vidal.
[00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:07.589]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:09.870]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.855]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.615]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:37.442]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.762 --> 00:05:41.245]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.725 --> 00:05:43.646]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:47.829]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:09.209]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.830]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:23.034]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:26.856]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:32.180]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.166]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:40.343]  What about you?
[00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:46.349]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:07:02.102 --> 00:07:04.686]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:07.009]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:17.382]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:20.026]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[00:07:20.186 --> 00:07:24.269]  There's a 100% unconditional guarantee on all their wonderful products.
[00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:31.235]  They're all natural, they're triple concentrated, they're factory direct, factory owned and operated since 1947.

[00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:55.013]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.342 --> 00:08:26.550]  Looking at my call board here, I know we have calls from as far away as Australia, Canada, and we're going to take calls the last 15-20 minutes or so in this interview with Gore Vidal, but specifically it needs to be a question for Gore Vidal.
[00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.472]  Again, we don't screen calls here, but I ask to listen when we have a special guest.
[00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:32.050]  We're good to go.
[00:08:54.028 --> 00:08:54.248]  Yes, we are.
[00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:17.426]  And it's not just Gore Vidal saying that now.
[00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:18.727]  He's been saying that for five years.
[00:09:19.347 --> 00:09:20.448]  Now it's Keith Uberman.
[00:09:20.488 --> 00:09:21.609]  Now it's Lou Dobbs.
[00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:24.471]  Now it's almost every constitutional law scholar.
[00:09:25.052 --> 00:09:30.116]  They're putting into law things that Hitler didn't even get put on paper.
[00:09:30.156 --> 00:09:30.737]  He just did it.
[00:09:31.677 --> 00:09:34.440]  And we're going to be talking to Gore Vidal about that today.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.442]  Gore Vidal, again, thank you so much for joining us, sir.
[00:09:37.762 --> 00:09:43.247]  Speaking about the death of the Republic, from your unique perspective, historically, why do you say the Republic is dead?
[00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:52.538]  Well, you know, I lived through... This is California's finest that you hear.
[00:09:54.439 --> 00:09:56.379]  I lived through most of the 20th century.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:11.564]  I was brought up in Washington, D.C., in my grandfather's house, and he was a blind man, but he put together something called the State of Oklahoma.
[00:10:12.372 --> 00:10:17.573]  And was elected their first senator in 1907 and served till 37.
[00:10:18.794 --> 00:10:23.095]  And the Constitution and our Republic was very much on his mind.
[00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:30.977]  He used to say to me, just as a kid growing up, he knew I was going to be political in some way.
[00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:40.099]  He always said, remember that the only phrase that matters in all of our great public papers is due process of law.
[00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:46.595]  I mean, that was tattooed on my brain, and it's still there.
[00:10:47.896 --> 00:10:55.883]  And when we lost habeas corpus in a recent paper by Mr. Gonzalez and his masters, I thought, wow!
[00:10:57.124 --> 00:11:00.067]  I didn't think I would live so long to see that one go.
[00:11:00.087 --> 00:11:02.329]  Because that's Magna Carta.
[00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:06.432]  That takes us back to the 10th or 11th century.
[00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:07.393]  1215, yeah.
[00:11:08.854 --> 00:11:09.555]  Indeed it does.
[00:11:10.489 --> 00:11:19.274]  Spirit of Runnymede runs no longer in our Republic and a number of things were very disturbing.
[00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:26.458]  One was the two stolen elections of the year 2000-2004.
[00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:37.704]  There's some disagreements on to what extent, who did it and so on, but electronic balloting machinery seems to have been responsible for a great deal of the theft.
[00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:43.450]  That took place, first in Florida in 2000, then in Ohio in 2004.
[00:11:45.551 --> 00:11:52.535]  Now, when I really took alarm, I've always hated the New York Times for many, many good reasons.
[00:11:53.315 --> 00:11:56.037]  Because it covers up so much that it ought to be.
[00:11:56.377 --> 00:12:00.419]  But then poses as if it's, you know, the trusted name.
[00:12:00.439 --> 00:12:01.660]  I would call it fake liberal.
[00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:05.054]  Fake liberal, whatever it is, it's fake.
[00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:09.095]  And the paper of record, I mean, it's no such thing.
[00:12:09.955 --> 00:12:10.515]  Example.
[00:12:11.775 --> 00:12:15.056]  You know, this really was an alarm bell in my head.
[00:12:18.517 --> 00:12:31.040]  Apropos the election of 2004, a first-rate congressman called John Conyers, who is the ranking Democrat of the Judiciary Committee in the House and will be head of the committee should the Democrats come back,
[00:12:32.656 --> 00:12:44.746]  He went up with a pretty big crew of investigators to Ohio to investigate the Secretary of State there, who was up to all sorts of mischief, a man called Blackwell, who's now running for governor.
[00:12:46.147 --> 00:13:01.999]  And there was a lot of work done on who had stolen what election, who had made it impossible for certain minorities to vote by saying that they had the same names as Elon, and so forth, all the usual negative nonsense.
[00:13:03.188 --> 00:13:08.390]  So, Conyers came out with a report on it, which was a small book.
[00:13:10.191 --> 00:13:17.353]  To be helpful, I said I would write a preface to it, get a publisher in Chicago, where it was duly published.
[00:13:18.234 --> 00:13:31.299]  Now, here it is all, there it is right in front of you, who was where when, at what polling booth, and how the vote was reversed, how many Diebold machines were used, how many Sequoia, and so forth.
[00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:36.008]  Then I thought, well, thank God, at last we've got it done.
[00:13:36.028 --> 00:13:37.189]  Now we know.
[00:13:37.809 --> 00:13:39.730]  Otherwise, it's just, you know, hearsay.
[00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:45.554]  And suddenly, I realized, the publisher had sent it off to the New York Times.
[00:13:46.314 --> 00:13:47.635]  They refused to review it.
[00:13:48.732 --> 00:13:53.354]  No, this is from a distinguished member of Congress, from the Judiciary Committee.
[00:13:53.574 --> 00:14:04.859]  And let's be clear, and again we're talking to Gore Vidal, the famous author and researcher, they didn't just review it and try to poke holes in it, which they knew they couldn't, they just refused to review it.
[00:14:05.619 --> 00:14:07.580]  They refused ever to mention it.
[00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:10.342]  As did the Washington Post.
[00:14:11.342 --> 00:14:13.523]  As did, I think, the Wall Street Journal.
[00:14:14.488 --> 00:14:19.109]  The only paper any of us has ever heard of that reviewed it was the Boston Globe.
[00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:42.997]  And I thought, really, if the principal newspapers of the country refuse to take notice of the fact that a presidential election has been twice stolen, and an imposter is pretending to be president, and guiding us straight into wars, which benefit his cronies, and
[00:14:43.636 --> 00:14:43.917]  Thank you.
[00:14:57.967 --> 00:15:05.930]  And what horrifies me most is that there's never any indication of, okay, 90% bad, 10% good is still happening.
[00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:11.571]  It's every signpost as we're going into authoritarian, despotic fascism.
[00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:16.213]  Every signpost screams Stalinistic, Hitlerian, Maoist.
[00:15:16.673 --> 00:15:19.314]  Every signpost shows hyper-tyranny.
[00:15:19.354 --> 00:15:20.594]  Do you agree with that analysis?
[00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:24.655]  Well, it's not an analysis, but it's a statement.
[00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:26.316]  Yes, I do, pretty much.
[00:15:27.995 --> 00:15:38.141]  We have, you said earlier in the program, the things that Hitler never got down to actually writing up as proclamations and so on, but this did anyway.
[00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:55.350]  These people are now trying to give a gloss of legality to Mr. Gonzales, who is, you know, to me, every time I see him, he's a reincarnation of Truman Capote, and he's just only talking about how quaint Geneva Accords are.
[00:15:57.321 --> 00:15:58.982]  They have no idea of cause and effect.
[00:15:59.723 --> 00:16:04.166]  If we don't sign them, this is how you treat your prisoners that you take in a war.
[00:16:05.487 --> 00:16:11.472]  And we reserve the right to put them in terrible prisons, torture them to death sometimes.
[00:16:12.873 --> 00:16:17.977]  It never occurs to these fools that that will be done to American soldiers.
[00:16:18.097 --> 00:16:23.341]  I spent three years in World War II, and many terrible things went on in the Pacific.
[00:16:24.264 --> 00:16:28.469]  Some for which Americans were responsible and some for which Japanese were responsible.
[00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:37.700]  But everybody was trying to hold the fort on legalized torture, which certainly was not on offer.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.244]  It was certainly never certified from the highest levels.
[00:16:42.214 --> 00:16:43.875]  Where do you see it going in the future?
[00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:49.878]  Because Bush is a cornered rat, though he is a titan of a rat.
[00:16:49.898 --> 00:16:54.520]  He's extremely powerful still, but I see him being cornered now.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.180]  We're in a catch-22.
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.542]  If we don't fight these fascists, then they will expand their power.
[00:17:00.802 --> 00:17:06.585]  If we do corner them, then they will still launch us into even bigger crises to try to cover their tracks.
[00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:07.845]  What do you see happening in the future?
[00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:15.255]  Our greatest difficulty at the moment is that the media is totally corrupted.
[00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:21.677]  Starting with the New York Times, the media belongs to our rulers.
[00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:31.580]  So in the old days, when something ghastly would go wrong, you could count on journalists writing about it.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.421]  TV, when TV was invented, radio.
[00:17:35.461 --> 00:17:36.321]  There's nothing there.
[00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:38.682]  There are no voices expressing
[00:17:39.703 --> 00:17:40.344]  Disagreement.
[00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:48.231]  Much less saying, every time you say, I'm wartime president, I'm wartime president, just say, well, you're not a wartime president.
[00:17:48.892 --> 00:17:58.800]  You have to have a country for a war, and you cannot have a war unless declared by Congress, which they will not do, as subservient as they are.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.724]  So, why he isn't shut up on that issue, I don't
[00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:09.513]  What do you see in your crystal ball from your 40 plus years of research and watching politics?
[00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:12.015]  What does Gore Vidal see in the next two years?
[00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:16.358]  I see the bankruptcy of the United States of America.
[00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:18.380]  Follow the money.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:28.848]  The amount of money that they have stiphened off of our treasury for overrun and for mismanagement by Halliburton and friends.
[00:18:30.269 --> 00:18:31.550]  We don't have that much money.
[00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:33.987]  We are getting more and more broke.
[00:18:35.368 --> 00:18:44.097]  I don't know if you noticed that two weeks ago, the Army was asking for a little more money to buy some, I suppose, to buy bullets.
[00:18:45.278 --> 00:18:46.179]  They were running out.
[00:18:47.681 --> 00:18:50.804]  All the money has gone to big companies for high-tech stuff.
[00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:55.219]  Which we don't need for the 22nd century, maybe.
[00:18:55.499 --> 00:19:00.181]  It all goes into white elephants that aren't even for the real war-making capacity.
[00:19:00.501 --> 00:19:05.283]  It's all gone to $15 million blue tarps that Halliburton calls permanent structures.
[00:19:06.483 --> 00:19:07.064]  Indeed, yes.
[00:19:07.224 --> 00:19:12.386]  And what do we need a permanent structure for in Iraq unless we're going to make a colony out of it?
[00:19:13.246 --> 00:19:16.888]  And the Iraqis have already proved that they don't really enjoy our presence.
[00:19:17.262 --> 00:19:23.804]  Well, you hit on something key, uh, integral, and that's that, uh, the last Fed Chairman doubled the money supply in six years.
[00:19:23.864 --> 00:19:26.324]  Bernanke says he's gonna double it in the next two.
[00:19:26.724 --> 00:19:29.165]  I see it spiraling into hyperinflation.
[00:19:30.505 --> 00:19:31.865]  Well, it's already begun.
[00:19:31.885 --> 00:19:35.186]  I just read a story that, uh, in the L.A.
[00:19:35.246 --> 00:19:40.948]  Times, that, um, the $40 entree is now here for restaurants.
[00:19:42.008 --> 00:19:46.709]  Well, people who go to first-rate restaurants know they're gonna pay a lot of money, but
[00:19:47.529 --> 00:19:51.452]  These were for what they thought of as run-of-the-mill, ordinary restaurants.
[00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:52.974]  Gore Vidal, stay there.
[00:19:53.034 --> 00:19:53.454]  Quick break.
[00:19:53.474 --> 00:19:54.595]  We'll come right back to you.
[00:19:54.615 --> 00:19:59.479]  And we'll get into several central issues to how they've gotten this police state.
[00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:01.661]  Gold.
[00:20:01.982 --> 00:20:03.283]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:03.543 --> 00:20:09.608]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:13.631]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:13.991 --> 00:20:15.873]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:15.933 --> 00:20:18.215]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:18.355 --> 00:20:25.060]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.981]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.177 --> 00:20:46.839]  As good as gold, call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:49.780]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:56.103]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[00:21:01.324 --> 00:21:03.865]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:08.847]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:15.609]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:16.670]  We're good to go.
[00:21:33.164 --> 00:21:36.725]  Five, one, six, eight, seven, three, six.

[00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:02.773]  Good morning, honey.
[00:22:03.133 --> 00:22:09.119]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:22:09.419 --> 00:22:10.019]  Yeah.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.821]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:22:12.181 --> 00:22:15.584]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:17.546]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:22:17.986 --> 00:22:19.708]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:21.870]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.911]  Honey, cheer up.
[00:22:23.331 --> 00:22:25.593]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:22:25.834 --> 00:22:26.154]  What?
[00:22:26.594 --> 00:22:37.084]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:22:37.364 --> 00:22:39.546]  You know, this is a terrific cabin!

[00:23:03.743 --> 00:23:05.684]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:08.566]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:09.375 --> 00:23:17.799]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:34.939]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, blasting out worldwide on the M&M dial, shortwave, satellite, and InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:42.906]  Gore Vidal, I mean, again, his bio is so lengthy and everything he's been involved in, the things he's witnessed, the books he's written, the awards he's gotten,
[00:24:43.966 --> 00:24:48.950]  Just, if you don't know who Gore Vidal is, or only heard the name in passing, go to Infowars.com, read his bio.
[00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:56.236]  Right now, I don't want to burn our time up doing that though, so spend some time and check out the new book he's got out as well.
[00:24:56.696 --> 00:25:02.501]  Gore Vidal, Foundations, you know, Hitler used crises he created as a pretext to gain control.
[00:25:03.041 --> 00:25:08.626]  We know that the Roman Emperors loved to do this, problem-reaction solution, the Hegelian dialectic
[00:25:09.344 --> 00:25:11.006]  We know that there is false flag terror.
[00:25:11.066 --> 00:25:14.629]  Our government admits it staged terror attacks in 1953 to overthrow Iran.
[00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.593]  They claimed our ships were attacked to expand the Vietnam War in 1964.
[00:25:18.914 --> 00:25:20.495]  That's now been totally declassified.
[00:25:20.935 --> 00:25:23.078]  There are countless examples of this.
[00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:25.400]  9-11, and I've got a lot of the
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.080]  I'm bugging back.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:26.220]  Okay.
[00:25:54.966 --> 00:26:01.430]  Uh, 9-11 was, uh, first of all, I don't go along with those people who think that the Bushites did it.
[00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:11.736]  And, demonstrably, they didn't, because 9-11 was a brilliantly executed act of terrorism, and they are not capable of anything brilliant.
[00:26:12.717 --> 00:26:13.837]  So they couldn't have done it.
[00:26:14.898 --> 00:26:17.279]  But, they were ready to take advantage of it.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.903]  And all the information that was coming in, Putin in Russia warned us.
[00:26:23.547 --> 00:26:25.489]  Mubarak, in Egypt, warned us.
[00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.171]  Assad warned us.
[00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:35.097]  All kinds of people were warning us that we were going to have unpleasant visitors to our skies.
[00:26:36.418 --> 00:26:37.599]  Did they pay any attention?
[00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:38.520]  No, they did not.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.042]  They now pretend, oh, we didn't know about it.
[00:26:41.102 --> 00:26:42.283]  Oh, we didn't know.
[00:26:42.903 --> 00:26:44.144]  Oh, well, that wasn't accurate.
[00:26:45.285 --> 00:26:51.831]  Well, they'll go on dithering, but they knew something was going to happen, and they were ready.
[00:26:52.952 --> 00:26:57.336]  Which means that they knew it would be expensive, whatever it was.
[00:26:58.016 --> 00:27:01.439]  Did they know that buildings in New York were going to be blown up?
[00:27:01.539 --> 00:27:03.080]  No, I don't suppose they did.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:11.467]  Well, Mr. Vidal, let me get down to brass taxes, and I'll dig through here and get some of the quotes that you've reportedly said, and I'm going to actually listen to some of these interviews.
[00:27:12.325 --> 00:27:17.889]  You bring up the fact that the head of Pakistani intelligence wired $100,000 as a supposed lead hijacker.
[00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:22.953]  Well, Pakistan's known to be basically an MI6-CIA front.
[00:27:23.373 --> 00:27:24.714]  You talk about how we had U.S.
[00:27:24.734 --> 00:27:27.957]  troops mass there around Afghanistan in the months before.
[00:27:28.017 --> 00:27:30.419]  Bush had a launch order on his desk to attack.
[00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:32.901]  I mean, how do they have all that specifically ready?
[00:27:32.961 --> 00:27:40.926]  I mean, in the quotes I've seen here from you, it looks like you're pointing towards, I mean, I guess, let it happen on purpose instead of made it happen on purpose?
[00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:41.547]  Or what are you saying?
[00:27:41.927 --> 00:27:43.729]  I think let it happen on purpose.
[00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.651]  There is no proof of this.
[00:27:48.092 --> 00:27:51.615]  There are moments when you go by opinions, and moments when you go by the facts.
[00:27:52.796 --> 00:28:09.550]  It is quite true that the head of the Pakistani Secret Service, he was in Washington meeting with Mr. Tenet, whatever his name was, the head of the CIA, at an ordinary bureaucratic meeting.
[00:28:10.646 --> 00:28:20.050]  And while they were there, suddenly the head of the IS something or other, they call it, the Pakistani... Mahmood Ahmad ISI.
[00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.870]  That's it.
[00:28:24.212 --> 00:28:40.278]  He cables one of his people in Islamabad, where their headquarters is, to send a hundred thousand dollars, wire it, to Mohammed Atta, who is somewhere in the Midwest, and who is the principal, who is the chief,
[00:28:41.036 --> 00:28:45.360]  of the gang that bombed New York, the Pentagon and so on.
[00:28:46.821 --> 00:28:48.503]  That has never been followed up on.
[00:28:48.603 --> 00:29:02.596]  I found that in the Times of India, generally a pretty reliable paper, the Wall Street Journal even repeated the story about the time right after 9-11 saying that a warning had come.
[00:29:03.186 --> 00:29:05.708]  And the 9-11 Commission said they're not interested in the money.
[00:29:06.068 --> 00:29:17.657]  But I mean, how could he, the week before the attacks, wire this money when he's meeting at the White House, he's meeting at the House and Senate's Intelligence Committee Chairman on the morning of 9-11, meeting with Goss and Senator Graham, Bob Graham of Florida.
[00:29:18.118 --> 00:29:23.342]  They're all meeting there, and there's this $100,000 payment, you know, right before this happens.
[00:29:23.402 --> 00:29:24.743]  Quick break, we're going to come back and talk.
[00:29:25.343 --> 00:29:29.065]  More about this with our guest, Gore Vidal.
[00:29:29.085 --> 00:29:30.085]  Sorry about all these breaks, sir.
[00:29:30.105 --> 00:29:31.085]  This is the last big one.
[00:29:31.766 --> 00:29:34.747]  About a 15-minute segment coming up right after this.
[00:29:35.407 --> 00:29:40.229]  With our guest, we'll get into several other issues with Gore Vidal, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:51.494 --> 00:29:52.394]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.894 --> 00:29:54.375]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:58.175]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.317 --> 00:30:09.843]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:30:10.063 --> 00:30:11.884]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:30:12.084 --> 00:30:13.245]  That's one in four adults.
[00:30:13.598 --> 00:30:19.702]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[00:30:19.962 --> 00:30:23.645]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:07.050]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.476]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:31:11.917 --> 00:31:12.738]  So what do you do?
[00:31:13.058 --> 00:31:17.625]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:31:18.103 --> 00:31:20.225]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:32:04.683 --> 00:32:07.986]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:32:08.366 --> 00:32:11.308]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:32:11.589 --> 00:32:17.953]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:32:18.034 --> 00:32:22.437]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:32:22.677 --> 00:32:27.039]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:32:27.199 --> 00:32:29.800]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.581]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:32:33.061 --> 00:32:35.582]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:32:35.642 --> 00:32:39.884]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:32:39.944 --> 00:32:40.784]  Treasury bonds.
[00:32:41.064 --> 00:32:45.688]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.

[00:33:23.206 --> 00:33:24.686]  Gore Vidal is our guest.
[00:33:24.706 --> 00:33:26.507]  Check out his incredible bio.
[00:33:27.147 --> 00:33:28.988]  Literary legend joining us right now.
[00:33:29.028 --> 00:33:30.048]  A great historian.
[00:33:31.688 --> 00:33:33.609]  And Mr. Vidal, I've got to be honest with you.
[00:33:33.689 --> 00:33:40.291]  Going from the transcripts of what I've read of what you've said on other radio shows and in print interviews and even overseas,
[00:33:41.447 --> 00:33:46.030]  You have, what you basically said earlier, let it happen on purpose.
[00:33:46.471 --> 00:33:52.615]  Then I look at Al-Qaeda, the fact that Brzezinski brags that in 1979 he founded it.
[00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:54.756]  They used him to attack the Serbs in 1999.
[00:33:55.156 --> 00:33:57.598]  Senate report, Alfonso Amado chairman.
[00:33:58.438 --> 00:34:00.720]  We know that these groups get financed.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.761]  We know they build up these enemies.
[00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:09.204]  When you look at the fact that they're abolishing the Bill of Rights, it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:34:09.644 --> 00:34:11.826]  When we look at the fact that they're setting up this police state.
[00:34:11.866 --> 00:34:13.326]  Bush has said it's a hundred year war.
[00:34:13.646 --> 00:34:15.647]  Cheney said it's going to last two generations.
[00:34:16.168 --> 00:34:17.809]  I guess that's the conservative estimate.
[00:34:18.809 --> 00:34:26.073]  I mean, so you think that they're so inept though that they would just let it happen instead of make it happen?
[00:34:27.333 --> 00:34:30.135]  I think they certainly took advantage of it.
[00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:30.875]  They were ready.
[00:34:31.914 --> 00:34:46.204]  And if you remember, at the time of Timothy McVeigh and what happened in Oklahoma City, immediately the Justice Department came up with a very draconian set of laws for us to live by.
[00:34:46.224 --> 00:34:47.465]  The Omnibus Crime Bill.
[00:34:48.185 --> 00:34:49.787]  Yes, the Omnibus Crime Bill.
[00:34:50.807 --> 00:34:53.449]  And that was, alas, on Clinton's watch.
[00:34:54.390 --> 00:35:01.115]  They never got a chance to put it through because the McVeigh thing didn't turn into a great national
[00:35:02.965 --> 00:35:03.805]  Uh, revulsion.
[00:35:04.786 --> 00:35:12.148]  And you corresponded, you corresponded more than anyone else, uh, in the press, according to the press reports I've seen, or is that accurate, with McVeigh?
[00:35:12.628 --> 00:35:13.169]  Yes, I did.
[00:35:14.249 --> 00:35:31.495]  And he was somebody deeply concerned, I'm not saying that I approve of what he did, blowing up a building, and killing a lot of innocent people, but simultaneously, he was a hero in the Gulf War, he got the Bronze Star, Army was eager to get him back in,
[00:35:32.614 --> 00:35:34.915]  And he's somebody who cared about the Constitution.
[00:35:34.955 --> 00:35:37.276]  He was a rather learned young man.
[00:35:38.037 --> 00:35:42.199]  And he wrote a number of pieces that were printed in newspapers at the time of his arrest.
[00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:50.863]  There was a conspiracy back at him, and he was not going to sell out his fellow conspirators.
[00:35:51.944 --> 00:35:57.607]  So suddenly he's condemned to death, and he decides... He wrote this to me.
[00:35:58.307 --> 00:36:00.468]  He said, I have a choice now.
[00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:01.449]  He said, between
[00:36:03.041 --> 00:36:03.461]  Talking.
[00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:09.045]  Or, uh, spending my life in a cement box.
[00:36:10.426 --> 00:36:14.288]  Or, best of all, federally assisted suicide.
[00:36:15.209 --> 00:36:16.870]  And he said, I'm taking suicide.
[00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.332]  Did you ever talk to Jolion West, his doctor?
[00:36:20.352 --> 00:36:20.553]  No.
[00:36:20.613 --> 00:36:21.153]  What'd he say?
[00:36:22.194 --> 00:36:26.376]  Oh, just Jolion West was one of the psychiatrists assigned to McVeigh.
[00:36:26.396 --> 00:36:31.720]  Well, I've read his report on McVeigh, which is, you know, he's perfectly sane and very intelligent.
[00:36:32.652 --> 00:36:34.993]  Gore Vidal, let me ask you a question here.
[00:36:36.834 --> 00:36:40.516]  Corresponding with McVeigh, now he was videotaped.
[00:36:40.536 --> 00:36:41.816]  The FBI admits they've seen the tapes.
[00:36:41.876 --> 00:36:43.157]  I've talked to police that have seen it.
[00:36:43.637 --> 00:36:44.878]  What about John Doe No.
[00:36:44.898 --> 00:36:44.878]  2?
[00:36:44.918 --> 00:36:47.499]  Have you ever seen anything about that Iraqi gentleman?
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.880]  No, I've read about him.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.982]  He keeps popping up, you know, in all the material on this event.
[00:36:55.203 --> 00:36:57.604]  And there were a couple of other Iraqis in town.
[00:36:58.855 --> 00:37:02.097]  Oklahoma City is seeming a strange place for them to foregather.
[00:37:02.217 --> 00:37:05.979]  Yeah, they got taken into custody later, and they were ordered to be released by the Justice Department.
[00:37:05.999 --> 00:37:06.639]  Were you aware of that?
[00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:06.699]  No.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.701]  I wonder why that would happen?
[00:37:10.381 --> 00:37:27.090]  Well, it was, uh... It certainly was a good rehearsal for what was coming, and my point I was about to make was that, uh, once this, uh, omnibus crime thing existed in the Justice Department, now we have
[00:37:27.634 --> 00:37:31.496]  A new Attorney General and so on.
[00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:32.937]  It was put into effect.
[00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:34.057]  It is the U.S.A.
[00:37:34.097 --> 00:37:34.718]  Patriot Act.
[00:37:36.038 --> 00:37:45.283]  It is the child of Clinton's immediate hysterical, I think, response to what had happened in Oklahoma City.
[00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:46.304]  And if H.R.
[00:37:46.324 --> 00:37:50.526]  3162 is the son of the omnibus crime bill, what is H.R.
[00:37:50.546 --> 00:37:52.587]  6133, the Military Commissions Act?
[00:37:57.372 --> 00:37:58.813]  That's the invasion of Poland.
[00:38:00.734 --> 00:38:01.794]  Oh, I agree with you there.
[00:38:01.854 --> 00:38:04.416]  In fact, that's how my new film, Terror Storm, opens, is with Hitler.
[00:38:04.996 --> 00:38:10.159]  You know, Hitler staged that attack on his own military base outside Glywoods to kick off the war.
[00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:12.960]  That's now conclusively admitted to from the Nazi documents.
[00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:17.083]  I mean, if Hitler could stage attacks on himself, why couldn't George Bush?
[00:38:17.103 --> 00:38:21.205]  Because he had to finish breeding my pet goat.
[00:38:23.681 --> 00:38:26.263]  This is very difficult for him to read.
[00:38:26.503 --> 00:38:38.010]  Well, you know, folks say that George Bush can't fight his way out of a paper bag, and that Rove and his handlers are buffoons, but I read an Israeli plan from 1983, and I read a 2002 Pentagon plan, which I can send to you if you haven't seen them.
[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:43.854]  I know you're very informed yourself, where they said they wanted to break the country in three parts, have it in a sectarian war.
[00:38:44.314 --> 00:38:45.996]  Now, I think they were planning to cook a turkey.
[00:38:46.036 --> 00:38:47.997]  They may have overcooked it, where it's imploding.
[00:38:48.377 --> 00:38:49.518]  Oh yeah, but I don't think the brain is his.
[00:38:49.558 --> 00:38:50.199]  I think it's Karl Rove.
[00:38:50.279 --> 00:38:52.081]  I listened to him yesterday on television.
[00:38:52.101 --> 00:38:53.001]  He's up in Buffalo, I think.
[00:39:12.958 --> 00:39:16.319]  It's very, very clever and very mischievous.
[00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:18.960]  I mean, this is a thoroughly bad man.
[00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:21.461]  And quite interesting.
[00:39:21.501 --> 00:39:25.743]  He was exciting the fears of everybody in the audience about everything.
[00:39:26.803 --> 00:39:29.904]  They've got a mantra now, which is totally incredible.
[00:39:30.944 --> 00:39:34.266]  If we don't fight them over there, we'll have to fight them over here.
[00:39:35.406 --> 00:39:37.367]  Well, how the hell are they going to get here?
[00:39:37.487 --> 00:39:38.367]  And to what end?
[00:39:39.494 --> 00:39:48.517]  I mean, these are questions that you could shut these people up if there was an immediate attack, or if there was a Congress which was capable of oversight.
[00:39:48.717 --> 00:39:59.081]  Well, the Army's own report in the National Intelligence Assessment, unanimously, if you believe in the real terrorism paradigm, shows that this has increased the threat of terrorism two-fold.
[00:40:00.282 --> 00:40:01.762]  I should think even more than that.
[00:40:01.782 --> 00:40:06.964]  I mean, we've turned... There are one billion Muslims on Earth, and there are 300 billion of us.
[00:40:07.845 --> 00:40:08.845]  We are outnumbered.
[00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:11.602]  And the money is also on their side, too.
[00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:12.883]  We don't have it anymore.
[00:40:13.583 --> 00:40:29.091]  But, sir, Gore Vidal, that's the neocon plan, is to P-2-O-G, the Pentagon Plan 2003, to, quote, stir up and elicit terror attacks, again creating the tension as a pretext to widen the war.
[00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:32.212]  Well, I don't disagree with that.
[00:40:32.712 --> 00:40:37.875]  I have no evidence of it, but it's certainly... That is what is happening, let us put it this way.
[00:40:38.735 --> 00:40:42.617]  So if it is happening, it must have a parent of some kind.
[00:40:42.897 --> 00:40:43.438]  Well, I agree.
[00:40:43.478 --> 00:40:44.398]  Back to 9-11, sir.
[00:40:44.418 --> 00:40:46.279]  Again, you're gracious to join us in a moment.
[00:40:46.479 --> 00:40:49.041]  In fact, I'll just do that right now.
[00:40:49.941 --> 00:40:54.784]  Coming up is going to be the Texas Book Festival.
[00:40:55.284 --> 00:40:57.986]  We have a link to this up on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:58.006 --> 00:41:03.989]  Gore Vidal is the top featured speaker after Barack Obama.
[00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:12.172]  Obama, The Audacity of Hope, and Gore Vidal will be the featured author of the literary gala at the 2006 festival.
[00:41:12.212 --> 00:41:17.714]  He will be in conversation with Maureen Dowd on Sunday, October 29th from 2 to 3 p.m.
[00:41:17.754 --> 00:41:19.914]  at the Paramount Theater, free to the public.
[00:41:20.335 --> 00:41:27.357]  Texas Monthly editor Evan Smith will also moderate, and I hope to get 10 minutes with Mr. Vidal for the local television show.
[00:41:27.457 --> 00:41:29.157]  It would be gracious of him to do that.
[00:41:29.777 --> 00:41:31.438]  I respect your research of history.
[00:41:31.558 --> 00:41:32.138]  I respect
[00:41:33.266 --> 00:41:38.348]  What you're saying, I mean, you're spot on about the tyranny, you were spot on day one about 9-11.
[00:41:38.948 --> 00:41:39.888]  Let me bring you back to this.
[00:41:39.908 --> 00:41:42.949]  Do you remember a few weeks after 9-11 you were on CNN?
[00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:44.670]  I guess it was a few months.
[00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.492]  I tried to find the clip, but I saw it, one of my staff saw it, one of my crew witnessed it.
[00:41:49.972 --> 00:41:52.273]  And you're on there and you said, I just want to thank CNN.
[00:41:52.293 --> 00:41:59.355]  This has been the first time in months I've been allowed to go on a TV show without military intelligence stomping around in the background.
[00:41:59.695 --> 00:42:02.056]  Was that a joke, tongue-in-cheek, or did that really happen?
[00:42:02.955 --> 00:42:03.675]  That really happens.
[00:42:04.396 --> 00:42:05.136]  Happens quite often.
[00:42:05.877 --> 00:42:07.057]  Oh, please, tell us about it, sir.
[00:42:07.217 --> 00:42:10.059]  Well, I was on with... What is that guy?
[00:42:10.879 --> 00:42:11.940]  Charles something.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.401]  He's got a morning show on CBS.
[00:42:15.742 --> 00:42:16.002]  Yes.
[00:42:16.022 --> 00:42:16.082]  Huh?
[00:42:17.423 --> 00:42:17.683]  Yes.
[00:42:19.264 --> 00:42:21.885]  I have blanked out his name.
[00:42:21.945 --> 00:42:22.345]  Well, it's fine.
[00:42:22.365 --> 00:42:23.206]  It'll pop in your head in a minute.
[00:42:23.226 --> 00:42:24.387]  You were on CBS morning show.
[00:42:24.407 --> 00:42:24.747]  Go ahead.
[00:42:25.247 --> 00:42:25.527]  Yeah.
[00:42:26.748 --> 00:42:32.491]  And it was at the time of Timothy McVeigh's event in Oklahoma City.
[00:42:33.590 --> 00:43:00.387]  And I was in Italy, and they'd sent a crew over, a crew came down from London, for TV, to be on the morning show, and so on, and Mr. Gibson, I think he's called, Charles something, and I start to go into the background of why Timothy McVeigh did what he did, and he had declared war on the federal government, because of what had happened at Waco, and they had
[00:43:01.454 --> 00:43:09.036]  Gone out of their way to destroy a bunch of religious nuts who were all living in a compound with Mr. Koresh.
[00:43:09.056 --> 00:43:11.257]  They killed men, women, and children.
[00:43:11.417 --> 00:43:13.318]  And they could have grabbed him any day, jogged him to town.
[00:43:13.638 --> 00:43:14.398]  Oh, they could have done it.
[00:43:14.678 --> 00:43:15.418]  So many things.
[00:43:15.598 --> 00:43:19.179]  And also, they did the totally illegal.
[00:43:19.219 --> 00:43:20.180]  They used the U.S.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:25.221]  Army and its weaponry to incinerate these innocent people.
[00:43:26.222 --> 00:43:27.382]  And that's, you know,
[00:43:28.123 --> 00:43:38.045]  The Posse Comitatus Act of 1875 says you may not use the American Army against American people, no matter how much order you think you should be keeping.
[00:43:38.845 --> 00:43:40.426]  And they did that, which broke the law.
[00:43:41.306 --> 00:43:51.428]  McVeigh, who was momentarily out of the Army, where he had been much decorated in the Gulf War, became absolutely furious.
[00:43:52.148 --> 00:43:55.709]  He saw that everything he cared about, he knew about the Constitution,
[00:43:57.478 --> 00:44:00.660]  This was not just another dumb kid with a pianist on him.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.240]  He was a very bright man.
[00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:05.382]  And suddenly, he just went ape.
[00:44:06.283 --> 00:44:10.044]  And he said, OK, if you're going to do that to these innocent people, he didn't know any of them.
[00:44:10.685 --> 00:44:16.448]  But out of a sense of justice, which few Americans have, he decided, OK, I'll get back at them.
[00:44:17.848 --> 00:44:19.309]  And I'll blow up the federal building.
[00:44:19.389 --> 00:44:21.770]  But you're on this TV show, you're saying this, what happens?
[00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.911]  I'm saying this, but I'm giving you what I'm saying.
[00:44:24.652 --> 00:44:25.792]  Now, in the middle of saying it,
[00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:32.053]  The sound man, a guy from England, said they'd pull the plug on you.
[00:44:33.413 --> 00:44:36.714]  I said, no, something's gone wrong with the machinery or something.
[00:44:37.434 --> 00:44:42.576]  He said, no, and I've been talking, Mr. Gibson was trying, had contradicted me about Waco.
[00:44:43.376 --> 00:44:45.617]  The government had done nothing wrong at Waco.
[00:44:46.377 --> 00:44:47.838]  Well, everybody knew that they had.
[00:44:49.038 --> 00:44:50.719]  And I said, well, everybody knows.
[00:44:51.859 --> 00:44:53.200]  You can find out about it here.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.340]  You can find out about it there.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.401]  In the middle of that,
[00:44:57.116 --> 00:45:01.078]  The sound, the audio was unplugged and I'm talking into air.
[00:45:02.779 --> 00:45:04.720]  Now I know how these things are done.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.941]  I've been on television for 50 years now.
[00:45:08.302 --> 00:45:11.263]  I know how programs work and I also know how censorship works.
[00:45:11.716 --> 00:45:15.079]  And if they were going to just get rid of you, they'd say, thank you, we're out of time, we're going to commercial.
[00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:21.123]  You said military intelligence, and now we know that major media does have spooks in it.
[00:45:21.503 --> 00:45:24.226]  Now CENTCOM admits they're planting fake news stories.
[00:45:25.146 --> 00:45:30.030]  Bush has spent $1.6 billion the last two years on illegal fake news, buying reporters.
[00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:32.812]  Specifically though, what do you know about the cases you've dealt with?
[00:45:34.613 --> 00:45:39.177]  I can't point a finger at who the spook was, or from what department he came.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:57.047]  I know that voices that they don't want to hear, instead of saying, as you suggest, you know, or using my favorite word on CNN, briefly, says Wolf, uh, Mr. Vidal, what is the meaning of life?
[00:45:57.107 --> 00:45:58.808]  Oh, I'm sorry, we're out of time.
[00:45:59.028 --> 00:46:01.389]  Well, we'll get back to that.
[00:46:01.469 --> 00:46:02.389]  Which they do on purpose.
[00:46:02.409 --> 00:46:04.570]  You can see somebody come on for 30 seconds, a minute.
[00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:05.290]  This happened to me.
[00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.231]  You said the wrong thing.
[00:46:06.311 --> 00:46:06.651]  Boom!
[00:46:07.271 --> 00:46:09.652]  Okay, now we're going to this film clip of something else.
[00:46:10.447 --> 00:46:13.170]  And they hit the ejection button.
[00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.931]  Oh yeah.
[00:46:15.892 --> 00:46:18.995]  We are heavily censored, let us put it simply in one sentence.
[00:46:19.295 --> 00:46:32.968]  But how is the elite, you talk about our overlords, how are they going to deal with the fact that alternative websites telling the truth can pop up and be bigger than the Dallas Morning News website in a matter of months?
[00:46:33.675 --> 00:46:38.557]  Yes, folks, it took us eight years to get bigger than the Dallas Morning News at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:46:38.977 --> 00:46:44.220]  Now, 25-year-olds can start a website in three months, beat us, because they've got what people want to hear.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.381]  How is the establishment going to deal with that?
[00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:48.862]  They'll find a way of wrecking it.
[00:46:50.042 --> 00:46:52.704]  I don't know what the FCC is up to at the moment.
[00:46:53.224 --> 00:46:54.024]  Well, you're right, sir.
[00:46:54.264 --> 00:46:54.945]  That's what they're saying.
[00:46:54.965 --> 00:46:55.705]  That's what they're now doing.
[00:46:55.725 --> 00:46:57.786]  They're saying they're going to tax it, regulate it, shut it down.
[00:46:58.146 --> 00:46:58.826]  Yes, of course.
[00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:02.348]  They cannot have free speech in the United States.
[00:47:03.075 --> 00:47:09.920]  Because free speech, ultimately, will define them, name them, and describe their crime.
[00:47:11.201 --> 00:47:18.667]  And the decent opinion of mankind, as Thomas Jefferson would put it, will go into effect.
[00:47:19.667 --> 00:47:21.589]  I am enough of an optimist to think that's true.
[00:47:22.461 --> 00:47:24.422]  What about government-sponsored terror itself?
[00:47:24.462 --> 00:47:25.343]  You're a historian.
[00:47:25.703 --> 00:47:32.466]  I mean, I would imagine you certainly agree that governments do stage terror attacks against themselves to mobilize their population.
[00:47:32.486 --> 00:47:35.128]  You know, waving the bloody shirt or agent provocateur.
[00:47:35.188 --> 00:47:36.789]  There's different ways of doing it.
[00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:41.151]  Can you comment on government-sponsored terror itself?
[00:47:42.031 --> 00:47:48.575]  Well, we know quite a bit about it, thanks to Herman Goering, who did all that sort of thing for Hitler.
[00:47:49.941 --> 00:47:54.123]  And at Nuremberg, he was being interviewed by a rather bright journalist.
[00:47:55.104 --> 00:47:57.125]  They just got down and started to really chat.
[00:47:58.926 --> 00:48:05.309]  The journalist said, how on earth this most civilized country in Europe was Germany before the Nazis took over?
[00:48:06.229 --> 00:48:12.552]  How could you get those people to fight these terrible wars, do terrible things in concentration camps?
[00:48:13.733 --> 00:48:15.674]  Goering said, well, it's very easy.
[00:48:16.604 --> 00:48:23.250]  Obviously, no sane man is going to join an army and get himself killed, even for loot.
[00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.431]  People are not like that.
[00:48:26.512 --> 00:48:38.381]  But he said, if you frighten them sufficiently, the Red Bolsheviks are coming, the Russian hordes are coming, they're going to sweep the Germans into the sea, they're going to destroy it.
[00:48:39.042 --> 00:48:40.423]  Unless we fight them now.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.641]  Well, if we don't fight them over there, we have to fight them over here.
[00:48:45.661 --> 00:48:51.042]  Even that mantra has been learned by the little man in the White House.
[00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:54.162]  So, Goering put it very neatly.
[00:48:54.322 --> 00:48:55.643]  You frighten people.
[00:48:56.363 --> 00:48:57.423]  The fright keeps going.
[00:48:58.103 --> 00:49:03.404]  We'll see before the election on the coming Tuesday.
[00:49:04.845 --> 00:49:09.646]  We'll suddenly see that we've gone from orange to red.
[00:49:09.666 --> 00:49:11.586]  We're in terrible danger.
[00:49:12.245 --> 00:49:16.968]  All sorts of things are up there in the sky, and they're going to take out every American city.
[00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:21.772]  And Albania has now developed hydrogen weapons.
[00:49:23.073 --> 00:49:28.397]  The lies just go on and on, and there are no truth squads.
[00:49:28.677 --> 00:49:33.961]  Programs like this, stuff on the internet, can squeak through.
[00:49:35.022 --> 00:49:41.066]  But the press itself is absolutely captive, because they're owned.
[00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.612]  I mean, not the press, but television, I mean everything.
[00:49:44.332 --> 00:49:45.313]  All information.
[00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:48.996]  50 years ago you had over 200 companies, now there's 5 and they're all merging.
[00:49:50.397 --> 00:49:50.977]  Indeed, yes.
[00:49:51.218 --> 00:49:53.219]  I mean, it's locked up.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.421]  And money did it all.
[00:49:56.482 --> 00:49:59.304]  Now, how did these individuals get so much money?
[00:50:00.165 --> 00:50:04.949]  Well, they are tithed by, let's say, the Republican Party.
[00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.211]  Okay, we gave you a huge tax break, so we saved
[00:50:10.191 --> 00:50:12.932]  Jones, uh, twenty million dollars a year for you.
[00:50:12.952 --> 00:50:16.693]  So, we need a million or two for the coming election.
[00:50:17.833 --> 00:50:19.753]  Mr. Jones coughs up.
[00:50:20.473 --> 00:50:29.456]  So instead of paying taxes, which would benefit everybody in the country, uh, he only gives the money to the Republican Party so they can keep on playing the game.
[00:50:29.956 --> 00:50:38.978]  Would you put it past Bush or his controllers to stage a terror attack as a way of smokescreening all their scandals?
[00:50:41.295 --> 00:50:45.058]  Well, how desperate will they be before they do that?
[00:50:46.239 --> 00:50:47.840]  Secondly, could they do that?
[00:50:48.961 --> 00:50:53.284]  What Bush has done, I don't think he understands yet what he's done.
[00:50:53.564 --> 00:50:54.025]  Well, stay there.
[00:50:54.045 --> 00:50:56.927]  Let's get the final answer on the other side with Gore Vidal.
[00:50:57.207 --> 00:50:58.568]  We'll also take a few phone calls.
[00:50:59.028 --> 00:50:59.589]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:04.969]  It's here!
[00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:09.933]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:17.999]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:25.724]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.124 --> 00:51:33.009]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[00:51:33.502 --> 00:51:37.524]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.844 --> 00:51:41.486]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.826 --> 00:51:43.727]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:48.009]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.047 --> 00:52:09.312]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.572 --> 00:52:13.914]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.215 --> 00:52:23.140]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:26.942]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.242 --> 00:52:32.268]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.568 --> 00:52:39.316]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.796 --> 00:52:40.337]  What about you?
[00:52:41.073 --> 00:52:46.436]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:00.868 --> 00:53:08.811]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:53:09.271 --> 00:53:12.432]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:54:01.474 --> 00:54:04.036]  Jeremy has never been in studio
[00:54:13.158 --> 00:54:19.481]  Before he works here at the office, but he said he saw Gore Vidal on CNN years ago, right after 9-11, days after, really.
[00:54:20.181 --> 00:54:25.364]  And Gore Vidal said something and he wanted, and I didn't want to pass it on, you know, what he said he'd seen.
[00:54:25.384 --> 00:54:27.465]  I wanted to have him ask Gore Vidal the question.
[00:54:27.485 --> 00:54:28.145]  We're going to take a few calls.
[00:54:28.165 --> 00:54:30.226]  He's going to stay a little bit with us into the next hour.
[00:54:30.306 --> 00:54:31.087]  Gracious to do that.
[00:54:31.587 --> 00:54:35.008]  And we have links up on Infowars.com to his new book, Point to Point.
[00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:36.649]  It's his memoir.
[00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:42.252]  But finishing up that question that we ran into the break, Mr. Vidal, I mean,
[00:54:43.352 --> 00:54:56.419]  With all the other crimes of this administration and their overlords, do you believe that it is in their soul, do you believe they're capable of staging some type of war provocation, some type of terror attack, blowing up a ship, something like that?
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.001]  Well, they certainly know how to cry wolf.
[00:55:00.762 --> 00:55:01.382]  Wolf, wolf.
[00:55:02.362 --> 00:55:03.943]  And I don't mean just Blitzer.
[00:55:05.424 --> 00:55:12.368]  Simultaneously... I think what is going to happen pretty soon
[00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:16.693]  Let's say it was on their mind to stage an event.
[00:55:17.653 --> 00:55:18.754]  I don't know how they can do it.
[00:55:20.176 --> 00:55:24.599]  Luckily for us, we the people who are the sovereign, if they tell us.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.743]  Luckily for us, they've antagonized the entire military.
[00:55:30.404 --> 00:55:31.885]  I don't think the military would let them.
[00:55:32.806 --> 00:55:38.771]  This happened when Richard Nixon was going crazy and he was ordering out the troops and he's ordering this and that.
[00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:45.083]  And Israel was in danger and Kissinger was sending all sorts of aid to them.
[00:55:46.504 --> 00:55:48.264]  And something might have happened then.
[00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:50.265]  But the military wasn't going to let it happen.
[00:55:51.886 --> 00:55:55.688]  And remember, I was born in the cadet hospital at West Point.
[00:55:56.088 --> 00:55:59.389]  My father was the first instructor in aviation there.
[00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:02.070]  I know these military people.
[00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.831]  I've grown up with them all my life.
[00:56:05.311 --> 00:56:08.873]  And there is a point that they really do believe in duty, honor, country.
[00:56:09.963 --> 00:56:13.685]  They have to wait a time before they get to the point, but it's in them.
[00:56:14.365 --> 00:56:15.386]  Well, let me just say this.
[00:56:15.406 --> 00:56:20.769]  I agree that in major polls, 80 plus percent do not trust either party right now.
[00:56:21.069 --> 00:56:24.231]  It's never been that high in modern polling, modern scientific polling.
[00:56:24.907 --> 00:56:25.628]  And so it is a catch-22.
[00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:32.072]  They've got the power, they've got the control, but more and more, you know, the brain gives the orders and the hands won't follow.
[00:56:32.853 --> 00:56:37.056]  But I see them, again, having to do something or the system's going to fall in on them.
[00:56:37.696 --> 00:56:44.901]  Jeremy, you wanted to state something that you saw Mr. Vidal say years ago, just weeks after the attack of 9-11.
[00:56:44.921 --> 00:56:47.503]  Can you repeat what you... because I wanted to get his take on this.
[00:56:48.684 --> 00:56:48.864]  Sure.
[00:56:48.884 --> 00:56:49.544]  Hi, Mr. Vidal.
[00:56:50.805 --> 00:56:53.307]  I thought I'd seen you on a CNN news program
[00:56:53.993 --> 00:56:54.694]  Mr. Vidal, do you remember that?
[00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:35.655]  What made no sense is that CNN wouldn't follow up on why the fighter planes had not been scrambled and gone up to stop the hijackers.
[00:57:36.355 --> 00:57:37.736]  That's the law of the land.
[00:57:38.256 --> 00:57:41.818]  You don't need the president to order you, you don't need a general.
[00:57:42.498 --> 00:57:43.779]  Those are your instructions.
[00:57:44.659 --> 00:57:45.800]  I know, my father wrote them.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:47.420]  Yeah, Jeremy's not...
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:49.360]  No, I didn't.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:50.621]  Why has it not been covered?
[00:58:15.402 --> 00:58:17.103]  It's on the Pentagon website.
[00:58:17.304 --> 00:58:17.584]  You know what?
[00:58:17.664 --> 00:58:20.065]  I've got to send you some of my films during the break if it's okay.
[00:58:20.085 --> 00:58:22.007]  Well, actually, I think I have your address.
[00:58:23.108 --> 00:58:24.308]  I'll send you some of my documentaries.
[00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:28.031]  Jeremy, thanks for bringing up that because that brought up some key info for Mr. Vidal.
[00:58:28.311 --> 00:58:30.353]  Final segment with Gore Vidal on the other side.
[00:58:30.873 --> 00:58:31.754]  We'll take a few calls.
[00:58:31.794 --> 00:58:33.615]  Everybody have your questions and comments ready.
[00:58:34.275 --> 00:58:35.716]  This has just been an amazing interview.
[00:58:35.796 --> 00:58:37.418]  It's conclusion when we return.
[00:58:41.573 --> 00:58:46.397]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.417 --> 00:58:46.597]  Hello!
[00:58:46.637 --> 00:58:47.017]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.057 --> 00:58:47.838]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.058 --> 00:58:51.800]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.622]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.145 --> 00:59:05.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.026 --> 00:59:09.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.871 --> 00:59:13.995]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.416 --> 00:59:26.948]  When you just joined us, I was remaining composed in the last segment, but I was reeling with rage under the surface because I see the news articles where
[00:59:28.593 --> 00:59:37.560]  What happens is you homeschool your children, but when you sign that form, which isn't a law, but you sign a form letting them know you're homeschooling, that's handed over to CPS for harassment.
[00:59:38.461 --> 00:59:39.521]  And this has been in the news.
[00:59:40.042 --> 00:59:41.203]  But they say it's good.
[00:59:41.883 --> 00:59:48.428]  And then they drop by and try to trick their way into your house saying that they want to see the learning environment.
[00:59:48.548 --> 00:59:50.570]  Not even that they even got a message from a neighbor now.
[00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:51.210]  It's not even that.
[00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:54.393]  Or have you had your vaccines and now it's flu shots.
[00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:58.872]  And right here in Austin, they get up on TV and lie and say it's the law to take shots.
[00:59:58.912 --> 00:59:59.672]  There is no law.
[01:00:00.172 --> 01:00:04.593]  They have giant things out at the park at Zilker where thousands of kids line up to get their shots.
[01:00:05.593 --> 01:00:06.754]  It's just all color of law.
[01:00:06.794 --> 01:00:07.614]  It's all frauds.
[01:00:07.674 --> 01:00:10.694]  It's just giant fraud being practiced.
[01:00:11.535 --> 01:00:13.255]  When you let the CPS in, they're scanning.
[01:00:14.015 --> 01:00:15.335]  Most of them are abused as children.
[01:00:15.355 --> 01:00:16.856]  Most of them are CPS themselves.
[01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:23.017]  And, you know, this type of stuff
[01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:25.490]  This type of stuff happens.
[01:00:27.632 --> 01:00:30.174]  And again, in America, this is how we'll be ruled.
[01:00:30.214 --> 01:00:33.497]  We'll have secret police in the guise of social lady.
[01:00:34.078 --> 01:00:34.978]  It's already happening.
[01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:37.200]  It's the new freedom initiative from ages 4 to 18.
[01:00:37.661 --> 01:00:45.448]  Now they're saying in Illinois, everybody, pregnant women, and they come and they interrogate and there's no law, no judge, no jury, no due process.
[01:00:46.308 --> 01:00:47.610]  It's already been going onwards in 6166.
[01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.852]  You know, with Patriot Act, Bush said, well, we've been doing this for years.
[01:00:50.892 --> 01:00:51.353]  They have!
[01:00:52.702 --> 01:00:54.203]  These family courts are just set up.
[01:00:54.243 --> 01:00:56.584]  They have no legal standing.
[01:00:56.605 --> 01:00:57.885]  They just declare their power.
[01:00:57.925 --> 01:00:58.866]  It's all color of law.
[01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:01.928]  And they come in your house looking for dirt to take your children.
[01:01:02.248 --> 01:01:06.471]  When did CPS come to visit when you were gone to work, sir?
[01:01:07.271 --> 01:01:09.673]  Caller here in Austin, Texas, Jesse.
[01:01:09.953 --> 01:01:10.733]  When did this happen?
[01:01:11.874 --> 01:01:14.095]  I'm going to say about a month ago, Alex.
[01:01:16.257 --> 01:01:18.378]  Describe what happened quickly because I've got a guest coming up.
[01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:19.639]  I understand.
[01:01:19.659 --> 01:01:20.740]  I appreciate you holding me over.
[01:01:22.017 --> 01:01:31.863]  They showed up, there was a very small minor discrepancy in which someone felt the need to put their business into our business and have CPS come out.
[01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:34.044]  Oh, one of your neighbors?
[01:01:34.885 --> 01:01:36.005]  Right, they found nothing.
[01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.226]  What does your neighbor claim?
[01:01:38.427 --> 01:01:41.649]  My neighbor claimed that the kids were left in the car for too long.
[01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:49.110]  And, uh, you know, it's one of those things, you get the kids loaded up, oops, forgot something, run back in the house, get it together, run back out the car.
[01:01:49.130 --> 01:02:01.040]  No, no, no, that's your secret police America, they're just, they don't care if there's illegal aliens walking by their house, and they don't care if there's drug dealers, they don't care if the country's imploding and the president's a criminal, but, hey, let's tattle on our neighbors, sure.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.882]  Okay, so then they said, they have their flu shots.
[01:02:04.363 --> 01:02:08.426]  And then they come in, and like you said, they're scanning everything like robots, and, uh,
[01:02:09.153 --> 01:02:15.219]  You know, and this is all according to my wife, but she also said that they asked, um, well, are they up to date on all of their shots?
[01:02:16.059 --> 01:02:19.362]  And she replied, she, she laid it off on me and that's fine.
[01:02:19.382 --> 01:02:25.007]  You know, she said, well, you know, Jesse's a little bit of a conspiracy theorist and he does not want them to have their flu shots.
[01:02:25.648 --> 01:02:30.392]  And, you know, you know, so she, you know, tried to be diplomatic about it.
[01:02:30.432 --> 01:02:32.754]  Which is the absolute wrong thing to do.
[01:02:32.955 --> 01:02:33.555]  I understand.
[01:02:33.635 --> 01:02:35.477]  Well, this is a new awakening for her.
[01:02:36.312 --> 01:02:44.597]  Um, so, as have been many events in the past few years, um, so, you know, she just said, no, they are not up to date on their shots.
[01:02:44.998 --> 01:02:47.879]  Yeah, but she should say, hey, there's no law, lady.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:52.262]  What are you doing here at my house with something that isn't a law, you piece of trash?
[01:02:52.582 --> 01:02:56.705]  Hey, Alex, they better be damn happy that I was not there whenever they showed up at my door.
[01:02:56.725 --> 01:02:57.966]  Listen, you don't answer the door.
[01:02:58.006 --> 01:02:59.607]  The best thing is give them nothing.
[01:03:00.365 --> 01:03:02.547]  The police gotta have a warrant to get in your house.
[01:03:02.787 --> 01:03:04.268]  These people gotta push their way in.
[01:03:04.308 --> 01:03:07.150]  Let me tell you, they profile and they hire mental patients.
[01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:09.531]  Let me tell you, they hire somebody who was abused.
[01:03:09.912 --> 01:03:11.513]  Generally, it's multi-generational.
[01:03:11.573 --> 01:03:13.975]  Most CPS are foster children.
[01:03:14.475 --> 01:03:14.795]  Okay?
[01:03:14.835 --> 01:03:20.159]  Most of them have been gang-raped and on drugs and are they're mental patients or they're pedophiles.
[01:03:20.179 --> 01:03:22.621]  And that's statistically, criminology will tell you that.
[01:03:22.701 --> 01:03:24.202]  Five times more likely to be pedophiles.
[01:03:24.982 --> 01:03:27.685]  And, uh, they're there to get a hold of kids, okay?
[01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.166]  They're the scum of the earth.
[01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:32.328]  They're the absolute, total scum of earth.
[01:03:32.769 --> 01:03:36.332]  I want you to... FightCPS.com Yeah, FightCPS.com.
[01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:37.412]  Is that what you said?
[01:03:37.432 --> 01:03:37.492]  Yes.
[01:03:37.993 --> 01:03:40.015]  Alright, I appreciate you, sir.
[01:03:40.035 --> 01:03:42.757]  You tell your wife she's woken up into the Matrix.
[01:03:43.057 --> 01:03:44.378]  Don't ever open the door.
[01:03:44.818 --> 01:03:50.183]  Because statistically, there's no one more dangerous for children than these creeps.
[01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.070]  It's here!
[01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:02.073]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.433 --> 01:04:10.097]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.777 --> 01:04:17.821]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:25.145]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.641]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.961 --> 01:04:33.482]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.922 --> 01:04:35.843]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.183 --> 01:04:40.104]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.496 --> 01:04:58.721]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:04:58.861 --> 01:05:06.968]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:14.274]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:05:14.454 --> 01:05:15.715]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:05:15.795 --> 01:05:21.698]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:05:21.898 --> 01:05:26.981]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:35.967]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:05:36.247 --> 01:05:39.529]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:42.090]  I think?
[01:05:55.188 --> 01:05:59.329]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:59.549 --> 01:06:01.310]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:07.852]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:08.152 --> 01:06:14.273]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.354]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:06:16.634 --> 01:06:16.994]  I think so.
[01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:42.213]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:42.233 --> 01:06:43.894]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:06.827 --> 01:07:17.429]  We have a Nobel Prize winner, former Chief Economist for the World Bank, joining us, Joseph Stiklitz, tomorrow.
[01:07:18.969 --> 01:07:24.010]  And we are one inch away from Kevin Tillman, Pat Tillman's brother, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:29.191]  We are one inch away from having him here for you.
[01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:32.311]  We had Gore Vidal earlier this week, Aaron Ruschow.
[01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:35.852]  We just, I tell you, Kevin is knocking them out of the park with his producing.
[01:07:37.498 --> 01:07:39.139]  Give credit where credit is due.
[01:07:39.219 --> 01:07:42.081]  We have Robert David Steele joining us.
[01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:46.104]  We have a link to the Wikipedia encyclopedia run down on him.
[01:07:46.144 --> 01:07:49.286]  I don't know how accurate that is, but it matches with other research I've done on him.
[01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.728]  And Robert David Steele.
[01:07:52.805 --> 01:08:00.667]  He is a former Marine Corps Infantry and Intelligence Officer for 20 years and was a second-ranking civilian GS-14 in Marine Corps Intelligence from 88 to 92.
[01:08:01.107 --> 01:08:05.468]  Steele is a former clandestine service case officer with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:08:05.488 --> 01:08:07.849]  He is the founder and CEO of OSS.net.
[01:08:07.869 --> 01:08:10.249]  We have a link to that on Infowars.com if you forgot it.
[01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.950]  And as well as the Golden Candle Society.
[01:08:15.071 --> 01:08:15.691]  He founded that.
[01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:19.652]  Steele also was a member of the adjunct faculty of Marine Corps University in the mid-1990s.
[01:08:21.267 --> 01:08:25.690]  And he is one of the biggest, or the biggest, reviewer for Amazon.com of non-fiction books.
[01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:27.711]  Over 700 books.
[01:08:28.632 --> 01:08:32.815]  And there have been a lot of reports written since he decided to valiantly go public.
[01:08:33.115 --> 01:08:45.544]  We had Bill Christensen, who was over the entire foreign threat analysis group of the CIA, in the top ten of the CIA for many years on, saying he cried over it.
[01:08:45.584 --> 01:08:47.525]  He couldn't believe it took him two years of research
[01:08:48.286 --> 01:08:51.749]  And unfortunately, all evidence points towards quote, total inside job.
[01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:58.596]  That's the only, only, with the data he has in two years of research, it's the only one that fits.
[01:08:58.836 --> 01:08:59.857]  Sure, let it happen.
[01:08:59.877 --> 01:09:00.878]  We're involved a little.
[01:09:01.299 --> 01:09:03.421]  That fits, but not with all the other info.
[01:09:03.441 --> 01:09:05.403]  So, it's horrifying.
[01:09:05.443 --> 01:09:05.943]  It's true.
[01:09:06.164 --> 01:09:06.884]  It's here.
[01:09:07.585 --> 01:09:10.588]  Robert David Steele has read a bunch of books on this subject.
[01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:17.733]  Well, it's my pleasure, and as we were talking before, Amazon is really a very valuable place where people can read opinions that are almost as good as the books themselves.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.322]  So you can search for the truth on Amazon.
[01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:42.242]  Well, that's right.
[01:09:42.262 --> 01:09:47.365]  I mean, I catch myself some nights for an hour just on Amazon, reading the reviews.
[01:09:47.405 --> 01:09:51.027]  Some of them are ten-page treatise.
[01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:53.469]  And I found out about other books and other videos.
[01:09:53.549 --> 01:09:54.029]  It's great.
[01:09:54.389 --> 01:09:59.892]  Well, they do have a thousand-word limit, and I actually do count my words before I post it.
[01:10:00.633 --> 01:10:03.975]  But I try to write summative reviews, not just evaluative reviews.
[01:10:04.795 --> 01:10:09.959]  And I believe we're paying the price right now for our entire citizenry dropping out.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.682]  We have let these guys just get away with murder for too long.
[01:10:15.663 --> 01:10:16.764]  Now, you're a Republican.
[01:10:16.804 --> 01:10:18.505]  You're a highly respected conservative.
[01:10:19.005 --> 01:10:24.749]  Well, I don't know if I'm highly respected and a conservative, but I'm certainly a moderate, middle-of-the-road Republican.
[01:10:24.789 --> 01:10:28.412]  Well, I did several days of research on you, and I know that you've been
[01:10:29.033 --> 01:10:35.877]  You've been cited and quoted a lot by the Republicans, and I mean, I've been a Republican, you know, going back 15 years ago.
[01:10:35.917 --> 01:10:38.259]  I stopped being one about 8 years ago, 9 years ago.
[01:10:38.899 --> 01:10:42.041]  But my point is, you're not some liberal with an axe to grind.
[01:10:42.502 --> 01:10:51.007]  No, as a matter of fact, it was the Tarpley book that took me to a new place, if you will.
[01:10:51.027 --> 01:10:58.012]  I have said on air, and I've read them all, folks, that that is the most sophisticated, basically what I...
[01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:12.858]  The conclusions I had come to studying government-sponsored terror for 10 years, and what I'd come to on 9-11, he put it all together in a way that I'd tried to articulate on air, but you really can't do in a radio format.
[01:11:13.038 --> 01:11:13.798]  He gets it.
[01:11:14.759 --> 01:11:21.564]  I agree with you, and I think what I would say is that I'm still not convinced, and I was just looking at the review that I did on Amazon,
[01:11:22.179 --> 01:11:27.987]  I'm still not convinced enough to convict, but I am most certainly convinced enough to say the U.S.
[01:11:28.007 --> 01:11:32.974]  government did not properly investigate this and there are more rocks to be turned over.
[01:11:33.891 --> 01:11:36.552]  Well, I can read your quotes, they're actually pretty powerful.
[01:11:36.572 --> 01:11:47.877]  You're saying you believe that there should be a criminal investigation, and that there is enough to go after these people, and that once that opened up, that we would find quite a bit.
[01:11:47.917 --> 01:11:54.400]  Can you go over your awakening, your research, when you started looking into 9-11, and kind of the rundown?
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:12:01.683]  Well, my first impression was the impression that they wanted us all to have.
[01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:19.560]  But where it really started breaking down for me was when I read about the, not only the 11 countries that had given us warning prior to 9-11, but the 9-11 Commission did not speak to the general in charge of the watch of the National Intelligence Command Center.
[01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:21.842]  He avoided testimony.
[01:12:22.302 --> 01:12:28.566]  And then when I heard about the 100,000 from the Pakistani Intelligence Service to one of the hijackers right before 9-11,
[01:12:30.526 --> 01:12:43.113]  That really started a cascade of unexplained issues that Tarpley, I think, together with Crossing the Rubicon and several others, I've posted a list of books suitable for evaluating Dick Cheney.
[01:12:43.834 --> 01:12:48.336]  There's no question in my own mind that Dick Cheney is the Tar Baby in this thing.
[01:12:49.617 --> 01:12:49.957]  I agree.
[01:12:49.997 --> 01:12:58.003]  He is the nexus point, clearly with the PNAC documents, clearly two months before 9-11, taking the shoot-down powers for the first time in U.S.
[01:12:58.043 --> 01:13:02.286]  history, away from the Pentagon, away from NORAD.
[01:13:02.926 --> 01:13:08.149]  You then have him in control that morning in the bunker saying the order still stands, it's 50 miles out, it's 30, it's 20, it's 10.
[01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.951]  Of course the order still stands, if you heard anything to the contrary.
[01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:17.392]  Then you get into the CIA drills, the lies, claiming they never heard of such a plan.
[01:13:17.472 --> 01:13:24.835]  Clearly foreign intelligence was picking up InfoPol 9 and Echelon feeds, picking up the back chatter.
[01:13:25.295 --> 01:13:35.258]  FBI that picked up the chatter tried to go bust at least the Patsy's and the Moles, who were creating the legend and the story, were being protected from the highest levels.
[01:13:35.298 --> 01:13:36.458]  Would you like to continue?
[01:13:36.718 --> 01:13:41.382]  Well, I'm not sure I'm as far over as you are in the conspiracy theory.
[01:13:41.802 --> 01:13:45.145]  If I'm given a choice between incompetence and conspiracy with the U.S.
[01:13:45.185 --> 01:13:46.826]  government, I'll usually go with incompetence.
[01:13:47.226 --> 01:13:51.449]  But I am absolutely certain that WTC7 was brought down with controlled demolitions.
[01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:57.014]  And that, as far as I'm concerned, means that this case has not been properly investigated.
[01:13:57.154 --> 01:13:58.355]  And that was a spookhive!
[01:13:58.966 --> 01:14:00.547]  Well, it was a government building.
[01:14:00.607 --> 01:14:02.348]  It was a federal government building, yes.
[01:14:02.408 --> 01:14:06.229]  Would you call Defense Intelligence, FBI, CIA, the Army?
[01:14:06.249 --> 01:14:07.490]  I mean, it was a spookhive.
[01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:12.192]  Well, there's no way that building could have come down without controlled demolition.
[01:14:13.678 --> 01:14:17.721]  And do you notice how they act suspicious and very secretive?
[01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:20.903]  Not one word in the 9-11 Commission about it.
[01:14:21.443 --> 01:14:23.985]  Five different reasons from FEMA and NIST for the collapse.
[01:14:24.005 --> 01:14:27.087]  Now they're saying they're having to look at explosions.
[01:14:27.107 --> 01:14:37.074]  I mean, clearly, why did they... I mean, obviously, Al-Qaeda couldn't sneak in there and plant bombs to bring it down with that perfect classical textbook job.
[01:14:37.294 --> 01:14:41.217]  Well, I mean, you do have the whole issue of
[01:14:42.237 --> 01:14:44.440]  The security camera is being disengaged.
[01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.263]  The bomb-sniffing dog is being removed.
[01:14:48.225 --> 01:14:49.907]  The family ties with Bush.
[01:14:50.666 --> 01:14:55.590]  You know, I mean, if you smell rotten fish, there's probably a rotten fish somewhere around.
[01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:59.953]  Well, I mean, taking your skills, I mean, you were in the field with the Marine Corps.
[01:14:59.993 --> 01:15:02.735]  You did, you know, serious clandestine operations.
[01:15:02.795 --> 01:15:09.099]  I mean, you've got a snout for smelling rotten fish, but I mean, we're in a giant, you know, bucket of rotten fish here.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.141]  I mean, it's hard to come away with a conclusion.
[01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.462]  You think I want to believe this?
[01:15:13.482 --> 01:15:14.343]  I don't want to believe this.
[01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:18.626]  Well, there I agree with you, and I frankly am stunned.
[01:15:20.122 --> 01:15:22.744]  I think the American public is just starting to wake up.
[01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:30.271]  But I have been stunned that the numerous discrepancies haven't made it onto CNN.
[01:15:31.612 --> 01:15:34.855]  Lou Dobbs is doing a very good job on broken government.
[01:15:35.476 --> 01:15:41.882]  In fact, I'm featuring a secessionist speaker from Vermont at my conference in January because
[01:15:42.768 --> 01:15:53.182]  I believe this is a republic and that the citizens can dissolve the government when it gets to a point of corruption and ineffectiveness so great as to warrant a new constitutional convention.
[01:15:53.643 --> 01:15:56.086]  I think our government is indeed broken.
[01:15:57.367 --> 01:15:59.408]  Well, but from their view, it's not broken.
[01:15:59.448 --> 01:16:17.037]  We are seeing an imperium form of select global corporations that have brought off our government and they're using, dissolving us as not even an engine, but a fuel for an engine for global hegemon that I think we're later going to be basically broken up the end of the... You know, I think you're right.
[01:16:17.197 --> 01:16:21.919]  I take a very strong interest in what's called predatory immoral capitalism.
[01:16:22.626 --> 01:16:35.874]  And I would like to mention a book by Michael Lewis called Liar's Poker, which is basically an insider's look at how Wall Street gets into all of these investments early on, and then they leave the citizens holding the bag.
[01:16:36.694 --> 01:16:46.940]  And so, in my view, we have never had as much concentration of wealth among the fewest Americans in our history.
[01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:51.063]  And concentrated wealth is one of the things that leads to revolution.
[01:16:52.501 --> 01:16:55.623]  Yeah, and the neocons will say, oh, you're against free market.
[01:16:56.483 --> 01:16:58.404]  Much of this has not been gained through free market.
[01:16:58.464 --> 01:17:08.769]  It's been gained through mafia triads working in unison to basically extract corporate welfare to fuel their expansion.
[01:17:09.469 --> 01:17:15.332]  Well, one of the things, if you've read John Perkins' Confessions of an Economic Hitman... Yes, we have interviewed him, yes.
[01:17:16.472 --> 01:17:17.093]  Well, that's good.
[01:17:17.153 --> 01:17:21.255]  I don't think he worked for NSA, but I think there's enough meat to his story so that I'd buy 85% of it.
[01:17:22.765 --> 01:17:41.748]  And what I find really astonishing, and there's another book called The Global Class War, basically the American elite has conspired with other public elites, they've bribed other governments, and essentially the American public is being ripped off at the same time that foreign publics are being ripped off.
[01:17:41.768 --> 01:17:43.069]  Well, that's right, it's a mass looting.
[01:17:43.109 --> 01:17:44.829]  I mean, that's the CFR model.
[01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:49.930]  Not only is it mass looting, but those foreigners blame us.
[01:17:51.787 --> 01:17:53.268]  I mean, they blame us, the people.
[01:17:53.388 --> 01:17:55.550]  That's what I'm saying, we've been shut up to take the fall later.
[01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:56.010]  Yes.
[01:17:57.091 --> 01:17:59.412]  Oh, you really, oh, I tell you, you've got it, absolutely.
[01:18:00.693 --> 01:18:09.760]  I mean, in fact, I see Rupert Murdoch overseas attacking America, meanwhile he puts out domestic propaganda to keep us in line until it's too late, and they're just shutting us up.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.101]  It's a big scam.
[01:18:11.461 --> 01:18:21.248]  Well, one of the reasons, I just published a book, and I gotta say, there's a really fantastic congressman in Connecticut, Congressman Rob Simmons, is a moderate Republican,
[01:18:22.139 --> 01:18:29.841]  He's going into, he's running for his fourth term, he's on the Homeland Security Committee, and he has agreed to sponsor the Smart Nation Act.
[01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:35.982]  And what I really want to do is create a public intelligence network that is of, by, and for the people.
[01:18:36.122 --> 01:18:37.803]  Yes, that's what it is.
[01:18:37.823 --> 01:18:38.803]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:18:38.823 --> 01:18:48.805]  Well, just using only legal, ethical information, but I absolutely believe now that the collective intelligence of the American people is superior.
[01:18:49.545 --> 01:18:51.646]  To any orchestrator... Stay there, we got a break.
[01:18:51.686 --> 01:18:52.227]  Stay there, sir.
[01:18:52.247 --> 01:18:52.667]  We got a break.
[01:18:59.131 --> 01:19:01.232]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:19:01.713 --> 01:19:02.393]  One and the same.
[01:19:03.134 --> 01:19:07.116]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:16.504]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:19:16.764 --> 01:19:18.605]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:19:18.845 --> 01:19:21.666]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:19:22.227 --> 01:19:24.448]  Here is reality.
[01:19:24.828 --> 01:19:28.410]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:32.552]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:19:33.112 --> 01:19:35.933]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:41.017]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[01:19:58.942 --> 01:20:04.809]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[01:20:05.489 --> 01:20:14.800]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?

[01:20:55.797 --> 01:20:57.337]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:20:57.737 --> 01:20:57.997]  What?
[01:20:58.358 --> 01:20:58.698]  Again?
[01:20:59.138 --> 01:21:00.758]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:21:00.818 --> 01:21:05.240]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:06.780]  Why did you do that?
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:12.782]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:21:13.062 --> 01:21:14.102]  Are we there yet?
[01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:15.303]  for the entire trip.
[01:21:15.523 --> 01:21:17.724]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:21:18.204 --> 01:21:19.204]  Great idea.
[01:21:19.224 --> 01:21:22.065]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:21:22.443 --> 01:21:29.508]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:21:29.788 --> 01:21:32.170]  Honey, you're terrific!
[01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:34.051]  Oh honey, so are you.
[01:21:34.172 --> 01:21:37.574]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey water bottles.
[01:21:37.854 --> 01:21:38.655]  Now can we stop?
[01:21:39.135 --> 01:21:39.876]  I need to go too.

[01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:28.091]  I think so.
[01:23:16.873 --> 01:23:18.394]  I tell you, we've got him for the rest of the hour.
[01:23:18.434 --> 01:23:20.234]  We've got to get him back on as a routine guest.
[01:23:20.354 --> 01:23:22.155]  Let him talk more about the book he just published.
[01:23:22.335 --> 01:23:23.375]  An amazing individual.
[01:23:24.176 --> 01:23:26.677]  A high-level Marine Corps intelligence, then with the CIA.
[01:23:28.377 --> 01:23:31.778]  And we're honored to have Robert David Steele.
[01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:33.379]  In fact, he's never heard of me.
[01:23:33.439 --> 01:23:34.859]  I've never talked to him.
[01:23:34.899 --> 01:23:44.683]  And here he is talking about this organic intelligence network, the people, and how that interfaces with the Internet and how we're able to track the information and be so effective without the political
[01:23:45.402 --> 01:23:46.443]  Blinders that are put on.
[01:23:46.623 --> 01:23:48.645]  Please continue, sir, then I want to get into 9-11.
[01:23:49.966 --> 01:23:53.588]  Well, I believe in the common sense of the American people.
[01:23:55.430 --> 01:24:02.295]  I believe that the American people have been dormant for too long and they need to take their country back.
[01:24:03.536 --> 01:24:12.263]  Not only from illegal immigration, but from corrupt Congress members and from extremists in the White House.
[01:24:13.959 --> 01:24:25.850]  The middle road is the best road and I am concerned that we won't do enough housecleaning in this November election and we're going to waste two more
[01:24:32.339 --> 01:24:34.241]  We're going to waste two more years.
[01:24:34.381 --> 01:24:43.227]  I will tell you, some of the experts that I've talked to and listened to basically say it's going to take 25 years to undo the damage that George Bush and Dick Cheney have done to this country.
[01:24:43.968 --> 01:24:45.929]  We have lost our moral standing in the world.
[01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:51.553]  We have lost more dead in the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq than were murdered on 9-11.
[01:24:51.934 --> 01:24:56.137]  And we have the bonus of 65,000 amputees whose lives have been ruined.
[01:24:57.204 --> 01:25:07.950]  And they've salted the earth with DU and Bush's signed HR 6166 that I've read and the scholars agree does affect citizens.
[01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:11.152]  He's buying billions in fake news and paying off reporters.
[01:25:11.612 --> 01:25:12.933]  I think they're going for broke.
[01:25:13.053 --> 01:25:16.435]  I mean, using your intelligence analyst skills,
[01:25:17.015 --> 01:25:22.937]  I mean, everything I see shows they're going for broke, and even Bob Woodward says he may be going for dictatorship.
[01:25:23.177 --> 01:25:25.937]  They could start a war with Iran, they could stage more terror attacks.
[01:25:26.298 --> 01:25:28.018]  I mean, what do you think the probability of that is?
[01:25:29.178 --> 01:25:41.602]  I am very concerned, and there's actually a book out called The Endgame, in which a General McInerney and another officer basically lay out the neocon plan, and you can find that book on Amazon.
[01:25:41.642 --> 01:25:43.182]  I don't particularly recommend buying it.
[01:25:43.823 --> 01:25:59.449]  But it is a very, very serious agenda for basically after Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, these guys are looking at nothing less than nuking them back into the Stone Age and keeping the oil.
[01:25:59.909 --> 01:26:00.910]  That's just nuts!
[01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:13.455]  But the real target in all of this is also the West, during this psychological clash like in 1984, but in the real world, Oceania being knocked back into the Stone Age liberty-wise.
[01:26:15.841 --> 01:26:17.561]  I find it troubling.
[01:26:18.482 --> 01:26:21.002]  Iraq is never going to be a democracy like ours.
[01:26:21.622 --> 01:26:24.663]  And if they had a vote tomorrow, they would vote for a theocracy.
[01:26:24.923 --> 01:26:27.164]  But the neocons said they never intended it.
[01:26:27.184 --> 01:26:34.405]  They just told the public that they meant to break it in three parts and basically go into each country and break it down and make sure they never develop.
[01:26:34.865 --> 01:26:41.407]  Well, I don't know what they were thinking, but I will tell you that the same week that Cheney was meeting secretly with Exxon and Enron,
[01:26:42.526 --> 01:26:49.971]  Wired Magazine published a very intelligent cover story on alternative energies and the price points at which they become affordable.
[01:26:50.011 --> 01:26:51.592]  Well, they all just became affordable.
[01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:53.994]  Absolutely.
[01:26:55.935 --> 01:26:58.397]  So what do you see happening in the next two years?
[01:26:59.426 --> 01:27:00.666]  I'm very troubled.
[01:27:00.866 --> 01:27:01.987]  I mean, I'm really worried.
[01:27:03.267 --> 01:27:04.628]  This is a wonderful country.
[01:27:04.668 --> 01:27:08.929]  You fly across this country and you see so much wide open space and stuff.
[01:27:08.949 --> 01:27:16.111]  But, you know, I have on my website, OSS.net, I have the 10 threats.
[01:27:16.151 --> 01:27:25.654]  I have a public daily brief and the 10 threats identified by the United Nations, which our federal government ignores, all but 8 and 9, proliferation and terrorism.
[01:27:26.798 --> 01:27:29.939]  And then there are 12 policies, and one of those policies is water.
[01:27:30.399 --> 01:27:32.440]  This country is running out of water.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.581]  There are going to be water wars all over the world.
[01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:49.826]  We, and the Comptroller General, who's a very serious man, David Walker, he's appointed for a 15-year position, he's been telling Congress over and over and over, in the harshest possible terms, that we're not budgeting for the future.
[01:27:50.405 --> 01:27:53.568]  Well, I mean, sir, look at LCRA here in Central Texas.
[01:27:53.588 --> 01:27:58.172]  They're grabbing up all the water to shut it off to artificially jack up prices.
[01:27:58.833 --> 01:28:06.579]  Well, that shouldn't be allowed either, but I will tell you that we should be paying, and this may shock you, we should be paying as much for water as we're paying for gas now.
[01:28:08.641 --> 01:28:09.422]  It's just crazy.
[01:28:09.482 --> 01:28:14.426]  I mean, you know, an aquifer, once it runs out of water and salt water comes in, is gone for 10,000 years.
[01:28:15.802 --> 01:28:20.324]  We should be building, it costs a hundred million dollars to build water desalination plants.
[01:28:20.804 --> 01:28:31.509]  We should be putting two into California, two into Texas, two into Florida, and we should be pumping fresh, distilled seawater, converted into plain water, back into the aquifers.
[01:28:31.829 --> 01:28:34.750]  Yeah, no one's planning for the future, you're right.
[01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:41.453]  Stay there, let's get back into 9-11 on the other side with our guest, an amazing individual, Robert Steele.
[01:28:43.832 --> 01:28:44.734]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.235 --> 01:28:46.837]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.857 --> 01:28:50.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:57.476]  You know, I really wish I could just power my place with solar.
[01:28:59.075 --> 01:29:05.260]  That's what I was saying to myself over and over again for years until I found out about Ken Solar.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:12.186]  Ken has been working with solar power for over a decade and has designed systems for people all over the world.
[01:29:12.566 --> 01:29:21.634]  He's put together customized alternative energy packages for everything from powering the local supermarket all the way down to portable solar power generators.
[01:29:23.183 --> 01:29:33.337]  Off-grid, big systems or tiny systems, Ken has the proven experience to design a tailored alternative energy system that's just right for you and your budget.
[01:29:33.737 --> 01:29:37.963]  He'll also show you how a system can pay for itself in the first month.
[01:29:38.363 --> 01:29:41.163]  So if you're looking for solar, check out KenSolar.
[01:29:41.384 --> 01:29:46.724]  Tell Ken you heard about him on GCN and he'll give you an additional 10% off your order.
[01:29:47.024 --> 01:29:49.925]  Just point your browser at KenSolar.com.
[01:29:49.965 --> 01:29:52.765]  That's KenSolar.com.
[01:29:53.226 --> 01:29:58.486]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:29:58.706 --> 01:30:00.787]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:30:01.027 --> 01:30:08.128]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:30:08.268 --> 01:30:19.815]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:30:20.195 --> 01:30:27.560]  Its multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:32.823]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:30:32.983 --> 01:30:37.966]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:43.791]  Get the Incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.891 --> 01:30:48.414]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:48.675 --> 01:30:49.695]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.784 --> 01:31:00.206]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[01:31:00.626 --> 01:31:05.387]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:31:05.767 --> 01:31:08.388]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:31:08.888 --> 01:31:12.289]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:17.391]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:31:17.831 --> 01:31:21.012]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:31:21.612 --> 01:31:24.453]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:27.372]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[01:31:27.412 --> 01:31:29.173]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:31:29.193 --> 01:31:29.293]  U.S.
[01:31:29.393 --> 01:31:31.615]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[01:31:31.635 --> 01:31:31.915]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[01:31:31.935 --> 01:31:33.095]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[01:31:33.115 --> 01:31:33.936]  Ask for George.
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:59.461]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:31:59.941 --> 01:32:06.605]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.685 --> 01:32:14.288]  Before this hour ends, we'll take a few calls for Mr. Steele, former Marine Corps Intelligence Officer, former CIA Intelligence Officer.
[01:32:16.369 --> 01:32:21.192]  He's one of the biggest, the biggest fiction, non-fiction reviewer on Amazon.com.
[01:32:21.693 --> 01:32:23.534]  And he's read a bunch of 9-11 books and videos.
[01:32:23.574 --> 01:32:23.994]  Listen to this.
[01:32:24.014 --> 01:32:27.036]  9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA, 3rd edition.
[01:32:27.056 --> 01:32:30.739]  And he says, among hundreds of books, the strongest approach to truth.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:38.144]  It is with great sadness that I conclude that this book is the strongest of the 770 plus books I've reviewed here at Amazon.
[01:32:39.469 --> 01:32:40.590]  Almost all non-fiction.
[01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:45.174]  I am forced to conclude that 9-11 was at minimum allowed to happen as a pretext for war.
[01:32:45.734 --> 01:32:47.956]  See my review of James Bamford's pretext for war.
[01:32:48.356 --> 01:32:51.919]  And I am forced to conclude that there is sufficient evidence to indict
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.401]  We're good to go.
[01:33:11.677 --> 01:33:14.319]  The connecting rod between the Nazi fascists and the neocons.
[01:33:14.679 --> 01:33:24.724]  This is, without question, the most important modern reference of state-sponsored terrorism, and also the reference that most pointedly suggests that select rogue elements within the U.S.
[01:33:24.764 --> 01:33:34.610]  government, most likely led by Dick Cheney, with the assistance of George Tenet, Buzzy Krongard, and others, close to the Wall Street gangs, are the most guilty of state-sponsored terrorism.
[01:33:35.842 --> 01:33:38.083]  The author draws on historical examples of the U.S.
[01:33:38.123 --> 01:33:44.784]  fabrication of events, the bombing of USS Maine and Havana Harbor, and many others, Jim Vanford's politicization of Northwoods.
[01:33:45.965 --> 01:33:48.505]  It is an undeniable fact that the U.S.
[01:33:48.525 --> 01:33:53.287]  government has been willing to kill its own citizens and fabricate attacks as part of moving the public.
[01:33:53.647 --> 01:33:59.508]  Okay, let me, before we go back to our guest, while he's on hold there, please go to InfoWars.com.
[01:34:03.416 --> 01:34:04.858]  That was a hint to the folks around the show.
[01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:17.955]  Please go to InfoWars.com and please get Webster Tarpley's third edition that we have right now of Synthetic Terror.
[01:34:18.155 --> 01:34:19.276]  It's been out for two years.
[01:34:19.356 --> 01:34:20.257]  It's in its third edition.
[01:34:20.278 --> 01:34:21.319]  It's been beefed up.
[01:34:22.276 --> 01:34:24.577]  And it's an excellent, excellent book.
[01:34:25.317 --> 01:34:31.138]  And it goes through how they orchestrate it, how they do it, how they control it, really from all the evidence, how they did 9-11.
[01:34:31.798 --> 01:34:35.979]  You need to have 9-11 Synthetic Terror made in the USA by Webster Tarpley.
[01:34:36.059 --> 01:34:39.500]  We sell it at InfoWars.com, the secure online video and bookstore.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:42.060]  You get a great book to be a true expert on 9-11.
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.081]  You support Webster, you support this show.
[01:34:44.541 --> 01:34:50.522]  And while you're at it, get Aaron Russo's new America, Freedom from Fascism, just out on DVD, and my new film, Terror Storm,
[01:34:51.182 --> 01:34:52.164]  Yes, we're good.
[01:35:07.365 --> 01:35:16.533]  And I'm here telling you, Terror Storm is the definitive video on government-sponsored terror, and Webster Tarpley's Synthetic Terror is the definitive book.
[01:35:17.013 --> 01:35:22.558]  I concur, and I said that long before he did the review, on air, when we've had Webster on, telling you, this is the book.
[01:35:23.098 --> 01:35:23.998]  This is the book.
[01:35:24.038 --> 01:35:28.600]  You need to get it at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:28.900]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:37.323]  So get America Freedom from Fascism.
[01:35:37.383 --> 01:35:38.164]  Get Terror Storm.
[01:35:38.984 --> 01:35:40.224]  Get Synthetic Terror.
[01:35:40.264 --> 01:35:42.405]  Get that book and those two videos right now.
[01:35:42.425 --> 01:35:45.246]  It's so important at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:45.266 --> 01:35:46.887]  When you get Freedom from Fascism for $19.95,
[01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:52.397]  Guess how much Terror Storm is for a limited time?
[01:35:52.417 --> 01:35:52.397]  $9.95.
[01:35:52.457 --> 01:35:55.381]  It's almost two hours long with 68 minutes of extras.
[01:35:55.821 --> 01:35:56.823]  It's a powerful film.
[01:35:57.183 --> 01:35:57.864]  Get Terror Storm.
[01:35:58.505 --> 01:36:02.190]  Going back to our guest, back to Mr. Steele.
[01:36:04.463 --> 01:36:16.153]  Robert Steele, let's get more into 9-11, more into your review, more of what you think the big smoking guns... I mean, that's pretty strong language of you to say, you know, you think we can have an indictment, and I agree.
[01:36:17.394 --> 01:36:32.127]  Please continue, and from your research on 9-11, reading all the big books on it, looking at Tarpley's work, if it is an inside job, which the evidence points towards... Well, let me move you away from 9-11 and simply look at impeachment.
[01:36:33.419 --> 01:36:54.969]  I've reviewed several books on impeachment, and it's now a documented fact, and in fact Al Gore was talked out of contesting the Florida election, but it's a documented fact that Rove stole the Florida election with the connivance of Jeb Bush, disenfranchising 35,000 or more people of color.
[01:36:55.289 --> 01:36:55.869]  That's a fact.
[01:36:56.429 --> 01:36:59.951]  That election was stolen, and they did it again in 2004 in Ohio with 12
[01:37:03.744 --> 01:37:09.867]  Twelve districts, again, working through the Secretary of State in Ohio, stole the election.
[01:37:10.447 --> 01:37:15.851]  And that's just unbelievable to me, that then we would have an elective war in Iraq, based on a web of lies.
[01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:21.954]  General Zinni, myself, several others spoke out and said, this is nonsense, and we were called traitors.
[01:37:22.574 --> 01:37:25.516]  Dissent is treason under this administration.
[01:37:25.956 --> 01:37:28.998]  And then you have Katrina, which was an inexcusable
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:29.941]  Bumbling!
[01:37:31.443 --> 01:37:34.707]  That alone demonstrates this government is incompetent.
[01:37:34.727 --> 01:37:35.788]  See, I disagree with you.
[01:37:36.409 --> 01:37:46.062]  Reading P2OG, reading the Israeli plan of 83, where they said break Iraq in three parts, sectarian war, good weapons sales, cut off the oil, jack up prices.
[01:37:47.883 --> 01:38:07.876]  I mean, maybe you'll elaborate, and maybe I don't disagree, but I look at Katrina, FEMA jammed communications, cut police lines, police had to aim guns at them to stop sabotaging communication, blocking the Coast Guard coming in, blocking the police and local firemen and others coming in, blocking Walmart.
[01:38:08.197 --> 01:38:10.218]  They wanted that to be as bad as possible.
[01:38:11.127 --> 01:38:13.448]  Then it doesn't matter if they take a hit and look bad in the press.
[01:38:13.808 --> 01:38:18.749]  Then they get to having a bigger disaster, hundreds of billions in no-bid contracts to Halliburton and others.
[01:38:18.789 --> 01:38:20.870]  Then FEMA goes, oh, see, we need more power.
[01:38:20.890 --> 01:38:26.112]  I see it as another problem-reaction solution, just like I read.
[01:38:26.212 --> 01:38:28.632]  Well, let me tell you what brings this home to us.
[01:38:28.932 --> 01:38:33.794]  What brings this home to us is the explosion in suicide bombings.
[01:38:34.934 --> 01:38:40.576]  There's a wonderful book called Dying to Win by Professor Pate from the University of Chicago.
[01:38:41.673 --> 01:38:46.275]  Suicide, the willingness to commit suicide, changes everything.
[01:38:46.695 --> 01:38:49.256]  Because it is the ultimate asymmetric factor.
[01:38:49.636 --> 01:38:58.700]  What this means is that a suicide bomber is coming to a shopping mall near you, or to an elementary school, and unfortunately we have our own homegrown terrorists.
[01:38:59.781 --> 01:39:04.262]  And we have our own, there's another book called Random Actors, where people just go postal.
[01:39:05.643 --> 01:39:10.585]  So I am very, very concerned that the entire world is becoming very, very unstable
[01:39:11.264 --> 01:39:18.787]  And I'm not sure that these elites really understand that ten years from today, there's not going to be any gated community where they can hide.
[01:39:19.247 --> 01:39:23.429]  They're going to have to do a Ken Lay and die before their estate can be contested.
[01:39:24.609 --> 01:39:25.970]  Oh, that was real suspicious.
[01:39:27.571 --> 01:39:28.651]  I'm just blown away.
[01:39:29.451 --> 01:39:34.894]  And because he didn't have a chance to appeal, his hairs are allowed to keep his ill-gotten means.
[01:39:34.934 --> 01:39:35.674]  That's just wrong.
[01:39:36.778 --> 01:39:39.281]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:39:40.142 --> 01:39:47.590]  No, no, certainly in the P2OG plan, they say they're going to stimulate terrorist attacks, they're going to go out and kill people's families.
[01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:56.660]  It actually says this, Pentagon Plan, $6 billion program every year, in Iraq, the Middle East, they're going to go stimulate and create terrorists in the name of, quote,
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:00.262]  You know, widening the war, being able to, quote, go in and get them.
[01:40:00.642 --> 01:40:02.823]  So certainly they are, I mean, I see it this way.
[01:40:03.243 --> 01:40:10.866]  You've got real terrorism, normally not spectacular, a woman going crazy with a knife on a bus, stabbing 14 people, a person blowing themselves up.
[01:40:11.206 --> 01:40:14.888]  You do have that real warfare going on, desperation.
[01:40:15.128 --> 01:40:18.450]  Then you've got the provocateur actions that I see as the lion's share from history.
[01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:21.431]  Then you've got pure state-sponsored events like 9-11.
[01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:23.512]  What's your take on that statement?
[01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:29.503]  Believe it or not, I believe in non-violence.
[01:40:30.263 --> 01:40:32.125]  And I believe that Gandhi had it right.
[01:40:33.566 --> 01:40:37.109]  I also believe in the truth eventually being discovered.
[01:40:37.249 --> 01:40:41.693]  I personally think America needs two Truth and Reconciliation Commissions.
[01:40:42.413 --> 01:40:49.159]  One for all the bad things we've done to the rest of the world, and one for all the bad things we've done to our own public, our poor, our working poor.
[01:40:49.219 --> 01:40:50.940]  Working poor is an oxymoron.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:51.561]  It shouldn't be.
[01:40:52.628 --> 01:40:53.929]  But there's a book by that name.
[01:40:53.989 --> 01:40:59.132]  I mean, we're basically screwing the middle class, and we're screwing the earnest blue-collar workers in this country.
[01:40:59.152 --> 01:41:00.253]  Well, let me bring this up to you.
[01:41:00.994 --> 01:41:06.977]  If you look at the top list, and I've seen this on my shelf over and over, and I was listening to Derry Brownville today, and he had a guest on, talking about it.
[01:41:07.698 --> 01:41:11.200]  And you go to UT to try to hire the top 25 engineering staff.
[01:41:12.208 --> 01:41:13.708]  Three of them are American.
[01:41:13.728 --> 01:41:15.309]  The rest are all from India and China.
[01:41:15.549 --> 01:41:15.789]  Yeah.
[01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:16.789]  Okay.
[01:41:16.849 --> 01:41:18.170]  You go to Georgetown.
[01:41:18.730 --> 01:41:21.211]  Again, maybe one is American.
[01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:26.032]  You go to MIT, maybe ten are American, and then hundreds aren't.
[01:41:26.392 --> 01:41:28.853]  And then they all go back to their countries with the technology.
[01:41:28.893 --> 01:41:33.014]  They all go back with what our forefathers and our incredible genius built.
[01:41:33.594 --> 01:41:35.995]  We were the place where all the inventions came from, everything.
[01:41:36.555 --> 01:41:40.756]  And now we have literally... I know there's a big group that's intelligent and informed still, but
[01:41:41.565 --> 01:41:46.670]  The average American literally has been turned into some type of low-level animal who just feeds their beast to you.
[01:41:46.710 --> 01:41:59.282]  Well, that's exactly right, because we still have a school system that is not only created to manufacture factory workers, but it's funded based on real estate taxes, which means a lot of people don't get an even break.
[01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:02.473]  You just said it, but see, that's by design.
[01:42:02.793 --> 01:42:04.314]  It's by design they've dumbed them down.
[01:42:04.334 --> 01:42:08.739]  I've got the Department of Education documents going back to the 60s and through the 80s.
[01:42:08.779 --> 01:42:10.480]  I've interviewed the number two at the Department of Education.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.942]  They openly said they were there to dumb people down.
[01:42:12.202 --> 01:42:13.944]  But then, Katrina isn't on purpose.
[01:42:13.964 --> 01:42:14.765]  That is the response.
[01:42:15.085 --> 01:42:15.946]  It is on purpose.
[01:42:16.006 --> 01:42:18.889]  I mean, all the evidence shows this is coordinated.
[01:42:19.209 --> 01:42:23.093]  Why do they want to destroy America that was such an engine of their dominance?
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:28.442]  I don't know, but I'll tell you what I believe is the solution.
[01:42:28.582 --> 01:42:31.444]  I believe the solution is a public intelligence network.
[01:42:31.984 --> 01:42:37.808]  I think Larry brilliant that Google is one of the most important people on the planet because of what he can do.
[01:42:38.508 --> 01:42:46.512]  Jimbo Wales from Wikipedia has just put out word that he's willing to spend a hundred million dollars to free key information from copyright.
[01:42:47.313 --> 01:42:52.616]  You have Brewster Kahle with the Internet Archives and he's digitizing books all over the world.
[01:42:53.877 --> 01:43:04.266]  I believe that if we can create an open source agency, such as Congressman Simmons is planning to introduce, that within five years we can cut the secret intelligence budget in half.
[01:43:04.742 --> 01:43:07.645]  Even by two-thirds, from $60 billion down to $20 billion.
[01:43:07.665 --> 01:43:12.029]  Okay, well, sir, now you're an intelligence expert, highest levels of the Marine Corps and CIA.
[01:43:12.649 --> 01:43:14.110]  Average people aren't going to get this.
[01:43:14.871 --> 01:43:30.565]  Again, I organically have come upon this, the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of researchers vetting each other's info, scanning everything, doing research using the NSA-type technology of the search engine drivers to go out and collate as analysts just because, in a hobby,
[01:43:31.005 --> 01:43:32.646]  Well, first off, let me give you the bad news.
[01:43:32.666 --> 01:43:37.250]  Your government is spending $60 billion a year for the 5% of the information they can steal.
[01:43:51.175 --> 01:43:56.997]  They're spending less than $600 million a year on what's called open source information in multiple languages.
[01:43:57.097 --> 01:44:00.639]  Yeah, they'll pay for millions to find out something that was in a news article a year before.
[01:44:01.419 --> 01:44:12.383]  No, they'll pay billions to have a Lockheed Martin build a secret satellite that can't see into city streets or under jungle canopy.
[01:44:13.528 --> 01:44:22.414]  The point I want to make here is that we are spending way too much money on spies and secrecy and not nearly enough money on education and diplomacy.
[01:44:23.642 --> 01:44:40.888]  And if we just have consultants, I mean that's what real companies do, they just have people that go around finding out, I had a guest in here a few weeks ago, working for big companies that just track things for the stock market and different derivatives, and they've just got people all over the world going and talking to average folks.
[01:44:40.908 --> 01:44:43.109]  I mean, they're getting on-the-ground intelligence.
[01:44:43.469 --> 01:44:49.171]  Yes, and in fact, it's been proven that on-the-ground intelligence is better than what you can get from satellites.
[01:44:50.657 --> 01:44:52.980]  And there's just no substitute for human beings.
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:45:02.951]  Now, what the secret world doesn't want you to know is that public intelligence is a hundred times better than secret intelligence at a tiny fraction of the price.
[01:45:05.154 --> 01:45:07.916]  Well, I mean, what is the power of Google?
[01:45:07.976 --> 01:45:09.257]  Obviously, the best search engine.
[01:45:09.297 --> 01:45:10.958]  I mean, I can find out so much.
[01:45:11.058 --> 01:45:11.918]  Cross-reference.
[01:45:12.459 --> 01:45:15.461]  I mean, that really is NSA-type power.
[01:45:16.161 --> 01:45:21.505]  And these guys don't even have that many analysts, from what I've seen, even using that.
[01:45:21.525 --> 01:45:27.588]  In fact, they spend most of their time trying to use the apparatchik of intelligence to cover up their own corporate crimes.
[01:45:27.869 --> 01:45:30.230]  Well, Google has some growing up to do.
[01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:31.931]  I really admire Google.
[01:45:32.271 --> 01:45:34.633]  And I think one of these days it will eat Amazon.
[01:45:35.191 --> 01:45:43.334]  And that'll be a good thing, because the next big thing in information is synthetic information.
[01:45:43.835 --> 01:45:46.176]  That breaks the copyright chain.
[01:45:46.956 --> 01:45:54.519]  So a Google can give you an answer that is synthetically derived from millions of pages that they own free and clear.
[01:45:54.599 --> 01:45:55.520]  Which is new, yeah.
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:56.560]  Yes, it is new.
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:58.941]  And then if you want, you can pay for the footnotes.
[01:45:59.589 --> 01:46:01.109]  With microcash, a penny at a time.
[01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:04.090]  But that's what millions of Americans who are news junkies are now doing.
[01:46:04.110 --> 01:46:07.431]  They go out and grab... I mean, I write articles that are 50 links.
[01:46:07.511 --> 01:46:15.933]  Every sentence is a link, documenting what we've said, and it's everybody else's information, but we're just collecting it and collating it.
[01:46:15.973 --> 01:46:18.853]  Well, the world brain is coming into effect.
[01:46:18.913 --> 01:46:20.534]  I think we're in about the fourth grade.
[01:46:21.054 --> 01:46:25.895]  The day is going to come when you can go to your computer and type in your zip code
[01:46:26.374 --> 01:46:33.521]  Select your issues that matter to you, education, water, health, whatever, and then print out a stoplight chart for who to vote for.
[01:46:35.583 --> 01:46:38.765]  Now I saw Google reporting on five years how they're going to have that.
[01:46:38.805 --> 01:46:48.975]  The problem is Google also says that they're going to use microphones with NSA keyword listening to show you advertising packages or to sell it to others.
[01:46:49.015 --> 01:46:50.096]  That's total surveillance.
[01:46:50.749 --> 01:47:01.338]  And they're also saying that they're going to tell you who the good politician is, but I don't necessarily believe the coalition that they're going to do, you know, claiming a politician is either pro-gun or anti-gun.
[01:47:01.678 --> 01:47:04.400]  Well, I think there will be cross-checking.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:11.586]  I agree with Eric Schmidt and Larry Page when they say that the answer to bad information is more information.
[01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:16.970]  I think Google has made a very important strategic mistake.
[01:47:17.538 --> 01:47:19.540]  In dealing with the secret elements of the U.S.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:19.940]  government.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.422]  That is a huge mistake.
[01:47:21.902 --> 01:47:28.648]  And I'm hoping they'll work their way out of it and basically cut that relationship off.
[01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:31.251]  Please continue.
[01:47:32.412 --> 01:47:42.701]  Well, you know, Google was a little hypocritical when they were refusing to honor a Department of Justice request for information because they were heavily in bed with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:47:43.226 --> 01:47:46.587]  The Office of Research and Development, my old friend Rick Steinhiser.
[01:47:48.008 --> 01:47:53.210]  Now, I think Google has to be purer than Caesar's wife.
[01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:59.752]  And I have no problem with their accepting some censorship from China and other places as the price of entry.
[01:48:00.239 --> 01:48:05.202]  But I do have a problem with their having a secret relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:48:05.302 --> 01:48:11.145]  Well, obviously they're getting a lot of their technology from NSA backbone type systems.
[01:48:11.226 --> 01:48:12.326]  No, don't believe that.
[01:48:12.606 --> 01:48:13.547]  Don't believe that at all.
[01:48:13.567 --> 01:48:14.267]  I'll tell you why.
[01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:17.709]  My friend Steve Arnold has written a wonderful book.
[01:48:17.769 --> 01:48:18.930]  It costs $200.
[01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:20.491]  It's called The Google Legacy.
[01:48:20.971 --> 01:48:22.892]  It's the best book on Google.
[01:48:24.293 --> 01:48:28.896]  And the bottom line is what Google has done is invented the low-cost supercomputer.
[01:48:29.488 --> 01:48:35.772]  They have gotten their data centers to the point where they can install an entire data center in 72 hours.
[01:48:36.312 --> 01:48:37.353]  It's plug and play.
[01:48:37.373 --> 01:48:43.156]  They've eliminated the configuration management and the backup issues and their price.
[01:48:44.082 --> 01:48:49.223]  For a rack is one-third of what IBM or Dell or anyone else would charge.
[01:48:49.363 --> 01:48:50.024]  No, I understand.
[01:48:50.064 --> 01:48:51.944]  In fact, we even know where those data centers are now.
[01:48:51.964 --> 01:48:52.564]  Oh, good for you!
[01:48:53.164 --> 01:49:02.887]  Well, no, I mean, I'm finding it interesting that, I mean, you're right, everybody else is paying, that's what my IT guy has discovered, is that everybody else is paying two-thirds more than Google is.
[01:49:03.127 --> 01:49:03.547]  That's right.
[01:49:03.727 --> 01:49:10.789]  We're trying to keep that out of a popular understanding, but the point I'm trying to get at here is I've had Google censor us,
[01:49:11.542 --> 01:49:14.164]  And they claim that it's an accident.
[01:49:14.784 --> 01:49:16.005]  They censor our news.
[01:49:16.065 --> 01:49:17.826]  They claim we're a news affiliate, but they censor it.
[01:49:18.207 --> 01:49:25.011]  We've caught them deleting our page views, our views for TerrorStorm, for instance, because they wanted out of the top 100.
[01:49:25.472 --> 01:49:26.852]  They keep claiming it's an accident.
[01:49:27.133 --> 01:49:28.374]  So they are being evil.
[01:49:28.434 --> 01:49:29.554]  They have started censoring.
[01:49:29.915 --> 01:49:34.097]  That's very interesting, because Larry Page, I actually know him.
[01:49:34.798 --> 01:49:37.300]  We go to a hackers conference together, and I respect him.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:40.642]  And one of the things he said is, do no harm.
[01:49:41.548 --> 01:49:47.210]  So, if Google is in fact starting to do harm, I think it's important that that be documented and publicized.
[01:49:47.730 --> 01:49:52.311]  Well, we've been trying to do that, and they admit, oh, we're accidentally erasing your views, but nobody else's.
[01:49:52.411 --> 01:49:53.251]  We'll be right back, sir.
[01:49:53.311 --> 01:49:59.933]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.253 --> 01:50:02.174]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.574 --> 01:50:10.176]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.908 --> 01:50:17.973]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.354 --> 01:50:29.762]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.102 --> 01:50:33.585]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.065 --> 01:50:35.967]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.327 --> 01:50:40.170]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:03.414 --> 01:51:05.896]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:51:06.296 --> 01:51:20.866]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:20.886 --> 01:51:21.207]  government.
[01:51:21.387 --> 01:51:23.188]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:51:23.548 --> 01:51:29.472]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:51:29.592 --> 01:51:34.095]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[01:51:34.355 --> 01:51:39.958]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:39.978 --> 01:51:41.819]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:41.839 --> 01:51:42.220]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.781]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:58.796]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.

[01:52:12.029 --> 01:52:12.509]  I think so.
[01:52:29.121 --> 01:52:29.441]  I think so.
[01:52:54.588 --> 01:52:57.329]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:57.349 --> 01:53:01.250]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.530 --> 01:53:04.710]  More on corruption.
[01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:07.071]  We're going to take a few calls for our guest.
[01:53:07.471 --> 01:53:12.412]  He's agreed to stay with us into the second segment with Webster Tarverly in the next hour.
[01:53:13.572 --> 01:53:15.573]  He is Robert David Steele.
[01:53:16.513 --> 01:53:19.854]  And you can go to Infowars.com and link through his bios, the book he just published.
[01:53:20.473 --> 01:53:28.858]  And some of the 770 books he's reviewed, the non-fiction he's reviewed, former Marine Corps Intelligence, then with the CIA, doing field cases and that's the stuff that matters.
[01:53:29.398 --> 01:53:31.840]  We're honored to have him with us today.
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:38.103]  Just briefly before we talk to Patrick in Michigan and a few others, back to Google and the CIA.
[01:53:38.143 --> 01:53:39.344]  I knew they were involved with them.
[01:53:39.704 --> 01:53:48.349]  I knew they'd moved into some old NASA offices and were interfacing and doing a lot of really creepy stuff and that's when we saw some of the changes start to begin.
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:52.063]  Also, we'll have a story that, say, a million people have read.
[01:53:52.604 --> 01:53:54.426]  And every other search engine has it posted.
[01:53:54.826 --> 01:54:00.493]  But Google won't have ours posted, but we'll have some little bitty blogs posted because their filter missed it.
[01:54:00.953 --> 01:54:02.896]  And we know Google is filtering us out.
[01:54:04.197 --> 01:54:06.680]  And they're doing it to other people now, kind of like
[01:54:07.361 --> 01:54:14.143]  Kind of like you can't link through now, or a lot of the audio won't play on MySpace, won't play YouTube or Google videos.
[01:54:14.163 --> 01:54:23.885]  And I noticed this weeks before, it was in the New York Post, with Rupert Murdoch fighting with Google and YouTube, now the same thing, saying you can't play your videos.
[01:54:24.225 --> 01:54:25.606]  So we know there's a lot of stuff.
[01:54:25.666 --> 01:54:27.206]  It's like Yahoo won't
[01:54:28.021 --> 01:54:31.582]  Allow a YouTube instant message, URL to be sent through.
[01:54:31.602 --> 01:54:33.342]  I mean, we know this stuff's going on, sir.
[01:54:33.502 --> 01:54:35.722]  I've caught them red-handed doing it to a bunch of people.
[01:54:36.342 --> 01:54:38.023]  Can you comment on their CIA connection?
[01:54:39.083 --> 01:54:39.343]  No.
[01:54:39.423 --> 01:54:41.383]  The only thing I know is that they do have one.
[01:54:42.704 --> 01:54:43.764]  And that is through who again?
[01:54:44.424 --> 01:54:46.504]  That is through the Office of Research and Development.
[01:54:47.985 --> 01:54:49.965]  And then that ties off into DARPA, doesn't it?
[01:54:50.365 --> 01:54:52.505]  Well, it's the CIA's equivalent of DARPA.
[01:54:52.545 --> 01:54:54.506]  Now, DARPA's doing some very good things.
[01:54:54.846 --> 01:54:55.586]  Strong Angel 3
[01:54:56.738 --> 01:55:04.424]  is a free open source software package that can be shared with state and local governments and with non-governmental organizations.
[01:55:04.544 --> 01:55:09.728]  And where I think we're going, and don't misunderstand me, I think Google is one of the greatest things since sliced bread.
[01:55:10.328 --> 01:55:18.774]  Google, the Googleplex, combined with, um, with, um, gosh, what's this, uh, software?
[01:55:19.455 --> 01:55:23.918]  Um, the Googleplex plus Strong Angel plus, um,
[01:55:24.505 --> 01:55:28.528]  There's now an open source software for language translation.
[01:55:29.469 --> 01:55:30.950]  Let me see if I can find it here.
[01:55:30.970 --> 01:55:32.811]  Babblefish.
[01:55:33.511 --> 01:55:33.932]  No.
[01:55:33.952 --> 01:55:35.393]  That's the old one.
[01:55:35.413 --> 01:55:35.453]  No.
[01:55:36.453 --> 01:55:37.074]  Here we go.
[01:55:37.754 --> 01:55:38.715]  It's TeleLanguage.
[01:55:39.255 --> 01:55:47.321]  TeleLanguage is a really fine company and it allows you to basically, if you have an employee that speaks a language, they can be logged on.
[01:55:47.801 --> 01:55:51.584]  And if anyone in your organization needs that language, they can pinch hit.
[01:55:52.108 --> 01:55:58.536]  And if they're too busy, or if it's not appropriate, it can default to a commercial translator in India or Indonesia or someplace else.
[01:55:58.556 --> 01:55:59.677]  Sure, so let me just stop you right there.
[01:55:59.697 --> 01:56:01.539]  Let's fast forward, though, ten years.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:06.746]  Technology now doubling every two, then it'll be every year, then every month, then every hour, then every second.
[01:56:07.186 --> 01:56:08.608]  I mean, this is exponential.
[01:56:09.608 --> 01:56:09.788]  I think?
[01:56:30.974 --> 01:56:38.298]  I almost see this like a type of nanotech in the cyber zone with the RFID now tracking real-world items.
[01:56:39.178 --> 01:56:40.839]  It's almost like the grey goo.
[01:56:40.879 --> 01:56:42.540]  Well, let me give you a few groups here.
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:49.963]  First off, I think the machine of choice is going to be the handheld cell phone connected to seeing glasses.
[01:56:50.583 --> 01:56:52.724]  So, like the glasses that you wear.
[01:56:52.784 --> 01:56:53.344]  I've worn them.
[01:56:53.364 --> 01:56:54.385]  They're absolutely amazing.
[01:56:54.405 --> 01:56:56.706]  It looks just like your PCs on your desk.
[01:56:58.073 --> 01:57:03.175]  I am a real believer in Alvin Toffler's Revolutionary Wealth, his latest book.
[01:57:03.615 --> 01:57:04.955]  I'm a real believer in C.K.
[01:57:05.055 --> 01:57:07.836]  Prahalad, who's written The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.
[01:57:08.356 --> 01:57:14.077]  I am absolutely persuaded that we can, it's a term I use, information peacekeeping.
[01:57:14.438 --> 01:57:18.599]  I'm absolutely persuaded that we can use information in order to
[01:57:20.569 --> 01:57:24.412]  We've basically established belief systems that lead to both wealth and peace.
[01:57:24.813 --> 01:57:27.715]  And we also, frankly, have to root out evil belief systems.
[01:57:28.236 --> 01:57:28.996]  And that includes... Well, stay there.
[01:57:29.016 --> 01:57:29.817]  We've got a break again.
[01:57:29.837 --> 01:57:30.638]  A hard break, sir.
[01:57:30.958 --> 01:57:31.438]  Stay with us.
[01:57:31.518 --> 01:57:32.639]  Your call is promptly coming up.
[01:57:34.361 --> 01:57:38.624]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:50.601]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.262 --> 01:57:52.324]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.025 --> 01:57:54.127]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.808 --> 01:57:55.549]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.363 --> 01:57:57.284]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.904 --> 01:58:01.567]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:06.231]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.371 --> 01:58:09.774]  He's scheduled in this hour.
[01:58:26.531 --> 01:58:27.572]  We talked to him this morning.
[01:58:28.212 --> 01:58:30.214]  He's coming to Austin for the Texas Book Festival.
[01:58:30.734 --> 01:58:36.458]  Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who's criticized the IMF and World Bank's policies.
[01:58:37.538 --> 01:58:39.920]  With huge guests like this, though, I really should never announce it.
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:42.622]  Every time I do announce a big globalist guest, it gets scanned.
[01:58:42.642 --> 01:58:43.382]  We'll see if we get him on.
[01:58:43.402 --> 01:58:44.163]  We're trying him right now.
[01:58:45.164 --> 01:58:49.026]  And he's also probably accustomed to radio interviews starting at five after.
[01:58:49.046 --> 01:58:50.807]  But we're working on getting him right now.
[01:58:51.608 --> 01:58:53.549]  And we'll also be taking your phones throughout this hour.
[01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:54.450]  We had Aaron Russo.
[01:58:55.613 --> 01:59:06.098]  on in the last hour and a half, an amazing individual, and we had a caller call in earlier who doesn't believe in the North American Union, who doesn't believe in any of this stuff, he just thinks we're making it all up.
[01:59:08.739 --> 01:59:17.244]  And I've learned about the North American Union for, I guess I learned of it about 13 years ago, and I just can't believe that now it's in effect, and people are in denial.
[01:59:18.524 --> 01:59:22.206]  They just cannot, they cannot interface with reality.
[01:59:23.968 --> 01:59:27.050]  They're in abject, willful denial.
[01:59:29.692 --> 01:59:52.987]  I remember back, oh I guess it was in 2002, in fact I have the article here, March 4, 2002, InfoWars.com, The World Bank and Secret Argentine Plan, transcript of Greg Pallast, journalist for BBC and observer in London, and you go through the transcript of the interview with Greg Pallast, going over what those documents meant,
[01:59:56.761 --> 02:00:02.446]  Well, I'll tell you two things.
[02:00:02.606 --> 02:00:07.050]  One, I spoke with the former Chief Economist, Joe Stiglitz, who was fired by the World Bank.
[02:00:07.150 --> 02:00:10.273]  So, I on BBC with The Guardian basically spent some time debriefing him.
[02:00:10.693 --> 02:00:16.478]  It was like one of the scenes out of a Mission Impossible, you know, where the guy comes over from the other side and you spend hours debriefing him.
[02:00:16.878 --> 02:00:19.540]  So, I got the inside of what was happening at the World Bank.
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:20.261]  In addition, he did
[02:00:21.068 --> 02:00:23.149]  Not brief me, but I got some other sources.
[02:00:23.690 --> 02:00:30.834]  He would not give me inside documents, but other people handed me a giant stash of secret documents from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
[02:00:32.235 --> 02:00:42.101]  And it goes on to say that, and so one of the things that is happening is that in fact, I was supposed to be on CNN with the head of the World Bank, Jim Wilkinson, it's now
[02:00:43.726 --> 02:00:44.407]  Paul Wolfowitz.
[02:00:44.427 --> 02:00:45.988]  I guess you could have Wolf in your name to be there.
[02:00:46.448 --> 02:00:49.070]  And he said he would not appear on CNN even if they put me on.
[02:00:49.611 --> 02:00:52.413]  And so CNN did the craziest thing and pulled me off.
[02:00:53.194 --> 02:00:54.875]  So now they're threatening total boycott.
[02:00:54.975 --> 02:00:55.616]  Yeah, right.
[02:00:56.176 --> 02:00:57.477]  So what we found was this.
[02:00:57.517 --> 02:01:10.588]  We found inside these documents that basically they required nations to sign secret agreements in which they agreed to sell off their key assets in which they agreed to take economic steps which are really devastating to the nations involved.
[02:01:10.608 --> 02:01:12.129]  And if they didn't agree to these steps
[02:01:13.078 --> 02:01:21.521]  There was an average for each nation that signed 100 to 11 items, 111 items that they are required to sign off on.
[02:01:21.561 --> 02:01:25.302]  If they didn't follow these steps, they would be cut off from all international borrowing.
[02:01:25.782 --> 02:01:28.123]  You can't borrow any money in the international marketplace.
[02:01:28.863 --> 02:01:31.184]  Now, no one could survive without borrowing.
[02:01:31.224 --> 02:01:38.247]  And he goes on in the next, what, 10 pages, or the transcript is even longer than that, to break down what these documents entail.
[02:01:38.267 --> 02:01:41.768]  He put a lot of them on BBC, but there was a news blackout with this.
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:44.541]  We've always wanted to get Joseph Stiglitz on the show.
[02:01:47.082 --> 02:01:48.423]  We're trying to get him on right now.
[02:01:48.443 --> 02:01:49.363]  Have you had any luck yet?
[02:01:51.204 --> 02:01:53.085]  Just rings and rings and rings and rings.
[02:01:54.145 --> 02:01:57.807]  Of course, more often than somebody just not coming on, more often we get our time zones scrambled.
[02:01:57.827 --> 02:02:05.851]  But I was at the office an hour before air time when Kevin Smith was on the phone with Stiglitz talking about the interview.
[02:02:06.991 --> 02:02:08.572]  So he was scheduled.
[02:02:09.693 --> 02:02:11.714]  We'll continue to try to get him on.
[02:02:11.754 --> 02:02:13.675]  If not, we'll have open phones in this third hour.
[02:02:14.335 --> 02:02:18.557]  Get into Bush's smoke and mirrors, so-called border fence, and a lot more.
[02:02:19.818 --> 02:02:29.323]  Right here on the GCN radio network, the websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, MarshallLaw911.info, ArnoldExposed.com,
[02:02:30.382 --> 02:02:34.586]  There's a bunch of others I didn't list, but the two big ones are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:02:34.927 --> 02:02:36.248]  Updated multiple times daily.
[02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:38.531]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:42.214]  Start going to your calls, and hopefully getting Joseph Stiglitz on.
[02:02:42.234 --> 02:02:42.695]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:54.242]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.642 --> 02:03:02.304]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.984 --> 02:03:10.027]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.427 --> 02:03:17.349]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:17.805 --> 02:03:21.847]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.147 --> 02:03:25.628]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.128 --> 02:03:28.049]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.389 --> 02:03:32.310]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:03:32.831 --> 02:03:40.593]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:03:45.569 --> 02:03:46.329]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.469 --> 02:03:47.229]  Terrorism!
[02:03:47.329 --> 02:03:53.391]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:53.651 --> 02:03:55.251]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:55.491 --> 02:03:57.952]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:58.352 --> 02:04:12.915]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:12.955 --> 02:04:13.276]  government.

[02:05:39.267 --> 02:05:41.807]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.927 --> 02:05:58.089]  We're trying to hook up with Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist, World Bank.
[02:05:58.109 --> 02:06:02.011]  He either got our time zone scrambled or I talked about it.
[02:06:02.031 --> 02:06:05.572]  Whenever I have a big guest in the past, I've learned to keep my mouth shut until they just suddenly appear.
[02:06:06.213 --> 02:06:07.693]  And I think if I would have done that, he'd been there.
[02:06:07.773 --> 02:06:11.935]  But a lot of times they find out who I am and freak out and don't come on.
[02:06:12.615 --> 02:06:13.916]  But we'll see what happens.
[02:06:14.176 --> 02:06:15.617]  If not, there's no telling.
[02:06:16.457 --> 02:06:19.979]  We get about 95% of the guests on that we do shut up, but we'll see.
[02:06:20.299 --> 02:06:22.920]  It's always best when I'm setting them up just to give them no information.
[02:06:23.849 --> 02:06:26.594]  But we try our best to do that without being dishonest with people.
[02:06:27.756 --> 02:06:29.558]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[02:06:33.723 --> 02:06:36.524]  He's calling in about some manual about voting or something.
[02:06:36.544 --> 02:06:37.424]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:06:37.885 --> 02:06:42.266]  Yeah, I've got the manual right in front of me, and it has procedures for everything.
[02:06:42.286 --> 02:06:43.947]  Okay, what manual?
[02:06:44.007 --> 02:06:45.367]  Whose manual?
[02:06:45.447 --> 02:06:46.308]  State of Wisconsin.
[02:06:46.368 --> 02:06:51.330]  It's pretty much state standardized, but for each city it'll be a little different.
[02:06:51.510 --> 02:07:00.013]  But for people that can take time off on Tuesday, our polls are going to be open from 7 until 8 o'clock.
[02:07:00.353 --> 02:07:00.773]  I understand.
[02:07:00.853 --> 02:07:01.733]  What does the manual do?
[02:07:01.753 --> 02:07:02.114]  Just tell us.
[02:07:03.823 --> 02:07:08.266]  It's the Election Commission Poll Worker Training Manual for this year.
[02:07:08.626 --> 02:07:10.628]  It's have a certifier or whatever.
[02:07:10.828 --> 02:07:11.929]  So we've got those.
[02:07:12.049 --> 02:07:15.931]  But poll workers have no control over the wireless connections and hookups.
[02:07:16.192 --> 02:07:18.033]  Actually, we don't have those kind of machines.
[02:07:18.073 --> 02:07:19.654]  We just have the Scantron ones.
[02:07:19.854 --> 02:07:21.335]  We still have the paper ballots.
[02:07:21.375 --> 02:07:25.418]  Because they're just as bad, you feed them in and it's then put on a computer that can be manipulated.
[02:07:25.965 --> 02:07:35.093]  Well, the thing is, if anybody wants a recount, we've got those ballots on hand, but they have to refeed, because we are... You refeed them with the same county clerk stealing the election.
[02:07:35.634 --> 02:07:39.837]  Well, that's why we also have the observers.
[02:07:40.097 --> 02:07:43.901]  And if somebody wants to be an observer, they cannot keep you out.
[02:07:44.321 --> 02:07:51.628]  Now, if you have like 20 or 30 of them, that's why it's good to become an observer early on, so that they don't say, well, we've already got 20 people, sorry.
[02:07:52.792 --> 02:07:55.193]  So you have to document everything.
[02:07:55.313 --> 02:07:58.515]  If you read through the manual, it'll say step-by-step.
[02:07:58.615 --> 02:08:06.538]  And if somebody goes beyond that, if they add something they're not supposed to, if they take something out that they're not supposed to, make sure you catch it on tape.
[02:08:06.978 --> 02:08:11.600]  And you can demand to have a police officer come and arrest them for election fraud.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:13.461]  Or at least give them a warning.
[02:08:13.621 --> 02:08:15.402]  Look, you know, you've been caught doing this.
[02:08:15.522 --> 02:08:15.742]  Don't.
[02:08:16.511 --> 02:08:23.313]  And it'll look horrible on the news for anybody if somebody sees ballots going someplace they're not supposed to.
[02:08:23.353 --> 02:08:25.894]  I mean, this is just to protect your rights.
[02:08:26.554 --> 02:08:27.914]  And if you don't... Sure.
[02:08:27.974 --> 02:08:29.415]  Well, I mean, and I appreciate your call.
[02:08:29.475 --> 02:08:33.116]  People should get involved in the election process to see it for themselves.
[02:08:33.136 --> 02:08:35.476]  I volunteered in, what was it?
[02:08:35.496 --> 02:08:35.576]  1998 and 1988.
[02:08:35.716 --> 02:08:36.176]  And I was there.
[02:08:43.238 --> 02:09:03.370]  And I saw in the Republican primary, it was at the Austin Convention Center, I saw cases, I mean I was there stacking the Scantrons to make sure they were being stacked correctly or in the right order, facing the right direction, and then be fed into the automated readers.
[02:09:03.951 --> 02:09:09.354]  It looked just like a college or high school exam system, you know, A, B, or C, or whatever.
[02:09:10.089 --> 02:09:11.689]  And then it's fed to her and read by a computer.
[02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:13.430]  Optical scanners, the proper term.
[02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:15.130]  And then put into a computer.
[02:09:15.710 --> 02:09:18.231]  And I mean, Pat Buchanan had more than half.
[02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:26.573]  I mean, it was, because I have to admit, I was stacking them, I was looking, I was asking other people, I was saying, what are you seeing, Pat Buchanan?
[02:09:27.573 --> 02:09:31.774]  And you're sitting there, and then I'd take them and cram them in the machine.
[02:09:32.594 --> 02:09:35.975]  And then it came out that night, he got 8% of the vote in Travis County.
[02:09:37.173 --> 02:09:39.894]  And then they caught him in Arizona and other places where he'd really won.
[02:09:39.934 --> 02:09:40.695]  They stole it from him.
[02:09:41.135 --> 02:09:43.956]  I mean, Pat Buchanan won the Republican primary.
[02:09:43.996 --> 02:09:53.560]  He should have been the Republican candidate running against Bill Clinton, not the corpse they ran Bob Dole, the consulate insider.
[02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:55.761]  And that didn't happen.
[02:09:57.281 --> 02:10:00.783]  It was all over the country they stole it from Pat Buchanan because he has the popular ideas.
[02:10:01.643 --> 02:10:02.324]  He's a populist.
[02:10:02.344 --> 02:10:03.244]  He's what the people want.
[02:10:04.508 --> 02:10:09.492]  And he's predominantly anti-war, anti-Federal Reserve, anti-open borders, anti-globalist.
[02:10:10.132 --> 02:10:11.353]  He's what Republicans want.
[02:10:11.373 --> 02:10:12.694]  They don't want Bob Dole.
[02:10:13.214 --> 02:10:14.595]  So it's been going on forever.
[02:10:16.937 --> 02:10:18.598]  And I'm told we've got another number for Stiglitz.
[02:10:18.618 --> 02:10:19.398]  Did you have any luck?
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:22.581]  You're getting him right now.
[02:10:22.601 --> 02:10:23.722]  He told me that a few minutes ago.
[02:10:24.482 --> 02:10:25.062]  I'm sitting here.
[02:10:25.783 --> 02:10:26.363]  Salivating.
[02:10:27.844 --> 02:10:28.565]  Well, we have him.
[02:10:28.705 --> 02:10:29.946]  Well, better late than never.
[02:10:29.986 --> 02:10:31.387]  We're so honored to have him.
[02:10:32.259 --> 02:10:33.120]  Well, it's great to be here.
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:33.820]  Sorry about the confusion.
[02:11:00.965 --> 02:11:02.366]  Well, that happens sometimes.
[02:11:02.386 --> 02:11:03.507]  It's probably on our end.
[02:11:03.967 --> 02:11:06.329]  Just in a nutshell, sir, tell us about yourself.
[02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:08.691]  Well, I'm an economist.
[02:11:10.712 --> 02:11:18.478]  My theoretical work, for which I got the Nobel Prize, was called The Economics of Asymmetric Information, or Imperfect Information.
[02:11:18.498 --> 02:11:26.023]  It's about how markets work when some people know more than others, which is the case in all markets.
[02:11:26.818 --> 02:11:44.885]  And what was so remarkable is that for 200 years, economic theory had been developed on the assumption of perfect information, and it was just hoped that a world with imperfect information would be almost like a world with perfect information, and I showed that that was obviously not the case.
[02:11:45.885 --> 02:11:53.728]  But then the other thing I did is I was asked by President Clinton to serve on his Council of Economic Advisors, and eventually
[02:11:54.284 --> 02:12:03.789]  I served as the chairman of the council, which is his chief economic advisor for economic policy and a whole range of issues I dealt with.
[02:12:04.549 --> 02:12:23.338]  And then after leaving that, in 1997, I went on to work at the World Bank as their chief economist and senior vice president, which is where I got really very deeply involved in the issues of globalization, which I wrote about in my book, Globalization is Discontent, in my more recent book, Making Globalization Work.
[02:12:24.328 --> 02:12:38.318]  And rather than get into complex theorems and the unified theory of economics and all of that, because even for myself it's hard to understand, but for our general listening audience, some probably know as much as you do, but most probably don't have even an idea.
[02:12:38.618 --> 02:12:46.423]  Can you boil down why you left the World Bank, why you were critical, your term coining the IMF riot?
[02:12:46.503 --> 02:12:51.346]  What's wrong with the way that the global system is being administered?
[02:12:51.526 --> 02:12:53.848]  Can you crystallize it in maybe a two-minute statement?
[02:12:54.948 --> 02:13:14.716]  Well, the most important thesis that I bring out in my new book is that we've become more economically integrated, more interdependent, more dependent on each other, but we don't have the political institutions that can help us address the needs that we have to act cooperatively.
[02:13:15.336 --> 02:13:20.278]  We have to act cooperatively as we are one integrated world, world economy.
[02:13:21.111 --> 02:13:26.275]  And the result of that is that, quite often, there are big losers.
[02:13:26.675 --> 02:13:28.837]  And we haven't paid enough attention to those losers.
[02:13:30.098 --> 02:13:34.721]  Aren't we really, Dr. Stiglitz, aren't we really seeing modern neo-mercantilism?
[02:13:36.102 --> 02:13:39.024]  Well, we are seeing it in many places around the world.
[02:13:39.084 --> 02:13:41.526]  We talk a lot about exports.
[02:13:42.486 --> 02:13:44.047]  We want to promote our exports.
[02:13:45.348 --> 02:13:48.010]  We don't think about it from a systemic point of view.
[02:13:48.290 --> 02:13:50.292]  Our exports are some other country's imports.
[02:13:50.802 --> 02:13:57.264]  So if every country just promotes exports, then of course the whole trading system doesn't work.
[02:13:57.504 --> 02:13:57.964]  Sure, sure.
[02:13:58.004 --> 02:14:04.526]  I know you're not here to dish dirt, but you did back in 2002 when you left as their chief economist at the World Bank.
[02:14:04.646 --> 02:14:08.907]  What was your major... I mean, I have the transcripts here and things you've written, but in your words,
[02:14:10.647 --> 02:14:12.107]  Why did you leave the World Bank?
[02:14:12.147 --> 02:14:13.888]  What do you think they're doing that's wrong?
[02:14:13.908 --> 02:14:30.151]  I mean, the predatory practices, the IMF World Bank documents that came out shortly after you left in the BBC, your meeting with Greg Pallas, where, you know, it's this predatory system of going in and blowing out economies so global financial corporations can come in and just take over.
[02:14:30.771 --> 02:14:31.911]  Yeah, that's one way of putting it.
[02:14:33.651 --> 02:14:37.852]  The more fundamental thing was that the whole system was rigged against the poor countries.
[02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:46.015]  ...rigged for the advanced industrial countries, and that the result of that is that there were an awful lot of losers.
[02:14:46.035 --> 02:14:57.583]  To give you one example, the last round of trade agreements was so unfair that the poorest countries of the world were actually left worse off.
[02:14:58.224 --> 02:15:08.031]  So that while the advanced industrial countries, the big multinational corporations came out as big winners, there were unfortunately a lot of people who were losers.
[02:15:10.496 --> 02:15:31.409]  But the documents that were released, I mean the premeditated nature of this, who are the players that are behind, you know, not just rigging it where the industrialized corporations that control the industrialized first world systems, I mean really it's a type of weight, you know, the IMF riot, bringing in conditions that cause even greater collapses for greater consolidation.
[02:15:32.169 --> 02:15:32.730]  Well that's right.
[02:15:35.566 --> 02:15:40.208]  Part of the problem is they had an agenda that they talked about called privatization and liberalization.
[02:15:40.268 --> 02:15:54.715]  Privatization meant selling off government assets, assets that had been invested in over decades to foreign companies, often at a fraction of their true market value.
[02:15:55.255 --> 02:16:00.917]  So while the citizens of the country had worked hard, saved, invested that money over a period of 20-30 years,
[02:16:02.822 --> 02:16:11.004]  When they sold the assets, the citizens of that country got almost nothing for those assets.
[02:16:11.764 --> 02:16:15.645]  Other cases where water is a basic necessity of life.
[02:16:16.765 --> 02:16:18.565]  They would triple it in a week, as you wrote.
[02:16:19.165 --> 02:16:26.227]  I mean, the private corporation pays off the politician, basically, pays off the government, and then seizes the infrastructure and then jacks up prices.
[02:16:26.607 --> 02:16:27.087]  That's right.
[02:16:27.107 --> 02:16:31.908]  I mean, what happened with many of these cases, they had privatization before regulation.
[02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:43.652]  At least we understand that if you're going to have a natural monopoly, a company running electricity, selling electricity, if you have only one company doing it, you need to regulate it.
[02:16:44.152 --> 02:16:51.254]  And what happened, IMF didn't understand what we do here in the United States and what every other advanced industrial country does.
[02:16:51.974 --> 02:16:55.615]  If you're going to have a monopoly, you have to make sure that it doesn't overcharge.
[02:16:56.255 --> 02:17:00.056]  So they privatized these government enterprises, didn't put in the regulation,
[02:17:00.586 --> 02:17:04.788]  And sometimes the result of that is that the prices increased enormously.
[02:17:05.048 --> 02:17:12.232]  And then the predatory nature was so great it would even debase the economy to the point of where the privatization went belly up.
[02:17:12.252 --> 02:17:20.036]  There were many cases of that kind, but the example in Mexico next door, they privatized the roads.
[02:17:20.666 --> 02:17:28.068]  And then, of course, they weren't able to maintain those roads, and the government had to, again, take over the roads after the company had collapsed.
[02:17:28.128 --> 02:17:30.449]  Joseph Stiklitz, former Chief Economist, World Bank.
[02:17:30.489 --> 02:17:31.609]  Incredible information.
[02:17:31.689 --> 02:17:32.229]  Quick break.
[02:17:32.529 --> 02:17:33.690]  You brought us into roads.
[02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:35.650]  That was the next question I had.
[02:17:36.050 --> 02:17:37.071]  We're on the same page.
[02:17:37.091 --> 02:17:38.011]  Please stay with us.
[02:17:38.051 --> 02:17:39.371]  You're very gracious to join us.
[02:17:47.839 --> 02:17:51.380]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:52.581 --> 02:17:57.402]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:57.602 --> 02:18:00.343]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:00.383 --> 02:18:01.523]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:02.844 --> 02:18:07.445]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:08.366 --> 02:18:15.568]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[02:18:49.168 --> 02:18:52.070]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:57.755]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:18:58.736 --> 02:19:03.680]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:19:04.761 --> 02:19:06.563]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:19:06.963 --> 02:19:07.744]  There may be more.
[02:19:08.906 --> 02:19:15.710]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?

[02:20:59.138 --> 02:21:01.259]  The poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:21:52.816 --> 02:21:54.697]  Here to build the big guns.
[02:21:57.162 --> 02:21:57.822]  Welcome back!
[02:21:57.842 --> 02:22:06.146]  Dr. Joseph Stiglitz is our guest.
[02:22:06.186 --> 02:22:10.327]  He's got a new book out.
[02:22:10.347 --> 02:22:16.870]  We'll tell you about it before he leaves us.
[02:22:16.890 --> 02:22:21.312]  He'll be here with us for about 40-45 after or so.
[02:22:27.601 --> 02:22:29.322]  And we are honored to have him again.
[02:22:29.342 --> 02:22:30.803]  You mentioned roads.
[02:22:30.823 --> 02:22:34.066]  You were telling a story about Mexico, quote, privatizing roads.
[02:22:34.106 --> 02:22:34.986]  Please continue, Doctor.
[02:22:35.327 --> 02:22:37.948]  Well, the point was a very simple one.
[02:22:38.229 --> 02:22:45.674]  They sold the roads to the private enterprise, and the hope was that they would be more efficient.
[02:22:46.654 --> 02:22:48.376]  Of course, what happens is that
[02:22:49.755 --> 02:22:57.742]  They didn't maintain the roads, they couldn't generate enough revenue, and they eventually added default and put the roads back to the government.
[02:22:58.242 --> 02:22:59.984]  There have been lots of other examples.
[02:23:00.124 --> 02:23:01.745]  Mexico has provided a number.
[02:23:01.886 --> 02:23:06.690]  One of the more disastrous was they privatized the banks.
[02:23:08.111 --> 02:23:10.313]  And the argument again was that they would be more efficient.
[02:23:11.393 --> 02:23:13.115]  In many cases, that happens.
[02:23:13.155 --> 02:23:15.497]  But in the case of Mexico, the way they privatized
[02:23:16.158 --> 02:23:17.460]  Let's do it!
[02:23:35.228 --> 02:23:37.670]  It's really one of the greatest robberies that have ever occurred.
[02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:40.612]  Exactly, and that was well publicized.
[02:23:40.692 --> 02:23:43.254]  Now, speaking of roads, I was going to bring that up, but not in Mexico.
[02:23:43.634 --> 02:23:54.301]  Here, the Spanish company Centrum does sweetheart deals, and they've done the calculations even mainstream news has, for about 5% of the true value of existing roads, they're being ceded them
[02:23:54.981 --> 02:24:16.795]  But we're talking existing major arteries, and being given them to put transponders in the cars, taxes at exorbitant levels, to fund a lot of North American Union projects, some of the government funding goes into that, the new SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership, that's come out, and so I'm now seeing the same IMF World Bank vultures coming into the industrialized world.
[02:24:16.815 --> 02:24:17.496]  Can you speak to that?
[02:24:18.176 --> 02:24:24.300]  Well, this is a movement that's gone all over the world, a movement trying to turn over
[02:24:26.089 --> 02:24:31.531]  Basic facilities, water, roads, to the private sector.
[02:24:33.491 --> 02:24:39.633]  The reason for, in part, the good reason is that exposably more efficient often turns out not to be the case.
[02:24:39.713 --> 02:24:45.575]  The bad reason, which is really driving it, is that the governments today don't have to pay the budget constraints.
[02:24:45.595 --> 02:24:47.095]  They get a little bit of money up front.
[02:24:48.137 --> 02:24:52.818]  But then the problems are left to future administrations.
[02:24:53.098 --> 02:24:59.960]  Isn't it also that 70 plus percent of the stock market ownership is by institutional purchasers in government?
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:11.623]  I don't know the exact numbers, but increasingly a large fraction of our stock is owned by, it's by our pension funds, institutions of that kind.
[02:25:12.611 --> 02:25:18.302]  Well, I looked at the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for Texas a few years ago, and the lion's share was owned by companies.
[02:25:18.542 --> 02:25:20.406]  I mean, not companies, but by government.
[02:25:21.768 --> 02:25:23.049]  It could be.
[02:25:23.129 --> 02:25:23.569]  I don't know.
[02:25:23.589 --> 02:25:25.570]  I haven't looked at that particular set of data.
[02:25:25.931 --> 02:25:28.852]  Yeah, it's such a huge field in economics, I understand.
[02:25:29.573 --> 02:25:31.053]  But can you speak directly to this?
[02:25:31.113 --> 02:25:42.840]  So you agree there is a massive move now, not just in the third world, with this so-called privatization that I call hijacking and looting, but now in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Canada.
[02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:44.061]  Yeah, it is.
[02:25:45.071 --> 02:25:54.657]  Some of the failures have put a dampener on this movement, and in the UK they privatized the railroads, and everybody today recognizes what a failure that has been.
[02:25:54.737 --> 02:26:08.665]  The railroads weren't maintained, the roadbeds weren't maintained, there were a number of accidents, people were killed, and so that a number of people are, on the basis of that experience, are rethinking this policy of privatization.
[02:26:08.985 --> 02:26:11.026]  What has caused predatory globalization?
[02:26:12.702 --> 02:26:15.224]  What has caused it to shift into such a predatory stance?
[02:26:15.964 --> 02:26:22.989]  Well, I think, of course, everybody's always wanted to take advantage of others to the extent that they could.
[02:26:23.549 --> 02:26:36.898]  I think the fundamental difference is a free market ideology that is being used, or more accurately, abused by those who have seen how to take advantage of that rhetoric.
[02:26:36.958 --> 02:26:39.120]  So, it sounds good to say
[02:26:39.853 --> 02:26:43.135]  Well, private enterprises are more efficient than government.
[02:26:43.695 --> 02:26:45.737]  But take the Social Security Administration.
[02:26:45.997 --> 02:26:51.760]  A couple years ago, there was an attempt to try to privatize Social Security.
[02:26:52.381 --> 02:27:04.908]  The fact is, the Social Security Administration is more efficient than any private insurance company, because they don't have to spend all the money on advertising and trying to cream skim to figure out who's the best risk, who's the worst risk.
[02:27:05.909 --> 02:27:08.530]  In the UK, they did privatize the
[02:27:09.904 --> 02:27:13.205]  Social Security system and at least part of it.
[02:27:13.445 --> 02:27:17.805]  And the result of that was that benefits were reduced 40% because of transaction costs.
[02:27:18.045 --> 02:27:20.706]  Dr. Stiglitz, final segment with you on the other side.
[02:27:20.746 --> 02:27:22.086]  We'll be back in just three minutes.
[02:27:22.586 --> 02:27:23.226]  Stay with us.
[02:27:23.246 --> 02:27:24.086]  This is GCN Radio.
[02:27:36.068 --> 02:27:36.989]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.469 --> 02:27:38.969]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.984 --> 02:27:42.768]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.973 --> 02:27:51.038]  Hey, want to know a natural healing treatment that's been around for thousands of years?

[02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:14.733]  Bath salts release toxins as they soften and rehydrate the skin.
[02:28:15.113 --> 02:28:18.937]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.
[02:28:19.417 --> 02:28:21.819]  So many different self products available for you.
[02:28:22.139 --> 02:28:23.641]  It's time to let the secret out.

[02:28:45.911 --> 02:28:51.137]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:51.297 --> 02:28:59.386]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.646 --> 02:29:06.694]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:06.834 --> 02:29:07.474]  We're good to go!
[02:29:34.113 --> 02:29:34.514]  I think?
[02:29:46.198 --> 02:29:48.620]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:52.442]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:29:52.822 --> 02:29:55.764]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:29:56.044 --> 02:30:02.408]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:30:02.488 --> 02:30:06.891]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:11.493]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:30:11.653 --> 02:30:14.254]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[02:30:14.274 --> 02:30:17.035]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:30:17.515 --> 02:30:20.036]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:30:20.096 --> 02:30:24.338]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:30:24.398 --> 02:30:25.238]  Treasury bonds.
[02:30:25.518 --> 02:30:30.162]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:30:30.322 --> 02:30:31.963]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:31.983 --> 02:30:33.965]  That's 1-888-XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:30:50.814 --> 02:30:52.736]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.197 --> 02:30:56.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.582 --> 02:31:00.045]  Alright, I got three or four final questions for Joseph Stiglitz.
[02:31:00.065 --> 02:31:01.187]  We'll also tell you about his new book.
[02:31:01.227 --> 02:31:02.448]  He's coming to Austin this weekend.
[02:31:02.468 --> 02:31:04.811]  You can come hear him speak at the Texas Book Festival.
[02:31:06.233 --> 02:31:08.676]  And we're coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas.
[02:31:10.450 --> 02:31:13.473]  The websites are Infowars.com and JonesReport.com.
[02:31:13.973 --> 02:31:19.779]  Dr. Joseph E. Stiglitz, of course, has written Globalization and its Disconnects, a new book is out, Making Globalization Work.
[02:31:20.199 --> 02:31:23.202]  He was the Chief Economist at the World Bank and the Vice President of the World Bank.
[02:31:23.842 --> 02:31:34.492]  What do you think of the difference between the last head, Wolfdenson, and the new head that we see here from the United States, Paul Wolfowitz?
[02:31:38.760 --> 02:32:05.345]  I worked with Wilkinson very closely, and we tried to actually redirect the World Bank to focus more on poor people, reduce poverty, a comprehensive approach to development, to try to cut back a little bit on the privatization, the liberalization, what was called the Washington Consensus, the consensus between the World Bank and the IMF and the U.S.
[02:32:05.365 --> 02:32:05.725]  Treasury.
[02:32:06.337 --> 02:32:15.244]  About how to run development, but actually an agenda that really failed almost everywhere that it tried.
[02:32:15.824 --> 02:32:17.545]  So that was what we were trying.
[02:32:17.565 --> 02:32:31.195]  The current administration has not, Wolfowitz has unfortunately not really been able to put together a comprehensive approach to development.
[02:32:31.676 --> 02:32:33.457]  It's only emphasized corruption.
[02:32:34.176 --> 02:32:37.319]  But it hasn't even put forward a kind of agenda for dealing with corruption.
[02:32:37.359 --> 02:32:41.302]  For instance, there are these secret bank accounts.
[02:32:42.383 --> 02:32:51.912]  There was an agreement among advanced industrial countries to do something about the secret bank accounts that play such an important role in facilitating corruption.
[02:32:52.332 --> 02:32:55.575]  But the Bush administration vetoed that.
[02:32:56.536 --> 02:32:57.176]  In August of 2001,
[02:32:58.757 --> 02:33:07.360]  Of course, in September 2001, we realized that these secret bank accounts not only facilitate corruption, they also facilitate terrorism.
[02:33:08.060 --> 02:33:17.243]  But the focus was on increasing the profits of those who engage in tax evasion, all those who use these kinds of bank accounts for nefarious purposes.
[02:33:18.693 --> 02:33:24.198]  But that would take a global authority to do that, so I think on the surface, it sounds good, but that would be dangerous.
[02:33:24.378 --> 02:33:28.081]  But then it does show that Bush doesn't want to stop all of these other secret bank accounts.
[02:33:28.342 --> 02:33:33.726]  What do you think about things like John Perkins' Confessions of an Economic Hitman?
[02:33:33.746 --> 02:33:34.387]  Have you read that book?
[02:33:35.248 --> 02:33:36.209]  I haven't read all of it.
[02:33:36.529 --> 02:33:42.354]  I mean, what he's raising, the basic point that he's raising is that a lot of the aid
[02:33:45.586 --> 02:33:46.707]  Do what you're supposed to do.
[02:33:47.067 --> 02:33:52.630]  Much of it seems to be motivated by the interest of contractors.
[02:33:53.810 --> 02:33:56.972]  And I think, unfortunately, there's a certain element of truth in that.
[02:33:56.992 --> 02:34:00.594]  There's an overtone in this book, a little bit of a conspiracy.
[02:34:00.614 --> 02:34:02.715]  I'm not sure it's as conspiratorial.
[02:34:03.271 --> 02:34:06.033]  The effects are much the same as if they were a conspiracy.
[02:34:06.333 --> 02:34:16.301]  And the effects are, we've got super powerful global corporations basically buying off even Western governments and using the IMF and World Bank monies to basically go in and blow out economies and buy them up.
[02:34:17.301 --> 02:34:27.349]  In fact, that was one of my main criticisms, that they push these policies called capital market liberalization that let money, speculative money, come in, come out.
[02:34:27.949 --> 02:34:31.552]  You can't build factories of money that can come in and out overnight, but what you can do
[02:34:32.116 --> 02:34:34.998]  That kind of volatility destroyed the economy.
[02:34:36.146 --> 02:34:43.392]  The financial markets made money when the money was coming in, then they made money when they had to restructure the devastation that they left behind.
[02:34:43.552 --> 02:34:45.093]  What about the North American Union?
[02:34:45.314 --> 02:35:02.027]  They've signed it, it's officially now being set up, the Asian Union's been officially announced, but it seems like it's the same corporations that are in there writing up all of the basic laws and tenets of these new global structures, and the people, by and large, aren't even aware of it.
[02:35:02.407 --> 02:35:03.788]  Well, I think that is a problem.
[02:35:04.468 --> 02:35:07.831]  And part of the thing is, there's something called the North American Pre-Trade Agreement.
[02:35:08.331 --> 02:35:11.133]  If it were a real pre-trade agreement, it would just be a couple pages.
[02:35:11.193 --> 02:35:12.974]  We eliminate our tariffs, they eliminate theirs.
[02:35:13.054 --> 02:35:16.597]  We eliminate our non-tariff subsidy and our subsidies, they eliminate theirs.
[02:35:17.137 --> 02:35:19.979]  But these agreements are thousands of pages.
[02:35:20.059 --> 02:35:21.640]  And of course no citizen can read that.
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:32.007]  Dr. Stiglitz, I mean, whenever we hear North American Union or any of this, this is really just powerful interest groups getting together, rewriting the laws under a new framework that suits them.
[02:35:32.802 --> 02:35:45.774]  Well, I think one of my concerns that I raise is that there is not the kind of democratic accountability and transparency that we've come to demand within our own governments.
[02:35:45.814 --> 02:35:46.815]  We don't always get it.
[02:35:47.495 --> 02:35:54.101]  But these international institutions, for instance, don't have a Freedom of Information Act.
[02:35:54.582 --> 02:35:58.946]  Some of the basic protections that we put in place, transparency,
[02:35:59.423 --> 02:36:02.406]  To make sure that citizens can know what is going on.
[02:36:02.466 --> 02:36:05.008]  And that's one of the points that I emphasize very strongly.
[02:36:06.249 --> 02:36:10.854]  Both in my old book, Globalization is Discontent, and in my new book, Making Globalization Work.
[02:36:10.974 --> 02:36:14.177]  Let me ask you, I've got two final questions and I want to plug the book and let you get out of here.
[02:36:15.541 --> 02:36:16.302]  Global government.
[02:36:16.362 --> 02:36:27.889]  I mean, it's here, it's being set up, the three unions are being slowly merged together, but still the mainstream media will call that a conspiracy theory when all the official documents say that this is really being set up.
[02:36:28.549 --> 02:36:36.414]  Number one, I mean, what do you say about global government, or how it's forming, and why do you think there's so much denial by people that it's happening?
[02:36:36.874 --> 02:36:44.979]  Well, I mean, first, the fact that we are economically interdependent does mean that we have to undertake certain actions together.
[02:36:45.798 --> 02:36:46.018]  I don't
[02:37:06.895 --> 02:37:22.815]  Specific agreement only, that doesn't run in the whole world, it just says you can't produce those ozone-destroying gases that lead into... But if you've got a global authority that knocks out secret bank accounts, and then of course that global power can selectively do that, that is the ultimate tenet of global government.
[02:37:24.236 --> 02:37:30.078]  What you need is just very limited regulations that restrict certain kinds of bad behavior.
[02:37:30.118 --> 02:37:31.238]  But then that's unified.
[02:37:32.078 --> 02:37:33.699]  Doctor, that's unified regulations.
[02:37:33.799 --> 02:37:34.899]  Well, no, they're not.
[02:37:34.979 --> 02:37:35.820]  They're just minimal.
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.020]  Let me give you an example.
[02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:50.224]  I used to see these old cowboy movies when we were growing up, and there would be different states, and the bandit would always ride on his horse across the state line, and the sheriff couldn't stop him.
[02:37:50.822 --> 02:38:00.526]  Well, if you're going to have safe havens for criminals going across state lines, it's not going to be good for our global economic system.
[02:38:01.067 --> 02:38:11.871]  So unfortunately, whether you like it or not, we have become interdependent, and that means you have to address some of these problems that go across the borders.
[02:38:11.891 --> 02:38:12.252]  Sure, sure.
[02:38:12.372 --> 02:38:15.013]  You've got to go in a minute, but what I'm trying to say is this.
[02:38:15.854 --> 02:38:44.177]  It's all the mechanisms, the apparatus of the IMF, World Bank, Ex-Im Bank, World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, NATO, you know, all of these are controlled by the same institutions, all the same money powers, and they're all causing the major problems, and then they always have a good cop, and I don't doubt you're probably a nice person, very intelligent, a good cop who comes out and says, oh, we need a loving, you know, global framework, and a good one, and you know,
[02:38:45.058 --> 02:38:58.707]  So, we're given the false choice of a loving global government, or an evil, nasty, fascistic, George Bushian global government, and at the end of the day, those of us that don't want interdependence, those of us that want to be sovereign, I don't think globalization's been good for the U.S.
[02:38:58.727 --> 02:39:03.990]  We've gone from the powerhouse to the, you know, to the uh... crap house, excuse me.
[02:39:04.010 --> 02:39:05.631]  I mean, it's destroying us.
[02:39:06.531 --> 02:39:09.513]  Well, in fact, I think, you know, if we hadn't
[02:39:11.232 --> 02:39:11.512]  Thank you.
[02:39:33.462 --> 02:39:36.646]  We're borrowing $3 billion from countries elsewhere.
[02:39:36.906 --> 02:39:43.093]  But I don't think it's a mistake that he gives these corporations, they're always left with the bag, the taxpayers pick up the tab.
[02:39:43.373 --> 02:39:54.385]  Well, I think that's right, and that's why we need more transparency, we need to have more accountability of what our government is doing, we need to know more about what it is doing.
[02:39:54.918 --> 02:39:59.441]  But that won't be resolved if we walk away from globalization.
[02:39:59.461 --> 02:40:07.366]  Well, I mean, regardless, the leaders of globalization, the people, the prime movers, they're always grab the money and run, and it's just a revolving door, and it just keeps, it keeps happening.
[02:40:07.446 --> 02:40:14.010]  I say, you know, go back to, you know, the way it was previous, or the Bretton Woods Agreement, you know, get back, I mean, look at what's happening to the dollar.
[02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:17.552]  In fact, let me ask you, where do you think the dollar's going, the debt bubble, the real estate market?
[02:40:17.893 --> 02:40:18.113]  Down.
[02:40:19.714 --> 02:40:26.338]  I mean, I saw the Financial Times of London, what, three months ago, saying that the elite is saying we've got to position our money to survive during a crash.
[02:40:26.518 --> 02:40:28.139]  They're not even saying they can pull us out of it.
[02:40:28.339 --> 02:40:30.921]  Now there's only a discussion of them surviving the crash landing.
[02:40:31.421 --> 02:40:33.342]  Well, I am increasingly worried.
[02:40:33.362 --> 02:40:34.823]  I've been worried about this for some time.
[02:40:34.843 --> 02:40:38.565]  The real estate prices last month, new real estate, went down 10%.
[02:40:40.246 --> 02:40:43.968]  So do you see a huge correction, global recession or depression?
[02:40:45.089 --> 02:40:48.831]  I see a correction, and if it's well managed.
[02:40:49.326 --> 02:40:50.727]  It will only be a slowdown.
[02:40:50.807 --> 02:40:53.088]  If it's not well managed, it could be a recession.
[02:40:53.408 --> 02:40:54.368]  Okay, last question.
[02:40:54.889 --> 02:41:02.472]  We know there are now the biggest splits in the ruling intelligentsia and the main owners of the wealth inside the elite.
[02:41:02.492 --> 02:41:03.713]  We see this in publications.
[02:41:03.753 --> 02:41:04.713]  We see this in splits.
[02:41:05.114 --> 02:41:06.314]  I've talked to people inside.
[02:41:06.554 --> 02:41:10.256]  The last Bilderberg Group meeting was in the Canadian press, screaming at each other.
[02:41:10.916 --> 02:41:13.878]  Have you ever attended Bilderberg and have you seen a split in the past?
[02:41:14.559 --> 02:41:21.687]  Well, no, I haven't attended that meeting, but there are a lot of disagreements among the elites.
[02:41:22.789 --> 02:41:30.719]  One of the things that makes me more optimistic, though, is that there's a beginning to realize that we are facing some serious problems.
[02:41:31.603 --> 02:41:33.646]  That we can't go on as we have.
[02:41:33.686 --> 02:41:40.814]  But I'm saying the same institutions that have always done the same thing in the past feather their own nest at the expense of the third world and the first world.
[02:41:41.916 --> 02:41:44.018]  It doesn't seem like they're the people to continue.
[02:41:44.278 --> 02:41:47.762]  Every time they put us in harm's way, then they come back with a new solution.
[02:41:47.782 --> 02:41:48.924]  I mean, take debt forgiveness.
[02:41:49.304 --> 02:42:02.648]  I mean, you take, say, Nigeria borrows $5 billion, they end up paying $33 billion, and then now we call it debt forgiveness to cut back some of what they owe, if they've paid $30-something billion off of an initial, you know, $4 or $5 billion, and then they don't owe anything!
[02:42:03.308 --> 02:42:12.511]  I agree with you on that, and in fact it's worse than what you describe, because accompanying that debt forgiveness is a whole set of conditions that make them give up their sovereignty.
[02:42:13.491 --> 02:42:16.752]  And in some countries, the loans in the first place were
[02:42:17.782 --> 02:42:20.963]  We're made for arms payments that go to arms dealers.
[02:42:20.983 --> 02:42:24.364]  The money didn't even go to help the people of the country.
[02:42:24.564 --> 02:42:27.464]  What elite do you think is preeminent right now in global politics?
[02:42:27.484 --> 02:42:28.565]  That is, outside countries.
[02:42:29.305 --> 02:42:31.365]  44 of the biggest 100 economies are private corporations.
[02:42:31.765 --> 02:42:32.566]  What corporations?
[02:42:32.846 --> 02:42:33.466]  Is it Energy?
[02:42:33.526 --> 02:42:34.186]  Is it Defense?
[02:42:34.546 --> 02:42:36.066]  Is it the people at the Bilderberg Group?
[02:42:36.086 --> 02:42:36.827]  The CFR?
[02:42:37.087 --> 02:42:38.207]  I mean, who's the most powerful?
[02:42:38.227 --> 02:42:39.707]  Who has the most influence right now?
[02:42:40.227 --> 02:42:42.248]  Well, I wouldn't try to parse it that way.
[02:42:42.508 --> 02:42:43.648]  I wouldn't put it quite that way.
[02:42:44.208 --> 02:42:47.129]  All of these groups are powerful and influential.
[02:42:47.842 --> 02:42:57.928]  I think, unfortunately, in this current administration, the defense industries and the energy industries have really been running the show, and it has been disastrous.
[02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:10.235]  I don't think there's ever been a time in recent history where two groups, two industries like that, have exerted so much influence on policies to such disastrous effects.
[02:43:10.375 --> 02:43:12.877]  So there's not enough separation of powers?
[02:43:14.426 --> 02:43:20.249]  Well, we still have our different groups in Congress.
[02:43:20.269 --> 02:43:21.490]  We have the Executive Branch.
[02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:22.610]  What do you think of H.R.
[02:43:22.830 --> 02:43:26.272]  6166, the Enemy Combatants Military Commissions Act?
[02:43:27.292 --> 02:43:30.134]  I'm not sure I know all the details of that.
[02:43:30.394 --> 02:43:33.015]  Well, it abolished 9 of the 10 Bill of Rights.
[02:43:33.135 --> 02:43:34.956]  I know what bill you're talking about.
[02:43:35.036 --> 02:43:37.297]  It's the bill I think we're talking about.
[02:43:37.337 --> 02:43:39.018]  I don't know all the bills by all these numbers.
[02:43:39.591 --> 02:43:44.473]  But if it's what I think you're talking about, I think it's a disaster.
[02:43:44.493 --> 02:43:49.975]  Yeah, but one past three weeks ago, dealing with torture... Exactly.
[02:43:50.355 --> 02:43:55.037]  I grew up under the idea that there were certain basic things that defined us as Americans.
[02:43:55.137 --> 02:43:56.398]  Innocent until proven guilty.
[02:43:56.418 --> 02:43:57.438]  Due process, yeah.
[02:43:57.518 --> 02:44:01.240]  Due process, rid of habeas corpus, you can't be put in prison without...
[02:44:02.172 --> 02:44:07.456]  Uh, you know, uh, uh, government bringing charges against you.
[02:44:07.877 --> 02:44:10.118]  I think that almost defined us as Americans.
[02:44:10.318 --> 02:44:15.282]  Do you think that we are in danger of ending up having what you call the IMF riots someday here in America?
[02:44:15.302 --> 02:44:24.849]  Uh, I don't think we're in danger of those kinds of riots, but I do think that we ought to be thinking a lot more about our basic rights and principles.
[02:44:25.370 --> 02:44:31.214]  And that bill, as far as I can understand, really did compromise some of our basic rights.
[02:44:31.952 --> 02:44:44.961]  And we thought of it as only compromising the rights of some people who were not Americans, but once you start breaking down these principles, you know, there's a basic golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
[02:44:44.981 --> 02:44:45.881]  Well, that's what's scary!
[02:44:45.901 --> 02:44:48.703]  They said it didn't affect citizens, but it does say in there, it does, sir.
[02:44:49.203 --> 02:44:52.185]  Well, and not only that, other countries are going to reciprocate.
[02:44:53.186 --> 02:44:57.549]  And Americans are traveling all over the time, you know, doing business in other countries,
[02:44:58.734 --> 02:45:04.108]  So in fact, it does put Americans at jeopardy and no matter what you look at it.
[02:45:04.329 --> 02:45:05.733]  Do you ever talk to David Rockefeller?
[02:45:08.295 --> 02:45:10.855]  Not very often.
[02:45:11.035 --> 02:45:12.516]  What's on his mind when you talk to him?
[02:45:13.176 --> 02:45:16.377]  I haven't talked to him recently enough to be able to answer that question.
[02:45:16.657 --> 02:45:18.298]  The last time you talked to him, what was he talking about?
[02:45:18.338 --> 02:45:19.818]  I can't remember, actually.
[02:45:21.459 --> 02:45:26.960]  You're going to be here in Austin this weekend at the Texas Book Festival.
[02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:28.841]  Just type Texas Book Festival into Google, folks.
[02:45:29.161 --> 02:45:30.001]  You'll find out all about it.
[02:45:30.021 --> 02:45:31.862]  You're speaking Sunday at the Capitol, aren't you?
[02:45:32.562 --> 02:45:33.082]  That's right.
[02:45:33.722 --> 02:45:35.343]  On my book, Making Globalization Work.
[02:45:35.993 --> 02:45:39.936]  Well, maybe we'll pop in with the news crew and get a five-minute interview with you for the local TV show.
[02:45:40.276 --> 02:45:41.537]  Making globalization work?
[02:45:41.597 --> 02:45:42.838]  I think it's a dead horse.
[02:45:42.858 --> 02:45:47.542]  I don't think you can make something that's fundamentally been flawed and compromised work.
[02:45:47.582 --> 02:45:50.724]  But we are globalized now, so who knows where we're going?
[02:45:50.744 --> 02:45:51.745]  We can make it work better.
[02:45:51.765 --> 02:45:53.467]  Yeah, I guess so.
[02:45:53.487 --> 02:45:54.587]  Maybe on our deathbed.
[02:45:54.868 --> 02:45:56.489]  That's really what we're talking about.
[02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:59.851]  Well, you're going to be there speaking about the new book?
[02:46:00.272 --> 02:46:05.696]  That's right, and trying to explain how we can make... why it hasn't been working, the ways in which it hasn't been working.
[02:46:06.147 --> 02:46:08.308]  And so ideas about how we can make it work better.
[02:46:09.169 --> 02:46:10.510]  But they did get mad at you.
[02:46:10.570 --> 02:46:12.571]  I mean, some say you left, some say you were fired.
[02:46:12.711 --> 02:46:14.392]  What really happened at the World Bank to you?
[02:46:15.332 --> 02:46:16.833]  Oh, well, it was a mixture.
[02:46:17.394 --> 02:46:23.257]  What they said is that I could stay as long as I didn't say anything and didn't talk to the press, didn't talk on radio.
[02:46:24.738 --> 02:46:34.544]  I had originally come there and said, you know, if I'm going to go accept this kind of job, I want to be able to speak my mind, talk about what I think is what ought to be done for
[02:46:35.314 --> 02:46:41.857]  Making the world a better place, helping the developing countries, helping the poor in the United States and other advanced industrial countries.
[02:46:42.737 --> 02:46:48.800]  They weren't interested in that, and so we amicably parted ways.
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:52.001]  Did they get mad when all those documents magically were released?
[02:46:53.382 --> 02:47:01.045]  Well, people at IMF were not very happy when I criticized them.
[02:47:01.245 --> 02:47:02.906]  I think they were particularly unhappy
[02:47:03.726 --> 02:47:08.612]  Because I predicted that certain things would happen as a result of their policies.
[02:47:09.493 --> 02:47:10.514]  I turned out to be right.
[02:47:10.554 --> 02:47:14.900]  If I'd been wrong, I think they could have forgiven me, but the fact that I was right made them particularly upset.
[02:47:16.424 --> 02:47:21.608]  And when you say correction, again, the Financial Times and others are saying they see massive upheaval.
[02:47:22.369 --> 02:47:28.554]  I mean, when you say correction, are you talking about... I mean, openly, the financial elite are talking about trying to survive what's coming.
[02:47:28.674 --> 02:47:30.955]  Do you think the debt bubble will pop, or what's going to happen?
[02:47:31.336 --> 02:47:34.898]  Well, I think it all depends on how well this whole thing is managed.
[02:47:34.939 --> 02:47:45.767]  There is absolutely no doubt that there is misalignment, is the euphemism that people use, and that there will be a correction.
[02:47:46.357 --> 02:47:48.838]  I think if it's handled well, there will be a slowdown.
[02:47:48.958 --> 02:47:50.418]  We already see a slowdown.
[02:47:50.458 --> 02:47:54.920]  The numbers that came out today on the quarterly growth figures show the slowdown.
[02:47:55.660 --> 02:48:01.322]  If it's well managed, it will go from the slowdown into a recovery.
[02:48:01.862 --> 02:48:02.842]  It's going to be difficult.
[02:48:02.862 --> 02:48:04.383]  How is the management right now?
[02:48:04.443 --> 02:48:05.503]  Are they doing the right thing?
[02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:16.614]  No, it's been, this has been perhaps the worst six years of mismanagement of the macroeconomy.
[02:48:17.034 --> 02:48:23.077]  I think there's a broad consensus on both parties about the mismanagement of the economy.
[02:48:23.137 --> 02:48:24.578]  When do you see it imploding then?
[02:48:25.410 --> 02:48:32.117]  Well, as I say, I think that we can avoid an implosion if we manage this very carefully, but it's going to be very risky.
[02:48:32.317 --> 02:48:33.939]  Okay, and you're talking the next 12 months?
[02:48:34.179 --> 02:48:34.620]  24 months?
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:38.203]  I think we're going to go through some very difficult times in the next 12 months.
[02:48:38.504 --> 02:48:39.625]  That's 24 months, yes.
[02:48:39.745 --> 02:48:41.387]  Okay, thank you, sir, for joining us.
[02:48:41.527 --> 02:48:41.947]  Take care.
[02:48:42.147 --> 02:48:42.828]  Okay, thank you.
[02:48:43.148 --> 02:48:43.469]  You bet.
[02:48:44.190 --> 02:48:44.470]  Oh, boy.
[02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:49.320]  It's here!
[02:48:49.541 --> 02:48:54.324]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.684 --> 02:49:02.369]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.029 --> 02:49:10.093]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.494 --> 02:49:17.318]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:17.853 --> 02:49:21.894]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.194 --> 02:49:25.715]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.175 --> 02:49:28.096]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.436 --> 02:49:32.357]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.638 --> 02:49:47.479]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:49.341]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:49:49.741 --> 02:49:50.001]  What?
[02:49:50.361 --> 02:49:50.722]  Again?
[02:49:51.142 --> 02:49:52.743]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:49:52.823 --> 02:49:57.266]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:49:57.486 --> 02:49:58.787]  Why did you do that?
[02:49:58.987 --> 02:50:04.791]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:50:05.072 --> 02:50:06.112]  Are we there yet?
[02:50:06.212 --> 02:50:07.293]  for the entire trip.
[02:50:07.533 --> 02:50:09.735]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:50:10.215 --> 02:50:11.176]  Great idea.
[02:50:11.196 --> 02:50:14.058]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:16.925]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:50:17.125 --> 02:50:21.514]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:50:21.794 --> 02:50:22.095]  Honey!
[02:50:22.915 --> 02:50:24.155]  You're terrific!
[02:50:24.555 --> 02:50:26.056]  Oh honey, so are you!
[02:50:26.156 --> 02:50:29.557]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:50:29.857 --> 02:50:30.637]  Now can we stop?
[02:50:31.137 --> 02:50:31.877]  I need to go too.
[02:50:32.157 --> 02:50:36.618]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:45.260 --> 02:50:53.207]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:50:53.667 --> 02:50:56.850]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[02:51:48.429 --> 02:51:54.613]  I'm not bragging, but I want police and military and government people listening who don't study wide spectrum data
[02:51:55.771 --> 02:51:59.474]  To realize that I can have an engineer in about the collapse of buildings.
[02:51:59.554 --> 02:52:02.136]  I can have a Nobel Prize winner in economics on.
[02:52:02.776 --> 02:52:04.677]  We can have somebody on about ranch management.
[02:52:04.697 --> 02:52:06.199]  We can have somebody on about any issue.
[02:52:06.219 --> 02:52:08.901]  If I'm going to speak on something, I know what I'm talking about.
[02:52:10.081 --> 02:52:10.462]  Okay?
[02:52:11.022 --> 02:52:12.243]  World government's real.
[02:52:12.263 --> 02:52:13.964]  They're planning to take everything you've got.
[02:52:14.545 --> 02:52:21.850]  All the elite experts in economics and banking are saying that we are going to have a massive correction.
[02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:24.622]  And most of them are saying, we're not going to make it out of it.
[02:52:24.682 --> 02:52:26.263]  You heard him say it really bad.
[02:52:27.004 --> 02:52:27.945]  Global depression.
[02:52:27.965 --> 02:52:29.026]  Ron Paul saying it.
[02:52:29.867 --> 02:52:31.928]  And I talked to stockbrokers, business advisors.
[02:52:32.509 --> 02:52:33.230]  They don't know anything.
[02:52:33.270 --> 02:52:39.155]  They play within the false paradigm that they're projected, that they're given by the global corporations that own the financial media.
[02:52:40.760 --> 02:52:43.101]  And you try to talk to somebody who's a stockbroker.
[02:52:43.321 --> 02:52:45.261]  What do you know about stocks, Alex?
[02:52:45.601 --> 02:52:52.463]  Well, I know the Dow's rigged with only winners, and I know the money supply's been devalued by 44%, so the Dow's really at 6,200 and something.
[02:52:52.543 --> 02:52:53.763]  Oh, what's that?
[02:52:53.863 --> 02:52:55.103]  Oh, money devalue?
[02:52:55.143 --> 02:52:55.923]  What's that mean?
[02:52:57.324 --> 02:52:59.084]  And again, I don't even claim to be that smart.
[02:52:59.184 --> 02:53:00.164]  I just study the stuff.
[02:53:00.884 --> 02:53:04.225]  And let me tell you, I see bad, bad, bad, bad all over the place.
[02:53:05.445 --> 02:53:07.126]  And so we know what we're talking about on 9-11.
[02:53:07.146 --> 02:53:08.146]  North American Union.
[02:53:09.835 --> 02:53:12.237]  The economy, the dollar, everything, okay?
[02:53:12.257 --> 02:53:14.880]  This show needs to be on every talk station in the country.
[02:53:14.980 --> 02:53:15.300]  It isn't.
[02:53:15.961 --> 02:53:18.903]  If we had real information getting out there, we could save this country.
[02:53:19.904 --> 02:53:20.905]  I know we got loaded phone lines.
[02:53:20.945 --> 02:53:23.047]  I'll try to take calls here at the end quickly, each caller.
[02:53:23.127 --> 02:53:26.670]  It's just... I'll be on the radio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:53:26.710 --> 02:53:28.232]  We're going to have Aaron Russo on again.
[02:53:28.292 --> 02:53:29.013]  Be sure and join us.
[02:53:29.793 --> 02:53:32.256]  Bunch of news, and you can listen via InfoWars.com.
[02:53:33.411 --> 02:53:38.876]  Or, hopefully stations out there that are picking up this show will pick it up, or if you can't carry it live, re-air the new show I'm doing.
[02:53:38.896 --> 02:53:41.258]  A lot of new stations turning it on, I want to thank them.
[02:53:42.639 --> 02:53:49.585]  And, uh, please get Aaron Russo's new film, American Freedom from Fascism, available, showing the Federal Reserve, showing who these scoundrels are.
[02:53:49.605 --> 02:53:54.149]  There's a reason they ran Joseph Siglitz out of there, because he wouldn't play ball with them.
[02:53:54.769 --> 02:53:56.891]  He's a globalist, but he doesn't believe in hurting all the people.
[02:53:56.931 --> 02:53:57.712]  Well, you're gone, buddy.
[02:53:58.212 --> 02:53:58.933]  Nobel Prize winner.
[02:54:00.413 --> 02:54:01.594]  And this is how it works.
[02:54:01.634 --> 02:54:02.334]  He's got a soul.
[02:54:02.374 --> 02:54:03.155]  He's got a conscience.
[02:54:03.255 --> 02:54:04.536]  I don't think he's just playing good cop.
[02:54:04.556 --> 02:54:05.256]  He is a good cop.
[02:54:05.477 --> 02:54:08.359]  But he doesn't understand the full paradigm.
[02:54:08.379 --> 02:54:11.981]  And he understands his limited spectrum of analysis, which is understandable.
[02:54:12.021 --> 02:54:15.403]  He can go to higher levels than any of us when he studies one small sliver.
[02:54:15.523 --> 02:54:16.704]  I study the full spectrum.
[02:54:17.064 --> 02:54:20.427]  And I mainly go to history because humans tend to do the same things over and over again.
[02:54:20.707 --> 02:54:24.509]  So I can see a condensed version of what's happening today in any aspect I wish.
[02:54:24.549 --> 02:54:25.190]  That's what I've done.
[02:54:26.112 --> 02:54:27.612]  Please get America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:54:27.632 --> 02:54:29.473]  It exposes the banking system, what's really happening.
[02:54:30.013 --> 02:54:31.553]  Available at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:31.573 --> 02:54:39.835]  And you get Terror Storm for $10, $9.95 when you do order that, when you do get America Freedom to Fascism at InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:54:39.935 --> 02:54:42.916]  Ron in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:43.696 --> 02:54:47.097]  Alex, I just had a comment about the gentleman that called in earlier.
[02:54:47.797 --> 02:54:53.859]  If he doesn't believe anything that's going on and he believes that everything is just fine, why is he listening to your show?
[02:54:54.727 --> 02:54:55.848]  And why is he calling in?
[02:54:57.168 --> 02:55:01.230]  I think it's our own fears that keep us from realizing the truth.
[02:55:01.270 --> 02:55:02.391]  We don't want to see the truth.
[02:55:03.591 --> 02:55:06.793]  I wrote a quick caption, if I could read it for you.
[02:55:06.813 --> 02:55:07.313]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:55:07.894 --> 02:55:13.056]  The chains of our captivity are not bound so tight as to deprive the mind of free thought.
[02:55:13.756 --> 02:55:22.761]  They lay rather on the foundation of the ever-shifting sands of lies and iniquity, shielded from the light of truth by the shadow of our own fears.
[02:55:23.277 --> 02:55:30.502]  Well, I just had a 45-minute discussion with a Nobel Prize winner, former head of economics at the World Bank, and he agreed with everything I said.
[02:55:31.022 --> 02:55:32.963]  And I said neo-mercantilism.
[02:55:32.983 --> 02:55:34.004]  He didn't write that in his book.
[02:55:34.284 --> 02:55:35.025]  I studied history.
[02:55:35.065 --> 02:55:36.185]  It's mercantilism.
[02:55:36.506 --> 02:55:38.147]  Globalism's mercantilism.
[02:55:38.387 --> 02:55:39.608]  And I'm not tooting my horn, folks.
[02:55:39.648 --> 02:55:40.608]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:55:41.069 --> 02:55:42.049]  Thank you for the call, Ron.
[02:55:42.089 --> 02:55:43.010]  Tom in California.
[02:55:43.030 --> 02:55:44.431]  Sorry about Margaret and Eric and others.
[02:55:44.691 --> 02:55:45.251]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:55:45.271 --> 02:55:45.672]  Take us out.
[02:55:48.297 --> 02:55:57.022]  I was wondering if you could give us some advice on starting a newsletter that basically copies all the headlines of Prison Planet from my local area here.
[02:55:57.042 --> 02:56:02.026]  For people that don't read the internet, maybe would pick up a newsletter instead, read the same headline.
[02:56:02.046 --> 02:56:03.006]  Do you have any advice?
[02:56:03.747 --> 02:56:10.531]  I'd take the articles we write every week, they're the best, and I'd take four or five of those every week or every month, or ten, whatever, and do it that way.
[02:56:11.301 --> 02:56:15.424]  And to get freedom to fascism in my local theater, that's the way to go about doing that.
[02:56:15.884 --> 02:56:16.784]  Call Aaron Russo.
[02:56:17.205 --> 02:56:17.965]  I'm out of time.
[02:56:17.985 --> 02:56:19.006]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:56:19.046 --> 02:56:20.326]  Have a good, safe weekend.
[02:56:20.406 --> 02:56:21.247]  Ask God for guidance.
[02:56:21.307 --> 02:56:21.967]  Love your family.
