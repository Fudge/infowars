[00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:06.392]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:08.113]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:09.934]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:11.394]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:13.115]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:17.397]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:21.979]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.101]  We've got a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:40.622 --> 00:00:44.863]  We have a porting down survivor coming on.
[00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:52.746]  That was the big bio and chemical weapons laboratory over in England where they killed so many servicemen and women.
[00:00:53.426 --> 00:01:01.749]  And it's part of a larger global program with Western governments known as Project Shad, testing chemical and biologicals on the military.
[00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:06.916]  We're going to spend an hour on this and just go over who the real terrorists are.
[00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:10.317]  I mean, who has attacked the American people before?
[00:01:10.397 --> 00:01:16.138]  This is just one case of thousands and thousands that have been declassified and made public.
[00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:21.919]  Then, of course, the war drums to attack Iran had quieted some the last few weeks.
[00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.140]  Now they're beating at fever pitch right now.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.481]  And Iran is issuing some of its own threats.
[00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.641]  And I want to compare...
[00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:32.414]  We're good to go.
[00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:32.794]  I think?
[00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:52.890]  It topped television, what, four years ago in South Korea.
[00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.193]  It just topped television as the most popular pastime with the most time spent on it than television in England.
[00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:05.316]  And we're set in just a year or so for it to be the number one pastime in the United States.
[00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:13.301]  But this particular article out of the Daily Mail over in the UK, Internet tops TV as most popular pastime.
[00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:17.343]  We'll get into what that really means after this quick break.
[00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:21.646]  Not only has Mr. Bolton come out, the U.S.
[00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:22.506]  envoy to the U.N.
[00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:28.250]  and threatened to attack Iran, Cheney has said that there would be dire consequences if they don't totally submit.
[00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.211]  And it doesn't matter how much they submit, they will be attacked.
[00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:31.952]  We all know that.
[00:02:32.892 --> 00:02:36.454]  Israel's saying it will, quote, have to act on Iran if U.N.
[00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:40.757]  can't, mirroring Bush's comments on Iraq three years ago.
[00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:43.638]  We're coming up on that anniversary of the attack here in just a few days.
[00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.060]  Also, House renews U.S.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.780]  Patriot Act.
[00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:48.912]  Bush to sign into law.
[00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:50.872]  They're calling it the reauthorization.
[00:02:50.932 --> 00:02:55.194]  I call it the radical expansion on many, many fronts.
[00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:58.375]  A new national police force with unlimited arrest powers.
[00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:03.217]  All of your prescription drugs, not just the stuff dealing with methamphetamine.
[00:03:03.998 --> 00:03:09.100]  Non-prescription drugs being uploaded, card being swiped, federal control over your local purchases.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.501]  So many facets to it.
[00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.360]  So we'll get into some of those reports as well.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.942]  And we're going to have open phones today, as we do almost every day.
[00:03:19.982 --> 00:03:22.522]  Some days we have three or four guests on, so we don't take calls.
[00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:24.523]  But today is not one of those rarities.
[00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:26.364]  We will have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:03:26.724 --> 00:03:28.605]  And I'll try to go to your calls early in the shower.
[00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:28.745]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:29.165]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.785]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.930]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.831]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:09.766]  And, of course, JonesReport.com, now updated and redesigned and will be updated on a daily basis, so be sure and visit JonesReport.com on a daily basis.
[00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:14.288]  We're going to really build and expand and develop that site, and it has only begun.
[00:04:14.328 --> 00:04:24.413]  I built it, what, four or five years ago, and I've just had it kind of sitting out there waiting to be fitted out for combat in the Infowar, and now it is being launched.
[00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:26.719]  We're good to go.
[00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.610]  Theater of the Info War.
[00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:45.451]  All right, we'll be right back to go into the news.
[00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:57.655]  Iran, what's happening with the Internet, new developments with the Bork deals, it's all coming up right here on the GCN Radio Network, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:04.887]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:05:05.147 --> 00:05:08.648]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:05:08.748 --> 00:05:12.690]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.073]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:19.473 --> 00:05:27.377]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:05:27.797 --> 00:05:33.141]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:37.064]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:37.424 --> 00:05:39.286]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:41.508]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:46.351]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:52.296]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:57.719]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.520]  Protect your family.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.462]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:06:04.722 --> 00:06:05.422]  Hello, my friends.
[00:06:05.502 --> 00:06:06.302]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:06.622 --> 00:06:11.304]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:06:11.644 --> 00:06:18.387]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:20.688]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:06:20.888 --> 00:06:23.750]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.493]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:06:28.693 --> 00:06:33.095]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:40.559]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.261]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.142]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:06:45.282 --> 00:06:51.286]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:59.051]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:04.655]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:08.278]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:11.920]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:07:12.173 --> 00:07:15.415]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:20.919]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:30.586]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:32.027]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:07:32.047 --> 00:07:37.491]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:07:37.993 --> 00:07:42.415]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:43.876]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:07:44.036 --> 00:07:48.418]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:50.238]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[00:07:50.258 --> 00:07:55.241]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.312 --> 00:08:16.136]  Now, let's remember that the Neocons lied us to war back in 2003, back in March of 2003.
[00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:17.757]  And the Downing Street Memo
[00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:33.581]  We're good to go.
[00:08:57.322 --> 00:09:03.806]  The September 20, 2000 PNAC Rebuilding America's Defenses Strategy for the 21st Century.
[00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:04.827]  That's the title of it.
[00:09:05.287 --> 00:09:06.909]  And it's on the PNAC website.
[00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:08.149]  And it's signed Dick Cheney.
[00:09:08.189 --> 00:09:09.710]  He wrote that particular document.
[00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:13.953]  And in there he says we need to kill the Arabs using race-specific bioweapons.
[00:09:13.973 --> 00:09:14.854]  We need to legitimize...
[00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.035]  We're good to go.
[00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:16.195]  I think?
[00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:39.095]  We don't need Treasury Secretary O'Neill saying it.
[00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:42.677]  People can say they're trying to be partisan, or they're sour grapes.
[00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:47.439]  Man, I got Dick Cheney, you've got Dick Cheney, explaining their stratagem to you.
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:53.503]  In 1999, Bush told his biographer, his biographer, the guy he hired, I want to be a war president.
[00:09:54.023 --> 00:09:56.664]  If there's a war, they can't question me domestically.
[00:09:56.704 --> 00:09:57.725]  That's really the big prize.
[00:09:57.845 --> 00:09:58.485]  It's America.
[00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:01.707]  And I'll be famous.
[00:10:01.827 --> 00:10:03.428]  I mean, just lunatic type stuff.
[00:10:03.468 --> 00:10:04.869]  Now, that's his biographer.
[00:10:05.586 --> 00:10:07.048]  The person George Bush hired.
[00:10:07.088 --> 00:10:09.250]  So we have them all dead to rights.
[00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.351]  We have them caught red-handed.
[00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:11.292]  They should all be impeached.
[00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:12.353]  They should all be indicted.
[00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:17.199]  They should all go to prison for espionage, for fraud, for extortion.
[00:10:17.739 --> 00:10:19.341]  Just all the things they've done.
[00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:24.166]  The bid rigging, the war profiteering, the no-bid contracts.
[00:10:24.366 --> 00:10:24.747]  All of it.
[00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:26.689]  All of it.
[00:10:28.306 --> 00:10:29.467]  It's unbelievable.
[00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:37.894]  The foreign lobbyists, the sellout of ports and roads and water and defense contracts, all of this is espionage.
[00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:39.135]  It's a sellout of this country.
[00:10:39.855 --> 00:10:41.516]  And the Democrats are just as involved.
[00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:44.159]  Some people go, well, the Democrats are doing it too.
[00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:45.480]  Like, that makes it okay.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.862]  Or back when Democrats were in office, well, Republicans do it too.
[00:10:48.922 --> 00:10:50.423]  Yeah, that makes it even worse.
[00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:51.164]  Exactly.
[00:10:51.704 --> 00:10:52.185]  Exactly.
[00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:53.506]  We're in a lot of trouble here.
[00:10:54.562 --> 00:11:01.628]  But, I mean, no one can deny that we've got our afterburners on as a country going down the rat hole of the New World Order under Bush.
[00:11:01.668 --> 00:11:03.190]  I mean, it's never moved this fast.
[00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.673]  And, of course, that's just because we're later on in time.
[00:11:06.713 --> 00:11:08.294]  We're into 2006.
[00:11:08.614 --> 00:11:10.015]  We're deeper into the New World Order.
[00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.217]  If it was a Democrat in office, it would be the exact same thing.
[00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:17.182]  Showing how we've got, for all intents and purposes, a dictatorship.
[00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:22.086]  So, with that backdrop, India has signed no foreign treaties.
[00:11:23.021 --> 00:11:25.885]  India has not signed the Non-Proliferation Act.
[00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.227]  They've not signed the inspections.
[00:11:28.267 --> 00:11:30.270]  They've not signed any of these deals.
[00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:31.651]  They've never signed them.
[00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.353]  Pakistan won't sign them.
[00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:35.335]  None of these countries will sign them.
[00:11:35.355 --> 00:11:36.597]  North Korea won't sign them.
[00:11:37.458 --> 00:11:38.319]  And our government...
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.341]  We're good to go.
[00:11:55.069 --> 00:12:08.796]  Meanwhile, that Kahn, that big doctor, Clinton signed W-1999, then Bush reauthorized it in early 2001, days after getting into office, ordering the FBI to leave Kahn Laboratories alone.
[00:12:09.657 --> 00:12:14.379]  And then you've got Kahn on the cover of Time Magazine, you know, Dr. Nuke, oh, he's going to get us.
[00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:16.060]  Our government wanted...
[00:12:16.934 --> 00:12:18.255]  Pakistan to get the nukes.
[00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:19.395]  They got the nukes.
[00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:21.636]  We've helped transfer them the MIRV technology.
[00:12:21.816 --> 00:12:23.917]  They've helped give India the MIRV technology.
[00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:26.298]  Do you know what MIRV technology is?
[00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:27.598]  It's the re-entry devices.
[00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:45.946]  So when the nose cone pops off the intercontinental ballistic missile, or the theater range missile, it doesn't matter, when it comes back into the atmosphere or when it gets over its targets at, say, 80,000 feet or 100,000 feet, the nose cone pops off and there's a bunch of little missiles.
[00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:48.359]  Okay, that's MIRV technology.
[00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:56.049]  And then they target and specifically release with their own guidance systems and go after the different targets they're going to hit.
[00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:21.848]  So let's say over Texas, at 150,000 feet, 80,000 feet, they can open at different levels, one of these missiles opens up, and then 12 to 22, depending on which MERV package it is, there's different variants of them, hit Dallas, hit Austin, hit Fort Hood, hit San Antonio, hit Corpus Christi, hit Fort Worth, hit all these cities.
[00:13:26.224 --> 00:13:26.605]  India.
[00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:34.517]  India, different governments in it, you know, every few years, India, billion-plus people now.
[00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:39.245]  China openly threatening to nuke us on a routine basis, calling press conferences.
[00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:46.936]  Every few months it's saying, we're targeting 200 cities right now with MIRV technology, in our ICBMs, intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:52.758]  We will destroy you if you get involved in any of our holdings or any of our assets or any of our national interests.
[00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:57.701]  And certainly with Taiwan, if you don't stop selling to Taiwan, we may go ahead and printably hit you.
[00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:11.650]  And if Taiwan targets us, that is, aims any of its island missile batteries at us, and they've got weapons aimed at them, China does, we will immediately hit you with an all-out sneak attack.
[00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:14.473]  Oh, we love you, China.
[00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:16.414]  Oh, let us sell you some more U.S.
[00:14:16.514 --> 00:14:18.176]  assets, some more ports, some more roads.
[00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:22.641]  The government will only approve the deal and select basically no-bid contracts again.
[00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:47.586]  You know, I hear this controlled media, the so-called liberal media, there's nothing liberal about them, go, well, what are all these libs having problems with?
[00:14:48.306 --> 00:14:50.688]  I mean, so what if Halliburton gets a contract?
[00:14:50.708 --> 00:14:53.349]  We're not about to give it to them greedy Frenchies.
[00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.371]  I mean, neocons.
[00:14:56.011 --> 00:15:02.395]  Folks, foreigners were never allowed to get those Iraq defense contracts to begin with unless it was Israel or England.
[00:15:03.376 --> 00:15:03.716]  Okay?
[00:15:04.933 --> 00:15:07.554]  So when you heard, hey, no bid, that's good.
[00:15:07.974 --> 00:15:09.315]  Don't give the foreigners a bid.
[00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:11.075]  America deserves that.
[00:15:11.655 --> 00:15:15.137]  It was American companies that weren't allowed to get those bids.
[00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:16.777]  It was no bid to anyone.
[00:15:16.797 --> 00:15:24.680]  But see, I've got to get emails to this day and arguments and people stopping me on the street going, Alex, I heard you say you're against no-bid contracts.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.381]  I work for Hella Burton.
[00:15:26.641 --> 00:15:28.002]  What are you, for the French, getting it?
[00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:28.743]  And I go, wait a minute.
[00:15:28.963 --> 00:15:30.804]  Those are no bid for anyone getting it.
[00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:31.885]  No bid's allowed.
[00:15:31.945 --> 00:15:32.985]  No bid means no bid.
[00:15:33.326 --> 00:15:33.586]  Huh?
[00:15:33.866 --> 00:15:37.889]  Well, still, you know, we do good for this country.
[00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:40.991]  See, I mean, and they know how dumb you are.
[00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:42.211]  They know how ignorant you are.
[00:15:42.251 --> 00:15:45.393]  They know how diverted you are and how distracted you are.
[00:15:45.413 --> 00:15:47.555]  So they lie to you and go, well, no bid.
[00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:49.116]  The Frenchies don't deserve it.
[00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:50.597]  The Frenchies.
[00:15:51.798 --> 00:15:51.978]  So...
[00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.631]  That's the little mind games and tricks they play.
[00:15:55.651 --> 00:16:06.276]  And if you like being fooled, you like being lied to, you like being conned, you like being laughed at and called a slave in globalist published policy papers routinely, then fine, fine, fine.
[00:16:06.616 --> 00:16:07.436]  Just believe it.
[00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:08.236]  Don't believe me.
[00:16:08.516 --> 00:16:12.378]  Turn the radio off, change the channel, and you can go tune into all the lies and enjoy yourself.
[00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:14.259]  Now, meanwhile...
[00:16:15.786 --> 00:16:21.407]  Our government, that's been hijacked by these corporate interests, has said they're going to strike over 200 targets in Iran.
[00:16:21.587 --> 00:16:25.388]  Over 200 targets with simultaneous bunker-busting missiles.
[00:16:25.768 --> 00:16:27.989]  They're going to bomb any industry connected.
[00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:28.889]  That means power.
[00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:30.209]  That means water.
[00:16:30.469 --> 00:16:31.469]  That means support.
[00:16:31.769 --> 00:16:32.950]  That means roads.
[00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.330]  That means airports.
[00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.310]  That means industrial centers.
[00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.751]  They are going to de-industrialize.
[00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:39.651]  They're going to knock them back to the Stone Age.
[00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:41.211]  Good!
[00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:43.872]  I hope you turn them into a parking lot!
[00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:45.033]  Well, don't worry.
[00:16:45.073 --> 00:16:48.195]  We're losing our industry, too, from about the same globalists we're being enslaved to.
[00:16:48.275 --> 00:16:49.395]  So giggle.
[00:16:49.435 --> 00:16:50.356]  Giggle to your masters.
[00:16:50.396 --> 00:16:50.856]  I understand.
[00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.157]  It's very funny to be a slave.
[00:16:52.658 --> 00:16:55.720]  Just don't think it's the Iranians who are going to get shackled.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.660]  It's you, too, Bubba.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.842]  They want, look up, parking lot.
[00:17:00.223 --> 00:17:00.823]  We've all heard it.
[00:17:01.263 --> 00:17:02.244]  Just nuke them.
[00:17:03.585 --> 00:17:05.066]  And with a USA flag beside us.
[00:17:05.086 --> 00:17:06.167]  I see those bumper stickers every day.
[00:17:07.107 --> 00:17:08.128]  Just nuke them.
[00:17:09.808 --> 00:17:10.849]  Can you find them on a map?
[00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:11.409]  No!
[00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.190]  Nuke them!
[00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.572]  But do you know our government overthrew their government when it was pro-America?
[00:17:15.912 --> 00:17:20.535]  And actually wanted radical governments in there from the start to destabilize the region so they don't have freedom?
[00:17:20.996 --> 00:17:21.676]  Shut up!
[00:17:21.756 --> 00:17:22.276]  Call me!
[00:17:22.897 --> 00:17:25.739]  Okay, I'm going to stop doing the neocon accent.
[00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:26.619]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:27.300]  I apologize.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.701]  I'm just sick of it.
[00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:29.361]  What about you?
[00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:29.421]  So...
[00:17:33.163 --> 00:17:39.586]  We're sitting here looking at this, and so Iran's being threatened with being attacked, so they say, well, if you attack us, we'll strike back.
[00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:42.467]  And the media goes, can you believe the radical statements?
[00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:43.888]  Can you believe it?
[00:17:44.248 --> 00:17:46.549]  They say if they're attacked, they'll fight back.
[00:17:47.129 --> 00:17:56.953]  I've never heard of someone as evil, as radical, as extreme, that if they are premeditatedly attacked for no reason,
[00:17:58.245 --> 00:18:00.727]  Other than Empire, that they will fight back.
[00:18:00.807 --> 00:18:03.729]  Can you imagine that no one's ever been that evil?
[00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.310]  No one.
[00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:08.853]  No one has ever been as evil as to defend themselves.
[00:18:09.153 --> 00:18:18.740]  I mean, next time somebody busts in your family member's house and is going to try to rape them and kill them, and let's say your cousin, who's a woman, shoots them, you ought to go tell the cops to arrest her.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.784]  Can you believe, officer, that she fired on the person attacking her?
[00:18:25.285 --> 00:18:30.048]  Why, officer, after the intruder came in and stabbed her, she got to a gun and shot him.
[00:18:30.088 --> 00:18:35.190]  She should have taken her clothes off to make it easier for him to stab her and rape her.
[00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.991]  Can you believe?
[00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:39.713]  Okay, I said I'd stop that voice.
[00:18:39.773 --> 00:18:40.473]  I just can't help it.
[00:18:40.893 --> 00:18:42.934]  Can you believe?
[00:18:43.495 --> 00:18:47.817]  Can you believe that they would actually fight back?
[00:18:49.318 --> 00:18:49.498]  So...
[00:18:50.968 --> 00:18:52.830]  So that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.071]  Can't find it on a map.
[00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.092]  Know nothing about the country.
[00:18:55.152 --> 00:18:55.953]  Just knock them.
[00:18:56.173 --> 00:18:58.576]  Can you believe?
[00:18:58.696 --> 00:19:01.158]  And so Iran's saying, if you attack us, we're going to attack you.
[00:19:01.218 --> 00:19:02.760]  And it's shock headlines.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.681]  Dun, dun, dun.
[00:19:03.861 --> 00:19:04.441]  Top story.
[00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:05.983]  Iran threatens America.
[00:19:07.136 --> 00:19:15.702]  That'd be like if somebody said, I'm going to come over to your house and knock your teeth out and beat your head in with a ball-peen hammer, and you said back, well, if you do that, I'm going to fight back against you.
[00:19:16.023 --> 00:19:17.484]  You're coming into a world of hurt.
[00:19:17.504 --> 00:19:18.945]  You're going to get some pain back, Bubba.
[00:19:19.505 --> 00:19:25.490]  Can you believe I threatened to kill them and they said they'd fight back against me?
[00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.291]  I can't believe it.
[00:19:28.212 --> 00:19:28.752]  And here it is.
[00:19:28.852 --> 00:19:29.032]  U.S.
[00:19:29.052 --> 00:19:32.135]  says Iran has enough uranium to make 10 nuclear weapons.
[00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:33.716]  Total lie.
[00:19:34.637 --> 00:19:35.218]  Here's another one.
[00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:38.340]  Israel will have to act on Iran if UN can't.
[00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:41.082]  And Iran threatens U.S.
[00:19:41.122 --> 00:19:44.545]  with harm and pain after being threatened with attack.
[00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:47.788]  What are you, anti-America Alex?
[00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:52.551]  I just don't like China threatening to nuke us in press conferences.
[00:19:52.571 --> 00:19:53.852]  You're like, oh, they're good.
[00:19:53.873 --> 00:19:54.553]  They're good.
[00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:55.394]  Don't worry about them.
[00:19:55.614 --> 00:19:59.417]  Then a country that's done nothing and signed on to all the treaties is about to be attacked.
[00:20:02.006 --> 00:20:06.087]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:57.796]  888-216-2461
[00:21:01.676 --> 00:21:02.637]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.717 --> 00:21:07.501]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.681 --> 00:21:15.488]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.748 --> 00:21:21.113]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:28.299]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:29.019]  We're good to go.
[00:21:47.188 --> 00:21:47.809]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.385 --> 00:22:03.026]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:22:03.146 --> 00:22:07.249]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:07.389 --> 00:22:10.271]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:10.351 --> 00:22:17.056]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:17.236 --> 00:22:20.259]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:22.840]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.704]  Like murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:22:27.944 --> 00:22:28.684]  We're good to go.
[00:22:57.776 --> 00:23:04.678]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:09.260]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:17.183]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:21.611]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:23:21.991 --> 00:23:35.440]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:39.223]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of stem enhancers.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.882]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:47.164]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:23:47.304 --> 00:23:49.565]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[00:23:49.865 --> 00:23:50.846]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:23:50.886 --> 00:23:53.067]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:23:53.087 --> 00:23:55.168]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:15.336]  We had a caller named Odie, and I like the Andy Griffin Show.
[00:24:15.436 --> 00:24:16.896]  I wish Odie wouldn't have hung up.
[00:24:17.877 --> 00:24:19.837]  Odie, why don't you call back in if you can get back in?
[00:24:20.257 --> 00:24:25.179]  Your calls, Leo, Mark, Charles, Mike, John, others, they're coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:28.199]  Let me just try to calm down and cover the Iran situation.
[00:24:28.679 --> 00:24:34.581]  So there's all this shocked amazement that Iran is saying, if you attack us, we'll fight back.
[00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.079]  And it's top story.
[00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:37.020]  Everyone's freaking out.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:37.860]  See, they're deadly.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.720]  See, they're the enemy.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.000]  Can you believe it?
[00:24:40.601 --> 00:24:46.642]  Iran threatened the United States with harm and pain Wednesday for its role in Hollington before the U.N.
[00:24:46.662 --> 00:24:49.643]  Security Council over its disputed nuclear program.
[00:24:50.524 --> 00:24:52.424]  Now, that's not... See, that's an AP article.
[00:24:52.464 --> 00:24:53.565]  That's not what they said.
[00:24:53.605 --> 00:24:54.965]  I've got the actual transcript here.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:55.980]  Let's see.
[00:24:56.441 --> 00:24:58.962]  They said the United States has the power to cause harm and pain.
[00:24:59.082 --> 00:25:12.751]  Iran sent a statement meant for delivery at the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation board meeting in Vienna on Iran's refusal to freeze ultimatum on uranium enrichment.
[00:25:13.112 --> 00:25:15.793]  But the United States is also susceptible to harm and pain.
[00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:18.535]  So if that is the pain that the U.S.
[00:25:18.575 --> 00:25:21.097]  wishes to choose, let the ball roll.
[00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:25.441]  And if you go on, they were speaking of attacking Iran.
[00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:33.304]  But by the time it hits our newspapers, it's, oh, for going to the UN, they threatened us with pain.
[00:25:33.744 --> 00:25:36.245]  And no, the statement was, you've threatened us with pain.
[00:25:36.525 --> 00:25:37.666]  You can cause us pain.
[00:25:37.966 --> 00:25:40.307]  If you cause us pain, we'll cause you pain.
[00:25:40.547 --> 00:25:42.108]  So go ahead and let the ball roll.
[00:25:43.949 --> 00:25:50.872]  In statements for the same meeting, the United States said its European allies said Iran's intransigence
[00:25:51.619 --> 00:25:52.579]  And Scuttle said,
[00:26:17.503 --> 00:26:17.543]  So...
[00:26:37.675 --> 00:26:44.997]  The IAEA has said that yes, they found some documents at universities dealing with A-bombs from about a decade ago.
[00:26:45.237 --> 00:26:45.697]  Big deal.
[00:26:45.777 --> 00:26:46.897]  Every country has those.
[00:26:47.197 --> 00:26:52.378]  Yes, Iran in the past did have nuclear ambitions or atomic ambitions.
[00:26:52.758 --> 00:26:53.839]  What country doesn't?
[00:26:54.899 --> 00:26:56.939]  And so they let the IAEA in.
[00:26:57.159 --> 00:27:03.361]  The IAEA admitted no one ever gave them wider latitude in their investigations.
[00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:05.121]  No one was ever more wide open.
[00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.410]  I think?
[00:27:32.868 --> 00:27:33.909]  And they said, you know what?
[00:27:33.929 --> 00:27:36.091]  And they had a moderate in at the time in their government.
[00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:37.632]  They said, sure, we'll do that.
[00:27:38.552 --> 00:27:38.893]  Boom.
[00:27:40.354 --> 00:27:43.556]  Then a year and a half later, they go, okay, we're going to take the seals off.
[00:27:43.576 --> 00:27:45.938]  They go, nope, you can't do that with your nuclear weapons.
[00:27:46.338 --> 00:27:47.099]  They go, what do you mean?
[00:27:47.139 --> 00:27:48.159]  It's peaceful systems.
[00:27:48.179 --> 00:27:48.900]  You've said that.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:49.500]  Nukes!
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:49.801]  Nukes!
[00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:51.302]  They're removing nukes!
[00:27:52.042 --> 00:27:52.963]  They're taking them off!
[00:27:53.223 --> 00:27:54.164]  They're removing the seals!
[00:27:54.224 --> 00:27:54.444]  Nukes!
[00:27:54.504 --> 00:27:54.744]  Nukes!
[00:27:54.804 --> 00:27:56.646]  And the average American goes, huh?
[00:27:56.766 --> 00:27:57.126]  Nukes?
[00:27:57.546 --> 00:27:58.527]  Remove seals?
[00:27:58.567 --> 00:28:00.328]  That sounds like an episode of 24.
[00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:03.912]  Then the drum starts beating.
[00:28:03.952 --> 00:28:05.874]  We'll use many nukes on you, Iran.
[00:28:05.914 --> 00:28:06.654]  We'll attack you.
[00:28:06.694 --> 00:28:08.236]  We'll invade your southwest.
[00:28:08.296 --> 00:28:09.177]  We'll take over.
[00:28:09.677 --> 00:28:17.385]  And then a year ago, they tried to overthrow the country, attempted CIA coup with stage riots, bombings all over the country, clearly linked.
[00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:17.905]  The U.S.
[00:28:17.925 --> 00:28:19.547]  admits they've got special forces troops
[00:28:19.927 --> 00:28:20.548]  We're good to go.
[00:28:20.568 --> 00:28:20.928]  We're good to go.
[00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:34.752]  So that's what's going on.
[00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:37.714]  Imagine, you've got foreign troops running around blowing stuff up.
[00:28:38.054 --> 00:28:40.195]  You've got foreign troops trying to overthrow your country.
[00:28:40.435 --> 00:28:42.696]  You've got a foreign government staging riots.
[00:28:43.197 --> 00:28:45.938]  You've got dams being blown up and buildings being bombed.
[00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:49.580]  You've got troops, admittedly, in the country preparing for an attack.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.341]  Troops and ships and troop ships have moved into the area.
[00:28:52.641 --> 00:28:55.342]  Rumsfeld's openly talking about using mini-nukes on them.
[00:28:55.662 --> 00:29:02.706]  Americans, about half of them, are running around saying, "'Glass parking lot, nuke them,' and then grunting like cavemen mindlessly."
[00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:08.672]  And so Iran puts in a more hard-line government, and they say, okay, go ahead and attack us.
[00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:11.535]  We're going to attack you back, and then they're shocked that they may do that.
[00:29:11.876 --> 00:29:23.429]  Meanwhile, India says, we're not going to sign anything, and Bush says, okay, great, because you won't sign anything, and you won't let the UN in to see any of your military sites.
[00:29:24.089 --> 00:29:28.853]  If you'll let us have a few inspections of your peaceful sites, we'll give you even more hardware and more systems.
[00:29:28.893 --> 00:29:29.453]  How's that sound?
[00:29:29.814 --> 00:29:30.374]  Oh, great!
[00:29:30.754 --> 00:29:42.664]  Meanwhile, Pakistan, an Islamist state, is running around with nukes and selling them to everybody else, and North Korea's threatening to nuke us, China's threatening to nuke us, threatening to nuke us when they've got the weapons, and that isn't a problem!
[00:29:42.984 --> 00:29:44.105]  Iran's the problem!
[00:29:44.145 --> 00:29:48.948]  No, Iran's the problem because they're a bigger pushover than people like China and India.
[00:29:49.068 --> 00:29:49.569]  That's why...
[00:29:51.224 --> 00:29:52.127]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.629 --> 00:29:54.234]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.157 --> 00:29:57.845]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:53.482 --> 00:30:57.223]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:57.823 --> 00:30:59.664]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:02.125 --> 00:31:04.705]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:07.026]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:31:07.306 --> 00:31:16.929]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious problems?
[00:31:17.229 --> 00:31:19.550]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:32:00.658 --> 00:32:03.999]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:32:04.419 --> 00:32:08.581]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.

[00:32:46.599 --> 00:32:49.140]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.420]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.300]  All right, let me finish up my comments today.
[00:33:07.828 --> 00:33:09.309]  On the Iran situation.
[00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:10.970]  And we'll go to your calls.
[00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:18.514]  We've got a guest coming up who had chemical weapons tested on him at Borton Down Bio-Weapons and Chemical Weapons Laboratory in Wilshire, England.
[00:33:20.175 --> 00:33:24.777]  Before we do that, though, just listen to this ABC News clip and let's analyze this propaganda.
[00:33:25.117 --> 00:33:30.660]  But notice, Iran is responding to Bolton and others saying meaningful, painful consequences.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.422]  Then Bolton went on to say military strike.
[00:33:33.802 --> 00:33:35.503]  He said that two days ago on Monday.
[00:33:36.329 --> 00:33:39.491]  Okay, and so they're responding, going, oh, you'll have meaningful and painful?
[00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:42.633]  They just repeat back, okay, you'll have painful consequences.
[00:33:42.993 --> 00:33:47.115]  And then they spin it into, oh, there'll be painful sanctions.
[00:33:47.575 --> 00:33:51.958]  And then the president of Iran says, okay, well, it'll be painful what we do to you.
[00:33:52.178 --> 00:33:53.799]  And it's, can you believe what they said?
[00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:55.039]  But we said it to them.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.120]  And again, we use that psychology of we.
[00:33:57.381 --> 00:33:58.501]  We're not part of this system.
[00:33:58.521 --> 00:34:01.303]  We're being drug along by our hair, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:01.343 --> 00:34:01.703]  Remembered.
[00:34:02.347 --> 00:34:06.968]  That China is openly having press conferences where they have maps of 200 U.S.
[00:34:07.328 --> 00:34:09.889]  cities targeted, saying, we will kill you.
[00:34:10.009 --> 00:34:12.009]  Saying, quote, we will kill you.
[00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.310]  We will kill half your country.
[00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.071]  We will destroy 200 cities.
[00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:18.451]  We are aimed at you now.
[00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:19.691]  Back off.
[00:34:19.751 --> 00:34:20.612]  Do what we tell you.
[00:34:21.272 --> 00:34:22.772]  Oh, we love you, China.
[00:34:22.812 --> 00:34:23.612]  We love you.
[00:34:23.672 --> 00:34:25.213]  Meanwhile, Iran is 10...
[00:34:26.599 --> 00:34:38.527]  That assessment was a year ago, so I guess now, what, nine years and a few months, according to major CIA assessments, from having an A-bomb if they were left alone and allowed to buy thousands of centrifuges and do all this.
[00:34:38.887 --> 00:34:40.668]  Remember, the IAEA is certified.
[00:34:40.748 --> 00:34:44.671]  And understand that I'm even against what Iran did.
[00:34:45.151 --> 00:34:52.496]  Iran gave in to UN control, had the inspectors there for years, basically running their atomic program, controlling what they can do,
[00:34:53.524 --> 00:35:01.629]  Meanwhile, China, North Korea, South Africa for that matter, Israel, all these other countries do nothing.
[00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:05.452]  Many of them threaten us, and it's A-OK, and our own government allows U.S.
[00:35:05.512 --> 00:35:14.498]  companies and Swiss companies, and as usual, Rumsfeld was involved on the board of ABB, transferring the nuclear reactors to build A-bombs to North Korea.
[00:35:14.558 --> 00:35:15.199]  Check that out.
[00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:15.759]  That's admitted.
[00:35:16.978 --> 00:35:18.400]  But none of that's a problem.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:27.869]  No, let's go create another hoax, another mass fraud, and try to get the Iranians to strike back at us when the globalists attack them.
[00:35:29.251 --> 00:35:31.253]  The major casinos are almost never wrong.
[00:35:32.319 --> 00:35:33.960]  I've never seen them be wrong on politics.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:43.022]  And they got two to one odds that by March of next year, because the globalists tend to say they're going to attack in March of, say, 2002.
[00:35:43.283 --> 00:35:45.383]  They attack Iraq in 03, in March.
[00:35:45.683 --> 00:35:47.204]  They claim they're going to attack in March of 06.
[00:35:48.104 --> 00:35:48.784]  Then they attack in 07.
[00:35:49.645 --> 00:35:51.046]  That's what the bets are on.
[00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:57.970]  They'll have, war is imminent, war is imminent, we're going to attack, and then, boom, hit them a year after their claimed invasion date.
[00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:12.198]  Now, it may come next week, I don't know, but looking at the casinos, the casinos have even said, and it's spot on with my analysis, look, the casinos have got to get it right, folks, or they lose their hind ends.
[00:36:12.418 --> 00:36:13.399]  They're in the free markets.
[00:36:14.073 --> 00:36:26.008]  Okay, and the house always wins because the house isn't some poor schmuck out there eating a steak and drinking martinis, pumping their money into a blackjack board, or pumping their money into a craps table.
[00:36:26.648 --> 00:36:31.094]  They're sitting there running the scam, so they really know what's going on, and they're
[00:36:31.954 --> 00:36:36.076]  On the same page as I'm on with this attack coming in the next year.
[00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:39.317]  I've said, hey, people are saying it's going to be the 28th of this month.
[00:36:39.677 --> 00:36:40.198]  I don't know.
[00:36:40.718 --> 00:36:41.478]  That could happen.
[00:36:41.718 --> 00:36:49.582]  But I'll tell you this, 90 to nothing, and they're saying 2 to 1, but I'd give it 4 to 1, that they're going to attack Iran the next year.
[00:36:50.982 --> 00:36:58.045]  And unfortunately, there's probably going to be, I'd say 2 to 1, a major terrorist attack in the Western Hemisphere, probably in the U.S.
[00:36:58.105 --> 00:36:59.826]  or England, could be in Germany.
[00:37:00.951 --> 00:37:01.672]  Somewhere like that.
[00:37:01.932 --> 00:37:02.933]  It could be in Moscow.
[00:37:02.953 --> 00:37:03.294]  Who knows?
[00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:04.996]  A massive terror attack.
[00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.118]  I mean, something that makes 9-11 look small.
[00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:08.520]  Before that.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.382]  Probably about a month or two before.
[00:37:11.243 --> 00:37:13.445]  So just brace yourselves for all of that.
[00:37:13.966 --> 00:37:18.491]  Okay, let me play this ABC News clip and analyze it, and then we'll come back and take your calls.
[00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:19.872]  But just listen to this.
[00:37:20.173 --> 00:37:22.235]  And then at the end, listen to the doublespeak of Bush.
[00:37:22.902 --> 00:37:24.323]  Listen to the double speak of Bush.
[00:37:24.343 --> 00:37:27.304]  He says, it's ridiculous that we're making preparations to attack them.
[00:37:27.564 --> 00:37:31.406]  When the Pentagon's own reports were saying that, that's why it was in the press then.
[00:37:31.746 --> 00:37:36.869]  And Bush, cabinet minutes had gotten out where they were saying, we've got to attack them in the next two years.
[00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:42.012]  And so Bush says, oh, that's ridiculous, but all options are on the table.
[00:37:42.212 --> 00:37:42.912]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:37:43.897 --> 00:37:44.657]  Good morning, Claire.
[00:37:44.677 --> 00:37:45.117]  You're right.
[00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:48.098]  The war of words between the US and Iran is heating up.
[00:37:48.158 --> 00:37:57.180]  This morning, Iran's president issued a new threat against the US, saying America could feel harm and pain if sanctions are imposed on his country.
[00:37:59.021 --> 00:38:06.163]  From across the administration, increasingly loud and ominous warnings as Iran vows to press ahead with its nuclear program.
[00:38:06.503 --> 00:38:10.824]  The Iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course,
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.702]  The international community is prepared to impose meaningful consequences.
[00:38:16.062 --> 00:38:23.945]  If it continues down the path of international isolation, there will be tangible and painful consequences.
[00:38:24.445 --> 00:38:34.328]  The comments came amid reports that Russia was hoping to work out a compromise deal, allowing Iran to develop some nuclear material and avoid a clash at the UN Security Council.
[00:38:34.749 --> 00:38:38.310]  The chorus of opposition from the administration killed that proposal.
[00:38:38.965 --> 00:38:45.126]  Enrichment and reprocessing on Iranian soil is not acceptable because of the proliferation risk.
[00:38:45.627 --> 00:38:47.147]  Now Iran has a choice.
[00:38:47.427 --> 00:38:54.889]  Drop its nuclear ambitions or face the UN Security Council and an American president who made this warning a year ago.
[00:38:55.329 --> 00:39:00.690]  This notion that the United States is getting ready to attack Iran is simply ridiculous.
[00:39:03.211 --> 00:39:05.011]  Having said that, all options are on the table.
[00:39:06.741 --> 00:39:14.712]  And according to a new report this morning the Security Council will begin meeting about Iran next week though there is no timetable for action there.
[00:39:15.643 --> 00:39:19.846]  And then notice, right on time, France and Germany weren't going along.
[00:39:20.787 --> 00:39:23.489]  The election of Merkel comes in.
[00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.111]  There are stage riots.
[00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:35.218]  We proved that the flashpoint, the riots were begun, were stirred up by intelligence agencies in France.
[00:39:35.238 --> 00:39:38.321]  They then spread to 10 countries, or excuse me, 11 countries.
[00:39:40.003 --> 00:39:41.004]  Clearly stirred up.
[00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:45.811]  Then Neocon Papers published the Mohammed cartoons, which they manufactured.
[00:39:45.831 --> 00:39:49.737]  They had some of their other Muslim agents go and stage even other events.
[00:39:49.978 --> 00:39:52.942]  Then they said in the headlines, there's a controversy.
[00:39:53.283 --> 00:39:55.366]  They manufactured a controversy.
[00:39:55.866 --> 00:39:58.808]  And then so the snowball began.
[00:39:58.828 --> 00:40:02.150]  The Muslims picked up on it, played right into it.
[00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.392]  The images of burning embassies, oh, the evil Muslims.
[00:40:05.952 --> 00:40:13.897]  And overnight, Paris, France comes out, and Jacques Chirac says, you know what, we'll just go ahead and nuke Iran.
[00:40:13.917 --> 00:40:20.001]  I mean, they go from, oh, we love Iran, oh, we're all sweet and friendly.
[00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:21.802]  And again, Chirac was playing that whole thing.
[00:40:22.851 --> 00:40:25.753]  I mean, France runs a lot more of America than Americans do.
[00:40:25.773 --> 00:40:27.194]  That's such a joke.
[00:40:27.534 --> 00:40:35.519]  When you realize the big rich families in England and France are all married, inbred together, it's just a few families, and they own this country.
[00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:36.640]  It's all staged.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.001]  But they've got to give you the illusion of choice.
[00:40:39.081 --> 00:40:42.003]  Oh, America and Europe are in a fight together.
[00:40:42.103 --> 00:40:44.064]  Oh, now Europe's on America's side.
[00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:48.207]  It is totally and completely staged.
[00:40:49.392 --> 00:40:56.860]  I mean, I've read letters from one king to another 300 years ago going, oh, my subjects are causing problems and our economy is in a slump.
[00:40:57.281 --> 00:40:58.942]  My ministers say we need a war.
[00:40:59.503 --> 00:41:00.764]  Let's go ahead and have one.
[00:41:00.905 --> 00:41:01.786]  Okay, cousin.
[00:41:01.806 --> 00:41:03.688]  Then they just have these wars.
[00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:05.449]  They're really wars against the people.
[00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.211]  Do you understand that?
[00:41:07.492 --> 00:41:11.356]  Do you understand that that's what's going on here?
[00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:16.880]  And so the globalists attack Iran, and then Iran strikes back.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.640]  I wouldn't blame them.
[00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:22.544]  Or if it isn't a big enough strike back, there'll be some big event here.
[00:41:23.244 --> 00:41:40.938]  And, oh, see, we've got to invade them physically now, which the battle plans are not just hypothetical, but actual battle plans they're saying they want to execute are to take about 10% or more of the country there in the southwest area near Basra, which just so happens to have over half their oil reserves.
[00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:47.724]  You know, we have to have this as a security perimeter, because they were launching forays into the British-controlled sector.
[00:41:47.824 --> 00:41:56.711]  Of course, they'll take the oil wells that belonged to BP originally, before Mesodeck nationalised them in 1952, that sorry affair.
[00:41:59.867 --> 00:42:03.310]  Then we were forced to carry out terror attacks to blame it on him.
[00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:08.994]  And then we got the Slovakia, and they did a great job torturing and killing.
[00:42:09.034 --> 00:42:11.356]  And then, unfortunately, that was overthrown.
[00:42:11.936 --> 00:42:15.559]  We'll soon have it all easily underfoot there.
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:20.763]  Meanwhile, Pakistan and India and North Korea are proliferating weapons.
[00:42:21.084 --> 00:42:23.506]  China's proliferating and threatening to kill us, you understand.
[00:42:23.766 --> 00:42:25.187]  And that's not a problem.
[00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:27.306]  No!
[00:42:27.746 --> 00:42:34.773]  The problem is the evil Iranians that simply said, well, you're saying that you will cause us measurable pain.
[00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:41.239]  So we will cause you harm and pain back if you attack us.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.862]  Oh, can you believe they repeated it back at us?
[00:42:45.003 --> 00:42:50.909]  Again, it doesn't compute with a rational, sane person engaged in logic.
[00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:55.613]  Alright, I've done enough ranting on this subject.
[00:42:55.633 --> 00:42:57.554]  There's a lot of other news coming up after I take some calls.
[00:42:58.155 --> 00:43:00.837]  House for News, USA Patriot Act goes to be signed by Bush.
[00:43:01.357 --> 00:43:04.900]  Radically expanded, even worse than the original Patriot Act 2.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.281]  Just an absolute nightmare.
[00:43:07.262 --> 00:43:09.544]  You want Nazi Germany, you're getting it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:09.684 --> 00:43:12.106]  And the Internet tops TV, it's the most popular pastime.
[00:43:13.267 --> 00:43:15.689]  And we'll get into just a whole other stack of...
[00:43:18.863 --> 00:43:20.284]  Whole other stack of news here.
[00:43:20.344 --> 00:43:23.486]  Right now, let's go to Leo in California.
[00:43:23.526 --> 00:43:24.386]  Leo, you're on the air.
[00:43:24.586 --> 00:43:25.226]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:43:25.527 --> 00:43:25.787]  Hi.
[00:43:26.247 --> 00:43:28.368]  Yeah, first off, I want to laugh about that clip.
[00:43:28.408 --> 00:43:32.170]  It makes me think that we should give an Academy Award to these global actors.
[00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.711]  They're pretty good.
[00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:35.172]  Yeah, there's no plan to attack them.
[00:43:35.192 --> 00:43:35.932]  That's ridiculous.
[00:43:36.172 --> 00:43:40.255]  Yeah, this is a big, big stage, and people are buying into it, like they're buying into Madonna and all her garbage.
[00:43:41.195 --> 00:43:43.997]  The second thing I want to talk about is actually what I had for breakfast this morning.
[00:43:44.537 --> 00:43:45.758]  I had a bar of Cal Bend soap.
[00:43:47.128 --> 00:43:49.850]  I just want to tell you that's pretty good stuff there that you recommend.
[00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:52.272]  Doesn't it smell good, the bar soap?
[00:43:52.592 --> 00:43:53.032]  Oh, yeah.
[00:43:53.052 --> 00:43:54.353]  I wanted to eat it when I was taking a shower.
[00:43:54.373 --> 00:43:57.155]  I was like, man, this stuff's pretty good.
[00:43:57.175 --> 00:43:58.116]  You know, he's not kidding.
[00:43:58.356 --> 00:44:04.820]  It's like cocoa, coconut oil, and a bunch of other stuff.
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.161]  And almond oil.
[00:44:07.222 --> 00:44:08.382]  And that's just the bar soap.
[00:44:08.422 --> 00:44:09.703]  What did you get from Calvin Soap?
[00:44:09.924 --> 00:44:10.844]  I bought the $14 sample pack.
[00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:15.731]  But after that, me and my girlfriend talked about it and did the numbers.
[00:44:15.751 --> 00:44:22.517]  We're actually going to buy the five-year package because we will save 80% according to what we normally spend on regular stuff.
[00:44:22.617 --> 00:44:25.160]  Yeah, it's on average 85%, and that's not high.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.163]  They were organic before people even used that term.
[00:44:28.183 --> 00:44:28.163]  1947.
[00:44:28.383 --> 00:44:32.587]  And we only have the best sponsors here, and it's what I use.
[00:44:32.627 --> 00:44:33.728]  It's what the office uses.
[00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:35.169]  And, I mean, I have...
[00:44:36.303 --> 00:44:39.646]  You know, staff here at the office go, man, I kind of thought you were hyping that.
[00:44:39.826 --> 00:44:40.706]  That stuff's incredible.
[00:44:40.766 --> 00:44:41.127]  I love it.
[00:44:41.147 --> 00:44:42.167]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[00:44:42.307 --> 00:44:44.069]  I can't wait to get the five-year package.
[00:44:44.709 --> 00:44:45.550]  Wow, I don't get that.
[00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:46.611]  I get a yearly package.
[00:44:48.392 --> 00:44:50.133]  Well, you save even more on the five-year package.
[00:44:50.173 --> 00:44:53.336]  Plus, I'm going to pass it out to my family members and all that and get them going on that.
[00:44:53.476 --> 00:44:55.217]  Well, it's ridiculously inexpensive.
[00:44:55.877 --> 00:45:00.401]  There's a banner on Infowars.com on the left-hand side to CalvinPierceSub.com.
[00:45:00.681 --> 00:45:02.662]  And the second thing I wanted to talk about was just something real funny.
[00:45:02.742 --> 00:45:04.724]  I was listening to Coast to Coast last night and
[00:45:05.273 --> 00:45:10.274]  I thought about the jokes you make about people who say, oh, we've got to put all the Muslims in camps.
[00:45:10.894 --> 00:45:13.034]  And this guy called in, and he sounded pretty intelligent.
[00:45:13.854 --> 00:45:18.295]  And then he's like, yeah, we've got to get all the Muslims and racially profile them and throw them all in camps in Montana.
[00:45:18.955 --> 00:45:20.436]  And then George Norrie asked him why.
[00:45:20.456 --> 00:45:21.516]  And the guy said, well, I don't know.
[00:45:21.556 --> 00:45:22.276]  We've just got to do it.
[00:45:22.856 --> 00:45:24.836]  Because we got hit.
[00:45:24.876 --> 00:45:25.557]  We got hit!
[00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.137]  He said the exact same thing.
[00:45:28.197 --> 00:45:31.017]  And I was just really laughing about that.
[00:45:31.077 --> 00:45:32.618]  We've got to get them before they get us.
[00:45:33.018 --> 00:45:33.298]  Yeah.
[00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:37.095]  What did George Nornay say to that?
[00:45:37.115 --> 00:45:39.838]  He just kind of asked him a couple questions.
[00:45:39.879 --> 00:45:44.365]  I don't know exactly off the top of his head, but kind of shut him down and put him in his place and then cut him off.
[00:45:44.385 --> 00:45:47.089]  Yeah, George is the only big national super show...
[00:45:47.756 --> 00:45:58.500]  I mean, he's got the second biggest radio show in the country, conservatively, and he doesn't go off the deep end into neocon worship, which is very rare, and I appreciate him doing that.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.080]  He talks about world government quite often.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.981]  He has guests on there that actually bring it up quite frequently.
[00:46:02.001 --> 00:46:02.481]  No, I know.
[00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:04.962]  The direction he's taking the broadcast is great.
[00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:05.822]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:05.882 --> 00:46:06.602]  One more thing, Alex.
[00:46:06.682 --> 00:46:06.883]  Sure.
[00:46:06.903 --> 00:46:10.924]  I just wanted to ask you, I've been calling the local radio stations here to get your show on the air.
[00:46:11.677 --> 00:46:14.298]  If you can help me off the air or... Where are you in California?
[00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:15.618]  I'm in Bakersfield, California.
[00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:16.318]  Okay.
[00:46:16.639 --> 00:46:20.660]  I'm trying to get people here on... I know they're not owned by Clear Channel, so I got through that obstacle.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.500]  And I did try to call their program director twice.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.081]  He's never there.
[00:46:24.101 --> 00:46:25.041]  Now he's on his honeymoon.
[00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:27.982]  And they can't put me through to anybody, so I leave messages.
[00:46:28.122 --> 00:46:32.383]  And I'm trying to find out what's the most effective way to get you on air here locally.
[00:46:34.885 --> 00:46:37.270]  Start calling in on air during local shows.
[00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:38.653]  I did that earlier.
[00:46:38.693 --> 00:46:42.340]  I called this guy named Scott Cox earlier, but he kind of cut me off because I got into the New World Order.
[00:46:43.002 --> 00:46:44.703]  And then I got into some things like that.
[00:46:44.743 --> 00:46:52.228]  The way to do it is just get a hold of the program director or the general manager, send them a nice letter and say, hey, here's the website, GCNlive.com.
[00:46:52.408 --> 00:47:02.075]  They've got like 25 different programs, a wide variety of viewpoints and ideas, but it's alternative, and why don't you check it out to fill up any gaps you've got.
[00:47:02.535 --> 00:47:03.396]  Okay, that's how you do it.
[00:47:03.416 --> 00:47:04.136]  Thank you for the call.
[00:47:05.897 --> 00:47:09.860]  He brought up a point, and I wanted to comment on it, and I forgot what it was because he went on with another...
[00:47:10.495 --> 00:47:13.556]  With another question, but I appreciate you calling stations trying to get us on.
[00:47:13.576 --> 00:47:16.316]  Oh, you were raising the point about putting people in camps.
[00:47:16.776 --> 00:47:18.577]  I'm not joking about that when I say it.
[00:47:19.777 --> 00:47:28.399]  We had Michelle Malkin on, who poses as a conservative, she's not really, and she wrote a book called The Case for Camps, and how we need to put the Muslims in camps.
[00:47:29.879 --> 00:47:33.980]  And then there was, we went to a meeting called The New World Order.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.061]  It was a three-part meeting, and actually Kevin Smith, who works in my office,
[00:47:38.502 --> 00:47:39.102]  We're good to go.
[00:48:08.447 --> 00:48:10.748]  Well, number one, Arabs didn't attack us on 9-11.
[00:48:11.429 --> 00:48:16.092]  Number two, our government is selling out much of our infrastructure to, quote, Arab countries.
[00:48:16.512 --> 00:48:17.352]  And you're not worried about that.
[00:48:17.392 --> 00:48:27.398]  Put them all in camps, but let their chief executive officers run the Maritime Administration and let the people that sit on the federal boards that sign off on it get billions of dollars from them personally.
[00:48:27.979 --> 00:48:28.799]  It's no problem.
[00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:33.602]  It's just a mindless emotionalism introducing camps to the psyche.
[00:48:34.282 --> 00:48:35.383]  Camps equal safety.
[00:48:36.474 --> 00:48:37.074]  So don't worry.
[00:48:37.134 --> 00:48:38.355]  The Muslims aren't going to go to the camps.
[00:48:38.435 --> 00:48:40.856]  It's going to be gun owners and conservatives and landowners.
[00:48:40.916 --> 00:48:51.300]  Or if some local viceroy wants your wife or wants your business, or say some globalist has a car dealership and his brother's homeland security, you'll get arrested or quietly die on some lonely road.
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.941]  Your business will be repossessed.
[00:48:52.961 --> 00:48:54.262]  They'll claim you were funding al-Qaeda.
[00:48:54.502 --> 00:48:56.122]  I mean, that's what you've got to look forward to.
[00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:57.143]  That's what tyrannies do.
[00:48:58.346 --> 00:48:59.146]  They always do.
[00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.087]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts.
[00:49:01.147 --> 00:49:02.268]  It's a guarantee.
[00:49:02.288 --> 00:49:04.309]  You'll be like, but I serve the country.
[00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:06.810]  I stuck bumper stickers on my car for the troops.
[00:49:07.971 --> 00:49:10.712]  Well, look what they do to the troops with the depleted uranium.
[00:49:11.452 --> 00:49:12.653]  Look what they do to their servants.
[00:49:12.713 --> 00:49:14.214]  I mean, you thought you'd be safe?
[00:49:14.254 --> 00:49:17.615]  Just remember down the road if they win and you're enjoying all of this.
[00:49:20.096 --> 00:49:22.197]  Just remember I told you.
[00:49:23.278 --> 00:49:26.780]  So that's the whole atmosphere swirling around this.
[00:49:28.716 --> 00:49:32.118]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:49:32.998 --> 00:49:34.719]  Let's talk to Mark in Texas.
[00:49:34.779 --> 00:49:35.359]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.300]  Hello, Alex.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.041]  Calling from up the road, North Lamar.
[00:49:38.321 --> 00:49:38.581]  Yes.
[00:49:38.881 --> 00:49:41.323]  Got a few news stories I think you'll have interest in.
[00:49:41.403 --> 00:49:48.226]  First of all, yesterday, Karen Sunlightner, that vile worm, was defeated in the primary.
[00:49:48.246 --> 00:49:49.687]  I was going to talk about that later.
[00:49:49.727 --> 00:49:57.951]  She lost, but then people like Tom DeLay with polls, what, three-fourths against him, magically won.
[00:49:58.905 --> 00:50:00.586]  Well, at least she's gone at least for a while.
[00:50:01.646 --> 00:50:07.168]  And credit goes to the anti-Toll Road people such as yourself, so congratulations.
[00:50:07.929 --> 00:50:15.172]  The second thing, CNN has been running a story and repeating it this past week on the CitySearch implantable chip.
[00:50:15.932 --> 00:50:17.152]  And it's sort of a whitewash.
[00:50:17.212 --> 00:50:20.714]  The last sentence in the report goes sort of to this effect.
[00:50:22.374 --> 00:50:23.135]  Almost exact quote.
[00:50:23.915 --> 00:50:28.517]  They end the report saying, Like it or not, your boss may soon be literally under your skin.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.982]  So, that's what seems... You know, I heard a news report on that.
[00:50:33.942 --> 00:50:36.543]  Is that a text report or an audio or video?
[00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:41.825]  That was a video report done over about five minutes long.
[00:50:41.885 --> 00:50:42.726]  Can you do me a favor?
[00:50:42.746 --> 00:50:45.687]  Can you find it and email it to tips at infowars.com?
[00:50:46.067 --> 00:50:46.708]  I'll try to do that.
[00:50:46.748 --> 00:50:47.548]  I have one more story for you.
[00:50:47.568 --> 00:50:48.108]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:50:48.168 --> 00:50:48.548]  Stay there.
[00:50:48.648 --> 00:50:52.590]  But try to think of the exact headline, and I can probably find it right now.
[00:50:53.611 --> 00:50:54.211]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:56.552]  But I actually did hear a radio show play that.
[00:51:00.676 --> 00:51:05.023]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.223 --> 00:51:09.650]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:11.012]  There is a chance.
[00:51:12.088 --> 00:51:14.190]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:16.992]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:17.332 --> 00:51:21.555]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:21.615 --> 00:51:28.540]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.702]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:30.922 --> 00:51:41.389]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:41.669 --> 00:51:47.053]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:47.553 --> 00:51:50.215]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:08.461]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:08.722 --> 00:52:13.084]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.364 --> 00:52:22.289]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:26.131]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.411 --> 00:52:27.052]  We're good to go.
[00:52:27.072 --> 00:52:27.532]  We're good to go.

[00:53:46.275 --> 00:53:49.359]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:55.388]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:09.114 --> 00:54:20.358]  I remember a few weeks ago, we covered an article here on air with this company, CitySearch, that runs surveillance cameras, big brother company, and they're talking about making their employees all take chips, and a few have.
[00:54:20.378 --> 00:54:24.539]  It's a big gimmick, and yeah, it's just the endless headlines, endless PR.
[00:54:24.579 --> 00:54:26.480]  Hey, you may have to take a chip.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.760]  No, we're serious.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.881]  Hey, the Mexican Attorney General's making his employees take it.
[00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:32.061]  Hey, this company's doing it.
[00:54:32.601 --> 00:54:33.902]  Hey, you may have to do it.
[00:54:34.722 --> 00:54:37.103]  And I was listening to Power Hour this morning, driving along in the car,
[00:54:37.925 --> 00:54:40.127]  Here in Austin, another broadcast here on Genesis.
[00:54:40.587 --> 00:54:42.309]  And I heard them play a clip of that.
[00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:46.252]  In fact, don't you have that clip now that I think about it, Scott?
[00:54:48.253 --> 00:54:52.937]  Yeah, he just has the short little intro clip that they play from a similar news piece.
[00:54:53.117 --> 00:54:54.298]  Do you have that at hand?
[00:54:54.318 --> 00:54:55.679]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:54:57.039 --> 00:55:04.682]  Tonight's eye-opener, what would you do if your boss said you had to have a computer ID chip implanted under your skin or you'd be fired?
[00:55:05.162 --> 00:55:12.084]  Well, we're not there quite yet, but one Ohio company is doing something that has some people wondering if we're headed down that road.
[00:55:12.124 --> 00:55:15.505]  Here's correspondent Daniel Seberg with tonight's eye-opener.
[00:55:16.666 --> 00:55:17.926]  So, there you go.
[00:55:17.946 --> 00:55:19.467]  The listener mentions it.
[00:55:19.547 --> 00:55:20.107]  We've got it.
[00:55:20.737 --> 00:55:22.038]  And what's wrong with that?
[00:55:22.058 --> 00:55:23.279]  You're one of the weirdos.
[00:55:23.679 --> 00:55:26.901]  You know, you're one of the weirdos that caused the nuke attack of 2010.
[00:55:27.382 --> 00:55:29.243]  People like you, small-minded.
[00:55:29.523 --> 00:55:35.767]  You caused Al Qaeda to hit us hard and take out Chicago, to take out Dallas, to take out Cleveland, to take out Denver.
[00:55:36.408 --> 00:55:36.948]  And you know what?
[00:55:36.968 --> 00:55:39.590]  We put all of you in camps, too, after that attack happened.
[00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:40.991]  And now America's safe.
[00:55:41.031 --> 00:55:42.232]  Yeah, we're all forced drugged.
[00:55:44.297 --> 00:55:52.700]  See, once you're under the police state, you'll realize that all the baubles, all the trappings, all the peer pressure meant nothing, and freedom was everything.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.661]  Freedom caused the plenty we had in the streets.
[00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:57.721]  Let's not let it get to that point.
[00:55:58.302 --> 00:56:01.003]  Real fast, Mark in Texas, finish up what you were saying.
[00:56:01.503 --> 00:56:04.184]  Okay, yeah, one other news story from the Daily Texan on Monday.
[00:56:04.604 --> 00:56:07.525]  Travis County selected as test site for next census.
[00:56:08.343 --> 00:56:12.885]  The United States Census Bureau plans to hire more than 3,600 temporary part-time local workers.
[00:56:12.905 --> 00:56:14.825]  Let me guess, a yearly census?
[00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:16.206]  Yes.
[00:56:16.446 --> 00:56:17.006]  It wasn't hard.
[00:56:17.046 --> 00:56:17.726]  It was official in 2000.
[00:56:17.906 --> 00:56:28.230]  They said a yearly census, hundreds of questions, they'll threaten to arrest you, and then they plan to get it down to a monthly, and you'll just get these little questionnaires, and it's no more Fifth Amendment.
[00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.291]  It's all part of just answering government questions.
[00:56:30.551 --> 00:56:31.691]  How many guns do you own?
[00:56:31.711 --> 00:56:32.772]  What's in your bank account?
[00:56:33.012 --> 00:56:33.972]  What do your children eat?
[00:56:34.978 --> 00:56:35.620]  No, I'm sorry.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.605]  I didn't see the article, but just go ahead and tell me what it says.
[00:56:38.986 --> 00:56:39.287]  Okay.
[00:56:39.307 --> 00:56:41.050]  Well, that's pretty much what it says.
[00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:45.258]  The results of the 2006 census will help shape the format of the next regular census in 2010...
[00:56:46.371 --> 00:56:51.092]  Every resident of Travis County at least 18 years or older will receive the census in the mail starting in March.
[00:56:51.152 --> 00:56:51.512]  Let me guess.
[00:56:51.572 --> 00:56:54.012]  It says by law you've got to answer a total fraud.
[00:56:54.072 --> 00:56:54.853]  We took it to court.
[00:56:54.873 --> 00:56:56.193]  It's illegal.
[00:56:56.513 --> 00:57:00.114]  You don't have to answer any more questions on how many people are domiciled or live there.
[00:57:00.374 --> 00:57:01.094]  But they don't care.
[00:57:01.114 --> 00:57:03.474]  It doesn't matter if we have court rulings and it's the Fifth Amendment.
[00:57:03.834 --> 00:57:05.535]  You supposedly got to answer their questions.
[00:57:05.575 --> 00:57:07.275]  It's just more of a hoax.
[00:57:07.355 --> 00:57:08.155]  It's all a hoax.
[00:57:08.635 --> 00:57:09.255]  You're close.
[00:57:09.315 --> 00:57:13.216]  The next sentence is residents who don't return the survey will be visited by one of the new part-time...
[00:57:13.632 --> 00:57:21.641]  Census workers, and here's an interesting kicker, quote, it could be one of the most important pieces of mail that you will receive, unquote, that Austin Mayor will win.
[00:57:22.382 --> 00:57:23.423]  So that's that story.
[00:57:24.435 --> 00:57:25.656]  So all color of law.
[00:57:25.696 --> 00:57:26.737]  You've got to vaccinate.
[00:57:26.857 --> 00:57:27.317]  Lie.
[00:57:27.537 --> 00:57:28.698]  You've got to fill out the census.
[00:57:28.858 --> 00:57:29.399]  Lie.
[00:57:29.419 --> 00:57:31.921]  You know, just lie after lie.
[00:57:32.181 --> 00:57:33.362]  Mercury's good for you.
[00:57:33.462 --> 00:57:34.023]  Lie.
[00:57:35.004 --> 00:57:37.686]  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[00:57:37.966 --> 00:57:39.448]  Email me that Daily Texas story.
[00:57:39.488 --> 00:57:40.108]  I want to post that.
[00:57:40.509 --> 00:57:41.309]  All right, and one reminder.
[00:57:41.369 --> 00:57:47.395]  Remember when you go to the CIA website researching Mosaddegh, block all cookies because they'll put cookies on your computer.
[00:57:48.035 --> 00:57:48.476]  That's right.
[00:57:48.516 --> 00:57:49.897]  They really do Trojan horse you.
[00:57:50.707 --> 00:57:53.508]  Last time I was on their site, the computer all shut down and screwed up.
[00:57:53.548 --> 00:57:55.168]  But actually, what?
[00:57:55.228 --> 00:57:56.309]  They're the criminals, thank you.
[00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:58.749]  And they're not all criminals in there, but the criminals run it.
[00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:08.812]  And also, a lot of that stuff I mentioned a few weeks ago on their website where they admit they carry out terror attacks, we did print it off, we did screenshot it, it is going in the new film.
[00:58:09.353 --> 00:58:11.533]  A lot of that's being taken down or blocked.
[00:58:12.593 --> 00:58:14.194]  You go to it now and the links are dead.
[00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:18.360]  So they are definitely listening to the show.
[00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:19.561]  They're like, you idiot!
[00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:22.442]  I can just see them in the history department of the CIA.
[00:58:22.482 --> 00:58:23.343]  You moron!
[00:58:23.383 --> 00:58:24.183]  What did you do?
[00:58:24.503 --> 00:58:26.064]  I don't care if it's declassified!
[00:58:26.144 --> 00:58:26.984]  Get it off!
[00:58:27.385 --> 00:58:29.085]  That adds credibility to them!
[00:58:29.466 --> 00:58:30.846]  Get it off right now!
[00:58:31.386 --> 00:58:32.107]  Yes, sir!
[00:58:32.127 --> 00:58:35.208]  I shouldn't make fun of you.
[00:58:35.228 --> 00:58:36.129]  You're probably a good person.
[00:58:36.329 --> 00:58:37.189]  Probably listening right now.
[00:58:37.209 --> 00:58:37.789]  I'm sorry.
[00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:38.570]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:40.362 --> 00:58:45.204]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.244 --> 00:58:45.684]  Big Brother.
[00:58:45.724 --> 00:58:46.645]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:46.845 --> 00:58:51.087]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.307 --> 00:58:54.568]  You want answers?
[00:58:54.769 --> 00:58:56.229]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.035 --> 00:59:08.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.197 --> 00:59:13.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.439 --> 00:59:18.782]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, we're here live.
[00:59:18.822 --> 00:59:19.883]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:19.903 --> 00:59:23.084]  We've been talking about the war drums to attack Iran.
[00:59:23.344 --> 00:59:26.846]  Our government says, we'll attack you and cause you great pain.
[00:59:26.886 --> 00:59:28.707]  They say, okay, attack us, we'll cause you pain.
[00:59:28.767 --> 00:59:32.389]  And she uses a headline for hysteria, how they're threatening to cause us pain.
[00:59:32.729 --> 00:59:34.550]  How dare them repeat back what we said to them.
[00:59:35.623 --> 00:59:42.386]  Meanwhile, we've got big news here with the Patriot Act passing, now going to the President's desk here in the next few days.
[00:59:43.966 --> 00:59:46.067]  I guess Bush can click his heels when that happens.
[00:59:46.568 --> 00:59:52.150]  Coming up in the next segment throughout this hour, we will have open phones, Gordon Bell joins us.
[00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:57.192]  He was a Porton Down veteran who had chemical weapons tested on him at Porton Down.
[00:59:58.012 --> 00:59:59.593]  And we're doing this interview because...
[01:00:00.287 --> 01:00:00.467]  Hello?
[01:00:00.507 --> 01:00:00.707]  Hello?
[01:00:21.934 --> 01:00:22.294]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:22.614 --> 01:00:23.114]  It's Charles.
[01:00:23.634 --> 01:00:24.475]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:00:24.515 --> 01:00:25.555]  Charles in Louisiana.
[01:00:25.595 --> 01:00:26.175]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:00:26.235 --> 01:00:26.735]  I've got a news.
[01:00:26.895 --> 01:00:31.196]  Yesterday on the news, Channel 9 News, in California, they had a fella.
[01:00:31.216 --> 01:00:33.436]  He was stationed in Shreveport.
[01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.397]  The cop pulled him over.
[01:00:35.497 --> 01:00:37.377]  He had just come from Iraq.
[01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:39.758]  And a guy was filming it.
[01:00:39.778 --> 01:00:41.038]  The policeman didn't realize it.
[01:00:41.418 --> 01:00:42.698]  Told him, lay down on the ground.
[01:00:42.718 --> 01:00:43.579]  Then told him, get up.
[01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:45.239]  When the guy got up, he started shooting him.
[01:00:46.159 --> 01:00:47.319]  And this is one of our vets.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.500]  You know, the cops just shot him for nothing.
[01:00:51.822 --> 01:00:52.122]  Several times.
[01:00:52.142 --> 01:00:53.463]  But see, the vet is worthless.
[01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:59.107]  In Iraq, breathing DU, wearing deficient body armor, big scam, with Cheney and Bush involved.
[01:00:59.167 --> 01:01:01.008]  And then once they get here, they're even more scum.
[01:01:01.288 --> 01:01:07.052]  It's only for the people to hear in the news how great the troops are to fool more young people to join, sir.
[01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:07.733]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:08.093 --> 01:01:11.215]  Well, you see, I'm telling you, that's what they think about our vets.
[01:01:11.255 --> 01:01:12.636]  That's what our government does.
[01:01:13.176 --> 01:01:14.177]  We're worthless to them.
[01:01:15.404 --> 01:01:19.987]  Why did the Lord, the official, the authority, shoot the slave?
[01:01:20.868 --> 01:01:21.748]  Traffic violation.
[01:01:23.609 --> 01:01:26.571]  And so he said, lay down, and then later he got up, so he shot him.
[01:01:26.651 --> 01:01:27.952]  The policeman told him, get up.
[01:01:28.812 --> 01:01:33.195]  And he shot him several times, but they had somebody, a video on it.
[01:01:35.136 --> 01:01:39.758]  Well, you know, chances are that cop's probably a psychopath all screwed up from some previous war.
[01:01:39.818 --> 01:01:42.400]  Well, we've got thousands of them psychopaths.
[01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:46.110]  Well, if that's on your news, I'd like to get that posted.
[01:01:47.311 --> 01:01:47.972]  Give me a headline.
[01:01:47.992 --> 01:01:48.873]  Do you have a headline, Charles?
[01:01:48.893 --> 01:01:49.694]  No, it's not a headline.
[01:01:49.714 --> 01:01:50.935]  It was on Channel 2 News.
[01:01:51.835 --> 01:01:52.396]  Baton Rouge.
[01:01:52.896 --> 01:01:56.439]  Channel 2 News, Baton Rouge, Red Stick.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.221]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.423]  Okay, and then you know why it's called Baton Rouge?
[01:02:01.314 --> 01:02:01.434]  No.
[01:02:01.474 --> 01:02:03.276]  Because the Red Stick Indians live there.
[01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:04.577]  Oh, is that right?
[01:02:04.978 --> 01:02:06.039]  Yeah.
[01:02:06.219 --> 01:02:06.820]  Side issue.
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.402]  Now, let me, just some mindless trivia, sorry.
[01:02:09.983 --> 01:02:11.344]  That's terrible news, Charles.
[01:02:11.464 --> 01:02:12.565]  What are people saying about this?
[01:02:12.926 --> 01:02:16.489]  Well, I want to pass your tapes out this morning, every morning.
[01:02:16.509 --> 01:02:18.091]  I pass them out to run them off at night.
[01:02:19.723 --> 01:02:20.765]  They're so used to it.
[01:02:20.845 --> 01:02:22.687]  I mean, they're immune to all of this.
[01:02:22.927 --> 01:02:24.088]  They hear so much of it.
[01:02:24.429 --> 01:02:34.940]  Look, the other day, Kip Holden, the mayor of Baton Rouge, got on television and said, we're having a lot of racial tension here with the evacuees, and the police can't hold them.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.201]  They won't be able to hold them.
[01:02:36.221 --> 01:02:37.202]  They won't be able to hold out.
[01:02:37.683 --> 01:02:41.427]  The news media made him get back on the air and said, you insulted the policemen.
[01:02:43.488 --> 01:02:47.149]  You know, because there's so much that the police are treating evacuees so bad here.
[01:02:47.449 --> 01:02:50.430]  They're caging them, they're just pulling them, or they're talking bad to them.
[01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:58.652]  We had a policeman, a guy just broke a policeman's jaw here the other day, and a citizen come out and shot the man five times for the policeman.
[01:02:59.593 --> 01:03:10.056]  You know, the policeman shot him once, the guy got out the car and broke the policeman's jaw, got on him, and there was an auto zone, and another guy come out of his auto zone and shot the guy five times.
[01:03:11.505 --> 01:03:16.189]  Well, what type of... How dare that man not... He should have taken his shirt off and asked the officer to shoot him.
[01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:20.313]  Do you believe that you shoot somebody and then they fight back with their fist?
[01:03:20.573 --> 01:03:22.975]  That's pretty cowardly to fight with your fist against a gun.
[01:03:23.255 --> 01:03:25.457]  Well, he was using a lot of racial slurs.
[01:03:25.477 --> 01:03:28.260]  That's why the guy got out the car and started fighting him.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:28.740]  No, I understand.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.641]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:03:29.861 --> 01:03:30.182]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:32.804]  About taking... Wimps take on guns and fists.
[01:03:33.371 --> 01:03:33.691]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:33.711 --> 01:03:34.272]  Sir, I know.
[01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:39.996]  I mean, I don't live there, but I've been getting reports from you and others that it is just total breakdown of society, Charles.
[01:03:40.136 --> 01:03:40.516]  It is.
[01:03:40.556 --> 01:03:41.857]  It's about over for Louisiana.
[01:03:42.117 --> 01:03:42.858]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:42.898 --> 01:03:44.239]  We've got an important guest coming up.
[01:03:44.259 --> 01:03:44.699]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.423 --> 01:03:55.464]  The war on terrorism.
[01:03:55.784 --> 01:03:58.567]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:58.847 --> 01:04:02.991]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:03.432 --> 01:04:04.253]  So what do you do?
[01:04:04.573 --> 01:04:09.177]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:11.720]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:26.942]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:26.982 --> 01:04:34.049]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:34.449 --> 01:04:36.372]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:56.433]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:58.254]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:58.615 --> 01:05:03.279]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:05:03.639 --> 01:05:08.043]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:05:08.484 --> 01:05:12.688]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:05:12.888 --> 01:05:15.731]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:18.293]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:05:18.513 --> 01:05:25.080]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:32.528]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:05:32.808 --> 01:05:35.211]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:05:35.391 --> 01:05:37.113]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:05:52.583 --> 01:05:54.044]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:58.346]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[01:05:58.726 --> 01:06:02.248]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[01:06:02.628 --> 01:06:06.169]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:11.432]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[01:06:11.772 --> 01:06:17.556]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[01:06:17.876 --> 01:06:24.000]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:30.104]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[01:06:30.524 --> 01:06:31.705]  TriVortex is amazing.
[01:06:32.045 --> 01:06:33.146]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:33.246 --> 01:06:38.649]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[01:06:38.869 --> 01:06:42.312]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[01:06:42.592 --> 01:06:43.913]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[01:06:43.953 --> 01:06:44.233]  That's 619-884-1455.
[01:06:52.415 --> 01:06:57.479]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:00.161]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.181 --> 01:07:13.471]  The evil genius that he was, Joseph Stalin, Soviet dictator, said that when one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:07:13.491 --> 01:07:15.433]  When 10,000 die, it is a statistic.
[01:07:23.542 --> 01:07:31.566]  And so let me just first to introduce Porton Down to you and Project Shad and different programs that went on in the UK and the US.
[01:07:32.487 --> 01:07:37.429]  Let me introduce you to it with a story out of the BBC, August 1999.
[01:07:37.669 --> 01:07:42.952]  There's links to this up on Infowars.com today in the guest section.
[01:07:44.653 --> 01:07:46.994]  UK porting down a sinister heir.
[01:07:47.294 --> 01:07:50.236]  And then it gets into Ronald Madison saying,
[01:07:50.808 --> 01:07:52.289]  They told him he'd get some time off.
[01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:54.710]  They told him they were going to be testing a flu bug on him.
[01:07:55.611 --> 01:08:10.118]  They said, oh, if the young corporal just went in and we would volunteer for this and he'd get a three-day pass and two pounds, so a few dollars basically, that he'd be able to get some time off.
[01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:11.979]  They marched him into a chamber.
[01:08:12.099 --> 01:08:12.920]  They nerve gassed him.
[01:08:14.532 --> 01:08:16.375]  With a deadly nerve gas they knew would kill him.
[01:08:16.655 --> 01:08:18.097]  And then they dissected his body.
[01:08:18.297 --> 01:08:20.901]  And they told his parents that he just died of natural causes.
[01:08:21.702 --> 01:08:25.788]  And then his parents learned years later that they had dissected his body and done it on purpose.
[01:08:25.808 --> 01:08:27.850]  So you think the government loves you, folks.
[01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:29.132]  They will take you cops.
[01:08:29.172 --> 01:08:30.234]  They will take you military.
[01:08:30.254 --> 01:08:32.457]  And they'll kill you with pleasure.
[01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:37.464]  And Henry Kissinger's written about this and called you mindless scum to be used.
[01:08:37.844 --> 01:08:44.846]  David Rockefeller can write in the big Rockefeller Brothers Foundation educational documents about how we're all mindless scum.
[01:08:45.106 --> 01:08:51.649]  He can call us idiots, and I can read the quotes and give you links to, again, major organizations that they run where they say this.
[01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:55.771]  I mean, they publish books saying you're scum that slaves and laugh at you.
[01:08:55.811 --> 01:08:57.151]  I mean, because they know you're not going to read it.
[01:08:58.211 --> 01:09:00.492]  They know you hear people like me warning you, and you're not going to take heed.
[01:09:00.512 --> 01:09:01.773]  You're just going to love it.
[01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:03.526]  We're good to go.
[01:09:03.546 --> 01:09:04.027]  We're good to go.
[01:09:30.943 --> 01:09:36.724]  To see what the effects of the unnamed pathogen were, deaths resulted to tells remain classified.
[01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:43.366]  And last year they sprayed bacteria all over Oklahoma, and they admitted that was some teleclubogy.
[01:09:43.606 --> 01:09:48.307]  They said it causes death in mammals and the old, young, infirm, and spontaneous abortions.
[01:09:48.327 --> 01:09:51.687]  But they sprayed, what was it, five tons of it in the different tests.
[01:09:52.047 --> 01:09:54.968]  Every major town and city was sprayed repeatedly for a year straight.
[01:09:55.746 --> 01:09:58.287]  And, you know, that's just in the mainstream papers.
[01:09:58.347 --> 01:09:59.928]  It's, oh, we're spraying bacteria on you.
[01:10:00.308 --> 01:10:01.209]  This is very good for you.
[01:10:02.089 --> 01:10:14.255]  And there have been thousands and thousands of these tests, and they use DU all over the world, and improving grounds, and their own documents say it's going to kill the troops and cause massive deformities, and major testing sites overseas are picking it up, blowing it into the U.S.
[01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:15.915]  and England, and no one seems to care.
[01:10:15.995 --> 01:10:16.996]  Oh, DU is good for you.
[01:10:18.654 --> 01:10:24.277]  But instead of giving you all the background on what's happening to you and who's running things, I just thought I'd mention this one guy.
[01:10:24.317 --> 01:10:25.238]  He's dead now.
[01:10:25.698 --> 01:10:26.638]  Ronald Madison.
[01:10:27.519 --> 01:10:28.319]  And that was way back in 1953.
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:32.642]  They just marched him into a chamber and nerve-gassed him, killed him, murdered him.
[01:10:33.002 --> 01:10:33.702]  Nice young man.
[01:10:33.922 --> 01:10:34.883]  Big future ahead of him.
[01:10:34.903 --> 01:10:35.263]  Killed him.
[01:10:35.923 --> 01:10:36.644]  Knowing they'd kill him.
[01:10:37.264 --> 01:10:40.886]  And it's sort of going public because of people like Gordon Bell.
[01:10:40.926 --> 01:10:42.727]  And we can read a little article he put together for us.
[01:10:43.391 --> 01:10:45.733]  And we read about him in mainstream news reports until we got him on.
[01:10:45.753 --> 01:10:46.573]  We're honored to have him.
[01:10:47.214 --> 01:10:48.855]  And he was also one of these guinea pigs.
[01:10:48.895 --> 01:10:51.396]  We've interviewed many other sailors and soldiers from the U.S.
[01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:54.298]  who they'd go out on the ship and they'd spray them with nerve gas.
[01:10:54.318 --> 01:10:55.339]  People would die on the spot.
[01:10:55.379 --> 01:10:56.340]  People would die a week later.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.380]  People would die a year later.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.981]  All your hair would fall out.
[01:10:59.582 --> 01:11:01.643]  The officers would all don gas masks.
[01:11:02.043 --> 01:11:04.825]  And then when the ship would come back into harbor, everyone wouldn't touch it.
[01:11:04.965 --> 01:11:07.747]  Other ships would moor next to it.
[01:11:08.828 --> 01:11:08.948]  And...
[01:11:10.236 --> 01:11:13.240]  One of the latest cases was in 1984 in southern England.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:13.840]  They had U.S.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:18.787]  and British troops stand on their army tanks and they flew over and sprayed chemical and biologicals on them.
[01:11:18.827 --> 01:11:21.290]  It's just part of freedom, folks.
[01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:23.153]  It's a loving government killing its own troops.
[01:11:24.449 --> 01:11:27.230]  Man, again, I'm unpatriotic for even talking about it, so I apologize.
[01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:28.250]  Nerve-gassing them is good.
[01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:35.632]  Of course, I shouldn't be sickeningly sarcastic in a dark, satirical way, like Kurt Vonnegut has been, because some people will take it serious.
[01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:37.673]  And we have somebody who's been through living hell.
[01:11:37.713 --> 01:11:40.573]  We posted photos of him and what this stuff did to him.
[01:11:40.614 --> 01:11:43.594]  But Gordon Bell is a hero because he went public.
[01:11:43.654 --> 01:11:44.695]  He reported to police.
[01:11:45.015 --> 01:11:47.155]  He ferreted it out despite the threats.
[01:11:47.575 --> 01:11:49.956]  They killed the head of Porton Down Bio-Weapons Lab, by the way.
[01:11:50.596 --> 01:11:51.917]  Killed Dr. Kelly, that's clear.
[01:11:52.437 --> 01:11:53.397]  We'll talk about that, too.
[01:11:54.827 --> 01:12:01.290]  But he went public, and so he's a hero showing what one person can do, exposing this.
[01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:05.591]  And so, Gordon Bell, thank you for holding during that babbling diatribe.
[01:12:05.891 --> 01:12:07.212]  Good to have you on with us, sir.
[01:12:07.612 --> 01:12:08.252]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:09.073 --> 01:12:10.313]  Good morning to all you listeners.
[01:12:10.613 --> 01:12:10.953]  You bet.
[01:12:11.214 --> 01:12:12.354]  Are you on a speakerphone?
[01:12:15.055 --> 01:12:15.595]  No, I'm not.
[01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.836]  Okay, guys, can you boost his audio to me, please?
[01:12:19.097 --> 01:12:20.117]  Is that better?
[01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:21.898]  That's a lot better, Gordon.
[01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:22.158]  Okay.
[01:12:22.904 --> 01:12:30.730]  Gordon, tell us a little bit about yourself, where you reside, what happened to you at Porton Down, what Porton Down is.
[01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:32.932]  Well, presently I reside in Canada.
[01:12:32.992 --> 01:12:35.974]  I've lived here now for 30-odd years.
[01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:39.897]  But my story with Porton Down goes back to 1959.
[01:12:41.778 --> 01:12:52.226]  When I was an RAF serviceman, I was a radar operator, and I responded to a notice on the notice board in my
[01:12:53.823 --> 01:12:59.045]  Asking for volunteers to take part in Common Cold Research Tests.
[01:13:01.045 --> 01:13:05.567]  I subsequently volunteered and I was sent to Porton Down.
[01:13:07.468 --> 01:13:21.634]  Now, I went there on three occasions and on one visit I made to England I discovered that there was no such thing as Common Cold Tests ever having been carried out at Porton Down.
[01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:27.853]  So this really alarmed me because that's what I volunteered for.
[01:13:28.933 --> 01:13:32.955]  By the way, when I was in Porton Down, they gave me gas tests.
[01:13:33.635 --> 01:13:35.856]  They put substances on my forearm.
[01:13:36.877 --> 01:13:39.278]  They injected me with substances.
[01:13:39.638 --> 01:13:41.619]  You know, there was others with me as well.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:50.804]  In the hospital in Porton Down, we were put to bed with vital signs taken after injection.
[01:13:55.992 --> 01:14:06.561]  Sir, can you get right up on your telephone for me?
[01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:08.123]  Can you put the telephone up by your face?
[01:14:08.183 --> 01:14:08.643]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:08.803 --> 01:14:09.544]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:14:10.164 --> 01:14:11.225]  Yes, is that better?
[01:14:11.445 --> 01:14:12.306]  Yeah, that's a lot better.
[01:14:12.506 --> 01:14:14.488]  Maybe it's just on my end, but your audio's real low.
[01:14:14.828 --> 01:14:15.549]  Yeah, okay.
[01:14:15.589 --> 01:14:16.189]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:17.911]  Well, um...
[01:14:18.852 --> 01:14:35.057]  I began making enquiries with the Ministry of Defence and I wrote to the Minister asking for an explanation as to why I ended up at Porton Down when I had volunteered for common cold research tests that had never taken place.
[01:14:35.077 --> 01:14:37.178]  That was in 1996.
[01:14:37.278 --> 01:14:37.758]  I was informed
[01:14:42.401 --> 01:14:54.451]  Later by porting down that I had indeed been there in 1960 and I was subjected to various chemical warfare agents.
[01:14:56.833 --> 01:15:07.162]  They described them as being rubber mixers that were put on the arm for a short period of time which was supposedly a test for gas mask rubber.
[01:15:08.703 --> 01:15:10.605]  This is what they're telling me, right?
[01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:24.275]  They also put me in a gas chamber to do certain gas tests, which they now say was CS gas, with additives added.
[01:15:24.315 --> 01:15:37.687]  They then gave me a biological substance named Pyrexol, which is a lipopolysaccharide and is derived from the Salmonella bacterium.
[01:15:39.205 --> 01:15:43.987]  And it has serious effects on the human body.
[01:15:44.107 --> 01:15:46.388]  So not only chemical, but biological?
[01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:47.409]  Biological, yes.
[01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:50.410]  Were you familiar, sir?
[01:15:50.931 --> 01:15:57.874]  I mean, when did you begin to learn about the cases of other individuals, like Ronald Madison, who they'd knowingly murdered?
[01:15:58.214 --> 01:16:01.075]  I brought about the Madison inquest, you see.
[01:16:01.255 --> 01:16:06.598]  They held a secret inquest into his death in 1953, and it was all covered up.
[01:16:07.921 --> 01:16:14.783]  And I made enquiries to the Defence Minister asking for more details on this secret inquest.
[01:16:16.143 --> 01:16:19.804]  And I did this through my MP in England.
[01:16:20.044 --> 01:16:21.184]  That's your Member of Parliament?
[01:16:21.484 --> 01:16:21.784]  Yes.
[01:16:22.024 --> 01:16:30.406]  And you're credited with one of the people in more modern days really breaking this story open because you went and then reported it to the police, correct?
[01:16:30.446 --> 01:16:32.067]  I did report it to the police, yeah.
[01:16:32.327 --> 01:16:36.768]  Because they'd done these experiments without the consent
[01:16:38.007 --> 01:16:40.880]  without the informed consent of the individuals
[01:16:43.036 --> 01:16:50.462]  They duped them into taking part in tests that were supposedly for common cold, and they were not for common cold at all.
[01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:51.824]  Again, common cold or the flu.
[01:16:51.864 --> 01:16:53.445]  That's what they told Ronald Madison.
[01:16:53.485 --> 01:17:01.251]  They said, you're going to get three days off and $2 or $2 pounds, I guess $4 equivalent today if you do this.
[01:17:01.411 --> 01:17:05.275]  And then they took him in a chamber and nerve gassed him and then dissected his body.
[01:17:06.075 --> 01:17:07.677]  I mean, I want to go through your story, sir.
[01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:07.977]  Yes.
[01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:17.202]  But, I mean, just the psychology of this, can you kind of give us a condensed version for those that just joined us of what you then discovered really was going on?
[01:17:17.222 --> 01:17:25.127]  Well, there was a leaked document ended up in my MP's office, and it ended up in my file, right?
[01:17:25.747 --> 01:17:32.091]  And I received from the Minister of Defense at the time a letter on the 3rd of December, 1998.
[01:17:32.251 --> 01:17:32.872]  It was addressed.
[01:17:36.174 --> 01:17:39.116]  To my MP, but it was meant for me.
[01:17:39.136 --> 01:17:40.536]  Right?
[01:17:41.177 --> 01:17:51.242]  And in the letter he said, the minister said he was enclosing copies of the findings of the two main investigations which followed the death of Madison.
[01:17:53.763 --> 01:18:03.147]  And the MP sent me the letter, but he didn't send me the enclosures, you know, the copies of the findings.
[01:18:03.247 --> 01:18:04.248]  He kept them quiet.
[01:18:05.794 --> 01:18:15.761]  So several attempts to get him to just give me these copies that the minister had forwarded, just was met with silence.
[01:18:16.241 --> 01:18:17.702]  It was ignored.
[01:18:18.883 --> 01:18:19.563]  So, why not?
[01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:26.188]  To cut a long story short, my wife went down to the MP's office
[01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:36.271]  Tell you what, we're going to do some audio issues here.
[01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:37.031]  We're going to go to break.
[01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:38.792]  We're going to come back with our guest.
[01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:40.434]  And then we're going to continue.
[01:18:40.494 --> 01:18:42.855]  And then we're going to go through what really goes on at Porton Down.
[01:18:43.836 --> 01:18:46.798]  Governments knowingly murdering their own citizens.
[01:18:47.178 --> 01:18:48.899]  Murdering members of their own military.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:50.340]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.434]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[01:21:16.627 --> 01:21:20.190]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:23.672]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:21:23.952 --> 01:21:27.475]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:21:27.655 --> 01:21:31.118]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:21:31.258 --> 01:21:32.519]  I'm really amazed.
[01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:38.523]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:21:38.663 --> 01:21:41.065]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.

[01:21:54.572 --> 01:21:56.253]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:56.813 --> 01:21:58.574]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:21:59.741 --> 01:22:07.629]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:07.869 --> 01:22:10.511]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:22:10.471 --> 01:22:11.893]  's patented methodology.
[01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:19.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:22.243]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:23.083]  We're good to go.
[01:22:57.452 --> 01:22:59.374]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:59.855 --> 01:23:02.678]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:17.454]  Basically, my friends, they test on rats, they test on guinea pigs, they test on bunnies, rabbits, they test on monkeys, chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, lemurs.
[01:23:18.058 --> 01:23:18.878]  We're good to go.
[01:23:43.826 --> 01:23:45.407]  These are vitamins for your baby.
[01:23:45.908 --> 01:23:48.990]  And they knew that in 24, 48 hours it would cause a violent miscarriage.
[01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:53.534]  They'd be there with film cameras to film it when she came in to see what radiation would do.
[01:23:53.974 --> 01:23:56.156]  And their excuse was, we're fighting the Ruskies.
[01:23:56.176 --> 01:23:56.896]  We've got to do this.
[01:23:57.196 --> 01:23:58.517]  See, that's declassified.
[01:23:59.078 --> 01:24:04.042]  And see, that goes to the mindset of the globalists, the people running our country, running England.
[01:24:04.422 --> 01:24:05.283]  Remember Israel.
[01:24:05.343 --> 01:24:07.404]  It's now been in major Jewish newspapers in Israel.
[01:24:07.424 --> 01:24:12.248]  They took 110,000 Jewish children, Sephardic, of course.
[01:24:12.268 --> 01:24:13.489]  It was the Ashkenazi killing them.
[01:24:14.361 --> 01:24:22.765]  And they took these Sephardi, and they told him you're going to get a dental appointment, you're going to get a doctor's checkup for ringworm, and they radiated him, and then he died on the table, and then he died a week later.
[01:24:22.805 --> 01:24:24.486]  Some are still alive today of the 110,000.
[01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:26.187]  And the U.S.
[01:24:26.707 --> 01:24:28.809]  government paid $3 billion to have that done.
[01:24:28.909 --> 01:24:30.229]  So this is what they do.
[01:24:30.269 --> 01:24:35.392]  And we're working on getting one of the few ringworm survivors on here, because they're called ringworm children.
[01:24:36.329 --> 01:24:42.885]  They tell them, you're going to get a chick up for a ringworm, which is a fungus, and then they just burn their little brains.
[01:24:43.587 --> 01:24:44.309]  Why do they do it?
[01:24:44.349 --> 01:24:44.610]  Hey!
[01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:47.491]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[01:24:47.611 --> 01:24:48.111]  Very evil.
[01:24:48.471 --> 01:24:51.793]  But going back to Mr. Bell, and I apologize earlier, my audio was low.
[01:24:52.313 --> 01:24:54.254]  I know you, the listeners, could hear me, and that's good news.
[01:24:54.815 --> 01:24:57.036]  Mr. Bell, I really want to thank you for joining us.
[01:24:57.076 --> 01:25:09.502]  In the few minutes we've got left in this quick segment, your wife went down there to complain there at the local MP's office, and I guess one of the staffers ended up giving you more than you've gotten in the past of these classified documents.
[01:25:09.763 --> 01:25:10.543]  Please tell us more.
[01:25:10.783 --> 01:25:11.844]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:25:11.904 --> 01:25:20.428]  And the documents she obtained was the secret inquest of inquiry that was held after Madison was killed with sarin.
[01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:27.692]  And it's quite shocking, actually, because they were dripping this stuff through clothing.
[01:25:28.777 --> 01:25:29.817]  Tape to his arm.
[01:25:30.197 --> 01:25:44.362]  They administer 200 milligrams of sarin through clothing taped to his arm to test, in a test to determine how much sarin it would take to penetrate an army uniform.
[01:25:45.436 --> 01:25:46.657]  And they knowingly knew.
[01:25:47.617 --> 01:25:48.798]  They knew that, yes.
[01:25:49.098 --> 01:25:51.739]  One drop of sarin, and these documents are now released.
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.021]  These documents were leaked.
[01:25:55.421 --> 01:25:56.381]  They were not released.
[01:25:56.461 --> 01:25:58.082]  They were leaked by somebody.
[01:25:58.102 --> 01:26:03.345]  Well, I understand that, but I have the BBC here from 1999 now saying release.
[01:26:03.905 --> 01:26:07.547]  Yeah, well, that's incorrect, because they were still classified.
[01:26:08.234 --> 01:26:12.640]  But to get an idea of this, and I mean, thanks to you checking into your own case, you found out about this.
[01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:18.307]  Imagine knowing that a drop of this nerve gas will kill you, and they knew they were going to kill him.
[01:26:18.768 --> 01:26:21.572]  But Alex, they were using much worse than sound.
[01:26:21.752 --> 01:26:22.773]  They were using VX.
[01:26:24.108 --> 01:26:26.571]  They developed VX at Porton Down.
[01:26:26.591 --> 01:26:28.692]  That's their development.
[01:26:28.973 --> 01:26:31.735]  And for those that don't know, tell us about VX even more deadly.
[01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:35.499]  VX is a persistent nerve agent, right?
[01:26:35.559 --> 01:26:40.784]  It has an oily substance and it does not evaporate like normal sarin does.
[01:26:41.584 --> 01:26:41.645]  No.
[01:26:41.665 --> 01:26:41.705]  No.
[01:27:00.001 --> 01:27:11.165]  I have technical papers here, you know, that was given to me by Porton Down, that explain the inhalation phase of an experiment involving BX.
[01:27:11.285 --> 01:27:13.505]  Now what all did you specifically have tested on you?
[01:27:13.545 --> 01:27:15.026]  You said chemical and biological.
[01:27:15.086 --> 01:27:20.567]  Yes, one biological agent was a derivative of the Salmonella bacterium.
[01:27:20.587 --> 01:27:25.229]  It is known as Lipopolysaccharide.
[01:27:26.614 --> 01:27:34.440]  And lipopolysaccharide has many curious effects in that it does not give an immune response.
[01:27:35.601 --> 01:27:39.063]  In other words, your body does not react to it.
[01:27:40.024 --> 01:27:50.331]  And I'm finding now that this biological agent, pyrexol, was added to CS gas as a delivery agent.
[01:27:51.672 --> 01:27:53.594]  Now, CS gas was developed...
[01:27:54.565 --> 01:27:55.466]  You know what?
[01:27:55.486 --> 01:28:06.034]  We're about to break, but did you know that some of the tests and some of the findings have shown that police have been using VX?
[01:28:16.029 --> 01:28:21.573]  On protesters, and then scientists look at it and claim that there's evidence of bioweapons in it.
[01:28:21.974 --> 01:28:25.216]  Well, I can rest assured that that is correct.
[01:28:25.656 --> 01:28:26.857]  Oh, see, I pooh-poohed that.
[01:28:26.877 --> 01:28:27.417]  I didn't know that.
[01:28:27.658 --> 01:28:33.882]  You mean they're mixing chemical and bioweapons, serving it out to local police departments, and the dumb cops don't even know it.
[01:28:33.922 --> 01:28:34.943]  I'm sure it's hurting them, too.
[01:28:35.323 --> 01:28:36.224]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:36.304 --> 01:28:37.044]  Stay with us.
[01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:40.447]  An amazing interview with Gordon Bell, a hero.
[01:28:40.467 --> 01:28:40.907]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.132 --> 01:28:44.252]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.532 --> 01:28:46.193]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.253 --> 01:28:49.833]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.674 --> 01:28:56.675]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:28:57.035 --> 01:29:05.837]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:29:06.177 --> 01:29:10.838]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:29:11.318 --> 01:29:18.043]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:29:18.424 --> 01:29:30.193]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:29:30.693 --> 01:29:35.159]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:29:35.319 --> 01:29:37.641]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:29:37.661 --> 01:29:39.624]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:29:39.644 --> 01:29:40.845]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:29:40.925 --> 01:29:42.387]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:29:42.407 --> 01:29:43.448]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:56.333]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[01:29:56.773 --> 01:30:00.936]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[01:30:01.456 --> 01:30:08.842]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[01:30:09.264 --> 01:30:13.245]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[01:30:13.646 --> 01:30:27.051]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[01:30:27.511 --> 01:30:30.912]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhancement.
[01:30:31.272 --> 01:30:35.517]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[01:30:35.877 --> 01:30:38.800]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[01:30:38.961 --> 01:30:42.264]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[01:30:42.324 --> 01:30:43.826]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[01:30:53.556 --> 01:30:59.918]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.138 --> 01:31:05.160]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:13.383]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.523 --> 01:31:20.565]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:20.785 --> 01:31:22.006]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:22.146 --> 01:31:25.529]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:25.589 --> 01:31:28.291]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:28.491 --> 01:31:35.316]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:35.436 --> 01:31:37.878]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:38.058 --> 01:31:40.981]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:41.041]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.061 --> 01:31:42.022]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:53.064 --> 01:31:54.165]  We're good to go.
[01:32:08.937 --> 01:32:11.461]  I've photos of the tumors and rashes that it's caused.
[01:32:12.061 --> 01:32:14.925]  And understand, thousands of people went through Porton Down over the years.
[01:32:15.466 --> 01:32:17.970]  I've got articles right here, and that much is admitted.
[01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:22.115]  And then, strangely enough, the former head of the Porton Down Bio-Weapons Laboratory...
[01:32:24.810 --> 01:32:32.495]  Dr. David Kelly told American and British colleagues that, quote, I'm going to be killed if I don't shut up about what I know.
[01:32:32.835 --> 01:32:34.196]  I'll be found dead in the woods.
[01:32:34.216 --> 01:32:38.019]  And the local police saw men in black uniforms and masks.
[01:32:38.059 --> 01:32:39.420]  This is mainstream British news.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:41.141]  Run away from the body.
[01:32:41.481 --> 01:32:42.982]  There's almost no blood at the scene.
[01:32:43.082 --> 01:32:45.383]  Two undigested pills in his stomach.
[01:32:45.744 --> 01:32:47.405]  They claim he took pills and slit his wrist.
[01:32:48.826 --> 01:32:50.606]  But, I mean, clearly murdered.
[01:32:50.886 --> 01:32:55.869]  And in major polls, the majority of Brits believe that Dr. David Kelly was murdered.
[01:32:55.909 --> 01:33:00.611]  So I'll just pop that question to our guest in just a minute or two when we go back to him.
[01:33:00.631 --> 01:33:03.872]  And there's so many facets to this, I'm sorry we're having to rush him through it.
[01:33:04.633 --> 01:33:09.075]  But before we go back to our guest, I have made 14 documentaries.
[01:33:10.499 --> 01:33:16.404]  And the two newest, one is the Order of Death, showing how sick our leaders are and what they're really into, their occult activities.
[01:33:16.864 --> 01:33:20.107]  And the other is Martial Law 911, Rise of the Police State.
[01:33:20.507 --> 01:33:25.731]  And believe me, folks, governments that do this to their own troops, they're behind the terror attacks as well.
[01:33:25.791 --> 01:33:27.112]  We have all the evidence of that.
[01:33:27.152 --> 01:33:30.855]  We prove how they did it, why they did it, their own documents, their own admissions.
[01:33:31.235 --> 01:33:31.615]  We're good to go.
[01:33:31.635 --> 01:33:31.855]  I think?
[01:33:54.204 --> 01:33:57.326]  We're selling them at cost, right above cost for us.
[01:33:58.246 --> 01:34:01.788]  And it goes through how juries, grand juries, are really supposed to operate and so much more.
[01:34:02.128 --> 01:34:04.029]  So that's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:06.371]  Or again, go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:09.392]  We've got a deal going for the rest of March, a spring special.
[01:34:09.772 --> 01:34:15.235]  Five plus months, almost half a year free on the yearly membership when you sign up for a year.
[01:34:15.576 --> 01:34:17.136]  Then we have the good old $5.95 monthly membership.
[01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:19.369]  We're good to go.
[01:34:48.025 --> 01:34:50.808]  Well, the first thing about these tests are that they violated the Nuremberg Code.
[01:35:10.632 --> 01:35:21.841]  Now, the Nuremberg Code was made up, you know, just after the war, on the trial of Nazi doctors who were conducting human experiments, and they drew up this Nuremberg Code.
[01:35:22.381 --> 01:35:31.428]  And number one in the Code is that the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.
[01:35:31.989 --> 01:35:33.550]  That is number one of the Code.
[01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:35.812]  They totally violated that.
[01:35:37.794 --> 01:35:43.477]  The act that is on the court was not never a matter of consequence.
[01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:48.841]  That the subject should have the legal capacity to consent.
[01:35:50.082 --> 01:35:55.185]  That the subject should not be under the realms of any coercion.
[01:35:56.086 --> 01:36:04.191]  You see, they got us to Porton Down by offering us extra money for each experiment and extra leave.
[01:36:05.151 --> 01:36:09.654]  Now, this is coercion, and this goes against the Nuremberg Code.
[01:36:11.035 --> 01:36:18.940]  Now, sir, in your case, as with others who they killed, they told you it was the common cold or a flu test, correct?
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:19.980]  That is correct.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.485]  They also lied to you, and I want to remind people that tens of thousands of Nazis were brought into the UK and the US.
[01:36:26.625 --> 01:36:27.045]  Absolutely.
[01:36:27.205 --> 01:36:28.026]  Absolutely.
[01:36:28.546 --> 01:36:33.329]  After World War II, and they admittedly ran everything from the bioweapons labs in the U.S.
[01:36:33.609 --> 01:36:38.633]  They were the ones in West Texas and New Mexico giving uranium pills to pregnant GIs' wives.
[01:36:38.653 --> 01:36:40.354]  You're absolutely correct, Alex.
[01:36:40.634 --> 01:36:44.917]  And they also went to Porton Down, these Nazis.
[01:36:45.157 --> 01:36:47.759]  You see, it was the Germans who invented nerve agents.
[01:36:47.779 --> 01:36:52.482]  It was the Germans who invented sarin, tabun, suman.
[01:36:53.988 --> 01:36:55.409]  All deadly nerve agents.
[01:36:55.529 --> 01:36:56.749]  Mustard.
[01:36:56.809 --> 01:36:58.389]  Well, mustard isn't a nerve agent.
[01:36:58.469 --> 01:36:59.690]  It's a blistering agent.
[01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:02.671]  But, I mean, my point is they... Yeah, they were testing mustard.
[01:37:02.751 --> 01:37:05.011]  That's correct.
[01:37:05.511 --> 01:37:09.313]  But let me pick up on your Dr. Kelly comments.
[01:37:10.133 --> 01:37:12.854]  Now, Dr. Kelly, you know, was murdered.
[01:37:12.874 --> 01:37:14.074]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:37:14.918 --> 01:37:20.542]  I mean, the circumstances surrounding his death are just... just unbelievable.
[01:37:21.022 --> 01:37:22.823]  Men running away in black uniforms?
[01:37:22.883 --> 01:37:23.984]  Yes, exactly.
[01:37:24.184 --> 01:37:25.425]  And no inquest.
[01:37:26.706 --> 01:37:29.047]  Remember, no inquest was ever carried out.
[01:37:29.387 --> 01:37:36.432]  And the last person, one of the last people that Dr. Kelly spoke to was Judith Miller of the New York Times.
[01:37:38.413 --> 01:37:40.454]  Now, Kelly was beginning to talk.
[01:37:41.475 --> 01:37:42.375]  And he was a threat...
[01:37:43.877 --> 01:37:44.838]  To Porton Down.
[01:37:45.078 --> 01:37:48.642]  Yeah, he didn't know old Judith Miller was on the payroll.
[01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:51.005]  I guess every talk to her a phone call got made.
[01:37:51.545 --> 01:37:58.212]  Well, if you ever read Judith Miller's book, Germs, you'll see Dr. Kelly is mentioned several times in there.
[01:38:01.326 --> 01:38:04.711]  You know, he was obviously talking about porting down.
[01:38:04.751 --> 01:38:07.575]  He was a very disgruntled scientist.
[01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:17.648]  He knew a lot, but he wasn't getting the pay raises and the promotion that he expected, and he became very disgruntled, so he began talking.
[01:38:18.349 --> 01:38:20.050]  And that led to his downfall.
[01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:30.735]  I mean, how can it clearly be he was taken there, he didn't bleed to death there, that the special forces type troops are seen running off, and the media just goes, ignore that.
[01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:31.936]  You know something?
[01:38:31.956 --> 01:38:34.497]  The media is the problem in Britain.
[01:38:34.817 --> 01:38:38.779]  They do not report fully on matters such as this.
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:42.901]  There's no such program as yours in the UK.
[01:38:43.902 --> 01:38:45.923]  The BBC even is muted.
[01:38:47.244 --> 01:38:58.065]  I mean, recently the Ministry of Defence have admitted giving LSD to certain people at Porton Down and they've paid out compensation.
[01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:07.623]  But the BBC will never mention, you know, Pyrexol or VX or Soman or Taboon.
[01:39:09.004 --> 01:39:11.085]  They always mention the smallest little thing.
[01:39:11.105 --> 01:39:11.825]  That's right.
[01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.546]  They're lucky we gave you LSD.
[01:39:13.646 --> 01:39:14.567]  Everyone wants it.
[01:39:14.707 --> 01:39:16.288]  Ha ha, what whims.
[01:39:16.388 --> 01:39:16.848]  Really?
[01:39:17.228 --> 01:39:18.449]  They let them party.
[01:39:18.469 --> 01:39:24.232]  Yeah, you know, LSD is a pretty mundane substance compared to, say, VX.
[01:39:24.832 --> 01:39:26.713]  But the report on LSD...
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:31.441]  Sir, here's an example.
[01:39:31.481 --> 01:39:34.684]  They threatened the Abu Ghraib individuals.
[01:39:34.724 --> 01:39:36.485]  They threatened the camp x-ray individuals.
[01:39:36.786 --> 01:39:48.675]  So in Iraq and in Cuba, they tell them, and this is admitted, that if you don't say what we want you to say, we're going to take you to Egypt or Jordan or Georgia, and we're going to torture you to death.
[01:39:48.695 --> 01:39:52.458]  We're going to boil you alive in Tajikistan.
[01:39:53.179 --> 01:39:58.896]  And then the media uses the spin, oh, they love Camp X-Ray so much, they beg to stay there.
[01:39:59.708 --> 01:40:05.574]  No, they're being told you're going to be taken to be tortured to death in one of the super-secret sites.
[01:40:05.614 --> 01:40:09.377]  That's now admitted, and then the media spins it, and it's the same spin.
[01:40:09.417 --> 01:40:11.419]  They use a small thing like LSD.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.862]  Meanwhile, they're killing people with nerve gas.
[01:40:14.282 --> 01:40:15.924]  Yes, you're absolutely correct.
[01:40:15.984 --> 01:40:16.924]  But you know something?
[01:40:17.185 --> 01:40:23.531]  There was 45 deaths reported after the police investigation into Porton Downs.
[01:40:24.271 --> 01:40:35.561]  It was reported by the BBC that the police were investigating 45 premature deaths of servicemen who had been exposed to chemical and biological agents.
[01:40:35.681 --> 01:40:39.565]  Now let me ask you this question right now, and I've got that article in front of me, 45, and that's the tip of the iceberg.
[01:40:40.105 --> 01:40:45.150]  What is the doctors who did this to you, were they German, were they British, were they American?
[01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:49.173]  How do you think they could knowingly be ruining lives and murdering people?
[01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:51.015]  What was their rationale?
[01:40:51.515 --> 01:40:58.659]  Alex, I can tell you that one of these doctors is alive and well, and he's living here in Canada.
[01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:04.922]  He wrote an important technical paper on the inhalation of sarin.
[01:41:05.602 --> 01:41:13.306]  He was in party to the experiment on the BX, and he was involved in CSGAS.
[01:41:14.267 --> 01:41:15.187]  Well, why hasn't this...
[01:41:17.995 --> 01:41:23.139]  Why hasn't this mad scientist, you know, drunk a gallon of it himself if it's so delicious?
[01:41:23.399 --> 01:41:27.282]  Yeah, well, you know, why hasn't this scientist been arrested by the police?
[01:41:28.222 --> 01:41:30.224]  And, you know, they covered up for him.
[01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:36.168]  He's living in, you know, in comparative luxury out in British Columbia.
[01:41:37.145 --> 01:41:41.668]  And he's responsible for some of these horrible experiments.
[01:41:42.148 --> 01:41:44.730]  Now, for those that don't know, I want to personalize this.
[01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:49.133]  According to the reports, these people are flopping around, spit flying out of their mouth.
[01:41:49.173 --> 01:41:53.676]  These are young men being murdered, and it's just, how dare you even care?
[01:41:54.406 --> 01:41:55.687]  Well, of course, that's right.
[01:41:55.727 --> 01:42:00.512]  I mean, how dare you ask this thing about Porton Down?
[01:42:00.572 --> 01:42:04.716]  And it's a very dangerous place to, you know, to look into.
[01:42:04.736 --> 01:42:11.222]  There's a lot of deaths occurred, you know, suspicious deaths occurred at Porton Down.
[01:42:11.782 --> 01:42:19.990]  One recent one is a senior scientist at Porton Down whose plane just happened to crash, and he was killed.
[01:42:21.335 --> 01:42:27.019]  There's lots of scientists that are losing their lives in suspicious circumstances.
[01:42:27.119 --> 01:42:28.040]  But here's my question.
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:31.042]  Yeah, it's over 180 now all over the West.
[01:42:31.503 --> 01:42:32.643]  But let me ask you this question.
[01:42:34.144 --> 01:42:39.348]  Getting back to the psychology, have you ever been able to confront one of these doctors and say, why did you do this to us?
[01:42:39.428 --> 01:42:41.670]  Why did you maim and kill so many of us?
[01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:42.050]  Why?
[01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.130]  Why?
[01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:45.473]  No, I've never been able to confront them personally.
[01:42:45.573 --> 01:42:49.956]  I've been in touch with one of them in Canada here by email.
[01:42:51.216 --> 01:42:57.339]  And he admits to certain things that he did at Porton Down, but he won't give any details.
[01:42:58.299 --> 01:42:59.700]  You know, he's very evasive.
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.361]  But does he say why he did it?
[01:43:01.421 --> 01:43:02.421]  I mean, what's the psychology?
[01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:03.522]  No, he won't say why.
[01:43:03.542 --> 01:43:05.363]  He won't say why.
[01:43:05.623 --> 01:43:12.706]  And I asked him if he'd been interviewed by the police, and he was very vague on that as well.
[01:43:12.766 --> 01:43:18.409]  He said that certain individuals, investigators had...
[01:43:23.132 --> 01:43:27.574]  Sir, I'm sure you've researched chemical and biological testing on populations because it happened to you.
[01:43:27.934 --> 01:43:33.956]  Are you aware of Israel's ringworm children, how they radiated 110,000 of them with extreme pleasure?
[01:43:34.396 --> 01:43:36.017]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[01:43:36.657 --> 01:43:41.199]  Yeah, they take little three, five-year-olds, strap them down, radiate them, kill them, and the U.S.
[01:43:41.239 --> 01:43:46.641]  government paid for it, and it's in major Israeli papers, I mean, reporting on it, like they're reporting on the price of tires.
[01:43:46.941 --> 01:43:47.701]  Who's doing this?
[01:43:48.636 --> 01:43:49.497]  The Israeli government.
[01:43:49.517 --> 01:43:52.580]  They tell the kids they were going to a doctor's checkup and they'd murder them.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:53.100]  Yes.
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.822]  I don't quite believe it.
[01:43:59.686 --> 01:44:03.149]  I wonder why Steven Spielberg doesn't make a movie about that.
[01:44:06.552 --> 01:44:08.914]  How the Ashkenazi leadership loves to kill Sephardi.
[01:44:09.094 --> 01:44:09.454]  I don't know.
[01:44:09.854 --> 01:44:15.219]  Well, Steven won't do that, I don't think, because I believe he's Jewish, isn't he?
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:16.060]  Yes.
[01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:28.678]  Now, you know, another thing that happened after these experiments, you know, they turned us out of the gates of Porton Down and they did no follow-up medicals.
[01:44:29.638 --> 01:44:32.939]  You know, this is criminal negligence at its worst.
[01:44:33.559 --> 01:44:36.680]  Do you think they told the doctors that you guys had volunteered fully?
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.460]  I mean, obviously that wouldn't be a cover for long.
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:40.561]  They'd figure it out.
[01:44:40.721 --> 01:44:41.441]  Which doctors?
[01:44:43.234 --> 01:44:44.275]  Which doctors do you mean?
[01:44:44.375 --> 01:44:48.877]  Well, when they had you, I mean, did they have you sign a form or something when they said we're going to test the common cold on you?
[01:44:49.397 --> 01:44:50.978]  No, no, they never gave us any of that.
[01:44:50.998 --> 01:45:02.063]  The only form we were required to sign was the Official Secrets Act, which meant that if we talked about these experiments, we could be doing a lot of jail time.
[01:45:02.543 --> 01:45:02.963]  That's right.
[01:45:03.003 --> 01:45:10.867]  We've interviewed, of course, David Shaler, who spent jail time for exposing MI6 and MI5 involvement in terrorism.
[01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:12.090]  Yes.
[01:45:12.150 --> 01:45:25.019]  Well, of course, my letter from the Chief Constable of Wiltshire indicates that the MOD police were involved in this investigation, as were MI5 and MI6.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:27.780]  MOD's Ministry of Defence?
[01:45:28.461 --> 01:45:30.022]  That's the Ministry of Defence, yeah.
[01:45:31.033 --> 01:45:36.175]  Now, this was supposed to be a civilian police investigation into Porton Down.
[01:45:36.255 --> 01:45:39.477]  Well, let me ask you a question, and obviously it was a federal op.
[01:45:39.817 --> 01:45:41.697]  I mean, have you ever talked to these cops?
[01:45:42.098 --> 01:45:50.101]  Do you realize that... You know, Alex, I have asked numerous times to meet with these people, and they have flatly refused.
[01:45:51.075 --> 01:45:54.676]  Because they know that the questions I'm going to be asking them.
[01:45:55.676 --> 01:45:56.916]  You were in the RAF.
[01:45:56.936 --> 01:45:58.077]  I mean, you were one of them.
[01:45:58.157 --> 01:45:59.197]  You were in a uniform.
[01:45:59.317 --> 01:46:01.237]  Don't they realize they're not safe either?
[01:46:01.937 --> 01:46:02.497]  Absolutely.
[01:46:03.718 --> 01:46:05.138]  But, you know, well, of course.
[01:46:05.378 --> 01:46:12.240]  And there was a lot of strange things happened during the course of this police investigation into Porton Down.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.140]  For one thing, it was a major cover-up.
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:17.741]  Did any of the officers fall down and die?
[01:46:17.761 --> 01:46:17.801]  No.
[01:46:18.741 --> 01:46:18.901]  No?
[01:46:19.958 --> 01:46:21.380]  Oh, so I guess they rolled over then.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:29.931]  But they were supposedly given access to Porton Down to look at the records, which, of course, just did not happen.
[01:46:31.172 --> 01:46:33.756]  They would never be allowed in there to see the records.
[01:46:35.225 --> 01:46:39.687]  You know, it wouldn't allow any just Tom, Dick, and Harry from a police force.
[01:46:39.967 --> 01:46:41.808]  Now, I want to accelerate.
[01:46:41.848 --> 01:46:46.811]  What about the articles I've seen where in the mid-'80s they were still doing open-air tests on U.S.
[01:46:46.871 --> 01:46:49.512]  troops and British troops together in England?
[01:46:49.532 --> 01:46:50.353]  Can you comment on that?
[01:46:51.573 --> 01:46:53.274]  I'm not aware of that, actually.
[01:46:53.394 --> 01:46:58.257]  I concentrate mainly in the 1950s to 1960s.
[01:46:59.337 --> 01:47:01.098]  This was the height of the Cold War.
[01:47:02.199 --> 01:47:04.180]  And, of course, they were just doing anything.
[01:47:04.881 --> 01:47:17.906]  Well, I want to tell you, under Project Shad, conducted all over the world, including southern England, and you can pull it up, we've interviewed the people, they would have tank drivers in southern England just sit on top of their tanks.
[01:47:18.427 --> 01:47:22.928]  Jets would fly over at low levels and spray different chemical and biological agents on them.
[01:47:23.569 --> 01:47:24.949]  And I've interviewed some of those folks.
[01:47:24.989 --> 01:47:27.270]  So it's just so big, you're not even aware of that.
[01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:28.971]  Yeah, well, this did happen.
[01:47:29.011 --> 01:47:33.212]  But what they say is that they would kill the bacteria.
[01:47:33.252 --> 01:47:33.673]  There was no...
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:35.860]  That's right.
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.342]  But do you know that the British police went to the Pentagon?
[01:47:59.699 --> 01:48:00.520]  No, I didn't know that.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:01.200]  Yes, they did.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.381]  They went to the Pentagon.
[01:48:03.041 --> 01:48:07.885]  And they went to Port Dietrich as well, which is the U.S.'
[01:48:07.865 --> 01:48:09.466]  's equivalent to Porton Down.
[01:48:10.847 --> 01:48:16.991]  Now, they went there supposedly to get records and to get permission to carry out this investigation.
[01:48:18.552 --> 01:48:20.453]  But it's all now being hushed up.
[01:48:22.115 --> 01:48:25.957]  But they did actually go to the Pentagon on more than one occasion.
[01:48:26.358 --> 01:48:27.558]  And that was just before 9-11.
[01:48:30.450 --> 01:48:35.252]  Would you be surprised to know that the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible that the U.S.
[01:48:35.292 --> 01:48:36.952]  government launched the anthrax attacks?
[01:48:38.133 --> 01:48:40.874]  Well, let me tell you about this anthrax business.
[01:48:41.234 --> 01:48:51.737]  You know, when the mailings took place, I emailed the FBI to get in touch with the British police who were investigating Porton Down.
[01:48:52.337 --> 01:48:56.759]  Now, it is known that Porton Down has the Ames strain of anthrax.
[01:48:58.563 --> 01:49:11.593]  And Dr. Stephen Hartfield was reported in the paper, in UK papers, that he had visited Porton Down just prior to the anthrax mailings.
[01:49:13.375 --> 01:49:22.502]  Now, I never got any word back from the FBI, but I did read in the paper that they had went to Porton Down.
[01:49:23.936 --> 01:49:28.538]  Yeah, they also went after Hatfield, but it was really an Israeli agent.
[01:49:28.798 --> 01:49:33.559]  Hatfield was paid to go to Portland Down by the British government.
[01:49:33.759 --> 01:49:37.280]  That was what was reported in their main newspapers.
[01:49:38.901 --> 01:49:41.742]  You know, I have to ask, what was Hatfield doing there?
[01:49:42.502 --> 01:49:45.323]  Who did he mix, who did he socialize with?
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.961]  Uh, and what was he told at Porton Down?
[01:49:49.021 --> 01:49:50.482]  Why, what was he doing there?
[01:49:50.703 --> 01:49:51.843]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:49:51.863 --> 01:49:52.684]  Stay there, Mr. Bell.
[01:49:53.044 --> 01:49:59.869]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:01.570]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:03.951]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.111 --> 01:50:06.193]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.473 --> 01:50:11.416]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:11.756 --> 01:50:15.779]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:15.959 --> 01:50:16.179]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:50:16.199 --> 01:50:16.759]  Or order online.
[01:50:44.532 --> 01:50:49.975]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:50:52.336 --> 01:50:58.118]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[01:50:58.339 --> 01:51:00.820]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:03.601]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[01:51:03.761 --> 01:51:07.463]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[01:51:07.563 --> 01:51:12.665]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[01:51:12.865 --> 01:51:13.285]  We're good to go.
[01:51:38.626 --> 01:51:38.926]  Or call 312-224-2710.
[01:51:38.946 --> 01:51:39.207]  That's 312-224-2710.
[01:51:53.618 --> 01:51:59.540]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:02.041]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.221 --> 01:52:08.583]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:08.923 --> 01:52:09.563]  We're good to go.
[01:52:24.468 --> 01:52:24.988]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.008 --> 01:52:25.308]  I think?
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:07.282]  I want the listeners to know that what we're covering here is just the surface.
[01:53:09.343 --> 01:53:11.224]  We know they're putting cancer viruses.
[01:53:11.364 --> 01:53:15.366]  This was developed by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation back in the 30s and many of the vaccines.
[01:53:15.746 --> 01:53:20.268]  We know it's part of a larger eugenics, Malthusian, social Darwin program.
[01:53:20.288 --> 01:53:26.150]  We have Dr. Henry Kissinger documents from 73 declassified in the Library of Congress where they order the third world.
[01:53:26.230 --> 01:53:27.331]  Of course, they'll be sterilized.
[01:53:27.791 --> 01:53:28.592]  We're good to go.
[01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:51.491]  Pale in comparison.
[01:53:51.531 --> 01:54:00.417]  Going back to Gordon Bell, who he's got his own documents through his member of parliament, who really accidentally gave them to him.
[01:54:01.258 --> 01:54:07.142]  And, of course, now a lot more about Project Shad, what went on at Porton Down, and other things have come out.
[01:54:07.743 --> 01:54:10.004]  But killing 40-plus people, admittedly.
[01:54:10.425 --> 01:54:13.387]  What are some of the other ways you now know that they killed these other people?
[01:54:15.347 --> 01:54:28.937]  Well, these were just newspaper reports, you know, and I put a freedom of information request into the Wiltshire Police to have more information regarding their investigation into these premature deaths.
[01:54:30.178 --> 01:54:34.301]  Now, my freedom of information request was rejected.
[01:54:34.321 --> 01:54:36.362]  They will not talk about it.
[01:54:37.663 --> 01:54:38.924]  This was all covered up.
[01:54:39.657 --> 01:54:50.284]  Now, in the case of the one young man who was a nerve gas to death, Ronald Madison, I have the BBC report right here, they admit that after they killed him, they went ahead and dissected him, too.
[01:54:50.304 --> 01:54:51.365]  It was a great experiment.
[01:54:51.685 --> 01:54:54.627]  Then they lied to the family and kept body parts and didn't even tell them.
[01:54:55.146 --> 01:55:01.729]  Yes, well, you know, the inquest was held in secret, and only Madison's father was allowed to attend.
[01:55:01.749 --> 01:55:14.775]  And he was threatened with the Official Secrets Act that he was not to talk about what went on at the inquest, that he could possibly be prosecuted if he did talk about it.
[01:55:14.795 --> 01:55:18.137]  You know what, if somebody ever murders any of my family members,
[01:55:19.437 --> 01:55:20.457]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:55:20.697 --> 01:55:22.378]  And there's going to be hell to pay, guaranteed.
[01:55:22.458 --> 01:55:23.358]  You're damn right.
[01:55:23.378 --> 01:55:25.259]  And, you know, there was no way that shut me up.
[01:55:25.279 --> 01:55:39.182]  But you've got to go back to those times in the 50s where, you know, they could very well, especially in Britain, lock you up for talking about the Official Secrets Act for breaking the... Well, my only point to this is, sir, I've studied this.
[01:55:39.282 --> 01:55:43.003]  Stuff going on in the 50s is nothing compared to what goes on now, sir.
[01:55:43.043 --> 01:55:44.664]  I mean, it's just massive now.
[01:55:45.124 --> 01:55:46.044]  I don't doubt it, Alex.
[01:55:46.784 --> 01:55:53.554]  But, you know, getting back to the ANSVAX mailings, I'm surprised that the FBI have not come up with something.
[01:55:53.614 --> 01:55:56.178]  It seems as if the whole case has gone cold.
[01:55:56.198 --> 01:56:01.225]  They really don't want to find out who's responsible for these mailings.
[01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:04.212]  Let me see.
[01:56:04.292 --> 01:56:05.172]  It's U.S.
[01:56:05.232 --> 01:56:08.273]  super-grade, miniaturized, coated in bentonite.
[01:56:08.313 --> 01:56:13.755]  It takes a $100 million-plus factory to miniaturize it and coat it in bentonite.
[01:56:13.935 --> 01:56:18.537]  They put little sails on each spore so it's aerosolized better and stays in the air.
[01:56:18.837 --> 01:56:24.059]  It gets mailed to all of Bush's enemies, and Bush uses it for a Patriot Act sale.
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:25.380]  I mean, come on.
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.042]  You know, you've got to take all this with a pinch of salt, actually.
[01:56:30.102 --> 01:56:30.522]  And, you know...
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:34.042]  We know basically what's going on here.
[01:56:34.322 --> 01:56:38.226]  Anybody with any common sense can work out what's going on.
[01:56:39.066 --> 01:56:43.850]  You know, who mailed this anthrax out and what was the purpose of the mailing?
[01:56:44.811 --> 01:56:48.494]  And why have the FBI just suddenly gone quiet on all of this?
[01:56:50.536 --> 01:56:52.718]  You know, they should be investigating much more
[01:56:53.721 --> 01:57:03.006]  And cooperating with the Wiltshire Police, for example, who have investigated Porton Down for five years, since 1999.
[01:57:04.467 --> 01:57:07.089]  And it appears that they haven't done that.
[01:57:09.401 --> 01:57:21.267]  Sir, I want to keep you another 15 minutes or so because I want you to be able to get into other facets of what happened to you, physically what you're going through, and if you personally know any of the other porting down survivors.
[01:57:21.507 --> 01:57:25.829]  But folks, this goes to the very heart of the mindset of the elite.
[01:57:26.210 --> 01:57:27.310]  What they really think of us.
[01:57:27.650 --> 01:57:30.412]  We're as valuable as white lab rats to them.
[01:57:30.452 --> 01:57:30.792]  That's it.
[01:57:33.055 --> 01:57:33.575]  If you... If you... If you...
[01:57:49.008 --> 01:57:49.648]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.309 --> 01:57:51.349]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.069 --> 01:57:53.190]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:54.651]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.411 --> 01:57:56.291]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.992 --> 01:58:00.734]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.154 --> 01:58:05.256]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.329 --> 01:58:15.450]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:25.982]  There's an article up on InfoWars.com, PrisonBlinded.com, and InfoWars.net by Steve Watson, the most powerful weapon in the world, strategic communications laboratories, and the war on for your mind.
[01:58:26.323 --> 01:58:29.006]  And it's got Lord Mombatten on it and the rest of them.
[01:58:30.385 --> 01:58:38.868]  And they openly talk about dominating the population for the elite, how that's how it's supposed to run, how the media's all propaganda, how they're going to brainwash us, how good it is.
[01:58:38.888 --> 01:58:40.109]  I mean, go read.
[01:58:40.309 --> 01:58:41.910]  Go read what a big PR firm says.
[01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:44.371]  I mean, again, on their own website, we will control them.
[01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:46.411]  We'll keep the power where it belongs.
[01:58:46.451 --> 01:58:47.592]  We've got them now.
[01:58:48.456 --> 01:58:49.837]  I mean, just go read it for yourself.
[01:58:49.877 --> 01:58:52.238]  Don't just even believe our article about it, which is full of their quotes.
[01:58:52.278 --> 01:58:53.518]  Go link through and see it.
[01:58:53.958 --> 01:58:57.380]  I know we didn't get too much of the callers that were holding last hour from the first hour.
[01:58:57.800 --> 01:58:59.300]  We will open the phones up this hour.
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.261]  We will take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:01.281 --> 01:59:01.541]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:01.981 --> 01:59:13.686]  A bunch of other news we're going to be covering coming up later, but for the next 20 minutes, we're joined by an individual who helped break open the story of Borden Down.
[01:59:14.966 --> 01:59:16.287]  By a slip of fate...
[01:59:17.397 --> 01:59:20.078]  By a trick of fate, whatever you want to call it.
[01:59:21.158 --> 01:59:23.959]  It's just like two days before Thanksgiving.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:26.680]  In 1998, we're driving along.
[01:59:27.301 --> 01:59:27.841]  There's U.S.
[01:59:27.901 --> 01:59:30.742]  Army jerking people out of their cars, doing searches.
[01:59:31.522 --> 01:59:32.282]  We pull over.
[01:59:32.603 --> 01:59:38.505]  FBI agent pulls up, says, back off, don't ask questions, and gives us a five-page document.
[01:59:39.145 --> 01:59:40.565]  Turns out it was classified.
[01:59:42.126 --> 01:59:44.947]  And it admits that they've totally violated posse commentatus.
[01:59:45.027 --> 01:59:45.147]  They
[01:59:45.782 --> 01:59:46.182]  We're good to go.
[02:00:07.769 --> 02:00:11.192]  And they gave him classified documents.
[02:00:11.752 --> 02:00:16.916]  And then he complained in the police investigation, their own whitewash at least caused more to come out.
[02:00:17.808 --> 02:00:23.774]  And so continuing with our guest, an amazing individual, Gordon Bell, we've got your story you wrote up on the site.
[02:00:23.794 --> 02:00:26.756]  We've got articles about you up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:27.337 --> 02:00:30.019]  Any other websites or places we should visit to learn more?
[02:00:32.121 --> 02:00:34.944]  You could go on to Wiltshire Police website.
[02:00:36.305 --> 02:00:42.511]  You won't learn a lot there, but it'll give you an idea of what took place at the inquest into this Madison incident.
[02:00:43.251 --> 02:00:54.317]  By the way, this inquest was the second inquest and it was a jury inquest that brought in a verdict of unlawful killing by those at Porton Down.
[02:00:57.539 --> 02:01:08.044]  Now, the MOD, the Ministry of Defence, appealed this and thought that the coroner had acted improperly in conducting the inquest and they appealed it.
[02:01:08.784 --> 02:01:11.646]  But they just recently lost that appeal.
[02:01:12.546 --> 02:01:20.970]  Now the coroner's been ordered by the High Court to publish his summing up of the inquest into the death of this airman.
[02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:25.612]  And by the way, this inquest took place 50 years after he was killed.
[02:01:28.533 --> 02:01:29.133]  Amazing.
[02:01:29.153 --> 02:01:30.514]  It is amazing, yeah.
[02:01:30.834 --> 02:01:32.275]  I have his records, actually.
[02:01:32.295 --> 02:01:34.315]  I have Madison's records right here.
[02:01:36.841 --> 02:01:43.483]  And he was given 200 milligrams of sarin, but there was also something else that was never brought up at the inquest.
[02:01:44.223 --> 02:01:54.526]  And that is, there were substances put on his arm, four substances put on Madison's arm that has never been mentioned.
[02:01:54.546 --> 02:01:58.207]  And these substances are numbered ST-125, ST-126, ST-127, ST-128.
[02:02:05.549 --> 02:02:24.920]  Now, this was never covered at the inquest, and let me tell you that the coroner, before the inquest began, the coroner, David Masters, went to the United States for briefings as to what can be told at this inquest, and what cannot be told.
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.181]  I know that for a fact.
[02:02:29.267 --> 02:02:31.751]  Wow, that's even more amazing.
[02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:36.979]  He went to the Pentagon in Washington before the inquest took place.
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:40.505]  And there were secret meetings taking place.
[02:02:40.645 --> 02:02:40.986]  All right.
[02:02:41.126 --> 02:02:41.567]  Stay there, sir.
[02:02:41.607 --> 02:02:44.151]  We'll cover some more key facets of this story.
[02:02:44.811 --> 02:02:53.433]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.
[02:02:53.633 --> 02:03:04.896]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:03:04.916 --> 02:03:07.777]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:08.117 --> 02:03:12.218]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[02:03:12.578 --> 02:03:22.826]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:03:23.086 --> 02:03:28.751]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:03:45.996 --> 02:03:48.838]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:03:49.098 --> 02:03:49.799]  Hello, my friends.
[02:03:49.899 --> 02:03:50.679]  Alex Jones here.

[02:03:56.043 --> 02:04:02.807]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:04:03.107 --> 02:04:05.087]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:04:05.288 --> 02:04:08.128]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:04:08.228 --> 02:04:12.889]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:04:13.089 --> 02:04:17.490]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:04:17.730 --> 02:04:24.952]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:05:45.427 --> 02:05:47.589]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.170 --> 02:05:50.973]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:15.035 --> 02:06:23.241]  Welcome back to our guest who had biological and chemical weapons tested on him.
[02:06:23.261 --> 02:06:26.563]  He was told they were going to test the common cold on him when he was in the Royal Air Force.
[02:06:26.723 --> 02:06:32.087]  Oh, you'll get a weekend pass and two pounds, you know, equivalent of a couple dollars.
[02:06:32.187 --> 02:06:34.869]  And he goes and signs the Official Secrets Act.
[02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:38.472]  When you were signing the Official Secrets Act before they tested on you,
[02:06:38.892 --> 02:06:46.818]  Did you think, Mr. Bell, Gordon Bell, hey, this may be more than just them testing the cold bug on me?
[02:06:46.858 --> 02:06:50.281]  This may be something more, I'm signing some national security document?
[02:06:50.702 --> 02:07:00.069]  You know, Alex, we were so naive at that time, we were so young and so trusting and so stupid, I would say, that we never even questioned it.
[02:07:00.089 --> 02:07:06.094]  I mean, when I look back on what I went through at Porton Down, I must have been mad.
[02:07:07.105 --> 02:07:08.626]  For falling for this nonsense.
[02:07:08.686 --> 02:07:09.467]  What did you go through?
[02:07:09.507 --> 02:07:10.307]  I mean, describe it.
[02:07:10.327 --> 02:07:13.769]  I mean, what was the looks on the face of these doctors as they were applying bio-wax?
[02:07:13.789 --> 02:07:18.732]  Well, there were white coats and there was gas chambers and there was a hospital ward there.
[02:07:18.792 --> 02:07:22.795]  They injected me in there along with five or six other guys.
[02:07:23.575 --> 02:07:25.997]  And we never found out what the substance was.
[02:07:27.178 --> 02:07:32.181]  I was told by the Wilshire Police that they were injecting VX and sarin.
[02:07:32.896 --> 02:07:34.836]  In the hospital ward at Porton Down.
[02:07:34.856 --> 02:07:38.497]  I mean, this was told by me by the lead investigator.
[02:07:38.757 --> 02:07:41.738]  Now, sir, go over what this has done to you physically.
[02:07:42.278 --> 02:07:49.119]  Well, I came down with a skin condition like many other veterans, and I also have rheumatoid arthritis.
[02:07:50.079 --> 02:07:54.680]  Now, rheumatoid arthritis is linked to LPS exposure.
[02:07:55.961 --> 02:07:57.961]  LPS is lipopolysaccharide.
[02:07:58.021 --> 02:08:02.322]  It's a bacterial endotoxin that we were dishing out at Porton Down.
[02:08:03.067 --> 02:08:04.508]  They call it pyrexol.
[02:08:06.128 --> 02:08:08.249]  What about those tumors and rashes?
[02:08:08.269 --> 02:08:23.114]  I've got a large tumor on my arm which you'll see if you picked up that photo that I sent you that just sprouted up after I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis but unfortunately my
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:28.521]  Medical records are missing from Porton Down.
[02:08:28.941 --> 02:08:29.302]  That's right.
[02:08:29.322 --> 02:08:30.042]  They do this to you.
[02:08:30.062 --> 02:08:30.822]  Not surprising, is it?
[02:08:31.042 --> 02:08:33.603]  They do this to you, and then they don't even want to give you any treatment.
[02:08:33.963 --> 02:08:35.824]  All my records are missing at Porton Down.
[02:08:35.844 --> 02:08:46.107]  There's only a very brief summary record that they've given me, and they use important technical papers to substitute for the missing records.
[02:08:46.627 --> 02:08:47.608]  I think we're good to go.
[02:09:06.770 --> 02:09:08.731]  I've been very curious about that.
[02:09:08.811 --> 02:09:12.754]  I'm certain that they were putting in LPS into CS gas.
[02:09:13.034 --> 02:09:21.900]  Now, for those that don't know, you talk about these four or five other substances that the documents show they were putting on you with the CS, and please continue.
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:35.869]  Well, the police actually, in a letter to me, stated that they discovered that they had added a compound into the CS gas, and they were going to tell me about it in due course.
[02:09:37.113 --> 02:09:46.077]  Now, they have never told me to this day what it is, and I've put in a Freedom of Information Act request, and it's been rejected.
[02:09:46.777 --> 02:09:48.578]  Well, let me try to boil this down for people.
[02:09:48.958 --> 02:09:49.178]  Yep.
[02:09:49.738 --> 02:09:58.662]  Project Shad went on until 1985, and that dealt with tens of thousands of American and British airmen and soldiers, sailors, marines.
[02:09:59.831 --> 02:10:00.232]  I think so.
[02:10:15.243 --> 02:10:16.824]  Oh my gosh, he's pure evil.
[02:10:16.864 --> 02:10:18.024]  He needs to be electrocuted.
[02:10:19.465 --> 02:10:20.545]  Get out old Sparky.
[02:10:20.865 --> 02:10:27.748]  But when the government does it and it's declassified or been leaked or been admitted, it's just kind of, yeah, we murder our servicemen, so what?
[02:10:27.788 --> 02:10:28.548]  We love you.
[02:10:28.888 --> 02:10:30.669]  Trust us in everything else we do.
[02:10:31.629 --> 02:10:36.271]  I mean, there's 3,000-plus declassified instances of our own government doing this.
[02:10:37.852 --> 02:10:42.854]  You're just one of many we've interviewed, sir, with your government, basically taking orders from the American government.
[02:10:43.114 --> 02:10:45.495]  That much was clear from what you said in the last segment.
[02:10:46.376 --> 02:10:51.578]  So, I mean, what does this say about our government's period and about how trustworthy they are?
[02:10:51.918 --> 02:11:00.002]  Well, first of all, I should say that there have been many calls for an independent public inquiry into the affairs of Porton Downs.
[02:11:00.362 --> 02:11:00.622]  Right?
[02:11:00.922 --> 02:11:02.443]  They were always turned down.
[02:11:03.343 --> 02:11:13.368]  Now, the present Secretary of Defense, Dr. John Reid, who is, your equivalent is Rumsfeld, right?
[02:11:13.928 --> 02:11:18.790]  The UK, he's the head of the armed forces in the UK, a cabinet minister.
[02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:26.734]  He's an ex-communist party member, this guy, Dr. John Reid, and he's now headed...
[02:11:28.484 --> 02:11:32.925]  He's in the main post of the Defense Department.
[02:11:34.145 --> 02:11:36.066]  Sir, now wait a minute.
[02:11:36.226 --> 02:11:38.826]  If you're against communism, you're not a good conservative.
[02:11:38.946 --> 02:11:40.987]  If you're against communism, you're a dirty commie.
[02:11:41.007 --> 02:11:51.629]  You haven't learned that almost Bush's entire cabinet are, quote, former Straussians and former Communist Third International Trotskyites?
[02:11:51.989 --> 02:11:52.229]  Yes.
[02:11:53.087 --> 02:11:59.349]  Could you imagine if it was discovered that Rumsfeld had been a Communist Party member?
[02:12:00.570 --> 02:12:03.011]  You know, and yet we have this situation.
[02:12:03.031 --> 02:12:04.591]  Sir, sir, I know, I know.
[02:12:04.611 --> 02:12:06.632]  Listen, reality is so crazy.
[02:12:06.872 --> 02:12:07.092]  Yes.
[02:12:07.512 --> 02:12:11.294]  That you even try to tell people, they just, you know, they can't get it.
[02:12:11.594 --> 02:12:13.314]  What about the security, you know?
[02:12:13.334 --> 02:12:17.316]  I mean, you know, national security, when you've got an ex-commie heading the...
[02:12:17.876 --> 02:12:27.885]  Sir, if you tell America that they hired General Primakov, former head of the KGB, with $2 million a year to consult setting up Homeland Security, they'll laugh at you even when it's mainstream news.
[02:12:28.145 --> 02:12:32.169]  If you tell them they hired Marcus Wolff, former head of the Stasi, I mean, they hired him.
[02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:32.849]  It's official.
[02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:34.030]  I didn't believe it.
[02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:36.352]  I went and looked up the federal budget funding.
[02:12:37.473 --> 02:12:39.855]  And then now look at America, what we're turning into, sir.
[02:12:40.456 --> 02:12:44.700]  I don't know what America's turning into, but, you know, it isn't very nice.
[02:12:46.903 --> 02:12:58.988]  You know, I'm going to ask, you know, what are UK coroners doing in the United States being briefed on an inquest into the death of an airman at Porton Down, you know, on British soil?
[02:12:59.048 --> 02:13:00.448]  Well, that's because, sir, the U.S.
[02:13:00.468 --> 02:13:02.089]  government paid for Porton Down studies.
[02:13:02.389 --> 02:13:02.729]  The U.S.
[02:13:02.749 --> 02:13:05.850]  government paid to radiate 110,000 Jewish children.
[02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:06.310]  That's right.
[02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:08.291]  In Israel, our government runs it all.
[02:13:08.591 --> 02:13:10.372]  The exchanged information, right?
[02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:16.674]  Well, I mean, it's like, I mean, it'd be like if I said my right arm wasn't part of me.
[02:13:16.814 --> 02:13:19.697]  England is just part of the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:13:19.717 --> 02:13:20.077]  It isn't.
[02:13:20.838 --> 02:13:23.780]  I mean, it isn't that America runs England or England runs America.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:25.401]  It's the same creature.
[02:13:25.421 --> 02:13:26.082]  It is.
[02:13:26.102 --> 02:13:26.742]  You're right.
[02:13:26.782 --> 02:13:28.203]  You're absolutely right.
[02:13:29.024 --> 02:13:32.107]  And I think it's pretty well, that part's pretty well known.
[02:13:32.167 --> 02:13:33.508]  Not lost on us, anyhow.
[02:13:34.828 --> 02:13:44.899]  You know, I applied to give a Freedom of Information request in for transcripts of the Madison inquest and I was turned down.
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:48.182]  You're not allowed to know what was said at the inquest.
[02:13:49.484 --> 02:13:50.445]  I mean, it's absurd.
[02:13:51.218 --> 02:13:53.940]  Now, we're going to have an inquest to get the truth out, then the inquest is secret.
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:55.481]  Yeah, right.
[02:13:55.701 --> 02:13:59.343]  And, you know, this second inquest was just not above board at all.
[02:13:59.423 --> 02:14:06.548]  So, although we got the right verdict on lawful killing, it was not fully covered.
[02:14:06.568 --> 02:14:07.189]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:14:07.649 --> 02:14:09.890]  The official inquest says they're murdering people.
[02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:10.271]  Yes.
[02:14:10.371 --> 02:14:12.252]  But it's okay, and we're going to keep doing it.
[02:14:12.272 --> 02:14:14.794]  In fact, they're still doing experiments at Borton Down, aren't they?
[02:14:14.814 --> 02:14:15.474]  They are, yes.
[02:14:15.534 --> 02:14:18.136]  And I'm going there at the end of the month for another meeting.
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:26.007]  On the 31st, I'm meeting with Porton Down officials, senior officials, and I have a lot to ask them.
[02:14:26.067 --> 02:14:28.009]  Now, you're a very well-informed person, Mr. Bell.
[02:14:28.029 --> 02:14:36.398]  Are you aware that it's been in mainstream New York papers that they take young children from poor mothers and then test pesticide and other things on them?
[02:14:36.898 --> 02:14:40.942]  Yes, I've heard that some of the Monsanto and those who are testing...
[02:14:42.123 --> 02:14:44.604]  Pesticides, herbicides on children in the field.
[02:14:44.624 --> 02:14:45.305]  Yeah, they actually kill them.
[02:14:45.325 --> 02:14:47.166]  They actually, just like warm down.
[02:14:47.206 --> 02:14:53.869]  I mean, to read a New York Daily News description of the eight-year-old black boy... Yes, in the field.
[02:14:54.009 --> 02:14:54.949]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:57.471]  ...scrapped down to the chair, gasping and dying.
[02:14:57.791 --> 02:14:59.752]  And it's just, oh, his dead body, bury him now.
[02:14:59.832 --> 02:15:00.352]  Ha-ha!
[02:15:00.592 --> 02:15:01.132]  Ha-ha!
[02:15:01.172 --> 02:15:03.293]  We're America, the pure demon!
[02:15:03.313 --> 02:15:03.814]  Yeah.
[02:15:04.594 --> 02:15:06.315]  And it's just thousands of them.
[02:15:06.735 --> 02:15:08.256]  Were you aware of the illegal aliens?
[02:15:08.757 --> 02:15:09.657]  They don't even tell them.
[02:15:09.677 --> 02:15:11.939]  They say, $5,000, let us test this on you.
[02:15:12.119 --> 02:15:13.479]  And they're killing a bunch of them, too.
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:14.920]  Yeah, really.
[02:15:15.401 --> 02:15:17.542]  You see, now they've run out of troops who'll agree to it.
[02:15:17.562 --> 02:15:20.284]  They've run out of firemen and cops who'll do it, who mean well.
[02:15:20.764 --> 02:15:24.546]  Alex, it's mind-boggling what they get up to.
[02:15:25.287 --> 02:15:28.028]  And I've found that through my own experience, you know.
[02:15:28.148 --> 02:15:30.730]  Well, we're on patriotic because we're against murdering small children.
[02:15:31.406 --> 02:15:32.446]  Yeah, I know.
[02:15:32.626 --> 02:15:34.227]  That's what they'll try to tell you, yeah.
[02:15:34.447 --> 02:15:39.448]  I mean, I'm unpatriotic because I'm exposing what went on at Porton Down.
[02:15:40.368 --> 02:15:42.489]  The criminality that took place there.
[02:15:42.649 --> 02:15:45.950]  In fact, you should apologize, just like Mr. Whittington and Cheney shot in the face.
[02:15:45.970 --> 02:15:48.851]  You should say, I'm sorry you nerve-gassed me and I've got tumors.
[02:15:49.731 --> 02:15:50.611]  Yeah, right.
[02:15:51.681 --> 02:15:53.583]  In fact, do you want to tell them you're sorry that they nerve gassed you?
[02:15:53.883 --> 02:16:09.236]  Well, they're supposed to be doing an epidemiological study on the effects of these experiments conducted at Porton Down, and it's a complete sham, because for one thing, they're only doing studies relative to cancers.
[02:16:09.937 --> 02:16:13.560]  They're not doing any autoimmune system diseases or anything like that.
[02:16:14.744 --> 02:16:17.486]  And, you know, they don't have all the records.
[02:16:17.847 --> 02:16:19.548]  Like, I don't have all my records.
[02:16:20.088 --> 02:16:21.589]  Well, sir, they never do.
[02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:29.214]  I mean, listen, they did a rhesus monkey test with seven monkeys, and five of them had seizures so bad they had to be put to sleep.
[02:16:29.274 --> 02:16:30.095]  Another one died.
[02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:31.616]  One barely lived.
[02:16:31.876 --> 02:16:40.342]  And on that, Monsanto, formerly Surrell, got certification for aspartame off of their own study where the monkeys died.
[02:16:40.562 --> 02:16:40.762]  Yes.
[02:16:41.362 --> 02:16:42.223]  Oh, I don't doubt it.
[02:16:42.867 --> 02:16:43.628]  Better them than servicemen.
[02:16:43.648 --> 02:16:44.189]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:16:44.209 --> 02:16:46.211]  It's a really sad state of affairs, but...
[02:17:02.572 --> 02:17:05.294]  You know, I'm always concerned about my safety now.
[02:17:05.355 --> 02:17:06.415]  Well, let me ask you this, sir.
[02:17:06.455 --> 02:17:17.065]  I mean, what does it make you think of, just, I mean, for the listeners, we have a government running things that openly murders its own troops knowingly.
[02:17:17.145 --> 02:17:18.566]  Just murders them for fun.
[02:17:19.086 --> 02:17:19.347]  Yes.
[02:17:20.207 --> 02:17:22.109]  And then they're caught and no one gets in trouble.
[02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:23.290]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:24.211]  It's always covered up.
[02:17:24.835 --> 02:17:26.497]  You know, it's amazing.
[02:17:26.657 --> 02:17:31.183]  Well, sir, I want to thank you, Mr. Bell, for spending all of this time with us.
[02:17:31.823 --> 02:17:34.246]  And as new things develop, I want to get you back on.
[02:17:35.007 --> 02:17:39.773]  You're welcome, Alex, and don't hesitate to contact me at any time or any of your listeners.
[02:17:40.354 --> 02:17:42.796]  Feel free to... Taylor, stay there.
[02:17:42.836 --> 02:17:43.958]  Taylor, stay there.
[02:17:45.163 --> 02:17:52.030]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:17:52.190 --> 02:18:05.122]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:18:05.302 --> 02:18:07.084]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:18:07.244 --> 02:18:10.725]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:18:11.005 --> 02:18:14.786]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:18:15.046 --> 02:18:19.987]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:18:20.267 --> 02:18:21.968]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:18:22.248 --> 02:18:26.229]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[02:18:46.949 --> 02:18:47.991]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.391 --> 02:18:53.898]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:54.960]  That's right.
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:57.563]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:57.883 --> 02:19:05.053]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:05.606 --> 02:19:06.687]  We're good to go.
[02:19:24.901 --> 02:19:25.281]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.578 --> 02:19:47.941]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:19:48.181 --> 02:19:50.223]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:19:50.363 --> 02:19:57.411]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:19:57.691 --> 02:20:06.240]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:20:06.580 --> 02:20:11.263]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[02:20:33.199 --> 02:20:35.962]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:20:46.624 --> 02:20:47.665]  The war on terrorism.
[02:20:47.985 --> 02:20:50.768]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:20:51.048 --> 02:20:55.192]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:20:55.632 --> 02:20:56.453]  So what do you do?
[02:20:56.773 --> 02:21:01.357]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:21:01.838 --> 02:21:03.960]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.321]  Sheltering in place.
[02:21:05.674 --> 02:21:06.494]  We're good to go.
[02:21:31.421 --> 02:21:33.542]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:21:33.562 --> 02:21:37.745]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:37.845 --> 02:21:39.526]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.664 --> 02:22:06.007]  By the way, Mr. Bell, tell folks what you did to your Member of Parliament when he wouldn't help you and was helping cover things up, and after you learned that he'd been covering things up.
[02:22:07.467 --> 02:22:08.888]  Would you repeat that question, Alex?
[02:22:08.968 --> 02:22:09.688]  I just missed it.
[02:22:09.988 --> 02:22:12.729]  What did you do to your Member of Parliament when you found out he'd been lying to you?
[02:22:13.009 --> 02:22:14.069]  I was furious.
[02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:15.230]  I attacked his office.
[02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:19.531]  I smashed all his office up, the front of his office.
[02:22:20.351 --> 02:22:25.013]  I was furious that he was hiding stuff from me regarding the death of an airman.
[02:22:25.896 --> 02:22:32.279]  And I was charged for criminal damage, but they never went ahead with the prosecution.
[02:22:32.339 --> 02:22:34.800]  They hushed it up and they just gave me a caution.
[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:36.600]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:39.182]  So how many rocks you threw through his windows?
[02:22:39.202 --> 02:22:39.782]  A whole lot.
[02:22:39.862 --> 02:22:41.082]  I smashed everything in.
[02:22:42.503 --> 02:22:45.604]  These people, you know, they can't get away with doing that.
[02:22:45.624 --> 02:22:46.104]  Frankly, that's mild.
[02:22:48.347 --> 02:22:49.908]  Yeah, it is, Miles.
[02:22:49.948 --> 02:22:54.171]  I mean, you can replace the windows in an office, but you can't replace people's health.
[02:22:55.933 --> 02:22:57.374]  You can't bring them back to life.
[02:22:58.354 --> 02:23:01.617]  Well, I just want the police and military to know you're the number one target.
[02:23:01.637 --> 02:23:02.999]  They do this to cops all the time.
[02:23:03.299 --> 02:23:08.324]  And you guys just sit there like a dutiful dog whose owner's giving it poison pills.
[02:23:08.364 --> 02:23:09.965]  You just, oh, I love you, owner.
[02:23:10.286 --> 02:23:11.487]  I love you, New World Order.
[02:23:11.627 --> 02:23:12.488]  Kill me!
[02:23:12.508 --> 02:23:14.430]  I hate Alex Jones.
[02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:15.871]  He wants to keep me safe.
[02:23:15.911 --> 02:23:16.672]  He's bad.
[02:23:17.132 --> 02:23:17.933]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:23:18.414 --> 02:23:18.694]  Tell them.
[02:23:19.372 --> 02:23:27.635]  You know, it's a sad state of affairs, Alex, but I'm glad there's shows like yours that comes along and exposes things as they should be exposed.
[02:23:27.695 --> 02:23:32.697]  What would you do if you were the father of Ronald Madison and they admitted they murdered him to you?
[02:23:33.017 --> 02:23:36.059]  I can't believe Mr. Madison's father just stood there and took it.
[02:23:36.279 --> 02:23:41.621]  Well, you know, Alex, he died about two or three years after his son was killed.
[02:23:42.621 --> 02:23:43.402]  He didn't last.
[02:23:44.522 --> 02:23:46.183]  It was very sad because...
[02:23:47.614 --> 02:23:49.675]  You know, I think he died of a broken heart.
[02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:54.538]  So he didn't last long after his son was killed.
[02:23:55.098 --> 02:23:58.100]  Well, I tell you what, these scums just need to be brought to justice.
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:23:59.340]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:00.921]  You said folks could contact you.
[02:24:00.941 --> 02:24:02.542]  How do they do that, sir?
[02:24:02.642 --> 02:24:09.686]  They can contact me at gordon underscore bell nine at hotmail dot com.
[02:24:10.439 --> 02:24:15.060]  Gordon underscore bell nine at hotmail.com.
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:15.640]  That's correct.
[02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:19.021]  All right, we'll get a contact up there for you on the website.
[02:24:19.061 --> 02:24:21.121]  Sir, Godspeed, and good job exposing.
[02:24:21.461 --> 02:24:22.361]  And good luck to you, Alex.
[02:24:22.781 --> 02:24:23.061]  You bet.
[02:24:23.081 --> 02:24:23.642]  Take care.
[02:24:23.742 --> 02:24:24.082]  Bye-bye.
[02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.222]  Now, I know we've got callers holding for eons.
[02:24:26.262 --> 02:24:34.284]  I'm going to go to you now, and we'll see how many are still there, and then we'll... There's a bunch of other news I want to hit, too, but just a personal case of this, okay?
[02:24:34.704 --> 02:24:36.264]  Personal case of what's going on.
[02:24:37.144 --> 02:24:40.366]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[02:24:40.426 --> 02:24:41.267]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:24:42.167 --> 02:24:42.807]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:43.648 --> 02:24:44.568]  Great show, Alex.
[02:24:44.668 --> 02:24:54.094]  And, you know, how much more proof do people need that the only reason this kind of activity could be occurring on people, or even animals, these people, these beings are devils.
[02:24:54.114 --> 02:25:00.977]  They're not even human because it's incomprehensible when you hear these stories that other people could do this to other people.
[02:25:00.997 --> 02:25:02.038]  I mean, you know it's a poison.
[02:25:02.078 --> 02:25:02.818]  I'm a scientist.
[02:25:02.838 --> 02:25:04.159]  Hey, it's a poison.
[02:25:04.459 --> 02:25:05.340]  You know it's deadly.
[02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:11.563]  You don't have to torture any creatures to verify the exact details of what the poison does.
[02:25:11.643 --> 02:25:12.923]  It's deadly to begin with.
[02:25:12.983 --> 02:25:19.146]  Well, actually, you do want to test it, but it's already been developed for decades and tested, and they can do the exact same thing on rats and monkeys.
[02:25:19.506 --> 02:25:26.969]  The nervous systems have identical responses with almost every pathogen or every chemical or poison out there.
[02:25:27.049 --> 02:25:30.171]  But they do this to test groups of killers.
[02:25:30.231 --> 02:25:33.712]  They do this to warp the minds and to test their servants.
[02:25:34.152 --> 02:25:35.213]  That's what it's really about.
[02:25:35.533 --> 02:25:36.133]  Yes, that's right.
[02:25:36.173 --> 02:25:41.916]  But just the nature of these dangerous poisons, you know, it's ungodly even to create them.
[02:25:41.936 --> 02:25:45.058]  There's no good that can come from them except some kind of harm.
[02:25:45.498 --> 02:25:47.379]  So you see the futility of it all.
[02:25:47.659 --> 02:25:54.342]  But America has to give up all its rights because the terrorists are going to get us with the VX and the Sarin.
[02:25:54.922 --> 02:25:58.043]  Yes, Alex, and you know, these anarchists that called a while back
[02:26:16.447 --> 02:26:17.508]  I guess they don't understand.
[02:26:17.528 --> 02:26:20.409]  We have the freest, we had anyway.
[02:26:20.489 --> 02:26:27.712]  Our country was based on, and for the first hundred years it existed as, the freest government in the world where the people were the government.
[02:26:27.932 --> 02:26:33.135]  There's no, what anarchists are searching for, our country established ultimate freedom.
[02:26:33.575 --> 02:26:40.098]  You do whatever you want, I do whatever I want, I just don't interfere with you, and whatever we do otherwise is in the eyes of God.
[02:26:41.819 --> 02:26:46.423]  Yeah, they think our current form of government is the Republic.
[02:26:46.523 --> 02:26:49.306]  They think that this is America.
[02:26:49.386 --> 02:26:51.968]  No, this is the opposite of what we were founded on.
[02:26:51.988 --> 02:26:53.610]  That's right, exactly, Alex.
[02:26:55.848 --> 02:26:58.749]  George Washington, still the greatest American.
[02:26:58.990 --> 02:27:00.590]  Nobody's been so protected.
[02:27:00.890 --> 02:27:02.611]  The guy was offered to be king.
[02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:05.493]  The people, his soldiers looked up to him.
[02:27:05.893 --> 02:27:07.414]  Alex, can I just turn down over to Blake?
[02:27:07.434 --> 02:27:08.114]  No, I've got to let you go.
[02:27:08.134 --> 02:27:09.014]  I've got to let you go.
[02:27:09.034 --> 02:27:10.015]  I've got a lot of other callers.
[02:27:10.235 --> 02:27:11.155]  I've got a lot of other news.
[02:27:11.175 --> 02:27:14.797]  See, I never end up getting to the other callers, because I'll keep a caller on 10, 15 minutes.
[02:27:14.857 --> 02:27:16.518]  I've got to let you go, sir.
[02:27:16.618 --> 02:27:23.341]  Good call, but I've got to move on so we can give a chance to John and Keith and Kenneth and Dave and many others.
[02:27:23.361 --> 02:27:25.182]  And I've got some other news I need to cover.
[02:27:25.831 --> 02:27:27.854]  Some other news that needs to be detailed.
[02:27:28.295 --> 02:27:28.916]  Stay with us.
[02:27:28.976 --> 02:27:30.257]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.044 --> 02:27:35.966]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.446 --> 02:27:38.069]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.970 --> 02:27:41.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:50.188]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:27:50.488 --> 02:27:52.730]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[02:27:52.790 --> 02:28:00.257]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:28:00.597 --> 02:28:03.620]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:07.363]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:28:07.683 --> 02:28:17.053]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:28:17.293 --> 02:28:20.797]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:28:21.037 --> 02:28:28.145]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:28:45.066 --> 02:28:51.430]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:56.654]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:28:56.994 --> 02:29:04.899]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:29:05.059 --> 02:29:12.104]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:29:12.304 --> 02:29:13.525]  There are no side effects.
[02:29:13.665 --> 02:29:17.068]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:29:17.129 --> 02:29:18.230]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:19.811]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:29:20.011 --> 02:29:26.838]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:29:26.958 --> 02:29:29.400]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:29:32.601 --> 02:29:33.542]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:29:44.361 --> 02:29:46.443]  Cool weather brings cool cars.
[02:29:46.863 --> 02:29:47.764]  I don't think so.
[02:29:48.084 --> 02:29:51.707]  A cooling system can run too hot or too cold if not prepared for winter.
[02:29:52.087 --> 02:29:53.108]  Here's your to-do.
[02:29:53.328 --> 02:29:56.091]  Ask your local shop to perform the BG Coolant Flush.
[02:29:56.291 --> 02:30:01.935]  A simple test strip tells if your coolant's protecting the engine from temperature extremes or breaking down and corroding.
[02:30:02.296 --> 02:30:06.459]  The BG chemistry cleans the system, then adds new coolant with conditioners.
[02:30:06.699 --> 02:30:11.543]  Ask your shop for a BG Coolant Flush or go to bgfindashop.com.
[02:30:11.763 --> 02:30:13.485]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:30:14.403 --> 02:30:16.064]  Find your clean shop at BGFindAShop.com That's BGFindAShop.com
[02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:50.207]  Alright, I'll be able to take five more calls before this broadcast ends.
[02:30:50.267 --> 02:30:52.130]  So everybody be patient, we'll get to you.
[02:30:52.731 --> 02:30:57.360]  I want to talk about how they have repassed and radically expanded the Patriot Act.
[02:30:58.024 --> 02:31:07.686]  And then we posted an AP article, but it's really disinformation, so I may have to pull the article until we can write a comment on it, because you read the article and it's, oh, it got really weakened for your liberties.
[02:31:08.106 --> 02:31:09.486]  It's a lot better now.
[02:31:09.526 --> 02:31:10.946]  The people won.
[02:31:11.627 --> 02:31:24.749]  Meanwhile, it's a radical expansion, secret national police forces, Homeland Security under Patriot Act, scanning everything you're buying, the over-the-counter drugs, just section after section of pure evil.
[02:31:25.609 --> 02:31:29.150]  And by the time it hits the news, big victory for civil liberties activists.
[02:31:29.610 --> 02:31:31.250]  Patriot Act got restricted.
[02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:34.931]  That way, when the globalists carry out another terror attack, they'll go, look, you restricted it.
[02:31:34.951 --> 02:31:36.671]  And they'll have their cake and eat it, too.
[02:31:36.691 --> 02:31:37.792]  It'll really be much stronger.
[02:31:37.812 --> 02:31:38.652]  But then they'll say, see?
[02:31:38.952 --> 02:31:39.752]  You restricted it.
[02:31:40.012 --> 02:31:41.492]  You caused the terrorists to hit.
[02:31:41.693 --> 02:31:44.413]  Now it's illegal to criticize our security operations.
[02:31:44.773 --> 02:31:45.933]  You know, they've been calling for that.
[02:31:46.314 --> 02:31:48.794]  You're really fifth columnists for Al-Qaeda.
[02:31:49.534 --> 02:31:52.775]  By the way, we're going to nerve gas some more troops, but that's freedom.
[02:31:53.275 --> 02:31:58.856]  I mean, can you imagine if Al-Qaeda nerve gas was real and really nerve gassed some troops?
[02:31:58.956 --> 02:31:59.956]  It'd be endless headlines.
[02:31:59.997 --> 02:32:02.657]  But our government does it, and it's good.
[02:32:03.097 --> 02:32:05.318]  Murdering our troops is good.
[02:32:05.618 --> 02:32:06.918]  It's America.
[02:32:07.258 --> 02:32:08.158]  It's England.
[02:32:08.258 --> 02:32:11.399]  It's the stars and bars.
[02:32:11.499 --> 02:32:13.639]  It's all of it.
[02:32:13.679 --> 02:32:15.060]  It's the Union Jack.
[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:15.980]  It's freedom.
[02:32:17.771 --> 02:32:19.212]  Oh, that Alex Jones is bad.
[02:32:19.252 --> 02:32:20.973]  He shouldn't be upset about what's happening.
[02:32:21.333 --> 02:32:24.075]  Before I go to your calls, we have the citizen rule books in.
[02:32:24.555 --> 02:32:25.616]  Years ago I offered these.
[02:32:25.656 --> 02:32:35.122]  Well, every order you make, one DVD, one book, whatever it is, you get this little color 62-page booklet with the jury handbook.
[02:32:36.596 --> 02:32:44.398]  And the Grand Jury Handbook and famous quotes, Give Me Liberty by Patrick Henry, Jury of Peers, Freedom, Fort William Penn, Jefferson's Warnings.
[02:32:44.878 --> 02:32:50.339]  You get the original documents, the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, and so much more.
[02:32:50.399 --> 02:32:53.520]  I mean, there are a lot of these little pamphlets and books out there.
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:54.320]  This is the best.
[02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:55.140]  I've got a bunch of them.
[02:32:55.580 --> 02:32:59.081]  This is the best company that puts them out out of Arizona, out of Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:32:59.781 --> 02:33:01.122]  And these things have done a lot of good.
[02:33:01.242 --> 02:33:01.802]  Ten of them for $10.
[02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:07.381]  Or you can get 20 for like $17 or 30 for... It goes down.
[02:33:07.621 --> 02:33:10.822]  And we are selling these basically at cost.
[02:33:12.303 --> 02:33:15.944]  They're like 45, 50 cents a piece for us, buying thousands of them at a time.
[02:33:16.864 --> 02:33:18.464]  And then you buy them for a dollar.
[02:33:18.504 --> 02:33:24.406]  That just barely pays for us putting them in the shipping and sending them out to you and taking care of it and processing your order.
[02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:25.650]  We're good to go.
[02:33:44.191 --> 02:33:47.453]  If you can memorize this, or at least have a grasp of it.
[02:33:48.233 --> 02:33:52.375]  Okay, you want to be able to go on that trip with your friends camping.
[02:33:52.536 --> 02:33:56.678]  Or, okay, you want some new tires for that car you just bought with your own money.
[02:33:57.038 --> 02:33:58.499]  Okay, I'll buy you new tires.
[02:33:58.539 --> 02:34:02.741]  I mean, it's that important, folks, that people learn this.
[02:34:02.761 --> 02:34:03.962]  And I bet you don't know it.
[02:34:04.002 --> 02:34:06.963]  I bet you know more than most people, because you're a listener of this broadcast.
[02:34:07.223 --> 02:34:08.264]  Some of you know more than I do.
[02:34:08.284 --> 02:34:12.166]  I mean, frankly, I know some of you are a lot smarter than I am.
[02:34:12.944 --> 02:34:13.764]  Just get it.
[02:34:14.705 --> 02:34:15.865]  Get the Citizen Rulebook.
[02:34:15.905 --> 02:34:24.507]  And then while you're at it, on the shopping cart at Infowars.com, get some of the new DVDs and books we carry and videos and T-shirts.
[02:34:24.667 --> 02:34:28.328]  All the materials we have are about getting the word out, fighting the New World Order.
[02:34:28.588 --> 02:34:34.370]  You're authorized to make copies of all of my films for educational, not-for-profit purposes to affect change.
[02:34:34.810 --> 02:34:37.291]  And if you've got a book or video you want us to carry, we might do that.
[02:34:37.331 --> 02:34:40.853]  Send us a copy of it, and we'll think about adding it to the library that we carry.
[02:34:41.193 --> 02:34:42.974]  But seriously, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:34:43.014 --> 02:34:45.535]  Remember, your purchase makes this broadcast possible.
[02:34:46.215 --> 02:34:51.158]  And if you want any of the big Berkey water filters, we have the new sports filter with the free gift up there.
[02:34:51.218 --> 02:34:55.640]  We have the travel filtration systems made in America.
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:34:58.201]  We offer the British-made Berkeys if you want those.
[02:34:58.241 --> 02:35:01.863]  But we have made-in-America Berkeys that are even at a higher standard.
[02:35:02.183 --> 02:35:04.064]  University studies show the British filters.
[02:35:04.384 --> 02:35:07.827]  But we have Made in America, but England, U.S., same thing again, so it doesn't really matter.
[02:35:07.847 --> 02:35:09.928]  But we have Made in America filters if you want them.
[02:35:09.948 --> 02:35:10.829]  That's what I recommend.
[02:35:11.949 --> 02:35:13.531]  It's New Millennium that makes these.
[02:35:13.591 --> 02:35:16.393]  It's an American company, so you can't beat that.
[02:35:16.473 --> 02:35:18.074]  And it's at wholesale prices.
[02:35:18.094 --> 02:35:26.720]  So go to InfoWars.com while you're on the SecureSafe shopping cart and click on the Better Living Through Clean Water section and look at all the different filters we offer.
[02:35:27.621 --> 02:35:29.462]  Or, better yet, call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:38.283]  Make an answer, all your questions, and take your order at 888-253-3139.
[02:35:38.844 --> 02:35:48.271]  Or you can go right to the source and get it for the exact same price, but get it from the lady who is the real expert, Debbie Morrow from New Millennium Concepts.
[02:35:48.371 --> 02:35:56.098]  And, Debbie, you join us here for just a few minutes, and we're going to be getting you on a lot more here in the near future because it's important that people get prepared.
[02:35:57.579 --> 02:35:59.340]  Debbie, tell us about some of the new specials.
[02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:03.924]  Well, the Travel Berkey is our newest product line that we have available.
[02:36:04.392 --> 02:36:17.125]  And it's a stainless steel travel Berkey even available in California because it is a travel Berkey, although it has the same exact filters and same stainless steel as the big Berkey for your California listeners.
[02:36:17.606 --> 02:36:23.212]  If you've been waiting to get a stainless steel unit in your house or in your trailer, boat, RV,
[02:36:23.939 --> 02:36:25.861]  You can now order the Travel Berkey.
[02:36:25.921 --> 02:36:26.581]  No, no, no.
[02:36:26.641 --> 02:36:30.764]  I get calls saying, what does it mean not available in California or Iowa?
[02:36:30.784 --> 02:36:33.647]  For those who don't know, L.A.
[02:36:33.727 --> 02:36:34.547]  is toilet to tap.
[02:36:34.727 --> 02:36:35.808]  You actually drink toilet water.
[02:36:37.109 --> 02:36:38.831]  That's the water you and your family get.
[02:36:39.551 --> 02:36:43.074]  It has been taken out of the sewers, out of the water treatment plants.
[02:36:43.874 --> 02:36:50.199]  But they have these incredible regulations for anybody that wants to sell water filters there, and New Millennium is not going to jump through those hoops.
[02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:52.101]  Right, but what's really neat is,
[02:36:52.481 --> 02:36:57.726]  Is because the Travel Berkey is called the Travel Berkey, then we can sell it in California.
[02:36:57.786 --> 02:37:04.612]  And, of course, you can get the Berkey Lite in California because it's also considered for camping and stuff, even though you can use it wherever you want.
[02:37:05.092 --> 02:37:08.355]  So those are now available to ship to California.
[02:37:09.196 --> 02:37:13.279]  And you know how, Alex, you always get on the air and say, Oh, Debbie, send me one of those.
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.223]  I'm going to call Shirley and tell her that I want to buy a bunch of those books, too.
[02:37:17.674 --> 02:37:28.983]  Because I have a whole bunch of teenagers that come in and out of my house with having a 20-year-old son, and I want to get one of those books in the hands of every single one of them so they will learn.
[02:37:30.662 --> 02:37:31.743]  Well, Debbie, it's simple.
[02:37:31.803 --> 02:37:35.685]  The government isn't going to teach the children this in school.
[02:37:35.985 --> 02:37:39.087]  They're not going to be taught this even in a constitutional law class.
[02:37:39.327 --> 02:37:40.367]  They'll be taught a fraud.
[02:37:40.748 --> 02:37:44.209]  This is a 62-page booklet jam-packed with power.
[02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:47.151]  This is the rule book of being an American.
[02:37:47.591 --> 02:37:52.074]  And folks, get on your laptop computer, type up a 10-question test.
[02:37:52.134 --> 02:37:57.957]  Three on the Bill of Rights, three on the Constitution, one on the Declaration of Independence, another on something else.
[02:37:58.477 --> 02:38:04.621]  And then tell your son or daughter, hey, answer nine of these ten questions right, and you get $500.
[02:38:04.841 --> 02:38:09.904]  I mean, it is worth it to make your children do this.
[02:38:10.745 --> 02:38:11.905]  Yes, it really is.
[02:38:11.925 --> 02:38:16.248]  And so I'm really excited about that, to get it.
[02:38:16.268 --> 02:38:26.134]  But for the listeners who are calling in on the Travel Berkeys or the Berkey Lights or any of those, we have the Alex Jones specials available online.
[02:38:26.835 --> 02:38:33.037]  And all they have to do is tell me that you're a listener and we'll be sure to give you your free gift with your order.
[02:38:33.717 --> 02:38:39.719]  And you can call toll-free 1-888-803-4438.
[02:38:40.759 --> 02:38:47.741]  I did have the opportunity to meet one of your listeners this morning who I needed to get some filters into their hands right away.
[02:38:47.761 --> 02:38:53.963]  And Alex, they told me to send their regards and that they listen to you in the Dallas area every day.
[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:56.640]  Everybody's listening.
[02:38:57.201 --> 02:39:00.542]  Well, Debbie, that's certainly good news, and I appreciate you joining us.
[02:39:01.422 --> 02:39:03.442]  And we'll be talking to you in the next few days, Debbie.
[02:39:03.703 --> 02:39:04.483]  Okie dokie.
[02:39:04.523 --> 02:39:05.383]  Thank you very much.
[02:39:05.483 --> 02:39:11.285]  And lines are busy, but I promise I will call people back, or you can keep calling, and I'll get to you, okay?
[02:39:11.485 --> 02:39:11.765]  Okay.
[02:39:11.785 --> 02:39:12.325]  Thank you, Debbie.
[02:39:13.565 --> 02:39:15.486]  Folks, if you want to give Debbie a call, it's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:39:15.506 --> 02:39:22.288]  A lot of different specials, a lot of different deals, free gifts with all your orders.
[02:39:23.084 --> 02:39:30.348]  Or you can go to Infowars.com and order the exact same things, exact same price, and we fax those orders over to them every day so they get them that way.
[02:39:30.648 --> 02:39:33.370]  And then you also, in the comments section, tell them what free gift you want.
[02:39:33.730 --> 02:39:35.911]  And again, that's at Infowars.com or 888-253-3139 or 888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[02:39:35.931 --> 02:39:38.112]  Go directly to their website and do it as well.
[02:39:38.232 --> 02:39:39.193]  Okay, that out of the way.
[02:39:49.118 --> 02:39:50.319]  By the way, it's made in America.
[02:39:50.339 --> 02:39:50.879]  I believe in it.
[02:39:51.159 --> 02:39:58.302]  And they fund our entire shortwave outreach, which is a global reach for WWCR, and we really do appreciate them.
[02:39:59.162 --> 02:39:59.542]  All right.
[02:40:00.283 --> 02:40:04.504]  Let us now go ahead and go to the ring of dinghies here.
[02:40:05.945 --> 02:40:10.027]  Let's talk to John in Colorado, who's up next.
[02:40:10.067 --> 02:40:10.767]  Go ahead, John.
[02:40:11.007 --> 02:40:11.327]  Yeah.
[02:40:11.387 --> 02:40:12.768]  Can you hear me?
[02:40:13.348 --> 02:40:13.848]  Yes, I can.
[02:40:13.868 --> 02:40:14.408]  Can you hear me?
[02:40:14.668 --> 02:40:14.848]  Yes.
[02:40:15.169 --> 02:40:15.389]  Good.
[02:40:15.409 --> 02:40:15.909]  Okay.
[02:40:16.894 --> 02:40:34.365]  Yeah, I was talking to someone in one of my classes a while ago, and he said, because I wanted to ask you about Noam Chomsky, because I asked him, you know, because I was telling him about InfoWars and all that, and he said he didn't like you or any of the stuff you did because you said something bad about Noam Chomsky.
[02:40:34.565 --> 02:40:35.946]  Yeah, I sure did.
[02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:36.486]  I interviewed him.
[02:40:36.506 --> 02:40:44.371]  Well, I was just wondering what he was talking about, because I didn't know anything about that.
[02:40:44.391 --> 02:40:45.052]  What did you...
[02:40:46.215 --> 02:40:48.616]  I mean, is he involved in bad stuff?
[02:40:48.816 --> 02:40:56.780]  Yeah, I mean, he's an MIT Defense Department paid little minion, and it takes an hour to go over what's wrong with him.
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:02.702]  But I interviewed the guy for an hour, and he hung up near the end of it because he just wouldn't face the facts.
[02:41:02.742 --> 02:41:04.703]  He's one of these people who thinks they're God.
[02:41:05.507 --> 02:41:05.867]  We're good to go.
[02:41:05.887 --> 02:41:06.608]  We're good to go.
[02:41:28.411 --> 02:41:29.392]  He's for globalization.
[02:41:29.412 --> 02:41:30.492]  He's for getting rid of our borders.
[02:41:30.532 --> 02:41:33.313]  He claims that the global corporations run things.
[02:41:33.353 --> 02:41:34.274]  Well, of course they do.
[02:41:34.494 --> 02:41:37.555]  But then he supports nine of their ten major goals.
[02:41:37.976 --> 02:41:47.480]  Yeah, so that's what I wanted to find out, was that if he was in on bad stuff, claiming to be someone who's, you know, fighting against, you know, controlled media and all this stuff.
[02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:48.921]  Yeah, it's totally verifiable.
[02:41:48.941 --> 02:41:50.661]  Listen, listen, the guy is a joke.
[02:41:50.761 --> 02:41:56.404]  Look, I read globalist policy papers eight, nine years ago saying the people are waking up to global government.
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:41:59.821]  The people are realizing that we're running a scam on them.
[02:41:59.861 --> 02:42:02.863]  We've got to give them a fake left-right choice.
[02:42:03.523 --> 02:42:11.286]  And so they go, oh, there's a loving liberal UN who's against attacking countries, but they have a good global government.
[02:42:11.627 --> 02:42:14.388]  And oh, there's the evil right-wing American George Bush.
[02:42:14.728 --> 02:42:17.910]  Republican global government, which side will you join?
[02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:27.817]  And so then they shut down the debate about, we don't want a global government, into what do you want the left or the right, which is a global model of the same controlled paradigm here domestically.
[02:42:28.558 --> 02:42:39.946]  Right, because that's what I wanted to find out, was if he's one of those controlled opposition kind of... Well, I mean, listen, Frank Church did the groundbreaking work on the media being controlled by the government.
[02:42:41.601 --> 02:42:43.942]  Chomsky mainly focuses on corporations.
[02:42:43.962 --> 02:42:45.103]  Well, that's the same thing.
[02:42:45.443 --> 02:42:53.826]  And, you know, I can go read a document about Mosaddegh written by Kermit Roosevelt that's got more about CIA controlling our media than Chomsky ever wrote in one of his books.
[02:42:54.948 --> 02:42:57.389]  I mean, I've seen him give little speeches.
[02:42:57.409 --> 02:42:58.769]  I've gone to see him speak.
[02:42:58.809 --> 02:43:04.471]  I mean, I have nothing against Chomsky himself until I interviewed him and really researched what he was up to.
[02:43:05.011 --> 02:43:06.592]  And people go, what about Chomsky?
[02:43:06.632 --> 02:43:07.452]  As if saying the name.
[02:43:07.832 --> 02:43:08.512]  Chomsky.
[02:43:08.532 --> 02:43:10.273]  And I'm supposed to go, oh, Chomsky.
[02:43:10.293 --> 02:43:11.633]  Chomsky.
[02:43:11.713 --> 02:43:12.633]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:43:12.673 --> 02:43:17.835]  The man is just a... Frankly, there are hundreds of researchers that make him look like a doddering idiot.
[02:43:18.456 --> 02:43:23.822]  I mean, you want real scholarly research about somebody like Webster Tarpley.
[02:43:24.302 --> 02:43:29.327]  I mean, listen, we're not here just attacking other intellectuals because we can't handle it.
[02:43:29.387 --> 02:43:33.992]  No, I'm just telling you, Chomsky is so bad, it would take hours to go over all of it.
[02:43:34.352 --> 02:43:36.113]  Yeah, okay, yeah, because that's what I wanted to know.
[02:43:36.153 --> 02:43:38.115]  I mean, I don't believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:43:38.435 --> 02:43:41.277]  Anybody with a thimble, he doesn't even believe there was prior knowledge.
[02:43:41.498 --> 02:43:43.799]  He doesn't even believe that they laid down and let it happen.
[02:43:43.839 --> 02:43:51.345]  Right, because I just wanted to know if he was one of those people, because, I mean, everybody defends him, you know, and he's got, he's supposedly... He's a sniveling worm.
[02:43:51.565 --> 02:43:53.547]  Okay, good, because that's what I wanted to know, if he's...
[02:43:54.267 --> 02:44:01.293]  That's why I wanted to know if he's one of those people that pretend to be... We're not even powerful enough or smart enough to even say his name.
[02:44:02.213 --> 02:44:03.394]  Chomsky.
[02:44:03.414 --> 02:44:05.236]  I mean, we just don't get it.
[02:44:05.276 --> 02:44:06.897]  We just don't get the intellect.
[02:44:07.678 --> 02:44:09.659]  Yeah.
[02:44:09.719 --> 02:44:13.623]  I mean, really, the UN's good, and our government doesn't control it.
[02:44:13.843 --> 02:44:15.204]  He actually said that on my show.
[02:44:16.113 --> 02:44:19.856]  The UN isn't controlled by the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:44:19.876 --> 02:44:22.638]  He doesn't know what the Anglo-American establishment is.
[02:44:22.778 --> 02:44:35.368]  When top political scientists, mentors to George Bush and Bill Clinton have openly said, it is global government, we are the new world order, we are going to give you one world government, we control the left and right, Chomsky doesn't even know what that is.
[02:44:36.589 --> 02:44:39.151]  Yeah, because I was telling him,
[02:44:39.642 --> 02:44:45.046]  Talking to my, that kid in that class, and that's why he didn't like you, and that's why I wanted to call and find out, because I didn't know.
[02:44:45.066 --> 02:44:46.546]  Because he's really smart.
[02:44:46.566 --> 02:44:47.687]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:44:48.328 --> 02:44:52.630]  He sat there at a coffee shop acting like he was reading a Chomsky book.
[02:44:52.650 --> 02:44:57.974]  Yeah, because I just want to, because, you know, you've got to be careful about who you, you know, who you listen to.
[02:44:57.994 --> 02:45:00.215]  But wait, I'm going to try to say it again.
[02:45:00.856 --> 02:45:07.300]  Chom, Chom, Chomsky, oh, I said it all, I'm an intellectual, oh.
[02:45:07.340 --> 02:45:07.580]  Okay.
[02:45:09.665 --> 02:45:12.926]  It's just like Michael Savage, okay, on the other side.
[02:45:12.946 --> 02:45:14.206]  They're both dirty beatniks.
[02:45:14.606 --> 02:45:18.147]  Michael Savage, big greaseball beatnik of the 60s, so evil.
[02:45:18.167 --> 02:45:19.228]  I mean, read the books he wrote.
[02:45:19.248 --> 02:45:20.988]  I actually didn't believe it when I read it online.
[02:45:21.348 --> 02:45:22.789]  I went and bought one of the books.
[02:45:23.189 --> 02:45:26.050]  I mean, friends with people like Allen Ginsberg.
[02:45:26.090 --> 02:45:28.850]  I mean, folks, I don't need to even begin to try to tell you.
[02:45:28.910 --> 02:45:29.671]  It is sick.
[02:45:30.231 --> 02:45:31.111]  It is sick.
[02:45:31.781 --> 02:45:34.223]  I mean, this guy is conservatives only now.
[02:45:34.683 --> 02:45:37.225]  And meanwhile, he always wanted to put Americans in camps.
[02:45:37.265 --> 02:45:38.666]  He always wanted to bring this country down.
[02:45:39.186 --> 02:45:39.586]  Okay?
[02:45:40.287 --> 02:45:41.528]  He is sick.
[02:45:42.128 --> 02:45:46.291]  And then now he is the ultimate conservative saying, put everyone in camps.
[02:45:46.731 --> 02:45:49.453]  You know, we've got to fight the New World Order by attacking all these countries.
[02:45:49.473 --> 02:45:50.794]  Well, that's what the New World Order is.
[02:45:51.274 --> 02:45:52.475]  And his real name is Weiner.
[02:45:53.055 --> 02:45:57.999]  And he's the same thing to Republicans that Chomsky is to, quote, progressive Democrats.
[02:45:58.759 --> 02:45:59.640]  He's a foil.
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:02.241]  He's out there moiling around for the New World Order.
[02:46:02.281 --> 02:46:02.821]  He's a fake.
[02:46:02.841 --> 02:46:03.542]  He's a shill.
[02:46:03.562 --> 02:46:11.726]  That's good, because I just wanted to know if he was one of those kinds of people, because there's a lot of people out there that pretend to be against this kind of thing.
[02:46:11.806 --> 02:46:15.267]  Well, yeah, that's about all I wanted to know.
[02:46:15.288 --> 02:46:17.369]  Yeah, let me tell you something.
[02:46:17.409 --> 02:46:19.330]  A real professor starts blowing the whistle.
[02:46:19.650 --> 02:46:21.070]  They get their tenure revoked.
[02:46:21.130 --> 02:46:22.011]  They get kicked out.
[02:46:22.031 --> 02:46:22.931]  They don't get any funding.
[02:46:23.292 --> 02:46:27.654]  What does Chomsky get at one of the central cores of the New World Order at MIT?
[02:46:29.759 --> 02:46:30.379]  I don't know.
[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:33.541]  He's a gibbering joke.
[02:46:33.702 --> 02:46:34.302]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:34.322 --> 02:46:38.244]  A gibbering joke is what Noam Chomsky is.
[02:46:39.665 --> 02:46:41.066]  You just don't understand him.
[02:46:41.086 --> 02:46:42.787]  You don't understand at all.
[02:46:43.988 --> 02:46:47.950]  It makes sense because most of it's true, but a large portion is malarkey.
[02:46:49.731 --> 02:46:50.472]  Oh, please.
[02:46:51.012 --> 02:46:52.673]  Stop looking for leaders like Chomsky.
[02:46:52.693 --> 02:46:53.534]  Be a leader yourself.
[02:46:54.294 --> 02:46:57.736]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:46:57.776 --> 02:46:58.617]  Who's up next in order?
[02:47:00.129 --> 02:47:00.969]  James in Maryland?
[02:47:02.670 --> 02:47:02.970]  Hello?
[02:47:03.191 --> 02:47:04.051]  Yes, sir, you're on the air.
[02:47:04.091 --> 02:47:04.771]  Go ahead, James.
[02:47:05.011 --> 02:47:13.856]  Yeah, I heard the caller earlier talking about the cop that ordered that man on the ground and then ordered him to get up and shot him three times.
[02:47:13.976 --> 02:47:14.336]  Yes.
[02:47:14.656 --> 02:47:16.237]  That was on Fox.
[02:47:17.437 --> 02:47:18.338]  He deserved it.
[02:47:18.358 --> 02:47:19.579]  He met him with alcohol.
[02:47:19.819 --> 02:47:22.260]  Well, what they had was... We all deserve to be killed.
[02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:23.240]  Government's God.
[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:24.481]  Hail, hail government!
[02:47:24.661 --> 02:47:26.062]  I'm sorry, I just can't control myself.
[02:47:26.382 --> 02:47:28.563]  They had the spin doctor on there saying how...
[02:47:29.164 --> 02:47:33.491]  You've got to look at the police officer's state of mind.
[02:47:33.511 --> 02:47:36.275]  Exactly!
[02:47:36.596 --> 02:47:37.397]  Exactly!
[02:47:37.597 --> 02:47:39.140]  What I saw, Alex, was...
[02:47:39.679 --> 02:47:40.860]  He ordered the man on the ground.
[02:47:40.900 --> 02:47:41.700]  He got on the ground.
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:43.201]  He ordered the man to stand up.
[02:47:43.661 --> 02:47:45.823]  While he was standing up, he shot him three times.
[02:47:45.983 --> 02:47:47.324]  Well, sir, they always slip up.
[02:47:47.384 --> 02:47:56.629]  Cops all the time blow people away when they're in handcuffs or down on the ground, and they always won't just say, hey, I slipped up and pulled the trigger and then freaked out and pulled it two more times.
[02:47:56.649 --> 02:48:03.153]  You've got a bunch of low-grade moron idiots who've been playing violent video games their whole life who think they're warriors.
[02:48:03.213 --> 02:48:04.274]  A cop isn't a warrior.
[02:48:04.294 --> 02:48:06.635]  He's a defender, a peacekeeper, a servant.
[02:48:06.835 --> 02:48:07.616]  They don't know that.
[02:48:07.656 --> 02:48:12.038]  They're roid heads listening to death metal who don't even know their head from a hole in the ground.
[02:48:12.058 --> 02:48:13.079]  They're going to kill people.
[02:48:13.639 --> 02:48:15.260]  And that's what the government wants, brother.
[02:48:16.041 --> 02:48:22.485]  So, I've got to find out about this incident and write an article about it or I'll get my weevils on it.
[02:48:22.545 --> 02:48:23.345]  But anything else?
[02:48:23.786 --> 02:48:31.130]  Yeah, could you talk about Schwarzenegger's plans for running for the presidency, if that's going to happen?
[02:48:31.150 --> 02:48:35.073]  Well, that's getting in a lot of trouble thanks to a fight named Al Slander.
[02:48:36.044 --> 02:48:37.286]  Another piece of trash.
[02:48:37.366 --> 02:48:38.508]  Thinks he's going to run this country.
[02:48:38.548 --> 02:48:39.429]  Another piece of filth.
[02:48:39.889 --> 02:48:41.251]  Openly says he wants to be a dictator.
[02:48:45.778 --> 02:48:47.380]  What really happened September 11th?
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:48.682]  And who stands to gain?
[02:48:49.366 --> 02:48:50.667]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:49:06.774 --> 02:49:10.536]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:10.796 --> 02:49:15.378]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:15.498 --> 02:49:21.761]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.821 --> 02:49:23.682]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:50:04.901 --> 02:50:06.183]  To below detectable levels.

[02:50:10.627 --> 02:50:17.155]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:17.375 --> 02:50:22.861]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[02:51:53.826 --> 02:52:01.450]  Yes, I'm McKean Weevil here at this operation, eating into the lies of the New World Order.
[02:52:03.752 --> 02:52:10.895]  Trying to screw up their scheme to enslave all of us, trying to get you to wake up to the fact you're under attack by the NWO, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:12.636 --> 02:52:20.881]  Yeah, Kevin out there outside the studio just mentioned, I remember reading this, Chomsky doesn't believe anyone but Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy.
[02:52:20.961 --> 02:52:21.401]  I mean, just...
[02:52:23.152 --> 02:52:24.813]  The guy's a joke, okay?
[02:52:25.453 --> 02:52:27.855]  Let's go ahead and talk to James.
[02:52:29.536 --> 02:52:31.517]  Keith in Ohio, then Scott and Fred.
[02:52:31.537 --> 02:52:32.178]  Keith, go ahead.
[02:52:32.698 --> 02:52:34.279]  Alex, keep up the good research.
[02:52:34.299 --> 02:52:35.040]  It's so vital.
[02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:40.563]  I thank the Lord so much for America and our history in a multitude of ways.
[02:52:41.004 --> 02:52:47.528]  But the best, most ethical American without the Lord Jesus Christ will end up in eternal hell.
[02:52:48.582 --> 02:52:57.834]  And if they've not had their sins washed away by the blood of the Lord Jesus and haven't turned from that old sinful life, like your dramatization was showing, many Americans are full of pride.
[02:52:58.475 --> 02:52:59.196]  Pride is sin.
[02:52:59.236 --> 02:53:03.802]  If you look in Proverbs 6, certain things that God hates, a proud look.
[02:53:04.614 --> 02:53:05.574]  A lying tongue.
[02:53:05.594 --> 02:53:07.455]  Well, I'll agree with you on this, too.
[02:53:08.075 --> 02:53:13.717]  People are so prideful, they won't even admit there's a tyrannical government because that would make them feel weak.
[02:53:13.997 --> 02:53:15.337]  There ain't nothing holding me down.
[02:53:15.477 --> 02:53:17.758]  There's no threat to me and my family.
[02:53:18.498 --> 02:53:19.879]  Don't you dare tell me, boy!
[02:53:20.279 --> 02:53:23.400]  When you're in the camp of the... When you're in sin, you're in the camp of the enemies.
[02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:24.300]  You're joined with them.
[02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:26.160]  And then it says, the hands that shed innocent blood.
[02:53:26.201 --> 02:53:27.681]  We've killed a hundred million babies and then...
[02:53:28.191 --> 02:53:29.312]  These unjust wars.
[02:53:29.852 --> 02:53:30.772]  I thought it was like 48, 49.
[02:53:30.852 --> 02:53:35.155]  Pastor Randy Sanders has been involved for 30 years.
[02:53:35.215 --> 02:53:36.635]  He's posted 100 million.
[02:53:37.035 --> 02:53:39.657]  A heart that devises wicked imaginations.
[02:53:40.557 --> 02:53:41.418]  America, right here.
[02:53:41.758 --> 02:53:43.799]  Feast that be swift to running to mischief.
[02:53:44.019 --> 02:53:46.160]  A false witness that speaketh lies.
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:53.584]  And if people don't turn from their sins and get that new life in Christ, which is a gift, that's what's going to take us down is sin.
[02:53:54.942 --> 02:54:01.564]  And just like ancient Babylon did its evil and was used against Israel, and then God judged ancient Babylon... No, you're right.
[02:54:01.604 --> 02:54:03.065]  We'll go into captivity.
[02:54:03.605 --> 02:54:04.745]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:05.185 --> 02:54:05.826]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:05.846 --> 02:54:07.206]  I've got to move on to the last two callers.
[02:54:07.286 --> 02:54:19.410]  But I was reading Isaiah this weekend, and I circled it, meant to cover it on air, but it was a quote about the evil king and his evil judges and constantly lying and persecuting innocent people.
[02:54:19.790 --> 02:54:21.411]  I mean, if that ain't it today, I don't know what is.
[02:54:22.051 --> 02:54:22.331]  Scott...
[02:54:23.462 --> 02:54:24.202]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:54:24.222 --> 02:54:25.122]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:54:25.323 --> 02:54:26.403]  Calling from California, Alex.
[02:54:26.423 --> 02:54:26.763]  Welcome, sir.
[02:54:26.783 --> 02:54:27.663]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:27.883 --> 02:54:28.123]  You bet.
[02:54:28.143 --> 02:54:28.463]  Go ahead.
[02:54:28.703 --> 02:54:32.304]  I'm a teacher, and I want to just encourage all of your listeners who are teachers.
[02:54:32.364 --> 02:54:34.805]  I know that teachers are concerned sometimes dealing with these issues.
[02:54:34.845 --> 02:54:36.845]  They think they may not have job security.
[02:54:36.865 --> 02:54:38.626]  They may get fired if they're too controversial.
[02:54:38.646 --> 02:54:39.506]  But let me tell you what.
[02:54:40.006 --> 02:54:44.087]  All you have to do is teach American history from an American perspective.
[02:54:44.127 --> 02:54:45.648]  I teach my kids about the Bill of Rights.
[02:54:45.688 --> 02:54:46.888]  They all know their Bill of Rights.
[02:54:47.898 --> 02:54:51.040]  I'm going to buy some of those citizens' rule books and hand them out to my kids.
[02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:55.323]  Yeah, you've got to do it carefully, but just off the real history itself.
[02:54:55.363 --> 02:54:59.285]  I mean, that guy, I listened to his 25-minute rant, agreed with about 80% of it.
[02:54:59.325 --> 02:55:00.326]  It doesn't matter.
[02:55:00.466 --> 02:55:03.327]  I wish my children would end up having teachers like that.
[02:55:03.608 --> 02:55:06.289]  I want them to have a fascist, a constitutionalist, a communist.
[02:55:06.609 --> 02:55:07.670]  I want them to hear it all.
[02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:10.352]  Instead, they don't hear any of it and don't even know what it is.
[02:55:10.572 --> 02:55:15.735]  That dumb kid should be glad he had a teacher like that, and his stupid parents should be even gladder.
[02:55:16.115 --> 02:55:16.555]  Exactly.
[02:55:16.575 --> 02:55:16.975]  You're right.
[02:55:17.075 --> 02:55:17.716]  And you know what?
[02:55:18.056 --> 02:55:26.580]  This generation of students, I teach high schoolers, and I asked my ninth graders the first week of school, how many of them think that the government had something to do with 9-11?
[02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:28.420]  Alex, half of them raised their hands.
[02:55:29.021 --> 02:55:29.321]  Half.
[02:55:32.022 --> 02:55:33.603]  You know, I'd like to have you on as a guest sometime.
[02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:35.484]  Just talk about being a modern school teacher.
[02:55:35.524 --> 02:55:36.604]  I guess you're in a public school?
[02:55:36.944 --> 02:55:37.825]  Actually, a private school.
[02:55:38.545 --> 02:55:40.126]  Oh, well, you can do whatever you want in there, hopefully.
[02:55:40.486 --> 02:55:43.187]  Yeah, well, not so much, but more than a public school.
[02:55:43.863 --> 02:55:50.365]  Well, I mean, it's despicable how they've canned this guy just for having his own view of the students.
[02:55:50.525 --> 02:55:51.565]  Oh, yeah, it's out of control.
[02:55:52.205 --> 02:55:53.706]  That's what teachers are supposed to do.
[02:55:53.726 --> 02:55:55.786]  Yeah, they're supposed to facilitate thinking.
[02:55:56.027 --> 02:55:58.487]  And then you teach your children to not believe everything they say.
[02:55:58.507 --> 02:55:59.428]  Yep, you're right.
[02:56:01.168 --> 02:56:08.510]  Well, I mean, if people don't know that indoctrination is going on, knowing about indoctrination, whether it's good, bad, or indifferent, that's the key.
[02:56:08.850 --> 02:56:11.131]  I'm sorry to Fred, but Scott, good talking to you.
[02:56:12.939 --> 02:56:14.020]  You're such great callers.
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:15.360]  You've got the best callers out there.
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:17.702]  I'm sorry we're out of time to all of those that are holding.
[02:56:17.722 --> 02:56:18.922]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:18.962 --> 02:56:19.903]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:20.203 --> 02:56:21.124]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.144 --> 02:56:22.684]  And expose this murdering scum!
