[00:00:05.858 --> 00:00:06.499]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.241]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.103]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:11.525]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:13.067]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.462]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:22.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:29.989]  Well, it's Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.910]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:42.936]  We have Major General Albert N. Stubblebine III joining us, and he was the head of the Pentagon's
[00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:48.908]  Well, what you could call remote viewing operations.
[00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.490]  And, you know, I don't get into a lot of this stuff.
[00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.753]  The reason we're reporting on it is because it's real, it's going on, the military believes in it.
[00:00:57.394 --> 00:01:06.280]  This guy was a, what, a three-star general and ran major operations at Fort Bragg and all over the country and worldwide as well.
[00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.843]  He'll be joining us coming up in the third hour.
[00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:13.645]  His wife, who's very interesting in her own right,
[00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:25.802]  Reema Labow, MD, she's a medical doctor, will be exposing the Codex Alimentarius, the move to ban vitamins for over-the-counter sale and a lot more.
[00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:31.025]  I thought, why don't I just have them both on today and get into the attack on vitamins and alternative medicine.
[00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:32.346]  Again, she's a medical doctor.
[00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:40.311]  And then we're going to have her husband, Mr. Stubblebine on, who's on the board of a Submarine Company, the father of remote viewing.
[00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:50.098]  This is some wild stuff, and it's coming up today on this Live Friday edition.
[00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:55.799]  In the meantime, it's kind of a variety show of bizarreness today.
[00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.720]  Alligator likely stalked jogger on land before attack.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.861]  This alligator grabbed a woman jogger, killed her,
[00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:10.723]  And of course, alligators are like cockroaches in the Florida Everglades and in Louisiana and Mississippi.
[00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:13.044]  We've got alligators here in Texas.
[00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:20.606]  People killed them 50, 60, 70, 100 years ago because they were killing people's kids, dogs, and wives and killing men occasionally.
[00:02:20.626 --> 00:02:25.488]  They're not like the big 25-foot African crocodiles that will kill elephants.
[00:02:25.988 --> 00:02:30.330]  But they're a big problem and now every few months I see a report of them killing somebody.
[00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.311]  But they will arrest you if you go out and blast one of these bad boys.
[00:02:35.057 --> 00:02:37.680]  And they have special little permits to hunt them now.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.125]  For a while it was banned, claiming they were endangered, which is total baloney.
[00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:44.688]  There's alligators all over the place, my friends.
[00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:45.409]  There's alligators.
[00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:47.342]  In Southeast Texas.
[00:02:47.462 --> 00:02:48.022]  I've seen them.
[00:02:48.563 --> 00:02:49.503]  In Caddo Lake.
[00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:53.786]  Alligator likely stalked jogger on land before attack.
[00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:58.949]  An alligator that killed a woman jogger in Broward County Florida likely stalked her on land before the attack.
[00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.550]  According to local 6 News.
[00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:07.375]  I'm going to get into this and all the wildcats, the mountain lions, the pumas, whatever you want to call them, killing children and women.
[00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:10.797]  Right here in Texas, California.
[00:03:10.817 --> 00:03:11.958]  It's happening all over the place.
[00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:13.739]  Don't you dare shoot one though!
[00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:16.239]  They're breeding like cockroaches.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.181]  I've seen them all over the place.
[00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.402]  I've seen them in East Texas.
[00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:23.327]  I've been deer hunting and haven't seen one sneaking through the bushes looking at me.
[00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:26.350]  I have ran off where I could blast it.
[00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:28.232]  I've seen them all over the place.
[00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:29.754]  I've seen them in Northern California.
[00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:32.337]  So we'll get a little bit into that.
[00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.130]  Also, 72 and Congress joined battle against wiretaps.
[00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.812]  And I want to go back over some of the quotes of Bush and others, promising they're not tapping us, promising that they have to have warrants.
[00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:46.713]  And then now, of course, they claim they don't need no stinking warrants.
[00:03:47.673 --> 00:03:54.515]  And then there's this deceptive AP headline, Nation Split on NSA Records Collection.
[00:03:56.031 --> 00:04:08.117]  And they claim, oh the nation's split, and you look at the poll, 70 plus percent are against this, a warrantless wiretapping, even when the media poses it as, aren't you for wiretapping if it keeps you safe from Al-Qaeda?
[00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:16.582]  So we'll get into that, and meanwhile Bush lawyers are saying Americans have consented to have phone records seized.
[00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:19.103]  We've talked a lot about this in the past, we'll get into that.
[00:04:19.803 --> 00:04:24.806]  And Paul Watson's written an excellent article for PrisonPlanet.com, Big Brother wants listening
[00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.492]  In a long time ago.
[00:04:27.552 --> 00:04:31.098]  Again, Big Brother was listening in a long time ago.
[00:04:31.118 --> 00:04:33.541]  There's nothing new about this.
[00:04:35.177 --> 00:04:38.180]  And there's some new articles here as well on Iran.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.042]  Some new articles dealing with the Minutemen and the border.
[00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:46.446]  It's all coming up today and two extremely interesting guests.
[00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:51.310]  I'm really looking forward to these interviews that we're going to be having coming up.
[00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.696]  Websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com.
[00:04:58.736 --> 00:04:59.517]  Check them out today.
[00:05:08.405 --> 00:05:11.247]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:13.088]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:18.091]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:25.176]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:27.477]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:30.517]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:35.259]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.880]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.521]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy.
[00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:47.365]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:50.048]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:53.752]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:54.172]  1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:58.177 --> 00:05:59.618]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253...
[00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:08.814]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:06:08.954 --> 00:06:21.883]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:23.845]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:27.488]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:31.551]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:36.775]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:38.756]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:06:39.017 --> 00:06:43.000]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotion.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.061]  Zango is what you are looking for.
[00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:47.763]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit Mango C Market
[00:06:51.306 --> 00:06:51.868]  I think so.
[00:07:03.243 --> 00:07:05.805]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:08.126]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:18.512]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.154]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:08:02.791 --> 00:08:08.833]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:12.474]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:15.235]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.416]  Big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:19.397]  We always have a big finish on Fridays.
[00:08:19.797 --> 00:08:21.538]  Two great guests I'll tell you about a little bit later.
[00:08:21.558 --> 00:08:26.899]  We have the father of remote viewing joining us and unconventional weapons coming up in the third hour.
[00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.520]  His wife is a medical doctor.
[00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:41.229]  And wants to expose the Codex Alimentarius going after natural remedies and even over-the-counter vitamin C. They'll both be joining us from Canada coming up in the second and third hours today.
[00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:43.611]  We'll have open phones as well.
[00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:46.833]  Gold hit $717 yesterday from just $700 two days ago.
[00:08:55.095 --> 00:08:58.136]  And it's meteoric rise is continuing unabated.
[00:08:58.196 --> 00:09:03.319]  It's up a few cents from what it was yesterday, and looks like it's going to continue to climb.
[00:09:03.719 --> 00:09:18.565]  The dollar, of course, has been devalued by now 46%, and that's the main reason that the gold has climbed, the main reason that oil prices per barrel of crude oil has climbed, and then you add on top of that the oil company's own documents.
[00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:28.550]  That they bought up over 200 refineries from 1995 to 2001 and shut them down, every private refinery in this country, to create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.871]  That just adds to the pain.
[00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:33.593]  Then you put another layer of increased gas taxes on that.
[00:09:33.993 --> 00:09:35.534]  It is a hellish recipe.
[00:09:35.954 --> 00:09:39.336]  In Texas, the official state documents, and we're the bellwether for the rest of the country,
[00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:51.265]  Texas Department of Transportation is integrated with the Federal Department of Transportation and they admit that Texas will have over three dollars a gallon of taxes added within the next two years.
[00:09:51.305 --> 00:09:54.968]  They're moving ahead with transponders for all cars in the inspection stickers.
[00:09:54.988 --> 00:09:56.509]  We shot down the bill last year.
[00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:03.455]  The legislature, it's being, by two votes by the way, it's being brought up again in the special session that's kicking off this week, excuse me, next week.
[00:10:04.426 --> 00:10:06.468]  And it's going to be here, and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:10:06.788 --> 00:10:07.348]  I know I will.
[00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:09.870]  I'll worship the world government with you, and we'll all be raped by them.
[00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.011]  Three dollars a gallon.
[00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:15.014]  It'll spread nationwide from Oregon to California and New York on the verge of implementing as well.
[00:10:15.675 --> 00:10:17.176]  And just again, I hope you enjoy it.
[00:10:17.456 --> 00:10:17.816]  Alrighty.
[00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:21.339]  We'll be getting into more of that later as well.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.462]  But before I go any further...
[00:10:26.545 --> 00:10:29.566]  Here, let's just go ahead and get into the alligator killing the lady.
[00:10:29.766 --> 00:10:35.028]  And normally I would see this as a diversion story, but I just can't help myself.
[00:10:35.848 --> 00:10:44.091]  Every few months I see a report out of the Dakotas or out of Nebraska, normally out of Northern or even Central California.
[00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:47.993]  And in Texas, there haven't been any deaths lately in Texas.
[00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:55.870]  They just maul people, and in famous cases fathers or mothers physically pull the lions off of their family.
[00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:04.276]  They call them mountain lions, they call them wildcats, they call them puma, and there's different varieties of them, subspecies, but they can all interbreed.
[00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:11.538]  You don't see a lot of attacks in Florida because it's a smaller swamp cougar, or puma, and there's many names, different Indian names.
[00:11:11.978 --> 00:11:17.919]  For them, the European settlers call them wildcats or mountain lions.
[00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:26.901]  The biggest are in northern California, Oregon, and Washington State, and in deep southwest Texas in Big Bend.
[00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:31.162]  And they tell you, don't let your children stray off very far from you when you're in Big Bend.
[00:11:31.722 --> 00:11:57.252]  I have seen wildcats in Big Bend, I've seen them in East Texas, I've seen them all over and believe me, you're walking to your deer stand, back when I had time to do such things, at 5 o'clock in the morning and as soon as it starts getting light and you see one of these big cats, before you can get your sights on them, they're gone, it'll send a big chill up your spine, especially when you hear them put out one of their calls right as it's getting light.
[00:11:58.115 --> 00:12:04.278]  And see a bunch of deer go running out of the woods, across the pipeline to safety.
[00:12:05.498 --> 00:12:15.602]  And my point is, is that I don't think that we should kill all the wolves, or kill all the mountain lions, or kill all the grizzlies, or kill all the moose.
[00:12:16.323 --> 00:12:26.327]  But we should kill some of them, so they get a good fear, a good natural fear of the alpha predator on Terra, on planet Earth, on this dirt.
[00:12:27.463 --> 00:12:43.084]  And all over the world, predator species are now attacking humans because they have enacted environmental rules and sanctuary rules all over the planet, heavily restricting or outright banning the hunting of predator species.
[00:12:44.119 --> 00:12:44.859]  And it's a problem.
[00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:51.600]  We now have wolves that wouldn't dare get near human settlements attacking and killing sheep and cows all over Texas.
[00:12:52.581 --> 00:12:57.061]  We have the timber wolf down here now that was thought to be extinct in this area just a few years ago.
[00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:58.382]  We have the Mexican red wolf.
[00:12:58.742 --> 00:13:02.322]  It's really a hybrid between the coyote and a timber wolf.
[00:13:03.183 --> 00:13:06.503]  And we have gray wolves, timber wolves all over the place.
[00:13:06.543 --> 00:13:10.724]  They're attacking livestock all over Minnesota and the Dakotas and even into Michigan.
[00:13:11.952 --> 00:13:15.033]  We have grizzly bears killing and eating people on a routine basis.
[00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:21.814]  We even have black bears, normally more friendly and docile, and gregarious attacking humans in human settlements.
[00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:25.695]  We have polar bears attacking and killing humans at record levels.
[00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:28.696]  We have wolves now attacking humans.
[00:13:28.736 --> 00:13:34.638]  They usually go after people who are around 100 pounds or lighter, small women, or children.
[00:13:35.198 --> 00:13:39.959]  They're coming into major neighborhoods in central and northern California and killing children.
[00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:44.241]  Every few months I see these reports, and you'd think it'd be a big sensational thing.
[00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:47.242]  You'd think the media would want to pick up on this, but they stay real quiet about it.
[00:13:47.582 --> 00:13:51.064]  We've got them reintroducing Puma all over the country.
[00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.024]  We have elk attacking people.
[00:13:53.104 --> 00:13:56.306]  Those that didn't know it, elk and moose are very dangerous.
[00:13:56.886 --> 00:14:01.088]  And these things need to have the fear of God put back in them, and it's out of control.
[00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:04.314]  And every few months I hear about an alligator attack.
[00:14:04.774 --> 00:14:07.075]  Every week I hear about them eating even your German Shepherd.
[00:14:07.095 --> 00:14:10.495]  I mean, you've got something like a Boston Terrier or a Chihuahua.
[00:14:10.575 --> 00:14:11.376]  It's over, folks.
[00:14:11.776 --> 00:14:12.236]  It's dinner.
[00:14:12.876 --> 00:14:24.058]  And these people, these domesticated people in Florida, in these big city settlements, call the police and the police come and simply helicopter out or load the alligators, sometimes 15, 20 feet long.
[00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:25.818]  Well, that's not true.
[00:14:25.918 --> 00:14:27.518]  I think they're up to 18 here.
[00:14:27.538 --> 00:14:30.479]  They have 25, even 27 foot crocodiles in Africa.
[00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:38.463]  But these alligators, who aren't as aggressive and are quite stupid compared to crocodiles, are killing people, are attacking.
[00:14:38.983 --> 00:14:45.827]  And if I lived in Florida, or if I lived in Southeast Texas, and an alligator came up in my yard, I'm going to blow its head off.
[00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:47.589]  It's just going to happen.
[00:14:48.229 --> 00:14:53.453]  Just like if I see a copperhead in my backyard, I'm going to go chop its head off with a hoe or a machete.
[00:14:54.466 --> 00:14:55.147]  It's going to happen.
[00:14:55.267 --> 00:14:56.749]  I'm not going to leave them slithering around.
[00:14:57.109 --> 00:14:59.571]  Some areas, they claim that rattlesnakes are endangered.
[00:14:59.611 --> 00:15:02.114]  And by the way, they have new standards for this.
[00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:09.541]  In the past, a real endangered or threatened species designation meant that worldwide its numbers have declined to a certain level.
[00:15:09.882 --> 00:15:13.445]  Now they have this regionalization where in some, what was the case a few years ago?
[00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:15.127]  I interviewed the guy with the big auto.
[00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:28.593]  Repair Shop and he had this supposedly rare type of timber rattler coming into his office and it had bitten someone so he put in a snake fence around the office and what happened?
[00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:29.974]  They came and arrested him.
[00:15:29.994 --> 00:15:30.374]  Remember that?
[00:15:30.394 --> 00:15:31.254]  That had to be about 8 years ago.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.201]  I don't think so.
[00:15:49.396 --> 00:15:51.338]  And of course there's a lot of fraud involved in that.
[00:15:51.358 --> 00:15:59.865]  They'll just send out a few college kids, you know, doing field samples and in three months in the woods they only see three rattlers.
[00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:05.050]  They then have formulas and they claim there's only a hundred rattlers and really there's thousands of rattlers.
[00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.312]  These people just aren't out there running into them.
[00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:10.699]  And it's the same for everything else.
[00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:12.260]  Golden-cheeked warbler birds.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.644]  They're all over Mexico, but there's only a small area of central Texas they roost in.
[00:16:16.925 --> 00:16:22.750]  The bird isn't even threatened globally here in southern North America, but it doesn't matter.
[00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.955]  They don't let people build over hundreds of thousands of acres in central Texas because of the golden-cheeked warbler.
[00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:28.916]  It's a cute little bird.
[00:16:28.956 --> 00:16:29.656]  I like birds.
[00:16:29.756 --> 00:16:31.818]  In my off time, I read about them.
[00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:32.259]  I like them.
[00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:35.180]  Alligator likely stopped jogger on land before attack.
[00:16:53.985 --> 00:17:07.593]  And all over major cities of Florida, where they're near swamps, these things are all over the place, running down the streets, literally, killing people, attacking animals, grabbing kids, normally they get away, the alligator grabs them and they fight it off.
[00:17:08.173 --> 00:17:09.734]  Not in this case, it must be a big'un.
[00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:19.254]  An alligator that killed a woman, Jogger, in Broward County, Florida, likely stopped her on land before the attack, according to a local 6 News report today.
[00:17:19.754 --> 00:17:32.306]  A Broward County medical examiner said the alligator attacked Yavi Saraz Jimenez, 28, of Davie on land and then dragged her dismembered body into a nearby lake.
[00:17:32.936 --> 00:17:41.800]  They like to drag the carcass and then they like rotten meats and when they eat a mammal and then they stick you underneath some logs and come back a week later and enjoy you.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:51.704]  It is my professional opinion that the alligator attacked the woman while she was on land said Dr. Jose Prepper, Broward County's medical examiner.
[00:17:51.824 --> 00:17:58.327]  She died in traumatic injury sustained by an alligator attack by a mixture of blood loss and shock in my opinion.
[00:17:59.808 --> 00:18:00.728]  She probably gave up.
[00:18:01.229 --> 00:18:01.729]  And it says
[00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:11.307]  Purple ruled out drowning because little water was found in her stomach and lungs according to a story on Miami Herald's website today.
[00:18:12.288 --> 00:18:19.054]  Earlier, Officer Jorge Pino, spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said the department had witnessed two
[00:18:20.623 --> 00:18:29.689]  Had witnesses who had seen the woman matching her description, dangling her feet over the water's edge, but no one saw an attack, Pino said.
[00:18:30.189 --> 00:18:36.993]  Trappers will try to catch and kill the animal, believed to be eight to ten feet long, and the contents of its stomach will be examined, Pino said.
[00:18:37.434 --> 00:18:42.597]  Pepper said the alligator appeared to have crawled onto the land and killed her and dragged her body into the water.
[00:18:43.077 --> 00:18:45.479]  He said alligators generally pull their prey into the water,
[00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:49.861]  Now, when they are hungry, they can be very, very aggressive and attack for food purposes.
[00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:50.462]  Oh, really?
[00:18:50.802 --> 00:18:51.462]  It's for food?
[00:18:52.223 --> 00:18:58.947]  There have been 25 fatal alligator attacks in Florida in the last 50 years, according to Wildlife Commission, and it goes on.
[00:18:59.807 --> 00:19:03.450]  Alright, yeah, most of them have been in modern days, not back in the 40's.
[00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.112]  They need to call hunters in.
[00:19:07.172 --> 00:19:08.753]  They need to have a big open hunt.
[00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:15.681]  All over Florida, and hunters will deal with these things real quick, and they will retreat to the bayous.
[00:19:15.701 --> 00:19:17.022]  They will retreat to the swamps.
[00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:20.825]  They will retreat to the inaccessible areas.
[00:19:21.305 --> 00:19:25.569]  It's time to kill the mountain lions, and it's time to kill the alligators.
[00:19:26.469 --> 00:19:28.151]  The things are all over the place.
[00:19:28.211 --> 00:19:29.231]  It's ridiculous!
[00:19:30.272 --> 00:19:36.037]  Coast to coast they're reporting mountain lions, wolves, coyotes, killing our pets and our children.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.781]  Grizzly bears are coming into the cities.
[00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:39.861]  Kill them!
[00:19:41.542 --> 00:19:42.662]  This is what we do.
[00:19:42.762 --> 00:19:44.003]  We're the alpha predator.
[00:19:44.403 --> 00:19:45.943]  Let's start acting like it again.
[00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:50.485]  Normally when these things eat pets or menace people, they just fly them off.
[00:19:50.545 --> 00:19:51.486]  They need to kill them!
[00:19:52.986 --> 00:19:57.428]  That'll get the message through to these animals that we're on top of the food chain.
[00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:05.123]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:05.483 --> 00:20:08.345]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:08.585 --> 00:20:14.767]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:20:57.971 --> 00:20:58.631]  One and the same.
[00:20:58.731 --> 00:21:07.593]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30 month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.692]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:26.793]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.893 --> 00:21:29.874]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:32.636]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.996 --> 00:21:36.578]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:40.740]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.761]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:11.115]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:22:11.155 --> 00:22:11.896]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:12.685 --> 00:22:16.966]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in a 9-0 decision of the U.S.
[00:22:17.006 --> 00:22:20.626]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:26.868]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[00:23:02.465 --> 00:23:04.487]  What has been deemed the healthiest oil on the earth?
[00:23:05.057 --> 00:23:06.198]  Virgin Coconut Oil.
[00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:08.901]  What did Woman's Day Magazine call the Miracle Oil?
[00:23:09.422 --> 00:23:10.483]  Virgin Coconut Oil.
[00:23:10.944 --> 00:23:16.309]  Why have people reported increased energy, reduction in food craving, and an easier time losing weight?
[00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.091]  Virgin Coconut Oil.
[00:23:18.392 --> 00:23:19.373]  The answer is clear.
[00:23:19.713 --> 00:23:22.536]  It's time to switch to Virgin Coconut Oil by Nourishing Planet.
[00:23:22.817 --> 00:23:24.038]  Made from organic coconuts,
[00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:28.221]  Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil is produced in the pristine Fiji Islands.
[00:23:28.682 --> 00:23:38.069]  Using coconuts within hours of opening, Nourishing Planet Virgin Coconut Oil retains more of the nutrition, including the tocotrienols, which are powerful vitamin E antioxidants.
[00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:43.333]  The minimally processed coconuts allow for delightful taste and the aroma of fresh coconuts.

[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:14.724]  Just on the predator subject, in closing, remember Dr. Pianka from EOTA who says 90% of us need to die, the dying need to start now?
[00:24:15.305 --> 00:24:18.766]  These are the people that are running our wildlife management programs.
[00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:20.087]  This is the mindset.
[00:24:20.723 --> 00:24:25.864]  And it's almost like a snickering joke when kids, even in Southern California, right outside L.A.
[00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:26.804]  every year, get eaten.
[00:24:26.824 --> 00:24:35.266]  And as Kevin put it during the break, they just pop the top of the skull off like it's, you know, taking the top off a can of Pringles.
[00:24:36.226 --> 00:24:38.047]  And we're dying.
[00:24:38.107 --> 00:24:39.207]  People are being killed.
[00:24:39.907 --> 00:24:41.508]  And it needs to stop, okay?
[00:24:42.408 --> 00:24:44.708]  This doesn't happen when these things are hunted.
[00:24:45.668 --> 00:24:46.789]  Just to a controlled level.
[00:24:46.829 --> 00:24:47.989]  I don't want to kill all of them.
[00:24:48.536 --> 00:24:50.437]  It's just that we come first, okay?
[00:24:50.837 --> 00:24:51.897]  Humans come first.
[00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:59.420]  And a lot of these liberals, boy, they really get upset when their kids get killed and suddenly they don't love the mountain lions anymore or the alligators.
[00:25:00.401 --> 00:25:03.182]  Alright, where to start here?
[00:25:03.242 --> 00:25:04.823]  There is so much news.
[00:25:06.643 --> 00:25:10.645]  USA Today sent shockwaves across the country announcing
[00:25:11.377 --> 00:25:22.187]  That the NSA is recording all telephone conversation records and creating maps of who talks to who and then who they talk to to get a picture of how our communities operate.
[00:25:22.567 --> 00:25:26.111]  And then they're spying on land rights groups, they're spying on
[00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:27.211]  Peace groups.
[00:25:27.251 --> 00:25:28.532]  They're spying on everybody.
[00:25:28.572 --> 00:25:29.432]  This is old news.
[00:25:29.472 --> 00:25:31.553]  It's been declassified for a long time.
[00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:36.735]  That's why it's such a joke when Bush gets up months ago and says, we're not spying on you without warrants.
[00:25:36.815 --> 00:25:39.256]  Oh, it's just overseas calls to the U.S.
[00:25:39.316 --> 00:25:40.596]  It's just Al-C-I-A-da.
[00:25:40.657 --> 00:25:41.777]  Excuse me, I mean Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.355]  Then he gets caught domestically spying, we already knew that, and he spins it and says, I'm above the law, I'm allowed to.
[00:25:48.515 --> 00:25:54.261]  Look, it was going on under Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George Bush Sr., current Bush administration.
[00:25:55.042 --> 00:25:56.383]  This has been going on forever.
[00:25:56.804 --> 00:25:59.006]  It has nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:02.249]  It has nothing to do with stopping terrorism.
[00:26:02.956 --> 00:26:05.800]  It's all about getting control of this population.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.788]  In fact, they put up big microphones all over downtown Austin with the cameras last week.
[00:26:10.808 --> 00:26:12.530]  We already had a lot of microphones put up.
[00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:17.758]  They started in 98, but now huge, telescopic shotgun mics are going up everywhere.
[00:26:18.348 --> 00:26:20.289]  They can listen to you at hundreds of yards away!
[00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:21.870]  I mean, it's a joke!
[00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.010]  A total control grid!
[00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:25.432]  But not cameras and microphones on our borders!
[00:26:25.652 --> 00:26:26.252]  Oh, no!
[00:26:26.692 --> 00:26:36.137]  And we've got to call the Minutemen vigilantes, and we've got to report all their movements, the federal government does, to the Mexican troops, and it's disgusting!
[00:26:37.498 --> 00:26:43.421]  Meanwhile, White House lawyers are coming out, I have this here in front of me out of the Associated Press, and saying,
[00:26:45.535 --> 00:26:52.265]  When you signed your phone company agreement for service, you didn't read the fine print.
[00:26:52.305 --> 00:26:53.447]  Well, we've talked about this on air.
[00:26:53.527 --> 00:27:01.018]  It does indeed say they can shell your data, do whatever they want with it, give it to whoever they want, and that's to get around this being illegal.
[00:27:01.818 --> 00:27:06.023]  But it's still illegal for Bush to use that data for law enforcement purposes.
[00:27:06.484 --> 00:27:08.005]  And they're saying, oh, you signed the agreement.
[00:27:08.045 --> 00:27:09.847]  It's like the Know Your Customer legislation.
[00:27:10.248 --> 00:27:10.929]  We beat that in 2000.
[00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:13.392]  They just brought it back in 2001.
[00:27:14.072 --> 00:27:19.619]  And now when you go in and sign a bank account record, you say the IRS can take all your money without judge, jury, or charges?
[00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:21.161]  Then you waive your rights.
[00:27:21.741 --> 00:27:23.221]  But then you've got to have a bank account to live.
[00:27:23.261 --> 00:27:25.442]  See, they get you to waive them with the government.
[00:27:25.722 --> 00:27:27.443]  You waive your rights to be spied on.
[00:27:27.483 --> 00:27:31.924]  You waive your rights for suspicious transaction reports to be filled out on you.
[00:27:32.284 --> 00:27:37.465]  You waive your rights to allow them to take your safety deposit box.
[00:27:37.505 --> 00:27:39.006]  You waive your rights for everything.
[00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:41.806]  When you get a driver's license, you waive your rights.
[00:27:42.747 --> 00:27:42.967]  Okay?
[00:27:42.987 --> 00:27:44.227]  And then they call it a privilege.
[00:27:44.307 --> 00:27:48.968]  No, they get you through contract fraud to waive your rights.
[00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.789]  And here it is.
[00:27:51.744 --> 00:27:53.927]  in the mainstream media.
[00:27:54.988 --> 00:27:59.493]  Government lawyers say Americans consented to have phone records seized.
[00:28:00.228 --> 00:28:09.754]  Friday's Washington Post reveals the Bush Administration's legal response to revelations that tens of millions of Americans' personal phone records have been acquired by the National Security Agency.
[00:28:10.234 --> 00:28:11.535]  Excerpts from the Post follow.
[00:28:11.615 --> 00:28:12.435]  Full article here.
[00:28:13.096 --> 00:28:21.020]  One government lawyer who has participated in negotiations with telecommunications providers to the Bush Administration has argued that a company can turn over its entire database.
[00:28:21.521 --> 00:28:24.362]  In 96, they started putting the NSA offices in, folks.
[00:28:24.662 --> 00:28:25.343]  So this is spin.
[00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:30.914]  In its entire database of customer records and even the stored content of calls and emails.
[00:28:31.434 --> 00:28:48.608]  Because customers have consented to that when they establish accounts, the fine print of many telephone and internet service contracts includes catch-all provisions, the lawyer said, authorizing the company to disclose such records to protect public safety or national security or in compliance with a lawful government request.
[00:28:49.188 --> 00:28:53.211]  It is within their terms of service because you have consented to that, the lawyer said.
[00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:58.014]  If the company also consents, and they do it voluntarily, the U.S.
[00:28:58.054 --> 00:28:59.175]  government can accept it.
[00:29:00.845 --> 00:29:21.421]  They signed an agreement with federal regulators to take six billion dollars, and it went over three billion, they were paid over nine billion, to put these in, and in 96 the regulations said that by October 1st, 2001, every phone call would be tracked, traced, in some cases recorded, but its entire destination in history stored forever.
[00:29:21.441 --> 00:29:23.903]  We're going to come back.
[00:29:23.923 --> 00:29:24.803]  I don't want to get sped up here.
[00:29:24.823 --> 00:29:26.285]  I want to cover all this in detail.
[00:29:27.005 --> 00:29:28.927]  How many years did I tell you this?
[00:29:29.107 --> 00:29:30.568]  It was public!
[00:29:31.966 --> 00:29:33.967]  Oh, Alex Jones claims they listen to everything.
[00:29:34.047 --> 00:29:35.648]  Alex Jones claims they record everything.
[00:29:36.089 --> 00:29:38.350]  But listen, all this is coming out for a reason.
[00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.751]  They're doing this by design.
[00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:42.492]  We'll break down why on the other side.
[00:29:43.173 --> 00:29:44.974]  Get into a bunch of other news on the NSA.
[00:29:45.014 --> 00:29:46.094]  This thing's breaking big.
[00:29:46.114 --> 00:29:49.536]  A lot of new facets are being revealed and surfacing.
[00:29:52.118 --> 00:29:53.059]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.499 --> 00:29:55.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.722]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.838 --> 00:30:08.163]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.523 --> 00:30:13.207]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:13.527 --> 00:30:21.193]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.473 --> 00:30:28.319]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:29.920]  There are no side effects!
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.884]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:34.184 --> 00:30:41.251]  BioSolutions has over 550 programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:41.511 --> 00:30:44.514]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:44.934 --> 00:30:47.337]  Ask about our Spring Special now in progress.
[00:30:47.677 --> 00:30:51.001]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free at 866-885-6625.
[00:30:51.061 --> 00:30:51.402]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:51.442 --> 00:30:52.283]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:08.248]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:14.550]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:23.272]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.512 --> 00:31:30.534]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.854 --> 00:31:35.677]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.897 --> 00:31:41.301]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.641 --> 00:31:44.703]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:45.064 --> 00:31:53.049]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.069 --> 00:31:53.629]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[00:32:13.242 --> 00:32:26.611]  For example, did you know that LIV52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:32:26.931 --> 00:32:30.654]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:32:31.081 --> 00:32:39.225]  Including those for cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, cirrhosis, and hepatitis, among others, is extremely well documented.

[00:32:52.811 --> 00:32:53.051]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:33:12.558 --> 00:33:15.740]  Welcome back my friends, Kathy, Eric, Taylor, Zane, many other callers.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:25.464]  Your calls are coming up after I can cover some of the new info on the NSA scandal breaking and the amazing spin and propaganda and conditioning we're witnessing.
[00:33:26.124 --> 00:33:30.266]  Tell you really my take on what's behind all this, at least what's behind a lot of it.
[00:33:31.181 --> 00:33:41.144]  Because they take anything bad that happens to them, anything bad that exposes them as criminals, and they just basically spin it to their own betterment, to their own advancement.
[00:33:42.525 --> 00:33:52.408]  Before we do that, I've got a big 9-11 conference coming up June 24th and June 25th in Los Angeles, California at the Sheraton downtown.
[00:33:53.536 --> 00:33:56.238]  And I suggest you get your tickets now and get your rooms there now.
[00:33:56.318 --> 00:34:00.522]  If not, there are literally, it's got to be hundreds of motels and hotels right in that area.
[00:34:00.562 --> 00:34:03.184]  I mean, it's ridiculous the choices there are.
[00:34:04.045 --> 00:34:09.169]  And we're going to have Dr. Stephen Jones, the physics professor, getting into the controlled demolition of the towers.
[00:34:09.209 --> 00:34:15.193]  We're going to have Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars program, exposing how 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:34:15.494 --> 00:34:16.975]  Looks like Ray McGovern may be coming.
[00:34:17.015 --> 00:34:18.116]  That's tentative right now.
[00:34:19.585 --> 00:34:26.928]  And we've also got Dylan Avery with Loose Change 2nd Edition with some special little tidbits he's going to be airing there.
[00:34:26.948 --> 00:34:29.949]  And on top of that, we're going to have Webster Tarpley.
[00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:35.411]  We're going to have Professor Jim Fetzer, the head of the 9-11 Scholars for Truth.
[00:34:35.832 --> 00:34:40.734]  Myself, I'll be screening my new film, which we are officially going to call Terror Storm.
[00:34:40.754 --> 00:34:43.875]  I think that's the best name, a storm of terror.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.580]  That is what we're witnessing.
[00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:46.441]  We'll screen that.
[00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:48.882]  And there'll be some surprise guests.
[00:34:48.902 --> 00:34:56.585]  We're not going to announce until you're there, but some very interesting surprise guests that, believe me, you don't want to miss.
[00:34:56.806 --> 00:35:06.050]  And it's very expensive doing this in LA, but normally a conference that's two days, ten hours a day, would be, you know, $200.
[00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.231]  It's $75 per ticket.
[00:35:08.251 --> 00:35:09.931]  If you get multiple tickets, it drops down to $34.
[00:35:11.412 --> 00:35:13.414]  A ticket to encourage more people to come.
[00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:17.137]  Go to InfoWars.com and get the tickets online.
[00:35:17.417 --> 00:35:19.618]  We'll send you an e-ticket with your ticket number and everything.
[00:35:20.099 --> 00:35:23.822]  Or you can call toll free and then order the tickets and they can answer your questions.
[00:35:24.162 --> 00:35:26.904]  And we'll mail you out a physical ticket with your ticket number.
[00:35:27.304 --> 00:35:30.527]  And then everybody gets a little wristband, a colored wristband, and you don't have to worry.
[00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:34.450]  You only check in one time there on Saturday morning.
[00:35:35.182 --> 00:35:46.487]  You can read the itinerary, the speakers, everything that's happening by linking through via InfoWars.com and get tickets via the secure online big mainstream ticket service Tix.com that we're using.
[00:35:47.087 --> 00:35:48.128]  So you can call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:48.148 --> 00:35:48.488]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:48.508 --> 00:35:51.329]  Or you can simply go to InfoWars.com and get your tickets today.
[00:35:59.893 --> 00:36:05.757]  And we have sold more than 20% of the tickets, only now what, six or seven days into offering these.
[00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:09.119]  There's 40 days left until the conference.
[00:36:09.319 --> 00:36:14.822]  I would imagine that the thousand tickets that are available will be gone before it opens.
[00:36:14.882 --> 00:36:18.485]  So I would secure yours now, make a little trip out of it.
[00:36:18.525 --> 00:36:23.408]  It's during vacation time anyways, and then maybe go see the sites and things on Monday and Tuesday after the
[00:36:24.208 --> 00:36:27.350]  conference and then go back to your hacienda, wherever that may be.
[00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:33.814]  But whether it's Salt Lake City, or whether you live in Portland, Oregon, or LA, or Austin, Texas, people from all over the country are saying they're going.
[00:36:33.874 --> 00:36:36.716]  It's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, believe me.
[00:36:37.156 --> 00:36:39.518]  So again, that is coming up June 24th and 25th.
[00:36:39.798 --> 00:36:40.818]  We hope to see you there.
[00:36:40.939 --> 00:36:43.680]  All the details are at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:44.441 --> 00:36:48.103]  But again, if you don't have a computer, you can call and get your tickets and we will mail them to you.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:51.045]  But we're going to cut off the tickets that you can buy
[00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:58.017]  Well, the more I think about it, for people that order, I guess, in the last two weeks or so, we'll probably just have it where your physical ticket is there.
[00:36:58.517 --> 00:37:00.999]  Then you'll have to check in with us once you get there, but that'll be okay.
[00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:04.961]  We'll probably keep selling tickets over the toll-free number right up until a few days before.
[00:37:05.542 --> 00:37:07.243]  So, again, InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:11.832 --> 00:37:14.755]  Now here in just a few minutes I'm going to get into all the details of the NSA.
[00:37:14.875 --> 00:37:16.696]  Very, very important situation.
[00:37:16.777 --> 00:37:18.478]  It's a total violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:37:18.538 --> 00:37:19.299]  Totally criminal.
[00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:22.041]  And how they're trying to spin it and sell it to the American people.
[00:37:23.082 --> 00:37:24.784]  Then we'll get to the loaded phone lines here.
[00:37:25.384 --> 00:37:26.585]  But gold hit.
[00:37:26.866 --> 00:37:29.188]  I normally have Ted Anderson on every three or four months.
[00:37:30.456 --> 00:37:41.962]  I'm going to have him on more and more here for the next few weeks because, I mean, I bought gold when it was $230, when it was $300, when it was $400, when it was $440 a few months ago, when it was $500, when it was $640 a week ago.
[00:37:41.982 --> 00:37:43.463]  You know, a few coins here, a few coins there.
[00:37:44.143 --> 00:37:49.666]  The stock market itself is really at about $6,500 because the dollar has almost been devalued by half.
[00:37:50.046 --> 00:37:57.350]  So, if you do the real numbers, we've had Chief Economist for Reagan and Bush on talking about this, that the stock market's really at about $6,500, not $11,600 as you've been hearing.
[00:38:01.403 --> 00:38:04.284]  It's so important to understand that.
[00:38:04.364 --> 00:38:05.325]  But look at gold.
[00:38:05.405 --> 00:38:06.985]  I mean, it's keeping its value.
[00:38:07.065 --> 00:38:07.745]  It's growing.
[00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:15.909]  It's $717 and going up, at least when I checked an hour ago, so join us just for two or three minutes, is Ted Anderson.
[00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:21.551]  Ted, we keep telling people that fiat currency can be devalued down to nothing.
[00:38:22.231 --> 00:38:23.111]  That is happening.
[00:38:23.171 --> 00:38:24.192]  I'm just horrified.
[00:38:24.852 --> 00:38:29.694]  I'm not even really pleased, but at least I invested in gold, so I'm sitting pretty.
[00:38:31.054 --> 00:38:34.595]  I think people should continue to buy gold now before it even goes up more, Ted.
[00:38:34.615 --> 00:38:39.837]  I mean, even mainstream analysts in the Wall Street Journal are saying it could go over $1,200 right now.
[00:38:40.037 --> 00:38:41.097]  Ted, what do you see happening?
[00:38:41.237 --> 00:38:47.139]  Well, you know, like I said just a couple days ago, Alex, I believe that gold could hit $2,400 an ounce.
[00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:50.720]  There's a lot of analysts that look at it from that perspective as well.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:56.622]  When you consider and you factor in the inflationary effect that has happened since the last peak in the marketplace, which was 1980,
[00:38:57.958 --> 00:39:00.059]  And we had approximately $800 gold.
[00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:05.020]  You could easily say that the money supply was increased by at least three times since then.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.301]  It's been 20-some years.
[00:39:06.321 --> 00:39:11.342]  Ted, Alan Greenspan admitted they doubled the money supply in the last six years, so it's got to be more than three times.
[00:39:11.522 --> 00:39:12.042]  Oh, yeah.
[00:39:12.322 --> 00:39:15.443]  And then, of course, that makes $2,400 a very conservative figure.
[00:39:15.824 --> 00:39:21.305]  But at this particular time, gold has been at $719 now.
[00:39:21.365 --> 00:39:23.646]  It's up another couple of bucks since the last time you looked.
[00:39:24.181 --> 00:39:24.701]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:39:42.153 --> 00:39:44.635]  The United States has not stopped deficit spending.
[00:39:44.675 --> 00:39:48.618]  As a matter of fact, we're deficit spending more now than we have in any other administration.
[00:39:49.298 --> 00:39:55.583]  And as long as we're willing to deficit spend, the Federal Reserve Bank is going to continue to print money in order to finance that.
[00:39:55.603 --> 00:39:59.765]  And foreign countries worldwide are dumping the dollar in a controlled descent right now.
[00:40:00.086 --> 00:40:01.747]  Yeah, it is.
[00:40:01.787 --> 00:40:03.128]  They're getting out of the U.S.
[00:40:03.168 --> 00:40:03.448]  dollar.
[00:40:03.488 --> 00:40:04.889]  They're getting into the precious metals.
[00:40:04.929 --> 00:40:09.572]  That's a testimonial to the fact that the globalists even think that the dollar is a bad investment.
[00:40:09.612 --> 00:40:11.574]  And at this time, I recommend fully
[00:40:11.954 --> 00:40:17.997]  That everybody have at least 20 to 30 percent of their portfolio tied into gold and silver, and that's conservative.
[00:40:18.437 --> 00:40:23.299]  You know, you take a look at the real estate bubble that's being created by the enormous debt that's out there.
[00:40:23.379 --> 00:40:25.420]  And they've already started lancing that.
[00:40:25.621 --> 00:40:25.841]  Yeah.
[00:40:25.921 --> 00:40:29.843]  So, you know, the only gold and silver is not, you know, there's no credit here.
[00:40:29.883 --> 00:40:34.825]  People buy gold and silver physically because of the fact that they, you know, that they want to hold on to it.
[00:40:34.885 --> 00:40:37.066]  Nobody has taken loans out to buy gold and silver.
[00:40:37.426 --> 00:40:40.948]  The futures market is, you know, shows it has a little bit of leverage in it, but it's
[00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:48.412]  It's not like the real estate bubble that we have created here, and it certainly is not like the stock market and all the margins that are going on over there.
[00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:52.273]  Well, Ted, I mean, I didn't dump gold when it went up from $240 to $500 to $600 to $700.
[00:40:52.393 --> 00:40:54.314]  I'm not dumping now.
[00:40:54.714 --> 00:40:58.275]  In fact, even at this price, as soon as I get some more capital, I'm going to move more into gold.
[00:40:58.675 --> 00:41:01.756]  I just made a purchase, what, two weeks ago and just received it on Monday.
[00:41:02.216 --> 00:41:04.057]  So all of this is going on.
[00:41:04.117 --> 00:41:05.277]  I've shopped gold, folks.
[00:41:06.058 --> 00:41:10.479]  Ted, a few days ago, offered, and that's the parent company of Genesis, Midas Resources,
[00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:15.001]  Ted was offering $10 pieces and I asked him, I said, can I say this on air?
[00:41:15.021 --> 00:41:15.842]  And Ted said, yeah, go ahead.
[00:41:16.222 --> 00:41:19.424]  Ted was making about $24 profit per coin.
[00:41:19.444 --> 00:41:22.026]  That's just enough to pay his brokers have enough money to operate.
[00:41:22.326 --> 00:41:23.426]  That's how competitive it is.
[00:41:23.707 --> 00:41:26.788]  Ted is on the low end of how much gold is going for.
[00:41:26.828 --> 00:41:31.051]  You can find it a lot more expensive or rarely you can find it a few dollars lower.
[00:41:31.971 --> 00:41:33.532]  It is just an insanely good deal.
[00:41:33.592 --> 00:41:34.673]  Ted, what are you offering today?
[00:41:34.693 --> 00:41:38.955]  You're almost out of those $10 pieces that you offered a few days ago.
[00:41:38.975 --> 00:41:50.440]  Well, actually, the $10 pieces just jumped up $4 since the offer on two days ago, and what I have right now are the $5 gold pieces, and they're currently right now at a price of $261 a coin.
[00:41:53.488 --> 00:41:56.852]  And $261 a coin is an excellent buy to be getting into the fives.
[00:41:56.972 --> 00:42:01.338]  Plus, in addition to this, Alex, like we've talked about on the tens, it's a very finite supply.
[00:42:01.358 --> 00:42:06.425]  There's not even enough of these to go around for the people who live in Austin, Texas, much less the entire United States.
[00:42:08.868 --> 00:42:10.790]  I'm recommending that people pick up rolls of 20.
[00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:16.346]  And they're at $261 per coin, and move on it now.
[00:42:16.666 --> 00:42:18.608]  Gold right now is sitting at $719.60 an ounce.
[00:42:18.628 --> 00:42:24.792]  But what if you're somebody like me, and you can only buy like four of those coins, five of those coins?
[00:42:24.812 --> 00:42:26.133]  Of course we'll service that order.
[00:42:26.153 --> 00:42:28.895]  If that's what you can afford, we recommend that you do what you can do.
[00:42:29.596 --> 00:42:33.619]  But, there's a lot of people out there that are looking at it, scratching their head, going, what do I do?
[00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:40.944]  Well, this is a nice way to get into a smaller piece of gold, something that's going to fit into a purse, into a pocket, something that you can put, it's portable.
[00:42:41.771 --> 00:42:47.873]  If we have trouble here in the United States, and I don't know how we're not going to have trouble here in the United States with the way that people are dumping the currency abroad.
[00:42:47.914 --> 00:42:50.595]  Ron Paul is saying we're going to have a massive depression.
[00:42:50.795 --> 00:42:51.995]  I hope the Congressman's wrong.
[00:42:52.375 --> 00:42:53.216]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:42:53.256 --> 00:42:58.678]  That's what you need to have, is you need to have something portable, private, something that you can put in your pocket, that you can bring with you.
[00:42:58.698 --> 00:43:01.619]  Because I can put you anywhere in the world, and this coin is going to hold value.
[00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:03.560]  You're going to be able to trade it for goods and services.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:03.920]  This is a U.S.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:04.220]  $5 piece?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:04.840]  It's a U.S.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.040]  $5 piece.
[00:43:07.541 --> 00:43:08.562]  Very recognizable.
[00:43:08.602 --> 00:43:09.882]  It comes straight out of the mint.
[00:43:10.263 --> 00:43:12.084]  They're in proof in business strike condition.
[00:43:12.104 --> 00:43:15.706]  They're still in the sealed holders from the mint.
[00:43:16.366 --> 00:43:20.509]  So you have actually a coin that, when you look at it, it's got a mirror finish to it.
[00:43:20.529 --> 00:43:21.089]  It's beautiful.
[00:43:21.189 --> 00:43:23.190]  The Constitution coin is one of them.
[00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:24.931]  The Congress coin is another.
[00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:26.592]  There's a whole long list of them that they make.
[00:43:27.192 --> 00:43:31.635]  But the nice part about it is, it is something that they've defined as a collector item.
[00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:42.584]  And so people are getting a collector item with collector value near what people are getting bullion for, and so that's what I like.
[00:43:42.604 --> 00:43:47.830]  I like to get numismatic near bullion, and that's what you're getting right now when you do this, folks.
[00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.812]  Do you have any of the $10 pieces left?
[00:43:50.032 --> 00:43:51.312]  Well, there's a few left.
[00:43:51.352 --> 00:43:52.713]  They're about $3 more.
[00:43:52.753 --> 00:43:55.774]  If you want to get the $10 pieces, go ahead and order those as well.
[00:43:55.894 --> 00:43:59.675]  And to lock this deal in, you've got to say the Alex Jones Show offer, right Tim?
[00:43:59.695 --> 00:43:59.835]  Yep.
[00:44:00.095 --> 00:44:00.775]  Yep, that's right.
[00:44:00.855 --> 00:44:01.755]  This is a special.
[00:44:01.835 --> 00:44:05.497]  I mean, you guys are selling gold hand over fist right now, so give them a call.
[00:44:05.517 --> 00:44:05.557]  800-686-2237.
[00:44:05.577 --> 00:44:05.937]  $10 pieces, $5 pieces.
[00:44:10.538 --> 00:44:10.598]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:44:10.618 --> 00:44:10.678]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:44:10.858 --> 00:44:12.960]  And the brokers will be there, what, until 6 or 7 tonight?
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:13.741]  Oh, they'll be there.
[00:44:13.801 --> 00:44:16.803]  I'll have people there at 11 o'clock tonight, no doubt.
[00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:17.244]  Okay, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:44:17.264 --> 00:44:19.686]  So even if you hear this tonight, you can call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:44:19.726 --> 00:44:21.528]  And sometimes Ted doesn't offer.
[00:44:34.859 --> 00:44:42.944]  I call him two or three days later, myself, wanting to get some coins to go bury in the ground, literally, and he goes, I'm sorry, that offer is no longer available, Alex.
[00:44:42.964 --> 00:44:43.544]  We sold out.
[00:44:44.045 --> 00:44:45.386]  So you need to call him now, 800-686-2237.
[00:44:45.486 --> 00:44:52.890]  Ted, I feel really good telling listeners to buy videos, buy water filters, buy gold.
[00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.051]  Everything I've told people to buy is real.
[00:44:55.131 --> 00:44:59.154]  I don't sell the snake oil like some of the pathetic other fake patriots out there.
[00:45:00.455 --> 00:45:03.697]  I'm not involved in that.
[00:45:03.717 --> 00:45:04.958]  I'm involved in real things.
[00:45:05.258 --> 00:45:06.479]  You're involved in real things.
[00:45:06.859 --> 00:45:07.980]  I commend you, Ted.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.721]  I hope people will call you and get some gold now.
[00:45:09.942 --> 00:45:15.465]  Well, the other nice thing about it, too, Alex, just think of all the listeners that took advantage of buying gold here just a couple years ago.
[00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:20.329]  Not only have they helped produce the Alex Jones Show and make a difference in this world,
[00:45:20.811 --> 00:45:26.893]  In addition to that, now they're sitting on something that's doubled in price, and they have twice as much value in their portfolio.
[00:45:27.353 --> 00:45:29.554]  Doubled?
[00:45:29.634 --> 00:45:31.074]  It's more than doubled, Ted!
[00:45:31.254 --> 00:45:33.435]  Yeah, it's been more than doubled, that's for sure.
[00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:36.976]  I mean, in silver, 200%.
[00:45:37.316 --> 00:45:40.957]  We were selling those bags of silver, and it's up more than 200%.
[00:45:41.217 --> 00:45:48.239]  And so, yeah, we've got to, you know, I just got to say, for starters, thank you very much.
[00:45:48.703 --> 00:45:53.926]  For being supportive and supporting the Alex Jones Show, Midas Resources, and Genesis Communications Network.
[00:45:54.406 --> 00:45:56.407]  That I gotta say, I'm very grateful for.
[00:45:56.807 --> 00:46:00.750]  But for you, the folks that are getting involved with it, you're putting together a position.
[00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.111]  It's like a savings account at the same time you're helping.
[00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.433]  You're helping carry the cause, and I just think that that's such a wonderful thing.
[00:46:06.453 --> 00:46:07.053]  All right, Ted.
[00:46:07.153 --> 00:46:08.775]  Ted, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:46:08.795 --> 00:46:09.175]  Take care.
[00:46:09.195 --> 00:46:09.876]  Yep, you too.
[00:46:10.116 --> 00:46:10.757]  Give him a call.
[00:46:10.777 --> 00:46:11.137]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:46:11.177 --> 00:46:15.621]  And I think gold's going to keep going up.
[00:46:15.761 --> 00:46:17.603]  I think it'll probably hit $1,000 in the next six months.
[00:46:17.643 --> 00:46:19.525]  It may go down to $600 again and then bounce up to $800.
[00:46:19.605 --> 00:46:21.667]  I think you'll see some bouncing up and down.
[00:46:21.687 --> 00:46:22.528]  That's what the graphs do.
[00:46:22.848 --> 00:46:23.368]  I don't care!
[00:46:23.388 --> 00:46:27.092]  If gold went down to $500 an ounce, I wouldn't dump any of the gold I've got.
[00:46:27.592 --> 00:46:29.074]  Because it's real, folks.
[00:46:29.114 --> 00:46:32.457]  There's at least some tangible value forever in it.
[00:46:32.817 --> 00:46:34.979]  It's not like these paper notes.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.023]  I just wish I would have bought more gold, but again, I'm not that capitalized, so I can't.
[00:46:39.964 --> 00:46:41.165]  You're crazy if you don't.
[00:46:41.733 --> 00:46:44.456]  Yeah, I think you should give them a call.
[00:46:44.476 --> 00:46:44.856]  800-686-2237.
[00:46:44.896 --> 00:46:46.137]  Again, I hardly ever talk about this.
[00:46:46.157 --> 00:46:46.918]  I don't get into it.
[00:46:47.739 --> 00:46:53.845]  I recommend three or four times a year you do this, and I'm telling you twice in one week you need to, because it could just go up and up and up.
[00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:59.771]  Alright, let me get into NSA, and then we'll get to Kathy, Eric, Taylor, Zane, and others.
[00:47:00.723 --> 00:47:01.764]  Okay, this is what's going on.
[00:47:02.324 --> 00:47:04.727]  They're announcing the spying to scare everybody.
[00:47:05.307 --> 00:47:09.391]  Then Bush gets told you're a criminal, then he claims he's above the law and allowed to do it.
[00:47:09.831 --> 00:47:16.817]  They're now announcing they're listening to everything you're doing and everything you're up to, because they know Bush's approval rating now dropped another point to 29%.
[00:47:17.558 --> 00:47:19.199]  This is an attempt at a chilling effect.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:25.585]  So what if the NSA hears tens of millions of Americans saying we know the government's rogue and criminal?
[00:47:26.738 --> 00:47:27.638]  They're the crooks!
[00:47:27.959 --> 00:47:29.399]  They're the ones that ought to be afraid.
[00:47:29.599 --> 00:47:31.020]  This does not intimidate me.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:37.223]  Then their lawyers come out and say, we're allowed to do this because you signed a contract saying that we can give your info to whoever we want.
[00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:46.147]  But that's not true because the government coerced industry and paid them, this is racketeering, nine billion dollars to put these snooping hubs in from 96 to 2001.
[00:47:46.887 --> 00:47:54.671]  Look how they set that all up just for right up to 9-11, one month after 9-11, September, October, boom, six years before set up to start October 1st.
[00:47:55.311 --> 00:47:57.675]  Your cell phones track you down to three feet.
[00:47:58.656 --> 00:47:59.237]  It's sick!
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.564]  It's totally and completely sick!
[00:48:04.705 --> 00:48:06.108]  But the good news is this...
[00:48:07.529 --> 00:48:10.670]  Seventy-two in Congress joined battle against wiretaps.
[00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:17.072]  Seventy-two members of Congress filed papers late Wednesday seeking to end President George W. Bush's warrantless NSA eavesdropping program.
[00:48:17.532 --> 00:48:29.316]  The filing came just before a report Thursday in USA Today which revealed the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretapping program had collected call records on tens of millions of Americans through agreements with AT&T, Verizon, and Bell South.
[00:48:29.716 --> 00:48:31.637]  Bell South and AT&T have merged.
[00:48:32.197 --> 00:48:38.441]  It also comes a day after lawyers looking at NSA program abruptly closed their probe after the Bush administration refused to grant them clearances.
[00:48:40.482 --> 00:48:41.443]  This is unbelievable.
[00:48:41.963 --> 00:48:43.064]  This is unbelievable.
[00:48:44.745 --> 00:48:50.408]  Again, the minute men are vigilantes and are being spied on by the government, that information is given to the Mexican troops that kill our own police.
[00:48:51.049 --> 00:48:56.012]  But then, they're going to spy on all Americans after they told you it was only Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:56.852 --> 00:48:58.593]  And, oh, it's to keep you safe from terrorists.
[00:48:58.693 --> 00:49:00.255]  It's a sick joke.
[00:49:00.755 --> 00:49:01.816]  It's outrageous.
[00:49:03.457 --> 00:49:04.858]  Let's talk to Kathy in Virginia.
[00:49:04.878 --> 00:49:05.579]  Kathy, go ahead.
[00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:06.760]  Yes, thanks, Alex.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:14.285]  I want to share something brief that I'd like to share to help and maybe warn your listeners some food for thought.
[00:49:14.746 --> 00:49:22.772]  You know, you take a young man growing up in a hovel in Mexico, and he comes up here and makes a few dollars enough to make a payment on a big, macho pickup truck.
[00:49:23.223 --> 00:49:27.046]  Two weeks ago, I dropped off some recyclables right behind the new Day Labor Center.
[00:49:27.066 --> 00:49:29.788]  It's been in the news recently in Herndon, Virginia.
[00:49:29.808 --> 00:49:33.771]  I was waiting to make a right-hand turn when I hear a big BOOM crash!
[00:49:34.171 --> 00:49:37.934]  And then a big black pickup truck is headed sideways towards my Grand Dam.
[00:49:38.434 --> 00:49:47.681]  And the next second after impact, he flipped up on top of my hood, crashing, banging, everything falling off his truck, glass shattering.
[00:49:48.042 --> 00:49:50.964]  It was a hideous accident, but fortunately, nobody was seriously hurt.
[00:49:51.533 --> 00:49:58.279]  But my point is, these very, very poor people do not understand the power behind these huge machines that they're operating.
[00:49:58.299 --> 00:49:59.921]  Let me stop you, and I'll hold you over if need be.
[00:49:59.941 --> 00:50:00.822]  This is so key.
[00:50:01.322 --> 00:50:06.507]  It's not just the leprosy going from three cases a year to 7,000, Associated Press.
[00:50:06.867 --> 00:50:10.410]  Leper colonies now in East Texas have actually set up leper colonies.
[00:50:10.731 --> 00:50:12.592]  It's not the drug-immune-resistant TB.
[00:50:12.993 --> 00:50:13.813]  It's not the crime.
[00:50:14.967 --> 00:50:27.279]  Statistically, they had an article out of North Carolina a few months ago showing that in North Carolina, illegals are only 8% of the population, but they were 30-something percent, I forget the exact number, it was in the news, of the wrecks.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.243]  And literally, I mean, I'm worried about 16-year-olds, folks.
[00:50:31.283 --> 00:50:32.785]  I can't believe my parents gave me a car.
[00:50:33.525 --> 00:50:36.066]  I mean, I had a bunch of wrecks then, and I really haven't had wrecks since.
[00:50:36.106 --> 00:50:37.766]  I've had one where a tornado blew me off the road.
[00:50:38.286 --> 00:50:40.567]  And the point is, these people don't have driver's license, nothing.
[00:50:40.867 --> 00:50:43.447]  They just get in a car, no driver's safety, no nothing.
[00:50:43.988 --> 00:50:47.808]  And it is, I mean, it is, it's so horrible.
[00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:48.289]  Stay there.
[00:50:48.849 --> 00:50:49.889]  I mean, it is scary.
[00:50:49.909 --> 00:50:53.410]  You're going down I-35, these illegal aliens, drop, drive, do whatever they want.
[00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:56.331]  It is so dangerous.
[00:50:56.351 --> 00:50:56.951]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:57.571]  Stay there, Kathy.
[00:50:57.591 --> 00:50:58.091]  I want to hear more.
[00:51:01.991 --> 00:51:06.333]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.513 --> 00:51:10.876]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:13.382 --> 00:51:15.483]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:15.583 --> 00:51:18.305]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.645 --> 00:51:22.868]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.928 --> 00:51:29.852]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.992 --> 00:51:31.993]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.253 --> 00:51:42.695]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.975 --> 00:51:48.356]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:52.076]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.096 --> 00:51:52.617]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:52.637 --> 00:51:53.917]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.539 --> 00:52:09.063]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.343 --> 00:52:20.249]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.529 --> 00:52:22.309]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:25.910]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:36.713]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.993 --> 00:52:37.493]  That's right!
[00:52:37.673 --> 00:52:44.795]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.075 --> 00:52:49.936]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter, complete with
[00:52:50.356 --> 00:52:50.916]  We're good to go!
[00:53:18.869 --> 00:53:19.529]  We're good to go!
[00:53:48.405 --> 00:53:51.488]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:51.649 --> 00:53:57.515]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:04.614 --> 00:54:05.135]  Don't worry.
[00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.117]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.617 --> 00:54:10.380]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.682 --> 00:54:13.704]  My friends, this is not hype.
[00:54:14.505 --> 00:54:17.128]  The illegal aliens are allowed to drunk drive everything.
[00:54:17.168 --> 00:54:18.189]  Cops take them to jail.
[00:54:18.209 --> 00:54:21.552]  I have a lot of friends that are police, but they get let right back out.
[00:54:22.623 --> 00:54:23.885]  Uh, and it's horrible.
[00:54:23.945 --> 00:54:27.468]  I mean, I have been hit several times just rear-ended at red lights by illegal aliens.
[00:54:28.009 --> 00:54:30.812]  And they get out and start crying and say, no insurance, please let me go.
[00:54:30.852 --> 00:54:33.395]  And I just, I just throw my hands up and leave.
[00:54:33.695 --> 00:54:34.376]  Okay, fine.
[00:54:35.437 --> 00:54:50.152]  Uh, in fact, one time I barely rear-ended an illegal alien, and they just said, no police, no police, no insurance, you know, just... I mean, to be fair, I was in a Wendy's parking lot, and barely bumped him, there was a little bit of scratch on their car, so I've done it too, but the point is, is that there's no insurance, no nothing.
[00:54:50.493 --> 00:54:52.835]  Kathy, so you got hit and hit pretty hard, what happened?
[00:54:53.277 --> 00:54:58.499]  Well, he made a left turn in front of a van and tried to beat out this young lady in the van.
[00:54:58.779 --> 00:55:03.060]  But the other point I wanted to make, as I said, it was right exactly... So what happened after the wreck?
[00:55:03.581 --> 00:55:04.841]  Well, that's what I want to say.
[00:55:04.941 --> 00:55:10.183]  It was right next to that, where the illegal aliens go at that new day labor site.
[00:55:10.543 --> 00:55:16.085]  So there were like, oh, 10, 15 buddies around him, getting him out of the truck, hovering around him.
[00:55:16.125 --> 00:55:21.207]  But the two white women that he involved, the van and then me, who was innocently
[00:55:21.912 --> 00:55:28.718]  Just sitting there in my car, because there was no concern whatsoever while we were waiting for the ambulance to come about us.
[00:55:28.838 --> 00:55:30.019]  You weren't part of the Raza?
[00:55:30.039 --> 00:55:36.205]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, they were all just hovering around him and worried about him and they were just...
[00:55:37.628 --> 00:55:39.269]  What did the police do when they got there?
[00:55:39.329 --> 00:55:40.269]  No charges, right?
[00:55:40.689 --> 00:55:41.089]  Oh, yes.
[00:55:41.269 --> 00:55:43.090]  Yes, he was charged with reckless driving.
[00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:45.050]  He was charged with the accident.
[00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:46.851]  And he was charged with reckless driving.
[00:55:46.891 --> 00:55:49.731]  But he'll just, he'll just revolving door go out of the jail.
[00:55:49.751 --> 00:55:52.452]  Or if he stays in the jail, we'll all pay for it.
[00:55:52.852 --> 00:55:53.852]  Well, he didn't go to the jail.
[00:55:53.872 --> 00:55:55.153]  He went to the hospital, you see.
[00:55:55.713 --> 00:55:56.293]  But do you have any...
[00:55:56.613 --> 00:56:12.761]  I mean I've been all over Mexico and I've driven in Mexico and I mean folks anybody who's been there knows I'm telling the truth they drive like psychopathic maniacs running red lights everywhere the police don't think anything of it and they have to put huge speed humps all over the highways because people drive so recklessly.
[00:56:13.321 --> 00:56:19.164]  I was with a Mexican cab driver a few months ago and I said slow down and he was going like 80 miles an hour.
[00:56:19.184 --> 00:56:21.785]  Well do you have any advice?
[00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:23.006]  Now I'm going to show up at his
[00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:26.613]  His, um, court hearing for the reckless driving.
[00:56:26.653 --> 00:56:28.094]  Do you have any kind of advice for me?
[00:56:28.494 --> 00:56:32.155]  Demand that he be fully charged and kept in jail or he'll go out and kill somebody.
[00:56:32.175 --> 00:56:32.956]  Oh, okay.
[00:56:33.296 --> 00:56:38.418]  So they can, um, if they charge him with reckless driving, they can, uh, we can demand that he be jailed?
[00:56:40.017 --> 00:56:40.537]  Absolutely.
[00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:43.820]  Willful, reckless driving that caused injuries to someone else.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.861]  There's a bunch of different charges on that.
[00:56:45.922 --> 00:56:47.102]  Plus, he's an illegal alien.
[00:56:47.122 --> 00:56:49.124]  If he's an illegal alien, he needs to be deported.
[00:56:49.544 --> 00:56:53.728]  Yeah, I don't know if he is an illegal alien, but there's one good twist to the story.
[00:56:54.108 --> 00:56:56.410]  Believe it or not, he actually had insurance.
[00:56:57.574 --> 00:56:59.354]  So he was there picking up the day laborers.
[00:56:59.855 --> 00:57:01.355]  I have no idea what he was doing there.
[00:57:01.595 --> 00:57:09.417]  Because of course, now when he, when it first, first crashed and he flipped on top of me in very, very plain English, he said to me, get me out of here!
[00:57:09.757 --> 00:57:10.697]  I heard that twice.
[00:57:11.037 --> 00:57:20.440]  But then, the insurance agent, when I talked to his insurance agent, he said, well we had to switch over to a Spanish speaking agent because they don't speak any English.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.760]  But boy, he sure knew how to say, get me out of here!
[00:57:23.041 --> 00:57:24.441]  I hear you, I appreciate your call.
[00:57:25.536 --> 00:57:26.598]  I'm glad you're okay.
[00:57:27.038 --> 00:57:30.242]  And folks, if we had 25 million Russians here, I'd be just as angry.
[00:57:30.843 --> 00:57:35.889]  And we always talk about Mexicans, Mexicans, Mexicans, because that's 80%, ladies and gentlemen, of the illegal aliens.
[00:57:36.827 --> 00:57:38.468]  And it's horrible.
[00:57:38.548 --> 00:57:40.109]  I mean, it is an epidemic.
[00:57:40.149 --> 00:57:53.515]  Just type into Google, illegal alien auto accidents, or illegal aliens driving without insurance, and you'll get... I mean, every day or two, tractor-trailer flips over with 40 illegals in trailer on Icy Road, didn't have insurance or driver's license.
[00:57:53.595 --> 00:57:54.455]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:57:54.475 --> 00:57:58.177]  These are hard-working folks that come up here, they work, they get cars, they drive around.
[00:57:58.197 --> 00:58:00.918]  And it's just... it's a nightmare.
[00:58:02.233 --> 00:58:04.294]  We're going to break and come back and jam in your calls.
[00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:09.757]  We're going to go to Eric and Taylor and Zane and John and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[00:58:11.218 --> 00:58:16.281]  And we'll have a free-for-all too with calls into the second and third hours.
[00:58:16.321 --> 00:58:17.381]  Two big guests coming up.
[00:58:18.342 --> 00:58:25.686]  But really, they were having on average of three leprosy cases a year until 2004.
[00:58:25.786 --> 00:58:27.387]  There were 7,000 cases.
[00:58:27.987 --> 00:58:28.988]  We got those numbers in 05.
[00:58:29.328 --> 00:58:30.708]  We haven't gotten 05 numbers yet.
[00:58:30.728 --> 00:58:31.589]  They come out a year later.
[00:58:33.273 --> 00:58:35.095]  I mean, wet leprosy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:35.195 --> 00:58:36.416]  Leprosy is spreading.
[00:58:36.436 --> 00:58:39.479]  7,000 plus cases.
[00:58:41.601 --> 00:58:46.145]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.165 --> 00:58:46.245]  Help!
[00:58:46.265 --> 00:58:46.565]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.472 --> 00:59:00.533]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.234 --> 00:59:02.334]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.995 --> 00:59:03.816]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.576 --> 00:59:05.477]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.497 --> 00:59:09.921]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.321 --> 00:59:14.424]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.105 --> 00:59:17.807]  Got two big guests coming up.
[00:59:20.009 --> 00:59:20.309]  We got
[00:59:21.275 --> 00:59:24.858]  Medical doctor Reema Laboe coming up to talk about a bunch of key issues.
[00:59:24.898 --> 00:59:26.059]  We'll tell you about that when she comes up.
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:36.068]  Then we have the high-level multi-star general joining us to talk about some incredible issues later in this hour as well, into the third hour.
[00:59:36.128 --> 00:59:38.150]  Right now, let's go right back to your calls, get some more in.
[00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:41.212]  Zane, Zane, where are you calling us from today?
[00:59:42.894 --> 00:59:43.134]  Hello?
[00:59:43.694 --> 00:59:45.116]  Yes, Zane, where are you calling us from?
[00:59:45.396 --> 00:59:46.176]  South Carolina.
[00:59:46.377 --> 00:59:46.697]  Welcome.
[00:59:47.523 --> 00:59:47.843]  Thank you.
[00:59:47.883 --> 00:59:49.285]  I'd just like to make a few points.
[00:59:50.045 --> 00:59:54.689]  I'm a senior at high school at Eastside High School in Greer, South Carolina.
[00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:55.110]  Yes.
[00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:59.854]  I was listening to these two females talking about Independence Day.
[01:00:00.534 --> 01:00:09.302]  They had just figured out why we celebrated July the 4th, and they had no earthly idea that the Constitution was separate from the Declaration of Independence.
[01:00:11.468 --> 01:00:18.390]  Well, I was talking to a British film crew who was here, and they were freaked out because multiple times they had people go, Oh, you're English!
[01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:20.430]  Does that mean you come from that place called England?
[01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:25.411]  And of course, this harkens back to the big geography bee studies they do every year.
[01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:29.372]  Two-thirds of people 18 to 24 can't find Iraq on a map.
[01:00:30.412 --> 01:00:35.333]  I mean, it's supposed to be a place of learning where we learn these two girls are in a U.S.
[01:00:35.353 --> 01:00:37.994]  history class, and they should have learned it, but
[01:00:38.564 --> 01:00:39.865]  They just don't care anymore.
[01:00:39.885 --> 01:00:45.567]  I'd also like to make a point of, um... Working at a, um... Working as a Boy Scout leader.
[01:00:45.587 --> 01:00:47.728]  I just made Eagle Scout when I turned 18.
[01:00:47.788 --> 01:00:50.069]  I decided to stay on as a Boy Scout leader.
[01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:53.731]  I was talking to the main leader, and he wanted my email address.
[01:00:54.431 --> 01:00:56.292]  You know, it's Zane with M4, whatever.
[01:00:56.632 --> 01:00:59.794]  And he said, you know, as paramilitary, Homeland Security's gonna be all over you.
[01:01:00.214 --> 01:01:01.415]  And I said, I already know they are.
[01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:06.077]  Being a survivalist, whenever I order a survival supply, or a paramilitary style...
[01:01:07.627 --> 01:01:08.688]  It's always delayed.
[01:01:08.888 --> 01:01:09.829]  Wait a minute.
[01:01:09.869 --> 01:01:10.750]  You're an Eagle Scout.
[01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:12.051]  You're a leader.
[01:01:12.551 --> 01:01:16.675]  The leader above you said you can't have that address with InfoWars.
[01:01:17.256 --> 01:01:24.542]  Oh, see, this is the... Well, you know in South Carolina they have the anti-terror training manual that says any property rights activist... We're all terrorists.
[01:01:24.883 --> 01:01:27.205]  Any red-blooded American is a terrorist.
[01:01:27.805 --> 01:01:29.727]  And this shows the Stasi mentality.
[01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:31.709]  So he knew what InfoWars was, huh?
[01:01:32.472 --> 01:01:34.732]  He didn't know what it was, but he thought it was too paramilitary.
[01:01:35.013 --> 01:01:49.635]  Whenever I order a paramilitary style object for survivalist, you know, supplies, it is always delayed in Greenville, it's always opened, all the packages are always open, it's always, the box is always roughed up, and you can always see where they used a different type of tape.
[01:01:49.695 --> 01:01:52.656]  Oh yeah, that's our free country, sir, that's our free country.
[01:01:52.896 --> 01:02:02.078]  I flew back from New York and bought my daughter a silver baby rattle at Tiffany's, it was like 80 bucks, and they got into my bags that I checked,
[01:02:02.558 --> 01:02:08.603]  They pulled it out, they unwrapped it out of the wrapper, didn't even re-wrap the packaging, ripped the packaging off, and threw the rattle in the bag.
[01:02:08.863 --> 01:02:10.004]  That's our free country, sir.
[01:02:10.204 --> 01:02:12.606]  Having our stuff dug through, our mail read.
[01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:14.928]  Does it make you sick?
[01:02:16.509 --> 01:02:20.132]  Freedom of an Eagle Scout, and they're supposed to be fighting a war to give us freedom?
[01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:22.815]  And they make me the terrorist, and that makes me sick.
[01:02:24.696 --> 01:02:25.897]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:02:25.957 --> 01:02:26.978]  It's good they're real patriots.
[01:02:27.378 --> 01:02:27.558]  One more.
[01:02:28.039 --> 01:02:28.519]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:31.802]  Do you still have... I had a teacher who didn't believe me that police
[01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:36.537]  We're tasering little kids, so I told her I'd find five articles where they tasered someone under the skin.
[01:02:36.577 --> 01:02:41.559]  Just type into Google, six-year-old tasered, five-year-old tasered, child tasered, you'll get it.
[01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:44.499]  You still have that taser archive on InfoWars.com?
[01:02:44.879 --> 01:02:47.280]  Yeah, somewhere in there, but it's all over the news, sir.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.061]  Just go to Google and type in child tasered and you'll get hundreds.
[01:02:50.561 --> 01:02:51.141]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.441]  Thank you, good to hear from you.
[01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:54.502]  Let's jam in Chad in Texas.
[01:02:54.582 --> 01:02:55.382]  Chad, go ahead.
[01:02:55.402 --> 01:02:57.243]  Hello?
[01:02:57.523 --> 01:02:58.003]  Yes, Chad.
[01:02:58.655 --> 01:03:00.457]  Yeah, I've got a couple quick things.
[01:03:01.137 --> 01:03:05.861]  The other night they had that worship piece on about Donald Rumsfeld on Fox News.
[01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:07.983]  About what a great leader he is, yes?
[01:03:08.103 --> 01:03:10.505]  Oh yeah, like he was, you know, God and everything.
[01:03:10.625 --> 01:03:14.548]  And I don't know if you heard about what he said when they asked him about 9-11.
[01:03:15.569 --> 01:03:16.449]  He said, fabulous.
[01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:21.834]  Well, he had a piece of the plane and he says, you know, this is a piece of plane that hit Pentagon.
[01:03:21.874 --> 01:03:23.375]  And the reporter says, fabulous.
[01:03:24.184 --> 01:03:27.145]  Yeah, and he says, uh, yes, I like to look at it.
[01:03:27.185 --> 01:03:30.325]  It's a reminder of what happened and who we are.
[01:03:30.345 --> 01:03:39.567]  You know, like, that's just a weird, you know, uh, one of those Freudian things that most people, you know, hidden in plain sight deal.
[01:03:39.767 --> 01:03:43.548]  Well, he just said twice that a missile hit the Pentagon, and he said twice they shot down 93.
[01:03:43.588 --> 01:03:46.989]  Do you have anything else you want to add, Chad?
[01:03:47.009 --> 01:03:47.749]  Yeah, really quick.
[01:03:47.769 --> 01:03:48.249]  Well, stay there.
[01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:51.290]  I've got to get the guest on, but I'll go back to you, because I don't want to shortchange you.
[01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:51.650]  Stay there.
[01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:52.310]  Everybody stay there.
[01:03:54.935 --> 01:03:57.777]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.018 --> 01:03:59.619]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.959 --> 01:04:04.623]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.963 --> 01:04:11.709]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:14.009]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:17.050]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:21.811]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.011 --> 01:04:26.412]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.652 --> 01:04:33.894]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.134 --> 01:04:36.555]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.715 --> 01:04:38.435]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:54.255 --> 01:04:55.856]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:55.996 --> 01:05:00.120]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.122]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:03.202 --> 01:05:09.927]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:10.108 --> 01:05:13.110]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.712]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:15.832 --> 01:05:20.556]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:05:20.776 --> 01:05:35.300]  Fryhalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:42.082]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[01:05:45.263 --> 01:05:49.745]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:09.150]  We're good to go.
[01:06:32.065 --> 01:06:34.766]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.163 --> 01:07:10.495]  Dr. Rima E. Labo is our guest medical doctor and this is going to be an interesting interview.
[01:07:10.515 --> 01:07:17.425]  We're going to be mixing in multiple subjects together and we'll go to your calls early in this hour so I know it'll be all over the map.
[01:07:18.926 --> 01:07:28.208]  And then of course her husband, we're just having them both on together at the same time, is Albert N. Stubblebine III, Major General, U.S.
[01:07:28.308 --> 01:07:29.268]  Army, retired.
[01:07:31.329 --> 01:07:35.890]  Others bill him as kind of an expert in unconventional weapons, and we don't mean WMDs, folks.
[01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:39.071]  We mean, I guess, weapons of the mind, mind sciences.
[01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:44.772]  I would call him the father, that's what he's called, of remote viewing, which we've never discussed on this broadcast.
[01:07:45.572 --> 01:07:47.913]  Now, I'm not saying it's real or it's not real.
[01:07:48.554 --> 01:07:52.235]  I'm just saying it's real that they have these projects, and I've read some of the speeches he's given.
[01:07:52.275 --> 01:08:04.161]  He can't get into too much on it because a lot of it's classified, but he ran these programs, and so he's like the leader of the good guys in the X-Files or something, or maybe the X-Men.
[01:08:04.642 --> 01:08:05.442]  So I don't even know.
[01:08:05.462 --> 01:08:08.884]  I mean, this is just wild stuff, and both our guests are extremely intelligent.
[01:08:09.344 --> 01:08:30.535]  And first we're going to be talking about the Codex Alimentarius, which I am up on, this big international move by the drug companies to get laws passed at the state level, I mean the nation-state level, to restrict even over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, vitamin C, and very, very serious, we saw Clinton raid the, back in the early 90s, raid the
[01:08:31.468 --> 01:08:31.688]  Thank you.
[01:08:53.131 --> 01:09:05.018]  First off, Doctor, tell us a little bit about yourself, Dr. LeBeau and LeBow, and then we'll get into Mr. Stubblebine's history, just so listeners know who we've got on.
[01:09:05.778 --> 01:09:06.819]  Well, I'm a physician.
[01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:12.902]  I've been practicing drug-free, natural medicine for better than 35 years.
[01:09:12.962 --> 01:09:18.045]  I was graduated from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine with an MD degree in 1970.
[01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:36.195]  I was trained in psychiatry, child, adolescent, adult psychiatry and throughout my entire career I have been asking non-allopathic, non-conventional medicine questions that all have a similar thrust.
[01:09:36.295 --> 01:09:38.437]  The thrust is about why.
[01:09:38.996 --> 01:09:41.897]  Whereas allopathic medicine only looks at how.
[01:09:42.037 --> 01:09:43.698]  How do we suppress this symptom?
[01:09:44.118 --> 01:09:46.099]  How do we make this problem go away?
[01:09:46.559 --> 01:09:54.443]  I've been asking why does the problem occur and then what's the best way to fix the problem at the causal level?
[01:09:54.463 --> 01:09:57.925]  So you're trying to fix the cause instead of treating the symptoms?
[01:09:58.225 --> 01:09:58.965]  Precisely!
[01:09:59.585 --> 01:10:03.307]  And the best way is never, in my estimation,
[01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:10.189]  If you're not dealing with acute or traumatic situations, the best way is never to poison enzyme systems.
[01:10:10.209 --> 01:10:12.190]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.991]  And that's what every drug does.
[01:10:15.431 --> 01:10:17.092]  Well, that's my view on the hospital.
[01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:20.454]  When I break a leg or cut a finger off, I go to the hospital.
[01:10:20.834 --> 01:10:23.655]  But I don't go to the doctor for anything else.
[01:10:24.236 --> 01:10:24.836]  Certainly not.
[01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:25.996]  Not if you want to be healthy.
[01:10:28.317 --> 01:10:30.118]  Doctors are not trained in health.
[01:10:30.198 --> 01:10:31.239]  They're trained in illness.
[01:10:31.299 --> 01:10:33.500]  And they are therefore part of the illness industry.
[01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:40.641]  And they are not only destroying our economy, they are killing our population, most of them unwittingly.
[01:10:41.062 --> 01:10:55.907]  So when I look at health, I look at clean, unadulterated food, and I look at nutrients, vitamins, minerals in supply to allow people to develop abundant health.
[01:10:55.967 --> 01:11:00.789]  And the more toxic our world is, the higher the doses of the nutrients that we need.
[01:11:02.048 --> 01:11:09.890]  Which is run by and which serves the purposes of the five big elements in our world.
[01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:15.851]  That's Big Pharma, Big Chema, Big Agribiz, Big Biotechna, and Big Medica.
[01:11:16.151 --> 01:11:28.034]  Codex would like to have healthy people disappear because they're bad customers and to be able to do anything it wants to the food supply and take away nutrients
[01:11:28.686 --> 01:11:30.847]  Domestically and internationally.
[01:11:31.088 --> 01:11:37.511]  Now Doctor, at the same time, I want to go over some of the history of Codex Alimentarius, what we're facing.
[01:11:37.812 --> 01:11:49.599]  Because a lot of people, even though I've read the documents, I've seen the laws they're trying to pass in Europe and here, some of the laws they have passed in Europe, the general public is still in denial, the people I talk to, oh they're not going to ban or restrict my vitamins, you're crazy!
[01:11:49.979 --> 01:11:52.561]  Even when this is happening, so I want to go over that with you.
[01:11:53.021 --> 01:11:57.704]  Then we're also going to shift gears later into some other subjects, but both of you can speak to this.
[01:11:58.404 --> 01:12:04.806]  General, please tell us about your history and some of the things we'll be discussing today as well, because we're really honored to have you on.
[01:12:04.866 --> 01:12:08.066]  Both of you are kind of Renaissance individuals.
[01:12:08.086 --> 01:12:10.627]  You're involved in so much, I don't even know where to start.
[01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:19.689]  Well, I started out as an Army brat, so I was actually in the Army from the day I was born.
[01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:24.807]  I graduated from West Point Military Academy in 1952.
[01:12:25.047 --> 01:12:31.293]  I've commanded at every level from second lieutenant all the way up to major general.
[01:12:32.634 --> 01:12:44.385]  My last assignments as a general officer, I had the intelligence center in school down at Fort Huachuca, so I've actually been a school marm, which was a fascinating assignment.
[01:12:45.329 --> 01:13:00.141]  I then was the Commanding General of the Electronic Research and Development Command, so I had seven different Army R&D labs, so I've done quite a bit of work in the research and development world.
[01:13:00.902 --> 01:13:09.229]  And then my last assignment had all of the strategic intelligence forces in the Army.
[01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:12.772]  These are the Army strategic intelligence forces around the world.
[01:13:13.925 --> 01:13:29.880]  So I've got a very wide, very diffuse set of experiences and actually loved all of them.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.342]  Absolutely, and I just want to give people a hint of what's coming up later.
[01:13:36.103 --> 01:13:40.406]  Remote viewing, you are recognized as the father of what is known as remote viewing.
[01:13:40.906 --> 01:13:45.089]  Can you tell us how far you can go today and how much you can discuss?
[01:13:45.969 --> 01:13:53.194]  Well, I'm not sure whether I'm the father, maybe the uncle-in-law, anyway.
[01:13:53.374 --> 01:13:54.835]  Well, you certainly brought it into the army.
[01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:13.116]  I was the boss, I guess is what you'd say, of the Army's remote viewing resources when I had INSCOM.
[01:14:14.296 --> 01:14:17.678]  And, you know, a lot of people think, is it real?
[01:14:18.078 --> 01:14:19.559]  And the answer is, yeah.
[01:14:20.339 --> 01:14:22.260]  The answer is, it is very real.
[01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:25.742]  And it is very usable and very workable.
[01:14:28.152 --> 01:14:33.294]  It takes training, it takes skill, it takes careful management, but it works.
[01:14:34.854 --> 01:14:42.497]  I want to get into that, because it's funny, a book was written about me, and I've tried to be friendly about it, but the thing is a work of fiction.
[01:14:42.517 --> 01:14:49.660]  I don't know if you know this, but Ronson wrote Them, and I'm like three chapters of it, and my movie's even being made about it by Jack Black.
[01:14:50.575 --> 01:14:57.216]  And I contacted Jack Black and said, fine, I'm glad you're making a movie about it, but just please know, a lot of this stuff in here is not true.
[01:14:57.256 --> 01:15:02.017]  I mean, John Ronson's got me cowering in the bushes afraid of vampires, literally, folks.
[01:15:02.417 --> 01:15:05.918]  The guy is just, I'm not going to even give him any attention.
[01:15:05.938 --> 01:15:15.400]  I don't want to get too much into that today, but I can give you a chance to set the record straight if you'd like, because I don't think you'll find many people that have been in the same crosshairs as you, General.
[01:15:18.984 --> 01:15:21.825]  I can tell you what, I have never killed a goat with my mind.
[01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:29.148]  No, I haven't walked through a wall either.
[01:15:30.288 --> 01:15:40.052]  There are certainly some extensions of the process in describing it, I think, for sensationalism.
[01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:49.507]  You know, when it first came out and I first learned about it, the impulse was to sue somebody and I finally said, I'm not going to give them
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:53.142]  The opportunity to get the publicity.
[01:15:53.222 --> 01:15:54.262]  I'm just not going to go there.
[01:15:54.543 --> 01:16:03.547]  Well I know John, he followed me around for about a year off and on and then he acts real friendly and then in the final equation I still want to like the guy.
[01:16:03.668 --> 01:16:05.028]  I mean I can't knock him that bad.
[01:16:05.048 --> 01:16:07.249]  There's going to be a movie made about me because of it.
[01:16:07.670 --> 01:16:15.234]  It's just it's not going to be... I mean he calls it satire so I think he thinks he can get away with it but people don't read that stuff as satire.
[01:16:15.774 --> 01:16:16.374]  No they don't.
[01:16:17.737 --> 01:16:45.446]  Well, just very quickly Alex, we didn't know that we knew John Ronson because the person that Bert and I spoke to, primarily Bert, presented himself under a totally different name as a BBC videographer making a documentary and much to our surprise we later discovered that that person turned out to have been Ronson with a cameraman who wasn't apparently
[01:16:45.951 --> 01:16:47.712]  I just don't want to give it any more traction.
[01:17:13.723 --> 01:17:15.124]  Well, we're going to break here in just a moment.
[01:17:15.144 --> 01:17:20.606]  Let's get into Codex Alimentarius, and great to tell when we get back, and then we really appreciate your time.
[01:17:20.646 --> 01:17:28.449]  It's very gracious, and I want to spend a lot of time on the military and, you know, some of the things you developed, and this is a real treat to have both of you on.
[01:17:28.469 --> 01:17:33.091]  We're about to break here in a minute, but Doctor, would you like to begin getting into the history?
[01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:41.895]  Codex Alimentarius came out of the fertile mind of a convicted Nazi war criminal after the Nuremberg War Tribunal.
[01:17:41.935 --> 01:17:42.795]  The head manager
[01:17:43.228 --> 01:17:43.528]  Thank you.
[01:17:59.386 --> 01:18:00.347]  And he said, I've got it.
[01:18:00.487 --> 01:18:02.449]  We'll take over the world's food supply.
[01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:15.884]  So when he got out four years later in 1952 and went back to work at the president level of Bayer Pharmaceutical, which had been part of IG Farben, the same people who make Bayer Aspirin, of course,
[01:18:16.579 --> 01:18:21.141]  He went to his friends at the UN and he said, Hey, I've got a cool idea.
[01:18:21.181 --> 01:18:23.162]  We can take over the world's food supply.
[01:18:23.582 --> 01:18:25.823]  And they said, Yeah, let's do that.
[01:18:26.223 --> 01:18:33.927]  Ten years later, the Codex Alimentarius Commission was born and it began setting standards, regulations and guidelines
[01:18:34.561 --> 01:18:41.728]  Dr. Labo, we've got a break.
[01:18:41.848 --> 01:18:43.510]  General Stubblebine, we've got a break.
[01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:45.852]  Husband and wife, very interesting folks.
[01:18:45.912 --> 01:18:47.373]  This has been so much today.
[01:18:47.734 --> 01:18:49.095]  Your phone call is coming up as well.
[01:18:49.335 --> 01:18:50.436]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:51.097]  Please stay with us.
[01:18:54.068 --> 01:18:56.149]  Gene, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:58.571]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[01:18:58.891 --> 01:18:59.552]  New toenails?
[01:18:59.932 --> 01:19:00.933]  What happened to the old ones?
[01:19:01.913 --> 01:19:04.575]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.561]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:09.364]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[01:19:09.584 --> 01:19:10.965]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[01:19:11.406 --> 01:19:13.107]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[01:19:13.247 --> 01:19:14.609]  My toenails are a disaster.
[01:19:14.649 --> 01:19:17.451]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[01:19:17.671 --> 01:19:18.933]  Well, here's my secret.
[01:19:19.493 --> 01:19:20.534]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:21.014 --> 01:19:25.078]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[01:19:25.799 --> 01:19:26.700]  Ah, so that's it.
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:29.502]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[01:19:29.762 --> 01:19:31.404]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[01:19:31.904 --> 01:19:34.967]  You'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[01:19:35.367 --> 01:19:35.928]  You bet!
[01:19:36.128 --> 01:19:40.231]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[01:19:40.391 --> 01:19:41.912]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:42.313 --> 01:19:43.454]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:43.614 --> 01:19:45.275]  For clear, healthy looking nails.
[01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:50.740]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:51.961]  In the foot care section.
[01:19:55.567 --> 01:19:56.608]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:57.009 --> 01:20:02.495]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:03.076 --> 01:20:03.576]  That's right.
[01:20:03.877 --> 01:20:06.159]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:13.668]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:14.207 --> 01:20:21.911]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:22.331 --> 01:20:27.154]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:27.817 --> 01:20:32.839]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.639 --> 01:20:37.760]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:38.400]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.341]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.401 --> 01:20:40.701]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.021 --> 01:20:41.281]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.002 --> 01:21:04.724]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:21:04.904 --> 01:21:12.486]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:21:12.726 --> 01:21:15.887]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:21:16.147 --> 01:21:21.889]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:28.331]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:21:28.691 --> 01:21:32.572]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:21:32.632 --> 01:21:34.513]  The water level is always visible.
[01:21:34.713 --> 01:21:40.657]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:21:40.878 --> 01:21:45.141]  Get the Berkey Light, a transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:21:54.995 --> 01:21:57.376]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:57.856 --> 01:22:04.639]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:12.723]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, V.I.
[01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:13.423]  Lenin, on them.
[01:22:14.293 --> 01:22:18.996]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[01:22:19.597 --> 01:22:23.599]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[01:22:24.219 --> 01:22:31.964]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[01:22:39.729 --> 01:22:42.372]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:44.654 --> 01:22:46.276]  Call now.
[01:22:46.456 --> 01:22:52.001]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:52.021 --> 01:23:02.091]  Dr. Rima Lebo.
[01:23:04.537 --> 01:23:07.638]  She joins us with her husband, Albert M. Stubblebine.
[01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:15.059]  Albert M. Stubblebine III ran some of the most highly classified U.S.
[01:23:15.099 --> 01:23:17.999]  government programs that we've seen in modern history.
[01:23:18.219 --> 01:23:20.120]  We're talking about Codex Alimentarius.
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:24.401]  Please continue, Doctor, and pop in any time, General, you want to add something.
[01:23:24.921 --> 01:23:25.181]  Got it.
[01:23:25.641 --> 01:23:26.841]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[01:23:27.481 --> 01:23:31.882]  So, we were saying that the Codex Alimentarius Commission was founded
[01:23:32.461 --> 01:23:39.907]  in 1963 and well in 62 and began work in 63 and it was pretty irrelevant.
[01:23:40.247 --> 01:23:50.334]  Nobody was paying any attention to it because everything that it was setting up all the standards guidelines and regulations were voluntary and therefore irrelevant until 1994.
[01:23:51.595 --> 01:23:54.798]  That's the year when Codex acquired teeth.
[01:23:55.218 --> 01:24:01.763]  The teeth are the trade sanctions that the World Trade Organization can impose if a country is found
[01:24:02.199 --> 01:24:02.479]  I think?
[01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:29.495]  The standard that turns out to be immensely important to your survival and to the survival of your children and loved ones.
[01:24:30.035 --> 01:24:50.110]  So Codex was accepted as a standard for the dispute resolution process around food by the World Trade Organization and at that point Codex became relevant and Codex noticed how relevant it became and started telling countries around the world that in order to protect themselves
[01:24:50.498 --> 01:25:15.400]  from the World Trade Organization sanctions, which are so big that they can sell the economy of even the biggest country, let alone the vulnerable economies of countries like Ethiopia and Peru, that they had to adopt the Codex standards not only for international trade, which is what Codex governs, but also for their own domestic
[01:25:16.192 --> 01:25:16.633]  Laws.
[01:25:16.813 --> 01:25:33.354]  In other words, every country in the world has been told that because Codex is a good thing, because it prevents World Trade Organization sanctions from being imposed, and because it is science-based, remember that phrase, science-based,
[01:25:34.497 --> 01:25:40.081]  Every country in the world needs to adopt all of the Codex Regulation standards and guidelines.
[01:25:40.221 --> 01:25:59.116]  And Doctor, let me just go back for a second because every few months I see an article where the US or England or Japan is sanctioned a billion, five billion dollars or more in some cases over the smallest quote trade infraction and the World Trade Organization admittedly and now has more authority over our trade than Congress.
[01:25:59.576 --> 01:26:01.378]  Exactly and so if
[01:26:01.958 --> 01:26:08.301]  Every country in the world fears those billion, two billion, five billion, half a billion trade sanctions.
[01:26:08.661 --> 01:26:14.264]  They're going to run to protect their economies and let the devil take behind her most.
[01:26:14.684 --> 01:26:28.651]  Well, it turns out that since 1994, every single Codex decision, and I want to tell you that there are standards on the production of frog legs, apricot preserves,
[01:26:30.214 --> 01:26:39.799]  Meat, meat products, sardines, milk, everything that can legally go into your mouth, dietary supplements included, but drugs excluded.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.182]  Codex governs everything that can legally go into your mouth with the exception of drugs.
[01:26:45.782 --> 01:26:58.449]  Since then, every single one of the standards, guidelines, and regulations promulgated by Codex that I have read, and I have read thousands upon thousands upon thousands of pages of this
[01:26:59.042 --> 01:27:05.929]  This horror before my husband and I closed our practice of natural medicine in order to take this on.
[01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:13.356]  Every single one of those decisions has been based on what is good for the five bigs.
[01:27:13.576 --> 01:27:19.281]  Big Pharma, Big Biotechna, Big Chema, Big Agribiz, and Big Medica.
[01:27:19.582 --> 01:27:20.943]  They are not based on health.
[01:27:21.143 --> 01:27:23.285]  They are not based on consumer protection.
[01:27:23.425 --> 01:27:24.206]  For instance,
[01:27:24.659 --> 01:27:29.423]  Codex has already determined that all food must be irradiated.
[01:27:30.103 --> 01:27:34.366]  All animals used for the production of food must be treated with antibiotics.
[01:27:34.626 --> 01:27:39.230]  All animals used for the production of food must be treated with growth hormones.
[01:27:39.330 --> 01:27:40.551]  And must be tagged, too.
[01:27:40.591 --> 01:27:42.652]  This is all part of phasing out the small farms.
[01:27:42.672 --> 01:27:43.313]  Must be tagged.
[01:27:43.533 --> 01:27:46.655]  And the next thing that happens, of course, is that people get tagged.
[01:27:48.217 --> 01:27:51.639]  Organic standards have been horribly degraded.
[01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:52.740]  Horribly degraded.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.961]  And since the food has to be
[01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:55.492]  Thank you.
[01:28:12.142 --> 01:28:15.405]  They think that it only pertains to vitamins and mineral supplements.
[01:28:15.505 --> 01:28:16.966]  That's absolutely untrue.
[01:28:17.026 --> 01:28:18.968]  It's a total control grid, as the U.N.
[01:28:18.988 --> 01:28:20.989]  has said, at the World U.N.
[01:28:21.009 --> 01:28:23.191]  Food Summit they had in Beijing in 1996.
[01:28:23.551 --> 01:28:25.092]  They will use food as a weapon.
[01:28:26.093 --> 01:28:27.354]  Exactly.
[01:28:27.374 --> 01:28:28.335]  Well, we've got to break, doctor.
[01:28:28.375 --> 01:28:28.695]  Stay there.
[01:28:28.735 --> 01:28:32.078]  This is riveting information right on target from my research.
[01:28:32.118 --> 01:28:35.601]  We'll get General Stubblebine's comments on this as well and a lot more.
[01:28:35.921 --> 01:28:37.743]  And your calls are coming up after this quick break.
[01:28:37.783 --> 01:28:38.723]  Long segment coming up.
[01:28:39.164 --> 01:28:40.605]  Plenty of time to cover the information.
[01:28:44.477 --> 01:28:45.377]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.878 --> 01:28:47.478]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.419 --> 01:28:51.180]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.241 --> 01:28:57.922]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:28:58.502 --> 01:29:00.243]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:29:01.434 --> 01:29:09.324]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:29:09.545 --> 01:29:12.188]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lay's Med Inc.'
[01:29:12.168 --> 01:29:13.590]  's patented methodology.

[01:29:17.495 --> 01:29:21.880]  We can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.962]  Star Wars technology at its best.

[01:30:11.456 --> 01:30:22.803]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.383 --> 01:30:30.231]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.631 --> 01:30:32.773]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:33.254 --> 01:30:38.219]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.519 --> 01:30:45.284]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.484 --> 01:30:49.106]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.326 --> 01:30:50.067]  That's toll free.
[01:30:50.087 --> 01:30:50.127]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.762 --> 01:30:55.583]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:55.803 --> 01:31:00.985]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:31:01.305 --> 01:31:02.786]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:02.906 --> 01:31:04.886]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:05.147 --> 01:31:10.669]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:10.969 --> 01:31:17.232]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:17.552 --> 01:31:19.773]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:20.073 --> 01:31:22.934]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[01:31:23.434 --> 01:31:26.877]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:31:27.118 --> 01:31:27.518]  Whoa!
[01:31:27.918 --> 01:31:29.119]  What was that website again?
[01:31:29.199 --> 01:31:32.683]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:33.003 --> 01:31:34.104]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:34.244 --> 01:31:38.548]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:38.688 --> 01:31:39.289]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:39.549 --> 01:31:40.750]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:41.791]  Check, please!
[01:31:43.548 --> 01:31:45.028]  Uh, you got this one right, Bill.
[01:31:45.529 --> 01:31:46.109]  Sure, John.
[01:31:46.329 --> 01:31:50.670]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:52.670]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:52.871 --> 01:31:53.131]  Deal.
[01:32:07.515 --> 01:32:13.023]  Ron in New York, Bobby in California, Chad in Texas, Jamie in Kentucky, Matt in New York, many others.
[01:32:14.225 --> 01:32:15.366]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:32:15.386 --> 01:32:19.993]  We'll get to a few before this segment ends and I hope to keep our guests into the next hour because there's so much to talk about.
[01:32:21.639 --> 01:32:24.442]  Albert N. Stubblebine III, Major General, U.S.
[01:32:24.502 --> 01:32:25.844]  Army, retired.
[01:32:26.204 --> 01:32:27.665]  We could talk to him for 10 hours.
[01:32:27.705 --> 01:32:28.246]  There's so much.
[01:32:28.286 --> 01:32:36.454]  And his wife, incredibly informed, with a special view into all this, is a medical doctor who's dealt with this.
[01:32:37.055 --> 01:32:41.820]  And she's, of course, joining us right now, Reema Labow.
[01:32:43.301 --> 01:32:54.526]  So, Doctor and General, please continue with the information that you were just discussing getting in to the Codex Alimentarius and what it controls and how it's now being basically put into force.
[01:32:55.647 --> 01:33:02.990]  Well, Alex, you said that the Beijing Conference, UN Conference, said that food would be used as a weapon.
[01:33:03.130 --> 01:33:03.571]  No, no, no.
[01:33:03.631 --> 01:33:05.692]  Food is being used as a weapon.
[01:33:06.052 --> 01:33:10.674]  Healthy people can think and have the energy and vitality to raise their voices
[01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:14.436]  And if necessary, their fists and say, no, I don't think so.
[01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:25.568]  People who are not fluoridated into willing compliance can say, no, I don't think so, and take the necessary steps to enforce that.
[01:33:26.044 --> 01:33:26.965]  Dr. Lebo, I've got to stop you.
[01:33:27.025 --> 01:33:30.029]  Again, I hate to bring up a book that was written about you, but
[01:33:42.282 --> 01:33:48.725]  By the time you're done reading it, it's like you guys are these evil New World Order occultists running around with long vampire teeth.
[01:33:49.245 --> 01:33:51.686]  But then in reality, you guys sound just like myself.
[01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:53.086]  You know all about what's going on.
[01:33:53.106 --> 01:33:54.067]  You know about the fluoride.
[01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:55.147]  I've read some of your writings.
[01:33:55.447 --> 01:33:57.888]  You're totally up to speed, cutting edge on everything.
[01:33:58.348 --> 01:34:00.409]  No wonder you guys got a hit piece written on you.
[01:34:00.469 --> 01:34:01.669]  It's really refreshing.
[01:34:01.730 --> 01:34:04.330]  General, can you jump in for a second before the doctor continues?
[01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:07.772]  General Stubblebine, and please give us your views on Codex.
[01:34:08.252 --> 01:34:10.693]  The answer is yes, I can jump in.
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:22.126]  First and foremost, and I think one of the critical pieces that everybody's got to understand is, because everybody asks, well, why haven't I seen this on the major media?
[01:34:22.186 --> 01:34:23.367]  Why isn't it on television?
[01:34:23.427 --> 01:34:28.449]  The answer is, very deliberately, it has been kept underneath the radar screen.
[01:34:28.469 --> 01:34:35.813]  Well, it's like NSA spying has been going on for 50 years, and the stuff we're hearing about today has been going on for 20, and people are just now shocked to hear about it.
[01:34:36.174 --> 01:34:39.235]  Yeah, and it's being kept very, very
[01:34:41.129 --> 01:34:42.070]  Close to the chest.
[01:34:42.630 --> 01:34:53.899]  And so no one believes, when you start talking about it, no one believes that it's true because they haven't seen it on their television set or they haven't seen it in a headline in a paper anywhere.
[01:34:54.392 --> 01:34:58.556]  The answer is they haven't seen it because it's deliberately been kept out of there.
[01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:32.282]  And suddenly, Bert and I are, and this is what has been said over and over about us by folks who don't want our message out there, we're CIA agents, we're agents of the Rockefellers, we're witches, we're druids, we're this, we're that, we're terrible, terrible people.
[01:35:32.322 --> 01:35:38.284]  Well, I'll tell you what, we're the controlled opposition, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:35:38.504 --> 01:35:39.905]  The fact is, we're right.
[01:35:40.450 --> 01:35:41.971]  And that's what makes us dangerous.
[01:35:42.051 --> 01:35:49.938]  And when you're right, and you're dangerous, then you have to be neutralized through propaganda, spin, lies, and so on.
[01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:55.103]  Well, Dr. Labo, I mean, I agree with you, but let me just add something else to this.
[01:35:55.123 --> 01:35:56.164]  You brought up fluoridation.
[01:35:56.204 --> 01:35:59.607]  It was Edward L. Bernays who convinced women to smoke cigarettes.
[01:35:59.647 --> 01:36:01.689]  He made bacon popular on the breakfast table.
[01:36:02.009 --> 01:36:02.970]  He worked for the Pentagon.
[01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:04.131]  He worked for three presidents.
[01:36:04.871 --> 01:36:09.875]  He's the guy who engineered the PR to get the sodium and stannous fluoride in the water.
[01:36:10.336 --> 01:36:13.979]  Now even head doctors and governments are banning it.
[01:36:14.239 --> 01:36:22.146]  Since you brought that up, give us, as a medical doctor, your take and your view, and then of course you as well, General, on the fluoridation of the water.
[01:36:22.746 --> 01:36:33.555]  Fluoridation, as I assume your listeners know well from your work, Alex, was introduced into the Soviet gulags because it made prisoners compliant.
[01:36:34.016 --> 01:36:41.560]  It was introduced into the water supply of the Nazi concentration camps because it made prisoners compliant.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.441]  And that's even in mainstream history books.
[01:36:44.842 --> 01:36:45.462]  Absolutely.
[01:36:45.522 --> 01:36:49.224]  This is not fought over and questioned.
[01:36:49.504 --> 01:37:03.131]  Fluoridation was introduced into the United States water supply through junk science, the same kind of junk science that Codex relies upon to convince countries to do terrible things to their population's health.
[01:37:03.869 --> 01:37:08.512]  In order to, the fluoride was introduced in order to do two things.
[01:37:08.693 --> 01:37:24.484]  One was provide a very economical disposal system for wildly toxic fluoride salts, which would otherwise be very expensive to dispose of in line with the OSHA requirements for toxic disposal.
[01:37:24.864 --> 01:37:26.445]  And two, to provide
[01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:28.223]  Thank you.
[01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:49.369]  You have something that you can do about it?
[01:37:49.429 --> 01:37:55.771]  Well, Nobel Prize winners, medical doctors have gone public and said it causes all sorts of serious health problems.
[01:37:55.831 --> 01:38:00.993]  I go to the, you know, Baby's USA store and it's fluoride for your children, fluoridated water.
[01:38:01.073 --> 01:38:02.074]  Give this to your children.
[01:38:02.274 --> 01:38:04.995]  Your child needs this type of fluoride.
[01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:12.378]  We've gone from the smartest country, most educated and richest country, to now major studies show over two-thirds of young people, 18 to 24,
[01:38:13.758 --> 01:38:17.221]  And in some cases even higher than that, can't find Iraq, can't find India.
[01:38:17.501 --> 01:38:19.563]  We've gone from being the smartest to the dumbest.
[01:38:19.903 --> 01:38:25.148]  Doctor, do you believe that's directly linked, not just to the educational standards, but also to the fluoridation?
[01:38:25.608 --> 01:38:41.922]  I believe it's partly the fluoridation, it's partly the wild, insane drugging of our children with deadly and neurologically damaging, permanently neurologically damaging drugs for make-believe diagnosis.
[01:38:42.398 --> 01:38:52.043]  It's partly due to the hydrogenated fats which make the cell membranes of the nervous system rigid instead of flexible so your brain doesn't work.
[01:38:52.983 --> 01:38:59.706]  It's due to the degraded food supply with artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives which are all toxins.
[01:38:59.806 --> 01:39:04.889]  It's due in large measure to the neurotoxic effects of the pesticides
[01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:09.551]  Let me add something, Alex, because we're talking in terms of deliberately doing this.
[01:39:09.591 --> 01:39:10.951]  Let me give you a quote from Mao Zedong.
[01:39:10.971 --> 01:39:12.371]  Everybody knows who Mao was.
[01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.050]  Demands deception.
[01:39:37.851 --> 01:39:55.805]  It is often possible by adopting all kinds of measures of deception, listen to that, deception, to drive the enemy into the plight of making erroneous judgments and taking erroneous actions, thus depriving him of his superiority and initiative.
[01:39:55.846 --> 01:39:58.247]  Now that comes out of the mouth of Mao Zedong.
[01:39:59.609 --> 01:40:02.411]  And there is a war against health.
[01:40:02.992 --> 01:40:05.253]  Just as there is a war against our children.
[01:40:05.313 --> 01:40:06.774]  It involves vaccination.
[01:40:07.175 --> 01:40:09.316]  It involves degraded food.
[01:40:09.476 --> 01:40:13.398]  It involves many, many, many aspects, including fluoridation.
[01:40:13.558 --> 01:40:16.120]  Unfortunately, it's not a war on a single front.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.762]  Dr. Lebeau, can you give us the websites for your organizations?
[01:40:20.803 --> 01:40:21.443]  With pleasure.
[01:40:21.843 --> 01:40:31.709]  First of all, the information on Codex and the steps that you need to take, which I'd like to talk about, because we have power and we've just gained a significant beachhead.
[01:40:32.179 --> 01:40:33.760]  in Codex and we need your help.
[01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:51.048]  The first site is www.healthfreedomusa.org www.healthfreedomusa.org and you will find there something that says sign petition.
[01:40:51.428 --> 01:40:55.430]  This is a legal assault on the United States Codex position.
[01:40:55.770 --> 01:40:57.791]  Please join the citizens petition.
[01:40:58.111 --> 01:40:58.872]  You'll find there
[01:41:01.277 --> 01:41:01.817]  DVD.
[01:41:02.378 --> 01:41:02.818]  Buy it.
[01:41:03.158 --> 01:41:03.618]  Watch it.
[01:41:03.978 --> 01:41:05.039]  Show it to your friends.
[01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:06.219]  You'll find the e-book.
[01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:07.480]  Send it to your congressman.
[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:08.861]  Send it to your congressman.
[01:41:09.121 --> 01:41:10.661]  You'll find the Codex e-book.
[01:41:10.701 --> 01:41:25.769]  That's the same document that General Stubblebine and I presented to Ministers of Health and Chairman of National Codex Committees during our month-long trip to Africa earlier this year in which we said to them, you do not have to stand by and watch your people die.
[01:41:26.129 --> 01:41:27.009]  You have a choice.
[01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:28.890]  Codex is not inevitable.
[01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:30.451]  Codex does not
[01:41:32.166 --> 01:41:37.930]  Well, the good news is, and again we have links to your websites, both of them, up on InfoWars.com.
[01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:43.854]  Right now, they're in the guest section on the main page, so anybody that misses those can go to InfoWars.com.
[01:41:43.974 --> 01:41:46.236]  And when the General says, and when you say, Doctor,
[01:41:46.616 --> 01:41:47.617]  This is premeditated.
[01:41:47.917 --> 01:41:49.398]  We have their own documents.
[01:41:49.438 --> 01:41:50.879]  We have their own battle plan.
[01:41:51.179 --> 01:41:52.500]  And you're right, it's not coming.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:55.082]  They're using food as a weapon.
[01:41:55.403 --> 01:41:57.304]  This has been done by design.
[01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:59.566]  You can see the health effects in our society.
[01:41:59.886 --> 01:42:02.508]  Diabetes skyrocketing several thousand percent.
[01:42:02.568 --> 01:42:05.610]  Every other type of disease and illness exploding.
[01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:07.051]  It is an epidemic.
[01:42:07.111 --> 01:42:08.532]  It is a pan-demic.
[01:42:08.973 --> 01:42:14.817]  What is their final goal if they're able to implement Codex here domestically, general and doctor?
[01:42:15.808 --> 01:42:16.268]  I don't know.
[01:42:17.429 --> 01:42:22.031]  You see, I make a strong distinction, Alex, between what I know and what I believe.
[01:42:22.231 --> 01:42:27.754]  And nobody invited me to their secret deliberations and said... So what do you believe?
[01:42:27.794 --> 01:42:28.334]  What do you believe?
[01:42:28.474 --> 01:42:31.956]  What I believe is that sick people are profitable.
[01:42:32.636 --> 01:42:33.596]  Let's start with that.
[01:42:33.957 --> 01:42:38.819]  Healthy people are bad customers for the pharmaceutical industry and for the medical industry.
[01:42:39.992 --> 01:42:41.053]  So we start with that.
[01:42:41.513 --> 01:42:58.022]  Then we come to what the World Health Organization, a former chairperson, and what many people in the high echelons of world organizations that control the economies of the planet have said.
[01:42:58.923 --> 01:43:02.605]  And that includes the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank,
[01:43:02.967 --> 01:43:03.908]  Well, we know that's their intent!
[01:43:21.758 --> 01:43:23.398]  Let me just add one thing.
[01:43:23.418 --> 01:43:30.862]  Did you hear about Professor Pianca at UT who said that we need to reduce 90% and needs to start now?
[01:43:31.262 --> 01:43:34.423]  And a lot of other professors said no, we need all humans to die.
[01:43:34.744 --> 01:43:36.665]  General, a doctor, can both of you comment on that?
[01:43:37.285 --> 01:43:40.286]  Well, I want to start on that Alex.
[01:43:40.927 --> 01:43:43.848]  I'm a psychiatrist and I know crazy when I see it.
[01:43:44.966 --> 01:43:45.986]  That's what we're looking at.
[01:43:46.267 --> 01:43:48.027]  Profound craziness.
[01:43:48.227 --> 01:43:55.970]  When we watched him on MSNBC, that's what the whole staff here at the office on a big screen TV, we were watching him and we said, that guy is completely loon.
[01:43:56.250 --> 01:44:00.392]  If I saw him in downtown Austin, I would have thought he got out of the Texas State Hospital.
[01:44:02.588 --> 01:44:03.609]  Indeed, indeed.
[01:44:03.889 --> 01:44:12.656]  Now, you know, the fact that somebody's on TV, the fact that somebody has a professor, a professorial appointment, or a political office doesn't mean that they're not crazy.
[01:44:12.696 --> 01:44:15.498]  We have far too much confirmation of that sad fact.
[01:44:15.939 --> 01:44:20.783]  This is profoundly crazy, but I will tell you that
[01:44:21.972 --> 01:44:31.461]  The route that we're heading with Codex, with the over-medication, and you know pharmaceutical medications are the leading cause of death in this country.
[01:44:31.481 --> 01:44:31.662]  Yes.
[01:44:32.602 --> 01:44:45.215]  With the toxification of our environment and the toxification of everything we put into our mouth unless it's organic, and the degradation of the organic standards, if you're not very careful you become part of
[01:44:45.726 --> 01:44:48.047]  The herd that's on the route to extinction.
[01:44:48.067 --> 01:44:58.689]  Well, Doctor, I agree, but the key point here is that Dr. Pianka and Dr. Singer and others are supported by the highest levels of academia and government research and are seen as heroes.
[01:44:58.749 --> 01:45:08.231]  So even though their poster boys are lunatics whose eyes literally roll around their head on national TV, it still shows that the establishment is firmly behind this.
[01:45:08.551 --> 01:45:09.932]  General, can I get a comment on you?
[01:45:09.952 --> 01:45:11.052]  Yeah.
[01:45:11.272 --> 01:45:13.813]  Let me turn that thing upside down, Alex.
[01:45:15.792 --> 01:45:20.153]  I like to look at things, the glass half-full, not half-empty.
[01:45:21.153 --> 01:45:23.033]  And I have no intention of dying.
[01:45:23.533 --> 01:45:23.933]  Period.
[01:45:24.694 --> 01:45:44.277]  And, I believe that we've set out a strategy that allows us to move and, oh by the way, it's based on the principles of war which come out of Sun Tzu way back in the 3rd or 4th century BC, we're not quite sure when, but we have set out a strategy
[01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:46.701]  It's based on principles of war.
[01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:49.605]  They're used in any time you go to war.
[01:45:50.646 --> 01:45:57.596]  And we intend, A, not to die, and B, not to let anybody else die.
[01:45:58.365 --> 01:46:05.067]  So, that's where we're headed, and we have a strategy, I believe, that can achieve those goals.
[01:46:05.227 --> 01:46:08.308]  General, you just came to the point I wanted to get to later.
[01:46:08.788 --> 01:46:16.131]  The elite openly say, and Joy, the owner of Sun Microsystems, co-chair, has been at these meetings and wrote about it, warning people,
[01:46:16.571 --> 01:46:30.941]  That the elite know they have life extension technologies, but they don't want to give it to six and a half billion people, and they admit currently to extend life if you start early to 150, 200 years old, if there hasn't been too much cellular damage, and they don't want the general public to have it.
[01:46:31.001 --> 01:46:39.267]  That's why they want to create a world government, then exterminate 80 to 95 percent of us, and then only give the small few the life extension system.
[01:46:39.307 --> 01:46:42.269]  So I don't know if with the current technologies it can be put out
[01:46:42.549 --> 01:46:44.289]  I don't know, but I have no intention of going for at least another 150.
[01:46:44.329 --> 01:46:46.830]  Because I'm not finished doing everything I need to do here on this planet. 76.
[01:47:08.929 --> 01:47:11.430]  That's because of what I do for them.
[01:47:11.610 --> 01:47:12.751]  That's exactly right.
[01:47:13.551 --> 01:47:24.997]  And what I do for them starts with clean, unadulterated food, and it starts with high-potency nutrients and supplements, and it starts with the sensible things that need to be done.
[01:47:25.377 --> 01:47:33.141]  Just very quickly, in 1994, the General developed what was supposed to be terminal cancer, and I said, I don't think so.
[01:47:33.522 --> 01:47:38.244]  And we did the sensible, natural things that everybody has accessible to them,
[01:47:38.783 --> 01:47:42.805]  And lo and behold, rather than terminal cancer, he's got terminal health.
[01:47:44.246 --> 01:47:45.247]  Doctor, let me stop you again.
[01:47:45.287 --> 01:47:46.668]  I've got to keep adding points here.
[01:47:47.148 --> 01:48:02.437]  Four years ago, the head of Monsanto said, this was even in National Geographic, that they want to infect all the seed crops with their genetic-engineered system so then people don't have a choice and quote, have to eat genetic-engineered cross-species creations.
[01:48:03.137 --> 01:48:07.340]  Monsanto said that by 2020 they will control all food worldwide.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:30.650]  One of the things that we have done, the Natural Solutions Foundation, and we'd like you to join us, and by the way this is an expensive battle, one of the things that we've done is we've taken this information to Africa and we will be going back to Africa to meet with the Ministers of Health and the Codex Committee people and the consumer advocates and then we will be going to
[01:48:31.190 --> 01:48:36.112]  India, to China, to Thailand, to Cambodia, to Laos, and so on.
[01:48:36.432 --> 01:48:40.754]  Telling them what the government level people are not telling them.
[01:48:40.774 --> 01:48:42.475]  By the way, what does Africa know?
[01:48:42.835 --> 01:48:45.916]  Doctor, what does Africa in general, what do they know that we don't know?
[01:48:45.996 --> 01:48:50.498]  Even when they're starving to death, they will let GMO food rot at the docks.
[01:48:50.558 --> 01:48:51.398]  They will not eat it.
[01:48:52.139 --> 01:48:54.700]  You know, Robert Mugabe is not anybody's
[01:48:56.042 --> 01:49:01.645]  favorite champion of democracy and personal freedom, as our press tells us often.
[01:49:02.005 --> 01:49:21.975]  But Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe opened the World Health Organization, UN Food and Agriculture Organization, IMS World Bank meeting in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, which Bert and I visited last January, by saying
[01:49:24.731 --> 01:49:33.242]  You people from the developed countries and from the international organizations are trying to kill Africa with genetically modified foods.
[01:49:33.342 --> 01:49:38.048]  Now Robert Mugabe seems to get a lot wrong from my point of view, but he got that one right.
[01:49:38.419 --> 01:49:39.560]  And that is the game.
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:50.464]  So the people of Africa know that this is what's in store for them, and they welcomed us once they were convinced that we weren't selling anything and didn't want to be high-priced consultants.
[01:49:50.504 --> 01:49:52.105]  We've got to go to break.
[01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:53.666]  We'll be right back in three minutes.
[01:49:53.706 --> 01:49:54.086]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.166 --> 01:50:00.629]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.309 --> 01:50:02.030]  That's right, folks.
[01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:02.690]  DVD.
[01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:05.111]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.252 --> 01:50:07.333]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.613 --> 01:50:12.556]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.876 --> 01:50:16.919]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:17.179 --> 01:50:18.940]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:29.665]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.805 --> 01:50:31.706]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.906 --> 01:50:35.788]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.

[01:50:57.930 --> 01:51:03.351]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.631 --> 01:51:13.994]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.154 --> 01:51:18.495]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.615 --> 01:51:19.495]  We're good to go!
[01:51:33.803 --> 01:51:38.267]  Yep, the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[01:51:55.307 --> 01:51:55.787]  Thank you.
[01:52:10.612 --> 01:52:11.273]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.131 --> 01:52:43.234]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.394 --> 01:52:49.359]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.383 --> 01:52:59.928]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.406 --> 01:53:03.747]  We're going to have a caller free-for-all.
[01:53:03.767 --> 01:53:08.130]  We're going to get into remote viewing that General Stubblebine brought into the Army.
[01:53:08.851 --> 01:53:12.994]  This guy had run basically everything in the Army at every level throughout his career.
[01:53:13.995 --> 01:53:21.400]  And, you know, to have him on here talking about fluoridation, toxic foods, genetic engineering, and then life extension technologies.
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:28.446]  I know for a fact that Bill Joy and others have written about how they go to elite meetings and the elites say, this is in Wired Magazine, people.
[01:53:29.046 --> 01:53:30.748]  That we can't have access to it.
[01:53:30.788 --> 01:53:33.730]  They're going to use a control grid to get rid of us so they get to have it.
[01:53:34.090 --> 01:53:36.032]  So they are the progenitors of the future.
[01:53:36.612 --> 01:53:39.255]  And they try to seize control of human destiny.
[01:53:40.095 --> 01:53:45.900]  And I don't know how far the life extension can go, but I know that there are advanced technologies being suppressed.
[01:53:46.661 --> 01:53:48.362]  And I know it's very, very serious.
[01:53:49.083 --> 01:53:50.884]  And it's interesting to have our guest with us.
[01:53:51.304 --> 01:53:51.865]  It's riveting.
[01:53:51.885 --> 01:53:53.866]  Interesting isn't enough of a comment.
[01:53:54.307 --> 01:53:55.508]  But we're going to go to Bobby and
[01:53:57.038 --> 01:53:59.520]  Jamie and Matt here because they specifically want to talk to our guest.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:02.521]  And Ron and Chad and others can be part of the free-for-all later.
[01:54:02.541 --> 01:54:04.622]  We're going to get more into Codex in the next hour.
[01:54:04.642 --> 01:54:12.687]  We're going to get into some of the General's other activities at the Pentagon and heading up whole military operations of the highest security.
[01:54:13.688 --> 01:54:14.588]  Pretty wild stuff.
[01:54:14.608 --> 01:54:16.889]  But right now, let's go to Bobby in California.
[01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:19.131]  Bobby, you're on with the Doctor and the General.
[01:54:19.171 --> 01:54:19.771]  Go ahead, Bobby.
[01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:32.713]  Hi, I wanted to talk to the doctor about if there were about hemp seed being like the most complete food that there is and do you know, yeah, just about hemp seed?
[01:54:34.413 --> 01:54:46.176]  I know a lot about hemp seed and I think hemp is a great food as long as it's not heated and the oil that's pressed from it is not degraded through the production techniques.
[01:54:47.096 --> 01:54:48.437]  Hemp is a terrific food.
[01:54:49.864 --> 01:54:55.433]  And so it's very, very important to make it, among other terrific foods available.
[01:54:55.753 --> 01:55:00.640]  And of course, the propaganda against it is pretty ferocious.
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.645]  So yes, I do know about hemp seed, and I think it's great stuff.
[01:55:04.321 --> 01:55:10.185]  Yes, it's actually the, yeah, it survived like a DEA ruling against it a couple years ago.
[01:55:10.205 --> 01:55:15.870]  And it's actually the closest to fish oil that there is in the plant kingdom.
[01:55:16.230 --> 01:55:17.691]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[01:55:18.512 --> 01:55:21.054]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jamie in Kentucky.
[01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:21.954]  Jamie, go ahead.
[01:55:22.495 --> 01:55:25.577]  Yes, my question is for the doctor.
[01:55:27.398 --> 01:55:30.761]  Yes, I would like to know, are there any, like, cures
[01:55:31.844 --> 01:55:34.425]  Any known cures for cancer?
[01:55:35.385 --> 01:55:38.545]  Oh, there are many, many, many known cures for cancer.
[01:55:38.925 --> 01:55:40.306]  It just depends whom you ask.
[01:55:40.766 --> 01:55:44.086]  What about Laetrile?
[01:55:44.266 --> 01:55:49.447]  Laetrile, or what's sometimes called Vitamin B17, has many uses.
[01:55:49.527 --> 01:55:56.709]  There are people for whom Laetrile is the answer for regaining health, and there are people for whom Laetrile is not the answer.
[01:55:57.911 --> 01:55:59.412]  Thank you, Jamie.
[01:55:59.873 --> 01:56:03.156]  I mean, isn't it a cocktail of things that you need?
[01:56:04.276 --> 01:56:07.379]  Well, cancer is not a disease of an organ.
[01:56:07.479 --> 01:56:09.621]  Cancer is a disease of the immune system.
[01:56:09.681 --> 01:56:11.082]  It's about immune failure.
[01:56:11.382 --> 01:56:22.812]  And if you just try to suppress the cancer without building up the immune system so that it could do what it was supposed to do in the first place, which is surveil the development of cancer cells and destroy those cancer cells,
[01:56:23.206 --> 01:56:27.628]  Then you really haven't done anything except stave the problem off for a little while.
[01:56:27.868 --> 01:56:29.329]  Now I know you do the natural route.
[01:56:29.349 --> 01:56:32.190]  What about every month there's a new cure and then it gets shelved?
[01:56:32.590 --> 01:56:40.454]  Like the final scene of Indiana Jones and the Raiders of Lost Ark, that warehouse full of secrets, but you know they take the blood from healthy mice
[01:56:40.814 --> 01:56:41.835]  That's a good question.
[01:57:00.605 --> 01:57:03.246]  And doing what it needs to do in the first place.
[01:57:03.626 --> 01:57:05.926]  Well, that seems to me the best route to go.
[01:57:05.986 --> 01:57:08.427]  But as I say, it's not a do-it-yourself activity.
[01:57:08.747 --> 01:57:11.828]  So I suggest you contact doctors who know about this.
[01:57:12.428 --> 01:57:19.029]  And the best site for that is www.aaem.com.
[01:57:19.549 --> 01:57:21.690]  A-A-E-M.
[01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:22.690]  A-A-E-M.
[01:57:23.210 --> 01:57:26.311]  We'll be right back with the doctor and with the general.
[01:57:26.671 --> 01:57:27.871]  You'll want to stay with us.
[01:57:28.778 --> 01:57:31.999]  There's so much more we'll be discussing in the third hour and your calls as well.
[01:57:33.779 --> 01:57:38.640]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.120]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.040]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.261 --> 01:57:45.962]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:46.382 --> 01:57:48.902]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.926 --> 01:57:57.787]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.807 --> 01:58:02.431]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.671 --> 01:58:06.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.278 --> 01:58:13.961]  Dr. Rima Lebeau is our guest.
[01:58:15.062 --> 01:58:20.366]  And of course, we're joined by her husband, Albert N. Stubblebine III, Major General, U.S.
[01:58:20.446 --> 01:58:21.267]  Army, retired.
[01:58:22.091 --> 01:58:25.174]  We've worked at so many levels of the military.
[01:58:25.235 --> 01:58:29.359]  I've got a lot of fascinating information we'll be talking about in this hour.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:33.824]  I want to go ahead and cycle through some more of the calls in this little five-minute segment.
[01:58:33.844 --> 01:58:43.014]  Then we'll come back in the next long segment and get more into Codex Alimentarius that will control the food, restrict it all, force us to basically eat all these poisons.
[01:58:43.954 --> 01:58:44.774]  All these toxins.
[01:58:45.355 --> 01:58:47.335]  We're talking about a lot of really serious issues today.
[01:58:47.375 --> 01:58:52.578]  We'll also get into remote viewing that, of course, General Stubblebine pioneered in the military.
[01:58:52.978 --> 01:58:54.879]  And again, I'm not really an expert on this, folks.
[01:58:55.039 --> 01:58:56.879]  I'm not saying it's real or it isn't real.
[01:58:56.919 --> 01:58:57.520]  He says it is.
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:07.704]  The point is, he's a highly respected person with a lot of letters behind his name out here talking about this and everything else they say I know to be true about the fluoridation of the water and the New World Order and the rest of it.
[01:59:08.424 --> 01:59:09.965]  But continuing, Doctor and General,
[01:59:10.465 --> 01:59:12.947]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in New York.
[01:59:13.447 --> 01:59:14.708]  Matt, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:59:14.729 --> 01:59:15.449]  Hi, how are you?
[01:59:15.829 --> 01:59:16.390]  Good, go ahead.
[01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:17.411]  Uh, General.
[01:59:17.991 --> 01:59:18.211]  Yo!
[01:59:18.832 --> 01:59:19.192]  How are you?
[01:59:20.253 --> 01:59:21.314]  I'm fine, how are you?
[01:59:21.654 --> 01:59:22.475]  I'm doing pretty good.
[01:59:22.875 --> 01:59:26.858]  I have a question about how in-depth you are into the psionics program.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.640]  Go ahead, caller.
[01:59:29.940 --> 01:59:37.386]  The psionics program, how far... were you actually doing the remote viewing yourself, or were you just observing the kids?
[01:59:38.467 --> 01:59:39.328]  No, I was the boss.
[01:59:39.721 --> 01:59:40.601]  You were the boss of it?
[01:59:40.741 --> 01:59:41.361]  I was the boss.
[01:59:41.541 --> 02:00:01.265]  You know, as the head of the Intelligence and Security Command, you know, I essentially had, for the period of time that I was in command, responsibility for all of the actions and responsibilities that the command had.
[02:00:01.765 --> 02:00:08.706]  One of those was responsible for the remote viewing of the Army segment.
[02:00:09.588 --> 02:00:12.069]  And so, essentially, I was the boss man.
[02:00:12.549 --> 02:00:13.749]  Were you a remote viewer?
[02:00:14.869 --> 02:00:15.030]  No.
[02:00:16.610 --> 02:00:18.550]  But... What happened to the remote viewers?
[02:00:18.791 --> 02:00:18.991]  What?
[02:00:19.431 --> 02:00:20.251]  What happened to them?
[02:00:21.451 --> 02:00:21.651]  Yes.
[02:00:22.472 --> 02:00:27.653]  Well, there was a very interesting... Let me give you just a very quick vignette.
[02:00:27.793 --> 02:00:37.676]  There was a television program a number of years ago, and we don't watch television, but at the time it was
[02:00:39.278 --> 02:00:49.523]  I was curious about the ball scores, so I came in, I turned on the television set, thinking I was going to get the ball scores, and instead, I got this program on remote viewing.
[02:00:49.823 --> 02:00:51.003]  With Larry King Live.
[02:00:51.063 --> 02:00:55.085]  General, I actually practice psionics.
[02:00:55.445 --> 02:00:57.046]  Well, sir, he's trying to answer your questions.
[02:00:57.086 --> 02:00:58.687]  Let him answer it, okay?
[02:00:59.187 --> 02:01:07.370]  Yeah, well, the program was an interview of a number of people that I knew who were involved in the program.
[02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:08.671]  There were some new faces.
[02:01:09.284 --> 02:01:16.085]  But the last person that was being interviewed was Gates, the ex-director of CIA.
[02:01:17.346 --> 02:01:20.886]  And the first time around, everything was pretty normal.
[02:01:22.046 --> 02:01:34.149]  But coming around the second time, the second interview for each of them, when it got to Gates, he said, well, we've spent a million dollars a year for ten years on this program, and it's too expensive.
[02:01:35.353 --> 02:01:36.154]  It doesn't work.
[02:01:36.534 --> 02:01:44.158]  It only, grab your seatbelt, I hope you got it fastened, it only is successful 85% of the time.
[02:01:45.979 --> 02:01:46.300]  Only 85%.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:48.361]  Now, I ask you, Matt.
[02:01:48.701 --> 02:01:48.861]  Yes?
[02:01:48.981 --> 02:01:52.764]  Can you get through college with an 85, with a B plus average?
[02:01:54.024 --> 02:01:55.725]  Um, I'm not really into... Can you do that?
[02:01:56.206 --> 02:01:57.707]  No, no, I don't think I could.
[02:01:58.207 --> 02:01:59.968]  Yes, if you get through college with a 70%...
[02:02:03.686 --> 02:02:06.128]  I'm not sure, but I... Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:02:06.749 --> 02:02:07.990]  I really appreciate it.
[02:02:08.010 --> 02:02:10.572]  Yes, the answer is yes, you get through college with a B.S.
[02:02:11.132 --> 02:02:12.213]  I've got to add one more thing.
[02:02:12.854 --> 02:02:21.621]  When I was in Vietnam, as the Intelligence Officer of the 25th Infantry Division, I felt I was lucky if I had 5% information.
[02:02:22.322 --> 02:02:23.162]  And he's talking about 85.
[02:02:23.723 --> 02:02:26.265]  I'd have been in hog heaven with 85%.
[02:02:26.425 --> 02:02:28.707]  Does that answer your question?
[02:02:29.828 --> 02:02:30.549]  It certainly does.
[02:02:30.569 --> 02:02:31.990]  We'll be right back, get back into...
[02:02:47.192 --> 02:02:50.054]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.294 --> 02:02:51.875]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.215 --> 02:02:56.897]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.238 --> 02:03:03.961]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.301 --> 02:03:06.262]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.482 --> 02:03:09.302]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.402 --> 02:03:14.064]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.284 --> 02:03:18.665]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.925 --> 02:03:22.326]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy.
[02:03:22.466 --> 02:03:26.147]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:48.162 --> 02:03:53.906]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:54.166 --> 02:03:59.290]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:08.916]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:04:09.256 --> 02:04:14.259]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:04:14.539 --> 02:04:18.541]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:04:18.741 --> 02:04:23.543]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:04:23.883 --> 02:04:29.846]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[02:04:40.312 --> 02:04:41.393]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.431 --> 02:04:50.014]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:04:50.274 --> 02:04:51.135]  Look no further!
[02:04:51.435 --> 02:04:54.017]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:04:54.438 --> 02:05:02.945]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:05:03.105 --> 02:05:04.306]  You can order everything you need
[02:05:04.386 --> 02:05:04.726]  I think so.
[02:05:20.686 --> 02:05:21.227]  I think so.
[02:05:39.701 --> 02:05:42.443]  You know, I'm not what you call a conspiracy theorist.
[02:05:42.463 --> 02:05:56.792]  I only go off the facts, the things I can prove, but I also try to bring you interesting guests, really intelligent, informed guests who are experts and leaders in their field, and we're certainly doing that today.
[02:06:09.082 --> 02:06:17.945]  But I've got to say, three or four times a year, my ISDN line, it's old technology, we use it because it's dedicated and good for doing remote radio broadcast.
[02:06:18.305 --> 02:06:20.485]  The network's up in Minnesota, Minneapolis-St.
[02:06:20.525 --> 02:06:24.347]  Paul, with the satellite uplinks and the board operators and all the folks.
[02:06:25.227 --> 02:06:34.330]  This only happens when I'm exposing, oh, torture in Iraq with General Janis Karpinski going public about how they tried to set her up for it and how they're carrying it out.
[02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:35.190]  The line cuts out.
[02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:41.632]  Or if I'm talking about Dyncor and the Chicago Tribune and child kidnapping rings, the ISDN line cuts out.
[02:06:41.692 --> 02:06:43.732]  I always know it's really serious when it does that.
[02:06:44.132 --> 02:06:51.614]  And our guests haven't been able to tell it because they've been dialing me on backup ISDN lines, but I've been cutting out during this broadcast, and they've been redialing me.
[02:06:51.634 --> 02:06:54.595]  You just haven't been hearing it because they've been talking on air.
[02:06:54.615 --> 02:06:57.176]  And it just happened going out to break a minute ago.
[02:06:57.696 --> 02:07:00.377]  Only three or four times a year, and it's always guests like this.
[02:07:01.438 --> 02:07:04.421]  General, have you heard of this type of stuff happening before when you're on radio shows?
[02:07:04.761 --> 02:07:06.402]  We must be doing something right, Alex.
[02:07:06.482 --> 02:07:08.043]  Yes, this has happened before.
[02:07:08.724 --> 02:07:15.529]  And it's in a whole wide range of places and different kinds of broadcasts.
[02:07:15.969 --> 02:07:20.933]  Sometimes it's streaming, sometimes it's live transmission.
[02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:21.934]  Yes, indeed.
[02:07:22.394 --> 02:07:23.495]  This has happened before.
[02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:25.417]  And that tells us that we're doing something right.
[02:07:25.657 --> 02:07:26.978]  General, do you have any comments on this?
[02:07:27.705 --> 02:07:28.266]  Same thing.
[02:07:28.446 --> 02:07:31.728]  We're doing something right, because otherwise no one would pay any attention to us.
[02:07:31.968 --> 02:07:43.057]  I'll tell you, our cell phone has begun dialing the people in our address book on its own, which means they're doing, not the people, but whoever's messing with our communication system is doing something wrong.
[02:07:43.117 --> 02:07:43.958]  Get it right, guys.
[02:07:44.617 --> 02:07:47.519]  Well, you've got exactly, they're going to surveil you and get it right.
[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:51.703]  Of course, I remember G. Gordon Letty told me personally one time when I was in an event with him.
[02:07:52.083 --> 02:07:55.366]  He goes, Alex, I bet you come in and pick up your phone and there's nobody there.
[02:07:55.386 --> 02:07:57.488]  He goes, I bet you've heard people talking before.
[02:07:57.828 --> 02:08:00.150]  And he said that's when they're kind of screwing it up.
[02:08:00.190 --> 02:08:02.692]  They can use the phones in your house as a bug.
[02:08:03.232 --> 02:08:07.776]  But at the same time, General, most people I talk to in government are now on our side.
[02:08:07.816 --> 02:08:08.917]  They weren't ten years ago.
[02:08:09.237 --> 02:08:15.442]  Have you seen, General, a major shift towards people in the government, in the military, waking up to what's happening?
[02:08:16.183 --> 02:08:28.353]  Well, certainly there were, I think the number is now six General Officers, all retired, who have decided that it was time to speak up about Iraq.
[02:08:29.245 --> 02:08:32.947]  And I suspect that there will be more following them.
[02:08:33.168 --> 02:08:34.949]  I can't believe that more won't come.
[02:08:35.369 --> 02:08:38.511]  Well, I'm not asking you to put your... I'm sorry, General, go ahead.
[02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:40.232]  They're not going to do it until they retire.
[02:08:40.872 --> 02:08:45.695]  Well, I'm not asking you to get into some big new controversy, but what's your whole view of the Iraq War and what's happening?
[02:08:46.656 --> 02:08:53.020]  Well, let me go back to the principles of war, Alex, because if you're going to go to war,
[02:08:53.877 --> 02:09:01.882]  You must pay attention to the principles, and again, I said earlier that they go back all the way to the 3rd or 4th century B.C.
[02:09:01.902 --> 02:09:04.284]  with a guy named Sun Tzu who wrote The Art of War.
[02:09:05.325 --> 02:09:08.547]  Every military has a set of principles of war.
[02:09:08.567 --> 02:09:13.450]  They vary from country to country, but every military has a principle of war.
[02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:14.391]  It's called doctrine.
[02:09:15.051 --> 02:09:15.491]  Doctrine.
[02:09:15.712 --> 02:09:19.214]  Well, the first principle in the U.S.
[02:09:19.434 --> 02:09:20.575]  is called objective.
[02:09:21.035 --> 02:09:21.355]  Okay?
[02:09:21.916 --> 02:09:22.996]  What is your objective?
[02:09:24.019 --> 02:09:29.522]  Right after 9-11, it was clearly stated that our objective was to get Bin Laden.
[02:09:30.642 --> 02:09:30.942]  Okay?
[02:09:31.323 --> 02:09:32.023]  Get Bin Laden.
[02:09:32.203 --> 02:09:33.704]  He was the culprit.
[02:09:34.104 --> 02:09:37.806]  We needed to get his ass and fling him in jail.
[02:09:38.006 --> 02:09:38.266]  Alright?
[02:09:39.187 --> 02:09:39.947]  Where is Bin Laden?
[02:09:42.308 --> 02:09:43.729]  I just asked the question, where is he?
[02:09:44.569 --> 02:09:48.671]  Most people, most people will tell you it's sort of Afghanistan.
[02:09:50.132 --> 02:09:51.973]  So, what are we doing in Iraq?
[02:09:53.217 --> 02:09:59.522]  If our objective was Bin Laden, he certainly wasn't in Iraq.
[02:10:00.663 --> 02:10:02.505]  So did we start off with the wrong step?
[02:10:05.436 --> 02:10:20.627]  General, the PNAC documents, as you know well, clearly state that Saddam wasn't a threat, but would be used as a pretext to secure the oil and use Iraq as a projection point of power into Iran and Syria.
[02:10:20.968 --> 02:10:24.070]  And now they're doing that in Pentagon documents from 1983, from 2000.
[02:10:24.130 --> 02:10:26.272]  They're now all public.
[02:10:26.492 --> 02:10:30.815]  Israeli documents say they actually want civil war, they want to Balkanize, they want to break
[02:10:31.155 --> 02:10:32.396]  Well, let me say it slightly differently.
[02:10:32.416 --> 02:10:37.017]  After we had kind of given up the objective of Bin Laden, we then focused on weapons of mass destruction.
[02:10:37.137 --> 02:10:37.278]  Okay?
[02:10:58.513 --> 02:11:01.395]  Let me go back to the Cold War.
[02:11:02.255 --> 02:11:22.008]  We held the Soviet Union with all of their nukes, all of their nukes, and they had not one, not two, they were already developed, they were pointed at us, and we held the Soviet Union at bay with an objective that says, we want to prevent World War III.
[02:11:22.689 --> 02:11:25.991]  And we held them without war.
[02:11:27.321 --> 02:11:32.102]  War should be the last option, not the first.
[02:11:32.182 --> 02:11:38.084]  General, what do you think of Bush saying that they may hit up to 200 sites in Iraq with many nukes?
[02:11:40.144 --> 02:11:45.966]  If we... Well, first of all, I find that a very difficult statement.
[02:11:46.026 --> 02:11:50.927]  I cannot believe that the United States would start a nuke war.
[02:11:51.407 --> 02:11:56.128]  I just have great difficulty with us starting a nuke war.
[02:11:57.376 --> 02:12:07.602]  Although the use of depleted uranium armaments has in fact created a nuclear aggression against the people of the Middle East.
[02:12:08.590 --> 02:12:21.578]  With a multi-billion year half-life, and that stuff, radiation detectors, I'm sure you guys know this, have picked it up in England and the U.S., the exact isotope from DU, and it's the equivalent in weight to 44,000 Hiroshima and A-bombs.
[02:12:21.938 --> 02:12:22.638]  Exactly.
[02:12:23.059 --> 02:12:23.359]  I know.
[02:12:23.839 --> 02:12:24.479]  I know.
[02:12:24.499 --> 02:12:28.682]  Sir, I mean, you are at the highest level, a multi-star general, heading up entire programs.
[02:12:29.042 --> 02:12:34.045]  How do you think the elite has gotten to the point where their children are breathing this uranium too?
[02:12:34.145 --> 02:12:35.506]  Why are they doing this?
[02:12:36.326 --> 02:12:37.047]  I can't imagine.
[02:12:37.965 --> 02:12:39.606]  Alex, that just is beyond me.
[02:12:40.127 --> 02:12:43.269]  I look at... I always look at... I'll tell you what.
[02:12:44.190 --> 02:12:54.817]  All you have to do, Alex, is deliver one body back to one mother, and you understand war is the last resort, not the first.
[02:12:55.037 --> 02:13:03.604]  Just deliver one body back to a mother, and you understand it totally internal, and you will never, ever forget it.
[02:13:04.244 --> 02:13:04.664]  Period.
[02:13:05.945 --> 02:13:06.746]  And now we take
[02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:11.614]  Look, Codex, again, it is not unrelated as you know and as your listeners know.
[02:13:11.674 --> 02:13:13.836]  This is another war against us.
[02:13:13.976 --> 02:13:19.320]  It's as insane as the war that is killing us with our own depleted uranium.
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:25.505]  That is, the war that is killing our soldiers with anthrax vaccines that have squalene.
[02:13:25.545 --> 02:13:35.594]  And oh, by the way, the new nonsense vaccine against the new nonsense pandemic, Bravian flu, will have squalene.
[02:13:36.049 --> 02:13:39.691]  Squalene is the primary cause of Gulf War Syndrome.
[02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:41.172]  Injected squalene.
[02:13:41.492 --> 02:13:43.733]  We are now testing... Now, you're a medical doctor.
[02:13:43.773 --> 02:13:45.534]  Explain to people why squalene's bad.
[02:13:45.815 --> 02:13:46.775]  We know mercury's bad.
[02:13:46.815 --> 02:13:52.698]  We know the genetic garbage, the monkey pus and vomit, as laymen call it, in the vaccines is very dangerous.
[02:13:52.718 --> 02:13:53.939]  It's full of cancer viruses.
[02:13:54.279 --> 02:13:55.040]  That's been confirmed.
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:14:00.443]  Not just the polio injections or the oral, but why is squalene bad?
[02:14:01.670 --> 02:14:05.771]  If you rub squalene on your skin, it makes your skin nice and soft.
[02:14:05.991 --> 02:14:08.932]  If you eat squalene, that's perfectly okay.
[02:14:08.972 --> 02:14:21.114]  But if you inject squalene, the impact is to rev up the immune system to make antibodies to whatever it is that you've injected it along with, which is why it's called an adjuvant, which is an activating agent.
[02:14:21.614 --> 02:14:25.475]  And there's no way to turn off the immune system.
[02:14:25.715 --> 02:14:28.416]  We've all heard by now of autoimmune diseases.
[02:14:28.756 --> 02:14:30.616]  When the body attacks the body,
[02:14:31.349 --> 02:14:38.536]  In fact, a lot of groups who take all these new vaccines die in like two weeks of these, they call it accelerated autoimmune disorders.
[02:14:38.836 --> 02:14:48.265]  Precisely, and those who don't die in two weeks die over a long, painful, and highly profitable to the pharmaceutical and medical industry, disability.
[02:14:48.305 --> 02:14:50.927]  What about all these new diseases women have?
[02:14:50.947 --> 02:14:55.171]  I mean, I know young women who can't get out of bed, their joints are all swollen up.
[02:14:55.211 --> 02:14:55.932]  What's going on?
[02:14:56.332 --> 02:14:56.953]  Toxicity.
[02:14:57.433 --> 02:15:00.056]  Toxicity, toxicity and the vaccines.
[02:15:00.156 --> 02:15:01.357]  Let me point this out.
[02:15:01.998 --> 02:15:08.265]  If you're putting poison into your body through your mouth or through a vaccination, you are poisoned.
[02:15:08.445 --> 02:15:13.250]  If you are poisoned, the enzyme systems of your body cannot function properly.
[02:15:13.570 --> 02:15:18.756]  You will become ill with a variety of different diseases that have a wide spectrum of names.
[02:15:19.184 --> 02:15:19.585]  Thank you for
[02:15:34.502 --> 02:15:58.943]  Now they admit that irradiating food, already most of the stuff in schools and most of the stuff at McDonald's has been irradiated, now it's thousands of foods, tuna fish, I mean they're just doing it, and they admit that it kills the ring structures, it kills the enzymes, and that it is just deadly to eat that, and now they can feed you rotten food that was rotten, it still has got the dead bacteria with the toxins they produced in their excretion.
[02:15:59.263 --> 02:16:02.826]  Precisely, it also has high levels of
[02:16:03.728 --> 02:16:09.952]  free radicals which cause diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, macular degeneration, etc, etc.
[02:16:10.253 --> 02:16:16.197]  And the only protection that you have against free radicals is to take high levels of antioxidants.
[02:16:16.257 --> 02:16:16.857]  But ah!
[02:16:17.237 --> 02:16:23.762]  Codex has ratified the vitamin and mineral guideline last July 4th, ironically, 2005.
[02:16:27.704 --> 02:16:33.068]  With the jubilation of the United States Codex point of contact at Scarborough
[02:16:33.690 --> 02:16:52.861]  And Bert and I were there to see this atrocity, and what it does is say that any effective level of a nutrient, for instance, a nutrient that changes anything in your body, is now considered an adverse event associated with that nutrient.
[02:16:53.261 --> 02:16:56.063]  The World Health Organization... They're labeling it as a drug!
[02:16:56.810 --> 02:16:57.250]  Well, no.
[02:16:57.710 --> 02:17:03.293]  You see, many people say, oh, well, vitamins and minerals will just be available as drugs with a prescription.
[02:17:03.493 --> 02:17:04.613]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:17:04.974 --> 02:17:09.295]  They will be illegal substances in the way that heroin is illegal.
[02:17:09.616 --> 02:17:12.217]  You cannot write a prescription... By the way, I've read the documents.
[02:17:12.797 --> 02:17:14.898]  SWAT teams will be raiding your home.
[02:17:15.178 --> 02:17:19.520]  You'll be going to prison camps for having vitamin C. A woman who is a pharmacist...
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.121]  A woman who is a pharmacist in France.
[02:17:22.161 --> 02:17:24.101]  Now, in Europe, you buy your... Stay there.
[02:17:24.121 --> 02:17:24.841]  We've got a break again.
[02:17:24.861 --> 02:17:30.463]  We'll come back and finish up with Codex Alimentarius in the next little five-minute segment, tell folks about the DVD you guys offer.
[02:17:30.703 --> 02:17:37.785]  Then I want to shift gears and take calls and get into some of the things the General did while heading up high-level military army operations.
[02:17:38.305 --> 02:17:40.586]  We've got to have you guys back up, too.
[02:17:40.726 --> 02:17:43.307]  These two hours are evaporating rapidly.
[02:17:46.329 --> 02:17:54.956]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:17:55.176 --> 02:18:06.466]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:18:06.666 --> 02:18:09.308]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:09.648 --> 02:18:16.116]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:18:16.276 --> 02:18:18.138]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:18:18.338 --> 02:18:24.365]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:18:24.625 --> 02:18:30.292]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:18:30.612 --> 02:18:34.537]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.557 --> 02:18:35.258]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:35.278 --> 02:18:35.978]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:48.297 --> 02:18:49.337]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.738 --> 02:18:55.240]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:56.300]  That's right.
[02:18:56.620 --> 02:18:59.501]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:00.302 --> 02:19:06.384]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.934 --> 02:19:14.640]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:15.081 --> 02:19:19.885]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:20.547 --> 02:19:25.572]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:26.373 --> 02:19:30.517]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.878 --> 02:19:31.118]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.138 --> 02:19:33.080]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:33.440]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.761 --> 02:19:34.041]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:49.708 --> 02:19:57.091]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:19:58.191 --> 02:20:07.855]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:20:08.775 --> 02:20:15.338]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:20:16.317 --> 02:20:25.163]  We would like to send you a one-year absolutely free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[02:20:25.763 --> 02:20:27.324]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.344 --> 02:20:27.564]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.584 --> 02:20:27.765]  Call now.
[02:20:27.785 --> 02:20:33.148]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:20:46.448 --> 02:20:48.289]  Gas prices are out of control.
[02:20:48.529 --> 02:20:52.691]  You drive up to the pump only to find that the price per gallon is up once again.
[02:20:53.051 --> 02:20:57.573]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[02:20:57.773 --> 02:21:02.275]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using
[02:21:02.335 --> 02:21:03.877]  We're good to go!
[02:21:21.816 --> 02:21:25.999]  Yes, MPG caps are designed for use in all gasoline or diesel powered engines.
[02:21:26.379 --> 02:21:32.403]  And you can also have a lucrative home-based business by simply sharing this amazing, money-saving product with others.
[02:21:32.563 --> 02:21:33.084]  Don't wait!
[02:21:33.204 --> 02:21:34.945]  Call MPG Biz now at 800-526-1778.
[02:21:34.965 --> 02:21:35.165]  That's 800-526-1778.
[02:21:35.185 --> 02:21:36.226]  Or visit the webpage at mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:36.266 --> 02:21:36.826]  That's mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:48.573 --> 02:21:52.677]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:21:53.658 --> 02:21:56.961]  We're talking to Major General U.S.
[02:21:57.081 --> 02:22:07.932]  Army Retired Albert N. Stubblebine III, and we're also talking to his wife, who is a medical doctor, and we're honored to have both of them with us.
[02:22:08.833 --> 02:22:10.535]  Doctor, going back to you and
[02:22:11.753 --> 02:22:18.396]  Again, we've got links to your website, healthfreedomusa.org, and several others up on Infowars.com.
[02:22:18.936 --> 02:22:20.876]  I've read the rulings in Europe.
[02:22:20.896 --> 02:22:23.017]  You were talking about a French doctor before we went to break.
[02:22:23.457 --> 02:22:24.518]  People are getting arrested.
[02:22:24.718 --> 02:22:32.581]  They're trying to, quote, make vitamin C be like a prescription, but it's adulterated and only down at very low levels, having, you know, megadoses that
[02:22:33.041 --> 02:22:38.162]  Linus Pauling and other Nobel Prize winners have said you absolutely need, those will be restricted.
[02:22:38.722 --> 02:22:44.243]  All of this, when vitamin C is a basic building block, you don't have it, your collagen falls apart and you get scurvy.
[02:22:45.304 --> 02:22:53.005]  And then we see all the propaganda, endless newscasts, oh there's evil stuff you can buy at the drug store, I mean at the health food store, we've got to ban it, we've got to control it.
[02:22:53.305 --> 02:23:00.047]  When they can't even find a few deaths a year from over-the-counter vitamins and nutrients and phytonutrients and other things,
[02:23:00.407 --> 02:23:09.135]  But there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands, almost 300,000 a year they admit, just from adverse drug reactions from prescription drugs.
[02:23:09.435 --> 02:23:13.519]  So kind of show up what's going on with this Codex Alimentarius.
[02:23:13.779 --> 02:23:17.542]  You guys are traveling the world, even meeting with world leaders trying to beat this.
[02:23:17.582 --> 02:23:18.103]  Tell us about it.
[02:23:19.602 --> 02:23:21.203]  We are traveling with world leaders.
[02:23:21.263 --> 02:23:24.425]  We are saying to them, you know that Codex will kill your people.
[02:23:24.485 --> 02:23:31.488]  Well, here is the legal answer to protect yourself from the trade sanctions that are used to enforce Codex.
[02:23:31.548 --> 02:23:38.891]  And we present them with the e-book that you can buy at www.healthfreedomusa.org.
[02:23:39.111 --> 02:23:41.092]  Same document that has been presented.
[02:23:41.372 --> 02:23:42.613]  Huge amount of information.
[02:23:42.952 --> 02:23:58.316]  You can also become informed on Codex Codex's history and what you can do to keep the United States from becoming the pharmaceutical realm of death that it's working up to by looking at Nutricide, the DVD.
[02:23:58.356 --> 02:24:00.517]  That's also available on our website.
[02:24:01.097 --> 02:24:02.878]  You can sign the citizen's petition.
[02:24:02.938 --> 02:24:06.759]  Now, recently, as a matter of fact, last week, Codex
[02:24:07.552 --> 02:24:19.208]  Was dealt a stunning blow by the actions of the South African delegate whom we have been working with and supporting out of our international program.
[02:24:19.796 --> 02:24:30.738]  And I don't have time to explain it to you, but if we can generate the kind of support here in the United States and abroad that we need to, we can turn Codex around.
[02:24:31.078 --> 02:24:35.339]  I think in five years the multinational corporations will kill it, but that's okay with me.
[02:24:35.659 --> 02:24:46.841]  The point is, if we have your support, and that's financial support, it's information dissemination support, sign up for the newsletter and spread it to everyone you know, if we have your
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:25:09.940]  Your active support in terms of telling Congress what you want them to do to protect you and if we have you as a growing body of informed consumers who are not going to die because it's handy and useful for the multinational corporation masters to have you die and have your children suffer and die too.
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:14.544]  If we have this body of support here and internationally
[02:25:14.992 --> 02:25:17.112]  We can win this battle.
[02:25:17.352 --> 02:25:19.893]  If we don't have the support, we won't win.
[02:25:20.253 --> 02:25:27.655]  Dr. Labo, we also have good victories where areas of Europe and Latin America are refusing genetically engineered crops being brought in.
[02:25:27.715 --> 02:25:29.315]  So there is good news happening.
[02:25:29.375 --> 02:25:34.076]  But in the last minute or two of this segment, we're going to come back and talk to the General some more and take some calls.
[02:25:34.396 --> 02:25:38.857]  And you as well, I hope you'll ride shotgun with us, Doctor, through the rest of the broadcast that we've got left.
[02:25:40.177 --> 02:25:44.538]  Under Codex, we're looking from what I've read, what I've seen, and this is admitted, they're saying this,
[02:25:45.353 --> 02:25:52.420]  Where everything is genetically modified, everything is full of poisons and preservatives, where you cannot get organic.
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:58.706]  I mean, they're already changing the laws here where something can be 75% genetically engineered and they call it organic.
[02:25:59.267 --> 02:26:00.588]  This is a nightmare system.
[02:26:01.089 --> 02:26:06.234]  Can you add any more to what life under full implementation of Codex Alimentarius will be like?
[02:26:06.892 --> 02:26:11.654]  Life under full implementation of Codex Alimentarius will be sickness and death.
[02:26:11.974 --> 02:26:17.456]  The World Health Organization has identified the non-communicable diseases of undernutrition.
[02:26:17.496 --> 02:26:21.078]  They're cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, etc.
[02:26:21.538 --> 02:26:25.299]  Those are the diseases that Codex guarantees to you and your children.
[02:26:25.580 --> 02:26:27.780]  If that's what you want, don't do anything.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:30.201]  If that's not what you want, take action.
[02:26:30.361 --> 02:26:34.043]  I agree with you and I would just add this little addendum or caveat to this.
[02:26:35.109 --> 02:26:37.190]  Well, I would agree with what you said.
[02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:37.510]  In terms of
[02:27:00.666 --> 02:27:06.491]  The fact that we're moving in the direction where everybody is going to be sick.
[02:27:06.511 --> 02:27:09.753]  If you don't take care of your immune system, you're not going to survive.
[02:27:10.193 --> 02:27:12.555]  You must be able to take care of your immune system.
[02:27:12.595 --> 02:27:13.296]  You must be.
[02:27:13.756 --> 02:27:23.724]  And oh, by the way, in order to do that, you've got to get up and, like the dog that's in the down stay, you've got to get up, get that dog up, and get him barking.
[02:27:23.804 --> 02:27:25.505]  You've got to take the actions.
[02:27:25.545 --> 02:27:30.329]  You've got to go to the website, www.healthfreedomusa.gov.
[02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:34.619]  Absolutely, we'll be right back.
[02:27:36.601 --> 02:27:39.604]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.524 --> 02:27:43.207]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.641 --> 02:27:53.504]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:53.644 --> 02:28:06.568]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:28:06.748 --> 02:28:08.549]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:28:08.729 --> 02:28:12.190]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:28:12.470 --> 02:28:16.252]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:28:16.512 --> 02:28:21.454]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:28:21.734 --> 02:28:23.434]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:28:23.715 --> 02:28:27.696]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:28:27.936 --> 02:28:29.757]  Zango is what you are looking for.

[02:28:46.643 --> 02:28:48.284]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.404 --> 02:28:52.525]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.645 --> 02:28:55.526]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.606 --> 02:29:02.269]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.489 --> 02:29:05.493]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.713 --> 02:29:08.096]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:08.237 --> 02:29:18.390]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[02:29:18.570 --> 02:29:27.696]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:27.856 --> 02:29:35.601]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.621 --> 02:29:36.061]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.121 --> 02:29:37.803]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:29:46.178 --> 02:29:50.221]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:50.441 --> 02:29:53.823]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:54.004 --> 02:29:57.466]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.754 --> 02:30:00.996]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:01.016 --> 02:30:06.499]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[02:30:06.519 --> 02:30:14.603]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later.
[02:30:14.783 --> 02:30:16.164]  We know we're doing something right.
[02:30:16.284 --> 02:30:17.625]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:30:17.665 --> 02:30:23.068]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:23.568 --> 02:30:28.051]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:28.071 --> 02:30:29.452]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:29.612 --> 02:30:33.634]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:33.914 --> 02:30:35.595]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:54.904 --> 02:30:58.266]  Everything Albert N. Stubblebine III, Major General, U.S.
[02:30:58.326 --> 02:31:18.457]  Army, retired, has said, I know to be backed up from the research and verifiable, non-debatable facts I've seen, and of course his wife, is just another amazing individual, Dr. Lebow, and we're about to go to some of your phone calls here in a few minutes, but at the same time,
[02:31:19.304 --> 02:31:29.426]  There's been a lot of demonization of these two, both by the mainstream media and the alternative media, and you've got to ask why, and answer this information that many of us have even picked up on.
[02:31:29.926 --> 02:31:32.667]  But I mean, some of it is really wild.
[02:31:32.687 --> 02:31:35.587]  Some of the things I can't prove, some of the things I'm not informed on.
[02:31:35.607 --> 02:31:39.288]  I mean, I'm a meat and potatoes guy when it comes to information.
[02:31:39.308 --> 02:31:41.769]  I just go off the information that's out there that we know about.
[02:31:42.409 --> 02:31:45.509]  So much of what you think is secret is really public if you know where to look.
[02:31:46.509 --> 02:31:48.870]  But General Stubblebine
[02:31:50.035 --> 02:31:56.478]  Continuing talking to you, go through just for a few minutes some of the other mainline programs you ran.
[02:31:56.498 --> 02:32:08.462]  I mean, you were a multi-star general and you worked at every level of intelligence, you name it, and then you really did pioneer the remote viewing, what you'd call Army psychic program.
[02:32:09.023 --> 02:32:15.925]  And I have seen the transcript from CNN of when the CIA director was on Larry King Live many years ago and said, well, the program only had 85% success.
[02:32:15.965 --> 02:32:16.846]  Well, that's insane success.
[02:32:19.987 --> 02:32:30.015]  The military will do a program and if it gets 10-15% success, just keep doing it and then you build up the success rate and war game it out in the live laboratory of the world.
[02:32:31.534 --> 02:32:34.496]  I know that many of our leaders believe in this stuff and are involved in it.
[02:32:34.556 --> 02:32:36.617]  Of course, I'm a Christian myself.
[02:32:36.637 --> 02:32:37.838]  Many people believe it's occultic.
[02:32:37.878 --> 02:32:40.240]  Certainly, some of that is probably involved.
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:52.348]  But I want to get your whole view on this and what you can tell us that is declassified versus some of the mainstream international TV programs they've done where you say they falsely reported that
[02:32:52.908 --> 02:33:01.633]  That you and others tried to kill goats with your mind or tried to walk through walls and all of this because I see you on the board of a major submarine company.
[02:33:01.933 --> 02:33:06.695]  You're one of the founders of Aegis with one of the big security slash merc organizations.
[02:33:06.735 --> 02:33:10.757]  I don't mean to use that term but I've used it in the past so I'll just be honest here and use it in front of you now.
[02:33:11.098 --> 02:33:12.618]  I mean you're involved in anything and everything.
[02:33:12.658 --> 02:33:13.639]  It's all serious.
[02:33:14.019 --> 02:33:17.760]  Let me start with one of the other pieces about the goats, because I think we need to put that to bed.
[02:33:39.478 --> 02:33:53.029]  When I became the Commanding General of the Intelligence and Security Command, we were at a point where the forces were being drawn down, so resources were getting shorter, and requirements were still going up.
[02:33:53.630 --> 02:34:01.356]  And so, I looked at that problem and I said, one of the solutions is to have people work longer.
[02:34:01.376 --> 02:34:04.859]  Another solution is to have people work better.
[02:34:06.996 --> 02:34:11.458]  With that in mind, I put together a task force, which I call my High Performance Task Force.
[02:34:11.478 --> 02:34:20.081]  I took one of my brigadiers, put him in charge, and told him to go out and find all of the technologies around the world that allow people to work better, not longer.
[02:34:20.662 --> 02:34:20.982]  Okay?
[02:34:22.182 --> 02:34:29.125]  And he took about 60 days, and we came back, and I was like a kid in a candy store with all these technologies.
[02:34:29.865 --> 02:34:36.028]  Some of them you had to throw away immediately because they had dealings with SAC.
[02:34:36.542 --> 02:34:38.543]  Well, my job was intelligence.
[02:35:01.997 --> 02:35:08.898]  My job, man, was to find out what the Soviets, primarily the Soviets, were doing at that time, during the Cold War.
[02:35:10.219 --> 02:35:11.379]  And they were doing this?
[02:35:12.079 --> 02:35:16.300]  Well, I did not have the responsibility for killing.
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:18.400]  My responsibility was intelligence.
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:23.981]  So I took that technology and I took it to the people who were responsible for doing that.
[02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:26.922]  I gave it to them and said, here, this is yours.
[02:35:27.751 --> 02:35:28.572]  If it works, fine.
[02:35:28.612 --> 02:35:29.933]  If it doesn't, that's okay, too.
[02:35:29.953 --> 02:35:34.136]  So what you were doing was trying to duplicate what the Chai Khans and the Russians were doing?
[02:35:34.476 --> 02:35:38.058]  Yeah, but, you know, killing was not my responsibility.
[02:35:38.098 --> 02:35:45.864]  So I took it to the people who were responsible for training soldiers to go to battle and be the infantry and the special forces.
[02:35:45.924 --> 02:35:46.824]  And that was Fort Bragg?
[02:35:47.711 --> 02:35:51.053]  Yeah, and I gave it to them and told them, here, this is yours.
[02:35:51.313 --> 02:35:55.676]  Then I turned my back and I saw, you know, I didn't do anything with it after that.
[02:35:55.936 --> 02:35:58.198]  So, that was my total experience.
[02:35:58.438 --> 02:36:02.981]  And they were already using goats at Fort Bragg for testing battlefield medicine, correct?
[02:36:03.481 --> 02:36:04.162]  Well, I don't know.
[02:36:04.842 --> 02:36:12.868]  You know, my job, again, I'm back to my job, I had more than I could handle with just getting all of the intelligence that I needed.
[02:36:12.888 --> 02:36:13.888]  Well, what was the result?
[02:36:13.908 --> 02:36:15.689]  Can you tell us, were they able to kill the goats?
[02:36:17.634 --> 02:36:20.276]  I told you, you know, the answer is I don't know.
[02:36:21.317 --> 02:36:22.858]  Do I believe that it could work?
[02:36:23.178 --> 02:36:28.181]  Yeah, I could find a place in my mind that says that it probably will work.
[02:36:28.662 --> 02:36:28.942]  Why?
[02:36:29.322 --> 02:36:40.890]  Because I know that if you expand the mind and allow the mind to do all of the things that it can do, you can in fact do remote viewing.
[02:36:41.410 --> 02:36:45.033]  You can in fact, wait a minute, you can in fact break a board
[02:36:45.936 --> 02:36:49.157]  With your hand, without any major force.
[02:36:49.557 --> 02:36:54.798]  You can, in fact, bend a spoon, you know, like Uri Geller.
[02:36:55.358 --> 02:36:55.658]  Okay?
[02:36:55.798 --> 02:36:57.939]  You can do all of those things with your mind.
[02:36:57.979 --> 02:37:01.299]  General, let's get into what you were able to do then with the remote viewing program.
[02:37:01.579 --> 02:37:02.700]  I mean, you say it works.
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:03.780]  How does it work?
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:04.600]  What do you think it is?
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:07.621]  Well, let me give you a thought.
[02:37:08.101 --> 02:37:13.122]  And from there, let the viewers, or the listeners, go from there.
[02:37:13.974 --> 02:37:18.516]  If you take a point, we describe a point today as a dot.
[02:37:19.057 --> 02:37:19.417]  Okay?
[02:37:19.817 --> 02:37:21.458]  It does not have any dimension.
[02:37:21.638 --> 02:37:22.719]  It's just a dot.
[02:37:23.259 --> 02:37:23.579]  Okay?
[02:37:24.319 --> 02:37:30.783]  Let's think of that as, instead of a dot, let us think of time as a space.
[02:37:31.723 --> 02:37:36.526]  It has an X direction, it has a Y direction, and it has a Z dimension.
[02:37:37.706 --> 02:37:38.006]  Okay?
[02:37:38.567 --> 02:37:42.809]  Well, if my dot, or my space, is
[02:37:43.467 --> 02:37:45.468]  Got 1 inch by 1 inch by 1 inch.
[02:37:45.608 --> 02:37:49.889]  I can be anywhere in that 1 inch cube simultaneously.
[02:37:51.069 --> 02:37:51.649]  Extend that.
[02:37:51.929 --> 02:37:54.430]  Instead of 1 inch, make it 1 mile.
[02:37:55.410 --> 02:37:57.111]  1 mile by 1 mile by 1 mile.
[02:37:57.271 --> 02:37:58.811]  I now have a cubic mile.
[02:37:59.812 --> 02:38:04.073]  I can be anywhere in that space at a single time.
[02:38:05.813 --> 02:38:06.594]  Don't use a mile.
[02:38:06.814 --> 02:38:07.194]  Use 10,000 miles.
[02:38:09.432 --> 02:38:10.833]  Or 50,000 miles.
[02:38:10.973 --> 02:38:12.014]  But this is theoretical.
[02:38:12.034 --> 02:38:18.279]  Can you tell us specifically, as much as you can without anything that's classified, what the success was?
[02:38:18.379 --> 02:38:20.861]  What your people verifiably were able to do?
[02:38:21.682 --> 02:38:25.865]  No, I cannot tell you that because I believe that that number is still classified.
[02:38:25.945 --> 02:38:28.848]  However, I can say that it is better than what Gates said.
[02:38:30.849 --> 02:38:32.290]  Better than 85%?
[02:38:32.350 --> 02:38:34.472]  I mean, hypothetically... Better.
[02:38:35.153 --> 02:38:37.755]  I mean, hypothetically, how does remote viewing work?
[02:38:38.894 --> 02:38:43.016]  You go into that space that I just described, and you can be anywhere in it.
[02:38:43.316 --> 02:38:44.597]  Let me add something.
[02:38:46.097 --> 02:39:02.986]  Information can be linear, in which case any point contains only the information of that point, or it can be fractal, which means that it's holographic, and all points can contain all information simultaneously.
[02:39:03.446 --> 02:39:05.807]  The technique of remote viewing
[02:39:06.368 --> 02:39:18.316]  Can be understood, I think, best by saying you tap into the fractal nature of information, the holographic nature, so that wherever you go with your mind
[02:39:18.826 --> 02:39:24.808]  You can tap into all information that exists, past, present, and disturbingly, future.
[02:39:24.828 --> 02:39:40.735]  Well, Doctor, let me just say this because I never get into this stuff on the air, I never talk about it, I'm a pretty orthodox Christian, but I have had dreams where I've gotten up and written them down where somebody I don't know in a blue and green striped polo shirt assaults me
[02:39:41.375 --> 02:39:46.680]  And then all of a sudden, as I walk around the corner five months later, there's that very person and they try to mug me.
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:49.462]  And you wake up with sweat when you have a dream like this.
[02:39:49.502 --> 02:39:50.943]  You write it down and it happens.
[02:39:52.825 --> 02:39:54.746]  I had all the data, the info about 9-11.
[02:39:54.787 --> 02:40:00.631]  So most of it was just my subconscious mind being able to, you know, at the computer to war game it out.
[02:40:00.852 --> 02:40:03.974]  But I went on air and said they're going to attack, they're going to attack the World Trade Center.
[02:40:04.455 --> 02:40:06.376]  This guy's, you know, an operative of the Globalist.
[02:40:06.396 --> 02:40:07.177]  They're going to do this.
[02:40:07.577 --> 02:40:08.478]  This is what's going to happen.
[02:40:08.518 --> 02:40:09.439]  I mean, I did that on record.
[02:40:10.563 --> 02:40:11.789]  So you're my viewer?
[02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.894]  Doesn't prophecy...
[02:40:13.650 --> 02:40:15.031]  exist in the Bible, Alex?
[02:40:15.211 --> 02:40:19.294]  Doesn't the Judeo-Christian tradition admit of prophecy?
[02:40:19.354 --> 02:40:24.578]  And isn't prophecy a way of tapping into information that hasn't yet precipitated into event?
[02:40:24.598 --> 02:40:35.826]  Well, I'm just saying, and I don't want to get off into it, I've never said this on air, and now I'm really going to get attacked, but my whole life this has been happening to me, and... But it's nothing... It happens to everybody, exactly!
[02:40:36.546 --> 02:40:38.888]  It's part of the human context.
[02:40:39.168 --> 02:40:40.689]  Let me say one thing quickly, Alex.
[02:40:40.929 --> 02:40:42.891]  You talked about our founding ages.
[02:40:43.391 --> 02:40:51.013]  Aegis was a project which was approved but which was never funded and which never came into being.
[02:40:51.093 --> 02:40:56.274]  It was a private, civilian, homeland security project.
[02:40:56.334 --> 02:40:59.014]  So somebody took your idea and ran with it?
[02:40:59.234 --> 02:41:01.635]  So something else happened to it later then?
[02:41:01.695 --> 02:41:03.435]  Somebody else may have taken that name.
[02:41:04.315 --> 02:41:07.376]  But we are not involved with Merck in any way.
[02:41:07.436 --> 02:41:10.297]  We are not involved with any corporation in any way.
[02:41:10.497 --> 02:41:11.017]  So they took that name.
[02:41:13.652 --> 02:41:15.433]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:41:15.493 --> 02:41:21.774]  We are absolutely not involved with anything, and we're not involved with Aegis, because although it was approved, it was never funded.
[02:41:22.394 --> 02:41:28.615]  So it never went anywhere, other than an idea, which was a great idea, incidentally, but it never went anywhere.
[02:41:28.635 --> 02:41:30.376]  Well, I've got to get your guys back on.
[02:41:30.616 --> 02:41:34.036]  Let me go back to the prophecy stuff.
[02:41:36.177 --> 02:41:40.098]  You were not doing remote viewing when you saw that bugger.
[02:41:40.458 --> 02:41:42.178]  You were doing remote dreaming.
[02:41:44.224 --> 02:41:44.564]  Okay?
[02:41:44.925 --> 02:41:48.848]  But it was the same process, exactly the same process.
[02:41:49.028 --> 02:41:51.891]  You were not in your bed.
[02:41:52.091 --> 02:41:55.714]  You were in some space external to that.
[02:41:55.854 --> 02:42:05.822]  And again, go to my diagram of time, X, Y, and Z. And in this case, I don't know how far away you were from the time when you dreamed it until the time that it occurred.
[02:42:06.323 --> 02:42:12.448]  But whatever that distance is, make that X, Y, and Z, and you were in that cube simultaneously with the event.
[02:42:13.644 --> 02:42:14.985]  And so you can be there.
[02:42:15.085 --> 02:42:17.986]  So I look at that and I say, so what's the big deal?
[02:42:18.866 --> 02:42:19.687]  You know, it works.
[02:42:20.507 --> 02:42:21.407]  And it works better than 85%.
[02:42:21.528 --> 02:42:23.428]  Here's an example.
[02:42:23.488 --> 02:42:29.331]  My grandmother had been sick for a while, but she wasn't anywhere near death at the time, and I hadn't seen her in months, and I called my dad.
[02:42:30.197 --> 02:42:42.021]  And I said, we've got to go to Fairfield to see your mom, and we got in the car on our way there, and then they called us on the cell phone, and we hadn't even told them we were coming, and said she just died.
[02:42:42.341 --> 02:42:44.041]  So actually, it's just amazing.
[02:42:44.361 --> 02:42:55.225]  But that, I mean, like the Aborigines in Australia, and this is totally documented, they'll come out of an opal or diamond mine and say, put me on a plane, my mother just died, or my father's sick, and they're never wrong.
[02:42:55.745 --> 02:42:56.125]  That's right.
[02:42:56.877 --> 02:43:00.958]  That's exactly right, and oh by the way, you just said it, they're never wrong.
[02:43:01.978 --> 02:43:03.779]  That's part of the human capacity.
[02:43:04.119 --> 02:43:14.801]  Now, by the way, if you poison the body and the brain, that capacity to know and to know well is diminished, and that's part of what we will lose.
[02:43:14.841 --> 02:43:20.203]  The human capacity to be healthy, to defend itself, and to know is being poisoned.
[02:43:20.263 --> 02:43:24.924]  The human capacity to reproduce is being poisoned, and that's how Codex
[02:43:26.463 --> 02:43:28.485]  is carrying out its war.
[02:43:28.585 --> 02:43:34.249]  General, do you think the elite are threatened by the general population not being poisoned and having their full discernment?
[02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:36.331]  I have not a clue.
[02:43:37.492 --> 02:43:45.558]  Alex, I try not to go there and the reason is that I've got to stay focused on what our objective is.
[02:43:45.578 --> 02:43:48.600]  I went back and explained how important the objective is.
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:52.243]  Our objective is health, protecting our health and our health freedom.
[02:43:52.816 --> 02:44:00.043]  There are so many things that we could get diverted to do and play with that would be very exciting.
[02:44:00.603 --> 02:44:01.264]  Can't afford it.
[02:44:01.324 --> 02:44:14.657]  We've got to use all of our energy to ensure that our health and our health freedoms are absolutely protected, which is precisely why we're after a codex.
[02:44:14.797 --> 02:44:15.998]  That's where our focus is.
[02:44:16.696 --> 02:44:19.717]  So, I don't know what their agenda is.
[02:44:20.078 --> 02:44:34.604]  Sure, sure, but I mean, back to remote viewing, to me, you know, knowing things or sensing things or seeing things in the future, I mean, that's something that's never been controllable, though, and I couldn't even imagine trying to control something like that.
[02:44:35.465 --> 02:44:42.568]  When the Soviets attempted to use their remote viewers, they called them something else, their psychic spies,
[02:44:43.815 --> 02:44:45.376]  for evil purposes.
[02:44:45.756 --> 02:44:55.018]  By the time these people were able to do this, they were also able to connect to a larger agenda of the universe, the cosmos, and they said no.
[02:44:55.198 --> 02:44:57.559]  And the Soviets said, well, we'll kill you if you don't.
[02:44:57.579 --> 02:44:59.259]  And they said, okay, it doesn't matter.
[02:44:59.499 --> 02:45:10.002]  The Soviets were extraordinarily frustrated because they could get their people to a certain level and no higher because when they became especially adroit at remote viewing or psychic spying,
[02:45:10.376 --> 02:45:16.743]  They also clicked into what the universe is all about and they understood that there was a moral
[02:45:19.026 --> 02:45:20.227]  That's a good question.
[02:45:42.682 --> 02:45:45.803]  But my experience is that, you know, let me just give you an example.
[02:45:45.843 --> 02:45:59.648]  When people got sort of greedy and tried to use it to predict the stock market, you know, the ups and downs of the commodity markets and so on, that they really didn't, actually they failed.
[02:46:00.208 --> 02:46:00.688]  And why?
[02:46:00.908 --> 02:46:04.629]  Because greed got in the way of right.
[02:46:05.370 --> 02:46:09.271]  When you use it for the right purposes and the right intentionality,
[02:46:09.913 --> 02:46:14.757]  I believe that it will work very well and very, you know, completely.
[02:46:15.317 --> 02:46:25.024]  When you get greedy, when you get evil, when you go in a different direction, then I think it tends to fall off in its effectiveness.
[02:46:25.284 --> 02:46:27.886]  Well, that may be because you are working with something that's good.
[02:46:27.926 --> 02:46:34.691]  I mean, there's a dark side to everything, and I think that, in fact, I know there are people tapping into the dark side, and I know that that's there.
[02:46:34.952 --> 02:46:36.152]  You just may not have looked at it.
[02:46:36.633 --> 02:46:37.053]  I haven't.
[02:46:37.273 --> 02:46:38.054]  I think I've seen it.
[02:46:38.573 --> 02:46:44.998]  I'm too goddamn busy doing what I gotta do and staying on track and so I haven't got time for the dark side.
[02:46:45.318 --> 02:46:47.260]  You know, it's like I'm gonna live to be another 176 years.
[02:46:49.393 --> 02:47:01.937]  Alex, may I say, I'm sitting at my computer and I've gotten a number of emails from your listeners, your active listeners, who have asked for the website of doctors who know how to treat things naturally, including cancer.
[02:47:02.297 --> 02:47:03.597]  May I give the website again?
[02:47:03.877 --> 02:47:04.577]  Sure, give it out again.
[02:47:04.597 --> 02:47:05.678]  We'll try to post it on InfoWars.com.
[02:47:05.698 --> 02:47:06.378]  Let me tell my people.
[02:47:06.398 --> 02:47:08.278]  www.aaem.com, a-a-e-m.com, and while you're at it,
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:29.989]  Make sure that you go to EatSafeEatSmart.com to get clean, non-GMO, organic snacks, personal care products, and to support our work.
[02:47:30.169 --> 02:47:32.671]  Sure, let me jam in a quick call to take a few more after the break.
[02:47:32.951 --> 02:47:34.372]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[02:47:34.432 --> 02:47:35.313]  Rodney, thanks for holding.
[02:47:35.353 --> 02:47:35.593]  Go ahead.
[02:47:35.613 --> 02:47:37.535]  Then we'll go to Bob and Ron and everybody else.
[02:47:37.575 --> 02:47:38.435]  Go ahead, Rodney.
[02:47:38.715 --> 02:47:43.259]  Thank you, Alex, for this mini-symposium with Dr. Leibo and the General.
[02:47:44.088 --> 02:47:46.849]  It's a pleasure to speak with you two people.
[02:47:47.029 --> 02:47:58.674]  Dr. Label, I heard that Donald Rumsfeld was one of the orchestrators of aspartame being marketed to the American people.
[02:47:58.734 --> 02:47:59.194]  It's true.
[02:48:00.574 --> 02:48:05.656]  But he made some very interesting remarks when he was confronted with the dangers of aspartame.
[02:48:05.696 --> 02:48:11.298]  And Dr. Label, I think I heard you quote his statements, and they were very, very stunning.
[02:48:11.338 --> 02:48:12.799]  Would you happen to have that quote?
[02:48:14.855 --> 02:48:32.260]  Jim Turner, who is an attorney who has been fighting for consumer rights for his entire career, went toe-to-toe with Donald Rumsfeld and Donald Rumsfeld was not able to get aspartame on the market for 11 years.
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:37.861]  He told Jim Turner, I don't care how many people it kills, I want it approved.
[02:48:38.354 --> 02:48:42.817]  And managed to do so by getting rid of the head of the FDA, getting his new guy.
[02:48:42.837 --> 02:48:43.898]  Final segment, Doctor.
[02:48:43.938 --> 02:48:44.818]  General, stay with us.
[02:48:44.858 --> 02:48:45.439]  Final segment.
[02:48:45.459 --> 02:48:46.099]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:49.962]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.622 --> 02:48:51.923]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:52.123 --> 02:48:57.867]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:58.127 --> 02:49:03.391]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:03.671 --> 02:49:05.312]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[02:49:05.472 --> 02:49:07.833]  This program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:07.993 --> 02:49:11.776]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:12.036 --> 02:49:16.678]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.758 --> 02:49:23.022]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:49:23.062 --> 02:49:24.883]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:49:25.363 --> 02:49:27.444]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:49:27.524 --> 02:49:31.807]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:31.887 --> 02:49:32.467]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:33.408 --> 02:49:39.091]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:49:39.171 --> 02:49:41.172]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:49:41.413 --> 02:49:42.934]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:43.094 --> 02:49:45.175]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:46.377 --> 02:49:51.601]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.742 --> 02:49:59.828]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:50:00.088 --> 02:50:06.954]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:08.075 --> 02:50:14.580]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.761 --> 02:50:19.845]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.965 --> 02:50:28.852]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:29.113 --> 02:50:32.415]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:55.232]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:56.781 --> 02:51:59.402]  There's a war on for your mind, and knowing is half the battle.
[02:51:59.462 --> 02:52:02.383]  I'm going to try to jam three calls in here at the end, and this has been a great interview.
[02:52:02.803 --> 02:52:05.083]  Got to have the doctor and the general back up in the near future.
[02:52:05.103 --> 02:52:07.604]  You can check out their websites at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:07.644 --> 02:52:09.605]  But quick questions or comments for our guests.
[02:52:10.225 --> 02:52:15.887]  Just a side issue, if you want to get any of my documentaries or books or other videos I carry, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:52:15.907 --> 02:52:17.527]  That also makes this broadcast possible.

[02:52:24.609 --> 02:52:28.691]  And we've got our big 9-11 Truth Conference coming up in L.A., the 24th and 25th.
[02:52:29.031 --> 02:52:33.993]  The tickets are going quick, ladies and gentlemen, so be sure and go to Infowars.com to find out more details.
[02:52:34.013 --> 02:52:38.696]  You can also call the toll-free number there on the site to buy the tickets if you prefer to get them that way.
[02:52:39.716 --> 02:52:43.978]  Rodney brought up a good point about Aspartame, and it's on the record that Rumsfeld's behind everything.
[02:52:44.338 --> 02:52:51.562]  Yes Alex, I don't know how fast I could be with this, it's held for quite a while, but in any event regarding the NSA
[02:53:15.577 --> 02:53:19.858]  Well, a phone tap, the harvesting of phone numbers in the tens of millions.
[02:53:22.459 --> 02:53:26.320]  The Bush administration has contradicted itself on this.
[02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:30.401]  Some of you may remember earlier statements that the administration made.
[02:53:31.361 --> 02:53:35.622]  Now the administration is making statements that contradict those.
[02:53:36.122 --> 02:53:40.343]  He said yesterday that the wiretaps are lawful.
[02:53:40.973 --> 02:53:49.180]  Now, it's important for people to understand that the word lawful is a very specific, legal, esoteric term.
[02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:50.461]  Ron, we're almost out of time.
[02:53:50.481 --> 02:53:52.422]  You're going to have to call me back tomorrow about this.
[02:53:52.462 --> 02:53:54.964]  You can get mad at me if you want, but I just... You're on Saturdays?
[02:53:55.565 --> 02:53:57.066]  Well, you know what that means, Monday.
[02:53:57.106 --> 02:53:58.467]  Thanks for the call, Ron, okay?
[02:53:59.308 --> 02:54:01.870]  I've just got to get these final callers and let our people come in.
[02:54:02.170 --> 02:54:07.414]  General, I mean, this wiretapping, Bush saying he's above the law, give us your take on it briefly.
[02:54:08.652 --> 02:54:12.934]  Well, I don't believe anybody should be above the law, frankly.
[02:54:13.274 --> 02:54:22.759]  And your caller, Ron, was right in the fact that lawful is in the mind of the beholder.
[02:54:23.559 --> 02:54:29.362]  And I don't think lawful in this case is used correctly.
[02:54:30.463 --> 02:54:36.506]  I think it's very questionable as to what is, in fact, legal in this respect.
[02:54:36.846 --> 02:54:37.266]  All right.
[02:54:38.574 --> 02:54:42.537]  Do we need to be surveillant and careful?
[02:54:43.177 --> 02:54:45.559]  Absolutely, that's what intelligence is all about.
[02:54:45.739 --> 02:54:55.686]  If you are after the fact on intelligence, you're no longer an intelligence officer, you're a history buff.
[02:54:55.787 --> 02:55:00.050]  Intelligence has got to be in front of the act.
[02:55:00.510 --> 02:55:02.852]  So if you need to get
[02:55:04.574 --> 02:55:12.299]  The lawful requirement to bug somebody's phone, then go get the damn authority!
[02:55:12.419 --> 02:55:12.980]  Go get it!
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:16.162]  What's wrong with going to the legal department to get it?
[02:55:16.182 --> 02:55:21.446]  Because he said, General, he said he wants to set the precedent to do whatever he wants, and that's what's dangerous.
[02:55:21.706 --> 02:55:25.688]  That's absolutely dangerous, because that puts the power in the hands.
[02:55:26.909 --> 02:55:31.032]  Extend that just a little bit further, and what you have is a dictator.
[02:55:31.653 --> 02:55:32.073]  Wrong!
[02:55:32.935 --> 02:55:34.497]  You've got to keep it legal.
[02:55:35.057 --> 02:55:35.498]  Period.
[02:55:37.099 --> 02:55:37.459]  You know what?
[02:55:37.499 --> 02:55:41.283]  I'm sorry to Frank and I'm sorry to everybody that's been holding on.
[02:55:41.423 --> 02:55:44.827]  Listeners, it was just too good of an interview and we didn't get to all of you, so forgive me.
[02:55:45.147 --> 02:55:45.968]  Call me back on Monday.
[02:55:45.988 --> 02:55:47.869]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:49.911]  General Docker, thank you both for joining us.
[02:55:49.951 --> 02:55:51.413]  We'll talk to you again in the future.
[02:55:51.873 --> 02:55:53.475]  Thanks so much for having us.
[02:55:53.815 --> 02:55:54.396]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:55:55.169 --> 02:55:57.911]  And all you listeners, have a great day!
[02:55:58.191 --> 02:55:59.631]  General, did you enjoy the interview?
[02:56:00.112 --> 02:56:00.352]  Yes!
[02:56:00.752 --> 02:56:01.372]  Well, I did too.
[02:56:01.613 --> 02:56:02.873]  And Doctor, did you have a good time?
[02:56:03.333 --> 02:56:03.834]  You bet!
[02:56:04.634 --> 02:56:09.857]  www.healthfreedomusa.org Absolutely, I appreciate the call.
[02:56:10.577 --> 02:56:15.380]  Wow, we heard a lot of propaganda and demonization of these folks, and I may have even been led into it a few times.
[02:56:15.420 --> 02:56:18.081]  It was interesting to get them on and hear what they actually had to say.
[02:56:18.141 --> 02:56:18.762]  Pretty interesting.
[02:56:19.082 --> 02:56:21.923]  Alright, we'll see you back tonight, 9 to midnight, and back on Monday, 11 to 2.
[02:56:21.963 --> 02:56:22.423]  God bless you all.
