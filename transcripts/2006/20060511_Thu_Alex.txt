[00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:06.481]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:08.203]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.025]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.665 --> 00:00:11.486]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.247 --> 00:00:13.208]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:17.532]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.992 --> 00:00:22.096]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:39.674]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.859]  Thank you for joining us on this live Thursday edition, the 11th day of May 2006.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.663]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:49.544]  We're good to go.
[00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:49.704]  I think?
[00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:27.394]  And his experiences working and living there and just how conditioned they are to follow orders of the government as well as many other societies around the planet.
[00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:30.855]  So that is coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:34.676]  Interesting little side tidbit here that I'll get to later.
[00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:41.098]  They shot a polar bear up near the North Pole and it turns out it's not a polar bear.
[00:01:41.178 --> 00:01:45.600]  It's part polar bear, part grizzly confirmed with DNA tests to be a hybrid.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.060]  That's just
[00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:50.039]  That's just interesting, so we'll be getting into that report.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.481]  I want to talk a little bit about the bird flu today.
[00:01:55.501 --> 00:02:08.425]  They've had a bunch of scares in the last few months, and they were saying that they were going to test migratory birds coming into the U.S., and they were sure they had the bird flu that was sure to kill us all, and only martial law would keep us safe.
[00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.566]  Well, we've got a report here today out of the New York Times.
[00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:15.408]  Migrating birds didn't carry flu, despite the popular beliefs.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.222]  Shifting gears internationally, Iranian President's letter highlights 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:02:23.982 --> 00:02:30.144]  And his comments are hidden in plain view in the article, in the letter he sent to Bush back on Sunday.
[00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:35.025]  But it's just now starting to garner some attention, so we'll be going over that.
[00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:38.746]  Paul Watson's written an article about it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:41.427]  Another story here by Wayne Madison.
[00:02:42.156 --> 00:02:45.480]  World leaders suspect the Bush administration of involvement in 9-11.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.901]  He gives some of the evidence of that.
[00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:52.147]  We'll go through some of the other world leaders that are openly questioning the official story.
[00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:55.810]  Congressman Tom Tancredo is speaking out on U.S.
[00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.212]  surveillance of Minutemen.
[00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:58.481]  That's right.
[00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:07.607]  They're every movement being relayed to the Mexican troops who openly fire upon them and also kill police and American citizens as well as kidnapping American citizens.
[00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:08.847]  But that's okay.
[00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.570]  They're our buddies, so the government's got to give all the intel and amendment to them.
[00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.471]  We'll give you Tom Tancredo's take on that.
[00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:19.434]  I have a little news clip I want to analyze out of Dallas, Channel 11.
[00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:26.538]  And this concerns immigration billboards going up in North Texas that say, Stop the Invasion!
[00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:29.337]  Finally striking back.
[00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:35.821]  They're doing a fabulous job, and I want to get the group on who is doing this in the near future, but we will talk about that coming up.
[00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:38.442]  Story here out of the Washington Post.
[00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:42.665]  Hardcore GOP flee Bush pollsters find.
[00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:51.210]  Conservatives are finally waking up that George Bush is the second coming of basically Ho Chi Minh and Bill Clinton mixed together.
[00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:53.805]  So we'll be getting into that report.
[00:03:54.285 --> 00:04:00.991]  And a really scary article I saw yesterday, they've now retracted their plans all over the country.
[00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:07.416]  You try to go take somebody to the prom who isn't from your high school, they do background checks on them.
[00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:11.179]  You can't let somebody in the prison without a background check.
[00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:16.464]  And that's what the children are being trained, the young people are being trained, the young adults are being trained that life is a prison.
[00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:21.623]  And George Bush is saying that his brother Jeb would make a great president.
[00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:23.064]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:23.144 --> 00:04:25.485]  Murdoch defends plan to host Hillary fundraiser.
[00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:27.506]  Calls her effective good senator.
[00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:32.189]  This is out of Human Events, the Neocon publication.
[00:04:33.926 --> 00:04:35.487]  Big USA Today article.
[00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:39.348]  NSA has massive database of all American phone calls.
[00:04:39.388 --> 00:04:40.709]  We told you this ten years ago.
[00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.690]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.191]  We'll be getting into that as well and taking your calls.
[00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:50.834]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:55.015]  I hope you got a comment on this buffet of issues I've laid out, or you can bring up whatever you'd like.
[00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:56.316]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.356 --> 00:04:59.457]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:59.477 --> 00:04:59.898]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.648 --> 00:05:05.491]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.752 --> 00:05:06.453]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:07.334]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:12.360]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.428]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:21.729]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:24.750]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.531]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:34.133]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:41.595]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:44.256]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:46.157]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:03.314]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.674 --> 00:06:09.418]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:14.802]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:24.428]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:29.714]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:34.059]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.005]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:45.312]  The Mercury Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:51.855]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:08.977]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:09.277 --> 00:08:18.900]  World leaders suspect the Bush administration of involvement in 9-11 attacks.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.640]  We've got two different reports on this.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.001]  We'll be getting into it here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:52.463]  But first off, we reported to you yesterday that the Associated Press had reported that the federal government has admitted, and the Mexican government has admitted, that for the last year, every movement of the Minutemen from Texas to Arizona to Southern California, when they're in the field, simply reporting to the Border Patrol, hordes of illegals pouring across and the coyote smugglers that feed upon them, every time they do this, they're being...
[00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:56.027]  We're basically tattled on by our own government.
[00:08:56.968 --> 00:08:57.669]  Meanwhile...
[00:08:59.116 --> 00:08:59.676]  The U.S.
[00:08:59.756 --> 00:09:10.399]  government is federalizing the state police and training them as well as local police that anyone and everyone is basically a terrorist.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.180]  Tattle on anyone and everyone.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.741]  That's the American way.
[00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:23.924]  But if you try to go defend the border by simply calling the police, calling the border patrol, when you see illegal aliens engaging in serious crimes, then you're a vigilante.
[00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:28.005]  Meanwhile, the Mexican government is shooting at our people, shooting at the border patrol.
[00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:37.795]  Killing Border Patrol, killing FBI, killing Forest Service, killing sheriff's deputies, wounding sheriff's deputies, killing American citizens, feeding on the illegal aliens as well.
[00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:39.016]  But that's okay.
[00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:41.239]  Let's relay them all the information.
[00:09:42.401 --> 00:09:46.305]  Here's a report Congressman Tom Tancredo has spoken out on U.S.
[00:09:46.345 --> 00:09:47.606]  surveillance of Minutemen.
[00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:50.069]  Tom Tancredo condemned the U.S.
[00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:53.853]  policy of informing Mexican officials of the location of the U.S.
[00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:57.296]  Minutemen group locations as a matter of course the U.S.
[00:09:57.316 --> 00:10:03.162]  Border Patrol has been charged with advising the Mexican government, divulging the group members' locations,
[00:10:04.644 --> 00:10:12.572]  And it just goes on and on, and helping the Mexican government reroute illegal immigrants entering the United States via its southern border.
[00:10:13.152 --> 00:10:13.833]  Although the U.S.
[00:10:13.873 --> 00:10:25.804]  and Mexican governments say they want to ensure that the illegals' human rights are observed, there has not been any verifiable instance of any member of the Minutemen project affecting violence on any illegal alien.
[00:10:26.562 --> 00:10:32.087]  Representative Tancredo commented, "...the Mexican military doesn't exactly have a good government reputation.
[00:10:32.728 --> 00:10:36.632]  The Border Patrol has documented more than 200 incursions into the U.S.
[00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:48.122]  by the Mexican military, and Texas sheriffs even apprehended Mexican government vehicles that were used to ferry drug runners across the border by tipping off Mexico's military to the Minutemen's location.
[00:10:48.443 --> 00:10:48.863]  The U.S.
[00:10:48.903 --> 00:10:50.705]  government is asking for trouble."
[00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:58.489]  Heavily armed military officials stationed only yards from civilians are at least intimidating.
[00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:06.492]  I can only surmise that the Border Patrol bureaucrats spying is meant to have a chilling effect on the Minutemen's recruiting and more volunteers.
[00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.573]  The Minutemen haven't been accused of breaking the law.
[00:11:09.893 --> 00:11:15.255]  Quite the contrary, they have gone out of their way to aid law enforcement and ensure the safety of our border.
[00:11:15.635 --> 00:11:20.237]  The US government has no grounds upon which to stifle the Minutemen's constitutional rights.
[00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:30.943]  To organize, I want to know the legal basis for the Border Patrol informing a foreign government of the activities of private citizens who are obeying the law.
[00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:33.324]  That's Tom Tancredo's statement in full.
[00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:36.265]  And I totally agree.
[00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:37.126]  Meanwhile,
[00:11:38.095 --> 00:11:49.000]  We have American companies owned by old white men, in one case in the Southern California area, buying over 670 plus billboards, saying that L.A.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.942]  is now Mexico, advertising the nightly Spanish newscast.
[00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:58.905]  Again, this is the establishment selling balkanization to the hordes of illegal aliens.
[00:11:58.965 --> 00:12:03.727]  Now, here's a more balanced report out of Channel 11 up in Dallas that I wanted to critique.
[00:12:04.107 --> 00:12:05.468]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:14.269]  And conservatives are firing back tonight at those who support amnesty in a guest worker program for illegal immigrants.
[00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.734]  Their latest weapon is a billboard located on Stemmons Freeway in Dallas.
[00:12:19.174 --> 00:12:21.677]  CBS 11's Stephanie Lucero tonight has more.
[00:12:22.239 --> 00:12:26.560]  Stop the Invasion is a reference to the massive influx of immigrants who enter the U.S.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.280]  illegally.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.820]  We must stop the invasion.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.901]  We cannot have amnesty because amnesty is, in essence, a surrender to the invasion.
[00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:38.762]  Grassfire.org is a national online organization based in Virginia.
[00:12:39.282 --> 00:12:41.483]  Colby and Jenny Bauer live in Carrollton.
[00:12:41.843 --> 00:12:48.244]  They support the campaign in part because Jenny is a legal resident of the U.S., an immigrant from China.
[00:12:48.664 --> 00:12:50.905]  And I'm living a good life in America.
[00:12:51.025 --> 00:12:55.467]  This is a beautiful country, and I'm thinking everybody should come here legally.
[00:12:55.807 --> 00:12:59.629]  A lot of people would see it as an invasion of immigrants, but it's not.
[00:12:59.669 --> 00:13:01.150]  It's an invasion of illegal immigrants.
[00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.331]  I don't care how many people come here to this country as long as they do it legally.
[00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:06.912]  Grassfire.org is lobbying Congress.
[00:13:07.032 --> 00:13:10.494]  Organizers do not want any form of amnesty in the current debate.
[00:13:11.013 --> 00:13:11.453]  Very impressive.
[00:13:11.513 --> 00:13:15.655]  And I know there's a great majority of people who are on the other side of the issue.
[00:13:41.122 --> 00:13:46.869]  And I, for the life of me, can't fathom why there's not a march for that cause as well.
[00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:49.912]  In Dallas, Stephanie Lucero, CBS 11 News.
[00:13:50.913 --> 00:14:00.804]  Well, that's a fair report, but they don't answer the main question that the American citizens that are supporting grassfire.org raised.
[00:14:01.602 --> 00:14:23.426]  Because there wasn't a fancy Dallas-based PR firm, one of the most powerful in the Western Hemisphere, Rob Allen & Co., that staged the gubernatorial election of George Bush twice, that advised Bush, according to Dallas Morning News, secretly on his presidential run, that helped run the election of Vicente Fox in 2000 as El Presidente of Mexico.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.962]  And they were hired in mid-December.
[00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:29.463]  It was reported in late December.
[00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:38.729]  And they said they were going to stage national demonstrations to defeat legislation that would block amnesty and that would charge these illegal aliens with felony crimes.
[00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.272]  It's already a felony, but it was going to add a new layer to that.
[00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:44.139]  We're good to go.
[00:15:07.108 --> 00:15:07.989]  That's why it happened.
[00:15:08.029 --> 00:15:27.219]  I mean, if the English-speaking press for three months, every day, morning, noon, and night, told everybody that on a certain date, wear white and be out there demonstrating for your raza, for your honor, for your race, a day without gringo, as it was openly advertised, the AP even reported that they were not called a day without immigrants.
[00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:30.561]  The real name in the banner said a day without gringos, the official name.
[00:15:31.501 --> 00:15:34.063]  A very, very racist, very, very serious...
[00:15:34.771 --> 00:15:36.392]  And so there's the answer to your question.
[00:15:36.412 --> 00:15:44.754]  If CNN, Fox, all your local stations, ABC, Nightly News, CBS, NBC, if they constantly had reports, you'd have 50 million people on the streets.
[00:15:45.114 --> 00:15:48.515]  But they always make fun of demonstrators, whether they're conservative or liberal.
[00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:51.676]  They're always shown with riot police around them like they're bad.
[00:15:51.696 --> 00:15:55.177]  Arrests are always made and televised as a chilling effect.
[00:15:55.717 --> 00:15:59.078]  American citizens getting involved politically is discouraged.
[00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:08.211]  But the 25 million illegal aliens in this country are getting involved politically and bullying the cowed American people is encouraged.
[00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:11.614]  So that's what's happening there.
[00:16:12.655 --> 00:16:18.901]  Meanwhile, at the grassroots, President Bush's agenda is in horrible trouble.
[00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:29.642]  The vast majority of Americans, 90 plus percent now, it was 87 percent, now it's 90 plus percent in major polls, are against the open borders and the illegal aliens pouring in.
[00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:36.168]  Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports, hardcore GO peers flee Bush pollsters fine.
[00:16:36.668 --> 00:16:45.335]  Dissatisfaction over spending and immigration have caused conservatives to take flight from President Bush, and the Republican Congress at a rapid pace in recent weeks.
[00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:59.104]  Sending President Bush's approval ratings to record lows and presenting a new threat to the GOP's 12-year reign on Capitol Hill, according to White House officials, lawmakers, and polling data.
[00:16:59.584 --> 00:17:10.848]  Bush and Congress have suffered a decline in support from almost every part of the conservative coalition over the past year, a trend that has accelerated with alarming implications of Bush's governing policy.
[00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:12.269]  Yeah, saying he's above the law.
[00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:19.806]  The Gallup polling organization reported a 13 percentage point drop in Republican support for President Bush in the past couple of weeks.
[00:17:19.826 --> 00:17:21.027]  He's in free fall right now.
[00:17:21.627 --> 00:17:22.108]  Be afraid.
[00:17:22.228 --> 00:17:23.108]  Be very afraid.
[00:17:23.148 --> 00:17:25.270]  If they were ever going to launch a terror attack, it'd be now.
[00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.511]  So we learn to love them again.
[00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:29.613]  Oh, be our Savior's government.
[00:17:30.143 --> 00:17:37.148]  But see, there's such a grass fire, excuse the pun, awareness growing of government-sponsored terror that that won't even work.
[00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:44.332]  It'll work short term, but like a heroin addict who's so addicted, he has to take more and more for less and less effect.
[00:17:45.753 --> 00:17:55.420]  These usually reliable voters are telling pollsters and lawmakers they are fed up with what they see as an out-of-control spending by Washington, an abandonment of core conservative principles.
[00:17:56.064 --> 00:17:56.724]  We're good to go.
[00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:20.095]  And a governing model that was predicted and predicated on winning and sustaining the loyal backing of conservatives.
[00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:28.259]  The theory, as explained by Bush strategists, is that the president would enjoy a floor below which his support would never fall.
[00:18:28.991 --> 00:18:33.473]  It is now apparent that that floor is weakening dramatically and collapsing in many places.
[00:18:33.993 --> 00:18:42.597]  A lot of us have been, like Paul Revere, and sounding the alarm for three or four years of Representative Tom Feeney, Republican out of Florida.
[00:18:43.098 --> 00:18:50.941]  Conservatives forgive Bush and Congress for the past mistakes because the war on terrorism was so important, but now there is a great deal of unhappiness.
[00:18:51.522 --> 00:18:55.664]  What you are going to increasingly see is a divided Republican Party.
[00:18:56.204 --> 00:18:56.344]  Now,
[00:18:58.362 --> 00:19:01.783]  There's a bunch of other Republican articles going, Boo-hoo!
[00:19:02.323 --> 00:19:04.664]  Oh, Republicans are about to be taught a lesson.
[00:19:04.724 --> 00:19:06.725]  Republicans are about to lose the Congress.
[00:19:07.385 --> 00:19:09.386]  That is the staged plan.
[00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:19.149]  There's a reason that Rush Limbaugh's owner, Roger Ailes, head of Fox News, and the owner of Fox, Rupert Murdoch, have weekly meetings with Hillary.
[00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:21.470]  There's a reason George Bush Sr.
[00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:27.292]  calls Bill Clinton his son and they vacation together and reportedly spend more time with Bill Clinton than they do with George.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.941]  I'm not kidding.
[00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:30.302]  That's mainstream news.
[00:19:30.942 --> 00:19:32.523]  This is all staged.
[00:19:32.644 --> 00:19:36.126]  It's always been staged since they blew Kennedy's head off back in 1963.
[00:19:36.246 --> 00:19:40.029]  And that's what's going on right now.
[00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.613]  And conservatives are finally finding out that George Bush is more anti-gun than Bill Clinton.
[00:19:45.234 --> 00:19:46.635]  More open border than Bill Clinton.
[00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:51.579]  And they're now trying to sell us as Hillary as the new savior.
[00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:52.920]  This is ridiculous.
[00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:54.716]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.756 --> 00:20:00.441]  We'll take your calls, get into a bunch of other news concerning world leaders fingering our government for 9-11.
[00:20:02.082 --> 00:20:05.685]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:20:05.925 --> 00:20:06.806]  Look no further.
[00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:09.649]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:18.616]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:20:18.756 --> 00:20:20.458]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[00:20:20.738 --> 00:20:21.339]  We're good to go.
[00:20:36.297 --> 00:20:36.697]  We're good to go.
[00:20:36.717 --> 00:20:37.158]  We're good to go.
[00:20:37.178 --> 00:20:37.538]  We're good to go.
[00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:09.620]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:10.081 --> 00:21:10.781]  One and the same.
[00:21:11.522 --> 00:21:15.525]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:15.965 --> 00:21:17.567]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:18.087]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:18.127 --> 00:21:20.209]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:31.943 --> 00:21:32.483]  We're good to go.
[00:21:32.543 --> 00:21:33.464]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:10.517]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.

[00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:31.674]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled, and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:22:31.834 --> 00:22:33.715]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:39.918]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:22:40.178 --> 00:22:45.841]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:23:01.994 --> 00:23:03.176]  So you take care of your car.
[00:23:03.336 --> 00:23:04.177]  You change the oil.
[00:23:04.357 --> 00:23:05.699]  Tune it up on a regular basis.
[00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:07.961]  And always make sure that it's running at its best.
[00:23:08.162 --> 00:23:10.524]  When it comes to your car, you demand performance.
[00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:14.069]  That's why you need SFR's Protecta synthetic oil treatments.
[00:23:14.289 --> 00:23:15.370]  Protecta engine treatment.

[00:24:04.036 --> 00:24:10.078]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.678 --> 00:24:13.639]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.989]  All right, let's do this.
[00:24:22.009 --> 00:24:28.990]  Let's run through a bunch of your calls right now quickly, then we'll come back and get into world leaders suspect Bush administration of involvement in 9-11 attacks.
[00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:29.831]  That's the headline.
[00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:32.711]  Right now, let's go to Jason in Maryland.
[00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:33.711]  Jason, you're on the air.
[00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:34.111]  Welcome.
[00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:34.991]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:48.194]  I was wondering if you saw Rumsfeld being questioned last week when the woman did the protest and got prosecuted under the Patriot Act.
[00:24:49.394 --> 00:24:49.634]  Yes.
[00:24:51.032 --> 00:25:03.819]  I was wondering if you could comment on the CIA man who was doing the questioning and Rumsfeld's non-answer.
[00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:05.380]  Sure, let me comment on that.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.521]  Thanks for the call, Jason.
[00:25:08.222 --> 00:25:11.103]  Well, we interviewed the Chinese-American doctor.
[00:25:11.123 --> 00:25:12.424]  She's a transplant doctor.
[00:25:13.241 --> 00:25:22.649]  Who's been exposing the fact that they murder political dissidents, Falun Gong and others, Christians as well, and sell their organs in the world market and advertise it.
[00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:24.250]  It's not hidden.
[00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:30.435]  And then our media tries to spin it and make excuses and act like it's not documented.
[00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:32.017]  They don't deny it.
[00:25:32.037 --> 00:25:35.600]  They just say, oh, they're investigating when the Chinese government advertises it.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.162]  And she got up and spoke out.
[00:25:39.134 --> 00:25:49.797]  During their little speech they were giving, slash press conference, and she began to shout that they were engaging in mass murder and killing people for their organs, and that the Communist Party's days were numbered.
[00:25:50.497 --> 00:26:06.762]  And so they then arrested her and charged her, not only with disorderly conduct, but also intimidating a foreign official, a provision of the Patriot Act, and she's facing six months to a year in prison, and will lose her voting rights, will lose her Second Amendment,
[00:26:07.802 --> 00:26:09.943]  It shows how America is becoming just like China.
[00:26:11.343 --> 00:26:25.147]  Then, what was it, last Monday, Ray McGovern, a routine guest of this broadcast, high-level CIA advisor to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr., gave them both their morning briefings for eight years, a part of Reagan and then the rest of Bush's one term.
[00:26:27.024 --> 00:26:31.246]  He stood up during question and answer, and others were heckling at the same time.
[00:26:31.286 --> 00:26:32.687]  They were arrested and drug out.
[00:26:33.227 --> 00:26:34.267]  McGovern wasn't.
[00:26:34.368 --> 00:26:49.134]  Security were beginning to put their hands on him, and Rumsfeld said, no, no, let him stay, let him talk for just a minute, for just a second, was his quote, because he knew how bad it looked here in America that they staged these town halls, they staged these meetings.
[00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:53.816]  At many of Cheney's and Bush's town hall meetings they've had the last few years, and especially during 2004,
[00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:55.878]  We're good to go.
[00:27:11.108 --> 00:27:14.871]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in New York.
[00:27:14.891 --> 00:27:15.512]  You're on the air.
[00:27:15.552 --> 00:27:15.872]  Welcome.
[00:27:16.293 --> 00:27:17.774]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:18.955]  Appreciate it.
[00:27:19.315 --> 00:27:27.402]  Yesterday, we get this advertisement newspaper that comes in our mail, and I happen to be looking at it, and on page two...
[00:27:28.468 --> 00:27:32.849]  It's got the big words announcement and prog letters right in the center of the page.
[00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:38.011]  It says volunteers needed for an investigational bird flu vaccine study.
[00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:45.193]  And then the criteria, you have to be 65 and up, in good health, and the payment's up to $320.
[00:27:47.253 --> 00:27:49.696]  And paid parking, eight study visits.
[00:27:49.756 --> 00:27:52.420]  Yeah, what they're studying is, does this kill old people?
[00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:53.381]  Oh, yeah.
[00:27:53.601 --> 00:27:54.503]  Oh, without a doubt.
[00:27:54.563 --> 00:27:59.890]  It's got, of course, the phone number, and it's University of Rochester Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit.
[00:28:00.611 --> 00:28:01.412]  So here we go.
[00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.512]  We're good to go.
[00:28:18.052 --> 00:28:18.812]  Well, we have a government...
[00:28:41.477 --> 00:28:41.797]  I agree.
[00:28:41.817 --> 00:28:49.764]  We have a government that's been caught engaging in eugenics for over 80 years in this country, putting things in vaccines, poisoning, radiating children.
[00:28:50.344 --> 00:28:52.566]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:28:53.427 --> 00:28:56.509]  And we're supposed to then trust them and take vaccines they're pushing.
[00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:59.952]  Meanwhile, they haven't taken the mercury out.
[00:29:00.332 --> 00:29:03.114]  Even the Associated Press reports, they've actually increased it.
[00:29:03.514 --> 00:29:06.597]  So that's an urban legend that they have removed it.
[00:29:06.977 --> 00:29:14.424]  And then they have all these made-for-TV movies and newscasts about how the bird flu's coming, it's going to kill billions, it's going to kill millions domestically.
[00:29:14.764 --> 00:29:17.766]  Just give up all your rights and martial law will keep you safe.
[00:29:18.227 --> 00:29:24.472]  Well, you know, here's another thing that I've been hearing, too, that they're saying, you know, it's in their plans that...
[00:29:26.501 --> 00:29:27.522]  Are you there, Alex?
[00:29:27.862 --> 00:29:28.542]  Yes, I am, sir.
[00:29:28.602 --> 00:29:28.962]  Okay.
[00:29:30.183 --> 00:29:32.364]  I know I heard music in the background.
[00:29:32.444 --> 00:29:43.008]  In their plans, they've even said if you don't take it, you're not going to be able to get on public transportation, you won't be able to fly, you can't go to sporting events because you don't have your vaccine.
[00:29:43.128 --> 00:29:43.548]  I know.
[00:29:43.668 --> 00:29:44.789]  It's the new tyranny.
[00:29:44.849 --> 00:29:46.669]  It's a new medical tyranny.
[00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:47.870]  I'll comment on it when we get back.
[00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:48.430]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:51.992 --> 00:29:52.912]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.392 --> 00:29:54.893]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.905 --> 00:29:58.666]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.387 --> 00:30:05.028]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:30:05.449 --> 00:30:14.892]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C.
[00:30:15.512 --> 00:30:17.753]  and therefore bypass the state governments?
[00:30:18.634 --> 00:30:21.975]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.,
[00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:23.656]  We're good to go.
[00:30:38.431 --> 00:30:39.933]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[00:30:59.223 --> 00:31:02.807]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:02.847 --> 00:31:03.347]  are located?
[00:31:03.548 --> 00:31:06.931]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:32:00.017 --> 00:32:02.580]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.903]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:05.183 --> 00:32:15.295]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[00:32:15.595 --> 00:32:17.918]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:51.126]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:32:51.146 --> 00:32:52.927]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.891 --> 00:33:13.814]  We've got some guests on from Japan coming up in the next hour.
[00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:27.185]  Wrote a big article for one of the large publications in Tokyo, one of the big newspapers, about 9-11 and inside operations by our own loving, benevolent government.
[00:33:27.245 --> 00:33:28.326]  So that is coming up.
[00:33:28.346 --> 00:33:29.587]  We're going to go back to your calls.
[00:33:30.547 --> 00:33:32.788]  And a lot more here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:32.808 --> 00:33:37.931]  But I want to get into world leaders suspect the Bush administration of involvement in the 9-11 attacks.
[00:33:37.991 --> 00:33:45.636]  But before I go any further, I want to really encourage all of you to put your ears on and grab a pen and paper.
[00:33:46.716 --> 00:33:59.604]  Because coming up June 24th and 25th in downtown Los Angeles, California, we're going to be having a 9-11 truth symposium unlike any other you've seen.
[00:34:00.402 --> 00:34:07.706]  We're going to have Professor Stephen Jones from BYU University, physics professor on the controlled demolition of the towers.
[00:34:07.726 --> 00:34:12.849]  We're going to have the head of the 9-11 Scholars for Truth, Professor Jim Fetzer.
[00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:20.193]  We're going to have Webster Tarpley, author of 9-11 Synthetic Terror, made in the USA, a book I carry, by the way, that's excellent.
[00:34:20.693 --> 00:34:23.114]  Of course, I'm going to be speaking and giving a presentation.
[00:34:23.134 --> 00:34:28.017]  I'm going to be premiering, right when the conference starts, my new film.
[00:34:28.886 --> 00:34:30.848]  And I believe we have the new name of the film.
[00:34:30.908 --> 00:34:36.235]  I'm 90% sure we're going to be titling it Terror Storm.
[00:34:37.136 --> 00:34:40.159]  Right now it looks like that's going to be the name.
[00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:42.001]  Somebody in my office came up with that name.
[00:34:42.822 --> 00:34:44.544]  I've been struggling with the new name.
[00:34:44.584 --> 00:34:45.806]  That film is almost done.
[00:34:45.826 --> 00:34:47.147]  It is my best work yet.
[00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:49.330]  We're just doing the music for it right now.
[00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:56.237]  And there are going to be some other surprise guests that are going to be popping in as well.
[00:34:56.938 --> 00:35:00.362]  And so you can go see the itinerary and who's speaking and who's signed up.
[00:35:00.402 --> 00:35:05.469]  We're going to hear Loose Change 2 and some new little things that Dylan Avery has been working on as well.
[00:35:05.529 --> 00:35:06.591]  So it's a film festival.
[00:35:07.952 --> 00:35:09.973]  Truth Scholars Symposium.
[00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:11.413]  You do not want to miss it.
[00:35:11.493 --> 00:35:20.955]  In June 2006, researchers, scholars, journalists, media personalities, and average folks will come together from all over the USA to gather in Los Angeles to invite the rest of the world to examine the facts of 9-11.
[00:35:22.735 --> 00:35:35.418]  Through powerful and insightful presentations and prominent guest speakers and riveting documentary screenings, we will examine the neocon agenda in 9-11 as the pretext for the brutal ongoing war in Iraq as well as the establishment's future plans.
[00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:35.838]  The event...
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:47.342]  Can be billed as two days of truth, and it is a challenge to the establishment mouthpiece media to resolutely defend the government fairytale version of what happens on that fateful day.
[00:35:47.582 --> 00:35:51.883]  Again, it's a challenge to the establishment mouthpiece media that continues to defend the fraud.
[00:35:52.403 --> 00:36:02.325]  The conference will witness the premiere of my newest and most powerful film, which largely focuses on the 7-7 bombings, 9-11, and government-sponsored tyranny throughout America.
[00:36:02.865 --> 00:36:03.406]  We're good to go.
[00:36:17.478 --> 00:36:17.978]  We're good to go.
[00:36:39.292 --> 00:36:48.058]  And, of course, you can get a room at the Sheraton if you'd like, or they have more expensive or less expensive motels and hotels, really by the hundreds in that area.
[00:36:48.138 --> 00:36:52.621]  I mean, just in a few square miles, there's over 15 hotels and motels.
[00:36:53.022 --> 00:36:54.543]  The Sheraton downtown L.A.
[00:36:54.643 --> 00:36:58.765]  is built onto a modern shopping mall with a food court and five restaurants.
[00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:05.190]  The hotel has three restaurants, so it's going to be a great place to hold this event.
[00:37:06.385 --> 00:37:16.272]  We're also going to shoot video of the entire presentation and then make a documentary out of that with quick turnaround to get the truth out to the American people.
[00:37:16.312 --> 00:37:19.575]  So this is something that you definitely do not want to miss.
[00:37:19.715 --> 00:37:23.238]  And we're having this on the 24th and 25th.
[00:37:23.318 --> 00:37:25.519]  It's only the 11th today.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.122]  So we're talking about, what, 19 days and then another 25.
[00:37:33.638 --> 00:37:36.079]  We're good to go.
[00:37:36.099 --> 00:37:36.499]  We're good to go.
[00:37:53.286 --> 00:37:56.587]  And so you don't have to have a computer to go online to get the tickets.
[00:37:56.627 --> 00:38:01.408]  The tickets then are emailed back to you, e-tickets, with your ticket number on them as your receipt.
[00:38:01.428 --> 00:38:04.589]  You just show that at the door and you'll get a wristband.
[00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:11.871]  Or you can simply write to us for the next few weeks and we will mail you out a ticket.
[00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:13.291]  Or you can call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:13.311 --> 00:38:13.791]  Don't wait.
[00:38:13.811 --> 00:38:16.412]  This is going to be a really exciting event.
[00:38:22.373 --> 00:38:24.475]  You'll want to be sure and attend it.
[00:38:24.815 --> 00:38:26.576]  I look forward to meeting you and shaking your hand.
[00:38:26.596 --> 00:38:27.797]  We'll also have some of my films.
[00:38:28.498 --> 00:38:32.481]  We'll have an event t-shirt that we offer for a low price that will be there as well.
[00:38:32.781 --> 00:38:35.303]  So you'll be able to get a t-shirt to remember the event.
[00:38:35.703 --> 00:38:36.824]  It's going to be really exciting.
[00:38:36.844 --> 00:38:38.785]  I've never done an event this big before.
[00:38:38.805 --> 00:38:41.027]  It's taken a lot of work behind the scenes.
[00:38:41.287 --> 00:38:43.128]  There will be a lot of surprises at the event.
[00:38:43.429 --> 00:38:46.371]  Believe me, you'll be wishing later you'd gone if you don't.
[00:38:46.831 --> 00:38:50.614]  So that's coming up the 24th and 25th of next month in June.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.222]  And tickets are available at Infowars.com right now.
[00:38:54.242 --> 00:39:07.292]  You just link through to AmericanScholarSymposium.org via Infowars.com and you can get them off the big mainline, mainstream establishment ticket system, Tix.com, that we are using.
[00:39:08.149 --> 00:39:09.369]  So don't delay.
[00:39:09.529 --> 00:39:10.429]  There'll be a rush.
[00:39:10.529 --> 00:39:11.510]  There's already been a rush.
[00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:16.211]  I think we're doing pretty good to sell 200 tickets in five days, six days.
[00:39:17.011 --> 00:39:21.091]  But we've got almost 40 days left, and you're going to wish that you got tickets.
[00:39:21.511 --> 00:39:24.632]  I mean, if we don't completely sell out, we'll have tickets at the door for you as well.
[00:39:24.672 --> 00:39:29.493]  But I don't think I've ever had an event, in fact, I haven't, where you can get tickets at the door.
[00:39:29.513 --> 00:39:30.193]  Well, that's not true.
[00:39:30.253 --> 00:39:34.134]  One time I had a showing in Houston of Road to Tyranny, and we only filled about 90% of the audience.
[00:39:35.154 --> 00:39:42.497]  Because I didn't really promote it, but every other event, and there have been probably 15 of them or so, more than that, really, have all sold out beforehand.
[00:39:42.857 --> 00:39:45.718]  So if you want to go, be sure and go to Infowars.com and get your tickets.
[00:39:46.458 --> 00:39:48.359]  Let's say you've got family in Southern California.
[00:39:48.379 --> 00:39:50.060]  That's right around summer vacation time.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.602]  Go to this event and spend time with family or go to the beach or Universal Studios or whatever floats your boat.
[00:39:56.295 --> 00:39:57.476]  And just have a great time.
[00:39:57.516 --> 00:39:58.557]  It's going to be exciting.
[00:39:58.757 --> 00:39:59.598]  Two days of truth.
[00:39:59.999 --> 00:40:01.440]  Face the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.083]  We'll be throwing the gauntlet down to the mainstream media to face the facts.
[00:40:05.544 --> 00:40:06.625]  So it's going to be a circus.
[00:40:06.665 --> 00:40:07.446]  Hope to see you there.
[00:40:08.126 --> 00:40:14.512]  Tell you what, let's just get some more of these calls out of the way, and then I'll get to world leaders suspect the Bush administration of involvement in 9-11 attacks.
[00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:16.474]  Then we'll go to our guest from Tokyo.
[00:40:17.015 --> 00:40:19.557]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Texas.
[00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:20.258]  Bob, go ahead.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.080]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:22.840]  Good.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.121]  I'm in your hometown here.
[00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:30.783]  I just wanted to know, have you seen the Homeland Security billboards they have in Oak Hill and out by the airport?
[00:40:31.183 --> 00:40:31.743]  No, I haven't.
[00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:38.845]  They say, it's a big white sign, and in red letters it says, READY, which is real big.
[00:40:38.905 --> 00:40:39.985]  Oh, I've seen those, yeah.
[00:40:40.505 --> 00:40:41.265]  Don't be afraid.
[00:40:41.365 --> 00:40:41.906]  Be ready.
[00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.166]  www.ready.gov.
[00:40:44.726 --> 00:40:47.087]  If you go to that website and you look at it,
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.885]  It is telling you how to buckle your house down in case of a nuclear or biological attack.
[00:40:55.426 --> 00:40:59.349]  And if that's not in your face, and I live out no kill, right?
[00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:03.533]  Yeah, they're training us how to stay in our houses when they have their martial law takeover.
[00:41:03.573 --> 00:41:05.314]  New Orleans was a beta test.
[00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:12.920]  Well, they're teaching you how to take the plastic and how to duct tape the whole room off to stay safe in there, how much water you need to have.
[00:41:13.381 --> 00:41:17.044]  They have games that your children can play on there, teaching them how to
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.463]  Make sure you have the duct tape and you have the water and you have the food supply.
[00:41:22.084 --> 00:41:23.745]  It's just really sick.
[00:41:23.805 --> 00:41:28.309]  And anyways, I just want to let you know that there's a billboard in Oak Hill and there's one right out by the airport.
[00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:30.030]  No, I figured it was something new.
[00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.011]  I mean, I saw those.
[00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:32.592]  Those have been up for almost three years.
[00:41:33.413 --> 00:41:34.073]  Have they really?
[00:41:34.774 --> 00:41:36.695]  Yeah, I've seen them driving out at the airport.
[00:41:36.996 --> 00:41:38.237]  That's the same one you're talking about.
[00:41:38.277 --> 00:41:38.997]  It says ready.
[00:41:39.678 --> 00:41:40.959]  Don't be afraid.
[00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:41.700]  Be ready.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.401]  And then I've seen them around the country.
[00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:44.214]  Awesome.
[00:41:44.254 --> 00:41:45.295]  Have a wonderful day, man.
[00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:46.657]  I appreciate your call.
[00:41:47.077 --> 00:41:51.461]  Meanwhile, Homeland Security leaves the border completely wide open and is busy training.
[00:41:52.404 --> 00:41:56.766]  The feds, the state governments, the schools, the colleges, all over the nation.
[00:41:56.786 --> 00:41:58.267]  They have Homeland Security training.
[00:41:58.287 --> 00:42:00.248]  We've had some of their minions on the show.
[00:42:00.288 --> 00:42:04.250]  In one case out of Knoxville, this top professor who runs the program.
[00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:11.214]  And they admittedly have the citizens training to tattle on neighbors and spy on everyone.
[00:42:11.234 --> 00:42:15.456]  But then the Minutemen on the border reporting hordes of illegal aliens.
[00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:16.637]  We're good to go.
[00:42:37.205 --> 00:42:39.326]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:42:39.426 --> 00:42:40.267]  Jeff in Mass.
[00:42:40.327 --> 00:42:40.927]  Jeff, welcome.
[00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:41.667]  Oh, yes.
[00:42:41.927 --> 00:42:47.010]  That is so traitorous what our government is doing, giving the information over to the government of Mexico.
[00:42:47.570 --> 00:43:05.779]  Now, I'm just wondering whether the minds of the people, like Tapioca, because on one hand, we're in the Middle East fighting the war on terror, and on the other hand, our borders are wide open, and on the other hand, we both know that it was our own government that brought down the buildings on September 11th, but even if you were to take
[00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:17.377]  The official story of 19 Muslims flying a plane into that building, according to what they have to say, those Muslims came in on expired visas.
[00:43:17.817 --> 00:43:19.639]  I mean, what's that government trying to do?
[00:43:19.699 --> 00:43:23.962]  Turn people's brains into tapioca and people buying the tapioca?
[00:43:24.002 --> 00:43:29.206]  Well, and then six months after 9-11, remember, they reissued Muhammad Atta's visa for him?
[00:43:30.246 --> 00:43:30.767]  Wow.
[00:43:30.927 --> 00:43:32.008]  Do you remember that scandal?
[00:43:32.828 --> 00:43:33.589]  No, I don't.
[00:43:34.762 --> 00:43:40.907]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, they're telling us to spy on our neighbors, but don't watch the border.
[00:43:41.507 --> 00:43:42.388]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:42.608 --> 00:43:44.369]  That's the tip-off right there.
[00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:56.218]  An open, porous border, and Bush just going headlong into globalism, and people are still saying that Bush is a Christian, Bush is a Christian, but Bush has not renounced his membership in the Skull and Bones.
[00:43:56.699 --> 00:44:02.363]  Do you think the people in this country are nothing but a bunch of sheeple that just want a full belly and a shelter over their heads?
[00:44:03.869 --> 00:44:04.910]  I appreciate your call.
[00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.431]  I think it's more than that.
[00:44:06.951 --> 00:44:11.894]  I think it's a lot more sophisticated than just that, but I think that predominantly is the majority of the problem.
[00:44:11.914 --> 00:44:30.904]  I mean, they have the big National Geography Association every year, has a big study of young adults, 18 to 24, college students and graduates, people that are graduating, that age range, and two-thirds can't find Iraq, can't find Iran, even higher numbers can't find Pakistan.
[00:44:31.485 --> 00:44:33.506]  They have no earthly conception of anything.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:34.800]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.842]  I wanted to tell you about an experience I had last Friday.
[00:44:55.344 --> 00:45:04.192]  My girlfriend and I went to United 93, and we actually brought 50 Loose Change second edition DVDs with us.
[00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:14.081]  Anyway, we waited for the show to get out, and this particular theater was set up where there was basically one choke point where there was one exit that people were leaving.
[00:45:14.381 --> 00:45:17.484]  Well, I'm glad you did that, but I wish you'd hand out a few martial laws, too.
[00:45:18.465 --> 00:45:20.728]  I'm sorry, we're having problems burning it.
[00:45:20.908 --> 00:45:22.129]  We just started DVD burning it.
[00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:24.852]  I think because it's extra long, we're having problems with our own.
[00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:26.113]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:45:26.394 --> 00:45:31.119]  It's three hours long, but you have to buy larger DVDs.
[00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:34.863]  There's a special DVD that will let you burn it, and it's only a little bit more.
[00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:36.812]  We're going to get into that.
[00:45:36.852 --> 00:45:38.213]  Actually, we have an old server.
[00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:44.636]  We run a software company, actually, so we're sitting here all day, and we have an old server where we're going to put six drive bays in there and just start cranking them out.
[00:45:44.676 --> 00:45:45.837]  So we're going to look into it.
[00:45:45.897 --> 00:45:47.878]  And listen, I commend you giving out loose change, too.
[00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.280]  I just think martial law really needs to be seen.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:51.481]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:45:51.561 --> 00:45:52.541]  I wish we could have burned them.
[00:45:52.581 --> 00:45:56.404]  We will eventually once we get set up and we have our little server up and running here.
[00:45:56.424 --> 00:45:58.065]  But get back to your story.
[00:45:58.105 --> 00:45:58.965]  I'm sorry for interrupting.
[00:45:59.485 --> 00:46:00.366]  Okay, no problem.
[00:46:01.255 --> 00:46:06.436]  Anyway, we actually got a pretty good reaction, because my friend did this at a different theater, and he got a pretty bad one.
[00:46:06.456 --> 00:46:10.257]  But everybody was taking the DVDs as they were walking by me.
[00:46:10.277 --> 00:46:12.498]  I just said, here's some more information on 9-11.
[00:46:12.538 --> 00:46:13.438]  Great movie, great movie.
[00:46:13.978 --> 00:46:15.418]  Just take this and watch for me, please.
[00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:18.459]  And most people, they took the DVD and they said, thank you, thank you.
[00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:22.440]  Now, I had this one guy, and this is why I'm going, because this reaction puzzles me.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.801]  There's this one guy, and he said, what kind of information?
[00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:30.002]  I said, well, just, you know, some more information, you know, government prior knowledge, you
[00:46:30.701 --> 00:46:34.463]  As soon as I start saying that, he instantly gives it back to me and says, no, thank you.
[00:46:34.883 --> 00:46:37.044]  And he starts walking away, and I guess it was his wife.
[00:46:37.424 --> 00:46:41.906]  She starts saying, what are your sources for your information?
[00:46:41.946 --> 00:46:45.408]  I'm like, well, just mainstream sources, CNN, ABC, CBS.
[00:46:45.528 --> 00:46:48.209]  And then she says, CNN lies.
[00:46:48.249 --> 00:46:53.792]  And both of them, the guy who gave me the bad reaction, and I'm assuming his wife, they stormed out of the theater.
[00:46:54.252 --> 00:46:55.753]  Meanwhile, I'm still handing out DVDs.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:04.725]  A couple of people whom I missed because there were so many people coming out actually went behind me and stopped me and said, hey, give me a copy too, people that I missed.
[00:47:05.385 --> 00:47:09.227]  About five people did that, so that was an extra good reaction from them.
[00:47:10.568 --> 00:47:20.614]  What I wanted to get to is this guy that gave me the bad reaction actually went and got the manager of the theater, and the manager comes in there with a cop, and by this time the whole theater is cleared out.
[00:47:21.897 --> 00:47:24.880]  Except it's just me, and I told my girlfriend just to get out of there.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.322]  And now you've already handed out your 50 DVDs.
[00:47:28.702 --> 00:47:31.084]  Yes, at this point, luckily, I didn't even have a single one left.
[00:47:32.205 --> 00:47:39.390]  So this manager comes in here with a police officer, and they start saying, you can't solicit it here.
[00:47:39.935 --> 00:47:40.295]  You can't.
[00:47:40.595 --> 00:47:42.296]  Yeah, basically, there's no solicitation in this theater.
[00:47:42.316 --> 00:47:43.837]  I said, well, I'm not soliciting anything.
[00:47:43.917 --> 00:47:46.458]  I would have just said, I don't know what you're talking about, and walked right past him.
[00:47:46.678 --> 00:47:48.719]  It's funny, because that's exactly what I said.
[00:47:49.019 --> 00:47:49.879]  Because I didn't have any DVDs.
[00:47:49.939 --> 00:47:50.959]  I said, I don't have any DVDs.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.421]  And then at this point, the officer, I don't remember exactly what he said, but he said, you know what?
[00:47:55.441 --> 00:47:56.582]  I can take you to jail right now.
[00:47:57.302 --> 00:47:59.123]  And I said, well, go ahead and arrest me.
[00:47:59.203 --> 00:48:01.704]  I'm going to call your boss, and it's not going to be good for you at all.
[00:48:02.244 --> 00:48:04.345]  And the most important thing is that guy...
[00:48:05.335 --> 00:48:08.098]  That had a bad reaction to me handing these DVDs out.
[00:48:08.358 --> 00:48:14.845]  He actually went back in there with the manager and he was standing off probably about 20 feet away because he actually came in just to see me.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.082]  He wanted to see what my fate was.
[00:48:17.122 --> 00:48:18.543]  He wanted to see me getting yelled at.
[00:48:18.583 --> 00:48:20.245]  No, no, he wants to live in Russia.
[00:48:20.285 --> 00:48:21.446]  He wants to live in China.
[00:48:21.506 --> 00:48:22.707]  He hates America.
[00:48:23.108 --> 00:48:26.231]  He loves it that that Chinese-American doctor got arrested.
[00:48:26.592 --> 00:48:28.414]  He loves it that we're losing our freedoms.
[00:48:28.454 --> 00:48:29.435]  He's a bootlicker.
[00:48:29.835 --> 00:48:34.860]  He associates his personal power and his personal identity with this corrupt system.
[00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:37.263]  And so what ended up happening?
[00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:39.725]  The cop ended up being okay.
[00:48:39.745 --> 00:48:43.568]  I mean, after I started getting attitude with him, he found out that I wasn't just a moron that was going to get arrested.
[00:48:43.588 --> 00:48:44.529]  Then he'd be back down.
[00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:46.250]  Well, number one, you don't lie to him.
[00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:47.011]  You just don't say anything.
[00:48:47.031 --> 00:48:48.352]  You go, hey, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:49.052]  Have a nice day.
[00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:50.313]  You just walk past him.
[00:48:51.154 --> 00:48:52.275]  That probably would have been good, yeah.
[00:48:52.455 --> 00:48:53.736]  So what happened?
[00:48:53.776 --> 00:48:57.099]  And the other thing, too, when this guy was standing 20 feet away, I looked over and I saw him.
[00:48:58.019 --> 00:49:01.062]  And I start not yelling at him, but I yelled out so he could hear me.
[00:49:01.102 --> 00:49:03.944]  I said, hey, do you even know what the First Amendment is?
[00:49:04.522 --> 00:49:05.863]  And he just stands there and looks at me dumb.
[00:49:06.204 --> 00:49:10.969]  And after I asked him about three more times, he finally said, freedom of speech, but that doesn't apply because this is private property.
[00:49:11.429 --> 00:49:12.250]  And then I kept going.
[00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:13.611]  I said, what does NORAD stand for?
[00:49:14.032 --> 00:49:15.453]  I said, how about the Director of Homeland Security?
[00:49:15.493 --> 00:49:15.994]  Who is that?
[00:49:16.214 --> 00:49:17.675]  And he just stands there with a dumb look on his face.
[00:49:18.056 --> 00:49:25.984]  So my point is this guy doesn't have a clue about any information at all, but he's going to criticize me, and he doesn't even know what my information is.
[00:49:26.004 --> 00:49:27.926]  I mean, it puzzles me, this reaction.
[00:49:28.943 --> 00:49:32.405]  It's kind of like that guy that was on your show that got beat up in the VFW Hall.
[00:49:32.505 --> 00:49:37.289]  These people are having an angry reaction, and they don't even know any information for themselves.
[00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:38.469]  They don't even know what the guy's talking about.
[00:49:38.489 --> 00:49:40.350]  I agree.
[00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:41.751]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:49:41.851 --> 00:49:42.732]  Good job, sir.
[00:49:42.792 --> 00:49:43.613]  I want to commend you.
[00:49:43.653 --> 00:49:45.574]  You keep doing what you're doing.
[00:49:46.824 --> 00:49:55.229]  That's got to scare the New World Order, because I personally know a lot of Austinites that have gone out and handed out my film and other films at these events.
[00:49:55.469 --> 00:49:58.651]  I personally know other people in other cities that are doing it.
[00:49:58.671 --> 00:49:59.992]  I get calls every day about it.
[00:50:00.092 --> 00:50:00.752]  I hear about it.
[00:50:01.112 --> 00:50:02.033]  It's been in the news.
[00:50:02.113 --> 00:50:03.434]  It's been on national TV.
[00:50:03.874 --> 00:50:15.781]  That all over the place at these premieres, people are showing up and doing it multiple times, in some cases handing out hundreds of DVDs or hundreds and hundreds of flyers with websites.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.541]  And people are going home.
[00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.522]  They're watching that.
[00:50:18.542 --> 00:50:19.623]  They're going to make copies.
[00:50:19.723 --> 00:50:21.784]  It's going to have an exponential effect.
[00:50:22.365 --> 00:50:29.511]  Let's say you hand out 100 DVDs, and 10 people you give those copies to make on average 5 copies.
[00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:32.773]  Then that force multiplies the information.
[00:50:32.833 --> 00:50:36.016]  It just grows and grows and grows and grows.
[00:50:36.636 --> 00:50:41.060]  One DVD can turn into millions of DVDs.
[00:50:41.903 --> 00:50:43.444]  So viciously make copies.
[00:50:43.484 --> 00:50:53.649]  Just viciously sit there and make copies and give them to people and email around links where you can download these videos like martial law that we put out for free.
[00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:58.912]  Right now, that Google video, it is so powerful.
[00:50:58.972 --> 00:50:59.692]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.813 --> 00:51:06.135]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.335 --> 00:51:10.798]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.898 --> 00:51:11.418]  There is a
[00:51:13.319 --> 00:51:15.300]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.121]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.461 --> 00:51:22.682]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.742 --> 00:51:29.664]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.804 --> 00:51:31.805]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.065 --> 00:51:42.509]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:48.171]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:54.048 --> 00:52:54.829]  We're good to go.
[00:53:18.186 --> 00:53:18.846]  We're good to go.
[00:53:47.722 --> 00:53:50.806]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.966 --> 00:53:56.833]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:12.609 --> 00:54:23.374]  If you read the letter, the 18-page letter that the president of Iran sent George Bush, it's unprecedented, never been done by an Iranian leader since the coup.
[00:54:25.075 --> 00:54:27.616]  Iranian president's letter highlights 9-1-1 inside job.
[00:54:29.881 --> 00:54:34.724]  It says, Iranian President answers warning to the world challenge that we issued last year.
[00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:44.369]  Iranian President, it's a letter to George W. Bush, hit the headlines for many reasons, but the most important segment in which he discusses government-sponsored terror has largely been ignored.
[00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:46.230]  Here's an excerpt from the letter.
[00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.911]  September 11th was not a simple operation.
[00:54:48.991 --> 00:54:57.536]  Could it be planned and executed without coordination with intelligence and security services or their extensive infiltration?
[00:54:58.659 --> 00:55:01.281]  Of course, this is just an educated guess.
[00:55:02.102 --> 00:55:05.224]  Why have the various aspects of the attacks been kept secret?
[00:55:05.704 --> 00:55:08.606]  Why are we not told who botched their responsibilities?
[00:55:09.126 --> 00:55:13.269]  And why aren't those responsible and the guilty parties identified and put on trial?
[00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:17.812]  All governments have a duty to provide security and peace of mind for their citizens.
[00:55:18.233 --> 00:55:19.133]  He then went into...
[00:55:20.624 --> 00:55:28.549]  If the terrorists want to scare people, why is your government doing everything it can to use the terror to scare your people and make them feel insecure?
[00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:31.010]  That's something Paul didn't add, but I've noticed that.
[00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.231]  That's a point I've always made.
[00:55:32.691 --> 00:55:36.794]  Back in the 60s and 70s, there were terrorist attacks by real communists in this country.
[00:55:37.274 --> 00:55:41.097]  But because they were real attacks, the media hardly reported on it.
[00:55:42.998 --> 00:55:45.439]  I mean, police were killed, blinded, wounded.
[00:55:45.459 --> 00:55:47.761]  It was mainly police stations that were targeted and over 100 bombings.
[00:55:49.401 --> 00:55:51.724]  By the weathermen and others, and they just didn't hype it.
[00:55:51.745 --> 00:55:56.311]  They said, oh, it's no big deal, because that was real terror, and at that time, the government didn't want to scare people.
[00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:03.052]  But boy, when the government carried out the attacks, it was scaremongering, and they tell you, we're your savior, we'll keep you safe.
[00:56:03.633 --> 00:56:19.459]  In July of 2005, this website issued a challenge to leaders of all rogue states as they're known, imploring them to blow the whistle on the Achilles heel of all major western governments, their propensity to fulfill geopolitical agendas by means of carrying out staged false flag terrorism.
[00:56:20.598 --> 00:56:33.644]  And we went forward and said it is now time for all governments who still operate outside the control of the globalists to come forward and join humanity in unveiling the real terrorists who are attempting to deform the world into a prison planet.
[00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:38.446]  And then Wayne Madison has another report out about this today.
[00:56:38.466 --> 00:56:40.086]  Of course, former NSA officer.
[00:56:40.626 --> 00:56:44.248]  World leaders suspect the Bush administration of involvement in the 9-11 attacks.
[00:56:45.054 --> 00:56:53.360]  The first skeptics to question what role the Bush administration played in the 9-11 terror attacks were a few cabinet ministers in the governments of America's NATO allies.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:57:00.725]  They included German Science and Technology Minister and former Defense Minister Andres von Muehle and British Environment Minister Michael Meacher.
[00:57:00.765 --> 00:57:04.288]  They were joined by Belgian European Parliament member Paul Leone.
[00:57:05.043 --> 00:57:18.915]  However, in recent months, the former cabinet ministers have been joined in their skepticism about the official story of 9-11 by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, as well as the head of the parliament, and Iran's President Mohammed Abarjayad.
[00:57:18.975 --> 00:57:20.136]  I can't ever pronounce his name.
[00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:21.717]  Ahmed Abarjayad.
[00:57:22.731 --> 00:57:24.872]  I can usually pronounce it today.
[00:57:24.892 --> 00:57:26.793]  I'm having a mental block with that.
[00:57:27.914 --> 00:57:33.236]  In March, Chavez said Venezuela will open an official investigation into 9-11 attacks.
[00:57:33.597 --> 00:57:42.581]  Now Chavez has been joined by the president of Iran, who in a recent letter to President George W. Bush asked, why have the various aspects of the 9-11 attacks been kept secret?
[00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:46.963]  The president indicated that the attacks could not have been carried out without the knowledge of the U.S.
[00:57:46.983 --> 00:57:48.264]  security services.
[00:57:49.457 --> 00:57:53.499]  We'll get more into this in the next hour with our guest from Tokyo, Japan.
[00:57:53.559 --> 00:57:59.443]  Before I end this hour, help us get Marshall Law and Road to Tyranny, my two big 9-11 films, out to people.
[00:58:00.483 --> 00:58:02.384]  Many of you have gotten them, have made copies.
[00:58:02.424 --> 00:58:04.346]  If you have originals, please make copies.
[00:58:04.746 --> 00:58:11.990]  If you haven't gotten Marshall Law or Road to Tyranny, please order them today and make DVD copies of them.
[00:58:12.848 --> 00:58:14.468]  And get them out to your friends and family.
[00:58:14.969 --> 00:58:17.189]  Or if you want to support us, buy a bunch of originals.
[00:58:17.229 --> 00:58:22.570]  People are more apt to watch them when they have original color covers and stamps on top of DVDs.
[00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:25.071]  And they're apt to play better if they're not copies.
[00:58:25.471 --> 00:58:26.751]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:28.852]  We've got big discounts when you order them in bulk.

[00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:47.291]  Big Brother.
[00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:48.351]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:50.713]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.295 --> 00:58:54.996]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.196 --> 00:58:56.937]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.011 --> 00:59:09.974]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.194 --> 00:59:14.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:28.027 --> 00:59:30.008]  John F. Marcuso joins us.
[00:59:30.049 --> 00:59:33.431]  He's from New York, but he lives in Japan and teaches there.
[00:59:33.491 --> 00:59:34.652]  He's associate professor.
[00:59:35.606 --> 00:59:47.405]  And a few weeks ago, I saw online screenshots, PDFs I guess, of just an amazing in-depth article that was carried by the Tokyo Journal
[00:59:48.146 --> 00:59:55.969]  I believe issue 255, and we're getting the professor all of his right information up right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:59:56.009 --> 01:00:05.173]  He wrote this with a Japanese colleague, and I want to talk today about 9-11, about how Japanese view it, and also the culture of Japan.
[01:00:05.213 --> 01:00:09.555]  Talk about an imperial culture where they've been conditioned just to go along with the official line.
[01:00:10.055 --> 01:00:10.435]  It is a pleasure.
[01:00:39.016 --> 01:00:40.957]  What time is it in Tokyo right now for you?
[01:00:41.617 --> 01:00:44.139]  It's 2 o'clock in the morning over here.
[01:00:45.159 --> 01:00:46.600]  Boy, you're going to be tired tomorrow.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.921]  I'm exhausted right now.
[01:00:48.941 --> 01:00:50.722]  I've been drinking green tea for the past hour.
[01:00:50.742 --> 01:00:51.482]  I'm pretty wired.
[01:00:52.162 --> 01:00:55.024]  Well, we're really honored to have you on the air with us.
[01:00:55.044 --> 01:00:59.646]  Tell us about the university you're from, the website for the newspaper, so we can read about it.
[01:00:59.706 --> 01:01:00.967]  And then let's launch you to 9-11, sir.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:06.873]  I work at a university called Hitotsubashi University.
[01:01:06.893 --> 01:01:09.575]  It's one of the leading universities in the country.
[01:01:10.496 --> 01:01:13.258]  Very bright students, very eager students.
[01:01:14.259 --> 01:01:23.186]  Basically, it's a social science university, but there are four faculties, Commerce, Economics, Law, and Social Science.
[01:01:24.787 --> 01:01:27.169]  And I am a language teacher.
[01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:30.412]  English primarily, but also Spanish.
[01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:33.981]  Now, at the same time, you write for this magazine.
[01:01:34.021 --> 01:01:36.143]  Tell us about the Tokyo Journal, the city magazine.
[01:01:36.703 --> 01:01:41.427]  I don't write for the Tokyo Journal.
[01:01:41.487 --> 01:01:44.930]  I should say right from the start that... They use you for research.
[01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:46.371]  They use you for the piece, they do.
[01:01:46.611 --> 01:01:47.371]  That's right.
[01:01:48.012 --> 01:01:55.938]  I am very proud of Tokyo Journal and the owner, Dr. Stephen Hauser, for being so courageous to run this article.
[01:01:57.627 --> 01:02:14.694]  My summer project was to speak to any and all publications, print, as well as broadcast people to try to get them to start really seriously investigating September 11th.
[01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:23.699]  And I had people hang up on me and threaten me and, you know, they just, no one would speak to me.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:38.595]  And finally, the Tokyo Journal, a leading English periodical in Japan, said, well, show us, you know, we don't know anything about this, so prove it to us.
[01:02:39.777 --> 01:02:48.623]  I met with them and showed them a number of your mind-blowing documentaries as well as some other documentaries and books.
[01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:51.585]  And they just ran with it.
[01:02:53.286 --> 01:02:58.010]  Well, this is exciting because it really is a blue-chip publication in Japan.
[01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:01.032]  It's an important publication, yes.
[01:03:01.332 --> 01:03:02.893]  A lot of people read this.
[01:03:02.933 --> 01:03:05.835]  Now, were those Japanese publications that would yell at you and hang up on you?
[01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.471]  Oh, well, no.
[01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:11.334]  Japanese as well as English-based publications, sure.
[01:03:13.555 --> 01:03:14.816]  So they didn't want to discuss it?
[01:03:15.557 --> 01:03:16.478]  No, no, not at all.
[01:03:16.738 --> 01:03:16.938]  No.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:27.126]  Well, I want to get into the article and some of the things that people who wrote the article experienced while you helped them put it together with one of your colleagues on the other side, sir.
[01:03:27.546 --> 01:03:29.048]  So please stay with us.
[01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:31.970]  We're talking to Professor...
[01:03:32.936 --> 01:03:34.077]  John F. Marcuso.
[01:03:34.718 --> 01:03:37.181]  And he actually had family in New York when it happened.
[01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:39.563]  We'll also get into that and get into Japanese culture as well.
[01:03:39.844 --> 01:03:41.365]  It's always interesting to explore cultures.
[01:03:41.685 --> 01:03:42.546]  I've never been to Japan.
[01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:43.467]  My wife's been to Japan.
[01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:46.671]  We've interviewed many guests from Japan and folks that have lived in Japan as well.
[01:03:46.731 --> 01:03:52.237]  So it's always good to look into other cultures as well and how they view things and how they've responded to this piece.
[01:03:55.026 --> 01:03:57.868]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.128 --> 01:03:58.829]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.929 --> 01:03:59.709]  Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:04.712]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.053 --> 01:04:11.797]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.117 --> 01:04:14.097]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.298 --> 01:04:17.138]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.258 --> 01:04:21.899]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:26.500]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:33.982]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.222 --> 01:04:36.643]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.803 --> 01:04:38.543]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:04:40.145 --> 01:04:44.691]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:51.701]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:55.407 --> 01:04:59.908]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:05:00.268 --> 01:05:04.349]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:04.649 --> 01:05:05.189]  We listened.
[01:05:05.489 --> 01:05:10.471]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:11.231]  We listened.
[01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:14.672]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:15.092 --> 01:05:15.632]  We listened.
[01:05:16.092 --> 01:05:19.653]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:20.554]  We're good to go.
[01:05:46.206 --> 01:05:49.768]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:06:05.862 --> 01:06:06.342]  We're good to go.
[01:06:32.637 --> 01:06:33.738]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:33.758 --> 01:06:35.078]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:35.098 --> 01:06:35.318]  Professor...
[01:07:03.482 --> 01:07:17.172]  John F. Marcuso joins us from Tokyo, Japan, and he helped do the research with one of his colleagues for a huge cover story that was in one of the largest English language journals in the country.
[01:07:17.192 --> 01:07:20.034]  That's the Tokyo Journal of the City magazine.
[01:07:20.054 --> 01:07:26.278]  I thought it was very fair, and they sourced some of my 9-11 films and some other films as well.
[01:07:26.318 --> 01:07:32.282]  Again, this is just a very fair publication that is read all over Japan.
[01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:46.454]  And so I wanted to talk about yourself and your colleagues and some of the things you experienced doing the research and assisting this publication in doing this report and how the Japanese have responded to this professor.
[01:07:46.814 --> 01:07:50.876]  So please tell us the whole story about how you got into this and then what happened.
[01:07:52.496 --> 01:07:53.256]  September 11th?
[01:07:54.177 --> 01:07:55.077]  Yes, September 11th.
[01:07:55.737 --> 01:08:00.719]  Well, I'm a native New Yorker, born and raised from Brooklyn, New York.
[01:08:02.431 --> 01:08:07.435]  I saw the trim towers go up when I was in elementary school, fascinated by them.
[01:08:08.295 --> 01:08:12.078]  Not exactly loved, as you have pointed out a number of times.
[01:08:12.699 --> 01:08:15.781]  Towers took a long time for New Yorkers to really fall in love with.
[01:08:17.703 --> 01:08:28.031]  On the night for us, but of course the morning in New York of September 11th, a friend of mine gave me a call and asked me to turn on the TV, and there were the
[01:08:28.908 --> 01:08:41.311]  There was a North Tower burning, and it was a very surreal picture, because there was no sound, just the long shot of the tower burning.
[01:08:41.991 --> 01:08:48.833]  And when I was on the phone, I said, well, hey, you know, there are fires in those towers all the time.
[01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:58.375]  My brother, his, at the time, girlfriend, now wife, so his mother-in-law,
[01:08:59.033 --> 01:09:04.004]  worked as a security person, so she knew quite a lot about the goings-on.
[01:09:04.871 --> 01:09:05.511]  At the towers.
[01:09:05.651 --> 01:09:10.772]  And one day, this is quite a number of years ago, we were getting some tickets.
[01:09:10.792 --> 01:09:23.515]  There was a ticket center, and I was with his then-girlfriend, and she was talking about all the different goings-on and the bomb scares every single day and the fires in the building.
[01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:30.757]  So when I'm looking at this long shot that was being broadcast live on Japanese TV, I didn't think anything of it.
[01:09:31.717 --> 01:09:32.957]  It's a large fire.
[01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:51.915]  But just a minute after picking up the phone and turning on the TV, there came out of the right side of the screen that silhouette of the airliner crashing into the other tower with a fireball erupting in the background.
[01:09:52.395 --> 01:10:00.637]  And, you know, when dealing with Japanese, you know, you shouldn't expect, you know...
[01:10:02.133 --> 01:10:02.854]  Quick answers.
[01:10:02.874 --> 01:10:04.214]  I was like, well, what was that?
[01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:05.255]  I don't know.
[01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:06.496]  Was that a plane?
[01:10:07.056 --> 01:10:07.596]  I don't know.
[01:10:07.696 --> 01:10:08.397]  What do you think?
[01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:10.818]  Something was going on.
[01:10:10.838 --> 01:10:12.899]  I said, look, thank you very much for informing me about this.
[01:10:12.999 --> 01:10:14.020]  I have to get off right away.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.843]  I hung up, called up my father, got through.
[01:10:19.863 --> 01:10:22.185]  He picked up.
[01:10:22.205 --> 01:10:25.607]  He said, you know, the TV just went out.
[01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:26.947]  Don't know what's going on.
[01:10:26.967 --> 01:10:28.108]  I heard a couple of explosions.
[01:10:28.168 --> 01:10:29.829]  And I said, look, I am looking at a
[01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.251]  We're good to go.
[01:10:52.478 --> 01:10:55.379]  Tell Paul, get him on the phone, tell him to get out of there as quickly as possible.
[01:10:55.939 --> 01:10:59.280]  I was very concerned about my brother because he's learning disabled.
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.141]  He is mentally retarded.
[01:11:01.301 --> 01:11:02.721]  Borderline intelligence.
[01:11:02.981 --> 01:11:03.741]  He does have a job.
[01:11:04.662 --> 01:11:06.222]  Very pleasant man.
[01:11:06.242 --> 01:11:08.383]  You can have conversations with him.
[01:11:09.063 --> 01:11:17.005]  But a person in his condition, if the schedule is disrupted in any way, he panics.
[01:11:20.226 --> 01:11:23.488]  And my father, unfortunately, wasn't able to get him on the phone.
[01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:30.253]  And, of course, with what was going on over there, I mean, you know, there was bedlam.
[01:11:31.273 --> 01:11:38.158]  And after the towers, they were told in their building to stay put, which was, of course, a mistake.
[01:11:39.779 --> 01:11:42.160]  And when the towers fell, electricity went out.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:46.223]  My brother, I was told later, was in one of these sub-sub-basements.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:12:00.608]  And he knew the labyrinth of tunnels and this maze of tunnels that were under all of these different buildings connecting together and going into shopping malls and subway stations, etc.
[01:12:01.008 --> 01:12:09.613]  He basically groped his way through these tunnels, people falling over him, him getting banged up.
[01:12:10.208 --> 01:12:12.870]  When did you start questioning the official fable?
[01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:13.631]  Immediately.
[01:12:39.582 --> 01:12:40.183]  Immediately.
[01:12:40.203 --> 01:12:41.664]  Tell us about that.
[01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.591]  I saw these buildings go up.
[01:12:49.851 --> 01:12:53.014]  Of course, I was a child at the time, but I mean, I was fascinated.
[01:12:53.434 --> 01:12:56.356]  Being a child, you're interested in construction.
[01:12:56.457 --> 01:12:57.638]  I saw them going up.
[01:12:57.718 --> 01:12:59.039]  They were massive.
[01:13:01.233 --> 01:13:10.236]  I was a student in Spain and I had lots of Spanish friends coming over and I went up in them 20 times or so.
[01:13:10.256 --> 01:13:17.278]  And, you know, these were just absolutely humongous structures.
[01:13:17.718 --> 01:13:21.459]  And to see them fall so quickly, it made no sense to me.
[01:13:21.599 --> 01:13:22.459]  And, of course, it did.
[01:13:23.039 --> 01:13:24.560]  It looked like an implosion.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.901]  But what really got me was how quickly, after...
[01:13:30.914 --> 01:13:34.677]  After the initial so-called attack, how quickly the U.S.
[01:13:34.717 --> 01:13:39.741]  government came out with not just pictures, but profiles of these so-called hijackers.
[01:13:40.361 --> 01:13:40.962]  And I thought, wow!
[01:13:41.002 --> 01:13:49.308]  Before the second tower was hit, CIA director, then director Tenet, was on television saying it was bin Laden.
[01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:53.492]  Remarkable.
[01:13:53.912 --> 01:13:54.272]  Wow.
[01:13:54.673 --> 01:13:55.413]  Great intelligence.
[01:13:57.215 --> 01:13:59.797]  Why didn't they, you know... For me...
[01:14:00.509 --> 01:14:02.470]  For me, it just seemed logical.
[01:14:02.490 --> 01:14:07.213]  Well, if they have pictures and profiles of these people, why aren't they trailing them?
[01:14:07.514 --> 01:14:09.135]  How do they get on board?
[01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:22.923]  And then it turns out with Able Danger and the rest of it, the government did, quote, try to stop the decoys, and that's what they were, were patsies and were ordered in Defense Intelligence, FBI, CIA to back off the case or they'd be arrested, and that's now all part of the record.
[01:14:22.984 --> 01:14:28.287]  So it took years, though, I guess, for this to percolate until you started to go public, or give us that timeline.
[01:14:29.538 --> 01:14:31.180]  Oh, no, no, right away, right away.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.863]  It just didn't smell right.
[01:14:35.183 --> 01:14:47.594]  And I have to thank you, Mr. Jones, because it was getting on the Internet, and your site was one of the first that I had seen.
[01:14:47.614 --> 01:14:53.359]  And I have to admit, in all honesty, at first it was too overwhelming.
[01:14:54.398 --> 01:14:55.819]  And I had to back off.
[01:14:55.899 --> 01:15:00.181]  And I took about a month or two, and I went back.
[01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:13.528]  Because being confronted with this information, it breaks down our whole understanding of government and society and who we are as a people.
[01:15:13.688 --> 01:15:15.709]  It's world-shaking.
[01:15:15.769 --> 01:15:16.950]  It's world-shifting.
[01:15:17.603 --> 01:15:17.863]  It is.
[01:15:18.283 --> 01:15:18.524]  It is.
[01:15:18.584 --> 01:15:20.665]  So I had to step back.
[01:15:20.945 --> 01:15:26.908]  I remember, day one, we had posted Operation Northwoods, the official government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[01:15:27.328 --> 01:15:28.748]  We had the insider trading.
[01:15:29.409 --> 01:15:31.670]  We had the fact that NORAD stood down.
[01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:36.732]  We knew this within the first day, and we had that up on Infowars.com.
[01:15:36.752 --> 01:15:38.013]  What did you think when you were seeing this?
[01:15:39.554 --> 01:15:42.315]  It was overwhelming, and I thought... It was mind-blowing, and...
[01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:51.271]  And it put me in a state of complete confusion.
[01:15:51.291 --> 01:15:54.873]  That's why I had to back off and give myself some distance.
[01:15:55.473 --> 01:15:59.614]  But when I was talking to other people about this, I said, you know, take a look at this site.
[01:15:59.674 --> 01:16:01.435]  Take a look at Infowars.com.
[01:16:03.035 --> 01:16:06.536]  And people, you know, also had the same reaction.
[01:16:06.876 --> 01:16:09.257]  No, you're confused.
[01:16:09.977 --> 01:16:11.278]  You know, take a Valium.
[01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:12.658]  Take a vacation.
[01:16:12.738 --> 01:16:14.639]  No, no, no, it's not true.
[01:16:14.699 --> 01:16:15.559]  It's impossible.
[01:16:18.676 --> 01:16:19.856]  Because, as you said, it is.
[01:16:19.936 --> 01:16:22.357]  It's earth-shaking, all of this information.
[01:16:23.277 --> 01:16:26.718]  So, just within a month or so, you started to talk to friends.
[01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:32.059]  What brought you to then getting together with the media and calling the media?
[01:16:32.079 --> 01:16:34.980]  I mean, you did what good people should do.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.640]  You contacted the press, you told us earlier, started asking to do reports.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.221]  How long after 9-11 did you start that?
[01:16:43.521 --> 01:16:44.282]  Pretty quickly.
[01:16:44.882 --> 01:16:45.722]  Pretty quickly, but...
[01:16:48.326 --> 01:16:51.367]  People, it was too fresh.
[01:16:51.467 --> 01:16:52.607]  It was too new.
[01:16:52.727 --> 01:17:03.231]  So it took four years for you to finally, how long ago did you finally contact the Tokyo Journal and then how long was the education process where you showed them all these documentaries and documents and news articles?
[01:17:03.811 --> 01:17:05.771]  Well, this was my summer project.
[01:17:05.891 --> 01:17:10.713]  So this past summer I spoke to I don't know how many hundreds of different publications.
[01:17:12.289 --> 01:17:16.912]  And they were the courageous people that took this up.
[01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.274]  No, for them, it was immediate.
[01:17:21.315 --> 01:17:32.363]  Show them Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror, some of your classic titles.
[01:17:32.383 --> 01:17:35.365]  And they just said, I need more.
[01:17:35.425 --> 01:17:36.686]  I want to see more, you know.
[01:17:37.469 --> 01:17:43.733]  And, of course, getting on to the Infowars.com and Prison Planet, etc.
[01:17:43.753 --> 01:17:44.854]  So they read all of that.
[01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:50.897]  Well, this is exciting to see fair media that looks at the facts and reports on it.
[01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:54.719]  I want to talk about the response you and others have gotten to the piece.
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:18:00.303]  What response to the Tokyo Journal, one of the big publications in the country, what response have they gotten to the piece?
[01:18:01.003 --> 01:18:03.665]  Well, as soon as it was published, I was told...
[01:18:05.129 --> 01:18:16.516]  That quite a number of foreign press were given, or in fact, actually had it already in their hands, printed out, photocopies of them.
[01:18:17.476 --> 01:18:27.882]  This was given out at another media event that had nothing related to the Tokyo Journal article.
[01:18:28.402 --> 01:18:33.765]  So this was told me by a colleague that happened to be there and said, wow, all these people had these
[01:18:34.326 --> 01:18:40.969]  Independent news organizations had this article in hand, and they were talking about it.
[01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:43.130]  Well, yeah, they talk about courage.
[01:18:43.271 --> 01:18:48.593]  They talk about who, I mean, because we've had nothing but unfair national hit pieces here in the U.S.
[01:18:49.073 --> 01:18:51.655]  and predominantly in Europe, so this is big.
[01:18:51.675 --> 01:18:52.095]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.358 --> 01:18:55.039]  Hello, folks.

[01:20:53.835 --> 01:21:02.467]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[01:21:03.288 --> 01:21:08.214]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[01:21:08.955 --> 01:21:14.959]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[01:21:15.659 --> 01:21:24.085]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their one world government.
[01:21:24.565 --> 01:21:25.005]  516-8736 That's 1-800-

[01:22:27.587 --> 01:22:27.787]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:23:00.433 --> 01:23:04.614]  Professor John F. Marcuso is our guest from Tokyo, Japan.
[01:23:04.634 --> 01:23:27.462]  This isn't just a story about 9-11, it's a testament to one man taking action, making phone calls, getting the press to cover something serious, and now this fair report out of the Tokyo Journal has gone worldwide and millions and millions of people have read it on the internet alone.
[01:23:28.987 --> 01:23:32.711]  Continuing, Professor, I want to talk about the response you guys got to this piece.
[01:23:32.731 --> 01:23:38.175]  Then let's get into what the piece actually covers and what you think the biggest smoking guns of 9-11 are.
[01:23:38.195 --> 01:23:39.256]  Then we'll take some calls.
[01:23:39.716 --> 01:23:40.857]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:41.077 --> 01:23:48.543]  But first let me ask, was anybody involved in this piece intimidated?
[01:23:48.563 --> 01:23:50.645]  Did anybody get calls from the government?
[01:23:50.665 --> 01:23:51.646]  Did anything like that happen?
[01:23:52.774 --> 01:23:53.514]  Not that I know of.
[01:23:54.394 --> 01:23:59.876]  I tried to get the owner of Tokyo Journal, Stephen Hauser, on the phone.
[01:24:00.976 --> 01:24:08.838]  Unfortunately, he travels quite a bit inside of the country, so I don't have any information about that.
[01:24:09.799 --> 01:24:10.939]  But as far as I know, no.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:16.340]  Tell us more about the response you've witnessed to the piece.
[01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:18.421]  Everyone that's seen it...
[01:24:20.037 --> 01:24:25.040]  You know, just throws up their hands and says, knew it all the time, knew it all along.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:35.785]  And, of course, they're amazed that a publication like the Tokyo Journal would run a story like this.
[01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:47.851]  I mean, this magazine is subscribed to by all the major...
[01:24:48.599 --> 01:24:50.240]  And that's the same response I've gotten, knew it all along.
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.641]  Why do you think the establishment thought they could get away with something this big and this obvious?
[01:24:53.661 --> 01:24:58.463]  Because power corrupts absolutely.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:27.008]  And these people, their egos are so huge that they think that us, the so-called downtrodden, can't figure it out.
[01:25:27.568 --> 01:25:33.412]  Or that we would be frightened and timid and just stay in our holes.
[01:25:34.213 --> 01:25:37.135]  And they're learning that no, that is not true.
[01:25:37.235 --> 01:25:38.276]  We will not.
[01:25:41.562 --> 01:25:42.523]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:25:42.983 --> 01:25:47.125]  And if the elite thinks they can get away with this, I mean, it just shows how delusional they are.
[01:25:47.145 --> 01:25:51.348]  And it also tells the people we're dealing with hardcore cold-blooded killers.
[01:25:52.068 --> 01:25:52.488]  It's true.
[01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:53.849]  It is absolutely true, yes.
[01:25:54.469 --> 01:25:55.750]  And they will stop at nothing.
[01:25:55.950 --> 01:26:06.496]  And that's why we do, we must get out onto the streets and talk to people and hand out information so people can go and become informed.
[01:26:07.398 --> 01:26:18.423]  Talking to the average Japanese citizen there in Tokyo about 9-11, what's their take on it, pre-Tokyo Journal article, now post-Tokyo Journal article?
[01:26:19.943 --> 01:26:20.944]  That's a great question.
[01:26:20.964 --> 01:26:32.849]  You know, the Japanese, Japan is a very complex culture, and it's a hierarchical culture.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.302]  The Japanese are very well-educated people.
[01:26:39.262 --> 01:26:41.204]  They are very well-read people.
[01:26:42.304 --> 01:26:50.210]  Average Japanese businessman will read five or six different publications a day, you know, a couple of novels a month.
[01:26:50.970 --> 01:27:00.837]  Sure, they read their manga, you know, just to relax, but, you know, they read the hardcore stuff as well, hard news, and, of course, a lot of alternative news.
[01:27:00.857 --> 01:27:01.878]  Yeah.
[01:27:03.277 --> 01:27:14.724]  But when speaking to them, they're non-confrontational, regardless of some of the myths and some of the misconceptions about the Japanese.
[01:27:14.744 --> 01:27:19.006]  And they really want to be left alone.
[01:27:19.086 --> 01:27:20.107]  Don't bother us.
[01:27:21.387 --> 01:27:22.128]  We don't want to know.
[01:27:22.148 --> 01:27:23.308]  We don't want to know the truth.
[01:27:24.249 --> 01:27:32.033]  And this is difficult, because when you confront them with something so huge, it really does rock their world.
[01:27:32.674 --> 01:27:32.794]  And...
[01:27:34.524 --> 01:27:37.406]  On the one hand, yes, okay, we knew it all along.
[01:27:37.466 --> 01:27:38.327]  And they'll tell me that.
[01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:40.208]  Yes, of course, of course.
[01:27:40.909 --> 01:27:45.472]  We knew that it was just too well planned.
[01:27:46.333 --> 01:27:48.054]  It went off without a hitch.
[01:27:49.135 --> 01:27:49.996]  It's impossible.
[01:27:50.036 --> 01:27:50.996]  It could not have happened.
[01:27:51.096 --> 01:28:00.763]  And, you know, I heard this day one, just, you know, talking to people, going into a coffee shop or whatever, and just like, oh, you're hard.
[01:28:00.803 --> 01:28:01.344]  Where are you from?
[01:28:01.915 --> 01:28:02.496]  I'm from New York.
[01:28:02.536 --> 01:28:03.576]  Oh, my God, you're from New York.
[01:28:03.997 --> 01:28:04.757]  Oh, oh, oh.
[01:28:05.157 --> 01:28:06.098]  What do you think about that?
[01:28:07.119 --> 01:28:10.441]  And asking them, what do you think about that?
[01:28:10.561 --> 01:28:14.464]  Oh, well, hmm, very strange, don't you think?
[01:28:15.845 --> 01:28:20.108]  So, yeah, they can figure it out.
[01:28:20.849 --> 01:28:22.650]  Well, I haven't been to Japan.
[01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:25.312]  I've just read the different international studies on the Japanese.
[01:28:25.392 --> 01:28:27.934]  Aren't they the most educated people in the world?
[01:28:29.079 --> 01:28:30.160]  This is what they say, yes.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:33.603]  And being here for 17 years, I would say, yes, they are.
[01:28:33.923 --> 01:28:34.724]  Very well educated.
[01:28:34.744 --> 01:28:36.745]  So day one they knew, because they're not idiots.
[01:28:37.366 --> 01:28:37.586]  No.
[01:28:37.726 --> 01:28:42.070]  And you've got the average American, doesn't know how many continents there are, and can't find Iraq on a map.
[01:28:42.570 --> 01:28:43.271]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.331 --> 01:28:45.252]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.733 --> 01:28:47.334]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.255 --> 01:28:50.937]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.005 --> 01:29:00.329]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:05.373]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.693 --> 01:29:13.358]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.658 --> 01:29:20.503]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.723 --> 01:29:22.104]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:22.264 --> 01:29:22.764]  We're good to go.
[01:29:46.491 --> 01:29:47.452]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.937 --> 01:30:02.204]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.465 --> 01:30:06.808]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:16.037]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.237 --> 01:30:19.860]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:25.166]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.467 --> 01:30:32.155]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.668 --> 01:30:33.329]  What about you?
[01:30:33.969 --> 01:30:39.334]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:39.374 --> 01:30:40.475]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.555 --> 01:30:42.437]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.478 --> 01:30:55.298]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:55.518 --> 01:30:57.340]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:00.702]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:01.603]  What did you do?
[01:31:01.703 --> 01:31:02.523]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:04.605]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:04.885 --> 01:31:10.409]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:10.689 --> 01:31:16.954]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:17.294 --> 01:31:19.496]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:19.796 --> 01:31:22.658]  And get this, they guarantee my success in writing.
[01:31:23.138 --> 01:31:26.581]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:31:26.842 --> 01:31:27.282]  Whoa.
[01:31:27.642 --> 01:31:28.843]  What was that website again?
[01:31:28.923 --> 01:31:32.407]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:32.707 --> 01:31:33.828]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:33.968 --> 01:31:38.272]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:38.412 --> 01:31:38.993]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:39.273 --> 01:31:40.474]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:40.874 --> 01:31:41.535]  Check, please.
[01:31:43.281 --> 01:31:44.762]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:31:45.222 --> 01:31:45.843]  Sure, John.
[01:31:46.063 --> 01:31:50.406]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:50.726 --> 01:31:52.407]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:52.587 --> 01:31:52.927]  Deal.
[01:31:58.871 --> 01:32:00.792]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.272 --> 01:32:04.094]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.335 --> 01:32:12.359]  For anyone that wonders why I spend so much time on 9-11, I do at least one or two segments a week on it, sometimes more.
[01:32:13.354 --> 01:32:20.180]  Why all of my films, except for one in the last four and a half years, have been about 9-11 and government-sponsored terror.
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.221]  Because look at the government.
[01:32:21.742 --> 01:32:22.923]  Every day they use it.
[01:32:22.983 --> 01:32:29.769]  When the police walk up to you in downtown Austin to one of my employees two days ago and say, you can't videotape the governor's mansion.
[01:32:30.029 --> 01:32:30.910]  Well, why can't I?
[01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:31.691]  It's free speech.
[01:32:32.111 --> 01:32:32.632]  I'm media.
[01:32:32.972 --> 01:32:34.093]  Well, it's a post-9-11 world.
[01:32:36.139 --> 01:32:40.982]  Oh, you know, we have to warrantlessly take your bank account for the IRS.
[01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:41.922]  Well, why?
[01:32:41.982 --> 01:32:43.603]  Well, it's a post-9-11 world.
[01:32:44.224 --> 01:32:47.305]  Everything's a post-9-11 world, post-9-11 world.
[01:32:47.725 --> 01:32:53.909]  It is the foundational event for the Iraq invasion, for the Iran attack that's now on the front burner.
[01:32:54.529 --> 01:33:00.253]  Now, it is literally a crystallizing event, a seminal event that we've witnessed.
[01:33:00.273 --> 01:33:01.333]  Now, I know we have loaded phones.
[01:33:01.353 --> 01:33:02.934]  We'll be going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:03.275 --> 01:33:05.696]  We're talking to John F. Marcuso.
[01:33:05.796 --> 01:33:11.620]  He is an American living in Japan for over a decade, and he teaches there at a local university.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:15.943]  And he contacted the media and contacted, he said, over 100 publications.
[01:33:16.363 --> 01:33:19.165]  Finally got the Tokyo Journal to listen to him and one of his colleagues.
[01:33:20.086 --> 01:33:28.993]  The Tokyo Journal, the East City Magazine, is a huge nationwide publication, and it has sent shockwaves not just across Japan, but across the media in the world.
[01:33:29.694 --> 01:33:39.662]  John, do you want to get into more detail about how you talked to associates who said they were at other big media events, and copies of the journal, even before it was out, were being handed out to media?
[01:33:39.682 --> 01:33:45.647]  Well, Global Peace, you have a link on the Infowars site,
[01:33:47.869 --> 01:33:54.735]  is run by a woman by the name of Yumi Kikuchi, and she is just an amazing woman.
[01:33:56.337 --> 01:34:12.570]  Soon after September 11th, some of her friends put together this organization, and she gives countless lectures every year on just what you talk about.
[01:34:14.462 --> 01:34:21.446]  Global elite, manufactured terrorism, the whole idea of order out of chaos, etc.
[01:34:22.846 --> 01:34:34.252]  And she was at a media event where she saw journalists with the photocopied of the article, of the Tokyo Journal article.
[01:34:35.812 --> 01:34:36.933]  That's the only one that I know of.
[01:34:37.113 --> 01:34:38.013]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:34:38.053 --> 01:34:40.094]  I know it's been all over the web here in the U.S.
[01:34:40.134 --> 01:34:42.395]  and a lot of media people I've talked to have seen it.
[01:34:44.125 --> 01:34:45.886]  Where do you see 9-11 going?
[01:34:45.966 --> 01:34:49.569]  Because obviously Bush's approval rating, even in Gallup Poll, is at 30%.
[01:34:50.690 --> 01:34:56.614]  He's lost 16% of his conservative base that he said he couldn't lose in focus groups just in the last two weeks.
[01:34:56.975 --> 01:34:57.975]  He's in a free fall.
[01:34:58.055 --> 01:35:05.161]  Obviously Bush is just a puppet, but the elite use him as a gauge or a yardstick, kind of a thermometer, to see what's happening.
[01:35:06.162 --> 01:35:10.565]  Looking at this, if they carry out another attack, I think it will get exposed as an inside job
[01:35:11.185 --> 01:35:18.530]  Even faster than we've seen with 9-11, but at the same time it looks like they need an attack to get the Iran attack back on the tracks.
[01:35:19.851 --> 01:35:30.777]  What I'm afraid of living in Japan is that the government over here is really kind of pushing through a number of very key legislation.
[01:35:30.797 --> 01:35:38.182]  Just in the past couple of years, there have been dismounting kind of forced nationalism laws
[01:35:39.007 --> 01:35:47.113]  There are flag laws now and national anthem laws where you must stand up and raise the flag at certain ceremonies.
[01:35:47.953 --> 01:35:54.438]  Before that, if you want to hoist the flag, the Hinomaru, you could.
[01:35:54.678 --> 01:35:55.999]  If you don't, well, that's fine.
[01:35:56.419 --> 01:35:57.340]  Now, you must.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:01.422]  Before, if you wanted to sing Kimigayo, the national anthem...
[01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:04.359]  If you want to, that's great.
[01:36:04.519 --> 01:36:07.602]  Let me comment on this because I'm not in Japan, but I've been following it.
[01:36:08.442 --> 01:36:13.646]  The Japanese Parliament announced, what, a year ago, that they're talking about developing nuclear weapons.
[01:36:14.327 --> 01:36:18.030]  The reports are that they've got a secret nuclear weapons program.
[01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:19.231]  We're good to go.
[01:36:35.291 --> 01:36:35.532]  It's true.
[01:36:35.552 --> 01:36:37.754]  There are a couple of really important key pieces of legislation.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:04.872]  Very soon there's going to be something translated as the National Referendum Act.
[01:37:04.892 --> 01:37:12.124]  And if you can believe this, that any change to the Constitution cannot be discussed in the media.
[01:37:14.596 --> 01:37:15.396]  Can you fathom this?
[01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:25.619]  And, of course, one of the big changes is they're talking about going away from a purely defensive military to an offensive military, and they're citing Bush's preemptive war statements.
[01:37:26.179 --> 01:37:26.619]  Exactly.
[01:37:26.659 --> 01:37:33.161]  So Article 9, which states that military is only for defensive measures, right.
[01:37:33.961 --> 01:37:38.202]  Also, there's another piece of legislation that's coming in,
[01:37:38.943 --> 01:37:45.825]  Of being discussed right now, and this is to make the Japanese school children more patriotic.
[01:37:47.606 --> 01:37:57.169]  The mandatory elementary, junior, and senior high school that there will be a type of nationalistic curriculum introduced.
[01:37:58.649 --> 01:38:07.011]  One of the more scary pieces of legislation is something called... I don't really know how to translate it...
[01:38:09.176 --> 01:38:20.638]  A legislation that will not allow, if you can believe this, not allow two people to plan some event.
[01:38:21.678 --> 01:38:30.640]  That is, if you want to get together with your friends and say, hey, let's plan to have a demonstration, you could be arrested.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.281]  Or let's plan to have a party, you could be arrested.
[01:38:35.021 --> 01:38:35.821]  Two or more people.
[01:38:37.637 --> 01:39:04.240]  The idea behind this is, the way that it's being sold, rather, to the people is that, well, hold on a second, this is really purely anti-gangster, anti-mafia, yakuza, anti-crime type of legislation, but the way that it's being written, it can be applied to any normal person wanting to have a peaceful protest.
[01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:06.540]  But that's pretty scary.
[01:39:06.681 --> 01:39:16.005]  Now, MacArthur was in Japan for many years, and our government broke it up and basically still has a lot of control over it to this day.
[01:39:16.045 --> 01:39:20.427]  So don't think, folks, that Japan is moving into militarization by accident.
[01:39:20.967 --> 01:39:23.969]  When you talk to Japanese about this, what's their take on it?
[01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:25.529]  They're very upset.
[01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:30.592]  Well, you know, a lot of Japanese don't know about some of this key legislation.
[01:39:31.192 --> 01:39:33.193]  This is also quite frightening because
[01:39:34.532 --> 01:39:37.052]  There really isn't a free press in this country.
[01:39:39.673 --> 01:39:44.254]  The press here is really controlled by, well, whoever.
[01:39:44.774 --> 01:39:48.614]  And they are told what to write and how to write it and how to sell it to the people.
[01:39:48.834 --> 01:39:50.915]  Well, then let this Tokyo Journal piece get out.
[01:39:51.355 --> 01:39:52.575]  Well, now this is interesting.
[01:39:53.575 --> 01:39:59.536]  There, of course, there are the foreign media and foreign publications.
[01:39:59.676 --> 01:40:00.777]  So that leaks in.
[01:40:01.457 --> 01:40:01.677]  Yes.
[01:40:02.337 --> 01:40:02.477]  But...
[01:40:04.156 --> 01:40:16.979]  Even talking just about the Japanese publication, so you have the quote-unquote legitimate publications, famous Asahi newspaper, Mayonichi, etc.
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:29.943]  And then you have another layer, a lower layer of a tabloid periodical that can run all sorts of different stories.
[01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:42.897]  And it's really in this layer, these so-called tabloid periodicals, which really have some amazingly hard-hitting stories.
[01:40:43.417 --> 01:40:55.444]  And just a couple of months ago, one of them ran a September 11th piece talking about the Pentagon and the Power Hour documentary in plain sight.
[01:40:56.625 --> 01:40:58.626]  So more and more is starting to come out.
[01:40:58.766 --> 01:41:00.127]  I want to take some calls, but
[01:41:02.154 --> 01:41:04.616]  I want to get your view on the U.S.
[01:41:04.656 --> 01:41:14.205]  When you talk to friends and family in New York, what is their view on 9-11 four and a half, almost five years later now versus what it was four and a half, five years ago?
[01:41:14.745 --> 01:41:15.926]  Well, people are waking up.
[01:41:17.047 --> 01:41:24.054]  One of my great joys is that my mother and father now understand that it was a self-inflicted wound.
[01:41:26.258 --> 01:41:29.120]  Soon after, you know, my father was praising Bush.
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:33.322]  He's like, hey, this is... Although, Tokyo Journal got it wrong.
[01:41:33.582 --> 01:41:36.824]  My family, they're lifelong Democrats, not Republicans.
[01:41:36.864 --> 01:41:46.849]  But that's why I mentioned my parents, because here you have a lifelong Democrat, and he's saying, hey, you know, Bush, you know, we need a strong leader, et cetera.
[01:41:46.889 --> 01:41:49.410]  Now, of course, my father wants him impeached.
[01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:51.511]  He wants him, you know, he wants him jailed.
[01:41:52.211 --> 01:41:53.912]  Let there be a real investigation.
[01:41:53.952 --> 01:41:55.053]  My father is fuming.
[01:41:55.792 --> 01:42:02.555]  So is my mother, and now, of course, my brothers and other family members are waking up, and lots of New Yorkers are.
[01:42:02.935 --> 01:42:07.857]  It's the same thing with New Yorkers I know that two years ago were mad at me and now know the truth.
[01:42:08.518 --> 01:42:12.640]  I wonder why suddenly it's really becoming accepted.
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:13.880]  I don't know.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:18.182]  The hundred monkey theory.
[01:42:20.283 --> 01:42:24.625]  People are just finally getting a hold of this information and watching it, the loose change.
[01:42:25.755 --> 01:42:35.597]  Road to Tyranny, all of your amazing work, Martial Law, your documentaries, people are making copies of them and handing them out.
[01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:44.159]  Three years ago, I had my first screening of Martial Law in my apartment.
[01:42:44.359 --> 01:42:47.099]  Hey, a bunch of friends came over, let's just watch it.
[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:49.340]  Gee, can I have a copy of it?
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.520]  Can I make a copy of it?
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:54.181]  Yeah, Mr. Jones says you can burn your own copies as long as you don't sell them.
[01:42:54.321 --> 01:42:55.261]  Wow, amazing.
[01:42:55.834 --> 01:42:56.914]  Start spreading that way.
[01:42:58.575 --> 01:42:59.235]  It's wonderful.
[01:42:59.355 --> 01:43:05.497]  We're going to take a few calls, Professor, but before we do that, any other key points you want to add that I haven't given you a chance to state?
[01:43:06.897 --> 01:43:17.701]  Well, as a matter of fact, Yumi Kikuchi is putting together the first Tokyo International 9-11 Truth Conference.
[01:43:19.061 --> 01:43:22.162]  It's tentatively slated for October 7th.
[01:43:23.731 --> 01:43:28.372]  Mr. Walters, Jimmy Walters, is coming, and so is William Rodriguez.
[01:43:29.032 --> 01:43:31.353]  I would love you to come, if you can make it.
[01:43:31.893 --> 01:43:34.613]  I'd love to, but I'm always tied down here on the home front.
[01:43:35.673 --> 01:43:38.874]  Here in my command bunker, here in the nest.
[01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:48.856]  But I am going to a conference in early June, and I'm having my own June 24th and 25th in Los Angeles, California.
[01:43:49.543 --> 01:43:50.404]  I wish I could be there.
[01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:51.725]  No, I'd love to see you there.
[01:43:51.765 --> 01:43:53.486]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:43:53.546 --> 01:43:55.327]  I'm sure these will be all over the map, but that's okay.
[01:43:55.868 --> 01:43:57.369]  Jim in Indiana, you're on the air.
[01:43:57.409 --> 01:43:57.829]  Go ahead.
[01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:02.413]  Alex, I had a question for a previous guest you had.
[01:44:02.473 --> 01:44:03.133]  Is that okay?
[01:44:03.173 --> 01:44:03.673]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:44:03.834 --> 01:44:04.054]  Sure.
[01:44:04.234 --> 01:44:05.635]  Okay, it was a couple weeks ago.
[01:44:05.675 --> 01:44:06.976]  You had McCoy on there.
[01:44:07.928 --> 01:44:11.333]  Yes, I had a professor out of Wisconsin about torture and government drug dealing.
[01:44:11.753 --> 01:44:15.759]  Okay, the question I have, that night I had a problem with the radio fading in and out.
[01:44:15.819 --> 01:44:16.280]  That's fine.
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:17.221]  What's your question?
[01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:22.388]  Okay, on percentage, he said something about the troops in Vietnam and the percentage.
[01:44:23.542 --> 01:44:30.945]  I don't remember the exact percentage, but our government sold high-quality heroin directly to the tribes to then have a market back in the U.S.
[01:44:31.325 --> 01:44:34.047]  Okay, I think he said something like 34%.
[01:44:34.427 --> 01:44:35.827]  I don't remember, sir.
[01:44:36.088 --> 01:44:39.089]  And it sounded like he said something about fire bases.
[01:44:39.289 --> 01:44:40.990]  Does that bring a bell to you or something?
[01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:43.251]  The interview is posted on Infowars.com.
[01:44:43.271 --> 01:44:43.751]  I don't remember.
[01:44:44.191 --> 01:44:46.193]  Okay, it is on the Infowars, then?
[01:44:46.333 --> 01:44:46.573]  Yes.
[01:44:47.013 --> 01:44:47.313]  Okay.
[01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:48.354]  Alrighty, thank you very much.
[01:44:48.594 --> 01:44:49.215]  Thank you, Jim.
[01:44:49.235 --> 01:44:50.096]  Appreciate the call.
[01:44:50.596 --> 01:44:53.018]  That's another example of problem-reaction solution.
[01:44:53.058 --> 01:45:06.648]  They ship in the narcotics and then fill the prisons up with your children when they use the product the government brings in to begin with, and the very same drug dealers predominantly have done a study of this, then own the private prisons and make the money off that.
[01:45:06.728 --> 01:45:07.528]  It's totally sick.
[01:45:08.509 --> 01:45:10.831]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Maryland.
[01:45:10.871 --> 01:45:11.752]  James, you're on the air.
[01:45:11.792 --> 01:45:12.152]  Go ahead.
[01:45:13.044 --> 01:45:13.705]  Just hung up.
[01:45:14.006 --> 01:45:15.047]  Elias in Michigan.
[01:45:15.067 --> 01:45:15.668]  You're on the air.
[01:45:15.728 --> 01:45:16.169]  Go ahead.
[01:45:16.349 --> 01:45:16.570]  Hi.
[01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.231]  Hi.
[01:45:17.731 --> 01:45:17.952]  Right.
[01:45:18.052 --> 01:45:20.215]  This is concerning phone calls.
[01:45:20.796 --> 01:45:24.602]  This phone call is being recorded now by the telephone company.
[01:45:25.383 --> 01:45:25.824]  That's right.
[01:45:25.844 --> 01:45:27.326]  The whole thing about this is...
[01:45:28.278 --> 01:45:37.580]  All the calls that have been made on all the phones in the United States, and maybe more, is being recorded by the telephone companies, and the government is paying them to do this.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:43.201]  So that every call you have made in the last four or five years on your phone has been recorded.
[01:45:44.701 --> 01:45:46.681]  Sir, you sound like you just... Put him on hold.
[01:45:47.342 --> 01:45:49.882]  You sound like you just learned this and you're very upset.
[01:45:49.902 --> 01:45:53.423]  I don't know how long you've been listening to the show, but in 1996 it was made public.
[01:45:56.010 --> 01:46:08.417]  That the NSA put offices in every major phone switching company and everything is run through and everything is recorded with keywords and that is admitted and that is public and now everyone's freaking out.
[01:46:08.457 --> 01:46:13.600]  I'm getting hundreds of emails literally because it was in the front page of the USA Today today.
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:15.161]  Go ahead and finish up your point, sir.
[01:46:15.805 --> 01:46:17.607]  Well, it is not key words.
[01:46:18.028 --> 01:46:21.552]  They are recording all the conversations on all the phones.
[01:46:21.733 --> 01:46:23.715]  Well, that's not my understanding.
[01:46:23.795 --> 01:46:25.798]  It's being held by the telephone companies.
[01:46:25.818 --> 01:46:26.899]  That's not my understanding.
[01:46:26.919 --> 01:46:27.460]  They're doing it.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.585]  Well, I just heard Springer on the radio give a gold expose of the whole thing.
[01:46:31.605 --> 01:46:32.747]  Okay?
[01:46:33.177 --> 01:46:34.900]  No, they record phone conversations.
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:35.641]  Put him on hold.
[01:46:35.661 --> 01:46:36.942]  Put him on hold.
[01:46:37.523 --> 01:46:41.289]  They record when they get a keyword, then they start recording, sir.
[01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:43.331]  But they are monitoring everything.
[01:46:43.351 --> 01:46:44.473]  That's your free society.
[01:46:44.994 --> 01:46:46.456]  But you sound upset, so go ahead.
[01:46:47.313 --> 01:46:48.254]  It's not keywords.
[01:46:48.274 --> 01:46:49.255]  You keep saying keywords.
[01:46:49.335 --> 01:46:50.456]  It is not keywords.
[01:46:50.476 --> 01:46:52.418]  They are recording all the conversation.
[01:46:52.438 --> 01:46:53.599]  They have the power to do it.
[01:46:53.859 --> 01:46:55.721]  They have the megabytes to do it.
[01:46:57.182 --> 01:46:58.384]  Are you angry at me, sir?
[01:46:58.404 --> 01:46:59.805]  You keep talking about keywords.
[01:47:00.045 --> 01:47:01.086]  It's not keywords.
[01:47:01.146 --> 01:47:02.027]  Are you angry at me, sir?
[01:47:02.047 --> 01:47:02.267]  No.
[01:47:02.628 --> 01:47:03.689]  You keep talking.
[01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:07.492]  I am just trying to correct you because you keep talking about keywords.
[01:47:07.712 --> 01:47:08.713]  You always have.
[01:47:09.094 --> 01:47:10.315]  And that is not a fact.
[01:47:10.815 --> 01:47:11.195]  Okay.
[01:47:11.255 --> 01:47:12.676]  We don't care about keywords.
[01:47:13.676 --> 01:47:14.617]  Okay.
[01:47:14.737 --> 01:47:15.337]  All righty.
[01:47:15.977 --> 01:47:17.157]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.358]  Mr. Jones, could I add something?
[01:47:19.398 --> 01:47:19.698]  Sure.
[01:47:21.319 --> 01:47:33.804]  On March 15th, the Defense Agency opened up a new 23.4 billion yen wiretapping facility in one of the southern islands of Japan.
[01:47:33.824 --> 01:47:38.986]  Their mission has not been disclosed, but there you go.
[01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:39.606]  So...
[01:47:41.011 --> 01:47:53.262]  Well, you know, I've been studying the National Security Agency and the Echelon and the InfoPoll 9 system in Europe for a long time, and I wasn't trying to get combative with that caller, but he sounded extremely angry.
[01:47:53.282 --> 01:48:00.329]  And, yes, they have the computer space to record everything, and they do record quite a bit.
[01:48:00.849 --> 01:48:11.155]  But according to my knowledge, and you can believe Jerry Springer if you like, the bastion of fact, and I guess if he said it, it's God's word, but that's not my view.
[01:48:11.655 --> 01:48:18.278]  I mean, I'm the guy who took the heat for saying the NSA was listening and recording and hooked into every phone call in the country.
[01:48:18.819 --> 01:48:22.321]  I said that ten years ago because I had the law they passed.
[01:48:22.941 --> 01:48:26.223]  So now, again, I'm covering everything up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:26.243 --> 01:48:26.763]  I've been caught.
[01:48:27.446 --> 01:48:29.587]  I mean, it's as if I'm saying the government isn't bad.
[01:48:29.787 --> 01:48:32.448]  Professor, sorry that all these calls are on.
[01:48:32.468 --> 01:48:33.708]  No, no, no, not at all, not at all.
[01:48:34.128 --> 01:48:40.891]  But whether they are recording one word or keywords or the entire conversation, it's illegal.
[01:48:41.311 --> 01:48:42.031]  Yeah, it's illegal.
[01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:43.792]  It's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:48:44.752 --> 01:48:51.094]  And I never figure out why people don't get upset about something until it's in the front page of USA Today.
[01:48:52.143 --> 01:49:04.787]  And I have the USA Today article right here in front of us, and they are admitting that the phone companies are recording the records of the calls, and they're recording parts of the calls, but according to what I know from people that work at NSA, they were not recording everything.
[01:49:05.687 --> 01:49:08.768]  But you can't explain that to him, so it doesn't really matter.
[01:49:09.108 --> 01:49:10.749]  We're going to come back and take a few more calls.
[01:49:10.769 --> 01:49:19.752]  We'll see if John or Tom or Mike or anybody wants to specifically talk to our valiant guest who took action and got the truth out about 9-11 in a big, big way.
[01:49:21.974 --> 01:49:23.215]  I know it's frustrating, folks.
[01:49:23.235 --> 01:49:24.875]  You can't call up and yell at George Bush.
[01:49:24.895 --> 01:49:26.956]  You can't call up and yell at Hillary Clinton.
[01:49:26.976 --> 01:49:28.097]  So I'm here.
[01:49:28.317 --> 01:49:28.857]  I understand.
[01:49:28.897 --> 01:49:29.577]  It's all my fault.
[01:49:30.377 --> 01:49:32.118]  I'm covering up for the NSA now.
[01:49:32.778 --> 01:49:34.059]  Yes, that's what I've always done.
[01:49:34.999 --> 01:49:36.120]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:38.821]  We'll be back after this quick break.
[01:49:40.562 --> 01:49:45.023]  I bet when the transponders go in our cars to Texas, I'll get a call saying I'm covering that up, too.
[01:49:45.584 --> 01:49:47.304]  I've just been talking about it for 11 years.
[01:49:47.805 --> 01:49:48.225]  Stay with us.
[01:49:48.245 --> 01:49:48.805]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.059 --> 01:50:00.881]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.221 --> 01:50:02.581]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.781 --> 01:50:04.982]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.142 --> 01:50:07.223]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.503 --> 01:50:12.425]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.765 --> 01:50:16.806]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:17.046 --> 01:50:18.827]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.847 --> 01:50:29.549]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:31.590]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.810 --> 01:50:35.671]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:50:35.751 --> 01:50:37.331]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:57.183]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.523 --> 01:51:06.349]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.669 --> 01:51:11.353]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.813 --> 01:51:18.541]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.942 --> 01:51:30.716]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.176 --> 01:51:35.638]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:35.818 --> 01:51:38.138]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.590]  I think we're good to go.
[01:53:58.707 --> 01:54:07.493]  I didn't ask the professor during the break if he could stay a little bit with us in the next hour, but I know it's like 3 in the morning there now, Japan time, but he's an American living in Japan.
[01:54:07.533 --> 01:54:22.202]  Before we go back to John and Mike and Rita and Anthony and others, Doug and others, Professor, you told Kevin, one of my producers, a story about just how subservient the Japanese are, though, about how you came into the class...
[01:54:22.642 --> 01:54:22.902]  Absolutely.
[01:54:22.922 --> 01:54:28.626]  This is an experiment that I've done quite a number of times over the course of my 17-year career in Japan.
[01:54:28.646 --> 01:54:31.308]  I've done this type of experiment in various different ways.
[01:54:49.732 --> 01:54:59.400]  One way is me standing up in front of the class and saying, stand up, sit down, stand up, sit down, 10, 15, 20 times, and people are standing up and sitting down.
[01:54:59.921 --> 01:55:08.588]  Stand up, raise your arm, or raise your right arm, put your right arm down, you know, type of Simon Says, without any explanation, and everyone does it.
[01:55:09.108 --> 01:55:11.530]  And then, okay, sit down, and then I just go on with the lesson.
[01:55:12.549 --> 01:55:15.174]  No, no comment, no question, nothing.
[01:55:15.314 --> 01:55:15.995]  They just do it.
[01:55:16.556 --> 01:55:22.425]  Other times I've just sat in my chair at the front of the class and stared at people.
[01:55:23.307 --> 01:55:25.831]  Or I've sat on the side of the podium.
[01:55:27.858 --> 01:55:33.140]  Looking, you know, towards the window or towards the wall, the door.
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:38.621]  Do you later bring it up to them why you did it to show them?
[01:55:38.822 --> 01:55:39.302]  Exactly.
[01:55:39.662 --> 01:55:45.664]  After a couple of times doing this with various classes, saying, why?
[01:55:46.564 --> 01:55:47.964]  Didn't you think that was strange?
[01:55:48.004 --> 01:55:51.205]  And, of course, it's, well, no.
[01:55:51.605 --> 01:55:52.766]  Was it supposed to be strange?
[01:55:53.506 --> 01:55:55.387]  Well, maybe it was strange, but I'm not sure.
[01:55:55.407 --> 01:55:55.467]  But
[01:55:57.425 --> 01:56:17.058]  So you have one of the most intelligent, highest IQs, longest-lived population in the world, but they are imperially conditioned through thousands of years to be servants, to follow orders, to slit their wrists if they were ordered to, or jab a sword in their belly if they were ordered to in the past.
[01:56:17.478 --> 01:56:17.698]  It's true.
[01:56:17.718 --> 01:56:21.081]  You know, if you ask me, what do you think about the truth movement really succeeding in Japan?
[01:56:44.384 --> 01:56:45.885]  On one day I'll be very optimistic.
[01:56:45.925 --> 01:56:48.086]  On another day I'll be extremely pessimistic.
[01:56:48.206 --> 01:56:57.070]  And one of the reasons is because for me, Japan is a perfect place for the New World Order.
[01:56:58.210 --> 01:56:59.951]  It was made, packaged...
[01:57:00.646 --> 01:57:04.407]  For the New World Order to come in and to take over.
[01:57:05.827 --> 01:57:09.188]  And, you know, people will just allow it to happen.
[01:57:09.708 --> 01:57:14.009]  Professor, I know it's the middle of the night, but will you stay with us 21 minutes to take calls?
[01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.489]  Sure.
[01:57:14.769 --> 01:57:15.689]  Okay, fantastic.
[01:57:15.729 --> 01:57:20.710]  I promise we're going to go to your calls quickly, and you can bring up any topic you want, but it would be nice if you brought up 9-11.
[01:57:20.770 --> 01:57:27.812]  And it would be nice if you didn't basically bark at me for not covering the NSA properly.
[01:57:28.487 --> 01:57:31.188]  I mean, I get attacked for saying the NSA spies on us.
[01:57:33.809 --> 01:57:37.430]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:37.570 --> 01:57:37.890]  Big Brother.
[01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:38.631]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:39.331]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:39.411 --> 01:57:39.811]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.801 --> 01:57:57.702]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.722 --> 01:58:02.165]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.545 --> 01:58:06.648]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.208 --> 01:58:10.350]  Well, it's old news for this audience, but here's the headline.
[01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:13.972]  NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls.
[01:58:14.653 --> 01:58:16.774]  Your phone records, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:17.495 --> 01:58:18.075]  And more.
[01:58:18.155 --> 01:58:22.038]  We'll be getting into that, because it is breaking in the mainstream news.
[01:58:23.138 --> 01:58:27.684]  We are joined by Professor John F. Marcuso.
[01:58:27.704 --> 01:58:31.449]  He is an American from New York, living for 17 years in Japan.
[01:58:31.489 --> 01:58:37.016]  He was instrumental in the research and quoted in a major publication recently
[01:58:37.718 --> 01:58:42.882]  That in Tokyo, in Japan, that exposed 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:58:43.322 --> 01:58:44.844]  And right now, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:58:44.864 --> 01:58:46.345]  You'll be with us for another 20 minutes.
[01:58:46.825 --> 01:58:48.706]  Then I'll get into the NSA and all the rest of it.
[01:58:49.127 --> 01:58:50.888]  Right now, let's talk to John in Virginia.
[01:58:51.128 --> 01:58:51.889]  John, you're on the air.
[01:58:51.909 --> 01:58:52.289]  Go ahead.
[01:58:52.769 --> 01:58:53.310]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:53.690 --> 01:58:53.950]  Hi.
[01:58:54.191 --> 01:58:55.231]  Thanks for taking my call, man.
[01:58:55.451 --> 01:58:55.772]  Thank you.
[01:58:56.152 --> 01:59:01.736]  Hey, I want to relate this to 9-11 as best I can, but I also have a different subject.
[01:59:01.756 --> 01:59:02.337]  That's fine.
[01:59:02.397 --> 01:59:02.857]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:59:02.877 --> 01:59:02.977]  Okay.
[01:59:04.414 --> 01:59:12.568]  The best I can say about 9-11, I was put in a mental institution by a psychiatrist and a judge in Virginia, and the reason cited in court...
[01:59:13.246 --> 01:59:17.708]  As a justification for this, I believe that 9-11 was an act of the U.S.
[01:59:17.768 --> 01:59:18.228]  government.
[01:59:18.628 --> 01:59:34.954]  I have seen mainstream articles, it's got to be over 20 times, where people are committed for saying that, and people are even using it in divorce proceedings with people I know in Kansas City, in Los Angeles, people I know personally are having it used against them.
[01:59:34.974 --> 01:59:35.374]  Go ahead.
[01:59:36.134 --> 01:59:40.736]  Also that I believe that water fluoridation in the state of Virginia
[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:43.161]  It's a very dangerous practice.
[01:59:43.681 --> 01:59:44.982]  They also cited that in court.
[01:59:45.022 --> 01:59:45.602]  Funny.
[01:59:46.503 --> 01:59:51.046]  The Irish government, a bunch of other major governments have banned it, saying it's poisonous.
[01:59:51.406 --> 01:59:52.066]  Absolutely.
[01:59:52.366 --> 01:59:54.608]  I guess they all need to be put in mental institutions, too.
[01:59:54.628 --> 02:00:02.512]  You know, they drug me so badly against my will that I couldn't even think or speak on my own behalf.
[02:00:02.652 --> 02:00:05.313]  Well, the Soviets did that, and now they're doing that in America.
[02:00:05.354 --> 02:00:06.814]  Let me get a comment from the professor.
[02:00:06.834 --> 02:00:07.255]  Go ahead.
[02:00:07.315 --> 02:00:07.875]  Give us your take.
[02:00:08.672 --> 02:00:09.352]  It's outrageous.
[02:00:11.294 --> 02:00:15.656]  Thankfully, Japanese don't fluoride their water over here.
[02:00:15.676 --> 02:00:18.077]  It's very scary.
[02:00:18.338 --> 02:00:18.658]  Scary.
[02:00:20.539 --> 02:00:22.400]  My heart goes out to this gentleman.
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:24.041]  So how did you finally get out?
[02:00:24.081 --> 02:00:26.783]  Did you say, I don't believe it was an inside job.
[02:00:27.143 --> 02:00:29.904]  I love George W. And they said, you are cured.
[02:00:30.044 --> 02:00:31.405]  You know, you want to know what, Alex?
[02:00:31.745 --> 02:00:37.909]  At the point after they had drugged me for a month, I couldn't even hold my own beliefs at that point.
[02:00:38.382 --> 02:00:42.086]  And I was agreeing with him because I was so brainwashed by the drugs.
[02:00:42.327 --> 02:00:43.868]  I'm interested how this happened.
[02:00:43.928 --> 02:00:45.210]  I mean, who reported you?
[02:00:45.250 --> 02:00:46.992]  How did they grab you?
[02:00:47.052 --> 02:00:47.572]  There you go.
[02:00:47.632 --> 02:00:52.538]  I mean, everything you've talked about with the parents and the social engineering of society.
[02:00:52.598 --> 02:00:58.745]  My mother called the police because I voiced some concerns that the government was watching me due to my political activism, such as
[02:00:59.315 --> 02:01:07.564]  Wait a minute, that was in a newspaper.
[02:01:07.744 --> 02:01:09.145]  I remember when you did that.
[02:01:10.987 --> 02:01:11.508]  In Virginia?
[02:01:11.528 --> 02:01:17.154]  I remember another case of a guy who did that, and they grabbed him, and it was in a newspaper.
[02:01:17.174 --> 02:01:20.077]  I was in a newspaper.
[02:01:20.097 --> 02:01:22.019]  They had a picture of me, but it wasn't actually a...
[02:01:23.449 --> 02:01:27.832]  There was another very similar case, and I think that was in Wisconsin.
[02:01:27.852 --> 02:01:37.119]  Yeah, well, I have a Supreme Court case pending in the state of Virginia where the judge initially tried to deny me my right to a jury trial for a malpractice suit for this very reason.
[02:01:37.159 --> 02:01:39.141]  Oh, interesting.
[02:01:39.161 --> 02:01:39.621]  Interesting.
[02:01:39.861 --> 02:01:40.822]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:41.062 --> 02:01:41.763]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:42.083 --> 02:01:42.483]  You bet.
[02:01:42.523 --> 02:01:42.924]  Thank you.
[02:01:43.184 --> 02:01:44.545]  Let's talk to Mike in Ohio.
[02:01:44.585 --> 02:01:45.225]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:01:47.287 --> 02:01:47.907]  Yeah, hello, Al.
[02:01:48.248 --> 02:01:48.908]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:48.948 --> 02:01:50.509]  How's Professor John doing?
[02:01:50.850 --> 02:01:51.670]  He's doing fine.
[02:01:51.970 --> 02:01:52.571]  I'm here with him.
[02:01:53.331 --> 02:02:06.983]  Well, saying about this monitoring people's calls, now that we started the war in Iraq, we can't underestimate any of their family members here may be retaliating.
[02:02:07.003 --> 02:02:07.824]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:02:07.864 --> 02:02:08.525]  Retaliating.
[02:02:10.006 --> 02:02:11.087]  I don't understand, no.
[02:02:11.447 --> 02:02:12.408]  Why don't you explain it to me?
[02:02:12.428 --> 02:02:18.674]  I'm saying that you can't underestimate any Iraqi or Afghanistan people living here trying to retaliate.
[02:02:19.244 --> 02:02:22.286]  So you think the spying is good, it's to keep us safe from the Arabs?
[02:02:22.806 --> 02:02:23.726]  They may retaliate.
[02:02:23.827 --> 02:02:24.367]  Well, stay there.
[02:02:24.407 --> 02:02:25.627]  I want to talk to you on the other side.
[02:02:26.328 --> 02:02:26.708]  Stay there.
[02:02:27.028 --> 02:02:32.811]  So maybe the Fourth Amendment needs to go bye-bye, and maybe it's been bad all along and George Bush is just saving us.
[02:02:34.132 --> 02:02:44.217]  We'll be right back with our guest, the professor, and then we'll let Mike at Ohio finish up about his views on the spying, and Rita, Anthony, and others.
[02:02:47.205 --> 02:02:50.046]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.306 --> 02:02:51.886]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.226 --> 02:02:56.907]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.247 --> 02:03:01.669]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:06.290]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:09.310]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:11.911]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:03:12.131 --> 02:03:18.696]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.936 --> 02:03:26.161]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.421 --> 02:03:28.843]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:29.003 --> 02:03:30.785]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:03:30.805 --> 02:03:31.105]  1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:46.951 --> 02:03:49.972]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:50.312 --> 02:03:59.114]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:59.454 --> 02:04:04.115]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:04.595 --> 02:04:11.323]  The Berkey Light is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:11.723 --> 02:04:23.517]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:23.977 --> 02:04:28.420]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:04:34.204 --> 02:04:35.665]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:35.685 --> 02:04:36.726]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.101 --> 02:04:48.163]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:04:48.383 --> 02:04:50.604]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:04:50.925 --> 02:04:51.605]  New toenails?
[02:04:51.985 --> 02:04:52.966]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:04:53.947 --> 02:04:56.609]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[02:04:57.168 --> 02:04:58.589]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:04:58.990 --> 02:05:01.392]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:05:01.632 --> 02:05:02.993]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:05:03.013 --> 02:05:05.115]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:05:05.275 --> 02:05:06.637]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:05:06.697 --> 02:05:09.499]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:05:09.719 --> 02:05:10.981]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:05:11.541 --> 02:05:12.562]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:13.042 --> 02:05:17.126]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:05:17.827 --> 02:05:18.728]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:05:18.988 --> 02:05:21.530]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:23.452]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:05:23.912 --> 02:05:27.014]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:05:27.394 --> 02:05:27.954]  You bet.
[02:05:28.174 --> 02:05:32.276]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[02:05:32.416 --> 02:05:33.957]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:34.337 --> 02:05:35.478]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:05:35.658 --> 02:05:37.319]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[02:05:37.679 --> 02:05:42.781]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[02:05:42.981 --> 02:05:43.982]  In the foot care section.
[02:05:50.834 --> 02:05:51.494]  Big Brother.
[02:05:52.134 --> 02:05:53.235]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.915 --> 02:05:55.035]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.655 --> 02:05:56.535]  You want answers?
[02:05:57.236 --> 02:05:58.776]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.816 --> 02:06:02.757]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.997 --> 02:06:07.118]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.058 --> 02:06:12.739]  In China, they enslaved the people to keep them safe from terrorists and criminals.
[02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:15.860]  In Nazi Germany, they did as well.
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:18.921]  In Communist Russia, in Cuba today...
[02:06:20.066 --> 02:06:22.967]  It's all for your own safety, your own good.
[02:06:23.027 --> 02:06:26.408]  Oh, we have to torture people so Al-Qaeda doesn't attack again.
[02:06:27.148 --> 02:06:30.169]  Oh, we have to spy on you so Al-Qaeda doesn't get you.
[02:06:30.789 --> 02:06:31.869]  Oh, I'm above the law.
[02:06:31.929 --> 02:06:32.829]  I'm President Bush.
[02:06:32.889 --> 02:06:39.991]  I don't need warrants to spy anymore, even if they're blank check warrants that are received after the fact from the FISA court.
[02:06:41.132 --> 02:06:46.074]  And of course, what a year ago, Bush gave speeches saying, don't worry, we don't spy on you without warrants.
[02:06:46.094 --> 02:06:47.714]  Then he gets caught spying without warrants.
[02:06:47.734 --> 02:06:50.375]  He says, I don't need no stinking warrants, as they say.
[02:06:50.955 --> 02:06:53.796]  We're talking to Professor John F. Mancuso.
[02:06:55.377 --> 02:06:59.598]  He hails from New York, but now lives the last 17 years in Japan as a professor there.
[02:06:59.618 --> 02:07:04.300]  And he's been exposing 9-11 and gotten a big national piece written up in one of their big publications.
[02:07:04.986 --> 02:07:05.446]  We're good to go.
[02:07:34.242 --> 02:07:40.467]  All of this spying and the rest of it is shown to be the fraud it is once you realize that 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:07:40.507 --> 02:07:45.892]  But some people will admit 9-11 is an inside job, but then still say that the Arabs are some type of threat.
[02:07:45.932 --> 02:07:54.799]  Well, listen, even if they are a threat, I'm a lot more afraid of a tyrannical centralized government here domestically, history shows, than I should be of some foreigners.
[02:07:55.660 --> 02:08:00.284]  But, Professor, before we go back to Mike in Ohio, do you want to comment on the things he was saying last segment?
[02:08:03.689 --> 02:08:04.490]  Where do you start?
[02:08:04.530 --> 02:08:07.514]  I mean, Mr. Jones, you said it perfectly right.
[02:08:07.554 --> 02:08:10.318]  We have to fear the government taking away our guns and our liberties.
[02:08:10.338 --> 02:08:11.559]  And, of course, creating...
[02:08:17.527 --> 02:08:23.730]  Creating the boogeyman and pointing the finger and saying, hey, they are the ones to blame.
[02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:26.351]  But that's what George Washington and Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:08:26.371 --> 02:08:27.551]  They said, don't trust the government.
[02:08:27.571 --> 02:08:28.372]  It's the most dangerous.
[02:08:28.772 --> 02:08:29.752]  But they're wrong.
[02:08:29.812 --> 02:08:31.613]  They didn't face Al-Qaeda.
[02:08:32.774 --> 02:08:35.014]  Mike, go ahead and finish up your points from Ohio.
[02:08:35.034 --> 02:08:36.095]  I mean, do you disagree with us?
[02:08:37.616 --> 02:08:38.236]  In ways I do.
[02:08:38.696 --> 02:08:40.337]  I think you can't underestimate.
[02:08:40.377 --> 02:08:41.277]  They may retaliate.
[02:08:41.377 --> 02:08:43.598]  I'm talking about people that probably lived here.
[02:08:43.618 --> 02:08:45.459]  They're from Iraq or Afghanistan.
[02:08:45.499 --> 02:08:45.619]  They
[02:08:46.075 --> 02:08:47.558]  They have the technical know-how.
[02:08:48.179 --> 02:08:51.907]  Personally, I've been threatened by Middle Easterners over the years, so they may retaliate.
[02:08:51.947 --> 02:08:53.971]  Who do you think carried out the 9-11 attacks?
[02:08:55.254 --> 02:08:55.815]  Our own government.
[02:08:57.724 --> 02:08:59.746]  This is classic, folks.
[02:08:59.766 --> 02:09:00.707]  This is double-think.
[02:09:01.067 --> 02:09:02.548]  And Mike, you sound like a nice guy.
[02:09:02.809 --> 02:09:10.955]  You know our own government, that is small criminal elements, not the whole government, is involved in terror attacks, working with other intelligence agencies, clearly.
[02:09:11.436 --> 02:09:16.080]  That's going on, but at the same time, you're worried the Middle Easterners are going to get you.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:22.805]  Well, you've got your Second Amendment to deal with them, and if our own government's carrying out attacks, they'd love to provocateur Arabs into doing it.
[02:09:23.586 --> 02:09:28.450]  In 1993, they cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, and really carried out the first World Trade Center attack.
[02:09:28.730 --> 02:09:33.213]  So you better be worried about the government actually supporting real homegrown terrorists, sir.
[02:09:34.214 --> 02:09:34.594]  You're right.
[02:09:34.855 --> 02:09:36.676]  This spying is totally un-American.
[02:09:37.717 --> 02:09:41.540]  Well, if Middle East replaces a bomb in a building, what are you going to do?
[02:09:43.429 --> 02:09:45.870]  But we have a government that carries out terror attacks.
[02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:46.550]  You admit that.
[02:09:46.891 --> 02:09:52.833]  But now if they hear a Middle Easterner planning some organic attack, which I'm not saying couldn't happen.
[02:09:52.853 --> 02:09:56.154]  There could be real Middle Easterners that might do something.
[02:09:56.174 --> 02:09:57.614]  I think that's on the low end.
[02:09:57.674 --> 02:10:03.376]  But the point is, you think the government that will attack us to get control would then stop them with this spying?
[02:10:03.436 --> 02:10:03.756]  No, sir.
[02:10:04.036 --> 02:10:09.198]  This spying is on peace groups, gun groups, land rights organizations.
[02:10:09.258 --> 02:10:11.159]  That's what's in their own handbooks, sir.
[02:10:13.047 --> 02:10:16.610]  So who do we contact if we do get threatened by a Middle Easterner?
[02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:18.832]  Well, you contact the police, sir.
[02:10:18.872 --> 02:10:21.994]  If someone threatens you with bodily harm, that's illegal.
[02:10:22.174 --> 02:10:25.277]  The NSA isn't going to save you spying on everyone.
[02:10:26.278 --> 02:10:30.462]  I've had Middle Easterners threaten me before, over a 30-year period.
[02:10:30.482 --> 02:10:33.905]  And I've asked people about that.
[02:10:33.985 --> 02:10:34.945]  No, that couldn't happen.
[02:10:35.846 --> 02:10:40.130]  Well, I mean, I've never had a Middle Easterner threaten me, but I'm sure Middle Easterners do threaten people.
[02:10:41.462 --> 02:10:43.624]  So who do you go to when they say, well, that couldn't happen?
[02:10:44.525 --> 02:10:47.268]  Well, if somebody threatens me, I'm going to try to defend myself.
[02:10:47.348 --> 02:10:51.672]  Listen, I don't dial 911 until I've got the gun in my hand.
[02:10:52.293 --> 02:10:54.875]  I'm not going to count on the police to come save me.
[02:10:55.416 --> 02:10:58.479]  And they've ruled in court hundreds of times it's not their responsibility.
[02:10:58.979 --> 02:11:04.345]  Well, don't you deny that the Koran does say in a lot of their religions that they have the right to kill anybody for Allah?
[02:11:05.759 --> 02:11:25.012]  I have actually read a lot of the Koran, sir, and the Koran does have a lot of passages like that, but it also has other passages in it, and they've done national polls in Middle Eastern countries, and on average, 6% of the Muslims are the crazy, blow-themselves-up type, and that's still a big group of people out of a billion, 200 million Muslims.
[02:11:25.792 --> 02:11:28.974]  But, again, sir, I think you're all mixed up.
[02:11:29.014 --> 02:11:29.815]  Professor, comments?
[02:11:30.575 --> 02:11:33.237]  You know, I spent a year in Saudi Arabia, and
[02:11:35.251 --> 02:11:44.614]  And this was in 1987, I believe, right after the first Mecca riots.
[02:11:45.554 --> 02:11:48.075]  And I was afraid, to be honest with you, I was afraid to go at first.
[02:11:49.055 --> 02:11:58.438]  I had already signed a contract with the Saudi government to go there as an English teacher and an interpreter, English and Spanish, for the Saudi government.
[02:11:59.561 --> 02:12:09.306]  I have to say that it was one of the most magnificent experiences of my entire life, meeting not just Saudis, but Kuwaitis and the Iraqis and Iranians.
[02:12:09.547 --> 02:12:16.670]  You know, you name people from the Middle East and, of course, Muslim countries in Africa and, of course, North Africa.
[02:12:17.371 --> 02:12:21.993]  These are warm, hospitable people.
[02:12:22.013 --> 02:12:22.694]  Yeah.
[02:12:24.157 --> 02:12:27.159]  You can find horrible elements in every culture.
[02:12:27.179 --> 02:12:34.804]  No, I've read the Quran, but these are these kind of twisted interpretations of it.
[02:12:34.824 --> 02:12:36.865]  99.9% of Muslims are magnificent people.
[02:12:42.859 --> 02:12:45.181]  And I have first hand since I lived there for a year.
[02:12:45.441 --> 02:12:46.862]  Mike, I appreciate your call.
[02:12:47.363 --> 02:12:55.790]  But let me just say this, and I'm not trying to attack Mike, but he thinks the government carried out the attacks, but he wants the government to spy on everybody to keep us safe from Muslims.
[02:12:56.250 --> 02:12:57.551]  I went to college with Muslims.
[02:12:57.711 --> 02:12:59.012]  I went to high school with Muslims.
[02:12:59.072 --> 02:13:00.273]  I lifted weights with Muslims.
[02:13:00.854 --> 02:13:06.098]  And I have to be honest with you, I have found them to be some of the nicest, most honest, friendly people.
[02:13:06.118 --> 02:13:06.899]  Now, I'm a Christian.
[02:13:07.489 --> 02:13:08.110]  I completely agree.
[02:13:08.130 --> 02:13:09.391]  I have never been more welcome in any country
[02:13:36.903 --> 02:13:39.625]  Than I was when I spent a year in Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:39.965 --> 02:13:41.386]  They were magnificent people.
[02:13:43.028 --> 02:13:48.392]  The greatest hosts I've ever had the privilege of being hosted by.
[02:13:49.873 --> 02:13:52.294]  Yeah, I'm told they put Texas hospitality to shame.
[02:13:55.677 --> 02:13:59.380]  Well, I was welcomed when I was in Texas for the couple of days that I was there.
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:13:59.820]  It was great.
[02:14:01.047 --> 02:14:12.016]  Well, my point is that any culture that comes out of a dangerous, wild terrain, normally, historically, if you look at it at a sociological level, is normally very hospitality-oriented.
[02:14:12.056 --> 02:14:13.337]  It's a survival mechanism.
[02:14:13.777 --> 02:14:15.718]  And then it gets ingrained in the culture and people.
[02:14:15.738 --> 02:14:22.663]  And the interesting thing about Saudi Arabia is that they consider any foreigner to be their guest.
[02:14:22.904 --> 02:14:25.966]  And they treat you as an honored guest.
[02:14:27.627 --> 02:14:28.388]  And I...
[02:14:29.711 --> 02:14:31.852]  It was the greatest year of my life.
[02:14:33.552 --> 02:14:35.852]  Well, you're not going to hear that from the neocons.
[02:14:35.872 --> 02:14:41.734]  They're just all out to kill us any minute, and it's all over, and they just can't wait to kill us.
[02:14:42.294 --> 02:14:42.954]  And it's bad.
[02:14:43.694 --> 02:14:44.154]  But it's funny.
[02:14:44.174 --> 02:14:55.417]  You've got huge Christian populations all over the Middle East, and only where the CIA goes in and radicalizes the Muslims, quote, as an anti-Commie arm, is where you get the problems.
[02:14:56.278 --> 02:14:57.839]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:14:57.859 --> 02:14:59.320]  Let's talk to Rita in Illinois.
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:00.041]  Rita, go ahead.
[02:15:01.022 --> 02:15:03.643]  Howdy, Alex and Professor.
[02:15:03.663 --> 02:15:05.885]  I was just looking at some stuff.
[02:15:05.945 --> 02:15:09.267]  I was the one that hung up the other day, but I didn't hear you seem to hang up.
[02:15:09.888 --> 02:15:10.388]  That's okay.
[02:15:10.428 --> 02:15:12.490]  We missed your call the other day.
[02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:13.350]  You're on the air now.
[02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:13.611]  Okay.
[02:15:13.631 --> 02:15:13.991]  All right.
[02:15:14.631 --> 02:15:15.252]  I've been looking.
[02:15:15.272 --> 02:15:22.737]  I taped a lot of things around Y2K, you know, and I had these tapes on the side, and I've been looking at a lot of things that they put out.
[02:15:22.777 --> 02:15:24.058]  They've been snitching on themselves.
[02:15:25.783 --> 02:15:35.018]  One thing is that I have this gentleman named David Yergin made this documentary for PBS called Commanding Heights where they snitch on themselves all the way through.
[02:15:35.038 --> 02:15:39.345]  I thought, wow, if Alex Jones saw this, you could just edit this thing and hang him with it.
[02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:48.293]  Well, do me a favor, send it to them, because in the year and a half before 9-11, they were all over TV saying the terrorists are going to attack.
[02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:51.014]  When they attack, you have to give up all your rights.
[02:15:51.494 --> 02:15:52.755]  Martial law is good.
[02:15:52.775 --> 02:15:53.935]  Is that what's on your tape?
[02:15:54.495 --> 02:15:56.096]  Well, not exactly, no.
[02:15:56.456 --> 02:16:04.479]  This is where they identify that Vladimir Lenin said that the big thing that you need is the commanding heights.
[02:16:05.368 --> 02:16:06.690]  And how they stole it.
[02:16:06.730 --> 02:16:14.980]  They go through this whole thing where they go through the entire globe and they're stealing the commanding heights, which is the resources from every nation, the guys who did it.
[02:16:16.138 --> 02:16:19.940]  At the end of it all, they say what we've got now is an economy with nobody in control.
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:23.842]  So it's like this insane economy where no one's in control.
[02:16:24.283 --> 02:16:26.364]  Well, I disagree with that.
[02:16:26.384 --> 02:16:30.926]  The globalists used modern mercantilism to create a neo-feudalist plantation.
[02:16:30.946 --> 02:16:33.567]  Well, that's their PR anyway, is that how wonderful it was.
[02:16:33.627 --> 02:16:41.071]  Every time they destabilize somebody's currency and then get them hooked on the juice loans, they have this magic music like, you know, a chia plant has grown.
[02:16:41.111 --> 02:16:42.092]  Look at this magic.
[02:16:42.192 --> 02:16:44.493]  The economy went better after we took it over.
[02:16:45.257 --> 02:16:48.818]  And they annihilate every... Which isn't true.
[02:16:48.858 --> 02:16:50.579]  Look at Argentina and everybody else.
[02:16:50.599 --> 02:16:52.680]  Oh, it's horrible.
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:57.342]  Their own IMF plans brag about how they destroy economies by design.
[02:16:57.362 --> 02:16:59.262]  Oh, it's horrific, but they make it look good.
[02:16:59.322 --> 02:17:02.744]  They try to make it look wonderful, but it's obviously not wonderful.
[02:17:02.964 --> 02:17:11.387]  And they show people revolting all around the world, and then they say, well, we were having some big problems, but then September 11th happened, and what can you do?
[02:17:12.034 --> 02:17:14.097]  You know, so now we're back on track.
[02:17:14.377 --> 02:17:16.559]  Okay, Rita, send me that tape, okay?
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:18.922]  It's very fuzzy because I recorded it on SP.
[02:17:18.982 --> 02:17:21.105]  I didn't have a very good antenna at the time.
[02:17:21.798 --> 02:17:22.498]  Okay, thank you.
[02:17:23.039 --> 02:17:24.079]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:17:24.139 --> 02:17:29.182]  Professor, do one more segment with us and I'll let you go to sleep, but I want to be able to finish up with you.
[02:17:29.242 --> 02:17:35.225]  The calls are just, they're always great, but sometimes they just refuse to talk about the topic, which is alright.
[02:17:35.265 --> 02:17:43.330]  It takes us in different directions, but I wanted you to be able to finish up on 9-11 and the awakening that's happening all over the planet when we give back our final segment with the professor.
[02:17:47.026 --> 02:17:56.090]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trianethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:17:56.331 --> 02:18:05.355]  Black Fergie elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[02:18:05.635 --> 02:18:07.577]  ...into delicious crystal-clear drinking water.
[02:18:07.897 --> 02:18:13.621]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:18:13.861 --> 02:18:20.506]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:20.726 --> 02:18:27.551]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:27.832 --> 02:18:29.593]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:18:29.853 --> 02:18:31.915]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:18:32.135 --> 02:18:33.075]  Get a two-pack for only $96...
[02:18:33.996 --> 02:18:35.198]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:46.540]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:51.381]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:18:51.561 --> 02:18:59.363]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:18:59.623 --> 02:19:04.984]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:19:05.204 --> 02:19:12.186]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:19:12.426 --> 02:19:12.906]  We're good to go.
[02:19:31.073 --> 02:19:37.336]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:19:37.636 --> 02:19:40.538]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:40.578 --> 02:19:43.779]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:48.641]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.922 --> 02:19:57.886]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[02:19:58.661 --> 02:20:04.806]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:20:05.607 --> 02:20:15.576]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[02:20:16.388 --> 02:20:23.532]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:24.252 --> 02:20:25.713]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.813 --> 02:20:27.074]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[02:20:27.254 --> 02:20:27.954]  Call now.
[02:20:27.994 --> 02:20:31.256]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:31.276 --> 02:20:31.996]  Gas prices are out
[02:20:45.657 --> 02:20:49.622]  If you want to save money at the pump and get back in the driver's seat, then listen closely.
[02:20:49.682 --> 02:20:53.628]  There is now a way to save up to 30% or more on your fuel bill using the MPG cap.
[02:21:00.797 --> 02:21:05.841]  The MPG cap is a capsule that looks like a vitamin that you simply drop into your gas tank.
[02:21:05.961 --> 02:21:10.685]  It's organic, non-toxic, EPA approved, and can drastically reduce fuel emissions.
[02:21:10.865 --> 02:21:18.771]  People all across the nation are reporting improved performance as well as the money saving increases in their gas mileage by using our MPG caps.
[02:21:19.391 --> 02:21:19.932]  That's 800-526-1778.
[02:21:19.952 --> 02:21:21.993]  Or visit the webpage at mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:22.013 --> 02:21:22.573]  That's mpgbiz.com.
[02:21:50.009 --> 02:21:59.715]  I've got several audio clips concerning Bush being above the law and some of the hypocritical things he's been saying and doing concerning General Michael V. Hayden coming up in the next segment.
[02:21:59.735 --> 02:22:03.897]  We'll also get into NSA has massive database of America's phone calls.
[02:22:03.937 --> 02:22:05.198]  This is from USA Today.
[02:22:05.738 --> 02:22:06.939]  It's self a whitewash.
[02:22:07.559 --> 02:22:14.063]  Our final segment, we'll get to your calls coming up in the next segment, with Professor John F. Marcuseau.
[02:22:15.578 --> 02:22:17.319]  John, it's been really great having you on.
[02:22:17.379 --> 02:22:22.262]  Again, I can only commend you for getting a big national piece done there in Japan.
[02:22:22.282 --> 02:22:24.203]  Do you have hope for the future?
[02:22:24.243 --> 02:22:27.405]  What do you see happening in the future if you look into your crystal ball?
[02:22:28.625 --> 02:22:28.946]  Wow.
[02:22:28.966 --> 02:22:31.327]  That's a tough question.
[02:22:32.856 --> 02:22:36.318]  As I mentioned before, it depends upon the day that you ask me.
[02:22:36.358 --> 02:22:39.179]  Some days I'm really pessimistic, other days I'm very optimistic.
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:44.762]  I think I'm optimistic by nature, however, even though I am a pretty jaded New Yorker.
[02:22:47.323 --> 02:22:50.585]  The Japanese are waking up, there's no question about that.
[02:22:51.324 --> 02:23:06.008]  And the legislation that is being enacted by the Japanese government to try to quash whatever grassroots movement is taking hold right now is accelerating.
[02:23:06.028 --> 02:23:07.308]  It's scary.
[02:23:07.928 --> 02:23:16.451]  However, just my students and the people that I meet on the street and people that I meet on the train, they know what's happening.
[02:23:16.491 --> 02:23:16.931]  They are...
[02:23:18.370 --> 02:23:18.750]  I think so.
[02:23:39.082 --> 02:23:40.863]  That inspired me.
[02:23:41.323 --> 02:23:43.565]  That's how I got into all of this.
[02:23:44.185 --> 02:23:53.151]  I saw your documentaries, took a look at your website, listened to you on the GCN network by the Internet feed.
[02:23:54.932 --> 02:23:58.414]  So you are really the inspiration.
[02:23:58.474 --> 02:24:04.598]  And so people like you getting other people involved, so that does give me hope.
[02:24:06.152 --> 02:24:11.838]  Well, Professor, it's statements like that that make me feel good at a certain level, but at another, it's a great weight.
[02:24:11.878 --> 02:24:17.825]  It's like the little statement in Spider-Man, with great power comes great responsibility.
[02:24:17.865 --> 02:24:21.449]  And I just want the listeners to realize that many of you are smarter than I am.
[02:24:21.909 --> 02:24:23.251]  You're more informed than I am.
[02:24:23.271 --> 02:24:24.572]  You're more eloquent than I am.
[02:24:25.233 --> 02:24:27.035]  And, you know, be like the good professor.
[02:24:27.717 --> 02:24:29.278]  I think we're good to go.
[02:24:51.783 --> 02:24:52.444]  We're good to go.
[02:24:52.524 --> 02:24:52.684]  I think?
[02:25:09.298 --> 02:25:10.019]  They're arrogant.
[02:25:10.059 --> 02:25:10.979]  They think we're stupid.
[02:25:11.019 --> 02:25:12.560]  They think they're only going to win.
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:13.901]  I got news for them.
[02:25:13.941 --> 02:25:16.142]  They can keep reapplying their lies every day.
[02:25:16.642 --> 02:25:18.964]  Once somebody's eyes are open, there's no going back.
[02:25:19.424 --> 02:25:21.886]  Once you turn somebody on to the truth, there's no going back.
[02:25:21.966 --> 02:25:24.907]  And that domino effect has already been triggered.
[02:25:25.308 --> 02:25:26.508]  And I know we're going to win this thing.
[02:25:26.528 --> 02:25:27.929]  There's going to be hard times ahead.
[02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:36.054]  But in the end, the good guys always do come out on top because evil implodes because of its own nature, its own weight.
[02:25:36.764 --> 02:25:38.566]  And, Professor, I commend you.
[02:25:38.586 --> 02:25:47.173]  Now, I guess, what's the best way for people to find... We have a link to it right now on InfoWars.com, but what's another way for people to find the Tokyo Journal?
[02:25:48.414 --> 02:25:55.581]  Well, it's Tokyo... It's TokyoJournal.t, as in Tom O. TokyoJournal.to.
[02:25:55.901 --> 02:25:59.844]  Or just, you know, Google Tokyo Journal.
[02:26:00.805 --> 02:26:02.727]  Tokyo Journal 9-11, and you'll find it.
[02:26:02.747 --> 02:26:02.807]  Yes.
[02:26:05.006 --> 02:26:06.747]  Well, I'll let you get some sleep.
[02:26:06.807 --> 02:26:09.167]  Are you going to be teaching students at college tomorrow?
[02:26:09.708 --> 02:26:10.168]  Yes.
[02:26:10.928 --> 02:26:12.568]  I have to get up in two and a half hours.
[02:26:13.809 --> 02:26:14.909]  Where do you live in Tokyo?
[02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:19.991]  Well, in a place called Kunitachi.
[02:26:22.872 --> 02:26:25.513]  Tokyo is a huge megalopolis.
[02:26:25.533 --> 02:26:28.534]  It goes on for about 60 miles around.
[02:26:29.754 --> 02:26:32.835]  And I live in a small suburb of the city.
[02:26:33.470 --> 02:26:34.971]  How long does it take for you to get to work?
[02:26:35.992 --> 02:26:36.472]  Oh, no, no.
[02:26:36.492 --> 02:26:41.035]  I essentially live on campus, so I just basically roll out of bed and say, well, look, I'm sorry.
[02:26:41.055 --> 02:26:46.458]  I was talking to, you know, Alex Jones last night, so forgive me for not shaving.
[02:26:46.818 --> 02:26:49.000]  Well, Professor, we really appreciate you joining us.
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:53.763]  What's it like living in smaller accommodations than we do here in the U.S.?
[02:26:54.583 --> 02:26:55.224]  You get used to it.
[02:26:55.404 --> 02:26:56.124]  You get used to it.
[02:26:57.065 --> 02:26:59.046]  And you get to know your neighbors really well.
[02:26:59.326 --> 02:27:00.127]  How big is your house?
[02:27:02.894 --> 02:27:06.055]  Probably about as big as your bathroom.
[02:27:06.376 --> 02:27:09.877]  It's not very big at all.
[02:27:10.078 --> 02:27:14.220]  It's about 50 square meters, which I'm not sure what that is in feet.
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:19.643]  Well, you know, no matter how big your house is, they say you always end up living in two rooms anyways.
[02:27:20.763 --> 02:27:21.384]  I believe that.
[02:27:21.904 --> 02:27:22.264]  All right.
[02:27:22.925 --> 02:27:25.506]  Professor John F. Marcuso, thank you for joining us.
[02:27:25.546 --> 02:27:26.346]  Thanks for your courage.
[02:27:27.287 --> 02:27:28.508]  Mr. Jones, it was a pleasure.
[02:27:29.108 --> 02:27:30.309]  We'll talk to you again in the future.
[02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.809]  God bless.
[02:27:31.437 --> 02:27:33.380]  We'll come back and do a bunch of other news in your calls.
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:33.801]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.445 --> 02:27:37.346]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.847 --> 02:27:39.450]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.371 --> 02:27:43.076]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.727 --> 02:27:53.609]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:53.749 --> 02:28:06.673]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:28:06.853 --> 02:28:08.634]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:28:08.814 --> 02:28:12.275]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:28:12.555 --> 02:28:16.337]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:28:16.597 --> 02:28:21.559]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:28:21.839 --> 02:28:23.539]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:27.781]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:28:28.041 --> 02:28:29.842]  Zango is what you are looking for.
[02:28:29.862 --> 02:28:32.623]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit mangosteenmarkets.com.

[02:28:57.572 --> 02:29:01.877]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:29:02.217 --> 02:29:05.240]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:05.540 --> 02:29:08.984]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:29:09.284 --> 02:29:18.569]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.609 --> 02:29:22.091]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:22.331 --> 02:29:29.455]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:30:47.291 --> 02:30:50.314]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents...
[02:30:51.584 --> 02:30:52.464]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:53.105 --> 02:30:55.586]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:57.246 --> 02:31:00.148]  I got three clips I want to play and comment on.
[02:31:01.328 --> 02:31:03.669]  One is from Countdown on MSNBC.
[02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:05.970]  We've interviewed him before.
[02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:12.713]  Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law expert, unloaded on President Bush during a segment of Countdown last night.
[02:31:12.753 --> 02:31:17.795]  He's been critical before, but this clip currently calls attention to the fact that Bush likes hiring...
[02:31:18.789 --> 02:31:24.693]  Officials who have either been convicted of or pled guilty to crimes or others who should have been indicted.
[02:31:24.733 --> 02:31:29.856]  He also rakes General Hayden over the coals and talks about this new criminal form of government.
[02:31:30.236 --> 02:31:31.137]  And that's what it is.
[02:31:31.277 --> 02:31:35.339]  Criminal dictatorship is being announced.
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:38.381]  So let's go ahead and roll this historical clip.
[02:31:38.441 --> 02:31:41.203]  The truth finally comes out on national television.
[02:31:42.105 --> 02:31:45.868]  If not counterintuitive, with disapproval numbers now rivaling Richard Nixon's.
[02:31:46.209 --> 02:31:54.956]  Mr. Bush still nominated for his new CIA chief, a man almost guaranteed to draw a confirmation fight, General Michael Hayden, creator of the domestic eavesdropping program.
[02:31:55.276 --> 02:32:08.608]  Mr. Bush says General Hayden is perfect for the CIA and perhaps he was chosen for elevation despite or because of a characteristic that is normally seen as a liability, his arguable willingness to thumb his nose at constitutional law.
[02:32:09.048 --> 02:32:13.649]  That notion has been suggested by the noted professor in that subject, Jonathan Turley, who will join us presently.
[02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:19.811]  Mr. Turley likens the Bush team, in fact, to the Sopranos at the end of his piece, Get Criminal and Get Made.
[02:32:19.831 --> 02:32:35.416]  He cites other administration officials whose criminal acts or potentially criminal behavior have posed no barrier to advancement, like Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, who as White House counsel may well have been the architect of the kinds of torture, at least the legal eases for the torture, that led to the Abu Ghraib abuses.
[02:32:36.016 --> 02:32:36.457]  I promise.
[02:32:36.477 --> 02:32:40.902]  We're joined now by the professor of constitutional law at George Washington University, Jonathan Turley.
[02:32:40.942 --> 02:32:42.024]  Thanks again for your time, sir.
[02:32:42.404 --> 02:32:42.804]  Thanks, Keith.
[02:32:43.125 --> 02:32:50.954]  Your joke about the Sopranos and the Chicago Tribune piece, timely, telling, it'll fire up everybody on both sides, but the argument beneath it is dead serious.
[02:32:51.074 --> 02:32:55.600]  From the point of view of the Constitution, the point of view of the law of the land, what are you seeing here?
[02:32:56.587 --> 02:32:58.908]  Well, you know, this is a pretty impressive rogues gallery.
[02:32:59.128 --> 02:33:13.351]  From his very first term, Bush shocked many people by reaching out to officials who had either been convicted or pleaded guilty to crimes during the Reagan and Bush administrations, and others who many felt should have been indicted.
[02:33:13.891 --> 02:33:18.852]  They included people like Elliott Abrams, who pleaded guilty to three crimes.
[02:33:18.872 --> 02:33:19.732]  They were misdemeanors.
[02:33:20.513 --> 02:33:23.693]  John Poindexter, who was convicted of three crimes.
[02:33:23.713 --> 02:33:26.094]  Those were thrown out on a mere technicality later.
[02:33:26.855 --> 02:33:31.661]  You had Otto Reich, who was accused of a domestic propaganda program.
[02:33:32.421 --> 02:33:44.697]  You have a very long list of people, and what emerged through the two terms was that people who seemed to be accused of violating the law had a rapid ascent in this administration.
[02:33:45.298 --> 02:33:57.096]  And one has to wonder whether this is suddenly a criteria that the president likes people who are willing to go to the edge of the law and beyond it to achieve what he believes is a worthy purpose.
[02:33:58.024 --> 02:34:12.770]  If it's personnel decisions, or if it's a president signing a statement relating to a law that basically says, I'm not going to obey this law if I don't feel like it, or if it's something larger, more aggressive, domestic surveillance, or any of these other things, where are the constitutional checks?
[02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:14.991]  Is that machinery still present?
[02:34:15.051 --> 02:34:15.852]  Is it still working?
[02:34:15.912 --> 02:34:17.872]  Is it rusted, or is it not working at all?
[02:34:17.892 --> 02:34:19.553]  Well, it's not working very well.
[02:34:19.713 --> 02:34:21.594]  Many federal judges have, in fact,
[02:34:22.354 --> 02:34:33.280]  I really brought the Bush administration up to the bar of the court, and they have in fact rejected many of the arguments, including the Supreme Court of the United States.
[02:34:33.981 --> 02:34:38.383]  But the real check and balance for this type of thing rests with Congress.
[02:34:38.923 --> 02:34:40.063]  And Congress has done nothing.
[02:34:40.083 --> 02:34:45.785]  Do you realize that Congress has not even held a substantive investigation of the NSA operation?
[02:34:46.145 --> 02:34:55.008]  An operation that most of us believe was criminal, that the federal law defines quite clearly as a federal crime.
[02:34:55.589 --> 02:35:07.197]  Now, instead of investigating that, the Congress actually gave the President a standing ovation during the State of the Union speech when he promised to continue to violate that law.
[02:35:07.357 --> 02:35:09.839]  He said he would continue this program.
[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:16.064]  And the people who were responsible for passing the law that he was violating gave him a standing ovation.
[02:35:16.084 --> 02:35:19.166]  It was the most bizarre thing I've ever seen in my life.
[02:35:19.784 --> 02:35:26.190]  But now we have the architect of that program who's been nominated to head the CIA.
[02:35:26.210 --> 02:35:31.935]  Now, that was not a natural choice because if you look at his record, it was actually fairly mixed.
[02:35:31.955 --> 02:35:33.196]  We're talking about General Hayden.
[02:35:33.476 --> 02:35:42.163]  General Hayden's accused of wasting as much as $2 billion when he was at the NSA on a program called Trailblazer.
[02:35:42.584 --> 02:35:44.265]  Almost $2 billion.
[02:35:44.926 --> 02:35:47.448]  Normally that would be an impediment to advancement.
[02:35:48.217 --> 02:35:50.959]  I'm surprised you didn't get Secretary of the Treasury.
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:36:00.065]  The wartime argument that always comes back in these kind of debates about presidential powers, what's the history on that in terms of the Constitution and the presidents?
[02:36:00.105 --> 02:36:09.732]  Have presidents who have been seen to have stretched the Constitution, have they been investigated in wartime, even under the much stricter definitions of wartime we used to have?
[02:36:10.678 --> 02:36:18.140]  Well, first of all, this president's theory of his power is now, I think, so extreme that it's unprecedented.
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:22.102]  He believes that he has the inherent authority to violate federal law.
[02:36:22.742 --> 02:36:25.223]  He has said that, not just in signing statements.
[02:36:25.263 --> 02:36:35.926]  In the infamous torture memo that Alberto Gonzalez signed, it was stated that he could, in some circumstances, order federal officials to violate federal law.
[02:36:36.659 --> 02:36:40.203]  And this is consistent across the board with this president.
[02:36:40.843 --> 02:36:48.210]  Frankly, I'm not too sure what he thought he was swearing to when he took the oath of office to uphold the Constitution and our laws.
[02:36:48.250 --> 02:36:52.735]  I've never seen a president who's so uncomfortable in his constitutional skin.
[02:36:53.796 --> 02:36:57.277]  All of this, Jonathan, has been likened to the swing of a pendulum.
[02:36:57.377 --> 02:37:08.260]  That this is Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, harkening back to their days as rookies in the Ford administration, watching the fallout of presidential powers being cut back after the abuses of Richard Nixon.
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:11.661]  If that's true, if it is a pendulum, does the pendulum swing back?
[02:37:11.861 --> 02:37:12.261]  Can it?
[02:37:12.381 --> 02:37:12.661]  Will it?
[02:37:13.496 --> 02:37:17.280]  Well, unfortunately, civil liberties don't swing back like other issues.
[02:37:18.461 --> 02:37:21.103]  Civil liberties is a very precious commodity.
[02:37:21.303 --> 02:37:26.788]  When you lose them, it tends to run out of your hand like sand, and it's hard to get it back.
[02:37:27.309 --> 02:37:33.614]  And that's one of the dangers here, that presidents, when they acquire power, rarely return it to the people.
[02:37:34.215 --> 02:37:36.016]  And so we have to be very concerned.
[02:37:36.076 --> 02:37:38.519]  This country is changing in a very significant way.
[02:37:39.219 --> 02:37:50.175]  And it's something that citizens have to think about because if there is a war on terror, and I believe that we must fight terror, obviously, but we're trying to defend that Constitution.
[02:37:50.716 --> 02:37:52.519]  And we're really at a point...
[02:37:53.629 --> 02:38:05.493]  So, I mean, it's a pretty fair piece, but then they say the war on terror is real, but that they're destroying the very country and the very heart of the nation that supposedly is under attack.
[02:38:05.973 --> 02:38:07.574]  No, the war on terror is a fraud.
[02:38:07.614 --> 02:38:15.397]  No, they carried out the attacks to do this domestically, and they openly have the NSA with the Border Patrol and others spying on the Minutemen.
[02:38:16.757 --> 02:38:22.579]  And the border is going to stay wide open, and the President hires PR firms with Vicente Fox to help break down the border.
[02:38:24.654 --> 02:38:29.915]  And I have USA Today here in front of me right now, and it's a big whitewash as usual.
[02:38:30.055 --> 02:38:33.156]  NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls.
[02:38:33.756 --> 02:38:46.919]  The National Security Agency has been secretly collecting the phone records of tens of millions of Americans using data provided by AT&T, Verizon, Bell South, people with direct knowledge of the agreement told USA Today News.
[02:38:47.583 --> 02:38:56.288]  The NSA program reaches into homes and businesses across the nation by amassing information about the calls of ordinary Americans, most of whom aren't suspected of any crime.
[02:38:56.728 --> 02:39:00.550]  This program does not involve the NSA listening to or recording conversations.
[02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:01.671]  That's not true.
[02:39:02.171 --> 02:39:08.914]  But the spy agency is using the data to analyze calling patterns in an effort to detect terrorist activity, sources said in a separate interview.
[02:39:09.315 --> 02:39:11.716]  So they're just coming out and conditioning you.
[02:39:12.196 --> 02:39:15.198]  It's the largest database ever assembled in the world, said one person,
[02:39:15.798 --> 02:39:17.219]  And it goes on here to say...
[02:39:33.988 --> 02:39:46.656]  That the three telecommunications companies are working under a contract, who pays them, by the way, with the NSA, which launched the program in 2001, shortly after the September 11th terrorist attacks.
[02:39:46.676 --> 02:39:50.478]  The source said the program is aimed at identifying and tracking suspected terrorists, they said.
[02:39:50.498 --> 02:39:52.139]  It goes on for seven pages.
[02:39:52.579 --> 02:39:54.040]  Let me just stop right there.
[02:39:55.041 --> 02:39:58.703]  I don't know how long most of you have been listening, but I've been on air coming up on 12 years.
[02:40:00.224 --> 02:40:00.824]  Well, that's not true.
[02:40:00.844 --> 02:40:02.105]  I've been on the air since 1995, so 11 years, 11 plus.
[02:40:05.465 --> 02:40:34.354]  And I remember in 1996, it was in telecommunications publications, let me just say this again, that they had, through a regulatory agreement, decided to take $6 billion, it ended up being $9 billion, it went over, $3 billion, to put NSA offices in every major telephone hub, satellite uplink, or everything, whether it's run over copper or fiber optic,
[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:35.801]  We're good to go.
[02:41:04.927 --> 02:41:05.927]  If you don't like it, fine.
[02:41:06.107 --> 02:41:07.468]  Just go to Russia, scumbags.
[02:41:07.808 --> 02:41:08.948]  You work for a bunch of criminals.
[02:41:09.829 --> 02:41:12.649]  But about 20% of it is anti-crime, anti-terror.
[02:41:12.689 --> 02:41:20.272]  And really, they use the NSA when the FBI or the CIA, and I've talked to the FBI and CIA agents on air, by the way, about this many times.
[02:41:21.112 --> 02:41:23.713]  As soon as they're about to bust terrorists or bust drug dealers...
[02:41:24.542 --> 02:41:25.923]  They get a phone call from their superior.
[02:41:26.203 --> 02:41:27.563]  Hey, I hear you're on this case.
[02:41:27.643 --> 02:41:28.524]  Well, I didn't file this.
[02:41:28.544 --> 02:41:29.104]  How do you know?
[02:41:29.404 --> 02:41:30.705]  We have our ways of knowing.
[02:41:30.745 --> 02:41:31.945]  You back off right now.
[02:41:32.386 --> 02:41:36.027]  I'm issuing you under a presidential directive an arrest warrant.
[02:41:36.528 --> 02:41:48.233]  You will be arrested and this warrant will be executed if you divulge any of this conversation or any of the operations and if you continue to pursue this operation because this is involving something you know nothing of, mister.
[02:41:50.293 --> 02:41:52.114]  And all these people have gone public about this.
[02:41:52.154 --> 02:42:07.064]  So, the NSA is used to make sure that terrorist operations launched by globalists, white slavery rings, drug dealing, trafficking in technology, trafficking in weapons, is not discovered.
[02:42:07.204 --> 02:42:20.133]  It is an early warning snooper system to ensure that the criminals can continue to operate, and they use it to spy on other crime syndicates that are not at their high level, that aren't paying their cut and are competing with them.
[02:42:20.513 --> 02:42:22.874]  I've got to write an article about this and break this down for people.
[02:42:23.294 --> 02:42:31.796]  So most of it's economic, the rest of it is targeting other crime rings that aren't paying their cut, or stopping good cops and good intelligence people from stopping their operations.
[02:42:33.237 --> 02:42:33.997]  It's that simple.
[02:42:35.077 --> 02:42:36.238]  We've got two Jon Stewart clips.
[02:42:36.258 --> 02:42:46.581]  I want to play the short one first, the one where he plays a clip of when he nominated Porter Goss a year and a half ago, and then the next one when he nominated General Hayden.
[02:42:47.081 --> 02:42:47.781]  Do you have that clip?
[02:42:49.787 --> 02:42:51.307]  Roll that first one.
[02:42:51.767 --> 02:42:53.428]  Bush nominated this morning.
[02:42:54.128 --> 02:42:57.248]  Mike Hayden is supremely qualified for this position.
[02:42:57.308 --> 02:43:01.609]  He's the right man to lead the CIA at this critical moment in our nation's history.
[02:43:01.969 --> 02:43:03.810]  The right man at the critical moment in our nation's history.
[02:43:03.850 --> 02:43:04.570]  That's reassuring.
[02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:05.810]  He's the right man.
[02:43:06.150 --> 02:43:06.750]  Critical moment.
[02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:07.750]  Wait a minute.
[02:43:07.930 --> 02:43:10.551]  What did Bush say when he appointed Goss two years ago?
[02:43:11.231 --> 02:43:17.252]  He's the right man to lead this important agency at this critical moment in our nation's history.
[02:43:20.134 --> 02:43:23.976]  That is the same clip, by the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:24.657 --> 02:43:28.219]  I mean, it's two separate clips, but it's the exact same thing he's saying.
[02:43:28.819 --> 02:43:33.622]  So you can go to prisonplanet.com and watch the actual video of Bush doing that.
[02:43:33.662 --> 02:43:36.224]  I wish I had the staff that The Daily Show has.
[02:43:36.244 --> 02:43:38.885]  We could do that for you, but they're doing a great job.
[02:43:39.166 --> 02:43:42.407]  Here's a little bit more comical piece on it from The Daily Show.
[02:43:42.428 --> 02:43:43.968]  Let's roll this one.
[02:43:44.028 --> 02:43:44.689]  Comedic gag.
[02:43:45.911 --> 02:43:48.272]  Obviously, any time Zarkali releases a tape, it's news.
[02:43:48.792 --> 02:43:51.253]  But sometimes, it just happens.
[02:43:51.893 --> 02:43:52.793]  How is that covered?
[02:43:52.873 --> 02:43:59.615]  For example, last week in Atlanta, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was giving a speech when he was suddenly interrupted.
[02:44:00.096 --> 02:44:05.898]  There was Screaming Lady, and then, of course, Screaming Fellow also joined in, and then Screaming Lady with War Crimes Matter.
[02:44:07.018 --> 02:44:12.900]  Typical, easily dismissed crackpots doing the same old... Wait, I'm sorry, sir.
[02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:13.500]  You had a question?
[02:44:14.213 --> 02:44:18.494]  I'm Ray McGovern, a 27-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:44:18.934 --> 02:44:25.637]  Why did you lie to get us into a war that was not necessary and that has caused these kinds of casualties?
[02:44:26.237 --> 02:44:26.877]  Ruh-roh.
[02:44:26.897 --> 02:44:29.638]  First of all, I haven't lied.
[02:44:30.658 --> 02:44:30.778]  Oh!
[02:44:31.238 --> 02:44:31.938]  He didn't lie!
[02:44:31.958 --> 02:44:34.039]  All right, well, that settles it, everybody.
[02:44:34.079 --> 02:44:35.019]  There's pound cake in the back.
[02:44:35.039 --> 02:44:36.140]  We're going to all have a nice time.
[02:44:36.220 --> 02:44:41.641]  It appears that there were not weapons of mass destruction there.
[02:44:42.102 --> 02:44:43.182]  You said you knew where they were.
[02:44:44.275 --> 02:44:44.776]  I did not.
[02:44:45.756 --> 02:44:46.017]  See?
[02:44:46.037 --> 02:44:50.540]  He never said he knew where they were.
[02:44:51.261 --> 02:44:52.142]  We know where they are.
[02:44:52.202 --> 02:45:06.354]  They're in the area around Tukrit and Baghdad and the UCS staff and they'll sit somewhere.
[02:45:06.394 --> 02:45:10.818]  Well, to be fair, Rumsfeld probably never saw that episode of Meet the Press.
[02:45:14.466 --> 02:45:20.196]  So the Secretary of Defense caught in a contradiction about weapons of mass destruction.
[02:45:21.377 --> 02:45:23.541]  Surely that will be a big story.
[02:45:24.671 --> 02:45:27.493]  How much of an axe do you have to grind with Secretary Rumsfeld?
[02:45:27.633 --> 02:45:29.174]  But he wasn't just any heckler.
[02:45:29.214 --> 02:45:29.935]  Were you nervous?
[02:45:30.275 --> 02:45:32.216]  Tucker, I resent the word heckler.
[02:45:32.437 --> 02:45:33.617]  I'd like you to take that back.
[02:45:33.798 --> 02:45:34.978]  Okay, I'm not taking it back.
[02:45:35.359 --> 02:45:40.402]  Rumsfeld encouraged whoever, I think, had their hands on you at the time to let you stay there.
[02:45:40.482 --> 02:45:41.903]  Does he get any credit for that today?
[02:45:41.923 --> 02:45:43.945]  Isn't it enough that he was wrong and had bad judgment?
[02:45:44.005 --> 02:45:45.046]  Why does he have to be a liar, too?
[02:45:45.606 --> 02:45:48.128]  Well, you know, that's the question you have to direct to him.
[02:45:48.988 --> 02:45:49.689]  But won't.
[02:45:51.798 --> 02:45:55.980]  To be fair, One News Network was able to question Rumsfeld personally.
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:57.500]  No holds barred.
[02:45:58.100 --> 02:46:01.782]  So when you hear people say, we won the war, but we lost the peace.
[02:46:02.202 --> 02:46:03.222]  Oh, that's nonsense.
[02:46:03.302 --> 02:46:06.784]  So it's your way or the highway is not true.
[02:46:07.204 --> 02:46:09.545]  It is so wrong, it's just unbelievable.
[02:46:10.645 --> 02:46:13.446]  Mmm, that's some good old-fashioned muck polishing.
[02:46:14.736 --> 02:46:21.808]  Yes, as Iraq continues to spiral out of control and criticism of Rumsfeld grows, Fox News decided it was time to take an in-depth look at the issue.
[02:46:27.276 --> 02:46:28.576]  Yes, why he fights.
[02:46:28.656 --> 02:46:34.258]  An hour-long, unvestigative report into the real Donald Rumsfeld, hosted by Necklace Johnson.
[02:46:34.838 --> 02:46:39.280]  He wears a pedometer on his belt to count every step he takes every day.
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:43.301]  But even for a former college wrestler who still did one-arm push-ups.
[02:46:43.481 --> 02:46:47.502]  People magazine that named him one of the year's sexiest men.
[02:46:51.727 --> 02:46:52.167]  Wow!
[02:46:52.327 --> 02:46:53.468]  One of the year's sexiest men!
[02:46:53.648 --> 02:46:57.069]  I believe, though, that was a pretty off year for sexy men.
[02:46:58.709 --> 02:47:01.150]  If I remember correctly, that was the year Tom Bosley won.
[02:47:01.170 --> 02:47:13.993]  Now, the special did include interviews with Rumsfeld critic General Paul Van Riper, one of the officers who had called for Rumsfeld's resignation.
[02:47:14.293 --> 02:47:16.674]  I'm sure there'll be no change in the reporter's inflection.
[02:47:17.429 --> 02:47:19.351]  What are you trying to accomplish by doing this?
[02:47:19.691 --> 02:47:25.356]  And you don't think this debate threatens the civilian leadership of the military?
[02:47:25.677 --> 02:47:28.119]  Does that hurt the war effort?
[02:47:31.001 --> 02:47:34.304]  I can't tell if I'm smelling the fairness or the balance.
[02:47:35.826 --> 02:47:39.929]  But ultimately, why he fights could only end with why.
[02:47:39.949 --> 02:47:43.833]  That is a piece of the airplane.
[02:47:45.828 --> 02:47:47.249]  He crashed into this building.
[02:47:47.549 --> 02:47:53.093]  It's a wonderful reminder to people who come in here of what happened.
[02:47:54.014 --> 02:47:54.454]  Wonderful?
[02:47:55.135 --> 02:47:58.837]  Couldn't have gone with stark or vivid or effective?
[02:48:00.839 --> 02:48:02.940]  It's almost like you're enjoying this.
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:03.961]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:04.551 --> 02:48:05.072]  All right, folks.
[02:48:18.616 --> 02:48:21.658]  Notice how they attack Ray McGovern all over national TV.
[02:48:21.698 --> 02:48:22.958]  How dare him!
[02:48:23.439 --> 02:48:25.039]  How dare him question!
[02:48:25.239 --> 02:48:28.121]  How dare him call Rumsfeld a liar!
[02:48:28.501 --> 02:48:29.982]  He's a liar!
[02:48:30.502 --> 02:48:32.283]  We've got him set up here very soon.
[02:48:32.303 --> 02:48:35.365]  You'll be hearing Ray McGovern on this broadcast, as you have many times.
[02:48:35.845 --> 02:48:37.225]  Final segment coming up.
[02:48:37.245 --> 02:48:37.766]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.149 --> 02:48:47.991]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:48.738 --> 02:48:50.019]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:50.219 --> 02:48:55.961]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.

[02:49:01.783 --> 02:49:05.944]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:49:06.104 --> 02:49:09.885]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:10.145 --> 02:49:14.727]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:14.867 --> 02:49:21.109]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.169 --> 02:49:23.029]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:51:45.892 --> 02:51:48.654]  Just think about how arrogant they are.
[02:51:49.154 --> 02:51:55.378]  They said hundreds of times apiece that they knew you had WMDs, and they get up on TV and say they never said it.
[02:51:55.838 --> 02:51:56.899]  Like we're stupid!
[02:51:57.719 --> 02:52:01.824]  They treat us like we're morons, and I'll tell you, most Americans aren't morons.
[02:52:01.844 --> 02:52:04.388]  They're just not focused in on politics, so they buy it.
[02:52:05.389 --> 02:52:09.274]  But I guess you've got to kind of be a moron to not care about the world, so I guess we are morons.
[02:52:09.890 --> 02:52:12.152]  I mean, it's just, it's really, really sad.
[02:52:12.212 --> 02:52:14.953]  I want to try to jam Anthony, Doug, Mike, and Osin.

[02:52:51.218 --> 02:52:52.039]  Make copies of them.
[02:52:52.059 --> 02:52:52.899]  Get them out to people.
[02:52:52.959 --> 02:52:53.480]  Don't wait.
[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:54.781]  It's having a big effect.
[02:52:54.821 --> 02:52:56.422]  Let's push this thing through for the big win.
[02:52:57.062 --> 02:52:58.664]  Anthony in New York, thanks for holding.
[02:52:58.684 --> 02:52:59.024]  Go ahead.
[02:52:59.691 --> 02:53:10.036]  Alex, I spent 33 years in the Marines, most of my time being in a high-class muscle man for big business, Wall Street, and the bankers.
[02:53:10.196 --> 02:53:13.117]  In short, I was a racketeer for capitalism.
[02:53:13.598 --> 02:53:15.579]  That's a direct quote from... Smedley Butler.
[02:53:15.979 --> 02:53:18.380]  Words of racket, Smedley Butler, you're right.
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:29.345]  And in 1932, he led a half a million veterans who camped out in Washington until they helped to alleviate some of the corruption of our government.
[02:53:30.242 --> 02:53:32.143]  In South America, what did the people do?
[02:53:32.203 --> 02:53:41.587]  They came down from the hills, and there was absolute total gridlock in the capital cities until there was a change in the government.
[02:53:42.028 --> 02:53:50.772]  If 1% of the American populace gridlocks Washington, D.C., 3 million people, I think we might get some change in Washington.
[02:53:52.040 --> 02:53:52.900]  Well, it's going to happen.
[02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:55.921]  That's why they've got riot police ready and are engineering this police state.
[02:53:55.941 --> 02:54:01.623]  They know they're going to do things so bad with the pension funds and the dollar and the rest of it that there's going to be a revolt.
[02:54:02.144 --> 02:54:03.464]  And they think they're going to get away with it.
[02:54:03.484 --> 02:54:03.924]  They're not.
[02:54:03.964 --> 02:54:05.005]  Good to hear from you, Anthony.
[02:54:05.045 --> 02:54:05.785]  Great points.
[02:54:06.045 --> 02:54:08.286]  Marine Corps General Smedley Butler said those words.
[02:54:08.766 --> 02:54:10.146]  Doug, Doug, you're on the air.
[02:54:10.166 --> 02:54:10.987]  Where are you calling us from?
[02:54:11.007 --> 02:54:13.308]  I'm calling from Niles, Michigan.
[02:54:13.468 --> 02:54:13.808]  Welcome.
[02:54:15.128 --> 02:54:19.990]  I just was reading on CNN.com this article about the records database.
[02:54:21.276 --> 02:54:24.057]  And I just wanted to make a quote from George Bush.
[02:54:24.417 --> 02:54:30.579]  What he said is that our efforts are focused on links to Al-Qaeda and their known affiliates.
[02:54:30.879 --> 02:54:35.961]  Bush said, the privacy of ordinary Americans is fiercely protected in all of our activities.
[02:54:36.021 --> 02:54:36.821]  And that's not true.
[02:54:36.981 --> 02:54:40.342]  Everything is being, who you're calling is being recorded.
[02:54:40.942 --> 02:54:41.503]  Exactly.
[02:54:41.683 --> 02:54:42.223]  Everyone's.
[02:54:42.363 --> 02:54:42.863]  Everyone's.
[02:54:43.283 --> 02:54:45.223]  It sounds just like East Germany.
[02:54:45.503 --> 02:54:46.964]  You know, the Stasi or whatever they call it.
[02:54:46.984 --> 02:54:51.825]  Well, sir, I mean, how long have you heard me say that they're recording everything and then people couldn't believe it?
[02:54:51.865 --> 02:54:52.405]  Here it is.
[02:54:54.065 --> 02:54:54.865]  They paid for it in 96.
[02:54:54.985 --> 02:54:59.946]  It became law October 1st, 2001, perfectly after they launched the attacks.
[02:55:00.226 --> 02:55:03.306]  It was set up six years before to become law 2001.
[02:55:04.447 --> 02:55:05.647]  Is that not premeditated?
[02:55:05.887 --> 02:55:06.467]  Premeditated?
[02:55:06.707 --> 02:55:07.927]  That's premeditated to me.
[02:55:08.987 --> 02:55:11.568]  You know, this is all coming to an end, man.
[02:55:11.588 --> 02:55:11.808]  I mean...
[02:55:12.338 --> 02:55:16.220]  We're all going to a New World Order, One World Government, man, it's happening.
[02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:24.665]  I've been telling people for years, been telling neighbors, people that I work with, all over the place, man, and it's... It's happening, God bless you.
[02:55:24.725 --> 02:55:25.326]  But you know what?
[02:55:25.366 --> 02:55:26.126]  Not without a fight.
[02:55:26.486 --> 02:55:28.908]  Yeah, he's openly becoming a dictator, and he's just a puppet.
[02:55:29.288 --> 02:55:31.649]  Mike in North Dakota, last caller, sorry to OSA.
[02:55:31.950 --> 02:55:32.630]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:55:33.551 --> 02:55:35.011]  Hey, I have a question.
[02:55:35.071 --> 02:55:38.834]  Speaking of the police state, have you ever been to GlobalSecurity.org?
[02:55:40.014 --> 02:55:40.915]  I believe I have.
[02:55:41.897 --> 02:55:47.018]  Yeah, basically, all their plans for martial law in America are all right there.
[02:55:49.498 --> 02:55:54.780]  I read that, you know, they even say that FEMA takes over and the FBI kind of oversees them.
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:55:58.700]  Yeah, the FBI is going to oversee the gun confiscation troops.
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:01.241]  We had that six years ago in mainstream news.
