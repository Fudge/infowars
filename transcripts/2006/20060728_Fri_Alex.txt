[00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:06.252]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:07.973]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:09.793]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:11.234]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:12.914]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:17.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:21.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:23.316]  Music
[00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:31.358]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:37.142]  We've got a big Friday broadcast lined up for you today, the 28th day of July, 2006.
[00:00:37.782 --> 00:00:41.825]  We're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:43.126]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.747]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:46.388]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:49.650]  on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:50.499 --> 00:01:02.164]  Don't forget, the Genesis Network not only supplies Internet streams of the entire network to the world, we now also stream my broadcast 24 hours a day.
[00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:13.669]  Not only the live broadcast, but refeeds 24 hours a day, the broadcast repeating continuously, so you can tune into any segment of the broadcast that you wish.
[00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.070]  And we're about to expand the podcasting as well for you.
[00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:22.802]  We have the producer, the director, Aaron Russo, joining us.
[00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:24.603]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:31.345]  I supported him in his run to be the presidential candidate for Libertarians, which he narrowly lost a few years ago.
[00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:35.587]  He's a good friend of mine, and I've had a chance to sit down and watch the film.
[00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:36.547]  It's an amazing film.
[00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:37.707]  We're good to go.
[00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:20.365]  Imagine a gun individual who found out that the IRS was basically a private organization and that there is no law making you pay the income tax, though they criminally enforce it.
[00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:29.211]  So look for him to be joining us during the interview with Aaron Russo, who produced quite a few big movies, some Eddie Murphy films.
[00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:32.373]  What's that film he produced?
[00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:36.436]  It's my favorite Eddie Murphy movie, but I can't place the name on it.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.400]  Right now.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.782]  Oh, Trading Places.
[00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:47.229]  Yes, where there's the two corrupt aristocratic bankers manipulating the stock market, and they try to set him up, and Dan Aykroyd's in it.
[00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.012]  Okay, you don't tune in to hear about Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy.
[00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:57.457]  The point is, he's made an anti-New World Order film that's incredible, and he will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:02:57.517 --> 00:02:57.937]  In 30 minutes...
[00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:00.726]  Or in 28 minutes, to be precise.
[00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:08.209]  We'll be joined by Wayne Madsen, former National Security Agency employee, who just continues to knock them out of the park with great reports.
[00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:28.159]  He caught the Israelis red-handed using some type of chemical weapons over in Israel, and now he, of course, has discovered that what we guessed a few days ago, he's confirmed that the United Nations forces there in that particular village had witnessed atrocities and civilians being targeted by design, purposefully.
[00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:35.409]  And so, ten separate times over several hours of being shelled and bombed, they kept begging the U.N.
[00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.932]  to stop targeting them, and finally the U.N.
[00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:49.339]  observers were killed when they were targeted by precision-guided missiles fired from Israeli aircraft.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.582]  So he'll be joining us for a short interview coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:03:56.733 --> 00:04:02.035]  In the meantime, yes, it's true, it's confirmed, it's on their schedule, posted yesterday afternoon.
[00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.976]  We have press releases up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:14.499]  Even if you don't have cable, but you do have internet, you'll be able to watch it streaming as they air it coming up Saturday night, 8 p.m.
[00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.120]  Eastern, and they're going to re-air it at 11 p.m.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.440]  Eastern.
[00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:19.698]  Eastern.
[00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.521]  That way folks on the West Coast can see it during prime time.
[00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:27.764]  C-SPAN 1 will air the 9-11 Neocon Symposium piece.
[00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:31.007]  They're billing it as an hour and 50 minutes.
[00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:34.249]  It's actually an hour and 48 minutes, but c'est la vie.
[00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.494]  I guess they, like C-SPAN's signature, they like to leave the camera rolling a few minutes after each event ends.
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.301]  That's my new show.
[00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:51.130]  The point is, that's coming up tomorrow night, 8 o'clock Eastern, 7 o'clock Central, 6 o'clock Mountain, 5 o'clock Pacific.
[00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:56.816]  So those press releases are up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:00.059]  Right now, we'll be right back with the latest news and information.
[00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.631]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:09.912]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.272 --> 00:05:17.936]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:25.660]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.002]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:05:29.342 --> 00:05:31.703]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:32.924]  NSA spies.
[00:05:33.613 --> 00:05:34.854]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:36.775]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:06:02.438 --> 00:06:02.778]  We're good to go.
[00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:26.798]  We're good to go.
[00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:54.007]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:55.167]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.823]  Go to royalpurple.com for details.
[00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:23.749]  That's Royal Purple, the high-performance motor oil that outperforms.
[00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:32.262]  Oil is oil.
[00:07:32.822 --> 00:07:33.863]  Don't kid yourself.
[00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:36.204]  Technology makes better oils possible.
[00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:37.165]  Like Royal Purple.
[00:07:37.345 --> 00:07:40.507]  Royal Purple reduces friction and increases film strength.
[00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:46.832]  Go to royalpurple.com and you'll find independent test results from North Carolina and Oklahoma State.
[00:07:47.012 --> 00:07:48.593]  Not hype, just facts.
[00:07:48.873 --> 00:07:49.633]  What's in it for you?
[00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:54.457]  Superior protection, fewer oil changes, more horsepower, torque, and better gas mileage.
[00:07:54.617 --> 00:08:00.200]  Find Royal Purple at Napa, O'Reilly's, your local high-performance center, and royalpurple.com.
[00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:00.801]  Today!
[00:08:05.806 --> 00:08:06.426]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:08.186]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.887 --> 00:08:10.027]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.647 --> 00:08:11.467]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:13.188]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.588 --> 00:08:17.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.091]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:30.994]  Several big guests lined up for you today on this live Friday edition, 28th day of...
[00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:32.401]  July 2006.
[00:08:32.542 --> 00:08:34.503]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:34.983 --> 00:08:44.910]  The websites are MarshallLaw911.info, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com.
[00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.351]  Why do we have so many websites?
[00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:50.434]  Well, really, our enemies have made us stronger.
[00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:52.955]  That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[00:08:53.296 --> 00:08:56.458]  I read several books written by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.
[00:08:57.276 --> 00:08:57.676]  We're good to go.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:47.670]  Not having a lot of money to have the really huge, fancy server banks of five, six servers together with all these huge firewalls and IT people watching at 24 hours a day, we went with the cheap man's version and simply had different websites with different servers, different parts of the country.
[00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.632]  So if one site was taken down, we still had a bunch of others that were up.
[00:09:52.512 --> 00:09:54.193]  And I'm continuing in that tradition.
[00:09:54.213 --> 00:10:01.596]  We're going to launch two or three more websites this year, and two or three more the next year, and two or three more the next year, and add webmasters to each one.
[00:10:02.217 --> 00:10:05.018]  And most of the sites have the same news on them every day.
[00:10:05.398 --> 00:10:11.541]  Mainstream, alternative, government documents, photos, video, music videos, the best stuff we find on the web.
[00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:13.137]  We're good to go.
[00:10:13.157 --> 00:10:13.318]  I think?
[00:10:33.462 --> 00:10:40.209]  And so over the years, we have just launched more and more sites, more and more servers, more and more websites to counter that.
[00:10:40.249 --> 00:10:45.354]  And what's happened is the sites now all have their own, oh, I guess, kind of...
[00:10:46.601 --> 00:10:47.341]  Okay, that out of the way.
[00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:37.736]  Well, you have Wayne Madison joining us in about 20 minutes, former NSA employee, to talk about evidence of Israel using chemical-slash-biological weapons in Israel and evidence that the UN observers who were killed four or five days ago, I guess three days ago, had actually witnessed a massacre or some war crimes, which we do know are going on on an hourly basis during this conflict that Israel and the neocons are escalating.
[00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:43.532]  So he'll be joining us coming up in about 20 minutes to cover that.
[00:11:43.612 --> 00:11:47.820]  And then in the next hour we have Aaron Russo, the Hollywood director and producer with his new film.
[00:11:48.826 --> 00:11:51.328]  One more program note, and then I will plunge into the news.
[00:12:16.992 --> 00:12:25.894]  C-SPAN to air historic 9-11 expose, 9-11 and the Neocon agenda panel discussion to run this Saturday, July 29th, at 8 p.m.
[00:12:26.314 --> 00:12:27.414]  Eastern Standard Time.
[00:12:27.454 --> 00:12:31.395]  And I've privately joked around the office that I'd eat my hat if they ended up airing it.
[00:12:31.675 --> 00:12:34.716]  They normally air these type of events within two weeks.
[00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:40.837]  This will be the unusual month after that they will be airing it.
[00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:44.218]  And I did talk to several of the bigwigs at C-SPAN.
[00:12:44.258 --> 00:12:46.578]  They go, yes, it's going to air, barring some big event.
[00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.771]  But it's not guaranteed, though it is on their schedule.
[00:12:53.192 --> 00:12:57.274]  And this is unlike any other 9-11 event that you've seen on C-SPAN.
[00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:01.956]  David Ray Griffin did a good job about a year ago with an hour-long presentation.
[00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:05.077]  There's been a truth convergence that's been on C-SPAN.
[00:13:05.097 --> 00:13:10.699]  There have been three or four events that I know of, and I've watched them all, and they've been okay.
[00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:12.822]  They've been all right.
[00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:14.784]  I mean, the information's been good.
[00:13:14.864 --> 00:13:17.785]  And Griffin came out and said he believes it's an inside job.
[00:13:18.405 --> 00:13:19.926]  Probably the most hardcore thing we've seen.
[00:13:20.407 --> 00:13:23.108]  Well, what you're going to witness tomorrow night at 8 p.m.
[00:13:23.188 --> 00:13:30.632]  Eastern, again, 7 o'clock Central, and then re-air at 11 o'clock Eastern for the West Coast, is unbelievable.
[00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:34.674]  It is a powerful hour and 50-minute long presentation.
[00:13:36.155 --> 00:13:37.556]  An hour and 30 minutes of the panel.
[00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:55.671]  With Jim Fetzer, founder, scholar of 9-11 Truth, Professor Stephen Jones, an intro introduction, Webster Griffin Tarpley, and of course myself, and Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of the Star Wars Project, all exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:13:56.292 --> 00:13:59.975]  And the whole thing is opened up by a 10-minute speech that I give.
[00:14:00.995 --> 00:14:07.140]  And in between the program they're putting on featuring our information Saturday at 8...
[00:14:08.004 --> 00:14:08.404]  We're good to go.
[00:14:32.373 --> 00:14:34.374]  His lordship may actually be watching.
[00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:38.515]  I'm sure I will move up the enemies list with this one.
[00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:43.777]  But you know the cliche, somebody has got to do it.
[00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.118]  And if you don't have cable, but you have internet...
[00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:53.952]  There will be a link, a live link for the program, so that you can watch it as it plays.
[00:14:54.652 --> 00:14:59.034]  As they air it, you'll be able to watch it in real time via the computer.
[00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:10.078]  We have links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in these two C-SPAN press releases, one that Ryan Slickheisen put out, one that Paul Watson put out, hence two different press releases.
[00:15:10.438 --> 00:15:12.419]  But in both of those, we have links to the C-SPAN program,
[00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:16.180]  Live internet feed, so you can check that out.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.941]  We'll see if we crash it for them.
[00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:18.982]  Though I doubt that.
[00:15:19.022 --> 00:15:20.502]  They have very large servers.
[00:15:21.523 --> 00:15:21.863]  Okay.
[00:15:22.563 --> 00:15:24.224]  That out of the way.
[00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:28.065]  Dead U.N.
[00:15:28.185 --> 00:15:31.107]  soldiers had atrocity info.
[00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:38.530]  Wayne Madsen, our intelligence sources report that an Israeli defense force attack on Lebanon is being carried out as a joint Israeli-U.S.
[00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.550]  military operation.
[00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:41.151]  Moreover, there are
[00:15:42.654 --> 00:15:43.275]  It continues.
[00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:44.216]  Joint Israeli and U.S.
[00:15:44.277 --> 00:15:47.641]  war rooms coordinating the U.S.-supported Israeli attacks on Lebanon.
[00:15:47.982 --> 00:15:58.017]  The ultimate aim of Washington and Jerusalem is not only to eliminate Hezbollah as a political force in Lebanon, which they've succeeded in doing the opposite, but also to remake Lebanon as an American and Israel client state.
[00:15:58.377 --> 00:16:04.820]  Israeli forces are pounding parts of Lebanon, especially in the north, where there are no hospital units and primarily Christian populations.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:10.763]  In addition, Israeli forces are being aided by Bush administration with high resolution overhead imagery of U.S.
[00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:17.326]  spy satellites and signals intelligence intercepts and national security agency assets, including signet satellites.
[00:16:19.507 --> 00:16:22.328]  And then he goes into the details of killing the U.N.
[00:16:22.368 --> 00:16:24.389]  observers because they were witnessing massacres.
[00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:26.890]  He'll be joining us again in 15 minutes to cover that.
[00:16:29.534 --> 00:16:31.635]  A really frightening article out of the New York Times.
[00:16:31.735 --> 00:16:35.716]  Tide of Arab Opinions Turns to Support for Hezbollah.
[00:16:36.536 --> 00:16:50.520]  And even allies like Saudi Arabia are saying they're in danger of being overthrown and saying Israel, who they've tried to support, is now endangering the whole region going into World War III and that they're, quote, arrogant and being aggressors and playing with fire.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:57.562]  And we have up on Infowars.com the Saudis' public warning
[00:16:58.348 --> 00:16:59.208]  Here's the Washington Post.
[00:17:27.662 --> 00:17:32.585]  Headline, Doctors Test Anti-Smoking Vaccine.
[00:17:34.287 --> 00:17:50.098]  And I read this article this morning and tried to figure out exactly what type of vaccine this is, if it's the one announced two years ago by the British that actually attacks the electrochemical neuron receptors in the brain.
[00:17:51.816 --> 00:17:59.340]  And they didn't say whether this was the same or similar vaccine, though I went and then checked out the Pfizer Inc.
[00:17:59.421 --> 00:18:06.385]  vaccine, and it appears to be the type of vaccine, the very same type being pushed in England.
[00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:09.386]  And what does it do?
[00:18:09.606 --> 00:18:11.427]  Well, this is not the Outer Limits.
[00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:12.848]  This is not the Twilight Zone.
[00:18:13.769 --> 00:18:14.849]  This is the real deal.
[00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.150]  What does it do?
[00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:18.652]  It attacks.
[00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:20.833]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:18:22.086 --> 00:18:28.207]  Every receptor in the brain that picks up endorphins.
[00:18:30.387 --> 00:18:41.649]  And when I finally saw on the website of C-SPAN.com yesterday that they had finally posted our 9-11 Neocon roundtable discussion, I got a rush of euphoria for a minute or two.
[00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:42.470]  I was very excited.
[00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.310]  We did high fives.
[00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.310]  That is called endorphin, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:49.531]  I don't need heroin.
[00:18:50.051 --> 00:18:51.111]  I don't need cocaine.
[00:18:52.904 --> 00:19:01.508]  When I see a beautiful vista, when I'm up in the mountains in the early morning and the sun rises, I get a rush of endorphin looking at God's creation.
[00:19:02.249 --> 00:19:07.651]  When I look at my beautiful wife, I get a rush of endorphin.
[00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:14.855]  I guess the one time they fumbled the ball, because I was a lineman and then a linebacker when I played a few years of football.
[00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:20.858]  The one time I got the ball and ran a touchdown when it fumbled, I had a huge rush of endorphin.
[00:19:22.777 --> 00:19:28.240]  You get a huge rush of endorphin when a big guy's pounding on you that started the fight with you and you hit him and he goes down.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.480]  Knocked out.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.581]  You get a rush of endorphin.
[00:19:30.621 --> 00:19:32.322]  Your brain's saying, good job.
[00:19:32.822 --> 00:19:34.643]  You protected yourself.
[00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:39.645]  No more with this.
[00:19:39.665 --> 00:19:49.410]  I spent 45 minutes looking into this article this morning and it's the exact same vaccine we heard about two years ago and I'll cover this when we get back.
[00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.051]  They're going to force this on you.
[00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:57.042]  Actual brain-damaging, brain-destroying vaccines.
[00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.564]  They're not joking.
[00:19:58.584 --> 00:19:59.104]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:06.711]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:07.532]  have diabetes.
[00:20:07.812 --> 00:20:14.837]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increases the risk for heart disease.
[00:20:14.917 --> 00:20:19.440]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.482]  Finding out who or your loved one has diabetes can be scary.

[00:21:01.768 --> 00:21:05.769]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.989 --> 00:21:18.273]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.673 --> 00:21:19.093]  The U.S.
[00:21:19.133 --> 00:21:24.715]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:25.115 --> 00:21:27.316]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:29.176 --> 00:21:29.656]  We're good to go.
[00:21:50.004 --> 00:21:50.205]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[00:22:02.034 --> 00:22:02.714]  Hello, folks.

[00:23:01.528 --> 00:23:06.809]  Dry, cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:23:07.069 --> 00:23:09.669]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:12.650]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:17.991]  It's diabetic-friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:23:18.231 --> 00:23:21.751]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:23:22.072 --> 00:23:23.632]  Now they look and feel great.
[00:23:23.992 --> 00:23:27.452]  If you have calluses or dry, cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:30.673]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:34.611]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:23:35.092 --> 00:23:36.993]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:23:37.713 --> 00:23:40.875]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:23:41.535 --> 00:23:47.839]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:23:48.619 --> 00:23:50.820]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:51.441]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:51.461 --> 00:23:51.921]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:14.171 --> 00:24:19.613]  So the average person in the United States got up this morning from the Washington Post there in the D.C.
[00:24:19.693 --> 00:24:23.614]  area or online and went, Oh, doctor's test anti-smoking vaccine.
[00:24:23.634 --> 00:24:24.434]  Well, that sounds good.
[00:24:24.474 --> 00:24:27.055]  Maybe I'll give that to my 14-year-old son.
[00:24:27.095 --> 00:24:28.316]  I don't want him to start smoking.
[00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:30.057]  I think I've smelled it on him.
[00:24:30.117 --> 00:24:31.017]  He may be starting.
[00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.851]  The Alex Jones Show!
[00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:33.591]  We're good to go.
[00:24:53.018 --> 00:24:53.898]  We're good to go.
[00:24:53.978 --> 00:24:55.038]  We're good to go.
[00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:30.867]  Multiple types of receptors and, quote, creates plaques where the body then has an autoimmune response.
[00:25:30.967 --> 00:25:37.832]  So it kills large areas of key receptor sites in the brain.
[00:25:39.112 --> 00:25:41.774]  The treatment keeps nicotine from reaching the brain.
[00:25:41.814 --> 00:25:42.955]  This is back to the article.
[00:25:43.335 --> 00:25:47.058]  Making smoking less pleasurable and theoretically easier to give up.
[00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:51.101]  The small amount that still manages to get in helps to ease withdrawal.
[00:25:51.461 --> 00:25:52.422]  The main reason most...
[00:25:53.248 --> 00:25:54.369]  Quitters relapse.
[00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:15.885]  If it works, and this has not been proven yet, the vaccine could become part of a new generation of smoking treatments that attack dependency in the brain instead of just replacing the nicotine from cigarettes in a less harmful way, like the gum, lozenges, patches, and nasal sprays sold today.
[00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:20.809]  Yeah, I've seen a bunch of big studies showing that actually low levels of nicotine without the
[00:26:21.883 --> 00:26:26.346]  Carbon monoxide and dioxide and the toxins and the tar is actually good for you.
[00:26:27.047 --> 00:26:32.150]  One such drug, Pfizer-Inc's Chantix, is due on the market any day now.
[00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:42.937]  Another, Sanfoe Aventis Essays Aconflia, recently won approval in Europe as a weight loss drug.
[00:26:43.037 --> 00:26:44.819]  In the U.S., regulators follow suit.
[00:26:45.159 --> 00:26:51.183]  Some doctors say they also will use it to help smokers quit, especially those concerned about gaining weight.
[00:26:52.293 --> 00:26:52.993]  And it goes on.
[00:26:54.354 --> 00:26:56.034]  Now, it's being billed in England.
[00:26:56.074 --> 00:26:58.335]  And two years ago, I first saw this in the Times of London.
[00:26:58.355 --> 00:26:59.615]  We made a big deal about it on air.
[00:26:59.655 --> 00:27:02.256]  Had guests on, scientists on covering it, if you remember.
[00:27:03.936 --> 00:27:10.858]  And they said that it will be used to stop heroin, cocaine, and other narcotics abuse, and, quote, nicotine.
[00:27:11.855 --> 00:27:41.493]  Because these receptors are all centered in the same areas and are very similar, and that the viruses then migrate to that area, though the viruses themselves have been damaged or killed, depending on which analysis you read of these different families of vaccines, but the body has an autoimmune response in the area, again creating protein plaques, like the prions, or the prions, just like Alzheimer's.
[00:27:42.276 --> 00:27:42.897]  We're good to go.
[00:27:42.937 --> 00:27:43.558]  We're good to go.
[00:27:57.674 --> 00:27:58.194]  We're good to go.
[00:27:58.234 --> 00:27:58.614]  We're good to go.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.745]  That this vitamin pill will make you guaranteed live 100 years longer.
[00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:27.967]  I'm like, no, I'm not going to.
[00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:28.867]  But don't you want $10,000?
[00:28:29.368 --> 00:28:30.369]  No, I don't.
[00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:35.073]  When I hang up the phone, they call back four or five times in a month trying to sell me on it.
[00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:38.656]  Literally, when I hang up the phone and tell them no, I feel good.
[00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:47.736]  Because doing good, doing the right thing, not being corrupt, and the opposite, that's what your conscience is.
[00:28:48.076 --> 00:28:59.346]  When you do something bad that's against the human species, that's against our basic operating system that God gave us, when you do something bad against the tribe, you then feel bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:59.767 --> 00:29:01.308]  See, I feel good today.
[00:29:02.097 --> 00:29:05.458]  I'm addicted to trying to do good, and I'm still a bad person.
[00:29:05.478 --> 00:29:08.419]  I still do bad things, and I feel bad when I do bad things.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.480]  Evil people call that weakness.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.141]  They love their hard black hearts.
[00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:16.703]  Now, I love my big, red, beating heart full of hot blood.
[00:29:17.323 --> 00:29:19.484]  I'm hot-blooded, and I like it.
[00:29:19.504 --> 00:29:25.346]  Okay, so getting a death threat and not having fear and going through it and dealing with it.
[00:29:26.152 --> 00:29:27.273]  I get an adrenaline rush.
[00:29:27.753 --> 00:29:32.735]  Being attacked by enemies, being attacked by the New York Times and Popular Mechanics and Vanity Fair.
[00:29:33.036 --> 00:29:36.097]  I get an adrenaline rush because I know I'm hurting them.
[00:29:36.397 --> 00:29:39.379]  And I'm going to go on hurting them because they've been hurting the weak.
[00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:44.682]  But you won't be able to feel like that if they give you this special injection.
[00:29:44.702 --> 00:29:47.563]  Of course, then they'll have drugs later to treat your depression.
[00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:52.526]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.986 --> 00:29:54.487]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.496 --> 00:29:58.277]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.397 --> 00:30:03.578]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual?

[00:30:38.723 --> 00:30:40.005]  We got immediate results.
[00:30:40.501 --> 00:30:42.624]  Do you need an instruction manual for your kid?

[00:32:00.757 --> 00:32:07.540]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.981]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[00:32:11.301 --> 00:32:15.223]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing our rights.

[00:33:06.224 --> 00:33:08.145]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.605 --> 00:33:11.427]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.729 --> 00:33:29.678]  In just a moment, we'll be talking with Wayne Madison, former NSA analyst, employee, who just knocks it out of the park over and over again with on-target analysis and inside information that we've vetted and proven to be accurate time and time again, so we're always honored to have him concerning.
[00:33:30.387 --> 00:33:34.310]  Munitions that carry chemical or biological weapons clearly being loaded by Israelis.
[00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.951]  That's now been confirmed.
[00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:37.351]  And then the even bigger report here.
[00:33:38.192 --> 00:33:39.593]  We know they're also using DU now.
[00:33:39.993 --> 00:33:42.595]  That's been confirmed by Dr. Doug Rocky and others.
[00:33:43.796 --> 00:33:44.856]  But even bigger news here.
[00:33:45.136 --> 00:33:51.680]  Knowingly killing evidence shows the UN observers who were there in that village witnessing ongoing massacres.
[00:33:51.721 --> 00:33:55.603]  Which Israel has a history of targeting UN installations to get rid of witnesses.
[00:33:55.943 --> 00:33:57.664]  That's coming up here in just about a minute and a half.
[00:33:57.724 --> 00:33:58.725]  Before I go any further...
[00:34:00.228 --> 00:34:01.269]  We're good to go.
[00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:02.710]  We're good to go.
[00:34:28.914 --> 00:34:29.895]  We're good to go.
[00:34:29.915 --> 00:34:30.156]  I think?
[00:34:47.288 --> 00:34:48.028]  That will be there.
[00:34:48.128 --> 00:34:55.491]  And then we're going to have two hours of Shanghai Five, just a great lounge act that even plays the big hotels in Vegas.
[00:34:56.492 --> 00:34:58.553]  And they're great patriots, anti-New World Order.
[00:34:59.633 --> 00:35:00.914]  Even got some political songs.
[00:35:01.034 --> 00:35:02.754]  They'll play from midnight to 2 a.m.
[00:35:03.155 --> 00:35:07.296]  So from 7 to 2, come for the whole thing or come for part of it, only $10.50.
[00:35:07.797 --> 00:35:11.798]  Okay, $10.50 for your ticket.
[00:35:12.278 --> 00:35:14.619]  And you can get those via Infowars.com.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:15.920]  And, folks...
[00:35:16.812 --> 00:35:21.961]  We're getting up to about 15% of the tickets already being gone a day and a half into selling them.
[00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:24.045]  And this event is, what, 28 days, 29 days away.
[00:35:26.465 --> 00:35:28.045]  So if you want tickets, you better get them.
[00:35:28.065 --> 00:35:33.486]  If you don't have a computer, get your neighbor, get your son, get your daughter, get somebody at work to get you the tickets.
[00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:36.047]  They can print off the e-tickets right when you purchase them.
[00:35:36.727 --> 00:35:37.787]  Then you'll be emailed the ticket.
[00:35:37.807 --> 00:35:40.248]  You can print it off right there and get your ticket.
[00:35:40.748 --> 00:35:45.329]  I keep meaning to tell my staff to tell the 1-800 line to set it up where you can get tickets that way.
[00:35:45.389 --> 00:35:49.410]  But you can only do that for a few weeks because if we mail you tickets, we've got to have time to get them to you.
[00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.710]  If not, we'll have your name and we'll let you in at the door there.
[00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.450]  But we'll definitely implement that too.
[00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.811]  But right now you can only get tickets via Infowars.com.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:06.703]  And then coming up in September on the 4th, 5th, and 6th, and then on the 13th and 14th, five events.
[00:36:07.663 --> 00:36:11.264]  It's on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the next week on a Wednesday and a Thursday.
[00:36:11.764 --> 00:36:14.965]  We're going to be showing Terror Storm at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:36:16.289 --> 00:36:16.790]  We're good to go.
[00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:38.083]  Please go to InfoWars.com, the secure online video and bookstore, and get my new film, Terror Storm.

[00:36:38.484 --> 00:36:39.204]  Make copies.
[00:36:39.724 --> 00:36:47.851]  The power of you, the listeners, getting these films, making copies aggressively, getting them out to people, can expose the globalists that carried out 9-11.
[00:36:48.611 --> 00:36:50.012]  And while you're at it, get Marshall Law.
[00:36:50.032 --> 00:36:50.673]  Get Road to Terror.

[00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:35.251]  My weekly TV reports, almost all of the 20-hour symposium, I think it's like 16 hours is up there now, the last few hours we put up by this weekend, or by Monday.
[00:37:36.512 --> 00:37:41.035]  The roundtable discussion you're about to see on C-SPAN, shot from R4 cameras, not just C-SPAN's 2.
[00:37:41.495 --> 00:37:42.616]  I mean, that's up there for members.

[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.981]  All right, going back to Wayne Madsen.
[00:37:51.221 --> 00:37:53.282]  Wayne, thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[00:37:53.643 --> 00:37:54.603]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[00:37:54.983 --> 00:37:55.424]  You bet.
[00:37:57.085 --> 00:38:03.466]  First off, just for those who don't know who you are, even though you're a routine guest here on the broadcast, and an honored contributor, we're very thankful to have you with us.
[00:38:03.706 --> 00:38:07.847]  Tell us quickly about your website, tell us about your background, and then get into the intel you have.
[00:38:08.187 --> 00:38:17.689]  First on the munitions that carry chemical or bio weapons, photographed in Israel, now DU munitions photographed in mainstream reports of more weapons by the U.S.
[00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:19.029]  being shipped in of DU nature.
[00:38:19.529 --> 00:38:21.950]  And then also, please get into the new report you just broke,
[00:38:22.928 --> 00:38:37.881]  That's at Wayne Madsen Report right now concerning what many of us said two days ago that it looks like Israel would kill these individuals who for hours were begging for them not to continue targeting them to basically get rid of people that witnessed a massacre.
[00:38:38.601 --> 00:38:38.781]  Right.
[00:38:38.821 --> 00:38:44.166]  Well, my website, waynemadsenreport.com, basically what I'm trying to do is recreate something that's lost here
[00:38:45.259 --> 00:38:47.060]  Not only in Washington, but around the country.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.801]  There used to be the Washington Marigold Round.
[00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:56.604]  Very successful column on inside information put out first by Drew Pearson, taken over by the late Jack Anderson.
[00:38:57.765 --> 00:38:59.005]  And we've really lost that.
[00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:11.951]  When I talk to people here, I think it's my duty to get it out to the rest of the country because not everybody can afford to be here in Washington or even would want to live in this awful place.
[00:39:11.991 --> 00:39:12.131]  But
[00:39:12.891 --> 00:39:18.579]  But anyway, but yes, I have the two articles you mentioned.
[00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:21.163]  One on the Israeli use of chemical weapons.
[00:39:21.463 --> 00:39:27.391]  There was a photograph taken of an Israeli soldier using an artillery shell.
[00:39:27.512 --> 00:39:28.213]  I talked to two.
[00:39:29.587 --> 00:39:30.469]  Former U.S.
[00:39:30.549 --> 00:39:43.910]  military intelligence agents who served in Iraq who were looking for Iraqi WMDs and they said the container on the artillery shell is a pressurized container
[00:39:44.446 --> 00:39:50.307]  And can be used to carry any sort of chemical substance.
[00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:55.088]  Well, I did some checking with my shelf on some of the weapons encyclopedias online.
[00:39:55.388 --> 00:39:58.528]  In fact, we even know the very name of that particular munition.
[00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:05.190]  Am I correct in saying it can carry a chemical, but also any type of gas dispersal to aerosolize a biological as well?
[00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:06.610]  Absolutely.
[00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:12.891]  Now, the Israelis market it as an anti-landmine device, which contains a fuel...
[00:40:13.231 --> 00:40:17.853]  Yeah, there are towns, even in mainstream reports, where everyone's vomiting and puking and diarrheaing their guts out.
[00:40:38.881 --> 00:40:39.461]  That's right.
[00:40:39.781 --> 00:40:43.062]  And, you know, that's pretty fast acting for depleted uranium.
[00:40:43.122 --> 00:40:53.644]  The radioactivity of depleted uranium, that'll show up a little bit later as it is now in Iraq and among the Iraqis and also amongst our troops that are coming back.
[00:40:54.324 --> 00:41:05.827]  But the fact that Israel was using banned weapons, including white phosphorus, which can also be contained in those types of shells, is an indication that the Israeli government has really gone off of the
[00:41:06.249 --> 00:41:10.391]  Openly with precision munitions fired from helicopters and dropped from planes and missiles fired from aircraft blowing up.
[00:41:22.757 --> 00:41:23.737]  Well, that's right.
[00:41:23.778 --> 00:41:35.222]  These so-called precision guided munitions are about as precision guided as the ones we've been using in Iraq that have killed countless civilians, including women and children.
[00:41:51.614 --> 00:41:53.356]  Red Cross vans have been hit.
[00:41:53.637 --> 00:42:09.595]  And in the case of the attack on the UN outpost in Qiyam on the southern border of Lebanon, those people, including the guys that wound up getting killed, the four blue helmets,
[00:42:10.171 --> 00:42:15.256]  We're radioing Israel saying you're getting close, you're going to wind up killing somebody.
[00:42:15.296 --> 00:42:31.652]  The Irish liaison officer to the IDF said that he personally interceded with the Israelis and he said just like they've always done in the past, they ignored the UN about this brinkmanship and now we have four dead Israelis
[00:42:32.715 --> 00:42:49.369]  Well, the report is that for hours, ten separate calls, they were shelling the installation, the bunker, and then I guess Israel said, okay, we'll stop, we'll end this by firing a missile through the opening and killing all of you.
[00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:50.931]  That's right, and you know, U.N.
[00:42:50.971 --> 00:42:53.873]  Secretary General Anand said that it was deliberate.
[00:42:53.913 --> 00:42:58.097]  Of course, the U.S., John Bolton, this moron we have up there, this maniac,
[00:42:58.556 --> 00:43:07.999]  As our ambassador, who's going to probably get confirmed permanently as our ambassador, said that he wanted an apology from Kofi Annan for that.
[00:43:08.059 --> 00:43:18.562]  Now, I talked to people at the United Nations, and they confirmed to me that Annan based that on evidence that the United Nations has, that that was a deliberate attack on that UN outpost.
[00:43:19.002 --> 00:43:24.544]  And really, instead of demanding apologies from Kofi Annan, what should be happening is there ought to be a move
[00:43:24.932 --> 00:43:25.352]  Well, it's amazing.
[00:43:25.412 --> 00:43:27.173]  And, of course, the UN, they're not pure little...
[00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:40.491]  Well, you know, I talked several years ago to some of the guys that survived the USS Liberty attack during the Six-Day War in 1967.
[00:43:40.531 --> 00:43:45.494]  Of course, Israel not only attacked this NSA ship that was monitoring Israeli communications during the war,
[00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.010]  We're good to go.
[00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:25.578]  And in that case, of course, the NSA ship, the Liberty, which was flying the U.S.
[00:44:25.678 --> 00:44:32.542]  flag, had information about Israeli war crimes against Egyptian POWs in the Sinai.
[00:44:32.962 --> 00:44:33.182]  Yeah.
[00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:46.288]  Now, going back, Wayne Madison, about three weeks ago, when all this was kicking off over there, Israeli generals, Air Force and the ground force leader, both said, hey, we need 30,000 more troops to fully invade Sinai.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.582]  We're good to go.
[00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:05.877]  Moving forward, but they're still massing troops, massing armored vehicles and aircraft, and then calling in their national reserves.
[00:45:05.897 --> 00:45:11.342]  Do you think this is Israel simply taking a breather while they build up forces?
[00:45:12.203 --> 00:45:23.092]  Or do you think this signals that Israel may be listening to international pressure, especially some of their allies, Jordan now calling them an out-of-control aggressor, along with Saudi Arabia?
[00:45:23.132 --> 00:45:24.934]  What do you see happening in the next two weeks?
[00:45:25.454 --> 00:45:27.815]  I see it as a combination of things right now.
[00:45:28.195 --> 00:45:38.580]  There was a very recent report within the last hour or so that Israel, through the International Red Cross, is now negotiating on a prisoner swap with Hezbollah.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.542]  If that's the case, we're going to see this start to wind down.
[00:45:41.902 --> 00:45:45.163]  I also think Israel got its nose bloodied when it went into Lebanon.
[00:45:46.224 --> 00:45:47.605]  There's censorship in Israel.
[00:45:47.645 --> 00:45:50.466]  We don't know the number of casualties they're suffering.
[00:45:50.966 --> 00:45:52.527]  But one thing we know is that Israeli...
[00:45:53.286 --> 00:46:12.957]  Retired Israeli military officers and intelligence officials, just like over here with General Shinseki and General Zinni, they warned Olmert against this kind of adventure in Lebanon because they said in 1992, when Yitzhak Rabin was presented with a plan to occupy Lebanon to get rid of Hezbollah,
[00:46:14.064 --> 00:46:26.452]  Then Chief of Staff of the Israeli Defense Force Ehud Barak and this head of military intelligence, General Segei, they both prevailed on Rabin not to do it.
[00:46:26.472 --> 00:46:32.696]  He agreed with that and that the policy since then was to negotiate with Hezbollah on prisoner swaps.
[00:46:33.097 --> 00:46:43.003]  This, of course, as I reported, this whole thing was premeditated during a meeting last month in Beaver Creek, Colorado at the American Enterprise Institute Conference
[00:46:43.443 --> 00:46:55.746]  And a meeting between Cheney, former Israeli Prime Minister Likud, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Knesset member, Russian refugee Netanyahu.
[00:46:55.786 --> 00:46:59.006]  And that was before they sent the soldiers over the border to get captured.
[00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:02.667]  So what do you think is the real reason for pulling this?
[00:47:02.687 --> 00:47:06.048]  Just a political smokescreen off of Bush and Cheney's?
[00:47:06.608 --> 00:47:09.292]  It's probably a lot of those, but especially the last one you mentioned.
[00:47:09.333 --> 00:47:12.998]  My friend James Bamford has an article out in Rolling Stone.
[00:47:22.632 --> 00:47:25.035]  It's called Iran, The Next War.
[00:47:25.055 --> 00:47:30.120]  This is Lebanon, then Syria, and then Iran.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.202]  That's what these guys intend to do.
[00:47:32.222 --> 00:47:35.646]  It won't be an October surprise.
[00:47:35.726 --> 00:47:38.469]  It's going to be like this surprise started in July and it'll
[00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:45.636]  So this is just a way to hype and draw the battle lines.
[00:47:46.056 --> 00:47:48.859]  We know Western governments are staging terror attacks throughout history.
[00:47:48.879 --> 00:47:51.962]  A lot of those are declassified, Wayne Madison, as you know well.
[00:47:53.703 --> 00:47:58.107]  We see the neocons hyping that Hezbollah is sure to nuke an American city soon, Fox News.
[00:47:58.408 --> 00:47:59.649]  We see the Israelis saying...
[00:48:00.009 --> 00:48:01.429]  We've got to go into Iran and Syria.
[00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:02.209]  They're behind it.
[00:48:02.469 --> 00:48:11.371]  We've seen the hype by Israel claiming that the kidnapped soldiers were taken to Iran, similar to the propaganda three months ago that they make Jews wear yellow stars or yellow signs.
[00:48:11.811 --> 00:48:12.551]  Total lies.
[00:48:14.071 --> 00:48:20.893]  Do you think the neocons were doing a trial balloon here, or do you think this is just an opening salvo and they still intend hell or high water to go in?
[00:48:20.933 --> 00:48:21.533]  That's number one.
[00:48:21.573 --> 00:48:29.234]  Number two, do you think some Western intelligence agency or sub-criminal group may stage a terror attack in the West and blame it on the Iranians or the Syrians?
[00:48:29.534 --> 00:48:45.458]  Well, I think this is phase two of the Clean Break, which was drawn up in 1996 for Netanyahu by all these crazy neocons like Doug Feith and Wolfowitz and Richard Perle and David Wormser, all these characters that are infiltrated in this Bush administration now.
[00:48:46.198 --> 00:48:47.878]  They presented this.
[00:48:47.938 --> 00:48:58.921]  What the Clean Break was prepared to do was to scrap all past Middle East peace processes, including Oslo, Oslo II, but also Camp David, going back to what Jimmy Carter...
[00:48:59.281 --> 00:48:59.862]  We're good to go.
[00:49:23.139 --> 00:49:24.060]  He has no authority.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.341]  What about Western governments staging terror attacks?
[00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:31.144]  They've set the stage saying, quote, we're going to get hit by Hezbollah in England or the U.S.
[00:49:31.524 --> 00:49:32.665]  They've set the table for that.
[00:49:32.725 --> 00:49:38.788]  Is that just psych warfare hyping, or do you think a Western crime element could carry out some type of attack?
[00:49:38.848 --> 00:49:40.149]  Oh, I think you're right on that.
[00:49:40.209 --> 00:49:45.832]  I think the London mass transit bombings, we now know that they had no links to al-Qaeda.
[00:49:47.092 --> 00:49:48.793]  And that's still fishy.
[00:49:48.813 --> 00:49:57.016]  This roundup of these guys in Canada, right after this neocon Stephen Harper takes over, that was very suspicious.
[00:49:57.036 --> 00:49:57.436]  Miami?
[00:49:58.116 --> 00:49:58.636]  Miami.
[00:49:59.376 --> 00:50:09.080]  Trying to say these Haitians that are probably, the only god they worship is probably the Rastafarian god, and they're hoping to get some ganja, some marijuana dropped from heaven.
[00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.601]  To try to link them to Al-Qaeda, I think is absolutely insane.
[00:50:13.261 --> 00:50:17.865]  But, of course, you know, the Bush people and the neocons think that we're all dumb out here.
[00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:23.329]  Do you think we're in danger of an element inside our government or another government staging a terror attack in the West?
[00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:25.511]  I think it's a real possibility.
[00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:27.050]  I do.
[00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:35.653]  And I think when you see the hype from Fox News and all this type of thing, I think they're trying to set the stage for something.
[00:50:36.413 --> 00:50:40.955]  We'll probably start hearing about chemical and bioweapons pretty soon now.
[00:50:41.435 --> 00:50:43.915]  Wayne Madsen, one more quick five-minute segment with you on the other side.
[00:50:43.935 --> 00:50:44.936]  I want to get into DU.
[00:50:45.496 --> 00:50:48.357]  We know that big bunker busters will just ship to Israel for Iran.
[00:50:48.937 --> 00:50:56.843]  And they've also been shipping in some of the Abrams Shabo rounds, and we've got photos of Israeli soldiers loading these into their artillery.
[00:50:56.863 --> 00:50:59.946]  I want to get your take on DU use in Lebanon right now.
[00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:01.107]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.689 --> 00:51:10.154]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.514 --> 00:51:18.120]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.837 --> 00:51:25.881]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.281 --> 00:51:37.768]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:41.550]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:43.912]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.252 --> 00:51:48.094]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:22.455 --> 00:54:23.716]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:24.596 --> 00:54:25.776]  We're talking with Wayne Madsen.
[00:54:27.557 --> 00:54:30.858]  Wayne Madsen, thank you for joining us and spending time with us today again.
[00:54:31.199 --> 00:54:32.599]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[00:54:33.399 --> 00:54:41.923]  DU, they've used the equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs in Iraq alone, in Afghanistan, proving grounds all over the U.S., all over Western Europe, all over England.
[00:54:42.663 --> 00:54:44.644]  Now Israel's been buying these weapons.
[00:54:44.684 --> 00:54:46.785]  They're now even using them down into small arms.
[00:54:48.348 --> 00:54:53.771]  Do the Israeli people, do you think, know that their earth is literally being salted for four and a half billion years?
[00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:54.972]  That's just one half-life?
[00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:56.413]  Give us your intel on that.
[00:54:57.073 --> 00:54:57.973]  Well, yes.
[00:54:58.013 --> 00:55:05.798]  You know, I mean, these deep penetrators, you know, we're going to see the effects of that in places like Iraq long after we're gone.
[00:55:06.198 --> 00:55:10.380]  But, you know, the people who say Israel is after the water in the Latani River in Lebanon...
[00:55:11.256 --> 00:55:24.140]  With them using depleted uranium, I find that argument to be a little bit strange because why would Israel want to be bringing down water that's already radioactive?
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:32.282]  When you look at the neocons in the Israeli government and you look at the neocons in our government, I think these people are basically not thinking.
[00:55:32.915 --> 00:55:33.918]  They're insane.
[00:55:34.299 --> 00:55:40.756]  I'm not saying they're all end-timers or anything like that, but they certainly don't think about the aftermath of what they're doing.
[00:55:42.819 --> 00:55:52.382]  Well, I myself am a Christian, but I don't want to be associated with the people that are saying, praise God, they're pushing microchips, praise God, they're about to blow the planet up, that means God will come back.
[00:55:52.922 --> 00:55:57.844]  I mean, we're supposed to stand up against evil, not embrace it and say that it's wonderful.
[00:55:57.864 --> 00:56:03.666]  And I think the neocons love some of the misguided end-timers who are cheerleading us all the way to Armageddon.
[00:56:04.186 --> 00:56:05.507]  Oh, that's what I think.
[00:56:05.587 --> 00:56:06.467]  I mean, I think that...
[00:56:06.807 --> 00:56:14.993]  The most amazing thing in Bob Woodward's book about Bush was when he asked Bush how he thought he'd be treated in history, and Bush's answer was bizarre.
[00:56:15.874 --> 00:56:17.655]  He says, we're all going to be dead.
[00:56:18.656 --> 00:56:19.577]  What is that?
[00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:27.943]  From an American president, that kind of response, we would have never heard that from any other past president about their legacy in history.
[00:56:28.314 --> 00:56:33.375]  It seems to me like he was saying, I don't care because the end times are near.
[00:56:33.615 --> 00:56:35.156]  Well, this guy's mentally ill.
[00:56:35.176 --> 00:56:44.538]  He needs to be removed from office, at least impeached, or they need to invoke the 25th Amendment because this guy's not only a danger.
[00:56:44.558 --> 00:56:48.759]  I mean, I don't care what he does to himself, but he can't take the rest of the world with him.
[00:56:49.597 --> 00:56:56.259]  Well, I mean, to get into mental illness, being a member of Skull and Bones and being involved in all those weird rituals, I mean, that's a cult of death.
[00:56:56.339 --> 00:56:57.499]  They are into death.
[00:56:57.979 --> 00:57:03.021]  I mean, the mindset in Washington, is anybody concerned that... I mean, here's an example.
[00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:12.784]  You probably saw the article last year where they admitted that they dumped 3 million plus gallons of solid nerve gas off the coast of North Carolina, millions of gallons of watered-down nerve gas in the Delaware River.
[00:57:13.124 --> 00:57:17.425]  I mean, what's going on with the elites that they're doing things that hurt themselves?
[00:57:17.998 --> 00:57:25.023]  Well, you know, there's one thought that these people, you know, they think that the planet's too overpopulated.
[00:57:25.043 --> 00:57:33.209]  They'd like to, you know, lop off about 5 billion so they could, you know, have a more manageable population.
[00:57:33.269 --> 00:57:34.670]  Well, I think that's at the heart of it, yes.
[00:57:34.871 --> 00:57:38.653]  Yeah, I mean, when you look at what they're doing, they seem to revel in death.
[00:57:38.954 --> 00:57:44.358]  These awful pictures of these burnt babies and young girls in Lebanon.
[00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:47.340]  That's another thing, and we're almost out of time, but I want to get your take on this.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:53.668]  In the past, I saw presidents, national security advisors, always solemn when they were at war councils or at meetings.
[00:57:54.128 --> 00:57:56.791]  Rice is in Israel and Lebanon like she just won the lottery.
[00:57:56.831 --> 00:58:01.437]  They're all giggling, crystals on TV, smacking and giggling.
[00:58:01.637 --> 00:58:02.418]  What's wrong with them?
[00:58:02.619 --> 00:58:05.722]  Right, I mean, you look at Bush and he's like a giggling psychopath.
[00:58:06.434 --> 00:58:08.515]  I mean, the guy, you know, what's wrong with them?
[00:58:08.535 --> 00:58:09.235]  I think they're nuts.
[00:58:09.455 --> 00:58:11.635]  I mean, I don't have any other word.
[00:58:11.655 --> 00:58:17.957]  I'm not a psychiatrist, but these people belong in mental institutions, certainly not in the White House, Pentagon.
[00:58:18.497 --> 00:58:23.418]  You know, that guy Rumsfeld is another one who's just a crazy lunatic.
[00:58:23.518 --> 00:58:25.059]  LePearl, I think, takes the cake.
[00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:28.580]  Oh, yeah, LePearl and Wolfowitz.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.460]  I don't know why Wolfowitz was even at the Rome Summit.
[00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:33.341]  You know, he's a World Bank president.
[00:58:33.974 --> 00:58:34.374]  All right.
[00:58:34.455 --> 00:58:36.196]  Well, Wayne Madsen, thank you for joining us.
[00:58:36.696 --> 00:58:37.417]  Good to be with you.
[00:58:37.637 --> 00:58:38.298]  Have a good weekend.
[00:58:38.318 --> 00:58:39.819]  We'll be right back with Aaron Russo.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:45.924]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.964 --> 00:58:46.384]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.544 --> 00:58:47.165]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.325 --> 00:58:50.748]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:51.608 --> 00:58:56.032]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:04.940]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.564]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.784 --> 00:59:13.908]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:20.253]  Well, it opens in select cities today, including Austin, Texas.
[00:59:21.194 --> 00:59:24.317]  And I'll be there, honored to introduce it, and have a Q&A afterwards.
[00:59:24.337 --> 00:59:28.781]  It's Aaron Russo's America, Freedom to Fascism.
[00:59:29.742 --> 00:59:31.103]  And he joins us for this full hour.
[00:59:31.869 --> 00:59:41.217]  Riding shotgun with us coming up at the bottom of the hour in 30 minutes will be Joe Bannister, the armed treasury agent who discovered that the whole IRS system was a fraud.
[00:59:41.597 --> 00:59:44.540]  He'll be with us coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:54.068]  Aaron Russo, of course, has done things like bringing Led Zeppelin to the United States and being the head of their promotions and tours.
[00:59:54.148 --> 00:59:58.912]  He's brought forward huge smash hits with Eddie Murphy like Trading Places.
[00:59:59.924 --> 01:00:04.246]  And he joins us now to talk about his new film, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:10.488]  And this is bittersweet for me, because I now remember a couple calls from Aaron, and they fell through the cracks.
[01:00:10.908 --> 01:00:14.309]  Somehow I didn't get in touch with him and wasn't in the film.
[01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:16.290]  I was like, man, why didn't you put me in this, Aaron?
[01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:17.571]  He goes, well, I tried, remember?
[01:00:18.071 --> 01:00:21.412]  But there's a lot of great people in it, and I think it's probably better for not having me in it.
[01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:22.192]  But it's excellent.
[01:00:22.613 --> 01:00:23.653]  I've had a chance to watch it.
[01:00:23.693 --> 01:00:27.254]  I've got a DVD of it he sent me, and it's going to be showing tonight here in Austin.
[01:00:27.654 --> 01:00:29.155]  Aaron Russo, good to have you on with us.
[01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.177]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[01:00:30.237 --> 01:00:31.580]  I'm really happy to join you today.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.202]  I really am.
[01:00:32.222 --> 01:00:39.017]  It's an important day for me and the movie and the country, and to be on your show today is perfect.
[01:00:39.733 --> 01:00:41.194]  I'm looking at some of the movie posters.
[01:00:41.294 --> 01:00:42.674]  Would you put a chip in this?
[01:00:42.754 --> 01:00:44.835]  It's an up-close shot of a little baby.
[01:00:44.855 --> 01:00:52.477]  It's another shot poster with the Statue of Liberty with a red filter over it with barbed wire fence up in front of it saying, No Trespassing.
[01:00:52.977 --> 01:01:03.741]  And, of course, the main theatrical poster is a big black poster with Aaron Russo's America, Freedom to Fascism with barbed wire across the poster.
[01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:08.264]  Word America in red, white, and blue makes Fahrenheit 9-11 look like Bambi.
[01:01:08.644 --> 01:01:14.768]  Four stars, highest rating, the scariest movie film you'll see all year after watching this film.
[01:01:14.808 --> 01:01:20.572]  Your comfy, secure notions about America and about what it means to be an American will forever be shattered.
[01:01:20.772 --> 01:01:22.974]  Todd Davis, Schwartz, CBS.
[01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:28.998]  Aaron, break down the movie for us, but before you do that, tell us how you got the idea to make this film.
[01:01:30.188 --> 01:01:38.453]  Well, the idea came from the fact that for years I've been hearing about the fact there's no law that makes people file a 1040 and pay an income tax.
[01:01:39.193 --> 01:01:51.061]  And I've heard this, and I philosophically never believed that there should be an income tax on your labor, that you own your own body and you own your labor, and when you give your labor to somebody, it's an exchange.
[01:01:51.421 --> 01:01:55.824]  It's something that you own, and the other person is giving you something they own, and it's an exchange.
[01:01:55.864 --> 01:01:56.664]  It's not taxable.
[01:01:56.904 --> 01:01:58.145]  That was always my philosophy.
[01:01:58.886 --> 01:02:02.207]  I decided to find out whether it was really a law or not and do an investigation.
[01:02:03.288 --> 01:02:23.356]  And as I investigated it, it became very clear to me that there is no law because in 1913, when they supposedly passed the 16th Amendment, although we all know it wasn't ratified, assuming it was ratified for the moment, the Supreme Court said on eight different occasions,
[01:02:23.812 --> 01:02:29.035]  That the 16th Amendment gave the government no new taxing power, and they couldn't tax your labor.
[01:02:29.836 --> 01:02:33.078]  And as soon as the Supreme Court said that, I mean, the case closed.
[01:02:33.138 --> 01:02:33.598]  It's over.
[01:02:34.178 --> 01:02:39.361]  You know, and so I don't even care about the code, because the code is irrelevant.
[01:02:40.182 --> 01:02:48.287]  And I went to see the former IRS commissioner, Sheldon Cohen, and the IRS set up that interview for me.
[01:02:49.225 --> 01:02:56.431]  And speaking with him, he said the 16th Amendment is the authority that allows the IRS to tax you.
[01:02:57.252 --> 01:03:00.495]  I said, well, what about all the Supreme Court decisions that say that didn't give you that power?
[01:03:02.557 --> 01:03:11.665]  And to my amazement, he said to the camera, and it's in the film, he said Supreme Court decisions are inapplicable to the IRS.
[01:03:13.779 --> 01:03:16.560]  So they're even above the Supreme Court.
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.520]  They're above the law.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.240]  That's what they're saying.
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.340]  The law doesn't matter to them.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.061]  And we all know that's not true.
[01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:38.824]  And so that's why in the Irwin Schiff case they have in the movie, you see the judge saying to Irwin Schiff as he's trying to express to the jury that there is no law, you see the judge say, and here's a direct quote, I will not allow the law in my courtroom.
[01:03:40.278 --> 01:03:40.759]  Stay there.
[01:03:40.979 --> 01:03:41.580]  Stay there, Henry.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.722]  So we're going to go through this.
[01:03:42.922 --> 01:03:46.306]  Amazing quotes and some of the things that are in the film after this quick break.
[01:03:47.087 --> 01:03:49.431]  And it'll be showing here tonight to a packed house.
[01:03:50.011 --> 01:03:51.453]  I think you may still be able to get tickets.
[01:03:51.473 --> 01:03:51.734]  We'll see.
[01:03:56.369 --> 01:03:59.551]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.892 --> 01:04:01.793]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.193 --> 01:04:09.859]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.539 --> 01:04:17.604]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.004 --> 01:04:20.946]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:04:21.266 --> 01:04:23.648]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:24.889]  NSA spies.

[01:04:53.743 --> 01:04:56.744]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:57.104 --> 01:05:05.907]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:06.227 --> 01:05:10.909]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:11.389 --> 01:05:18.111]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:18.491 --> 01:05:30.255]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.755 --> 01:05:35.217]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:35.397 --> 01:05:37.718]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:37.738 --> 01:05:39.699]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:39.719 --> 01:05:40.919]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.440]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.520]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.881 --> 01:05:59.043]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:05:59.283 --> 01:06:01.063]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:06:01.323 --> 01:06:07.666]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:06:07.966 --> 01:06:14.128]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.368 --> 01:06:21.871]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:06:22.231 --> 01:06:22.491]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[01:06:54.446 --> 01:07:00.448]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:04.110]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.554 --> 01:07:15.374]  Aaron Russo's
[01:07:17.817 --> 01:07:24.198]  New film opens today in select theaters across the United States, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:07:25.218 --> 01:07:27.059]  Aaron, I'm out of the gates here.
[01:07:27.099 --> 01:07:32.039]  Tell folks what cities this film is opening in and how they can get tickets, how they can see it.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:40.301]  The film opens up in New York, Chicago, Austin, Texas, Tampa, Florida, and Kansas City, Kansas.
[01:07:41.461 --> 01:07:42.761]  In those five cities tonight.
[01:07:43.821 --> 01:07:47.402]  And you get tickets by calling local box office
[01:07:48.027 --> 01:07:58.274]  On my website, freedom2fascism.com, there's a list of all the theaters and phone numbers to call, movie phone, you know, all the normal ways of buying a movie ticket.
[01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:13.745]  And it's really very important that people in those cities or even neighboring cities and states go to the theater this weekend and see the movie because if we have big box office this weekend, then the movie will spread across America.
[01:08:14.435 --> 01:08:14.955]  That's right.
[01:08:15.035 --> 01:08:23.900]  If you have a big box office, then it will probably expand next week to 200 theaters if it does well there, 800 theaters if it does well there, 1,500 theaters.
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:24.661]  Exactly.
[01:08:24.781 --> 01:08:25.701]  And then it's a mega hit.
[01:08:25.721 --> 01:08:28.883]  For those that don't know, that's how a platform release works.
[01:08:28.903 --> 01:08:31.645]  That's what Scanner Darkly, the film I'm in, just did.
[01:08:32.465 --> 01:08:33.265]  Right, exactly.
[01:08:33.546 --> 01:08:38.848]  And if you don't do that, if people don't show up to see the movie, it's going to die on the limb.
[01:08:38.868 --> 01:08:40.009]  The vine, as they say.
[01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:41.490]  It's very important.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.064]  That people show up this evening, that we get big box office, and the media sees what's happening.
[01:08:47.084 --> 01:08:50.487]  Because right now, they're trying very hard to keep me off the media.
[01:08:50.927 --> 01:08:51.968]  You know, they really are.
[01:08:52.469 --> 01:08:55.731]  I was supposed to do a big radio show this morning, between 10 and 11.
[01:08:55.771 --> 01:09:01.957]  And then they called up and said, listen, we have to push it back until 10.30, going to 11.
[01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:05.700]  And I got the producer on the phone, and he admitted that...
[01:09:07.714 --> 01:09:13.212]  The owner of the station got a call from somebody and said to pull my plug, not to let me on the show this morning.
[01:09:13.766 --> 01:09:15.807]  Well, I mean, it's happened over 30 times.
[01:09:15.847 --> 01:09:18.287]  I just had a huge offer for a national TV show.
[01:09:18.307 --> 01:09:22.328]  Head producers, head people in programming, and I always just wait.
[01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:26.929]  And then they go, oh, the president said, no, you don't get the TV show.
[01:09:27.249 --> 01:09:28.190]  We know it'd be huge.
[01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.570]  We know it'd be massive.
[01:09:30.090 --> 01:09:31.570]  And I just said, I told you so.
[01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:34.871]  And they're like, yeah, they say it's too politically incorrect.
[01:09:34.951 --> 01:09:35.811]  It's too powerful.
[01:09:36.112 --> 01:09:37.632]  And they say, we know it'd be a success.
[01:09:38.312 --> 01:09:39.132]  You know, that's the thing.
[01:09:39.192 --> 01:09:43.934]  This film that you've made would, you know, reach tens of millions of people.
[01:09:43.974 --> 01:09:45.534]  It could be in thousands of theaters.
[01:09:45.914 --> 01:09:48.355]  And it should be, but they'll do whatever they can to suppress it.
[01:09:48.655 --> 01:09:50.595]  So it's important for everybody to get out there to see it.
[01:09:51.016 --> 01:09:51.776]  Yeah, it really is.
[01:09:51.836 --> 01:09:52.956]  And I understand what you're saying.
[01:09:52.976 --> 01:09:55.937]  I mean, you know, CNBC wanted me on one day.
[01:09:55.957 --> 01:09:58.998]  They called me, begged me to come on one of the shows, Donny Deutch Show.
[01:09:59.658 --> 01:10:02.939]  They were doing a show about music and politics, movies and politics.
[01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:05.640]  And they said, we'll fly you in first class.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.560]  We'll do all the stuff.
[01:10:07.361 --> 01:10:09.141]  And I said, okay, I'll do it.
[01:10:09.181 --> 01:10:12.242]  They called back the next day and said, we can't have you on.
[01:10:12.282 --> 01:10:12.802]  We're sorry.
[01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:16.843]  Well, it's gotten to where when Fox producers call up and they go, hey, we're fans.
[01:10:16.883 --> 01:10:17.984]  Hey, I saw your documentary.
[01:10:18.364 --> 01:10:21.324]  Listen, we're going to fly you here or we're going to have you on tonight.
[01:10:21.344 --> 01:10:25.405]  And they call back and go, oh, the head guy just called down and said you're not allowed to come on.
[01:10:25.425 --> 01:10:27.226]  The same thing with CNN.
[01:10:27.246 --> 01:10:28.326]  I was told directly.
[01:10:28.986 --> 01:10:35.029]  That, you know, after being on, what, five nights in a row with the Charlie Sheen information, they were getting huge ratings.
[01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:39.452]  Instead of having 5,000 people in their online votes, they were having 50-plus thousand.
[01:10:39.472 --> 01:10:40.472]  They were getting top ratings.
[01:10:40.813 --> 01:10:43.534]  They were going to go a whole other week with it, and they got a call and said, kill it.
[01:10:43.954 --> 01:10:44.434]  Yeah, of course.
[01:10:44.454 --> 01:10:45.475]  I mean, that's it.
[01:10:45.495 --> 01:10:47.876]  You know, people like yourself, myself, we're not allowed on.
[01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:49.217]  You know, they want to keep us off.
[01:10:49.557 --> 01:10:56.341]  That's why it's so important for people who are listening to the show today that they go to the theater, they see the movie.
[01:10:57.123 --> 01:11:02.265]  We create a real sense of, you know, people want this movie.
[01:11:02.965 --> 01:11:07.426]  And then I assure you, because the movie theaters, I must say, have been very helpful so far.
[01:11:07.906 --> 01:11:09.127]  They have not been resistant.
[01:11:09.727 --> 01:11:13.568]  Even the AMC chain is playing the movie.
[01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.649]  Well, you've had some big hits in the past.
[01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:17.389]  Tell us about some of the stuff you've been involved in.
[01:11:17.869 --> 01:11:22.611]  Well, Trading Places with Eddie Murphy and Danny Aykroyd was a huge hit for me, a really huge hit.
[01:11:23.251 --> 01:11:25.972]  And The Rose with Bette Midler was a very, very big hit for me.
[01:11:26.801 --> 01:11:30.443]  And actually both of those are considered classics in the movie industry.
[01:11:30.523 --> 01:11:33.424]  One a classic comedy and the other a musical.
[01:11:33.444 --> 01:11:37.305]  And I'm sort of hoping that this one becomes a classic documentary.
[01:11:38.426 --> 01:11:41.487]  But I also brought Led Zeppelin to America for the first time.
[01:11:41.507 --> 01:11:46.129]  The movie Teaches with Nick Nolte and Morgan Freeman was a very big hit.
[01:11:46.589 --> 01:11:48.030]  I've done a lot of stuff.
[01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:51.111]  I've won an Emmy on television, a Tony on Broadway.
[01:11:52.045 --> 01:11:55.087]  You know, I've got seven Golden Globe nominations.
[01:11:55.168 --> 01:11:56.609]  My films have won three or four of them.
[01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:57.670]  I don't remember exactly.
[01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.771]  You know, I've done a lot of stuff.
[01:11:59.811 --> 01:12:03.134]  I've been very rewarded and awarded.
[01:12:03.915 --> 01:12:05.696]  And everything is very good.
[01:12:05.736 --> 01:12:08.759]  This movie is the most important movie I've ever done in my life.
[01:12:08.819 --> 01:12:10.520]  It's the one I'm most passionate about.
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:14.943]  Because America really is, we're deep in the trenches.
[01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:17.866]  I believe totally in the New World Order.
[01:12:18.539 --> 01:12:22.340]  I believe that globalism and the Federal Reserve have to be stopped.
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:23.761]  We have to stop world government.
[01:12:24.521 --> 01:12:26.842]  And it's a must, otherwise it's over for us.
[01:12:27.602 --> 01:12:30.723]  And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to stop it.
[01:12:31.223 --> 01:12:33.744]  And that's why I spent the last two years making this movie.
[01:12:34.044 --> 01:12:37.365]  So I was making the movie about the IRS, you know,
[01:12:38.132 --> 01:12:40.212]  Yeah, start back over.
[01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:44.493]  Start back over where we left off in the last segment with that judge's quote.
[01:12:44.533 --> 01:12:51.535]  And let's go through some more of the quotes and people we see and things we'll hear and witness for ourselves in Aaron Russo's America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:55.495]  Well, the judge said, I will not allow the law in my courtroom, Erwin Schiff.
[01:12:55.615 --> 01:13:03.637]  And then he said, but Erwin replies with, but the Supreme Court said in the cheek decision, you know, basically saying that you have to take Supreme Court decisions.
[01:13:04.369 --> 01:13:05.870]  And he said, irrelevant, denied.
[01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:07.372]  I don't care about the Supreme Court decisions.
[01:13:07.452 --> 01:13:08.473]  Irrelevant, denied.
[01:13:09.914 --> 01:13:13.097]  And they put everyone away for 13 years for not breaking any laws.
[01:13:13.897 --> 01:13:17.280]  And we're living in a police state.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.181]  That's really what it is.
[01:13:18.421 --> 01:13:21.524]  And I hate to say that because I do love my country.
[01:13:21.924 --> 01:13:23.846]  But I am very scared of my government.
[01:13:23.906 --> 01:13:24.466]  I really am.
[01:13:24.486 --> 01:13:25.847]  I don't like what's happening here.
[01:13:26.548 --> 01:13:29.811]  And I find it necessary to oppose it.
[01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:33.953]  You know, and to support the idea of freedom of the individual.
[01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:35.754]  We've become a country of institutions.
[01:13:36.534 --> 01:13:39.617]  And so when it comes to the income tax, you have three important things.
[01:13:39.657 --> 01:13:42.959]  You have the fact that the 16th Amendment was never ratified.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:51.665]  You have the fact that the Supreme Court said even if it was ratified, that didn't give the government any taxing powers, so they can't tax your labor.
[01:13:52.046 --> 01:13:57.029]  And then you have the third thing, which is there's no statute written by Congress that allows a tax on your labor.
[01:13:57.049 --> 01:13:57.730]  It doesn't exist.
[01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:59.411]  And the IRS code...
[01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:05.253]  It's very confusing in the first place, but it has to come from a statute from Congress.
[01:14:05.553 --> 01:14:06.714]  They can't write law.
[01:14:07.215 --> 01:14:08.816]  The IRS does not write law.
[01:14:09.496 --> 01:14:12.739]  And there has to be a statute by Congress that allows them to tax the labor.
[01:14:13.239 --> 01:14:14.240]  And there is no statute.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:19.444]  And those three things make it fairly clear that there is no law requiring you to pay an income tax.
[01:14:19.964 --> 01:14:21.145]  It's very obvious.
[01:14:21.806 --> 01:14:28.711]  But what's really interesting to me is that a lot of the newspaper reviews, we're getting a lot of good reviews and a lot of bad reviews,
[01:14:29.161 --> 01:14:30.542]  You know, it's amazing how controlled
[01:14:52.355 --> 01:14:53.876]  We really are, by the press.
[01:14:53.936 --> 01:14:55.136]  It's unbelievable to me.
[01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:57.337]  Oh, I run into this all the time.
[01:14:57.457 --> 01:15:01.239]  They're going to decide what's best for us to hear, and they won't debate you on the facts.
[01:15:01.279 --> 01:15:05.841]  I'll be on the phone with newspaper reporters, big magazine reporters, and I'll go, Listen, I got the facts.
[01:15:05.861 --> 01:15:06.521]  I want to give them to you.
[01:15:06.541 --> 01:15:07.581]  No, I don't need to see that.
[01:15:07.641 --> 01:15:11.883]  I know you're a kook, and I'm going to expose you.
[01:15:11.943 --> 01:15:12.203]  Right.
[01:15:12.824 --> 01:15:13.484]  Hell with the facts.
[01:15:13.504 --> 01:15:14.384]  What do we need the facts for?
[01:15:14.404 --> 01:15:17.445]  We're going to tell you what it is.
[01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:20.827]  I mean, they can't accept the facts, because then they lose.
[01:15:21.539 --> 01:15:25.402]  No, they have to be able to spin things the way they want to.
[01:15:25.963 --> 01:15:27.384]  And what they do, they do by force.
[01:15:27.424 --> 01:15:28.785]  The IRS acts by force.
[01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:30.207]  The media acts by force.
[01:15:30.487 --> 01:15:31.828]  But they won't let you on the air.
[01:15:31.848 --> 01:15:33.209]  Everything in this country...
[01:15:35.481 --> 01:15:37.682]  Has become perverted and twisted upside down.
[01:15:58.352 --> 01:16:04.114]  And they really see the big picture, they're pro-Second Amendment, even quote top liberals you've all heard about, folks.
[01:16:04.134 --> 01:16:10.276]  They've really woken up in the last four or five years, but they know that if they stick their heads up, they'll be lopped off.
[01:16:10.336 --> 01:16:11.317]  Take Charlie Sheen.
[01:16:11.717 --> 01:16:20.140]  He knew what was going to happen to him going public on this broadcast and then being told to shut up, but still going on Jimmy Kimmel Live and really paying for it, being drugged through the mud.
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:21.321]  We're good to go.
[01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:44.882]  Not after this.
[01:16:44.902 --> 01:16:45.382]  Not after this.
[01:17:08.883 --> 01:17:09.884]  No, I mean, that's my point.
[01:17:10.104 --> 01:17:10.584]  I could have.
[01:17:10.964 --> 01:17:11.844]  Not after this one.
[01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:18.307]  That's my point, is that you've had all these hit movies, and you could still be out there doing that, but you're following your passion.
[01:17:18.788 --> 01:17:24.350]  Well, what good is it to make those hit movies if you don't believe in it, and you believe the country's going down the tube?
[01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:25.291]  What's the point?
[01:17:25.611 --> 01:17:26.311]  There is no point.
[01:17:26.331 --> 01:17:27.612]  You know, we've got a free America.
[01:17:27.652 --> 01:17:30.193]  That's the most important thing on my agenda.
[01:17:30.635 --> 01:17:32.556]  And it should be the most important thing on everybody's agenda.
[01:17:32.616 --> 01:17:38.260]  Everybody has to stop fighting with each other over little things and get together and shut down the Federal Reserve System.
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.582]  Because that's how you're going to bring freedom back to this country.
[01:17:40.642 --> 01:17:42.763]  That's really the heart of the beast, isn't it?
[01:17:42.923 --> 01:17:45.325]  Is the central banking cartel.
[01:17:45.525 --> 01:17:51.769]  Well, the central banking cartel, first of all, is right out of the Communist Manifesto, as is the graduated income tax.
[01:17:52.169 --> 01:17:55.892]  But the point is that the Federal Reserve System
[01:17:56.613 --> 01:18:00.616]  It is the tool that the people behind it use to get their way.
[01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:04.819]  Once you have the ability to create money out of thin air, you can buy whatever you want.
[01:18:04.839 --> 01:18:06.440]  You can buy what politicians you want.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.801]  You can buy anything you want.
[01:18:07.861 --> 01:18:09.002]  And they own our government.
[01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:17.548]  And all these central banks across the world are all working together, and they all own their governments, and they're deciding what's going to happen to the people of this area.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.462]  And that's what has to stop.
[01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:21.843]  Here's a quote from the film.
[01:18:21.983 --> 01:18:27.787]  It's secret, and we can't find out what's happening, but the Congress created it, and it's not authorized in the Constitution.
[01:18:28.167 --> 01:18:32.150]  Congressman Ron Paul, in answer to Russo's question about who owns the Federal Reserve.
[01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:33.211]  I mean, think about it.
[01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:34.371]  A Hollywood movie, folks.
[01:18:35.212 --> 01:18:37.153]  In theaters with Ron Paul in it.
[01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.494]  You can't ask for any better.
[01:18:39.095 --> 01:18:45.079]  And I tell you, this is a who's who of patriots and people standing up for this nation in this new film.
[01:18:46.005 --> 01:18:47.566]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:18:47.586 --> 01:18:50.447]  Aaron Russo, the director, the producer, is our guest.
[01:18:50.527 --> 01:18:51.788]  Stay with us.
[01:18:55.150 --> 01:18:57.451]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:01.313]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:02.834 --> 01:19:12.439]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:13.414 --> 01:19:17.177]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:59.536]  The Bill of Rights is a term for the first ten amendments of the Constitution, limiting the federal government's power and preserving the rights of the people.
[01:21:59.996 --> 01:22:02.977]  Each day, we gradually lose these rights that we are entitled to.
[01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:07.238]  We need to take a stand to let the government know that we are tired of losing our rights.
[01:22:07.578 --> 01:22:09.198]  Today, you can take this stand.
[01:22:09.478 --> 01:22:14.700]  You can express your beliefs by wearing a new and innovative t-shirt available only through GCN.

[01:23:05.014 --> 01:23:07.676]  Aaron, take here in Austin and the other cities it's opening in.
[01:23:07.696 --> 01:23:12.199]  Aaron Rusar, our guest, the producer and director of America, Freedom from Fascism.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.782]  Is it going to be airing throughout the weekend here in Austin, or is it just this single play tonight?
[01:23:17.062 --> 01:23:20.685]  Oh, no, it's playing throughout the weekend, throughout next week.
[01:23:21.184 --> 01:23:22.544]  Good, fantastic.
[01:23:22.984 --> 01:23:26.885]  Do you ballpark know how many showings, or do we just need to go to the website to find out?
[01:23:27.186 --> 01:23:32.167]  The website, I'll tell you, I don't know exactly, but it's going to be playing out.
[01:23:32.367 --> 01:23:34.147]  We need people to go this weekend.
[01:23:34.727 --> 01:23:36.248]  You know, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[01:23:36.328 --> 01:23:37.348]  This is going to be the critical.
[01:23:37.508 --> 01:23:40.729]  Those three days are going to be the critical time for this movie.
[01:23:41.469 --> 01:23:46.630]  Whether you're in Tampa or Austin or Kansas City, wherever you are, Chicago, New York, go this weekend.
[01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:48.671]  We need a huge, big opening weekend.
[01:23:49.406 --> 01:23:53.647]  If we get that big U jumping weekend, everybody's going to be jumping online to stream the movie further.
[01:23:54.027 --> 01:23:55.087]  That's fantastic.
[01:23:55.627 --> 01:23:56.488]  Get more into the film.
[01:23:56.508 --> 01:24:01.189]  You don't just get into the Federal Reserve and its henchmen at the IRS.
[01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:03.089]  You get into the bigger picture, too.
[01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.669]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:04.869]  Well, that's the important thing.
[01:24:04.889 --> 01:24:08.130]  That's the decision I had to make when I was making the movie.
[01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.591]  It started out to be about the IRS.
[01:24:11.271 --> 01:24:15.652]  Originally, the movie was called April 15th, The Real April Fool's Day.
[01:24:16.512 --> 01:24:16.612]  And...
[01:24:18.024 --> 01:24:18.784]  I was making that movie.
[01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:25.147]  I said, you know, as much as I love this subject matter, this movie has to be about a lot more than that.
[01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:29.909]  Because to me, the IRS was just part of the bigger picture, you know, part of the overall police state.
[01:24:30.489 --> 01:24:32.990]  So then I got, so then I brought it to the Federal Reserve System.
[01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:37.692]  And as I got to the Federal Reserve, I realized that that would take us into the police state.
[01:24:38.472 --> 01:24:41.834]  And about the national ID card we have to have by May 2008.
[01:24:42.354 --> 01:24:44.615]  And the chips that they're doing, the RFID chips,
[01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:49.213]  And then I said, ultimately, this all leads to the New World Order, the One World Order.
[01:24:49.233 --> 01:24:50.134]  That's what it's really about.
[01:24:50.194 --> 01:24:52.735]  And the immigration issue and all those kind of things.
[01:24:52.976 --> 01:25:06.045]  And so I had to take the movie from 1913 when everything started up through the New World Order where we are today and what David Rockefeller and the various globalists have in mind for us.
[01:25:06.686 --> 01:25:10.929]  And it's very important that it was all tied together in one piece.
[01:25:11.533 --> 01:25:13.174]  So that people would see the big picture.
[01:25:14.794 --> 01:25:24.819]  So as opposed to just making a movie about the IRS, I tried to lay out a movie that would deal with the whole situation, with the IRS being part of it, as opposed to the picture.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:34.923]  You know, we talk in the movie about how Josiah Stamp from the Bank of England talks about how
[01:25:35.802 --> 01:25:46.090]  You know, if you took all the money away from the central bankers, but you gave them the power to create money, in the flick of an instant, they'd own everything back.
[01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:47.911]  They'd make enough money to buy it all back.
[01:25:50.013 --> 01:25:52.895]  We've allowed these people to make whatever money they want to make out of thin air.
[01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:55.217]  They bought our government.
[01:25:55.237 --> 01:25:56.638]  They buy whatever they want to buy.
[01:25:56.998 --> 01:25:58.479]  They have no limit to what they can do.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.060]  And they're not audited.
[01:26:00.441 --> 01:26:01.261]  It's a joke.
[01:26:01.862 --> 01:26:03.263]  You know, it's beyond a crime.
[01:26:05.171 --> 01:26:12.818]  You know, and so this is information that people thought the Federal Reserve was a federal agency.
[01:26:13.398 --> 01:26:15.901]  And we explained to them it's no more federal than Federal Express.
[01:26:16.361 --> 01:26:23.728]  Well, this is huge, and it's going to have a huge effect regardless of how many theaters it's in, but I imagine it's going to end up being in quite a few.
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.941]  I think it's going to have a massive effect.
[01:26:25.961 --> 01:26:26.881]  Tell us about Joe Bannister.
[01:26:26.901 --> 01:26:31.203]  He's in the film, and he's going to be joining us, both of us together, in this next segment.
[01:26:50.533 --> 01:26:51.354]  Well, I love Joe.
[01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:53.295]  I mean, Joe is just, you know, he's a hero.
[01:26:53.335 --> 01:26:53.876]  He really is.
[01:26:53.896 --> 01:26:57.638]  He's like Gary Coop used to be in the old days, you know.
[01:26:58.059 --> 01:27:00.020]  Joe's a very, very special man, you know.
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:10.108]  He was a criminal investigator for the IRS, and he's actually, you know, one of the reasons I made the movie, because people like Joe stood up and started talking about it, which is how I learned about this.
[01:27:10.868 --> 01:27:17.053]  And Joe's a stand-up guy who I have tremendous respect for, I admire greatly.
[01:27:17.646 --> 01:27:28.386]  And Joe in the movie expresses the fact that when he tried to go to the IRS and say, look, he's hearing all these stories, you know, couldn't they help him see through the problem here?
[01:27:28.406 --> 01:27:30.190]  They gave him his resignation papers.
[01:27:30.751 --> 01:27:33.514]  They don't want to answer any questions, because they can't answer the questions.
[01:27:33.694 --> 01:27:34.695]  Well, the story's incredible.
[01:27:34.715 --> 01:27:37.978]  You know, I was the first person on radio or for television to interview Joe.
[01:27:38.378 --> 01:27:42.923]  I guess that was back in the late 1990s, right after he had just resigned.
[01:27:43.704 --> 01:27:47.287]  And he was listening to a talk radio show in Central California.
[01:27:47.627 --> 01:27:48.148]  Heard D.B.
[01:27:48.188 --> 01:27:49.109]  Kidd on the radio.
[01:27:49.489 --> 01:27:54.134]  Didn't believe this well-spoken lady on a talk show host he respected laying out all the federal documents.
[01:27:54.174 --> 01:27:55.175]  So for two years...
[01:27:55.615 --> 01:27:55.735]  Yes.
[01:27:55.755 --> 01:27:59.997]  As a matter of fact, I had a big battle with David K. Johnston from the New York Times about Joe the other day.
[01:28:23.826 --> 01:28:26.727]  You know, so that didn't prove anything that Joe was acquitted, you know.
[01:28:27.047 --> 01:28:29.188]  No one's ever beaten the IRS in court.
[01:28:29.228 --> 01:28:30.449]  I said, what are you talking about?
[01:28:30.469 --> 01:28:32.270]  And this guy started yelling at me.
[01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:40.253]  He said, no Supreme Court decision ever said... Yeah, but that guy's admittedly on... Well, we'll talk about that piece of garbage when we get back.
[01:28:40.554 --> 01:28:40.994]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.635 --> 01:28:44.555]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.036 --> 01:28:46.616]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.636 --> 01:28:50.278]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.723 --> 01:28:56.403]  Hey, Bill.
[01:28:56.763 --> 01:28:57.844]  I'm buying lunch today.
[01:28:58.164 --> 01:28:58.985]  And check this out.
[01:28:59.305 --> 01:29:00.206]  I bought a new car.
[01:29:00.286 --> 01:29:00.926]  Wow, John.
[01:29:00.986 --> 01:29:05.510]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:10.233]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[01:29:10.553 --> 01:29:15.457]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:29:15.877 --> 01:29:18.279]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:21.961]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[01:29:22.221 --> 01:29:23.102]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[01:29:23.462 --> 01:29:25.863]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[01:29:26.223 --> 01:29:28.464]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[01:29:28.584 --> 01:29:29.245]  It's incredible!
[01:29:29.625 --> 01:29:37.089]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[01:29:37.409 --> 01:29:41.952]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:29:42.944 --> 01:29:43.645]  Check, please.
[01:29:44.106 --> 01:29:44.988]  I got this one, Bill.
[01:29:45.388 --> 01:29:46.070]  Sure, John.
[01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:50.818]  Let's tell everyone about www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:29:50.958 --> 01:29:51.219]  Deal.
[01:29:53.214 --> 01:29:59.457]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:59.597 --> 01:30:05.761]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:14.485]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:14.725 --> 01:30:21.729]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:26.872]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.072 --> 01:30:32.496]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:32.836 --> 01:30:35.898]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:36.239 --> 01:30:44.164]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.244 --> 01:30:44.824]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:56.931]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:30:57.071 --> 01:30:59.232]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:30:59.512 --> 01:31:09.597]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:12.238]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[01:31:12.418 --> 01:31:12.878]  We're good to go.
[01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:40.019]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[01:31:40.219 --> 01:31:42.740]  Call today for a Calvin Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.141]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalvinPureSoap.com.
[01:32:00.276 --> 01:32:07.986]  We'll be going right back to our guests, the director, the producer of America, Freedom of Fascism, Aaron Russo, and of course, Joe Bannister joining us.
[01:32:08.947 --> 01:32:15.255]  Before we do that, I want to remind you that this hour is brought to you by Cal Bend 5 Star Soap Products.
[01:32:15.996 --> 01:32:19.700]  They were set up in 1947 owned by the same family.
[01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:20.781]  They're all organic.
[01:32:21.222 --> 01:32:24.645]  There are no chemicals, dyes, pesticides in these.
[01:32:24.685 --> 01:32:27.889]  They're made out of vegetables and citrus oils.
[01:32:28.569 --> 01:32:31.893]  And this is what I use in my home for washing our clothes.
[01:32:32.433 --> 01:32:36.136]  Our dishes and in the shower is bar soap and shampoo.
[01:32:36.556 --> 01:32:37.377]  It is wonderful.
[01:32:37.397 --> 01:32:44.162]  And, folks, you can go buy organic soap at Whole Foods or, you know, at the different shops, and it's like twice as much as store-bought soap.
[01:32:44.442 --> 01:32:52.949]  Well, Calvin Pure Soap is 25% the cost of the chemical soaps and a lot cheaper than the expensive organic soaps.
[01:32:53.847 --> 01:32:55.268]  That's because you buy it in bulk.
[01:32:55.288 --> 01:32:57.348]  A month's supply, a year's supply, a two-year supply.
[01:32:57.668 --> 01:33:03.550]  Give them a call and get a free catalog, or talk to them, or get their $14 sampler packet.
[01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:09.052]  It's so important.
[01:33:09.072 --> 01:33:09.472]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:33:09.492 --> 01:33:09.832]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:33:09.852 --> 01:33:11.613]  Or calbinshop.com.
[01:33:11.633 --> 01:33:15.954]  There's a big fat banner on the left-hand side of infowars.com.
[01:33:15.974 --> 01:33:19.275]  You can link through right there to Cal Ben Pierce's website or call toll-free.
[01:33:19.295 --> 01:33:19.355]  1-800-340-7091.
[01:33:22.376 --> 01:33:23.457]  It's made in America.
[01:33:23.517 --> 01:33:24.457]  It's family owned.
[01:33:24.517 --> 01:33:25.478]  You save a lot of money.
[01:33:25.858 --> 01:33:26.758]  It's not toxic.
[01:33:26.898 --> 01:33:27.559]  It's organic.
[01:33:27.659 --> 01:33:28.279]  It's wonderful.
[01:33:28.539 --> 01:33:29.740]  We use it here in the office.
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:32.541]  Just wait until you smell the bar soap.
[01:33:32.601 --> 01:33:33.762]  It's just incredible.
[01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:36.243]  And believe me, you're going, bar soap?
[01:33:36.263 --> 01:33:37.043]  Wait until you smell it.
[01:33:37.123 --> 01:33:38.564]  Just wait until you do.
[01:33:39.044 --> 01:33:40.445]  Alright, going back to Aaron Russo.
[01:33:41.619 --> 01:33:43.662]  Opening in theaters, dotted across the U.S.
[01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:44.843]  today, including here in Austin.
[01:33:45.223 --> 01:33:47.706]  I'll be introducing it and giving a question and answer at the end.
[01:33:47.726 --> 01:33:49.789]  I feel honored that Aaron asked me to do this.
[01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:52.432]  And it's America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:33:52.772 --> 01:33:54.374]  And Joe Bannister has now joined us.
[01:33:54.414 --> 01:33:56.937]  Joe, we were just talking about you before you joined us.
[01:33:56.977 --> 01:33:58.159]  Were your ears burning?
[01:33:59.869 --> 01:34:03.491]  Well, actually, somebody connected me, and I actually was hearing what you were saying.
[01:34:04.352 --> 01:34:07.013]  Well, for those that don't know who you are, first, I commend you for joining us.
[01:34:07.033 --> 01:34:08.234]  I'm glad you're in this movie.
[01:34:08.915 --> 01:34:19.741]  Tell us, just in kind of a thumbnail sketch nutshell, about yourself, what happened, then how they criminally charged you, how you won that historical case, and about this movie.
[01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:24.023]  Well, let's see if I can put that into a nutshell.
[01:34:24.503 --> 01:34:25.964]  I began with the IRS in 1993.
[01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:29.243]  I worked there until 99.
[01:34:30.283 --> 01:34:36.386]  I expected to spend a full 20-year career with the IRS, serving my country, protecting the Treasury.
[01:34:36.406 --> 01:34:50.454]  It sounds corny, but I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I know that taxation is necessary, government is necessary, and I wanted to be one of the honorable cogs in that wheel.
[01:34:51.694 --> 01:34:56.777]  And about two years into my career there, three years actually,
[01:34:57.347 --> 01:35:11.194]  I heard this claim that the income tax was largely a voluntary system and that when you look at the laws that required compliance, it didn't apply to as large a group as the IRS led the public to believe.
[01:35:12.014 --> 01:35:18.417]  And I thought it was a crazy claim, but it was made on a show, a radio show, somebody that I found to be pretty trustworthy.
[01:35:18.437 --> 01:35:23.620]  So I went ahead and started to investigate just on evenings and weekends.
[01:35:24.749 --> 01:35:45.879]  You know, during the day I'd be going to work carrying my gun and badge for the IRS, and I was astounded to find after a couple of years of part-time research that I could not poke holes in this overall claim that the IRS was knowingly deceiving the public and basically knowingly breaking the law.
[01:35:46.939 --> 01:35:53.202]  So I confronted my supervisors, feeling that I really had no other choice than to go to my supervisors
[01:35:53.641 --> 01:36:04.831]  At the IRS, the same ones who took the same oath that I did and figuring that they have similar integrity and said, you know, what do I do about this?
[01:36:04.931 --> 01:36:08.054]  I mean, I've tried to poke holes in these arguments.
[01:36:08.334 --> 01:36:15.360]  Of course, I find some that are out there, but the core seems to really have some merit.
[01:36:15.881 --> 01:36:20.745]  And I'm a CPA, and I've got a degree in accounting, and, you know, why is it I can't
[01:36:21.565 --> 01:36:26.549]  I can't poke holes in these principal arguments of these so-called tax protesters.
[01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:34.997]  And rather than try to help me, try to explain to me where I went wrong in my analysis, they just said, we're not going to answer your questions.
[01:36:35.477 --> 01:36:35.938]  Resign.
[01:36:37.599 --> 01:36:39.541]  And so I did, and that was February of 1999.
[01:36:39.681 --> 01:36:40.542]  And from February 1999 until...
[01:36:45.071 --> 01:36:53.853]  November of 2004, I basically just went back to doing accounting work and representing people with IRS matters.
[01:36:54.773 --> 01:37:02.494]  And in November of 2004, the government indicted me on a conspiracy to defraud the United States of America.
[01:37:03.714 --> 01:37:06.775]  And they tried to put me in prison for three or four years.
[01:37:09.135 --> 01:37:12.976]  And that was really the only time up to that point when...
[01:37:13.635 --> 01:37:26.201]  We actually had just regular citizens evaluating my conduct and my integrity as opposed to these government tribunals that so much run our government.
[01:37:27.121 --> 01:37:37.046]  And the jury found that my conduct during the period that the government was alleging I was doing bad things was actually quite sound.
[01:37:38.462 --> 01:37:40.643]  Full of integrity and honesty.
[01:37:40.943 --> 01:37:48.344]  What did the judge and the prosecutor do when they stood up and said, we the jury find Joseph Bannister not guilty on these counts?
[01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:56.766]  Well, I think the prosecution was kind of thinking, they kind of got wind that things weren't going their way.
[01:37:56.786 --> 01:38:04.328]  It was a female and a male prosecutor, and the female prosecutor did not even show up for the verdict.
[01:38:06.409 --> 01:38:07.189]  What did the judge do?
[01:38:08.802 --> 01:38:16.208]  The judge, well, really our judge, Judge Shub, there in Sacramento, I have to say was relatively fair.
[01:38:16.628 --> 01:38:18.890]  I mean, he let us put on a defense.
[01:38:20.221 --> 01:38:24.564]  He didn't let the prosecution walk all over us if they were going to break the law doing so.
[01:38:24.744 --> 01:38:36.650]  Now, for those that don't know, the IRS was really persecuting you because you were traveling the country in full-page ads in USA Today and other places, exposing the fraud, and they were really trying, I guess, to shut you up and punish you.
[01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:43.053]  They were able to punish Erwin Schiff, and the judge said on record, I don't allow the law in my court.
[01:38:43.093 --> 01:38:48.076]  We've got other judges, one in Denver two years ago, saying, I don't allow the Constitution.
[01:38:48.736 --> 01:38:49.497]  In my court.
[01:38:49.517 --> 01:38:55.724]  Aaron Russo, how important is this when we have these judges and others saying they don't allow the law and the Constitution in court?
[01:38:59.548 --> 01:39:02.030]  It's a total breakdown of what our country's about.
[01:39:02.451 --> 01:39:09.578]  Our country's supposed to be a nation of law, and now you have judges that determine what the law is and make law instead of the Congress.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:13.843]  And they've convinced juries that they should find people guilty.
[01:39:14.023 --> 01:39:16.385]  Isn't that similar to Bush with 800 plus?
[01:39:16.425 --> 01:39:17.666]  It was 750, folks.
[01:39:17.726 --> 01:39:20.948]  I said 800 yesterday with a guest, and they said, Alex, you said 750.
[01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:22.389]  In the last two months, it's now 800.
[01:39:22.469 --> 01:39:32.316]  It's 800 plus, so it's 50 more cases of Bush just saying on torture, open borders, corruption, bid rigging, no bid contracts, you name it.
[01:39:32.336 --> 01:39:33.637]  He just says we're above the law.
[01:39:33.697 --> 01:39:34.438]  We are the law.
[01:39:34.458 --> 01:39:35.659]  I mean, isn't that called tyranny?
[01:39:36.274 --> 01:39:37.594]  Well, obviously it's called tyranny.
[01:39:38.075 --> 01:39:38.895]  We know what's happening.
[01:39:38.915 --> 01:39:40.795]  I'm sure the listeners in your show know what's happening.
[01:39:41.296 --> 01:39:45.717]  And the question is, for me, is not defining it anymore, but how to defeat it.
[01:39:46.297 --> 01:39:49.438]  You know, we all know what's happening in this country, but how do we defeat it?
[01:39:49.678 --> 01:39:54.720]  Which is why I made the movie, and why what Joe Bannister did is so important, and what you're doing is so important.
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.402]  We have to pull together, you know, because if we don't hang together, we're going to certainly hang separately.
[01:39:59.882 --> 01:40:01.522]  Joe, you've seen the movie, you're in the movie.
[01:40:01.542 --> 01:40:03.443]  What do you think of America, Freedom from Fascism?
[01:40:05.178 --> 01:40:09.180]  Well, I'm in love with it, even if I had ended up on the cutting room floor.
[01:40:11.062 --> 01:40:12.343]  Thanks to Aaron.
[01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:16.426]  I do have a little role to play, and I'm happy that I could do so.
[01:40:16.446 --> 01:40:32.418]  But like I say, without me, the testimony and interviews by so many credible people, including, and we have to give thanks to David K. Johnson, even though I'm in agreement with you guys as far as...
[01:40:33.581 --> 01:40:35.603]  The poor guy's head is awfully thick.
[01:40:35.683 --> 01:40:36.944]  His skull is awfully thick.
[01:40:37.544 --> 01:40:50.394]  But, you know, it was that question that he asked of the commissioner, the current commissioner at the time and still the commissioner, Everson, about this group of people standing outside.
[01:40:50.534 --> 01:40:52.776]  And I was in that group of people standing outside.
[01:40:52.796 --> 01:40:54.357]  For those who don't know, fill in the background.
[01:40:54.377 --> 01:40:55.758]  Tell us the story you're getting into.
[01:40:56.478 --> 01:41:02.243]  Well, David K. Johnson of the New York Times has been kind of a thorn in the side of all of us who
[01:41:03.167 --> 01:41:08.831]  Of course, believe that we're doing the right thing and the honorable thing by exposing these issues.
[01:41:09.672 --> 01:41:23.762]  But he actually sat in a press conference that was hosted by the Internal Revenue Service, and he point-blank asked the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mark Everson, is there a law that requires people to pay taxes?
[01:41:23.982 --> 01:41:26.904]  Now, I'm upset that he didn't say income taxes.
[01:41:26.944 --> 01:41:28.505]  He used the generic taxes.
[01:41:28.585 --> 01:41:32.528]  But nonetheless, he point-blank asked the Commissioner.
[01:41:33.328 --> 01:41:46.453]  And, of course, Aaron included this clip in the movie, and that's unheard of, to be able to have that kind of question directed at an official and have them answer it and not dodge it.
[01:41:46.473 --> 01:41:47.433]  We only get the answer.
[01:41:49.213 --> 01:41:53.275]  Yeah, we won't give it away, but, I mean, it is just phenomenal.
[01:41:53.315 --> 01:42:02.258]  So, again, David K. Johnston, I think, he always talks about that there aren't any wins, which, of course, that in and of itself is incorrect.
[01:42:02.878 --> 01:42:10.042]  But the only way the government can win is if they cut your legs and arms off and your tongue and then they say, go ahead and defend yourself.
[01:42:10.262 --> 01:42:12.283]  Exactly.
[01:42:12.323 --> 01:42:15.205]  That's not a matter of justice.
[01:42:15.525 --> 01:42:15.985]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:17.586]  Do you know what David K. Johnson said the other day?
[01:42:17.606 --> 01:42:19.207]  He called me up to do an interview with me.
[01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:25.671]  And he gets on the phone and he says, Dan, I'm doing this interview with you to see if I should give your movie any credibility.
[01:42:25.691 --> 01:42:30.113]  I said, wait, who says you have credibility to give my movie credibility?
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.561]  What do you mean you're going to give my movie credibility or not?
[01:42:34.122 --> 01:42:35.843]  It's just a show for the IRS, David.
[01:42:35.903 --> 01:42:36.363]  I know that.
[01:42:36.403 --> 01:42:37.403]  No matter what I say.
[01:42:37.503 --> 01:42:39.304]  He's like claiming he's the Pope or something.
[01:42:39.344 --> 01:42:41.225]  I mean, everything comes from him.
[01:42:41.846 --> 01:42:42.266]  Exactly.
[01:42:42.346 --> 01:42:44.247]  No matter what I say, you're going to write the same thing.
[01:42:44.267 --> 01:42:45.828]  It doesn't matter what I say.
[01:42:45.848 --> 01:42:47.388]  It doesn't matter what the truth is.
[01:42:47.969 --> 01:42:48.289]  You know?
[01:42:48.309 --> 01:42:50.710]  And he finally hung up on me, you know?
[01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:55.492]  But the fact of the matter happens to be that he was saying there were no Supreme Court decisions.
[01:42:56.113 --> 01:42:58.594]  He was saying Joe Banas' victory didn't mean anything.
[01:42:59.093 --> 01:43:00.996]  He was saying the IRS code is law.
[01:43:01.236 --> 01:43:04.261]  Not that the Congress... I mean, the guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:43:04.822 --> 01:43:05.123]  You know?
[01:43:05.323 --> 01:43:09.730]  And so I know he's going to write a real nasty article in the New York Times about the movie and about myself.
[01:43:10.071 --> 01:43:10.752]  Not that I care.
[01:43:10.772 --> 01:43:13.396]  But I think it's interesting that he got on the phone with the arrogance.
[01:43:13.968 --> 01:43:16.410]  And say, I'm here to give you movie credibility.
[01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:17.711]  But it shows their arrogance.
[01:43:17.731 --> 01:43:19.753]  We talked about this privately on the phone yesterday, Aaron.
[01:43:20.314 --> 01:43:36.148]  It's great that he's going to write a hit piece, and they're so delusional that they're the only people that have a voice and that they are, you know, Moses on the mountain, that they believe that when they attack you, everyone's going to believe it and not go see the movie when it's actually the opposite.
[01:43:36.388 --> 01:43:39.751]  People are going to read the New York Times calling you names and think that you must be a saint.
[01:43:40.752 --> 01:43:44.975]  They actually called me up today to ask me if they could do a portrait of me for the article.
[01:43:46.676 --> 01:43:47.757]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[01:43:47.837 --> 01:43:48.678]  They really are.
[01:43:49.078 --> 01:43:57.464]  They just put the two S's in Russo and one N in Bannister and two B's in Gibbons, and that's all we need, right?
[01:43:57.484 --> 01:43:58.525]  Well, exactly, Joe.
[01:43:58.685 --> 01:43:59.586]  But they also...
[01:44:00.839 --> 01:44:10.046]  You know, they're so arrogant that the point I'm trying to make is that when they call me up sometimes, major hit pieces, and I can tell it's a hit piece, I go, you know what, I don't want to do this interview.
[01:44:10.527 --> 01:44:11.808]  You're going to write whatever you want.
[01:44:12.188 --> 01:44:13.669]  Go ahead and do whatever you want.
[01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:16.952]  And it shocks them that we don't grovel and lick their boots.
[01:44:17.012 --> 01:44:28.441]  It shocks them that they are basically becoming an afterthought and a joke in the American people's minds, and they're just starting to realize that the people aren't buying their baloney anymore.
[01:44:28.781 --> 01:44:29.282]  Aaron, Joe?
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:32.022]  Well, what you're saying is exactly right.
[01:44:32.042 --> 01:44:33.843]  I mean, you took the words out of my mouth, in a sense.
[01:44:34.304 --> 01:44:39.548]  I mean, the fact is, though, that there are still many people through television who have no idea what's happening.
[01:44:39.568 --> 01:44:41.190]  That's why your work is so important.
[01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:44.072]  That's why it's so important we keep building this nucleus.
[01:44:44.553 --> 01:44:50.077]  You know, it's like, there's a nucleus of people who are standing up, like what Charlie Sheen did, I admire so much.
[01:44:50.618 --> 01:44:53.480]  And more and more people keep adding on to this nucleus.
[01:44:54.041 --> 01:44:55.142]  And that's what has to happen.
[01:44:55.603 --> 01:44:59.046]  And we have to work together to defeat them.
[01:44:59.066 --> 01:45:02.289]  Because they make the money, they have the army, they have everything.
[01:45:02.689 --> 01:45:03.790]  And they're also the liars.
[01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:05.491]  But we have the truth.
[01:45:05.871 --> 01:45:07.433]  We have the people and we have the truth.
[01:45:07.773 --> 01:45:09.254]  And we have to make that work for us.
[01:45:09.695 --> 01:45:11.316]  And that's the big battle that we're facing.
[01:45:12.119 --> 01:45:21.482]  Well, they've got imperial hubris, and they've been extremely arrogant for a while, but I'm starting to see a lot of their arrogance leave their demeanor, their body language, their statements.
[01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:25.443]  I think the New World Order is starting to figure out that we're giving them a run for their money.
[01:45:25.483 --> 01:45:26.043]  Joe Bannister?
[01:45:26.063 --> 01:45:35.346]  Well, I agree, but the thing is that they're going to try to run faster to the finish line, which means they're going to get more and more money.
[01:45:37.235 --> 01:45:37.756]  How should we say?
[01:45:37.816 --> 01:45:38.456]  Tyrannical.
[01:45:38.897 --> 01:45:56.751]  And so we just need to expand our numbers, infect the jury pool, so to speak, the public out there, and let them know what the truth is and let them know that the ball, the media, the dominant media has been hiding the ball.
[01:45:57.651 --> 01:46:00.554]  And the reason they've been hiding it is they don't want people to see the truth.
[01:46:00.574 --> 01:46:03.316]  They don't want people to see a movie like Aaron's
[01:46:03.996 --> 01:46:05.096]  And even question.
[01:46:05.316 --> 01:46:23.759]  I mean, whether every little piece of Aaron's movie is absolutely accurate, which as far as I can tell it is, but just getting people to think and question, which is the reason I don't work for the IRS anymore, because somebody got me to think about it and question it.
[01:46:24.199 --> 01:46:32.721]  And as soon as I started to use what the average intelligence I have and average education and training, and I've applied that to this issue,
[01:46:33.616 --> 01:46:34.497]  My eyes were opened.
[01:46:34.837 --> 01:46:38.219]  And that's exactly the beauty of what Aaron's movie is going to do.
[01:46:38.239 --> 01:46:42.141]  We just need to spread people the word and get the people in the theaters.
[01:46:43.075 --> 01:46:43.796]  You're absolutely right.
[01:46:43.836 --> 01:46:45.537]  And look at Romania and Ceausescu.
[01:46:45.557 --> 01:46:47.598]  He thought he had total control of that last day.
[01:46:47.618 --> 01:46:52.241]  And finally, the police, the military, the civil servants, everybody looked around and said, this is tyranny.
[01:46:52.521 --> 01:46:57.645]  Why are we living like this with surveillance cameras and secret arrests and out-of-control regulation and control?
[01:46:57.665 --> 01:47:00.467]  And I see that same process now.
[01:47:00.527 --> 01:47:01.968]  We have to believe we can win.
[01:47:02.268 --> 01:47:04.389]  We have to aggressively get out there and wake people up.
[01:47:04.770 --> 01:47:09.493]  Aaron Russo run through, you know, we talk about the Federal Reserve, you get into that in the film, the IRS, that system.
[01:47:10.053 --> 01:47:11.634]  What are some of the other things you hit in the film?
[01:47:11.654 --> 01:47:14.957]  I know you hit spy chips, the RFID, the implantable chips.
[01:47:14.997 --> 01:47:16.318]  What are some of the other things you hit in the film?
[01:47:16.538 --> 01:47:18.540]  Well, the ID cards that are coming in May 2008.
[01:47:19.701 --> 01:47:24.724]  You know, we discuss a lot of the laws of the past that are totally tyrannical.
[01:47:25.285 --> 01:47:29.148]  You know, we discuss how Bill Clinton and George Bush are no different.
[01:47:29.688 --> 01:47:39.793]  That no matter which, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, you know, it's time to stop being a good Democrat, it's time to stop being a good Republican, and it's time to start being a good American.
[01:47:39.973 --> 01:47:42.434]  So you shatter the false left-right paradigm.
[01:47:42.754 --> 01:47:43.454]  Exactly.
[01:47:43.514 --> 01:47:45.835]  That's the whole point, because that's how they keep it divided.
[01:47:46.135 --> 01:47:53.198]  This movie, to me, is like The Wizard of Oz, when they open the curtain, you see the wizard behind, playing with the, you know, with the... Control panel, yeah.
[01:47:53.499 --> 01:47:54.859]  Right, that's what this movie does.
[01:47:54.879 --> 01:47:56.740]  This movie exposes the Federal Reserve.
[01:47:57.750 --> 01:48:00.032]  People think the Federal Reserve is a government agency.
[01:48:00.392 --> 01:48:01.773]  They don't know it's private banks.
[01:48:02.554 --> 01:48:04.975]  And this movie opens up the door so people get it.
[01:48:05.696 --> 01:48:07.737]  And that's the most important thing about this movie.
[01:48:07.757 --> 01:48:08.738]  They know there's no law.
[01:48:08.998 --> 01:48:10.219]  They understand the Federal Reserve.
[01:48:10.239 --> 01:48:14.502]  They know where we're heading into the New World Order and how all the banks are working together.
[01:48:14.522 --> 01:48:19.385]  And there's a solution at the end of how to win and how to stop it.
[01:48:19.865 --> 01:48:22.067]  And what I'm saying to everybody today is,
[01:48:22.853 --> 01:48:25.014]  Please go to the theater this weekend.
[01:48:25.635 --> 01:48:29.257]  You know, that's the very least... We have a huge weekend box office.
[01:48:29.738 --> 01:48:31.479]  This movie's going to spread across the country.
[01:48:31.519 --> 01:48:32.980]  And they don't want this movie to spread.
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:34.421]  They want to stop it dead.
[01:48:34.701 --> 01:48:37.323]  That's why they call the radio stations and tell them not to put me on.
[01:48:37.763 --> 01:48:39.784]  I mean, they're afraid of what's happening here.
[01:48:40.044 --> 01:48:41.125]  They're afraid of people waking up.
[01:48:41.145 --> 01:48:43.767]  You know, the internet has been huge for us.
[01:48:45.121 --> 01:48:46.703]  Well, it certainly has.
[01:48:46.723 --> 01:48:49.905]  For those who don't know, that's how films work with a platform release.
[01:48:50.366 --> 01:48:53.868]  Most films are a platform release, not a bunch of radio and TV ads.
[01:48:53.888 --> 01:48:59.413]  What you have is limited theaters in big cities where then the distributors gauge
[01:48:59.993 --> 01:49:04.515]  I really don't know that answer at this moment in time, but after we pull it out of the theaters, see, as long as
[01:49:29.446 --> 01:49:30.046]  It's in the theaters.
[01:49:30.086 --> 01:49:32.047]  The theaters won't allow a DVD to come out.
[01:49:32.587 --> 01:49:33.387]  Yes, I understand that.
[01:49:33.647 --> 01:49:33.887]  Right?
[01:49:33.947 --> 01:49:38.189]  So it really depends on how long we're in the theaters for.
[01:49:38.729 --> 01:49:39.129]  All right.
[01:49:39.689 --> 01:49:41.970]  But within six months, I think we should see a DVD then.
[01:49:42.010 --> 01:49:42.910]  I think so, yeah.
[01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:45.851]  I mean, small release, big release, six months, either way.
[01:49:46.151 --> 01:49:46.791]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:46.831 --> 01:49:48.852]  Final segment, Joe Bannister and Aaron Russo.
[01:49:49.212 --> 01:49:50.392]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:49:56.741 --> 01:49:59.944]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.284 --> 01:50:02.226]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.586 --> 01:50:10.252]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.933 --> 01:50:17.979]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.379 --> 01:50:21.322]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.642 --> 01:50:24.024]  The White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.444 --> 01:50:25.245]  NSA spies.

[01:53:08.827 --> 01:53:14.228]  Tomorrow night, C-SPAN 1, American Perspectives, 8 p.m.
[01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:14.588]  Eastern.
[01:53:14.608 --> 01:53:21.050]  They're going to air the roundtable panel discussion from our 9-11 neocon agenda out in L.A.
[01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:22.330]  late last month.
[01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:24.991]  That is finally going to air, and it will air again at 11 o'clock Eastern.
[01:53:25.451 --> 01:53:29.192]  That way folks can watch it at, what, 9 o'clock Pacific.
[01:53:29.212 --> 01:53:30.932]  So it's going to air back-to-back, basically.
[01:53:31.778 --> 01:53:36.260]  It's almost two hours long coming up Saturday night.
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:37.280]  It's on their schedule.
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:38.380]  They claim they're airing it.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:42.081]  I'm pinching myself because we come right out with 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:53:42.402 --> 01:53:49.524]  Go to infowars.com and prisonplunder.com and be sure to get the press releases about this event and get it out to everybody so people can watch it on C-SPAN.
[01:53:49.564 --> 01:53:49.984]  Tape it.
[01:53:50.424 --> 01:53:51.225]  Get it out to others.
[01:53:51.305 --> 01:53:52.385]  It's extremely powerful.
[01:53:53.085 --> 01:53:57.247]  And make sure that you also, if you don't have cable, you can still watch it online.
[01:53:57.627 --> 01:54:05.030]  We've got links up on Infowars.com and PrisonPundit.com to the C-SPAN streaming web servers, so you can watch it as they put it out live.
[01:54:06.133 --> 01:54:06.914]  We're good to go.
[01:54:06.934 --> 01:54:07.254]  We're good to go.
[01:54:27.751 --> 01:54:28.351]  We're good to go.
[01:54:28.411 --> 01:54:29.232]  We're good to go.
[01:54:51.066 --> 01:54:55.450]  Terror Storm, my best film, most professional, professional Hollywood score, symphony to the music.
[01:54:56.130 --> 01:54:57.091]  This is my best film yet.
[01:54:57.351 --> 01:55:00.433]  Be sure and go to Infowars.com and get a copy of Terror Storm.
[01:55:00.473 --> 01:55:01.274]  Get it and make copies.
[01:55:01.314 --> 01:55:02.174]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:55:02.475 --> 01:55:12.422]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv because by supporting this radio show, you support a free platform that can then energize and support the other nucleuses
[01:55:12.722 --> 01:55:15.224]  Well, for me, having you on the air is an amazing thing.
[01:55:15.504 --> 01:55:25.371]  And from my point of view, if the people of America would just get together and stop fighting with each other and just support yourself, what you're doing, what I'm doing, what Joe does,
[01:55:42.028 --> 01:55:43.309]  I mean, really support it.
[01:55:43.509 --> 01:55:44.369]  Sometimes you need money.
[01:55:44.389 --> 01:55:46.710]  There's a battle going on.
[01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:51.092]  I often think about what George Washington and the Founding Fathers did to get us our freedom.
[01:55:51.632 --> 01:55:56.334]  And I wonder why the American people today, even those who know what's wrong, don't step up more.
[01:55:56.834 --> 01:55:58.575]  And that, to me, is my biggest frustration.
[01:55:58.595 --> 01:56:02.357]  They leave it to people like yourself or myself or Joe to do the fighting.
[01:56:02.817 --> 01:56:06.058]  And we need people out there who at least show up for the movie.
[01:56:06.158 --> 01:56:07.379]  Do what you've got to do.
[01:56:07.972 --> 01:56:09.252]  Just so we can win this battle.
[01:56:09.292 --> 01:56:09.772]  Well, I agree.
[01:56:09.792 --> 01:56:12.673]  I think people have lacked hope, but I think they're starting to see that we can win.
[01:56:12.733 --> 01:56:14.053]  Joe Bannister, closing comments?
[01:56:15.393 --> 01:56:19.274]  Well, I would just kind of dovetail with what Aaron was saying.
[01:56:19.294 --> 01:56:28.415]  The tyrants cannot succeed without the help of the public, even though the public may not be knowingly helping them.
[01:56:28.916 --> 01:56:31.596]  They are by their ignorance and by their fear.
[01:56:32.136 --> 01:56:37.457]  And then also the law enforcement, the government employees out there, there's a lot of good ones.
[01:56:38.101 --> 01:56:39.823]  And you need to get out there.
[01:56:39.903 --> 01:56:44.327]  Everybody has a friend or a family member who's in government or who's in law enforcement.
[01:56:45.107 --> 01:56:47.509]  And you need to get those people in to see this movie.
[01:56:48.410 --> 01:56:49.871]  You need to open their eyes.
[01:56:50.332 --> 01:56:58.739]  And when the public's eyes are open and the law enforcement eyes are open, you'll see that the tyrants will become helpless.
[01:56:59.631 --> 01:57:01.472]  Well, everybody needs to see this movie.
[01:57:01.612 --> 01:57:04.154]  It is a paradigm-destroying movie.
[01:57:04.174 --> 01:57:06.255]  It is a paradigm-shifting film.
[01:57:06.375 --> 01:57:07.516]  It is explosive.
[01:57:08.096 --> 01:57:13.439]  Every American, every person on this planet should see America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:17.162]  You've knocked it out of the park yet again, Aaron Russo.
[01:57:17.462 --> 01:57:19.423]  And Joe Bannister, thank you for your courage as well.
[01:57:19.463 --> 01:57:20.183]  I'll see everybody.
[01:57:21.324 --> 01:57:27.428]  In fact, when we get back in the next hour, our guest will be gone, but I'll tell you which specific theater showing it here in Austin and tell you how to come there.
[01:57:27.688 --> 01:57:28.809]  Gentlemen, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:57:28.829 --> 01:57:29.209]  Alison.
[01:57:29.369 --> 01:57:31.030]  Thank you so much, and God bless you, buddy.
[01:57:31.090 --> 01:57:31.390]  You bet.
[01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:31.811]  God bless you.
[01:57:33.632 --> 01:57:37.534]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.854 --> 01:57:39.955]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:40.015 --> 01:57:44.078]  Hello, folks!
[01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:50.542]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.182 --> 01:57:52.263]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.943 --> 01:57:54.044]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.704 --> 01:57:55.525]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.265 --> 01:57:57.046]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.834 --> 01:58:01.775]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.995 --> 01:58:06.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.201]  Welcome into this third hour.
[01:58:21.801 --> 01:58:23.682]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:24.827 --> 01:58:36.690]  On this Friday edition, the 28th day of July 2006, the first hour we went to the Middle East and got a report on DU being used, chemical, biological weapons being used.
[01:58:36.710 --> 01:58:46.193]  We know the munitions that carry them have been photographed and how the UN peacekeepers have been deliberately targeted to get rid of witnesses of Israeli atrocities.
[01:58:47.073 --> 01:58:53.375]  Last hour we talked about America, freedom to fascism that premieres tonight at AMC Barton Creek.
[01:58:54.710 --> 01:58:55.491]  We're good to go.
[01:58:56.552 --> 01:58:57.233]  We're good to go.
[01:59:17.634 --> 01:59:20.655]  In this hour, we're going to have wide-open phones.
[01:59:20.735 --> 01:59:22.915]  It's 1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:59:22.935 --> 01:59:28.496]  My websites, of course, are Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, MartialLaw911.info, PrisonPlanet.com, and Infowars.com.
[01:59:28.556 --> 01:59:29.776]  Be sure and check them out daily.
[01:59:44.634 --> 01:59:45.174]  I think we're good to go.
[02:00:13.866 --> 02:00:18.270]  Synthetic compounds the government's produced and then put out on the black market to then create a phony drug war.
[02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.691]  Oh yes.
[02:00:19.371 --> 02:00:23.135]  They also simulate what natural compounds in the body do.
[02:00:24.416 --> 02:00:28.620]  So this is really big news because I've been talking about this for years and now it's in the Washington Post.
[02:00:29.261 --> 02:00:34.044]  Big news on the police state here domestically and a lot more coming up.
[02:00:34.104 --> 02:00:35.805]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[02:00:35.905 --> 02:00:37.146]  David in San Francisco.
[02:00:37.206 --> 02:00:37.847]  Go ahead, David.
[02:00:38.527 --> 02:00:39.348]  Hi, Alex.
[02:00:39.428 --> 02:00:40.328]  That was a good interview.
[02:00:40.909 --> 02:00:44.691]  I was actually hoping to talk to Aaron Russo and myself.
[02:00:45.252 --> 02:00:51.256]  We've got a little Internet radio station out here in San Francisco based through IndieBay.org.
[02:00:51.796 --> 02:00:57.960]  And he's also going to premiere another movie just, I guess, tomorrow night called Valley of the Wolves.
[02:00:58.533 --> 02:01:02.876]  And that's kind of a significant one about atrocities in Iraq.
[02:01:03.276 --> 02:01:09.820]  But I don't know if you caught, let's see, on the 19th, the Senate Banking Committee... Did he make Valley of the Wolves, too?
[02:01:10.681 --> 02:01:12.422]  I think he's tied to it.
[02:01:12.542 --> 02:01:17.726]  We got the link through him, and he may be an executive producer.
[02:01:17.746 --> 02:01:19.727]  Well, he's a busy little being.
[02:01:20.087 --> 02:01:20.868]  Oh, I know, I know.
[02:01:21.068 --> 02:01:27.292]  And that's going to show, I think, in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, as well as a number of other...
[02:01:27.959 --> 02:01:32.482]  About six different cities around the nation, L.A., New York, Florida.
[02:01:32.883 --> 02:01:33.043]  Good.
[02:01:33.083 --> 02:01:33.843]  What else is on your mind?
[02:01:34.164 --> 02:01:39.107]  Well, the other thing, on the 19th, the Senate Banking Committee had Bernicke on.
[02:01:39.207 --> 02:01:40.268]  I don't know if you caught that.
[02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:43.270]  It's still on C-SPAN in their archives.
[02:01:43.290 --> 02:01:43.771]  Well, I know.
[02:01:43.811 --> 02:01:44.771]  I've got an AP article.
[02:01:44.831 --> 02:01:46.833]  Inflation numbers are way up today.
[02:01:46.873 --> 02:01:49.235]  I think I'm going to get to that later.
[02:01:49.515 --> 02:01:52.517]  There's a quote, though, and I even have it queued up if you want it.
[02:01:54.315 --> 02:01:58.997]  Bernanke is asked by one of the Senators, and I can't quite tell who the Senator is.
[02:01:59.157 --> 02:02:00.757]  But it's Fed Chairman for those that don't know.
[02:02:00.777 --> 02:02:01.378]  What was he asked?
[02:02:02.118 --> 02:02:03.658]  Well, I've got it queued up.
[02:02:03.718 --> 02:02:11.321]  Essentially, he's asked, how come your members of your board don't oppose in the increases of the interest rates?
[02:02:11.701 --> 02:02:16.942]  And Bernanke actually comes up with an admission that the Bank of England is a member.
[02:02:17.422 --> 02:02:19.103]  And if you'd like it, I'll play it for you right now.
[02:02:19.798 --> 02:02:26.563]  Well, we can't play it right now because we're up against a break and we're a network, so it's all satellite-based and we've got to work exactly on time.
[02:02:26.924 --> 02:02:30.507]  When you come back, I'll let you recap that and play the clip if it sounds okay.
[02:02:30.847 --> 02:02:31.227]  Thank you.
[02:02:31.307 --> 02:02:35.410]  We'll be right back with David in San Francisco, then Ed in Pennsylvania, and many, many others.
[02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:42.736]  I'm trying to dig out the story I've got somewhere here in my stack, I believe I have it, about what's happening with inflation.
[02:02:43.096 --> 02:02:43.557]  Stay with us.
[02:02:48.582 --> 02:02:51.763]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.123 --> 02:02:54.023]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.423 --> 02:03:02.085]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.765 --> 02:03:09.806]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.207 --> 02:03:13.147]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.487 --> 02:03:15.848]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.268 --> 02:03:17.108]  NSA spies.
[02:03:18.537 --> 02:03:21.678]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:03:21.938 --> 02:03:25.418]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.919 --> 02:03:27.839]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.159 --> 02:03:32.080]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:39.601]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:03:45.521 --> 02:03:48.383]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:03:48.743 --> 02:03:51.624]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:51.844 --> 02:03:58.048]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:03:58.428 --> 02:04:05.732]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:04:05.912 --> 02:04:10.014]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[02:04:10.274 --> 02:04:15.817]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[02:04:16.017 --> 02:04:29.123]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[02:04:29.323 --> 02:04:37.947]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Food and Places USA now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:04:44.969 --> 02:04:47.150]  By now, it is no surprise that the U.S.
[02:04:47.210 --> 02:04:52.792]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:04:53.012 --> 02:04:57.854]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become nutritious.
[02:05:03.435 --> 02:05:05.938]  Everyone has the right to good health.
[02:05:06.258 --> 02:05:13.063]  Join the self-reliant families, entrepreneurs, and the company pioneering cutting-edge glyconutrient technology.
[02:05:13.243 --> 02:05:17.247]  The wellness revolution is projected to be a $1 trillion industry by 2010.
[02:05:18.468 --> 02:05:23.112]  We are looking for people who are serious about bettering their lives and the lives of the people they love.
[02:05:23.272 --> 02:05:24.673]  Better health is possible.
[02:05:24.793 --> 02:05:27.935]  To learn more, go to therighttogoodhealth.com.
[02:05:28.096 --> 02:05:30.958]  You have the right to decide what is attainable in your lifetime
[02:05:31.178 --> 02:05:32.699]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:32.719 --> 02:05:34.239]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:34.299 --> 02:05:36.200]  Coming up, I'll get into this AP headline.
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:37.100]  Economy slows sharply.
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:37.960]  Inflation heats up.
[02:05:57.356 --> 02:05:59.278]  Riot erupts in southwest China.
[02:05:59.318 --> 02:06:00.359]  We'll tell you why.
[02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:02.601]  Now it ties into what's happening here in the U.S.
[02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:07.967]  We're going to go to David, Ed, Jason, George, John, and others here in just a moment.
[02:06:08.387 --> 02:06:10.229]  Coming up tomorrow night, 8 p.m.
[02:06:10.309 --> 02:06:14.934]  Eastern, 7 o'clock Central, 6 o'clock Mountain, 5 o'clock Pacific.
[02:06:15.683 --> 02:06:26.152]  C-SPAN 1 is going to be airing American Perspectives in an hour and 15 minutes of our 9-11 symposium out in Los Angeles, California on the 24th and 25th of last month.
[02:06:26.172 --> 02:06:30.135]  They're finally airing it, probably thanks to the wonderful pressure you've put on them.
[02:06:30.415 --> 02:06:31.396]  So now we need to thank them.
[02:06:31.697 --> 02:06:34.119]  We'll see if they air it, though, but it's on their schedule.
[02:06:34.479 --> 02:06:39.323]  We have press releases on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com about this.
[02:06:39.803 --> 02:06:41.224]  Please email it to everybody.
[02:06:41.285 --> 02:06:42.686]  Post it on every message board.
[02:06:43.286 --> 02:06:44.928]  Get it out to everyone in your area.
[02:06:44.988 --> 02:06:47.029]  Call into radio talk shows and tell them.
[02:06:47.049 --> 02:06:52.554]  If you want to know the truth about 9-11, tune in tomorrow, 8 o'clock Eastern, on C-SPAN 1.
[02:06:52.594 --> 02:06:56.978]  Almost every cable system in the country, in fact, I think everyone does, has C-SPAN 1.
[02:06:57.018 --> 02:06:58.519]  It even goes with basic cable.
[02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.841]  They changed those regulations a few years ago.
[02:07:01.382 --> 02:07:03.043]  So it is just all over the place.
[02:07:03.203 --> 02:07:04.785]  Everybody who has cable in the U.S.
[02:07:05.165 --> 02:07:07.307]  or Dish Network is able to get this.
[02:07:07.427 --> 02:07:09.809]  But even if you don't have Dish Network or cable,
[02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:18.808]  You can go online to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com tomorrow and tune in to it via the internet.
[02:07:18.848 --> 02:07:21.993]  They have a video stream of it that we are linked to and we made it easy for you.
[02:07:22.033 --> 02:07:25.318]  It's kind of hard to find, so we posted it on the site.
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:28.123]  And then, of course, I'll be back Sunday.
[02:07:28.303 --> 02:07:29.665]  Hardworking guy on radio.
[02:07:29.705 --> 02:07:35.213]  New Sunday show I'm developing with MS Communications for syndication in the next few months.
[02:07:35.233 --> 02:07:38.197]  But you can listen via the web to KLBJ 590 from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:07:41.645 --> 02:07:42.906]  So much happening in the world.
[02:07:42.926 --> 02:07:44.467]  I'm going to be working now six days a week.
[02:07:44.887 --> 02:07:46.048]  I always did to begin with.
[02:07:46.068 --> 02:07:47.169]  I really work seven days a week.
[02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:50.131]  But it's a hard-hitting two hours with great guests and your calls.
[02:07:50.151 --> 02:07:51.371]  4 to 6 p.m.
[02:07:51.431 --> 02:07:52.092]  on KLBJ.
[02:07:52.132 --> 02:07:53.553]  You can tune in via the web as well.
[02:07:53.973 --> 02:07:57.676]  Now, David called from San Francisco for those that missed his call in the last segment.
[02:07:57.696 --> 02:08:07.382]  He brought up Edward Bernanke, the new Federal Reserve Chairman, who's called Mr. Helicopter, Helicopter Ben, because he said that he literally wants to drop money on populations from helicopters.
[02:08:07.862 --> 02:08:11.764]  That may sound good on the surface, but they've already doubled the money supply in the last six years.
[02:08:12.224 --> 02:08:13.665]  They've devalued the currency by 97%.
[02:08:13.905 --> 02:08:20.149]  A dollar's worth three cents on what it was just 100 years ago.
[02:08:20.489 --> 02:08:23.230]  And he's talking about doubling it in the next three years.
[02:08:24.531 --> 02:08:27.193]  And you've noticed the dollar's gone down in value massively.
[02:08:27.233 --> 02:08:31.115]  So this is a way to get rid of our, quote, national debt or abate it to some extent.
[02:08:31.335 --> 02:08:33.416]  But that's how Mexico and other countries do it, too.
[02:08:33.736 --> 02:08:37.218]  This is banana republic activity, and this is robbing you.
[02:08:37.905 --> 02:08:41.648]  So, David, you say you've got some clip of the Fed chief you want to play.
[02:08:41.808 --> 02:08:43.289]  Specifically, what are we about to hear?
[02:08:43.869 --> 02:08:47.351]  Okay, this is from the 19th of July.
[02:08:47.792 --> 02:08:50.193]  The Senate Banking Committee has Bernanke in there.
[02:08:50.493 --> 02:08:54.856]  And this is Senator Bunning of Kentucky.
[02:08:55.837 --> 02:08:58.899]  He's asking him a question about whether the Fed chairman...
[02:08:59.523 --> 02:09:08.452]  And various of the 13 chapters, so to speak, have any independent minds of their own, or do they all kind of mindlessly answer?
[02:09:08.792 --> 02:09:16.700]  And what the response from Bernanke is, is, well, we do have some independents, and for example, the Bank of England is one of our
[02:09:17.268 --> 02:09:23.249]  I'm one of our committees, and they decided not to approve the raise, even though the raise went through.
[02:09:23.529 --> 02:09:25.310]  So here comes Senator Bunning.
[02:09:25.350 --> 02:09:27.610]  This is global government being admitted in the open.
[02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:31.131]  Will you please burn me a copy or make me a copy of this tape and mail it to me?
[02:09:32.091 --> 02:09:37.072]  You know, I could probably burn a copy and put it on radio.indymedia.org.
[02:09:37.172 --> 02:09:37.952]  Yeah, let's see then.
[02:09:37.992 --> 02:09:40.673]  That wouldn't be usable for local television in Austin.
[02:09:41.213 --> 02:09:45.595]  Okay, well, either way... Will you blow up video like that unless you had an FTP sign or something?
[02:09:45.695 --> 02:09:48.176]  Well, you can get it.
[02:09:48.696 --> 02:09:54.698]  It's still on C-SPAN as an audio file or maybe a video file as well.
[02:09:54.778 --> 02:09:56.799]  Well, sir, do you have audio or video?
[02:09:57.559 --> 02:10:02.421]  I have a copy that came from CNBC.
[02:10:03.055 --> 02:10:05.036]  But I just checked C-SPAN.
[02:10:05.136 --> 02:10:07.137]  So you're saying I'm a pretty busy fellow.
[02:10:07.157 --> 02:10:08.878]  You're saying you won't do me the favor of mailing it to me.
[02:10:08.978 --> 02:10:09.979]  Well, I can see about it.
[02:10:10.519 --> 02:10:10.959]  You know what?
[02:10:10.999 --> 02:10:11.499]  Don't worry about it.
[02:10:11.519 --> 02:10:12.160]  It's too much trouble.
[02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:13.320]  Go ahead and play the clip for us.
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.141]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:10:16.262 --> 02:10:16.782]  Too much trouble.
[02:10:16.802 --> 02:10:17.963]  I don't get many of them from here.
[02:10:17.983 --> 02:10:18.503]  That's okay.
[02:10:21.505 --> 02:10:26.087]  Fed minutes say that there is a discussion of a range of options.
[02:10:26.867 --> 02:10:30.609]  But it turns out that the vote is almost always unanimous.
[02:10:31.150 --> 02:10:31.830]  I had to go back.
[02:10:32.665 --> 02:10:39.751]  I can't remember when the last dissenting vote in the FMOC committee occurred.
[02:10:40.732 --> 02:10:50.521]  Leading up to the June meeting, public statements by some of the Fed members indicated there might be a pause, but once again the vote was unanimous to raise rates.
[02:10:51.202 --> 02:10:58.008]  How much serious debate is there really if the Fed keeps coming up with unanimous decisions?
[02:10:59.673 --> 02:11:02.535]  Senator, different committees have different approaches to decision-making.
[02:11:02.595 --> 02:11:11.282]  The Monetary Policy Committee in the UK, for example, is a, like the Senate, is where everybody votes, you know, directly.
[02:11:11.302 --> 02:11:17.266]  And in recent occasion, the governor of the Bank of England was voted down in his recommendation.
[02:11:18.107 --> 02:11:20.629]  That would be a very pleasant surprise at times.
[02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:23.031]  You cut it, right?
[02:11:23.732 --> 02:11:24.834]  Yeah, will you turn it off for a second?
[02:11:25.114 --> 02:11:25.635]  Yeah.
[02:11:25.655 --> 02:11:26.756]  Listen, Dave, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:11:26.796 --> 02:11:28.298]  It's really hard for us to get stuff down.
[02:11:28.318 --> 02:11:29.219]  We're totally overwhelmed.
[02:11:29.259 --> 02:11:32.584]  I'm kind of shocked that you won't make me a copy of that and mail it to me.
[02:11:32.744 --> 02:11:35.668]  Yeah, and I just don't have the good technology like other people do.
[02:11:36.048 --> 02:11:38.611]  I was able to catch this off CNBC, and...
[02:11:39.454 --> 02:11:49.140]  You know, if I take it, I can take it down to our little pirate radio station, and it's kind of a four-stage process to make an audio clip.
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:50.061]  When did he testify?
[02:11:50.101 --> 02:11:50.681]  What's the date?
[02:11:50.881 --> 02:11:58.166]  It's the 19th, and again, this is Senator Bunning, B-U-N-N-I-N-G of Kentucky, and it's toward the end, if I understand right.
[02:11:58.546 --> 02:12:03.770]  I only caught about 20 minutes of this off CNBC, but it is still available.
[02:12:04.410 --> 02:12:05.571]  How long did he testify?
[02:12:06.291 --> 02:12:08.873]  I think it's listed on C-SPAN as two and a half hours.
[02:12:10.085 --> 02:12:10.926]  Here's the problem.
[02:12:13.368 --> 02:12:16.990]  I don't want to get into the backside of it, but sometimes they even refuse to send us stuff.
[02:12:17.671 --> 02:12:21.534]  But the other point to it is, yeah, I'm sure I can go find an audio file of it.
[02:12:21.554 --> 02:12:22.915]  I mean, I have an audio file of it now.
[02:12:23.335 --> 02:12:31.341]  I need the video file, and so if you're not going to use that, why don't you just mail me the original, and I'll even send you a free Terror Storm.
[02:12:31.381 --> 02:12:34.763]  Just put in there that I said I'd give you a Terror Storm, but mail that to me, okay?
[02:12:35.023 --> 02:12:35.964]  Okay, well, I'll tell you what.
[02:12:36.104 --> 02:12:38.506]  I'll see if I can find a friend that can DVD burn it.
[02:12:39.736 --> 02:12:43.218]  Okay, just make sure it's not screwed up or something.
[02:12:43.478 --> 02:12:44.278]  Yeah, well, we'll do.
[02:12:44.598 --> 02:12:45.719]  Okay, hey, man, thanks a lot.
[02:12:45.739 --> 02:12:46.459]  I appreciate that.
[02:12:47.319 --> 02:12:50.781]  I mean, nobody said this stuff was easy, but I need your help on stuff like this, folks.
[02:12:51.781 --> 02:12:57.184]  And so much, we don't have a huge research staff or the capital to do a lot of this.
[02:12:57.924 --> 02:13:01.866]  We need your help when you see stuff like this to market, to label it, and to send it to us.
[02:13:02.406 --> 02:13:03.366]  We really do need your help.
[02:13:03.386 --> 02:13:04.787]  We appreciate your help.
[02:13:05.327 --> 02:13:06.287]  Ed in Pennsylvania.
[02:13:06.307 --> 02:13:07.048]  Ed, you're on the air.
[02:13:07.088 --> 02:13:07.448]  Go ahead.
[02:13:08.562 --> 02:13:13.024]  Alex, have you been seeing these Capital One commercials with the barbarians?
[02:13:14.305 --> 02:13:15.305]  I saw those years ago.
[02:13:15.345 --> 02:13:19.667]  They're still running those where if you don't have the Capital One, these barbarians will come kill you?
[02:13:20.387 --> 02:13:20.747]  Oh, yes.
[02:13:20.968 --> 02:13:27.831]  And the latest one is they're running a summer camp, and they're sitting around with the little kids at a campfire singing a song.
[02:13:28.731 --> 02:13:31.532]  Burn the village to the ground, do da, do da.
[02:13:31.932 --> 02:13:33.333]  They're teaching the little kids that song.
[02:13:35.876 --> 02:13:37.918]  Well, there is a lot of propaganda in television.
[02:13:37.978 --> 02:13:45.284]  I mean, going back ten years, they had propaganda running on Lockheed commercials about how wonderful thumb scanning is, and then notice, magically, it's going into our driver's license now.
[02:13:46.144 --> 02:13:48.426]  Just burn the village to the ground.
[02:13:48.806 --> 02:13:49.547]  Doo-dah, doo-dah.
[02:13:49.667 --> 02:13:50.668]  Teach them little kids that.
[02:13:50.728 --> 02:13:55.352]  I mean, that's horrible, especially what's going on in... Well, it's funny.
[02:13:55.452 --> 02:14:03.298]  The Marine Corps, this was in mainstream news, what, four years ago, one of their main new chants that's authorized and used core-wide...
[02:14:04.622 --> 02:14:13.885]  I can't say it's too profane, but they talk about calling out the school children, giving them candy, and then mowing them down, which is what Joseph Mingle actually did for entertainment.
[02:14:15.145 --> 02:14:17.566]  Give them little chocolate bars and blow their heads off with a luger.
[02:14:18.326 --> 02:14:23.328]  But the Marines actually chant about killing children, and then they train them.
[02:14:23.348 --> 02:14:24.728]  Will you kill your parents of order?
[02:14:24.808 --> 02:14:25.368]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:25.868 --> 02:14:27.269]  And in the past, that wasn't done.
[02:14:27.309 --> 02:14:28.169]  That's a new thing.
[02:14:28.489 --> 02:14:29.689]  It's about killing Americans.
[02:14:29.729 --> 02:14:31.530]  They chant about killing the American people.
[02:14:32.677 --> 02:14:36.739]  I've been listening to the show for five years, Alex, and you're really coming a long way.
[02:14:37.059 --> 02:14:37.819]  It's fantastic.
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:39.440]  Oh, I've come a long way.
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:39.921]  Well, thank you.
[02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:41.201]  You know what I mean.
[02:14:41.361 --> 02:14:42.602]  It's just been getting better and better.
[02:14:42.622 --> 02:14:45.623]  We're right out on the forefront now.
[02:14:45.643 --> 02:14:46.744]  No, no, no.
[02:14:46.764 --> 02:14:47.464]  I appreciate that.
[02:14:47.504 --> 02:14:52.066]  I mean, I know the show has come a long way, and the country's come a long way, and all of us are learning together.
[02:14:52.086 --> 02:14:53.227]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:54.713 --> 02:15:00.678]  What's happened is, five, six years ago, I was so hyper, so much energy, that I was out of control, and I still am to a certain extent now.
[02:15:00.698 --> 02:15:06.524]  I don't want to say burned out, but I've kind of sawed off my edges in a lot of ways.
[02:15:06.544 --> 02:15:11.568]  Still got quite a few edges, though, but people seem to like me a little more subdued occasionally.
[02:15:11.608 --> 02:15:16.292]  But, you know, we really shouldn't be too subdued in hindsight of what's happening in this country.
[02:15:16.332 --> 02:15:16.913]  It's pretty bad.
[02:15:17.856 --> 02:15:18.737]  We should be upset.
[02:15:18.997 --> 02:15:23.621]  And the fact that we've lost the capacity to get upset shows why we're in the shape we're in.
[02:15:23.661 --> 02:15:25.182]  Let's talk to Jason in Maryland.
[02:15:25.222 --> 02:15:26.143]  Jason, you're on the air.
[02:15:26.223 --> 02:15:26.644]  Go ahead.
[02:15:27.204 --> 02:15:27.785]  Hi, Alex.
[02:15:29.026 --> 02:15:34.811]  I was watching a video by Tex Mars the other day about Roman Catholicism.
[02:15:34.871 --> 02:15:37.153]  And I was wondering, you don't speak a lot.
[02:15:37.633 --> 02:15:38.354]  Sometimes you do.
[02:15:38.414 --> 02:15:45.380]  But I was wondering if you could give me your views on both Wojtyla and Ratzinger.
[02:15:45.851 --> 02:15:47.031]  Wojtyla and Ratzinger.
[02:15:47.051 --> 02:15:49.392]  Well, I know who Ratzinger is.
[02:15:49.432 --> 02:15:52.053]  He's Benedict the... What is he?
[02:15:52.073 --> 02:15:53.713]  Benedict the... What's his number?
[02:15:53.793 --> 02:15:54.273]  I forget.
[02:15:54.553 --> 02:15:55.294]  I don't even know.
[02:15:56.094 --> 02:15:58.555]  Wojtyla was John Paul II.
[02:15:58.655 --> 02:15:59.555]  Yeah, sure.
[02:16:00.535 --> 02:16:01.235]  The Polish fellow.
[02:16:01.635 --> 02:16:02.636]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:02.816 --> 02:16:08.237]  I was wondering, could you give me your opinion on their position in the New World Order?
[02:16:08.617 --> 02:16:14.419]  I mean, when I saw the Pope having every religion in the world gathered at
[02:16:14.986 --> 02:16:18.127]  What's supposed to be, you know, Yahushua's pulpit.
[02:16:19.247 --> 02:16:23.789]  Snake charmers and... No, no, I mean, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:16:23.809 --> 02:16:26.290]  Let me comment on that before we get a break.
[02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:30.951]  There are hundreds of different sects of Christians and groups out there.
[02:16:31.231 --> 02:16:35.312]  And I have a lot of Catholic friends that are good friends of mine that are good people that do good works.
[02:16:35.452 --> 02:16:38.793]  But I see the Protestants totally taking over.
[02:16:38.853 --> 02:16:40.714]  I see the Catholics totally taking over.
[02:16:41.874 --> 02:16:42.695]  Pope Benedict...
[02:16:44.156 --> 02:16:45.137]  He's been the new guy.
[02:16:45.237 --> 02:16:47.798]  Ratzinger's been calling for a new world order every week or two.
[02:16:48.759 --> 02:16:51.740]  Pope John Paul II calling for a new world order.
[02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:53.621]  Yeah, saying all the religions were the same.
[02:16:53.701 --> 02:16:57.083]  Having hundreds of religions there at the St.
[02:16:57.123 --> 02:16:58.124]  Peter's Basilica.
[02:16:58.224 --> 02:16:59.184]  It's total blasphemy.
[02:16:59.204 --> 02:17:00.085]  It's totally evil.
[02:17:00.745 --> 02:17:05.628]  And any Catholic that looks and watches that and says that it isn't has got their head screwed on sideways.
[02:17:06.868 --> 02:17:09.550]  But at the same time, I don't get into what all the other shows do that
[02:17:10.228 --> 02:17:14.589]  Don't reach people is fight and fight and fight about all these sects and all these people.
[02:17:15.069 --> 02:17:25.851]  I just worship God and I love Jesus and I fight evil and I try to do good works and I try to have love in my heart and I try to have courage and I try to fight corruption.
[02:17:27.672 --> 02:17:29.552]  And do I think the Catholic Church runs everything?
[02:17:29.592 --> 02:17:30.212]  No, I don't.
[02:17:30.632 --> 02:17:32.532]  Do I think evil is running the Catholic Church right now?
[02:17:32.552 --> 02:17:32.633]  Yeah.
[02:17:32.733 --> 02:17:34.513]  It certainly is.
[02:17:36.133 --> 02:17:39.954]  And just like the Protestants can't see how evil our church has gotten, the Catholics can't either.
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:42.835]  I mean, it's just, it's Satan run.

[02:19:45.498 --> 02:19:48.960]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:52.762]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:19:52.842 --> 02:19:56.785]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:19:57.005 --> 02:20:03.168]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:03.568 --> 02:20:11.493]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:20:11.893 --> 02:20:17.234]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:20:17.394 --> 02:20:21.155]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:21.535 --> 02:20:23.376]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.

[02:20:39.780 --> 02:20:43.622]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:20:44.402 --> 02:20:48.464]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:48.665 --> 02:20:52.066]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:52.246 --> 02:20:55.688]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:55.979 --> 02:20:59.242]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:20:59.262 --> 02:21:04.726]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:21:04.766 --> 02:21:14.393]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:14.534 --> 02:21:15.815]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:21:15.835 --> 02:21:21.299]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[02:21:21.798 --> 02:21:26.282]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:26.302 --> 02:21:27.683]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:21:27.843 --> 02:21:31.727]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:21:31.767 --> 02:21:32.607]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:21:54.461 --> 02:21:59.584]  Let's move through some more of your calls, and then I'll get into a bunch of news I haven't even hit on yet.
[02:21:59.604 --> 02:22:02.425]  Believe me, we will take time to cover the news, so stay with us.
[02:22:03.066 --> 02:22:04.607]  John in New York, you're on the air.
[02:22:04.647 --> 02:22:05.007]  Welcome.
[02:22:06.268 --> 02:22:07.348]  Alex, how you doing, man?
[02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.789]  Good, sir.
[02:22:08.509 --> 02:22:10.631]  I just want to talk about Terror Storm, man.
[02:22:10.651 --> 02:22:14.113]  If people didn't see that, man, it's just amazing.
[02:22:14.213 --> 02:22:14.473]  It's just
[02:22:15.029 --> 02:22:20.671]  I mean, it just starts out with this hardcore bass line, man, and just gets even better.
[02:22:20.691 --> 02:22:22.051]  You've got the facts, man.
[02:22:22.071 --> 02:22:26.532]  You know, I just like to host your show, man, just to sit back, smoke a bong, man.
[02:22:27.933 --> 02:22:28.473]  Well, thank you.
[02:22:29.013 --> 02:22:29.934]  I appreciate your call.
[02:22:29.954 --> 02:22:35.955]  You sound like a great caller, John, but there's a 50% chance it's got prank involved in it, so I'm going to let you go.
[02:22:36.516 --> 02:22:38.416]  But thank you so much, John.
[02:22:38.436 --> 02:22:39.536]  That's great.
[02:22:40.117 --> 02:22:41.237]  Gio in New York.
[02:22:41.277 --> 02:22:42.377]  You're on the air, Gio.
[02:22:42.717 --> 02:22:43.738]  Hey, big fan here.
[02:22:45.217 --> 02:22:47.960]  Alex, but I'm a little bit disturbed with you.
[02:22:47.980 --> 02:23:03.034]  I know you're one of these guys that doesn't attack anyone, but I really think you need to address David Ray Griffin's pro-globalization writings and his pagan, satanic kind of New World religion.
[02:23:03.706 --> 02:23:05.447]  Well, I've heard he's written some new-worldly things.
[02:23:05.507 --> 02:23:06.587]  I haven't read what he's written.
[02:23:06.647 --> 02:23:12.429]  All I know is he's gone on C-SPAN and laid out scholarly dissertations on 9-11 being an inside job, and it's woken up a lot of people.
[02:23:12.909 --> 02:23:16.950]  And when he was last on as a guest, it was brought up by multiple callers.
[02:23:17.231 --> 02:23:26.594]  And so, I mean, I do attack globalists, and I know that's why Griffin has been so respected, because he's been involved with people in the CFR and his high level.
[02:23:27.694 --> 02:23:33.096]  Sir, have you looked at Kevin Barrett's writings on planetization, Islamic planetization?
[02:23:33.664 --> 02:23:34.265]  No, I haven't.
[02:23:35.565 --> 02:23:37.487]  I hope you do, and that's all I have to suggest.
[02:23:37.527 --> 02:23:37.867]  Thank you.
[02:23:38.167 --> 02:23:38.708]  Well, thank you.
[02:23:38.848 --> 02:23:41.469]  Do you want to add some more, Gio?
[02:23:42.270 --> 02:23:44.071]  I mean, this is real criticism right now.
[02:23:44.111 --> 02:23:44.732]  I appreciate this.
[02:23:44.772 --> 02:23:45.152]  Go ahead.
[02:23:45.672 --> 02:23:46.153]  Anything else?
[02:23:46.913 --> 02:23:54.939]  You know, I would just say that there appears to be some sort of co-option of the leadership of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:23:55.699 --> 02:23:58.541]  I don't include yourself in that, but there's a lot of links between
[02:23:59.096 --> 02:24:12.345]  Between the Ford Foundation and Hewlett and another bunch of foundations that are supporting people like Griffin and Ahmed in London, who, by the way, support Sharia law.
[02:24:13.765 --> 02:24:25.213]  And, you know, it's just disturbing because it seems like we're being manipulated into a direction that's actually anti-American and giving aid and comfort to those people that want to destroy the United States.
[02:24:25.353 --> 02:24:26.954]  How long have you been listening to this show?
[02:24:27.935 --> 02:24:28.475]  A long time.
[02:24:29.099 --> 02:24:37.302]  Did you hear me on the day of 9-11 and then six months in and a year in say that the globalists may allow 9-11 to come out to then blame the U.S.
[02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:43.204]  and England as if we are the only New World Order system and then make the U.N.-style U.N.
[02:24:43.224 --> 02:24:46.185]  look like the savior and that we had to guard against that?
[02:24:46.505 --> 02:24:48.405]  I don't know if you've heard me say that in the past.
[02:24:48.845 --> 02:24:51.986]  I've heard you say that, and I'm trying to add support to that.
[02:24:53.647 --> 02:24:54.887]  Who was the next name you gave?
[02:24:54.907 --> 02:24:56.048]  You only gave the last name.
[02:24:56.068 --> 02:24:56.808]  Who were you talking about?
[02:24:57.467 --> 02:25:00.308]  There's an Islamic guy that Barrett praises.
[02:25:00.348 --> 02:25:02.548]  He's a 9-11 researcher based out of London.
[02:25:02.608 --> 02:25:04.248]  I believe I've interviewed him once before.
[02:25:04.308 --> 02:25:07.269]  He based his first book on a lot of my work.
[02:25:07.329 --> 02:25:09.629]  I'm even footnoted there, and I believe he's set up next week.
[02:25:09.829 --> 02:25:10.449]  Afiz Ahmed?
[02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:13.670]  Masad Ahmed.
[02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:14.970]  I don't have that on my favorites.
[02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.930]  I don't think that's it, then.
[02:25:15.970 --> 02:25:17.610]  Well, send me your specifics on him.
[02:25:18.211 --> 02:25:21.411]  And Griffin, look, here's the problem, and I appreciate your call.
[02:25:22.891 --> 02:25:26.612]  You know, I get criticism like, why hasn't Alex promoted freedom to fascism?
[02:25:27.304 --> 02:25:33.647]  Well, I did promote it two months ago, and then when Aaron Russo was here in town, he was too busy to come in studio and do an in-studio interview, and then I just had him on.
[02:25:34.227 --> 02:25:35.207]  So then I kind of feel bad.
[02:25:35.227 --> 02:25:37.448]  Sometimes people go, well, you haven't promoted everybody you should.
[02:25:37.468 --> 02:25:38.189]  I try to.
[02:25:38.329 --> 02:25:39.269]  I don't know everything.
[02:25:39.929 --> 02:25:42.971]  It's like people also think that I'm omnipresent.
[02:25:43.831 --> 02:25:45.171]  I mean, I do a lot of research.
[02:25:45.291 --> 02:25:47.412]  I'm on more of the cutting edge than most people.
[02:25:48.033 --> 02:25:50.053]  I mean, I know I work harder than anybody in this movement.
[02:25:50.153 --> 02:25:51.314]  I mean, there's no debating it.
[02:25:52.074 --> 02:25:57.117]  I mean, it's not hype when I say, for the last eight, nine months, I was working 16, 17 hours a day.
[02:25:57.177 --> 02:25:58.738]  Some days, 20 hours.
[02:25:59.698 --> 02:26:06.082]  Some days, I'd brush my teeth at 3 a.m., and I'd get up at 7 a.m.
[02:26:07.343 --> 02:26:08.003]  A lot of days.
[02:26:10.345 --> 02:26:14.487]  Boy, now I've kind of come down off of that, and I'm just working about 10 hours a day, and that's when it hits you afterwards.
[02:26:14.527 --> 02:26:15.468]  I'm just exhausted.
[02:26:17.289 --> 02:26:18.950]  I look like I'm about 50 years old.
[02:26:19.310 --> 02:26:20.571]  I'm 32, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:22.338 --> 02:26:24.079]  But then at the same time, I'll have some guests on.
[02:26:24.139 --> 02:26:24.840]  I get all these emails.
[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:28.403]  Did you know your guest once said this five years ago or that?
[02:26:28.423 --> 02:26:32.986]  Another thing is, we have to realize that some people are probably bad, are wolves in sheep's clothing.
[02:26:33.586 --> 02:26:38.170]  Other people are members of the establishment who we don't totally agree with, but that have come over to our side.
[02:26:41.252 --> 02:26:44.475]  That are waking up to what's happening.
[02:26:44.515 --> 02:26:46.216]  That are realizing what's going on.
[02:26:46.236 --> 02:26:48.938]  And we have to be ready to see that as a good thing.
[02:26:50.099 --> 02:26:51.540]  But I cannot...
[02:26:52.628 --> 02:26:54.289]  You know, know everything that everybody's written.
[02:26:54.329 --> 02:26:55.329]  I mean, look.
[02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:56.170]  Here's an example.
[02:26:56.490 --> 02:26:57.370]  Professor Jim Fetcher.
[02:26:58.651 --> 02:27:01.793]  He loves Al Gore and he thinks global warming is real and all the rest of it.
[02:27:01.873 --> 02:27:04.134]  And obviously, I know that's bad and that's not true.
[02:27:04.174 --> 02:27:05.615]  But he's right on 9-11.
[02:27:05.635 --> 02:27:06.595]  And I know he's a good guy.
[02:27:06.615 --> 02:27:07.496]  I know him personally.
[02:27:07.536 --> 02:27:13.279]  And these guys aren't going to come over to our side, the anti-New World Order side, completely overnight.
[02:27:13.719 --> 02:27:15.340]  But clearly, we are recruiting them.
[02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:16.400]  They're not recruiting us.
[02:27:17.341 --> 02:27:18.901]  Clearly, we're deprogramming them.
[02:27:18.941 --> 02:27:20.082]  They're not programming us.
[02:27:21.223 --> 02:27:21.363]  And...
[02:27:22.421 --> 02:27:23.302]  We're going to win this thing.
[02:27:23.923 --> 02:27:25.004]  We are going to win this thing.
[02:27:26.305 --> 02:27:26.746]  I know that.
[02:27:27.086 --> 02:27:27.967]  And I'm ready for victory.
[02:27:28.007 --> 02:27:28.488]  What about you?
[02:27:28.508 --> 02:27:31.271]  All right, we'll be right back with more calls and more news.
[02:27:31.291 --> 02:27:31.631]  Stay with me.
[02:27:36.076 --> 02:27:36.977]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.458 --> 02:27:39.060]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.001 --> 02:27:42.684]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:52.562]  In December 2005, CNN had a special documentary about the inevitability of nuclear terrorism on American soil.
[02:27:52.842 --> 02:27:58.404]  When the mainstream media is reporting on such a perilous topic with such candor, it should be taken very seriously.
[02:27:58.724 --> 02:28:05.286]  Currently for sale by owner, the ultimate secure home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[02:28:05.506 --> 02:28:10.307]  This patented steel-reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural
[02:28:10.547 --> 02:28:12.348]  Or man-made disaster you can name.
[02:28:12.548 --> 02:28:21.592]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[02:28:21.832 --> 02:28:25.313]  It even has a hidden fallout shelter with NBC air filtration.
[02:28:25.613 --> 02:28:29.095]  Its many self-sufficient and high-security features will amaze you.
[02:28:29.415 --> 02:28:36.678]  With nuclear World War III looming ever closer on the horizon, this custom survival home is turnkey, ready for a new owner.
[02:28:37.019 --> 02:28:40.768]  For more information, visit www.UltimateSecureHome.com
[02:28:45.911 --> 02:28:47.872]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:28:47.952 --> 02:28:48.613]  Hello, folks.
[02:28:48.753 --> 02:28:58.679]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:03.582]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.642 --> 02:29:14.970]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.570 --> 02:29:22.415]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.795 --> 02:29:24.936]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.437 --> 02:29:30.400]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:41.267]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:29:41.507 --> 02:29:42.308]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:51.934]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[02:29:52.154 --> 02:29:54.636]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[02:29:54.796 --> 02:29:57.418]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[02:29:57.578 --> 02:30:01.280]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[02:30:01.401 --> 02:30:06.504]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[02:30:06.684 --> 02:30:09.906]  You and your family will breathe better, sleep sounder, and have more energy.
[02:30:10.086 --> 02:30:14.368]  Natural salt lamps are available in stunning natural colors and shapes to accent any decor.
[02:30:14.448 --> 02:30:17.370]  The lamps are environmentally friendly, and most important, they're affordable.
[02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:21.332]  Natural salt lamps come with a 100% 60-day satisfaction guarantee.

[02:30:25.355 --> 02:30:31.558]  That's natural-salt-lamps.com to see the lamps for yourself and experience even more of the wellness tools available.
[02:30:31.678 --> 02:30:34.880]  Breathe easier, feel better, live healthier with a natural salt lamp.
[02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:35.861]  They railed against the crown!
[02:30:54.472 --> 02:30:57.818]  Another ragtag band declaring independence.
[02:30:57.879 --> 02:30:59.842]  They lay their bodies down.
[02:31:09.447 --> 02:31:10.668]  In a bloody war.
[02:31:12.570 --> 02:31:13.110]  For liberty.
[02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:14.511]  For their descendants.
[02:31:15.291 --> 02:31:17.333]  That's us.
[02:31:17.913 --> 02:31:19.815]  That's you.
[02:31:19.855 --> 02:31:26.659]  That's I. Alright, I'm going to go back to your calls here in a few minutes.
[02:31:26.679 --> 02:31:27.820]  But let me get into news now.
[02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:29.581]  Some of the other news we haven't covered as promised.
[02:31:29.601 --> 02:31:33.124]  This is out of the Associated Press today.
[02:31:34.449 --> 02:31:36.270]  Economy slows sharply.
[02:31:36.370 --> 02:31:37.851]  Inflation heats up.
[02:31:38.772 --> 02:31:49.279]  The economy's growth slowed sharply in the second quarter, logging just 2.5% pace as consumers tightened their belts and spending on home building died.
[02:31:49.679 --> 02:31:51.220]  Inflation, however, shot up.
[02:31:51.966 --> 02:31:52.326]  Thank you.
[02:31:52.366 --> 02:31:52.866]  Thank you.
[02:32:10.034 --> 02:32:10.514]  We're good to go.
[02:32:10.574 --> 02:32:10.835]  I think?
[02:32:35.547 --> 02:32:43.431]  ...at a 1.8% growth rate in the final quarter of 2005 when the economy was suffering fallout from the devastating Gulf Coast hurricanes.
[02:32:44.051 --> 02:32:47.873]  Even though the economy cooled, in the second quarter inflation heated up.
[02:32:48.313 --> 02:33:04.220]  An inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve showed that core prices, excluding food and energy, jumped to 2.9% in the second quarter, far outside the Fed's comfort zone, that was up from 2.1% increase in the first quarter and marked the highest inflation reading...
[02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:07.962]  Since the third quarter of 94, when core inflation rose by 2.3.2%.
[02:33:08.363 --> 02:33:15.347]  Now, it goes into oil at 77.3 a barrel, on and on.
[02:33:16.988 --> 02:33:17.889]  Let's just stop right there.
[02:33:18.889 --> 02:33:19.170]  Okay?
[02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:27.595]  You don't have to be an economist to know what's going on, though we've interviewed some of the most prestigious economists in the world and routinely every day read their writings.
[02:33:29.096 --> 02:33:33.319]  You have the real economists and the real economic papers that the elites...
[02:33:34.173 --> 02:33:41.475]  The big brokerage funds, the hedge funds, the central banks, the people with the real money that control it read every day.
[02:33:41.695 --> 02:33:42.395]  And those are public.
[02:33:43.155 --> 02:33:48.556]  Then you have the stuff the general public is fed, and occasionally truths like we just saw in the Associated Press.
[02:33:50.897 --> 02:33:57.719]  The basis of what is taught in the universities today, what is pushed is real economic policy and economic terms.
[02:33:57.759 --> 02:34:03.500]  The very nomenclature or dictionary, the thesaurus we use
[02:34:04.833 --> 02:34:05.473]  He's a fraud.
[02:34:06.814 --> 02:34:13.316]  Okay, we've had wild inflation in this country for 80 plus years since the Federal Reserve came in.
[02:34:14.957 --> 02:34:18.839]  We've seen a 97% devaluation in the value of the dollar.
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:32.064]  And that has been hidden post-World War II by the dollar being the World Reserve currency tagged to the price of crude oil and then petrol.
[02:34:33.164 --> 02:34:34.345]  Gasoline that you put in your car.
[02:34:35.106 --> 02:34:36.206]  Or that runs power plants.
[02:34:38.427 --> 02:34:39.988]  That runs the electricity in your home.
[02:34:40.668 --> 02:34:42.009]  Runs the factories of this country.
[02:34:44.049 --> 02:34:46.830]  And eggs may be the same price they were ten years ago.
[02:34:47.451 --> 02:34:49.711]  And milk may be the same price it was ten years ago.
[02:34:49.731 --> 02:34:53.693]  And there's a few staples they keep down through consolidation.
[02:34:53.973 --> 02:34:57.134]  And you can still buy $30 DVD players made by slaves in China.
[02:34:57.694 --> 02:35:04.837]  But housing, transportation, energy, education, medical care,
[02:35:06.306 --> 02:35:12.090]  The inflation is several thousand points, depending on which index you look at in the last 20 years alone.
[02:35:12.531 --> 02:35:16.814]  And if you look at the graph, it's several thousand points between 1,500 and 3,000.
[02:35:16.854 --> 02:35:21.097]  Depending on what gauge you look at, it's hard to tell, but we know it's way up.
[02:35:21.377 --> 02:35:25.140]  There's so many different weird numbers and government manipulation of statistics.
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:26.581]  But if you look at the hard numbers, it's bad.
[02:35:27.281 --> 02:35:31.445]  And now it's ramping up in the last 20 years, but now, for a while it was going up gradually.
[02:35:31.465 --> 02:35:32.946]  Now it's shooting up like a rocket.
[02:35:32.966 --> 02:35:34.647]  It's like a plane that took off
[02:35:35.273 --> 02:35:35.934]  We're good to go.
[02:35:57.378 --> 02:36:00.141]  And they've given us some tiny tax cuts, which are an illusion.
[02:36:00.301 --> 02:36:06.087]  The real tax comes from the value of your dollar, and then hence everything going up in price.
[02:36:06.107 --> 02:36:12.433]  And I don't know how you explain to some yuppie that, hey, you don't want an 8% tax cut from George Bush.
[02:36:12.834 --> 02:36:20.642]  What you want is your dollar to stay the same or get better in value, or at least slowly slide, not plunge downward into the abyss.
[02:36:23.746 --> 02:36:25.107]  And it's all been done by design.
[02:36:25.307 --> 02:36:40.733]  These foreign banks, you heard the clip earlier, and it's true, the Bank of Germany, the Bank of England, the Bank of the Netherlands, the Bank of France, the Japanese central banks, they're all owned by a few private families, Federal Reserves owned by about eight different families, the dominant stock in it.
[02:36:41.323 --> 02:37:00.080]  Imagine, they came in, paid off the politicians, 1913, set up their own banks, called it federal, and then private families started literally ordering the currency supply to go up or down and literally loan money themselves at 0% interest and then charge us interest and lend out $10 for every dollar they have in a bank.
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:01.882]  It's just a total fraud!
[02:37:02.862 --> 02:37:11.385]  And it is a vortex, a black hole, a Ponzi scheme designed to create booms and busts which the average person cannot escape.
[02:37:11.405 --> 02:37:19.328]  That is, some people can be so crafty in everyday business or have such a good product that you end up becoming wealthy or middle class or surviving comfortably whatever you're shooting for.
[02:37:20.507 --> 02:37:30.074]  But on average, it is a predatory economy where we have higher levels of debt than they did in the depths of the Depression in late 1933.
[02:37:30.314 --> 02:37:37.920]  The highest debt ratio ever in the United States in our 230 years in one month or whatever it is.
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:38.860]  Less than a month.
[02:37:39.601 --> 02:37:40.361]  Let's be technical.
[02:37:40.381 --> 02:37:41.262]  230 years in 24 days.
[02:37:41.282 --> 02:37:41.362]  Okay.
[02:37:41.382 --> 02:37:41.422]  So...
[02:37:49.853 --> 02:37:50.374]  It's bad.
[02:37:50.434 --> 02:37:51.074]  It's scary.
[02:37:53.396 --> 02:38:00.303]  And the New World Order will not allow this economic collapse to happen unless they can stage it and pose as our saviors and blame it on somebody else in the process.
[02:38:00.803 --> 02:38:06.568]  And a lot of times when they think there's going to be an economic collapse, they will stage a war or stage a terror attack to kind of smoke screen it.
[02:38:06.849 --> 02:38:12.154]  To kind of, oh, well, the stock market plunged because Al-Qaeda hit us when the stock market was really plunging in the week before 9-11.
[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:43.182]  So they may just have the military forces over there and be telling us terrorists are going to hit us any minute here domestically and we're going to have to have World War III because if this global system does collapse, because bankers are openly saying they may not be able to control it, central bankers are, then they can just pop off a nuke or release nerve gas or release smallpox or bird flu or chicken little flu or whatever it's going to be and use that kind of as the emotional salve to direct all of our anger and energy off of going into a depression onto that.
[02:38:45.717 --> 02:38:47.079]  And I'm not trying to fearmonger.
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:53.026]  This Ponzi scheme may go on for another five years, another 20, but I doubt it.
[02:38:55.529 --> 02:38:57.652]  When the Times of London is saying we may have a...
[02:38:58.630 --> 02:39:07.837]  Worldwide depression, or we're going to have one, and the question is, will the elite be able to position themselves to protect themselves and come out winning in this, or will they come out losing?
[02:39:07.857 --> 02:39:12.240]  See, for the first time in modern history, real elites are openly talking about losing their shirts.
[02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:23.028]  They've gotten so greedy, they've been so competitive with each other in the hedge funds, in the stock markets, and in the bonds, and in the real estate, that they're all leveraged, competing with each other.
[02:39:23.088 --> 02:39:23.468]  It's nuts.
[02:39:26.064 --> 02:39:28.706]  This is the same elite that's using depleted uranium worldwide.
[02:39:28.726 --> 02:39:38.293]  The same elite putting mercury in vaccines and letting hundreds of thousands of people in the West get AIDS and hepatitis C, knowingly putting it in the factor VIII.
[02:39:38.313 --> 02:39:40.874]  I mean, these people, they dump nerve gas in the ocean.
[02:39:40.894 --> 02:39:42.936]  They throw nuclear reactors in lakes.
[02:39:42.996 --> 02:39:44.117]  I mean, they're just crazy.
[02:39:45.738 --> 02:39:51.922]  The elites of old were at least more controlled and weren't as aggressive in everything they were doing.
[02:39:52.899 --> 02:39:53.240]  We're good to go.
[02:39:53.260 --> 02:39:53.580]  I think?
[02:40:13.544 --> 02:40:14.244]  We're good to go.
[02:40:29.364 --> 02:40:38.409]  And the New World Order's answer is warfare, some type of unifying effect through these crises that they've engineered, but now that they're so bad, it may even implode on them.
[02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:40.991]  Iraq's a perfect microcosm example.
[02:40:41.451 --> 02:40:47.695]  We've got 1983 Israeli documents, 1990 neocon documents, 1996 neocon documents, Pentagon documents.
[02:40:48.979 --> 02:40:51.640]  Where they say we're going to break Iraq in three pieces, send the U.S.
[02:40:51.660 --> 02:41:01.606]  military in, and then invade Lebanon and do all of this and take over the whole Middle East, and we want civil war and sectarian strife and to play the different parties off against each other in every sector.
[02:41:03.046 --> 02:41:08.889]  But now they've done such a good job of that that it's imploding so badly in Iraq, we may physically get kicked out of there.
[02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:15.693]  And we're now totally bivouacked, hiding out in our armored citadels that are only there to ensure that the
[02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:19.922]  Chaos continues, and we have open public Pentagon documents.
[02:41:19.942 --> 02:41:26.664]  They're implementing it, and still the American people, still the left, can't even figure out that that's what this war is about.
[02:41:26.744 --> 02:41:29.085]  It's, oh, look what a bad job George Bush has done.
[02:41:29.426 --> 02:41:30.566]  No, he's done an excellent job.
[02:41:32.427 --> 02:41:33.247]  It's like the drug war.
[02:41:33.587 --> 02:41:35.128]  Oh, the government's done a horrible job.
[02:41:35.168 --> 02:41:43.732]  There's triple the heroin, double the cocaine, more people in prison every year, crime at the same level it was 20 years ago, not going down...
[02:41:45.462 --> 02:41:46.623]  Robberies and stuff are up.
[02:41:46.683 --> 02:41:51.106]  Actual violent crime is a little bit down, but it all averages together to plain at a very high level.
[02:41:52.287 --> 02:42:01.914]  No, the drug war is a fabulous, rip-roaring, insane success, flying colors, three-ring circus success.
[02:42:02.935 --> 02:42:12.422]  Government and banks ship it in, control it, arrest people, put them in private prisons that they built and control and own, building products at 20 cents an hour, displacing American workers.
[02:42:15.018 --> 02:42:20.040]  An excuse to bust in everybody's house and look for the drugs the government shipped in.
[02:42:20.100 --> 02:42:22.560]  I mean, what a sick joke.
[02:42:25.401 --> 02:42:30.803]  So I tell the young people, no matter how hard they push it on you or how Hollywood promotes it or how much you see it, don't use drugs.
[02:42:30.883 --> 02:42:31.563]  It's not cool.
[02:42:32.083 --> 02:42:32.904]  It is destructive.
[02:42:32.924 --> 02:42:33.584]  It is bad.
[02:42:33.844 --> 02:42:37.145]  And it's only meant to get you in a prison system working for the drug cartels.
[02:42:37.225 --> 02:42:37.525]  Okay?
[02:42:40.325 --> 02:42:45.026]  When you hear about a drug cartel getting busted, that's some cowboy that wasn't paying their cut.
[02:42:45.046 --> 02:42:49.188]  Or somebody that didn't play ball.
[02:42:51.248 --> 02:42:51.568]  Okay?
[02:42:52.869 --> 02:42:55.229]  I digress in the economy off into the drug war.
[02:42:55.289 --> 02:42:58.971]  It's just that we have totally ruthless scum running things.
[02:42:58.991 --> 02:42:59.991]  That's why they're in power.
[02:43:01.051 --> 02:43:06.953]  When you don't have an active, involved, good, well-meaning, patriotic, loving, strong...
[02:43:08.075 --> 02:43:27.982]  Moral population, you get a tyranny, and then by its very nature, a tyranny then gets worse and worse, because more and more evil people move into government to capitalize on the Trump, and then it's a big battle to the strongest and most wicked of who gets to sit on top of a pile of skulls, and you get the system we're in right now.
[02:43:28.002 --> 02:43:29.783]  A race to the bottom.
[02:43:31.778 --> 02:43:34.340]  The New World Order doesn't want you to have a nice house and a pool.
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.682]  They don't want you to have two cars and go on vacation and put your kids through college.
[02:43:39.003 --> 02:43:41.184]  They don't want you to be independent and happy.
[02:43:43.826 --> 02:43:45.747]  You know, I covered this earlier, Washington Post.
[02:43:46.542 --> 02:43:56.769]  Today, and we reposted some of the London Guardian and Times and other articles about it, they're going to try to force you to take a vaccine that attacks your brain and openly with viruses.
[02:43:57.289 --> 02:44:11.259]  Yes, they're going to inject you with viruses that cause an autoimmune response in the receptor sites of the neurons of the brain to actually create, quote, plaques in the brain tissue so you cannot be happy.
[02:44:13.721 --> 02:44:15.802]  What do you think narcotics imitate?
[02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:23.583]  They imitate what is normally in the brain when your body rewards you, when your brain rewards you.
[02:44:26.065 --> 02:44:27.505]  I mean, that's how bad it's gotten.
[02:44:27.525 --> 02:44:33.949]  They're proposing making everyone in England take a shot to where you won't want heroin, cocaine, or nicotine anymore.
[02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:39.032]  By the way, they even said in the Washington Post, or as much food, yeah.
[02:44:39.872 --> 02:44:41.593]  The same stuff that drives those desires.
[02:44:42.234 --> 02:44:44.135]  Folks, that's the nature of humanity.
[02:44:45.828 --> 02:44:47.133]  You're meant to feel good.
[02:44:47.373 --> 02:44:48.758]  You just don't need the drugs to do it.
[02:44:51.025 --> 02:44:52.128]  I feel good right now
[02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:59.233]  The problem is I'm all strung out on adrenaline and endorphins on the real thing.
[02:44:59.333 --> 02:45:02.254]  I am an actual drug addict for what's produced in my brain.
[02:45:02.675 --> 02:45:05.256]  And by the way, that's what the New World Order is targeting.
[02:45:05.737 --> 02:45:06.597]  They are upset.
[02:45:06.958 --> 02:45:08.679]  What do you think mercury is in the vaccines for?
[02:45:08.719 --> 02:45:19.766]  Because it attacks the cerebral cortex and gives the average individual who has received the round of 30 plus shots by the age of 18 months an average of a 20 point IQ reduction.
[02:45:21.829 --> 02:45:22.889]  Just like in Brave New World.
[02:45:22.909 --> 02:45:23.710]  Remember Aldous Huxley?
[02:45:24.050 --> 02:45:29.772]  Right before he died two months before at Berkeley, California in 62, gave a speech saying, Hey, my brother ran the UN UNESCO.
[02:45:29.812 --> 02:45:30.653]  Hey, this is eugenics.
[02:45:30.953 --> 02:45:31.573]  This is real.
[02:45:31.633 --> 02:45:33.314]  This book is about what we're really going to do to you.
[02:45:33.654 --> 02:45:34.514]  I'm here to warn you.
[02:45:34.554 --> 02:45:35.235]  This is real.
[02:45:35.575 --> 02:45:44.239]  We already have people in London laboratories I've been at, mentally ill patients who have wires in their heads with circuitry controlling them.
[02:45:44.259 --> 02:45:44.239]  62.
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:49.621]  Right before he died when he knew he was dying.
[02:45:51.767 --> 02:46:00.333]  And in that book, they take the embryos and they x-ray them to brain damage them so that they don't ask questions.
[02:46:01.014 --> 02:46:08.259]  Every few months I see a report in a major city where a cop files a suit, a cadet, because they've got over 100 IQ and no one above 100 IQ is allowed.
[02:46:08.359 --> 02:46:09.420]  Why do you think that is?
[02:46:11.901 --> 02:46:19.607]  Because someone with over 100 IQ, which is over average intelligence, is more statistically apt to question and to see through propaganda.
[02:46:22.350 --> 02:46:35.356]  And so rather than elites throughout history selecting kind of the mind-numb, squarehead type to serve them, they are now simply going directly to the babies and brain-damaging your babies at point-blank range.
[02:46:36.216 --> 02:46:45.880]  And now they're going to do it openly to all of us, forcibly, to the New Freedom Initiative and other initiatives with vaccines.
[02:46:46.020 --> 02:46:47.341]  That's not even the right name.
[02:46:47.661 --> 02:46:50.462]  With brain-damaging viral attacks.
[02:46:54.847 --> 02:46:55.668]  Washington Post.
[02:46:57.729 --> 02:47:03.812]  And they're selling it like it's the next best thing to slice bread and a wonderful thing.
[02:47:04.473 --> 02:47:07.274]  They're selling it like it's a walk in the park.
[02:47:07.674 --> 02:47:09.235]  They're selling it like it's a piece of cake.
[02:47:09.716 --> 02:47:12.377]  They're selling it like it's all sunshine and giggles.
[02:47:12.817 --> 02:47:13.658]  And folks, it isn't.
[02:47:13.998 --> 02:47:23.844]  These brain-altering, brain-chemistry, permanent brain-wrecking drugs and viral attack, pathogenic bio-attacks...
[02:47:24.602 --> 02:47:30.468]  Packaged as vaccines are the next big wave, and they're talking about engineering it into food, where you can't escape it.
[02:47:30.888 --> 02:47:35.252]  They're talking about putting it in the water, and then you question whether they already put stuff in the water.
[02:47:35.973 --> 02:47:39.816]  There's other reasons people aren't waking up and fighting back at the levels they should right now.
[02:47:41.758 --> 02:47:49.866]  You see, this is prima facie, caught red-handed evidence that they're trying to alter your brains and trying to make it mandatory.
[02:47:51.474 --> 02:47:56.055]  And you're going to hear it all over radio and TV in the next five years how you've got to give your kids these shots.
[02:47:56.675 --> 02:47:57.835]  Now getting approved right now.
[02:47:59.015 --> 02:48:01.476]  And they're going to come with SWAT teams within five or ten years.
[02:48:02.396 --> 02:48:04.316]  Armored vehicles to give you these shots.
[02:48:05.637 --> 02:48:07.237]  Then you won't feel as bad anymore, will you?
[02:48:08.237 --> 02:48:15.939]  Then you won't... Folks, you think I'm joking, but this is the power of the broadcast and what I see and what I know.
[02:48:17.019 --> 02:48:18.179]  What I have going for me.
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:26.462]  Is that I know what they're doing, and you're not going to believe me now, but when they come for you with those injections, I want you to remember.
[02:48:27.522 --> 02:48:31.803]  I want you to remember what I told you and what I warned you about.
[02:48:31.823 --> 02:48:41.044]  I want you to realize the metamoniacal evil we're facing so we can defeat these creatures and bring them down.
[02:48:41.705 --> 02:48:43.125]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:48.755 --> 02:48:51.916]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.256 --> 02:48:54.217]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.577 --> 02:49:02.240]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:09.963]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.363 --> 02:49:12.444]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took place.
[02:49:12.864 --> 02:49:15.185]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:15.605 --> 02:49:16.545]  NSA spying.
[02:49:16.926 --> 02:49:18.026]  Secret police torture.
[02:49:18.325 --> 02:49:21.006]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[02:49:21.267 --> 02:49:24.749]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.249 --> 02:49:27.150]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:31.412]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.796 --> 02:49:48.697]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:48.917 --> 02:49:54.358]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:54.638 --> 02:50:04.981]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:09.502]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:09.702 --> 02:50:18.045]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:50:18.325 --> 02:50:24.688]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[02:50:24.788 --> 02:50:29.269]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:29.489 --> 02:50:33.711]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:50:33.971 --> 02:50:38.393]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:50:39.053 --> 02:50:39.273]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:51:01.488 --> 02:51:02.089]  I think so.
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:17.400]  We're good to go.
[02:51:47.674 --> 02:51:48.635]  I'm sorry to the callers.
[02:51:48.715 --> 02:51:49.876]  I just can't get any more calls.
[02:51:49.896 --> 02:51:50.677]  We're out of time here.
[02:51:50.697 --> 02:51:53.961]  I've got some more news I want to hit, and it's too important not to cover it.
[02:51:54.481 --> 02:51:57.704]  I'll be on the radio this Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:51:57.744 --> 02:51:59.907]  on NewsRadio 590 KLBJ.
[02:51:59.967 --> 02:52:01.588]  You can listen via the web.
[02:52:01.628 --> 02:52:05.012]  In the next few months, we're going to be syndicating it to some cities around the United States.
[02:52:05.052 --> 02:52:07.174]  Hopefully getting Genesis to pick it up Sunday afternoons, too.
[02:52:08.115 --> 02:52:09.757]  But we've got to work all that out first.
[02:52:11.129 --> 02:52:13.251]  But 4 to 6 p.m., you can listen at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:13.271 --> 02:52:17.315]  And, of course, C-SPAN air an hour and 50 minutes of the 9-11 neocon agenda from L.A.
[02:52:17.355 --> 02:52:17.855]  last month.
[02:52:18.756 --> 02:52:20.398]  That's coming up Saturday at 8 p.m.
[02:52:20.478 --> 02:52:20.818]  Eastern.
[02:52:20.838 --> 02:52:22.520]  Details at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:22.920 --> 02:52:24.442]  Please tell everybody about that.
[02:52:24.462 --> 02:52:28.686]  And don't forget, you can now listen to my radio show that we do live each day from 11 to 2.
[02:52:29.146 --> 02:52:31.909]  On the Internet, we just air it over and over and over again.
[02:52:31.949 --> 02:52:33.030]  People kept asking for it.
[02:52:33.390 --> 02:52:36.253]  So we air it back to back over and over and over and over again.
[02:52:36.973 --> 02:52:41.977]  If you want to be able to, if you miss any part of the show or anything, or want to tune in on your leisure, when it's good for you, we do that for you.
[02:52:41.997 --> 02:52:44.359]  We pay for that now, so you have that for free up there.
[02:52:45.340 --> 02:52:47.041]  Riots erupt in southwest China.
[02:52:47.061 --> 02:52:48.522]  You ain't got a hand to the Chinese, folks.
[02:52:48.542 --> 02:52:49.703]  They come try to take their property.
[02:52:49.723 --> 02:52:57.068]  10,000 farmers will riot with clubs against hundreds of cops with machine guns, and they mow the people down, but the people then beat them to death.
[02:52:58.509 --> 02:53:02.052]  Oh yeah, they've been losing a lot of the big riots the government has over there.
[02:53:03.553 --> 02:53:05.955]  Chinese are more founding father than we are.
[02:53:07.646 --> 02:53:07.846]  Yep.
[02:53:08.507 --> 02:53:11.049]  Riots erupted in southwest China after Boyd beaten.
[02:53:11.609 --> 02:53:19.735]  About 2,000 people in the southwestern Chinese city attacked officials and smashed offices and cars last week after a 14-year-old student was beaten up by officials.
[02:53:20.155 --> 02:53:26.100]  A witness in Human Rights Group said Thursday, the riot in Bazhong in Xinjiang province.
[02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:36.664]  Again, after a middle school student tried to help a street vendor who was being harassed by city officials, a hotel worker who saw the incident shed, and the report is they beat the boy to death with their billy clubs.
[02:53:37.104 --> 02:53:45.707]  So groups of old people, young people, rioted, went in and beat up, and brutally, it says that some of the Chinese officials and people were in the hospital.
[02:53:47.087 --> 02:53:48.148]  Serves the scum right.
[02:53:49.188 --> 02:53:50.249]  And it just goes into that.
[02:53:50.269 --> 02:53:51.849]  And I forgot this article yesterday.
[02:53:51.869 --> 02:53:53.870]  I thought this would dovetail nicely in with this.
[02:53:54.705 --> 02:53:57.368]  China activist beat himself up, BBC.
[02:53:57.708 --> 02:54:06.897]  Chinese investigators say activist Fu Zhangkai, who was paralyzed after a severe beating, inflicted by blows on himself, according to a rights body.
[02:54:07.017 --> 02:54:07.518]  Ha ha!
[02:54:07.998 --> 02:54:09.099]  You've got to love it, folks.
[02:54:09.120 --> 02:54:11.962]  They beat the guy until he's paralyzed, and they say that all the time.
[02:54:12.022 --> 02:54:13.264]  Oh no, they beat themselves.
[02:54:14.185 --> 02:54:16.487]  Though we've got video of running over students with tanks.
[02:54:17.259 --> 02:54:27.545]  Mr. Fu, who campaigned for people displaced by Three Gorge Dam, was beaten up returning home after he was summoned by police in Hubai Province.
[02:54:29.746 --> 02:54:30.326]  I mean, poor guy.
[02:54:30.346 --> 02:54:33.088]  You don't see the picture of him beaten half to death with a broken back.
[02:54:33.749 --> 02:54:35.350]  But he did it to himself.
[02:54:35.410 --> 02:54:36.290]  We're the government.
[02:54:36.310 --> 02:54:41.952]  We're a bunch of criminal thugs with a flag, with badges, telling you that you're our slaves.
[02:54:42.492 --> 02:54:43.292]  And here in the U.S.
[02:54:43.332 --> 02:54:49.654]  and England, they're talking about in England making it the law, and here making it the law, to make you take vaccines that actually brain damage.
[02:54:49.694 --> 02:54:52.655]  You actually create plaques in the brain.
[02:54:52.895 --> 02:54:53.935]  Can you say Alzheimer's?
[02:54:54.135 --> 02:54:56.296]  This is one of the biggest stories out there, and nobody else.
[02:54:56.556 --> 02:54:57.977]  The news covers it every few months.
[02:54:58.237 --> 02:54:59.037]  I go and scream.
[02:54:59.357 --> 02:55:02.118]  None of the other truth media seem to freak out over this like I do.
[02:55:02.785 --> 02:55:04.286]  Maybe you guys out there can get them to.
[02:55:05.487 --> 02:55:13.333]  Here's one out of the U.S., Philadelphia, where they arrest Christians for preying on street corners and charge them as terrorists and try to send them to jail for 47 years.
[02:55:13.734 --> 02:55:16.776]  Man arrested for taking cell phone photo of police activity.
[02:55:17.217 --> 02:55:20.299]  A Philadelphia family said they were outraged over the arrest of one of their family members.
[02:55:20.839 --> 02:55:27.945]  The family of Mr. Cruz said police had no right to come onto their property and arrest a 21-year-old son simply because he was using a cell phone camera.
[02:55:28.245 --> 02:55:30.087]  They told the story, and he just took a picture...
[02:55:30.828 --> 02:55:33.230]  Or is it out the window and I'm doing something to somebody and they saw it?
[02:55:33.370 --> 02:55:39.614]  I see this every day now where they arrest us for having cameras, but then they have cameras everywhere and they're listening to our phone calls.
[02:55:41.395 --> 02:55:42.996]  Again, government's gone criminal.
[02:55:43.477 --> 02:55:44.678]  What can't you understand?
[02:55:44.718 --> 02:55:46.799]  It's the majority in world history.
[02:55:46.839 --> 02:55:47.980]  It's what normally happens.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:52.523]  If you believe in what we're doing, go to Infowars.com right now and...
[02:55:55.308 --> 02:55:56.488]  Order Terror Storm.
[02:55:56.548 --> 02:55:57.329]  Get Marshall Law.
[02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:58.029]  Get all my films.
[02:55:58.049 --> 02:55:58.829]  Get as many as you can.
[02:55:58.869 --> 02:55:59.489]  Make copies of them.
[02:55:59.509 --> 02:56:00.149]  Get them out to people.
