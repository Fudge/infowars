[00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:06.281]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:08.022]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:09.843]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.483 --> 00:00:11.304]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.985]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:21.909]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.332]  I want to get into the bird flu hoax today.
[00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.094]  Spend some time on it.
[00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.828]  A lot of new big developments concerning the story.
[00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:46.135]  Bird flu killed five young people in Azerbaijan, but then you read it hasn't been confirmed, and why people are sick with it in Egypt, but it hasn't been confirmed.
[00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:53.119]  And then a week after these stories come out, it always turns out that, well, it wasn't confirmed, and they didn't die of it, they died of the flu.
[00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.046]  We're good to go.
[00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:18.718]  There might not even be elections, but again, the government, sorry about that.
[00:01:18.758 --> 00:01:25.901]  They hate having to rule over you and take control, but somebody's got to do it to keep everyone safe.
[00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:32.424]  And with that and the terror threat, just all of this, they just need to lock down the cities and take your guns.
[00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:35.426]  They're real sorry about it.
[00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:39.440]  Schools told to prepare for the bird flu here in the United States.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.020]  We'll get into that.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.462]  And also, bird droppings prompt Orlando warning signs.
[00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:46.183]  See, now they have to put up warning signs.
[00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:50.805]  It introduces the threat of biologicals from terrorists or from birdies.
[00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:57.809]  And you're going to have to give up all your rights now, but after all, it's because of the terror threat and the bird flu.
[00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.636]  And remember, they've now got Viper teams, federal teams in Houston and Orlando and in D.C.
[00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:12.824]  and other areas, and they just go into malls and point guns at people and search everyone and wearing black uniforms and weird outfits with armor and just running around.
[00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:14.566]  Oh, we're just randomly looking for terrorists.
[00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:16.228]  Oh, we're just randomly looking for bird flu.
[00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:18.711]  We're just randomly running around taking all your freedoms.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.504]  Oh, by the way, President Bush is saying that he's against amnesty and how dare anyone propose it.
[00:02:24.864 --> 00:02:28.488]  No, he wants a guest worker program that is total amnesty.
[00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:32.992]  So, he's fighting amnesty with total amnesty.
[00:02:33.032 --> 00:02:33.913]  We'll get into that.
[00:02:33.973 --> 00:02:37.616]  New Mexico Democratic Party is calling for Lord Bush's impeachment.
[00:02:38.817 --> 00:02:42.539]  So there's a bigger call for that now growing all over the country.
[00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.940]  North Korean defector says disabled newborns are killed.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:57.725]  Well, I've interviewed socialist aid workers when I had a German doctor on years ago who went over there and was literally volunteering for years in the middle of it and witnessed the hell that was going on.
[00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:02.627]  They sell delicious baby parts in the little stalls there in the major cities.
[00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:09.294]  And everyone gobbles and enjoys themselves and it's all part of the great freedom of government and hereditary leaders.
[00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:17.158]  And we'll get into the New York Times reporting how wonderful it is that the media is staged.
[00:03:19.412 --> 00:03:37.205]  In Iraq, and the Pentagon has ruled on itself that it's okay for them to control the newspapers and put out fake news, meanwhile announcing in our news that they have free news and have freedom over there, just like they're now claiming we have freedom over here when billions are spent to pay off the media in the United States.
[00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:39.226]  Another little tidbit here.
[00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:45.611]  The Associated Press on a white plane in New York, high levels of radioactive material in the water.
[00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:49.573]  And I'm curious, why are they even reporting on this?
[00:03:49.673 --> 00:04:04.544]  Because the particular radioactive isotopes and metals that are in the water at high levels are nothing compared to DU, now in the air and the water worldwide, the equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs.
[00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:11.709]  I mean, what's the big... Again, they'll report on something that's serious but pales in significance to DU...
[00:04:13.143 --> 00:04:23.927]  And it'll be in the back of trade publications and the Atomic Energy Agency and in British papers that there's a six-fold increase in radiation in the atmosphere, and they've tested it.
[00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:25.107]  It is depleted uranium.
[00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:27.988]  And it's just not a problem.
[00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:28.769]  Everything's fine.
[00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:30.109]  Government loves you.
[00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.329]  Just get ready for the bird flu.
[00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.810]  We're going to have to get rid of your freedom.
[00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.791]  And another report here out of Reuters.
[00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:38.732]  Rights defenders targeted worldwide with torture and murder.
[00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:39.692]  Being killed.
[00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.313]  The Senate for Rights are being murdered and killed.
[00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:43.953]  Slaughtered, tortured, whatever.
[00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:47.097]  And we'll lug it into all this on the other side.
[00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:48.018]  Somebody's got to do it.
[00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:49.059]  Somebody's got to cover it.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.884]  I'm just glad the government's there to keep us all safe, aren't you?
[00:04:52.904 --> 00:04:55.807]  And to take over the entire economy.
[00:04:55.827 --> 00:05:00.133]  We just ought to be thankful for having this government.
[00:05:02.563 --> 00:05:05.406]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:06.387]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:07.248]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:12.273]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:19.360]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.661]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:24.702]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.802 --> 00:05:29.463]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:34.065]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:41.527]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:44.188]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:46.089]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:03.228 --> 00:06:04.269]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.372]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:11.796]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.236 --> 00:06:13.057]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:17.961]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.442 --> 00:06:20.564]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:21.905]  Sheltering in place.
[00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:35.750]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:42.837]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:43.197 --> 00:06:43.417]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:07:09.975 --> 00:07:12.597]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[00:07:12.757 --> 00:07:16.458]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:21.661]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:22.322]  We're good to go.
[00:07:44.582 --> 00:07:45.883]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:47.444]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:11.472]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:11.552 --> 00:08:15.846]  Now eight minutes, 12 seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:16.709]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:21.480]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:27.902]  It's real talk radio, real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:31.182]  We will have wide open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:08:31.202 --> 00:08:38.544]  We have some guests coming up later in the week, but I wanted to do a couple of broadcasts this week where we just have open phones.
[00:08:38.624 --> 00:08:40.845]  We did that partially yesterday for the first two hours.
[00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:42.326]  We're good to go.
[00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:42.486]  I think?
[00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:11.452]  We will have open phones today.
[00:09:11.512 --> 00:09:13.359]  I'd like to hear your comment on bird flu.
[00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:15.588]  It'd be nice if you can talk about whatever you want.
[00:09:16.454 --> 00:09:20.055]  Just tell us your first name, where you're calling from, but it'd be nice if you'd comment on bird flu.
[00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:21.495]  We haven't talked enough about this.
[00:09:21.896 --> 00:09:37.280]  We haven't also talked enough about the upcoming hostilities with the Islamic Republic of Iran over there, that 65 million person militarized nation just waiting to be attacked and then to lash out.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.060]  And then we're off to the races.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.441]  World War III.
[00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.221]  I shouldn't call it World War III.
[00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:44.602]  The CIA and Pentagon calls it World War IV.
[00:09:45.362 --> 00:09:45.923]  We're good to go.
[00:09:56.545 --> 00:10:00.166]  Bird flu killed five young people in Azerbaijan.
[00:10:00.186 --> 00:10:01.086]  These are the top headlines.
[00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:03.806]  Schools told to prepare for bird flu.
[00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:07.507]  Bird droppings prompt Orlando warning signs.
[00:10:08.027 --> 00:10:10.268]  These are the type of reports I have in front of me.
[00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:13.768]  The White House says it's definitely coming to the U.S.
[00:10:13.828 --> 00:10:14.789]  now in the next year.
[00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:15.709]  Guaranteed.
[00:10:15.729 --> 00:10:18.869]  Of course, a year ago they said it will hit us by winter.
[00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:19.930]  Guaranteed.
[00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.170]  That it will hit us by summer.
[00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.390]  Guaranteed.
[00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.571]  Now it's going to hit us next year.
[00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:25.851]  Guaranteed.
[00:10:26.731 --> 00:10:29.993]  And it's going to kill half the world's population.
[00:10:30.493 --> 00:10:31.554]  Guaranteed.
[00:10:32.575 --> 00:10:45.463]  Now, if you miss those headlines, they've actually said that they believe if it mutates to human-to-human transmission, that it could potentially kill half or more of the world population.
[00:10:45.823 --> 00:10:47.164]  That is what they are predicting.
[00:10:47.784 --> 00:10:52.067]  That is what our government and the European governments and the Russian government have said.
[00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:55.729]  It is a galactic, universal...
[00:10:57.164 --> 00:11:01.885]  Penultimate, infinity-style hoax.
[00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:03.326]  It is to the max.
[00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:07.667]  It is limitless in how fraudulent it is.
[00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:10.788]  Just look at what we face.
[00:11:10.848 --> 00:11:12.308]  We face staged terror.
[00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:15.249]  We face staged global warming.
[00:11:16.053 --> 00:11:21.815]  We face all of this hysteria, and their solutions never have anything to do.
[00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:27.678]  I mean, even if you believed that all these threats are coming, their solutions have nothing to do with stopping it.
[00:11:27.718 --> 00:11:32.600]  I mean, if you believe in global warming, we're certainly having climate change, but it isn't global warming.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.921]  Actually, the world's temperature has remained the same.
[00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:38.982]  They look at certain regions and go, oh, look, it's up three degrees in the last ten years.
[00:11:39.363 --> 00:11:41.363]  Oh, look, but it's down five degrees in these regions.
[00:11:41.964 --> 00:11:42.744]  Again, side issue.
[00:11:44.022 --> 00:11:44.262]  Thank you.
[00:12:00.795 --> 00:12:04.959]  We've got a small 15% left of what we had, and that is rapidly bleeding out.
[00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:15.428]  It's like they've hacked our legs off, and we're going into shock, and the blood is squirting out, and it's starting to go to a little trickle, and we're passing out and going unconscious, and we're dying as a nation.
[00:12:16.088 --> 00:12:17.069]  Not trying to be negative.
[00:12:17.149 --> 00:12:18.010]  That's the facts.
[00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.711]  The dollar is plunging.
[00:12:20.091 --> 00:12:21.112]  We're at all-time debts.
[00:12:21.152 --> 00:12:24.015]  We have higher debts than at any time in U.S.
[00:12:24.055 --> 00:12:27.278]  history, higher than the depths of the Depression in 1933.
[00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:45.036]  And the media tells you that everything is wonderful when the out-of-wedlock births are at the highest levels, when diseases and cancers are at the highest levels, our sperm counts are at the highest levels, our birth defects are at the highest levels.
[00:12:45.476 --> 00:12:48.257]  Everything is going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:12:50.018 --> 00:12:50.338]  Yes.
[00:12:51.038 --> 00:12:53.319]  And it's all been done by design.
[00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:55.680]  It's all been done by design.
[00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:03.237]  And the government knows that the sun is going absolutely ape right now.
[00:13:03.317 --> 00:13:12.139]  The last 11-year cycle was the biggest ever recorded in over 110 years of recording the heat being generated by the sun.
[00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:22.981]  And now they're saying the new cycle to start late this year or early next year, and this is multiple governments saying this, and this is the readings, this is the real science, is that it's going to be 50% brighter.
[00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:39.022]  The total radiation output, both heat and the different rays, the solar rays, the gamma rays, the X-rays, the particles being ejected from the sun, will be 50% higher.
[00:13:39.042 --> 00:13:41.183]  Let me tell you something.
[00:13:41.203 --> 00:13:43.185]  Your car isn't causing that to happen.
[00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:57.265]  I was reading all these reports a few weeks ago, and I was laying in bed one night and couldn't sleep, so I turned on television, which I hardly ever do, and it was Superman 1, the start of it, on HBO.
[00:13:58.306 --> 00:14:01.147]  Why do I even have the full cable package if I don't even use it?
[00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:11.214]  And it's Terrell or Jor-El or whatever his name is, out at the planet of Krypton, and the sun's heating up and the planet blows up.
[00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:15.848]  I'm not saying that's going to happen, but there's a reason we have climate change on this planet.
[00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:18.750]  There's a reason seas rise and seas lower.
[00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:31.297]  There's a reason that once the rainforest belt went up into Canada and down to Antarctica, and now it's just around a very slim area of the equator.
[00:14:31.357 --> 00:14:34.359]  We have natural climate change.
[00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:40.823]  And they admit that a major volcanic eruption puts out more fossil fuel gases...
[00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:42.462]  We're good to go.
[00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:58.661]  We're good to go.
[00:15:15.387 --> 00:15:23.812]  And you know, for six months, the sunsets are beautiful and purple and red because of all the dust, and for six months a year, your car has dust on it every day?
[00:15:24.192 --> 00:15:24.912]  Yes, those.
[00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:27.834]  Those dwarf everything that we've ever done.
[00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:29.975]  Stop thinking you're so big and powerful.
[00:15:32.376 --> 00:15:35.918]  Where man is big and powerful is trying to play God with the genetic engineering.
[00:15:35.938 --> 00:15:38.579]  Now that's what the real threat is.
[00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:42.661]  That's crazy.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.903]  So I'm just trying to give everybody some perspective on where we are.
[00:15:48.743 --> 00:15:53.886]  You know, all these Planet X nuts who constantly for a decade have been saying, Planet X is going to kill us any minute.
[00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:55.407]  It's just made up trite.
[00:15:55.447 --> 00:15:56.588]  And I'm sorry if you don't like hearing it.
[00:15:56.608 --> 00:15:57.528]  I just tell it like it is.
[00:15:58.629 --> 00:16:00.250]  Do heavenly bodies come through our system?
[00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.590]  Are there a bunch of rocks out there?
[00:16:01.891 --> 00:16:03.051]  There's not just a 10th planet.
[00:16:03.071 --> 00:16:04.292]  There's an 11th, a 12th.
[00:16:05.192 --> 00:16:09.475]  They've cataloged dozens and dozens of pieces of junk bigger than our moon.
[00:16:10.126 --> 00:16:12.048]  Bigger than Pluto floating around out there.
[00:16:12.068 --> 00:16:15.511]  There's all of their asteroid belt outside past Pluto.
[00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:23.178]  It makes the one in between Mars and the next planet look small.
[00:16:23.918 --> 00:16:26.160]  So yes, I'm not saying that stuff like that isn't a danger.
[00:16:26.741 --> 00:16:32.206]  But everybody hypes up Planet X. Meanwhile, the sun's going completely crazy right now.
[00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:36.342]  And just hardly anyone even knows about it.
[00:16:36.602 --> 00:16:40.164]  So, see, we'll talk about real things that are going on.
[00:16:40.184 --> 00:16:42.025]  Oh, by the way, do a scientific test.
[00:16:43.406 --> 00:16:46.547]  Put a bucket of ice and fill it.
[00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:50.489]  Fill it with the ice heaped up up on top of it, above the rim.
[00:16:51.070 --> 00:17:01.895]  And then watch as it melts, and it won't even overflow over the edges because water, because of the ring structures and the molecules, when it freezes, displaces a larger area.
[00:17:04.108 --> 00:17:09.412]  And that's why you can cram a big glass full of water and ice at the top where it's brimming.
[00:17:09.432 --> 00:17:11.694]  And when it melts, it'll actually lower.
[00:17:13.556 --> 00:17:20.881]  So if the ice caps actually melt, we're going to see the seas go down.
[00:17:21.262 --> 00:17:21.982]  Did you know that?
[00:17:22.963 --> 00:17:23.623]  Did you know that?
[00:17:24.204 --> 00:17:25.585]  And that's got its own...
[00:17:27.475 --> 00:17:28.676]  It's own set of problems.
[00:17:28.696 --> 00:17:43.923]  What they're finding really raises the sea level is mountain ranges displacing trillions upon trillions of tons upward from the mantle through the crust to the surface.
[00:17:44.344 --> 00:17:56.650]  Just like when they had that 9.2 out in the fiery rim out in the Pacific and hundreds of islands got covered with water for a few hours and hundreds of thousands died.
[00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:57.030]  Remember?
[00:17:58.183 --> 00:18:07.565]  You see, that's what's raising sea levels several inches, is that there are mountain ranges being shoved up, displacing water.
[00:18:09.326 --> 00:18:12.006]  And there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:18:12.026 --> 00:18:13.827]  All right, so I said I'd get into bird flu.
[00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:17.868]  I'm just trying to give you an example of how they have all these hoaxes.
[00:18:17.948 --> 00:18:27.650]  Oh, let's have a world tax on energy, just on the Western world, to further de-industrialize and move wealth into the slave client states of the globalists.
[00:18:28.317 --> 00:18:31.178]  When it does nothing to stop the climate change that's going on.
[00:18:32.158 --> 00:18:33.818]  I do not debate the climate change.
[00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:41.080]  But the term global warming is a manifest fraud in triplicate.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.741]  Now, when we get back, I will get into the bird flu hoax.
[00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:48.321]  Now, I am not saying there isn't going to be a bird flu outbreak.
[00:18:48.681 --> 00:18:51.402]  I'm not saying you're not going to hold your babies dead in your arms.
[00:18:52.082 --> 00:18:56.603]  I'm not saying there's not going to be checkpoints and troops and foreign troops coming into America.
[00:18:57.628 --> 00:18:58.931]  But I'm telling you, it's a hoax.
[00:19:00.114 --> 00:19:00.675]  You understand?
[00:19:00.715 --> 00:19:04.163]  Whatever's going to be released is man-made, and they admit this thing's man-made.
[00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:09.123]  And this may just be a dress rehearsal for five years down the road when they release something.
[00:19:09.403 --> 00:19:10.804]  Training you how to be locked down.
[00:19:10.885 --> 00:19:12.166]  Training you how to show your papers.
[00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:13.707]  Training you how to be a slave.
[00:19:13.767 --> 00:19:15.308]  Training you how to go into quarantine.
[00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:20.292]  All preparing you for the... Just like Jim Jones, drilling them with drinking the Kool-Aid a thousand times.
[00:19:20.312 --> 00:19:25.416]  And when they really drilled them for real, they drank it down, gulping it down, the cherry Kool-Aid, with pleasure.
[00:19:25.436 --> 00:19:28.998]  Then they went into writhing convulsions and died within 60 seconds apiece.
[00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:30.780]  You see, you're being drilled.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.001]  You're being domesticated.
[00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:33.342]  You're being enslaved.
[00:19:33.362 --> 00:19:34.703]  You're being brought into evil.
[00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:46.742]  And the globalists openly say, Henry Kissinger, the big world bank, the IMF, the World Health Organization, they openly say they're going to use control plagues to kill us.
[00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:50.844]  But they've got to train us how to behave while they're killing us.
[00:19:50.864 --> 00:19:52.285]  They want to make it orderly.
[00:19:53.046 --> 00:19:58.328]  So let's all learn how to orderly drink our Kool-Aid when we get back, okay?
[00:19:58.569 --> 00:19:59.149]  Stay with me.
[00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.211]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:09.292]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:20:09.572 --> 00:20:14.694]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:20:15.034 --> 00:20:24.317]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:20:24.677 --> 00:20:29.641]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:33.944]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:20:34.164 --> 00:20:38.928]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:20:39.288 --> 00:20:45.193]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:51.762]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:20:52.864 --> 00:20:53.745]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:02.515]  We're good to go.
[00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:29.235]  You'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[00:22:02.031 --> 00:22:10.658]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[00:22:11.479 --> 00:22:16.443]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[00:22:17.143 --> 00:22:23.126]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:32.331]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their one world government.
[00:22:33.032 --> 00:22:40.676]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:01.145 --> 00:23:03.226]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[00:23:03.446 --> 00:23:05.687]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:06.667]  New toenails?
[00:23:07.047 --> 00:23:08.027]  What happened to the old ones?
[00:23:09.008 --> 00:23:11.669]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy looking.
[00:23:12.199 --> 00:23:13.640]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.442]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[00:23:16.682 --> 00:23:18.043]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[00:23:18.484 --> 00:23:20.165]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[00:23:20.325 --> 00:23:21.686]  My toenails are a disaster.
[00:23:21.746 --> 00:23:24.548]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[00:23:24.768 --> 00:23:25.969]  Well, here's my secret.
[00:23:26.574 --> 00:23:27.595]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:32.158]  It clears out yellowing and keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:33.779]  Ah, so that's it.
[00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:36.560]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[00:23:36.841 --> 00:23:38.482]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:42.004]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[00:23:42.444 --> 00:23:42.985]  You bet!
[00:23:43.225 --> 00:23:47.331]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[00:23:47.471 --> 00:23:49.013]  Thanks to Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:23:49.393 --> 00:23:50.535]  Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:52.377]  For clear, healthy-looking nails.
[00:23:52.738 --> 00:23:57.844]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Longs, Duane Reade, and Walmart.
[00:23:58.024 --> 00:23:59.066]  In the foot care section.
[00:24:08.662 --> 00:24:11.846]  Twelve years ago, I began to really get educated on the New World Order.
[00:24:12.306 --> 00:24:22.417]  And I was always shocked that even then, you know, I was reading declassified Henry Kissinger documents where they'd tell the third world, we'll give you IMF World Bank money, but you've got to forcibly sterilize half your women.
[00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:26.110]  And then they talk about strategic plans to reduce world population by 80%.
[00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:36.574]  I mean, Australian documents from the 50s, British documents from the 60s, where, oh, we'll put special viruses in the corn.
[00:24:36.594 --> 00:24:40.335]  We're going to ship to Africa to sterilize them, and we'll do all this.
[00:24:40.415 --> 00:24:44.196]  And then you go to college, and the professors are going, the people bomb.
[00:24:44.557 --> 00:24:46.377]  We've got to get rid of the population.
[00:24:46.397 --> 00:24:48.138]  I'm like, hey, buddy, you line up first.
[00:24:49.472 --> 00:24:58.474]  China gets all these UN awards for one-child policy and forced abortions and killing babies that are already born if the mother... They usually don't kill the second one.
[00:24:58.494 --> 00:25:05.256]  They just fine them and fire them or jail them or take the child away into government custody and raise them in an orphanage by age six.
[00:25:05.276 --> 00:25:06.516]  They're working in a slave factory.
[00:25:06.736 --> 00:25:08.577]  Literally, that's what a lot of the schools in China are.
[00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:14.045]  And the mother has a third child, they're going to kill it and take the body for medical parts.
[00:25:14.666 --> 00:25:16.728]  That's mainstream news, okay?
[00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:22.293]  Our government likes them and gives them awards for it and funds and grants.
[00:25:22.313 --> 00:25:23.014]  Do you understand?
[00:25:24.435 --> 00:25:29.820]  There's the evidence of the psychopathic nature of the people that are running our government.
[00:25:30.385 --> 00:25:37.250]  They think China's great banning weird baby names and telling people where they can work and what they can do and having public executions.
[00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.391]  That's the model.
[00:25:38.431 --> 00:25:42.774]  The CFR, the managers of this country, openly laud it.
[00:25:43.274 --> 00:25:46.036]  They want these, quote, organized, controlled societies.
[00:25:48.097 --> 00:25:49.598]  And they clearly engineered AIDS.
[00:25:49.638 --> 00:25:51.860]  They clearly have engineered so much of this.
[00:25:53.181 --> 00:25:55.042]  And so then we hear this crowd...
[00:25:56.995 --> 00:26:00.417]  Who is into constantly talking about how they want to exterminate us.
[00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:12.286]  Jacques Cousteau, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, writing books, giving newspaper interviews, TV interviews, saying it for decades, funding big foundations that are doing it, on and on and on.
[00:26:12.306 --> 00:26:14.127]  Why do you think this stuff's in popular culture?
[00:26:14.568 --> 00:26:18.110]  Take the James Bond movies, one that came out a few years ago.
[00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:22.093]  People are getting killed for their organs, and James Bond's fighting it.
[00:26:22.777 --> 00:26:30.480]  We'll take Moonraker, where this crazy industrialist, this billionaire, is going to release a bioweapon to kill everyone on the Earth, and then they're going to resettle it.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.541]  Where do you think they get those ideas for those movies?
[00:26:34.022 --> 00:26:37.663]  Because it isn't going to be James Bond fighting, killing everyone.
[00:26:37.703 --> 00:26:40.184]  It's going to be James Bond killing everyone.
[00:26:40.774 --> 00:26:43.156]  Do you understand James Bond is the bad guy?
[00:26:43.216 --> 00:26:44.877]  James Bond bombs buses.
[00:26:45.237 --> 00:26:47.959]  James Bond blows up ships and blames it on his enemies.
[00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:54.684]  James Bond gets caught dressed up like Arabs blowing up mosques and shooting people and running around with plastic explosives.
[00:26:54.764 --> 00:26:56.205]  James Bond is bad.
[00:26:56.545 --> 00:26:58.146]  James Bond is slick.
[00:26:58.386 --> 00:26:59.347]  And he's a terrorist.
[00:26:59.607 --> 00:27:01.749]  And he'll karate chop you in the neck and kill you.
[00:27:01.969 --> 00:27:03.730]  And he'll release bioweapons on you.
[00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.492]  And there's thousands of James Bond terrorists right now.
[00:27:07.685 --> 00:27:09.626]  Yeah, that's who James Bond is.
[00:27:10.206 --> 00:27:10.606]  Okay?
[00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:12.327]  He's not the good guy.
[00:27:13.027 --> 00:27:14.847]  James Bond is the main enemy.
[00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:18.649]  The real James Bonds of the world are New World Order boys and girls.
[00:27:20.989 --> 00:27:23.390]  So, I'm going to get into bird flu now.
[00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.291]  It'll take as long as it takes, then we'll get to your calls.
[00:27:26.031 --> 00:27:34.734]  It's just that we have a crowd who openly says they want to kill us, who openly says they want to use controlled biological attacks to get rid of most of us, and to, quote, organize society.
[00:27:35.818 --> 00:27:52.911]  And then suddenly they go dig up corpses six years ago at the North Pole of dead whalers, and they get this virus, and I say, you watch, suddenly it's going to pop up, and they're going to say it's been given to foreign countries, and sure enough, our government mails it out to over a hundred laboratories.
[00:27:53.451 --> 00:27:56.692]  And they mail out to over 600 laboratories, one that's even more deadly.
[00:27:56.932 --> 00:28:02.995]  They've got one 30-something thousand times more deadly than this bird flu right up there at the University of Wisconsin.
[00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:05.135]  That's in the Associated Press.
[00:28:05.175 --> 00:28:08.977]  They've got it in a Level 3 bio lab, not even Level 4.
[00:28:09.437 --> 00:28:11.858]  They're mailing this stuff out to anybody who wants it.
[00:28:11.878 --> 00:28:13.479]  They gave stuff like this to Saddam.
[00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.760]  Our government did in the mid-'90s during the sanctions.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.301]  That's been in major newspapers.
[00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:21.742]  What was the last one I saw it in a few years ago?
[00:28:21.762 --> 00:28:22.262]  It was in the...
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.321]  Buffalo newspaper.
[00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:25.942]  This is all admitted.
[00:28:25.982 --> 00:28:26.863]  Do you understand?
[00:28:27.283 --> 00:28:30.225]  They've handed it out to everybody so they have plausible deniability.
[00:28:30.606 --> 00:28:41.914]  The Australian government three years ago released the design for mousepox, which you can convert to any mammal you wish and kills 99% of any mammal it comes in contact with.
[00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:43.876]  And they released...
[00:28:44.668 --> 00:28:47.649]  The university, under government orders, and the university protested.
[00:28:47.689 --> 00:28:48.870]  Professors said, what are you doing?
[00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:54.092]  They released the design, the entire genetic code of mousepox.
[00:28:54.992 --> 00:29:00.374]  It can be converted by a high-tech lab in a matter of months to kill any mammalian species.
[00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:02.755]  Do you understand?
[00:29:02.775 --> 00:29:07.937]  I'm sitting here watching this happen, watching these creeps.
[00:29:08.277 --> 00:29:10.358]  You think they killed 3,000 people on 9-11.
[00:29:10.378 --> 00:29:12.439]  You think they care about you and your family?
[00:29:15.251 --> 00:29:16.591]  And listen, I'm tired of being right.
[00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:25.053]  Police, military listening to me, people in government right now, please don't five, ten years from now when this really happens, because this Berkeley thing is a dress rehearsal, I believe.
[00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:28.574]  When this really comes down, just please don't go, oh man, he was right.
[00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:33.295]  When you're in your house and your family's dying around you and you're dying, just please.
[00:29:34.295 --> 00:29:36.036]  You know I've been right about everything else.
[00:29:36.056 --> 00:29:36.596]  You know that.
[00:29:37.336 --> 00:29:38.836]  You know you can research what I'm saying.
[00:29:39.337 --> 00:29:41.277]  Just realize it.
[00:29:42.006 --> 00:29:45.749]  You see, because they won't do this unless they think we'll go along with it properly when they do it.
[00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:48.951]  So we'll get into the bird flu and more detail when we get back.
[00:29:49.011 --> 00:29:49.771]  I've shut it up now.
[00:29:49.791 --> 00:29:50.312]  We'll get into it.
[00:29:51.792 --> 00:29:52.713]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.193 --> 00:29:54.814]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.715 --> 00:29:58.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.658 --> 00:30:06.104]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:30:06.385 --> 00:30:09.990]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:18.242]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:30:18.482 --> 00:30:24.124]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:30:24.424 --> 00:30:29.685]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:30:29.926 --> 00:30:32.026]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[00:30:32.286 --> 00:30:44.430]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:49.095]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:30:49.315 --> 00:30:50.257]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:50.437 --> 00:30:52.059]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:30:52.199 --> 00:30:54.001]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:30:54.241 --> 00:30:54.722]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:30:54.762 --> 00:30:54.942]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.641]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:07.883]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:08.003 --> 00:31:10.885]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.965 --> 00:31:17.648]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.848 --> 00:31:20.850]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:21.071 --> 00:31:23.452]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.612 --> 00:31:33.660]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptosine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.420]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.441]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:32:02.222 --> 00:32:05.364]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:12.428]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:32:12.868 --> 00:32:26.216]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:32:26.536 --> 00:32:30.278]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:32:30.606 --> 00:32:31.666]  We're good to go.
[00:32:31.686 --> 00:32:31.986]  I think?
[00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:12.321]  We're back live.
[00:33:12.461 --> 00:33:17.608]  Chris, Ted, Leslie, James, Anita, many others.
[00:33:17.628 --> 00:33:18.729]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:24.076]  I want to go summon to the bird flu and the hoax and what the globalists are up to, what they're engaging in.
[00:33:24.998 --> 00:33:26.700]  Here in just a few minutes, then we'll start going to your
[00:33:27.307 --> 00:33:27.867]  Going to your calls.
[00:33:27.968 --> 00:33:28.648]  Oh, a correction.
[00:33:28.668 --> 00:33:36.234]  I was going from memory during the second segment talking about the sun saying it's going to... It's radiated power is going to double in the next 11 years according to NASA and others.
[00:33:36.554 --> 00:33:43.159]  Again, I don't know if that's the case, but we know we did just have the biggest sun cycle ever recorded in the last 11-year cycle.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.723]  But I was going to add to that that I was incorrect.
[00:33:49.184 --> 00:33:50.305]  I was thinking about during the break.
[00:33:50.565 --> 00:33:51.466]  It was a 50% increase...
[00:33:54.235 --> 00:33:57.118]  In its current brightness, not a doubling.
[00:33:58.299 --> 00:34:02.463]  The record cycle was just a 5% increase they were reporting.
[00:34:02.743 --> 00:34:06.226]  So imagine what a 50% increase is.
[00:34:06.486 --> 00:34:08.008]  It's just huge.
[00:34:08.568 --> 00:34:09.429]  I was saying doubling.
[00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:10.930]  That's the kind of mistakes I make.
[00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.611]  No, a 50% increase.
[00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:12.932]  So a very, very, very, very,
[00:34:19.809 --> 00:34:20.350]  Serious.
[00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.833]  So I guess 50% would be if I weighed 100 pounds, that means I would be 150 pounds.
[00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:27.516]  We're going to, again, go to your calls here in a few minutes.
[00:34:27.797 --> 00:34:34.663]  I thought about taking control of your life and not drinking the poisons that are in the water, the allowable levels of it.
[00:34:34.723 --> 00:34:36.004]  Let me just read to you.
[00:34:36.024 --> 00:34:38.326]  It's here in my stack.
[00:34:38.527 --> 00:34:40.048]  I'm trying to find it.
[00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.949]  Here it is.
[00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.994]  This is Associated Press today, up on infowars.com, prisonbomb.com.
[00:34:46.434 --> 00:34:49.057]  High levels of radioactive material in water.
[00:34:49.437 --> 00:34:50.398]  White Plains, New York.
[00:34:50.438 --> 00:34:54.042]  High levels of radioactive material, nearly three times the amount permitted.
[00:34:54.383 --> 00:34:56.986]  See, a lot of it's permitted at very dangerous levels.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:02.241]  We're found in groundwater near the Hudson River beneath a nuclear plant, the owner said Tuesday.
[00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:05.062]  The groundwater does not intersect drinking supplies.
[00:35:05.142 --> 00:35:05.702]  Sure, it doesn't.
[00:35:06.042 --> 00:35:16.546]  And although the strontium-90 is believed to have reached the Hudson, it would be safely diluted in the water of the river, said Jim Street, spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Northeast.
[00:35:17.046 --> 00:35:19.446]  And they have the spokesman for the plant saying everything's fine.
[00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:20.447]  Everything is fine.
[00:35:20.787 --> 00:35:21.327]  Just drink up.
[00:35:21.889 --> 00:35:22.649]  We're good to go.
[00:35:41.994 --> 00:35:43.015]  Well, someone can't read.
[00:35:43.035 --> 00:35:50.141]  The test well is among nine, Doug, in an attempt to pinpoint the leak contaminated water was first found in August.
[00:35:50.601 --> 00:35:57.867]  Energy findings match tests by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the same sample, Streets said.
[00:35:57.887 --> 00:36:05.774]  The sample also yielded tritium, another potential carcinogen, at levels well above the drinking water standard.
[00:36:06.154 --> 00:36:09.637]  High levels had been found earlier at another test well as well.
[00:36:10.357 --> 00:36:10.858]  I think.
[00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:11.078]  I think.
[00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:47.956]  Again, the Army's own handbooks, the Navy's own handbooks, the big National Mining Association's own manuals, the miners' manuals, just mining uranium itself, which isn't even purified, have reported that you get this in your lungs.
[00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:52.398]  The toxicity, the radioactivity, and of course the particulate.
[00:36:52.678 --> 00:36:57.481]  It's so small that it just goes right through cell walls and just fries the DNA and causes cancer.
[00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:00.202]  It just goes right through and then it's a huge short circuit.
[00:37:01.281 --> 00:37:09.468]  And they've used the equivalent, the same tonnage, as 44,000 Hiroshima or Nagasaki A-bombs.
[00:37:10.969 --> 00:37:14.331]  I say Hiroshima or Nagasaki, I forget which one of them, but that's official government numbers.
[00:37:14.351 --> 00:37:17.334]  One of the bombs was bigger, so it's either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.
[00:37:17.354 --> 00:37:18.074]  I've got to dig that up.
[00:37:19.175 --> 00:37:25.300]  But 44,000 of these, and it has a multi-million year half-life.
[00:37:26.836 --> 00:37:29.997]  And it's blowing around, and detectors all over the world are picking it up.
[00:37:30.037 --> 00:37:35.779]  Just type in, nuclear power plant detectors pick up DU.
[00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:41.240]  Or just type in, radiation detectors pick up high levels of radiation.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.041]  And you'll get Times and London Associated Press.
[00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:44.541]  But it's never big nightly news.
[00:37:44.741 --> 00:37:45.542]  It's in a newspaper.
[00:37:45.582 --> 00:37:46.402]  It's on a newswire.
[00:37:46.942 --> 00:37:50.683]  And then Halliburton openly goes and buys the plants around the world.
[00:37:50.703 --> 00:37:51.804]  They just bought a big one in England.
[00:37:51.824 --> 00:37:53.364]  And then they say, we're no longer releasing that data.
[00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:55.060]  They actually go by it.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:55.860]  Halliburton does.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.502]  I guess they're Satan's errand boy.
[00:37:59.302 --> 00:38:01.924]  And so with that said, I meant to get to that at the start of the show.
[00:38:01.944 --> 00:38:03.585]  We'll go to Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[00:38:04.345 --> 00:38:09.909]  And it cuts out the mercury, the herbicides, the pesticides, the bacteria.
[00:38:10.489 --> 00:38:16.232]  Even if you're drinking tap water with chlorine, which isn't good for you, you're still drinking dead bacteria.
[00:38:16.553 --> 00:38:17.793]  Debbie, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:38:18.074 --> 00:38:18.574]  Hi, Alex.
[00:38:18.674 --> 00:38:20.495]  Thank you very much for having me.
[00:38:20.535 --> 00:38:21.976]  It was really interesting.
[00:38:22.731 --> 00:38:35.940]  Getting an opportunity to listen to the things that you were saying about the water in the New York area with the radiation in it and things like that and the bird flu viruses.
[00:38:36.421 --> 00:38:39.563]  So I enjoy being able to be on and hear you sometimes.
[00:38:40.476 --> 00:38:44.602]  Well, what I like is the big nuclear reactor they have in North Austin of the J.J.
[00:38:44.642 --> 00:38:50.329]  Jake Pickle Research Facility sitting on top of a huge aquifer just 100 feet down.
[00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:51.350]  I think that's delicious, too.
[00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:52.592]  Oh, I bet.
[00:38:54.174 --> 00:38:54.855]  I know.
[00:38:55.135 --> 00:38:55.376]  I know.
[00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:57.018]  Well, they have the one in Glen Rose, too.
[00:38:57.828 --> 00:38:58.789]  It's right on the water.
[00:38:59.769 --> 00:39:01.690]  They got one down by Houston.
[00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:02.831]  Yep, yep.
[00:39:02.871 --> 00:39:03.571]  They're everywhere.
[00:39:03.711 --> 00:39:05.132]  People don't realize it.
[00:39:05.392 --> 00:39:06.232]  But it's nutritious.
[00:39:06.252 --> 00:39:06.993]  It's nutritious.
[00:39:07.073 --> 00:39:07.573]  Everything's fine.
[00:39:07.893 --> 00:39:19.959]  Yeah, and so if you want, you can go ahead and not buy a Berkey water filter and not get the contaminants out of the water, or you can wake up and get a Berkey water filter and at least take control of your life.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.402]  I've had several customers recently call me and ask me if we take out the bird flu virus.
[00:39:27.905 --> 00:39:36.510]  And I want to explain on the air that we have never tested, obviously, for the bird flu virus, so we can't say yes or no today.
[00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:49.217]  But under university studies, under electron microscopes, where they pour what they call lawn growth, basically green swamp water, into the test murky, and then they take petri dishes of that water, and a week later, it is not detectable.
[00:39:49.577 --> 00:39:50.138]  Exactly.
[00:39:50.498 --> 00:39:51.519]  There is nothing in it.
[00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:52.699]  There is no life in it.
[00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:57.262]  Right, and you can pre-treat your water with chlorine bleach.
[00:39:58.551 --> 00:40:04.475]  16 drops of chlorine bleach per gallon of water prior to filtering it through the Berkey.
[00:40:04.915 --> 00:40:09.598]  The Berkey will take the bleach out, and the bleach will kill any viruses that are in there.
[00:40:09.618 --> 00:40:10.538]  Exactly.
[00:40:10.558 --> 00:40:12.680]  So there are ways to treat that.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:20.645]  But I have seen the University study, the University of Louisiana there do one of those studies, and it does knock out viruses, I can tell you.
[00:40:21.025 --> 00:40:22.105]  Yep, it sure does.
[00:40:22.185 --> 00:40:26.148]  So I just wanted to reiterate that for people.
[00:40:26.548 --> 00:40:33.619]  And let them know that we would love to hear from them and that we have Alex Jones specials.
[00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:40.970]  We're very proud to be supporting your airtime and look forward to hearing you on for years and years.
[00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:43.271]  That's right.
[00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:50.474]  You guys are the sole sponsor for six hours a day, five days a week, on WWCR Blowtorch, day and night.
[00:40:51.074 --> 00:41:08.700]  And, again, the International Service doesn't bring in any funds to this operation, but we do get letters and emails from around the world, people listening in China, Africa, Malaysia, Europe, on cruise ships in the Caribbean, people in Antarctica at weather stations.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.861]  So it's a global reach.
[00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:11.661]  I think so.
[00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:39.202]  No, it's static, I think.
[00:41:39.262 --> 00:41:40.543]  I don't know what that was.
[00:41:40.723 --> 00:41:41.424]  I'm teasing you.
[00:41:41.564 --> 00:41:42.124]  I'm teasing you.
[00:41:42.384 --> 00:41:43.385]  Debbie's a real sweetheart.
[00:41:43.405 --> 00:41:44.265]  I've met her several times.
[00:41:45.125 --> 00:41:47.307]  But seriously, go to BerkeyWater.com or link through.
[00:41:47.367 --> 00:41:50.328]  You can get them off the shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[00:41:50.348 --> 00:41:53.890]  And every time the order comes in, we just fax the order over to Debbie up in Dallas.
[00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.630]  So again, 888-803-4438.
[00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.391]  Anything else, Debbie?
[00:41:58.212 --> 00:41:59.234]  Nope, that'll do it.
[00:41:59.314 --> 00:42:02.317]  I'm here ready to answer your calls, so please call me.
[00:42:02.657 --> 00:42:03.438]  Debbie, you're awesome.
[00:42:03.478 --> 00:42:04.159]  Godspeed.
[00:42:04.379 --> 00:42:05.361]  Thank you very much.
[00:42:05.441 --> 00:42:05.941]  You too.
[00:42:06.061 --> 00:42:06.382]  You bet.
[00:42:06.402 --> 00:42:06.882]  Take care.
[00:42:07.203 --> 00:42:11.087]  BerkeyWater.com or link through at InfoWars.com or order at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:11.387 --> 00:42:12.188]  Do it today.
[00:42:12.389 --> 00:42:13.690]  And look, I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:42:14.291 --> 00:42:17.695]  I'm not even worried about radioactive isotopes in the water.
[00:42:17.755 --> 00:42:18.516]  It's in the air.
[00:42:20.417 --> 00:42:21.317]  You're going to get poisoned.
[00:42:22.177 --> 00:42:23.078]  Things are insane now.
[00:42:23.138 --> 00:42:26.519]  And again, if you heard my show four or five years ago, I didn't really get into all this stuff.
[00:42:26.579 --> 00:42:28.380]  I hadn't researched it as much.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.941]  Now I've researched it, and we are in a toxic brew.
[00:42:32.041 --> 00:42:34.362]  It is totally insane.
[00:42:35.102 --> 00:42:46.527]  But the environmental groups, Lock, Stock, and Barrel, Hook, Line, and Sinker, are controlled by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, Lapew, Charitable Trust, and others, which openly were set up turn of the last century to land grab.
[00:42:47.108 --> 00:43:01.497]  Rockefellers created the modern land-grabbing organizations, Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, Audubon Society, and they're the biggest realtors in the country now, and they just get land and later build casinos or golf courses or hotels on it.
[00:43:02.058 --> 00:43:05.120]  Even right here in our town, they claim it's going to be, oh, a 15,000-acre park.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:10.183]  We're taking these ranchers' property and not paying them, but about five cents on the dollar, and we're forcing them to.
[00:43:10.843 --> 00:43:16.547]  But then they turn around, oh, we're building hotels and luxury golf courses and million-dollar ranch at homes for the elite.
[00:43:17.702 --> 00:43:20.705]  Well, we're going to build a nuclear power plant on it down by Houston.
[00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:22.606]  Oh, it was an environmental movement.
[00:43:23.027 --> 00:43:40.442]  So, see, this is what they... Oh, they're not concerned about the chimeras, the cross-species genetic engineering that Nobel Prize winners on this broadcast have told you could give rise to super viruses and bacteria and is already causing cross-species jumping of deadly pathogens, deadly bugs, deadly genetics.
[00:43:41.182 --> 00:44:00.277]  Uh, prions, uh, we're talking about mycoplasms, all this insanity, uh, introducing, uh, uh, engineered algaes into the oceans, uh, that then cause major problems, uh, just, just so much that's going on, and no, no, no, we're just worried about grabbing your property.
[00:44:00.297 --> 00:44:08.363]  You know, when the young, uh, college student comes to your door and says, knock, knock, hi, I'm here with the local environmental group, would you like to give money to save the earth?
[00:44:09.224 --> 00:44:16.130]  No, I'm not going to give money for you to grab someone's private property for your Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.351]  What do you mean?
[00:44:17.431 --> 00:44:18.592]  How dare you say that?
[00:44:18.833 --> 00:44:20.174]  Hey, go check your facts out.
[00:44:21.015 --> 00:44:22.396]  You just don't care about the earth.
[00:44:22.876 --> 00:44:24.798]  No, you just better get off my porch.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:27.781]  All right, I'm ranting.
[00:44:29.526 --> 00:44:31.447]  Let me just get into bird flu now in more detail.
[00:44:32.107 --> 00:44:39.851]  So we have these elites that have openly been writing and saying and funding population reductions, and they openly say that they want to get rid of us with huge release control plagues.
[00:44:40.371 --> 00:44:50.696]  And then hundreds and hundreds, it's over 200 now, top bioweapons experts in Houston, Texas, and in Virginia, and in Russia, and in London.
[00:44:51.457 --> 00:45:05.506]  I mean, people will see men in black uniforms run in, and then they'll beat them to death with a baseball bat, or they'll shoot them five times, or they'll torture them, and the cops come in, and the top bioweapons expert from Fort Detrick who just retired's guts are hanging out all over the walls.
[00:45:06.527 --> 00:45:08.068]  He's got pentagrams carved in his back.
[00:45:08.288 --> 00:45:08.988]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[00:45:09.148 --> 00:45:09.709]  Washington Post.
[00:45:09.729 --> 00:45:10.229]  Just type in...
[00:45:11.236 --> 00:45:17.080]  Former bioweapons expert sacrificed, and you'll get Washington Post, I think that was the article, four years ago.
[00:45:17.561 --> 00:45:18.902]  All kinds of weird M.O.
[00:45:19.022 --> 00:45:19.362]  on this.
[00:45:20.082 --> 00:45:36.094]  There'll be a bioweapons expert down at the university in Houston, and he's in a 10-mile-an-hour zone in the university, and a van jumps the curb, runs over him, backs back over him, and runs back over him with men with masks driving,
[00:45:37.293 --> 00:45:40.237]  And, oh, it was an accidental thing.
[00:45:40.477 --> 00:45:41.558]  That's the type of murders.
[00:45:41.658 --> 00:45:42.299]  Oh, you don't believe me?
[00:45:42.319 --> 00:45:44.021]  Just Houston Chronicle.
[00:45:44.321 --> 00:45:45.343]  There's hundreds of these.
[00:45:45.683 --> 00:45:48.166]  People being killed in airlocks in the head of Fort Detrick.
[00:45:49.979 --> 00:46:01.765]  Another head dying, and then the head of Porton Down dying, and then police said they came up in men in black uniforms and masks, ran away, and then his wrists were slit, no blood at the scene, undigested pills in his stomach.
[00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.627]  Two days before, he told colleagues in Britain and the U.S.
[00:46:04.647 --> 00:46:06.228]  they're going to kill me if I don't shut up.
[00:46:06.528 --> 00:46:08.609]  Then they murder him, and then it's ruled a suicide.
[00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:19.871]  I mean, you can be seen being murdered, your dead body being dumped by men in black uniforms and masks, by police, and it can be in the newspaper, and then it's still ruled a suicide.
[00:46:20.992 --> 00:46:22.593]  Why are they murdering all these people?
[00:46:23.054 --> 00:46:25.636]  Why are they murdering experts in weaponized flu?
[00:46:26.257 --> 00:46:27.078]  Why are they dying?
[00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:29.019]  Because they can trace who made it and who did it.
[00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:32.963]  They were either part of it, or they're experts who can identify who did it.
[00:46:34.935 --> 00:46:58.184]  You see, before you use a super weapon, before you do something, a crime that will make every crime in history pale in significance when added up, all the crimes in history on one side of this new crime that they're preparing, they're laying the foundations right in front of all of us, and they're killing their operatives, they're killing their minions right in front of us with daggers and trucks and guns.
[00:46:59.466 --> 00:47:03.987]  Eyewitnesses drive by and see unmarked police cars pulling over the bioscientist.
[00:47:04.007 --> 00:47:15.930]  They just drive on by, turn into their house up the road, and they're in the local, I remember in the Tennessee paper in one case, and then the doctor, the lady, I forget her name, we interviewed some of her family, she's found out on the creek right there.
[00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.231]  She committed suicide by putting her face in two inches of water and breathing.
[00:47:21.111 --> 00:47:21.631]  Sure.
[00:47:21.651 --> 00:47:24.912]  Of course, she was seen pulled over by the unmarked cars.
[00:47:27.053 --> 00:47:28.113]  Men in suits.
[00:47:28.863 --> 00:47:31.024]  But again, she committed suicide.
[00:47:31.044 --> 00:47:31.704]  That's how you do it.
[00:47:31.744 --> 00:47:35.546]  You stick your face in two inches of water and you suck it down into your lungs.
[00:47:36.406 --> 00:47:37.667]  No one holds you down.
[00:47:37.687 --> 00:47:41.049]  And it's just hundreds of cases.
[00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:42.269]  It's over 200 now.
[00:47:42.289 --> 00:47:43.850]  No big deal.
[00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:44.910]  Everything's fine.
[00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:51.553]  And then some bioweapons experts that are still alive, every few weeks one comes out and says, we've looked at this.
[00:47:51.914 --> 00:47:53.094]  This is genetically engineered.
[00:47:53.134 --> 00:47:55.175]  It looks like it's designed to mutate into humans.
[00:47:55.495 --> 00:47:57.016]  But even when it does mutate,
[00:47:58.864 --> 00:48:00.786]  Right now it's animal to human, not human to human.
[00:48:01.406 --> 00:48:04.409]  It only kills a very low number of those that get it.
[00:48:06.271 --> 00:48:07.412]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:48:07.753 --> 00:48:21.026]  You see, the birds are about to go north from the south, and they're about to migrate into North America, and it's already all over Africa and Asia, and then we're going to have to learn how to live under quarantine.
[00:48:23.896 --> 00:48:33.822]  Now, remember three years ago, the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, they only got a few states to pass it, but they did pass it federally, page 76 of the Homeland Security Legislation in late 2002.
[00:48:35.243 --> 00:48:39.986]  They tried to get the states to pass quarantines, mass roundup programs, mainstream news.
[00:48:40.967 --> 00:48:47.350]  The governor of Colorado said they built big federally funded crematoriums to burn our bodies.
[00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:48.631]  Rocky Mountain News.
[00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:51.253]  That's the Rocky Mountain News website.
[00:48:52.941 --> 00:48:54.341]  Remember that headline?
[00:48:54.381 --> 00:48:55.822]  Governors' Crematoriums Ready?
[00:48:55.922 --> 00:48:56.402]  Remember that?
[00:48:57.382 --> 00:49:04.943]  And they told the police, they told, what was it, 14 million first responders.
[00:49:05.723 --> 00:49:14.845]  All the nurses, all the doctors, all the police, all the firemen, all the EMS, all the government employees, they said, you've got to show up or you won't have a job.
[00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:17.905]  We had police chiefs and sheriffs on and fire chiefs, remember?
[00:49:18.445 --> 00:49:22.206]  We had them all from Arkansas and Florida and New York saying, I'm not taking it, my men aren't taking it.
[00:49:22.975 --> 00:49:24.877]  And then even top scientists said, don't take it.
[00:49:25.197 --> 00:49:27.039]  Remember, it was the smallpox.
[00:49:27.099 --> 00:49:31.462]  Smallpox weaponized, was going to hit us and kill 30% of the population.
[00:49:31.803 --> 00:49:32.884]  It was not a question of if.
[00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:34.785]  It was going to happen.
[00:49:34.825 --> 00:49:36.527]  Remember, the government was saying this.
[00:49:37.528 --> 00:49:38.649]  Yelling fire in a theater.
[00:49:39.169 --> 00:49:42.612]  And the police did the right thing in their guts.
[00:49:42.732 --> 00:49:44.874]  They may go along with the system, but they knew in their guts.
[00:49:45.335 --> 00:49:46.275]  And the doctors knew.
[00:49:46.295 --> 00:49:46.796]  And so 4,000...
[00:49:49.884 --> 00:50:02.313]  Of 14 million, the LA Times reported, by late 2003, a year later, 4,000 had taken it, and the millions and millions hadn't, and it said 99 plus percent refused.
[00:50:02.913 --> 00:50:10.679]  And so suddenly, we didn't hear about that anymore, and they quit pushing it, and then it was the SARS.
[00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:16.952]  And we had quarantines in Dallas and Toronto and just getting us used to it.
[00:50:16.972 --> 00:50:18.413]  Hey, this is how we keep you safe.
[00:50:18.453 --> 00:50:20.994]  And then SARS was going to kill 20% of the population.
[00:50:21.014 --> 00:50:21.174]  Remember?
[00:50:21.214 --> 00:50:21.374]  Remember?
[00:50:21.394 --> 00:50:21.974]  It was going to happen.
[00:50:21.994 --> 00:50:22.754]  It didn't happen.
[00:50:22.794 --> 00:50:24.315]  And now the bird flu.
[00:50:24.335 --> 00:50:27.876]  And then Donald Rumsfeld and Bush and others are making tens of millions apiece.
[00:50:27.896 --> 00:50:29.057]  The company's making billions.
[00:50:29.937 --> 00:50:30.377]  What was it?
[00:50:30.537 --> 00:50:32.938]  It made $6 billion off the Tamiflu.
[00:50:32.958 --> 00:50:35.419]  And then it was admitted that it actually killed people and didn't help them.
[00:50:36.499 --> 00:50:37.700]  So it just goes on.
[00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:44.358]  And on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[00:50:44.938 --> 00:50:51.446]  And so now we're all being trained how to just sit in our houses and wait for orders and die.
[00:50:51.466 --> 00:50:53.349]  Because the bird flu is going to get us.
[00:50:53.389 --> 00:50:54.951]  And see, someday it isn't just going to be a hoax.
[00:50:55.854 --> 00:50:57.055]  Someday it's really going to happen.
[00:50:57.075 --> 00:50:58.617]  And it's going to be man-made.
[00:50:59.157 --> 00:51:01.380]  And if we expose they're doing it, then they won't be able to.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.044]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.244 --> 00:51:10.689]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:11.990]  There is a chance.
[00:51:12.571 --> 00:51:15.173]  To use this disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:15.293 --> 00:51:18.014]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.355 --> 00:51:22.577]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.657 --> 00:51:29.582]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.702 --> 00:51:31.723]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.963 --> 00:51:42.411]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.711 --> 00:51:48.075]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:51:48.576 --> 00:51:51.218]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.990]  I think.
[00:52:22.591 --> 00:52:29.858]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:44.192 --> 00:52:44.573]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:54:02.321 --> 00:54:07.463]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.143 --> 00:54:10.504]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:10.524 --> 00:54:14.766]  All right, we'll go to your calls now.
[00:54:16.633 --> 00:54:17.793]  The bottom line is this.
[00:54:17.913 --> 00:54:37.859]  We better wake up as a people that psychopathic, social Darwinist, Malthusian control freaks, who are into eugenics and domination, are in control of China, North Korea, the U.S., England, Europe, almost every nation in the world, and love them or hate them, despite all their problems, these Muslim nations are not into it.
[00:54:38.939 --> 00:54:41.000]  And boy, they're really going to get exterminated.
[00:54:41.773 --> 00:54:43.634]  And it's been public.
[00:54:43.714 --> 00:54:48.737]  Ariel Sharon, it's been, and Dick Cheney wrote it in that September 2000 Rebuilding America's Defenses document.
[00:54:49.137 --> 00:54:52.819]  He said we need to, quote, legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:55.521]  He said we need to legitimize in the press.
[00:54:55.561 --> 00:54:56.522]  They want to introduce it.
[00:54:56.542 --> 00:55:00.304]  It's like they're introducing torture and warrantless arrest and all this to us.
[00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.985]  He said we need to use our contacts.
[00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:04.566]  Let me go back to the exact quote.
[00:55:04.586 --> 00:55:05.907]  My memory, because I read this so many times.
[00:55:06.519 --> 00:55:15.962]  He said, we need to legitimize through our friends in the press the use of race-specific bioweapons in conflicts in the Middle East.
[00:55:17.503 --> 00:55:21.024]  And then Jane's Weapons Quarterly put out an emergency alert saying, this is insane.
[00:55:21.524 --> 00:55:22.665]  What is Dick Cheney saying?
[00:55:22.685 --> 00:55:23.645]  I mean, that's Jane's.
[00:55:24.005 --> 00:55:24.965]  That isn't Alex Jones.
[00:55:25.006 --> 00:55:26.466]  That's the big Bible of weapons.
[00:55:26.486 --> 00:55:27.646]  They're going, what?
[00:55:28.527 --> 00:55:28.827]  What?
[00:55:28.847 --> 00:55:31.948]  I mean, do you understand what we're talking about here?
[00:55:32.637 --> 00:55:38.059]  We need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons using our friends in the press?
[00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:44.021]  I mean, do you understand the magnitude of what we're talking about?
[00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:46.122]  I'm living in the Twilight Zone here.
[00:55:48.602 --> 00:55:50.283]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois.
[00:55:50.323 --> 00:55:50.983]  Chris, welcome.
[00:55:51.103 --> 00:55:52.504]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:52.704 --> 00:55:58.066]  You know, naturally our government is totally out of control, and we don't believe anything that the press says.
[00:55:59.545 --> 00:56:09.308]  I've been at this for 30 years, ingesting all this stuff, but even, you know, listening to you, sometimes it even gets overwhelming for me, even after 30 years of all this.
[00:56:09.668 --> 00:56:16.591]  But I wanted to know, do you believe that things start by, quote, little things that we tolerate?
[00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:18.431]  Oh yeah, it's incrementalism.
[00:56:19.152 --> 00:56:23.553]  Okay, so that brings me to what I wanted, what's been bothering me for two days.
[00:56:24.374 --> 00:56:28.535]  This, the interview you did with Shane.
[00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:32.741]  I know that you've taken a lot of flack through emails and so on.
[00:56:33.541 --> 00:56:34.081]  Not really.
[00:56:34.101 --> 00:56:36.602]  I mean, I said a minority.
[00:56:37.363 --> 00:56:42.625]  Well, the thing that bothers me and other people that I've talked to is not that you've had him on.
[00:56:42.645 --> 00:56:46.767]  I mean, he's got a right to have a forum, and it's nice that he agrees.
[00:56:47.347 --> 00:56:53.410]  But I think the thing that bothers us more, Alex, is the fact that you kind of pushed his show an awful lot.
[00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:55.551]  And I don't know, did you ever watch his show?
[00:56:55.571 --> 00:56:55.611]  No.
[00:56:56.195 --> 00:56:56.855]  Two and a half minutes.
[00:56:57.235 --> 00:56:58.636]  I think I've seen it like once.
[00:56:58.716 --> 00:57:00.517]  Yeah, well, I've seen it twice.
[00:57:00.557 --> 00:57:01.277]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:57:01.657 --> 00:57:04.899]  I turn it on every once in a while to make sure that, you know, I'm not seeing things.
[00:57:05.199 --> 00:57:07.460]  Because the show is very, very debauched.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.081]  I mean, they promote fornication.
[00:57:10.101 --> 00:57:12.802]  That other show that he had on Spin City.
[00:57:13.122 --> 00:57:15.463]  I mean, open homosexuality and so on.
[00:57:15.784 --> 00:57:18.265]  I think that's what the people were complaining about.
[00:57:18.645 --> 00:57:20.786]  Not that you gave them a forum to speak out.
[00:57:20.846 --> 00:57:21.706]  I understand.
[00:57:22.146 --> 00:57:25.388]  Listen, he's the first big Hollywood star.
[00:57:26.407 --> 00:57:30.108]  And believe me, most of them have seen the videos and know what's going on to go public.
[00:57:30.788 --> 00:57:31.768]  That's why it's important.
[00:57:32.889 --> 00:57:35.629]  I'm not here... No, I'm not saying that.
[00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:39.210]  What I'm saying is... Are you concerned about the bird flu?
[00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:39.890]  Of course.
[00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.551]  But again, things start out little, don't they?
[00:57:42.591 --> 00:57:44.431]  People put themselves in a box.
[00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:46.251]  They give it to you little by little.
[00:57:46.932 --> 00:57:48.432]  And all of a sudden...
[00:57:49.745 --> 00:57:50.906]  You're immune to it anymore.
[00:57:51.426 --> 00:57:51.666]  Sure.
[00:57:51.706 --> 00:57:55.689]  Well, I don't really watch a lot of television, so I have to admit I'm in the dark on some of that stuff.
[00:57:55.929 --> 00:57:57.330]  Yeah, well, it's pretty bad.
[00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.852]  I think that's what people were... That's what's been bothering me, okay?
[00:58:01.093 --> 00:58:01.473]  Okay!
[00:58:01.753 --> 00:58:03.614]  It's not the fact that you gave them a form.
[00:58:03.674 --> 00:58:04.735]  No, I understand, ma'am.
[00:58:04.935 --> 00:58:07.937]  You've said that about three times, and I agree with you.
[00:58:07.957 --> 00:58:08.437]  Anything else?
[00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:09.098]  No, that's it.
[00:58:09.538 --> 00:58:10.759]  Okay, good to hear from you.
[00:58:11.379 --> 00:58:12.540]  I really appreciate your call.
[00:58:13.261 --> 00:58:17.684]  No, I mean, TV itself, movies, I mean, it's just full of all that.
[00:58:19.483 --> 00:58:23.868]  But I know so many conservatives that don't like these TV shows, but they love George Bush.
[00:58:24.628 --> 00:58:26.611]  And they'll make excuses for anything George Bush does.
[00:58:27.211 --> 00:58:32.416]  When he's hugging and rubbing his cheek up against Gannon and squeezing on him and always touching on him in public.
[00:58:32.657 --> 00:58:33.778]  Well, that's a lord.
[00:58:34.799 --> 00:58:36.040]  And it's not really.
[00:58:37.562 --> 00:58:39.504]  All right, we'll come back and start the second hour.
[00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:45.514]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.814 --> 00:58:46.615]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:58.591]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:00.292]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.012 --> 00:59:02.133]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.773 --> 00:59:03.594]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:05.215]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.915 --> 00:59:09.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.098 --> 00:59:14.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.321 --> 00:59:15.662]  Music
[00:59:22.751 --> 00:59:25.654]  All right, now into our number two.
[00:59:25.674 --> 00:59:26.915]  We're talking about bird flu.
[00:59:26.955 --> 00:59:30.598]  The government's saying it's going to come here.
[00:59:30.638 --> 00:59:31.338]  It's going to kill us.
[00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:33.140]  All our freedoms are gone.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.101]  America's over.
[00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:35.862]  They've got many other reasons to do that.
[00:59:35.882 --> 00:59:38.024]  It's just the agenda as the control grid goes into place.
[00:59:39.245 --> 00:59:46.191]  And then some of the other really important news that's going to be coming up is we'll get into New Mexico.
[00:59:46.231 --> 00:59:50.215]  Democrats are voting to call for the impeachment of President Bush.
[00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:55.302]  Also, a North Korean dictator says disabled newborns are killed.
[00:59:55.342 --> 00:59:57.343]  I mean, that's what the dictator is ordering over there.
[00:59:58.283 --> 01:00:02.605]  And the Pentagon is saying they're allowed to plant fake news stories in the press and that that's a good thing.
[01:00:03.905 --> 01:00:06.806]  Really scary report about rights defenders targeted worldwide.
[01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:10.027]  Life of missing China activist is seeking help.
[01:00:10.047 --> 01:00:15.409]  We're going to get into all that and a lot more in some really serious border news concerning the invasion there.
[01:00:15.469 --> 01:00:17.669]  Right now, let's go to Ted in Iowa.
[01:00:17.689 --> 01:00:18.410]  Ted, you're on the air.
[01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:19.470]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:00:20.023 --> 01:00:21.024]  Good.
[01:00:21.244 --> 01:00:24.966]  I had some stuff to talk about, but I actually changed it for your bird flu for today.
[01:00:25.786 --> 01:00:32.670]  One thing I wanted to pop off with right away, Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report came out with the two and a half coolest words I've ever heard.
[01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.551]  The blimmin' Nazi propaganda.
[01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:35.631]  He said that's trademarked.
[01:00:36.912 --> 01:00:41.414]  But I watch a lot of really dry, boring lecture type stuff.
[01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:43.756]  I got Dish Network and I watch UCTV.
[01:00:44.316 --> 01:00:47.818]  Anyway, they were showing like an in-service type video that
[01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.331]  Doctors and nurses and whatnot watch.
[01:00:50.871 --> 01:00:57.895]  And they were saying, you know, first of all, bird-to-bird contact is, bird-to-bird transmission is fairly hard.
[01:00:59.336 --> 01:01:01.497]  Bird-to-human transmission is very hard.
[01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:05.600]  Human-to-human transmission, they said it's next to impossible, don't worry about it.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:16.806]  I watched this other thing the other night, and I caught the last couple minutes of it, and it said roughly two billion, with a B, two billion people around the world would get the bird flu if
[01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:18.597]  Well, I mean, we know that it's a hoax.
[01:01:18.637 --> 01:01:19.278]  SARS was a hoax.
[01:01:19.298 --> 01:01:19.638]  We know that
[01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:46.436]  They told us we were going to be hit by smallpox, remember?
[01:01:46.756 --> 01:01:46.916]  Yeah.
[01:01:47.356 --> 01:01:48.217]  And then it didn't happen.
[01:01:48.837 --> 01:01:51.099]  Because they couldn't get the police and others to take the shots.
[01:01:51.139 --> 01:01:52.560]  The cops said, no way.
[01:01:55.422 --> 01:01:56.202]  Now, why is that?
[01:01:56.222 --> 01:02:01.526]  I mean, the government's saying you're going to be hit, take this shot, and the police and firemen and doctors are like, no, no.
[01:02:02.246 --> 01:02:09.251]  And it's just disinformation over and over for the sheep that are willing to take those little suicide pills, basically, and stuff, and...
[01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:14.783]  No, they were saying, with or without the drugs, you're still 99% likely not to die.
[01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:16.904]  And, you know, just all this different stuff.
[01:02:17.004 --> 01:02:19.425]  And it's just rather disgusting.
[01:02:20.805 --> 01:02:33.690]  One other thing I kind of wanted to just touch base on real quick is, did you know that the company that makes meals for prison found out through changing meals that they can lessen or change the violent behaviors?
[01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:39.172]  Okay, this is important because also, the same company that makes meals for prisons
[01:02:39.611 --> 01:02:41.352]  Makes meals for most of the public schools.
[01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:43.912]  Interesting.
[01:02:44.952 --> 01:02:45.713]  I didn't know that.
[01:02:45.753 --> 01:02:50.894]  I thought public schools had their own food supply systems from different groups.
[01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.094]  Generally, nay.
[01:02:52.675 --> 01:02:53.475]  Well, what were they saying?
[01:02:53.515 --> 01:02:55.735]  What type of diet lowers the aggression in this study?
[01:02:56.236 --> 01:03:01.197]  They were saying changing around their carbs and fruits and these and those and
[01:03:02.463 --> 01:03:05.025]  It was like some Discovery Channel type documentary.
[01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:07.787]  Well, everybody knows a carb diet makes you have sugar crashes.
[01:03:08.187 --> 01:03:08.407]  Right.
[01:03:08.447 --> 01:03:09.368]  And so it makes you irritable.
[01:03:09.408 --> 01:03:10.068]  Is that what they said?
[01:03:10.468 --> 01:03:10.728]  Yeah.
[01:03:11.489 --> 01:03:22.756]  But, you know, they were saying they could pretty easily control if the prisoners had, you know, violent behaviors or whatever, they could simply change their diet.
[01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:25.457]  Okay, well, they're doing the same thing in schools.
[01:03:26.358 --> 01:03:26.458]  Um...
[01:03:27.953 --> 01:03:30.074]  Yeah, we're being social engineered everywhere.
[01:03:30.094 --> 01:03:32.395]  Yeah, why do they have coke machines and candy bar machines?
[01:03:32.995 --> 01:03:36.176]  If they want to have your kids decent at school, they can do it.
[01:03:36.296 --> 01:03:39.917]  Otherwise, they can just screw around with your kids' diets and go, oh, gee, they need medication.
[01:03:39.977 --> 01:03:40.477]  I hear you, sir.
[01:03:40.497 --> 01:03:41.158]  We've got a break.
[01:03:41.198 --> 01:03:41.778]  Thank you for the call.
[01:03:41.798 --> 01:03:44.379]  We'll be right back with more news and your calls on the other side.
[01:03:44.399 --> 01:03:44.459]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:57.744]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.004 --> 01:03:59.585]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.926 --> 01:04:04.610]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.951 --> 01:04:11.697]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.997 --> 01:04:13.979]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.179 --> 01:04:17.041]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.141 --> 01:04:21.785]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.985 --> 01:04:26.388]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:04:55.618 --> 01:04:56.659]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.979 --> 01:04:59.761]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:05:00.041 --> 01:05:04.184]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.624 --> 01:05:05.445]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.765 --> 01:05:10.348]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:12.970]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:14.311]  Sheltering in place.
[01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.485]  We're good to go.
[01:05:40.128 --> 01:05:40.308]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:06:36.769 --> 01:06:39.790]  The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.189 --> 01:07:18.676]  All right, we're open phones today.
[01:07:20.056 --> 01:07:21.617]  Now eight minutes into the second hour.
[01:07:24.218 --> 01:07:29.260]  Let's talk to... Who's up next?
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.861]  I can't ever seem to get my call list right.
[01:07:31.989 --> 01:07:36.132]  Leslie in Virginia, then James and Anita and Tick and others.
[01:07:36.392 --> 01:07:36.752]  Go ahead.
[01:07:36.792 --> 01:07:39.734]  You're on the air, Leslie.
[01:07:39.774 --> 01:07:40.854]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:07:40.894 --> 01:07:45.497]  I was listening to the Grandy and Andy Show on WMAL 630.
[01:07:46.098 --> 01:07:51.181]  It's an affiliate of ABC, and they first introduced the bird flu outbreak.
[01:07:51.281 --> 01:07:56.024]  But your show, this is where the hysteria came in.
[01:07:56.044 --> 01:07:59.866]  I interviewed Shane, and he was totally...
[01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:03.411]  He crossed the line.
[01:08:04.152 --> 01:08:07.396]  He asked if he's an expert on foreign affairs.
[01:08:07.556 --> 01:08:12.342]  I mean, they attacked him from one side to the other.
[01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:12.923]  I'm confused.
[01:08:12.943 --> 01:08:14.365]  We were just talking about bird flu.
[01:08:15.276 --> 01:08:22.499]  Yeah, they told us about the bird flu, we have to do the exercises at the school, blah, blah, blah.
[01:08:22.519 --> 01:08:26.721]  So we've got to learn how to be slaves and give up all our rights to the nice men in black masks with machine guns.
[01:08:27.261 --> 01:08:29.122]  And then they cut into attacking Charlie Sheen?
[01:08:29.322 --> 01:08:29.923]  That's correct.
[01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:31.763]  Now, that's when they went hysterical.
[01:08:32.264 --> 01:08:34.024]  That's when the guns came out.
[01:08:34.485 --> 01:08:41.768]  Because they said that Bush was accused of the towers coming down.
[01:08:42.296 --> 01:08:45.917]  See, I listened to your show and I knew what was false.
[01:08:46.017 --> 01:08:47.178]  I knew what was true.
[01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:52.160]  As you know, Shane asked for an independent investigation.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.021]  He had concerns and questions.
[01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:58.502]  And they were the issues and the facts were brought up.
[01:08:58.882 --> 01:09:04.744]  But they had demonized him and they want to know what CBS is going to do about Charlie Shane.
[01:09:05.405 --> 01:09:09.106]  They want to send a message that Hollywood needs to stay in Hollywood.
[01:09:09.537 --> 01:09:10.677]  You know, what do they know?
[01:09:11.298 --> 01:09:15.780]  Well, the neocons are always trying to bully the media.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:23.083]  They've already bought off most of it and write most of the scripts, and we're all trained how to give up our rights on the different dramas that are on television.
[01:09:23.103 --> 01:09:30.906]  In fact, I heard neocons were even complaining about that Boston Legal piece where...
[01:09:32.026 --> 01:09:36.927]  The lawyer talks about how there are no WMDs found and how we're living in a police state.
[01:09:37.388 --> 01:09:38.488]  They don't like any of that.
[01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:39.808]  They are the minority.
[01:09:39.848 --> 01:09:40.889]  They're not conservatives.
[01:09:41.449 --> 01:09:54.793]  And they want to make everybody else toe the line and be their slaves and ship our kids over Iraq and now Iran and get their arms and legs blown off so they can sit around barking and carping while Bush goes after our guns and tries to get rid of our borders.
[01:09:54.913 --> 01:09:57.493]  So that's what they always do, though.
[01:09:57.973 --> 01:09:59.714]  I guarantee you that show won't have me on.
[01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.811]  To debate them and bring up real points.
[01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:08.712]  What they'll do is build straw men and claim that Sheen and others said things they didn't.
[01:10:09.132 --> 01:10:18.295]  I know they did, and they wanted us to know that the only newspaper that would cover this was a newspaper out of Buffalo, New York.
[01:10:18.855 --> 01:10:24.076]  And, in fact, when Drudge had gotten the information, he immediately took it down off of his site.
[01:10:24.116 --> 01:10:26.657]  Well, yeah, they're reading our news article about the media control.
[01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:31.301]  Right, but I just want you to know they are hysterical about Shane.
[01:10:31.702 --> 01:10:34.763]  Hysterical, and they want to know what Viacom's going to do about it, too.
[01:10:35.324 --> 01:10:37.325]  Senator Redstone, huh?
[01:10:37.365 --> 01:10:42.008]  Yeah, so they're pulling all stops on Shane, and they want to make him...
[01:10:43.244 --> 01:10:47.667]  They want to use Shane as a classical example of what's going to happen.
[01:10:47.687 --> 01:10:48.427]  Well, they're idiots.
[01:10:48.507 --> 01:10:49.908]  All they'll do is get more publicity.
[01:10:50.308 --> 01:10:51.429]  Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:56.932]  We need to be talking and getting and demanding... Well, did you call into the show to confront them?
[01:10:57.112 --> 01:10:58.373]  I want to rebroadcast.
[01:10:58.393 --> 01:11:01.215]  I'm planning to do more than that.
[01:11:01.495 --> 01:11:08.879]  I want to rebroadcast that interview on ABC, their affiliate of ABC, on WMAL, and let the people decide...
[01:11:10.471 --> 01:11:13.912]  What I'm saying is you can just say that here on the air.
[01:11:13.932 --> 01:11:19.033]  You need to call into the show or call into the station manager and say you heard the interview and what they're saying isn't true.
[01:11:19.493 --> 01:11:19.993]  That's correct.
[01:11:20.053 --> 01:11:22.914]  Hey, listen, good to hear from you.
[01:11:22.954 --> 01:11:23.374]  Something else?
[01:11:23.394 --> 01:11:23.574]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.475 --> 01:11:27.175]  Okay, I thought she was saying something else.
[01:11:28.255 --> 01:11:29.696]  All righty then.
[01:11:29.756 --> 01:11:30.556]  Thank you for the call.
[01:11:30.816 --> 01:11:32.296]  Let's talk to James in Maryland.
[01:11:32.336 --> 01:11:33.257]  James, you're on the air.
[01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:34.757]  Hi, I am.
[01:11:35.643 --> 01:11:39.615]  I wonder how many of your listeners are familiar with the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:11:39.715 --> 01:11:42.022]  If they're not, they've been...
[01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:46.872]  Research the Georgia, or do a Google search on the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:11:46.912 --> 01:12:08.222]  Sure, and the reason that's important is we talked about the elite openly saying they want to kill us, and the official UN numbers are 250 to 500 million people to be left, and the Georgia Guidestones, we've tracked back who owns it, and it's the big national Masonic organization, and they have their Ten Commandments, and their Ten Commandments are to kill 95% of us, down to 250 million.
[01:12:08.362 --> 01:12:10.243]  And it actually says that, there's photographs of it,
[01:12:10.763 --> 01:12:19.465]  And it's a stonehenge that's been built there, and on one of the key meridians, they believe in all that mumbo-jumbo, and it says that we must die.
[01:12:20.245 --> 01:12:31.407]  Right, and in that same vein, I was wondering if you would allow me to play a quote from Barbara Marks Hubbard, who is a very influential and powerful woman.
[01:12:32.087 --> 01:12:32.667]  A quote?
[01:12:32.747 --> 01:12:34.468]  Play it from where, sir?
[01:12:35.348 --> 01:12:36.288]  It's a recording.
[01:12:37.017 --> 01:12:41.080]  You know, I'll try it for a few seconds, but if it doesn't sound really good, I'm going to have to cut you off.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:41.680]  Okay, great.
[01:12:42.521 --> 01:12:43.481]  Go ahead and roll it then.
[01:12:46.483 --> 01:12:50.006]  Disturbing comments come from New Age author Barbara Marks Hubbard.
[01:12:50.546 --> 01:13:02.534]  Researchers John Ankerberg and John Weldon report that due to her vast financial wealth and influence among leading world politicians and industrialists, she is having a major impact behind the scenes.
[01:13:02.994 --> 01:13:06.697]  She has been influenced by spirits for almost two decades.
[01:13:08.536 --> 01:13:18.823]  In her book titled Happy Birthday Planet Earth, Hubbard wrote, The choice is, do you wish to become a natural Christ, a universal human, or do you wish to die?
[01:13:19.504 --> 01:13:22.186]  People will either change or die, she says.
[01:13:22.566 --> 01:13:23.467]  That is the choice.
[01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:27.330]  And it goes on, but these are the people we're dealing with.
[01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:30.432]  Well, you're right.
[01:13:30.492 --> 01:13:37.357]  Even John Ronson, who kind of wrote a hit piece on me in his book Them, that's now being made into a major motion picture by Jack Black,
[01:13:39.389 --> 01:13:43.614]  Now his new book agrees with me, and he even said on Coast to Coast AM that I was actually right.
[01:13:43.654 --> 01:13:45.436]  He didn't believe there were really devil worshippers.
[01:13:46.077 --> 01:13:51.723]  Then he went and interviewed the people and discovered that the current head of the Army, and this is public, I mean this is mainstream.
[01:13:53.116 --> 01:13:55.858]  Did all sorts of weird voodoo rituals at Fort Bragg.
[01:13:55.878 --> 01:13:56.919]  Had the troops doing them.
[01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:00.482]  They would have the troops try to kill goats with their mines.
[01:14:01.302 --> 01:14:04.745]  They're into all this crazy stuff.
[01:14:05.386 --> 01:14:10.970]  And then he writes about the 1st Earth Battalion, which I have original copies of it.
[01:14:11.010 --> 01:14:11.631]  Very rare.
[01:14:11.651 --> 01:14:15.934]  And this is where they taught special forces that they serve Lucifer.
[01:14:16.615 --> 01:14:18.196]  And this is the commanders.
[01:14:18.216 --> 01:14:19.818]  The regular special forces aren't taught this.
[01:14:19.858 --> 01:14:21.239]  And they are the army of Lucifer.
[01:14:22.034 --> 01:14:26.597]  Here on Earth, to kill the population.
[01:14:26.757 --> 01:14:30.219]  It's a loving thing that Lucifer, our Lord, demands, they say.
[01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:34.602]  So yeah, that's what she's financing and funding, and they say it over and over again.
[01:14:35.022 --> 01:14:48.350]  In fact, in my book, Ascent of Tyranny, I've got a bunch of big quotes from major magazines and newspapers with head UN envoys and diplomats and industrialists saying, we're going to kill you if you don't swear allegiance to Lucifer.
[01:14:49.105 --> 01:14:54.729]  Have you heard the quote from Prince Charles that he would like to come back as a disease?
[01:14:54.989 --> 01:15:02.174]  Yes, that was in the Associated Press and the BBC and the big German news wire in 1988.
[01:15:03.414 --> 01:15:07.617]  And that's because he released his book, If I Was an Animal, or If I Were an Animal.
[01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:12.360]  And he was out promoting the book, and so they read that quote to him.
[01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:18.284]  He said, I would like to be... Actually, it was Prince Philip.
[01:15:18.976 --> 01:15:20.857]  So let's all keep falling all over ourselves to worship these people.
[01:15:20.877 --> 01:15:24.418]  And we should give lots of money to these groups, and we should just worship and trust the government.
[01:15:47.603 --> 01:15:49.044]  They're going to take good care of us.
[01:15:49.224 --> 01:15:53.527]  I don't know why the cops didn't take the smallpox shots when they were ordered two and a half years ago.
[01:15:53.588 --> 01:15:54.228]  They said no.
[01:15:54.248 --> 01:15:57.250]  I guess now three years ago.
[01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:58.151]  Why did they say no?
[01:15:58.171 --> 01:15:59.032]  The government's so good.
[01:15:59.072 --> 01:16:00.172]  Why did 99% say no?
[01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:17.005]  I'll tell you, the best thing that we can do at this point, besides what we're doing, obviously, the physical things that you're taking part in, is to turn to true worship of the Father and
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.102]  Because these people are about to do these things.
[01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:25.085]  So everybody needs to return, you know, to true worship through our Messiah.
[01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:25.986]  No, you're right.
[01:16:26.226 --> 01:16:29.528]  And we've got billionaires openly saying they're going to kill us.
[01:16:30.509 --> 01:16:32.010]  And they're openly setting it up.
[01:16:32.631 --> 01:16:36.333]  And the average coward just can't face it when it's in their face.
[01:16:37.234 --> 01:16:38.695]  They just cannot deal with it.
[01:16:38.735 --> 01:16:40.997]  And then when they do wake up, it'll be too little, too late.
[01:16:41.077 --> 01:16:42.077]  Unless you wake up now.
[01:16:42.357 --> 01:16:47.241]  Well, it's all coming, so everybody better turn to Yahashua because he's about to come back and...
[01:16:47.699 --> 01:16:49.981]  And it's got to get real bad before he does.
[01:16:50.341 --> 01:16:50.962]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:16:51.002 --> 01:16:54.685]  I've read Revelations, and clearly we go through this.
[01:16:54.826 --> 01:16:59.530]  And it was never taught until 100 years ago with Schofield and others that we didn't.
[01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:02.212]  People thought Hitler was the Antichrist and laid down.
[01:17:02.252 --> 01:17:05.716]  They thought the Christians in Rwanda thought it was the Antichrist.
[01:17:05.776 --> 01:17:11.501]  And we just lay here like little sheep having our guts ripped out by the wolves instead of standing up like the forefathers did.
[01:17:12.313 --> 01:17:15.454]  Or like King David did, and we need to stand up.
[01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:20.476]  As bad as he was, believe me, Hitler and Mao were nothing compared to what's coming.
[01:17:20.496 --> 01:17:24.997]  Yahushua said that no flesh should be saved alive except for the time was shortened.
[01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:26.518]  So it's coming.
[01:17:27.878 --> 01:17:29.318]  You know, I have to agree with you.
[01:17:29.338 --> 01:17:32.459]  I think the timetable is longer than most believe.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:40.582]  But as soon as their grid is in control, and as soon as they do their psychological test and see that enough of them will accept it,
[01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:43.592]  The orderly slaughter of the planet will begin.
[01:17:43.632 --> 01:17:45.273]  Again, I'm just reporting the news here.
[01:17:46.033 --> 01:17:46.634]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:46.674 --> 01:17:47.254]  I appreciate it.
[01:17:48.034 --> 01:17:49.815]  And I'm not trying to scare people.
[01:17:52.357 --> 01:17:54.018]  I have to report to you the news.
[01:17:54.158 --> 01:18:03.963]  I know, we've all got nice lives, and most of us have nice families, beautiful day, so much beauty in the world, so much good, and the highways are set up for us to drive down.
[01:18:03.983 --> 01:18:10.306]  It's kind of like a little rat maze, and we go to our jobs, and everything's there, and we have our routine, and oh, it's not that bad.
[01:18:12.003 --> 01:18:16.686]  I sure hope you're right, but all of my intellect and research shows me the opposite, the cold hard facts.
[01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:26.834]  And then something more important, my guts, my bone marrow, my soul, my instincts, my spirit, my discernment.
[01:18:28.855 --> 01:18:29.175]  I know.
[01:18:30.176 --> 01:18:38.242]  And you out there listening, unless you've been totally blinded and given over to pure evil, you know too, listening right now, servants of this system, you know too.
[01:18:38.402 --> 01:18:38.722]  Why?
[01:18:38.942 --> 01:18:39.723]  Why are you...
[01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:48.807]  Letting this elite mesmerize you and whip you into a frenzy to go along with World War III and World War IV and the New World Order.
[01:18:49.648 --> 01:18:50.068]  Why?
[01:18:50.969 --> 01:18:52.651]  Why are you destroying yourself?
[01:18:56.054 --> 01:18:57.716]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.297 --> 01:19:00.039]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.215 --> 01:19:09.084]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.324 --> 01:19:11.967]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.349]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.509 --> 01:19:16.873]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[01:19:17.273 --> 01:19:17.874]  We're good to go.
[01:19:17.894 --> 01:19:18.154]  I think?
[01:19:34.327 --> 01:19:37.989]  Or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[01:19:38.269 --> 01:19:43.551]  That's www.lasemedinc.com.
[01:19:43.751 --> 01:19:46.633]  Or call LASEMED at 702-953-0267 today.
[01:19:46.673 --> 01:19:49.934]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:03.183 --> 01:20:13.026]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.426 --> 01:20:16.568]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:16.828 --> 01:20:18.668]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:18.968 --> 01:20:21.729]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:24.510]  Here is reality.
[01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:28.452]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:28.932 --> 01:20:32.553]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:33.540]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.727 --> 01:20:57.788]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:19.094]  We're good to go.
[01:21:45.316 --> 01:21:46.277]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:46.297 --> 01:21:47.718]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.354 --> 01:21:54.635]  Nancy McKimson of Jacksonville, Florida says...
[01:22:16.664 --> 01:22:20.208]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:23.691]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[01:22:23.971 --> 01:22:27.515]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[01:22:27.675 --> 01:22:31.138]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[01:22:31.278 --> 01:22:32.540]  I'm really amazed.
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:38.545]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[01:22:38.685 --> 01:22:41.108]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[01:22:41.448 --> 01:22:41.568]  Woo!
[01:22:41.588 --> 01:22:41.668]  Woo!
[01:23:09.846 --> 01:23:11.788]  Let's go to Anita in Mississippi.
[01:23:13.249 --> 01:23:14.790]  Anita, welcome to the airwaves.
[01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:15.911]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:15.931 --> 01:23:16.491]  How are you?
[01:23:16.711 --> 01:23:17.011]  Good.
[01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:20.794]  I have a comment about the lady that called.
[01:23:21.815 --> 01:23:23.676]  First of all, about Mr. Sheen.
[01:23:24.577 --> 01:23:28.119]  All our computers and TVs and radios and iPods, they all have an on and off button.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:35.765]  And secondly, I don't have anything to say about the bird flu, but I did have a question about a comment that was made on yesterday's show.
[01:23:35.965 --> 01:23:36.185]  Sure.
[01:23:36.966 --> 01:23:41.767]  About the lady that called from Arkansas about the GPS system that had been down for four or five days?
[01:23:42.047 --> 01:23:42.347]  Yes.
[01:23:43.047 --> 01:23:44.588]  Did you find out anything about that?
[01:23:44.828 --> 01:23:45.488]  No, I didn't.
[01:23:45.708 --> 01:23:55.210]  She was saying that the person at her work who, I guess, works on the GPS system said the last time that they were all screwing up was right before the invasion three years ago.
[01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:56.110]  Right.
[01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:59.391]  Okay, that's all I had.
[01:23:59.731 --> 01:24:00.051]  Thank you.
[01:24:00.071 --> 01:24:01.851]  I'm sorry I can't answer that question for you.
[01:24:01.871 --> 01:24:02.851]  Perhaps a caller can.
[01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:06.572]  I should have done some research online, but I just ran out of time yesterday.
[01:24:07.955 --> 01:24:08.815]  Let's talk to Tick.
[01:24:08.835 --> 01:24:10.696]  Tick's calling from somewhere in the United States.
[01:24:11.097 --> 01:24:11.817]  Go ahead, Tick.
[01:24:12.377 --> 01:24:13.218]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:24:14.418 --> 01:24:15.439]  Doing the radio broadcast.
[01:24:15.499 --> 01:24:16.700]  What's up with you?
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:18.460]  Doing pretty good, man.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.863]  You're doing a great job, and I hope to be just like you, man, in everything that I can do to help save this country.
[01:24:24.063 --> 01:24:24.604]  Well, good job.
[01:24:24.624 --> 01:24:25.284]  What's on your mind?
[01:24:25.604 --> 01:24:26.965]  I just had a few things I wanted to talk about.
[01:24:26.985 --> 01:24:30.207]  I wanted to touch on your perspectives on the occult.
[01:24:30.267 --> 01:24:34.769]  I mean, of course, thanks to your contributions, we know what's going on with the Bohemian Grove and
[01:24:35.287 --> 01:24:38.949]  We understand what's going on in there.
[01:24:38.969 --> 01:24:45.613]  But one thing that I wanted to mention is that you have a tendency to portray the occult as a bad thing.
[01:24:45.653 --> 01:24:47.694]  I understand that you're a Christian man, and I respect that.
[01:24:48.234 --> 01:24:51.837]  And according to your theology, that's of the devil, and I understand that.
[01:24:52.577 --> 01:24:59.981]  But one thing that I really think that people need to understand is that this isn't only a matter of religious ideology.
[01:25:00.021 --> 01:25:03.103]  This is a matter of esoteric sciences that have been kept
[01:25:03.789 --> 01:25:09.395]  Well, our architecture is all occult designed.
[01:25:09.435 --> 01:25:11.477]  I mean, the whole planet is in the thrall of this.
[01:25:11.497 --> 01:25:12.718]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:13.318 --> 01:25:14.860]  I mean, you know...
[01:25:25.264 --> 01:25:41.549]  The writing is on the wall, so to speak, and the occult is all about the subconscious mind and symbolism and reaching into primal archetypes that, you know, are... If you believe in Campbell's or Jung's cosmology, that's what it's about.
[01:25:42.069 --> 01:25:44.670]  Well, I mean, all you really have to do is just... You don't have to believe in anything.
[01:25:44.690 --> 01:25:48.871]  All you have to do is look at modern marketing to see the symbolism and how it affects us.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.545]  I mean, you know, as far as I'm concerned, that's a fact.
[01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:59.958]  As soon as I hear somebody humming, walking by me down the street, the McDonald's tune, then I know that they're on to something, you see.
[01:26:00.458 --> 01:26:03.003]  And what I wanted people to understand...
[01:26:03.584 --> 01:26:07.146]  Is that this is a power that we can reclaim ourselves.
[01:26:07.206 --> 01:26:08.927]  We can reclaim this power of the mind.
[01:26:09.327 --> 01:26:19.632]  We can reclaim this memetic propensity to change the perspective of people as we see to change that.
[01:26:20.032 --> 01:26:26.695]  And there's always got to be the guardians of the mind for those people out there who just aren't capable or aren't insightful enough to see that.
[01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:29.637]  Sir, influencing anyone is called black magic.
[01:26:30.777 --> 01:26:32.278]  You're not supposed to influence people.
[01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:40.427]  I mean, if you believe in that whole mindset... Well, you know, again... Sir, I just know people who are... Hold on just a second.
[01:26:40.447 --> 01:26:42.209]  Let me just say a few things now.
[01:26:42.969 --> 01:26:44.290]  I know people that are into the occult.
[01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:45.191]  I know what it does.
[01:26:45.251 --> 01:26:46.732]  It leads into really bad stuff.
[01:26:47.073 --> 01:26:51.997]  And there may be really nice people who think that they're all fighting the evil, you know, with their own magic.
[01:26:52.837 --> 01:26:54.679]  And, you know, it's like India.
[01:26:54.779 --> 01:26:56.060]  India believes in all of this.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:56.921]  And look at India.
[01:26:56.941 --> 01:26:57.842]  Look at the fruits of India...
[01:26:58.886 --> 01:27:01.787]  I mean, you had people dying on the street corners and nobody helping them.
[01:27:01.867 --> 01:27:02.488]  Oh, because so what?
[01:27:02.508 --> 01:27:05.069]  They'll be reincarnated next week.
[01:27:05.089 --> 01:27:06.509]  Sir, I look at the fruits.
[01:27:06.549 --> 01:27:14.693]  Look at the fruits of the power that Western civilization, out of the Mosaic Wall, look at all the good fruits it had.
[01:27:14.893 --> 01:27:19.175]  And then, of course, it was hijacked by evil because evil always looks for the biggest, baddest thing to control.
[01:27:19.595 --> 01:27:21.115]  Absolutely, and I understand that.
[01:27:21.396 --> 01:27:24.837]  I guess my point really is I'm not talking about...
[01:27:29.299 --> 01:27:32.721]  Frog toes and eyes of newts and cauldrons and things of that sort.
[01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:37.805]  Really what this comes down to is the power of memetics over people's minds.
[01:27:38.365 --> 01:27:49.092]  And that same tactic can not only control people's minds, but it can also be used to help break the chains that constrain them, you see.
[01:27:49.492 --> 01:27:52.294]  And one of the things that I... You know, the classical...
[01:27:58.175 --> 01:28:00.676]  Books on magic.
[01:28:00.696 --> 01:28:02.856]  500-year-old books, 1,000-year-old books, 100-year-old books.
[01:28:03.216 --> 01:28:08.977]  And 101 is, even if you believe in all that, is you're not supposed to try to influence people.
[01:28:09.177 --> 01:28:13.218]  That's called, let me give you the two words, black magic.
[01:28:13.518 --> 01:28:15.278]  That's what black magic is.
[01:28:16.019 --> 01:28:20.019]  In Star Wars, that's what the dark side does.
[01:28:20.479 --> 01:28:22.900]  They try to control the force.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:25.360]  They try to use the force.
[01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:28.221]  They try to influence people with it.
[01:28:28.241 --> 01:28:28.981]  Thanks for your call.
[01:28:29.301 --> 01:28:30.462]  Again, I don't even believe in that.
[01:28:30.922 --> 01:28:31.682]  It's all a cult.
[01:28:31.702 --> 01:28:39.143]  But, I mean, you just gotta love all these people that think that I'm out there controlling people's minds.
[01:28:39.243 --> 01:28:42.184]  I'm out there firing power beams.
[01:28:44.265 --> 01:28:45.265]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.665 --> 01:28:47.285]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.205 --> 01:28:50.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.392 --> 01:28:54.993]  We're good to go.
[01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:15.307]  We're good to go.
[01:29:35.692 --> 01:29:37.553]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[01:30:54.777 --> 01:30:57.399]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:58.059 --> 01:31:07.043]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[01:31:07.811 --> 01:31:13.294]  From the rebels of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government, prophesied in Revelation chapter 13.
[01:31:14.755 --> 01:31:24.700]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.

[01:32:03.243 --> 01:32:06.245]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:15.431]  Let me run through some news, and then we'll go to...

[01:32:36.677 --> 01:32:40.419]  And before I jump back into that news, we are carrying the citizen rule books.
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.501]  Neocons call it communism.
[01:32:44.281 --> 01:32:45.162]  We call it freedom.
[01:32:46.241 --> 01:32:51.266]  And they hate it, and the FBI has training manuals saying that it's bad and terroristic, and that the Founding Fathers are bad.
[01:32:51.386 --> 01:32:52.787]  We have that in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:32:53.407 --> 01:32:56.930]  Videotape, and then there are actual training manuals with videotape of FEMA teaching it.
[01:32:58.772 --> 01:33:00.914]  And you need to get the citizen rule books.
[01:33:01.054 --> 01:33:13.585]  You can get 75 of them, little 62-page color cover booklet, Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, what jury nullification is, the real power of the jury, the grand jury, a lot of famous quotes by Founding Fathers and others.
[01:33:14.292 --> 01:33:19.295]  Relearn what, I guess many of us have never even learned, what the Constitution and Bill of Rights is.
[01:33:19.355 --> 01:33:20.076]  Discover it.
[01:33:20.656 --> 01:33:22.397]  For many of you who have forgotten it, get it.
[01:33:22.757 --> 01:33:26.960]  You can get 10 copies for $10, and then it just gets less and less the more you order.
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:32.223]  $100 for $75, and give them, you know, let's say you're a teacher.
[01:33:32.947 --> 01:33:33.307]  100 of them.
[01:33:33.327 --> 01:33:38.451]  You can probably get to three or four of your classes for $75, and we're selling it to you at cost there.
[01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:50.620]  And every order, every book order, every DVD order, every book on tape order, every T-shirt order, every bumper sticker order, every order you put with us, we put in two bumper stickers and one of these.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.642]  And on big orders, we put multiple copies of these in.
[01:33:54.548 --> 01:34:02.671]  If you want to understand the occult and how the elite is into the occult, whether you believe in the occult or not, they believe in it, they're engaging in it, you need to get my new film, The Order of Death.
[01:34:02.831 --> 01:34:06.132]  And it's new footage inside Bohemian Grove, shot by an employee last July.
[01:34:07.373 --> 01:34:14.035]  Just amazing footage of the idol and the mock sacrifice, the effigy of a small person, a child they burned.
[01:34:14.821 --> 01:34:23.384]  And then the locals outside, who were mad at me for talking about the occult when I exposed it, they're out there doing their own ritual to battle with the bush inside.
[01:34:23.944 --> 01:34:28.265]  They're out there, and they've got the cauldron out there.
[01:34:28.325 --> 01:34:35.107]  I mean, that's a small part of what's in this film, how the Ku Klux Klan is tied into the Illuminati, and so much more is in this film.
[01:34:35.187 --> 01:34:36.088]  You need to have it.
[01:34:36.368 --> 01:34:42.330]  And then absolutely free on the same DVD, my original Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, updated for 2005.
[01:34:44.196 --> 01:34:47.740]  Brought up to speed with new documents, new photos, new video.
[01:34:48.281 --> 01:34:49.142]  Made even better.
[01:34:49.222 --> 01:34:51.024]  So two films for the price of one.
[01:34:51.064 --> 01:34:58.833]  The Order of Death, Dark Secrets of the Sun, Bohemian Grove combo is available right now.
[01:35:00.257 --> 01:35:06.499]  It is available right now at infowars.com via the SafeSecure online shopping cart.
[01:35:06.899 --> 01:35:10.621]  The film I made last year, Martial Law, which many are saying is my best.
[01:35:11.521 --> 01:35:14.922]  The latest info on how the globalists carried out 9-11, how they did it, why they did it.
[01:35:15.382 --> 01:35:18.683]  And then we get into the police state, the Nazi connections to the Bushes, the occult.
[01:35:19.824 --> 01:35:21.684]  Also at the end of the film, it's a miniseries.
[01:35:21.704 --> 01:35:22.144]  It's three hours long.
[01:35:24.622 --> 01:35:26.563]  And you really get three films for the price of one.
[01:35:26.584 --> 01:35:28.285]  And we've got a lot of big discounts going right now.
[01:35:28.605 --> 01:35:32.648]  So go to InfoWars.com and order those via the safe, secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:35:33.068 --> 01:35:33.989]  Or call toll-free.
[01:35:34.009 --> 01:35:36.170]  They can answer all your questions and take your order over the phone.
[01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:36.991]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:37.711]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:41.514]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv until the end of this month.
[01:35:41.534 --> 01:35:42.935]  Just about eight days left now.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.541]  You get almost half a year, almost half off.
[01:35:56.581 --> 01:36:03.325]  You get 5.3 months free when you sign up for a yearly membership.
[01:36:04.745 --> 01:36:06.206]  So it is a great deal.
[01:36:06.326 --> 01:36:11.208]  All 14 of my films, a bunch of other films and documentaries we've been authorized by their producers to post.
[01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:16.231]  My weekly TV show, video interviews and live interviews in studio every week.
[01:36:17.319 --> 01:36:18.880]  So much is there.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:24.824]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my best audio interviews, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:25.324 --> 01:36:32.068]  And then that funds what we're doing with the other websites and the webmasters and all the free video and audio that we give out that's very expensive.
[01:36:32.748 --> 01:36:36.711]  And so as long as we're breaking even, as long as we can fund what we're doing, I'll keep expanding.
[01:36:37.411 --> 01:36:42.854]  And that's what we've been doing and moving forward briskly to engage the New World Order because we know that they know the time is short.
[01:36:42.914 --> 01:36:45.696]  So go to prisonplanet.tv and get a membership today.
[01:36:46.661 --> 01:36:51.965]  All right, let me launch into some more of the news.
[01:36:52.005 --> 01:37:00.672]  We've already covered bird flu and gotten into the nuclear reactor up just north of New York City, leaking into the river, into the water supply.
[01:37:01.493 --> 01:37:04.195]  Let's get into some other interesting news here.
[01:37:04.215 --> 01:37:09.960]  And again, Ron Paul, a congressman, a Republican, has said anything that weakens this out-of-control executive is good.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:13.863]  If Democrats were doing this right now, what Bush is doing, I'd be for impeachment of them.
[01:37:13.903 --> 01:37:15.284]  I support an impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[01:37:16.198 --> 01:37:18.859]  And New Mexico Democrats call for Bush impeachment.
[01:37:18.879 --> 01:37:22.501]  The New Mexico Democratic Party is calling for President Bush's removal from office.
[01:37:22.561 --> 01:37:32.826]  Party Chairman John Wertham said Tuesday that delegates to Saturday's state party convention supported a call for President Bush's impeachment largely because of...
[01:37:34.051 --> 01:37:36.932]  Perceived abuses of power and corruption in the Bush administration.
[01:37:37.393 --> 01:37:39.634]  The same thing is happening in Vermont and other states right now.
[01:37:39.694 --> 01:37:46.277]  And Ron Paul has said here that he believes that if the Democrats win control of the Congress, that Bush will be impeached.
[01:37:47.197 --> 01:37:48.378]  I don't know if I totally agree with that.
[01:37:48.858 --> 01:37:51.739]  They've got incredible sway over those people with blackmail and payoffs.
[01:37:51.779 --> 01:37:54.781]  But it might happen, and it would be wonderful if it did.
[01:37:54.821 --> 01:37:56.181]  But again, Bush is just a puppet.
[01:37:56.601 --> 01:37:57.502]  We've got to go further.
[01:37:57.522 --> 01:37:59.923]  We've got to arrest David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger and
[01:38:00.595 --> 01:38:05.957]  And George Shultz and James Baker and the real people that have been engaging in all this.
[01:38:06.577 --> 01:38:10.278]  He listed as examples of abuses of power, warrantless wiretapping of U.S.
[01:38:10.298 --> 01:38:10.658]  citizens.
[01:38:10.678 --> 01:38:12.139]  What about having the Army spy on us?
[01:38:12.199 --> 01:38:12.779]  That's even worse.
[01:38:13.379 --> 01:38:17.001]  The misstatement of facts preceding the Iraq invasion.
[01:38:17.781 --> 01:38:24.183]  Well, it's now admitted just from every different angle, their own documents, that they knew there was no WMDs and they staged that.
[01:38:24.967 --> 01:38:32.915]  And the scandal surrounding the indictment of Vice President Dick Cheney's former top aide in connection with the leak of the identity of a covert CIA operative.
[01:38:33.456 --> 01:38:36.299]  Everyone understands that President Bush is not going to be impeached.
[01:38:37.685 --> 01:38:45.210]  Wertheim said, but these abuses of power and corruption in an administration are deeply serious matters that should be more talk about this abuse of power.
[01:38:45.230 --> 01:38:46.170]  I don't know what he's talking about.
[01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:47.131]  It looks like it may happen.
[01:38:47.571 --> 01:39:01.640]  The one-sentence amendment added from the floor of the platform section on political and election reform reads, Resolve that the Democratic Party of New Mexico supports the impeachment of President George Bush and his lawful removal from office.
[01:39:02.324 --> 01:39:03.624]  And I say, yay to that.
[01:39:03.684 --> 01:39:06.465]  I say, hip, hip, hip, hip, hooray!
[01:39:06.625 --> 01:39:07.745]  Hip, hip, hooray!
[01:39:08.425 --> 01:39:09.186]  Huzzah!
[01:39:10.286 --> 01:39:11.806]  All right.
[01:39:12.906 --> 01:39:16.187]  North Korean defectors as disabled newborns are killed.
[01:39:17.267 --> 01:39:21.808]  And I've interviewed aid doctors who work there in the country, and they openly sell body parts in the shops.
[01:39:21.848 --> 01:39:24.969]  They openly beat people's children to death.
[01:39:24.989 --> 01:39:29.450]  They have camps all over the country, slave camps, and there's this little demonic creature there.
[01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:32.359]  The hereditary dictator, his father gave him power.
[01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:35.222]  Always a bad sign when people's children become the leader after them.
[01:39:36.102 --> 01:39:37.363]  And, mmm, like America.
[01:39:38.124 --> 01:39:40.726]  And it's just, this is nothing.
[01:39:40.746 --> 01:39:57.161]  I remember a Vanity Fair article about six years ago admitting that, I guess it was about seven years ago now, they were over there with Madeleine Albright during the Clinton administration and she was all praising it and clapping, getting happy as the slaves did their little gymnastics in front of her at a sports stadium where they do executions the day before.
[01:39:57.927 --> 01:40:02.071]  And how the reporters saw body parts being sold in the shops.
[01:40:02.691 --> 01:40:09.478]  And I talked to that German doctor who worked there for three years and got their highest award from the communist leader for just volunteering and helping everybody.
[01:40:10.258 --> 01:40:17.185]  He was then later, as he became a higher level member of all this, led into these glistening hospitals better than Germany or America.
[01:40:17.205 --> 01:40:19.487]  This was in the New York Times a few years ago.
[01:40:20.405 --> 01:40:22.246]  And it was just incredible state of the art.
[01:40:22.486 --> 01:40:25.787]  And then he was led into elite circles for the military and others.
[01:40:25.867 --> 01:40:29.608]  It was just Colby beef steaks, you know, that are $100 a steak.
[01:40:31.149 --> 01:40:35.350]  Just, by the time it's imported over there, like $30, $40 here.
[01:40:36.131 --> 01:40:39.312]  And just everything.
[01:40:39.412 --> 01:40:45.534]  Servants, prostitutes, money, huge mansions, entertainment, servants.
[01:40:46.721 --> 01:40:48.483]  This is how communists live, folks.
[01:40:49.064 --> 01:40:52.128]  This is what any command and control system does.
[01:40:53.789 --> 01:40:55.031]  And they don't want you to do well.
[01:40:55.051 --> 01:40:56.413]  See, they don't want you to be free.
[01:40:56.813 --> 01:40:58.275]  They enjoy you being slaves.
[01:40:58.395 --> 01:40:59.536]  Freedom makes you a threat.
[01:41:00.778 --> 01:41:06.064]  North Korea has no people with physical disabilities because they are killed almost as soon as they are born.
[01:41:06.144 --> 01:41:06.865]  Same thing with China.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:23.731]  A physician who defected from a communist state said on Wednesday, Rai Quang Chiu, who fled to the South last year, told a forum of rights activists that the practice of killing newborns was widespread, but denied he himself had parted in it.
[01:41:24.289 --> 01:41:33.877]  There are no people with physical defects in North Korea, Rai told members of the New Right Union, which grouped local activists and North Korean refugees.
[01:41:34.337 --> 01:41:38.981]  He said babies with physical disabilities were killed in infancy in hospitals or in their homes and were quickly buried.
[01:41:40.222 --> 01:41:42.604]  The practice is encouraged by the state, Rai said.
[01:41:43.625 --> 01:41:48.286]  As a way of purifying the masses and eliminating people who might be considered different.
[01:41:49.047 --> 01:41:55.948]  You know, I challenge the liberals who have these Planned Parenthoods in all your major cities, always in your minority neighborhoods.
[01:41:57.749 --> 01:42:00.590]  I challenge you to actually go buy books.
[01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:02.490]  Go to a library written by Margaret Sanger.
[01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:04.851]  Just like Margaret Sanger eugenics quotes.
[01:42:05.794 --> 01:42:11.640]  Or human weed quotes into a search engine and then don't believe the quotes online and in journals and in major publications.
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.162]  Just get up off your hind end.
[01:42:13.182 --> 01:42:14.924]  I want you to see it.
[01:42:14.964 --> 01:42:16.665]  I want you to get a book published by her.
[01:42:16.685 --> 01:42:18.007]  I forget the names.
[01:42:18.027 --> 01:42:18.667]  There are several of them.
[01:42:18.687 --> 01:42:19.408]  I've gone and done it.
[01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:25.835]  And I want you to go pull them and I want you to open it where she calls black people human weeds to be exterminated.
[01:42:27.009 --> 01:42:33.454]  And I want you to realize that over 450,000 women in America were forcibly sterilized.
[01:42:33.834 --> 01:42:38.057]  A lot of white women, by the way, for those that don't care, they're telling blacks, sterilizing blacks and Hispanics.
[01:42:39.398 --> 01:42:46.242]  And if a single mother's child made under a B+, they were taken and medical students would cut out their uterus.
[01:42:49.004 --> 01:42:52.467]  A hysterectomy is what it's called.
[01:42:53.527 --> 01:42:54.428]  I've never done that with a...
[01:42:55.309 --> 01:43:01.071]  I did help spade quite a few dogs when I worked for two different vets, but it's a grisly thing.
[01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:02.411]  They spayed the women.
[01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:09.433]  They cut them open, they go into the stomach cavity, and they go in there.
[01:43:09.453 --> 01:43:11.714]  Because I want you to image, this is your government.
[01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:14.534]  This is public.
[01:43:14.554 --> 01:43:15.895]  This has been in major newspapers.
[01:43:16.335 --> 01:43:17.335]  So they've already done this.
[01:43:17.395 --> 01:43:20.856]  Don't think all this stuff isn't going to happen again, because it's already happened.
[01:43:21.368 --> 01:43:24.790]  And again, we get back to the social Darwinistic Malthusian sickos.
[01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:29.132]  And, you know, I tell them, hey, if we all need to die, you line up first, okay?
[01:43:30.853 --> 01:43:47.943]  I mean, set up a big giant meat grinder, you know, a huge garbage disposal, 100 feet tall, with a 20-foot diameter at the top, with giant razor blades spinning in it, and we'll put a diving board on it, and you guys just show us your example first.
[01:43:49.155 --> 01:43:57.901]  Kim Jong-il, the snot-nosed demon, the communist Chinese president, the New World Order, David Rockefeller, all of you.
[01:43:59.562 --> 01:44:08.428]  If it's such a good idea that me and mine die, and I wish you no harm, but if it's so good, then you go do it.
[01:44:09.489 --> 01:44:10.369]  Nobody's stopping you.
[01:44:12.230 --> 01:44:13.131]  Nobody's stopping you.
[01:44:14.454 --> 01:44:15.454]  Nobody's stopping you.
[01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:17.636]  I'm tired of... You know, they've told you it's a right.
[01:44:17.676 --> 01:44:19.616]  They've told you abortion's some wonderful thing.
[01:44:19.877 --> 01:44:21.337]  They've told you it's like a sacrament.
[01:44:21.357 --> 01:44:29.021]  People giggle about it and snicker and talk about how it's wonderful and how it's a woman's liberty and how it's the greatest of all rights.
[01:44:30.081 --> 01:44:40.206]  When the person that pioneered it in America didn't like black people and wanted to kill them and gave awards to Hitler and received awards from Adolf Hitler.
[01:44:40.566 --> 01:44:42.127]  Adolf Hitler loved abortion.
[01:44:46.118 --> 01:44:48.660]  So people just need to realize that.
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:49.820]  You just need to think about that.
[01:44:49.860 --> 01:44:52.381]  Don't get all emotional and send me hate mail.
[01:44:53.142 --> 01:44:56.203]  Just please, please look at what you're part of.
[01:44:57.184 --> 01:45:07.469]  How many women out there know that there are more people wanting to adopt babies each year in the United States and in Western Europe, it's even higher numbers, than there are abortions?
[01:45:07.649 --> 01:45:12.311]  And I've always heard so-called liberals, I've been in debates with them, nobody wants these black babies, Alex.
[01:45:12.772 --> 01:45:13.412]  That's a lie.
[01:45:15.154 --> 01:45:15.875]  That's a lie.
[01:45:15.895 --> 01:45:17.275]  People do want those black babies.
[01:45:17.296 --> 01:45:22.799]  There are Christian families that adopt two, three, four little black retarded babies that I know.
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:25.041]  I don't want to hear it from you.
[01:45:26.222 --> 01:45:28.403]  And there's no excuse to kill those little babies.
[01:45:28.423 --> 01:45:33.347]  And there's no excuse to hop them up on a bunch of Prozac and Ritalin and they die of seizures when they're 12.
[01:45:34.047 --> 01:45:36.128]  What's really bad is how they take little healthy black babies.
[01:45:36.188 --> 01:45:37.209]  It's mainly black babies.
[01:45:38.110 --> 01:45:42.493]  Frankly, because blacks have been more conditioned and enslaved in inner cities under this extermination program.
[01:45:43.465 --> 01:45:47.750]  On the reservations, they found Hispanics will leave the country, Asians will leave the country.
[01:45:48.211 --> 01:45:53.877]  Whites tend, on average, to have more money, but actually it goes blacks, whites, Hispanics, then Asians.
[01:45:54.177 --> 01:45:55.199]  There's even been reports.
[01:45:55.839 --> 01:45:57.481]  The government knows who's easiest to target.
[01:45:57.521 --> 01:45:58.663]  First blacks, then whites.
[01:45:58.883 --> 01:46:01.165]  Whites are real pathetic and decadent and snot-nosed.
[01:46:02.327 --> 01:46:04.069]  Really don't even have the excuses that blacks do.
[01:46:05.328 --> 01:46:05.929]  And these are the numbers.
[01:46:06.069 --> 01:46:10.051]  Blacks have the highest levels of illegitimacy and all the rest of it, by design.
[01:46:10.472 --> 01:46:13.013]  And the men weren't even ever allowed to learn how to read and write.
[01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:15.255]  They were kept out in barns like animals.
[01:46:15.295 --> 01:46:20.498]  And the women were brought in and taught how to speak and control and go out and be foremen and beat the blacks.
[01:46:21.359 --> 01:46:21.639]  Men.
[01:46:21.699 --> 01:46:29.064]  My dad remembers the big black female foreman telling the white people what to do when they were picking cotton when he was a little kid.
[01:46:30.683 --> 01:46:34.026]  Big, gigantic black women stomping around ruling everyone.
[01:46:34.206 --> 01:46:36.288]  You see, this is slave control.
[01:46:36.308 --> 01:46:40.871]  And that's what the Oprah Winfrey's and the rest of them are in this world.
[01:46:41.992 --> 01:46:44.114]  Is they're there to keep us all in line.
[01:46:44.134 --> 01:46:44.595]  I'm sorry.
[01:46:45.075 --> 01:46:51.280]  There's Roman handbooks about how to take the German women and kill the men and then have the women over the children to beat them and enslave them.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:52.601]  They keep the men out in the barn.
[01:46:53.021 --> 01:46:53.682]  It's no different.
[01:46:54.202 --> 01:46:55.463]  They have handbooks on this.
[01:46:56.284 --> 01:46:56.745]  You see.
[01:46:57.785 --> 01:46:59.247]  But why did I go down that trail?
[01:47:00.575 --> 01:47:05.959]  Oh, back to New York's example, I'll use it, there's more news articles on it, probably, I don't know, I've probably seen 50 the last few years.
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:29.839]  They'll come to the black woman, single black woman on welfare, and they'll say, listen, we're going to take the two-year-old, CPS, but if you'll sign the eight-year-old over and agree to medical experiments, totally healthy little happy black boy, or black girl, mainly black boys, so, hundreds of them, in these mainstream news articles in New York alone the last few years, and they take them and they don't just test toxic AIDS drugs on them, the kid doesn't even have AIDS, HIV,
[01:47:30.862 --> 01:47:32.302]  They test pesticide on them.
[01:47:32.322 --> 01:47:37.983]  And I was reading in those New York papers how the first day they give them the first drink and they get sick and vomit and fall all over.
[01:47:38.743 --> 01:47:40.344]  And then the next day they give them more.
[01:47:40.364 --> 01:47:45.184]  And then finally the little boy is passed out in his little bed back there at the research center.
[01:47:45.224 --> 01:47:49.025]  And they come in with a tube down his throat and give him the last dose.
[01:47:49.065 --> 01:47:49.665]  And he dies.
[01:47:49.685 --> 01:47:53.486]  And they take the little black boy and they put him in a pauper's grave.
[01:47:54.226 --> 01:47:55.766]  Just like they cut the uteruses out.
[01:47:55.786 --> 01:47:58.027]  I'm sorry you don't want to hear all this.
[01:47:58.847 --> 01:47:59.947]  These are sick people.
[01:48:00.914 --> 01:48:04.195]  Jesse Jackson isn't going to say a word about murdering those little black children.
[01:48:04.715 --> 01:48:06.175]  It tears my guts out.
[01:48:06.435 --> 01:48:09.136]  Because he's a top-level Mason CFR member.
[01:48:09.576 --> 01:48:14.837]  He doesn't call for pulling down Albert Pike, founder of the Ku Klux Klan statue, right by the Supreme Court building either, does he?
[01:48:15.177 --> 01:48:16.438]  I called his office and asked him to.
[01:48:17.398 --> 01:48:18.918]  Because he's a Judas coat right there.
[01:48:20.159 --> 01:48:22.539]  He was right there when Martin Luther got the gunshots to him.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.140]  You know, it's just so sick.
[01:48:28.297 --> 01:48:35.161]  And they snicker and they talk about how they're going to kill us and they talk about all the things they're going to do to us in their own publications.
[01:48:36.822 --> 01:48:38.743]  And we're too busy watching the bowl game.
[01:48:38.763 --> 01:48:42.225]  We're too busy only caring about ourselves to even save ourselves.
[01:48:45.007 --> 01:48:52.771]  Now the good news is the New World Order are a bunch of lunatics and they're stupid and they're making a lot of mistakes and they're getting more and more exposed and they have less and less credibility.
[01:48:53.332 --> 01:48:54.012]  That's the good news.
[01:48:55.242 --> 01:48:59.665]  And I don't want you driving along bureaucrats, social workers, other people to deny what I'm saying.
[01:48:59.745 --> 01:49:00.986]  I want you to go look it up.
[01:49:01.426 --> 01:49:06.450]  I want you to read as the newspaper makes excuses for murdering black children.
[01:49:08.912 --> 01:49:11.894]  Murdering little defenseless black boys.
[01:49:12.976 --> 01:49:15.418]  I want you to read it before you defend this system.
[01:49:15.478 --> 01:49:19.881]  I don't want you to sit there and snicker and laugh at me or say I'm too negative.
[01:49:19.901 --> 01:49:22.422]  Man, somebody has got to speak up about this.
[01:49:22.462 --> 01:49:25.084]  And it's going on in Florida, Texas, all over the place.
[01:49:27.646 --> 01:49:35.871]  I mean, you think those reports in England where they gave them experimental drugs and they puffed up and their hands and legs busted open and they looked like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man?
[01:49:38.413 --> 01:49:39.394]  They do that all the time.
[01:49:39.414 --> 01:49:41.615]  That's what they do.
[01:49:41.635 --> 01:49:42.476]  They do it with prisoners.
[01:49:43.704 --> 01:49:47.450]  Out in Huntsville, Texas.
[01:49:48.011 --> 01:49:48.972]  Been in the papers out there.
[01:49:49.012 --> 01:49:50.074]  All the jail guards are dying.
[01:49:51.215 --> 01:49:51.436]  Yep.
[01:49:53.988 --> 01:50:00.835]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.136 --> 01:50:02.537]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.717 --> 01:50:04.920]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.162]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.

[01:50:12.708 --> 01:50:16.752]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.992 --> 01:50:18.753]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.833 --> 01:50:29.478]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.638 --> 01:50:31.519]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:52:54.641 --> 01:52:57.383]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:57.403 --> 01:53:01.267]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:10.253]  Why does the government tell the military to go up and spray chemical and biologicals and radiologicals, declassify the American people 3,000 plus times?
[01:53:10.793 --> 01:53:14.393]  To test the troops more than anything, to see if they'll become accustomed to doing it.
[01:53:14.473 --> 01:53:15.934]  Oh, just follow orders, it's a test.
[01:53:17.294 --> 01:53:24.276]  They're like, well, this stuff's marked subterritorial obesity, and they admit it causes spontaneous abortions in all mammal species and hurts the old, young, or infirm.
[01:53:24.556 --> 01:53:27.917]  Well, we're just going to spray it for a solid year over every major city in Oklahoma.
[01:53:28.397 --> 01:53:29.377]  Daily Oklahoma, go read it.
[01:53:30.977 --> 01:53:38.159]  You know, yesterday it was big articles all over the world where China puts ads in newspapers.
[01:53:38.179 --> 01:53:45.020]  Hey, we've got political dissidents' organs, and the Japanese and Americans are flying over there and getting their surgeries and getting it right after they kill them.
[01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:51.061]  And, you know, they kill the dissidents and kill a human, get the body parts and put it in them.
[01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:53.702]  And, oh, I'm sure they deserve to be killed, and the government knew what it was doing.
[01:53:54.871 --> 01:53:55.852]  All of that's going on.
[01:53:55.892 --> 01:53:56.912]  Are you getting an idea?
[01:53:56.952 --> 01:53:59.974]  There is a 6,500,000,000 of us.
[01:54:00.014 --> 01:54:03.416]  We crossed that mark a few months ago.
[01:54:04.197 --> 01:54:06.598]  6,500,000,000 people.
[01:54:06.998 --> 01:54:09.340]  Life is cheap, brother, to the New World Order.
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:12.161]  We are the biggest renewable resource there is.
[01:54:13.502 --> 01:54:14.743]  They're having trouble containing us.
[01:54:14.763 --> 01:54:16.023]  They're having trouble dealing with us.
[01:54:16.544 --> 01:54:18.565]  They want to get rid of us.
[01:54:18.745 --> 01:54:20.486]  There's so many other examples of this.
[01:54:20.546 --> 01:54:23.668]  Now, I do have to commend, if you can commend them,
[01:54:24.586 --> 01:54:25.727]  At least we're having souls.
[01:54:25.827 --> 01:54:28.910]  Why do we know about what happened all over New York State and in New York City?
[01:54:29.791 --> 01:54:32.074]  Predominantly with single black families.
[01:54:32.974 --> 01:54:34.176]  It did happen to some whites, though.
[01:54:34.536 --> 01:54:36.678]  Again, you're not going to get the Mexicans or the Asians to do it.
[01:54:37.499 --> 01:54:41.122]  They're still not totally brainwashed, and they'll do anything to defend their children.
[01:54:41.563 --> 01:54:44.205]  Blacks and whites have been taught to just give them up, especially blacks.
[01:54:44.225 --> 01:54:45.046]  I mean, that's just a fact.
[01:54:46.127 --> 01:54:47.488]  And real black leaders will tell you that.
[01:54:47.749 --> 01:54:48.910]  Tony Brown and others we've had on.
[01:54:50.769 --> 01:54:57.651]  The social workers, when they were handing these kids over to the medical companies to test on them and kill them, the social workers went public and blew the whistle.
[01:54:57.851 --> 01:55:03.373]  I mean, it just tears my guts out to sit here and talk about it.
[01:55:03.453 --> 01:55:08.454]  I don't enjoy sitting here talking about this, focusing on it, thinking about it.
[01:55:08.714 --> 01:55:11.055]  But it's invigorating to know the truth, though.
[01:55:11.095 --> 01:55:11.755]  It's scary.
[01:55:12.295 --> 01:55:15.056]  It's nauseating, but at the same time, aren't you glad you know the truth?
[01:55:15.743 --> 01:55:17.984]  Aren't you glad you know who we're up against, at least?
[01:55:18.044 --> 01:55:22.466]  Imagine going through life before you knew about this, just thinking everything was hunky-dory when it isn't.
[01:55:25.227 --> 01:55:25.867]  Heaven help us.
[01:55:26.187 --> 01:55:27.167]  More news coming up next hour.
[01:55:27.187 --> 01:55:28.148]  There's so much news.
[01:55:28.188 --> 01:55:30.208]  But right now, let's go to Joe in Arkansas.
[01:55:30.549 --> 01:55:31.309]  Joe, thanks for holding.
[01:55:31.329 --> 01:55:32.669]  Okay, Alex.
[01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:36.591]  That fellow was talking about the company that controls the diet of prisoners so that they're less violent.
[01:55:37.071 --> 01:55:37.331]  Yes.
[01:55:37.871 --> 01:55:43.253]  In the spring issue of Range magazine, they published a letter titled, B for Tofu.
[01:55:43.533 --> 01:55:44.274]  It's pretty short.
[01:55:44.294 --> 01:55:44.974]  I'd like to read it to you.
[01:55:45.347 --> 01:55:45.567]  Sure.
[01:55:45.887 --> 01:55:50.470]  He says, I am a retired correctional sergeant from Texas with a day work background before that.
[01:55:51.051 --> 01:56:01.277]  By Texas law, if you feed an inmate beef, you must mix it to the 40% level with soybeans because all soy products convert testosterone into estrogen, making the inmate easier to handle.
[01:56:01.818 --> 01:56:04.259]  They're feminizing us.
[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:08.642]  And soybean doesn't have high levels unless they ground the centers of it.
[01:56:08.662 --> 01:56:13.185]  And it's very toxic for you to do it, and people are slurping it and drinking it.
[01:56:14.013 --> 01:56:16.794]  Well, that must be why they want us to eat a lot of soybeans.
[01:56:16.854 --> 01:56:18.775]  I've noticed they sure have been promoting that.
[01:56:19.235 --> 01:56:22.357]  Big companies, especially like... Send me a copy of that letter.
[01:56:22.397 --> 01:56:23.597]  What was that, Range Magazine?
[01:56:23.858 --> 01:56:24.698]  Range Magazine, yeah.
[01:56:25.098 --> 01:56:25.718]  Tell me more about it.
[01:56:25.738 --> 01:56:26.239]  I'll shut up.
[01:56:26.959 --> 01:56:29.000]  Okay, well, I'll finish reading the letter.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:29.480]  Start over.
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:30.260]  I'll hold you over a minute.
[01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:30.781]  Okay.
[01:56:31.621 --> 01:56:32.862]  You want me to start over with the letter?
[01:56:32.962 --> 01:56:33.442]  Yeah, start over.
[01:56:33.702 --> 01:56:33.882]  Okay.
[01:56:34.342 --> 01:56:37.824]  I am a retired correctional sergeant from Texas with a day work background before that.
[01:56:38.413 --> 01:56:47.602]  By Texas law, if you feed an inmate beef, you must mix it to the 40% level with soybeans because all soy products convert testosterone into estrogen, making the inmates easier to handle.
[01:56:48.082 --> 01:56:51.366]  They will gripe and complain about the things they don't like but never get violent.
[01:56:51.946 --> 01:57:02.136]  China, Japan, Korea, and Samoa have been doing this for over 200 years by promoting tofu and other soy products to their population so that the population gripes about the government but never acts on their gripes.
[01:57:02.679 --> 01:57:08.504]  The Clinton administration passed the law of putting soy in almost everything we eat and signed Ralph A. Kern.
[01:57:09.845 --> 01:57:12.707]  I wasn't aware it was a law, but I heard something about that.
[01:57:13.068 --> 01:57:14.369]  I've got to research that.
[01:57:14.509 --> 01:57:15.169]  That's incredible.
[01:57:15.190 --> 01:57:16.551]  I'm sure you want to comment more on this.
[01:57:16.571 --> 01:57:16.971]  Stay there.
[01:57:16.991 --> 01:57:18.312]  I want to talk more about it.
[01:57:18.873 --> 01:57:21.775]  If that's true, another example of social engineering.
[01:57:21.815 --> 01:57:26.219]  By the way, major studies, I mean big official ones out on soy.
[01:57:26.839 --> 01:57:29.001]  It is very bad for you.
[01:57:30.022 --> 01:57:31.223]  But go ahead and enjoy it.
[01:57:33.763 --> 01:57:38.431]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.334 --> 01:57:50.974]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.634 --> 01:57:52.674]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.394 --> 01:57:54.495]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.175 --> 01:57:55.975]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.735 --> 01:57:57.635]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.296 --> 01:58:01.977]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.477 --> 01:58:06.598]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.698 --> 01:58:10.899]  We were talking about population control.
[01:58:11.059 --> 01:58:14.460]  We know sodium and stannous fluoride is a toxic sedative.
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:15.320]  That's admitted.
[01:58:16.588 --> 01:58:24.694]  Major university studies went back to the 30s, even at the University of Texas at Austin, and it was used in the concentration camps to subdue people and make them docile.
[01:58:24.734 --> 01:58:27.996]  That is an official mainstream World War II history book.
[01:58:28.036 --> 01:58:29.117]  I mean, that is admitted.
[01:58:29.797 --> 01:58:35.201]  And I knew that soybeans have high levels of really strong-acting plant estrogen.
[01:58:37.011 --> 01:58:43.036]  I mean, all plants have a little bit of it, and you're supposed to have some of it, but it's part of the feminization of America.
[01:58:43.236 --> 01:58:51.462]  Most of these products that aren't raw foods have had it added because it's so cheap.
[01:58:51.883 --> 01:58:54.745]  And, of course, Henry Ford was a big pioneer and big believer in soybeans.
[01:58:55.479 --> 01:59:11.788]  And there's some estrogen in the bean hush, but what I've read and heard from farmers and scientists and researchers, I know bodybuilders won't eat it when they're trying to bulk up for a contest and already on steroids themselves because the steroid's already going to break down into estrogen after it's gone through a different process.
[01:59:12.388 --> 01:59:14.709]  So they want to minimize that, that they will not eat soy.
[01:59:15.210 --> 01:59:16.911]  I've read that.
[01:59:16.971 --> 01:59:22.934]  But it's the center of the soybean bean that is almost pure estrogen, and they just crush that and give it to you.
[01:59:24.159 --> 01:59:25.879]  It's caused major problems with babies.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.021]  Remember the rice soy killed a bunch of kids because it didn't have vitamin A and things in it and made them all be screwed up.
[01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:35.322]  I mean, your wife's got mammary glands for a reason, men.
[01:59:35.902 --> 01:59:36.922]  You're supposed to breastfeed.
[01:59:37.543 --> 01:59:41.724]  Even if you've got to work two jobs while she breastfeeds for a year, you've just got to do it.
[01:59:43.924 --> 01:59:45.425]  Babies were born to breastfeed.
[01:59:45.465 --> 01:59:46.825]  Women were born to feed them.
[01:59:46.845 --> 01:59:48.085]  That's what mammary glands are.
[01:59:48.325 --> 01:59:49.386]  That's what makes us mammals.
[01:59:49.426 --> 01:59:50.386]  That's the key factor.
[01:59:51.402 --> 01:59:55.170]  And so he was bringing up a letter in Range Magazine that I'm familiar with.
[01:59:55.190 --> 01:59:55.992]  I didn't see the letter.
[01:59:57.127 --> 01:59:59.128]  But we are sent up by listeners.
[01:59:59.749 --> 02:00:06.513]  What issue was that where the correction officer is saying that it's well known that they feed the prisoners soy to make them docile?
[02:00:06.553 --> 02:00:09.154]  I know the school lunch program, they feed them a lot of soy.
[02:00:09.474 --> 02:00:16.978]  So if you wonder why your 14-year-old or 15-year-old son starts wanting to date Billy instead of Jenny, that's another big reason.
[02:00:17.018 --> 02:00:22.842]  Studies show you feed high levels of soy filled with estrogen to young males, it feminizes them.
[02:00:22.862 --> 02:00:23.162]  Go ahead.
[02:00:23.894 --> 02:00:27.657]  Okay, the issue of the Range Magazine that it's in is Spring 2006, the latest issue.
[02:00:28.238 --> 02:00:39.707]  And I've lived on almost all raw food for a long time now, and I don't eat any soybeans because what I found out is that if you soak soybeans so that you can eat them raw, you don't want to eat many of them, maybe one or two, and then they start to taste bad.
[02:00:39.727 --> 02:00:44.190]  So I figure anything that you don't enjoy in its most raw and natural state is not something good for you.
[02:00:46.452 --> 02:00:48.054]  No, I like soybeans.
[02:00:48.494 --> 02:00:52.897]  I go to every once in a while a sushi place that has them, but it would be like one or two beans, and you pop them open and eat them.
[02:00:53.886 --> 02:00:55.447]  I mean, a little bit of estrogen isn't going to hurt you.
[02:00:55.467 --> 02:01:02.690]  But, yeah, when your diet's like when half your vegetable intake is soy, which it is for a lot of Americans, and these hamburgers and stuff that aren't real beef, they're part soy.
[02:01:03.190 --> 02:01:04.791]  But you're a farmer.
[02:01:04.811 --> 02:01:05.591]  You've called before.
[02:01:05.611 --> 02:01:10.513]  I mean, are you familiar with what I've read, that it's the middle of the soybean that's really bad?
[02:01:10.533 --> 02:01:12.814]  Actually, I'm just a part-time gardener.
[02:01:12.854 --> 02:01:13.535]  I'm not a farmer.
[02:01:13.815 --> 02:01:16.096]  I really don't know specifically all that much.
[02:01:16.116 --> 02:01:19.437]  Well, I've just heard you call the show about organic gardening and farming, I guess.
[02:01:19.577 --> 02:01:20.878]  Maybe my memory doesn't serve me.
[02:01:22.854 --> 02:01:24.535]  I haven't called your show all that much over the years.
[02:01:25.076 --> 02:01:27.377]  I've called a couple of times before, but it's been a long time.
[02:01:27.397 --> 02:01:28.497]  Do you call other shows, sir?
[02:01:29.098 --> 02:01:31.159]  Yeah, I call the Power Hour quite often.
[02:01:31.179 --> 02:01:32.499]  I am very interested in farming and gardening.
[02:01:32.639 --> 02:01:34.500]  And then you also call other shows, right?
[02:01:35.241 --> 02:01:42.424]  Because I've heard you talk about it, or perhaps you've researched farming, because I've heard you talk about it.
[02:01:42.845 --> 02:01:44.565]  Well, I'm always trying to learn more about gardening.
[02:01:44.585 --> 02:01:47.367]  Because every time I hear you call in, it's about farming, is my point.
[02:01:47.907 --> 02:01:49.168]  I wasn't trying to mislead anybody.
[02:01:49.908 --> 02:01:51.609]  Yeah, it is a big subject of interest to me.
[02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:55.813]  So I am correct that I hear you calling and talking about farming most of the time?
[02:01:56.793 --> 02:01:58.375]  That's one of the subjects I'm interested in talking about.
[02:01:58.395 --> 02:01:58.595]  Okay, cool.
[02:01:58.635 --> 02:02:00.156]  I'm trying to make sure I'm not going crazy here.
[02:02:00.236 --> 02:02:01.097]  Yeah, okay, okay.
[02:02:01.197 --> 02:02:03.939]  Listen, I'm not cornering you and trying to interrogate.
[02:02:03.959 --> 02:02:05.600]  I'm trying to find out if my memory's working.
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:06.921]  Yeah, your memory's working.
[02:02:06.961 --> 02:02:07.821]  What you say is reasonable.
[02:02:08.002 --> 02:02:09.463]  That is a subject I often talk about.
[02:02:09.523 --> 02:02:13.666]  Okay, I was thinking, God, I was thinking, man, if I'm not right about this, I'm really losing it.
[02:02:14.867 --> 02:02:15.227]  No, no.
[02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:17.301]  No, your memory's okay.
[02:02:17.381 --> 02:02:17.761]  All right.
[02:02:18.222 --> 02:02:21.584]  Well, that's interesting, and I'll try to find out more about soybeans.
[02:02:21.744 --> 02:02:23.525]  I've just read it so many places, heard it, seen it.
[02:02:24.065 --> 02:02:26.887]  And now even the health food stores will tell you, don't eat too much soy.
[02:02:26.907 --> 02:02:30.229]  They were real big on it ten years ago, but they're now finding out.
[02:02:30.329 --> 02:02:37.873]  Or there's the good soy that's just the meat of the bean, not the core.
[02:02:38.674 --> 02:02:41.055]  You do not want the hard core of the bean.
[02:02:41.095 --> 02:02:43.517]  It's almost pure plant estrogen.
[02:02:47.122 --> 02:02:49.965]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.225 --> 02:02:50.926]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:51.026 --> 02:02:51.807]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.147 --> 02:02:56.832]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.172 --> 02:03:03.919]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:04.219 --> 02:03:06.201]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.421 --> 02:03:09.243]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.343 --> 02:03:14.006]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.207 --> 02:03:18.610]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:26.096]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.336 --> 02:03:28.758]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:46.244 --> 02:03:49.506]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.586 --> 02:03:53.749]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:54.010 --> 02:03:56.792]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.992 --> 02:03:59.394]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:59.574 --> 02:04:08.240]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:08.420 --> 02:04:09.761]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:09.961 --> 02:04:14.104]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[02:04:14.104 --> 02:04:14.624]  We're good to go.
[02:04:33.376 --> 02:04:34.417]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.587 --> 02:04:48.929]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:51.231]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:51.371 --> 02:04:58.496]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:04:58.696 --> 02:05:07.223]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:05:07.583 --> 02:05:12.267]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:05:12.427 --> 02:05:16.470]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[02:05:16.670 --> 02:05:19.111]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[02:05:19.272 --> 02:05:23.635]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:05:26.897 --> 02:05:28.578]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calvinpuresoap.com.
[02:05:28.778 --> 02:05:30.960]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:05:46.744 --> 02:05:52.368]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.468 --> 02:06:03.256]  I want to cover some news a little bit right back to your calls.
[02:06:05.058 --> 02:06:11.342]  No breach seen in work in Iraq on propaganda, that's out of the New York Times, concerning fake newspaper articles.
[02:06:12.543 --> 02:06:15.986]  Also, rights defenders targeted worldwide report says, that out of Reuters.
[02:06:16.946 --> 02:06:19.647]  Wife of missing China activist seeks help.
[02:06:19.687 --> 02:06:22.288]  We're only hearing about him from the liberals because he's an AIDS activist.
[02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:27.649]  We could care less about somebody they claim shoplifted as they walk them outside and blow their head off.
[02:06:28.630 --> 02:06:32.031]  Clark calls for a rethink on how terrorists are tried.
[02:06:32.211 --> 02:06:35.352]  Over in England, they're calling for getting rid of any type of due process or juries.
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:39.601]  Neonazis threaten to massacre Muslims at World Cup.
[02:06:39.641 --> 02:06:40.942]  Boy, that sounds like a staged event.
[02:06:41.282 --> 02:06:43.703]  New York City's crime fight to get more eyes.
[02:06:43.763 --> 02:06:45.044]  Surveillance cameras to watch you.
[02:06:45.344 --> 02:06:47.325]  See, all those cameras they claim were for traffic?
[02:06:47.605 --> 02:06:47.965]  No.
[02:06:48.305 --> 02:06:51.106]  The federal grants were to watch you and control you all along.
[02:06:51.666 --> 02:06:54.027]  Abu Ghraib dog handler is unrepentant.
[02:06:55.068 --> 02:06:57.889]  Also, Iraqi residents say bodies in video from U.S.
[02:06:58.049 --> 02:06:58.469]  raid.
[02:06:58.529 --> 02:07:00.870]  Now the evidence is coming out that there are just huge massacres.
[02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:05.332]  See, what the Nazis would do in Poland and in Russia and other areas, they went into town...
[02:07:06.189 --> 02:07:10.011]  And one individual out of a city of 50,000 shot at them.
[02:07:11.371 --> 02:07:14.032]  If it was a private, they'd kill about 20 people.
[02:07:14.253 --> 02:07:16.373]  And there were different cases, but you can go look it up.
[02:07:16.894 --> 02:07:20.195]  But if an SS officer got killed, they might kill 1,000 people.
[02:07:21.576 --> 02:07:29.359]  And they would just herd everybody into a big church and then just drive tanks up in front of them with machine guns and their cannons and just blow the whole thing up or pour gasoline on it.
[02:07:29.979 --> 02:07:33.981]  And that's basically what our illustrious troops are doing over there.
[02:07:35.604 --> 02:07:37.305]  And everybody's going, well, is it true?
[02:07:37.385 --> 02:07:38.986]  Why, the Iraqi police say so.
[02:07:39.046 --> 02:07:39.706]  Who knows?
[02:07:40.026 --> 02:07:41.027]  Is it an exaggeration?
[02:07:41.727 --> 02:07:47.430]  I read articles back at the start of the war where reporters are right there with the troops and they're shooting women for fun.
[02:07:48.831 --> 02:07:50.091]  Don't you talk about our troops that way.
[02:07:50.672 --> 02:07:51.652]  Well, they need to kill them.
[02:07:52.793 --> 02:07:54.814]  Hey, this is going on and it's shameful, okay?
[02:07:59.976 --> 02:08:01.417]  We need to get out of denial about this.
[02:08:01.977 --> 02:08:04.719]  And then Bush rules out amnesty for undocumented workers.
[02:08:04.739 --> 02:08:05.159]  I want to
[02:08:06.038 --> 02:08:12.101]  I want to start with that here in just a moment, but I've got really bad allergies right now.
[02:08:12.141 --> 02:08:13.502]  Sorry if I keep sniffling and hacking.
[02:08:14.682 --> 02:08:26.288]  Before I do that, though, I want to tell you about this, our sponsor, who I've been using for two years before they became a sponsor a few months ago, and they've been a sponsor on the network for, I don't know, five, six years.
[02:08:26.848 --> 02:08:28.749]  They've been around for 59 years.
[02:08:29.309 --> 02:08:31.450]  In one year, it would have been 60 years.
[02:08:32.531 --> 02:08:32.891]  They were...
[02:08:33.864 --> 02:08:35.444]  Founded back in 1947.
[02:08:37.345 --> 02:08:39.205]  Calbin Pure Soap.
[02:08:39.626 --> 02:08:41.546]  Calbin five-star soap products.
[02:08:41.586 --> 02:08:43.026]  The Calbin Soap Company.
[02:08:44.307 --> 02:08:47.467]  And call and get one of their beautiful free catalogs.
[02:08:49.108 --> 02:08:51.268]  Call right now and get a free catalog.
[02:08:51.288 --> 02:09:01.871]  Or get the little $14 sampler pack with shampoo, a bunch of bars of their soap, dishwasher soap, clothes, soap for your clothes, washers, your laundry.
[02:09:02.621 --> 02:09:05.284]  I mean, I forget how many pounds it weighs.
[02:09:05.924 --> 02:09:08.266]  It's a big tote bag, and it's $14.
[02:09:08.406 --> 02:09:13.091]  I mean, one or two products would cost that at the grocery store.
[02:09:13.111 --> 02:09:17.815]  And you save 85% off because they're factory direct, and they've done the studies.
[02:09:17.835 --> 02:09:20.397]  85% off compared to what people pay for toxic chemicals at the store.
[02:09:21.798 --> 02:09:24.741]  And, you know, in the past, if I left a little bit of zest under my arms or,
[02:09:26.039 --> 02:09:31.124]  You know, between my legs, wherever, you know, where you wash with soap, it'd burn you, and you'd get a rash.
[02:09:31.144 --> 02:09:31.744]  Oh, that hurts.
[02:09:31.764 --> 02:09:33.546]  I gotta, you know, oh, I got soap down there.
[02:09:33.566 --> 02:09:36.790]  Or I got soap under my arms, or soap behind my ears.
[02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:43.376]  Not with Calvin Pure Soap, because I have a tendency to get all lathered up and not spray it all off in the shower, as I know a lot of you do.
[02:09:43.957 --> 02:09:45.418]  This stuff just smells so good.
[02:09:45.438 --> 02:09:48.782]  I mean, they were organic before organic was even, you know, being discussed.
[02:09:50.066 --> 02:09:54.470]  It was, I guess, in the 40s, stuff was already organic, then it shifted out of being organic right around that time.
[02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:56.853]  So they're just amazing folks.
[02:09:57.033 --> 02:09:58.034]  Get a free catalog, 800-340-7091, 1-800-340-7091.
[02:09:58.094 --> 02:09:59.355]  Write that number down.
[02:09:59.415 --> 02:10:01.217]  Call and get the free catalog.
[02:10:01.277 --> 02:10:04.320]  We're going to get a year's supply of soap, a month's supply, or the $14 tote bag, 1-800-340-7091.
[02:10:15.769 --> 02:10:19.250]  Or check them out online at CalBenPureSoap.com.
[02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:22.331]  That's C-A-L-B-E-N PureSoap.com.
[02:10:22.351 --> 02:10:23.091]  Just Cal Ben.
[02:10:23.131 --> 02:10:24.311]  California Pure Soap Company.
[02:10:25.012 --> 02:10:28.673]  It is the Cal Ben Pure Soap Company.
[02:10:28.713 --> 02:10:29.973]  CalBenPureSoap.com.
[02:10:29.993 --> 02:10:34.434]  Or if you missed that, there's a banner on the left-hand side of InfoWars.com.
[02:10:35.314 --> 02:10:36.875]  And I forgot to tell Paul Watson this.
[02:10:36.915 --> 02:10:37.855]  Paul, put a banner up for them.
[02:10:37.875 --> 02:10:42.576]  I'm going to put a banner up on Prison Planet for these fine folks as well.
[02:10:43.417 --> 02:10:43.797]  All right.
[02:10:45.905 --> 02:10:46.825]  I've been ranting so much.
[02:10:46.845 --> 02:10:48.366]  Let's just take some calls and I'll get into this.
[02:10:48.926 --> 02:10:51.907]  Bush rules out amnesty for undocumented workers.
[02:10:53.307 --> 02:10:55.228]  Such deception.
[02:10:56.188 --> 02:10:58.689]  I mean, that is a bald-faced lie.
[02:10:59.749 --> 02:11:01.210]  But first, let's just go back to the calls.
[02:11:03.010 --> 02:11:07.572]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in New Mexico.
[02:11:07.632 --> 02:11:08.392]  Dan, thanks for holding.
[02:11:08.852 --> 02:11:10.292]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[02:11:11.333 --> 02:11:15.014]  I'm just real recent to the...
[02:11:16.607 --> 02:11:17.788]  Truth movement, if you will.
[02:11:18.348 --> 02:11:23.110]  I had seen something on our public access.
[02:11:24.191 --> 02:11:27.272]  I think it was Not Loose Change, but the other one.
[02:11:28.593 --> 02:11:29.934]  Anywho... There was a whole bunch.
[02:11:29.994 --> 02:11:32.355]  I mean, was it many of my films, or was it plain sight?
[02:11:32.935 --> 02:11:33.475]  Plain sight.
[02:11:33.615 --> 02:11:34.556]  That's what it had to be.
[02:11:35.096 --> 02:11:35.456]  Yeah.
[02:11:35.817 --> 02:11:44.101]  And so I started surfing and looking, and one sight called you a liar, and that's what...
[02:11:45.836 --> 02:11:48.397]  Got me to find your site when I found it.
[02:11:48.477 --> 02:11:50.278]  Oh, yeah, no, no, the enemy attacks only help.
[02:11:50.398 --> 02:11:51.738]  I always appreciate it.
[02:11:51.778 --> 02:12:08.865]  They do, because, you know, I just kept looking for unbiased and not, you know, it's obvious to me now that the bubbles and the, you know, a lot of the plane stories, it's...
[02:12:12.409 --> 02:12:17.832]  Just to get people to look other than at the obvious, which is the rate they fell.
[02:12:20.093 --> 02:12:34.900]  You know, and so, and then, you know, I can remember, oh, back 10 years ago or so, I'm just sitting in a work truck and I'm listening to talk radio, which I don't do very often.
[02:12:36.074 --> 02:12:53.322]  And a fellow from here, because we have government labs here, that's the primary industry in this state, talked about the Oklahoma City and how there's no way that a truck bomb took out concrete columns.
[02:12:54.082 --> 02:12:55.123]  Well, it's not just that.
[02:12:55.223 --> 02:13:03.767]  The local police and the FBI admit the BATF was on site within 30 seconds in full bomb gear and told the police, we were told not to come into work today and none of them were in the building.
[02:13:04.187 --> 02:13:09.629]  Then they told one of the doctors on the scene, patch us up, claim we were in there.
[02:13:10.070 --> 02:13:12.491]  And the doctor said no, so he was found dead a few days later.
[02:13:12.511 --> 02:13:13.891]  They murdered him.
[02:13:14.772 --> 02:13:17.113]  And they're just, they are the scum of the earth.
[02:13:17.173 --> 02:13:18.814]  I mean, they are dangerous gangsters.
[02:13:18.854 --> 02:13:20.234]  They are hardcore.
[02:13:20.995 --> 02:13:21.775]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13:21.855 --> 02:13:23.676]  So, like I say, I'm new...
[02:13:24.346 --> 02:13:28.648]  I probably... I just subscribed to Prison Planet three days ago.
[02:13:29.509 --> 02:13:34.991]  And I've got a heck of a lot of, you know, videos to watch, stuff to read, of course.
[02:13:35.111 --> 02:13:44.256]  But I have seen, of course, Bohemian Grove, because that was available before I subscribed.
[02:13:44.536 --> 02:13:48.258]  And Loose Change was available.
[02:13:48.358 --> 02:13:51.520]  But I much, much preferred your...
[02:13:54.026 --> 02:13:57.087]  I just watched the follow-up to it yesterday.
[02:13:58.227 --> 02:13:58.927]  Martial Law?
[02:13:59.587 --> 02:14:02.648]  No, Martial Law was available on the Internet as well.
[02:14:02.748 --> 02:14:03.368]  Order of Death?
[02:14:04.248 --> 02:14:07.189]  No, your 9-1-1... Road to Tyranny.
[02:14:07.569 --> 02:14:08.670]  Road to Tyranny.
[02:14:08.690 --> 02:14:10.630]  The original, out four months after 9-11.
[02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:12.710]  Yeah, yeah, and the follow-up.
[02:14:13.271 --> 02:14:19.872]  And see, I've got my mom right here, captive audience, but she won't, she can't look at this.
[02:14:20.312 --> 02:14:21.953]  You know, it's too much for...
[02:14:23.772 --> 02:14:28.094]  Well, that's why they're going to lose everything they've got and lose their freedom.
[02:14:51.713 --> 02:15:11.137]  Well, I mean, it was, I saw... You know what, instead of 9-11, go get the New York Daily News articles about them killing little black boys with pesticide, strapped down, and then go, hey, the government does this, or get them the Jerusalem Post about 110,000 Jewish children strapped down and hit with radiation and then being killed.
[02:15:12.217 --> 02:15:12.798]  Because the U.S.
[02:15:12.818 --> 02:15:20.183]  government gave them $3 billion to do it, quote, testing, and go, let me see, they killed 110,000, or the 110,000, most of them did die.
[02:15:20.984 --> 02:15:23.746]  The majority of them, I think it was like 75,000, died within a few months.
[02:15:23.766 --> 02:15:25.727]  So they'll go, hey, they murdered little kids.
[02:15:26.007 --> 02:15:27.829]  Do they kill people on 9-11?
[02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:31.211]  Oh, well, you know... You know, hit them with that kind of stuff.
[02:15:31.692 --> 02:15:33.653]  Yeah, that's great.
[02:15:33.813 --> 02:15:38.837]  Most people, you know, they just, they won't look at anything.
[02:15:39.637 --> 02:15:39.798]  And...
[02:15:41.325 --> 02:15:44.507]  I saw your thing with George, Mr. Humphrey.
[02:15:45.068 --> 02:15:45.308]  Yes.
[02:15:45.568 --> 02:15:47.389]  And I watched his video this morning.
[02:15:49.370 --> 02:15:56.574]  And that's a little gentler for some of the people that won't look.
[02:15:57.395 --> 02:16:06.721]  But, you know, your follow-up to your 9-11, which I trust you did your follow-up recently within the past year.
[02:16:06.741 --> 02:16:08.882]  Yeah, it's called martial law.
[02:16:10.969 --> 02:16:17.994]  Yeah, martial law is too much for these people I'm speaking with.
[02:16:18.514 --> 02:16:26.680]  But, you know, I'll look for and find a group and start a group, because that's what you and George say you've got to work at.
[02:16:27.801 --> 02:16:28.541]  We've got to do it.
[02:16:28.601 --> 02:16:32.644]  I mean, these poor people are in denial about what's happening, and it's our responsibility.
[02:16:33.365 --> 02:16:37.328]  Who was it, to paraphrase Barry Goldwater...
[02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:41.324]  You know, in politics, silence isn't golden, it's yellow.
[02:16:43.645 --> 02:16:45.406]  Yeah, it's, well, you know.
[02:16:46.586 --> 02:16:49.007]  I've got quite a few questions.
[02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:50.588]  Well, we're almost out of time.
[02:16:50.688 --> 02:16:53.469]  I've got to get to other people and cover news, but go ahead and fire out one more.
[02:16:54.029 --> 02:16:55.510]  Okay.
[02:16:55.530 --> 02:16:58.711]  My nephew was just...
[02:16:59.227 --> 02:17:01.289]  Served six months in California.
[02:17:01.449 --> 02:17:06.333]  Is it likely that he's implanted with one of the... No.
[02:17:06.893 --> 02:17:13.518]  Reuters reported that two years ago, Applied Digital signed a deal with Bureau of Prisons, but then the public backlash, it was canceled.
[02:17:14.139 --> 02:17:17.401]  There are plans to start implanting prisoners with chips.
[02:17:17.421 --> 02:17:19.403]  They've made the Mexican Attorney General's employees do it.
[02:17:19.443 --> 02:17:20.624]  Some companies are trying it here.
[02:17:21.805 --> 02:17:22.285]  But no.
[02:17:23.206 --> 02:17:23.526]  Oh, good.
[02:17:23.746 --> 02:17:25.087]  Well, that helps a lot.
[02:17:25.668 --> 02:17:25.908]  All right.
[02:17:25.948 --> 02:17:26.408]  Thank you, sir.
[02:17:26.428 --> 02:17:27.249]  I appreciate the call.
[02:17:28.826 --> 02:17:30.667]  Yeah, they just keep saying, chips, chips, you need chips.
[02:17:30.707 --> 02:17:31.228]  Chips are good.
[02:17:31.288 --> 02:17:31.828]  Chips are good.
[02:17:31.868 --> 02:17:32.869]  We need to chip all the animals.
[02:17:32.909 --> 02:17:33.550]  Chips, chips, chips.
[02:17:33.570 --> 02:17:34.310]  Chips will keep you safe.
[02:17:34.690 --> 02:17:35.691]  Chips will keep the kids safe.
[02:17:35.731 --> 02:17:36.412]  Chips, chips, chips.
[02:17:36.752 --> 02:17:39.614]  They keep wearing us down, and we're like, okay, we expect it.
[02:17:39.774 --> 02:17:40.895]  Okay, give me my chip.
[02:17:40.915 --> 02:17:42.836]  Been hearing about it for 10 years.
[02:17:42.896 --> 02:17:43.477]  Give me my chip.
[02:17:46.821 --> 02:17:49.825]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:17:50.165 --> 02:17:58.995]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:17:59.315 --> 02:18:04.001]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:18:04.461 --> 02:18:11.163]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:18:11.563 --> 02:18:23.347]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:23.827 --> 02:18:28.290]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:18:28.450 --> 02:18:30.791]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:30.811 --> 02:18:32.772]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:18:32.792 --> 02:18:33.993]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.053 --> 02:18:35.514]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:35.534 --> 02:18:36.594]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.899 --> 02:18:46.679]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:46.739 --> 02:18:47.179]  One and the same.
[02:18:47.199 --> 02:18:51.941]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:51.961 --> 02:18:54.302]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:54.322 --> 02:18:55.682]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:55.722 --> 02:18:56.842]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:15.956 --> 02:19:16.396]  We're good to go.
[02:19:16.476 --> 02:19:17.577]  We're good to go.
[02:19:46.896 --> 02:19:49.358]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.858 --> 02:19:56.641]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[02:19:57.222 --> 02:20:07.127]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[02:20:07.827 --> 02:20:14.011]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[02:20:14.731 --> 02:20:22.693]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:43.982 --> 02:20:47.304]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[02:20:47.724 --> 02:20:51.886]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[02:20:52.427 --> 02:20:59.811]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group, and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[02:21:00.239 --> 02:21:04.221]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[02:21:04.601 --> 02:21:18.049]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:21.831]  I personally invite you to join me as a distributor of Stem Enhancement.
[02:21:22.248 --> 02:21:26.492]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[02:21:26.852 --> 02:21:29.775]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[02:21:29.915 --> 02:21:33.239]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margitis, at 860-567-7744.
[02:21:33.279 --> 02:21:34.239]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[02:21:53.314 --> 02:21:54.335]  I want to get into the news.
[02:21:54.355 --> 02:21:55.176]  We've got to hurry here.
[02:21:55.236 --> 02:21:59.500]  It was a great caller last segment, but I had him on for like eight minutes, so I'm going to have to move quicker here.
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:02.142]  Let's talk to Dave in Georgia.
[02:22:02.383 --> 02:22:02.703]  Welcome.
[02:22:02.723 --> 02:22:03.464]  You're on the airwaves.
[02:22:03.864 --> 02:22:05.025]  Hello, Alex.
[02:22:05.065 --> 02:22:05.986]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:22:06.547 --> 02:22:12.292]  I wanted to ask you, I have looked on Infowars.com, and I've not heard you comment on the airwaves.
[02:22:12.825 --> 02:22:18.868]  About Aaron Russo's film, From Freedom to Fascism, if you were able to see that when it showed in Austin.
[02:22:18.888 --> 02:22:25.632]  No, I wasn't, but we put links to it up on the site several times, and we've interviewed him in the past.
[02:22:25.972 --> 02:22:26.632]  Yes, okay.
[02:22:27.193 --> 02:22:31.175]  I was looking for a comment from you if you had seen it, and I hope you get to see it sometime soon.
[02:22:33.076 --> 02:22:34.417]  One other question, I suppose, is...
[02:22:35.765 --> 02:22:38.406]  Do you use a toothpaste that has fluoride in it?
[02:22:38.666 --> 02:22:39.246]  No, I don't.
[02:22:40.047 --> 02:22:40.927]  What do you use?
[02:22:41.007 --> 02:22:42.108]  I'm unable to find it.
[02:22:42.128 --> 02:22:45.269]  There's a whole bunch of... How big of a town do you live in?
[02:22:45.449 --> 02:22:46.890]  Very, very, very small.
[02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:49.991]  Well, you can just order toothpaste online.
[02:22:50.031 --> 02:22:52.352]  There's Tom's of Maine.
[02:22:52.652 --> 02:22:53.793]  Yeah, it has fluoride in it.
[02:22:54.193 --> 02:22:54.293]  No.
[02:22:54.924 --> 02:22:55.284]  No, sir.
[02:22:55.984 --> 02:23:00.305]  Let me just tell you, they offer it without fluoride.
[02:23:00.345 --> 02:23:10.948]  I was about to say, some of their varieties do have it in there, and a lot of times, yeah, you'll see Toms of Maine and Walgreens, but they won't have the other Toms next to it.
[02:23:10.968 --> 02:23:12.388]  But then there's a bunch of other companies.
[02:23:12.888 --> 02:23:17.169]  You know, I go to Whole Foods here in Austin, or I go to Central Market.
[02:23:17.209 --> 02:23:20.270]  We're blessed to have more organic things here, as people demand them.
[02:23:20.290 --> 02:23:21.370]  They're the nicest grocery stores.
[02:23:21.930 --> 02:23:24.111]  And they might have 20 brands of it.
[02:23:24.451 --> 02:23:27.492]  There's actually, I can't remember the names of them, but there's some other brands that are even better.
[02:23:27.532 --> 02:23:39.715]  I haven't found, I mean, Tom's is okay, like their Spearmint or Mint, or Begging Soda, and Stevia, what are those other things, but it really gets your teeth clean and it's great.
[02:23:40.255 --> 02:23:42.576]  Well, next time I get to the big city, I'll look.
[02:23:42.976 --> 02:23:48.277]  And I commend what you're doing to get the Citizens Rulebook out there to people.
[02:23:48.857 --> 02:23:50.978]  It's a very important thing that people learn
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:24:04.046]  I agree with you, sir, and I'm glad that you and others are trying to get off the sodium and stannous fluoride.
[02:24:04.106 --> 02:24:04.606]  Anything else?
[02:24:05.266 --> 02:24:05.787]  That'll be it.
[02:24:05.887 --> 02:24:06.407]  Thank you, sir.
[02:24:06.567 --> 02:24:07.908]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:24:08.789 --> 02:24:11.791]  Dave, let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Canada.
[02:24:11.851 --> 02:24:12.451]  Welcome, Adam.
[02:24:12.831 --> 02:24:13.312]  Hi, how are you?
[02:24:13.572 --> 02:24:13.772]  Good.
[02:24:14.192 --> 02:24:14.952]  I know you've got no time.
[02:24:16.133 --> 02:24:18.955]  My question is about the Jon Stewart Show, the Daily Show.
[02:24:19.175 --> 02:24:19.435]  Yes.
[02:24:20.535 --> 02:24:21.436]  Whose side is he on?
[02:24:21.456 --> 02:24:26.739]  Because he just seems to make jokes and make it so everybody goes to bed almost humorous about the...
[02:24:27.679 --> 02:24:31.942]  The party, like... Well, a lot of real news gets covered there.
[02:24:32.743 --> 02:24:33.844]  It isn't hardcore enough.
[02:24:33.884 --> 02:24:36.366]  I'm surprised they even let that on mainstream television.
[02:24:37.026 --> 02:24:38.507]  And, I mean, overall, I think it's pretty good.
[02:24:38.547 --> 02:24:40.649]  But still, it acts like the liberals are going to save you.
[02:24:41.129 --> 02:24:41.350]  Right.
[02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:45.473]  It's like one episode of Bill Maher's show on HBO might be great stuff.
[02:24:45.493 --> 02:24:47.174]  The bird flu is a hoax to take over.
[02:24:47.194 --> 02:24:48.775]  The New World Order is bad.
[02:24:49.115 --> 02:24:50.617]  Bush is involved in 9-11.
[02:24:50.897 --> 02:24:54.199]  And the next episode, abortion is just wonderful, and let's have more of it.
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:54.760]  Right.
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:57.642]  I also want to say, Charlie Sheen, that's great.
[02:24:57.682 --> 02:25:03.506]  I hope more come out, and I learn new stuff every day from your show, and keep up the good work, and I'll continue listening.
[02:25:03.726 --> 02:25:04.146]  Thank you, sir.
[02:25:04.206 --> 02:25:05.187]  And be an activist.
[02:25:05.247 --> 02:25:05.567]  Thank you.
[02:25:05.867 --> 02:25:06.468]  I appreciate it.
[02:25:06.848 --> 02:25:11.231]  Yeah, I mean, some of the neocons out there, I mean, they get mad if we get on air and say Bush is anti-Second Amendment.
[02:25:11.251 --> 02:25:18.356]  So, you know, just because we get a few mean emails or some talk shows around the country are attacking us, I mean, are we surprised?
[02:25:18.876 --> 02:25:21.078]  The point is, he's a big Hollywood actor, and he's questioning 9-11.
[02:25:22.447 --> 02:25:23.808]  And hopefully more will.
[02:25:24.188 --> 02:25:36.956]  But there's a whole bunch of other doctors and scientists and people in Congress, and we ought to put Cynthia McKinney, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, up in that article that Paul and I did about Sheen going public a few days ago, because we have all those experts that have gone public.
[02:25:37.256 --> 02:25:39.737]  There's so many others we didn't list there, like Cynthia McKinney and others.
[02:25:40.658 --> 02:25:44.800]  Let's go ahead and talk to Liz in Texas.
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:45.921]  Liz, welcome.
[02:25:47.402 --> 02:25:47.822]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:47.962 --> 02:25:48.042]  Hi.
[02:25:48.202 --> 02:25:48.222]  I...
[02:25:51.570 --> 02:25:53.150]  Got a call from a friend today.
[02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:58.892]  She works for a hotel that's part of a major chain, national chain, international, I think.
[02:25:59.492 --> 02:26:06.533]  And she said that when she clocked in today, she not only had to give a thumbprint, but they're doing breathalyzers before each shift now.
[02:26:07.293 --> 02:26:09.854]  She doesn't have a company vehicle or anything.
[02:26:09.874 --> 02:26:12.974]  Is this something we're going to see more of?
[02:26:13.394 --> 02:26:14.415]  Yeah, tell us the chain.
[02:26:14.435 --> 02:26:15.395]  I mean, you can tell us that.
[02:26:16.075 --> 02:26:16.495]  Drury.
[02:26:16.515 --> 02:26:19.576]  Drury Incorporated.
[02:26:20.236 --> 02:26:20.736]  What is that?
[02:26:21.941 --> 02:26:22.581]  It's a hotel.
[02:26:23.401 --> 02:26:26.162]  Are you not familiar with the Drury brand of hotel?
[02:26:28.402 --> 02:26:30.083]  Your audio is a little bit hard for me to hear.
[02:26:30.103 --> 02:26:31.123]  I apologize.
[02:26:31.163 --> 02:26:31.823]  No, no, it's okay.
[02:26:31.863 --> 02:26:33.223]  Kind of your pronunciation.
[02:26:34.283 --> 02:26:36.304]  But it sounds like you're saying Drury?
[02:26:37.164 --> 02:26:37.584]  Drury.
[02:26:37.604 --> 02:26:39.624]  D-R-U-R-Y?
[02:26:40.164 --> 02:26:41.665]  No, I'm not familiar with that hotel.
[02:26:42.165 --> 02:26:44.905]  I guess I'm in the dark ages.
[02:26:44.985 --> 02:26:47.586]  I don't like Hyatt and Hilton and La Quinta and all those, but...
[02:26:49.384 --> 02:26:50.807]  I know that Dillard's does that.
[02:26:50.867 --> 02:26:52.269]  I know HEB does that.
[02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:56.016]  I know that the majority of big corporations are going to that.
[02:26:56.036 --> 02:26:57.939]  And I have heard they're going to start breathalyzers.
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:00.844]  Again, we're all guilty until proven innocent.
[02:27:01.850 --> 02:27:08.493]  And then pretty soon they're going to make you take vaccines when you get your driver's license renewed.
[02:27:09.274 --> 02:27:10.834]  Everything's going to be biomedical.
[02:27:10.875 --> 02:27:14.336]  They're going to start taking DNA tests when you get your driver's license as well.
[02:27:14.796 --> 02:27:17.978]  We saw the federal plans on that a decade ago, and now it's happening.
[02:27:18.258 --> 02:27:19.659]  You want to tell me more about it when we get back?
[02:27:19.679 --> 02:27:20.899]  I want to hear just a little bit more, okay?
[02:27:21.340 --> 02:27:27.823]  Well, I'm going to have to go here to get back to my job, but since when is a consumer background check part of an application process?
[02:27:27.923 --> 02:27:29.784]  That I'd like people to start talking about.
[02:27:30.991 --> 02:27:31.392]  Okay.
[02:27:31.812 --> 02:27:33.493]  Now, does she do it every time she clocks in?
[02:27:36.456 --> 02:27:37.397]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.417 --> 02:27:39.459]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.479 --> 02:27:43.182]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.125 --> 02:27:50.168]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:53.792]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:27:53.972 --> 02:27:57.395]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:27:57.685 --> 02:28:00.927]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:28:00.947 --> 02:28:06.431]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:28:06.451 --> 02:28:16.098]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:28:16.218 --> 02:28:17.559]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:28:17.599 --> 02:28:23.003]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:28:23.485 --> 02:28:27.988]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:28:28.008 --> 02:28:29.389]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:28:29.549 --> 02:28:33.371]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:34.291]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:28:45.902 --> 02:28:54.164]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.404 --> 02:28:58.765]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:59.065 --> 02:29:07.967]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.187 --> 02:29:11.808]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.988 --> 02:29:12.749]  We're good to go.
[02:29:12.769 --> 02:29:13.229]  We're good to go.
[02:29:24.631 --> 02:29:25.272]  What about you?
[02:29:25.933 --> 02:29:31.279]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:29:31.339 --> 02:29:32.360]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:34.402]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.249 --> 02:29:52.615]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:52.815 --> 02:29:57.819]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:06.066]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.227 --> 02:30:13.273]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:13.473 --> 02:30:14.693]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:14.834 --> 02:30:18.235]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:18.295 --> 02:30:19.395]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:19.696 --> 02:30:20.976]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:30:21.176 --> 02:30:27.999]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:30.560]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:33.683]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.703 --> 02:30:33.743]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.763 --> 02:30:34.724]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:55.137 --> 02:30:56.658]  Mike, Kim, David, Patrick, Steve.
[02:30:56.698 --> 02:30:59.220]  Calls are coming up on the cover news right now.
[02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:00.100]  We're running out of time.
[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:03.262]  The last caller, Liz in Texas, I guess she had to get back to work.
[02:31:03.342 --> 02:31:05.524]  I'm sorry she had to hold for 30 minutes to get on air.
[02:31:22.912 --> 02:31:23.813]  I guess I misunderstood her.
[02:31:23.833 --> 02:31:28.936]  I thought she was saying just a clock in they have to do that, and then she was saying for a job application they have to do that.
[02:31:29.477 --> 02:31:33.480]  I've heard they're trying to breathalyze people that go to work who aren't even driving a car.
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:36.281]  Again, what does that teach you?
[02:31:36.341 --> 02:31:38.263]  It teaches you that we're all criminals.
[02:31:38.283 --> 02:31:39.103]  We're all bad.
[02:31:39.584 --> 02:31:41.645]  We're guilty until proven innocent.
[02:31:41.685 --> 02:31:51.792]  Well, in free societies, you're innocent until proven guilty, and statistically, governments engage in more crime, more bad things, even per capita.
[02:31:52.346 --> 02:31:55.087]  You know, it's not just that government's so big so it's going to do the most harm.
[02:31:55.127 --> 02:31:55.587]  No, no, no, no.
[02:31:56.147 --> 02:31:59.308]  Statistically, there's more crime because there's no accountability.
[02:32:00.328 --> 02:32:02.749]  So I'm not saying you're all criminals because you're in government.
[02:32:02.809 --> 02:32:05.329]  I'm saying that it's totally unaccountable.
[02:32:05.369 --> 02:32:20.113]  I mean, when they can do drug trials on little black kids and kill them, knowing it's going to kill them with a pesticide, and no one gets in trouble and the CPS blows the whistle, the people that took the kids blow the whistle, why are we delivering little kids to a private medical firm to be killed?
[02:32:20.925 --> 02:32:24.206]  And then, well, you just better shut up, and you're fired, and then no one gets in trouble.
[02:32:24.646 --> 02:32:26.126]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks.
[02:32:28.046 --> 02:32:31.107]  Trillions are missing from the Pentagon, and no one gets in trouble for it.
[02:32:32.207 --> 02:32:35.668]  There's just corruption everywhere, and you've got the Democrats in office.
[02:32:36.048 --> 02:32:41.809]  The Democrats sit around giggling and snickering and don't care what the Democrats are doing because they're owned by the same global interest.
[02:32:42.029 --> 02:32:46.610]  And then when a Republican's in office, Bush can do whatever he wants, and Republicans just go, Good, I like it!
[02:32:47.170 --> 02:32:48.311]  Or it's a lie!
[02:32:48.551 --> 02:32:50.351]  You're a liar and call me Alex!
[02:32:52.364 --> 02:32:53.284]  And I'm freaked out.
[02:32:53.324 --> 02:32:58.806]  I mean, during the break, I was talking to some staff in the back, and I'm just like, man, I'm freaking myself out.
[02:32:58.846 --> 02:32:59.846]  I mean, this is real.
[02:33:00.467 --> 02:33:01.367]  This is true.
[02:33:02.767 --> 02:33:03.848]  This is admitted.
[02:33:04.988 --> 02:33:06.449]  Our government paid.
[02:33:06.549 --> 02:33:09.990]  This is one case out of hundreds that we know of that are admitted.
[02:33:11.890 --> 02:33:14.111]  To have Israel take 110,000 elementary students and murder them.
[02:33:19.511 --> 02:33:22.014]  With radiation, knowing it would kill them.
[02:33:22.235 --> 02:33:24.437]  It wasn't some kind of radiation test.
[02:33:24.477 --> 02:33:26.180]  It was a weird extermination program.
[02:33:27.041 --> 02:33:28.002]  I mean, I have trouble.
[02:33:28.062 --> 02:33:31.627]  I don't blame you for denying it or rationalizing or saying I'm a liar.
[02:33:32.087 --> 02:33:33.729]  I don't want to believe it, but it's true.
[02:33:33.769 --> 02:33:36.433]  It's in the Jerusalem Post, making excuses for it.
[02:33:39.867 --> 02:33:49.975]  I remember ten years ago at my parents' house visiting for dinner, and I opened up Time Magazine, and they've got a little blurb about it, and I already knew about it, but there it was in Time Magazine, or was it Newsweek?
[02:33:50.035 --> 02:33:50.555]  I don't remember.
[02:33:50.575 --> 02:34:01.404]  And it was talking about in New Mexico and Nevada, different bases, they'd tell the pregnant wife, the doctor, of course he'd be German, I'm not knocking Germans.
[02:34:03.188 --> 02:34:03.328]  I think?
[02:34:13.829 --> 02:34:21.274]  Tens of thousands of Germans were brought here to run our rocketry, our science, our bioweapons, our road construction systems.
[02:34:21.314 --> 02:34:24.617]  It was a former Nazi that designed the autobahns in America.
[02:34:24.637 --> 02:34:25.537]  You know them as the interstate?
[02:34:25.777 --> 02:34:26.858]  That's admitted, by the way.
[02:34:27.178 --> 02:34:28.880]  Just type history of U.S.
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:29.300]  highways.
[02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:34.764]  It'll be Dwight Eisenhower implemented the German autobahn model using German architect, blah, blah, blah.
[02:34:36.325 --> 02:34:37.245]  I mean, it goes on and on.
[02:34:37.345 --> 02:34:42.289]  Albert Speer, you know, was released and even allowed to advise the chief architect for Adolf Hitler.
[02:34:43.792 --> 02:34:46.314]  There's major NASA facilities named after Nazis.
[02:34:47.315 --> 02:34:48.776]  But no, it was German doctors.
[02:34:49.857 --> 02:34:52.499]  They'd had evil people who'd worked for Hitler to then train American doctors.
[02:34:52.539 --> 02:34:54.140]  They'd tell them, well, the communists are going to attack.
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.061]  This is going to be terrible.
[02:34:55.601 --> 02:34:59.924]  But we've got to do this to test to see what will happen.
[02:34:59.944 --> 02:35:01.285]  Well, really, they already knew what would happen.
[02:35:01.325 --> 02:35:02.807]  It was really a test of personnel.
[02:35:03.547 --> 02:35:08.651]  And imagine a sweet young GI wife, 22 years old, one case I read about, I remember.
[02:35:09.312 --> 02:35:12.334]  And she comes in and they go, here's some vitamins for your baby.
[02:35:13.749 --> 02:35:16.472]  And right behind the glass mirror, there are Nazis sitting there.
[02:35:17.032 --> 02:35:27.082]  And the American doctor, and then they know that in 12 hours she takes the uranium pills, in some cases plutonium pills, she's going to have a violent miscarriage, and they've got actual film cameras ready.
[02:35:28.103 --> 02:35:34.530]  And she's right down the street from them, they're at the base, and she takes them, and they did this to thousands.
[02:35:35.330 --> 02:35:49.115]  And then she comes in crying and she's vomiting and she's having a miscarriage and she's eight months pregnant and these ghouls, these ghouls, are there running cameras on it?
[02:35:49.335 --> 02:35:51.435]  I mean, I don't know where this stuff comes from.
[02:35:51.875 --> 02:35:53.336]  And I'm reading it in Time Magazine.
[02:35:54.548 --> 02:35:57.150]  You know, I read the declassified reports on it and knew about it.
[02:35:57.170 --> 02:36:04.534]  One of the first things I learned about, I don't know, I guess 14 years ago or so, when I was doing research on the New World Order, was how they give pregnant women uranium and plutonium pills.
[02:36:04.794 --> 02:36:07.356]  I mean, just please, please, please listen to me.
[02:36:07.596 --> 02:36:09.017]  I don't even want to cover the news anymore.
[02:36:09.237 --> 02:36:10.577]  I want to talk to the police.
[02:36:11.398 --> 02:36:12.659]  I want to talk to people in government.
[02:36:12.779 --> 02:36:15.020]  I'm not making this up, and you can go prove it to yourselves.
[02:36:16.601 --> 02:36:17.482]  We're in danger.
[02:36:17.662 --> 02:36:18.842]  These people are evil.
[02:36:19.623 --> 02:36:21.304]  They're doing evil things to us.
[02:36:23.542 --> 02:36:24.803]  I've now been reading the studies.
[02:36:24.843 --> 02:36:29.005]  There's a reason allergies are up all over the world, and people who never had them have them.
[02:36:29.045 --> 02:36:32.026]  Everyone I know has them now, not just in Austin, but everywhere.
[02:36:32.706 --> 02:36:34.127]  People are coughing and sick all the time.
[02:36:34.167 --> 02:36:37.568]  It's because they've released all sorts of weird biologicals in the air.
[02:36:37.989 --> 02:36:42.731]  Then I'm getting reports that they've figured out how to crystallize viruses where there's slow release in the body.
[02:36:44.451 --> 02:36:45.672]  There's DU in the air.
[02:36:45.692 --> 02:36:48.093]  These nut cases have used the equivalent of 44,000 A-bombs.
[02:36:56.121 --> 02:36:58.974]  That's how much of this has been powdered and put into the air.
[02:37:01.244 --> 02:37:03.305]  I mean, we're living in an insane asylum.
[02:37:03.445 --> 02:37:06.867]  And believe me, I wish they wouldn't have killed those Jewish children.
[02:37:06.947 --> 02:37:07.947]  I wish that wasn't true.
[02:37:08.288 --> 02:37:09.088]  I've got a life.
[02:37:09.588 --> 02:37:10.449]  I enjoy my life.
[02:37:10.489 --> 02:37:11.589]  I want to go on vacations.
[02:37:11.649 --> 02:37:12.550]  I want to see Europe.
[02:37:12.650 --> 02:37:13.930]  I want to see Asia.
[02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:21.054]  I want to make money and live my life and spend time with my family and go have a business and not just be a normal person.
[02:37:21.174 --> 02:37:21.614]  I can't.
[02:37:21.734 --> 02:37:24.035]  I found out that they killed G.I.'
[02:37:23.995 --> 02:37:24.476]  's wives.
[02:37:24.516 --> 02:37:27.357]  And that's just one of hundreds of these admitted things.
[02:37:27.417 --> 02:37:28.798]  I mean, they'll murder babies.
[02:37:29.798 --> 02:37:31.119]  Many times the women would die.
[02:37:32.259 --> 02:37:32.959]  You know how they die?
[02:37:32.979 --> 02:37:33.940]  Their gums start bleeding.
[02:37:34.460 --> 02:37:37.221]  The fast-growing cells of the intestines break down and liquefy.
[02:37:38.362 --> 02:37:39.162]  The organs fail.
[02:37:40.823 --> 02:37:47.426]  And then they had other cases where... There's so many other cases.
[02:37:48.066 --> 02:37:51.128]  They told the Seventh-day Adventist church, have your men volunteer.
[02:37:51.148 --> 02:37:52.128]  At least they volunteered.
[02:37:52.608 --> 02:37:55.109]  We're going to use radiation and bioweapons on them.
[02:37:55.129 --> 02:37:58.631]  And those guys cared so much about America, they volunteered...
[02:37:59.503 --> 02:38:00.824]  And I think it's crazy.
[02:38:00.904 --> 02:38:01.564]  And went and did it.
[02:38:02.244 --> 02:38:03.004]  And some of them died.
[02:38:03.024 --> 02:38:09.206]  And they'd start them off before they went to write to killing women and their babies, healthy babies.
[02:38:09.246 --> 02:38:12.588]  They'd start out with a four-year-old retarded child or deformed child.
[02:38:13.108 --> 02:38:14.408]  And over to give them a free treatment.
[02:38:14.428 --> 02:38:15.208]  And they'd radiate them.
[02:38:15.449 --> 02:38:17.569]  And then there was a backlash and people got mad.
[02:38:18.370 --> 02:38:21.050]  There were some shootings on bases, people getting mad like they should.
[02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:23.011]  And so they just contacted Israel.
[02:38:23.031 --> 02:38:25.072]  And they said, we know that the...
[02:38:29.249 --> 02:38:31.830]  We know that the Sephardi are the minority in your country.
[02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:37.252]  We know that the Ashkenazi leadership, the European leadership, doesn't particularly like them.
[02:38:37.953 --> 02:38:39.653]  And so it was Sephardi Jews.
[02:38:40.494 --> 02:38:46.056]  It was some kind of weird, weird, intramural Nazi Jewish behavior.
[02:38:46.536 --> 02:38:48.517]  You know, I mean, I'm freaked out by this.
[02:38:50.197 --> 02:38:57.600]  I mean, whenever I'm up at midnight working, and I'm just thinking, I've got a headache, I don't want to work anymore, I just push myself.
[02:38:57.620 --> 02:38:59.001]  I haven't worked as hard as I should lately.
[02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:05.431]  I just say to myself, my gosh, I mean, we're in trouble.
[02:39:06.752 --> 02:39:08.713]  We're in a lot of trouble right now.
[02:39:10.754 --> 02:39:19.998]  And I just love my family so much, and they're just good, and they're decent, and they're innocent, and they're sweet, and they need somebody to protect them, and your family needs that too.
[02:39:21.219 --> 02:39:25.321]  And I just want the people that serve this government who are in denial to know I'm not lying to you.
[02:39:26.341 --> 02:39:27.422]  I'm telling you the truth.
[02:39:28.419 --> 02:39:33.925]  And I know a lot of you just watch TV or sports and you've not learned how to use search engines.
[02:39:34.606 --> 02:39:36.428]  You know, that is NSA power.
[02:39:38.049 --> 02:39:41.273]  That is echelon power.
[02:39:42.394 --> 02:39:47.900]  That is the NSA 10 years ago didn't have what Google has and Yahoo has today.
[02:39:48.601 --> 02:39:50.483]  The investigative tool of that.
[02:39:52.691 --> 02:40:00.814]  Because you can be on the Library of Congress, National Security Archives, National Archives, CIA.gov, and you can read why our government admits they carry out terror attacks.
[02:40:00.874 --> 02:40:02.934]  You see, they haven't shifted yet.
[02:40:03.154 --> 02:40:04.355]  They haven't figured this out yet.
[02:40:04.775 --> 02:40:06.535]  These old, arrogant men that run things.
[02:40:07.176 --> 02:40:08.256]  They didn't understand.
[02:40:11.225 --> 02:40:18.707]  They're still in the old world where they'll write manuals, even write published books, and 10,000 globalists read it, and nobody else does, and they call us slaves and say they're going to kill us.
[02:40:19.227 --> 02:40:26.949]  And now they're getting a little freaked out because now all the stuff they've done and all the things they've declassified, that's why Bush is going back and declassifying stuff 50 years.
[02:40:27.089 --> 02:40:30.430]  They're not saying public things that have been out for decades are now declassified.
[02:40:30.450 --> 02:40:31.810]  I mean, now reclassified.
[02:40:33.151 --> 02:40:34.131]  Because they have to.
[02:40:37.712 --> 02:40:38.572]  I mean, when you read
[02:40:41.152 --> 02:40:50.276]  About our army taking our young soldiers and putting them out in the field and flying over them and nerve-gassing them and killing them.
[02:40:51.517 --> 02:40:52.437]  You know we're in trouble.
[02:40:55.976 --> 02:41:02.018]  They've got all these cop shows on TV to teach you you're the best, and the government's on your side, and we're all bad, and the government's going to take care of you.
[02:41:02.038 --> 02:41:03.718]  Oh, they care so much about you.
[02:41:03.738 --> 02:41:08.000]  It's why we've got this policy to keep you safe from the public, and the public doesn't know for their own good.
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:10.741]  We've got to keep them in line, and they're kind of the enemy now.
[02:41:10.821 --> 02:41:13.741]  And thin black line, you should be thin blue line now, thin ski mask line.
[02:41:14.322 --> 02:41:15.822]  And we're going to take care of you, officers.
[02:41:16.642 --> 02:41:17.122]  Baloney.
[02:41:19.383 --> 02:41:22.044]  So you're listening to your squad cars in different cities around the country right now.
[02:41:24.818 --> 02:41:27.159]  And if you love your families, you'll check out what I'm saying.
[02:41:27.179 --> 02:41:27.899]  You'll investigate.
[02:41:27.919 --> 02:41:28.939]  You'll get your notepad out.
[02:41:29.699 --> 02:41:30.880]  You'll write down what I'm claiming.
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:33.200]  Here's a few words.
[02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:34.040]  Project Shad.
[02:41:35.581 --> 02:41:37.161]  Operation Northwoods.
[02:41:41.942 --> 02:41:46.344]  Servicemen's wives given uranium.
[02:41:49.564 --> 02:41:51.765]  Children die in New York drug studies.
[02:41:53.436 --> 02:41:55.717]  Foster children die in drug studies.
[02:41:57.297 --> 02:41:58.677]  And then just read it.
[02:41:59.658 --> 02:42:00.578]  Just start.
[02:42:00.618 --> 02:42:05.019]  And I could just go for hours after hour after hour.
[02:42:05.739 --> 02:42:07.560]  And somebody's got to talk about it.
[02:42:07.580 --> 02:42:10.561]  People say, oh, you're so brave, they could kill you, and you've been attacked before.
[02:42:10.601 --> 02:42:13.121]  And oh, oh, Alex, you're so great.
[02:42:13.261 --> 02:42:14.201]  I'm not great.
[02:42:14.922 --> 02:42:19.723]  They're psychopathic killers on the loose, running things.
[02:42:20.783 --> 02:42:24.465]  My family's in danger breathing the crap these people put in the air.
[02:42:26.025 --> 02:42:27.426]  They're doing all these horrible things.
[02:42:27.586 --> 02:42:29.407]  All I'm doing is trying to survive.
[02:42:30.267 --> 02:42:34.589]  I'd be brave in a stupid way if I didn't speak up.
[02:42:35.629 --> 02:42:40.591]  I'd be just mindlessly brave if I just said, oh, so what, knowing what I know, and went along with it.
[02:42:42.210 --> 02:42:47.092]  I mean, it's the equivalent of the enemies at the gates, and I'm just going, you know, the enemy's coming in to kill us, and I'm going to fight them.
[02:42:47.332 --> 02:42:48.432]  You're like, oh, you're so brave.
[02:42:48.913 --> 02:42:49.813]  What do you mean I'm brave?
[02:42:49.833 --> 02:42:50.813]  I'm trying to live here.
[02:42:50.833 --> 02:42:56.235]  I mean, whoever told you laying down is going to save you.
[02:42:57.656 --> 02:43:00.037]  I mean, if you're afraid out there, you better fight.
[02:43:05.879 --> 02:43:06.859]  You know, I know we've got a lot of phone lines.
[02:43:06.899 --> 02:43:07.660]  I said I'd take your calls.
[02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:08.580]  I just...
[02:43:10.922 --> 02:43:13.423]  You know, working on this new film has really freaked me out.
[02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:15.044]  I've learned so much more.
[02:43:15.064 --> 02:43:16.525]  It's so much worse than I thought.
[02:43:17.145 --> 02:43:21.148]  When I learn the government brags about all this stuff, it's even worse than I knew.
[02:43:21.168 --> 02:43:28.812]  It's sick to read them admitting that they're killers and that they're going to kill us and that they carry out terror.
[02:43:31.613 --> 02:43:32.354]  It blows me away.
[02:43:35.652 --> 02:43:39.314]  And then there's all these sophomoric, flimsy lies they put out.
[02:43:39.334 --> 02:43:43.856]  And then I get e-mails from the neocons, going, see, Bush is against you, Mortar Alex.
[02:43:45.857 --> 02:43:46.957]  I caught you, liar.
[02:43:48.938 --> 02:43:49.438]  Listen to this.
[02:43:50.238 --> 02:43:50.999]  Associated Press.
[02:43:51.099 --> 02:43:53.240]  Bush rules out amnesty for undocumented workers.
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:53.820]  You read that?
[02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:54.980]  Oh, he doesn't want amnesty.
[02:43:55.861 --> 02:43:57.702]  Remember the last three State of the Unions?
[02:43:57.722 --> 02:43:59.683]  He says, I want a guest worker program.
[02:43:59.723 --> 02:44:00.583]  It is not amnesty.
[02:44:00.663 --> 02:44:01.563]  It is total.
[02:44:01.663 --> 02:44:02.344]  I've read the plan.
[02:44:02.644 --> 02:44:05.145]  Had Congressmen on, Townsend, Credo, Paul, others about it,
[02:44:05.817 --> 02:44:10.060]  It legalizes anyone that's here for six years, who's here or can get here for six years.
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:15.283]  It allows unlimited guest worker program, rubber stamp for skilled and unskilled.
[02:44:15.643 --> 02:44:21.767]  You think the HP3 visas for all the Indian and Chinese workers taking your job, you think that's bad?
[02:44:21.927 --> 02:44:23.048]  This is unlimited.
[02:44:23.728 --> 02:44:25.389]  This is unlimited.
[02:44:25.409 --> 02:44:32.694]  It allows jets full from China and India and Latin America to land with the skilled workers in Eastern Europe.
[02:44:33.994 --> 02:44:34.755]  It's all in the bill.
[02:44:36.397 --> 02:44:39.078]  But see, they changed the name so it is an amnesty.
[02:44:39.138 --> 02:44:40.698]  Oh, I'm not going to have amnesty.
[02:44:40.718 --> 02:44:42.719]  I'm not about to put up with that for a minute.
[02:44:42.759 --> 02:44:48.781]  I'm George W. But I am going to have a guest worker program.
[02:44:49.401 --> 02:44:50.761]  And I remember one day I was in the car.
[02:44:51.141 --> 02:44:53.022]  I told this story once, and I was listening to Sean Hannity.
[02:44:53.302 --> 02:44:56.163]  I was driving home from the studio, and I was listening to Sean Hannity in the car.
[02:44:57.904 --> 02:45:02.967]  And he went for ten minutes about how we've got to fight the open borders and blah, blah, blah, and Bush is doing a great job.
[02:45:02.987 --> 02:45:03.648]  And I said, no, he's not.
[02:45:04.188 --> 02:45:08.811]  And I knew he was going to say we've got to have the guest worker program to fix it after this big rant.
[02:45:08.831 --> 02:45:14.495]  So he tells you the truth about the open borders, but then his solution is guest worker program, and boom, he dropped it.
[02:45:14.535 --> 02:45:15.595]  You know what they're going to do.
[02:45:15.836 --> 02:45:16.496]  It's a script.
[02:45:17.317 --> 02:45:18.537]  And here's the script right here.
[02:45:18.617 --> 02:45:25.662]  President George W. Bush said he was opposed to amnesty or automatic citizenship for some 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.
[02:45:26.511 --> 02:45:28.952]  Amid the intense debate over the issue among U.S.
[02:45:28.972 --> 02:45:36.953]  lawmakers, Bush on Tuesday ruled out amnesty for illegal immigrants, but said he favored a guest worker program that would provide legal status for workers for a limited time, period.
[02:45:36.993 --> 02:45:42.454]  Yeah, and then after three years, and this is open for six, you can then become a citizen.
[02:45:44.135 --> 02:45:48.796]  So, in my judgment, amnesty would be the wrong course of action, Bush told the news conference.
[02:45:49.336 --> 02:45:53.597]  He said a whole industry of exploitation had emerged with workers being smuggled across the U.S.
[02:45:53.637 --> 02:45:54.957]  border in dangerous conditions.
[02:45:55.427 --> 02:46:06.375]  The best way to do something about it is to say that if you're an American and won't do a job, and you can't find somebody who will do the job, they ought to be allowed to do it legally on a temporary basis.
[02:46:10.158 --> 02:46:23.088]  Well, yeah, you bring in a bunch of illegal aliens who live ten to a one-room shack, and they'll send half their money home and sit there and live off of eggs and toast.
[02:46:23.729 --> 02:46:24.449]  Hard-working folks.
[02:46:24.489 --> 02:46:25.170]  I don't dislike them.
[02:46:26.064 --> 02:46:28.987]  Hard-working cowboys, a lot of them.
[02:46:29.087 --> 02:46:32.210]  Especially the types that come up here from northern Mexico into Texas.
[02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:34.932]  It's a little bit different stuff happening in California.
[02:46:36.133 --> 02:46:37.554]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:46:37.975 --> 02:46:40.537]  Of course Americans can't do the job of paying insurance and doing everything.
[02:46:40.557 --> 02:46:43.119]  What you've done is blown out our skilled tradesmen.
[02:46:43.139 --> 02:46:45.321]  What you've done is insured the whole middle class is gone.
[02:46:45.842 --> 02:46:46.843]  And that's officially happened.
[02:46:48.724 --> 02:46:50.766]  And then every day I see these type of articles.
[02:46:50.846 --> 02:46:51.367]  Every day.
[02:46:56.497 --> 02:47:01.582]  Every single day, four vehicles carrying possible illegals crash.
[02:47:01.602 --> 02:47:04.724]  113 detained in two days in a rash of accidents on snow-packed highways.
[02:47:04.784 --> 02:47:13.352]  Four vehicles packed with 42 suspected illegal Mexican immigrants overturned on snow-packed eastern Colorado highways within two hours early Tuesday, a day after two similar wrecks in the state.
[02:47:14.533 --> 02:47:18.776]  And I mean, folks, they account in some states for half the fatality accidents.
[02:47:18.817 --> 02:47:19.097]  And why?
[02:47:19.117 --> 02:47:19.177]  Why?
[02:47:19.847 --> 02:47:21.488]  I'm not saying Mexicans can't drive.
[02:47:21.929 --> 02:47:26.692]  But you take a 25-year-old man who grew up on a corn farm in southern Yucatan.
[02:47:27.753 --> 02:47:29.814]  He comes up here and he's suddenly got money in his pocket.
[02:47:29.874 --> 02:47:33.897]  He goes and buys a car without a license, without training, without driver safety.
[02:47:34.318 --> 02:47:35.999]  And then they go out on the roads.
[02:47:36.819 --> 02:47:40.022]  And, man, every time I see a car swerving, it's drunk illegals.
[02:47:40.583 --> 02:47:41.404]  We're good to go.
[02:47:41.484 --> 02:47:42.225]  We're good to go.
[02:48:00.385 --> 02:48:04.246]  Then who accounts for the next biggest group of fatality accidents in America?
[02:48:04.306 --> 02:48:04.986]  It's teenagers.
[02:48:05.467 --> 02:48:08.187]  I'm strongly considering not letting my children have cars when they're 16.
[02:48:08.267 --> 02:48:10.468]  I don't know how my dad let me have one.
[02:48:10.748 --> 02:48:12.309]  He's very nice to me and let me have a car.
[02:48:12.749 --> 02:48:14.369]  I was an absolutely horrible driver.
[02:48:14.909 --> 02:48:15.890]  I'm lucky to be alive.
[02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:25.792]  We got illegal aliens who came off hard-working little rancheros down there in Mexico, and they're up here, and they just get in a car and just down the road.
[02:48:25.812 --> 02:48:27.533]  They don't have insurance, nothing.
[02:48:28.617 --> 02:48:29.298]  Just ignore them.
[02:48:29.318 --> 02:48:30.839]  They're just killing us everywhere.
[02:48:30.959 --> 02:48:33.760]  And they're running over Mexican-Americans, blacks, whites, it doesn't matter.
[02:48:34.861 --> 02:48:37.022]  And then there's all the Asians who don't have a driver's license.
[02:48:38.303 --> 02:48:39.304]  They may be even worse.
[02:48:47.068 --> 02:48:49.930]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.652 --> 02:48:51.933]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:49:12.088 --> 02:49:16.672]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.772 --> 02:49:23.034]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.

[02:52:35.386 --> 02:52:36.486]  Mike in California, go ahead.
[02:52:36.507 --> 02:52:36.927]  You're on the air.
[02:52:36.947 --> 02:52:38.108]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:38.723 --> 02:52:44.590]  Hey, I wanted to tell you, I wanted to get some information to you about something that might help you with your allergies.
[02:52:44.650 --> 02:52:46.933]  Do I call your 800 number to get that to you?
[02:52:48.034 --> 02:52:48.895]  Just tell me now.
[02:52:49.436 --> 02:52:52.920]  Okay, it's a product put out by a company called...
[02:52:55.388 --> 02:52:58.891]  See, I don't believe it's allergies, and the major studies are now showing this.
[02:52:58.951 --> 02:53:02.054]  It's other poisons and toxins and heavy metals in the air.
[02:53:02.454 --> 02:53:12.123]  Okay, well, this stuff, what it does is it balances out your immune system so that your immune system doesn't overreact, and a lot of people have gotten help from it.
[02:53:12.383 --> 02:53:12.964]  Sure, what is it?
[02:53:14.525 --> 02:53:17.368]  Basically, it's a spray form of colostrum.
[02:53:18.274 --> 02:53:22.215]  It's from a company out in Arizona, and I can get the information to you.
[02:53:22.255 --> 02:53:22.855]  I'll just call in.
[02:53:22.875 --> 02:53:26.216]  Colostrum, is that the stuff out of mother's milk?
[02:53:26.556 --> 02:53:27.896]  From milk, from cows, yeah.
[02:53:28.696 --> 02:53:39.019]  And apparently it's helping a lot of people with all kinds of health problems, from hypoglycemia to even multiple sclerosis, but it really helps allergies a lot.
[02:53:39.399 --> 02:53:40.219]  Well, that's exciting.
[02:53:40.259 --> 02:53:42.020]  I'll check it out, and thank you for that call.
[02:53:42.060 --> 02:53:43.140]  I really appreciate that, Mike.
[02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:45.180]  That's very nice of you to try to help me.
[02:53:46.101 --> 02:53:47.721]  Kim in Texas, go ahead.
[02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:49.160]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:53.041]  I just wanted to comment on the soy, the person that called in about soy earlier.
[02:53:53.061 --> 02:53:59.443]  I just would like to challenge you and all your listeners to try to go a day without having soy in their diet.
[02:53:59.823 --> 02:54:04.445]  And I think you guys would all be just amazed at how much they're bombarding us with this stuff.
[02:54:04.665 --> 02:54:06.405]  Yeah, and it's full of estrogen.
[02:54:06.445 --> 02:54:13.487]  I believe it's got the highest vegetable concentrate per gram of any vegetable level of estrogen.
[02:54:14.167 --> 02:54:16.748]  Well, and one of my children I found out is allergic to soy.
[02:54:17.598 --> 02:54:24.019]  And something that my husband and I always notice is that in comparison to our other two children, he is very aggressive.
[02:54:24.439 --> 02:54:28.520]  And I never, you know, put that together with that, you know, until I heard the gentleman.
[02:54:28.540 --> 02:54:30.161]  Yeah, you're supposed to be aggressive.
[02:54:30.581 --> 02:54:31.961]  Males are supposed to be aggressive.
[02:54:32.281 --> 02:54:32.561]  Right.
[02:54:32.721 --> 02:54:36.862]  And another thing, too, is I've eliminated the soy from my diet pretty much.
[02:54:37.262 --> 02:54:40.963]  And I used to have allergies like you do, Alex, and I just don't have them anymore.
[02:54:41.536 --> 02:54:43.137]  And I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
[02:54:43.157 --> 02:54:44.218]  It's the stuff they're feeding us.
[02:54:44.278 --> 02:54:45.259]  It's the stuff in the air.
[02:54:45.279 --> 02:54:47.780]  I mean, listen, my grandmother grew up here in Austin.
[02:54:48.121 --> 02:54:49.141]  No one ever had them.
[02:54:49.962 --> 02:54:52.003]  Allergies were unknown 50 years ago.
[02:54:52.023 --> 02:54:53.064]  Now everyone has them.
[02:54:53.344 --> 02:54:53.484]  Right.
[02:54:53.584 --> 02:54:56.747]  I grew up in Austin, too, and I never had allergies.
[02:54:56.787 --> 02:54:58.508]  And there for about five years they were bad.
[02:54:59.286 --> 02:55:01.727]  And like I said, I've changed my diet completely.
[02:55:01.767 --> 02:55:08.490]  Well, you know, my dad, he's a dentist and oral surgeon, but he said he's read a lot of medical studies that are showing it's the foods, it's the genetically engineered foods, too, Traeger.
[02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:09.110]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:09.330 --> 02:55:10.150]  Good to hear from you, Kim.
[02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:11.731]  David in Minnesota, go ahead.
[02:55:13.992 --> 02:55:15.012]  Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:55:15.032 --> 02:55:15.432]  Can you hear me?
[02:55:15.552 --> 02:55:15.872]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:16.192 --> 02:55:16.693]  Okay, great.
[02:55:17.273 --> 02:55:22.715]  First of all, I wanted to just say I've been buying, copying, and distributing your videos now for a couple of years.
[02:55:23.359 --> 02:55:26.562]  And I'm always looking for ways to reach out to people with the truth.
[02:55:26.922 --> 02:55:27.243]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:27.603 --> 02:55:31.206]  One of the ways I started doing it recently is I put up a blog, and I wondered if I could plug my blog.
[02:55:31.246 --> 02:55:32.247]  Sure, go ahead and plug the blog.
[02:55:32.568 --> 02:55:37.492]  Okay, it's I-P-R-O-W-N-O-T dot blogspot dot com.
[02:55:38.273 --> 02:55:40.215]  I-P-R-O-W-N-O-T dot blogspot dot com.
[02:55:40.255 --> 02:55:41.176]  All right, got to let you go.
[02:55:41.276 --> 02:55:42.958]  Sorry, we're just running out of time here.
[02:55:43.238 --> 02:55:44.159]  Patrick in Kentucky.
[02:55:44.199 --> 02:55:44.899]  Go ahead, Patrick.
[02:55:45.940 --> 02:55:46.201]  Hi.
[02:55:46.601 --> 02:55:46.921]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:49.364 --> 02:55:57.127]  A lot of the organic products we get, inter-American foods and these kinds of things, they taste just like poison.
[02:55:57.147 --> 02:55:59.848]  And they're putting stuff in our water.
[02:56:00.609 --> 02:56:02.149]  My skin is burning all over.
[02:56:02.169 --> 02:56:04.470]  I even got a KDF shower filter.
[02:56:05.211 --> 02:56:09.172]  But I was going to make a couple of comments on Operation Northwoods.
[02:56:09.292 --> 02:56:13.734]  I believe it's going to happen with the next president, Stooge, they put in there in 2008.
[02:56:16.887 --> 02:56:22.329]  And I was also going to mention about Winamp, the documentaries.
[02:56:22.829 --> 02:56:23.509]  We're out of time.
[02:56:23.549 --> 02:56:24.149]  God bless you.
[02:56:24.189 --> 02:56:25.370]  Thank you.
