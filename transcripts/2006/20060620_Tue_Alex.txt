[00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:06.603]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:08.324]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:10.226]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:11.647]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:13.268]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.872]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:22.275]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:23.676]  Music
[00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:36.909]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:39.451]  It's Tuesday, the 20th day of June 2006.
[00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:43.493]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:52.019]  Yesterday, the conference coming up this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, sold out, so no more tickets available, either online or at the door.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.201]  It is completely and totally sold out.
[00:00:54.241 --> 00:01:01.246]  That is exciting, and I can't wait to meet all of you that are coming to the event and all the great speakers that are going to be there as well.
[00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:03.928]  We have Jimmy Walter, the...
[00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.850]  Well, you should call him a billionaire philanthropist.
[00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.691]  That's his assets.
[00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:15.095]  He spent $7 million-plus exposing 9-11 as an inside job on TV, radio, and print ads.
[00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:28.702]  We'll be a speaker at the conference, and he's going to be joining us coming up in the next hour for about 30 minutes to talk about his worldwide travels all over the planet, speaking to standing-room-only crowds going on international television.
[00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:40.400]  With one of the 9-11 heroes, William Rodriguez, and they just got back from Malaysia and several other countries, so he'll be giving us an update on the international exposure of the horrible attacks of 9-11.
[00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:43.213]  We're good to go.
[00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:43.373]  I think?
[00:02:00.945 --> 00:02:06.047]  For your request, file to expose plans for the North American Union.
[00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:07.068]  This out of the AP.
[00:02:07.488 --> 00:02:11.790]  We don't even need to get their secret documents and the secret agreements that we know exist.
[00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.450]  They admit exist.
[00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.432]  We have all the public admissions, but we'll be getting into this report today.
[00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:19.673]  Guard troops ordered to New Orleans.
[00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:24.295]  Governor to parents, keep your teenagers off the streets.
[00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:25.296]  That from CNN.
[00:02:26.815 --> 00:02:28.437]  Paul Watson's done a report on this.
[00:02:28.557 --> 00:02:31.359]  Zero-tolerance militarized police state.
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.201]  Negan's National Guard mandate.
[00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:36.544]  Model for post-9-11 camo law enforcement.
[00:02:36.904 --> 00:02:38.406]  The end of posse commentatus.
[00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:41.874]  In Iraq, the sad news is in.
[00:02:42.014 --> 00:02:42.355]  U.S.
[00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:44.396]  bodies showed signs of torture.
[00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:47.557]  Now, I don't doubt that, but it could be a complete lie.
[00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:52.840]  Most of what the Pentagon puts out are complete fabrications or a mixture of truth and lies.
[00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.883]  But they're screaming and yelling and freaking out and going with total evil.
[00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:58.243]  We witness torture, torture.
[00:02:58.524 --> 00:02:59.264]  Can you believe it?
[00:02:59.304 --> 00:02:59.664]  Torture.
[00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:01.605]  Our government says torture is good.
[00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:04.227]  Our government says they can torture children in front of their parents.
[00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:07.050]  I'm having trouble understanding this.
[00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.576]  Certainly it's bad if insurgents torture defenseless troops they've captured.
[00:03:11.616 --> 00:03:12.397]  That's cowardly.
[00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:14.641]  That's scumbag filth behavior.
[00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.585]  And I will call them scumbag filth if it's true.
[00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:18.907]  Again, we have to
[00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:20.292]  I think we're good to go.
[00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:45.395]  Cheney defends his final throws remarks from three years ago, saying the insurgency was in its final throws just four or five months after the invasion and takeover.
[00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:48.717]  We have an audio clip of him saying it was worse than he thought it would be, though.
[00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:53.760]  It's a very deceptive little speech he gives in answer to a reporter.
[00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:56.242]  Finally, someone asked him a serious question.
[00:03:56.262 --> 00:03:58.503]  I couldn't believe it when I saw the video clip this morning.
[00:03:58.523 --> 00:03:59.924]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:01.065]  We'll be airing the audio here.
[00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:03.227]  Also, three U.S.
[00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:05.129]  soldiers charged four Iraq killings.
[00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.151]  That's proper.
[00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:19.968]  See, the good guys punish bad behavior, and then bad behavior isn't tolerated, and we go back to having a good military and not having a bad name associated with it and our goodwill being flushed down the international toilet.
[00:04:20.308 --> 00:04:22.410]  As the globalists have been attempting to do.
[00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.111]  It's all by design.
[00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:24.872]  Avoid breast cancer.
[00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:25.813]  Sleep in the dark.
[00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.014]  London Independent.
[00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:28.535]  Major scientific studies.
[00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:32.499]  And Blue Peter launches junior ID card schemes.
[00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:39.205]  Some TV show on the BBC for kids promoting national ID cards for them to get into the different live studio audiences.
[00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.569]  And a new test for genetic disorders raises designer baby concerns.
[00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.850]  It tests for hundreds of genetic problems.
[00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.811]  But aren't those really problems?
[00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.332]  What else are those genes associated with?
[00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:54.534]  That mixes into the headline, Animal-Human Cells Get Exotic, as they mix them.
[00:04:55.015 --> 00:04:59.817]  It's all coming up after this quick break, right here on the GCN Radio Network, prisonplanet.com.
[00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:05.727]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.987 --> 00:05:06.688]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:07.569]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.594]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:19.681]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:21.963]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.183 --> 00:05:25.005]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:29.770]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.374]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:41.860]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.522]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.682 --> 00:05:46.424]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:05:49.927 --> 00:05:54.550]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:03.604 --> 00:06:04.625]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:07.747]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:12.169]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:13.430]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.313]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.806 --> 00:06:20.926]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:36.109]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:43.270]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.731]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:49.674]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.487]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:21.153]  We're good to go.
[00:07:36.087 --> 00:07:36.868]  We're good to go.
[00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:06.855]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:08.536]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:10.457]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.017 --> 00:08:11.857]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.578 --> 00:08:14.498]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:18.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.462]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.064 --> 00:08:29.064]  I'm not envious.
[00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:30.205]  I'm not jealous.
[00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:32.406]  I want to be clear on that.
[00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:35.107]  But I am irritated.
[00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:44.732]  World Net Daily, Human Events, put out two stories written by Jerome Corsi concerning the American Union.
[00:08:45.573 --> 00:08:49.274]  We have written who knows how many articles.
[00:08:49.354 --> 00:08:51.475]  It's got to be over 50.
[00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:54.397]  Interviewed hundreds of guests on the subject over the years.
[00:08:54.857 --> 00:08:58.278]  Gotten internal state of Texas and federal documents.
[00:08:58.919 --> 00:08:59.539]  Posted them.
[00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:03.461]  Had, of course, a writer for the
[00:09:04.858 --> 00:09:19.254]  New American Magazine, good personal friend of mine here locally, on Bob Dacey to detail this with many times the facts, many times the information that Jerome Corsi put in his report of a week and a half ago.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.922]  Now, again, I'm glad Jerome Corsi wrote these articles.
[00:09:23.403 --> 00:09:24.583]  I'm glad it's been picked up.
[00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:34.251]  I'm glad that the Associated Press sources their research off of Corsi's article, which itself is sourced to direct U.S.
[00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:36.793]  government websites, .gov websites.
[00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:37.653]  These are admissions.
[00:09:38.694 --> 00:09:42.317]  The American people are in denial about the American Union.
[00:09:43.012 --> 00:09:44.873]  That is, many of those that are aware of it.
[00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:48.535]  Still, many others aren't even aware that it's going on or happening.
[00:09:49.076 --> 00:09:50.176]  So why am I irritated?
[00:09:50.276 --> 00:10:03.344]  It's just that if people would have listened to us years ago, or if the mainstream media would have picked up on our reports years ago, the American Union wouldn't be so far along right now.
[00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:05.950]  And it's the same thing on so many other subjects.
[00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.513]  Training the military for gun confiscations and mass roundups.
[00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:14.156]  FEMA training pastors and local officials for this.
[00:10:15.237 --> 00:10:17.478]  The plan for total blanket amnesty.
[00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:23.503]  We're still having to convince the American people off of Bush's own law that he's introduced in Congress.
[00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:26.789]  It was written up by the Democrats for total amnesty.
[00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:30.392]  We're still having to convince people that, yes, it really is total amnesty.
[00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:36.676]  We're still having to fight with the general public to go read it and look it up and check the facts for themselves.
[00:10:38.157 --> 00:10:42.300]  Again, none of this stuff we talk about, or very seldom, is it secret.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.621]  It's public.
[00:10:44.322 --> 00:10:44.902]  It's there.
[00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:45.863]  It's available.
[00:10:46.023 --> 00:10:47.264]  I know it's unbelievable.
[00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:48.885]  It's hard for me to believe.
[00:10:50.638 --> 00:10:50.898]  I think?
[00:10:50.978 --> 00:10:51.479]  I think?
[00:11:13.516 --> 00:11:16.557]  Didn't even know that the NAFTA highway is already being built.
[00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:18.938]  He said, oh, they start building it next year.
[00:11:19.618 --> 00:11:23.680]  No, Mr. Corsi, they've already built large sections of it.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.182]  In fact, it was even on the cover of Time Magazine last year of all places.
[00:11:28.242 --> 00:11:31.923]  So why did Time Magazine not get any attention on this?
[00:11:32.023 --> 00:11:34.564]  Why was it World Net Daily and Human Events?
[00:11:34.584 --> 00:11:35.285]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:41.387]  Online publications have more power already than publications like Time Magazine.
[00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:48.617]  I've been in Time Magazine, I don't know, three or four times in the last year, Time and Newsweek, almost no response.
[00:11:49.577 --> 00:11:53.901]  But you get picked up in something like Human Events or World Net Daily, you're going to get a response.
[00:11:53.941 --> 00:11:54.622]  And why is that?
[00:11:55.103 --> 00:12:04.511]  Time Magazine still has more readers than a World Net Daily or a Human Events or an InfoWars.com or a PrisonPlanet.com, but it's not active people.
[00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:07.134]  It's the passive sheep, cow people.
[00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:20.150]  Slave, domesticated, gibbering moron or educated idiot that sits there in the dental office or when they're getting their hair cut and just kind of haphazardly flips through.
[00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:25.776]  They're an unconscious population that predominantly gets their news from such rags.
[00:12:27.432 --> 00:12:38.517]  The people surfing the web for news, the news junkies that are totally addicted, are very informed, very intelligent, and they also keep people like myself on our toes.
[00:12:38.557 --> 00:12:39.618]  I better not make mistakes.
[00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:40.918]  I better know what I'm talking about.
[00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:46.481]  I better do my research because I've got millions of readers and millions of listeners that watch my every move.
[00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:52.544]  And now I'm getting off into the alternative media and how it's overtaking the controlled press.
[00:12:54.477 --> 00:12:55.639]  We are the real press.
[00:12:56.119 --> 00:12:57.201]  I'm getting off into other issues.
[00:12:57.241 --> 00:13:03.349]  The point is, the AP sources for its research World Net Daily, which I think is a good thing.
[00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:10.218]  Overall, though it's a quasi-neocon publication now and has a lot of great articles mixed in with a lot of tripe,
[00:13:10.978 --> 00:13:29.227]  I just wish the AP would go do research off of our websites, because all it is is the scans of internal documents that say not for distribution, not for publication, which show the American Union and show the American Union highways and are a lot more hardcore than even what Corsi got off of public government websites.
[00:13:29.247 --> 00:13:34.169]  So my point is that we've got meat and potatoes many times stronger.
[00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:40.742]  Then what Corsi and AP and others are putting out, and I'm inviting you, the listeners, to go get these articles we've written.
[00:13:40.762 --> 00:13:49.709]  In fact, I want Paul Watson and Ryan Slickheisen at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, respectively, to go get these articles, make sure they're on the main page in a section for people.
[00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.250]  This is the hottest issue.
[00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.452]  It's always been a hot issue for Alex Jones.
[00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:56.033]  It's always been a hot issue for you, the listeners that love freedom.
[00:13:56.473 --> 00:13:59.433]  But now the general public is finally going, Huh?
[00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:00.934]  An American Union?
[00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:01.394]  What?
[00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:04.675]  Only them grassy knoll nuts talk about that?
[00:14:04.775 --> 00:14:07.336]  You mean it's really happening?
[00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:14.197]  So continuing here, Bush Superstate documents sought.
[00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:20.719]  Jerome Corsi filed a Freedom of Information Act request yesterday asking for full disclosure of the activities...
[00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:22.966]  I would say we're about 70% into it.
[00:14:45.095 --> 00:14:47.617]  And every month we're two or three more points into it.
[00:14:47.897 --> 00:14:51.880]  We will be in 100% integration within four years.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.821]  Oh, by the way, that's what they say, 2010.
[00:14:54.362 --> 00:14:57.924]  It's not a secret.
[00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:01.087]  You can go watch Galen Ross' American Union by 2005.
[00:15:01.227 --> 00:15:04.709]  It's on prisonplanet.tv for members.
[00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:06.250]  And you'll see him.
[00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.331]  He made that video in 2001.
[00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:13.639]  And you'll see him say American Union by 2005, then he starts reading their own documents.
[00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:24.223]  He then plays a C-SPAN broadcast, clips of it, where they admit they've got Rockefeller and all of them up there saying, we're already in the American Union, and we will be complete by 2005.
[00:15:25.563 --> 00:15:27.664]  You go, well, where is it?
[00:15:27.864 --> 00:15:30.065]  It's been announced in 2005.
[00:15:30.325 --> 00:15:31.345]  They're now setting it up.
[00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.566]  They're a couple years behind, but it will be complete by 2010.
[00:15:33.606 --> 00:15:35.387]  So America is 70% gone right now.
[00:15:39.489 --> 00:15:46.143]  And the open borders, the blanket amnesty, the guest worker program, unlimited, this is all part and parcel of the same thing.
[00:15:48.187 --> 00:15:49.810]  You want to shoot down the open borders...
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:57.004]  You see, the Limbaughs and the Hannibys, they'll tell you all about the open borders problem, but they'll not tell you that it's Bush's fault and that Bush is behind it as a puppet.
[00:15:57.505 --> 00:15:59.926]  Or, they won't explain to you that it's part of an American Union.
[00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:04.790]  They'll sit up there and make jokes and laugh about it and say that it's part of the conspiracy theory crowd.
[00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.530]  Yes.
[00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.332]  The sun came up this morning, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:16:08.572 --> 00:16:11.854]  We read the actual documents and the agreements and the treaties.
[00:16:12.094 --> 00:16:13.155]  Oh, we're so kooky.
[00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:18.719]  Three years ago, they had the first joint session of our Congress in Mexico.
[00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:22.497]  Alright, I'm ranting now.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.960]  This is the Associated Press.
[00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:36.369]  As WorldNet Daily reported, the White House has established working groups under the North American Free Trade Agreement Office and the Department of Commerce to implement the Security and Prosperity Partnership, or SPP.
[00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:42.855]  And again, under NAFTA and GATT and the World Trade Organization, the Commerce Department has been given more authority, I would add, than the Congress.
[00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.051]  It goes on.
[00:16:44.391 --> 00:16:51.338]  Signed by President Bush, Mexican President Vicente Fox, and then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin in Waco, Texas in March 23, 2005.
[00:16:51.598 --> 00:16:54.481]  Well, this AP writer is lazy.
[00:16:55.562 --> 00:16:57.564]  That is an exact quote out of Corsi's article.
[00:16:58.565 --> 00:16:59.146]  Boy, is somebody...
[00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:01.779]  Getting in a little bit of trouble if somebody notices that.
[00:17:02.339 --> 00:17:15.005]  Of course, he specifically has requested the partnership's membership list constitute documents, meeting minutes, meeting agendas, and meeting schedules, as well as all findings, reports, presentations, and memorabilia.
[00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:37.685]  He also wants all comments, representatives of the prosperity working groups, which he was told, by the way, by the government is secret, or other working groups, committees, or task forces associated with the partnerships, along with internal and external interagency and intra-agency memorabilia, memorandum of understanding, letters of intent, agreements, initiatives, and budgeting documents.
[00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:40.446]  Of course, he believes that President Bush effectively agreed to erase U.S.
[00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:42.948]  borders with Mexico and Canada when he signed the SPP.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:56.805]  Gary Word, the administrator in charge of SPP, confirmed in a telephone conversation with Corsi that SPP.gov has not published the membership list of that working group or many trilateral agreements.
[00:17:57.346 --> 00:17:59.827]  The website documents indicate are being implemented.
[00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:04.249]  This is all being done by the executive branch below the radar, Corsi told WorldNetDaily.
[00:18:04.629 --> 00:18:15.014]  Even President Bush had told the American people in the 2004 presidential campaign that the goal to create a North American union, he would not have carried a single red state.
[00:18:16.624 --> 00:18:27.963]  The president, of course he maintains, has charged the bureaucracy to form a North American union through executive fiat without ever disclosing his plans directly to the American people or to the Congress.
[00:18:29.056 --> 00:18:42.181]  Attorney Robert A. McGuire, who filed a request on Corsi's behalf and is preparing further requests, says the President is creating a North American Union government without the full, complete knowledge of the American people.
[00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:44.662]  We are facing a severe constitutional crisis.
[00:18:45.142 --> 00:18:47.883]  Hey, Kevin, get me Robert A. McGuire.
[00:18:47.903 --> 00:18:49.264]  I know you can get Corsi back on.
[00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:51.865]  Get Corsi on in the third hour and try to get his lawyer.
[00:18:54.046 --> 00:18:54.826]  Get him back on, please.
[00:18:55.538 --> 00:19:03.464]  The purpose of the four-year request, he said, is to get full facts exposed in the light of day, available for the American people, for the Congress to examine and decide.
[00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:10.970]  Well, if Bush follows his past activities, they'll put out fake documents, or excise large portions of it, and declare national security.
[00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:16.955]  I mean, when they dump toxic waste on the river now, the corporations get to declare national security under the Patriot Act.
[00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:21.919]  See, this is an umbrella of darkness, so all this wickedness can go on underneath the rocks.
[00:19:23.419 --> 00:19:28.700]  Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican, Colorado, is demanding the Bush administration fully disclose the activities of the SPP office.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.982]  Tancredo wants to know the membership of the SPP groups along with their various trilateral memorabilia.
[00:19:35.002 --> 00:19:36.842]  What's a memorabilia?
[00:19:36.862 --> 00:19:37.882]  It's a memorabilia once.
[00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:44.064]  Memorandum of Understanding and other agreements reached with counterparts in Mexico and Canada.
[00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:56.784]  Many SPP working groups appear to be working toward achieving specific objectives as defined by the May 2005 Council on Foreign Relations Task Force Report, which presented a blueprint for expanding the SPP agreement in the North American Union.
[00:19:57.525 --> 00:19:57.906]  Wow!
[00:19:58.066 --> 00:19:59.669]  The AP talking about the CFR!

[00:21:02.398 --> 00:21:02.838]  Gold.
[00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:04.479]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:10.823]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:14.825]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:15.185 --> 00:21:17.086]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:17.306]  Mint,
[00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:18.266]  We're good to go.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.261]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.801 --> 00:22:03.402]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:03.762 --> 00:22:09.505]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:22:09.765 --> 00:22:14.908]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:22:15.228 --> 00:22:24.513]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:22:24.873 --> 00:22:29.838]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:22:30.139 --> 00:22:34.143]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:22:34.363 --> 00:22:39.128]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:22:39.489 --> 00:22:45.415]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:23:02.253 --> 00:23:06.658]  Local folklore has recognized its amazing medicinal properties for thousands of years.
[00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:12.524]  But no one knew just how to preserve the nutritional benefits and market the total fruit commercially until Zango, that is.
[00:23:12.884 --> 00:23:17.789]  Zango is made from mangosteen, a fruit that grows in the subtropical climates of Southeast Asia.
[00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:22.534]  It contains xanthones, the highest concentration of antioxidants found in nature.
[00:23:22.814 --> 00:23:29.120]  Modern science is only just beginning to unlock the many secrets of Xanthos and their far-reaching potential to improve our health.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.962]  Zango is revolutionary.
[00:23:31.162 --> 00:23:41.172]  Not only has Zango taken the world by storm as an extremely potent functional health beverage, but Zango has become the most exciting and fastest growing home-based business opportunity ever.
[00:23:41.472 --> 00:23:43.614]  Life is short, and timing is everything.

[00:24:04.344 --> 00:24:10.368]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.968 --> 00:24:13.990]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:18.092]  I'm not going to just glaze over this.
[00:24:18.152 --> 00:24:18.673]  Listen to this.
[00:24:19.233 --> 00:24:25.537]  Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican Colorado, is demanding the Bush administration fully disclose the activities of the SPP office.
[00:24:25.617 --> 00:24:32.441]  Tancredo wants to know the membership of the SPP groups, along with their various trilateral memoranda of understanding...
[00:24:33.241 --> 00:24:37.822]  And other agreements reached with counterparts in Mexico and Canada.
[00:24:38.082 --> 00:24:56.505]  Many SPP working groups appear to be working towards achieving specific objectives as defined by a May 2005 Council on Foreign Relations Task Force report which presented a blueprint for expanding the SPP agreement into a North American union that would merge the U.S., Canada, and Mexico into a new governmental forum.
[00:24:57.345 --> 00:24:59.326]  That is the Associated Press.
[00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:01.706]  Now this is historical.
[00:25:02.941 --> 00:25:05.282]  The paragraph I just read is historical.
[00:25:05.302 --> 00:25:06.763]  Do you understand why it's historical?
[00:25:08.083 --> 00:25:15.867]  When Rush Limbaugh and Tim Russert and all these people, and I've seen them all do it, listen to them all do it, make fun of us.
[00:25:17.768 --> 00:25:19.289]  Oh, these crazy people.
[00:25:19.469 --> 00:25:22.330]  They believe a thing called the CFR.
[00:25:24.011 --> 00:25:26.712]  The Council on Foreign Relations runs America.
[00:25:27.472 --> 00:25:28.893]  Oh, they're so crazy.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:40.444]  Why, it's just a group of businessmen and academics and bankers, over 3,000 of them now, the heads of everything, that get together and talk and are friends in secret meetings.
[00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:42.665]  It's no big deal.
[00:25:45.146 --> 00:25:53.049]  But if you read CFR documents going back to 1922, when they founded it, officially in 1924, but it was really set up at Pratt House in 1922,
[00:25:54.221 --> 00:26:16.438]  Their own founding documents that are public, that these sniveling creatures have even released, show that the British government, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the managing think tank for MI5, MI6, and the British Crown, goes back to the Rhodes Scholars, set it up to use the US as an engine of the British Empire.
[00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:36.917]  This is all official, and we've always explained, the CFR writes the policy, and word for word, within months, it is passed as law, it is confirmed by executive order, it is implemented by the bureaucracy.
[00:26:37.938 --> 00:26:45.803]  These guys say jump, and the government, the state governments, the local governments, the federal governments say, how high boss?
[00:26:46.684 --> 00:26:48.205]  They click their heels.
[00:26:49.042 --> 00:27:00.399]  And here is the Associated Press saying, they've gone and looked at it, and they go, oh my goodness, because we've got part of the SPP agreement, we have all these official U.S.
[00:27:00.419 --> 00:27:01.321]  government documents
[00:27:02.749 --> 00:27:05.011]  And now we're seeking even more of them.
[00:27:05.612 --> 00:27:10.215]  And the AP says it does appear that they're implementing the CFR plan.
[00:27:10.555 --> 00:27:12.357]  Yes, exactly!
[00:27:12.957 --> 00:27:14.439]  You can forget our Congress.
[00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:16.080]  You can forget your governors.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.141]  Let me tell you, the CFR runs this country.
[00:27:18.442 --> 00:27:23.826]  Now, by running this country, the Bilderberg Group, 120 people, they make the decisions.
[00:27:25.247 --> 00:27:30.051]  And then the CFR and the Trilateral Commission, they go out and they implement it.
[00:27:30.919 --> 00:27:33.420]  They help develop the plans.
[00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:39.584]  They get all the experts together, and then they also sit in the power positions.
[00:27:39.604 --> 00:27:41.324]  3,400 members now, roughly.
[00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:43.746]  Just 10 years ago, it was 2,400 members.
[00:27:43.786 --> 00:27:45.947]  It's growing because they have to have control over more.
[00:27:47.488 --> 00:27:53.631]  Almost every major head of banking, almost every head of every major university department, all the political science heads are members.
[00:27:55.172 --> 00:27:56.232]  Every major editor.
[00:27:56.972 --> 00:27:57.953]  It's unbelievable.
[00:27:58.373 --> 00:27:59.674]  TV news producers.
[00:28:01.551 --> 00:28:02.531]  Religious leaders.
[00:28:03.712 --> 00:28:07.653]  And they go into these secret meetings and they push world government.
[00:28:08.373 --> 00:28:11.154]  And they have a bi-monthly book they put out that's on newsstands.
[00:28:11.394 --> 00:28:13.575]  It's not in the book sections, it's in the newsstand sections.
[00:28:14.175 --> 00:28:16.196]  And it's even their propaganda.
[00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:20.297]  This is their public face of the CFR, published by the CFR, it's called Foreign Affairs.
[00:28:20.837 --> 00:28:25.078]  And they say in their every issue, one world government, total control.
[00:28:26.259 --> 00:28:29.640]  And they spin it and have all the reasons why and tell you how it's good.
[00:28:32.563 --> 00:28:35.964]  People always say, you know, Alex Jones, how does he predict this?
[00:28:36.444 --> 00:28:37.365]  How did he know this would happen?
[00:28:37.405 --> 00:28:38.245]  How did he know that would happen?
[00:28:38.465 --> 00:28:39.846]  Why, he's got inside knowledge.
[00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:41.126]  And we do have a little bit of that.
[00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:42.066]  We do have some sources.
[00:28:42.747 --> 00:28:45.267]  But more than that, we just follow the CFR.
[00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:51.750]  Now, up until about five, six years ago, the CFR was totally secret, other than their propaganda book every two months.
[00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.431]  Now, over the last six years, they're all over the nightly news.
[00:28:55.471 --> 00:28:56.571]  They're all over C-SPAN.
[00:28:56.851 --> 00:28:58.712]  And they don't just call for world government support.
[00:29:00.589 --> 00:29:07.613]  In their publications or in their documents, now on C-SPAN you can watch them say, we need to use this 9-11 disaster to get a new world order.
[00:29:07.633 --> 00:29:08.873]  We need to take people's freedoms.
[00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.414]  We need the American Union.
[00:29:10.995 --> 00:29:21.040]  And word for word, what they put out in this policy report, which is a regurgitation of all the previous reports, that is now word for word what's in the SPP agreements and what is being done.
[00:29:24.921 --> 00:29:33.767]  But that's not going to stop the neocons and the liberals from getting up on radio and TV and saying, the CFR doesn't run anything or none of you say it does.
[00:29:34.107 --> 00:29:36.889]  Because their job is to pacify mainly conservatives.
[00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:40.111]  If you were a globalist, would you come right out and say I'm a globalist?
[00:29:40.131 --> 00:29:40.271]  No.
[00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:46.215]  You'd pose as a conservative, you'd lie to your listeners, and that's exactly what these people do.
[00:29:46.775 --> 00:29:49.016]  Now, if you like being lied to, just keep buying it.
[00:29:49.317 --> 00:29:49.837]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:52.973]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.493 --> 00:29:55.096]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.017 --> 00:29:58.702]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.949 --> 00:30:07.695]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[00:30:07.935 --> 00:30:10.417]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[00:30:10.598 --> 00:30:13.200]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.084]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[00:30:17.184 --> 00:30:22.289]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[00:30:22.489 --> 00:30:25.692]  You and your family will breathe better, sleep sounder, and have more energy.
[00:30:25.872 --> 00:30:30.155]  Natural salt lamps are available in stunning natural colors and shapes to accent any decor.
[00:30:30.235 --> 00:30:33.157]  The lamps are environmentally friendly, and most important, they're affordable.
[00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:37.120]  Natural salt lamps come with a 100% 60-day satisfaction guarantee.
[00:30:37.241 --> 00:30:47.388]  Visit www.natural-salt-lamps.com That's natural-salt-lamps.com to see the lamps for yourself and experience even more of the wellness tools available.
[00:30:47.489 --> 00:30:50.651]  Breathe easier, feel better, live healthier with a natural salt lamp.
[00:30:50.811 --> 00:30:55.554]  by visiting natural-salt-lamps.com or call 312-224-2710.
[00:30:55.595 --> 00:30:57.236]  That's 312-224-2710.
[00:30:57.616 --> 00:31:05.562]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:05.942 --> 00:31:14.748]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:15.069 --> 00:31:19.732]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:26.934]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:27.334 --> 00:31:39.118]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:39.578 --> 00:31:44.043]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:31:44.223 --> 00:31:46.545]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:46.565 --> 00:31:48.527]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:48.547 --> 00:31:49.749]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.829 --> 00:31:51.290]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.351]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:08.073]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.353 --> 00:32:13.035]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:21.039]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms could be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.319 --> 00:32:28.162]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:28.382 --> 00:32:29.763]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:29.943 --> 00:32:30.423]  We're good to go.
[00:32:54.176 --> 00:32:57.078]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:57.419 --> 00:33:01.181]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:33:02.742 --> 00:33:11.969]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.151 --> 00:33:23.458]  It is not debatable, it is part of the public record, that the Council on Foreign Relations takes its orders directly from the Bilderberg Group
[00:33:24.065 --> 00:33:30.448]  This has even been in CFR and Dolderberg Group leaders' memoirs, like German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
[00:33:32.109 --> 00:33:38.872]  This international private group of royalty and bankers gives direct orders to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:33:38.932 --> 00:33:45.195]  They have similar true ruling governments in every major industrialized nation.
[00:33:46.445 --> 00:33:47.466]  Under similar names.
[00:33:48.047 --> 00:33:51.710]  So your real Senate, your real House, your real Congress.
[00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:53.011]  I want you to understand this.
[00:33:53.072 --> 00:33:54.513]  I'm not saying this for effect.
[00:33:54.593 --> 00:33:55.534]  This is the truth.
[00:33:56.252 --> 00:34:12.466]  Instead of calling Congress, instead of writing letters to Congress, instead of going and even talking to your congressman or woman, seriously, we ought to start calling the CFR, the government, and if we start doing that, then people will realize it's unelected, that it's openly saying we need to get rid of U.S.
[00:34:12.506 --> 00:34:19.172]  sovereignty, that's their main tenet, they have like ten commandments, and that's number one, and then they will be exposed.
[00:34:19.192 --> 00:34:23.276]  You see, secret power needs to operate in the dark.
[00:34:25.368 --> 00:34:27.947]  And if we expose our real government...
[00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.832]  Then we can set up and then we can expose the American Union.
[00:34:31.872 --> 00:34:39.216]  You see, it's hard to fight the American Union because the average American still doesn't know we're already going into it.
[00:34:39.697 --> 00:34:45.380]  As the Europeans didn't know they were going into an American, a European Union until they were already in it.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.682]  Then they said, oh, by the way, it's not an economic bloc, it's a union.
[00:34:48.702 --> 00:34:54.726]  Oh, and we're going to take your free speech away and we're going to take your property rights away and we're going to take your sovereignty away.
[00:34:55.146 --> 00:34:56.227]  It's happening.
[00:34:56.307 --> 00:34:58.068]  The denial needs to end.
[00:34:59.187 --> 00:35:03.111]  And I know that there's not denial with my general listeners, but there's always new listeners.
[00:35:03.131 --> 00:35:06.976]  And I get your emails and you occasionally call and you're still in denial.
[00:35:09.178 --> 00:35:14.824]  And I know even for listeners, I know even for myself, regular listeners, I know it's hard to believe we're in an American Union.
[00:35:15.205 --> 00:35:20.691]  It's hard to believe that about five miles from me, I guess six miles from where I sit, they're building the NAFTA highway.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:28.346]  It's hard to believe they're going to put transponders in every car and tax us the equivalent of $3 plus a gallon, but it's official.
[00:35:28.986 --> 00:35:31.288]  It's hard to believe that they're going to have U.S.
[00:35:31.408 --> 00:35:37.273]  Army on the streets of America at hardened checkpoints everywhere in the U.S., but it's been officially announced and it's happening.
[00:35:37.853 --> 00:35:46.040]  It's hard to believe that the military's been training for over a decade to confiscate your guns and put you in concentration camps, but now it's even in the Houston Chronicle that they're building these centers.
[00:35:46.807 --> 00:35:51.636]  It's hard to believe that Bush is pushing total amnesty of all illegal aliens in perpetuity.
[00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:54.140]  It's hard to believe.
[00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:56.744]  But ladies and gentlemen, it is the truth.
[00:35:58.283 --> 00:36:00.145]  Tony in Arkansas and others, your calls are coming up.
[00:36:00.165 --> 00:36:01.466]  We're going to open the phones up right now.
[00:36:01.766 --> 00:36:02.827]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:36:02.867 --> 00:36:10.913]  I have all the Southerners, Cheney admitting that he didn't think the insurgency would be this bad.
[00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:14.656]  Their own official plan was to create the insurgency.
[00:36:14.696 --> 00:36:15.737]  We'll deal with that.
[00:36:16.297 --> 00:36:17.818]  Again, on record, not my opinion.
[00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:18.699]  It's all on record.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.040]  We just know where to look.
[00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:23.563]  Because, see, the globalists have to communicate with each other.
[00:36:24.127 --> 00:36:26.728]  There's tens of thousands of top managers of this system.
[00:36:26.948 --> 00:36:28.448]  We're a big country, a big region.
[00:36:29.209 --> 00:36:31.489]  So we can get their policy reports.
[00:36:31.569 --> 00:36:33.750]  We can get their implementation plans.
[00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.451]  That's how we know.
[00:36:35.891 --> 00:36:37.751]  Yes, America is dying.
[00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:41.633]  Alright, I'm ranting.
[00:36:43.573 --> 00:36:45.394]  Before we go to Tony in Arkansas and others.
[00:36:46.903 --> 00:36:49.204]  Let's go to Debbie Marr of New Millennium Concepts.
[00:36:49.544 --> 00:36:51.444]  People always talk about how we want Made in America.
[00:36:51.524 --> 00:36:52.364]  Well, here's your chance.
[00:36:52.824 --> 00:36:59.366]  The best, top of the line, least expensive water filtration gravity systems out there.
[00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:01.246]  If you want British, they've got the British Made ones, too.
[00:37:01.266 --> 00:37:02.606]  They're the national distributor of that.
[00:37:03.046 --> 00:37:05.587]  They have the American Made, an even higher standard.
[00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:06.847]  It's what I use in the office.
[00:37:08.728 --> 00:37:11.148]  I think I bought six or seven of these last year to give as gifts.
[00:37:11.988 --> 00:37:14.789]  I've got two in the garage just waiting for an emergency, one in the house.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.141]  We use it for cooking.
[00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:18.001]  We use it for drinking.
[00:37:18.481 --> 00:37:22.884]  After you've been drinking off a Berkey filter, you try to drink tap water, you're like, how did I ever drink this before?
[00:37:24.706 --> 00:37:26.147]  I was in Chicago a few weeks ago.
[00:37:26.227 --> 00:37:28.849]  It literally tasted like gasoline.
[00:37:28.889 --> 00:37:29.969]  I thought Houston was the worst.
[00:37:30.009 --> 00:37:30.310]  No, no.
[00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:31.350]  This was worse.
[00:37:33.352 --> 00:37:35.333]  And they've got wholesale prices.
[00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:42.378]  You buy one unit and you're getting about $100 off on average what you'd buy at a camping supply store or preparedness store.
[00:37:42.858 --> 00:37:43.579]  I'll shut up.
[00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:45.260]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:37:48.018 --> 00:37:48.658]  Do we have Debbie?
[00:37:48.859 --> 00:37:49.419]  Hi, Alex.
[00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:49.919]  I'm here.
[00:37:49.939 --> 00:37:51.520]  I forgot I muted my phone.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.541]  That's okay.
[00:37:52.841 --> 00:37:53.641]  It's good to have you.
[00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:55.582]  We've got hurricane season coming up.
[00:37:56.143 --> 00:37:59.024]  We've got an October surprise the globalists could push.
[00:37:59.084 --> 00:38:02.626]  But that's not my reason for telling people they should get filters.
[00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:04.908]  The crisis is ongoing.
[00:38:05.008 --> 00:38:06.749]  It's in the current water supply.
[00:38:06.789 --> 00:38:08.810]  Debbie, tell us why we need water filtration.
[00:38:09.711 --> 00:38:14.954]  We need to take control of our own environment and what we put in our bodies.
[00:38:15.034 --> 00:38:15.594]  That's why.
[00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:16.495]  And...
[00:38:17.782 --> 00:38:34.031]  By filtering your own water, you know what you're getting and you're not just taking it for granted by what the different people are telling you is in the bottled water you can buy at the grocery store or those big things, you know, that you go to the health food store and fill up your own jugs.
[00:38:34.592 --> 00:38:40.315]  How do you know how often they clean those machines and what they're really doing if you filter your own water?
[00:38:40.768 --> 00:38:44.250]  You absolutely know what you're getting when you drink it.
[00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.913]  Plus, it's more expensive to buy it out of the big machines.
[00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:48.653]  It is.
[00:38:48.734 --> 00:38:49.794]  It's way more expensive.
[00:38:50.114 --> 00:38:57.940]  Berkeys pay for themselves in literally no time at all because you're not going out buying bottled water day in and day out.
[00:38:58.496 --> 00:39:03.779]  You know, wrecking your bag, carrying all those big, you know, five-gallon and ten-gallon things.
[00:39:04.499 --> 00:39:06.140]  It takes two minutes to put a Berkey together.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.261]  It's so easy.
[00:39:07.341 --> 00:39:08.421]  A five-year-old could do it.
[00:39:09.102 --> 00:39:13.164]  And all the time there's bottled water recalls because the big filters get dirty.
[00:39:13.444 --> 00:39:14.484]  They have a malfunction.
[00:39:14.524 --> 00:39:15.405]  They don't notice it.
[00:39:15.885 --> 00:39:17.566]  You know, thousands of bottles get filled.
[00:39:17.586 --> 00:39:18.366]  The people drink it.
[00:39:18.386 --> 00:39:25.550]  There have been national studies, even in the mainstream news, about how bacteria growth in bottled water, because it may be on the shelf six months, is off the charts.
[00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.032]  Statistically, bottled water, in many cases, is worse than tap water.
[00:39:30.132 --> 00:39:31.833]  If that's actually possible, yes it is.
[00:39:33.874 --> 00:39:35.155]  Debbie, folks need to call you.
[00:39:35.195 --> 00:39:36.115]  Tell us about the specials.
[00:39:36.135 --> 00:39:39.337]  They need to make this life decision, especially if you have children.
[00:39:39.357 --> 00:39:41.638]  I mean, if you want to drink poison, go ahead and knock yourselves out.
[00:39:41.898 --> 00:39:43.199]  But what about your children, folks?
[00:39:43.962 --> 00:39:44.522]  That's right.
[00:39:44.902 --> 00:39:45.462]  Absolutely.
[00:39:45.503 --> 00:39:50.924]  And please do not buy that water that they put on the shelves now that says for babies.
[00:39:51.344 --> 00:39:53.385]  And they add fluoride to the water.
[00:39:53.405 --> 00:39:56.066]  And it's right on the shelves at the grocery store now.
[00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:57.926]  It's in a pink label.
[00:39:57.946 --> 00:40:03.928]  And they have national newscasts saying your child needs extra fluoride and your child needs mercury for their brain.
[00:40:03.948 --> 00:40:05.649]  Mercury's nutritious.
[00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:07.889]  We're not joking, folks.
[00:40:07.929 --> 00:40:09.510]  They actually say mercury's good.
[00:40:11.806 --> 00:40:12.467]  I'm sorry, Debbie.
[00:40:12.487 --> 00:40:16.749]  You know, it's not hard for me to have such a hard sell here because I believe in this.
[00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.410]  It's made in America.
[00:40:18.451 --> 00:40:19.771]  It supports this broadcast.
[00:40:19.971 --> 00:40:21.572]  You get massive discount prices.
[00:40:21.853 --> 00:40:25.475]  I want your telephones to literally blow off the wall and start burning.
[00:40:25.515 --> 00:40:26.576]  There's so many phone calls.
[00:40:26.876 --> 00:40:28.497]  I want the phone lines red hot.
[00:40:28.757 --> 00:40:30.978]  People calling you right now to get these filters.
[00:40:31.018 --> 00:40:32.119]  Tell them about some of the specials.
[00:40:32.749 --> 00:40:33.990]  We have a new special.
[00:40:34.831 --> 00:40:42.657]  We have the Berkey light with lights or the Royal Berkey, Imperial Berkey, or Crown Berkey.
[00:40:42.677 --> 00:40:55.907]  And with that, you can get our new LED flashlight that has a five-function smart switch on it to control the amount of power that comes out of the flashlight.
[00:40:55.947 --> 00:40:56.988]  It's brand new.
[00:40:57.548 --> 00:41:00.791]  We just added it to our inventory today.
[00:41:01.149 --> 00:41:10.438]  And we'd like to give those away free to callers that get either a Berkey light with lights or a Royal or an Imperial or a Crown Berkey.
[00:41:10.458 --> 00:41:13.141]  Of course, they can always buy the flashlight for $29.
[00:41:16.304 --> 00:41:26.293]  And we also have several other new little flashlights that you can put on your keychain so that you can see in the dark to open your front door and things like that.
[00:41:26.713 --> 00:41:30.456]  And we do have a flashlight special that's a combination of all that together.
[00:41:30.516 --> 00:41:38.102]  Now, you've still got the deal for $195 or is it $199 to get the standard Berkey with the black elements for $195 or $199?
[00:41:38.143 --> 00:41:40.404]  $199, and you still get a free Berkey Sport bottle with that.
[00:41:43.803 --> 00:41:45.064]  The generic labeled ones.
[00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:47.767]  And people just love those sport bottles.
[00:41:47.807 --> 00:41:51.030]  And we do have the five Berkey sport bottles for $99.
[00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.954]  So give us a call, and we'll be glad to get your orders shipped right away.
[00:41:56.014 --> 00:41:59.958]  We are still shipping within a day or two right now.
[00:42:00.418 --> 00:42:08.626]  As the season goes on and people start calling more because of the crises that will be happening, you know, sometimes it takes longer to ship.
[00:42:08.886 --> 00:42:09.386]  I hear you.
[00:42:09.406 --> 00:42:10.627]  Debbie, let me give people the number.
[00:42:10.707 --> 00:42:11.308]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:15.250]  Write it down, folks.
[00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.651]  1-888-803-4438.

[00:42:20.374 --> 00:42:22.515]  And then in the comments section, tell them what free gift you want.
[00:42:22.535 --> 00:42:23.796]  The flashlight, the sports bottle.
[00:42:24.156 --> 00:42:25.056]  Whatever you want right there.
[00:42:25.096 --> 00:42:25.657]  It's all listed.

[00:42:31.639 --> 00:42:34.820]  So order at InfoWars.com via our safe, secure Yahoo shopping cart.

[00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:39.682]  Or call 1-888-803-4438.
[00:42:39.942 --> 00:42:40.863]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[00:42:40.883 --> 00:42:41.463]  Thank you.
[00:42:41.483 --> 00:42:41.843]  Bye-bye.
[00:42:41.863 --> 00:42:42.203]  You bet.
[00:42:42.263 --> 00:42:42.744]  God bless.
[00:42:43.204 --> 00:42:44.904]  Folks, it's so important to do this.
[00:42:44.925 --> 00:42:47.586]  888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:42:47.606 --> 00:42:47.686]  Okay.
[00:42:51.934 --> 00:42:53.796]  Let's shift gears back into the American Union.
[00:42:53.896 --> 00:42:55.257]  I'm very excited.
[00:42:55.297 --> 00:43:10.792]  The Associated Press saying clearly that the Council on Foreign Relations puts out a report in May of 2005, and within three months it is implemented by Executive Fiat by the...
[00:43:12.079 --> 00:43:16.580]  The Prime Minister of Canada, the President of the United States, and the President of Mexico.
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:31.084]  Now, they already set the table, set up the agreements, lined it all up, set up the offices, then they sign the agreements and say it's secret, but then they have to implement the agreement, so much of it is hidden in plain view on the SPP.gov website and other U.S.
[00:43:31.124 --> 00:43:31.724]  government websites.
[00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:37.286]  And then we got internal text doc documents, and we got stuff off the Texas Department of Transportation documents,
[00:43:37.586 --> 00:43:38.066]  We're good to go.
[00:44:06.778 --> 00:44:18.662]  That goes into Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, splits off into Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, New York, up into Canada, up into Toronto, up into Ottawa, all the way up into Alaska.
[00:44:18.682 --> 00:44:25.585]  Of course he's looking at maps they've got on the SPP.gov site that have it running up into mid-Canada, down into northern Mexico.
[00:44:26.885 --> 00:44:29.006]  It runs all the way to Chile.
[00:44:30.023 --> 00:44:36.744]  And all the way to Alaska, and it takes existing roads and hands it over to these people.
[00:44:37.124 --> 00:44:39.205]  And these are international bodies.
[00:44:40.645 --> 00:44:41.965]  Spain's being given our roads.
[00:44:42.085 --> 00:44:43.545]  Germany, England, the Dutch.
[00:44:44.285 --> 00:44:47.006]  Mexico is being given giant railway stations in St.
[00:44:47.046 --> 00:44:47.966]  Louis and Kansas.
[00:44:48.346 --> 00:44:49.686]  Hundreds of miles of track.
[00:44:50.166 --> 00:44:51.827]  These are international zones.
[00:44:52.027 --> 00:44:53.607]  This is actually happening.
[00:44:53.807 --> 00:44:54.967]  And who's given these zones?
[00:44:55.387 --> 00:44:56.668]  The United Arab Emirates.
[00:44:56.788 --> 00:44:58.348]  The Communist Chinese government.
[00:44:58.748 --> 00:44:59.348]  Mexico.
[00:45:00.052 --> 00:45:01.653]  This is what we're talking about.
[00:45:01.713 --> 00:45:02.473]  The sellout.
[00:45:02.854 --> 00:45:08.957]  Just like 150 years ago, the Western powers divided up China into, what, nine regions?
[00:45:09.417 --> 00:45:16.641]  They are literally colonizing and breaking up, and that's why the Supreme Court's come out and said, if private interests want your land, they take it.
[00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:27.186]  Are you starting to understand that the CFR that implements for the big banks and the Anglo-American establishment, the British Crown...
[00:45:29.668 --> 00:45:33.830]  Comes in with international law to get rid of your sovereignty, to get rid of your protections.
[00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.992]  The international government they're creating is run by private boards.
[00:45:38.613 --> 00:45:45.477]  1995, the World Trade Organization is created, has more authority at its birth, now 11 years later, over our Congress and our decisions.
[00:45:46.597 --> 00:45:47.318]  And what are they doing?
[00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:49.379]  Seeding all of our sovereignty.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:57.303]  And then somebody calls in yesterday and says, well, I hear that an American Union will help our economy and we can pool our resources and defeat China.
[00:45:58.186 --> 00:46:00.209]  This is designed to de-industrialize us.
[00:46:00.269 --> 00:46:02.852]  It's designed to bring in more regulation and more taxation.
[00:46:03.113 --> 00:46:05.456]  It's designed to shift more of our jobs overseas.
[00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:06.217]  Don't you understand?
[00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:09.521]  The very people that set up the China deal are the ones setting this up.
[00:46:09.882 --> 00:46:13.026]  But they tell you it's for the economy, and you believe it?
[00:46:15.023 --> 00:46:16.804]  Tony in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[00:46:17.184 --> 00:46:19.025]  Alex, it's an honor to speak with you always.
[00:46:19.225 --> 00:46:20.325]  Good to talk to you.
[00:46:20.725 --> 00:46:23.646]  I had a quick question, if I could.
[00:46:23.666 --> 00:46:29.308]  I have a friend, an associate, who I got, he and his wife, to start listening to your program about a year and a half ago.
[00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:31.689]  He's recently retired from the Walt Disney Corporation.
[00:46:31.709 --> 00:46:33.310]  He was a senior vice president with them.
[00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:39.672]  How is it possible if someone wanted to get in touch with you and Jimmy Walters, how could he do that?
[00:46:42.774 --> 00:46:48.486]  Well, you would just, the best way is send me a letter or email me your phone number and tell us what it's concerning.
[00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:49.850]  Okay.
[00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.492]  Right now we're so busy, I literally didn't even have time to shave this morning.
[00:46:53.512 --> 00:47:03.216]  I did brush my teeth, and I just toweled my hair off with a towel, and literally got dressed in about probably 120 seconds.
[00:47:03.796 --> 00:47:07.538]  So after this big conference is a good time to get in touch with me.
[00:47:07.778 --> 00:47:08.498]  Okay, all right.
[00:47:08.538 --> 00:47:14.781]  So we're members of Prison Plan TV, too, and just use your email there, and that could do it.
[00:47:14.841 --> 00:47:15.421]  It'll get to you.
[00:47:15.581 --> 00:47:15.761]  Sure.
[00:47:16.241 --> 00:47:18.142]  Okay, well, we appreciate that, and God bless you.
[00:47:18.442 --> 00:47:19.202]  And when is the conference?
[00:47:19.222 --> 00:47:20.202]  This weekend, or is it?
[00:47:20.342 --> 00:47:20.982]  Yeah, this weekend.
[00:47:21.082 --> 00:47:22.183]  This weekend.
[00:47:22.383 --> 00:47:23.303]  We'll be praying for you all.
[00:47:23.623 --> 00:47:24.483]  Thank you so much.
[00:47:24.963 --> 00:47:25.703]  It's going to be great.
[00:47:26.604 --> 00:47:28.884]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[00:47:30.725 --> 00:47:32.265]  Andrew in Japan.
[00:47:32.325 --> 00:47:33.045]  Welcome, Andrew.
[00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:34.846]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:35.226 --> 00:47:35.526]  Hi.
[00:47:37.286 --> 00:47:39.227]  It's great to finally talk to you.
[00:47:39.307 --> 00:47:41.308]  I'm a first-time caller, so.
[00:47:41.608 --> 00:47:42.928]  Are you calling on an IP phone?
[00:47:44.028 --> 00:47:46.090]  Yeah, actually, is it breaking up?
[00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:47.811]  No, it's just there's a second delay.
[00:47:47.851 --> 00:47:48.192]  Go ahead.
[00:47:48.212 --> 00:47:50.173]  Okay, sorry about that.
[00:47:51.054 --> 00:47:52.135]  No, no, I'm glad you called.
[00:47:52.155 --> 00:47:54.016]  Don't worry about it.
[00:47:54.036 --> 00:47:54.517]  Just go ahead.
[00:47:55.918 --> 00:48:06.107]  I'm a native of Canada, and first of all, I just want to say I can't express how sad I am at your treatment.
[00:48:06.527 --> 00:48:09.710]  I mean, I know that it was actually at the hands of...
[00:48:10.831 --> 00:48:18.474]  The Bilderbergs, but just the fact that the Canadian police would treat you like that is just... It's not common anyway.
[00:48:18.494 --> 00:48:21.996]  A lot of my relatives are police.
[00:48:22.056 --> 00:48:23.496]  My neighbor is a policewoman.
[00:48:23.556 --> 00:48:28.939]  And all of them that I know, they're really upstanding people.
[00:48:29.019 --> 00:48:32.040]  Well, they admitted that the, quote, conference was concerned about me.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.362]  So it was on orders of Bilderberg Group.
[00:48:37.082 --> 00:48:38.263]  Yeah, just one other thing I...
[00:48:39.434 --> 00:48:50.138]  What I wanted to mention is that just the relationships that I'm seeing in the ways of media control between Canada and Japan right now are really close.
[00:48:50.238 --> 00:48:58.101]  I mean, I'm sure you've heard about Stephen Harper, who, in case anyone doesn't know, is the so-called Prime Minister of Canada right now.
[00:48:58.202 --> 00:49:01.223]  And a so-called conservative, but he's a member of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:49:02.343 --> 00:49:02.943]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:02.963 --> 00:49:05.324]  Well, I know his top assistant is.
[00:49:06.165 --> 00:49:06.585]  I didn't know.
[00:49:06.625 --> 00:49:07.745]  No, he's attended.
[00:49:07.765 --> 00:49:08.426]  That's on record.
[00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:09.206]  He's been photographed.
[00:49:11.397 --> 00:49:20.982]  Well, I've just been noticing that they're both really closing this sort of media vice, if you could call it that.
[00:49:21.883 --> 00:49:40.093]  In Canada, Stephen Harper has successfully basically shunned the media, or any media that he doesn't want to talk to, and barred the press from certain parts of the House, which is before it was
[00:49:40.828 --> 00:49:48.494]  It was an open government, and now we're sliding towards this secretive, shadowy sort of dealings going on.
[00:49:48.554 --> 00:49:54.019]  Like he said, we don't have a right to know when his cabinet meets when clearly we should.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.662]  Everything is going in that direction.
[00:49:57.762 --> 00:50:00.264]  Governments are circling the wagons against the people.
[00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:03.667]  Just one more quick thing about Japan.
[00:50:03.687 --> 00:50:06.529]  They've got a guy in charge here named Koizumi.
[00:50:06.949 --> 00:50:07.229]  Yes.
[00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.550]  And...
[00:50:09.315 --> 00:50:11.797]  He's trying to take away the people's right to protest, right?
[00:50:12.517 --> 00:50:17.041]  They have a constitution here as well, obviously, and he's trying to take away their right to protest.
[00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:28.870]  And the kicker, or the funny part, or I guess it's not that funny, but it's strange, is that before he tried to introduce that bill, he tried to introduce another one,
[00:50:29.454 --> 00:50:33.117]  That would make media coverage of constitutional changes illegal.
[00:50:33.557 --> 00:50:35.679]  Well, I saw that in the news a few months ago.
[00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:40.523]  Also, Canada has similar laws where they can order the press not to cover something.
[00:50:40.883 --> 00:50:47.988]  That's now happened with the so-called investigation and trial of the 17 terrorists because all of that is staged.
[00:50:48.048 --> 00:50:51.191]  Just like the same day they had a raid in England claiming they caught terrorists.
[00:50:51.611 --> 00:50:53.953]  Turned out it was all made up and they shot an innocent person.
[00:50:54.273 --> 00:50:55.955]  Thanks for the call from Japan.
[00:50:55.975 --> 00:50:57.636]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[00:51:02.074 --> 00:51:08.917]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:09.217 --> 00:51:10.597]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.777 --> 00:51:12.978]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:13.138 --> 00:51:15.239]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.499 --> 00:51:20.461]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:24.803]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:25.063 --> 00:51:26.844]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.904 --> 00:51:37.569]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.

[00:56:03.321 --> 00:56:03.661]  $5.95 a month.
[00:56:04.582 --> 00:56:07.504]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:56:07.544 --> 00:56:10.867]  Let's talk to Kevin in New York and Charles, Steve, Leo, and others.
[00:56:11.147 --> 00:56:11.807]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[00:56:11.967 --> 00:56:15.090]  You know how you're always talking about militaries and the police?
[00:56:16.283 --> 00:56:20.946]  Yeah, they're going to use, I guess, the National Guard to help the police in New Orleans right now.
[00:56:21.246 --> 00:56:32.473]  Well, the New York State, they always like their troopers to give preference to military and college for recruiting when they bring troopers in.
[00:56:33.414 --> 00:56:36.216]  They would give anybody who had military experience.
[00:56:37.096 --> 00:56:53.421]  Well, that's because they follow orders, and they've got all the new gun confiscation training, and a very large portion of our new police recruits, not just state police, but federal and local, are former military, which I don't have an overall problem with if our military wasn't being turned into something very bad.
[00:56:53.701 --> 00:57:03.765]  Yeah, and then years ago, back in the late 80s, early 90s, Mario Cuomo changed them from revolvers to Glock 9mms.
[00:57:05.427 --> 00:57:08.689]  Well, I don't have a problem with the police having good weapons.
[00:57:09.229 --> 00:57:14.572]  The problem is a lot of cops aren't good with those handguns, and a revolver is a lot more trusty.
[00:57:14.912 --> 00:57:15.132]  Yeah.
[00:57:15.612 --> 00:57:18.054]  And then you talk about this highway business.
[00:57:18.514 --> 00:57:27.059]  They want to build a rooftop expressway here linking two interstates across the north country up here in northern New York.
[00:57:28.499 --> 00:57:31.701]  In the next few years, Charlie Schumer is promoting that idea.
[00:57:31.961 --> 00:57:32.862]  Yeah, Chuckie Schumer.
[00:57:33.022 --> 00:57:33.222]  Yes.
[00:57:33.914 --> 00:57:35.015]  He carries a gun, too.
[00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:37.417]  Do you know that?
[00:57:37.558 --> 00:57:42.082]  He's for total gun confiscation, but he carries a handgun and has a protective detail.
[00:57:42.362 --> 00:57:42.923]  Yes, of course.
[00:57:43.383 --> 00:57:45.165]  And he's got the permit in New York City.
[00:57:45.205 --> 00:57:50.230]  You can go anywhere in the state, but if you have a permit in the state, you can't go in New York City.
[00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:57.234]  Well, I guess it was about six, seven years ago, Sarah Brady got broken into in San Francisco, and she shot the person.
[00:57:57.274 --> 00:57:58.315]  But that's okay.
[00:57:58.335 --> 00:58:01.977]  See, they're going to have guns, because they're the masters, we're the slaves.
[00:58:02.418 --> 00:58:03.418]  Slaves are disarmed.
[00:58:03.458 --> 00:58:04.019]  It's real simple.
[00:58:04.299 --> 00:58:15.826]  We're going into slavery at every level, every signpost, every signature, every sign, every indicator of a classical police state with a high-tech overlay grid is being put in place.
[00:58:15.866 --> 00:58:17.067]  Thanks for the call from New York.
[00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:19.861]  We'll come back, take more calls.
[00:58:19.901 --> 00:58:25.923]  Jimmy Walter has been in Japan, he's been in Malaysia, he's been all over Asia, exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:58:25.943 --> 00:58:29.344]  He's one of our speakers coming up this weekend in Los Angeles.
[00:58:29.784 --> 00:58:33.985]  By the way, our press release is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for the conference.
[00:58:34.325 --> 00:58:36.645]  Please get it out to old radio and TV in your area.
[00:58:36.945 --> 00:58:38.586]  Help us get the press out there.
[00:58:42.107 --> 00:58:46.408]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[00:58:57.987 --> 00:58:58.627]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.287 --> 00:59:00.348]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.048 --> 00:59:02.168]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.808 --> 00:59:03.629]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.389 --> 00:59:05.269]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.289 --> 00:59:09.831]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.131 --> 00:59:14.253]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.394 --> 00:59:20.075]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:59:22.953 --> 00:59:24.795]  Jimmy Walter joins us.
[00:59:25.315 --> 00:59:34.923]  We'll go to your calls early in this hour for Charles and Steve and Leo and Chris and Dan and others that are holding the big news.
[00:59:34.963 --> 00:59:42.189]  Associated Press admits that the Council on Foreign Relations has written the agreements that are being implemented by Executive Fiat to create the American Union.
[00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:48.048]  Dick Cheney admits that he, quote, misunderstood how bad the insurgency would be.
[00:59:48.088 --> 00:59:48.808]  That's a total lie.
[00:59:48.828 --> 00:59:51.749]  Their official plan was to create and foster an insurgency.
[00:59:51.769 --> 00:59:52.669]  We have their own documents.
[00:59:54.270 --> 01:00:02.673]  We have Jerome Corsi joining us to talk about the American Union and his lawsuit for a four-year request coming up with his lawyer in the third hour.
[01:00:02.693 --> 01:00:04.714]  We're also working on getting David Stahl.
[01:00:05.447 --> 01:00:07.728]  Who's been exposing the American Union as well.
[01:00:08.408 --> 01:00:10.449]  Right now, we are joined by Jimmy Walter.
[01:00:10.469 --> 01:00:15.992]  Jimmy Walter spent over $7 million running radio, TV, and newsprint ads all over the country, but focusing mainly on New York.
[01:00:16.901 --> 01:00:21.262]  And he has decided to focus internationally and has been traveling the world globetrotting.
[01:00:21.562 --> 01:00:26.644]  He was recently in Japan the last few weeks and in Malaysia, where they were all over national TV, radio, and print.
[01:00:26.984 --> 01:00:29.805]  He even spoke to members of the Japanese Parliament.
[01:00:30.185 --> 01:00:34.866]  Joining us now from, I guess he's in San Francisco, is Jimmy Walter.
[01:00:34.906 --> 01:00:35.906]  Jimmy, thanks for joining us.
[01:00:36.307 --> 01:00:37.647]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[01:00:38.317 --> 01:00:39.218]  You bet, my friend.
[01:00:40.379 --> 01:00:48.526]  Run down, just in the few minutes we've got before break, run down why you shifted to an international focus and where you've been in the last few months.
[01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:53.230]  Well, we're getting nowhere here in the United States.
[01:00:53.810 --> 01:01:05.821]  Still today, the Congress, the District Attorneys, the Attorney Generals, the Attorney General for the United States ignore the obvious evidence
[01:01:06.371 --> 01:01:09.454]  That the buildings in New York City were brought down with explosives.
[01:01:10.055 --> 01:01:17.082]  They've come out with evidence that actually shows that a 757 did not hit the Pentagon.
[01:01:17.762 --> 01:01:22.147]  And yet every national newscaster claims that it did.
[01:01:22.727 --> 01:01:27.252]  And so I've tried to start getting an international investigation started.
[01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.694]  We were in Venezuela, as you know.
[01:01:29.734 --> 01:01:38.597]  We talked to you a few months back, and we would be returning there probably next month, July, to get an investigation started there.
[01:01:38.617 --> 01:01:41.778]  Excuse me.
[01:01:41.838 --> 01:01:55.423]  But we were invited to go to the International Islamic Fair in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where we, along with myself, William Rodriguez,
[01:01:56.272 --> 01:02:08.080]  Michael Collins-Piper and Matthias Chung gave presentations on the involvement of 9-1-1 and other international crimes that have been committed.
[01:02:09.181 --> 01:02:10.982]  We were warmly received.
[01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:25.252]  We got to meet with Tung Dr. M, the former premier of Malaysia, a very honorable man, and now runs a global peace foundation.
[01:02:26.398 --> 01:02:28.939]  And we were well received.
[01:02:30.359 --> 01:02:32.879]  In fact, William was there.
[01:02:33.379 --> 01:02:36.820]  He and the Islamic group marched on the U.S.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:47.402]  Embassy and 100 of them, which were met by 200 policemen, to present a petition to the U.S.
[01:02:47.462 --> 01:02:49.962]  Embassy to reopen the 9-1-1 investigation.
[01:02:50.542 --> 01:02:52.263]  Their U.N.
[01:02:52.963 --> 01:02:53.443]  diplomat
[01:02:55.786 --> 01:03:00.869]  Also received and said that he cannot longer believe the official story.
[01:03:02.289 --> 01:03:24.280]  Confronting the Evidence was played on Malaysian TV for an hour over three or four nights and has had a huge effect on how the Malaysian population looks at this situation, this obvious crime to subvert the whole United States Constitution for Middle East oil.
[01:03:25.476 --> 01:03:38.182]  I spoke in particular there about the fact that the Arabs and Islam are being widely trashed in order to set up for a new attack on Iraq.
[01:03:38.202 --> 01:03:39.282]  Stay there, Iran.
[01:03:39.362 --> 01:03:39.782]  Stay there.
[01:03:39.842 --> 01:03:40.603]  I want to get into this.
[01:03:40.663 --> 01:03:42.924]  Also, you went to Japan and talked to members of their parliament.
[01:03:43.024 --> 01:03:44.364]  Stay with us, Jimmy Walter.
[01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.685]  This is really important information.
[01:03:46.705 --> 01:03:49.066]  We'll be back after this quick break to get into more detail.
[01:03:49.687 --> 01:03:51.948]  Our websites are Infowars.com and JonesReport.com.
[01:03:54.361 --> 01:04:01.750]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:06.756]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.997 --> 01:04:12.644]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.884 --> 01:04:17.386]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.626 --> 01:04:24.768]  The casual society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:29.330]  oil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:31.991]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[01:04:32.231 --> 01:04:38.933]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:04:39.173 --> 01:04:44.439]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:44.880]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.197]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.517 --> 01:04:59.298]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.558 --> 01:05:03.719]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.159 --> 01:05:04.980]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:09.881]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.361 --> 01:05:12.482]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.962 --> 01:05:13.842]  Sheltering in place.
[01:05:14.266 --> 01:05:15.027]  We're good to go.
[01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:40.188]  That's 888-803-4438
[01:05:53.433 --> 01:05:57.516]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[01:06:47.981 --> 01:07:00.989]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:04.572]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.598 --> 01:07:19.766]  Jimmy Walter, the philanthropist who spent over $7 million exposing 9-11 as an inside job, giving out hundreds and hundreds of thousands of copies of free DVDs exposing 9-11, a documentary he produced.
[01:07:20.598 --> 01:07:20.998]  We're good to go.
[01:07:21.018 --> 01:07:21.218]  I think?
[01:07:49.827 --> 01:07:51.668]  Neocon events and fake liberal events.
[01:07:52.848 --> 01:08:01.671]  We know that they've done these huge hour and a half long hit pieces on myself on Washington Journal with professors and government wonks, pumps on TV attacking me.
[01:08:02.391 --> 01:08:05.492]  Brian Lamb, who runs C-SPAN, will never let me come on and respond.
[01:08:05.812 --> 01:08:08.093]  So start calling into C-SPAN tomorrow.
[01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:11.673]  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, I'm asking you to do this, listeners.
[01:08:11.693 --> 01:08:12.513]  I've never done this before.
[01:08:12.893 --> 01:08:15.455]  And telling them, hey, cover Alex Jones' 9-11 event.
[01:08:15.715 --> 01:08:16.916]  Why won't you send a camera?
[01:08:16.956 --> 01:08:17.896]  Why won't you cover it?
[01:08:18.157 --> 01:08:19.598]  Why won't you cover one of the speeches?
[01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:21.078]  Why won't you come cover Jimmy Walter?
[01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.160]  Why don't you come cover Stephen Jones?
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.201]  Why don't you come cover William Rodriguez?
[01:08:26.242 --> 01:08:31.885]  Why don't you come cover any of these prominent people that are going to be at this event?
[01:08:32.871 --> 01:08:41.593]  All of these scholars, professors, former government officials that are going to be there, that are going to be covering this event, you need to do it.
[01:08:41.953 --> 01:08:43.273]  You need to cover it.
[01:08:43.573 --> 01:08:45.614]  This is so vitally important.
[01:08:46.454 --> 01:08:56.916]  Now, Jimmy Walter, shifting gears back to my first question, because you went right into Malaysia and the huge success there, and your film airing on national television, and speaking to the former prime minister,
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.482]  All of that is important, but I want to go back to this international trail you've been weaving.
[01:09:01.742 --> 01:09:07.166]  Tell us some of the countries that you and one of the heroes of 9-11, William Rodriguez, where you've gone.
[01:09:07.226 --> 01:09:09.087]  Give us kind of the travel guide.
[01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:12.089]  We've been all over Western Europe.
[01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:22.755]  We've been to London, Manchester, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, Madrid, Caracas.
[01:09:23.796 --> 01:09:25.878]  Kuala Lumpur and Japan.
[01:09:26.018 --> 01:09:30.581]  And we're going to go back to Japan on October 7th for a big conference that we're going to be holding there.
[01:09:31.982 --> 01:09:35.585]  But I wanted to say something back to you about C-SPAN.
[01:09:36.526 --> 01:09:42.570]  C-SPAN had me on once back when I first ran the ads, and they tried to make me look like a silly boy.
[01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:47.514]  They said, well, what would your father say if he saw you spending his money that way?
[01:09:48.223 --> 01:09:49.844]  I mean, really low blow.
[01:09:49.864 --> 01:09:55.566]  And of course, I backed him right down and told him my father would be proud of me spending my money to defend this country.
[01:09:56.286 --> 01:10:04.089]  But you can't trust C-SPAN as far as I'm concerned after the way they tried intentionally to make me look like a bumbling fool.
[01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:09.171]  But at any rate, in Malaysia, we asked Dr. M...
[01:10:12.017 --> 01:10:14.518]  To also join the international investigation.
[01:10:14.858 --> 01:10:16.198]  We want to get Bolivia.
[01:10:16.658 --> 01:10:18.018]  We want to get Cuba.
[01:10:18.099 --> 01:10:19.419]  We want to get Uruguay.
[01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:20.379]  We want to get Chile.
[01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:21.939]  We want to get Brazil.
[01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:28.541]  As many countries in Latin America as we can and around the world make this a truly international investigation.
[01:10:28.981 --> 01:10:37.883]  Because under international law, when a country where a terrorist event like this happens, a huge crime like this happens, if the other country's
[01:10:38.907 --> 01:10:55.373]  If the host country does not do a real investigation, then the other countries who lost citizens, I think there were 97 or 100 different countries that lost citizens in the World Trade Center collapses, they have a right to do their own international investigation.
[01:10:55.974 --> 01:10:57.754]  In Japan, I went to Japan.
[01:10:57.794 --> 01:11:00.515]  William stayed on in KL, but I went on to Japan.
[01:11:01.035 --> 01:11:04.997]  I spoke to three members of the Diet, their parliament,
[01:11:05.544 --> 01:11:11.370]  As well as nearly 100 staff from the other members who couldn't make it up.
[01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:17.335]  I had overwhelming acceptance of what I showed.
[01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:26.264]  We had people dropping their jaws because the media in Japan, as is some of the media in Kuala Lumpur, is controlled by the CIA.
[01:11:26.744 --> 01:11:28.085]  The CIA went into Europe.
[01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:29.166]  That's another thing in Europe.
[01:11:31.161 --> 01:11:36.264]  Newspapers in Berlin, Paris, and London would not even let me run ads for my event.
[01:11:36.324 --> 01:11:39.485]  They wouldn't take my money to run an ad for my event.
[01:11:39.586 --> 01:11:43.047]  And this shows you the extent of media control around the world.
[01:11:43.187 --> 01:11:47.189]  The CIA has been infiltrating media ever since 1946.
[01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:49.871]  By the way, that's publicly admitted.
[01:11:49.951 --> 01:11:50.751]  Billions a year.
[01:11:50.831 --> 01:11:53.633]  Now they're spending billions a year openly on domestic lies.
[01:11:54.133 --> 01:11:54.733]  Yes, well...
[01:11:56.041 --> 01:11:59.422]  How do you know Bush is lying?
[01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:00.403]  His lips are moving.
[01:12:02.544 --> 01:12:08.086]  The fact of the matter is that this is really a weird thing.
[01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:11.387]  Have you ever heard of Philip Agee, the CIA guy?
[01:12:11.587 --> 01:12:12.728]  Yes.
[01:12:12.788 --> 01:12:17.690]  He was my neighbor in Tampa when I was growing up.
[01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:19.851]  I met him again in Venezuela.
[01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:41.127]  And if you go to my website, reopen911.org, or the Spanish one if you want that one, you click on the little Spanish flag at the top, I have two articles by him that details the CIA and how they have been undermining President Chavez and other Latin American countries ever since 1950.
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.721]  So it's a very good article, very detailed.
[01:12:44.741 --> 01:12:46.663]  Yeah, that all started off with United Fruit.
[01:12:47.723 --> 01:12:48.103]  Correct.
[01:12:48.144 --> 01:12:50.545]  It started off with United Fruit.
[01:12:50.845 --> 01:12:53.087]  The dictator went in.
[01:12:53.207 --> 01:12:53.967]  Guatemala.
[01:12:54.307 --> 01:12:54.948]  Guatemala.
[01:12:55.208 --> 01:13:01.632]  They had a properly elected Democratic leftist come in, and the CIA overthrew them in about two months.
[01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:03.750]  But they've been doing it all along.
[01:13:04.491 --> 01:13:08.272]  They were behind the 2002 coup against Chavez.
[01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:10.832]  They were behind the 2004 strike.
[01:13:10.872 --> 01:13:16.474]  Well, shifting gears, Kermit Roosevelt, before he died, admitted, and about 14 books have been written on it, the U.S.
[01:13:16.514 --> 01:13:21.435]  government in 1953 carried out terror attacks on Iran and blamed it on the government.
[01:13:21.975 --> 01:13:29.637]  They did it in Italy in 1946 to undermine the communists who they thought would come into power.
[01:13:30.675 --> 01:13:35.476]  So the CIA is... We are the evil empire.
[01:13:35.896 --> 01:13:38.736]  It's really amazing how they use this double thing.
[01:13:39.577 --> 01:13:40.737]  But back to Japan.
[01:13:40.757 --> 01:13:41.437]  I went to Japan.
[01:13:41.477 --> 01:13:42.637]  We met the Diet members.
[01:13:45.078 --> 01:13:58.600]  I talked to the Foreign Correspondents Club, and they had a bunch of correspondents there from all around the world, and no one could come up with anything to refute our evidence that the buildings were controlled demolition,
[01:13:59.373 --> 01:14:08.721]  But I started to say earlier, I don't know if you're aware of this, you cover a lot of stuff, so you probably are, but there are two more carriers on the way to the Persian Gulf.
[01:14:08.801 --> 01:14:12.183]  So there will be a total of three carrier groups in the Persian Gulf.
[01:14:12.304 --> 01:14:18.789]  Yeah, Ray McGovern and many other experts are now saying that they believe in the next four to five months they're probably going to attack Iran.
[01:14:18.809 --> 01:14:22.792]  Well, Bush said last week,
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:31.103]  He gave Iran only a few weeks to accept it, and then today I'm reading the headlines on the Internet, and it says Bush gives Iran ultimatum.
[01:14:31.883 --> 01:14:33.904]  So it may not be that long.
[01:14:34.784 --> 01:14:43.347]  But there's no reason to have three carrier groups in the Persian Gulf unless you're planning an attack, which is going to be devastating for the world.
[01:14:43.367 --> 01:14:46.348]  But anyway, so I talked to the Diet.
[01:14:46.388 --> 01:14:48.529]  I talked to a few other groups there.
[01:14:49.421 --> 01:15:03.325]  And again, the people there are absolutely amazed because their media is not allowed to... In fact, we talked to several reporters who said, our bosses said, you may not cover this story.
[01:15:03.585 --> 01:15:06.486]  How many of the Japanese Parliament did you speak to?
[01:15:06.526 --> 01:15:07.066]  How many members?
[01:15:07.587 --> 01:15:10.247]  Well, we spoke to four members directly.
[01:15:11.068 --> 01:15:11.168]  And...
[01:15:13.459 --> 01:15:16.921]  But they had over 100 staff from the other members there watching.
[01:15:17.402 --> 01:15:21.904]  And as you know, the staff often is the people who actually do the work anyway.
[01:15:22.024 --> 01:15:24.566]  What did they think about your presentation?
[01:15:25.326 --> 01:15:26.947]  Well, I had applause.
[01:15:27.508 --> 01:15:28.328]  I had astounded.
[01:15:28.388 --> 01:15:29.629]  They all got a DVD.
[01:15:30.330 --> 01:15:32.011]  And they really liked it.
[01:15:32.131 --> 01:15:32.891]  They really liked it.
[01:15:33.411 --> 01:15:37.014]  Now, have you also covered the fact of the demonization of Islam?
[01:15:38.591 --> 01:15:46.356]  Yeah, well, that was a big neocon group, and of course the main neocon that did that was caught.
[01:15:49.853 --> 01:16:02.240]  Many years ago, in the mid-90s, running fake CIA newspapers in England, and it's connected back to a Bilderberg Group member that actually owns the papers, and they just published them and put them out as propaganda.
[01:16:02.521 --> 01:16:13.207]  Then there's clear evidence that they provocateur-ed the start of the riots, and then had the police fall back and basically engineered those to get European support for the attack on Iran.
[01:16:14.091 --> 01:16:15.394]  I think you're entirely right there.
[01:16:15.814 --> 01:16:28.455]  The seven newspapers who published the cartoons on the same day they said for freedom of speech did not say a word when a guy was sent to three years in jail for questioning the details of the Holocaust.
[01:16:28.962 --> 01:16:46.796]  Now, the Holocaust is a real event, but it belies their claim that they're defending free speech when they let a guy go to jail for three years for questioning the details of the Holocaust without saying a word, but they say, oh, we had to publish all of the Mohammed cartoons on the same day.
[01:16:47.257 --> 01:16:56.544]  And it turns out that three of the five cartoons, the original ones, were fakes taken from photos made black and white and published, so they weren't even real cartoons.
[01:16:56.584 --> 01:16:58.466]  The controversy was manufactured.
[01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:00.247]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:17:00.787 --> 01:17:10.673]  And it is a conspiracy to make the rest of the world feel that all of Islam is radical.
[01:17:10.853 --> 01:17:16.017]  And I don't believe even that the groups that are doing the suicide bombings are truly Islamic.
[01:17:16.317 --> 01:17:21.620]  Because under Islamic law, it is prohibited in war to kill women and children.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:26.183]  So the fact is that the Iranians...
[01:17:26.721 --> 01:17:35.249]  If they are truly an Islamic, and I think they are, but some of these imams, who claim to be imams, I think they're being funded by the CIA to stir up trouble.
[01:17:35.269 --> 01:17:36.511]  Well, there's no thinking about it.
[01:17:36.671 --> 01:17:45.900]  At the end of World War II, for a 30-year program, culminating in 1987 when the Russians pulled out, our government's policy was to radicalize them.
[01:17:47.201 --> 01:17:47.421]  Well...
[01:17:49.508 --> 01:17:53.950]  It was... I have to blame those guys partly because they rallied the people out there.
[01:17:53.970 --> 01:18:01.473]  But, you know, they were paying... The CIA was paying people a hundred bucks each to go to that protest in the Ukraine.
[01:18:01.993 --> 01:18:05.695]  So we don't know who or what is actually going on here.
[01:18:07.055 --> 01:18:08.216]  But in Japan...
[01:18:09.694 --> 01:18:14.875]  I don't know if you noticed it, but the news is out today that they're pulling out their 600 troops.
[01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:18.016]  So Japan will no longer have any troops in Iraq.
[01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:19.296]  Yeah, that came out yesterday.
[01:18:19.336 --> 01:18:20.137]  That's some good news.
[01:18:20.477 --> 01:18:21.837]  It is good news.
[01:18:23.137 --> 01:18:25.218]  I don't know if we can do it, but I hope so.
[01:18:25.658 --> 01:18:30.419]  The people we talked to in the Japanese Parliament were really concerned about this.
[01:18:30.759 --> 01:18:34.240]  They had no idea any of this was happening.
[01:18:34.864 --> 01:18:39.448]  And our DVD is in Japanese and Chinese as well as eight other languages.
[01:18:39.468 --> 01:18:42.970]  So we're still giving those away.
[01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.892]  You're giving them a run for their money.
[01:18:44.912 --> 01:18:46.333]  You're hurting them bad, Jimmy Walter.
[01:18:46.793 --> 01:18:47.233]  Stay there.
[01:18:47.293 --> 01:18:50.756]  Let's come back and talk about more of your strategies to defeat the New World Order.
[01:18:53.883 --> 01:18:56.724]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me.
[01:18:56.984 --> 01:18:59.144]  Especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[01:18:59.404 --> 01:19:02.004]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[01:19:02.444 --> 01:19:05.005]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[01:19:05.365 --> 01:19:10.326]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[01:19:10.586 --> 01:19:14.086]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[01:19:14.406 --> 01:19:15.987]  Now they look and feel great.
[01:19:16.327 --> 01:19:19.807]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:23.028]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[01:19:24.488 --> 01:19:26.969]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.349]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:33.231]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:19:33.871 --> 01:19:40.333]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:19:41.133 --> 01:19:43.334]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:19:43.714 --> 01:19:43.934]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:43.954 --> 01:19:44.434]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:59.217 --> 01:20:02.479]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:03.219 --> 01:20:07.202]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:13.467 --> 01:20:16.589]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:20:16.849 --> 01:20:18.690]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:21.771]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:20:22.312 --> 01:20:24.533]  Here is reality.
[01:20:24.913 --> 01:20:28.475]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:20:28.975 --> 01:20:32.637]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:20:33.197 --> 01:20:35.698]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:37.635]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:54.741 --> 01:20:58.605]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:58.645 --> 01:20:59.246]  We listened.
[01:21:15.402 --> 01:21:19.485]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:21:19.865 --> 01:21:20.346]  We listened.
[01:21:20.686 --> 01:21:25.930]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:27.711]  Again, we listened.
[01:21:28.071 --> 01:21:35.457]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:21:35.837 --> 01:21:39.300]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:55.935]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:56.436 --> 01:21:59.278]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[01:22:00.219 --> 01:22:09.826]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:10.786 --> 01:22:14.569]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:22:14.549 --> 01:22:16.030]  's patented methodology.
[01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:27.579]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[01:22:28.199 --> 01:22:30.721]  Star War technology at its best.
[01:22:31.602 --> 01:22:33.043]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[01:22:37.182 --> 01:22:40.883]  One of the prime movers in the fight against
[01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:14.861]  The criminals that carried out 9-11, their foundational event to bring in a worldwide police state controlled by the Anglo-American power system, power axis.
[01:23:15.902 --> 01:23:23.127]  Jimmy, I think we've got them on the run, but they could pull their ace card and carry out more false flag, government-sponsored terror attacks.
[01:23:24.503 --> 01:23:34.005]  I don't think that even with their war games and their focus groups and their internal testing they did, that they thought this many people would wake up to 9-11, this many people would be speaking out.
[01:23:34.045 --> 01:23:41.727]  I mean, Zogby polls now with half of the American people believing the government was involved, 68% believing that they're covering up.
[01:23:42.187 --> 01:23:48.609]  I mean, if we've got half the public today, and I agree with those numbers from people I've talked to on the street, then the establishment's in deep trouble, Jimmy.
[01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:49.669]  Where do you see them going from here?
[01:23:50.576 --> 01:23:57.098]  Well, I've seen them setting off a nuclear weapon in a container vessel off the coast of the United States.
[01:23:57.838 --> 01:24:09.040]  I see them saying, oh, well, we stopped it from getting on board, but the minute they set off a nuclear weapon, and they're going to blame it on the Arabs, then everybody will say, oh, well, now we have to attack.
[01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:16.002]  I don't know if you've been following reports, but a CBS News poll between June 10th and 11th
[01:24:17.213 --> 01:24:25.708]  Only 21% of the people think military action now, 55% think diplomacy now, and 19% think not a threat.
[01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:27.732]  So these figures are huge.
[01:24:28.754 --> 01:24:46.239]  If Bush does not have the public support for an attack, and the only way he's going to get that public support, and I think they've been focusing on Rand's non-existent nuclear weapons like they've focused on Iraq's, is to set off a nuclear weapon and false flag diplomacy.
[01:24:46.259 --> 01:24:50.200]  And I know you know they had those terror drills involving just such a scam.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:56.165]  By the way, I haven't brought this up yet on air, but one of my employee's parents called him from the road.
[01:24:56.645 --> 01:25:01.289]  They were stuck on the highway, I-10, outside Houston for seven hours.
[01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:02.070]  There were U.S.
[01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:03.331]  Army troops out there.
[01:25:03.751 --> 01:25:05.152]  They had the whole road shut down.
[01:25:05.192 --> 01:25:13.799]  They said it was a bomb scare, and we've been trying to get info on that, but his parents confirmed that it happened to them, and they love to use these drills as cover.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.963]  There's been a drill every time there's been a terrorist attack.
[01:25:18.693 --> 01:25:21.034]  And just a coincidence, of course.
[01:25:21.194 --> 01:25:22.974]  We're conspiracy nuts.
[01:25:23.034 --> 01:25:24.135]  They're coincidence nuts.
[01:25:24.555 --> 01:25:26.776]  Well, their entire program is stalling.
[01:25:26.816 --> 01:25:28.196]  Their support is evaporating.
[01:25:28.236 --> 01:25:29.517]  No one trusts them anymore.
[01:25:30.737 --> 01:25:38.660]  Unfortunately, they're going to be able to attack Iran without some type of terror attack taking place in Western Europe or the U.S.
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:42.781]  I don't see them being able to carry out the attack.
[01:25:43.627 --> 01:25:48.312]  Well, my friends in Europe think it's going to be Berlin for the World Cup Finals.
[01:25:49.613 --> 01:26:01.385]  I say, well, Americans are too insular, but if they set off a nuclear weapon anywhere in the world, that'll be all the excuse Bush needs to, one, declare martial law, two, attack Iran.
[01:26:02.766 --> 01:26:06.310]  Well, even Sandra Day O'Connor, retired Supreme Court, even...
[01:26:07.088 --> 01:26:08.589]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:26:08.609 --> 01:26:09.810]  And the other thing is, the Federal Reserve...
[01:26:26.365 --> 01:26:30.969]  By continuing to raise interest rates and crunch the economy is trying to get rid of Bush.
[01:26:31.029 --> 01:26:33.911]  They are not happy with this deficit.
[01:26:34.591 --> 01:26:38.194]  Well, Bernanke's going crazy, though, saying he's going to print money like it's going out of style.
[01:26:38.715 --> 01:26:41.056]  Well, he is printing money like it's going out of style.
[01:26:41.357 --> 01:26:46.761]  Just look at the currency that's in circulation and how much he's adding in repos all the time.
[01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:56.168]  When I was in Japan, one of the guys, I said that this was a war for oil and profit and terrorism.
[01:26:57.316 --> 01:26:59.857]  And this guy says, well, U.S.
[01:26:59.917 --> 01:27:02.219]  does not own the oil in Iraq.
[01:27:02.319 --> 01:27:03.399]  Iraq owns the oil.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.181]  And I said, well, they may own the oil, but we control it.
[01:27:07.542 --> 01:27:10.923]  And he says, well, the United States will still have to pay for it.
[01:27:11.004 --> 01:27:12.264]  But they don't own the oil.
[01:27:12.344 --> 01:27:13.965]  We have their own Energy Task Force documents.
[01:27:14.005 --> 01:27:15.406]  It was given directly to the oil companies.
[01:27:16.042 --> 01:27:22.366]  Well, the oil companies have gone in there and taken over all the contracts, but technically they have to pay Iraq some money.
[01:27:22.426 --> 01:27:23.946]  But I said, that doesn't matter to Bush.
[01:27:23.986 --> 01:27:25.627]  He's spending money like a drunken sailor anyway.
[01:27:25.647 --> 01:27:27.368]  They just want to shut off the oil.
[01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:28.629]  That then jacks up prices.
[01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:39.735]  Well, I'm sure you know that after the first Iraq war, Saudi Arabia, Bush's friends, doubled their output from 3 million barrels to 6 million barrels.
[01:27:40.106 --> 01:27:58.576]  Well, there's no doubt about that, and there's no doubt that they're not going to turn that spigot back on, because the military is saving that as their strategic reserve.
[01:27:58.636 --> 01:28:00.857]  The military runs on oil.
[01:28:01.678 --> 01:28:05.800]  We can make wind power for other things, but you can't run a tank on wind power.
[01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:07.890]  Or an F-16.
[01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:10.032]  Or an F-16.
[01:28:11.153 --> 01:28:29.928]  And then the other thing is, back on Venezuela a little bit, if you read the headlines, I get Yahoo, my Yahoo is my home page because I get all the news sources there, but all the time they're spinning Chavez, oh, South Americans worried about Chavez, South Americans worried about Chavez's new gun factory.
[01:28:30.453 --> 01:28:34.154]  I'm telling you, Chavez is loved in his country beyond anybody.
[01:28:34.174 --> 01:28:34.754]  Well, stay there.
[01:28:34.894 --> 01:28:35.894]  One final segment, Jimmy.
[01:28:35.914 --> 01:28:36.815]  We've got a break.
[01:28:36.835 --> 01:28:38.395]  Just keep you five minutes on the other side.
[01:28:38.415 --> 01:28:40.135]  And we've got David Stahl joining us.
[01:28:40.155 --> 01:28:40.555]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.256 --> 01:28:45.137]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.637 --> 01:28:47.237]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:50.838]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.332 --> 01:28:56.892]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[01:28:57.233 --> 01:28:58.773]  A tornado under your hood!
[01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:04.714]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[01:29:05.014 --> 01:29:12.095]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with tornado.
[01:29:12.235 --> 01:29:17.016]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[01:29:17.196 --> 01:29:22.737]  Visit tornadoair.com or pick up your tornado at Checker, Shucks, and Cragen today.
[01:29:24.708 --> 01:29:28.449]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:33.491]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[01:29:33.791 --> 01:29:35.252]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[01:29:35.532 --> 01:29:35.752]  No.
[01:29:36.072 --> 01:29:39.853]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[01:29:40.233 --> 01:29:41.594]  Are all covers the same?
[01:29:41.854 --> 01:29:42.074]  No.
[01:29:42.354 --> 01:29:46.035]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:29:46.436 --> 01:29:48.556]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[01:29:48.836 --> 01:29:51.357]  Kimberly Clark's Block It fabric's got you covered.
[01:29:51.637 --> 01:29:53.418]  That's Block It by Kimberly Clark.
[01:29:55.581 --> 01:30:06.859]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:30:07.079 --> 01:30:10.565]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:30:10.825 --> 01:30:11.245]  We're good to go.
[01:30:31.957 --> 01:30:38.885]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:30:39.105 --> 01:30:43.049]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:45.773]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:45.793 --> 01:30:46.974]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:57.512]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:57.712 --> 01:31:01.113]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:01.293 --> 01:31:04.695]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.282]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:08.302 --> 01:31:13.764]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:13.804 --> 01:31:23.429]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:23.569 --> 01:31:24.909]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:31:24.949 --> 01:31:30.352]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:35.273]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:35.293 --> 01:31:36.734]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:36.894 --> 01:31:40.775]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:40.815 --> 01:31:41.635]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:00.841]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.321 --> 01:32:04.122]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.262 --> 01:32:15.786]  Well, even the Associated Press says the CFR runs this country and writes up the policy to get rid of America's sovereignty, and it happens.
[01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:19.587]  David Stahl of CorridorWatch.org from here in Texas joins us.
[01:32:19.607 --> 01:32:22.908]  We have another expert coming on in the third hour on the subject.
[01:32:23.808 --> 01:32:25.929]  He's on the four-year request to get all the documents.
[01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:27.671]  Going back to Jimmy Walter.
[01:32:27.691 --> 01:32:28.993]  Jimmy, I'm not going to take much more of your time.
[01:32:29.033 --> 01:32:29.834]  I'm meeting with you on Friday.
[01:32:29.854 --> 01:32:30.475]  Look forward to that.
[01:32:31.516 --> 01:32:38.484]  But just finish up with what you were saying about what's happening in Venezuela and then any other key points you'd like to add.
[01:32:39.705 --> 01:32:43.630]  Hugo Chavez is deeply loved by the people of Venezuela.
[01:32:43.890 --> 01:32:46.353]  The CIA has been down there stirring up trouble.
[01:32:47.289 --> 01:32:55.231]  The news services are always spinning him as being some sort of threat, and other countries warning him, when in fact it's quite the opposite.
[01:32:55.271 --> 01:33:03.792]  Hugo Chavez has saved many of those countries from the IMF, and we all know what that stands for, and their predatory policies.
[01:33:04.933 --> 01:33:10.073]  So please do not believe that Chavez is any sort of a dictator.
[01:33:10.094 --> 01:33:12.554]  There was plenty of debate
[01:33:13.098 --> 01:33:14.818]  About him in the newspapers.
[01:33:14.858 --> 01:33:16.599]  He does not control all the newspapers.
[01:33:16.899 --> 01:33:22.380]  He hasn't even shut down two of the CIA's subterfuge organizations, NGOs down there.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.821]  So he is not a threat at all.
[01:33:24.461 --> 01:33:26.301]  Alex, thank you for having me on the show.
[01:33:26.361 --> 01:33:31.723]  I look forward to seeing you Friday and being on your program this weekend, June 24th and 5th in L.A.
[01:33:31.783 --> 01:33:32.943]  at the Sheraton downtown.
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:34.721]  You bet, my friend.
[01:33:34.941 --> 01:33:36.523]  And we're going to have dinner on Friday.
[01:33:36.543 --> 01:33:39.245]  I know you've got to leave us.
[01:33:39.365 --> 01:33:42.928]  Just give us a little overview of what your speech is going to be on.
[01:33:43.569 --> 01:33:48.673]  Well, pretty much what we already talked about today, only I have more pictures and details.
[01:33:49.274 --> 01:33:50.595]  I want to recommend one thing.
[01:33:50.655 --> 01:33:57.241]  If you all haven't seen Eyewitness 911, 911 Eyewitness, it's very good in the details.
[01:33:57.734 --> 01:34:02.938]  They're going to be there, the folks that videotaped it, with their new version.
[01:34:03.079 --> 01:34:05.340]  It's going to be premiering, Jimmy, on Sunday.
[01:34:12.676 --> 01:34:13.977]  I'm watching it right now.
[01:34:14.097 --> 01:34:17.078]  I met them in Japan and got a copy already.
[01:34:17.198 --> 01:34:18.618]  So it's a great video.
[01:34:18.879 --> 01:34:20.259]  Oh, of their new edition?
[01:34:20.499 --> 01:34:21.019]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:21.039 --> 01:34:22.740]  911 Eyewitness Hoboken.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:23.420]  All right.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.301]  That is incredible.
[01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:25.361]  Jimmy, we'll see you soon.
[01:34:25.801 --> 01:34:26.461]  Take care, Alex.
[01:34:26.782 --> 01:34:27.262]  All the best.
[01:34:27.422 --> 01:34:27.702]  You bet.
[01:34:27.722 --> 01:34:28.082]  Bye-bye.
[01:34:28.542 --> 01:34:36.385]  I'm going to jam a few calls in for those that have been patient, and then we're going to get David Stahl on in about nine minutes, 15 seconds if you want to get precise.
[01:34:37.246 --> 01:34:38.346]  Let's go ahead.
[01:34:38.926 --> 01:34:40.767]  Of all these calls, who should I go to first?
[01:34:42.353 --> 01:34:43.834]  Stephen New York, you're on the air.
[01:34:43.854 --> 01:34:44.414]  Thanks for holding.
[01:34:45.174 --> 01:34:45.994]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:34:46.335 --> 01:34:46.595]  Good.
[01:34:47.175 --> 01:34:50.856]  Pretty interesting what you got there about the SPP and your website there.
[01:34:52.477 --> 01:34:57.579]  It's outrageous what's going on with all that stuff, and people don't understand it.
[01:34:57.979 --> 01:35:00.119]  Yeah, you tell people, hey, we're going into an American Union.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:00.880]  Here's the documents.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:01.180]  Huh?
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:01.840]  What's that?
[01:35:04.261 --> 01:35:06.162]  People don't want to believe it when you give them the truth.
[01:35:07.574 --> 01:35:08.154]  You're blinded.
[01:35:08.414 --> 01:35:09.555]  Well, that's changing, though.
[01:35:09.575 --> 01:35:10.935]  I mean, it's hard to believe.
[01:35:11.296 --> 01:35:12.636]  Oh, no, it's not hard to believe.
[01:35:12.956 --> 01:35:14.177]  Listen to what you say there.
[01:35:14.557 --> 01:35:16.578]  It sounds encouraging to me.
[01:35:17.438 --> 01:35:21.740]  I just hope more people prepare for what might come down the road soon.
[01:35:22.219 --> 01:35:27.503]  I mean, I want all the government employees, everybody to know, we're not saying you're all crooks, but the system is criminal.
[01:35:27.843 --> 01:35:29.165]  The system is un-American.
[01:35:29.205 --> 01:35:30.746]  The system is unconstitutional.
[01:35:31.066 --> 01:35:32.427]  The system is predatory.
[01:35:32.867 --> 01:35:35.449]  The system is going to hurt you just as bad as it's going to hurt us.
[01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:37.591]  You need to decide who you're with.
[01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:41.794]  This is the time to decide which side you are on.
[01:35:42.475 --> 01:35:42.855]  Go ahead.
[01:35:43.316 --> 01:35:43.676]  Okay.
[01:35:43.856 --> 01:35:47.279]  Well, there's lots of information out there that people should...
[01:35:48.123 --> 01:35:53.028]  Check out if they want to understand, like, what you were saying about the Council on Foreign Relations controlling us.
[01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:55.651]  That's the real government.
[01:35:55.711 --> 01:35:56.672]  We didn't elect them.
[01:35:57.273 --> 01:36:04.561]  Well, it would be like on the Shadows of Power that you can get from John Birch's American Opinion book site there.
[01:36:04.581 --> 01:36:08.305]  Plus, they've got, like, Tragedy and Hope.
[01:36:08.625 --> 01:36:09.927]  Tragedy and Hope tells you about...
[01:36:10.922 --> 01:36:13.204]  What Carol Quigley said about controlling the world.
[01:36:13.504 --> 01:36:14.524]  Yeah, he wrote it.
[01:36:14.564 --> 01:36:18.207]  It's a 918-page book saying we are the new world order.
[01:36:18.567 --> 01:36:19.808]  We're going to take all your freedoms.
[01:36:19.848 --> 01:36:20.989]  Head political scientist.
[01:36:21.529 --> 01:36:22.790]  Bill Clinton's main mentor.
[01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:23.370]  Yep.
[01:36:23.651 --> 01:36:24.551]  It was his mentor.
[01:36:25.552 --> 01:36:27.293]  So he thanked in his first State of the Union.
[01:36:27.313 --> 01:36:28.013]  Thanks for the call.
[01:36:28.954 --> 01:36:31.015]  Let's go to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:36:31.236 --> 01:36:32.236]  Charles, you're on the air.
[01:36:32.897 --> 01:36:33.517]  Mr. Jones.
[01:36:33.617 --> 01:36:34.017]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:34.218 --> 01:36:40.482]  You already mentioned it, but they're sending the National Guard down to New Orleans again with 40 state troopers.
[01:36:41.278 --> 01:36:44.199]  And I've been listening to their program down in New Orleans.
[01:36:44.559 --> 01:36:48.801]  They said if a tragedy happens again, they will confiscate guns.
[01:36:49.342 --> 01:36:49.642]  I know.
[01:36:50.522 --> 01:36:55.124]  And so I tried to call in, but I couldn't get in.
[01:36:55.164 --> 01:36:58.025]  So the guy said, what if a guy's trying to defend his property?
[01:36:58.425 --> 01:37:06.349]  He said, if the gun's not concealed, the officer will walk up to him, and if he don't give no resistance, he will get the gun back later on.
[01:37:08.158 --> 01:37:11.160]  Which federal courts have already said is illegal.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.601]  There's an injunction against it.
[01:37:13.101 --> 01:37:17.004]  So when it's in the national news, they deny it's going on, and locally they're doing it.
[01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:17.884]  Yes, I have the article.
[01:37:17.904 --> 01:37:18.465]  Tell us about it.
[01:37:18.865 --> 01:37:20.866]  So I was going to call in and say that.
[01:37:21.326 --> 01:37:28.651]  Even though the federal judge said no confiscation, they're already getting ready to confiscate.
[01:37:29.567 --> 01:37:30.808]  And DeBlanco loves it.
[01:37:30.888 --> 01:37:32.708]  She really feels powerful doing it.
[01:37:32.728 --> 01:37:39.570]  Yeah, the governor and then Nagin are on record saying that the city is basically under martial law.
[01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:39.910]  That's right.
[01:37:40.170 --> 01:37:42.471]  Even the police are wearing camo with the troops.
[01:37:42.551 --> 01:37:45.632]  It's a giant laboratory, a battlefield laboratory.
[01:37:45.672 --> 01:37:46.592]  The Pentagon admits it.
[01:37:46.833 --> 01:37:47.313]  Well, yes.
[01:37:47.753 --> 01:37:51.014]  A state trooper stopped me about 11.30 three days ago.
[01:37:51.314 --> 01:37:52.274]  I was driving slow.
[01:37:52.294 --> 01:37:52.774]  He stopped me.
[01:37:52.794 --> 01:37:53.695]  We were driving slow.
[01:37:54.075 --> 01:37:57.096]  So I pulled into a lighted area, and he said, Come here.
[01:37:57.176 --> 01:37:57.656]  And he said,
[01:37:58.106 --> 01:37:59.086]  And I said, I did something wrong.
[01:37:59.126 --> 01:38:00.547]  He said, yeah, you were driving slow.
[01:38:00.567 --> 01:38:01.768]  I said, it's 1130 at night.
[01:38:01.808 --> 01:38:05.269]  There ain't no cars in the highway, officer.
[01:38:05.689 --> 01:38:07.710]  He said, well, I'm looking for drunken drivers.
[01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:08.831]  So I started talking to him.
[01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:12.452]  I said, by the way, I said, are you from around here?
[01:38:12.472 --> 01:38:15.133]  He says, well, I travel around here a lot.
[01:38:15.674 --> 01:38:16.534]  I'm from Baton Rouge.
[01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:18.355]  I said, well, they disarmed you.
[01:38:18.415 --> 01:38:19.235]  I said, what are you going to do?
[01:38:19.275 --> 01:38:20.636]  He said, yeah, I heard about that.
[01:38:20.716 --> 01:38:22.156]  They might disarm us.
[01:38:22.176 --> 01:38:24.037]  I said, they've got United Nations troops here, 325,000.
[01:38:26.314 --> 01:38:29.075]  And after you get through arresting us, they're probably going to take away your guns.
[01:38:29.135 --> 01:38:30.135]  What do you feel about that?
[01:38:30.155 --> 01:38:31.855]  I said, I'm not trying to be smart.
[01:38:32.316 --> 01:38:33.496]  He said, it's crazy, isn't it?
[01:38:34.076 --> 01:38:38.877]  I said, what's crazy is, I said, the people don't want to stand up for their rights no more.
[01:38:39.217 --> 01:38:40.878]  My rights are gone and yours is too.
[01:38:41.318 --> 01:38:45.259]  I said, y'all can come into any house now and just come in.
[01:38:45.279 --> 01:38:48.400]  He said, yeah, if we feel they got guns in there or something, we can go in and check it out.
[01:38:49.366 --> 01:38:51.010]  So, the people lost.
[01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.474]  They already lost their rights.
[01:38:53.115 --> 01:38:56.885]  If he feels they got guns and they're illegal guns, he could just come into your house.
[01:38:57.583 --> 01:38:58.324]  Don't need a search warrant.
[01:38:58.344 --> 01:39:01.346]  Well, that started four years ago in Louisiana.
[01:39:01.386 --> 01:39:02.606]  Remember the note?
[01:39:02.806 --> 01:39:03.747]  I'm calling on it.
[01:39:03.787 --> 01:39:04.147]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:04.187 --> 01:39:05.668]  Not just no-knock search warrants.
[01:39:05.708 --> 01:39:06.649]  It was in the news.
[01:39:06.989 --> 01:39:11.652]  A local federal judge ruled that without warrants, they can randomly search houses.
[01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:11.952]  Yes.
[01:39:12.273 --> 01:39:13.594]  If they're knocking your doors, come in.
[01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.035]  They can just invite themselves in.
[01:39:15.315 --> 01:39:16.936]  I went to the sheriff's department down there.
[01:39:16.976 --> 01:39:18.317]  I talked to the police about it.
[01:39:18.337 --> 01:39:19.778]  They haven't get it down here yet.
[01:39:20.478 --> 01:39:20.938]  You understand?
[01:39:21.179 --> 01:39:22.880]  I'm trying to pass these tapes out quick.
[01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:25.141]  I'm doubling my time right now.
[01:39:25.161 --> 01:39:25.401]  Good job.
[01:39:25.421 --> 01:39:26.282]  I'm just doubling my time.
[01:39:26.874 --> 01:39:28.215]  We've got to redouble our efforts.
[01:39:28.675 --> 01:39:29.676]  Well, that's right.
[01:39:29.796 --> 01:39:37.240]  Everybody listening to this program, Mr. Jones, if they would wake up one other person, just one other person, we could double our strength.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.841]  They're going to have to get on the ball again.
[01:39:38.861 --> 01:39:44.204]  Listen, they're not going to be able to get away with it if we expose the American Union, if we expose the plan for gun confiscation.
[01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:46.605]  If we expose what's happening, they will fail.
[01:39:47.266 --> 01:39:52.449]  America literally has its head in the guillotine, its neck on the chopping block right now.
[01:39:52.509 --> 01:39:54.170]  We all have to exert ourselves 110%.
[01:39:56.351 --> 01:39:57.792]  You need to plug your tapes in more.
[01:39:57.872 --> 01:39:58.412]  Help me out.
[01:39:58.632 --> 01:39:59.232]  Get these people.
[01:39:59.432 --> 01:40:01.513]  We might get somebody else to start putting out hundreds of tapes.
[01:40:01.873 --> 01:40:03.034]  Keep plugging them tapes, Ms.
[01:40:03.074 --> 01:40:03.354]  Jones.
[01:40:03.394 --> 01:40:03.954]  Keep on them.
[01:40:04.214 --> 01:40:05.975]  Because I know you get excited.
[01:40:06.055 --> 01:40:07.035]  You know, you get so much.
[01:40:07.315 --> 01:40:08.816]  But I need help here.
[01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.637]  I need other people in Louisiana to help me make these tapes.
[01:40:11.957 --> 01:40:15.098]  I had a policeman's wife help me, but she's had a baby now.
[01:40:15.118 --> 01:40:15.819]  She can't do it.
[01:40:16.179 --> 01:40:18.660]  So I'm by myself passing them out again.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.821]  But keep plugging them tapes.
[01:40:22.061 --> 01:40:23.702]  That's the only way I know how to do this.
[01:40:24.696 --> 01:40:26.137]  Thank you, Charles, for all you do.
[01:40:26.377 --> 01:40:27.538]  How many tapes have you passed out?
[01:40:27.578 --> 01:40:27.698]  Over 6,000?
[01:40:27.758 --> 01:40:30.479]  Well, it's about 6,800, 6,900 now.
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:32.340]  I lost count, to be honest.
[01:40:32.621 --> 01:40:35.342]  I haven't been counting because I've been trying to... People's calling me.
[01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.403]  They're asking for them now.
[01:40:36.483 --> 01:40:38.284]  I run out the house.
[01:40:38.324 --> 01:40:39.024]  I don't write it down.
[01:40:39.084 --> 01:40:39.705]  I used to write it down.
[01:40:39.765 --> 01:40:40.545]  I made a date.
[01:40:40.865 --> 01:40:42.506]  It's about 6,800 now.
[01:40:42.926 --> 01:40:43.927]  But I'm hoping to God...
[01:40:44.321 --> 01:40:46.443]  I'm hoping to God that other people start doing this too.
[01:40:46.503 --> 01:40:47.123]  It's not hard.
[01:40:47.363 --> 01:40:50.285]  They can make two or three tapes a day, or just one a day.
[01:40:50.445 --> 01:40:51.146]  Just one tape.
[01:40:51.366 --> 01:40:55.269]  Get a tape from you and make one tape a day, and that's 30 tapes a month.
[01:40:55.309 --> 01:40:56.169]  It doesn't take long.
[01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:59.732]  Or two tapes a month, that's 60 tapes.
[01:40:59.792 --> 01:41:03.074]  I'll put out about 120 a month.
[01:41:03.334 --> 01:41:03.854]  Good job.
[01:41:03.894 --> 01:41:04.575]  Good to hear from you.
[01:41:06.034 --> 01:41:08.715]  Because Charles brought it up, I will plug the videos at this time.
[01:41:09.155 --> 01:41:11.176]  I think the best film we've made is Marshall Law.
[01:41:11.196 --> 01:41:13.377]  It covers 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:41:13.397 --> 01:41:15.078]  It tells you how they did it and why they did it.
[01:41:15.098 --> 01:41:19.600]  It covers the latest police state developments, and then it gets into the New World Order's master plan.
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:22.521]  It is such an important documentary.
[01:41:22.561 --> 01:41:26.903]  Three hours and 45 seconds long for $24.95.
[01:41:27.423 --> 01:41:30.184]  The price of one DVD, you really get three films in one.
[01:41:31.124 --> 01:41:33.205]  Here's my newest film, The Order of Death, about $46.
[01:41:36.552 --> 01:41:37.256]  Minutes long.
[01:41:38.646 --> 01:41:48.168]  New footage inside Bohemian Grove, the bizarre rituals they engage in, and then we took the original Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove, updated it, added new documents, shortened it down to an hour and a half.
[01:41:48.188 --> 01:41:51.089]  So you get an hour and a half film and a 46-minute film, roughly.
[01:41:51.349 --> 01:41:52.889]  Two films on one DVD.
[01:41:52.949 --> 01:42:01.671]  Get The Order of Death, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, combo DVD for $24.95 and get it as low as, I think it's like $10 if you get a bunch of copies apiece.
[01:42:02.111 --> 01:42:03.251]  And that's also how you support us.
[01:42:03.271 --> 01:42:04.371]  You know, I don't ask for donations.
[01:42:04.391 --> 01:42:06.992]  I don't ask for that type of support like other people do.
[01:42:07.552 --> 01:42:07.992]  We're good to go.
[01:42:18.678 --> 01:42:20.279]  And then you get these materials in your hands.
[01:42:20.299 --> 01:42:24.180]  You're authorized to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes of my films.
[01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:27.521]  Then there's my book, Paul Watson's book, all the other books and videos I carry.
[01:42:27.961 --> 01:42:32.883]  So when you get those, you support us, you support the people that made them, and you then get a material to get out to people.
[01:42:32.923 --> 01:42:36.664]  So go to InfoWars.com to order via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[01:42:37.064 --> 01:42:38.925]  Or call toll-free to get the films right now.
[01:42:38.965 --> 01:42:41.766]  They can answer all your questions, tell you about the different specials, take your orders.
[01:42:41.786 --> 01:42:41.846]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:42:48.009 --> 01:42:48.909]  888-253-3139.
[01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:54.052]  I know a lot of you years ago got Martial Law, you got Road to Tyranny, you got Masters of Terror.
[01:42:54.313 --> 01:42:55.213]  Those were all great films.
[01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:56.634]  You've got to see the new ones.
[01:42:57.755 --> 01:42:59.156]  You've got to see these videos.
[01:42:59.196 --> 01:43:00.116]  You need to get them.
[01:43:01.297 --> 01:43:07.981]  Now, my new film, Terror Storm, will not be available on DVD for about a month.
[01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:14.846]  When we get back, we're making the cover right now, when the film's done, we are sending it off to have it mass-produced.
[01:43:15.399 --> 01:43:18.541]  You know, the official quality stamped DVDs, not the burned DVDs.
[01:43:20.062 --> 01:43:21.603]  Some promotional copies I am making.
[01:43:21.643 --> 01:43:23.145]  We are burning some here in-house.
[01:43:24.085 --> 01:43:25.927]  And I think a few of those may be available at the conference.
[01:43:25.967 --> 01:43:28.929]  But officially, the DVD will not be available for about a month.
[01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:32.591]  That's why, for PrisonPlanet.tv members, it's so important.
[01:43:32.611 --> 01:43:33.372]  You can go there.
[01:43:33.392 --> 01:43:35.693]  It'll be uploaded the next few days.
[01:43:36.554 --> 01:43:39.216]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv, $5.95 for a membership.
[01:43:39.256 --> 01:43:41.498]  You can burn all 15 of my films.
[01:43:41.538 --> 01:43:43.859]  My 15th film going up this week, Terror Storm.
[01:43:43.899 --> 01:43:44.800]  It's unbelievably good.
[01:43:46.067 --> 01:43:48.689]  I don't even want to say how much I spent making it compared to past films.
[01:43:48.749 --> 01:43:51.231]  It's pretty ridiculous as far as budgets.
[01:43:51.251 --> 01:43:52.833]  I think I counted it all up.
[01:43:53.333 --> 01:43:54.354]  I thought it would be $60,000.
[01:43:54.394 --> 01:43:56.636]  It looks like it's going to be around $80,000.
[01:43:57.256 --> 01:43:58.638]  And that's a lot of money for us folks.
[01:43:59.378 --> 01:44:01.540]  We have really depleted our coffers to do this.
[01:44:02.421 --> 01:44:03.061]  But it's worth it.
[01:44:03.081 --> 01:44:08.866]  The film's quality, its production value, shot in high def, it's just unbelievable.
[01:44:09.467 --> 01:44:13.050]  So PrisonPlanet.tv members, you're going to be able to
[01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:14.942]  We're good to go.
[01:44:37.703 --> 01:44:40.184]  And the Republic's being seized as an engine of global government.
[01:44:40.504 --> 01:44:45.026]  If we stop them from fully seizing the U.S., we can stop the entire New World Order with God's help.
[01:44:45.367 --> 01:44:47.768]  So prisonplanet.tv, get your memberships today.
[01:44:48.668 --> 01:44:52.870]  It will be available there for weeks and weeks and weeks before it's available on DVD.
[01:44:53.290 --> 01:44:56.612]  So get your membership to prisonplanet.tv now.
[01:44:56.972 --> 01:44:59.253]  N-O-W, big time.
[01:45:00.533 --> 01:45:01.574]  Do we have David Stahl?
[01:45:02.714 --> 01:45:03.935]  Okay, what number did you call?
[01:45:05.646 --> 01:45:07.427]  Okay, then Kevin didn't give you his cell.
[01:45:08.047 --> 01:45:09.488]  He's stuck on the road in traffic.
[01:45:09.888 --> 01:45:12.350]  Get the alternate number, transmit, and get him, okay?
[01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:14.471]  Well, we need to do that.
[01:45:14.531 --> 01:45:14.931]  Thank you.
[01:45:15.991 --> 01:45:18.333]  Let's go ahead and take one more call.
[01:45:18.373 --> 01:45:20.234]  Jerome Corsi is joining us in the next hour as well.
[01:45:21.834 --> 01:45:23.175]  Let's go to Dave in California.
[01:45:23.215 --> 01:45:23.995]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:45:24.015 --> 01:45:24.696]  Hi, Alex.
[01:45:24.756 --> 01:45:25.156]  Good morning.
[01:45:25.376 --> 01:45:26.177]  Hi.
[01:45:26.457 --> 01:45:28.978]  Congratulations on filling up the conference.
[01:45:29.038 --> 01:45:31.699]  I wish I could have gotten there, but I've got some health issues preventing it.
[01:45:31.759 --> 01:45:33.861]  But I will be buying all the...
[01:45:35.151 --> 01:45:37.652]  What is it, your special, the All the Tapes special?
[01:45:37.912 --> 01:45:39.212]  Yes, that really supports us.
[01:45:39.552 --> 01:45:42.453]  Yeah, and I'll be doing some burning, too, just as soon as I get them.
[01:45:42.794 --> 01:45:43.894]  I had one comment.
[01:45:44.174 --> 01:45:59.359]  I was wondering how many people associate the tune with Our Country Tis of Thee, and how many people have actually put together the fact that that tune is also God Save Our Gracious Queen.
[01:46:00.528 --> 01:46:02.610]  Just a thought about how deep the rabbit hole gets.
[01:46:02.630 --> 01:46:05.012]  God save our noble queen!
[01:46:05.032 --> 01:46:06.633]  Yeah, isn't that weird?
[01:46:07.154 --> 01:46:07.734]  It is weird.
[01:46:08.295 --> 01:46:09.276]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[01:46:09.576 --> 01:46:09.956]  Thank you.
[01:46:09.996 --> 01:46:10.877]  I appreciate the call.
[01:46:10.917 --> 01:46:11.638]  Who's up next?
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.741]  Richard and Tejas, you're on the air.
[01:46:17.503 --> 01:46:21.026]  Yes, I was wondering why you had Jimmy Walters on the line.
[01:46:21.666 --> 01:46:28.632]  I was wondering if you could talk him into getting a hold of Farwell, Jackson, Sharpton, all the spotlight grabbers.
[01:46:29.013 --> 01:46:32.219]  And ask them why they haven't taken this challenge on 9-11.
[01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:34.223]  It's the biggest challenge we've ever had.
[01:46:34.323 --> 01:46:35.926]  Well, they're New World Order minions.
[01:46:36.006 --> 01:46:39.954]  I mean, Jimmy hasn't, I'm sure, contacted them because why should he?
[01:46:41.033 --> 01:46:41.213]  Right.
[01:46:41.233 --> 01:46:45.716]  Well, I'm just saying, I know what your answer is going to be, and I'm not accusing them.
[01:46:45.736 --> 01:46:49.638]  I'm just saying this is the perfect time to expose them as the charlatans that they are.
[01:46:49.818 --> 01:46:50.959]  I agree, but this is what happens.
[01:46:50.999 --> 01:46:52.620]  You see, I do as much work as I can.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:56.242]  Jimmy Walter does what he can, and people always tell us, can you do this, can you do that?
[01:46:57.082 --> 01:46:58.183]  How about you call them up?
[01:46:58.223 --> 01:46:59.084]  How about you email them?
[01:46:59.104 --> 01:47:01.065]  How about you get you and some of your friends together?
[01:47:01.365 --> 01:47:03.906]  Believe me, I try to call Jesse every time I get a chance.
[01:47:03.947 --> 01:47:04.567]  I try to call.
[01:47:05.067 --> 01:47:06.827]  Russ Limbaugh's show, I try to call him.
[01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:08.928]  I can never get through like I do you guys.
[01:47:09.208 --> 01:47:10.888]  It's always busy or something.
[01:47:11.048 --> 01:47:15.389]  Well, that's why you've got to try the other shows locally in your area and other programs.
[01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:16.170]  Oh, I do that.
[01:47:16.190 --> 01:47:19.810]  I call KVI, and I tell them about everything you guys have talked about.
[01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.950]  Good!
[01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:21.151]  Like the shots and everything.
[01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:26.172]  And they'll listen, and a lot of them hear the same program, but they don't follow up on it.
[01:47:26.292 --> 01:47:29.092]  It's just like a sound bite that day, and that's it.
[01:47:29.212 --> 01:47:31.213]  I can tell them about the shots and codex,
[01:47:32.829 --> 01:47:35.552]  And it pretty much dies right there.
[01:47:35.572 --> 01:47:39.275]  Well, that's why you should fire out websites when you're on the air.
[01:47:40.375 --> 01:47:40.896]  Fire out websites?
[01:47:40.936 --> 01:47:43.598]  Yeah, just go to prisonplanet.com.
[01:47:43.658 --> 01:47:45.400]  It's got the truth, you know, stuff like that.
[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.620]  Oh, yeah, I tried that.
[01:47:46.681 --> 01:47:47.141]  I tried that.
[01:47:47.543 --> 01:47:57.025]  But the reason why I was, not to put the pressure on Jimmy, but he's got the money and he can actually make footage of this and show the rest of the world who's really defending their rights.
[01:47:57.305 --> 01:48:01.866]  You know, I think it's near a million copies he's given out free of a film he produced.
[01:48:01.906 --> 01:48:02.766]  A million copies.
[01:48:02.826 --> 01:48:04.086]  I think it's more than that now.
[01:48:04.186 --> 01:48:06.087]  It was like $900,000 about six months ago.
[01:48:06.207 --> 01:48:09.427]  And I know he hands out hundreds of thousands a month and mails them out for free.
[01:48:09.887 --> 01:48:12.788]  I know he bought over $7 million worth of radio, TV, and print ads.
[01:48:13.548 --> 01:48:16.709]  And I know he's bought thousands of my DVDs and given them out.
[01:48:17.529 --> 01:48:19.630]  So, I mean, Jimmy's really been in there fighting for us.
[01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:20.270]  Right.
[01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:21.910]  I didn't mean to sound unappreciative either.
[01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:26.632]  Believe me, this man is a hero, and he'll get an eternal flame one day like yourself.
[01:48:27.192 --> 01:48:31.513]  And if we can win this thing... But I'm just thinking he's the one... He has the kind of money that can...
[01:48:32.057 --> 01:48:35.638]  Actually show up at these people's office and ask them why they're not on this.
[01:48:35.958 --> 01:48:37.278]  You know, I know it's a long shot.
[01:48:37.318 --> 01:48:38.639]  I know it's probably too much to ask.
[01:48:38.959 --> 01:48:40.219]  But if I could do it, I would.
[01:48:40.259 --> 01:48:43.820]  I've been trying to get a hold of the people who run this weather modification program.
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.580]  I've called their office several times.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.041]  You know, I go as far as I can every day.
[01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:48.421]  Good.
[01:48:48.441 --> 01:48:48.921]  Keep it up.
[01:48:49.001 --> 01:48:51.581]  And all of us, you know, we don't have to succeed every time.
[01:48:51.642 --> 01:48:55.042]  It's just the effort of action over and over again.
[01:48:55.062 --> 01:48:56.863]  We are having victories everywhere.
[01:48:56.943 --> 01:48:58.003]  Good to hear from you.
[01:48:59.275 --> 01:49:00.155]  We will continue.
[01:49:00.436 --> 01:49:04.357]  I want to get David Stahl on to give you the local view on the American Union.
[01:49:04.377 --> 01:49:08.419]  Then we've got Jerome Corsi scheduled the start of the next hour.
[01:49:09.319 --> 01:49:12.561]  Stahl is trying to get to his office to do it via an office telephone.
[01:49:13.576 --> 01:49:19.160]  I really should have given the network his cell phone number, but Selah V, as they say.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:25.885]  We're going to get both these gentlemen on air for you, and then in the last 30 minutes of the show, we'll continue with other news.
[01:49:26.005 --> 01:49:28.687]  Dick Cheney admitting he didn't know how bad the insurgency would be.
[01:49:28.727 --> 01:49:30.828]  That's a ball-faced lie like everything else they do.
[01:49:31.529 --> 01:49:36.092]  And a lot more coming up in this final segment of this hour and the third hour.
[01:49:36.472 --> 01:49:42.156]  My websites are prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com, dronesreport.com, infowars.net,
[01:49:44.002 --> 01:49:48.326]  MarshallLaw911.info and ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:49:48.346 --> 01:49:48.767]  Stay with us.
[01:49:50.356 --> 01:49:55.417]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.597 --> 01:49:58.678]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.798 --> 01:50:02.699]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.759 --> 01:50:06.980]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:11.101]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.241 --> 01:50:13.102]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.242 --> 01:50:16.563]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.603 --> 01:50:17.683]  The medical bills...
[01:50:19.283 --> 01:50:21.324]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.464 --> 01:50:24.485]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.685 --> 01:50:27.586]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.026 --> 01:50:34.148]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.688 --> 01:50:35.389]  We're good to go.
[01:50:35.409 --> 01:50:35.889]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.436 --> 01:50:59.659]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:59.819 --> 01:51:05.981]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.261 --> 01:51:14.705]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.945 --> 01:51:21.968]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.268 --> 01:51:27.091]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.311 --> 01:51:32.715]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.055 --> 01:51:36.137]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:36.458 --> 01:51:44.463]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.483 --> 01:51:45.043]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.690 --> 01:51:55.370]  Thank you.
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:10.880]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.785 --> 01:52:26.225]  We're good to go.
[01:52:26.265 --> 01:52:26.606]  I think?
[01:52:53.969 --> 01:53:07.819]  All right, we're going to have to jam them together now.
[01:53:07.859 --> 01:53:09.019]  He's on a little bit late with us.
[01:53:09.039 --> 01:53:11.301]  We've got Jerome Corsi coming up.
[01:53:11.341 --> 01:53:12.922]  Let's get him right when the next hour starts.
[01:53:12.942 --> 01:53:18.446]  I want these guys to be able to have a discussion about the situation we're facing.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.942]  David Stahl, of course, has been a city councilman, a police officer.
[01:53:22.982 --> 01:53:25.784]  He's a city manager right now in an area outside Houston.
[01:53:26.604 --> 01:53:28.465]  And he's got CorridorWatch.org.
[01:53:28.545 --> 01:53:34.029]  They have gotten the majority of the counties to sign on against the American Union and the NAFTA Highway.
[01:53:34.369 --> 01:53:35.650]  It's now in the Associated Press.
[01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:37.070]  It's now broken nationally.
[01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:40.473]  It's now mainstream news that we're going into an American Union.
[01:53:40.533 --> 01:53:41.893]  Not next week, not next month.
[01:53:42.034 --> 01:53:43.635]  We're already in it to a great extent.
[01:53:44.095 --> 01:53:46.977]  It's kind of like you're in the frying pan and it's 300 degrees and you go up to 350.
[01:53:48.764 --> 01:53:51.748]  It's happening, and it's totally unpopular, totally un-American.
[01:53:52.228 --> 01:53:57.134]  David Stahl, is it encouraging to you to see this now breaking into the mainstream news?
[01:53:57.795 --> 01:53:59.197]  Yes, it is, Alex.
[01:53:59.257 --> 01:54:08.888]  It's important, and it's important because now some of the politicians who thought they were in charge are discovering that this is bigger than they are, and they're no longer in the driver's seat.
[01:54:11.229 --> 01:54:17.991]  They're going to use the NAFTA highway in Texas in the first leg, the huge transponder taxes, to fund this.
[01:54:18.031 --> 01:54:18.931]  That's in the documents.
[01:54:18.971 --> 01:54:20.231]  Give us your insight on that.
[01:54:21.031 --> 01:54:24.232]  Yeah, this is a big generator of revenue.
[01:54:24.972 --> 01:54:29.133]  Texans will get to pay for this and benefit very little from it.
[01:54:29.373 --> 01:54:37.855]  So here is a tax that's going to be levied against Texans for international commerce, not to our benefit.
[01:54:40.686 --> 01:54:47.295]  For those who don't know what the American Union is and how it ties into NAFTA highways and smart highways, can you break that down for us?
[01:54:47.936 --> 01:54:48.497]  Yeah.
[01:54:48.737 --> 01:54:52.102]  This is really a master plan that comes out of the World Bank.
[01:54:52.583 --> 01:54:54.726]  And it is a means of...
[01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:56.270]  We're good to go.
[01:55:15.174 --> 01:55:18.215]  To create an American union like the European Union.
[01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:24.417]  And if you control the roads, you control the infrastructure, and you can use those as a global taxing mechanism.
[01:55:24.957 --> 01:55:25.718]  Absolutely.
[01:55:26.058 --> 01:55:38.142]  And you can move the value of currency away from the dollar to another unit and tax not only transportation, but pipeline transportation as well, and things like water.
[01:55:40.481 --> 01:55:50.324]  How far along, from my look at it, and experts agree, we're about 70% already into the American Union, and we're just now starting to have a national debate about it, a limited debate.
[01:55:50.665 --> 01:55:53.586]  How far along, David Stahl, would you say we are into this American Union?
[01:55:54.126 --> 01:56:02.729]  Well, I think we're much further along than anyone actually realizes, because it's been working behind the scenes for years, and this is the first tangible evidence.
[01:56:03.549 --> 01:56:06.730]  It was easy to deny when there was nothing on the ground.
[01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:08.231]  There was nothing you could point to.
[01:56:08.291 --> 01:56:09.291]  It was very deniable.
[01:56:09.758 --> 01:56:14.603]  You know, the CIA likes to use the term plausible deniability, and they've had that cover for years.
[01:56:15.024 --> 01:56:31.302]  But when they start actually building the infrastructure and taking it over and you, as a citizen of Texas and a citizen of the United States, lose control over that and you lose it to a foreign entity, then it becomes real and you discover the big picture and hopefully it won't be too late.
[01:56:32.205 --> 01:56:37.713]  Well, the good news is it's so wildly unpopular, you've already gotten the majority of Texas counties to sign on to your group.
[01:56:38.114 --> 01:56:46.686]  You've got many that are now passing laws to resist this very NAFTA highway, refusing to hand their land over to this multinational conglomerate.
[01:56:47.498 --> 01:56:47.998]  That's right.
[01:56:48.298 --> 01:56:53.719]  We have a lot of battle ahead to see if it can actually be stopped, because this is being supported from the very top.
[01:56:53.899 --> 01:56:55.379]  Have you read Jerome Corsi's reports?
[01:56:55.419 --> 01:56:56.119]  I mean, they're good.
[01:56:56.379 --> 01:57:02.461]  He got stuff off the available government websites, what they admit, but he didn't even know they were already building them at the highway.
[01:57:02.481 --> 01:57:03.761]  He thought it was starting next year.
[01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:05.701]  That's how foggy all of this is.
[01:57:06.141 --> 01:57:08.482]  Yeah, and you know, that's not an accident.
[01:57:08.722 --> 01:57:15.823]  They like to keep the perception out there that if, you know, it's way in the future and you have an opportunity to have an impact.
[01:57:15.843 --> 01:57:17.143]  They're telling that very thing...
[01:57:17.739 --> 01:57:27.309]  To the leaders in Dallas and Fort Worth, the mayor of Fort Worth, recently in the paper discussing the fact that they're telling him that he'll have an opportunity to have input.
[01:57:27.329 --> 01:57:28.230]  Well, that's bogus.
[01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:31.933]  The only input that they're offering is on an environmental... We've got to break.
[01:57:31.953 --> 01:57:32.534]  We've got to break.
[01:57:33.935 --> 01:57:37.839]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.159 --> 01:57:38.960]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.035 --> 01:57:50.675]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.336 --> 01:57:52.397]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.118 --> 01:57:54.219]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:55.680]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.441 --> 01:57:57.342]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.023 --> 01:58:01.766]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.187 --> 01:58:06.251]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.202 --> 01:58:08.684]  I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:58:09.305 --> 01:58:10.266]  I live here in Texas.
[01:58:10.286 --> 01:58:12.468]  I've been battling the New World Order for 12 years.
[01:58:12.989 --> 01:58:13.709]  Really longer than that.
[01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:14.530]  12 years on air.
[01:58:14.911 --> 01:58:27.265]  So I know all about the American Union, then to be the Pan-American Union, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, all these stepping stones towards that Pan-American Union, how they're going to use the roads as the international taxing mechanism, really for a regional and then world tax.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:28.981]  We're good to go.
[01:58:29.241 --> 01:58:29.621]  We're good to go.
[01:58:43.895 --> 01:59:00.528]  So all three of us are together here now to kind of brainstorm, and hopefully I can take InfoWars.com, put Corsi's info there, put Stahl's information there, put our information there, and then we've got text.employees that have leaked us documents that we've posted, stuff that's not even on websites where they call it American Union.
[01:59:00.848 --> 01:59:03.009]  We're putting this all together in one spot for you.
[01:59:03.490 --> 01:59:10.255]  It's an orgy of evidence, and now Jerome Corsi's put in a Freedom Information Act request to find out the exact minutes of that agreement
[01:59:11.175 --> 01:59:14.017]  With Bush and then Martin and, of course, Fox.
[01:59:14.678 --> 01:59:17.760]  So we have David Stoll with us, and we've got Jerome Corsi.
[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:19.981]  In a few minutes, David, I want you to be able to finish up.
[01:59:20.021 --> 01:59:27.186]  You were talking to the mayor of Fort Worth there in the newspaper saying that, well, they're being lied to by Centra and others.
[01:59:27.486 --> 01:59:31.629]  But bringing up Jerome Corsi, Jerome, you really hit the zeitgeist here.
[01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:34.091]  I've been trying to get media attention on this for a decade.
[01:59:34.551 --> 01:59:36.432]  You were able to blow it out nationwide.
[01:59:36.452 --> 01:59:40.435]  You got more attention than when Lou Dobbs talked about this briefly last year.
[01:59:40.995 --> 01:59:45.018]  I think we've really generated a lot of firestorm on the Internet, talk radio.
[01:59:45.879 --> 01:59:47.460]  I've been getting calls from Washington.
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:49.982]  I've been meeting with congressmen on it.
[01:59:50.882 --> 01:59:57.367]  I think, Alex, the story's out there that this new North American Union is well along the way of being formed.
[01:59:58.147 --> 02:00:07.454]  And by filing this Freedom of Information Act request to SPP.gov, if you take a look at that website, there are some 20 working groups that
[02:00:08.092 --> 02:00:11.093]  That involved probably just about every agency of the U.S.
[02:00:11.133 --> 02:00:15.535]  government, the executive branch, and I spoke to the administrator there.
[02:00:16.055 --> 02:00:17.335]  Her name is Jerry Word.
[02:00:17.976 --> 02:00:32.501]  When she told me that they had not published the membership of those committees and working groups and that the Memorandum of Understanding and other agreements they were producing were not published either, I decided, well, okay, it's time to file a Freedom of Information Act.
[02:00:32.541 --> 02:00:33.621]  Let's get those documents.
[02:00:33.721 --> 02:00:34.982]  And you filed that when?
[02:00:35.650 --> 02:00:37.030]  It was filed over the weekend.
[02:00:37.050 --> 02:00:39.191]  They received it and acknowledged it yesterday.
[02:00:39.531 --> 02:00:40.931]  Let's shift gears for just a moment.
[02:00:40.971 --> 02:00:42.252]  We'll come back and have more time.
[02:00:42.632 --> 02:00:44.432]  David Stahl, you ran into the same thing.
[02:00:44.472 --> 02:00:48.913]  We have a Spanish company taking over 8,000 miles of roads for toll roads.
[02:00:48.933 --> 02:00:51.494]  There's only 7,000 in the whole country.
[02:00:52.754 --> 02:00:55.135]  And you ran into the same thing.
[02:00:55.155 --> 02:00:57.615]  They told the paper in Austin, the Houston Chronicle.
[02:00:57.635 --> 02:01:00.596]  They told the legislature, we're not going to give you this agreement.
[02:01:01.036 --> 02:01:01.517]  That's right.
[02:01:01.537 --> 02:01:10.065]  As a matter of fact, we have some internal documents from TxDOT where they brag to the concessionaires, the international concessionaires, that TxDOT can keep a secret.
[02:01:10.305 --> 02:01:13.128]  And they have lived up to that projection.
[02:01:13.961 --> 02:01:21.848]  They have been able to keep an agreement that says what we're buying and what we're paying for is secret from the public who's going to be putting the bill.
[02:01:22.348 --> 02:01:36.280]  Our servants, our elected government, in secret agreements with Spanish companies, and would you like to tell Mr. Stahl, again, he's the city manager of a major city here in Texas, would you please tell Mr. Corsi that they're already building the NAFTA road, please?
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.621]  Oh, they are building it.
[02:01:37.661 --> 02:01:40.944]  As a matter of fact, they put in place legislation that allows them
[02:01:41.431 --> 02:01:45.734]  To designate existing projects as part of this corridor.
[02:01:45.834 --> 02:01:49.437]  And they have done that with SH-130 that circles Austin.
[02:01:50.018 --> 02:01:53.881]  And they are already planning a second corridor to parallel that to be part of this highway.
[02:01:53.941 --> 02:01:59.665]  So again, there's spokes all over this main superhighway they're already buying the land for and building some of the junctions.
[02:02:00.706 --> 02:02:01.967]  Jerome, so that was my point.
[02:02:02.627 --> 02:02:06.370]  This SPP.gov group is telling you it's not built yet.
[02:02:06.631 --> 02:02:07.431]  That's Boulder Dash.
[02:02:07.972 --> 02:02:09.293]  Well, I think the SPP.gov group
[02:02:10.253 --> 02:02:12.014]  ...group, which is in the Department of Commerce.
[02:02:12.074 --> 02:02:25.725]  They're really on the track of taking, not on specifically highways, but they're on the track of much broader e-commerce, all the way through all the trade agreements we have, fuel, energy, you name it, steel.
[02:02:25.985 --> 02:02:28.827]  They're doing a whole raft of things at SPP.gov.
[02:02:29.027 --> 02:02:29.808]  Total Control.
[02:02:29.828 --> 02:02:35.252]  We'll be back after this quick break with David Stahl of CorridorWatch.org and Jerome Corsi.
[02:02:36.078 --> 02:02:37.540]  The cutting-edge information.
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:38.982]  You want to know exactly what's happening?
[02:02:39.343 --> 02:02:41.907]  We're going to put our brains together and try to give you the best report we can.
[02:02:46.573 --> 02:02:49.478]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.171 --> 02:02:51.451]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.652 --> 02:02:57.394]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.674 --> 02:03:02.935]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:03.215 --> 02:03:07.337]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:07.637 --> 02:03:09.398]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:03:09.418 --> 02:03:11.298]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:03:24.922 --> 02:03:27.003]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[02:03:27.083 --> 02:03:30.706]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:30.766 --> 02:03:33.487]  That's 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:38.730 --> 02:03:40.732]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[02:03:40.972 --> 02:03:42.473]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:42.653 --> 02:03:44.754]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:45.732 --> 02:03:49.014]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:53.256]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.496 --> 02:03:56.277]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.477 --> 02:03:58.879]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:59.059 --> 02:04:07.703]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.903 --> 02:04:09.244]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:09.444 --> 02:04:13.626]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:14.026 --> 02:04:27.811]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[02:04:28.031 --> 02:04:34.594]  It is so powerful it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[02:05:45.803 --> 02:05:51.425]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.866 --> 02:06:00.689]  In war on corruption, crashing of the lies and disinformation, defending this republic from enemies foreign and domestic, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:00.789 --> 02:06:08.432]  I'm very thankful to Jerome Corsi taking time out of his busy schedule for joining us, and of course David Stahl taking time out of his busy schedule to be with us here today.
[02:06:10.626 --> 02:06:16.051]  Just summing it up, and then I want to get their summation on what this American Union is and what it'll mean.
[02:06:16.591 --> 02:06:19.033]  They sell it to you when it's too late.
[02:06:19.053 --> 02:06:21.916]  We saw this with the EU and other configurations.
[02:06:22.396 --> 02:06:28.121]  As a trade deal, just to get rid of bureaucracy and help promote business and give you jobs.
[02:06:28.181 --> 02:06:38.210]  But in reality, it's global private banking interests come in, pay off politicians, set up unions, American unions, set up these systems, set up international bodies.
[02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:59.675]  Pay off congresses and parliaments to then cede authority to them, and private interests come in, lobby your local governments, they then set up taxing mechanisms that pay directly into these international quasi-governmental and private bodies the very money to then basically buy up land and seize the infrastructures.
[02:07:00.155 --> 02:07:02.295]  So it is literally an invading army.
[02:07:02.335 --> 02:07:03.396]  This is 21st century empire.
[02:07:05.003 --> 02:07:09.145]  Well, Alex, I came to this, you know, writing this book with Jim Gilchrist, the Minuteman.
[02:07:09.165 --> 02:07:09.885]  We just finished it.
[02:07:09.905 --> 02:07:10.965]  We couldn't figure out why.
[02:07:34.994 --> 02:07:36.655]  President Bush wouldn't secure the border.
[02:07:37.235 --> 02:07:49.903]  And you come upon this agreement that was signed in Waco, Texas in March 23, 2005 with Bush, Vincenti Fox, and Canada's Paul Martin, their Prime Minister then, and it's to form the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[02:07:50.523 --> 02:07:58.308]  Well, that sounds innocuous until you look and see that here's SPP.gov formed in the Department of Commerce.
[02:07:58.328 --> 02:08:02.730]  You've got the Council on Foreign Relations report that comes out two months later in May 2005.
[02:08:04.569 --> 02:08:14.491]  The plan here is to create a North American Union, which is a government, and it'll have its own parliament, it'll have its own court, its own executive, and of course it'll be supreme.
[02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:22.232]  And let me just add, even the AP now admits that the CFR plan developed out of this is being implemented by these agencies.
[02:08:22.272 --> 02:08:22.552]  Go ahead.
[02:08:22.792 --> 02:08:32.974]  That's right, and I've documented that, and things I've been writing in Human Events Online and WorldNetDaily by just taking what this Council on Foreign Relations called for and said, okay,
[02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:35.852]  There's a committee in SPP.gov doing it.
[02:08:36.633 --> 02:08:42.739]  Now, they would not release that information from SPP.gov and the Department of Commerce.
[02:08:43.159 --> 02:08:44.961]  They would just describe that it was ongoing.
[02:08:45.021 --> 02:08:52.088]  They wouldn't say who was on those committees or show you the Memorandum of Understanding and the new trilateral agreements they were coming up with.
[02:08:52.188 --> 02:08:54.991]  So my Freedom of Information Act request
[02:08:55.526 --> 02:09:00.209]  This week is to demand that we get to look at those documents and publish them all over the Internet.
[02:09:00.249 --> 02:09:08.214]  They have no excuse not to release that, but they'll probably use the phony war on terror and say, National Security, we can't let you have that.
[02:09:08.674 --> 02:09:09.615]  Well, that's okay.
[02:09:09.635 --> 02:09:19.141]  I've got at least three congressional committees talking to me right now, and if I don't get those documents, I'm sure we can have some congressmen demand them and some hearings that happen.
[02:09:19.321 --> 02:09:22.403]  Tom Tancredo is about to do that, too.
[02:09:22.723 --> 02:09:25.065]  Now, what are you going to do if they're redacted and blacked out?
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:29.681]  Well, you know, they can't redact everything, and we go from what we get to work for more.
[02:09:30.421 --> 02:09:41.884]  And if I get enough to demonstrate that they're making their own laws within the executive branch, which is what I suspect they're doing... Well, Bush has said he's allowed to do that on a score of other issues, Jerome.
[02:09:42.204 --> 02:09:44.244]  Well, he said the Constitution is just a piece of paper.
[02:09:44.805 --> 02:09:50.846]  And if that's the case, I think he's going to have a rude awakening that the American people consider the Constitution to be much more than that.
[02:09:50.866 --> 02:09:55.067]  But, you know, this Trans-Texas corridor is another...
[02:09:55.583 --> 02:09:56.243]  Indication.
[02:09:56.263 --> 02:09:58.064]  I've been writing about it, Alex, as you know.
[02:09:58.584 --> 02:10:00.784]  And the plan there, I just got confirmation.
[02:10:00.824 --> 02:10:03.385]  I'll publish it in World Net Daily tomorrow.
[02:10:04.105 --> 02:10:19.849]  The Kansas City, various agencies in Kansas City do agree, openly agree, that the plan is to go to La Rezo Cardenas to get containers coming in from China, to bring them in, Mexican, not longshoremen, bring them in on trains from Mexico and trucks,
[02:10:20.436 --> 02:10:23.337]  Again, no United Transportation workers, no Teamsters.
[02:10:23.377 --> 02:10:33.800]  Yeah, these are international reservations where the foreigners are really the only people that are allowed to have jobs, and everyone serves at the pleasure of this governmental-controlled body, which is run by Magigo.
[02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:39.961]  Yes, and also Kansas City confirms that there will be a Mexican customs agency set up in Kansas City.
[02:10:40.381 --> 02:10:41.802]  Now, have you seen the document where St.
[02:10:41.842 --> 02:10:42.782]  Louis is going to be similar?
[02:10:43.562 --> 02:10:44.343]  No, I've not seen St.
[02:10:44.383 --> 02:10:46.583]  Louis yet, but I know Kansas City is planning to do it.
[02:10:47.083 --> 02:10:49.544]  And Kansas City says it will be for the trucks going back
[02:10:50.879 --> 02:11:00.579]  I'm sure they'll fill them up with scrap and take it back to China so those containers can go back to China full.
[02:11:01.448 --> 02:11:04.489]  Although the containers in China are so cheap sometimes... So let's be clear.
[02:11:05.469 --> 02:11:05.869]  Exactly.
[02:11:05.909 --> 02:11:10.270]  The infrastructure is being designed via neomercantilism.
[02:11:10.290 --> 02:11:12.010]  This is in their own IMF World Bank plans.
[02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:15.291]  It's being designed to further deindustrialize.
[02:11:15.331 --> 02:11:24.473]  Bush's guest worker total blanket amnesty plan lets them bring in unlimited skilled and unskilled to displace the few jobs that aren't already going to the third world.
[02:11:24.493 --> 02:11:28.834]  Let me get some analysis from David Scull of Corridor Watch.
[02:11:28.874 --> 02:11:29.114]  David?
[02:11:29.688 --> 02:11:32.810]  Yeah, this is definitely the trend.
[02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:39.233]  This corridor will, in essence, become an international zone that cuts right through Texas and the United States.
[02:11:39.813 --> 02:11:45.056]  And they do want to circumvent the ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach and move that to Mexico.
[02:11:45.236 --> 02:11:47.397]  And notice how it's almost military in design.
[02:11:47.417 --> 02:11:55.441]  They're cutting the country in two, and then the larger plans take most of the major highways in the country and make those toll road fee bases.
[02:11:55.801 --> 02:11:59.163]  Unless it's international freight, then it's given the primacy.
[02:12:00.041 --> 02:12:03.364]  I don't understand why there isn't a complete uproar at this.
[02:12:03.765 --> 02:12:07.168]  We were concerned about turning port security over to Saudi interests.
[02:12:07.608 --> 02:12:13.654]  In this particular case, we're going to be turning port over to complete foreign control.
[02:12:14.144 --> 02:12:24.431]  And we won't have no ability to control what comes in ports in Mexico and then come into the United States and may not even clear customs until they're in the heartland using this international corridor.
[02:12:24.791 --> 02:12:27.473]  And it's not just the containers and the trucks.
[02:12:27.593 --> 02:12:31.135]  It's also utilities and pipelines and things that flow from one country to the other.
[02:12:31.195 --> 02:12:40.239]  And by the way, going back here, if you read in the documents for the Trans-Texas Corridor, similar stuff being set up from Oregon to California to New York, we're just a few years ahead here.
[02:12:40.779 --> 02:12:49.683]  That's why when you see similar areas, when you go up I-35 into Kansas up through Oklahoma, you can't get off for 40, 45 miles at a stretch.
[02:12:49.983 --> 02:12:53.045]  There's these big walls and all these ghost towns on either side.
[02:12:53.445 --> 02:12:57.707]  Quote, for security, you see, that's why you can't get on and off.
[02:12:58.327 --> 02:12:59.889]  Sure it does.
[02:13:00.009 --> 02:13:01.110]  Absolutely.
[02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:08.776]  And it's a concentration of the economy along the corridor.
[02:13:08.816 --> 02:13:10.758]  I mean, this is about money and it's about power.
[02:13:11.238 --> 02:13:13.020]  And it's about centralizing power.
[02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:17.393]  And, you know, we're the most powerful nation in the world.
[02:13:17.433 --> 02:13:19.294]  And so how do you beat that?
[02:13:19.354 --> 02:13:26.559]  Well, the way you beat it is you come in beneath the radar and you create your own entity and you take our power away from us and say it's for our own good.
[02:13:26.619 --> 02:13:30.562]  Well, the Romans said all roads lead to Rome and roads were power.
[02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:36.326]  That's why there are still Roman concrete or Roman stone roads that are used today.
[02:13:37.226 --> 02:13:44.672]  Thousands of years after they were built, roads are the heart of any economy, especially in the sprawl design of North America.
[02:13:45.753 --> 02:13:50.456]  And when you turn those roads over to foreign powers, you've turned over a lot more than a road.
[02:13:53.178 --> 02:13:53.879]  Jerome Corsi?
[02:13:54.259 --> 02:13:58.502]  Yeah, well, a key element here is a plan to get rid of the unions.
[02:13:59.122 --> 02:14:05.247]  I mean, the Teamsters, right now the goods coming in from China, the cost of those are doubled by the transportation costs.
[02:14:05.785 --> 02:14:07.145]  And if you can reduce... Thank God!
[02:14:07.465 --> 02:14:11.286]  If you cannot use... They'll get them, Alex, as cheap as they can get them.
[02:14:11.687 --> 02:14:13.727]  They'll get them just at bottom prices.
[02:14:14.547 --> 02:14:18.368]  If China can't produce them cheap enough... Mexico lost that business.
[02:14:18.448 --> 02:14:20.209]  China might lose it to Indonesia.
[02:14:20.989 --> 02:14:23.810]  The globalists don't care where the goods come from, just so they're cheap.
[02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:28.831]  Now the plan is to move them into the United States, away from the longshoremen...
[02:14:29.386 --> 02:14:34.549]  But let's explain that the globalists aren't really free market.
[02:14:34.829 --> 02:14:36.450]  They're engaging in economic warfare.
[02:14:36.490 --> 02:14:42.933]  They're using these rock bottom slave goods made in communist China and slave India to leverage out all competition.
[02:14:43.254 --> 02:14:44.854]  Well, it has nothing to do with free trade.
[02:14:45.495 --> 02:14:47.116]  It has to do strictly with money.
[02:14:48.208 --> 02:14:48.788]  With power.
[02:14:49.128 --> 02:14:50.369]  It has nothing to do with free trade.
[02:14:50.449 --> 02:14:50.889]  Exactly.
[02:14:50.929 --> 02:14:58.171]  With special interests having a bag of economic tools of economic supremacy that no one can even begin to challenge.
[02:14:58.771 --> 02:15:03.032]  And what's going on here is that President Bush has decided to erase the border.
[02:15:03.852 --> 02:15:07.053]  Any idea that he's going to secure the border, he hasn't done that in six years.
[02:15:07.613 --> 02:15:14.095]  If you look at SPP.gov, the way they describe this border crossing at Laredo, Texas, is it's going to be a speed bump.
[02:15:14.555 --> 02:15:17.596]  You're going to basically have fast lanes and a sentry system
[02:15:18.146 --> 02:15:19.826]  Electronics in these Mexican trucks.
[02:15:20.527 --> 02:15:22.287]  The Mexican truck is on the system.
[02:15:22.327 --> 02:15:23.127]  It'll just pass.
[02:15:23.247 --> 02:15:25.228]  Nobody will look at its contents of its container.
[02:15:25.708 --> 02:15:26.968]  That container will come from China.
[02:15:27.008 --> 02:15:28.308]  Nobody will really know what's in it.
[02:15:28.768 --> 02:15:33.650]  It'll just pass through thousands an hour from Mexico into the United States along this corridor.
[02:15:35.010 --> 02:15:36.150]  And no one will stop it.
[02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:41.191]  And mentioning Dubai, it was Dubai that was going to take over the ports, not specifically Saudi Arabia.
[02:15:41.691 --> 02:15:44.032]  When you track down Dubai investment capital...
[02:15:44.847 --> 02:15:49.951]  You'll see Dubai Investment Capital puts $300 million a year into the Carlyle Group to invest.
[02:15:50.491 --> 02:15:53.453]  I've written about this also on worldnetdaily.com.
[02:15:53.493 --> 02:15:55.815]  And that's the Bin Ladens, the Queen of England, and the Bushes.
[02:15:56.235 --> 02:16:03.760]  And the Carlyle Group just set up a three-person group in Mexico to invest in Mexico, and that is headed by Mark McLarty.
[02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:08.163]  Mark McLarty is Kissinger Associates, and he was one of Kissinger's partners.
[02:16:08.563 --> 02:16:11.565]  And before that, he was Bill Clinton's chief of staff.
[02:16:12.146 --> 02:16:13.907]  So you've got both Clinton and Bush...
[02:16:14.451 --> 02:16:15.971]  Being paid by the same interest.
[02:16:16.192 --> 02:16:18.692]  And investing in the corridor.
[02:16:19.092 --> 02:16:19.573]  That's right.
[02:16:19.593 --> 02:16:25.614]  Well, also, all the infrastructure, Alex, because the Carlyle Group's first move is with Televisa.
[02:16:26.054 --> 02:16:41.279]  They're going to buy Univision in Los Angeles, the largest Spanish network in the United States, because they see that the Spanish market, you know, once North American unions are established, there will be no more illegal immigration, because all the Mexicans will be citizens of North America,
[02:16:41.837 --> 02:16:44.779]  They'll get North American Union passports.
[02:16:44.879 --> 02:16:49.661]  Yeah, that's why Fox has said they have the right to travel the western brits of the continent.
[02:16:49.921 --> 02:16:50.282]  That's right.
[02:16:50.322 --> 02:16:54.784]  Another 30 million want to come to the United States and live here and use our social benefits.
[02:16:54.844 --> 02:16:57.926]  They'll be welcomed under this plan President Bush has enacted.
[02:16:58.006 --> 02:17:03.028]  And then we subsidize the cheap workers by paying tax money as the incentive to bring more third world people here.
[02:17:03.208 --> 02:17:09.772]  Well, the third world, this uneducated, poor labor force from Mexico could not be hired by business
[02:17:10.233 --> 02:17:19.431]  ...paid below union and below minimum wages unless those workers were subsidized by the middle class of America willing to pay all their social benefits and educate their children.
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:21.400]  Absolutely.
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:25.382]  One more segment with Jerome Corsi, and I want to keep David Stahl over a few minutes after that so he has time to speak.
[02:17:26.622 --> 02:17:27.903]  David Stahl, stay there when we get back.
[02:17:27.923 --> 02:17:29.603]  I've got a few questions for you as well.
[02:17:30.024 --> 02:17:38.107]  Again, this is totally un-American, totally unconstitutional, wildly unpopular, but the mainstream media, by and large, will not report on it.
[02:17:38.667 --> 02:17:42.348]  The end of the United States is happening right now.
[02:17:42.728 --> 02:17:43.909]  Will you defend her?
[02:17:46.186 --> 02:17:46.847]  We're good to go.
[02:18:08.769 --> 02:18:09.409]  We're good to go.

[02:19:46.696 --> 02:19:49.700]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:58.872]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:19:59.193 --> 02:20:03.879]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:20:04.339 --> 02:20:11.047]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:11.468 --> 02:20:23.242]  It also removes foul-tasted odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:23.702 --> 02:20:28.166]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:20:46.616 --> 02:20:49.898]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[02:20:50.399 --> 02:20:52.560]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:58.444]  Are you frustrated, burned out and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[02:20:58.984 --> 02:21:04.848]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?

[02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:16.542]  Individual needs and personal goals.
[02:21:17.082 --> 02:21:19.285]  Not the cookie cutter approach offered by others.

[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.560]  Final second with Jerome Corsi.
[02:22:06.580 --> 02:22:09.121]  I'm going to try to keep David Stahl a little bit over into the next segment.
[02:22:11.281 --> 02:22:13.562]  I want to ask you both this question, starting out with David Stahl.
[02:22:14.462 --> 02:22:15.582]  We've talked about the problems.
[02:22:15.622 --> 02:22:16.502]  We know what they're doing.
[02:22:16.943 --> 02:22:18.223]  We know who these interests are.
[02:22:19.043 --> 02:22:23.264]  But I want to speak a little bit more about these interests, who's pushing and who's driving and how they're paying off the locals.
[02:22:23.664 --> 02:22:29.745]  And then I'd like to hear briefly from you, David, and then Jerome Corsi, how we defeat this, strategies to stop this.
[02:22:29.825 --> 02:22:30.185]  Gentlemen?
[02:22:31.586 --> 02:22:32.486]  Well, Alex, I'm not...
[02:22:33.672 --> 02:22:41.634]  I'm not an expert on who at the top levels are behind us, but I can tell you within the state of Texas, it is definitely the governor.
[02:22:42.314 --> 02:22:48.216]  Rick Perry has made this his crusade for his entire time as governor.
[02:22:48.656 --> 02:22:51.837]  It looks like he may be the longest standing governor in Texas.
[02:22:52.277 --> 02:22:54.618]  He has done some unprecedented things.
[02:22:54.638 --> 02:22:55.618]  He has completely...
[02:22:56.155 --> 02:22:57.035]  We're good to go.
[02:22:57.055 --> 02:22:57.896]  We're good to go.
[02:23:06.775 --> 02:23:12.757]  He has shepherded in an era of secrecy at the state level that is unlike any we've seen.
[02:23:12.797 --> 02:23:20.860]  There are changes to the law that have occurred in the last few years that condone activities that before that would have been considered commercial bribery.
[02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:28.562]  Never before did you have confessionaires coming to the state and based on how much money they put on the table, able to get contracts with the state.
[02:23:28.622 --> 02:23:29.363]  Here's an example.
[02:23:29.403 --> 02:23:30.223]  I've got to add this.
[02:23:31.818 --> 02:23:39.403]  The head of Texas-Mexico border relations and relations period is a registered Mexican lobbyist, a citizen of Mexico.
[02:23:40.183 --> 02:23:41.724]  The Houston Chronicle had an article on it.
[02:23:42.045 --> 02:23:44.766]  Then the writer got threatened in all these weird governmental calls.
[02:23:44.806 --> 02:23:45.407]  We had her on.
[02:23:45.427 --> 02:23:47.388]  I mean, that's how bad this is.
[02:23:47.408 --> 02:23:47.748]  Go ahead.
[02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:49.149]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:49.169 --> 02:23:51.050]  And as a matter of fact, there's another angle altogether.
[02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:53.672]  You know, we're planning this.
[02:23:54.413 --> 02:23:59.019]  The state theoretically is planning this massive corridor that stretches from Mexico into Oklahoma.
[02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:07.431]  And that was launched and approved and set into place without a single conversation with the state of Oklahoma because that doesn't count.
[02:24:07.791 --> 02:24:09.814]  They're not part of the overall plan.
[02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:14.553]  On the other hand, we have three memorandums of understanding with three Mexican states.
[02:24:15.013 --> 02:24:24.219]  We have agreements between the governor's office and Mexican states, the governors of Mexican states, to extend utilities across the border to and from Mexico.
[02:24:24.439 --> 02:24:28.362]  All right, let's get Jerome Corsi's take on who's behind this and how we stop him.
[02:24:28.742 --> 02:24:31.444]  Well, there's just huge pools of international capital.
[02:24:31.504 --> 02:24:34.846]  I mean, just take a look at the roads that are going to be built in Texas.
[02:24:35.527 --> 02:24:37.188]  They say it's going to be $184 billion to build this system out.
[02:24:39.662 --> 02:24:42.384]  We can multiply that by four or five before they're done.
[02:24:43.184 --> 02:24:53.271]  With that kind of money being spent just in Texas, think of how many people are going to get paid, how many politicians are going to get paid, how many people are going to get paid to look the other way.
[02:24:53.291 --> 02:24:55.713]  There's a huge amount of money involved.
[02:24:56.333 --> 02:25:06.800]  And I'm convinced that these hearings that are going to be started next month by the Department of Transportation in Texas are basically not going to accomplish anything that people think they are.
[02:25:07.341 --> 02:25:09.142]  Money's already changed hands between...
[02:25:09.679 --> 02:25:12.160]  Sitra and the state of Texas.
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:13.161]  And we've looked at it.
[02:25:13.221 --> 02:25:14.361]  So much of this is illegal.
[02:25:14.401 --> 02:25:16.562]  This makes the Enron scams look pale.
[02:25:17.062 --> 02:25:24.626]  Well, this is, I mean, the amount of money involved in turning the United States into the North American Union, into beating the unions.
[02:25:24.706 --> 02:25:31.009]  There's never been a better plan than this globalism of creating a North American union to beat unions since the 1930s.
[02:25:31.149 --> 02:25:37.892]  I mean, if some of those union busters had thought about this back in the 1930s, we'd already be a North American union.
[02:25:38.487 --> 02:25:40.488]  It's one of the best schemes ever.
[02:25:41.289 --> 02:25:42.850]  And the American people are just not aware of it.
[02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:43.590]  How do we stop them?
[02:25:44.071 --> 02:25:44.611]  Education?
[02:25:44.771 --> 02:25:51.656]  Well, first of all, we've got to get people educated, and people are going to have to get mad enough, and they are getting mad enough, and demanding.
[02:25:51.696 --> 02:26:02.403]  There's enough people out there that still believe in the United States of America that don't believe that Mexico or Canada are going to protect our freedoms or our Bill of Rights or anything else.
[02:26:02.423 --> 02:26:05.105]  You're not going to have any guns in the North American Union.
[02:26:05.675 --> 02:26:10.119]  And Alex, your show is pretty soon going to be off the air on hate crimes, if Canada has anything to say about it.
[02:26:10.139 --> 02:26:10.699]  You know that.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:12.741]  And Mexico, too.
[02:26:13.061 --> 02:26:13.422]  That's right.
[02:26:13.462 --> 02:26:15.003]  You could not have my radio show.
[02:26:15.043 --> 02:26:16.784]  You're not allowed to call the government criminal.
[02:26:18.105 --> 02:26:20.407]  Canadians, I don't think, realize how little free speech there is.
[02:26:20.427 --> 02:26:21.608]  But I've talked to their reporters.
[02:26:21.889 --> 02:26:22.289]  They know.
[02:26:22.669 --> 02:26:25.191]  Well, Alex, you wouldn't be just held over for a few hours.
[02:26:25.612 --> 02:26:28.374]  You'd be put away in a jail and a key would be thrown away.
[02:26:28.394 --> 02:26:30.616]  I mean, they would never want anybody to talk to you.
[02:26:31.306 --> 02:26:37.948]  Hate crimes, you can't even say anything critical of anybody in Canada without running the risk of being thrown into prison.
[02:26:38.289 --> 02:26:40.710]  That's coming to the United States with the North American Union.
[02:26:40.770 --> 02:26:43.310]  I wrote about that in Human Events Online.
[02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:46.252]  And, David, I admire the work David's doing on Corridor Watch.
[02:26:46.792 --> 02:26:55.495]  I think we need more people looking at Corridor Watch and reading the documents and links he's uncovering, especially as we get into these hearings in Texas.
[02:26:56.055 --> 02:26:57.096]  I plan to keep on writing.
[02:26:57.136 --> 02:26:58.196]  Maybe I'll come on down there.
[02:26:59.324 --> 02:27:01.806]  Yeah, we'd like to have you in studio.
[02:27:02.186 --> 02:27:04.228]  I'm just about three miles from the Capitol.
[02:27:04.688 --> 02:27:07.851]  Maybe we can get both you gentlemen together here in studio or get on the TV show.
[02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:11.315]  We'll be checking in with you very soon, Mr. Corsi, as this develops.
[02:27:11.355 --> 02:27:12.476]  Thanks for spending the time with us.
[02:27:12.836 --> 02:27:13.316]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:27:13.376 --> 02:27:13.997]  Always a pleasure.
[02:27:14.117 --> 02:27:14.898]  You bet.
[02:27:15.358 --> 02:27:17.320]  David Stahl, can you stay with us a few more minutes?
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:18.922]  I'll stay with you a few more minutes, Alex.
[02:27:19.062 --> 02:27:19.923]  All right, fantastic.
[02:27:19.963 --> 02:27:21.304]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:27:22.378 --> 02:27:27.063]  Keeping about five more, then I'm going to shift gears into some other news that's very, very important concerning the Iraq War.
[02:27:27.564 --> 02:27:28.645]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:27:28.665 --> 02:27:30.687]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:30.727 --> 02:27:32.469]  Continual coverage of the American Union.
[02:27:35.913 --> 02:27:36.814]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:38.917]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.838 --> 02:27:42.501]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.368 --> 02:27:48.710]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:51.012]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:27:51.132 --> 02:27:58.178]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[02:27:58.458 --> 02:28:07.045]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:28:07.345 --> 02:28:12.046]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:28:12.186 --> 02:28:18.868]  That's great news because Calbin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients, is earth-friendly, and completely environmentally safe.
[02:28:19.028 --> 02:28:23.369]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:26.770 --> 02:28:30.333]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[02:28:30.513 --> 02:28:32.955]  Call today for a Calbin Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:28:32.975 --> 02:28:33.936]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at calbinpuresoap.com.
[02:28:33.956 --> 02:28:36.518]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[02:28:45.911 --> 02:28:53.416]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.696 --> 02:29:04.624]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:04.884 --> 02:29:06.685]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.965 --> 02:29:10.266]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:10.606 --> 02:29:21.049]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:21.369 --> 02:29:21.850]  That's right.
[02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:29.157]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.457 --> 02:29:38.045]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.246 --> 02:29:38.706]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:48.787 --> 02:29:49.448]  Hey, Bill.
[02:29:49.788 --> 02:29:50.869]  I'm buying lunch today.
[02:29:51.209 --> 02:29:52.029]  And check this out.
[02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:53.230]  I bought a new car.
[02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:53.971]  Wow, John.
[02:29:54.031 --> 02:29:58.554]  I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about over lunch last time we met.
[02:29:59.114 --> 02:30:03.257]  www.didyourobbillgates.com I did, and you were right.
[02:30:03.597 --> 02:30:08.480]  I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:30:08.900 --> 02:30:11.322]  And it's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:30:11.662 --> 02:30:15.003]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[02:30:15.243 --> 02:30:16.143]  Whoa, that's awesome!
[02:30:16.503 --> 02:30:18.884]  John, your business will keep growing as mine has.
[02:30:19.244 --> 02:30:21.505]  In fact, people are joining from all over the world.
[02:30:21.605 --> 02:30:22.285]  It's incredible!
[02:30:22.645 --> 02:30:30.127]  Everyone should go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com and learn how this program can help them become financially independent, too.
[02:30:30.448 --> 02:30:35.289]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:30:35.982 --> 02:30:36.663]  Check, please.
[02:30:37.123 --> 02:30:38.024]  I got this one, Bill.
[02:30:38.484 --> 02:30:39.105]  Sure, John.
[02:30:39.245 --> 02:30:43.848]  Let's tell everyone about www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:30:43.988 --> 02:30:44.289]  Deal.
[02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:52.115]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.795 --> 02:30:55.157]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:55.177 --> 02:30:59.300]  Bob Dacey, that I'm proud to say is one of my converts.
[02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:00.881]  I think I woke him up about ten years ago.
[02:31:02.022 --> 02:31:02.623]  Fellow Austinite.
[02:31:03.797 --> 02:31:04.438]  We're good to go.
[02:31:04.838 --> 02:31:05.379]  We're good to go.
[02:31:23.579 --> 02:31:29.464]  That's the conversion with the transponders, and they're able to pass that, which they're very close to doing at the legislature.
[02:31:29.904 --> 02:31:35.469]  People wonder why they need $3 a gallon gas increase on average.
[02:31:36.129 --> 02:31:37.210]  Well, that's to fund.
[02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:38.692]  We're going to build the big railroads.
[02:31:38.712 --> 02:31:40.133]  We're going to build the big highways.
[02:31:40.173 --> 02:31:43.255]  We're going to pay for our own destruction, as we always do.
[02:31:43.295 --> 02:31:43.536]  David?
[02:31:44.156 --> 02:31:44.817]  Exactly right.
[02:31:44.837 --> 02:31:45.998]  That's about $3.84 a gallon equivalent.
[02:31:48.132 --> 02:31:56.694]  In toll that you'll pay, and that's on top of the 38.4 cents a gallon that you're paying now.
[02:31:57.295 --> 02:32:13.199]  Look at what we're able to accomplish with only less than 40 cents a gallon in the last 30 years of highway construction in Texas, and now we're going to leap that by 11-fold, 11 times greater an amount, and that money's not going to go to highways.
[02:32:13.709 --> 02:32:24.896]  Majority of that money is going to go to build this superstructure and to pay the foreign concessionaire a huge profit, which, by the way, isn't going to be money reinvested in Texas.
[02:32:24.956 --> 02:32:27.117]  It's going to go into the international banking community.
[02:32:27.477 --> 02:32:33.421]  The money that they've been using predominantly in North America to date, the same organization, is coming out of Australia.
[02:32:34.001 --> 02:32:35.502]  This is international big banking.
[02:32:35.542 --> 02:32:38.864]  This is not investors in Texas getting rich.
[02:32:39.304 --> 02:32:41.645]  A lot of people say, well, what are you opposed to investment for?
[02:32:41.685 --> 02:32:51.390]  We're not opposed to investment, but we are opposed to giving away Texas land and Texas infrastructure for some foreign entity of foreign banking interests.
[02:32:53.872 --> 02:32:54.992]  What are some other solutions?
[02:32:55.532 --> 02:32:58.113]  Well, of course, the primary solution is political.
[02:32:58.733 --> 02:32:59.913]  We have to change.
[02:32:59.953 --> 02:33:03.474]  We have to make changes that the politicians will take seriously.
[02:33:04.374 --> 02:33:06.255]  We're no longer effective at a local level.
[02:33:06.315 --> 02:33:13.156]  The local politicians, county judges, county commissioners are completely sidelined on this, where they used to have sway.
[02:33:13.616 --> 02:33:20.518]  Now we're discovering the state legislators who enacted the laws that enabled this are being marginalized, and we need to...
[02:33:21.098 --> 02:33:24.800]  We need to make sure that they understand what the threat is and that they take some action.
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:25.460]  It's simple.
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:32.043]  Most importantly, we need a governor who will not carry the flag for this foreign invasion of Texas.
[02:33:32.343 --> 02:33:34.044]  It's simple.
[02:33:34.184 --> 02:33:47.691]  In 1913, the private banking interest seized control, and over the next 80 to 90 years, they used the power to print the money to buy up the media, the military, the universities, to fund the chairs, to fund the departments.
[02:33:48.491 --> 02:33:50.312]  Now they have almost total propaganda control.
[02:33:51.392 --> 02:33:51.993]  We're good to go.
[02:34:14.233 --> 02:34:17.355]  Yeah, they're actually creating a problem where they can ride to our rescue.
[02:34:17.675 --> 02:34:21.857]  And the next thing you know, we're going to find that some unlikely foreign country or some international union
[02:34:39.043 --> 02:34:41.792]  ...is going to swoop in and save us from ourselves.
[02:34:41.912 --> 02:34:43.718]  And in reality, they have...
[02:34:44.775 --> 02:34:47.156]  They're architects of the problem behind the scenes.
[02:34:47.257 --> 02:34:53.220]  We have been complacent and gone along far too long and put ourselves in this position, and we need to stop.
[02:34:53.420 --> 02:34:54.661]  We need to stop and take a look.
[02:34:54.701 --> 02:34:55.742]  We need to educate people.
[02:34:56.042 --> 02:34:58.724]  People need to know what's happening, and they need to take action now.
[02:34:58.924 --> 02:35:00.865]  In 60 seconds, David, and I'm going to let you go.
[02:35:00.945 --> 02:35:02.586]  CorridorWatch.org is the website.
[02:35:02.846 --> 02:35:06.869]  Again, you're a former police officer, city councilman, now a city manager.
[02:35:07.829 --> 02:35:09.650]  You're uniquely placed to understand this.
[02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:12.032]  You've got the majority of counties to sign on with you to fight this.
[02:35:13.119 --> 02:35:15.081]  Where are the toll roads right now?
[02:35:15.121 --> 02:35:17.203]  Again, 97% in polls against it.
[02:35:17.623 --> 02:35:18.263]  They don't care.
[02:35:18.343 --> 02:35:19.384]  They pay off the politicians.
[02:35:19.404 --> 02:35:20.465]  They rampage forward.
[02:35:20.985 --> 02:35:22.747]  Where are the toll roads right now?
[02:35:23.453 --> 02:35:26.335]  Well, they're in the process now of being planned.
[02:35:26.715 --> 02:35:31.558]  Certainly, Central knows exactly where they're going to build the 35 corridor from Laredo to Oklahoma.
[02:35:32.118 --> 02:35:33.759]  They're fast-tracking 69.
[02:35:33.799 --> 02:35:35.681]  69 may actually get built before 35.
[02:35:35.881 --> 02:35:40.263]  That's going to go from also Mexico, but up towards Texarkana.
[02:35:40.324 --> 02:35:45.046]  And in Austin alone, they're admitting they're grabbing now not 14, but now 18 major roads for toll roads.
[02:35:45.287 --> 02:35:47.408]  Yeah, they're doing the same thing in San Antonio.
[02:35:47.448 --> 02:35:48.909]  They're attempting to do that in Laredo.
[02:35:49.630 --> 02:35:54.619]  They're talking about selling the rights to operate the toll road in Houston and Harris County.
[02:35:55.541 --> 02:35:56.062]  It's rampant.
[02:35:56.122 --> 02:35:59.408]  It's happening everywhere and we need to wake up and stop it before it's too late.
[02:36:01.241 --> 02:36:12.545]  Are they starting to get concerned when 2,000 people show up to these meetings here in Austin and literally are stomping so loud the whole building is shaking, or are they just still arrogantly thumbing their nose at us?
[02:36:13.085 --> 02:36:18.387]  You know, they are arrogantly thumbing their nose, and they're arrogantly thumbing their nose at people like the mayor of Fort Worth.
[02:36:18.568 --> 02:36:30.432]  And, you know, 100 community leaders and elected officials went from the Dallas-Fort Worth area to Austin to express their concerns about the trans-Texas corridor and that it's going to have a negative impact on the Metroplex.
[02:36:31.076 --> 02:36:33.198]  And they were pretty much told to sit down and shut up.
[02:36:33.838 --> 02:36:42.685]  In a follow-up meeting that occurred in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the chairman of the Transportation Commission stomped out in a huff.
[02:36:43.546 --> 02:36:44.626]  They don't care.
[02:36:44.646 --> 02:36:47.909]  They have their marching orders that come out of the governor's office.
[02:36:47.969 --> 02:36:48.870]  They've been paid off.
[02:36:49.650 --> 02:36:55.855]  You know, the legislative affairs director in the governor's office was the lobbyist for Centra, which happens to be the concessionaire on this project.
[02:36:56.435 --> 02:36:59.578]  Now, isn't that an interesting couple to have in bed together?
[02:37:00.603 --> 02:37:09.231]  Well, the people, the Constitution, common sense is on our side, but we just have to get the average yuppie out there who just thinks everything's wonderful to wake up.
[02:37:09.491 --> 02:37:14.976]  We need to call this NAVTA Highway, and that's what the Trans-Texas Corridor is as a main trunk, the Death of America Road.
[02:37:15.016 --> 02:37:17.798]  We need to come up with some slogan because this is the end of America.
[02:37:18.078 --> 02:37:22.302]  David Stahl, I'm going to get you on very soon to cover more of this as it develops.
[02:37:22.582 --> 02:37:23.303]  Thank you for the time.
[02:37:23.663 --> 02:37:24.304]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:37:24.504 --> 02:37:24.904]  You bet.
[02:37:25.184 --> 02:37:25.565]  Take care.
[02:37:26.469 --> 02:37:29.630]  Now let's shift gears and talk to Bob Dacey here briefly.
[02:37:29.710 --> 02:37:33.031]  Bob has written great articles for the New American Magazine.
[02:37:33.051 --> 02:37:33.891]  He's also a good friend of mine.
[02:37:33.911 --> 02:37:35.071]  He's done a lot of research on it.
[02:37:35.612 --> 02:37:41.213]  It's got to feel good after all these years we've been fighting this to now see it breaking nationally.
[02:37:41.533 --> 02:37:42.093]  Bob Dacey?
[02:37:42.113 --> 02:37:44.354]  Alexa, thank you for having me on.
[02:37:44.514 --> 02:37:48.555]  I am very gratified to see the work that we did last year.
[02:37:48.575 --> 02:37:52.596]  I wrote that article for the New American back in October and they published it in November.
[02:37:53.246 --> 02:38:03.157]  In the November 14th issue, Texas, the keystone state of the FTAA, and you were kind enough to have me on your show right after that to get it a bigger audience.
[02:38:03.618 --> 02:38:08.443]  And I'm very gratified to see mainstream finally waking up to what we did, what you did, what I did.
[02:38:09.384 --> 02:38:10.946]  Did you see this AP article?
[02:38:11.066 --> 02:38:12.027]  In fact, instead of just...
[02:38:12.668 --> 02:38:13.688]  Paraphrasing, let me read it.
[02:38:14.128 --> 02:38:29.971]  Many SPP working groups appear to be working towards achieving specific objectives as defined by a May 2005 Council on Foreign Relations Task Force report which presented the blueprint for expanding the SPP agreement into a North American Union that would merge the U.S., Canada, and Mexico into a new governmental form.
[02:38:30.351 --> 02:38:32.571]  It says right there the CFR is calling the shots.
[02:38:32.952 --> 02:38:41.313]  Well, you know, the CFR, you were talking about it in the first hour when you first mentioned my article, which, by the way, you were kind enough to repost on the front page of InfoWars, and I appreciate that.
[02:38:42.326 --> 02:38:51.151]  But I want to point out to your listeners, you know, David Rockefeller, your friend and mine, is the chairman emeritus of the CFR.
[02:38:51.652 --> 02:38:53.212]  You might even call him Mr. CFR.
[02:38:53.933 --> 02:39:04.459]  And I want to point out that in his book that he wrote in 2002 called Memoirs, he says, and I have a direct quote from David Rockefeller if I could read it here.
[02:39:05.322 --> 02:39:21.913]  For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.
[02:39:22.694 --> 02:39:35.142]  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing me and my family as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world
[02:39:35.546 --> 02:39:39.288]  To build a more integrated global, political, and economic structure.
[02:39:39.948 --> 02:39:41.769]  One world, if you will.
[02:39:42.489 --> 02:39:47.511]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.
[02:39:48.131 --> 02:39:50.192]  That's a direct quote from David Rockefeller.
[02:39:50.452 --> 02:39:51.112]  Oh, I know.
[02:39:51.132 --> 02:39:57.595]  I mean, I always go back to Helmut Schmidt's memoir, where he says, I'm Bilderberg, we run the planet, one world government, ha ha ha.
[02:39:57.835 --> 02:39:59.336]  These guys write books.
[02:40:00.092 --> 02:40:05.857]  Saying we run you slaves, but they know the general slaves will never go read a memoir.
[02:40:06.537 --> 02:40:10.960]  Well, I got this quote from the New American Magazine, and I was going to check it out, so I ordered the book.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:11.481]  It's on page 405.
[02:40:12.081 --> 02:40:13.662]  It's Rockefeller's book memoir.
[02:40:13.702 --> 02:40:15.384]  So, you know, make no doubt about it.
[02:40:15.404 --> 02:40:16.905]  The CFR's behind this whole thing.
[02:40:17.225 --> 02:40:22.749]  And also, their stepchild, the United Nations, is definitely behind this whole thing.
[02:40:22.829 --> 02:40:23.950]  And again, they created it.
[02:40:24.310 --> 02:40:27.773]  The Bilderberg Group gives the orders to the CFR, who then implements it.
[02:40:28.450 --> 02:40:30.812]  Did you hear about my little encounter with the Bilderberg Group?
[02:40:31.272 --> 02:40:32.053]  Yes, I did.
[02:40:32.313 --> 02:40:33.894]  I don't think they like you too much, Alex.
[02:40:33.994 --> 02:40:36.156]  I don't know.
[02:40:36.556 --> 02:40:37.637]  I thought it was great.
[02:40:37.677 --> 02:40:42.461]  I mean, you know, anything to shine the light on the Bilderberg Group, obviously the mainstream press doesn't want to do it.
[02:40:42.941 --> 02:40:51.767]  I also want to point out in the conversation you've had, I talked to Mr. Corsi and he read my article and he fully agrees with everything in it.
[02:40:52.108 --> 02:40:57.772]  But he didn't point out in the article that the North American Union is merely a stepping stone
[02:40:58.260 --> 02:40:59.481]  To the American Union.
[02:40:59.942 --> 02:41:03.925]  That's just the next step in this little plan to... And that's all official.
[02:41:03.965 --> 02:41:05.607]  They call it Pan-American.
[02:41:06.087 --> 02:41:09.671]  Yeah, they want this... They're trying to implement this FTAA.
[02:41:09.711 --> 02:41:12.774]  Well, they even, what, five years ago said, oh, we've chosen the capital.
[02:41:12.834 --> 02:41:13.655]  It's going to be Atlanta.
[02:41:14.055 --> 02:41:18.419]  Yeah, so, you know, it's a part of the greater picture to...
[02:41:20.493 --> 02:41:25.277]  Step by step, destroy national sovereignty before you merge everything into the world government.
[02:41:25.597 --> 02:41:26.878]  And it's open.
[02:41:26.898 --> 02:41:27.338]  They say it.
[02:41:27.378 --> 02:41:27.899]  They admit it.
[02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:30.060]  And I just wanted to point that out.
[02:41:30.181 --> 02:41:30.961]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:41:31.301 --> 02:41:34.144]  Of course, these articles, I think he's just now learning of this.
[02:41:34.184 --> 02:41:36.866]  He admitted he learned of this while investigating the open borders.
[02:41:37.286 --> 02:41:38.707]  We've been on this for over a decade.
[02:41:38.747 --> 02:41:42.250]  I've got Paul Watson doing two big, detailed reports.
[02:41:42.290 --> 02:41:46.393]  I want him to take everything that was talked about today, get the links, the documents for it, and post it.
[02:41:46.753 --> 02:41:47.114]  We're good to go.
[02:41:47.134 --> 02:41:47.534]  We're good to go.
[02:42:06.116 --> 02:42:07.136]  I'll give it my best shot, Alex.
[02:42:07.217 --> 02:42:09.638]  And listen, I appreciate you having me on, and you're doing a great job.
[02:42:09.718 --> 02:42:10.638]  Thank you, Bob Dacey.
[02:42:10.658 --> 02:42:12.259]  Good to hear from you.
[02:42:13.259 --> 02:42:18.161]  Wow, so we had Jerome Corsione, we've had David Stahl, and now Bob Dacey trying to give you continual coverage.
[02:42:18.221 --> 02:42:19.461]  I know we've got a bunch of phone calls here.
[02:42:19.742 --> 02:42:28.905]  Let me just play this clip of Cheney, because their own official documents, P2OG, the 83 Israeli documents, say they want a strategy of balkanization in the Middle East.
[02:42:28.945 --> 02:42:29.906]  They want civil war.
[02:42:29.946 --> 02:42:30.986]  They want weak nations.
[02:42:31.566 --> 02:42:34.708]  They want to have civil wars so they can build permanent bases and stay there longer.
[02:42:34.788 --> 02:42:35.708]  Okay, that was always the plan.
[02:42:36.869 --> 02:42:42.914]  Now he says, oh, we didn't foresee how Saddam in the last 30 years had wrecked Iraq, and that's why it's so bad there.
[02:42:42.954 --> 02:42:49.399]  No, by all yardsticks, Iraq is worse after the 13 years of sanctions, 3 years and 4 months of occupation.
[02:42:49.759 --> 02:42:53.002]  Now, so what's almost 13 years and 3 more years?
[02:42:53.843 --> 02:42:54.903]  16 plus years of this.
[02:42:55.444 --> 02:42:57.746]  Iraq was a first world nation before the attack of 1991.
[02:42:58.746 --> 02:42:59.787]  Saddam was our boy.
[02:42:59.827 --> 02:43:00.548]  They set him up.
[02:43:01.764 --> 02:43:10.467]  And they claim that he's the reason they're having problems in Iraq and that they never foresaw this civil war when they actually planned the whole thing all along.
[02:43:10.507 --> 02:43:12.868]  So here's Cheney yesterday at a press conference.
[02:43:12.908 --> 02:43:13.208]  Roll it.
[02:43:14.048 --> 02:43:26.993]  And from a historical turning point, the period that we'll be able to look at and say, that's when we turn the corner, that's when we begin to get a handle on the long-term future of Iraq.
[02:43:28.053 --> 02:43:31.114]  Do you think that you underestimated the insurgency's strength
[02:43:34.375 --> 02:43:34.956]  I think so.
[02:43:34.976 --> 02:43:45.964]  I guess if I look back on it now, I don't think anybody anticipated the level of violence that we've encountered.
[02:43:48.646 --> 02:43:58.213]  I guess the other area that I look at in terms of an area where I think we were faced with difficulties we didn't anticipate
[02:43:59.045 --> 02:44:08.110]  was the devastation that 30 years of Saddam's rule had wrought, if you will, on the psychology of the Iraqi people.
[02:44:08.690 --> 02:44:23.779]  Very, very hard to go from the way they were forced to live for a long period of time to a situation in which they had the opportunity for self-government, for setting up and operating their own free and democratically elected society.
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:48.631]  That's a huge transition to make and if I look back on something that I underestimated it would be the extent of which that society had been damaged by that series of events that had occurred over 30 years during Saddam's rule up to and including the 1991 uprising where so many Iraqis rose up against the regime and then were slaughtered by Saddam Hussein's forces.
[02:44:50.245 --> 02:44:56.029]  This questioner wants to know, is there any scenario under which you envision the draft being reinstated?
[02:44:57.450 --> 02:44:57.730]  No.
[02:44:59.051 --> 02:44:59.912]  None that I can see.
[02:44:59.992 --> 02:45:02.013]  I'm a big believer in the all-volunteer force.
[02:45:02.093 --> 02:45:03.915]  I think it's produced a magnificent military.
[02:45:04.735 --> 02:45:10.359]  I think we keep the provisions for the draft in case circumstances.
[02:45:10.379 --> 02:45:11.220]  For the creature, Dick Cheney.
[02:45:12.890 --> 02:45:14.751]  Oh, they set off a nuke and released a biological weapon.
[02:45:14.771 --> 02:45:16.072]  You're going to have a draft real quick.
[02:45:16.092 --> 02:45:17.152]  Of course, they don't call it a draft.
[02:45:17.172 --> 02:45:19.053]  They call it National Service.
[02:45:19.093 --> 02:45:21.195]  The National Compulsory Service Act.
[02:45:21.235 --> 02:45:22.195]  The National Service Act.
[02:45:22.215 --> 02:45:23.876]  There's different versions of it.
[02:45:23.896 --> 02:45:31.160]  And by the way, we've had troops that have served three and now four tours in Iraq who they won't let leave the military even though their commitment, their contract is up.
[02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:33.741]  So they're drafting people that already serve.
[02:45:34.062 --> 02:45:41.486]  And even you neocon pot bellies out there that want to turn the whole world into a parking lot, as you say, and kill them all for America!
[02:45:42.566 --> 02:45:44.767]  Meanwhile, America's dying, being butchered.
[02:45:45.147 --> 02:45:50.068]  Bush has radically expanded the gun-grabbing forces, radically doing every evil thing you can imagine.
[02:45:50.108 --> 02:45:52.029]  He's just a puppet, too.
[02:45:52.229 --> 02:45:54.730]  Do you love lies more than you love liberty?
[02:45:54.750 --> 02:45:56.411]  Do you love losing your freedoms?
[02:45:56.431 --> 02:45:58.051]  Do you love flushing the country down the toilet?
[02:45:58.311 --> 02:46:00.832]  I mean, Hillary and Roger Ailes of Fox News and...
[02:46:02.031 --> 02:46:02.651]  We're good to go.
[02:46:02.671 --> 02:46:03.532]  We're good to go.
[02:46:03.552 --> 02:46:04.152]  We're good to go.
[02:46:26.465 --> 02:46:27.106]  Hello, Alex.
[02:46:27.426 --> 02:46:27.626]  Hi.
[02:46:27.646 --> 02:46:32.990]  I'm afraid that there's a large number of American people who don't respect themselves or love their children.
[02:46:33.570 --> 02:46:37.893]  And that's why they sit back and watch situation comedies and have a beer while this all goes on.
[02:46:38.414 --> 02:46:39.435]  Now, you mentioned Hillary.
[02:46:39.835 --> 02:46:47.120]  Over here in New York yesterday, there was a symposium held by, of all entities, HSBC Bank.
[02:46:47.981 --> 02:46:51.984]  And the symposium dealt with database medical records.
[02:46:52.124 --> 02:46:54.746]  That's a rather odd combination that a bank would have an interest in that.
[02:46:55.382 --> 02:47:16.753]  Database Medical Records, and Hillary Clinton was the main speaker, and she went on about how wonderful it's going to be as per a law passed, co-sponsored by her and Bill Frist back in January, that they're going to database your medical records, and they say this is for your own good, so there could be easy transfer.
[02:47:17.486 --> 02:47:17.926]  Well, hold on.
[02:47:17.946 --> 02:47:26.472]  Bush signed an executive order two years ago that even if you're getting a prosthesis, a diaphragm, some antifungal prescription cream, it doesn't matter what it is, Vicodin for a toothache...
[02:47:45.653 --> 02:47:48.815]  Everything you do is instantly uploaded to the federal government, okay?
[02:47:48.835 --> 02:47:52.097]  I mean, where's the Fourth Amendment there?
[02:47:52.117 --> 02:47:52.737]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:47:53.058 --> 02:48:05.525]  Now they want to make your medical privacy, I guess, invisible, non-existent, and what they call a seamless system, this way that this information could be passed from agency to agency, entity to entity.
[02:48:06.249 --> 02:48:19.315]  Now, of course, what's going to happen, as I said, within about a year of this happening, you will see people who have insurance lose it, people who want insurance be refused it, people being refused employment or certain licenses, because you know what?
[02:48:19.755 --> 02:48:33.361]  Within the context of that law, which was passed in January, both by Hillary, for all those dumb Democrats that think she's the savior, and by Bill Frist, and for all those dumb Republicans that think he's a good old boy, all-American guy, the two of them co-sponsored this,
[02:48:35.256 --> 02:48:38.717]  They have so many exceptions built into there as to who could get to your wreckage.
[02:48:38.737 --> 02:48:40.318]  You know, national security exceptions.
[02:48:40.658 --> 02:48:42.178]  We've heard this story before.
[02:48:42.198 --> 02:48:43.079]  Thank you for the call.
[02:48:43.099 --> 02:48:50.201]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.381 --> 02:48:54.582]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the new world order.
[02:48:57.363 --> 02:48:59.364]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:48:59.444 --> 02:49:02.145]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:49:02.505 --> 02:49:06.726]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.786 --> 02:49:13.708]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.848 --> 02:49:15.869]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.249 --> 02:49:26.554]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.854 --> 02:49:32.197]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:49:32.717 --> 02:49:35.378]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:49:45.407 --> 02:49:47.368]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:47.468 --> 02:49:58.150]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:58.531 --> 02:50:03.072]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:03.132 --> 02:50:14.455]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon 2-2-2, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:15.055 --> 02:50:21.902]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:22.302 --> 02:50:24.444]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:50:24.924 --> 02:50:29.889]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:52:19.972 --> 02:52:21.593]  Let's talk to Dave in Utah.
[02:52:21.613 --> 02:52:22.493]  Dave, you're on the air.
[02:52:22.533 --> 02:52:22.853]  Welcome.
[02:52:23.533 --> 02:52:24.214]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:25.694 --> 02:52:29.155]  In regard to Dave, Jerome, and Bob, I just wanted to tip my hat to them.
[02:52:29.855 --> 02:52:37.717]  I was recently in Washington visiting my hometown and just kind of hanging out with some friends there.
[02:52:37.797 --> 02:52:40.338]  One of them asked me if I had heard of Alex Jones.
[02:52:40.358 --> 02:52:43.759]  We were talking about the New World Order, and my eyes just lit up.
[02:52:44.266 --> 02:52:45.407]  Just like none other.
[02:52:45.848 --> 02:52:53.895]  I was thinking I was the only person in my group of friends who really was listening to your venues, listening to the things that you were saying.
[02:52:54.456 --> 02:53:07.929]  And then another friend I was talking to actually works out in some of the Bechtel government areas out near the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, pretty close to where I grew up.
[02:53:08.889 --> 02:53:11.552]  And he is a part of the TIA project.
[02:53:11.572 --> 02:53:13.954]  Of course, you know that as Total Information Awareness.
[02:53:14.034 --> 02:53:14.354]  Yes.
[02:53:15.115 --> 02:53:29.469]  And he is a programmer for the system and kind of divulges a little bit of information regarding that it's largely for the assimilation and analysis of publicly available information.
[02:53:29.910 --> 02:53:30.851]  Yes, data mining.
[02:53:31.691 --> 02:53:33.213]  Yeah, it didn't really make sense to me.
[02:53:34.316 --> 02:53:35.677]  It's simple.
[02:53:35.737 --> 02:53:38.618]  These companies and corporations aren't under the Fourth Amendment.
[02:53:39.018 --> 02:53:44.500]  You don't look at the privacy agreement when you do something, or when you swipe your card at a store, there's no agreement.
[02:53:44.820 --> 02:53:48.542]  They can sell and do whatever they want, and so that's built right into the NSA.
[02:53:48.582 --> 02:53:49.642]  It's called data mining.
[02:53:50.723 --> 02:53:59.046]  Yeah, and he indicated that as far as analysts are concerned, as far as the information, the people who look at the data...
[02:53:59.949 --> 02:54:01.510]  They're segmented.
[02:54:01.850 --> 02:54:05.773]  They're like puzzle pieces that have been broken off into bigger pictures.
[02:54:05.793 --> 02:54:06.693]  It's compartmentalized.
[02:54:07.294 --> 02:54:10.756]  Right, and they're not allowed to communicate back and forth.
[02:54:10.776 --> 02:54:17.901]  So the guy who's working on Hamas and the guy who's working on Al-Qaeda, those two guys can never talk to each other directly.
[02:54:17.961 --> 02:54:20.402]  They've got to send their information upstream.
[02:54:20.642 --> 02:54:24.345]  The only people with the access to the bigger picture...
[02:54:25.602 --> 02:54:30.527]  Well, yeah, the NSA system exposes that it's the government doing the attack.
[02:54:30.547 --> 02:54:36.492]  That's why all these NSA people, from colonels to women to whatever, have gone public saying the government's involved.
[02:54:36.992 --> 02:54:41.176]  Because if you're really listening to the NSA, baby, you find out real quick who's doing it.
[02:54:41.196 --> 02:54:41.877]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:42.277 --> 02:54:43.818]  Call me back tomorrow or something.
[02:54:43.838 --> 02:54:44.619]  We'll talk more about it.
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:47.782]  I want to get to Lori in Texas.
[02:54:47.822 --> 02:54:48.483]  Lori, go ahead.
[02:54:48.503 --> 02:54:50.364]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:50.524 --> 02:54:52.246]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:53.519 --> 02:54:55.120]  Yeah, I have something.
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:58.981]  I've been being under harassment the past year.
[02:55:00.201 --> 02:55:01.842]  I wanted to ask you real quick.
[02:55:02.662 --> 02:55:04.483]  I heard something about you went to Europe.
[02:55:05.603 --> 02:55:08.104]  Which country was that they made you leave?
[02:55:08.124 --> 02:55:09.024]  Was that Amsterdam?
[02:55:09.464 --> 02:55:10.825]  No, ma'am, and I appreciate your call.
[02:55:10.865 --> 02:55:11.765]  We're just flat out of time.
[02:55:11.805 --> 02:55:13.846]  I was in England last year.
[02:55:13.886 --> 02:55:16.106]  This year I was in Canada, and they didn't make me leave.
[02:55:16.126 --> 02:55:16.186]  And...
[02:55:18.488 --> 02:55:20.149]  Let's jam William and George in.
[02:55:20.189 --> 02:55:20.929]  William, go ahead.
[02:55:21.230 --> 02:55:21.790]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:21.850 --> 02:55:23.051]  Great talking to you.
[02:55:23.311 --> 02:55:27.893]  Last week, one of your viewers played that Kennedy speech, and I was spellbound.
[02:55:28.914 --> 02:55:30.735]  We posted it on Infowars.com.
[02:55:30.755 --> 02:55:31.555]  It's up there.
[02:55:32.776 --> 02:55:34.317]  Yeah, now it'll be a few days ago.
[02:55:35.117 --> 02:55:37.479]  So you click on the archive, and you can find it.
[02:55:37.939 --> 02:55:38.519]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:55:38.699 --> 02:55:39.680]  It's like back issues.
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:41.000]  Every day there's another issue.
[02:55:41.020 --> 02:55:43.842]  So you go to the calendar, and you just click on it, and it's right there.
[02:55:43.862 --> 02:55:45.463]  You may have to look around a little bit.
[02:55:46.187 --> 02:55:48.848]  Alright, I'm out of time and I don't like having to hurry through your calls, but I had to.
[02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:50.489]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:50.529 --> 02:55:52.370]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:56.592]  Jack Blood will be sitting in.
[02:55:56.732 --> 02:55:57.532]  Jackie Blood.
[02:55:57.552 --> 02:55:59.113]  He likes it when he's called Jackie, folks.
[02:55:59.133 --> 02:56:00.174]  Be sure and call in and do that.
[02:56:00.394 --> 02:56:01.074]  That's a joke!
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:07.382]  And again, I'll see you out in Los Angeles 24th and 25th.
[02:56:07.623 --> 02:56:08.463]  Sorry if you didn't get tickets.
[02:56:08.503 --> 02:56:09.043]  It's sold out.
[02:56:09.543 --> 02:56:10.344]  But call the media.
[02:56:10.364 --> 02:56:10.924]  Call the press.
[02:56:10.964 --> 02:56:11.744]  Tell them, be there.
[02:56:12.185 --> 02:56:13.725]  Get as much attention on this as possible.
[02:56:14.065 --> 02:56:16.626]  Get our press release off Infowars.com or PrisonPlanta.com.
[02:56:16.967 --> 02:56:18.187]  Help us get it out to everybody.
[02:56:18.207 --> 02:56:22.209]  The power of you taking action is unbelievably strong.
[02:56:22.809 --> 02:56:23.429]  God bless you all.
[02:56:25.501 --> 02:56:26.102]  We're good to go.
