[00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:06.358]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:08.079]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:09.900]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.361]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:13.222]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.682 --> 00:00:17.484]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.612]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:32.415]  I'm afraid he's wrong.
[00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:33.276]  The announcer's wrong.
[00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:34.417]  It's not Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:35.659]  Alex is up in New York.
[00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:40.368]  Confronting the globalists at point-blank range.
[00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.110]  My name is Bob Dacey.
[00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.715]  Alex asked me to sit in for him for the next two days, so you're going to have to put up with me instead of him.
[00:00:49.035 --> 00:01:00.204]  I guess Alex and I were talking about this on Friday, and all the generals are up there in New York, and so the private is sitting here in the Central Texas Command Center, so...
[00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:06.087]  I'm a native Austinite.
[00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.168]  I was born and raised here.
[00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.010]  My reputation in town is that of Ward Cleaver.
[00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.452]  My wife and I have been known by our friends as Ward and June Cleaver because we're so square.
[00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:29.000]  If you know who I am, you know that I own a retail hardware store here in town called the Hardware Store Incorporated, which is the local True Value Hardware Store.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.521]  Again, square as you can be.
[00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:39.987]  If you remember the Happy Days show from back in the 70s, Richie Cunningham's dad's name was Howard, and Howard owned a hardware store.
[00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:41.688]  So that's who we're dealing with.
[00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:46.271]  I grew up as a conservative Republican all of my life.
[00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:47.172]  My family even
[00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:56.461]  Back John Tower for Senator back in the 60s, and I was very happy with that, but I couldn't quite figure out what was wrong.
[00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.401]  Something was wrong.
[00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:16.006]  Back in 1988, I quite by accident ran into Alex Jones on his local TV show here in Austin, and he was ranting and raving about the parks and the United Nations and UN taking over the national park system, and I thought he was a raving idiot.
[00:02:16.106 --> 00:02:16.806]  You know, I really did.
[00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:27.735]  But he got my curiosity up because he later talked about the Second Amendment, and when he talked about it, he was talking about the true meaning of it.
[00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:35.660]  Now, I was absolutely stunned how accurate his description of the intent of the Second Amendment is, the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.581]  So this put me in a quandary.
[00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:44.066]  I had to say, well, this guy's an idiot about the UN and the national park systems, but he knows about the Second Amendment.
[00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:47.468]  So I had to check into his first claim, and lo and behold, I found,
[00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:48.658]  That he was right.
[00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:50.999]  So that's how I got into this.
[00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.339]  Also, the business that Alex was talking about, what happened at Waco.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.861]  And he claimed that there was a video of the government shooting the Branch Davidians.
[00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:07.862]  And, you know, I thought he was nuts there, too.
[00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:12.382]  But when I got a hold of Waco, the Rules of Engagement, I realized that he was telling the truth there, too.
[00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:13.923]  So something was going on here.
[00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:15.683]  So as my...
[00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:31.934]  When I decided to get into this fight back in 1998, I joined the John Birch Society because it was their literature that really was the solid core foundation of the verifiable facts involved in this New World Order conspiracy.
[00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:38.779]  In 1999, somehow I stumbled into a TV show called The Simple Truth.
[00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:45.332]  It's a local cable access show and I'm in my seventh year of The Simple Truth.
[00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:50.600]  It's now hosted by Jeff Kantoff and Kelly Taylor, who are two of my dear friends.
[00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:52.463]  I am a...
[00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:59.416]  Some time, or one time, corresponded for the New American Magazine, which is known as the mouthpiece of the John Birch Society.
[00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:06.001]  I have made numerous appearances on Alex's radio shows and a few on his television shows over the years.
[00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:16.530]  Last November, I wrote an article for the New American called Texas Keystone State of the FTAA, which was all about the American Union.
[00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:27.585]  And most recently I released a news story on Alex's show called It's the Law, Feds Pave the Way to Toll the Interstates as a Part of the American Union.
[00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:31.046]  So that went nationwide thanks to Alex.
[00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:44.389]  So as a result of all that, and as a result of the fact that the people know what they're doing are all up in New York, I'm here sitting behind Alex's version of the golden EIB microphone, except for I'm going to be telling the truth all day long.
[00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:51.071]  We have a little break here, and we're going to be back in a few minutes, and we're going to talk about 9-1-1, because you know what today is.
[00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:56.453]  September 11, 2006, five years after the disaster.
[00:04:56.473 --> 00:05:07.496]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:09.946]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.346 --> 00:05:18.013]  Shockingly classified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:25.739]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.102]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[00:05:29.422 --> 00:05:31.785]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:33.166]  NSA spying.
[00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:34.567]  Secret police torture.
[00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:37.536]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:05:37.857 --> 00:05:41.379]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:43.740]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.982]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:03.857]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.979]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect a peer at home?
[00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:11.401]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:12.662]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.962 --> 00:06:17.545]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:20.160]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:35.352]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.392 --> 00:06:42.497]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.817 --> 00:06:45.960]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:49.603]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:06:49.683 --> 00:06:52.325]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[00:06:52.365 --> 00:06:56.668]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:06:56.728 --> 00:06:58.950]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:17.282 --> 00:07:18.843]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.590]  U.S.
[00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.552]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:59.417]  Call 888-8XANADU, that's 888-8XANADU, and ask for George.
[00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:04.340]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.702]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.162 --> 00:08:12.263]  Alright, we're back.
[00:08:12.843 --> 00:08:15.804]  This is Bob Dacey, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:19.045]  We're going to be talking about September 11th all day long.
[00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:24.627]  If you want to get involved in our conversation, we're going to be talking about the favorite smoking guns of 9-1-1.
[00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:26.728]  Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is...
[00:08:29.904 --> 00:08:42.181]  If you study this like I have studied it, there is absolutely no question that September 11th was an inside job, that elements within our own government murdered those people on purpose.
[00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:43.062]  They planned it.
[00:08:43.242 --> 00:08:43.923]  They executed it.
[00:08:44.964 --> 00:08:48.666]  They executed it, and they've been covering it up for five years.
[00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:57.672]  And it's not a conspiracy theory when the facts are so solid, so concrete.
[00:08:58.072 --> 00:09:00.814]  Basically, you have three different types of evidence.
[00:09:00.854 --> 00:09:04.937]  You have evidence indicating that they were planning to do this and why.
[00:09:04.957 --> 00:09:11.441]  Then you have what exactly happened on September 11th, concrete, hardcore evidence.
[00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:13.082]  And then after September 11th,
[00:09:14.213 --> 00:09:15.195]  All of the cover-ups.
[00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:16.958]  All of the cover-ups.
[00:09:17.839 --> 00:09:19.282]  If you want to get involved, you need to call 1-800-259-9233.
[00:09:22.537 --> 00:09:24.158]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:24.178 --> 00:09:35.607]  See if you can get into the Alex Jones Show and tell Bob Dacey what you think is your favorite smoking gun of 9-1-1.
[00:09:36.328 --> 00:09:40.231]  And I understand that we have Jeff Kantoff has called in.
[00:09:41.132 --> 00:09:42.213]  Prearranged, by the way.
[00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:43.193]  This is not a trick.
[00:09:43.674 --> 00:09:44.955]  He knows the secret number.
[00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:49.799]  And we're going to bring Jeff on and he's going to tell me what he thinks is the
[00:09:50.619 --> 00:09:52.681]  Number one smoking gun of 9-1-1.
[00:09:52.721 --> 00:09:53.282]  Jeff, are you there?
[00:09:53.302 --> 00:09:54.483]  I am here.
[00:09:54.883 --> 00:09:55.303]  All right.
[00:09:55.323 --> 00:10:00.368]  Well, Jeff, tell me what you believe is your favorite smoking gun of 9-1-1.
[00:10:00.608 --> 00:10:11.838]  What do you think is the best evidence that elements of the federal government, criminal elements, did this to the American people?
[00:10:12.298 --> 00:10:14.300]  You mean we're not going to talk about JonBenet Ramsey today?
[00:10:15.052 --> 00:10:16.994]  No, we're not going to talk about JonBenet.
[00:10:17.314 --> 00:10:19.616]  There's not going to be distractions today, Jeff.
[00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:24.840]  This is going to be really hardcore stuff, unlike what you hear on the mainstream media.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.001]  And we're not going to talk about O.J.
[00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:27.662]  Simpson either.
[00:10:28.743 --> 00:10:29.463]  That's good.
[00:10:30.164 --> 00:10:40.872]  Let's just assume for a moment that everything that they said was true as far as the Pentagon and the two towers.
[00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:47.415]  If we just assumed that, okay, so they say that that's true, and we can say that we believe that, okay?
[00:10:47.455 --> 00:10:49.456]  Let's just suspend disbelief for just a minute.
[00:10:49.476 --> 00:10:51.017]  Yeah, suspend disbelief for a moment.
[00:10:51.438 --> 00:10:52.258]  All right.
[00:10:52.378 --> 00:10:58.762]  The easiest and most glaring is obviously the World Trade Center 7.
[00:11:00.544 --> 00:11:08.569]  It's just no building fell without, you know, I mean, the building wasn't hit by a plane.
[00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:16.547]  Well, you know, Jeff, I want to tell our audience on the local TV show, Jeff is one of the producers of The Simple Truth, and that's why we have him on.
[00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:23.849]  The other reason we have him on is because I'm going to toot Jeff's horn here for a minute all over the world.
[00:11:24.709 --> 00:11:30.751]  You've seen the footage, if you followed September 11th, you've seen the footage of World Trade Center No.
[00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:32.932]  7 coming down many, many times.
[00:11:33.372 --> 00:11:37.693]  And the fact of the matter is, Jeff Kentoff, producer of The Simple Truth,
[00:11:38.723 --> 00:11:46.636]  On September 11, 2001, had the presence of mind to keep sticking cassettes into his cassette recorder all day long.
[00:11:47.537 --> 00:11:48.239]  Jeff caught...
[00:11:48.942 --> 00:11:58.144]  The mainstream media, when they talked about and showed Building 7 for the first time, Jeff's video is the one you've seen most often.
[00:11:58.164 --> 00:11:59.125]  It was the first one out.
[00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:04.546]  There's a KI logo up in the upper right-hand corner of it because it's local Austin mainstream.
[00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:14.569]  It was Jeff's video that went everywhere all over the world showing the collapse of Building 7, and so we got to pat you on the back for that one, Jeff.
[00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:16.009]  You were thinking that back then.
[00:12:16.411 --> 00:12:20.593]  Well, speaking of which, today, I've just heard it on CNN.
[00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:44.342]  I'm actually at home sick today, not feeling well, but I've been watching CNN, and they've been saying that, hopefully some other people have some presence of mind, that they have been playing it as it happened, unedited, on their, they have a website, and I missed what they said what the website is, but I'm sure you could go to CNN.com, and they are playing it on the Internet, hour by hour, minute by minute.
[00:12:45.605 --> 00:12:49.088]  And so hopefully that some other people have presence of mind to go and record that.
[00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:51.630]  Are they kind of doing it in real time, you say?
[00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.611]  I believe it was in real time.
[00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:55.653]  I'm not for sure on that.
[00:12:55.693 --> 00:12:59.916]  Well, maybe later on this afternoon, anybody wants to go to CNN.com around 5 o'clock.
[00:13:00.356 --> 00:13:02.438]  What is that?
[00:13:02.478 --> 00:13:03.839]  That was Eastern Time.
[00:13:04.968 --> 00:13:06.910]  Maybe you can watch Building 7 come down again.
[00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:09.552]  Well, let's talk about Building 7.
[00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:12.374]  It had some very wonderful characteristics.
[00:13:12.994 --> 00:13:16.977]  Coincidentally, Building 7 is my favorite smoking gun of 9-1-1.
[00:13:17.738 --> 00:13:23.242]  And one of the characteristics of it was that it came straight down.
[00:13:23.262 --> 00:13:25.964]  Now, understand, no plane hit the building.
[00:13:26.624 --> 00:13:27.545]  It came straight down.
[00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:31.324]  And it almost, it fell in about seven seconds.
[00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:36.066]  This thing is a 47-story modern steel-framed skyscraper.
[00:13:36.207 --> 00:13:38.088]  It's a monster of a building.
[00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:43.671]  And the thing comes down in about seven seconds and no plane hit it.
[00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:53.717]  And it can't go without saying that there was a documentary that came out and they were interviewing the leaseholder, Larry Silverstein.
[00:13:53.777 --> 00:13:54.757]  He was the leaseholder for
[00:13:56.556 --> 00:13:58.136]  The World Trade Center complex.
[00:13:58.236 --> 00:14:00.997]  People keep saying he was the owner, but actually he was the leaseholder.
[00:14:01.017 --> 00:14:01.977]  We'll tell you what, Jeff.
[00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:16.280]  If they've got that clip ready, we're switching which one we're going to play first, but let's go ahead and if you guys can play that clip of Larry Silverstein saying that he blew the building up.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.180]  Is that thing ready to go?
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.221]  All right, let's have it.
[00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:26.262]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire
[00:14:29.497 --> 00:14:31.098]  We're good to go.
[00:14:31.118 --> 00:14:31.998]  We're good to go.
[00:14:32.358 --> 00:14:34.319]  We're good to go.
[00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:58.216]  It's just never happened before.
[00:14:58.236 --> 00:15:00.658]  Well, that's very exciting, and it's the first time for everything.
[00:15:00.678 --> 00:15:08.926]  You know, the interesting thing is that when he said that, you have to understand, people, you have to put your thinking cap on here and think for a second.
[00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:14.631]  The New York Fire Department does not have a controlled demolition squad.
[00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:17.452]  When you go to the fire department school, they don't teach you.
[00:15:17.512 --> 00:15:29.578]  Well, now we're going to show you how to blow up a 47-story modern steel skyscraper in an afternoon while parts of it are on fire across the street from the biggest disaster in continental United States history.
[00:15:29.918 --> 00:15:32.039]  Gentlemen, oh, let's go get the explosives.
[00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.159]  Go in there and rig the thing.
[00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:33.759]  Plant it all.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.722]  I know it takes weeks and months to do it, but you guys know how to do it in just a couple of hours.
[00:15:40.042 --> 00:15:43.664]  And Larry Silverstein is lying in his teeth, and I don't know why...
[00:15:44.364 --> 00:15:45.185]  The man slipped.
[00:15:45.305 --> 00:15:46.666]  I guess it's because he's human.
[00:15:47.386 --> 00:16:13.725]  And as an addendum to that, while we're talking about this, as an addendum to that, while you blew up your own building with the help of the New York Fire Department and admitted to it on a PBS documentary in 2002, Mr. Stilberstein, can you explain why when FEMA, Federal Emergency Management Agency, was conducting their investigation of the collapse of Building 7, you forgot to tell them
[00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:16.304]  And they forgot to ask you.
[00:16:16.784 --> 00:16:18.446]  And you were only the landlord.
[00:16:18.486 --> 00:16:20.908]  You were only the owner of the building, sir?
[00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:27.694]  Can someone explain how that little minor detail slipped everyone's notice?
[00:16:28.134 --> 00:16:32.558]  Well, how about the fact that it's not mentioned anywhere in the official 9-11 report?
[00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:35.881]  Well, it's not mentioned anywhere in the official 9-11 report.
[00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:36.321]  That is very true.
[00:16:36.342 --> 00:16:36.542]  And, uh...
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:52.787]  We have, let me see, do we have time to play the question that I asked Mr. Keene back in March of 2006 up in Georgetown at Southwestern University?
[00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:54.648]  I asked him a question about that.
[00:16:54.668 --> 00:16:56.089]  Let's go ahead and hit that one.
[00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:16.220]  The guy who owned the place, Larry Silverstein, relatedly admitted on a documentary on PBS that he got together with the New York Fire Department and pulled the building, which is a demolition term for taking it down.
[00:17:28.593 --> 00:17:31.254]  FEMA, in their investigation, didn't say anything.
[00:17:31.294 --> 00:17:35.775]  They said the fucking fire must have knocked it down, but they couldn't figure out how.
[00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:44.937]  Video evidence shows what appears to be explosive squids going up the side of the building from the south to the north, or from bottom to top as the building collapsed.
[00:17:46.157 --> 00:17:52.219]  There was bolted metal found at the base of that building at temperatures that exceeded anything normal fire could cause.
[00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:55.656]  There's all the confusion about what happened to Building 7.
[00:17:56.377 --> 00:18:00.999]  Why is there not a word about the collapse of that building in the 911 Commission Report?
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.141]  Yeah, and the answer?
[00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:06.897]  The answer?
[00:18:06.957 --> 00:18:10.059]  Okay, so there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:10.139 --> 00:18:15.742]  That was yours truly, confronting Thomas Keene, the chairman of the 911 Commission, last March, up in Georgetown.
[00:18:15.763 --> 00:18:20.745]  I asked the man, I was ten feet away from him, what
[00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:46.235]  If you ever get a chance to see this footage, people, that is a man who looks extremely uncomfortable with the questions that were being asked of him because he was probably not prepared to answer those types of questions.
[00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:51.738]  Well, you're not supposed to ask questions like that of the overlords, but I did.
[00:18:52.358 --> 00:18:55.320]  And so his answer is, Building No.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.143]  7, which collapsed under these mysterious circumstances, looks like a controlled demolition.
[00:19:01.163 --> 00:19:03.224]  They're not even interested in it.
[00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:06.732]  Now, you want to talk about a smoking gun of 911.
[00:19:06.972 --> 00:19:15.999]  Ladies and gentlemen, their lack of interest in Building 7 is a smoking cannon.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.961]  It's not a smoking gun.
[00:19:18.101 --> 00:19:19.242]  It's a smoking cannon.
[00:19:19.282 --> 00:19:33.333]  Because if you think about it, everything about September 11th, if Building 7 was control demolished, and it was, and the powers that be don't want to talk about it, won't bring it up, period, then guess what?
[00:19:33.968 --> 00:19:35.329]  Back it up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.953]  If that's a lie, all of September 11th is a lie.
[00:19:40.914 --> 00:19:41.294]  All of it.
[00:19:41.755 --> 00:19:42.996]  And there's no question about it.
[00:19:43.476 --> 00:19:44.457]  So we've covered one.
[00:19:44.477 --> 00:19:46.138]  We'll be back in a few minutes.
[00:19:46.178 --> 00:19:50.442]  Call 1-800-259-9231 if you want to get involved and bring some more.
[00:19:50.462 --> 00:19:51.803]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:20:01.664 --> 00:20:09.910]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.533]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:23.739]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.939 --> 00:20:27.582]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:32.864]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:33.164 --> 00:20:39.907]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:20:40.388 --> 00:20:40.928]  What about you?
[00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.330]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.631]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:21:03.266 --> 00:21:04.307]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:04.708 --> 00:21:10.194]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:10.775 --> 00:21:11.255]  That's right.
[00:21:11.576 --> 00:21:13.858]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:21.347]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.903 --> 00:21:29.611]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:30.051 --> 00:21:34.836]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:40.532]  If you'd like to take a look at gold-free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:45.454]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.834 --> 00:21:46.075]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:47.595]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:47.615 --> 00:21:47.815]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.835 --> 00:21:48.115]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.844 --> 00:22:04.365]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.006 --> 00:22:07.927]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[00:22:07.947 --> 00:22:13.629]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:19.532]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment?
[00:22:20.613 --> 00:22:22.413]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:22:22.814 --> 00:22:23.594]  There may be more.
[00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:24.959]  1-800-516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[00:22:54.992 --> 00:22:55.572]  Call now.
[00:22:55.772 --> 00:22:58.533]  Our operators are standing by to take your orders.
[00:23:02.954 --> 00:23:05.274]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:06.275 --> 00:23:09.155]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:10.656 --> 00:23:20.258]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it is possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:23:21.229 --> 00:23:24.993]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[00:23:24.973 --> 00:23:26.454]  's patented methodology.
[00:23:27.195 --> 00:23:38.025]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[00:23:38.645 --> 00:23:41.147]  Star War technology at its best.
[00:23:42.048 --> 00:23:43.470]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:47.606 --> 00:23:48.087]  Or call 702-953-0267.
[00:24:13.855 --> 00:24:16.397]  All right, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:16.457 --> 00:24:19.579]  My name is Bob Dacey, tuning in for Alex today, September 11, 2006.
[00:24:19.639 --> 00:24:24.082]  Alex Jones Show on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:24.563 --> 00:24:29.546]  Again, if you want to call in and participate, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:30.087 --> 00:24:38.813]  Before the break, we were talking to Jeff Kantoff, one of the producers of The Simple Truth, the TV show that I've been fortunate enough to be the host of for seven years here in Austin, Texas.
[00:24:39.553 --> 00:24:42.075]  Jeff, you have something else to add about Building 7, I understand.
[00:24:42.335 --> 00:24:43.016]  Yeah, I just, well...
[00:24:43.854 --> 00:24:45.335]  Not necessarily just Building 7.
[00:24:46.556 --> 00:25:04.930]  Just a last little footnote, and that is that for those of you who live in the Chicago area, given Larry Silverson's very poor track record of keeping skyscrapers in place, I believe it was in 2003, he took control of the lease of the Sears Tower in Chicago.
[00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:10.755]  So those of you in the Chicago area, if you're listening to this, especially those maybe working in the Sears Tower,
[00:25:11.206 --> 00:25:17.350]  You might consider getting another job or working from home because it's a little scary if you ask me.
[00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.631]  Okay, well, I'll tell you what.
[00:25:18.731 --> 00:25:21.832]  I guess maybe we ought to check into the interference policy on that one too, huh?
[00:25:22.573 --> 00:25:24.254]  A doubled indemnity for terrorist attack?
[00:25:24.747 --> 00:25:25.248]  That's right.
[00:25:25.268 --> 00:25:29.572]  Well, Jeff, I certainly appreciate your coming on here in the first part of the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:25:29.612 --> 00:25:30.292]  I appreciate it.
[00:25:30.452 --> 00:25:31.693]  Hey, keep up the good work, Bob.
[00:25:31.713 --> 00:25:32.334]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:25:32.354 --> 00:25:33.395]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:25:33.495 --> 00:25:33.956]  Take care.
[00:25:34.136 --> 00:25:34.516]  All right.
[00:25:34.976 --> 00:25:37.639]  That was Jeff Cantoff, producer of The Simple Truth.
[00:25:37.659 --> 00:25:39.120]  He and I have been friends for years.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:45.286]  We actually met at a gun rally in 1998 on the south steps of the state capitol.
[00:25:45.446 --> 00:25:46.687]  That's how I met him.
[00:25:47.148 --> 00:25:48.369]  Alex Jones was hosting...
[00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:54.874]  A gun rally to protest the implementation of the Brady Bill, and that's how Jeff and I met.
[00:25:55.874 --> 00:26:02.419]  All right, now we're going to get on with this questions of some of the smoking guns of 9-1-1.
[00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:04.861]  I understand we have Jake from Texas up.
[00:26:05.501 --> 00:26:08.123]  Jake, you're on the Alex Jones Show on GCN.
[00:26:08.183 --> 00:26:09.124]  What do you have to say?
[00:26:10.025 --> 00:26:15.269]  Yeah, just talking about the smoking guns, and I totally agree with you guys about Building 7.
[00:26:15.429 --> 00:26:17.050]  I mean, it's completely...
[00:26:17.554 --> 00:26:21.275]  It's kind of completely weird how it falls down on its own footprint.
[00:26:21.335 --> 00:26:26.056]  But what I was calling in today is I'm not real clear as to the motive.
[00:26:26.576 --> 00:26:29.717]  I mean, I think the lack of a motive should be a smoking gun.
[00:26:29.757 --> 00:26:32.757]  I mean, these people supposedly came and attacked our freedoms.
[00:26:32.877 --> 00:26:34.798]  Okay, well, let's talk about that.
[00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:36.358]  Jake, thank you for the call.
[00:26:36.458 --> 00:26:37.859]  Let's talk about motive here.
[00:26:38.579 --> 00:26:42.980]  Motive is one of the biggest smoking guns that there is.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.420]  You've got to have a reason to do it.
[00:26:45.382 --> 00:27:05.278]  And what you need to do if you want a motive, you've got to go to the Rebuilding America's Defenses, Strategy, Forces, and Resources for a New Century, which was the paper written by the Project for the New American Century that's called famously now the PNAC document, and it was written in September of 2000.
[00:27:05.938 --> 00:27:12.303]  And I have a copy of it in front of me right now, and I just want to read a couple of paragraphs from it.
[00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:22.801]  The history of the 20th century should have taught us that it is important to shape circumstances before crises emerge and to meet threats before they become dire.
[00:27:23.902 --> 00:27:28.444]  So, you know, do unto them before they do unto you.
[00:27:29.844 --> 00:27:33.306]  Chapter 5, Creating Tomorrow's Dominant Force.
[00:27:34.386 --> 00:27:40.429]  A transformation strategy that solely pursued capabilities for projecting force from the United States, for example,
[00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:46.502]  In other words, we need more forward bases with American troops all over the world according to these PNAC people.
[00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:48.122]  And here's the kicker right here.
[00:27:48.142 --> 00:27:48.622]  Next sentence.
[00:28:04.403 --> 00:28:16.726]  Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor.
[00:28:17.547 --> 00:28:19.147]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:19.167 --> 00:28:28.850]  It's amazing how these elites get their way when they write their little wish list in their papers that they circulate amongst themselves.
[00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.471]  And at the very back of that document, by the way,
[00:28:33.251 --> 00:28:38.074]  is a list of project participants, and let me read some of the names.
[00:28:38.574 --> 00:28:39.435]  Some of them are familiar.
[00:28:40.075 --> 00:28:43.838]  Elliot Cohen, Devin Gaffney-Cross, Robert Kagan.
[00:28:44.218 --> 00:28:48.501]  Kagan, by the way, is from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
[00:28:49.922 --> 00:28:56.666]  Mark Lagan, I. Lewis Libby, that's Scooter Libby, Steve Rosen, Paul Wolfowitz, and Dov Zachheim.
[00:28:57.429 --> 00:29:00.352]  Now, some of those names are familiar to you, but I'm going to tell you something.
[00:29:01.513 --> 00:29:12.623]  All eight of those people whose names I just read are members of the Council on Foreign Relations, the elitist club here in the United States dedicated to global government.
[00:29:13.524 --> 00:29:15.946]  So their fingerprints are all over this thing.
[00:29:16.206 --> 00:29:20.029]  It's amazing when these CFR guys start publishing papers about what they want.
[00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.752]  Certain things just happen.
[00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:31.746]  And when we get back, we're going to take a call from Laura in Rhode Island, and I'm going to continue, but before I take one from her, I'm going to continue talking about some other things.
[00:29:32.967 --> 00:29:45.154]  And what I'm going to talk about is going to be the 911 Commission Report, which has some more smoking guns in it, or perhaps I'll talk about the Grand Chess Board with Zbigniew Brzezinski, which has even more smoking guns in it.
[00:29:46.415 --> 00:29:49.197]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show in just a few minutes.
[00:29:51.804 --> 00:29:52.685]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:54.808]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:58.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.119 --> 00:30:07.523]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the US have diabetes.
[00:30:07.864 --> 00:30:14.809]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:30:14.949 --> 00:30:19.493]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:22.515]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:04.410]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.692]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:32:06.852 --> 00:32:13.897]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:32:14.157 --> 00:32:22.724]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:32:23.064 --> 00:32:27.750]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[00:33:04.904 --> 00:33:05.344]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.864 --> 00:33:07.405]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:10.666]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.066 --> 00:33:14.547]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.567 --> 00:33:19.068]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:19.648 --> 00:33:21.589]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:23.869]  The ring of fire.
[00:33:24.009 --> 00:33:24.969]  Isn't that the truth?
[00:33:24.989 --> 00:33:26.170]  Johnny Cash.
[00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.051]  And we all went down into a ring of fire on September 11th, didn't we?
[00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:34.012]  Bob Dacey substituting for Alex Jones, back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:45.141]  Before I get into a little bit more of what we were talking about before, this smoking gun of 9-1-1 is the motive that they talked about and published before the attack.
[00:33:45.641 --> 00:33:56.270]  I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that if you want more information about this, the website's infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:33:56.330 --> 00:34:01.814]  You can go there and subscribe for 15 cents a day, and you wouldn't believe the amount of video that's on that thing.
[00:34:02.537 --> 00:34:04.879]  You can also go to propagandamatrix.com.
[00:34:05.119 --> 00:34:12.285]  That's Paul Joseph Watson in England, who is associated and allied with Alex, and whatreallyhappened.com.
[00:34:13.766 --> 00:34:30.220]  You can also, if you really want to see a really good documentary of what's been going on about this terror storm that we've been in for the last several years, then you need to get Terror Storm, Alex Jones' latest and greatest video, and you can get that video by calling 1-888-
[00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:32.670]  We're good to go.
[00:34:51.388 --> 00:34:59.374]  North Austin, at the intersection of Spicewood Springs and Highway 183, the hardware store True Value, we sell Alex Jones videos.
[00:34:59.394 --> 00:35:02.196]  So you can get it from us, too, if you're within the Austin area.
[00:35:02.576 --> 00:35:06.258]  Now, let me get back into this business about motive.
[00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:11.262]  I'm holding Zbigniew Brzezinski's book, The Grand Chessboard.
[00:35:11.682 --> 00:35:12.122]  It was written in 1997.
[00:35:13.965 --> 00:35:16.986]  ZBIG was Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor.
[00:35:17.326 --> 00:35:21.548]  He was a protege of David Rockefeller, the Dean of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:35:22.108 --> 00:35:26.890]  Mr. Brzezinski is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and also a member of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.192]  This guy is a heavy-duty one-worlder.
[00:35:31.852 --> 00:35:38.275]  And I just want to read a few sentences from his book that he wrote for his elite friends back in 1997, The Grand Chessboard.
[00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:45.494]  When he is discussing why the United States needs to go grab all that oil in the Caspian Basin.
[00:35:47.295 --> 00:35:53.477]  The attitude of the American public toward the external projection of American power has been much more ambivalent.
[00:35:54.058 --> 00:36:02.581]  The public supported America's engagement in World War II largely because of the shock effect of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
[00:36:03.143 --> 00:36:05.944]  So you have another reference to Pearl Harbor.
[00:36:06.064 --> 00:36:09.245]  We really need one of these Pearl Harbor events.
[00:36:09.325 --> 00:36:11.086]  It's very important for us to do that.
[00:36:11.746 --> 00:36:16.128]  And then later on in the book, here's another one from page 35.
[00:36:17.048 --> 00:36:21.789]  It is also a fact that America is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad.
[00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:28.972]  This limits the use of America's power, especially its capacity for military intimidation.
[00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:35.083]  Never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy.
[00:36:35.804 --> 00:36:46.829]  But the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion, except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public sense of domestic well-being.
[00:36:47.609 --> 00:36:55.173]  The economic self-denial and the human sacrifice required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts.
[00:36:55.712 --> 00:36:59.954]  Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization.
[00:37:01.214 --> 00:37:01.674]  Wow.
[00:37:02.635 --> 00:37:04.255]  And you want some more motivation, of course.
[00:37:04.795 --> 00:37:12.118]  On page 146, they have a map of the proposed UNICAL pipeline that they want to run through Afghanistan.
[00:37:12.278 --> 00:37:14.119]  He's got a map of it right here on page 146.
[00:37:14.979 --> 00:37:19.601]  Because we need to get that oil from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and all those places.
[00:37:19.661 --> 00:37:22.662]  Because if you run it through Russia, they steal everything that's not nailed down.
[00:37:22.682 --> 00:37:24.743]  So we need to build this pipeline.
[00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:27.614]  And, of course, what happened with the pipeline?
[00:37:28.294 --> 00:37:36.197]  The Taliban government broke off the negotiations, long-standing negotiations, in August of 2001.
[00:37:37.137 --> 00:37:37.918]  Couldn't make a deal.
[00:37:37.938 --> 00:37:47.742]  And so, gee, a couple of months later, we've overthrown their government and we've installed a pipeline employee consultant, Hamid Karzai, as the president of Afghanistan.
[00:37:48.202 --> 00:37:53.924]  And we have assigned an envoy to deal with the new pipeline employee, I'm sorry, president of Afghanistan.
[00:37:54.673 --> 00:37:55.794]  We're good to go.
[00:37:55.854 --> 00:37:56.535]  We're good to go.
[00:38:18.114 --> 00:38:18.734]  There's another one.
[00:38:19.114 --> 00:38:25.056]  All right, now we're going to go to Laura in Rhode Island and see what Laura has to add to this mix.
[00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:26.456]  Go ahead, Laura in Rhode Island.
[00:38:27.496 --> 00:38:28.777]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:38:30.097 --> 00:38:30.617]  Hello.
[00:38:31.037 --> 00:38:31.417]  Hello.
[00:38:31.897 --> 00:38:37.139]  Yes, well, it has been a long wait, but I have a couple of questions here.
[00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:44.300]  The first one is, when are you guys going to organize your nationwide 9-11 smoking gun tour?
[00:38:45.261 --> 00:38:46.361]  For the next election.
[00:38:47.082 --> 00:38:58.973]  Well, I think we have a nationwide smoking gun tour every day, all on the Alex Jones Show and on Jack Blood's Show and John Statmiller's Show and everybody else and his brother's show.
[00:38:58.993 --> 00:39:07.060]  I think that nationwide tour is pretty much ongoing all over the Internet and all over alternative talk radio.
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:13.486]  That's a good point, but unfortunately the signal is jammed, heavily jammed most of the time.
[00:39:14.144 --> 00:39:21.348]  However, I do want to thank you for all the points and the focus on the 9-11 and Building 7 and so forth.
[00:39:22.869 --> 00:39:29.393]  We've got to get rid of this New World Order Empire movement if we possibly can.
[00:39:30.013 --> 00:39:42.701]  My other question has to do with getting some demolition experts to come forward and put their names out or at least put their statements out
[00:39:44.122 --> 00:39:59.150]  Because, well, I did watch the 9-11 Robert De Niro presentation last night, and the buildings just fell so perfectly, symmetrically, textbook, classic textbook demolition.
[00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:06.714]  And so I would like to hear from some demolition experts as to how much time would be needed to...
[00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:24.952]  ...to fully load the buildings, especially Building 7, and what quantity of explosives would also be needed to... All right, Laura, I thank you for that, and I'm going to thank you for the call, and I want to just briefly respond to that.
[00:40:25.372 --> 00:40:26.853]  That information is already out there.
[00:40:26.953 --> 00:40:28.493]  It's readily available.
[00:40:28.973 --> 00:40:33.614]  These people that blow up buildings, that's a very specialized skill...
[00:40:34.714 --> 00:40:35.795]  And they talk about it.
[00:40:35.855 --> 00:40:38.577]  I mean, Control Demolition, I believe, has a website.
[00:40:38.617 --> 00:40:41.820]  I think there's a website called Demolition World.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:52.668]  I mean, all you've got to do is type in Control Demolition in Google, and you'll find all these websites of all these demolition companies bragging about how they blow up buildings.
[00:40:52.788 --> 00:40:59.513]  And one thing they have in common is it takes a humongous amount of planning and a humongous amount of skill
[00:41:00.505 --> 00:41:23.405]  But not that much explosive, really, because they're going after key columns in a time sequence to make sure, like if you want to make it come straight down, you want to make sure the center columns are blown first so everything else collapses into them and doesn't spill out onto the street, which is exactly, exactly and precisely what happened to Building 7.
[00:41:24.345 --> 00:41:25.186]  All right.
[00:41:25.306 --> 00:41:27.828]  Next up, we've got Mark in Florida.
[00:41:27.888 --> 00:41:28.569]  Mark, are you there?
[00:41:29.912 --> 00:41:30.472]  Yeah, Bob, I'm here.
[00:41:30.892 --> 00:41:32.013]  All right, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:32.953]  I've been listening to you guys.
[00:41:33.353 --> 00:41:33.714]  Say what?
[00:41:34.474 --> 00:41:37.815]  I said I've been listening to you guys, and there's a lot of smoking guns.
[00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:41.076]  Well, what's your favorite smoking gun that we hadn't already talked about?
[00:41:42.837 --> 00:41:59.664]  Well, it's one you don't hear about, because I'm in the aviation industry, and I've been following this for some time, and I know a lot of gentlemen in the FAA, and at one point, as I kept reading more and more about this, and
[00:42:00.282 --> 00:42:04.024]  I started to realize that there really was something to this whole thing.
[00:42:04.944 --> 00:42:12.128]  I asked our FAA representative in the area that I work at what he knew about the day.
[00:42:12.148 --> 00:42:16.970]  I asked him, were the ATC tapes destroyed?
[00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:18.110]  He said, yeah.
[00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.191]  I said, was that ever done before?
[00:42:20.251 --> 00:42:20.772]  He said, no.
[00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.713]  I said, what happened to the air defenses?
[00:42:23.733 --> 00:42:27.635]  He said, well, apparently NORAD was running exercises.
[00:42:27.655 --> 00:42:29.996]  I said, so that was true?
[00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:31.711]  Yeah.
[00:42:31.991 --> 00:42:33.491]  And he said, well, I'll tell you what.
[00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.312]  You want to know what I was doing that day?
[00:42:35.332 --> 00:42:37.792]  Go ahead.
[00:42:37.872 --> 00:42:38.992]  I said, sure.
[00:42:39.212 --> 00:42:41.313]  And he got up, closed the door of the office.
[00:42:42.473 --> 00:42:51.894]  He said, I was flying a 747 around the country, picking up bin Laden family members and other CIA assets and flying them out of the country.
[00:42:52.975 --> 00:42:55.655]  That sounds like a couple of really nice smoking guns there.
[00:42:55.695 --> 00:42:56.735]  Mark, thank you for the call.
[00:42:57.395 --> 00:42:59.556]  Let's talk about some of that stuff.
[00:42:59.596 --> 00:43:00.716]  So what he's talking about
[00:43:01.902 --> 00:43:03.604]  Is the stand down.
[00:43:03.724 --> 00:43:08.392]  You've got NORAD sitting on its tail on September 11th.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:18.404]  In total contravention to what it's supposed to do and has been doing for decades.
[00:43:18.904 --> 00:43:21.566]  And let's think about that for just a minute.
[00:43:22.747 --> 00:43:26.769]  You've got the North American Aerospace Defense Command, right?
[00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:38.056]  They have standard operating procedures for what happens when a plane goes off its planned flight plan and then doesn't respond to the radio.
[00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:38.296]  I mean,
[00:43:39.173 --> 00:43:43.516]  If you don't understand aviation, every one of these planes is tracked from the moment it takes off to the moment it lands.
[00:43:43.996 --> 00:43:45.598]  It's handed off from controller to controller.
[00:43:45.618 --> 00:43:47.839]  They just let those things fly around wherever they want to.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.261]  So they won't crash into each other.
[00:43:50.821 --> 00:43:52.082]  Well, here you have NORAD
[00:43:53.667 --> 00:43:58.972]  Has a standard operating procedure when a plane goes off course and refuses to respond to the radio.
[00:43:59.472 --> 00:44:02.975]  They scramble fighters and they don't need the president's permission to do it.
[00:44:03.376 --> 00:44:06.819]  Now the purpose of the scrambling of the fighters is not to shoot the thing down.
[00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:10.582]  The purpose of the scrambling of the fighters is to check out the situation.
[00:44:10.602 --> 00:44:11.623]  Okay?
[00:44:12.304 --> 00:44:18.649]  So on September 11th you have four planes hijacked and NORAD sits on its tail.
[00:44:20.291 --> 00:44:20.431]  So
[00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:22.340]  How did that happen?
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.301]  I would like to know the answer to this question.
[00:44:25.982 --> 00:44:35.527]  Everyone says in the mainstream media, in the Bush administration, that Osama Bin Laden is an evil genius, right?
[00:44:36.268 --> 00:44:37.028]  Everybody knows that.
[00:44:37.108 --> 00:44:38.149]  You've heard that a million times.
[00:44:38.229 --> 00:44:40.430]  Osama is an evil genius.
[00:44:41.811 --> 00:44:46.133]  So when he was sitting in his cave in dialysis in Afghanistan plotting this evil plot,
[00:44:48.974 --> 00:44:55.579]  You would have thought that because he's so smart that he would have come up with a plan.
[00:44:56.676 --> 00:45:05.063]  To hijack these planes and crash them into something real, real, real quick, because he would have known that NORAD was going to be on his tail almost immediately.
[00:45:05.604 --> 00:45:22.838]  Like, for example, when they were, when Payne Stewart's plane went off course in Florida, it was supposed to go to Texas, and it just kept going north, and they scrambled fighters, and about 20 minutes later, they got fighters up there, and of course, there was an accident where that plane made everybody unconscious, and the thing crashed, I think, in one of the Dakotas, but...
[00:45:24.016 --> 00:45:24.776]  That's what they do.
[00:45:24.836 --> 00:45:25.977]  Standard operating procedure.
[00:45:26.297 --> 00:45:28.398]  However, on September 11th, what happens?
[00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.360]  NORAD sits down.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:39.124]  I want to know how the evil genius Osama Bin Laden, the brilliant man that he is, knew that was going to happen.
[00:45:39.504 --> 00:45:45.728]  How did he know he was going to have extra time to crash those planes into those buildings?
[00:45:46.468 --> 00:45:47.048]  And guess what?
[00:45:47.669 --> 00:45:48.809]  I don't think he did know.
[00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.311]  So, anyway...
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:46:04.385]  You have people such as even Michael Meacher, a member of the English Parliament, have come out and they've just flat out said, I'll quote him here, Could U.S.
[00:46:04.505 --> 00:46:08.767]  air security operations have been deliberately stood down on September 11th?
[00:46:10.928 --> 00:46:14.690]  911 offered an extremely convenient pretext to put the PNAC plan into action.
[00:46:16.018 --> 00:46:22.281]  The evidence is quite clear that plans for military action against Afghanistan in Iraq were in hand well before 9-1-1.
[00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:26.443]  So, you know, give me a break.
[00:46:27.764 --> 00:46:29.285]  There's another smoking gun.
[00:46:30.385 --> 00:46:32.506]  And that was Mark gave us that.
[00:46:33.186 --> 00:46:37.549]  And now I understand next up we have Elena from Texas.
[00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:40.190]  Elena, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:40.632 --> 00:46:42.113]  Hello, thank you very much.
[00:46:42.193 --> 00:46:47.535]  I appreciate your own story of enlightenment in all of this.
[00:46:47.615 --> 00:46:48.615]  It's similar to my own.
[00:46:49.275 --> 00:46:57.939]  You guys have also discussed my favorite smoking gun, which is the near freefall collapse of all three steel frame buildings that day.
[00:46:57.959 --> 00:47:07.923]  Stephen Jones enumerates the incredibility of that well in his article, for which he's now on administrative leave.
[00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:10.868]  Yeah, how about that?
[00:47:11.168 --> 00:47:14.671]  For so many of us, this thing is a foregone conclusion.
[00:47:15.472 --> 00:47:19.455]  We no longer need any convincing, although we're trying to convince other people around us.
[00:47:20.095 --> 00:47:24.939]  I've become quite interested in connecting the dots of the who's and the why's.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:35.728]  And my whole study and search into this really started because I felt as a small investor I was getting really screwed around in the markets over the years.
[00:47:36.227 --> 00:47:42.993]  And I wanted to study macroeconomic analysis, fundamental analysis, technical analysis on my own.
[00:47:43.633 --> 00:47:53.321]  That search led me to the whole study of the Federal Reserve and the characters in our history that really create the shadow government.
[00:47:53.922 --> 00:48:03.310]  And so I'm hoping that people will take a look at 911 and understand that indeed it was a planned event.
[00:48:04.142 --> 00:48:07.163]  And by whom is the question.
[00:48:07.283 --> 00:48:11.984]  And from there we can start our fight against this.
[00:48:12.124 --> 00:48:14.065]  But you were reading a quote a minute ago.
[00:48:14.085 --> 00:48:20.047]  And I have a quote from David Rockefeller.
[00:48:20.067 --> 00:48:21.307]  Oh, that's a good one.
[00:48:21.327 --> 00:48:21.907]  Go ahead and read it.
[00:48:21.927 --> 00:48:22.887]  I think I know which one it is.
[00:48:22.927 --> 00:48:23.868]  Go ahead and read it.
[00:48:23.888 --> 00:48:24.928]  Without further ado.
[00:48:25.248 --> 00:48:27.289]  There are several of his.
[00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:31.450]  One is that, quote, we are on the verge of a global transformation.
[00:48:32.074 --> 00:48:37.198]  All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the new world order.
[00:48:37.218 --> 00:48:39.600]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:40.621]  There's a few others.
[00:48:40.861 --> 00:48:59.397]  Yeah, and then the other one you're probably thinking of is, quote, for more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon a well-publicized incident to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.
[00:49:00.265 --> 00:49:17.792]  Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists and as conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure, one world, if you will.
[00:49:18.507 --> 00:49:21.931]  If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.
[00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:22.591]  All right.
[00:49:22.671 --> 00:49:25.494]  Elena, we're coming up on a bright thank you for that very much.
[00:49:25.674 --> 00:49:26.415]  Thank you for the call.
[00:49:26.655 --> 00:49:27.616]  She's absolutely right.
[00:49:28.037 --> 00:49:35.064]  That's out of David Rockefeller's own book called Memoirs, published in 2002, and it's on page 405.
[00:49:35.444 --> 00:49:40.349]  David Rockefeller, Dean of the Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission.
[00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:46.592]  Admitting that he's working against the best interest of the United States of America, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:47.032 --> 00:49:47.933]  It's not my claim.
[00:49:48.453 --> 00:49:49.153]  It's his claim.
[00:49:50.134 --> 00:49:52.495]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:49:52.935 --> 00:49:59.438]  Another smoking gun of motivation to take down the United States of America.
[00:50:00.819 --> 00:50:01.199]  All right.
[00:50:01.279 --> 00:50:02.760]  We're coming up on another break here.
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.502]  And after the break, we're going to continue this discussion of 9-1-1, the smoking guns.
[00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:15.970]  We are on a commercial break, aren't we, guys?
[00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.630]  Oh, really?
[00:50:18.551 --> 00:50:19.491]  I got 40 seconds.
[00:50:19.551 --> 00:50:19.871]  All right.
[00:50:19.911 --> 00:50:21.912]  Well, again, let me give out the number.
[00:50:22.192 --> 00:50:23.493]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:23.513 --> 00:50:30.176]  This is the Alex Jones Show on GCN, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:50:30.856 --> 00:50:31.917]  My name is Bob Dacey.
[00:50:31.977 --> 00:50:35.418]  I'll be filling in for Alex for today and tomorrow.
[00:50:36.499 --> 00:50:39.120]  Website's infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.821]  Be back in three minutes.
[00:50:41.081 --> 00:50:41.341]  Take care.
[00:50:44.566 --> 00:50:45.489]  We're good to go.
[00:51:05.018 --> 00:51:08.179]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:10.479]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.839 --> 00:51:18.501]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.181 --> 00:51:26.222]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.643 --> 00:51:29.583]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.903 --> 00:51:32.284]  The White House programmed to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.704 --> 00:51:33.524]  NSA spies.
[00:51:34.933 --> 00:51:38.014]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:51:38.354 --> 00:51:41.874]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.335 --> 00:51:44.255]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.595 --> 00:51:48.496]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.003 --> 00:52:04.885]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:52:05.225 --> 00:52:08.108]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:52:08.328 --> 00:52:14.532]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:52:14.912 --> 00:52:22.218]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:52:22.398 --> 00:52:26.501]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[00:52:58.032 --> 00:53:03.075]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[00:53:03.395 --> 00:53:10.778]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:18.721]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[00:53:18.921 --> 00:53:20.002]  And there's no odor.
[00:53:20.262 --> 00:53:30.267]  Stabilized Allison gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[00:53:30.327 --> 00:53:38.550]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:44.413]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[00:53:44.873 --> 00:53:53.438]  Visit truthandexcellence.com, click the Truth and Excellence banner on GCNlive.com, or call me, Amy Bjorklund, personally, at 805-595-2711.
[00:53:53.458 --> 00:53:53.498]  805-595-2711.
[00:54:10.229 --> 00:54:19.977]  And that's what we're trying to preserve right now is liberty for their descendants, which is us.
[00:54:38.237 --> 00:54:48.147]  And our liberty is under attack by the criminal globalist crowd which has seized control of our federal government at the highest levels.
[00:54:49.108 --> 00:54:51.991]  And of course they run just about everything else too at the highest levels.
[00:54:53.512 --> 00:54:59.118]  One of the common threads going through most of them that are Americans are that they're members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:55:00.046 --> 00:55:04.988]  This is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones on GCN Communications Network.
[00:55:05.529 --> 00:55:20.076]  We've been talking about the people's favorite 911 smoking guns, the proof which is absolutely vast, absolutely vast, that September 11th was an inside job.
[00:55:21.058 --> 00:55:28.780]  You know, it's not some one little hair out of place and some weirdo conspiracy theorist jumps on it and says, Aha!
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:33.021]  The whole thing is a sham because of one little nitpicking little thing.
[00:55:33.061 --> 00:55:33.982]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:55:34.902 --> 00:55:38.143]  It is a cacophony of evidence.
[00:55:38.323 --> 00:55:42.824]  It is a mountain of evidence of all different types.
[00:55:42.884 --> 00:55:44.244]  And that's what we're discussing right now.
[00:55:44.284 --> 00:55:48.766]  Now, we have next John from New York calling in to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:48.826 --> 00:55:49.466]  John, are you there?
[00:55:49.486 --> 00:55:50.366]  Hey, how are you?
[00:55:50.663 --> 00:55:51.204]  Pretty good.
[00:55:51.244 --> 00:55:52.084]  What's on your mind?
[00:55:52.605 --> 00:55:54.967]  There's so many smoking guns on 9-11.
[00:55:55.147 --> 00:55:59.851]  I mean, I just think that everybody's just brainwashed under mass mind control.
[00:55:59.891 --> 00:56:06.177]  I mean, Building 7, the way Tower 1 and 2 went down, I mean, when they went down, it's obvious.
[00:56:06.217 --> 00:56:09.059]  And then Building 7, that's the spit in the face.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.741]  That's just them telling us, yeah, we did it.
[00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:14.624]  We want you to know that we did it.
[00:56:15.177 --> 00:56:29.743]  You really do have to be almost brain-dead to look at Building 7 and think that 9-1-1 was done by 19 crazy Arabs led by some guy in dialysis in a cave in Afghanistan.
[00:56:30.284 --> 00:56:30.884]  L-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:56:31.504 --> 00:56:32.485]  L-C-I-A-D-A is right.
[00:56:32.505 --> 00:56:35.066]  Great take care, man.
[00:56:35.106 --> 00:56:36.266]  You're doing a great job.
[00:56:36.286 --> 00:56:39.868]  Well, I appreciate the call, and I'm going to use that to kick off this next segment of the show.
[00:56:39.908 --> 00:56:42.889]  We're going to talk about the controlled demolition of 1 and 2.
[00:56:42.949 --> 00:56:43.910]  Thank you for the call, John.
[00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:44.610]  I appreciate it.
[00:56:45.393 --> 00:56:46.573]  All right, now let's think about it.
[00:56:46.593 --> 00:56:50.414]  John was talking about building number one and building number two.
[00:56:50.874 --> 00:57:09.499]  You know, I've stayed away from one and two on my show for years and years because the average Joe can sit there, you know, the beer-guzzling, football-watching American who doesn't think he has a responsibility to look out after the best interests of his country and all he cares about is football and American Idol, those people.
[00:57:10.879 --> 00:57:15.901]  They can look at a plane hitting a tower and say, okay, plane hits tower, tower falls down.
[00:57:16.222 --> 00:57:17.602]  Plane hits tower, tower falls down.
[00:57:18.322 --> 00:57:23.505]  And that's why I have always concentrated on Building 7 because no plane hits tower, tower falls down.
[00:57:24.025 --> 00:57:33.749]  Even that type of person, you might be able to crack his thick skull enough to make him realize that September 11th is a scam, right?
[00:57:34.229 --> 00:57:38.731]  But number one and number two, but now there's so much evidence that's come out on one and two.
[00:57:40.239 --> 00:57:46.606]  Which is really irrefutable that they also were controlled, demolished.
[00:57:47.567 --> 00:57:51.651]  And one of them, of course, we're talking about the pancake collapses.
[00:57:52.232 --> 00:57:53.533]  Well, guess what?
[00:57:53.573 --> 00:57:55.335]  That's the standard deal.
[00:57:55.896 --> 00:58:01.962]  However, the problem with the pancake collapse thing is the hundreds of witnesses, and I'm talking about
[00:58:02.694 --> 00:58:21.485]  Hundreds of witnesses, firefighters, policemen, bystanders, janitors, that will tell you that they heard bombs going off in those buildings before they collapsed, and even before the first plane hit the North Tower.
[00:58:22.546 --> 00:58:25.608]  We're going to be getting into that after the break.
[00:58:25.888 --> 00:58:27.169]  We're going to be coming up on the
[00:58:27.765 --> 00:58:33.271]  The second hour of the Alex Jones Show here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:34.992]  If you want to call, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:35.113 --> 00:58:40.578]  And we'll get to George in Indiana.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.224]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7600.
[00:58:57.352 --> 00:58:57.993]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.673 --> 00:58:59.733]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.433 --> 00:59:01.534]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.194 --> 00:59:03.014]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.754 --> 00:59:04.674]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.335 --> 00:59:09.095]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.516 --> 00:59:13.577]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.413 --> 00:59:19.194]  Once again, it's not Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.254 --> 00:59:24.195]  He's up in New York City right now, fighting the New World Order at point-blank range.
[00:59:24.215 --> 00:59:25.576]  My name is Bob Dacey.
[00:59:26.536 --> 00:59:32.298]  I am a local television talk show host of a TV show on cable called The Simple Truth.
[00:59:33.338 --> 00:59:40.341]  And I'm sitting here in the Central Texas Command Center in Alex Jones' absence.
[00:59:41.141 --> 00:59:43.802]  And guys, is Leah on the line yet?
[00:59:45.976 --> 00:59:46.357]  Not yet.
[00:59:46.417 --> 00:59:46.677]  Okay.
[00:59:46.737 --> 00:59:51.084]  Well, what we're going to do then, we've been talking about controlled demolition.
[00:59:51.744 --> 00:59:56.151]  And the previous caller was talking about building number one and building number two.
[00:59:57.208 --> 01:00:00.990]  And let's go into this a little bit more.
[01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:11.736]  One of my favorite smoking guns of September 11th is the janitor, the senior North Tower janitor, William Rodriguez.
[01:00:12.637 --> 01:00:17.539]  We've been working in the building for 20 years, and the man was, he's a hero.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.680]  He saved so many people's lives.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.482]  He had the master key to the whole complex.
[01:00:23.049 --> 01:00:23.429]  We're good to go.
[01:00:51.167 --> 01:01:16.052]  was in the sub level 1 basement area that morning with about 13 or 14 other people and the first thing that happened was a gigantic explosion from underneath from the basement levels below where he was he says the explosion was so large that it lifted them up off their their feet it pushed from underneath it caused the fault ceiling up
[01:01:17.878 --> 01:01:18.779]  We're good to go.
[01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:18.939]  I think?
[01:01:37.425 --> 01:01:40.786]  A few seconds after that, a man comes screaming into the room.
[01:01:41.626 --> 01:01:43.467]  His skin's all pockmarked.
[01:01:43.507 --> 01:01:44.787]  His arms are burnt.
[01:01:44.847 --> 01:01:46.608]  His skin is hanging off of his arms.
[01:01:46.628 --> 01:01:53.029]  A man named Felipe David screaming, explosion, explosion, explosion.
[01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:57.090]  Now, this is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:59.851]  It's a stone-cold fact.
[01:02:01.539 --> 01:02:07.642]  A bomb or bombs went off in the basement area of the North Tower before the first plane hit.
[01:02:08.543 --> 01:02:12.665]  And this is huge, huge evidence.
[01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:16.226]  Now, what happened with the hero, William Rodriguez?
[01:02:16.887 --> 01:02:21.669]  Well, gee, he testified before the 911 Commission.
[01:02:21.809 --> 01:02:30.053]  My friend, Governor Thomas Keene and his happy little band of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil monkeys.
[01:02:31.094 --> 01:02:31.194]  And
[01:02:31.883 --> 01:02:34.424]  His testimony was given in private.
[01:02:34.544 --> 01:02:35.324]  It wasn't public.
[01:02:35.424 --> 01:02:36.444]  I wonder why.
[01:02:37.164 --> 01:02:48.027]  And if you look at the 911 Commission report, the 571-page lie that it is, you will find exactly how many words from William Rodriguez.
[01:02:48.067 --> 01:02:49.287]  Well, I got news for you.
[01:02:49.367 --> 01:02:51.327]  You will find none.
[01:02:52.108 --> 01:02:54.008]  Absolutely none.
[01:02:54.828 --> 01:02:56.629]  Now, let's go to...
[01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:01.612]  George in Indiana has been waiting a long time.
[01:03:01.672 --> 01:03:04.893]  George, you're up next on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:05.734 --> 01:03:07.135]  Hey, I'm glad to be here.
[01:03:07.215 --> 01:03:10.757]  I tell you what, you guys, I've got my favorite smoking gun.
[01:03:10.797 --> 01:03:13.218]  It's the Pentagon.
[01:03:13.338 --> 01:03:14.178]  The Pentagon.
[01:03:14.279 --> 01:03:14.979]  Tell us about it.
[01:03:15.399 --> 01:03:28.026]  Well, to start with, if those jets were full of fuel, why then didn't I see a fire that would last more than just a little while and right in where it went
[01:03:28.703 --> 01:03:29.904]  George, we're coming up on a break.
[01:03:29.964 --> 01:03:30.785]  I'll give you
[01:03:56.318 --> 01:03:59.481]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:59.821 --> 01:04:01.763]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:02.123 --> 01:04:09.789]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:17.515]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:20.878]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq.
[01:04:21.198 --> 01:04:23.580]  The White House probing to disseminate fake news.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.821]  NSA spies.
[01:04:25.293 --> 01:04:26.013]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:26.093 --> 01:04:27.654]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04:53.286 --> 01:04:54.207]  We're good to go.
[01:04:54.247 --> 01:04:54.908]  We're good to go.
[01:05:14.249 --> 01:05:21.213]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:05:21.373 --> 01:05:23.454]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:05:41.585 --> 01:05:43.326]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:05:43.466 --> 01:05:43.707]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:52.972 --> 01:05:58.976]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails, so I thought I was destined to wear tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes at the beach.
[01:05:59.396 --> 01:06:02.038]  And then my podiatrist told me about Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:02.198 --> 01:06:06.801]  It tackles unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem, yellowing carrots and debris buildup.
[01:06:06.981 --> 01:06:11.805]  With regular use, Non-X Gel breaks down and removes the debris, so toenails look clear.
[01:06:11.985 --> 01:06:16.708]  This summer, I'm wearing open-toed sandals again, thanks to a topical natural gel called Non-X.
[01:06:16.928 --> 01:06:19.610]  If your toenails are embarrassing, I recommend Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.732]  It's at your pharmacy or mass retailer in the foot care section.
[01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:25.033]  Looking for profit?
[01:06:25.093 --> 01:06:26.474]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:06:26.734 --> 01:06:30.036]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[01:06:30.076 --> 01:06:37.641]  This low-vintage collector coin with a total series vintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[01:06:37.701 --> 01:06:41.243]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[01:06:41.463 --> 01:06:42.984]  Secure your position today.
[01:06:43.284 --> 01:06:44.525]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:44.545 --> 01:06:44.785]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:58.190]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.850 --> 01:06:59.910]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:01.751]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.371 --> 01:07:03.211]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.951 --> 01:07:04.831]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.851 --> 01:07:09.413]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:23.584]  All right, once again, this is Bob Dacey, host of The Simple Truth in Austin, Texas, substituting for Alex Jones while he's in New York.
[01:07:24.084 --> 01:07:29.605]  I was talking to George before the break about the Pentagon, and we ran into a break, and George, continue.
[01:07:29.685 --> 01:07:30.906]  What is the point you want to make?
[01:07:31.586 --> 01:07:38.147]  Okay, the other thing is, when have you ever seen a professor or a detective do janitorial work?
[01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:44.408]  These guys were in white shirts, black ties, walking the field, picking up material that had been in that crash.
[01:07:44.864 --> 01:07:46.464]  That was not their job.
[01:07:46.944 --> 01:07:47.525]  Absolutely.
[01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:54.946]  So they were covering something up, and they also lined up about 50 people and baby-stepped across that place to pick up absolutely everything.
[01:07:55.326 --> 01:07:56.927]  Why, if they're not going to reassemble it?
[01:07:57.427 --> 01:07:58.707]  You've got a good point there, George.
[01:07:58.747 --> 01:07:59.947]  Thank you very much for the call.
[01:07:59.967 --> 01:08:02.108]  You know, that's an interesting point that he's got there.
[01:08:03.508 --> 01:08:10.529]  They were going around picking up pieces of whatever hit the Pentagon that day when you know that you're not supposed to touch anything.
[01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.310]  You had people running around picking up
[01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:15.435]  Airplane parts?
[01:08:15.495 --> 01:08:17.077]  I mean, you're not supposed to touch anything.
[01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:18.899]  Remember when the shuttle crashed?
[01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:24.186]  They told you if you touched anything spread across Texas, you were going to get thrown in jail for the rest of your life?
[01:08:24.991 --> 01:08:30.333]  But up at the Pentagon, it was okay to go rounding around picking things up, and that didn't quite make any sense to me either.
[01:08:30.753 --> 01:08:34.274]  I understand we have Leah Lewis on the line from Austin, Texas.
[01:08:34.294 --> 01:08:38.276]  I want to go to Leah real quick because she has something she's got to say.
[01:08:38.316 --> 01:08:38.876]  Leah, are you there?
[01:08:38.896 --> 01:08:41.357]  Yeah, I've got something I've just got to say.
[01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:44.978]  Well, you know, you've got a pretty big mouth, and you're not afraid to use it.
[01:08:47.193 --> 01:08:48.715]  How do I take that, Bob?
[01:08:48.775 --> 01:08:50.636]  I've known Leah for many, many years.
[01:08:50.717 --> 01:08:55.661]  She is the friendliest patriot I've ever met.
[01:08:55.681 --> 01:08:57.423]  She's got the biggest smile and everything.
[01:08:57.443 --> 01:09:00.206]  She's kind of like a cheerleader for our guys.
[01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:01.467]  Leah, what's going on?
[01:09:01.507 --> 01:09:03.749]  Well, I appreciate that very much.
[01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:06.532]  Well, we're all filling our roles, aren't we?
[01:09:07.208 --> 01:09:08.529]  Yeah, what do you got?
[01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:10.670]  You're talking about some kind of an event or something?
[01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:13.291]  I have got a tiger by the tail here.
[01:09:13.311 --> 01:09:21.855]  This is just absolutely the best energy in the country right here in Austin, Texas today.
[01:09:22.455 --> 01:09:24.116]  This is September 11th.
[01:09:25.517 --> 01:09:32.180]  Five years ago was that tragic event that was a made-for-television movie.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.661]  That's how I look at it.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.021]  And this has drawn a lot of attention.
[01:09:38.321 --> 01:09:53.106]  We're holding the door open on this event, so people like my friend Sophia, otherwise known as Small Storm, can do magnificent creative pieces, as she has done.
[01:09:54.046 --> 01:10:02.369]  She has created a movie entitled 9-11 Mysteries Part 1 Demolition.
[01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:04.350]  And Sophia...
[01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:06.122]  Well, what's going on?
[01:10:06.142 --> 01:10:07.123]  It's at the Dobie Theater.
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.381]  At 7 p.m.
[01:10:32.501 --> 01:10:35.442]  for one showing only.
[01:10:35.462 --> 01:10:38.804]  Okay, that's 2025 Guadalupe Adobe Theater in the University of Texas area?
[01:10:38.864 --> 01:10:39.365]  Correct.
[01:10:39.965 --> 01:10:40.545]  One showing only?
[01:10:40.565 --> 01:10:41.866]  Correct, down in the UT area.
[01:10:42.086 --> 01:10:43.086]  It's on the drag.
[01:10:43.447 --> 01:10:48.809]  The parking is free in the Adobe garage if we can validate that parking ticket.
[01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.670]  And the tickets are what, $10?
[01:10:51.071 --> 01:10:50.670]  $10.
[01:10:51.311 --> 01:10:52.711]  And how do you get them?
[01:10:53.532 --> 01:10:57.494]  You can get them by going to Brave New Books,
[01:10:58.294 --> 01:11:04.257]  Which is that great new bookstore that just opened on the drag at MLK in Guadalupe.
[01:11:04.277 --> 01:11:04.638]  All right.
[01:11:05.698 --> 01:11:15.564]  And those guys down there are doing a terrific job of getting the word out and really, really promoting truth-based information.
[01:11:15.584 --> 01:11:16.664]  All right.
[01:11:16.725 --> 01:11:23.168]  So, yeah, Brave New Books is where you can get those tickets all day today, or you can buy them at the door.
[01:11:23.448 --> 01:11:28.071]  If you get there very early, or you can get advance tickets,
[01:11:28.556 --> 01:11:32.439]  With credit card by calling a particular phone number.
[01:11:32.739 --> 01:11:33.120]  Okay.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.541]  And you don't want me to give that one out?
[01:11:34.781 --> 01:11:35.582]  I'll give it out.
[01:11:35.642 --> 01:11:36.142]  You bet.
[01:11:36.162 --> 01:11:36.262]  512-291-2743.
[01:11:36.322 --> 01:11:36.723]  Okay.
[01:11:36.783 --> 01:11:37.203]  That's 512.
[01:11:37.763 --> 01:11:38.744]  That's Austin.
[01:11:38.764 --> 01:11:39.545]  Erica.
[01:11:39.765 --> 01:11:40.005]  Erica.
[01:11:40.025 --> 01:11:40.065]  512-291-2743.
[01:11:40.085 --> 01:11:42.067]  If you're interested in tickets to this evening's 7 p.m.
[01:11:42.087 --> 01:11:45.149]  showing of 9-1-1 Mysteries Part 1 Demolitions produced by Sophia Shawquat.
[01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.369]  Right?
[01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:59.054]  Yes, that is correct.
[01:11:59.394 --> 01:12:06.277]  Now, I have Sophia standing by, and I would just love for you to have a conversation with her.
[01:12:06.397 --> 01:12:07.737]  Well, put her on.
[01:12:08.097 --> 01:12:09.078]  Great, great.
[01:12:09.178 --> 01:12:09.978]  Thank you, Bob.
[01:12:10.038 --> 01:12:15.860]  Listen, you're a hero here locally, and I'm a fan.
[01:12:15.881 --> 01:12:17.341]  I'm just the only guy left behind.
[01:12:19.662 --> 01:12:21.143]  Gosh, I guess it's you and me, Bob.
[01:12:22.243 --> 01:12:28.004]  Anyway, you're very entertaining, and you're a great, great guy in my book.
[01:12:28.024 --> 01:12:29.725]  So thank you for everything you're doing.
[01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.925]  You're doing a wonderful job filling in for Alex.
[01:12:31.945 --> 01:12:32.765]  Well, thank you very much, Leah.
[01:12:32.785 --> 01:12:34.106]  That's a great compliment.
[01:12:34.286 --> 01:12:35.366]  Okay, well, I appreciate it.
[01:12:35.406 --> 01:12:36.466]  We'll put Sophia on.
[01:12:36.506 --> 01:12:46.348]  All right, you enjoy this small storm, because she is going to be making a lot of waves in this country for this movement.
[01:12:46.568 --> 01:12:46.768]  All right.
[01:12:46.828 --> 01:12:47.308]  All right.
[01:12:47.508 --> 01:12:48.069]  God bless.
[01:12:48.109 --> 01:12:48.429]  Thanks.
[01:12:48.469 --> 01:12:48.829]  Thank you.
[01:12:48.869 --> 01:12:49.429]  Here she is.
[01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:49.889]  Sophia, you there?
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.140]  Sophia, are you there?
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:53.280]  Yes, I am.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:58.661]  Yes, well, welcome to the Alex Jones Show worldwide with 17 billion people listening.
[01:12:58.701 --> 01:12:59.181]  How are you doing?
[01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.862]  I'm doing very well and I'm very honored.
[01:13:01.942 --> 01:13:03.582]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[01:13:03.602 --> 01:13:06.323]  And you put this film together when?
[01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:18.225]  The film is actually, it was an extension of the live show that Brad and I did in Hollywood last summer at the Met Theater, also called 9-11 Mysteries.
[01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:24.959]  And we had four parts, Demolition, Hijackers and Planes, War Games, Benefits.
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:31.645]  And there were so many requests for a DVD by people worldwide who couldn't come to L.A.
[01:13:31.705 --> 01:13:36.088]  that I undertook to make a video version of this.
[01:13:36.248 --> 01:13:42.973]  And that naturally, as all projects go, became something quite bigger, quite more spectacular, and very different.
[01:13:43.834 --> 01:13:49.058]  So I have, in staring at Demolition's evidence, you might call it, for the last
[01:13:49.654 --> 01:13:51.895]  So you're talking about hardcore evidence.
[01:14:13.823 --> 01:14:21.770]  Hardcore evidence, and not just hardcore evidence, an arrangement of that evidence that makes a whole new kind of sense.
[01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:26.694]  As you know, Bob, there were all sorts of explosions at the Twin Towers.
[01:14:26.834 --> 01:14:31.758]  And the public would come to me after the show and they would say, why do we have to hear so much about explosions?
[01:14:31.838 --> 01:14:36.061]  You know, explosions, explosions, all these different, we're tired of hearing about explosions, it's just too much.
[01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:39.004]  Tell us one or two explosions and that's enough, we get it.
[01:14:39.557 --> 01:14:40.698]  So I said this to Brad.
[01:14:40.718 --> 01:14:42.139]  I said, there are too many explosions.
[01:14:42.199 --> 01:14:45.341]  Brad, cut the piece down in the demolition section.
[01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:46.922]  And he said, no, no, no.
[01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:50.785]  These are all very valid, important kinds of explosions.
[01:14:51.045 --> 01:14:51.666]  More proof.
[01:14:51.726 --> 01:14:52.286]  More proof.
[01:14:52.426 --> 01:14:58.550]  So then it was his brainwave to arrange the explosions, to group them by their nature.
[01:14:59.071 --> 01:14:59.211]  The
[01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:03.094]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:15:03.474 --> 01:15:09.915]  As part of my payment for talking about this all over the world right now, you're going to have to give me one of those DVDs for free, okay?
[01:15:09.955 --> 01:15:10.636]  Oh, of course.
[01:15:10.956 --> 01:15:11.236]  Of course.
[01:15:11.256 --> 01:15:12.476]  That's part of the deal, okay?
[01:15:12.956 --> 01:15:13.596]  Yes.
[01:15:13.816 --> 01:15:14.597]  Because I want to see that.
[01:15:14.617 --> 01:15:20.298]  Because I am well-known in Austin, anyway, for really being a hardcore fact freak.
[01:15:21.013 --> 01:15:24.875]  You know, one explosion isn't enough because obviously there were more than one.
[01:15:25.135 --> 01:15:26.715]  And I would love to see that.
[01:15:26.815 --> 01:15:29.356]  And again, this is tonight, 7 p.m.
[01:15:29.616 --> 01:15:32.178]  at the Dobie Theater, 2025 Guadalupe.
[01:15:32.978 --> 01:15:43.122]  And once again, if you're in the Austin area, you can call 291-2743 with a credit card to get an advance ticket or go to Brave New Books at Martin Luther King in Guadalupe.
[01:15:43.862 --> 01:15:48.986]  To pick up tickets, or you can get them at the door tonight, 7 p.m.
[01:15:49.026 --> 01:15:49.767]  at the Dobie Theater.
[01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:54.150]  And, Sophia, I thank you very much, and I'll be expecting a copy of that DVD.
[01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:55.611]  We will get you one.
[01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:56.212]  Don't worry.
[01:15:56.472 --> 01:15:57.633]  Well, thank you very much for the call.
[01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:58.293]  I appreciate it.
[01:15:58.493 --> 01:15:58.773]  Bye.
[01:15:59.134 --> 01:15:59.714]  Okay.
[01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:00.895]  We've got a few minutes here.
[01:16:00.915 --> 01:16:03.237]  Let's go to Dave in Arizona.
[01:16:03.277 --> 01:16:04.438]  He's been holding quite some time.
[01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:05.198]  Dave, you still there?
[01:16:05.218 --> 01:16:05.258]  Hi.
[01:16:05.599 --> 01:16:06.059]  Good morning.
[01:16:06.079 --> 01:16:06.559]  Good morning.
[01:16:06.759 --> 01:16:07.380]  Good morning, Bob.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.401]  How are you doing?
[01:16:09.141 --> 01:16:10.202]  I'm doing okay.
[01:16:10.302 --> 01:16:12.424]  I wanted to give you a little bit of...
[01:16:13.768 --> 01:16:14.689]  Encouraging news.
[01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:18.072]  By the way, you're a good substitute for Alex.
[01:16:18.112 --> 01:16:18.973]  You made a good choice.
[01:16:19.053 --> 01:16:19.493]  Well, thank you.
[01:16:19.513 --> 01:16:21.715]  I'm getting paid humongous amounts of money to do this.
[01:16:21.775 --> 01:16:23.276]  I just want you to know that.
[01:16:23.296 --> 01:16:24.097]  We don't believe that.
[01:16:24.637 --> 01:16:27.600]  Yeah, you better not believe it.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.464]  I had an opportunity to get on air this morning with Air America.
[01:16:32.504 --> 01:16:33.244]  You're familiar with them.
[01:16:33.284 --> 01:16:34.666]  They have an affiliate here in Phoenix.
[01:16:36.407 --> 01:16:39.790]  And it appears the tide is turning, Bob.
[01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:41.031]  The entire...
[01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:55.986]  Two hours of their program was devoted exclusively to callers on about 9-1-1, and there was only about one call out of at least a dozen that was in denial, and he sounded like a CIA spook to me.
[01:16:56.843 --> 01:17:05.171]  You know, he just said that the 9-11 Commission had all the subpoena power and if there was any evidence of a cover-up, they would have discovered that and blah, blah.
[01:17:05.391 --> 01:17:13.619]  Some people, if you were to hit them over the head with a 2x4 and videotape it and play it back to them, they would deny the reality of it.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.901]  Some people are that dense.
[01:17:16.522 --> 01:17:20.466]  Well, you know, Bob, I'm really convinced personally that there is...
[01:17:21.061 --> 01:17:29.108]  There is a mind control technique being used on television that are very insidious that we may not even be aware of yet.
[01:17:29.148 --> 01:17:44.040]  We know about mind control and MKUltra and Project Orion, but I believe personally that the primary reason that the majority of the American people are dumber than a box of rocks is because they're being brainwashed by television.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:50.785]  You can, TPS can kidnap their kids, the government can steal everything they have, the criminals in government
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.202]  If you come to take their remote control, they're ready to fight you for it.
[01:17:54.822 --> 01:17:56.624]  Well, that's absolutely true.
[01:17:56.664 --> 01:17:58.105]  Dave, thank you very much for the call.
[01:17:58.125 --> 01:17:58.785]  I appreciate it.
[01:17:58.805 --> 01:18:02.848]  I have to echo what he said there.
[01:18:03.368 --> 01:18:13.115]  I think that the propaganda that you get while watching television is so dense that you can't even see it.
[01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:16.157]  But if you turn on television right now, especially the Fox News channel,
[01:18:17.003 --> 01:18:18.084]  Watch the background.
[01:18:18.324 --> 01:18:19.065]  Watch the noise.
[01:18:19.145 --> 01:18:19.946]  Watch the glitter.
[01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:23.689]  Watch what they do when someone brings up a good point that they don't want to talk about.
[01:18:24.269 --> 01:18:27.712]  It is a gigantic propaganda machine.
[01:18:28.353 --> 01:18:31.776]  And I quite frankly don't see how more people don't see through it.
[01:18:31.856 --> 01:18:34.198]  But the good news is more people are seeing through it.
[01:18:34.218 --> 01:18:38.122]  And I think Dave from Arizona is right.
[01:18:38.162 --> 01:18:39.503]  I think the tide is turning.
[01:18:40.804 --> 01:18:41.905]  We'll be back after the break.
[01:18:44.462 --> 01:18:44.782]  We're good to go.
[01:18:53.277 --> 01:18:54.037]  Terrorism.
[01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:54.938]  Terrorism.
[01:18:55.038 --> 01:18:55.878]  Chemical attacks.
[01:18:55.938 --> 01:18:56.618]  Dirty bombs.
[01:18:56.718 --> 01:18:57.118]  Fallout.
[01:18:57.198 --> 01:18:58.199]  Biological attack.
[01:18:58.379 --> 01:18:58.919]  And threats.
[01:18:58.999 --> 01:19:01.099]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:19:01.359 --> 01:19:02.960]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.681]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:19:06.061 --> 01:19:20.625]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:20.665 --> 01:19:20.985]  government.
[01:19:21.165 --> 01:19:22.966]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:29.247]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:29.367 --> 01:19:33.888]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:19:34.128 --> 01:19:40.850]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:43.550]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:19:52.805 --> 01:19:54.906]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:54.986 --> 01:19:56.947]  Today is September 8th, 2006.
[01:19:58.248 --> 01:20:03.310]  Gold opened at $6.10 an ounce and gold coins can be purchased at $6.39.73.
[01:20:03.951 --> 01:20:07.553]  Again, that's $6.39.73 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:20:08.413 --> 01:20:13.856]  Foreign countries have had a significant impact on the price of gold and the demand continues to be strong.
[01:20:14.585 --> 01:20:20.112]  Summertime has a tendency to slow down trading in the physical markets, and there are many bargains to be found.
[01:20:20.593 --> 01:20:24.518]  With fall weather and kids back to school, these opportunities tend to dry up quickly.
[01:20:25.206 --> 01:20:29.668]  If you are a bargain hunter and would like to take advantage of these offers, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:31.128 --> 01:20:34.530]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:40.092]  I would also like to mention our free report regarding government rules and trading gold privately.
[01:20:40.552 --> 01:20:41.532]  Call for that report.
[01:20:41.612 --> 01:20:42.113]  It's free.
[01:20:42.133 --> 01:20:42.313]  800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.373 --> 01:20:42.553]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.968 --> 01:20:57.250]  Do you remember when you could eat most anything and not worry about it?
[01:20:57.730 --> 01:20:59.892]  Or maybe weight management has always been a problem.
[01:21:00.412 --> 01:21:05.776]  Are you frustrated, burned out, and tired of fad diets and marketing gimmicks that don't really work?
[01:21:06.316 --> 01:21:12.180]  Do you want a proven system, a long-term solution to live a healthier lifestyle and properly manage your weight?
[01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:16.034]  At WeCanTogether.com, our approach is different.

[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.863]  Individual needs and personal goals.
[01:21:24.423 --> 01:21:26.626]  Not the cookie cutter approach offered by others.

[01:21:53.015 --> 01:21:55.377]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.457 --> 01:22:05.945]  Did you know the President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled the United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:11.229]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations organization.
[01:22:11.949 --> 01:22:16.413]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[01:22:17.095 --> 01:22:22.777]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[01:22:23.567 --> 01:22:31.552]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:53.079 --> 01:22:59.186]  Well, I won't back down No, I won't back down
[01:23:09.796 --> 01:23:16.940]  You can stand me up at the gates of hell, but I won't back down.
[01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.101]  All right.
[01:23:18.121 --> 01:23:19.021]  That's right.
[01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:20.722]  We're not going to back down.
[01:23:20.742 --> 01:23:23.083]  We are going to stand our ground, because guess what?
[01:23:23.143 --> 01:23:24.144]  We don't have any choice.
[01:23:24.544 --> 01:23:27.605]  This is the United States of America, and we want to keep it that way.
[01:23:27.966 --> 01:23:28.986]  My name is Bob Dacey.
[01:23:29.026 --> 01:23:36.930]  I'm substituting for Alex Jones here on this fifth anniversary of the mass murder of 3,000 people on September 11, 2001.
[01:23:38.951 --> 01:23:39.051]  Bob.
[01:23:39.091 --> 01:23:39.491]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:39.551 --> 01:23:41.632]  Well, I have a few things.
[01:23:41.672 --> 01:23:42.192]  Number one...
[01:24:09.361 --> 01:24:27.607]  I've recently, in the past couple of days, been doing my own research on Building 7, and I believe that Building 7 and Flight 93, they crashed, or was reported to have crashed, are quite possibly the biggest smoking guns that we have available to us.
[01:24:28.953 --> 01:24:32.995]  Now, for Building 7, it's quite obvious as to why.
[01:24:33.256 --> 01:24:35.877]  We've covered Building 7 pretty well so far.
[01:24:35.897 --> 01:24:39.999]  Tell me, what do you think about Flight 93 makes it a smoking gun of 9-1-1?
[01:24:40.099 --> 01:24:52.545]  Okay, Flight 93, we're told that the plane essentially crashed from the passengers struggling with control with the terrorists who took the plane over.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:25:07.752]  Other than the fact that NORAD didn't scramble, as they should have, the thing that's really, really odd about this is that the debris of the plane was scattered for miles, for over 11 miles.
[01:25:09.099 --> 01:25:10.321]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[01:25:10.401 --> 01:25:11.442]  Ken, thank you for the call.
[01:25:11.542 --> 01:25:13.565]  I'm going to continue on with your points there.
[01:25:13.585 --> 01:25:16.929]  Okay, so he's talking about Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania.
[01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:19.753]  Very strange things about that flight.
[01:25:19.793 --> 01:25:23.998]  Yeah, eyewitnesses saw it trailing smoke.
[01:25:24.999 --> 01:25:25.179]  Okay.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:32.922]  And yes, there was a debris field, small pieces of debris, as far as eight miles away from the crash site.
[01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:37.884]  And if I'm not mistaken, I believe one of the engines was found over a mile away.
[01:25:38.564 --> 01:25:48.768]  Of course, none of that is consistent with a great struggle where the crazy Arabs nosedived the plane into the ground while the valiant passengers were trying to pull the stick back up again, you know?
[01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:53.547]  That's another part of 9-1-1 that just doesn't quite make sense.
[01:25:54.369 --> 01:26:00.281]  Again, the hole in the ground there, I mean, it's just a hole.
[01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:04.531]  You know, and maybe that's what happens to a plane when it hits the ground.
[01:26:04.551 --> 01:26:05.911]  Maybe it just turns into a hole.
[01:26:05.931 --> 01:26:06.451]  I don't know.
[01:26:07.052 --> 01:26:13.913]  But there's something wrong with the Flight 93 scenario, too, because all evidence is that it was shot down.
[01:26:14.053 --> 01:26:18.594]  And, of course, if it was shot down, that would have been the proper thing to do, unfortunately, I guess.
[01:26:19.515 --> 01:26:23.456]  But, you know, they can't even get that straight.
[01:26:23.516 --> 01:26:26.857]  Okay, up next we have Dan in Montreal, Canada.
[01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:28.437]  Dan, are you still there?
[01:26:29.452 --> 01:26:29.892]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:29.932 --> 01:26:30.313]  How's it going?
[01:26:30.553 --> 01:26:31.093]  Pretty good.
[01:26:31.133 --> 01:26:33.014]  What do you Canucks think about all of this?
[01:26:34.095 --> 01:26:35.696]  Well, I have two things I'd like to say.
[01:26:36.156 --> 01:26:43.880]  First of all, my favorite smoking gun would have to be Secretary of Transportation John Mineta's testimony to the United Weather Commission.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:45.821]  That's Norman Mineta, but yeah.
[01:26:45.961 --> 01:26:48.303]  Sorry about that.
[01:26:48.423 --> 01:26:55.847]  Where he reports of a young man going up to Cheney at regular intervals and telling him, you know, the plane's 70 miles out, 50, 40, 30, 10.
[01:26:58.345 --> 01:27:01.767]  Well, you know, that is a really good smoking gun of 9-1-1.
[01:27:01.867 --> 01:27:03.688]  Let's discuss that.
[01:27:03.708 --> 01:27:08.432]  You've got the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta,
[01:27:27.559 --> 01:27:29.741]  Testifying before the 911 Commission.
[01:27:29.801 --> 01:27:32.884]  The see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil monkey.
[01:27:33.885 --> 01:27:35.687]  And you can actually see that video.
[01:27:35.707 --> 01:27:37.468]  He sits there and he talks about this guy.
[01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:41.112]  This young officer asking Dick Cheney.
[01:27:41.352 --> 01:27:42.953]  Cheney's in the bunker running everything.
[01:27:43.474 --> 01:27:43.734]  He says,
[01:27:44.284 --> 01:27:46.265]  And here's this plane coming into the Pentagon.
[01:27:46.385 --> 01:27:50.507]  This is the one that was coming into the Pentagon, and he's saying, oh, okay, it's 10 miles out.
[01:27:50.967 --> 01:27:54.169]  The order's still standing, and Cheney whirls on him and says, of course they stand.
[01:27:54.209 --> 01:27:55.409]  Have you heard anything any different?
[01:27:55.870 --> 01:28:00.232]  Now, the question there is, now, you could make up a scenario where that's a totally innocent comment, right?
[01:28:00.712 --> 01:28:11.777]  What I want to know is why they haven't gotten that young officer and put him under oath and put a bunch of lights on him and say, hey, buddy, exactly what was the content of that conversation?
[01:28:11.817 --> 01:28:12.938]  Because that hasn't happened.
[01:28:13.618 --> 01:28:16.541]  You know, but that is a good smoking gun, a 9-1-1.
[01:28:16.741 --> 01:28:23.988]  And, of course, the fact that they're not interested in this officer and his eyewitness account stinks to high heaven.
[01:28:24.829 --> 01:28:26.891]  All right, we're going to be back after the break.
[01:28:27.352 --> 01:28:29.974]  I believe Alex Jones is going to be up here with us in a little bit.
[01:28:30.715 --> 01:28:33.178]  Alex Jones Show, 1-800-259-9231 on the Genesis Communications Network.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.241]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.721 --> 01:28:46.342]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.242 --> 01:28:50.023]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.785 --> 01:28:56.287]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:56.387 --> 01:28:58.768]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[01:28:58.828 --> 01:29:05.011]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[01:29:06.492 --> 01:29:08.673]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:29:09.432 --> 01:29:10.993]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[01:29:39.461 --> 01:29:39.741]  U.S.
[01:29:39.821 --> 01:29:42.723]  debt bubble, red alert, and real estate crash.
[01:29:43.703 --> 01:29:46.004]  Call 888-8-XANADU.
[01:29:46.044 --> 01:29:50.246]  That's 888-8-X-A-N-A-D-U.
[01:29:50.566 --> 01:29:51.567]  And ask for George.
[01:29:54.308 --> 01:29:55.349]  The war on terrorism.
[01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:58.450]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:29:58.730 --> 01:30:02.872]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:30:03.312 --> 01:30:04.133]  So what do you do?
[01:30:04.453 --> 01:30:09.015]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:30:09.502 --> 01:30:11.623]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:30:12.124 --> 01:30:26.813]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:30:26.853 --> 01:30:33.977]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:30:34.277 --> 01:30:37.439]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.281]  By now, it is no surprise that the U.S.
[01:30:41.301 --> 01:30:45.842]  ranks 37th in the world in occurrence of chronic illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:30:45.882 --> 01:30:50.324]  Due to modern farming and food processing practices, our food supply has become nutrition
[01:31:09.735 --> 01:31:10.075]  We're good to go.
[01:31:39.735 --> 01:31:40.355]  We're good to go.
[01:32:06.918 --> 01:32:09.079]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:09.099 --> 01:32:18.001]  This is Bob Dacey, host of the Simple Truth TV show in Austin, Texas, substituting for Alex Jones while he's up in New York, giving him what fur.
[01:32:18.642 --> 01:32:25.183]  We're talking about the smoking guns of 9-1-1, and our next caller up is Dan from Texas.
[01:32:25.223 --> 01:32:25.884]  Dan, are you there?
[01:32:25.904 --> 01:32:27.064]  Yes, Bob.
[01:32:28.439 --> 01:32:52.481]  One thing I just wanted to throw into the fray is in conjunction with William Rodriguez and other witnesses' statements regarding the explosions prior to the towers being struck, and then of course at the time the towers collapsed, it's I think pretty well known
[01:32:54.046 --> 01:33:11.240]  Just prior to the collapse of the towers, the Geophysical Monitoring Center at Columbia University measured tremors at 2.3 and 2.1 on the Richter scale.
[01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:21.989]  But another thing that isn't, I think, so widely discussed is earlier, just prior to the planes striking the towers,
[01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:27.012]  There were readings at that geophysical center.
[01:33:27.952 --> 01:33:28.913]  Tremors of 0.9 and 0.7.
[01:33:28.973 --> 01:33:34.675]  The 0.9 was registered 14 seconds before the first tower was struck.
[01:33:34.955 --> 01:33:36.396]  The 0.7 tremor was registered
[01:33:46.789 --> 01:33:50.152]  Now, let's make, understand, let's get people clear of what that means.
[01:33:50.212 --> 01:33:53.436]  That means that the, what it was picking up wasn't the planes.
[01:34:04.187 --> 01:34:06.768]  It was not the planes.
[01:34:06.908 --> 01:34:13.230]  The seismic activity began before the planes struck the towers.
[01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:14.271]  That's the bottom line.
[01:34:14.531 --> 01:34:21.674]  You've got NORAD and the FAA and everybody and his brother and the Palisade Seismic Facility there in New York.
[01:34:21.694 --> 01:34:23.234]  They all go on the atomic clock.
[01:34:23.254 --> 01:34:25.155]  WT, you know, UTC.
[01:34:25.995 --> 01:34:26.956]  Universal Time Clock.
[01:34:26.976 --> 01:34:28.256]  They all go on the same clock.
[01:34:28.576 --> 01:34:30.437]  The same clock they run this show off of.
[01:34:30.597 --> 01:34:33.258]  Everybody goes on this Universal Time Clock.
[01:34:33.858 --> 01:34:45.982]  But according to the 9-1-1 Commission, the planes hit the towers at a different time than the seismic activity, and in each case, after the seismic activity began.
[01:34:46.302 --> 01:34:47.043]  That is correct.
[01:34:47.263 --> 01:34:51.004]  In the first instance, it was 14 seconds difference.
[01:34:51.104 --> 01:34:51.404]  Right.
[01:34:51.624 --> 01:34:53.385]  And the second one was 17 seconds difference.
[01:34:53.425 --> 01:34:55.085]  That's absolutely true.
[01:34:55.345 --> 01:34:56.066]  Absolutely correct.
[01:34:56.086 --> 01:34:57.326]  Dan, thank you for the call.
[01:34:57.486 --> 01:34:59.607]  I appreciate that, because that was another...
[01:35:00.499 --> 01:35:04.622]  Of one of the monstrous smoking guns of 9-1-1.
[01:35:05.302 --> 01:35:07.884]  And again, no conspiracy theory at all.
[01:35:08.744 --> 01:35:14.068]  How can the seismic activity begin before the planes hit the towers?
[01:35:14.328 --> 01:35:26.596]  That totally and completely corroborates William Rodriguez who said that the first explosion came from underneath his feet and the second impact came from way up above several seconds later.
[01:35:27.076 --> 01:35:28.197]  That totally corroborates
[01:35:28.542 --> 01:35:29.222]  Hi there.
[01:35:29.282 --> 01:35:30.943]  This is the first time I've heard you.
[01:35:30.963 --> 01:35:33.123]  How are you spelling your last name?
[01:35:33.223 --> 01:35:33.744]  Is it G-A-C-Y?
[01:35:33.764 --> 01:35:34.064]  No, it's D-A-C-Y.
[01:35:34.084 --> 01:35:34.224]  D-A-C-Y.
[01:35:34.244 --> 01:35:34.324]  Okay.
[01:35:34.344 --> 01:35:34.684]  Very good.
[01:35:34.704 --> 01:35:40.826]  I like what you said when you were talking about the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:35:58.519 --> 01:35:59.860]  That you mentioned them.
[01:36:00.501 --> 01:36:09.047]  And I wanted to mention also that there is an excellent book, which I'm not sure if you've heard of, of course, by the name of En Route to Global Occupation.
[01:36:09.067 --> 01:36:10.468]  I haven't heard of that one.
[01:36:10.488 --> 01:36:11.129]  Who wrote that one?
[01:36:11.469 --> 01:36:14.171]  Okay, it's a guy by the name of Gary Ka.
[01:36:14.792 --> 01:36:18.875]  And again, the title is En Route to Global Occupation.
[01:36:19.335 --> 01:36:23.419]  The first word, en, is E-N as opposed to I-N.
[01:36:24.272 --> 01:36:24.472]  Yeah.
[01:36:24.572 --> 01:36:26.013]  And he talks about the CFR.
[01:36:26.093 --> 01:36:28.413]  It's an excellent book that everybody should read.
[01:36:28.793 --> 01:36:35.435]  It's out of print, unfortunately, at the time, but you can probably get a copy of it at the library.
[01:36:35.515 --> 01:36:40.156]  Well, Steve, what is your favorite smoking gun of 9-1-1 that we haven't talked about today?
[01:36:40.316 --> 01:36:41.917]  You have a particular favorite?
[01:36:42.857 --> 01:36:48.619]  Yes, actually, that the aircraft, the 757 and 767-type aircraft, are able to be flown remotely controlled.
[01:36:53.447 --> 01:36:57.289]  Yeah, that is actually, and I appreciate your call, Steve.
[01:36:57.309 --> 01:36:57.930]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:01.432]  That is actually old technology.
[01:37:02.672 --> 01:37:06.754]  Flying a big aircraft like that is old technology.
[01:37:06.774 --> 01:37:08.335]  They've been able to do that for years.
[01:37:09.096 --> 01:37:13.678]  And, of course, you know, that goes into the realm of the theoretical.
[01:37:14.279 --> 01:37:18.141]  However, and I don't like to deal too much in the theoretical.
[01:37:18.181 --> 01:37:19.982]  I like to deal in the concrete mostly.
[01:37:20.869 --> 01:37:35.795]  But it does seem like that you would not want to rely on a bunch of nervous hijackers who are fixing to kill themselves to actually pull it off.
[01:37:35.855 --> 01:37:49.681]  I mean, to actually go through the airports, go through security, keep their little box cutters hidden, actually be able to fight off everybody in the plane, actually be able to defeat these ex-military guys who are now commercial pilots.
[01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:58.093]  To then fly a plane and to navigate a plane into their targets, that sounds like a stupid plan.
[01:37:58.313 --> 01:38:00.434]  It really does sound like a stupid plan.
[01:38:00.854 --> 01:38:16.000]  But if you believe the conventional wisdom about September 11th, that's exactly what the evil genius Osama bin Laden planned to do, was have a bunch of idiots fly planes across the country without any training that couldn't even fly a Cessna,
[01:38:18.366 --> 01:38:26.227]  To take control of 757, 767 and fly them across the country and bullseye them right where they're supposed to go.
[01:38:27.288 --> 01:38:30.828]  That's a theory that they were remote controlled into the towers.
[01:38:31.208 --> 01:38:37.269]  However, I think it is the best theory available because it makes the most tactical sense.
[01:38:37.909 --> 01:38:40.070]  Alright, well thank you very much for that call.
[01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:44.331]  Next up we have Marilee in Texas.
[01:38:44.391 --> 01:38:46.791]  Marilee, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:38:47.648 --> 01:38:49.148]  Hey, Bob.
[01:38:49.769 --> 01:38:51.009]  I'm one of your fans.
[01:38:51.869 --> 01:38:53.870]  Well, that's two now.
[01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:57.011]  I got Leah and you.
[01:38:57.071 --> 01:38:57.451]  That's good.
[01:38:57.511 --> 01:38:58.051]  That's two.
[01:38:58.191 --> 01:39:01.532]  I call your store every now and then and talk to you.
[01:39:01.672 --> 01:39:02.412]  Yeah, I know who you are.
[01:39:02.572 --> 01:39:03.052]  Yeah.
[01:39:03.532 --> 01:39:08.034]  Okay, well, anyway, you had a caller on earlier.
[01:39:08.154 --> 01:39:12.755]  I think his name was Mark, and he had a great smoking gun.
[01:39:13.759 --> 01:39:15.760]  And let me turn my computer on.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:17.381]  I don't remember which smoking gun he had.
[01:39:17.421 --> 01:39:19.202]  That was a lot of smoking guns ago.
[01:39:19.922 --> 01:39:21.003]  That's the whole point.
[01:39:21.083 --> 01:39:23.244]  You've got some smoking guns in your store.
[01:39:23.304 --> 01:39:25.185]  But anyway, I was just joking.
[01:39:25.285 --> 01:39:25.725]  That's true.
[01:39:25.745 --> 01:39:26.505]  I sell firearms.
[01:39:27.406 --> 01:39:29.207]  But hey, let me tell you something.
[01:39:29.367 --> 01:39:30.107]  You brought that up.
[01:39:30.147 --> 01:39:31.208]  Let me change the subject for a second.
[01:39:31.308 --> 01:39:34.069]  I do sell firearms in my hardware store.
[01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:37.511]  But I only sell the evil firearms.
[01:39:37.992 --> 01:39:40.553]  I don't sell the good firearms.
[01:39:40.693 --> 01:39:41.534]  Just evil ones.
[01:39:41.574 --> 01:39:49.880]  Because if you look at the United Nations definition of evil firearm, that's defined as a firearm not in the hands of government.
[01:39:50.741 --> 01:39:53.202]  And so I only sell firearms to civilians.
[01:39:53.262 --> 01:39:58.506]  Therefore, under the United Nations definition, I only sell evil firearms.
[01:39:58.826 --> 01:39:59.787]  Now go ahead, Marilee.
[01:39:59.807 --> 01:40:00.848]  What were you having to say about...
[01:40:01.517 --> 01:40:06.399]  A caller named Mark, who was an airline pilot, was on.
[01:40:06.579 --> 01:40:10.560]  And he said that his boss called him in the office.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.061]  He was questioning him.
[01:40:13.101 --> 01:40:14.561]  And he said, yeah.
[01:40:15.362 --> 01:40:16.262]  He said, sit down.
[01:40:16.282 --> 01:40:19.123]  I'm the one that flew around the country.
[01:40:19.815 --> 01:40:21.816]  And picked up the Bin Laden family.
[01:40:21.836 --> 01:40:23.836]  Well, Marilee, you have to understand.
[01:40:24.096 --> 01:40:25.217]  You have to understand.
[01:40:25.937 --> 01:40:32.719]  When the evil genius Osama Bin Laden, who has many of his family members here in the United States, that's a big, big family.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:46.484]  When he is immediately accused of the heinous crime, the logical thing to do is to make sure that all the members of his family get the heck out of Dodge before anybody can question him.
[01:40:46.524 --> 01:40:48.605]  I mean, that makes total sense, doesn't it?
[01:40:48.645 --> 01:40:48.825]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:49.525 --> 01:40:54.768]  That you want to make sure that none of his family members can be questioned about the attack.
[01:40:55.068 --> 01:40:59.650]  So you round them all up when Americans can't fly, and you get them the heck out of the country.
[01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:03.772]  Another smoking gun of 911.
[01:41:04.373 --> 01:41:10.636]  Bob, my point is, that guy needs to be interviewed.
[01:41:11.883 --> 01:41:23.789]  Yeah, yeah, I guess so, but all we know is who he was and where he came from, and if he wants to be interviewed, I guess he can, if he's still listening, he can go find, he knows how to get a hold of Alex Jones.
[01:41:23.849 --> 01:41:25.330]  Everybody knows how to get a hold of Alex Jones.
[01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:27.170]  He can get a hold of me, get a hold of anybody.
[01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:28.071]  It's not hard to do.
[01:41:28.851 --> 01:41:30.352]  Yeah, well, I just thought.
[01:41:31.331 --> 01:41:31.751]  Wow.
[01:41:31.811 --> 01:41:34.733]  We could get somebody like that on.
[01:41:34.773 --> 01:41:36.253]  Yeah, well, that is a good point.
[01:41:36.273 --> 01:41:46.758]  There's a lot of people with a lot of expertise that have come forward with anecdotes about what was going on on September 11th that they had something to do with.
[01:41:46.838 --> 01:41:54.282]  So, Mary Lee, listen, I appreciate the call, and we'll let you go, and we're going to go to Jim in Los Angeles right now.
[01:41:54.342 --> 01:41:55.682]  Jim, you've been holding for a while.
[01:41:56.102 --> 01:41:57.383]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:58.345 --> 01:41:58.725]  Thanks, Bob.
[01:41:58.765 --> 01:41:59.506]  How are you doing today?
[01:41:59.806 --> 01:42:02.989]  Well, I'm doing all right, considering I've never done this before.
[01:42:03.009 --> 01:42:11.395]  This is the first for me, sitting here in the Central Texas Command Center, whatever Alex Jones calls this place.
[01:42:12.977 --> 01:42:14.338]  It's quite an experience for me.
[01:42:14.838 --> 01:42:16.840]  Well, you're doing a pretty good job for the first time.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:17.520]  Well, thank you.
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:18.861]  Beginner's luck.
[01:42:19.602 --> 01:42:22.204]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:42:22.384 --> 01:42:24.526]  I've got three smoking guns, actually.
[01:42:24.786 --> 01:42:25.507]  The first one is...
[01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:32.039]  The extra unit on the second plane that hit the Twin Towers, it looked like there was something on the underbelly.
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:36.363]  And the lack of dead bodies in D.C.
[01:42:36.423 --> 01:42:38.305]  and Pennsylvania Lodge, too.
[01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:40.527]  What was it called?
[01:42:40.547 --> 01:42:42.569]  The lack of dead bodies in D.C.
[01:42:42.609 --> 01:42:43.070]  and then what?
[01:42:44.071 --> 01:42:46.053]  In Pennsylvania.
[01:42:46.453 --> 01:42:49.877]  If you look at the footage, I don't see any dead bodies, I don't see any
[01:42:50.273 --> 01:42:52.397]  Wings, just small little bits of it.
[01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:52.838]  All right.
[01:42:52.918 --> 01:42:54.220]  Well, Jim, thank you for the call.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.925]  I want to discuss that just briefly before we go to Alex.
[01:42:57.005 --> 01:42:59.309]  Alex Jones is waiting in the wings, and he's not going to wait long.
[01:43:00.359 --> 01:43:07.425]  I personally don't subscribe to the pod theory because I've seen other evidence that says it's not true.
[01:43:07.965 --> 01:43:13.710]  I stay away from that one because it's not corroboratable like the other stuff.
[01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:17.053]  So the pod theory, I'm afraid I don't agree with you on that one.
[01:43:17.193 --> 01:43:21.276]  I think it's not true and I can probably prove it.
[01:43:21.357 --> 01:43:24.559]  But at any rate, I think Alex Jones is on the line.
[01:43:24.659 --> 01:43:25.280]  Alex, are you there?
[01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:27.782]  Bob, yes, I'm here.
[01:43:27.802 --> 01:43:28.503]  Can you hear me?
[01:43:28.663 --> 01:43:29.143]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:29.203 --> 01:43:30.424]  I can hear you loud and clear.
[01:43:30.444 --> 01:43:31.926]  Commander, what's going on up there?
[01:43:32.266 --> 01:43:32.646]  Where are you?
[01:43:32.686 --> 01:43:33.667]  Well, I'm at ground zero.
[01:43:33.727 --> 01:43:42.475]  I was unable to come on at the start of the program like I had originally planned because they had me lead a march of over a thousand people in black t-shirts saying, investigate 9-11.
[01:43:43.155 --> 01:43:45.657]  You can hear some of the big bells going off.
[01:43:45.698 --> 01:43:50.602]  They told it each time they read out a new name.
[01:43:51.297 --> 01:43:59.400]  What I'm going to do, Bob, is I'm supposed to be on the loudspeaker system they've got a permit for, right in front of Ground Zero, in about 20 minutes.
[01:44:00.941 --> 01:44:09.444]  And so I'm going to have them dial in with the cell phone so I can give a speech there, not just in front of Ground Zero, but over the air.
[01:44:09.464 --> 01:44:20.369]  And tomorrow, I've got about 30 minutes of the show, I'm going to call from a good hotel phone line to give everybody a detailed report of what's happened, but
[01:44:21.348 --> 01:44:22.990]  The entire atmosphere changed here.
[01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:27.514]  Two years ago when I was here, maybe 20-30% of the police would nod and smile and agree with us.
[01:44:28.035 --> 01:44:29.256]  I've had police captains.
[01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:31.118]  I've had them say, good job, keep it up.
[01:44:31.638 --> 01:44:37.384]  I've had, I would say about 60% of the police that are on our side and know all about 9-11.
[01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:38.344]  They know my name.
[01:44:38.865 --> 01:44:40.727]  Low-level police when I'm all over the city.
[01:44:41.514 --> 01:44:44.515]  High-level police who walk up and say, hey, keep investigating.
[01:44:45.115 --> 01:44:45.555]  Good job.
[01:44:45.615 --> 01:44:47.575]  Hey, Alex, keep up the good work.
[01:44:47.875 --> 01:44:48.775]  So that's another indicator.
[01:44:48.835 --> 01:44:57.737]  The firemen we've been talking to, 100% are on our side and have seen the documentary films, have seen Road Attorney, Martial Law, Loose Change.
[01:44:58.037 --> 01:44:59.797]  We've already seen Terror Storm online.
[01:45:01.318 --> 01:45:04.238]  It is just incredible what's happened at the grassroots.
[01:45:04.938 --> 01:45:08.359]  And I'm here at Ground Zero right now.
[01:45:08.379 --> 01:45:09.319]  All I can say is,
[01:45:10.191 --> 01:45:11.292]  It is amazing what's happening.
[01:45:11.312 --> 01:45:13.933]  And right down the street is Brown Brother Harriman, the big Nazi U.S.
[01:45:13.973 --> 01:45:14.193]  bank.
[01:45:14.693 --> 01:45:16.895]  The Bushes were on the court of.
[01:45:17.615 --> 01:45:24.278]  We're here in this center of evil with all these great people of New York who are waking up to what's happening, waking up to the truth.
[01:45:25.199 --> 01:45:30.862]  And I would have to say that there are probably 2,000 9-11 prisoners down here at any one time.
[01:45:30.882 --> 01:45:31.522]  About 1,000-plus marched with us.
[01:45:35.313 --> 01:45:40.377]  It's probably more than that, but then there was another 500 across the street, a couple hundred dispersed in other areas.
[01:45:42.699 --> 01:45:47.363]  We had a march without a permit because the police were so much on our side in New York's total police state.
[01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:49.945]  In the past, you couldn't even yell without a permit.
[01:45:50.962 --> 01:46:09.827]  So we had motorcycles and police guiding our march through Ground Zero, in front of it, and then back, and the line was so long that we walked three full, long city blocks, turned back around and marched the other way, and like a snake eating itself, reached the end when we got back to the park.
[01:46:10.367 --> 01:46:12.447]  So I'd just say a thousand, I had no idea.
[01:46:12.867 --> 01:46:18.989]  It was three or four people across for something like a half mile.
[01:46:19.938 --> 01:46:21.259]  So somebody can do the math on.
[01:46:21.279 --> 01:46:24.081]  Somebody can do the math on.
[01:46:24.841 --> 01:46:26.783]  But as you can tell, it's really noisy here.
[01:46:26.803 --> 01:46:27.523]  A lot of music.
[01:46:28.464 --> 01:46:29.264]  A lot of people.
[01:46:30.345 --> 01:46:31.346]  A lot of things happening.
[01:46:32.547 --> 01:46:38.370]  But we're here right now in front of the Millennium Hilton.
[01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:40.972]  And it's just unbelievable to see this.
[01:46:41.212 --> 01:46:42.813]  To see how far we've come.
[01:46:43.334 --> 01:46:47.236]  We've gone from the police being very mean, very irritable, and yelling at us.
[01:46:47.316 --> 01:46:49.518]  Even some of the firemen two years ago here at Ground Zero.
[01:46:50.489 --> 01:47:07.653]  To the majority of the police, almost all the firemen, agreeing with us and smiling at us and telling us good job, and doing things like flipping off a few, quote, debunkers, the provocateurs that are out here spewing their disinformation.
[01:47:07.673 --> 01:47:09.073]  There ought to be about 15 of them here.
[01:47:09.753 --> 01:47:11.754]  So there's thousands of us and about 15 of them, Bob.
[01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:14.274]  Well, you know, that's excellent.
[01:47:14.334 --> 01:47:15.595]  It's working, isn't it, Alex?
[01:47:15.635 --> 01:47:18.016]  The information war seems like we're starting to win it.
[01:47:18.917 --> 01:47:20.518]  First, you have to know who the enemy is.
[01:47:20.538 --> 01:47:21.619]  You have to be highly motivated.
[01:47:21.639 --> 01:47:22.560]  You have to keep fighting.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:24.622]  Never listen to their propaganda that we can't win.
[01:47:24.642 --> 01:47:26.163]  We are going to win.
[01:47:26.183 --> 01:47:27.724]  We are winning.
[01:47:27.764 --> 01:47:28.545]  We have won.
[01:47:28.565 --> 01:47:32.768]  The globalists are just now starting to figure that out, just starting to realize that.
[01:47:32.788 --> 01:47:40.534]  I'm going to get set up for the speech I'm supposed to give here in front of Ground Zero, and then after I do the speech, I'll try to get off behind it.
[01:47:41.184 --> 01:47:42.665]  Well, you know how many of them died, don't you, Alex?
[01:47:42.705 --> 01:47:43.545]  And how many firefighters died?
[01:47:43.585 --> 01:47:43.845]  You know?
[01:47:43.865 --> 01:47:44.385]  Well, exactly.
[01:47:44.465 --> 01:47:49.387]  And I think the thing that triggered it, I think the thing that did it, was the fact that
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:09.581]  The government lied about the dust, the asbestos, all of it.
[01:48:09.601 --> 01:48:16.224]  Forty floors at least, on average, dissolved into tiny particulates from all the explosives.
[01:48:16.324 --> 01:48:21.386]  Are you saying that Christine Todd Whitman of the Council on Foreign Relations would lie about the toxicity of the air?
[01:48:21.466 --> 01:48:22.407]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:48:22.467 --> 01:48:26.308]  Every day I've been here for the last two and a half days, I've been all over all the papers.
[01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:29.610]  It's front page, they lied on purpose, the city.
[01:48:30.129 --> 01:48:31.189]  Just have the peon.
[01:48:31.309 --> 01:48:32.410]  Yeah, just have the peon.
[01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:33.010]  Yeah.
[01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.130]  Okay.
[01:48:58.689 --> 01:48:59.350]  God bless you.
[01:48:59.750 --> 01:49:09.458]  We'll have somebody dial in with a cell phone, and the board operator will just let you know once the speech has begun, and we'll just fade it up and have a few minutes of it here and there.
[01:49:09.478 --> 01:49:13.381]  And then I'll call under the other program with a more detailed report where I can get away from all the crowds.
[01:49:13.541 --> 01:49:14.001]  All right.
[01:49:14.041 --> 01:49:14.522]  God bless you.
[01:49:14.962 --> 01:49:15.503]  God bless you.
[01:49:15.543 --> 01:49:24.530]  That's Alex Jones up in New York City at Ground Zero attacking the globalists, the murderers, at point-blank range.
[01:49:26.451 --> 01:49:34.958]  We'll be back after the break with the third hour of the Alex Jones Show here on the Genesis Communications Network.
[01:49:35.519 --> 01:49:39.482]  I'm Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex, and we'll see you in a bit.
[01:49:56.383 --> 01:49:59.544]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:59.904 --> 01:50:01.845]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.205 --> 01:50:09.867]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.548 --> 01:50:17.590]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:20.931]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:50:21.311 --> 01:50:23.652]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:50:24.052 --> 01:50:24.872]  NSA spies.
[01:50:26.079 --> 01:50:29.421]  The latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[01:50:29.722 --> 01:50:33.244]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.684 --> 01:50:35.605]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.945 --> 01:50:39.848]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.523 --> 01:50:57.107]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:50:57.147 --> 01:50:57.647]  are located?
[01:50:57.848 --> 01:51:01.251]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:51:01.471 --> 01:51:06.176]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:51:06.456 --> 01:51:11.461]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:12.302]  We're good to go.
[01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:34.405]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:51:52.773 --> 01:51:53.013]  I think?
[01:52:07.853 --> 01:52:12.516]  Ultimate Secure Home is strategically located in the awesome mountains of southwest Colorado.
[01:52:12.736 --> 01:52:19.580]  This patented steel reinforced concrete earth home was built to withstand any natural or man-made disaster you can name.
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:28.765]  Whether that be a forest fire, an earthquake, or even a full-scale nuclear attack, the house is completely off-grid with solar electricity and an independent water supply.
[01:52:29.085 --> 01:52:30.326]  That's www.UltimateSecureHome.com.
[01:52:58.731 --> 01:53:00.652]  We're good to go.
[01:53:00.733 --> 01:53:04.176]  We're good to go.
[01:53:04.196 --> 01:53:05.557]  We're good to go.
[01:53:22.051 --> 01:53:24.872]  I want to talk about the pod people just for a minute.
[01:53:24.972 --> 01:53:27.973]  I know I'm going to get in trouble for this, but I really don't care.
[01:53:27.993 --> 01:53:37.977]  I have no doubt that criminal elements within the United States government participated in the attacks of 9-1-1.
[01:53:38.097 --> 01:53:39.317]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:53:39.437 --> 01:53:40.558]  We've been talking about that.
[01:53:41.733 --> 01:53:45.974]  At length today, however, back up people, listen.
[01:53:47.154 --> 01:53:54.655]  If you are going to remote control a plane into a building, that's a hard enough thing to accomplish and get it right.
[01:53:55.135 --> 01:53:55.876]  Massive plan.
[01:53:56.856 --> 01:54:07.838]  Why complicate the matters further by retrofitting some airplane with some weird pod so that it can shoot a missile at the building before it hits the building?
[01:54:07.878 --> 01:54:09.038]  That is ridiculous.
[01:54:09.821 --> 01:54:13.382]  I mean, it complicates things dramatically.
[01:54:13.982 --> 01:54:15.202]  Also, there's no point in it.
[01:54:15.302 --> 01:54:33.007]  If you've ever seen the movie Alien, which is a fiction, you see the movie Alien, the big, mean, disgusting alien is trying to snap at somebody, and the person is just out of reach of the alien, and then the little mouth comes out of the other mouth of the alien and reaches out even further.
[01:54:33.367 --> 01:54:34.087]  It's stupid.
[01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:37.388]  There is no point of turning what...
[01:54:38.146 --> 01:54:43.867]  A giant missile, which is what the airplane is, having its own baby missile come out of it, it's stupid.
[01:54:44.268 --> 01:54:46.768]  That just happens to be my opinion.
[01:54:47.168 --> 01:54:56.891]  Also, by the way, some of the videos which report to show a missile coming out ignore other videos, which are even better.
[01:54:57.251 --> 01:55:02.192]  As a matter of fact, if you watch Loose Change, Dylan Avery's video,
[01:55:02.972 --> 01:55:11.078]  His documentary, the very first scene of Loose Chains, shows the best view of the plane hitting the South Tower.
[01:55:12.079 --> 01:55:15.161]  There is no pod, and there ain't no missile.
[01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:17.843]  So, let's get off of the weird stuff, okay?
[01:55:17.883 --> 01:55:19.845]  And let's stick to what's concrete.
[01:55:20.565 --> 01:55:24.808]  Right now, we have Joe in Arkansas.
[01:55:24.969 --> 01:55:27.030]  Joe, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:27.070 --> 01:55:28.091]  What do you have to contribute?
[01:55:28.471 --> 01:55:29.012]  Yeah, hi, Bob.
[01:55:29.032 --> 01:55:30.753]  Well, I've got two favorite smoking guns, so...
[01:55:31.448 --> 01:55:38.811]  First one is, I looked up the newspaper story about this on the Internet, and that was that I believe the year was 1945 or 1946, one of those.
[01:55:39.371 --> 01:55:54.977]  The Empire State Building was hit by a B-25 bomber going about 300 miles an hour, and it created a big hole in the side of the Empire State Building, started a fire, did a million dollars worth of damage, but the Empire State Building did not collapse, and neither did any buildings further down the block collapse five or six hours later.
[01:55:55.461 --> 01:55:56.942]  Well, you know, that's a real good point.
[01:55:57.022 --> 01:56:12.631]  However, if I was going to play devil's advocate, I would say, well, see, they knew how to build buildings back then, and that thing was a concrete structure with rebar and all that, and the World Trade Center was built by a bunch of idiots, and therefore, you know, that's why it fell down.
[01:56:12.951 --> 01:56:15.773]  However, you know, your point's well taken, and thank you for the call.
[01:56:18.494 --> 01:56:21.396]  You look at some of the other modern steel frame buildings,
[01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:25.135]  That have been built over the years that went up in flames.
[01:56:25.775 --> 01:56:30.616]  My favorite one is, I think it's the Meridian Tower in Philadelphia.
[01:56:30.636 --> 01:56:33.656]  It's right next to Billy Penn in Philadelphia.
[01:56:33.996 --> 01:56:35.836]  That thing was 38 stories tall.
[01:56:36.097 --> 01:56:37.897]  That thing went up like a Roman candle.
[01:56:37.977 --> 01:56:46.578]  I mean, you're talking about top eight floors, just raging, raging fire, and the stupid thing wouldn't fall down.
[01:56:47.258 --> 01:56:48.399]  Can you imagine that?
[01:56:48.879 --> 01:56:49.679]  But on September 11th,
[01:56:51.163 --> 01:56:55.030]  It's okay to knock them down, but look, that's a very good point.
[01:56:56.152 --> 01:56:59.578]  If you look at the history of buildings, in order to believe
[01:57:00.729 --> 01:57:11.957]  Especially that building number seven collapsed because it fainted or because of the fire is patently and totally ridiculous.
[01:57:13.498 --> 01:57:13.939]  All right.
[01:57:14.259 --> 01:57:15.600]  We're coming up on the third hour.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.442]  Alex is going to be joining us again, I understand.
[01:57:19.042 --> 01:57:21.504]  Things are a little nebulous right now because he's up there in New York.
[01:57:22.124 --> 01:57:26.748]  But we will be back for the third hour of the Alex Jones Show here on September 11th.
[01:57:33.351 --> 01:57:37.233]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.574 --> 01:57:38.394]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.434 --> 01:57:38.914]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.094 --> 01:57:39.975]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.995 --> 01:57:42.356]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.818 --> 01:57:47.019]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.279 --> 01:57:49.661]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.526 --> 01:58:01.148]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:05.811]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.053 --> 01:58:12.556]  Okay, welcome back to the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:12.596 --> 01:58:13.796]  My name is Bob Dacey.
[01:58:14.077 --> 01:58:18.679]  I'm sitting here in the Central Texas Command Center while Alex is out on the front lines.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:24.223]  And I don't know, is he on again, guys, or are we going to wait for his phone call again?
[01:58:25.376 --> 01:58:26.076]  Not yet.
[01:58:26.196 --> 01:58:26.417]  All right.
[01:58:26.437 --> 01:58:27.717]  Well, let's continue.
[01:58:27.797 --> 01:58:29.918]  I'll tell you a little bit more about myself.
[01:58:30.158 --> 01:58:31.259]  Again, my name is Bob Dacey.
[01:58:31.319 --> 01:58:36.682]  I host the Simple Truth TV show here in Austin, Texas, produced by Jeff Cantop and Kelly Taylor.
[01:58:36.702 --> 01:58:43.185]  One of the reasons I do what I do in this info war is because of my father, George Dacey.
[01:58:43.705 --> 01:58:49.328]  This guy was and is my hero and always has been and always will be.
[01:58:49.909 --> 01:58:54.910]  You know, during World War II, he was a Marine Captain, Combat Infantry Officer.
[01:58:56.211 --> 01:59:01.712]  He was a commander of the 2nd Battalion, Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Division.
[01:59:02.412 --> 01:59:06.253]  He participated in two campaigns, two assaults.
[01:59:06.334 --> 01:59:07.894]  One of them was the island of Petaloo.
[01:59:08.672 --> 01:59:13.516]  Peleliu, which was the bloodiest battle involving Americans in World War II.
[01:59:14.877 --> 01:59:26.806]  And he was also, he had the distinct, how should I say, privilege, sarcastically, of being involved in the Okinawa Campaign, which was the biggest battle of the Pacific.
[01:59:27.486 --> 01:59:29.628]  And he was a big hero to me and always has been.
[01:59:30.008 --> 01:59:36.433]  And so, growing up, I was, just by the luck of the draw, I was in high school when the Vietnam War ended.
[01:59:37.057 --> 01:59:42.743]  So I didn't have the opportunity to go serve my country and get shot at.
[01:59:42.803 --> 01:59:44.545]  That's kind of a classic thing.
[01:59:45.026 --> 01:59:46.347]  And I kind of felt guilty about it.
[01:59:47.068 --> 01:59:56.998]  But when I ran into Alex Jones back in 1998 and was shown what was going on, and I fought it all the way, believe me.
[01:59:57.018 --> 01:59:58.500]  I didn't believe any of this stuff back then.
[01:59:59.505 --> 02:00:08.450]  But the proof is incontrovertible about the New World Order, their crowd, the globalists trying to take over the world and turn us into a bunch of slobbering slaves.
[02:00:09.091 --> 02:00:10.532]  I saw a crime being committed.
[02:00:10.772 --> 02:00:15.395]  I realized who was doing it, and I had to do something about it.
[02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:19.537]  When I went to school, they actually taught the Constitution.
[02:00:19.577 --> 02:00:21.058]  They actually taught the Bill of Rights.
[02:00:21.638 --> 02:00:30.742]  When I was a senior in high school, gosh, my final exam in government was to write the Constitution and the Bill of Rights down on a piece of paper with nothing there but blank paper.
[02:00:31.122 --> 02:00:32.463]  Just paraphrase the whole thing.
[02:00:32.943 --> 02:00:35.984]  Article by article, section by section, including all the Bill of Rights.
[02:00:36.245 --> 02:00:39.226]  They used to teach us that stuff, and I believe that stuff.
[02:00:39.366 --> 02:00:40.366]  I believe in America.
[02:00:40.486 --> 02:00:44.648]  I believe in baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Dodge.
[02:00:44.668 --> 02:00:47.690]  You know, I believe in what America is supposed to be.
[02:00:47.770 --> 02:00:48.950]  I believe in the republic.
[02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:50.611]  I believe in limited government.
[02:00:51.238 --> 02:00:56.481]  I believe in personal responsibility and in God's help, with God's help, a better world.
[02:00:56.562 --> 02:00:57.682]  I believe in these things.
[02:00:58.703 --> 02:01:06.628]  And to see it assaulted and to know who's doing it, I felt compelled and still feel compelled to fight.
[02:01:07.148 --> 02:01:10.250]  I wasn't put on this planet to breathe the air.
[02:01:10.450 --> 02:01:12.132]  I was put on this planet to make a difference.
[02:01:12.832 --> 02:01:15.754]  And somehow or other, that's what I'm trying to do.
[02:01:16.554 --> 02:01:18.876]  So anyway, we're in the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.096 --> 02:01:25.221]  And we're talking about the smoking guns of 9-1-1, the direct assault on the American people.
[02:01:26.202 --> 02:01:33.429]  And we have another caller up, Ron, I believe, from Oklahoma, who wants to contribute to this conversation.
[02:01:33.489 --> 02:01:34.671]  Ron, what do you have to say?
[02:01:35.091 --> 02:01:35.832]  Hello, Bob.
[02:01:37.633 --> 02:01:39.135]  I have two smoking guns.
[02:01:39.795 --> 02:01:44.280]  The first one I'm looking at today is Bailey, Oklahoma, in the picture on the front page.
[02:01:45.277 --> 02:01:52.422]  Of the Pentagon, the caption reads, three unidentified rescue workers walk away from the Pentagon crash site on 9-11.
[02:01:52.942 --> 02:01:54.403]  It should read, where's the beef?
[02:01:55.904 --> 02:02:04.850]  I'm looking at a pristine green lawn, a lamppost in the foreground, what appears to be scaffolding to the right.
[02:02:05.511 --> 02:02:07.752]  The roof has fallen in, collapsed.
[02:02:07.772 --> 02:02:08.973]  I don't see an airplane.
[02:02:09.073 --> 02:02:10.354]  I don't see any wreckage.
[02:02:11.355 --> 02:02:12.476]  I don't see any rubble.
[02:02:13.216 --> 02:02:14.177]  I don't see anything.
[02:02:14.985 --> 02:02:15.686]  Yeah.
[02:02:16.686 --> 02:02:17.867]  Something hit that building.
[02:02:18.187 --> 02:02:21.729]  I'm not exactly sure what it was or if it was what they say it was.
[02:02:21.929 --> 02:02:27.152]  I've stayed away from that one because of the massive amounts of disinformation put out about that and the lack of
[02:02:28.004 --> 02:02:28.604]  The videotape.
[02:02:28.665 --> 02:02:30.426]  Why don't they release the videotapes?
[02:02:31.046 --> 02:02:32.187]  That's a good point, Ron.
[02:02:32.507 --> 02:02:37.711]  But again, that's one of those ones I'd like to stay away from because there's so much disinformation about it out there.
[02:02:38.291 --> 02:02:38.932]  All right.
[02:02:38.952 --> 02:02:43.395]  We're going to be back in a few minutes, and we're going to continue this discussion.
[02:02:43.675 --> 02:02:45.056]  I'm Bob Dackey for Alex Jones.
[02:02:48.445 --> 02:02:51.646]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.006 --> 02:02:53.927]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:54.307 --> 02:03:01.949]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.650 --> 02:03:09.672]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.092 --> 02:03:13.013]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:03:13.413 --> 02:03:15.734]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:03:16.154 --> 02:03:16.554]  NSA spy.
[02:03:17.461 --> 02:03:18.181]  Or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:18.261 --> 02:03:19.942]  Or watch it right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:49.123]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:03:49.163 --> 02:03:49.664]  are located?
[02:03:49.864 --> 02:03:53.267]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:03:53.487 --> 02:03:58.191]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:03:58.471 --> 02:04:03.475]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:04:03.655 --> 02:04:04.055]  We're good to go.
[02:04:04.075 --> 02:04:04.656]  We're good to go.
[02:04:24.728 --> 02:04:29.992]  If you're looking at the world today from within the box, you must see total chaos and feel lost with no hope.
[02:04:54.324 --> 02:05:02.086]  Out-of-the-box thinkers, such as Nostradamus, who saw the world from a different perspective, knew that nature or God's truth would prevail.
[02:05:02.826 --> 02:05:12.089]  They saw that today's organized religions and governments are being judged, not with the hand of man through atomic wars, but with the hand of God through natural disasters.
[02:05:13.029 --> 02:05:16.510]  We are judging ourselves during this trying apocalyptic period.
[02:05:19.993 --> 02:05:22.115]  Don't you see this happening through the media today?
[02:05:22.535 --> 02:05:24.316]  Just remember these famous words.
[02:05:24.756 --> 02:05:28.278]  Everything hidden will be uncovered, and the truth will make you free.
[02:05:29.259 --> 02:05:35.162]  For evidence of these statements, get Jerry Vano's new book, The Uncovering of the Greatest Story Never Told.
[02:05:35.502 --> 02:05:38.764]  Go to www.gvano.com.
[02:05:38.944 --> 02:05:40.685]  That's www.gvano.com.
[02:05:46.559 --> 02:05:52.606]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.207 --> 02:05:56.190]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:09.506 --> 02:06:15.428]  Alright, we are back in the third hour of the Alex Jones Show on the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:06:15.528 --> 02:06:19.208]  Once again, my name is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:27.491]  And again, I would be remiss if I didn't remind you, if you want to learn more about all these topics, you need to go to these websites.
[02:06:27.651 --> 02:06:37.073]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, and PropagandaMatrix.com.
[02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:38.210]  www.jbs.org
[02:06:53.095 --> 02:06:54.896]  That's the main site of the John Birch Society.
[02:06:55.276 --> 02:07:04.980]  They have a new format up there similar to what really happened where they post daily news articles pertaining to the New World Order and what's going on.
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.621]  So that's a new one for you.
[02:07:06.661 --> 02:07:10.863]  Try www.jbs.org.
[02:07:11.043 --> 02:07:12.744]  And once again, if you...
[02:07:13.908 --> 02:07:17.231]  Wanted to see some hardcore evidence and you hadn't gotten it yet.
[02:07:17.271 --> 02:07:18.772]  You need to get Terror Storm.
[02:07:18.792 --> 02:07:21.735]  You need Alex's latest video.
[02:07:21.975 --> 02:07:23.136]  You can get it by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:07:23.176 --> 02:07:25.058]  That's 1-888-253-3139 and get Terror Storm.
[02:07:25.118 --> 02:07:31.464]  And if you're here in the Austin area and you want to buy it locally, you can buy it at my store, the Hardware Store Incorporated website.
[02:07:41.664 --> 02:07:45.726]  At Spicewood Springs Road and 183 in North Austin.
[02:07:46.706 --> 02:08:01.411]  Okay, once again, we're talking about the smoking guns of 911, the heinous crime that the insiders have perpetrated on the people of America in order to do what?
[02:08:02.251 --> 02:08:03.412]  You know, let's talk about that.
[02:08:04.192 --> 02:08:05.072]  What are their motives?
[02:08:05.112 --> 02:08:06.173]  I mean, why would they do this?
[02:08:06.213 --> 02:08:06.433]  You know,
[02:08:07.807 --> 02:08:10.828]  One of the motives, you know, you've got to have a motive, and one of them is to make money.
[02:08:11.108 --> 02:08:12.548]  I mean, I'm sorry, that's one of the motives.
[02:08:12.568 --> 02:08:16.689]  You've got the international bankers lend money to governments.
[02:08:17.369 --> 02:08:26.650]  They lend it to both sides in a war, and then the money gets dispersed, and the people that get the money are the insider companies that are spending the money, that get the money.
[02:08:26.690 --> 02:08:34.732]  We're talking about Halliburton, Bechtel, ABR, Kellogg Manor Root, which is the city area of Halliburton.
[02:08:34.752 --> 02:08:36.692]  We're talking about the Carlyle Group.
[02:08:38.607 --> 02:08:39.927]  Think about it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:39.947 --> 02:08:42.068]  We got into a war in Iraq because of this.
[02:08:42.768 --> 02:08:53.670]  And the question you need to ask yourself is, whose money was used to bust up Iraq's infrastructure during Operation Shock and Awe?
[02:08:53.770 --> 02:08:55.510]  Whose money was spent to do that?
[02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:56.751]  Well, yours, wasn't it?
[02:08:57.751 --> 02:09:05.592]  And then after we've busted up their infrastructure, then whose money is going to be spent to fix what we broke with your money?
[02:09:07.013 --> 02:09:08.113]  Your money, again.
[02:09:08.849 --> 02:09:16.633]  So they take your money, bust up a country's infrastructure, and then they take your money to fix what they broke with your money.
[02:09:17.053 --> 02:09:18.574]  And who gets rich?
[02:09:18.674 --> 02:09:24.957]  The military industrial complex that Eisenhower so aptly warned against.
[02:09:25.097 --> 02:09:31.160]  And then you've got the oil prices, the oil companies getting rich, record profits.
[02:09:31.769 --> 02:09:36.775]  You know, they went into Iraq not to increase production.
[02:09:36.856 --> 02:09:39.058]  They went into Iraq to shut production down.
[02:09:39.659 --> 02:09:43.204]  That caused oil prices to skyrocket.
[02:09:43.864 --> 02:09:46.568]  And ladies and gentlemen, you're paying it at the pumps right now.
[02:09:46.588 --> 02:09:48.731]  You know, that's the way it works.
[02:09:49.492 --> 02:09:55.254]  I think of the Iraq war on one level as a Goldfinger scam.
[02:09:55.494 --> 02:10:09.338]  If you remember the old James Bond movie Goldfinger, this evil guy Goldfinger who was in love with gold and just had so much of it, and he had this great plot to go steal the gold in Fort Knox, remember?
[02:10:10.038 --> 02:10:11.819]  But that wasn't what he was trying to do.
[02:10:12.717 --> 02:10:23.461]  What he was trying to do was set off a bomb, a nuclear bomb in Fort Knox and irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox so that it would be useless, so that his gold would be worth even more.
[02:10:23.801 --> 02:10:24.842]  It would skyrocket.
[02:10:25.482 --> 02:10:40.107]  So basically, the war in Iraq, one of the reasons for it, is a goldfinger scam to get the price of existing oil reserves controlled by the oil companies to go up in price when you shut down one of the other sources of supply.
[02:10:40.127 --> 02:10:40.167]  So
[02:10:42.683 --> 02:10:46.606]  Those are a couple of the motives for September 11th.
[02:10:46.987 --> 02:10:49.889]  I understand that Alex is on the line now again up in New York.
[02:10:49.969 --> 02:10:51.570]  So, Alex, what's going on, buddy?
[02:10:53.852 --> 02:10:54.292]  Is he there?
[02:10:54.312 --> 02:10:56.494]  Alex, are you there?
[02:10:56.514 --> 02:10:58.275]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:10:58.295 --> 02:11:00.737]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:11:00.757 --> 02:11:03.019]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:11:03.039 --> 02:11:04.500]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:07.022]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:11:07.042 --> 02:11:08.323]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:11:24.787 --> 02:11:25.187]  All right.
[02:11:25.788 --> 02:11:29.950]  I think that was Alex Jones on his bullhorn up there in New York.
[02:11:30.610 --> 02:11:35.813]  And, gosh, I guess we're going to get some video of that eventually when he gets back.
[02:11:36.814 --> 02:11:42.997]  And, yes, indeed, ladies and gentlemen, 9-11 was an inside job, and there is no doubt about it.
[02:11:43.697 --> 02:11:48.260]  And, again, we're talking about the smoking guns of 9-11, and we haven't even gotten to half of them.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:49.421]  I'm kind of disappointed.
[02:11:49.781 --> 02:11:51.842]  We've only got 45 minutes left in the show.
[02:11:54.090 --> 02:11:57.955]  We haven't even gotten to half of smoking guns.
[02:11:57.995 --> 02:12:03.863]  However, I want to continue with my thoughts on the motives of why the globalists did this to us.
[02:12:05.385 --> 02:12:07.788]  One of them, of course, was to empower the United Nations.
[02:12:08.209 --> 02:12:09.270]  The United Nations is the...
[02:12:11.451 --> 02:12:12.252]  We're good to go.
[02:12:12.272 --> 02:12:12.552]  I think?
[02:12:26.932 --> 02:12:36.001]  And the United States is portrayed as the bad cop, too aggressive, not paying attention, and not doing his job, screwing things up.
[02:12:36.402 --> 02:12:40.646]  And, of course, the UN is going to come and bail us out because they're much more reasonable.
[02:12:40.706 --> 02:12:43.689]  So that's another reason for September 11th.
[02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:49.615]  And another reason for September 11th, which is really the main reason,
[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:57.322]  They're trying to scare us into giving up our liberty and our freedom in order to obtain safety.
[02:12:58.142 --> 02:13:05.384]  You know, Benjamin Franklin, the famous quote, those who would give up essential liberty in order to obtain temporary safety deserve neither.
[02:13:05.404 --> 02:13:07.765]  How many times have you heard that?
[02:13:09.606 --> 02:13:10.206]  It's a tactic.
[02:13:10.286 --> 02:13:10.826]  It's a trick.
[02:13:11.486 --> 02:13:14.587]  They have tried to scare us out of our liberty.
[02:13:15.566 --> 02:13:18.668]  And so, you know, we are the victims of 9-1-1.
[02:13:18.808 --> 02:13:32.399]  All of us, as long as we put up with this garbage, as long as we don't expose the fact that it wasn't 19 Arabs in a cave in Afghanistan that did this to us.
[02:13:33.139 --> 02:13:38.243]  Oh yeah, they might have been participating, but they were patsies, and that's just the way it is.
[02:13:38.763 --> 02:13:42.046]  Now, let's get to some more of these smoking guns.
[02:13:42.166 --> 02:13:42.186]  I
[02:13:42.651 --> 02:13:46.573]  I have a... I've got Mike in Texas up here next.
[02:13:46.673 --> 02:13:46.973]  Mike?
[02:13:47.533 --> 02:13:47.713]  Hey.
[02:13:48.033 --> 02:13:49.574]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:50.014 --> 02:13:50.474]  Hey, thank you.
[02:13:50.494 --> 02:13:51.454]  I really like your show.
[02:13:51.595 --> 02:13:54.176]  Everybody ought to say it in Austin, the simple truth, the three amigos.
[02:13:56.616 --> 02:13:58.877]  That's Jeff and me and Kelly, the three amigos.
[02:13:59.517 --> 02:14:01.497]  Wherever there is injustice, you will find us.
[02:14:01.537 --> 02:14:04.078]  Wherever there is suffering, we'll be there.
[02:14:04.178 --> 02:14:07.719]  Wherever liberty is threatened, you will find the three amigos.
[02:14:07.779 --> 02:14:08.879]  That's Jeff, Kelly, and me.
[02:14:09.159 --> 02:14:10.359]  Thank you for that plug, Mike.
[02:14:10.419 --> 02:14:11.219]  I appreciate that.
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.520]  What do you have on your mind other than that?
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:14.760]  Well, let's see.
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:20.421]  Before I get to my smoking gun, I wonder, I either work at or attend St.
[02:14:20.461 --> 02:14:21.182]  Edward's University.
[02:14:21.202 --> 02:14:22.582]  I don't want to get myself away too much, but
[02:14:23.422 --> 02:14:42.442]  In the cafeteria on the tables they have these little placards that announce the upcoming series of lectures from your favorite people in the United Nations and presumably the Council of Foreign Relations coming to that lecture about the role of the United Nations in the upcoming world and things.
[02:14:42.622 --> 02:14:44.004]  It's just obviously a
[02:14:44.679 --> 02:14:44.959]  Yeah.
[02:14:45.319 --> 02:14:47.781]  Mike, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[02:14:47.961 --> 02:14:50.082]  I've experienced that myself over there at St.
[02:14:50.202 --> 02:14:50.442]  Ed's.
[02:14:51.123 --> 02:14:53.804]  And I might comment on that after we talk to Alex.
[02:14:53.924 --> 02:14:56.546]  But the commander of the Rebel Alliance is back on.
[02:14:56.586 --> 02:14:58.687]  Mike, thanks for the phone call.
[02:14:58.747 --> 02:15:00.528]  And Alex, I understand you're back on the line.
[02:15:15.134 --> 02:15:19.196]  It isn't about having a bunch of Chinese slaves there to protect the flag.
[02:15:19.416 --> 02:15:26.099]  It's about bleeding red, white, and blue and knowing what the bill of rights of the Constitution is.
[02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:31.841]  Any government that tells you to give up liberty for disparity are liars!
[02:15:31.921 --> 02:15:36.223]  When you give up liberty, you get penalty!
[02:15:37.881 --> 02:15:40.744]  You're not in security, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:40.764 --> 02:15:48.051]  Hitler promised that the Germans would give up their rights under the terror attacks and shames against their own government, blaming them on enemies.
[02:15:48.471 --> 02:15:52.715]  Hitler promised that if the people gave up all their freedoms, he'd keep them safe.
[02:15:52.735 --> 02:15:57.260]  20 million dead Germans, and tens of millions of other dead.
[02:15:58.181 --> 02:16:02.385]  According to all of Cher's, Gypsy's, Christian's, anyone that stood up against Hitler,
[02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:06.032]  That's where Spanish terror attacks the 10th power!
[02:16:06.892 --> 02:16:12.895]  George Bush's grandfather was the top Nazi in the US!
[02:16:13.175 --> 02:16:15.397]  It was in New York Times in 1955!
[02:16:15.557 --> 02:16:20.019]  Examining 100 types of papers in New Jersey during World War 4 in the 40s.
[02:16:25.408 --> 02:16:45.758]  I challenge the police and others here to go online, to go to the newspaper archives, and read the actual little archives and other newspaper articles about George Bush's grandfather and brother-in-law in Harriman Building down the street being the top Nazi agent in the United States!
[02:16:45.798 --> 02:16:47.379]  Senator Harry in 1942!
[02:16:47.459 --> 02:16:48.580]  Get his ass at me!
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.102]  What do you think Spike Lee's dickhead movie Inside Man was about?
[02:16:53.999 --> 02:16:56.381]  That stuff's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:57.161 --> 02:16:58.222]  It's a reality.
[02:16:58.663 --> 02:17:09.330]  The nest egg the Bushes made off of their dealings with Hitler is what was yours to get them into power to start a Spanish terror attack.
[02:17:09.350 --> 02:17:09.911]  Shut up!
[02:17:17.028 --> 02:17:18.730]  Us with them are just puppets.
[02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:26.517]  The New World Order, the Council on Foreign Relations, set up by the British, here in New York, at Pratt House, in the early 1920s.
[02:17:26.537 --> 02:17:32.562]  They're the people that have gotten control of most of all our corporations.
[02:17:32.862 --> 02:17:36.806]  They're the people that manipulate and control our universities and our media.
[02:17:36.826 --> 02:17:40.749]  It's the New World Order's global crime syndicate.
[02:17:41.290 --> 02:17:43.492]  George Bush is just a puppet in all this.
[02:17:46.215 --> 02:17:46.875]  Hello, folks.

[02:18:47.586 --> 02:18:48.627]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:49.028 --> 02:18:54.513]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:55.094 --> 02:18:55.594]  That's right.
[02:18:55.895 --> 02:18:58.197]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:58.758 --> 02:19:05.685]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.221 --> 02:19:13.930]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.371 --> 02:19:19.177]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.847 --> 02:19:24.849]  If you'd like to take a look at gold-free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.649 --> 02:19:29.790]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:30.410]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.430 --> 02:19:32.351]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.431 --> 02:19:32.731]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.031 --> 02:19:33.311]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.810 --> 02:19:49.352]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.852 --> 02:19:55.175]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[02:19:55.856 --> 02:20:02.020]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children and the whole world?
[02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:05.522]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:20:05.922 --> 02:20:06.763]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-
[02:20:21.738 --> 02:20:22.438]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:47.197 --> 02:20:48.898]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[02:20:49.079 --> 02:20:51.680]  Are you totally satisfied with the nourishment you're getting?
[02:20:51.781 --> 02:20:54.803]  Do you have enough energy to do everything you really want to do?
[02:20:55.043 --> 02:20:58.505]  And are you content to remain in your current state of health indefinitely?
[02:20:58.786 --> 02:21:04.610]  Have you already tried diets, exercise, vitamins, juicing, or the latest greatest nutritional wonder products?
[02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:09.753]  Perhaps those things have grown tiresome and not made you feel and look as well as you'd really like to.

[02:21:20.659 --> 02:21:21.960]  Well, you just did.

[02:21:37.029 --> 02:21:40.813]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:40.873 --> 02:21:43.195]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:00.622 --> 02:22:01.703]  Alright, we're back.
[02:22:01.723 --> 02:22:08.966]  Again, my name is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones on the 5th anniversary of September 11th, which was an inside job.
[02:22:09.646 --> 02:22:14.488]  Alex was just giving a speech there at Ground Zero.
[02:22:14.789 --> 02:22:16.049]  Do we still have him, guys?
[02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:20.751]  Okay, we're going to go back to Alex Jones live in New York City right now.
[02:22:21.732 --> 02:22:23.753]  They lied to us about what the air was doing.
[02:22:24.313 --> 02:22:26.674]  They lied to us about every foot.
[02:22:27.884 --> 02:22:29.445]  I noticed the plastic handcuffs are out.
[02:22:29.465 --> 02:22:30.326]  We're behaving well.
[02:22:30.766 --> 02:22:32.808]  Oh, nothing starts up.
[02:22:34.129 --> 02:22:37.692]  And then we'll get arrested for talking about the dust.
[02:22:37.712 --> 02:22:40.855]  In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:22:40.875 --> 02:22:41.275]  That's right.
[02:22:41.295 --> 02:22:45.199]  In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:22:45.579 --> 02:22:46.340]  George Orwell.
[02:22:53.007 --> 02:22:56.089]  It isn't just Operation Northwood, the official U.S.
[02:22:56.129 --> 02:22:59.811]  government plan to stage 9-11-style attacks.
[02:23:00.452 --> 02:23:01.572]  It's not just that.
[02:23:02.333 --> 02:23:15.141]  It's subpoenaed documents written by Jim Bush and Dick Cheney a year before 9-11, where they said we need a massive terror attack to get the people behind the war.
[02:23:15.421 --> 02:23:16.582]  And they've published it!
[02:23:16.822 --> 02:23:18.603]  That's how arrogant they are!
[02:23:27.471 --> 02:23:32.695]  And let me make, let me make another key point here.
[02:23:38.695 --> 02:23:50.359]  Over the years, over 50 representatives of the 9-11 family's victims, including Bill Doyle, the head of the biggest 9-11 corp with 7,000 plus members.
[02:23:50.379 --> 02:23:55.100]  You know what Bill told me about the Goldmine Show?
[02:23:55.540 --> 02:23:57.721]  He now believes it's an inside show!
[02:24:04.728 --> 02:24:06.369]  We're good to go.
[02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:07.230]  We're good to go.
[02:24:31.857 --> 02:24:33.918]  We are never going to stop.
[02:24:34.499 --> 02:24:36.520]  We are never going to stop together.
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:43.024]  We have already proven it's an inside job and we get more proof every day as we continue to run and run and run and run.
[02:24:43.084 --> 02:24:44.925]  So many prominent people have gone public.
[02:24:53.803 --> 02:25:07.170]  One of the chief CIA officers who ran the whole division of the CIA, Bill Christensen, last week on my show, said he looked at the evidence, he researched it, he couldn't believe it, and he said he broke down and cried when he finally realized it.
[02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:09.791]  He said 9-11 was an inside job!
[02:25:09.811 --> 02:25:11.192]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:25:11.252 --> 02:25:13.053]  He said the 9-11 job is the CIA!
[02:25:16.391 --> 02:25:25.655]  Ancient Middle America, who the movie Stereo Artisan made about, high-level CIA operatives, he told the public, saying 9-11 clearly is an inside job.
[02:25:26.696 --> 02:25:40.822]  Ray McGovern, the brainchild of Orson Welles and George Washington, for eight years, two administrations, six years, two administrations, have gone public saying, clearly our government stages terrorist attacks.
[02:25:44.318 --> 02:25:52.906]  The former German Defense Minister, former Minister of Technology in Germany has gone public saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:25:53.726 --> 02:26:04.136]  It was studied by the former Tenement Defense Minister, former Minister of Technology, who also previously ran a German intelligence.
[02:26:04.847 --> 02:26:14.011]  The former head of piloting colleges says Kyle Levin is an inside job unmistakable.
[02:26:14.071 --> 02:26:25.896]  Because if you've got a brain and you actually look at the facts, Michael Meacher, the president, has gone public saying Kyle Levin is an inside job.
[02:26:25.936 --> 02:26:28.957]  Morgan Reynolds, Dr. Morgan Reynolds,
[02:26:33.346 --> 02:26:39.590]  The former head of the current Bush chief of communists has gone public.
[02:26:40.591 --> 02:26:45.234]  Did I trust that Bill Hamill or the prominent people that have gone public on 9-11?
[02:26:45.614 --> 02:26:46.675]  It was amazing.
[02:26:46.695 --> 02:26:47.996]  Go research it.
[02:26:48.416 --> 02:26:49.377]  Find out the truth.
[02:26:49.437 --> 02:26:50.858]  That's what I'm looking for.
[02:26:50.878 --> 02:26:51.939]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[02:27:01.308 --> 02:27:02.429]  That's not a job!
[02:27:02.789 --> 02:27:03.870]  That's not a job!
[02:27:03.890 --> 02:27:04.931]  That's not a job!
[02:27:05.292 --> 02:27:06.192]  That's not a job!
[02:27:06.212 --> 02:27:08.094]  That's not a job!
[02:27:08.154 --> 02:27:09.856]  That's not a job!
[02:27:35.572 --> 02:27:36.454]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.954 --> 02:27:38.577]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.498 --> 02:27:42.183]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.665 --> 02:27:48.045]  We're good to go.
[02:28:09.255 --> 02:28:19.717]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:28:19.857 --> 02:28:23.398]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.

[02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:31.220]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:31.420]  1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[02:28:45.979 --> 02:28:46.660]  Hello, folks.

[02:29:36.142 --> 02:29:38.003]  I have an urgent message for all of our listeners.
[02:29:38.063 --> 02:29:41.684]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:29:41.784 --> 02:29:43.685]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:05.172]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:30:05.733 --> 02:30:09.856]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:30:10.436 --> 02:30:13.438]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:30:14.399 --> 02:30:17.321]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:30:18.041 --> 02:30:20.503]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:30:20.543 --> 02:30:22.564]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:34.101]  Call 888-8XANADU and ask for George.
[02:30:53.371 --> 02:30:55.492]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:55.512 --> 02:30:56.752]  My name is Bob Dacey.
[02:30:56.852 --> 02:31:02.314]  Alex is up in New York, still bullhorning the crowd, and we're going to go back live to Alex in New York City.
[02:31:02.414 --> 02:31:02.814]  Go ahead.
[02:31:09.341 --> 02:31:16.447]  As soon as we get out here and start speaking about the truth, they get policed out here with machine guns, and they show up with the longer bracelets.
[02:31:16.747 --> 02:31:18.349]  There is no reason for this.
[02:31:18.669 --> 02:31:21.151]  We're not the terrorists that carried out 9-11.
[02:31:21.431 --> 02:31:23.693]  The victim's family believe it's an inside job.
[02:31:23.973 --> 02:31:25.495]  We know it's an inside job.
[02:31:25.855 --> 02:31:29.378]  The majority of the American people know it's an inside job.
[02:31:29.438 --> 02:31:31.100]  We will never back off.
[02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:33.061]  We will never surrender.
[02:31:37.142 --> 02:31:39.584]  We're going to bring these criminals to justice.
[02:31:39.844 --> 02:31:40.685]  We absolutely must.
[02:31:41.205 --> 02:31:44.948]  None of us are safe while the New World Order is in control of our government.
[02:31:45.569 --> 02:31:49.172]  They're the same people creating the North American Union to get rid of our sovereignty.
[02:31:49.472 --> 02:31:51.514]  They're the same people with the no-bid contracts.
[02:31:51.874 --> 02:31:54.496]  They're the same people destroying our economy.
[02:31:54.736 --> 02:31:58.299]  They're the same people that have spent more money than all presidents before them could buy.
[02:31:59.040 --> 02:32:01.802]  The United States is being lauded by the globalists.
[02:32:02.643 --> 02:32:07.524]  They're calling out 9-11 because without doing that, they wouldn't have been able to get away with their looting.
[02:32:07.544 --> 02:32:11.185]  They knew the American people wouldn't put up with it.
[02:32:11.485 --> 02:32:13.605]  The government's own documents and the P.S.'
[02:32:13.565 --> 02:32:26.208]  's own documents say we needed terrorist attacks to get the American people behind their agenda of one world government, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:32:26.728 --> 02:32:28.249]  That's what happened.
[02:32:28.829 --> 02:32:29.549]  That's the truth.
[02:32:30.916 --> 02:32:34.337]  This is what we face as a society.
[02:32:35.377 --> 02:32:42.499]  Everyone out there who questions us has got to Google Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:46.381]  government plan to carry out a 9-11 style attack.
[02:32:46.441 --> 02:32:47.761]  Everyone must learn the truth.
[02:32:49.081 --> 02:32:52.482]  There are other declassified documents of Operation 8X, Gladio,
[02:32:58.206 --> 02:32:59.026]  We're good to go.
[02:32:59.066 --> 02:33:00.006]  We're good to go.
[02:33:27.313 --> 02:33:31.118]  The Tuskegee Project killed black men in America.
[02:33:31.979 --> 02:33:37.305]  The documents came out that the Pentagon knew that the atomic testing was going to kill our troops.
[02:33:37.485 --> 02:33:38.426]  They didn't care.
[02:33:38.786 --> 02:33:43.532]  I asked my dad when I was a child, I said, Daddy, why didn't they just test the nukes on monkeys?
[02:33:43.772 --> 02:33:46.715]  And he said, son, nukes are like people and monkeys.
[02:33:48.328 --> 02:33:52.649]  That's what the government thinks of you, police and military!
[02:33:52.669 --> 02:33:57.910]  I serve America and the United States, not the hijackers that have hijacked this country!
[02:33:58.010 --> 02:34:01.771]  They're laughing at you!
[02:34:01.972 --> 02:34:05.132]  They're hoping you don't check into Operation Northwood!
[02:34:05.512 --> 02:34:06.253]  Operation Ajax!
[02:34:06.293 --> 02:34:09.794]  They're hoping you don't check into the USS Liberty!
[02:34:10.134 --> 02:34:13.254]  They're hoping that you don't check into all of this!
[02:34:13.454 --> 02:34:15.215]  They're hoping that you don't learn!
[02:34:15.836 --> 02:34:21.763]  The criminal elements of our government are staging terror attacks.
[02:34:21.863 --> 02:34:25.867]  Out of thermal video, it says terror storm.
[02:34:26.207 --> 02:34:27.989]  That's a terror storm.
[02:34:28.250 --> 02:34:33.716]  And she might as well, or maybe one who really carried out 9-11, go to thermal video,
[02:34:34.707 --> 02:34:35.748]  We're good to go.
[02:34:35.788 --> 02:34:37.629]  We're good to go.
[02:34:50.029 --> 02:34:52.191]  Google Terror Storm!
[02:34:52.491 --> 02:34:54.132]  Come to Operation Northwood!
[02:34:54.452 --> 02:34:57.154]  Come to West Trail!
[02:34:57.374 --> 02:34:58.735]  Water gets admitted!
[02:34:58.895 --> 02:35:00.676]  That's how dumb they think we are!
[02:35:00.896 --> 02:35:01.997]  They declassify us!
[02:35:02.017 --> 02:35:03.098]  They attack us!
[02:35:03.278 --> 02:35:03.979]  They kill us!
[02:35:03.999 --> 02:35:05.580]  They kill all people!
[02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:07.581]  They don't treat the emergency workers!
[02:35:07.741 --> 02:35:09.022]  They laugh at us!
[02:35:09.062 --> 02:35:11.103]  They think we're their slaves!
[02:35:11.484 --> 02:35:12.324]  It never ends!
[02:35:12.484 --> 02:35:17.788]  They're a little more reluctant to think workers are killing us and exploiting us and doing horrible things to us!
[02:35:17.988 --> 02:35:19.049]  They think we're dumb!
[02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:25.853]  We need to stand up against them and let the real past know we're never backing down from the people that died.
[02:35:28.941 --> 02:35:30.863]  We're going to defend the republic!
[02:35:30.903 --> 02:35:31.784]  God bless you all!
[02:36:05.524 --> 02:36:08.326]  Alright, that was Alex Jones live in New York City.
[02:36:08.747 --> 02:36:18.855]  You know, you listen to the man, he's out there in a crowd and you can tell the energy he's got, how
[02:36:29.814 --> 02:36:31.315]  He's shrill, actually.
[02:36:31.355 --> 02:36:32.995]  And a lot of people complain about Alex.
[02:36:33.035 --> 02:36:34.556]  They say he's just too wild.
[02:36:34.996 --> 02:36:42.379]  You know, the bottom line with Alex Jones, and I've heard this over and over again, is that that's the way he is.
[02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:44.020]  That's the way Alex is.
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:45.781]  What you see is what you get.
[02:36:45.841 --> 02:36:46.921]  That's his personality.
[02:36:47.081 --> 02:36:48.822]  And guess what?
[02:36:48.842 --> 02:36:50.523]  And he says it over and over and over again.
[02:36:50.563 --> 02:36:51.583]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[02:36:51.643 --> 02:36:52.523]  It's about what he's saying.
[02:36:52.543 --> 02:36:54.264]  And he's absolutely right.
[02:36:54.584 --> 02:36:58.666]  Everything he just shouted out there, everything he just shouted out,
[02:36:59.474 --> 02:37:04.217]  It's absolutely, totally, documentably, verifiably true.
[02:37:05.238 --> 02:37:07.259]  And that's what it's all about, is the truth.
[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:12.803]  And Alex, of course, I think has been more effective at getting out truth than any individual on the planet.
[02:37:13.783 --> 02:37:14.764]  And I salute him for that.
[02:37:15.845 --> 02:37:17.886]  Lord knows I don't have that kind of energy.
[02:37:18.026 --> 02:37:20.768]  My goodness, I swear, about two minutes of that, I'd be on the ground.
[02:37:21.468 --> 02:37:25.471]  Anyway, once again, this is Bob Basie substituting back here
[02:37:26.814 --> 02:37:32.657]  In Austin for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show on the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:37:33.577 --> 02:37:37.379]  And I want to go to another caller.
[02:37:37.399 --> 02:37:39.640]  We're talking about the smoking guns of 9-1-1.
[02:37:40.001 --> 02:37:42.242]  And I want to go to Brandon in Ohio.
[02:37:42.282 --> 02:37:43.282]  Brandon, are you still there?
[02:37:45.703 --> 02:37:46.464]  Brandon, are you there?
[02:37:46.484 --> 02:37:49.285]  I guess not.
[02:37:49.345 --> 02:37:50.226]  Brandon must have hung up.
[02:37:50.826 --> 02:37:51.186]  He dropped.
[02:37:51.838 --> 02:37:53.260]  Uh-oh.
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:54.021]  Alex is back.
[02:37:54.061 --> 02:37:55.683]  We're going to go back to New York.
[02:37:55.783 --> 02:37:56.704]  Alex Jones is back.
[02:37:56.724 --> 02:37:57.245]  Go ahead, guys.
[02:37:57.265 --> 02:37:59.468]  It is not only Willie Brown.
[02:37:59.988 --> 02:38:07.297]  Ariel Shalom was supposed to come to New York on September 11th to send death to the FBI of Israel in conjunction with the CIA.
[02:38:08.533 --> 02:38:09.533]  Cancel that flight!
[02:38:10.114 --> 02:38:14.815]  Every major intelligence agency had complete heads-up on the events of 9-11.
[02:38:14.855 --> 02:38:21.177]  The San Francisco Chronicle ran a five-column headline, How could we not have known?
[02:38:21.597 --> 02:38:34.461]  The former Secretary of State, George Shultz, confirmed to the San Francisco Chronicle, to the Washington Post, that he had received a heads-up from the State Department seven days prior to 9-11.
[02:38:35.541 --> 02:38:42.005]  A complete delineation shows the former Secretary of State advised not to travel on September 11th.
[02:38:42.385 --> 02:38:49.349]  It's all over the established press, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the San Francisco Chronicle.
[02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:51.291]  It's not a question of guessing.
[02:38:51.631 --> 02:38:53.452]  It's not a question of speculation.
[02:38:53.912 --> 02:39:02.665]  Ladies and gentlemen, consider that Newsweek and the Washington Post and nightly newspapers reported the following, quote, U.S.
[02:39:02.765 --> 02:39:08.534]  military sources have confirmed that five of the accused terrorists, including Mohammed Atta,
[02:39:08.934 --> 02:39:12.197]  We're clear through and trained at secure U.S.
[02:39:12.477 --> 02:39:16.200]  military installations, and I'm quoting here from Newsweek!
[02:39:16.740 --> 02:39:23.966]  Mohamed Atta was trained at the International Oversight School at Max Willis for Space in Montgomery, Alabama.
[02:39:24.306 --> 02:39:32.092]  Abdul Aziz Al-Abain was trained with Crypto Security Clearance at the Air Force School at Brookside for Space in Texas.
[02:39:32.553 --> 02:39:37.817]  Zaheer Yakhmadi attended the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California.
[02:39:38.277 --> 02:39:53.180]  Truth Week's George Westridge, Patrick Schiff, and John Berry concluded, quote, five of the accused hijackers of the planes used in Tuesday's terror attack received their clearance in training a secure U.S.
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:55.180]  military installation.
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:40:00.422]  The whole world's press is fully cognizant of what occurred on 9-11, brothers and sisters.
[02:40:00.442 --> 02:40:01.462]  We don't suspect
[02:40:02.822 --> 02:40:04.063]  We're good to go.
[02:40:24.722 --> 02:40:37.260]  Robert Townsend, in his book Up the Organization, calculates that approximately 5,000 people control what he calls the commanding life of the United States of America, the average 14 corporate directorships per person.
[02:40:39.904 --> 02:40:43.809]  They have dominance over the corporate and banking sector of capital.
[02:40:43.829 --> 02:40:52.699]  As Robert Townsend put it, they regard this country as their own whorehouse, and they consider each president their personal cowboy.
[02:40:52.859 --> 02:40:54.401]  That's what underlies.
[02:40:54.421 --> 02:40:58.045]  They want to support our living standards and against working people.
[02:40:58.305 --> 02:41:00.448]  The eight-hour day is a thing of the past.
[02:41:00.868 --> 02:41:02.209]  Forget your health care!
[02:41:02.249 --> 02:41:03.089]  Forget your pensions!
[02:41:03.150 --> 02:41:05.051]  They can switch up labor!
[02:41:05.091 --> 02:41:09.314]  They shut down a plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan!
[02:41:09.334 --> 02:41:14.897]  They opened it up in Western China where they could pay people $40 a month!
[02:41:15.097 --> 02:41:17.499]  They shut down the plant in Tarrytown, New York!
[02:41:17.919 --> 02:41:23.422]  They opened it up in Toluca, Mexico, where they can pay people $8 for a 10-hour stay.
[02:41:23.502 --> 02:41:25.563]  That is the way they whip-throw workers.
[02:41:25.603 --> 02:41:29.426]  That is the way they take away all the gains in 100 years.
[02:41:29.466 --> 02:41:45.775]  While four years of Pentagon receipts for people who have been paying the trillion dollars, $10 trillion in 40 years for the Pentagon, that's more than the combined value, brothers and sisters, of everything produced in this country taken together.
[02:41:46.415 --> 02:42:01.108]  And on September 10th, 2001, Dan Rather, CBS News, reports that in the year 2000, $2.3 trillion of the Pentagon's accumulated funds were, quote, lost, unquote.
[02:42:01.328 --> 02:42:03.110]  And the year before that...
[02:42:03.730 --> 02:42:05.691]  1.4 trillion dollars!
[02:42:05.771 --> 02:42:17.437]  When Robert G. Lieberman, the general accounting officer, testifies before Congress, he confirms that 7.2 trillion dollars of Pentagon funds are lost without a paper trail!
[02:42:17.517 --> 02:42:19.198]  What does that mean?
[02:42:19.298 --> 02:42:21.319]  Lost 7 trillion dollars, brothers and sisters!
[02:42:21.419 --> 02:42:24.720]  A trillion dollars is a thousand dollars a minute!
[02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:26.261]  It's the dust of Jesus!
[02:42:26.281 --> 02:42:28.962]  9-11 is to keep that control!
[02:42:29.362 --> 02:42:30.363]  To keep that power!
[02:42:30.803 --> 02:42:31.203]  Thank you.
[02:42:56.315 --> 02:43:03.416]  We had an incredible event at Cooper Energy on the last night, and he's almost here.
[02:43:03.436 --> 02:43:07.877]  Our last speaker is going to be this amazing hip-hop artist, Immortal Technique.
[02:43:07.957 --> 02:43:13.979]  He's going to be speaking for about 25-30 minutes, and we hope a lot of you will follow us.
[02:43:14.419 --> 02:43:15.839]  We're going down to Spencer's office.
[02:43:15.979 --> 02:43:24.641]  The man, that he launched a real state investigation into the dust that everybody breathed,
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:28.341]  We are going to never stop.
[02:43:28.361 --> 02:43:30.963]  We are standing up against this bullet.
[02:43:31.003 --> 02:43:39.509]  So anybody that wants to go with us, just follow us down to Spitzer's office, and then we're going to shoot you up.
[02:43:49.386 --> 02:43:51.967]  Police applause, though, to have a presence in the city.
[02:43:52.327 --> 02:43:55.749]  Police come with us in about 30 minutes, or 35 minutes, before we leave.
[02:43:55.789 --> 02:43:57.570]  We'll be coming around in this direction.
[02:43:57.590 --> 02:43:59.230]  You'll need to come across and get behind us.
[02:43:59.510 --> 02:44:03.232]  We'll need to go about two by two, so we don't walk too much further to the street.
[02:44:03.252 --> 02:44:04.533]  So we'll have to come along.
[02:44:04.913 --> 02:44:09.355]  Our motor will take me here in the next five minutes, or so, as soon as he gets here and starts the traffic.
[02:44:11.937 --> 02:44:12.797]  9-11's an inside job!
[02:44:12.817 --> 02:44:13.878]  9-11's an inside job!
[02:44:13.898 --> 02:44:15.498]  9-11's an inside job!
[02:44:15.519 --> 02:44:16.519]  9-11's an inside job!
[02:44:16.539 --> 02:44:17.960]  9-11's an inside job!
[02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:19.180]  9-11's an inside job!
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:21.281]  9-11's an inside job!
[02:44:21.781 --> 02:44:30.105]  Here he is, doing a great job fighting the fight for the people against oppression, a mortal great name!
[02:44:45.253 --> 02:44:48.416]  Alright, that's Alex Jones up in New York.
[02:44:49.157 --> 02:44:54.421]  I'll tell you what, like I say, the guy's got more energy than I can possibly imagine.
[02:44:54.762 --> 02:45:02.068]  This is Bob Dacey holding the fort down here in Austin, Texas on the Alex Jones Show, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:45:03.349 --> 02:45:10.196]  I want to go through a little bit of stuff about, kind of sum this up, you know, what has been spawned by September 11th?
[02:45:10.236 --> 02:45:11.056]  That's a good question.
[02:45:11.116 --> 02:45:11.597]  What has been...
[02:45:12.768 --> 02:45:13.168]  We're good to go.
[02:45:13.208 --> 02:45:13.688]  We're good to go.
[02:45:35.085 --> 02:45:36.066]  So that we could do what?
[02:45:36.086 --> 02:45:39.447]  Shut down the oil supply and jack up the price of gas?
[02:45:39.547 --> 02:45:40.128]  Partially.
[02:45:40.288 --> 02:45:40.788]  Partially.
[02:45:41.308 --> 02:45:46.310]  You've got almost 3,000 dead Americans.
[02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:48.031]  3,000 of our young people dead over there.
[02:45:48.711 --> 02:45:50.912]  And there is no end in sight, is there?
[02:45:51.624 --> 02:46:00.670]  You've got 18 to 20,000 wounded over there in Iraq, spawned from 9-1-1, and there is no end in sight there.
[02:46:00.690 --> 02:46:10.918]  You're talking about people with missing arms and legs and eyes and feet and whatever for the rest of their lives because of the lie of 9-1-1.
[02:46:10.958 --> 02:46:12.739]  You've got 100,000 other people dead over there
[02:46:15.163 --> 02:46:18.965]  You know, Iraqi civilians, most of them, they didn't do anything to us.
[02:46:19.025 --> 02:46:21.827]  They had no power to do anything to us, and there's no insight in that.
[02:46:22.687 --> 02:46:31.112]  You know, you've got us contaminating that part of the world with depleted uranium contamination, and a lot of people think, oh, well, so what?
[02:46:31.132 --> 02:46:32.172]  It's just a bunch of Arabs.
[02:46:32.232 --> 02:46:33.433]  It's just a bunch of Iraqis.
[02:46:33.633 --> 02:46:35.354]  Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:46:35.915 --> 02:46:40.877]  American soldiers are waiting around in that depleted uranium dust right now, even as we speak.
[02:46:41.718 --> 02:46:43.799]  It's a deplorable, deplorable...
[02:46:44.574 --> 02:46:45.514]  Monstrosity.
[02:46:46.175 --> 02:46:46.815]  Travesty.
[02:46:47.455 --> 02:46:55.317]  You know, you've got the New World Order crowd controlling our media trying to scare us into a war with Iran now.
[02:46:55.357 --> 02:46:56.598]  You know, we don't have enough war.
[02:46:56.618 --> 02:47:00.839]  We've got to have another war to go sacrifice your children to for these people.
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:10.002]  You've got the creation of the Department of Homeland Security as a result of 9-1-1.
[02:47:11.202 --> 02:47:13.043]  You've got the Patriot Act that they passed.
[02:47:13.561 --> 02:47:16.223]  They wrote it before 9-1-1, but they got it passed.
[02:47:16.283 --> 02:47:18.825]  And, you know, it shreds the Bill of Rights.
[02:47:18.925 --> 02:47:21.146]  It reports to, says it does.
[02:47:21.787 --> 02:47:28.452]  You know, my favorite one of those things is Section 213, which says, oh, you don't need no stinkin' Fourth Amendment anymore in America.
[02:47:28.492 --> 02:47:29.553]  You don't need it anymore.
[02:47:29.893 --> 02:47:33.836]  You don't need a warrant and reasonable cause to search and seize.
[02:47:34.176 --> 02:47:37.979]  That's part of the new America spawned by September 11th.
[02:47:38.914 --> 02:47:46.808]  And of course, to go along with that, you've got wholesale spying on the American people by our own government because apparently they think we're the enemy.
[02:47:47.432 --> 02:47:50.974]  Osama Bin Laden attacks us, and so they spy on us, right?
[02:47:51.414 --> 02:47:52.054]  Think about that.
[02:47:52.094 --> 02:47:54.736]  Does that make any sense at all?
[02:47:55.276 --> 02:47:56.036]  I don't think so.
[02:47:57.197 --> 02:47:58.697]  And then what else do you have?
[02:47:58.778 --> 02:48:03.440]  Gosh, we have... It's okay to arrest and detain Americans without charges now.
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:05.621]  That's the new America since 9-1-1.
[02:48:05.761 --> 02:48:10.703]  Now, the Padilla case was the classic example of that.
[02:48:11.264 --> 02:48:12.004]  You know, you can just...
[02:48:12.644 --> 02:48:14.785]  Don't worry about the writ of habeas corpus.
[02:48:15.105 --> 02:48:17.046]  Turn the accused over to the court.
[02:48:17.386 --> 02:48:21.367]  You don't need it anymore in September because of 9-1-1.
[02:48:22.427 --> 02:48:23.548]  That's what's going on.
[02:48:23.588 --> 02:48:25.429]  I'm going to continue with this after the break.
[02:48:25.449 --> 02:48:29.610]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:48:48.707 --> 02:48:51.890]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.230 --> 02:48:54.132]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.552 --> 02:49:02.218]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:09.924]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.344 --> 02:49:13.287]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[02:49:13.667 --> 02:49:15.989]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[02:49:16.409 --> 02:49:16.890]  NSA spies.
[02:49:17.719 --> 02:49:21.783]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.063 --> 02:49:25.586]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.026 --> 02:49:27.968]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.288 --> 02:49:32.191]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:50.397 --> 02:49:54.840]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:49:55.020 --> 02:50:09.027]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.

[02:50:11.889 --> 02:50:12.970]  The Berkey Security Pack.

[02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:40.636]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.407 --> 02:50:47.227]  Come on, Bill.
[02:50:47.447 --> 02:50:52.631]  Two weeks ago you were riding the bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[02:50:52.951 --> 02:50:54.452]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[02:50:54.552 --> 02:50:56.533]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[02:50:56.813 --> 02:51:02.337]  What I did do is visit the website www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:51:02.617 --> 02:51:08.881]  That's where I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[02:51:09.201 --> 02:51:11.423]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[02:51:11.683 --> 02:51:13.004]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[02:51:15.345 --> 02:51:15.785]  Whoa.
[02:51:16.145 --> 02:51:17.365]  What was that website again?
[02:51:17.425 --> 02:51:20.926]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:51:21.226 --> 02:51:22.326]  Now write this down, John.
[02:51:22.466 --> 02:51:26.767]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[02:51:26.927 --> 02:51:27.507]  Thanks, Bill.
[02:51:27.767 --> 02:51:28.988]  I'm going there right now.
[02:51:29.388 --> 02:51:30.068]  Check, please.
[02:51:31.808 --> 02:51:33.268]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[02:51:33.749 --> 02:51:34.349]  Sure, John.
[02:51:34.569 --> 02:51:38.949]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[02:51:39.230 --> 02:51:40.930]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:41.350]  Deal.
[02:51:57.932 --> 02:52:01.695]  Okay, this is Bob Dicey substituting for Alex Jones.
[02:52:01.755 --> 02:52:06.679]  In the last few minutes we have, I want to continue on with a summary of what spawned from 9-1-1.
[02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:20.411]  Again, we've got General Michael Hayden, who's now the CIA director, who denies that the reasonable cause is the standard of whether you can search and seize.
[02:52:20.471 --> 02:52:22.093]  He denies the Fourth Amendment.
[02:52:22.133 --> 02:52:23.734]  He denies the Fourth Amendment.
[02:52:24.474 --> 02:52:27.716]  You've got the guy that used to run the Honduran death squads.
[02:52:27.776 --> 02:52:28.696]  You used to train them.
[02:52:29.517 --> 02:52:32.538]  John Negroponte is now the Director of National Intelligence.
[02:52:32.939 --> 02:52:36.220]  We find out in America now that torture is wonderful.
[02:52:36.581 --> 02:52:39.942]  It's okay to torture people as long as you redefine the term.
[02:52:40.523 --> 02:52:48.207]  Now the guy who wrote the torture memos, Gonzalez, not Henry Gonzalez, Gonzalez is now the Attorney General
[02:52:49.167 --> 02:52:54.391]  Alberto Gonzalez, the Attorney General of the whole United States, says torture is fine.
[02:52:54.771 --> 02:53:04.237]  You've got the President of the United States claiming that the right-of-line item veto is his, that he can just write a signing statement and blow off any law he doesn't like.
[02:53:04.737 --> 02:53:10.741]  He called, within earshot of several Republicans, he called the Constitution a GD piece of paper.
[02:53:12.122 --> 02:53:14.704]  You know, oil companies' profits are record.
[02:53:15.104 --> 02:53:16.425]  Gas prices have doubled.
[02:53:16.445 --> 02:53:17.366]  You're paying for it.
[02:53:18.032 --> 02:53:20.633]  You've got wholesale outsourcing of American jobs.
[02:53:21.673 --> 02:53:23.414]  They're trying to sell our porch to the Arabs.
[02:53:23.474 --> 02:53:24.094]  Remember that?
[02:53:24.594 --> 02:53:26.875]  The Kelo v. City of New London decision.
[02:53:26.895 --> 02:53:40.379]  They're trying to implement one of the planks of the Communist Manifesto to destroy our private property rights by saying that they can force a private individual to sell his land to another private individual as long as the government gets a kickback.
[02:53:41.039 --> 02:53:43.440]  And all throughout this entire situation...
[02:53:44.196 --> 02:53:44.856]  We're good to go.
[02:53:44.956 --> 02:53:45.356]  I think?
[02:54:07.041 --> 02:54:08.403]  I'm going to get on out of here.
[02:54:08.423 --> 02:54:11.506]  We're going to finish this show with more of Alex in New York.
[02:54:11.986 --> 02:54:13.568]  Thank him for the opportunity to do this.
[02:54:13.948 --> 02:54:15.810]  And we will be back tomorrow.
[02:54:16.711 --> 02:54:17.752]  And God bless you.
[02:54:24.691 --> 02:54:26.292]  How could that happen in America?
[02:54:26.672 --> 02:54:30.075]  How could that be allowed under this administration?
[02:54:30.275 --> 02:54:35.758]  You know how Rudy Giuliani was in charge of it, and yet he was treated like the hero.
[02:54:35.778 --> 02:54:37.920]  Look, you want an indictment?
[02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:39.421]  All it's going to take...
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:41.401]  Is one actionable crime?
[02:54:41.561 --> 02:54:42.902]  There's one right there.
[02:54:43.062 --> 02:54:45.543]  The destruction and removal of evidence.
[02:54:45.563 --> 02:54:47.304]  Building 7 was removed.
[02:54:47.404 --> 02:54:57.169]  All the debris, which was just a small pile, maybe three stories high, which nobody can explain other than controlled demolition, was removed in less than six weeks.
[02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:58.289]  Cleaned out.
[02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:59.730]  Then out of here.
[02:55:00.070 --> 02:55:03.912]  All that's been overseas shipped away to be melted down.
[02:55:04.292 --> 02:55:06.133]  They wanted that evidence gone.
[02:55:07.014 --> 02:55:07.374]  This is
[02:55:08.123 --> 02:55:11.986]  Criminal behavior and cannot be tolerated.
[02:55:12.666 --> 02:55:18.551]  So, folks, what are we going to do about it?
[02:55:19.451 --> 02:55:20.012]  How about this?
[02:55:20.072 --> 02:55:25.956]  Subpoena Silverstein, subpoena Giuliani, subpoena control demolition.
[02:55:26.356 --> 02:55:28.738]  All right?
[02:55:28.778 --> 02:55:29.879]  We can do it, folks.
[02:55:30.572 --> 02:55:33.733]  All we got to do is know the right focus.
[02:55:33.773 --> 02:55:35.094]  There's one of them.
[02:55:35.134 --> 02:55:35.394]  All right?
[02:55:35.414 --> 02:55:36.254]  You know what?
[02:55:36.595 --> 02:55:38.735]  It can all be broken down.
[02:55:38.815 --> 02:55:41.136]  It all has to be broken with just one.
[02:55:42.137 --> 02:55:43.577]  Just one focus.
[02:55:44.938 --> 02:55:54.402]  The destruction, the remodel, the tampering of evidence, which everybody knows, all law enforcement knows, that is criminal and indication of guilt.
[02:55:54.722 --> 02:55:56.343]  But there we have it.
[02:55:56.363 --> 02:55:57.203]  Let's move on.
[02:55:57.223 --> 02:55:58.344]  Let's take pictures of it.
[02:56:01.499 --> 02:56:03.360]  Everybody, let America hear you.
[02:56:03.780 --> 02:56:05.280]  Let the world hear you.
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:06.081]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:06.101 --> 02:56:08.342]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:08.362 --> 02:56:10.903]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:10.923 --> 02:56:13.324]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:13.344 --> 02:56:15.084]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:15.104 --> 02:56:17.525]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:17.545 --> 02:56:19.866]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:19.886 --> 02:56:21.587]  9-11 was an inside job!
[02:56:25.316 --> 02:56:25.897]  We're good to go.
