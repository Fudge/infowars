[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.440]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.160]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.981]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.461]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:13.102]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:17.463]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:22.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:30.747]  Radiating the message of liberty and freedom and resistance to tyranny from Central Texas, Austin, Texas...
[00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:33.008]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:35.989]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:45.034]  I've interviewed her on camera for my documentary film, The Matrix of Evil, but she's never been on the radio broadcast.
[00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:57.141]  She is scheduled, as they say across the pond, in the second hour, Cynthia McKinney, to talk about the Iraq War, to get into the dying core slave rings.
[00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:01.514]  And Halliburton slave rings, the vaccinations, all of it.
[00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:14.466]  She's one of the few congresspersons who is willing to really bring forward the most horrible issues out there that no one wants to face, that people want to ignore and avoid.
[00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:18.230]  So that is scheduled in the next hour.
[00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:23.386]  Masses of news and information in the meantime, and we'll be taking your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:23.887]  Wide open phones.
[00:01:23.907 --> 00:01:24.989]  The websites are...
[00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.053]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and infowars.net.
[00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:35.494]  Check them all out today.
[00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:38.817]  New evidence suggests Muslim riots are staged.
[00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:48.124]  Now everyone's saying it, and just incredible amounts of evidence coming out, even on World Net Daily, one of the more neoconish publications now.
[00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:49.005]  I'm not saying they're all bad.
[00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:49.965]  They still do some good work.
[00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:56.430]  Republican who oversees the NSA calls for wiretap inquiry, but really that's a smokescreen.
[00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.231]  We'll tell you why.
[00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:06.353]  And Americans believe Iran is the biggest threat to the U.S., even though they haven't threatened to nuke us like China and North Korea do, almost on a weekly basis.
[00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:11.455]  I mean, every few weeks I see where North Korea or China threatens to nuke us again, it's just routine.
[00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:13.555]  So I guess between the two of them, it is weekly.
[00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:25.559]  Blair is saying that British troops in Iran, he says we can never say never, same thing he said on the eve of the second Gulf War back in March of 2003.
[00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:36.966]  And USA Today is telling us to expect massive election problems with all the wonderful new touchscreen, no record, proprietary software scam systems.
[00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:38.987]  And they're just telling us that it's no big deal.
[00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:43.289]  Just get ready for, quote, some problems in the elections.
[00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:44.109]  No big deal.
[00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.869]  Go back to sleep.
[00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.291]  Scientists are predicting a mini ice age just out of UPI.
[00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:53.213]  And the Army is demanding... We mentioned this yesterday, but didn't detail it.
[00:02:53.253 --> 00:02:54.013]  We will today.
[00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:55.093]  Army demands $700...
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.082]  From man who was wounded.
[00:03:00.142 --> 00:03:03.724]  Again, because they cut off his shattered body armor from his body.
[00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:06.086]  His shattered body.
[00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.628]  And that's their words.
[00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.669]  And the shattered body armor as well.
[00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.950]  It was all shattered.
[00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:13.984]  Like a Rolling Stones song.
[00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:17.047]  And they're going to charge him for the body armor.
[00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:19.309]  They also charge him $4 per meal.
[00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.652]  Never before done in our history, but hey, that's how you support the troops.
[00:03:22.992 --> 00:03:27.456]  Suck your thumb, watch a football game, and say you support them when you really care less about them.
[00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:30.359]  I'm sorry, I'm getting angry again.
[00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.925]  And now they're saying that the drawings of the Prophet Muhammad, of course, all staged, that it's causing a global crisis.
[00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:41.926]  We have a bunch of other audio clips today that I want to air.
[00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:49.249]  One of them, when we get back in the second segment, here in just a few minutes, reporter hits McClellan on taps.
[00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.089]  That is Scott McClellan, the White House Press Secretary.
[00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.831]  You know what happened to Nixon when he broke the law.
[00:03:55.891 --> 00:04:00.152]  Instead of reading the transcript of the...
[00:04:01.144 --> 00:04:01.985]  We're good to go.
[00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:22.692]  We're good to go.
[00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:50.158]  I might watch conservatively an hour every two weeks or so.
[00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:54.886]  But I do watch a lot in the office on tapes and CDs people send me.
[00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:57.550]  Specific things to analyze them, but not for leisure.
[00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.034]  I'm kind of ashamed of myself for watching three hours of TV.
[00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.408]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:06.411]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:30.268]  We're good.
[00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:51.581]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:52.542]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:05.376]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:07.197]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:12.219]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:19.302]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:06:19.622 --> 00:06:21.603]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:06:21.823 --> 00:06:24.664]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:06:24.764 --> 00:06:29.406]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:34.027]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:41.490]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.151]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:46.052]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:07:01.584 --> 00:07:02.665]  You don't love me anymore.
[00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:04.806]  You used to take such good care of me.
[00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:06.306]  Is that my car talking to me?
[00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:06.747]  Yes.
[00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:07.867]  You neglect me.
[00:07:08.047 --> 00:07:10.028]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:12.870]  Use the cheapest gas.
[00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.091]  I'm getting sick.
[00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:16.572]  One of these days, I'm just going to give up.
[00:07:17.632 --> 00:07:18.113]  Wait a minute.
[00:07:18.213 --> 00:07:19.833]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[00:07:20.053 --> 00:07:28.617]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protective engine treatment, protective transmission treatment, and especially protective complete fuel system treatment.
[00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:34.560]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.161]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[00:07:37.321 --> 00:07:41.984]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[00:07:42.204 --> 00:07:43.865]  I'll always be there for you.
[00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:47.386]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:51.389]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:53.310]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:08:01.754 --> 00:08:03.915]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.475 --> 00:08:07.357]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:24.045]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:24.665]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.026]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:26.046 --> 00:08:26.786]  We're here live.
[00:08:26.866 --> 00:08:28.187]  It's the Genesis Network.
[00:08:28.267 --> 00:08:30.588]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.907]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:50.203]  I tell you, I don't like to get off into side issues about myself personally, but I'm getting more and more tired of people posing as Alex Jones on the internet or individuals claiming they're affiliated with me.
[00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:51.427]  We're good to go.
[00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:51.588]  I think?
[00:09:21.573 --> 00:09:31.037]  We're going to get into new evidence of the staged psyops with the Muslim riots, and it's just piling on top of previous evidence.
[00:09:31.097 --> 00:09:33.558]  I would call it conclusive right now.
[00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:46.343]  Especially just when you look at the response of the media and the way past things have been handled, this has got all the earmarks of a psychological warfare operation, or to use the abbreviation, psyops.
[00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:49.677]  We're good to go.
[00:09:49.697 --> 00:09:49.897]  I think?
[00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:20.854]  I think she's a great champion of covering issues that others are afraid to cover, like the dying core child kidnapping rings.
[00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:26.078]  And so we'll just air some of those congressional clips of her grilling Lord Rumsfeld.
[00:10:26.098 --> 00:10:28.479]  And by the way, those hearings are coming up again in the next few weeks.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.262]  We have the hearings from last March of last year.
[00:10:32.282 --> 00:10:34.864]  And I'm sorry if I harp on this.
[00:10:36.545 --> 00:10:38.927]  In the last six or seven months, I haven't talked much about it, but
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.356]  Lately I've been getting more into it because it's one of the biggest issues out there.
[00:10:45.285 --> 00:11:00.132]  That hundreds of thousands of women and children in one operation were kidnapped and taken to slave camps and used in every manner of evil you can imagine, just from menial labor to sweatshops to sex slaves.
[00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:07.616]  And then some were just adopted out to families, good families that didn't know and just thought they were getting some central or Eastern European child.
[00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:10.777]  And no one ever talks about getting these children or these women back.
[00:11:10.857 --> 00:11:13.779]  It's just, yeah, the government even admits, yeah, that happened.
[00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:15.540]  But we're not going to do anything about it.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.100]  And they've got lobbyists.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.101]  Dying Court and Halliburton have lobbyists inside Congress.
[00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:23.422]  This is, again, I keep mentioning it because it's a big deal.
[00:11:24.002 --> 00:11:36.967]  Chicago Tribune admitting that they have lobbyists there lobbying for the Pentagon and overseas operations not to enforce federal law and start arresting these contractors that are doing this.
[00:11:38.052 --> 00:11:52.121]  Imagine if 200,000 women and children, 200,000 people, two Super Bowl crowds, two football stadiums of 100,000 apiece were grabbed in a giant industrial operation.
[00:11:52.141 --> 00:11:56.143]  I mean, imagine a city of 200,000 people disappearing.
[00:11:56.183 --> 00:11:57.184]  That's a pretty big town.
[00:11:57.204 --> 00:11:58.865]  200,000 people.
[00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.166]  What town in America is 200,000?
[00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:10.876]  Just think of that town, or think of two towns of 100,000, or four towns of 50,000, or think of 20 towns of a couple thousand apiece.
[00:12:17.324 --> 00:12:17.964]  Think about that.
[00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:18.725]  What, 20 towns of 5,000?
[00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:24.186]  Think about all of that happening, and Alex, move on.
[00:12:24.907 --> 00:12:26.747]  We'd like to hear a little bit of Hollywood news.
[00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:27.248]  All right.
[00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:29.388]  I was in the grocery store the other day.
[00:12:29.468 --> 00:12:33.650]  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are expecting.
[00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.630]  She is pregnant.
[00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.831]  Oh, isn't she beautiful?
[00:12:36.351 --> 00:12:38.612]  Brad Pitt's coming up in a new movie.
[00:12:38.912 --> 00:12:42.993]  Incredibly stylish and handsome and smart.
[00:12:43.573 --> 00:12:45.414]  We'll tell you his makeup secrets.
[00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:48.026]  You see, you got the wrong show.
[00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:50.547]  And I'm not trying to sit here and beat people over the head with that.
[00:12:50.947 --> 00:12:52.467]  It's just we're into real issues.
[00:12:52.507 --> 00:12:55.788]  And we do not let the mainstream media set our agenda.
[00:12:56.048 --> 00:13:01.530]  Sometimes the mainstream media is talking about things that I personally think are really important and that you, the listeners, think are important.
[00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.350]  But we steer the show.
[00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.171]  The listeners who call in, our guests who we have on, and yes, yours truly.
[00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.112]  It's kind of a third here, a third there.
[00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:13.432]  The listeners steer about a third of the content.
[00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:14.653]  I steer about a third.
[00:13:14.713 --> 00:13:15.433]  And our guests...
[00:13:16.405 --> 00:13:23.390]  Well, to be frank, I picked the guest, and so I guess in the final equation I steer about two-thirds of the content.
[00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:28.933]  But our guests are always a wild card, too, and we end up having on a lot of guests who we even disagree with.
[00:13:29.594 --> 00:13:32.095]  Now, let me just try to get into the news.
[00:13:32.335 --> 00:13:36.378]  Let me just cover this now so we don't run out of time and never cover it.
[00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:38.319]  This is from the Raw Story.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.981]  It's up on prisonplanet.com right now.
[00:13:41.301 --> 00:13:44.523]  Reporter hints McClellan on taps.
[00:13:44.744 --> 00:13:45.224]  He hits him.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.264]  You know what happened to Nixon when he broke the law.
[00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:51.225]  White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan
[00:13:53.306 --> 00:14:04.697]  In a heated battle with a White House correspondent on Monday's press briefing over President Bush's warrantless domestic spying program, Raw Story has lured.
[00:14:05.157 --> 00:14:15.707]  The questioner, outspoken liberal columnist Helen Thomas, she always does a great job, one of the few real reporters in there, you know, she's on the payroll, has been covering the, that is government payroll,
[00:14:16.508 --> 00:14:24.014]  That he has been covering the White House since President John F. Kennedy asked McClellan if Bush should obey the law.
[00:14:25.135 --> 00:14:27.077]  The relevant part of the transcript follows.
[00:14:27.597 --> 00:14:29.539]  And let's go ahead and roll that.
[00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:29.979]  Here it is.
[00:14:33.562 --> 00:14:34.183]  Pretty good, isn't it?
[00:14:36.084 --> 00:14:38.106]  Folks, we actually have computers from the 1930s.
[00:14:38.146 --> 00:14:39.467]  Okay, that's a joke.
[00:14:39.487 --> 00:14:41.329]  They didn't have computers in the 1930s.
[00:14:41.909 --> 00:14:42.530]  Do we have it now?
[00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:45.670]  We didn't download this?
[00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.591]  Are we just streaming this?
[00:14:46.611 --> 00:14:50.133]  I tell you what, stop right there.
[00:14:50.153 --> 00:14:50.573]  Stop right there.
[00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:51.793]  Let's start it over.
[00:14:52.074 --> 00:14:54.115]  Let's start it over with a big officialdom.
[00:14:54.395 --> 00:15:02.879]  This is White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan being grilled, or just being asked a serious question by Helen Thomas.
[00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:03.839]  Go ahead.
[00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:10.963]  ...to uphold the Constitution...
[00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:15.401]  Wiretapping is not legal under the circumstances without a warrant.
[00:15:15.421 --> 00:15:22.609]  Well, I guess you didn't pay attention to the Attorney General's hearing earlier today because he walked through very clearly the rationale behind this program.
[00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:28.776]  And Helen, I think you have to ask, I think you have to ask, are we, well he's not, are we a nation at war?
[00:15:28.796 --> 00:15:30.839]  That's not the question.
[00:15:30.859 --> 00:15:31.760]  No, that is the issue here.
[00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:35.257]  The point is, there are means for him to go to war.
[00:15:35.617 --> 00:15:37.558]  Get a warrant to spy on people.
[00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:40.479]  Enemy surveillance is critical to waging and winning war.
[00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.740]  It's one of the traditional tools of war.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:54.765]  And the Attorney General outlined very clearly today how previous administrations have used the same authority and cited the very same authority.
[00:15:54.785 --> 00:15:58.686]  And we're going to continue doing everything we can within our power to protect the American people.
[00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:00.887]  This is a very different circumstance, and you know that.
[00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:05.097]  Go ahead.
[00:16:05.177 --> 00:16:13.561]  You should go back and listen to what the Attorney General said because he laid out the safeguards that are in place and how it's the career officials at NSA that make the decisions when it comes to this.
[00:16:14.261 --> 00:16:15.482]  Go ahead.
[00:16:16.022 --> 00:16:16.762]  And he does.
[00:16:20.224 --> 00:16:25.025]  So, now you notice he tries to talk over her and round her out, but here's the question.
[00:16:25.086 --> 00:16:27.587]  Does the President think he should obey the law?
[00:16:28.007 --> 00:16:31.128]  He put his hand on the Bible twice to uphold the Constitution.
[00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:35.888]  Wiretapping is not legal under the circumstances without a warrant.
[00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:47.414]  McClellan, well, I guess you didn't pay attention to the Attorney General's hearing earlier today because he walked through very clearly the rationale behind this program.
[00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:48.555]  By the way, Scott...
[00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:50.845]  And I'm not talking about Scott McClellan.
[00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:52.486]  I'm talking about Scott running the broadcast.
[00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:55.188]  I know you weren't running the show yesterday, but it's in the computer.
[00:16:55.568 --> 00:16:56.488]  We do have a clip.
[00:16:56.628 --> 00:16:58.049]  I should have mentioned this to you before the show.
[00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.510]  Try to find it.
[00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:09.196]  We played yesterday of Attorney General Gonzalez saying two days ago that George Washington engaged in electronic surveillance.
[00:17:09.216 --> 00:17:11.177]  Of course, there was no such thing at the time.
[00:17:12.617 --> 00:17:15.258]  So that's even more ridiculous.
[00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:19.659]  What he sources is his proof of this special wartime power.
[00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:35.462]  Then, of course, we have the clip of the NSA head at the National Press Club meeting, press conference, and he says that the Fourth Amendment has nothing in it about probable cause, and he just says, no, it doesn't.
[00:17:36.522 --> 00:17:38.683]  So I tell you what, grab both those clips.
[00:17:38.723 --> 00:17:39.203]  I want to play them.
[00:17:39.223 --> 00:17:40.503]  Do you have the Attorney General clip?
[00:17:43.436 --> 00:17:45.237]  Yeah, go ahead and roll the Gonzales clip.
[00:17:45.677 --> 00:17:49.599]  This is a clip we played yesterday, and this is from Monday.
[00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:50.419]  Here it is.
[00:17:50.739 --> 00:17:55.782]  225 years' use of the exercise of the power of Commander-in-Chief.
[00:17:55.882 --> 00:18:11.749]  I gave in my opening statement senior examples where President Washington, President Lincoln, President Wilson, President Roosevelt have all authorized electronic surveillance on a far broader scale, without any kind of probable cause.
[00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:15.902]  Yeah, so there you have it, without any type of probable cause.
[00:18:16.143 --> 00:18:24.494]  So, literally, George Washington had satellites, and he had phone lines, and he had echelon, and he just spied on everyone.
[00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:28.980]  That is total baloney.
[00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:31.143]  Total malarkey.
[00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:44.329]  And when we get back from break, I'll play that clip one more time of the former head of the NSA who just stepped down a few months ago at the National Press Club saying that the Fourth Amendment does not say what it says.
[00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.811]  Counting on the public being ignorant and not knowing what's going on.
[00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:55.973]  Now remember, with this whole spying debate, I believe, as many others do, that this was brought forward intentionally.
[00:18:56.013 --> 00:19:00.474]  They bring forward a very small, minuscule part of a giant program
[00:19:01.405 --> 00:19:01.966]  We're good to go.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:29.224]  The Pentagon has active duty soldiers in plain clothes spying on the American people long before George Bush even got into office.
[00:19:29.564 --> 00:19:32.106]  So see, this is this giant long-term program.
[00:19:32.826 --> 00:19:35.668]  So they're going to introduce it to the public by saying, well, hey, we're in a war.
[00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:37.929]  Can't we get Al-Qaeda phone calls into America?
[00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.190]  Why?
[00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.953]  And people go, but the FISA court lets you do that without even having to go get a warrant for 72 hours.
[00:19:46.373 --> 00:19:49.015]  And then you can wait another month after that to even tell them what you were doing.
[00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:51.241]  They just go, well, we're not going to do that.
[00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:51.581]  Why?
[00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:53.482]  They're setting the precedent.
[00:19:53.922 --> 00:19:57.483]  And then having a debate, a false debate, a straw man debate.
[00:19:57.743 --> 00:19:58.423]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.443 --> 00:19:59.143]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.324 --> 00:20:05.304]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:43.786]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:23:07.138 --> 00:23:07.879]  You heard that right.
[00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:10.441]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[00:23:10.701 --> 00:23:11.762]  You don't have to pay them off.
[00:23:11.902 --> 00:23:13.103]  The banks are defrauding you.

[00:24:05.494 --> 00:24:07.035]  This show is documented.
[00:24:07.535 --> 00:24:10.276]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.736 --> 00:24:18.359]  I know I've already heard this twice in the last few weeks, but it's so central.
[00:24:18.439 --> 00:24:21.180]  It's just another amazing illustration.
[00:24:21.949 --> 00:24:34.096]  By the way, we have another clip that I just remembered that we played last week where Bush is saying six months ago or about five months ago that don't worry, the Patriot Act does not affect you.
[00:24:34.136 --> 00:24:37.978]  We've got to have warrants and it doesn't affect American citizens.
[00:24:37.998 --> 00:24:38.898]  There's a law.
[00:24:39.238 --> 00:24:40.539]  We've got to have warrants.
[00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:42.620]  And then months later, I don't need to have a warrant.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:44.041]  We don't need no stinking warrants.
[00:24:44.773 --> 00:24:46.873]  So it's just lying on a daily basis.
[00:24:47.334 --> 00:24:49.254]  Here's the Fourth Amendment.
[00:24:49.294 --> 00:25:07.337]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrant shall be issued but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:10.518]  Now go ahead and roll the clip from Oberman's Countdown.
[00:25:10.558 --> 00:25:10.898]  Here it is.
[00:25:11.693 --> 00:25:28.483]  My understanding is that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution specifies that you must have probable cause to be able to do a search that does not violate an American's right against unlawful searches and seizures.
[00:25:28.843 --> 00:25:30.644]  The Fourth Amendment actually...
[00:25:31.244 --> 00:25:34.627]  It protects all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:25:34.907 --> 00:25:35.968]  That's what it says.
[00:25:35.988 --> 00:25:38.510]  But the measure is probable cause, I believe.
[00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.832]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:42.854]  But does it not say probable... No.
[00:25:43.414 --> 00:25:45.856]  The court says unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:25:45.876 --> 00:25:47.698]  The legal standard is probable cause.
[00:25:48.018 --> 00:25:55.864]  Just to be very clear, and believe me, if there's any amendment to the Constitution that employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with, it's the Fourth.
[00:25:57.465 --> 00:26:00.488]  And it is a reasonable standard in the Fourth Amendment.
[00:26:01.807 --> 00:26:11.814]  To quote the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in its entirety, the one the General and the NSA folks are so familiar with and know is about reasonableness and not about probable cause, quote,
[00:26:12.381 --> 00:26:32.299]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:36.083]  Well, maybe they have a different constitution over there at the NSA.
[00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:43.708]  And then later, if we can find the clip, we'll go ahead and pop that audio down.
[00:26:44.408 --> 00:26:46.849]  Later, if we can find the other clip from last week, there's so many.
[00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:58.453]  We have Bush saying that we have to have warrants, don't worry, we're not spying on you without warrants, and then now they're saying that they don't need that, and that they never needed that, and that the Constitution says they can't.
[00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:01.414]  By the way, guess what the Constitution and common law...
[00:27:02.374 --> 00:27:14.582]  And all of the precedents of the last 200 years, until the last 25 or so, now they've been changing the precedents, but that's a fraud, happens to you in the government if you violate one of the Big Ten.
[00:27:16.103 --> 00:27:26.390]  You are to be tried for treason or sedition, and you are to be executed after you have been found guilty and then given one appeal.
[00:27:27.797 --> 00:27:29.777]  Now, that is what's supposed to happen.
[00:27:29.817 --> 00:27:32.358]  So, by the way, it's not just the federal government.
[00:27:32.378 --> 00:27:36.619]  The local police departments, the state police, all over the country, I've read their handbooks.
[00:27:37.019 --> 00:27:39.400]  Good state police officers have sent me their training manuals.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.900]  And there's nothing bad about doing that.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.120]  It's not classified or anything.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:49.382]  And they tell them, oh, our policy is it's not unreasonable search and seizure, and it's not unreasonable to ask to search and search the car.
[00:27:49.722 --> 00:27:51.842]  And so the cop thinks he's following the Constitution.
[00:27:51.882 --> 00:27:52.943]  He's not a bad person.
[00:27:53.303 --> 00:27:54.123]  He's just ignorant.
[00:27:54.523 --> 00:27:55.344]  But I'm sorry.
[00:27:55.764 --> 00:27:58.066]  Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
[00:27:58.146 --> 00:28:04.091]  Now, in modern times, you really can't expect that because there are tens of millions of laws.
[00:28:04.151 --> 00:28:04.351]  Yes.
[00:28:05.479 --> 00:28:12.601]  The last time I checked, it was over 10 million a few years ago, and supposedly the body of law, if you can believe it, is now doubling roughly every five years.
[00:28:12.641 --> 00:28:13.941]  So it's totally insane.
[00:28:14.141 --> 00:28:20.703]  So obviously, no one can follow all the laws, but the big ones, the Ten Commandments, the Ten Bill of Rights, things like that.
[00:28:20.763 --> 00:28:28.405]  We know what those basic laws are in common law, out of the Mosaic Law, out of the Torah, and then codified in 1215...
[00:28:30.137 --> 00:28:46.269]  With the Magna Carta, and then of course 1776 Declaration of Independence, 1798 and so on, or 1788, all these different dates that are so seminal, that are so central, that are so incredibly important.
[00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:52.894]  Perhaps we should start doing, maybe once or twice a month, an entire broadcast that is Constitution School.
[00:28:53.812 --> 00:28:55.513]  And I could bring the best guest on.
[00:28:55.593 --> 00:28:56.473]  I did this years ago.
[00:28:56.793 --> 00:29:07.616]  I could bring on the George Gordons, and I could bring on the Red Beckmans, and I could bring on all these other experts, you know, the father of the Fully Informed Jury Association, to explain and to go through the actual articles.
[00:29:08.617 --> 00:29:10.977]  You got the head of the NSA just going, no, it doesn't say that.
[00:29:11.037 --> 00:29:11.537]  No, it doesn't.
[00:29:11.657 --> 00:29:12.178]  No, it doesn't.
[00:29:13.158 --> 00:29:15.139]  Well, it doesn't just say you've got to have probable cause.
[00:29:15.179 --> 00:29:16.599]  It says what probable cause is.
[00:29:16.899 --> 00:29:19.800]  First, it says in the Fourth Amendment...
[00:29:20.666 --> 00:29:22.207]  No unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:29:22.287 --> 00:29:23.768]  Then it tells you what's reasonable.
[00:29:24.688 --> 00:29:26.689]  Okay, it tells you you've got to have probable cause.
[00:29:26.709 --> 00:29:28.070]  And it says, what is probable cause?
[00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:35.574]  It's a sworn oath with somebody who's going public, particularly saying what it is that you've done wrong and what they're looking for.
[00:29:36.695 --> 00:29:38.556]  Okay, so it's more than what the reporter said.
[00:29:38.796 --> 00:29:40.517]  It's an even higher standard.
[00:29:41.252 --> 00:29:44.174]  Because the Founding Fathers knew that government had to be restrained.
[00:29:44.194 --> 00:29:48.358]  It's the most dangerous force of man on the earth ever.
[00:29:48.398 --> 00:29:48.858]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.898 --> 00:29:49.459]  Tons of news.
[00:29:49.479 --> 00:29:50.439]  Your calls are dead.
[00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:52.761]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.242 --> 00:29:54.843]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.863 --> 00:29:58.446]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:03.139]  We're good to go.
[00:30:27.219 --> 00:30:45.491]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:50.135]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:30:50.356 --> 00:30:51.296]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:51.477 --> 00:30:53.118]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:30:53.238 --> 00:30:55.020]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:55.761]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:30:55.801 --> 00:30:55.981]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:31:03.107 --> 00:31:08.071]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.

[00:31:10.693 --> 00:31:18.159]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:31:18.499 --> 00:31:21.521]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:25.264]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:31:25.584 --> 00:31:34.931]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:35.192 --> 00:31:38.694]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:38.934 --> 00:31:46.040]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.503]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.772]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:32:04.132 --> 00:32:08.076]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:11.961]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:32:12.361 --> 00:32:15.905]  I was presented with the opportunity to try TriVibes from TriVortex.
[00:32:16.305 --> 00:32:21.171]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them
[00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:27.296]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:32:27.596 --> 00:32:33.741]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever, not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:32:34.061 --> 00:32:39.846]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:32:40.266 --> 00:32:41.446]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:32:41.767 --> 00:32:42.867]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:32:42.967 --> 00:32:48.389]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[00:32:48.589 --> 00:32:52.050]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.631]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:53.951]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:33:11.825 --> 00:33:15.489]  Alright, your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:17.812]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:18.533 --> 00:33:26.503]  Let me just talk a little bit more about the spying and play that clip of Bush where he says...
[00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:48.523]  Just late last year, I guess this was about five months ago, when he was out stumping for the repassage of the Patriot Act, a campaign that continues, and they want to beef it up, of course, for a new federal police force, felony time for absolutely no reason, quote, if anything is disruptive, including a sign anywhere they wish, even if no, quote, government officials are there of any type.
[00:33:48.783 --> 00:33:56.225]  They can just say, you can't be here, and then if you don't move quick enough, you spend a year or more in federal prison as a terrorist.
[00:33:56.525 --> 00:33:57.066]  We're good to go.
[00:33:57.086 --> 00:33:57.266]  I think?
[00:34:21.927 --> 00:34:26.650]  You are followed in, and if you don't leave immediately at these, quote, open forums, you are arrested.
[00:34:28.271 --> 00:34:30.193]  So, again, that's our free society right there.
[00:34:30.213 --> 00:34:36.417]  At every one of these forums, no one is allowed in unless they sign little statements swearing that they're a Bush supporter.
[00:34:36.577 --> 00:34:46.503]  But then on the nightly news, they tell you that it's just a town hall and that it's real questions, and they have staged questioners who've already been vetted and are normally Republican Party leaders in the area.
[00:34:46.743 --> 00:34:49.425]  It's all totally staged, just like the Soviet Union.
[00:34:49.665 --> 00:34:51.026]  Let's go ahead and roll Lord Bush.
[00:34:51.747 --> 00:34:52.528]  I'm not a lawyer.
[00:34:53.709 --> 00:34:56.511]  So it's kind of hard for me to kind of get bogged down in the law.
[00:34:56.551 --> 00:35:02.815]  I'm not going to play like one either.
[00:35:04.756 --> 00:35:14.984]  So the first thing I want you to think about is when you hear Patriot Act is that we changed the law and bureaucratic mindset to allow for the sharing of information.
[00:35:15.084 --> 00:35:15.644]  It's vital.
[00:35:15.764 --> 00:35:17.605]  And others will describe what that means.
[00:35:18.806 --> 00:35:19.247]  Secondly,
[00:35:20.612 --> 00:35:22.914]  There are such things as roving wiretaps.
[00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:31.940]  Now, by the way, anytime you hear the United States government talking about wiretap, a wiretap requires a court order.
[00:35:33.541 --> 00:35:35.123]  Nothing has changed, by the way.
[00:35:35.763 --> 00:35:40.647]  When we're talking about chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order before we do so.
[00:35:41.868 --> 00:35:47.792]  It's important for our fellow citizens to understand, when you think Patriot Act, constitutional guarantees are in place.
[00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:52.433]  Are you going to order a leaks investigation into the disclosure of the NSA surveillance program?
[00:35:52.473 --> 00:35:56.895]  And why did you skip the basic safeguard of asking courts for permission?
[00:36:17.381 --> 00:36:22.225]  Now, see, now it cuts to, in this montage, it cuts to two weeks ago.
[00:36:22.725 --> 00:36:24.226]  Keep rolling it, please.
[00:36:25.407 --> 00:36:31.832]  Why did you skip the basic safeguards of asking courts for permission for the intercepts?
[00:36:31.872 --> 00:36:33.053]  We use FISA still.
[00:36:33.433 --> 00:36:35.275]  You're referring to the FISA court in your question.
[00:36:35.295 --> 00:36:36.176]  Of course we use FISA.
[00:36:37.336 --> 00:36:39.298]  But FISA is for long-term monitoring.
[00:36:39.338 --> 00:36:44.382]  What is needed in order to protect the American people is the ability to move quickly to detect.
[00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:50.587]  Having suggested this idea, I then obviously went to the question, is it legal to do so?
[00:36:50.607 --> 00:36:54.409]  I swore to uphold the laws.
[00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.011]  Do I have the legal authority to do this?
[00:36:59.452 --> 00:37:00.932]  And the answer is absolutely.
[00:37:02.213 --> 00:37:06.916]  As I mentioned in my remarks, the legal authority is derived from the Constitution.
[00:37:07.962 --> 00:37:11.085]  As well as the authorization of force by the United States Congress.
[00:37:11.265 --> 00:37:11.625]  Okay.
[00:37:12.265 --> 00:37:12.686]  That's enough.
[00:37:12.746 --> 00:37:13.426]  It goes on and on.
[00:37:13.446 --> 00:37:19.131]  You can watch the video clip montage up there on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:37:20.552 --> 00:37:21.773]  But to try to even...
[00:37:23.556 --> 00:37:32.063]  To try even to begin to cover all the lies, that's why I start talking faster and faster and stumbling over myself and tumbling over myself because how do you cover it all?
[00:37:32.103 --> 00:37:37.548]  It's like trying to count every grain of sand when you go to Cocoa Beach.
[00:37:37.648 --> 00:37:39.950]  I mean, it just isn't going to happen.
[00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:41.612]  It's all lies.
[00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:47.637]  Last night, I got home about 11 o'clock, took a shower, got in the bed.
[00:37:48.037 --> 00:37:49.258]  Why am I giving all the details?
[00:37:49.278 --> 00:37:50.159]  That's just how my brain works.
[00:37:50.965 --> 00:37:52.807]  And I think, you know, I'm going to watch television.
[00:37:52.827 --> 00:37:53.787]  I'm going to watch some news.
[00:37:54.008 --> 00:37:57.530]  And I only watch TV online or I read the synopsis.
[00:37:58.011 --> 00:38:08.179]  I can read the synopsis, basically the condensed version of 30, 40 newscasts in just 45 minutes or so, whereas it would take hours to watch it.
[00:38:08.379 --> 00:38:14.684]  That's why I really don't watch TV is because I can learn the basics or read the transcripts of what they said or get to the meat and potatoes a lot quicker.
[00:38:16.124 --> 00:38:17.445]  I think TV is very destructive.
[00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:25.993]  The major scientific studies out there, there's just masses of them show it's very bad for you cognitively, for critical thinking, but that's a whole other issue.
[00:38:27.154 --> 00:38:28.735]  I'm just making excuses.
[00:38:28.856 --> 00:38:30.297]  Frankly, I just wanted to watch TV.
[00:38:30.697 --> 00:38:41.287]  So I turned the television on, and I'm flipping around, and PBS2 here locally had Dick Cheney talking to Jim
[00:38:43.238 --> 00:38:43.918]  What's his name?
[00:38:44.178 --> 00:38:47.660]  It used to be Jim Lehrer.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.841]  And he's on there talking to him.
[00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.502]  It had to be like a 30-minute interview.
[00:38:52.522 --> 00:38:55.723]  At least from the time I tuned in, it was about 30 minutes long.
[00:38:56.183 --> 00:38:57.884]  And I was looking at a psychopath.
[00:38:58.604 --> 00:39:01.385]  I was looking at a war profiter.
[00:39:01.445 --> 00:39:06.527]  I was looking at somebody who protects Halliburton, openly involved in white slavery.
[00:39:07.629 --> 00:39:16.452]  I was looking at somebody who I know is a total criminal trying to destroy this country who was intimately involved in the attacks of 9-11.
[00:39:17.393 --> 00:39:19.714]  And then I remembered why I really don't watch TV.
[00:39:20.134 --> 00:39:27.897]  I don't like looking at them smirking and smiling and doing all their mafioso clicks and ticks that they do.
[00:39:30.044 --> 00:39:31.826]  And he is just so scary.
[00:39:31.846 --> 00:39:33.487]  He's even scarier than Rumsfeld.
[00:39:33.827 --> 00:39:45.056]  And I just sat there looking at him, and he lied for ten minutes about the wiretaps, and then he lied for ten minutes about the Iraq War, and then he lied for ten minutes about Iran, and it was just...
[00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.939]  Nothing but softballs in a staged event.
[00:39:49.699 --> 00:40:01.487]  They're doing an interview with him, I guess, at the Naval Observatory where Dick Cheney lives part of the time when he's not in a bunker at Site R. Dr. Evil literally running the government.
[00:40:03.448 --> 00:40:05.429]  Because George Bush runs absolutely nothing.
[00:40:05.449 --> 00:40:11.253]  And then I tuned into CNN and I watched Fox and I flipped around and frankly, folks...
[00:40:12.736 --> 00:40:15.598]  It was just nothing but distractions and diversions or lies.
[00:40:16.158 --> 00:40:19.820]  And I don't know how anybody can just sit here and watch it and go along with it.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:29.624]  But so many Americans just look at somebody's body language or what their tie looks like or how good looking is the info, babe, reading off the teleprompter.
[00:40:29.964 --> 00:40:36.487]  And if they deliver it in a calm and focused, deliberative fashion, then it must be true.
[00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.088]  And folks, it ain't true.
[00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:40.389]  It's literally all lies.
[00:40:40.929 --> 00:40:45.793]  Lies on top of lies on top of lies on top of lies on top of lies.
[00:40:46.594 --> 00:40:53.240]  Alberto Gonzalez saying that George Washington didn't follow the Fourth Amendment and used electronic wiretaps on people.
[00:40:54.381 --> 00:41:02.388]  I mean, does Alberto Gonzalez think that George Washington had a telephone or maybe an iPod or a Hewlett Packard laptop?
[00:41:03.148 --> 00:41:06.171]  Maybe George Washington had an Air Force One 777 and flew around.
[00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:06.832]  I mean, it's just...
[00:41:09.156 --> 00:41:17.502]  And then also, Bush, in his State of the Union, said that our country's always been about helping the world and going into 130-something countries.
[00:41:17.823 --> 00:41:21.486]  That's the complete opposite for the first 100 years of America.
[00:41:21.526 --> 00:41:22.366]  You didn't do that.
[00:41:22.987 --> 00:41:24.688]  You didn't go running around the world.
[00:41:24.708 --> 00:41:31.253]  All of that really changed in 1898, when you can really see the imperialism begin with the Spanish-American War.
[00:41:32.134 --> 00:41:34.475]  Bush says he models himself, he told his biographer in 1999,
[00:41:36.281 --> 00:41:37.642]  Even before he was president.
[00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:41.845]  But when he had aspirations of it, he said, I modeled myself off of William McKinley.
[00:41:42.185 --> 00:41:43.826]  Folks, you better learn about William McKinley.
[00:41:44.707 --> 00:41:46.948]  The fellow blew up the main in Havana Harbor.
[00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.970]  And now that's admitted.
[00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:54.133]  Even the Northwoods document, the Army says we can blow up a ship again like we did in 1898.
[00:41:54.633 --> 00:41:56.855]  I mean, it never stops.
[00:41:57.155 --> 00:41:58.356]  It never ends.
[00:41:58.576 --> 00:42:01.558]  It's the same thing over and over.
[00:42:01.878 --> 00:42:02.739]  And over again.
[00:42:02.759 --> 00:42:07.144]  And we've got a general public, at least a large part of it, who thinks you're part of the system.
[00:42:07.164 --> 00:42:11.829]  You think you're taking over Iraq, or you're going to be beating up Iran.
[00:42:11.869 --> 00:42:17.915]  You watch TV and get some personal satisfaction on console and radio, because that's what I really listen to is radio, and I listen to it a lot.
[00:42:18.757 --> 00:42:23.900]  Just when I'm doing work around the office or I'm driving in the car, or I'll even have the headphones on when I'm in the grocery store, whatever.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.323]  I listen to hours and hours every day to monitor the fake propaganda.
[00:42:27.543 --> 00:42:32.186]  The propaganda that's meant to neutralize conservatives and to keep you from saving this country.
[00:42:32.206 --> 00:42:37.069]  Because Lord knows the liberals don't know their head from a hole in the ground and don't know the Constitution.
[00:42:37.529 --> 00:42:40.251]  They think socialism is going to save them, which the bankers just love.
[00:42:42.692 --> 00:42:46.495]  And you listen to the lies, it is very slick.
[00:42:47.859 --> 00:42:52.401]  And they get up there, and they tell you what's conservative, but it really isn't.
[00:42:53.382 --> 00:42:55.082]  An example is this flat tax.
[00:42:55.603 --> 00:43:02.986]  They tell you how great a flat tax would be and how wonderful it would be and how you're going to keep more of your money and it's going to make the federal government lose its power.
[00:43:03.026 --> 00:43:07.708]  And, oh, look, the Washington Post is now pushing a flat tax, a fair tax, as they call it.
[00:43:07.748 --> 00:43:11.790]  And, oh, all these conservative pundits are pushing it, and they're writing books about it.
[00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:13.571]  Funny little thing happened, though.
[00:43:13.631 --> 00:43:15.452]  Ten years ago, my listeners know this.
[00:43:15.472 --> 00:43:16.833]  You've been listening for 12, some of you.
[00:43:17.213 --> 00:43:19.975]  Ten years ago, I discovered the big think tank documents.
[00:43:20.055 --> 00:43:22.397]  In fact, when I get time, I'm going to dig those up.
[00:43:22.417 --> 00:43:23.818]  I'm sure there's more out there now.
[00:43:24.178 --> 00:43:27.160]  I'm going to codify them, write an article, or give it to Paul Watson or his brother.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:27.920]  They'll write an article.
[00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:30.102]  We'll collaborate on that.
[00:43:31.644 --> 00:43:32.344]  This is how it works.
[00:43:32.384 --> 00:43:32.945]  I call him up.
[00:43:33.005 --> 00:43:33.965]  I email him some documents.
[00:43:34.005 --> 00:43:35.126]  I say, do some more research on this.
[00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:35.967]  Put an article together.
[00:43:36.427 --> 00:43:37.908]  And we've got the same analytical skills.
[00:43:37.988 --> 00:43:40.990]  So it's as if I wrote the article and Paul writes it.
[00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.632]  And I can just literally for two minutes go, prepare for transmission.
[00:43:44.872 --> 00:43:46.573]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:43:46.613 --> 00:43:47.473]  He doesn't even write notes.
[00:43:47.513 --> 00:43:48.934]  He just goes, researches it.
[00:43:48.974 --> 00:43:50.435]  If he disagrees with something, he'll call me up.
[00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:51.376]  We'll discuss it.
[00:43:51.456 --> 00:43:53.357]  In fact, I wanted to read this email.
[00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:54.157]  And then we'll go to your calls.
[00:43:54.177 --> 00:43:55.298]  But this is the same thing as a call.
[00:43:55.318 --> 00:43:56.919]  I'm going to get into flat tax in a minute.
[00:43:59.153 --> 00:44:02.896]  Because we're literally in a warfare mode.
[00:44:02.956 --> 00:44:04.117]  We're battling, folks.
[00:44:04.557 --> 00:44:10.082]  It's as if we're anti-aircraft gunners and there's just streams of attack craft coming as we're just blasting them out of the air.
[00:44:10.302 --> 00:44:11.183]  Because we have the truth.
[00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:17.468]  We can decipher, decode, break down everything the globalists are doing.
[00:44:17.728 --> 00:44:20.851]  It's all right out in the open for those that know how the New World Order operates.
[00:44:21.571 --> 00:44:22.052]  Dear Alex...
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.662]  This is the kind of email I like because they really get it.
[00:44:25.722 --> 00:44:26.602]  They really get it.
[00:44:26.662 --> 00:44:27.343]  I mean, I always wonder.
[00:44:27.383 --> 00:44:29.364]  I go, do the listeners really know what it's like around here?
[00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:30.585]  We are scrambling.
[00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:31.205]  That is the word.
[00:44:31.225 --> 00:44:32.206]  We are scurrying.
[00:44:32.246 --> 00:44:33.007]  We are frantic.
[00:44:33.027 --> 00:44:41.633]  We are, quote, I get onto your site several times a day and see how busy you guys are keeping it up to date and keeping the fight alive.
[00:44:41.933 --> 00:44:43.534]  The site is continually updated.
[00:44:43.574 --> 00:44:49.578]  I can just feel you guys behind the scenes scrambling around, constantly working to get the information out.
[00:44:50.857 --> 00:44:55.424]  I just want to thank you and your team for being there and performing the vital work you are doing.
[00:44:55.484 --> 00:44:59.990]  It means a lot to me personally to be kept informed by you on a routine basis.
[00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:04.156]  You're always there and I really appreciate it and I don't just sit around...
[00:45:06.167 --> 00:45:10.271]  Inflowing data while sitting on my behind feeling shocked about it all.
[00:45:10.672 --> 00:45:19.160]  I get out there and use your materials to wake others up, mainly people who are already in disagreement with the way things are in the world and who are willing to do something about it.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:19.681]  Amen.
[00:45:20.101 --> 00:45:20.942]  That's right.
[00:45:21.222 --> 00:45:24.125]  Don't go for the pigs, folks.
[00:45:24.145 --> 00:45:25.867]  Don't put your pearls before slime.
[00:45:25.887 --> 00:45:26.968]  Move on to those that want to know.
[00:45:27.657 --> 00:45:29.538]  Definition of price of freedom, he says.
[00:45:29.638 --> 00:45:32.279]  Constant alertness, constant willingness to fight back.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.840]  There is no other price.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:39.563]  You are paying that price and making others see that they need to pay it too.
[00:45:39.863 --> 00:45:41.324]  Thank you, sincerely, Craig.
[00:45:41.344 --> 00:45:43.065]  No, thank you, Craig, because you get it.
[00:45:43.085 --> 00:45:47.027]  I mean, you know what it's like to do all this research, to constantly work.
[00:45:48.448 --> 00:45:50.089]  On average, about 16 hours a day.
[00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:52.070]  For a while, I was only doing 10 hours a day.
[00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.071]  I'd cut back for a few months because I didn't want to burn out.
[00:45:54.091 --> 00:46:00.354]  But before that, it was 18 hours a day, seven days a week, just insanely working with the aid of two cups of coffee a day.
[00:46:00.374 --> 00:46:00.714]  That's it.
[00:46:02.094 --> 00:46:03.655]  Because I know the threat we're under.
[00:46:03.735 --> 00:46:04.776]  I know the imminence.
[00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:06.576]  I know how serious and systematic.
[00:46:06.817 --> 00:46:08.157]  I know how evil they are.
[00:46:08.998 --> 00:46:12.099]  It's like a bunch of zombies in Day of the Dead trying to bust down your door.
[00:46:12.299 --> 00:46:13.139]  That's the analogy.
[00:46:13.259 --> 00:46:13.720]  I see them.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.560]  They're clearly there.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.461]  This threat is clearly happening.
[00:46:17.568 --> 00:46:21.410]  And other people are just going about their business like they don't even see it around them.
[00:46:22.591 --> 00:46:25.053]  I mean, it's just totally Twilight Zone.
[00:46:25.073 --> 00:46:30.316]  And then imagine talking to some arrogant liberal who doesn't have any facts or info.
[00:46:30.336 --> 00:46:38.841]  They just have their emotional view, their emotional opinion, based in no fact, and you're trying to wake them up about how big government really helps the elite and isn't good.
[00:46:39.101 --> 00:46:41.262]  Or you try to talk to a neocon, they're even worse now.
[00:46:43.777 --> 00:46:44.557]  They're even worse.
[00:46:44.938 --> 00:47:03.006]  You go, but listen, the troops, they're feeding them rotten meals, and they charge them $4 a meal, even when they're in the hospital, and they charge them for a prosthesis when their legs get blown off, and they charge them for body armor, and they're putting the troops into their fifth tour just started, and no army's ever made their soldiers fight more than one tour.
[00:47:04.027 --> 00:47:05.907]  And they just go, no, it's a lie.
[00:47:05.987 --> 00:47:06.348]  Shut up.
[00:47:06.388 --> 00:47:06.908]  It's not true.
[00:47:08.243 --> 00:47:10.104]  Or some will say, yeah, it's true, so what?
[00:47:10.344 --> 00:47:11.505]  You just don't care about the troops.
[00:47:11.545 --> 00:47:12.826]  I go, no, I care about them.
[00:47:13.566 --> 00:47:17.309]  You don't talk bad about George W. Yeah, but Halliburton's abusing him.
[00:47:17.509 --> 00:47:18.489]  Oh, shut up.
[00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:20.591]  Get the bleep out of here.
[00:47:20.611 --> 00:47:27.275]  I've got all this video of these guys out at Crawford that I'm putting in this new film where they're just horrible people.
[00:47:27.475 --> 00:47:29.536]  They're just horrible, horrible people.
[00:47:30.196 --> 00:47:31.677]  And they just don't care.
[00:47:31.777 --> 00:47:32.918]  And they just deny.
[00:47:32.938 --> 00:47:36.220]  They deny the troops have got to pay for their own body armor.
[00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:38.184]  And that's right, folks.
[00:47:38.204 --> 00:47:39.685]  They have to pay for Level 3.
[00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:41.286]  They have to buy their own.
[00:47:41.306 --> 00:47:42.627]  They should all have Level 3.
[00:47:43.388 --> 00:47:45.429]  Level 1 or 2 is almost worthless.
[00:47:46.009 --> 00:47:47.451]  I mean, shrapnel goes through it.
[00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:51.093]  A .22 closed shuffle will go through Level 1 or 2.
[00:47:51.594 --> 00:47:57.798]  You've got to have the Level 3 with the breastplate, the backplate, the neck guards.
[00:47:58.179 --> 00:48:02.582]  I mean, if you're going to be riding around in a tank with your head out the top, or you're going to be in deep trouble.
[00:48:04.173 --> 00:48:12.416]  And so, I mean, I know the families, gung-ho families who had to mail Level 3 to their sons and daughters.
[00:48:12.536 --> 00:48:17.238]  And then I hear the neocons on the radio going, it's not true, they've all been given body armor.
[00:48:17.619 --> 00:48:18.319]  No, it's not.
[00:48:18.679 --> 00:48:21.980]  I hear Rumsfeld say, they've got thousands of armored Humvees.
[00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:30.844]  Yeah, they won't let the troops have it because all the scumbag officers keep it to drive around even inside the fortified citadels, the fortified keeps, the green zones.
[00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:34.175]  And then I hear, oh, it's not true.
[00:48:34.215 --> 00:48:37.325]  It's a liberal lie that they have to pay for their own body armor.
[00:48:37.988 --> 00:48:39.172]  Imagine, you're shattered.
[00:48:40.063 --> 00:48:48.728]  You've got broken collarbones, shrapnel, your face has been blown off, your arms halfway blown off, your fingers are blown off, you've got shrapnel in your intestines.
[00:48:49.108 --> 00:49:02.636]  They cut the shattered body armor, the crummy level 2 that wasn't even level 2 because it was some neocon scammer who sent him garbage so he could throw his daughter $20 million birthday parties, literally.
[00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:05.949]  They're shattered and they cut this off of them.
[00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:14.071]  And then, once they get to Rammstein, I know the family's putting the money together, they have to fly back their own children, in many cases.
[00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:19.972]  And then you get a $700 bill on top of $4 a day for your stinking food!
[00:49:20.132 --> 00:49:23.293]  Now listen to me, you scum neocon listeners.
[00:49:23.573 --> 00:49:27.514]  Listen to me, the trash that listens to all the lies of the lying neocons.
[00:49:27.794 --> 00:49:29.214]  Listen to me, wake up!
[00:49:29.354 --> 00:49:31.094]  Stop being imbeciles!
[00:49:31.515 --> 00:49:33.335]  Stop being mindless scum!
[00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:40.737]  You support the troops by letting them have their food paid for and getting them level 3 body armor.
[00:49:41.718 --> 00:49:43.761]  What is your major malfunction?
[00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:45.703]  What is your problem?
[00:49:46.244 --> 00:49:47.846]  What is wrong with you idiots?
[00:49:49.247 --> 00:49:50.188]  I'm sick of you!
[00:49:51.049 --> 00:49:53.272]  I'm sorry, I promised I wouldn't start ranting and raving today.
[00:49:53.392 --> 00:49:53.853]  I am just...
[00:49:55.682 --> 00:50:05.287]  I hear them on the talk radio, and every time I don't have energy, it could be 10 o'clock at night, I can go out to the car, drive to the local store to buy some bottled water, and just turn on a Neocon.
[00:50:05.527 --> 00:50:11.690]  And within five minutes, I have got energy, because I just hear the lying, scum, lie.
[00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:12.771]  Take the fair tax.
[00:50:14.073 --> 00:50:15.194]  I read about it ten years ago.
[00:50:15.214 --> 00:50:15.595]  That's the plan.
[00:50:36.306 --> 00:50:43.689]  And believe me, the scum pushing it on talk radio knows what they're doing and they must laugh with their buddies how they're setting a trap for you.
[00:50:43.889 --> 00:50:45.430]  Oh, you won't listen to me, though.
[00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:54.754]  And in five years, when you get a flat tax, maybe me in two or three, and when you're paying and you're swiping and you're getting scammed, you'll call me and tell me I was right as usual.
[00:50:54.974 --> 00:50:56.715]  I'd rather you know I was right right now!
[00:50:59.315 --> 00:51:03.659]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:08.284]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:08.424 --> 00:51:12.768]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:12.828 --> 00:51:14.190]  The New World Order.
[00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:20.192]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:20.252 --> 00:51:27.174]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:27.294 --> 00:51:29.354]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:29.674 --> 00:51:39.977]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:40.317 --> 00:51:42.858]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then mind you,
[00:51:42.938 --> 00:51:43.178]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:43.198 --> 00:51:44.240]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:00.581 --> 00:52:11.853]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:52:12.073 --> 00:52:18.520]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.421]  We're good to go.
[00:52:36.937 --> 00:52:37.397]  We're good to go.
[00:52:37.437 --> 00:52:38.038]  We're good to go.
[00:52:38.118 --> 00:52:38.678]  We're good to go.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.922]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:06.162 --> 00:53:08.403]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:08.603 --> 00:53:14.965]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:15.305 --> 00:53:15.946]  We're good to go.
[00:53:30.856 --> 00:53:31.256]  We're good to go.
[00:54:08.347 --> 00:54:11.673]  By the way, this happens a lot with congressmen and women.
[00:54:12.334 --> 00:54:14.638]  Ron Paul's rescheduled before or so has...
[00:54:15.729 --> 00:54:16.589]  Bob Barr and others.
[00:54:17.049 --> 00:54:18.770]  Cynthia McKinney's office just called.
[00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:29.293]  She was, of course, out of her normal office, flying back from Atlanta for the Mrs. King funeral yesterday, back to D.C., and there's been some plane problem.
[00:54:29.653 --> 00:54:39.136]  And instead of trying to get her on for five, ten minutes at the airport today, we'll try to get her on for the full hour tomorrow, which she agreed to do, so she's scheduled now for tomorrow.
[00:54:39.156 --> 00:54:40.176]  But that's fine.
[00:54:40.196 --> 00:54:42.797]  We can play the clip of her talking about the white slavery rings.
[00:54:43.397 --> 00:54:45.978]  And then just take more of your calls, because we've already gotten behind.
[00:54:46.299 --> 00:54:47.639]  And then she's scheduled for tomorrow.
[00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:50.061]  We'll see if that happens with all their traveling.
[00:54:50.101 --> 00:54:52.062]  But she's coming on here one way or the other.
[00:54:52.482 --> 00:54:54.723]  And, of course, you can see the interview I did with her on videotape.
[00:54:55.143 --> 00:55:01.126]  And I was giving speeches with her at the Project Sinford Awards in 2004, where I got second place there.
[00:55:01.667 --> 00:55:03.568]  But side issue, that's in the film Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:04.068 --> 00:55:05.208]  So we'll get to all your calls.
[00:55:05.448 --> 00:55:08.170]  And listen, if I get angry at the neocons and start screaming at them,
[00:55:09.136 --> 00:55:10.077]  I know it's abnormal.
[00:55:10.157 --> 00:55:15.241]  I should yell and scream about the football games, and if my team loses and get upset about that, then I'd be normal.
[00:55:15.841 --> 00:55:28.050]  If I yell and scream about the troops wearing defective Level 2 body armor and being killed or having to pay for their own body armor and then having to pay for it when they cut it off of you, I shouldn't get upset about that.
[00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:30.212]  I understand, and for that I apologize.
[00:55:30.985 --> 00:55:37.670]  I shouldn't get upset about DU killing the troops and causing the birth defects to more than triple now in their children.
[00:55:37.711 --> 00:55:38.972]  That's the Fed's own numbers.
[00:55:39.412 --> 00:55:41.273]  Shouldn't worry about that.
[00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:49.380]  Because supporting the troops means forgetting them and not really caring about them and just supporting the war and the chicken hawk warmongers who've never been in battle.
[00:55:50.752 --> 00:55:51.353]  We're good to go.
[00:55:51.373 --> 00:55:51.513]  I think?
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.444]  All three of my Police State films for $49.95.
[00:56:13.804 --> 00:56:15.787]  That's a savings of over $25.
[00:56:16.147 --> 00:56:28.501]  We have the Terror USA special, Martial Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, three hours long, three films in one, and 9-1-1 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA, 511-page book by Webster Tarpley, $29.95, normally $43.90.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.366]  I mean, Martial Law is $24.95 by itself, so $29.95, you get that huge book with all the graphs and documents in it for $5 more.
[00:56:40.066 --> 00:56:49.854]  Also, we have the four DVD blowout, my four newest and best DVDs, Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, American Dictators, Order of Death.
[00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:52.156]  It's all there.
[00:56:52.256 --> 00:56:54.998]  And on Order of Death, you get a whole other film.
[00:56:56.767 --> 00:56:59.888]  You get a whole other film when you get The Order of Death.
[00:56:59.908 --> 00:57:04.610]  You get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, the updated version on the same DVD.
[00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:08.751]  We have the Codex Magicka by Tex Mars special with The Order of Death together.
[00:57:09.571 --> 00:57:13.273]  And normally $59.90, but now it's $45.95.
[00:57:14.033 --> 00:57:15.373]  Just so many specials.
[00:57:15.393 --> 00:57:16.374]  There's three pages of them.
[00:57:16.434 --> 00:57:19.675]  I didn't even read the first page of specials there.
[00:57:21.215 --> 00:57:23.738]  Go to Infowars.com, to the video and bookstore.
[00:57:23.918 --> 00:57:25.720]  Look at the three pages of specials.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:30.985]  Look at all the other great books and videos we're carrying, like Powder Burns, Cocaine Contras, and The Drug War.

[00:58:58.685 --> 00:58:59.806]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.447 --> 00:59:01.267]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.028 --> 00:59:02.909]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.609 --> 00:59:07.312]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.772 --> 00:59:11.895]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.035 --> 00:59:13.336]  Music
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.482]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:23.562 --> 00:59:24.103]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:24.123 --> 00:59:25.284]  Central Standard Time.
[00:59:25.685 --> 00:59:26.686]  We're here live, folks.
[00:59:26.726 --> 00:59:27.667]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:59:27.687 --> 00:59:30.990]  I know we've been holding patiently, and then I want to get into a major poll.
[00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:34.094]  Majority of Americans think Iran's the biggest threat.
[00:59:34.894 --> 00:59:35.815]  Just total idiots.
[00:59:36.736 --> 00:59:37.297]  That's not true.
[00:59:37.337 --> 00:59:39.880]  Just misinformed, brainwashed, propagandized.
[00:59:41.014 --> 00:59:43.917]  Beijing is reacting to Pentagon reports saying, we're not a threat to you.
[00:59:43.977 --> 00:59:45.258]  How dare you say we're a threat?
[00:59:45.278 --> 00:59:48.921]  There's just so much more coming up in this hour.
[00:59:49.381 --> 00:59:59.650]  More new developments showing that the rioting going on over the Muslim cartoons of Muhammad in Western papers is a psy-op or psychological warfare op that's coming up.
[01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:02.051]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in California.
[01:00:02.071 --> 01:00:02.932]  David, thanks for holding.
[01:00:02.952 --> 01:00:03.373]  Go ahead.
[01:00:04.113 --> 01:00:05.454]  Hey, no sweat, Alex.
[01:00:05.534 --> 01:00:08.637]  Hey, just real quick, one thing I definitely want to say to you, my man.
[01:00:09.198 --> 01:00:10.158]  Don't ever change.
[01:00:10.318 --> 01:00:12.599]  You know, go on your rants.
[01:00:12.939 --> 01:00:20.761]  I think that when you get on a rant, man, I think it's the coolest thing in the world.
[01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:21.461]  You know what?
[01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:27.682]  It's like your older brother sitting there telling you, you know, things that you ought to do and things that you ought not to do.
[01:00:27.822 --> 01:00:29.943]  Your big brother helping you?
[01:00:31.623 --> 01:00:32.303]  That's funny.
[01:00:33.124 --> 01:00:38.565]  Well, you know, it's interesting because I know I'm actually older than you, but I don't know.
[01:00:38.665 --> 01:00:38.885]  Anyway.
[01:00:40.287 --> 01:01:02.201]  One thing I wanted to discuss, I live out here in California in the high desert, in the Mojave Desert, and apparently one of the reporters from the local newspaper was on one of our local talk shows here yesterday talking about how the feds are going to be here for about a week doing terrorist training exercises.
[01:01:03.362 --> 01:01:06.884]  And the funny thing is that nobody knew about it until it happened.
[01:01:07.265 --> 01:01:07.645]  It just
[01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:17.709]  You know, I've heard on your show you've actually warned people and told people that certain terrorist training exercises are going to go on in particular parts of the country.
[01:01:17.989 --> 01:01:22.370]  Yeah, they do drills and drills and drills and drills, and most of the feds aren't, you know, obviously terrorists.
[01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:31.973]  And then when the globals really carry out an attack, it will be a drill, and then they just expect us to ignore the fact that we're running a drill at the exact same time and place where the terror attack took place.
[01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:33.173]  So, see, that's their cover.
[01:01:34.514 --> 01:01:38.438]  But also they do those drills to condition the public for when they really take over.
[01:01:38.479 --> 01:01:39.239]  This is all admitted.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:44.025]  And it creates a subconscious belief that there really are real terror events.
[01:01:44.066 --> 01:01:46.749]  The brain sees this as a real terror attack.
[01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:48.602]  Because there is no terror.
[01:01:48.802 --> 01:01:53.304]  They do these drills all over the country just to, well, they were doing terror drills, terror, terror, terror.
[01:01:53.484 --> 01:02:01.549]  And they'll blow up cars, they'll burn buildings, they'll have helicopters flying around, they'll blow up buses, and then it'll be put on the news.
[01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:04.791]  Look, the general public thinks 24 is real.
[01:02:04.811 --> 01:02:11.454]  That was in the Chicago Tribune, where the government put ads in that about, yeah, reauthorize the Patriot Act, because look what's happening on 24.
[01:02:12.635 --> 01:02:14.717]  I mean, they know it's all blurred, see?
[01:02:14.937 --> 01:02:23.684]  So if the public associates 24 is real, at a subconscious level, and even consciously at certain points, then imagine what they think a terror drill is.
[01:02:24.765 --> 01:02:27.047]  Exactly.
[01:02:27.207 --> 01:02:29.048]  It's called re-education, but go ahead.
[01:02:29.769 --> 01:02:37.115]  Well, no, it's true, because there was a number of callers on this local talk show that mentioned that.
[01:02:37.495 --> 01:02:39.837]  There were some callers that mentioned, look, this is
[01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:46.630]  This is just a conditioning drill to get you people to accept warrantless searches.
[01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:47.671]  I've got a book here.
[01:02:47.691 --> 01:02:49.012]  See, that's the good news.
[01:02:49.052 --> 01:02:49.753]  That's the good news.
[01:02:49.813 --> 01:02:50.874]  People are starting to see through it.
[01:02:50.894 --> 01:02:51.374]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:51.915 --> 01:02:55.678]  Well, I was just going to say, I've got a book here called The Debate on the Constitution.
[01:02:55.718 --> 01:03:05.907]  It's a two-volume set that's got some of the federalist and anti-federalist speeches and articles and letters during the period of ratification.
[01:03:07.586 --> 01:03:09.187]  In this country over the Constitution.
[01:03:09.207 --> 01:03:31.305]  And under warrants and searches, I mean, these people knew way back then that if you gave government carte blanche to take from us, you know, our papers out of secure periods and things like that, we were just going to create a monster.
[01:03:31.385 --> 01:03:32.706]  And that's exactly what we've done.
[01:03:33.971 --> 01:03:37.913]  And the monster has a big fancy PR campaign going, I'm not a monster.
[01:03:37.933 --> 01:03:39.093]  I love you.
[01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:40.114]  I know.
[01:03:40.134 --> 01:03:40.994]  Great points, my friend.
[01:03:41.014 --> 01:03:41.594]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:41.614 --> 01:03:43.295]  And I did hear about that terror drill, by the way.
[01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:44.236]  It is terror.
[01:03:44.256 --> 01:03:45.216]  They were terrorizing you.
[01:03:46.016 --> 01:03:49.218]  James, Rich, Scott, Tony, everybody, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:03:49.238 --> 01:03:49.718]  Stay with us.
[01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:56.446]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.726]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:03:58.966 --> 01:04:06.088]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:17.732]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:04:18.052 --> 01:04:18.873]  We're good to go.
[01:04:18.893 --> 01:04:19.453]  We're good to go.
[01:04:50.154 --> 01:04:55.258]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:04:55.518 --> 01:04:57.100]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.104]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:06.868]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:05:07.308 --> 01:05:11.511]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:05:11.712 --> 01:05:14.554]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:05:14.654 --> 01:05:17.136]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:05:17.336 --> 01:05:23.880]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:31.364]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:05:31.624 --> 01:05:34.046]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:05:34.206 --> 01:05:35.927]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:41.811]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:49.356]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[01:06:04.181 --> 01:06:06.303]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[01:06:06.723 --> 01:06:12.747]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[01:06:13.308 --> 01:06:32.642]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversy surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.
[01:06:33.232 --> 01:06:34.453]  We're good to go.
[01:06:34.473 --> 01:06:34.974]  I think?
[01:06:34.994 --> 01:06:35.574]  We're good to go.
[01:06:35.594 --> 01:06:35.854]  I think?
[01:06:51.013 --> 01:06:58.719]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:06:58.739 --> 01:07:01.961]  All right, callers have been holding for a while.
[01:07:01.981 --> 01:07:04.043]  I think eons is the proper term.
[01:07:05.032 --> 01:07:06.393]  Right now, let's go to who's up next here.
[01:07:32.905 --> 01:07:35.108]  Richard, where are you calling us from today?
[01:07:35.508 --> 01:07:37.110]  Calling in from Central Kentucky.
[01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:37.791]  Welcome!
[01:07:38.151 --> 01:07:45.921]  Yeah, I like the show when I can pick it up, but oftentimes I've got a high-pitched static or something from the Near East music playing.
[01:07:46.101 --> 01:07:47.002]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:47.703]  What's on your mind?
[01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:51.968]  I want you to give me any information on the American Community Survey.
[01:07:53.623 --> 01:07:58.547]  That is the illegal criminal, and federal judge in Houston has said it is criminal.
[01:07:59.487 --> 01:08:01.969]  That is the new bi-yearly census.
[01:08:01.989 --> 01:08:10.875]  It's supposed to be every 10 years, but we, back in 2000, covered the documents on air, where we are going to constantly be in a census.
[01:08:12.067 --> 01:08:12.867]  I think I got the 100 questions.
[01:08:12.947 --> 01:08:15.008]  They want to know when I go to work in the morning.
[01:08:15.068 --> 01:08:16.208]  I believe you got the 49 questions.
[01:08:16.228 --> 01:08:16.889]  49 questions.
[01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:43.395]  Well, I mean, do you have it there in front of you?
[01:08:43.415 --> 01:08:45.257]  Yeah, I got it on the kitchen table.
[01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:47.098]  It's been six years since I looked at it.
[01:08:47.438 --> 01:08:48.679]  Well, how many questions is it?
[01:08:48.719 --> 01:08:49.940]  Read me the top and I can tell you.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.061]  Okay, hang on.
[01:08:51.441 --> 01:08:52.122]  I'll get to it.
[01:08:52.982 --> 01:08:55.284]  While you're getting to it, let me... Oh, do you have it now?
[01:08:55.884 --> 01:08:56.905]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:08:57.326 --> 01:08:58.126]  Okay, read me the top.
[01:08:59.007 --> 01:08:59.507]  Okay.
[01:09:00.388 --> 01:09:03.190]  It's... I got a bunch of other stuff on top of it here.
[01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:05.251]  You ought to get the 100 plus one.
[01:09:05.271 --> 01:09:06.492]  It's like 110 or something.
[01:09:06.532 --> 01:09:08.213]  I forget, but I remember the 49 question one.
[01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:09.674]  I was unlucky enough.
[01:09:09.794 --> 01:09:11.154]  One in six households gets it.
[01:09:11.695 --> 01:09:16.978]  And this punk, literally a zip-faced kid, I pull up one day to my house.
[01:09:18.204 --> 01:09:21.665]  And he parked, and I was living on a major thoroughfare.
[01:09:21.685 --> 01:09:27.087]  Well, not a major thoroughfare, but a busy neighborhood street, one of the biggest in my neighborhood, where cars are going by every 30 seconds.
[01:09:27.447 --> 01:09:29.928]  And this guy's parked two feet off the curb.
[01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:32.889]  I thought it was a cop car or something, but it wasn't a cop car.
[01:09:32.909 --> 01:09:35.470]  It was parked all crooked and hanging out in the street.
[01:09:36.150 --> 01:09:39.291]  And I walk up to the door, and there's this guy berating my wife.
[01:09:40.446 --> 01:09:42.588]  And he's going, listen, I'm a government official.
[01:09:42.688 --> 01:09:47.270]  You've got to answer these questions, because she'd gotten it a few weeks before, and I told her we're not going to answer any of those.
[01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:50.312]  Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, we don't have to do that.
[01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:52.994]  A federal judge has already said in the Houston Chronicle it's illegal.
[01:09:53.274 --> 01:09:54.355]  She's already ruled on it.
[01:09:55.075 --> 01:10:02.960]  All you've got to do is tell them how many people live here, and at that time it was two, my wife and I. And he got in my face, and I said...
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.360]  Hold on one second.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.481]  I went inside, got a camera, came and stuck it in his face.
[01:10:08.182 --> 01:10:09.582]  I never put it on TV for some reason.
[01:10:09.602 --> 01:10:10.042]  I should have.
[01:10:10.302 --> 01:10:16.445]  He started smarting off and I said, you get out of here right now or I'm going to sue you or I'm going to press charges on you for harassment.
[01:10:16.705 --> 01:10:18.285]  And he scurried off and never came back.
[01:10:18.325 --> 01:10:21.026]  Now, it was in the news at the very time.
[01:10:21.066 --> 01:10:22.527]  I did a lot of shows on this for a reason.
[01:10:22.967 --> 01:10:26.008]  Five and a half years later, I still remember all the numbers or most of the numbers.
[01:10:27.687 --> 01:10:30.990]  It happened all over the country where they would bust down doors.
[01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:32.351]  They would assault women.
[01:10:32.872 --> 01:10:33.813]  They would go crazy.
[01:10:33.853 --> 01:10:41.580]  These little people who'd been told they were cops but never had any training, little Nazis, went totally power tripping on people.
[01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:49.614]  All over the nation, dogs were attacking them, all this stuff was happening, and they were threatening people all over the place.
[01:10:49.715 --> 01:11:02.344]  There has been one prosecution in the late 60s, I believe it was 1969 for the 1970 census, of someone who wouldn't fill it out, and they were prosecuted and wrongly convicted.
[01:11:02.364 --> 01:11:03.445]  It was a color of law.
[01:11:03.685 --> 01:11:10.670]  They tried to use that as precedent, but a federal court looked at it in 2000 and ordered them to stop what they were doing in Texas.
[01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:11.231]  But no, sir.
[01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:12.489]  Yeah.
[01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:31.861]  It's in Leviticus, it's in the Mosaic Law, that every ten years there is a numbering of the people, and in the Constitution it is enumerated as a power only for congressional apportionment to decide how many congressmen and women you get via your state's population.
[01:11:31.881 --> 01:11:33.422]  Now that makes sense.
[01:11:33.482 --> 01:11:37.385]  Yeah, and they can only ask how many people live here,
[01:11:38.357 --> 01:11:39.958]  How many people live here?
[01:11:39.998 --> 01:11:40.599]  That's all.
[01:11:40.679 --> 01:11:41.459]  Not your name.
[01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:46.042]  Now, in the questionnaire you've got, it asks what gallon your toilet is.
[01:11:46.062 --> 01:11:48.464]  It asks what time you go to work in the morning.
[01:11:48.524 --> 01:11:49.705]  It asks if you have a renter.
[01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.766]  It asks if your renter pays cash.
[01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:54.628]  In some variant, it asks if you own guns.
[01:11:55.329 --> 01:11:59.131]  It asks what stocks and bonds you have and the total value.
[01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:01.733]  It asks for what banks you use and the name of the banks.
[01:12:02.033 --> 01:12:03.034]  Is that the one you've got?
[01:12:03.054 --> 01:12:04.535]  Mine has 42 questions.
[01:12:06.849 --> 01:12:09.531]  Okay, and then they've gone down from 49 to 42 then?
[01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:10.171]  Mm-hmm.
[01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:13.073]  In that particular, I know of three variant surveys.
[01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:16.675]  Well, just randomly give us a few of the ones you don't like.
[01:12:18.276 --> 01:12:20.457]  How many weeks did you work last year?
[01:12:22.158 --> 01:12:22.458]  You know?
[01:12:23.278 --> 01:12:24.659]  What is your ancestry?
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.061]  Are you a minority?
[01:12:27.501 --> 01:12:30.443]  If you're not a minority, if you're white, what is your ancestry?
[01:12:30.783 --> 01:12:31.023]  You know?
[01:12:32.503 --> 01:12:38.106]  Does it ask you... Well, you said it asks when you go to work, so... I got basically the same survey.
[01:12:38.126 --> 01:12:39.406]  Does it ask about your toilet?
[01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:41.987]  Nothing about a toilet in here, no.
[01:12:42.407 --> 01:12:45.189]  It asks if we have work and plumbing inside the house.
[01:12:47.908 --> 01:12:52.369]  Okay, well then in six years or five and a half years they've changed it or there's different variants out there.
[01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:55.811]  I have three different ones that I've covered and there may be more.
[01:12:56.451 --> 01:13:01.954]  But in the 100 plus survey, it is just unbelievable the questions they ask.
[01:13:02.154 --> 01:13:06.215]  But in the survey I got, it asked what stocks and bonds I have, what value they are.
[01:13:06.255 --> 01:13:14.359]  Now understand, if the police pull you over and you've got three dead bodies in the back seat or let's say a bucket of skulls,
[01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:22.865]  And videotapes of you killing people, they cannot compel you under the Fifth Amendment to incriminate yourself, and you don't have to talk.
[01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:33.236]  Now, how did Ohio a month ago pass a law that a cop doesn't just get to see your ID on the street when you're walking, but you have to quote answer questions or you're arrested and charged with a felony?
[01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:34.257]  How do they do that?
[01:13:34.997 --> 01:13:36.618]  It's a total violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[01:13:36.878 --> 01:13:46.361]  Okay, well how under the census is the federal government claiming that you've got to answer 42 questions or 49 questions or 6 questions or 100 questions?
[01:13:46.601 --> 01:13:47.161]  They can't.
[01:13:47.241 --> 01:13:49.042]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[01:13:49.302 --> 01:13:57.525]  But again, color of law and the federal documents that I've read say that this is going to be basically where we're trained to always answer their questions.
[01:13:58.665 --> 01:14:01.166]  They want to get it down to a monthly basis.
[01:14:03.231 --> 01:14:04.451]  I can believe it.
[01:14:04.532 --> 01:14:14.475]  And in those documents it says that this is a legal document, you better not perjure yourself, or under this code you'll go to jail, and you've got to answer this under this code or you'll go to jail.
[01:14:14.835 --> 01:14:19.977]  All lies, all color of law, illegal, the federal judge, the federal court has already said.
[01:14:20.117 --> 01:14:21.738]  But I don't need the federal court to say that.
[01:14:21.998 --> 01:14:26.380]  Even if the federal court would have said you have to answer it, I don't because the Bill of Rights says I don't.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:26.940]  Yeah.
[01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:29.401]  So...
[01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:33.728]  They can't sign me $5,000 for not sending it in, huh?
[01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:40.341]  There has been one prosecution in 1969, according to my memory, and no, sir.
[01:14:41.906 --> 01:14:42.126]  I think.
[01:15:10.014 --> 01:15:13.318]  Well, we'll just leave it on the kitchen table and see what happens.
[01:15:14.279 --> 01:15:23.729]  Well, what a lot of people did is they just wrote the number of people in the house and said this is all you're authorized to ask, and then you can just give that back to them.
[01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:24.470]  Yeah.
[01:15:25.818 --> 01:15:30.763]  But I wouldn't even do that because, in fact, I've forgotten the particular verbiage.
[01:15:30.843 --> 01:15:33.305]  I mean, I know that they threaten you with jail time and fines.
[01:15:33.606 --> 01:15:38.691]  Can you look at the back and read the particular fake color of law, racketeering clause they put in there?
[01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:40.352]  It says U.S.
[01:15:40.492 --> 01:15:44.816]  Code 13 enhanced to U.S.
[01:15:44.896 --> 01:15:45.817]  Code 18.
[01:15:46.698 --> 01:15:47.599]  It's in the requirement.
[01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:48.740]  Yeah, I remember that.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.261]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:15:50.794 --> 01:15:52.135]  It's total fraud.
[01:15:52.255 --> 01:15:54.817]  It's just more of the government claiming powers it doesn't have.
[01:15:54.837 --> 01:15:55.757]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[01:15:56.198 --> 01:15:57.038]  Good to hear from you, Richard.
[01:15:57.319 --> 01:15:59.220]  Scott and Tejas, you're on the air, Scott.
[01:16:00.361 --> 01:16:00.861]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:16:02.402 --> 01:16:07.145]  I've heard you talk for some time about the possibility of Bush declaring martial law.
[01:16:07.305 --> 01:16:09.427]  Well, he'll call it a civil emergency or freedom.
[01:16:09.787 --> 01:16:13.129]  Just like he calls surveillance terrorist or enemy surveillance.
[01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:15.151]  Yeah, on the...
[01:16:16.184 --> 01:16:28.414]  Local talk shows, even Republican talk shows, but mostly the Democrats, it's becoming a talking point on the local shows.
[01:16:28.514 --> 01:16:28.895]  Oh, I know.
[01:16:28.955 --> 01:16:33.699]  It's gone from only Alex Jones talking about it and even all the so-called patriots criticizing me.
[01:16:33.899 --> 01:16:41.045]  I mean, I've had a lot of these, quote, top patriots have attacked me five, six, seven years ago because I was just reading federal documents
[01:16:41.945 --> 01:16:42.326]  Covering it.
[01:16:42.346 --> 01:16:46.628]  I mean, imagine going to urban warfare drill after urban warfare drill where the U.S.
[01:16:46.688 --> 01:16:50.930]  military with foreign troops admits they're trying to take our guns and put us in camps.
[01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:53.651]  I show video of it, and I'm bad.
[01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:59.274]  And yes, thank God now everybody's talking about it because it's real, and it's probably going to happen.
[01:17:00.273 --> 01:17:03.375]  You think there's a good possibility that Bush would do it?
[01:17:03.556 --> 01:17:09.640]  Yes, there's a very good chance that the Rothschilds will detonate an A-bomb and then just total warfare will ensue.
[01:17:10.201 --> 01:17:13.623]  All we can do is fight back physically if need be or we'll all go to camps.
[01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:18.047]  So Bush, you think he's crazy enough to try it?
[01:17:18.307 --> 01:17:22.130]  Bush is a puppet, but yes, the people controlling him aren't crazy at all.
[01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:28.295]  They're total power freaks and this happens throughout history and they're openly setting it up right now.
[01:17:28.863 --> 01:17:30.584]  Yeah, they're evil demons is what they are.
[01:17:30.644 --> 01:17:32.446]  They are actual evil demons, yes sir.
[01:17:32.966 --> 01:17:36.029]  Again, they openly protect massive child kidnapping rings.
[01:17:36.549 --> 01:17:38.371]  And it's in major newspapers and no one gets in trouble.
[01:17:39.151 --> 01:17:43.995]  I'm going to be, you know, you can't pick up your show on normal stations in Houston.
[01:17:44.015 --> 01:17:52.342]  I just wanted to let you know, I'm going to talk to a couple of investors over the next two or three months about possibly starting a radio station in Houston.
[01:17:52.813 --> 01:17:53.153]  We're good to go.
[01:17:53.173 --> 01:17:53.374]  I think?
[01:18:12.407 --> 01:18:15.108]  They could have always proven it was true by just looking up what I claim.
[01:18:15.529 --> 01:18:18.450]  We post it all on the website every day with the bibliographies.
[01:18:19.411 --> 01:18:22.372]  But, yes, we need to get on in Houston.
[01:18:22.592 --> 01:18:23.713]  It's neocon land.
[01:18:24.273 --> 01:18:33.258]  If Bush declares martial law, then that's a major step towards irreversibility, wouldn't you say?
[01:18:33.378 --> 01:18:35.059]  And the first thing he'll do is open the borders.
[01:18:35.899 --> 01:18:36.279]  Totally.
[01:18:36.659 --> 01:18:38.300]  Before I let you go, I want to let you know...
[01:18:40.869 --> 01:18:43.110]  And look, I'm sorry this is scary and you don't like it.
[01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:43.930]  It's the real world.
[01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:44.930]  I didn't make it this way.
[01:18:45.731 --> 01:18:46.431]  I didn't do this.
[01:18:46.851 --> 01:18:47.892]  So don't blame the messenger.
[01:18:47.972 --> 01:18:49.012]  It's just the real world.
[01:18:53.774 --> 01:18:55.414]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:56.014 --> 01:18:57.755]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:18:58.942 --> 01:19:06.829]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:07.049 --> 01:19:09.671]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[01:19:09.651 --> 01:19:11.072]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:11.232 --> 01:19:18.158]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:18.438 --> 01:19:21.421]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:21.781 --> 01:19:22.281]  We're good to go.
[01:19:22.321 --> 01:19:22.661]  I think?
[01:19:56.892 --> 01:20:00.174]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:00.895 --> 01:20:04.878]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:11.267]  I think.
[01:20:35.037 --> 01:20:35.297]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:20:51.371 --> 01:20:54.253]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:20:54.613 --> 01:20:57.495]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:20:57.715 --> 01:21:03.919]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:21:04.279 --> 01:21:11.604]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:15.867]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:21:45.852 --> 01:21:58.159]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:21:58.299 --> 01:22:11.226]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Stobie, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:22:11.406 --> 01:22:13.187]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:13.948]  We're good to go.
[01:22:32.586 --> 01:22:34.427]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:46.496]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[01:22:46.516 --> 01:22:48.357]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:48.417 --> 01:22:53.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.559 --> 01:23:07.483]  And we should get upset about the fact that the government's openly going.
[01:23:07.563 --> 01:23:12.889]  Well, if there's another big attack, we may have to set aside the Constitution for a military government.
[01:23:13.369 --> 01:23:14.751]  Only that can keep you safe.
[01:23:16.343 --> 01:23:23.310]  Meanwhile, right over the Texas border last night, there was a big bombing and machine gunning of the newspaper.
[01:23:23.690 --> 01:23:27.053]  And the newspaper said, okay, we'll never do another story about drug trafficking.
[01:23:27.394 --> 01:23:28.915]  And that's already happened in Texas.
[01:23:29.556 --> 01:23:33.399]  A lot of towns are afraid now, just like Mexico, we're all a bunch of slaves.
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.342]  People are afraid of Las Zetas and the military.
[01:23:37.123 --> 01:23:41.427]  And our government openly trained them in Fort Benning, Georgia, and is training them in South Texas.
[01:23:42.316 --> 01:23:43.237]  They work for the U.S.
[01:23:43.257 --> 01:23:43.517]  government.
[01:23:43.537 --> 01:23:44.617]  You understand their muscle.
[01:23:44.878 --> 01:23:47.639]  They're going in, killing all the people that don't pay their cut.
[01:23:47.919 --> 01:23:51.641]  This is our government consolidating the drug trade in South Texas.
[01:23:52.502 --> 01:23:54.223]  We've had DEA agents on, you name it.
[01:23:54.603 --> 01:23:58.805]  It's admitted, and it's just right out in the open, real terrorist attacks.
[01:23:59.526 --> 01:24:00.967]  We've had bombings in Dallas.
[01:24:01.487 --> 01:24:05.209]  We've had machine gunnings in San Antonio and surrounding areas.
[01:24:06.090 --> 01:24:06.930]  800 dead last year.
[01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:11.933]  More dangerous than the Gaza Strip State Department emergency department.
[01:24:13.152 --> 01:24:13.733]  We're good to go.
[01:24:42.924 --> 01:24:45.385]  The government creates a crisis, funds a crisis.
[01:24:45.806 --> 01:24:52.469]  They're hit men with plausible deniability, just like our government hires Latin American death squads to kill people in Iraq.
[01:24:52.489 --> 01:24:54.530]  Tens of thousands of them have been hired.
[01:24:54.891 --> 01:24:55.231]  It's over 10,000.
[01:24:55.711 --> 01:24:59.993]  And been brought over to Iraq, led by Negroponte for the first two years.
[01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:02.955]  Now Negroponte's here, setting it up domestically.
[01:25:04.296 --> 01:25:05.777]  See, this isn't a joke.
[01:25:05.877 --> 01:25:07.057]  This isn't a game.
[01:25:07.297 --> 01:25:08.558]  This isn't a drill.
[01:25:08.678 --> 01:25:09.959]  This is real.
[01:25:11.457 --> 01:25:17.300]  And see, now the Mexican mafia, which is really run by our government, can run around enjoying itself, killing whoever they want.
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.021]  The government just goes, aw, too bad.
[01:25:20.401 --> 01:25:29.445]  They're attacking newspapers, and they're shooting members of the press on our side of the border, and they're killing cops, and it's kept real quiet nationally.
[01:25:29.885 --> 01:25:31.606]  Now it's starting to break here in Texas.
[01:25:31.746 --> 01:25:32.546]  Thank God.
[01:25:32.966 --> 01:25:35.267]  Let's go ahead and go back to the caller in Texas.
[01:25:35.907 --> 01:25:36.928]  Scott, finish up your point.
[01:25:39.106 --> 01:25:41.928]  The 2006 midterm elections are coming up.
[01:25:42.868 --> 01:25:46.910]  Do you think there's a chance that the Democrats could take back one of the houses?
[01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:53.393]  And possibly come after Bush for some of his violations?
[01:25:54.934 --> 01:26:00.036]  I've talked to Paul Craig Roberts and others, and many others that have been high-level Republicans in the government.
[01:26:00.909 --> 01:26:03.450]  And that's how the globalists manipulate us.
[01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:07.251]  They will make you think that if the Democrats come in, everything will be okay.
[01:26:07.651 --> 01:26:10.072]  But really, all the Democrats do is add lip service.
[01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:16.234]  All they do is create the illusion that it isn't a unified government against the people when it is.
[01:26:16.274 --> 01:26:17.234]  It's all theater.
[01:26:17.254 --> 01:26:18.735]  Now, there are a few Democrats that are good.
[01:26:18.755 --> 01:26:21.836]  There are a few Republicans that are good that are outspoken.
[01:26:22.156 --> 01:26:25.337]  But the vast majority aren't, and it's nothing but theater.
[01:26:25.417 --> 01:26:28.438]  It is a thespian, theatrical event.
[01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:33.364]  Now, some people say that a separation of powers is good.
[01:26:33.404 --> 01:26:36.066]  The Republicans have the House, the Senate, so they have legislative sewn up.
[01:26:36.386 --> 01:26:37.947]  They have the majority of the state governors.
[01:26:37.967 --> 01:26:40.409]  They have the judiciary.
[01:26:40.489 --> 01:26:41.569]  They have the Supreme Court.
[01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:43.391]  Seven of the nine appointed by them.
[01:26:43.771 --> 01:26:44.972]  But look at all the rulings.
[01:26:45.572 --> 01:26:46.873]  I mean, you could call it communist.
[01:26:47.694 --> 01:26:49.555]  But it just rolls forward.
[01:26:50.155 --> 01:27:05.204]  But I think in the final equation, it would be good to have the Republicans lose control because then it will give some of the minority of the minority group, when they become a majority, maybe a chance to play politics.
[01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:09.747]  That might at least stall some of what's happening with this rolling juggernaut.
[01:27:09.767 --> 01:27:12.969]  You see, the Founding Fathers said gridlock is good.
[01:27:13.369 --> 01:27:15.050]  Separation of powers is good.
[01:27:15.451 --> 01:27:18.993]  So yes, we need to break up the centralization of power.
[01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:24.277]  The problem is, the first thing the Democrats will do is go after our guns and do their normal thing.
[01:27:24.497 --> 01:27:25.477]  But it doesn't really matter.
[01:27:25.597 --> 01:27:27.078]  Bush is doing it covertly.
[01:27:27.359 --> 01:27:32.442]  He's just not passing laws, as Bob Barr, who's on the NRA board, said a month ago here.
[01:27:32.782 --> 01:27:35.184]  He said Bush is worse for the Second Amendment than Clinton.
[01:27:35.704 --> 01:27:36.265]  We're good to go.
[01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.646]  Yeah, people like Limbaugh have the whole country asleep, it seems like.
[01:28:09.507 --> 01:28:12.092]  Yeah, he's a nerve gas, is basically what he is.
[01:28:12.132 --> 01:28:13.414]  He's there to knock everybody out.
[01:28:13.675 --> 01:28:15.699]  And they're flopping around like dying fish, just...
[01:28:16.986 --> 01:28:23.009]  You know, they've got some nerve gases that actually have a hallucinogenic effect that is kind of pleasing as you die.
[01:28:23.069 --> 01:28:25.110]  So they're just smiling, flopping around.
[01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:26.951]  Oh, everything's fine.
[01:28:27.491 --> 01:28:31.994]  Oh, everything would be okay if it wasn't for evil Alex Jones.
[01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:36.596]  People like that are so bad for America.
[01:28:36.896 --> 01:28:38.677]  George Bush is good.
[01:28:38.697 --> 01:28:40.338]  What's wrong with him?
[01:28:41.758 --> 01:28:42.699]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.159 --> 01:28:44.660]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.686 --> 01:28:48.368]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:06.076 --> 01:29:15.987]  is a functional food and it contains no cholesterol, is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein, five natural sterols, and seven of the nine essential amino acids.
[01:29:16.628 --> 01:29:22.894]  The folks at Vitamir have now made maca available in powder form so that you can experience its nutritional benefits.
[01:29:23.555 --> 01:29:24.856]  Call 877-817-9829 to order maca today.
[01:29:28.749 --> 01:29:34.233]  Maca also contains tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and fatty acids not found in other foods.
[01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:37.916]  Try Maca and you'll know the secret of the ancient Incas.
[01:29:38.336 --> 01:29:38.616]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:29:38.656 --> 01:29:40.878]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Maca today.
[01:29:40.898 --> 01:29:41.138]  Maca.
[01:29:41.198 --> 01:29:42.379]  Now you'll know the secret.
[01:29:51.172 --> 01:29:57.394]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:57.534 --> 01:30:03.696]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:03.976 --> 01:30:12.419]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.659 --> 01:30:19.681]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:20.001 --> 01:30:24.804]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:25.024 --> 01:30:30.428]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:30.788 --> 01:30:33.870]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:34.191 --> 01:30:42.156]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.196 --> 01:30:42.776]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:55.083]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:55.303 --> 01:30:58.705]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:30:58.885 --> 01:31:02.326]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:05.861]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:05.881 --> 01:31:11.344]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:31:11.384 --> 01:31:21.008]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:21.128 --> 01:31:22.509]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:31:22.529 --> 01:31:27.931]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:28.431 --> 01:31:32.854]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:32.934 --> 01:31:34.314]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:34.474 --> 01:31:40.418]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll-free number again?
[01:31:40.438 --> 01:31:42.439]  1-877-928-8822 Boy, I am in rant mode today.
[01:31:42.459 --> 01:31:43.419]  I want to
[01:31:58.343 --> 01:32:05.026]  Go through some of the news right now, and then we'll go back to Tony, Jeff, Don, and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:32:05.066 --> 01:32:14.591]  Toll-free number to join us on this live Wednesday edition, the 8th day of February 2006, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:14.711 --> 01:32:22.475]  There are three pages, and by three pages, each special takes up on this printout I have about an inch and a half.
[01:32:22.535 --> 01:32:23.455]  So three pages.
[01:32:23.775 --> 01:32:24.756]  How many specials are there?
[01:32:24.916 --> 01:32:26.677]  One, two, three, four, five, six...
[01:32:29.218 --> 01:32:38.781]  7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 different specials that we're offering on my books and videos and other books and videos that we're now carrying.
[01:32:39.601 --> 01:32:45.743]  We are massively expanding the library of books and videos that we carry, and it's all the best stuff that's out there.
[01:32:46.183 --> 01:32:47.283]  You want to educate yourself.
[01:32:47.303 --> 01:32:50.924]  You want to have tools to wake up your friends and family, your neighbors, people in your community.
[01:32:51.753 --> 01:32:52.314]  We're good to go.
[01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:15.430]  We're good to go.
[01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:15.871]  We're good to go.
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:43.449]  Just burn a DVD, say by martial law, and then every night when you go to bed or when you're sitting there at your desk drinking coffee in the morning, burn a copy.
[01:33:43.469 --> 01:33:44.310]  It takes a few minutes.
[01:33:44.871 --> 01:33:45.632]  Load it on your computer.
[01:33:45.652 --> 01:33:46.593]  That might take 30 minutes.
[01:33:46.934 --> 01:33:49.116]  And once it's burned and loaded, then start burning copies.
[01:33:49.176 --> 01:33:50.158]  Burn a copy every day.
[01:33:51.568 --> 01:34:01.551]  And then take it to work and give it to somebody or give it to a police officer or give it to your pastor or show it at the local library or show it at the VFW Hall.
[01:34:01.731 --> 01:34:02.492]  Get it out.
[01:34:02.612 --> 01:34:04.512]  That's how we have an effect.
[01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:08.213]  And if you have gotten my films and you've watched them, have a party.
[01:34:08.273 --> 01:34:09.234]  Have your friends over.
[01:34:09.574 --> 01:34:14.155]  You know, grill some steaks or chicken or shish kebab, whatever you're into.
[01:34:14.195 --> 01:34:15.076]  If you're a vegetarian.
[01:34:15.096 --> 01:34:16.956]  Now I'm getting into menus.
[01:34:17.176 --> 01:34:19.137]  The point is, have folks over for a party.
[01:34:20.103 --> 01:34:23.167]  Out by the pool or at the local neighborhood park or whatever.
[01:34:24.889 --> 01:34:26.951]  Or have a big screen TV out at the park.
[01:34:26.991 --> 01:34:27.652]  People have done that.
[01:34:27.973 --> 01:34:29.374]  And show them the films.
[01:34:29.474 --> 01:34:31.637]  This is how we engage the New World Order.
[01:34:31.957 --> 01:34:33.980]  This is how we expose the murderers.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.563]  This is how we expose the NWO.
[01:34:37.421 --> 01:34:39.563]  Believe me, they are being damaged right now.
[01:34:39.603 --> 01:34:41.144]  They're losing credibility.
[01:34:41.184 --> 01:34:42.205]  They've moved on us.
[01:34:42.225 --> 01:34:42.825]  They're moving.
[01:34:43.026 --> 01:34:44.207]  They're out in the open now.
[01:34:44.427 --> 01:34:45.568]  They've tipped their hand.
[01:34:45.588 --> 01:34:48.210]  The veil has been drawn to a great extent.
[01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:49.611]  They're still in some shadows.
[01:34:50.091 --> 01:34:53.894]  But more and more, the leering face of the New World Order is coming to the fore.
[01:34:54.375 --> 01:34:58.078]  And now is the time to kick up the row and get the fight going.
[01:34:58.118 --> 01:35:00.059]  So engage in the info war today.
[01:35:00.259 --> 01:35:01.981]  Here are some of the specials I didn't mention earlier.
[01:35:03.342 --> 01:35:05.704]  We have the Protect Your Children book special.
[01:35:06.622 --> 01:35:33.227]  Don't Vaccinate Before You Educate by Dr. Eisenstein, Wild Colts Make the Best Horses by Dr. Breeding, True Nature and Great Misunderstanding by Dr. Breeding, Normally 5685, now 3595, Red, White, and Blue DVD Special, and three 9-11 documentaries, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, 9-1-1, Road to Tyranny, and, of course, Loose Change by Dylan Avery, the new 9-11 film that's excellent.
[01:35:34.789 --> 01:35:46.752]  Also, we have the Reveal the New World Order Plan Special, the Order of Death and Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove DVD combo, two films there, and Dylan Avery's Loose Change for $34.95, usually $45.90.
[01:35:47.092 --> 01:35:54.414]  We have the 9-1-1 Book Special, where you save $12, two great books at a huge discount.
[01:35:54.654 --> 01:35:58.295]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, which is almost out of print, by the way, and I may not reprint it,
[01:35:58.815 --> 01:36:06.098]  And then, of course, Paul Watson's book, Ordered Out of Chaos, about 9-11 and government-sponsored terror.
[01:36:06.118 --> 01:36:07.178]  It covers a bunch of other issues.
[01:36:07.418 --> 01:36:11.620]  And then you get George Humphrey's 9-11, The Great Illusion pamphlet for free.
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:13.960]  Nice little 90-plus page colored booklet.
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:14.481]  Excellent.
[01:36:14.801 --> 01:36:15.881]  For free when you get that.
[01:36:15.901 --> 01:36:16.541]  Normally $31.85, now $19.95.
[01:36:16.581 --> 01:36:17.262]  Amazing t-shirt deals.
[01:36:17.282 --> 01:36:18.042]  Normally $19.95 a piece.
[01:36:18.062 --> 01:36:18.622]  Now as low as $11.95 each.
[01:36:27.708 --> 01:36:32.950]  We make about $4, $5 on that, or even less, because Made in America shirts that are extra large are like $6.50.
[01:36:34.611 --> 01:36:36.872]  Continuing, we get it from Mexico for $2.00.
[01:36:37.132 --> 01:36:38.153]  We don't do that because we're evil.
[01:36:38.593 --> 01:36:45.596]  And then we have the Get Everything Specials, where you save... How much do you save on this one?
[01:36:46.412 --> 01:36:47.653]  It's over $40.
[01:36:47.713 --> 01:36:53.297]  Folks, there's so many specials up on InfoWars.com.
[01:36:53.617 --> 01:36:55.999]  They can answer all your questions when you call.
[01:36:56.299 --> 01:36:58.401]  The toll-free number you can also order there as well.
[01:36:58.421 --> 01:36:59.001]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:59.041 --> 01:36:59.361]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:36:59.521 --> 01:37:01.923]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:15.742]  South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:37:16.982 --> 01:37:27.246]  And from the bottom of my heart, from my family to yours, thank you for all your support, and thank you listeners that have gotten the films and made copies, because it has had a massive effect.
[01:37:27.286 --> 01:37:29.226]  The harvest has been mighty.
[01:37:29.266 --> 01:37:37.129]  Your labors have been wonderful and great, and the harvest has been larger than I ever thought it would be in my focus to tackle the New World Order.
[01:37:37.169 --> 01:37:37.769]  We have just...
[01:37:38.369 --> 01:37:39.090]  Absolutely.
[01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:42.874]  This audience, and you know I don't hype, folks.
[01:37:42.934 --> 01:37:43.534]  It's the truth.
[01:37:43.634 --> 01:37:44.395]  I've never said this.
[01:37:44.875 --> 01:37:49.560]  You have just, we frankly are the tip of the spear.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.201]  And it's daunting.
[01:37:51.382 --> 01:37:55.526]  It's a great responsibility to realize this.
[01:37:55.606 --> 01:37:59.069]  And more and more I'm realizing it from all the data that I see.
[01:37:59.569 --> 01:38:01.471]  You are savaging the enemy.
[01:38:01.691 --> 01:38:02.312]  You are crushing the enemy.
[01:38:02.312 --> 01:38:02.752]  We're good to go.
[01:38:29.961 --> 01:38:31.223]  I want to thank our shortwave affiliates.
[01:38:31.563 --> 01:38:34.367]  I want to thank our satellites, our internet folks, everybody.
[01:38:34.767 --> 01:38:36.790]  You have done a fabulous job.
[01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:46.081]  You should feel really good about the successes we've had just from our firebase, just from our quadrant of the war.
[01:38:46.442 --> 01:38:48.585]  Let me tell you, the news from the front is good.
[01:38:49.125 --> 01:38:56.630]  The enemy forces are massive and arrayed and very sophisticated, but we have smashed many of their capital formations.
[01:38:57.050 --> 01:39:01.252]  We have smashed many of their main operations and lies.
[01:39:01.512 --> 01:39:03.073]  We have flipped paradigms.
[01:39:03.333 --> 01:39:09.597]  We have flipped on the thinking process of tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions worldwide.
[01:39:09.937 --> 01:39:12.219]  You are incinerating the enemy.
[01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:14.260]  Continue attacking them!
[01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:15.301]  Crush them!
[01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:16.222]  They're deadly!
[01:39:16.622 --> 01:39:17.883]  They can still win!
[01:39:17.963 --> 01:39:23.888]  We are in a just absolute tooth and nail fight in the 15th round.
[01:39:23.949 --> 01:39:25.450]  Both sides streaming blood.
[01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:26.571]  Eyes swole shut.
[01:39:26.731 --> 01:39:27.972]  Gut up for your families.
[01:39:28.252 --> 01:39:29.594]  Intensify the fight.
[01:39:29.854 --> 01:39:35.919]  If you haven't gotten in the fight, it's all like we're part of this larger community that wants freedom and liberty and decency and loves God.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.662]  And all of you as cells have to fire.
[01:39:38.982 --> 01:39:40.583]  You have to engage in the battle.
[01:39:40.623 --> 01:39:43.163]  You have to strain yourselves in the battle.
[01:39:43.383 --> 01:39:46.244]  You have to shoot your mouth off in the grocery store line.
[01:39:46.524 --> 01:39:49.025]  You've got to stand up in church and rebuke the preacher.
[01:39:49.305 --> 01:39:55.867]  You've got to stand up with your liberal tea-drinking circle who's talking about how the Democrats will save us and expose them.
[01:39:56.127 --> 01:40:00.729]  You've got to stand up at your NRA meeting locally and talk about how the NRA is selling out gun owners.
[01:40:00.989 --> 01:40:03.770]  You've got to stand up and flip the paradigms and be bold.
[01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:05.550]  Let me tell you something.
[01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:07.811]  Take the toll roads in Texas.
[01:40:09.125 --> 01:40:10.626]  They are under massive attack.
[01:40:10.646 --> 01:40:11.387]  They're being sued.
[01:40:11.407 --> 01:40:12.587]  They're being exposed.
[01:40:12.767 --> 01:40:20.973]  And thousands of people last night showed up out in Buda where they're trying to turn the major highway into a toll road to pay money to go home.
[01:40:21.373 --> 01:40:26.757]  And they put John Hurt, the TxDOT spokesman, up to go, We're just trying to improve the roads.
[01:40:26.777 --> 01:40:27.937]  The improvement will be good.
[01:40:27.998 --> 01:40:28.758]  Everyone likes it.
[01:40:29.018 --> 01:40:30.159]  I heard him on radio saying this.
[01:40:30.659 --> 01:40:31.460]  And I saw him on TV.
[01:40:32.678 --> 01:40:36.301]  But then you cut to another newscast and it shows thousands of people.
[01:40:36.321 --> 01:40:37.141]  It's what it looked like to me.
[01:40:37.161 --> 01:40:40.704]  A huge, giant auditorium full of people screaming at them.
[01:40:41.124 --> 01:40:42.004]  Everyone against it.
[01:40:42.024 --> 01:40:44.586]  You might have one or two bureaucrats there with signs for it.
[01:40:45.046 --> 01:40:47.048]  I mean, it's just the people are on fire!
[01:40:47.368 --> 01:40:48.969]  And it's going to spread criminals.
[01:40:49.169 --> 01:40:51.731]  You're going to be brought to justice, you arrogant scum.
[01:40:52.091 --> 01:40:54.553]  You think up in your ivory towers you're safe.
[01:40:54.593 --> 01:40:56.054]  You think you're not going to be exposed.
[01:40:56.554 --> 01:41:01.780]  We're going to use due process on you, and one day, you better know, you're going to face a jury.
[01:41:02.121 --> 01:41:03.482]  And then you're going to pay.
[01:41:03.502 --> 01:41:06.205]  And it's all going to be done according to the Constitution.
[01:41:06.445 --> 01:41:07.587]  And you're going to pay.
[01:41:08.147 --> 01:41:09.889]  Believe me, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:41:09.929 --> 01:41:11.191]  It's far away, folks.
[01:41:11.551 --> 01:41:14.133]  It's over the Misty Mountains, but I can tell you, I can see it.
[01:41:14.433 --> 01:41:16.054]  And let me tell you, we have a real chance.
[01:41:16.114 --> 01:41:18.536]  Wouldn't you love to arrest these people?
[01:41:18.776 --> 01:41:20.597]  Wouldn't you love to put them in prison?
[01:41:20.877 --> 01:41:23.639]  Wouldn't you love to see justice brought on them?
[01:41:23.899 --> 01:41:32.465]  Wouldn't you love to see these arrogant pieces of trash shaking and crying like those Nazi generals at the Nuremberg trials, literally wetting themselves?
[01:41:32.685 --> 01:41:35.747]  Because let me tell you something, they're a bunch of cowards deep down!
[01:41:36.087 --> 01:41:37.127]  They think they're tough.
[01:41:37.347 --> 01:41:38.748]  They think they can dominate us.
[01:41:38.928 --> 01:41:40.188]  They think we're their slaves.
[01:41:40.328 --> 01:41:41.768]  Well, we're not your slaves.
[01:41:42.528 --> 01:41:43.609]  And you're going to lose.
[01:41:43.649 --> 01:41:44.709]  We've got the initiative.
[01:41:44.929 --> 01:41:46.289]  We've got the moral authority.
[01:41:46.509 --> 01:41:47.809]  You will lose.
[01:41:48.089 --> 01:41:49.490]  Right when you think you've beat us.
[01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:51.570]  Right when you think your empire's built.
[01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:53.291]  That's when you always implode.
[01:41:53.471 --> 01:41:55.031]  You are destined to implode.
[01:41:55.191 --> 01:41:56.691]  You are destined to fail.
[01:41:56.811 --> 01:41:58.712]  It is your destiny.
[01:41:58.972 --> 01:42:00.432]  You are losers.
[01:42:00.712 --> 01:42:01.934]  You are failures.
[01:42:02.274 --> 01:42:03.356]  Life hates you.
[01:42:03.756 --> 01:42:05.158]  God hates you.
[01:42:05.438 --> 01:42:06.920]  You are failures.
[01:42:07.241 --> 01:42:09.003]  The human spirit hates you.
[01:42:09.243 --> 01:42:11.667]  Creativity is disgusted by you.
[01:42:11.927 --> 01:42:13.970]  Beauty is repulsed by you.
[01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:15.111]  You are weak.
[01:42:15.352 --> 01:42:16.413]  You are failures.
[01:42:16.613 --> 01:42:17.835]  You are losers.
[01:42:18.315 --> 01:42:18.756]  We're good to go.
[01:42:46.343 --> 01:42:50.967]  You know, the big problem is I'm working out a lot more than I used to, and I'm sure my testosterone level has also increased.
[01:42:50.987 --> 01:43:04.697]  I start bike riding a couple hours a day and lifting weights again, and I... My dad was over at the house eating Saturday, and he said, Alex, you've got that old gleam in your eye again.
[01:43:04.717 --> 01:43:05.958]  This is how I was in the past.
[01:43:06.696 --> 01:43:10.277]  And I just for years quit working out and just kind of working all the time.
[01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:18.501]  I guess it was kind of a way to self-reverse Medicaid, where if I didn't work out, I was just more relaxed and like a jellyfish.
[01:43:19.421 --> 01:43:26.544]  And now, folks, I just see the threat, and I'm all fired up, and I just want to wage war on the New World Order and the info battle.
[01:43:28.124 --> 01:43:28.664]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:43:30.225 --> 01:43:35.127]  Okay, let's cover news, and then I'll stop being the preacher, and I'll go to your calls.
[01:43:36.861 --> 01:43:40.582]  Let's go ahead and get into this little tidbit.
[01:43:40.602 --> 01:43:43.343]  Paul Watson sent another great article on this.
[01:43:45.644 --> 01:43:49.425]  New evidence suggests Muslim riots are staged SIA.
[01:43:50.425 --> 01:44:01.809]  PaulJosephWatsonPrisonPlanet.com As news breaks of four more demonstrators being shot dead in Kabul, fresh evidence has surfaced that
[01:44:02.521 --> 01:44:11.366]  Lending credibility to the assertion that the Muslim riots are a staged psyop, or at the very least, based on false pretenses.
[01:44:11.466 --> 01:44:12.166]  That's guaranteed.
[01:44:12.726 --> 01:44:21.871]  Yesterday's leading Russian member of parliament, Vladimir Zarovsky, said the riots were a manufactured psychological operation on the part of the U.S.
[01:44:21.911 --> 01:44:26.213]  in an attempt to enlist hardened EU support for a military strike against Iran.
[01:44:26.253 --> 01:44:28.854]  And we know they stirred up the riots in France to begin with.
[01:44:29.074 --> 01:44:31.876]  That made Sharad going from being against the war to wanting to nuke Iran.
[01:44:34.077 --> 01:44:46.566]  As first highlighted by this website and others, more evidence has come to light that confirms fake and misleading caricatures were bundled in with the more tame cartoons that were printed in Danish newspapers.
[01:44:46.967 --> 01:44:52.371]  Muslims were misled into believing that all the images were printed in newspapers when they were not.
[01:44:52.891 --> 01:45:11.194]  World Net Daily reports one of the three especially inflammatory but undocumented Mohammed images distributed by the Danish Imam as an example of anti-Muslim environment in the European country turns out to be a poorly reproduced copy of an Associated Press photo taken of a French pig squealing contest.
[01:45:12.114 --> 01:45:28.944]  The weblog, Netherland News, pointed out that the image used by Imam Ahmad Abu Laban was a faxed copy of AP's August 15th photo of Jacques Barrett competing in the annual French Pig Squealing Championships in Tres-sur-Bas.
[01:45:29.665 --> 01:45:30.605]  Can't pronounce that.
[01:45:30.665 --> 01:45:31.706]  People in France are laughing.
[01:45:32.364 --> 01:45:33.125]  And it goes on.
[01:45:33.225 --> 01:45:44.812]  Another two images were erroneously added to the caricatures that were actually carried by newspapers depicting Muhammad as a pedophile demon and a dog raping a praying Muslim.
[01:45:45.893 --> 01:45:48.235]  Can you imagine if a newspaper showed Jesus doing that?
[01:45:48.675 --> 01:45:49.736]  But that isn't what really happened.
[01:45:50.196 --> 01:45:51.777]  This is incredible.
[01:45:52.856 --> 01:45:55.779]  Were the misleading images intended to add fuel to the fire?
[01:45:56.179 --> 01:46:01.904]  Many have pointed out the depictions of Muhammad appear universally throughout the world.
[01:46:01.984 --> 01:46:03.505]  A stone sculpture in the U.S.
[01:46:03.546 --> 01:46:06.228]  depicting Muhammad has been in place since the 1930s.
[01:46:06.568 --> 01:46:13.975]  An Australian newspaper piece lists depictions of Muhammad, both flattering and insulting, that appear regularly in the West and beyond.
[01:46:14.495 --> 01:46:17.779]  But again, neocon publications kept running it, made a big deal out of it.
[01:46:18.180 --> 01:46:20.543]  Then they stirred up some of their neocon imams.
[01:46:20.903 --> 01:46:22.245]  They got a lot of them on the payroll.
[01:46:22.265 --> 01:46:23.046]  Go release this.
[01:46:23.186 --> 01:46:26.169]  Then somebody serves out new Danish flags to be burned.
[01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:27.651]  It goes on and on.
[01:46:29.073 --> 01:46:30.555]  And it just continues.
[01:46:32.558 --> 01:46:39.442]  A CNN International news anchor reported that the United Nations had foreknowledge that protests in Beirut were going to erupt on Sunday.
[01:46:40.002 --> 01:46:52.489]  Anthony Mills, CNN International, quote, My understanding is as well that UN sources were reporting this morning that there was going to be a chaotic day, if you will, or certainly they were reporting that they were suggesting that workers shouldn't go to work that day.
[01:46:52.529 --> 01:46:53.369]  They knew in advance.
[01:46:53.429 --> 01:46:56.371]  And it just goes on and on with the new evidence.
[01:46:56.711 --> 01:47:00.753]  And so that's just one article out of the stack of about 30 articles here that I'm looking at.
[01:47:02.247 --> 01:47:06.349]  The Republican who oversees NSA calls for wiretap inquiry.
[01:47:07.289 --> 01:47:08.069]  New York Times.
[01:47:08.529 --> 01:47:19.773]  A House Republican whose subcommittee oversees the National Security Agency broke ranks with the White House on Tuesday and called for a full congressional inquiry into the Bush administration's domestic eavesdropping program.
[01:47:20.173 --> 01:47:30.997]  The lawmaker, Representative Heather A. Wilson of New Mexico, chairwoman of the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence, said in an interview that she had serious concerns about the surveillance program
[01:47:31.417 --> 01:47:39.279]  By withholding information about its operations from the lawmakers, she said, the administration has deepened her apprehension about whom the agency is monitoring and why.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:56.505]  Number one, folks, if Al-Qaeda even existed outside of Western intelligence agencies' conjuring rooms, if it existed outside of their fabrication centers, they all know, everyone knows who's got a brain, that everything's monitored by keyword software.
[01:47:56.965 --> 01:47:59.786]  They just want to announce this to the world now to create a chilling effect.
[01:47:59.826 --> 01:48:00.426]  That's number one.
[01:48:01.207 --> 01:48:17.814]  Number two, all of these intelligence committee members know, and anybody who reads a lot of newspapers knows, that there are articles every day about the Army spying on groups that get together and bake cookies or groups that get together and make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for Halliburton employees in Houston and tell them that they're being scammed.
[01:48:18.335 --> 01:48:20.215]  Bike riding groups that aren't even political.
[01:48:20.576 --> 01:48:21.356]  Hundreds of groups.
[01:48:21.876 --> 01:48:24.018]  Hundreds and hundreds of groups being spied on by the Pentagon.
[01:48:24.038 --> 01:48:32.707]  I mean, we've got video and photos of events we're at years ago, before 9-11, with the Army walking around with video cameras videotaping us 50 miles from a military base.
[01:48:33.028 --> 01:48:34.209]  Nothing to do with the military.
[01:48:35.071 --> 01:48:38.694]  The military is just here to assist local law enforcement.
[01:48:38.714 --> 01:48:41.576]  Of course, it's a total violation of Posse Comitatus, the 1878 law.
[01:48:41.756 --> 01:48:48.460]  And we've seen Ridge and now Chertoff and all these people on TV saying we need to, quote, get rid of Posse Comitatus.
[01:48:48.781 --> 01:48:54.365]  But if Bush has all this super executive power to be a dictator, why do you need to repeal something if you are the law?
[01:48:54.605 --> 01:48:56.006]  See, they've given up on all that.
[01:48:56.306 --> 01:48:57.727]  Now they're just saying they're above it.
[01:48:59.207 --> 01:49:12.837]  And again, back in 1988, we've confirmed this, and we have the interviews and the documents, there were Marines in Norfolk, Virginia, in a secret pilot program, dressing up in police jackets, aiding the police, quote, in raiding gun dealers.
[01:49:13.487 --> 01:49:14.648]  That's in my film, Road to Journey.
[01:49:15.188 --> 01:49:34.939]  So this has been going on for a long time, very quietly, creating the teams, the cadres, to go train larger groups, creeping, building their secret armies, building them up, getting them larger and larger, taking the 24% of the troops that say they'll fire on Americans, promoting them, then sheep-dipping them, then putting them into secret intelligence agencies.
[01:49:35.139 --> 01:49:36.440]  They're all over the place.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.500]  It's all admitted.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.021]  It's all totally criminal.
[01:49:39.241 --> 01:49:40.102]  It's all against U.S.
[01:49:40.142 --> 01:49:40.582]  citizens.
[01:49:40.622 --> 01:49:42.023]  No phone calls to Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:42.623 --> 01:49:44.805]  What they have is debating phone calls from Al Qaeda, see?
[01:49:45.326 --> 01:49:47.949]  To just legitimize the entire process.
[01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:49.810]  Being bathed in the evil.
[01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:51.492]  More news, your call's coming up.
[01:49:51.512 --> 01:49:58.279]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:49:58.599 --> 01:49:59.960]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:00.181 --> 01:50:01.382]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:02.523 --> 01:50:04.584]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:04.884 --> 01:50:09.826]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:10.147 --> 01:50:14.188]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:14.449 --> 01:50:16.209]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:16.289 --> 01:50:21.852]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control program,
[01:50:22.012 --> 01:50:26.936]  The cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.076 --> 01:50:28.978]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:29.178 --> 01:50:33.041]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the Infowars.
[01:50:33.141 --> 01:50:34.703]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:50:50.788 --> 01:50:58.310]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:50:58.590 --> 01:51:09.493]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:09.633 --> 01:51:10.033]  We're good to go.
[01:51:26.249 --> 01:51:26.749]  That's right.
[01:51:26.929 --> 01:51:34.031]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:43.072]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.092 --> 01:51:43.573]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:52.679 --> 01:51:58.621]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.

[01:52:07.984 --> 01:52:08.644]  We're good to go.
[01:52:37.515 --> 01:52:40.596]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:40.756 --> 01:52:46.697]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:56.839 --> 01:52:57.999]  I've got to talk about this.
[01:52:58.099 --> 01:53:00.360]  I've got to talk about it.
[01:53:01.181 --> 01:53:04.083]  I've done it so much, but I haven't really detailed it for years.
[01:53:04.163 --> 01:53:09.966]  I should go print all the articles that I personally have written and Ed Holman wrote years ago, where we have the documents.
[01:53:10.066 --> 01:53:11.766]  I mean, we've been at checkpoints.
[01:53:11.927 --> 01:53:13.968]  We've videotaped it, where the Army's out.
[01:53:14.408 --> 01:53:16.589]  They pull over a Greyhound bus in collusion with Greyhound.
[01:53:16.609 --> 01:53:18.010]  They tell the people it's real.
[01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:19.370]  Later they admit it's a drill.
[01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:21.291]  Imagine being part of a drill you weren't told was a drill.
[01:53:21.772 --> 01:53:26.174]  They run a couple different Army teams, regular Army, with special forces patches, by the way.
[01:53:26.877 --> 01:53:28.478]  And then they told us, oh, we're not really special forces.
[01:53:28.498 --> 01:53:29.938]  We just wear these uniforms.
[01:53:29.958 --> 01:53:30.999]  That's all on tape.
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:40.803]  We have, who was it, Captain Smart in Temple runs over and tries to tell us to turn our cameras off and not to videotape the trips because it was all illegal.
[01:53:41.564 --> 01:53:47.827]  And the fool hands us, well, actually an FBI agent pulls up after two hours was there on the scene.
[01:53:47.847 --> 01:53:49.848]  It was actually Mike Hanson was there, but he got it on video.
[01:53:50.208 --> 01:53:52.809]  This is back on the day before Thanksgiving in 1998.
[01:53:55.996 --> 01:53:59.438]  And there's army all over the place running around, and they're getting really mad.
[01:53:59.458 --> 01:54:00.679]  They're covering their faces up.
[01:54:01.519 --> 01:54:03.580]  And the idiot FBI agent gave us a document.
[01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:04.661]  He wasn't supposed to.
[01:54:04.681 --> 01:54:07.122]  It wasn't classified, though, but it was restricted.
[01:54:08.063 --> 01:54:09.263]  It's on the website right now.
[01:54:09.283 --> 01:54:10.584]  We need to post that on the main page.
[01:54:10.804 --> 01:54:11.324]  From 1998.
[01:54:12.145 --> 01:54:14.786]  And it says, we're here to serve warrants on people's homes.
[01:54:15.146 --> 01:54:17.007]  We're here for fugitive apprehension.
[01:54:17.167 --> 01:54:17.648]  The U.S.
[01:54:17.808 --> 01:54:19.589]  Army aids the local police.
[01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:21.950]  And it says, we have agreements with 77 counties.
[01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.410]  Go read it.
[01:54:24.663 --> 01:54:25.384]  All criminal.
[01:54:25.564 --> 01:54:27.245]  All totally illegal.
[01:54:28.686 --> 01:54:31.248]  Well, our policy says Fort Hood can do this.
[01:54:31.268 --> 01:54:35.450]  And then when the public asks, they go, oh, we just aid in bomb disposal.
[01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:37.271]  Is that one of their spokesmen on?
[01:54:37.472 --> 01:54:38.252]  We just aid.
[01:54:38.572 --> 01:54:39.293]  Oh, really?
[01:54:39.353 --> 01:54:40.213]  In warrant service?
[01:54:40.293 --> 01:54:42.175]  Well, I really can't talk about that.
[01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:45.457]  And they're in police uniforms all over the place.
[01:54:46.505 --> 01:54:47.045]  Felonies.
[01:54:47.486 --> 01:54:49.227]  Every time they're doing it.
[01:54:49.767 --> 01:54:54.850]  And George Bush says it's just calls from Bin Laden when he calls America.
[01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:57.792]  Isn't it okay for me to do that without warrants?
[01:54:59.052 --> 01:55:04.456]  And they have national polls and 52% say, I guess it's okay if you're only spying on terrorists.
[01:55:06.337 --> 01:55:07.978]  And that's just one case.
[01:55:08.638 --> 01:55:09.899]  One case of it.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:15.082]  We've got to write an updated article about that and it ought to be the headline...
[01:55:16.753 --> 01:55:20.337]  NSA spying probe distraction from military takeover.
[01:55:20.557 --> 01:55:21.479]  That should be the headline.
[01:55:21.519 --> 01:55:23.601]  And then just documents and hyperlinks.
[01:55:23.641 --> 01:55:24.722]  And it's got phone numbers.
[01:55:24.743 --> 01:55:25.884]  You can call the numbers still.
[01:55:25.944 --> 01:55:27.566]  Same offices in Fort Hood answer.
[01:55:27.586 --> 01:55:31.811]  You can go to the website and call the phone numbers and say, I'm a local police department.
[01:55:32.192 --> 01:55:33.753]  Tell you what, police chiefs are listening right now.
[01:55:33.773 --> 01:55:35.556]  A lot of them are fans of the show, Smaller Towns.
[01:55:36.216 --> 01:55:38.199]  Just go get the document off my website.
[01:55:38.319 --> 01:55:39.601]  You've probably already heard from them anyways.
[01:55:39.882 --> 01:55:42.485]  And just call them and say, hey, will you help me go serve some warrants?
[01:55:42.866 --> 01:55:48.614]  And they'll come land helicopters, special forces will pile off with your SWAT team, and they'll go raid some farmer.
[01:55:49.608 --> 01:55:53.991]  Oh, yeah, all out there by Llano, that town north of it.
[01:55:54.011 --> 01:55:54.551]  I forget the name.
[01:55:54.571 --> 01:55:57.193]  We did a documentary just for TV about it.
[01:55:57.213 --> 01:55:58.574]  I'll have to find that and put it on the website.
[01:55:58.854 --> 01:56:07.919]  It's all these little families living in 150-year-old German houses with three-foot-thick walls, and you can remember the little Germans with their goat farms out there, and they still have German accents.
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:11.121]  The troops come, and they kick down the door with police.
[01:56:11.442 --> 01:56:12.782]  Point the machine gun at me.
[01:56:13.023 --> 01:56:14.563]  And there's checks out there we've interviewed.
[01:56:14.584 --> 01:56:15.204]  It's happening, too.
[01:56:15.484 --> 01:56:18.286]  Just these little people that haven't even ever seen marijuana.
[01:56:18.926 --> 01:56:19.526]  And the U.S.
[01:56:19.607 --> 01:56:20.387]  Army's, yeah!
[01:56:20.667 --> 01:56:21.508]  Troops, move forward!
[01:56:21.548 --> 01:56:22.448]  Road meter, go forward!
[01:56:22.648 --> 01:56:23.368]  Get down on the floor!
[01:56:23.388 --> 01:56:24.089]  Get down on the floor!
[01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.729]  Get down on the floor!
[01:56:25.029 --> 01:56:26.390]  Oh, there's no troops.
[01:56:26.770 --> 01:56:28.451]  No, they're not spying on us.
[01:56:28.751 --> 01:56:29.932]  Everything's fine.
[01:56:30.092 --> 01:56:34.214]  I've just watched them setting up the martial law, building the camps, getting ready for it.
[01:56:34.234 --> 01:56:35.855]  And then it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:56:36.255 --> 01:56:39.457]  Oh, Halliburton's going to run emergency camps for your safety.
[01:56:39.977 --> 01:56:42.699]  And they run the camps over in the Middle East.
[01:56:42.719 --> 01:56:44.860]  They run them in Central Europe, Eastern Europe.
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:46.961]  They're the ones involved in all of this.
[01:56:47.879 --> 01:56:50.621]  And if that ain't something to yell and scream about, I don't know what is.
[01:56:50.721 --> 01:56:53.443]  If that isn't something to get upset about, I don't know what is.
[01:56:54.604 --> 01:56:56.425]  Let it come home to you, folks.
[01:56:56.745 --> 01:57:02.769]  It's a hundred times, a hundred times worse what you see on the nightly news.
[01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.710]  It's everywhere.
[01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:04.831]  They're ready to go.
[01:57:04.971 --> 01:57:06.632]  It has nothing to do with terrorists.
[01:57:06.892 --> 01:57:09.214]  It has to do with total tyranny.
[01:57:10.006 --> 01:57:12.748]  They want total tyrannies because this country's bankrupt.
[01:57:12.768 --> 01:57:15.690]  They're going to take your pension funds and everything you've got.
[01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:22.114]  And a lot of people, when they get scared in this system, will decide to serve it just that much harder, trying to hold on to what you've got.
[01:57:22.314 --> 01:57:26.977]  You're not going to hold on to what you've got unless you stop letting these people buffalo us.
[01:57:27.277 --> 01:57:28.678]  Now get in there and fight them!
[01:57:28.758 --> 01:57:29.418]  Expose them!
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:35.962]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:47.508 --> 01:57:48.148]  Big Brother.
[01:57:48.808 --> 01:57:49.848]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:51.689]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.329 --> 01:57:53.150]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:55.831]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.851 --> 01:57:59.172]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.652 --> 01:58:03.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.056 --> 01:58:10.496]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:10.536 --> 01:58:11.577]  Now into the third hour.
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:19.423]  I was trying to chronicle some of the admitted criminal actions of special military teams gearing up for martial law in the last two decades.
[01:58:21.284 --> 01:58:24.826]  And how this is all a bit red herring talking about NSA spying.
[01:58:24.846 --> 01:58:26.606]  That's just to introduce you to your shackles.
[01:58:27.887 --> 01:58:30.968]  You know, first you just show the horse the bridle before you try to break them.
[01:58:30.988 --> 01:58:32.209]  You just get them used to seeing it.
[01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:34.870]  They're just, look at the bridle, lookie.
[01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:37.991]  And then they show you the bridle, then you bring the horse the feedback.
[01:58:38.272 --> 01:58:39.092]  You bring them the grain.
[01:58:39.972 --> 01:58:42.433]  You get them used to seeing the bridle and associating it with the grain.
[01:58:42.993 --> 01:58:43.873]  Look, here's the bridle.
[01:58:43.953 --> 01:58:44.593]  Keeps you safe.
[01:58:44.633 --> 01:58:45.214]  That's the grain.
[01:58:45.454 --> 01:58:45.834]  Bridle.
[01:58:45.914 --> 01:58:46.534]  Keeps you safe.
[01:58:46.774 --> 01:58:47.354]  Martial law.
[01:58:47.374 --> 01:58:48.014]  Keeps you safe.
[01:58:48.374 --> 01:58:50.095]  Martial law's coming for your own good.
[01:58:50.155 --> 01:58:50.795]  For your own good.
[01:58:51.015 --> 01:58:52.436]  Here's the... Let me put this on you.
[01:58:52.676 --> 01:58:53.136]  There.
[01:58:53.416 --> 01:58:55.396]  Let me... Oh, now you're much better.
[01:58:55.696 --> 01:58:58.297]  Now we can put you on the trailer and ship you to the glue factory.
[01:58:59.678 --> 01:59:02.618]  Or ship you over to France to be cut up into horse steaks.
[01:59:03.639 --> 01:59:04.739]  There's my analogy for you.
[01:59:04.759 --> 01:59:07.060]  Let's go to your calls and I'll get into the whole Iran situation.
[01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:08.000]  Big new developments there.
[01:59:08.953 --> 01:59:12.200]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Arkansas.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.022]  Welcome, Tony.
[01:59:13.563 --> 01:59:14.264]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:14.485 --> 01:59:15.587]  God bless you for what you do.
[01:59:16.357 --> 01:59:16.877]  God bless you.
[01:59:16.917 --> 01:59:17.418]  What's on your mind?
[01:59:17.438 --> 01:59:17.718]  Thank you.
[01:59:18.178 --> 01:59:25.663]  I had a quick comment on the American Census, and if I could, just a quick quote also from George Washington that is so poignant for today, what we're facing.
[01:59:26.583 --> 01:59:31.006]  We had received one of those census fill-out forms, and I refused to do it.
[01:59:31.066 --> 01:59:32.167]  Total violation of the amendment.
[01:59:32.187 --> 01:59:32.347]  Sorry.
[01:59:32.367 --> 01:59:32.887]  Go ahead.
[01:59:32.907 --> 01:59:33.428]  That's fine.
[01:59:33.488 --> 01:59:33.908]  Thank you.
[01:59:34.768 --> 01:59:36.349]  We got a call then.
[01:59:36.389 --> 01:59:38.811]  They follow it up with a call, and I explained to the lady...
[01:59:39.965 --> 01:59:43.348]  That I had sent it on to my state representative.
[01:59:43.368 --> 01:59:44.389]  We know a state representative.
[01:59:44.409 --> 01:59:46.230]  Since when do you get a census every year?
[01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.751]  Go ahead.
[01:59:46.971 --> 01:59:47.311]  Amen.
[01:59:47.471 --> 01:59:49.773]  So I told them, I said, constitutionally, you guys can't do this.
[01:59:49.873 --> 01:59:51.334]  I said, we've contacted, which I did.
[01:59:51.354 --> 01:59:53.276]  I contacted ASU and Little Rock, and they...
[01:59:53.723 --> 02:00:00.686]  had told us that they actually have a couple of cases where they're suing them because constitutionally they can only do this once every decade.
[02:00:00.746 --> 02:00:03.527]  A federal court said in 2000 in Houston they can't do it.
[02:00:03.827 --> 02:00:05.067]  Okay.
[02:00:05.147 --> 02:00:07.128]  I did not know that, but we refused to.
[02:00:07.168 --> 02:00:07.908]  We sent it on to our state.
[02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:13.351]  And the woman on the phone said, she said, and this is what she told me, she said, it is voluntary.
[02:00:13.391 --> 02:00:14.411]  You don't have to fill it out.
[02:00:14.451 --> 02:00:15.271]  Now, that amazed me.
[02:00:15.571 --> 02:00:19.673]  This is how much they buffalo us and people tend to back down and just go, oh, I better fill it out.
[02:00:20.017 --> 02:00:24.742]  And then I explained to her my reasons, and what was funny is at the end of the phone call... She agreed with you?
[02:00:24.762 --> 02:00:26.323]  She agreed, yeah.
[02:00:26.363 --> 02:00:30.247]  She said, you know, 99% of what you just said I agree with, but I have to forward this on.
[02:00:30.307 --> 02:00:31.108]  I said, go ahead.
[02:00:31.548 --> 02:00:32.189]  Forward away.
[02:00:32.469 --> 02:00:44.101]  And if we will all stand up... So you got her to admit it's voluntary, but when some cretin, a lot of serious criminal records, shows up at your house, especially if you're not there, are you married?
[02:00:44.913 --> 02:00:45.314]  No, I'm not.
[02:00:45.354 --> 02:00:47.936]  Well, they love putting screws to women, really intimidating them.
[02:00:48.397 --> 02:00:50.719]  Did you hear the stories about them busting into houses and stuff?
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:51.500]  No, I did not.
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.002]  Yeah, they go totally nuts.
[02:00:53.743 --> 02:00:59.749]  But we just must not in any way cow to that fear-mongering that they want to do, because as soon as they do, we've lost.
[02:01:00.262 --> 02:01:02.683]  And if I could, this is from America's God and Country.
[02:01:02.703 --> 02:01:03.464]  It's a terrific book.
[02:01:03.484 --> 02:01:04.805]  You can find it in most Christian bookstores.
[02:01:05.125 --> 02:01:07.426]  It's got quotes of the founding fathers and many people.
[02:01:07.786 --> 02:01:09.327]  Anyway, this is so apropos.
[02:01:09.347 --> 02:01:15.330]  From General Washington at the time, it was when the American forces were getting ready to engage King George, the British.
[02:01:16.151 --> 02:01:18.092]  But this is a great quote, and I thank you.
[02:01:18.132 --> 02:01:18.852]  Here it is, Alex.
[02:01:19.152 --> 02:01:27.277]  The time is now near at hand which must probably determine whether Americans are to be free men or slaves, whether they are to have any property they can call their own,
[02:01:27.697 --> 02:01:31.198]  And I believe he goes on to say he puts it in the hands of God and asks for divine providence.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:56.601]  It's just awesome.
[02:01:56.781 --> 02:02:00.506]  And by the way, some of those first battles, it would be 6,000 against 40,000.
[02:02:01.186 --> 02:02:02.888]  And amen, Alex.
[02:02:02.968 --> 02:02:03.589]  And thank you.
[02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:05.892]  Because with God, the truth is on our side.
[02:02:05.972 --> 02:02:07.453]  We've just got to stand up to these.
[02:02:07.473 --> 02:02:09.676]  And if we do it now, it'll be harder.
[02:02:10.697 --> 02:02:21.902]  When you throw in with righteousness, when you throw in on the right side, when you throw in, what God really likes to see is His first waves of His people get crushed and destroyed, and then God always comes in after that point.
[02:02:21.942 --> 02:02:23.663]  A lot of us are going to have to die doing this.
[02:02:23.923 --> 02:02:30.346]  It's going to happen, but that is a good price to pay to defeat this enemy, because more of us will die if we serve them.
[02:02:31.144 --> 02:02:31.664]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:32.124 --> 02:02:32.484]  You bet.
[02:02:32.524 --> 02:02:34.245]  I mean, that's why you've got to commit, folks.
[02:02:34.265 --> 02:02:40.727]  You've got to commit like George Washington did when he was facing down 40,000 of King George's battle-hardened troops.
[02:02:43.488 --> 02:02:44.108]  Hello, folks.
[02:02:44.208 --> 02:02:45.128]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:45.248 --> 02:02:49.369]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:02:49.489 --> 02:02:52.370]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:02:52.450 --> 02:02:59.132]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:02:59.332 --> 02:03:02.336]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:03:02.556 --> 02:03:04.918]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:03:05.079 --> 02:03:15.230]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:17.892]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:03:44.173 --> 02:03:47.014]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:03:47.275 --> 02:03:48.855]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:49.195 --> 02:03:53.858]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:03:54.218 --> 02:04:00.941]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:01.961]  We're good to go.
[02:04:19.446 --> 02:04:23.128]  And uncover the power man cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:04:23.368 --> 02:04:25.789]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:04:44.531 --> 02:04:50.154]  ...to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[02:04:50.374 --> 02:04:55.376]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:55.717 --> 02:05:03.600]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:03.760 --> 02:05:10.804]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:11.024 --> 02:05:12.245]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:12.385 --> 02:05:15.786]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:15.846 --> 02:05:16.946]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:17.247 --> 02:05:18.527]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:18.727 --> 02:05:25.550]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:25.670 --> 02:05:28.131]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:05:31.314 --> 02:05:32.275]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:43.912 --> 02:05:46.094]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:46.675 --> 02:05:49.557]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.045 --> 02:05:58.306]  It's the real world!
[02:05:59.133 --> 02:05:59.613]  Face it.
[02:05:59.794 --> 02:06:04.997]  It's always better to face the truth, not to deny it, not to rationalize, not to make excuses.
[02:06:05.017 --> 02:06:06.539]  I want to get into Iran here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:06.819 --> 02:06:09.741]  Let's get to some more of these calls first, moving quickly, hopefully.
[02:06:09.761 --> 02:06:13.504]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Colorado.
[02:06:13.524 --> 02:06:14.144]  Jeff, go ahead.
[02:06:14.524 --> 02:06:17.146]  Yeah, Alex, hey, I just wanted to make a couple of points.
[02:06:17.447 --> 02:06:24.752]  First of all, this is a message to the cowardly Congress, cowardly and corrupt Congress, and the puppet that's in the White House.
[02:06:25.290 --> 02:06:31.432]  And, of course, members of Congress are criminally covering up for the criminal activities of the Bush administration.
[02:06:31.492 --> 02:06:33.933]  They know all about the troops and the secret environment.
[02:06:34.073 --> 02:06:37.033]  Major national interest and national security.
[02:06:37.394 --> 02:06:46.436]  And, Alex, I wanted to say that, you know, first of all, CIA Porter Gauss was the worst appointment ever in CIA history as far as being a CIA director.
[02:06:46.456 --> 02:06:48.317]  And several analysts have said that.
[02:06:48.717 --> 02:06:49.117]  And, of course,
[02:06:49.662 --> 02:06:55.947]  What they don't want to admit, their CIA operatives and CIA agents, the CIA don't care about those guys.
[02:06:55.987 --> 02:06:57.508]  They will hang them out to dry.
[02:06:57.708 --> 02:07:12.360]  But my point is this, and this is, again, to the Congress and to the puppet that's up in the White House, there are people within their own government, people that are working with them and for them, that are not liking what's going on.
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:16.823]  There's people, there's former government agents, there's current government agents,
[02:07:17.253 --> 02:07:19.614]  That want to restore constitutional order.
[02:07:19.975 --> 02:07:21.516]  And this is my prediction, Alex.
[02:07:21.936 --> 02:07:31.882]  If President Bush, this puppet, and his cowardly corrupt Congress tries to institute martial law, and if they try any of their dirty little tricks, this is my prediction.
[02:07:32.358 --> 02:07:39.161]  These former government agents and these agents who want to restore constitutional order, we're not the ones they're going to have to worry about.
[02:07:39.441 --> 02:07:48.805]  They're going to have to worry about these former government agents and these current government agents that are going around... Well, how many of them have we had on this broadcast, former and current?
[02:07:48.925 --> 02:07:49.505]  Exactly.
[02:07:49.545 --> 02:07:52.146]  Pop conservatives saying we're going into martial law.
[02:07:52.206 --> 02:07:53.227]  Ron Paul said...
[02:07:53.894 --> 02:08:02.937]  The last time he was on, about a month and a half ago, that the government is preparing to go into martial law and to start arresting people and to actually set up a Nazi Germany type system.
[02:08:02.977 --> 02:08:08.039]  He said it, without me even prompting him, he said we're in danger of a total takeover.
[02:08:08.119 --> 02:08:09.439]  Well, my prediction is this.
[02:08:09.579 --> 02:08:11.760]  If they try to pull any of those dirty tricks...
[02:08:12.392 --> 02:08:32.839]  These former government agents and these agents that want to restore constitutional order, these former government agents and agents are going to go around the country, they're going to be targeting these officials, they're going to be targeting government buildings, just like they did in the Oklahoma City bombing, where they went in with brass angle irons and C4 explosives and blew up the building.
[02:08:34.419 --> 02:08:36.140]  These government officials and these government...
[02:08:37.421 --> 02:08:38.081]  Okay.
[02:08:38.881 --> 02:08:39.902]  They're going to have to be warned.
[02:08:39.922 --> 02:08:42.764]  They're going to have to be... What's going to happen if we go to work?
[02:08:42.944 --> 02:08:49.467]  Because these former government agents and these agents are not going to... They're not going to allow this to happen, what they're trying to do.
[02:08:49.547 --> 02:08:50.828]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:08:51.388 --> 02:08:53.550]  I don't really get the last point you're making.
[02:08:54.090 --> 02:09:00.553]  We know Oklahoma City was a government op, and I know you obviously know that because you talked about how there were plastic explosives on the pillars, and that's admitted.
[02:09:01.414 --> 02:09:04.476]  Yes, that's publicly available if you want to go research it.
[02:09:04.556 --> 02:09:04.916]  It's like a...
[02:09:05.658 --> 02:09:07.240]  Public secret, is what I like to call it.
[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:08.120]  Most people know it.
[02:09:08.981 --> 02:09:15.607]  Even FBI agents have gone public about it, but still some people don't know about it, and the government itself keeps denying it.
[02:09:15.707 --> 02:09:22.754]  But I don't want to count on foggy, mysterious people in the government that are going to save us at the last minute.
[02:09:23.995 --> 02:09:29.720]  Now, how many former Special Forces commanders have gone public and said they'll fight against this tyranny?
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:30.420]  Many of them.
[02:09:30.441 --> 02:09:30.761]  We've had...
[02:09:31.514 --> 02:09:33.374]  I don't know, probably ten of them on in the last few years.
[02:09:33.874 --> 02:09:38.215]  How many people in the military have emailed me, written me, called the show, and said they're aware of it?
[02:09:38.235 --> 02:09:45.197]  I mean, we've had former Delta Force commanders call in who ran very famous operations.
[02:09:45.257 --> 02:09:48.497]  I don't have time to get off all into it, saying that they're not going to go along with it.
[02:09:48.557 --> 02:09:56.379]  We've had so many people who aren't idiots, who do know, who have been on the inside, that do have the big picture, who will not go along with it.
[02:09:57.099 --> 02:09:58.699]  What do you think all these leaks are?
[02:09:59.298 --> 02:09:59.679]  We're good to go.
[02:10:09.898 --> 02:10:26.847]  Sometimes when a really damaging leak comes out, say that the Pentagon's spying on all these domestic groups and it's admitted, suddenly then they'll all focus on NSA looking at foreign phone calls to the U.S., you know, the most minimalistic problem or one of the smallest things that's going on that they can somewhat defend.
[02:10:26.887 --> 02:10:31.250]  Again, it's a straw man that they build up and they put out there to then have a debate about that.
[02:10:32.230 --> 02:10:39.374]  To then divert us off of just the cornucopia of other examples that are patently criminal that cannot be defended.
[02:10:40.749 --> 02:10:42.513]  So it's a game of brinksmanship.
[02:10:42.693 --> 02:10:45.177]  And yes, the good news is the people are responding.
[02:10:45.558 --> 02:10:48.744]  Government, non-government, private sector, it doesn't matter.
[02:10:48.944 --> 02:10:51.569]  All over the place, people are getting it.
[02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.611]  I mean, think about it.
[02:10:53.433 --> 02:10:53.853]  Think about it.
[02:10:53.894 --> 02:11:06.086]  I mean, there have been a lot of bold and brave radio stations like WBCR in Tennessee and K6L in Kansas City and the Sunshine Network in upstate New York and WVTJ in Pensacola, Florida and KJFK in Austin.
[02:11:06.626 --> 02:11:08.588]  All of these stations at 1260 a.m.
[02:11:08.628 --> 02:11:09.169]  I could go on.
[02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:14.354]  There's dozens and dozens of them that have had us on for six, seven, eight years.
[02:11:14.394 --> 02:11:15.255]  I guess longer than that.
[02:11:15.295 --> 02:11:17.177]  Time is just flying past us.
[02:11:18.743 --> 02:11:21.524]  But now there are stations every week turning us on.
[02:11:21.544 --> 02:11:24.785]  It isn't a station every few weeks or a station every month.
[02:11:24.825 --> 02:11:26.986]  It's stations every week.
[02:11:27.046 --> 02:11:30.707]  And used to we'd have new stations turn us on and a station turn us off.
[02:11:30.747 --> 02:11:33.948]  We seemed to kind of hover around between 50 and 80 affiliates.
[02:11:34.448 --> 02:11:38.030]  Now it's gone way past that and we're getting new affiliates all the time.
[02:11:38.070 --> 02:11:39.530]  And they're conservative stations.
[02:11:39.570 --> 02:11:45.232]  They're Air America stations where it's a private owner who starts figuring out that Air America isn't going far enough.
[02:11:45.992 --> 02:11:46.213]  So...
[02:12:14.958 --> 02:12:17.039]  Right there is a really good indicator.
[02:12:18.199 --> 02:12:27.142]  Now, the globalists can carry out a terror attack tomorrow or next week or next year, and they'll get the momentum back on their side for a while, but now they lose that momentum quicker and quicker.
[02:12:28.122 --> 02:12:32.804]  For the first week after the London bombing, I said, looks like a government op, but we can't prove that.
[02:12:32.884 --> 02:12:35.045]  Let's see if it's provocateur or if it's real.
[02:12:35.105 --> 02:12:39.006]  It could be real, but even if it's real, we shouldn't give up all of our freedoms because of this.
[02:12:39.947 --> 02:12:52.914]  And then major publications were already saying it could be the government before I was even ready to give it our certification, for what that's worth, that clearly it's a government op.
[02:12:53.434 --> 02:13:01.439]  And then we can have somebody like John Loftus, head of counterterrorism in the Clinton administration for the FBI.
[02:13:02.683 --> 02:13:12.547]  With a national show on ABC Radio, and he goes on Fox News and goes, a SWAT, clearly he's MI6, and looks like the British government, at least provocateur this attack and let it happen, may be involved.
[02:13:13.228 --> 02:13:15.389]  I mean, he never talked to Alex Jones to go say that.
[02:13:15.409 --> 02:13:16.449]  He didn't get that from me.
[02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:18.490]  The guy lives in New York City.
[02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:20.511]  He's a senior retired FBI agent.
[02:13:20.731 --> 02:13:21.491]  Very respected.
[02:13:21.531 --> 02:13:22.852]  He came out and said what I was saying.
[02:13:22.972 --> 02:13:25.533]  Because, I mean, if it's the truth, folks, it's the truth.
[02:13:26.714 --> 02:13:28.995]  Veritas stands on its own.
[02:13:29.055 --> 02:13:30.875]  The truth stands on its own.
[02:13:31.656 --> 02:13:31.796]  And...
[02:13:32.771 --> 02:13:35.574]  To go through the London bombing evidence, again, it's an orgy of evidence.
[02:13:35.614 --> 02:13:41.499]  You start clicking off and ticking off the reasons, it just... There's hundreds of red flags.
[02:13:41.939 --> 02:13:42.900]  Same with 9-11.
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:44.781]  It's purely an inside job.
[02:13:45.162 --> 02:13:49.205]  And now, the globalists carry out attacks, people immediately go, hey, wait a minute.
[02:13:49.846 --> 02:13:50.626]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:13:52.108 --> 02:13:53.969]  So that's really, really exciting.
[02:13:53.989 --> 02:13:55.751]  I want to get into Iran, but let's keep going to calls.
[02:13:55.791 --> 02:13:59.734]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Missouri.
[02:13:59.774 --> 02:14:00.395]  Don, go ahead.
[02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:03.286]  Hey Alex, keep up that exercise routine.
[02:14:03.326 --> 02:14:04.147]  I love your passion.
[02:14:05.487 --> 02:14:08.627]  Hey listen, I called a couple days ago about a question.
[02:14:08.667 --> 02:14:10.848]  I'm afraid I didn't develop it adequately enough.
[02:14:11.608 --> 02:14:12.928]  And I think it's an important question.
[02:14:12.948 --> 02:14:15.109]  I'd love to get your response to it.
[02:14:15.229 --> 02:14:16.329]  Okay.
[02:14:16.849 --> 02:14:26.291]  It has to do with the place of the United States and the pecking order of the New World Order and the rivalry or whatever between the Euro and the dollar and why it is that the U.S.
[02:14:26.351 --> 02:14:26.851]  is always the
[02:14:27.389 --> 02:14:32.874]  ...government that's involved with the worst dirty tricks on the planet, just like Paul Watson wrote about recently.
[02:14:33.834 --> 02:14:40.960]  And it goes back to World War II, when Churchill was wanting reassurances from FDR that after the war, the U.S.
[02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:46.185]  would help England's empire from unraveling, and Roosevelt wouldn't do it.
[02:14:46.565 --> 02:14:50.428]  And it seems that after he died and the war was over, that the U.S.
[02:14:50.528 --> 02:14:56.333]  elite decided to go ahead and let the British Empire die and replace it with an American empire...
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:00.981]  But it would be a different one instead of having Viceroy... Well, I would say it this way.
[02:15:01.681 --> 02:15:13.604]  It's like Microsoft hypothetically merging, if the trust busters allowed it, let's say merging with Apple.
[02:15:14.144 --> 02:15:17.725]  So it wouldn't be that Apple disappeared or went away.
[02:15:17.765 --> 02:15:24.026]  It would just kind of merge or become an amalgam, amalgamate into one.
[02:15:25.227 --> 02:15:25.827]  But no.
[02:15:26.887 --> 02:15:30.810]  Listen, it's just like a lot of big car dealership chains are owned by the same owners.
[02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:31.511]  There's a big chain.
[02:15:31.531 --> 02:15:33.813]  There's two chains in Texas, really owned by one guy.
[02:15:33.833 --> 02:15:36.635]  But they like to create the illusion of two different brands.
[02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:42.419]  And the two major companies will actually compete against each other.
[02:15:44.060 --> 02:15:49.644]  They are free market to the extent of that they do have managers competing with each other.
[02:15:49.664 --> 02:15:54.747]  I mean, even in one company, you'll have real competition within that company.
[02:15:54.767 --> 02:16:00.831]  So the New World Order is competing with itself at certain levels, but at the top it is centralized.
[02:16:00.871 --> 02:16:04.713]  I mean, this has even been in Forbes magazine several times.
[02:16:05.314 --> 02:16:07.415]  They have a list of who owns most of America.
[02:16:07.755 --> 02:16:10.657]  And first it's British families, next it's Dutch families,
[02:16:11.595 --> 02:16:20.819]  Then it is Americans, then it's Germans, and then after that it goes down the line with the French, and then the Saudi Arabians, and then the Japanese.
[02:16:21.779 --> 02:16:24.220]  So, take the Carlyle Group.
[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:27.882]  Queen of England's the majority owner, and then she owns large portions of Lockheed.
[02:16:27.922 --> 02:16:30.223]  She owns large portions of fast food chains.
[02:16:30.563 --> 02:16:36.125]  She owns... I mean, they literally own large sections of major oil companies, the controlling stock.
[02:16:36.425 --> 02:16:40.107]  Large portions in portfolios, in media, and in newspapers.
[02:16:40.667 --> 02:16:59.141]  So, no, really, sir, it really is the Rothschilds and the Saxe-Coburg-Gophers, the German royal family that runs the Dutch and the British, from all of my research and the real scholarly reports and their own documents, they own like half the world's wealth conservatively.
[02:16:59.161 --> 02:17:08.988]  Well, I don't disagree with that at all in terms of the financial factors and the occultic bloodlines and all that stuff, but the United States has built up this powerful military, and you know that...
[02:17:10.576 --> 02:17:14.360]  Within any conspiracy or alliance of nations, there's always rivalry.
[02:17:14.701 --> 02:17:19.126]  I can't imagine why the American elites would want to just give up their military and their control over the world.
[02:17:19.726 --> 02:17:21.548]  Black combining forces.
[02:17:22.529 --> 02:17:22.870]  Stay there.
[02:17:22.890 --> 02:17:23.491]  We'll talk about it more.
[02:17:23.511 --> 02:17:24.432]  It's a very important question.
[02:17:24.672 --> 02:17:31.700]  Listen, the major universities in America in the last 150 years openly were bought off by British money.
[02:17:33.051 --> 02:17:36.593]  They paid for the scholarships of most of the congressmen.
[02:17:36.813 --> 02:17:37.553]  They own them.
[02:17:37.953 --> 02:17:39.273]  They go to British schools.
[02:17:40.554 --> 02:17:41.594]  They're not giving up power.
[02:17:41.614 --> 02:17:42.195]  They have power.
[02:17:43.595 --> 02:17:54.319]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:17:54.499 --> 02:18:02.082]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:02.302 --> 02:18:11.513]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels, and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:18:11.773 --> 02:18:17.920]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:22.161]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:18:22.221 --> 02:18:24.122]  The water level is always visible.
[02:18:24.302 --> 02:18:30.244]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:18:30.484 --> 02:18:34.425]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.445 --> 02:18:35.005]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:49.161 --> 02:18:52.424]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:18:53.165 --> 02:18:57.129]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:03.416 --> 02:19:06.538]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:06.798 --> 02:19:08.619]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:08.679 --> 02:19:11.720]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:12.401 --> 02:19:14.482]  Here is reality.
[02:19:14.842 --> 02:19:18.424]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:18.904 --> 02:19:22.586]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:23.146 --> 02:19:25.707]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:27.307 --> 02:19:27.867]  We're good to go.
[02:19:43.945 --> 02:19:46.287]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[02:20:43.476 --> 02:20:50.560]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[02:20:51.220 --> 02:20:52.001]  I'm Tex Mars.
[02:20:52.421 --> 02:20:56.603]  My newest book, Codex Magica, is a real eye-opener.
[02:20:56.623 --> 02:21:00.185]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[02:21:00.746 --> 02:21:09.571]  Codex Magica shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.

[02:21:14.074 --> 02:21:15.495]  Their mysterious symbols.
[02:21:15.835 --> 02:21:17.376]  Their hidden language.
[02:21:17.996 --> 02:21:18.877]  Encyclopedic.
[02:21:19.457 --> 02:21:20.078]  Documented.
[02:21:20.338 --> 02:21:24.441]  Codex Magica unmasked a conspiracy of immense evil.

[02:21:49.787 --> 02:21:52.087]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:54.411]  It works like this.
[02:21:54.471 --> 02:22:04.080]  The British Empire was already the most powerful empire in the world in the 1780s, 1790s, 1800s, especially after they defeated Napoleon.
[02:22:06.383 --> 02:22:11.808]  And there was a divorce between the colonies and the British, but...
[02:22:13.210 --> 02:22:24.858]  By the 1880s, 1890s, they had already started buying off most of the newspapers and most of the banks, and they got their banking system in and then fully got it in in 1913.
[02:22:25.659 --> 02:22:30.842]  And so it's just like if you get a divorce from your wife and then a year later, hey, baby, let's get back together.
[02:22:31.362 --> 02:22:40.729]  So I think that confusing the two, America is the big engine, the pudding pie that has been funding and feeding this whole thing
[02:22:41.697 --> 02:22:44.618]  And again, a lot of Americans know we're an empire now.
[02:22:44.658 --> 02:22:47.019]  I've seen news articles where they go, yeah, we're an empire, so what?
[02:22:47.059 --> 02:22:47.819]  It's our job.
[02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:49.740]  But it's not an empire of good.
[02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:51.641]  It's an empire of control and domination.
[02:22:52.501 --> 02:23:00.624]  And so they just go out and fund and create enemies or carry out terror attacks against their populations to mobilize us, to stir us up, to go after their enemies.
[02:23:01.318 --> 02:23:03.999]  So I hope that makes sense to you, Don.
[02:23:04.379 --> 02:23:05.619]  I don't really understand your question.
[02:23:05.639 --> 02:23:08.499]  Are you saying you don't understand why this elite would give up their power?
[02:23:08.699 --> 02:23:09.820]  They're not giving up their power.
[02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:14.140]  It's like cousins teaming up together to run a business together.
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.741]  They get more power inside this system.
[02:23:17.421 --> 02:23:18.661]  It's just like a university.
[02:23:19.621 --> 02:23:21.062]  The power gets passed down.
[02:23:21.082 --> 02:23:22.362]  Oh, I agree.
[02:23:22.422 --> 02:23:25.102]  And they certainly aren't going to lose in this whole thing.
[02:23:25.142 --> 02:23:28.043]  But the point is, you know, the human pride and rivalry and all that stuff,
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:36.025]  Like the old saying goes, he who has the gold can make the rules, but he who has the guns can take the gold, you know?
[02:23:36.686 --> 02:23:45.692]  And I'm wondering if this Bush administration, and he really does seem to be hated by the Europeans, and one of the reasons we invaded Iraq... Well, that's the European population, sir.
[02:23:46.613 --> 02:23:52.016]  Look at Jacques Chirac saying he'll nuke Iran right now, and Europe's solidly on board to go into Iran.
[02:23:52.036 --> 02:23:55.659]  Well, what if we're trying to manipulate Europe to get behind...
[02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:58.241]  That's their population.
[02:23:58.641 --> 02:23:59.382]  Their population?
[02:23:59.402 --> 02:24:02.564]  Yeah, they're getting them on board like 9-11 got us on board for Iraq.
[02:24:04.265 --> 02:24:05.505]  It's an encouragement.
[02:24:06.026 --> 02:24:08.827]  This neocon administration, it seems different.
[02:24:08.867 --> 02:24:14.971]  All the other White Houses since World War II seem to have been overtly supportive of the EU and the UN and all that.
[02:24:15.543 --> 02:24:17.563]  But this one, Steve, I wonder if they're making a bid.
[02:24:17.663 --> 02:24:28.526]  There were policy reports a decade ago saying people are getting wise to the left-right paradigm, so they have to then take it to a global level.
[02:24:28.926 --> 02:24:30.886]  It's a false bipolar diversion.
[02:24:30.906 --> 02:24:34.147]  Well, there's no doubt that Bush is the perfect Trojan horse.
[02:24:34.367 --> 02:24:37.768]  Well, it's just like the... Look, look, thanks for the call.
[02:24:38.728 --> 02:24:39.868]  It's just like Bush will...
[02:24:40.976 --> 02:24:45.098]  Say he's against the UN and they're bad, and then he'll double their funding.
[02:24:45.158 --> 02:24:45.618]  Literally.
[02:24:46.939 --> 02:24:47.639]  It's theater, sir.
[02:24:47.679 --> 02:24:50.961]  It's like the Democrats and Republicans having these staged fights.
[02:24:51.841 --> 02:24:52.821]  It's staged, sir.
[02:24:53.602 --> 02:25:00.645]  I mean, carnies at a carnival will stage a scam to separate you from your money.
[02:25:00.685 --> 02:25:01.585]  Good cop, bad cop.
[02:25:01.605 --> 02:25:05.267]  Two cops will stage an argument where one plays good, one plays bad.
[02:25:05.987 --> 02:25:07.368]  Don't you know the elite does that?
[02:25:08.283 --> 02:25:09.024]  I know you know that.
[02:25:09.264 --> 02:25:12.386]  Let's go to Don in New York.
[02:25:12.426 --> 02:25:12.987]  Go ahead, Don.
[02:25:13.007 --> 02:25:14.248]  Hello?
[02:25:14.508 --> 02:25:14.808]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:15.669 --> 02:25:16.009]  Hi.
[02:25:16.109 --> 02:25:23.335]  I was bringing up something that I needed to get some information from you that I've been having a hard time doing, but I need to do this.
[02:25:24.275 --> 02:25:34.243]  And that is, part of it is give me liberty or give me death, and I must do this because God demands us, all of us, to stand up as citizens of the United States of America.
[02:25:34.971 --> 02:25:37.692]  If you must do it, tell us what you must do.
[02:25:37.832 --> 02:25:51.676]  To get a copy of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, because I honestly, myself, don't remember everything that's in it, and I need to get copies of it so that they're complete, because I've got books with it in it, but it's too many pages of mixed garbage.
[02:25:51.896 --> 02:25:53.316]  Well, sir, do you have a computer?
[02:25:54.617 --> 02:25:55.657]  No, my daughter does.
[02:25:55.837 --> 02:25:56.817]  Okay, well, just do this.
[02:25:58.118 --> 02:26:02.479]  Go to your daughter and say, Hon, will you type Bill of Rights in to Google?
[02:26:03.368 --> 02:26:05.150]  Well, you type Declaration of Independence.
[02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:06.411]  Well, you type Constitution.
[02:26:06.431 --> 02:26:10.434]  And they're all not that long, probably 20, 30 sheets of paper, depending on type size.
[02:26:10.815 --> 02:26:13.016]  And you just click on it, and you hit the Print button.
[02:26:13.477 --> 02:26:15.078]  It'll come out of the printer, and then you'll have it.
[02:26:15.599 --> 02:26:21.884]  Or you can go to any large bookstore, and they do normally have little booklets that have it in it.
[02:26:23.946 --> 02:26:25.988]  Also, you can call the network right now.
[02:26:26.889 --> 02:26:27.769]  Which I never promote.
[02:26:27.809 --> 02:26:28.430]  I should do this.
[02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:33.992]  They have a deal where they will sell you citizen rule books, I think for like $2 a piece or something.
[02:26:34.433 --> 02:26:39.915]  Or they have a deal where you get a silver dollar and then along with two citizen rule books for, I think, $24.95.
[02:26:40.615 --> 02:26:42.456]  And you can call this number, 800-686-2237.
[02:26:42.476 --> 02:26:42.516]  800-686-2237.
[02:26:51.147 --> 02:26:53.211]  And they will sell you a citizen rule book.
[02:26:53.472 --> 02:26:54.674]  Can you say that a little slower?
[02:26:54.714 --> 02:26:55.155]  Sure.
[02:26:55.175 --> 02:26:55.235]  1-800-686-2237
[02:27:03.993 --> 02:27:04.193]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:27:04.213 --> 02:27:04.594]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:27:05.254 --> 02:27:13.436]  All right, thank you.
[02:27:14.956 --> 02:27:17.117]  Thank you, sir, and I'm glad that you want to do that.
[02:27:17.157 --> 02:27:17.777]  I commend you.
[02:27:17.817 --> 02:27:21.478]  Most Americans have never looked at it, and God bless you for calling.
[02:27:21.518 --> 02:27:22.599]  A very important question.
[02:27:22.779 --> 02:27:26.680]  That number for those that missed it, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:29.180]  I know I talk fast, so let me say that again.
[02:27:29.421 --> 02:27:30.381]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:30.421 --> 02:27:30.801]  Stay with us.
[02:27:33.692 --> 02:27:34.593]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.094 --> 02:27:36.696]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.637 --> 02:27:40.300]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.283 --> 02:27:49.030]  Discover a natural way to experience healthier, cleaner indoor air without expensive filters and high-maintenance machines.
[02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:51.753]  Discover what natural health professionals have known for decades.
[02:27:51.913 --> 02:27:54.556]  Natural salt lamps ionize and purify indoor air.
[02:27:54.716 --> 02:27:58.400]  Natural salt lamps come handcrafted from salt crystals that are millions of years old.
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:03.606]  These lamps create healthy ions that eliminate odor, reduce bacteria, and can help allergy and asthma sufferers.
[02:28:03.806 --> 02:28:04.247]  We're good to go.
[02:28:26.527 --> 02:28:26.747]  That's 312-224-2710.
[02:28:43.186 --> 02:28:45.127]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:28:45.227 --> 02:28:55.932]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:56.312 --> 02:29:00.834]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:00.914 --> 02:29:12.240]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:13.561]  We're good to go.
[02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:45.042]  We're good to go.
[02:30:00.715 --> 02:30:06.498]  Stem Enhance's natural ingredients help to support the release of stem cells from your bone marrow into your bloodstream.
[02:30:06.698 --> 02:30:18.144]  Through a natural process, those stem cells have the amazing ability to transform into any type of cell in the body, like heart cells, brain cells, liver cells, can all be generated from this powerful building block.
[02:30:18.424 --> 02:30:27.909]  Thousands of people who use Stem Enhance have reported spectacular results, experiencing everything from an increase in energy in just a few days to an improvement in overall health.
[02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:33.372]  Not available in stores, Stem Enhance is available by contacting Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[02:30:33.392 --> 02:30:33.632]  That's 860-567-7744.
[02:30:33.652 --> 02:30:35.893]  All right, I'll continue taking calls at 800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:30:35.913 --> 02:30:39.555]  Someday, I ought to just read the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[02:30:59.082 --> 02:30:59.422]  On air.
[02:30:59.442 --> 02:31:03.025]  In fact, maybe I should just do that right now.
[02:31:03.045 --> 02:31:07.089]  I've got several pocket constitutions here.
[02:31:09.731 --> 02:31:10.651]  It is important to do.
[02:31:10.671 --> 02:31:19.899]  Let me just read a little bit of the Declaration of Independence, then I'm going to get into the Iran situation, and then we'll take a few final calls here for those that have been holding patiently.
[02:31:21.713 --> 02:31:26.316]  This is the Declaration of Independence, Action of Second Continental Congress, July 4th, 1776.
[02:31:26.356 --> 02:31:33.741]  Yes, it's more than just about fireworks and hot dogs and T-bones and Budweiser, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:34.201 --> 02:31:37.903]  The unanimous declaration of the 13 United States of America.
[02:31:38.543 --> 02:31:47.209]  When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which has connected them with another...
[02:31:48.114 --> 02:31:49.894]  Kind of like a local carpetbagger here in town.
[02:31:49.914 --> 02:31:50.915]  I don't want anything to do with them.
[02:31:50.955 --> 02:31:52.415]  See, I'm in the same boat here.
[02:31:53.135 --> 02:32:18.080]  When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which has connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth a separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind require that they should declare the cause which impel them to separate
[02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:24.202]  And that's what we do here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 and of course back from 9 to midnight.
[02:32:25.362 --> 02:32:26.702]  With a rebroadcast from 1 a.m.
[02:32:26.802 --> 02:32:27.262]  to 4 a.m.
[02:32:27.302 --> 02:32:28.063]  all time central.
[02:32:28.583 --> 02:32:32.424]  We are the discussions.
[02:32:33.124 --> 02:32:40.446]  We are here putting forward the proofs of the criminality and the evil that we live under.
[02:32:40.606 --> 02:32:41.726]  And I'm having one of those moments.
[02:32:41.806 --> 02:32:44.407]  What was that called for the 10 years before the Revolutionary War?
[02:32:45.194 --> 02:32:46.575]  Committees of correspondence.
[02:32:46.615 --> 02:32:49.797]  Yes, little private newsletters discussing what was really going on.
[02:32:50.097 --> 02:32:51.318]  The printing press.
[02:32:53.539 --> 02:32:55.761]  Listing the crimes of the corrupt government.
[02:32:56.781 --> 02:33:00.904]  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.
[02:33:01.707 --> 02:33:19.799]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, originally property, that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, not by a president saying he's got unlimited power.
[02:33:20.279 --> 02:33:28.745]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government.
[02:33:29.264 --> 02:33:29.764]  We're good to go.
[02:33:29.804 --> 02:33:29.944]  I think?
[02:33:47.074 --> 02:33:50.515]  Should not be changed for light and transient causes.
[02:33:50.895 --> 02:34:04.220]  And accordingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
[02:34:05.091 --> 02:34:20.656]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, invents a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, and boy, if that ain't what we're under right now, I don't know what.
[02:34:20.856 --> 02:34:21.556]  That's where we're going.
[02:34:22.016 --> 02:34:30.679]  It is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
[02:34:32.285 --> 02:34:43.195]  Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.
[02:34:43.696 --> 02:34:55.627]  The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.
[02:34:56.889 --> 02:35:01.391]  To prove this fact, let us be submitted to a candid world.
[02:35:01.811 --> 02:35:05.773]  Again, to prove this fact, be submitted to a candid world.
[02:35:06.233 --> 02:35:12.675]  He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for public good.
[02:35:12.916 --> 02:35:14.676]  Again, he doesn't follow his own laws.
[02:35:14.696 --> 02:35:16.037]  He just does whatever he wants.
[02:35:16.557 --> 02:35:20.779]  He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance.
[02:35:21.319 --> 02:35:21.899]  Open borders.
[02:35:21.939 --> 02:35:22.620]  Won't do anything about it.
[02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:23.340]  Unless...
[02:35:24.691 --> 02:35:27.932]  Suspended in their operation until his assent should be obtained.
[02:35:28.172 --> 02:35:32.234]  See, it's like Bush signs bills now and says, we won't execute this if I don't want to.
[02:35:32.414 --> 02:35:35.435]  So just vetoing it, and then two-thirds of the Congress should overturn that.
[02:35:35.475 --> 02:35:39.357]  No, he just says, no, I'm going to sign it, but I'll tell the bureaucracy what to do.
[02:35:39.417 --> 02:35:42.558]  He just makes law by his statements, which presidents don't do.
[02:35:43.118 --> 02:35:47.360]  And when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.
[02:35:48.010 --> 02:35:48.791]  We're good to go.
[02:36:00.507 --> 02:36:04.730]  A right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.
[02:36:05.271 --> 02:36:15.998]  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of the public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.
[02:36:16.078 --> 02:36:17.179]  Now, same thing.
[02:36:17.239 --> 02:36:28.267]  These regional boards, these unelected boards, the WTO, the IMF, the World Bank, they have governmental power signed over by the executive in treaties, and then we have no control over our own lives.
[02:36:29.321 --> 02:36:31.224]  There's many other countless parallels to all of this.
[02:36:31.264 --> 02:36:39.797]  He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing, with mainly firmness, his invasions of the rights of the people.
[02:36:41.585 --> 02:36:53.170]  He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected, whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise.
[02:36:53.490 --> 02:37:01.153]  So, see, they're saying, you have let tyranny run rampant and your bureaucrats run rampant and do all this, and so you say we don't have any power.
[02:37:01.173 --> 02:37:02.033]  Well, that's not true.
[02:37:02.273 --> 02:37:03.474]  It reverses to us.
[02:37:03.894 --> 02:37:05.975]  We all always have the innate power.
[02:37:06.852 --> 02:37:13.335]  The state remaining in the meantime exposed to all dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within.
[02:37:13.355 --> 02:37:16.617]  Again, open borders, internationalism, all of it.
[02:37:17.017 --> 02:37:23.620]  He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states from the purpose of obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners.
[02:37:23.961 --> 02:37:25.441]  He wouldn't let more Europeans in.
[02:37:25.822 --> 02:37:34.806]  Refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither and raising the conditions of new applications and appropriations of lands.
[02:37:34.846 --> 02:37:36.467]  Wouldn't let people expand westward.
[02:37:36.987 --> 02:37:43.412]  He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
[02:37:43.832 --> 02:37:51.237]  He has made judges dependent on his will alone, oh boy, that's happening now, for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries.
[02:37:51.757 --> 02:38:02.565]  He has erected a multitude of new offices, boy, isn't that the government, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance with fines and fees and regulations, I add.
[02:38:03.730 --> 02:38:03.950]  I think?
[02:38:23.274 --> 02:38:26.095]  International Treaty and Mercantilism.
[02:38:26.115 --> 02:38:31.337]  And unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.
[02:38:31.677 --> 02:38:34.198]  Fiat, color of law garbage.
[02:38:35.699 --> 02:38:38.420]  For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.
[02:38:39.542 --> 02:38:42.364]  For protecting them by mock trial from punishment.
[02:38:42.444 --> 02:38:44.066]  Ruby Ridge, Waco, on and on and on.
[02:38:44.626 --> 02:38:48.749]  For murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states.
[02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:51.091]  It goes on and on from page to page.
[02:38:51.611 --> 02:38:54.133]  For cutting off trade with all parts of the world.
[02:38:54.574 --> 02:38:56.535]  Well, that was the reverse of what's now happening.
[02:38:56.856 --> 02:38:58.397]  Now they're flooding us with slave goods.
[02:38:59.057 --> 02:39:01.260]  For imposing taxes on us without our consent.
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:06.425]  For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury, now happening in America and England.
[02:39:06.685 --> 02:39:09.768]  For transporting us beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offenses.
[02:39:10.309 --> 02:39:12.170]  Guantanamo, folks, many other places.
[02:39:12.251 --> 02:39:15.494]  Our citizens being sent overseas to be tried for hate laws they violated here.
[02:39:16.391 --> 02:39:18.572]  Hate laws of foreign countries being retroactive here.
[02:39:41.184 --> 02:39:46.418]  For suspending our legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate
[02:39:47.205 --> 02:39:50.347]  For us in all cases from the executive, which is what they're doing.
[02:39:50.727 --> 02:39:55.989]  He has advocated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.
[02:39:56.249 --> 02:40:01.032]  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, destroyed the lives of our people.
[02:40:01.272 --> 02:40:04.693]  He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries.
[02:40:05.094 --> 02:40:07.155]  Oh man, oh man, exact things happening.
[02:40:07.535 --> 02:40:15.218]  Already 24% of the troops in Iraq are Latin American, Mexican troops, Dutch troops, running, firefighting, are in New Orleans.
[02:40:15.238 --> 02:40:16.279]  It's all setting the precedent.
[02:40:17.498 --> 02:40:32.648]  He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny already begun with the circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely parallel in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy to head of a civilized nation.
[02:40:32.668 --> 02:40:36.350]  See, because this was all signed and done when the fighting had already been going on for months.
[02:40:37.538 --> 02:40:47.009]  He has constrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high siege to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.
[02:40:48.567 --> 02:41:06.323]  Excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored, exactly, race war, and playing everybody off against each other, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages whose known rule of warfare is the undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.
[02:41:06.603 --> 02:41:15.511]  And again, folks, I'm against what happened to Native Americans, but it isn't like that they weren't the majority then and that the Brits weren't hiring them to just go in and kill whole villages, okay?
[02:41:16.781 --> 02:41:16.921]  I think.
[02:41:45.672 --> 02:41:46.032]  Over us.
[02:41:46.533 --> 02:41:47.373]  International law.
[02:41:47.713 --> 02:41:52.495]  We have reminded them of the circumstances of our immigration and settlement here.
[02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:57.258]  We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity.
[02:41:57.618 --> 02:42:09.844]  And we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interpret our connections and correspondence.
[02:42:09.884 --> 02:42:12.845]  They too have been deaf to the voice of justice.
[02:42:13.866 --> 02:42:14.706]  We must therefore...
[02:42:15.638 --> 02:42:23.408]  Acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war.
[02:42:24.149 --> 02:42:25.371]  In peace, friends.
[02:42:26.764 --> 02:42:56.233]  We therefore, the representatives of the United States of America and General Congress, assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions to do in the name by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies are of right and ought to be free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, who runs our country today, folks, same fight, and that all politics...
[02:42:57.162 --> 02:43:16.247]  ...connections between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved, and that as a free and independent state, they have full power to levy war against you trash, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.
[02:43:16.647 --> 02:43:26.669]  And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes,
[02:43:26.949 --> 02:43:28.330]  In our sacred honor.
[02:43:28.911 --> 02:43:29.671]  Amen to that.
[02:43:29.951 --> 02:43:34.275]  And I call for another Declaration of Independence against the enemy!
[02:43:37.637 --> 02:43:39.119]  Okay, now let's talk about Iran.
[02:43:39.579 --> 02:43:40.199]  See, they liked it.
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:44.223]  The British would team up with their French cousins, their Norman cousins, routinely.
[02:43:44.443 --> 02:43:45.504]  The letters are now public.
[02:43:45.804 --> 02:43:47.205]  And say, oh, we're having problems at home.
[02:43:47.225 --> 02:43:48.086]  Let's have a war.
[02:43:50.468 --> 02:43:53.050]  And the Brits even kept Brittany and France.
[02:43:53.090 --> 02:43:54.951]  And they would just have these hundred-year wars.
[02:43:55.031 --> 02:43:56.012]  It's just staged.
[02:43:57.688 --> 02:43:58.569]  It's just staged.
[02:44:00.610 --> 02:44:03.531]  Americans believe Iran is the biggest threat to the U.S.
[02:44:03.571 --> 02:44:04.652]  Now, this will be a real war.
[02:44:05.132 --> 02:44:11.436]  Americans believe Iran poses the greatest danger to the United States, followed by China, Iraq, and South Korea.
[02:44:11.956 --> 02:44:18.720]  According to a poll, this is an article out of UPI.
[02:44:19.521 --> 02:44:21.182]  I got another one here out of AFP.
[02:44:22.382 --> 02:44:23.583]  How dumb.
[02:44:23.983 --> 02:44:25.144]  That's got to be a typo.
[02:44:26.179 --> 02:44:27.640]  AFP, French News Agency.
[02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:30.140]  Agency French Press, however you say it.
[02:44:31.441 --> 02:44:32.861]  I've got to go get the actual poll numbers.
[02:44:32.921 --> 02:44:33.681]  I bet that's true.
[02:44:33.762 --> 02:44:34.842]  It's probably not a typo.
[02:44:37.683 --> 02:44:39.423]  They probably don't know what North and South Korea are.
[02:44:39.443 --> 02:44:41.364]  This is crazy.
[02:44:41.764 --> 02:44:47.146]  Americans believe Iran poses the greatest danger to the United States, followed by China, Iraq, and South Korea.
[02:44:47.226 --> 02:44:50.687]  According to a poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press,
[02:44:51.227 --> 02:44:57.850]  Iran's nuclear program, which the West suspects is weapons-oriented, is considered by far the biggest threat to the U.S.
[02:44:58.150 --> 02:45:04.073]  by 65% of 1,502 people surveyed in the February 1st through 5th poll.
[02:45:04.833 --> 02:45:09.515]  72% believe that Israel would be the target of Iranian nuclear weapons should they come into being.
[02:45:09.535 --> 02:45:12.596]  Yeah, and face virtual annihilation with Israel's 400 nukes.
[02:45:13.717 --> 02:45:18.259]  While 66% believe Europe and the United States would most likely fall under the mushroom cloud.
[02:45:18.982 --> 02:45:24.745]  And 53% through the United States was dictating too much of its time to the Iranian nuclear issue.
[02:45:25.325 --> 02:45:29.447]  72% of the United Nations should take the lead, and 51% the European Union.
[02:45:30.148 --> 02:45:35.890]  North Korea's nuclear program merited 60% danger rating, followed by China as an emerging power.
[02:45:36.151 --> 02:45:43.074]  So at least Americans get a little bit of it, because they say North later, so that must be a typo in the translation.
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:48.963]  At least 60% know that the real threat is North Korea and China.
[02:45:49.864 --> 02:45:51.085]  But they think that's number two.
[02:45:52.246 --> 02:45:56.108]  Iran is way down the line, boys and girls, if there are real threats.
[02:45:56.409 --> 02:46:00.351]  Number one is the Military-Industrial Complex Crime Syndicate, the Royal Crime Syndicate.
[02:46:01.252 --> 02:46:03.093]  They haven't been in power for hundreds of years for nothing.
[02:46:03.113 --> 02:46:03.614]  They're ruthless.
[02:46:03.634 --> 02:46:04.074]  They're cunning.
[02:46:04.254 --> 02:46:06.896]  They know you're naive, and they're going to do bad things to you unless you wake up.
[02:46:07.296 --> 02:46:07.737]  Real simple.
[02:46:08.677 --> 02:46:09.758]  And that won't change the facts, folks.
[02:46:09.778 --> 02:46:10.799]  You can deny it all day long.
[02:46:11.119 --> 02:46:12.320]  Then number two is China.
[02:46:13.288 --> 02:46:14.509]  Number three is North Korea.
[02:46:14.569 --> 02:46:19.210]  Probably North Korea could almost be number one, because Kim Jong-il really is running things, and he's a total psychopath.
[02:46:19.630 --> 02:46:20.511]  A demonic dwarf.
[02:46:22.692 --> 02:46:24.252]  So I kind of vacillate there.
[02:46:24.292 --> 02:46:29.194]  I mean, China's openly saying they'll nuke us and destroy us in official press releases.
[02:46:29.334 --> 02:46:34.516]  So, Iran will not have a nuke conservatively for three years.
[02:46:36.097 --> 02:46:37.337]  I should say liberally.
[02:46:37.597 --> 02:46:42.499]  The most extreme analysis that is based on reality is three years of totally left to their own devices.
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:46.721]  Ten years, what the CIA's own reports say.
[02:46:47.341 --> 02:46:52.243]  But Dick Cheney will get on TV and say that they're going to get nukes in the next few months, so it must be true.
[02:46:53.243 --> 02:46:54.663]  Clearly, Iran's trying to get a nuke.
[02:46:56.284 --> 02:47:04.866]  They look at North Korea, who runs around threatening to nuke everyone and shoots a test missile in 99, or was it early 2000, that actually hit Alaska, a dummy missile.
[02:47:05.186 --> 02:47:06.787]  Mainstream news, but never in our news.
[02:47:08.207 --> 02:47:11.168]  Kept very quiet here, but all over the European and South Korean press.
[02:47:12.172 --> 02:47:17.354]  They fired dummy missiles, what, four times now at Japan that crashed just a few miles off their coast.
[02:47:19.455 --> 02:47:20.495]  This is what they're doing.
[02:47:21.335 --> 02:47:24.296]  We have people firing dummy missiles that are hitting our country.
[02:47:26.017 --> 02:47:27.417]  And we've got to worry about Iran.
[02:47:28.698 --> 02:47:30.838]  Diplomacy, Iran can be worked with.
[02:47:30.878 --> 02:47:31.839]  The globalists don't want that.
[02:47:31.859 --> 02:47:32.619]  They want a fight.
[02:47:33.248 --> 02:47:35.809]  Because they can shut down any type of domestic arguing.
[02:47:36.129 --> 02:47:40.369]  They can feed the military-industrial complex through their private defense contractor coffers.
[02:47:41.070 --> 02:47:43.550]  And they can set up their new world order.
[02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:47.171]  And it's going to be your sons and daughters that are going to die in this.
[02:47:47.391 --> 02:47:48.231]  None of it is needed.
[02:47:49.051 --> 02:47:51.292]  Iran is run by a bunch of lunatics.
[02:47:52.072 --> 02:47:54.732]  Governments are normally run by lunatic, out-of-control people.
[02:47:55.192 --> 02:47:57.593]  But the out-of-control lunatics over there are nothing.
[02:47:58.769 --> 02:48:01.511]  Iran isn't putting cancer viruses in their population's vaccines.
[02:48:01.732 --> 02:48:03.353]  They don't fluoridate their water, boys and girls.
[02:48:03.373 --> 02:48:03.653]  They don't.
[02:48:04.054 --> 02:48:07.056]  They are, by the way, have rules banning aspartame over there.
[02:48:07.256 --> 02:48:09.378]  You know, they actually care about their population.
[02:48:09.578 --> 02:48:13.682]  They see their population as kind of like their cattle, but they want to take care of their cows.
[02:48:14.683 --> 02:48:23.190]  The globalists over here are a bunch of Malthusian, social Darwinistic nut freaks who are openly saying they want to kill 85-95% of us in policy reports.
[02:48:24.173 --> 02:48:29.077]  So, understand, I'm not saying, you know, when the globalists say China's a threat, yes, they are.
[02:48:29.337 --> 02:48:30.058]  But who armed them?
[02:48:30.198 --> 02:48:33.461]  Same thing with North Korea, Rumsfeld, as usual.
[02:48:33.921 --> 02:48:36.763]  Come back, take a few final calls, wrap up this transmission.
[02:48:36.823 --> 02:48:38.305]  What a broadcast today.
[02:48:38.585 --> 02:48:40.046]  Stay with us.
[02:48:44.329 --> 02:48:47.172]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:47.919 --> 02:48:49.200]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:55.144]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:55.424 --> 02:49:00.667]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:00.967 --> 02:49:05.070]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[02:49:05.290 --> 02:49:20.304]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged, witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, proofs on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.364 --> 02:49:22.186]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:49:22.666 --> 02:49:24.748]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.

[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.482]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:43.809 --> 02:49:47.710]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:49:47.930 --> 02:49:53.371]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:49:53.631 --> 02:50:03.993]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:50:04.173 --> 02:50:08.494]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:50:08.694 --> 02:50:12.295]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[02:50:12.395 --> 02:50:17.118]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:17.318 --> 02:50:17.558]  That's AAA.
[02:50:40.572 --> 02:50:41.192]  We're good to go.
[02:51:00.442 --> 02:51:01.083]  We're good to go.
[02:51:20.677 --> 02:51:21.298]  We're good to go.
[02:51:46.087 --> 02:51:52.131]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:52.732 --> 02:51:55.754]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.675 --> 02:52:01.058]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:52:01.498 --> 02:52:03.860]  A lot of new specials, a lot of new videos and books.
[02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:08.503]  Books on tape, t-shirts that we've got at theinfowars.com, video on bookstore.
[02:52:08.563 --> 02:52:12.906]  Order your hard copies there today or get a membership for 15 cents a day at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:52:12.946 --> 02:52:14.767]  We've got Dylan Avery's new 9-11...
[02:52:15.988 --> 02:52:16.668]  Loose Change 2.
[02:52:17.289 --> 02:52:20.830]  He authorizes us to post that up there, and it's really great.
[02:52:21.090 --> 02:52:25.392]  We just posted the Tex Mars interview, and now the interview with David Stahl is going up there.
[02:52:25.432 --> 02:52:27.693]  The Sully Costello interview is going up there next week.
[02:52:28.073 --> 02:52:32.635]  And then we're going to have an Iraq reporter, photojournalist in her studio tomorrow.
[02:52:33.215 --> 02:52:35.897]  And then we're going to have Robert Galen Ronson here in studio on Friday.
[02:52:35.917 --> 02:52:51.885]  And again, we can put these up pretty much in a day or so, unedited, but we cut out all the breaks or all the side issues or the plugs, and we add in some documents and photos and then spice up the audio for you, and then we post those as little reports for prisonplanet.tv members.
[02:52:52.085 --> 02:52:52.966]  Another reason to join.
[02:52:53.526 --> 02:52:58.489]  All my films are there, by the way, and it's a great activist center to download these interviews and burn them to DVD and give them to folks or disc.
[02:52:59.329 --> 02:53:00.450]  Let's quickly go to calls.
[02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:02.651]  Let's talk to John in California.
[02:53:02.691 --> 02:53:03.331]  John, go ahead.
[02:53:03.351 --> 02:53:04.351]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:04.391 --> 02:53:05.732]  Great to be on your show.
[02:53:06.212 --> 02:53:07.173]  New listener here.
[02:53:07.193 --> 02:53:07.553]  Welcome.
[02:53:07.773 --> 02:53:08.513]  I can't get enough.
[02:53:08.773 --> 02:53:10.334]  You just, like, energize my whole day.
[02:53:10.354 --> 02:53:21.699]  So, I had a comment about Albert Gonzalez when he was testifying, and I just seem to recall back in late September 2001... Yeah, he wouldn't say he was against torture.
[02:53:21.739 --> 02:53:24.300]  He wouldn't renege on saying they're allowed to kill people.
[02:53:25.001 --> 02:53:25.461]  That, too.
[02:53:26.181 --> 02:53:27.322]  But also, he was talking about...
[02:53:28.587 --> 02:53:29.728]  You know, monitoring calls.
[02:53:29.768 --> 02:53:33.752]  And the FBI, I remember, they said there was like 5,000 Al-Qaeda operatives in the U.S.
[02:53:33.812 --> 02:53:35.113]  directly after the attacks.
[02:53:35.834 --> 02:53:39.577]  Since that time, we've had, what, no prosecutions, maybe about a dozen arrests.
[02:53:40.418 --> 02:53:44.021]  It's just like a real false information that went up a long time ago.
[02:53:44.041 --> 02:53:50.107]  Well, that's because Moussaoui started saying, hey, I was involved with the government, and they said, that's it, he can't talk, you're not allowed to talk, we're not going to try him now.
[02:53:50.854 --> 02:53:51.294]  That's right.
[02:53:51.374 --> 02:53:52.675]  Keep him in a naval brig!
[02:53:54.956 --> 02:53:57.678]  I just, you know, it keeps going on and on.
[02:53:57.698 --> 02:54:02.861]  There's always the news reports, and then people just have a, their memory just lapses.
[02:54:02.881 --> 02:54:08.804]  They just don't go back and look at what was said in the newspapers, and so, you know, that's part of what I appreciate from you.
[02:54:09.365 --> 02:54:10.525]  You're always vigilant.
[02:54:10.605 --> 02:54:15.348]  Well, if I was the general public, I would be really upset and scared that total criminals are in control.
[02:54:15.388 --> 02:54:16.689]  I mean, you can't deny it.
[02:54:17.432 --> 02:54:20.476]  And no amount of ball games or Budweiser is going to wash that away.
[02:54:20.496 --> 02:54:21.798]  I mean, this is real.
[02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:22.518]  We're facing it.
[02:54:22.539 --> 02:54:24.020]  We don't want to end up like Nazi Germany.
[02:54:24.221 --> 02:54:25.182]  We can stop it.
[02:54:26.544 --> 02:54:27.965]  Hey, Alex, when are you getting on your road tour?
[02:54:28.045 --> 02:54:30.669]  Are you going to take a bus out and go to different stadiums?
[02:54:31.069 --> 02:54:32.391]  You know, I've done the math.
[02:54:33.430 --> 02:54:36.413]  Well, I could probably go to a lot of towns and get 500 or 1,000 people out in each town.
[02:54:36.433 --> 02:54:37.614]  I'm not big enough to do that.
[02:54:39.176 --> 02:54:40.517]  Number one, I've done the math.
[02:54:40.557 --> 02:54:43.040]  I can sit in my house and do radio interviews.
[02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:45.703]  And I go out and confront people and do interviews and travel around.
[02:54:45.723 --> 02:54:46.684]  I mean, I can go all over.
[02:54:47.124 --> 02:54:49.026]  But I just have to do it on the weekends.
[02:54:49.186 --> 02:54:53.491]  When I went to England, I was there three days because I didn't want to miss the radio show and the work here.
[02:54:54.051 --> 02:55:00.354]  I mean, I can do two or three radio interviews a day and reach millions and then do my own show or go have that personal thing.
[02:55:00.374 --> 02:55:03.195]  And a lot of people do it because they are egomaniacs.
[02:55:03.215 --> 02:55:04.776]  I'm not saying it's bad to be on road trips.
[02:55:05.316 --> 02:55:07.057]  It's just that they really get off on it.
[02:55:07.177 --> 02:55:10.399]  They don't connect with large populations over the microphone.
[02:55:10.799 --> 02:55:12.800]  They connect with it at a simian level.
[02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:15.922]  I'm the big monkey up in front of all the other people.
[02:55:15.942 --> 02:55:17.122]  Ooka, ooka, ooka.
[02:55:17.423 --> 02:55:17.963]  I'm big.
[02:55:18.223 --> 02:55:19.404]  And so they just get off on it.
[02:55:19.424 --> 02:55:24.147]  I've seen so many people just go wild when there's a crowd of people in front of them and are just on power trips.
[02:55:24.427 --> 02:55:25.388]  It does nothing for me.
[02:55:26.088 --> 02:55:29.890]  I like being able to meet and talk to people, but at the same time, all the, oh, you're so great.
[02:55:30.371 --> 02:55:31.551]  Just, I can't handle it.
[02:55:31.772 --> 02:55:33.513]  Listen, thanks a lot, bro, and take care.
[02:55:33.973 --> 02:55:35.734]  I'm sorry to Jiami.
[02:55:36.254 --> 02:55:37.315]  Oh, let's talk to Jiami.
[02:55:37.375 --> 02:55:38.256]  I'm sorry to the other callers.
[02:55:38.276 --> 02:55:39.756]  If I'm pronouncing that right.
[02:55:40.017 --> 02:55:40.917]  Caller from Maryland.
[02:55:40.937 --> 02:55:41.718]  You're our tail gunner.
[02:55:41.738 --> 02:55:42.078]  Go ahead.
[02:55:42.398 --> 02:55:42.918]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:42.958 --> 02:55:43.578]  How are you?
[02:55:43.678 --> 02:55:43.978]  Good.
[02:55:44.799 --> 02:55:45.499]  Quick question.
[02:55:45.619 --> 02:55:50.880]  Alex, you and I both do radio shows, and we try to get people to get off their butts and do things.
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:53.021]  We're going to cut down the Internet pretty soon.
[02:55:53.101 --> 02:55:53.821]  What can we do?
[02:55:54.821 --> 02:55:59.343]  We expose how they're trying to shut down the net, openly saying it at their big conventions.
[02:55:59.883 --> 02:56:00.983]  That's mainstream news, folks.
[02:56:01.003 --> 02:56:11.606]  They're shutting it down, forcing us onto a new one with no freedom to speak of, and we just expose it, and they've been trying it for a couple years, and so it's going to be really unpopular, so we warn the people.
[02:56:14.039 --> 02:56:15.299]  Tell you what, call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:15.319 --> 02:56:16.000]  I apologize.
[02:56:16.020 --> 02:56:18.020]  You held for 30 minutes and we didn't get to you.
[02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:18.681]  Sorry, everybody else.
[02:56:18.901 --> 02:56:19.701]  God bless you all.
[02:56:19.741 --> 02:56:21.201]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:23.482 --> 02:56:27.384]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[02:56:27.704 --> 02:56:28.484]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
