[00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:04.806]  Strap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:05.848]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.690]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.512]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:25.553]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:29.135]  Call Alex now, toll free, at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.596]  Now, live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:41.739]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:48.124]  I'm glad that you've decided to join us on this, well, beautiful Sunday afternoon here in Central Texas.
[00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:54.129]  We have the Rolling Stones here in town playing tonight, being worshipped by the entire city.
[00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:57.592]  But no, I'm here live on the radio.
[00:00:57.632 --> 00:00:59.754]  We have a very important broadcast lined up for you.
[00:01:00.513 --> 00:01:03.635]  I know of five affiliates that are tuned in to the broadcast today.
[00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:13.842]  Our second broadcast has been syndicated here out of the studios of NewsRadio 590 KLBJ and quite a few new stations that are announcing that they will be turning us on in the next few weeks, so that's exciting.
[00:01:14.222 --> 00:01:26.070]  And if you're listening on any of those affiliates around the country or on the Internet or via satellite or right here in Texas via KLBJ, you are welcome to give us a call toll-free at 877-590-KLBJ.
[00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.072]  I notice the phones are basically loaded up before the broadcast even started.
[00:01:29.512 --> 00:01:34.675]  Okay, I was talking about this three weeks ago, and we're back three weeks later talking about it.
[00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.573]  The Congress three weeks ago passed H.R.
[00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:05.458]  6166, known as the Military Commissions Act, or publicly as the Torture Act.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.984]  And the White House and the media, as usual, have been trying to lie.
[00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.386]  At least some sectors of the media have been lying.
[00:02:14.107 --> 00:02:17.010]  But constitutional scholars on the left and the right...
[00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.354]  Conclusively concur, and I have read the bill, it does affect U.S.
[00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:24.134]  citizens.
[00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:29.760]  But the neocon-controlled media has been outlying saying it doesn't affect U.S.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.984]  citizens, just like they claimed the Patriot Act wouldn't, and then now they admit it does.
[00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:40.811]  And that's because there is a danger of their unconstitutional Constitution Butchering Act, H.R. 6166,
[00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:42.853]  We're good to go.
[00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.660]  I also want to mention a few of the other things we'll be talking about.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.303]  The military has been training for at least 25 years to confiscate the American people's firearms and put us into FEMA camps.
[00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:29.224]  And I've been reporting on this for over 12 years.
[00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:30.824]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:35.766]  It is illegal for the military to be involved in domestic law enforcement activities.
[00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:37.126]  It's the 1878 law, posse commentatus.
[00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.550]  I think.
[00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.750]  I think.
[00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.911]  I think.
[00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:55.557]  We're good to go.
[00:04:23.294 --> 00:04:25.436]  That's why I'm against them breathing depleted uranium.
[00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:33.642]  That's why I'm against them being put in needless wars that are all about defense contractor profits and global domination for the New World Order.
[00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:37.425]  And so people who claim, oh, well, you're against the troops then.
[00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:39.907]  Turn your guns in when they come wanting them.
[00:04:40.187 --> 00:04:43.469]  You show your patriot by turning your firearms in.
[00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.472]  Or, well, let them spy on them hippies.
[00:04:46.532 --> 00:04:50.875]  It's good to have troops in plain clothes spying on Americans.
[00:04:51.528 --> 00:04:52.249]  No, it's not.
[00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.310]  It's East Germany.
[00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.152]  It's Pol Pot's Cambodia.
[00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:58.214]  It's Cuba today.
[00:04:58.274 --> 00:04:59.716]  It's Communist China today.
[00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:00.476]  It's Russia.
[00:05:00.897 --> 00:05:02.038]  This is shameful.
[00:05:02.138 --> 00:05:08.644]  It is the antithesis 180 degrees opposite of what this country is supposed to really be about.
[00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:11.547]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:05:11.827 --> 00:05:13.969]  Also, in an Associated Press article...
[00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:27.271]  Homeland Security Director, a very scary man, Michael Chertoff, whose family members write hit pieces on myself for Popular Mechanics, Benjamin Chertoff, he openly said they need to spy on the web, regulate the web, and regulate free speech.
[00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:28.551]  I have the mainstream article here.
[00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:41.735]  Also have the Times of London, amateur video bloggers under threat from EU broadcast rules that will affect the United States, and they're going to not just ban all videos, making your own video, uploading it to the web.
[00:05:42.195 --> 00:05:42.756]  It could be you...
[00:05:44.316 --> 00:05:45.437]  Making a sawhorse?
[00:05:45.497 --> 00:05:47.779]  Are you firing Estes rockets in your backyard?
[00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.040]  Or fly fishing?
[00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:49.941]  They don't care.
[00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:50.842]  It's not porn.
[00:05:50.882 --> 00:05:51.603]  It's not hate.
[00:05:51.963 --> 00:05:55.907]  It's not all the stuff they wanted to get you trained for censorship in the past.
[00:05:56.307 --> 00:05:57.728]  Now it's just everything.
[00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:01.572]  And that's a move by the big broadcast companies in Europe and the U.S.
[00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:02.948]  In fact, a lot of U.S.
[00:06:03.008 --> 00:06:13.334]  companies are lobbying for this through Europe where there's less rights, but then under treaty obligations we would be under this system because television's in trouble, mainstream print's in trouble.
[00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:29.162]  The only old-line media, as I said last week, that is still holding its own against the new media is talk radio, and that's because it has merged itself with the new media, as you see MS Communications doing right now with my show and what I do.
[00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:39.687]  So we'll be going over all of this as well in the next hour and, what, 48 minutes that we have left.
[00:06:41.048 --> 00:06:44.270]  And then later in the third hour, I'm not really a newsreader.
[00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.552]  I don't like to read two, three pages of text, but I will do it.
[00:06:50.153 --> 00:06:54.956]  Because Pat Tillman's brother, who I have a source and...
[00:06:56.224 --> 00:06:57.145]  I think we're good to go.
[00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:23.857]  At the Central Intelligence Agency, who's a big Republican, just went public saying 9-11's clearly an inside job.
[00:07:24.658 --> 00:07:29.681]  Oh, I'm afraid the criminals that carried out the attacks will be brought to justice.
[00:07:30.202 --> 00:07:32.844]  In fact, I've got that fellow coming on later this week on my weekday show.
[00:07:33.344 --> 00:07:35.725]  And, of course, we'll be covering that here for you next week.
[00:07:35.906 --> 00:07:38.467]  But I do want to later mention a little bit on that, too.
[00:07:38.908 --> 00:07:45.192]  More and more high-level people are actually researching the official story of 9-11 and finding out that it's a fraud and a lie.
[00:07:45.712 --> 00:07:46.233]  Every bit of it.
[00:07:46.493 --> 00:07:50.397]  And then you dig deeper and, oh, surprise, surprise, you find out who really did it.
[00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:56.003]  And it wasn't 19 guys commanded from a cave in Afghanistan, my friends, unfortunately.
[00:07:57.384 --> 00:08:00.708]  Okay, so later the Pat Tillman letter is coming up.
[00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:05.452]  And we're going to be reading it in its entirety.
[00:08:05.472 --> 00:08:08.836]  I think his words are more eloquent and more powerful than anything I can read.
[00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:10.249]  I can put together.
[00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:16.331]  Of course, if you don't know who Pat Tillman was, he was a professional football player making millions of dollars a year with a great future ahead of him.
[00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:18.412]  And his brother was in the Army Rangers.
[00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:21.413]  And so he volunteered for the Army Rangers like his brother.
[00:08:22.093 --> 00:08:25.474]  And there was no Al-Qaeda or Taliban anywhere around.
[00:08:25.574 --> 00:08:26.775]  And they shot him dead.
[00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:28.035]  A friendly fire.
[00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:30.576]  And they decided to lie about it and told everybody to shut up and lie.
[00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:32.997]  And it doesn't just look like...
[00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:36.410]  They changed the story three times and lied about friendly fire.
[00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.294]  Looks like Mr. Tillman saw something he wasn't supposed to see.
[00:08:40.314 --> 00:08:42.476]  There's a lot of opium deals going on.
[00:08:42.496 --> 00:08:44.117]  A lot of government ops going on.
[00:08:44.898 --> 00:08:46.740]  Taliban and Al-Qaeda, RCIA.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.781]  Looks like Mr. Tillman...
[00:08:48.587 --> 00:08:51.308]  Found out some things he wasn't supposed to and got a couple bullets in him.
[00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:55.331]  But we're going to read what his brother has to say coming up.
[00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:56.651]  Again, they volunteered.
[00:08:56.691 --> 00:08:57.252]  They served.
[00:08:57.792 --> 00:09:05.196]  All the pot-bellied neocons driving around out there right now think gun control is conservative and open borders are conservative and North American unions are conservative.
[00:09:05.756 --> 00:09:06.737]  I'm a real conservative.
[00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:08.418]  Pat Tillman's brothers are real conservative.
[00:09:08.838 --> 00:09:10.499]  You are so liberal.
[00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:14.761]  But again, the new wave of liberals are so brainwashed, they don't even know they're liberals.
[00:09:15.422 --> 00:09:17.663]  It's like a body snatcher who doesn't even know they're a body snatcher.
[00:09:17.683 --> 00:09:22.366]  Or maybe like a Blade Runner where the androids don't even know they're androids.
[00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:23.966]  You think you're conservative.
[00:09:24.627 --> 00:09:32.911]  Well, you and George Bush and Uriel and Hillary Clinton who they hang out with and Bill Clinton who they vacation with and they're in business together, none of it's conservative, okay?
[00:09:34.892 --> 00:09:36.773]  And we've already got a bunch of phone calls here.
[00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:41.634]  I'd like you to chime in on the torture legislation for the American people.
[00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:42.535]  Now they're lying about it.
[00:09:42.575 --> 00:09:43.315]  Why are they lying about it?
[00:09:43.335 --> 00:09:44.036]  A bunch of issues.
[00:09:44.056 --> 00:09:44.656]  It's all coming up.
[00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:44.716]  877-590-5525.
[00:09:44.976 --> 00:09:45.917]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:45.937 --> 00:09:46.638]  Stay with us.
[00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:47.018]  Hello.
[00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:08.226]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:13.407]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:16.428]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:20.329]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:25.410]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.050]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.471]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:10:33.251 --> 00:10:35.392]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:10:35.412 --> 00:10:37.213]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:10:37.413 --> 00:10:37.473]  U.S.

[00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:41.515]  Ask for George.
[00:11:00.976 --> 00:11:04.837]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:11:05.037 --> 00:11:17.319]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking a 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:18.139]  The U.S.
[00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:23.760]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.381]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:28.721]  We're good to go.
[00:11:48.968 --> 00:11:49.268]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:01.134 --> 00:12:04.716]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:12:04.977 --> 00:12:05.837]  Look no further.
[00:12:06.137 --> 00:12:08.699]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:17.624]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival and financial freedom to history, politics, conspiracy and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:19.505]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[00:12:19.765 --> 00:12:20.386]  We're good to go.
[00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:36.200]  We're good to go.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:36.600]  We're good to go.
[00:13:02.242 --> 00:13:07.663]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:13:08.104 --> 00:13:12.865]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.846]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:13:16.346 --> 00:13:19.747]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:13:20.527 --> 00:13:24.868]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:13:25.288 --> 00:13:28.469]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:31.930]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:13:32.688 --> 00:13:34.829]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:13:34.869 --> 00:13:36.950]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:37.010]  U.S.
[00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.071]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:13:39.091 --> 00:13:39.431]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:40.272]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:13:40.292 --> 00:13:41.052]  Ask for George.
[00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:03.317]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:14:03.377 --> 00:14:08.939]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:13.922]  Agree or disagree?
[00:14:14.762 --> 00:14:17.603]  Alex wants to hear from you right now at 877-590-5525.
[00:14:17.663 --> 00:14:18.864]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[00:14:28.223 --> 00:14:35.567]  Yeah, I'm actually going to have a liner soon that says, if you disagree with me, you go to the head of the line, 877-590-5525.
[00:14:36.928 --> 00:14:42.331]  That's 877-590-KLBJ, syndicated broadcast, blasting out across the country.
[00:14:42.732 --> 00:14:47.234]  We are so glad that you are joining us on this Sunday edition.
[00:14:47.274 --> 00:14:48.955]  We've got calls all over the map here.
[00:14:48.975 --> 00:14:50.396]  I don't even know what this means.
[00:14:50.436 --> 00:14:53.498]  It says, Alley in North Austin, the Boat Act of 2002.
[00:14:53.618 --> 00:14:54.198]  I plead ignorance.
[00:14:55.966 --> 00:15:01.371]  Adam in New Hampshire wants to talk about a million-man march for 9-11 truth, exposing 9-11 as an inside job.
[00:15:02.232 --> 00:15:06.816]  We've got Corey in Southern California wants to talk about Professor Stephen Jones.
[00:15:07.417 --> 00:15:14.523]  Chris in Montreal, Canada wants to talk about the USS Eisenhower that's now in the Gulf threatening a strike on Iran.
[00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:17.306]  And I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:21.990]  The military has trained to put the American people in camps and take our guns.
[00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:33.532]  And this is now mainstream news, but I mean, a decade ago, I would go to Urban Warfare Drills, where they had role players screaming, I'm an American, please, no, not the camp, I have Second Amendment rights.
[00:15:33.992 --> 00:15:36.353]  Now, is that what you want your military doing?
[00:15:36.673 --> 00:15:37.973]  Why are they training for that?
[00:15:38.033 --> 00:15:41.674]  And why is NORTHCOM, your new military command over the U.S.
[00:15:41.734 --> 00:15:47.596]  and FEMA, saying, quote, they're now operational, ready to go operational inside the United States?
[00:15:47.716 --> 00:15:49.217]  Oh, if there's another big terror attack...
[00:15:49.577 --> 00:15:50.358]  We're good to go.
[00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:10.686]  Might as well take your private property while we're at it.
[00:16:10.706 --> 00:16:12.746]  You know, Supreme Court ruling, that fights Al-Qaeda too.
[00:16:13.366 --> 00:16:15.727]  And anybody who criticizes the government is aiding the terrorists.
[00:16:15.747 --> 00:16:18.888]  So I'm glad that Bush passed H.R.
[00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:18.888]  6166.
[00:16:19.788 --> 00:16:21.949]  Here is the cover of The Statesman.
[00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:25.650]  And this came out today, and it says...
[00:16:28.012 --> 00:16:32.417]  The strange thing is that we have become sort of constitutional couch potatoes.
[00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:44.311]  The Congress just gave the President despotic power, and you could hear the yawn across the country as people turned to Dancing with the Stars, It's Otherworldly.
[00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:53.332]  And he's just one of the constitutional law scholars that has gone public and who has been breaking down exactly what this H.R.
[00:16:53.352 --> 00:16:57.854]  6166, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, does.
[00:16:58.254 --> 00:17:09.459]  And it states that if you don't show total allegiance to, quote, the government and the executive, as a citizen you can be seized and secretly held and secretly executed.
[00:17:10.114 --> 00:17:12.855]  And it states if you damage property, this can happen to you.
[00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:15.637]  There's no habeas corpus, no due process.
[00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:16.917]  It's not even a real trial.
[00:17:17.278 --> 00:17:17.958]  It's secret.
[00:17:18.218 --> 00:17:23.441]  And even if the tribunal finds you not guilty, by the way, they can use evidence from torture on you.
[00:17:25.142 --> 00:17:31.905]  But again, even if they find you not guilty, they can still continue to hold you.
[00:17:32.205 --> 00:17:35.927]  But again, this is to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:36.886 --> 00:17:47.108]  And there's now this spin machine going from the fake conservatives and liberals that run this country, because they're not real conservatives, saying, oh, it doesn't affect citizens, it's only enemy combatants.
[00:17:47.209 --> 00:18:01.672]  But then we have the filings by the Justice Department to Congress and the memos they wrote, and what they codified into this law, the instant the President, the Defense Secretary, or any of his designates designate you an enemy combatant,
[00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:03.000]  Blank check.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.703]  Then you are no longer a citizen.
[00:18:06.143 --> 00:18:09.547]  So when they say, well, we can only do this to non-citizens, it's true.
[00:18:10.147 --> 00:18:15.793]  Because they instantly revoke your citizenship, and you are guilty until proven innocent.
[00:18:16.173 --> 00:18:20.298]  In fact, you read this bill, it keeps saying, we hold the terrorist until the trial.
[00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:24.422]  You see, it's guilty until proven innocent.
[00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:27.582]  And people say, well, it's a tough war on terror.
[00:18:27.622 --> 00:18:28.703]  We've got to get tough.
[00:18:29.063 --> 00:18:30.324]  Anything to stop them.
[00:18:30.984 --> 00:18:39.528]  Like leaving the border wide open and that fake fence they're not even building and the 6,000 troops they never sent to the border and 2,000 less Border Patrol than we had in 2001.
[00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:41.249]  It is smoke and mirrors.
[00:18:41.349 --> 00:18:42.470]  It is not real.
[00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:47.352]  So we'll be going over that in more detail as well.
[00:18:47.412 --> 00:18:49.013]  Let's just go ahead and go to some of the calls.
[00:18:49.073 --> 00:18:50.994]  I don't even know where to start here.
[00:18:51.014 --> 00:18:51.194]  Let's...
[00:18:51.704 --> 00:18:59.110]  Let's go ahead and start close to home in North Austin and talk to Allie and find out exactly what the BOAT Act is.
[00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.031]  It's probably a question for me, but I don't know what it is.
[00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.932]  Welcome to the airwaves, Allie.
[00:19:03.093 --> 00:19:11.139]  Yes, the IEEE Spectrum Journal for 2006, October, has a four-page article that reminded me of you.
[00:19:11.219 --> 00:19:12.960]  It's called The Next Voting Debacle.
[00:19:13.658 --> 00:19:16.199]  Apparently there was the Help America Vote Act of 2006.
[00:19:16.499 --> 00:19:18.380]  Okay, you said Help America Vote Act.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.781]  I know exactly what that is.
[00:19:19.821 --> 00:19:21.441]  I don't know what the Vote Act is.
[00:19:21.501 --> 00:19:22.362]  Well, that's what it's called.
[00:19:22.382 --> 00:19:23.902]  That's what was on my screen.
[00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:25.823]  Sure, it's the Help America Vote Act.
[00:19:25.923 --> 00:19:29.205]  And it took effect in January 2006.
[00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:31.706]  Well, what did you take away from the article?
[00:19:31.726 --> 00:19:36.208]  I mean, I could give you my take on the Help America... My take is that there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be disfranchised.
[00:19:36.228 --> 00:19:38.829]  They won't find out about it until the day of the election because...
[00:19:39.642 --> 00:19:40.302]  Well, absolutely.
[00:19:40.322 --> 00:19:42.983]  My real problem with the Help America Vote Act is it was $6.3 billion dollars
[00:20:05.379 --> 00:20:06.139]  We're good to go.
[00:20:36.497 --> 00:20:42.060]  But he owned the company that 80-plus percent of the votes were cast on, so Senator Hagel magically won.
[00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:44.201]  And it's the same thing.
[00:20:44.882 --> 00:21:05.192]  Interestingly enough, Clear Channel, actually, Lowry Mays owns Hart Inner Civics, and that's the big voting machine company that over 80 percent, again, that number, of the votes cast in Hayes, Travis, and Williamson County for Congressman Michael McCaul, who's married to Lowry Mays' daughter.
[00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:08.354]  The head of Clear Channel, the owner of Heart InterCivics.
[00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:12.439]  And Heart InterCivics, of course, it isn't just that.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.463]  Laura Mays is also the biggest contributor to Michael McCall.
[00:21:15.824 --> 00:21:19.689]  And hey, I mean, I'm sure Michael McCall is wildly popular here in the...
[00:21:20.732 --> 00:21:22.033]  Liberal Travis County.
[00:21:22.113 --> 00:21:23.834]  Maybe Williamson and Hayes did swing it for him.
[00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:30.258]  All I'm saying is, kind of a conflict of interest when your father-in-law owns a voting machine company and is your biggest campaign contributor.
[00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:32.039]  But hey, what do I know?
[00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:36.842]  I'm sure everything's completely kosher and wonderful with that.
[00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:50.546]  Doesn't matter if Diebold, admittedly, has had, what, nine separate felons working in it, as high as vice presidents, and running entire election systems, and the owner of Diebold, the chairman of Diebold, said he would deliver the electoral votes in Ohio.
[00:21:50.846 --> 00:21:52.366]  It was clear fraud there in 2004.
[00:21:52.846 --> 00:21:53.907]  Again, I'm not a Democrat.
[00:21:54.087 --> 00:21:57.347]  I believe Kerry was corrupt and bad as well, because you can't just steal the election.
[00:21:57.367 --> 00:21:59.628]  You've also got to have a candidate who takes a dive.
[00:21:59.988 --> 00:22:01.869]  Of course, people agree with me now in major polls, 90%.
[00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:03.729]  We're good to go.
[00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.491]  It's just going to get worse and worse.
[00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:37.536]  There's going to be all sorts of problems, and there's no record of how you voted, and there's secret wireless software, and okay, company engineers have gone public, and so they were hired to design it for hacking and fraud, but let's just ignore it.
[00:22:37.576 --> 00:22:38.657]  The Fed's paid for it.
[00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:43.279]  It doesn't matter if three of the big companies are run by former CIA directors or former NSA directors.
[00:22:43.639 --> 00:22:44.200]  It's safe.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.340]  It's wonderful.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:45.940]  Just trust it.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.301]  It doesn't matter who casts the vote.
[00:22:47.341 --> 00:22:48.001]  It's who counts it.
[00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:49.142]  So, Stalin said.
[00:22:49.342 --> 00:22:50.683]  We'll be right back with your call.
[00:22:50.723 --> 00:22:51.163]  Stay with us.
[00:23:01.225 --> 00:23:06.647]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the US have diabetes.
[00:23:06.987 --> 00:23:13.929]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:23:14.069 --> 00:23:18.591]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:21.612]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.
[00:23:21.772 --> 00:23:28.694]  This is why, as your trusted online partner in health, we are committed to bringing you products that help you make informed decisions about your health.

[00:24:00.952 --> 00:24:05.000]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.607]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:24:08.808 --> 00:24:12.275]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:24:12.515 --> 00:24:15.778]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:24:15.798 --> 00:24:21.262]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:24:21.302 --> 00:24:30.929]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.371]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:37.835]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead-on.
[00:24:38.334 --> 00:24:42.756]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:24:42.776 --> 00:24:44.216]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:24:44.376 --> 00:24:48.258]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:24:48.298 --> 00:24:49.118]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.402]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[00:25:03.722 --> 00:25:05.923]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[00:25:06.243 --> 00:25:07.944]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.

[00:25:25.834 --> 00:25:28.276]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[00:25:28.356 --> 00:25:33.641]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[00:25:33.841 --> 00:25:37.344]  The Total Transformation will help you solve even the worst behavior problems.

[00:27:13.274 --> 00:27:16.157]  You're experiencing Alex Jones.
[00:27:17.558 --> 00:27:20.040]  Live from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:27:21.041 --> 00:27:26.807]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:27:27.808 --> 00:27:30.230]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[00:27:32.472 --> 00:27:36.376]  Thank you so much for joining us again on this live Sunday edition.
[00:27:38.163 --> 00:27:57.827]  Coming up, I'm going to read in its entirety a letter that Pat Tillman's brother who also served with him in Afghanistan and other areas of the Middle East and Central Asia about the fraud of this war and the lies and crimes committed by this government mindlessly following what a little neocon is doing.
[00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.452]  A puppet of the Global Crime Syndicate is not patriotic.
[00:28:01.472 --> 00:28:05.814]  We'll be covering it more on the Military Commissions Act affecting U.S.
[00:28:05.854 --> 00:28:14.180]  citizens and the attempt by the media to now spin that because they're afraid that the people will push for a repeal if they learn what is actually in it.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:21.404]  And I want to cover how the Pentagon is manipulating our media, engaging in propaganda domestically, and spying on the American people.
[00:28:22.344 --> 00:28:26.307]  And hey, if you want to call and say, Hey, buddy, what, you don't like our military?
[00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:31.214]  You ought to slit your throat and let the government drink your blood if you're patriotic.
[00:28:32.095 --> 00:28:34.637]  You ought to fall down and worship government.
[00:28:34.657 --> 00:28:36.279]  That's how they do it in China.
[00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:38.061]  That's how you're patriotic.
[00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:39.662]  No, it's not patriotic.
[00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:43.566]  It's not freedom to have troops spying on the American people.
[00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:46.202]  Spying on groups that are against the draft.
[00:28:46.242 --> 00:28:48.303]  That's here in the Houston Chronicle in front of me.
[00:28:48.763 --> 00:28:51.324]  That's spying on groups that go protest the war.
[00:28:51.724 --> 00:28:53.865]  That's spying on groups that protest Halliburton.
[00:28:54.085 --> 00:29:00.228]  I'm talking about soccer moms, troops, army intelligence, sneaking around, spying on people.
[00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:02.509]  That is pathetic, and it's illegal.
[00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:05.770]  But right now, let's just rampage through your calls.
[00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:10.812]  It's just... Let's go ahead and talk to Carl in Liberty Hill.
[00:29:10.852 --> 00:29:11.913]  That's basically Austin.
[00:29:12.874 --> 00:29:14.255]  And his comment is, U.S.
[00:29:14.415 --> 00:29:16.276]  opted out of the New World Order.
[00:29:16.436 --> 00:29:17.216]  No, the U.S.
[00:29:17.357 --> 00:29:19.258]  is the heart of the New World Order.
[00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:26.722]  We're being used by the Parasite Global Crime Syndicate to basically play the part of the bad cop to carry out their operations.
[00:29:26.742 --> 00:29:28.643]  But let me see what Carl has to say.
[00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:29.803]  Maybe I'm misunderstanding.
[00:29:30.103 --> 00:29:31.064]  Carl, welcome, sir.
[00:29:31.264 --> 00:29:33.805]  Yeah, that's been misinterpreted, what I said to your screen caller.
[00:29:34.126 --> 00:29:35.266]  God bless you, by the way, Alex.
[00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:36.307]  I think you're doing great work.
[00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:40.469]  I do think we should oppose or quote-unquote fight the New World Order.
[00:29:41.075 --> 00:29:41.696]  We're good to go.
[00:29:53.359 --> 00:30:09.789]  Well, the big problem is the general public's been conditioned that there is no New World Order when the North American Union has been set up, the Asian Union is official and operating, the European Union is operating, and then even those that know it exists say, well, maybe that's good.
[00:30:10.169 --> 00:30:14.232]  No, folks, because they abolish your liberties and freedoms under these new models.
[00:30:14.452 --> 00:30:16.813]  Yeah, but people shouldn't be naive.
[00:30:16.893 --> 00:30:36.384]  I mean, this stuff is going forward, and anybody that thinks there's going to be some kind of grassroots revolution that's going to overthrow the United States government and the United States military, a few militia types running around, I don't even know how to describe that, but that was woefully gullible.
[00:30:36.684 --> 00:30:40.246]  Well, when I talk about a revolution, I'm a counter-revolutionary.
[00:30:40.286 --> 00:30:42.047]  The people that have hijacked our government,
[00:30:42.446 --> 00:30:43.108]  We're good to go.
[00:30:43.148 --> 00:30:43.729]  We're good to go.
[00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:52.789]  They literally control the central banks that print the money across the planet.
[00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.150]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:54.271 --> 00:31:00.595]  And it's going to take an information war to educate the people about who the real elite are to then remove them.
[00:31:00.675 --> 00:31:02.617]  And it is possible to do that.
[00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:04.718]  They want to make it a violent revolution.
[00:31:04.939 --> 00:31:07.460]  That's why they provoke a tour and stage terror events.
[00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:11.403]  Well, that's why what you're doing is so important, because at least people can wake up.
[00:31:11.624 --> 00:31:15.667]  I mean, but it's... I don't know how to say this.
[00:31:15.827 --> 00:31:17.448]  It's much greater than anything that
[00:31:17.816 --> 00:31:19.356]  Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[00:31:19.596 --> 00:31:20.817]  I think that's a good point.
[00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:21.797]  I think that's a good point.
[00:31:44.258 --> 00:31:48.020]  Even if this was blown out of the water, they'd throw a few sacrificial lambs into the fire.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:58.966]  But none of the people like that you dealt with up in Canada, when you were up in Canada, you know, the people you ran across, and none of these people, the elite in Europe or here, no one... You're talking about when I went to the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:59.086 --> 00:32:11.353]  Well, you know, it will be hard to ever bring the actual David Rockefeller, Prince Bernhard, now Queen Beatrix, Queen Elizabeth, you know, the real controllers, Lord Rothschild...
[00:32:12.572 --> 00:32:16.399]  It will be hard to ever bring them to justice, but we can bring down this system.
[00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:17.221]  We can defeat it.
[00:32:17.701 --> 00:32:21.428]  Or we can have the NAFTA highway that will grab 8,000 miles of Texas roads.
[00:32:22.089 --> 00:32:24.193]  We can let them give us a one-child policy.
[00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:26.967]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:27.307]  Good, sir.
[00:32:27.327 --> 00:32:27.788]  Thanks for calling.
[00:32:27.808 --> 00:32:28.428]  What's on your mind?
[00:32:28.548 --> 00:32:33.030]  Well, what do you think of the idea of a 9-11 Truth March, a Million Man March, on Washington, D.C.? ?
[00:32:56.713 --> 00:32:59.537]  2007, July 4th.
[00:33:00.077 --> 00:33:01.359]  How do you feel about this idea?
[00:33:02.941 --> 00:33:09.931]  Well, I mean, I just conducted a march in New York on September 11th with about 2,000 people.
[00:33:11.423 --> 00:33:12.604]  I think we're good to go.
[00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:46.662]  I think a million-person march on Washington is fine to illustrate and expose it, but I promoted that march in New York for about four months, and we got about 2,000 people there, which is a lot of people, but it's not a million.
[00:33:48.812 --> 00:33:51.093]  We saw millions of illegal aliens.
[00:33:51.314 --> 00:33:56.216]  The mainstream media estimated it was about 3 million that marched over the two months of marching.
[00:33:56.276 --> 00:33:58.358]  Remember back earlier this year?
[00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:01.580]  What month was that?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.382]  Was it in April that all that marching was going on?
[00:34:06.202 --> 00:34:07.303]  And it went for about two months?
[00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:14.327]  That was in the Dallas Morning News back on Christmas Day that Rob Allen and co.
[00:34:14.367 --> 00:34:17.129]  had been hired by Vicente Fox and George Bush
[00:34:17.754 --> 00:34:20.236]  To go out and set up those demonstrations.
[00:34:20.597 --> 00:34:22.138]  They made deals with the media.
[00:34:22.178 --> 00:34:24.320]  There's evidence that a lot of money was paid.
[00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:31.487]  And so you saw thousands of news articles, hundreds of newscasts, dozens of national news stories hyping it.
[00:34:31.827 --> 00:34:37.613]  When liberals march and demonstrate, the media demonizes it and focuses in on green-haired kooks.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:45.444]  When the conservatives march against something, the media demonizes it and focuses in on some racist.
[00:34:45.905 --> 00:34:46.805]  Okay, I've been there.
[00:34:46.865 --> 00:34:47.326]  I've seen it.
[00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:48.626]  I've been there burning a U.N.
[00:34:48.666 --> 00:35:01.014]  flag in front of the state capitol, and the local news, what was it, NBC years ago, in fact, I did a TV show on this, showed some other guy burning an American flag from some file footage and put it over me.
[00:35:01.414 --> 00:35:03.275]  Okay, that's how these people operate.
[00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:05.196]  They're playing hardball, folks.
[00:35:05.857 --> 00:35:06.157]  All right?
[00:35:06.937 --> 00:35:09.178]  So yes, if we literally have... I'm serious.
[00:35:09.278 --> 00:35:10.598]  Thousands of news articles.
[00:35:10.738 --> 00:35:13.039]  Every newspaper in the country ran multiple stories.
[00:35:13.399 --> 00:35:14.319]  How good it was.
[00:35:14.399 --> 00:35:15.260]  How sweet it was.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.160]  How wonderful the illegals were.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.962]  Because the government's working with Mexico to break down our borders for a North American union.
[00:35:22.362 --> 00:35:24.542]  I have the official legislation here in front of me today.
[00:35:24.562 --> 00:35:26.203]  In fact, I'm going to cover some of it later.
[00:35:27.111 --> 00:35:35.175]  And so they want to capture the 30 million illegals in this country to use them as an engine to bully the citizens of this country, whether they're Hispanic, black, white, I don't care.
[00:35:35.856 --> 00:35:41.438]  It's about driving down wages, breaking down society, a tower of Babel, divided house, cannot stand.
[00:35:41.759 --> 00:35:42.539]  That's what's happening.
[00:35:42.799 --> 00:35:48.626]  And so they had Rob Allen and co., the guys that ran Bush's campaign and Fox's campaign, stage that.
[00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:51.349]  Now, you tell the average Republican that, they can't believe it.
[00:35:51.629 --> 00:35:54.473]  A lot of them actually go look up the article, and they're shocked.
[00:35:54.793 --> 00:35:56.255]  That's actually waking people up.
[00:35:56.555 --> 00:36:01.601]  Yeah, those demonstrations were run by the White House and by Vicente Fox out of Mexico.
[00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:02.462]  And why do I bring that up?
[00:36:03.917 --> 00:36:04.417]  We're good to go.
[00:36:04.437 --> 00:36:04.678]  I think?
[00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:35.786]  What I'm trying to get at is this.
[00:36:36.547 --> 00:36:39.209]  When you see 3 million people marching, that's staged.
[00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.592]  That's promoted, that's pushed, that's canned.
[00:36:42.852 --> 00:36:46.295]  You see 2,000, and you don't hear about it in the media, it shows the control.
[00:36:46.795 --> 00:36:48.356]  And why the mainstream press is bankrupt.
[00:36:48.697 --> 00:36:50.498]  We'll be right back with more of your calls and more news.
[00:36:50.518 --> 00:36:50.858]  Stay with us.
[00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:06.955]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:37:07.195 --> 00:37:08.956]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:37:09.216 --> 00:37:15.498]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:37:15.779 --> 00:37:21.921]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:37:22.161 --> 00:37:28.184]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:37:28.464 --> 00:37:34.889]  With no side effects, the 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:37:35.029 --> 00:37:38.572]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:37:38.872 --> 00:37:42.575]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:37:42.755 --> 00:37:45.297]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:37:45.437 --> 00:37:47.799]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:37:47.959 --> 00:37:50.421]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free 1-866-885-6625.
[00:37:50.621 --> 00:37:50.842]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[00:37:50.862 --> 00:37:50.922]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:37:57.887 --> 00:37:58.568]  We're good to go.
[00:38:22.128 --> 00:38:33.618]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:35.980]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:39.864]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:38:40.524 --> 00:38:46.930]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:38:47.751 --> 00:38:48.972]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:39:01.227 --> 00:39:05.309]  We've all seen the tornado device on TV and wondered if it really worked.
[00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:10.112]  I was also skeptical at first until we tested six tornado units.
[00:39:10.372 --> 00:39:14.955]  And in every case, we got more miles per gallon and felt more power.
[00:39:15.255 --> 00:39:20.658]  Gasoline's expensive, so when we find something that saves us money, it just makes sense to get it.
[00:39:20.918 --> 00:39:26.041]  Call 800-500-8880 and order your tornado unit today.
[00:39:26.241 --> 00:39:27.501]  Or visit tornadoair.com.
[00:39:30.536 --> 00:39:31.577]  Oil is oil.
[00:39:32.117 --> 00:39:33.178]  Don't kid yourself.
[00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:36.480]  Technology makes better oils possible, like Royal Purple.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.842]  Royal Purple reduces friction and increases film strength.
[00:39:40.123 --> 00:39:46.167]  Go to royalpurple.com and you'll find independent test results from North Carolina and Oklahoma State.
[00:39:46.327 --> 00:39:47.908]  Not height, just facts.

[00:39:49.089 --> 00:39:53.772]  Superior protection, fewer oil changes, more horsepower, torque, and better gas mileage.

[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.101]  I know it's not fair, but...
[00:41:42.871 --> 00:41:47.273]  Again, most talk shows, liberal and conservative, try to have people on that they just agree with.
[00:41:47.294 --> 00:41:49.875]  They try to censor out and screen calls.
[00:41:50.535 --> 00:41:52.376]  And I just don't like that type of talk radio.
[00:41:52.897 --> 00:41:54.017]  I can defend my ideas.
[00:41:55.198 --> 00:41:56.138]  Hit me with your best shot, 877-590-5525.
[00:41:56.158 --> 00:41:56.358]  Locally, 836-0590.
[00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:05.010]  All right, let me go over some more of the news.
[00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.372]  Now, understand, not only does H.R.
[00:42:07.572 --> 00:42:11.534]  6166, the Military Commissions Act, openly affect U.S.
[00:42:11.574 --> 00:42:14.896]  citizens and say that if you don't have total allegiance to the U.S.
[00:42:14.936 --> 00:42:18.258]  government, you can be secretly arrested and secretly executed, okay?
[00:42:18.658 --> 00:42:19.578]  That's what's in there.
[00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:31.205]  Go read it for yourself, 81-page bill, and there's a whole string of every top legal constitutional scholar, analyst from Georgetown and Yale and Princeton and...
[00:42:31.625 --> 00:42:32.025]  We're good to go.
[00:43:02.009 --> 00:43:03.990]  So, I know what I'm talking about here.
[00:43:04.951 --> 00:43:15.137]  But the mere fact that they don't just give themselves these powers, then people go read the bill they've passed, and they say, oh no, it won't affect you, don't try to repeal it, don't speak out, don't get angry, just let us have the powers.
[00:43:15.538 --> 00:43:29.086]  And then we go find all these federal court rulings where they went and argued, in Jose Padilla's case, or in the case of Mr. Walker, the American Taliban, where they argued that, oh, they're an enemy combatant, they've lost their citizenship.
[00:43:29.887 --> 00:43:31.989]  You see, Jose Padilla grabbed in Chicago.
[00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:33.790]  This is what they do.
[00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:34.651]  This is in the memos.
[00:43:34.691 --> 00:43:35.532]  This is in the bill.
[00:43:36.132 --> 00:43:36.873]  They lied.
[00:43:36.973 --> 00:43:40.076]  But what they say is, yeah, we don't arrest citizens.
[00:43:40.496 --> 00:43:42.658]  We just strip you of your citizenship so you're not a citizen.
[00:43:42.678 --> 00:43:46.741]  So it's like Bill Clinton saying, it depends on what the definition of is, is, is.
[00:43:47.382 --> 00:43:48.763]  So see, they're also lying about it.
[00:43:49.063 --> 00:43:50.364]  Now here's where it really gets scary.
[00:43:50.685 --> 00:43:52.286]  This is from NBC News.
[00:43:52.366 --> 00:43:57.390]  I also have the Agency France Press translated the French newswire.
[00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.871]  It's like AP.
[00:43:58.755 --> 00:44:00.797]  And several other reports are all saying the same thing.
[00:44:01.077 --> 00:44:03.078]  Pentagon admits keeping databases on U.S.
[00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:10.204]  civilians deemed suspicious, and it says they've infiltrated anti-war meetings of mainstream anti-war groups.
[00:44:10.584 --> 00:44:17.630]  They have covered any anti-war protests, including any protests of Halliburton or other subsidiary defense contractors.
[00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:18.931]  We're good to go.
[00:44:39.921 --> 00:44:40.442]  We're good to go.
[00:44:51.232 --> 00:44:57.196]  And they go, you better come by here and sign up or I'll have you arrested under code 794.
[00:44:57.456 --> 00:44:58.577]  It's always just made up.
[00:44:58.837 --> 00:44:59.858]  And the kid goes, really?
[00:45:00.058 --> 00:45:00.298]  Really?
[00:45:00.318 --> 00:45:00.939]  Yeah.
[00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:03.600]  In fact, we could pull this up on the computer right now and play it.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:04.741]  There's been so many newscasts.
[00:45:04.761 --> 00:45:10.505]  I mean, like, type into Google, Trey, something like, recruiter threatens child to sign papers or something like that.
[00:45:10.965 --> 00:45:13.447]  And the child goes, all right, I'll come on in and sign it.
[00:45:13.647 --> 00:45:14.667]  That's right, you better.
[00:45:14.687 --> 00:45:16.348]  Now don't tell your parents about this.
[00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:17.949]  And then they get promoted.
[00:45:17.989 --> 00:45:19.510]  This is illegal activity.
[00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:27.055]  By the way, how many of you know that 20% of the troops on the ground in Baghdad are illegal aliens from Latin America that the government's hired?
[00:45:27.235 --> 00:45:33.739]  How many of you know the Washington Times reported that they're hiring not just illegal aliens, but aggravated felons from rape?
[00:45:34.279 --> 00:45:37.880]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, rape and arson and armed robbery.
[00:45:38.081 --> 00:45:42.022]  And I know there's media listening right now that doesn't know how to use Google, but you know how to use LexisNexis.
[00:45:42.562 --> 00:45:44.823]  You want to come down here and bet me hard coal cash?
[00:45:44.843 --> 00:45:48.184]  The Washington Times reported that they're hiring aggravated felons.
[00:45:48.665 --> 00:45:51.146]  So that's your land of the free, home of the slave.
[00:45:51.966 --> 00:45:53.106]  I love our military.
[00:45:53.346 --> 00:45:59.749]  I hate it being turned into nothing but the Crips and the Bloods slash Mexican Mafia recruiting ground.
[00:46:00.427 --> 00:46:02.332]  Because that's basically... Stalin did that?
[00:46:02.372 --> 00:46:02.994]  Hitler did that?
[00:46:03.154 --> 00:46:04.838]  Who do you think the SA was in the SS?
[00:46:05.959 --> 00:46:09.182]  Hitler opened the prisons up before he even came to power.
[00:46:09.322 --> 00:46:23.292]  When they got regional governors in around Germany, before he became the Fuhrer, before he blew up the Reichstag, before he staged terror attacks to become the great leader, and staged terror attacks to launch World War II, to start the war with Poland.
[00:46:23.332 --> 00:46:24.033]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:46:24.473 --> 00:46:26.655]  Oh yeah, our government takes a page out of his handbook.
[00:46:27.115 --> 00:46:31.539]  Before he did that, they went and opened up the jails and used that as their army.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:32.820]  So...
[00:46:34.005 --> 00:46:35.629]  You want to take people's liberties and freedoms?
[00:46:35.669 --> 00:46:36.772]  You hire criminals.
[00:46:37.172 --> 00:46:37.734]  So here it is.
[00:46:37.794 --> 00:46:38.776]  It's totally illegal.
[00:46:39.017 --> 00:46:43.026]  It violates a whole slew of federal laws, and that's in these articles right here.
[00:46:43.977 --> 00:46:55.460]  The defense spokesman, who would not be identified by name, would not say whether reports of activists and anti-war activists were in the database, which is known as the Threat and Local Observation Notice, or TALEN, reporting system.
[00:46:56.241 --> 00:46:58.981]  Next, I have the Associated Press here.
[00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:01.762]  Government targeting American bloggers as enemy combatants.
[00:47:02.122 --> 00:47:03.443]  Military homeland security.
[00:47:03.743 --> 00:47:04.903]  Bush White House strategy.
[00:47:04.943 --> 00:47:08.844]  Sharpen knives against anyone who are critical of their war on terror.
[00:47:08.864 --> 00:47:11.285]  That's one of our headlines from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:12.609 --> 00:47:17.594]  And we have AP, we have CENTCOM's own website, we have the Raw Story reporting on this.
[00:47:18.675 --> 00:47:29.166]  And when you read this, he gave a speech last Monday in California saying that the Internet is an enemy recruiting ground and they need to censor it and control it.
[00:47:30.567 --> 00:47:34.030]  By the way, on top of that, I have the press release from CENTCOM.
[00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:36.493]  I mean, this is directly from CENTCOM.
[00:47:37.176 --> 00:47:40.519]  And Raw Story obtained the actual CENTCOM email to bloggers.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.041]  And listen to this.
[00:47:42.081 --> 00:47:46.405]  CENTCOM announced earlier this year that a team of employees would be engaging.
[00:47:46.425 --> 00:47:47.085]  That's their word.
[00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:49.127]  Oh, the military engaging America.
[00:47:49.147 --> 00:47:50.449]  Oh, that's freedom.
[00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:58.096]  Bloggers who are posting inaccurate or untrue information, in their words, as well as bloggers who are posting incomplete information.
[00:47:58.556 --> 00:48:00.278]  The email was addressed to Raw Story.
[00:48:01.248 --> 00:48:02.349]  It was not addressed to a raw story.
[00:48:02.389 --> 00:48:07.711]  It says the main interest is to be a driver for their readers to our site.
[00:48:08.172 --> 00:48:14.655]  He goes on to say that bloggers' information goes viral and that SimpCom can counter this by going viral themselves.
[00:48:15.135 --> 00:48:22.619]  It's illegal to have the military posing as citizens, posing as someone else engaging in domestic propaganda.
[00:48:22.959 --> 00:48:28.262]  It's illegal for the military to be engaging in domestic propaganda, period, for domestic consumption.
[00:48:29.605 --> 00:48:36.089]  And, again, I was on Lars Larson's national radio show this week, and he point-blank called me a liar.
[00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:56.123]  I said, George Bush, illegally, according to the General Accounting Office and the Governmental Accounting Office, two separate congressional non-partisan groups, bought $1.6 billion in fake news in the last two years, paid off thousands of reporters, hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece, and that was the average, in some cases more, in some cases less,
[00:48:57.690 --> 00:49:05.075]  Tommy Franks, after he got out, was paid $450-something a year for two years to pose as if he was nonpartisan.
[00:49:05.256 --> 00:49:08.298]  He'd always lead with, I'm not a Republican or a Democrat.
[00:49:08.338 --> 00:49:11.981]  Then he'd lay his, I think we ought to have martial law after the next attack.
[00:49:12.221 --> 00:49:13.262]  It's real sad, but...
[00:49:14.423 --> 00:49:16.223]  I'm saying this because I'm non-partisan.
[00:49:16.444 --> 00:49:17.924]  Turned out he was on the payroll.
[00:49:18.364 --> 00:49:20.886]  Armstrong Williams, 200 and something thousand.
[00:49:20.906 --> 00:49:21.366]  Was it 244,000?
[00:49:21.586 --> 00:49:27.649]  To go around lying and saying he was independently for No Child Left Behind, which federalizes education.
[00:49:27.929 --> 00:49:28.510]  It's horrible.
[00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:34.132]  This is the type of stuff that we're dealing with on a day-to-day basis.
[00:49:34.353 --> 00:49:36.174]  And this national host just said, it's not true.
[00:49:36.534 --> 00:49:37.234]  No, it's not true.
[00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:39.135]  And I said, just type it into Google.
[00:49:39.155 --> 00:49:40.876]  He goes, oh, Google's always right.
[00:49:41.416 --> 00:49:42.997]  And I said, Lars, you're not stupid.
[00:49:43.832 --> 00:49:44.432]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:50:08.564 --> 00:50:08.824]  Hello.
[00:50:09.264 --> 00:50:14.426]  I was just wondering, you know, I heard the interview with Jesse Ventura, and he moved out to Mexico.
[00:50:14.486 --> 00:50:21.129]  I'm seeing more and more of the people that are connected or in the know that actually know something about what's going on in the government.
[00:50:21.569 --> 00:50:22.949]  They're getting out of the country.
[00:50:23.049 --> 00:50:23.409]  That's right.
[00:50:23.449 --> 00:50:26.751]  He told AP when he left it's because, quote, we're now a fascist dictatorship.
[00:50:27.311 --> 00:50:27.571]  Yeah.
[00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:33.133]  Now, I noticed that George W. Bush, according to some reports I've been seeing, that he just purchased a 98,842-acre farm.
[00:50:38.047 --> 00:50:38.989]  Yes, they did.
[00:50:39.089 --> 00:50:41.392]  And then it turned out they used the Moonies as a front.
[00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:48.081]  And a lot of people think it's because he may have to escape because of war crimes charges.
[00:50:48.782 --> 00:50:51.205]  The Bushes are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:52.435]  We're good to go.
[00:50:52.455 --> 00:50:52.695]  I think?
[00:51:20.206 --> 00:51:20.947]  They own banks.
[00:51:20.967 --> 00:51:22.648]  They own prison industries.
[00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:26.772]  They are so wealthy.
[00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:29.254]  But again, real mafia wealth is secret.
[00:51:29.434 --> 00:51:32.516]  It's like the Queen of the Netherlands owns Dutch Rochelle.
[00:51:33.077 --> 00:51:36.580]  It's worth trillions, according to top analysts, but her wealth is secret.
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.041]  She's not in the Forbes top 500.
[00:51:39.002 --> 00:51:40.003]  But thank you for the call, sir.
[00:51:40.043 --> 00:51:40.903]  Really appreciate it.
[00:51:41.504 --> 00:51:42.044]  Many others.
[00:51:42.124 --> 00:51:42.985]  Second hour is coming up.
[00:51:43.045 --> 00:51:43.586]  Tons of news.
[00:51:43.626 --> 00:51:44.426]  Everybody stay there.
[00:51:44.646 --> 00:51:45.227]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:50.834 --> 00:51:52.055]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[00:52:21.897 --> 00:52:24.377]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:52:24.858 --> 00:52:26.758]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:30.639]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:52:31.299 --> 00:52:37.760]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.740]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:52:41.121 --> 00:52:41.561]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:41.641 --> 00:52:43.041]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:50.575 --> 00:52:50.735]  Hello.
[00:52:50.835 --> 00:52:51.136]  Hello.
[00:53:06.963 --> 00:53:10.125]  Yes, my friends, we are now into the
[00:53:36.696 --> 00:53:39.437]  Second hour of this worldwide broadcast here in Austin, Texas.
[00:53:39.517 --> 00:53:40.798]  It's everything Rolling Stones.
[00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:54.105]  It is absolute worship of three little spindly, skinny old men with pot bellies flapping around, prancing around, waving their arms around, everyone kneeling before them, worshipping them.
[00:53:54.665 --> 00:53:57.967]  But hell, we worship George Bush, a sputtering, stuttering...
[00:53:58.928 --> 00:54:02.351]  Low-grade morons, so why not love the Rolling Stones?
[00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:05.313]  I say, all right, look, I'm irreverent.
[00:54:05.353 --> 00:54:05.873]  I'm sorry.
[00:54:05.913 --> 00:54:07.174]  I'm not trying to be shocking.
[00:54:07.495 --> 00:54:09.216]  I like a few Rolling Stones songs.
[00:54:09.656 --> 00:54:13.499]  But, I mean, they don't hold a candle to Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd or any of it.
[00:54:13.539 --> 00:54:19.023]  And just to hear the ultimate rock band on planet Earth is entering Austin, Texas.
[00:54:19.444 --> 00:54:21.345]  Everyone, start worshiping them.
[00:54:21.705 --> 00:54:23.247]  Name your children after them.
[00:54:23.887 --> 00:54:24.367]  And I'm sorry.
[00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:24.988]  I'm sorry.
[00:54:26.244 --> 00:54:26.644]  Oh, yeah.
[00:54:26.704 --> 00:54:27.305]  Crank it up.
[00:54:27.405 --> 00:54:28.125]  Yeah, here we go.
[00:54:28.306 --> 00:54:29.246]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:54:30.107 --> 00:54:30.927]  I just can't help it.
[00:54:31.168 --> 00:54:31.528]  No, no, no.
[00:54:31.548 --> 00:54:31.948]  Seriously.
[00:54:31.968 --> 00:54:33.529]  Let me get serious here.
[00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:36.291]  I like Vince Young when he was at UT.
[00:54:36.371 --> 00:54:37.532]  I even like UT football.
[00:54:37.572 --> 00:54:46.859]  But when something becomes religious, when something gets hyped to the 10 millionth degree, I just automatically turn away from it.
[00:54:46.939 --> 00:54:52.623]  I mean, people who call into this show telling me how great I am during the week with my weekday show, you hear me just go, please stop.
[00:54:53.003 --> 00:54:54.485]  Because there's just something...
[00:54:56.454 --> 00:54:57.354]  Distasteful?
[00:54:57.454 --> 00:55:05.976]  I mean, with me personally, it's a pet peeve that... I mean, this Rolling Stone thing got hyped so much that I'm not going to listen to it.
[00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:09.377]  I'm not going down there just because of the way it got hyped.
[00:55:09.817 --> 00:55:11.177]  Plus, it turns into a big nightmare.
[00:55:12.357 --> 00:55:14.838]  But I guess that's how hype works.
[00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.698]  You know what I'm upset about?
[00:55:16.758 --> 00:55:18.259]  You know what I think is really important?
[00:55:18.939 --> 00:55:24.100]  It's the fact that the first ten amendments to the Bill of Rights have been completely...
[00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:28.254]  And totally dismantled, totally eviscerated.
[00:55:28.274 --> 00:55:32.659]  And that's not Alex Jones putting some hyperbole or hyping something.
[00:55:33.604 --> 00:55:36.786]  That's what all the constitutional scholars are saying.
[00:55:36.806 --> 00:55:39.007]  That's what real conservatives are saying.
[00:55:39.307 --> 00:55:41.588]  And I consider myself to be a paleo-conservative.
[00:55:41.868 --> 00:55:43.669]  Please don't compare me to what we see today.
[00:55:44.269 --> 00:55:58.856]  And then they have the nerve to lie and say that Patriot Act doesn't affect citizens and is non-terror related, and that this new Military Commissions Act doesn't affect citizens when it clearly says it in the bill.
[00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.575]  That upsets me, and that makes me angry.
[00:56:02.675 --> 00:56:04.339]  Aren't you tired of being lied to?
[00:56:04.599 --> 00:56:09.488]  Did you know that four weeks ago in Canada, it was all over the Canadian press, only in a few U.S.
[00:56:09.528 --> 00:56:10.190]  newspapers here,
[00:56:10.894 --> 00:56:20.443]  Did you know that they had the official North American Union government meeting with the three branches of Canada, Mexico, and the United States?
[00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:27.830]  All three governments, their meeting, officially writing up the operating system of the new North American Union.
[00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:34.677]  Did you know that two weeks ago, and it was in Reuters, it was in the Korean Times, it was in the Tokyo newspaper, but not in our paper.
[00:56:35.157 --> 00:56:35.977]  Not in our papers.
[00:56:36.477 --> 00:56:38.418]  The Asian Union is now official.
[00:56:38.778 --> 00:56:40.778]  And you go, well, again, that's just the future.
[00:56:40.818 --> 00:56:41.519]  That's the next step.
[00:56:41.539 --> 00:56:42.319]  That's the next wave.
[00:56:42.819 --> 00:56:43.879]  No, it isn't.
[00:56:44.279 --> 00:56:52.521]  They want to abolish national sovereignty because there's liberty and freedoms codified in our Declaration of Independence, in our Bill of Rights, in our Constitution.
[00:56:52.901 --> 00:56:57.442]  There's even some rights codified in the Canadian Constitution or the Mexican Constitution.
[00:56:57.862 --> 00:57:02.383]  Under this new system, take the World Bank, the IMF.
[00:57:02.403 --> 00:57:03.084]  They're not governmental.
[00:57:03.104 --> 00:57:03.564]  They're private.
[00:57:03.944 --> 00:57:04.504]  Take the
[00:57:05.439 --> 00:57:12.762]  World Trade Organization with more control over our trade than our Congress because they gave away their authority, what, nine years ago.
[00:57:13.522 --> 00:57:15.003]  That is a private group.
[00:57:15.123 --> 00:57:20.685]  They work at the behest of private global corporations, and this is where mainline conservatives go wrong.
[00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:24.953]  These so-called global corporations are not free market.
[00:57:25.033 --> 00:57:28.676]  They have their own militaries, their own security, their own intelligence.
[00:57:28.696 --> 00:57:30.037]  They pay off politicians.
[00:57:30.337 --> 00:57:33.740]  They get the lion's share of corporate welfare that you and I pay.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.562]  Look, you're mad about some woman with five kids on welfare?
[00:57:36.602 --> 00:57:37.143]  So am I!
[00:57:37.757 --> 00:57:41.700]  But you better understand that is a small percentage of corporate welfare.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:44.962]  But oh, corporate welfare is okay because you think that's conservative.
[00:57:45.262 --> 00:57:46.443]  It is not conservative.
[00:57:46.784 --> 00:57:55.470]  And the very same corporate welfare you're paying for, I'd be a little more for it, but I'm really a libertarian so I wouldn't be, but I could handle it a little bit better if we still have jobs here.
[00:57:55.670 --> 00:58:01.134]  If these corporations that got corporate welfare from our government had some type of allegiance to this country.
[00:58:02.563 --> 00:58:04.284]  And look, I'm going all over the map here.
[00:58:04.324 --> 00:58:05.504]  It's because I'm frustrated.
[00:58:05.564 --> 00:58:07.065]  There's too many facets.
[00:58:07.105 --> 00:58:13.047]  There's too many things happening to ever properly cover it all, unless I guess I did one subject per broadcast.
[00:58:13.067 --> 00:58:14.387]  And sometimes I think I should do that.
[00:58:14.667 --> 00:58:16.188]  I do that on my three-hour daily show.
[00:58:16.248 --> 00:58:18.889]  I need to get three hours here out of the KLBJ studios.
[00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:19.869]  We'll try to do that soon.
[00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:26.932]  And with the syndicated broadcast we're now doing here, because I need to do an hour where I just settle down and cover one issue.
[00:58:26.952 --> 00:58:28.152]  That's what I do on the syndicated show.
[00:58:28.172 --> 00:58:29.413]  Well, this is syndicated now, too, so...
[00:58:30.255 --> 00:58:34.697]  I keep thinking of the five, six weeks before, while we were developing the show, that it wasn't syndicated.
[00:58:35.717 --> 00:58:37.118]  Let me just go through some of the other news.
[00:58:37.158 --> 00:58:44.881]  I mean, just here at the KLBJ Studios in Austin, Texas, during the breaks, I've seen about ten things I want to talk about.
[00:58:44.901 --> 00:58:46.882]  In fact, where is that?
[00:58:46.942 --> 00:58:49.583]  I have that report here in front of me.
[00:58:49.643 --> 00:58:50.223]  Oh, here it is.
[00:58:50.303 --> 00:58:54.305]  This is in today's business and personal finance section.
[00:58:55.689 --> 00:59:01.092]  Carbon credits market seen as ripe for abuse.
[00:59:02.253 --> 00:59:03.933]  And this is an AP article in the Statesman.
[00:59:03.993 --> 00:59:08.616]  System for combating greenhouse gas emissions has forsaken principles, critics say.
[00:59:10.017 --> 00:59:11.277]  This is a very complex issue.
[00:59:11.337 --> 00:59:12.458]  I could talk for an hour about it.
[00:59:12.718 --> 00:59:13.618]  But I want to go to your calls.
[00:59:14.359 --> 00:59:16.460]  And I've got all these other issues to talk about.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.001]  New 9-11 information I want to cover.
[00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:21.042]  I want to read Pat Tillman's brother's letter.
[00:59:21.743 --> 00:59:22.703]  It's poignant.
[00:59:22.723 --> 00:59:23.224]  It's painful.
[00:59:23.244 --> 00:59:23.964]  It makes me want to cry.
[00:59:24.676 --> 00:59:31.139]  It's all coming up, but do you understand that, number one, global warming isn't real?
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:35.402]  Yes, global warming isn't real.
[00:59:35.982 --> 00:59:36.662]  Ah, wait, wait, wait!
[00:59:37.002 --> 00:59:41.044]  Climate change, violent climate change is real.
[00:59:42.085 --> 00:59:45.907]  But they simplify it down for you, and they call it global warming.
[00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:48.870]  And why did they do that?
[00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.151]  Who created the theory of peak oil?
[00:59:51.191 --> 00:59:52.071]  We're running out of oil.
[00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:57.652]  Now, we have the actual documents where they hired a PR firm 11 years ago to create it.
[00:59:57.692 --> 00:59:59.232]  Was it some liberal environmental group?
[00:59:59.272 --> 01:00:00.853]  No, it was Dutch Royal Shell.
[01:00:01.193 --> 01:00:02.033]  Queen Beatrix again.
[01:00:02.173 --> 01:00:02.733]  It's always her.
[01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:05.113]  Every time she pops up like the devil or something.
[01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:06.134]  It's like Rumsfeld.
[01:00:06.154 --> 01:00:12.755]  Every time I find some new evil report or some arming of some dictator with nukes or botulism or anthrax, it's always Rumsfeld.
[01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.315]  You know, Iraq, North Korea, everybody.
[01:00:14.655 --> 01:00:16.836]  It's the same thing with Queen Beatrix and Dutch Royal Shell.
[01:00:16.856 --> 01:00:17.616]  They're involved in everything.
[01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:28.103]  And they finance the phony environmental movements which are there to devalue property rights, there to get the general public to buy into taking people's farms, their ranches.
[01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:31.086]  Here in Austin, Save Our Springs, co-opted a bunch of hippies.
[01:00:31.346 --> 01:00:34.169]  They took 15,000 plus acres and stopped with Travis County.
[01:00:34.469 --> 01:00:35.510]  Everybody forgot about it.
[01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:38.653]  They took the building restrictions off and sold it to select corporations.
[01:00:38.974 --> 01:00:42.577]  It's the same thing with global warming.
[01:00:43.627 --> 01:00:46.189]  Even if you believe in global warming, let's not argue that.
[01:00:46.669 --> 01:00:52.472]  Their solution has nothing to do with global warming.
[01:00:52.853 --> 01:00:56.815]  Their solution is a global tax, but they won't even call it that.
[01:00:56.855 --> 01:00:57.876]  They call it a credit.
[01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:02.979]  If you use too much fuel, if you use too much energy, you've got to pay a tax.
[01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:06.401]  But then if you cut back, they even give you a credit.
[01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:14.062]  Now, that's just a mumbo-jumbo way of saying global tax, and it's only on Europe, the U.S., and Canada.
[01:01:14.502 --> 01:01:16.384]  It is not on China.
[01:01:16.424 --> 01:01:19.385]  It is not on India and 167 other countries.
[01:01:19.606 --> 01:01:32.854]  And finally, I almost fell over out there in the, I don't know what you call that, kind of the communal area out there in the hive here at the KLBJ Labyrinthine Parential Studios.
[01:01:32.954 --> 01:01:34.735]  Parential is not even a word.
[01:01:34.835 --> 01:01:35.375]  Palatial.
[01:01:35.675 --> 01:01:36.456]  I'm losing my mind.
[01:01:37.252 --> 01:01:41.297]  Carbon credits market seen as right for abuse.
[01:01:41.677 --> 01:01:45.862]  System for combating greenhouse gas emissions has forsaken principles.
[01:01:46.042 --> 01:01:49.726]  See, that's always the well-meaning people who help push this don't understand.
[01:01:50.026 --> 01:01:51.287]  It's always about attacks.
[01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.749]  It's always about control.
[01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:55.652]  It's the big polluters that are pushing all of this.
[01:01:55.872 --> 01:01:57.534]  No, you can't figure that out.
[01:01:57.794 --> 01:01:58.694]  You can't understand.
[01:01:58.894 --> 01:02:12.198]  Just open up a major magazine, something like National Geographic, which the whole thing is anti-human, anti-development, anti-freedom, and every other advertisement is Dutch Royal Shell or Exxon Mobil.
[01:02:13.618 --> 01:02:16.399]  They're pushing this neo-feudalist agenda.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:26.262]  And it goes on to say that as the world grows warmer, poorer nations are helping the rich by reining in heat-trapping gases in a multi-billion dollar carbon trade.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.481]  But it turns out that's not really the case.
[01:02:28.761 --> 01:02:30.242]  It's a global tax.
[01:02:30.563 --> 01:02:38.308]  It has nothing... A volcano spews more emissions than all the cars and all the factories in the last hundred years.
[01:02:38.328 --> 01:02:39.249]  That's official numbers.
[01:02:40.249 --> 01:02:46.754]  Again, they create some false threat, get you to jump on board, where it has nothing to do with climate change.
[01:02:46.974 --> 01:02:49.616]  I'll tell you what's causing climate change when we get back.
[01:02:49.796 --> 01:02:50.517]  Then we'll go to your calls.
[01:02:50.537 --> 01:02:51.878]  We're going to do a bunch of other issues.
[01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:52.338]  Stay with us.

[01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:53.096]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:03:53.136 --> 01:03:54.318]  Today is October 20th, 2006.
[01:03:54.358 --> 01:03:56.801]  Gold opened at $5.9640 and one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.2830.
[01:03:56.841 --> 01:03:58.904]  Again, that's $6.2830 to purchase one ounce gold coins.
[01:04:04.784 --> 01:04:07.486]  Do you ever wonder why deficit spending never goes away?
[01:04:07.946 --> 01:04:12.569]  Would you believe me if I told you that fiscal responsibility would lead to a second Great Depression?
[01:04:12.969 --> 01:04:14.350]  Believe it or not, this is true.
[01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:17.972]  Our economy gets its currency from a private banking cartel.
[01:04:18.353 --> 01:04:23.816]  We, the people, labor to create the money, only to turn it over to this institution for its seal of approval.
[01:04:24.216 --> 01:04:29.860]  They, in turn, lend it back to us, and we, the people, are forced to labor to service the interest on this debt.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.181]  Minus Resources is offering The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve.

[01:07:20.476 --> 01:07:22.137]  They're making me laugh in the control room.
[01:07:23.077 --> 01:07:30.499]  For so many years, I've done the broadcast either out of a studio at my house or out of a studio at my office, which is a non-professional studio hooked into...
[01:07:31.577 --> 01:07:34.098]  The folks that run it out of Minnesota with the satellite uplinks.
[01:07:34.158 --> 01:07:35.919]  But here, look at the glass.
[01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.380]  Always communicating with people in the control room.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.080]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:45.522]  Okay, I'm going to go to Corey and Charlie and Steve and others here in just a moment.
[01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:46.282]  The number is 877-595-5525.
[01:07:46.303 --> 01:07:47.503]  Here locally in Central Texas, 836-0590.
[01:07:47.543 --> 01:07:49.784]  Or you can call toll-free on the wireless as well.
[01:07:59.364 --> 01:08:02.126]  In fact, where is that here on the sheet?
[01:08:02.146 --> 01:08:03.508]  I guess they changed it.
[01:08:04.588 --> 01:08:05.429]  All right, seriously.
[01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:12.555]  I was mentioning before the break that I was going to tell you what's really causing climate change.
[01:08:13.136 --> 01:08:16.458]  So I'm not arguing that there isn't climate change.
[01:08:17.319 --> 01:08:20.081]  But the fact is there's always climate change.
[01:08:20.141 --> 01:08:24.565]  We're on a 12,000-year cycle of going in and out of cooling systems,
[01:08:24.978 --> 01:08:27.579]  And the ice core samples show that.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:45.128]  And it's clear that volcanoes and asteroid impacts and other things of this nature generate many, many, many, many times the amount of carbons and greenhouse gases that supposedly heat our atmosphere because of interactions with the sun.
[01:08:45.748 --> 01:08:51.251]  So why then are they claiming that they need to have a global tax to combat this?
[01:08:51.824 --> 01:08:58.290]  Global warming, when global warming hasn't been proven, what's been proven is continual, ongoing climate change.
[01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:03.534]  What does NASA say, and other scientific bodies, what do they say about it?
[01:09:04.675 --> 01:09:09.459]  They say, and this is actually what most climatologists say, and most meteorologists say, that it's the sun.
[01:09:09.579 --> 01:09:18.907]  They thought that the last 11 and a half year cycle was the hottest ever recorded, that is the most radiation, different wavelengths, different rays being generated by the sun.
[01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:27.139]  Out past Mercury and then, of course, crossing Venus and hitting our planet, Third Rock, out from the sun.
[01:09:27.639 --> 01:09:28.660]  What is causing it?
[01:09:28.861 --> 01:09:29.522]  The sun.
[01:09:30.222 --> 01:09:34.427]  And the sun just ended its supposed 11.5-year cycle and is heating up even more.
[01:09:35.048 --> 01:09:37.190]  The sun, NASA's reporting, with current...
[01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:49.916]  If it continues to increase in this cycle, and this is what they're predicting, will, in the next six years, peaking in the next 12-year cycle, 11-and-a-half-year cycle, will double in its brightness.
[01:09:49.996 --> 01:09:51.957]  Something's going on with the sun.
[01:09:52.357 --> 01:09:56.479]  And I assure you, no amount of global taxes are going to fix that problem.
[01:09:57.839 --> 01:09:59.740]  There's a reason the earth gets hot and gets cold.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.981]  There's a reason we have flash ice ages.
[01:10:02.481 --> 01:10:06.083]  And by the way, they're saying the sun heating up may actually cause another ice age.
[01:10:06.793 --> 01:10:20.155]  You'd think it would heat things up, but see, if it heats things up, then it causes that much more precipitation that then falls on the ice caps, then expands them, then the ice caps reflect more light, and it can actually, despite the sun being brighter, cool things down even quicker.
[01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:23.016]  This is pretty complex stuff, and I don't claim to be one of the experts.
[01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:29.837]  I just read what the experts are saying, who aren't part of some paid-off group by the UN pushing a global tax.
[01:10:30.337 --> 01:10:32.158]  Let's go ahead and take calls.
[01:10:32.678 --> 01:10:33.918]  Let's talk to...
[01:10:35.111 --> 01:10:38.092]  Charlie in Dripping Springs and Corey in Southern California.
[01:10:38.572 --> 01:10:39.892]  Charlie, welcome to the airwaves.
[01:10:40.632 --> 01:10:41.293]  Hi, Alex.
[01:10:41.553 --> 01:10:41.973]  Hello, sir.
[01:10:43.533 --> 01:10:47.694]  I have two questions for you, one immediate and one I've always wanted to ask you.
[01:10:48.914 --> 01:10:59.737]  First of all, you've always said that taking back power starts at the city and the local and the county and the state election candidates.
[01:11:00.377 --> 01:11:04.018]  I was wondering, is there any kind of clearinghouse system
[01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:05.435]  There are.
[01:11:05.455 --> 01:11:07.357]  The John Birch Society does that at a federal level.
[01:11:07.377 --> 01:11:11.160]  There are lots of watchdog groups that do that at the state and local level.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:11.780]  But a lot of times...
[01:11:24.491 --> 01:11:26.552]  They have a dog in the fight, as they say.
[01:11:27.212 --> 01:11:30.234]  And so you can't really trust how the Democrats review candidates.
[01:11:30.254 --> 01:11:32.976]  You can't really trust how Republicans review candidates.
[01:11:33.176 --> 01:11:40.339]  Really, it's a good rule to actually find out the voting record or the stance of each candidate.
[01:11:40.419 --> 01:11:42.681]  It takes a lot of personal work.
[01:11:43.001 --> 01:11:47.223]  Actually, I've never been trustful of a conservative, of even a conservative.
[01:11:47.423 --> 01:11:48.504]  I'm a Republican.
[01:11:48.544 --> 01:11:49.004]  I've never been...
[01:11:49.611 --> 01:11:52.932]  I've never been real happy with those.
[01:11:53.452 --> 01:11:57.013]  I need to find out what these people actually did in their time.
[01:11:57.693 --> 01:11:58.653]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:11:58.713 --> 01:11:59.894]  It just takes a lot of work.
[01:11:59.954 --> 01:12:00.654]  I'll tell you this.
[01:12:01.294 --> 01:12:04.175]  I'm not voting for Rick Perry for governor.
[01:12:04.255 --> 01:12:06.176]  I'm not voting for Strayhorn.
[01:12:06.616 --> 01:12:13.057]  I mean, Friedman, who I've interviewed in studios, is kind of a clown, but at least he's not his establishment.
[01:12:13.277 --> 01:12:14.538]  I mean, I don't trust Strayhorn.
[01:12:14.858 --> 01:12:17.259]  Strayhorn is a big operative.
[01:12:17.439 --> 01:12:18.859]  She's fooled a lot of people.
[01:12:21.676 --> 01:12:23.197]  I would vote for Kiki Friedman, personally.
[01:12:24.618 --> 01:12:25.318]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:25.338 --> 01:12:31.943]  You know, I've always thought that the more votes you throw to an independent or a libertarian, the more it scares the big two.
[01:12:32.003 --> 01:12:41.490]  Well, we always said, you know, people always say, well, I like the third party, I like the libertarian, I like the constitutionalist, I like the green person, but I'm not going to vote for them because I'd be throwing it away.
[01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:44.352]  You're not going to build those parties unless you start doing that.
[01:12:44.972 --> 01:12:46.033]  Any other questions?
[01:12:46.493 --> 01:12:47.434]  I've always told people,
[01:12:47.893 --> 01:12:53.994]  Unless you vote an independent or libertarian, you're not going to scare the big two.
[01:12:54.074 --> 01:12:54.934]  You're just not going to do it.
[01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.095]  Well, I'll tell you this, too.
[01:12:56.455 --> 01:13:01.296]  We get 55-60% turnouts on big federal elections and 8% locally on average in this country.
[01:13:01.336 --> 01:13:02.196]  And that happens to be Austin.
[01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:04.656]  I think Austin's 8.6 in the last election.
[01:13:05.016 --> 01:13:07.297]  It needs to be 50% locally.
[01:13:07.597 --> 01:13:10.197]  It needs to be people... Because that's where the real power is.
[01:13:10.237 --> 01:13:13.358]  The media makes a big circus out of national and state elections.
[01:13:13.898 --> 01:13:15.420]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:15.580]  You bet.
[01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:48.385]  I wanted to get your comment on Steven Jones, but I also wanted to talk about the 9-11 hijackers.
[01:13:48.985 --> 01:13:49.185]  Sure.
[01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:54.267]  For those that didn't know, Professor Steven Jones of Brigham Young University took early retirement.
[01:13:54.667 --> 01:14:10.232]  He's a real scientist, and he, of course, has done a lot of work for the federal government disproving or proving other hypotheses, and he believes that 9-11 was an inside job from the evidence, and the neocons went after him, smeared him,
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.661]  Sure, what was your other point?
[01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:42.753]  And then I wanted to talk about the Malin hijackers because, I mean, I just have so many different questions about them.
[01:14:42.773 --> 01:14:43.814]  You know, who were they?
[01:14:44.094 --> 01:14:46.395]  I mean, were they really Al-Qaeda?
[01:14:46.435 --> 01:14:48.196]  Were they with one of the intelligence agencies?
[01:14:48.357 --> 01:14:50.778]  All we know is they were employees of the U.S.
[01:14:50.818 --> 01:14:51.178]  government.
[01:14:52.219 --> 01:14:54.941]  I mean, that is unquestionable, totally verified.
[01:14:55.581 --> 01:14:56.882]  Have you ever heard me speak to that?
[01:14:57.535 --> 01:15:00.556]  I mean, you have the FBI informants who live with them.
[01:15:00.737 --> 01:15:03.098]  Well, we have them trained at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[01:15:03.318 --> 01:15:04.938]  We have them trained at Defense Language School.
[01:15:04.999 --> 01:15:09.020]  The dean of the school, the colonel, went public and said, this is an inside job.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:09.821]  This was two months after 9-11.
[01:15:11.302 --> 01:15:12.082]  It was in the AP.
[01:15:12.122 --> 01:15:13.583]  It was in the San Jose Mercury News.
[01:15:13.603 --> 01:15:14.963]  And he said, I'm the dean.
[01:15:14.983 --> 01:15:16.504]  Three of these guys were trained at our base.
[01:15:16.804 --> 01:15:17.444]  These are U.S.
[01:15:17.484 --> 01:15:18.244]  government agents.
[01:15:18.704 --> 01:15:20.045]  Something's wrong here.
[01:15:20.365 --> 01:15:21.865]  And then we have two different U.S.
[01:15:21.945 --> 01:15:24.606]  embassy heads on record saying they were told they were U.S.
[01:15:24.646 --> 01:15:26.186]  government agents, let them back in the country.
[01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:29.247]  There's no debating that these guys were U.S.
[01:15:29.287 --> 01:15:29.908]  government agents.
[01:15:30.668 --> 01:15:32.168]  Do you want to add more?
[01:15:32.188 --> 01:15:33.168]  I mean, do you have any other questions?
[01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:35.409]  I'll wait for the break.
[01:15:36.049 --> 01:15:38.170]  Well, I got a... You want me to hold you over?
[01:15:39.178 --> 01:15:40.501]  I really can't do that, my friend.
[01:15:40.922 --> 01:15:46.336]  We're going to come right back and get to more calls because I've got two other stories I've got to hit and we're almost out of time.
[01:15:52.216 --> 01:15:53.858]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[01:15:54.178 --> 01:16:01.544]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[01:16:01.705 --> 01:16:09.492]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[01:16:09.692 --> 01:16:10.773]  And there's no odor.
[01:16:11.013 --> 01:16:21.038]  Stabilized Allison gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[01:16:21.078 --> 01:16:29.322]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[01:16:29.602 --> 01:16:35.165]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[01:16:35.638 --> 01:16:44.287]  Visit truthandexcellence.com, click the Truth and Excellence banner on GCNlive.com, or call me, Amy Bjorklund, personally, at 805-595-2711.
[01:16:44.307 --> 01:16:44.347]  805-595-2711.
[01:16:52.401 --> 01:16:54.643]  Are you in sales or do you own your own business?
[01:16:55.104 --> 01:16:56.705]  If so, I want you to think of a number.
[01:16:57.005 --> 01:16:59.167]  Think of the amount of money you'd like to make this year.
[01:16:59.187 --> 01:17:00.008]  Do you have it?
[01:17:00.268 --> 01:17:01.529]  Okay, so what's stopping you?
[01:17:01.809 --> 01:17:02.730]  It's not your drive.
[01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:03.931]  It's not your skills.
[01:17:04.272 --> 01:17:06.914]  Chances are it's your ability to find new leads.
[01:17:07.214 --> 01:17:07.955]  It's not easy.
[01:17:07.995 --> 01:17:09.036]  It's not too good to be true.
[01:17:09.056 --> 01:17:12.820]  It's Sales Genie, the largest provider of the most up-to-date sales leads mailing lists and business credit reports.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.942]  And they want to give you 100 sales leads absolutely free.
[01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:32.999]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:17:59.076 --> 01:17:59.556]  We're good to go.
[01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:25.179]  Don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.

[01:19:40.866 --> 01:19:41.666]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:19:41.766 --> 01:19:42.907]  Agree or disagree?
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.303]  Alex wants to hear from you right now at 877-590-5525.
[01:20:12.543 --> 01:20:18.108]  Now, here's Alex Jones.
[01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:23.273]  You know, I got myself into trouble on this live Sunday edition.
[01:20:23.293 --> 01:20:31.960]  I said I was going to read this letter by Kevin Tillman, Pat Tillman's brother, really decrying what's happening right now with this criminal administration.
[01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:36.024]  We got Charlie, Joel, Henry, and a bunch of other callers all over the country saying,
[01:20:36.704 --> 01:20:37.205]  Calling in.
[01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:38.026]  I don't know what to do.
[01:20:38.406 --> 01:20:41.710]  Got Joel calling in from Cleveland off one of our affiliates.
[01:20:43.112 --> 01:20:45.294]  And I need to get to this.
[01:20:45.334 --> 01:20:47.517]  And I also promised to cover this little piece here.
[01:20:48.438 --> 01:20:55.286]  Robert Steele concludes there is evidence to indict Cheney and Rove on involvement in 9-11 as a coup d'etat.
[01:20:55.965 --> 01:21:00.806]  And, of course, Robert Steele was the highest ranking civilian member of the U.S.
[01:21:00.826 --> 01:21:03.567]  Marine Corps Intelligence from 88 to 92.
[01:21:03.607 --> 01:21:14.669]  He's a former clandestine service case officer, high level for the CIA, and he is a founder and CEO of a national intelligence Marine Corps organization and a bunch of other groups here.
[01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:16.149]  I'm trying to run through this fast.
[01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:19.370]  Also the founder of OSS.net.
[01:21:20.564 --> 01:21:24.565]  And he also, of course, campaigned for Bush and said vote for Bush in 2004.
[01:21:24.625 --> 01:21:29.107]  He's a big national Republican, very highly respected, a conservative.
[01:21:29.767 --> 01:21:40.191]  And he's done a complete analysis, research of 9-11, and has concluded that at the bare minimum, it is an inside job orchestrated and provocateur, and it looks like worse.
[01:21:40.871 --> 01:21:47.133]  Because if you really look at 9-11, instead of the straw men the media builds, and again by straw men, they don't attack what we really say about it.
[01:21:47.663 --> 01:21:52.869]  They make false claims about what we're saying and then go dismantle those arguments.
[01:21:55.942 --> 01:21:56.342]  We're good to go.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.762]  ...of the 7,000-plus family member group, say it's an inside job.
[01:22:27.102 --> 01:22:27.863]  I've been to New York.
[01:22:27.883 --> 01:22:31.205]  The majority of the police walk up and shake your hand and say, oh, thank you, it's an inside job.
[01:22:31.525 --> 01:22:34.027]  They want me to fly to Fox News Studios next Saturday.
[01:22:34.487 --> 01:22:35.908]  Now, I've only missed one of these shows.
[01:22:36.288 --> 01:22:37.809]  We may have somebody sitting in next week.
[01:22:38.129 --> 01:22:40.551]  I'm going to try to make Fox News do it via satellite.
[01:22:40.891 --> 01:22:41.892]  Why do they want to fly?
[01:22:41.912 --> 01:22:42.912]  They always want to do this.
[01:22:43.373 --> 01:22:51.238]  Fly me to New York just to be on Fox for ten minutes, two segments, next Saturday on Man Cow Show.
[01:22:51.378 --> 01:22:51.398]  I...
[01:22:52.881 --> 01:22:53.762]  We'll see what happens.
[01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.524]  I may just get on a plane and come back that night, but I'm tired of beating my brains out.
[01:22:58.245 --> 01:22:59.005]  We'll see what happens.
[01:22:59.846 --> 01:23:00.566]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:23:00.586 --> 01:23:01.267]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:23:02.288 --> 01:23:04.129]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joel in Cleveland.
[01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:05.770]  He wants to talk about secret societies.
[01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:07.111]  Joel, welcome, sir.
[01:23:07.151 --> 01:23:07.771]  Thanks for calling.
[01:23:08.172 --> 01:23:08.652]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:09.272 --> 01:23:09.913]  How are you listening?
[01:23:09.973 --> 01:23:11.534]  Are you listening to our Ohio affiliate?
[01:23:13.035 --> 01:23:16.017]  Yeah, actually, I listen to you over your podcast.
[01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.238]  I can't get the signal.
[01:23:17.838 --> 01:23:19.720]  Because we've got a station that goes into Cleveland, 900 AM.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:19.980]  Yeah, it...
[01:23:23.162 --> 01:23:25.303]  I'm a little far north for them.
[01:23:25.623 --> 01:23:26.003]  Gotcha.
[01:23:26.023 --> 01:23:26.243]  Sorry.
[01:23:26.263 --> 01:23:26.984]  Go ahead.
[01:23:27.924 --> 01:23:35.906]  I've noticed that the only thing snowballing faster and bigger than the 9-11 truth movement is your ego.
[01:23:36.646 --> 01:23:36.967]  Yes.
[01:23:37.987 --> 01:23:38.767]  Yes, it's true.
[01:23:38.867 --> 01:23:40.068]  I'm just joking.
[01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:41.568]  I do admire you.
[01:23:42.208 --> 01:23:45.589]  And I agree with about 92% of what you say.
[01:23:46.269 --> 01:23:49.150]  And I'm only calling in to disagree because you want people to.
[01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.311]  Okay, but let me just stop you.
[01:23:50.391 --> 01:23:50.771]  Actually, sir...
[01:23:52.987 --> 01:23:54.348]  I love life.
[01:23:54.568 --> 01:23:57.368]  I am totally in love with the beauty of nature.
[01:23:58.089 --> 01:24:04.490]  I am just totally tuned into the majesty of being alive, being here, seeing all of this.
[01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:07.471]  And if I come across as arrogant, it's not arrogant.
[01:24:08.011 --> 01:24:08.771]  I'm aggressive.
[01:24:08.871 --> 01:24:09.511]  I'm upset.
[01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:11.472]  I have to get hyped up to do this show.
[01:24:11.492 --> 01:24:12.692]  Oh, I know.
[01:24:12.872 --> 01:24:14.432]  I was just playing with you.
[01:24:14.613 --> 01:24:14.893]  Okay.
[01:24:14.973 --> 01:24:18.553]  Well, it's fine, though, because I need to be knocked back down to size.
[01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:20.614]  Frankly, I do have an ego, and it's out of control.
[01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:21.917]  But go ahead.
[01:24:22.017 --> 01:24:23.798]  That's what makes you fun to listen to.
[01:24:24.338 --> 01:24:24.718]  Okay.
[01:24:25.199 --> 01:24:26.139]  What's on your mind, my friend?
[01:24:26.279 --> 01:24:27.419]  Okay, here's my question.
[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:38.964]  Why do you have such admiration for the founding fathers when they were in the exact same occult Illuminati societies
[01:24:41.055 --> 01:24:47.141]  Well, it is true that a lot of them were Masons, but most Masons are not in the higher levels and involved in all that stuff.
[01:24:47.221 --> 01:24:52.186]  And George Washington, before he died, wrote that the Masons were being taken over by, quote, black lodges.
[01:24:52.206 --> 01:24:54.248]  It has nothing to do with black people.
[01:24:54.528 --> 01:24:56.390]  You know, the Illuminati, and the Illuminati's real.
[01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:57.611]  It's in the encyclopedia, folks.
[01:24:58.292 --> 01:25:01.793]  Well, I agree that they were better, but I mean, they weren't just Masons.
[01:25:01.813 --> 01:25:02.233]  I mean, you had...
[01:25:25.536 --> 01:25:27.637]  Benjamin Franklin and the Hellfire Club.
[01:25:27.797 --> 01:25:28.617]  Mainstream news.
[01:25:28.677 --> 01:25:29.738]  Huge sex orgies.
[01:25:29.798 --> 01:25:30.498]  Satan worship.
[01:25:30.918 --> 01:25:33.119]  Dead bodies uncovered of small children.
[01:25:33.439 --> 01:25:34.660]  The Times of London reported it.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:35.460]  His home in London.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.260]  He was a British agent the whole time.
[01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:39.661]  Benjamin Franklin worked against us the whole time.
[01:25:40.142 --> 01:25:40.362]  Yeah.
[01:25:41.682 --> 01:25:43.763]  Okay, and... Listen, I'm out of time.
[01:25:43.803 --> 01:25:44.083]  Real quick.
[01:25:44.183 --> 01:25:44.463]  Okay.
[01:25:46.364 --> 01:25:46.804]  You know what?
[01:25:46.904 --> 01:25:48.605]  My next question is too big.
[01:25:48.665 --> 01:25:49.025]  Go ahead.
[01:25:49.045 --> 01:25:49.505]  Throw it out.
[01:25:49.545 --> 01:25:50.325]  I'm not going to stop you.
[01:25:51.306 --> 01:25:51.646]  What is it?
[01:25:52.646 --> 01:25:54.647]  Okay, the other thing I disagree with you about
[01:25:55.356 --> 01:26:05.679]  Is, um, when you explain the, um, the driving force for why the Illuminati does what they do, and you say that... It's because they don't want us to have the life extension technologies, they want it for themselves.
[01:26:05.799 --> 01:26:11.240]  Oh, no, I'm talking about when you say, um, that, uh, it's social Darwinism.
[01:26:12.281 --> 01:26:14.221]  And I would disagree with that.
[01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:16.962]  Well, social Darwinism has nothing to do with Darwinism.
[01:26:17.002 --> 01:26:23.464]  It's saying, we're the elite because we're in power, we have the right to kill and rule whoever we want, and that is their attitude.
[01:26:23.824 --> 01:26:24.524]  Yeah, but that doesn't...
[01:26:25.031 --> 01:26:38.718]  For me, that does not explain, social Darwinism does not explain why every ruling family has been interbreeding for thousands and thousands of years.
[01:26:38.758 --> 01:26:39.959]  Well, that's what elites always do.
[01:26:39.979 --> 01:26:42.320]  That's what royalty does, to keep the power in the family.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.961]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:26:44.001 --> 01:26:44.561]  We've got to move.
[01:26:44.581 --> 01:26:46.802]  I don't want to cheat everybody now, time-wise.
[01:26:46.822 --> 01:26:48.023]  International money powers.
[01:26:48.483 --> 01:26:50.164]  Charlie, I don't know where Charlie's calling from.
[01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.204]  Charlie, where are you calling us from?
[01:26:51.785 --> 01:26:54.066]  Where are you calling from?
[01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:56.071]  Hello?
[01:26:56.231 --> 01:26:56.391]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:57.272]  Where are you calling from?
[01:26:58.453 --> 01:26:58.833]  Hello?
[01:26:59.434 --> 01:27:00.394]  Got to let you go, sir.
[01:27:00.474 --> 01:27:02.436]  Let's go ahead and talk to Henry in Dale Valley.
[01:27:02.776 --> 01:27:03.476]  Go ahead, Henry.
[01:27:03.516 --> 01:27:03.857]  Welcome.
[01:27:04.317 --> 01:27:04.577]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:04.597 --> 01:27:05.157]  How are you doing?
[01:27:05.217 --> 01:27:05.558]  Good, sir.
[01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:06.358]  Good show.
[01:27:06.378 --> 01:27:12.763]  Listen, I'd like to find out what your take is on this American Union, and I'm sure you know about it already.
[01:27:12.963 --> 01:27:14.143]  Yeah, you must have just joined us.
[01:27:14.364 --> 01:27:19.527]  There's a couple of lawsuits, I think, one is in Irwin, Texas, and the other one is in Royce City, Texas.
[01:27:19.687 --> 01:27:20.087]  Yes.
[01:27:20.128 --> 01:27:22.089]  Parliament for not speaking Spanish.
[01:27:22.728 --> 01:27:23.068]  Yes.
[01:27:23.168 --> 01:27:29.551]  The majority of counties have signed on against the North American Union.
[01:27:29.651 --> 01:27:33.652]  Texas business owners are getting letters saying, here's your American Union ID number.
[01:27:34.032 --> 01:27:35.933]  And I'm not familiar with the point you raised.
[01:27:35.973 --> 01:27:37.414]  What's happening about speaking Spanish?
[01:27:37.774 --> 01:27:38.794]  Well, did you know that?
[01:27:39.134 --> 01:27:39.595]  Fill me in.
[01:27:39.735 --> 01:27:49.819]  There's two lawsuits I heard the other day on one of his talk programs over in Irwin, Texas, and I think another one in Royce City, wherever that is.
[01:27:50.379 --> 01:27:50.459]  And
[01:27:51.164 --> 01:27:56.245]  Well, I know that illegal aliens are now suing businesses that fire them when they find out they're illegal.
[01:27:56.785 --> 01:27:59.206]  And I know Royce City is up by Dallas.
[01:27:59.246 --> 01:28:00.806]  It's east of Dallas.
[01:28:00.826 --> 01:28:01.166]  Oh, really?
[01:28:01.186 --> 01:28:01.266]  Yeah.
[01:28:01.286 --> 01:28:05.187]  Boy, I tell you, I used to go fishing out there in a lake.
[01:28:20.066 --> 01:28:22.467]  Well, I'm ignorant, sir, so I'll have to check it out.
[01:28:22.527 --> 01:28:22.667]  Yeah.
[01:28:22.847 --> 01:28:27.409]  And, you know, do you know anything coming down that pipe that
[01:28:44.692 --> 01:28:47.594]  They would eventually maybe use Mexican police for... Oh, yes, sir.
[01:28:47.634 --> 01:28:50.416]  That's actually in the official... In fact, I meant to get to that.
[01:28:50.796 --> 01:28:54.498]  That's in my stack of mainstream news off of the Army Times.
[01:28:54.858 --> 01:29:03.764]  They say Mexican troops will patrol America, and that is actually in my stack, and I didn't have time... It's up on prisonplanet.com right now, Army Times.
[01:29:04.024 --> 01:29:05.565]  They've signed the North American agreement.
[01:29:06.365 --> 01:29:12.908]  Mexico is going to be given major port facilities in Chicago, in Kansas City, and actually east of Austin.
[01:29:13.469 --> 01:29:14.269]  And U.S.
[01:29:14.309 --> 01:29:17.130]  troops and police will be in Mexico ruling the Mexicans.
[01:29:17.551 --> 01:29:19.031]  Mexicans will be here ruling us.
[01:29:19.331 --> 01:29:21.212]  And Canadians will be down here ruling us.
[01:29:21.533 --> 01:29:22.273]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:29:22.293 --> 01:29:23.413]  That's mainstream news.
[01:29:23.453 --> 01:29:26.135]  Again, you couldn't make stuff up this crazy.
[01:29:27.155 --> 01:29:28.016]  We've got to go to break.
[01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:31.977]  And when we get back from break, I'm in an emergency here.
[01:29:31.997 --> 01:29:35.059]  I've got loaded phone lines, and I've got to read Pat Tillman's letter.
[01:29:35.618 --> 01:29:39.100]  I'm going to give each caller about 30 seconds, and I'm not a good newsreader when I read fast.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.001]  I'm actually real good if I read slow.
[01:29:41.301 --> 01:29:45.203]  I sound like Peter Jennings with a Texas accent, being sarcastic.
[01:29:45.483 --> 01:29:48.024]  Point is, I'm going to try to read the Pat Tillman Brothers letter.
[01:29:48.424 --> 01:29:49.385]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:49.805 --> 01:29:50.525]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.586 --> 01:29:51.426]  Final segment.
[01:29:51.466 --> 01:29:51.986]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.266 --> 01:29:56.308]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:29:56.528 --> 01:29:59.930]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:30:00.110 --> 01:30:03.552]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:30:03.829 --> 01:30:07.090]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:12.573]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:30:12.613 --> 01:30:22.237]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardavite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:30:22.357 --> 01:30:23.698]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[01:30:23.738 --> 01:30:29.140]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:34.083]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:30:34.103 --> 01:30:35.544]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:30:35.705 --> 01:30:39.567]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:30:39.627 --> 01:30:40.448]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[01:30:52.191 --> 01:30:56.492]  If you're tired of spending a small fortune every time you fill up, now you can do something about it.
[01:30:56.752 --> 01:31:03.233]  Ethos FR, a product used all over the world, has reported savings of up to 19% on gas and even reduced emissions of up to 30%.
[01:31:03.953 --> 01:31:08.694]  Ethos FR is easy to use and works with any kind of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.
[01:31:08.854 --> 01:31:16.156]  Ethos FR works by reformulating the gas in your tank to burn more completely, resulting in a cleaner engine, better mileage, more power, and fewer emissions.

[01:31:22.805 --> 01:31:25.287]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:27.669]  Mine found it in precious metals.

[01:32:46.818 --> 01:32:49.979]  Have you always felt something just wasn't right with the churches?
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:54.001]  All the pagan propaganda, Easter eggs, idols, Christmas trees, memorials for the dead at Halloween?
[01:32:54.081 --> 01:32:54.902]  What about communion?
[01:32:54.942 --> 01:32:59.984]  Why would the Messiah institute a symbolic blood-drinking ceremony which breaks the Torah law as well as civilized social customs?
[01:33:15.951 --> 01:33:17.772]  Pastors and priests have no answers.
[01:33:18.033 --> 01:33:20.775]  Two Witnesses Ministries has solved the communion conspiracy.

[01:34:33.553 --> 01:34:34.874]  And you've got a headache now.
[01:34:36.042 --> 01:34:38.564]  I just had to make fun of myself, because I like that liner.
[01:34:38.584 --> 01:34:40.406]  It's very nice, but you talk about ego.
[01:34:40.766 --> 01:34:42.107]  You're experiencing.
[01:34:42.627 --> 01:34:44.088]  Oh, he's so incredible.
[01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:46.610]  Come on!
[01:34:46.971 --> 01:34:47.831]  I'm just having some fun.
[01:34:47.851 --> 01:34:49.172]  You've got to be self-deprecating.
[01:34:49.192 --> 01:34:54.837]  All right, I'm going to try to talk to Pam, Charlie, and Patrick, but I've got to read this Pat Tillman Brothers letter.
[01:34:56.038 --> 01:34:56.738]  How's that for English?
[01:34:56.938 --> 01:34:59.280]  You've got to read Pat Tillman Brothers letter.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.281]  Here it is.
[01:35:00.301 --> 01:35:01.322]  It's the end of the week.
[01:35:01.342 --> 01:35:02.002]  The start of a new week.
[01:35:02.022 --> 01:35:03.023]  For me, it just never ends.
[01:35:03.581 --> 01:35:04.001]  We're good to go.
[01:35:21.738 --> 01:35:24.699]  This report is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:35:24.759 --> 01:35:25.619]  I recommend you go read it.
[01:35:25.979 --> 01:35:29.780]  He says, it's Pat's birthday on November 6th, with elections the day after that.
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:34.021]  It gets me thinking about a conversation I had with Pat before we joined the military.
[01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:42.343]  He spoke about the risk with signing the papers, how once we committed, we were at the mercy of the American leadership and the American people.
[01:35:42.463 --> 01:35:43.863]  The American people don't know anything, buddy.
[01:35:44.603 --> 01:35:48.944]  How we could be thrown in a direction not of our own volition.
[01:35:49.423 --> 01:35:54.145]  How fighting as a soldier would leave us without a voice until we got out.
[01:35:55.806 --> 01:35:58.688]  Much has happened since we handed over our voice.
[01:35:58.968 --> 01:36:13.255]  Somehow we were sent to invade a nation because it was a direct threat to the American people or to the world or harbored terrorists or was involved in September 11th attacks or received weapons-grade uranium from Niger.
[01:36:13.515 --> 01:36:14.436]  All this is lies, of course.
[01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:31.803]  Or had mobile weapons labs, that was for pumping up balloons, or WMDs, or had the need to be liberated, or we needed to establish a democracy, or stop an insurgency, or stop a civil war we created that can't be called a civil war, even though it is something like that.
[01:36:33.044 --> 01:36:36.225]  Kevin Tillman, who I'm going to be interviewing soon, Kevin, it's meant to fail.
[01:36:36.265 --> 01:36:37.986]  That's how they stay there longer and make bigger profits.
[01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:39.873]  It's official documents, Kevin.
[01:36:39.893 --> 01:36:41.676]  I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it makes sense to them.
[01:36:41.696 --> 01:36:43.840]  When Bush says that the strategy's working, he's telling the truth.
[01:36:44.321 --> 01:36:51.774]  Somehow, America has become a country that projects everything that it is not and condemns everything that it is.
[01:36:52.759 --> 01:37:07.272]  Somehow, our elected leaders were subverting international law and humanity by setting up secret prisons around the world, secretly kidnapping people, secretly holding them indefinitely, secretly not charging them with anything, secretly torturing them.
[01:37:07.592 --> 01:37:12.377]  Somehow, that overt policy of torture became the fault of a few bad apples in the
[01:37:16.776 --> 01:37:19.660]  And, by the way, they used the torture evidence in the fake trials.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.123]  Oh, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:37:22.643 --> 01:37:34.197]  Somehow, back at home, support for the soldiers meant having a five-year-old kindergartner scribble a picture with crayons and send it overseas or slapping stickers on the car, as I always say, made by Chinese slaves.
[01:37:34.597 --> 01:37:37.619]  Or lobbying Congress for an extra pad and a helmet.
[01:37:37.979 --> 01:37:47.303]  It's interesting that a soldier on his third or fourth tour should care about a drawing from a five-year-old or a faded sticker on a car as his friends die around him.
[01:37:47.864 --> 01:37:58.549]  Or an extra pad in his helmet as if it will protect him when an IED throws his vehicle 50 feet into the air as his body comes apart and his skin melts to the sea.
[01:37:59.875 --> 01:38:04.640]  Somehow, the more soldiers that die, the more legitimate the illegal invasion becomes.
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:16.652]  Somehow, American leadership, whose only credit is lying to its people and illegally invading a nation, has been allowed to steal the courage, virtue, and honor of its soldiers on the ground.
[01:38:17.112 --> 01:38:18.113]  Oh, I say that every day.
[01:38:18.153 --> 01:38:20.195]  I agree, Mr. Tillman, who served himself.
[01:38:20.215 --> 01:38:22.898]  He'll be called a traitor now by the pot-bellied neocons.
[01:38:23.473 --> 01:38:33.836]  Somehow, those afraid to fight an illegal invasion decades ago are now allowed to send soldiers to die for an illegal invasion they started.
[01:38:34.622 --> 01:38:36.843]  They're all a bunch of chicken hawks running for cover.
[01:38:37.224 --> 01:38:40.446]  Somehow, faking character, virtue, and strength is tolerated.
[01:38:40.726 --> 01:38:43.588]  Somehow, profiting from tragedy and horror is tolerated.
[01:38:43.948 --> 01:38:47.310]  Somehow, the death of tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people is tolerated.
[01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:51.053]  Somehow, subversion of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution is tolerated.
[01:38:51.293 --> 01:38:53.394]  Somehow, suspension of habeas corpus for U.S.
[01:38:53.434 --> 01:38:55.896]  citizens is, and I added U.S.
[01:38:55.936 --> 01:38:57.977]  citizens, is supposed to keep this country safe.
[01:38:58.117 --> 01:38:59.038]  We're good to go.
[01:38:59.138 --> 01:38:59.618]  We're good to go.
[01:39:13.431 --> 01:39:15.332]  Narrative is more important than reality.
[01:39:15.713 --> 01:39:18.875]  Somehow, Americans on average, bro, don't know what a narrative is.
[01:39:19.475 --> 01:39:25.859]  Somehow, America has become a country that projects everything that it is not and condemns everything that it is.
[01:39:26.259 --> 01:39:36.946]  Somehow, the most reasonable, trusted, and respected country in the world has become one of the most irrational, belligerent, and feared, and distrusted countries in the world because the grandson of the top U.S.
[01:39:36.986 --> 01:39:39.368]  Nazi agents is now the president, fool.
[01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:43.931]  Again, I'm not trying to call you a fool, but you just don't know how really bad it is, okay?
[01:39:44.291 --> 01:39:45.253]  We're in a lot of trouble here.
[01:39:45.673 --> 01:39:46.394]  We're all fools.
[01:39:46.454 --> 01:39:46.934]  I'm a fool.
[01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:48.036]  I didn't know how bad it was.
[01:39:49.357 --> 01:39:55.844]  Somehow, being politically informed, diligent, and skeptical has been replaced by apathy through active ignorance.
[01:39:55.984 --> 01:39:56.245]  That's right.
[01:39:56.265 --> 01:39:58.247]  You have to actively be an idiot not to know the truth.
[01:39:58.855 --> 01:39:59.336]  I agree with you.
[01:39:59.576 --> 01:40:06.784]  Somehow, the same incompetent, narcissistic, virtuous, vacuous, malicious criminals are still in charge of this country.
[01:40:07.244 --> 01:40:08.586]  Somehow, this is tolerated.
[01:40:08.986 --> 01:40:10.968]  Somehow, nobody is accountable for this.
[01:40:11.609 --> 01:40:14.152]  And he goes on to talk about how they're total criminals.
[01:40:14.492 --> 01:40:15.913]  And I am out of time for that.
[01:40:15.933 --> 01:40:17.055]  I want to take a few final calls.
[01:40:19.349 --> 01:40:20.250]  I want to just say this.
[01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:21.071]  We've all been fools.
[01:40:21.091 --> 01:40:21.891]  We've all been in the dark.
[01:40:22.171 --> 01:40:23.492]  Believe me, all I do is study this.
[01:40:23.593 --> 01:40:25.414]  I spent four hours today studying.
[01:40:25.854 --> 01:40:26.675]  Four hours.
[01:40:26.715 --> 01:40:32.239]  I could have been out in the beauty with my family, marching down a green belt or fishing on a beautiful lake.
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:33.741]  I didn't do it for you folks.
[01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:36.763]  I sat there reading documents until I got a headache.
[01:40:37.243 --> 01:40:44.169]  And let me tell you, I can't even with the words, with the voice box God gave me and the brain God gave me, I can't even tell you how bad it is.
[01:40:44.529 --> 01:40:45.850]  It's so bad.
[01:40:46.211 --> 01:40:47.892]  It blows my mind.
[01:40:50.026 --> 01:40:52.307]  Let's go ahead and talk to Charlie.
[01:40:52.827 --> 01:40:56.148]  Charlie, you're on KLBJ Blasting Out Worldwide.
[01:40:56.188 --> 01:40:56.488]  Go ahead.
[01:40:56.988 --> 01:40:57.808]  Hello, Alex.
[01:40:58.328 --> 01:41:00.009]  I'm sorry we got cut off earlier.
[01:41:00.449 --> 01:41:00.749]  It's okay.
[01:41:00.769 --> 01:41:01.029]  Go ahead.
[01:41:01.049 --> 01:41:02.169]  We're almost out of time.
[01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.950]  I've got to ask you something.
[01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.470]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:41:06.231 --> 01:41:07.931]  Something everybody always asks me.
[01:41:07.991 --> 01:41:08.771]  I'm not debating.
[01:41:09.291 --> 01:41:10.492]  This is from pure ignorance.
[01:41:11.592 --> 01:41:18.614]  Everybody asks me, well, if these international bankers and everything are trying to destroy America...
[01:41:20.245 --> 01:41:25.427]  What I'm asking is, why do they want to destroy our economy?
[01:41:25.867 --> 01:41:26.907]  That's their cash cow.
[01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:27.907]  No, no, no.
[01:41:27.967 --> 01:41:29.068]  Sir, sir, sir.
[01:41:29.128 --> 01:41:30.308]  I don't really understand.
[01:41:30.488 --> 01:41:30.888]  Sure, sure.
[01:41:30.968 --> 01:41:31.769]  Let me try to answer that.
[01:41:31.789 --> 01:41:33.009]  It always whines at me like that.
[01:41:33.089 --> 01:41:34.569]  Let me try to, no, no.
[01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:37.490]  Or they say, how can they fail in Iraq, but they can carry out 9-11?
[01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:39.851]  You know, if Bush did it.
[01:41:41.115 --> 01:41:42.055]  Well, number one, Bush is a puppet.
[01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:42.655]  He didn't do it.
[01:41:42.695 --> 01:41:43.956]  The military industrial complex did.
[01:41:44.196 --> 01:41:47.856]  No, their own Pentagon documents that are public say they want to, quote, fail.
[01:41:48.076 --> 01:41:49.497]  The war on drugs is meant to fail.
[01:41:49.677 --> 01:41:53.177]  It's all meant to go on and on and on and on and take over the entire economy.
[01:41:53.417 --> 01:42:00.659]  The central banks print the money, sir, and to consolidate and get total control, they have to blow out economies to buy up everything for pennies on the dollar.
[01:42:01.079 --> 01:42:04.039]  That's why they're doing this, sir, and they're doing it incrementally.
[01:42:04.299 --> 01:42:05.520]  It's in the Times of London.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.820]  It's in the Financial Times.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.203]  Alex, I don't know why you're on Neocon Radio, but the truth has to get out.
[01:42:26.023 --> 01:42:27.404]  Well, I wouldn't call it neocon radio.
[01:42:27.424 --> 01:42:34.166]  They've got a lot of diverse opinions and views and different types of talk show hosts out of this studio and out of MS Communications and Genesis.
[01:42:34.586 --> 01:42:46.150]  Okay, well, two reasons not to vote as a vote against the false paradigm of Democrat versus Republican, which is both the same thing.
[01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.630]  Yes.
[01:42:47.891 --> 01:42:51.752]  I think when you don't have a third-party candidate, a real viable candidate,
[01:42:53.506 --> 01:42:54.768]  I think you have to not vote.
[01:42:54.908 --> 01:42:59.897]  And also, by not voting, it's a vote against the electronic voting machine.
[01:43:00.242 --> 01:43:13.889]  Well, I hear you, but we need to fight those machines and make sure that the fraudulent nature of them be changed, that there is a paper record, that they not be secretive and not have... I mean, it's admitted that it's a fraud, okay?
[01:43:13.909 --> 01:43:14.689]  It's not a mistake.
[01:43:14.729 --> 01:43:15.749]  They're running scams.
[01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:17.530]  It's as old as votes.
[01:43:17.951 --> 01:43:19.911]  People have been cheating.
[01:43:20.112 --> 01:43:24.874]  2,500 years ago in Greece, they were cheating with the votes, with black stones and white stones in a bucket.
[01:43:26.255 --> 01:43:27.195]  A quick program note.
[01:43:28.306 --> 01:43:39.260]  I'm going to be at the Waterloo Records and Video on 6th and... Well, it's right there downtown, right by the Whole Foods.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:40.381]  I'm going to be down there 5 to 6.30 on...
[01:43:42.902 --> 01:43:48.525]  Yeah, 6th and Lamar, coming up on Halloween, for an hour and a half, giving a speech and signing Terror Storm.
[01:43:48.565 --> 01:43:51.107]  My new film is going to be in stores nationwide.
[01:43:51.167 --> 01:43:52.828]  I mean Barnes & Noble end caps.
[01:43:53.228 --> 01:43:54.348]  I mean Virgin Records.
[01:43:54.448 --> 01:43:56.489]  I mean thousands of stores.
[01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:59.511]  Terror Storm is going to be in stores nationwide.
[01:43:59.911 --> 01:44:05.274]  So please, people all over the country, get out there, buy it in the stores, support it, give it as a Christmas present.
[01:44:05.554 --> 01:44:10.977]  Terror Storm will be available nationwide starting October 31st in most stores in the country.
[01:44:11.277 --> 01:44:12.058]  It is very exciting.
[01:44:12.518 --> 01:44:15.941]  I apologize to Pam in Northwest Austin.
[01:44:15.961 --> 01:44:17.402]  Pam, we just go to calls and order.
[01:44:17.682 --> 01:44:22.565]  Call me back next Sunday, and I will go to you first, okay?
[01:44:22.965 --> 01:44:23.786]  I'm really sorry.
[01:44:23.806 --> 01:44:24.647]  I'm sorry to others.
[01:44:25.888 --> 01:44:30.211]  And go to prisonplanet.com and watch Terror Storm for free via Google Video.
[01:44:30.451 --> 01:44:31.271]  It's up in the top 100.
[01:44:31.992 --> 01:44:33.653]  Please pass the link around to everybody.
[01:44:34.253 --> 01:44:36.515]  Terror Storm, my new film, proving government-sponsored terror.
[01:44:36.535 --> 01:44:37.956]  All right, have a great week.
[01:44:38.076 --> 01:44:38.917]  Be safe out there.
[01:44:38.977 --> 01:44:39.317]  Take care.
[01:44:43.706 --> 01:44:44.707]  Looking for profit?
[01:44:44.787 --> 01:44:46.568]  Looking for safety and security?
[01:44:46.628 --> 01:44:49.731]  The $10 Olympic Memorative Gold Coin offers both.
[01:44:49.771 --> 01:44:57.337]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[01:44:57.397 --> 01:45:00.920]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
