[00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:06.473]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.214]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:09.996]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.477]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:13.138]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.622]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:22.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:24.227]  Music
[00:00:43.723 --> 00:00:45.044]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:45.464]  Welcome.
[00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:50.647]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:52.689]  It is now the third day of August 2006.
[00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:54.250]  Coming up in 30 minutes...
[00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:04.754]  Dr. Bob Bowman will join us for the third time on air in the last six months or so.
[00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:17.137]  He's the former head of the Pentagon Star Wars Directed Energy and Missile Defense Program, and an intercept pilot also flew 101 combat missions over Vietnam.
[00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:18.938]  He'll be joining us to discuss...
[00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:32.175]  The release of the new tapes, the selected release of some of the tapes from NORAD, and try to play some of the clips and help us make sense of them.
[00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:38.159]  And then in the third hour, Paul Joseph Watson had joined us in about three weeks.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.185]  He'll be joining us for a news blitz, going over a whole bunch of different important news stories from around the world.
[00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:52.008]  Meanwhile, we'll be covering the latest developments in the Middle East.
[00:01:52.568 --> 00:01:53.469]  Brace yourselves.
[00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.471]  America will attack Iran and Syria in October.
[00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.293]  That's what Gull is saying.
[00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:12.581]  The former chief of ISI, Major General Hamid Gull, has predicted that America would definitely attack Iran and Syria simultaneously in October.
[00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:16.384]  This is in the big papers out of Pakistan and some of the Western news wires.
[00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:25.074]  He was talking after attending a Hammurati Majelis Shore Tuesday evening.
[00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:25.615]  He also...
[00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:27.597]  We're good to go.
[00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.395]  Boy, that's true.
[00:02:55.795 --> 00:03:09.786]  How many people know or remember that Rumsfeld gave press conferences saying, don't worry, we're going to take over Baghdad and Iraq, piece of cake, as the invasion began back in March of 2003, saying that we have openly bought them off.
[00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:16.191]  And later he got questioned about it and said that he'd never said that when they openly admitted it.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:27.251]  The general went on to analyze that Israel would soon be forced to stop its land strike, but would continue its horrific, heinous air strikes against Lebanon, converting it to ruins.
[00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:34.399]  He also predicted that after Iran and Syria, Saudi Arabia would also meet the same fate, followed by Pakistan.
[00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:51.892]  Got to remember that Pakistan has conservatively 50 high-powered nukes and missiles to deliver them, thanks to our government under Clinton and Bush, allowing them through AQ Khan Laboratories to develop those weapons, and our government and the British government helping give them that.
[00:03:53.413 --> 00:04:01.177]  So Pakistan is teetering right now, despite the dictator our government helped install, President Musharraf.
[00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:04.729]  Israel has resumed its airstrikes on Beirut.
[00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:05.429]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.090]  And there's a new demon.
[00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.970]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.791]  It's all over.
[00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:09.811]  Hide under your beds.
[00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:10.971]  Give up all of your freedoms.
[00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:14.433]  Let secret police in black masks search your home.
[00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:15.853]  Take microchips.
[00:04:15.913 --> 00:04:17.214]  Drink extra fluoride.
[00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:18.955]  Only that will keep you safe.
[00:04:19.095 --> 00:04:20.855]  Open the borders wide open to save us.
[00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:23.937]  Osama's evil spawn is in Lebanon.
[00:04:24.257 --> 00:04:25.938]  The son of bin Laden.
[00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:27.498]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:04:27.518 --> 00:04:29.419]  He was released from house arrest.
[00:04:30.288 --> 00:04:33.410]  The New World Order has released the Kraken.
[00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.692]  Zeus has opened the underwater gates.
[00:04:37.312 --> 00:04:40.474]  And the great Leviathan is rising.
[00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:44.236]  The son of Bin Laden is upon us.
[00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:46.657]  Run for your lives!
[00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:50.459]  Destroy the Bill of Rights or we're all dead!
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.500]  Dead, I tell you!
[00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:55.349]  Oh, no!
[00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.331]  A new Goldstein!
[00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.673]  It's all coming up after the break.
[00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:07.660]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.962]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.322 --> 00:05:17.929]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.646 --> 00:05:25.689]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:37.575]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:41.357]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.797 --> 00:05:43.718]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.058 --> 00:05:47.900]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:03.850]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.952]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.232 --> 00:06:11.374]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.814 --> 00:06:12.634]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:17.517]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.001 --> 00:06:20.122]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.622 --> 00:06:35.309]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:42.473]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.773 --> 00:06:45.934]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.335 --> 00:06:48.877]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:07.114]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:09.115]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:15.739]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:22.202]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.462 --> 00:07:29.946]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:30.566]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:07.352]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.197 --> 00:08:20.389]  Massive escalations in the Israeli bombardment, the leveling of every major town and city in Lebanon, including Beirut.
[00:08:22.222 --> 00:08:27.808]  Every few hours, new reports of ambulances and convoys of innocent men, women, and children being blasted.
[00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:32.513]  Israel is bombing right up to the border yet again with Syria.
[00:08:34.656 --> 00:08:39.581]  A sovereign country, Lebanon, that kicked Syria out a few years ago that had an elected government
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.181]  We're good to go.
[00:08:54.662 --> 00:09:01.985]  Now it's all been basically blown out of proportion, and Israel is openly talking about going into Iran, going into Syria.
[00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:06.307]  Hundreds of bunker busters, as you know, from the U.S.
[00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:10.589]  have been shipped to Israel for the attack on Iran.
[00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:21.794]  And while all of this is happening, Osama's evil spawn in Lebanon, the New York Post, Rupert Murdoch's tabloid,
[00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:29.428]  A son of Osama bin Laden has gone from Iran to Lebanon with a mission to organize terror attacks against Israel.
[00:09:29.808 --> 00:09:31.609]  It was reported yesterday.
[00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:33.569]  Saeed bin Laden.
[00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:34.670]  Learn that name.
[00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.691]  For now, another 50 years, he'll be menacing us.
[00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:47.974]  Every time they search your car, take your children into CPS custody, or force you on Ritalin or Prozac, or steal your private property, it'll always be because of Saeed.
[00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:50.767]  The elite taking total control.
[00:09:50.787 --> 00:09:51.988]  This is for your best interest.
[00:09:52.288 --> 00:09:55.090]  To battle Saeed bin Laden.
[00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:08.882]  Doesn't matter when the British took over Saudi Arabia with Lawrence of Arabia that they took the one Bedouin tribe, the Sauds, and put them into power and named the country the House of Saud or the House of Saudi Arabia.
[00:10:10.223 --> 00:10:10.884]  It doesn't matter.
[00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:16.449]  The bin Ladens have been MI6 for now going, what, over 80 plus years.
[00:10:17.498 --> 00:10:24.101]  It doesn't matter if they aided Norman Schwarzkopf's father and Kermit Roosevelt in the overthrow of Iran.
[00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.162]  It doesn't matter.
[00:10:25.182 --> 00:10:29.304]  They've always served to attack the Serbs or to attack the Russians.
[00:10:29.344 --> 00:10:31.425]  They always follow globalist orders.
[00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:33.506]  An incredible servant family.
[00:10:34.186 --> 00:10:39.049]  And they've probably given Bin Laden and his sons and others Congressional Medal of Honor in secret.
[00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:41.210]  I mean, I'm not even joking at this point.
[00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.711]  It is that sick.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.301]  And out in the open.
[00:10:45.581 --> 00:10:48.524]  So now, Saeed!
[00:10:48.544 --> 00:10:52.128]  Oh, it's all over.
[00:10:52.188 --> 00:10:55.351]  We've got to just give up all of our rights and attack everyone now.
[00:10:56.692 --> 00:11:07.283]  Saeed bin Laden, 27, one of the terror mastermind's eldest son, was released by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard last Friday, according to the German daily Die Welt.
[00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:15.152]  From the Lebanese border, he has the task of building Islamist terror cells and preparing them to fight with Hezbollah.
[00:11:15.812 --> 00:11:26.881]  The paper said, quoting intelligence sources, apparently Tehran is conducting and recruiting Lebanese refugees in Syria for the fight against Israel using bin Laden's help.
[00:11:27.422 --> 00:11:30.284]  Oh, the intelligence agency says so.
[00:11:30.364 --> 00:11:31.205]  It must be true.
[00:11:31.997 --> 00:11:38.510]  I'm sure he'll be on TV now talking about his father and how he's going to crush us and how the Lebanese all work for him.
[00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.078]  So now all the Lebanese must die because they're with bin Laden, you see.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.102]  The young bin Laden was supposedly under house arrest in Iran.
[00:11:48.543 --> 00:11:48.683]  Oh!
[00:11:48.843 --> 00:11:57.308]  In 2004, Iranian former minister Kamal Karzai said the country had jailed about a dozen al-Qaeda suspects and would put them on trial.
[00:11:57.888 --> 00:12:03.371]  Among them was bin Laden and Saif al-Adel, the terror network's security chief.
[00:12:03.811 --> 00:12:12.016]  Up until this latest move, intelligence officials said that Saif, who speaks fluent English, was part of a small cadre running al-Qaeda groups
[00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:13.277]  From Iran.
[00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:14.337]  Yes, yes.
[00:12:14.738 --> 00:12:22.283]  Doesn't matter if our government openly gave bin Laden another $6 billion and openly funds them through Iran to attack the Serbs.
[00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:22.983]  That's all admitted.
[00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:23.644]  Senate report.
[00:12:24.064 --> 00:12:25.965]  You see, now they're going to get us.
[00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:34.811]  Our general view is Iran certainly does have a few al-Qaeda-related figures, said a counterterrorism official who asked about the Die Welt report.
[00:12:35.091 --> 00:12:39.234]  The general perception is Iran keeps these people as a bargaining chip.
[00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:41.604]  Well, not anymore.
[00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:45.126]  Why, they've released him just to destroy us.
[00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:57.195]  I don't know about you, but I'm going to lock both my doors tonight, and maybe I'll sleep with a pistol under my pillow, because Bin Laden, Bin Laden is under the table.
[00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:07.183]  When there's a tornado, or when somebody slips on the stairs, or when you have a heart attack, or when you don't have good credit, it's all Bin Laden.
[00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:16.017]  And when the sun comes up in the morning and the crops come in good, and when you have a good day or make a good business deal, you thank Bush and the neocons.
[00:13:16.417 --> 00:13:22.299]  Everything good flows from them, and everything bad flows from the new Satan, Saeed bin Laden.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.921]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic here.
[00:13:24.961 --> 00:13:28.422]  It's just, when is it going to end?
[00:13:28.522 --> 00:13:37.206]  Every one of these Islamo-fascist terrorists that we hear about in the media, every time you track them back and kick a rock over, it's intelligence agencies looking back at you.
[00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:44.807]  And we don't even know if Saeed bin Laden is in Iran.
[00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:48.729]  I mean, this is the same media that tells us Saddam throws babies out of incubators.
[00:13:49.049 --> 00:13:50.930]  Turns out it's total PR fabrication.
[00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.331]  The same media that claims they make Jews wear yellow stars.
[00:13:54.951 --> 00:14:01.134]  This is the same media that told us that Iran had the two captured Israeli soldiers for sure.
[00:14:01.754 --> 00:14:08.437]  This is the same media that, again, bought over $100 million in fake letters to the editor.
[00:14:09.288 --> 00:14:13.670]  1.6 billion that we know about buying off news reporters and for fake newscasts.
[00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.450]  I mean, never forget that.
[00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.132]  You cannot believe anything that comes out of these intelligence agencies.
[00:14:20.632 --> 00:14:26.594]  The only thing I guess you can believe is that they twist and lie and fabricate perpetually.
[00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:33.076]  Big report here in front of me out of the BBC today.
[00:14:34.902 --> 00:14:38.444]  And I noticed they said that modern steel buildings had never collapsed from fire.
[00:14:38.984 --> 00:14:40.325]  Shifting down to 9-11 briefly.
[00:14:41.066 --> 00:14:44.288]  I noticed that they said that modern steel buildings had never collapsed from fire.
[00:14:44.328 --> 00:14:46.510]  I mean, they can burn seven days, two days.
[00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:51.313]  They can have 100-foot, 50-foot white-hot flames, as hot as they get, shooting out.
[00:14:51.854 --> 00:14:53.094]  Metal desks don't melt.
[00:14:53.174 --> 00:14:53.895]  Nothing happens.
[00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:55.076]  No steel even weakens.
[00:14:55.959 --> 00:15:04.962]  But magically on 9-11, north of the South Tower and in Building 7 down the street, hit by nothing, has some fire start, a few small fires and collapses.
[00:15:07.002 --> 00:15:13.024]  And then the firefighters say, we've been told to get back, we're going to bring it down, and Silver Street slips up and says that they pulled it, blew it up.
[00:15:13.604 --> 00:15:19.946]  But we're supposed to just ignore all that, the CIA and NSA and FBI and Homeland Security, the precursor of that.
[00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:22.647]  Yes, you know Clinton had already set up an Office of Homeland Security in 1994.
[00:15:25.707 --> 00:15:29.930]  Go read the official list online of what was in that building.
[00:15:32.371 --> 00:15:42.497]  Well, in England, the University of Glasgow has done a test in a big skyscraper, and they've burned it with incendiaries, and of course nothing collapsed.
[00:15:43.517 --> 00:15:51.962]  And the BBC said towers never collapse, and the professors say that they couldn't believe that on 9-11 that buildings collapsed, and that they did a test, and
[00:15:53.248 --> 00:15:55.170]  But then BBC doesn't say what happened.
[00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:06.659]  So we went to Google and found another article out of the Scotsman where they did the test.
[00:16:06.859 --> 00:16:12.364]  And sure enough, they burned it with hot fires and nothing collapsed.
[00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:17.928]  But funny, the BBC was forced to report on this but wouldn't say if the building collapsed or not.
[00:16:17.968 --> 00:16:19.410]  And then I knew, of course, it didn't.
[00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.052]  And then I went and looked it up and the building, nothing collapsed.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:30.265]  And understand, the university did the test because their engineers said, there's no way buildings collapse, something's going on here.
[00:16:31.026 --> 00:16:36.210]  Those quotes are in the BBC, but then they didn't say if it collapsed or not.
[00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.411]  It makes no sense.
[00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:38.912]  It's a really weird article.
[00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:48.039]  And then we went and found a bunch, Scotsman on Sundays, one of them, about how the building did not collapse.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.403]  So I'm going to cover these after the first break.
[00:16:53.567 --> 00:16:55.809]  That we've got coming up here in just a moment.
[00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.413]  Getting back to what's happening in Israel and the surrounding areas that are being bombarded.
[00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:04.356]  Israel resumes airstrikes on Beirut.
[00:17:04.376 --> 00:17:07.518]  Again, that's the capital of Lebanon.
[00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:11.982]  Israeli arrests five, killed ten in hospital blade.
[00:17:12.743 --> 00:17:16.345]  Powerful explosions shattered the early morning peace in Beirut on Thursday.
[00:17:16.826 --> 00:17:19.308]  Airstrikes which announced the resumption of attacks.
[00:17:20.262 --> 00:17:20.983]  We're good to go.
[00:17:50.347 --> 00:17:51.127]  And it goes on.
[00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:55.490]  Some 215 rockets were fired across the Israeli-Lebanese border, the IDF reported.
[00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.771]  Which, again, you can't believe anything they say.
[00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:08.636]  One rocket landed in a Palestinian-controlled area on the northern West Bank, marking the southernmost point Hezbollah rockets have reached from southern Lebanon, Israeli sources said.
[00:18:10.197 --> 00:18:11.697]  The airstrikes are continuing.
[00:18:11.777 --> 00:18:18.901]  Israeli jets also pounded a Lebanese army position south of Sidon, killing a soldier and injuring seven others, according to the Lebanese army.
[00:18:20.524 --> 00:18:30.052]  Early Wednesday, an airstrike hit the village of Al-Jamalia as the IDF was raiding a nearby hospital in Balabek.
[00:18:30.392 --> 00:18:39.700]  The Associated Press reported a missile hit the home of Major Hussein Jamaljan, killing his son, brother, and five relatives, according to AP.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.202]  So they're killing military leaders now.
[00:18:43.503 --> 00:18:44.243]  Where is the press?
[00:18:44.283 --> 00:18:46.205]  Where is the media to see the massacre?
[00:18:47.569 --> 00:18:48.509]  Count our dead.
[00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:50.970]  Count our body parts, they told AP.
[00:18:51.010 --> 00:19:00.032]  Another mother, father, and five children were killed in another air raid near the city, and a van driver was killed when a missile struck nearby, witnesses told Associated Press.
[00:19:00.652 --> 00:19:02.912]  Hospital attack details disputed.
[00:19:02.952 --> 00:19:09.314]  Israeli's military released video Wednesday that it said proved that the Balabek Hospital was a Hezbollah headquarters.
[00:19:09.634 --> 00:19:11.054]  Hezbollah disputed the account.
[00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:14.475]  Israeli special forces captured five militants and killed ten others.
[00:19:14.955 --> 00:19:15.916]  Israeli army said.
[00:19:16.416 --> 00:19:21.778]  Hezbollah, however, said Israel arrested five civilians who were not members of the Islamic militia.
[00:19:23.459 --> 00:19:24.459]  And it goes on and on.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.620]  Oh, boy.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.861]  It's just really escalating right now.
[00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:34.223]  Mike Bush said, late July, ultimated by Iran.
[00:19:34.243 --> 00:19:36.844]  If you don't do exactly as we say, we're coming in.
[00:19:36.864 --> 00:19:42.587]  Of course, Iran knows that Saddam rolled over like a possum with his belly up for him.
[00:19:43.406 --> 00:19:45.287]  And that just encouraged an invasion.
[00:19:47.168 --> 00:19:57.772]  The globalists want weapons sales, they want domestic control, they want a smokescreen for all their other criminal activities, and the implosion of our military in Iraq, and an expansion of global war.
[00:19:57.832 --> 00:19:58.692]  We'll do that for them.
[00:19:58.712 --> 00:19:59.433]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.714 --> 00:20:03.714]  Good morning, honey.
[00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:10.117]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:20:10.437 --> 00:20:11.037]  Yeah.
[00:20:11.437 --> 00:20:12.798]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:20:13.228 --> 00:20:16.669]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel Berkey system.
[00:20:17.129 --> 00:20:18.629]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.830]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.011]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:24.151]  Honey, cheer up.
[00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:26.792]  I brought our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[00:20:27.072 --> 00:20:27.392]  What?
[00:20:27.832 --> 00:20:35.154]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water.
[00:20:35.414 --> 00:20:38.435]  So I packed our Sport Berkey purifiers.
[00:20:38.735 --> 00:20:38.995]  You know...
[00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.911]  This is a terrific cabin!
[00:20:41.151 --> 00:20:41.932]  And wow!
[00:20:42.192 --> 00:20:43.652]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[00:20:44.092 --> 00:20:45.272]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:20:49.113 --> 00:20:50.414]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.236 --> 00:21:01.697]  Gold.
[00:21:02.037 --> 00:21:03.318]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.578 --> 00:21:09.664]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.844 --> 00:21:13.667]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:14.027 --> 00:21:15.909]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.949 --> 00:21:18.251]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.411 --> 00:21:25.037]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weak
[00:21:25.077 --> 00:21:25.757]  We're good to go.
[00:21:43.387 --> 00:21:44.608]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:44.628 --> 00:21:48.972]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence?
[00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.233]  We stated that we must bring about a New World Order.
[00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:17.997]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:23.443]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[00:22:24.244 --> 00:22:32.892]  This is the same New World Order called for by former President George Herbert Walker Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War in 1990-1991.
[00:22:35.434 --> 00:22:43.197]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:45.278]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:45.298 --> 00:22:45.758]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:45.818 --> 00:22:46.138]  Call now.

[00:23:00.624 --> 00:23:05.905]  Dry cracked heels used to be a real problem for me, especially in the summer when I wear sandals.
[00:23:06.165 --> 00:23:08.765]  My husband would say, your heels are like sandpaper.
[00:23:09.185 --> 00:23:11.746]  But then my podiatrist gave me Calix Ointment.
[00:23:12.106 --> 00:23:17.087]  It's diabetic friendly and smooths cracked heels and calluses using natural enzymes.
[00:23:17.327 --> 00:23:20.847]  Calix never stings or burns and made my heels baby soft.
[00:23:21.168 --> 00:23:22.728]  Now they look and feel great.
[00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:26.548]  If you have calluses or dry cracked heels, try Calix Ointment.
[00:23:26.868 --> 00:23:29.769]  You can find it at Walgreens and Longs in the foot care section.
[00:23:31.246 --> 00:23:33.727]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:23:34.188 --> 00:23:36.089]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:23:36.809 --> 00:23:39.991]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:47.114]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[00:23:50.956 --> 00:23:52.377]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:13.014]  A strange article from the BBC headline today.
[00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:15.996]  This is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:24:16.736 --> 00:24:19.518]  Tower block fire.
[00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:22.300]  AIDS 911 debate.
[00:24:23.981 --> 00:24:24.662]  BBC.
[00:24:24.862 --> 00:24:34.769]  A high-rise block in Glasgow has been set alight in an attempt to understand how blazes affect buildings and ensure future safety in emergencies.
[00:24:35.402 --> 00:24:47.572]  Jose Torero, professor of fire safety engineering at the University of Edinburgh, conducted the experiment on a 24-story tower block in Dalmarnock.
[00:24:48.993 --> 00:24:53.556]  He also hopes it will shed light on why the twin towers collapsed on 9-11.
[00:24:54.657 --> 00:25:02.263]  Professor Torero said he believed the World Trade Centers in New York should have withstood burnout after it was hit.
[00:25:02.784 --> 00:25:04.325]  Again, should have withstood burnout.
[00:25:04.952 --> 00:25:15.214]  The collapse of the Twin Towers in 2001 after they were hit by a hijacked aircraft resulted in the deaths of almost 2,800 workers and 350 firefighters and emergency workers.
[00:25:15.274 --> 00:25:19.855]  Professor Torero said, it didn't even cross my mind that buildings would collapse.
[00:25:20.695 --> 00:25:24.295]  From my perspective, those buildings were designed to last structurally.
[00:25:24.995 --> 00:25:25.556]  And it goes on.
[00:25:25.576 --> 00:25:29.496]  The experiment took place in the block flats of Milford Place and Allen Street.
[00:25:30.016 --> 00:25:33.737]  And it goes on to how they put sensors in and rigged incendiaries and
[00:25:35.675 --> 00:25:38.936]  Then it goes on and doesn't tell you if the building collapsed.
[00:25:40.056 --> 00:25:45.457]  And then I found other articles that didn't tell you if the building collapsed, that just had his quotes about how it shouldn't collapse.
[00:25:46.157 --> 00:26:00.040]  And then I found Firefighter News, firefightingnews.com, and sure enough, it reports that day after day, they burned different areas of the buildings over and over again.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.741]  They'd open windows, they'd open doors, they would...
[00:26:03.514 --> 00:26:05.335]  You know, try to make it collapse, and it didn't.
[00:26:05.495 --> 00:26:12.317]  Now, I'm told that the testing is still ongoing, and the stories I've got go back a few weeks ago when the testing was still going.
[00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:14.738]  This could all be a setup.
[00:26:15.298 --> 00:26:19.960]  They could continue doing tests and then claim that with a certain configuration it does collapse.
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:27.042]  That is not the case unless they've gone in sneakily and cut pillars.
[00:26:27.482 --> 00:26:32.544]  Building 7 collapsing is hurting the establishment so bad right now
[00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:42.303]  That back last year when the Madrid building was burning, about eight, nine hours into it, I remember CNN going, well, it's going to collapse.
[00:26:42.343 --> 00:26:44.264]  These fires are much bigger than 9-11.
[00:26:44.924 --> 00:26:45.845]  And then nothing collapsed.
[00:26:45.905 --> 00:26:46.785]  I mean, huge.
[00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:49.046]  Hundred foot flames.
[00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:52.868]  We know that because there would be flames shooting out of the lower sections.
[00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:54.954]  I say 100-foot flames.
[00:26:54.994 --> 00:27:02.156]  It was a 50-story building, and there were flames that were continuously shooting up for 20, 30 stories.
[00:27:02.337 --> 00:27:03.257]  I mean, continuous.
[00:27:03.737 --> 00:27:07.278]  And then off the top, you could measure it, and it looked like about five, six more stories.
[00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:16.742]  I mean, it looked like a huge torch burning on all sides because they were renovating the building.
[00:27:16.962 --> 00:27:18.583]  They had the windows out of it.
[00:27:19.944 --> 00:27:26.628]  Out of many of the stories, because they were putting new glass in, which did help the fire burn that much hotter.
[00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:31.571]  Because it basically allowed oxygen to get in.
[00:27:31.671 --> 00:27:38.015]  And flute, or what's that term they use for injecting oxygen into a fire?
[00:27:38.696 --> 00:27:40.517]  And so it's burning like a torch.
[00:27:40.577 --> 00:27:47.321]  But then you see in the hottest areas, once the fire had burned out, after almost two days, you see aluminum deaths.
[00:27:48.053 --> 00:27:48.473]  We're good to go.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.701]  And that's because modern steel buildings never have and never will collapse.
[00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:22.521]  This is known.
[00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:41.724]  Underwriting laboratories that underwrites every major structure in the country and that certifies all of your safety equipment, your life jackets, you'll see their seal on it, on Coast Guard approved life jackets, you'll see it on all of the government approved and certified fire extinguishers, UL.
[00:28:43.425 --> 00:28:44.385]  Underwriter laboratories.
[00:28:45.094 --> 00:28:51.456]  And one of their chief engineers, and he was the chief engineer on the project to do internal tests on models.
[00:28:52.036 --> 00:28:58.259]  They built models with temperatures many times hotter than 9-11 and nothing even weakened.
[00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:00.119]  He writes an internal report.
[00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:01.200]  They tell him, shut up.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:09.002]  He releases part of it, and they fire him so fast it makes your head spin, and now he's suing them.
[00:29:09.883 --> 00:29:10.363]  Kevin Ryan.
[00:29:11.787 --> 00:29:20.534]  So, and a bunch of mining college heads and others went public in the first few weeks after, but then got their federal funds threatened, so they all just shut up or recanted.
[00:29:22.055 --> 00:29:25.598]  Then they tried to claim the buildings weren't built right and didn't have any central columns.
[00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:28.861]  And then you go look at the actual plans, it had some of the biggest columns ever.
[00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:30.722]  47 of them in each building.
[00:29:33.284 --> 00:29:36.607]  And then the 9-11 Commission says that there were no columns in the center.
[00:29:36.647 --> 00:29:37.508]  I mean, that's like saying...
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.801]  The sun isn't hot.
[00:29:40.901 --> 00:29:43.102]  I mean, it just... Water isn't wet.
[00:29:43.142 --> 00:29:46.064]  It's like saying, I don't have a nose or breathe oxygen.
[00:29:46.104 --> 00:29:48.105]  It's just... It's ridiculous.
[00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:52.888]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.348 --> 00:29:54.969]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:30:31.818 --> 00:30:34.680]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.320]  A tornado under your hood!
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:42.283]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[00:30:42.624 --> 00:30:49.767]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[00:30:49.907 --> 00:30:54.730]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[00:30:54.930 --> 00:31:00.133]  Visit TornadoAir.com or go to Pep Boys, Napa, or AutoZone today.
[00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:02.735]  We're good to go.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:35.568]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.688 --> 00:31:44.576]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:48.138]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:06.689]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:32:06.749 --> 00:32:07.470]  have diabetes.
[00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:14.752]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:32:14.892 --> 00:32:19.433]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:22.454]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:33:02.499 --> 00:33:07.625]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.326 --> 00:33:10.709]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.533]  Alright, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:33:21.864 --> 00:33:29.670]  Interceptor pilot, 101 combat missions over to Vietnam, former head of the Star Wars program, the Directed Energy Program and Missile Defense Program.
[00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:32.772]  He's going to be joining us here in just a minute or two into the next hour.
[00:33:33.213 --> 00:33:39.477]  Paul Watson joins us for a global news report on a whole plethora of issues in the third hour today.
[00:33:39.497 --> 00:33:42.480]  And yes, coming up in the next hour, we will have some open phones.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:43.861]  I want to play just a few of the clips.
[00:33:43.901 --> 00:33:47.683]  We can't play, obviously, the whole thing with Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:51.186]  Coming up in a few minutes, the new NORAD release, Select Mobile.
[00:33:51.866 --> 00:33:52.647]  We're good to go.
[00:34:12.196 --> 00:34:12.896]  We're good to go.
[00:34:12.936 --> 00:34:13.116]  I think?
[00:34:36.315 --> 00:34:42.844]  And from there we get into the latest developments on 9-11, the 7-7 bombing being an inside job.
[00:34:43.224 --> 00:34:44.787]  We also cover the Madrid bombing.
[00:34:45.147 --> 00:34:46.449]  We interview Ray McGovern.
[00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:50.194]  We interview two MI5 agents, David Shaler and Andy Michon.
[00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:52.437]  We interview Professor Stephen Jones.
[00:34:52.817 --> 00:34:53.338]  We're good to go.
[00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:32.884]  Terror Storm is available right now on the secure video and online bookstore at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:33.205 --> 00:35:43.495]  And when you call, be sure and ask about all the different specials, because when you get three or more of any of my documentary films, American Dictators, Order of Death, Martial Law, Terror Storm...
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:44.861]  We're good to go.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.881]  We're good to go.
[00:36:02.901 --> 00:36:03.061]  I think?
[00:36:28.777 --> 00:36:39.740]  And then last but not least, you can also go to prisonplanet.tv, download and watch all 15 of my films, an incredibly high quality online video.
[00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:41.069]  We're good to go.
[00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.250]  I think?
[00:37:02.287 --> 00:37:03.109]  I think we're good to go.
[00:37:13.211 --> 00:37:17.736]  I'm going to be having a premiere of Terror Storm in Dallas on the 26th of this month.
[00:37:17.796 --> 00:37:18.798]  That's a Saturday.
[00:37:19.398 --> 00:37:21.060]  And Jim Mars will give a speech.
[00:37:21.881 --> 00:37:23.203]  The New World Order expert.
[00:37:23.263 --> 00:37:26.166]  The fellow that wrote the JFK screenplay and the book it's based on.
[00:37:26.546 --> 00:37:27.768]  From JFK to 9-11.
[00:37:28.509 --> 00:37:29.950]  He's got a new book coming out on 9-11.
[00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:31.252]  He's going to give an hour speech.
[00:37:31.572 --> 00:37:32.874]  And I'm going to show 35 minutes.
[00:37:33.695 --> 00:37:34.276]  We're good to go.
[00:37:34.296 --> 00:37:35.156]  We're good to go.
[00:38:01.866 --> 00:38:10.796]  Funny thing is I'm looking at a picture of the young Dr. Bob Bowman, former director of the Star Wars Defense Program under Presidents Ford and Carter, and he looks like Billy Graham.
[00:38:11.477 --> 00:38:17.244]  In fact, he looked a little bit like Billy Graham now when I'm seeing him in person, but have you ever been told, Dr. Bowman, you look like Billy Graham?
[00:38:18.005 --> 00:38:18.445]  No.
[00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:20.608]  I've been told I look like
[00:38:21.255 --> 00:38:24.257]  Ted Kennedy, a lot of different people, but never Billy Graham.
[00:38:25.357 --> 00:38:33.622]  Well, you ought to look at him, especially with those sideburns you're sporting in this picture, and you look just like the young Billy Graham, or I guess he looks like you.
[00:38:33.882 --> 00:38:49.791]  Dr. Bowman, for those that don't know who you are, tell us a little bit about yourself before we get into this whole situation with what's happening with the release of select NORAD excerpts, and then let's get into why you think they're releasing these right now.
[00:38:50.882 --> 00:38:51.122]  Right.
[00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:59.549]  Well, I'm a career military officer with, as you said, a PhD in aeronautics and nuclear engineering from Caltech.
[00:39:01.351 --> 00:39:10.438]  I flew 101 combat missions in Vietnam, was a professor at the Air Force Institute of Technology and several other universities.
[00:39:10.458 --> 00:39:16.863]  I've spoken all over the world, chaired eight major international conferences.
[00:39:18.618 --> 00:39:32.208]  But for the last 25 years, I've essentially been a full-time troublemaker and whistleblower, a watchdog for the American people exposing the lies and deceit of their government.
[00:39:32.668 --> 00:39:34.930]  So that's really my full-time job right now.
[00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:44.737]  Well, Dr. Bowman, one more question before we get into the meat and potatoes for the next 45 minutes to an hour with you on the NORAD tapes and, again, why those have been released, I believe, is...
[00:39:45.097 --> 00:39:45.618]  The conference in L.A.
[00:39:45.658 --> 00:39:46.158]  was fantastic.
[00:40:12.361 --> 00:40:20.364]  I've been a keynote speaker at five of the 9-11 truth conferences, and this was by far the best.
[00:40:22.865 --> 00:40:25.426]  For the C-SPAN, that was a real coup.
[00:40:25.886 --> 00:40:33.709]  I don't know how you pulled off getting C-SPAN to videotape that panel discussion and then air it, but...
[00:40:35.848 --> 00:40:37.549]  It was really great.
[00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:47.631]  I have had so many people become converts to the 9-11 Truth Movement because of that C-SPAN broadcast.
[00:40:47.931 --> 00:40:53.153]  And it's also generated a lot of interest in your congressional campaign and gotten you on a lot of other radio shows.
[00:40:54.093 --> 00:40:54.953]  It has indeed.
[00:40:55.654 --> 00:40:58.214]  It has done that.
[00:40:58.554 --> 00:41:03.996]  In addition, I not only spent 90 minutes on the radio yesterday, but...
[00:41:05.373 --> 00:41:09.917]  I spent an hour talking with a reporter from U.S.
[00:41:09.997 --> 00:41:11.198]  News and World Report.
[00:41:11.718 --> 00:41:20.224]  It seems they're doing an article on the 9-11 truth movement for their 9-11 5th anniversary special issue.
[00:41:22.086 --> 00:41:23.407]  Massive attention.
[00:41:23.887 --> 00:41:27.170]  Really, the credit goes to Kevin Smith, who works here in the office.
[00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.312]  He had the idea to call C-SPAN, and I said, man, don't hold your breath.
[00:41:30.899 --> 00:41:35.380]  We've been calling them for years to come to events, and sure enough, they said they were going to come and cover it.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:41.822]  Then they normally air panel discussions for American Perspectives on C-SPAN 1 within a week to two weeks.
[00:41:42.402 --> 00:41:46.463]  We started getting really concerned when it hadn't aired in four weeks, and we put pressure on them.
[00:41:46.723 --> 00:41:50.424]  I don't know if that's what had the effect, but they did air it, and aired it four times.
[00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:50.964]  Yeah.
[00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:52.825]  Just amazing.
[00:41:53.825 --> 00:41:56.246]  Really, the worm is turning, as they say, though.
[00:41:56.346 --> 00:41:57.226]  Everybody out there...
[00:41:58.064 --> 00:41:59.245]  It's starting to wake up the 9-11.
[00:41:59.705 --> 00:42:04.206]  Shifting gears back into the NORAD, select NORAD tapes released.
[00:42:04.327 --> 00:42:05.627]  Why do you think this is happening?
[00:42:05.647 --> 00:42:18.092]  Why do you think the 9-11 Commission, which actively covered up and obstructed the truth, actively appointed by Bush, is now trying to talk about how they almost charged people criminally with the Inspector General.
[00:42:18.112 --> 00:42:22.914]  They're now trying to claim that there was a Pentagon cover-up of malfeasance and idiocy
[00:42:23.954 --> 00:42:26.235]  I mean, this is the classic, in my opinion, fallback.
[00:42:26.455 --> 00:42:33.798]  When criminals get caught red-handed in something, they then try to claim that it was simply the fact that they were morons.
[00:42:34.438 --> 00:42:35.458]  Well, absolutely.
[00:42:36.498 --> 00:42:46.462]  You know very well that I've been saying for years that if this was incompetence, why was nobody punished?
[00:42:46.622 --> 00:42:48.062]  Why was nobody court-martialed?
[00:42:48.182 --> 00:42:49.483]  Why was nobody demoted?
[00:42:50.623 --> 00:42:51.804]  Why was nobody fired?
[00:42:52.664 --> 00:42:52.764]  And
[00:42:53.397 --> 00:43:06.528]  I think this kind of criticism that I'm sure is coming from a lot of different folks is finally getting to them, and they're figuring, well, we have to feed somebody to the lions.
[00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:09.070]  I guess this is it.
[00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:12.753]  Well, give us that one-liner about you're an old interceptor pilot.
[00:43:13.033 --> 00:43:15.775]  If they would have done nothing, all those planes would have been shot down.
[00:43:15.816 --> 00:43:16.536]  Give us that line.
[00:43:17.237 --> 00:43:17.437]  Well...
[00:43:18.519 --> 00:43:30.408]  If our government had done nothing and had allowed normal procedures to be followed that morning, the Twin Towers would still be standing and thousands of dead Americans would still be alive.
[00:43:31.789 --> 00:43:34.571]  Explain that for people that haven't been an interceptor pilot.
[00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:35.692]  Explain what you mean by that.
[00:43:37.293 --> 00:43:39.595]  Well, if normal procedures had been followed...
[00:43:40.934 --> 00:44:09.055]  And if there had not been all of those odd, strangely manufactured exercises going on that I believe were deliberately conducted in order to confuse everybody, if just had been a normal day and normal procedures had been followed, those aircraft would have been intercepted long before they reached the World Trade Center.
[00:44:10.129 --> 00:44:17.655]  To say nothing of the plane that hit the Pentagon that should have been intercepted probably 100 miles away.
[00:44:19.376 --> 00:44:23.719]  Now, you've had a chance, I know, to hear the tapes, some of the tapes now.
[00:44:24.519 --> 00:44:27.722]  And I want to play some of them later, just a few of the clips.
[00:44:27.782 --> 00:44:30.324]  But over and over again, they keep saying, is this real world?
[00:44:30.404 --> 00:44:32.205]  Is this part of the exercises?
[00:44:32.565 --> 00:44:34.226]  And they keep saying, look at all these blips.
[00:44:34.266 --> 00:44:36.088]  They're confused by all the superimposed.
[00:44:36.868 --> 00:44:42.253]  Fake hijacking blips, and then they keep talking about, you know, why haven't they scrambled fighters?
[00:44:42.313 --> 00:44:43.434]  Why haven't they authorized this?
[00:44:43.494 --> 00:44:45.476]  Why don't they have fighters up there?
[00:44:45.496 --> 00:45:01.550]  And then we hear a bunch of other chilling discussions as they're begging for help, and then one person at NORAD, you hear him talking about how he wants to strangle people in the military because they're not responding to their calls.
[00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.132]  Then we hear military voices calmly saying,
[00:45:04.432 --> 00:45:07.873]  Well, it means that the lower-level people who were taped were truly confused.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:40.423]  Now, you have to understand that that tape was not of NORAD.
[00:45:40.823 --> 00:45:45.084]  It was not a tape of what was going on in Cheyenne Mountain.
[00:45:45.304 --> 00:45:50.687]  This was a tape of NEADS, the Northeast Air Defense Sector.
[00:45:51.227 --> 00:45:54.228]  And the ranking guy there was a major.
[00:45:55.048 --> 00:45:59.250]  And the people who were actually in there, the...
[00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:06.288]  The ranking person who was involved in most of those conversations was a Master Sergeant.
[00:46:07.889 --> 00:46:13.733]  So you have to understand that there are no tapes that have been released of
[00:46:17.702 --> 00:46:18.923]  This is huge.
[00:46:18.963 --> 00:46:21.365]  So what you're really saying is it's another media hoax.
[00:46:21.625 --> 00:46:27.269]  They're calling this full disclosure, when in reality they haven't released the high-level communications.
[00:46:27.289 --> 00:46:34.874]  They've released, as I was talking about yesterday, folks, some of the confused discussions between different military branches, one of the coordinating groups.
[00:46:35.434 --> 00:46:37.775]  And some of the FAA.
[00:46:38.435 --> 00:46:40.196]  So this is all the chatter.
[00:46:40.216 --> 00:46:49.400]  They have selectively decided to release just some confusing sounding chatter, and they're not releasing all of the other high-level discussions.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.540]  This is very suspicious.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:58.463]  They released 30% of the tapes that were taped at the Northeast Air Defense Sector.
[00:46:59.343 --> 00:47:00.764]  They released none.
[00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:05.444]  Of anything that was taped at Cheyenne Mountain.
[00:47:07.705 --> 00:47:09.026]  That needs to be released, doesn't it?
[00:47:10.027 --> 00:47:10.748]  I would think so.
[00:47:12.189 --> 00:47:20.355]  So, they're now talking about how they discuss criminally going after some of these low-level people when they're actually there trying to do their job begging for help.
[00:47:22.137 --> 00:47:23.158]  That's the way it looks to me.
[00:47:23.438 --> 00:47:30.644]  Now, I must say that there were higher-level people who testified to the
[00:47:31.405 --> 00:47:38.668]  Keen Hamilton Commission and testified, it appears, falsely.
[00:47:38.688 --> 00:47:44.970]  And going after them is probably a good idea.
[00:47:46.071 --> 00:47:56.435]  They're not going after the Master Sergeant Marine, who was in there saying, cool.
[00:47:58.467 --> 00:47:59.127]  This is amazing.
[00:47:59.147 --> 00:47:59.187]  So...
[00:48:19.043 --> 00:48:20.884]  You've worked inside government at the highest levels.
[00:48:21.584 --> 00:48:34.388]  What do you think the overall, I mean in more detail, we know this is all a big distraction, but it seems like every distraction they bring out, some new fuzzy Pentagon tape from the parking lot or these new tapes, it seems to really only incriminate them more.
[00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:47.072]  Well, it certainly does in our eyes, but you must look at it from the perspective of somebody in the public that knows absolutely nothing.
[00:48:47.908 --> 00:49:10.582]  And they're going to think, oh, well, they've released all this stuff, and they might actually believe that the 9-11 truth movement has been defused and shown to be a bunch of kooks, which is the furthest thing from the truth, because what they have released...
[00:49:12.035 --> 00:49:18.556]  In my estimation, only makes our case stronger that there is something totally fishy about the government story.
[00:49:20.797 --> 00:49:26.258]  Dr. Bob Bowman, former Interceptor pilot, you've worked this detail.
[00:49:28.458 --> 00:49:30.998]  What really should have happened on 9-11?
[00:49:31.598 --> 00:49:35.499]  What should have happened if normal default settings were left in place?
[00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:39.940]  What should have happened is that...
[00:49:41.963 --> 00:49:50.705]  Boston Center, FAA Air Traffic Control, would have called Needs and said, we have a problem.
[00:49:53.565 --> 00:49:56.606]  We have an airplane that appears to be hijacked.
[00:49:57.566 --> 00:50:03.627]  And in my estimation, the guys at Needs would say, yeah, we've been advised of that.
[00:50:03.787 --> 00:50:07.107]  NORAD sees that too, and they've already alerted us.
[00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:10.568]  And we have already called
[00:50:11.577 --> 00:50:13.400]  For interceptors to be scrambled.
[00:50:14.522 --> 00:50:22.593]  And there would have been interceptors up there alongside those aircraft.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:23.820]  Yeah.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:24.000]  Yeah.
[00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:50.280]  I mean, come on, people!
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:57.264]  And now they will have you believe it's a bunch of bumbling people at low level off in the corner somewhere.
[00:50:58.325 --> 00:50:59.565]  We'll be right back with Dr. Bob Bummel.
[00:50:59.585 --> 00:51:00.626]  We'll play some of these clips.
[00:51:00.726 --> 00:51:07.930]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.211]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:10.572 --> 00:51:18.176]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.908 --> 00:51:25.952]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.352 --> 00:51:37.839]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:41.581]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.061 --> 00:51:44.003]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.323 --> 00:51:48.145]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:56.469 --> 00:54:06.116]  Alright, Dr. Bob Bowman is our guest.
[00:54:12.302 --> 00:54:16.364]  They know that the general public isn't focused on geopolitical activities.
[00:54:16.504 --> 00:54:18.765]  Again, doesn't even know the basic regions of the planet.
[00:54:18.805 --> 00:54:20.846]  Doesn't know how many continents there are.
[00:54:20.866 --> 00:54:24.088]  And I mean, I'm not even being elitist here.
[00:54:24.148 --> 00:54:25.108]  I'm just an average person.
[00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.369]  I don't even think I'm that smart.
[00:54:26.849 --> 00:54:28.390]  And all this stuff is pretty obvious.
[00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:30.331]  People don't know the history of the Middle East.
[00:54:30.371 --> 00:54:32.532]  They don't know the basics of our three branches of government.
[00:54:32.972 --> 00:54:36.654]  Most Americans don't even know who their state rep is or who their congressman or woman is.
[00:54:37.558 --> 00:54:40.540]  They don't even know how NORAD operates or the basics of it.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.981]  I mean, I've been studying it.
[00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:42.862]  It's pretty complex.
[00:54:42.942 --> 00:54:44.022]  I don't even know all the details.
[00:54:44.423 --> 00:54:48.365]  Bob Bowman has helped head up these type of programs, and he doesn't even know all the details.
[00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.726]  I mean, things are so complex, but we know this.
[00:54:51.067 --> 00:54:52.688]  The official story is a fraud.
[00:54:53.208 --> 00:55:00.232]  And so a person who's educated on this hears these tapes and goes, well, this just proves even more culpability and involvement by criminal elements.
[00:55:00.572 --> 00:55:04.614]  But for the general public, they'll just hear hijackers, hijackers, and, huh, huh, where is it?
[00:55:04.654 --> 00:55:06.335]  Well, it just disappeared again.
[00:55:06.395 --> 00:55:10.157]  Well, you know, put a missile in his face.
[00:55:11.078 --> 00:55:15.260]  Bob Bowman, there's also clips in these tapes that we played yesterday.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.901]  We'll play some later if we have time.
[00:55:18.302 --> 00:55:18.602]  Where...
[00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:22.731]  They're talking about, okay, we got him, we got him.
[00:55:23.171 --> 00:55:23.972]  Okay, we're on him.
[00:55:24.032 --> 00:55:25.252]  Okay, we just took him down.
[00:55:25.272 --> 00:55:31.195]  I mean, there's a bunch of clips that sound like they've just shot down airplanes, and you can't tell.
[00:55:31.215 --> 00:55:33.016]  It sounds like it could be Pentagon.
[00:55:33.416 --> 00:55:36.277]  It sounds like it could be Pennsylvania.
[00:55:37.418 --> 00:55:38.458]  You've listened to these tapes.
[00:55:38.518 --> 00:55:39.638]  You know what you're hearing.
[00:55:40.199 --> 00:55:41.039]  What do you get from this?
[00:55:43.929 --> 00:55:47.011]  I don't think there's anything conclusive on there.
[00:55:47.131 --> 00:55:49.593]  I don't think you can tell exactly what's going on.
[00:55:50.193 --> 00:55:56.157]  And I don't think most of the people whose voices you hear on the tape, I don't think they knew what was going on either.
[00:55:59.039 --> 00:56:05.883]  So, you know, we really don't know what happened.
[00:56:05.923 --> 00:56:08.265]  There is a great deal of suspicion that...
[00:56:10.377 --> 00:56:18.382]  Flight 93 was actually shot down, but on the other hand, the tapes talk about there being a bomb on Flight 93.
[00:56:19.323 --> 00:56:22.265]  And that's another possible scenario.
[00:56:24.146 --> 00:56:36.353]  It also, the great confusion of needs, the controllers there at the Northeast Air Defense Sector, they didn't even know that...
[00:56:39.718 --> 00:56:41.220]  Flight 93 was down.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:46.103]  And then when they were told it was down, they said, oh, where did it land?
[00:56:46.304 --> 00:56:48.726]  And they said, no, no, it didn't land.
[00:56:48.786 --> 00:56:50.667]  It's down, down, you know.
[00:56:51.148 --> 00:56:58.353]  So I don't think the tapes prove that somebody shot down 93.
[00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:06.039]  But, you know, there's just all sorts of tantalizing bits which...
[00:57:09.881 --> 00:57:13.466]  We are part of the whole, and we don't have the rest.
[00:57:15.071 --> 00:57:18.092]  We need to get the rest, and they haven't given us the rest.
[00:57:18.392 --> 00:57:28.376]  Well, doesn't this whole thing, I mean, not just the drills and Cheney in control and the order still stands with Norman Mineta witnessing all of this, Transportation Secretary, this fits the classic M.O.
[00:57:28.416 --> 00:57:39.920]  of an intelligence operation where they create all these decoys, all this confusion, all of this fog of war, to where in hindsight, I mean, you know the official stories of fraud, but it's hard to find out really what's going on.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.321]  Absolutely.
[00:57:42.944 --> 00:58:00.027]  Let me lay out the top-level scenario here, because we know that the neocons in control of the Bush administration wanted war with Iraq.
[00:58:00.867 --> 00:58:08.529]  They wanted war with Afghanistan long before 9-11, as a matter of fact, before they even got in office.
[00:58:10.157 --> 00:58:17.702]  We know that preparations for the attack on Afghanistan had been made before 9-11.
[00:58:21.044 --> 00:58:22.485]  There are three possibilities.
[00:58:23.085 --> 00:58:25.767]  Either... Stay there, Dr. Bob Bowman.
[00:58:25.787 --> 00:58:26.387]  We've got a break.
[00:58:26.828 --> 00:58:28.129]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:28.169 --> 00:58:32.291]  Go through your three possibilities, your three views on this.
[00:58:32.311 --> 00:58:34.873]  And we'll play a few clips of the tapes.
[00:58:35.653 --> 00:58:38.916]  And take your phone calls for Dr. Bob Bowman on the other side.
[00:58:38.976 --> 00:58:39.316]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.835 --> 00:58:46.858]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:47.138 --> 00:59:02.446]  Nothing this fun, but it is super fun to say the least to try to do this.
[00:59:03.667 --> 00:59:05.168]  Genesis is a little bit different of the network, too.
[00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.009]  You've got to remember, our hosts are all over the country.
[00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:10.991]  They're not in big official radio stations, and we hook all into the network up in...
[00:59:12.228 --> 00:59:14.889]  Up in Minnesota.
[00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:18.311]  Think about the risk we all take.
[00:59:18.331 --> 00:59:21.012]  Think about the things we do to bring you these broadcasts.
[00:59:21.213 --> 00:59:21.933]  It's not easy.
[00:59:22.753 --> 00:59:23.814]  It's not inexpensive.
[00:59:24.834 --> 00:59:37.841]  And we're all in a lot of risk to ourselves to stand up against the New World Order, to stand up against the Global Crime Syndicate, and to expose what the establishment is doing.
[00:59:39.773 --> 01:00:01.059]  And really our biggest problem as a society is that people are naive, they're simple, they're uninformed about the world around them, and the average person cannot imagine balancing their own checkbook or keeping their children off of drugs or even keeping their head above water.
[01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:02.619]  They're in so much credit card debt.
[01:00:04.061 --> 01:00:26.616]  Just trying to survive and keep up appearances and have enough baubles dangling from their clothing to act cool and stylish to even be able to imagine that there are criminals that openly put, as I keep mentioning, Bayer admits, knowingly putting HIV and hepatitis C in the blood supply and in the drug supply of millions, killing hundreds of thousands here in the U.S.
[01:00:26.676 --> 01:00:26.936]  alone.
[01:00:27.862 --> 01:00:38.351]  That's all admitted publicly now, as is hundreds of other similar examples of corporations and governments, just totally ruthlessly, with pleasure, killing innocent people.
[01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:49.640]  Doesn't matter if it's declassified that our government's released radiological, chemical, and biological agents thousands of times against the American people.
[01:00:51.461 --> 01:00:56.285]  Doesn't matter if they've knowingly killed our innocent troops, knowing they would die when they were nerve-gassed in tests.
[01:00:57.917 --> 01:01:03.922]  Or the atomic soldiers or atomic children, they'd tell families, oh, we're going to x-ray your child here at the military base.
[01:01:04.302 --> 01:01:05.283]  You get free health care.
[01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:09.226]  They'd really radiate the child and kill him on purpose just to study it.
[01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:13.429]  And so this is what we face.
[01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.371]  This is the real world here.
[01:01:17.593 --> 01:01:19.634]  And I'm aware of it.
[01:01:19.654 --> 01:01:22.897]  People say, well, you focus too much on the macabre or the negative.
[01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:23.057]  Hey.
[01:01:23.729 --> 01:01:32.732]  It's actually positive that we're on air, we're exposing this, we're talking about it, we're involved in society resisting this tyranny.
[01:01:34.672 --> 01:01:38.213]  That is very, very positive and healthy and good.
[01:01:38.854 --> 01:01:46.956]  What is unhealthy is denying all this is going on and just going on about your daily business like everything is going to be okay when it's not going to be okay.
[01:01:47.907 --> 01:01:53.474]  The big threat we face is the global government openly says they want to exterminate 85-95% of us.
[01:01:53.995 --> 01:01:58.361]  They want to build a, quote, police state so they can exterminate us in a more orderly fashion.
[01:01:58.721 --> 01:02:02.306]  Now, I've been saying that on air for really 12 years since I got on air.
[01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:23.840]  And it's now been demonstrated, and every time a new document or declassified report comes out, or every time some top professor spouts off at an official gathering, and 95% of the people stand up and give them a round of applause, standing ovations, when they say, China's great, they have a police state to reduce population.
[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.161]  A police state is there to treat you like cattle.
[01:02:28.461 --> 01:02:30.542]  Paul Watson, sorry about this rollercoaster today.
[01:02:30.562 --> 01:02:33.363]  I'll probably get you back up next week again when...
[01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:41.309]  When stuff isn't swinging from the chandeliers over there at the network with one poor guy with everything melting down around him.
[01:02:41.989 --> 01:02:46.993]  But we're about to go to calls when you got cut off, but we won't take any now.
[01:02:47.533 --> 01:02:48.654]  Just I'm tired of dealing with it.
[01:02:49.014 --> 01:02:49.615]  Sorry, folks.
[01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:51.196]  The phone system keeps flipping out.
[01:02:52.777 --> 01:02:57.921]  Equipment doesn't do well when it just is turned off because batteries weren't properly charged.
[01:02:59.057 --> 01:03:00.097]  But we are on generators.
[01:03:00.157 --> 01:03:01.418]  None of it really matters anyways.
[01:03:02.258 --> 01:03:18.523]  But, Paul, you were making a point about the wild, vitriolic, genocidal statements of the Israelis, which, if they were being carried out by anyone else, would be decried for what they actually are.
[01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:19.304]  Go ahead.
[01:03:20.784 --> 01:03:26.726]  Well, yeah, and it's not that they're just saying, and the cheerleaders of this war are just saying, well,
[01:03:27.682 --> 01:03:30.224]  Charred and mangled babies are the cost of war.
[01:03:30.425 --> 01:03:32.867]  You know, there's going to be innocent deaths in warfare.
[01:03:32.987 --> 01:03:35.249]  Or it's all an accident and, oh, it's too bad.
[01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:38.292]  No, now they're just going, yeah, we love it, it's great.
[01:03:38.712 --> 01:03:39.813]  It's one step beyond.
[01:03:39.834 --> 01:03:46.880]  And you said, before I got cut off, that there's some of these people there, there's no such thing as innocent people.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.844]  This is exactly what this person said to us, which we created the article from.
[01:03:51.693 --> 01:03:55.317]  Quote, as far as innocent people are concerned, there's no such thing.
[01:03:55.838 --> 01:04:03.888]  Someone who lives in and grew up in Beirut, as my ex-fiancee did, knows they are living in what has been an urban combat zone for decades.
[01:04:04.355 --> 01:04:11.737]  The fact that many of them don't pack up and leave, it tells a lot of things, among which is the fact that they accept that they live in a combat zone.
[01:04:11.777 --> 01:04:27.461]  So they're saying they need to go ahead and leave and let Israel have the land, and they're saying a lot of them don't have the money, of course, to leave or can't find a country to go to, and a lot of them are already driven out of Palestine, south of there, and the West Bank before.
[01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:37.165]  And then, of course, he goes on to talk about how it's good that the Romans would come in and kill everyone in a city, or 10%, hence the term decimation or decimal.
[01:04:37.906 --> 01:04:39.987]  I mean, he goes on to laud it.
[01:04:40.107 --> 01:04:40.807]  I'm sorry, go ahead, Paul.
[01:04:42.048 --> 01:04:46.270]  Yeah, and even beyond that, when they try to leave, their vehicles are targeted anyway.
[01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:53.853]  But then, you know, these mangled and burned babies deserve to be killed because they knew what they were letting themselves in for.
[01:04:54.313 --> 01:04:55.494]  Is that fair to say?
[01:04:56.744 --> 01:05:02.392]  And then, as I mentioned earlier, some of them try to deny that there's any civilian casualties whatsoever.
[01:05:02.492 --> 01:05:09.882]  Well, it shows a decadent disconnect from reality because most of the people talking like this have never had it tough.
[01:05:09.902 --> 01:05:10.343]  They're just...
[01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:11.870]  Yeah, it's racist, it's...
[01:05:33.974 --> 01:05:38.737]  And they would advocate the kind of policies that Israel is formulating for the future with this ethno-bomb.
[01:05:38.998 --> 01:05:48.224]  But why do they think, and we'll talk about the ethno-bomb in a second after the break, but why do these people think that if our government and other governments will go do this evil stuff, that they won't do it to us?
[01:05:48.304 --> 01:05:51.646]  See, people feel like they're part of this system and they're powerful.
[01:05:52.006 --> 01:05:52.787]  No, idiots!
[01:05:53.087 --> 01:05:53.547]  You're not.
[01:05:53.587 --> 01:05:55.267]  You're going to have your farm and ranch taken.
[01:05:55.448 --> 01:05:56.768]  You're going to have your property taken.
[01:05:56.788 --> 01:05:58.668]  You're going to have your children CPS'd.
[01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:00.249]  You're going to be forced on drugs.
[01:06:00.409 --> 01:06:03.029]  You're going to have a national sales tax on top of the income tax.
[01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:04.429]  You're going to be a slave.
[01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:06.530]  You're going to lose your job to illegal aliens.
[01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.190]  They're going to get rid of the United States.
[01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:09.650]  It's happening, you idiots!
[01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:10.271]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:17.052]  Yeah, but they think it's for the biblical greater good that it's part of God's plan to kill babies for the greater good of Israel.
[01:06:17.612 --> 01:06:18.432]  But it's not!
[01:06:20.133 --> 01:06:21.913]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:27.669]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us here on the GCN Radio Network final segment.
[01:06:27.689 --> 01:06:32.192]  We'll talk about the ethnocentric weapons, race-specific bioweapons on the other side.
[01:06:39.176 --> 01:06:44.620]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:52.645]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:06:53.359 --> 01:07:00.403]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:07:00.803 --> 01:07:12.230]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:16.052]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:07:16.492 --> 01:07:18.413]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:07:18.754 --> 01:07:22.596]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:36.162 --> 01:07:38.004]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:39.926]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:40.546]  What?
[01:07:41.147 --> 01:07:41.427]  Again?
[01:07:42.185 --> 01:07:43.806]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:07:44.086 --> 01:07:45.327]  Honey, we better stop.
[01:07:45.527 --> 01:07:47.808]  I gave the kids their sport-burkey water bottles.
[01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:49.429]  Why did you do that?
[01:07:49.709 --> 01:07:52.171]  Because they can't sip and talk at the same time.
[01:07:52.391 --> 01:07:55.233]  Or would you rather listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:07:55.513 --> 01:07:56.533]  Are we there yet?
[01:07:56.593 --> 01:07:57.914]  for the entire trip?
[01:07:57.934 --> 01:08:00.315]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:08:00.836 --> 01:08:01.836]  Great idea.
[01:08:02.136 --> 01:08:04.718]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:07.590]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:12.191]  And using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:08:12.372 --> 01:08:14.492]  And we can purify water from the lake as well.
[01:08:14.732 --> 01:08:16.673]  Honey, you're terrific!
[01:08:17.213 --> 01:08:17.933]  I know, dear.
[01:08:18.234 --> 01:08:19.734]  Now find us a restroom.
[01:08:20.234 --> 01:08:21.115]  I need to stop, too.
[01:08:21.295 --> 01:08:25.776]  Get your Berkey Sport purification bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:26.116]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:08:26.156 --> 01:08:27.717]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:08:36.775 --> 01:08:42.697]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:08:42.937 --> 01:08:45.178]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:08:45.378 --> 01:08:51.740]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:52.720]  We're good to go.
[01:09:21.516 --> 01:09:21.876]  I want you to...
[01:09:50.945 --> 01:10:09.650]  Realize that the PNAC document has so many dark and horrible things in it, but one of the big ones in there is Dick Cheney says we need to use our friends in the media to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons against the Arabs.
[01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:13.151]  And that's an almost exact quote.
[01:10:13.171 --> 01:10:14.991]  I'm going from memory, but I've got a pretty good memory.
[01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:17.252]  It's a slight paraphrase, but that's almost exact.
[01:10:17.731 --> 01:10:18.592]  Word for word.
[01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.114]  Michael Meacher pointed that out in an article he wrote.
[01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.296]  And there's hundreds of these PNAC documents.
[01:10:23.336 --> 01:10:25.037]  I mean, these guys are sinister.
[01:10:26.378 --> 01:10:27.419]  Now, you think the Arabs?
[01:10:27.439 --> 01:10:30.122]  The Arabs talk about wiping Israel off the map and fighting the U.S.?
[01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:30.722]  Can you imagine?
[01:10:31.623 --> 01:10:32.404]  They read all this.
[01:10:32.424 --> 01:10:33.645]  This is big news over there.
[01:10:34.165 --> 01:10:37.188]  Hey, we're going to create a virus that kills all of you.
[01:10:39.369 --> 01:10:41.751]  And they're going, okay, well, we're going to kill you, too.
[01:10:42.032 --> 01:10:43.853]  Oh, my gosh, they said they want to kill us.
[01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.775]  They're so vicious.
[01:10:46.713 --> 01:10:51.795]  And you're out around in your pickup trucks and your cars and your W stickers and your stupid Democrat stickers.
[01:10:52.355 --> 01:10:56.597]  Americans, the average American, you don't even have an idea, one-tenth of how bad it is, okay?
[01:10:56.877 --> 01:11:01.059]  The predators running our country could care less about you and your family.
[01:11:01.419 --> 01:11:04.840]  Everything they do is to fleece you and control you and dumb you down.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:12.263]  And you better grow up and you better wake up and stop feeling like you're part of some power structure that's going to kill some Arabs, Paul.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:23.129]  Yeah, and there's another quote from PNAC where Wolfowitz and Crystal are urging the Pentagon to use these ethno-bombs.
[01:11:23.929 --> 01:11:32.838]  Quote, cutting-edge biological warfare targeting a certain genotype could turn the reign of terrorism into a politically useful tool.
[01:11:34.319 --> 01:11:39.464]  They're saying politically useful because that gives them the excuse to kill all the Arabs.
[01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:51.069]  Yeah, and then in that fear-mongering piece that was on Hannity and Combs... Hey, why don't you write an article headlined, Crystal and PNAC boys call for using bioweapons to kill all Arabs.
[01:11:51.089 --> 01:11:52.329]  I think that would be a good article.
[01:11:52.529 --> 01:11:53.489]  I'm sorry, Paul, go ahead.
[01:11:54.669 --> 01:12:09.732]  Yeah, and I wrote an article about Hannity and Combs a couple of weeks ago, a week ago, where they had this guy on saying that if Hezbollah nukes Tel Aviv, then Jews in the immediate area would be killed by the explosion.
[01:12:10.157 --> 01:12:10.277]  Yeah.
[01:12:31.886 --> 01:12:43.835]  Well, yeah, the same Zionists that run Israel, the ones that made deals with Hitler to not let Jews leave unless they agreed to go to Israel and join the Zionists, and then they would make Jews pay them protection money to then allow them out of the country.
[01:12:44.055 --> 01:12:45.596]  I mean, that's on the record, folks.
[01:12:46.317 --> 01:12:48.919]  And I guess if you're against killing Jews, you're anti-Semitic.
[01:12:48.959 --> 01:12:49.940]  Well, then I'm anti-Semitic.
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.100]  I'm against killing Jews.
[01:12:52.421 --> 01:12:55.784]  And the Orthodox Jews that protested in Israel against
[01:12:56.844 --> 01:13:02.148]  The aggressive policies of the Israeli government are imprisoned, so I guess they're anti-Semitic as well.
[01:13:02.428 --> 01:13:07.712]  Well, and they also grab most of the Orthodox Jews' sects that are against Israel.
[01:13:08.213 --> 01:13:25.927]  The CPS grabs most of their kids now, so... And then, as mentioned before, it was in the London Times that Israel was close to completing this ethno-bomb, but they were having trouble in separating or isolating the particular characteristics of certain Arabs
[01:13:27.215 --> 01:13:31.996]  Because Arabs and Jews are both Semites, so they've got very close relations in genes.
[01:13:32.336 --> 01:13:35.737]  But, I mean, with their mindset, they probably don't even care.
[01:13:35.757 --> 01:13:36.557]  They just want chaos.
[01:13:36.898 --> 01:13:42.699]  But that won't hurt the European Ashkenazi who really don't have any bloodlines to the ancient Israelites.
[01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:46.780]  So, boy, look out if you're Sephardic.
[01:13:47.432 --> 01:13:52.114]  Hey, Paul, I really appreciate you joining us today on this bumpy ride, and keep up the great work.
[01:13:52.134 --> 01:13:57.856]  We'll all be looking at prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv for all the big developments you're putting out, and we all appreciate you.
[01:13:58.356 --> 01:13:59.116]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[01:13:59.296 --> 01:13:59.817]  God bless.
[01:14:00.377 --> 01:14:04.498]  We work really hard for you, folks, so please read the sites, get the news, spread it around and help us.
[01:14:05.079 --> 01:14:09.640]  Don't forget, I'm going to be premiering Terror Storm up in Dallas on the 26th of this month, so get your tickets now.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.021]  All right, God bless you all.
[01:14:11.061 --> 01:14:11.381]  Bye-bye.
