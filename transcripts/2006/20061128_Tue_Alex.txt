[00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.450]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.171]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:09.991]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:11.432]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.112]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:17.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.953 --> 00:00:20.294]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.062]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.744]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:32.751]  Welcome to folks listening all over the planet and the ships at sea.
[00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:48.820]  It is the 28th day of November 2006.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.202]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:55.142 --> 00:01:03.385]  We do have an update coming up in the third hour on the Wesley Snipes case with the IRS from his tax advisor's associate.
[00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:11.788]  His tax advisor has been unceremoniously kidnapped out of a foreign country by gun-wielding Treasury agents.
[00:01:12.953 --> 00:01:17.334]  So we'll be discussing that bit of thuggery later.
[00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:25.757]  We're going to have wide open phones and I'm going to try to control my diatribes in this first hour and attempt to start going to your calls in the next segment.
[00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:30.698]  We can talk about what's happening in Iraq, what's going on with the economy, what's developing with the dollar.
[00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.480]  We can talk about the Democrats who are openly saying that they want completely open borders, end of sovereignty.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.421]  The Feds are coming in saying they're going to sue.
[00:01:40.328 --> 00:01:41.029]  I don't know.
[00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:03.866]  Uh... different thuggish things that police have done when they pull you over.
[00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:07.270]  Screaming at you, yelling at you, treating you like a slave.
[00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.598]  And if you've seen cops doing something good, changing attire, or helping little old ladies, you're welcome to call in about that as well.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.565]  But I wanted to canvas the public on just how serious the uh...
[00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:29.677]  Federalization and the brainwashing and the twisting of the paramilitary domestic forces, and that's what they are, has gotten.
[00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:33.818]  The gang with a flag, the gang with a badge and a gun.
[00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.740]  We will be discussing that as well today.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.961]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.681]  800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:53.015]  France in vigilance plea on falling dollar.
[00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:57.975]  Financial Times of London, they're saying, we don't want it to plunge too quickly.
[00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:05.777]  Of course it will plunge, it will become almost worthless, but it needs to be done delicately or it could damage global financial markets.
[00:03:05.857 --> 00:03:18.799]  It's the same chant that we've been hearing the last six years out of the private banks that own us, and they're saying America's being destroyed a little too quickly.
[00:03:20.593 --> 00:03:22.334]  So, we'll be going over this report.
[00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:25.694]  France in vigilance plea on falling dollar.
[00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:34.977]  The average yuppie knows all about the Sugar Daddy's show on E!
[00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:36.177]  Entertainment.
[00:03:37.357 --> 00:03:43.979]  And they know all about how to act cool at the local bar, but they don't know what a devalued currency means.
[00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.200]  They will soon learn, I'm afraid.
[00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.262]  And by then it'll be too late for them, of course.
[00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:51.723]  That doesn't matter.
[00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:58.508]  The government will tell them about some scapegoat to blame and then they'll feel good and stick their thumbs in their mouths like they always do.
[00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:00.969]  Existing home sales rise.
[00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.170]  Prices fall.
[00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:06.653]  They've had the double and triple mortgages.
[00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.454]  People living off their mortgages.
[00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:13.277]  And now the honeymoon is beginning to rapidly fall.
[00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:15.639]  The House of Cards is falling right now.
[00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:23.349]  If you think a 17.4% drop in the last real estate period is bad, get ready.
[00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:29.675]  They're projecting it's going to more than double that decline rate in the next period.
[00:04:30.896 --> 00:04:33.479]  So we'll be discussing what that really means.
[00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.802]  But don't worry, the government's got a plan.
[00:04:35.822 --> 00:04:38.665]  They're the ones that orchestrated this entire thing.
[00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:40.280]  So what?
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.481]  Let's learn to worship them.
[00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:42.462]  Thank them.
[00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:44.123]  The sun comes up because of them.
[00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:46.805]  Oh, thank you, global bankers.
[00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:47.886]  Thank you, master.
[00:04:48.427 --> 00:04:52.430]  We'll cover this and a lot more and take your calls on the other side.
[00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.971]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:07.680]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.981]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.342 --> 00:05:18.008]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.688 --> 00:05:25.754]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.154 --> 00:05:33.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, the NSA spying,
[00:05:33.502 --> 00:05:37.544]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.864 --> 00:05:41.365]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:43.766]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.086 --> 00:05:48.007]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:09.344]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:09.604 --> 00:06:13.965]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:14.246 --> 00:06:23.169]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.970]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.313]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:32.614 --> 00:06:39.338]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:39.818 --> 00:06:40.359]  What about you?
[00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:46.470]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.591]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:07:00.991 --> 00:07:04.576]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:07:04.836 --> 00:07:05.697]  Look no further!
[00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:08.581]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:17.512]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:07:17.672 --> 00:07:19.354]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[00:07:19.414 --> 00:07:20.034]  I think so.
[00:07:35.242 --> 00:07:35.642]  I don't know.
[00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:08.710]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:12.314]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:47.676 --> 00:08:50.218]  You know what?
[00:09:15.965 --> 00:09:17.185]  I do that more and more often.
[00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:26.667]  I'm so busy here at the office and I'm out basically giving orders, working on stories, during the little breaks.
[00:09:27.447 --> 00:09:36.809]  And so I'll end up talking to the folks running the show, getting the callers, and then I'll run out of the studio and then just lose track of time and come back and they're like, uh, you weren't there.
[00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:40.010]  I tell you, I've got a
[00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:53.277]  I've got to find some way to simplify things, but instead I'm just taking on more and more because I realize you only live once and everything we do, every person we wake up is one step closer to defeating this new world order.
[00:09:53.818 --> 00:09:58.000]  And for those that say we can't defeat the globalists, we don't have a choice, okay?
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:05.243]  They're setting up world tyranny, worldwide government, worldwide oppression.
[00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:10.166]  They're openly saying they're going to break our families up, put us in labor camps,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:19.226]  They're openly pushing total and complete dehumanization, which has been the norm in human history.
[00:10:19.326 --> 00:10:23.069]  I know that that is a maxim I repeat, because it is true!
[00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:25.851]  Go just do a cursory inspection of history!
[00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:36.319]  It is a horror story, and freedom, free societies, are these tiny little moats in an ocean of oppression.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:55.452]  And if you are aware of the tyranny of government, if you are aware of the corruption of government, if you are aware of all of evil men's tricks, and you fight with every fiber you've got, you may get some semblance of liberty and autonomy for you and your family.
[00:10:56.494 --> 00:11:13.459]  Now, compare that with the dumbed-down, drooling, flesh-loving population of this country, myself included, slovenly, decadent, all of those sins.
[00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:18.100]  Just look at us, and we are ripe for bondage.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.521]  We are going into bondage.
[00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:23.322]  The good news is, though, the public
[00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:53.338]  Drunk on entertainment and on sports and sex and diversions and on gobbling food, we are literally now beginning to see the prison walls that have been built around us so people are starting to stir, they are starting to listen, they're starting to realize that all is not well in the state of Denmark.
[00:11:54.128 --> 00:11:58.352]  John and Lewis and Marilyn and Ken and Ruth, we're going to go to your calls in just a moment.
[00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:00.953]  I'm trying.
[00:12:00.993 --> 00:12:02.314]  I'm getting better and better about it.
[00:12:02.394 --> 00:12:20.727]  I've been saying this for years about taking your calls because I love the different directions you take us in, but because we're going to take a lot of calls today, have your question and comments, your statement, or the disagreement you have ready so we can move through your call to the next one so you all get a chance to get involved on air.
[00:12:20.747 --> 00:12:21.887]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:31.077]  France in vigilance plea on falling dollar.
[00:12:31.157 --> 00:12:32.518]  Financial Times of London.
[00:12:33.718 --> 00:12:35.139]  A very elite newspaper.
[00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:45.742]  You will find more truth here than anywhere else and that's because a lot of high level functionaries and upper middle class in Europe and in the US read this paper.
[00:12:47.223 --> 00:12:50.744]  And so they'll come right out and say they're going to set up a world depression.
[00:12:50.764 --> 00:12:52.705]  They'll come right out and say they're going to take your guns.
[00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:56.026]  They'll come right out and say what they're doing in this publication.
[00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:57.893]  With limited spin.
[00:12:59.114 --> 00:13:02.254]  France in vigilance plea on falling dollar.
[00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:17.698]  France on Monday led European concern over the rising euro in an apparent attempt to put pressure on the European Central Bank not to jeopardize eurozone growth prospects ahead of next year's French presidential election.
[00:13:19.557 --> 00:13:26.381]  Thierry Baton, France's finance minister, urged collective vigilance in the face of the falling U.S.
[00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:26.842]  dollar.
[00:13:28.002 --> 00:13:30.844]  And again, you talk to the average American, they go, what's that mean?
[00:13:31.004 --> 00:13:32.465]  What, did it fall off a building?
[00:13:32.785 --> 00:13:34.546]  Did a helicopter drop some dollars?
[00:13:34.886 --> 00:13:35.747]  Where'd this happen?
[00:13:35.807 --> 00:13:36.627]  I want some!
[00:13:36.727 --> 00:13:39.569]  And I'm not being sardonic or mean, that's the mentality.
[00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:47.374]  We've all seen, at least if you watch TV occasionally, Jay Leno's jaywalking segments where he goes out and 70 plus percent
[00:13:47.924 --> 00:13:50.886]  And this is army captains and doctors and school teachers.
[00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:52.186]  Who's the vice president?
[00:13:52.307 --> 00:13:52.807]  Lincoln?
[00:13:55.208 --> 00:14:01.232]  I mean, you have a public that knows how big the yachts are of Hugh Hefner.
[00:14:02.472 --> 00:14:06.995]  And you've got a public that knows the waistline of Angelina Jolie.
[00:14:08.076 --> 00:14:13.839]  And you've got women who are primping in the mirror 24 hours a day and who have been taught how to be insecure.
[00:14:14.784 --> 00:14:30.192]  But you don't, and you've got men strutting around wearing t-shirts with skulls and death's insignia all over them, bugging their eyes out when they walk around acting manly, but if a cop pulled them over and they start licking their boots and shaking like a little girl.
[00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:32.814]  I mean, we really are pathetic!
[00:14:33.354 --> 00:14:35.155]  Land of the coward, home of the slaves!
[00:14:36.164 --> 00:14:44.806]  And we're not going to turn this around until we remember what we once were and stop acting like this and get our priorities straight and get our heads screwed on!
[00:14:44.826 --> 00:14:47.227]  I love this country!
[00:14:47.947 --> 00:14:51.088]  And I can't stand seeing it being dismembered in front of me!
[00:14:51.108 --> 00:14:57.530]  Alright, I said I was going to go to your calls and I'm going to settle down.
[00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.551]  I just... Frankly, I'm not into money.
[00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:03.810]  But money is like fuel in a gas tank.
[00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:21.558]  I need it to pay my employees, to make films, to travel, to cover events, and to, yeah, you know, have reliable transportation and put clothes on my family's back and have a little bit of money in the bank, a little bit of gold cashed away in case of an emergency so I can provide.
[00:15:21.578 --> 00:15:29.441]  Okay, the trinkets, the garbage, the bling, the signals of power and status, I actually hate them.
[00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:32.937]  Because it robs your soul.
[00:15:32.957 --> 00:15:34.939]  It distracts from what's real.
[00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:37.100]  People wear it as a mask.
[00:15:37.961 --> 00:15:39.002]  People are posing.
[00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:39.702]  They're primping.
[00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:40.403]  They're pimping.
[00:15:40.443 --> 00:15:42.684]  They're not really living.
[00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:45.527]  They're playing roles and lying to themselves.
[00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:47.108]  They're in a delusional state.
[00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:59.217]  But it does burn me that the little bit of money I've saved, that I did keep in the bank, the money I put in the golds, all in appreciated and increasing value,
[00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:01.823]  Has been devalued now by 50%.
[00:16:02.644 --> 00:16:03.204]  That's right.
[00:16:03.444 --> 00:16:04.545]  I keep saying 45, 47.
[00:16:05.306 --> 00:16:06.627]  I'm always letting you know where it's at.
[00:16:06.907 --> 00:16:09.308]  It's right at 50% right now and rapidly plunging.
[00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:11.870]  I hope you understand that.
[00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.671]  I hope you're angry about that.
[00:16:14.032 --> 00:16:18.835]  The money you've got in the bank is being turned into toilet paper right now.
[00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:22.898]  And again, some poor Mexican immigrant.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:39.415]  I was talking to one on the street the other day, who'd been at a family member's house who had cable, and he'd seen the show and spoke a little English, and heard me talking about this, and he said, yes, the dollar, not, not so good now, very bad, like, starting to be like peso, oh, but you talk to one of these slack jawed...
[00:16:40.596 --> 00:16:45.180]  Glistening-eyed, little tinkerbell establishment types.
[00:16:45.221 --> 00:16:53.768]  I don't care if you're a liberal or conservative, you know the people we're talking about, who think they're members of the system and who will make excuses for whatever the government and the media are doing.
[00:16:54.449 --> 00:17:05.159]  And see, what they do is, when they're faced with a threat, these yuppies just decide to accept it and rationalize it as if they're part of the power structure and as if nothing threatens them.
[00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:08.006]  And I want to punch them.
[00:17:08.667 --> 00:17:10.048]  I want to go, does this threaten you?
[00:17:10.108 --> 00:17:11.409]  And just break their nose.
[00:17:11.469 --> 00:17:12.090]  I mean, I do.
[00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.593]  I want to beat them upside the head and go, hey, do you feel that?
[00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:20.377]  Because it's people like you that have destroyed this country!
[00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:24.460]  It's people like you that have destroyed this nation!
[00:17:29.044 --> 00:17:34.208]  It's people like you that when the globalists pull the plug on this country's financial system, they've already pulled the plug.
[00:17:34.248 --> 00:17:35.249]  They're about to let us know.
[00:17:35.985 --> 00:17:39.007]  It's people like you that are going to stampede and do whatever the government says.
[00:17:39.507 --> 00:17:48.253]  They'll be promising you your Lexuses and your bling back as long as you do what you're told and as long as you blame the scapegoats they've given you.
[00:17:51.575 --> 00:18:00.621]  That's the sick part is I'm going to have to sit here and watch the people that engineered this have their boots licked by the likes of you, you trash!
[00:18:02.938 --> 00:18:03.998]  I'm not talking to our audience.
[00:18:04.038 --> 00:18:06.159]  I'm talking to the yuppie that's driving along, giggling.
[00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:08.960]  You go ahead and giggle, you little punk!
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.581]  France in vigilance plea on following dollar.
[00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:28.644]  In spite of recent foreign currency movements, the ECB is expected to press ahead with another quarter point rise in its main interest rate of 3.5 percent next week, which will encourage buying of euros.
[00:18:29.365 --> 00:18:31.045]  Again, yuppie, you better find out what that means.
[00:18:32.185 --> 00:18:52.312]  But, if sustained, the Euro's appreciation could curb the scope for further rises in borrowing costs, in 2007, Mr. Britton's initiative may have been aimed at setting the tone of the debate on monetary policy action beyond the December 7th ECB meeting.
[00:18:53.317 --> 00:19:11.602]  French anxiety, which compared with a more relaxed mood in Germany, has been heightened since the economy ground to a halt unexpectedly in the third quarter after an exceptionally strong second quarter that has prompted economists to cut their growth estimates from the year to the bottom of the governments targeted 2.2.5%.
[00:19:15.916 --> 00:19:25.807]  A French official said Mr. Britton had deliberately changed his tone on the Euro from saying it was fully valued when it was trading at 1.24 to 1.28 against the U.S.
[00:19:25.847 --> 00:19:28.510]  dollar to calling for collective vigilance.
[00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.914]  Now it has moved above the 1.30 mark and rising.
[00:19:34.096 --> 00:19:36.118]  You're going, wait a minute, you said a 50% reduction.
[00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:37.579]  That's only 30.
[00:19:39.577 --> 00:19:46.323]  I look at 1999 numbers, that's what they look at, the central banks, versus what's happening with Euro release.
[00:19:47.724 --> 00:19:51.767]  And it was trading at about 80 when it opened, 80 cents to the dollar.
[00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:53.468]  So that's 50.
[00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:54.089]  20 and 30 is 50.
[00:19:54.949 --> 00:19:56.110]  And I'm no mathematician.
[00:19:56.471 --> 00:19:58.732]  We'll be right back with your calls straight ahead.
[00:19:58.832 --> 00:20:03.196]  Stay with us.

[00:20:10.185 --> 00:20:12.106]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:12.606 --> 00:20:13.607]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:15.067]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[00:20:15.107 --> 00:20:15.528]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:16.128 --> 00:20:18.909]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:22.251]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:20:22.271 --> 00:20:23.812]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:20:23.832 --> 00:20:24.773]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:40.716]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:21:05.859 --> 00:21:13.922]  Did you know that Senate committee investigations in the 1960s called the international communist movement the greatest conspiracy the world has ever witnessed?
[00:21:14.822 --> 00:21:22.044]  They said the communists had infiltrated into high government offices in the State Department and also advisors to presidents.
[00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:30.657]  Did you know that the Communist infiltration successfully stopped all FBI investigations into their secret activities?

[00:22:09.843 --> 00:22:10.463]  Yeah.

[00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:16.028]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:22:16.489 --> 00:22:17.990]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.152]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:22:20.532 --> 00:22:22.294]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:22:22.514 --> 00:22:23.355]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:22:23.755 --> 00:22:26.018]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:26.598]  What?

[00:23:04.169 --> 00:23:06.110]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.992]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[00:23:09.818 --> 00:23:18.242]  The best-kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:23:40.742 --> 00:23:42.024]  That's www.L-A-Z-M-E-D-I-N-C.com.
[00:23:42.044 --> 00:23:44.406]  Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
[00:24:31.193 --> 00:24:32.594]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:34.154 --> 00:24:35.215]  We're going to go to your calls.
[00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:39.977]  We're going to go ahead and go to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:24:43.538 --> 00:24:45.639]  I'm just shocked and actually speechless right now.
[00:24:46.377 --> 00:24:48.198]  Bush has said the Internet is terrorist.
[00:24:48.238 --> 00:24:51.579]  He said that people that say 9-11 is an inside job work for Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:53.520]  They've said a lot of things.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.741]  In Europe they're banning many types of free speech.
[00:24:56.341 --> 00:25:08.466]  Newt Gingrich in the US of A, union leader, staff writer, gave a speech two days ago saying we've got to go ahead and ban the First Amendment to stop terrorism.
[00:25:08.786 --> 00:25:11.687]  And they said that we need to just start arresting people and there's no free speech.
[00:25:12.568 --> 00:25:15.869]  And they got TV shows and dramas everywhere where people get arrested for their speech.
[00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:20.042]  And the cops will come and arrest people, and at that point you've got to defend yourself.
[00:25:20.442 --> 00:25:22.524]  They are terrorists at that point.
[00:25:23.064 --> 00:25:24.005]  They are the terrorists.
[00:25:24.746 --> 00:25:26.267]  Newt Gingrich is such a criminal.
[00:25:27.288 --> 00:25:31.952]  Gingrich raises alarm at an event honoring those who stand up for freedom of speech.
[00:25:32.852 --> 00:25:36.796]  And it goes on with this quote saying we need to go ahead and ban the First Amendment.
[00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:40.499]  And then I have one out of England yesterday, London Guardian.
[00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:44.402]  Police want power to crack down on offensive demos, chants, and slogans.
[00:25:45.237 --> 00:25:49.378]  It says that any speech or demonstration must be pre-approved with the text of any speeches.
[00:25:49.818 --> 00:25:53.219]  Placards must be pre-approved just to make sure it doesn't hurt anyone's feelings.
[00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:57.260]  See, folks, they're not playing games.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.020]  And you know why?
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.560]  Because we're exposing them.
[00:26:00.881 --> 00:26:02.261]  And we're going to keep exposing them.
[00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:04.542]  And I'll say whatever I want, you criminals!
[00:26:05.502 --> 00:26:06.162]  You scum!
[00:26:08.422 --> 00:26:09.342]  I've got to control myself.
[00:26:09.382 --> 00:26:10.282]  I'm just really mad.
[00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:12.043]  They're killing our country in front of us.
[00:26:12.483 --> 00:26:15.203]  John Illinois, then Louis, and everybody else.
[00:26:15.243 --> 00:26:15.843]  Go ahead, John.
[00:26:16.864 --> 00:26:18.904]  Alex, first of all, thank you very much.
[00:26:18.984 --> 00:26:19.844]  I'm a supporter.
[00:26:19.924 --> 00:26:23.365]  I've been burning DVDs like mad and handing them out.
[00:26:23.785 --> 00:26:26.985]  I made a compilation DVD that includes some of your work.
[00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:30.146]  I've also signed up as a monthly supporter.
[00:26:30.626 --> 00:26:34.787]  I give a little bit of money each month to your organization because we've got to keep it going.
[00:26:36.738 --> 00:26:47.143]  One question, I got an email notice from Lone Lantern about a planned one million person march on Washington D.C.
[00:26:47.263 --> 00:26:55.146]  on September 11th of 2007 and that would be great if we could get a million persons but I doubt if we're going to get that.
[00:26:55.186 --> 00:27:00.348]  Yeah, we got two thousand in New York, so... What do you think?
[00:27:00.428 --> 00:27:03.850]  I mean, let's say they try to declare martial law, what about
[00:27:04.514 --> 00:27:07.035]  Rallying the troops and marching on Washington.
[00:27:07.736 --> 00:27:18.921]  You know, ever since I've been involved in this movement, the Patriot Movement, the Truth Movement, the Freedom Movement, whatever you want to call it, the resistance movement against tyranny and against the one world government anti-Christ peace system.
[00:27:20.578 --> 00:27:26.807]  I always hear this magic thing about a million-person march on Washington, an armed march.
[00:27:28.109 --> 00:27:31.012]  I'm certainly against an armed march that would play right into their hands.
[00:27:31.032 --> 00:27:33.516]  They would definitely target that with provocateur actions.
[00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:36.540]  I mean, I'm all for a million-person march on 9-11.
[00:27:38.327 --> 00:27:46.714]  It's just that I don't think that we would get those type of numbers, but I mean, I'll certainly support whatever folks are doing, and I appreciate your call, John.
[00:27:47.094 --> 00:27:49.837]  Let's talk to Lewis in New Jersey.
[00:27:49.857 --> 00:27:50.557]  Go ahead, Lewis.
[00:27:51.858 --> 00:27:52.239]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:53.059]  Hello.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.582]  I just wanted to give you some updates.
[00:27:57.383 --> 00:28:02.307]  I called previously, said that I was going out to different military and police websites.
[00:28:02.367 --> 00:28:03.788]  I've been getting some responses there.
[00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:07.112]  So what have you been doing to the websites?
[00:28:07.132 --> 00:28:08.193]  You've been sending them emails?
[00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:17.097]  I've been going on to specifically military.com for now, going into the forums and just posting, trying to start a dialogue with people.
[00:28:17.237 --> 00:28:18.798]  Very effective.
[00:28:19.078 --> 00:28:19.598]  What's happened?
[00:28:20.278 --> 00:28:29.942]  I've gotten some sarcastic responses, but a lot of times when they give me those and I give them a logical response with some evidence to back it up, a lot of people have just not responded.
[00:28:30.562 --> 00:28:43.207]  But the most important part is the specific topic that I posted, Military's last line of defense against New World Order, has gotten over 130 views in the two weeks that it's been up there.
[00:28:45.954 --> 00:28:47.656]  Well, the truth is always the way to go.
[00:28:47.696 --> 00:28:53.941]  And the truth is, the military and our police either will be the instrument of tyranny or the instrument of its destruction.
[00:28:54.542 --> 00:28:55.883]  And I know they're good police.
[00:28:55.943 --> 00:28:58.666]  I get their letters, I get their calls, I get their pat on the backs.
[00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:00.447]  And I'm not against police.
[00:29:00.607 --> 00:29:01.148]  I'm against
[00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:12.766]  What their system has turned into, how they've let themselves be co-opted, how they've let themselves be brainwashed, how so many of them are rude and hateful to respectful citizens.
[00:29:13.606 --> 00:29:16.467]  And I demand they research our claims.
[00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.368]  I demand they find out it's true.
[00:29:18.668 --> 00:29:22.030]  And I demand they join us or declare themselves as evil.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.541]  That's what Jesus said.
[00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:26.002]  He said, you're either hot or cold.
[00:29:26.142 --> 00:29:28.603]  If you're lukewarm, I will spit you out of my mouth.
[00:29:29.043 --> 00:29:30.784]  Listen, you need to pick sides.
[00:29:31.585 --> 00:29:33.786]  And I'm telling you, I'm throwing down the gauntlet.
[00:29:34.546 --> 00:29:36.988]  Because there is no lukewarm middle of the road.
[00:29:37.348 --> 00:29:41.110]  If you think you're just coasting for retirement, no.
[00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:41.650]  You're evil.
[00:29:43.011 --> 00:29:46.633]  If you know there's wrong going on and you let it happen, you're part of the problem.
[00:29:47.053 --> 00:29:47.653]  Stay there, sir.
[00:29:47.673 --> 00:29:49.154]  I want to hear what else you have to say.
[00:29:52.026 --> 00:29:55.008]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[00:31:03.263 --> 00:31:04.304]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:31:04.624 --> 00:31:07.407]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:31:07.687 --> 00:31:11.831]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:31:12.272 --> 00:31:13.092]  So what do you do?
[00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:17.977]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:31:18.462 --> 00:31:20.583]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:21.964]  Sheltering in place.
[00:31:22.384 --> 00:31:26.106]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[00:32:01.403 --> 00:32:07.346]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:32:14.179 --> 00:32:17.481]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:33:09.057 --> 00:33:10.979]  It'll build the big guns.
[00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:15.743]  It'll build the airplanes.
[00:33:17.725 --> 00:33:19.626]  It'll build all the bombs.
[00:33:22.128 --> 00:33:24.410]  It'll hide behind walls.
[00:33:26.452 --> 00:33:28.254]  It'll hide behind desks.
[00:33:30.576 --> 00:33:34.639]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[00:33:37.156 --> 00:34:00.980]  You that never done nothing But built to destroy You play with my world Like it's your little toy You put a gun in my hand And you hide from my eyes
[00:34:03.158 --> 00:34:11.983]  And you turn and run farther when those fast bullets fly, like the Judas of old.
[00:34:14.144 --> 00:34:20.528]  You lie and deceive, a world war can be won.
[00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:28.012]  You want me to believe, but it's easier
[00:34:33.779 --> 00:34:35.120]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:38.282 --> 00:34:52.093]  Now, more of your calls are coming up.
[00:34:52.113 --> 00:34:56.296]  I'm going to let Lewis finish up with his actions online going into
[00:34:56.986 --> 00:35:01.831]  The different military and police message boards, trying to educate them, trying to engage them.
[00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:11.120]  You see, it's a closed shop, just like the mafia, or just like a corporation, just like any tribal organization.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:15.384]  You're not supposed to ask questions, you're supposed to follow whatever the leader says.
[00:35:15.944 --> 00:35:20.209]  And so a lot of people basically just decide to love their captivity,
[00:35:20.929 --> 00:35:24.750]  And to go along with it and make fun of anybody that asks questions.
[00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:31.132]  But we have a lot of good police and a lot of wonderful people in the military, a lot of good people in the government, and they are awake.
[00:35:31.152 --> 00:35:37.234]  And that's one reason this tyranny hasn't come down full bore on us yet, is because there are so many good people in the system.
[00:35:37.254 --> 00:35:39.374]  So we'll go back to him in just a few minutes.
[00:35:39.394 --> 00:35:45.556]  You know, he comes on with us once a month, but I want to get him back on next week because it's so important
[00:35:46.818 --> 00:35:48.598]  Because it's an American company.
[00:35:48.678 --> 00:35:52.839]  It's been around for what, their 60th anniversary is coming up.
[00:35:52.899 --> 00:35:56.740]  His father founded it and now he works with his son.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.261]  And it's Calvin Pure Soap Company based out in Oakland, California.
[00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:06.961]  And it's amazing organic soap.
[00:36:07.181 --> 00:36:09.842]  And it, I mean, you've heard how much I love it.
[00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:15.963]  You've heard me tell you the story, at least some of you have, that he was a sponsor, I guess going back three, four years ago on Genesis.
[00:36:16.764 --> 00:36:21.086]  And for some reason he just had heard about my show and decided to send me a year's supply.
[00:36:21.667 --> 00:36:23.668]  So I got it and I just said, here's some soap.
[00:36:23.688 --> 00:36:24.668]  I don't know what it is.
[00:36:25.288 --> 00:36:27.810]  My wife comes back and goes, this is really great stuff.
[00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.692]  The dishwashing soap is wonderful.
[00:36:31.752 --> 00:36:32.972]  It doesn't irritate my skin.
[00:36:33.033 --> 00:36:35.074]  The soaps, the bar soap, the shampoo is wonderful.
[00:36:35.494 --> 00:36:36.154]  And she ran out.
[00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:37.355]  She said, get me some more of that.
[00:36:37.715 --> 00:36:41.257]  So I just mentioned to the folks on the network that I liked it and they told Marty he sent me more.
[00:36:41.757 --> 00:36:43.418]  Then, a year later, that ran out.
[00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.632]  And then my wife ordered some.
[00:36:45.733 --> 00:36:50.205]  And then I just thought, why don't I just get him up and endorse his product?
[00:36:50.245 --> 00:36:51.569]  Because I don't endorse a lot of things.
[00:36:52.415 --> 00:36:56.318]  I mean, I don't endorse the magic machines and the magic creams and all the stuff that gets pitched.
[00:36:56.638 --> 00:36:59.660]  Whether it's real or not, that's just not what I'm into.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.082]  And the cancer cures and all the rest of it.
[00:37:02.582 --> 00:37:04.824]  I believe in high quality water filters made in America.
[00:37:04.844 --> 00:37:06.125]  I believe in documentary films.
[00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:10.568]  I believe in books and videos and information that I've read and that I've vetted.
[00:37:11.268 --> 00:37:12.569]  And I believe in this soap.
[00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:13.570]  It's soap.
[00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:14.611]  It's not detergent.
[00:37:15.011 --> 00:37:17.233]  It's 85% off supermarket costs.
[00:37:17.313 --> 00:37:19.114]  You will save a lot of money doing this.
[00:37:19.674 --> 00:37:21.756]  It's made in America and they're patriots.
[00:37:22.456 --> 00:37:23.457]  And you just can't beat it.
[00:37:23.797 --> 00:37:25.258]  Marty, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:37:25.618 --> 00:37:26.759]  Thank you for inviting me.
[00:37:26.799 --> 00:37:34.024]  It's always a pleasure talking to you, Alex, and sharing some good ideas, good information, and good soap.
[00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:39.722]  Now what, for 55, 56 years you guys didn't sell direct to the public.
[00:37:39.742 --> 00:37:43.323]  You only sold to hospitals, higher end hotels.
[00:37:44.084 --> 00:37:55.567]  Why did the hospitals and the hotels, and I was in a nice hotel once and did see some of your soap, what did they know the general public didn't know and why did you never get your soap into the stores?
[00:37:55.947 --> 00:38:00.008]  Well, commercial institutions want concentrated products.
[00:38:00.458 --> 00:38:05.340]  They don't want another puffery of the advertisement like Proctor, Lever, and Colgate.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.921]  They want commercial, low-cost cleaning products.
[00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:14.043]  And it's virtually impossible to get my products into a store.
[00:38:14.403 --> 00:38:15.904]  Believe me, I've tried.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:26.188]  And then a Procter & Gamble going back 30, 40 years ago that's admitted would pay the stores, literally at a loss for years, to themselves not to put anybody else's products on.
[00:38:26.408 --> 00:38:29.170]  They pay for the shelf space.
[00:38:29.471 --> 00:38:30.652]  That's called flooding.
[00:38:30.672 --> 00:38:42.121]  The consumer doesn't know about it, but the shelf space is leased and rented from the store so their products could be at eye level and they could control it and monopolize it.
[00:38:42.478 --> 00:38:43.699]  And I can't compete with that.
[00:38:44.019 --> 00:38:49.383]  I can't be paying millions of dollars to buy shelf space in supermarkets.
[00:38:49.723 --> 00:39:00.511]  But I found out by talking to a purchasing agent in a commercial institution, I can get products in, I can get samples in, I can make a demo, and I can get sales.
[00:39:01.131 --> 00:39:04.954]  I didn't know how to get my products to the consumer.
[00:39:05.606 --> 00:39:09.408]  And my products, I consider them the world's best-kept secret.
[00:39:09.768 --> 00:39:10.909]  Nobody knows about it.
[00:39:11.209 --> 00:39:14.570]  Well, you can go to the website, you can see all the organic certifications.
[00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.051]  Let's just talk about the bar soap.
[00:39:16.731 --> 00:39:19.012]  Now, I have to make a suggestion right away.
[00:39:19.032 --> 00:39:25.175]  Our bar soaps, every year, almost sell out because they're the ideal Christmas present.
[00:39:25.635 --> 00:39:33.179]  You can buy a case of a hundred bars or more, put them in a little plastic bag, and give them as gifts.
[00:39:33.757 --> 00:39:39.421]  Better than a bottle of booze, better than a box of detergent, or any one of these crummy gifts.
[00:39:39.742 --> 00:39:43.665]  Pure soap, 12 bars will last a customer almost a year.
[00:39:44.005 --> 00:39:47.107]  They will not only use it, not only like it, but they will love it!
[00:39:47.388 --> 00:39:48.949]  But, but, I mean, I'm not hyping this.
[00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:52.011]  Why, why do people, why does the bar soap smell so good?
[00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:54.793]  Well, it's made from organic materials.
[00:39:55.134 --> 00:40:02.059]  Coconut oil, and vegetable oil, and a few drops of pure almond oil, which is in the candy bars.
[00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:03.824]  And it's not a perfume.
[00:40:04.204 --> 00:40:07.585]  It's a natural juice that we insert into it.
[00:40:07.885 --> 00:40:09.526]  We do the same with the laundry soap.
[00:40:09.626 --> 00:40:11.526]  It has a little bit of cherry smell too though.
[00:40:11.546 --> 00:40:12.167]  Is there cherry in it?
[00:40:12.387 --> 00:40:14.908]  It's an almond cherry flavor.
[00:40:15.308 --> 00:40:19.309]  It's a food that we spray into the bar as we're making it.
[00:40:19.689 --> 00:40:22.310]  And it's been very well accepted by the consumer.
[00:40:22.591 --> 00:40:25.332]  It doesn't hurt, harm, pollute, burn.
[00:40:25.732 --> 00:40:28.053]  And it leaves a very pleasant aroma.
[00:40:28.413 --> 00:40:31.594]  Not only on the skin, but in the home and in the air.
[00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:42.249]  Well, I tell you, not a week goes by that we don't get a letter here going, man, I got a sample, a little $14 pack that's got a sample of everything in it.
[00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:44.650]  Now, you know, I got a year's supply.
[00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:45.850]  Oh, my wife loves it.
[00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:47.711]  It's saving us so much money.
[00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:49.531]  But that's how it is with the New World Order.
[00:40:49.791 --> 00:40:53.753]  You've got something made in America that's organic, that doesn't eat holes in your clothes.
[00:40:54.053 --> 00:40:58.916]  That doesn't burn your arms if you leave it under your armpits on accident, like the detergent soaps.
[00:40:59.177 --> 00:41:05.301]  You save money, and it's a family business, but of course people will never know, so they'll keep buying the toxic junk.
[00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:14.567]  Unfortunately, Procter, Lever, and Colgate monopolized not only the stores, but the airwaves, the TV screen, the radio, the billboards.
[00:41:14.887 --> 00:41:16.188]  That's pretty rough competition.
[00:41:16.248 --> 00:41:22.733]  Procter & Gamble last year did $50 billion worth of business, and they spent 10% of that,
[00:41:23.735 --> 00:41:24.516]  We're good to go.
[00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:59.814]  And you've really perked up the consumer to know they got something twice as good as what they're buying now, saving money, and now it's a pleasure to do their laundry, do their hair, wash their dishes.
[00:42:00.114 --> 00:42:01.214]  It isn't a chore!
[00:42:01.635 --> 00:42:02.735]  It feels good!
[00:42:03.197 --> 00:42:06.119]  And we're so happy to share that with your listeners.
[00:42:06.499 --> 00:42:07.920]  It's been wonderful, Alex.
[00:42:08.141 --> 00:42:11.363]  Well, I love exposing the fact that vaccines are full of mercury.
[00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:13.184]  I love exposing bad things.
[00:42:13.244 --> 00:42:16.066]  I love exposing good things to the public so they can learn about them.
[00:42:16.907 --> 00:42:24.412]  Marty, give folks the toll-free number so they can call and get a free brochure or catalog or so they can get the $14 sampler pack.
[00:42:24.732 --> 00:42:26.814]  Yes, the catalog is free.
[00:42:26.834 --> 00:42:29.616]  It's all the details of what we've got to offer.
[00:42:29.996 --> 00:42:30.136]  It's 1-800.
[00:42:33.992 --> 00:42:34.852]  340-7091.
[00:42:34.872 --> 00:42:46.175]  You can also see everything and pictures and color and information on the web which is 5starsoap.com or the 5, the letter or 5, the number 5starsoap.com
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.381]  And all the information is there.

[00:43:05.824 --> 00:43:09.005]  They don't call me Mr. Clean for nothing.
[00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:19.570]  1-800-340-7091 1-800-340-7091 or calbinpearsoap.com or you've even got a shorter website.
[00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:21.171]  It's 5starsoap.com?
[00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:21.831]  That's right.
[00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:22.831]  It's so simple.
[00:43:23.352 --> 00:43:24.452]  5starsoap.com.
[00:43:24.752 --> 00:43:32.616]  They can just get all the info immediately and we're so happy to share it not only with you, with your listeners, with your staff,
[00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:35.738]  It's an excitement every month to talk to you.
[00:43:36.169 --> 00:43:37.930]  And get the call from your listeners.
[00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.150]  It's unbelievable exciting.
[00:43:40.531 --> 00:43:47.653]  Well, you've got seafoam, dishcloth, bar soap, and then you've got, of course, the shampoo.
[00:43:48.093 --> 00:43:49.594]  You've just got so many different products.
[00:43:49.834 --> 00:43:58.417]  And you've also got special dispensers that then basically dilute it because it's triple concentrated.
[00:43:58.457 --> 00:44:04.479]  So you've even got your own systems to deliver it to make sure that people maximize their usage of it.
[00:44:04.699 --> 00:44:06.020]  Well, these are the four basics.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.882]  Laundry soap, bath soap, hair soap, and dish soap.
[00:44:10.102 --> 00:44:11.563]  And they'll do 200 jobs!
[00:44:11.904 --> 00:44:17.207]  You don't have to buy these floor cleaners, or window cleaners, or all-purpose cleaners, and all these chemicals and solvents.
[00:44:17.247 --> 00:44:19.288]  You've also got great lotion and hand cream.
[00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:21.750]  Right, those are little side items.
[00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:26.473]  A bottle of lotion, which is 16 ounces, you use one drop at a time.
[00:44:26.983 --> 00:44:29.864]  We don't get much reorders on it because it lasts forever.
[00:44:30.144 --> 00:44:53.695]  Now again, and this is my final point, but it's so important, we use it at my house, when you get a normal bottle of, quote, lotion, it's petrochemical based, there's 20 names on the back at the bare minimum that you can't even pronounce, uh, pronounce, uh, pronunciate, and, and, there I am saying I can't pronounce it, and I can't pronunciate pronunciation, and literally when you read the back of yours, it's just all natural things.
[00:44:53.755 --> 00:44:56.476]  It's just, it's just actual essential oils.
[00:44:56.876 --> 00:45:04.159]  Exactly, and this is what makes us popular and makes the people reorder, buy it again, and have a happy family.
[00:45:04.359 --> 00:45:09.881]  Let me give folks the number.
[00:45:10.001 --> 00:45:11.161]  It's 1-800-340-7091.
[00:45:11.181 --> 00:45:12.862]  1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com.
[00:45:13.062 --> 00:45:15.663]  We've got a banner on InfoWars.com if you missed the website.
[00:45:15.923 --> 00:45:17.343]  Marty, always great talking to you.
[00:45:17.704 --> 00:45:18.004]  Pleasure.
[00:45:18.024 --> 00:45:19.284]  Can I close with a limerick?
[00:45:19.404 --> 00:45:19.824]  Of course.
[00:45:21.265 --> 00:45:24.106]  There was a young fellow from Trinity.
[00:45:24.912 --> 00:45:35.036]  Who took the square root of infinity with a number of digits, gave him the fidgets, he dropped math, and took up divinity.
[00:45:36.756 --> 00:45:37.696]  Marty, good talking to you.
[00:45:37.716 --> 00:45:38.717]  We'll talk to you next month.
[00:45:39.177 --> 00:45:40.737]  In fact, I may get you up even sooner.
[00:45:41.158 --> 00:45:45.179]  Alright, I appreciate folks holding whenever, once a month, we have Marty on.
[00:45:45.239 --> 00:45:47.520]  Every couple weeks we have one other sponsor on.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.701]  And we do this because it's good products and it makes the broadcast.
[00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:57.386]  Yes, I just wanted to mention, aside from the independent forums on the web, I've been going into MySpace and I've actually touched bases with a fireman
[00:46:21.021 --> 00:46:37.771]  Who's aware of the truth and also a military member and he says that he meets on a regular basis with other members of the military and researches the information and he has assured me that he is willing and able to defend the Constitution when the time comes.
[00:46:38.472 --> 00:46:43.615]  Aside from that, I just wanted to say that I'm interested in getting into lobbying because I remember one time that you mentioned
[00:46:43.959 --> 00:46:45.880]  That lobbyists have a great effect on Congress.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:47:05.546]  I know that may be on a superficial level, but... Well, the reason those lobbyists have power is they've got massive money behind them from the corporations, but just to be citizen lobbyists, to educate, to inform, to go to events when your congressman's giving a speech, to stand up and demand that they address real issues, that does have an effect and we should all do it.
[00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:07.907]  Alex, I just have one question for you.
[00:47:09.347 --> 00:47:12.268]  My sister and I have been discussing this information and she asked me,
[00:47:12.748 --> 00:47:14.389]  To get your take on Lyndon LaRouche.
[00:47:15.989 --> 00:47:22.192]  I think that his assessment of the global oligarchy is very accurate when he looks at the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:47:22.612 --> 00:47:25.053]  I don't agree with his big government solutions.
[00:47:25.113 --> 00:47:25.974]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:26.774 --> 00:47:27.034]  You bet.
[00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:27.675]  Thank you, sir.
[00:47:28.815 --> 00:47:31.476]  Let's go ahead and talk to Marilyn in Missouri.
[00:47:31.536 --> 00:47:32.597]  Marilyn, thanks for holding.
[00:47:32.617 --> 00:47:33.037]  Go ahead.
[00:47:33.057 --> 00:47:34.698]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:35.358 --> 00:47:36.538]  You know, I woke up back in 1968.
[00:47:36.779 --> 00:47:42.221]  Then in the 80s, I served in elective office locally.
[00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:57.150]  I've watched this thing progress for so many years now, and I think it's so important that we emphasize that people need to take an interest in their local government.
[00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.950]  These things are coming right down to us on the local level.
[00:48:02.831 --> 00:48:05.831]  If we work, we can stop a lot of it.
[00:48:06.491 --> 00:48:10.892]  Here in my hometown, we've managed to stop them in years past.
[00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:19.330]  from a federal funded program to inspect every home in Independence.
[00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:20.731]  Look inside closets.
[00:48:21.631 --> 00:48:24.391]  We stopped that about two years ago.
[00:48:24.871 --> 00:48:28.272]  We stopped them from fluoridating our public water supply.
[00:48:28.292 --> 00:48:39.394]  So there are so many things that people who are watching the world scene and the federal level are missing at the local level.
[00:48:40.394 --> 00:48:40.954]  Right now,
[00:48:42.799 --> 00:48:54.623]  The federal funding coming into local police is, as you so well state, federalizing our local police, training them to be very cruel.
[00:48:57.464 --> 00:49:08.287]  These are things that average citizens can do something about if they just will take an interest in local government and work at the local level.
[00:49:08.747 --> 00:49:09.848]  Now, in that regard, I
[00:49:12.037 --> 00:49:15.880]  I have given some of your tapes to our local chief of police.
[00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:19.484]  At this point, he sort of, uh, rushes it off.
[00:49:20.284 --> 00:49:29.673]  But, um, I want to ask you, um, can you help me to get the order I placed back in October?
[00:49:30.674 --> 00:49:36.238]  On the 25th of October, I ordered three copies of Terror Storm and one copy of Russo's DVD.
[00:49:36.639 --> 00:49:39.021]  Went out and bought a DVD player so I could watch them.
[00:49:39.653 --> 00:49:40.713]  But I still haven't gotten them.
[00:49:58.325 --> 00:49:59.285]  Here at my office.
[00:49:59.965 --> 00:50:02.126]  And we will definitely get that out to you.
[00:50:02.146 --> 00:50:06.427]  But then there's also the problem of sometimes stuff gets taken in the mail.
[00:50:07.027 --> 00:50:09.508]  You know, there's just all sorts of things going on.
[00:50:09.808 --> 00:50:11.168]  We're not a big corporation.
[00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.608]  We don't ask for donations.
[00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:16.309]  And I appreciate everyone that supports us financially.
[00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:20.950]  And so if every once in a while we have a problem, please bear with us.
[00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.031]  And I want to apologize to you.
[00:50:25.044 --> 00:50:28.406]  That that happened, but we make every attempt that we can to get that done.
[00:50:28.446 --> 00:50:33.089]  But let me go back to the first thing that you brought up, and that's getting involved locally.
[00:50:34.569 --> 00:50:35.890]  That is so essential.
[00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:42.133]  We get 50-60% turnout in federal elections, national elections, and 8% on average.
[00:50:42.253 --> 00:50:45.235]  I saw the numbers here in Texas, and I think it's similar to that nationwide.
[00:50:45.835 --> 00:50:47.396]  And the real power is locally.
[00:50:48.217 --> 00:50:50.418]  That's where people can have an effect.
[00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:57.223]  So stay there, I'll give you this back line here in just a moment, and we'll track down what you're talking about.
[00:50:57.583 --> 00:50:58.684]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:51:01.765 --> 00:51:10.148]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.488 --> 00:51:18.111]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.826 --> 00:51:25.870]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:37.716]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.016 --> 00:51:41.538]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:43.900]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:48.082]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.286 --> 00:52:09.549]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.809 --> 00:52:14.150]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.451 --> 00:52:23.374]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.574 --> 00:52:27.175]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.475 --> 00:52:32.521]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.801 --> 00:52:39.548]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:40.029 --> 00:52:40.570]  What about you?
[00:52:41.312 --> 00:52:46.677]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:20.169 --> 00:53:20.630]  I think so.
[00:53:37.125 --> 00:53:37.385]  I think so.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.562]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:22.146 --> 00:54:31.630]  Speaking of documentary films and ordering them, you can get them from the beast itself, Amazon.com, and they will ship it out to you immediately.
[00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:33.671]  Just go to Infowars.com.
[00:54:34.151 --> 00:54:35.752]  We have a link to Amazon
[00:54:37.043 --> 00:54:38.884]  We're good to go.
[00:54:54.059 --> 00:55:13.884]  And more often than not with a problem, either a credit card didn't go through, about half the time we get a complaint about an order, it is, this must be the new show I guess, this is what I'll do here on air, because you know, I get one or two of these a week now, and this hasn't happened in years where we've had this problem, and I think it's because we had a big bump in orders for America Freedom to Fascism,
[00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:20.275]  And frankly, we're not the cat's meow when it comes to customer service, because it's a catch-22.
[00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:26.840]  We don't have the money for the staff here to do the best job of handling that.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:35.145]  Sometimes I think I'll just cease sales altogether and maybe have an outside group handle it, but then you've got to manage that and watch that.
[00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:38.828]  Then there's the question of, well, it costs so much, we just won't exist and just close our doors.
[00:55:39.759 --> 00:55:54.468]  I mean, yesterday I did three hours of radio, and I think I plugged my videos briefly twice, because even though they're such good films and so informative, and very effective against the globalists, I get to the point of where, you know, I just can't even operate.
[00:55:55.848 --> 00:55:59.611]  So, if you want to support us, if you want to donate to us, maybe we'll just do it the easy way.
[00:56:00.411 --> 00:56:08.656]  Maybe I'll just quit making films, I'll do the radio show, and you can send me checks, and just donate like other shows do it, and then support us that way.
[00:56:09.275 --> 00:56:10.355]  And then it'd be pretty easy.
[00:56:11.476 --> 00:56:14.316]  In fact, I'll just do it on air now because we do need your support.
[00:56:14.716 --> 00:56:18.277]  If you'd like to donate to us, I've never really done this, you can just go ahead and write us checks.
[00:56:19.177 --> 00:56:24.539]  Because there's a lot of things we'd like to do and like to be able to do, and we've just been unable to do it.
[00:56:25.339 --> 00:56:30.280]  If you really want to get down to brass tacks, if you want to donate to us, that'd be really great.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.601]  I like the type of donation where you just call up and buy 10-15 videos.
[00:56:35.712 --> 00:56:38.515]  You've heard all the callers call in who've gotten their films and made copies.
[00:56:38.915 --> 00:56:40.417]  We put it out for free on Google Video.
[00:56:40.437 --> 00:56:41.017]  I made a film.
[00:56:41.157 --> 00:56:43.740]  It cost me $100,000 to make, Terror Storm.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.721]  I put it out for free.
[00:56:45.501 --> 00:56:49.385]  Because the goal here is to get the information out to the people.
[00:56:50.166 --> 00:56:54.570]  So I'd say 95% of people do get their tapes within a week to two weeks.
[00:56:55.254 --> 00:56:55.734]  We're good to go.
[00:57:16.062 --> 00:57:24.245]  Or you can write to me, I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:57:25.106 --> 00:57:31.188]  Or you can order it via our Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart at infowars.com.
[00:57:31.768 --> 00:57:34.369]  And they're great films, they're informative, they're authorized.
[00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:35.530]  I ask you to make copies.
[00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:43.273]  And your purchase does make this broadcast and what we do possible.
[00:57:45.239 --> 00:57:47.480]  So please support us, my friends.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.681]  Please support the country.
[00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:51.762]  And also support our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:57:53.082 --> 00:57:57.084]  Get the names of the sponsors there.
[00:57:57.484 --> 00:57:58.665]  Support those sponsors.
[00:57:58.725 --> 00:58:01.386]  Tell people about the stations that carry the broadcast.
[00:58:02.246 --> 00:58:03.207]  And that's what you are doing.
[00:58:03.247 --> 00:58:05.288]  That's why the broadcast is exploding.
[00:58:06.268 --> 00:58:07.789]  And we are reaching more and more people.
[00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:12.871]  And we are having an effect on a wider and wider scale.
[00:58:13.843 --> 00:58:17.226]  Alright, we'll start the second hour here, Lord willing.
[00:58:18.167 --> 00:58:22.352]  And I want to get into Newt Gingrich saying we need to restrict free speech in America because free speech is bad.
[00:58:22.372 --> 00:58:28.818]  And we need to talk about what's happening with the economy and the existing home sales rises, prices fall.
[00:58:29.559 --> 00:58:32.922]  That is not good news for the economy.
[00:58:33.503 --> 00:58:34.404]  But we need to talk about it.
[00:58:35.104 --> 00:58:36.365]  We'll discuss it all on the other side.
[00:58:36.386 --> 00:58:36.766]  Stay with me.
[00:58:41.693 --> 00:58:46.795]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.875 --> 00:58:47.255]  Hello?
[00:58:47.275 --> 00:58:48.035]  Big Brother.
[00:58:48.055 --> 00:58:48.855]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:48.875 --> 00:58:51.756]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:51.836 --> 00:58:54.697]  You want answers?
[00:58:54.797 --> 00:58:56.877]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.974 --> 00:59:09.918]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.159 --> 00:59:14.283]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.207 --> 00:59:21.250]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:28.418]  And a lady called the last hour who brought up the central point in action against the New World Order.
[00:59:30.223 --> 00:59:39.492]  Every time I've gotten involved locally, every time I've seen citizens around the nation, in thousands of cases, really get involved locally, you can affect change.
[00:59:41.293 --> 00:59:42.534]  You can take action.
[00:59:43.335 --> 00:59:51.643]  And that's why the establishment is racing to put in these government-controlled, electronic, no-record voting machines, so they can frustrate the will of the people.
[00:59:52.845 --> 01:00:09.371]  The establishment sees the polls with 97% against toll roads on existing roads, 90% to 91% against open borders, 70-plus percent against the war, 99% against land-grabbing Supreme Court rulings.
[01:00:09.932 --> 01:00:17.715]  So they're racing to try to checkmate us and block us from being our own rulers, from controlling our society.
[01:00:18.175 --> 01:00:20.155]  You know, I bash the American people a lot.
[01:00:20.276 --> 01:00:21.276]  I bash myself a lot.
[01:00:22.261 --> 01:00:33.370]  I mean, you do have a big dumbed-down mass out there, but you've got millions, tens of millions, I'd say over 100 million people who are somewhat informed and do care, but they're blocked by this system.
[01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:38.234]  But locally, you can still have an effect.
[01:00:39.595 --> 01:00:42.337]  We've beaten gun bills that were, quote, sure to pass in Texas.
[01:00:42.817 --> 01:00:46.500]  We've beaten all sorts of land grabs, but it's when the people get involved.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:51.324]  So pick an issue, get informed, take action, get involved with other people,
[01:00:52.655 --> 01:00:56.496]  And again, I mean, I knew fraud was going on with the Local Access TV station.
[01:00:56.536 --> 01:00:57.857]  I knew they were trying to shut it down.
[01:00:58.257 --> 01:01:00.458]  I sued them and got some of their corporate minutes.
[01:01:01.218 --> 01:01:07.000]  And John Villarreal, the head of the place, was just sentenced to seven years in the Texas State Penitentiary.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.161]  And boy, they were threatening to sue me and call me a conspiracy terrorist.
[01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:15.783]  Well, in the end, he pled guilty to stealing $345,000 over the last five years from the people of Austin.
[01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:27.814]  And again, I had to go sue him, I had to go do it, and I'm just one person, and believe me, you could have done the same thing.
[01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:32.900]  I saw the signs, I saw the indicators, I looked at the math, it didn't add up, I went after him.
[01:01:34.721 --> 01:01:38.225]  Back in 2000, they were going to pass a bunch of gun laws restricting our Second Amendment.
[01:01:38.846 --> 01:01:42.550]  We went down there, we were just camped out at the Capitol, caught bribery on video.
[01:01:43.194 --> 01:01:44.515]  You know, God's on our side.
[01:01:44.595 --> 01:01:48.498]  I mean, every time we go out and do something, we expose the enemy.
[01:01:48.558 --> 01:01:50.959]  Everything we do, we have success.
[01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:53.641]  And if we don't have success the first time, we do it again.
[01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:56.423]  And if we have no hope of success, we do it again.
[01:01:56.743 --> 01:01:59.725]  Because you've got to do the right thing.
[01:02:00.806 --> 01:02:02.267]  You've got to take action.
[01:02:04.969 --> 01:02:06.310]  And that's what we're doing here.
[01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:08.191]  We're giving it our best shot.
[01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:09.652]  We're going to the wall here.
[01:02:09.772 --> 01:02:10.453]  We're going to the mat.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.760]  We'll get back from break.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.441]  I'm going to run through your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:18.461 --> 01:02:18.781]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:22.682]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[01:02:23.182 --> 01:02:26.503]  Newt Gingrich is out saying, well, we need to restrict the First Amendment.
[01:02:26.563 --> 01:02:29.303]  Free speech is kind of dangerous in the war on terror.
[01:02:29.643 --> 01:02:31.123]  Same thing's happening in England.
[01:02:32.084 --> 01:02:33.884]  We're hurting them is why they're doing this.
[01:02:33.944 --> 01:02:35.224]  We're having a success.
[01:02:35.984 --> 01:02:38.905]  You see, they know that we're aware of them now.
[01:02:38.985 --> 01:02:39.365]  They know.
[01:02:40.234 --> 01:02:43.597]  Also, I want to get more into what's happening with housing prices and the dollar and the economy.
[01:02:43.637 --> 01:02:46.199]  I also want to get into a bunch of Iraq news.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.443]  Meanwhile, the Drudge Report and the neocons are making fun of crying Iraqi women.
[01:02:52.404 --> 01:02:57.628]  And they're making a big joke about how one of the Iraqi women looks like George Bush.
[01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:01.331]  Just a sick joke, folks.
[01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:03.152]  I mean, that's what these sickos do.
[01:03:03.172 --> 01:03:08.517]  They have radio shows making fun of Club Gitmo, how wonderful Guantanamo Bay is.
[01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:13.011]  The rape rooms, which they do raping there too, that's been declassified.
[01:03:13.031 --> 01:03:16.811]  I mean, that's how sick it's gotten, so I want to get into that report.
[01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:20.012]  Also, we'll talk about Hugo Chavez, who I don't completely trust.
[01:03:21.692 --> 01:03:23.092]  I want to think he's a good guy.
[01:03:23.552 --> 01:03:29.033]  I see a lot of good indicators, but I want to break down when we'll learn if he's a good guy or a bad guy.
[01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:31.854]  Because he will reveal himself.
[01:03:33.494 --> 01:03:38.395]  So it's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:43.730]  And we're going to get to Ken, Ruth, Eric, and others.
[01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:48.681]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and JonesReport.com.
[01:03:48.702 --> 01:03:49.183]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.852 --> 01:03:57.292]  It's here!
[01:03:57.512 --> 01:04:02.295]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.655 --> 01:04:10.319]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.999 --> 01:04:18.043]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.443 --> 01:04:25.327]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:04:25.819 --> 01:04:29.861]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.181 --> 01:04:33.663]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.143 --> 01:04:36.064]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:40.327]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.732 --> 01:04:58.957]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:04:59.097 --> 01:05:07.186]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:14.513]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:05:14.633 --> 01:05:15.293]  We're good to go!
[01:05:41.732 --> 01:05:41.992]  I think?
[01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:56.250]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:58.532]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:58.672 --> 01:06:05.719]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:06:05.999 --> 01:06:14.507]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:06:53.339 --> 01:06:55.942]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.502 --> 01:06:59.245]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.115 --> 01:07:03.357]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:03.898 --> 01:07:12.786]  Newt Gingrich has gone public, and Sedgwick Bush and the rest of the neocons have been quietly broaching.
[01:07:13.686 --> 01:07:16.209]  Hey, we need to go ahead and arrest people for their speech.
[01:07:16.889 --> 01:07:19.071]  We need to go ahead and restrict newspaper speech.
[01:07:20.372 --> 01:07:21.774]  Don't criticize the government.
[01:07:22.214 --> 01:07:23.195]  We're in a war!
[01:07:23.795 --> 01:07:25.517]  Yeah, an elite war against the people.
[01:07:26.198 --> 01:07:27.299]  It's not about left and right.
[01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:28.239]  It's about the elite.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.220]  It's about the state.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.141]  It's about the government.
[01:07:30.181 --> 01:07:32.623]  It's about the corporations against the people.
[01:07:34.304 --> 01:07:37.146]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken.
[01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:39.347]  And Ken, where are you calling us from today, sir?
[01:07:39.367 --> 01:07:40.768]  I'm calling from Virginia.
[01:07:40.868 --> 01:07:42.610]  Three things, Alex.
[01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:52.456]  The terrorist storm has been promoted in a Virginia Taxpayers Association news release sent around the country both by U.S.
[01:07:52.517 --> 01:07:53.057]  mail and
[01:07:53.690 --> 01:08:00.555]  And a postal service, and it mentioned both Infowars.com and Amazon.com.
[01:08:00.635 --> 01:08:01.175]  Oh, great!
[01:08:01.455 --> 01:08:16.465]  Number two, which is yesterday on the local call-in show in Virginia, WSBA Harrisonburg, I called in regarding Virgil Goode and the North American Union.
[01:08:16.545 --> 01:08:21.288]  He has introduced, he's our Republican from the 5th District in Virginia.
[01:08:22.824 --> 01:08:24.566]  He's part of the Liberty Committee with Ron Paul.
[01:08:41.025 --> 01:08:45.788]  He will not mention the North American... He talks about immigration.
[01:08:46.128 --> 01:08:48.549]  He talks about maybe putting soldiers on the border.
[01:08:48.849 --> 01:08:53.872]  He will not talk about the North American Union or the NAFTA superhighway.
[01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:58.794]  He's probably had the party tell him that you're not going to get a committee chairmanship if you ever do that.
[01:08:58.995 --> 01:09:04.838]  He's a member of the House Appropriations Committee and he's scared of being too critical of Bush.
[01:09:05.318 --> 01:09:09.220]  And he also, of course, voted for this terrible military
[01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:16.490]  Commission's bill, which makes me a potential... See, I wasn't aware of that.
[01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:18.252]  Ron Paul was saying he was a pretty good guy.
[01:09:18.672 --> 01:09:20.113]  I mean, I want to vouch for him.
[01:09:20.153 --> 01:09:24.697]  He came on this show and said the North American Union is horrible, the New World Order is horrible.
[01:09:25.097 --> 01:09:25.297]  Right.
[01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:31.682]  And then it's sad to hear that he's buckling... He said it on your show because it's a friendly source.
[01:09:32.122 --> 01:09:38.247]  And he is the best, having said what I said, he is the best congressman we've got in Virginia, which doesn't say that much.
[01:09:38.746 --> 01:09:51.016]  He still is, and I've known him on a first-name basis, but he won't even put it in his weekly news report about his own resolution.
[01:09:51.036 --> 01:09:58.642]  He won't promote his own resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 487, and that's subject for criticism.
[01:09:58.702 --> 01:10:04.066]  Now think how far we've come down the rat hole, that Lou Dobbs will talk about it, Human Events will talk about it.
[01:10:04.606 --> 01:10:08.009]  Major newspapers will discuss it, but it's still somewhat of a public secret.
[01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:11.111]  We've openly been signed into a North American Union.
[01:10:11.491 --> 01:10:19.197]  The private corporation that is the District of Columbia, that's taken over our entire country, and our banking system, has signed deals to merge us.
[01:10:19.477 --> 01:10:20.978]  They're merging us now.
[01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:24.320]  They're handing over the roads to foreign companies and countries.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:28.523]  It's all happening, but, oh, you're not supposed to talk about it!
[01:10:28.563 --> 01:10:29.564]  I mean, this is pathetic!
[01:10:30.379 --> 01:10:30.579]  Right.
[01:10:30.619 --> 01:10:42.656]  Now the last thing that I want to talk about, the most immediate, regarding this morning's article that Philip Silico is going to resign from the State Department, where he's been counselor.
[01:10:42.716 --> 01:10:48.103]  Condoleezza Rice appointed him to this very high post and very influential, and the story was that
[01:10:48.673 --> 01:10:49.153]  I don't know.
[01:11:07.634 --> 01:11:11.818]  He deliberately omitted some of the most important things.
[01:11:11.898 --> 01:11:14.680]  And he was also involved with PNAC.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.702]  He's a very dangerous person.
[01:11:16.822 --> 01:11:17.082]  Right.
[01:11:18.663 --> 01:11:31.994]  And so I said on the radio this morning, Harrisonburg WSVA, the local call-in show I called in, said he should be tried for mis-prison of felony or mis-prison
[01:11:33.677 --> 01:11:34.198]  Of course.
[01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:48.901]  And this, of course, is a felony and that he should be tried and subject to be put in jail.
[01:11:48.981 --> 01:11:57.645]  By the way, even the 9-11 Commission, while saber-rattling, posing, said they were considering calling for criminal charges against members of the Pentagon for lying.
[01:11:58.006 --> 01:12:04.549]  Well, I mean, if they're going to send somebody from the Pentagon to jail for covering up 9-11, quote, prior knowledge, it's much worse than that.
[01:12:04.769 --> 01:12:08.831]  Then the whole Commission should go to prison, including its chief staffer, Zelikow.
[01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:09.652]  Right.
[01:12:09.752 --> 01:12:11.174]  And he is the key person.
[01:12:11.234 --> 01:12:23.150]  Now, I also went to... I said, now, of course, under the present administration with Alberto Gonzales, he would not... they would not do anything, so they should have a special counsel for him.
[01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:26.134]  And this just came on, and I said,
[01:12:26.596 --> 01:12:34.362]  Of course, one of the things that they concealed was the heroic deeds of William Rodriguez and all the explosions which he heard.
[01:12:34.782 --> 01:12:40.347]  And he was, uh, they got him on testimony under oath for at least two hours and a half.
[01:12:40.787 --> 01:12:50.334]  And after I said that, and I was going to go on building number seven, but they cut me off before because of the station that I don't want to hear about.
[01:12:50.414 --> 01:12:53.597]  I was going to go on to building seven, which was in essence,
[01:12:54.091 --> 01:13:07.268]  Although it was leased by Larry Silverstein, in essence it was a government building with all the government agencies, and I was going to talk about that, but I was not able to do it this morning, but I intended to get on it again tomorrow.
[01:13:07.308 --> 01:13:10.472]  Well, hey, listen, good job, good to hear from you, you keep it up.
[01:13:11.395 --> 01:13:12.415]  I really appreciate it.
[01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:15.816]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ruth in Pennsylvania.
[01:13:15.837 --> 01:13:16.717]  Thanks for holding, Ruth.
[01:13:17.157 --> 01:13:17.397]  Hi.
[01:13:17.757 --> 01:13:21.638]  When you started the show, you'd ask people to call in about their police state stories.
[01:13:21.818 --> 01:13:22.379]  Yes.
[01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:23.699]  A caller actually called.
[01:13:23.719 --> 01:13:25.520]  It was something I wanted to be a topic.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.020]  Thank you.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.181]  This is about the Dormant Police Department, which is just outside the city of Pittsburgh.
[01:13:31.602 --> 01:13:36.023]  And I'm a single... A few details here are important to understanding how this happened.
[01:13:36.474 --> 01:13:39.836]  I'm a single female, and I'm the youngest child living with two elderly parents.
[01:13:39.936 --> 01:13:43.998]  I'm their sole caretaker, and I'm the only family they have in town.
[01:13:44.979 --> 01:13:49.021]  I live in one of the worst police department areas in the whole county.
[01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:50.542]  It has a horrible reputation.
[01:13:51.303 --> 01:13:57.246]  I live next to a very volatile neighbor who has aggressed upon my elderly parents and I for years.
[01:13:57.306 --> 01:14:00.048]  We're talking more than 10 years this has been going on.
[01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:05.191]  I can't go, not enough time to go into all the details, but the police, along with this
[01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:10.284]  The damage has been the death of my elderly father who was blind and crippled.
[01:14:10.644 --> 01:14:11.044]  Excuse me.
[01:14:11.244 --> 01:14:12.545]  Excuse me.
[01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:14.727]  It led to his heart attack.
[01:14:15.307 --> 01:14:16.068]  I'm having trouble.
[01:14:16.188 --> 01:14:18.229]  When I start talking about it, it might get a little choked up.
[01:14:18.749 --> 01:14:24.553]  But their violence and aggression that went on for an hour one day led to his heart attack.
[01:14:24.954 --> 01:14:29.977]  He had a really horrible death, a downhill slide, and he died much earlier than he should have.
[01:14:30.362 --> 01:14:32.344]  On that same day they killed my German Shepherd.
[01:14:32.604 --> 01:14:33.184]  Excuse me.
[01:14:33.625 --> 01:14:33.945]  Dog.
[01:14:33.965 --> 01:14:35.966]  This happened years ago and I still can't talk about it.
[01:14:37.387 --> 01:14:42.411]  Recently... Oh yeah, the cops come by for a 911 call or a disturbance call.
[01:14:43.032 --> 01:14:46.274]  It is policy to kill any dog that's barking at them.
[01:14:46.735 --> 01:14:49.697]  And they've shot dogs as small as... They didn't shoot them.
[01:14:49.717 --> 01:14:51.378]  They've shot dogs as small as corgis.
[01:14:51.679 --> 01:14:52.419]  I'm just telling you.
[01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:57.163]  I've been to houses where right next to a baby's crib they shoot a lab five times in the head.
[01:14:57.623 --> 01:15:07.871]  My dog had just had abdominal surgery the day before, and because of the yelling and screaming, it ran into the house and did three belly flops, and I've been asking the officer to please help me get the dog in the house.
[01:15:08.311 --> 01:15:14.796]  It just got out of surgery, and the cop didn't help me, and the yelling went on, and my dog bled to death in front of me.
[01:15:16.107 --> 01:15:18.308]  Um, recently this neighbor tried to... Ma'am, that's nothing.
[01:15:18.348 --> 01:15:21.989]  I mean, a lot of times they just taser you for no reason or beat you upside the head with a belly club.
[01:15:22.469 --> 01:15:25.130]  Well, they put... We don't do anything here.
[01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:26.031]  We're law-abiding.
[01:15:27.151 --> 01:15:29.172]  Nothing... It's all been aggression coming our way.
[01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:29.992]  Well, sure, sure.
[01:15:30.012 --> 01:15:31.613]  Well, not according to this society.
[01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:34.994]  We're all criminals, and then they're all good.
[01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:39.856]  But statistically, actually, there are higher rates of criminality in government agents, period.
[01:15:40.396 --> 01:15:41.537]  And again, that's all official.
[01:15:41.877 --> 01:15:42.997]  But still, it doesn't matter.
[01:15:43.177 --> 01:15:44.157]  We're all bad.
[01:15:44.298 --> 01:15:45.178]  They're good.
[01:15:46.684 --> 01:15:47.425]  It goes like this.
[01:15:47.445 --> 01:15:51.427]  Elites, politicians, police, illegal aliens, U.S.
[01:15:51.467 --> 01:15:51.928]  citizens.
[01:15:52.488 --> 01:15:54.389]  We're on the bottom of the totem pole.
[01:15:56.371 --> 01:15:57.552]  Yeah, I do.
[01:15:57.692 --> 01:16:01.214]  I mean, I've never seen anything like this in my life.
[01:16:01.234 --> 01:16:02.255]  I've lived other places.
[01:16:02.295 --> 01:16:03.716]  This one town is one of the worst.
[01:16:03.756 --> 01:16:07.178]  And they brought in the Justice Department to clean up, Pittsburgh Police Department.
[01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:08.419]  I remember that, yeah.
[01:16:08.459 --> 01:16:09.340]  My elderly mother
[01:16:10.393 --> 01:16:11.334]  We're good to go.
[01:16:28.013 --> 01:16:29.555]  These are who these bullies target.
[01:16:29.595 --> 01:16:31.316]  They target kids, teenagers.
[01:16:31.356 --> 01:16:32.317]  They beat them up.
[01:16:32.357 --> 01:16:38.223]  We have something called the Goon Squad here, a subset of the police department known for beating kids up.
[01:16:38.423 --> 01:16:39.624]  No, ma'am, I understand.
[01:16:39.685 --> 01:16:40.645]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:42.127 --> 01:16:47.332]  Again, through every society in history, the police always either are bad from the start or go bad.
[01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:59.542]  Because you get thugs in these organizations and they start kicking out the good cops and then the system wants to cover up so it just gets worse and worse and worse until it gets so bad the whole system just falls apart.
[01:17:00.523 --> 01:17:04.967]  And that's why there's so many propaganda shows worshipping the police, making excuses for them.
[01:17:05.348 --> 01:17:06.689]  Methinks you protest too much.
[01:17:06.729 --> 01:17:11.794]  They're doing this because the killings and the murders and the drug dealing and the prostitution running
[01:17:12.745 --> 01:17:21.372]  And all the crazy corruption is coming out, and so the media and the government is just constantly propagandizing, trying to keep a lid on it.
[01:17:22.493 --> 01:17:28.658]  And it's sad because there are so many good police, and people in government period, that they don't deserve that bad name.
[01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:38.165]  But they get the bad name because the system itself is designed and thuggery is promoted and supported.
[01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:41.147]  And I know you could go on for hours, ma'am.
[01:17:41.308 --> 01:17:43.569]  I certainly can imagine that this is pretty bad.
[01:17:43.589 --> 01:17:51.015]  It's just there's no way to tell a lifetime in two or three minutes, but I'm glad that you crawled in with your story.
[01:17:52.516 --> 01:18:01.402]  I mean, I remember city officials sending a letter to my grandfather saying, you'll get these huge fines every day if you don't clean out the government ditch behind your house.
[01:18:02.023 --> 01:18:02.943]  It wasn't his property.
[01:18:05.703 --> 01:18:07.444]  He didn't tell me they were getting threatened.
[01:18:07.524 --> 01:18:09.284]  I guess they didn't want to bother the family.
[01:18:10.705 --> 01:18:12.766]  I wish families would bother their family members.
[01:18:12.926 --> 01:18:15.767]  I understand the stoicness of not telling your family.
[01:18:16.227 --> 01:18:20.349]  And he was 70-something years old and pretty sedentary.
[01:18:20.389 --> 01:18:26.071]  And he climbed over the fence and removed all these big logs and debris and had a heart attack right after that that then led to his long slide.
[01:18:27.472 --> 01:18:32.174]  And of course I've been all over houses all over the town where they were taking old people's houses where they target the old.
[01:18:32.194 --> 01:18:33.114]  They've got a list of them.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:42.291]  And then a lot of times the old people can't clean out the ditch, or the government, or they can't even mow their own yard, so then they take the house and the local mafia divvies it up.
[01:18:44.354 --> 01:18:46.056]  But again, who cares about our old people?
[01:18:46.076 --> 01:18:48.760]  Let's just lick the boots of whoever's in a black uniform.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.523]  We'll be right back with more of your calls and a ton of news.
[01:18:51.543 --> 01:18:51.904]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.846 --> 01:18:54.947]  Ted Anderson from Midas.
[01:18:55.047 --> 01:18:55.548]  It's November 28, 2006.
[01:18:55.608 --> 01:18:59.712]  Golds at $638.90 and 1 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $659.83, $331.50 per half, and $166.24 for quarter ounce coins.
[01:18:59.752 --> 01:19:00.173]  That's $659.83, $331.50, and $166.24.
[01:19:12.646 --> 01:19:25.717]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[01:19:25.837 --> 01:19:29.080]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:32.622]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:35.705]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[01:19:35.965 --> 01:19:38.846]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[01:19:38.926 --> 01:19:39.366]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.446 --> 01:19:44.227]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[01:19:44.387 --> 01:19:46.747]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:47.447 --> 01:19:53.309]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.469 --> 01:19:56.889]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.490 --> 01:20:03.431]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:10.379]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[01:20:10.779 --> 01:20:22.514]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:31.262]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:55.960]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.801]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:20:58.222 --> 01:20:58.462]  What?
[01:20:58.822 --> 01:20:59.202]  Again?
[01:20:59.603 --> 01:21:01.244]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:21:01.304 --> 01:21:05.726]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:21:05.967 --> 01:21:07.247]  Why did you do that?
[01:21:07.467 --> 01:21:13.271]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:21:13.551 --> 01:21:14.572]  Are we there yet?
[01:21:14.692 --> 01:21:15.753]  for the entire trip.
[01:21:15.993 --> 01:21:18.214]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:21:18.675 --> 01:21:19.695]  Great idea.
[01:21:19.715 --> 01:21:22.557]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[01:21:22.924 --> 01:21:25.389]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[01:21:25.589 --> 01:21:29.978]  And using our Bertie Sport bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:21:30.258 --> 01:21:30.579]  Honey!
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.641]  You're terrific!
[01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.522]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[01:21:34.622 --> 01:21:38.045]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:21:38.325 --> 01:21:39.106]  Now, can we stop?
[01:21:39.606 --> 01:21:40.347]  I need to go, too.
[01:21:40.647 --> 01:21:45.090]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.751]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:21:53.973 --> 01:21:54.533]  Hey Emily!
[01:21:54.813 --> 01:21:55.714]  Wow, you look great!
[01:21:56.054 --> 01:21:56.854]  I feel great!
[01:21:57.115 --> 01:21:59.056]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[01:21:59.416 --> 01:21:59.716]  Really?
[01:21:59.956 --> 01:22:00.356]  What is it?
[01:22:00.496 --> 01:22:00.957]  How does it work?
[01:22:01.097 --> 01:22:07.540]  Well, MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from the body.
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:09.921]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[01:22:10.101 --> 01:22:15.224]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[01:22:15.524 --> 01:22:16.004]  That's it?
[01:22:16.305 --> 01:22:17.845]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[01:22:18.046 --> 01:22:18.746]  It is easy.
[01:22:18.946 --> 01:22:25.590]  Plus, the FDA says Flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:27.191]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[01:22:27.411 --> 01:22:28.191]  That's amazing!
[01:22:28.512 --> 01:22:33.875]  And, the Benzonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:34.435]  Wow!
[01:22:34.615 --> 01:22:35.676]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[01:22:36.116 --> 01:22:39.140]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:43.106]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.

[01:22:47.091 --> 01:22:47.312]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:23:03.424 --> 01:23:13.730]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls in this segment, then I want to get into Newt Gingrich saying we need to restrict free speech in America, what's developing with the economy, and I'd like to get calls from you on those subjects.
[01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:15.911]  It's pretty darn important.
[01:23:17.032 --> 01:23:20.014]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric in New York.
[01:23:20.114 --> 01:23:21.154]  Eric, thank you for holding.
[01:23:21.194 --> 01:23:21.554]  Welcome.
[01:23:22.255 --> 01:23:22.695]  Hi, Alex.
[01:23:22.715 --> 01:23:23.235]  How you doing?
[01:23:23.335 --> 01:23:23.816]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:23:24.316 --> 01:23:26.277]  God bless all you do.
[01:23:26.537 --> 01:23:31.080]  Yesterday's show, which I think was a refeed, specialized on the police state.
[01:23:31.687 --> 01:23:32.888]  No, I was live yesterday.
[01:23:33.268 --> 01:23:34.409]  Oh, that was live?
[01:23:34.789 --> 01:23:35.069]  Yes.
[01:23:35.329 --> 01:23:36.030]  Okay, okay.
[01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:43.154]  Um, well, back around 1996, 97, or around 20 years ago now, I was out driving around 10 p.m.
[01:23:43.194 --> 01:23:45.736]  at night here in upstate, in Syracuse, New York.
[01:23:46.336 --> 01:23:50.118]  A car slowly crossed the center line, the yellow line, to pass me.
[01:23:50.138 --> 01:23:52.060]  You know, she obviously broke the law.
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.361]  So I slowed down to let the car pass me.
[01:23:54.941 --> 01:24:00.705]  All of a sudden, all sorts of Syracuse police surrounded this car, guns drawn,
[01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:09.955]  And the thugs ran to the driver's door, opened the door, and yanked a woman who must have been at least 85 years old out of the car.
[01:24:11.336 --> 01:24:13.277]  They probably yanked her shoulder out of the socket.
[01:24:13.337 --> 01:24:15.118]  It was sickening to see, Alex.
[01:24:16.019 --> 01:24:17.180]  I've seen that myself.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.041]  In fact, I forget his name.
[01:24:19.081 --> 01:24:25.966]  He was a former prosecutor in a pretty good-sized town in far west Texas.
[01:24:25.986 --> 01:24:27.487]  I've interviewed him twice.
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:30.902]  I want to say it's barber, but it was big news in Texas.
[01:24:32.163 --> 01:24:49.217]  And he was the former prosecutor, and he said he got so sick of watching the state police getting people on Sunday going from church, making them all get outside the car, everything spread out on the side of the highway, and then he'd watch as they made old ladies, and this is when he was the prosecutor.
[01:24:49.824 --> 01:24:57.934]  He would stop his car and get out, and then the cops would run over to him and get in his face, making old ladies put everything back in their car.
[01:24:58.415 --> 01:25:01.538]  Let me tell you, cops, you ever search my car, you're putting it back in.
[01:25:02.019 --> 01:25:02.420]  Okay?
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.784]  And so, it's just incredible.
[01:25:06.588 --> 01:25:12.110]  So, on his own ranch property, he put a big sign saying, there is a Fourth Amendment, say no to searches.
[01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:19.193]  They sued him, went to the state, and made him take the billboard down off his own property.
[01:25:19.213 --> 01:25:21.253]  Oh, God.
[01:25:21.293 --> 01:25:22.214]  Yeah, his name was Barber.
[01:25:23.214 --> 01:25:28.656]  So, I mean, again, that's somebody who was, and of course, he had just, he had retired from being prosecutor.
[01:25:29.317 --> 01:25:33.402]  So again, proving everybody in government isn't bad, and he just got sick of watching it.
[01:25:33.422 --> 01:25:35.424]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[01:25:35.725 --> 01:25:39.630]  Yeah, it just made me so disgusted to witness this.
[01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:40.711]  Unfortunately, I had no...
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.100]  Nothing to defend this old woman at the time.
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.041]  Well, see, that's the thing.
[01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:50.841]  Remember when they passed the federal seat belt law and people said, well, it wasn't federal.
[01:25:51.181 --> 01:25:53.562]  Yeah, they told the states it was a federal law.
[01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.642]  You don't get any highway funds unless you pass it.
[01:25:56.682 --> 01:25:59.883]  So it's a federal unfunded mandate.
[01:26:00.863 --> 01:26:02.583]  I guess you could say it is a funded mandate.
[01:26:03.103 --> 01:26:07.804]  And so they came in and then they promised, oh, but we really won't arrest you or give you tickets.
[01:26:07.824 --> 01:26:08.644]  It'll just be warnings.
[01:26:09.124 --> 01:26:11.925]  Well, the famous case outside Austin, Texas, Lago Vista,
[01:26:13.266 --> 01:26:14.907]  Wife of a prominent doctor.
[01:26:15.447 --> 01:26:16.387]  No criminal record.
[01:26:16.447 --> 01:26:17.788]  She never had a ticket.
[01:26:17.828 --> 01:26:18.528]  That was in the news.
[01:26:19.108 --> 01:26:25.110]  And in their enclosed neighborhood in Lago Vista, they stopped at the communal mailbox to get their mail.
[01:26:25.650 --> 01:26:33.593]  She didn't put her seatbelt back on because she was literally 50 yards, just a few houses from her home.
[01:26:34.213 --> 01:26:36.554]  The cops pull over, start screaming at her.
[01:26:36.934 --> 01:26:38.174]  He takes her to jail.
[01:26:38.974 --> 01:26:42.976]  The CPS come and take the kids, because if you're one parent in the car, they take the kids.
[01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:44.896]  Then they interrogate them and try to find dirt.
[01:26:44.916 --> 01:26:46.857]  I mean, this isn't America, it's the Soviet Union.
[01:26:47.357 --> 01:26:50.858]  Then the husband started suing them, going on TV, going on radio.
[01:26:51.418 --> 01:26:57.200]  Then they claim they got a call from the house, which these are on like five-acre ranchettes out there on the lake.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.480]  They show up,
[01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:00.205]  I don't think so.
[01:27:18.883 --> 01:27:20.004]  Named, uh, what was her name?
[01:27:20.024 --> 01:27:20.744]  Named Gracie.
[01:27:21.625 --> 01:27:24.106]  And, uh, I guess she was about 60 years old at the time.
[01:27:24.586 --> 01:27:26.027]  She owned three houses.
[01:27:26.047 --> 01:27:30.709]  Uh, it was in, uh, just down the road from where Willie Nelson used to live.
[01:27:30.749 --> 01:27:33.551]  He moved, saying, quote, Texas is a police state.
[01:27:33.651 --> 01:27:35.132]  They ran Willie Nelson out.
[01:27:35.612 --> 01:27:38.013]  Willie, it's pretty close to Willie Nelson's place.
[01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:46.998]  They shot down the whole street, searched the whole neighborhood, and she described the same female SWAT commander we keep hearing about, uh, here in Travis County.
[01:27:47.638 --> 01:27:51.541]  Ordering around all these roid heads, making her sit in an ant bed.
[01:27:52.582 --> 01:27:59.187]  Their little dog, who I met, might have weighed 25 pounds, growled, and so they started kicking it, stomping it, and laughing.
[01:28:00.488 --> 01:28:04.931]  They went into a renter's house, pulled out a Playboy magazine, were going looky at what he reads.
[01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:05.812]  I've interviewed her.
[01:28:05.852 --> 01:28:08.173]  I've got a video interview, a TV show.
[01:28:08.233 --> 01:28:11.496]  I ought to dig that out and put that on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:11.516 --> 01:28:12.637]  We've been doing some of that lately.
[01:28:12.717 --> 01:28:14.418]  I've taken old shows and put them on.
[01:28:14.818 --> 01:28:15.579]  The point is,
[01:28:16.179 --> 01:28:28.244]  Is that, is that, they said she was wearing sleeveless camo with big red fingernails, with blonde hair all tied back, she's the brood chief, with all these, you know, uh, satyr males around her.
[01:28:28.524 --> 01:28:29.925]  These people are trash!
[01:28:31.025 --> 01:28:36.488]  And then I found out the same lady pulled over, somebody I know, was screaming and yelling at him going, you got a problem boy?
[01:28:36.928 --> 01:28:39.369]  I'll get you out and bang your head in the wall!
[01:28:44.139 --> 01:28:47.129]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.072 --> 01:28:50.780]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:57.064]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[01:28:57.584 --> 01:29:00.907]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[01:29:01.267 --> 01:29:04.229]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[01:29:04.490 --> 01:29:10.875]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[01:29:10.935 --> 01:29:15.358]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[01:29:15.578 --> 01:29:19.940]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[01:29:20.101 --> 01:29:22.702]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[01:29:22.742 --> 01:29:25.503]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[01:29:25.964 --> 01:29:28.505]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[01:29:28.545 --> 01:29:32.807]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[01:29:32.847 --> 01:29:33.688]  Treasury bonds.
[01:29:33.988 --> 01:29:38.593]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.

[01:30:53.749 --> 01:30:57.731]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:30:57.951 --> 01:31:01.493]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:31:01.773 --> 01:31:05.855]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:31:06.135 --> 01:31:07.075]  I was so amazed.
[01:31:07.315 --> 01:31:10.176]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:31:10.337 --> 01:31:12.237]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:31:12.618 --> 01:31:17.800]  SoliWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:24.184]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan Salt.
[01:31:24.464 --> 01:31:26.186]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:31:26.446 --> 01:31:29.608]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:31:29.808 --> 01:31:33.711]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:31:33.971 --> 01:31:35.432]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:31:35.772 --> 01:31:40.914]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.

[01:31:44.935 --> 01:31:45.896]  We don't need no education.
[01:32:03.523 --> 01:32:22.439]  Yeah, I've got to dig out that old TV report from... It's got to be like 1999 here in Austin.
[01:32:24.001 --> 01:32:26.263]  Because then Margo Fraser, the big...
[01:32:28.306 --> 01:32:29.047]  I'm not going to say it.
[01:32:29.087 --> 01:32:30.207]  Just a horrible creature.
[01:32:30.928 --> 01:32:32.009]  Sheriff that she was.
[01:32:32.609 --> 01:32:35.031]  Got up on local ABC News.
[01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:35.851]  I've got the clip.
[01:32:37.373 --> 01:32:38.974]  That's why I've got to find that old TV show.
[01:32:40.014 --> 01:32:41.235]  And I'll extract it and play it here.
[01:32:41.255 --> 01:32:44.678]  And she said, well, we don't have to have warrants anymore.
[01:32:44.738 --> 01:32:45.959]  Things have changed.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.601]  I mean, word for word.
[01:32:51.523 --> 01:32:55.365]  She said, well, well, there's been complaints that we didn't have warrants to search the neighborhood.
[01:32:55.946 --> 01:32:57.627]  We don't need warrants anymore.
[01:32:58.763 --> 01:32:59.824]  Oh, and what was their excuse?
[01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:01.845]  There's a thing called blood weed.
[01:33:02.666 --> 01:33:07.550]  That if you've got any more than a quarter acre that hasn't been mowed, you will get blood weed growing on it.
[01:33:09.912 --> 01:33:11.813]  Looks nothing like marijuana.
[01:33:11.953 --> 01:33:16.136]  It's big, wide, you know, V-style leaves.
[01:33:17.898 --> 01:33:22.481]  And so for the TV report I did, I went out and showed behind every gas station, by the police station.
[01:33:23.002 --> 01:33:24.763]  I drove around, a lot of you probably saw it.
[01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:28.651]  And showed all the blood weed everywhere!
[01:33:29.872 --> 01:33:35.976]  At schools, so there's some blood weed behind her house so they blocked the street and searched the entire street.
[01:33:37.417 --> 01:33:39.398]  And we were interviewing her because she's the one that complained.
[01:33:39.418 --> 01:33:47.524]  She owned a couple acres and she had her house and two other rent houses and her husband was a pretty famous country singer.
[01:33:50.646 --> 01:33:51.847]  I gotta go interview her again.
[01:33:51.887 --> 01:33:54.729]  All she did was talk about her hubby, her deceased hubby.
[01:33:56.511 --> 01:34:07.378]  But uh, but I mean imagine weird thugs running around giggling with Playboy magazines going, lookie what we what you like to look at.
[01:34:09.159 --> 01:34:15.983]  And then stomping a dog with some weird blonde lady with long red fingernails with a machine gun running around.
[01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:19.611]  Don't you have a warrant?
[01:34:19.651 --> 01:34:21.632]  We don't need no stinking warrants!
[01:34:22.453 --> 01:34:22.813]  Literally!
[01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:27.656]  And then the sheriff gets up on TV and says, we no longer need warrants.
[01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.679]  Their minds are completely warped.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.461]  They think they're God.
[01:34:38.263 --> 01:34:42.946]  So once you get me started with police state stories, I mean, how many times, how many times on the TV show?
[01:34:43.026 --> 01:34:48.170]  Back in the day when I just did, you know, a local radio show and a one TV show a week, I put a lot into that TV show.
[01:34:48.797 --> 01:34:49.758]  I keep saying this.
[01:34:50.178 --> 01:34:51.999]  Mike has most of them in a storage shed.
[01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:57.283]  I've got some that have been in my garage so long they probably don't even work anymore.
[01:34:57.323 --> 01:34:58.324]  Old three quarter inch tapes.
[01:34:58.744 --> 01:34:59.725]  Mike, I know you're listening.
[01:34:59.785 --> 01:35:02.647]  Next Monday for the TV show I want you to just bring me all the tapes you got.
[01:35:03.107 --> 01:35:03.747]  Or dig through them.
[01:35:03.807 --> 01:35:05.969]  Every special, every program we did.
[01:35:06.069 --> 01:35:06.869]  All the good stuff.
[01:35:06.909 --> 01:35:07.450]  You remember.
[01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:09.611]  I want to get those on the internet.
[01:35:09.631 --> 01:35:11.933]  Because those are a treasure trove.
[01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:26.764]  I mean, they had SWAT raids out in the country, where we'd go to old people's houses, cancer survivors' houses, people, and, and, and, you know, these are just really nice little country people, and they'd say, they blocked off the road.
[01:35:27.264 --> 01:35:35.886]  And then they searched every house, they screamed and put the gun to my head, and my husband said, please don't, so they hit him with a gun in the face.
[01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:39.767]  It's Task Force Number 13, they're the ones.
[01:35:40.287 --> 01:35:42.848]  The Army was with them, the choppers was in the air.
[01:35:43.624 --> 01:35:48.268]  You're talking to these old Germans that live in like houses with two foot thick rock walls.
[01:35:49.128 --> 01:35:51.810]  And I mean, these people don't even drink most of the time.
[01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:59.116]  I mean, you talk about hillbillies and they're just like, and they told us they was gonna find marijuana and they wanted the ranch.
[01:36:00.117 --> 01:36:04.020]  My great-granddaddy built it and they want my ranch.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.501]  I ain't gonna give it.
[01:36:05.581 --> 01:36:07.142]  I mean, I've got it all on tape.
[01:36:07.623 --> 01:36:09.104]  How do you do stuff like that?
[01:36:09.144 --> 01:36:10.445]  You're just a bunch of criminals.
[01:36:12.893 --> 01:36:15.414]  And the cops a lot of times get that land for themselves personally.
[01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:19.835]  You see, a lot of them don't just take money from the mafia or criminal groups who deal drugs.
[01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:28.537]  A lot of them on these narcotics task forces and stuff now work it out where they go get the auction that nobody got told about.
[01:36:29.017 --> 01:36:31.437]  So they're all driving around in $50,000 Corvettes living in $500,000 million houses.
[01:36:36.047 --> 01:36:38.748]  They've all got their own little personal pieces of property.
[01:36:38.768 --> 01:36:46.352]  In fact, I remember growing up, there was an FBI agent that lived down the hill from us, and we lived in a, you know, upper middle class neighborhood with a golf course and all that stuff.
[01:36:46.372 --> 01:36:47.893]  My dad was an, you know, oral surgeon, dentist.
[01:36:49.534 --> 01:36:50.975]  And it was this big house.
[01:36:52.335 --> 01:36:55.937]  And a, and a, and a quote, retired FBI agent lived in it.
[01:36:56.477 --> 01:37:01.980]  And, and it later came out that he'd been involved in the drug raid on the house right before he retired.
[01:37:02.681 --> 01:37:05.162]  And he drove the big brand new Corvette.
[01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:09.476]  I mean, I'm tired of it!
[01:37:10.256 --> 01:37:12.016]  Who died and made you God?
[01:37:17.118 --> 01:37:18.179]  So I'm not your slave.
[01:37:19.699 --> 01:37:29.202]  And frankly, if police are twice as likely to be involved in crime, you deserve for us to sit here and talk about you like this, even if most of you aren't criminals.
[01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:36.805]  I mean, even if they're twice as likely, it doesn't mean that many of them are criminals, but it's still a large portion at the higher levels.
[01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:42.830]  Your average beat cop is probably a nice person, if they're not some mental patient who likes to bully people.
[01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:43.611]  You got those.
[01:37:44.251 --> 01:37:50.392]  But corruption is in the detectives, the vice squads, and it's simple.
[01:37:50.512 --> 01:37:53.893]  I mean, you know, going back a hundred years, the corruption just continues.
[01:37:54.553 --> 01:38:03.475]  Back from when they were raiding brothels a hundred years ago, and the madam would say, man, you don't need to take us all to jail.
[01:38:03.515 --> 01:38:05.556]  Why don't you just treat yourselves?
[01:38:06.565 --> 01:38:13.208]  And pretty soon, the cops learn, hey, we'll just take over and start pimping these women and we'll start demanding a cut.
[01:38:14.529 --> 01:38:17.771]  And it's well known in almost every major city, the police run the whores.
[01:38:18.831 --> 01:38:21.693]  They constantly get arrested here in Austin for running the whores.
[01:38:24.674 --> 01:38:32.619]  Because, you know, they're sitting there around all these good looking women and these women, you know, they'll just go, well, I won't bust you if you go ahead and just have sex with me.
[01:38:32.979 --> 01:38:35.180]  And then the next thing it leads to, they're pimps.
[01:38:37.273 --> 01:38:38.034]  And you know what?
[01:38:38.114 --> 01:38:40.455]  I don't use your narcotics your bosses ship in.
[01:38:41.036 --> 01:38:45.359]  I don't break your stupid laws that you're passing so many of, it's almost impossible not to.
[01:38:48.181 --> 01:38:51.863]  So don't sit up there all high and mighty.
[01:38:51.883 --> 01:39:01.350]  You know how you're the guardians and you're the heroes and we've got to learn to give you proper respect when you treat us all like criminals.
[01:39:02.446 --> 01:39:12.754]  I mean, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, despite the fact that your industry, your revenue collection business, has a horrible reputation and history.
[01:39:13.975 --> 01:39:20.600]  And all your PR, and all your propaganda, and all the PSAs aren't going to cover that up.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.601]  You can't put perfume on a pig.
[01:39:23.782 --> 01:39:25.924]  That's a double entendre pun, isn't it?
[01:39:30.543 --> 01:39:36.626]  You know, the saying is, can't put perfume on a pig, and as soon as I said it, I realized that the nickname for bad police is pigs.
[01:39:37.126 --> 01:39:37.786]  Not intended.
[01:39:41.208 --> 01:39:46.830]  So... I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:55.554]  I mean, police, do you want your children, your sons and daughters, growing up in a society run by a bunch of thugs... Do you want to live like they do in Mexico?
[01:39:56.846 --> 01:40:07.849]  Where it was corrupt from the day the Aztecs and the Mayans set up shop and it got to a whole new level when they merged the corrupt Conquistador Spanish culture with it.
[01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:12.130]  And I mean just look at it today.
[01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:14.591]  The people can't get up out of the ditch.
[01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:16.191]  You got a tiny elite.
[01:40:18.052 --> 01:40:20.273]  Cops, you ever watch cops in Mexico?
[01:40:20.593 --> 01:40:21.973]  You think our police are arrogant.
[01:40:22.975 --> 01:40:24.075]  You can tell a good cop.
[01:40:24.415 --> 01:40:28.177]  You see a lot of these good cops, they kind of got sad looks on their faces.
[01:40:28.617 --> 01:40:30.497]  They're just real professional and quiet.
[01:40:31.498 --> 01:40:38.440]  I don't want to use the proper term.
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:41.061]  I was going to call them the derogatory name for a donkey.
[01:40:43.239 --> 01:40:45.840]  But you can just see it because they know.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.301]  They know there's a lot of embarrassing behavior, a lot of bad behavior.
[01:40:49.341 --> 01:40:50.582]  They're trying to be professional.
[01:40:50.982 --> 01:40:51.982]  This is their career.
[01:40:52.602 --> 01:40:55.343]  And then you can just see the arrogant control freak types.
[01:40:55.723 --> 01:41:00.365]  And then you can see the criminal types who just keep quiet and got this nice little front going.
[01:41:00.665 --> 01:41:02.986]  You know, they're the executive branch of this whole thing.
[01:41:04.666 --> 01:41:05.866]  And don't think we're stupid.
[01:41:05.906 --> 01:41:09.167]  Don't think we don't see the opulence you're living in.
[01:41:09.448 --> 01:41:10.528]  Don't think we're dumb.
[01:41:11.804 --> 01:41:13.565]  Don't think we don't know you're on the take.
[01:41:14.646 --> 01:41:17.008]  Don't think we're all stupid like the general public.
[01:41:17.668 --> 01:41:19.009]  And don't think it for 10 seconds.
[01:41:19.249 --> 01:41:27.255]  So don't you pull me over and ask to search my car and basically mutilate my Bill of Rights that I love in front of me.
[01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:30.257]  You swore an oath to that, you fool!
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:34.743]  I mean, sometimes the cops will say, can I search your car?
[01:41:34.763 --> 01:41:38.567]  And I go, no, you swore an oath to not violate the Bill of Rights.
[01:41:39.068 --> 01:41:40.950]  Do you respect that oath?
[01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:42.952]  I mean, do you think solemn oaths are important?
[01:41:44.954 --> 01:41:47.517]  I've never sworn an oath to protect it.
[01:41:47.557 --> 01:41:50.581]  I protect it because it makes sense and it's the bedrock of this country.
[01:41:50.621 --> 01:41:52.203]  It's what makes America, America.
[01:41:54.761 --> 01:42:18.175]  You know, I get teary-eyed when they sing the National Anthem, and when Old Glory's flying in the wind, not because I love the red, white, and blue colors, but because it signifies my forefathers that fought and died in the Revolutionary War, and that fought and died in the war for Texas independence, and that fought and died in all these other wars.
[01:42:18.496 --> 01:42:20.617]  You disgrace them!
[01:42:22.438 --> 01:42:23.799]  Sure, World War II was
[01:42:25.282 --> 01:42:26.043]  Concocted.
[01:42:26.343 --> 01:42:27.204]  Hitler was funded.
[01:42:27.764 --> 01:42:29.086]  But he was a real threat.
[01:42:29.126 --> 01:42:30.587]  The last real war we had.
[01:42:31.028 --> 01:42:34.831]  And you know, both my grandfathers stomped off to volunteer and be in that war.
[01:42:36.413 --> 01:42:38.054]  As many of your grandparents did.
[01:42:42.038 --> 01:42:42.899]  I'm already digressing.
[01:42:42.939 --> 01:42:43.760]  I said I'd get to the news.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:45.101]  I'll go back to your calls in a moment.
[01:42:46.662 --> 01:42:50.266]  The big news I'll recap before I get into the other news I haven't covered yet is
[01:42:51.719 --> 01:43:13.851]  France is panicking in particular because it's going to be so bad for their economy to have a strong euro that they're asking the central bank over there to not increase interest rates which will encourage other central banks and other private investors to buy euros because the euro is now 50 cents to the dollar more valuable.
[01:43:15.532 --> 01:43:15.832]  Okay?
[01:43:17.178 --> 01:43:20.600]  50 cents more value in the Euro.
[01:43:21.001 --> 01:43:38.111]  It's now risen to an all-time high against the dollar, and the Financial Times says that all of the currency experts are very concerned, and all they ever say is, it's a prerequisite that the dollar's going into the dustbin of history.
[01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:49.497]  But they said they want to control that slide so that elite corporations and central banks can have time to position their assets.
[01:43:50.577 --> 01:44:04.342]  I mean, this is so dangerous for the economy and for everybody's pocketbook, from the poorest to the most wealthy, that they are very concerned, saying, well, the plan is to tank the dollar, but this is happening too quick.
[01:44:06.952 --> 01:44:27.507]  And the plan, again, this has all been stated by the Trilateralists who set the world economic course, the strategia, that they're going to bring the dollar down, implode the economy, and then say, oh, we need to merge into a Pan-American Union with an Amaro to rival the Euro.
[01:44:27.587 --> 01:44:29.088]  Then they're going to have currency spikes
[01:44:30.146 --> 01:44:34.889]  And crashes and, quote, volatility in the market.
[01:44:34.909 --> 01:44:52.361]  And then the answer will be hedging the three world currencies, the Asian, the European, and the North American slash Pan American Union, Amero, into a world index and just setting their value.
[01:44:52.621 --> 01:44:54.783]  And then all the third world countries will have to follow suit.
[01:44:58.011 --> 01:45:09.477]  And by tanking the dollar, again the globalists aren't free market, they're about monopolies, wrecking markets, wrecking farmers, wrecking ranchers, wrecking industry, wrecking factories, consolidating.
[01:45:09.757 --> 01:45:17.581]  It's not about making a good product or even quote making money at the end of the day because the private banks
[01:45:18.101 --> 01:45:18.181]  Okay.
[01:45:47.026 --> 01:45:51.689]  Next story is one I mentioned yesterday but didn't detail.
[01:45:51.729 --> 01:45:53.010]  This is of the London Guardian.
[01:45:54.351 --> 01:45:58.753]  Police want power to crack down on offensive demonstrations, chants, and slogans.
[01:46:00.494 --> 01:46:03.737]  Present curbs are too light, meant chief to tell goldsmith.
[01:46:03.877 --> 01:46:07.559]  Rights groups say officers won't be, would be, censors in chief.
[01:46:09.835 --> 01:46:14.318]  Now already, if you spit or you drop a piece of paper, they have special little squads that arrest you.
[01:46:14.678 --> 01:46:16.299]  Now they're calling it unsocial behavior.
[01:46:16.339 --> 01:46:20.482]  So they're now saying shouting or saying rude things you can't do.
[01:46:20.542 --> 01:46:23.224]  And they come up and tell you to stop when you're even speaking on the street there.
[01:46:23.244 --> 01:46:23.964]  I've had it happen to me.
[01:46:24.224 --> 01:46:25.285]  You've seen it in Terror Storm.
[01:46:28.147 --> 01:46:32.490]  And so all over Europe, Canada, and now the U.S.
[01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:34.131]  are trying to pass the Hate Crimes Law.
[01:46:34.791 --> 01:46:36.692]  They're saying they've got to restrict speech.
[01:46:36.732 --> 01:46:39.354]  And I saw some Fox News TV show I was sent.
[01:46:41.036 --> 01:46:43.478]  Everybody's telling me that the character is based on myself.
[01:46:43.638 --> 01:46:49.403]  I don't know if it really is, but he just gets people to demonstrate, and demonstrating could cause a riot.
[01:46:49.783 --> 01:46:53.486]  A crowd of people could cause a riot, and so they go ahead and arrest him.
[01:46:53.546 --> 01:46:57.290]  Not for a riot, but for getting a demonstration going, because it's unauthorized.
[01:46:57.310 --> 01:47:01.173]  And again, it's not in the free speech zone, so it's terrorist.
[01:47:01.193 --> 01:47:06.217]  See, they're not just trying to pass the laws, they're showing you on TV that this is normal and good.
[01:47:08.194 --> 01:47:18.389]  Police are to demand, because see they're the boss, new powers to arrest protesters for causing offenses through the words that they chant, and the slogans on their placards, and even headbands.
[01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:23.737]  The country's biggest force, the Metropolitan Police, is to lobby the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith.
[01:47:24.057 --> 01:47:24.518]  The Lord!
[01:47:25.248 --> 01:47:30.015]  Because officers believe the large sections of the population have become increasingly politicized.
[01:47:30.315 --> 01:47:37.585]  You see, they're openly saying, we're angry, we're aware, and there is a growing sense that the current restrictions on demonstrations are too light.
[01:47:38.046 --> 01:47:39.929]  You see, they're saying, we're going to take over.
[01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:42.012]  They're saying, same thing here.
[01:47:42.592 --> 01:47:47.214]  Now, it goes on to say they'll have to pre-approve the speeches, the chants, and the placards.
[01:47:47.614 --> 01:47:49.075]  You'll have to get it approved through them.
[01:47:49.115 --> 01:47:49.975]  It goes on to say that.
[01:47:50.055 --> 01:47:50.336]  Now see?
[01:47:50.736 --> 01:47:52.737]  Openly approving your speech before you have it.
[01:47:53.057 --> 01:47:54.357]  First it's a free speech zone.
[01:47:54.437 --> 01:47:55.918]  Then it's we've got to approve your speech.
[01:47:56.218 --> 01:48:00.840]  Then there's a cop there with a sheet and you've got to follow your speech exactly.
[01:48:01.901 --> 01:48:02.621]  Oh yeah, that's freedom.
[01:48:03.982 --> 01:48:07.643]  Gingrich raises alarm at an event honoring those who stand up for freedom of speech.
[01:48:08.244 --> 01:48:10.745]  So he goes to this famous free speech event and this is what he said.
[01:48:13.158 --> 01:48:14.119]  Out of the Union Leader.
[01:48:14.139 --> 01:48:14.959]  See?
[01:48:33.348 --> 01:48:40.094]  We will need to get ahead of the curve before we actually lose a city, which I think could happen in the next decade as they bring in record numbers of foreigners.
[01:48:40.434 --> 01:48:44.598]  As I said, they're going to have the illegals riot, burn a bunch of cities, and then say free speech is banned.
[01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:45.219]  You watch.
[01:48:45.979 --> 01:48:46.880]  I know their program.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:47.821]  I know their mind.
[01:48:48.902 --> 01:48:51.164]  If you study them 18 hours a day, you will know their mind.
[01:48:51.624 --> 01:48:58.871]  We need to get ahead of the curve before we actually lose a city, which I think could happen in the next decade, said Genrich, a Republican who helped engineer the GOP's takeover in 1994.
[01:49:00.214 --> 01:49:10.980]  Ginnrich spoke to 400 state and local power brokers last night at the annual Knackley S. Loeb First Amendment Award Dinner, which supports people and organizations that stand up for freedom of speech.
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:26.168]  Ginnrich sharply criticized campaign finance laws, and he goes on, Last night's event held at the Radisson Hotel Center of New Hampshire honored a Lakes Region newspaper and a former Speaker of the House for work in favor of free speech.
[01:49:28.055 --> 01:49:33.539]  And then he goes on to the actual quotes here about how we need to restrict it and not let people criticize the government.
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:36.762]  They're not playing games.
[01:49:38.723 --> 01:49:46.349]  And folks, even cops that believe in free speech will follow orders when the time comes to arrest you for your speech.
[01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:49.572]  Land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[01:49:57.029 --> 01:49:57.469]  It's here!
[01:49:57.689 --> 01:50:02.451]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.851 --> 01:50:10.513]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.173 --> 01:50:18.236]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.636 --> 01:50:25.498]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:30.053]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.353 --> 01:50:33.976]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.336 --> 01:50:36.237]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.597 --> 01:50:40.520]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:06.578 --> 01:51:21.141]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:51:21.181 --> 01:51:21.501]  government.

[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:18.448]  Three years ago, before William Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, died, it was in the Associated Press that he went to a national meeting in Virginia of federal and state judges.
[01:53:18.508 --> 01:53:20.910]  It said that hundreds were in attendance.
[01:53:21.891 --> 01:53:23.912]  We read the quotes over and over again on air.
[01:53:23.972 --> 01:53:24.813]  I can paraphrase them.
[01:53:24.833 --> 01:53:26.314]  I don't remember their exact text.
[01:53:26.934 --> 01:53:28.635]  But it was basically, and he said it.
[01:53:28.876 --> 01:53:29.916]  I mean, he did say it.
[01:53:29.956 --> 01:53:31.438]  I'm paraphrasing, but it's very close.
[01:53:31.798 --> 01:53:33.319]  I can go pull it, I guess, and re-read it.
[01:53:34.562 --> 01:53:36.543]  But I just thought about it, you know, coming in from the break.
[01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:46.407]  He just said, well, in the war on terror, we need to just not worry about the Constitution and go ahead and start ruling against it while the nation's at war.
[01:53:49.129 --> 01:53:50.169]  And what have we now seen?
[01:53:50.329 --> 01:53:52.190]  I mean, they did abolish the Bill of Rights.
[01:53:54.331 --> 01:53:57.553]  MSNBC reported nine of the ten, really the entire ten.
[01:53:59.593 --> 01:54:02.955]  And the Democrats have no intention of repealing any of it.
[01:54:03.914 --> 01:54:08.416]  There's no discussion of it, and they're now adopting all those powers.
[01:54:09.256 --> 01:54:13.037]  And they want to pass total blanket amnesty as a guest worker program.
[01:54:13.278 --> 01:54:15.558]  They want to pass the restrictive hate crimes law.
[01:54:16.479 --> 01:54:20.220]  They now want to come back with a bunch of gun control, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
[01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:25.722]  And even White House officials have said, well, now we can work with the Democrats on immigration and other issues.
[01:54:27.463 --> 01:54:30.224]  And Bush has said that he, quote, may sign a hate bill.
[01:54:31.405 --> 01:54:35.268]  It's like he signed campaign finance reform that restricted free speech.
[01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:39.911]  Tries to dictate who we can interview on this show!
[01:54:43.013 --> 01:54:46.156]  Just an off-topic issue here.
[01:54:46.176 --> 01:54:50.679]  This is out of Melbourne, Australia, the Rambo granny.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:58.545]  Two thugs raped her 18-year-old granddaughter, so she went with a shotgun
[01:54:59.432 --> 01:54:59.952]  I don't know.
[01:55:15.794 --> 01:55:17.655]  Teach those individuals.
[01:55:18.436 --> 01:55:20.357]  We will get to your phone calls the next hour.
[01:55:20.437 --> 01:55:31.965]  I've got a guest coming up, but only for about 15-20 minutes to talk about the Wesley Snipes income tax case and where the collection agency of the private Federal Reserve stands right now.
[01:55:33.205 --> 01:55:38.469]  Before I end this hour, I really would like to encourage all of you to support this broadcast.

[01:55:57.227 --> 01:56:00.349]  But spread that link around to everyone you know.

[01:56:43.810 --> 01:56:47.852]  So do your shopping today and support those that tell the truth and get the word out.

[01:57:16.971 --> 01:57:19.553]  And by the way, we had a lady call in the last hour asking about our order.
[01:57:20.986 --> 01:57:22.346]  It's always the toll-free line.
[01:57:22.486 --> 01:57:24.947]  Have them read back your credit card number to you.
[01:57:25.007 --> 01:57:31.829]  Make sure they got it down right, because usually the problem is people's order doesn't go through, because we get your number wrong.
[01:57:33.689 --> 01:57:38.350]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.083 --> 01:57:54.265]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.926 --> 01:57:55.746]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.486 --> 01:57:57.387]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.407 --> 01:58:01.849]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.249 --> 01:58:06.371]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.272 --> 01:58:15.076]  The tax advisor that gave Wesley Schnaipp the advice that now got the feds after him,
[01:58:17.081 --> 01:58:19.490]  He got grabbed in Latin America.
[01:58:19.791 --> 01:58:22.401]  They wouldn't extradite, so our government just went down and kidnapped him.
[01:58:24.494 --> 01:58:26.655]  We'll be telling you that story coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:26.695 --> 01:58:28.676]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:58:29.136 --> 01:58:33.418]  Let's go to Joey Wisconsin, then Linda, Andrew, Greg, Patrick, and others.
[01:58:33.458 --> 01:58:34.479]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:58:34.939 --> 01:58:36.459]  Hello, fellow thought criminal.
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:38.540]  I've got a police state example for you.
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:39.021]  Sure.
[01:58:39.461 --> 01:58:43.142]  They're not trying to restrict my speech, they're just trying to restrict me.
[01:58:43.162 --> 01:58:48.545]  I've called in before about the way that university has been turning a cold shoulder to me.
[01:58:49.025 --> 01:58:53.167]  Despite the fact that I've represented the school at NASA as an engineer,
[01:58:53.925 --> 01:59:02.794]  They seem to turn a blind eye to that and say, well, we need to take care of you, because I do talk about all things that you bring up and whatnot.
[01:59:03.274 --> 01:59:06.417]  But this has just come to me in the past two weeks.
[01:59:06.878 --> 01:59:10.381]  The campus lieutenant gave orders to harass me.
[01:59:10.962 --> 01:59:14.445]  And the direct inference came from a Sergeant JS Bach.
[01:59:15.126 --> 01:59:17.368]  And I said, well, who's been telling you to do this?
[01:59:17.668 --> 01:59:18.509]  Oh, my lieutenant did.
[01:59:19.079 --> 01:59:21.802]  Well, you know what you're doing could be misconstrued as harassment.
[01:59:21.822 --> 01:59:23.163]  He says, I don't care.
[01:59:23.183 --> 01:59:24.504]  Oh, okay.
[01:59:24.544 --> 01:59:25.405]  This is really cute.
[01:59:26.146 --> 01:59:35.135]  So anyway, I just had an officer walk up to me and inform me maybe 10 minutes ago that, oh, guess who's in trouble again?
[01:59:35.155 --> 01:59:36.336]  I'm like, ah, great.
[01:59:37.045 --> 01:59:39.986]  But what I wanted to say... Well, I mean, let me guess.
[01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:46.429]  You go around handing out flyers around the school, you speak to people, and so now they're trying to tell you not to do that?
[01:59:46.809 --> 01:59:53.171]  Well, what I've been doing is using the Internet resources, which are Internet 2, which is public-supported.
[01:59:53.391 --> 01:59:55.852]  There was $2 million cut for two of our schools.
[01:59:55.912 --> 01:59:57.813]  Yeah, that's a super high-powered private internet.
[01:59:57.833 --> 01:59:58.193]  Oh, yeah!
[01:59:58.573 --> 01:59:59.634]  And it works very well.
[01:59:59.774 --> 02:00:01.455]  However, it's not supposed to work for me.
[02:00:01.555 --> 02:00:02.455]  Now, here's the rub.
[02:00:02.935 --> 02:00:03.535]  As of 12.05 Central,
[02:00:05.704 --> 02:00:08.804]  No one else has been singled out because I stopped the guy and I said, hey!
[02:00:09.218 --> 02:00:11.739]  Are they bugging you about using your internet access?
[02:00:11.799 --> 02:00:13.740]  He says, no, they haven't said anything to me.
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:14.640]  They just walk right past me.
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:26.384]  So wait a minute, just like with a 10 year old kid here in Austin who got in trouble for visiting my site at school because he's a terrorist, they're now flagging what you're viewing and then approaching you?
[02:00:26.764 --> 02:00:27.304]  No, no, no.
[02:00:27.904 --> 02:00:32.106]  It's because I interact with people and they just start making things up.
[02:00:32.146 --> 02:00:36.407]  Have you ever played a game as a kid with a cheater who keeps rewriting the rules as they go on?
[02:00:36.908 --> 02:00:38.048]  First they were saying that
[02:00:38.524 --> 02:00:47.489]  I'm intimidating other people from using the resources and whatever, and when that turned out to be yes, well... So basically you're engaging in a thought crime of talking to each other.
[02:00:47.509 --> 02:00:51.131]  You're supposed to go home, watch TV, talk to no one, have no interaction.
[02:00:51.731 --> 02:00:52.791]  Well, not even that.
[02:00:53.112 --> 02:00:58.494]  It's more like an indignant whoever says, how dare you use resources I paid for?
[02:00:58.554 --> 02:00:59.615]  Well, I paid for those too.
[02:01:00.191 --> 02:01:04.713]  And I'd like to have some representation along with my taxation.
[02:01:05.013 --> 02:01:07.033]  And it seems like... So what are they telling you?
[02:01:07.073 --> 02:01:09.194]  Don't use the library computers?
[02:01:09.474 --> 02:01:10.975]  No, no, it's not even the library.
[02:01:11.015 --> 02:01:12.855]  They got rid of that a long time ago.
[02:01:13.035 --> 02:01:21.138]  They're just saying that the publicly available terminals I am not supposed to use because their primary use is for people who are currently paying tuition.
[02:01:21.478 --> 02:01:29.061]  Never mind that I've paid boatloads in the past and I'll be signing up again as a regular enrolled student, but
[02:01:29.696 --> 02:01:32.198]  But I can go down to UT and use their computers.
[02:01:32.498 --> 02:01:34.719]  They're just saying you can't use them at your university?
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:42.465]  Well, what they've done is they've said because I am intimidating or some such nonsense that I'm not allowed to use them.
[02:01:42.485 --> 02:01:43.746]  Yeah, no judge, no jury.
[02:01:43.786 --> 02:01:47.008]  They can't arrest you, but they make an arbitrary determination.
[02:01:47.048 --> 02:01:48.249]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:01:48.289 --> 02:01:48.829]  Gotta jump.
[02:01:48.869 --> 02:01:50.750]  Let's try to cram one more in.
[02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:52.091]  Let's talk to Linda in Texas.
[02:01:52.131 --> 02:01:52.712]  Go ahead, Linda.
[02:01:53.212 --> 02:01:56.274]  Hi, I was just hearing you talk about the police state
[02:01:57.037 --> 02:02:01.119]  I'm one of the warrior grannies, and you talked about the Rambo granny in Australia?
[02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:03.080]  Well, we're about that here.
[02:02:04.141 --> 02:02:05.622]  We get stopped every day.
[02:02:06.362 --> 02:02:07.503]  Every day we're on the highway.
[02:02:09.044 --> 02:02:10.285]  Why do you get stopped every day?
[02:02:10.525 --> 02:02:14.967]  Well, we're riding in an RV that's got a lot of things painted on it that shouldn't be, I guess.
[02:02:15.067 --> 02:02:23.332]  One policeman told us that we were actually breaking the law by having one of our logos on it, and the logo was, Honk if you speak English.
[02:02:25.001 --> 02:02:26.263]  Stay there, I want to hear about this.
[02:02:26.343 --> 02:02:29.348]  Oh yeah, they're all teaching them to be commissariat.
[02:02:29.388 --> 02:02:39.083]  That's political police officers who will mind us and harass us and let us know how to be good little slaves in the land of the slaves, home of the morons.
[02:02:49.068 --> 02:02:49.508]  It's here!
[02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:54.512]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.873 --> 02:03:02.539]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:03.219 --> 02:03:10.265]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.665 --> 02:03:17.511]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:03:18.038 --> 02:03:22.101]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.402 --> 02:03:26.065]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.365 --> 02:03:28.306]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.627 --> 02:03:32.550]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.808 --> 02:03:46.569]  Terrorism!
[02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:47.469]  Terrorism!
[02:03:47.569 --> 02:03:53.654]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:03:53.894 --> 02:03:55.495]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:03:55.735 --> 02:03:58.217]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:58.597 --> 02:04:13.167]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:13.207 --> 02:04:13.528]  government.
[02:04:13.708 --> 02:04:15.509]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:15.869 --> 02:04:21.794]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:21.914 --> 02:04:26.418]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:04:45.188 --> 02:04:49.230]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:04:49.450 --> 02:04:52.851]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:04:53.031 --> 02:04:56.453]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:04:56.764 --> 02:05:00.005]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:05:00.025 --> 02:05:05.508]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:05:05.528 --> 02:05:15.172]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:05:15.292 --> 02:05:16.673]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:05:16.693 --> 02:05:22.075]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:05:22.575 --> 02:05:27.018]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:05:27.098 --> 02:05:28.459]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[02:05:45.538 --> 02:05:50.561]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.941 --> 02:05:53.242]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:03.328 --> 02:06:07.190]  And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with J.R.
[02:06:07.291 --> 02:06:07.891]  Williamson.
[02:06:09.429 --> 02:06:17.855]  He, of course, is Associate of Tax Guru Eddie Cain, who currently was assisting actor Wesley Snipes with his IRS prosecution.
[02:06:18.875 --> 02:06:20.937]  And Cain was seized, kidnapped.
[02:06:22.338 --> 02:06:23.959]  Spelled Cahn, pronounced Cain.
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:29.643]  And we're going to tell you that story and tell you the latest developments with Wesley Snipes.
[02:06:31.559 --> 02:06:37.727]  Who I got a chance to, he's friends with Aaron Russo, been over to his house, watched Freedom to Fascism, The Rough Cut.
[02:06:38.188 --> 02:06:46.158]  Got, surprise, surprise, another patriot Hollywood person, knows all about the New World Order, and he's in Africa right now finishing up a film and can't come back to the U.S.
[02:06:46.198 --> 02:06:49.262]  because the IRS wants to make an example of him and arrest him!
[02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:52.344]  So we'll be talking to J.R.
[02:06:52.384 --> 02:06:54.244]  Williamson here in just a moment.
[02:06:54.624 --> 02:06:57.385]  Before we do that, finishing up with Linda in Texas.
[02:06:57.405 --> 02:07:11.569]  You say you drive around with your RV that's got slogans, Patriot slogans on it, and you get pulled over every day and the police have told you that it's illegal to have a sign that says honk if you speak English or something along those lines.
[02:07:12.490 --> 02:07:17.071]  Describe what this is like when you speak to commissariat police, political police officers.
[02:07:17.631 --> 02:07:18.571]  Well, I'm an old lady.
[02:07:18.651 --> 02:07:20.412]  I'm 65 years old.
[02:07:21.261 --> 02:07:22.621]  And I'm very polite to them.
[02:07:22.661 --> 02:07:23.602]  I'm very nice to them.
[02:07:24.342 --> 02:07:25.882]  And they usually respond that way.
[02:07:26.463 --> 02:07:28.983]  And I explain to them, I have a right to say what I want to say.
[02:07:29.003 --> 02:07:30.264]  And that is freedom of speech.
[02:07:30.304 --> 02:07:32.184]  So they don't understand free speech.
[02:07:32.244 --> 02:07:35.025]  They're being taught by the ADL this is illegal.
[02:07:35.425 --> 02:07:35.785]  Oh yeah.
[02:07:36.646 --> 02:07:46.989]  I know when we just came from Richmond, Virginia, where we protested the USDA up there against, they raided a guy's farm and killed all of his pigs.
[02:07:47.129 --> 02:07:48.829]  And it was on all the news shows.
[02:07:49.570 --> 02:07:50.810]  So we decided, well, we're
[02:07:51.294 --> 02:07:53.396]  Going up there and we'll protest the USDA.
[02:07:53.776 --> 02:07:54.998]  When I got all my permits.
[02:07:55.698 --> 02:07:56.859]  We got a parking permit.
[02:07:56.879 --> 02:07:58.982]  Again, gotta get permits now to protest.
[02:07:59.022 --> 02:08:00.943]  Well, yeah.
[02:08:01.023 --> 02:08:05.188]  Which a permit is an authorization to do something that's deemed illegal.
[02:08:05.368 --> 02:08:05.648]  Right.
[02:08:05.868 --> 02:08:08.030]  So see, it's illegal to protest in America now.
[02:08:08.391 --> 02:08:11.674]  Well, we were going to protest and I wanted to make sure we had all the
[02:08:12.873 --> 02:08:14.434]  All the ammunition we could.
[02:08:14.635 --> 02:08:16.456]  And really they use it as ammunition against you.
[02:08:16.476 --> 02:08:18.957]  I just go protest and I say, go ahead and arrest me.
[02:08:18.977 --> 02:08:19.658]  You can beat the rep.
[02:08:19.698 --> 02:08:20.438]  You can't beat the rod.
[02:08:20.478 --> 02:08:21.619]  I'm going to sue you.
[02:08:21.639 --> 02:08:22.340]  There you go.
[02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:24.281]  Well, we don't have the money to sue.
[02:08:24.921 --> 02:08:36.169]  Anyway, we get up there and they were supposed to have bagged four parking spaces for our motorhome to park in, in front of the Superior Court building.
[02:08:36.849 --> 02:08:38.930]  And it's right around the corner from the USDA office.
[02:08:39.331 --> 02:08:39.791]  Well, there were no
[02:08:40.191 --> 02:08:41.652]  Bags on any of the parking meters.
[02:08:41.692 --> 02:08:42.992]  In fact, there were no parking meters.
[02:08:43.413 --> 02:08:44.513]  And it was all no parking.
[02:08:44.593 --> 02:08:46.494]  So I figured, oh Lord, they've got us, you know?
[02:08:47.234 --> 02:08:49.075]  And I called the dispatcher.
[02:08:49.095 --> 02:08:49.315]  I called 911.
[02:08:49.415 --> 02:08:52.017]  I told them, I said, look, we have a permit to park.
[02:08:52.597 --> 02:08:53.958]  We have a permit to protest.
[02:08:54.678 --> 02:08:56.059]  And I'm staying right where I am.
[02:08:56.099 --> 02:08:56.979]  And I gave her the address.
[02:08:56.999 --> 02:08:58.980]  We're right in the middle of the road at 5 o'clock in the morning.
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:02.542]  Until a policeman comes here and leads us to our parking spot.
[02:09:03.422 --> 02:09:04.923]  Well, they sent this real young cop.
[02:09:04.983 --> 02:09:07.144]  I mean, he was the sweetest little thing you ever saw in your life.
[02:09:07.765 --> 02:09:08.926]  And he was just beside himself.
[02:09:08.946 --> 02:09:10.247]  He said, ma'am, I don't know what to tell you.
[02:09:10.287 --> 02:09:11.828]  I said, well, you tell me where to park.
[02:09:11.928 --> 02:09:12.829]  Here's my permit.
[02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:15.091]  Here's my permit!
[02:09:15.191 --> 02:09:16.352]  My permit!
[02:09:16.472 --> 02:09:17.313]  To speak!
[02:09:17.393 --> 02:09:18.373]  I'm so free!
[02:09:18.413 --> 02:09:18.714]  Yeah.
[02:09:19.374 --> 02:09:20.335]  And so he saw it.
[02:09:20.375 --> 02:09:22.236]  He said, well, follow me.
[02:09:22.276 --> 02:09:23.397]  So he turned the blue lights on.
[02:09:23.437 --> 02:09:25.539]  He led us right down in front of the Justice Building.
[02:09:26.019 --> 02:09:27.120]  And he said, park right here.
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:28.641]  I said, are you sure?
[02:09:28.721 --> 02:09:29.802]  He said, I'm positive.
[02:09:30.583 --> 02:09:32.244]  I said, all right, here's my permit.
[02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:37.008]  Would you sign your name and put your badge number on the back so we know who to call in case we have a problem?
[02:09:37.717 --> 02:09:38.197]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:09:38.237 --> 02:09:39.498]  He was as sweet as he could be.
[02:09:40.058 --> 02:09:42.860]  Well, we got parked, we started setting up, and he left.
[02:09:42.980 --> 02:09:55.807]  All of a sudden, here comes two cop cars, another cop car behind us, and one in front of us, two alongside of us, and I thought, oh, good lord, you know, we're gonna, there's just the two of us there at that time, me and my partner.
[02:09:56.708 --> 02:09:59.590]  And, uh, so we kept on working.
[02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:05.193]  They didn't say anything, but then a guy pulled up his SUV thing, and out comes this dog.
[02:10:05.643 --> 02:10:09.666]  Well, by that time there were other people starting to come in, you know, from the protest.
[02:10:09.686 --> 02:10:10.626]  They were coming to help us.
[02:10:11.747 --> 02:10:14.349]  And there were probably 15 or 20 people there by then.
[02:10:14.369 --> 02:10:20.653]  And this dog gets out, you know, and the guy in this combat uniform thing, he walks around.
[02:10:21.494 --> 02:10:23.075]  And that kind of makes you nervous anyway.
[02:10:23.895 --> 02:10:26.097]  And I asked him, I said, what are you here for?
[02:10:26.577 --> 02:10:27.898]  He said, we're here to protect you.
[02:10:28.378 --> 02:10:28.959]  I said, really?
[02:10:29.539 --> 02:10:30.320]  That's wonderful.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:31.220]  I appreciate that.
[02:10:32.201 --> 02:10:35.243]  And you can see by his eyes, he thought, this old lady is nuts, you know.
[02:10:36.049 --> 02:10:37.430]  And I said, what are you going to do with the dog?
[02:10:38.170 --> 02:10:40.711]  He said, well, we have to sniff out to see if there's any drugs or anything.
[02:10:40.751 --> 02:10:42.032]  We don't want you getting in any trouble.
[02:10:42.292 --> 02:10:42.712]  Oh yeah.
[02:10:42.952 --> 02:10:43.453]  Oh yeah.
[02:10:43.813 --> 02:10:45.574]  Of course they want you to get in trouble.
[02:10:45.594 --> 02:10:47.114]  But he talks to you.
[02:10:47.134 --> 02:10:47.995]  But I mean, think about this.
[02:10:48.055 --> 02:10:49.876]  You're weird because you want freedom.
[02:10:50.216 --> 02:10:53.377]  You're weird because you're involved like Americans used to be.
[02:10:53.798 --> 02:10:54.078]  Right.
[02:10:54.658 --> 02:10:57.399]  Well, he asked us, he said, just what do the granny warriors do?
[02:10:57.419 --> 02:11:00.020]  I said, just what you see us doing right now.
[02:11:00.061 --> 02:11:00.921]  We don't smoke dope.
[02:11:02.523 --> 02:11:04.144]  And he said, oh no, no, I knew that.
[02:11:04.184 --> 02:11:08.325]  You know, he was trying to be real nice and try to placate us, but he wanted to get in this motorhome.
[02:11:09.566 --> 02:11:11.947]  And, uh, he said, you mind if the dog takes a walk inside?
[02:11:12.007 --> 02:11:13.107]  I said, yeah, I do.
[02:11:14.227 --> 02:11:14.848]  He said, why?
[02:11:14.948 --> 02:11:16.148]  I said, because it's my home.
[02:11:16.228 --> 02:11:16.808]  I live in there.
[02:11:16.888 --> 02:11:18.709]  And besides that, I have a pet monkey who's loose.
[02:11:18.729 --> 02:11:22.591]  Now, if your dog thinks he can beat a 12 pound pet monkey, have at it.
[02:11:24.271 --> 02:11:27.292]  And, well, the dog took one look at the monkey and the monkey flared up at him.
[02:11:27.312 --> 02:11:28.153]  And that was the end of that.
[02:11:28.173 --> 02:11:31.294]  What kind of monkey you got?
[02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:33.751]  Uh, Black Cat Capuchin.
[02:11:34.372 --> 02:11:34.632]  Wow.
[02:11:35.352 --> 02:11:37.494]  But, uh, he took the dog.
[02:11:37.554 --> 02:11:42.017]  That dog sniffed every tire, every wheel well, every... Yeah, this is in America.
[02:11:42.057 --> 02:11:42.578]  Listen, listen.
[02:11:42.918 --> 02:11:59.570]  Law Enforcement Magazine, what was it, five years ago, said, and it was more than five, it was right before 9-11, said, and I made a big deal about it on air, that if you've got an anti-UN sticker, get us out of the UN, go ahead and arrest them,
[02:12:00.894 --> 02:12:10.879]  And this happened coast to coast, cops did it, and it tells the police chiefs, now you go ahead and support them, because people that have these stickers are probably terrorists, and just go ahead and bring them on in for questioning.
[02:12:11.379 --> 02:12:15.761]  I mean, you fruitcakes, 70 plus percent of Americans want out of the UN.
[02:12:16.121 --> 02:12:17.722]  Again, how warped are you?
[02:12:17.882 --> 02:12:19.363]  What country do you think this is?
[02:12:19.823 --> 02:12:25.166]  I don't know, we were in Crawford, and we have, on the side of the RV, get us out of the UN.
[02:12:25.826 --> 02:12:26.406]  Big letters.
[02:12:27.647 --> 02:12:29.328]  And the Secret Service guy there was
[02:12:29.994 --> 02:12:30.715]  We're good to go.
[02:12:41.741 --> 02:12:45.484]  He said, well, you know, that kind of stirs up a lot of emotions in some people.
[02:12:45.544 --> 02:12:46.304]  I said, yeah, it really does.
[02:12:46.384 --> 02:12:49.366]  Listen, that's what they're doing in England, what they're doing in America.
[02:12:49.426 --> 02:12:52.048]  Gainridge, they're saying, you can't stir people up.
[02:12:52.088 --> 02:12:52.508]  You can't.
[02:12:52.989 --> 02:12:54.990]  You see, first it was, don't say the N-word.
[02:12:55.070 --> 02:12:58.392]  Now it's, oh, don't say anything bad about the UN.
[02:12:58.432 --> 02:13:00.134]  That could stir somebody up.
[02:13:00.234 --> 02:13:03.436]  I better take you into protective custody.
[02:13:03.496 --> 02:13:04.136]  Hmm.
[02:13:04.897 --> 02:13:09.740]  Well, we also have a sign on the very front, a great big Christmas ball that says, Merry Christmas.
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:11.001]  And I got a sign on there that says,
[02:13:11.539 --> 02:13:12.980]  If this offends you, just tough.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.721]  And the guy wanted us to take that off.
[02:13:15.741 --> 02:13:18.102]  Are you out of your mind?
[02:13:18.142 --> 02:13:20.003]  You can't make me repaint my RV.
[02:13:20.203 --> 02:13:23.544]  So who is this that told you you can't say if you don't like Christmas tough?
[02:13:23.564 --> 02:13:25.045]  It was one of the local cops there.
[02:13:25.105 --> 02:13:27.926]  He said, that just incites people.
[02:13:27.986 --> 02:13:29.807]  He said, that's insulting to some religions.
[02:13:29.887 --> 02:13:30.747]  I said, not to mine.
[02:13:31.128 --> 02:13:33.949]  See, these cops are, and I've got FEMA on tape teaching them.
[02:13:34.409 --> 02:13:37.371]  They're taught anything that hurts anybody's feelings illegal.
[02:13:37.691 --> 02:13:39.132]  You guys are what's illegal.
[02:13:39.352 --> 02:13:44.475]  You're the ones, you're criminals, you're traitors when you try to annihilate our Bill of Rights.
[02:13:44.555 --> 02:13:46.216]  What is your major malfunction?
[02:13:46.696 --> 02:13:49.097]  Well listen, I've got a guest who's been holding for five minutes.
[02:13:49.117 --> 02:13:52.419]  I really appreciate you calling in, Grandma Warrior.
[02:13:52.759 --> 02:13:56.141]  Call in with the rest of your police state stories some other time.
[02:13:57.722 --> 02:13:58.483]  Good to hear from you.
[02:14:01.212 --> 02:14:05.914]  Oh yeah, I mean, I've been at demonstrations and the police are saying, that sign kinda is insightful.
[02:14:07.635 --> 02:14:09.676]  I mean, they're teaching them how to kill America.
[02:14:10.516 --> 02:14:13.318]  Don't you understand that that's the heart and soul of this country?
[02:14:14.418 --> 02:14:16.839]  Alright, I want to welcome to the airwaves J.R.
[02:14:16.879 --> 02:14:17.439]  Williamson.
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:19.800]  Appreciate him holding while I finish up with that collar.
[02:14:20.481 --> 02:14:25.323]  He is a litigator, theologian, and associate of income tax guru Eddie Cain.
[02:14:26.977 --> 02:14:34.159]  Spelled Khan, who is currently assisting actor Wesley Snipes with his IRS persecution.
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:43.862]  And we're here to discuss the federal income tax system, its illegality, and what Cain is doing to help defend Americans against the corrupt Internal Revenue Service.
[02:14:44.322 --> 02:14:45.983]  And of course, J.R.
[02:14:46.023 --> 02:14:52.565]  Williamson is a 71-year-old, now retired, living in Florida, graduated from the University of Texas, spent 26 years in the field of communications.
[02:14:53.343 --> 02:14:56.986]  And again, a close friend with Eddie Cain for over 20 years.
[02:14:57.546 --> 02:15:02.610]  Worked with Eddie at the American Rights Litigators and Guiding Light of God Ministries for three years.
[02:15:03.110 --> 02:15:04.551]  Thank you for coming on, J.R.
[02:15:04.591 --> 02:15:05.072]  Williamson.
[02:15:05.612 --> 02:15:07.673]  Well, thank you for having me.
[02:15:07.814 --> 02:15:21.984]  I appreciate this opportunity to let people know a little something about Eddie Cain and his plight and how he was illegally kidnapped from Panama, where he was living in peace as a pensionado, which was
[02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:46.208]  A status approved by the government, his entry into the country was all very legal and proper, and they were in full knowledge of his civil case against the IRS, and it was ongoing up until the time that he was illegally transported out of the country.
[02:15:47.068 --> 02:15:50.309]  Now, we're about to break, but go ahead and tell that story of what happened to him.
[02:15:51.144 --> 02:16:12.934]  Well, he was living in peace in Panama with his wife and he was writing a book actually and he was invited to come down to immigration for some sort of a conference and at that time he was seized by a federal officer.
[02:16:13.514 --> 02:16:13.794]  That's a U.S.
[02:16:13.814 --> 02:16:14.514]  federal officer?
[02:16:14.534 --> 02:16:14.594]  Yes.
[02:16:23.323 --> 02:16:26.305]  He has not seen the light of day since then.
[02:16:26.725 --> 02:16:28.606]  He's been incarcerated ever since.
[02:16:29.246 --> 02:16:50.557]  The government of Panama issued a restraining order and a habeas corpus and it was being delivered to the airport where he was being taken and they were prevented from going down the concourse where the private plane
[02:16:51.889 --> 02:16:58.294]  I was waiting with Mr. Kane to take him to the United States.
[02:16:59.074 --> 02:17:05.279]  So they were actually prevented from serving a habeas corpus from the High Court of Panama.
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:09.902]  Now, can you describe what you described to my producer?
[02:17:09.942 --> 02:17:11.083]  Well, we'll do this after the break.
[02:17:12.123 --> 02:17:13.004]  Okay.
[02:17:13.044 --> 02:17:14.385]  And folks, here is his phone cutting out.
[02:17:14.425 --> 02:17:15.206]  That's call waiting.
[02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:18.088]  Somebody's calling him over and over again, so it's cutting out some of what you're saying.
[02:17:19.229 --> 02:17:19.729]  That's okay.
[02:17:20.616 --> 02:17:27.263]  We'll describe what happened, how he helped Wesley Snipes, what's happening with Wesley Snipes right now, and how these people operate.
[02:17:27.803 --> 02:17:38.514]  It's amazing what they said to the government official when he tried to give them the order blocking this kidnapping, what they said.
[02:17:38.934 --> 02:17:39.595]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:48.024 --> 02:17:51.786]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:17:52.887 --> 02:17:57.710]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:17:57.910 --> 02:18:00.652]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:00.692 --> 02:18:01.832]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:18:03.153 --> 02:18:07.756]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:18:08.677 --> 02:18:15.881]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:18:16.923 --> 02:18:19.986]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:18:20.226 --> 02:18:25.610]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:18:26.591 --> 02:18:27.852]  Call for your copy today.
[02:18:28.112 --> 02:18:30.314]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:31.375 --> 02:18:37.219]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:38.200]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:38.540]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:46.413 --> 02:18:48.815]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.475 --> 02:19:01.786]  Did you know that those seeking to destroy America and merge us into an all-powerful one-world government said that they support every movement to centralize all authority in Washington, D.C., and therefore bypass the state governments?
[02:19:02.687 --> 02:19:05.909]  That way they would have only one battle to win, Washington, D.C.
[02:19:07.182 --> 02:19:13.350]  Have we witnessed the accumulation of power in Washington and bypassing the states over the last 50 years?
[02:19:13.971 --> 02:19:21.680]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:19:43.219 --> 02:19:46.782]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:19:46.842 --> 02:19:47.343]  are located?
[02:19:47.543 --> 02:19:50.946]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:19:51.166 --> 02:19:55.870]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:19:56.150 --> 02:20:01.154]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:20:01.454 --> 02:20:01.795]  I think so.
[02:20:21.058 --> 02:20:22.059]  We're good to go.
[02:20:43.135 --> 02:20:44.756]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[02:20:44.836 --> 02:20:45.616]  What's wrong?
[02:20:45.636 --> 02:20:46.836]  I am so tired.
[02:20:46.896 --> 02:20:49.377]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[02:20:49.517 --> 02:20:50.598]  I have tried everything.
[02:20:50.658 --> 02:20:52.418]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[02:20:52.558 --> 02:20:53.719]  You name it, I've tried it.
[02:20:53.839 --> 02:20:56.139]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[02:20:56.299 --> 02:20:57.860]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:00.161]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[02:21:00.261 --> 02:21:02.482]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[02:21:02.662 --> 02:21:03.162]  The what?

[02:21:16.487 --> 02:21:20.810]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[02:21:48.849 --> 02:22:02.031]  Welcome back, J.R.
[02:22:02.111 --> 02:22:04.531]  Williamson talking about the Eddie Cain story.
[02:22:05.832 --> 02:22:09.832]  Okay, now this happened recently.
[02:22:10.192 --> 02:22:13.333]  Break down kind of the chain of events and then let's get into what happened at that airport.
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:16.701]  Okay, well it happened about 10 days ago.
[02:22:16.721 --> 02:22:37.712]  He was asked to come down to immigration and of course he had an attorney that he had hired and had previous contact with the Internal Revenue Service and the federal officers that were in Panama and he had told them that he would be glad to meet with them with his attorney
[02:22:38.647 --> 02:22:48.735]  And he would be glad to come back if it served some purpose to come back to the United States on his own free will.
[02:22:49.295 --> 02:22:57.021]  But when he mentioned attorney, they said, oh, well, that's okay then, and they hung up on him.
[02:22:57.562 --> 02:23:08.130]  And I guess he had been under constant surveillance for a couple of weeks because when he was getting out of the car at his attorney's office,
[02:23:09.125 --> 02:23:27.474]  An immigration officer told him that he would like to speak with him and at that point he was arrested and he only, matter of fact, didn't get the chance to see his wife but for about 10 minutes before he was taken out of the country.
[02:23:29.106 --> 02:23:38.389]  You describe what, now the government where he was staying, they sent somebody down to the airport to stop this illegal arrest.
[02:23:38.409 --> 02:23:39.690]  Why don't you break down what happened there?
[02:23:40.130 --> 02:23:51.973]  Well the High Court of Panama issued a habeas corpus and a cease and desist order to prevent them from taking him out of the country.
[02:23:53.074 --> 02:23:57.135]  And one of the people from the office of the High Court went to the
[02:23:58.107 --> 02:23:59.168]  We're good to go.
[02:24:21.741 --> 02:24:30.127]  So while she was being actually detained at the airport, the plane took off, of course, with Eddie Cain aboard.
[02:24:31.087 --> 02:24:39.853]  Now, I had heard the story, I want to know if this is accurate, that actually the security guards told the high court official, we'll shoot you if you try to get past us.
[02:24:41.054 --> 02:24:46.257]  Well, I'm not sure whether that was actually true or not, but that was reported.
[02:24:47.498 --> 02:24:51.461]  I mean, you've got to love these third world countries where just private thugs are there blocking the court.
[02:24:52.052 --> 02:24:57.693]  Yeah, we have an affidavit from the attorney that tried to serve the papers.
[02:24:58.093 --> 02:25:00.914]  Now, this is no normal IRS case.
[02:25:01.194 --> 02:25:05.614]  They plan to burn Wesley Snipes publicly to scare people.
[02:25:05.655 --> 02:25:11.095]  They love going after prominent people, like Willie Nelson and others, and it turned out that whole case was a fraud.
[02:25:11.616 --> 02:25:15.256]  Sure, like Red Buttons, I guess it was.
[02:25:15.276 --> 02:25:15.996]  Yeah, Red Fox.
[02:25:16.376 --> 02:25:17.177]  Red Fox, right.
[02:25:17.217 --> 02:25:19.057]  Yeah, they do this over and over again.
[02:25:20.078 --> 02:25:26.142]  And so they want to arrest Wesley, they don't want to, and so now they've gone after his tax expert.
[02:25:26.182 --> 02:25:31.285]  Tell us what Mr. Kane had done for Wesley Snipes.
[02:25:31.605 --> 02:25:46.235]  Well, actually the relationship with Wesley, he was just a member among 5,600 members of American Rights Litigators, which you pay an annual fee, and then when there is an issue that
[02:25:47.473 --> 02:25:48.413]  I don't know.
[02:26:07.752 --> 02:26:08.694]  I don't think so.
[02:26:25.035 --> 02:26:30.137]  Well, they sent agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which of course have no jurisdiction outside of federal property.
[02:26:30.157 --> 02:26:31.197]  You know, that's a fact.
[02:26:31.217 --> 02:26:35.039]  They were in Panama and took Eddie Cain illegally and unlawfully, and that's a fact.
[02:26:57.307 --> 02:27:15.807]  When he was seized, he was given no opportunity to have access to his own attorney, which he had previously told them that he would be glad to meet with them in the presence of his attorney and discuss the matter and even agreed to come back to the United States if it was necessary and lawful that he do so.
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:19.040]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:20.281]  I want to continue with this story.
[02:27:20.301 --> 02:27:22.821]  Then we'll cover some final news and take some more calls.
[02:27:22.882 --> 02:27:27.843]  On the other side, we'll give out some websites and information as well with our guests if you want to learn more.
[02:27:28.563 --> 02:27:32.945]  But this is the lawlessness of this out-of-control government.
[02:27:36.246 --> 02:27:37.146]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.646 --> 02:27:39.247]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.167 --> 02:27:42.868]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.024 --> 02:27:52.147]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:52.388 --> 02:27:54.149]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:54.409 --> 02:28:00.694]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:28:00.994 --> 02:28:07.099]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:07.359 --> 02:28:09.201]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:28:09.241 --> 02:28:15.284]  It uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[02:28:15.324 --> 02:28:20.066]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.

[02:28:45.899 --> 02:28:51.124]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:28:51.264 --> 02:28:59.373]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:59.613 --> 02:29:06.680]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:08.121]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:29:08.221 --> 02:29:14.103]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:29:14.304 --> 02:29:19.386]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:29:19.486 --> 02:29:28.370]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:29:28.650 --> 02:29:32.772]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:52.505]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:29:52.925 --> 02:29:57.668]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:29:58.069 --> 02:30:00.690]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:30:01.191 --> 02:30:04.553]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:30:05.350 --> 02:30:09.674]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:30:10.134 --> 02:30:13.297]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:30:13.917 --> 02:30:16.740]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:30:17.518 --> 02:30:19.659]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:21.580]  U.S.
[02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:23.901]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[02:30:23.921 --> 02:30:24.201]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[02:30:24.221 --> 02:30:25.101]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[02:30:25.121 --> 02:30:25.882]  Ask for George.
[02:30:55.280 --> 02:31:06.288]  Your own personal Jesus.
[02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:11.831]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:31:12.392 --> 02:31:13.873]  Someone who cares.
[02:31:14.493 --> 02:31:17.115]  Your own personal Jesus.
[02:31:25.098 --> 02:31:27.499]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:31:27.979 --> 02:31:36.363]  Someone who's there.
[02:31:40.625 --> 02:31:43.746]  Feeling unknown and you're all alone.
[02:31:44.467 --> 02:31:48.048]  Flashing home by the telephone.
[02:31:48.408 --> 02:31:52.430]  Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer.
[02:31:52.890 --> 02:31:54.291]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:55.407 --> 02:31:57.127]  We have a lot of bizarre call names here.
[02:31:57.167 --> 02:31:59.328]  We've got somebody calling themselves Mollick from Bohemian Grub.
[02:31:59.348 --> 02:32:05.889]  I'm going to get to them, but I'll go and order George, Patrick, Kadav, Mollick.
[02:32:05.909 --> 02:32:06.489]  We'll get to that.
[02:32:06.509 --> 02:32:07.709]  That's a real nice name there.
[02:32:08.189 --> 02:32:09.850]  We'll see what happens with that call.
[02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:22.692]  But going back to our guest, who I really appreciate coming on with us, he's talking about what's happening to Wesley Snipes, what's happening to one of the other members, one of the prominent members of the group, Eddie Kane.
[02:32:23.676 --> 02:32:31.400]  This just illustrates, and I did read this even in the mainstream papers, they admitted they just grabbed him without the extradition order, without anything.
[02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:32.620]  It's just lawlessness.
[02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:42.805]  Across the board, the entire system is going lawless, and it all goes back to that root of the private Federal Reserve and its enforcement arm, the IRS.
[02:32:43.965 --> 02:32:46.026]  Do we know where they're holding Eddie Kane?
[02:32:47.107 --> 02:32:49.928]  Yes, he is in the Marion County Jail.
[02:32:50.669 --> 02:32:52.510]  He is inmate number 0101-545.
[02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:55.432]  And that's Marion?
[02:32:56.393 --> 02:32:58.114]  Marion County Jail.
[02:32:58.394 --> 02:33:00.195]  It's in Ocala, Florida.
[02:33:00.215 --> 02:33:00.195]  34475.
[02:33:00.815 --> 02:33:03.257]  You can write him there and you can also go to FreeEddieCain.com
[02:33:09.688 --> 02:33:16.291]  And we're constructing a website to give information and to get donations to assist in his legal fire.
[02:33:16.331 --> 02:33:16.411]  Sure.
[02:33:16.611 --> 02:33:17.912]  What are they claiming he's done?
[02:33:17.952 --> 02:33:19.233]  Why have they kidnapped him?
[02:33:19.673 --> 02:33:24.615]  Well, they've actually charged him under Title 18 and also under Title 26.
[02:33:26.176 --> 02:33:27.957]  But it's a conspiracy charge.
[02:33:29.038 --> 02:33:33.580]  And basically that's a conspiracy to defeat the Internal Revenue System.
[02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:35.801]  And that's basically it.
[02:33:38.473 --> 02:33:40.115]  And they've done this to so many people.
[02:33:41.176 --> 02:33:48.983]  Joe Bannister was an armed treasury agent, excellent career, six years there, and he heard a talk show.
[02:33:49.003 --> 02:33:54.168]  I was the first person to interview him on talk radio and for TV back in the late 90s.
[02:33:54.569 --> 02:33:56.190]  He heard a radio show with D.V.
[02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:58.653]  Kidd on a mainstream show in California in the Bay Area.
[02:33:59.253 --> 02:34:00.455]  He was a liar.
[02:34:00.575 --> 02:34:01.556]  He was going to disprove her.
[02:34:01.876 --> 02:34:04.318]  He spent two years and found out it was all a big scam.
[02:34:04.799 --> 02:34:06.000]  They told him to shut up.
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:08.523]  And he kept paying his taxes, by the way, folks.
[02:34:08.543 --> 02:34:10.164]  He was putting it in an account and paying them.
[02:34:10.745 --> 02:34:17.652]  And just because he went public, they indicted him on a bunch of stuff and the jury acquitted him and boy, they just blew up.
[02:34:18.784 --> 02:34:21.445]  And they've got a bunch of IRS agents going public now.
[02:34:21.465 --> 02:34:23.647]  They've found out it all goes into these private banks.
[02:34:24.127 --> 02:34:24.907]  And it really does.
[02:34:24.927 --> 02:34:28.989]  And see, now, again, I connect this into the North American Union.
[02:34:29.370 --> 02:34:32.851]  I connect this into the District of Columbia, sign the contracts to merge us.
[02:34:33.211 --> 02:34:34.432]  Congress has no authority.
[02:34:34.712 --> 02:34:37.414]  I mean, this group is openly hijacked this country now.
[02:34:38.014 --> 02:34:46.058]  Well, Alex, if you look at the 1040 form itself, it has a bogus OMB number on it.
[02:34:46.650 --> 02:34:52.194]  A proper OMB number must show its date of issue and its date of expiration.
[02:34:52.954 --> 02:35:01.920]  And of course, under the Privacy Act, you cannot be compelled to fill out a form that is not a proper OMB number.
[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:07.844]  Now that's the 86 law, but on top of it, you can't be compelled to incriminate yourself under the Fifth Amendment.
[02:35:07.864 --> 02:35:08.905]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:35:08.985 --> 02:35:12.007]  And the former IRS Commissioner just says, well, we're outside the courts.
[02:35:12.646 --> 02:35:12.846]  Right.
[02:35:13.026 --> 02:35:21.349]  Yeah, just like the child courts, the family courts, all these new courts just say they're outside the courts and they just do whatever they want.
[02:35:21.389 --> 02:35:24.650]  But on top of all of that, the OMB should direct you to the U.S.
[02:35:24.690 --> 02:35:27.511]  Code, but it can't direct you there because there's no law.
[02:35:28.251 --> 02:35:28.711]  Exactly.
[02:35:28.771 --> 02:35:35.613]  And federal-aid education has debilitated about five generations of people because they control what is taught.
[02:35:36.333 --> 02:35:41.995]  So they get, at graduation from high school, you have a perfect little automaton and
[02:35:42.839 --> 02:35:55.464]  Meat for the fodder for the Burger King and McDonald's, etc., etc., which never questioned the fact that about 40% of their total production is being taken away from them.
[02:35:55.684 --> 02:35:58.165]  Now see, they told Americans driving was a privilege.
[02:35:58.225 --> 02:35:59.646]  I have the federal rulings, it's not.
[02:36:00.906 --> 02:36:07.689]  Now they're telling people they can shield carries coast-to-coast that guns are a privilege, Second Amendment's a privilege, which they can then revoke.
[02:36:07.729 --> 02:36:08.489]  It isn't a privilege.
[02:36:10.050 --> 02:36:13.533]  Now they're telling us demonstrating is a privilege, then they revoke that privilege.
[02:36:13.854 --> 02:36:23.862]  They're claiming everything is a privilege now, and it's not, but then by custom they try to somehow install it into common law, which you can't do.
[02:36:23.883 --> 02:36:30.889]  I've read the federal cases where they're grabbing some woman's 98 acres in Colorado because they want to build a hotel on it.
[02:36:31.389 --> 02:36:31.809]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:36:31.869 --> 02:36:37.933]  And if they ever admit in court that it's admiralty, you can say, well, bring forth a contract where I've knowingly and willingly put my name to.
[02:36:51.477 --> 02:36:58.680]  And again, that goes to the base admiralty law you sign into when you sign the papers to be inducted into the military.
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:04.163]  But they're telling us all, under the War Powers Act, that we have been inducted as indentured servants.
[02:37:04.343 --> 02:37:05.523]  And look at what Rangel's saying.
[02:37:05.824 --> 02:37:08.925]  National service for everybody, serving domestically.
[02:37:11.046 --> 02:37:16.288]  So for those that go, well the IRS, they've got the guns, they're the boss, it must be a law.
[02:37:16.729 --> 02:37:18.289]  It's the same with all of this.
[02:37:18.329 --> 02:37:19.570]  They just do whatever they want.
[02:37:20.342 --> 02:37:21.803]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:37:22.363 --> 02:37:23.303]  So where does it go from here?
[02:37:23.323 --> 02:37:24.904]  What do you think is going to happen with Wesley Snipes?
[02:37:25.624 --> 02:37:31.626]  Well, I'm sure that there will be some interesting developments come out of this case.
[02:37:32.547 --> 02:37:42.871]  Wesley, I know, is a righteous individual who never... It wasn't about the several million dollars, because he's got plenty of money to last him for the rest of his life.
[02:37:42.931 --> 02:37:44.692]  It was about the principle, as a matter of fact.
[02:37:45.092 --> 02:37:46.372]  He didn't want to be a slave.
[02:37:47.012 --> 02:37:48.153]  And he says, well, you know,
[02:37:48.891 --> 02:37:50.512]  This is slavery.
[02:37:50.552 --> 02:37:57.815]  If I don't own the fruit of my labors, then that was slavery.
[02:37:57.855 --> 02:38:08.039]  And of course he doesn't object to paying legitimately placed taxes, which are apportioned equally among the states, which is the only legal taxes that the federal government can apply.
[02:38:10.623 --> 02:38:12.724]  To the American people, they can levy tariffs.
[02:38:13.164 --> 02:38:17.086]  Oh yes, they can levy tariffs, impose, excise, and duties.
[02:38:17.506 --> 02:38:23.970]  But where a direct tax is levied upon the people of the United States of America, it must be apportioned equally among the states.
[02:38:24.130 --> 02:38:25.550]  But that's just the Constitution.
[02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:31.513]  Why don't we just listen to some federal judge who said over and over again, I don't allow the law in my courtroom.
[02:38:31.974 --> 02:38:38.657]  Well, the federal judge is sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution as his consideration of a public office.
[02:38:39.187 --> 02:38:48.711]  And if you ever ask him that, then you've pretty much put the plate ready for him to be served if he denies it.
[02:38:49.207 --> 02:38:49.527]  J.R.
[02:38:49.567 --> 02:38:50.868]  Williamson, you're a learned man.
[02:38:50.908 --> 02:38:53.190]  You've been around a while.
[02:38:53.250 --> 02:39:03.839]  To see America degenerate like this, I guess the only good news is now the corruption is accelerating into a wanton orgy so fast that it's got to come to an end soon.
[02:39:03.899 --> 02:39:06.281]  I mean, are you not seeing the same thing I'm seeing?
[02:39:06.641 --> 02:39:07.402]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:07.582 --> 02:39:09.744]  I think more and more people are becoming aware.
[02:39:09.884 --> 02:39:16.109]  More and more people are searching the internet for the truth and are finding out the truth and are rebelling.
[02:39:16.664 --> 02:39:20.207]  I think there's 85 million people who file no income tax return.
[02:39:20.287 --> 02:39:21.368]  Yeah, the government admits that.
[02:39:21.828 --> 02:39:22.088]  Right.
[02:39:22.329 --> 02:39:25.411]  And the fact is, they still got the money.
[02:39:27.192 --> 02:39:37.000]  You know, if they're working for somebody else, the employer is so afraid of having trouble with the IRS, he's going to withhold and he's going to pay the withholding to the government.
[02:39:37.160 --> 02:39:43.966]  Well, I saw a letter Wesley wrote when we were trying to get him on the show through Aaron Russo, but he's still in Africa, but we've been talking to him through Russo.
[02:39:44.887 --> 02:39:50.929]  And basically he got in a shenanigan, got sued, somebody tried to take a house from him with a paternity suit.
[02:39:51.029 --> 02:39:54.451]  He beat it, and then they went and ratted him to the IRS.
[02:39:54.851 --> 02:39:56.391]  Then he discovered all of this.
[02:39:56.712 --> 02:40:01.834]  So yeah, the guy makes like five, six million dollars a movie, and he's made, what is it, eighty something movies.
[02:40:01.854 --> 02:40:03.094]  So the guy doesn't need money.
[02:40:03.334 --> 02:40:05.015]  This is over a few million dollars.
[02:40:05.455 --> 02:40:06.815]  He's saying, hey, I don't know this.
[02:40:07.376 --> 02:40:08.236]  Right, exactly.
[02:40:09.805 --> 02:40:12.906]  And he is a man of principle and he's sticking to his guns.
[02:40:13.486 --> 02:40:14.787]  It'll be an interesting case.
[02:40:15.667 --> 02:40:17.868]  It'll be interesting to see what develops from here.
[02:40:17.948 --> 02:40:21.048]  Now they've been already trying to extradite him from the African country he's in.
[02:40:22.149 --> 02:40:26.630]  Right, but there is no extradition and of course he won't be coming back until he finishes his movie.
[02:40:27.010 --> 02:40:30.011]  He's under contract and he honors all of his contracts.
[02:40:33.058 --> 02:40:39.203]  Where's it going to go with the IRS as the people wake up to the fact that it's a collection arm for the private Federal Reserve?
[02:40:39.683 --> 02:40:50.571]  Well, hopefully one of these days the Federal Reserve will be disbanded and we'll start with United States notes, which do not create debt for all of us with each issuance.
[02:40:51.451 --> 02:40:56.395]  And that will come to pass, but I don't know when that will be, Alex, I really don't.
[02:40:57.396 --> 02:41:00.398]  You heard the story earlier, and I've had police say this to me, where they think
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:06.783]  Well, I think most of the police are put into effect and it's no longer serve the people, it's to serve this big business and the corporate America.
[02:41:30.689 --> 02:41:33.450]  I believe it's in March is when his trial date is.
[02:41:36.711 --> 02:41:40.353]  And I guess they're going to hold that down there in Florida where they've got all their kangaroo courts?
[02:41:41.393 --> 02:41:45.835]  It's going to be in Ocala, which is where it is, the U.S.
[02:41:45.875 --> 02:41:47.195]  District Court in Ocala.
[02:41:50.177 --> 02:41:50.797]  Amazing!
[02:41:50.857 --> 02:41:52.277]  Why do you think they went after Eddie?
[02:41:55.218 --> 02:41:58.280]  Because he was in the, you know, there's like say a big following.
[02:41:59.625 --> 02:42:10.996]  The publicity around Wesley Snipes, just like they used with Red Fox and others that have been held up to the public, you know, just put the other people in to scare the bejesus out of them.
[02:42:13.718 --> 02:42:14.519]  I forget his name.
[02:42:14.559 --> 02:42:16.061]  It's in America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:42:16.101 --> 02:42:17.602]  I'm having a mental slip here.
[02:42:17.882 --> 02:42:18.763]  The Brown Bomber.
[02:42:18.803 --> 02:42:19.884]  Who was that famous boxer?
[02:42:20.645 --> 02:42:21.506]  Oh, Joe Lewis.
[02:42:22.023 --> 02:42:36.108]  Yeah, Joe Louis, he gave his huge champion prize fight money, fighting that German, I think it was like $100,000, I forget the exact number, he gave it to the troops and so the IRS claimed it was a gift and ruined him for the rest of his life.
[02:42:36.609 --> 02:42:37.809]  Yeah.
[02:42:37.829 --> 02:42:39.790]  I mean, they're just scum.
[02:42:40.330 --> 02:42:42.911]  Yeah, absolutely, and they did the same thing to several
[02:42:45.004 --> 02:42:50.269]  Why does it seem like they really like to go after wealthy black people?
[02:42:50.770 --> 02:42:52.251]  Oh right, in high profile.
[02:42:52.371 --> 02:42:56.535]  So they get everybody scared to death that it's going to be them that's next.
[02:42:56.636 --> 02:43:00.980]  But is that also playing to an undercurrent of racism that, oh yeah, get that rich black guy?
[02:43:01.601 --> 02:43:03.543]  I think there is, definitely so.
[02:43:05.565 --> 02:43:06.726]  It's to hurt in the truth.
[02:43:09.315 --> 02:43:09.835]  I'll tell you.
[02:43:10.576 --> 02:43:12.096]  Any contact info for you, sir?
[02:43:12.117 --> 02:43:13.557]  Any other websites you'd like to get out?
[02:43:14.718 --> 02:43:16.459]  Actually, let's see.
[02:43:17.179 --> 02:43:21.921]  You can go to FreeEddieCain.com, which is being put together.
[02:43:21.941 --> 02:43:27.024]  I guess that's the big one.
[02:43:27.864 --> 02:43:34.368]  Like I said, if you want to write to Eddie, his name is Eddie Cain and his inmate number is 0101-545.
[02:43:37.715 --> 02:43:43.520]  Care of the Marion County Jail, 700 Northwest 30th Avenue in Ocala, Florida, 34475.
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:59.014]  Oh, and if you can make donations to This Day Christian Ministries, care of 6558 Racquet Club Drive in Lauder Hill, Florida, 33319.
[02:44:01.369 --> 02:44:01.829]  All right.
[02:44:02.270 --> 02:44:04.811]  Well, sir, check in with us as it develops, and God bless you.
[02:44:05.392 --> 02:44:06.212]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:44:06.252 --> 02:44:06.993]  Thank you very much.
[02:44:07.233 --> 02:44:08.694]  Appreciate your time today.
[02:44:09.274 --> 02:44:12.076]  We have links to those websites up on InfoWars.com.
[02:44:12.836 --> 02:44:14.197]  Let's go to... I'm going to move quick now.
[02:44:14.217 --> 02:44:15.118]  I've got to get through these calls.
[02:44:15.218 --> 02:44:16.078]  George in Indiana.
[02:44:16.098 --> 02:44:16.459]  Go ahead.
[02:44:17.619 --> 02:44:17.940]  Whoa!
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:19.320]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:19.721]  Go ahead.
[02:44:19.961 --> 02:44:20.461]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:44:20.481 --> 02:44:21.722]  A couple of things I wanted to mention.
[02:44:22.002 --> 02:44:24.984]  One on 9-11 and the other one on... You were talking about marijuana.
[02:44:25.024 --> 02:44:25.885]  I live in Indiana.
[02:44:26.225 --> 02:44:29.527]  You go to northern Indiana, back during World War II, they grew hemp.
[02:44:30.236 --> 02:44:33.328]  Well, they've tried to destroy these fields and they're huge, man.
[02:44:33.368 --> 02:44:34.753]  They come back up every year.
[02:44:35.447 --> 02:44:38.469]  The cops will, and you could smoke that whole field and not get a buzz.
[02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:42.892]  In fact, there are, I forget how many varieties, but I know it's over 40 or 50.
[02:44:43.512 --> 02:44:44.693]  I saw a documentary on it.
[02:44:45.213 --> 02:45:04.166]  Almost all hemp, there's only one species, and then it's only one sex of the plant that has THC, but yes, they all over the country, I've seen that eradicate marijuana fields, hemp that has no THC in it, and is wonderful, better than cotton, better for rope, but I'm sorry, I'll shut up, go ahead.
[02:45:04.446 --> 02:45:07.348]  No, well, the Declaration of Independence was printed on hemp.
[02:45:08.089 --> 02:45:13.974]  All of our books in our libraries on this plain paper, the acid and stuff, eats them up over time.
[02:45:14.014 --> 02:45:16.636]  But hemp's beautiful, you know, for paper and for clothing.
[02:45:16.656 --> 02:45:16.996]  You're right.
[02:45:17.456 --> 02:45:29.886]  The second thing I wanted to ask is, I've heard you guys mention doing reverse engineering, but I've never heard anybody use that term when they go to the molten iron at the basement of those buildings.
[02:45:30.279 --> 02:45:34.303]  If you were to reverse engineer that, doesn't that lead you right to what caused it?
[02:45:36.546 --> 02:45:38.868]  Well, we know that jet fuel burns at 1,800.
[02:45:40.129 --> 02:45:42.912]  Non-structural doesn't melt till 2,754 degrees.
[02:45:47.097 --> 02:45:48.317]  Structural as high as 3300.
[02:45:48.938 --> 02:45:53.539]  And we have the firefighters and we have the video saying it was just molten pools of steel.
[02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:58.301]  Only, I don't even see, a lot of scientists say thermite couldn't even do that.
[02:45:58.801 --> 02:46:01.402]  I mean, this stuff was turned into molten slag.
[02:46:02.383 --> 02:46:06.404]  Yeah, I see the ball was as big as a half of a dump truck they had on one of your videos.
[02:46:07.104 --> 02:46:07.745]  It's amazing.
[02:46:08.405 --> 02:46:09.345]  Well, that's all I had.
[02:46:09.725 --> 02:46:10.385]  I listened to you.
[02:46:10.966 --> 02:46:11.606]  God bless you.
[02:46:11.646 --> 02:46:14.507]  And I hope we can turn this around before too many people get hurt.
[02:46:15.166 --> 02:46:16.266]  I appreciate you, my friend.
[02:46:16.306 --> 02:46:17.186]  God bless you, too.
[02:46:17.627 --> 02:46:20.987]  And that's, again, if we don't all hang together, we'll hang separate.
[02:46:21.547 --> 02:46:24.728]  And I want to thank the affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners, everybody.
[02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:25.588]  It's such an honor.
[02:46:26.148 --> 02:46:27.009]  I think about it every day.
[02:46:27.069 --> 02:46:29.489]  I'm humbled to be your host, and thanks for putting up with me.
[02:46:30.609 --> 02:46:32.930]  Let's talk to Patrick in Texas.
[02:46:32.970 --> 02:46:33.750]  Patrick, go ahead.
[02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:39.131]  Alex, I'm so-called mentally ill, and I won't take your pills, so they forcefully inject me.
[02:46:39.871 --> 02:46:42.732]  One day, I didn't want to take my injections, so they came and got me.
[02:46:43.305 --> 02:46:46.127]  Well, I had a little two-inch pocket knife in one of my pockets.
[02:46:46.887 --> 02:46:53.572]  And since I had my belt tied, because I didn't want them to give me an injection, they cut my belt, yanked my pants down, and injected me.
[02:46:54.032 --> 02:46:57.074]  And when I got home, I found my knife in my little carry-on bag.
[02:46:58.515 --> 02:47:01.457]  And I seen one woman, she was supposedly a bipolar.
[02:47:01.537 --> 02:47:04.899]  Well, they came and got her TV set after they intuitionalized her.
[02:47:04.979 --> 02:47:06.040]  I seen them one night.
[02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.983]  Well, sir, how about you just gum the pills?
[02:47:10.423 --> 02:47:11.424]  No, I don't take the pills.
[02:47:11.464 --> 02:47:12.245]  They force me to take them.
[02:47:12.285 --> 02:47:30.481]  No, I know, but just look, it's better in a system like that to fool them and to be deceptive and then to act like you're going to eat them and then just put it in the back of your mouth or if you have to, swallow it and then gag yourself and then the first few times they'll think you're submitting and you won't have to gag anymore.
[02:47:30.881 --> 02:47:31.882]  That's how you defeat that.
[02:47:32.642 --> 02:47:36.483]  Well, they won't put me on pills and I won't take it.
[02:47:36.843 --> 02:47:38.723]  Tell them you like the pills now.
[02:47:38.843 --> 02:47:39.583]  They won't do it.
[02:47:39.603 --> 02:47:40.743]  They know I won't take their crap.
[02:47:40.783 --> 02:47:42.084]  I'm just giving other people a tip.
[02:47:42.124 --> 02:47:42.644]  I gotta jump.
[02:47:42.684 --> 02:47:43.464]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:47:43.484 --> 02:47:44.144]  Good to hear from you.
[02:47:44.424 --> 02:47:45.544]  Haven't heard from you in about a year.
[02:47:46.444 --> 02:47:49.945]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kada in Brooklyn.
[02:47:49.985 --> 02:47:50.945]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:50.965 --> 02:48:00.167]  I just want to make a comment, a question, sort of, concerning the infringement and the
[02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:02.491]  We're good to go.
[02:48:23.664 --> 02:48:27.666]  For the true laws that we as men have to abide by.
[02:48:27.746 --> 02:48:28.286]  No they don't!
[02:48:28.346 --> 02:48:34.469]  They're criminals, they've bought off the system, and they're telling us that we're all criminals because we don't want to submit to their slavery.
[02:48:34.489 --> 02:48:38.711]  Stay there, I'll let you finish up, then we'll talk to Molek from Bohemian Row.
[02:48:39.451 --> 02:48:40.372]  That ought to be interesting.
[02:48:49.292 --> 02:48:52.434]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.814 --> 02:48:54.755]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:55.115 --> 02:49:02.779]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.439 --> 02:49:10.523]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.903 --> 02:49:17.747]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:22.321]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.621 --> 02:49:26.122]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.602 --> 02:49:28.503]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.843 --> 02:49:32.764]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.078 --> 02:49:47.940]  Dad, can we stop?
[02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:49.781]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:49:50.202 --> 02:49:50.462]  What?
[02:49:50.802 --> 02:49:51.162]  Again?
[02:49:51.583 --> 02:49:53.224]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:49:53.284 --> 02:49:57.708]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:49:57.948 --> 02:49:59.229]  Why did you do that?
[02:49:59.449 --> 02:50:05.254]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:50:05.534 --> 02:50:06.575]  Are we there yet?
[02:50:06.675 --> 02:50:07.736]  for the entire trip.
[02:50:07.996 --> 02:50:10.198]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[02:50:10.679 --> 02:50:11.680]  Great idea.
[02:50:11.700 --> 02:50:14.522]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:50:14.901 --> 02:50:17.367]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:50:17.567 --> 02:50:21.957]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:50:22.258 --> 02:50:22.559]  Honey!
[02:50:23.379 --> 02:50:24.620]  You're terrific!
[02:50:25.001 --> 02:50:26.502]  Oh honey, so are you!
[02:50:26.622 --> 02:50:30.026]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:50:30.306 --> 02:50:31.087]  Now can we stop?
[02:50:31.587 --> 02:50:32.328]  I need to go too.
[02:50:32.628 --> 02:50:37.073]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.133 --> 02:50:39.035]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:45.692 --> 02:50:51.519]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.
[02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:57.066]  You'll find thousands of effective, alternative, and natural products for you and the whole family.

[02:51:04.756 --> 02:51:05.237]  I think so.
[02:51:23.558 --> 02:51:24.218]  I think so.
[02:51:50.630 --> 02:51:54.212]  The level of tyranny you're going to live under is the exact amount you accept.
[02:51:54.452 --> 02:52:01.334]  And they use all this fancy propaganda, high-tech deception, to sell you on how you need the state and these corporations.
[02:52:01.855 --> 02:52:02.715]  I mean, take Target.
[02:52:02.995 --> 02:52:09.738]  They're putting up checkpoint towers all over the country, surveillance, merging with the police, because they know the future.
[02:52:09.778 --> 02:52:10.838]  That's going to be the economy.
[02:52:12.623 --> 02:52:13.804]  It's called slavery, folks.
[02:52:13.864 --> 02:52:14.764]  It's the norm.
[02:52:15.305 --> 02:52:19.667]  Going back to Kaddah there in Brooklyn, then we'll go to Moloch from Bohemian Grove.
[02:52:19.707 --> 02:52:21.028]  That's what the caller says their name is.
[02:52:22.649 --> 02:52:23.150]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:52:24.590 --> 02:52:30.674]  Yeah, so basically, we have to fight against these people in the courts.
[02:52:31.715 --> 02:52:37.238]  Because I'm a die-hard believer in the scriptures and follow the faith of Jesus Christ.
[02:52:38.379 --> 02:52:39.660]  And like it says in Ephesians,
[02:52:40.410 --> 02:52:49.418]  We don't fight a carnal fight of flesh and blood against principalities and powers of high places and against the rulers of the darkness of this world.
[02:52:49.978 --> 02:53:07.013]  And when we have to go to these court systems and we have to be burdened with these lawyers that basically belong to different societies, that they have to go to rules and make deals and try to negotiate with the courts
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:09.202]  I don't think so.
[02:53:23.164 --> 02:53:25.925]  Well, that's really it.
[02:53:25.965 --> 02:53:32.347]  I mean, if people had the spirit of the Lord in them, they would care about righteousness and goodness and good winning.
[02:53:32.807 --> 02:53:38.229]  They just care about going along with the system, to have baubles and trinkets, to have the signets of power.
[02:53:38.829 --> 02:53:47.272]  And if we indicate to them that we explicitly reserve the right not to be involved with a contract that will make us liable or be bound
[02:53:48.160 --> 02:53:54.965]  To be obligated to... Well, sir, there is something to not being part of their system and reserving your rights, and a lot of that's real.
[02:53:55.405 --> 02:53:57.087]  But at the same time, we're starting to win.
[02:53:57.107 --> 02:54:00.449]  I mean, the people are waking up to this nest of criminals right now.
[02:54:00.489 --> 02:54:03.131]  That's why they're moving to restrict our free speech, moving to do all this.
[02:54:03.171 --> 02:54:04.412]  But good to hear from you.
[02:54:04.432 --> 02:54:05.193]  I'm almost out of time.
[02:54:05.213 --> 02:54:06.574]  I wanted to take one final caller.
[02:54:07.214 --> 02:54:09.836]  What would induce you, caller, to call yourself Moloch?
[02:54:09.876 --> 02:54:10.316]  Go ahead.
[02:54:10.757 --> 02:54:11.137]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:11.157 --> 02:54:13.058]  This is Moloch from Bohemian Grove.
[02:54:13.158 --> 02:54:13.579]  How are you?
[02:54:14.890 --> 02:54:15.871]  I'm doing alright, caller.
[02:54:15.891 --> 02:54:16.531]  What's on your mind?
[02:54:16.891 --> 02:54:18.452]  Oh, I just wanted to call.
[02:54:18.472 --> 02:54:20.374]  I saw you back in July of 2000.
[02:54:20.454 --> 02:54:23.216]  You didn't seem to be enjoying the cremation of care ceremony.
[02:54:23.236 --> 02:54:24.837]  Uh, no.
[02:54:24.917 --> 02:54:25.877]  I wasn't enjoying it.
[02:54:26.217 --> 02:54:27.939]  What's wrong with being a Canaanite deity?
[02:54:32.535 --> 02:54:36.718]  Well, I mean, you know, give not your children to the fires of Moloch.
[02:54:37.138 --> 02:54:43.782]  I know that our Christian conservative leaders predominantly go and worship Satan, but I don't think that's very nice, and so we're going to expose it.
[02:54:44.203 --> 02:54:46.945]  Well, the girls at Hooters seem to like me.
[02:54:47.685 --> 02:54:49.306]  They wear my picture on their t-shirt.
[02:54:50.647 --> 02:54:52.828]  That's right, the little hoot owl.
[02:54:53.109 --> 02:54:54.209]  Yes, that's me.
[02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:58.632]  You know what the best thing about being a canonized idea is, Alex?
[02:54:59.033 --> 02:54:59.533]  What is it?
[02:54:59.963 --> 02:55:01.104]  You never get cold feet!
[02:55:04.146 --> 02:55:05.927]  All right, man, I appreciate your call.
[02:55:06.628 --> 02:55:10.511]  Pretty ridiculous, pretty ridiculous note to close out the transmission.
