[00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:06.122]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:07.843]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:09.643]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.303 --> 00:00:11.124]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.884 --> 00:00:12.804]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:17.186]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.626 --> 00:00:21.747]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:31.230]  Deep behind enemy lines, live from Chemtrail County, Texas,
[00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:34.106]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:36.567]  I am Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:39.909]  I'll actually be sitting in for the next couple of days.
[00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.131]  Alex will be back on Thursday, but I'm really glad you could join us today.
[00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:46.732]  It is the 23rd day of January 2006.
[00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:49.534]  Strap on in, folks.
[00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:51.835]  We've got a wild ride for you today.
[00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:56.020]  We will be doing several interviews on the Second Amendment.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.303]  I hope all of you have read the Second Amendment.
[00:00:58.323 --> 00:00:59.344]  You know what that is.
[00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:06.914]  Richard Pearson, Executive Director, Illinois State Rifle Association, will be joining us at the top of the second hour.
[00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.538]  We're going to be talking about these Floyd cards.
[00:01:10.347 --> 00:01:19.441]  Yes, the plot thickens, and Aaron Zellman, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, will be joining us also in the second hour of today's broadcast.
[00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.806]  But we have a ton of news to cover before we get started.
[00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:27.283]  I host Deadline Live on Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:31.867]  It follows the Alex Jones Show five days a week, Monday through Friday.
[00:01:31.887 --> 00:01:32.788]  That would be 2 p.m.
[00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:33.628]  to 4 p.m.
[00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:35.090]  Central Time.
[00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.695]  And I've been doing the program for roughly about five years in various forms and formats.
[00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:43.697]  I think Alex and I have quite a lot in common.
[00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:46.579]  I hope that you will find this satisfactory.
[00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.080]  We will be taking calls throughout the program.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.002]  Of course, if you don't know the number, it is 800-259-9231.
[00:01:51.022 --> 00:01:51.082]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:53.583]  Still a lot of information now coming about the Bin Laden tape.
[00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.353]  The Goldstein tape, we will be talking about that during the program.
[00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:21.167]  Also, the Prime Minister, President of Syria, Assad, says he sees a global plot over Lebanon, talks about the New World Order, uses that term specifically as it relates to the United Nations.
[00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:22.388]  We're going to talk about that.
[00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:27.450]  Also on today's program, what are all these mining accidents about?
[00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.911]  Notice suddenly there is a rash of mining accidents.
[00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:34.373]  I think we are up to three in the last 30 days.
[00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:37.074]  What could possibly be behind that?
[00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:38.875]  Could it be more cronyism?
[00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.672]  We are going to get to that on today's program.
[00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:44.273]  Google versus the government.
[00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.914]  We will break down that phony dog and pony show.
[00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:50.915]  Of course, Google being made out to be the good guy.
[00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.296]  And isn't that very timely?
[00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:57.798]  Also, Iran sanctions could drive oil past $100 a barrel.
[00:02:57.898 --> 00:03:02.940]  Of course, that's going to hit you folks in every sector of society.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.961]  As gas goes up, so does everything else.
[00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:09.842]  Halliburton is cited in Iraq contamination.
[00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:11.562]  We're going to try to get to that story today.
[00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:24.726]  Of course, Larry Franklin, last Friday I believe, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for espionage, spying, passing state secrets to Israel.
[00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:25.966]  We'll try to get to that.
[00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:30.047]  The top secret Navy file was found in a pub
[00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:33.035]  That's very odd.
[00:03:33.115 --> 00:03:44.794]  Yes, a top-secret Navy file from Great Britain from the Royal Navy detailing warships top-secret Middle East tour of duty has been found lying on a pub table.
[00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.051]  I wonder if it was in a largely Muslim neighborhood that that pub happened to be located.
[00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:53.331]  We're going to try to get to that today.
[00:03:53.351 --> 00:04:02.514]  A big election story as the Washington Post now seems to understand the complexities of e-voting and Debold specifically.
[00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:04.154]  We'll try to get to that today.
[00:04:05.163 --> 00:04:06.944]  Saddam has a new judge.
[00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:08.064]  He is Kurdish.
[00:04:08.584 --> 00:04:11.865]  That doesn't bode well for Saddam Hussein.
[00:04:11.905 --> 00:04:13.006]  We will talk about that.
[00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:19.368]  A Russian general says 9-11 is a globalist inside job.
[00:04:20.048 --> 00:04:31.532]  Are you getting the picture, folks, that more and more people are starting to understand exactly what we're up against, including generals and heads of states and, as we talked about, Assad from Syria.
[00:04:32.808 --> 00:04:34.869]  Presidents and leaders of nation.
[00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:39.031]  A lot of news to cover, a lot of information and your calls.
[00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:40.992]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:41.012 --> 00:04:43.513]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:45.895]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.615]  We'll be right back after these messages.
[00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:05.200]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:07.042]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.382 --> 00:05:12.066]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:19.192]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:21.454]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.496]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.597 --> 00:05:29.261]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:33.865]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:41.331]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.013]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.173 --> 00:05:45.895]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:10.419]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:21.907]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.927 --> 00:06:24.749]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:31.576]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:33.618]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:39.845]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:45.731]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:49.998]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:50.018 --> 00:06:50.719]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:51.741]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.361]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:07.662]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[00:07:08.042 --> 00:07:11.544]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:15.485]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:20.727]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:26.870]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.892]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:33.313]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:39.416]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:41.018]  TriVortex is amazing.
[00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:42.459]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:47.986]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[00:07:48.186 --> 00:07:51.650]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.
[00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:53.232]  Or call my friend Brian at 619-884-1455.
[00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:53.552]  That's 619-884-1455.
[00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:05.992]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.674]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.974 --> 00:08:14.779]  That is certainly what it's about.
[00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:17.901]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:19.563]  The minds of your family.
[00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:21.264]  The minds of your community.
[00:08:21.324 --> 00:08:22.185]  Of your co-workers.
[00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:22.985]  Of your friends.
[00:08:24.226 --> 00:08:25.888]  Of the people walking down the street.
[00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:26.308]  That's right.
[00:08:26.328 --> 00:08:28.910]  They don't want you to think for yourself.
[00:08:29.562 --> 00:08:33.566]  And of course we're talking about the establishment, both global and otherwise.
[00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:39.851]  And that's the refreshing thing about a program such as this and a network such as Genesis Communications.
[00:08:40.732 --> 00:08:42.573]  You are allowed to think for yourself.
[00:08:42.613 --> 00:08:50.340]  We're not in the business of spoon-feeding you information, telling you what to think, forcing our opinions down your gullets.
[00:08:51.084 --> 00:09:02.952]  We ultimately want to open your eyes, put some things on the record that aren't getting on the record, things that you might say are below the fold, so to speak, and allow you to come to your own conclusions.
[00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:06.875]  And a little common sense goes an awfully long way, doesn't it?
[00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:14.881]  It's the old adage, 19 hijackers with box cutters cannot smash apart buildings.
[00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:18.644]  In fact, the most well-protected buildings on the planet Earth.
[00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:22.688]  Common sense tells you there is something wrong with that picture.
[00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:25.611]  Of course, I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:27.332]  No, you don't have the wrong program.
[00:09:27.372 --> 00:09:32.197]  You are tuned in to the right program, and we have a lot to offer for you today.
[00:09:32.677 --> 00:09:35.699]  I want to start off with this Osama Bin Laden tape.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:45.928]  I was speaking about this on my program the other day, and found it interesting that Fox News always spells Osama, Osama, that is USA Ma.
[00:09:45.948 --> 00:09:47.869]  It's like the old Seinfeld episode.
[00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.614]  USA, that is the mother, USA, of all intelligence.
[00:09:54.014 --> 00:09:55.275]  You know, some might dispute that.
[00:09:56.338 --> 00:09:59.721]  Actually coordinating the movements of Al-Syeda.
[00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:06.446]  Maybe that's what Fox News is trying to tell us by spelling that with a U. Of course, we call him Emanuel Goldstein.
[00:10:07.067 --> 00:10:13.392]  Right on cue, the Goldstein tape comes out right when George W. Bush needs him the most.
[00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:16.074]  I mean, isn't that the most common sense
[00:10:16.714 --> 00:10:19.956]  issue, the most common sense component of this whole tape.
[00:10:19.976 --> 00:10:26.380]  Of course, remember the last time we heard from Mr. Goldstein was just a week prior to the 2004 elections.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:45.972]  Now when George W. Bush's poll numbers are through the basement, when he is being taken to task on any number of scandals, including the NSA spying, illegal spying, on law-abiding American citizens and protesters and activists, here comes Emmanuel Goldstein, aka Osama bin Laden.
[00:10:47.416 --> 00:10:52.019]  And the previous inconsistencies on this, but part of which, the timeline.
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:01.086]  Nothing really mentioned to indicate a timeline in the Bin Laden tape, other than the fact that he mentions Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:11:02.247 --> 00:11:13.275]  You would think that if this tape was being made in a rear, I guess a more recent point of view, we would have heard, I guess, some more recent historical indicators.
[00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:16.237]  We did not in the Osama Bin Laden tape.
[00:11:17.193 --> 00:11:26.856]  Of course, the story goes they have to ride this thing by mule for 6 months to Al Jazeera, where no one thought to wait for any said tapes.
[00:11:27.885 --> 00:11:41.229]  A 24-hour verification, and let's keep in mind, folks, there is no verification of any of these tapes, whether they're from Zohiri, whether they're from Zakawi, whether they're from Bin Laden, whoever they're from.
[00:11:41.289 --> 00:11:49.012]  There really can't be a verification, because again, technology and morphing has taken us to such a point.
[00:11:49.781 --> 00:11:59.251]  That even the CIA can't really get out in front of a tape and say, hey, this is absolutely 100% an actual Bin Laden tape.
[00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:09.402]  But this doesn't stop the mainstream media talking heads, screaming heads, from maybe taking it a little farther, maybe filling in a few blanks.
[00:12:10.203 --> 00:12:14.685]  Indicating that this is possibly, no, this is definitely Bin Laden.
[00:12:14.725 --> 00:12:17.106]  I think the CIA usually stops a little short of that.
[00:12:17.426 --> 00:12:31.432]  And of course, as we talked about earlier, the timing of President Bush needing his friend Bin Laden to come along right when the Patriot Act is set to expire, right when the NSA spying is at hand, and certainly when his polls have dipped.
[00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:34.894]  We've watched his polls actually go up since this has happened.
[00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:46.023]  Because, of course, the dumbed-down sheeple who are afraid, who need protection from their government, whom they trust implicitly, love to be protected.
[00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:48.044]  And this is exactly what's going on, folks.
[00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:51.246]  George W. Bush is going to protect us.
[00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:55.769]  If you believe that, then we've really got a lot of work to do with you.
[00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:59.892]  Well, this is a recent analysis by a Duke professor.
[00:13:00.172 --> 00:13:04.595]  He says he's doubtful about Thursday's audio tape from Osama bin Laden.
[00:13:05.276 --> 00:13:06.357]  He's Bruce Lawrence.
[00:13:06.397 --> 00:13:16.890]  He's just published Messages to the World, the statements of Osama Bin Laden, a book translating Bin Laden's writing, and he's very skeptical of Thursday's message.
[00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:21.112]  It was like a voice from the grave, Lawrence said.
[00:13:21.732 --> 00:13:25.273]  He thinks Bin Laden is dead and has doubts about the tape.
[00:13:25.614 --> 00:13:33.076]  Lawrence recently analyzed more than 20 complete speeches and interviews of the Al-Qaeda leader for his book.
[00:13:33.116 --> 00:13:36.537]  He says the new message is missing several key elements.
[00:13:38.118 --> 00:13:41.759]  There's nothing in this from the Koran, he writes.
[00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:46.792]  He is by his own standards a fateful Muslim, Lawrence said.
[00:13:47.012 --> 00:13:49.414]  He quotes scripture in defense of his actions.
[00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:58.122]  There's no quotation from the Koran in the excerpts we got, no reference to specific events, no reference to past atrocities.
[00:13:59.604 --> 00:14:07.511]  While the CIA confirms the voice on the tape is Bin Laden's, again with just enough plausible deniability to get them out of
[00:14:08.542 --> 00:14:15.374]  Any sticky wickets, and we have to remember also George W. Bush has not commented word one on this tape.
[00:14:15.434 --> 00:14:19.061]  Again, waiting to see if this floats, making sure that he doesn't get caught.
[00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:24.516]  Again, the confirmations are very shaky.
[00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:25.457]  A lot of indicators.
[00:14:25.777 --> 00:14:27.538]  Lawrence questions when it was recorded.
[00:14:27.578 --> 00:14:34.122]  He says the timing of the release could be an action to divert attention from last week's U.S.
[00:14:34.242 --> 00:14:35.543]  airstrike in Pakistan.
[00:14:35.783 --> 00:14:39.646]  The strike targeted Bin Laden's deputy, al-Zawahiri.
[00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:43.863]  And killed four leading Al-Qaeda figures along with civilians.
[00:14:43.903 --> 00:14:44.963]  We've all heard that story.
[00:14:45.023 --> 00:14:52.046]  Now, various reports coming out about that story, including other former captured or dead or mistaken terrorists.
[00:14:52.446 --> 00:14:54.267]  It all kind of comes together, folks.
[00:14:54.527 --> 00:15:05.672]  Lawrence Bulley's faulty Pakistani intelligence led to the strike and the civilian deaths when the tape was leaked by Pakistani authorities to divert attention from their mistake.
[00:15:06.232 --> 00:15:09.774]  This makes it very easy, of course, folks, to blame the Pakistanis.
[00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:13.181]  over this tape if it does turn out to be fake.
[00:15:14.002 --> 00:15:22.271]  It led to a failed military operation where America got blamed, but they are people who really like to blame anyone else.
[00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:25.494]  They're the ones who provided the intelligence, of course, Lawrence said.
[00:15:26.323 --> 00:15:30.904]  I think this is an effort to say we are not going to look at this terrible incident that happened.
[00:15:30.924 --> 00:15:34.745]  Another element that Lawrence takes issue with is Bin Laden's latest message.
[00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:36.345]  Its length is only 10 minutes.
[00:15:36.705 --> 00:15:39.945]  Previously, the shortest was 18 minutes.
[00:15:40.245 --> 00:15:42.446]  Now this is again a Duke professor.
[00:15:42.486 --> 00:15:45.646]  This isn't some internet researcher somewhere.
[00:15:45.706 --> 00:15:54.048]  A Duke professor, highly accredited, is writing a book on Osama Bin Laden, has been listening to Bin Laden tapes, analyzing and coming up with patterns
[00:15:54.668 --> 00:16:07.812]  For the prior tapes alleged to be Osama Bin Laden has a lot of problems with this and of course again perfect timing when we're in this big mess in Pakistan which by the way is starting to iron out.
[00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:17.715]  What we're starting to hear now is that yes Al-Zahiri went running away from a house while it was being bombed.
[00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:21.996]  Of course initially these reports from Pakistan stated that
[00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:25.353]  We killed a lot of innocent women and children.
[00:16:25.393 --> 00:16:30.436]  It's really kind of par for the course, a daily activity with the Coalition of the Killing.
[00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:34.819]  But we bombed the wrong target.
[00:16:35.239 --> 00:16:48.167]  Pakistan was extremely upset, but this story is now, speaking of morphing, this story is now morphing into a more complex tale of open conspiracy in Pakistan.
[00:16:51.909 --> 00:17:15.577]  One of the characters involved in this, of course, the one that tipped off the fact that al-Zahiri was in Pakistan at this house, which could have instigated this Bin Laden tape, again, making full circle, was the gentleman who was captured, well, roughly about six months ago, and whose name didn't match up with the actual terrorist they were supposed to catch.
[00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:19.419]  It was a, you know, this is what they always do, folks, they always catch the number two guy, don't they?
[00:17:20.354 --> 00:17:26.859]  I think next week they'll catch another number two guy or the number three guy in the various departments of Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:40.008]  So, former phony assets coming together with new assets, creating the illusion of Osama Bin Laden, snapping Americans right back into line.
[00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:45.611]  And if it wasn't so transparent, it would actually be a little bit funny.
[00:17:46.132 --> 00:17:49.354]  If it wasn't so dangerous, it might be a little bit funny.
[00:17:50.535 --> 00:17:53.077]  But all in all, we're being taken for suckers!
[00:17:53.217 --> 00:17:54.598]  It's just that simple, folks.
[00:17:55.398 --> 00:18:14.992]  They assume that we don't read newspapers, they assume that you don't listen to radio programs such as this, they assume that you don't read, that you are spoon-fed news from establishment media, and that you'll never connect the dots, and then they assume that if you do connect the dots, you'll be in such a small minority that you really won't be able to raise your voice.
[00:18:15.032 --> 00:18:18.895]  And of course, constant monitoring of you in case you do raise your voice
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.961]  Is the era that we live in.
[00:18:23.342 --> 00:18:24.663]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:18:24.683 --> 00:18:27.864]  So I'm sure none of you have fallen for the Osama Bin Laden tape.
[00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:34.108]  You're welcome to call in today's program and give us any more information you might have or any comments on that.
[00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:36.109]  Now going to this Assad story.
[00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:38.450]  Sees a global plot over Lebanon.
[00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:44.373]  President Bashir al-Assad returned to the offensive yesterday over serious ties with Lebanon.
[00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:52.395]  Saying the deterioration of relations between Beirut and Syria was due to a quote, global plot against the Arab world.
[00:18:52.956 --> 00:19:03.980]  What is happening between Syria and Lebanon is part of a global plot against all Arabs which has many facets, Assad told a conference of Arab legal groups and unions in Damascus.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.482]  Assad's typically combative and nationalist address was
[00:19:07.882 --> 00:19:16.209]  Frequently interrupted by delegates shouting paeans of praise to the Syrian leader, some of which prompted chanting and standing ovations.
[00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:25.878]  The Syrian president said he was in favor of the UN Commission of Inquiry into the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri.
[00:19:26.593 --> 00:19:30.234]  Continuing its work, but on a legal and not a political basis.
[00:19:30.274 --> 00:19:45.858]  And that's kind of shocking, folks, to think that he would be in favor of this UN Commission led by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, which ultimately has pinned the murder of Hariri on Assad.
[00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:47.979]  Very interesting, quite a conundrum.
[00:19:47.999 --> 00:19:54.681]  We're going to continue with this story and other news on today's program, The Alex Jones Show, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.051]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:07.154]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:07.434 --> 00:20:11.577]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:12.018 --> 00:20:12.838]  So what do you do?
[00:20:13.159 --> 00:20:17.743]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:18.223 --> 00:20:20.345]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:21.686]  Sheltering in place.

[00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:13.842]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:21:14.818 --> 00:21:21.600]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:21:22.521 --> 00:21:23.961]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:21:24.181 --> 00:21:27.242]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?

[00:23:01.812 --> 00:23:04.174]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:23:04.414 --> 00:23:06.435]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:23:06.595 --> 00:23:13.639]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:22.505]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:51.983]  Try Pure Soap once and I'll guarantee you'll never use anything else.
[00:24:22.089 --> 00:24:32.314]  We're talking about Bashar al-Assad from Syria, President Assad.
[00:24:33.294 --> 00:24:35.536]  Very interesting speeches he's been making.
[00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:43.880]  You can't really get through a month, folks, without some global leader or generals talking about the New World Order.
[00:24:43.941 --> 00:24:48.424]  Don't let people tell you that you're crazy to use a term like the New World Order.
[00:24:48.725 --> 00:24:54.890]  Because this term is being used consistently in every country on every continent in the world.
[00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:00.835]  We remember, looking back now, about two or three months, a joint statement by China and Russia
[00:25:01.355 --> 00:25:08.059]  Saying that the world would be better off with a new world order, they say, which would be run by the United Nations.
[00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:13.321]  Don't let people tell you that Russia and China have a problem with the United Nations.
[00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:15.322]  They love the United Nations.
[00:25:15.803 --> 00:25:18.864]  And apparently so does Assad, which just doesn't make any sense.
[00:25:19.204 --> 00:25:26.168]  This is where we get into a pretty clear channel of just working together.
[00:25:26.934 --> 00:25:28.255]  These people work together.
[00:25:28.495 --> 00:25:35.419]  They all seem to be on the same page, yet outwardly, and in the news, we constantly hear of these conflicts.
[00:25:37.781 --> 00:25:44.865]  Assad went on to say, total cooperation with the UN Commission must be made while respecting principles of national sovereignty.
[00:25:45.225 --> 00:25:47.707]  That is what you would call an oxymoron, folks.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.943]  The neutrality and inquiry on a legal basis.
[00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:57.508]  National sovereignty is the strongest thing, and not UN resolutions, Assad said.
[00:25:57.528 --> 00:26:00.491]  So he doesn't appear to be all the way on board with the United Nations.
[00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:04.194]  And if he is, in reality, a sovereign country, why would he be?
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:11.744]  Again, speaking in front of a backdrop which read, Defending Syria is national duty in English and Arabic.
[00:26:12.044 --> 00:26:23.451]  Syria has come under sustained international pressure for change following the February 2005 murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, which was widely blamed on Damascus.
[00:26:23.972 --> 00:26:27.134]  Assad has vehemently denied responsibility for the Hariri murder.
[00:26:27.774 --> 00:26:32.275]  And a string of other political assassinations, too, that hit Lebanon over the past year.
[00:26:32.315 --> 00:26:34.815]  In fact, a major whistleblower came out.
[00:26:34.896 --> 00:26:37.736]  This wasn't, again, covered in the mainstream media.
[00:26:37.776 --> 00:26:40.497]  He was immediately bought off, apparently.
[00:26:40.597 --> 00:26:42.757]  He came and went just as fast as he came.
[00:26:43.077 --> 00:26:49.639]  And he said he was in on the plot to kill Hariri, and it was not Assad, and it was not Lebanon that did it.
[00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:52.679]  In fact, it was the usual suspects.
[00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:56.660]  This is the more interesting part of the speech, which I was trying to get to.
[00:26:58.119 --> 00:27:03.750]  Syrian President charges Israel was behind the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's death.
[00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:06.755]  Said the world failed to intervene.
[00:27:06.856 --> 00:27:10.102]  Again, Israel assassinated Arafat.
[00:27:11.121 --> 00:27:19.953]  Assad makes this statement in the wake of talks with Iran's president in which Syria voiced support for Iran and its right to obtain nuclear capabilities.
[00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:29.345]  He went on to say Israel has denied being responsible for the deterioration in Arafat's death before his death and has denied poisoning him.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:36.986]  Very, very strong rhetoric, which in a way he should know might put him in an even more bigger of a pinch.
[00:27:37.566 --> 00:27:46.313]  In his speech, Assad also referred to the Palestinian issue and claimed the current international situation does not allow for peace negotiations to go forward.
[00:27:46.353 --> 00:27:47.294]  The President also
[00:27:47.754 --> 00:27:49.075]  We're good to go.
[00:28:11.724 --> 00:28:25.807]  It was not Israel's failure to comply with the Arab demands that impeded the peace process, as Assad said, but rather the forces operating within the new global order and the international community which backed out on its commitment to peace.
[00:28:26.147 --> 00:28:38.810]  Maybe Assad doesn't understand that the peace, the world peace, that's going to come through the world government with the global economy and the locked and loaded global currency
[00:28:40.012 --> 00:28:42.773]  Hinges upon massive chaos.
[00:28:43.754 --> 00:28:44.774]  So he had it right.
[00:28:45.354 --> 00:28:46.735]  You know, that's the fact, folks.
[00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:50.096]  These people believe in what they're doing.
[00:28:50.377 --> 00:28:51.017]  They're not...
[00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:53.482]  You know, having trouble sleeping at night.
[00:28:53.502 --> 00:28:55.362]  I know a lot of you might be worried about that.
[00:28:55.422 --> 00:29:01.585]  These New World Order Neo-Pharaohs, as I call them, or Matrix Moles, having a problem sleeping at night.
[00:29:01.665 --> 00:29:10.888]  No, because what they believe in their utopian Fabian Socialist mentality, ultimately, is that everything is going to turn out fine.
[00:29:11.028 --> 00:29:12.629]  They know better than you.
[00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:15.130]  That's why they're trying to stop you to think for yourself.
[00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:26.359]  Obviously, a rational man or woman that begins using their brain, and they start to think, instantly recognizes that their government is out for blood.
[00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:29.101]  That they are liars, that they are murderers.
[00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:33.124]  In fact, to quote Bill Hicks, all governments are murderers and liars.
[00:29:33.825 --> 00:29:35.306]  That's why they don't want you to think for yourself.
[00:29:35.346 --> 00:29:35.826]  Folks, stay tuned.
[00:29:35.846 --> 00:29:36.467]  We'll come right back.
[00:29:36.507 --> 00:29:37.468]  Go right to your calls.
[00:29:37.668 --> 00:29:40.070]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:54.443]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.384 --> 00:29:58.049]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.466 --> 00:30:05.768]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:11.391]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[00:30:11.631 --> 00:30:13.512]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.
[00:30:13.832 --> 00:30:18.375]  Vitamir has created unique and natural patented formulas that set them apart from any other oral hygiene products.
[00:30:18.575 --> 00:30:24.998]  The folks at Vitamir have blended zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and clove oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath and fight gum disease.
[00:30:25.199 --> 00:30:31.382]  Good health starts in your mouth, and regular use of Vitamir Toothpaste and Mouthwash is a powerful front-line defense against gingivitis, bleeding gums,
[00:30:31.562 --> 00:30:35.543]  And folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just-from-the-dentist-office feeling.
[00:30:35.763 --> 00:30:39.123]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.
[00:30:39.364 --> 00:30:40.824]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:41.264 --> 00:30:46.305]  That's 677-817-9829, and order Vitamir mouthwash and toothpaste today.
[00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:49.125]  He'll be glad you did, and so will that special someone in your life.
[00:30:49.325 --> 00:30:53.766]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Vitamir oral hygiene products today.
[00:30:54.086 --> 00:30:57.587]  Try Vitamir, and you'll feel that squeaky clean sensation others just talk about.
[00:31:01.246 --> 00:31:04.268]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.588 --> 00:31:09.511]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.772 --> 00:31:14.114]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.415 --> 00:31:23.320]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.541 --> 00:31:27.143]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.443 --> 00:31:32.469]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.769 --> 00:31:39.517]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:39.978 --> 00:31:40.539]  What about you?
[00:31:41.278 --> 00:31:46.640]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:49.742]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.301]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America today.
[00:32:05.741 --> 00:32:09.203]  In 25% of the cases, the first sign is sudden death.
[00:32:09.663 --> 00:32:12.884]  Cardivite has been helping people live as long as God intended us.
[00:32:13.284 --> 00:32:17.865]  Made from seven herbs, cardivite is the purest form of oral chelation available today.
[00:32:17.885 --> 00:32:19.846]  Here's what one person has to say.
[00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:23.869]  I was feeling chest pain from time to time, shortness of breath.
[00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:27.853]  I don't have the tightness of my chest, and I don't have that shortness of breath no more.
[00:32:28.053 --> 00:32:29.254]  I tried all kinds of junk.
[00:32:29.454 --> 00:32:29.975]  It didn't do.
[00:32:30.075 --> 00:32:32.076]  The only thing that worked was your Cardivite.
[00:32:32.457 --> 00:32:34.799]  If you believe Cardivite was made for you, call 1-877-928-8822.
[00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:35.419]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:52.535]  That's H-E-A-R-T-D-R-O-P dot com.
[00:32:52.936 --> 00:32:55.979]  Cartabyte is an all-natural supplement, so call today 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:07.148 --> 00:33:10.410]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:15.173]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex today, tomorrow, and the next day.
[00:33:36.836 --> 00:33:38.158]  I'm doing my show as well.
[00:33:38.178 --> 00:33:49.791]  It'll be five hours of news broadcast per day for me, which is a pretty good exercise, and I will be pretty well informed, if I haven't been already, fourteen hours from now.
[00:33:51.177 --> 00:33:52.337]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:33:52.417 --> 00:33:57.699]  Alex should be back on Thursday and it's just you and I together today.
[00:33:57.719 --> 00:33:59.979]  We're going to take a lot of calls, cover a lot of news.
[00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:13.903]  I really want to go to this mining story and the Halliburton story, but before we do, I want to go to these calls and we're going to be doing a full hour of Second Amendment issues with Richard Pearson, Executive Director of Illinois State Rifle Association.
[00:34:14.123 --> 00:34:17.644]  We'll be talking about these Floyd cards that they have up there that they are trying to foil
[00:34:18.761 --> 00:34:22.345]  And also Aaron Zellman, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[00:34:22.385 --> 00:34:26.469]  We have a big special on Innocence Betrayed, which we'll let you know about today as well.
[00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:28.772]  That'll be coming up in the second hour of today's broadcast.
[00:34:29.012 --> 00:34:30.353]  Let's go to these phones, 800-259-9231.
[00:34:30.474 --> 00:34:36.079]  We're going to try to get everybody in in this half hour that is currently holding.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.502]  Let's first go to Mark in Boston.
[00:34:38.582 --> 00:34:39.743]  Mark, thank you for joining us.
[00:34:39.803 --> 00:34:40.985]  You are on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:43.167]  How are you doing, Jack?
[00:34:43.527 --> 00:34:44.769]  I'm very well, thanks.
[00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.331]  My question is this.
[00:34:47.571 --> 00:34:51.736]  Let me start by saying I'm someone who does not believe that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:34:53.998 --> 00:34:59.043]  Do you believe the version of events put forth by the government then?
[00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:00.024]  More or less.
[00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:08.303]  And have you had an opportunity to read the vast amounts of research regarding 9-11?
[00:35:08.343 --> 00:35:12.506]  Well, I've surfed somewhat Alex's site.
[00:35:12.646 --> 00:35:15.208]  I've read mostly David Rick Griffin's book.
[00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:17.650]  His last one, his second one.
[00:35:19.187 --> 00:35:24.208]  Well, folks, maybe people will help me out here, but this isn't really uncommon.
[00:35:24.228 --> 00:35:37.311]  We are actually in the minority, I'm sure you understand, though that minority is growing rapidly every day and includes some of the top people in the Bush administration, Reagan administration.
[00:35:37.331 --> 00:35:42.072]  I mean, this isn't something that is internet conspiracy theory at this point.
[00:35:42.112 --> 00:35:45.173]  We have a lot of top-level people like Morgan Reynolds,
[00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:49.026]  And many others have come out to say they don't believe it.
[00:35:49.066 --> 00:35:56.027]  We've had physics professors come out and say there's no possible way those fires or those airplanes knocked down those buildings.
[00:35:56.287 --> 00:36:00.628]  Have you seen the video of the buildings falling like they've been imploded?
[00:36:00.648 --> 00:36:04.428]  Does that not make you scratch your head a little bit there, Mark?
[00:36:04.848 --> 00:36:09.109]  Well, let me get to some of the reasons why I don't think bombs brought down those buildings.
[00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:12.209]  One is that, well, it's actually in the form of a question.
[00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.210]  My theory is this, or my idea is this.
[00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:22.494]  The buildings obviously came down at the point of impact of where those planes entered the buildings.
[00:36:22.974 --> 00:36:24.195]  So my question to you is this.
[00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:41.578]  They're not highly engineered, obviously they're highly engineered, planted explosives at those points where the plane impacted have been so damaged that they would not have been successful in bringing down the building.
[00:36:42.426 --> 00:36:50.009]  Well, look, we've got eyewitnesses inside the World Trade Center, one of which was decorated by Bush for being a hero and saving many lives.
[00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:51.630]  His name is William Rodriguez.
[00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:56.811]  He's one of many that heard bombs going off in the sub-basements of that building.
[00:36:57.132 --> 00:37:00.693]  If you look at the schematical infrastructure of the buildings,
[00:37:01.033 --> 00:37:05.697]  You would find, and this is why, you know, top physics professors are coming out, Mark, and saying they don't buy it.
[00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:13.243]  You would find that it was virtually impossible for the buildings not only to have fallen, but to have fallen in the way, shape, and form that they have.
[00:37:13.343 --> 00:37:24.172]  Now, tomorrow's program, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and tomorrow's show we'll have Eric Huffschmidt, who has done some incredible research into the actual schematical designs of the buildings.
[00:37:24.412 --> 00:37:28.273]  Now, that being said, we don't want to fall into a red herring, do we, Mark?
[00:37:28.353 --> 00:37:37.754]  I mean, I don't know if any of us are here to say we can prove without a shadow of a doubt that there were bombs put in those buildings or remote controls put in the airplanes.
[00:37:37.974 --> 00:37:44.115]  What we've been trying to say all along is that the official story from the government cannot possibly make sense.
[00:37:44.155 --> 00:37:45.196]  It does not add up.
[00:37:45.936 --> 00:37:49.076]  Well, I'll get to Rodriguez in a second, but I want to go back to the point I just made.
[00:37:49.436 --> 00:37:50.817]  Am I being irrational?
[00:37:50.877 --> 00:37:53.037]  Am I being illogical to assume
[00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:55.988]  That is 767 going into that building.
[00:37:56.468 --> 00:38:05.516]  I would submit this to you, that if you had... Ask any engineer, I have not done this, but ask any engineer who's going to plant explosives to bring down a building.
[00:38:05.877 --> 00:38:08.279]  In a traditional sense, obviously, in a non-conspiratorial sense.
[00:38:09.473 --> 00:38:12.475]  You understand, common sense has to prevail here.
[00:38:12.535 --> 00:38:24.324]  First of all, I've interviewed people on my program that threw me astounding information, including back in 1976, Timothy McNiven was working on a war game
[00:38:24.924 --> 00:38:38.408]  To cancel out or to contraryly fight any potential Muslims who might be using, specifically now, box cutters and airplanes to take down the World Trade Center.
[00:38:38.428 --> 00:38:39.669]  So that's very fishy.
[00:38:39.989 --> 00:38:40.769]  Okay, right there.
[00:38:40.989 --> 00:38:48.411]  I've also interviewed people who have said that everybody in the World Trade Center were called out for some type of electronical repairs.
[00:38:48.471 --> 00:38:50.292]  They all stayed home for a few days.
[00:38:50.592 --> 00:38:53.293]  And at that point, I guess you could have wired the building.
[00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:54.573]  But again, you're taking us
[00:38:54.773 --> 00:38:55.373]  We're good to go.
[00:39:17.568 --> 00:39:34.645]  I think it was about a year ago, there was an official report that came out again, a government report that said that the planes did not bring down the buildings, and neither did the jet fuel from the planes, but it was actually the paper and the furniture inside the buildings that brought down the World Trade Center towers.
[00:39:35.226 --> 00:39:38.088]  Well, though, is it really common sense to believe that?
[00:39:38.148 --> 00:39:39.310]  You mentioned a couple of days.
[00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.291]  Is it common sense
[00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:46.414]  To believe that in a couple of days you could line two of the tallest buildings in the world.
[00:39:46.434 --> 00:39:49.515]  We're not even talking... set aside... Again, that's a red herring.
[00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:52.056]  I'm just throwing out some of the information that we have.
[00:39:52.116 --> 00:39:54.037]  No, I don't think we know definitively.
[00:39:54.077 --> 00:39:58.499]  In fact, I've talked to firefighters that say the building was built with C4 in it.
[00:39:58.999 --> 00:40:00.920]  That these buildings were built to be blown.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.721]  You understand?
[00:40:02.961 --> 00:40:03.201]  Yeah.
[00:40:03.762 --> 00:40:06.423]  So, I mean, if you look at... here's something that's very interesting.
[00:40:07.891 --> 00:40:32.424]  I don't know if you've seen any of Alex Jones' videos, but I really encourage you to get the latest video that Alex has produced, and we're going to promote that here in this hour, where he goes into a nice monologue showing how the Bankers Trust building, which was right next to the World Trade Center, literally parts falling on it did not fall, yet across the plaza, Building 7 fell with no real flames or no real, I guess,
[00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:37.046]  answers as to how it fell, and why it fell, and why it felt like it was imploded.
[00:40:37.106 --> 00:40:43.429]  Even Dan Rather, commenting live when Building 7 fell, said again, it looked like a controlled demolition.
[00:40:43.449 --> 00:40:45.050]  I mean, this is the thing.
[00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.731]  You may not want to believe it.
[00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:48.452]  Look, I don't want to believe it.
[00:40:48.472 --> 00:41:00.298]  There's nothing more I would like, Mark, to think than we were all extremely wrong, that there are some evil terrorists out there, and we can somehow solve the problem by going after these terrorists, and of course taking away your rights in order to do that.
[00:41:00.318 --> 00:41:00.758]  Okay?
[00:41:01.378 --> 00:41:06.604]  I almost would rather believe that than to believe that my own government was somehow complicit.
[00:41:06.985 --> 00:41:09.948]  And I don't think, I don't fall into the, they just let it happen.
[00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:11.810]  They stood by and let it happen.
[00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.071]  It was controlled blowback.
[00:41:13.392 --> 00:41:15.874]  I'm of the position that they made that happen.
[00:41:16.215 --> 00:41:20.419]  And of course, we have to always look at who benefits in a situation like that.
[00:41:20.439 --> 00:41:22.482]  Did Osama Bin Laden benefit, Mark?
[00:41:22.982 --> 00:41:25.366]  Well, let me get to what you said about Rodriguez.
[00:41:25.386 --> 00:41:35.944]  Now, we know that whatever Rodriguez heard, whatever it is that he heard, obviously not the bombs that brought down the building because those bombs went off at least an hour before the building fell and that was in the basement!
[00:41:36.684 --> 00:41:41.730]  And of course, the buildings fell not from the bottom down, but from the point of impact down.
[00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.833]  Are you keeping an open mind, Mark?
[00:41:43.873 --> 00:41:47.236]  Let me ask you that, because again, I'm not sure you've seen all of the information.
[00:41:47.277 --> 00:41:49.379]  It seems like... You see, here's what I'm trying to do, Mark.
[00:41:49.459 --> 00:41:51.001]  I'm trying to keep an open mind here.
[00:41:51.301 --> 00:41:56.968]  So if you can bring me information that will back up the government's story, then I want to hear it.
[00:41:57.308 --> 00:41:58.609]  But that works both ways.
[00:41:58.689 --> 00:42:02.570]  You have to be open and use a little common sense as well.
[00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:11.094]  Now, we have no pictures of the terrorists, and this show wasn't supposed to be about 9-11 folks, but Mark asked, and I think we have an obligation to work with Mark.
[00:42:11.114 --> 00:42:16.896]  We're going to let you guys get in, and Mark, if you stay on the air, you can hear some of the listeners' responses, because I know they're going to want to talk to you.
[00:42:17.376 --> 00:42:19.759]  But, again, does it make sense?
[00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:22.161]  There are no pictures of the terrorists.
[00:42:22.442 --> 00:42:28.048]  There are no terrorists, or no Muslims, or none of these Muslims on the manifest list of the planes.
[00:42:28.088 --> 00:42:32.272]  The planes were one-third full, leaving New York, Boston, and D.C.
[00:42:32.392 --> 00:42:33.373]  on a Monday morning.
[00:42:33.613 --> 00:42:35.235]  Believe me, I've lived in New York.
[00:42:35.295 --> 00:42:37.598]  That is nearly impossible right there.
[00:42:37.998 --> 00:42:39.519]  There are a lot of inconsistencies.
[00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:53.831]  Now, when you factor in that these terrorists use box cutters to take over these planes, and I've interviewed Chick Burlingame's sister, Deborah Burlingame, she said he would fight to the death before he'd give up that combat, that cockpit.
[00:42:54.092 --> 00:43:02.539]  That he was a combat-ready Air Force officer, and you're telling me that a couple of Arabs with box cutters made him give up that plane?
[00:43:03.365 --> 00:43:11.767]  Well, obviously then you are one who does not believe that there were hijackers, because there are a multitude of views, and you're one who does not believe hijackers were on the airplanes at all.
[00:43:12.148 --> 00:43:14.308]  You know, look, that's something I believe.
[00:43:14.348 --> 00:43:18.529]  That is my opinion, and we're trying to work off of documents and facts here.
[00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:22.330]  Now, what was your response to Timothy McNiven again?
[00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.692]  He passed a lie detector on this, Mark, that they were working on war games back in 76 to combat
[00:43:28.512 --> 00:43:33.953]  Arabs with box cutters using airplanes to crash into the World Trade Center in the Pentagon.
[00:43:33.993 --> 00:43:40.395]  What do you think about the drills that they were running that morning that were doing exactly what the terrorists ended up doing?
[00:43:40.415 --> 00:43:43.175]  I mean, don't those issues raise questions with you?
[00:43:43.195 --> 00:43:47.136]  They do, particularly the war games.
[00:43:47.396 --> 00:43:53.458]  I myself would like to believe that I'm someone who takes in all the facts and I guess that's my point.
[00:43:54.902 --> 00:43:58.623]  It looks to me like you're driven by a motive here.
[00:43:58.663 --> 00:44:00.003]  You called into the program.
[00:44:00.443 --> 00:44:03.724]  I appreciate the fact that you do disagree with what we're talking about.
[00:44:03.744 --> 00:44:04.784]  We put you on first.
[00:44:05.164 --> 00:44:10.525]  But as I'm relating to you a number of facts, you don't seem to be working with the facts.
[00:44:10.565 --> 00:44:14.726]  You seem to be ready to go on to the next issue to defeat our case.
[00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:17.747]  So I'm curious as to what... Do you have a motive here, Mark?
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.542]  Well, no, my motive is simply that I don't believe this.
[00:44:23.942 --> 00:44:28.644]  I know that you do, as well as Alex Jones, and so I wanted to call you and ask you a few questions.
[00:44:28.724 --> 00:44:32.546]  I've spent four years, every day of those four years, studying this.
[00:44:33.909 --> 00:44:39.155]  I'm not going to say that I'm an expert or even that Alex Jones is an expert, though if anyone is, it is Alex Jones.
[00:44:39.435 --> 00:44:54.771]  But I've just given you roughly about a dozen facts that would say, that would give us any sense, using any bit of common sense, we would find, using some of the facts that I've just relayed to you, that the government story doesn't hold water.
[00:44:55.271 --> 00:44:55.912]  So why?
[00:44:56.092 --> 00:44:58.433]  And then of course we get into the whole cover-up thing.
[00:44:58.774 --> 00:45:01.776]  I'm sure, Mark, you've studied the whole issue of the cover-up.
[00:45:02.196 --> 00:45:09.020]  Of course, naming Henry Kissinger to be head of the investigation to find out what did happen on 9-11.
[00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:15.565]  The fact that most of the forensic evidence was shipped out and turned into ashtrays in China.
[00:45:15.905 --> 00:45:24.531]  I mean, if they really wanted to find out what happened on 9-11, they would have spent at least as much money as they spent trying to convict Bill Clinton on the blue dress.
[00:45:25.191 --> 00:45:26.292]  I mean, that doesn't add up.
[00:45:26.892 --> 00:45:30.896]  Well, obviously a lot of the evidence was shipped off, but much of it wasn't.
[00:45:30.916 --> 00:45:34.999]  Obviously, it was delivered to New Jersey, and I think it was the American Society of Civil Engineers.
[00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:38.762]  I think they were the first ones who had a stab at that, and of course afterwards in this.
[00:45:38.782 --> 00:45:42.224]  Do you think that there was a proper investigation into 9-11?
[00:45:43.806 --> 00:45:45.587]  Well, it seems to me there was.
[00:45:45.627 --> 00:45:48.349]  I don't think that there was anything out of the order in the investigation.
[00:45:48.369 --> 00:45:48.609]  Do you?
[00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.451]  Here's what I would do.
[00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:55.594]  You can stay tuned and listen to some of these other listeners, because I think they might want to take this on as well.
[00:45:55.834 --> 00:46:15.927]  But what I would do, if you have not seen 9-11, Road to Tyranny, if you have not seen the latest Alex Jones film, I would watch those and maybe again keep an open mind here, and I think that you would probably, if you are keeping an open mind, if you have an honest agenda or no agenda here, I think you'll probably open up to this a little bit.
[00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:22.550]  Because the problem is, I've just seen too much, so it's very difficult for me to be swayed now back the other way.
[00:46:22.791 --> 00:46:34.717]  I mean, after looking at this for hundreds and hundreds of hours, I gotta tell ya, I know one thing, I know one thing for sure, the government's cover story is a conspiracy theory, and that's why we have a problem with it.
[00:46:34.737 --> 00:46:35.697]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[00:46:35.717 --> 00:46:38.359]  Let's talk to Mike in Washington, is it?
[00:46:38.439 --> 00:46:39.880]  Mike, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.720]  Thank you for calling in.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.921]  Thank you, Jack.
[00:46:45.554 --> 00:46:47.996]  I have so many problems with the government's cover story.
[00:46:48.036 --> 00:46:56.964]  Now, if they were able to work with us a little bit on some of the issues, then perhaps, you know, we can give them a bit of a free ride, a benefit of the doubt.
[00:46:57.144 --> 00:47:05.991]  But they have stayed staunch on their initial report, which came out, what was it, 12 hours, 2 hours after the initial bombing.
[00:47:06.012 --> 00:47:07.593]  They knew immediately it was bin Laden.
[00:47:08.243 --> 00:47:10.204]  They had a passport that floated down.
[00:47:10.624 --> 00:47:12.005]  Again, this is misinformation.
[00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:21.311]  A passport that floated down from the burning towers that somebody found in the street in New York, which of course they retracted in the back page of some newspaper in London a year later.
[00:47:21.331 --> 00:47:22.271]  Yeah.
[00:47:22.511 --> 00:47:24.272]  We have a lot of problems with that story, don't we?
[00:47:24.652 --> 00:47:25.853]  We absolutely do, Jack.
[00:47:25.913 --> 00:47:29.255]  And, you know, it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure this out.
[00:47:29.575 --> 00:47:32.537]  I mean, their Wag the Dog story is pathetic.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:48.588]  One thing that, or several things that I might point out to the previous caller, Mark, is I smell a shill, but 8 of 19 of those box cutter wielding terrorists were turned up alive in other countries with respective jobs.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.721]  And I've used that before, and I appreciate you bringing that in, though.
[00:47:55.141 --> 00:47:58.342]  That is something that isn't... I don't believe that's solid.
[00:47:58.362 --> 00:48:00.223]  I don't believe that's 100% at this point.
[00:48:00.303 --> 00:48:03.604]  Okay, well, another thing to take into consideration is, who could wire the building?
[00:48:03.724 --> 00:48:05.844]  Marvin Bush, George W.'
[00:48:05.824 --> 00:48:09.885]  's little brother was the head of security for the Twin Towers and Boston Logan Airport.
[00:48:10.185 --> 00:48:14.766]  This is why they call it coincidence theories, because there are a lot of coincidences.
[00:48:14.986 --> 00:48:15.927]  Who would have time to do it?
[00:48:15.947 --> 00:48:17.087]  Well, Marvin could have wired it.
[00:48:17.498 --> 00:48:20.260]  Towers were vaporized and sent to Jersey.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:27.545]  You know, the pancake theory does not vaporize hundreds of tons of concrete, steel, and human flesh.
[00:48:29.286 --> 00:48:37.492]  And they removed the crime scene and the black boxes were also found by the FBI and the firefighters were told not to mention it and they were told to shut up.
[00:48:38.032 --> 00:48:38.793]  It doesn't take a
[00:48:41.067 --> 00:48:43.209]  A genius to realize this.
[00:48:43.569 --> 00:48:49.033]  The Bush administration was on Cipro a good two weeks before the terrorist attack.
[00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:49.993]  That is documented.
[00:48:50.013 --> 00:48:53.696]  And Cipro, of course, was the anecdote for anthrax.
[00:48:53.876 --> 00:48:55.577]  How did they know they were going to be anthraxed?
[00:48:55.777 --> 00:48:59.620]  And it came from our own lab.
[00:49:00.781 --> 00:49:07.085]  And Jeb Bush declared martial law on the 7th.
[00:49:07.565 --> 00:49:09.347]  Because he wasn't sure if it was going to be the 11th or the 7th.
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:25.071]  See, Mark did have a problem with the drills that were being run, which Richard Myers, Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted when Cynthia McKinney, Congressman Cynthia McKinney, asked him and Rumsfeld directly about the drills.
[00:49:25.111 --> 00:49:28.894]  That was the first time I remember him actually admitting it on the record.
[00:49:28.914 --> 00:49:32.517]  They were running the drills, but it was something else entirely different.
[00:49:32.617 --> 00:49:38.482]  It just happened to be drills to have hijackers go after the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.
[00:49:38.502 --> 00:49:39.763]  I mean, that's quite a coincidence.
[00:49:40.163 --> 00:49:42.485]  They did the same thing in London in the 7-7 bombings.
[00:49:42.505 --> 00:49:49.269]  They were running drills for exactly the terrorist event that happened the morning of July 7th.
[00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:52.872]  These are amazing coincidences.
[00:49:53.112 --> 00:49:59.456]  You would have to almost be a conspiracy theorist to believe in some of these coincidences that the government puts forth.
[00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:03.747]  Yeah, I think I smell a shill too.
[00:50:04.448 --> 00:50:12.356]  But I don't mind that, you know, I like when people call into our programs and they want to debate us and they want to debunk us because I think it's important that we all be cynics, Mike.
[00:50:12.656 --> 00:50:13.537]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:50:13.597 --> 00:50:17.161]  You know, it's good to refresh our memory on the hundreds and hundreds of points
[00:50:17.796 --> 00:50:20.098]  You have the most awesome bumper music.
[00:50:39.568 --> 00:50:43.931]  You know, when I can defend the Republic with Frank Flagg going, I'm in heaven.
[00:50:45.191 --> 00:50:49.294]  Another thing is, what's your take on the, there's not going to be a Super Bowl this year?
[00:50:50.375 --> 00:50:52.156]  No, I don't believe that for a second.
[00:50:52.176 --> 00:50:53.196]  You're welcome to stay aboard.
[00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:56.318]  We'll get the Ken, Kyle, everybody else patiently holding.
[00:50:56.358 --> 00:50:59.160]  It's the Alex Jones Show, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:51:01.346 --> 00:51:08.192]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.492 --> 00:51:09.874]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.054 --> 00:51:12.276]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.416 --> 00:51:14.498]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.778 --> 00:51:19.722]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.062 --> 00:51:24.086]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.326 --> 00:51:26.107]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.187 --> 00:51:36.834]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.974 --> 00:51:38.875]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.075 --> 00:51:42.958]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.

[00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:18.762]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:25.924]  The BerkeyLot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.344 --> 00:52:38.108]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:54:01.616 --> 00:54:07.183]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:11.640]  Yeah, it's pretty apparent.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.422]  You know, we get callers calling in.
[00:54:13.542 --> 00:54:15.224]  I love it when people call in and disagree.
[00:54:15.264 --> 00:54:26.054]  What I don't love is when I refute something that they've said and they move right on to the next issue as if they're going down a list trying to check things off.
[00:54:27.475 --> 00:54:29.858]  I think the argument actually works in our favor.
[00:54:30.758 --> 00:54:35.323]  And it's almost surprising to hear that people really still believe that the
[00:54:36.078 --> 00:54:41.202]  That the government story on 9-11 is 100% sound and accurate.
[00:54:41.622 --> 00:54:49.868]  Well, we've won over a lot of people over the last couple of years, so we'll hold out hope for Mark or anyone else listening to this broadcast that might doubt that again.
[00:54:49.888 --> 00:54:56.792]  I mean, inside job, just the way you say inside job, it certainly has kind of a weird ring to it.
[00:54:57.613 --> 00:55:01.356]  But certainly, I think the most important thing to really say when we're talking about 9-11
[00:55:02.871 --> 00:55:06.672]  Is to just really make the case that we've debunked the government's cover story.
[00:55:06.852 --> 00:55:07.632]  We have debunked it.
[00:55:07.712 --> 00:55:08.472]  It does not add up.
[00:55:08.512 --> 00:55:13.233]  Unless they want to publish a new cover story, we've shot this one full of holes.
[00:55:13.253 --> 00:55:21.515]  And then, of course, you add in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which was admittedly an FBI sting operation gone horribly wrong.
[00:55:22.375 --> 00:55:25.856]  Things really start making a lot of sense in that department.
[00:55:26.416 --> 00:55:28.716]  I wanted to carry over... Who do we have?
[00:55:28.976 --> 00:55:30.317]  Mike, I wanted to carry you over.
[00:55:30.337 --> 00:55:31.477]  You had one more question?
[00:55:32.077 --> 00:55:37.940]  Yeah, I was just concerned about what I heard earlier on the power hour about the Super Bowl.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.741]  You know, I'm not a big sports fan.
[00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:43.563]  In fact, yesterday was like driving around on Christmas Day for me.
[00:55:43.603 --> 00:55:45.104]  It was kind of nice.
[00:55:46.024 --> 00:55:47.185]  There will be a Super Bowl.
[00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:49.066]  There will be a Super Bowl.
[00:55:49.366 --> 00:55:54.349]  If Pittsburgh wins, I highly doubt it's going to be martial law and the government is moving to Pittsburgh.
[00:55:54.369 --> 00:55:55.529]  Is that the story you're talking about?
[00:55:55.729 --> 00:55:59.091]  Yeah, I'm just thinking 80,000 people vaporized would be a great place to...
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:06.625]  To boost Bush's ratings and declare martial law and get the ball really rolling in their favor.
[00:56:06.785 --> 00:56:14.012]  It would also backfire on Bush, who says he's protecting us now because of the NSA spying and the Super Bowl.
[00:56:14.032 --> 00:56:16.494]  This is when you want to get really worried, Mike.
[00:56:16.734 --> 00:56:22.960]  If that Patriot Act expires, if he has to come out and say, I have to stop using the NSA to spy on you.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.082]  By the way, I watched Enemy of the State the other day, folks.
[00:56:25.502 --> 00:56:26.063]  Great movie.
[00:56:27.156 --> 00:56:29.619]  Then we might get a little bit nervous.
[00:56:29.859 --> 00:56:32.704]  Because at that point, he's not allowed to protect us anymore.
[00:56:32.724 --> 00:56:35.548]  But right now, this falls in his lap.
[00:56:35.568 --> 00:56:38.011]  If anything happens, he will be blamed for it.
[00:56:38.251 --> 00:56:42.578]  But does not the Patriot Act expire on the 3rd and yet the Super Bowl is on the 5th?
[00:56:43.158 --> 00:56:44.319]  Uh, you could have a point there.
[00:56:45.659 --> 00:56:49.761]  Well, I mean, and you also have another point that, look, there are a lot of soft targets around.
[00:56:50.221 --> 00:56:51.202]  I'll tell you something funny.
[00:56:51.562 --> 00:56:59.505]  We were up in New York for the conventions, Alex and I and some others, the coronations, as we like to call them, the Republican National Coronation Ceremony.
[00:56:59.945 --> 00:57:05.528]  And with all of that police state security that you've seen in Martial Law, Rise of the Police State, the newest Alex Jones film,
[00:57:06.551 --> 00:57:12.841]  Uh, it would have been really easy for a terrorist to come in with a backpack and blow up countless people.
[00:57:12.861 --> 00:57:14.002]  It would have been very easy.
[00:57:14.363 --> 00:57:19.751]  And if that was a soft target, can you imagine what a soft target something like the Super Bowl might be?
[00:57:20.091 --> 00:57:21.734]  So it actually defies
[00:57:22.134 --> 00:57:23.054]  Imagination.
[00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:35.639]  How with our porous borders, how with so many soft targets and cells, supposedly, working inside the United States as we speak, how not one terrorist incident has happened in the last four years.
[00:57:35.879 --> 00:57:42.082]  It's not because the government is so competent, because we have to remember how incompetent they say they were before 9-11.
[00:57:42.302 --> 00:57:45.843]  It didn't magically happen on the 12th of September 2001.
[00:57:45.883 --> 00:57:46.683]  They became competent.
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.562]  So again, this just doesn't make sense.
[00:57:51.602 --> 00:58:03.854]  And this is something I often use when I'm talking to people who don't know about a lot of this information, Mike, is if there really were terrorists who were out to get us, they would have done something, of course, in the last four years.
[00:58:03.894 --> 00:58:11.401]  Now, of course, conveniently, Osama bin Laden just came out in his tape and made an excuse for why they haven't done anything for the last four years.
[00:58:13.222 --> 00:58:17.564]  I guess Osama Bin Laden is working with George W. Bush, but we've said that all along.
[00:58:18.084 --> 00:58:23.506]  But if something did happen, they could also go, oh well, we could have gone with the truth.
[00:58:23.727 --> 00:58:30.369]  I'm not in the prediction game, and I would probably put my money on the fact you're going to see the Super Bowl and the Seahawks are going to win.
[00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:31.410]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:35.591]  Second hour of Alex Jones Show coming up right after this and our special guest.
[00:58:35.791 --> 00:58:36.592]  More of your calls.
[00:58:36.852 --> 00:58:37.252]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:46.447]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.486 --> 00:58:58.127]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.807 --> 00:58:59.828]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.569 --> 00:59:01.670]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.331 --> 00:59:03.151]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.912 --> 00:59:04.813]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.473 --> 00:59:09.217]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.657 --> 00:59:13.781]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.183 --> 00:59:19.907]  Deep behind enemy lines, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.463]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones today, tomorrow, and Wednesday.
[00:59:24.563 --> 00:59:26.245]  Alex should be back on Thursday.
[00:59:26.265 --> 00:59:28.086]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:28.126 --> 00:59:32.350]  We have large stacks of news you are not getting anywhere else.
[00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:34.952]  All the news fit to suppress, as I like to say.
[00:59:35.412 --> 00:59:39.256]  Several guests on the Second Amendment coming up here in just a minute or two.
[00:59:40.453 --> 01:00:04.990]  And I wanted to spend at least a couple of minutes here in this segment cleaning up some of your calls, taking more of your calls, and then we're going to go for the next 50 minutes with two Second Amendment right activists, both Richard Pearson from the Illinois State Rifle Association and Aaron Zellman from Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, who, by the way, have a move to get rid of the BATF, which I think is admirable.
[01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:06.571]  Let's go back to the phones.
[01:00:06.671 --> 01:00:09.372]  Ken in New Jersey, thank you for patiently holding.
[01:00:09.412 --> 01:00:10.213]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.353 --> 01:00:11.774]  Hi, how are you?
[01:00:12.014 --> 01:00:12.475]  Very good.
[01:00:13.516 --> 01:00:16.298]  Okay, I have a couple questions and comments.
[01:00:17.479 --> 01:00:19.780]  My voice is not what it should be today, so bear with me.
[01:00:20.461 --> 01:00:28.267]  Okay, first of all, I just got a lot of his videos and I've been watching a few of them and I have a couple of comments to make.
[01:00:29.228 --> 01:00:31.749]  One thing was he said that fluoride is deadly.
[01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:34.191]  That's a minor question I have.
[01:00:34.311 --> 01:00:37.474]  I'd like to see some more information that backs that up because there's so much
[01:00:37.898 --> 01:00:41.039]  You know, mainstream, you know, information that would contradict that.
[01:00:41.559 --> 01:00:48.620]  And I don't, you know, dismiss what he's saying, but I'd like to be able to back it up so when I show other people I can confirm that.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:55.522]  Right, you have to be clear that there are two kinds of fluoride, and one is actually a byproduct of aluminum.
[01:00:55.562 --> 01:00:58.982]  That is the deadly neurotoxin and poison.
[01:00:59.002 --> 01:00:59.883]  Okay.
[01:01:00.003 --> 01:01:04.584]  And of course there is a famous quote from Hitler that says, if you want to dumb down the masses, give them fluoride.
[01:01:04.604 --> 01:01:05.424]  Shit.
[01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:06.404]  Alright.
[01:01:06.843 --> 01:01:18.907]  And the other one is a little bit bigger issue is that he claims that, as long as I didn't misunderstand him, that global warming is not real and that it's just a cycle of the Earth.
[01:01:19.348 --> 01:01:22.529]  Now, I do know that there are cycles in climate of the Earth, but
[01:01:23.444 --> 01:01:26.367]  You know, I'd need a lot of information also to back that up.
[01:01:26.687 --> 01:01:28.829]  Well, look, I mean, this is what you have to understand.
[01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:32.752]  Of course, none of us are scientists here, so we're laymen.
[01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.053]  We try to do the best we can.
[01:01:34.353 --> 01:01:46.384]  One thing we understand, though, is that the environmentalist industry is a multi-billion dollar industry run by some of the top globalists in the world, including Prince Philip and the Windsor family.
[01:01:47.084 --> 01:01:47.785]  I know about that.
[01:01:48.045 --> 01:01:49.525]  I'm familiar with that.
[01:01:49.545 --> 01:01:54.427]  So you have to take anything they say, and to put it lightly, with a grain of salt, though.
[01:01:54.768 --> 01:01:58.349]  I happened to fall into the camp with Alex Jones on this one.
[01:01:58.669 --> 01:02:08.654]  I think that global warming has been made up in order to, again, socialize and regulate industry to a point where, well, you know, some of the regulations are good, certainly.
[01:02:08.714 --> 01:02:09.834]  Some of them aren't good.
[01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:11.475]  When it handcuffs
[01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:20.759]  Right, well I don't doubt the conclusion that he makes with saying that it can be used in a negative way, but my question is does he think that
[01:02:35.475 --> 01:02:38.737]  That the pollution that we're spewing out doesn't have any effect on the climate.
[01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:39.538]  That's really my guess.
[01:02:39.558 --> 01:02:47.824]  Yeah, if you look at a volcano, for instance, it puts up more carbon monoxide, potentially, than a lot of the cars driving on the road today.
[01:02:48.124 --> 01:02:52.327]  And that's been going on now for, let's say, millions of years.
[01:02:53.108 --> 01:03:00.433]  Again, considering the source that a lot of the environmentalists and global warming information comes from, I'm extremely skeptical of it.
[01:03:00.854 --> 01:03:01.174]  That's all.
[01:03:02.051 --> 01:03:02.871]  Anything else?
[01:03:03.131 --> 01:03:08.052]  Another thing that I have to ask... Everybody's calling in, hitting me up on Alex Jones information.
[01:03:08.072 --> 01:03:09.772]  You sound like a bit of a debunker yourself.
[01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:11.333]  Or are you just curious?
[01:03:11.353 --> 01:03:13.933]  No, actually, most of what he says I pretty much agree with.
[01:03:14.033 --> 01:03:20.354]  So I don't want to give the wrong message, but I essentially agree with all the gist of everything he's saying, just those minor points.
[01:03:20.614 --> 01:03:22.235]  Go ahead, what's your final point here?
[01:03:22.255 --> 01:03:28.796]  The final thing is, on one of the other videos, he mentioned how the buildings fell faster than the speed of gravity.
[01:03:30.116 --> 01:03:32.178]  I'd like to question that first of all.
[01:03:32.378 --> 01:03:34.120]  As fast as the speed of gravity?
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.081]  Yeah.
[01:03:35.681 --> 01:03:38.544]  That's obviously not possible.
[01:03:38.764 --> 01:03:48.414]  Hey listen to tomorrow's show with Eric Hubschmidt because we're going to be talking about 9-11 extensively for about two hours tomorrow and that would be a great time to call in and re-ask that question.
[01:03:48.434 --> 01:03:52.217]  We're going to come right back with Richard Pearson from Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:03:52.237 --> 01:03:52.738]  Stay tuned!
[01:03:54.341 --> 01:03:57.183]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.443 --> 01:03:59.025]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.365 --> 01:04:04.048]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.389 --> 01:04:11.134]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.454 --> 01:04:13.416]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.636 --> 01:04:16.459]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.579 --> 01:04:21.223]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.443 --> 01:04:25.847]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.087 --> 01:04:33.314]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.554 --> 01:04:35.976]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:54.247 --> 01:06:00.613]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:06:00.833 --> 01:06:05.837]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:06:06.178 --> 01:06:14.085]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:14.225 --> 01:06:21.271]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:22.693]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:22.853 --> 01:06:26.238]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:26.298 --> 01:06:27.419]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.982]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:06:29.182 --> 01:06:36.011]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:42.719]  One more time that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:53.749 --> 01:06:55.931]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:59.375]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.978 --> 01:07:14.091]  We are going to move forward into some serious Second Amendment issues.
[01:07:15.362 --> 01:07:18.124]  Second Amendment is part of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:07:18.724 --> 01:07:21.707]  If you're not taking notes, you should know that.
[01:07:21.967 --> 01:07:23.228]  Richard Pearson is our guest.
[01:07:23.268 --> 01:07:27.491]  He's the Executive Director, Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:07:28.191 --> 01:07:34.896]  There's a lot of action in Illinois I want to talk about, and of course, so goes Illinois, so goes the rest of the country.
[01:07:35.356 --> 01:07:41.679]  We found that quite often, so it's important to kind of follow what is going on in the individual states with gun laws.
[01:07:41.939 --> 01:07:46.842]  Here in Texas, we had nine new pro-gun laws last year.
[01:07:47.322 --> 01:07:49.363]  Tells you why I like living in Texas.
[01:07:49.663 --> 01:07:52.104]  Richard Pearson, thank you for joining us on the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:07:52.525 --> 01:07:53.065]  My pleasure.
[01:07:53.505 --> 01:07:54.326]  Good to have you.
[01:07:54.806 --> 01:07:58.249]  The top issue is the F.O.I.D.
[01:07:58.409 --> 01:07:59.950]  fee and the F.O.I.D.
[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.811]  processing, the F.O.I.D.
[01:08:01.971 --> 01:08:02.552]  cards.
[01:08:02.932 --> 01:08:03.673]  Start us out.
[01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:06.255]  For people who don't know what that means, tell us what that is.
[01:08:06.735 --> 01:08:11.258]  Well, in 1968, Illinois passed the firearm owner's identification card.
[01:08:11.919 --> 01:08:18.504]  So if you're going to own, possess, or handle a firearm on a regular basis, well, you have to have a F.O.I.D.
[01:08:18.544 --> 01:08:18.704]  card.
[01:08:20.785 --> 01:08:29.228]  What's been happening is the state is mandated by the legislature, the state police, to handle the plate cards that they've been dragging their feet.
[01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:32.569]  And they have been up to 120 days late.
[01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:37.571]  But the law requires them to issue one or deny one or do something with it within 30 days.
[01:08:38.432 --> 01:08:50.016]  So we've introduced the law that if passed would fine the 500 the state police $100 a day for every day past 30 days, they don't issue the card.
[01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:56.513]  And they would have to pay damages to anybody who lost a hunting trip or anything else.
[01:08:57.288 --> 01:08:58.749]  If they didn't get the FOID card.
[01:08:58.789 --> 01:09:17.242]  What about, I guess people will still have their guns without their firearms owner's identification card, and if an intruder indeed broke into their house and they shot that person and they didn't have a FOID card because the police have been moving so slow, would they be, I guess, prosecuted for manslaughter or murder?
[01:09:17.563 --> 01:09:22.746]  Yeah, well, they would at least be prosecuted for not having a FOID card, which is rather severe.
[01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.716]  The rest would be up to what happened.
[01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.197]  What's behind this Richard?
[01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:33.259]  Why are the police moving so slow?
[01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:37.641]  I mean is this by design or is it just more incompetence and bureaucracy?
[01:09:37.662 --> 01:09:39.042]  Have you figured out what's behind this?
[01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:41.063]  Well I personally believe it's by design.
[01:09:42.704 --> 01:09:46.586]  They laid off over half of the staff that issues cards.
[01:09:47.427 --> 01:09:49.428]  And this always happens.
[01:09:49.548 --> 01:09:53.310]  Then they get behind and then the governor comes out and makes a big deal about
[01:09:54.177 --> 01:09:57.758]  Bringing in extra people to help the backlog when he created it in the first place.
[01:09:58.558 --> 01:10:03.399]  What about the constitutionality of even having to have a car to own a firearm?
[01:10:03.879 --> 01:10:11.441]  Well, under Illinois Constitution, we have a little section which says the Second Amendment subject to police powers.
[01:10:12.021 --> 01:10:20.683]  Now, no one exactly knows what that means yet, but that gives them and the state police an avenue to
[01:10:29.351 --> 01:10:40.297]  You know, Illinois, I guess, is moving into the direction of Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York, specifically with Chicago.
[01:10:40.317 --> 01:10:50.002]  Do you feel it's on the horizon, Richard, that it will be illegal to own a gun, that there will be massive gun confiscations in Illinois if you guys don't stay above board here?
[01:10:50.623 --> 01:11:02.438]  Well, I think that that is entirely possible, but I want to tell you that the NRA and the Illinois State Rifle Association actually did get three pro-gun laws passed last year.
[01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:06.082]  So it seems that the majority is more with you guys.
[01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:09.166]  At the moment, that is correct, but we have to keep it that way.
[01:11:11.075 --> 01:11:14.357]  Going back again to the FOID card.
[01:11:15.158 --> 01:11:16.659]  I want to take people through the process.
[01:11:16.699 --> 01:11:17.659]  You want to have a gun.
[01:11:17.679 --> 01:11:21.221]  You're going to have to have a firearms owner identification card.
[01:11:21.261 --> 01:11:24.143]  Of course, there's many charges for this.
[01:11:24.163 --> 01:11:30.207]  The gun lobbyists are now fuming because the state police have been so slow at processing these FOID applications.
[01:11:30.527 --> 01:11:37.531]  Give us a sense of how long it would take you to legally have and use a firearm in Chicago or in Illinois.
[01:11:37.811 --> 01:11:41.133]  Well, in Illinois, it would take somewhere between 8 and 12 weeks right now.
[01:11:41.754 --> 01:11:42.575]  You would have to apply.
[01:11:42.595 --> 01:11:43.635]  You have an application.
[01:11:44.296 --> 01:11:51.581]  Then the state police run a background check, similar to a NICS check for all those in other states.
[01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:55.384]  And if you pass that, then you would be issued the card.
[01:11:56.084 --> 01:12:01.148]  When you purchase a firearm, then a recheck is done on that.
[01:12:01.854 --> 01:12:02.855]  Thank you.
[01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:11.423]  We've controlled the price on it.
[01:12:11.443 --> 01:12:14.545]  They're only allowed to charge three bucks for a Knicks check in Illinois.
[01:12:14.565 --> 01:12:15.606]  Two dollars.
[01:12:15.927 --> 01:12:23.794]  What does the other side say, Richard, that they need this time in order to make sure that terrorists aren't getting guns or criminals aren't getting guns?
[01:12:23.814 --> 01:12:24.955]  I mean, what is their excuse here?
[01:12:25.556 --> 01:12:26.256]  They don't have one.
[01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:32.182]  They haven't even bothered to give you a lame excuse just to make something up.
[01:12:32.642 --> 01:12:33.063]  That's right.
[01:12:33.624 --> 01:12:41.189]  You've also got Governor Blagojevich, not an easy name to pronounce.
[01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:47.134]  He announced in this election year that he wanted to end competitive shooting and gun collecting in Illinois.
[01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:48.154]  I mean, that's outrageous!
[01:12:48.395 --> 01:12:53.658]  Well, that's essentially what House Bill 2414 would do if it passed in Illinois.
[01:12:54.359 --> 01:12:58.522]  And it became part of his State of the State message, but it was not really well received.
[01:12:59.663 --> 01:13:03.844]  And we should also mention that Mayor Richard Daley is in on this as well.
[01:13:04.164 --> 01:13:05.244]  Oh yes, absolutely.
[01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:09.765]  He is probably the primary pusher of anti-government stuff in Illinois.
[01:13:10.685 --> 01:13:16.506]  You know, if they tried to do this here in Texas, I think there'd be a mob surrounding the Statehouse in an hour.
[01:13:16.866 --> 01:13:21.487]  How is that that they can announce this and still have any political support whatsoever?
[01:13:21.987 --> 01:13:24.248]  Well, they always announce it in the city of Chicago.
[01:13:26.127 --> 01:13:28.189]  This is like any other big city.
[01:13:28.929 --> 01:13:29.770]  Eastern big city.
[01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:35.514]  The Chicago Machine controls everyone and everyone who is a member.
[01:13:37.201 --> 01:13:44.245]  And this gun ban, or this gun regulation, again, to end competitive shooting and gun collecting, how do they plan to pull that off?
[01:13:44.285 --> 01:13:45.966]  Have you dissected the legislation?
[01:13:46.407 --> 01:13:54.451]  Well, there's complication involved in it, and so they could do that, they could run back and check your records and see the problem.
[01:13:54.591 --> 01:13:57.013]  With a 40-card, they know who all the gun owners are.
[01:13:57.173 --> 01:13:57.573]  That's right.
[01:13:58.914 --> 01:14:01.495]  So they've got a database of all the gun owners.
[01:14:02.075 --> 01:14:08.358]  If your FOID card, I guess, elapses, do they come knock on your door, Richard, and say, we'd like to have your gun?
[01:14:08.378 --> 01:14:10.439]  You have not applied for your recent FOID card?
[01:14:11.259 --> 01:14:12.540]  That has actually happened, yes.
[01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:16.462]  It happens particularly in the city of Chicago.
[01:14:17.296 --> 01:14:18.977]  Yeah.
[01:14:19.097 --> 01:14:20.478]  Here's the amazing thing.
[01:14:20.518 --> 01:14:29.242]  Again, we're with Richard Pearson, Executive Director, Illinois State Rifle Association, and their website is www.isra.org.
[01:14:29.282 --> 01:14:33.064]  If you live in Illinois, you really need to get on board with these guys.
[01:14:33.084 --> 01:14:37.025]  If you don't live in Illinois, you might want to take a look at what they're doing because it's setting a number of precedents.
[01:14:38.366 --> 01:14:44.511]  I guess ironic, Richard, is that criminals don't use FOID cards when they rob banks and shoot people.
[01:14:44.531 --> 01:14:46.032]  They don't apply for FOID cards.
[01:14:46.252 --> 01:14:48.774]  They get black market guns off the street.
[01:14:48.814 --> 01:14:49.454]  They use them.
[01:14:49.874 --> 01:14:55.499]  But if I want to collect a gun or hunt or protect my family, I'm going to be taken through the ringer by the government.
[01:14:56.039 --> 01:14:56.860]  Well, that's correct.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:07.067]  One of the things that they forget to mention, too, is that there are 1,200 firearms out of the Chicago Police evidence locker that have disappeared but are suddenly reappearing on the street again.
[01:15:07.611 --> 01:15:08.993]  They have a hard time explaining that.
[01:15:10.334 --> 01:15:11.396]  You want to take a stab at it?
[01:15:12.117 --> 01:15:14.419]  Well, gee, who would have access?
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.863]  And certainly no police would tell those things, would they?
[01:15:17.603 --> 01:15:20.307]  No, because all police are above board.
[01:15:20.387 --> 01:15:22.810]  None of them have ever been found to be corrupt.
[01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:27.234]  And we should just trust the police and their administrators and the bureaucrats.
[01:15:27.254 --> 01:15:27.995]  We should just trust them.
[01:15:28.415 --> 01:15:28.916]  Exactly.
[01:15:28.936 --> 01:15:30.717]  Because they've done so good for us in the past.
[01:15:31.238 --> 01:15:31.478]  Yes.
[01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:39.604]  You know what's funny also here, I guess not really funny as much as it speaks very loudly to the times we live in, we have a
[01:15:40.545 --> 01:15:43.027]  Well, I think that there are some people who are conservative.
[01:16:01.275 --> 01:16:11.761]  In the Republican Party anyway, and in the Democratic Party too, but there's also a liberal wing of each party and they're trying to gain control of the efforts in each party.
[01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:12.221]  Yeah.
[01:16:12.661 --> 01:16:24.788]  You know, when I was at the conventions in New York and I heard the Arnold Schwarzenegger, Das Gruppenführer speech about what it meant to be a Republican, those are great words, it's just too bad he doesn't follow up on that.
[01:16:24.808 --> 01:16:29.751]  I mean, in his city of San Francisco, they have banned the outright ownership of firearms, period!
[01:16:30.451 --> 01:16:31.171]  Well, that's correct.
[01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:33.472]  But, you know, words are one thing, deeds are another.
[01:16:33.612 --> 01:16:34.593]  That's exactly right.
[01:16:35.153 --> 01:16:42.495]  And then, of course, we get to the issue of .50 caliber weapons and ammunition, something that everybody seems to agree we should ban.
[01:16:42.855 --> 01:16:48.417]  Though, I guess if Al-Qaeda is going to be charging our shores, I mean, wouldn't it be handy to have a .50 cal?
[01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:49.678]  Well, that's true.
[01:16:49.718 --> 01:16:56.380]  But, you know, when you present these people with the statistics on the .50 caliber, BMG is primarily what they're talking about.
[01:16:57.589 --> 01:17:03.914]  In Illinois the net has gone so wide that it would have banned rifle slugs for deer hunting and so forth and so on.
[01:17:04.775 --> 01:17:08.778]  You find that those firearms have seldom been used in a crime.
[01:17:08.798 --> 01:17:10.899]  I actually know of only one.
[01:17:10.919 --> 01:17:12.841]  It was in Colorado and a policeman did it.
[01:17:13.982 --> 01:17:16.323]  Let's not let the facts get in the way here though, Richard.
[01:17:16.363 --> 01:17:16.903]  No, no, no.
[01:17:17.623 --> 01:17:20.204]  Back to our stumbling block of what we want to accomplish, right?
[01:17:20.644 --> 01:17:25.146]  What are you guys trying to do with Blago, and what are you trying to do with these FOI cards?
[01:17:25.366 --> 01:17:26.706]  What is your plan of action?
[01:17:27.086 --> 01:17:32.948]  Well, there is a bill being presented that will just simply do away with the FOI card.
[01:17:33.789 --> 01:17:39.991]  But more importantly is we are working very hard to get a new governor in Illinois, and
[01:17:41.617 --> 01:17:45.238]  If we get that accomplished, things will be alright, at least for a while.
[01:17:45.658 --> 01:17:54.260]  I mean, you would think that if this was used correctly in a political fashion, in a public relations fashion, that this would be the end for Blago?
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.380]  Well, there's a lot of reasons that he might come to an end.
[01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:02.841]  Of course, we have to ask ourselves, how did Richard Daly stay in business all this long?
[01:18:02.861 --> 01:18:10.143]  Well, last I heard, there were 28 federal investigators in the Chicago City Hall investigating
[01:18:11.224 --> 01:18:12.825]  Can you believe corruption in the city?
[01:18:12.845 --> 01:18:15.307]  It's hard to believe that they would have that.
[01:18:15.347 --> 01:18:16.889]  No, corruption in Chicago?
[01:18:17.309 --> 01:18:19.170]  That's the first I've heard of that, Richard.
[01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:21.412]  It's the first I've heard of it, too.
[01:18:21.552 --> 01:18:33.702]  Obviously, if this gets out, I don't know if you're getting on the local talk radio stations, if you're really getting to appeal, especially to the more rural and conservative people of Illinois, that this is a major problem.
[01:18:34.964 --> 01:18:36.567]  Let me ask you that when we come back.
[01:18:36.607 --> 01:18:41.235]  We've got another 10 minutes with Richard Pearson, Executive Director, Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:18:41.415 --> 01:18:43.299]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:43.359 --> 01:18:46.905]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones, GCN Radio Network.
[01:18:46.925 --> 01:18:47.306]  Stay tuned.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:56.602]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:18:56.662 --> 01:19:00.865]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:19:01.105 --> 01:19:03.886]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:19:04.067 --> 01:19:06.468]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:19:06.668 --> 01:19:15.313]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:19:15.514 --> 01:19:16.854]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:19:17.054 --> 01:19:21.237]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:19:21.517 --> 01:19:22.058]  We're good to go!
[01:19:40.452 --> 01:19:42.053]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:42.073 --> 01:19:46.096]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:19:46.136 --> 01:19:47.998]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:20:07.879 --> 01:20:14.141]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:20:15.022 --> 01:20:23.125]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:20:24.145 --> 01:20:31.988]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:20:36.463 --> 01:20:36.843]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6.

[01:20:37.904 --> 01:20:38.984]  Call now.
[01:20:39.004 --> 01:20:41.385]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:20:41.445 --> 01:20:44.166]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:44.186 --> 01:20:45.166]  One and the same.
[01:21:02.975 --> 01:21:12.817]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:13.237 --> 01:21:16.398]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.459]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:18.519 --> 01:21:21.979]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:24.300]  Here is reality.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.261]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:32.362]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:32.955 --> 01:21:36.716]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:21:42.678 --> 01:21:44.019]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:21:44.059 --> 01:21:46.540]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:08.521]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:08.741 --> 01:22:12.787]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMedInc's patented methodology.

[01:22:43.175 --> 01:22:44.936]  Or, call LaysMed at 702-953-0267 today.
[01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:14.143]  Richard Harrison, again, Executive Director, Illinois State Rifle Association, taking on both Mayor Daley and Governor Blago, as they call him.
[01:23:14.503 --> 01:23:19.784]  That doesn't sound a bit draconian in itself, a guy named Blago, nicknamed Blago.
[01:23:20.484 --> 01:23:31.586]  That just sounds a little funny to me, but they're taking on their local and city governments in order to ban these FOID cards, again, Firearms Owners Protection or Identification Cards, sorry,
[01:23:32.226 --> 01:23:37.973]  And to, of course, legalize the firearms that you own for hunting and for collecting.
[01:23:38.273 --> 01:23:39.654]  It appears that is something.
[01:23:39.694 --> 01:23:45.040]  That is a right that has to be protected, thanks to the good people at the Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.323]  That is being done in Illinois.
[01:23:47.343 --> 01:23:48.324]  They're fighting rather hard.
[01:23:48.364 --> 01:23:51.307]  I'm going to take a few calls on this subject before we get done with Richard.
[01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:54.948]  And the last segment, Richard, I asked you if you're getting local press.
[01:23:55.108 --> 01:24:01.990]  I found in some instances that it's very difficult for NRA or local gun advocates to get local press.
[01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:04.551]  Of course, we're supposed to have a liberal media.
[01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:05.631]  I guess maybe that explains it.
[01:24:05.671 --> 01:24:09.992]  Sometimes they don't even take your money to run ads on local radio stations.
[01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:11.993]  Have you had any problems in that direction?
[01:24:12.693 --> 01:24:13.713]  Well, yes, we have.
[01:24:13.773 --> 01:24:15.413]  But the word is getting out.
[01:24:15.654 --> 01:24:18.734]  And we're doing a lot of radio interviews and that sort of thing.
[01:24:18.834 --> 01:24:20.855]  And of course, the Internet's been a great help.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:27.302]  It's actually starting to erode, I think, the liberal newspapers because people are turning to other news sources.
[01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:43.907]  Did you hear, this recently just happened, maybe about four or five months ago, I read this in the mainstream news, Mike Wallace from 60 Minutes, who is Chris Wallace's dad at Fox News, we all remember Mike Wallace, he has actually been banned by CBS to even discuss
[01:24:44.367 --> 01:24:50.309]  Or cover any stories related to firearms, because he has been found not to be an honest broker.
[01:24:50.369 --> 01:25:02.253]  He is a backer of the Brady Bill, he makes speeches at these Brady Bill conferences, and he's obviously biased, so they have taken his right away to even discuss firearms on 60 Minutes or on CBS.
[01:25:03.113 --> 01:25:05.654]  That's true, although I believe his son Chris is somewhat different.
[01:25:06.736 --> 01:25:07.857]  No, and I've met Chris.
[01:25:07.897 --> 01:25:09.057]  It's funny, you know.
[01:25:09.497 --> 01:25:13.979]  They always say that your children are the opposite of you, and at least on face value.
[01:25:13.999 --> 01:25:16.320]  Now, Chris looks like a staunch conservative.
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.642]  His dad is a very open liberal, though.
[01:25:18.902 --> 01:25:21.243]  That could all be an illusion, you understand, Richard.
[01:25:21.303 --> 01:25:24.664]  They could be playing WWF with us, of course.
[01:25:24.884 --> 01:25:29.326]  Let's talk to Troy in Florida, who I believe had a question for Richard Pearson, our guest.
[01:25:29.547 --> 01:25:30.587]  Troy, thank you for calling in.
[01:25:30.607 --> 01:25:31.147]  You're on the air.
[01:25:31.347 --> 01:25:31.728]  Hey, Jack.
[01:25:31.768 --> 01:25:32.408]  How are you today?
[01:25:32.468 --> 01:25:33.168]  How are you, Richard?
[01:25:33.508 --> 01:25:33.829]  I'm fine.
[01:25:34.169 --> 01:25:34.769]  How are you?
[01:25:35.356 --> 01:25:54.259]  This card, I don't own a firearm, but after what happened in New Orleans this past year with the Katrina fiasco, I live here down in Florida and I have every intention of getting a firearm because if you look and see what happened down there, they did not protect the people whatsoever.
[01:25:54.479 --> 01:25:54.759]  That's right.
[01:25:54.779 --> 01:25:59.100]  They sent the military in, kept the water from the people, all this stuff.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:04.561]  My question is on this card, I don't know much about the card, but isn't this just a way
[01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:06.694]  That's exactly it, isn't it, Richard?
[01:26:29.474 --> 01:26:32.736]  But I think it's only Illinois, Massachusetts and Cuba that has that.
[01:26:33.737 --> 01:26:34.497]  Cuba, of course.
[01:26:34.877 --> 01:26:38.119]  Troy makes a good point using Katrina as a reference.
[01:26:38.179 --> 01:26:51.187]  When the proverbial poop hits the fan, Richard, you're going to need that firearm to protect your water and your food and your family when there are roving gangs of criminals in a lawless society like that.
[01:26:52.688 --> 01:26:56.631]  If the government had their way, and if Illinois had their way, we wouldn't be able to protect ourselves.
[01:26:56.671 --> 01:27:00.453]  We'd be marching to the Superdome and waiting for the government to protect us.
[01:27:00.493 --> 01:27:02.314]  Of course, that is not their initiative at all.
[01:27:02.374 --> 01:27:05.376]  It is not even part of their job, so to speak, to protect us.
[01:27:05.876 --> 01:27:06.397]  Well, no.
[01:27:06.737 --> 01:27:12.280]  Actually, most laws require the citizens to protect the government, not the other way around.
[01:27:13.301 --> 01:27:14.141]  Thanks for the call, Troy.
[01:27:14.221 --> 01:27:16.963]  Jason in Maryland also had a question for Richard Pearson.
[01:27:16.983 --> 01:27:18.344]  Jason, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:19.304 --> 01:27:21.546]  Hi guys, I live in Maryland now.
[01:27:21.646 --> 01:27:27.511]  I'm from Illinois and I have a lot of family there, most of whom own firearms.
[01:27:28.752 --> 01:27:35.677]  My uncle is actually one of the better shooters for the Winchester Sportsman Shooting Rifle Association.
[01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:42.803]  I was wondering if you had made contact with, I think you might get a lot of backers.
[01:27:43.984 --> 01:27:47.687]  In Southern Illinois there's a company, an affiliate of Winchester called Olin.
[01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:52.271]  And I was wondering if you were familiar with that, and if you had maybe tapped that resource?
[01:27:53.272 --> 01:27:56.334]  We're very familiar with O1DF, and I have talked to those people.
[01:27:56.934 --> 01:27:57.775]  Are they working with you?
[01:27:57.815 --> 01:27:58.956]  Are they helping you guys out at all?
[01:27:59.256 --> 01:28:00.817]  Oh, sure.
[01:28:00.937 --> 01:28:02.979]  We have a lot of listeners, of course, in Illinois.
[01:28:03.019 --> 01:28:04.080]  What would you like them to do?
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.461]  Again, let's give out your website.
[01:28:05.581 --> 01:28:09.203]  It is www.isra.org.
[01:28:09.424 --> 01:28:13.867]  Isra.org, or you can simply Google Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:28:14.879 --> 01:28:18.141]  Uh, look, if you're in Illinois, please help these people out.
[01:28:18.181 --> 01:28:21.202]  They're trying to help you, and it's very admirable, Richard.
[01:28:21.242 --> 01:28:23.163]  I know it's not easy, but you keep the faith.
[01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:24.044]  Alright, thank you.
[01:28:24.064 --> 01:28:25.184]  Thanks for being on the program today.
[01:28:25.204 --> 01:28:26.005]  We're going to come right back.
[01:28:26.045 --> 01:28:30.067]  Stay on this subject with Aaron Zellman, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[01:28:30.087 --> 01:28:31.007]  We'll go back to your calls.
[01:28:31.308 --> 01:28:32.668]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:32.788 --> 01:28:33.709]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:33.729 --> 01:28:34.069]  Stay tuned.
[01:28:43.453 --> 01:28:46.458]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.379 --> 01:28:50.063]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.812 --> 01:29:00.698]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:00.838 --> 01:29:13.768]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.730]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:19.374]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:23.438]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:23.699 --> 01:29:28.664]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:28.944 --> 01:29:30.646]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:34.871]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:29:35.131 --> 01:29:36.992]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[01:29:37.132 --> 01:29:41.715]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.

[01:29:43.556 --> 01:29:44.096]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[01:29:54.093 --> 01:29:59.058]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[01:30:04.845 --> 01:30:09.149]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:30:09.490 --> 01:30:12.493]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:12.813 --> 01:30:16.257]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:25.924]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:26.185 --> 01:30:29.687]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:29.927 --> 01:30:37.013]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:30:53.359 --> 01:30:54.461]  You don't love me anymore?
[01:30:54.781 --> 01:30:56.604]  You used to take such good care of me.
[01:30:56.624 --> 01:30:58.106]  Is that my car talking to me?
[01:30:58.247 --> 01:30:58.527]  Yes.
[01:30:58.828 --> 01:30:59.689]  You neglect me.
[01:30:59.849 --> 01:31:01.832]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[01:31:03.655 --> 01:31:04.677]  Use the cheapest gas.
[01:31:05.017 --> 01:31:05.879]  I'm getting sick.
[01:31:06.219 --> 01:31:08.383]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[01:31:09.423 --> 01:31:09.904]  Wait a minute.
[01:31:09.984 --> 01:31:11.624]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[01:31:11.845 --> 01:31:20.409]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[01:31:20.869 --> 01:31:26.332]  Protected unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[01:31:26.572 --> 01:31:28.953]  Okay, I'll add some protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[01:31:29.113 --> 01:31:33.776]  How about faster acceleration, more horsepower, longer lasting.
[01:31:33.996 --> 01:31:35.657]  I'll always be there for you.
[01:31:35.837 --> 01:31:39.158]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.
[01:31:39.339 --> 01:31:43.681]  For a special offer of free shipping, go to www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:31:43.781 --> 01:31:45.102]  That's www.sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:32:16.738 --> 01:32:18.480]  We are not going to back down.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.822]  That is becoming more and more apparent.
[01:32:21.883 --> 01:32:26.186]  I gotta tell you, you know, I'm a radio talk show host, but I'm also an activist.
[01:32:27.067 --> 01:32:30.269]  And the two are not supposed to go together if we just talked about Mike Walsh.
[01:32:30.289 --> 01:32:31.911]  He's an activist for gun control.
[01:32:32.872 --> 01:32:35.294]  I happen to be an activist for the Second Amendment.
[01:32:35.314 --> 01:32:38.476]  I happen to be an activist for the Constitution.
[01:32:38.556 --> 01:32:40.338]  And I gotta tell you folks, it is fun.
[01:32:40.438 --> 01:32:42.940]  It's fun to get out there and change things.
[01:32:43.653 --> 01:32:51.179]  It's not so fun to sit on your couch and worry and stress out because the world is going to hell in a handbasket with a racing stripe on it.
[01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:56.123]  So I really encourage you to support the guests we're having on the program today.
[01:32:56.403 --> 01:32:59.846]  There is nothing more important than the Second Amendment.
[01:32:59.886 --> 01:33:06.711]  Of course, the Second Amendment gives you the ability to hang on to the rest of your rights, your constitutional rights.
[01:33:06.731 --> 01:33:08.653]  Without that, of course as we know,
[01:33:09.474 --> 01:33:11.898]  Uh, tyrants loved unarmed peasants.
[01:33:12.038 --> 01:33:14.221]  On that note, I want to bring in Aaron Zellman.
[01:33:14.562 --> 01:33:18.488]  He is the Director of Jews for the Preservations of Firearm Ownership.
[01:33:18.528 --> 01:33:21.873]  Right now, there is a special at Infowars.com.
[01:33:21.893 --> 01:33:22.615]  You can get the
[01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:35.647]  video by Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership that is called Innocence Betrayed and an Infowars t-shirt together $44.95 for both the video and the t-shirt.
[01:33:36.268 --> 01:33:40.871]  I have the particular t-shirt Mass Murders Agree Gun Control Works.
[01:33:40.951 --> 01:33:43.673]  I'm wearing it right now appropriately enough.
[01:33:43.873 --> 01:33:45.394]  Let's bring up Aaron Zellman.
[01:33:45.534 --> 01:33:47.015]  Aaron, thank you for joining us on the program.
[01:33:47.035 --> 01:33:50.858]  You know, I've wanted to have you on my show for a long time, so this is a privilege for me to have you on today.
[01:33:51.118 --> 01:33:52.119]  Well, my pleasure, Jack.
[01:33:52.239 --> 01:33:53.220]  I'm glad to be with you.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.381]  Good to have you.
[01:33:54.461 --> 01:33:58.665]  Well, we just talked to Richard Pearson with the Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:33:58.705 --> 01:34:04.131]  He was telling us about the FOID cards and how, of course, the government is keeping track of all of our guns.
[01:34:04.151 --> 01:34:12.419]  A number of listeners made some extremely intelligent points that they're keeping track of all this so they know where to go, whose door to knock on when they want these guns back.
[01:34:14.275 --> 01:34:15.996]  Well, there's nothing new about that.
[01:34:16.316 --> 01:34:18.377]  I mean, we did a whole video on that.
[01:34:19.898 --> 01:34:23.059]  Going back over 100 years of governments doing that.
[01:34:23.079 --> 01:34:31.203]  You know, they all go to the same, I jokingly say, but they all go to the same school to learn how to be a dictator.
[01:34:32.148 --> 01:34:33.789]  Because it's the same program.
[01:34:34.089 --> 01:34:36.210]  It's the same procedure.
[01:34:36.531 --> 01:34:39.512]  You can teach whatever dictatorship they want to know where the guns are.
[01:34:39.732 --> 01:34:42.294]  And you say a playbook that's been used for hundreds of years now?
[01:34:42.574 --> 01:34:42.794]  Sure.
[01:34:43.314 --> 01:34:47.577]  Whether it's gun control or sword control or crossbow control, it's the same thing.
[01:34:47.737 --> 01:34:49.459]  What situation are we in now?
[01:34:49.539 --> 01:34:53.542]  How well have we done here in this 21st century, the new millennium?
[01:34:53.602 --> 01:34:55.684]  Where do we stand on gun control?
[01:34:56.445 --> 01:35:04.612]  Of course, the point has to be made that we have a conservative government, at least in theory, a Republican-controlled government, yet the gun-grabbing continues.
[01:35:06.092 --> 01:35:07.453]  Well, I would debate the point.
[01:35:07.733 --> 01:35:09.875]  I don't think we have a conservative government at all.
[01:35:09.935 --> 01:35:12.997]  I think we, uh... The operative word there, Aaron, was in theory.
[01:35:13.237 --> 01:35:14.338]  In theory, okay.
[01:35:14.358 --> 01:35:14.958]  Jack, go ahead.
[01:35:15.058 --> 01:35:20.802]  I mean, to me, we've come to the point of there's darn little difference between the two.
[01:35:21.743 --> 01:35:30.109]  Now, the rhetoric is different, but the laws, or the lack of abolishing bad laws, nothing really has changed.
[01:35:30.769 --> 01:35:32.110]  And I think, where are we at right now?
[01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:34.432]  I think we're at a very dangerous point, because
[01:35:36.308 --> 01:35:39.151]  The government has achieved something it's wanted to do for a long time.
[01:35:39.991 --> 01:35:45.996]  Make the populace not willing to fight, to be apathetic.
[01:35:47.117 --> 01:35:48.278]  And I think that's very dangerous.
[01:35:48.318 --> 01:35:49.599]  I think that's where we're at right now.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:58.286]  And I think that they're so arrogant, they feel like they've already won.
[01:35:58.306 --> 01:36:05.252]  I mean, it's really quite a conundrum when they tell us that there's a terrorist behind every bush, yet they don't want us to have firearms.
[01:36:06.778 --> 01:36:08.139]  Well it does make you wonder.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:16.482]  Either they are not logical or they are very evil in their intent.
[01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:23.084]  So overall if you had to I mean it's difficult because of course this is a state issue would you agree with that Aaron?
[01:36:23.564 --> 01:36:27.906]  I mean it's a constitutional issue but it seems to be handled differently state by state.
[01:36:27.926 --> 01:36:30.747]  Of course here in Texas so I think we're doing quite well
[01:36:31.227 --> 01:36:37.851]  Though if you look at California, New York, Washington, D.C., and now Chicago and a few others, they're not doing very well.
[01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:44.235]  How would you rate the country overall on being able to, again, hold on to our Second Amendment here?
[01:36:45.236 --> 01:36:47.717]  Well, first of all, we have a different position.
[01:36:47.877 --> 01:36:53.420]  We don't think that the Second Amendment is really a constitutional issue or a guaranteed right.
[01:36:54.581 --> 01:36:55.021]  Why is that?
[01:36:55.162 --> 01:36:59.104]  Well, I think that the perspective we take is that
[01:36:59.781 --> 01:37:03.083]  You don't want to have a contractual right to be able to defend your life.
[01:37:03.643 --> 01:37:05.004]  So, in other words, it's a God-given right?
[01:37:05.044 --> 01:37:05.944]  It's a God-given right.
[01:37:05.964 --> 01:37:09.466]  You were born with the right to be able to kill those who are coming to kill you.
[01:37:09.486 --> 01:37:14.308]  That makes way too much sense, actually, Aaron.
[01:37:14.549 --> 01:37:19.211]  So, I think that people who claim they have a constitutional right are really shortchanging themselves.
[01:37:20.312 --> 01:37:28.896]  Well, and you make a good point, because those that would have us sign on to gun control used the Second Amendment against us in the fact that
[01:37:29.868 --> 01:37:37.290]  You know, a well-regulated militia being necessary to secure a free state and the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:50.373]  I believe the excuse they're using, Aaron, is that we have a National Guard now, the state can protect you, they are a well-regulated or they are a militia, so to speak, and that somehow supersedes the people's rights to keep and bear arms.
[01:37:51.453 --> 01:37:52.834]  Well, therein lies the fraud.
[01:37:54.475 --> 01:38:04.341]  That's why I think it's important for people to take the position that they have a natural right, a God-given right to defend their life, whether there's a Second Amendment or not, whether there's a Constitution or not.
[01:38:05.382 --> 01:38:12.846]  I think that's the argument people have to take forward, at least people who are serious about keeping themselves armed and staying alive.
[01:38:13.467 --> 01:38:20.811]  Those who don't wish to take that argument forward, they're waving a white flag and are saying, well, we really don't care anymore.
[01:38:21.418 --> 01:38:23.820]  What ended up happening in San Francisco?
[01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:30.765]  Last I checked, Aaron, there were measures being taken for an all-out firearms ban in San Francisco.
[01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:33.567]  What exactly is the state of affairs there now?
[01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:34.667]  How has that rolled through?
[01:38:34.687 --> 01:38:42.933]  Well, as best as I understand it, they're banning the ownership of handguns, for sure.
[01:38:44.154 --> 01:38:46.156]  You have to keep them outside the city limits.
[01:38:47.316 --> 01:38:49.458]  I haven't followed it very closely, only because
[01:38:50.886 --> 01:38:53.928]  You know, JPFO does not get involved in legislative issues.
[01:38:55.809 --> 01:39:07.495]  We have spent an awful lot of time and effort in all states trying to give people the essential knowledge they need to stand up to the arrogance of the bureaucracy.
[01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:15.319]  But I think that it's... It wouldn't surprise me if they've already said, well, you can't have guns at all in the city of San Francisco.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:20.162]  But I think that just shows how fearful they are of an armed citizenry.
[01:39:21.259 --> 01:39:24.623]  You don't make an issue out of someone having a gun unless you fear them.
[01:39:25.765 --> 01:39:29.309]  And I think that the chickens are coming home to roost.
[01:39:29.429 --> 01:39:35.977]  The government in all states, all cities, the federal government, has spent more than it has coming in.
[01:39:36.678 --> 01:39:38.560]  And the house of cards is about to collapse.
[01:39:39.423 --> 01:39:42.604]  So naturally, you would want the peasants to be disarmed.
[01:39:42.784 --> 01:39:44.765]  Well, sure, and we understand that.
[01:39:44.825 --> 01:40:02.570]  Though, of course, there's a lot of... I guess, should I call it... I hate to fall into this trap with you, Aaron, but should I call it liberal disinformation that tells us that guns kill, people don't, and if we take the guns off the street, we'll have less gun violence, even though every fact has shown that to be exactly wrong?
[01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:06.484]  Well, you know... And are the criminals handing over their guns?
[01:40:06.544 --> 01:40:07.725]  I guess that's the big question.
[01:40:07.965 --> 01:40:10.165]  You know, I'm going to answer you a different way than you might expect.
[01:40:10.485 --> 01:40:10.745]  Alright.
[01:40:11.465 --> 01:40:12.145]  Words kill.
[01:40:13.506 --> 01:40:21.207]  It is words used by dictators that make other people want to kill people.
[01:40:22.947 --> 01:40:25.508]  So, guns or no guns, it really is words.
[01:40:26.288 --> 01:40:30.989]  And the people who use the words most often are people who are left of center,
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:39.823]  Who are full of hate and arrogance, and they are the ones who are the most dangerous.
[01:40:40.243 --> 01:40:46.126]  It is their words, which is all the more reason for people to be armed.
[01:40:46.266 --> 01:40:47.326]  That makes a lot of sense.
[01:40:47.546 --> 01:40:51.588]  Talk to me about reasonable victim disarmament.
[01:40:51.608 --> 01:40:53.469]  There was a case in San Francisco, a woman
[01:40:54.796 --> 01:40:58.098]  I believe was trying to protect herself in her home.
[01:40:58.638 --> 01:41:00.259]  Are you familiar with the story?
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.100]  It's on your website.
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:04.022]  In fact, we did a story about it.
[01:41:04.062 --> 01:41:05.243]  We sent it out to people.
[01:41:07.204 --> 01:41:11.967]  To the good example of where a woman was, in fact, she could depend upon the police to protect her.
[01:41:11.987 --> 01:41:16.229]  She had an unlawful concealed firearm, apparently.
[01:41:16.690 --> 01:41:16.930]  Right.
[01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:21.993]  And the person who wrote the article sort of had it right until she got to the point
[01:41:22.597 --> 01:41:25.739]  Talking about where guns do have to be controlled.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.121]  And at which at that point, she lost her credibility.
[01:41:29.942 --> 01:41:31.883]  Or maybe she's still credible, but she just doesn't know.
[01:41:32.223 --> 01:41:34.745]  She has no idea what what she is talking about.
[01:41:35.806 --> 01:41:37.246]  But the example is another.
[01:41:38.027 --> 01:41:39.108]  Well, it's a great example.
[01:41:39.188 --> 01:41:50.235]  And we show it in a book we have called Dial 911 and Die, where we've taken every state in the union, and given people the essential case law and state law, showing them
[01:41:50.882 --> 01:41:51.142]  I don't know.
[01:42:15.751 --> 01:42:25.077]  That it comes from the book, Dial 911 and Die, and shove it in the face of every politician, and every police chief, and ask them one question.
[01:42:25.577 --> 01:42:27.398]  Why do you cover up the truth?
[01:42:29.319 --> 01:42:30.340]  What's the answer to the question?
[01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:36.503]  Well, they have to answer the question as to why they cover up the truth.
[01:42:36.564 --> 01:42:37.985]  You want them to answer?
[01:42:38.125 --> 01:42:41.569]  We can supposition the answer for them, but yeah, sure, they need to answer the question.
[01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:45.332]  The police chief knows he has no legal obligation to defend people.
[01:42:45.372 --> 01:42:46.153]  Why does he cover it up?
[01:42:47.054 --> 01:42:48.134]  Here's a case of a woman.
[01:42:48.194 --> 01:42:50.915]  She had a restraining order against her stalker.
[01:42:51.555 --> 01:42:54.536]  California gun laws are complicated, to say the least.
[01:42:54.576 --> 01:42:58.698]  She believed, based on that predicate, that she could carry a concealed firearm.
[01:42:58.718 --> 01:42:59.478]  To what, folks?
[01:42:59.518 --> 01:43:03.399]  Not to go out and murder innocent people, but to protect herself from a stalker.
[01:43:03.719 --> 01:43:05.600]  What ended up happening to this particular woman?
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:12.622]  She didn't, I guess, get caught by the stalker, but they did, I guess, put her in a state of fear because she can't protect herself.
[01:43:12.922 --> 01:43:13.182]  Correct.
[01:43:13.829 --> 01:43:14.109]  Correct.
[01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:17.171]  How much of this is going on around the country, Aaron?
[01:43:17.231 --> 01:43:18.572]  I'm sure you have thousands of these.
[01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:21.534]  Oh, there's probably tens of thousands of cases like that on a daily basis.
[01:43:22.495 --> 01:43:27.359]  Again, because the police and the politicians cover up the truth.
[01:43:27.619 --> 01:43:33.663]  They don't want the American people to know the truth, that the American people have no legal right to police protection.
[01:43:35.346 --> 01:43:44.449]  And we saw that again in the Katrina disaster in New Orleans, where they were actually confiscating a lot of guns.
[01:43:44.849 --> 01:43:46.770]  The image is burned in my mind, Aaron.
[01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:53.132]  I don't know if you saw the old lady who was dragged out, put in a FEMA truck, and taken to a FEMA camp because she had a firearm.
[01:43:54.173 --> 01:44:03.796]  Well, that one I did not see, but I know that we refer to the whole thing in New Orleans going on as the brown-shirting of New Orleans.
[01:44:04.935 --> 01:44:09.418]  Because what the government was doing there is exactly what Nazis would do.
[01:44:10.038 --> 01:44:13.561]  They wanted to take guns away from people and make them defenseless.
[01:44:14.922 --> 01:44:17.163]  Claiming that they were going to make them safer.
[01:44:17.183 --> 01:44:18.704]  It's the same old lie.
[01:44:19.344 --> 01:44:21.786]  Simply the same old lie over and over and over again.
[01:44:22.977 --> 01:44:24.257]  I gotta bring this up to you.
[01:44:24.277 --> 01:44:30.059]  Again, Aaron Zellman, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, JPFO.org.
[01:44:30.079 --> 01:44:33.839]  And their video, Innocence Betrayed, is available at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:42.201]  We'll be giving out the phone numbers and any appropriate information so you can get that there is a special today at InfoWars with a t-shirt and the video, Innocence Betrayed.
[01:44:42.341 --> 01:44:43.422]  Excellent, excellent work.
[01:44:43.642 --> 01:44:47.502]  I've got to ask you about this Aaron Boot campaign taking off.
[01:44:47.843 --> 01:44:49.683]  You take exception to the BATFE?
[01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:51.857]  Do we take exception?
[01:44:52.098 --> 01:44:52.438]  Yes.
[01:44:53.038 --> 01:44:54.799]  To dishonesty and criminality?
[01:44:54.999 --> 01:44:55.259]  Yes!
[01:44:55.299 --> 01:44:57.279]  We do take exception!
[01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:03.202]  It's called boot the BATF, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
[01:45:04.142 --> 01:45:09.704]  We have some incriminating material that the American public was never meant to see.
[01:45:09.724 --> 01:45:17.767]  It's a video showing a so-called BATF expert trying to make a malfunctioning semi-auto rifle
[01:45:18.927 --> 01:45:25.649]  Uh, fire full auto and then claiming that because it fired twice in a row, with one pull of the trigger, it was a machine gun.
[01:45:26.509 --> 01:45:30.930]  They tried to take an innocent American, ruin his life, throw him in prison.
[01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:33.211]  They've been doing this for years now.
[01:45:33.991 --> 01:45:39.853]  And there are innocent people sitting in jails, prisons, who shouldn't be there.
[01:45:39.953 --> 01:45:42.573]  The Republican Party doesn't give a damn, by the way.
[01:45:42.613 --> 01:45:45.534]  And people need to come to grips with that immediately.
[01:45:46.331 --> 01:45:51.193]  They've got to just get their head out of the sand about Republicans are not our friends, they are our enemies.
[01:45:51.553 --> 01:45:52.494]  About enemies.
[01:45:53.314 --> 01:46:11.823]  But, and if you look at all the evidence we put on our website, much of it is free to download by the way, the articles, the interviews, the Congressional, the report that was done by the CRS, the Congressional Research Service, finally admits that there's been no
[01:46:13.183 --> 01:46:31.168]  Clear and scientific method for testing firearms, and it's been done at the whim of the local agents, the field agents, who then present themselves as experts in court, and the judges are too stupid to know the facts, and the jury apparently doesn't know the facts either.
[01:46:31.788 --> 01:46:35.809]  Or the judges are more corrupt than I think they are, and they don't want to know the truth.
[01:46:36.729 --> 01:46:39.590]  They just want to increase their pension by helping people.
[01:46:40.876 --> 01:46:41.636]  Go to prison.
[01:46:41.916 --> 01:46:52.018]  You go on to say that we must also adopt the attitude that anyone, that is anyone who supports, defends or apologizes for the BATFE or any, for any reason should be given the boot as well.
[01:46:52.038 --> 01:47:00.440]  You guys are actually running a massive campaign to get rid of the BATFE and of course you've been getting a lot of hate mail for doing this?
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.580]  We've been getting some of it.
[01:47:03.821 --> 01:47:06.961]  We're running the campaign in the Washington Times and Shotgun News.
[01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:08.662]  It'll be distributed at the SHOT Show.
[01:47:09.302 --> 01:47:10.502]  We're working up new ads.
[01:47:11.583 --> 01:47:13.245]  Uh, to keep the campaign fresh.
[01:47:13.926 --> 01:47:19.071]  We've been getting a good financial support from our, uh, DooseBang members at JPFO.
[01:47:20.172 --> 01:47:23.655]  Uh, so if you see one of the ads, thank a JPFO member for it.
[01:47:24.796 --> 01:47:26.638]  I'm trying to think of one.
[01:47:26.678 --> 01:47:35.947]  We're trying to help people understand what the problem is and what has to be done and how our friends in Congress are not our friends at all.
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:38.201]  Well, I wanted to go there as well.
[01:47:38.221 --> 01:47:45.887]  I mean, you said that the Republicans are our enemies, but that is, of course, assuming that the Democrats... We know the Democrats are our enemies on this issue of the Second Amendment.
[01:47:46.427 --> 01:47:47.908]  But at least they're honest about it.
[01:47:47.948 --> 01:47:49.850]  Well, yeah, they're honest.
[01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:54.353]  People look upon the Democrats as communists, but communists are honest.
[01:47:54.373 --> 01:47:55.935]  They always say what their agenda is.
[01:47:56.655 --> 01:48:00.198]  They're more than happy to take two steps forward, one step back, but they've made progress.
[01:48:00.838 --> 01:48:04.081]  The Republicans, from my perspective, quite frankly, are cowards.
[01:48:04.784 --> 01:48:06.485]  You never know what a coward's going to do.
[01:48:06.505 --> 01:48:08.167]  You never know when they're going to sell you out.
[01:48:08.607 --> 01:48:11.289]  This is what kills me, Aaron, is that people actually vote.
[01:48:11.349 --> 01:48:21.558]  They go vote on the one issue of gun rights, thinking that automatically conservatives and Republicans are going to defend that right for them, when that's exactly the opposite of what's really going on.
[01:48:22.098 --> 01:48:33.807]  Well, considering that the Republicans have been in charge for a number of years in Congress, and the criminal activities of the DATF have not been curtailed, someone has to explain
[01:48:34.895 --> 01:48:37.397]  of what their interpretation of friendship is.
[01:48:38.238 --> 01:48:43.902]  How well funded is the anti-gun lobbyist as opposed to the pro-gun lobbyist?
[01:48:43.982 --> 01:48:47.284]  I mean, can you match up their budgets at all and see who's more powerful?
[01:48:48.025 --> 01:48:56.191]  Well, you know, if we could reach 16 million gun owners and wake them up, we could surpass their budget.
[01:48:56.831 --> 01:48:57.692]  Why is that?
[01:48:57.732 --> 01:48:59.253]  That seems to be the biggest problem.
[01:48:59.393 --> 01:49:00.554]  A lot of gun owners are just
[01:49:01.488 --> 01:49:02.049]  Why is that?
[01:49:02.129 --> 01:49:05.252]  Why don't gun owners care about gun rights?
[01:49:05.512 --> 01:49:10.056]  Why don't people who drive cars care about the freedom that you should have driving your car?
[01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:11.577]  I mean, it just doesn't make any sense, Aaron.
[01:49:12.538 --> 01:49:13.159]  Well, I don't know.
[01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:22.107]  I mean, I'm not a psychologist, but it makes you wonder just if people... You know, someone won't defend their rights, and should they even complain about having the right?
[01:49:22.127 --> 01:49:26.952]  I mean, if someone won't pony up some money and keep gun ownership alive,
[01:49:27.546 --> 01:49:29.967]  Then they must think their old gun collection is worth five dollars.
[01:49:30.067 --> 01:49:36.190]  It's again a real naive assumption that Republicans automatically protect your right to keep and bear arms.
[01:49:36.230 --> 01:49:39.771]  We're going to come back more with Aaron Zellman, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms.
[01:49:39.851 --> 01:49:43.853]  Ownership, you're listening to Alex Jones Program, GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:43.913 --> 01:49:45.433]  I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:49:54.177 --> 01:49:57.018]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.765 --> 01:49:59.046]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.266 --> 01:50:04.988]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.268 --> 01:50:10.529]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:14.931]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[01:50:15.131 --> 01:50:18.916]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.176 --> 01:50:23.822]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:23.922 --> 01:50:30.170]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.230 --> 01:50:32.053]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:50:50.249 --> 01:50:52.331]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.

[01:51:06.474 --> 01:51:12.940]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:14.461]  to below detectable levels.
[01:51:14.742 --> 01:51:18.665]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:25.412]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:25.652 --> 01:51:31.137]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[01:51:54.454 --> 01:51:54.914]  Thank you.
[01:52:09.759 --> 01:52:10.399]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.272 --> 01:52:42.355]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.535 --> 01:52:48.481]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:54.106 --> 01:52:59.250]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:52:59.931 --> 01:53:02.233]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:05.743 --> 01:53:06.664]  Aaron Zellman with us.
[01:53:06.744 --> 01:53:09.027]  Choose for the preservation of firearms ownership.
[01:53:09.348 --> 01:53:15.176]  Their website is www.jpfo.org.
[01:53:16.718 --> 01:53:20.483]  Currently there is a major special on their website.
[01:53:20.823 --> 01:53:24.764]  Video, Innocence Betrayed, which will come with a Alex Jones t-shirt.
[01:53:24.824 --> 01:53:26.685]  I'm actually wearing one of those t-shirts right now.
[01:53:26.705 --> 01:53:29.346]  If you want more information, certainly go to Infowars.com.
[01:53:29.366 --> 01:53:34.668]  I believe there is a icon up where you can immediately locate this video, Innocence Betrayed.
[01:53:35.168 --> 01:53:38.449]  Also, you can give us a call at 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or you can simply write Alex Jones, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100,
[01:53:47.732 --> 01:53:48.953]  Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:53:49.373 --> 01:53:53.196]  Again, all of that information at Infowars.com.
[01:53:53.256 --> 01:53:55.238]  Prisonplanet.com.
[01:53:55.658 --> 01:53:57.039]  Aaron, I want to take a call or two.
[01:53:57.079 --> 01:54:00.081]  I know we're limited in time with you, but I want to try to get callers in if we can.
[01:54:00.101 --> 01:54:02.523]  I want to call for, if I could just mention something.
[01:54:03.084 --> 01:54:03.244]  Sure.
[01:54:03.264 --> 01:54:11.930]  To give people a better grasp of what the documentary is all about that you're selling, it shows the connection between gun control and genocide.
[01:54:12.731 --> 01:54:15.813]  And it goes back over 100 years of different genocides.
[01:54:16.477 --> 01:54:21.059]  Showing that the registration laws have led to confiscation.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:27.583]  And so it's a very good tool for showing that people who think gun control is wonderful and changing their minds.
[01:54:28.363 --> 01:54:34.826]  Yeah, I mean we really have to take a look back in history to really understand the concept and I've seen the film and it does an excellent job of that.
[01:54:35.146 --> 01:54:44.411]  You know, I would hedge to bet if you have friends out there that are liberal, that are against gun ownership, this would be really the perfect video to show them.
[01:54:44.451 --> 01:54:45.772]  It will really open their eyes
[01:54:46.452 --> 01:54:52.493]  And if you have friends who are Republican, you need to really nudge them and ask them, what have the Republicans done for you lately?
[01:54:52.513 --> 01:54:54.713]  I think would be a good question to ask.
[01:54:55.094 --> 01:54:56.014]  Be sure to answer.
[01:54:56.294 --> 01:54:58.074]  Yeah, and get an answer, too, by the way.
[01:54:58.374 --> 01:55:01.035]  Matt is in Austin, Texas, calling into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:55:01.075 --> 01:55:02.655]  Matt, we got you up with Aaron Zellman.
[01:55:02.675 --> 01:55:03.275]  Thanks for calling.
[01:55:03.775 --> 01:55:04.215]  Hey, Jack.
[01:55:04.235 --> 01:55:04.675]  How are you doing?
[01:55:04.695 --> 01:55:05.435]  Can you hear me all right?
[01:55:05.475 --> 01:55:05.855]  You're good.
[01:55:06.576 --> 01:55:08.756]  OK, that's exactly what I was going to say.
[01:55:08.816 --> 01:55:11.996]  But first, we were going over some of Sarah Brady's quotes.
[01:55:12.016 --> 01:55:14.877]  We were doing some segment for The Revere Show.
[01:55:15.538 --> 01:55:27.707]  And basically her quotes that some of them are a lot of contradictory to each other but one of her quotes is our goal is total disarmament and basically to have a socialist disarmed population and also as far as the
[01:55:28.610 --> 01:55:36.172]  Uh, to tell the conservatives, even if you think Bush is an angel, do you want this infrastructure and this, you know, precedent set up for when Hillary's in office?
[01:55:36.572 --> 01:55:40.893]  Or when, a hundred years from now, somebody is in office, another Hitler, let's say.
[01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:48.415]  Well, also, and to tell, uh, for the liberals, you know, that are, uh, that are starting to wake up and believe that Bush is becoming a fascist dictator,
[01:55:49.843 --> 01:55:51.944]  Ask them, do they want to be disarmed under that system?
[01:55:52.204 --> 01:55:53.525]  Is that the place they want to be?
[01:55:53.825 --> 01:55:54.245]  Their pants?
[01:55:54.706 --> 01:55:55.886]  Yeah, good points, Matt.
[01:55:55.946 --> 01:55:56.807]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:56.907 --> 01:55:57.907]  Aaron, you want to comment on that?
[01:55:57.928 --> 01:56:02.410]  I mean, obviously you just said a minute ago that liberals come out and tell you what they want.
[01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:04.492]  They want everybody to give up their guns immediately.
[01:56:04.512 --> 01:56:07.974]  He was commenting on Sarah Brady quotes.
[01:56:08.254 --> 01:56:13.077]  Yeah, I think that the gentleman has a pretty good grasp of what has to be told to people.
[01:56:14.238 --> 01:56:16.799]  I would add some caution about that Sarah Brady quote.
[01:56:16.859 --> 01:56:18.140]  I have seen people who have
[01:56:18.843 --> 01:56:21.604]  Claim it's right and claim it's wrong.
[01:56:22.705 --> 01:56:23.966]  I'd look into it a little more.
[01:56:24.946 --> 01:56:29.228]  Let's hit up Wyatt in Maryland who's holding for Aaron Zellman.
[01:56:29.268 --> 01:56:30.609]  Wyatt, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:31.269]  Thank you for calling.
[01:56:31.289 --> 01:56:31.850]  Hey, Jack.
[01:56:32.290 --> 01:56:33.270]  How you doing, Mr. Zellman?
[01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:34.351]  Fine, yourself?
[01:56:34.931 --> 01:56:37.452]  I'm really happy with what you guys do.
[01:56:37.692 --> 01:56:38.433]  I think it's terrific.
[01:56:39.793 --> 01:56:40.634]  Let me make a statement.
[01:56:41.614 --> 01:56:42.915]  It's not a question, it's a statement.
[01:56:45.276 --> 01:56:46.317]  Just bear with me a second.
[01:56:47.711 --> 01:56:56.976]  The misconception, and Mr. Zolan, by the way, I congratulate you for not using the word firearms, except in the presentation of the name of your group.
[01:56:57.716 --> 01:57:04.420]  You've said guns throughout your entire guest spot here, which is correct.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.441]  Fire, hold me over please.
[01:57:07.738 --> 01:57:08.939]  Can we hold you over, Aaron?
[01:57:08.959 --> 01:57:10.219]  You want to stay for one more segment?
[01:57:10.239 --> 01:57:11.140]  A couple of more minutes with us?
[01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:11.760]  You have the time?
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:13.081]  A couple more minutes.
[01:57:13.221 --> 01:57:13.621]  We got you.
[01:57:13.641 --> 01:57:14.902]  Maybe seven or eight more minutes.
[01:57:15.002 --> 01:57:18.943]  One more segment with Aaron Zellman-Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership.
[01:57:19.043 --> 01:57:20.904]  Gun ownership is why it points out.
[01:57:21.305 --> 01:57:24.146]  Third hour of the Alex Jones Show coming up right after this.
[01:57:24.186 --> 01:57:24.946]  Stay tuned, folks.
[01:57:24.966 --> 01:57:26.027]  We'll be back in about 70 seconds.
[01:57:33.217 --> 01:57:37.800]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:38.180]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.683 --> 01:57:51.743]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.463 --> 01:57:53.544]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.224 --> 01:57:55.024]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.784 --> 01:57:56.724]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.344 --> 01:58:01.045]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.525 --> 01:58:05.646]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.766 --> 01:58:15.448]  We are live, we are in Austin, Texas, this 23rd day of January 2006, but of course you can tell
[01:58:16.332 --> 01:58:17.513]  I am not Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.553 --> 01:58:19.854]  I'm Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[01:58:19.915 --> 01:58:22.656]  Tomorrow, the next day, Alex will be back on Thursday.
[01:58:23.237 --> 01:58:24.077]  Glad you can join us.
[01:58:24.097 --> 01:58:25.798]  We've been talking about the Second Amendment.
[01:58:26.459 --> 01:58:35.825]  Gun control for the last hour with us hanging over from the last leg of the second hour is Aaron Zellman, judge for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[01:58:35.885 --> 01:58:38.727]  That website again is JPFO.org.
[01:58:39.067 --> 01:58:40.248]  Aaron, thanks for staying with us.
[01:58:40.288 --> 01:58:42.249]  If we can just keep you for a couple of more minutes here.
[01:58:42.450 --> 01:58:44.911]  I want to go back to Wyatt who wanted to make a comment.
[01:58:44.931 --> 01:58:46.132]  We want to give him a chance to get that on the record.
[01:58:46.272 --> 01:58:48.634]  Okay, great, great.
[01:58:49.014 --> 01:58:51.296]  Firearms fall under the Treasury Department.
[01:58:52.317 --> 01:58:54.399]  Guns come in several forms.
[01:58:54.419 --> 01:58:59.803]  You've got a revolver, semi-automatic, a long gun, which has a rifle barrel and a shotgun.
[01:59:00.844 --> 01:59:08.950]  When you purchase a gun, it becomes, from a licensed dealer, it becomes a federally-estate-controlled firearm at that point.
[01:59:09.811 --> 01:59:11.332]  Then that's when the BATF has
[01:59:12.935 --> 01:59:13.936]  We're good to go.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:33.800]  It has arms.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:35.061]  It's protected under that.
[01:59:35.101 --> 01:59:42.324]  If you're registered, you're going to fall prey to all the federal rules and regulations and the state rules and regulations that go with that pistol.
[01:59:42.364 --> 01:59:43.604]  And you sign it away!
[01:59:43.884 --> 01:59:44.384]  Or rifle.
[01:59:44.424 --> 01:59:45.445]  You sign it away.
[01:59:45.885 --> 01:59:48.146]  Now, this is never brought about or talked about.
[01:59:48.166 --> 01:59:52.688]  I have never heard the NRA or Gun Owners of America or anyone ever talk about this.
[01:59:53.048 --> 01:59:55.509]  The thing is, if people understand this,
[01:59:56.469 --> 02:00:02.994]  They can still fight to keep their guns, even though they're firearms, by understanding it and demanding it be changed.
[02:00:03.615 --> 02:00:17.024]  Without a clear understanding of this, it'll continue to be a question where the socialist, communist arm of this government, in many forms, come after your firearms.
[02:00:17.184 --> 02:00:18.545]  Mr. Zelman, you want to comment on that?
[02:00:19.666 --> 02:00:21.368]  This is a great theory.
[02:00:23.119 --> 02:00:27.462]  I must have, I haven't had time to really think about it clearly, but it's an interesting way to look at it.
[02:00:28.763 --> 02:00:31.004]  Let me just give you another possible solution.
[02:00:31.945 --> 02:00:37.269]  JPFO has been looking into helping people learn how to build their own guns.
[02:00:38.590 --> 02:00:49.618]  A few people realize you can actually build your own firearms, your own AR-15s as an example, your own AKs, your own pistols, and you don't have to put a serial number on it.
[02:00:50.686 --> 02:00:56.298]  And as long as you build it yourself and you realize you can't sell it, you own it, it's yours.
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:01.428]  You can have a gun that is not registered and it's legal and
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:06.602]  You can have all kinds of guns, and I would just encourage people to learn more about it.
[02:01:06.622 --> 02:01:11.424]  You see, I would have thought that would be highly illegal, and the BATFE would be kicking down my door if they did.
[02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:11.884]  No, no, no.
[02:01:12.024 --> 02:01:13.465]  You can't even sell off a shotgun.
[02:01:13.545 --> 02:01:20.428]  No, well, you see, you're playing their game by selling off a shotgun, because now you're falling into their definition.
[02:01:21.148 --> 02:01:27.431]  But to build your own gun, if you go to the front page of Action, you can go to the BATF page, and they will tell you
[02:01:28.075 --> 02:01:31.217]  What their guidelines are for people building their own firearm.
[02:01:31.257 --> 02:01:34.239]  Do you have to have like a manufacturer's license?
[02:01:34.259 --> 02:01:35.719]  No, that's just it.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:46.626]  As long as you build it for yourself, your own personal use, like making your own wine or your own beer, growing your own tobacco, your own personal use, you don't need a license.
[02:01:46.886 --> 02:01:49.107]  I think a lot of the listeners are going to be very interested in that.
[02:01:49.147 --> 02:01:52.169]  And again, do you have information at JPFO.org on this?
[02:01:53.089 --> 02:01:57.212]  I'm going to send people to a website and it's called KT Ordinance.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:05.406]  Just go on Google and punch in the initials KT and the word Ordinance.
[02:02:05.426 --> 02:02:09.830]  They specialize in making receivers for AR-15s.
[02:02:10.831 --> 02:02:15.575]  They call it a frame actually because it's only 80% completed and you have to finish the other 20%.
[02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:19.464]  But the frame, the receiver, is the firearm.
[02:02:19.604 --> 02:02:31.909]  Well, you know, that was worth having you on today's program alone, Aaron, and I really have to jump on board with you and champion the end of the BATFE before they add another letter to the end of that slogan.
[02:02:31.929 --> 02:02:34.550]  So have people go to our site and learn more about BATFE.
[02:02:34.690 --> 02:02:39.191]  JPFO.org, Aaron Zellman, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms ownership.
[02:02:39.232 --> 02:02:42.673]  Thank you so much for joining us today, Aaron, and I'd like to have you on my show real soon.
[02:02:42.693 --> 02:02:44.133]  We'll have to contact you about that.
[02:02:44.153 --> 02:02:45.594]  We'll be right back, folks, right after this.
[02:02:46.388 --> 02:02:49.230]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:51.071]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.411 --> 02:02:56.074]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.435 --> 02:03:03.159]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.499 --> 02:03:05.481]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.681 --> 02:03:08.524]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.604 --> 02:03:13.288]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.488 --> 02:03:17.892]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.132 --> 02:03:25.339]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.599 --> 02:03:28.041]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.201 --> 02:03:29.923]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:46.517 --> 02:03:55.600]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:07.083]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.403 --> 02:04:13.105]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.365 --> 02:04:20.011]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.231 --> 02:04:27.056]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:27.337 --> 02:04:29.098]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[02:04:29.358 --> 02:04:31.400]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:33.722]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.

[02:04:45.014 --> 02:04:53.656]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[02:04:54.016 --> 02:04:58.756]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[02:04:59.097 --> 02:05:03.037]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[02:05:03.397 --> 02:05:08.398]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[02:05:08.838 --> 02:05:12.619]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care,
[02:05:12.899 --> 02:05:13.540]  We're good to go!
[02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:41.298]  3-8-4-1 to learn more.
[02:05:41.578 --> 02:05:42.718]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:05:49.621 --> 02:05:50.301]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.941 --> 02:05:52.022]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.702 --> 02:05:53.882]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.482 --> 02:05:55.303]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.043 --> 02:05:57.123]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.604 --> 02:06:01.585]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.785 --> 02:06:05.887]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.172 --> 02:06:09.174]  Jack Blood with you today.
[02:06:10.555 --> 02:06:12.077]  Jackblood.com.
[02:06:12.358 --> 02:06:13.259]  That is my website.
[02:06:14.781 --> 02:06:20.669]  I do the program on this network following the Alex Jones Show, Monday through Friday, 2 to 4 p.m.
[02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:22.692]  Yeah, we get pretty loose on that show, folks.
[02:06:23.897 --> 02:06:25.018]  No rules.
[02:06:25.158 --> 02:06:26.559]  That is the rule we live by.
[02:06:26.599 --> 02:06:27.340]  The only rule.
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:31.162]  There are no rules, except for the ones that we impose upon ourselves.
[02:06:31.523 --> 02:06:33.864]  I think that both of those interviews were pretty enlightening.
[02:06:33.884 --> 02:06:37.687]  I don't do a lot of Second Amendment stuff on my program.
[02:06:37.727 --> 02:06:42.831]  We'll do a full two-hour show on it and really go deep down the rabbit hole, so to speak.
[02:06:42.871 --> 02:06:46.314]  But in two quick 30-minute interviews, I think we learned quite a lot there.
[02:06:46.714 --> 02:06:49.096]  Again, Richard Pearson and www.
[02:06:50.016 --> 02:07:00.183]  ISRA.org, Aaron Zellman at JPFO.org, JPFO.org, if you want to find out more information about those guests and get behind their effort.
[02:07:00.223 --> 02:07:13.733]  Again, the video, Innocence Betrayed, is an excellent view of the historical gun banning that has gone on and of course the subsequent enslavement of the people because of these massive overall government gun bans.
[02:07:14.213 --> 02:07:15.654]  And yes, it is a pattern.
[02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:17.195]  It is right out of the playbook.
[02:07:17.535 --> 02:07:20.177]  And of course, the Republican Party is doing nothing.
[02:07:20.237 --> 02:07:33.346]  And when we vote for Republicans because we're against gay marriage, or we're against abortion, or we think that they're going to preserve our Second Amendment right, we fall right into that trap, don't we?
[02:07:33.386 --> 02:07:37.209]  I mean, it doesn't matter for me if a person is independent, libertarian,
[02:07:37.629 --> 02:07:41.759]  Democrat or Republican, I want to know where they really stand on the issues.
[02:07:41.799 --> 02:07:43.102]  I want to look at their track record.
[02:07:43.122 --> 02:07:44.485]  I want to see how they voted.
[02:07:44.505 --> 02:07:46.370]  I want to see if they stood up.
[02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:56.244]  And made a very loud noise about some of these perennial issues that can't be anything more important than your God-given right to keep and bear arms.
[02:07:56.804 --> 02:08:07.488]  Yes, a lot of these issues are important and, you know, look, you're going to have your own opinion where you might stand on gay marriage or abortion or these types of things, which I consider to be state issues and not federal issues.
[02:08:07.528 --> 02:08:08.829]  That's part of the problem.
[02:08:09.209 --> 02:08:11.190]  But overall, if we don't
[02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:18.397]  If we don't back up these people to reinforce our Second Amendment right, we're not going to have it.
[02:08:18.417 --> 02:08:21.420]  And we're seeing this happen in state after state after state.
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:30.909]  And of course, it's no coincidence that these cities that ban guns, handguns or otherwise, firearms if the case may be, pay the consequences.
[02:08:31.736 --> 02:08:49.704]  The data and the facts show that violence goes up in those areas, whereas guns are either mandatory, as they have been in a few towns and cities around the country, or in the case of Florida now, where you have the right to protect yourself either in or out of your house with your firearm.
[02:08:50.044 --> 02:08:52.925]  We see that the crime rate goes down exponentially.
[02:08:52.985 --> 02:08:53.986]  Here in Texas,
[02:08:54.688 --> 02:09:06.759]  I believe the home invasion is the lowest in the entire nation because criminals know that if they're going to break into your house here in Texas there's a good chance you're going to be locked and loaded and it could be quite dangerous.
[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:12.284]  So of course criminals prey on the weak and we encourage you not to be weak.
[02:09:12.364 --> 02:09:13.746]  That's very very important.
[02:09:13.766 --> 02:09:15.027]  I want to go back to the calls
[02:09:15.487 --> 02:09:15.767]  Again, 800-259-9231.
[02:09:15.787 --> 02:09:19.929]  We're going to take calls for the rest of the program today.
[02:09:19.949 --> 02:09:21.729]  Of course, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:21.749 --> 02:09:26.591]  Before I do, real quick, we have a number of specials here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:26.791 --> 02:09:32.593]  If you have not seen Martial Law, Rise of the Police State, that is about three movies in one.
[02:09:33.153 --> 02:09:36.034]  It talks about Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones.
[02:09:36.094 --> 02:09:39.555]  It talks about the Nazi-ification of America.
[02:09:39.935 --> 02:09:40.716]  We're good to go.
[02:10:01.074 --> 02:10:01.916]  We're good to go.
[02:10:16.173 --> 02:10:21.118]  I believe $15 discount if you get occultism exposed to the combo.
[02:10:21.378 --> 02:10:23.360]  Protect Your Children book special.
[02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.601]  Three superb books.
[02:10:24.981 --> 02:10:26.262]  Another amazing discount.
[02:10:26.402 --> 02:10:27.303]  Almost discounted.
[02:10:27.503 --> 02:10:29.825]  In fact, it is discounted.
[02:10:29.845 --> 02:10:31.146]  $20 off the usual rate.
[02:10:31.687 --> 02:10:32.868]  Red, white, and blue.
[02:10:32.888 --> 02:10:35.210]  9-11 DVD special.
[02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:38.993]  Three powerful 9-11 documentaries in one package.
[02:10:39.354 --> 02:10:41.275]  Marked down almost $30 from the original price.
[02:10:43.497 --> 02:10:45.641]  Uh, reveal the New World Order planned special.
[02:10:45.761 --> 02:10:49.567]  Two killer DVDs to shed light on the New World Order.
[02:10:49.887 --> 02:10:52.592]  Mark down $10 from its normal price.
[02:10:52.932 --> 02:10:58.381]  So really folks, this is a huge, huge sale on all of these great documentaries.
[02:10:58.661 --> 02:10:59.782]  And I have all of these, folks.
[02:10:59.842 --> 02:11:06.887]  I mean, these are what lines my studio walls are hundreds and hundreds of books and videos and documentaries.
[02:11:07.227 --> 02:11:08.848]  And it keeps me very well informed.
[02:11:08.908 --> 02:11:13.891]  And I know that if I need to reach somebody, I'll have the material right at hand.
[02:11:13.951 --> 02:11:18.094]  Of course, any of these can be copied and passed out for educational purposes.
[02:11:18.354 --> 02:11:22.618]  Go to Infowars.com now or call 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or simply mail a check for the appropriate amount for your order.
[02:11:22.658 --> 02:11:24.640]  Alex Jones, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.681]  3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:11:46.808 --> 02:11:51.210]  I mean, I've just found that Alex Jones and Infowars has the best information out there.
[02:11:51.250 --> 02:11:58.692]  They have the best collection of documentaries out there, including the new Dylan Avery second director's cut of Loose Change.
[02:11:59.453 --> 02:12:03.714]  The Codex Magica by Tex Mars, which I'm reading right now, is fantastic.
[02:12:03.774 --> 02:12:06.055]  The pictures alone tell a story.
[02:12:06.495 --> 02:12:14.038]  You think you have the whole picture, and then you realize there's so much more to know, and that book is a real godsend to all of us.
[02:12:14.358 --> 02:12:15.838]  We're going to go back to these calls.
[02:12:15.878 --> 02:12:19.920]  We have a ton of news to cover, but anything that you want to bring up is fine.
[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:23.460]  I did want to talk about all these mining accidents.
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:25.061]  Maybe you want to pipe in on that.
[02:12:25.401 --> 02:12:36.204]  We found that, again, there is cronyism involved with the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of the Interior, who had vowed to wipe out all of these mining regulations.
[02:12:36.224 --> 02:12:40.545]  He was a mining lobbyist put in to protect miners.
[02:12:40.685 --> 02:12:43.846]  One of his jobs, to protect the mines and the miners.
[02:12:44.426 --> 02:12:52.575]  And of course, with all of these accidents now, we have to start getting the picture that this is another Hegelian dialectic problem-reaction solution.
[02:12:52.875 --> 02:12:54.157]  We have the problem.
[02:12:55.054 --> 02:12:56.115]  Good to see you, man.
[02:12:56.315 --> 02:12:57.236]  Good to hear you, at least.
[02:13:22.642 --> 02:13:25.264]  Yeah, you're definitely doing Alex justice today.
[02:13:26.164 --> 02:13:32.948]  Um, I was going to say just first, uh, you should come back to the belly of the beast sometime and, uh, visit us on Rupert space.
[02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.929]  You haven't been on in a while.
[02:13:33.949 --> 02:13:34.729]  We kind of miss you there.
[02:13:35.090 --> 02:13:35.410]  Okay.
[02:13:36.190 --> 02:13:40.173]  Um, I'll, I'll just touch on some things that have already been discussed.
[02:13:40.533 --> 02:13:50.039]  Uh, you were, they were talking about the, uh, guns being taken away in New Orleans and, uh, since this has been a second amendment rights show, I'll just focus on this first.
[02:13:50.737 --> 02:13:53.039]  It hasn't been mentioned, Free State Project.
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:55.261]  FreeStateProject.org.
[02:13:55.561 --> 02:14:08.091]  It's a group organization bringing together pro-constitution, pro-freedom, you know, basically minimize government and maximize freedom.
[02:14:08.131 --> 02:14:10.453]  And their target state right now is New Hampshire.
[02:14:11.094 --> 02:14:14.917]  And they're getting like 15,000 people to move there and working towards legislation.
[02:14:14.937 --> 02:14:19.401]  But the reason I bring it up, ironically, with that situation you're talking about in New Orleans is because
[02:14:20.129 --> 02:14:31.416]  After what happened there with the cops trying to take away everyone's guns, is that they're now working to pass a law in New Hampshire that if there is an emergency situation like that, that the cops cannot take the citizens' guns away.
[02:14:32.177 --> 02:14:45.105]  Do you think it's dangerous somehow to gather everybody together that could be, I guess, considered freedom fighters or seditious in some way, and putting them all in one place and saying, here we are?
[02:14:45.125 --> 02:14:47.186]  I mean, is that dangerous in your mind at all?
[02:14:48.591 --> 02:15:09.686]  I mean, I guess you could take it to the extreme if it was some of these status bootlickers that these people are seditious, but all they want to do is make an example of New Hampshire of how well a free market economy and the maximum liberty and minimum government works.
[02:15:10.006 --> 02:15:10.866]  How well it works.
[02:15:12.247 --> 02:15:15.690]  When we get these people out of our lives and are allowed to
[02:15:16.508 --> 02:15:20.889]  Um, have self-determination again, that states will just follow suit.
[02:15:20.949 --> 02:15:23.150]  Everyone else will follow suit when they see how well it works.
[02:15:23.210 --> 02:15:35.434]  Yeah, I'm a big believer in reinforcing and taking over your local communities, and of course, you know, running for city council, replacing these corrupt politicians with, you know, people who revere freedom.
[02:15:35.734 --> 02:15:37.295]  I think that's really important.
[02:15:37.595 --> 02:15:44.737]  I know down here in Texas, I don't want to mention any particular city, Dave, but this has been going on here in Texas in a few towns where a number
[02:15:45.357 --> 02:15:55.500]  of people who are freedom oriented moving into a certain community and really taking it over and fighting off the massive powers that be and they've been successful doing that.
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:58.361]  I haven't kept track of the Free State Project though, Evan.
[02:15:58.381 --> 02:15:59.301]  How is that growing?
[02:15:59.341 --> 02:16:00.501]  Is that really catching on?
[02:16:00.561 --> 02:16:03.782]  Is it actually working yet or it's been a few years now since they started it?
[02:16:04.722 --> 02:16:13.385]  Yeah, I mean as far as I know I haven't done a ton of reading on it but there's obviously if they're already trying to enact laws and they're getting laws put on at least into the
[02:16:14.537 --> 02:16:26.782]  They're in for them, you know, so they have got people elected and they're moving towards that maximum freedom, minimum government.
[02:16:26.882 --> 02:16:31.184]  I like it too because it signifies that people are doing something.
[02:16:31.204 --> 02:16:34.385]  They're not just sitting back waiting for others to do for them.
[02:16:34.405 --> 02:16:38.707]  They're not just sitting back hoping that the government doesn't mess with them too bad.
[02:16:38.727 --> 02:16:44.089]  They're at least trying to control their own destiny and you have to credit people for that.
[02:16:44.730 --> 02:16:45.330]  Yeah.
[02:16:45.511 --> 02:16:53.496]  Okay, on some other things, one of the callers called in about the free fall of the World Trade Center.
[02:16:53.736 --> 02:16:53.976]  Right.
[02:16:54.376 --> 02:17:05.924]  And I would point out that if you take Newton's Law of Falling Bodies and you input the height of those towers, the amount of time it should take them to fall at free fall speed is 9.2 seconds.
[02:17:06.064 --> 02:17:12.428]  Now, if you take a stopwatch and time them as they fall, it's only about 8 tenths of a second slower than free fall speed.
[02:17:13.067 --> 02:17:17.849]  And with all of that massive resistance, it's almost... I mean, it is impossible for that to have happened.
[02:17:17.889 --> 02:17:19.109]  It defies physics!
[02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:25.071]  Which is exactly what the BYU professor Stephen Jones tried to say before he was somewhat censored.
[02:17:25.411 --> 02:17:25.871]  Exactly.
[02:17:25.891 --> 02:17:28.352]  I have a couple... I have two other major points.
[02:17:28.412 --> 02:17:30.333]  Well, I can hold you over real quick on the other side.
[02:17:30.353 --> 02:17:32.513]  We've got Bill in New York and others patiently holding it.
[02:17:32.533 --> 02:17:33.734]  We're going to get everybody on.
[02:17:33.754 --> 02:17:35.374]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:35.534 --> 02:17:37.835]  Infowars.com GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:45.293 --> 02:17:50.595]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:17:50.795 --> 02:17:52.876]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:17:53.116 --> 02:18:00.218]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:18:00.358 --> 02:18:11.862]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:18:12.262 --> 02:18:19.647]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[02:18:19.927 --> 02:18:24.911]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[02:18:25.051 --> 02:18:30.074]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[02:18:30.354 --> 02:18:36.418]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:46.104 --> 02:18:49.086]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.386 --> 02:18:58.410]  Did you know that the Lenin School of Political Warfare has laid down a plan for a third world war that will destroy both Christianity and Communism at the same time?
[02:18:59.131 --> 02:19:04.613]  From the rubbles of this war, the Illuminati will establish their world government prophesied in Revelation Chapter 13.
[02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:16.071]  Communism said they would pretend to collapse, and when America had begun to disarm, the combined communist world would launch a surprise attack and smash us with their clenched fists.
[02:19:16.863 --> 02:19:24.027]  We'd like to show you how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:19:44.056 --> 02:19:50.258]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:19:50.718 --> 02:19:58.500]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:06.702]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:20:07.002 --> 02:20:11.763]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:20:12.083 --> 02:20:16.787]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:20:17.307 --> 02:20:21.170]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:22.671]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:22:09.668 --> 02:22:14.791]  We're going to go ahead and take your calls for the rest of the program.
[02:22:14.831 --> 02:22:24.415]  We've got another, I believe, 35 minutes left, and then I'll be back for two more hours with Deadline Live with Jack Blood following the program, and you'll be able to hear it in all the
[02:22:25.015 --> 02:22:31.242]  I believe all the same usual methods, unless you're getting this on an AM affiliate, which we might not be on.
[02:22:31.422 --> 02:22:33.845]  I'm sending a message to the program directors now.
[02:22:34.085 --> 02:22:35.426]  Check out Deadline Live.
[02:22:35.727 --> 02:22:38.610]  Add two more hours after the Alex Jones program.
[02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:41.173]  We've made a great one-two punch over the years.
[02:22:41.913 --> 02:22:53.501]  But we'll have a special guest on that program, and I'll dive through a lot of this news that I eventually want to get to, because there is a lot of news, including this Russian general says 9-11 is a globalist inside job.
[02:22:53.541 --> 02:22:59.626]  You can find that on the front page of Infowars.com, so if you can't wait, you want to make sure you go read that.
[02:22:59.666 --> 02:23:01.807]  It's stunning, stunning, stunning information.
[02:23:02.127 --> 02:23:03.168]  We had Evan in Reno.
[02:23:03.268 --> 02:23:05.049]  Evan, you wanted to finish up here quickly?
[02:23:05.290 --> 02:23:05.710]  You got it.
[02:23:06.252 --> 02:23:08.153]  Yeah, just two quick things.
[02:23:08.694 --> 02:23:24.624]  One, you mentioned Tex's amazing book, and I know he goes into detail in that book about how they kill by numbers, and I was just doing some reading and research last night on Wellstone and his plane crash, and his plane crashed 11 days before the election.
[02:23:25.453 --> 02:23:34.016]  Yeah, that's true, and we did actually a whole show on that with Jim Fetzer from AssassinationScience.com.
[02:23:34.036 --> 02:23:35.136]  He really nailed it.
[02:23:35.396 --> 02:23:43.299]  You want to talk about numbers, April 19th, 2006 will be the 11 year anniversary of Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:23:43.659 --> 02:23:46.600]  So there you've got your 11 and you've got your April 19th 06.
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:52.022]  So I know a lot of people follow this type of thing and they believe they've decoded it.
[02:23:52.102 --> 02:23:59.585]  Unfortunately, it seems that we always really make the connections after the event and have not really been able to successfully predict any events.
[02:23:59.605 --> 02:24:00.605]  It's always hindsight.
[02:24:01.186 --> 02:24:08.968]  The other big thing was when you mentioned the hijackers and you weren't sure about it, I have seen the article and I have it right here in front of me.
[02:24:09.028 --> 02:24:10.409]  It's the BBC News article.
[02:24:11.063 --> 02:24:14.180]  There's at least four of them that are for sure confirmed alive.
[02:24:15.256 --> 02:24:17.097]  This is Sunday, September 23rd.
[02:24:17.498 --> 02:24:19.980]  I've seen all the stories, though.
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:23.783]  Look, I try to use common sense, and this is how I do it.
[02:24:24.463 --> 02:24:31.568]  And common sense is, if these guys are alive, wouldn't they be coming forward somehow?
[02:24:31.989 --> 02:24:35.331]  I've heard the protests, I've seen the articles that you reference.
[02:24:35.371 --> 02:24:41.296]  They are mainstream news articles, BBC, big international establishment newspapers.
[02:24:41.596 --> 02:24:43.757]  And it really caught my attention, let me tell you that.
[02:24:43.797 --> 02:24:54.443]  But the common sense thing to this, Evan, shows me that if they were alive, wouldn't they be out protesting at the top of the world, saying, hey, here I am, I'm alive, I'm not one of these hijackers.
[02:24:54.963 --> 02:25:05.028]  It's funny you say that, you use the word protesting, because it says in the article, about two paragraphs down, it says he's now protesting his innocence from Casablanca, Morocco.
[02:25:05.489 --> 02:25:09.811]  He told journalists there that he had nothing to do with the attacks on New York and Washington.
[02:25:10.307 --> 02:25:12.012]  And has been in Morocco when they happened.
[02:25:12.072 --> 02:25:16.185]  He has contacted both the Saudi and American authorities according to Saudi press report.
[02:25:16.852 --> 02:25:19.633]  Yeah, and these people never really come forward very far.
[02:25:19.753 --> 02:25:21.314]  Look, I keep an open mind to it.
[02:25:21.334 --> 02:25:32.238]  I gotta tell ya, because I did see one of the excuses from the government, that perhaps they had some of the names wrong, and that the people that they had initially... Yeah, well, the passport one was one of the ones they had wrong.
[02:25:32.579 --> 02:25:42.703]  Right, and that they'd initially gotten maybe a few of the names wrong, and that they've since revised the names, and they play pretty fast and loose with a letter in somebody's name, too.
[02:25:43.343 --> 02:25:45.604]  And bullets defy the laws of physics, right?
[02:25:46.064 --> 02:25:53.665]  You know, the thing is, I don't know if it's true or not, and I want to be very careful by saying, hey, the hijackers are alive, there's no doubt about it, that's the truth.
[02:25:53.785 --> 02:25:58.986]  I think that there's a very good case that could be the truth, but I want people to be careful with how they play with facts.
[02:25:59.607 --> 02:26:08.829]  I agree very much so, I just thought I'd point out that article there, and that, you know, it doesn't definitively prove like that person said, like, eight hijackers were alive.
[02:26:09.189 --> 02:26:09.489]  I know that.
[02:26:11.007 --> 02:26:14.040]  This one says that there's only, uh, what does it say?
[02:26:16.486 --> 02:26:21.229]  Uh, the identities of four of the 19 suspects accused of having carried out the attacks are now in doubt.
[02:26:21.329 --> 02:26:24.091]  So that, this was on September 23rd, 2001.
[02:26:24.551 --> 02:26:27.132]  In doubt, I think is probably the best way to put it.
[02:26:27.152 --> 02:26:27.753]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:27.833 --> 02:26:29.194]  It's not confirmed 100%.
[02:26:29.794 --> 02:26:42.801]  It deserves more investigation and unfortunately, you know, independent broadcasters like myself or independent researchers or investigative reporters don't have the financial resources in order to really follow up on some of these stories.
[02:26:42.841 --> 02:26:45.343]  That seems to be the unequivocal problem here.
[02:26:46.013 --> 02:26:49.754]  Yeah, it's a catch-22, you know, to the mainstream.
[02:26:49.994 --> 02:26:52.715]  We will know the truth, and the truth will set us free.
[02:26:52.795 --> 02:26:55.256]  That's something I do believe, and I think that you're right.
[02:26:55.296 --> 02:26:55.836]  That's in doubt.
[02:26:56.096 --> 02:27:00.277]  Tune in to tomorrow's show with Eric Huffschmid, and we'll go into that into detail for you, Evan.
[02:27:00.297 --> 02:27:01.317]  I appreciate the call.
[02:27:01.638 --> 02:27:04.418]  Let's move forward and go to John in Colorado.
[02:27:04.458 --> 02:27:06.539]  John, thank you for calling, and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:06.739 --> 02:27:09.460]  We're going to hold you over, because I didn't look at the clock, John.
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:15.864]  Few more minutes, you will be on the air as well as Richard in Omaha, Frank in West Virginia, and others patiently holding.
[02:27:15.904 --> 02:27:17.305]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:17.465 --> 02:27:19.787]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:19.947 --> 02:27:21.048]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:27:35.498 --> 02:27:36.398]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.899 --> 02:27:38.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.407 --> 02:27:42.077]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.422 --> 02:27:52.507]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[02:27:53.167 --> 02:27:53.948]  I'm Tex Mars.
[02:27:54.368 --> 02:27:58.571]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener.

[02:28:02.674 --> 02:28:11.520]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.

[02:28:16.022 --> 02:28:17.443]  Their mysterious symbols.
[02:28:17.783 --> 02:28:19.304]  Their hidden language.
[02:28:19.944 --> 02:28:20.804]  Encyclopedic.
[02:28:21.405 --> 02:28:22.005]  Documented.

[02:28:45.623 --> 02:28:51.866]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.006 --> 02:28:58.148]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.448 --> 02:29:06.872]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.112 --> 02:29:14.135]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.455 --> 02:29:19.278]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.478 --> 02:29:24.902]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.242 --> 02:29:28.304]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.645 --> 02:29:36.610]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:37.230]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.335 --> 02:29:49.777]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[02:29:50.037 --> 02:29:53.639]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[02:29:53.779 --> 02:30:01.922]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[02:30:02.162 --> 02:30:07.764]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[02:30:08.084 --> 02:30:13.349]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[02:30:13.589 --> 02:30:15.671]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[02:30:15.951 --> 02:30:28.102]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[02:30:28.322 --> 02:30:32.746]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installed in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[02:30:32.966 --> 02:30:33.927]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:30:34.107 --> 02:30:35.728]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[02:30:35.848 --> 02:30:37.650]  That's FilterMag.com.
[02:30:37.890 --> 02:30:38.810]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[02:30:38.871 --> 02:30:41.333]  That's 800-345-8376.
[02:30:41.353 --> 02:30:54.203]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.803 --> 02:30:57.766]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.989 --> 02:31:04.012]  Jack Blood sitting in for Alex Jones today.
[02:31:04.273 --> 02:31:05.695]  Jackblood.com.

[02:31:15.791 --> 02:31:18.953]  Central Time, Monday through Friday, again, jackblood.com.
[02:31:19.334 --> 02:31:21.995]  More information about all of this at gcnlive.com.
[02:31:22.056 --> 02:31:26.919]  You can, of course, listen to the program in 60 countries around the world.
[02:31:26.939 --> 02:31:28.941]  We're going right back to the calls, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:30.081 --> 02:31:35.025]  This is your Soapbox, and I believe, is it John in Colorado?
[02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:35.666]  Is that what's next?
[02:31:35.886 --> 02:31:36.766]  Yes, sir, Jack.
[02:31:36.786 --> 02:31:37.547]  You got it, John.
[02:31:37.587 --> 02:31:38.508]  Thank you for joining us today.
[02:31:39.028 --> 02:31:40.049]  Here's the thing, Jack.
[02:31:40.629 --> 02:31:42.090]  People better check it out.
[02:31:42.931 --> 02:31:46.713]  All states have been incorporated under the Communist UN Charter.
[02:31:47.554 --> 02:31:51.656]  Now, you go get a driver's license, you have contracted with the state.
[02:31:52.177 --> 02:31:54.858]  Right there you give up your constitutional rights.
[02:31:55.339 --> 02:31:55.819]  All of them.
[02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:58.581]  Now, we have one political party.
[02:31:59.221 --> 02:32:02.083]  Right-wing communist and left-wing communist.
[02:32:02.123 --> 02:32:04.545]  They call themselves Democrats and Republicans.
[02:32:04.745 --> 02:32:04.965]  Right.
[02:32:05.658 --> 02:32:06.198]  That's where we're at.
[02:32:06.218 --> 02:32:06.979]  That's where we're at right now.
[02:32:06.999 --> 02:32:09.780]  Now people need to get what their Secretary of State and demand a copy of their charter.
[02:32:26.348 --> 02:32:27.529]  They won't give it to you.
[02:32:27.589 --> 02:32:29.450]  They'll give you all kinds of excuses.
[02:32:29.570 --> 02:32:30.211]  You won't get it.
[02:32:30.711 --> 02:32:36.816]  Colorado has a 10 blanks of the Communist Manifesto in place and working now.
[02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:46.883]  Well, isn't it amazing if you follow the Ten Planks and the Congress Manifesto, as you mentioned, how many of them have become instituted here in our society?
[02:32:46.903 --> 02:32:54.166]  You know, there's something to be said about the illusion, I guess, call it the illusion, as it were, of the Constitution.
[02:32:54.226 --> 02:32:56.787]  I mean, it's time to call their bluff, though, don't you think?
[02:32:57.047 --> 02:33:06.651]  If they're telling us, John, that we have these constitutional, God-given rights, that we live by law here and we're a transparent society, then by God, we should call their bluff.
[02:33:08.103 --> 02:33:11.187]  They better go to Hebrews 12 for and read it.
[02:33:12.388 --> 02:33:16.413]  He said if you resisted sin unto blood.
[02:33:17.290 --> 02:33:19.591]  In other words, get off your butts and fight!
[02:33:20.031 --> 02:33:23.273]  Yeah, you love your country, you love freedom, it's worth fighting for.
[02:33:24.034 --> 02:33:29.236]  As I often say, you know the old adage, and it's very trite maybe to some people, but freedom isn't free.
[02:33:29.296 --> 02:33:35.900]  I'll go one step further as a revolutionary here and say, freedom isn't given, freedom is taken.
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:37.500]  John, I appreciate the call.
[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:38.261]  Thank you so much.
[02:33:38.401 --> 02:33:41.683]  Richard in Omaha, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:42.463 --> 02:33:46.205]  I just wanted to get the aid if you have access to that.
[02:33:47.178 --> 02:33:48.879]  800 number for the JFPO.
[02:33:49.679 --> 02:33:54.460]  I heard you give out the computer access, but nothing about the 800 number.
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:58.101]  Yeah, you just call into the Main Info Wars hotline, 888-253-3139.
[02:33:58.281 --> 02:34:00.962]  There's a special on the... Oh, I have that special.
[02:34:07.805 --> 02:34:13.250]  That's the one you want with the free t-shirt along with the video?
[02:34:13.350 --> 02:34:17.775]  I have that and I enjoy it immensely, especially the t-shirt.
[02:34:18.055 --> 02:34:28.405]  It's an amazing example of the history of what governments have done to take guns away from their people in order to again institute these draconian laws all on what?
[02:34:28.665 --> 02:34:30.046]  The basis of war!
[02:34:30.326 --> 02:34:31.808]  The basis of terrorism!
[02:34:32.068 --> 02:34:33.649]  I heard him say his website, but not the
[02:34:53.872 --> 02:34:54.553]  I don't have a computer.
[02:35:18.371 --> 02:35:19.452]  I don't know what to tell you, man.
[02:35:19.952 --> 02:35:20.312]  I can't.
[02:35:20.752 --> 02:35:21.953]  You're going to have to go to the library.
[02:35:22.033 --> 02:35:29.336]  I don't have the 800 number for Aaron Zellman, but I guess if you send me an email, I'll see if I can't get it for you.
[02:35:29.376 --> 02:35:30.537]  JackBlood at Hotmail.com.
[02:35:30.577 --> 02:35:31.457]  I don't have a computer.
[02:35:31.958 --> 02:35:32.438]  That's right.
[02:35:32.498 --> 02:35:33.438]  You don't have a computer.
[02:35:33.458 --> 02:35:34.639]  You can't send me an email.
[02:35:34.879 --> 02:35:36.080]  Why don't you have a computer?
[02:35:38.901 --> 02:35:40.822]  Several reasons.
[02:35:41.722 --> 02:35:43.463]  Even more, would you recall?
[02:35:45.154 --> 02:35:50.096]  Worried about the government invading, how do you call it, getting involved in everything?
[02:35:59.530 --> 02:36:00.330]  I'll tell you what I'll do.
[02:36:00.390 --> 02:36:01.731]  I'll try to have that number tomorrow.
[02:36:01.791 --> 02:36:04.731]  If you listen to the program tomorrow, I'll try to announce it for you, okay?
[02:36:05.171 --> 02:36:05.751]  Okay, thank you.
[02:36:05.771 --> 02:36:06.652]  That sounds like a deal.
[02:36:06.912 --> 02:36:08.872]  Let's talk to Frank in West Virginia.
[02:36:08.892 --> 02:36:09.972]  Frank, thank you for calling.
[02:36:09.992 --> 02:36:11.132]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:11.152 --> 02:36:12.373]  Hi, Jack.
[02:36:12.593 --> 02:36:14.613]  I have two things to mention, first of all.
[02:36:15.553 --> 02:36:18.854]  The last two weeks, a reception went out.
[02:36:18.954 --> 02:36:26.736]  I don't think Alex is aware of this, but the first broadcast in the afternoon, a reception goes out between 12.30 and 1.00 p.m.
[02:36:29.406 --> 02:36:30.486]  Sounds a little like jamming.
[02:36:30.826 --> 02:36:32.847]  It doesn't seem like some spots are the typical.
[02:36:32.887 --> 02:36:33.627]  How are you listening?
[02:36:34.407 --> 02:36:38.868]  By shortwave, 9.985 and 7.5 for the second hour.
[02:36:38.888 --> 02:36:45.029]  I wanted to also mention the same thing happened while you were on the air just a little while ago with Aaron.
[02:36:45.930 --> 02:36:50.911]  When he started to give out that link or that website,
[02:36:53.118 --> 02:36:57.661]  On how to complete a firearm, or rather... It's called KT Ordinance.
[02:36:57.721 --> 02:36:58.562]  That's what you Google.
[02:36:59.022 --> 02:36:59.402]  Okay.
[02:36:59.862 --> 02:37:03.845]  That went down just all of a sudden, just for short time.
[02:37:03.885 --> 02:37:05.046]  First time in the whole broadcast.
[02:37:05.086 --> 02:37:09.469]  Well, shortwave are somewhat susceptible to weather conditions and other things.
[02:37:09.569 --> 02:37:18.134]  I would direct your questions or complaints or concerns directly to the shortwave operator, shortwave stations that are carrying the program you listen to.
[02:37:18.154 --> 02:37:18.234]  Okay.
[02:37:19.483 --> 02:37:20.043]  Anything else?
[02:37:20.403 --> 02:37:32.088]  Yes, I want to mention, concerning that topic of guns, back in the Bible, this is applying to Christians, Jesus himself gave the command that we are to also have a weapon.
[02:37:32.609 --> 02:37:34.029]  He mentioned a sword in particular.
[02:37:34.049 --> 02:37:38.171]  He said, he that hath a purse, let him take it, likewise his script.
[02:37:38.231 --> 02:37:41.292]  And he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
[02:37:41.713 --> 02:37:44.134]  I used to wonder, why did he put that in there?
[02:37:45.666 --> 02:37:49.410]  After reading and studying and so forth, I looked, well, the context.
[02:37:49.931 --> 02:37:57.119]  This is for I say unto you that this that is written must be accomplished in me, and he is reckoned among the transgressors.
[02:37:57.159 --> 02:38:06.390]  Now, that was a reference to an Old Testament passage in Isaiah which refers to his sacrifice there on the cross for our sins.
[02:38:07.242 --> 02:38:18.331]  Well, wouldn't it be wonderful if we lived in a peaceful world, this utopia that all these New World Order types are trying to bring about with all this chaos, and we didn't need a gun to protect ourselves.
[02:38:18.511 --> 02:38:19.912]  Everybody was on the up-and-up.
[02:38:19.992 --> 02:38:24.595]  Everybody had a moral compass and didn't steal from others or didn't try to harm others.
[02:38:24.896 --> 02:38:27.818]  But the fact of the matter is, that is an illusion.
[02:38:28.078 --> 02:38:31.280]  We're no closer to that than we were 2,000 years ago.
[02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:32.962]  That's exactly right, Jack.
[02:38:33.042 --> 02:38:35.524]  And that's the point that was being made, is that
[02:38:36.798 --> 02:38:44.325]  The utopia, that paradise that Jesus will someday establish wasn't going to happen at that time.
[02:38:44.765 --> 02:38:48.709]  He came to die for our sins, not to set up that kingdom of his own.
[02:38:48.909 --> 02:38:51.411]  Someday it will get to be that way when he returns.
[02:38:52.412 --> 02:39:01.320]  That's the only time when the UN likes to quote that or misquote that verse and take it out of context about taking our weapons and
[02:39:02.162 --> 02:39:06.528]  And look at the hypocrisy here too.
[02:39:06.568 --> 02:39:16.882]  I mean a guy like Michael Moore makes a movie called Bowling for Columbine and it's very anti-gun, but I guarantee you he doesn't go anywhere without armed guards.
[02:39:17.222 --> 02:39:18.082]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:39:18.903 --> 02:39:19.863]  Same thing with Mike Wallace.
[02:39:19.883 --> 02:39:28.746]  And let me tell you, one thing I'm glad, there are plenty of victims out there who are anti-gun, including our Attorney General, who also is well-armed.
[02:39:29.066 --> 02:39:31.127]  I'm sure he doesn't want you to be well-armed, he's well-armed.
[02:39:31.147 --> 02:39:35.528]  But there are plenty of targets out there, Frank, that they won't get to me.
[02:39:35.609 --> 02:39:42.531]  The robbers, the criminals, the Al-Qaeda, they won't get to me because I'm not weak and I'm prepared.
[02:39:43.562 --> 02:39:48.389]  So thankfully there's a long line of liberals ahead of me that are going to make easy targets.
[02:39:51.273 --> 02:39:55.119]  And that goes for two of us and many of our listeners too.
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:59.886]  And that's the one thing that they're trying to get around, that is the New World Order.
[02:40:00.296 --> 02:40:05.298]  Is that they cannot take over until they disarm us, and that is not likely to happen.
[02:40:05.498 --> 02:40:13.481]  It's not likely to happen, and one thing I love about living in Texas, this is going to be the last state to be disarmed, and it won't be peacefully.
[02:40:13.821 --> 02:40:15.602]  Let me put it that way.
[02:40:15.982 --> 02:40:16.602]  Anything else, Frank?
[02:40:16.783 --> 02:40:17.423]  No, that'll do it, Jack.
[02:40:17.443 --> 02:40:17.803]  Thanks a lot.
[02:40:17.823 --> 02:40:18.923]  Hey, thanks for the call, man.
[02:40:18.983 --> 02:40:20.244]  Keep the peace and the faith.
[02:40:20.484 --> 02:40:21.144]  We got Chuck.
[02:40:21.304 --> 02:40:22.525]  Chuck, thank you for joining us.
[02:40:22.625 --> 02:40:22.985]  It's you.
[02:40:23.045 --> 02:40:24.165]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:24.546 --> 02:40:24.726]  Yeah.
[02:40:26.198 --> 02:40:30.443]  What I have is, I moved out here from Florida about two years ago.
[02:40:30.463 --> 02:40:39.715]  I left one of the last Parker Hill 300 Winchester Magnums back there with my sister.
[02:40:40.115 --> 02:40:41.637]  How do I get it to California?
[02:40:41.877 --> 02:40:45.281]  Do I have to take the firing pin out of it and have it shipped out here?
[02:40:46.337 --> 02:40:46.997]  What can I do?
[02:40:47.257 --> 02:40:55.301]  You know, I would contact somebody like Aaron Zellman or Richard Pearson and make sure that you're following the letter of the law.
[02:40:55.341 --> 02:40:57.222]  I mean, that really is the best way to go.
[02:40:57.302 --> 02:41:02.544]  Now, if you're asking me, what I would tell you probably wouldn't be legal, if you get my meaning.
[02:41:02.584 --> 02:41:03.064]  Wink, wink.
[02:41:03.925 --> 02:41:13.309]  Yeah, well, basically, you know, it's got a 6x18 scope on it, you know, Redfield on it, and I just used to use it for plinking.
[02:41:14.017 --> 02:41:28.204]  And I got out here, and I want to go out to the desert and blink, but with the California laws... It's really hard to interpret California laws, and I hope you're not moving to California, are you?
[02:41:28.985 --> 02:41:30.846]  I've been living here for two years.
[02:41:31.966 --> 02:41:44.836]  That's why I was trying to get my... You know, the laws are really funky and the best thing you could do would be to potentially, you know, contact your local chapter of the NRA to be really sure that you're following the letter of the law.
[02:41:45.237 --> 02:41:52.823]  I would assume that if you took the thing apart so that it wasn't able to fire and you put them in separate compartments... That's what I thought.
[02:41:52.843 --> 02:41:54.804]  If I had them take the firing pin out of it and
[02:41:58.464 --> 02:42:00.906]  No, maybe the scope off of it and stuff like that.
[02:42:01.026 --> 02:42:01.766]  I wish I could tell you.
[02:42:01.786 --> 02:42:10.231]  The thing is, I can't constantly be familiar with the laws of California because they're changing so rapidly that it would be impossible for me to give you accurate advice.
[02:42:10.251 --> 02:42:18.636]  And if you want that, I would just assume to go to your local NRA or your local gun activist, or of course there's a number of national organizations that you can talk to.
[02:42:18.697 --> 02:42:19.137]  But man,
[02:42:19.857 --> 02:42:21.458]  I don't know why you're living in California.
[02:42:21.518 --> 02:42:25.720]  It's beautiful and the people are wonderful, but it is a police state, no doubt about it.
[02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:28.981]  I mean, they are at least 10, 15 years ahead of the rest of the country.
[02:42:29.221 --> 02:42:33.243]  Oh yeah, well basically it's construction and it's the money out here right now.
[02:42:33.483 --> 02:42:34.704]  Where do you live in California?
[02:42:36.324 --> 02:42:41.727]  I really don't want to tell you off the air, but I'll tell you off the air of San Bernardino County.
[02:42:42.836 --> 02:42:48.059]  Well, look, I mean, I appreciate your efforts to hold on to your constitutional rights.
[02:42:48.099 --> 02:42:48.619]  Good for you.
[02:42:48.739 --> 02:42:54.762]  I would just make sure that if you don't want to get in any trouble that you make sure and find out exactly what the law pertaining to this is.
[02:42:55.002 --> 02:43:04.587]  Beyond flanking or whatever, you know, 90 grains of compressed powder will definitely take care of somebody that tries to come in your front door.
[02:43:05.231 --> 02:43:08.153]  Well, that's a tip for all you kids out there taking notes.
[02:43:08.234 --> 02:43:10.015]  Thanks for the call Chuck, I appreciate it.
[02:43:10.275 --> 02:43:12.217]  Keep on listening to the Alex Jones Program.
[02:43:12.457 --> 02:43:15.139]  Chris in Illinois, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:16.620]  Hello.
[02:43:17.001 --> 02:43:17.921]  Yes sir, you're on the air.
[02:43:18.562 --> 02:43:21.464]  Yes, I had a few questions actually if I had time.
[02:43:22.705 --> 02:43:28.350]  I've been researching InfoWars.com and other websites such as IlluminatiNews.com
[02:43:29.051 --> 02:43:30.852]  And I'm subscribed to Prison Planet TV.
[02:43:30.892 --> 02:43:34.794]  I don't know how I discovered all this or ran into it, but I have stumbled upon all this.
[02:43:35.654 --> 02:43:37.815]  And it just opened my mind completely.
[02:43:37.835 --> 02:43:39.756]  And there's a couple of things.
[02:43:40.356 --> 02:43:42.957]  There's just so much, but I've narrowed it down to a couple of things.
[02:43:42.997 --> 02:43:46.479]  The President's Information Technology Advisory Committee.
[02:43:48.039 --> 02:43:51.961]  I noticed it's the whole Google thing and the search engines thing.
[02:43:52.721 --> 02:43:56.023]  Well, I wanted to know if anybody realized that
[02:43:56.656 --> 02:44:00.459]  CEOs of major corporations are involved in government committees.
[02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:04.783]  I mean, these are... I think most people would assume that, at this point.
[02:44:05.723 --> 02:44:09.026]  I mean, you're talking about a major multi-billion dollar corporation.
[02:44:09.486 --> 02:44:14.070]  Here's the thing, and especially if this is what you're talking about, this big story with Google.
[02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:25.980]  Now, the government is demanding that they have access to Google's files and so that they can find out what you, for instance, Chris, might be Googling in order to use that against you at a further date.
[02:44:26.020 --> 02:44:27.661]  This is, of course, all for your safety.
[02:44:27.982 --> 02:44:29.443]  It's all to catch the terrorists.
[02:44:29.503 --> 02:44:32.586]  But, of course, we have to remember that we are the terrorists in the eyes of
[02:44:33.186 --> 02:44:35.449]  Not only our government, but governments around the world.
[02:44:35.789 --> 02:44:45.900]  And the thing is, is Google is being made out to be this kind of a radical, on-the-edge company that wants to protect your constitutional rights.
[02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:49.524]  But we've known, again this is just like the NSA spying thing, they've been
[02:44:50.305 --> 02:44:53.508]  They've been turning over lists to the government for years.
[02:44:53.548 --> 02:44:56.210]  They've been censoring news stories for years.
[02:44:56.250 --> 02:45:01.974]  I've been censored myself on Google, where they've spiked news stories that have become high on the list of Google.
[02:45:02.895 --> 02:45:08.439]  You know, so they're not an above-board company, and I think that this, again, really has much to do about nothing.
[02:45:08.479 --> 02:45:11.482]  Now, should we be glad that this issue is coming forward?
[02:45:11.782 --> 02:45:12.563]  I think we should.
[02:45:12.623 --> 02:45:13.984]  Do we know how it's going to end?
[02:45:14.004 --> 02:45:15.024]  I think we do.
[02:45:15.365 --> 02:45:19.448]  They're going to turn over everything the government wants, and we probably still won't know about it.
[02:45:20.017 --> 02:45:20.237]  Right.
[02:45:20.257 --> 02:45:21.958]  Is that your point?
[02:45:22.038 --> 02:45:23.318]  I mean, is that the question you're asking?
[02:45:23.858 --> 02:45:30.620]  Yeah, I basically wanted to know if people understood that major CEOs of large companies are involved in the government.
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:33.420]  I mean, it seems like it should be separated, but it's not.
[02:45:34.581 --> 02:45:39.262]  The tail wagging the proverbial dog, and of course we've seen all these lobbyist scandals and
[02:45:40.485 --> 02:45:47.167]  Money in politics, and that's of course another angle, something we're going to be hearing a lot about over the next year during these elections.
[02:45:47.247 --> 02:45:51.008]  And I think we should just assume that it's the golden rule, Chris.
[02:45:51.088 --> 02:45:52.628]  Those who have the gold make the rules.
[02:45:53.208 --> 02:45:53.428]  Right.
[02:45:54.248 --> 02:45:54.748]  Anything else?
[02:45:55.549 --> 02:45:56.709]  Yes, one more thing.
[02:45:57.469 --> 02:46:00.930]  Getting kind of usual, I guess, but I had a dream recently.
[02:46:01.010 --> 02:46:03.551]  This was before I discovered it on InfoWars.com.
[02:46:04.031 --> 02:46:04.691]  I had a dream.
[02:46:04.891 --> 02:46:09.372]  I was in the press room of the Pentagon, and it was just me and George Jr.
[02:46:10.362 --> 02:46:13.725]  And he looked at me and said, expect something terrible to happen in June of 2006.
[02:46:14.205 --> 02:46:17.188]  And I thought, OK, what's this mean?
[02:46:17.989 --> 02:46:19.130]  And I was kind of blown away.
[02:46:19.150 --> 02:46:21.812]  So I typed it in Google in a search engine.
[02:46:22.372 --> 02:46:26.496]  And it came up on the first link that I clicked on was Alex Jones's link.
[02:46:26.816 --> 02:46:29.979]  And it was something of a suspected terrorist attack in June.
[02:46:30.739 --> 02:46:33.822]  And I started researching things and putting some things together.
[02:46:33.842 --> 02:46:35.003]  And I noticed that
[02:46:36.414 --> 02:46:39.079]  The Patriot Act was due to expire around then, correct?
[02:46:39.681 --> 02:46:42.827]  Actually, it was initially, and then it got rolled back.
[02:46:42.867 --> 02:46:45.673]  It is expiring here in just about a week and a half.
[02:46:47.262 --> 02:46:56.108]  I think what a lot of people are pointing to in June, and I could be mistaken here, is June 6, because it will in fact be 666 with June 6, 2006.
[02:46:57.129 --> 02:46:58.610]  Right.
[02:46:58.790 --> 02:47:09.578]  We know that the Luciferians love those numbers, they love to kind of drop their gang calling cards, so to speak, and I think that people somewhat are apprehensive of that particular date.
[02:47:09.938 --> 02:47:15.122]  Also, most of the major predictions on the attack on Iran do come in June as well.
[02:47:15.976 --> 02:47:16.576]  Right, okay.
[02:47:16.877 --> 02:47:19.338]  Well, you know, I mean, I hope your dreams don't come true.
[02:47:19.358 --> 02:47:24.362]  You know, this is the moral to the story here, is that we don't want any of this to be true.
[02:47:24.762 --> 02:47:26.383]  Isn't that exactly where we're at?
[02:47:26.403 --> 02:47:30.946]  We would hope that we're wrong about everything we say on this program and on this network.
[02:47:31.266 --> 02:47:36.049]  Unfortunately, there is just so much data, so many documents to back up what we're saying.
[02:47:36.330 --> 02:47:37.150]  We're not wrong.
[02:47:37.230 --> 02:47:40.132]  Now, a dream, hopefully such as that, will not come true.
[02:47:40.673 --> 02:47:40.873]  Right.
[02:47:40.933 --> 02:47:42.174]  Now, what can we do?
[02:47:42.254 --> 02:47:44.015]  I mean, as an individual, I can't really
[02:47:44.395 --> 02:47:44.515]  Yeah.
[02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:58.153]  How do you... Well, first, yeah, you're playing right into their hands because it's all about fear.
[02:47:58.533 --> 02:47:59.234]  It really is.
[02:47:59.454 --> 02:48:02.936]  The more fear you have, the more power the globalists have.
[02:48:02.976 --> 02:48:18.187]  Let me tell you, if you take a look around now and you see some of the desperate measures, including the rolling out of Osama Bin Laden again here with this new fake, and I'm going to go on the record and say I believe that that videotape was manipulated and fake, you'll see how desperate they are.
[02:48:18.508 --> 02:48:20.269]  You've got them backed into a corner.
[02:48:20.669 --> 02:48:27.253]  And one person can go out and tell thousands and thousands and thousands of people about this type of information.
[02:48:27.593 --> 02:48:31.075]  One person can go to a city council meeting and affect change.
[02:48:31.315 --> 02:48:33.736]  Never underestimate the power of one.
[02:48:33.756 --> 02:48:35.537]  We'll be right back after this, folks.
[02:48:35.557 --> 02:48:39.199]  The Alex Jones Show final segment in this three-hour broadcast.
[02:48:39.219 --> 02:48:40.420]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:48:46.306 --> 02:48:53.694]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:53.975 --> 02:48:58.720]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:58.940 --> 02:49:04.587]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.827 --> 02:49:09.328]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.568 --> 02:49:16.711]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:16.751 --> 02:49:21.272]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.432 --> 02:49:23.933]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.173 --> 02:49:30.875]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:49:31.115 --> 02:49:36.384]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[02:49:53.088 --> 02:50:06.043]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:50:06.343 --> 02:50:09.644]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.984 --> 02:50:11.325]  But it's worth every penny.
[02:50:11.465 --> 02:50:20.448]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:20.748 --> 02:50:21.229]  That's right!
[02:50:21.429 --> 02:50:28.531]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.831 --> 02:50:32.953]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:51:45.911 --> 02:51:48.634]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:48.654 --> 02:51:52.557]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.283 --> 02:52:00.825]  Final segment in today's broadcast.
[02:52:00.865 --> 02:52:05.169]  Of course, I'm Jack Blood, sitting in for Alex Jones, who will be back Thursday, this Thursday.
[02:52:06.830 --> 02:52:09.333]  You don't know what you got till it's gone, folks.
[02:52:09.973 --> 02:52:10.614]  Remember that.
[02:52:11.591 --> 02:52:15.232]  Everybody's been real nice to me, and I'm really honored to be in the chair.
[02:52:15.272 --> 02:52:19.354]  I've done the best job I know how to do, and I will certainly try to do better tomorrow.
[02:52:19.374 --> 02:52:27.197]  Of course, Deadline Live, my program, two hours long, coming up here in just about five minutes, always following the Alex Jones program.
[02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:41.166]  You know, what we hear, and I'm not going to mention any names, but what we hear is these shadowy, invisible government types do all of this, and we don't know who they are, and of course, we don't know what to do.
[02:52:41.466 --> 02:52:43.508]  People always asking me, what can we do?
[02:52:43.548 --> 02:52:48.031]  Skeptics always saying, well, you guys are always so negative, and you never provide any solutions.
[02:52:48.979 --> 02:52:51.701]  And I gotta tell ya, that's not the truth.
[02:52:51.801 --> 02:52:53.142]  We do provide solutions.
[02:52:53.202 --> 02:52:54.322]  We give you names.
[02:52:54.642 --> 02:53:02.567]  You wanna know what's the Windsors, the Rothschilds, the DuPonts, the Reynolds, the Rockefellers, the Bushes, the Harrimans, the Hapsburgs, the Lees?
[02:53:03.147 --> 02:53:10.672]  Just to get started on a list of names of top globalists, I call them Neo-Pharaohs or Matrix Moles.
[02:53:11.292 --> 02:53:13.634]  You know, the rest of us are useless ears.
[02:53:14.574 --> 02:53:15.755]  At least that's how they see us.
[02:53:16.477 --> 02:53:29.835]  And they don't believe that we should have the right to protect ourselves, to protect our sovereignty, our individuality, our right to pursue higher consciousness, our right to think for ourselves and protect our families.
[02:53:30.235 --> 02:53:31.917]  They know what's better for us.
[02:53:32.678 --> 02:53:34.279]  And they are our caretakers.
[02:53:34.299 --> 02:53:39.880]  And that, of course, is the epitome of the Communist Socialist regime, totalitarian government.
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:54:00.107]  When we get into my program here, coming up very shortly, I'm going to talk about the former Russian military officer who says this is a New World Order, it is to gain one world government, and 9-11 was, of course, an inside job, as is all major terrorist events used to control the people.
[02:54:00.487 --> 02:54:03.568]  But the moral to the story is, there is something you can do.
[02:54:03.608 --> 02:54:05.908]  You first take responsibility for yourself.
[02:54:06.228 --> 02:54:09.229]  You become an example for others to follow.
[02:54:09.569 --> 02:54:14.230]  And that may sound like a lot of hard work for you, but I'll tell you the payoffs are many.
[02:54:14.290 --> 02:54:25.172]  To know that you're doing everything you can to protect the freedoms and liberties in your country and around the world, and for your neighbors, for your community, and for your family,
[02:54:25.712 --> 02:54:48.422]  Certainly has its own rewards as the saying often goes the truth will set you free and I believe that if you don't pursue the truth and you don't make sure other people have access to the quote-unquote truth or at least the facts to set the record straight so that people have the whole story then you aren't exactly free and that might be why you have paranoia that might be why
[02:54:48.482 --> 02:54:48.782]  Why?
[02:54:49.063 --> 02:54:50.404]  You have a lot of fear.
[02:54:50.844 --> 02:55:05.498]  I've got to tell you, when you stand up bold and straight, and you go up against these critters, these creatures that want to put together this totalitarian one-world government, you immediately start receiving more power.
[02:55:06.138 --> 02:55:09.902]  I often end my program, in fact I end my program every day just like this.
[02:55:10.002 --> 02:55:13.065]  Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid.
[02:55:13.746 --> 02:55:24.962]  So you need to be bold, you need to get out there in your community, you need to have people in your community with an infrastructure that reads and dissects every bill that goes to your legislators.
[02:55:25.729 --> 02:55:35.053]  You need to have an organized effort of people that will get up and stand up and stop these draconian pieces of legislation from going into your communities.
[02:55:35.253 --> 02:55:39.475]  You need to talk to your neighbors, even though the globalists would not have you talk to your neighbors.
[02:55:39.795 --> 02:55:43.577]  And you need to form a coalition in your own communities.
[02:55:43.677 --> 02:55:48.118]  So start with that, and we're always willing to be right here and help you along the way.
