[00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:18.827]  Alright folks, I tell ya, we are live and this is Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:23.992]  We thought we'd have that little pregnant pause there to bring up the suspense for you today.
[00:00:25.064 --> 00:00:32.193]  And coming up later in the broadcast, we're going to be talking about the national toll road system that's going in.
[00:00:32.393 --> 00:00:42.405]  Finally, more and more mainstream media is starting to report on this, how the railways are being given to Mexico, the ports to China, and the United Arab Emirates.
[00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:46.086]  They're going to have a monopoly over all of the infrastructure.
[00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:52.308]  This has always been part of the globalist plan, and now it's starting to come to fruition.
[00:00:52.328 --> 00:01:01.131]  So we have Sal Costello to give you a local view in one of the capital states of this takeover, right here in Texas, with the Texas Toll Party.
[00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:08.074]  And then coming up in the third hour, we have Jack Blood joining us, who's broken a major news story.
[00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.935]  For the last three weeks, he's had these secret documents
[00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:22.610]  from the Texas Department of Transportation and it is just bombshell info and that's going up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:28.276]  So in the second and third hour we'll be covering what's coming to a town, a city, a state near you.
[00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:44.191]  It's already moving ahead in Oregon, California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Texas, places like that, Florida, all over the place, but the frontline states are California, Texas, Missouri, and just a couple others, and it is just unbelievable.
[00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:53.659]  It isn't toll roads, folks, it's international lanes, it's international sectors, it's actually handing the country over to globalism.
[00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:55.841]  You see, you thought they'd never be able to just
[00:01:56.463 --> 00:01:59.544]  Create the Pan-American Union, hand us over to the world government.
[00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:00.425]  But they are!
[00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:08.368]  They're already grabbing all of the key infrastructure that matters and handing it over to international bodies or international private companies.
[00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:10.469]  And it's all done as part of sweetheart deals.
[00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.871]  So the government buys up and takes over all the land and then starts handing it over to their private corporate cronies.
[00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:18.452]  So that's coming up.
[00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:21.951]  There is so much news we'll be covering in the first hour.
[00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:26.637]  In the meantime, Abu Ghraib leaked report reveals full extent of abuse London Guardian.
[00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:29.240]  Now we knew this a year ago in the Senate.
[00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:35.810]  ...was actually allowed to see, quote, hundreds of videos and thousands of photos, and we have the Army's report saying what was in those.
[00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.572]  Beating people to death, raping people, that's all admitted.
[00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:41.634]  But now, others are being able to see some of these photos.
[00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:42.495]  What's in them?
[00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:49.299]  1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, tortured to death, 546 images.
[00:02:56.877 --> 00:03:00.039]  29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts and much more.
[00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.839]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.123]  Of course, you know, Houston police chiefs announced he wants a law passed in the city that any new home has to be built with cameras in it.
[00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:08.803]  Watching you.
[00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:10.264]  We're not kidding.
[00:03:10.324 --> 00:03:10.804]  It's real.
[00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:11.885]  Associated Press.
[00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:18.068]  And that dovetails nicely with this article Paul Watson put together out of the Australian Daily Telegraph.
[00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.370]  Latest airline terror threat, people who read books.
[00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:27.335]  Rocker Henry Rollins reported for thought crime for reading a best-selling book on the plane.
[00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:30.503]  And they told him, don't ever read that kind of book again or you're a terrorist.
[00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:32.686]  I'm not kidding.
[00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:35.567]  This is in mainstream news, and we have polls, comments on it as well.
[00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:40.209]  And there's all this hype about global warming, and the answer is global taxation, of course.
[00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.810]  Nothing to stop global warming if it's really happening.
[00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.291]  That's debatable, of course.
[00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:50.213]  But global taxation, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is leading the way at the state level to implement that.
[00:03:50.514 --> 00:03:53.435]  So we'll get into that as well for you.
[00:03:54.498 --> 00:04:00.503]  And we have reports of China and Iran are nearing a huge oil deal amid China threat U.S.
[00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:03.365]  to hold mammoth naval operations in the Pacific.
[00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:06.487]  Scientists set to answer South Korea's stem cell questions.
[00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:07.108]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:09.450]  Renewal of the Patriot Act is assured.
[00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.451]  The Lexington Herald is reporting.
[00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:12.512]  Will it be expanded?
[00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:13.693]  That's the question we'll answer.
[00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:15.454]  Also, Russia warns U.S.
[00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:17.115]  against striking Iran.
[00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:17.936]  More on Iran.
[00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:20.918]  And then articles I see every day like this one out of a Philadelphia newspaper.
[00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.500]  Should Big Brother be watching?
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.144]  And they're recasting Big Brother as good and helpful and a friendly fellow.
[00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:32.407]  Big national ID card fight going on over in the United Kingdom.
[00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:33.488]  More on U.S.
[00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:39.893]  lawmakers calling for renewal of the Dubai port deal that we mentioned just a little bit earlier.
[00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:46.201]  And much more on the other side of this quick break.
[00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:48.822]  And of course we've done our big forensics test.
[00:04:48.842 --> 00:04:52.864]  And that video is up on the websites of the Cheney shooting incident.
[00:04:53.244 --> 00:04:57.887]  And what we learned is absolutely 110% conclusive.
[00:04:58.427 --> 00:04:59.767]  So we'll detail that as well.
[00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:00.188]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.187 --> 00:05:08.033]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:09.735]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:12.137]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.277 --> 00:05:14.359]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.603]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.947]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:36.696]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.737]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:06:02.371 --> 00:06:03.431]  The War on Terrorism.

[00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:10.954]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.

[00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:06.846]  You heard that right.
[00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:09.387]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.

[00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:12.048]  The banks are defrauding you.

[00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:51.982]  Come over and get a rock-solid technology that wipes out debt without bankruptcy.
[00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:55.985]  All right, big broadcast lined up for you today on this Friday edition.
[00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:27.100]  We have several guests coming on about the infrastructure being handed over to international corporations and even to governments.
[00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:29.982]  And there's such denial about this.
[00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:35.746]  Last Friday, I mentioned an article about how six U.S.
[00:08:35.826 --> 00:08:36.207]  ports
[00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.112]  Are to be handed over to the United Arab Emirates and they're going to have a monopoly.
[00:08:41.132 --> 00:08:59.119]  They're getting all the major East Coast ports and then in case you want to try to bring it in and skip the Panama Canal and go to the West Coast, in case you want to try to go to New Orleans, they're buying that one too for a, what, $6.9 billion, a paltry sum, really, over time for what they'll get for it.
[00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:06.662]  And then once they own all those ports, they can jack up prices even further, bringing in all the wonderful slave goods from China and India.
[00:09:07.282 --> 00:09:08.863]  And people really were in denial about it.
[00:09:08.883 --> 00:09:10.983]  It didn't matter if I had mainstream news articles posted.
[00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:13.924]  I was getting calls going, oh, is that really true, Alex?
[00:09:13.964 --> 00:09:16.845]  Other hosts were going, oh, I don't know what he's saying is true.
[00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:18.466]  And I'm like, well, here's the news article.
[00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:20.507]  Now it's big, big news.
[00:09:21.147 --> 00:09:25.388]  And Congress is talking about a 60-day moratorium.
[00:09:25.508 --> 00:09:28.229]  And they're going to go do an investigation.
[00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:29.990]  This is how it works.
[00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.592]  There are two lobbyists, as we've talked a lot in the past about, two lobbyists for every member of Congress.
[00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:47.080]  There are lobbyists at the state level at an even greater number on average.
[00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:55.345]  And most of the lobbyists at the federal level, over half, are foreign registered agents.
[00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:57.646]  And I use this example a lot because it's a good one.
[00:09:57.666 --> 00:10:08.213]  A few months ago the Houston Chronicle reported, and I was very thankful for it, on something that we were already aware of here, that the chief lobbyist for the government of Mexico
[00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:20.729]  That aggressive state towards the south, the narco-terrorist state, that he had been hired by Rick Perry as the head of Texas-Mexico Affairs and Relations.
[00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:30.360]  While he was still a dual citizen of Mexico, he now sits in the governor's office running one of the most important offices.
[00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.271]  I mean, that's an example.
[00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:40.478]  In fact, it's not enough for the foreign lobbyists from Russia, China, England, France, hundreds of countries, Japan.
[00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:42.019]  It's not enough.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.341]  The Netherlands is one of the biggest.
[00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:50.967]  It's not enough that they come and pay off our politicians in plain sight of everyone.
[00:10:51.992 --> 00:11:14.274]  to literally hand over our infrastructure to private foreign companies and their own governments now we have to have them sitting in the government and of course a better example is AIPAC and that's the big Israeli lobbying consortium and they openly are one of the biggest lobbies in Washington DC
[00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:20.966]  And you've got Perl and Wormser and Wolfowitz and others who all have dual citizenship with Israel.
[00:11:21.387 --> 00:11:32.437]  In fact, some of them are primary citizens of Israel, openly running key Pentagon departments, and being Undersecretaries of Defense, and then they move on to be World Bank head, like Wolfowitz.
[00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:35.560]  This is all being done right out in the open.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.202]  I mean, we're going to have nothing but foreign leaders.
[00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:48.030]  Pretty soon I guess the foreign governments will just pay off the politicians to scrap the Bill of Rights entirely and maybe put a Chinese president in and call him emperor and put a gold crown on his head.
[00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:50.052]  You think I'm joking?
[00:11:50.332 --> 00:11:55.156]  It'll probably come down to that in a generation or so if we don't turn this around.
[00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:57.257]  It's simple.
[00:11:57.297 --> 00:12:03.102]  People want mansions and fancy cars and mistresses and you can pay them off to do it.
[00:12:03.712 --> 00:12:12.474]  And there's no oversight, because the FBI and the different law enforcement agencies are run and commanded by people on the payroll.
[00:12:12.534 --> 00:12:18.136]  I mean, Alberto Gonzales is the Attorney General, and when he was White House Chief Counsel, he said, Bush is the law.
[00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:20.036]  He's not above it, he is the law.
[00:12:20.076 --> 00:12:21.757]  We can torture to death whoever we want.
[00:12:21.777 --> 00:12:24.338]  And his deputy said, yeah, we can torture kids in front of their parents.
[00:12:25.518 --> 00:12:26.378]  That's John Hughes.
[00:12:26.558 --> 00:12:28.319]  So, this is cold tyranny.
[00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:29.419]  It has a name.
[00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:32.640]  And I heard Gary Brownfield this morning.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.620]  I commend him.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.361]  I was aware of this.
[00:12:34.401 --> 00:12:35.101]  We've mentioned it.
[00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:41.884]  How all the major railroad heads going up into the national hub that's going to be Kansas City and St.
[00:12:41.904 --> 00:12:44.966]  Louis, the two major hubs, but Missouri being the hub.
[00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:53.550]  From that point throughout the rest of the country, almost all the major railroads, but all the major spurs going into Kansas City and St.
[00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.952]  Louis are to be just handed over to Mexico.
[00:12:57.692 --> 00:12:58.873]  And it's finally in the
[00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.650]  The Kansas and Missouri newspapers.
[00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.271]  He was reading them.
[00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:08.052]  This is very pleasing to actually hear the nightmare being admitted.
[00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:13.213]  The major ports have been given to China, the Panama Canal, Long Beach, and many others.
[00:13:13.773 --> 00:13:15.413]  One of the major ports up in Seattle.
[00:13:16.233 --> 00:13:20.054]  All of the six major ports, deepwater ports, on the East Coast.
[00:13:20.154 --> 00:13:26.616]  And then, again, the only other major port other than Houston that's there is the Port of New Orleans.
[00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:28.136]  That's going to be given over to the Arabs.
[00:13:28.972 --> 00:13:30.774]  And because they got the money, folks.
[00:13:31.774 --> 00:13:37.138]  You see, our currency's now been debased by 45%, so all these foreign countries can buy us cheap.
[00:13:37.338 --> 00:13:44.864]  It's like the old joke back when the pesos were real weak, going down to Mexico to have fun for the weekend because you can stay out there for a week on $100.
[00:13:44.944 --> 00:13:47.346]  Well, not anymore because the dollar didn't work that much.
[00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:58.059]  Well, everybody's busy watching ball games and getting drunk and having a good time and having fun in the sun and going to the bowling alley.
[00:13:58.119 --> 00:14:05.087]  Whatever you do, and I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to go to the bowling alley or you shouldn't be able to go on a vacation, but that's all we're into is being decadent blobs.
[00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:25.620]  While we're being distracted, the takeover is taking place, and all the major roads in America, all the interstate highways, almost all the major state roads in Texas, it is all of them, are going to have toll roads just thrown onto them, and it'll be paid to the foreign Spanish company, with Juan Carlos the King as one of the major stockholders.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:34.643]  We've got big news coming up at the end of the next hour and into the third hour with Jack Blood, who's down here in Austin, and a
[00:14:38.124 --> 00:14:41.707]  Insider will just tell you, inside the state government has given him the documents.
[00:14:41.727 --> 00:14:46.770]  There have been many valiant whistleblowers that have gone public, and we've just broken the news of that.
[00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.751]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:56.937]  If you want to go read that story right now, you can do that, but we'll detail it on air coming up later.
[00:14:57.357 --> 00:14:57.978]  The roads are
[00:14:59.578 --> 00:15:08.400]  See, once they take over a road, an existing road, and make it a toll road, they don't even have to upkeep it, and they're not according to the same standards of highway quality.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:16.102]  But they get to, at the same time, even get money from the state to upkeep them, but not even according to code.
[00:15:16.502 --> 00:15:18.662]  So understand, see this is how these deals work.
[00:15:18.902 --> 00:15:20.943]  The government pays for upkeeping the roads.
[00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:31.147]  The government pays to police the roads, and for a pittance, the highways are just given to foreign corporations.
[00:15:31.608 --> 00:15:35.469]  It's total looting, just because they come in with money, and pay off your local politicians.
[00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.631]  You see, here's an example of a parallel.
[00:15:40.672 --> 00:15:43.873]  When you hear that in New London, Connecticut, they can take anybody's house they want,
[00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:50.096]  If a, quote, private interest can convince the local government to give them the land.
[00:15:50.136 --> 00:16:05.020]  But what you don't hear in the news, and what is in the local papers there, and what the eyewitnesses have talked about here on air, and we write articles about it and it can't get picked up nationally, because there's a block out on this, is that you're not paid for your land, the value of the home.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.822]  You are paid for condemned value, no matter if it's a beautiful Victorian home, valued on the tax rolls at $300,000 to $500,000.
[00:16:10.902 --> 00:16:11.902]  You are then only paid for the lot value.
[00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:17.149]  You see, this is what's happening.
[00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:29.699]  And the Supreme Court ruled, if a private interest wants your land, and says they can quote, do something better, and if they can get the local government to agree to it, so they're openly saying, you can come pay off the local government, and then take whatever you want.
[00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.581]  That is feudalism.
[00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:37.646]  That is the definition of classical feudalism.
[00:16:38.106 --> 00:16:38.726]  Serfdom.
[00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:40.248]  Neo-serfdom.
[00:16:41.228 --> 00:16:42.509]  Neo-feudalism.
[00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.471]  Look it up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:48.528]  And it is just bone-chilling to me to see this happening.
[00:16:49.088 --> 00:17:03.374]  And to see the general public in La La Land, meanwhile the police being militarized, being trained to be vicious like pit bulls, pit bulls, against the general population, quote, because there's a terror threat and they've got to keep us safe.
[00:17:03.394 --> 00:17:04.954]  And listen, you can't just place over this.
[00:17:04.974 --> 00:17:12.917]  Associated Press yesterday, press conference with the police chief of Houston, Texas.
[00:17:13.137 --> 00:17:14.658]  Five million people.
[00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:19.381]  The fifth largest city in the United States.
[00:17:19.981 --> 00:17:22.363]  Set to become the fourth largest city next year.
[00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:23.163]  Exploding.
[00:17:23.663 --> 00:17:25.164]  Seven million metro.
[00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:29.186]  Four and a half to five million, depending on what number you look at, in the city.
[00:17:29.807 --> 00:17:35.110]  They're trying to pass a law that every new home with the permit has to have cameras in it.
[00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.411]  Cameras in the home!
[00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:54.131]  I mean, listen, the Pentagon designed the program, the federal agencies paid the states a pittance with matching funds and unfunded mandates to put cameras up at every four-way stop in every one-horse town, every big city, everywhere.
[00:17:54.171 --> 00:17:58.415]  Neighborhoods, microphones going up the last decade, scanners, everything.
[00:17:58.455 --> 00:18:02.538]  License plate readers, it's all gone up and they keep saying it's for traffic, it's for traffic.
[00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:04.720]  Then they announce, okay, it's for law enforcement to fight terror.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.942]  That was always the stated plan in industry publications.
[00:18:08.262 --> 00:18:09.102]  Now they're doing it.
[00:18:09.643 --> 00:18:21.849]  The entire country is becoming a huge prison, but the border stays wide open because that's part of the plan to bring in slave labor wages, workers, to drive down the wages even further.
[00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:24.891]  So this is the program.
[00:18:24.911 --> 00:18:25.972]  This is the control grid.
[00:18:26.052 --> 00:18:31.555]  And then rock and roll star Henry Rollins is on an Australian flight
[00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:42.514]  And he's reading a best-selling book that has Jihad in the name, that I've seen in Barnes & Noble when I've been shopping, it's a best-seller, that's actually exposing Jihadists.
[00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:52.197]  And they land the plane, get him off, and tell him, you've got to apologize for being a terrorist.
[00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:58.159]  You better, I have the article right here, you better promise to never read anything like this on a plane again.
[00:18:58.897 --> 00:19:03.601]  The population is so dumb in the western world, book titles scare them.
[00:19:03.621 --> 00:19:03.801]  See?
[00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:04.702]  Book burning.
[00:19:04.722 --> 00:19:05.542]  Just a word.
[00:19:05.863 --> 00:19:06.763]  A white guy.
[00:19:06.783 --> 00:19:08.885]  A white guy.
[00:19:08.905 --> 00:19:12.148]  And I make that point because imagine how bad it is for someone with brown skin.
[00:19:12.728 --> 00:19:15.190]  I've got so many Hispanic friends that they can't even fly.
[00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:20.415]  And it doesn't matter if their name is Gonzales or something else.
[00:19:21.055 --> 00:19:21.796]  Ramirez.
[00:19:21.876 --> 00:19:22.596]  It doesn't matter.
[00:19:22.616 --> 00:19:24.017]  The people are so dumb.
[00:19:24.098 --> 00:19:25.659]  Oh, you must be an Arab terrorist too.
[00:19:27.364 --> 00:19:31.787]  And then I've seen them, the old World War II vets, going to a Pearl Harbor reunion.
[00:19:32.308 --> 00:19:33.308]  Others have seen this too.
[00:19:33.448 --> 00:19:34.909]  You know, with the oxygen tanks.
[00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.330]  And they're being harassed.
[00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.571]  It doesn't matter who you are.
[00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:44.496]  But the border's wide open, and then it comes out that they protected Mohammed Atta 13 times, because he was a government agent, and protected him.
[00:19:45.277 --> 00:19:46.678]  Lead hijacker, mainstream news.
[00:19:47.718 --> 00:19:52.021]  You see, you start to figure this out, the terrorists are in control of the government.
[00:19:52.422 --> 00:19:53.663]  The war is against you.
[00:19:55.223 --> 00:20:00.267]  I reckon the prize, folks, we're the prize!
[00:20:01.388 --> 00:20:03.069]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:20:03.489 --> 00:20:06.492]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:20:06.812 --> 00:20:12.076]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:20:12.396 --> 00:20:21.923]  Now there's Forever Fresh for the fridge, a revolutionary new product proven to eliminate refrigerator odors, and guaranteed to keep produce fresh at least twice as long as normal.
[00:20:22.203 --> 00:20:24.405]  Nancy McKimpson of Jacksonville, Florida says,
[00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:28.228]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:20:28.508 --> 00:20:31.730]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.553]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says... You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:39.176]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:20:39.316 --> 00:20:40.577]  I'm really amazed.
[00:20:40.717 --> 00:20:46.561]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:20:46.721 --> 00:20:49.123]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:54.345]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us.
[00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:57.606]  Or call toll-free 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:20:57.786 --> 00:20:59.787]  That's 1-866-NO-ODERS.
[00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:08.150]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.330]  One and the same.
[00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:11.371]  If you had deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1%,
[00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:19.871]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:20.292 --> 00:21:23.413]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:25.514]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:25.754 --> 00:21:28.595]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.136 --> 00:21:31.356]  Here is reality.
[00:21:31.717 --> 00:21:35.298]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:35.798 --> 00:21:39.460]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.862]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.184 --> 00:21:47.910]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:21:48.271 --> 00:21:49.453]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.473 --> 00:21:49.693]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:06.258]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:10.700]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.541]  We listened.
[00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:16.844]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:17.104 --> 00:22:17.604]  We listened.
[00:22:17.985 --> 00:22:21.026]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:21.447 --> 00:22:21.967]  We listened.
[00:22:22.427 --> 00:22:26.510]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:26.871 --> 00:22:27.371]  We listened.
[00:22:27.711 --> 00:22:32.956]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:34.717]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:35.097 --> 00:22:42.483]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:42.864 --> 00:22:46.307]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:07.652]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:20.716]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:23:20.896 --> 00:23:21.416]  Are you sick of
[00:23:21.496 --> 00:23:22.697]  Barely having enough money?
[00:23:22.857 --> 00:23:26.319]  Are you tired of working so hard, yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:30.381]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:23:30.641 --> 00:23:35.603]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:23:35.884 --> 00:23:37.584]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:23:37.845 --> 00:23:41.827]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:23:42.067 --> 00:23:43.888]  Zango is what you are looking for.

[00:23:50.211 --> 00:23:55.273]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N-Market.com.
[00:23:55.373 --> 00:23:58.494]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[00:23:58.514 --> 00:24:04.855]  Don't worry.
[00:24:05.316 --> 00:24:06.856]  This show is documented.
[00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:10.637]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:11.597 --> 00:24:14.238]  Some people think I'm sending a mixed message with that liner.
[00:24:14.758 --> 00:24:16.479]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:17.999]  No, we got the truth.
[00:24:18.019 --> 00:24:18.940]  We know who the crooks are.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.740]  We know what they're doing.
[00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:22.439]  It's a big global organization.
[00:24:22.479 --> 00:24:26.460]  Their policy reports and operational manuals, most of them are public.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:27.961]  And they're looting us.
[00:24:28.061 --> 00:24:33.343]  And this is how patronage works in an imperial system with these imperial companies.
[00:24:33.603 --> 00:24:44.907]  They just go and pay off the politicians, take over the public largess, and then gouge you to even use the infrastructure, the water, the power, the roads, energy, everything.
[00:24:45.767 --> 00:24:47.367]  And it's now happening.
[00:24:47.407 --> 00:24:48.628]  And I want to get more into that
[00:24:49.512 --> 00:24:54.656]  Let me just spend a few minutes, I also want to get into the NSA, Russell Tice testimony a few days ago.
[00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:57.277]  We have a ten minute clip of it in Congress.
[00:24:57.297 --> 00:25:14.428]  We can't air the whole thing today because we've got two guests coming on, but it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and what he says is, look there's 50 plus programs that I know about that are spying on everybody and what you're hearing from the President is nothing, it's the tip of the iceberg, but I'll be arrested if I tell you what I know.
[00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.829]  You can go watch it.
[00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:18.111]  And he said, I was in these programs.
[00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.672]  That's what's happening, you see?
[00:25:21.533 --> 00:25:25.398]  But we don't need Russell Tice in testimony to tell us this.
[00:25:25.438 --> 00:25:27.340]  It's all been declassified for decades.
[00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:33.148]  They just retroactively then say, oh no, you can't talk about it, because now they know that we're getting wise to it.
[00:25:34.207 --> 00:25:36.629]  You can go listen to a broadcast I did 11 years ago.
[00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:42.473]  I'm talking about the NSA and keyword computers and randomly listening to all the communications.
[00:25:43.033 --> 00:25:44.614]  And you know what I say?
[00:25:44.654 --> 00:25:45.515]  It doesn't scare me.
[00:25:45.535 --> 00:25:47.556]  It doesn't chill me they're doing that.
[00:25:47.837 --> 00:25:48.517]  I've known about it.
[00:25:48.537 --> 00:25:49.758]  That's why we're fighting it.
[00:25:50.659 --> 00:26:00.946]  And then you learn they were spying pre 9-11 and every time good federal agencies, defense intelligence, naval intelligence, FBI, CIA, they're full of good people!
[00:26:02.148 --> 00:26:10.596]  In most of the compartments of the bureaucracy, and every time they tried to go, these guys are terrorists, they're about to attack, back off, they're government agents in a high-level government training op.
[00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:17.282]  Do you understand we have the head of the Defense Language School, the Dean, went public and said he was forced to train the hijackers?
[00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:19.704]  Do you understand that's in Monterey, California?
[00:26:19.904 --> 00:26:22.066]  Do you understand it's public?
[00:26:22.306 --> 00:26:25.489]  Do you understand that they, we've had embassy heads on to say it?
[00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:30.550]  It's been in MSNBC, but it gets reported and no one pays attention to it.
[00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:32.711]  They were trained also at Air Force bases.
[00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:34.472]  They were government agents.
[00:26:34.852 --> 00:26:39.973]  Everybody keeps bumbling around, even in the 9-11 truth movement, not being able to figure out exactly how they did the attacks.
[00:26:40.193 --> 00:26:41.154]  They just know they did them.
[00:26:41.454 --> 00:26:43.214]  That is, i.e., elements of the government.
[00:26:44.054 --> 00:26:45.515]  Elements of the global corporate structure.
[00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:47.335]  We do know how they did it.
[00:26:47.375 --> 00:26:49.456]  We have the entire thing put together.
[00:26:49.496 --> 00:26:51.637]  We have every piece of the puzzle now.
[00:26:51.697 --> 00:26:52.817]  We've had it for years.
[00:26:53.655 --> 00:27:03.443]  And I'm very encouraged to see a lot of top scholars, scientists, intelligence experts, so many people now going, oh, we figured out what happened.
[00:27:04.084 --> 00:27:05.044]  Well, you can go see
[00:27:06.312 --> 00:27:06.932]  Martial law.
[00:27:06.972 --> 00:27:08.213]  You can see Masters of Terror.
[00:27:08.233 --> 00:27:11.534]  You can see films I made three and a half years ago.
[00:27:11.854 --> 00:27:15.275]  You can read articles I wrote three and a half years ago saying exactly what happened.
[00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:18.296]  And now, as time goes on, my stories don't get disproven.
[00:27:18.576 --> 00:27:20.997]  It just piles on the evidence that I was correct.
[00:27:21.277 --> 00:27:23.538]  Because I understand how they operate.
[00:27:23.778 --> 00:27:24.919]  Not because I'm that smart.
[00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:26.299]  I study these people!
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:28.220]  Okay.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:38.067]  I have, I don't know, what, five, six major servers, and some of them are the biggest servers you can get with just massive bandwidth and huge pipes.
[00:27:39.648 --> 00:27:45.253]  And last night, and you know we don't just say this for effect, our IT experts, it clearly happened.
[00:27:46.074 --> 00:27:56.683]  Last night after we uploaded my reenactment of the Cheney shooting from the Hill Country Rifle Range yesterday morning, at around 11 o'clock at night, actually 1130, we got done.
[00:27:57.905 --> 00:28:00.346]  And we uploaded it, and it was working fine from here.
[00:28:00.406 --> 00:28:03.787]  And when I got home at 12.30, I sat there and watched it work great.
[00:28:04.247 --> 00:28:13.651]  And yes, clearly someone went in and erased the entire server's video contents at about 3 a.m.
[00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:14.311]  this morning.
[00:28:15.476 --> 00:28:17.918]  They went in and erased the entire content.
[00:28:18.178 --> 00:28:20.219]  We had it backed up, uploaded again.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.741]  They came right through the firewall and did it.
[00:28:23.121 --> 00:28:25.403]  And so now we put it on, what, three servers?
[00:28:25.883 --> 00:28:28.125]  And we're expecting attacks on all three of those.
[00:28:28.205 --> 00:28:30.206]  Believe me, they don't want you to see this re-enactment.
[00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:39.773]  Because if this gets picked up on the web, and this gets syndicated on the web, and if this gets out to people, and if we can force the mainstream media to report on the fact that Cheney shot him up close, 100% proven,
[00:28:41.514 --> 00:28:50.241]  Forensically, we had an engineer there and a police officer there, and we had the same shotgun, we had the same loads, the seven and a half, all there!
[00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:55.205]  You understand immediately, within hours of it going up, we were hit.
[00:28:55.705 --> 00:28:58.027]  They went in and erased the entire server.
[00:28:58.508 --> 00:28:59.228]  It was wiped.
[00:28:59.308 --> 00:29:00.609]  The wipe command was put in.
[00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:01.410]  It didn't crash.
[00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:02.831]  It was wiped.
[00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:03.692]  It was wiped.
[00:29:04.072 --> 00:29:06.534]  And I just want to tell those that did this, you're not going to stop us.
[00:29:07.175 --> 00:29:09.196]  Everybody, go get it while you can.
[00:29:09.236 --> 00:29:10.337]  Put it on your server.
[00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:11.638]  It's a 10 minute video report.
[00:29:11.678 --> 00:29:12.419]  Very professional.
[00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:13.920]  Full of documents and video.
[00:29:15.081 --> 00:29:17.983]  Get the text report and put it on your servers.
[00:29:18.184 --> 00:29:19.345]  We've got to do this.
[00:29:19.425 --> 00:29:20.986]  We've got to do this now.
[00:29:22.265 --> 00:29:24.127]  We are under attack right now.
[00:29:24.967 --> 00:29:27.429]  We are trying to syndicate it through our server system.
[00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.252]  So when the enemy hits, they've got to hit multiple targets.
[00:29:30.292 --> 00:29:33.815]  We've got IT people watching them when they try to come through the doors.
[00:29:34.535 --> 00:29:39.780]  These are very sophisticated enemies we're fighting and they designed the entire software structure so they have back doors.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.601]  We're watching them, we're tracking them.
[00:29:41.942 --> 00:29:43.143]  We've got traces on them.
[00:29:43.563 --> 00:29:47.627]  But we are obviously under Defense Department attack.
[00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:50.409]  You need to go see the proof that Cheney shot him up close.
[00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:54.563]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.504 --> 00:29:58.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.914 --> 00:30:04.256]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:04.516 --> 00:30:06.557]  What was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:30:06.697 --> 00:30:13.782]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:14.022 --> 00:30:22.608]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:30:22.688 --> 00:30:22.888]  Yes!
[00:30:22.908 --> 00:30:27.594]  Now for the first time, Calbin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.

[00:31:01.306 --> 00:31:03.267]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.347 --> 00:31:14.072]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:18.954]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.034 --> 00:31:30.360]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.809]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.209 --> 00:31:40.332]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:45.799]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:31:46.099 --> 00:31:52.382]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.463 --> 00:31:56.665]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.885 --> 00:31:59.746]  That's toll free.
[00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:00.507]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:00.567 --> 00:32:03.708]  Call 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
[00:32:03.929 --> 00:32:12.153]  They'll haul away all that junk you need to make go away from your garage, storage, attic, job site, old office, home, or apartment.
[00:32:12.751 --> 00:32:16.213]  That's 1-800-GOT-J-U-N-K.
[00:32:17.513 --> 00:32:19.974]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:32:20.454 --> 00:32:22.355]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:32:23.076 --> 00:32:26.217]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:32:26.889 --> 00:32:27.590]  It is liquid.
[00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.590]  It is private.
[00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:29.711]  It owes no one.
[00:32:29.731 --> 00:32:31.112]  It cannot go bankrupt.
[00:32:31.472 --> 00:32:33.373]  And it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:32:34.154 --> 00:32:36.916]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:32:37.316 --> 00:32:40.218]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:40.518 --> 00:32:41.979]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:32:44.081 --> 00:32:46.982]  Spring cleaning?
[00:32:47.383 --> 00:32:48.864]  Call 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
[00:32:49.464 --> 00:32:56.649]  They'll haul away that unwanted stuff from your garage, storage shed, attic, job site, office, home, or apartment.
[00:32:57.236 --> 00:32:57.736]  Call today.
[00:32:57.756 --> 00:32:58.797]  Call 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
[00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:15.106]  Alright, I'm going to run through a gamut of news as fast as I can.
[00:33:15.146 --> 00:33:21.309]  Then we'll go to Ron, Charles, Moses, Bear in Texas, Ron and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:33.439]  And coming up in the next two hours, we have a two separate very important guests to cover how the entire infrastructure is being handed over to private interest right in front of everyone's face.
[00:33:33.499 --> 00:33:34.599]  And it's not privatization.
[00:33:34.819 --> 00:33:36.420]  It is looting.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.442]  Let me just tell you, this hour is brought to you by the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.
[00:33:40.502 --> 00:33:42.143]  I just love these products.
[00:33:42.183 --> 00:33:50.186]  You know, you can go spend all this money on these new fancy dandy organic soaps that are made out of citrus and out of vegetables.
[00:33:50.914 --> 00:33:55.098]  And that's what they were doing in 1947, so 59 years.
[00:33:55.778 --> 00:33:57.620]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:05.487]  I mean, real hard to find, all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, chlorides, glycerins, lanolins, vitamins, or antibacterials?
[00:34:05.527 --> 00:34:06.568]  Probably never, right?
[00:34:06.908 --> 00:34:12.012]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company for the past 57 years, and that's in their ad copy, it's now 59.
[00:34:12.973 --> 00:34:13.374]  We're good to go!
[00:34:30.908 --> 00:34:33.511]  For good old-fashioned pure soap call 1-800-340-7091.
[00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:37.775]  They've got free catalogs.
[00:34:38.055 --> 00:34:49.606]  They've also got little deals where starter packs where you get shampoo, bar soap, dishwashing soap, and a little bundle for basically the price of you know one bottle of toxic soap you buy at the store.
[00:34:49.986 --> 00:34:52.789]  You see normally organic soap is much more expensive than the toxic
[00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:59.777]  Corrosive detergent based soaps with the lauryl sulfate and the rest of it with all the health problems associated.
[00:34:59.817 --> 00:35:11.590]  Now with Calbin Pure Soap, you get it much less expensive than the Toxic Soap and a lot less expensive than the expensive Organic Soap because they were organic before people even called it organic back in 1947-59 years ago.
[00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:17.792]  Save up to 85% off supermarket and retail store prices.
[00:35:17.832 --> 00:35:20.254]  Call today for a Calbin Pure Soap catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:35:20.374 --> 00:35:28.900]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or on the web at CalbinPureSoap.com.
[00:35:29.221 --> 00:35:34.865]  C-A-L-B-E-N PureSoap.com or there on the left hand side of InfoWars.com.
[00:35:34.885 --> 00:35:40.809]  There's a banner that links directly over to them and once you try Pure Soap once, I guarantee you, you'll never use anything else.
[00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:41.830]  In fact, they just sent us another
[00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:50.097]  I've bought it from them before, before they were sponsors, but they just sent us a whole other big year's supply and I just divvied it up between my staff here and gave it to them.
[00:35:50.117 --> 00:35:52.559]  The extra thing is we've already got a bunch of it at home.
[00:35:52.839 --> 00:35:54.581]  And they've got month's supplies, year's supplies.
[00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:56.062]  It's so inexpensive.
[00:35:56.642 --> 00:36:01.767]  You know, about 20% of your budget on average is spent, and yes, spilt down the toilet and drain.
[00:36:03.613 --> 00:36:10.796]  All these toxic chemicals that you buy at the store, 20% of your grocery bill, this is a fraction of this.
[00:36:10.936 --> 00:36:14.177]  On average, this is 85% less than that.
[00:36:14.898 --> 00:36:18.439]  So 1-800-340-7091 or calbinpierso.com.
[00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:19.840]  Be sure and check that out.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:25.462]  And then very quickly, let me just say that if you want to see our powerful documentary film productions,
[00:36:26.337 --> 00:36:28.178]  You also fund us by purchasing them.
[00:36:28.258 --> 00:36:33.980]  That's how we can let hundreds of thousands of people go download video off of our servers, which is thousands of dollars, folks.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:43.684]  It will cost me thousands of dollars, in bandwidth, even buying it in huge bulk pricing, to be able to put out this free Cheney Report, because it's so popular already.
[00:36:45.325 --> 00:36:47.766]  We don't just have the government attacking, and trying to shut it down.
[00:36:47.826 --> 00:36:49.226]  We have people hitting it en masse.
[00:36:49.286 --> 00:36:50.827]  We have it on three different servers right now.
[00:36:51.664 --> 00:36:58.625]  This is how you support us is by buying the DVDs, and the VHS's, and the t-shirts, and the bumper stickers, and the books, and the books on tape that we offer.
[00:36:58.865 --> 00:37:02.366]  It's not just my 14 films, and my book, and Paul Watson's book that we offer.
[00:37:02.766 --> 00:37:09.887]  We also offer our t-shirts that are pro-gun, pro-America, anti-New World Order, a whole bunch of different ones for men and women.
[00:37:10.287 --> 00:37:11.307]  Made in America, by the way.
[00:37:11.327 --> 00:37:13.008]  It costs a lot more for us to do that, but we do it.
[00:37:13.848 --> 00:37:17.669]  And we also have PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:37:17.849 --> 00:37:19.669]  All of my films, my Whitney TV reports,
[00:37:20.837 --> 00:37:27.945]  The video reports of live interviews here in studio, my book, Paul Watson's book, all my best audio interviews.
[00:37:28.085 --> 00:37:28.806]  It's ridiculous.
[00:37:28.846 --> 00:37:29.967]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:30.949 --> 00:37:31.930]  There's so much there!
[00:37:33.706 --> 00:37:37.268]  15 cents a day for your exclusive membership, monthly and yearly memberships.
[00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:40.689]  A yearly membership, you get three months free when you sign up for a year.
[00:37:40.709 --> 00:37:42.810]  Or go get a $5.95 monthly membership.
[00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:49.012]  I mean, you spend $5.95 in two or three days on coffee for coffee drinkers out there, you know, who go buy at Starbucks.
[00:37:49.492 --> 00:37:53.434]  This is a great deal and it funds us and it makes what we're doing possible.
[00:37:54.914 --> 00:37:56.175]  And I want to expand what we're doing.
[00:37:56.215 --> 00:37:58.095]  I want to increase our attack on the New World Order.
[00:37:58.155 --> 00:37:59.456]  I want to be able to expose them.
[00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:00.436]  I want to be able to fight them.
[00:38:00.496 --> 00:38:02.477]  I know it's effective, but we need your support.
[00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:14.088]  So again, InfoWars.com to go order off the Secure Online Shopping Cart, hard copies of the documentaries and films that we carry, and books.
[00:38:14.308 --> 00:38:17.789]  We're carrying a lot of other new books and videos by other wonderful researchers.
[00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.391]  It's all up on InfoWars.com to get a hard copy.
[00:38:20.491 --> 00:38:24.153]  Loose Change 2 by Dylan Avery, a great 9-11 film.
[00:38:24.273 --> 00:38:25.694]  His second edition is just excellent.
[00:38:26.454 --> 00:38:31.757]  It's all up there on InfoWars.com or go to PrisonPlanet.tv to see it online right now.
[00:38:33.166 --> 00:38:36.428]  Let's take a few calls so I can settle down a little bit.
[00:38:37.528 --> 00:38:52.795]  Because when I start working 18 hours a day again, like I did yesterday, I tend to get even more fired up and more aggressive in battling the New World Order, and I tend to skip over a lot of information we need to cover.
[00:38:53.976 --> 00:38:56.237]  But before we do go to your calls, let me just say this.
[00:38:57.578 --> 00:39:00.159]  We have reenacted scientifically
[00:39:01.343 --> 00:39:08.318]  The official story of how Dick Cheney shot Mr. Whittington last Saturday.
[00:39:08.952 --> 00:39:14.334]  Obviously he covered it up for 22 hours, didn't let the police in for 13 plus hours.
[00:39:14.794 --> 00:39:17.815]  We know that he had a shooting between 15 and 18 feet.
[00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:23.396]  Not from our scientific test you can watch a video of right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:23.796 --> 00:39:27.617]  We know that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:39:28.017 --> 00:39:31.518]  And we know that last night the server that it was on was attacked.
[00:39:31.538 --> 00:39:34.339]  Somebody went in and wiped the servers with a wipe command.
[00:39:34.759 --> 00:39:36.200]  Very sophisticated attack.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.360]  It is an official hack.
[00:39:38.394 --> 00:39:44.478]  And so we've got it up there on different servers right now and I have no doubt they'll be attacking again.
[00:39:44.658 --> 00:39:45.538]  Go download it.
[00:39:46.019 --> 00:39:47.759]  Put it on your server.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.960]  Put it on the BitTorrent.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.081]  Put it out there on other people's servers.
[00:39:52.422 --> 00:39:52.902]  Share it.
[00:39:53.283 --> 00:39:54.623]  Get it out there now.
[00:39:55.164 --> 00:39:57.185]  Don't just hyperlink over to it.
[00:39:57.245 --> 00:40:02.508]  We need you to get it so that the cat is out of the bag and then they'll move on.
[00:40:03.974 --> 00:40:09.570]  I mean, they were waiting yesterday because I promoted it big time on air that it would be going up around 6 o'clock at night.
[00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:10.172]  Of course, it took...
[00:40:11.448 --> 00:40:16.712]  About five and a half hours, longer than that, with us in here to get the 10-minute report up.
[00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:19.794]  We had three different cameras, about an hour shot on each camera.
[00:40:19.814 --> 00:40:29.441]  We had to put it all together, put the documents, the photos in, the forensics reports, the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife report, the medical reports, all of it.
[00:40:29.481 --> 00:40:37.647]  I mean, this is a professional TV production that could even air on Discovery Channel that Ryan Slickheisen threw together yesterday after getting up, you know, at 6 a.m.
[00:40:37.667 --> 00:40:39.368]  to meet us here at the office and go in and
[00:40:39.868 --> 00:41:03.130]  uh... videotape uh... and help us conduct the experiment so I commend him and it needs to be seen it deserves to be seen but frankly it's already getting so big that even if they don't go in and try to wipe our servers again uh... because they've got a backwards everything folks that it is important that that you get it and syndicate it because they cannot attack hundreds of sites that have it so again
[00:41:03.783 --> 00:41:05.626]  Help us get it out now!
[00:41:05.786 --> 00:41:17.603]  Go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, link through, grab it, and host it on other servers, get it out there on the big file sharing networks, and this is a big story!
[00:41:17.643 --> 00:41:18.564]  Explain to people!
[00:41:19.546 --> 00:41:20.107]  The media
[00:41:22.248 --> 00:41:25.889]  The mainstream controlled press has turned this into a big political distraction.
[00:41:25.909 --> 00:41:27.910]  They're attacking Cheney for all the wrong reasons.
[00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:35.653]  Al Franken and the rest of them are not going after Cheney on the cover-up, on blocking the police.
[00:41:35.733 --> 00:41:38.374]  I'm saying he wasn't drinking and now saying, oh, just one beer.
[00:41:38.674 --> 00:41:40.454]  Yeah, just like the DWI guy.
[00:41:40.514 --> 00:41:41.635]  I just said, one beer, officer.
[00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:46.556]  And it turns out he's got a blood alcohol level of 1.8 and he's been drinking Jack Daniels.
[00:41:47.557 --> 00:41:48.417]  This is classic.
[00:41:49.157 --> 00:41:50.838]  We said day one back on Monday.
[00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:53.361]  Hey, especially in Texas.
[00:41:53.842 --> 00:41:56.746]  Most people who hunt drink.
[00:41:56.906 --> 00:41:57.446]  I don't do it.
[00:41:57.527 --> 00:41:58.728]  I won't do it with people that do.
[00:41:59.889 --> 00:42:03.073]  But I can guarantee you folks, it is heavy drinking.
[00:42:03.814 --> 00:42:09.061]  In most cases, duck hunting, grouse hunting, pheasant hunting, quail hunting, dove hunting.
[00:42:10.141 --> 00:42:11.762]  And it is a bad recipe.
[00:42:12.183 --> 00:42:27.234]  And there are major news articles out now admitting, of course, five days later with medical doctors saying, oh yeah, if somebody drops a gun or falls over and shoots somebody before 11am, it's usually an accident.
[00:42:27.254 --> 00:42:28.435]  But we see most of the accidents
[00:42:29.315 --> 00:42:33.477]  After noon, and it's almost always alcohol-related.
[00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:36.397]  But Tucker Carlson got up a few nights ago and said it's ridiculous.
[00:42:36.477 --> 00:42:37.558]  No one drinks when they hunt.
[00:42:37.838 --> 00:42:38.758]  It's never been heard of.
[00:42:38.798 --> 00:42:39.438]  It's not going on.
[00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:41.859]  And we say it looks like drinking, but we don't want to speculate.
[00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:45.240]  We focused in on the ballistics as soon as we knew that he'd been hit in the heart.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.181]  And then it had gone through all the layers of clothing.
[00:42:47.737 --> 00:42:56.321]  When we were shooting watermelon, a Cornish game hen, smaller chicken, paper targets, we were testing the spread and penetration.
[00:42:56.561 --> 00:43:02.144]  We did multiple tests, about 8 different tests while we were out there, from different distances.
[00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:04.665]  Most of the tests were from the 30 yards, i.e.
[00:43:04.685 --> 00:43:06.766]  90 feet, translated, converted.
[00:43:07.874 --> 00:43:14.403]  And we knew that he was shotting, I said around 15 feet, just from my knowledge of shotguns.
[00:43:14.664 --> 00:43:16.326]  Turns out 15 to 18 feet.
[00:43:16.426 --> 00:43:25.438]  There between 15 and 18 feet, depending on which test we did, when shot from 90 yards, it just didn't even penetrate a millimeter.
[00:43:26.906 --> 00:43:28.807]  So understand, he shot him up close.
[00:43:28.847 --> 00:43:31.709]  That proves the whole story is a fraud and a lie.
[00:43:31.749 --> 00:43:34.490]  This is a smoking gun and that's why they're afraid of it.
[00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:35.871]  And it's being ignored.
[00:43:35.951 --> 00:43:40.694]  Can the alternative media force it out and force the mainstream news to report on it?
[00:43:41.194 --> 00:43:48.058]  Because if we can bring Cheney down for lying on this, that could stop the Iran invasion or back it off.
[00:43:48.839 --> 00:43:50.940]  Seriously, this is how this works in history.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.542]  Small things can bring down tyrants.
[00:43:53.662 --> 00:43:56.764]  Obviously the new older controllers will still just keep moving forward.
[00:43:57.105 --> 00:44:01.128]  Now there's talk of trying to kick him out and move in Condi Rice, another puppet.
[00:44:01.448 --> 00:44:09.374]  The point is it will damage this neocon, anti-American, big government, gun-grabbing, war-mongering system.
[00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:15.407]  So it's up on InfoWars.com right now for you semi-computer savvy folks.
[00:44:15.427 --> 00:44:24.229]  I mean, I'm not very computer savvy, but I know how to go download stuff and post it on servers and newsgroups and BitTorrent and file sharing networks.
[00:44:24.409 --> 00:44:26.029]  Go get it right now.
[00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:27.850]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:37.732]  If you get home from work today and the site's gone down again, either from massive traffic or another hack, wait until it goes right back up again or find it somewhere else and distribute it.
[00:44:38.499 --> 00:44:39.960]  It is so important.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:45.343]  You know, I hardly ever get on here and rant and rave about a story we've done, even though most of them are very, very important.
[00:44:46.503 --> 00:44:46.864]  Okay.
[00:44:48.144 --> 00:44:49.985]  Let's move very quickly through your calls.
[00:44:50.045 --> 00:44:52.327]  We've got guests coming up and a lot of other news I've got to cover.
[00:44:52.707 --> 00:44:55.809]  And there's so much here that we need to go over.
[00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:57.209]  But let's go to Ron in Nevada.
[00:44:57.229 --> 00:44:57.890]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:58.230]  Welcome.
[00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:00.051]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:45:00.391 --> 00:45:00.691]  Hi.
[00:45:01.272 --> 00:45:05.554]  I wanted to call you about the training shooting.
[00:45:06.058 --> 00:45:12.780]  But I was wondering if there's a restriction on the Texas hunting license on Sunset.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.581]  I know some hunting licenses have a restriction.
[00:45:16.761 --> 00:45:18.261]  Yeah, 530 isn't Sunset here now.
[00:45:19.061 --> 00:45:22.722]  Yeah, but is there a restriction on the hunting license though?
[00:45:23.662 --> 00:45:27.183]  Yes, you can't hunt quail after dark.
[00:45:28.103 --> 00:45:28.683]  Ah, okay.
[00:45:28.983 --> 00:45:32.164]  Do you know what time that he actually shot Wellington?
[00:45:32.704 --> 00:45:34.625]  Well, I mean they lie so much, but they're saying around 530.
[00:45:36.638 --> 00:45:39.820]  Uh, so they did reduce it back to the, uh, sunset time.
[00:45:41.361 --> 00:45:45.202]  Well, I mean, I doubt, I mean, I doubt they were hunting in the dark anyways, because you can't hunt birds when it's dark.
[00:45:46.083 --> 00:45:50.185]  Yeah, but, uh, if you have a couple of beers or something, you know, who knows, you know.
[00:45:50.985 --> 00:45:51.605]  You know what I'm saying?
[00:45:51.786 --> 00:45:56.768]  I know, but, I mean, it's just, I mean, it's an interesting point, but just why speculate when we know he shot him up close?
[00:45:57.008 --> 00:45:58.109]  We know the whole story's a lie.
[00:45:59.129 --> 00:45:59.469]  Yeah, I know.
[00:45:59.489 --> 00:46:00.470]  And they lied about everything else.
[00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.272]  They lied about, uh, you know, how bad off he was hurt when they knew from the time he got the x-ray.
[00:46:05.828 --> 00:46:07.688]  I mean, it's been nothing but lying.
[00:46:07.708 --> 00:46:11.589]  Alright, did they use lead shot or steel shot?
[00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:12.910]  Did you know that by chance?
[00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.990]  The ballistics really aren't any different and we don't know.
[00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:23.312]  But normally 7.5 is not coded because it's such a small BB to begin with.
[00:46:25.172 --> 00:46:26.373]  It's lead not coded?
[00:46:26.433 --> 00:46:27.273]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:46:28.453 --> 00:46:32.934]  I just said, sir, I don't know the specifics of the component of the shot.
[00:46:33.908 --> 00:46:39.152]  Yeah, because if you have a lead pellet near your heart, I imagine you've got more problems than just the pellet itself.
[00:46:39.432 --> 00:46:39.873]  I hear you.
[00:46:39.893 --> 00:46:41.014]  I appreciate the call, Ron.
[00:46:41.414 --> 00:46:42.535]  Charles in Louisiana.
[00:46:42.575 --> 00:46:43.496]  Charles, you're on the air.
[00:46:43.536 --> 00:46:43.856]  Welcome.
[00:46:44.476 --> 00:46:44.757]  Hello?
[00:46:45.097 --> 00:46:45.417]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:45.757 --> 00:46:46.218]  Yeah.
[00:46:46.238 --> 00:46:47.659]  Mr. Jones, I just wanted to get your opinion.
[00:46:47.699 --> 00:46:50.001]  What do you think is going on in Louisiana now?
[00:46:50.021 --> 00:46:50.801]  What are they trying to do?
[00:46:50.861 --> 00:46:51.962]  Just break the state off?
[00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.203]  Want everybody out?
[00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:55.045]  What we predicted they would do, they're doing.
[00:46:55.185 --> 00:47:02.931]  They are openly going to take most of the property and do it into big developments and build a bunch of hotels and casinos that elites are giving first dibs on controlling.
[00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:13.994]  Another big sweetheart deal and they're using it to turn into a whole federal zone and they're going to give the major port there to the United Arab Emirates?
[00:47:14.054 --> 00:47:16.215]  I'm a longshoreman all my life.
[00:47:16.235 --> 00:47:18.816]  So you're going to be working for the Arabs?
[00:47:19.376 --> 00:47:19.736]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:20.276 --> 00:47:21.516]  Well, I'm retired now.
[00:47:21.856 --> 00:47:25.998]  But anyway, you know the electricity companies here, if they want your house now, they'll just send you a $1,400 bill.
[00:47:27.939 --> 00:47:30.861]  Well, I agree.
[00:47:30.901 --> 00:47:32.503]  That shows the corruption.
[00:47:32.643 --> 00:47:34.824]  You know, in the past, I never had to dispute water bills.
[00:47:34.845 --> 00:47:36.226]  I never had to dispute power bills.
[00:47:36.686 --> 00:47:40.669]  They'll send me a power bill for sometimes, you know, $1,400.
[00:47:40.889 --> 00:47:42.270]  $1,400, $1,500 is what I've seen.
[00:47:42.751 --> 00:47:49.116]  And it can even be, when I've been out of town for a week and everything's turned off, and you know, the month before, in the middle of the summer, it was $800, and now it's $1,400, or it's $300, and now it's $1,000.
[00:47:52.538 --> 00:47:56.621]  And you'll call up and they'll admit it's a mistake, or, oh, you got a $2,000 water bill.
[00:47:56.661 --> 00:47:58.202]  And we're like, there's no broken water here.
[00:47:58.222 --> 00:47:59.103]  It's not a mistake, kid.
[00:47:59.143 --> 00:47:59.983]  It's not a mistake.
[00:48:00.464 --> 00:48:01.805]  They're paying three times as much.
[00:48:01.865 --> 00:48:07.568]  So I have the phone company all the time cheating me, and then I call up and have to sit on the phone, and they admit, oh, it's a mistake.
[00:48:07.629 --> 00:48:08.229]  It's a racket.
[00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:09.870]  It's not a mistake.
[00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.052]  See, a $1,400 bill is going from $300.
[00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:14.273]  Yeah, everything's going criminal.
[00:48:14.413 --> 00:48:15.714]  Everything's robbing and cheating.
[00:48:15.834 --> 00:48:19.777]  And another thing is, now, all the police are going to be leaving because they ain't got no housing.
[00:48:20.322 --> 00:48:22.023]  Uh, they got the, you know, the cruise ships.
[00:48:22.043 --> 00:48:23.304]  They're going to be putting them out.
[00:48:23.784 --> 00:48:24.924]  And they don't have no trailers.
[00:48:25.485 --> 00:48:28.326]  Last week, the sheriff had to go steal trailers for some residents.
[00:48:28.946 --> 00:48:32.628]  The sheriff... But there are tens of thousands of trailers in Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:48:33.669 --> 00:48:35.189]  Brand new trailers just sitting out there.
[00:48:35.529 --> 00:48:37.130]  Sixteen thousand all together.
[00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.650]  More than that.
[00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:38.651]  You're talking about Oklahoma.
[00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:39.171]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:43.293]  Well, you know, what's got me is, our state's gone.
[00:48:43.653 --> 00:48:44.914]  They took our state over.
[00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:51.334]  And I don't think that people's going to be living on the outskirts with the bills going on right now, $1,400 bills.
[00:48:51.694 --> 00:48:55.897]  I don't know what's going to happen, but people's going to have to have contempt for these politicians.
[00:48:56.317 --> 00:49:00.680]  They're going to have to wake up and fight, or they're going to be in the street like a lot of people are in the street right now.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.822]  Crime rate's so bad up here right now, people don't know what to do.
[00:49:04.643 --> 00:49:06.584]  People just, they're confused.
[00:49:06.904 --> 00:49:14.189]  But every state, this could happen to any state at any time, and people's got to wake up here and quit griping about it and do something about it.
[00:49:14.713 --> 00:49:20.615]  Have contempt, call them politicians and show your contempt, show your fury, because I'm just sick of it.
[00:49:20.655 --> 00:49:28.379]  Well, I think more than that, the politicians know we're angry at them, that's why they're building more emergency command bunkers and militarizing more police against us.
[00:49:29.019 --> 00:49:31.480]  I mean, they're moving forward in a big, big way.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:38.063]  The key is calling into other talk radio shows, starting your own organizations, getting aggressive and waking up the rest of the sheep.
[00:49:39.043 --> 00:49:42.466]  Because you're awake there, Charles, but a lot of people aren't awake.
[00:49:42.606 --> 00:49:44.787]  Well, a lot of people are here because of your tapes.
[00:49:44.907 --> 00:49:47.829]  I mean, my parish, everybody knows what's going on.
[00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.251]  We don't even have... We ran FEMA out of here.
[00:49:51.052 --> 00:49:52.833]  Because of them tapes, we ran FEMA.
[00:49:52.873 --> 00:49:53.854]  We wouldn't take FEMA.
[00:49:54.494 --> 00:49:54.874]  Oh, really?
[00:49:54.915 --> 00:49:58.377]  So over the years, I've talked to you before, you've handed out thousands of videos and that had an effect?
[00:49:58.617 --> 00:49:58.857]  Yes.
[00:49:58.977 --> 00:49:59.198]  Oh, yes.
[00:49:59.238 --> 00:50:01.079]  I know some parishes did run them out physically.
[00:50:01.659 --> 00:50:02.400]  We told them no.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.643]  I even got the president of the council up here on a radio show.
[00:50:07.364 --> 00:50:12.330]  And we ran FEMA out, but FEMA's taking over the motels.
[00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:13.651]  They won't even leave the motels.
[00:50:14.452 --> 00:50:16.535]  The motels and bathrooms are trashed.
[00:50:16.935 --> 00:50:19.078]  And they were supposed to leave, and they tell them they ain't leaving.
[00:50:19.098 --> 00:50:20.700]  The police won't do nothing about it.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.144]  The small motel owners are just so frustrated.
[00:50:24.164 --> 00:50:25.145]  They're not making no money.
[00:50:25.828 --> 00:50:27.189]  I mean, I'm telling you the truth.
[00:50:27.289 --> 00:50:28.190]  It's confusion.
[00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:29.791]  Nothing but confusion up here.
[00:50:30.032 --> 00:50:30.932]  And it's due to FEMA.
[00:50:31.233 --> 00:50:32.213]  FEMA caused all this.
[00:50:32.554 --> 00:50:33.234]  Well, don't worry.
[00:50:33.254 --> 00:50:38.038]  If Al-Qaeda attacks us, the government will do a good job confiscating your guns.
[00:50:38.439 --> 00:50:40.620]  First thing they do is not allow food or water to come in.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.303]  We just gotta go to the neighborhoods and take your guns.
[00:50:46.118 --> 00:50:47.399]  Charles, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:47.459 --> 00:50:48.699]  I understand your frustration.
[00:50:48.819 --> 00:50:50.080]  Well, I really can't understand it.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.661]  I'm out of Louisiana, but I empathize with you and I appreciate the call.
[00:50:53.221 --> 00:50:56.283]  Moses, Bayer, Ron, others, your calls are straight ahead.

[00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:15.351]  That's what they are.
[00:54:16.231 --> 00:54:19.812]  With a bunch of fancy PR teams robbing the living daylights out of us.
[00:54:21.432 --> 00:54:23.453]  And all their power and all their control is never enough.
[00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:25.254]  They want more, more, more, more, more.
[00:54:27.074 --> 00:54:28.435]  And it's all going to be for terrorism.
[00:54:28.455 --> 00:54:31.475]  They're going to have to take your property and your pension funds to fight the terrorists.
[00:54:32.036 --> 00:54:33.156]  They're going to have to...
[00:54:33.917 --> 00:54:35.977]  Tax living daylights out of you to fight the terrorist.
[00:54:35.997 --> 00:54:39.978]  They're going to have to take your guns away from you to fight the terrorist.
[00:54:40.938 --> 00:54:44.659]  They just have to rule over you and have a tyranny and be in total control.
[00:54:45.139 --> 00:54:46.459]  Not because they want power.
[00:54:46.599 --> 00:54:47.479]  No, they hate it.
[00:54:48.159 --> 00:54:49.860]  It's because they want to keep you safe.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:50.820]  They care about you.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.300]  Alright, Moses just hung up.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.181]  Let's go to Bear in Texas.
[00:54:55.221 --> 00:54:56.041]  Bear, you're on the air.
[00:54:56.061 --> 00:54:57.861]  Hello, Alex.
[00:54:58.201 --> 00:55:00.902]  I have something that's probably going to upset you even more.
[00:55:04.514 --> 00:55:13.041]  On Tuesday, February 14th, a man, a kind, gentle-hearted man, was going out to take, uh, this is in North Austin, where these, um, homeless people live.
[00:55:13.081 --> 00:55:16.163]  He was taking out toilet paper and water and ice and clothing to them.
[00:55:16.844 --> 00:55:17.785]  He had his dog with him.
[00:55:18.425 --> 00:55:31.896]  His dog was walking ahead of him, and he saw a pair of black pants and a brush, and suddenly a shot rang out, and it was a police officer, and he shot his dog, for no reason, other than to intimidate the people out there.
[00:55:32.984 --> 00:55:34.065]  Then they arrested the man.
[00:55:34.325 --> 00:55:36.867]  They cited him for having a dog off of a leash.
[00:55:37.028 --> 00:55:38.489]  They said that they may stop it.
[00:55:38.609 --> 00:55:39.630]  The dog didn't.
[00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.051]  He rubbed his face all over his dog.
[00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:49.078]  Well, the Austin SWAT team is already glorified on national television with their little TV show, Texas SWAT, and they're a big part of it.
[00:55:50.356 --> 00:55:51.117]  I've been to the houses.
[00:55:51.137 --> 00:55:51.637]  This is murder.
[00:55:51.697 --> 00:55:52.317]  It's murder.
[00:55:52.358 --> 00:55:54.039]  And we're doing something about it.
[00:55:55.199 --> 00:56:03.705]  I've been to the houses where they just go in and automatically, chihuahua, pit bull, doesn't matter, they shoot it, quote, because the dog causes a disturbance.
[00:56:03.765 --> 00:56:05.827]  So if they come in your house, your dog's dead.
[00:56:07.588 --> 00:56:08.229]  In open.
[00:56:08.489 --> 00:56:09.009]  I understand.
[00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:12.672]  And it was a small black dog.
[00:56:13.152 --> 00:56:14.013]  Everybody knew the dog.
[00:56:14.053 --> 00:56:15.554]  It was friendly and kind and loving.
[00:56:16.194 --> 00:56:17.155]  This dog showed no
[00:56:18.317 --> 00:56:20.518]  No action towards the officer, and he shot it.
[00:56:21.098 --> 00:56:22.178]  And they're trying to cover it up.
[00:56:22.198 --> 00:56:26.279]  They're trying to say that the dog was being menacing towards them.
[00:56:26.379 --> 00:56:28.180]  It's just more of this tyranny.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.040]  So somebody's hiding in the bushes.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.101]  I'm not familiar with the case.
[00:56:33.561 --> 00:56:34.161]  Has it been in the news?
[00:56:34.181 --> 00:56:35.041]  It just happened on Tuesday.
[00:56:35.061 --> 00:56:37.662]  No, of course it hasn't been in the news.
[00:56:37.682 --> 00:56:38.702]  It just happened Tuesday.
[00:56:38.742 --> 00:56:40.863]  They don't talk about things like this on the mainstream news.
[00:56:41.323 --> 00:56:44.744]  They don't tell about dogs being murdered by police officers.
[00:56:45.818 --> 00:56:47.299]  It's been in the news a few times.
[00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:52.080]  And so the dog barked at somebody in the woods, so they shot the dog.
[00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:53.221]  He didn't even bark.
[00:56:53.721 --> 00:56:56.162]  He made no movement towards him.
[00:56:56.602 --> 00:56:58.163]  He was just simply walking down the trail.
[00:56:58.223 --> 00:56:59.723]  Well, I'll have to check it out.
[00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:00.824]  I don't know the particulars.
[00:57:01.484 --> 00:57:03.125]  We emailed you.
[00:57:03.725 --> 00:57:05.085]  We just sent you an email about this.
[00:57:05.846 --> 00:57:06.826]  We want this to get out.
[00:57:06.846 --> 00:57:09.607]  We want people to see that they're trying to intimidate the people.
[00:57:10.123 --> 00:57:10.543]  I hear you.
[00:57:10.563 --> 00:57:11.604]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[00:57:11.984 --> 00:57:12.484]  I appreciate it.
[00:57:12.504 --> 00:57:13.625]  I'll have to check it out.
[00:57:13.645 --> 00:57:23.870]  You know, you called in with a name called Quiet Bear or something, so then when somebody calls in with that, I'm kind of like, okay, is this a serious phone call or, you know, what's going on?
[00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:27.252]  I have no doubt that they didn't, you know, that they shot the dog.
[00:57:27.272 --> 00:57:31.094]  Remember the footage in Tennessee of the lab running up, wagging its tail?
[00:57:32.245 --> 00:57:45.771]  Universal hey I'm your friend I want to be petted and then the cop doesn't know Yellow Lab is the sweetest creature on earth and shoots it a whole bunch of times as the family screams and cries just because they opened the car and the dog jumped out and was wagging its tail sniffing the ground.
[00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:48.812]  Oh my gosh that dog just jumped out of the car!
[00:57:48.892 --> 00:57:56.976]  You know it's like my boss in terror you leave the door open it goes running out the front door trying to lick and kiss whoever's out there and you know is it going to be gunned down?
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.081]  I don't know, but thank you for the call, sir.
[00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:03.682]  Send me some information on it, and I'll check it out.
[00:58:03.702 --> 00:58:08.644]  I don't know what email address you sent it to, tipsandinfowars.com or ryanandinfowars.com.
[00:58:09.024 --> 00:58:15.366]  Those are good places to send it, but if it's just an email saying this happened... The problem is my phones ring off the hook.
[00:58:15.406 --> 00:58:16.206]  It's very frustrating.
[00:58:16.446 --> 00:58:17.667]  The government's taken my children.
[00:58:17.687 --> 00:58:18.827]  The government's taken my ranch.
[00:58:18.847 --> 00:58:20.008]  The government's taken my business.
[00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:21.448]  The government shot my dog.
[00:58:22.449 --> 00:58:23.509]  Hundreds of phone calls a day.
[00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:28.557]  Pouring in hundreds of emails, really thousands of emails, hundreds of faxes.
[00:58:29.017 --> 00:58:30.958]  And everybody's like, can't you answer my question?
[00:58:30.978 --> 00:58:31.799]  Can't you help me?
[00:58:32.059 --> 00:58:33.260]  Come out and do a report!
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:38.003]  There's not enough hours in the day to deal with the sickness of this country.
[00:58:41.526 --> 00:58:45.428]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.769 --> 00:58:46.629]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.612 --> 00:58:58.253]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.913 --> 00:58:59.974]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.675 --> 00:59:01.796]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.436 --> 00:59:03.257]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.018 --> 00:59:05.919]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.939 --> 00:59:09.282]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.762 --> 00:59:13.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.106 --> 00:59:17.228]  Something very curious is happening.
[00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:22.993]  We went and did a forensic test of the Cheney shooting at the
[00:59:24.176 --> 00:59:26.798]  Hill Country Rifle Range, outside Austin, Texas.
[00:59:28.659 --> 00:59:39.125]  Recreating their own police report, claiming that he shot Mr. Whittington at, well, 90 feet or 30 yards.
[00:59:39.325 --> 00:59:41.126]  And we did a video report, put it up last night.
[00:59:42.047 --> 00:59:47.570]  Someone went in, this isn't servers crashing, someone went in and wiped the entire
[00:59:48.746 --> 01:00:02.031]  Alright, well what we call our free media server, where we put the free videos, wiped it, so today we put it up on several other servers, and then right as I was talking about it on there, someone went in, and again, I have experienced smart IT people.
[01:00:05.213 --> 01:00:06.273]  This is clearly happening.
[01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:08.014]  Someone goes in and wipes it.
[01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:13.063]  Now off of multiple servers, so we upload it again, and it's another listing right now.
[01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:13.784]  It's real funny.
[01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:18.390]  I know, you think you got a big house and a big car, and you're doing real good because you're selling America out.
[01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:20.993]  It's probably even foreign contractors doing it right now.
[01:00:21.553 --> 01:00:22.795]  It's all real cute.
[01:00:22.815 --> 01:00:23.716]  It's all real funny.
[01:00:24.036 --> 01:00:28.602]  You've just ensured that I'm going to make sure that I never shut up about this story now.
[01:00:29.202 --> 01:00:33.046]  About Dick Cheney from the forensics evidence shooting Mr. Whittington up close.
[01:00:33.506 --> 01:00:35.147]  This has got him scared right now.
[01:00:35.408 --> 01:00:36.709]  The police should have done this.
[01:00:37.249 --> 01:00:38.590]  The media should be doing this.
[01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:40.432]  It's fallen to us to do it.
[01:00:41.393 --> 01:00:49.019]  And we've got the spooks right now going in through back doors, very sophisticated, and wiping.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:51.780]  Wiping.
[01:00:52.281 --> 01:01:04.048]  The servers aren't resetting, they're not crashing, they just go in and they erase the medium, which then we have to re-upload off of the backup back on to the server.
[01:01:07.848 --> 01:01:08.909]  Because they're afraid of this.
[01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.550]  And you know what?
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:10.951]  They should be afraid of the truth.
[01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:16.536]  They should be afraid that some of us aren't complete idiots, sucking our thumbs, obsessed with nothing but ball games.
[01:01:17.017 --> 01:01:23.543]  They should be obsessed with the fact that some of us are aware of what they're doing and are going to fight for this country.
[01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:25.585]  And are going to fight the New World Order.
[01:01:26.408 --> 01:01:38.512]  I mean, coming up in about 45 minutes, we're going to break a major news story about the Trans-Texas Toll Roads, that's international by the way, that affects the entire country, and some of the major scams going on there.
[01:01:39.392 --> 01:01:43.774]  So you see, while they're busy attacking us on one front, we're fighting them on another.
[01:01:44.194 --> 01:01:48.275]  And of course, there's hundreds of websites that are huge, that are big supporters of this broadcast.
[01:01:48.295 --> 01:01:49.175]  We can upload it there.
[01:01:49.636 --> 01:01:53.617]  What we'll do is simultaneously do deals with people that we have to, to upload it all over.
[01:01:53.937 --> 01:02:00.680]  As soon as it goes up, you've got to go download it, the report, and duplicate it and syndicate it everywhere.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.780]  As soon as it goes up.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:07.522]  And of course, we're tracking and tracing who's doing this, and they're using proxy servers and jumping around.
[01:02:08.371 --> 01:02:14.955]  And it's just classical New World Order behavior, because this is the freedom of America!
[01:02:15.215 --> 01:02:18.777]  You think they just have fake newspapers in Iraq and then tell us that they're free newspapers?
[01:02:19.037 --> 01:02:23.579]  You think they just spend $1.6 billion for fake newscasts in America in the last few years?
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.200]  Associated Press reported?
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.601]  You think they stopped there?
[01:02:26.741 --> 01:02:27.041]  No!
[01:02:28.022 --> 01:02:32.964]  You see, the Pentagon, it was in the BBC two weeks ago, said we're going to attack websites that disagree with us.
[01:02:33.285 --> 01:02:37.747]  We're going to go in there and plant propaganda in America.
[01:02:39.378 --> 01:02:40.819]  And it's going on right now.
[01:02:40.999 --> 01:02:41.939]  Totally criminal.
[01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.260]  I hope people doing it know it's big-time felonies.
[01:02:45.521 --> 01:02:47.302]  And you're not going to be protected by your bosses.
[01:02:48.082 --> 01:02:58.186]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play a few minutes of this Russell Tice testimony before Congress, before one of the committees.
[01:02:58.446 --> 01:03:00.447]  And Dennis Kucinich, the Congressman, is asking questions.
[01:03:00.487 --> 01:03:08.711]  And he's already made the statements that there are just huge programs all over the place, we're not even hearing about, that spy on us.
[01:03:09.796 --> 01:03:12.577]  But then he keeps saying I can't talk about it because he'll be arrested if he is.
[01:03:12.858 --> 01:03:14.438]  This is the freedom of America.
[01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:25.424]  And specifically it's the government going in and telling people in the NSA and other agencies when they do find evidence of terrorism to leave it alone because these terrorists work for the globalists.
[01:03:27.184 --> 01:03:30.406]  And I hope the people doing this to our websites realize what they're part of.
[01:03:30.786 --> 01:03:31.487]  What they're doing.
[01:03:33.007 --> 01:03:34.328]  I hope they realize that
[01:03:35.638 --> 01:03:38.040]  I mean, you think you're going to be safe with masters like this?
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.782]  You really want to have a criminal state run by criminals?
[01:03:41.042 --> 01:03:42.343]  You really want to aid these people?
[01:03:43.604 --> 01:03:44.745]  You really want to be part of this?
[01:03:44.765 --> 01:03:45.926]  You really think this is good?
[01:03:47.167 --> 01:03:50.190]  You just ensured this story goes big time.
[01:03:54.013 --> 01:03:56.876]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.595 --> 01:03:58.895]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:59.096 --> 01:04:04.837]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:05.097 --> 01:04:10.359]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:14.800]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:18.762]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:23.583]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:04:23.723 --> 01:04:29.985]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.045 --> 01:04:31.906]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:34.446]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[01:04:34.526 --> 01:04:35.707]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:36.427 --> 01:04:39.448]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:40.388 --> 01:04:46.050]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:48.151]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[01:04:48.391 --> 01:04:49.911]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:52.172]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:53.169 --> 01:04:56.432]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.492 --> 01:05:00.675]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.935 --> 01:05:03.718]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.918 --> 01:05:06.300]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:15.147]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.347 --> 01:05:16.688]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:05:16.889 --> 01:05:21.032]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:21.872]  We're good to go!
[01:05:40.382 --> 01:05:44.604]  People who use Cartabite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:05:44.624 --> 01:05:48.385]  For over five years, Cartabite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:05:48.565 --> 01:05:51.747]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartabite.
[01:06:04.443 --> 01:06:07.644]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:13.187]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:06:13.227 --> 01:06:22.851]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:06:22.971 --> 01:06:24.272]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:06:24.312 --> 01:06:29.754]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:06:30.154 --> 01:06:34.695]  If you'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:06:34.775 --> 01:06:36.155]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:06:36.316 --> 01:06:40.677]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:06:40.857 --> 01:06:42.357]  That toll-free number again?
[01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:42.497]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:06:42.537 --> 01:06:44.978]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.238 --> 01:06:47.498]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.638 --> 01:07:15.280]  Well, they're telling American citizens that when they're on airplanes they can't read best-selling books that have the word Jihad in the title, even if it's basically official government propaganda.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.321]  And they tell them, don't ever come on a plane with a book like that again.
[01:07:19.021 --> 01:07:21.782]  It scares the cattle that just bray like a bunch of sheep.
[01:07:22.582 --> 01:07:30.204]  The word Jihad, it's all over, he's reading a book, he's reading a book, now watching the telescreen in front of him built into the back seat of the airplane.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.581]  And we'll get into the new Abu Ghraib information coming out.
[01:07:34.641 --> 01:07:38.202]  It just gets worse and worse, so much with the Iran situation.
[01:07:38.783 --> 01:07:41.764]  Coming up in about 10 minutes or so, we're going to have Sal Castillo.
[01:07:41.784 --> 01:07:42.864]  That's not Sal Castillo.
[01:07:43.864 --> 01:07:48.226]  That's Sal Castillo, the head of the Austin Toll Party, now the Texas Toll Party.
[01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:49.526]  And this is international.
[01:07:49.546 --> 01:07:51.167]  This affects not just America, but the world.
[01:07:51.187 --> 01:07:51.987]  It's going in everywhere.
[01:07:52.327 --> 01:07:53.608]  Same company, same people.
[01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:55.467]  Handing over your roads.
[01:07:55.888 --> 01:07:57.831]  You'll pay thousands and thousands conservatively.
[01:07:57.871 --> 01:07:59.112]  Now it's over $5,000 a year.
[01:07:59.152 --> 01:08:03.398]  They keep ratcheting it up from $3,000 to $4,000 to $5,000 a year to drive on the roads.
[01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.561]  Transponders tracking everything you do.
[01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:06.262]  Taxing you.
[01:08:06.762 --> 01:08:07.884]  Foreign companies running it.
[01:08:08.485 --> 01:08:11.048]  That's all coming up in a few minutes, but I want to air this clip.
[01:08:13.044 --> 01:08:13.865]  This is Congress.
[01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:18.250]  This is a congressional committee with Dennis Kucinich asking questions.
[01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:29.763]  And it's pretty dry because Agent Tice, who worked inside the federal government secret spy operations, is unable to talk because he has a gag on him.
[01:08:30.704 --> 01:08:33.867]  But Kucinich is able to read his past quotes and say so.
[01:08:35.308 --> 01:08:39.670]  Many other huge spying ops going on that are much bigger than what we've heard about and against American citizens.
[01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:41.170]  And he's like, yes, yes.
[01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:43.251]  Well, none of that really is a secret.
[01:08:43.891 --> 01:08:50.894]  It's been all over the news but never gets big national attention that the Pentagon's out watching peace groups, second amendment groups, land rights groups.
[01:08:50.934 --> 01:08:51.775]  I've had them do it to me.
[01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:56.777]  I've been out all over the country and had troops before 9-11 out with video cameras videotaping me with regular army.
[01:08:57.217 --> 01:09:00.218]  And then you try to videotape them and cops run over and go, don't videotape those men.
[01:09:02.178 --> 01:09:03.840]  So this is what we're dealing with.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.462]  This is what we're facing as a nation, as a country.
[01:09:06.482 --> 01:09:16.529]  So we're going to go ahead and roll part of Tice's testimony and it gets really interesting towards the end.
[01:09:16.589 --> 01:09:21.032]  So this is what's really going on with the spying from someone inside of it.
[01:09:21.313 --> 01:09:21.953]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:09:23.274 --> 01:09:31.160]  Mr. Tice, there's been a lot of attention recently focused on a classified NSA program
[01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:39.366]  To eavesdrop on American citizens who call or receive calls from overseas.
[01:09:40.427 --> 01:09:58.595]  A story that ran on January the 12th out of MTV.com described, says President Bush has defended his orders allowing the NSA to eavesdrop on emails and phone conversations from what he described
[01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:05.132]  As a small number of Americans with known ties to Al-Qaeda without obtaining proper warrants.
[01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:18.723]  The President is here saying that this policy of wiretapping without warrants affects a small number of Americans.
[01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:26.610]  Based on your understanding of the
[01:10:27.941 --> 01:10:30.543]  of the program which now is a matter of public record.
[01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:42.232]  Would you say that statement by the President of the United States that it only affects a small number of Americans is true?
[01:10:44.154 --> 01:10:48.397]  Congressman, I can't specifically say how NSA does its work or not.
[01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:50.579]  I could potentially do that in closed session.
[01:10:52.345 --> 01:11:00.149]  Did you say that the number of Americans who might be subject to eavesdropping by the NSA could be in the millions?
[01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:08.353]  I said if a broad brush approach was used in that collection, that it very easily could be in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
[01:11:08.393 --> 01:11:08.753]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:09.774 --> 01:11:13.876]  Although you weren't involved in the NSA program, you stated that you were involved in others.
[01:11:14.216 --> 01:11:16.197]  You also stated that you have grave concerns
[01:11:17.026 --> 01:11:20.668]  About the legitimacy and the legality of these other NSA programs.
[01:11:20.888 --> 01:11:21.509]  Is that correct?
[01:11:21.929 --> 01:11:22.690]  That is correct, sir.
[01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:29.294]  I was involved in what's called Special Access Programs, which are very closely held, that at some point I'd like to talk to Congress about.
[01:11:29.974 --> 01:11:32.656]  Are those considered generally black operations?
[01:11:33.536 --> 01:11:37.859]  We refer to them as black world operations and programs, sir.
[01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:44.703]  Now, we understand that in this particular open setting, Mr. Chairman, that we cannot discuss classified information.
[01:11:45.822 --> 01:11:56.330]  But can you characterize generally how important you believe it is for Congress to know about this program and your particular concerns?
[01:11:57.952 --> 01:12:07.740]  Sir, are you referring to the program that the President has already mentioned or some of the other things that specifically I'd like to talk about?
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.122]  We're talking about either one, but let's get into this.
[01:12:11.222 --> 01:12:14.265]  You know, the President talked about one type of program.
[01:12:15.185 --> 01:12:17.746]  That he maintains is a small-scale program.
[01:12:19.646 --> 01:12:26.327]  Comments have been made by you that suggest that maybe there's a program going on that affects millions of Americans.
[01:12:27.047 --> 01:12:33.089]  So, I guess the question is, we know about one program now.
[01:12:34.509 --> 01:12:44.951]  Is it possible that there's other programs out there that could conceivably be affecting millions of Americans with respect to warrantless wiretaps?
[01:12:47.808 --> 01:13:00.435]  Sorry to go into detail, it would probably put me under water here, but I can say that some of the programs that I worked on, I believe, touched on illegalities and unconstitutional activity.
[01:13:01.976 --> 01:13:17.124]  As far as connecting with the information we know about the program that's been talked about in the press and ultimately confirmed by the President, I can only make a tertiary connection with what ultimately I'd like to talk about to Congress.
[01:13:19.608 --> 01:13:23.970]  Let me ask you, we know that you have approached Congress about this.
[01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:29.232]  You sent a letter to the Intelligence Committee and you made it clear that you wanted to discuss your concerns in a classified setting.
[01:13:29.252 --> 01:13:29.813]  Is that correct?
[01:13:30.113 --> 01:13:30.773]  That's correct, sir.
[01:13:31.153 --> 01:13:35.115]  But the NSA sent a letter blocking you from talking to the Intelligence Committee.
[01:13:35.155 --> 01:13:35.675]  Is that right?
[01:13:36.776 --> 01:13:42.158]  They said that the Intelligence Committees were not cleared at the proper security level for what I wanted to tell them.
[01:13:42.398 --> 01:13:47.481]  So the NSA said no members or staff on the Intelligence Committee are authorized to hear what you have to say.
[01:13:47.821 --> 01:13:48.421]  That's correct, sir.
[01:13:49.868 --> 01:13:51.769]  Did they say members or staff, correct?
[01:13:51.889 --> 01:13:52.449]  That's correct.
[01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:06.575]  It was very shocking to many Americans to know that their government was conducting warrantless wiretaps.
[01:14:09.136 --> 01:14:16.539]  It's even more shocking, more shocking, to see assertions
[01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:32.260]  That eavesdropping by the NSA could be, quote, in the millions if the full range of secret NSA programs is used, unquote.
[01:14:33.061 --> 01:14:45.670]  Is it your belief that it is an urgent matter relating to the protection of the Constitution of the United States
[01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:55.034]  That Congress obtain information to determine the full scope of the eavesdropping going on in this country.
[01:14:57.556 --> 01:14:57.836]  Yes, sir.
[01:14:57.856 --> 01:15:03.279]  As a matter of fact, I have NSA's policy in front of me that basically NSA tells its own people, you will not do this.
[01:15:03.359 --> 01:15:13.324]  Ultimately, quote, the policy of the U.S.S.S., United States Signals Intelligence Service, is to target or collect only foreign communications, unquote.
[01:15:17.386 --> 01:15:25.528]  Do you believe our Constitution is at risk because of widespread wiretapping?
[01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:30.189]  Ultimately, domestically, I have the First Amendment in front of me.
[01:15:30.209 --> 01:15:30.849]  The answer is yes, sir.
[01:15:30.869 --> 01:15:34.570]  Do you have the Fourth Amendment in front of you?
[01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:35.371]  Yes, I do, sir.
[01:15:35.391 --> 01:15:36.071]  Do you want to read it?
[01:15:36.631 --> 01:15:36.811]  Sure.
[01:15:39.163 --> 01:15:57.036]  The right of the people to be secured in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched
[01:16:00.199 --> 01:16:26.444]  You've taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, and am I correct in that it is in that spirit, consistent with the oath that you've taken, that you've approached Congress and asked for an opportunity to meet with members of Congress in a classified session so that you can discuss with them your belief that the Constitution itself is being put at risk with regard to domestic
[01:16:27.285 --> 01:16:27.885]  I don't know.
[01:16:47.382 --> 01:16:48.263]  One final question.
[01:16:48.283 --> 01:17:09.074]  Has the Justice Department contacted you in connection with its investigation of the New York, of the leak, so-called leak of information that has resulted in a hunt for those who are responsible with informing the New York Times of this previously clandestine domestic eavesdropping matter?
[01:17:10.155 --> 01:17:12.816]  About two and a half weeks ago I was approached by the FBI.
[01:17:13.037 --> 01:17:15.378]  They came to my home and they said they wanted to talk to me.
[01:17:16.176 --> 01:17:20.678]  Knowing the witch hunts that's going on right now at NSA, I told them that I prefer not to talk to them.
[01:17:22.419 --> 01:17:44.649]  I think that it's, Mr. Chairman, I think that this is a matter that this committee should reserve the right to continue to review, because not only did the American people not know about the eavesdropping going on, but instead of trying to get into the nature of the eavesdropping, the government is going after people who
[01:17:45.256 --> 01:17:47.297]  Basically, we're defending the Constitution.
[01:17:48.477 --> 01:17:55.040]  This world doesn't have to be upside down, as long as we stand by our obligation to support people like Mr. Tice.
[01:17:55.081 --> 01:17:55.981]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:17:56.001 --> 01:17:57.282]  Thank you, Mr. Tice.
[01:17:58.302 --> 01:17:58.682]  All right.
[01:17:58.802 --> 01:18:03.384]  We're going to go to break, and we're going to come back with Sal Costello, and he heads up the Texas toll party.
[01:18:03.404 --> 01:18:09.087]  We're going to give you the local, up-close view of this takeover and the treachery that's going on.
[01:18:09.587 --> 01:18:10.728]  This isn't toll roads, folks.
[01:18:10.748 --> 01:18:13.529]  This is a takeover of the infrastructure by a foreign Spanish company.
[01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:21.592]  And then coming up in about 45 minutes or less, we're going to have Jack Blood in here dropping a huge bombshell today up on InfoWars.com.
[01:18:22.413 --> 01:18:32.576]  You can go read the details before you even hear it on air of what we've discovered about the tolling company and what's happening here at the state level, just even in the construction.
[01:18:33.394 --> 01:18:38.817]  Uh, and what's gonna happen when they supposedly maintain the roads, they're gonna be ceded, uh, by this imperial system.
[01:18:39.237 --> 01:18:43.460]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net.

[01:19:00.939 --> 01:19:08.807]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.047 --> 01:19:11.669]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with Lay's Med Inc.'

[01:22:59.304 --> 01:23:08.446]  Blasting out on the MNFM dial from upstate New York to Corpus Christi, Texas.
[01:23:09.764 --> 01:23:13.666]  From Kansas City, Missouri to Chicago, Illinois, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:23:14.046 --> 01:23:17.407]  The next two segments were joined in studio by Sal Costello.
[01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:23.970]  A few years ago he got angry to learn they were going to build all these major toll roads right around his southwest Austin neighborhood.
[01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:25.010]  I live in the same area.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:53.087]  There will be four toll roads all around us, and then we're just going to be giving existing, already built, old roads to this foreign Spanish slash Australian company, and transponders in the inspection stickers, tracking everyone, and then we learned how they were getting it through on the politicians, how they were paying off the politicians, the deals were being made, the campaign contributions, and then politicians would say, oh, we're on your side, even though we voted for it, we'll work with you, and then of course stab us in the back, and
[01:23:55.728 --> 01:24:12.159]  This is a nationwide thing, and they'll use the same tactics in your area, but let's talk about Bruce McCracken, the city council member, this Benedict Arnold, this treacherous traitor, and then let's get into the full-page ads you've got in the newspaper and what's happening, and then you've got a lot of news on how this is a nationwide situation.
[01:24:12.359 --> 01:24:13.139]  That's right.
[01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:13.720]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.080]  I also want to thank you for the show.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:15.841]  It's fantastic.
[01:24:16.674 --> 01:24:17.555]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:24:19.176 --> 01:24:22.719]  What we're doing here locally is what folks all over the country have to start doing.
[01:24:22.979 --> 01:24:33.788]  What we're doing is we're taking legal action with lawsuits and we're also taking political action with cutting out some of the cancer that we have in our local governments and even larger than local governments.
[01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:35.389]  And that's kind of what we're focused on.
[01:24:35.409 --> 01:24:38.191]  That's what TexasTollParty.com is focused on.
[01:24:38.632 --> 01:24:43.576]  But yeah, we've got Brewster McCracken who voted to toll roads we've already paid for.
[01:24:44.797 --> 01:24:54.465]  Then he said he's going to work with us and he pushed for an independent review of the tolling of almost all our freeways here in Austin, Texas.
[01:24:55.606 --> 01:25:05.634]  And we found out, then I found out, when I saw the draft of the agreement for this review after many months, that
[01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:13.496]  He basically gave the steering committee for the Independent Review to tollers, the same people who voted to toll roads.
[01:25:13.817 --> 01:25:16.439]  So it's kind of like Enron auditing Enron.
[01:25:16.479 --> 01:25:17.720]  And this is Brewster McCracken.
[01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:31.353]  And now it's even gotten worse because the toller committee has actually approved to let the Freeway Tolling Authority hire a company called URS
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:36.662]  To do these traffic forecasting and we I took a look at URS.
[01:25:37.811 --> 01:25:41.273]  And they have had so many failures.
[01:25:41.593 --> 01:25:50.438]  They've had about a half dozen failures in Florida, where in one case, the first year, they were supposed to make $70 million off this one toll road.
[01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:51.899]  They ended up making $7 million.
[01:25:52.239 --> 01:26:00.544]  So all these toll roads, this is like a scam, where the toll roads get built because of what URS says the traffic's going to be.
[01:26:01.104 --> 01:26:05.967]  And then the whole thing fails, and then the taxpayers pick up the tab.
[01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.348]  This is basically, you know,
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:08.500]  Yeah.
[01:26:09.201 --> 01:26:10.642]  There's also the bond.
[01:26:11.442 --> 01:26:16.246]  There's also a big scam going on there for how these bonds are being rated when private groups buy into this.
[01:26:16.706 --> 01:26:17.687]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:20.369]  This is part of the problem.
[01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:30.456]  Now, here in Texas, some people remember the Camino Columbia toll road that just failed a few years ago, and this particular one was also
[01:26:31.136 --> 01:26:38.478]  The forecast was given by URS where they said the Camino Colombia was going to be 9 million for the first year and it produced only 500,000.
[01:26:39.259 --> 01:26:43.160]  That's about 6% of the forecast.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:49.302]  I mean, anybody else that produces this kind of numbers... I mean, if you or I were working for a company and we failed this many times,
[01:26:50.006 --> 01:26:50.687]  We'd be fired.
[01:26:51.007 --> 01:26:53.429]  But this company is hired because they fluff the numbers.
[01:26:53.449 --> 01:26:55.831]  They're like professional con men.
[01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:59.054]  So it's a rubber stamp company all over the U.S.
[01:26:59.094 --> 01:27:02.697]  that the states and the cities go out and hire to rubber stamp the scam?
[01:27:02.757 --> 01:27:03.838]  That is exactly right.
[01:27:03.858 --> 01:27:09.583]  I mean, this whole thing... The toll roads... First off, these toll roads are not like traditional toll roads.
[01:27:09.863 --> 01:27:15.989]  And like you said, this is about taking our public highways throughout the whole country
[01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:22.102]  And shifting them to toll roads and what they're doing is they're stealing permanently our free express.
[01:27:22.142 --> 01:27:26.565]  Yeah, we're talking about 75 year leases and this is going on all over the place.
[01:27:26.965 --> 01:27:29.006]  They just handed over existing roads in Indiana.
[01:27:29.407 --> 01:27:33.929]  Yeah, these are existing highways that they go in and they use tax dollars to build the roads.
[01:27:34.329 --> 01:27:37.471]  They actually take the right-of-way that we've already paid for decades ago.
[01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:45.636]  They build the road and basically we have to pay and then get tracked and traced and automatically ticketed.
[01:27:46.235 --> 01:27:48.916]  I mean, this is absurd.
[01:27:49.537 --> 01:27:53.199]  And that's why we need to take legal and political action.
[01:27:53.299 --> 01:27:56.741]  Here in Central Texas, in a few months, Brewster McCracken is up.
[01:27:56.801 --> 01:28:00.102]  Hopefully somebody good and viable will run against him.
[01:28:00.463 --> 01:28:01.703]  Maybe you'll run against him, Alex.
[01:28:02.224 --> 01:28:02.904]  Maybe, maybe.
[01:28:03.324 --> 01:28:03.644]  I don't know.
[01:28:03.664 --> 01:28:06.846]  Just when I need more work.
[01:28:06.866 --> 01:28:12.029]  We've got an upcoming political primaries happening just starting Tuesday.
[01:28:12.549 --> 01:28:15.610]  And the exciting part about the primary is very low voter turnout.
[01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:25.132]  We can dump Karen Sunlightner here in Travis County, and Mike Cruzee in Williamson County, who actually pulled in this legislation that steals our land and our property.
[01:28:25.972 --> 01:28:26.852]  Alright, stay with us.
[01:28:26.912 --> 01:28:28.452]  More details when we get back.
[01:28:28.512 --> 01:28:39.095]  And then the big bombshell, once they take over existing roads, they then get paid a ballooned cost to quote, upkeep the roads.
[01:28:39.135 --> 01:28:40.375]  And what do they do once that happens?
[01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:46.710]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:50.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.331 --> 01:28:58.692]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[01:28:59.153 --> 01:29:05.594]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:08.230]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:14.672]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[01:29:15.232 --> 01:29:34.558]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversy surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement, widely recognized for its cholesterol regulating properties.

[01:29:53.826 --> 01:29:55.447]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.587 --> 01:29:59.710]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:02.691]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.791 --> 01:30:09.495]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.676 --> 01:30:12.697]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.898 --> 01:30:15.279]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.419 --> 01:30:20.142]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:20.302 --> 01:30:34.876]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.036 --> 01:30:42.362]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at

[01:30:53.507 --> 01:31:00.613]  Is black magic performed daily right in plain view on television, in movies, and in America's leading newspapers and magazines?
[01:31:01.254 --> 01:31:02.054]  I'm Tex Mars.
[01:31:02.454 --> 01:31:06.658]  My newest book, Codex Magicka, is a real eye-opener.
[01:31:06.678 --> 01:31:10.241]  624 pages, over 1,000 photographs.
[01:31:10.781 --> 01:31:19.629]  Codex Magicka shows the world's leading celebrities, from movie stars and presidents to bankers and senators, caught in the act.
[01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:23.855]  Discover the true secret signs of the Illuminati.
[01:31:24.136 --> 01:31:25.538]  Their mysterious symbols.
[01:31:25.879 --> 01:31:27.421]  Their hidden language.
[01:31:28.042 --> 01:31:28.924]  Encyclopedic.
[01:31:29.504 --> 01:31:30.125]  Documented.
[01:31:30.406 --> 01:31:31.327]  Codex Magicka.
[01:31:31.448 --> 01:31:34.493]  Unmask a conspiracy of immense evil.
[01:31:35.276 --> 01:31:44.387]  Please order your personal copy of Codex Magicka on the internet at PowerOfProphecy.com or simply phone toll free 1-800-234-9673.
[01:31:44.407 --> 01:31:44.648]  That's 1-800-234-9673.
[01:32:12.563 --> 01:32:21.587]  I'm trying to bring this into perspective.
[01:32:25.048 --> 01:32:28.949]  In my first documentary film, America Destroyed by Design, back in 1997,
[01:32:31.411 --> 01:32:41.574]  I traveled around the country and showed our national parks, our major government-owned ports, like Long Beach, the biggest port on the West Coast, the only major deep water port, worth tens of billions of dollars.
[01:32:42.274 --> 01:32:47.196]  And a sweetheart deal was basically given in a 50-year lease to the Communist Chinese government.
[01:32:48.356 --> 01:32:56.899]  Just like Hutchison Wampoa, their big front company, was just given the Panama Canal, even though American companies were giving greater bids on a canal we built.
[01:32:57.739 --> 01:33:03.821]  And the Republicans and Democrats will fight with each other on this on the surface, but behind the scenes they're taking the money, and this is happening.
[01:33:03.841 --> 01:33:07.963]  Now you've heard about United Arab Emirates getting six major ports.
[01:33:07.983 --> 01:33:15.305]  In fact, every major port on the East Coast, and then of course the port of New Orleans, that gives them a monopoly to charge whatever they want.
[01:33:15.825 --> 01:33:17.866]  That shouldn't be allowed just because of monopoly rules.
[01:33:18.486 --> 01:33:20.768]  Miami, Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
[01:33:20.788 --> 01:33:21.749]  I mean, all of them.
[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:24.072]  And by the way, they want more than six.
[01:33:24.692 --> 01:33:26.354]  So these are all the major ports.
[01:33:26.574 --> 01:33:29.537]  And then the Chinese have got, what, four ports on the West Coast.
[01:33:29.557 --> 01:33:31.018]  The biggest is Long Beach.
[01:33:31.359 --> 01:33:33.260]  Then they've got Freeport in the Bahamas.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:34.522]  They've got the Panama Canal.
[01:33:34.962 --> 01:33:38.926]  Not only are they shipping in the lion's share of the goods we buy on the store shelves, now this is happening.
[01:33:39.166 --> 01:33:40.667]  This is the same thing with the toll roads.
[01:33:40.788 --> 01:33:42.189]  I was just listening to Derry Brownville this morning.
[01:33:42.896 --> 01:33:51.141]  He was reading out of major Missouri papers, which they were admitting that, oh, Mexico is being given the lease and preferential treatment and control of the major railheads coming in.
[01:33:51.381 --> 01:33:53.082]  It's going to be an international zone.
[01:33:53.122 --> 01:33:55.044]  See, this is how they set up world government.
[01:33:55.064 --> 01:33:59.206]  They just start handing away the infrastructure to private interest.
[01:33:59.426 --> 01:34:01.508]  And Sal Costello joins us.
[01:34:01.808 --> 01:34:04.770]  Sal, give me your take on what I was just saying about
[01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:16.234]  How there's this massive handover taking place because these foreign lobbyists are in here basically feeding our politicians like vending machines and they put the money in, pull the lever, and get what they paid for.
[01:34:16.594 --> 01:34:18.295]  That's exactly what is happening.
[01:34:18.455 --> 01:34:27.618]  We've got governors all over the country, we're talking here in Texas, Governor Perry basically taking money in one hand for his campaign,
[01:34:28.298 --> 01:34:40.807]  And then with the other basically selling out, giving away our highways that we've paid for to private corporations and in many cases we're talking about foreign private corporations.
[01:34:40.887 --> 01:34:44.390]  So this is profits for foreign companies.
[01:34:45.190 --> 01:34:46.932]  It's basically a corporate welfare.
[01:34:47.492 --> 01:34:49.114]  Well, I call it corporate looting.
[01:34:49.174 --> 01:34:49.934]  I mean, that's what it is.
[01:34:49.954 --> 01:34:50.094]  It is.
[01:34:50.174 --> 01:34:50.274]  It is.
[01:34:50.295 --> 01:34:51.115]  It is corporate looting.
[01:34:51.135 --> 01:34:52.356]  It's corporate welfare.
[01:34:52.376 --> 01:34:56.720]  And Governor Perry here in this state, and we're dealing with local elections as well, and they're all weasels.
[01:35:15.439 --> 01:35:21.464]  And basically, we're trying to use legal and political muscle.
[01:35:21.584 --> 01:35:25.106]  And let's be clear, you guys have found a model that's very, very effective.
[01:35:25.566 --> 01:35:27.108]  This is happening all over the country.
[01:35:27.128 --> 01:35:28.829]  People need to always keep that in mind.
[01:35:28.849 --> 01:35:35.393]  90 plus percent in Houston polls, 98 percent in Austin polls, 93 percent, and that was a year ago.
[01:35:35.413 --> 01:35:36.714]  People are even more against it now.
[01:35:37.495 --> 01:35:38.656]  90 plus percent are against it.
[01:35:39.416 --> 01:35:42.058]  Even the Attorney General's office is saying a lot of this stuff is illegal.
[01:35:42.339 --> 01:35:43.960]  They're keeping the agreement secret.
[01:35:45.501 --> 01:35:47.303]  So no one wants this.
[01:35:47.383 --> 01:35:52.287]  It's a big scam, but still most of the politicians are for it because they're getting their pockets lined.
[01:35:52.327 --> 01:35:52.787]  Comment on it.
[01:35:52.827 --> 01:35:53.788]  That's exactly right.
[01:35:53.828 --> 01:35:59.412]  What we're doing is the heart of our organization is TexasTollParty.com online.
[01:35:59.833 --> 01:36:00.653]  That's where people come in.
[01:36:00.673 --> 01:36:01.374]  We connect with them.
[01:36:01.394 --> 01:36:02.615]  We continue to educate with them.
[01:36:03.075 --> 01:36:03.576]  We're good to go.
[01:36:19.369 --> 01:36:22.891]  But other folks in other states need to do the same type of thing.
[01:36:22.911 --> 01:36:29.594]  They need to connect with people, continue to educate, and then we're actually telling folks, hey look, we're doing this lawsuit.
[01:36:30.354 --> 01:36:31.415]  We've already had a couple of them.
[01:36:31.435 --> 01:36:32.095]  We've already won.
[01:36:32.135 --> 01:36:36.577]  We stopped one freeway toll in San Antonio just a few weeks ago through a lawsuit.
[01:36:36.918 --> 01:36:40.559]  We had another lawsuit where we wanted to keep the freeway tolling authority.
[01:36:40.599 --> 01:36:41.720]  These are unelected people.
[01:36:43.259 --> 01:36:46.801]  Who go and set the toll rates for roads we've already paid for.
[01:36:47.321 --> 01:36:48.382]  There's no accountability.
[01:36:48.842 --> 01:36:50.423]  And that's why it's so important to find out.
[01:36:50.443 --> 01:36:51.183]  That's right.
[01:36:52.124 --> 01:36:55.246]  The government signs a blank check with them.
[01:36:55.646 --> 01:37:02.670]  And then they claim no one has oversight, there's no transparency, the documents are all secret, because it's a private corporation that's going to run our roads.
[01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:04.211]  Yeah, it's a quasi-government
[01:37:04.651 --> 01:37:05.971]  It's baloney, that's what it is.
[01:37:06.392 --> 01:37:16.694]  And the state comptroller here in Texas basically produced an investigative report that is on TexasTollParty.com and she shows how this is double taxation without accountability.
[01:37:17.075 --> 01:37:20.095]  She shows how these board members... Why don't you show the camera that?
[01:37:20.115 --> 01:37:32.319]  Yeah, she shows how these board members have basically used our gas tax dollars meant for our roads, given out no-bid contracts to themselves and their friends.
[01:37:33.436 --> 01:37:40.518]  I mean, this is the kind of bureaucratic mess that Mike Cruzzi and Governor Perry is giving us.
[01:37:41.718 --> 01:37:43.639]  Any way you look at it, this is a scam.
[01:37:43.739 --> 01:37:46.480]  Well, this is really just mafia tactics.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.640]  It's worse than mafia tactics.
[01:37:48.901 --> 01:37:49.341]  It's absurd.
[01:37:50.821 --> 01:37:57.227]  This is going to cost families, people that can't afford it, thousands of dollars more a year just to drive to work.
[01:37:57.287 --> 01:38:00.370]  They say $3,000 to drive in Austin, $2,000 to drive outside the city.
[01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:03.252]  Now they're saying over $5,000 per Texan.
[01:38:03.592 --> 01:38:05.154]  And again, this is happening all over the country.
[01:38:05.174 --> 01:38:07.436]  We're just focusing on Texas as a microcosm.
[01:38:07.876 --> 01:38:13.881]  They admit 5,000 plus dollars and then they say, oh well the states don't have any more gas tax money.
[01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:19.205]  We've gone from 15 million barrels a day to 22 million barrels, 20 or 22 million barrels a day.
[01:38:19.745 --> 01:38:23.328]  Their own documents show they've got record gas tax receipts.
[01:38:23.428 --> 01:38:33.436]  But then, if a Texan is paying 24 cents a gallon in state tax right now, their own numbers say it will be the equivalent of $3 a gallon in tax.
[01:38:33.456 --> 01:38:34.136]  That's their numbers.
[01:38:34.576 --> 01:38:35.037]  At least.
[01:38:35.177 --> 01:38:36.438]  And that's what they're telling us.
[01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:43.964]  Now, in the past, when they built traditional toll roads, they would tell you that what they were doing was they were tying accountability into it.
[01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:44.544]  $3 a gallon!
[01:38:44.584 --> 01:38:45.325]  I've never heard of that!
[01:38:45.405 --> 01:38:50.689]  So, if my truck takes 24 gallons, what's 3 times 24?
[01:38:50.789 --> 01:38:53.931]  We're looking, ladies and gentlemen, at over $70.
[01:38:55.192 --> 01:38:57.473]  Oh yeah, it's just wrong.
[01:38:57.813 --> 01:38:59.094]  I mean, it's unethical.
[01:38:59.154 --> 01:39:00.734]  By the way, this is their own document, folks.
[01:39:00.814 --> 01:39:03.135]  I know this sounds incredibly horrible and unbelievable.
[01:39:03.555 --> 01:39:13.559]  Yeah, and actually in this report that you'll find at TexasTollParty.com, the comptroller did, she found one toll road at a dollar a mile.
[01:39:14.239 --> 01:39:18.001]  So if your car gets 20 miles to the gallon, that is equivalent to $20.
[01:39:19.816 --> 01:39:22.118]  More per gallon gas tax.
[01:39:22.158 --> 01:39:22.758]  That's the equivalent.
[01:39:22.898 --> 01:39:24.299]  And that's the state's own report.
[01:39:24.319 --> 01:39:38.408]  They're also trying now to take existing roads to bedroom communities outside Austin, a microcosm of the microcosm of the state itself, and thousands of people show up at rallies in order to take the existing road to neighborhoods and say, now it's a toll to get home.
[01:39:38.648 --> 01:39:40.389]  Yeah, and that's what they do.
[01:39:40.929 --> 01:39:45.812]  With traditional toll roads that are nothing like these, by the way, you had an alternative.
[01:39:45.852 --> 01:39:49.294]  You could drive the tollway or the free expressway.
[01:39:49.314 --> 01:39:56.017]  What they're doing here is they're taking all of our public expressways and they're tolling us and making us pay for what we've already paid for.
[01:39:56.337 --> 01:39:59.299]  They're tracking and tracing and automatically ticketing because that's what you're going to do.
[01:39:59.799 --> 01:40:04.441]  If you happen to go two miles over the speed limit, you don't have to wonder if you're going to get lucky or not if there's a police officer around.
[01:40:04.461 --> 01:40:09.263]  You're going to get a photograph of your license in the mail and a demand that you pay.
[01:40:09.524 --> 01:40:16.407]  And if you don't pay that ticket, they will charge you hundreds of dollars more just for missing that ticket.
[01:40:16.907 --> 01:40:17.587]  And that's the thing.
[01:40:17.627 --> 01:40:19.028]  They brag about this.
[01:40:19.048 --> 01:40:27.752]  They openly say with the transponders and the inspection stickers that were in the legislation last year, we barely beat by a couple votes, thanks to you guys and the Texas Toll Party and our listeners,
[01:40:28.661 --> 01:40:31.782]  I mean, this almost happened, but they're still putting the infrastructure in with the readers.
[01:40:32.142 --> 01:40:35.644]  Let's say you're driving 10 miles on the stretch of toll road on the existing highway.
[01:40:35.664 --> 01:40:37.885]  8,000 miles of them in the state now.
[01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:39.825]  It was 6,000, now it's going to be 8,000.
[01:40:40.266 --> 01:40:41.566]  Open-ended, the whole country has 7,000.
[01:40:41.606 --> 01:40:44.167]  So, put that in perspective.
[01:40:44.507 --> 01:40:53.711]  And if you speed from point A to point B, if your average speed was 5 miles over the speed limit, instant ticket without even the photo, it shows your transponder shows that you were speeding.
[01:40:54.051 --> 01:40:55.292]  That's exactly right.
[01:40:55.332 --> 01:40:58.393]  And that's why it's so important for people to get out and vote.
[01:40:58.693 --> 01:41:00.194]  And I know what you're going to say.
[01:41:00.214 --> 01:41:04.115]  You're going to say, well, they're going to mess with the votes.
[01:41:04.475 --> 01:41:10.178]  And we know that Vote Rescue is going to be out in Travis and Williamson County for these two votes.
[01:41:11.539 --> 01:41:13.240]  In a democratic primary?
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.761]  Well, look at election fraud.
[01:41:14.821 --> 01:41:18.264]  If we totally overwhelm them, it's hard for them to cook the numbers.
[01:41:18.404 --> 01:41:24.169]  And just a week ago, the anti-tolerant underdog won against a well-financed globalist.
[01:41:24.489 --> 01:41:25.570]  That is exactly correct.
[01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:26.510]  And we want to do it again.
[01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:27.211]  And here's the beauty.
[01:41:27.731 --> 01:41:34.797]  If they do mess with the votes, Vote Rescue shows us that there's a different voting pattern than what the results are.
[01:41:35.297 --> 01:41:37.138]  We are prepared to file lawsuits.
[01:41:37.198 --> 01:41:38.318]  We already have the corporation.
[01:41:38.338 --> 01:41:39.518]  You've already filed one lawsuit.
[01:41:39.538 --> 01:41:40.158]  Tell us about that.
[01:41:40.198 --> 01:41:41.679]  We've actually filed three lawsuits.
[01:41:42.079 --> 01:41:46.380]  The first one was actually the Regional Mobility Authority.
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:48.761]  They wanted us to have six-year terms, these unelected people.
[01:41:49.281 --> 01:41:51.442]  We showed them how in the Constitution they should only have two.
[01:41:51.902 --> 01:41:54.442]  We filed a lawsuit, the judge agreed, and we won the case.
[01:41:54.983 --> 01:41:59.304]  Then they turned and went to the, they wanted to change our Constitution to give them six-year terms.
[01:41:59.324 --> 01:42:00.204]  These are unelected people.
[01:42:01.686 --> 01:42:08.850]  And we work statewide with all kinds of organizations, and you folks here, and everything, and we stopped Prop 9 in last November.
[01:42:09.911 --> 01:42:13.613]  So that was fantastic, and that's an example of how we're using legal and political power.
[01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:19.297]  And now we've got Karen Sunlightner, who is the Toll Road Queen.
[01:42:20.638 --> 01:42:23.620]  We need to remove her in the Democratic primary in Travis County.
[01:42:24.441 --> 01:42:27.943]  She needs to go, and we've got Mike Kruse in Williamson County.
[01:42:28.123 --> 01:42:31.125]  By the way, she's always been a monster.
[01:42:31.165 --> 01:42:41.730]  In your ad, you have the Sheriff's Department, you have Vice President Alex Leo, Travis County Sheriff's Law Enforcement Association head, and he's saying, we cannot trust Karen Sunlightner.
[01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:44.471]  It's a charter, a character issue.
[01:42:44.712 --> 01:42:45.752]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:47.133]  I mean, she's got to go.
[01:42:47.153 --> 01:42:53.236]  The only problem is, she's sending out direct mail pieces with all the money she's gotten from all the special interest tollers.
[01:42:53.971 --> 01:42:56.252]  That says that she's been fighting for free roads!
[01:42:58.153 --> 01:43:06.877]  Now look how cynical that is, how she's the queen of it here locally, and then she's, oh I've been fighting it, knowing the general public is totally uninformed.
[01:43:06.957 --> 01:43:19.262]  Oh yeah man, it's ridiculous, but we show how that she's voted to privatize and toll hundreds of millions of dollars of our public highways, she ignored 93% of the public feedback that opposed the tolls,
[01:43:20.114 --> 01:43:25.318]  She also, on a separate issue, raised our county taxes for all... That's you, Alex.
[01:43:25.338 --> 01:43:26.158]  You're in Travis County.
[01:43:26.599 --> 01:43:28.620]  Your tax is going to be raised because she wanted it raised.
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.941]  And folks, this is how it works.
[01:43:30.061 --> 01:43:31.182]  A big private interest.
[01:43:31.202 --> 01:43:33.003]  Look, we can go buy the politicians.
[01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:33.884]  We can take over.
[01:43:33.984 --> 01:43:34.164]  Oh yeah.
[01:43:34.224 --> 01:43:37.066]  And we can charge them more for their water, their power, and their roads.
[01:43:37.366 --> 01:43:38.927]  Just like Enron out in California.
[01:43:38.947 --> 01:43:40.148]  And they're doing it to us right now.
[01:43:40.308 --> 01:43:40.829]  That's right.
[01:43:40.889 --> 01:43:45.892]  And as we pay more for all of this mess, she actually gave herself a raise.
[01:43:47.433 --> 01:43:49.695]  It seems like the county commissioner's court does that every year now.
[01:43:50.532 --> 01:43:51.572]  Well, that's part of the problem.
[01:43:51.852 --> 01:43:52.332]  Exactly.
[01:43:52.773 --> 01:44:01.795]  They feel like our budgets, we don't have a set budget, our families... And they're always getting DWI's too, but then they support all the police state measures.
[01:44:02.395 --> 01:44:02.635]  Yeah.
[01:44:03.255 --> 01:44:05.336]  I mean, with Biscoe, the county judge... That's right.
[01:44:05.596 --> 01:44:07.196]  And now he's running unopposed.
[01:44:08.216 --> 01:44:09.817]  Oh, you're drunk driving?
[01:44:11.117 --> 01:44:12.357]  We'll run unopposed against you.
[01:44:12.577 --> 01:44:16.038]  Well, that was when he was young and he was, you know, misinformed youth.
[01:44:16.138 --> 01:44:17.299]  What was that, a year and a half ago?
[01:44:17.539 --> 01:44:17.719]  Yeah.
[01:44:19.731 --> 01:44:21.994]  Well, I mean, it's like Barrientos.
[01:44:22.054 --> 01:44:24.757]  And then that gets brought up about their character at these big meetings.
[01:44:25.217 --> 01:44:26.959]  And then they go, how dare you bring that up?
[01:44:27.059 --> 01:44:28.281]  Oh, you have to respect us.
[01:44:28.581 --> 01:44:29.602]  Have some respect.
[01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:37.431]  Oh, you can ignore us and do whatever your special interest friends want you to do, like puppets, but we have to have respect.
[01:44:38.587 --> 01:44:41.009]  What about, is it a respect that you're supposed to represent us?
[01:44:41.089 --> 01:44:42.129]  I mean, that's part of the problem here.
[01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:45.171]  Our representatives are corrupt.
[01:44:45.332 --> 01:44:46.893]  And that's what we have to do.
[01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:47.333]  Well, you're right.
[01:44:47.353 --> 01:44:48.714]  You were trying to tell us about Kruze.
[01:44:48.734 --> 01:44:49.835]  He's a real piece of work.
[01:44:50.475 --> 01:44:59.921]  Kruze is the person that put up the legislation for Texans for the Trans-Texas Corridor that will take Texans' land and give the profits to private corporations, Cintra.
[01:45:01.142 --> 01:45:06.686]  And also, we've actually put an ad in four newspapers this past weekend.
[01:45:07.607 --> 01:45:08.428]  I don't think so.
[01:45:20.515 --> 01:45:24.518]  The beautiful part about these primaries is a very low voter turnout.
[01:45:24.979 --> 01:45:28.762]  The last non-presidential primary for Cruzzi only had 11,000 people voting.
[01:45:28.782 --> 01:45:29.443]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:45:29.483 --> 01:45:33.586]  How can 90 plus percent of people be against it and how can these people still win?
[01:45:33.686 --> 01:45:36.849]  Well, they send out mailers saying they're against the tolls when they're the kingpins.
[01:45:37.069 --> 01:45:37.429]  That's right.
[01:45:37.489 --> 01:45:47.738]  And Cruzzi's actually doing a push poll now, telling everybody his opponent, who is Barbara Samuelson, you can learn more about her at VoteBarbara.com, how she is a Canadian.
[01:45:48.496 --> 01:45:50.497]  I mean, that's how he deals with this.
[01:45:50.857 --> 01:45:51.737]  She's a Canadian.
[01:45:52.077 --> 01:45:53.177]  Don't go vote for her.
[01:45:54.397 --> 01:46:05.260]  But he has nothing, and one of his push-pull questions is, how would you feel if Mike Cruzzi wanted to give more money to schools, or wanted to do this for schools?
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.561]  But the truth is, he always voted to take money away from schools.
[01:46:10.622 --> 01:46:18.929]  And actually, we say here in the ad that he's actually diverting education funds to pay for double tax freeway tolls.
[01:46:19.329 --> 01:46:20.830]  And they call it the Texas Mobility Fund.
[01:46:20.850 --> 01:46:21.671]  Now let's be specific.
[01:46:21.851 --> 01:46:24.914]  We, the taxpayers, pay for the handover to these people.
[01:46:26.054 --> 01:46:27.315]  You pay to get raped.
[01:46:27.796 --> 01:46:28.396]  Oh, exactly.
[01:46:28.496 --> 01:46:29.317]  That's exactly right.
[01:46:29.397 --> 01:46:39.065]  But one of the things he's been pushing is $4.5 billion of our tax dollars or more over a 25 to 30 year bond period will be diverted from the Texas
[01:46:39.645 --> 01:46:44.847]  Now you've got a list of states that have similar and the same companies, the same things rampaging forward.
[01:46:44.867 --> 01:46:47.228]  Give us some of those for people around the country.
[01:47:04.153 --> 01:47:04.853]  That's exactly right.
[01:47:05.033 --> 01:47:06.394]  Basically, I keep up with this.
[01:47:06.714 --> 01:47:08.054]  I've got a blog that you can see.
[01:47:08.194 --> 01:47:11.855]  If you go to TexasTollParty.com, the news blog, you can find it there.
[01:47:12.236 --> 01:47:13.756]  Yeah, folks, we're on the front lines.
[01:47:13.776 --> 01:47:14.896]  We're talking about Texas here.
[01:47:14.936 --> 01:47:16.037]  We're on the front lines.
[01:47:16.117 --> 01:47:16.737]  Oh yeah, we are.
[01:47:17.137 --> 01:47:21.698]  But there are other states, and if you go to Google, and you can do the same, you can even have things automatically sent to you.
[01:47:22.499 --> 01:47:24.599]  But what I've got here is North Carolina.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.120]  We've reported stuff from North Carolina.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:27.840]  Utah.
[01:47:31.151 --> 01:47:49.720]  We're talking about Mississippi, basically every state, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Massachusetts, Florida, and it's all centered on a few other companies.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:58.164]  That's exactly right, and if you're listening and you're saying, well they're not doing it here, the fact is they're pushing legislation or they've already done it.
[01:47:58.704 --> 01:48:01.305]  So it's actually, this stuff started years ago.
[01:48:01.325 --> 01:48:02.045]  Yeah, you never hear about it.
[01:48:02.065 --> 01:48:04.366]  It starts five years before and then, boom, it happens.
[01:48:04.486 --> 01:48:12.889]  And the legislatures will be paid off to sign all their authority over to a private board that the wives of the toll companies sit on.
[01:48:13.249 --> 01:48:13.529]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:13.709 --> 01:48:19.031]  I mean, literally, folks, we could do five hours just on the conflict of interest is two kinds of work.
[01:48:19.271 --> 01:48:20.832]  This is huge corruption.
[01:48:21.712 --> 01:48:23.813]  We need to remove Rick Perry in November.
[01:48:23.833 --> 01:48:26.014]  He's a monster.
[01:48:26.474 --> 01:48:28.315]  It looks like he's for open borders.
[01:48:28.555 --> 01:48:34.618]  He has the head lobbyist for Mexico as his Texas-Mexico relations head.
[01:48:34.678 --> 01:48:35.538]  That's illegal.
[01:48:35.558 --> 01:48:36.819]  That was in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:48:36.999 --> 01:48:37.979]  But no one seems to care.
[01:48:38.219 --> 01:48:42.761]  So he sends a hundred cops down to the border to claim that's going to stop the border incursions.
[01:48:42.801 --> 01:48:43.822]  It's nothing but a photo op.
[01:48:44.262 --> 01:48:45.503]  Yeah, I mean, that's how he works.
[01:48:45.643 --> 01:48:57.607]  And then he steps up and says, I'm a conservative Republican, even though he's creating a whole new tax by taxing us to drive, to work, school, and play, and shop, and handing over our infrastructure to private corporations.
[01:48:57.627 --> 01:49:03.309]  And you tell conservatives out on the ground, because I'm what you'd call a classical conservative if you want to use those terms, and they go, it ain't true.
[01:49:03.329 --> 01:49:10.511]  I was in a gun shop the other day, and they were going behind the counter, it ain't true what you said at Bush before the assault weapons ban.
[01:49:10.551 --> 01:49:11.012]  I'm like, what?
[01:49:11.072 --> 01:49:11.832]  He was on TV!
[01:49:12.632 --> 01:49:15.594]  It's very frustrating, but it actually inspires us to continue to go out and fight.
[01:49:15.614 --> 01:49:18.697]  We've won a whole bunch of battles, we've stopped over a dozen of these
[01:49:31.886 --> 01:49:32.506]  You guys are.
[01:49:32.566 --> 01:49:34.888]  Folks, you should go to the Texas Toll Party website.
[01:49:34.908 --> 01:49:38.871]  We've got links to it on InfoWars.com and get involved in this fight because we're having a lot of victories.
[01:49:38.931 --> 01:49:41.973]  And Sal, I want to commend you for all you've done, my friend.
[01:49:42.013 --> 01:49:43.033]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:49:43.073 --> 01:49:44.014]  Thanks for your support, Alex.
[01:49:44.314 --> 01:49:44.554]  You bet.
[01:49:44.594 --> 01:49:44.955]  Thank you.
[01:49:44.975 --> 01:49:45.275]  Take care.
[01:49:47.937 --> 01:49:48.577]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:48.597 --> 01:49:50.098]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.716 --> 01:49:57.578]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.818 --> 01:49:59.399]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.739 --> 01:50:04.422]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.743 --> 01:50:11.487]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.827 --> 01:50:13.809]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:14.009 --> 01:50:16.851]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.952 --> 01:50:21.616]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.816 --> 01:50:26.220]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:50:54.162 --> 01:50:59.385]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.545 --> 01:51:07.630]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.890 --> 01:51:14.934]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:15.895 --> 01:51:22.380]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:27.644]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.764 --> 01:51:36.652]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:36.912 --> 01:51:40.194]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:53:18.015 --> 01:53:19.375]  Final segment of the second hour.
[01:53:19.395 --> 01:53:37.523]  For the entire next hour, we've got Jack Blood, local talk show host, right here on the Genesis Network joining us, because one of his sources here locally, there's so much corruption in all piles up around us, discovered some amazing things about the heart of the NAFTA International Highway that most Austinites and Texans and Americans aren't even aware of.
[01:53:37.543 --> 01:53:41.905]  They're building the gigantic 10-lane sucker right now, and they're going to use your toll money
[01:53:42.697 --> 01:53:43.557]  To build it, and guess what?
[01:53:43.597 --> 01:53:45.398]  Americans won't even have preferential treatment on it.
[01:53:45.838 --> 01:53:54.782]  That's right, Chinese trains, Mexican trucks, it's going to be a wonderland with Homeland Security running it, TSA goons, Viper teams, as they're called, on it.
[01:53:55.342 --> 01:54:03.326]  In the last two weeks, two people died being run over by the big machinery, and they're getting all these fines and fees for improper activities, the way they're building it.
[01:54:04.106 --> 01:54:06.267]  It is just amazing, so wait until you hear
[01:54:07.047 --> 01:54:14.811]  We'll spend about 30 minutes in the next hour on this big story Jack's breaking here, and then I want to talk about a bunch of other international and national news items with Jack.
[01:54:15.551 --> 01:54:17.032]  Jack, it's good to have you in here.
[01:54:17.072 --> 01:54:21.694]  Before we go to this quick break, what do you think of our Dick Cheney test we've done?
[01:54:22.375 --> 01:54:23.576]  You know, that's outstanding.
[01:54:23.616 --> 01:54:31.684]  That diagnostic that you've done on the shotgun related to the cover story by Vice President Dick Cheney should be all over.
[01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:33.546]  This should be all over the mainstream media.
[01:54:33.586 --> 01:54:40.252]  I don't think anyone's actually taken the time to even just do as much as you guys have done, and you've proven that Dick Cheney is lying.
[01:54:41.033 --> 01:54:46.338]  I just read a report, Alex, that the official sheriff's report has just come out as an hour ago, and
[01:54:47.992 --> 01:54:49.273]  They have cleared Dick Cheney.
[01:54:49.293 --> 01:54:54.975]  This is the front page news story above the fold on the Austin Un-American-Statesman.
[01:54:55.216 --> 01:54:56.156]  That Cheney is clear.
[01:54:56.196 --> 01:54:57.437]  There will be no charges.
[01:54:57.697 --> 01:54:59.558]  And he's going to get away with this scot-free.
[01:54:59.598 --> 01:55:01.979]  Now again, if this happens to you and me...
[01:55:02.794 --> 01:55:22.715]  We have to understand that we would be under investigation, our guns would be confiscated and would be analyzed, we would be hiring lawyers at tens of thousands of dollars a pop to defend ourselves, but Dick Cheney's above the law and that's exactly the metaphor for everything that Dick Cheney and George Bush has done for the last five, six years.
[01:55:23.903 --> 01:55:30.147]  You had a chance before someone snuck onto the server and erased it off both servers, or three servers, just about an hour ago.
[01:55:30.167 --> 01:55:40.695]  You had a chance to see my 10-minute reenactment and scientific ballistic analysis of Chaney, proving he shot Mr. Whittington from 15 to 18 feet, not 90 feet.
[01:55:40.735 --> 01:55:41.615]  That is so key.
[01:55:42.136 --> 01:55:43.697]  And believe me, we've never had something like this.
[01:55:43.717 --> 01:55:46.899]  They are going directly on every time we load it up and erasing it off the server.
[01:55:47.748 --> 01:55:52.073]  Well, you better believe it, and let's try to, look, we can come up with a summation here.
[01:55:52.133 --> 01:55:55.537]  We can theorize a little bit or editorialize a little bit.
[01:55:55.798 --> 01:56:01.785]  How was Dick Cheney able to shoot Mr. Whittington from, you say, maybe 15 feet away without knowing it?
[01:56:02.567 --> 01:56:08.612]  Now, we know that he admits that he had a beer, one beer, at the picnic before he went out hunting.
[01:56:08.892 --> 01:56:14.496]  This is the equivalent of, if people out there have ever watched Cops, where they get pulled over and the officer asks, have you been drinking?
[01:56:14.757 --> 01:56:16.758]  And the people say, well, I've had a glass of wine.
[01:56:17.158 --> 01:56:22.182]  And the officer says, BS, I'm going to give you tests and I'm not going to believe your story.
[01:56:22.202 --> 01:56:25.505]  Well, we just automatically believe that Dick Cheney just had one beer.
[01:56:25.545 --> 01:56:27.987]  So, look, I'm thinking that he was drinking.
[01:56:28.327 --> 01:56:30.989]  I'm not even sure if they were hunting, Alex, as you proved.
[01:56:31.229 --> 01:56:37.973]  With your diagnostic test, that those BBs, and they are BBs, birdshot, would not have penetrated Whittington's heart.
[01:56:38.654 --> 01:56:41.756]  I'm wondering if something else was going on besides hunting.
[01:56:42.036 --> 01:56:43.397]  Whether they were playing with guns.
[01:56:43.437 --> 01:56:48.560]  Whether Dick Cheney got drunk and went into a rage and shot Whittington because he didn't like his looks.
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.321]  I mean, this is something Channing would do!
[01:56:50.601 --> 01:57:07.367]  Well, we know from the very start of it, they have been engaging in a massive cover-up, not letting the police in for 13 and a half hours, if you want to get precise, and not letting the public know for 22 hours, taking him to a hospital further away, saying he wasn't hurt very bad, but using an emergency care flight to take him, and it turns out the hospital knew he had BBs in his heart.
[01:57:07.407 --> 01:57:10.389]  Day one, they had to catheterize the heart because of massive bleeding.
[01:57:10.589 --> 01:57:15.050]  When the heart gets perforated, it squirts blood and fills up the, uh, what is it, peritoneum, the bag,

[01:57:54.785 --> 01:57:55.586]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.346 --> 01:57:57.266]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.286 --> 01:58:01.667]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.107 --> 01:58:06.208]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.569 --> 01:58:09.529]  I know we haven't gotten a lot of your calls today.
[01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:12.510]  It's because I've been covering so much news and had another guest on last hour.
[01:58:13.608 --> 01:58:31.881]  In this hour, Jack Blood joins us to talk about a host of issues, but predominantly, here in the first half hour, we're going to be talking about a major new toll road story and NAFTA highway story that Jack, for several weeks, what, three weeks, has been talking to someone working inside the state at very high levels.
[01:58:32.281 --> 01:58:34.503]  He has an entire satchel of documents.
[01:58:35.244 --> 01:58:38.426]  These things are confidential.
[01:58:39.106 --> 01:58:51.595]  And it just goes into what's happening with the construction of the NAFTA highway, I-30, that is going to be one of the hubs for the new super NAFTA I-35 that goes up into Kansas City and into St.
[01:58:51.635 --> 01:58:52.855]  Louis and into Minneapolis-St.
[01:58:52.895 --> 01:59:06.024]  Paul to then be the main aorta for the entire control grid as they hand over our entire infrastructure to foreign companies like United Arab Emirates and the Spanish consortium Centra and many others.
[01:59:06.344 --> 01:59:07.125]  Jack, go ahead and
[01:59:07.125 --> 01:59:07.405]  Thank you.
[01:59:22.663 --> 01:59:23.324]  Sure, Alex.
[01:59:23.784 --> 01:59:26.887]  First of all, let me just tell your listeners that this is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:59:26.927 --> 01:59:28.989]  I mean, there are more documents to go through.
[01:59:29.009 --> 01:59:30.731]  This is our initial report.
[01:59:30.811 --> 01:59:37.437]  We're going to be adding a lot more real evidence, not circumstantial evidence, printed, documented evidence to the story that I'm about to tell you.
[01:59:37.777 --> 01:59:38.618]  And it starts like this.
[01:59:38.678 --> 01:59:39.359]  The good news
[01:59:39.819 --> 01:59:43.382]  Is that the Trans-Texas Corridor is ahead of schedule and under budget.
[01:59:43.402 --> 01:59:46.465]  But why is it under budget and ahead of schedule?
[01:59:46.765 --> 01:59:49.288]  And we're starting to get these leaks of information.
[01:59:49.328 --> 01:59:53.371]  Well, about a year ago I met an inspector of the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:59:53.431 --> 01:59:56.674]  He's a young guy, but he'd risen to a management position.
[01:59:56.734 --> 02:00:00.818]  A major lead inspector for a company that is contracted to
[02:00:01.198 --> 02:00:06.140]  Make sure that all these toll roads are built up to code, up to government specified code.
[02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:13.643]  Now obviously there are codes to make sure that the travel ways, the infrastructure is safe for travel and obviously safe for investment.
[02:00:13.683 --> 02:00:14.743]  That's the key word here.
[02:00:15.444 --> 02:00:25.348]  We're asked to invest billions of dollars into this massive control grid and what I'm about to tell you is that control grid is already crumbling beneath our very feet.
[02:00:25.548 --> 02:00:26.308]  And here's why.
[02:00:26.628 --> 02:00:28.249]  So I met the inspector and
[02:00:29.502 --> 02:00:32.506]  He began to tell me some very odd, off-the-record stories, Alex.
[02:00:32.546 --> 02:00:44.341]  The first story he told me, and I'll lead up to the major evidence here, but the first story he told me was how there were a lot of illegal immigrants working on the Trans-Texas Corridor, and there were a number of accidents, okay, where they were dying.
[02:00:44.982 --> 02:00:46.745]  There have been two of those in the last two weeks.
[02:00:47.478 --> 02:00:52.839]  Well, they are just peppered throughout the entire construction of the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.380]  And I've gotten details on some of them.
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:59.281]  But it initially struck me, because you don't ever see anything about this in the paper.
[02:00:59.301 --> 02:01:03.662]  You don't see anything or hear anything about it, obviously, in the CAMPO meetings or the meetings that we attend.
[02:01:03.902 --> 02:01:06.383]  This is a completely buried issue.
[02:01:06.443 --> 02:01:06.863]  That's right, Jack.
[02:01:06.883 --> 02:01:09.364]  You've been going to dozens of these meetings the last year.
[02:01:09.384 --> 02:01:10.864]  I mean, that's why you're on the inside of this now.
[02:01:11.639 --> 02:01:11.859]  Right.
[02:01:11.919 --> 02:01:17.324]  Well, it's funny enough that my contact I met, I did not meet by going to the meetings.
[02:01:17.344 --> 02:01:23.849]  It's somebody that came to me as somebody in the media, somebody that I'm connected with in a number of other ways.
[02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:31.516]  To continue with this story, so then the next thing he comes and tells me is that they're building a
[02:01:32.523 --> 02:01:34.424]  A military superhighway, Alex!
[02:01:34.444 --> 02:01:36.465]  This is something, again, that we're never hearing about.
[02:01:36.765 --> 02:01:45.549]  A military, giant, super 10-lane highway to run parallel with the Trans-Texas Corridor, which will run from San Antonio to Dallas.
[02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:58.756]  Now, I start thinking about this, and they're taking bids on this now, but obviously there's nothing illegal about the military building a giant superhighway to move their infrastructure and their tanks, but when you ask yourself, why do they need that here in Texas,
[02:01:58.976 --> 02:02:02.658]  You come up with some very strange questions, okay?
[02:02:02.818 --> 02:02:04.399]  And then I'm reminded of Hitler.
[02:02:04.419 --> 02:02:18.168]  When Hitler was first brought to power in Germany, the first thing he did was start to build these giant, massive, super-wide highways and improve the infrastructure because he knew he had to move his military machinery and he was about to go to war on the front lines.
[02:02:18.448 --> 02:02:23.511]  We're just getting into the real, hardcore evidence of what we have here, Alex.
[02:02:23.531 --> 02:02:25.372]  When we come back, I'd like to share that with your listeners.
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:43.112]  We'll be sure and do that when we return after this quick break and we've got the story up on InfoWars.com and of course it's InfoWars.com, JackBlood.com exclusive news story and we're going to get into the documents about how they're failing every major test and it's being covered up.
[02:02:43.132 --> 02:02:43.572]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.508 --> 02:02:53.890]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:54.171 --> 02:02:58.912]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:59.132 --> 02:03:04.774]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:05.014 --> 02:03:09.537]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.757 --> 02:03:16.922]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.942 --> 02:03:21.485]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.645 --> 02:03:24.146]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:24.387 --> 02:03:31.091]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:04:56.005 --> 02:04:57.206]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:04:57.546 --> 02:04:58.948]  Now's the time to fight back.

[02:05:45.436 --> 02:05:50.480]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.840 --> 02:05:53.162]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.462 --> 02:06:02.989]  The problem is, with everything we do, we can spend hours on each little facet of the corruption.
[02:06:03.410 --> 02:06:04.570]  It's just wall to wall.
[02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:08.453]  You know, I've been talking about this a lot lately because I can't get over it.
[02:06:08.533 --> 02:06:12.997]  The Chicago Tribune and other major publications admit that Dyncor and Halliburton are running white slavery rings.
[02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:17.847]  And kidnapping women and children for slave labor, sex slave, everything.
[02:06:17.907 --> 02:06:18.548]  It's just right there.
[02:06:18.568 --> 02:06:23.910]  And it says, oh, and they've got legal lobbyists lobbying just for their slave trade at Capitol Hill.
[02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:25.370]  And here's their names.
[02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:27.811]  And you can have congressional hearings about it.
[02:06:28.571 --> 02:06:30.452]  And Rumsfeld just says, there's nothing we're going to do about it.
[02:06:31.132 --> 02:06:37.815]  And I mean, if you think they can get away with that, folks, they're going to rob your roads and rip you off and scam you and do all of this.
[02:06:38.630 --> 02:06:39.931]  And this is internationalism.
[02:06:39.951 --> 02:06:42.173]  Understand, to take over a country, you take over its roads.
[02:06:42.193 --> 02:06:50.359]  They're just taking the roads, handing it over to international bodies, international corporations, and then they're going to have this 10-mile buffer zone on each side.
[02:06:50.539 --> 02:06:51.760]  This is the takeover.
[02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:54.181]  This is America going into the World Union.
[02:06:54.501 --> 02:06:55.983]  This is the Pan-American Union.
[02:06:56.203 --> 02:07:00.105]  It's in the newspapers down here that Mexico has more control over the roads.
[02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:04.849]  We're going to have in Texas these Transnapa roads, and we will through the treaties as a state.
[02:07:06.114 --> 02:07:11.021]  Again, I heard Gary Brownville this morning talking about how Missouri is going to be, the railroads will be run by Mexico.
[02:07:11.541 --> 02:07:15.286]  I mean, they're just giving foreign countries big pieces of this nation.
[02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:18.731]  Now, Jack Blood is a talk show host that comes on out after me every day.
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:20.381]  From 2 to 4 p.m.
[02:07:20.741 --> 02:07:21.841]  He's been going to a lot of these meetings.
[02:07:21.861 --> 02:07:23.082]  Just a recap for those that joined us.
[02:07:23.162 --> 02:07:25.223]  And he got internal documents, a whole satchel of them.
[02:07:25.703 --> 02:07:26.804]  And these have been, of course, confirmed.
[02:07:26.824 --> 02:07:28.285]  We got them up on InfoWars.com.
[02:07:28.325 --> 02:07:28.965]  An article about it.
[02:07:29.005 --> 02:07:31.607]  More of the documents will go up later in the day.
[02:07:31.947 --> 02:07:33.148]  And this isn't just the toll roads.
[02:07:33.188 --> 02:07:35.249]  This is the big giant NAFTA highway.
[02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:38.170]  A big 10-lane, and this has been secret, military highway.
[02:07:38.190 --> 02:07:39.071]  But we got the documents.
[02:07:39.371 --> 02:07:40.752]  And then another 10-lane highway.
[02:07:41.092 --> 02:07:42.953]  And yet, in the last two weeks, it has been in the news.
[02:07:42.973 --> 02:07:43.633]  It wasn't before.
[02:07:43.653 --> 02:07:45.354]  Illegal aliens are getting killed.
[02:07:45.374 --> 02:07:46.995]  I mean, every week on this thing.
[02:07:47.055 --> 02:07:48.256]  Run over by these big machines.
[02:07:48.616 --> 02:07:51.559]  Folks, they've got earthmovers you've never seen except in mining.
[02:07:51.819 --> 02:07:58.085]  These are big, gigantic things that, you know, five dump trucks can park in the bulldozer's scoop.
[02:07:58.425 --> 02:08:03.170]  I mean, they have mining equipment out there, building the equivalent of the Great Pyramid.
[02:08:03.630 --> 02:08:07.815]  And the average Austinite doesn't even know what's going on just east of us.
[02:08:07.855 --> 02:08:20.849]  So, Jack, go over this for people, and then let's get into what you discovered with this inspector that gave you these documents of how it's all failing, it's all substandard, and we're paying for it to then hand it over to an international body once we've paid for it.
[02:08:21.349 --> 02:08:34.443]  Right, well McCurry Bank or Spain Cintra, which are international partners they've bought and they're running the roads up in Indiana, as you know, they've also done the same thing here in Texas, might be interested, if they haven't closed the deal yet, to hear the information I have, because they're getting a lemon.
[02:08:34.863 --> 02:08:35.764]  This is what I've come upon.
[02:08:35.824 --> 02:08:38.187]  And let me just say, regarding the statements that you just made,
[02:08:38.647 --> 02:08:49.055]  The IMF, the World Bank, the international coalition of international companies have been looting and raping Africa, South America, Asia.
[02:08:49.215 --> 02:08:50.176]  It's now our turn.
[02:08:50.196 --> 02:08:54.019]  They've now come home to the United States and they're buying up our resources.
[02:08:54.079 --> 02:09:03.526]  In fact, I'm sure you know and your listeners might know or be aware of the fact that in Lake Michigan they bought the water rights to Illinois and areas surrounding the Great Lakes up there.
[02:09:03.566 --> 02:09:04.567]  They own the water.
[02:09:04.847 --> 02:09:07.209]  International companies own the water up there.
[02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:08.430]  But we're digressing.
[02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:15.253]  And by the way, they pay off the politicians, and the politicians sell them the water for literal chicken feed, or just give it to them!
[02:09:15.613 --> 02:09:19.954]  I mean, this is no different than what a third-world dictator is doing, and they're doing it right here in our country.
[02:09:20.014 --> 02:09:25.557]  Now, to move on with this story, I'm talking about my source, how he'd been leaking kind of off-the-record information.
[02:09:25.637 --> 02:09:32.779]  Even though I'd been going to these toll road meetings, I'd been involved as an activist in stopping the Trans-Texas Corridor, I kept my mouth shut.
[02:09:32.799 --> 02:09:35.761]  He didn't want me to talk about this stuff, and I never mentioned it to anyone, Alex.
[02:09:36.921 --> 02:09:40.723]  Two weeks ago, I received a call from my source, and he was panicked.
[02:09:40.743 --> 02:09:42.143]  He was panicking on the phone.
[02:09:42.383 --> 02:09:43.524]  They just about fired him.
[02:09:43.544 --> 02:09:45.265]  They fired one of his supervisors.
[02:09:45.525 --> 02:09:46.485]  Why did they do that?
[02:09:46.565 --> 02:09:57.050]  Because these guys, as inspectors on the freeway, on the Trans-Texas Corridor, have been failing and failing and failing every test, particularly as it relates to the cement.
[02:09:57.794 --> 02:09:57.994]  No.
[02:09:58.434 --> 02:10:01.136]  So they're telling him to falsify the certification, according to him.
[02:10:01.476 --> 02:10:04.677]  Well, he's failing and they're saying, don't worry about it, shut up about it.
[02:10:04.717 --> 02:10:07.379]  If you talk about it, you're going to be fired or you're going to be punished.
[02:10:07.559 --> 02:10:10.800]  And they also insinuate something worse could happen.
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:17.524]  You have to understand that once you get off one of these projects and you are considered to be a troublemaker, you can't work anywhere in the country.
[02:10:17.544 --> 02:10:18.324]  You're blackballed.
[02:10:18.564 --> 02:10:19.666]  So he's very concerned.
[02:10:19.686 --> 02:10:26.934]  He's a young man with a big career ahead of him, and now he's seeing this, and he's concerned for the safety of the people that might be driving on this road.
[02:10:26.955 --> 02:10:27.816]  He has a conscience.
[02:10:27.956 --> 02:10:34.604]  And this is the good thing, Alex, is that a lot of the people out there working on this infrastructure, or working in the military and the police, they have a conscience.
[02:10:34.784 --> 02:10:40.007]  And they won't go along with this corruption, they won't go along with this raping of our country.
[02:10:40.067 --> 02:10:45.269]  So he gets on the phone with me and he starts telling me what I'm telling you is a nuclear info bomb.
[02:10:45.449 --> 02:10:58.816]  He'd been failing tests for the quarter, he was working on and inspecting for the last year, after repeated attempts to have the failures corrected, both by himself and his immediate supervisor, and after seeing fellow inspectors threatened and fired, he'd had enough!
[02:10:59.256 --> 02:11:04.820]  And so what he began to tell me and what he shared with me here with these documents is four-part.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.902]  Let me just give me one quick second here to go over this.
[02:11:07.222 --> 02:11:14.648]  Number one, the crushed limestone used to make the concrete of which the toll roads are built with, okay, is very weak.
[02:11:14.868 --> 02:11:22.034]  And it's led to a total failure of most of the structures and superstructures currently standing as our future Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:11:22.134 --> 02:11:25.596]  The translation is these roads will fall apart long before they're paid for.
[02:11:26.037 --> 02:11:27.858]  Can we show those on television?
[02:11:27.858 --> 02:11:28.958]  We can show this right here.
[02:11:29.018 --> 02:11:31.859]  Now you can see, well, I don't know how close we are here.
[02:11:31.879 --> 02:11:32.340]  No, no, that's good.
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:33.260]  We have cameras in here.
[02:11:33.280 --> 02:11:34.200]  Later this will be seen.
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:37.001]  And we'll excise any key names and we'll post these.
[02:11:37.021 --> 02:11:39.902]  And you can see, this is where the concrete is tested.
[02:11:39.942 --> 02:11:40.803]  It goes up on a curve.
[02:11:40.843 --> 02:11:43.644]  This is where it needs to stay, at the top of the curve.
[02:11:43.984 --> 02:11:46.045]  Immediately, it starts failing.
[02:11:46.085 --> 02:11:54.948]  Now, when you hit an 80 degree temperature, what happens is this bad concrete, okay, made from unapproved or falsified crushed limestone... Expands.
[02:11:55.508 --> 02:12:01.590]  It expands and it allows moisture to come in, which of course starts degrading the actual cement itself.
[02:12:01.610 --> 02:12:03.491]  So that's the first thing that we found.
[02:12:04.231 --> 02:12:14.054]  The second thing is that the charts done by my source, which you're looking at right now and other inspectors, are showing that the standing infrastructure is failing what is called dry density test.
[02:12:14.094 --> 02:12:15.035]  We just talked about that.
[02:12:15.315 --> 02:12:15.915]  Meaning that the
[02:12:16.576 --> 02:12:20.940]  Crappy, cheap concrete is already decaying from excessive moisture.
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:24.564]  Alex, right now, it's only several months old, as we know.
[02:12:24.864 --> 02:12:31.552]  We're already looking at a 5.1 to 8 percent loss in concrete integrity just over the last several months.
[02:12:31.572 --> 02:12:32.633]  I mean, can you imagine?
[02:12:32.653 --> 02:12:34.074]  I mean, you look at my chart.
[02:12:34.114 --> 02:12:35.176]  It's nose-diving.
[02:12:35.196 --> 02:12:38.159]  Can you imagine what this is going to look like in three or four years?
[02:12:39.171 --> 02:12:46.456]  Well, we've already had structures built 20 years ago that weren't done exactly to expect the collapse of people driving over them on a routine basis in this state.
[02:12:46.616 --> 02:12:50.999]  Not to mention if we have a natural disaster or an earthquake or God forbid something even worse.
[02:12:51.319 --> 02:12:53.101]  So now... Well, plus it's our tax money.
[02:12:53.301 --> 02:12:54.982]  I mean, it shows what's going on here.
[02:12:55.655 --> 02:12:58.056]  But you notice in the past they didn't do stuff like this at this level.
[02:12:58.076 --> 02:13:04.059]  It's like the whole government is just wildly looting like cockroaches that you've sprayed with poison and start fornicating.
[02:13:04.139 --> 02:13:10.342]  What we have is a massive, I hate to use the word conspiracy, but everybody seems to be in on it.
[02:13:10.522 --> 02:13:17.826]  From the people initially, the geological inspectors who were initially supposed to inspect the limestone that makes the concrete.
[02:13:18.206 --> 02:13:24.809]  Everybody seems to be in on it, according to these documents I have Alex, and falsifying records, doing inadequate tests.
[02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:29.493]  If you go through a number of my documents here, you'll see failed, failed, failed, failed.
[02:13:29.613 --> 02:13:30.454]  Everything fails.
[02:13:30.715 --> 02:13:33.137]  Reported to supervisor, told me to shut up.
[02:13:33.217 --> 02:13:39.883]  I mean, there are a number of tests that have to be reported on any given section of the freeway.
[02:13:39.903 --> 02:13:42.346]  And I'll go over a couple of them here for your local audience.
[02:13:42.606 --> 02:13:43.207]  They're not even...
[02:13:43.627 --> 02:13:52.895]  Not only are they failing and not repairing what they've failed, what the inspectors have failed, they're not even doing the amount of tests that are required by law on the superstructure itself.
[02:13:52.915 --> 02:14:00.462]  So they're not doing as many tests as they should be doing, and the ones they are doing are failing, and they're moving on down the freeway and continuing to build in this manner.
[02:14:00.722 --> 02:14:03.404]  Last hour I said this all sounds like mafia activities.
[02:14:03.424 --> 02:14:04.925]  This is classical mafia activity.
[02:14:04.945 --> 02:14:05.286]  Absolutely.
[02:14:05.866 --> 02:14:09.269]  Well, I mean, Mafia has always been in the construction business, and this is the thing.
[02:14:09.309 --> 02:14:23.701]  I think we can look on a grander scale and see how the, you know, the administration or Robert F. Kennedy or whoever went after the Mafia, and what happened was they took them out and replaced the Mafia with the government or with these contractors now.
[02:14:23.761 --> 02:14:26.163]  Contractors is the word we hear even with military.
[02:14:26.483 --> 02:14:35.533]  So the old school mafia were making so much money and paved the way that the real globalist bloodsuckers saw what a great opportunity this was and they took over their business.
[02:14:35.553 --> 02:14:42.480]  They basically strong-armed them and moved them out of their territory much like any mafia capo would do with a rival gang.
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:44.061]  I mean you hit that nail right on the head.
[02:14:44.101 --> 02:14:46.304]  Let me continue with this and there's a little bit more here.
[02:14:47.044 --> 02:14:52.167]  Again, as I just mentioned, documents reflecting the number of tests needed from August to October of 2005.
[02:14:52.407 --> 02:14:56.650]  We found that the SH-130 Turnpike alone had tests performed.
[02:14:56.670 --> 02:15:00.892]  We have required tests again versus the tests that they've actually performed.
[02:15:01.292 --> 02:15:05.775]  Way under, probably about 30% under what they should be testing for.
[02:15:05.815 --> 02:15:07.336]  They're just not even bothering to test.
[02:15:07.456 --> 02:15:07.716]  Okay?
[02:15:07.896 --> 02:15:08.576]  So that's another thing.
[02:15:08.596 --> 02:15:09.317]  And then finally,
[02:15:09.637 --> 02:15:15.559]  The test on the concrete failed consistently on, and here's some of the places locally here in Texas for your local listeners.
[02:15:15.819 --> 02:15:18.000]  The Hanson aggregate freeways, failing.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:19.100]  Massively failing.
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:21.601]  The Burnett Grade 2 aggregate, failing.
[02:15:21.981 --> 02:15:24.742]  The RTI Georgetown aggregate, failing.
[02:15:24.782 --> 02:15:28.884]  The Capitol Balm Road and the Travis aggregates, failing.
[02:15:29.144 --> 02:15:31.285]  TXI Green Plant, failing.
[02:15:31.425 --> 02:15:32.305]  Everything failing.
[02:15:32.645 --> 02:15:35.426]  By the way, these were supposed to be designed the last 50 to 75 years.
[02:15:35.846 --> 02:15:37.847]  Before the roads even opened, they're failing.
[02:15:38.752 --> 02:15:45.836]  So, minimally, we need some kind of oversight beyond the authority of TxDOT or CAMPO to straighten this huge mess out.
[02:15:45.916 --> 02:15:53.000]  I'm horrified to think that we're going to pay through the nose for these giant controlled grids that are likely to fall apart as we're driving on them.
[02:15:53.101 --> 02:15:54.381]  It reminds me of the Big Dig.
[02:15:54.401 --> 02:16:02.446]  Now, of course, we know George Shultz's company, Bechtel, who is getting all the military contracts, no-bid contracts, contracts even for Katrina, very quietly.
[02:16:02.706 --> 02:16:03.487]  Not like Halliburton.
[02:16:03.527 --> 02:16:08.630]  Very loudly, very quietly, George Shultz and Bechtel get just as many, if not more, contracts in Halliburton.
[02:16:08.890 --> 02:16:09.931]  And we remember the Big Dig.
[02:16:09.951 --> 02:16:11.232]  You know, I lived up in the Northeast.
[02:16:11.272 --> 02:16:13.173]  I've driven through the Big Dig.
[02:16:13.493 --> 02:16:18.677]  And it was just a massive mess, just like what we're going to see now with the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[02:16:18.957 --> 02:16:21.439]  A mess that was falling apart before they could finish it.
[02:16:21.739 --> 02:16:23.340]  Literally putting holes in the dike.
[02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:24.901]  This goes underneath water.
[02:16:25.221 --> 02:16:26.182]  So it's leaking.
[02:16:26.562 --> 02:16:28.443]  They went over budget by something like 500%.
[02:16:28.744 --> 02:16:31.986]  It cost them an extra 12 billion dollars.
[02:16:32.306 --> 02:16:34.467]  And they're still trying to patch it up and fix it.
[02:16:34.708 --> 02:16:36.669]  It's a giant piece of crap!
[02:16:38.877 --> 02:16:40.057]  Don't have a heart attack, Jack.
[02:16:40.077 --> 02:16:41.038]  This isn't the show for that.
[02:16:41.058 --> 02:16:42.198]  We don't get excited here.
[02:16:42.398 --> 02:16:42.718]  I know.
[02:16:42.738 --> 02:16:46.360]  No, we should all be horrified and terrified by this.
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.361]  And folks, Jack has had this for weeks.
[02:16:48.941 --> 02:16:50.201]  I've been looking over it.
[02:16:50.241 --> 02:16:51.562]  I've been begging him to go public.
[02:16:52.122 --> 02:16:58.484]  And now this, now your source, now this individual is finally ready for you to spill this because he's saying, hey, I got to do these tests.
[02:16:58.524 --> 02:16:59.325]  I can't falsify them.
[02:16:59.345 --> 02:17:02.046]  They're like, you can get fired or worse, buddy.
[02:17:02.586 --> 02:17:03.826]  And so he's starting to realize.
[02:17:04.587 --> 02:17:07.168]  So when he was finally ready to go public, I want to hear what he said to you.
[02:17:07.188 --> 02:17:07.988]  He said he was frantic.
[02:17:08.568 --> 02:17:09.189]  And we have them.
[02:17:09.209 --> 02:17:10.449]  These are the official TxDOT.
[02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:20.196]  Listen, I've been sent TxDOT documents a few years ago where it showed the computer screens hooked into Texas Department of Public Safety where it calls our driver's license number, the national ID card.
[02:17:21.142 --> 02:17:24.124]  And here's the guy in there, shooting video on the computer screens.
[02:17:25.185 --> 02:17:29.468]  And that's what these emergency management centers are, these command centers, federalizing your police.
[02:17:29.788 --> 02:17:31.289]  These are the citadels of evil.
[02:17:31.329 --> 02:17:32.530]  These are the command bases.
[02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:35.432]  The slave lord command bases.
[02:17:35.452 --> 02:17:39.254]  So these dark lords can just sit up there and rape the daylights out of you.
[02:17:40.235 --> 02:17:42.397]  We'll come back and get into this in great detail.
[02:17:42.417 --> 02:17:42.877]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.306 --> 02:17:52.668]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:17:52.888 --> 02:17:57.910]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:06.133]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:18:06.293 --> 02:18:13.316]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:18:13.536 --> 02:18:14.757]  There are no side effects.

[02:18:18.361 --> 02:18:19.482]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:18:19.763 --> 02:18:21.044]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:18:21.244 --> 02:18:28.091]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:18:33.836 --> 02:18:34.837]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:18:34.897 --> 02:18:36.158]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:36.178 --> 02:18:36.779]  One and the same.
[02:18:36.799 --> 02:18:38.260]  If you have deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1%,
[02:18:59.716 --> 02:19:05.198]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.618 --> 02:19:08.739]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:08.999 --> 02:19:10.820]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:13.921]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:14.461 --> 02:19:16.682]  Here is reality.
[02:19:17.042 --> 02:19:20.623]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:21.123 --> 02:19:24.764]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:25.345 --> 02:19:28.166]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[02:19:29.508 --> 02:19:33.230]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[02:19:49.202 --> 02:19:52.084]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:19:52.304 --> 02:19:58.509]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:21:42.436 --> 02:21:51.398]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.078 --> 02:21:54.459]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.859 --> 02:22:05.781]  Folks, when you get involved in exposing corruption, it's terrifying, it's exhilarating, it's dynamic, and I love the passion that Jack has for this.
[02:22:05.841 --> 02:22:06.962]  And we're here with the documents.
[02:22:06.982 --> 02:22:08.682]  We're here with the certified originals.
[02:22:09.412 --> 02:22:10.492]  I mean, these aren't copies.
[02:22:11.213 --> 02:22:17.055]  And we're in here with them looking at just hundreds of these tests that have failed.
[02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:23.637]  And folks, when roads start failing a few months after they're built, when this is being done, what were these companies thinking?
[02:22:23.717 --> 02:22:27.479]  Number one, and when you were talking to him, Jack, you said he was frantic.
[02:22:28.019 --> 02:22:29.640]  You've been talking to him for a year.
[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:32.581]  And number three, how dangerous is he?
[02:22:32.701 --> 02:22:35.562]  And I'm sure you asked, what can happen if this is going on?
[02:22:36.573 --> 02:22:39.496]  Well, thankfully he is a big believer in the Second Amendment.
[02:22:40.497 --> 02:22:41.258]  Let me just say that.
[02:22:41.338 --> 02:22:42.800]  So I think he feels rather safe.
[02:22:43.975 --> 02:22:54.083]  As far as that goes, look, this is very dangerous, because when we're talking about costing tech stock billions of dollars, sending people to jail, there are a number of... Well, what we're doing right now, we're dealing with a mob here.
[02:22:54.423 --> 02:22:55.464]  This is dangerous, folks.
[02:22:55.524 --> 02:22:56.125]  You better believe it.
[02:22:56.145 --> 02:22:57.666]  This makes Silkwood look like a joke.
[02:22:57.906 --> 02:23:04.932]  And we haven't even shown you nothing, because I could right now out companies that have contracted... You have all the documents.
[02:23:04.952 --> 02:23:09.155]  ...with tech stock and show a massive... It's kind of dangerous to have those and not out them, right?
[02:23:09.335 --> 02:23:11.497]  We have copies in secure places.
[02:23:11.717 --> 02:23:16.462]  You know, Alex, if they take me out or you out, more people will continue with this work.
[02:23:17.382 --> 02:23:20.745]  I really feel very confident that we can go forward with this.
[02:23:20.765 --> 02:23:23.688]  I hope listeners realize what they're hearing.
[02:23:23.708 --> 02:23:27.772]  I hope they realize that every day we're covering massive corruption stories.
[02:23:28.252 --> 02:23:38.139]  Frontline that we're originally reporting the Cheney reconstruction of the shooting that we did, what you're breaking right now, I mean just all of it is original sourced documentation.
[02:23:38.379 --> 02:23:44.143]  I mean this is, I'm not bragging, this is stuff people get Pulitzers for, but again the establishment gives you a Pulitzer for writing garbage.
[02:23:44.915 --> 02:23:48.218]  Well let me tell you Alex, this is the first time anybody's ever heard this.
[02:23:48.558 --> 02:23:50.640]  I haven't gone to the mainstream media with this yet.
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:52.441]  We haven't gone to the legislator with this yet.
[02:23:52.981 --> 02:23:54.442]  We will be doing this next week.
[02:23:54.483 --> 02:23:58.606]  So this is the first time anybody has ever heard this is on your program today.
[02:23:58.626 --> 02:24:04.991]  And when I heard Sal in earlier, you know, making what a great point he made about why we would want to pay for our own slavery.
[02:24:05.231 --> 02:24:10.775]  Why we would want to get involved in something that's going to cost us more money to take a road trip.
[02:24:11.536 --> 02:24:14.018]  It's very difficult for them to con us
[02:24:14.578 --> 02:24:18.720]  With this propaganda, basically, to have us even buy into this.
[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:24.423]  And it's only because of the massive apathy that people just go, oh, well, whatever, I can't do anything about it.
[02:24:24.463 --> 02:24:30.487]  I'll pay the extra 17 cents a mile and the surcharges and the local taxes and the government taxes and the state taxes.
[02:24:30.767 --> 02:24:35.169]  In fact, I'll just go ahead and deposit my check right into the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:24:35.189 --> 02:24:40.432]  I'll get a microchip, and when I'm driving through the toll road, it'll scan my chip and take money right out of my bank account.
[02:24:40.532 --> 02:24:42.172]  By the way, let's get into that.
[02:24:42.272 --> 02:24:44.713]  You've got the documents on this huge military road.
[02:24:44.733 --> 02:24:46.033]  10-Laner.
[02:24:46.373 --> 02:24:48.394]  Yeah, actually I don't have the documents on that, Alex.
[02:24:48.434 --> 02:24:53.955]  I mean, this is a lot of what I'm going to have to say, because again, I mean, this is no different than the Judith Miller case.
[02:24:53.975 --> 02:24:55.915]  Well, you do have the documents on the 10-Laner.
[02:24:56.415 --> 02:24:57.215]  Not on the military.
[02:24:57.255 --> 02:24:59.176]  I don't have those documents.
[02:24:59.216 --> 02:25:00.056]  There really aren't documents.
[02:25:00.076 --> 02:25:02.156]  Specifically, what did he tell you about that then?
[02:25:02.977 --> 02:25:04.217]  They're taking bids for it right now.
[02:25:04.357 --> 02:25:04.997]  They're going to build it.
[02:25:05.876 --> 02:25:07.197]  Now again, it's not illegal.
[02:25:07.497 --> 02:25:10.140]  Is it illegal for the military on the private land?
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:15.625]  And when you get into eminent domain, you get into what the... I mean, because look, if we can take people... But what is it for?
[02:25:15.685 --> 02:25:17.506]  We already have more roads than anybody in Texas.
[02:25:17.987 --> 02:25:19.788]  It's a military-only road.
[02:25:19.808 --> 02:25:20.929]  Let's ask that question.
[02:25:21.350 --> 02:25:22.050]  What is it for?
[02:25:22.310 --> 02:25:27.735]  Why does the military need to move massive machinery from Dallas to San Antonio?
[02:25:27.755 --> 02:25:30.918]  We know the Defense Department will just let their buddies use it for commerce.
[02:25:31.781 --> 02:25:46.686]  I think what they're doing is building massive military roads throughout the United States, military-use only roads, because they do not want the public to see them moving massive tanks and machinery and biochemical trucks through the public domain.
[02:25:46.886 --> 02:25:47.786]  They want to hide that.
[02:25:47.806 --> 02:25:57.150]  So they're going to build guarded, shielded, giant superhighways, ten-line superhighways, to move this apparatus and this machinery around without the public knowing.
[02:25:57.210 --> 02:25:58.950]  Lord knows what they've built out at Hood.
[02:25:58.990 --> 02:26:01.111]  They admit that's one of the biggest underground bases in the country.
[02:26:01.917 --> 02:26:03.419]  So again, is that illegal?
[02:26:03.499 --> 02:26:05.200]  I guess we can take that apart.
[02:26:05.641 --> 02:26:12.107]  The fact is, I know the source that is putting a bid on this highway.
[02:26:12.147 --> 02:26:13.389]  They're going to build this highway.
[02:26:13.509 --> 02:26:18.414]  You were saying he was scared when he was talking to you just about the concrete failing.
[02:26:18.814 --> 02:26:20.736]  What else was he saying?
[02:26:22.119 --> 02:26:24.759]  Well, I've pretty much put the cards on the table for right now.
[02:26:24.779 --> 02:26:26.380]  I mean, this is what I can tell you today.
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:28.120]  Like I said, I'm not getting in.
[02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:34.001]  I mean, what we could do right now on your show is I could give specific names of companies that are forging these documents.
[02:26:34.441 --> 02:26:35.361]  Do we understand?
[02:26:35.381 --> 02:26:50.704]  Because I've told this to one or two people besides your audience today, Alex, and I don't think people fully understand the ramifications of all of the concrete being mixed in a substandard manner for these giant roads going in all around us.
[02:26:51.184 --> 02:26:52.744]  I mean, I think that that's very damning.
[02:26:52.764 --> 02:26:56.785]  And look, what I'm going to be calling for is a massive investigation into this.
[02:26:56.845 --> 02:26:58.526]  Now, I've got the tip of the iceberg.
[02:26:58.546 --> 02:27:01.186]  We're going to be able to add more layers onto this as we go.
[02:27:01.366 --> 02:27:12.329]  But right now, what we have, Alex, if we had an honest legislator in our government, if we had an honest governor, if we had an honest media, this would be above the fold, front page news by Monday morning.
[02:27:13.883 --> 02:27:19.747]  Well, it should be, and we'll see if the statesman and others contact you and want to publish these documents.
[02:27:19.787 --> 02:27:21.748]  We'll see what happens.
[02:27:21.768 --> 02:27:28.292]  We'll come back, get more into this, and recap it, cover a few other issues with it, and then we'll get into a whole host of other news.
[02:27:28.312 --> 02:27:29.533]  I know we've had loaded phones all day.
[02:27:29.553 --> 02:27:31.494]  I don't even know if we'll be able to get to your calls.
[02:27:31.514 --> 02:27:32.715]  We may jam a few in.
[02:27:36.057 --> 02:27:36.957]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.438 --> 02:27:39.059]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.959 --> 02:27:42.641]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.839 --> 02:27:47.320]  Hey folks, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:51.601]  You've all heard me on the radio talking about the importance of investing in precious metals.
[02:27:52.001 --> 02:27:55.503]  I feel it's time for me to talk about the importance of investing in your health.
[02:27:55.883 --> 02:27:59.444]  I was presented with the opportunity to try Tri-Vibes from TriVortex.
[02:27:59.844 --> 02:28:04.686]  I was a bit hesitant of the idea of absorbing vitamins by wearing them rather than ingesting them.
[02:28:05.026 --> 02:28:10.828]  After conducting one of the tests found at TriVortex.com, I was convinced that the product might actually work.
[02:28:11.128 --> 02:28:14.849]  I now wear my TriVibes bands daily, and I'm feeling better than ever.
[02:28:15.189 --> 02:28:17.270]  Not only physically, but also mentally.
[02:28:17.610 --> 02:28:23.372]  TriVortex also offers amazingly beneficial and beautiful jewelry worn by the women around the office daily.
[02:28:23.792 --> 02:28:24.974]  TriVortex is amazing.
[02:28:25.314 --> 02:28:26.435]  Don't take my word for it.
[02:28:26.515 --> 02:28:31.922]  Try TriVortex yourself and have fun and learn with the test found on TriVortex.com.
[02:28:32.142 --> 02:28:35.586]  That's T-R-I-V-O-R-T-E-X dot com.

[02:28:48.361 --> 02:28:48.841]  are located?
[02:28:49.061 --> 02:28:52.443]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:29:44.127 --> 02:29:45.208]  You don't love me anymore?
[02:29:45.548 --> 02:29:47.349]  You used to take such good care of me.
[02:29:47.669 --> 02:29:48.830]  Is that my car talking to me?
[02:29:48.990 --> 02:29:49.270]  Yes.
[02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:50.430]  You neglect me.
[02:29:50.591 --> 02:29:52.572]  Change my oil late most of the time.
[02:29:54.393 --> 02:29:55.413]  Use the cheapest gas.
[02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:56.614]  I'm getting sick.
[02:29:56.954 --> 02:29:59.135]  One of these days, I'm just gonna give up.
[02:30:00.176 --> 02:30:00.676]  Wait a minute.
[02:30:00.756 --> 02:30:02.337]  I've got three more years of payments on you.
[02:30:02.357 --> 02:30:11.142]  If you want me to last forever, you need to add protected engine treatment, protected transmission treatment, and especially protected complete fuel system treatment.
[02:30:11.602 --> 02:30:17.090]  Protecta's unique synthetic fortifiers treat the metal and the oil to reduce friction like no other.
[02:30:17.331 --> 02:30:19.754]  Okay, I'll add some Protecta, but you'll have to perform.
[02:30:19.854 --> 02:30:21.737]  How about faster acceleration?
[02:30:22.077 --> 02:30:23.179]  More horsepower?
[02:30:23.439 --> 02:30:24.541]  Longer lasting?
[02:30:24.741 --> 02:30:26.304]  I'll always be there for you.
[02:30:26.604 --> 02:30:29.905]  So if you want more, treat it right with Protecta by SFR.

[02:30:56.583 --> 02:31:06.829]  Alright, we just learned that David Stahl has been a guest here and of course a police officer and then a city councilman and he's a city manager and a city manager in several cities.
[02:31:06.869 --> 02:31:09.291]  He's down in Houston in the town of Shore Acres.
[02:31:10.286 --> 02:31:16.672]  And he's gotten the majority of the counties to sign on to his Corridor Watch organization.
[02:31:17.392 --> 02:31:19.714]  And so he's on the front lines of this fight.
[02:31:19.754 --> 02:31:22.317]  We're honored to have him call in with us.
[02:31:22.597 --> 02:31:25.640]  And he was listening to Jack's presentation.
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:27.081]  Jack Blood, GCN Radio host.
[02:31:27.641 --> 02:31:46.893]  Who is joining us here in studio and we were talking about during the break I'd like to repeat the discussion we had during that last three-minute break off-air where David you were saying that you talked to legislators and they've said on the dais that oh yeah since this is private we don't have to follow state law.
[02:31:46.913 --> 02:31:50.415]  Well they're still building code laws and so they're fully aware of this.
[02:31:50.855 --> 02:31:51.796]  David get into this for us.
[02:31:52.649 --> 02:31:58.374]  Actually, that's how the Transportation Commission at one point even described innovation.
[02:31:58.774 --> 02:32:01.516]  We've been pressing them, what's innovative about building roads and railroads?
[02:32:01.536 --> 02:32:02.697]  We've been doing that a hundred years.
[02:32:03.458 --> 02:32:14.106]  And Chairman Williamson in one of the meetings said that the innovation was that these private partners don't have to comply with the same laws that the state would, which is scary.
[02:32:14.126 --> 02:32:18.330]  You know, they're not going to comply with the things that were put in place to protect the public.
[02:32:20.727 --> 02:32:22.108]  They can claim they're above the law.
[02:32:22.148 --> 02:32:24.810]  It's like this deal with Centra on taking over the roads for toll roads.
[02:32:24.850 --> 02:32:31.914]  They say, we don't have to make any part of our plan in a state agreement public because we're private so it's confidential.
[02:32:31.994 --> 02:32:33.895]  And the Attorney General says, no you have to.
[02:32:33.935 --> 02:32:35.076]  And they say, we're not going to do it.
[02:32:35.636 --> 02:32:41.380]  Yeah, and what this is, this is TxDOT using what they think is a loophole so they can operate in the dark.
[02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:44.362]  So they can do things without public participation.
[02:32:44.975 --> 02:32:47.016]  We don't know what we're buying, and we don't know what we're paying for.
[02:32:47.156 --> 02:33:02.185]  David, I'm looking at the official documents, the official reports, the official test, where they're showing that the concrete made out of the limestone is failing just in a few months, failing massively, falling apart on these big bridges and roads.
[02:33:02.585 --> 02:33:04.846]  I'm looking at the documents and talking to you during the break.
[02:33:04.886 --> 02:33:05.927]  You said, oh yeah, they know that.
[02:33:06.887 --> 02:33:07.428]  Yeah, sure.
[02:33:07.448 --> 02:33:08.168]  Of course they do.
[02:33:08.188 --> 02:33:09.869]  Of course they do.
[02:33:10.595 --> 02:33:14.921]  They know exactly what's going on, and they're also playing a lot of games now with SH-130.
[02:33:15.521 --> 02:33:20.548]  They'll say it's part of the Trans-Texas Corridor one day, and they'll say it's not part of the Trans-Texas Corridor the next.
[02:33:21.008 --> 02:33:22.951]  Whichever allows them, they'll use a loophole.
[02:33:22.971 --> 02:33:26.475]  As a matter of fact, they have documents that have been printed that are available.
[02:33:26.515 --> 02:33:29.399]  You can find them that they've recalled and reissued.
[02:33:30.274 --> 02:33:32.677]  Just doing a complete substitution shell game with the public.
[02:33:32.837 --> 02:33:41.589]  Well, this sounds like the way Enron and Arthur Anderson did business between each other, and now... I mean, where does it go from here, David Stahl?
[02:33:42.169 --> 02:33:45.334]  Well, it goes to the point that it ultimately collapses.
[02:33:45.874 --> 02:33:46.976]  This is a shell game.
[02:33:47.416 --> 02:33:48.518]  You know what this reminds me of?
[02:33:48.758 --> 02:34:00.592]  This reminds me of in the 80s, the S&L crisis, but a part of that equation, and I grew up in Rockwall, Texas, outside Dallas, they built literally tens of thousands of apartments and condos that were falling apart.
[02:34:00.613 --> 02:34:01.694]  This is not an exaggeration.
[02:34:03.182 --> 02:34:07.485]  that were falling apart before they were even done.
[02:34:07.505 --> 02:34:08.786]  By the way, the Bushes were involved.
[02:34:09.166 --> 02:34:13.849]  I mean, the size of the buildings were falling down before they even opened, but it didn't matter.
[02:34:13.869 --> 02:34:22.996]  They'd already gotten the loan to build it and already sold it to somebody else, and it was all just about getting a hold of the cash flow, and like the Mafia, not even trying to build anything.
[02:34:23.036 --> 02:34:24.937]  David, comment on that, and I want to get Jack Blood to comment.
[02:34:24.977 --> 02:34:26.178]  Yeah, I think you're exactly right.
[02:34:26.218 --> 02:34:29.621]  It's all how the agreements are structured, and since those are secret, we don't know.
[02:34:29.981 --> 02:34:34.347]  They may in fact get paid to build it and they may get paid to fix it after they've built it substandard.
[02:34:34.728 --> 02:34:37.372]  And then they get paid to operate it and we get to pay for all of it.
[02:34:38.253 --> 02:34:41.237]  And so that's how they get $500,000 a thousand times over budget?
[02:34:41.578 --> 02:34:42.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:34:44.182 --> 02:34:46.405]  Jack Blood, I tell you, it just gets deeper and deeper.
[02:34:46.886 --> 02:34:50.570]  Can we scan some of these documents in after the show and get them up on InfoWars.com?
[02:34:50.590 --> 02:34:55.476]  Yeah, I think the best thing to do to keep everybody safe is to get these out in public as soon as we can.
[02:34:55.496 --> 02:34:59.121]  And then as soon as we've done that, your webmaster will mirror them at JackBlood.com.
[02:34:59.381 --> 02:35:02.225]  And then I guess, David Stahl, you'll mirror them at CorridorWatch.org?
[02:35:02.685 --> 02:35:03.505]  Sure, I'd be happy to.
[02:35:03.645 --> 02:35:06.767]  The key is to get this everywhere or we will get big problems.
[02:35:06.907 --> 02:35:10.268]  This all reminds me a little bit, too, of the reconstruction in Iraq.
[02:35:10.308 --> 02:35:13.109]  I mean, we're supposed to jump up and down because they're building a new school.
[02:35:13.129 --> 02:35:16.371]  Well, they bombed all the schools and they're building a few schools, so what?
[02:35:16.791 --> 02:35:24.534]  And I think you really hit the nail on the head when you talked about how you can get a hold of loans, how you can get leverage over a big project like this.
[02:35:24.774 --> 02:35:31.037]  Who cares if the project actually works out and people can actually drive on it and it's actually good and it will relieve traffic congestion?
[02:35:31.057 --> 02:35:31.837]  They don't care about that.
[02:35:31.957 --> 02:35:37.199]  Yeah, they're busy buying defense contractor stock with it, movie theater change, and they're busy buying sports teams.
[02:35:37.699 --> 02:35:48.443]  I mean, for all we know, they've got giant semis out on the road that can cause massive congestion, so we'll all line up and say, please stop the congestion, we'll pay you anything.
[02:35:48.463 --> 02:35:52.124]  Oh, by the way, Arnold last year, Schwarzenegger, ordered him to tear up a whole road the night before.
[02:35:52.144 --> 02:35:55.745]  It was perfect condition, so he could come say, look how bad the roads are, I need more funding.
[02:35:56.573 --> 02:35:57.854]  Well, look how bad the roads are.
[02:35:57.894 --> 02:36:01.236]  We need to do something about illegal immigration, but that's a whole nother issue.
[02:36:02.037 --> 02:36:14.785]  So what you're getting at, Alex, I think is an extremely poignant point that I'd like to put into my analysis, and that is there could be a giant, as you say, Enron-type scandal here where it has nothing to do with providing energy.
[02:36:14.845 --> 02:36:16.226]  I don't think there could be.
[02:36:16.246 --> 02:36:17.706]  We've proven that that's what it is.
[02:36:17.746 --> 02:36:18.087]  It is.
[02:36:18.107 --> 02:36:19.708]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:36:21.158 --> 02:36:27.724]  Yeah, there's some documentation from some bonding entities internationally that are
[02:36:28.072 --> 02:36:31.813]  They're saying, be very wary of how this is all being structured and financed.
[02:36:31.893 --> 02:36:36.895]  That's right, because we have the company they've hired to certify, who is well known in almost every case.
[02:36:37.535 --> 02:36:41.636]  Earlier examples, you know, they say the toll road will make $9 million, it really makes $9 million.
[02:36:43.757 --> 02:36:45.397]  So there's scam on top of scam.
[02:36:45.837 --> 02:36:52.659]  Yeah, and every indication is as long as they can keep getting new participants and suck new money into it, they can keep kiting this scheme.
[02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:54.260]  But at the point that it collapses,
[02:36:54.781 --> 02:36:56.503]  You know, then everybody's going to be holding the bag.
[02:36:56.643 --> 02:36:58.024]  So, i.e., Ponzi scheme?
[02:36:58.184 --> 02:36:59.005]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:36:59.225 --> 02:37:09.735]  And people should be aware that this is going on all over the country, and if they're building something in your city, you can pretty much be sure that they're fudging the records, that they're not, you know, building the apparatus of the code.
[02:37:09.755 --> 02:37:10.355]  But here's the thing.
[02:37:10.375 --> 02:37:11.797]  We have a former city council member.
[02:37:11.837 --> 02:37:13.879]  We have a former city council member, Ron.
[02:37:14.539 --> 02:37:16.001]  He's been a city manager in two cities.
[02:37:16.641 --> 02:37:19.504]  He's at the forefront of the fight here in Texas on this.
[02:37:20.444 --> 02:37:21.925]  I've studied this in the past.
[02:37:22.405 --> 02:37:26.207]  Even mafia organizations in Boston and New York didn't do stuff this shoddy.
[02:37:26.907 --> 02:37:30.229]  David Stahl, why are they just acting like the world's going to end tomorrow?
[02:37:30.449 --> 02:37:32.790]  I mean, they're going overboard like no one's ever seen.
[02:37:33.350 --> 02:37:37.032]  Yeah, they are, and it's just about money and turning it over quickly.
[02:37:37.552 --> 02:37:43.195]  They can't stay in power and in control forever, and they know that, and they've got to make the best of it while they can.
[02:37:43.635 --> 02:37:47.317]  And with people like myself running for the State Senate, the time is running out.
[02:37:48.448 --> 02:37:49.591]  And you're wildly popular.
[02:37:49.611 --> 02:37:56.225]  Well, David Stahl, we're going to get some of these documents posted, and I hope that they'll be useful, and I want to commend Jack for what he's done exposing this.
[02:37:57.503 --> 02:37:59.204]  So, David Stahl, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:37:59.384 --> 02:38:00.064]  Thank you for having me.
[02:38:00.084 --> 02:38:00.664]  Go get them, David.
[02:38:00.684 --> 02:38:01.225]  All right.
[02:38:01.605 --> 02:38:02.485]  That's right, go get them.
[02:38:03.265 --> 02:38:04.426]  Boy, this has been a wild show today.
[02:38:04.466 --> 02:38:06.287]  I mean, I didn't even intend today to be the big toll show.
[02:38:06.687 --> 02:38:14.330]  And then, meanwhile, I have this Dick Cheney video that's uploaded to the server, and then it gets erased down off the server.
[02:38:14.370 --> 02:38:17.571]  We've confirmed that over and over again, so we're having to put it on multiple servers.
[02:38:17.591 --> 02:38:20.672]  I want to spend a few minutes on that, because when we first came on, you were bringing it up.
[02:38:21.033 --> 02:38:22.953]  You've seen the video before it was taken down again.
[02:38:22.973 --> 02:38:24.174]  Now we've got it back up again.
[02:38:24.954 --> 02:38:28.979]  On Infowars.com, and I want to thank some of the locals that have helped us get that back up.
[02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:42.134]  Please tell us, Jack, I mean, you watch the video, the reenactment showing that Cheney shot Mr. Whittington at 15 to 18 feet, not 90 feet as he said, and why that's important.
[02:38:42.214 --> 02:38:44.156]  This is the smoking gun, pun intended.
[02:38:44.176 --> 02:38:44.937]  Folks, we're not hyping it.
[02:38:44.977 --> 02:38:45.838]  This is the smoking gun.
[02:38:46.590 --> 02:38:49.091]  Well, I like how you shot your dummy, what's his name, Bob?
[02:38:49.411 --> 02:38:51.712]  And the pellets actually just bounced off of him.
[02:38:52.472 --> 02:38:55.913]  Really, why is it up to us to do these tests?
[02:38:55.953 --> 02:38:58.014]  Why isn't the Sheriff's Department doing this?
[02:38:58.074 --> 02:38:59.234]  Why isn't the Justice Department?
[02:38:59.254 --> 02:39:03.516]  Why isn't somebody who was paid to do these types of investigations doing it?
[02:39:03.536 --> 02:39:04.936]  It's the same thing with 9-11, Alex.
[02:39:04.956 --> 02:39:13.319]  I mean, here we are, underfunded, under-manned, under-staffed, very little time, and we've got to go out and do these field tests in order to set the record straight.
[02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:18.550]  And we had a former NASA contractor, I mean he's a literal rocket scientist there.
[02:39:18.570 --> 02:39:19.750]  We had a police officer there.
[02:39:19.770 --> 02:39:21.490]  We did it with tape measures, scientifically.
[02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:25.491]  We shot a Cornish game hen, a watermelon, which are good for simulating this.
[02:39:25.531 --> 02:39:28.152]  We also shot targets to show the spread.
[02:39:28.172 --> 02:39:34.813]  The spread was from 6 to 8 feet at 90 feet with the very same shotgun and the very same load that Dick Cheney was using.
[02:39:35.073 --> 02:39:38.594]  But then Whittington has a foot pattern, I kept saying 14 inches, it was a 12 inch pattern.
[02:39:39.054 --> 02:39:39.694]  Uh, tightly.
[02:39:39.714 --> 02:39:41.975]  Uh, you're talking, uh, 15 to 18 feet.
[02:39:42.015 --> 02:39:47.617]  We then did that test and showed how at 15 to 18 feet, that's the results we got, not the 90 feet.
[02:39:47.917 --> 02:39:53.979]  And it shows why Dick Cheney covered up, because if he's shooting him at 15 feet, I mean, there's no excuse for this.
[02:39:54.039 --> 02:39:55.739]  I mean, how did he shoot Whittington at 15 feet?
[02:39:55.939 --> 02:39:59.020]  Pretty clear, he fell over, the gun discharged, something else happened.
[02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:01.601]  The official story has been disproved.
[02:40:01.861 --> 02:40:02.221]  Proven.
[02:40:02.261 --> 02:40:03.642]  And they don't want you to see it, folks.
[02:40:03.862 --> 02:40:06.362]  It's on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:40:06.442 --> 02:40:10.484]  They do not, and notice all the so-called liberal media is attacking him on petty issues.
[02:40:10.504 --> 02:40:15.585]  You'd think they would jump on this, but we wrote articles about this on Monday and Tuesday when all of this came out.
[02:40:15.825 --> 02:40:19.246]  They've got millions of readers, but the mainstream media won't touch it, Jack.
[02:40:19.286 --> 02:40:20.447]  We have Dick Cheney.
[02:40:20.547 --> 02:40:21.907]  We have him.
[02:40:21.967 --> 02:40:25.008]  And they closed the investigation last night with the Kennedy Sheriff's Department.
[02:40:25.487 --> 02:40:30.931]  Chris Matthews has done every show this week, a full one hour program on this subject.
[02:40:30.971 --> 02:40:31.752]  But guess what Alex?
[02:40:31.952 --> 02:40:36.676]  He doesn't talk about how could Cheney have shot from 30 yards or from 15 feet.
[02:40:36.756 --> 02:40:43.101]  He doesn't mention how could the BB have penetrated the heart of Mr. Whittington, who by the way is going public today.
[02:40:43.161 --> 02:40:46.244]  I believe Whittington is going to be on Fox News making some statements today.
[02:40:46.744 --> 02:40:54.549]  Look, what I think is because of your report, because of your investigation, we're going to start to see the details change, just like in 9-11, Alex.
[02:40:54.809 --> 02:41:05.616]  The excuses are going to morph into, oh well, we meant to say, and to the best of our recollection, and the story is now going to begin to change because of the diagnostic that you did.
[02:41:06.801 --> 02:41:08.242]  And it was scientifically conducted.
[02:41:08.262 --> 02:41:12.103]  Understand, different BBs in the mass of a 28-gauge go at different speeds.
[02:41:12.143 --> 02:41:18.186]  So if you went in a millimeter or two into the chicken or into the watermelon, that's not even down to the rib cage.
[02:41:18.606 --> 02:41:24.749]  But most of them, we put two shirts on the dummy, two thin, long-sleeved shirts on the kickboxing dummy.
[02:41:25.009 --> 02:41:26.770]  Bob, it's made of soft latex, okay?
[02:41:26.830 --> 02:41:28.431]  In fact, they use it in some ballistics tests.
[02:41:28.611 --> 02:41:30.912]  It's very similar to some of the ballistics gelatin they use.
[02:41:31.252 --> 02:41:32.052]  We even looked that up.
[02:41:32.472 --> 02:41:36.094]  And we're shooting it, and the BBs would, most of them, stuck in the shirt.
[02:41:36.654 --> 02:41:40.636]  They didn't even put indentations into the soft latex.
[02:41:40.996 --> 02:41:51.481]  And then many were right on the surface, just not even halfway in with the back side out, and I just reached with my fingers and was pulling them out on the videotape, and that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:41:51.782 --> 02:41:52.422]  And listen,
[02:41:53.141 --> 02:41:56.522]  Take Chris Matthews and his show on CNBC, Hardball.
[02:41:56.903 --> 02:42:15.730]  Right now, they can call, before he's on in a few hours, they can call, or they can have him ready for tomorrow night, they can call a New York retired cop who testifies in forensics, and they have hundreds of cops that do this for a living as court experts, or they can call one of the crime labs, they can go out to a shooting range, and they can hang up a side of beef.
[02:42:16.270 --> 02:42:20.591]  And they can shoot it 30 yards with a 7.5 birdshot and a 2.75 inch shotgun shell.
[02:42:20.871 --> 02:42:26.153]  And they can shoot it, and they can dig it out, and they can sit there and show people how deep it went and how it's impossible.
[02:42:26.333 --> 02:42:27.613]  They can show the pattern spread.
[02:42:27.633 --> 02:42:28.833]  They can do this in a few hours.
[02:42:28.853 --> 02:42:31.554]  I mean, I've only got a few employees that work on the video end.
[02:42:31.874 --> 02:42:38.836]  We got up early, we went out there, we shot the video, we edited it, we put it up on the website for everybody to see, for everybody to understand what had happened.
[02:42:40.023 --> 02:42:52.550]  Well, look, part of the reason that Chris Matthews is covering this is because the pool reporters, the Washington establishment media was upset that they were usurped by a local newspaper here in Texas.
[02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:54.531]  They are the ultimate gatekeepers.
[02:42:54.551 --> 02:42:58.473]  They don't like people reporting things to their underlings.
[02:42:58.513 --> 02:43:01.174]  They want to be the ones that gatekeep all the information.
[02:43:01.395 --> 02:43:03.276]  So some of this is actually just personal.
[02:43:04.416 --> 02:43:05.117]  You know what's cool?
[02:43:05.177 --> 02:43:08.581]  We're on the Air America station down in Corpus Christi.
[02:43:08.601 --> 02:43:10.343]  We just got that affiliate about a month ago.
[02:43:10.483 --> 02:43:11.404]  They air us at night.
[02:43:11.885 --> 02:43:12.706]  I think from 7 to 10.
[02:43:13.006 --> 02:43:15.349]  We're very thankful for that affiliate down there.
[02:43:15.369 --> 02:43:18.192]  In fact, guys, you know my memory is not too good on affiliates.
[02:43:18.252 --> 02:43:18.873]  It's a new affiliate.
[02:43:19.193 --> 02:43:21.015]  Look that up so I can plug that affiliate.
[02:43:21.216 --> 02:43:24.760]  So it's kind of nice that we're even on in the town where all this is going on.
[02:43:25.396 --> 02:43:26.957]  Well, I wonder what the people down there think of you.
[02:43:26.977 --> 02:43:27.758]  Have you had a consensus?
[02:43:27.838 --> 02:43:43.170]  I mean, they have to... At this point, after five years of big-time Dick Cheney and George W., I think people have pretty much just assumed that they are above the law, that they are the dictators, that they are the totalitarian government, if you will, and they've almost accepted it.
[02:43:43.490 --> 02:43:44.931]  That's very unfortunate.
[02:43:44.951 --> 02:44:03.987]  What's more unfortunate is that, you know, here we are in the 2006 midterm elections, coming up in two years, we're going to be electing another ruler, another script reader, and people, when a Democrat gets in, whether it be Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden or whoever, they're going to go back to sleep and think that everything's now going to be okay because we got rid of the evil George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
[02:44:04.007 --> 02:44:10.172]  Oh, certainly, they're just puppets, but my point is it shows how they're above the law, and it shows how they told the police to come back in 13 and a half hours.
[02:44:10.632 --> 02:44:14.534]  And it shows how they told the public in 22 hours and they said Whittington hadn't been seriously hurt.
[02:44:14.754 --> 02:44:21.778]  When they knew day one he was heart shot, they had to catheterize his heart to get all the excess bleeding out of there because of pressurization that was causing him to have a heart attack.
[02:44:22.498 --> 02:44:28.001]  They had to wipe the blood off the dining room table to make sure they didn't think it was a hunting accident.
[02:44:28.281 --> 02:44:30.542]  If Cheney would have had to go through the rigorous
[02:44:31.182 --> 02:44:34.064]  Testing that we would have to go through if this happened to one of us.
[02:44:34.124 --> 02:44:37.326]  He would have blown into a tube and we would have found out that he was intoxicated.
[02:44:37.346 --> 02:44:40.348]  Well, we know that they covered up whatever happened out there.
[02:44:40.388 --> 02:44:51.735]  We know their official story is a lie, is a fraud, and this will show you how the media is just making this a big spectacle to divert us for the build-up to the Iran war instead of going right for the jugular and going, hey, wait a minute.
[02:44:52.055 --> 02:44:56.798]  Shotguns at 90 feet with this load cannot even, you know, go in an inch.
[02:44:56.978 --> 02:45:00.440]  This is a fraud and so many people haven't fired firearms.
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:07.990]  They think of a sniper in a movie firing a .308 out of a Remington 700 and shooting somebody at a thousand yards.
[02:45:08.390 --> 02:45:11.514]  Folks, that's a rifle high-velocity shell.
[02:45:11.895 --> 02:45:15.520]  Shotguns with birdshot are completely different.
[02:45:16.275 --> 02:45:18.097]  They have nothing to do with it.
[02:45:18.497 --> 02:45:22.641]  Shotguns with birdshot only go 30 to 40 yards.
[02:45:23.021 --> 02:45:28.746]  I have shot birds at 30 yards and you knock them out of the air and there's no pellets in them because they've lost their force.
[02:45:28.826 --> 02:45:30.347]  It just was like a punch to the bird.
[02:45:30.628 --> 02:45:32.109]  It hit the bird and knocked it down.
[02:45:32.169 --> 02:45:34.311]  The bird is still alive when you get over there.
[02:45:34.591 --> 02:45:37.633]  KCCT Corpus Christi at 1150 AM.
[02:45:37.653 --> 02:45:39.434]  I want to thank those folks.
[02:45:39.574 --> 02:45:41.175]  That is that affiliate down there.
[02:45:41.195 --> 02:45:47.119]  And that's really exciting to be able to just be so many places, getting so many new affiliates, signing up our broadcast.
[02:45:47.159 --> 02:45:49.521]  And Jack's coming up after this show ends.
[02:45:49.781 --> 02:45:52.423]  You know, there's so much other news we haven't even had a chance to cover.
[02:45:52.443 --> 02:45:54.644]  This Russell Tice, who we're going to be getting on the show.
[02:45:55.484 --> 02:46:00.688]  He goes and testifies, yeah, there's 50 agencies, 50 programs spying on everything you do, nothing to do with foreign calls.
[02:46:00.748 --> 02:46:04.250]  We already knew that, but here he's saying it, and that's not even major news.
[02:46:04.531 --> 02:46:04.891]  Comments.
[02:46:05.569 --> 02:46:09.971]  Well, it just came out today, Senate plans no probe of NSA spying program.
[02:46:09.991 --> 02:46:10.752]  I mean, doesn't that say it all?
[02:46:10.912 --> 02:46:13.713]  And Bush considers blogs the enemy and is having the Pentagon target him.
[02:46:13.953 --> 02:46:27.140]  Then rock star Henry Rollins is on an airplane reading an anti-jihad book that has jihad in the title, and they pull him off the plane and say, don't ever read a book like that again on the plane because the sheep saw the word jihad.
[02:46:28.220 --> 02:46:34.262]  What's funny about that story is I know Henry Rollins, and he has turned out to be one of the biggest neocons you'll ever know.
[02:46:34.302 --> 02:46:38.963]  He goes over on the USO tours, supports the troops, supports Bush, supports Clinton.
[02:46:39.083 --> 02:46:41.144]  Oh yeah, he's one of their little bootleggers.
[02:46:41.404 --> 02:46:43.084]  And see, he's starting to figure it out.
[02:46:43.124 --> 02:46:44.885]  He's reading a neocon book.
[02:46:45.485 --> 02:46:49.686]  He's reading a neocon book saying all the Arabs are Satan's children, basically.
[02:46:50.106 --> 02:46:52.847]  And he's reading this, and then, oh, he's finding out.
[02:46:53.767 --> 02:46:54.428]  He's reading a book.
[02:46:54.448 --> 02:46:55.488]  That means he's a terrorist.
[02:46:56.536 --> 02:47:02.021]  Well, if Henry Rollins is a terrorist, then I guess all the neocons are terrorists.
[02:47:02.361 --> 02:47:08.947]  At this point, after years and years and years of this, it's almost unimaginable how anyone could still fall for this.
[02:47:08.967 --> 02:47:13.391]  Hey, what's wrong with the Houston police chief saying if you want to build a new home in Houston, you have to have a camera in your home watching you?
[02:47:13.571 --> 02:47:15.072]  That is Associated Press!
[02:47:15.332 --> 02:47:16.954]  That is Houston Chronicle!
[02:47:17.134 --> 02:47:19.396]  Camera's in your house now!
[02:47:19.716 --> 02:47:20.417]  It's for your safety.
[02:47:20.437 --> 02:47:21.798]  You have nothing to hide, Alex.
[02:47:21.818 --> 02:47:22.618]  What are you worried about?
[02:47:22.679 --> 02:47:23.779]  Let's put cameras everywhere.
[02:47:23.799 --> 02:47:26.562]  Well, that's what the cops say for years, and they pull you over and go, I'm gonna search your car.
[02:47:26.662 --> 02:47:27.302]  Well, no, you can't.
[02:47:27.322 --> 02:47:28.183]  Well, what do you have to hide?
[02:47:28.523 --> 02:47:29.985]  And then next, I said it would happen.
[02:47:30.005 --> 02:47:33.287]  Now they go to your door in Dallas and say, we just want to search the house randomly.
[02:47:33.327 --> 02:47:34.448]  It's called knock and talk.
[02:47:34.468 --> 02:47:35.129]  It's a service.
[02:47:35.409 --> 02:47:36.230]  Well, no, you can't search.
[02:47:36.250 --> 02:47:37.711]  Well, what do you have to hide, ma'am?
[02:47:38.211 --> 02:47:38.932]  What do you have to hide?
[02:47:38.952 --> 02:47:43.576]  You know, try going to a cop's house and saying, well, statistically, you commit more crimes than the citizens.
[02:47:43.616 --> 02:47:46.178]  More alcoholism, more drug, more beatings, more shootings.
[02:47:46.678 --> 02:47:47.839]  Mind if we just search your house?
[02:47:47.879 --> 02:47:48.760]  You have nothing to hide, do you?
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:49.020]  Yeah.
[02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:52.541]  Well, what we have to hide is not that we're not law-abiding citizens.
[02:47:52.581 --> 02:47:58.503]  We might be law-abiding citizens, but with new laws coming out in the books every day, I mean, I smoke 15 feet from a door, I'm a felon.
[02:47:58.684 --> 02:48:01.385]  You know, if I have one drink and drive my car, I'm a felon.
[02:48:01.405 --> 02:48:04.626]  I mean, these days, most people aren't law-abiding, and they don't even know it.
[02:48:04.666 --> 02:48:06.286]  But here's the thing... Well, that's what tyranny is.
[02:48:06.346 --> 02:48:08.347]  It makes general, normal activity criminal.
[02:48:08.547 --> 02:48:10.028]  All criminals, all terrorists.
[02:48:10.088 --> 02:48:19.776]  And something we better remember is that when they do the knock and talk, or we let them search our car, and they see a constitution or a pocket constitution in your backseat... I had that on video, I filmed what's happening.
[02:48:19.816 --> 02:48:20.517]  You're a terrorist.
[02:48:20.797 --> 02:48:22.218]  They said she's got... You get on the watch list.
[02:48:22.318 --> 02:48:26.682]  They said she's got a constitution, she's got an Alex Jones video, she's a terrorist, we're taking her to jail.
[02:48:26.842 --> 02:48:27.903]  We have it from her squad car!
[02:48:28.815 --> 02:48:37.846]  See, we have FEMA training them to do this on tape, then we show you the cops in the field off their own squad car tape, so brainwashed that they think cameras in your house is good.
[02:48:38.347 --> 02:48:39.488]  They think Satan's good!
[02:48:47.378 --> 02:48:50.220]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:52.061]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:52.401 --> 02:48:57.064]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.425 --> 02:49:04.149]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:04.469 --> 02:49:06.449]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:09.490]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.610 --> 02:49:14.251]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.471 --> 02:49:18.872]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:19.112 --> 02:49:26.334]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:51:48.291 --> 02:51:54.333]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.934 --> 02:51:57.935]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:58.855 --> 02:52:00.536]  Well, Friday the 17th of 2006 on this February edition,
[02:52:05.043 --> 02:52:08.486]  This broadcast has just blown past us here.
[02:52:08.606 --> 02:52:11.309]  I'll be back Monday, of course, 11 to 2 central during the day.
[02:52:11.789 --> 02:52:15.132]  Tonight, 9 to midnight central, I'll rebroadcast here on the GCN radio network.
[02:52:15.653 --> 02:52:17.374]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[02:52:17.394 --> 02:52:23.119]  I wish people would duplicate it, but they just can't seem to stop infighting with each other long enough with the provocateurs to get that done.
[02:52:23.379 --> 02:52:25.061]  Jack, your show is coming up after the news.
[02:52:25.101 --> 02:52:26.923]  You're about eight minutes into the next hour.
[02:52:27.563 --> 02:52:29.764]  And I'm going to be joining you for the first 20 minutes of that.
[02:52:29.804 --> 02:52:31.645]  Then you've got a great guest coming on.
[02:52:31.665 --> 02:52:35.707]  But we're going to air part of my reenactment out there.
[02:52:35.727 --> 02:52:36.808]  And the audio is pretty good on it.
[02:52:36.828 --> 02:52:37.868]  You'll be able to see the video.
[02:52:37.888 --> 02:52:42.630]  We're going to air that coming up when we start your show in the next hour.
[02:52:42.650 --> 02:52:45.312]  So get some good crossover from my audience into your audience.
[02:52:45.332 --> 02:52:47.373]  We have a lot of the same AM and FM affiliates now.
[02:52:47.393 --> 02:52:49.894]  So that's really exciting to be able to continue on here.
[02:52:50.114 --> 02:52:51.715]  Think about what Genesis is doing.
[02:52:51.835 --> 02:52:52.695]  We're on the issues.
[02:52:52.895 --> 02:52:53.616]  We're on the facts.
[02:52:53.636 --> 02:52:55.096]  We're breaking huge news stories.
[02:52:55.116 --> 02:52:55.937]  We're covering wide
[02:52:56.357 --> 02:52:57.498]  Spectrum analysis.
[02:52:57.558 --> 02:53:05.503]  I'm just so proud, working at another radio station before I had a syndicated show, to have program directors trying to control what I said and being fired, even if I had high ratings.
[02:53:05.724 --> 02:53:07.625]  To have Ted Anderson never say anything to me.
[02:53:08.145 --> 02:53:14.710]  Genesis is the first place I've ever worked on radio, and I've been in radio on and off for almost 20 years.
[02:53:14.730 --> 02:53:19.533]  The first place I've ever worked at that just let me go unbridled and unmuzzled.
[02:53:19.573 --> 02:53:20.514]  That's a fact, Alex.
[02:53:21.658 --> 02:53:24.859]  I mean, even the people who claim... They may regret it now, but... No, no.
[02:53:24.899 --> 02:53:29.880]  I mean, there's people who claim that they have other networks where they don't censor, but they've tried... I mean, it's... They all do.
[02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:39.602]  As far as I know, again, I mean, 20 years in broadcasting, 20 years in the entertainment industry, this is the only company I've ever worked for that just stays out of your way and lets you do your job.
[02:53:40.082 --> 02:53:42.703]  But they are careful about not hiring lunatics.
[02:53:43.423 --> 02:53:50.748]  You know, they check you out first, check your credentials, make sure you're the real deal, and say, do whatever you want, just go report for us, muckrake, like old-fashioned reporters.
[02:53:51.309 --> 02:53:53.110]  And literally, we're drowning in the corruption.
[02:53:53.130 --> 02:54:01.036]  We just have boxes of documents and whistleblowers and NSA people calling us, and we're just... I mean, there's so much of it because there's not enough of us out here doing it.
[02:54:01.256 --> 02:54:03.097]  We need more people to get out there and be leaders.
[02:54:03.177 --> 02:54:09.063]  And let me also say that the affiliates that have been picking up your show and picking up my show also are very brave.
[02:54:09.243 --> 02:54:10.464]  They never get in our face.
[02:54:10.504 --> 02:54:11.425]  They never muzzle us.
[02:54:11.465 --> 02:54:13.307]  They never make suggestions.
[02:54:13.567 --> 02:54:14.228]  They go with it.
[02:54:14.248 --> 02:54:14.669]  They love it.
[02:54:14.689 --> 02:54:15.489]  They send me letters.
[02:54:15.589 --> 02:54:17.311]  Alex, I know you get letters from your affiliates.
[02:54:17.331 --> 02:54:18.633]  Thanking us for the programming.
[02:54:18.653 --> 02:54:23.197]  And I feel bad because I can't respond to them and thank them back because I'm literally... Yesterday, I worked 17 hours.
[02:54:24.742 --> 02:54:27.365]  I work from 6.30 until midnight.
[02:54:28.967 --> 02:54:30.128]  So however many hours that is.
[02:54:30.368 --> 02:54:31.429]  And you know what?
[02:54:31.529 --> 02:54:32.570]  I wanted to work more.
[02:54:32.650 --> 02:54:34.132]  I didn't want to go to sleep last night.
[02:54:34.472 --> 02:54:35.894]  I wanted to break a major story.
[02:54:35.954 --> 02:54:38.356]  I wanted to show how Cheney shot this guy up close.
[02:54:39.918 --> 02:54:42.140]  You've got to get this burr in the saddle to want to do this.
[02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:45.704]  Now listen, I've done three hours here now, or almost three hours.
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:50.164]  I haven't really plugged my videos yet, and that's how we fund this operation.
[02:54:50.204 --> 02:54:51.706]  That's how we do what we do.
[02:54:51.766 --> 02:54:54.669]  That's how I have my staff of nine people and growing here.
[02:54:55.070 --> 02:54:56.271]  That's how we get it done.
[02:54:56.672 --> 02:55:00.016]  Get Marshall Law, my new film that exposes government involvement in 9-11.
[02:55:00.536 --> 02:55:01.938]  Get my new film, The Order of Death.
[02:55:01.958 --> 02:55:03.780]  It gets into all the satanic rituals they're involved in.
[02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:04.641]  Mainstream.
[02:55:04.761 --> 02:55:05.782]  This is not my opinion.
[02:55:06.022 --> 02:55:06.703]  This is real.
[02:55:07.443 --> 02:55:09.165]  Get the books and videos we're carrying.
[02:55:09.205 --> 02:55:10.586]  Get 9-11 Synthetic Terror.

[02:55:42.108 --> 02:55:42.849]  So much other media.

[02:55:45.691 --> 02:55:48.532]  We need to hire somebody else to get these things on quicker because we're so busy.

[02:56:04.502 --> 02:56:05.383]  Big time Dick Cheney.

[02:56:35.950 --> 02:56:36.140]  Hello!
