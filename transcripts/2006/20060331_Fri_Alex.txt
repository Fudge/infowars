[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:05.481]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:07.202]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:09.043]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:10.504]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.225]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.805 --> 00:00:16.468]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:21.110]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:32.917]  Welcome.
[00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:35.279]  Welcome.
[00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:44.024]  It is the 31st day of March 2006.
[00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:54.371]  And I'm going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.391 --> 00:01:01.216]  But I tell you what I want to do, what I want to do right now, is we've got a lot of requests to play
[00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:03.845]  Also from our Patriot Music.
[00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.126]  So you can play whatever you like.
[00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:09.287]  You can play any song you want, guys.
[00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:12.728]  In fact, you just pick one and we'll go ahead and roll it.
[00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:22.730]  And then when we get back, I'll get into all the news and all the information right here on the Genesis Network.
[00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:24.751]  So, stay with us.
[00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:41.970]  It was an inside job by the well-connected
[00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:06.718]  You're in the middle of protest, so merrily rejected.
[00:02:07.278 --> 00:02:14.665]  It was an impasse, just like it always is.
[00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:21.712]  Chalk it up to business as usual.
[00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:55.857]  This little island disappears While you are looking the other way They'll take your right to own your own ideas And if it isn't time to
[00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:00.654]  We're good to go.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.400]  We're good to go.
[00:04:06.316 --> 00:04:08.417]  I know what I've done wrong.
[00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:11.538]  I am acquainted with the night.
[00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:17.560]  I know how hard it is to always walk out in the night.
[00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:23.243]  And it's an inside job to learn about forgiving.
[00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:30.345]  It's an inside job to hang on to the joy of living.
[00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:32.346]  You know the road by which you came.
[00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:50.662]  It's an inside joke.
[00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.544]  It's an inside joke.
[00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.184]  Folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:05.427]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:09.452]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:13.796]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:17.861]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:19.803]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:23.285]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:28.048]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:31.249]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.291]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:40.915]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:45.240]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.890]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:07.611]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.311 --> 00:08:09.452]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:10.892]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.633 --> 00:08:12.453]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:17.155]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:21.517]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:26.320]  Yes, my friends, it is Friday.
[00:08:28.317 --> 00:08:31.458]  The 31st day of March 2006, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:36.018]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and 51 and a half minutes.
[00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:41.319]  And there is a mass of vital news and information to be covered.
[00:08:41.339 --> 00:08:45.460]  This is the type of news that's in front of me on the plate today, in the stack.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.981]  Ex-FBI agent indicted in mob killings, Associated Press.
[00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.582]  How many times have I seen similar headlines to this?
[00:08:54.662 --> 00:08:57.002]  But it'll never be a big national scandal.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.503]  Senate panel set to consider bid to censure Bush.
[00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:09.570]  Actor and director Ed Asner shares 9-11 concerns, agrees that it is a cover-up and a hoax.
[00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:16.276]  The official story highlights the report of hijackers still alive and well by the BBC and Associated Press.
[00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:18.525]  Here's another one.
[00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:22.546]  Bush reassures Mexico on migrants.
[00:09:22.566 --> 00:09:23.507]  They're not illegal aliens.
[00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:24.507]  They're not even immigrants now.
[00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:25.487]  They're migrants.
[00:09:25.547 --> 00:09:28.228]  They're like migratory birds or something.
[00:09:28.948 --> 00:09:33.790]  Don't worry, he tells Vicente Fox down in Cancun, in the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.331]  Don't worry, America's going down and the conservatives are gonna love it.
[00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:42.132]  Presidential advisor says he would welcome Chinese attack.
[00:09:43.406 --> 00:09:46.408]  Biggest Euro aspartame producer.
[00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:51.170]  Biggest European aspartame producer to quit production because people aren't drinking it.
[00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:56.753]  That's wonderful, wonderful, wonderful news there.
[00:09:56.813 --> 00:09:58.214]  And then a really sick article.
[00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:01.796]  We have gotten reports of this from the troops in the last year.
[00:10:01.856 --> 00:10:07.298]  We have reported this year ourselves with guests, but it had never been in the mainstream news.
[00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:10.360]  It is outrageous, like everything else that's happening.
[00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:15.493]  Army bans use of privately bought body armor.
[00:10:16.393 --> 00:10:26.517]  For thousands of years, soldiers have supplemented what the Imperium, what the Roman Empire, or the Greek Empire, or the Persian Empire issued them.
[00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:28.595]  But not anymore!
[00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:33.658]  You are not allowed to buy level 3 body armor for yourself, which most of the troops have done.
[00:10:33.678 --> 00:10:41.444]  You've got to buy, or you've got to pay for if it's damaged, the crummy level 2 defective junk
[00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:59.884]  Uh, that is being, uh, given to them, and again, if it's damaged in any way, they pay, what is it, $700 for about a $150, uh, flak vest, and then it turned out the company that the Pentagon bought from, uh, basically didn't even put, uh, any body armor in it, any Teflon in it.
[00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:03.665]  And, uh, but it, it doesn't matter.
[00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:10.227]  The person that sold it to them is busy giving his daughter $35 million birthday parties, uh, in New York City.
[00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:15.327]  And so, uh, you guys are not going to have your own body armor.
[00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:18.750]  Your families aren't going to pay for it, and they're not going to ship it to you.
[00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.232]  It's banned.
[00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:23.055]  You're going to wear defective junk.
[00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.597]  Because the government loves you.
[00:11:25.717 --> 00:11:28.420]  And you're going to breathe depleted uranium.
[00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:33.565]  And you're going, if you get an armor leg blown off, you're going to pay for your own meals in the hospital.
[00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:34.086]  Conferred!
[00:11:34.682 --> 00:11:37.964]  Neocon scumbags like to avoid that, but it's true.
[00:11:38.424 --> 00:11:44.028]  And you will pay for your own flight home when you're discharged out of Rammstein with your arms and legs blown off.
[00:11:44.608 --> 00:11:46.249]  This is how you support the troops.
[00:11:46.289 --> 00:12:01.899]  You close the door on them, you don't care about them, you stick a ribbon on your car, which means you support feeding them into a radioactive wasteland so they can come back and have deformed children at now four times the national average.
[00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:04.765]  It has been triple in the past.
[00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:06.305]  Now the numbers are out.
[00:12:06.345 --> 00:12:07.586]  It's a quadrupling.
[00:12:08.406 --> 00:12:12.207]  That's because they used a lot more three years ago in the major cities.
[00:12:13.168 --> 00:12:16.309]  And so now the troops are having a real hard time.
[00:12:16.349 --> 00:12:18.150]  But that's how you support them.
[00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:18.990]  By killing them.
[00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:20.891]  By deforming them.
[00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:21.751]  By maiming them.
[00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:24.152]  Here's another one.
[00:12:24.212 --> 00:12:26.753]  Plans for Massive Blast in Nevada draw fire.
[00:12:28.146 --> 00:12:40.374]  Plans for the Pentagon-led experiment that involves detonating 700 tons of explosives in the desert for criticism from state leaders and a disarmament activist who says a big cloud of dust will settle over Las Vegas and other areas.
[00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:40.695]  Hey!
[00:12:42.036 --> 00:12:44.617]  You want to test 700 tons of conventional explosive?
[00:12:45.378 --> 00:12:45.898]  Go at it!
[00:12:45.918 --> 00:12:55.685]  I mean, that's not really bad for anybody or anything compared to 10 proving grounds in the United States using tons every year of uranium.
[00:12:57.959 --> 00:12:58.700]  And ammunitions.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.700]  That is bad.
[00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:05.603]  And then the local radiation detectors go off and the government says, it's good for you.
[00:13:07.004 --> 00:13:12.527]  So we'll get into that report about the 700 ton blast test to be carried out near Las Vegas.
[00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:17.209]  No apology from Cynthia McKinney for Hill Scuffle, Associated Press.
[00:13:17.249 --> 00:13:18.410]  Now what's a Hill Scuffle?
[00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.931]  Because see, he assaulted her.
[00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:22.352]  He brutally manhandled her.
[00:13:22.412 --> 00:13:23.473]  First it was he tapped her.
[00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:37.438]  Then it was he just put a hand on her, then it was he grabbed her with one hand, now he grabbed her with two hands by both the arms from behind, and she spun around and bumped him, and boy, she needs to be charged with that!
[00:13:38.778 --> 00:13:44.661]  So we'll get into that report as well for you today.
[00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:51.143]  There is so much more that we'll be covering, but let me just start with this right now.
[00:13:51.886 --> 00:13:56.812]  Oh, by the way, yesterday I said I'd get into how Ritalin's killing thousands of children with their hearts exploding.
[00:13:56.852 --> 00:13:57.633]  Mainstream news.
[00:13:58.113 --> 00:13:59.055]  I didn't really detail that.
[00:13:59.095 --> 00:14:00.056]  I will cover that today.
[00:14:00.116 --> 00:14:00.536]  I'm going to.
[00:14:00.616 --> 00:14:01.658]  It's here on the top of the stack.
[00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:07.224]  And then some good news about how vitamin C just absolutely annihilates cancer.
[00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:10.688]  Both pushing it off, pushing it back.
[00:14:12.905 --> 00:14:16.469]  Until years later when you're going to get it, even if you're genetically predisposed to get it.
[00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:28.083]  And then when you get it, massive doses of organic, that is living vitamin C. It needs to be in the cell structures of the plant matter when you're eating it.
[00:14:28.877 --> 00:14:29.858]  That's what the studies show.
[00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:31.779]  Of course, we already knew that from Nobel Prize winners.
[00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:33.340]  But here it is.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.122]  So, taking the pills, I guess, does something.
[00:14:36.162 --> 00:14:40.925]  But it isn't really vitamin C when it's busted down to its base acid level.
[00:14:41.025 --> 00:14:43.587]  It needs to be in the apple, in the orange.
[00:14:44.047 --> 00:14:45.448]  Well, the best thing you can eat is blueberries.
[00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:47.169]  Blueberries have the highest level.
[00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:48.490]  Berries, period.
[00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:50.892]  And it's just magic.
[00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:54.334]  Sometimes I've got to do some coast-to-coast interview.
[00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:57.660]  And I'm totally exhausted.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.981]  I've been up since 6 a.m.
[00:14:59.001 --> 00:14:59.722]  the day before.
[00:15:00.462 --> 00:15:01.403]  I've had no sleep.
[00:15:02.003 --> 00:15:03.525]  I've already done two or three interviews.
[00:15:03.585 --> 00:15:04.245]  My own radio show.
[00:15:04.405 --> 00:15:05.446]  I've already done video editing.
[00:15:05.466 --> 00:15:09.029]  I've already prepared the websites and told the webmasters what to post for the show.
[00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:11.991]  And I'm cross-eyed at midnight when I'm about to go on.
[00:15:12.731 --> 00:15:14.052]  And coffee won't do it, I've learned.
[00:15:14.072 --> 00:15:18.596]  Coffee will just make me feel... I'll be wide awake, headache, sick, burnout.
[00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:23.219]  But if I go gobble a bunch of blueberries and a big glass of orange juice and an apple,
[00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:25.110]  It's not just the sugar, folks.
[00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.171]  If I go drink a sugar drink, I'll feel horrible 20 minutes later.
[00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:37.596]  If I go get a big dosing of vitamin C and all the other luscious nutrients, minerals, vitamins, ring structures, enzymes, I am good to go.
[00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:39.437]  Fruit, fruit, fruit.
[00:15:39.697 --> 00:15:41.298]  And I say that because I haven't been eating enough fruit.
[00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:47.962]  When I was young and I was a fruit addict, and over the years I got to where I ate all this dead food, and that's what it is.
[00:15:48.622 --> 00:15:49.722]  The stuff you eat is dead.
[00:15:49.922 --> 00:15:51.603]  Most of us eat nothing but a dead diet.
[00:15:51.623 --> 00:15:54.823]  And I just have a big... Okay, now I'm going off on a health food jag.
[00:15:54.863 --> 00:15:55.903]  Not that I'm Mr. Healthy.
[00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:59.184]  I don't take very good care of myself.
[00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:08.346]  But it's just to be energized by eating a couple fresh kiwis or eating a big bowl of blueberries or blackberries or raspberries.
[00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:10.726]  And if you want to put some whipped cream on top, go ahead.
[00:16:10.746 --> 00:16:15.207]  You want to, you know, put some Cool Whip on top, so what?
[00:16:16.219 --> 00:16:18.021]  If it helps you gobble it down, do it.
[00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:18.982]  That's what I did.
[00:16:19.162 --> 00:16:19.822]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:16:20.042 --> 00:16:20.363]  I'm sorry.
[00:16:21.404 --> 00:16:24.366]  Your children really shouldn't be drinking these soft drinks.
[00:16:24.406 --> 00:16:28.549]  I see parents all the time with three-year-olds drinking Coca-Cola's full of pesticide.
[00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:29.130]  It's admitted.
[00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.992]  Because they don't extract the pesticide out of the coca leaves.
[00:16:32.112 --> 00:16:36.395]  Instead of decaffeinating coffee, it's decocinated.
[00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:37.636]  Literally, it's cocaine.
[00:16:37.977 --> 00:16:39.338]  That's why it's called Coke, folks.
[00:16:39.918 --> 00:16:43.021]  It's the same ingredient in Dr. Pepper's and Pepsi.
[00:16:43.181 --> 00:16:43.501]  All of it.
[00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:44.422]  It's cocaine flavor.
[00:16:45.228 --> 00:16:47.870]  It has much of the molecules, so it kind of fools the brain.
[00:16:48.691 --> 00:16:49.612]  Not just caffeine.
[00:16:50.132 --> 00:16:55.857]  And then you've got the very dangerous types of processed syrups.
[00:16:55.877 --> 00:17:00.020]  That's why we've... We had a what?
[00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.502]  A tenfold increase?
[00:17:01.522 --> 00:17:02.663]  I think it's worse than that now.
[00:17:02.703 --> 00:17:03.423]  That's old numbers.
[00:17:03.443 --> 00:17:06.146]  I remember reading a few years ago that it was a tenfold increase.
[00:17:06.186 --> 00:17:09.609]  We're in an epidemic of diabetes and juvenile diabetes.
[00:17:09.649 --> 00:17:12.311]  Well, can you imagine the kids at school
[00:17:13.446 --> 00:17:14.667]  And I remember being in school.
[00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:21.210]  Well, when I was in elementary and then middle school, they didn't have candy bar machines, yet they had Coke machines.
[00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:30.735]  But by the time I hit high school, both in Dallas and two years down here in Austin, where I finished school, there were candy bar machines everywhere.
[00:17:30.755 --> 00:17:31.856]  There were Coke machines everywhere.
[00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:33.537]  There was nothing nutritious in the machines.
[00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:38.097]  And I would just watch people.
[00:17:38.117 --> 00:17:46.880]  I mean, I'd eat a candy bar and have a headache an hour later because, you know, you have a sugar spike and then the insulin pumps out of your pancreas and you feel like total garbage 30 minutes to an hour later.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.241]  And I'm watching these people eating candy bars.
[00:17:49.882 --> 00:17:58.125]  I had some people, you know, you got six periods in a day and for some reason you'll have two or three people that are in all the same classes with you.
[00:17:58.863 --> 00:18:04.324]  And I'd watch these people, even jocks, who you think would know better, eating candy bars almost every class.
[00:18:04.524 --> 00:18:10.086]  Eating them in the hallway, sticking them in their mouth, cramming them down, sucking down a Coca-Cola before they came in.
[00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:12.746]  But you see 8-year-olds doing this.
[00:18:14.067 --> 00:18:16.227]  You see 5-year-olds doing this.
[00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:18.908]  And they're bouncing off the walls, misbehaving.
[00:18:18.928 --> 00:18:26.990]  Listen, with my children, if I ever do give them a piece of cake or something at a birthday party, which they might get 4 or 5 times a year when they go to birthday parties, they're always bad afterwards.
[00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:32.576]  My children are not bad at all, but they're always bad after they eat processed sugar.
[00:18:33.876 --> 00:18:40.379]  Well, I mean, forget processed sugar, then you throw in aspartame and all this other stuff and Ritalin, but I wonder if they're acting like a bunch of freaks.
[00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:40.759]  Alright.
[00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:41.719]  See, I digress.
[00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:42.540]  I always digress.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.080]  But I'm going to get more into that later.
[00:18:45.081 --> 00:18:49.062]  When we get back, ex-FBI agent indicted in mob killings.
[00:18:49.422 --> 00:18:51.203]  Ex-FBI agent indicted in mob killings.
[00:18:52.483 --> 00:18:53.944]  Remember up in Boston?
[00:18:54.284 --> 00:18:56.305]  Well, this is up in New York.
[00:18:57.589 --> 00:19:03.495]  But then we've had it in Texas and California and Nevada and Arizona and Ohio.
[00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:07.520]  I mean, let me tell you who the Mafia hires.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.342]  Let me tell you who they got on their payroll.
[00:19:09.402 --> 00:19:17.090]  They got killers with badges, just like the police captain says in Scarface, that great Oliver Stone De Palma film.
[00:19:18.664 --> 00:19:20.906]  By the way, he studied for five years before he made that film.
[00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:24.609]  He wanted to make it real, with real characters, with just the names changed.
[00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.670]  All of that stuff really happened in Miami.
[00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.671]  You know that's a real story?
[00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:29.292]  You know that's a true story?
[00:19:29.312 --> 00:19:30.553]  Yeah.
[00:19:31.053 --> 00:19:34.876]  But, um... He goes, you know what, Tony?
[00:19:34.896 --> 00:19:37.678]  You're gonna be paying me 20% of all the coke you sell.
[00:19:37.698 --> 00:19:38.459]  And you know what, Tony?
[00:19:38.859 --> 00:19:39.680]  You give me a problem?
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:40.781]  You think you got a lot of goons?
[00:19:42.442 --> 00:19:44.664]  I got over a dozen killers with badges.
[00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:46.205]  And when they hit, it hurts.
[00:19:46.834 --> 00:19:48.716]  So you're gonna do exactly what I say, Tony.
[00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:50.457]  You understand, Tony?
[00:19:52.318 --> 00:19:57.823]  So almost every major police chief, every top FBI agent is slinging coke.
[00:19:58.003 --> 00:19:58.684]  Be right back.
[00:20:00.612 --> 00:20:03.895]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:20:03.955 --> 00:20:08.138]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:20:08.378 --> 00:20:11.180]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.762]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:20:13.942 --> 00:20:22.589]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:24.150]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.473]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:20:28.813 --> 00:20:29.594]  We're good to go!
[00:20:57.614 --> 00:20:59.297]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:00.238 --> 00:21:02.361]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:03.102]  One and the same.
[00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:05.946]  If you have deposited $100,000 at a bank at 1%,
[00:21:14.324 --> 00:21:19.786]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:23.327]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:23.607 --> 00:21:25.448]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:25.488 --> 00:21:28.529]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:29.069 --> 00:21:31.290]  Here is reality.
[00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.231]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:39.372]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:39.953 --> 00:21:42.454]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:47.840]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:21:49.362 --> 00:21:49.602]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.495]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:02.615 --> 00:22:07.938]  Did you know executive orders and other laws have already been passed that can create a legal dictatorship in America?
[00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:21.384]  These laws can affect you by seizing all communication media, all electric power, fuel, minerals, food supplies and resources, all farms and farm equipment, all means of transportation including personal vehicles.
[00:22:22.063 --> 00:22:25.404]  Total control over all highways, seaports, and waterways.
[00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:28.525]  Seize all American people for workforces.
[00:22:29.386 --> 00:22:31.767]  These laws extend to all parts of our life.
[00:22:32.387 --> 00:22:39.950]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to News Watch Magazine.

[00:23:00.216 --> 00:23:01.896]  What causes foods to spoil?
[00:23:02.317 --> 00:23:05.297]  All produce produces a natural gas which causes ripening.
[00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:10.839]  In addition, foods like onions and garlic emit odors, causing foods to lose their freshness and flavor.
[00:23:10.979 --> 00:23:14.302]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, everything stays fresh much longer.
[00:23:14.362 --> 00:23:17.005]  Like strawberries, which now last a couple of weeks instead of just a few days.
[00:23:30.817 --> 00:23:34.358]  Jane Burke of New Jersey says, You know, we eat a lot of salads.
[00:23:34.518 --> 00:23:37.979]  I used to throw out the leftovers because they'd turn brown and they'd shrivel up.
[00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:39.380]  I'm really amazed.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:45.382]  Since I started using Forever Fresh, all my produce stays fresher longer, including the leftovers.
[00:23:45.522 --> 00:23:47.983]  Now I just couldn't get along without Forever Fresh.
[00:23:48.303 --> 00:23:55.005]  To order your Forever Fresh for the fridge, visit the web at foreverfresh.us or call toll free 1-866-NO-ODORS.
[00:23:55.025 --> 00:23:56.385]  That's 1-866-NO-ODORS.
[00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:09.039]  Look, you give individuals unlimited power.
[00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:13.601]  You give them anonymity, you give them a secret operation, you give them a big budget.
[00:24:14.762 --> 00:24:23.025]  You may have all good cops at the beginning, all good judges, all good people in government, which we know is never the case because they're just like the general public.
[00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:27.047]  They're gonna have good ones, bad ones, and stupid ones, and smart ones, and in-between ones.
[00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:38.734]  But over time, history has shown, common sense has shown, that evil, corrupt syndicates get their foot in the door and very soon thereafter take over.
[00:24:40.214 --> 00:24:42.755]  And let me assure you, the criminals have taken over.
[00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:48.857]  And that's why they now have handbooks in Texas, Nevada, Arizona, Virginia, New York.
[00:24:48.957 --> 00:24:53.298]  Every state in the union has federally written handbooks.
[00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:54.999]  They're all almost the same.
[00:24:55.019 --> 00:25:00.320]  They just have different seals on the front issued by the governor's offices of the state or in some cases by the FBI.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.201]  We just covered the Virginia handbook that says property rights activists are terrorists.
[00:25:05.262 --> 00:25:07.562]  Anyone who tries to influence the government are terrorists.
[00:25:07.902 --> 00:25:09.643]  Anyone who demonstrates are terrorists.
[00:25:09.683 --> 00:25:11.183]  Anyone who does anything are terrorists.
[00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:12.641]  And that's not our opinion.
[00:25:12.682 --> 00:25:13.522]  It's mainstream news.
[00:25:13.542 --> 00:25:14.683]  They report it like it's good.
[00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:16.063]  Oh, you're a terrorist.
[00:25:16.123 --> 00:25:17.404]  If you protest, you're a terrorist.
[00:25:17.944 --> 00:25:20.025]  Well, isn't that what criminals would do?
[00:25:20.766 --> 00:25:28.349]  They get the Supreme Court and state courts to start ruling that private interests can take your land without even paying you just compensation.
[00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:29.390]  Forget best price.
[00:25:30.934 --> 00:25:32.396]  Or best use, as it's known.
[00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:33.657]  I mean, you don't even get to that.
[00:25:33.837 --> 00:25:39.202]  They will come in and they will condemn your property and then give you the lot value.
[00:25:39.242 --> 00:25:49.353]  Let's say on the tax rolls, in one case, your house is valued at $307,000, as in the case of one three-story Victorian-style home, waterfront in New London, Connecticut.
[00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:51.114]  And the people fought them.
[00:25:51.134 --> 00:25:52.075]  They wouldn't give their land up.
[00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:53.557]  And they said, you know, we're condemning it.
[00:25:54.389 --> 00:26:01.615]  Beautiful home, and we're going to give you $60,000 of the tax rate lot value of the home.
[00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:04.197]  So keep laughing, keep giggling.
[00:26:04.257 --> 00:26:07.860]  It's going to happen to more and more of us because we have a criminal government.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.022]  You see, that's what a mafia would do.
[00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:14.938]  There are free speech zones so you can't protest us.
[00:26:15.879 --> 00:26:17.921]  There are restrictions on your speech.
[00:26:18.882 --> 00:26:20.925]  You can't go out and protest us.
[00:26:21.465 --> 00:26:23.748]  We can spy on you without warrants.
[00:26:23.808 --> 00:26:26.891]  We can hire people with criminal records to work for us.
[00:26:26.911 --> 00:26:28.733]  You know, the government, state and federal,
[00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:40.246]  Now, and even local, aren't just hiring informants to go finger innocent people and then testify against them secretly in secret dockets all over the country, from Miami to New York, from Houston to L.A.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.304]  They're now even having their informants break in your house and, quote, investigate.
[00:26:47.344 --> 00:26:50.446]  I mean, it's getting so criminal now.
[00:26:50.826 --> 00:26:54.830]  It's called tyranny when your government goes bad, and that's the norm in history.
[00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:56.551]  That happens nine times out of ten.
[00:26:56.851 --> 00:26:57.852]  In fact, even more than that.
[00:26:57.912 --> 00:27:01.835]  I mean, freedom, a free society, is unknown almost in history.
[00:27:01.895 --> 00:27:03.656]  It is so rare.
[00:27:03.716 --> 00:27:06.599]  It has to be fought for viciously.
[00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:09.581]  It has to be jealously, greedily,
[00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:11.483]  Guarded and protected.
[00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:20.511]  It is a precious, precious thing like a rare flower that if the wind hits it wrong, or you don't water it right, or it doesn't get enough sun, it dies.
[00:27:21.832 --> 00:27:24.054]  And I'm here to tell you, it died, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:24.074 --> 00:27:28.178]  Now we're trying to, we're trying to replant and get it back.
[00:27:28.498 --> 00:27:29.959]  By the way, here it is, Associated Press.
[00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:31.621]  And listen, I see these articles every day.
[00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:33.723]  Seriously, I just don't cover them most of the time.
[00:27:34.483 --> 00:27:36.285]  I'm so sick of it, I get burnout on it.
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:37.780]  Associated Press.
[00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:40.741]  Ex-FBI agent indicted in mob killings.
[00:27:41.462 --> 00:27:52.126]  A retired FBI agent was indicted on murder charges Thursday for allegedly taking bribes from a mobster to supply him with inside information that led to four underworld slayings in Brooklyn.
[00:27:53.086 --> 00:27:55.287]  Yeah, you got killers with badges, don't you?
[00:27:55.307 --> 00:28:01.409]  And it even mentions how they give them other drug dealers to bust that are low-level, because as they say, they like snacks.
[00:28:04.918 --> 00:28:12.404]  Lindley DaVaccio, 65, was arrested in a case of confidential leaked payoffs and debt.
[00:28:12.784 --> 00:28:24.432]  Dating back two decades, District Attorney Charles Hines said DaVincio pleaded not guilty and was released on $1 million bail.
[00:28:24.932 --> 00:28:26.814]  He did not speak at the arraignment.
[00:28:26.974 --> 00:28:31.217]  One of the two alleged mob hitmen behind the slings was jailed without bail.
[00:28:31.257 --> 00:28:33.879]  The other was in Florida awaiting extradition.
[00:28:34.699 --> 00:28:38.122]  Colleagues of the FBI veteran were quick to defend him against the charges.
[00:28:38.242 --> 00:28:40.063]  Yeah, because you don't want to go down either, do you?
[00:28:40.764 --> 00:28:51.271]  We all know, Len, and we all know he's not capable of doing these kinds of things, said James Costler, a former supervisor with the FBI's New York officers, said Wednesday.
[00:28:51.812 --> 00:28:55.735]  It's so sad it could happen to a guy like this.
[00:28:56.494 --> 00:29:15.906]  Heinz, who I'm sure is a wonderful person, said the charges stemmed from unusually close relationships between Devincio, then head of the FBI's Colombo Crime Family Squad, and Gregory Scarpa, Sr., a government informant and Colombo captain nicknamed the Grim Reaper.
[00:29:17.487 --> 00:29:19.388]  No, I'm pronouncing that wrong because I've heard his name before.
[00:29:20.369 --> 00:29:20.849]  Scarpa.
[00:29:21.613 --> 00:29:28.534]  The pair met each week during the 80s and 90s and discussed a bloody civil war within the Colombo family in exchange for bribes.
[00:29:29.074 --> 00:29:34.456]  Da Vincio counseled Scarpa to protect him by eliminating imminent threats.
[00:29:34.596 --> 00:29:35.656]  And it goes on and on.
[00:29:35.676 --> 00:29:37.976]  I mean, that's nothing.
[00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:38.856]  That's nothing.
[00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:40.057]  They run the whores.
[00:29:40.457 --> 00:29:41.637]  They run the drugs.
[00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:43.337]  They run the kidnapped kids.
[00:29:44.077 --> 00:29:47.018]  We've had FBI agents on the talk about it, by the way, and New York detectives.
[00:29:50.333 --> 00:29:53.339]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.261 --> 00:29:56.946]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.194 --> 00:30:04.638]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:30:04.899 --> 00:30:08.482]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:30:08.642 --> 00:30:16.790]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:22.656]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:30:22.956 --> 00:30:28.199]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:30.540]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:42.946]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:30:43.186 --> 00:30:47.610]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.771]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:48.971 --> 00:30:50.593]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:30:50.713 --> 00:30:52.514]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:53.235]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:30:53.255 --> 00:30:53.455]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:13.210]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.913]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:31:17.173 --> 00:31:21.395]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:21.675 --> 00:31:25.617]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[00:31:25.837 --> 00:31:32.360]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:38.063]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:38.303 --> 00:31:45.229]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.413]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:49.473 --> 00:31:52.116]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:31:52.136 --> 00:31:53.337]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:03.194]  And now a word from Dr. Patricia Margaitis from Stem Enhance.
[00:32:03.634 --> 00:32:07.798]  I want to first thank the wonderful GCN listeners for supporting Stem Enhance.
[00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:15.707]  Now know that your own stem cells are your body's maintenance group and Stem Enhance makes sure that more of them show up for work every day.
[00:32:16.127 --> 00:32:20.132]  The truth is, the more stem cells you have in your bloodstream, the greater your health.
[00:32:20.513 --> 00:32:33.930]  If you believe there is something more for you, have a strong work ethic, and wish to participate in the monumental increase in the cause for natural health, while gaining financial independence and monthly cash flow, then you are the right person.
[00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.731]  I personally invite you to join me as the distributor of Stem and Hem.
[00:32:38.151 --> 00:32:42.412]  I am committed to personally make sure you receive the tools needed to succeed.
[00:32:42.753 --> 00:32:45.673]  Remember, the first rule of success, you must show up.
[00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:49.134]  Call me, Dr. Patricia Margaitis at 860-567-7744.
[00:32:49.154 --> 00:32:50.655]  That number again, 860-567-7744.
[00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:17.906]  Before I get back into the FBI hitmen... By the way, it was admitted in Boston.
[00:33:18.207 --> 00:33:19.608]  People were convicted in Boston.
[00:33:20.729 --> 00:33:28.094]  It's just a huge segment of the FBI organization involved in murder for hire, running hitmen, dealing drugs.
[00:33:28.615 --> 00:33:30.196]  It's just constantly coming out.
[00:33:30.928 --> 00:33:31.889]  I mean, it's scary.
[00:33:32.109 --> 00:33:38.794]  And when you see some of these people, when you go and investigate them, when you cover stories that they're involved with, I mean, these are scary gangsters.
[00:33:39.555 --> 00:33:44.858]  I mean, if you don't have a camera on, they'll come right over, just like monsters, and bump into you and go, you better watch it, Mac!
[00:33:45.699 --> 00:33:50.643]  It's like Scalia, who's a known gangster, not a conservative, Supreme Court Justice.
[00:33:51.924 --> 00:33:57.348]  He was at a big Catholic Church meeting for, quote, lawyers at a special mass.
[00:33:58.129 --> 00:34:02.053]  And a reporter said, what are you going to do if people keep talking about your conflict of interest?
[00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:17.047]  And he sits there and, you know, does the Italian for flipping the bird, but, you know, the mobster hand under the chin, flipping it outwards towards you and said the word for, you know, basically F-U.
[00:34:18.786 --> 00:34:25.753]  And Cheney will walk right up to Senators and do the same thing, growling cuss words with his yellow teeth showing.
[00:34:26.254 --> 00:34:27.335]  These are gangsters.
[00:34:27.395 --> 00:34:30.398]  These are hard-core criminals.
[00:34:30.978 --> 00:34:33.481]  These are hard-core crooks.
[00:34:34.302 --> 00:34:37.425]  These are hard-core mafia dons.
[00:34:37.925 --> 00:34:40.388]  These are hard-core individuals.
[00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:42.802]  And you need to understand that.
[00:34:42.862 --> 00:34:44.203]  And listen, it was illegal.
[00:34:44.283 --> 00:34:51.047]  It was a federal crime that Scalia took the equivalent of, they looked it up, about a $25,000 roughly.
[00:34:51.147 --> 00:34:59.372]  It was a $24,000 something dollar group of hunting trips with Cheney a week before he was going to hear Energy Task Force lawsuit.
[00:34:59.432 --> 00:35:07.437]  And of course he ruled for Cheney that no one could see his private Energy Task Force meetings with CEOs about how to jack up oil prices and run a big scam.
[00:35:08.772 --> 00:35:23.368]  These are the same people that ran the Enron scam where they bring members of Congress in to fake computer rooms with huge big screen computers in a fake control room showing them the energy trading in tens of millions of dollars a day.
[00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:24.630]  None of it was real!
[00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:30.685]  Literally, the heads of Enron would just decide what to charge people and how to scam people.
[00:35:31.045 --> 00:35:38.147]  And that's why, in some weeks, California would go $3 billion into debt in just a few weeks.
[00:35:38.507 --> 00:35:44.089]  It was a total of $9 billion over the few months they ran their scam.
[00:35:45.808 --> 00:35:55.399]  And they even did stuff like turn the power off and then their memos came out saying if we turn the power off it'll convince people that there's no power and then they'll accept higher prices.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:03.649]  By the way, Imran was involved in water gouging in the capital of Argentina.
[00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:05.611]  There were the Argentinians, Argentina.
[00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:11.208]  And the memos came out in the IMF and World Bank releases of early 2002.
[00:36:11.648 --> 00:36:13.809]  Remember Greg Powell was on one of those?
[00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:16.030]  There's a section on it in the end of my book.
[00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.672]  9-11 dissent into tyranny.
[00:36:19.672 --> 00:36:21.493]  I'll tell you how spot on Powell was.
[00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:25.375]  He said four days before it happened that they were going to kidnap and try to kill Hugo Chavez.
[00:36:25.395 --> 00:36:26.636]  And the CIA did do that.
[00:36:26.696 --> 00:36:35.201]  And then his troops took the Capitol building, the palace, back over and ordered that he be released because they weren't going to let the coup go ahead.
[00:36:36.337 --> 00:36:37.698]  So they got caught with their pants down.
[00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:53.612]  But there they were in the Argentine capital, and they said, we'll triple water prices now that we've taken it over from the government as part of an IMF World Bank deal, but the people won't accept that unless we turn it off for a week first.
[00:36:53.632 --> 00:36:59.817]  We'll just turn the water off, then they'll think there's a shortage, their psychological studies have shown, then they'll accept the gouging.
[00:37:00.447 --> 00:37:01.969]  Well, we're all going to live under this, too.
[00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:06.315]  We're talking $10 to $20 just to drive to work for the average Austinite.
[00:37:06.635 --> 00:37:09.919]  We're talking about $160 plus to drive to Dallas and back.
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:12.422]  The road's being handed over to a foreign Spanish company.
[00:37:12.723 --> 00:37:18.250]  Almost all the water districts just being given, not sold, just, here, you're the mafia, take our water.
[00:37:19.188 --> 00:37:21.271]  And it's the Dutch and British and German Mafia.
[00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:22.712]  That's what this is.
[00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:24.114]  We're being looted.
[00:37:24.715 --> 00:37:31.182]  Oh, here, we'll let the Communist Chinese Navy, that's what Hutchinson and Lompo admittedly, Congressional Studies show, run that company.
[00:37:31.222 --> 00:37:31.783]  They're troops.
[00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:33.124]  Captain the ships.
[00:37:33.485 --> 00:37:36.008]  Their captains are all PLA naval officers.
[00:37:37.967 --> 00:37:49.774]  And they're going to run the major port that is an American possession in the Bahamas, in the Caribbean, and run the radiation detectors, and the Customs isn't even allowed to be there.
[00:37:49.794 --> 00:37:53.156]  That's Associated Press, and it's a no-bid contract.
[00:37:53.176 --> 00:38:01.261]  You understand that they just, quote, give them the management, and then our government even pays them to take it over and run it with a hundred-year lease.
[00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:05.833]  That'd be like, you know, I'll pay you to take my house.
[00:38:05.933 --> 00:38:07.374]  I'll pay you to take my car.
[00:38:07.714 --> 00:38:13.898]  It's simply put, the companies grease a few Swiss bank accounts, and in some cases, public bank accounts.
[00:38:14.279 --> 00:38:16.540]  You know, the politician signs off on the bill.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.804]  They get hired to the board of directors for $500,000 a year and never even have to show up to a board of directors meeting.
[00:38:23.065 --> 00:38:27.848]  And a lot of these politicians, while they're in office, are on the boards of hundreds of companies.
[00:38:28.068 --> 00:38:32.611]  Did you know some of these politicians, some of these committee chairmen and others, are on the boards of hundreds?
[00:38:33.512 --> 00:38:34.232]  Hundreds.
[00:38:35.593 --> 00:38:36.053]  Hundreds.
[00:38:36.093 --> 00:38:42.938]  I mean, they're just, just imagine, hundreds of $500,000, $200,000, $1,000,000 checks every month.
[00:38:43.218 --> 00:38:57.588]  Can you imagine your mailbox, your bank accounts, every month, with hundreds of giant checks, millions of dollars every month, just coming in from foreign mafia, and that's what these corporations are, they're a global crime syndicate.
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.141]  Again, I will repeat this.
[00:39:00.721 --> 00:39:01.862]  This is last year's numbers.
[00:39:01.902 --> 00:39:02.942]  I'm told it's now worse.
[00:39:03.723 --> 00:39:10.227]  Of the 100 biggest economies covered by Forbes Magazine last year, they do it every year.
[00:39:10.687 --> 00:39:11.367]  I haven't seen the new one.
[00:39:11.387 --> 00:39:12.228]  I think I heard it came out.
[00:39:12.788 --> 00:39:18.211]  Of the 100 biggest economies, they don't just list the 100 richest.
[00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:19.692]  They also list the 100 biggest economies.
[00:39:20.732 --> 00:39:22.893]  Guess what 44 of them are?
[00:39:23.533 --> 00:39:25.714]  They are not governments.
[00:39:26.014 --> 00:39:27.654]  They are corporations.
[00:39:27.974 --> 00:39:29.855]  They have their own private armies.
[00:39:30.255 --> 00:39:32.616]  They have their own private intelligence agencies.
[00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:34.877]  They have their own private hitmen.
[00:39:35.297 --> 00:39:37.777]  They have their own departments for mistresses.
[00:39:38.178 --> 00:39:40.018]  I mean, they have everything.
[00:39:40.038 --> 00:39:41.078]  Do you understand that?
[00:39:41.238 --> 00:39:43.159]  They bought their own private islands.
[00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:48.941]  And that's why they then lobby Congress to legalize private mercenaries like Blackwater.
[00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:49.521]  Yes.
[00:40:10.885 --> 00:40:11.786]  It's amazing.
[00:40:11.866 --> 00:40:20.211]  Dyncor's mercs, according to MSNBC, are going to take over many of the sheriff parish departments in New Orleans.
[00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.092]  What did the feds do?
[00:40:21.492 --> 00:40:22.833]  They said, we're declaring an emergency.
[00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:23.713]  You're federalized.
[00:40:24.094 --> 00:40:24.694]  Furlough.
[00:40:24.754 --> 00:40:25.635]  Go read MSNBC.
[00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:28.176]  This isn't my opinion, police out there listening.
[00:40:28.216 --> 00:40:29.237]  I want you to know your future.
[00:40:30.422 --> 00:40:37.886]  They said, we're ordering you to furlough 55% in one case, 55% of your officers.
[00:40:37.906 --> 00:40:40.347]  We're going to pay for your bills, but you've got to furlough half.
[00:40:40.407 --> 00:40:41.068]  That is, let them go.
[00:40:41.088 --> 00:40:42.669]  50-54%.
[00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:50.613]  Then they came back and they said, okay, you are going to now sign a contract with the federal government and with Dime Corp.
[00:40:52.268 --> 00:41:02.033]  And DynCorp is going to permanently take over, and they're going to wear sheriff's uniforms but with a DynCorp badge and have full law enforcement power.
[00:41:02.933 --> 00:41:09.856]  And they're going to be paid at least double what your sheriff's deputies were paid, and they won't be made up of your sheriff's deputies.
[00:41:09.876 --> 00:41:11.197]  They're coming in from all over the country.
[00:41:11.617 --> 00:41:13.298]  They're most of them are former special forces.
[00:41:14.273 --> 00:41:22.338]  And you see, these private mafias are now changing the laws, setting the precedent where their people can now operate.
[00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:26.000]  And so it's simple.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:37.166]  You know, five years in the future, whenever more and more terror takes place, it might be a month from now, there are boys who have been killing women and children all over the planet from these different merc outfits.
[00:41:38.208 --> 00:41:43.929]  They just drop by and roll down the window and stick their blurt gun out the window and hit me with, you know, 25 rounds.
[00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:48.330]  Or get a double tap to the head and just, well, that's what the mercs do.
[00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.230]  You see, a total gangland lawlessness.
[00:41:52.271 --> 00:41:54.831]  Good cops don't follow what the mob says, you're dead.
[00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:59.832]  Other low-level crime syndicates don't get in line and follow the big mafia, you're dead.
[00:42:00.272 --> 00:42:02.873]  People that don't want to give up their ranches and farms, you're dead.
[00:42:03.413 --> 00:42:05.053]  They're going to send hit squads out.
[00:42:07.017 --> 00:42:09.417]  You want to go protest that they're taking your property?
[00:42:09.437 --> 00:42:10.138]  You're a terrorist!
[00:42:10.158 --> 00:42:13.298]  We're going to arrest you, and we're going to take you to a FEMA camp.
[00:42:14.418 --> 00:42:33.742]  You know, I confirmed and was allowed to see the video, and I videotaped it myself in California and other areas of the nation, and got video from Swansboro, North Carolina, and Hebron, Maryland, and news reports from everywhere, but I was able to watch video that two construction workers shot at an Air Force base of all places in San Antonio
[00:42:34.981 --> 00:42:45.487]  Of a large contingent of Marines, looked like over a hundred on video, with over a hundred role players, most of Marines, some of them though women and even young people hired, a local acting group.
[00:42:46.688 --> 00:42:54.052]  I was allowed to see the video, but I was not allowed to put it on TV because they were on top of a roof fixing something and they knew that they would have been identified.
[00:42:55.174 --> 00:43:00.156]  And I wish I had this on tape, but I was allowed to watch it and I had to give it back.
[00:43:00.176 --> 00:43:01.236]  The guy right there in the studio.
[00:43:01.256 --> 00:43:02.017]  I know you're listening.
[00:43:02.497 --> 00:43:04.157]  This is six years ago now.
[00:43:04.217 --> 00:43:06.258]  Will you just bring me the tape back and let me have it?
[00:43:07.939 --> 00:43:08.739]  No, you won't, will you?
[00:43:08.799 --> 00:43:14.281]  But the role players all have these signs going, Don't take my land!
[00:43:14.301 --> 00:43:15.042]  This is America!
[00:43:15.082 --> 00:43:15.662]  No, no, no!
[00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:21.004]  And then they have one of the role players throw a bottle at the cops.
[00:43:22.194 --> 00:43:26.615]  And the Marine Military Police.
[00:43:27.756 --> 00:43:35.218]  And they opened fire on them with heavy machine guns and armored vehicles, and they all practiced falling down and dying, and they did it several times.
[00:43:36.139 --> 00:43:39.460]  But I just remembered, I don't have to claim I saw that video.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:44.501]  It was out of Virginia last year.
[00:43:44.681 --> 00:43:46.482]  Remember we played the audio over and over again?
[00:43:46.502 --> 00:43:48.082]  In fact, try to find that in the computer.
[00:43:48.162 --> 00:43:49.943]  I forget what it was called, but it's on the website.
[00:43:53.539 --> 00:44:01.102]  Remember, and it said, oh yes, we've got the police out here, and they're practicing being snipers, shooting the protesters, remember?
[00:44:01.462 --> 00:44:07.064]  And it showed cops on horseback, and other cops dressed up, fighting with them, and so the cops shoot them, so good.
[00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:08.384]  Yes, we do have that on video.
[00:44:08.785 --> 00:44:19.408]  You see, I get sent a news clip of this, and then I put it on the website, we play it, and then eight, nine months, I don't remember how long ago it was, it was last year, we didn't forget about it, and then I start talking about it, and I remember.
[00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:20.909]  So we do have footage of that, I'm sorry.
[00:44:22.806 --> 00:44:25.607]  But they weren't playing the parts of land rights activists.
[00:44:25.687 --> 00:44:32.349]  They were playing the part of rioting American citizens, for whatever reason, who had taken over the courthouse.
[00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:32.889]  That's right.
[00:44:33.289 --> 00:44:36.230]  And so the police come in and kill them.
[00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:43.612]  And they're training the police that they're fighting back with bottles and broomsticks.
[00:44:43.672 --> 00:44:44.392]  It's the same thing.
[00:44:44.912 --> 00:44:48.833]  But imagine seeing footage where they practice mowing down whole families.
[00:44:51.132 --> 00:44:56.137]  Of course, I do have similar footage in Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:44:57.198 --> 00:45:04.006]  They just say that they are American insurgents, and then we have them interrogating survivors, role players, and they say, you know, where are you from?
[00:45:04.066 --> 00:45:05.267]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:45:05.307 --> 00:45:06.288]  Where'd you get the equipment?
[00:45:06.308 --> 00:45:06.929]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[00:45:06.949 --> 00:45:07.589]  Where'd you get the gun?
[00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:09.672]  Oh, I got it, you know, in San Francisco.
[00:45:10.472 --> 00:45:11.253]  Who are you under?
[00:45:11.313 --> 00:45:12.735]  Which militia leader are you under?
[00:45:15.606 --> 00:45:19.267]  So, I mean, what are they planning that they know we're going to fight them?
[00:45:19.387 --> 00:45:20.887]  They're going to take your farm.
[00:45:21.027 --> 00:45:22.087]  They're going to take your ranch.
[00:45:22.488 --> 00:45:24.028]  They're going to take your apartment complex.
[00:45:24.068 --> 00:45:25.108]  They're going to take your house.
[00:45:25.648 --> 00:45:27.649]  They're probably going to take your daughter if they want her.
[00:45:28.129 --> 00:45:29.709]  This is what tyranny is like.
[00:45:29.789 --> 00:45:30.689]  You want to live under it?
[00:45:31.129 --> 00:45:37.891]  Most people do in China, Russia, Germany, in the medieval times in England, France,
[00:45:38.573 --> 00:45:39.934]  This is how you live in Cuba.
[00:45:40.294 --> 00:45:41.935]  This is how you live in these places.
[00:45:42.015 --> 00:45:45.838]  And believe me, you're going to get to have a big serving of it.
[00:45:45.858 --> 00:45:49.720]  Of course, they probably won't have to take your daughter.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.242]  The media and the TV will make all these thugs the stars.
[00:45:53.178 --> 00:46:02.024]  And many women will think it's really cool if he was their boyfriend who stomps around in knee-high black boots and black uniforms.
[00:46:02.064 --> 00:46:03.125]  Oh, he's so sharp!
[00:46:03.205 --> 00:46:09.109]  A lot of these cowardly people in America will just subconsciously decide to join it.
[00:46:10.242 --> 00:46:10.382]  I think?
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:34.482]  Literally, people every minute of the military swaggering around with their fatigues, hanging out with a hamburger and a cigarette in one hand.
[00:46:34.522 --> 00:46:36.082]  We have photos of them that they posted.
[00:46:36.402 --> 00:46:40.163]  And then they go up to three-year-old children and search their bags and the children cry.
[00:46:40.183 --> 00:46:46.005]  Just randomly creeps driving around with machine guns mounted on Humvees, feeding on us.
[00:46:47.985 --> 00:46:49.226]  So that's in martial law.
[00:46:53.490 --> 00:47:10.060]  I mean, I sit here and I watch them preparing us, training us, how to go into slavery, putting fences up around schools, thumb scans to get in, parents retina scanning to get in to get their children, thumb scanners going in tanning salons, thumb scanners and retina scanners going in the health clubs, going in the libraries.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:22.008]  Going in the schools, going in the corporations, going in the HEBs, and some HEBs in College Station in Houston making you thumb scan to buy and sell, but starting a couple years ago just for all the employees making them do it.
[00:47:22.328 --> 00:47:25.130]  Cops having to thumb scan us to get into their squad car.
[00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:31.614]  Now cops all over the country, Illinois, Kansas, other areas, saying they're going to thumb scan you whenever you get pulled over.
[00:47:31.854 --> 00:47:38.478]  Federal database, federal control, face scanning cameras, transponders going in the inspection stickers, international toll road grids.
[00:47:40.996 --> 00:47:53.388]  These crooks are setting up their control system while leaving the border wide open, while letting millions of illegal aliens rampage around, beating people up with the American flag, tearing it up, flying giant Mexican flags.
[00:47:53.468 --> 00:47:54.389]  Oh, it's so funny.
[00:47:54.609 --> 00:47:55.430]  That's not a threat.
[00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:56.371]  That's not a problem.
[00:47:56.591 --> 00:47:59.674]  But if you're a property rights activist, you're going to a prison camp.
[00:48:00.254 --> 00:48:03.595]  Don't you try to protest us taking your land, because you're a terrorist!
[00:48:03.855 --> 00:48:06.495]  Don't you wear a Peace on Earth shirt, we're going to arrest you!
[00:48:06.775 --> 00:48:11.896]  Don't you go to the parade route of Bush and have a sign saying, Bush, stop the war!
[00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:15.057]  You'll be arrested, but people that are pro-war are allowed to stay!
[00:48:15.317 --> 00:48:26.219]  And the pro-war people go on sickening neocon Soviet websites like Free Republic, which is a travesty and abomination, and snicker and laugh at all of this, and just, we love George Bush!
[00:48:26.519 --> 00:48:27.199]  Oh, we love him!
[00:48:27.379 --> 00:48:28.519]  Oh, he's so good!
[00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:28.839]  Oh!
[00:48:32.581 --> 00:48:33.261]  It's sick.
[00:48:34.862 --> 00:48:35.502]  It's sick.
[00:48:35.982 --> 00:48:36.402]  You know why?
[00:48:36.422 --> 00:48:37.883]  Because you're scared deep down.
[00:48:37.923 --> 00:48:41.205]  The fake liberals out there, the fake conservatives, part of the false paradigm.
[00:48:42.105 --> 00:48:44.766]  You know everything I'm saying is true and you're scared deep down.
[00:48:44.786 --> 00:48:46.007]  You're upset deep down.
[00:48:46.067 --> 00:48:47.267]  You know we're in deep trouble.
[00:48:47.287 --> 00:48:50.809]  And I'm sitting here dumping all this on you because I'm upset I love this country.
[00:48:51.681 --> 00:49:16.455]  And to watch the most systematic, mechanized, crafted, focused, detailed, juggernaut of evil being manifest, being set up, to watch the grid going into place, to watch all the programs being laid, to watch the brainwashing, to watch the TV, the sitcoms, the dramas telling us torture's good, evil's good, secret arrest is good, equating it with safety, equating it with goodness,
[00:49:17.385 --> 00:49:22.749]  Actual Bush administration officials saying torturing children is good, even sexually, in front of their parents.
[00:49:22.909 --> 00:49:23.990]  I can't even believe that.
[00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.652]  That's right out of hell itself.
[00:49:27.193 --> 00:49:28.734]  Just total wickedness.
[00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:37.100]  And telling us through our fear, you'll be safe, we'll keep you safe from the terrorists, if you just go along with giving up all your freedom.
[00:49:38.755 --> 00:49:47.583]  But we're going to keep the border wide open, and we're going to have an amnesty to legalize all of them and bring in more, and we're going to give the Communist Chinese military.
[00:49:48.283 --> 00:49:51.986]  I know there are cops listening right now, giggling and laughing because you believe in the system.
[00:49:53.007 --> 00:49:53.588]  Listen to me.
[00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:58.612]  You just type in, Hong Kong Company to take over security at ports.
[00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:06.399]  And then when you go to that article, you type in, you type in Hutchinson Wampoa into Google, and you type in Congressional Reports.
[00:50:08.456 --> 00:50:28.708]  And you will have the admission that the company is chaired by a former Chinese general, that every captain of every ship and every security detail is a member of the Communist Chinese Navy, and that his entire staff is Navy, and that they carry large contingents of troops on board in weapons and drug smuggling L.A.
[00:50:28.748 --> 00:50:29.168]  times.
[00:50:30.969 --> 00:50:32.030]  They have now masked
[00:50:33.206 --> 00:50:35.728]  Upwards of 30,000 troops in Panama.
[00:50:36.088 --> 00:50:40.891]  They are now taking over the deep water port, the major port of the entire Bahamas chain.
[00:50:42.131 --> 00:50:48.575]  They are now, the customs is now moving out and the communist military is moving in to run security on our port.
[00:50:49.576 --> 00:50:50.076]  Our island.
[00:50:50.776 --> 00:50:51.757]  Our chain of islands.
[00:50:52.638 --> 00:50:56.140]  And that is the exact, total truth.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:57.720]  Unbelievable.
[00:51:01.818 --> 00:51:04.660]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.501]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:06.841 --> 00:51:11.524]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:11.865 --> 00:51:18.589]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:20.911]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.953]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.053 --> 00:51:28.717]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:28.917 --> 00:51:33.321]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:33.561 --> 00:51:40.787]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.028 --> 00:51:43.490]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.111]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:51:45.271 --> 00:51:47.834]  ...or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:52:00.896 --> 00:52:07.138]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.278 --> 00:52:13.440]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:22.163]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.403 --> 00:52:29.425]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.725 --> 00:52:34.548]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.768 --> 00:52:40.132]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.512 --> 00:52:43.594]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:43.935 --> 00:52:51.900]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.520]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.847 --> 00:53:02.427]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.498 --> 00:53:17.879]  I think so.
[00:53:37.697 --> 00:53:38.497]  We don't need no education
[00:54:25.078 --> 00:54:34.162]  By the way, we have the former director of the Star Wars program, who himself is saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:54:35.203 --> 00:54:38.364]  You understand this high-level Space Command Air Force officer
[00:54:40.026 --> 00:54:47.152]  The head of the Star Wars program is joining us on Monday to talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:54:49.054 --> 00:54:55.019]  You know, I'm going to have the former Delta Force commander, one of the founders of Delta Force, on in the next few weeks.
[00:54:55.039 --> 00:54:55.780]  We're setting him up.
[00:54:56.961 --> 00:54:59.023]  He has said America is going into a police state.
[00:54:59.043 --> 00:55:00.784]  He has said the war on terror is fake.
[00:55:01.205 --> 00:55:05.869]  He has said that our government is fomenting revolution by design in Iraq because
[00:55:06.889 --> 00:55:09.851]  The former commander of Delta Force can read their own battle plans.
[00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:11.752]  I mean, that's all we do here.
[00:55:13.153 --> 00:55:17.316]  You understand that people that love America know the truth right now?
[00:55:17.336 --> 00:55:20.197]  You understand I have chills going up and down my spine again.
[00:55:20.658 --> 00:55:22.058]  I literally am having chills right now.
[00:55:22.579 --> 00:55:29.803]  The Communist Chinese Navy is taking over security in the biggest port in the Caribbean.
[00:55:30.804 --> 00:55:32.385]  A massive deep-water island
[00:55:34.508 --> 00:55:50.876]  When the ships that have such a deep draw, I forget the exact name of the terminal, I'll pop it in my head in a second, that can't even navigate into a whole bunch of different ports and countries in the Caribbean.
[00:55:50.896 --> 00:55:53.277]  I mean, it is the biggest port, bigger than anything we've got in the U.S.
[00:55:54.218 --> 00:55:54.998]  And the U.S.
[00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:55.398]  owns it.
[00:55:55.739 --> 00:55:56.879]  We own it.
[00:55:57.459 --> 00:55:58.380]  It's our group of islands.
[00:55:59.216 --> 00:56:02.239]  It is being given to the Communist Chinese military.
[00:56:02.279 --> 00:56:03.339]  Go read the Associated Press.
[00:56:03.379 --> 00:56:10.725]  It says, in an unprecedented, no-bid contract, the first time a foreign country is going to run security, and the customs won't even be there.
[00:56:11.706 --> 00:56:13.047]  With the big radiation detectors.
[00:56:14.888 --> 00:56:18.411]  Run by the Chinese military that openly threatens to nuke us on a routine basis.
[00:56:18.471 --> 00:56:25.116]  Just type in, Chinese general threatens to nuke America, and you'll get Times of London, you'll get Associated Press, what, that was six months ago.
[00:56:26.297 --> 00:56:26.798]  Or less.
[00:56:26.818 --> 00:56:28.179]  I mean, they do it every few months.
[00:56:29.091 --> 00:56:34.934]  Saying, here, 200 cities, he called a press conference, had a big map up, 200 cities are targeted with ICBMs right now.
[00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:39.596]  If you get involved in any of our national interests, we will preemptively strike you.
[00:56:40.036 --> 00:56:40.656]  Oh, great!
[00:56:41.137 --> 00:56:43.378]  Here, mass troops in Panama.
[00:56:43.998 --> 00:56:45.759]  Oh, here, take over our port.
[00:56:46.139 --> 00:56:47.560]  Oh, here, run security at it.
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.301]  Will you threaten to nuke us again, please?
[00:56:51.782 --> 00:56:53.442]  I mean, you understand that.
[00:56:54.143 --> 00:56:56.564]  I mean, can you even begin to imagine
[00:56:57.572 --> 00:56:59.053]  The magnitude of that.
[00:56:59.153 --> 00:57:10.839]  By the way, about 15 minutes ago, the moron phone company that put in our lines and then turned them off and then took them five days to get it back on, we now have 1-800 lines again.
[00:57:13.266 --> 00:57:17.988]  But there's something else screwed up when you deal with this stuff.
[00:57:18.488 --> 00:57:21.069]  So we should be able to take 1-800 calls by the end of the show.
[00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:22.090]  I certainly hope so.
[00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:24.391]  Because I'm chomping at the bit to be able to take your calls.
[00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:25.992]  I can easily talk for three hours.
[00:57:26.032 --> 00:57:27.192]  I've got a lot of news to cover here.
[00:57:27.452 --> 00:57:31.814]  But I want to get your take on Communist Chinese military taking over more and more.
[00:57:31.834 --> 00:57:33.175]  I mean, they've already got Long Beach.
[00:57:33.635 --> 00:57:34.976]  Some company's got that.
[00:57:34.996 --> 00:57:36.096]  They've already got Panama Canal.
[00:57:36.116 --> 00:57:38.797]  Now they're getting this other one that's even more important.
[00:57:41.218 --> 00:57:42.639]  I just cannot believe it anymore.
[00:57:43.488 --> 00:57:50.670]  And I want to talk about the rampaging illegal aliens, and I want to get into more and more FBI agents getting indicted for drug dealing and murder.
[00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.510]  I mean, this is just par for the course.
[00:57:53.191 --> 00:57:55.811]  I want to get into all of it today, and we will.
[00:57:56.772 --> 00:57:58.412]  And there's so much more coming up in the next hour.
[00:57:58.432 --> 00:58:03.273]  I want to get into Ritalin, killing the kids, and some good news on vitamin C, and just a lot of other issues.
[00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:05.494]  Before I end this hour and the next 30 seconds,
[00:58:06.687 --> 00:58:10.450]  The last few days of almost half a year free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:18.076]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv and find out how you get five months free for the incredible service that also makes what we do here possible.
[00:58:18.997 --> 00:58:19.697]  You understand, folks?
[00:58:21.118 --> 00:58:22.920]  It is 5.3 months free.
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.781]  Almost half a year free when you sign up for a year.
[00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:25.442]  So you pay for six
[00:58:27.176 --> 00:58:27.737]  6.7 months.
[00:58:27.757 --> 00:58:31.460]  You pay for a little over six months and you get five months free.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.602]  Or go get a $5.95 monthly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:34.642 --> 00:58:36.383]  Or go to InfoWars.com to get hard copies.
[00:58:36.864 --> 00:58:37.624]  Second hour coming up.
[00:58:40.546 --> 00:58:45.190]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:56.468 --> 00:58:57.128]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.788 --> 00:58:58.849]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.549 --> 00:59:00.669]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:02.130]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:04.391]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:08.272]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.632 --> 00:59:12.774]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.956 --> 00:59:20.537]  The New World Order is a global crime syndicate.
[00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:33.981]  And they've taken over America, and they're now handing over the entire infrastructure to themselves, and passing laws and getting courts to rule that we own no private property, and that they can use private mercenaries to oppress us and kill us, and put us in private FEMA camps.
[00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:35.022]  They even charge us for that.
[00:59:36.143 --> 00:59:37.964]  So, uh, we've been talking about that also.
[00:59:38.025 --> 00:59:39.906]  Ex-FBI agent indicted in mob killings.
[00:59:39.946 --> 00:59:40.807]  That's in New York.
[00:59:41.167 --> 00:59:43.189]  They've been convicted up in Boston for it.
[00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:45.371]  And it's the same all over the country.
[00:59:45.391 --> 00:59:48.694]  I mean, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[00:59:49.372 --> 00:59:53.854]  See, crime can operate unimpeded in government.
[00:59:53.874 --> 00:59:55.595]  It's always the most dangerous thing.
[00:59:55.635 --> 00:59:57.336]  It's always the most abusive.
[00:59:57.356 --> 00:59:58.696]  It's always the most destructive.
[00:59:59.497 --> 01:00:00.797]  And now it's happening again.
[01:00:03.799 --> 01:00:04.779]  I'm going to give you an update.
[01:00:04.879 --> 01:00:15.524]  Chairman Thomas Kean is going to be up in Georgetown in one hour and fifteen minutes, roughly, giving a speech at that university up there.
[01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:15.604]  And
[01:00:19.423 --> 01:00:28.009]  He's the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, but since I missed two days this week because the network wasn't able to go live, I just couldn't miss talking to millions of listeners.
[01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:34.894]  So I'm not going to it, but there are some cameras up there and other locals are going up there to cover what happens.
[01:00:35.434 --> 01:00:40.377]  There's going to be a press conference at 1-15, so by the end of the show, perhaps my
[01:00:45.054 --> 01:00:45.494]  Excuse me.
[01:00:46.014 --> 01:00:51.476]  Perhaps some of my folks that are going to be there covering it can call in and tell us how the press conference went.
[01:00:51.516 --> 01:00:56.377]  So, we'll give you a report on that, hopefully, near the end of the third hour as well.
[01:00:56.437 --> 01:00:58.318]  So, gentlemen, I know you're listening out there.
[01:00:58.338 --> 01:01:01.639]  You've got your walking orders on that.
[01:01:03.799 --> 01:01:08.261]  Appreciate all the fine folks, Bob Dacey and others, for going up there to cover this event.
[01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:10.581]  That should be interesting, to say the least.
[01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:15.696]  Look at some of the other news I've got here.
[01:01:15.736 --> 01:01:18.577]  Senate panel set to consider bid to censure Bush.
[01:01:18.597 --> 01:01:19.177]  We'll get into that.
[01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:24.598]  Akron Director Ed Asner shares 9-11 concerns, agrees that the 9-11 Commission is a hoax and a whitewash.
[01:01:25.699 --> 01:01:26.339]  We'll get into that.
[01:01:27.739 --> 01:01:37.001]  We'll also get into our groundbreaking interview yesterday with William Rodriguez and the billionaire philanthropist Jimmy Walters, who are in Caracas.
[01:01:37.825 --> 01:01:43.207]  Enter the capital of Venezuela, and they're scheduled to be meeting with the President Hugo Chavez this weekend.
[01:01:43.548 --> 01:01:48.590]  They've already met with the President of the National Assembly, who's totally aware of 9-11, and then it was an inside job.
[01:01:50.030 --> 01:02:00.915]  Also, a report here that the sniveling liberal that all the neocons love, their darling, the gun-grabbing, camera-promoting, one-world-government-spouting Blair will be gone by Christmas, say friends.
[01:02:00.975 --> 01:02:01.836]  London Telegraph.
[01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:07.198]  I guess he's outlived his usefulness for them.
[01:02:08.323 --> 01:02:12.927]  And we'll also get into a defiant Iran rejects new U.N.
[01:02:12.967 --> 01:02:13.367]  demands.
[01:02:13.848 --> 01:02:14.788]  As we said, the U.N.
[01:02:14.848 --> 01:02:17.270]  is claiming now that they can't enrich uranium.
[01:02:17.631 --> 01:02:21.193]  They said they could before, but, you know, global government tells you what you can do.
[01:02:21.233 --> 01:02:22.214]  It's admittedly peaceful.
[01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:34.324]  CIA's own long-term assessment says ten years, and they were allowed to get the parts they need, thousands of centrifuges and other things, which can clearly be tracked and stopped, but they won't have an A-bomb, primitive A-bomb, for a decade.
[01:02:34.444 --> 01:02:36.646]  Well, I guess that was a year ago, so now for nine years.
[01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:41.253]  But that doesn't matter, they're beating the war drum, getting everything lined up to attack them.
[01:02:42.534 --> 01:02:46.616]  And start World War III, so we'll get into that as well.
[01:02:46.656 --> 01:02:51.639]  And the Army Band's use of privately bought body armor, we'll cover that as well.
[01:02:51.719 --> 01:02:59.363]  You're stuck with me, ladies and gentlemen, but we should have the phone lines later in the broadcast, or by Monday.
[01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:06.347]  Give the hair, lips, the Admiral come hell or high water, as they say, to use the old British terms.
[01:03:08.061 --> 01:03:18.063]  Now, I also want to get more into some of the ongoing rioting and tantrum-throwing by the illegal aliens running around, and some of the false information.
[01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:32.725]  I was watching News 8 yesterday, or locally, and they had, you know, the high school and middle school students playing hooky, rampaging around, waving Mexican flags, no American flags anywhere, saying, this is Mexico, we're taking over, ha ha ha, you're gonna take it.
[01:03:33.585 --> 01:03:34.806]  So, it's just real sick.
[01:03:34.846 --> 01:03:37.266]  I mean, if Mexico's so good, go move down there and be slaves!
[01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:41.910]  No, I mean, they've had a mafia running that government forever, so... Don't worry!
[01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:43.571]  America will be destroyed, too!
[01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:45.553]  Don't worry, you can help do it!
[01:03:46.853 --> 01:03:48.154]  Listen, don't worry!
[01:03:48.174 --> 01:03:51.296]  I'm sure you'll be successful, you've got government brains!
[01:03:52.117 --> 01:03:56.459]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:56.639 --> 01:04:01.062]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:01.222 --> 01:04:05.565]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:06.986]  The New World Order.
[01:04:07.526 --> 01:04:09.148]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:32.846]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:33.106 --> 01:04:38.487]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:13.066]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:13.407 --> 01:05:18.230]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:19.130]  ...are no problem.
[01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:26.013]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:26.233 --> 01:05:33.035]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:59.343]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:02.946]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.363 --> 01:07:08.804]  I've been getting a lot of calls and emails, sir, at the office.
[01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:13.806]  Hey, did you hear they took down the American flag in Houston and ran up the Mexican flag at a public school?
[01:07:13.966 --> 01:07:14.867]  Yes, we heard about it.
[01:07:15.087 --> 01:07:16.047]  We covered it yesterday.
[01:07:16.888 --> 01:07:23.431]  Have you heard about them taking down American flags at buildings and apartment complexes and businesses all over and flying the Mexican flag?
[01:07:23.531 --> 01:07:25.131]  Yes, believe me, I live here in Austin.
[01:07:25.171 --> 01:07:25.872]  I know all about it.
[01:07:27.212 --> 01:07:28.373]  Anyway, have you heard about this?
[01:07:28.393 --> 01:07:29.113]  Have you heard about that?
[01:07:29.193 --> 01:07:35.056]  Do you understand that seven South Texas towns for at least eight years
[01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:38.889]  Fly the Mexican flag and English is not allowed.
[01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:42.575]  And again, one of the towns that comes to mind the first to do it is El Cenizo.
[01:07:44.277 --> 01:07:49.385]  And no English is allowed in court proceedings, Spanish is only on the buildings, and they say it is Mexico.
[01:07:50.416 --> 01:08:12.345]  Now, can you imagine if, say, a predominantly Czechoslovakian town in Austin, I mean in Texas, outside Austin, there are a lot of them, said, we're taking down the American flag, we're going to fly the Czech Republic flag, and we are not going to allow English in our police department or at the courthouse, because, you know, there are courthouses based in the county seats of Czech towns or German towns.
[01:08:12.365 --> 01:08:19.028]  What if Fredericksburg, founded by Germans in 1844, founded by a German prince, what if they ran up the flag of the
[01:08:19.967 --> 01:08:20.767]  German Republic.
[01:08:21.608 --> 01:08:36.733]  Let's say they ran up the double-headed eagle, and they ran that sucker up, or they ran up the single-headed eagle, the black eagle, and they ran that up and they said, only German, only Deutsch, is allowed here in Fredericksburg, Texas.
[01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:50.837]  Can you imagine the national convulsions, the Feds, the EEOC coming in, discrimination, the lawsuits, the Feds would take the courthouse over, there'd be National Guard going in like they did with the little black kids to get in the schools.
[01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:56.400]  But man, when they run Mexican flags up and say no gringos in this city, it's good.
[01:08:56.421 --> 01:09:01.784]  I mean, they just sit there and they say it's just wonderful.
[01:09:03.325 --> 01:09:05.406]  It's absolutely fabulous.
[01:09:06.596 --> 01:09:07.817]  It's a good thing.
[01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:11.580]  You see, a lot of you are figuring out how bad this is.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:22.187]  I mean, up major highways yesterday, highways were getting shut down yesterday with thousands of people running around with giant Mexican flags screaming down with America.
[01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:24.689]  I mean, it was on the news.
[01:09:25.919 --> 01:09:31.123]  Of course the news would say they care about immigrants and they're upset that all Hispanics are going to be deported.
[01:09:31.203 --> 01:09:32.124]  I actually have this on tape.
[01:09:32.464 --> 01:09:34.065]  We were taping it here in the office from News 8.
[01:09:34.446 --> 01:09:38.469]  And then we have people who can speak Spanish who were watching the tape going on and they're saying, this is Mexico, get out!
[01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:41.151]  Because see, it's a perfect takeover.
[01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:43.993]  Imagine having 30 million illegal aliens.
[01:09:44.968 --> 01:09:51.134]  24 million of those, according to federal and private numbers, that are Latin American, and about 20 million of those are Mexicans.
[01:09:51.714 --> 01:10:11.211]  Another 6 million that are Chinese and Arabic, and they're all here, the Chinese really are, they're all here saying, we're going to take over America, America's going down, and the stupid Americans, who are Hispanics, who speak English predominantly, you know, who are more Texan than I am, you can't get any more Texan than a Hispanic Texan, a Spanish Texan,
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.843]  And blacks and whites, we have no idea what's going on.
[01:10:16.163 --> 01:10:23.408]  It was my Mexican-American friends years ago, a decade ago, that alerted me to, hey, you know what's in this Mexican newspaper, Alex?
[01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:24.489]  We've got a whole bunch here in Austin.
[01:10:24.789 --> 01:10:26.230]  Hey, do you know what's on the side of that business?
[01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:27.531]  Hey, do you know what that is, my friend?
[01:10:27.952 --> 01:10:30.754]  My friend, do you know what that t-shirt says?
[01:10:30.794 --> 01:10:32.075]  That's the plan of San Diego.
[01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.557]  That means that they're going to kill all whites above 16.
[01:10:34.977 --> 01:10:35.578]  And I'm like, no.
[01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:42.615]  And then another individual walks over and goes, no, no, I'm a professor at the UT History Department.
[01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:43.136]  He's right.
[01:10:43.616 --> 01:10:44.837]  That's the plan of San Diego.
[01:10:44.897 --> 01:10:48.540]  I typed it into Google that night, and my jaw starts hitting the floor and bouncing.
[01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:50.582]  I am to be killed.
[01:10:50.802 --> 01:10:51.583]  I am to be murdered.
[01:10:51.703 --> 01:10:54.785]  I am to be lined up and put in a death camp and have my head blown off.
[01:10:55.906 --> 01:10:58.088]  And when my son is 16, he is to be murdered.
[01:10:59.364 --> 01:11:07.308]  And the Texas Civil Rights Review comes out and goes, yeah, there's a plan to kill you, Alex, but they're a down-trodden group and you're bad to say it's bad.
[01:11:07.508 --> 01:11:09.309]  They actually say that.
[01:11:09.749 --> 01:11:17.093]  I'm sitting here with millions of people openly saying they plan to murder me and murder my family.
[01:11:17.713 --> 01:11:19.794]  And I'm bad because I'm against it.
[01:11:21.064 --> 01:11:23.646]  I mean this is how insane, you think I'm kidding?
[01:11:24.106 --> 01:11:42.497]  I'm not kidding when it's in the Associated Press saying no bid contract, first time foreign country, there will be no customs there, our Bahamas deep water port, owned by the United States, used to be run by the Communist Chinese Navy.
[01:11:44.364 --> 01:11:50.987]  Now, again, the Associated Press, Washington Times, they all report, well, congressional reports, there are between 15,000 and 30,000.
[01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:54.628]  I say that because they rotate them in and out.
[01:11:55.108 --> 01:11:58.110]  At one time, the Chinese says there's 30,000 and they say there's 15,000.
[01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:00.291]  Reports are it's even higher.
[01:12:01.331 --> 01:12:03.412]  In the Panama Isthmus, in Panama,
[01:12:04.235 --> 01:12:06.256]  They took over the military bases we built.
[01:12:06.377 --> 01:12:09.179]  They took over the canal we built.
[01:12:09.239 --> 01:12:11.900]  The French tried for seven years and failed.
[01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:13.041]  I forget the numbers.
[01:12:13.061 --> 01:12:15.343]  There's something like 100,000 construction workers died.
[01:12:15.363 --> 01:12:17.625]  I mean, it just, it was unbelievable.
[01:12:18.365 --> 01:12:20.887]  We did it, we built it, and then it was given.
[01:12:22.873 --> 01:12:24.133]  They didn't even pay for it.
[01:12:24.233 --> 01:12:25.294]  That's trilateralism.
[01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:31.675]  It was given in 2000 to the communist Chinese military.
[01:12:31.755 --> 01:12:33.916]  Now they're taking over the big Bahamas port.
[01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:35.876]  The big deep water port in the Bahamas.
[01:12:37.296 --> 01:12:37.976]  Mainstream news!
[01:12:39.177 --> 01:12:48.379]  And we have millions of illegal aliens charging around, flapping that disgusting, murdering, enslaved flag.
[01:12:48.399 --> 01:12:48.879]  You know something?
[01:12:52.157 --> 01:12:54.459]  I believe Nazi culture is evil.
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.461]  And I have received stuff that looks like it's out of the movies.
[01:12:59.482 --> 01:13:07.046]  You know, the handwritten thing where some psychopath sits there and cuts out different letters from different magazines and it says, you're gonna get it, goy boy.
[01:13:07.406 --> 01:13:08.887]  You're gonna get it, Jew lover.
[01:13:09.748 --> 01:13:10.808]  You're gonna die.
[01:13:11.849 --> 01:13:17.152]  All because I say that I believe the Nazi culture was evil.
[01:13:19.033 --> 01:13:25.036]  They wore black uniforms, as all assassins and executioners and followers of Saturn have always done.
[01:13:25.096 --> 01:13:26.277]  Yes, Saturn, Satan.
[01:13:28.078 --> 01:13:29.418]  That's the predominant cult.
[01:13:29.818 --> 01:13:38.163]  If you use the Roman term, the Latin term, well, it's Saturn in Latin.
[01:13:39.523 --> 01:13:43.645]  If you use the ancient, the Romantic language term, it is the cult of Saturn.
[01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:46.367]  They wore the uniform of the cult of Saturn,
[01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:52.712]  They have the twin lightning bolt in runes for double lightning, double power.
[01:13:53.232 --> 01:13:56.773]  Also in Satanism, the symbol for Satan coming down to earth, falling from heaven.
[01:13:57.814 --> 01:14:03.756]  Hitler admittedly, this is Nazi's own documents, this is not made up, this is admitted, was into deep occult activities.
[01:14:03.796 --> 01:14:06.297]  He was part of the Thule Society.
[01:14:07.397 --> 01:14:14.440]  The organizations that now have a chapel at the UN.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.301]  He did kill tens of millions of people.
[01:14:18.999 --> 01:14:22.620]  He was evil, and his culture was evil.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:23.920]  It was a culture of death.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.581]  They wore the death's head on their caps.
[01:14:26.321 --> 01:14:27.221]  It was an evil culture.
[01:14:27.241 --> 01:14:39.084]  And I'm here to tell you that the dominant Mesoamerican, La Reconquista, Mayan culture is as evil as any culture I've ever seen.
[01:14:39.124 --> 01:14:40.744]  It is more evil than the Nazis.
[01:14:41.613 --> 01:14:43.174]  In fact, I've studied ancient cultures.
[01:14:43.214 --> 01:14:43.914]  I've studied the Romans.
[01:14:43.954 --> 01:14:44.615]  I've studied the Greeks.
[01:14:44.655 --> 01:14:46.376]  I've studied the Persians.
[01:14:46.476 --> 01:14:47.896]  I've studied the Babylonians.
[01:14:48.357 --> 01:14:49.477]  I have studied the Canaanites.
[01:14:49.557 --> 01:14:50.738]  I have studied the Israelites.
[01:14:51.038 --> 01:14:52.139]  I have studied the Hebrews.
[01:14:52.479 --> 01:14:53.960]  I have studied the ancient Chinese.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.801]  I have studied the Visigoth, the Franks.
[01:14:56.161 --> 01:14:59.223]  I have studied the Saxon, the Anglo-Saxon.
[01:14:59.363 --> 01:15:00.203]  I have studied them all.
[01:15:01.044 --> 01:15:11.009]  No one ever got closer to literal Clive Barker... Clive Barker type
[01:15:13.022 --> 01:15:14.042]  Cinebite evil.
[01:15:15.283 --> 01:15:16.504]  Hellraiser evil.
[01:15:17.204 --> 01:15:38.355]  The reality of daily life in a temple city in Southern North America or Central America or North America was so hellish and so dark and so powerful that it is the most satanic evil force I have ever looked at.
[01:15:39.173 --> 01:15:53.344]  Let me just tell you, because this is what they've chosen, that they chose the Apache, the proud, strong, you know, six-foot-something, powerful, intelligent, uh, you know, Conquistadors would shoot four or five arrows at them and they wouldn't go down.
[01:15:53.725 --> 01:16:06.555]  The Conquistadors could just shove down the Mayans, because they used to be and look and be the same bloodline as the Apaches, the Arapaho, the Blackfoot, the Comanches, noble, noble, Asiatic people.
[01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:09.551]  Wild Asians is what they are.
[01:16:09.751 --> 01:16:10.931]  Came across the Bering Strait.
[01:16:11.411 --> 01:16:12.431]  Exact same genetic.
[01:16:13.112 --> 01:16:17.893]  You know, they've got the mongoloid blue spots on their backs.
[01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:18.293]  Everything.
[01:16:20.094 --> 01:16:20.554]  Guaranteed.
[01:16:21.174 --> 01:16:23.315]  This incredibly noble people.
[01:16:24.715 --> 01:16:26.356]  And look what Satan did to them.
[01:16:27.396 --> 01:16:35.079]  They went from 6'1", on average, from skeletal remains of Plains Indians, down to an average height of 5 feet.
[01:16:37.256 --> 01:16:42.220]  Now, I don't care how tall you are, I'm not that tall myself, but this is the warping of the New World Order.
[01:16:44.562 --> 01:16:51.067]  Because they worshipped a god that looked a certain way, anyone who didn't have a certain facial features was killed.
[01:16:52.047 --> 01:16:55.250]  Anyone who was tall, because the gods wanted one tall, were killed.
[01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.271]  Anyone who was intelligent was killed.
[01:16:57.772 --> 01:16:59.413]  Anyone who resisted was killed.
[01:16:59.813 --> 01:17:05.918]  The person who won the sporting event, the ball playing court that I've been to at Cheech & Meech Center and other courts, was killed.
[01:17:07.521 --> 01:17:16.424]  They would take their firstborn child, in all cases, and the priest would eat the heart and the family would then cut up their child and eat them.
[01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:21.345]  Folks, the Mayan... I mean, I've been all over the place.
[01:17:21.365 --> 01:17:22.706]  I was just down there a few months ago.
[01:17:22.726 --> 01:17:23.546]  I went down there for a few days.
[01:17:26.104 --> 01:17:30.568]  I was down in Costa Maya, in some of the newly unearthed ruins.
[01:17:30.768 --> 01:17:31.509]  I'm going to talk about this.
[01:17:31.549 --> 01:17:32.650]  I've never really talked about this.
[01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:37.854]  And here was, they had archaeologists, degreed archaeologists, who were Mayan, who thought it was great.
[01:17:37.874 --> 01:17:38.835]  In fact, I even sat there.
[01:17:39.135 --> 01:17:40.676]  There were fans, by the way, on the tour bus.
[01:17:41.117 --> 01:17:41.837]  I had a lot of them.
[01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.158]  Two different groups were on the tour bus.
[01:17:43.198 --> 01:17:44.500]  The listeners to the show was amazing.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.163]  And I'm down there, and I'm videotaping it.
[01:17:48.323 --> 01:17:49.544]  I've even got videotape of this.
[01:17:51.384 --> 01:17:53.765]  And the different tour guides are saying it's good.
[01:17:53.845 --> 01:17:54.765]  Sacrifice is good.
[01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:56.266]  And it's not an evil culture.
[01:17:56.406 --> 01:17:57.046]  And they got mad at me.
[01:17:57.066 --> 01:17:58.187]  I said, no, it is an evil culture.
[01:17:58.327 --> 01:18:00.027]  And we had to go through police checkpoints, of course.
[01:18:00.227 --> 01:18:02.368]  They said that wasn't a police state.
[01:18:02.668 --> 01:18:07.650]  Guys with machine guns searching us and searching other vehicles there in Costa Maya near the Guatemala border.
[01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:14.932]  So when we get back, I'm going to get into some other news later, but when we get back, I'm going to describe to you what they did.
[01:18:16.253 --> 01:18:19.054]  They would take drugs to cause painful hallucinations.
[01:18:19.776 --> 01:18:26.040]  And then take large ropes full of giant pieces of glass and pull it through their genitalia.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.762]  They would take nails and drive them through their fingers.
[01:18:29.862 --> 01:18:31.222]  Beat their fingers with hammers.
[01:18:31.382 --> 01:18:32.863]  Blood dripping everywhere.
[01:18:32.983 --> 01:18:36.725]  Giant demonic idols.
[01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:37.966]  10,000 people once a year.
[01:18:38.446 --> 01:18:40.287]  Piles of dead bodies everywhere.
[01:18:40.367 --> 01:18:41.668]  Huge piles of hearts.
[01:18:42.228 --> 01:18:45.370]  Priests sleeping in beds of hearts and intestines.
[01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:48.472]  Giant satanic beast systems.
[01:18:54.508 --> 01:18:56.149]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:56.749 --> 01:18:58.550]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:07.554]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:07.794 --> 01:19:10.415]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:10.395 --> 01:19:11.816]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:11.976 --> 01:19:18.899]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:19.159 --> 01:19:22.161]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.

[01:19:52.108 --> 01:19:58.311]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:58.772 --> 01:20:06.556]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:06.896 --> 01:20:14.780]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:19.823]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:20.143 --> 01:20:24.870]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:29.235]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:29.736 --> 01:20:30.737]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:30.817 --> 01:20:34.863]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:20:35.303 --> 01:20:39.686]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:20:40.206 --> 01:20:42.768]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:45.770]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:47.111 --> 01:20:48.592]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.632 --> 01:20:56.577]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:20:56.757 --> 01:20:58.838]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:20:59.079 --> 01:21:04.202]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase.
[01:21:04.582 --> 01:21:06.184]  Handbag or glove compartment.
[01:21:06.304 --> 01:21:17.856]  The Berkey solar charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:21:18.236 --> 01:21:19.718]  It's multi-voltage capability
[01:21:19.718 --> 01:21:25.602]  These multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:30.866]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:21:31.006 --> 01:21:36.010]  Disconnect your application and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:42.375]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:42.395 --> 01:21:46.458]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:21:46.738 --> 01:21:47.739]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:52.163 --> 01:21:54.646]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:55.207 --> 01:22:03.276]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[01:22:04.097 --> 01:22:09.083]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:17.240]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:21.767]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[01:22:21.787 --> 01:22:25.972]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[01:22:26.873 --> 01:22:31.258]  And offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:31.839 --> 01:22:33.340]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:33.801]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:33.861 --> 01:22:34.281]  Call now.
[01:22:34.542 --> 01:22:39.007]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:22:55.273 --> 01:22:55.793]  Don't worry.
[01:22:56.234 --> 01:22:57.774]  This show is documented.
[01:22:58.275 --> 01:23:01.036]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:01.457 --> 01:23:04.979]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:23:04.999 --> 01:23:06.239]  I went back online.
[01:23:06.339 --> 01:23:12.283]  The reason I first thought of the Nazi culture is that there are a lot of evil cultures.
[01:23:13.515 --> 01:23:17.258]  But these moral relativists try to say, no, no, no, no culture is evil.
[01:23:17.379 --> 01:23:26.366]  You can't say the Aztecs or Mayans or Toltecs or Olmecs, you can't say any of these people were evil because it was just their culture and it's from their own cultural view.
[01:23:26.386 --> 01:23:30.289]  But then that very liberal, I'll say, okay, then the Nazis' culture wasn't evil, that was their culture.
[01:23:30.469 --> 01:23:31.550]  Well, of course they were evil.
[01:23:33.591 --> 01:23:37.034]  Well, wait a minute, you can't have your cake and eat it too.
[01:23:37.154 --> 01:23:41.758]  So what they would do is they would go capture nearby tribes for the big sacrifices.
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:52.726]  And the Aztecs, when they took over much of the Mayan civilization about, what, 800 years ago, they exterminated... it was on a monthly basis they were killing 10,000 in a pop.
[01:23:53.427 --> 01:23:58.970]  10,000 was the number they seemed to like, but every day there were dozens and dozens of sacrifices.
[01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.972]  And again, your firstborn child was killed because it was seen as special.
[01:24:03.953 --> 01:24:07.575]  If you were smart, if you were tall, you were killed.
[01:24:07.755 --> 01:24:08.736]  This is admitted.
[01:24:09.736 --> 01:24:16.919]  This is admitted, and they've dug up the skeletons of Mesoamericans tens of thousands of years ago, and they're six feet tall.
[01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:33.525]  And by the time they were done, this stuff really accelerated 2,000 years ago, is when these civilizations developed into the larger pyramid societies, and the priesthood, and then after that the kings took over, who were also king-priests themselves.
[01:24:34.605 --> 01:24:37.086]  You saw the populations actually start going down
[01:24:38.112 --> 01:24:44.699]  And you saw the people having more diseases, less genetic variants, being much shorter.
[01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:49.244]  And you see elites do this throughout history.
[01:24:50.065 --> 01:24:58.714]  You would have the warrior caste, and you would have the priest class, who themselves, when they dig up the skeletons in the graves under the temples, they are six feet tall.
[01:24:59.292 --> 01:25:09.149]  And then they had literally done, just like the nobles 500 years ago in England, the average height was around 5 feet tall for a male, what about 4 foot 8 for a woman.
[01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:10.952]  I mean, we were little bitty people.
[01:25:11.727 --> 01:25:14.608]  That's why, you know, they can tell generally, it's like in Silas of the Lambs.
[01:25:14.668 --> 01:25:16.569]  It's actually based on real anthropology.
[01:25:16.969 --> 01:25:22.812]  When Hannibal says to her, he goes, ah, you know, you come from poor, you know, very poor grandparents.
[01:25:22.832 --> 01:25:24.932]  And after that, you can tell because she was short.
[01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:26.913]  And then you're thinking, oh, you know, what does that mean?
[01:25:26.933 --> 01:25:29.354]  That's actually based in nutrition levels.
[01:25:29.714 --> 01:25:33.756]  Nobles in China, nobles in Japan, nobles in Europe are all taller.
[01:25:34.426 --> 01:25:35.908]  Well, they went one further.
[01:25:35.968 --> 01:25:37.249]  You see, that's what feudalism is.
[01:25:37.269 --> 01:25:44.337]  We're keeping people on very small pieces of land, controlling them at subsistence level, so they don't get too uppity and controlling their breeding.
[01:25:44.457 --> 01:25:45.738]  Elites all have done this.
[01:25:46.018 --> 01:25:48.201]  It's the science of dominating populations.
[01:25:49.782 --> 01:25:56.850]  So imagine a population so enslaved that they shrink by 13 inches, on average,
[01:25:58.178 --> 01:26:12.248]  And they end up having much higher levels of disease and genetic defects and problems, which is now shown today in Indian or Mesoamerican populations, compared to their exact same genetic bloodline, over six feet tall.
[01:26:12.948 --> 01:26:17.031]  And I mean, it's just a fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:17.491 --> 01:26:19.293]  And I don't want to go into all the sacrifices.
[01:26:19.333 --> 01:26:21.214]  They would take a hallucinogenic enema,
[01:26:22.387 --> 01:26:35.153]  While drinking another poison that would cause painful hallucinations, to have pain-inducing hallucinations, because they believe the gods needed pain and blood, just like Satanists believe trauma gives them power, and that Satan gives them power.
[01:26:35.173 --> 01:26:44.538]  Well, they believe in the flying serpent, and the jaguar, and the horned god, and the god of death, this evil skull god, and they worship them.
[01:26:45.572 --> 01:26:52.677]  And they believe that God needed this, and it is a sick, degenerate, scum-filled culture.
[01:26:53.398 --> 01:27:06.407]  And I said that about three years ago, and the ADL put out, I guess, Border Extremist Report, or something, I forget the name, just type my name into the ADL search engine, and I'm in there.
[01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:10.070]  And of course they misquoted me, I called up and threatened to sue them, and they changed part of it.
[01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:16.101]  And they said, Alex Jones says all Mexicans are evil and are a degenerate culture.
[01:27:16.181 --> 01:27:16.541]  No, no, no.
[01:27:16.622 --> 01:27:24.567]  I said that the Spanish culture that is intermingled is a good family culture, predominantly, and that they're good family people and they're good hard-working folks.
[01:27:24.867 --> 01:27:32.892]  That culture supplanted the Aztec culture, the Mayan Toltec culture, the Mesoamerican prehistoric culture.
[01:27:33.735 --> 01:27:59.165]  Now, it, by the Ford Foundation and big universities that are sickos, that support Hitler and the rest of it, anything evil they support, they have gone and created a liberation theology around this, to the point of, the last Austin mayor, Gus Garcia, gets up and has proclamations saying that they are the master race that comes from space aliens and the golden crystal pyramid, and these are quotes, folks, and that they're taking over.
[01:28:00.105 --> 01:28:01.786]  And it's a total lunatic world.
[01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:07.212]  I mean, I don't know what's up with the Nation of Islam saying flying saucers control them and they're the master race.
[01:28:07.252 --> 01:28:12.634]  I mean, it just... The Nazis said they were the master race and that some kind of gods planted them here.
[01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:15.795]  I mean, this is the ideology of Satan, folks.
[01:28:16.335 --> 01:28:26.858]  The Nazis, the Mesoamericans, the Nation of Islam... And listen, if the Nation of Islam is listening as I bash Bush, you know, like that, I don't care.
[01:28:28.655 --> 01:28:34.779]  Your leader on tape saying mother wheel, flying saucer, evil black scientist made devil people, devil whites.
[01:28:34.819 --> 01:28:36.480]  I mean, just give me a break and shut up.
[01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.582]  You're the racist and you make me sick.
[01:28:40.022 --> 01:28:41.523]  You make me sick.
[01:28:42.524 --> 01:28:43.484]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.925 --> 01:28:45.566]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.446 --> 01:28:49.128]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:56.312]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:56.532 --> 01:28:59.934]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:29:00.094 --> 01:29:03.615]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:03.855 --> 01:29:07.057]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:07.077 --> 01:29:12.599]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[01:29:12.619 --> 01:29:17.782]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:29:18.302 --> 01:29:18.863]  We're good to go.
[01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:39.145]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:29:39.185 --> 01:29:40.166]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:29:52.057 --> 01:29:59.560]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:12.845]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[01:30:13.126 --> 01:30:16.407]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:16.767 --> 01:30:27.230]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:28.010]  That's right!
[01:30:28.191 --> 01:30:35.313]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:35.593 --> 01:30:41.735]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10.
[01:30:42.875 --> 01:30:44.339]  Calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.399 --> 01:30:44.860]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:56.188 --> 01:31:04.595]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach, hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:04.915 --> 01:31:12.822]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.962 --> 01:31:20.008]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:20.228 --> 01:31:21.449]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.589 --> 01:31:24.970]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:27.711]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:27.911 --> 01:31:34.754]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:34.854 --> 01:31:37.315]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:37.495 --> 01:31:40.439]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625.
[01:31:40.459 --> 01:31:40.499]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.461]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:08.143 --> 01:32:09.885]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:09.925 --> 01:32:11.466]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:32:11.546 --> 01:32:18.151]  We're very close to getting our ISDN lines back up and our
[01:32:31.309 --> 01:32:34.851]  T1's correctly configured to take your 1-800 toll-free call.
[01:32:34.871 --> 01:32:38.134]  We'll see if that happens by the end of this transmission today.
[01:32:38.154 --> 01:32:40.555]  Got to get things back in order after the big studio move.
[01:32:42.437 --> 01:32:47.240]  And, uh, yes, Thomas Keene, the 9-11 White Watcher, someone complicit in covering up the truth of 9-11.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:48.281]  Wonder how he sleeps at night.
[01:32:48.301 --> 01:32:49.021]  Probably quite well.
[01:32:49.041 --> 01:32:54.805]  Uh, he's going to be up giving a press conference here in a big, in what, 30, actually 40 minutes.
[01:32:55.625 --> 01:32:57.767]  Up there at the University that's based in, uh,
[01:32:58.559 --> 01:33:09.267]  Georgetown, and then he's going to give a speech to the student body, and we've got people there covering it, so by the end of the broadcast, we might even get some calls in right before 2 to see what happened with that press conference.
[01:33:09.307 --> 01:33:13.990]  So guys, if you're listening, I forgot to tell you before you left the office to go cover things that happened at the press conference.
[01:33:14.771 --> 01:33:19.194]  Ring-a-dingy me on your cell phone into the board here at the network.
[01:33:19.234 --> 01:33:22.356]  We are able to take your calls to the back line, as we've been able to all week.
[01:33:22.416 --> 01:33:23.457]  I'm able to take the general calls.
[01:33:23.917 --> 01:33:27.360]  You can call in and give us a report about Keene and the pre-cut press conference.
[01:33:29.233 --> 01:33:30.394]  But you know what?
[01:33:31.215 --> 01:33:38.104]  I want to get more into the Aztecs and the purely evil society and how that is now to be the new American society.
[01:33:39.065 --> 01:33:54.550]  And how it's being supported by the establishment, and then I want to get into some good news on the truth coming out about Aspartame, Ritalin, and the good news about some Vitamin C reports coming out, and I'll get into a bunch of other international news on Iran, and a lot more.
[01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:55.491]  Very, very important.
[01:33:55.531 --> 01:33:58.292]  Right now though, I haven't played in a few weeks, people have asked for it to be re-aired.
[01:33:58.552 --> 01:34:04.874]  So here's a local Austin band, Cruiserweight, that won awards at the Austin Music Awards a few weeks ago, and they are fans of the broadcast.
[01:34:05.334 --> 01:34:06.135]  I'm fans of them.
[01:34:06.435 --> 01:34:08.956]  So let's go ahead and roll this threat of a threat of a threat.
[01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.017]  You know, just like Iraq.
[01:34:10.257 --> 01:34:13.299]  We've got to invade them because there's a threat that there could be a threat that there could be a threat.
[01:34:13.779 --> 01:34:18.662]  We've got to take all your rights and have checkpoints and take your due process away because there's a threat of a threat of a threat.
[01:34:18.682 --> 01:34:26.367]  But the Communist Chinese military can take over the Long Beach Naval Base, the Panama Canal, and now run security at our only deepwater port in the Bahamas and the Caribbean.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:38.585]  And foreign Arab companies will take over 21 of our ports, and German companies and Spanish companies will take over all of our roads and our water districts and our power companies, and you know, just... But that's okay, there's a threat of a threat of a threat, you've got to be a slave.
[01:34:38.865 --> 01:34:40.466]  So here it is, a threat of a threat of a threat.
[01:35:28.243 --> 01:35:30.226]  Does it make you clean?
[01:35:31.668 --> 01:35:36.814]  Just because it's liquid, does it make it water?
[01:35:36.834 --> 01:35:45.905]  You push your weight around, but have you paid your dues?
[01:35:45.945 --> 01:35:47.167]  There's a threat!
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:28.822]  We're good to go.
[01:37:40.916 --> 01:37:44.798]  Driving straight into a storm.
[01:37:45.458 --> 01:37:48.119]  Operation has closed.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.661]  With impending disaster lurking.
[01:37:52.721 --> 01:37:55.782]  Can you give us the old line?
[01:37:56.042 --> 01:37:57.343]  You know the one.
[01:37:57.603 --> 01:37:59.544]  Let's take what we're made of.
[01:39:03.784 --> 01:39:04.905]  You got that.
[01:39:04.945 --> 01:39:06.127]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:39:06.167 --> 01:39:08.029]  Thank you so much for joining us again today.
[01:39:09.932 --> 01:39:10.753]  What's the verse?
[01:39:11.434 --> 01:39:12.615]  What part of the Bible is it?
[01:39:12.655 --> 01:39:15.900]  What would it profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul?
[01:39:17.938 --> 01:39:23.660]  For those of you who don't believe about life or death, okay, well, I mean, being evil in this life doesn't sound very fun to me.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:28.562]  It doesn't sound very good to be abusive and evil and wicked and to do all these horrible things.
[01:39:29.183 --> 01:39:30.223]  I've studied the globalists.
[01:39:30.243 --> 01:39:31.584]  They're very unhappy people.
[01:39:31.604 --> 01:39:34.005]  They only seem to feel alive when they're doing even greater evil.
[01:39:34.625 --> 01:39:41.048]  Psychopaths report that, that they're totally unhappy until they're doing the evil deed, and then it's almost like just a burning heat or a light.
[01:39:41.548 --> 01:39:43.388]  It's not even, it doesn't even feel good.
[01:39:43.408 --> 01:39:46.890]  It just, it just makes them actually feel like they're at least alive.
[01:39:48.228 --> 01:39:49.589]  Yeah, tapped into the dark side.
[01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:52.652]  And so these are just animals.
[01:39:52.672 --> 01:39:58.637]  These are malfunctioning, sick, twisted, fallen creatures that we face, that we grapple with.
[01:39:59.478 --> 01:40:01.500]  And they one-up each other.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:12.289]  It's funny to them to spread DU everywhere, and to do all this evil, and to have giant UN-run kidnapping rings, and run murder for hire, and be gangsters, and have people be afraid of them, and to
[01:40:13.797 --> 01:40:14.297]  They're bullies.
[01:40:14.317 --> 01:40:19.359]  They're bullies that just keep getting away with it, getting wilder and crazier and nuttier and more abusive.
[01:40:19.779 --> 01:40:21.740]  And psychopaths always want to get caught, too.
[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.780]  That's the criminology.
[01:40:23.721 --> 01:40:27.722]  They always do nuttier and nuttier and more open and more reckless things.
[01:40:28.062 --> 01:40:29.903]  And then we get hurt in the process.
[01:40:30.743 --> 01:40:33.924]  But now they've got fancy propaganda to convince us to go along with them.
[01:40:34.325 --> 01:40:35.985]  That propaganda is an illusion.
[01:40:36.485 --> 01:40:37.966]  The real world is painful.
[01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:47.275]  The real world is scary, and there's this facade, all these pretty things, all these happy things, and there is a lot of good in the world, and we have to protect that good.
[01:40:47.295 --> 01:40:51.717]  You know, the globalists are masters of making you think that the good comes from them.
[01:40:52.757 --> 01:40:55.378]  Making you think that they built all this, and they did all this.
[01:40:55.418 --> 01:40:56.219]  No, they did nothing!
[01:40:56.439 --> 01:41:03.722]  They're much of degenerate scumbags holding back our human development as we reach towards the stars, our penultimate destiny.
[01:41:05.137 --> 01:41:17.985]  They're holding back our destiny as creatures made in God's image to be good, enlightened, informed, creative, loving, dynamic individuals struggling ever onward and upward.
[01:41:18.045 --> 01:41:22.828]  No, they want to keep us back in the mud and the dirt just so they can control things.
[01:41:23.048 --> 01:41:29.933]  So they can have a big bloody pyramid with blood running down the front of it and dead bodies everywhere and a stench of rotten meat.
[01:41:30.856 --> 01:41:36.277]  That's what they love is maggot-filled deaths, smoking ruins, skulls, destruction.
[01:41:36.577 --> 01:41:37.937]  They're the dark side.
[01:41:37.977 --> 01:41:38.798]  They're death.
[01:41:39.118 --> 01:41:40.338]  They're a black hole.
[01:41:40.558 --> 01:41:42.838]  They're the creatures that come out of black holes.
[01:41:43.038 --> 01:41:44.779]  They're the creatures that come out of the pit.
[01:41:45.259 --> 01:41:51.960]  And they manifest on our plane of existence and they turn our beautiful planet and our beautiful destiny into a hell!
[01:41:55.741 --> 01:41:56.521]  And it's that simple.
[01:41:58.234 --> 01:42:01.695]  And that's the cost, that's what we face, that's what we deal with, that's the reality.
[01:42:02.636 --> 01:42:10.058]  I'll get into Iran in a minute, but first, I've been promising for several days to cover this.
[01:42:13.239 --> 01:42:17.681]  This is out of the Australian, big national paper over there, Child Drugs Linked to Heart Attack.
[01:42:20.862 --> 01:42:23.324]  Now notice how they start out with a low number, but then it gets higher later.
[01:42:23.644 --> 01:42:32.149]  Children as young as 5 have suffered strokes, heart attacks, hallucinations, and convulsions after taking drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:34.911]  Something made up by a psychologist who isn't even a doctor.
[01:42:35.487 --> 01:42:45.013]  Documents obtained by the Australian reveal that almost 400 serious adverse reactions have been reported in the Therapeutic Goods Administration, some involving children as young as three.
[01:42:45.053 --> 01:42:45.954]  Now let me stop right there.
[01:42:46.394 --> 01:42:51.037]  Doctors will tell you, and I've looked up Australian and Commonwealth numbers, they're the same as the U.S., roughly.
[01:42:52.378 --> 01:42:54.079]  It's the same administration, same program.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.540]  They're identical, just different names.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.401]  In some cases, the same names.
[01:42:58.485 --> 01:43:01.967]  Only about 10%, and that is a conservative number.
[01:43:02.167 --> 01:43:06.889]  A lot of times you see about 5% being reported, but let's just give them the high end.
[01:43:07.029 --> 01:43:11.751]  You know, maximum reporting that we've seen in any type of adverse reaction is 10%.
[01:43:12.351 --> 01:43:19.895]  Now you get into an industry where it's the psychologists and psychiatrists rationalizing and covering up what they're doing, and not wanting their own liability.
[01:43:20.335 --> 01:43:23.657]  I mean, I would guess that you're probably getting adverse reaction reports being filed on maybe 1%.
[01:43:25.069 --> 01:43:36.317]  But, but, the average is about 5, but on the, in some areas, some professions in the medical profession, some specialties, they'll report, they'll file on themselves 10% of the time.
[01:43:37.178 --> 01:43:38.919]  Or somebody will go to another doctor and they'll file.
[01:43:38.939 --> 01:43:41.441]  Okay, so this is stuff that is filed.
[01:43:42.458 --> 01:43:44.839]  And let me assure you, my dad's a dentist and oral surgeon.
[01:43:45.179 --> 01:43:50.362]  When he has an adverse reaction with a prescribed drug, most of the time, you don't have time, you're not supposed to.
[01:43:51.343 --> 01:43:52.043]  You don't have to every time.
[01:43:52.083 --> 01:43:54.044]  I guarantee you, my dad doesn't follow those every time.
[01:43:54.104 --> 01:43:55.585]  I mean, I haven't even asked him, but I know he doesn't.
[01:43:55.865 --> 01:43:56.825]  I know other doctors don't.
[01:43:56.865 --> 01:43:58.046]  I know medical, but you can't.
[01:43:59.047 --> 01:44:00.687]  You don't know every time what it is.
[01:44:01.528 --> 01:44:08.351]  It could be some other drug, but... So, 400 in Australia in the last few years, and so let's say it's 10%, so 10 times that.
[01:44:08.371 --> 01:44:08.712]  10 times 400.
[01:44:12.321 --> 01:44:13.262]  We're talking right up near 5,000.
[01:44:13.302 --> 01:44:14.563]  What is that, 4,000?
[01:44:15.944 --> 01:44:16.745]  Yeah, right at 4,000.
[01:44:18.486 --> 01:44:24.652]  So, children as young as 5 have suffered... Now, we knew this when they approved Redland 30 years ago.
[01:44:25.353 --> 01:44:26.494]  It was more than 30 years ago.
[01:44:27.254 --> 01:44:30.257]  They were doing it 55 years ago, for some reason, giving them speed.
[01:44:30.277 --> 01:44:36.702]  I mean, I've seen reports even further back than that, but it was officially approved decades ago, and they knew day one.
[01:44:36.743 --> 01:44:39.325]  I mean, listen, there was a young black football player,
[01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:42.090]  Best shape you could imagine.
[01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.910]  Forget his name.
[01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:43.291]  I knew him.
[01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:43.891]  He was in the 8th grade.
[01:44:43.911 --> 01:44:44.571]  I was in the 7th.
[01:44:45.572 --> 01:44:46.312]  What was his name?
[01:44:48.434 --> 01:44:49.794]  It's painful forgetting stuff.
[01:44:50.355 --> 01:44:51.595]  I tell you, I hit 32, folks.
[01:44:51.635 --> 01:44:53.096]  My memory is still excellent.
[01:44:53.416 --> 01:44:55.858]  But that absolute purity, I can see it.
[01:44:56.678 --> 01:44:59.300]  Well, they say you start having massive brain cells die off at 30.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.922]  And I can now experience not having the photographic memory.
[01:45:03.102 --> 01:45:04.203]  What was his name?
[01:45:04.223 --> 01:45:06.164]  It's driving me up the wall.
[01:45:07.945 --> 01:45:08.025]  Um...
[01:45:09.252 --> 01:45:12.593]  I'm sure you've noticed the last two years, I don't have total recall anymore.
[01:45:13.773 --> 01:45:18.974]  But to make a long story short, child drugs linked to heart attack.
[01:45:19.014 --> 01:45:21.755]  But this young black man, he's just out there in two days.
[01:45:21.775 --> 01:45:22.595]  Two days had just started.
[01:45:22.615 --> 01:45:24.115]  It was in the morning.
[01:45:24.135 --> 01:45:25.255]  It wasn't even hot.
[01:45:25.375 --> 01:45:27.316]  They were just doing some stuff and he had a huge heart attack.
[01:45:27.336 --> 01:45:27.996]  His heart blew up.
[01:45:29.316 --> 01:45:30.836]  And the coaches then talked to doctors.
[01:45:30.856 --> 01:45:33.377]  And I remember Coach Webb walking around cussing in the
[01:45:34.468 --> 01:45:36.849]  A few days later, going, those G.D.
[01:45:36.969 --> 01:45:40.710]  doctors, they put him on Ritalin because they said he wasn't doing good in his classes.
[01:45:41.911 --> 01:45:44.532]  And I heard from the medical doctor, that's what killed him!
[01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:52.775]  They're throwing stuff, and I mean, I remember Coach Webb, he was the wild brother of the high school coach who I later was under.
[01:45:53.195 --> 01:45:54.056]  Oh, they were something else.
[01:45:54.696 --> 01:45:58.517]  Oh, they were all former Marines, all Korean and Vietnam vets.
[01:45:58.537 --> 01:45:59.278]  They were something else.
[01:45:59.298 --> 01:45:59.918]  Those were good guys.
[01:46:00.811 --> 01:46:03.612]  But I remember him really getting mad a few days later after he died.
[01:46:03.632 --> 01:46:04.372]  They were crying.
[01:46:04.772 --> 01:46:05.653]  They really liked him.
[01:46:06.573 --> 01:46:07.573]  Cussing in their office.
[01:46:07.593 --> 01:46:09.694]  They didn't even know we were in there listening to it.
[01:46:11.274 --> 01:46:13.335]  And he was a really nice guy.
[01:46:13.395 --> 01:46:14.475]  What was his name?
[01:46:15.276 --> 01:46:20.197]  And then somebody else in my school was on Ritalin and had a heart attack and dropped dead.
[01:46:20.657 --> 01:46:22.178]  The next year when I was in 8th grade.
[01:46:22.218 --> 01:46:23.938]  I mean, I wasn't in that big of a school.
[01:46:23.998 --> 01:46:24.559]  Rockwall.
[01:46:25.279 --> 01:46:25.559]  I don't know.
[01:46:25.579 --> 01:46:27.340]  How many students were there in the 6th grade?
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.460]  A couple hundred?
[01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:31.425]  I guess it was a 3A then.
[01:46:31.465 --> 01:46:32.226]  It later went to 4A.
[01:46:32.246 --> 01:46:35.988]  It was a pretty good size, but they're dropping that all over the place.
[01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:39.411]  And that was Ridland.
[01:46:39.431 --> 01:46:39.931]  He was on Ridland.
[01:46:39.951 --> 01:46:41.272]  Now they've got him on stuff even worse.
[01:46:42.693 --> 01:46:48.857]  And every day I see reports out of, for some reason it's always out of Florida, but kids having heart attacks on Ridland.
[01:46:48.877 --> 01:46:50.078]  Their heart's blowing up.
[01:46:50.938 --> 01:46:52.840]  And they admit what it does.
[01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:53.920]  It retards growth.
[01:46:55.061 --> 01:46:56.102]  It retards growth.
[01:46:56.742 --> 01:46:57.503]  He was a running back.
[01:46:57.523 --> 01:46:58.123]  What was his name?
[01:46:59.989 --> 01:47:01.230]  I can see him right now.
[01:47:03.752 --> 01:47:04.572]  They have heart attacks.
[01:47:04.592 --> 01:47:05.313]  They have strokes.
[01:47:05.513 --> 01:47:09.376]  It causes heart shrinkage, heart expansion.
[01:47:10.176 --> 01:47:11.857]  It causes vascular collapse.
[01:47:12.638 --> 01:47:14.899]  It causes insomnia.
[01:47:14.919 --> 01:47:16.340]  I mean, it causes everything.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:17.221]  Speed causes.
[01:47:17.241 --> 01:47:18.122]  Speed kills, folks.
[01:47:18.942 --> 01:47:19.643]  It's just clean.
[01:47:19.663 --> 01:47:20.763]  It's the same thing as methamphetamine.
[01:47:20.823 --> 01:47:21.344]  It's just clean.
[01:47:22.565 --> 01:47:24.546]  Same thing they give the troops out there now.
[01:47:24.566 --> 01:47:25.967]  They're trying to get them all hopped up on it.
[01:47:27.026 --> 01:47:30.008]  The fighter pilots and now the ground troops and the tanker crews and the rest of them.
[01:47:30.028 --> 01:47:33.289]  We're going to go raid, you know, 20 houses today.
[01:47:33.689 --> 01:47:34.750]  SWAT team raids.
[01:47:35.290 --> 01:47:35.850]  I can't do it.
[01:47:35.890 --> 01:47:36.511]  I can't get up.
[01:47:36.531 --> 01:47:38.952]  We've been doing raids for the last year straight.
[01:47:38.992 --> 01:47:39.812]  I got to have time off.
[01:47:39.852 --> 01:47:40.673]  I got sprains.
[01:47:41.853 --> 01:47:43.254]  I order you to take these pills.
[01:47:44.835 --> 01:47:48.476]  But anyways, now they're even giving them hallucinogenics and amnesiacs.
[01:47:48.516 --> 01:47:49.817]  That was in Wired Magazine.
[01:47:51.434 --> 01:47:55.398]  They give them pleasure drugs after they do a bunch of operations to reward them.
[01:47:55.458 --> 01:47:59.782]  I mean, you talk about science fiction and it's happening, but to make a long story short, I'm digressing here.
[01:48:01.823 --> 01:48:05.226]  They, uh... I mean, I know people who've died from this.
[01:48:05.947 --> 01:48:07.829]  I know a family where they have three sons.
[01:48:08.449 --> 01:48:11.572]  And the one son who's on Ritalin, the mother and the father are both tall.
[01:48:11.592 --> 01:48:12.633]  The father's like six foot three.
[01:48:15.578 --> 01:48:18.640]  One of the kids who's on Ritalin, and I've known him for, I guess, ten years now.
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:19.740]  Friends of the family.
[01:48:20.281 --> 01:48:22.142]  He is basically a midget.
[01:48:23.563 --> 01:48:29.726]  And then the other two, we get back to this stuff, the other two are almost six feet now, I guess.
[01:48:30.246 --> 01:48:31.667]  They're older teens.
[01:48:34.128 --> 01:48:36.790]  I mean, to see them do this, and to know it does this,
[01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:38.931]  Let me just read this.
[01:48:39.031 --> 01:48:43.934]  Cases include the sudden death of a seven-year-old, a five-year-old who suffered a stroke after taking Ritalin.
[01:48:43.954 --> 01:48:51.400]  Children also experience heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and taking dexaphenetamine.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:52.621]  And you know what?
[01:48:52.661 --> 01:48:53.481]  I'm just going to be honest.
[01:48:53.502 --> 01:48:54.923]  I'm not going to sit here and pull any punches.
[01:48:55.123 --> 01:48:57.865]  I never got into hard drugs because I tried them once or twice.
[01:48:58.345 --> 01:48:59.846]  Only once or twice a piece.
[01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:00.807]  Never tried heroin.
[01:49:01.898 --> 01:49:04.760]  And, you know, you're at a party and somebody says, hey, take this pill, you'll like it.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:10.424]  And you take some speed pill, and your heart starts beating weird, and you get dizzy, and I'm like, my gosh!
[01:49:10.924 --> 01:49:12.505]  Why would anybody take that?
[01:49:13.766 --> 01:49:22.152]  I mean, I before have had like eight glasses of iced tea at a meeting at Luby's Cafeteria and gone to the gym three hours later and had my heart beating funny.
[01:49:22.672 --> 01:49:25.654]  They admit, what, two cups of coffee a day radically increases the heart attack.
[01:49:26.835 --> 01:49:27.575]  I mean, my gosh!
[01:49:27.615 --> 01:49:29.336]  Caffeine will make my heart beat funny!
[01:49:29.376 --> 01:49:31.478]  I mean, what in the world are they giving this to kids?
[01:49:32.478 --> 01:49:33.398]  And it goes on and on.
[01:49:33.418 --> 01:49:35.479]  The good news is it's coming up.
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:37.640]  And then here's some of the other articles.
[01:49:39.361 --> 01:49:42.322]  Biggest European aspartame producer to quit production.
[01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:43.603]  There's another one.
[01:49:43.623 --> 01:49:44.703]  Vitamin C for cancer.
[01:49:45.103 --> 01:49:45.583]  Reconsidered.
[01:49:46.344 --> 01:49:48.505]  So some interesting news coming up after the break.
[01:49:49.105 --> 01:49:49.665]  And a lot more.
[01:49:49.705 --> 01:49:50.145]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.419 --> 01:49:56.281]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:56.522 --> 01:49:58.103]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:58.443 --> 01:50:03.127]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:03.467 --> 01:50:10.193]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:10.533 --> 01:50:12.515]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:12.715 --> 01:50:15.557]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:15.637 --> 01:50:20.320]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:20.521 --> 01:50:24.904]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:25.164 --> 01:50:32.369]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:50:54.448 --> 01:51:05.176]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:51:05.556 --> 01:51:10.080]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:21.489]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:51:22.049 --> 01:51:28.919]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:51:29.299 --> 01:51:31.442]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:51:31.943 --> 01:51:36.910]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.

[01:52:56.974 --> 01:53:02.798]  Continuing with this Australian article, out of the Australian, it admits here that quote more than 5,800 prescriptions were written for Ritalin in January of this year, compared to 523 in August of last year.
[01:53:02.838 --> 01:53:03.398]  This is in Australia.
[01:53:03.418 --> 01:53:04.339]  Prescriptions for dexamethasone
[01:53:27.626 --> 01:53:28.547]  It's an amphetamine.
[01:53:28.567 --> 01:53:29.347]  I can't pronounce it.
[01:53:29.568 --> 01:53:31.789]  Dexamethamine.
[01:53:32.049 --> 01:53:32.470]  There you go.
[01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:38.894]  Dexamethamine jumped from 96,000 a year to 232,000 in the 10 years from 2004 to 2005.
[01:53:38.994 --> 01:53:40.255]  Now, look at those numbers.
[01:53:40.275 --> 01:53:42.477]  In America, over 10 million youth are on these amphetamine type drugs.
[01:53:42.497 --> 01:53:43.598]  These amphetamine classes.
[01:53:56.676 --> 01:54:00.999]  of drugs, the impediment class of drugs, the speed class, the stimulant class.
[01:54:03.001 --> 01:54:05.003]  Over 10 million, over 15 million
[01:54:06.733 --> 01:54:13.675]  On the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, they're also speed, they have a speed effect, but with a hallucinogenic effect.
[01:54:13.715 --> 01:54:15.536]  By the way, that's on the insert of the drugs.
[01:54:15.576 --> 01:54:25.278]  You can, if you actually went and bought a bottle of it and asked your doctor to give you the insert that came with it, you would have the little double page printout and fine print.
[01:54:25.298 --> 01:54:26.899]  You have to use a magnifying glass to read.
[01:54:27.499 --> 01:54:27.939]  I've done it.
[01:54:27.979 --> 01:54:29.780]  It is classed as a hallucinogenic.
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:31.940]  So even more deadly.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:33.401]  It does all the same stuff.
[01:54:33.421 --> 01:54:34.701]  Of course, these toxic things do that.
[01:54:35.706 --> 01:54:39.347]  And imagine there, they've doubled in one year the prescriptions.
[01:54:40.807 --> 01:54:41.807]  Well, more than doubled.
[01:54:42.748 --> 01:54:44.708]  Just from the same month last year, it was 523.
[01:54:44.748 --> 01:54:45.128]  Now it's 5,800.
[01:54:45.168 --> 01:54:46.268]  That's not a doubling.
[01:54:46.288 --> 01:54:46.668]  What is that?
[01:54:46.728 --> 01:54:48.029]  Is that like... That's 12 times roughly.
[01:54:48.049 --> 01:54:48.889]  No... Yeah, it's 12 times.
[01:54:48.909 --> 01:54:50.069]  12 times the level.
[01:54:50.129 --> 01:54:50.309]  12 times.
[01:55:05.296 --> 01:55:08.979]  Now there they're just getting started, see, and their daughters are going, man, all these kids are dying.
[01:55:09.299 --> 01:55:18.507]  Imagine, they've got 400 serious adverse reactions, and then that's out of just a few thousand people that are on it.
[01:55:21.269 --> 01:55:27.314]  Can you imagine how many people are dying here in this country with 10 million and growing?
[01:55:27.614 --> 01:55:28.495]  It's exponential.
[01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:31.618]  It's exponential here.
[01:55:31.638 --> 01:55:34.300]  I mean, they've got two-year-olds on Ritalin and Prozac now.
[01:55:36.947 --> 01:55:39.189]  And this stuff fries your brain, folks.
[01:55:39.269 --> 01:55:40.530]  It fries your body.
[01:55:40.590 --> 01:55:41.710]  It fries you.
[01:55:42.291 --> 01:55:44.532]  It screws up your cardiovascular system.
[01:55:45.773 --> 01:55:46.974]  I mean, this stuff's deadly.
[01:55:48.154 --> 01:55:50.076]  This stuff is as white trash as it gets.
[01:55:50.116 --> 01:55:52.037]  I mean, it's a white trash drug to begin with.
[01:55:52.617 --> 01:55:54.499]  And we're going to put our kids on it.
[01:55:54.539 --> 01:55:58.201]  Yeah, they do settle down after a few months on it, because their brains are fried.
[01:55:58.221 --> 01:55:59.702]  You ever met a real speed head?
[01:55:59.722 --> 01:56:01.143]  They're not all sped up.
[01:56:01.963 --> 01:56:15.626]  They're just real calm and real weird and got a thousand-yard scare because your brain rhythm you go through REM sleep the average person has what 7.6 hour sleep cycle and between the fifth and sixth hour you go into your deepest REM sleep.
[01:56:15.646 --> 01:56:24.408]  It's kind of like a download period for the subconscious and a chemical reaction happens in the brain you need to reset your brain for the next day.
[01:56:24.688 --> 01:56:27.189]  You don't get that and you turn into a lunatic!
[01:56:28.311 --> 01:56:29.611]  They always hear about the speed head.
[01:56:29.631 --> 01:56:36.613]  You know, it's always the speed head that shoots five cops, or goes into a bar and shoots a bunch of people, or flips out and starts cutting themselves up with razor blades.
[01:56:36.633 --> 01:56:39.374]  They see, you know, they see stuff flying around in the room.
[01:56:39.394 --> 01:56:40.394]  They have hallucinations.
[01:56:42.654 --> 01:56:45.155]  I've been around in college and high school a few speed heads.
[01:56:45.235 --> 01:56:45.635]  I hate them.
[01:56:45.755 --> 01:56:46.655]  I just cannot stand them.
[01:56:47.396 --> 01:56:48.776]  Bunch of just idiots.
[01:56:49.856 --> 01:56:51.397]  They're out stealing for the drugs.
[01:56:51.657 --> 01:56:52.337]  Well, forget that.
[01:56:52.377 --> 01:56:54.557]  We'll just put, we'll just put ten million kids on it.
[01:56:55.258 --> 01:56:57.038]  In America, and so what if their hearts blow?
[01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:00.111]  So what if they lay down and die?
[01:57:02.113 --> 01:57:14.742]  I remember I didn't see what some of the other kids did when that little black boy, they brought him in from outside and he laid down on the field house bench and went into his cardiac arrest and it's probably blood even came out of his mouth.
[01:57:14.762 --> 01:57:17.424]  I mean that's how his heart just blew open.
[01:57:17.444 --> 01:57:21.107]  Can you imagine on that speed out there running?
[01:57:22.028 --> 01:57:22.388]  Out there?
[01:57:22.408 --> 01:57:24.410]  That heart just blew wide open?
[01:57:25.166 --> 01:57:27.988]  Imagine how it felt to have blood pouring into his ribcage.
[01:57:28.309 --> 01:57:31.391]  Poor thing, murdered by the government as usual.

[01:57:48.186 --> 01:57:48.846]  Big Brother.
[01:57:49.507 --> 01:57:50.567]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:51.267 --> 01:57:52.388]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.028 --> 01:57:53.849]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.609 --> 01:57:55.569]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.170 --> 01:57:59.831]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.351 --> 01:58:04.493]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.317 --> 01:58:14.978]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:16.307 --> 01:58:23.669]  Now, into the third and final hour of this live Friday edition, the 31st day of March.
[01:58:23.689 --> 01:58:26.950]  2000 and... I guess it's 2006 now, isn't it?
[01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:28.010]  Ha ha ha!
[01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:32.131]  Alright, last hour I got into some painful subjects.
[01:58:32.292 --> 01:58:35.012]  Child, uh, drugs linked to heart attacks.
[01:58:35.052 --> 01:58:35.772]  Mainstream news.
[01:58:37.973 --> 01:58:42.114]  And if the child's lucky enough not to die of a heart attack or a stroke, it's gonna retard growth.
[01:58:42.174 --> 01:58:44.515]  It's gonna cause heart problems, like speed does.
[01:58:46.562 --> 01:58:47.262]  Very, very sad.
[01:58:47.282 --> 01:58:51.144]  I want to get into Iran next after I cover this.
[01:58:51.224 --> 01:58:55.005]  Biggest Euro aspartame producer to quit production.
[01:58:55.025 --> 01:58:56.285]  This is by Dr. Betty Martini.
[01:58:58.946 --> 01:59:03.067]  With all the excuses of Holland Sweetener.
[01:59:03.147 --> 01:59:04.808]  Obviously the handwriting is on the wall.
[01:59:06.758 --> 01:59:26.874]  And, uh, she goes on to say, uh, with the study in Italy showing aspartame to be a multi-potential carcinogen, peer-reviewed by seven world experts, the studies by the original manufacturer, Surrell, who Rumsfeld was the head of it, got it approved, anything evil he's involved, which also showed cancer, have been confirmed.
[01:59:27.935 --> 01:59:35.741]  For years, the FDA and the manufacturers have tried to prevent independent studies, and Gregory Gordon, who did the original UPI investigation, once wrote an article on this.
[01:59:37.290 --> 01:59:41.913]  Well, now they have a major Liverpool study showing the interaction.
[01:59:42.634 --> 01:59:43.574]  They have one in Greece.
[01:59:44.855 --> 01:59:47.837]  They have a bunch of other governments doing the test.
[01:59:49.058 --> 01:59:57.143]  And now the FDA is obliged to recall aspartame and invoke the Delaney Amendment, which says if a product produces cancer in animals, it cannot be in food.
[01:59:57.844 --> 02:00:03.728]  Their own FDA toxicologist, Dr. Adrian Gross, told Congress that that should have been done in the beginning.
[02:00:05.536 --> 02:00:20.402]  And it goes on here to report that the biggest European producer is going to stop selling and producing aspartame because of the liability involved in it.
[02:00:20.462 --> 02:00:22.303]  So that's good news there.
[02:00:23.163 --> 02:00:28.505]  The problem is it's a lot cheaper than sugar so they're putting it in foods and calling it artificial sweetener.
[02:00:29.766 --> 02:00:32.067]  Or in some cases even natural sweetener.
[02:00:33.579 --> 02:00:35.420]  Yeah, I guess cyanide's natural too.
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:36.480]  So's arsenic.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:38.161]  So's jumping off a cliff.
[02:00:38.181 --> 02:00:39.021]  Doesn't mean it's good for you.
[02:00:39.542 --> 02:00:42.203]  I always love these people going, but it's natural!
[02:00:43.563 --> 02:00:44.183]  Ha ha ha!
[02:00:45.144 --> 02:00:49.026]  Always, all these hippies and people that take these organic drugs that are so poisonous.
[02:00:49.846 --> 02:00:53.287]  And they go, oh, but psilocybin mushrooms are natural.
[02:00:53.888 --> 02:00:55.648]  Yeah, and they naturally got strychnine in them.
[02:00:55.668 --> 02:00:57.189]  What do you think makes you go off your rocker?
[02:00:59.406 --> 02:01:02.987]  Nightshade, silver nightshade natural out in these cow pastures.
[02:01:03.007 --> 02:01:05.047]  You go eat some of it, your heart's going to explode.
[02:01:05.687 --> 02:01:06.867]  It's exactly what it does.
[02:01:07.548 --> 02:01:08.388]  You eat too much of it.
[02:01:08.408 --> 02:01:10.988]  That's what the witches used to take to hallucinate.
[02:01:11.348 --> 02:01:13.589]  They thought they were flying around in their brooms to hallucinate.
[02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:14.669]  That's where that comes from.
[02:01:15.069 --> 02:01:17.229]  Dancing around in the fire with a broom between their legs.
[02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:23.851]  They did that for another reason too, but uh... Pharmakea, drugs, it's power.
[02:01:24.411 --> 02:01:24.931]  It's alchemy.
[02:01:25.725 --> 02:01:31.766]  That's how the witch doctors of the Aztec system enslaved their people and had them all hallucinating going along with that hellish system.
[02:01:32.946 --> 02:01:36.507]  The Nazis were some of the first in modern times to give speed to their troops.
[02:01:36.647 --> 02:01:38.147]  We just gotta get off these drugs.
[02:01:38.167 --> 02:01:39.508]  I mean, I think coffee's bad for me.
[02:01:39.548 --> 02:01:40.488]  I drink a cup in the morning.
[02:01:41.348 --> 02:01:42.668]  Later in the afternoon I'll have a cup of tea.
[02:01:44.128 --> 02:01:44.629]  Hot tea.
[02:01:44.909 --> 02:01:45.289]  I like it.
[02:01:45.749 --> 02:01:49.610]  It's not as heavy as the coffee, but I'm convinced sometimes I don't drink it and I feel good.
[02:01:49.890 --> 02:01:52.010]  And about a day later I get a big headache going through withdrawals.
[02:01:52.765 --> 02:01:56.566]  But we just need to get off the drugs, and get on the good stuff, like this!
[02:01:57.306 --> 02:02:02.028]  By the way, I have a report, another big mainstream report, that cell phones are causing massive brain tumors.
[02:02:02.208 --> 02:02:08.209]  They admit it heats the brain one degree, and sends in microwave energy to the head, through the brain, through the skull.
[02:02:09.249 --> 02:02:11.730]  And I'm an idiot too, I just still keep putting it up against my head.
[02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:15.351]  So, hey, you know, I guess you can't do it all.
[02:02:16.031 --> 02:02:18.332]  When we get back, vitamin C for cancer reconsidered?
[02:02:20.325 --> 02:02:23.168]  And much more coming up on the other side.
[02:02:23.969 --> 02:02:25.511]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:02:26.212 --> 02:02:29.575]  Chilling ourselves to live is, I guess, the name of the game.
[02:02:30.596 --> 02:02:31.617]  Oh, I gotta use my phone.
[02:02:31.637 --> 02:02:32.639]  I'm in the habit of doing it.
[02:02:33.299 --> 02:02:35.161]  And now you told me, Alex, it's really deadly.
[02:02:35.882 --> 02:02:37.404]  But those little ear pieces are a hassle.
[02:02:38.325 --> 02:02:39.986]  So I want a big fat brain tumor.
[02:02:40.067 --> 02:02:41.048]  Well, hey, I do it too.
[02:02:41.068 --> 02:02:41.448]  Ha ha ha.
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:50.722]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:51.002 --> 02:02:52.382]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:52.562 --> 02:02:54.763]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:54.783 --> 02:02:57.023]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:57.284 --> 02:03:02.225]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:02.565 --> 02:03:06.586]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:06.846 --> 02:03:08.628]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:08.688 --> 02:03:19.356]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:19.496 --> 02:03:21.398]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:21.618 --> 02:03:25.481]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the info war.

[02:03:43.214 --> 02:03:46.656]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:46.956 --> 02:03:50.438]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:50.538 --> 02:03:54.481]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:54.701 --> 02:04:00.864]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:01.284 --> 02:04:09.189]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:14.935]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:15.095 --> 02:04:18.859]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.239 --> 02:04:21.081]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[02:04:21.141 --> 02:04:23.303]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:23.563 --> 02:04:28.808]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[02:04:28.849 --> 02:04:32.652]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-424-9000.
[02:04:42.555 --> 02:04:49.457]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:04:49.577 --> 02:05:02.461]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:05:02.961 --> 02:05:04.502]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:05:04.643 --> 02:05:08.126]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:05:08.386 --> 02:05:12.170]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:17.415]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:05:17.675 --> 02:05:19.377]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:05:19.637 --> 02:05:23.619]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:05:23.859 --> 02:05:25.720]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:05:30.562 --> 02:05:32.242]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[02:05:32.282 --> 02:05:32.823]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[02:05:44.097 --> 02:05:49.718]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:12.322]  So, last hour we got into, amongst other things, how a large portion, this is official Australian government admitting, a large portion
[02:06:13.431 --> 02:06:22.854]  Of the young children, as young as three there, and they do it too here, on the amphetamine stimulant, Ritalin, are having giant heart attacks.
[02:06:23.234 --> 02:06:24.514]  In fact, their hearts explode.
[02:06:24.614 --> 02:06:25.114]  Valves.
[02:06:26.015 --> 02:06:26.435]  Valves.
[02:06:26.475 --> 02:06:32.236]  Because the heart's growing still when you're five years old, ten years old.
[02:06:32.296 --> 02:06:35.497]  I guess the heart grows up until the organs keep growing until you're about fifteen.
[02:06:35.517 --> 02:06:37.918]  I'm not a doctor, but I've read that.
[02:06:38.578 --> 02:06:41.239]  Of course, the males continue growing until about twenty.
[02:06:42.356 --> 02:06:44.477]  And females, I believe, grow until about 18.
[02:06:45.498 --> 02:07:03.607]  And so there's a lot of connective tissue, a lot of things happening, and they found in these studies that you put them on the speed, and then the heart enlarges, and then the cartilage is only designed to be a certain size, and the valves, and just the aorta coming out of the top likes to blow on you.
[02:07:04.407 --> 02:07:07.629]  It's an extremely painful way to go, but hey, let's just murder some more children.
[02:07:08.917 --> 02:07:11.618]  We know what this does, but let's just do it.
[02:07:11.998 --> 02:07:15.320]  And these dumb parents will keep putting their kids on it until we tell them to.
[02:07:17.761 --> 02:07:26.905]  You see, I mean, if some drug that they don't like, or some pharma company that isn't on the inside, their drug hurts one person, they stop selling it.
[02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:34.008]  But if it's killing thousands and thousands and thousands, every year in Medellin, just so what?
[02:07:36.590 --> 02:07:58.853]  But the good news is aspartame is getting banned all over the world and manufacturers are stopping the manufacture of it because it causes all these brain tumors and problems and every monkey study they do and every rat study they do, every guinea pig study they do, you start feeding them the equivalent diet that a heavy aspartame consumer eats, you're going to get Swiss cheese brains.
[02:07:59.645 --> 02:08:00.666]  Another big report here.
[02:08:00.686 --> 02:08:01.627]  It's somewhere in the stack.
[02:08:01.647 --> 02:08:02.507]  Where is that report?
[02:08:02.527 --> 02:08:03.728]  I'm not going to mention it.
[02:08:03.748 --> 02:08:05.770]  I better just have it here in front of me.
[02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:08.132]  No, Bush reassures Mexico on migrants.
[02:08:08.152 --> 02:08:09.273]  Don't worry, I'll legalize them.
[02:08:09.773 --> 02:08:11.094]  Blair will be gone by Christmas.
[02:08:11.174 --> 02:08:12.015]  No, that's not it.
[02:08:13.616 --> 02:08:15.858]  Where is my... I know I printed it this morning.
[02:08:16.598 --> 02:08:19.381]  I have a computer right here, but if I print it, I can instantly go to it.
[02:08:19.401 --> 02:08:23.124]  If I try to surf around the web, well, I guess it kind of invalidates that.
[02:08:23.144 --> 02:08:23.944]  I can instantly go to it.
[02:08:23.984 --> 02:08:25.726]  If I can't find it, it's...
[02:08:26.932 --> 02:08:27.973]  When I find it in my stack.
[02:08:28.273 --> 02:08:33.036]  Another big study about you get a brain tumor right where you put the phone up against your head.
[02:08:33.096 --> 02:08:46.444]  It shoots through the little quarter-inch skull and skin and then over time kills the brain cells there and the body tries to replicate to repair those areas and you get cancer.
[02:08:46.464 --> 02:08:48.645]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[02:08:48.786 --> 02:08:49.966]  These are the things that are killing us.
[02:08:51.647 --> 02:08:53.649]  Now here's some good news for you.
[02:08:54.929 --> 02:08:55.430]  This is out of
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:04.042]  The British newspaper, Innova, vitamin C for cancer reconsidered.
[02:09:04.122 --> 02:09:24.850]  Because remember, a Nobel Prize winner went public, big studies, and found that massive doses of organic vitamin C, that's out of the source fruits and vegetables and berries particularly, backs off cancer, makes your cells replicate properly without errors in the DNA transfer.
[02:09:25.985 --> 02:09:29.172]  Both in the mitochondrial DNA and then in the base DNA.
[02:09:29.192 --> 02:09:30.515]  There's two different types in the cell.
[02:09:33.562 --> 02:09:35.446]  Industry and others have said it's not true.
[02:09:36.793 --> 02:09:38.235]  Drink your sugar drinks.
[02:09:38.255 --> 02:09:41.758]  You don't have vitamin C. You don't need fresh vegetables.
[02:09:42.419 --> 02:09:44.381]  Vitamin C for cancer reconsidered.
[02:09:44.621 --> 02:09:53.209]  Following studies conducted in the 70s, two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling touted the benefits of high-dose vitamin C for cancer patients.
[02:09:53.269 --> 02:09:56.793]  Since that time, though, the treatment has remained highly controversial.
[02:09:57.293 --> 02:10:05.977]  Critics say the study was full of problems, and many follow-up studies, including those performed at the Mayo Clinic, who wants to give you chemo and radiation, found the treatment ineffective.
[02:10:06.017 --> 02:10:09.859]  Of course, because you don't suck every dime out of somebody if you do it that way.
[02:10:09.879 --> 02:10:18.863]  The Rockefellers actually wrote papers in the 30s saying they were going to build all the hospitals, which they still own most of them, and then suck all your money right before death out of you with expensive cancer treatments.
[02:10:18.883 --> 02:10:19.323]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:20.124]  Let's not get into that right now.
[02:10:20.704 --> 02:10:31.568]  Now results of three recent cases studies published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal show the treatment may in fact help some cancer patients live longer lives cancer-free.
[02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:34.409]  Yeah, I mean no one ever said it was a cure.
[02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:42.492]  People wrote books off of Linus Palming's research saying that and made tens of millions of dollars as a bunch of quacks saying it's going to cure you.
[02:10:42.892 --> 02:10:46.794]  Anybody that says they got a hundred percent cure for cancer is a liar.
[02:10:47.608 --> 02:10:52.131]  We've interviewed the doctors, the experts on cancer, the scientists, the researchers.
[02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:57.074]  There are hundreds and hundreds of different types of cancers.
[02:10:57.454 --> 02:10:59.215]  Most cancers are genetic related.
[02:10:59.655 --> 02:11:02.137]  And then they're triggered by cancer viruses.
[02:11:02.277 --> 02:11:11.242]  And again, most Americans don't know this, but all the vanguard research the last three decades shows most cancer is virus related.
[02:11:12.116 --> 02:11:20.025]  There are viruses that hit the cells, reprogram, that's what viruses do, the cells burst, disgorging, masses of more viruses.
[02:11:20.126 --> 02:11:28.916]  One cell, depending on the virus type, can spew hundreds of thousands of more viruses, and your body just can't fight it off.
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:30.320]  I think?
[02:11:48.294 --> 02:11:49.975]  Things that look like animals.
[02:11:50.916 --> 02:11:53.498]  Again, things that look like animal-type bacteria.
[02:11:54.098 --> 02:11:55.559]  Things that look like cancer.
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:05.547]  You know, you start splicing funguses with bacteria because it'll eat oil in the North Atlantic and then it gets into drinking water supplies in Lake Superior and then we drink it.
[02:12:05.567 --> 02:12:06.528]  There's studies on that.
[02:12:06.888 --> 02:12:14.694]  Then the body totally freaks out when it sees new species that never existed of bacteria that have it slowly replicated and evolved.
[02:12:14.974 --> 02:12:16.655]  And there is evolution in bacteria, folks.
[02:12:16.995 --> 02:12:17.316]  Clearly.
[02:12:17.636 --> 02:12:18.618]  Now, I believe it's God's design.
[02:12:18.638 --> 02:12:19.860]  I don't want to have an argument about that.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.502]  You know, bacteria do that.
[02:12:22.704 --> 02:12:24.407]  And so then that totally confuses the body.
[02:12:24.427 --> 02:12:26.430]  So the body gets overwhelmed and basically gives up.
[02:12:26.891 --> 02:12:28.153]  And that's one way you get cancer.
[02:12:29.711 --> 02:12:36.332]  Or you get a lot of radiation or toxins in you that just burn the DNA with toxic reactions.
[02:12:36.372 --> 02:12:43.594]  They're small particulates, particularly lead, mercury, DU, and other things that are so small they go right through.
[02:12:43.634 --> 02:12:44.834]  The cell's electrochemical.
[02:12:44.874 --> 02:12:48.515]  It's like an electrochemical computer, electron microscope.
[02:12:48.535 --> 02:12:52.535]  You should want to look at the DNA through an electron microscope.
[02:12:52.575 --> 02:12:53.115]  I've done it online.
[02:12:53.396 --> 02:12:55.536]  It's just amazing, huge, you know,
[02:12:56.554 --> 02:13:02.058]  Huge photos online from electron microscopes that take five minutes to download with a high-quality cable modem.
[02:13:02.078 --> 02:13:05.301]  The pictures are so big, you can actually look at it and it looks like circuitry.
[02:13:05.921 --> 02:13:11.185]  I mean, it's beautiful what God has created, but the problem is these particles shoot right through the cell wall.
[02:13:12.206 --> 02:13:19.751]  I mean, to them it's like, you know, a hundred miles between each space in the cell wall and, you know, they're the size of a football.
[02:13:20.112 --> 02:13:22.994]  They just shoot right through and then hit that DNA and
[02:13:24.719 --> 02:13:26.261]  It all screws up, breaks up.
[02:13:26.521 --> 02:13:31.586]  Then when that cell replicates, a lot of times the cells just stop replicating and die.
[02:13:31.826 --> 02:13:36.090]  But then sometimes they malfunction and start replicating fast.
[02:13:36.631 --> 02:13:39.193]  And they boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[02:13:39.213 --> 02:13:41.756]  Then they start spreading to the body, programming everybody else.
[02:13:41.776 --> 02:13:43.197]  That's why cancer metastasizes.
[02:13:43.257 --> 02:13:43.918]  It's a cancer.
[02:13:44.738 --> 02:13:47.899]  That is literally carried through viral packets.
[02:13:47.999 --> 02:13:49.620]  This is what the latest science is showing.
[02:13:49.900 --> 02:13:56.222]  And then suddenly you've got cancer in a matter of a month in your brain, your bones, your livers, your kidneys, your skin, and you die.
[02:13:56.242 --> 02:13:58.943]  You basically just turn into liquid.
[02:14:00.723 --> 02:14:01.764]  This is what happens.
[02:14:02.244 --> 02:14:03.624]  And this is the wages of sin.
[02:14:03.664 --> 02:14:05.065]  The wages of sin are death.
[02:14:05.085 --> 02:14:06.745]  The globalists are a bunch of death-loving.
[02:14:06.765 --> 02:14:08.066]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:14:08.086 --> 02:14:08.986]  I mean, just look at it.
[02:14:09.286 --> 02:14:10.307]  The proof is in the pudding.
[02:14:10.367 --> 02:14:11.367]  Look at the fruits they bear.
[02:14:12.981 --> 02:14:17.223]  And so what vitamin C does is that vitamin C is collagen.
[02:14:17.804 --> 02:14:30.790]  Collagen is produced by vitamin C. Your skin is made up of vitamin C. Your skin, the very building blocks of your skin, is vitamin C and the things that it breaks down to in the body.
[02:14:32.211 --> 02:14:41.916]  And so if your cells are being bombarded and zapped, vitamin C, and of course the health of people don't push this either because they can't have some special health product that's $100 a bottle they can sell you.
[02:14:42.972 --> 02:14:43.332]  You see?
[02:14:44.012 --> 02:14:45.953]  And you don't even want a bottle of vitamin C, folks.
[02:14:45.993 --> 02:14:49.874]  You want to eat large portions of organic fruit.
[02:14:49.954 --> 02:14:50.414]  Oh boy!
[02:14:50.834 --> 02:14:51.934]  Doesn't God curse us?
[02:14:52.214 --> 02:14:54.715]  It tastes delicious, it's wonderful, and it'll save your life.
[02:14:55.315 --> 02:15:01.716]  Things are already so toxic, so bad, you all need to be eating large quantities of berries in the morning and at dinner.
[02:15:02.137 --> 02:15:03.717]  I mean, a large bowl.
[02:15:04.317 --> 02:15:05.637]  I don't care how much it costs.
[02:15:07.178 --> 02:15:12.619]  And my children eat it, and they just glow compared to these other kids that are drinking Coca-Cola at age three.
[02:15:13.664 --> 02:15:15.285]  With little black circles around their eyes.
[02:15:15.345 --> 02:15:16.286]  My children just glow.
[02:15:16.306 --> 02:15:17.486]  People are like, look at those children!
[02:15:17.506 --> 02:15:18.427]  Oh, they're so beautiful!
[02:15:18.487 --> 02:15:19.348]  Oh, they're so wonderful!
[02:15:19.708 --> 02:15:20.428]  Oh, they're so cute!
[02:15:20.468 --> 02:15:21.329]  Oh, they're so smart!
[02:15:21.829 --> 02:15:22.890]  They're a lot healthier than I am.
[02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:24.331]  I'm an old, battered war horse.
[02:15:24.931 --> 02:15:27.473]  But, uh, you know, women who want to have beautiful skin.
[02:15:28.033 --> 02:15:28.813]  Who don't want to age.
[02:15:28.853 --> 02:15:33.837]  You don't need that slop, cream, collagen from melted down Chinese prisoners.
[02:15:34.217 --> 02:15:37.479]  Which a lot of the expensive brands have here in America and France and England.
[02:15:37.499 --> 02:15:38.539]  Mainstream news, mainstream news.
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:39.360]  Times of London.
[02:15:40.581 --> 02:15:42.282]  What you need is vitamin C.
[02:15:43.829 --> 02:15:49.574]  But the women's magazines are not going to tell you that because they don't make money out of it.
[02:15:50.935 --> 02:15:52.376]  Now there's a danger in berries.
[02:15:52.757 --> 02:15:58.762]  Berries out of Mexico and Guatemala are sprayed in human feces and are covered in hepatitis A, B and C. Mainstream News.
[02:15:59.249 --> 02:16:03.512]  So you've got to try to buy it from organic sources out of the U.S.
[02:16:03.572 --> 02:16:05.593]  and you still need to buy the citrus spray.
[02:16:05.993 --> 02:16:07.294]  You don't use chemicals to clean it.
[02:16:07.314 --> 02:16:10.256]  You put it in a bowl and you spray it with the citrus.
[02:16:10.616 --> 02:16:11.737]  And the citrus is an acid.
[02:16:11.797 --> 02:16:12.498]  It eats it off.
[02:16:12.538 --> 02:16:13.919]  Then you wash all of that off.
[02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:16.640]  There are different brands out there.
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:18.782]  But you don't want to use a soap-based one or a chemical-based one.
[02:16:19.462 --> 02:16:20.363]  And then you eat that.
[02:16:20.523 --> 02:16:23.805]  Because there's dangers everywhere.
[02:16:24.305 --> 02:16:27.287]  But I mean, I'm giving you the real, palpable, up-front dangers.
[02:16:27.347 --> 02:16:28.048]  Continuing though.
[02:16:30.456 --> 02:16:40.142]  Sebastian Petitie, MD, we're going to get him on, and Mark Levine, MD, discuss these cases of advanced cancers in the report.
[02:16:40.202 --> 02:16:45.505]  Patients in unexpectedly long survival times after receiving high-dose, intravenous vitamin C therapy.
[02:16:47.446 --> 02:16:52.789]  They use the guidelines from the National Center Institute for their case studies and say, in light of recent clinical
[02:16:54.255 --> 02:16:56.216]  Pharma Makotatinik.
[02:16:56.596 --> 02:16:58.758]  Again, I'm sorry for doctors out there, I can't pronounce this.
[02:16:59.198 --> 02:17:03.561]  Pharma... Phara... Marka Kinetic.
[02:17:03.701 --> 02:17:04.161]  There you go.
[02:17:04.581 --> 02:17:17.229]  Findings and in vitro evidence of anti-tumor mechanisms, these cases reports indicate that the role of high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy in cancer treatment should be reassessed.
[02:17:17.289 --> 02:17:18.049]  Well, of course!
[02:17:18.109 --> 02:17:19.170]  It's the building block!
[02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:21.071]  Let me tell you what the building block is.
[02:17:23.139 --> 02:17:24.280]  I forget the exact name of it.
[02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:37.647]  The good water, the good cholesterol, and vitamin C. Organic, ring-structured, organically derived, and absorbed through the stomach wall and intestinal wall.
[02:17:38.208 --> 02:17:38.948]  That is what you need.
[02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:40.389]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.289 --> 02:17:45.889]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:17:46.029 --> 02:17:50.170]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:53.151]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:59.953]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:00.133 --> 02:18:03.134]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:03.334 --> 02:18:05.734]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:05.854 --> 02:18:08.515]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[02:18:08.575 --> 02:18:08.975]  We're good to go!
[02:18:35.586 --> 02:18:38.670]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book, the most comprehensive edition ever published.
[02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:42.134]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[02:18:44.136 --> 02:18:45.597]  It includes the history of U.S.
[02:18:45.617 --> 02:18:45.758]  coins,
[02:18:57.958 --> 02:18:59.299]  The actual mintages.
[02:18:59.759 --> 02:19:00.960]  The grading standards.
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:03.222]  Learn the stability of real money.
[02:19:03.642 --> 02:19:05.703]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[02:19:06.103 --> 02:19:07.584]  They are instruments of death.
[02:19:07.885 --> 02:19:09.946]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[02:19:10.506 --> 02:19:14.249]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.

[02:19:15.550 --> 02:19:15.790]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:28.391 --> 02:19:30.172]  Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.
[02:19:30.752 --> 02:19:32.513]  Get the 2006 Red Buck.
[02:19:33.113 --> 02:19:35.014]  Help steer your own financial ship.

[02:19:43.866 --> 02:19:46.347]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:46.427 --> 02:19:53.249]  Did you know that at the 29 Palm Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[02:19:53.969 --> 02:19:57.311]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[02:19:57.971 --> 02:19:59.431]  Would the Marines accept this?
[02:19:59.631 --> 02:20:10.175]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[02:20:10.855 --> 02:20:12.316]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:20:12.416 --> 02:20:14.217]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[02:20:14.737 --> 02:20:22.300]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:24.501]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:30.363 --> 02:20:34.726]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:35.567 --> 02:20:36.608]  Call now.
[02:20:36.768 --> 02:20:43.232]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:43.753 --> 02:20:45.854]  Gee, honey, those new sandals look great on you.
[02:20:46.034 --> 02:20:48.316]  And look, they show off my new toenails, too.
[02:20:48.596 --> 02:20:49.276]  New toenails?
[02:20:49.657 --> 02:20:50.637]  What happened to the old ones?
[02:20:51.618 --> 02:20:54.280]  Well, they're not really new, just clear and healthy-looking.
[02:20:54.813 --> 02:20:56.256]  Remember how embarrassed I was?
[02:20:56.276 --> 02:20:59.060]  They were so discolored, really awful looking.
[02:20:59.281 --> 02:21:00.663]  Well, they sure look clear now.
[02:21:01.104 --> 02:21:02.807]  Gosh, I wish I could wear sandals again.
[02:21:02.947 --> 02:21:04.309]  My toenails are a disaster.
[02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:07.154]  Look, this one looks white, and that one's thick and yellow.
[02:21:07.174 --> 02:21:08.597]  Well, here's my secret.
[02:21:09.185 --> 02:21:10.205]  Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:10.686 --> 02:21:14.767]  It clears out yellowing keratin debris, the source of nail discoloration.
[02:21:15.467 --> 02:21:16.367]  Ah, so that's it.
[02:21:16.607 --> 02:21:19.188]  I've got ugly keratin debris built up under my nails.
[02:21:19.448 --> 02:21:21.109]  And Non-X Nail Gel gets rid of it.
[02:21:21.569 --> 02:21:24.650]  Now, you'll need to use it every day, but clear nails are worth it.
[02:21:25.050 --> 02:21:25.610]  You bet.
[02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:29.931]  You know, when we go to the beach this summer, my toenails are going to look just as good as yours do.
[02:21:30.071 --> 02:21:31.492]  Thanks to Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:31.992 --> 02:21:34.974]  Nonex Nail Gel, for clear, healthy-looking nails.
[02:21:35.334 --> 02:21:41.779]  Now at Walgreens, Rite Aid, Eckerd, Brooks, Long's, Duane Reade, and Walmart, in the foot care section.
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:49.704]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:51.665 --> 02:22:00.531]  Let me continue, this is three major studies, new studies out this year, out of Canada, and published,
[02:22:01.848 --> 02:22:04.630]  In the National Canadian Medical Society Journal.
[02:22:05.471 --> 02:22:06.431]  Let me just read this to you.
[02:22:08.233 --> 02:22:25.284]  They use the guidelines from the National Cancer Institute for their case studies and say, in light of recent clinical findings and in vitro evidence of anti-tumor mechanisms, these cases, reports indicate that the role of high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy in cancer treatment should be reassessed.
[02:22:26.562 --> 02:22:29.504]  The first case involved a 51-year-old woman with kidney cancer.
[02:22:30.144 --> 02:22:38.629]  She chose to forego conventional treatment and instead opted for alternative therapies including high-dose vitamin C therapy delivered twice a week for 10 months.
[02:22:38.749 --> 02:22:46.353]  Researchers say scans taken following therapy show the tumors disappeared and the cancer was kept in remission for four years.
[02:22:47.626 --> 02:22:53.550]  The patient, a smoker, ultimately developed lung cancer that did not respond to the same therapy and became fatal.
[02:22:54.170 --> 02:23:00.335]  Another report that a 49-year-old man with bladder cancer also suggested the treatment may be effective.
[02:23:00.735 --> 02:23:06.579]  He, too, opted for high-dose vitamin C therapy and other alternative methods to treat the cancer nine years after being diagnosed.
[02:23:06.599 --> 02:23:08.300]  Do you realize how long this study is?
[02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:12.242]  The patient is in good health with no reoccurrence of the disease.
[02:23:12.382 --> 02:23:16.665]  Finally, the third case study examines the status of women diagnosed with lymphoma.
[02:23:17.125 --> 02:23:25.430]  She agreed to radiation but declined chemotherapy, choosing instead to be treated with high-dose vitamin C. Ten years after her diagnosis, the patient remains in normal health.
[02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:36.697]  Based on these findings, these were high-risk cases where she usually died, the study authors say further clinical study as to the safety and efficacy of intervening as vitamin C is warranted.
[02:23:38.499 --> 02:23:45.582]  And, you know, I've got a family member, a close family member, not my mother, not my wife, but someone close in the family has breast cancer right now.
[02:23:45.602 --> 02:23:49.384]  I'm not going to go off into it, but family's pretty freaked out about that.
[02:23:49.404 --> 02:23:50.544]  I've been dealing with that this week.
[02:23:51.925 --> 02:23:56.207]  And I just need to go over there and force her to eat giant amounts of fruit.
[02:23:57.467 --> 02:24:04.831]  I know I've got other family listening that's family with her, and they all need to make her eat a bunch of fruit and start delivering the blueberries daily.
[02:24:04.851 --> 02:24:07.612]  It has the highest level of not just vitamin C, but the key
[02:24:09.493 --> 02:24:12.574]  Super saturation I've seen reported in blueberries.
[02:24:12.594 --> 02:24:15.075]  There are several other berries that do it too.
[02:24:16.055 --> 02:24:18.196]  And I've seen the studies, big medical studies.
[02:24:19.216 --> 02:24:21.337]  I'm telling you, pills are not as good.
[02:24:22.097 --> 02:24:23.558]  Your body does not absorb it.
[02:24:24.018 --> 02:24:28.319]  The stomach wall, the intestinal walls, look at it, see it, and pass it.
[02:24:28.799 --> 02:24:31.080]  And it binds up with other byproducts in the body.
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:37.942]  It needs to be absorbed by chewing well and eating large amounts of direct vitamin C.
[02:24:39.588 --> 02:24:44.350]  Vitamin C breaks down into a type of citric acid and then one other vitamin.
[02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:46.410]  I'm just going from the stuff I've read in the past.
[02:24:47.131 --> 02:24:50.192]  And so even orange juice has been sitting around for a few weeks.
[02:24:51.472 --> 02:24:53.413]  It isn't alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:53.533 --> 02:24:54.573]  It's dead, basically.
[02:24:55.013 --> 02:24:55.874]  Now, it's still good.
[02:24:56.814 --> 02:24:57.794]  It's better than pills.
[02:24:58.895 --> 02:25:05.017]  Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, kiwis,
[02:25:05.839 --> 02:25:10.423]  I know I keep repeating this, but this stuff is so good for you.
[02:25:11.644 --> 02:25:13.425]  And you've got to include it in your diet.
[02:25:15.006 --> 02:25:16.608]  You've got to include it in your diet.
[02:25:16.628 --> 02:25:17.248]  You've got to.
[02:25:17.268 --> 02:25:18.850]  I mean, an apple's got a little bit, but it's nothing.
[02:25:20.931 --> 02:25:23.033]  You're strong to the spinach because you eat your spinach.
[02:25:24.694 --> 02:25:26.736]  Spinach has a lot of these things you need in it.
[02:25:26.796 --> 02:25:27.717]  But forget the iron.
[02:25:28.878 --> 02:25:30.459]  That's what old wives tell you you need more of that.
[02:25:30.479 --> 02:25:32.921]  There's actually too much of that in most water supplies.
[02:25:33.581 --> 02:25:35.303]  But actual green leaf
[02:25:36.208 --> 02:25:40.091]  Spinach is good because it's high in vitamin C, and it's high in folic acid.
[02:25:41.532 --> 02:25:42.672]  Folic acid is another one.
[02:25:43.293 --> 02:25:47.676]  Very closely akin to vitamin C. And so, you know, this is what happened.
[02:25:48.216 --> 02:25:50.638]  Why do they call the British Limeys?
[02:25:51.718 --> 02:25:53.640]  You call Germans Krauts.
[02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:59.223]  You know, most slangs people think are slang names, because I'm Kraut and Limey in my background.
[02:25:59.924 --> 02:26:01.905]  I'm a Kraut-Limey mix with a few other things mixed in.
[02:26:02.834 --> 02:26:04.875]  Most of those names are not mean slangs.
[02:26:04.936 --> 02:26:06.276]  It's like when you hear the word Mick.
[02:26:06.897 --> 02:26:10.039]  Somebody may think that's a slang, but it just means they have Mick before their name.
[02:26:10.719 --> 02:26:16.303]  You know, Jack Mick Clam, or Sheriff Richard Mack.
[02:26:17.044 --> 02:26:19.045]  Mick, Mack, things like that.
[02:26:19.085 --> 02:26:21.907]  But British are known as limeys.
[02:26:23.522 --> 02:26:29.945]  Because 400 years ago, their scientists found out what was about 375 actually.
[02:26:30.625 --> 02:26:31.426]  Right around that number.
[02:26:31.486 --> 02:26:32.686]  I read a lot of naval history books.
[02:26:32.726 --> 02:26:34.847]  I'm into that in my off hours for some reason.
[02:26:34.867 --> 02:26:35.767]  I find it very interesting.
[02:26:35.787 --> 02:26:38.809]  I even like to read old ship's logs and things.
[02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:45.852]  But they found, their scientists, the Royal British Institute there in London discovered
[02:26:46.801 --> 02:26:52.383]  They didn't know what was doing it, but they were studying scurvy, and this is why the British Empire was able to take over.
[02:26:52.823 --> 02:27:02.626]  The French had a bigger navy at the time, the Dutch had a bigger navy, the Spanish did, but they would get a few thousand miles away from port, and all their teeth would fall out, old wounds would open back up, because they had scurvy.
[02:27:02.646 --> 02:27:06.867]  They didn't have vitamin C. And the British learned, I'll tell you what they learned when we get back.
[02:27:06.887 --> 02:27:08.848]  I mean, you pretty much know the answer.
[02:27:08.868 --> 02:27:09.728]  They're called linies.
[02:27:11.048 --> 02:27:12.629]  Because everywhere they went, they had lines.
[02:27:13.547 --> 02:27:24.453]  They were big and strong, 10,000 miles away, two years at sea, and they'd pull up against a... They'd pull up against a Spanish galleon three times their size and slaughter everyone.
[02:27:24.834 --> 02:27:27.615]  Because their enemy would be dying on their deck with no teeth.
[02:27:28.296 --> 02:27:28.996]  And they'd ride back.
[02:27:29.016 --> 02:27:30.257]  And they'd laugh at the liners.
[02:27:34.299 --> 02:27:35.220]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.700 --> 02:27:37.301]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.221 --> 02:27:40.903]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.036 --> 02:27:52.540]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.

[02:27:56.321 --> 02:28:02.404]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[02:29:44.608 --> 02:29:46.949]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:29:47.189 --> 02:29:49.229]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:56.412]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents or other dangerous toxins.
[02:29:56.692 --> 02:30:05.314]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company for the past 57 years has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[02:30:05.595 --> 02:30:10.196]  Now for the first time Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family.
[02:30:10.196 --> 02:30:10.396]  Absolutely!
[02:30:10.416 --> 02:30:14.458]  That's great news because Calvin Pure Soap is made from all natural ingredients.
[02:30:14.658 --> 02:30:17.099]  It's earth-friendly and completely environmentally safe.
[02:30:17.279 --> 02:30:21.601]  So if you want yesterday's values today for good old-fashioned pure soap, call 1-800-340-7091.
[02:30:25.282 --> 02:30:25.622]  So, 375 years ago,
[02:30:57.076 --> 02:31:10.344]  The Royal Institute there in London discovered that something in fresh fruits and vegetables, and mainly fruits, would make people not disintegrate.
[02:31:11.045 --> 02:31:24.413]  Because you can eat all the salt pork you want, all the hardtack, you can drink all the grog you want, that's rum mixed with water, three parts, three parts water, one part rum, and
[02:31:25.908 --> 02:31:26.608]  People will die.
[02:31:26.868 --> 02:31:33.811]  I mean, in just three or four months, your teeth start bleeding, your gums start bleeding, you start getting everywhere you ever had a cut.
[02:31:33.871 --> 02:31:38.573]  Say you got your eyebrow cut when you were a kid, that would just open up and start bleeding.
[02:31:39.014 --> 02:31:39.794]  You fall apart.
[02:31:41.235 --> 02:31:49.218]  Because you have to have vitamin C. And so the British were able to keep it secret for hundreds of years.
[02:31:50.166 --> 02:31:54.347]  Everyone noticed that the British were known as the Limeys, and people didn't like limes.
[02:31:54.367 --> 02:32:06.669]  There were old wives tales that you shouldn't take a bath, and you shouldn't eat limes, and you shouldn't eat, you know, that fruit was pretty much bad for you, and that what was good for you was minced meat mixed in with salt.
[02:32:06.989 --> 02:32:08.170]  That's what Europeans ate.
[02:32:09.310 --> 02:32:13.651]  I mean Magellan, he circumnavigated the globe.
[02:32:15.631 --> 02:32:16.331]  What was that?
[02:32:16.431 --> 02:32:18.412]  That was in like 1590-something, but
[02:32:19.904 --> 02:32:21.425]  He was able to circumnavigate the whole globe.
[02:32:21.445 --> 02:32:24.647]  Of course, he was killed by natives in the South Pacific himself.
[02:32:25.727 --> 02:32:29.409]  But when they got back, I think it was like 15 of the crew were still alive.
[02:32:29.949 --> 02:32:31.170]  The ship was falling apart.
[02:32:32.231 --> 02:32:36.413]  And they survived on eating rats.
[02:32:37.574 --> 02:32:49.858]  There were a lot of rats in the ship, and the old wives tale was, with the Spanish, which was actually right, that eating the guts of a rat, eating the raw intestines of a rat, would save you from scurvy, and it's true.
[02:32:50.538 --> 02:33:06.003]  Rodents, rodents, and only certain rodent species, are the, I don't know why I'm giving you all this trivia, this is the kind of stuff I read about, rodents are the only mammal species, and only certain rodents, but the European brown rat was the particular one,
[02:33:07.230 --> 02:33:11.391]  That actually produce vitamin C in their stomach and intestine.
[02:33:13.351 --> 02:33:14.091]  Amazing, isn't it?
[02:33:14.312 --> 02:33:15.272]  Incredible little creature.
[02:33:15.352 --> 02:33:19.293]  So, the only other place you could get it was eating raw rat guts.
[02:33:20.393 --> 02:33:21.433]  Wouldn't you rather eat a lime?
[02:33:21.473 --> 02:33:26.234]  So, the British would just have giant barrels full of limes.
[02:33:26.354 --> 02:33:30.815]  And even when they were dried, they would still ground them up into the gruel.
[02:33:30.835 --> 02:33:35.496]  Excuse me, well, the gruel as well, but the grog.
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:38.722]  And they would make them eat it.
[02:33:38.762 --> 02:33:53.855]  I mean, I've read reports where someone was refusing, or somebody didn't put the, you know, some cook didn't mix the lime juice in like they were supposed to with the rum, and he gets 40 lashes at the post, or people getting keelhauled for not picking up the limes.
[02:33:55.116 --> 02:33:57.598]  And limes was their favorite, because limes will last a long time.
[02:33:59.259 --> 02:34:04.384]  And so, literally, an entire empire
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:21.489]  A much smaller force of sailors and ships was able to take over the entire known world and muscle out three, really four, bigger empires because they were ignorant and laughed at the Limeys.
[02:34:21.989 --> 02:34:22.950]  The Limeys.
[02:34:24.451 --> 02:34:25.191]  The Limeys.
[02:34:25.231 --> 02:34:30.254]  Known because all over their ship would be, when they went off to sea, would just be huge bags and barrels of limes.
[02:34:31.735 --> 02:34:32.735]  And now I've spent 15-20 minutes on limes.
[02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:48.192]  But that goes back to conclusively, conclusively, and of course they don't come in with big giant bowls of blueberries, which are even better according to Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling and all these new studies.
[02:34:48.552 --> 02:34:59.774]  No, it has to be pharmacological, expensive, extracted, chemicalized, intravenously delivered vitamin C.
[02:35:01.013 --> 02:35:05.797]  When the studies show that it is the raw organic vitamin C is just many, many times better.
[02:35:05.817 --> 02:35:22.330]  But I have no doubt, intravenously bathing the body, bathing the tissues, bathing them directly in vitamin C knocks out the cancer and allows the body to go in and defeat the cancer.
[02:35:22.590 --> 02:35:23.871]  We all get cancer every day.
[02:35:24.372 --> 02:35:26.433]  Every hour we're getting cancer, especially as you get older.
[02:35:26.733 --> 02:35:27.834]  But your body's beating it.
[02:35:27.874 --> 02:35:28.455]  It finally
[02:35:29.583 --> 02:35:31.804]  Spreads, and you finally die.
[02:35:32.484 --> 02:35:37.307]  So this is really good news, and I've told you about it before, but the mainstream media likes to attack two-time.
[02:35:37.607 --> 02:35:38.227]  Two-time!
[02:35:38.987 --> 02:35:39.528]  Two-time!
[02:35:40.688 --> 02:35:41.389]  Nobel laureate.
[02:35:41.409 --> 02:35:45.610]  There are Nobel laureates who've done major studies showing sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride kills you.
[02:35:46.271 --> 02:35:47.331]  A toxic chemical.
[02:35:48.852 --> 02:35:50.533]  A toxic sedative.
[02:35:51.633 --> 02:35:52.934]  The Nazis used it, admittedly.
[02:35:53.134 --> 02:35:54.434]  Mainstream World War II history books.
[02:35:54.915 --> 02:35:55.475]  Still, you drink it.
[02:35:56.684 --> 02:36:03.249]  We know that the cell phones give you a brain tumor right through the skull, right at the point where the main radiation is ejected.
[02:36:03.350 --> 02:36:04.831]  It is a microwave transmitter.
[02:36:06.912 --> 02:36:07.253]  Deadly.
[02:36:08.574 --> 02:36:11.436]  If you live anywhere near a cell tower, you are totally insane.
[02:36:11.816 --> 02:36:13.838]  Within 300 yards of it, you're nuts.
[02:36:14.699 --> 02:36:15.039]  Deadly.
[02:36:15.179 --> 02:36:16.280]  Even more deadly than a cell phone.
[02:36:16.969 --> 02:36:18.390]  We know all this stuff is deadly.
[02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:19.431]  We know DU is deadly.
[02:36:19.471 --> 02:36:20.492]  And we don't stop.
[02:36:20.532 --> 02:36:21.273]  We get in the habit.
[02:36:21.753 --> 02:36:23.534]  We get in the habit of not eating fresh fruit.
[02:36:23.935 --> 02:36:25.816]  We get in the habit of not eating fresh vegetables.
[02:36:25.936 --> 02:36:27.437]  I mean, I have been doing it the last few months.
[02:36:27.477 --> 02:36:28.698]  I mean, I'm eating huge amounts.
[02:36:28.738 --> 02:36:29.179]  I feel great.
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:31.040]  We get in the habit.
[02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:31.861]  We get on the run.
[02:36:31.961 --> 02:36:34.143]  Everything's been made so easy for us to kill ourselves.
[02:36:34.863 --> 02:36:36.305]  It's now time to stop.
[02:36:36.325 --> 02:36:40.768]  You know, so many of the solutions against the New World Order are just taking control of our own lives.
[02:36:43.390 --> 02:36:44.231]  So many people
[02:36:45.026 --> 02:36:46.928]  In fact, I just thought of one of our sponsors.
[02:36:46.948 --> 02:36:47.748]  I ought to plug them.
[02:36:47.788 --> 02:36:49.670]  I haven't even plugged any of my stuff today, really.
[02:36:52.912 --> 02:36:53.532]  Oh, where is it?
[02:36:53.572 --> 02:36:54.513]  I had my folder in here.
[02:36:54.613 --> 02:36:57.575]  Did somebody take my folder out of here?
[02:36:57.816 --> 02:36:58.776]  I'll find it during the break.
[02:36:58.876 --> 02:37:01.719]  Just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:37:01.739 --> 02:37:04.981]  On the left-hand side, there's the CalBenPureSoap.com banner.
[02:37:05.481 --> 02:37:06.862]  CalBenPureSoap.com.
[02:37:06.882 --> 02:37:08.604]  C-A-L-BenSoap.com.
[02:37:08.964 --> 02:37:11.646]  CalBenPureSoap.com, or CalBenSoap.com's website.
[02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:13.770]  And the toll-free number is right there.
[02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:14.990]  You can get it on the side as well.
[02:37:16.491 --> 02:37:21.854]  And it's made out of coconut oil, cocoa butter, citrus.
[02:37:22.895 --> 02:37:23.635]  And I just love it.
[02:37:23.695 --> 02:37:25.877]  I slather myself under the arms with it.
[02:37:25.957 --> 02:37:26.917]  I wash my hair in it.
[02:37:26.937 --> 02:37:31.880]  If I leave a little bit in, you know, in the past, once a month or so, I forget and leave some soap between my legs or under my arms.
[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:32.620]  We all do it.
[02:37:32.700 --> 02:37:37.323]  And then burning it later in the day, you get all red and chafed by the time you get home and take a shower at night.
[02:37:38.850 --> 02:37:40.091]  Leave Cal Ben under your arms.
[02:37:40.651 --> 02:37:41.171]  You'll feel great.
[02:37:41.231 --> 02:37:42.732]  It's basically like a lubricant.
[02:37:44.272 --> 02:37:49.834]  And it costs 85% less because it's triple concentrated and it's not a big pharma company.
[02:37:50.714 --> 02:37:54.876]  You see, if you're a big chemical company 100 years ago, there's all these natural subs out there.
[02:37:54.916 --> 02:37:55.656]  You don't want that.
[02:37:57.197 --> 02:38:00.758]  So you come in and you create a monopoly and you popularize, chemicalize,
[02:38:01.835 --> 02:38:11.242]  Detergents, and dishwashing, and clothes washing, and bar soap, and hair soap, and you... And people pay a lot more for it.
[02:38:11.262 --> 02:38:17.326]  You monopolize all of the store shelf spaces and people get all, you know, basically poisoned from it.
[02:38:17.526 --> 02:38:18.807]  You can call and get a free catalog.
[02:38:19.168 --> 02:38:19.948]  Call on Calvin Sub.
[02:38:19.968 --> 02:38:24.431]  Before the show ends, last five minutes, I'll just, once, one time, give the phone number out and the web address.
[02:38:24.512 --> 02:38:26.073]  I'll dig it up here.
[02:38:27.334 --> 02:38:28.474]  I got a whole stack of folders here.
[02:38:28.514 --> 02:38:29.015]  It's one of these.
[02:38:30.652 --> 02:38:31.673]  CalbenPierceHub.com.
[02:38:31.713 --> 02:38:33.896]  Another thing, you always mention the big murkies.
[02:38:33.916 --> 02:38:37.000]  I mean, the water, the allowable stuff they put in the water.
[02:38:38.121 --> 02:38:39.262]  What is acceptable?
[02:38:39.322 --> 02:38:42.166]  The chlorine, the mercury, the arsenic, the lead.
[02:38:43.915 --> 02:38:46.676]  Anywhere near a reactor, you're going to have uranium in the water.
[02:38:46.716 --> 02:38:47.577]  That's mainstream news.
[02:38:47.617 --> 02:38:49.957]  It's just all over, and they just say, oh, it's not bad for you anymore.
[02:38:50.198 --> 02:38:50.838]  We say it's safe.
[02:38:51.258 --> 02:38:52.739]  See, it used to be, oh, it's deadly now.
[02:38:52.939 --> 02:38:54.059]  Oh, no, we say it's good for you.
[02:38:54.299 --> 02:38:55.920]  That's how crazy it's gotten.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:39:05.924]  We're a country with cell phones up to our heads, not eating fruit and vegetables, running around drinking aspartame and eating aspartame, which is what alcohol, that's what the molecule is.
[02:39:06.444 --> 02:39:11.626]  It's got one more little thing added onto it, and that breaks up as soon as it hits 87 degrees for more than 10 minutes.
[02:39:12.206 --> 02:39:13.927]  In your stomach it turns into what, alcohol?
[02:39:14.327 --> 02:39:16.228]  You ever heard of bathtub gin making you go blind?
[02:39:16.709 --> 02:39:17.809]  It's poison, boys and girls.
[02:39:18.409 --> 02:39:30.456]  We just are killing ourselves, and we're sitting here with foreigners running around, waving Mexican flags, and Nicaraguan flags, and Venezuelan flags, and our government's giving our military bases over to the Communist Chinese openly.
[02:39:31.296 --> 02:39:32.597]  Notice that didn't turn into a big issue.
[02:39:32.617 --> 02:39:33.737]  The media shut that down.
[02:39:34.518 --> 02:39:40.221]  Oh, if it gets us mad at the Arabs, we can, you know, get Bush in trouble, but if it's the official Chinese military taking over bases, it's okay.
[02:39:42.465 --> 02:39:47.809]  Yes, that company, Hutchinson Wampoa, is openly owned by the Communist Chinese Navy, publicly.
[02:39:47.829 --> 02:39:49.030]  Their own website admits it.
[02:39:51.211 --> 02:39:51.912]  Running security.
[02:39:53.653 --> 02:39:54.754]  I'm living in Twilight Zone.
[02:39:55.194 --> 02:39:56.675]  See, I mean, it's just all nuts.
[02:39:58.062 --> 02:40:00.365]  And doing the right thing for yourself is good.
[02:40:00.445 --> 02:40:02.148]  It's good to eat luscious fruit.
[02:40:02.588 --> 02:40:04.310]  It's good to eat papaya.
[02:40:04.390 --> 02:40:05.712]  It's good to eat watermelon.
[02:40:05.752 --> 02:40:08.255]  It's good to eat pineapple.
[02:40:08.335 --> 02:40:09.797]  It's good to eat strawberries.
[02:40:10.178 --> 02:40:11.479]  But we still don't do it.
[02:40:11.539 --> 02:40:12.821]  We love death.
[02:40:13.722 --> 02:40:16.626]  We have something known to absolutely knock out cancer.
[02:40:20.683 --> 02:40:28.049]  In fact, they've done big studies that we'd be living to 125 right now because of the nutrition that's available and the health nuts that have been eating healthy for 50 years.
[02:40:28.529 --> 02:40:34.073]  These people are out riding their bicycles around at 105 years old, visiting their great-great-grandkids, having a wonderful life.
[02:40:34.834 --> 02:40:39.277]  Because, in all of them, every time you check into it, they eat tons of fruits and vegetables.
[02:40:41.599 --> 02:40:43.060]  And most of them are vegetarians.
[02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:44.081]  I'm not a vegetarian.
[02:40:44.141 --> 02:40:44.561]  I should be.
[02:40:46.545 --> 02:40:53.991]  Now about vegetarian, they still get some animal fat through eggs and animal protein through eggs.
[02:40:54.051 --> 02:40:56.253]  Most of the pure vegetarians don't.
[02:40:57.114 --> 02:41:02.018]  They live longer than the general American, but not as long as the people that have a balanced diet.
[02:41:02.618 --> 02:41:03.719]  And I should really do that too.
[02:41:03.819 --> 02:41:06.241]  I just always count myself as if they're going to kill me any day now.
[02:41:06.281 --> 02:41:09.424]  So it tends to make me a little bit reckless and not care about myself.
[02:41:09.464 --> 02:41:12.867]  But I need to because your brain works better when you are healthy.
[02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:16.791]  Okay, let's get into something really serious here.
[02:41:17.151 --> 02:41:29.297]  Army bans use of privately bought body armor, and they're making them accept level 2 body armor that will not even stop a .308 round at 50 yards away.
[02:41:30.597 --> 02:41:32.038]  It won't even stop it at 100 yards away.
[02:41:32.478 --> 02:41:33.719]  It won't even stop most shrapnel.
[02:41:34.346 --> 02:41:40.650]  And when these guys get blown to bits, this has been in the Associated Press, mainstream news, they cut the body armor off of them at a field hospital.
[02:41:41.070 --> 02:41:45.392]  The stuff would be $150 in an army supply store if anybody would even buy it.
[02:41:45.432 --> 02:41:46.613]  It's total junk.
[02:41:47.673 --> 02:41:49.635]  It's not even good as Vietnam era flak jackets.
[02:41:50.195 --> 02:41:56.078]  And then there's a big scandal about the company supplying all the troops, making it substandard to make huge profits.
[02:41:57.479 --> 02:41:59.400]  Well, the troops have been paying for their own body armor.
[02:42:01.838 --> 02:42:04.060]  And this is out of the Associated Press.
[02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:06.002]  Army bans use of privately bought armor.
[02:42:06.422 --> 02:42:10.105]  Soldiers will no longer be able to wear body armor other than the protective gear issued by the military.
[02:42:10.485 --> 02:42:16.570]  Army officials said Thursday, the latest twist in a running battle over the equipment the Pentagon gives its troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:42:17.011 --> 02:42:18.012]  Army officials told AP,
[02:42:18.932 --> 02:42:30.003]  That the order was prompted by concerns that soldiers and their families were buying inadequate or untested commercial armor from private companies, including the popular dragon skin gear made by California-based Pinnacle Armor.
[02:42:30.363 --> 02:42:32.966]  Which I've looked at what the law enforcement says about that.
[02:42:33.006 --> 02:42:36.209]  It's much better than the substandard crap.
[02:42:36.990 --> 02:42:37.811]  And it is crap.
[02:42:38.711 --> 02:42:41.254]  They're giving them level 2 body armor.
[02:42:46.559 --> 02:42:47.060]  And it goes on.
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:52.405]  We're very concerned that people are spending their hard-earned money on something that doesn't provide the level of protection the Army requires people to wear.
[02:42:52.866 --> 02:42:59.253]  So they're frankly wasting their money on substandard stuff, said Colonel Thomas Sofer, Director of Material for the Army.
[02:42:59.873 --> 02:43:04.979]  Murray Neal, Chief Executive of Pinnacle, said he hadn't seen the directive and wants a review.
[02:43:06.013 --> 02:43:09.435]  We know of no reason why the Army may have to justify this action, Neal said.
[02:43:09.756 --> 02:43:20.884]  On the surface, this looks to be another of many attempts by the Army to cover up the billions and billions of dollars spent on ineffective body armor systems, which they continue to try quick fixes on to no avail.
[02:43:20.904 --> 02:43:23.966]  Yeah, like they send them armored Humvees that aren't armored on the bottom.
[02:43:24.686 --> 02:43:26.728]  I mean, that's where the bombs come from!
[02:43:26.748 --> 02:43:29.470]  That's what mines do and IEDs.
[02:43:30.911 --> 02:43:34.353]  And then the neocons get on TV and go, they've got plenty of armor, that's a liberal lie.
[02:43:34.573 --> 02:43:35.394]  I've talked to the troops.
[02:43:36.292 --> 02:43:47.760]  Yeah, they take them behind the bases and they use them inside the controlled zones and the generals and people drive around all cowardly in those behind the lines and then the troops don't get anything when they're outside the bases in some cases.
[02:43:50.482 --> 02:43:51.263]  And it goes on.
[02:43:51.363 --> 02:43:52.704]  The move was a rare one for the Army.
[02:43:52.944 --> 02:43:55.926]  Sofer said he doesn't recall any similar bans on personal armor or devices.
[02:43:56.327 --> 02:43:59.909]  And you've always been allowed to have your own guns and weapons and knives and gear.
[02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:02.231]  It goes back to the Roman legions.
[02:44:02.893 --> 02:44:07.436]  The devices are most often issued when there are problems with aircraft or other large equipment.
[02:44:08.177 --> 02:44:10.078]  Veterans groups immediately denounced the decision.
[02:44:10.919 --> 02:44:19.124]  Nandler L. Helms, editor of Soldier of Truth online magazine Defense Watch, said he has already received a number of emails from soldiers complaining about the policy.
[02:44:19.785 --> 02:44:19.925]  Ha!
[02:44:20.165 --> 02:44:21.446]  You gotta love this though, man.
[02:44:21.506 --> 02:44:21.906]  Imagine.
[02:44:22.527 --> 02:44:25.949]  You get a mortar shell goes off in one of the famous cases.
[02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:28.811]  Blew one of the young man's arms off.
[02:44:29.454 --> 02:44:34.497]  They only had to amputate some of the fingers off the other, dig a bunch of shrapnel out of his face and spine, he had it all over him.
[02:44:35.077 --> 02:44:37.658]  It was shattered, garbage body armor.
[02:44:38.099 --> 02:44:41.941]  The shrapnel went right through it, and folks, shrapnel should not be going through body armor.
[02:44:42.581 --> 02:44:51.706]  I mean, good body armor, level 3, you can stand right up to it with a .357 Magnum or a .30-06 and pump rounds into the breastplate, or into the other plates, and it's not going to go through.
[02:44:51.746 --> 02:44:53.167]  It's going to hurt you, it's going to break some ribs.
[02:44:54.091 --> 02:44:56.093]  No, it goes right through it.
[02:44:56.433 --> 02:44:59.015]  I think I've seen online reports of soldiers taking photographs of it.
[02:44:59.555 --> 02:45:01.476]  I mean, it just shoots right through it.
[02:45:03.077 --> 02:45:03.878]  Right through it.
[02:45:05.779 --> 02:45:18.028]  And then when they cut that body armor off while somebody's fighting for their life in one of these field hospitals, they get a $700 bill for stuff that no one would even buy, that police wouldn't even wear.
[02:45:19.128 --> 02:45:25.449]  And it was in the news that a rich New York defense contractor sold most of the stuff to him and it's not even level 2.
[02:45:27.970 --> 02:45:29.750]  It's not even level 2.
[02:45:31.151 --> 02:45:32.591]  Oh, but you love the war.
[02:45:33.171 --> 02:45:34.411]  You make me sick.
[02:45:36.632 --> 02:45:38.412]  The Iran situation is really big.
[02:45:38.472 --> 02:45:41.193]  Iran finally rejects the new UN demands.
[02:45:41.993 --> 02:45:43.733]  Again, they have a peaceful program.
[02:45:45.774 --> 02:45:46.094]  Nothing.
[02:45:49.398 --> 02:45:52.782]  In there, nothing they're doing in their nuclear program is dangerous.
[02:45:52.802 --> 02:45:55.104]  They're nine years away from an A-bomb if they were left alone.
[02:45:55.945 --> 02:46:11.421]  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned Iran on Thursday the international community is united in the dispute over its nuclear program, but a Tehran envoy defiantly rejected a UN call to propose a freeze on uranium enrichment.
[02:46:13.197 --> 02:46:18.659]  Rice spoke after a meeting in Berlin among diplomats from the five veto-wielding members of the U.S.
[02:46:18.679 --> 02:46:24.782]  Security Council, plus Germany, over ways to press Iran to stop enriching uranium, which can be used for weapons.
[02:46:25.742 --> 02:46:27.263]  Iran says its program is peaceful.
[02:46:27.963 --> 02:46:34.786]  So, it's a repeat of what happened a couple years ago, three and a half years ago, with the U.N.
[02:46:36.327 --> 02:46:42.169]  They certified they were in violation, they certified they probably had WMDs, and the invasion took place.
[02:46:42.978 --> 02:46:51.989]  And so for those of you that like wars and like to sit in your easy chair giggling as our troops get blown to bits and run around in defective body armor and breathe to you, you're probably going to get another attack.
[02:46:52.009 --> 02:46:52.850]  Will it happen this month?
[02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:53.791]  Will it happen in six months?
[02:46:54.683 --> 02:46:58.465]  A couple months ago, everybody was saying the attack would happen on the 28th of March, guaranteed.
[02:46:58.825 --> 02:47:00.005]  Oh, Alex, you're wrong.
[02:47:00.125 --> 02:47:01.186]  Alex is an evil fad.
[02:47:01.206 --> 02:47:02.206]  He says they won't attack.
[02:47:02.226 --> 02:47:02.867]  He's a liar.
[02:47:03.287 --> 02:47:06.388]  He's a... No, I just said that in the next six months.
[02:47:06.408 --> 02:47:10.390]  That's what Pat Buchanan is saying, from his inside sources, six months to a year.
[02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:13.511]  You know, they said they'd invade Iraq in March 2002.
[02:47:14.312 --> 02:47:15.352]  They invaded in March 2003.
[02:47:16.312 --> 02:47:18.693]  They like to just keep announcing and keep announcing.
[02:47:18.713 --> 02:47:19.454]  And you go, what do you mean?
[02:47:19.474 --> 02:47:21.234]  They're going to strike 200 sites, 200-something sites.
[02:47:22.959 --> 02:47:24.180]  214 sites to be precise.
[02:47:24.641 --> 02:47:25.841]  But what do you mean invade?
[02:47:25.922 --> 02:47:33.628]  Oh no, they're already saying they're going to take about 10% of Iran, that western area east of Basra, which just so happens to have over half their oil reserves.
[02:47:34.909 --> 02:47:39.312]  Most of their oil reserves, around half of them, are right up against the border with southern Iraq.
[02:47:40.513 --> 02:47:41.234]  Or central Iraq.
[02:47:41.974 --> 02:47:46.439]  And so they're going to quote a security zone because the Iranians are bringing IEDs in.
[02:47:46.459 --> 02:47:48.481]  And so we have to take the oil.
[02:47:48.801 --> 02:47:50.223]  And of course they won't pump the oil out.
[02:47:50.263 --> 02:47:54.948]  The idea is to freeze that oil to then jack up the value of all the other oil reserves held by the globalists.
[02:47:55.288 --> 02:48:04.058]  See, Saddam got in trouble in 1990 for quote over-pumping to try to pay off his 30-something million dollar debt to BCCI, the bank run by those crooks in the bushes.
[02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:10.542]  So those of you that go, they don't want all of the oil production down, Alex!
[02:48:10.943 --> 02:48:12.063]  We didn't go in there for oil!
[02:48:13.064 --> 02:48:13.784]  Yes, they did.
[02:48:13.864 --> 02:48:17.326]  The PNAC documents, others said they want to restrict oil production to jack up prices.
[02:48:17.546 --> 02:48:20.347]  And look at oil company profits, record highs, and it's not free market.
[02:48:20.367 --> 02:48:23.489]  You know, when the mafia robs somebody, that's not a free market profit.
[02:48:23.509 --> 02:48:25.530]  It's crony capitalism.
[02:48:26.670 --> 02:48:27.271]  It's not even that.
[02:48:27.311 --> 02:48:29.071]  It's like mercantile mafioso.
[02:48:29.992 --> 02:48:34.374]  Huge news blast of a bunch of articles in the final segment.
[02:48:35.399 --> 02:48:36.239]  You'll want to stay with us.
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:40.902]  Don't forget, we've got that special, five months free at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:48:41.322 --> 02:48:43.363]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:48:45.324 --> 02:48:48.166]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:48.446 --> 02:48:50.027]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:50.367 --> 02:48:55.049]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:55.369 --> 02:48:59.812]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:00.232 --> 02:49:04.394]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:04.614 --> 02:49:07.456]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.

[02:49:44.645 --> 02:49:46.266]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:46.406 --> 02:49:50.509]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:50.629 --> 02:49:53.531]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:53.591 --> 02:50:00.316]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:00.496 --> 02:50:03.499]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:03.719 --> 02:50:06.100]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:06.221 --> 02:50:10.944]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:11.124 --> 02:50:25.709]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[02:51:21.206 --> 02:51:21.466]  I think so.
[02:51:52.211 --> 02:51:54.613]  Can you believe we're gonna attack Iran?
[02:51:55.994 --> 02:51:58.616]  Oh, they're gonna do it.
[02:51:58.817 --> 02:52:03.481]  These lying crooks that have been caught lying about everything else.
[02:52:03.521 --> 02:52:06.343]  They claim our sovereignty, our security demands it.
[02:52:06.624 --> 02:52:07.725]  Yeah, the global bankers.
[02:52:08.205 --> 02:52:10.007]  Oh, they sell out our entire infrastructure.
[02:52:11.368 --> 02:52:13.310]  Oh, they give our troops substandard junk.
[02:52:15.285 --> 02:52:18.008]  Senate panel set to consider bid to censure Bush.
[02:52:18.429 --> 02:52:32.024]  Former White House Counsel John Dean, who helped President Richard Nixon from office during the Watergate scandal three decades ago, heads to Capitol Hill on Friday to back an uphill attempt to censure President George W. Bush.
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:43.124]  Author of the book entitled, Worse Than Watergate, was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of a resolution to rebuke Bush for a domestic spying program introduced on September 11th.
[02:52:43.524 --> 02:52:46.745]  Which is, by the way, totally illegal, and he didn't even need to do that.
[02:52:46.945 --> 02:52:47.866]  He's just setting a precedent.
[02:52:49.526 --> 02:52:52.888]  Senator Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, introduced the resolution earlier this month.
[02:52:53.268 --> 02:52:59.510]  He argues that the program, which allows eavesdropping on international telephone calls, may have the Pentagon spying on us domestically.
[02:52:59.530 --> 02:53:00.591]  I mean, see, it's much worse.
[02:53:01.209 --> 02:53:07.071]  Involving Americans, when one party is suspected of links to terrorism, violates the law because it is conducted without a court warrant.
[02:53:07.391 --> 02:53:13.274]  And again, the FISA court is just a blank check to begin with.
[02:53:13.334 --> 02:53:14.154]  It's retroactive.
[02:53:14.214 --> 02:53:21.937]  So, the excuse of, you know, if your wife's pregnant and having a baby, you don't call the judge to ask if you can speed, you just speed.
[02:53:22.799 --> 02:53:25.503]  You can already speed, even if the terror threat was real.
[02:53:26.184 --> 02:53:30.570]  Actor and director Ed Asner shares 9-11 concerns, highlights story of hijacker still alive and well.
[02:53:30.991 --> 02:53:35.477]  Powerful article we put out last night on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:53:35.497 --> 02:53:37.761]  Be sure and get that and get it out to people and go read the details.
[02:53:39.201 --> 02:53:46.265]  Another article about coming up this weekend, a scheduled meeting with Hugo Chavez by Jimmy Walter and William Rodriguez concerning the inside job of 9-11.
[02:53:46.665 --> 02:53:53.669]  They may be going, they reported they are going to be going, most likely on the TV show that Hugo Chavez has every Sunday.
[02:53:54.049 --> 02:53:55.430]  So we'll watch for that to happen.
[02:53:55.450 --> 02:53:56.330]  That's big news.
[02:53:57.070 --> 02:54:00.732]  Bush is reassuring Mexico on the migrants, the illegal aliens.
[02:54:01.193 --> 02:54:04.874]  BBC, President Bush has said he supports immigration to the U.S.
[02:54:05.195 --> 02:54:07.616]  from Mexico and Central America so long as it is orderly.
[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:11.243]  Yes, as long as you orderly take over and say you're going to destroy America.
[02:54:11.663 --> 02:54:17.668]  Mr. Bush was speaking during talks with his Mexican counterpart, Vicente Fox, at the start of the two-day summit in Cancun, also involved in Canada.
[02:54:18.329 --> 02:54:24.374]  And he says he wants his, quote, guest worker program, which is a blanket total amnesty.
[02:54:24.434 --> 02:54:26.496]  And Bush tries to lie to you and tell you it isn't.
[02:54:26.796 --> 02:54:29.859]  Go read the legislation introduced by Democrats that he supports.
[02:54:29.959 --> 02:54:33.642]  Total amnesty for whoever's here, whoever can get here for six years.
[02:54:34.950 --> 02:54:36.711]  Blair to be gone by Christmas, say friends.
[02:54:36.751 --> 02:54:39.633]  Tony Blair is announcing his resignation by Christmas.
[02:54:39.674 --> 02:54:49.761]  Members of his inner circle believe the Prime Minister's closest aides feel that following a series of damaging fights over education and sleaze, he will quit within nine months.
[02:54:49.781 --> 02:54:51.042]  He's been caught taking bribes.
[02:54:52.343 --> 02:54:53.483]  Doesn't get in trouble for that, though.
[02:54:54.004 --> 02:54:56.626]  I mean, that's the way America and Britain operates now.
[02:54:57.066 --> 02:54:58.387]  Criminality right out in the open.
[02:54:59.225 --> 02:55:00.226]  I am out of time here.
[02:55:00.506 --> 02:55:04.968]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back Monday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:55:05.068 --> 02:55:19.775]  Watch InfoWars tonight, because we sent Kevin and Ryan Slickheisen and Aaron and others up there to videotape Chairman Keenan's 9-11 whitewash meeting up at the University up in Georgetown, north of Austin.
[02:55:20.316 --> 02:55:22.797]  And they were going to ask him some pointed questions at the press conference.
[02:55:22.837 --> 02:55:23.997]  So were other Austinites.
[02:55:24.558 --> 02:55:26.719]  And they were going to unfurl a little banner, too.
[02:55:28.291 --> 02:55:30.749]  Saying that 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:55:33.383 --> 02:55:34.843]  So, we'll see what happens with that.
[02:55:34.863 --> 02:55:36.184]  That'll all be up on the side.
[02:55:36.224 --> 02:55:37.544]  We'll see how successful that was.
[02:55:37.564 --> 02:55:38.524]  I'm sure they did a great job.
[02:55:38.984 --> 02:55:43.606]  You want to expose what really happened on 9-11 and help expose the perpetrators and support this broadcast?
