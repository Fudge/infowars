[00:00:01.511 --> 00:00:02.312]  Welcome to everyone.
[00:00:02.312 --> 00:00:19.671]  We've got about 51 minutes left here today and there's just a plethora, an entire archipelago of just overt criminal activities in our faces.
[00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:20.172]  In our face.
[00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.152]  And I want to talk to Michael Rivera about just the propaganda.
[00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:39.305]  How they tell us that, oh look, these Iraqi newspapers are all free, we brought them freedom, and look, they love the government and they love the occupation, and it turns out no one's allowed to write anything anti-US or anti-globalist, or they're taking over.
[00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:42.528]  And it's all paid for, and that news is used here domestically.
[00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:46.632]  And they have the military surveilling us here domestically.
[00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:55.577]  And then, meanwhile, we have the Pentagon program ordering soldiers to promote Iraq war while at home on leave.
[00:00:55.577 --> 00:00:56.857]  Well, I've heard this myself.
[00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:59.679]  I don't even have to now see it in the mainstream news.
[00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.861]  I hear all over talk radio, all over TV, soldiers saying the same script.
[00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:06.242]  I mean, it's not even well written.
[00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:07.643]  This is un-American.
[00:01:07.643 --> 00:01:15.867]  Even if you love this war and want to kill every Arab on the planet, having our military run around and engage in domestic psyops is totally un-American.
[00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:19.374]  And the people are against this war.
[00:01:19.374 --> 00:01:23.878]  There's nothing the globalists can do to put it back together again unless they carry out another terror attack.
[00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:25.139]  So I want to get into that.
[00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:32.786]  And also I want to talk about DynCorp and Halliburton and the sex slaves and how now we have governors of Illinois and big papers.
[00:01:33.446 --> 00:01:42.450]  Going public and reporting on this, that our government is letting lobbyists run around on the Hill, lobbying against the Pentagon, stopping these practices.
[00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.111]  Michael Rivero, it's always great to have you join us once a month.
[00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:46.311]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.312]  Well, thanks for having me on the show, Alex.
[00:01:48.312 --> 00:01:49.092]  You bet.
[00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:55.115]  WhatReallyHappened.com, a real beacon out there of alternative news and information, and we're always honored to have you with us.
[00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:59.399]  I just mentioned four or five things that I'd like to get your take on.
[00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.261]  Any other things that you think we should get in?
[00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:13.215]  I mean, I would imagine that you want to talk about their Spiegel and Jerusalem Post, our criminal government telling Turkey, hey, we're about to use your bases to bomb Iran.
[00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:15.157]  Yeah, whether Turkey wants it or not.
[00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:16.859]  It seems to be an ongoing debate.
[00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:24.581]  Where apparently Putin met with the leadership in Turkey and basically convinced them that this was not a good idea.
[00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:32.703]  Because ultimately any attack on Iran is going to involve Russian nationals who are currently working at the construction sites for the power stations.
[00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:42.485]  So Putin went in and got a commitment from the government of Turkey to not allow the US to use their territory to launch attacks from.
[00:02:42.845 --> 00:02:43.725]  But of course, the U.S.
[00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:46.486]  is attempting to pressure Turkey back the other way.
[00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:58.169]  All of this, of course, pulls together with other indications that Bush does intend to carry out an attack on Iran for absolutely no reason at all other than he and his neocon buddies seem to want it.
[00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.150]  They're not even bothering trying to come up with some kind of an excuse or justification.
[00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.531]  They're just saying, you know, they've got nuclear sites, therefore we are justified in attacking them, which of course is completely silly.
[00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:11.172]  Nobody deserves to be attacked for having a
[00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:13.672]  A power station.
[00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:22.974]  And I want to get back to this whole issue, when we went over this during the run-up to the war in Iraq, where we were being told that Iraq was building nuclear bombs.
[00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:27.435]  And it's very hard to take Bush serious about it, because he can't even pronounce the word correctly.
[00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:29.276]  Nuclear!
[00:03:29.276 --> 00:03:29.976]  Nuclear!
[00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.416]  Nuclear bombs there.
[00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:34.197]  But what you need to look back at is the U.S.
[00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:40.388]  We're still paying for this tremendously capable nuclear deterrent.
[00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:43.129]  We have Ohio-class submarines.
[00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.030]  We have cruise missiles.
[00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.771]  We have ballistic missiles.
[00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:50.093]  We can lay waste to any country on Earth that dares to attack us.
[00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:55.596]  Well, for Bush or anybody else to get up there and say that Iraq or Iran is a danger to the U.S.
[00:03:55.596 --> 00:04:01.220]  because they might be developing a nuclear bomb, is in essence saying that the nuclear deterrent, the U.S.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.284]  nuclear deterrent that we paid trillions of dollars to build and maintain, does not work, because it's not deterring an attack.
[00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:11.927]  So there is a tremendously strange disconnect.
[00:04:11.927 --> 00:04:20.153]  Also, Bill Gertz, who really ought to write a story about CIA operatives in the media, I bet he could really give us a good inside story.
[00:04:20.153 --> 00:04:21.234]  What do you think, Mike?
[00:04:21.234 --> 00:04:22.675]  He's such an expert on it.
[00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:32.183]  Why, they've got magic bombs that are going to EMP us like Bugs Bunny's death ray or Marvin the Martian, and we're going to be back in the Stone Age, it's said.
[00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:48.149]  Well, it's just a lot of scaremongering, and the bottom line is that Iraq and Iran and those countries can build all the atomic bombs they want and put them in museums or run them on parades, but the bottom line is that they're not a threat to the U.S.
[00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:55.093]  because, you know, we have the capability of, you know, simply wiping an attacking country off the face of the earth.
[00:04:57.452 --> 00:05:07.477]  Well, listen, North Korea is running around threatening to nuke us, China threatens to nuke us, and then, oh, they're our friends, but, oh, we better attack Iran right now.
[00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:14.180]  Yeah, absolutely, and of course, as was the case in Iraq, there is no evidence that Iran is building nuclear weapons of any kind.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.602]  They're doing everything that is consistent with building a power station.
[00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:28.246]  Now it's clear, the CIA's own documents, not the Koch ones, but the real ones say, and this was a few months ago, that it will take 10 years for them to have a nuclear device.
[00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:29.166]  10 years to do it.
[00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:31.947]  Meanwhile, the neocons, the very same liars,
[00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:40.955]  Or three years ago, or on TV, CNN, Fox, you name it, saying they could have a bomb within three months and kill us all.
[00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:42.196]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:42.196 --> 00:05:48.822]  And it's the same rhetoric we heard going into Iraq, that they could attack us in 45 minutes, and all of it turned out to be a lie.
[00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:53.866]  They cannot be so disconnected from the American public that they think anybody is believing it again.
[00:05:53.866 --> 00:06:01.772]  I think it is just they're going through the motions to justify an attack they're going to carry out, and they're basically relying on the American people to not stand up
[00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.673]  And slap them in the nose and saying you should not to do this anymore.
[00:06:05.673 --> 00:06:08.575]  But it is very clear that... Mike, do you think they're going to attack Iran?
[00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:11.897]  Yes, I believe that they're going to attack Iran, possibly Syria.
[00:06:11.897 --> 00:06:14.439]  They're going to keep on going until... Now, I've been saying this for years.
[00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.299]  You've been saying this for years.
[00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:16.800]  People are like, they're not that crazy.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.941]  They wouldn't dare.
[00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:19.262]  Listen, this is their agenda.
[00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:24.686]  This is a criminal group that is attempting to use the military domestically against the American people.
[00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:27.148]  Give us your take on all the domestic propaganda.
[00:06:27.148 --> 00:06:29.970]  I mean, I don't think people realize how widespread this is.
[00:06:31.114 --> 00:06:37.196]  The propaganda is becoming, we're becoming saturated in it, is really what it comes down to.
[00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:46.319]  We have, you know, the scandals where the White House was paying reporters to write favorable pieces in the newspaper, the American newspapers.
[00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:54.602]  We had, only a few years ago, where military psyops operatives were actually working in places like the CNN newsrooms.
[00:06:54.602 --> 00:06:55.162]  We had
[00:06:56.344 --> 00:07:00.845]  Places, you know, situations where we just found out that the U.S.
[00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:07.187]  government is paying journalists in Iraq to write favorable news and forbidding the writing of any negative news about what's going on.
[00:07:07.187 --> 00:07:14.809]  Hundreds of them, hundreds of them, and then knowing that that news is then telegraphed here, meanwhile, lying on our news saying there's total freedom of press over there.
[00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:16.180]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.624]  Well, of course, if you're going to use the media to lie to the population, you have to first of all convince them that the media is not going to be lying.
[00:07:22.624 --> 00:07:28.028]  You know, if you live in a country where you know the press is simply parroting what the government says, you're going to ignore them.
[00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:36.293]  So for the propaganda campaign to be effective, the first and biggest lie they have to put out there is that the press is uncontrolled by the government.
[00:07:36.293 --> 00:07:38.355]  We now know for a fact that that is not the case.
[00:07:39.136 --> 00:07:44.706]  The government uses all kinds of covert and overt means to sway the media in their favor.
[00:07:44.706 --> 00:07:46.870]  Holding out those seats on Air Force One.
[00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.097]  Reporters aren't going to say anything bad about the government as long as they get a free ride in the back of that 747.
[00:07:52.742 --> 00:08:03.414]  So, uh, between that and outright bribes, and now we find out that the government has been bugging journalists, uh, without warrants to find out, you know, things that can be used to persuade them.
[00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:04.215]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:08:04.215 --> 00:08:09.201]  We all know the NSA's been spying on us for decades, and then Bush tries to use that as a rationale.
[00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:09.842]  No, that makes it...
[00:08:10.502 --> 00:08:14.025]  It absolutely is, and I think a big part of this whole current bugging scandal
[00:08:30.337 --> 00:08:34.058]  As you said, the NSA has been doing this for years.
[00:08:34.058 --> 00:08:35.178]  It's really not new.
[00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:40.240]  But I think the reason it was allowed out is Bush realizes he's losing the public relations battle.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:47.262]  He is losing support for future wars, and they have been unable to control radio shows and websites like yours and mine.
[00:08:48.162 --> 00:09:05.357]  And so this, I think, is a last-ditch desperate attempt to trick the people who are getting their news from the blogs and the internet and the radio shows from talking to the rest of America that is still getting all their news from ABC and the other networks because, you know... You know, it's funny you say that.
[00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:10.761]  I believe they came out with this on purpose as a chilling effect and now we have even more evidence.
[00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:13.924]  We're seeing a whole flotilla or squadron
[00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:15.325]  We're good.
[00:09:27.504 --> 00:09:36.451]  Predominantly in England, saying the Internet's evil, showing pictures of Hitler, saying should it be controlled, and they want you to go register with them to discuss it.
[00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:39.574]  So they're also at the same level, that's a triple-pronged attack.
[00:09:39.574 --> 00:09:49.101]  They're saying it's dangerous and evil needs to be regulated, but they're also saying come join us and discuss it, trying to become us, the alternative media, so yes, you're right.
[00:09:49.975 --> 00:10:15.474]  Yeah, right now the biggest problem that Bush and the neocons are facing is that people are talking to each other, and as you said before, the thing about the military being ordered to talk up the Iraq War, I experienced that myself directly recently when we attended a wedding of somebody who was about to go to Iraq, and he's there trying to talk up about the positive side of the war, but every time we ask him a direct question, he goes, yeah, well, yeah, that's true.
[00:10:19.976 --> 00:10:21.337]  Exactly, folks, here's the script.
[00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:25.919]  They go, I tell ya, nobody talks about the positive things that are happening.
[00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:29.280]  The liberal media only focuses on the negative.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.463]  When it's not a liberal media, it's lying, but they make it look even more extreme by then saying that it's liberal.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.401]  Absolutely.
[00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:43.967]  And it seems like every administration, when the press starts becoming adversarial, they just blame it all their bias toward the other party.
[00:10:43.967 --> 00:10:50.052]  When Clinton was in power, they were calling it the conservative press, was exposing his crimes.
[00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:51.573]  Vast right-wing conspiracy.
[00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:53.315]  Yeah, vast right-wing conspiracy.
[00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:54.036]  And it wasn't.
[00:10:54.036 --> 00:10:58.439]  A lot of things were being let out that the American public needed to know.
[00:10:58.439 --> 00:11:00.902]  And, you know, as long as the media is not
[00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:03.150]  Uh, putting this stuff out.
[00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.593]  Americans don't have the information they need to make good decisions, especially going into an election year.
[00:11:07.593 --> 00:11:08.733]  Michael Rivera, stay there.
[00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:15.698]  I want to talk about what you see happening in the next six months, the next year, and then I want to get into a whole host of other issues and take phone calls.
[00:11:19.773 --> 00:11:24.475]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:28.216]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:36.599]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:42.221]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:11:42.521 --> 00:11:48.027]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:50.389]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:11:50.389 --> 00:12:02.542]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:12:02.762 --> 00:12:07.405]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:08.526]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:10.287]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:12:10.287 --> 00:12:12.329]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:12:12.329 --> 00:12:12.849]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:13.069]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.990]  Currency devaluation, inflation.
[00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.590]  One and the same.
[00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:33.402]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:35.463]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:36.023]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:37.804]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:12:37.804 --> 00:12:38.284]  Here is reality.
[00:12:38.284 --> 00:12:40.324]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:59.373]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:12:59.373 --> 00:13:03.576]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:13:03.576 --> 00:13:07.639]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[00:15:21.433 --> 00:15:25.275]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:15:28.374 --> 00:15:34.257]  All right, specifically, we put a big article out this weekend on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:15:34.257 --> 00:15:37.859]  Headline, Dying Corps at Halliburton Sex Slave Scandal Won't Go Away.
[00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:41.740]  And I mentioned some of the topics to Mr. Rivera during the break.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.661]  I said, what do you want to talk about next?
[00:15:42.661 --> 00:15:44.142]  He said, well, that sounds pretty interesting.
[00:15:44.142 --> 00:15:52.666]  Of course, he knows about the general five-year saga of this, or six-year now, since they were caught doing it in the Balkans specifically.
[00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:57.348]  But now, the governor of Illinois has written a letter, and this is in the Chicago Tribune,
[00:15:59.043 --> 00:16:01.264]  And said, why are you blocking this?
[00:16:01.264 --> 00:16:04.146]  Why are you telling the Pentagon to not stop this?
[00:16:04.146 --> 00:16:10.910]  And openly, it's in the Chicago Tribune, they have lobbyists, I didn't even know it was that bad, who represent the slave trade.
[00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.530]  This is actual white slavery.
[00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.111]  And they're now doing it to Arab kids.
[00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:18.794]  They also grab whole villages of men and take them to be used as slaves for the contractors.
[00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:21.135]  This is Chicago Tribune, folks.
[00:16:21.135 --> 00:16:23.837]  And people are like, Alex, you talked about this in the first hour.
[00:16:23.837 --> 00:16:25.297]  You talked about this on Monday.
[00:16:25.297 --> 00:16:28.199]  Well, Fox News will spend six months on one kidnapped woman.
[00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:41.219]  I mean, this shows what psychopathic criminals... I think it's the number one chink in their armor, Michael Rivero, is the fact that DynCorp and Halliburton subsidiaries and others have been caught red-handed defending these practices.
[00:16:42.029 --> 00:16:42.830]  Yeah, that is.
[00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:51.656]  I think, you know, when you have an occupation army occupying a country and you see this sort of abuses, it really illustrates what's going on.
[00:16:51.656 --> 00:16:54.478]  I am hoping that this story will develop some legs.
[00:16:54.478 --> 00:16:59.101]  I'm certainly going to give it some additional emphasis in the next few weeks.
[00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:05.625]  But there's an old saying that the fastest way to end a dictator is to get him to act like one where everybody can see it.
[00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:11.009]  And for this sort of abuses to be going on where you're talking about children being taken into coerced
[00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:15.398]  circumstances like this.
[00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:20.281]  I mean, that really shows exactly what the real character of the American occupation is all about.
[00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:22.982]  Did you see that as a good sign?
[00:17:22.982 --> 00:17:26.484]  When Bush had to say, I'm not a dictator?
[00:17:26.484 --> 00:17:35.089]  I think it was a good sign, especially because he's having to back off that joke that he was making during his first year in office about how easy it would be if he was a dictator.
[00:17:35.089 --> 00:17:39.411]  And, you know, nobody's laughing anymore because it's very plain that
[00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:46.358]  Bush has done more harm to our country, our freedoms, and our way of life than any terrorist could hope to.
[00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:53.607]  I'm sure that, you know, in whatever afterlife he's sitting in right now, Osama is looking at George Bush and saying, Thank you, George.
[00:17:53.607 --> 00:17:57.251]  You wrecked the country more than I could have ever thought possible.
[00:17:57.251 --> 00:17:59.053]  And, you know, well done there, buddy.
[00:18:00.424 --> 00:18:01.665]  And it is.
[00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:06.187]  It's really what Bush has done, I think for all intents and purposes, he is a dictator.
[00:18:06.187 --> 00:18:11.829]  You know, if he acts like a dictator and talks like a dictator and walks like a dictator, then he's a dictator.
[00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:16.991]  And having a Congress... Well, give us some examples of that, because his own Attorney General says he is the law.
[00:18:16.991 --> 00:18:24.994]  Judge Dredd, the executioner, I mean, they actually... He says, I'm the war president, I can use war powers, I can break any law I want domestically.
[00:18:24.994 --> 00:18:27.675]  That is, in its very essence, a dictatorship.
[00:18:28.135 --> 00:18:32.058]  Absolutely, and you know, just because he says it does not mean it is so.
[00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:33.879]  I mean, Nixon tried exactly the same thing.
[00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:36.521]  He used to say if the president does it, it's not a crime.
[00:18:36.521 --> 00:18:37.741]  That is not true.
[00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:49.949]  We are a constitutional republic, and the bottom line is that anybody who raises his hand and takes that oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution is agreeing implicitly to abide by those rules.
[00:18:49.949 --> 00:18:51.430]  Well, it's simple.
[00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.832]  And I use this example because it's the best one out there.
[00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:57.454]  Just because the Supreme Court said black people weren't human beings doesn't mean it's true.
[00:18:58.034 --> 00:19:11.099]  That's absolutely true, and the bottom line is that George Bush is the President of the United States only when he is conforming himself to the limits imposed on the presidency by the Constitution.
[00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:14.401]  If he acts outside the Constitution, he's acting outside his office.
[00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:27.226]  He's just ordinary George Bush again, and maybe he's got a lot of people willing to go along with what he's saying, but he is not legally the President of the United States when he acts outside the Constitution, and Congress cannot vote him extra-constitutional
[00:19:27.686 --> 00:19:32.609]  Uh, powers, that takes a constitutional amendment, and the Attorney General can't say he's the law.
[00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:39.193]  All the Attorney General can, in effect, say is, I refuse to prosecute his crimes, which is really what it comes down to.
[00:19:39.193 --> 00:19:50.499]  Bush can do what he wants because he knows his buddies are sitting on the judicial benches and the Department of Justice, and they will give him a get-out-of-jail-free card is really what it amounts to.
[00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:51.559]  Absolutely.
[00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:57.261]  I think Bush was kind of a disposable ruler right from the beginning and certainly we see Dick Cheney as more of the capable
[00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:13.670]  I think?
[00:20:35.055 --> 00:20:45.018]  And unfortunately, most Americans, while they are aware of what's going on, they are still believing the government is going to play by the rules, and play nice, and obey the constitutional limits.
[00:20:45.018 --> 00:20:47.618]  And that's just not happening.
[00:20:47.618 --> 00:20:52.959]  It's not happening, and you give people unlimited power, unlimited funding, they're going to abuse it.
[00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:55.220]  And I mean, let's talk about some of the abuse.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.881]  I mean, just the no-bid contracts, the scams, the financial
[00:21:00.205 --> 00:21:03.687]  Soaking that we're all taking when we get back and we'll take your calls.
[00:21:03.687 --> 00:21:04.207]  Stay with us.

[00:23:18.115 --> 00:23:26.840]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.882]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[00:23:28.882 --> 00:23:30.402]  That's one in four adults.
[00:23:30.402 --> 00:23:36.766]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it, the American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.

[00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:26.176]  It is the third day of January 2006.
[00:24:26.176 --> 00:24:27.897]  Michael Rivera is our guest.
[00:24:27.897 --> 00:24:29.477]  We're going to go back to him in just a few minutes.
[00:24:36.129 --> 00:24:37.630]  And we're going to talk about the spying.
[00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:42.152]  We're going to talk about the contractors and all of the war profiteering that's going on.
[00:24:42.152 --> 00:24:45.253]  And I promise we are going to get to all of your calls.
[00:24:45.253 --> 00:24:48.754]  Stan, and then Rick, and Francis, and Ruben, and Davey.
[00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:51.435]  I have time for those five calls.
[00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:54.757]  Sorry to everybody else, but we will get to those five calls at least.
[00:24:54.757 --> 00:24:58.858]  Before we go back to Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, be sure and check that site out.
[00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:00.119]  Got a lot of great information there.
[00:25:00.979 --> 00:25:02.121]  Plus some great t-shirts.
[00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:06.608]  I was on there last night looking at one of them and I may just steal the design I'll say on air.
[00:25:06.608 --> 00:25:10.574]  No, I've seen on bumper stickers too, but think it upsets the government or something like that.
[00:25:10.574 --> 00:25:15.141]  People ought to go there and get one of those because thinking does upset them.
[00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:16.003]  The average American
[00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:29.662]  Will, who's pro-war, now about 35% of the people that are still idiotic enough, according to mainstream polls, I'd say it's even lower, they will argue with you about Iraq, but they literally can't find it on a map.
[00:25:29.662 --> 00:25:31.444]  They've done national studies on this.
[00:25:31.444 --> 00:25:32.625]  They know none of its history.
[00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:34.227]  They don't know anything.
[00:25:34.227 --> 00:25:37.090]  They've just got an emotional response.
[00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.152]  And so we'll talk to Michael Rivera about that.
[00:25:39.152 --> 00:25:41.234]  I'll ask him about that psychology here in a second.
[00:25:42.568 --> 00:25:43.631]  Year-end specials.
[00:25:43.631 --> 00:25:45.636]  We've extended them until the 7th.
[00:25:45.636 --> 00:25:48.163]  That's three and a half days, roughly.
[00:25:48.163 --> 00:25:48.885]  Three or four days.
[00:25:49.874 --> 00:26:08.127]  And PrisonPlanet.tv, all 14 of my films, all of my weekly TV reports, my special video reports from England and Crawford, Texas, and on weather wars with the father of weather warfare, Ben Livingston, where they could have stopped those hurricanes with old-fashioned cloud seeding.
[00:26:08.127 --> 00:26:10.449]  Forget all the other high-tech fancy dandy stuff.
[00:26:10.449 --> 00:26:12.931]  This is the, I mean, that's one of the reports that's up there.
[00:26:14.927 --> 00:26:18.090]  My new film, The Order of Death, is on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.971]  It's all there, 15 cents a day.
[00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:23.234]  The monthly subscription is $5.95.
[00:26:23.234 --> 00:26:34.724]  But folks, when you get a yearly subscription until the end of this week, I guess until Sunday, really, until the first day of next week, until the 7th, you will get 5.3 months free.
[00:26:34.724 --> 00:26:36.385]  That's what it calculates out to.
[00:26:36.385 --> 00:26:42.811]  You will get almost a half a year free when you get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership for one year.
[00:26:43.551 --> 00:27:02.182]  So be sure and take advantage of that, and if you want any of the videos and books that we're carrying on InfoWars.com, there are, I don't know, over 100 titles up there now of videos, books, books on tape, DVDs, t-shirts, you name it, bumper stickers, InfoWars.com.

[00:28:09.367 --> 00:28:14.790]  Going back to Michael Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com, Mike, again, I'm not being sardonic.
[00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.592]  I don't think of myself as the smartest person, the sharpest knife in the drawer.
[00:28:18.592 --> 00:28:21.514]  I don't claim that my elevator even goes all the way to the top.
[00:28:22.094 --> 00:28:23.135]  But I know this.
[00:28:23.135 --> 00:28:24.156]  I know human history.
[00:28:24.156 --> 00:28:25.977]  I'm somewhat of a history buff.
[00:28:25.977 --> 00:28:28.179]  I know the history of Iraq.
[00:28:28.179 --> 00:28:34.844]  I know how Saddam was the boy of the globalists, how they told him to attack Iran, how they told him go ahead and go into Kuwait.
[00:28:34.844 --> 00:28:35.905]  I know the setup.
[00:28:35.905 --> 00:28:39.067]  I know the Israelis in 83 said we want to have the U.S.
[00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:43.331]  go in, balkanize the country, break it up into four provinces.
[00:28:43.331 --> 00:28:46.093]  Now that's being done and being announced as some new plan.
[00:28:46.753 --> 00:28:49.114]  I know that it's all a scam.
[00:28:49.114 --> 00:28:54.217]  And then you talk to the average good ol' boy, and he's just, you're a dirty commie, boy!
[00:28:54.217 --> 00:28:56.198]  We need to kill all them Arabs!
[00:28:56.198 --> 00:28:58.559]  Well, they're not actually Arabs, they're Persians.
[00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.100]  Shut up, commie!
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:05.082]  Well, you know, the PNAC boy said Saddam wasn't a threat, it was about oil, and about weapons sales.
[00:29:05.082 --> 00:29:06.603]  Oh, you're a liar!
[00:29:06.603 --> 00:29:08.704]  You know Halliburton's ripping off the troops.
[00:29:08.704 --> 00:29:09.544]  Eh, shut up!
[00:29:09.544 --> 00:29:14.547]  I mean, what do you do when you talk to somebody who just doesn't know anything, but they've still got their opinion?
[00:29:15.285 --> 00:29:25.713]  Well, people like that, basically my advice is to not waste your time on them and go out and find those people who are starting to listen and starting to ask the questions.
[00:29:25.713 --> 00:29:36.342]  What you have here, there is a certain group of individuals who want to believe they're on top of everything, but they're basically too lazy to really make sure they've got a good beat on life.
[00:29:36.602 --> 00:29:41.324]  So they basically take whatever comes out of the TV and they figure well that's it and I stand by the government.
[00:29:41.324 --> 00:29:45.526]  You just crystallized something that I say in like an hour-long diatribe.
[00:29:45.526 --> 00:29:46.386]  That's it!
[00:29:46.386 --> 00:29:50.348]  They associate their power with this corrupt system no matter what it does.
[00:29:50.348 --> 00:29:55.090]  They don't want to deal with the threat so they engage in double think that Orwell talked about.
[00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.191]  They lie to themselves.
[00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:57.911]  They convince themselves.
[00:29:57.911 --> 00:30:01.333]  Absolutely and it goes one step further than that is and that is
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:14.107]  You know, we're all raised to believe that we're good, noble human beings, that we would take a stand to fight for truth and justice and take a stand against evil government if we had one.
[00:30:14.107 --> 00:30:23.972]  But a lot of people really don't want to face that choice, because when you find out your government is lying to you, your government is killing off leaders that you like and they don't.
[00:30:23.972 --> 00:30:25.753]  Kidnapping children and it's public!
[00:30:26.073 --> 00:30:29.354]  And you find out about it, and you have to decide, what am I going to do about it?
[00:30:29.354 --> 00:30:38.336]  And that's when you find out that maybe because of your mortgage and because of the rest of what's going on, you don't have what it takes to stand up to face up to a corrupt government.
[00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.797]  Well, most people don't want to admit that to themselves.
[00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:43.857]  So they're very grateful when the government says, oh, there's nothing corrupt here.
[00:30:43.857 --> 00:30:46.078]  We've got this crazed, lone-nut assassin over here.
[00:30:46.138 --> 00:30:53.805]  That's what Joseph Goebbels actually wrote a book about propaganda, and he said good propaganda speaks to the laziness, speaks to the procrastination.
[00:30:53.805 --> 00:30:54.966]  Oh no, everything's fine.
[00:30:54.966 --> 00:30:56.748]  It doesn't even have to be.
[00:30:56.748 --> 00:31:02.833]  That's why this stuff's all so transparent, but it doesn't matter because they know it's just a salve for lazy people.
[00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:04.475]  But I want those lazy people to know something.
[00:31:05.255 --> 00:31:08.818]  This system will feed on them, too, not just them dirty Arabs.
[00:31:08.818 --> 00:31:09.659]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:17.285]  You just have to look at the history of Germany in World War II, and it all worked really well for those in power, but in the long run, they ruined the entire nation.
[00:31:17.285 --> 00:31:25.753]  And the people who made the money, including the Bush family, got off scot-free, took their money and laughed their heads off over those dumb German people who fell for it all.
[00:31:25.753 --> 00:31:32.038]  And the same thing that's going to happen in this country, and it happens because good Americans
[00:31:32.705 --> 00:31:37.528]  Don't want to have to confront that issue of taking a risk to stand up to the corrupt government.
[00:31:37.528 --> 00:31:45.794]  But you have to look at people like Cindy Sheehan, who by the way is in Hawaii this week, to have the courage to stand up and say, this is wrong.
[00:31:45.794 --> 00:31:46.734]  We were lied to.
[00:31:46.734 --> 00:31:50.437]  Our kids are dying for oil and money and Halliburton.
[00:31:50.437 --> 00:31:53.519]  They're not dying for any noble purpose that we can get behind.
[00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:54.500]  We were lied to.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.641]  We were lied to about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:31:56.641 --> 00:31:58.622]  We were lied to about Iraq and Al-Qaeda.
[00:31:58.622 --> 00:32:00.143]  We were lied to about Iraq and 9-11.
[00:32:01.684 --> 00:32:08.054]  There was nothing about Iraq that was told to us that was absolutely the truth that we could rely on and say we can support that.
[00:32:08.054 --> 00:32:10.978]  Now we're seeing the same pattern repeat out with Iran again.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:19.283]  Well, Michael, I know it goes without saying, but I would guess you've probably been threatened before, haven't you?
[00:32:19.283 --> 00:32:22.045]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:22.045 --> 00:32:31.349]  But I'm always amazed when I get threatened because I guess from their cowardly view, the cowards that engage in all this evil and kind of service this whole corrupt empire,
[00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:37.154]  I guess to them being threatened would scare them, so I guess that's why they think threatening us.
[00:32:37.154 --> 00:32:39.436]  Folks, I get up in the morning when I get the threats.
[00:32:39.436 --> 00:32:41.579]  That actually has empowered me.
[00:32:41.579 --> 00:32:46.363]  I've decided to redouble my efforts because of the latest volleys of threats.
[00:32:46.363 --> 00:32:48.165]  I don't think they understand that we're just...
[00:32:49.706 --> 00:33:00.659]  I'm instinctive, Michael, and I see a threat to the species, a threat to my family, a threat by just a pack of scumbag criminals, and I'm going to fight these people.
[00:33:00.659 --> 00:33:03.282]  I mean, are we abnormal, Michael Rivero?
[00:33:03.282 --> 00:33:04.723]  Because we're disgusted by them?
[00:33:04.723 --> 00:33:10.710]  Because they tell us that we're crazy, that we ought to just not have morals, and that we should just join them.
[00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:17.152]  Well, according to the latest polls, we're not abnormal because about 85% of America is starting to agree with us.
[00:33:17.152 --> 00:33:24.954]  But the thing about the threatening and harassment, to me, when that happens, that's a signal that we're right over the target because we're catching the flack.
[00:33:24.954 --> 00:33:31.416]  And more than that, these kind of tactics are an admission that these people doing the harassment and making the threats
[00:33:31.956 --> 00:33:36.298]  Already, no, they cannot win the debate on the facts and the logic and the law.
[00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:41.400]  They are admitting that they don't have a valid argument when they resort to such tactics.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.261]  Because if they had a good argument, they wouldn't need tactics like that.
[00:33:44.261 --> 00:33:46.022]  And the louder they scream, we know we're bloodying them.
[00:33:51.084 --> 00:33:51.405]  Absolutely.
[00:33:51.405 --> 00:33:55.950]  You know, they're putting on this facade of being invincible, and we just keep stabbing them with the ice pick, folks.
[00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.613]  They're bleeding out right now.
[00:33:57.613 --> 00:34:04.501]  Well, I'm in agreement with George Galloway, who said last week that if it weren't for the peace movement, the U.S.
[00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:07.846]  would already be in Damascus and Tehran, and I'm in agreement with that.
[00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:09.848]  We can certainly wish them luck.
[00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:14.792]  I mean, that was the PNAC timetable was in the next 20 years to invade 66 countries.
[00:34:14.792 --> 00:34:15.973]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:18.415]  And, you know, it's global conquest.
[00:34:18.415 --> 00:34:21.077]  But, you know, they're definitely faltering.
[00:34:21.077 --> 00:34:24.140]  It's not going as smoothly as they anticipated.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:29.404]  I'm in agreement that they may try another stage terror attack to try and move the war machine along.
[00:34:29.404 --> 00:34:31.426]  You think they'll blow up the Golden Gate Bridge?
[00:34:31.426 --> 00:34:34.609]  Well, that's one of the targets I think would probably work for them.
[00:34:36.265 --> 00:34:40.889]  Well, Silverstein actually bought the Sears Tower, so look out there!
[00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:54.298]  Yeah, I saw that as well, and yeah, it's going to be another symbolic landmark, and if it happens, the thing you have to remember is, if these countries are so angry with our government, why are they killing the ordinary people?
[00:34:54.298 --> 00:34:55.459]  Why didn't they go after like
[00:34:56.266 --> 00:34:58.567]  You know, the Capitol building or the White House.
[00:34:58.567 --> 00:34:59.527]  Why don't they go after him?
[00:34:59.527 --> 00:35:00.087]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:35:00.087 --> 00:35:03.908]  Why would the Arabs attack us, knowing it'll bring down the wrath of the empire?
[00:35:03.908 --> 00:35:04.489]  Absolutely.
[00:35:04.489 --> 00:35:06.149]  That really is the ultimate thing.
[00:35:06.149 --> 00:35:09.130]  You know, why would they do something guaranteed?
[00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.251]  And then you happen to look at who they claim did it.
[00:35:11.251 --> 00:35:17.733]  It's a known CIA operative, Tim Osman, known as Osama bin Laden, with the supposed hijackers all training at U.S.
[00:35:17.733 --> 00:35:21.114]  military bases and defense language schools and all these public... I mean,
[00:35:21.555 --> 00:35:24.060]  Every time, you know, it's not just common sense.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.485]  Then every time you look at it, look, it's them.
[00:35:26.485 --> 00:35:27.668]  They're doing it.
[00:35:27.668 --> 00:35:31.195]  I want to get a little bit into the war profiteering and the rest of it, but we've got to go.
[00:35:32.131 --> 00:35:40.137]  We've got to go to some of these phone calls because they have been holding like true champions there, and I actually have my call list here in front of me.
[00:35:40.137 --> 00:35:41.038]  Here it is.
[00:35:41.038 --> 00:35:43.399]  Let's go ahead and talk to Stan in Missouri.
[00:35:43.399 --> 00:35:44.840]  You're on the air with Michael Rivero.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.741]  Thank you for holding, sir.
[00:35:45.741 --> 00:35:46.602]  Hello, Alex.
[00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:49.584]  As always, you've got a good guest on there.
[00:35:49.584 --> 00:35:50.624]  I wanted to talk to you.
[00:35:50.624 --> 00:35:53.827]  You're right on target about so many things today, Alex.
[00:35:53.827 --> 00:35:58.030]  They're setting up in the Smith-Cotton High School system in Sedalia, Missouri.
[00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.831]  They made it mandatory yesterday.
[00:36:01.454 --> 00:36:07.317]  They're gonna make them wear identification badges, the teachers and the faculty.
[00:36:07.317 --> 00:36:12.300]  They're also doing it in Warsaw's school system, Alex, and they're doing it also in Posey, Idaho.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.021]  I talked to a 19-year-old Mormon elder.
[00:36:14.021 --> 00:36:16.063]  He said they've done it in his school system.
[00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:24.832]  Five years now.
[00:36:24.832 --> 00:36:33.838]  Listen, I read the USA Today article a month ago where they said it's good and the feds are paying for total surveillance in all the schools, including the bathrooms.
[00:36:33.838 --> 00:36:35.139]  Michael Rivera?
[00:36:35.139 --> 00:36:43.224]  Well, that seems to be a lot of money being spent that could be spent on, like, making the schools actually better, better teachers, better classroom support.
[00:36:43.224 --> 00:36:50.129]  I don't know about in your part of the country, but out here, our public schools are so strapped for cash, there are not enough school books to go around.
[00:36:50.129 --> 00:36:53.611]  And yet we have the federal government coming in here to put in TV cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:36:54.651 --> 00:36:59.932]  There's something seriously wrong with an educational system that has more money for that kind of surveillance.
[00:36:59.932 --> 00:37:01.032]  But that's their education!
[00:37:01.032 --> 00:37:07.774]  Their education is how to wear a badge, how to have a camera in the stall, how to have cops in black uniforms shake you down.
[00:37:07.774 --> 00:37:08.174]  Yeah.
[00:37:08.174 --> 00:37:12.055]  They have 18 surveillance cameras in Smith-Cotton High School.
[00:37:12.055 --> 00:37:15.015]  But Alex is always, like I just go through saying, you've been on target.
[00:37:15.015 --> 00:37:18.616]  Their National ID card that they've implemented in Sedalia, Missouri,
[00:37:19.477 --> 00:37:31.851]  It's not going to work, Alex, and I'm going to tell you why it's not working, because you've got a vast criminal element due to the meth epidemic in Pettis County, and you've got 19-year-olds, 20-year-olds driving around with revoked
[00:37:32.412 --> 00:37:35.113]  Driver's License, Suspended License, D.A.W.I.
[00:37:35.113 --> 00:37:36.514]  Condemned Fictions.
[00:37:36.514 --> 00:37:41.915]  The only ones that are going to obey this S-9 law, Alex, is honest patriots like you and me.
[00:37:41.915 --> 00:37:45.297]  That's the way it's always been, and they're not going to enforce it against the scumbags.
[00:37:45.297 --> 00:37:46.617]  They're going to enforce it against us.
[00:37:46.617 --> 00:37:48.138]  Thanks for the call, Stan.
[00:37:48.138 --> 00:37:49.278]  Always good to hear from you.
[00:37:49.278 --> 00:37:52.259]  Let's talk to, up next, Rick in Michigan.
[00:37:52.259 --> 00:37:54.920]  You're on the air, Rick, with our guest, Michael Rivero.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.560]  Go ahead.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.901]  Well, how you doing, Alex?
[00:37:56.901 --> 00:37:57.201]  Good, sir.
[00:37:57.581 --> 00:37:58.842]  First time listener.
[00:37:58.842 --> 00:37:59.483]  Welcome.
[00:37:59.483 --> 00:38:00.844]  Man of my heart, I tell you.
[00:38:00.844 --> 00:38:02.845]  I've been listening for somebody like you.
[00:38:02.845 --> 00:38:04.166]  Well, I'm glad you found us.
[00:38:04.166 --> 00:38:07.609]  Well, first to say, we've all been bushwhacked.
[00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:09.170]  I'm sure you know that.
[00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.912]  Yes, we have been bushwhacked, yes.
[00:38:11.912 --> 00:38:16.955]  And another subject I wanted to bring up is some of the things you were talking about,
[00:38:18.433 --> 00:38:21.635]  The inoculations and so forth?
[00:38:21.635 --> 00:38:22.155]  Yes.
[00:38:22.155 --> 00:38:32.440]  Well, you know, all that is all about population control, just like cigarettes, just like gun control, you know, flooding the market with guns and every damn thing else.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.163]  And you've got every alcohol and they're all supplemented by the government.
[00:38:37.163 --> 00:38:37.403]  All of them.
[00:38:38.211 --> 00:38:39.572]  Well, you think they ain't going broke.
[00:38:39.572 --> 00:38:51.325]  Well, I know the government moves into every vice, and I think guns are good overall, but certainly the government, we found that in most big cities, it is police, this has been the news, who are involved in the illegal gun trade.
[00:38:51.325 --> 00:38:53.967]  Oh yeah, they're flooding the market with them.
[00:38:53.967 --> 00:38:54.828]  Anybody can get them.
[00:38:54.828 --> 00:38:56.610]  I don't mean all the cops, select people.
[00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.412]  You want to comment on what the Lister's bringing up, Michael?
[00:38:58.812 --> 00:39:09.516]  Well, yeah, there is a big problem with police corruption, and again, you know, the corruption starts at the top with the White House, and it just flows down through the entire social structure.
[00:39:09.516 --> 00:39:21.400]  All organizations are going to inherit the personality and the morals of the people at the top, and being a former resident of Los Angeles, I'm very much used to the idea of the police being part of the crime problem as well.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.482]  When I was in college, the best source for marijuana was the California Highway Patrolman.
[00:39:26.443 --> 00:39:28.046]  I knew another guy who'd been an L.A.
[00:39:28.046 --> 00:39:34.117]  cop who bought himself a Radio Shack store with the money that he got from reselling confiscated drugs.
[00:39:34.117 --> 00:39:35.379]  Rick, thanks for the call.
[00:39:35.379 --> 00:39:37.663]  I mean, I remember as a senior in high school
[00:39:38.698 --> 00:40:04.113]  One of my friends was the son of a prominent, a very prominent FBI agent, and I'd go to their house for like a barbecue, and I mean this was like a two million dollar house, right next door to, you know, well I'm not going to get into it, the point is, is that it's just, you know, I mean how many times do the cops, you know, I'm in a rich neighborhood and there's a cop living, and you're like, well what does he do?
[00:40:04.113 --> 00:40:05.494]  And it's just over and over again.
[00:40:08.798 --> 00:40:21.230]  Well, I have a friend, or rather, I knew a guy who was in the Secret Service, Treasury Department, not protective detail, but counterfeiting, and yeah, he had a very lavish lifestyle, including quite a collection of very expensive cars, so...
[00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:23.831]  Yeah, there's a problem out there.
[00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:30.233]  And of course, you know, you look at what's going on at the very top of the government, and everybody else is, well, why shouldn't I be playing the same way the boss is?
[00:40:30.233 --> 00:40:30.613]  And you know what?
[00:40:30.613 --> 00:40:33.393]  These crooks, you know, these crooks laugh at the good cops.
[00:40:33.393 --> 00:40:37.994]  Like, oh, look at that schmuck, getting $40,000 a year, can't even put his kids through school.
[00:40:37.994 --> 00:40:39.074]  It just makes me sick.
[00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:41.135]  Looks like Serpico all over again.
[00:40:41.135 --> 00:40:41.535]  It is.
[00:40:41.535 --> 00:40:43.055]  Francis in New York.
[00:40:43.055 --> 00:40:44.135]  Francis, go ahead.
[00:40:44.135 --> 00:40:47.896]  Yes, I want to wish you both a Happy New Year, Mike and Alex.
[00:40:48.716 --> 00:40:50.097]  And there are many issues.
[00:40:50.097 --> 00:40:56.020]  What I wanted to talk about briefly was the impending strike on Iran.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:01.243]  And I must say, Michael, I think your analysis is astute.
[00:41:01.243 --> 00:41:02.943]  And I wanted to raise a couple points.
[00:41:02.943 --> 00:41:17.451]  One, I cannot recall in the last 30 years more high-level leakers in governments and agencies around the globe releasing information regarding this, whether it was to the German press,
[00:41:18.178 --> 00:41:20.180]  Or the Turkish press?
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.903]  Or the British press?
[00:41:22.903 --> 00:41:42.661]  What's really frightening with the impending nuclear attack on Iran is that you are astute with regard to the fact that Turkey will not allow the Americans to use the NATO bases because a natural gas agreement has been
[00:41:44.701 --> 00:41:51.166]  ...made regarding Russia and Turkey, as well as distributing the gas to Europe.
[00:41:51.166 --> 00:41:56.431]  So even Italy, the Netherlands... So your point is?
[00:41:56.431 --> 00:41:57.271]  My point is this.
[00:41:57.271 --> 00:42:10.642]  I think we're going to see, after this attack occurs, we're going to see a breakdown of NATO, and when that happens, we're going to have probably a major world war, because we have China aligned with Russia,
[00:42:12.404 --> 00:42:16.026]  Stay there, I'm going to let you finish really fast on the other side and get Mike's comment on that.
[00:42:16.026 --> 00:42:18.027]  Stay with us, there's not enough time in the day.
[00:42:18.027 --> 00:42:22.450]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:27.013]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:42:27.013 --> 00:42:31.436]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:42:31.436 --> 00:42:32.737]  The New World Order.
[00:42:34.558 --> 00:42:38.841]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:42:38.841 --> 00:42:45.907]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:42:45.907 --> 00:42:48.289]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:42:48.289 --> 00:42:58.917]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:42:58.917 --> 00:42:59.718]  If you want to understand
[00:42:59.778 --> 00:43:04.760]  If you don't understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!

[00:43:17.702 --> 00:43:19.443]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:43:19.443 --> 00:43:23.684]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:26.625]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:43:26.625 --> 00:43:33.527]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:36.748]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:39.269]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:43:39.269 --> 00:43:47.152]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:43:47.472 --> 00:43:47.792]  That's right.
[00:44:18.883 --> 00:44:25.051]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:44:25.051 --> 00:44:27.514]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:44:27.514 --> 00:44:33.862]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:44:34.162 --> 00:44:34.823]  We're good to go!
[00:45:03.704 --> 00:45:05.606]  You know, I've got this minute-long clip.
[00:45:05.606 --> 00:45:06.326]  This is the new AOL ad.
[00:45:06.326 --> 00:45:09.609]  If you've got AOL, you sign up for junk service and you get spied on, folks.
[00:45:31.377 --> 00:45:40.083]  Where they demonize the internet and show pictures of Hitler and the Ku Klux Klan and say it's got to be regulated and controlled, come sign up with them and discuss it.
[00:45:40.083 --> 00:45:42.986]  And it's just multifaceted, multivariate propaganda.
[00:45:42.986 --> 00:45:50.811]  It's like local radio stations here in Austin put up signs saying, saying, don't, don't listen to our station.
[00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:53.373]  And then it makes you tune in.
[00:45:53.373 --> 00:45:54.254]  And so it's got that
[00:45:55.038 --> 00:46:03.562]  Yeah, at a level to it, but it's also demonizing the internet for more regulation, but oh, we're AOL, we're safe.
[00:46:03.562 --> 00:46:15.608]  I want to play that again, Michael Rivera's comment on it, so we can't really go back to Francis, but to comment on Francis's comment, Mike, about how this could really cause, well, they're calling it World War IV.
[00:46:15.608 --> 00:46:18.009]  They say the Cold War was World War III.
[00:46:18.009 --> 00:46:18.950]  Where do you see this going?
[00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:24.116]  Well, there's definitely a real danger because Russia and Iran are moving closer together.
[00:46:24.116 --> 00:46:27.439]  Russia is supplying sophisticated anti-aircraft missile systems.
[00:46:27.439 --> 00:46:32.905]  And, of course, Russia is providing material and personnel for the construction of the power station.
[00:46:32.905 --> 00:46:34.627]  And the real danger is that if the U.S.
[00:46:34.627 --> 00:46:38.612]  strikes those power stations, that Russian nationals will be killed in the bombing attacks.
[00:46:38.912 --> 00:46:42.954]  But we heard that about Serbia, and the Russians still backed off.
[00:46:42.954 --> 00:46:45.255]  They did grab the Pristina Airport.
[00:46:45.255 --> 00:46:46.996]  This is a whole other subject.
[00:46:46.996 --> 00:46:51.318]  I mean, isn't Russia to a certain extent in the same hip pocket as Bush?
[00:46:51.318 --> 00:46:55.360]  I'm not entirely sure about that with Putin in charge.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:03.964]  And I'm not entirely certain that the people that are pulling the ultimate strings don't see their own personal fortunes improving in a war between the U.S.
[00:47:03.964 --> 00:47:04.565]  and Russia.
[00:47:04.565 --> 00:47:07.126]  So they could actually engineer this and Bush is a bit player?
[00:47:07.526 --> 00:47:11.428]  Yeah, absolutely, because the idea would be that you've got the U.S.
[00:47:11.428 --> 00:47:20.833]  and Russia are two major powers, but if they can be tricked into killing each other off, or at least severely weakening each other in a mutually destructive war... That makes the international order even stronger.
[00:47:20.833 --> 00:47:27.316]  Yeah, then you have all kinds of other people who become, yeah, the New World Order becomes much more of an influence.
[00:47:27.316 --> 00:47:27.996]  No, I agree with you.
[00:47:27.996 --> 00:47:30.958]  I mean, internationally, they want to weaken all nation states.
[00:47:30.958 --> 00:47:32.779]  Let's go ahead and roll this AOL ad.
[00:47:32.779 --> 00:47:36.661]  Now listen to them demonizing the internet with images of Hitler and the Klan.
[00:47:36.661 --> 00:47:37.001]  Here it is.
[00:47:37.917 --> 00:47:41.400]  Some people think the internet is a bad thing.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:49.726]  Somewhere your identity can be stolen, your home invaded, and your savings robbed without anyone setting foot inside your door.
[00:47:49.726 --> 00:47:54.210]  It is one of the most dangerous weapons ever created.
[00:47:54.210 --> 00:48:01.195]  A way for the unhinged to spread evil free of supervision or censorship.
[00:48:01.195 --> 00:48:04.978]  A place for mankind to exercise its darkest desires.
[00:48:07.708 --> 00:48:13.614]  An open market where you can purchase anything you want.
[00:48:13.614 --> 00:48:15.315]  Orwell was right.
[00:48:15.315 --> 00:48:25.685]  The internet has taken us to a place where everything we do is watched, monitored, and processed without us ever realizing it.
[00:48:25.685 --> 00:48:30.349]  Some people think the internet is a bad thing.
[00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:31.130]  What do you think?
[00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:37.373]  So now, Big Brother is going to save us from the Wild West Internet.
[00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:40.095]  Meanwhile, DynCorp is purchasing the little children.
[00:48:40.095 --> 00:48:41.676]  But that's the government, that's okay.
[00:48:41.676 --> 00:48:44.278]  We've got to regulate and shut down the Internet.
[00:48:44.278 --> 00:48:46.359]  I mean, listen to the ominous music.
[00:48:46.359 --> 00:48:47.600]  Michael Rivera?
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:55.465]  Well, America Online actually began as a private network, where you had to really work through their system before you could actually reach the Internet itself.
[00:48:56.125 --> 00:49:03.554]  And for those people who've been around long enough to remember the history of how the Internet came to be, it was never intended to be accessible to the public.
[00:49:03.554 --> 00:49:09.201]  It was supposed to be a government-only tool, but it didn't escape out.
[00:49:09.201 --> 00:49:14.627]  And the government's biggest problem right now is how to bring the Internet back under their control and censorship.
[00:49:15.007 --> 00:49:23.952]  And I think ultimately what we're going to see is the big government-friendly companies like America Online and various other providers will become the front doors to the Internet.
[00:49:23.952 --> 00:49:24.892]  Well, that's Internet, too.
[00:49:24.892 --> 00:49:26.333]  That's exactly what they're planning.
[00:49:26.333 --> 00:49:34.397]  Yeah, and web pages will require licensing, and they're going to turn it into basically just another form of a TV network.
[00:49:34.838 --> 00:49:40.643]  Where the government message gets to you and everybody else is just supposed to sit still and passively accept.
[00:49:40.643 --> 00:49:43.966]  I agree with you, and I apologize to Davey and Reuben and everybody else.
[00:49:43.966 --> 00:49:44.987]  We'll have to talk tomorrow.
[00:49:44.987 --> 00:49:46.929]  I'm sorry to the callers, but I agree with you.
[00:49:46.929 --> 00:49:48.110]  But now there's a hunger.
[00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:49.832]  I don't think they're going to get away with it, Michael.
[00:49:49.832 --> 00:49:50.853]  I don't think they will.
[00:49:50.853 --> 00:49:53.215]  I think it's going to be proved to be very difficult to do.
[00:49:53.215 --> 00:49:55.157]  Hey, Michael, we're out of time.
[00:49:55.157 --> 00:49:55.717]  God bless you.
[00:49:55.717 --> 00:49:56.318]  Take care, folks.
